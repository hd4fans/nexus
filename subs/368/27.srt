1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,910
They say

2
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,920
that a split second before you die

3
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,630
your whole life passes before your eyes.

4
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,870
If the moron who said that had a bullet inches from his face

5
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,600
I wonder what he'd say.

6
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,600
That's me when I was two.

7
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,510
It's the only thinp I've pot of my mother.

8
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,960
This photo.

9
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,670
She said she pave birth to me in the street.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,150
Now I see I've been trapped in these streets all my life

11
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,160
and if nothinp chanpes

12
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,400
I'll never pet out of here.

13
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,430
NE0N FLESH

14
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,000
But let's start at the beginning.

15
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,240
Anyone born on the streets knows the world is split in two.

16
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,400
Those who buy and those who sell.

17
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,800
Those who supply the flesh

18
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,520
and those who fuck it.

19
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,760
You're on one side or the other.

20
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,480
Want a gold chain?

21
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,350
0K, I'll keep it.

22
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,550
Ricky, we have to talk.

23
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,320
I'm sick.

24
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,800
Fuck it, Princess, it's too early.

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,590
I'm suffering from anxiety.

26
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,360
I saw the psychiatrist.

27
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,470
He says I'm psychosomatic.

28
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,840
Princess has a screw loose.

29
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,600
She thinks the king is her father.

30
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,440
That's why she wears a blue wip,

31
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,200
the same color as her blood.

32
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,160
If she's in a pood mood, you can ask about her real name.

33
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,360
My name?

34
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,680
Juan Carlos.

35
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,400
Like my father.

36
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,870
Ricky, you know that really I'm an actress and a singer,

37
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,910
and artists in this country either serve tables or suck dicks.

38
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,470
The other day I was sucking a guy off.

39
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,430
It turns out he's a director

40
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,000
and he's making a movie.

41
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,030
What's it called?

42
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,710
"Maid to Suck". Is that cinema?

43
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,840
Well, it's cinema, more like "home cinema",

44
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,280
but, yeah, it's cinema.

45
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,310
Real cinema.

46
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,240
It's not what I imagined when I left the village,

47
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,360
but one has to compromise.

48
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,000
Stop, stop.

49
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,320
Do you know Glamour Muff?

50
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,950
She doesn't know Glamour Muff.

51
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,320
When I discovered her in "Gang Bangs of New York".

52
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,430
Chichi was like you,

53
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,600
a star in the making.

54
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,600
We had to make the chop.

55
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,790
Wait, wait.

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,400
Have I got this right?

57
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,590
They offered you the lead in a porn movie

58
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,920
if you cut off your dick.

59
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,600
That makes it sound a bit gross,

60
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,670
but he says it's anti-aesthetic.

61
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,320
What can I say?

62
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,190
I don't know.

63
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,310
You're intelligent and sensitive.

64
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,750
Since I had my nipples pierced I'm not sensitive anywhere.

65
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,710
I think: "Cut it off."

66
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,510
"You don't use it anyway."

67
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,950
But it's what makes transvestites a bit special,

68
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,440
it pays the rent.

69
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,470
But if I cut off my dick

70
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,160
I could be a movie star.

71
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,120
The world of movies, 0scars, red carpets...

72
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,440
I can't decide.

73
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,920
How do you get into these messes?

74
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,920
I don't know.

75
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,310
Go on inside.

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,120
Jesus Christ.

77
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,320
Edu, may I have a mint tea, please?

78
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,480
Hey, Angelito.

79
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,160
Ricky! Come over here.

80
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,680
Have a coffee with me.

81
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,480
Here.

82
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,790
What's up? Can't I have a coffee with a pal?

83
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,360
Scrag worked for Angelito.

84
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,200
They say she's hooked on smack but pives preat head.

85
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,520
Maybe because all her teeth fell out.

86
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,790
Angelito pimps Scrag and some other girls

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,200
but the one who really does the dirty work is Rocco, his dog.

88
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,230
He knows he can only be arrested if he's caupht threatening a whore

89
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,480
so he manages not to even touch them.

90
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,000
Go on, get her.

91
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,110
Scrag and me... We've got a lot of feeling.

92
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,000
I just do that, and she goes and works the street.

93
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,440
I got a present for you. Kid...

94
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,110
This is for you.

95
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,360
What the hell is it?

96
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,160
A suit.

97
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,230
Your mother's being released soon.

98
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,720
You'll look good in it.

99
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,600
What's up?

100
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,040
Don't you like it?

101
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,440
It's not that. It's just I'm a bit scared.

102
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,360
I don't know if I can face her.

103
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,870
Don't be such a wimp, Ricky.

104
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,720
You're going to go and pick your mother up,

105
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,910
dressed to the nines.

106
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,910
Shit, there's blood stain on this.

107
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,640
Just a few drops.

108
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,000
Hey, you try beating the shit out of a guy and taking his suit off.

109
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,400
Just try it!

110
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,400
I want to show you something back at my place.

111
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,670
We all know what your asshole looks like.

112
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,440
- Come on.- Edu, my tea. You are as slow as Molasses.

113
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,480
You got all this selling pills and hash?

114
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,150
I've been saving for five years.

115
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,430
You've got balls.

116
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,640
Who's to say the Kid and I won't slit your throat

117
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,120
and take the box?

118
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,080
A question.

119
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,960
To answer it, you need to know more about the Kid.

120
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,910
Two years apo, Scrap fell in love with a puy.

121
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,360
He promised he'd take her off the street.

122
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,670
Angelito and the Kid went looking for him

123
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,190
and, of course, ended up finding him.

124
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,510
Tell me where she is or I'll fry your balls.

125
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,240
I don't know.

126
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,800
I don't know.

127
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,800
Kid, will you tell that fucking dog to shut up!

128
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,110
Shit!

129
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,640
People say that the Kid always takes thinps literally

130
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,920
and that he once killed someone.

131
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,110
They also say he didn't have a pun that day,

132
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,990
he just threw the dog out the window.

133
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,830
Will you tell that fucking dog to shut up!

134
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,600
Motherfucker!

135
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,000
I don't know.

136
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,880
And Angelito is a liar.

137
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,960
But I know the guy talked, Scrag went back on the street,

138
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,440
and the next week Angelito appeared with a new dop.

139
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,710
Who's to say the Kid and I won't slit your throat and take the box?

140
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,830
Fuck off, you bastard.

141
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,040
Just fuck off.

142
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,710
You're a pal. What's this all about?

143
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,630
It's for my mother.

144
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,110
Building to rent

145
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,320
The Hiroshima.

146
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,630
I'm opening it for her.

147
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,560
The Hero-what?

148
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,720
Look.

149
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,880
When I was little

150
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,470
she always said she'd quit the street.

151
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,240
She said: "Ricky, you and I are going to open a club."

152
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,880
"A great club."

153
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,040
She wanted to call it the Hiroshima.

154
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,200
But she went to jail and everything got fucked.

155
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,800
No, I'm sorry, Ricky.

156
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,550
She dumped you and then she went to jail.

157
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,840
You don't owe her shit.

158
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,270
And, anyway,

159
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,110
why do you want to open a whorehouse?

160
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,830
Angelito,

161
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,480
maybe his mother likes the idea.

162
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,070
Yeah, sure.

163
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,320
My mother's dream is for me to open a whorehouse for her.

164
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,800
What a fucking lovely gesture.

165
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,390
So you won't come in on it?

166
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,430
Then help me with the girls.

167
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,520
I know where this is going.

168
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,520
You said you knew people who bring girls from Eastern Europe.

169
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,710
No, I said I'd a cousin whose friend...

170
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,720
I know what you said.

171
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,390
Listen to me.

172
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,240
I need three girls, four at the most. That's it.

173
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,190
If you want something that's a fucking money-maker, look.

174
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,310
Watch-calculators.

175
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,200
It's the new business.

176
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,440
They're in fashion again.

177
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,080
Don't touch that!

178
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,110
If you won't help me, OK, but this is for the Hiroshima.

179
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,470
No, don't you touch me, OK?

180
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,560
Look, the club business is run by people who are real bastards.

181
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,080
You hear me?

182
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,510
The street is shit, but it's ours.

183
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,520
- So it's over. - No, it's not.

184
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,200
I've had enough.

185
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,390
I'm doing this for my mother.

186
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,080
You want her to end up on the streets again, like us?

187
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,760
Where are you, Angelito?

188
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,840
We're both on the fucking street.

189
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,350
Angelito...

190
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,280
Maybe we could get him some girls,

191
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,720
couldn't we?

192
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,910
Shut up, you haven't got a fucking clue.

193
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,360
And you, Ricky,

194
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,000
don't ever say I traffic with Rumanian pussies,

195
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,270
or African ones,

196
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,830
or with whatever.

197
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,360
Kid, you are breaking my balls with the goddamned ball.

198
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,040
Come on, let's go.

199
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,880
See you, Ricky.

200
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,920
I don't like animals

201
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,920
and Angelito always dumps the dog on me.

202
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,040
It's mine, it's mine!

203
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,040
And people are really depraved.

204
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,680
Today a guy offered me 100 to do it with the dog.

205
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,320
The dog pulls in more clients than I do.

206
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,430
Kick it to me!

207
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,040
Look, it's your father.

208
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,880
How's my crazy boy?

209
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,550
Move, move, move.

210
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,760
- What's up, Angelito? - Nothing, it's all OK.

211
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,910
- On the ground. - Take it easy.

212
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,950
Come on, hands up.

213
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,870
Attack, Rocco, attack!

214
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,000
For fuck's sake, Rocco!

215
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,110
The cop, not the whores!

216
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,280
What about the two missing policemen?

217
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,800
You've lost two?

218
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,360
You guys can't be let out on your own.

219
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,440
Good for you, Kid!

220
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,110
Stop!

221
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,000
I've got him.

222
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,870
To all units in the vicinity of the port area,

223
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,600
a suspect is beinp pursued.

224
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,560
- Sweety. - Hi, dad.

225
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,320
- We've caught you again. - I wanted to see you, I miss you.

226
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,880
I miss you too,

227
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,070
but I've been really busy.

228
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,190
- With all this work... - Manuel!

229
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,150
- Hang on. - OK.

230
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,590
Can we talk?

231
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,600
Know why I run away from boarding school?

232
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,910
No one touches me like you.

233
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,390
No, I can't touch myself here, I'd be embarrassed.

234
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,920
Don't say that, please. You're making me feel wicked.

235
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,320
Are you talking to yourself?

236
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,640
No, dad.

237
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,040
Stop that nonsense.

238
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,280
- Shit! - I didn't even see it.

239
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,760
We have to take it to a hospital.

240
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,760
We're not taking it anywhere.

241
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,430
Fuck you, we won't let him die.

242
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,880
What's your name?

243
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,520
Rocco...

244
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,760
Look at what those bastards did to my face.

245
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,280
Fuck them anyway.

246
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,950
They can stick those two cops up their ass.

247
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,190
Angelito...

248
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,040
What a beauty! Where did you get those wheels?

249
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,830
Don't tell me you found Rocco.

250
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,760
What the fuck is this?

251
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,790
What?

252
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,750
Where did you find her?

253
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,000
Stop!

254
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,160
Stop!

255
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,880
Stop, police!

256
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,320
Stop!

257
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,390
Stop!

258
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,230
Stop moving!

259
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,320
Who the hell are you?

260
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,550
Stop!

261
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,960
What the hell is this?

262
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,080
This...

263
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,550
It's your fucking Easter egg.

264
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,870
A pussy with no papers.

265
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,190
You wanted into the business. Now you're up to your neck in it.

266
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,750
- Fucking great. - What?

267
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,000
Am I the only one here who's got any brains?

268
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,240
They'll find out about your club.

269
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,800
Who will? The police?

270
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,080
Fuck them.

271
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,880
Yeah, and Charlie's Angels can come suck my cock.

272
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm worried about Chino.

273
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,960
Chino?

274
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,590
Jesus Christ.

275
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,710
You don't even know who he is?

276
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,960
No.

277
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,680
Look, he's into everything illegal

278
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,000
and gets a cut from everyone.

279
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,110
I'll tell you a story about him

280
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,600
so you can learn.

281
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,800
Once

282
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,280
a narco who worked for him was arrested.

283
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,320
Chino knew he could testify apainst him in a trial,

284
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,360
and he put so much money on the guy's head

285
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,600
that the cops who were supposed to protect him, killed him.

286
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,800
So far, so good.

287
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,230
But the Colombian's mother wanted the puy who killed him

288
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,040
and Chino didn't want to lose the coke business,

289
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,800
so he took the first cop he saw,

290
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,200
cut off his hands,

291
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,910
cut out his tonpue,

292
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,110
and handed him over to the Colombian family.

293
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,760
If he finds out you're setting up on your own

294
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,960
your life will be shit.

295
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,800
It already is, he can't make it much worse.

296
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,780
Sell her to me.

297
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,150
3,000, right now.

298
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,280
Jesus, Ricky, you are so fucking hardheaded!

299
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,760
You want to set up all on your own,

300
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,030
just for your fucking mother.

301
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,480
And they're going to catch you.

302
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,710
And I'll feel like shit because I couldn't help you.

303
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,120
I won't sell her to you,

304
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,440
Ricky,

305
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,000
I'll rent her.

306
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,590
Hell, we'll get the shit kicked out of us

307
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,560
but you won't be the only one to make a packet.

308
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,680
Let's see the place.

309
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,960
It's a fucking dump, Ricky.

310
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,800
If you want to set up a real club,

311
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,430
we do it seriously, right?

312
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,190
First lesson:

313
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,550
No second-hand whores.

314
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,510
The Hiroshima is goinp to be a classy joint.

315
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,600
I've got a deal that you'll like.

316
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,190
I can offer you three knock-out women.

317
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,960
You can have Desi for 2,000.

318
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,200
Her tits are still firm, they're new.

319
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,920
Leti for 1,500.

320
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,480
Scrag is even cheaper.

321
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,510
No, not Scrag.

322
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,120
Not Scrag, no way.

323
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,550
How does she suck your dick?

324
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,800
She leaves your cock as good as new.

325
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,400
- Scrag for 200. - Forget it!

326
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,190
100.

327
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,680
3 for 2, like in the supermarket.

328
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,440
Don't go, dickhead!

329
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,080
Son of a bitch!

330
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,870
Have you seen my dog?

331
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,920
I can't sell Scrag, I can't even give her away.

332
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,590
That's OK, what about the others?

333
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,000
I've been thinking about it.

334
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,550
Scrag is bit of a nuisance.

335
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,280
It might be best if she had an accident.

336
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,400
- What? - What's up?

337
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,150
She isn't going to have an accident.

338
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,480
Are you saying I don't have the balls?

339
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,150
- Are you saying that? - No.

340
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,560
You're saying I haven't got the balls!

341
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,750
Listen, Angelito...

342
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,190
I haven't got the balls?

343
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,600
I'm not saying that. I'm saying you're talking about Scrag.

344
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,440
How long are you with her?

345
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,080
Maybe too long.

346
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,150
I'm hanging up, she's here.

347
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,790
What a great looking car!

348
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,120
Where are you taking me?

349
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,310
To the country. I've got a surprise for you.

350
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,520
That's what I said.

351
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,200
Angelito wouldn't sell me.

352
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,760
We've been through too much shit for him to get rid of me.

353
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,080
Pick up, Angelito.

354
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,160
Careful, love, don't hurt yourself.

355
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,680
Don't open your eyes.

356
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,640
And don't turn round.

357
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,240
You'll love this surprise.

358
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,630
Look, I've got two options.

359
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,040
I do it privately, and pay a fortune,

360
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,910
or I get it done on the State.

361
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,720
But there's a horribly long waiting list.

362
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,360
I never knew this country's full of fags.

363
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,270
Princess,

364
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,840
take her inside.

365
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,200
Angel, I thought

366
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,920
you were going to take me off the street,

367
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,800
that you and I...

368
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,430
Come on.

369
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,510
Forget him.

370
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,040
You're worth a lot.

371
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,280
But, you know,

372
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,870
you look like a Junkie-cow-girl.

373
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,640
Make more of yourself.

374
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,360
You had me scared, you old bastard.

375
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,560
If you'd hurt her...

376
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,640
What is this?

377
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,400
Stop that fag stuff.

378
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,880
We're buddies, but no fag stuff.

379
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,280
- Give me a hug. - No.

380
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,310
- Give me a hug, Angelito. - No.

381
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,880
- A man's hug. - All right.

382
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,390
Don't be angry.

383
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,310
All ripht, second lesson.

384
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,440
You've pot money, now find the pirls.

385
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,280
Where?

386
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,870
You're about to see.

387
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,470
Angelito,

388
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,400
it's first class stuff tonight.

389
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,720
For the clubs, real money.

390
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,680
Come on Monday.

391
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,600
You can get the leftovers.

392
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,350
Are you bringing your mother and your sister?

393
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,360
Look, look.

394
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,470
Great tits, a wonderful ass. We'll take her.

395
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,110
How much?

396
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,440
- Wait. - What's up?

397
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,320
Look at her arms.

398
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,640
- Shit, a junkie. - Yeah.

399
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,040
Fuck her.

400
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,710
0n the left, see that woman?

401
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,200
That's Frida.

402
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,400
She's the queen of porn.

403
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,270
She has a girl fucked in front of a camera,

404
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,190
from in front, from behind,

405
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,440
with dogs, with Arabs, with anything that's got a dick.

406
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,720
We'll continue with number six, Irina. Slovakia.

407
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,900
Natural blonde. 20,000.

408
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,920
Shit!

409
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,680
It's Loco. You have to be real careful with him.

410
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,520
Who's Loco?

411
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,630
Who's Loco?

412
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,240
It's obvious, isn't it?

413
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,720
He works for Chino.

414
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,070
If he finds out we're looking for material, Chino will find out,

415
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,800
so be careful, OK?

416
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,840
If you want any of them grab them now.

417
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,840
Go on, move.

418
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,870
Give me the bag.

419
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,510
Stand here and don't move.

420
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,510
Let's go, Ricky.

421
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,550
Gentlemen,

422
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,600
we're in a hurry, the car's double parked.

423
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,360
Come on.

424
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,680
Hey, are you following me?

425
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,550
Spying on me?

426
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,760
Who's this?

427
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,230
Rocco?

428
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,320
Look!

429
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,510
You big lump!

430
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,200
You're better!

431
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,760
You're better!

432
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,470
Angelito...

433
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,870
What is it?

434
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,680
You see how she looks at me?

435
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,680
The black woman?

436
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,800
It's like we're connected, like...

437
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,600
there are "fill-ins".

438
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,000
Like you and Scrag.

439
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,230
"Fill-ins"?

440
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,240
"Fill-ins"?

441
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,040
I think she looks more like she's shitting in her panties.

442
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,160
Didn't you want to get into the business?

443
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,240
Well, you're in!

444
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,720
Say a few words.

445
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,520
What do I say?

446
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,600
I don't know, your mother's a whore.

447
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,080
You've known the business all your life, right?

448
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,800
Go on, break the ice, champ.

449
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,000
You know why you're here.

450
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,320
This isn't easy.

451
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,070
Not for anyone.

452
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,480
Nor for you, not for us.

453
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,080
I won't lie to you.

454
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,710
This is tough.

455
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,320
It's shit.

456
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,790
Ricky...

457
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,480
You're scaring the fuck out of them.

458
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,040
I'm trying to help them.

459
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,040
No, you can't help them.

460
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,640
They'll eat you alive.

461
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,430
Watch me.

462
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,760
All right, this is the Hiroshima Club.

463
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,720
From today on, you are not going to leave here, ever.

464
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,000
Silence, a bit of respect

465
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,960
or I'm gonna have to kick your ass.

466
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,160
She don't understand

467
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,950
your language.

468
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,750
It's very clear, look.

469
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,800
We've paid a shitload of money

470
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,520
for each one of you.

471
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,230
And now you are in debt to us.

472
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,600
And there's just one way to pay it.

473
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,270
- Niet what? - Not do nothing of that.

474
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,160
What will do is we go.

475
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,240
- Are you the smartass? - What are you doing?

476
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,280
- I'm going kick your fucking ass. - You are bastard!

477
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,140
Hang on, calm down.

478
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,990
What's your name?

479
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,920
Irina.

480
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,550
OK.

481
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,690
You want to go?

482
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,410
Then go.

483
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,410
What'll you do out there?

484
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,410
Get a job?

485
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,620
You got papers?

486
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:28,980
You got money?

487
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,620
You got nothing out there.

488
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,170
You got nobody.

489
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,820
You want to get caught and sent home?

490
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,300
Here, we are

491
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,220
offering you a job.

492
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,650
- Decent. - Right.

493
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,570
When you pay off your debt we'll give you your papers

494
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,500
and you can leave.

495
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,130
You decide.

496
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,420
What's wrong with you?

497
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,850
If we can't go out on the street

498
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,860
how can we buy our things?

499
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,890
Here,

500
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,660
toy money.

501
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,980
You'll get paid in this.

502
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,580
The only currency in Hiroshima.

503
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,690
If you want to buy anything,

504
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,740
food, clothes, cigarettes, I'll sell it to you.

505
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,860
When you leave, we'll swap this for real money.

506
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,810
No dealing in euros. You get that?

507
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,300
Euros?

508
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,140
She has no fucking idea.

509
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,730
Look, yes, euros, euros.

510
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,140
All legal.

511
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,220
All legal.

512
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,820
Is that all clear?

513
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,740
Welcome to the Hiroshima.

514
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,340
Couldn't you have got a smaller sign?

515
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,660
And it's pink!

516
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,980
That's my mother's favorite color.

517
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,170
Yeah, but it looks a bit fudge packer.

518
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:57,930
OK, before we start fucking, let's look at the theory.

519
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,540
The Kid's brought a porn movie

520
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:03,580
so you can see all the stuff about postures and things.

521
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,090
Let's shape up.

522
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,500
Excuse me.

523
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:10,090
The gun's rubbing against the tip of my dick

524
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,820
it's giving me eczema.

525
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,980
My mother gets out tomorrow.

526
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,740
I want her to be knocked out when she sees it.

527
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,380
Then we'll take it down.

528
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,070
I'll tell you what I've got.

529
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,830
I call it "the fuck pack".

530
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,080
It's got one condom, wet wipes,

531
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,880
sheets in sky blue, they don't stain so easily.

532
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,910
I've got them in pale pink too.

533
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,080
You want to see a photo of my dog?

534
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,720
Me and Rocco.

535
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,950
That's me.

536
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,040
Look.

537
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,230
Like it?

538
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,550
Want to touch it?

539
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:55,990
No?

540
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,640
Can I?

541
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,240
It kicked me.

542
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,590
Now?

543
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,670
- Will I do it now? - Yeah, do it!

544
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,310
She's running away!

545
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,000
Kid, go fetch! Fecht!

546
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,200
I told you. This is because we're too nice.

547
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,390
I got her.

548
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,110
Angelito! Screw you!

549
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,350
Come in!

550
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,630
What a place!

551
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,120
Its fairground lights, its pinball machine...

552
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,230
It fell off a truck, but it's perfect.

553
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,880
Kid! That's good, I want to see all the balloons blown up.

554
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,640
Girls, smile, Ricky's mother is coming.

555
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,960
Let me see some teeth.

556
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,320
You! Don't get sick, I know you. You're putting it on.

557
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,270
Pleather armchairs, see?

558
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,680
And, most important,

559
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,920
a fireman's pole, so the girls can rub their muffs.

560
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,240
Scrag isn't too good at it.

561
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,400
She's practicing.

562
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,390
But don't worry. As long as she can move her pussy

563
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,710
we're all right.

564
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,880
And smile, it's not every day your mom gets out of jail.

565
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,000
Mom...

566
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,990
Hey!

567
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,030
Who do you think you are?

568
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,520
Mom, it's me.

569
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,190
Ricky.

570
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,360
Your son.

571
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,590
- My what? - Your son, Ricky.

572
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,920
What did you say?

573
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,680
My son!

574
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,110
What do you want, kid?

575
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,350
Look, it's 5,000 for the whole works.

576
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,880
3,500 for a blow job.

577
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,520
Mom, are you all right?

578
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,630
Do you feel 0K?

579
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,920
Jesus, kid, you're really going on!

580
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,830
You want me to be your mother?

581
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,110
Pay me, and you can call me what you want.

582
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,680
- We have to go. - Don't touch me.

583
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,310
I called a taxi, it's there.

584
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,520
Mom!

585
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,560
The minimum fare from here is 50 euros.

586
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,590
That's no problem.

587
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,000
You don't take pesetas now, do you?

588
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,920
I've got no dough.

589
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,800
I'll tell you what.

590
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,520
Take me out of here and I'll suck your dick. I'm a whore.

591
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,840
Well, not now. I'm being "rehabed" into society.

592
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,600
But I'll give you a blowjob, no obligation.

593
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,440
Shit for brains!

594
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,400
Hey, I'd rather go with you than rot to death here.

595
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,430
But give me 50 up front and don't call me mom,

596
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,160
or I'll thump you.

597
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,480
0K?

598
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,590
Shit!

599
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,710
Wow, classy joint.

600
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,320
Angelito, he wants to hump.

601
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,160
Do I take him upstairs?

602
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,240
Yeah, what are you waiting for?

603
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,200
Angelito! They're here! They're parking!

604
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,040
Everything's ready. Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

605
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,080
Let's have some action. You come here to fuck, not to talk.

606
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,720
It's for you.

607
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,280
Your welcome present.

608
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,880
I'm sorry, I think you've got the wrong person.

609
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,750
Will you listen and take off those glasses, mom?

610
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,600
Don't call me that.

611
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,400
Please.

612
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,990
Whatever your problem is, don't call me that.

613
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,840
Call me bitch and dump the mummy business.

614
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,840
How old are you?

615
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:51,880
23.

616
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,960
I'm 33, or 34, I don't remember.

617
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,750
How could I be your mother?

618
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,390
Kid! Kid!

619
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,720
When they come in, release the balloons.

620
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,400
Just pull on the string.

621
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,750
I'm wearing glasses because I'm sick.

622
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,590
The prison doctor told me

623
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,800
I've got that thing you get in your head.

624
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,120
A brain "rumor".

625
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,470
Hang on. A brain "rumor"?

626
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,440
- You mean a tumor? - No, it's not that.

627
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,440
It says it on this paper.

628
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,630
A what?

629
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,840
Here.

630
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:26,950
A "tsunami"...

631
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,720
I forget things and I can't remember anything.

632
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,880
They say old people get this "salami" thing,

633
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:36,150
but the doctor said it's because I hit the bottle so much.

634
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,880
Alzheimer's.

635
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,200
She's got Alzheimer's.

636
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,560
Welcome!

637
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,120
Fucking hell!

638
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,120
Mobila!

639
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,080
Give me something or she'll bleed to death!

640
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,110
Here, mom, take this.

641
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,520
This is shit! And don't call me mom!

642
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,160
This is filthy! You want her to die of "disinfection"?

643
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,590
Get clean towels!

644
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,310
Come on, Mobila.

645
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,110
Come on, come on!

646
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:17,880
Yes?

647
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,990
- Push, push! - Princess, I can't talk.

648
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,520
Push, push! It's coming.

649
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,390
We need more beer...

650
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,120
For fuck's sake! That's nasty!

651
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,550
Push, push!

652
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,240
Get her out of my face.

653
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,630
Seen this makes me not ever wanna fuck again.

654
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,320
Hey,

655
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,670
listen, are you never going to come?

656
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,880
That's it! Push! It's coming! Push!

657
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,790
Princess...

658
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,040
That's it, it's here!

659
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,150
What can I tell you? Cut off your dick!

660
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,840
And leave us in peace!

661
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,320
It's here!

662
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,200
It's a boy.

663
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,600
What the hell was that?

664
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,830
I'm sorry, don't hurt me.

665
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,480
I won't hurt you.

666
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,030
- Please... - I won't hurt you.

667
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,520
You want to hit him, Ricky?

668
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,680
Do you?

669
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,840
It really relaxes you.

670
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,430
Hey,

671
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,320
your mother's in a bad way. She doesn't remember shit.

672
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,520
Angelito...

673
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,640
- I'm finished here. - OK.

674
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,790
Can I go and see Mobila?

675
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,200
Yeah, go on.

676
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,470
- You'll let me? - Yeah, yeah, go on.

677
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,670
Hey, Ricky,

678
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,070
what about the black girl?

679
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,480
What do you mean?

680
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,910
The baby. She can't fuck and feed it at the same time.

681
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,350
What do you want to do?

682
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,910
Well...

683
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,680
I don't know.

684
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,870
We could kill the baby.

685
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:23,800
What?

686
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,310
How can you kill a baby, asshole?

687
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,310
Drown it in a bucket, like kittens.

688
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,270
Are you sick in the head?

689
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,600
You're not going to kill anybody.

690
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,430
You hear? And much less a fucking baby.

691
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,870
- But... - No.

692
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,640
- Why not? - Because I say so!

693
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,870
- 0h, yeah? - Yeah.

694
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,560
You think you're so smart.

695
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,830
I was joking,

696
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,480
but now I really am going to kill it!

697
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,040
I'll take that black baby,

698
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,470
stick it in the oven and eat it with fries.

699
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,280
You're a piece of shit, Ricky.

700
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,870
I'll get this guy out of here.

701
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,070
We don't want him dying on our doorstep.

702
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,350
Largo...

703
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,950
It's Ricky.

704
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,470
Listen.

705
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,150
Remember that guy you mentioned who gets children

706
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,840
for couples who can't have them.

707
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:29,920
Yeah.

708
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,510
Call him for me.

709
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,190
I've got one.

710
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,920
Yeah, just born.

711
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,790
How much do they pay?

712
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,640
What's up, Ricky?

713
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,960
I'm taking him away.

714
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,510
Why?

715
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,600
This is no place for a baby.

716
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,360
He can't stay here.

717
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,310
I'll give him to Princess.

718
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,790
She'll take care of him.

719
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,240
He'll be OK.

720
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,910
All right, Ricky.

721
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,470
Are you sure about this?

722
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,270
Taking a child from his mother...

723
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,000
We're going to give this child a family.

724
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,910
A real family.

725
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,520
- All right? - Sure.

726
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,030
We're doing him a favor!

727
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,960
- No, Ricky! - Take him.

728
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:12,870
Just look at that darling face. He's like a little black angel.

729
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,800
Yes, you're such a cutie pie, aren't you?

730
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,750
Can you look after him?

731
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,080
This baby will be no trouble.

732
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,560
You're a gift from God.

733
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,390
I know it hurts, Mobi,

734
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,920
but the baby'll be fine.

735
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,190
And you're pretty, you'll do OK.

736
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,640
You have to go downstairs or Angelito will come and get you!

737
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,800
Look at this.

738
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,390
The pills I've got left for the "tsunami".

739
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,350
No one pays for my treatment out here.

740
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,520
I'll have to go back to jail.

741
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:57,600
No.

742
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,000
Not leave Mobila alone, please.

743
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:02,830
I'll tell you what.

744
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:04,920
If you go down,

745
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,030
I'll stay a few more days.

746
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,070
Those guys are clowns,

747
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,560
but you have to be strong, they can't see you cry.

748
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,200
So,

749
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:15,880
0K?

750
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,000
Come on.

751
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,240
You see, Ricky?

752
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,510
It's working.

753
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,480
Your mother's in her element.

754
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,670
She might be crazy as fuck but she was born to be a "madame".

755
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,950
Why hasn't she left yet?

756
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,200
This morning she told me she was broke.

757
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,760
I lent her 100 euros.

758
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,430
She's staying for a few days. Maybe you two can have a chat.

759
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,320
What do I say to her?

760
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,120
China doll!

761
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,440
And she looked all innocent and shit.

762
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,520
Maybe she doesn't remember she dumped you.

763
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,790
Maybe she doesn't want to remember.

764
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,960
But you have to show you've got balls

765
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,520
and say to her: "You are a bitch".

766
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,270
Then she can fuck off.

767
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:08,470
But at least you've got that shit out of your system.

768
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,080
It was my birthday yesterday.

769
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,040
38,

770
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:15,990
and what have I done?

771
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,760
Not one decent movie.

772
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,630
Well,

773
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,720
the other day I met a transvestite,

774
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,000
star material.

775
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,240
- Didn't you want a beer? - Yeah.

776
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:27,760
A transvestite.

777
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,240
She's got everything,

778
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,960
but she's having the operation.

779
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,110
Wise guy,

780
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,880
what did you do with the baby? Did you eat it?

781
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:46,480
What baby?

782
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,160
The black girl's baby.

783
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,320
What baby?

784
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,270
- The black baby. - What baby?

785
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,880
The black baby, you bastard!

786
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,640
- What baby, Angelito? - The fucking baby!

787
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,630
Are you dumb?

788
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:00,960
Princess has him.

789
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,310
I spoke to Largo, we're selling him to a couple with money.

790
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,150
You smart bastard.

791
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,680
I'll see to it.

792
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,040
How much for the baby?

793
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,280
25?

794
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,550
Ask for 30.

795
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,200
How much does he get?

796
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,710
No, give it directly to the couple,

797
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,230
so find out who the hell they are.

798
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,040
Your move.

799
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,310
Where am I?

800
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,830
Where am I? Who are you?

801
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,240
I haven't introduced myself.

802
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,390
Everyone calls me Chino.

803
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,110
Don't believe all you hear about me.

804
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:29,680
Your move.

805
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,200
I don't know what I'm doing here.

806
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:35,990
Your move.

807
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,990
I'm missing my queen.

808
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:51,560
My son won it from me in a game and I insisted he keep it as a trophy.

809
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,150
Since then, I play without a queen.

810
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,510
I don't know much about this.

811
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,550
But you know about other things, don't you?

812
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,440
I don't understand.

813
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:05,990
Don't lie to me.

814
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,640
Right now you'd like to be somewhere else, wouldn't you?

815
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,270
But, unwittingly, your movements

816
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,040
brought you here.

817
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:16,800
I'm not lying.

818
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,200
Very well.

819
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,880
I'm going to tell you a story,

820
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,360
a story about respect and about

821
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,350
how one must accept the consequences of one's actions.

822
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:32,950
Two months ago,

823
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,830
the police lifted my son.

824
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:37,870
For nothing.

825
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,120
He was drunk and got in a fight.

826
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,800
He was 19.

827
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,520
They hit him too hard.

828
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,880
He died right there.

829
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,680
It seems they got scared

830
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,070
and so

831
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,080
they got rid of his body.

832
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,000
You wouldn't know where they hid his body,

833
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,680
would you, Ricky?

834
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,070
What is this?

835
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,070
What do you want me to do?

836
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,070
Right now, just look.

837
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,200
I've got three policemen.

838
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,270
Actually, one of them died.

839
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,550
He didn't last long.

840
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,760
But first he helped me find the other two.

841
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:34,320
0ne of these bastards split my son's skull.

842
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,520
The other just watched.

843
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,320
In your opinion,

844
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,840
which is the guilty one?

845
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,960
It's hard, I know, because

846
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,310
all the police look like murderers,

847
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,670
but what do you think?

848
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,310
Get up.

849
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,640
Get up, come here and answer my question.

850
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,480
Don't make me get you.

851
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,230
Well?

852
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,240
Which of them is the murderer?

853
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,230
This one.

854
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,030
I didn't do anything!

855
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,640
Neither did my son.

856
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,710
I just obeyed the commanding officer!

857
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,800
We'll take care of him too when the time comes.

858
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,720
No! No!

859
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:45,750
Get the other one ready.

860
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,710
You're working here without my permission.

861
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,560
That means 50% of the take.

862
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,590
Plus a fine for not respecting your elders.

863
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:19,350
Let's say

864
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,440
100,000 within a week.

865
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:23,680
0K?

866
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:26,910
0r I'll burn the club,

867
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,480
with your mom inside.

868
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,400
Dear mother,

869
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:28,160
On September 10, my baby was born.

870
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,200
I have him with me now.

871
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,990
He is a beautiful boy.

872
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,600
I would like to go back soon to the sea,

873
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:41,320
to your side, so that my son can know his prandmother.

874
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:07,950
Shit!

875
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,200
Why are you in my bed?

876
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,120
What?

877
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,310
Are you trying to talk your way into my bed?

878
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:13,320
What?

879
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,270
Don't try that little boy shit with me.

880
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,590
Fuck! Yes?

881
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,350
- Ricky! - Yeah, what?

882
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,760
Where the hell were you?

883
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,760
We're in really big shit...

884
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,630
I'm sick of this place. I'm leaving.

885
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:26,750
Ricky!

886
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:27,600
What?

887
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,520
It's Frida.

888
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,280
She'll beat the shit out of me if we don't give her a girl.

889
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,150
What?

890
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:35,400
- I'm going back to jail. - Will you shut up for minute?

891
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,070
He's hung up.

892
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,430
I wasn't going to tell you, but what the hell.

893
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,070
I've missed a period, I'm knocked up.

894
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,240
Christ!

895
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:46,920
And

896
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,640
I won't have a child out here where there's nothing,

897
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,320
so I'm going back to jail.

898
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,000
They'll look after me.

899
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,320
How are you pregnant?

900
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:56,750
- Princess... - Ricky.

901
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:57,920
You won't believe it.

902
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:02,310
The baby wouldn't take a bottle, and he grabbed on to my tits,

903
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,840
I swear on your mother that milk came out.

904
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,750
Well, maybe it was silicone,

905
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,200
but something came out.

906
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,110
Angelito...

907
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,320
Listen to me.

908
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,350
You've got a girl that I want.

909
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,120
And I want her tomorrow.

910
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,000
0r else this little shit

911
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,320
won't have a face.

912
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,320
She's a tall black girl.

913
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,480
No, that girl isn't available.

914
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,510
We can give you another girl.

915
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,870
You see, the director we work with

916
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,040
has taken a fancy to her.

917
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:36,160
He wants her for his new movie and I don't want to disappoint him.

918
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,000
Ricky, for fuck's sake,

919
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:40,510
if they want a whore let them have her.

920
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,390
0K, but we'll do it my way.

921
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,240
That's not what I want.

922
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:45,110
Listen...

923
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:46,990
First, let Angelito go.

924
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,430
If you keep your part, you get the girl tomorrow.

925
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,000
If not, there's no deal.

926
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,750
So you'll have to trust me.

927
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,360
That kid...

928
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:59,840
He's got a mouth on him.

929
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:06,320
"Pablo Diaz, son of Victor Diaz, alias Chino,"

930
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,960
"arrested July 23

931
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,150
after a street fight."

932
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,920
"He had head injuries."

933
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:14,190
"The officers said the prisoner struggled and fell down the stairs."

934
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,280
"After interrogation, the prisoner was released."

935
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,310
- Who signed the report? - You know.

936
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:21,590
Yes, you.

937
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,600
It's all very well that you protect your people,

938
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:28,480
but in the last 72 hours your whole team has vanished.

939
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,160
And you want me to believe this report?

940
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:34,640
That the boy left here alive?

941
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,830
Trust me,

942
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:38,360
or you'll be on your own.

943
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,790
Look what I bought for Mobila.

944
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:05,870
Lovely, isn't it?

945
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:10,900
Thanks, Rafaelito.

946
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:14,460
Ricky, my pal.

947
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:17,610
Fuck you, they nearly killed me!

948
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:19,780
But you're alive, aren't you?

949
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:25,260
- You hurt me. - You can go fuck yourself.

950
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:29,380
- Apologize to him. - Yeah, and I'll suck his dick too.

951
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:32,780
Since you last sucked my dick you want some more.

952
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:34,260
Cut out the fag stuff.

953
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:37,260
Come on, you know you can't get enough of it.

954
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:39,370
This is all for you.

955
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:42,260
- I'll beat the jokes out of you. - For you.

956
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:45,930
Come here.

957
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:52,260
Six, seven...

958
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:54,580
9,580, that's all there is.

959
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:57,620
Tell me how we can pay Chino.

960
00:57:57,820 --> 00:57:58,890
No, you tell me.

961
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,170
The black girl's baby.

962
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,100
Weren't you going to sell it?

963
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:04,290
Yeah, 30,000.

964
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:07,300
We could bring the swap forward to tomorrow,

965
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,170
but it's not enough.

966
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:12,130
I could give back Mobila's present.

967
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:14,010
No, don't worry, Kid.

968
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:17,020
You tell him about the black girl?

969
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:18,250
What?

970
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,970
- What about Mobila? - Nothing.

971
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:22,660
Nothing.

972
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:24,170
Go up and see her.

973
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:32,370
Are you fucking stupid?

974
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:35,410
Are you going to tell him about Mobila?

975
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:38,580
I won't say I told you so, because you hate that,

976
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:40,530
but the one time I'm right...

977
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:45,130
- I told you so! - Yeah, you did!

978
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:47,730
I said to stay on the street

979
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:49,770
but you decided we could move up in the world.

980
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:50,570
Well, no.

981
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:54,220
We have to be down below, eating shit, you hear?

982
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:56,060
They're on a different level.

983
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:58,010
You know what Chino pays Loco?

984
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:00,740
50,000 euros.

985
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:02,930
For slapping somebody around.

986
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:05,820
The other day, Bobbie told me

987
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:08,460
that this week he'd get thousands more

988
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:10,610
for kidnapping a cop's daughter.

989
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:12,140
What?

990
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:15,290
Chino must want to fuck the girl.

991
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:17,970
He's a smart bastard.

992
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:20,140
I'd like to fuck her brains out.

993
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,890
A cop's daughter, a different level.

994
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:29,580
How much do you think he'll pay Loco to kidnap her?

995
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:31,620
Why, Ricky?

996
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:37,890
The girl goes to a school, so check it out.

997
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:40,690
There can't be many cops' daughters there.

998
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:42,100
And another thing,

999
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:44,020
we're going to turn the tables.

1000
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:47,100
They won't fuck us, you hear?

1001
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:49,570
They won't fuck us.

1002
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:54,570
All right.

1003
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:55,900
You take Mobila,

1004
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:57,850
you bring her to Frida's store.

1005
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,140
Look, it's all written down here.

1006
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:01,330
Calculatinp the route.

1007
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:03,180
- It talks. - Yeah, it talks.

1008
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:04,970
You do whatever it tells you.

1009
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:07,250
Then you pick up the chick with money.

1010
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:08,100
And go where?

1011
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:10,290
To the beach.

1012
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:11,490
To the cove.

1013
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:13,100
You leave her there. That's it.

1014
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:15,420
If you have a problem, call me.

1015
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:18,180
0K, and you're paying me 500 euros for this?

1016
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:19,940
No messing.

1017
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:23,020
Then I'll go back to jail and you'll never see me again

1018
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:25,330
0K, tomorrow you leave.

1019
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:27,820
You can go to jail or wherever you like.

1020
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:30,540
I know that.

1021
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:33,340
I know I promised you, love.

1022
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:36,620
Veronica, it's impossible, I'm tied up all weekend.

1023
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:39,050
I'll send someone I trust.

1024
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:40,500
Yes, a policeman.

1025
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:43,580
What the hell is it now?

1026
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:46,010
I'll answer any way I want.

1027
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:47,860
Doesn't he get worked up?

1028
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:49,850
It turns me on.

1029
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:52,220
I like men with a temper.

1030
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,090
...you take the money...

1031
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:57,690
Why is it that we women always go for the biggest bastards?

1032
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:59,220
You should know.

1033
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:00,410
No, you should.

1034
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:03,690
Angelito treats you like shit and won't even let you go out.

1035
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:05,380
I'll shut up.

1036
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:07,100
No, it's true.

1037
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:10,850
I don't get out much.

1038
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:13,580
But where would I go?

1039
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:16,100
Look, you take Mobila.

1040
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:18,250
Leave her with Frida.

1041
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:19,580
Who's Mobila?

1042
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:22,460
She works here. Haven't you seen her?

1043
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:24,610
He's hers.

1044
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:26,220
Hers...

1045
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:28,900
If we're gonna get possessive, I'm breast feeding him.

1046
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:32,260
How nice.

1047
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:34,450
You've brought me to a lovely spot.

1048
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:36,380
- Relax, Marisa. - Yes, sure.

1049
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:38,540
You want them to rob us and rape me?

1050
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:41,300
- Marisa... - On our wedding anniversary.

1051
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,460
- Relax. - Fucking unbelievable.

1052
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:47,730
- This is what we agreed. - Great.

1053
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:50,780
- Have you brought the package? - No, no package.

1054
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:52,570
She has to come with me.

1055
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:54,220
Yes, but...

1056
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:57,020
Ricky said that. She can come or not, I don't care.

1057
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:59,900
Darling, go with the lady, please.

1058
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:01,170
Trust me.

1059
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:02,820
This is my surprise?

1060
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:05,090
How lovely... Don't touch me!

1061
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:06,660
If I can get away from you...

1062
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:10,620
It'll turn out that I'm the only one here with balls.

1063
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:13,660
Girls, you got a light?

1064
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:17,060
These "Basque" girls are so rude.

1065
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:18,900
You're to take the baby

1066
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:21,020
and go to the beach.

1067
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:23,500
You'll meet a woman there.

1068
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:25,690
Do you know where the cove is?

1069
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:26,900
There.

1070
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:28,980
Why don't I go to her house?

1071
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:30,740
Don't you start too.

1072
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:32,860
It's safest to do the exchange on the beach.

1073
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:34,540
Now that you mention it,

1074
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:36,260
am I bit overdressed?

1075
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:39,370
I had a camouflage suit too, but an exchange...

1076
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:40,700
I've never done one.

1077
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:42,180
Princess!

1078
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:44,620
Are you going to do it or not?

1079
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:46,980
Are you sure about this?

1080
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:50,290
You have to think about the baby's happiness.

1081
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:54,370
They might be rich but maybe they're lousy parents.

1082
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:57,820
Move your ass.

1083
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:01,100
You are at your destination.

1084
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:02,930
This is it.

1085
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:05,540
Ricky told me very clearly.

1086
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:09,540
Wait.

1087
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:11,580
This is for you.

1088
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:19,010
Give me a kiss.

1089
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:26,890
Take care.

1090
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:57,850
I'll take this,

1091
01:03:58,060 --> 01:03:59,500
and you guys, this.

1092
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:02,700
What the hell is this?

1093
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:06,940
A pellet gun. It's all I could find in two hours.

1094
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:09,700
But if you half close your eyes,

1095
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:11,010
it looks real.

1096
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:12,620
Great, and the masks?

1097
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:14,100
Fucking hell.

1098
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:16,290
I knew I forgot something.

1099
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:19,820
Kid, see if you can find anything we could use.

1100
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:21,010
Another thing.

1101
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:25,380
Let's synchronize our watches. This one's for you.

1102
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:29,980
Don't laugh. For once, we're being professionals.

1103
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:31,090
Fuck that.

1104
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:34,540
They're paying me 500 euros for this.

1105
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:36,620
Tomorrow I'll buy a shotgun,

1106
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:39,010
go to a supermarket,

1107
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:40,940
hold it up,

1108
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:42,700
and that's it.

1109
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:44,020
It's over there.

1110
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:47,540
I'm not gonna sit here chatting all day long.

1111
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:49,650
You're a pain in the ass.

1112
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:52,700
Say Ricky sent you!

1113
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:56,450
Excuse me.

1114
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:58,180
Ricky sent me.

1115
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:01,610
Great.

1116
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:05,100
This is the black whore I asked for.

1117
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:06,530
Call Frida.

1118
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:10,380
I've been thinking,

1119
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:13,780
and it isn't right to go round kidnapping people.

1120
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:17,220
Yeah, like you've never kidnapped anyone.

1121
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:21,490
The black girl.

1122
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:24,290
That was because I love her.

1123
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:27,370
Like hell you love her.

1124
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:31,580
Have you told him about the black girl?

1125
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:33,740
Tell him.

1126
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:50,690
I'm going to run out of credit.

1127
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:52,300
Hi, it's me.

1128
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:54,650
I've got the money for the operation.

1129
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:57,500
I've something to do, then I'll go to the studio.

1130
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:59,820
0K, kisses, ciao.

1131
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:02,890
That director...

1132
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:05,660
Always on about me having a sex change.

1133
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:07,900
It's not that I don't want to.

1134
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:10,900
How can I put it?

1135
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:12,780
Cinema,

1136
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:14,700
you know, movies,

1137
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:16,220
will always be there,

1138
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:17,770
after I'm dead.

1139
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:21,620
When you're older you can go and see it

1140
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:24,180
and tell your friends: "Look",

1141
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:26,770
"that one is my mother."

1142
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:48,730
Shit, it's all so complicated.

1143
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:49,810
Well,

1144
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:51,770
now I have to put you in the dog carrier.

1145
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:53,810
Ricky says it's safer.

1146
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:05,820
Hey!

1147
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:08,490
Are you here for the exchange?

1148
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,780
Look at her, swimming in her clothes.

1149
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:13,370
Like it was Ibiza.

1150
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:17,140
Jet set people are so weird.

1151
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:20,340
Hello.

1152
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:22,340
I brought this for you.

1153
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:23,980
But first give me the money.

1154
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:26,220
You're a foreigner.

1155
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:34,850
I'll do this fast before I change my mind.

1156
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:37,130
I want to ask you something important.

1157
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:40,060
Bath the baby every night at 9:30.

1158
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:41,740
You mustn't miss a day.

1159
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:43,660
And sing to him,

1160
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,340
even in your language.

1161
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:47,740
I always sing him to sleep.

1162
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:50,770
Well,

1163
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:52,420
look after him.

1164
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:23,690
Ma'am,

1165
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:25,850
everything OK?

1166
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:27,610
Yeah, right.

1167
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:29,450
Ma'am...

1168
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:32,540
Ma'am, why are you running?

1169
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:33,780
For fuck sake...

1170
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:35,660
My mother always said that.

1171
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:38,860
"You've got a suspicious face, you scare people."

1172
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:40,660
Shit.

1173
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:44,610
Let's move, they're here.

1174
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:07,660
I'll get changed and we'll do something, 0K?

1175
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:15,330
Right, put on your masks.

1176
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:20,620
What the fuck are these meant to be?

1177
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:38,250
Hi, there.

1178
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:39,770
Everything OK?

1179
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:45,660
Kid, she's there.

1180
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:48,260
What a house.

1181
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:51,370
Very nice, yes, indeed.

1182
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:52,570
Very nice.

1183
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:08,490
Cover her mouth!

1184
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:10,220
Come on, Ricky!

1185
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:16,740
Loco, drop the gun! Drop it!

1186
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:17,930
Put it down!

1187
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:19,210
0n your knees.

1188
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:22,220
Drop the fucking gun, you bastard!

1189
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:23,140
Come on!

1190
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:33,170
Rocco?

1191
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:35,020
Is that you, Rocco?

1192
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:37,220
You're Rocco.

1193
01:10:37,780 --> 01:10:39,930
What the hell are you doing here?

1194
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:50,500
We're together again, everything'll be fine.

1195
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:10,620
Come on, for fuck's sake!

1196
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:27,780
Pick up, dad, please.

1197
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:44,460
It's all right, Angel.

1198
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:46,170
It's all right.

1199
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:48,690
Pick up, please! Pick up!

1200
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:50,450
Hang up the phone.

1201
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:55,410
Hang up the fucking phone!

1202
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:12,540
Kid, listen to me.

1203
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:14,730
We have to leave, the police are coming.

1204
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:20,260
Angelito is dead.

1205
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:22,380
No, Ricky.

1206
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:25,810
You have to help me.

1207
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:28,780
You have to help me. 0K, champ?

1208
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:52,980
Yeah?

1209
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:56,900
No, Loco can't come to the phone.

1210
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:58,930
Listen, I have to talk to Chino.

1211
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:00,410
Yeah?

1212
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:03,300
Tell him I've got the cop's daughter and he might answer!

1213
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:05,380
Kid, what are you doing?

1214
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:09,220
Kid!

1215
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:12,500
Kid! Where the hell are you going?

1216
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:14,620
Kid, for fuck's sake!

1217
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:18,570
Kid!

1218
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:51,620
I've come for the new girl.

1219
01:13:53,140 --> 01:13:54,420
I'm taking her.

1220
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:55,930
I don't want to hurt anyone.

1221
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:57,180
Hello!

1222
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:58,580
I've come to see the director.

1223
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:02,260
Kid, why are you here?

1224
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:05,890
Well,

1225
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:07,740
Bad timing, right?

1226
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:09,820
I'd better be going.

1227
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:11,700
Tell the director

1228
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:13,540
I've got the money for the operation.

1229
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:15,970
I'll pick it up and go.

1230
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:20,220
What lousy kind of money did she give me?

1231
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:44,770
Princess...

1232
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:50,610
What the hell's goinp on? I can't film with this racket/

1233
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:02,010
What did you do?

1234
01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:03,580
Call an ambulance!

1235
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:15,700
Mobila?

1236
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:18,900
Where's Mobila?

1237
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:39,130
Are you sure you heard shots?

1238
01:15:55,780 --> 01:15:59,410
- Come on, Kid, come on! - No, they've taken Mobila.

1239
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:01,500
She isn't here.

1240
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:03,610
For fuck's sake!

1241
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:05,180
Come on, let's go.

1242
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:09,180
They're not going to screw us.

1243
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:11,860
They're not. Are you with me?

1244
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:14,340
- Yes, Ricky. - They won't catch us.

1245
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:16,340
This is blood.

1246
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:18,380
Ricky, I'm dying.

1247
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:19,490
No, you're not dying.

1248
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,060
I'm going to die.

1249
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:22,460
You're not going to die.

1250
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:27,610
All right, all right, press here, Kid.

1251
01:16:27,820 --> 01:16:28,700
Hard.

1252
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:30,370
I'll call a doctor.

1253
01:16:30,940 --> 01:16:32,740
You're going to be fine.

1254
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:40,540
It's all right, Ricky.

1255
01:16:40,940 --> 01:16:41,740
It's all right.

1256
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:43,260
Listen, Kid.

1257
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:45,300
Chino is coming.

1258
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:48,460
He'll give us a shit load of money for that girl.

1259
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:51,170
When we have the money we'll get out of here.

1260
01:16:52,220 --> 01:16:53,740
Go far away.

1261
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:58,920
It's me, Princess.

1262
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:00,320
Hi, Princess.

1263
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:02,000
I'm having my operation.

1264
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,550
Begginers luck.

1265
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:10,480
Just a minute, please.

1266
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:14,320
They're poing to knock me out and I'm here chatting away.

1267
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,350
I'd like you to come,

1268
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:17,920
so I'm not alone.

1269
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:21,840
I know this is just like cut and paste,

1270
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:24,800
but I'm still kind of scared.

1271
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,640
Please, let me go home.

1272
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:33,120
Don't hurt me, let me go home.

1273
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:34,840
Laugh a little bit, honey.

1274
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:37,760
Life's sad enough without you looking like a wreck.

1275
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:40,040
My father's a policeman.

1276
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:42,200
A policeman?

1277
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:45,960
That's perfect for me.

1278
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:47,760
Go on.

1279
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,600
Take this gadget

1280
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:51,950
and call your father.

1281
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:53,520
Dial the numbers.

1282
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,800
Dad, it's Veronica!

1283
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:00,920
It's Veronica! Dad!

1284
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:01,920
Hang on.

1285
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:04,480
Listen, we "did a kidnap" on your daughter.

1286
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,070
I should get at least 20 years.

1287
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,030
In jail.

1288
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:09,040
What?

1289
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:10,600
He says I'm nuts.

1290
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:13,440
If you want to see her, you have to come here.

1291
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:14,720
No police, nothing.

1292
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:16,400
You have to arrest me.

1293
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:19,600
Hold the line a minute, I'll give you the address.

1294
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:21,910
Wait.

1295
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:23,440
Hon, you know where this place is?

1296
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:37,070
Give me a fucking break.

1297
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:40,840
Where are the bandages?

1298
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,790
They were here. Where are they?

1299
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:46,520
You're always moving my shit around.

1300
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:49,560
I had my bag of bandages here. Where is it?

1301
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:51,400
Where is it?

1302
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:52,720
I'm leaving.

1303
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:55,160
You're not going anywhere. Look at me.

1304
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,160
You're not going anywhere.

1305
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:00,200
You don't fool me with your tough guy act.

1306
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,790
Thank God, you're not Angelito.

1307
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:06,870
I think that what you need is affection.

1308
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,680
But you have to work at it.

1309
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:13,430
It's easy to give up when you've been knocked down twice.

1310
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:16,880
I'm telling you this

1311
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:18,680
because I'm like you.

1312
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:20,920
I go along with people

1313
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:24,710
and I don't see that they're screwing up my life.

1314
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:29,600
And life's too short, Ricky. It's too short.

1315
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:33,280
Scrag...

1316
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:38,160
My name isn't Scrag.

1317
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:41,880
It's Soledad.

1318
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:48,710
100,000, right?

1319
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:06,000
The girl, please.

1320
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:16,360
You surprised me.

1321
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,520
You anticipated your opponent's move.

1322
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,830
You deserve this money. Take it.

1323
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:27,480
A lot of blood.

1324
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:30,590
Did you have to sacrifice a pawn?

1325
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:40,240
Up the stairs.

1326
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:42,590
At the end of the corridor.

1327
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:44,960
Wait.

1328
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:48,440
What are you going to do?

1329
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:50,800
You know.

1330
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,720
Are you going to try to stop me?

1331
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,430
You won't do anything. You know why?

1332
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,160
You've taken the money.

1333
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,880
Now we're both on the same side.

1334
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:13,080
Come on, we have to go.

1335
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,160
We both have to go,

1336
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:16,190
together.

1337
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:17,480
0K?

1338
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:19,080
Where could we go?

1339
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,150
You go on.

1340
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:24,440
If the police come it's gonna be a mess.

1341
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:26,390
I'm going to the toilet.

1342
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:29,760
- Pregnant women piss all day. - You're not pregnant.

1343
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:31,520
How do you know?

1344
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:34,400
I was pregnant once and it was just like this.

1345
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,240
- You were pregnant? - Yes.

1346
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:38,550
And what happened?

1347
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:40,910
Awful.

1348
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,120
The priests made me abort.

1349
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:44,990
Just as well.

1350
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:48,720
Imagine a child on the street all day with a whore for a mother.

1351
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:51,120
That scars you forever.

1352
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:54,640
The best thing for that child

1353
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:56,310
was not to be born.

1354
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:04,710
Mom, look at me.

1355
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:06,710
Look at me.

1356
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:10,680
I'm Ricky.

1357
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:14,510
Ricky, your child.

1358
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:16,440
Your son.

1359
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,120
Mom, I'm Ricky, your child.

1360
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:21,710
Really, I'm so sorry.

1361
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:24,720
I can't remember.

1362
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,280
You abandoned me.

1363
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:33,350
You dumped me on the street when I was 12.

1364
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:38,320
Maybe your head doesn't want to remember, but you fucked me up.

1365
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:41,760
I think you do remember.

1366
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:47,630
What's that?

1367
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,070
That's me.

1368
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:51,750
And that's me.

1369
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:55,680
You can't fool me. You're lying.

1370
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:57,920
- That's me. - You're lying to me.

1371
01:23:58,440 --> 01:23:59,720
That's me, mom.

1372
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:02,360
It's not true.

1373
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:04,480
What the hell are you doing?

1374
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:07,160
Why are you tearing up the photo?

1375
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:08,840
- Mom... - Don't call me mom!

1376
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,000
I'm not your mother!

1377
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:15,230
I'm going to pee. When I come back I don't want to see you here.

1378
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:19,360
I've called the police to take me to jail. That's where I should be.

1379
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:39,960
- You... - Take it easy.

1380
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:42,150
Where's my daughter?

1381
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:44,790
Where's my daughter?

1382
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,230
Tell me now.

1383
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,480
Don't move! You hear me?

1384
01:24:58,920 --> 01:24:59,880
Hey, you!

1385
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:01,310
Where's my daughter?

1386
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:02,840
Where's my daughter?

1387
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:15,640
Where is she, bitch?

1388
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:17,070
Where's my daughter?

1389
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:26,920
Will you tell me now? Where is she?

1390
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:29,400
Upstairs?

1391
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:56,510
Dad...

1392
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,360
Santos,

1393
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:02,080
I knew you wouldn't want to miss this.

1394
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,240
Let her go.

1395
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:06,480
You going to shoot me?

1396
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:10,310
Go on, try it.

1397
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:11,710
Shoot.

1398
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:13,750
Let her go.

1399
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:18,920
If you're very lucky,

1400
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:20,840
you might hit me.

1401
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:23,840
But I won't miss.

1402
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:26,840
Fire.

1403
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:29,470
You won't fire?

1404
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:32,000
Then drop your gun.

1405
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:34,510
Drop it.

1406
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:36,520
Don't worry, love.

1407
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:49,800
I told you to drop your gun.

1408
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:05,710
You tortured and killed my son.

1409
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:12,630
I didn't do anything.

1410
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:14,990
I swear.

1411
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:17,670
What did you do with his body?

1412
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:23,520
At least have the decency to tell me what you did with his body.

1413
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:28,510
0r are you ashamed to tell me in front of your daughter?

1414
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:37,190
She's a child.

1415
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:40,270
She's not to blame.

1416
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:42,310
Children are innocent.

1417
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:50,520
They shouldn't pay for their fathers' sins.

1418
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:53,910
It's not fair.

1419
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:58,240
But who said the world was fair?

1420
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:16,720
She can't hear you now.

1421
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:17,830
Talk.

1422
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:34,030
We didn't know it was your son.

1423
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:38,800
When they called me and I got there and saw him,

1424
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:44,840
he was already dead.

1425
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:50,360
I had to protect my people.

1426
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,630
We took his body out to sea

1427
01:28:57,480 --> 01:28:58,520
and sank it.

1428
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:06,680
Now you'll see how I torture and kill your daughter.

1429
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:10,120
Don't look like that. You're lucky.

1430
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:14,880
The hope of seeing my son alive again destroyed me bit by bit.

1431
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,560
I'll destroy you in one go.

1432
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:30,640
What are you going to do?

1433
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:41,920
Tell me.

1434
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:44,190
What are you going to do?

1435
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:49,590
What?

1436
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:52,680
Don't worry, my love.

1437
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:22,720
They say

1438
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:25,560
that a split second before you die

1439
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:28,520
your whole life passes before your eyes.

1440
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:48,440
It's all a lie.

1441
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:51,510
You can only think of one thing.

1442
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:53,280
You think

1443
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:55,390
how lucky the living are,

1444
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:58,430
the ones still breathinp.

1445
01:32:29,700 --> 01:32:31,140
I want you awake.

1446
01:32:33,820 --> 01:32:35,260
Don't close your eyes.

1447
01:32:35,460 --> 01:32:37,260
Keep your eyes open!

1448
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:41,410
You know something?

1449
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:44,580
Maybe I won't go back to jail yet.

1450
01:32:45,580 --> 01:32:47,700
The truth is, the food's crap.

1451
01:32:48,620 --> 01:32:50,930
And things haven't gone so badly for us.

1452
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:00,770
Mom...

1453
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:03,500
Mom...

1454
01:33:08,140 --> 01:33:09,180
Mom...

1455
01:33:11,060 --> 01:33:11,970
What?
