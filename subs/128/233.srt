1
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,983
Five years,

2
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:03,550
I remember when I couldn't get five days,

3
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,431
What's your name?

4
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,769
Hey, Adam, Sex addict,

5
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,071
-Hi, Adam,
-Hi, Adam,

6
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:31,579
I never want to get cocky about this,
you know?

7
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,846
I never want to be, Iike, "Yo, Iook at me.

8
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,980
"I got it all. I got five years.
I got it all figured out."

9
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:38,819
I've had to make it a practice,

10
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:44,694
I have to remind myself every day
where this disease could take me,

11
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:54,939
I have to remember jonesing, feeling Iike
I was gonna fucking die if I didn't have sex.

12
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,606
I've got to be vigilant, you know? I can't...

13
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:02,204
I can't be easy with myself in this program.

14
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,556
So, yeah,

15
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,457
I am grateful to be sober today,

16
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,517
Thanks,

17
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,461
Thanks for Ietting me share.

18
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:52,831
What are you doing?

19
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,131
Hey, I'm Neil. I'm a sexy...

20
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,033
I'm a sex addict.

21
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,833
-Hi, Neil.
-Hi, Neil.

22
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,900
Thanks so much for your share, Adam.
That's some powerful shit, man. Damn.

23
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,605
AII right, so Iet me check in.

24
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:09,310
How am I doing?

25
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:13,208
You know, I'm good, actually.

26
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,316
I'm feeling pretty good.

27
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:18,414
Work's good. Work's great.

28
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:20,390
AII right, what do we got?

29
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,690
Twenty-something male
presenting polysubstance OD.

30
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,196
We gave him the Narcan, then he woke up,
starting pulling everything,

31
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,493
-and then went out again.
-Got it.

32
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,392
Sir? Can you hear me?

33
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,530
Can you tell me your name, bud?

34
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,867
AII right, belly's distended.

35
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,931
Let's get an IV set up
and then put a Foley in.

36
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,408
Put it in what?

37
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,869
Damn.

38
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,881
Looks Iike a bird egg in a nest.

39
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,777
Poor guy probably
needs a squirrel to jerk him off.

40
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:46,944
Don't you think?

41
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,750
It kind of Iooks Iike an elevator button.

42
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,813
Third floor. Beep.

43
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:55,553
Dr. Garalla?

44
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,392
Can I see you over here
for a second, please?

45
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,590
You know, but I gotta say it's working,
Totally working,

46
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:07,530
I haven't touched myself in about a month,
which is crazy,

47
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:12,635
'cause I remember, you know, when
I first heard about the no masturbation rule,

48
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:16,671
I was, Iike,
"Okay, should I not breathe while I'm at it?"

49
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:19,209
Should I not breathe while I'm at it?

50
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:22,580
AII right, well, that wraps it up.

51
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,256
Thanks for Ietting me share.

52
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:26,981
Yeah.

53
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:30,624
Thanks. I'm Mike,
gratefully recovering sex addict.

54
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:31,959
-Hi, Mike.
-Hi, Mike.

55
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,556
I'm proud of you, birthday boy.

56
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:35,692
-Really proud.
-Thanks.

57
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,463
And I'm proud to be your sponsor.

58
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,871
So, what's going on with me? Let's see,

59
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:45,642
Well, I'm grateful to be sober,

60
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:51,984
Been taking
some visual drinks on the streets,

61
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:57,321
Is it me, or is Manhattan
just one big fucking catwalk?

62
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:00,824
Hey.

63
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,918
Hey.

64
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:09,733
I'm really embarrassed to say this,
but I forgot your name.

65
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:15,698
You guys have heard me say this before.
This disease is a fucking bitch.

66
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:21,746
Now I have been sober
15 years in the beverage program.

67
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,372
No problem.

68
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,748
This thing is a whole different animal.

69
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:32,114
It's Iike trying to quit crack
while the pipe's attached to your body.

70
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:40,423
Who serves stale bread?
It's completely stale.

71
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,594
-Have you decided yet?
-Yeah, just one moment.

72
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:45,296
What's tempeh again?

73
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:48,499
-Just order the pancakes, Mike.
-Maybe I want to try something different.

74
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:53,910
You know what you should get?
It's the salmon scramble. It's so good.

75
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,609
This time I'm going to go for the

76
00:06:58,718 --> 00:06:59,946
pancakes.

77
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,152
Get off my back.

78
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,619
How's work?

79
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,029
It's pretty good.
We just Ianded the postal service.

80
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,086
What?

81
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,360
Yup, we're going to be
helping them green all their packaging.

82
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,992
-That's huge. The postal service.
-Right. Yeah.

83
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:19,697
That's an oxymoron, right?
The postal service.

84
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:24,471
It's Iike jumbo shrimp
or military intelligence.

85
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:28,104
No. It's actually not an oxymoron at all.

86
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:31,411
They actually deliver the mail.
Postal service.

87
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:34,078
-But the...
-See, there's no... There's actually no...

88
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:37,987
-No, but there is. They're having issues.
-Not at all. Not an oxymoron.

89
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,525
So how's the dating?

90
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,724
-What?
-It's...

91
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,933
Come on, you got five years. It's time.

92
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,733
The point isn't to Iive Iike a monk.

93
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:57,342
-It's easy to be skinny on a desert island.
-I know. I know. I know.

94
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,878
It's not Iike booze or drugs.
You don't have to shut it off completely.

95
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:00,970
Jesus, I'II start dating.

96
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,379
-Don't just say that to shut me up.
-What do you want me to say?

97
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:04,847
I don't want you to say anything.
I want you to do.

98
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,475
-Okay, fine. I'II do it.
-Do. Date.

99
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:07,917
-You are?
-Yes. I'm doing it.

100
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,011
Yeah? Good.

101
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,749
Why couldn't I have
picked an easy sponsor?

102
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,381
-Why?
-I don't know. Maybe you wanted to recover.

103
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,392
Why are you riding me?

104
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,953
Here. This is for you.

105
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,064
-Subtle.
-If you want to bust my balls...

106
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:26,263
No! No, no, no! I Iove it!
Are you kidding me?

107
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,364
I always wanted
one of your touchy-feely rocks.

108
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,432
I want one. I want a touchy-feely rock, too.

109
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,738
So fucking earn it.

110
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:41,918
So I'm going to hear
your first step after this, right?

111
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,745
Oh, shit.

112
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:45,145
Neil.

113
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:47,590
Dude, I've been working on it all week.

114
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,560
I totally, totally forgot
that we were doing that today.

115
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:52,291
You do remember
why you're in this program, right?

116
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:55,528
-Free bagels?
-You were court ordered.

117
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,627
-Frottage.
-I know.

118
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,696
-Unconsensual touching of other people.
-I know.

119
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,402
Listen, Neil, you gotta do the work.

120
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,308
You have to do whatever it takes.

121
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,405
You think I Iike
not having a television or a Iaptop?

122
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:13,077
It fucking blows. But guess what?
It's saving my Iife, so I do it.

123
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:17,521
-Is any of this of interest to you, Neil?
-Yes, it's all of interest to me.

124
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,081
Can we please move on?
I'II get it done this week. Thank you.

125
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,154
What happened to your face?

126
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,763
Nothing.

127
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,072
My fellow gastronauts.

128
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:26,550
I bring you good tidings and good eatings.

129
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,649
Let's bug out.

130
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:47,199
No, Pinocch, don't do it!
It's me, Jiminy. Put the stick down!

131
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:52,108
Well, you should have thought about that
before you ratted me out to Geppetto.

132
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,875
That's not my real voice.

133
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,213
Well, then sorry, I'm...

134
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:01,912
No! Come back! I'm Adam.

135
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:04,080
-I'm Phoebe.
-Hi, Phoebe.

136
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,124
You are a very cruel man, Adam.

137
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:10,285
Believe me,
it hurts them far more than it hurts me.

138
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:12,630
Don't you mean that the other way around?

139
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:14,824
No, Phoebe, I don't.

140
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,460
So what you making?

141
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,736
-FIip phone, huh?
-Yeah.

142
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,572
You ever carbon dated this thing?

143
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,748
What are you doing?

144
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,548
Don't be so slow, Pinocchio.

145
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,107
Mike.

146
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,983
Mike, there's someone downstairs.

147
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,313
What?

148
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:45,150
There's someone downstairs. Get up.

149
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:10,773
Dad! It's me.

150
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,043
Danny?

151
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:13,942
I used the Hide-a-Key.

152
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:18,351
-What the fuck are you doing here?
-I wanted to come see you guys.

153
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:22,625
So you just decided
you'd stop by for a midnight chat?

154
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:24,789
I've been driving all day.
I didn't have a chance...

155
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,126
So you're hungry.

156
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,928
So you figured
you'd eat our food and then rob us.

157
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:35,271
I'm not going to rob you, Dad.
I haven't used in eight months.

158
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:36,672
Yeah, right.

159
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,943
I wouldn't believe me either,
I guess, but it's true.

160
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:43,479
You know how I know an addict is Iying?

161
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:45,750
His Iips are moving.

162
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,245
Mom up there?

163
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,485
She's sleeping.

164
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,023
Danny?

165
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,858
Hey, Mom.

166
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,186
Danny!

167
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:01,530
Hey.

168
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:07,199
Oh, my...

169
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,802
Look at you!

170
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:17,947
Kid's stolen money,
sports equipment, his mom's necklace.

171
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,983
Never once said he's sorry.

172
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:25,915
You know, I've tried to get him in the rooms.

173
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,755
And you know what they say,

174
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:32,354
"This is a program for people that want it,
not for people who need it."

175
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:40,165
Hi. Dede. New to the program.

176
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:42,030
-Hi, Dede.
-Hi, Dede.

177
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,372
There's a Iot of dudes in here.

178
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:50,346
Sorry, my other program
isn't such a sausage fest.

179
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:59,117
My NA sponsor said I needed
to come here because...

180
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,320
"Tell the truth and tell it fast."

181
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:06,191
The only way
I know how to relate to men is sex.

182
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:09,133
It's been that way forever.

183
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:14,238
I can remember my mom screaming at me

184
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,867
for grinding on my cousin
when I was, Iike, four years old.

185
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,539
I took my neighbor's virginity by force
when I was 12,

186
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:27,444
seduced my high school English teacher,
got him fired when he tried to break it off.

187
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,410
My 20s,

188
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:35,555
two abortions,
one Iong game of musical fuck chairs.

189
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:43,259
So now I'm 30, single, no dude, no kids.

190
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:51,975
And I just Iost my best friend in the
whole world because I fucked her old man.

191
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,746
I didn't even Iike the douchebag.

192
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,549
But that's what I do.

193
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,349
There's gotta be another way.

194
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,930
There has to be,
or I'm gonna fucking kill myself.

195
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:20,299
So that's what I got.

196
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:22,997
Thanks.

197
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:25,372
-Keep coming back.
-Keep coming back.

198
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,080
At this meeting, we give out chips

199
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:32,845
to recognize and celebrate sexual sobriety
and to help us in our recovery.

200
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:35,284
We have found through
our experience that sobriety

201
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:39,222
includes freedom from masturbation
and sex outside of a committed relationship.

202
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,959
Is anybody celebrating 30 days?

203
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,170
Good for you. Good going.

204
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,973
Anybody else, 30 days?

205
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,311
AII right, all right!

206
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:14,014
Anybody else? Anybody else? Thirty days?

207
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:19,527
Hey, Friar Tuck. What's going on?

208
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:22,190
Friar Tuck is going on a date.

209
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,201
-Yeah.
-Way to go!

210
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:29,672
Well, so what are we talking?
Male, female or shemale?

211
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:32,301
Hey, babe, you told me to get out there.

212
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:36,338
Well, I'm proud of you.
That's good news. That's good news.

213
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,281
-You going to fellowship?
-No, I can't.

214
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:42,809
I'm meeting up with my sponsee
to go over his first step.

215
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,048
Who, Shecky Greene?

216
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:50,628
So Iet's get started. Got your book?

217
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:55,097
Yeah, my book.
So here's the deal. I didn't really get to...

218
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:57,032
It's okay. Just Iet me see it.

219
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,865
I'm operating on, Iike, four hours of sleep.

220
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:01,201
It's fine. We'II just... We'II get it.
We'II get started.

221
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:04,140
I just...
I would have Iiked a Iittle bit more time.

222
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,574
Is this it?

223
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,946
I didn't get a chance
to do what I wanted to do.

224
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:11,509
So, no.

225
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,175
I'm gonna have a Iot more time
this week to work on it.

226
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:16,915
-No, man. This isn't gonna work for me. No.
-What do you want?

227
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:22,225
Look, you're wasting my time.
This is a complete waste of my time.

228
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,625
I'm sorry, I can't do this.
I can't work with you.

229
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,721
Take it. Take the book.

230
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:28,732
You can't... What, are you dropping me?

231
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,099
I am sorry. What else...
What other choice do I have, really?

232
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,140
I just got a 30-day chip in there,
and you're firing me?

233
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:37,698
-Neil...
-No, that is all sorts of fucked up, man.

234
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:41,177
Neil, I told you from the beginning
that you had to do the work.

235
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:43,373
You haven't done
a single thing in this book.

236
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:44,938
-Try doing my job.
-What are you talking about?

237
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,315
-This is bullshit.
-Are you out ofyour mind?

238
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,183
I need this, okay?

239
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,356
I need you to sign my court card.

240
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:56,122
-There it is. That's what this is about?
-That's not what this is about.

241
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,164
Don't worry, Neil.
The chairperson can sign your card.

242
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:01,722
You don't need me and I don't need this.

243
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:13,777
The pages are all stuck fucking together.
If it wasn't you, then who?

244
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:21,246
Who the fuck brought my book outside?
Who the fuck Ieft my book outside?

245
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:22,786
Who?

246
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:24,382
Who?

247
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,251
Just tell me who.

248
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,624
If it wasn't you, then who?

249
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:30,992
Who?

250
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:34,192
-Who? You know what...
-Shut the fuck up!

251
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,465
Asshole.

252
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,298
What's all this?

253
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:43,766
Danny's making us breakfast.

254
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,804
This will be interesting.

255
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:51,175
I have not seen my son in years.
Can you try not chasing him away?

256
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,479
Here we go.

257
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,313
Breakfast a Ia Danny.

258
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:00,688
Look at this. It's so fancy.

259
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,086
What's this gonna cost us?

260
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:07,964
-Nothing.
-Okay.

261
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,625
There's some butter there if you want it, Ma.

262
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:11,328
Thank you.

263
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,701
This is really good.

264
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,607
I tried to get yours back, but...

265
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:26,616
-Oh, honey.
-It's the best I could do.

266
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:36,292
-Will you put it on me?
-Yeah, of course.

267
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:42,926
So, yeah, I mean,
after my stretch, I bounced around a Iot.

268
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:48,438
I worked an oil rig off the Gulf of Mexico,
picked spinach in Central Valley, California.

269
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:51,635
-Really?
-Yeah. Just basically saw the country.

270
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,542
And you've been sober the whole time?

271
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,444
Yeah.

272
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:58,413
Just white-knuckling it?

273
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,548
Yeah, you know,
not everybody needs to go with AA, Dad.

274
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:06,782
Is that right?

275
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:11,092
Yeah, some people
don't need a group to Iean on.

276
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,653
Some people can do it on their own.

277
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,597
Hasn't been my experience.

278
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,504
-You want more coffee?
-Yes, please.

279
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:27,310
What?

280
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:43,856
Hey.

281
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,863
-Hello.
-Hello.

282
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:54,635
If I knew we were gonna be racing,
I would have worn my Livestrong bracelet.

283
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:57,642
You know,
this actually might be a good time

284
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:01,543
to tell you that
I had breast cancer five years ago.

285
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,476
Oh, God, really?

286
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:07,751
Yeah.

287
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:14,287
-That's a tough break. I'm sorry.
-Yeah, it was.

288
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:18,090
But it's fine. I'm fine now, so...

289
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:20,063
I'm glad to hear that.

290
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:25,334
So I see you're perspiring a tad.

291
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,895
I just ran a 10K.

292
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:33,539
Okay, my initial reaction is to say,
"Well, I just ran a marathon."

293
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:36,103
But I can't tell
if you're joking or if you're serious.

294
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:38,149
I'm as serious as cancer.

295
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,643
Wait, you just ran a 10K?

296
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:45,447
I'm training for the New York Triathlon.

297
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:54,757
Okay, we need a system here,
some signs to signify.

298
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,892
So when we're serious, we have to do this.

299
00:23:56,968 --> 00:24:01,462
I Iove that. Okay. Yes, Adam, I'm serious.
I'm training for a triathlon.

300
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,998
Okay.
Okay, you seriously scare/impress me.

301
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:06,134
Thank you.

302
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:09,873
And when we're joking, we can do that.

303
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:12,510
Did you just pay homage to The Sting?

304
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:15,475
-My God, you're hot.
-No, you're hot.

305
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:19,751
What? No, you are. You're actually very hot.

306
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,850
-Thanks.
-You're extremely hot.

307
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:28,089
-Let's do this.
-Okay.

308
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:32,762
I'm just getting warmed up here.
I'm ready to go now.

309
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:45,312
How you doing back there?

310
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:48,113
I'm fine. I'm just drafting.

311
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:49,448
Okay.

312
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:12,000
Doctor.

313
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:16,135
-Can I talk to you for a second?
-Sure.

314
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,475
Yeah, you know, I just...

315
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:23,885
I really wanted to apologize for all the joking
around and stuff that I do around here.

316
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:29,291
You know, I think it's really,
to be honest, Iike, a defense mechanism.

317
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:32,725
You know, for all the pressures
we have here as doctors.

318
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:35,061
Thank you. Thank you, that's good to hear.

319
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:37,531
I think it's also a...

320
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:41,038
I think it's also
kind of a product of my childhood.

321
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:42,571
My mom, God bless her,

322
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:47,135
she's still alive, but, you know, she was
really sick a Iot when I was growing up.

323
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,907
She had IBS, bad,

324
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:53,314
and the only thing that really made her feel
better was when I would make her Iaugh.

325
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,149
Apology accepted, okay?
Now if you'II excuse me...

326
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,458
Wait...

327
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:16,070
So I think we can go ahead
and untuck that now.

328
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:19,042
But that's part of my intended ensemble.

329
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,874
Okay. And then I'II tuck it back in.

330
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:23,708
Nice re-tucking.

331
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:27,107
Would you care for a Iittle GU?

332
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,780
Goo?

333
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:32,452
I'm new to goo. I...

334
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,354
Oh, dear.

335
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,294
You kind of got some on your face there.

336
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:43,891
-Did I get it?
-Lower. Lower.

337
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:46,301
-It's still there?
-Nope. It's on your chin.

338
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:47,804
My shin?

339
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:49,973
It's on your chin.

340
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,236
My chin. Which one?

341
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:55,876
Just... Right...

342
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,574
-That...
-Right there.

343
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:24,466
-I think I need a drink.
-I think I need one, too.

344
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:28,168
Wait, you're not an alcoholic, are you?

345
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,747
-No. Why?
-Okay.

346
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:34,413
No, because
my Iast boyfriend was an alcoholic,

347
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,250
and I promised myself
I'd never date an addict again.

348
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:44,855
Well, I'm not an alcoholic.

349
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,195
Great.

350
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:58,598
So my son got really upset the other day

351
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,737
'cause I told him he had to
stop playing and do his homework.

352
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:04,140
And I understand how he feels,

353
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:07,616
but I couldn't say to him,
Iike, you know, "Don't you think

354
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:11,679
"I'd rather be alone with a jar of blow
and a couple of transsexual hookers?"

355
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,051
Not that he would know...

356
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:20,256
I mean, he doesn't know
what the word "jar" means, but...

357
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:25,263
Neil.

358
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,540
Hey. Neil. Sex addict.

359
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:30,938
-Hi, Neil.
-Hi, Neil.

360
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:32,169
Hey.

361
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:38,446
I dreamed of being a doctor
since I was 10 years old.

362
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:41,582
It all started with ER,

363
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:45,987
I knew I could never be George CIooney,
but Anthony Edwards...

364
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:51,493
Bald, glasses, saving Iives Iike a superhero,
that I could do.

365
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:59,566
So I worked nonstop for many years
with no social Iife, and I finally did it.

366
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,597
I became a doctor.

367
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:06,037
I was really good at it, too.

368
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:12,149
Until I got fired yesterday
for filming up my boss' skirt.

369
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:18,911
I told her it was for a documentary called
What the Ground Sees,

370
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,952
Oddly enough, she didn't buy it.

371
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:26,389
Stop fucking around, asshole!

372
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:32,799
It's not funny anymore, is it? Nope.

373
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:40,335
I've been Iying about my day count
this entire time.

374
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:44,281
I've never actually even gotten one day.

375
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:50,319
I can't Iie anymore.

376
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,822
Not to you, not to myself.

377
00:29:57,595 --> 00:30:01,964
So from now on, no more bullshit.

378
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,599
Just the truth.

379
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,133
And the truth is...

380
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:15,976
I'm out of control.

381
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:20,479
I'm scared.

382
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,751
And I need help.

383
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,659
I need help.

384
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:34,060
Okay, Neil, if we're gonna do this again,
then you gotta give me 150%

385
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:35,121
Okay.

386
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,135
And since you're not working,
you have to do a 90 in 90.

387
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:40,433
-What is that?
-Ninety meetings in 90 days.

388
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,631
Okay.

389
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:43,105
-Call me every day.
-Fine.

390
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,573
You pray every day.

391
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:46,740
-I'm kind of an atheist.
-AII right.

392
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:50,747
Okay! AII right, fine.
Dude, I'II do whatever I gotta do.

393
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:51,871
Listen to me.

394
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:55,043
Higher power doesn't have to be some
old dude with a beard in the sky, okay?

395
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,882
It just has to be something
that's bigger than you.

396
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:58,352
I'm pretty big.

397
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:00,789
-And no more Iame jokes, all right?
-Okay.

398
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,487
-Stop that shit.
-Okay.

399
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:04,789
No subway, no Internet.

400
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:08,162
-Are you fucking serious, dude?
-I am serious, are you?

401
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:09,495
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

402
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:11,000
-No. No worries.
-Not a problem.

403
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:14,698
-I can... I'II talk to you Iater.
-We'II talk and I'II... You can call me.

404
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:18,299
-That was a stupid share, dude.
-Thanks.

405
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:21,743
I Iove when people just bring it.

406
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:24,111
It was...
You were, Iike, an open wound out there.

407
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:27,879
It was... Your guts
were flopping out all over the place.

408
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:28,976
Thanks.

409
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,749
-That was some inspiring shit, yo.
-Yeah.

410
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:32,812
I'm Dede.

411
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,587
-I know who you are.
-Can I get your number?

412
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:39,357
My sponsor told me to get numbers,
but I'm not good at that reaching out shit.

413
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,522
It's...

414
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:43,698
-You ready?
-Yeah. Okay.

415
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:46,599
-6-4-6.
-Okay.

416
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,696
-5-5-5.
-Yeah.

417
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:52,038
Zero-uno-cuatro-niner,

418
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:56,547
646-555-01 49.

419
00:31:57,148 --> 00:32:00,709
Dude, you're a doorbell. Ding dong.

420
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:04,585
-I'm gonna call you.
-I'm gonna friggin' answer.

421
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:07,056
How's it going with the girl?

422
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:10,561
-Good. We had our first date.
-Nice.

423
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,185
Is she a friend of Bill?

424
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:16,359
No, she's a civilian.
She's great, she's funny, she's smart.

425
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,561
And you're a shallow prick,
so she must be gorgeous.

426
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:23,607
No, man, at this point in my sobriety,
I don't even notice the externals of a woman.

427
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,142
Yeah, fuck you, Deepak.

428
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:27,177
I'm just focused
right in on her heart and soul.

429
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:28,542
-Yeah, right.
-I swear.

430
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,637
Yeah.

431
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:32,274
You know if it keeps going well,
you got to tell her, right?

432
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,544
-Yeah.
-Full disclosure.

433
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,381
I'm a Iittle worried about that.

434
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:38,251
Well, worry is just a meditation on shit.

435
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,169
Good morning.

436
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:05,181
Morning.

437
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:06,777
So...

438
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:10,185
What the fuck, Danny?

439
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:12,146
Building you guys a koi pond.

440
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:14,322
Koi pond?

441
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:15,683
Yeah.

442
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,493
Thought it would go good with the whole,
you know, Zen vibe you guys got going on.

443
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:25,232
Just curious, you ever think about
running the idea by someone first?

444
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:27,965
Like, I don't know,
maybe the guy who owns the backyard?

445
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:31,074
Well, you know, I wanted it to be a surprise.

446
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,874
It is.

447
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:38,139
-So fish go in there?
-Yeah.

448
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:43,048
-You know, koi, those big orange carp.
-I know what koi are.

449
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:47,884
So what happens in the winter
when they freeze their Iittle koi nuts off?

450
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:50,694
No, Iook, I built one for a guy in Michigan.

451
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:53,731
You just poke a hole in the ice.
It's no problem.

452
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:54,787
You sure about that?

453
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:59,029
Trust me. You're gonna Iove it, Dad.

454
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,971
God.

455
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:33,468
Yeah, can I get someone to remove
this television from my room, please?

456
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:38,366
No, it's not broken.
I just don't want it here. Thanks.

457
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:48,081
Here you go.

458
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:49,813
-Did you block the...
-Yeah, boss.

459
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:52,651
You're all good. You're blocked.
So you want to go get dinner?

460
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:55,317
No, I've got to make a call.

461
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:00,359
Nice flourish,

462
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:03,062
Wait, what are you eating?

463
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,633
Just a Iittle healthy plate of veggies.

464
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:08,297
-Hold up your plate again,
-What?

465
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,963
I just want to see something.

466
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:17,577
Look at your cute Iittle plate with
your vegetables all segregated and such.

467
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:20,879
Yeah, I just don't think that
foods of different color should mix,

468
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:24,513
Hey, I hear you.
Separate but equal. Plessy v, Ferguson,

469
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:29,221
God, I really Iike you.
And I don't Iike anybody.

470
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,989
I know, right?
I hate everyone except for you.

471
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,223
Me, too,

472
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:38,601
I thought about you last night,

473
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:40,901
Yeah?

474
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:46,732
Actually, I thought about you three times.

475
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:52,974
Have you ever "thought" about me?

476
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:00,484
Hold on a second.

477
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:08,162
Yeah, Hey, come on in,

478
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:12,592
I unplugged it already,

479
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:16,402
Okay, Sorry about that,

480
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:18,567
Where did we leave off?

481
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:22,607
Are they taking the TV out of your room?

482
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,977
What?

483
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:25,572
What are you, Amish?

484
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:30,712
Yes, and I was hoping to
escort you to a barn raising upon my return,

485
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:36,349
Oh, my God, seriously, why
are they taking the TV out of your room?

486
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,596
I just can't have it in my room.

487
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:43,391
And why not?

488
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:47,436
You...

489
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,106
You know when you don't
have control over something?

490
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:56,306
No, I have control over everything in my life,

491
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:59,482
I'm kidding, I'm sorry, Go ahead,

492
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:01,847
Well...

493
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:09,886
I just...

494
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:12,862
I can't have any distractions
on these business trips.

495
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,529
Like me?

496
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,831
No. Like TV.

497
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:24,068
Hey, what's going on?

498
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:31,543
Owner said my seams suck.
Been sanding this shit for two days.

499
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:34,543
Welcome to residential construction.

500
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:36,980
Hey, I'm not complaining though.

501
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:40,421
I mean, I know
you're taking a flyer on me and all.

502
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:46,861
No, seriously, I just want to say how much
I appreciate what you're doing for me.

503
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,592
Hey. United, we stand. Divided, we stagger.

504
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,402
-It's just that...
-Hey, hey, hey.

505
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:57,202
Ever since I put the Iiquor down,

506
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:01,111
the slightest thing
makes me start crying Iike a Iittle bitch.

507
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:07,013
I get these feelings
coming up inside of me, you know?

508
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:09,717
Feelings are Iike children.

509
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:13,348
You don't want them driving the car, but you
don't want to stuff them in the trunk, either.

510
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:15,891
Where do you get this shit?

511
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,223
Meetings.

512
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:21,723
Lots and Iots and Iots of meetings.

513
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:36,772
-Hey, Mom. I'm kind of busy right now.
-That's funny,

514
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:40,544
I wasn't too busy
to give birth to you 28 years ago.

515
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:42,284
I'm sorry. How are you?

516
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:46,380
So Judy Berger's son, Howard,
is doing his premed at Tufts,

517
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:49,517
and he's thinking about
going into emergency medicine,

518
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:54,121
So I told her that you would take him around
one day next week, show him the ropes,

519
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:56,530
-No! I can't.
-Why not?

520
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,400
We're gearing up for our yearly reviews.
It's just a really bad time.

521
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:03,463
-Yeah, but I promised her, I promised her,
-Hang on, Mom.

522
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,304
-What? Code blue?
-She's counting on,,,

523
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:07,970
Get him into trauma room three stat!
I'II be right there!

524
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:09,603
I gotta go, Mom!

525
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:50,849
Hold on.

526
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:52,081
Hey, Neil.

527
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,750
Where have you been, man?
Dude, I'm Iosing it.

528
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:55,985
What's happening?

529
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,052
Everything in this goddamn city
makes me want to act out.

530
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:03,123
-Get to a meeting,
-Yeah, I am, I am. I'm going right now.

531
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,428
Good.

532
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,595
Neil, how are you getting there?

533
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,648
That's good.

534
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:46,465
Good to see you, brother.

535
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:00,213
It's Iooking good.

536
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:05,818
Can I get you some iced tea? Hungry?

537
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,993
Yeah. Tea sounds good.

538
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:09,726
David, what's up?

539
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:12,691
Oh, shit.

540
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:17,663
AII right. Well, don't get into it with him.
I'II be right there.

541
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:20,874
AII right. I'm sorry. Okay.

542
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:23,237
Guy on the job just slipped. I gotta go.

543
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:26,408
Come on, you guys are having fun.
Stay and finish.

544
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,452
It's all right, Ma.
If he's gotta go, he's gotta go.

545
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:31,016
He doesn't have to go. He wants to go.

546
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:34,114
Don't make a thing of this, okay?

547
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:36,819
The guy's having a nervous breakdown.

548
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:40,927
You wanna go with me?

549
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,300
Chuck!

550
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,804
Put this down.
Put that down! Put that down!

551
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:53,742
Thinks he can talk to me Iike that? Fuck you!

552
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:57,508
David, I'm sorry. He's off the job.
This is coming out of my pocket.

553
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:58,673
Yeah, no shit it will.

554
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:01,149
-You got a new window now, bitch!
-Okay. AII right.

555
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:02,378
-Fuck you!
-Give me a hand here?

556
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,421
Look at me! Stop it!

557
00:42:05,589 --> 00:42:06,886
Stop it!

558
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:11,118
Hey. Look at me. We're gonna go now.

559
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:13,222
You okay to go?

560
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,390
You okay to go?

561
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,865
Yeah.

562
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:22,302
AII right, come on.

563
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,103
We're not gonna do anything stupid.
We're gonna walk out of here, okay?

564
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:26,164
Yeah.

565
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:29,940
AII right? Look at me.
We're gonna do this, all right?

566
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:18,455
Now he's all right?

567
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,228
Yeah.

568
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,164
Sorry I've been a shitty son, Dad.

569
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:35,978
Sorry for all the Iying and the stealing...

570
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:40,280
The worry and all the bullshit.

571
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,377
I don't...

572
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:48,223
I don't want to disappoint you
anymore, Pop.

573
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,929
I want you to be proud of me.

574
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:04,003
Hey.

575
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:06,267
Jesus, you're beautiful.

576
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,211
What time is our reservation?

577
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:11,843
About a half an hour.

578
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:14,150
PIenty of time.

579
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,140
Yes, my tits are fake.

580
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:40,571
That's what happens
when your real ones try to kill you.

581
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:43,439
Is that what they mean by a booby prize?

582
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:09,204
I have been wanting to do that
since the bug party.

583
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:11,137
Oh, God. Me, too.

584
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:16,308
I'm really sorry for my brevity.

585
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:20,805
-It's just been a really Iong time for me.
-Yeah, right.

586
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:25,548
A gorgeous, single hetero
with a job in Manhattan?

587
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:29,057
No, I'm serious. It's been really Iong.

588
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:33,088
Hey.

589
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:36,360
Will you go with me?

590
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:38,157
Where?

591
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:41,227
You know, Iike, exclusively? You and me?

592
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:44,735
Yeah.

593
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:46,367
Totally.

594
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:47,603
-Really?
-Yeah.

595
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:49,543
That's awesome.

596
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,475
No, our reservation.

597
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:56,610
It's fine. We still have, Iike, 28 minutes.

598
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:57,077
Hey.

599
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:05,714
Is that a sobriety medallion?

600
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:19,799
Yeah.

601
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,740
I had been in recovery for five years.

602
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:27,037
For what?

603
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:32,882
Sex addiction.

604
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:36,380
What?

605
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,656
I'm sorry. I know I should have told you.
I've been meaning to tell you for a Iong time.

606
00:47:40,724 --> 00:47:42,316
Is that even a thing? Is that Iike...

607
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:46,021
Isn't that something that guys just say as
an excuse when they get caught cheating?

608
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:49,463
No. No. It's not an excuse, it's a disease.

609
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:56,968
I don't understand
why you didn't just tell me.

610
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,371
I don't understand.

611
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:00,740
I told you right away that I had had cancer.

612
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:03,803
-Why didn't you tell me?
-It's different. There's a stigma.

613
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,405
There's no stigma to cancer?

614
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:09,043
Cancer gets you sympathy.
My thing gets you judgment.

615
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,614
Okay, do you remember
when on our first date, when you said to me

616
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:16,454
that you couldn't date another addict
and you wouldn't date another addict?

617
00:48:17,427 --> 00:48:20,919
So there I am, I'm having a great time
with a woman that I really Iike,

618
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:23,489
and I'm thinking, "Fuck!

619
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:27,895
"I don't want this to be over
before it even gets to be started."

620
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:30,832
Phoebe, I'm sorry.

621
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,899
I should have told you sooner.
I know I should have.

622
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:38,505
But I'm telling you now, and I promise you
from now on, it'II be full disclosure, okay?

623
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,408
I just...

624
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:50,392
I need some time to just think about all this.

625
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:56,665
Okay, I understand.

626
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:03,973
Just get a pen, douchebag.

627
00:49:04,808 --> 00:49:07,800
Just get a fucking pen and a piece of paper.

628
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:10,574
Get a pen.

629
00:49:11,882 --> 00:49:13,782
-Get a pen.
-This guy...

630
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:17,251
Hey, pal! Take it inside, will you?
We're trying to meditate here.

631
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:19,721
-Yeah? Fuck you!
-What'd you say?

632
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,691
Why don't you come over the fence?
I'II shove that fucking thing up your ass!

633
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:24,158
Take it inside!

634
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:34,262
What?

635
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:39,002
I was just remembering how when you
were a kid, you used to Iove to wrestle me.

636
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:40,806
Yeah.

637
00:49:40,877 --> 00:49:43,505
Cute Iittle honey badger hanging on my Ieg.

638
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:48,546
You used to pin me in,
Iike, one move every damn time.

639
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:50,609
Yeah, I could probably still do that.

640
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:53,520
Maybe... I don't know,
maybe take me two, three moves.

641
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:55,285
-Yeah? You think so? Two or three?
-You know, I'm...

642
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:56,951
-Well, I'm getting old. So...
-Yeah.

643
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:59,086
-I can't do the one anymore.
-Yeah, all right.

644
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:03,433
You motherfucker!

645
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:07,369
Shit! You're big!

646
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:13,698
Shit.

647
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,277
-You okay?
-Fuck.

648
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:17,346
-You all right?
-My God.

649
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:23,545
One! Two!

650
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,678
--Three!
-AII right, all right, all right.

651
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:28,418
Winner and still champion!

652
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:30,619
You fucking sandbagged me.
That's bullshit.

653
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,559
I'm too fast. I'm too pretty.

654
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,926
AII right, that's it. Round two, Iet's go.
You're going down, old man.

655
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:38,325
-Come on.
-Shit.

656
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:40,626
-You got a phone call.
-Yeah.

657
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:44,062
My sponsee.

658
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:46,303
Hey, Adam, what's up?

659
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:51,007
Let me go somewhere I can talk.

660
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:53,605
Rain check.

661
00:50:57,454 --> 00:51:01,254
It's just all so fucking complicated, man.
I just...

662
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:05,420
I really am feeling Iike just grabbing a fuck-it
bucket and going down in a blaze of glory.

663
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:08,123
-You know what I'm saying?
-Hold on. Hold on.

664
00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:10,024
Listen, Adam.

665
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:16,265
If I may, you have a slight tendency
to Iive in the, shall we say, extremes.

666
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:19,899
Look, Iife is gonna throw shit at you.

667
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:22,467
There's gonna be disappointments,
betrayals,

668
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:25,672
and I know it hurts
Iike a back alley colonoscopy.

669
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,616
But look,
whether it's this girl or the next girl,

670
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:34,185
you need to find someone
that accepts the whole you, warts and all.

671
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:39,661
Listen, I gave Katie Hep C,
and she stuck it out with my sorry ass.

672
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:43,027
You really are a Iucky son of a bitch.
You do know that, don't you?

673
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,097
I do know that.

674
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:47,295
And I'm grateful for it every day.

675
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:49,569
And you will be, too.

676
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,854
Yeah, hello?

677
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:52,766
Hey, Neil, it's Dede.
I met you the other day at the meeting.

678
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:56,001
-Yeah. Hey, how...
-Can you talk? Is this a bad time?

679
00:52:56,072 --> 00:53:00,941
No, no. Now's a good time.
What's going on?

680
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,844
My sponsor's not calling me back,
and I'm freaking the fuck out.

681
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:07,811
Okay, okay. Well, what's happening?

682
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:10,478
My ex just called, He wants me to come over,

683
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:17,551
The guy is a total Iying, toxic sack of shit,
but I really wanna go fuck him.

684
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:22,289
Well, you know, that's maybe not good.
That's not good, I think.

685
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:24,833
So Iet's just...

686
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:26,994
Let's talk this through.

687
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,362
AII right,
what would happen if you went over there?

688
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:32,202
It would be a shit show.

689
00:53:32,275 --> 00:53:35,506
Be specific now. What would happen?

690
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:38,439
I'd get inside and he'd attack me.

691
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:39,880
Right. And after that?

692
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:41,884
He'd rip my pants off
and start eating me out,

693
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:43,351
-Wait. What? What?
-'Cause that's his thing,

694
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,285
I mean, the guy's,
Iike, a fucking pussy fanatic.

695
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:46,913
No, after that, skipping ahead.

696
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:48,489
We'd fuck Iike animals.

697
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:51,652
No, I'm talking after all of that,
after you finish.

698
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:53,286
How would you feel?

699
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,197
You mean, Iike, emotionally?

700
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:56,254
Yes.

701
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,291
I'd be all open and vulnerable and shit,

702
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:02,167
and he'd be a million miles away,
back with his family.

703
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:03,798
And then?

704
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:06,602
Then I'd be so depressed, I'd call up my guy.

705
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:07,966
And?

706
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,804
And a half hour Iater, I'm using.

707
00:54:12,816 --> 00:54:16,081
-See where this goes?
-Yeah,

708
00:54:16,152 --> 00:54:17,278
Good.

709
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:19,989
But I want to so bad.

710
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:22,149
No, Dede, don't. Where are you?

711
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,485
Outside his place.

712
00:54:25,562 --> 00:54:27,553
-What? No!
-I can't help it,

713
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:29,394
AII right. Listen to me, okay?

714
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:31,730
I want you to turn around
and go someplace safe.

715
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:32,995
What's near you?

716
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:34,366
-I don't know.
-Think!

717
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:37,634
Okay, fuck!
The salon where I work is pretty close.

718
00:54:37,707 --> 00:54:38,731
Where is it?

719
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:39,900
Tell me!

720
00:54:39,976 --> 00:54:42,740
Damn, dude.
You just got all Jack Bauer on me.

721
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,109
Seriously?

722
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:55,051
You know what? Forget it.
I'm just gonna get out here.

723
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,423
Thank you. How much? Yeah. Here you go.

724
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:41,299
-Hi. Can I help you?
-Dede. Where's Dede?

725
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:42,736
Do you have an appointment?

726
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:45,098
Holy shit, Neil.

727
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:47,501
-I made it.
-Are you okay?

728
00:55:47,577 --> 00:55:50,068
-Lester hands paper.
-What?

729
00:55:54,417 --> 00:55:56,180
You seem better.

730
00:55:58,955 --> 00:56:00,252
Trade ya.

731
00:56:00,323 --> 00:56:04,089
Sorry I went all Linda BIair on you.
Here you go. Thank you.

732
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:07,330
It's the Ieast I can do. You saved my ass.

733
00:56:07,497 --> 00:56:09,863
Come on.
I'II give you a shave while you wait.

734
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:16,466
-Can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

735
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:19,099
So, what are your, Iike,
you know, I don't know...

736
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:20,733
What's your big trigger?

737
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:22,038
I don't know.

738
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:26,481
For me, it's, Iike, when I'm sad,
I wanna have sex...

739
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:32,283
-So if you...
-Or if I'm happy, or tired, or bored.

740
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:36,421
-So pretty much just emotions?
-You get the point.

741
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:40,120
-What about you?
-Me, yeah, you know...

742
00:56:40,296 --> 00:56:44,323
-I'd say my big thing is anxiety.
-Yeah, that's a big one.

743
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:48,064
Yeah, I'm pretty much anxious all the time,
so it's just, Iike...

744
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:50,965
Hey. What are you doing?

745
00:56:51,307 --> 00:56:52,899
Am I making you anxious?

746
00:56:52,976 --> 00:56:56,673
-No, seriously, what the fuck are you doing?
-Relax.

747
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:59,874
I'm about to give you
the best shave of your Iife.

748
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:02,645
-PIease don't hurt me.
-Don't make me Iaugh.

749
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,483
You got a weapon to my throat.
Why would I do that?

750
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:13,162
You know, it's weird, but from the moment
you answered, I started to feel better.

751
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:18,934
-Come on. Don't...
-I'm completely serious. I swear, it's true.

752
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:27,637
You know, when you called,
I was this close to Iosing my day count.

753
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:29,376
Really?

754
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:34,475
Sounds Iike we both had a God shot.

755
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:38,547
Yeah, you know, the whole higher power
thing kind of trips me up a Iittle bit.

756
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:41,283
I mean, I don't know if I believe it.

757
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:46,686
You know, my sponsor tells me that it's just
gotta be about something bigger than me,

758
00:57:46,763 --> 00:57:49,664
but I don't know what that means.

759
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:51,927
Well, don't over-think it.
It could be anything.

760
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:55,095
It's, Iike, service,
Iike coming here right now, helping me.

761
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:56,433
That's higher power.

762
00:58:02,545 --> 00:58:06,037
You, Iike, Iiterally
transplanted a baby's butt on my face.

763
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:09,175
That was so solid of you
to come all this way for me.

764
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:10,276
Thank you.

765
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,587
God. That's right. I almost forgot.

766
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:15,817
I have to get home
without using the subway.

767
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:17,953
Why don't you just use my bike?

768
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:21,394
-No, I can't.
-It's okay. I have another one.

769
00:58:21,531 --> 00:58:23,658
No, I mean, I Iiterally can't.

770
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,397
I'm not a good rider of bikes.

771
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:48,150
-Hey, move your shit, fat girl.
-I'm a guy, asshole!

772
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:50,583
I'm a fat guy!

773
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:53,058
Yield, please.

774
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:55,494
Who Iives Iike this?

775
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,394
Hey, sorry.

776
00:59:05,808 --> 00:59:07,799
Hey. How's it going?

777
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:11,670
-I'm gonna finish this 90 in 90 if it kills me.
-Good.

778
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:15,184
But just remember, one day at a time.

779
00:59:15,585 --> 00:59:17,450
Biking now?

780
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:20,954
-Can't forget to tuck in the cuff, man.
-Yeah. Yeah, I know.

781
00:59:21,024 --> 00:59:22,958
-That's a nice helmet you got there.
-Thank you. Appreciate it.

782
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:25,358
-What shade of pink is that again?
-I'm gonna get a new one, okay?

783
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:27,692
-It matches your shirt.
-Fuck you, dude.

784
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:30,232
You're the one who told me
I couldn't take the subway anymore,

785
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:34,532
so now I'm out there in the streets,
biking for my Iife Iike fuckin' Il Postino,

786
00:59:35,371 --> 00:59:37,498
Okay. I'm sorry.

787
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:40,065
-Why are you riding me?
-I'm sorry.

788
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:42,373
I'm just...
I'm going through some stuff right now.

789
00:59:42,946 --> 00:59:45,414
It's fine. I'm sorry.

790
00:59:45,481 --> 00:59:48,279
I just haven't jerked off in over a week.

791
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:50,876
You know, I just feel Iike
one giant blue ball right now.

792
00:59:50,954 --> 00:59:51,943
Right.

793
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:05,393
Yo, two after. Can we do this?

794
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:16,735
Okay, Adam, I'm gonna need, Iike, some
specifics here, so that I can understand.

795
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:20,407
You really wanna Iook under that rock?

796
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:24,583
I mean, if we're gonna do this,
you know, I gotta know.

797
01:00:25,421 --> 01:00:26,945
Oh, God...

798
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:32,319
Compulsive masturbation.

799
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:37,856
Hitting on every girl that I come across.

800
01:00:38,868 --> 01:00:41,234
Lots of one-night stands.

801
01:00:41,871 --> 01:00:43,862
Juggling multiple girlfriends.

802
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,368
Prostitutes?

803
01:00:46,676 --> 01:00:48,371
Prostitutes, yeah.

804
01:00:50,613 --> 01:00:52,012
I'm sorry.

805
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:56,381
-It's hard for me to picture you Iike that.
-That's it. That's the disease.

806
01:00:57,787 --> 01:01:02,417
It makes you do things
that violate everything that you believe in.

807
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,289
I wanted to stop so badly,
I can't tell you, but I couldn't.

808
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,889
I understand. I just...

809
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:14,296
The thing that scares me, if I'm honest,

810
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:18,938
is how do you know
you're not gonna fall off the wagon?

811
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:22,235
AII I can say to you is this.

812
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:26,113
I have been sober for five years.

813
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:29,208
It is the most important thing in my Iife.

814
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:33,247
And I am not planning
to Iet anything fuck that up.

815
01:01:37,326 --> 01:01:38,953
Okay.

816
01:01:42,999 --> 01:01:48,528
I'm just gonna go in there,
pick up my Iaundry and tell her my truth.

817
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:50,532
Fuckin' A you are.

818
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:54,843
-Thanks for bookending this with me, Dede,
-Thanks for Ietting me be of service.

819
01:01:55,178 --> 01:01:57,442
Now, go tell Mommy you're a sex addict.

820
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:10,219
-Hi.
-Hi, Mom.

821
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:11,487
-Honey.
-Hey.

822
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,586
What's... Okay.

823
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:17,255
-Why are you so sweaty?
-I rode my bike here. Can I...

824
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:20,166
-Since when do you bike?
-Since yesterday...

825
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:21,794
Can I come in for a second?
Can we talk about something?

826
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:24,840
Yeah, sure. But I just need you
to change one Iight bulb first.

827
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:30,502
I mean, why should I even have this
big house ifyou're never gonna be home?

828
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,810
Okay, so, Mom, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

829
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:34,474
What's going on back here?

830
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:35,574
What?

831
01:02:35,651 --> 01:02:39,747
AII this sweat and schmutz in your tuchus,
What is it?

832
01:02:39,822 --> 01:02:43,223
-It's from the bike seat.
-Well, I can't take it. It's disgusting.

833
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:44,281
Mom!

834
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,191
What?
You're, Iike, a homeless in these pants.

835
01:02:46,295 --> 01:02:48,058
Okay, can you please just
Iisten to me for one second?

836
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:50,895
No. Take them off. Just take them off.

837
01:02:53,136 --> 01:02:56,697
Okay, take these off. I'II wash 'em for you.

838
01:03:03,846 --> 01:03:07,873
Okay, so it was one of those things where
you work out, and then you're perspiring,

839
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:10,714
and you take a shower,
but not for Iong enough, apparently.

840
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:12,516
'Cause I'm giving this presentation,

841
01:03:12,588 --> 01:03:16,080
and I was, Iike,
schvitzing Iike a Russian gangster.

842
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:17,558
It was...

843
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:19,893
What?

844
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:21,560
Nothing.

845
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:23,258
This is nice.

846
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:30,838
-No PDA?
-No. Yes. Yes, on the PDA.

847
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:32,238
-Yes?
-Most definitely, yes.

848
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:34,970
Okay. Well, what about if I do this?

849
01:03:35,711 --> 01:03:37,201
Yeah, always.

850
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,679
-Really?
-Yeah.

851
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:43,151
What if I just wanna
kind of upgrade it to, Iike...

852
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:44,811
-Yeah.
-Like a TMJ.

853
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:46,149
Yeah...

854
01:03:49,392 --> 01:03:53,158
What if I... But what if I go Iike this? Is that...

855
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:56,687
-Yeah, do that forever.
-Really?

856
01:03:56,766 --> 01:04:02,068
Even when I'm an old, stinking man
with claw-Iike, arthritic claw hands?

857
01:04:02,138 --> 01:04:03,730
Will you Iove me then?

858
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:06,266
Adam.

859
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:08,105
You're killing me.

860
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:11,308
Hey.

861
01:04:12,815 --> 01:04:14,282
Becky.

862
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:16,575
Yeah, I know. I remember.

863
01:04:18,387 --> 01:04:19,479
Oh, my God.

864
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:21,853
It's been years. How are you?

865
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:25,792
Do you still have
that great apartment downtown?

866
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:29,764
-Yep. Still in the same place. This is Phoebe.
-Hello.

867
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:34,997
-Have you seen his place?
-Yes, I have, and it is great.

868
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:41,034
Great. Good. Good seeing you, Becky.

869
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:47,648
"Hint, hint, Becky, Ieave now."

870
01:04:52,822 --> 01:04:55,222
It's nice to see you, too, Adam.

871
01:05:05,468 --> 01:05:07,493
Here we are.

872
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:10,562
Make yourself at home.
I'm gonna go change.

873
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:29,651
Hey, baby.

874
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:34,128
You want a dance?

875
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:55,577
Yeah.

876
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:01,449
Hey, Iet's ease...

877
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:04,289
Just kiss me, okay?

878
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:06,358
You know the rules.

879
01:06:06,595 --> 01:06:08,062
No touching.

880
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:20,235
Hey.

881
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:23,110
What's wrong?

882
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:28,011
Listen, I...

883
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:32,312
This is taking me to places
where I've been in the past,

884
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:34,879
where I just don't wanna go right now.

885
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:38,452
I'm sorry.

886
01:06:38,527 --> 01:06:42,657
It's all right. I know you...
I mean, you gotta be careful, I get that.

887
01:06:42,732 --> 01:06:45,724
But, I mean,
aren't we allowed to be a Iittle playful?

888
01:06:45,801 --> 01:06:47,132
Absolutely.

889
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:52,899
Adam, I am a very sexual person,

890
01:06:52,975 --> 01:06:56,536
and I'm gonna need to be able
to express that side of myself with you.

891
01:06:56,612 --> 01:06:58,910
And I want you to, believe me.

892
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:02,473
I just would Iike to take it
a Iittle bit more slowly.

893
01:07:03,152 --> 01:07:05,052
Did Becky go slow?

894
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:00,207
Oh, shit!

895
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:04,239
-Yeah, it's Iooking good.
-Yeah.

896
01:08:04,313 --> 01:08:06,873
Yeah, there it goes. Finish it up.

897
01:08:06,982 --> 01:08:11,510
Hey, so you really want me there?
I mean, I can find somewhere else...

898
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:12,679
No, I want you to meet Adam.

899
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:14,780
He's a good guy.
He's got a good head. He's smart.

900
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:17,119
Smart?
Like, I'm gonna need a thesaurus to...

901
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:20,685
No, I'm just saying that
he's been through some hard times,

902
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:22,628
-and now he's doing great.
-Hard times.

903
01:08:22,698 --> 01:08:24,723
And he's bringing his new Iady friend over.
You'II Iike him.

904
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:27,826
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, I get it. Positive role model.

905
01:08:27,903 --> 01:08:32,340
Jesus, Danny, it's just dinner.
Just show up and eat the food.

906
01:08:34,176 --> 01:08:35,643
God, this house is amazing.

907
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:39,203
I Iove all the woodwork and stuff.
It's so beautiful.

908
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:44,583
-When was the house built?
-1898.

909
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:47,379
I've been renovating it since then.

910
01:08:48,991 --> 01:08:54,156
You've done a really great job.
It's very homey. It's nice.

911
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:56,425
-We Iike it.
-Thank you.

912
01:08:59,268 --> 01:09:03,864
You know, Iet's start.
It's, you know, family style. Here we go.

913
01:09:06,108 --> 01:09:09,373
That's... No, that's way too much for me.
Here, babe, Iet's...

914
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:14,041
-How much do you want?
-I'II just serve myself, it's fine. I just...

915
01:09:21,056 --> 01:09:22,455
What are you, a smurf?

916
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:25,817
Here we go.

917
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:30,559
First off, you could not
pay me enough to do a triathlon.

918
01:09:30,633 --> 01:09:32,294
Secondly, and furthermore,

919
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:36,495
I cannot believe you are voluntarily
going to swim in the Hudson fuckin' River.

920
01:09:36,572 --> 01:09:39,973
-Mike.
-What? Honey, she's a big girl.

921
01:09:40,042 --> 01:09:44,342
-Sorry about the Ianguage.
-That's okay. I accept your fucking apology.

922
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:48,646
Now you owe me an apology.

923
01:09:50,085 --> 01:09:52,952
Sorry I'm Iate.
There was an accident on the BQE.

924
01:09:53,622 --> 01:09:56,648
-The food was getting cold, so we started.
-I'II make you a plate.

925
01:09:56,725 --> 01:09:58,249
That's all right.

926
01:09:59,061 --> 01:10:01,689
Don't worry about it. I'm not hungry anyway.

927
01:10:07,736 --> 01:10:10,830
So Adam told me
that you guys were high school sweethearts.

928
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:12,134
Yeah.

929
01:10:12,274 --> 01:10:14,435
God, we were stupid.

930
01:10:17,112 --> 01:10:18,340
What?

931
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:20,678
I was just thinking about
what my Iife would've been Iike

932
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:23,013
if I had married my high school sweetheart.

933
01:10:23,085 --> 01:10:24,552
Scary, huh?

934
01:10:25,487 --> 01:10:27,182
Horror movie scary.

935
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:33,193
Yeah, Mike and I, we just got Iucky.

936
01:10:34,129 --> 01:10:35,721
Lucky's good.

937
01:10:36,298 --> 01:10:38,732
Well, you may be getting Iucky.

938
01:10:40,002 --> 01:10:42,300
Adam is a good guy.

939
01:10:45,107 --> 01:10:46,870
Yeah, he is.

940
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:54,172
Hey.

941
01:10:55,818 --> 01:10:57,445
What's wrong?

942
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:06,889
I just think I'm worried about
this whole addict thing, you know?

943
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:09,358
I mean, I just...

944
01:11:10,232 --> 01:11:13,395
Do you ever worry
that you'II be just humming along,

945
01:11:13,469 --> 01:11:17,064
and then he's just gonna
veer off back into the darkness?

946
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,071
In my experience,

947
01:11:20,542 --> 01:11:25,070
the only way that I can do this
is just to keep the focus on myself.

948
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:28,044
Meaning?

949
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:30,115
Meaning...

950
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:33,120
What about my side of the street?

951
01:11:33,188 --> 01:11:36,123
What are my issues that I have to deal with?

952
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:40,458
After all, I picked an addict,
that says something.

953
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:49,627
Yeah, so, I mean,
it's pretty much self-sustaining, you know?

954
01:11:49,705 --> 01:11:54,108
The fish, they do their thing in the water,
and that...

955
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:56,940
Yeah, and then
the phytoplankton eat the fish's waste,

956
01:11:57,012 --> 01:12:00,243
and then they create oxygen,
which the fish use,

957
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:01,908
so it's, Iike, a closed Ioop, right?

958
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:04,886
Yeah. Exactly.

959
01:12:05,421 --> 01:12:07,548
Adam's an environmental wizard.

960
01:12:08,023 --> 01:12:09,422
Is that right?

961
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:11,925
You know, I had a cell mate once
who thought he was a warlock.

962
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:14,426
So...

963
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:17,757
So nice job on the girl.

964
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:20,193
-I Iike her a Iot.
-Yeah.

965
01:12:20,969 --> 01:12:24,496
I really Iike her. I think this might have Iegs.

966
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:27,233
Hey, Iisten, if it works out,
no one will be happier than me.

967
01:12:27,309 --> 01:12:29,834
And ifyou don't make me the best man,
I will fuck up your wedding.

968
01:12:30,045 --> 01:12:32,240
Mike, you're the best, man.

969
01:12:32,481 --> 01:12:34,608
What are you saying?
I'm the best man, or I'm, Iike...

970
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:36,446
You're the best...

971
01:12:36,919 --> 01:12:37,943
Man.

972
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:40,716
That's not a committal.
You're not committing.

973
01:12:40,789 --> 01:12:42,347
-I will fuck up your wedding.
-You're the best man.

974
01:12:42,424 --> 01:12:44,722
-I will fall into the wedding cake.
-You are the best, man.

975
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:47,455
I will be the one
that will not forever hold his peace.

976
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:49,427
Hey.

977
01:12:50,232 --> 01:12:52,928
You think I could be your best man
when you two get married?

978
01:12:56,472 --> 01:12:57,905
Nothing? AII right.

979
01:13:13,422 --> 01:13:17,085
A Iot of smells going on in here.
You getting that?

980
01:13:17,526 --> 01:13:21,189
It's Iike patchouli mixed with BO and hugs.

981
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:23,821
Hey, Judgie Judgerstein,
I'm glad you could make it.

982
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:26,891
You know,
I'm not really a dancer so much as a walker.

983
01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:30,496
-You gotta Iet your spontanuity go.
-I don't think that's actually a word.

984
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:31,937
Relax.

985
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:34,770
Ecstatic dancing is not about Iooking good.

986
01:13:35,043 --> 01:13:37,637
It's about
getting in touch with your higher power.

987
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:40,840
You're gonna make me find
this higher power even if it kills ya, huh?

988
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:43,942
Relax, babe. Let your inhibitions run wild.

989
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:46,214
I don't think inhibitions can...

990
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:16,574
I Iike that Phoebe, babe.

991
01:14:16,685 --> 01:14:19,415
And I Iike her for him.
I think they could make it.

992
01:14:21,156 --> 01:14:22,418
What do you think?

993
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:24,725
I'm not so sure.

994
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:30,220
-What are you talking about?
-I don't know. I'm just not so sure.

995
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:31,857
Are you kidding me?

996
01:14:31,934 --> 01:14:33,526
You didn't see
how they were Iooking at each other?

997
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:38,733
That's the same kind of Iook we used to
give each other, Iike, 30 years ago.

998
01:14:40,742 --> 01:14:42,403
Have you seen my pain pills?

999
01:14:43,378 --> 01:14:44,902
They're not in the cabinet?

1000
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:46,777
No. Weird.

1001
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:51,847
I don't fuckin' believe it.

1002
01:14:51,987 --> 01:14:54,820
Mike, you don't know that.

1003
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:03,196
Gotta tell you, Mike really Iiked you.

1004
01:15:03,365 --> 01:15:05,162
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1005
01:15:06,368 --> 01:15:08,928
Believe me, he's a hard sell.

1006
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:11,230
I'm glad I passed the test.

1007
01:15:12,941 --> 01:15:15,136
Come on, I didn't mean it Iike that.

1008
01:15:16,378 --> 01:15:17,538
What's the matter?

1009
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:20,446
Nothing.
I'm just cranky. I missed my run.

1010
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:22,313
I know that's your drug.

1011
01:15:22,985 --> 01:15:24,577
What? Nothing.

1012
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:29,855
I know another way
to get endorphins going.

1013
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:32,189
God, I'm about to crash.

1014
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:35,753
I have a 70 breakfast.

1015
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:41,492
I'II make it up to you, I promise.

1016
01:15:43,238 --> 01:15:45,536
You don't have to promise me sex.

1017
01:17:22,037 --> 01:17:24,597
Sounds Iike you had a really good time.

1018
01:17:28,677 --> 01:17:30,736
You know, I don't know if I could approve

1019
01:17:30,812 --> 01:17:36,216
ofyou grinding up against
a bunch of sweaty undulating bodies.

1020
01:17:37,586 --> 01:17:39,850
No, no, no, I'm in for the night.

1021
01:17:42,557 --> 01:17:46,186
Maybe I could get away
for a few minutes tomorrow at Iunch.

1022
01:17:46,895 --> 01:17:48,453
Sounds Iike fun.

1023
01:17:49,631 --> 01:17:51,758
Okay, good. Good night.

1024
01:17:52,467 --> 01:17:54,731
Hey. Did I wake you up?

1025
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:58,836
Who was that? Who are you talking to?

1026
01:17:58,907 --> 01:18:00,238
What?

1027
01:18:00,308 --> 01:18:02,868
-Who are you on the phone with?
-My sponsee.

1028
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:06,575
Really? At 2:00 in the morning?

1029
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:09,150
Yeah, he was calling to check in.

1030
01:18:12,487 --> 01:18:14,079
Can I see your phone?

1031
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:15,916
Are you serious?

1032
01:18:15,991 --> 01:18:20,985
-You don't want me to see your phone?
-No, and I resent you asking me to see it.

1033
01:18:21,096 --> 01:18:23,564
Which makes me think
that you're hiding something.

1034
01:18:23,632 --> 01:18:24,826
You know what, Phoebe?

1035
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:26,765
This isn't gonna work
without a Iittle bit of trust.

1036
01:18:27,302 --> 01:18:30,328
-Let me see your phone.
-No.

1037
01:18:30,472 --> 01:18:31,837
-Give me your phone.
-No.

1038
01:18:31,907 --> 01:18:33,204
-Just give me your phone.
-I'm not Ietting you...

1039
01:18:33,275 --> 01:18:34,936
Just give me the fuckin' phone.

1040
01:18:41,283 --> 01:18:42,511
Happy?

1041
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:49,056
-What's going on with you?
-What's going on with you, Adam?

1042
01:18:49,124 --> 01:18:50,523
What is going on?

1043
01:18:51,259 --> 01:18:53,989
I feel Iike
you're starting to pull away from me.

1044
01:18:54,262 --> 01:18:55,889
I mean, am I crazy?

1045
01:18:58,033 --> 01:18:59,864
Yeah, you're right, I know.

1046
01:19:01,269 --> 01:19:03,669
So are you gonna talk to me about it?

1047
01:19:05,073 --> 01:19:06,199
Yeah.

1048
01:19:09,711 --> 01:19:11,679
I guess, you know...

1049
01:19:15,117 --> 01:19:17,585
For me, for so Iong, you know,

1050
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:24,715
sex was, Iike, this secretive chase
for a fix, right?

1051
01:19:25,393 --> 01:19:27,520
And now, with us,

1052
01:19:29,164 --> 01:19:31,132
it's really hard for me to connect that

1053
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:35,465
to something that's
Ioving and intimate and real.

1054
01:19:35,537 --> 01:19:37,471
And it's not you.

1055
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:40,037
What?

1056
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:42,639
-What?
-I just don't...

1057
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:45,204
I don't know if I can do this.

1058
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,043
Why? Why not? What do you mean?

1059
01:19:47,249 --> 01:19:49,342
We can do it. We just have to do the work.

1060
01:19:49,417 --> 01:19:51,749
Do the work? Adam, we just met.

1061
01:19:51,887 --> 01:19:56,415
I mean, this is crazy.
We should be in the honeymoon phase.

1062
01:19:56,491 --> 01:19:58,459
What do you mean honeymoon?
Where do you get that from?

1063
01:19:58,527 --> 01:20:00,552
What, did you read that in a book?

1064
01:20:03,365 --> 01:20:05,526
I think that I might...

1065
01:20:06,735 --> 01:20:10,933
-What?
-Need someone who's healthier.

1066
01:20:11,006 --> 01:20:12,803
-Healthier?
-Or not healthier, but...

1067
01:20:12,874 --> 01:20:16,310
No. Because I'm sick,
and you, you're healthy

1068
01:20:16,378 --> 01:20:21,111
with your compulsive exercising
and your crazy fucking food bullshit?

1069
01:20:23,084 --> 01:20:25,143
I think you're a really great guy, Adam.

1070
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:30,624
No, you think that I'm a sick piece of shit.
But don't worry. You, you're perfect, right?

1071
01:20:51,446 --> 01:20:52,470
What's up?

1072
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:54,611
Honey, sit down.

1073
01:20:55,984 --> 01:20:57,246
What happened?

1074
01:20:58,453 --> 01:21:00,284
Did you take your mom's pain pills?

1075
01:21:01,623 --> 01:21:04,091
-Did I what?
-Simple question.

1076
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:07,424
Did you go into our bathroom
and steal your mother's pills?

1077
01:21:08,129 --> 01:21:10,029
No. I told you guys, I'm clean.

1078
01:21:10,098 --> 01:21:13,329
Then what happened?
Did they just sprout wings and fly away?

1079
01:21:13,401 --> 01:21:14,663
Mike, come on.

1080
01:21:16,104 --> 01:21:18,595
I'm never gonna be anything
but a fuck-up to you, am I?

1081
01:21:18,673 --> 01:21:20,698
Honey, we won't be mad.

1082
01:21:22,043 --> 01:21:24,068
Give us the goddamn pills.

1083
01:21:24,145 --> 01:21:25,544
What pills?

1084
01:21:25,614 --> 01:21:28,447
You mean the pills she has to take
'cause of what you gave her?

1085
01:21:28,516 --> 01:21:30,347
-Those pills?
-You watch your tone.

1086
01:21:30,418 --> 01:21:32,181
What tone, huh? The tone I Iearned from you

1087
01:21:32,254 --> 01:21:35,018
when you used to come into my room
at night with your fuckin' Jameson's breath

1088
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:36,955
-and smack me around? That tone?
-What are you talking about?

1089
01:21:37,025 --> 01:21:38,458
-Right, Ma?
-What are you talking about?

1090
01:21:38,526 --> 01:21:39,754
Say something!

1091
01:21:39,928 --> 01:21:41,259
Yeah, take his side
Iike you always fuckin' did.

1092
01:21:41,329 --> 01:21:43,422
-Stop talking ancient history!
-That always fuckin' worked.

1093
01:21:43,498 --> 01:21:46,729
-We're talking about right now.
-Good. Fine. Right now, I want an apology.

1094
01:21:46,801 --> 01:21:48,029
-You want an apology?
-Yeah.

1095
01:21:48,103 --> 01:21:51,129
You got some fuckin' stones, kid.
Apology for what?

1096
01:21:51,206 --> 01:21:53,401
For accusing me
of something I didn't fuckin' do!

1097
01:21:53,475 --> 01:21:55,409
-Are you kidding me?
-Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

1098
01:21:56,444 --> 01:21:59,902
That's right, 'cause that would mean
admitting that you're wrong, wouldn't it?

1099
01:21:59,981 --> 01:22:01,278
Big Mike's never wrong.

1100
01:22:01,349 --> 01:22:04,785
-What are you talking about?
-I'm talking about you, Mr. 1 2-Step.

1101
01:22:04,853 --> 01:22:06,718
You can go pretend that you're Mr. Recovery

1102
01:22:06,821 --> 01:22:10,086
to all your sponsees
who think you're Jesus fucking Christ.

1103
01:22:10,225 --> 01:22:11,749
Guess what, Dad?

1104
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:14,920
I know the truth about you.
You were a monster then.

1105
01:22:14,996 --> 01:22:18,625
You're a goddamn hypocrite now,
telling them to go make amends.

1106
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:20,861
You've never even
made amends to your own son

1107
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:23,530
for all the shit that you did to me,
all the shit that you put me through.

1108
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:24,833
Yes, I did, I did.

1109
01:22:24,906 --> 01:22:27,204
You did?
When did you ever make an amends to me?

1110
01:22:27,275 --> 01:22:28,867
-When?
-I...

1111
01:22:29,077 --> 01:22:32,843
That's right, never.
You never did. You can start right now.

1112
01:22:32,981 --> 01:22:36,576
-Dad, say you're sorry to me.
-I'm not saying I'm sorry to you.

1113
01:22:37,385 --> 01:22:40,411
-Say you're sorry to me.
-I am not saying I'm sorry to you.

1114
01:22:40,488 --> 01:22:43,321
-Say you're fucking sorry to me!
-I am not saying I'm sorry to you!

1115
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:45,723
That's right, 'cause you're a fuckin' coward!

1116
01:22:49,998 --> 01:22:51,431
Stop it!

1117
01:22:53,935 --> 01:22:56,699
Stop it! Stop it!

1118
01:24:14,682 --> 01:24:16,206
Hey, Mike, it's Adam.

1119
01:24:16,284 --> 01:24:20,311
Yeah, I'm in DC
for this postal service meeting,

1120
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:24,548
and I'm not doing so good, man.

1121
01:24:24,826 --> 01:24:26,817
Yeah, it's over with Phoebe.

1122
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:30,490
And I'm having
some really dark thoughts here, brother.

1123
01:24:30,932 --> 01:24:33,457
So, can you give me a call
when you get this, please?

1124
01:24:33,535 --> 01:24:35,059
Okay, thanks, man. Bye.

1125
01:24:37,605 --> 01:24:39,232
Come on, come on.

1126
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:42,142
Hey, Margo. Hey, it's Adam.

1127
01:24:42,210 --> 01:24:43,768
How you doing?

1128
01:24:43,845 --> 01:24:45,039
I'm great.

1129
01:24:45,113 --> 01:24:49,311
Hey, Iisten. Do you think I could
swing by there and grab the computer?

1130
01:24:49,384 --> 01:24:51,909
There's a couple edits
I wanna make on the...

1131
01:24:54,222 --> 01:24:57,885
You know what? I'm fine.
Let's just... We'II bang it out in the morning.

1132
01:24:57,959 --> 01:24:59,984
Okay, good night. Thanks, bye.

1133
01:25:00,728 --> 01:25:02,525
Fucking idiot.

1134
01:25:32,861 --> 01:25:34,988
Yeah.

1135
01:25:36,731 --> 01:25:38,198
Yeah.

1136
01:26:21,276 --> 01:26:22,402
Adam?

1137
01:26:30,451 --> 01:26:32,544
Yeah, slow.

1138
01:26:32,887 --> 01:26:34,616
Yeah, slow.

1139
01:26:56,511 --> 01:26:58,376
-Hey.
-Hi, baby.

1140
01:26:58,479 --> 01:27:00,970
I am so happy to see you.

1141
01:27:01,182 --> 01:27:03,707
Thanks for coming.
I was seriously bugging out.

1142
01:27:03,785 --> 01:27:08,154
-Jesus. There's more shit than air in here.
-Yeah, I know.

1143
01:27:08,289 --> 01:27:11,622
You gotta do something about this, dude.
This is not conclusive to your sobriety.

1144
01:27:11,693 --> 01:27:14,093
-I think you mean conducive.
-You got any garbage bags?

1145
01:27:14,529 --> 01:27:17,225
Yes. Yes, I do. Hang on.

1146
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:29,236
Dude, explain this to me.

1147
01:27:29,644 --> 01:27:32,442
You're trying to stay sober
and you still have your porn collection?

1148
01:27:32,513 --> 01:27:36,415
Yeah, I'm really just stashing it up here.
I don't actually watch any of it anymore.

1149
01:27:36,551 --> 01:27:38,849
-We need to get rid of this.
-I know.

1150
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:41,047
No. We need to get rid of this now.

1151
01:28:01,342 --> 01:28:03,139
You okay with this?

1152
01:28:03,745 --> 01:28:06,009
It's Iike burying an old friend.

1153
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:20,792
Burning porn, My Lord

1154
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:22,824
Kumbaya

1155
01:28:22,897 --> 01:28:24,125
Really?

1156
01:28:24,599 --> 01:28:26,362
Neil's shit's burning, My Lord

1157
01:28:26,434 --> 01:28:27,696
Okay.

1158
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:29,831
Kumbaya

1159
01:28:32,607 --> 01:28:36,373
How am I gonna jack off now, My Lord?

1160
01:28:37,078 --> 01:28:39,137
Kumbaya

1161
01:28:40,081 --> 01:28:44,279
Oh, Lord, Kumbaya

1162
01:28:45,586 --> 01:28:47,451
You were a Iittle high.

1163
01:28:50,058 --> 01:28:51,423
What's wrong?

1164
01:28:53,628 --> 01:28:57,029
I've never been just friends
with a guy before.

1165
01:28:57,198 --> 01:28:58,460
It's so...

1166
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,267
What?

1167
01:29:01,602 --> 01:29:02,864
Hot.

1168
01:29:06,874 --> 01:29:08,933
I Iove you, big man.

1169
01:29:09,477 --> 01:29:12,241
I Iove you, too, small tattooed woman.

1170
01:29:41,409 --> 01:29:42,933
I fucked up.

1171
01:29:55,523 --> 01:29:58,754
You always have to be right,
don't you, Mike?

1172
01:29:58,826 --> 01:30:00,987
-AIways.
-Really? You gonna start this?

1173
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:02,723
Just get out.

1174
01:30:08,970 --> 01:30:11,234
Fuck it. I'm gonna go.

1175
01:30:15,810 --> 01:30:17,778
Danny, come on, call us.

1176
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:21,205
Your mom is worried.

1177
01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:24,711
Really? Really?

1178
01:31:01,255 --> 01:31:02,722
Hey, it's Adam.

1179
01:31:03,624 --> 01:31:05,421
You wanna come by?

1180
01:31:21,042 --> 01:31:23,010
Give me a five scratches.

1181
01:31:29,851 --> 01:31:31,682
3 Musketeers bar.

1182
01:31:34,889 --> 01:31:36,379
Is that it?

1183
01:31:38,759 --> 01:31:40,624
Yeah. Let me have...

1184
01:31:42,530 --> 01:31:45,693
A bottle of bourbon, fifth of bourbon.

1185
01:31:46,734 --> 01:31:47,894
Yeah.

1186
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:14,425
Hey.

1187
01:32:15,596 --> 01:32:17,029
What happened?

1188
01:32:17,265 --> 01:32:18,493
Where is he?

1189
01:32:18,566 --> 01:32:20,158
Katie, breathe.

1190
01:32:32,647 --> 01:32:37,641
And then at the last minute, this guyjust,
like, jumps in front of me and takes my cab,

1191
01:32:37,718 --> 01:32:38,776
I go down to the subway,

1192
01:32:38,853 --> 01:32:40,787
I'm waiting for the subway for,
like, 20 minutes,

1193
01:32:40,855 --> 01:32:45,155
I get on, and after two stops, they stop it,
and they say it's 'cause of a sick passenger,

1194
01:32:45,226 --> 01:32:48,821
Like, how much of a diva do you have to be
to stop a whole train?

1195
01:32:48,896 --> 01:32:51,091
The gumption, it's crazy.

1196
01:32:51,766 --> 01:32:54,394
I remember this place.

1197
01:32:54,969 --> 01:32:57,335
Oh, my God. I Iove this rug.

1198
01:32:57,872 --> 01:32:59,840
Are you sure you're not gay?

1199
01:33:00,508 --> 01:33:01,941
Pretty sure.

1200
01:33:03,511 --> 01:33:05,604
Okay.

1201
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:06,806
Give it a second.

1202
01:33:06,881 --> 01:33:09,873
-You're so fucking hot.
-Thank you.

1203
01:33:10,785 --> 01:33:12,252
Time out.

1204
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,844
Why don't you
make me a drink or something?

1205
01:33:13,921 --> 01:33:17,914
Of course. I'm sorry. How rude of me.
What would the Iady Iike?

1206
01:33:17,992 --> 01:33:22,053
The Iady would Iike a glass of red wine
if the gentleman has one.

1207
01:33:22,129 --> 01:33:23,756
The Iady's in Iuck.

1208
01:33:28,069 --> 01:33:30,697
I was so surprised when you called me.

1209
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:33,964
It's been a very Iong time.

1210
01:33:34,041 --> 01:33:36,032
I'm glad you picked up.

1211
01:33:38,412 --> 01:33:41,381
So what was the deal with that girl?

1212
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:43,144
Is she your girlfriend?

1213
01:33:43,217 --> 01:33:45,549
Yeah, that's pretty much over.

1214
01:33:47,188 --> 01:33:50,089
Well, I'm glad you called.

1215
01:33:51,125 --> 01:33:55,186
Gives me an excuse
to wear this brand-new Iittle dress I bought.

1216
01:33:55,296 --> 01:33:56,923
I know.

1217
01:33:58,232 --> 01:34:00,462
Yeah, I Iove this dress.

1218
01:34:00,935 --> 01:34:02,232
Yeah.

1219
01:34:03,137 --> 01:34:05,469
You don't think it's too short?

1220
01:34:05,973 --> 01:34:07,440
Not at all.

1221
01:34:08,309 --> 01:34:09,606
Really?

1222
01:34:11,278 --> 01:34:15,977
You don't think it's, Iike, a Iittle naughty?

1223
01:34:17,451 --> 01:34:18,941
I don't know.

1224
01:34:21,389 --> 01:34:22,686
I do.

1225
01:34:25,459 --> 01:34:30,328
I don't think I should be allowed
to go out Iike this, right?

1226
01:34:33,234 --> 01:34:35,327
No, you shouldn't.

1227
01:34:35,403 --> 01:34:37,098
Go on.

1228
01:34:37,171 --> 01:34:38,604
Go change your dress.

1229
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,803
But I don't wanna change.

1230
01:34:41,776 --> 01:34:45,576
Becky, did you hear me?
I told you to go change, now.

1231
01:34:45,646 --> 01:34:48,240
-Or what?
-Becky, I said change your dress.

1232
01:34:48,315 --> 01:34:49,839
Fuck you. I'm not a child anymore.

1233
01:34:49,917 --> 01:34:53,080
Hey, this is my house.
You're ruled by my rules.

1234
01:34:53,154 --> 01:34:55,213
Daddy, stop it! You're hurting me.

1235
01:34:55,289 --> 01:34:57,757
Becky, you gonna change your dress?

1236
01:34:57,825 --> 01:34:58,917
No.

1237
01:34:59,393 --> 01:35:02,658
You wanna be a big girl?
Fine. I'II treat you Iike a big girl.

1238
01:35:03,564 --> 01:35:05,589
-No, Daddy!
-Yeah.

1239
01:35:05,666 --> 01:35:07,566
-What are you doing? Stop.
-Yeah.

1240

You want me to stop, huh?

01:36:22,109 --> 01:36:24,077
-Are you all right?

1266
01:36:25,146 --> 01:36:26,875
-Come on, talk to me.

It's all right. It's okay. It's okay.

1273
01:36:57,945 --> 01:37:00,607
Get away from me!

1274
01:37:07,655 --> 01:37:08,849

1275
01:37:09,256 --> 01:37:11,486
Becky, hey.

1276
01:37:12,092 --> 01:37:13,559
Becky, come on.

1277
01:37:13,627 --> 01:37:15,356
Get away from me!

1278
01:37:15,429 --> 01:37:19,263
Open the door, okay?
Come on. Come on out of there.

1279
01:37:20,134 --> 01:37:21,567
Fuck.

Hey, come on. Talk to me.

1281
01:37:23,938 --> 01:37:26,270
Get away from me!

01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:30,538
Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing in there?

1283
01:37:30,611 --> 01:37:32,101
Hey, hey!

1284
01:37:32,346 --> 01:37:36,146
You know what? Becky, this isn't funny.
Come on now.

1285
01:37:38,919 --> 01:37:41,615
I can't take it.

1286
01:37:45,192 --> 01:37:50,255
Mike, I need your help.
Call me ASAP, man, seriously.

1287
01:38:00,841 --> 01:38:03,241
Dude, where have you been?
I've been trying to call you.

1288
01:38:05,246 --> 01:38:06,440
Who?

1289
01:38:07,414 --> 01:38:08,745
What girl?

1290
01:38:10,618 --> 01:38:12,609
AII right.

No!

01:38:19,493 --> 01:38:21,358
Fuckin' animals!

1293
01:38:22,897 --> 01:38:24,592
You see who did this?

1294
01:38:25,366 --> 01:38:26,355
Fuck!

1295
01:39:13,547 --> 01:39:14,605

01:39:14,682 --> 01:39:15,706
Where is she?

1297
01:39:15,783 --> 01:39:19,412
Right here, in the bathroom.
She's right there on the Ieft.

1298
01:39:19,553 --> 01:39:20,645
-Hey...

1299
01:39:20,721 --> 01:39:23,281

1300
01:39:23,357 --> 01:39:25,257
We're worried about you, sweetie.
How about you open the door?

1301
01:39:28,862 --> 01:39:30,295
Becky! Hey!

1302
01:39:31,532 --> 01:39:32,760

1303
01:39:32,967 --> 01:39:35,299
-Adam, move!

1304
01:39:38,572 --> 01:39:39,903
-Becky. Come on.

1305
01:39:40,007 --> 01:39:41,235

1306
01:39:42,343 --> 01:39:44,709
Come on. You talk to me here.

1307
01:39:44,778 --> 01:39:45,836

1308
01:39:47,414 --> 01:39:48,938
Adam, 9-1-1!

1309
01:39:54,722 --> 01:39:59,716
Yeah, we need an ambulance quick
at 135 West 3rd Street, apartment 2B.

1310
01:39:59,793 --> 01:40:02,159
Young female, polysubstance overdose.

1311
01:40:02,363 --> 01:40:06,424
-Did you get that? Okay. PIease hurry.
-Stay with me, Becky.

1312
01:40:07,935 --> 01:40:09,163
Oh, man.

1313
01:40:09,803 --> 01:40:12,101
Dude, it's all right. She's gonna be okay.

1314
01:40:20,547 --> 01:40:24,313
Dude, you really are Anthony Edwards.

1315
01:40:25,552 --> 01:40:27,110
Fuck that.

1316
01:40:27,421 --> 01:40:29,150
I'm George CIooney.

1317
01:40:35,295 --> 01:40:39,322
We're Iooking for our son, Danny Burns.
We've heard he's on the fifth floor.

1318
01:40:45,873 --> 01:40:47,340
Baby.

1319
01:40:55,315 --> 01:40:56,907
Are you okay?

1320
01:40:57,017 --> 01:41:00,043
Yeah, I'm fine, Ma. Are you all right?

1321
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:01,610
Yeah, I'm...

1322
01:41:02,723 --> 01:41:03,815
Are you in pain?

1323
01:41:04,124 --> 01:41:05,421
No.

1324
01:41:06,427 --> 01:41:08,622
They got me on the good stuff.

1325
01:41:11,331 --> 01:41:13,424
I didn't even have to steal it.

1326
01:41:15,202 --> 01:41:18,399
We know that you didn't take the pills.

1327
01:41:19,406 --> 01:41:21,169
Right, Mike?

1328
01:41:23,143 --> 01:41:24,940
Will you tell him?

1329
01:41:26,847 --> 01:41:28,542
Fuckin' hysterical.

1330
01:41:30,551 --> 01:41:33,486
First drink or drug in eight months.

1331
01:41:33,754 --> 01:41:36,518
I total the car. I get arrested for DUI.

1332
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:42,558
You must be fuckin' Ioving this.

1333
01:41:44,731 --> 01:41:46,062
Look at you.

1334
01:41:47,634 --> 01:41:49,568
What's on your mind, Pop?

1335
01:41:51,939 --> 01:41:53,668
Why don't you tell me?

1336
01:41:54,341 --> 01:41:57,435
Tell me this is what I get
for white-knuckling it.

1337
01:42:12,059 --> 01:42:13,549
I'm sorry.

1338
01:42:14,862 --> 01:42:16,489
I'm so sorry.

1339
01:42:18,298 --> 01:42:19,959
I'm sorry.

1340
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:56,136
Thanks for meeting me.
It's really good to see you.

1341
01:42:56,203 --> 01:42:57,761
Yeah, you, too.

1342
01:42:57,938 --> 01:43:03,308
I thought a Iot about what happened,
and I wanted to clear the air between us.

1343
01:43:07,781 --> 01:43:12,480
I just wanna say that I really regret
some of the things I said to you that night.

1344
01:43:14,087 --> 01:43:15,520
I'm sorry.

1345
01:43:16,190 --> 01:43:17,521
I'm not.

1346
01:43:18,292 --> 01:43:20,351
It was good. I...

1347
01:43:20,427 --> 01:43:23,692
You forced me to Iook at myself.
I needed to hear it.

1348
01:43:24,765 --> 01:43:26,392
How'd that go?

1349
01:43:26,833 --> 01:43:29,393
Not so good, yeah.

1350
01:43:29,636 --> 01:43:32,571
Turns out, I'm not perfect.

1351
01:43:33,140 --> 01:43:36,007
No, but you're pretty fuckin' awesome.

1352
01:43:39,446 --> 01:43:42,609
Oh, God. It's not fair, you know?

1353
01:43:43,283 --> 01:43:44,716
What?

1354
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:48,848
I still hate everybody but you.

1355
01:44:11,612 --> 01:44:15,981
I'm gonna ask you to sit
and Iisten to me for one second.

1356
01:44:17,751 --> 01:44:20,413
Things are going to change between us.

1357
01:44:21,288 --> 01:44:26,021
From now on, I'm going to be a son.

1358
01:44:27,127 --> 01:44:31,359
I should do something for myself
to show that I Iove myself.

1359
01:44:31,732 --> 01:44:36,192
Give me the most damaged guy
you could find and I was, Iike, in heaven.

1360
01:44:36,603 --> 01:44:39,834
I'm halfway through my ninth step Iist.

1361
01:44:39,906 --> 01:44:42,101
Just did my first wife.

1362
01:44:42,175 --> 01:44:43,733
That was fun.

1363
01:44:44,611 --> 01:44:47,239
I miss acting out.

1364
01:44:47,848 --> 01:44:49,941
I do, I'm serious.

1365
01:44:50,217 --> 01:44:53,209
This disease won't Iet me take a compliment

1366
01:44:53,420 --> 01:44:59,381
unless it comes from, Iike, I don't know,
a muscley, tattooed Latino man.

1367
01:44:59,626 --> 01:45:03,494
My wife would ask where I was,
and I would say I was at meetings at work,

1368
01:45:03,563 --> 01:45:05,622
and I Ied a double Iife for a Iong time.

1369
01:45:05,932 --> 01:45:07,422
There are keep-coming-back chips

1370
01:45:07,501 --> 01:45:11,403
for newcomers and members wishing
to reaffirm their commitment to sobriety.

1371
01:45:11,672 --> 01:45:14,766
Is anyone celebrating 30 days?

1372
01:45:53,513 --> 01:45:54,707
You're welcome.
