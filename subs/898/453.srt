00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,210
我们呢?有什么?
And me,what did I have?

142
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,350
死守的神圣任务
The sacred duty to resist!

143
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,890
我必须报告最高领袖
I have to report to the boss.

144
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:44,160
你最好自我了断
Perhaps you'd prefer to avoid the red tape.

145
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,530
我叫…
My name is...

146
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:14,390
尼吉达.卓基域治.赫鲁晓夫
Nikita Sergeyevich Kruschev.

147
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:18,200
我来接管这里
I've come to take things in hand here.

148
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:22,000
这里不是库斯克
This city is not Kursk...

149
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,580
不是基辅 也不是明斯克
nor is it Kiev,nor Minsk.

150
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,640
而是斯大林格勒
This city is Stalingrad.

151
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,310
斯大林…格勒
Stalingrad!

152
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,610
本市背负着领袖的名字
This city bears the name of the boss.

153
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,850
不仅是个城市 更是个标志
It's more than a city, it's a symbol.

154
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:44,990
假如德军占领了这里
If the Germans capture this city,

155
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:48,500
全国就会瓦解
the entire country will collapse.

156
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:56,330
现在我希望士兵们昂起头来！
Now,I want our boys... to raise their heads.

157
00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:00,200
我要他们拿出勇气来！
I want them to act like they have balls!

158
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:05,050
不准他们再怕得屎滚尿流！
I want them to stop shitting their pants!

159
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,290
你们是政委
That's your job.

160
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:17,190
激励士气是你们的职责
As political officers, I'm counting on you.

161
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:23,820
你 你有什么建议?

把退缩的将军、参谋长统统枪毙
Shoot all the other generals who have retreated... and their chiefs of staff too.

163
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,810
立下范例
M-Make some examples.

164
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,710
放逐逃兵的家属 做过了
一 D - D - Deport families of the deserters.一 Yeah,that's all been done.

165
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:37,750
给士兵希望
Give them hope!

166
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:53,630
他们现在不是死于敌军就是我军
Here,the men's only choice is between German bullets and ours.

167
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,890
不过 还有另一条路
But there's another way.

168
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:00,040
就是勇气之路、爱国之路
The way of courage.The way of love of the motherland.

169
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,770
我们必须再次印发军报
We must publish the army newspaper again.

170
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:06,280
报导英勇事迹 歌颂报国精神
We must tell magnificent stories. Stories that extol... sacrifice,bravery.

171
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,610
确立必胜信念
We must make them believe in the victory.

172
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:13,380
燃点群众的希望 激发斗志
We must give them hope, pride,a desire to fight.

173
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:17,120
是的 我们要立下范例
Yes,we need to make examples.

174
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,590
但那是供人学习的范例
But examples to follow.

175
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,550
我们需要…
What we need...

176
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,820

177

这里有英雄?
Do you know any heroes around here?

178

186
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:02,100
不是尾页 也不是第二页

Tania is like a daughter to me.

278
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:34,630
我在工厂干活时 沙夏由她照顾
She used to take care of Sacha when I worked at the factory.

279
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,530
她甚至教沙夏德语
She even taught him German.

280
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,730
这些书都是她的 是你的?
一 All these books are hers. 一 Oh,they're yours?

281
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,100
她在大学读德文
She studied German at the university.

282
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,400
哪间大学?  莫斯科大学
一 Which university? 一 Moscow.

283
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,280
莫斯科
Moscow. Moscow.

284
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:55,250
要不要…
Shouldn't we,uh-

285
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,780
好 继续覆信
Yes,let's continue.

286
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:04,870
你们提议把矿场要以我命名
Your offer to name Your mine after me...

287
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:08,580
我深感荣幸
is... a great honor.

288
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:15,670
HON… 我懂得串“荣幸”
H - O - N. Yes,I know. Honor.

289
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,400
很好
Very good.

290
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,310
应不应该…
Shouldn't we

291
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,710
强调不只我孤军作战?
Shouldn't we try make the point that I'm not the only one fighting?

292
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,750
你说得有道理 瓦西里 好主意
That - That's excellent - excellent idea,Vassili.

293
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:29,880
可以在下面阐明 嗯

294
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,920
对 下面阐明

295
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:36,550
你们为挖煤而奋斗…
Your battle for The production of coal...

296
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,320
所作出的贡献一样重要
is as worthy as mine.

297
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:45,040
“煤”没有K字
There's no "K" in coal.

298
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:49,340
只有一个L字 对了
Just - just one "L."

299
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:52,240
我是不是说得太快?
Oh,tell me if I'm going too fast.

300
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,584
你说得不太快 真的吗?
一 No,you're not going too fast. 一 You sure?

301
00:33:55,585 --> 00:33:57,720
我希望自己有进步
I just thought is there Any other improvements?

302
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,510
你们休息一会吧

信可以明天再写
These letters can wait until tomorrow.

304

我们要继续写
We should carry on.

305
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,950
我们不累 谢谢关心 费太太
We're not tired.Thank you,Mrs.Filipov.

306

这些人水深火热中一番热诚写信来
These people... took the trouble to write to us.

307
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,530
我们明天未必有机会回覆
Tomorrow,we may not be around to write back.

308
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:22,290
1942年10月21日德军总部

309
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,700
将军 康尼少校到
Major Konig, Herr General.

310
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:54,330
我早知道柏林会派人来
I was expecting someone... else.

311
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:56,670
但没想到是鼎鼎大名的你
Certainly not someone so prestigious.

312
00:35:56,870 --> 00:36:03,300
你肯插手这棘手的事 必有原因
I imagine you have your reasons... for getting yourself involved in this hellish situation.

313
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:09,810
我军不习惯这种作战方式
My army is not designed For this kind of fighting.

314
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:13,440
昨天我要提升25个沙展
Yesterday,yet again, I had to promote...25 sergeants

315
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:16,780
代替那些死于狙击手枪下的军官
to replace the officers shot down by their sharpshooters.

316
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:22,560
那些狙击手使我军士气大挫
Those snipers are demoralizing my people.

317
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:29,490
这个城市如同一堆残垣断瓦
This city is no more than... a heap of ruins.

318
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,730
不过 元首还要穷追猛打
But the fuehrer's persisting.

319
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:38,400
藉此解决他和斯大林的私人恩怨
He has made it a personal matter between Stalin and himself.

320
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:47,090
我们应该信赖元首的直觉
We should trust the fuehrer's instinct.

321
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:50,820
他一向带领我们取得胜利
He always managed to lead us to victory.

322
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:55,390
我们可以回家度圣诞

323
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:03,600
你打算怎样找这年轻的俄人?

They have a problem in the department store sector. They need us. Come on.

328

那狙击手躲在百货公司里面
Look,Vassili,he's hiding in the department store. Over there.

329
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,190

00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,650
看到
Yeah,I see him.

336
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:16,810
射中了！
There,you got him!

337
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,980
好枪法！
Great shot.

338
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,210
去拿他的军牌吧
Let's go get his dog tag.

339
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,210
再见 政委同志

随便借阅好了
You can borrow whatever you like.

342
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:49,470
捧着一堆哥德、雪莱作品回去…
I'm not sure what they would say to me at headquarters...

343
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:51,670
总部的人会说闲话的
if I came back with an armful of Goethe and Schiller.

344
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,510
我也有马克思的作品
There's some Marx too.

345
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:57,750
你被调去第12区做民兵
You were assigned to civil defense at the 12th district?

346
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,340

348
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,180
昨天才对我说…
Comrade Kruschev was telling me just yesterday...

349
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:07,820
我们极需要会德语的通讯员

350
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,220
不可以

351
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,130
我们的部队负责本区的安全
Our militia's responsible for all the people in this neighbourhood.

352
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,700
人手已经很短缺  那好办
We're already desperately short of men.

353
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:16,890
我们愿意用十二个士兵交换你
We'll give you a dozen soldiers for every one that speaks German.

354
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,730
我宁愿留下来作战
I'd rather stay and fight.

355
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:22,140
服务总部也是作战 你会更有用
Serving at headquarters is fighting. You'd be far more useful there.

356
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,270
你留下来 掩护我们
You stay here. You cover us.

357
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,440
好
All right.

358
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,050
我们去了
We go.

359
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,450

362
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:26,850
这是个圈套 我知道
It's a trap. I know.

363
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:53,160
撤退
Move back.

364
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:43,460
他还在这里
He's still here.

365
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,520
他们正轰炸过来！
They're coming straight for us!

366
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:14,660
露米娜 留在原地 他就在我们附近

367
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:28,110
我们得离开这里！

368
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,810
不走不行！
We have to get out of here!

369
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:34,210
不要动！
Just stay where you are!

370
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,480
怎办?  留在原地别动！
What are we gonna do? Ludmilla,stay where you are!

371
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,200
我不管！我要走了
Fuck this,I'm going.

372
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:58,910
露米娜 不要走！
Ludmilla,no!

373
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,160
上面写的是什么?
What does this mean?

374
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:58,960
瓦希里获发新的狙击枪
"The little shepherd from the Urals receives a new sniper's rifle,

375
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:03,800

376
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:07,690
苏联最得意的精良武器
Pride of precision Of Soviet production."

377
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:10,250
我看过那支枪 是吗?
一 I've seen that rifle close up. 一 Have you?

378
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:11,970
甚至摸过
I've even touched it.

379
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,850
我跟瓦希里很熟的…
I know him well,Vassili Zaitsev.

380
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,560

露米娜和安东今天死了

382

都是我的错
and it was my fault.

383
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:11,810
我肯定这不是事实
No,I'm sure that's not true.

384
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:14,040
冒出个德军狙击手
There was a German sniper.

385
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:16,910
我带他们中了他的圈套
I walked them right into his trap.

386
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:19,240
你还知道什么?
What else can you tell me?

387
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:20,780
他没有转移阵地
He didn't relocate.

388
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,850
狙击手不转移阵地…
A sniper who doesn't relocate

389
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:26,320
是不合常规的
isn't normal.

390
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,090
他很厉害
He was very good.

391
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:32,960
不仅枪法好 而且有很准的直觉
It wasn't just his shooting,it was his instinct.

392
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:36,000
他的行动往往比我早一步
He was a step ahead of me all the time.

393
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:40,030
那是因为他对你了如指掌
That's because he knows everything about you.

394
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:43,870
他叫康尼 康尼少校
His name is Konig, Major Konig.

395
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:45,600
德军派他来
They've sent him here

396
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:51,610
是为了杀…找你

397
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:00,150
我们起初不知道线报是否可靠
At first we weren't sure if the information was reliable.

398
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:03,160
他似乎专程从柏林来杀你
It seems he's come all the way from Berlin to stop you.

399
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:06,300
你令他们寝食难安 他们派高手来置你于死地
You've caused them so many sleepless nights,they sent their top marksman.

400
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:07,900

他是德军的少校

403
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:18,510

Koulikov studied under him at Zossen before the war.

404
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,770
很清楚他的伎俩
He knows all his tricks.

405
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:22,400
由现在起 你去哪里 他去哪里

来自巴伐利亚的猎鹿贵族
A nobleman from Bavaria who hunts deer...

407
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:30,090
跟来自乌拉尔的杀狼小子对决
against a shepherd boy from the Urals who poaches wolves.

408
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:33,890
这不仅是两国之战
It's more than a confrontation between two nations.

409
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:39,720
也标志着阶级斗争的精髓
It's the essence Of class struggle.

410
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,120
很高兴你这样兴奋
I'm glad you're so happy.

411
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,060
他占尽上风
He had all the advantages.

412
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,190
下次你会打平
Next time you'll be even.

413
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:49,830
你的枪法所向无敌
No one shoots like you,Vassili.

414
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,140
她被调职了
She's been transferred.

415
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:05,520
我去看看隔壁准备好了没有
I'll see if they're ready for you next door.

416
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:11,250
你好
Hello.

417
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,660
你穿上新制服好英俊
You look smart in your new uniform.

418
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:17,390
结束后别交还
Make sure they don't take it back once you've finished.

419
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:20,640
可能要交还
Yeah,they probably will.

420
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:27,710
我听过那德国人的事
I've heard the rumor about the German,

421
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:29,470
祝你好运
and I wanted to wish you luck.

422
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:31,910
谢谢 我现在很需要运气
Thank you. I'll need it.

423
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:34,380
丹尼洛夫同志说…
From what comrade Danilov tells me,

424
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:36,310
你稳操胜券
you're going to win.

425
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,300
Hmm.

426
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,290
是时候了
It's time.

427
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:49,140
瓦希里…这边！来拥抱一下
一  Vassili! Vassili! 一 Come to my arms.

428
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:52,630
望过来 瓦希里
Look in my direction.

429
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,540
戴着帽吧 这样更似英雄
Put your cap back on, you look more heroic.

430
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:57,870
这边 瓦希里同志
This way,comrade Zaitsev.

431
00:49:58,010 --> 00:49:59,140
这小伙子甚得我心！
I love this little fellow.

432
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,440
瓦希里 你真的自愿上前线?
Vassili,is it true that you volunteered for the front?

433
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:03,810
你几岁?
How old are you,Vassili?

434
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:05,750
你知道这对国家有多大意义吗?
Do you know what this duel means for our country?

435
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,150
你是不是五岁就杀狼?
Is it true you killed your first wolf when you were five?

436
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:10,190
你今天杀了多少德军?
Vassili,tell me how many officers had been kill today?

437
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,120
德国派神枪手对付你 你自豪吗
Are you proud to be challenged By the best sharpshooter in Germany?

438
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:15,020
这表示德国鬼开始怕我们了
The Germans are starting to shit their pants.

439
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:18,090
对他们讲你怎样对付他吧
Go on,my boy,tell us how you're going to deal with him.

440
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:20,200
还是别对他们讲 问多一个问题
一 Or rather,no.一 One more question,please.

441
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:21,920
对领袖讲吧！
Tell it to the boss.

442
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:24,800
他喜欢听追猎的故事
He likes good hunting stories.

443
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,140
挺起胸膛看着他
Look at him with pride,

444
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:35,680
因为他正看着你
because he's looking at you.

445
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:40,020
全国正看着你
The whole country is looking at you.

446
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:06,480
原谅我吧 爷爷
Forgive me,forgive me, Grandfather.

447
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:27,690
1942年10月23日

448
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:41,110
狩猎场不是由狼决定
So,it's not the wolf that chooses the hunting ground...

449
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:43,380
是由猎人决定的
but the hunter.

450
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:50,180
你爷爷必定教过你
But I'm sure your grandfather taught you that.

451
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:59,060
不过 今次我是猎物
Except in this case, I'm the game.

452
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:08,210
不管怎样 今天我们要引狼出窦
However, today what we're going to do... is lure the wolf out of his lair...

453
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:10,200
把狼引到我们要狼到的地方
to where we want him to be.

454
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:53,740
你的命值钱 你先跳
You're the one whose life is valuable. You go first.

455
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,680
不 我们轮流先跳
No,no. We take it in turns.

456
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:57,810
下次 轮到你先跳
Next time is your turn to go first,

457
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,350
然后轮到你 伏洛迪亚
and then it's you,Volodya.

458
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:18,010
混蛋
Son of a bitch!

459
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:19,940
滚开！
Get off!

460
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:23,470
这裤子是新的
These are new pants.

461
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:27,640
我昨天才从一名队长身上脱下来
I just took them Off a captain from the 25 1st yesterday.

462
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,520
我在德国的佐森…
Sixteen months I spent in Germany

463
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:36,220
待了16个月
at the school in Zossen.

464
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:39,630
当然那时我们还没跟德国佬交恶
Of course,those were the days when we were friends with the Krauts,:

465
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:44,300
我们的斯大林跟他们的希特勒
when our Joseph and their Adolph...

466
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,670
当时还在称兄道弟
were walking hand in hand.

467
00:53:48,610 --> 00:53:51,340
这里离电线有160米吧?
From here to the wire, 160meters,right?

468
00:53:57,050 --> 00:53:58,810
155
155… One hundred and fifty-five.

469
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:00,110
无所谓
Whatever.

470
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,050
这一来 他们要派人来修理
That'll make 'em Send out a repair guy.

471
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:05,520
转移阵地吧
Let's relocate.

472
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:15,560
Aah!

473
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:28,510
伏洛迪亚！
Hey,Volodya!

474
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,320
德国侵略我们之后…
After the Germans invaded us,

475
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:44,160
气氛完全不同了
it wasn't the same atmosphere anymore.

476
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:48,060
我无辜给人抓去坐牢
Threw my ass in prison.

477
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:50,760
“你去德国做什么?”
What were you doing in Germany,huh?

478
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:55,500
我答：抱歉 斯大林同志派我去
Excuse me,says I,but it was comrade Stalin who sent me there.

479
00:54:55,870 --> 00:55:00,280
不要诋毁我们伟大的领袖
Don't bring our glorious leader into your treachery.

480
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:03,810
认罪吧 奸细
Confess,spy bastard! Confess.

481
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:04,940
跟着…
And bang! Bang,bang,bang!

482
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,360
他们拿出的不是镰刀 是铁锤
Well,there wasn't a sickle, but there was a hammer.

483
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:16,720
跟着…
And bang.

484
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:19,290
把我的牙统统敲掉
Knocked out all my teeth.

485
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:24,940
对了 小伙子 不要心存幻想
That's right,boy. Have no illusions.

486
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:29,370
这就是社会主义的天堂
That's the land of socialism and universal bliss for you.

487
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,780
维修的人来了！
Hey! It's your repair guy.

488
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:39,250
我瞄准了
I got him.

489
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:55,080
该喝汤了吧?
It's about soup time, isn't it?

490
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,870
我去拿
I'm going.

491
00:55:57,870 --> 00:56:00,360
那还不去?伏洛迪亚
Well,get a move on,Volodya,

492
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:05,270
不要倒泄 你这马克思混蛋
and try not to spill it all on your way back,you Marxist bastard.

493
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:22,990
这是过去一天敌军的狙击记录
The enemy sniper activity reported during the past 24 hours,Herr Major.

494
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:28,760
火车站的两名哨兵被杀害
Two sentries shot in the train station sector.

495
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,490
北区一名大炮观察员遇害

One lieutenant from the 24th Panzer division in the factory sector.

497
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:38,870
工人宿舍三名通讯工兵
Three telephone repairmen in the workers' housing sector.

498
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:43,450
我们抓到战俘 你或者会感兴趣
They also tell me we have just taken a prisoner who may interest you.

499
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:45,580
但愿他能开口
I hope he's still able to speak.

500
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,010
什么?少校
Excuse me,sir?

501
00:56:47,850 --> 00:56:50,340
没什么 谢谢
Nothing. Thank you.

502
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:58,250
伏洛迪亚 他在哪幢楼内?
So,tell us,Volodya, which building is he in?

503
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:03,390
我不可能知道
There is no way I know that.

504
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:06,900
他不断走来走去
He moves around all the time.

505
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:09,600
从一幢楼跳去另一幢
He jumps from one to the next.

506
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:11,300
在哪一层?
On which floor?

507
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:13,710
不知道
I don't know.

508
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,740
我们很快会知道
We'll see about that.

509
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:18,880
把他的衣服脱掉
Undress him.

510
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:21,680
给他穿上我们的军服
Put him in one of our uniforms.

511
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:53,740
瞧 还真倔
You see,they are stubborn.

512
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,640
这是德国人的优点
That's the good thing about the Germans.

513
00:57:57,020 --> 00:58:01,290
你得承认 假如他们打定主意…
Man,you got to admit when they get an idea in their heads一

514
00:58:16,470 --> 00:58:18,030
好
Right.

515
00:58:18,610 --> 00:58:23,910
看看顾客来了没有 准备好了吗
Let's see if our customer has arrived. Are you ready?

516
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,960
Uh一huh.

517
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:30,110
康尼少校眼中的白痴
And now our famous shepherd from the Urals,

518
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:32,220
我们有名的乌拉尔牧羊人
who Major Konig thinks is an idiot,

519
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:35,790
站了起来 看看自己是否击中了目标
gets up to make sure he has hit his target.

520
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:38,430
康尼少校看到他
Major Konig sees him.

521
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:44,430
瞄准他的头盔…
Aims for his helmet.

522
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:46,470
开枪
Fires.

523
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,800
他暴露了自己的位置
Reveals his position

524
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:51,430
反而被射死了
And is shot in turn.

525
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,280
可是…
Except...

526
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:05,620
康尼少校并没有开枪
Major Konig doesn't fire...

527
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:12,620
因为康尼少校并不在
because Major Konig isn't there.

528
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,990
科里哥夫
Koulikov!

529
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:27,540
你不觉得刚才很奇怪吗?
Don't you think that was strange, that last one?

530
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,880
他们明知出来就要被射死
They sent him out to get shot like the others.

531
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:32,900
这很不寻常
It's not natural.

532
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:36,740
却依然派人出来 而且不掩护他
Not without artillery, without trying to cover him.

533
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:41,150
我才是蠢的那个
Oh,no,I'm the one who was stupid.

534
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:43,920
他们才不在乎通讯兵的死活
They don't give a shit about telephone guys.

535
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:46,390
就像我们对待乌克兰人一样
I mean,it's like us with the Ukrainians.

536
00:59:46,530 --> 00:59:50,230
死几个乌克兰佬 我们眉也不皱
They'd never bother a major over a few dead grunts.

537
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:55,400
我们明天杀几个将军吧
Tomorrow,we'll kill us some generals.

538
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:05,340
轮到谁?
Whose turn is it?

539
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:08,080
似乎轮到我
Mine,I think.

540
01:00:09,390 --> 01:00:11,720
骗人！
Oh,you're such a cheater!

541
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:15,440
想骗科里哥夫叔叔?妄想
You can't fool Papa Koulikov.

542
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:19,390
轮到我先跳
No,no,no,no,no,no,no, it's my turn to go first.

543
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,730
轮到你的裤子被射穿
And it's your turn to get a hole in your britches.

544
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,080
祝我们胜利！
To victory.

545
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:54,380
狙击决斗的事拖得太久了
This sniper business has been dragging on too long.

546
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:57,850
你那小子有什么进展?
What's that little fellow of yours up to?

547
01:01:59,930 --> 01:02:02,160
他在试探 赫鲁晓夫同志
He's probing, comrade Kruschev.

548
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:04,430
试探那德国人的弱点
He's testing the Germans for weaknesses.

549
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:07,770
他做事一丝不苟
He's meticulous in his preparation.

550
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:13,970
伏特加这种奢侈品 我们有
Vodka... is a luxury we have.

551
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:17,340
鱼子酱这种奢侈品 我们有
Caviar is a luxury we have.

552
01:02:17,550 --> 01:02:20,180
时间 我们没有
Time is not.

553
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:23,820
这点他明白 赫鲁晓夫同志 我俩都明白
He's aware of that comrade Kruschev. We both are.

554
01:02:25,790 --> 01:02:30,130
我保证他会成功 好
I assure you he will succeed. Good.

555
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:33,890
你俩的命运息息相关
It seems your destinies are entwined.

556
01:02:56,450 --> 01:02:57,980
你相当忙
They're keeping you busy.

557
01:03:03,890 --> 01:03:05,380
我在厨房捡来
I picked this up in the kitchen.

558
01:03:05,530 --> 01:03:07,660
这是前几天的招待会剩下来的 
It's from the reception the other day. 

559
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:10,765
我想费太太会喜欢 
I thought Mrs.Filipov might like it.

560
01:03:10,766 --> 01:03:13,730
她会很高兴 你真好
Um,she will be thrilled. That's very sweet of you.

561
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:17,970
你饿的话 还有很多
There's plenty more If you're hungry.

562
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:20,010
你是犹太教的吧?
You're Jewish, aren't you?

563
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:24,340
我们的宗教并不禁止吃鲟鱼
There's nothing in our religion that says you can't eat sturgeon.

564
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:28,980
我爸爸早已预感到这会发生
My father had a premonition all this would happen.

565
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,110
你指预感到战事?
You mean the war?

566
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:35,520
他知道大家一向都仇恨犹太人
He understood that the hatred of the jews ran deep.

567
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:39,150
他在储蓄 打算到巴勒斯坦买地
He was saving up to buy some land in Palestine.

568
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:43,930
还说那儿才是属于我们的地方
He said it was the only land we truly belonged in;

569
01:03:44,370 --> 01:03:47,570
那儿才值得我们保卫
the only land we had a duty to defend.

570
01:03:48,310 --> 01:03:51,640
他一定要我学开枪
He insisted learn to use a rifle.

571
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:54,210
于是我学会了
I learned to shoot.

572
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:00,010
我知道打仗时
I know that in times of war,

573
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:02,950
个人感情要放在一旁
personal feelings should be put aside,but...

574
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:05,610
但我想请你帮忙
I have a favor to ask you.

575
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,120
没问题 尽管说
Of course. Anything you want.

576
01:04:08,590 --> 01:04:10,750
我想调职
I want to be reassigned.

577
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,490
丹尼娅 怎么了?
What's happened,Tania?

578
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:42,550
他射死了科里哥夫
He shot him.

579
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:49,190
第一个跳 也被打死了
He shot him even though he jumped first.

580
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:52,930
跳过去时中弹
Shot him on the run.

581
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:57,670
神乎其技 我没见过人这样厉害
It was an impossible shot. I've never seen anything like it.

582
01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:01,140
你作出的胜利承诺 我没法兑现
You've promised people a victory I can't deliver.

583
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:05,850
我不是他的对手 毫无胜算
I don't stand a chance against this man.

584
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:08,110
你不可以这样说
You mustn't talk like that,Vassili.

585
01:05:09,590 --> 01:05:13,020
我们有办法追踪到他的行动
What if I told you we found a way to track his movements?

586
01:05:13,490 --> 01:05:15,480
我们有探子
We've got someone,Vassili.

587
01:05:15,790 --> 01:05:18,630
那探子很接近他
Someone close to him passing us information.

588
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:22,460
下次你的行动会比他早一步
Next time you will be one step ahead of him.

589
01:05:23,870 --> 01:05:25,160
我保证
I promise.

590
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:38,240
现在我想请你帮个忙
Now I have a favor to ask.

591
01:05:39,050 --> 01:05:40,540
求我?
From me?

592
01:05:43,790 --> 01:05:45,690
关于丹尼娅的
It's about Tania.

593
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:52,830
进来
Come in.

594
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,200
他甚至不知道你存在…
He doesn't even know you exist.

595
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:03,770
但那一刻 你比任何人更接近他
But at that moment,you are closer to him than anyone else on earth.

596
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:07,000
你通过瞄准器清楚看到他的脸
You see his face through the sight.

597
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:09,540
看得出他早上有没有剃须…
You see whether he shaved that morning or not.

598
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:13,780
有没有戴戒指 有没有家室
You can see whether he's married by whether he has a wedding ring on.

599
01:06:15,790 --> 01:06:18,720
你要将狙击的…
It's not like...

600
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:21,760
不是死物 也不是仅仅一套军服
just firing at a distant shape, not just a uniform.

601
01:06:21,890 --> 01:06:23,790
而是人的脸
It's a man's face.

602
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:27,090
你会永远记得那些脸
Those faces don't go away.

603
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:33,570
会在你的脑海里浮现 一张张新的脸孔会不停地更替
They come back and they just-they get replaced by more faces.

604
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:36,540
丹尼洛夫叫你来说这一番话?
Did Danilov ask you to tell me this?

605
01:06:36,770 --> 01:06:40,610
他喜欢你 想尽力改变你的主意
He likes you very much. I think he'd try anything to change your mind.

606
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:43,410
他有没有说我为什么想调职?
Did he tell you why I asked for the transfer?

607
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:44,940
没有
No.

608
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:48,110
今早总部接到一份名单
This morning,a list arrived at headquarters.

609
01:06:48,290 --> 01:06:50,980
是一批三个星期前…
It was a list of civilians who'd been...

610
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:56,580
从斯大林格勒押解去德国的平民
rounded up and sent to Germany in a convoy... that left Stalingrad three weeks ago.

611
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:00,390
我父母当时身在其中
My parents were amongst them.

612
01:07:02,530 --> 01:07:05,760
火车驶了30公里
After 30 kilometers, the German soldiers...

613
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:11,170
停下来 德军把所有人赶下车
stopped the train and forced everyone out.

614
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:17,210
在桥中央 德军把大家绑起
In the middle of a bridge, they bound them together,

615
01:07:17,350 --> 01:07:19,250
绑成一对对
two by two.

616
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:25,250
母与女、夫与妻
Mothers with daughters. Husbands and wives.

617
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:30,880
德军叫那些人在桥边排队
They... lined them up against the railing,

618
01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:36,560
然后每一对开一枪 以节省子弹
and then they fired a single shot at each pair... to save bullets.

619
01:07:37,770 --> 01:07:39,700
这方法奏效
It worked.

620
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:45,200
中弹的那个把另一个拖进水里
The bodies of the ones who died dragged the others under the water.

621
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,810
我知道他们死在一起
I know they died together.

622
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:54,950
他们再也不会分开
They never would have let themselves be separated.

623
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:14,130
这是科里哥夫的步枪 性能很好
That's Koulikov's rifle. It's a good... rifle.

624
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:25,080
谢谢
Thank you.

625
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:56,740
我知道他怎样离开防空洞
I know how he leaves the shelter.

626
01:08:57,310 --> 01:08:59,210
他穿过拖拉机厂
He goes through the tractor factory.

627
01:08:59,350 --> 01:09:01,680
拖拉机厂很大的
The tractor factory is big.

628
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:06,750
我清楚知道他走的路径
I know exactly where.

629
01:09:06,890 --> 01:09:10,580
他沿着大桶铁格下的沟渠… 一直往前爬
He crawls through a gutter,under a grate where the vats are,

630
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:13,060
然后从工场走出来
then he goes out from the workshop.

631
01:09:13,330 --> 01:09:15,730
其中有一段路没有掩护
In between the two, there's a place where he's in the open.

632
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:18,800
那一段路在铁长廊之下
It's under a long,iron foot walk.

633
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:34,410
1942年11月5日

634
01:09:52,970 --> 01:09:54,630
祝你好运 同志
Good luck,comrade.

635
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:43,070
我知道他会在哪里等候我
I know exactly where he's waiting for me.

636
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:48,440
在沟渠上的铁长廊
He'll be on the foot walk over the gutter.

637
01:11:48,590 --> 01:11:51,580
我们从后面袭击他
We'll take him out from behind.

638
01:12:11,170 --> 01:12:16,370
我们沿着喉管 走去工场另一边
We'll get to the other end of the workshop through these pipes.

639
01:12:16,510 --> 01:12:18,070
跟我来！
Follow me.

640
01:14:04,290 --> 01:14:05,750
你从那边去
You go that way. I'll go around this way.

641
01:14:05,890 --> 01:14:10,120
我从这边绕过去 好的
Okay?

642
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:27,670
糟糕！
Shit!

643
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:36,980
不要紧
Sergei, you should go back.

644
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:41,760
你应该回去!  不 我不会有事
一 Go back. 一 No,I'll be all right.

645
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,420
不 回去！
No,you go!

646
01:14:48,830 --> 01:14:50,770
把腿缩进去
Keep your legs in.

647
01:15:33,740 --> 01:15:38,840
来吧
Come on. Come on. Come on.

648
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:40,800
斯大林同志要你们拼尽全力
Comrade Stalin is asking for one last effort!

649
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:42,670
祖国的命运危在旦夕
The fate of the motherland is at risk!

650
01:16:42,810 --> 01:16:45,510
你们所珍爱的人也危在旦夕
The fate of all those you love and cherish!

651
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:48,180
我们今天要为他们奋战
It's for them that we fight today.

652
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:50,910
听我劝吧 丹尼娅
Listen to me,Tania.

653
01:16:51,050 --> 01:16:53,350
德国向我们发动大举攻击
The Germans are throwing everything at us.

654
01:16:53,490 --> 01:16:56,650
十个士兵中只有一个能活着回来
If they're lucky,one in ten of these soldiers will come back alive.

655
01:16:56,790 --> 01:16:59,390
你受过高等教育 通晓外语
You're highly educated. You know languages.

656
01:16:59,530 --> 01:17:02,970
你截听、解读情报
Every intercept you translate saves hundreds of lives.

657
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:06,930
能拯救许多同胞 亦能杀敌无数
Every message you decode kills thousands of theirs.

658
01:17:07,070 --> 01:17:09,160
你有责任活下去
You have a duty to survive.

659
01:17:09,310 --> 01:17:12,000
瓦希里擅长开枪 是天生的枪手
Vassili was born to fire a gun. It's what he knows.

660
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:15,510
你我却另有作用
You and I were born for a different purpose.

661
01:17:16,050 --> 01:17:19,010
瓦希里也会对你说同一番话
If Vassili were here, he would tell you the same thing.

662
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:25,180
他在哪里?瓦希里在哪里?
Where is he? Where is Vassili?

663
01:18:32,860 --> 01:18:34,880
把头伏下 告诉我枪手在哪里
Keep your head down.Tell me where he is.

664
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:40,150
躲在管内 丹妮娅 不要出来 把头缩起
Stay into that pipe,Tania. Stay in. Stay in! Get your head in!

665
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:51,570
慢慢来 不要开枪
Slow down. Don't shoot.

666
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:58,310
他在那里
He's over there.

667
01:19:11,130 --> 01:19:15,590
见到你前面的柱子吗?
Do you see the pillar in front of you?

668
01:19:16,170 --> 01:19:19,600
我要你到柱子的后面去
I need you to move round behind it.

669
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:30,300
去吧
Go.

670
01:19:32,210 --> 01:19:38,020
我要你找一大块玻璃
Tania,I need you to find a large piece of glass.

671
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:40,280
一块玻璃?
Piece of glass.

672
01:19:43,030 --> 01:19:46,120
我后面工厂的左边…
Do you see the kiln...

673
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:49,960
有座窖 看得见吗?
behind me to the left of the factory?

674
01:19:52,270 --> 01:19:54,170
看不看得见?我听不到
Yes? I can't hear you.

675
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:57,270
看见 看见
一 Yes. 一 Yes.

676
01:19:57,470 --> 01:20:03,250
看见两扇百叶窗吗?
Do you see... the two louvers?

677
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:06,710
看见 看不看得见…
一 Yes. 一 Do you see the one...

678
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:12,180
破了百叶板的那一扇?  看见
with a broken slat? Yes.

679
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:14,580
我要你这么做
This is what I want you to do.

680
01:20:21,230 --> 01:20:24,260
准备好了吗?  准备好了
一 Are you ready? 一 Yes.

681
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:28,000
三…二…
Three... two... one...

682
01:20:47,060 --> 01:20:48,720
你好 沙夏
Hello,Sacha.

683
01:20:55,630 --> 01:20:57,690
他真的去那地方了
He was right where you said he'd be.

684
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,500
差不多说中
Nearly there.

685
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:06,540
他很聪明
He's very clever.

686
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:13,350
跟我说说他
Tell me about him.

687
01:21:20,060 --> 01:21:24,360
为何不是爸爸而是爷爷教他开枪
Why was it his grandfather taught him how to shoot and not his father?

688
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:28,420
他爸爸死了 妈妈也死了
His father's dead. His mother too.

689
01:21:31,370 --> 01:21:33,200
他有没有提起爸爸?
Does he talk about his father?

690
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:35,800
不提 他不认识爸爸
No. He didn't know him.

691
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:39,530
他有上过学吗?
Did he go to school?

692
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:43,580
他懂得写字 回很多信
He knows how to write. He answers lots of letters.

693
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:47,280
女孩的信?
Hmm. Is it girls who write to him?

694
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:49,310
人人都写信给他
Everyone writes to him.

695
01:21:49,450 --> 01:21:51,580
他在家乡有没有喜欢的女孩?
Is there a girl he loves in his village?

696
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:53,380
不是在家乡 在这里
Not in his village,here.

697
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:55,180
那女孩喜欢他吗?
Does she love him?

698
01:21:55,690 --> 01:21:58,130
喜欢 因为他英俊
Yes,because he's handsome.

699
01:21:58,260 --> 01:22:01,660
因为他勇敢 那女孩很漂亮
Because he's brave and she's very beautiful.

700
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,890
我跟她很熟 她是我邻居

701
01:22:04,030 --> 01:22:05,860
她上过大学

702
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,100
他们郎才女貌 将来会结婚
They're handsome together.Later,the two of them will get married.

703
01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:17,810
起码我是这么想的
At least,I think so.

704
01:22:19,580 --> 01:22:21,280
而你呢?沙夏…
And you,Sacha,

705
01:22:23,190 --> 01:22:25,620
你为什么帮德国人?
why are you helping the Germans?

706
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:32,490
因为德国人比较强 会打胜仗
Because they're stronger. Because they're going to win the war.

707
01:22:32,630 --> 01:22:35,120
也因为你爱吃朱古力
And because you like chocolate,huh?

708
01:22:52,150 --> 01:22:54,910
这些人知道自己活不久
All these people here know they're gonna die.

709
01:22:55,050 --> 01:22:57,210
晚上能够活着回来…
So each night when they make it back,

710
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:00,150
算是赚了一天
It's a bonus.

711
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:02,880
对不起
Excuse me.

712
01:23:03,860 --> 01:23:05,590
于是 每一杯茶…
So,every cup of tea,

713
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:07,830
每一根香烟…
every cigarette...

714
01:23:09,570 --> 01:23:11,690
都成了小小的庆祝
becomes a little celebration.

715
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:15,360
因为这可能是我们的最后一晚
Because for a lot of us, it maybe our last night.

716
01:23:16,410 --> 01:23:19,860
你在这儿要接受这事实
It's just something you have to accept here.

717
01:23:20,910 --> 01:23:22,740
人难免一死
Everyone has their time.

718
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:31,040
在森林里 狼只活三年
In the forest, the wolf lives for three years,

719
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:33,190
驴则活九年
the donkey for nine.

720
01:23:36,290 --> 01:23:40,130
抱歉！这必定是乌拉尔的俗语
So,that's一 that's got to be a proverb from the Urals.

721
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:41,920
我认为没有道理
It makes no sense to me whatsoever.

722
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:45,900
驴活得长 因为它有用处
The donkey lives longer because he's more useful.

723
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:47,360
这绝对有道理
Makes absolute sense.

724
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:49,870
森林里哪里有驴?
There aren't any donkeys in the forest.

725
01:23:50,010 --> 01:23:51,530
你虚构出来的
You made it up.

726
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:58,080
那么…我是头驴吗?
So... I'm a donkey?

727
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:06,110
你和丹尼洛夫这种人得活下来
People like you and Danilov... have to survive this.

728
01:24:06,260 --> 01:24:09,520
你们读过书 受过教育
People who have read books, had an education.

729
01:24:11,060 --> 01:24:13,490
战后重建 需要你们
We'll need you when the war is over.

730
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:15,350
假如你能活下来呢?
And if you survive?

731
01:24:16,170 --> 01:24:20,360
“无用”的瓦希里会做什么?
What will the useless Vassili Zaitsev do then?

732
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:22,770
我想在工厂干活
I wanna work in a factory.

733
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:27,440
爷爷带我进过工厂一次
My granddad took me to a factory once.

734
01:24:28,510 --> 01:24:35,380
高处的铁走廊上… 站着一个人
There was this man there, high up on a-on a foot walk.

735
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:38,350
他与众不同 不穿蓝工作服
He wasn't wearing blue like the others.

736
01:24:38,890 --> 01:24:40,190
他手下的工人…
The people he was supervising

737
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:44,830
都不明白自己做什么 不过…
didn't really understand what they were doing. But for him,

738
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:48,160
他高高在上 就那么简单 一切了如指掌
for him up there, it was simple; it was clear.

739
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:50,390
我希望自己有朝一日…
And I thought,"One day,

740
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,760
能成为那个人
I could be that man."

741
01:24:59,110 --> 01:25:02,840
拥有不能实现的梦想 真难过
Sad to have a dream you know won't happen.

742
01:25:04,510 --> 01:25:06,280
为什么不可能实现?
Why shouldn't it?

743
01:25:08,850 --> 01:25:12,710
你会长命百岁
You'll outlive us all. Hmm.

744
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:15,920
你会成为森林里最老的驴
You'll be the oldest donkey in the forest.

745
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:35,640
德军离伏尔加河有150米
"150 meters stand between the Germans and the Volga.

746
01:25:35,810 --> 01:25:38,280
这举世瞩目的150米…
"Today the whole world is watching these 150meters.

747
01:25:38,450 --> 01:25:40,010
使斯大林格勒成为…
They are what makes Stalingrad..."

748
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,810
战争的…
the capitol...

749
01:25:43,490 --> 01:25:45,040
首都
of the war.

750
01:25:50,330 --> 01:25:52,660
你的朋友丹尼娅…
Your friend,Tania...

751
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:55,560
你有没有见过她?
have you see her?

752
01:25:56,270 --> 01:25:59,670
她跟狙击队的人在一起
She stays over there now, with the snipers.

753
01:26:00,270 --> 01:26:06,130
告诉少校所有狙击手会进攻工厂
Tell the major we're sending in all of our sharpshooters... to support the attack on the factory.

754
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:10,440
瓦希里也会参与
Tell him Vassili will be there.

755
01:30:01,310 --> 01:30:03,970
我要跟你谈谈 好
一 I need to talk to you. 一 Sure.

756
01:30:08,420 --> 01:30:10,080
丹尼洛夫   嗯
一 Danilov. 一 Hmm?

757
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:25,590
别再写我了
You have to stop writing about me.

758
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,770
我根本不是他对手
I'm not gonna get him because I'm not good enough.

759
01:30:31,910 --> 01:30:35,210
他迟早会找到我 会杀掉我
Sooner or later,he's gonna find me, he's gonna kill me.

760
01:30:35,410 --> 01:30:37,810
我警告过你 不准说丧气话
I've warned you before not to talk like this.

761
01:30:40,150 --> 01:30:42,080
今次不同
This time it's different.

762
01:30:44,820 --> 01:30:47,410
你把我吹嘘得
You've built me up...

763
01:30:47,590 --> 01:30:51,050
也过于伟大了
and up into someone I'm not.

764
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:55,460
我受不了这份量 我想作战
I can't carry that weight anymore. I wanna fight.

765
01:30:56,530 --> 01:31:01,060
像普通士兵那样作战
I want to fight just as a regular soldier.

766
01:31:01,370 --> 01:31:02,930
我明白
I understand.

767
01:31:03,210 --> 01:31:07,110
但你不是普通士兵 你很出色
The thing is,you're not a regular soldier. You're extraordinary soldier.

768
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:09,470
那只是你编造出来
No,I'm what you've made me.

769
01:31:10,950 --> 01:31:13,010
仅此而已
Nothing more.

770
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:19,810
为什么现在说这番话?
Why are you telling me this now?

771
01:31:21,290 --> 01:31:23,160
发生了什么事?
Hmm? What's happened?

772
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,990
有什么改变了?
What's changed?

773
01:31:33,270 --> 01:31:35,260
你有没有替我劝劝丹尼娅?
Did you speak to Tania for me?

774
01:31:38,010 --> 01:31:39,340
有   那么..
一 Yes. 一 Well...

775
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:42,840
她肯回心转意吗?
will she reconsider?

776
01:31:45,810 --> 01:31:47,680
不知道
I don't know.

777
01:31:50,650 --> 01:31:54,210
为了安全 她应该回心转意
She should. She'll be much safer. She should,you know that.

778
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:55,310
是的
Yeah.

779
01:31:55,420 --> 01:31:57,920
她调职比你容易
It'll be easier to get her reassigned.

780
01:31:58,190 --> 01:32:01,360
德军准备再进攻市中心
The Germans are preparing another offensive in the city center.

781
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:04,470
我们很需要利用你去激励军心
The propaganda battle is crucial for morale. We need you more than ever.

782
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:06,590
沙夏！

783
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:12,600
把你的消息告诉他
Tell him what you know,Sacha.

784
01:32:12,740 --> 01:32:14,070
沙夏 你好
Hello,Sacha.

785
01:32:14,380 --> 01:32:16,280
少校的军靴沾了尘
There was dust on the major's boots.

786
01:32:16,410 --> 01:32:20,070
少校以为沙夏投靠了敌方
Sacha has the major convinced he's gone over to the other side.

787
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:23,870
不用我说 你也知他要冒多大险
I don't need to tell you the risk she's taking.

788
01:32:24,020 --> 01:32:25,180
尘是黄色的
The dust was yellow.

789
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:28,634
全市只有化工厂后面的…
There's only one place where there's dust like that-

790
01:32:28,635 --> 01:32:31,120
小径旁有一大堆黄尘
in the back of the chemical factory, a big heap on the tracks.

791
01:32:32,650 --> 01:32:35,030
干得好

792
01:32:35,730 --> 01:32:37,220

到外面等我
wait for me outside then.

794
01:32:46,780 --> 01:32:48,210
丹尼洛夫 嗯
一 Danilov, 一 Hmm?

795
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:53,180
你无权利用他
you had no right to use him.

796
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:55,310
我没有利用他
No,no,I didn't use him.

797
01:32:55,450 --> 01:32:58,980
他是自愿的
Vassili, he did it of his own accord.

798
01:32:59,150 --> 01:33:00,850
你知道原因吗?
You know why?

799
01:33:01,220 --> 01:33:04,280
因为他信任你
Because he believes in you!

800
01:33:10,970 --> 01:33:14,230
明早我们就会收复化工厂
Tomorrow morning,we're going to take back the chemical factory.

沙夏通知了少校你会去
Sacha's informed the major you'll be there,

802
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:20,600
你知道应该在哪里埋伏他
so now you know where you have to wait for him.

803
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:21,830
在突击途中
In the middle of an assault.

804
01:33:21,980 --> 01:33:26,470
我奉命行事 建议你也一样

805
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:30,350
我知道要冒险
Now,I'm aware of the risks.

806
01:33:31,050 --> 01:33:32,750
你会没事的
You'll be fine.

807
01:33:38,060 --> 01:33:39,690
同志
Comrade.

808
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:10,020
那边现在是德军 昨天是俄军的
That's the Germans up there. And yesterday was the Russians.

809
01:34:10,190 --> 01:34:11,750
我们快到了
We're not very far now.

810
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:15,820
沙夏
Sacha...

811
01:34:17,230 --> 01:34:19,600
你在玩很危险的游戏
you're playing a very dangerous game.

812
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:22,530
我想你打胜仗
I want you to win.

813
01:34:23,970 --> 01:34:27,370
看到吗?沿着河一直走去
See there? Keep going along the river.

814
01:34:27,510 --> 01:34:30,480
那里很安全…暂时
It's safe... for a while.

815
01:38:45,020 --> 01:38:47,940
Aah!

816
01:39:08,820 --> 01:39:10,150
他死了
He's dead.

817

我们在他尸体上找到的
We found this on his corpse.

818
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:19,490
你再没必要留下来
Your reason for being here has ceased to exist.

819
01:39:19,630 --> 01:39:21,600
请原谅 将军阁下
Pardon me,Herr General,

820
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:24,210
但我不相信…
but I do not believe一

821
01:39:24,210 --> 01:39:29,190
明晚有飞机往柏林 你要上机
There is a plane bound for Berlin tomorrow evening. You will be on it.

822
01:39:32,180 --> 01:39:35,950
登机前 你必须交出军牌来
Until then,I must ask you for your dog tags.

823
01:39:37,350 --> 01:39:40,950
万一你死掉 俄军就会趁机大肆宣传
Imagine how Russian propaganda would profit from your death.

824
01:39:41,090 --> 01:39:43,850
你死 就要死得无声无息
If you fall, you will fall unknown.

825
01:39:43,990 --> 01:39:46,460
你曾经差点没命
You've already had a near miss.

826
01:39:55,100 --> 01:39:58,070
另外 请收下这十字勋章
Also please take this War Merit Cross.

827
01:39:58,210 --> 01:40:02,140
是追颁给第116步兵师一名上尉
It was awarded posthumously... to a lieutenant of the 116th Infantry Division...

828
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:05,680
开战不久 他在这里为国捐躯
who fell here during the first days of the battle.

829
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:08,970
他是我的儿子
He was my son.

830
01:40:11,390 --> 01:40:14,650
码头一失守 万事俱休！
If the landing is captured, everything's lost!

831
01:40:16,930 --> 01:40:18,650
过来！
Come here.

832
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:26,690
我警告过你 你玩得太多花样！
What did I tell you? You've been playing your fiddle too much!

833
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:29,410
假如证实他归西 我们就会完蛋
If it's confirmed that he's dead,we're sunk!

834
01:40:29,410 --> 01:40:33,240
你会完蛋！  这不是真的
一 Well,you're sunk. 一 It isn't true.

835
01:40:33,370 --> 01:40:36,130
这是从他们的参谋部截获的
It was intercepted from their staff headquarters.

836
01:40:36,130 --> 01:40:39,840
他们还想怎么样 难道要他们把尸体吊起你才信?
What do they have to do, dangle his body in front of our men?

837
01:40:39,980 --> 01:40:41,540
他们在说谎
They're lying.

838
01:40:42,350 --> 01:40:46,220
好 很好
That's good. Very good.

839
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:50,220
这样写吧：瓦希里并没有死
Write it,then. "Vassili Zaitsev is not dead.

840
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:52,590
今早他吃这些早餐
"This is what he had for breakfast this morning.

841
01:40:52,730 --> 01:40:55,890
这是他今早看报的照片
This is a picture of him reading today's newspaper.

842
01:40:56,030 --> 01:40:57,500
随便作吧
" You're the poet".

843
01:40:57,730 --> 01:40:58,960
什么?
What?

844
01:40:59,100 --> 01:41:01,800
不准弃守河畔！
You won't give up the riverbank!

845
01:41:02,170 --> 01:41:04,950
已经死掉一半士兵?我不管！
I don't  care if you're lost half your men!

846
01:41:04,950 --> 01:41:08,470
继续防守 不然就是你自己死掉
Lose the other half, or lose yourself!

847
01:41:14,450 --> 01:41:15,880
他回来没?
Is he back?

848
01:41:19,290 --> 01:41:20,950
就快回来了
He should be back soon.

849
01:41:21,790 --> 01:41:25,280
德军切断路线 所以他才迟了
The German attack cut the lines. That's why he's late.

850
01:41:28,660 --> 01:41:30,460
我们出去一下好吗?
Can we go outside?

851
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:38,760
我写信向母亲谈起你
I wrote to my mother about you.

852
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:41,600
她说 战事结束之后
She wanted me to tell you that once this war was over,

853
01:41:41,940 --> 01:41:43,670
无论你有什么需要…
if there's anything you needed anything at all

854
01:41:43,810 --> 01:41:46,250
我们一家都会帮你
our family will be there for you.

855
01:41:48,620 --> 01:41:50,640
你知道我是为你的
You know I'm here for you.

856
01:41:55,690 --> 01:41:57,990
他们说瓦希里已经死了
They're saying Vassili is dead.

857
01:41:58,130 --> 01:42:02,090
瓦希里再也见不到亲人了
Vassili Zaitsev will never see his loved ones again.

858
01:42:02,230 --> 01:42:05,530
投降吧！这是唯一生路！
Surrender! This is your only hope.

859
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:12,040
你难过?
You're upset.

860
01:42:13,340 --> 01:42:15,610
因为瓦希里死了?
Because Zaitsev is dead?

861
01:42:17,580 --> 01:42:20,840
不用掩饰 不用难为情
You don't have to hide it. There's no shame in it.

862
01:42:21,550 --> 01:42:24,070
你跟他一样是俄罗斯人
You're a Russian like he is.

863
01:42:26,820 --> 01:42:28,580
不要听他们说
Don't listen to them.

864
01:42:29,220 --> 01:42:31,380
这只是宣传
It's just propaganda.

865
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:34,190
他没有死
He isn't dead.

866
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:37,130
你知道原因吗?
And do you know why?

867
01:42:38,730 --> 01:42:41,130
因为我还没有杀死他
Because I haven't killed him yet.

868
01:42:48,580 --> 01:42:50,910
告诉你一个秘密吧
I'm going to tell you a little secret.

869
01:42:51,180 --> 01:42:54,710
我只告诉你 因为我信得过你
Only you,because I know I can trust you.

870
01:42:54,850 --> 01:42:59,120
不过 你要发誓保密
But you must swear to me that you won't tell another soul.

871
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:02,280
愿意发誓吗?
You swear?

872
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:06,090
我找到一个绝佳地点
I found a terrific spot.

873
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:09,620
是火车站的出口旁边
It's by the exit from the train station.

874
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:12,200
我会躲在水塔里面
I'll hide in the water tower.

875
01:43:12,500 --> 01:43:15,370
明天 我在那儿候他
Tomorrow. I'll wait for him there.

876
01:43:15,370 --> 01:43:20,670
他一定会来 你等着瞧吧
You'll see. He'll be there.

877
01:43:20,810 --> 01:43:23,400
他一直都会出现
He always is.

878
01:43:32,590 --> 01:43:37,080
我也要你发誓 从此你留在家里
I also want you to swear that from now on,you'll stay home where you belong.

879
01:43:37,930 --> 01:43:39,450
你肯发誓吗?
Do you swear?

880
01:43:40,730 --> 01:43:42,320
肯吗?
Yes?

881
01:43:45,500 --> 01:43:46,900
好
Good.

882
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:49,930
瓦希里还活着 不会教我们失望
"We know he's alive. We know he won't fail us.

883
01:43:50,070 --> 01:43:51,560
因为他现就在我们当中
We know because he is a part of us now.

884
01:43:51,710 --> 01:43:53,870
瓦希里打不死
Vassili is eternal."

885
01:43:56,340 --> 01:43:57,830
你去了哪里?
Where have you been?

886
01:43:57,980 --> 01:43:59,710
我们到处找你
We've looked everywhere for you.

887
01:43:59,850 --> 01:44:01,580
你没听到?
Oh,didn't you hear?

888
01:44:02,150 --> 01:44:03,550
我死了
I was dead.

889
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:08,350
起码崇高的神射手瓦希里…
At least the noble sniper Zaitsev...

890
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:12,460
已经死去
Vassili was dead.

891
01:44:12,590 --> 01:44:14,390
现实中的
The real one.

892
01:44:16,830 --> 01:44:18,160
我…
Me...

893
01:44:19,870 --> 01:44:21,600
我睡着了…
I was asleep,

894
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:23,970
错失了机会
and I missed my chance.

895
01:44:24,110 --> 01:44:29,200
瑟缩在一角 躲避一个…
Then,I was curled up in a corner,hiding...

896
01:44:29,340 --> 01:44:31,780
想置我于死地的人
from a man who wants to kill me.

897
01:44:32,310 --> 01:44:34,140
我会向赫鲁晓夫报告
I'll talk to Kruschev.

898
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:36,710
他会把你调回原本的部队
He'll send you back to your old division.

899
01:44:37,690 --> 01:44:39,050
丹尼娅呢?
一 Where's Tania?

900
01:44:39,190 --> 01:44:40,950
她在防空洞
一 She's at the shelter.

901
01:44:41,220 --> 01:44:42,880
我到过防空洞
I've been to the shelter.

902
01:44:43,020 --> 01:44:45,360
我对她说你没死
I told her you weren't dead.

903
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:48,990
少校是这样说
The major said so.

904
01:44:49,130 --> 01:44:51,430
他说其他德军在骗人
He said the other Germans were lying.

905
01:44:51,570 --> 01:44:54,660
他说你会在车站等他
He told me you were waiting for him at the station.

906
01:44:57,940 --> 01:44:59,430
瓦希里…
Vassili.

907
01:45:20,290 --> 01:45:22,090
瓦希里…
Vassili.

908
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,730
瓦希里…
Vassili.

909
01:45:32,810 --> 01:45:38,040
我的小沙夏…不出我所料
My little Sacha. I knew it.

910
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:58,390
瓦希里 丹尼娅
一 Vassili. 一 Tania.

911
01:46:04,470 --> 01:46:06,410
我早知你没有死
I knew you weren't dead.

912
01:46:06,670 --> 01:46:09,310
你怎知道?
How?

913
01:46:09,810 --> 01:46:11,680
因为我们才刚遇上
Because we only just met.

914
01:46:15,750 --> 01:46:20,480
我长大之后首次祈祷
I prayed for the first time since I was a little girl.

915
01:46:20,920 --> 01:46:23,020
我一睁开眼睛…
When I opened my eyes,

916
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:26,920
沙夏就站在我面前 报告好消息
Sacha was standing there...waiting to give me the good news.

917
01:46:29,860 --> 01:46:32,630
他比我更爱你呢
I think he loves you even more than I do.

918
01:46:56,920 --> 01:46:59,260
致司令
To the proper military authority,

919
01:46:59,390 --> 01:47:01,950
兹呈报士兵瓦希里…
I'm calling to the commandant's attention the recent changes noticed...

920
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:06,900
近来作战态度改变了
in the attitude towards fighting of soldier Vassili Zaitsev.

921
01:47:07,030 --> 01:47:10,530
数度试图逃避职责
He has attempted on several occasions to escape his duties,

922
01:47:10,670 --> 01:47:13,110
公开发表悲观言论
voiced doubts on the chances of our victory...

923
01:47:13,240 --> 01:47:16,010
质疑我军胜利的可能
and made defeatist comments in public.

924
01:47:16,340 --> 01:47:19,240
他与纳粹枪手决斗 久未获胜
The inexplicable duration of his duel...

925
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:24,210
唯一的原因是…
with the Nazi sharpshooter can only be explained by...

926
01:47:24,350 --> 01:47:28,020
他对共产理念缺乏信心
his lack of belief in the communist ideal.

927
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:36,930
早晨 沙夏
Good morning,Sacha.

928
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:42,530
他再一次知道我的行踪
Once again,he knew exactly where to find me.

929
01:47:42,940 --> 01:47:45,170
你说奇不奇怪?
Don't you think that's strange?

930
01:47:46,340 --> 01:47:49,240
我的行踪 只有你知我知
Apart from me,only you knew.

931
01:47:50,710 --> 01:47:53,150
我不怪你
I don't hold it against you, Sacha.

932
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:55,610
你很勇敢
You've done a very brave thing.

933
01:47:56,650 --> 01:47:59,520
你爱自己国家，我很敬佩
You've chosen your camp. I respect that.

934
01:47:59,650 --> 01:48:01,620
但那不是我的阵营
But it isn't my camp.

935
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:03,750
你我都是军人
We're both soldiers,

936
01:48:04,490 --> 01:48:09,120
你我是敌人 我知道你会谅解的
and we're both enemies, so I know you understand.

937
01:48:09,430 --> 01:48:13,960
我生你气 因为你不留在家里
I'm annoyed with you,little Sacha,for not staying home as I made you swear to.

938
01:48:15,100 --> 01:48:19,400
我生你气 因为你逼我做一件事
I'm annoyed with you for obliging me to do what I'm going to have to do.

939
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:28,340
你连睡梦中也皱眉头
I've never seen anyone frown so much in their sleep.

940
01:48:31,020 --> 01:48:33,580
你看了我多久?
How long have you been watching me?

941
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:35,690
整晚
All night.

942
01:48:36,260 --> 01:48:39,190
你不断扯鼻鼾
You've been snoring away happily for hours.

943
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:42,050
我扯鼻鼾?
I don't snore. Do I?

944
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:43,690
像猪一样
Like a pig.

945
01:48:43,860 --> 01:48:46,200
我大概也有发开口梦吧?
I suppose I talk in my sleep as well.

946
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:48,330
是的
Yes.

947
01:48:50,740 --> 01:48:53,000
有件事我想告诉你
There's something I should tell you.

948
01:49:00,450 --> 01:49:05,410
我坐火车来这里的时候…
On the train... coming here...

949
01:49:07,420 --> 01:49:11,060
和你在同一个车厢 不可能
we were in the same car. No.

950
01:49:11,060 --> 01:49:12,790
我见到你
I saw you.

951
01:49:13,590 --> 01:49:17,290
你在看书 然后睡着了
You were reading, and you fell asleep.

952
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:23,400
我不敢看你 你太漂亮了
I didn't dare look at you, you were so beautiful.

953
01:49:24,970 --> 01:49:26,960
很惊人
It was scary.

954
01:49:29,540 --> 01:49:33,240
之后 我不断想起你
Afterwards,I couldn't stop thinking about you.

955
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:36,040
想起你就笑
It made me smile.

956
01:49:37,180 --> 01:49:42,140
又想到那些可以拥抱你
And then I thought of all the men who would get to hold you...

957
01:49:43,990 --> 01:49:45,980
逗你发笑的人
who'd make you laugh...

958
01:49:48,630 --> 01:49:50,820
他们多幸运
how lucky they were.

959
01:49:54,070 --> 01:49:57,330
现在我居然可以躺在你身边
And now I'm the one lying next to you.

960
01:49:59,770 --> 01:50:02,800
我有没有扯鼻鼾?  像猪一样
一 Was I snoring? 一 Like a pig.

961
01:50:33,890 --> 01:50:37,330
什么事?
What?

962
01:50:40,850 --> 01:50:42,210
我的天！
Oh,my God!

963
01:50:42,350 --> 01:50:43,910
不要出去！
Oh,no.

964
01:50:44,050 --> 01:50:46,110
天啊 丹尼娅 不能去！
一 Oh,my God! 一 Tania,no.

965
01:50:46,250 --> 01:50:47,950
丹尼娅 不能去！放开我！
一 Tania,no! 一 No,get off me!

966
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:50,550
放开我！  这正是他的诡计！
一 Get off me! Get off me! 一 It's what he wants!

967
01:50:50,550 --> 01:50:52,550
放开我！  这正是他的诡计！
一 Get off me! Get off me! 一 It's what he wants!

968
01:50:52,551 --> 01:50:54,830
他会杀死你 放手！等我来!
一 No,he'll kill you. He'll kill you! 一 Let me go!

969
01:50:54,830 --> 01:50:58,770
我跟你出去 他也会杀死我  等我来!
一 I'll run after you,and he'll kill me. 一 Let me go!

970
01:50:58,900 --> 01:51:00,730
放开我！  这正是他的目的 我会干掉他的
一 Let me go! 一 This is what he wants! I'll get him.

971
01:51:00,870 --> 01:51:04,720
我保证会杀死他
I promise I'll get him.

972
01:51:04,910 --> 01:51:08,430
我保证会拿他的枪给你
I'll get his rifle for you. I promise,Tania.

973
01:51:27,070 --> 01:51:30,490
我需要你帮忙
I need you.

974
01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:36,930
费太太 你必须走 斯大林格勒可能沦陷
You have to leave now,Mrs.Filipov. Stalingrad may fall.

975
01:51:37,140 --> 01:51:39,630
最后的船快开了 德军随时攻到
The last of the boats are leaving. The Germans will be here any moment.

976
01:51:39,770 --> 01:51:41,170
我们替你弄到通行证
He's brought you a pass.

977
01:51:41,310 --> 01:51:42,870
你在对岸会很安全
You'll be safe on the other side.

978
01:51:43,010 --> 01:51:45,880
收拾行李 我们送你去码头
Gather your things,and we'll help you carry them to the landing stage.

979
01:51:46,010 --> 01:51:49,470
我不走 这是我的家
I'm not leaving. This is my home.

980
01:51:49,620 --> 01:51:52,610
这是沙夏的家 不可以走
This is my Sacha's home. I can't leave.

981
01:51:52,750 --> 01:51:55,280
费太太 我有件事要告诉你
I have to tell you something, Mrs.Filipov.

982
01:51:57,630 --> 01:52:00,030
这件事难以明白
Something very difficult to understand.

983
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:03,090
关于沙夏的
It's about Sacha.

984
01:52:17,210 --> 01:52:18,840
沙夏投靠了德军
He's gone over to the Germans.

985
01:52:18,980 --> 01:52:22,205
出卖了国家 他现在跟德军一起
He's betrayed his country.He's with the enemy now.

986
01:52:22,206 --> 01:52:23,280
不会回来了
He won't be coming back.

987
01:52:25,290 --> 01:52:26,880
我的天！
Oh,my God.

988
01:52:30,790 --> 01:52:32,690
我的天！
Oh,my God.

989
01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:37,560
他做了叛徒
He's become a traitor.

990
01:52:38,530 --> 01:52:44,230
可怜的小鬼头 他做了什么?
The poor little thing. What has he done?

991
01:52:47,010 --> 01:52:49,600
那么 他会留在那边?
So,he's going to stay over there?

992
01:52:54,150 --> 01:52:55,640
是的
Yes...

993
01:52:56,150 --> 01:52:58,280
他会留在那边
he's going to stay over there.

994
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:02,820
政委同志 我不应该这样说
I shouldn't be saying this,comrade Commissar,

995
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:05,050
不过 这样或者更好
but maybe it's for the best.

996
01:53:05,860 --> 01:53:08,450
假如德军打胜 他会安全
If the Germans have won, he'll be safe.

997
01:53:08,630 --> 01:53:12,530
或者对他来说 这是正确选择
I know it's wrong,but perhaps he has made the right choice.

998
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:34,410
丹尼娅！  丹尼娅！
一  Oh! Oh,Tania! 一  Tania?

999
01:53:35,560 --> 01:53:38,750
丹尼娅！  丹尼娅！
一 Oh,Tania! 一 Tania!

1000
01:53:39,250 --> 01:53:42,210
天啊
Oh,my God! Oh!

1001
01:53:58,780 --> 01:54:00,440
有没有医生?
I need a doctor!

1002
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:03,320
医生！
A doctor!

1003
01:54:07,420 --> 01:54:08,980
我有通行证
I have a pass. I have a pass!

1004
01:54:09,120 --> 01:54:12,560
你一定要让她上船！
You must let her cross.

1005
01:54:14,450 --> 01:54:17,050
求求你
Please!

1006
01:54:17,200 --> 01:54:18,990
没用的 她不会活得成
It's useless. She'll never make it.

1007
01:54:19,130 --> 01:54:20,760
她会！
No! No,she will!

1008
01:54:21,100 --> 01:54:23,760
她是我女儿
She's my daughter! She's my daughter!

1009
01:54:23,900 --> 01:54:26,240
求求你！  好吧
一 I beg of you! 一 All right.

1010
01:54:26,470 --> 01:54:30,470
你们两个 抬她上船
一 Oh,thank you! 一 Put this one on the boat.

1011
01:54:54,740 --> 01:55:01,400
我身体很好 会撤退到对岸
沙夏 保重

1012
01:55:15,930 --> 01:55:19,390
他在哪里?
Where is he?

1013
01:55:19,890 --> 01:55:21,420
少校在哪里?
Where's the major?

1014
01:55:21,560 --> 01:55:23,810
咫尺之间
A few inches from your face.

1015
01:55:23,810 --> 01:55:29,440
我一直都很愚昧 瓦希里
I've been such a fool, Vassili.

1016
01:55:29,660 --> 01:55:33,770
人性改不了
Man will always be man.

1017
01:55:33,770 --> 01:55:35,940
没什么特殊的
There is no new man.

1018
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:40,510
我们努力去创造平等社会
We tried so hard to create a society that was equal,

1019
01:55:40,650 --> 01:55:43,630
希望大家不用妒忌别人
where there'd be nothing to envy your neighbor.

1020
01:55:43,630 --> 01:55:48,090
可是 人总有令别人妒忌的东西
But there's always something to envy.

1021
01:55:48,660 --> 01:55:50,620
一个微笑
A smile...

1022
01:55:51,130 --> 01:55:52,920
一份友谊
a friendship.

1023
01:55:54,090 --> 01:55:57,960
求之而不可得的东西
Something you don't have and want to appropriate.

1024
01:55:58,300 --> 01:56:02,700
在这世上 即使是苏联的世界…
In this world even a Soviet one

1025
01:56:02,840 --> 01:56:05,400
总是有贫富差别
there will always be rich and poor.

1026
01:56:06,970 --> 01:56:09,240
富于天赋
Rich in gifts...

1027
01:56:10,440 --> 01:56:12,540
贫于天赋
poor in gifts.

1028
01:56:13,450 --> 01:56:15,350
富于爱情
Rich in love...

1029
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:18,880
贫于爱情
poor in love.

1030
01:56:24,860 --> 01:56:27,450
丹尼娅不会回来了
Tania isn't coming back.

1031
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:31,690
她死了 瓦希里
She's dead,Vassili.

1032
01:56:39,810 --> 01:56:42,210
给炮弹碎片击中
She was cut down by shrapnel. 

1033
01:56:42,340 --> 01:56:47,250
事出突然 她该没看到碎片飞来
It was quick.I don't think she even saw it coming.

1034
01:56:47,780 --> 01:56:49,720
她本来回来找你
She was on her way back to you.

1035
01:56:49,850 --> 01:56:53,250
把费太太送上船之后
As soon as she had seen Mrs.Filipov to the boats,

1036
01:56:53,390 --> 01:56:55,580
马上回来找你
she was coming back for you.

1037
01:56:55,790 --> 01:57:00,590
她是对的 瓦希里 你是个好人
She was right. You're a good man,Vassili.

1038
01:57:04,030 --> 01:57:06,660
我想帮你一个忙
I want to help you, Vassili.

1039
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:09,200
我想做最后一件事
Let me do one last thing.

1040
01:57:09,340 --> 01:57:12,740
做一件善事 补偿一下
Something useful for a change.

1041
01:57:17,780 --> 01:57:19,340
我帮你把少校引出来
Let me show you where the major is.

1042
01:57:19,510 --> 01:57:20,950
不要这样做
Don't do that.

1043
01:57:21,150 --> 01:57:22,380
千万不要！
Don't do that!

1044
02:01:22,060 --> 02:01:23,220
两个月后

1045
02:01:23,360 --> 02:01:27,050
1943年2月3日

1046
02:01:36,600 --> 02:01:40,100
今天1943年2月3日…
Today,February3,1943, is an ominous day for Hitler...

1047
02:01:40,240 --> 02:01:46,250
对希特勒和无数的德国战俘而言是不祥的一天
and the endless columns of hundreds of thousands of German prisoners.

1048
02:01:46,250 --> 02:01:54,350
但却是俄罗斯胜利难忘的一天
It is an unforgettable day of hope for our motherland.

1049
02:02:02,660 --> 02:02:06,890
经过了斯大林格勒180天
After 180 days of heroic combat...

1050
02:02:07,030 --> 02:02:09,370
奋勇的战斗
in the market city of Stalingrad,

1051
02:02:09,540 --> 02:02:14,470
以及我军奋不顾身的作战
and as a result of the valor and self-sacrifice of our soldiers,

1052
02:02:14,640 --> 02:02:17,770
我们伟大的红军领袖…
the commander of our glorious Red Army...

1053
02:02:17,910 --> 02:02:26,940
接受了法西斯侵略者无条件投降
received the unconditional surrender... of the German fascist invaders.

1054
02:02:37,430 --> 02:02:38,660
抱歉 没有 小伙子
Sorry. No,young man, 

1055
02:02:39,430 --> 02:02:43,460
我在册子里找不到那个名字 请再找找
一 I cannot find...a matching name in the book. 一 Could you check again?

1056
02:02:43,600 --> 02:02:46,000
这是这医院地址 这是她的名字
一 This is the address and her name. 一 She is not here.

1057
02:02:46,140 --> 02:02:50,800
地址没错 但她不在这里
Yes,this is our address, but we don't have her anymore.

1058
02:02:51,010 --> 02:02:52,740
这是你们的地址 很对不起
一 This is the address. She's been here. 一 I'm so sorry.

1059
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:54,400
她写过信给我
She wrote to me.

1060
02:02:54,550 --> 02:02:56,540
我查过三次了 她不在这里
I looked three times. She's not here.

1061
02:02:56,680 --> 02:03:01,120
我们的确没有丹尼娅这个人 我们爱莫能助 
Believe me,there is no Tania Chernova. I can't help you.

1062
02:03:01,250 --> 02:03:04,380
对不起
I'm so sorry.

1063
02:03:57,710 --> 02:04:00,540
瓦希里数度获颁列宁勋章

1064
02:04:00,680 --> 02:04:03,580
更被列入苏联英雄的行列

1065
02:04:03,720 --> 02:04:06,150
他所用的步枪…

1066
02:04:06,350 --> 02:04:08,450
连同其他战胜纳粹党的标志

1067
02:04:08,590 --> 02:04:10,920
至今仍然陈列在…

1068
02:04:11,060 --> 02:04:13,060
斯大林格勒历史博物馆里
