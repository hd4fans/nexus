1
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,240
I am a stone.

2
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,510
I do not move.

3
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:53,650
Very slowly, I put snow in my mouth,

4
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,890
then he won't see my breath.

5
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,670
I take my time. I let him come closer.

6
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,570
I have only one bullet.

7
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,480
I aim at his eye.

8
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:18,950
Very gently,my finger presses on the trigger.

9
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,020
I do not tremble.

10
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,960
I have no fear.

11
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:32,160
I'm a big boy now.

12
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,540
Ready,Vassili?

13
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,830
Now,Vassili. Fire!

14
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:44,950
Fire,Vassili! Fire!

15
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,970
Come on,pick your feet up.

16
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,430
Get on your feet. Prepare to board the train.

17
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,940
You there,come along with me now. This way,pal.

18
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,620
All civilians,get out!

19
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,390
Make way,let the civilians off.

20
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,100
This is a military convoy.

21
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:17,430
No one stays on board but our valiant soldiers.

22
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,540
This is a convoy

23
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:24,580
to Stalingrad...

24
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:35,110
only for the soldiers of the Red Army.

25
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:39,620
This is a military convoy.

26
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,110
to Stalingrad...

27
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,150
All aboard!

28
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,190
Autumn,1942.

29
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,820
Europe lies crushed beneath the Nazi jackboot.

30
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,440
The German Third Reich I sat the height of its power.

31
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,870
Hitler's armies are charging through the heart of the Soviet Union...

32
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,070
towards the oilfields of Asia.

33
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,770
One last obstacle remains.

34
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:37,310
A city on the Volga... where the fate of the world is being decided.

35
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,780
Stalingrad.

36
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:07,130
The Red Army and all citizens of the Soviet Union

37
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:12,530
must defend every inch of Soviet soil.Must fight to the last.

38
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:35,210
Glorious comrade Stalin... has ordered not another step backwards.

39
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,870
The people of the Soviet Union shall be free.

40
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,440
Never gonna be a slaves£¡

41
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:58,290
Go forward,comrades.

42
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,530
Not a step backwards!

43
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,920
Listen to these letters sent by Russian mothers...

44
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,990
to their sons on the front.

45
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:25,020
"Volodya,my child,

46
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,180
I know that it's for our motherland

47
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:35,960
"I know that it's for our motherland that you are giving your life.

48
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:56,610
"Everyone here knows that you will not fall back.

49
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,320
"Everyone here is proud of you.

50
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,730
"Your father is dead. Your brothers are dead.

51
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,270
Avenge us on the hordes of fascists. "

52
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,260
Everybody drops here!

53
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,310
Find coverd£¡

54
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,100
Nobody move! Stay on the boat!

55
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,510
Get back or I'll shoot!

56
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:54,880
Back from the rails,or we shoot. Shoot the traitors!

57
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,570
Ready ashore!

58
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,590
Come on,come on! Move!

59
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,940
Come on,comrades,

60
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,360
Come on,comrades, come on!

61
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,360
Move,or you'll be shot!

62
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,640
Over here,stretcher!

63
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,150
The one with the rifle shoots!

64
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:11,090
One out of two gets a rifle.

65
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,090
The one without follows him!

66
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:17,730
When the one with the rifle gets killed,

67
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:23,288
the one who is following picks up the rifle and shoots!

68
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:28,140
The one with the rifle shoots!

69
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,580
The one without follows him!

70
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:35,110
When the one with the rifle gets killed,

71
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:41,280
the one who is following... picks up the rifle and shoots!

72
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:48,660
The one with the rifle shoots! This way,now.The one without follows him!

73
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,050
Soldiers of the glorious Red Army,

74
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:19,830
from now on...it is either victory or death!

75
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:23,590
- Those who retreat will be shot. - I need a rifle.

76
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:30,970
There will be no mercy For cowards and traitors! Achtung!

77
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,220
Aah!

78
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:21,340
It's hopeless,comrades. Get back!

79
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,750
Pullback!

80
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:29,360
Pullback! Get back! Get back!

81
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,920
In the name of the Soviet Union,

82
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:36,200
not a step backwards, or we shoot.

83
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,430
No retreat! Not a step back!

84
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,560
- No mercy! - Deserters will be shot. Cowards will be shot!

85
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,290
- Fire! - Shoot the traitors!

86
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,280
Cowards will be shot!

87
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,670
No mercy for cowards!

88
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,080
Russians,surrender.

89
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,080
You will see your home again.

90
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,880
This is not your war.

91
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:41,690
Join your German comrades, They understand your suffering...

92
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:45,530
and will care more for you than your own officers,

93
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,790
who are only sending you to your death.

94
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,870
The Third Reich Is not your enemy.

95
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,570
The enemy is blood thirsty Stalin And his Bolshevik camp,

96
00:14:54,710 --> 00:15:01,310
who have stolen your land,who have deported your father

97
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,040
Fire!

98
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:27,190
You'll get us caught, comrade Commissar.

99
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,080
With your permission, comrade Commissar.

100
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,750
Which one should I aim at first?

101
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:30,080
You should wait...till there's an explosion.

102
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,240
Do you know how to shoot?

103
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,130
A little.

104
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,520
Damn!Damn!

105
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,290
Don't shoot. Don't shoot. He's looking at us.

106
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,520
Thank you, comrade Commissar.

107
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:59,800
Danilov,political officer, second class.

108
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,130
Twenty- first infantry.

109
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,850
"Vassili Zaitsev."

110
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,630
"On this day, September the 20th,1942,

111
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:30,670
"a shepherd boy from the Urals...

112
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:37,970
"arrived in the city of Stalingrad, on the banks of the Volga.

113
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:41,250
"His name is Vassili Zaitsev.

114
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:47,000
"Like thousands before him,he came to answer comrade Stalin's call.

115
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,420
"Armed with a rifle,

116
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,620
he quickly made the fascist invader realize that...

117
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:57,590
"from now on he would be punished for every step he took in the motherland;

118
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,230
that from here on, the only way was back."

119
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,830
What do you think?

120
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,900
I think comrade Commissar's been overgenerous.

121
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:33,150
Let me go! Let me go!

122
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,530
Don't cross the line!

123
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:41,900
By order of comrade Stalin, no civilian can leave the city.

124
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,200
Get back!

125
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,680
Let me go!

126
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:50,150
Stand away, or we will open fire.

127
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:02,370
Stand away!

128
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,690
Get back!

129
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,060
Get back or we shoot!

130
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,290
Back! Keep back!

131
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,370
Make way for comrade Stalin 's envoy!

132
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,340
I carried out my orders.

133
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:23,310
I sent in all of my boys.

134
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,210
But the Germans engulfed us.

135
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:31,590
They have artillery, aircraft,tanks.

136
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,210
And me,what did I have?

137
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,350
The sacred duty to resist!

138
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,890
I have to report to the boss.

139
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:44,160
Perhaps you'd prefer to avoid the red tape.

140
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,530
My name is...

141
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:14,390
Nikita Sergeyevich Kruschev.

142
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:18,200
I've come to take things in hand here.

143
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:22,000
This city is not Kursk...

144
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,580
nor is it Kiev,nor Minsk.

145
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,640
This city is Stalingrad.

146
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,310
Stalingrad!

147
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,610
This city bears the name of the boss.

148
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,850
It's more than a city, it's a symbol.

149
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:44,990
If the Germans capture this city,

150
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:48,500
the entire country will collapse.

151
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:56,330
Now,I want our boys... to raise their heads.

152
00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:00,200
I want them to act like they have balls!

153
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:05,050
I want them to stop shitting their pants!

154
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,290
That's your job.

155
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:17,190
As political officers, I'm counting on you.

156
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:23,820
You, what's your suggestion?

157
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:29,000
Shoot all the other generals who have retreated... and their chiefs of staff too.

158
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,810
M-Make some examples.

159
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,710
- D - D - Deport families of the deserters.- Yeah,that's all been done.

160
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:37,750
Give them hope!

161
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:53,630
Here,the men's only choice is between German bullets and ours.

162
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,890
But there's another way.

163
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:00,040
The way of courage.The way of love of the motherland.

164
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,770
We must publish the army newspaper again.

165
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:06,280
We must tell magnificent stories. Stories that extol... sacrifice,bravery.

166
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,610
We must make them believe in the victory.

167
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:13,380
We must give them hope, pride,a desire to fight.

168
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:17,120
Yes,we need to make examples.

169
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,590
But examples to follow.

170
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,550
What we need...

171
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,820
are heroes.

172
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,100
Do you know any heroes around here?

173
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,470
Yes,comrade, I know one.

174
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,580
That's me!

175
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:46,420
"Vassili Zaitsev." That's me!

176
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,420
No,you're not dreaming.

177
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,220
It's your name.

178
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,690
We made the front page.

179
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:55,380
They haven't changed a word.

180
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,390
Do you have any idea what this means?

181
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:02,100
It's not the back page, it's not the second page,

182
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,200
It's the front page.

183
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,630
The front page!

184
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:06,900
They're going to reprint our article everywhere.

185
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,770
In the Caucasus,in the Crimea,

186
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,500
even in the Urals.

187
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,740
Tomorrow morning,Stalin himself will be sitting over breakfast,

188
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:18,250
reading my words, memorizing your name.

189
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,650
We're famous,Vassili.

190
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,180
Kruschev loved the article.

191
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,580
He's promoted me to the general staff.

192
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,090
And you

193
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,780
to sniper division.

194
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:32,090
- Well,that's good. - It's very good.

195
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:34,960
- It's very good. It's great. - It's very great!- It's great!

196
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,170
- For us because we did it together. - Together!

197
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:40,070
- Although I did all the hard work. - Oh,yeah?

198
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:42,440
- You're very lucky I can't fight back. - Why's that?

199
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,140
Because Kruschev told me to make sure nothing happens to you.

200
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,570
- You're too important. - I'm too valuable.

201
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:52,040
Yes,careful of my-  careful of my glasses,please. They're new. Sorry,sir.

202
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,950
- I'm famous! We're famous! - I'm famous! I'm famous!

203
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:59,060
Vassili, the young shepherd from the Urals,

204
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,250
killed his 12th German officer today.

205
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:02,920
He used to hunt wolves, Now he shoots fascists.

206
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,260
Today,Vassili Zaitsev shot his 23rd German officer.

207
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,390
One more colonel shot by... He is an example to us all.

208
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,090
Today Vassili shot his 32nd German officer.

209
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,760
He has patience of a hunter.

210
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,930
He has patience of Russia people.

211
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,230
Count only the Germans you have killed.

212
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:20,270
- Today,Vassili Zaitsev-  - Here is the evidenceÒ»

213
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:22,900
11 dog tags retrieved by sniper Vassili Zaitsev.

214
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,090
More and more men and women,

215
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,210
fighters from all branches of our armed forces,

216
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,260
join the sniper division

217
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:36,590
and learn the skills of Vassili Zaitsev.

218
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,260
I am a stone.

219
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,730
I am a stone.

220
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:52,540
I breathe slowly.

221
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,440
I aim at the eye.

222
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,950
So it is you,

223
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:36,140
the great Vassili Zaitsev.

224
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,810
My mother makes potatoes with bacon.

225
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:40,910
Sounds good.

226
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,390
When she sees you, she won't believe her eyes.

227
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,960
How many today?

228
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:48,890
Only two.

229
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,270
And the last one, why didn't you shoot him?

230
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,130
He was only a foot soldier.

231
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:56,610
Wasn't worth giving away my position.

232
00:29:58,010 --> 00:29:59,440
- Bless you.

233
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,480
We know how much we owe you.

234
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,650
We pray for you every day.

235
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:11,410
Every evening,we listen to them talk about you on Radio Moscow.

236
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,290
Thanks.

237
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:15,860
You've certainly managed well down here.

238
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,950
My parents used to store furniture down here before the war.

239
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,830
Sacha,drop that right now.

240
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,400
It's loaded.

241
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,770
This way,comrade Commissar.

242
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,440
Thank you,comrade.

243
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:42,380
Good evening.

244
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,350
Comrade Zaitsev?

245
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:56,770
My God,where does all this mail come from?

246
00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:00,870
From all over the country, Mrs.Filipov,from all over.

247
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,600
This one's from the workers of the Kouzbass.

248
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,970
They want to name their mine after Vassili.

249
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,510
Right,let's start with the miners.

250
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,510
Come on, let's get to work.

251
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,550
Dear comrades from the Kouzbass,

252
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:23,180
- Kouzbass. - I thank you for your letter of praise.

253
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,530
- Praise?  - R - A - I - S - E.

254
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:35,070
And... I hope that I can live up...

255
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:43,580
to your expectations. - A - T - I - O - N - S. Expectations.

256
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,350
You're interested in German literature,Mrs.Filipov?

257
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,890
It's all right, it's our neighbor.

258
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,320
- Right,where were we?

259
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:55,450
- Tania,we have guests.

260
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,500
Your offer to name-

261
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,870
I-

262
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:10,370
I - I recognize you.

263
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,970
He's Vassili Zaitsev.

264
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:20,950
I saw your picture in the paper.

265
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:23,620
Thank you For everything you're doing.

266
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,190
And this is his friend,Commissar.....

267
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,450
Danilo

268
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,330
Danilov.

269
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,690
Tania is like a daughter to me.

270
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:34,630
She used to take care of Sacha when I worked at the factory.

271
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,530
She even taught him German.

272
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,730
- All these books are hers. - Oh,they're yours?

273
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,100
She studied German at the university.

274
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,400
- Which university? - Moscow.

275
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,280
Moscow. Moscow.

276
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:55,250
Shouldn't we,uh-

277
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,780
Yes,let's continue.

278
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:04,870
Your offer to name Your mine after me...

279
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:08,580
is... a great honor.

280
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:15,670
H - O - N. Yes,I know. Honor.

281
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,400
Very good.

282
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,310
Shouldn't we

283
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,710
Shouldn't we try make the point that I'm not the only one fighting?

284
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,750
That - That's excellent - excellent idea,Vassili.

285
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:29,880
- We can take it even further though. - Oh.

286
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,920
We can take it further.

287
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:36,550
Your battle for The production of coal...

288
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,320
is as worthy as mine.

289
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:45,040
There's no "K" in coal.

290
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:49,340
Just - just one "L."

291
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:52,240
Oh,tell me if I'm going too fast.

292
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,584
- No,you're not going too fast. - You sure?

293
00:33:55,585 --> 00:33:57,720
I just thought is there Any other improvements?

294
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,510
Why don't you get some rest?

295
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:01,920
These letters can wait until tomorrow.

296
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:03,540
We should carry on.

297
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,950
We're not tired.Thank you,Mrs.Filipov.

298
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:10,800
These people... took the trouble to write to us.

299
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,530
Tomorrow,we may not be around to write back.

300
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,700
Major Konig, Herr General.

301
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:54,330
I was expecting someone... else.

302
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:56,670
Certainly not someone so prestigious.

303
00:35:56,870 --> 00:36:03,300
I imagine you have your reasons... for getting yourself involved in this hellish situation.

304
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:09,810
My army is not designed For this kind of fighting.

305
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:13,440
Yesterday,yet again, I had to promote...25 sergeants

306
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:16,780
to replace the officers shot down by their sharpshooters.

307
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:22,560
Those snipers are demoralizing my people.

308
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:29,490
This city is no more than... a heap of ruins.

309
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,730
But the fuehrer's persisting.

310
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:38,400
He has made it a personal matter between Stalin and himself.

311
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:47,090
We should trust the fuehrer's instinct.

312
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:50,820
He always managed to lead us to victory.

313
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:55,390
We shall be back home For Christmas.

314
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:03,600
How are you going to go about finding this young Russian?

315
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:08,040
I'll fix it so that he's the one who finds me.

316
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:13,370
Vassili. Vassili.

317
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:16,210
- Come on,time to get up. - What?

318
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:20,480
They have a problem in the department store sector. They need us. Come on.

319
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:33,860
Look,Vassili,he's hiding in the department store. Over there.

320
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,190
So far this morning,

321
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:45,520
he's knocked off five officers, plus two machine gunners.

322
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:49,740
Look,third floor,

323
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,510
fourth window from the left.

324
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,080
Fourth window from the left.

325
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,920
See him?

326
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,650
Yeah,I see him.

327
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:16,810
There,you got him!

328
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,980
Great shot.

329
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,210
Let's go get his dog tag.

330
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,210
Good bye,comrade Commissar.

331
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:35,240
Thank you for your hospitality,Mrs.Filipov.

332
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,230
You can borrow whatever you like.

333
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:49,470
I'm not sure what they would say to me at headquarters...

334
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:51,670
if I came back with an armful of Goethe and Schiller.

335
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,510
There's some Marx too.

336
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:57,750
You were assigned to civil defense at the 12th district?

337
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,340
No,I volunteered.

338
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:04,080
It's such a coincidence meeting you like this.

339
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,180
Comrade Kruschev was telling me just yesterday...

340
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:07,820
how desperately we're in need of operators who speak German.

341
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,220
I can't.

342
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,130
Our militia's responsible for all the people in this neighbourhood.

343
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,700
We're already desperately short of men.

344
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:16,890
We'll give you a dozen soldiers for every one that speaks German.

345
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,730
I'd rather stay and fight.

346
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:22,140
Serving at headquarters is fighting. You'd be far more useful there.

347
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,270
You stay here. You cover us.

348
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,440
All right.

349
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,050
We go.

350
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,450
Take care.

351
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,720
Ludmilla,come on.

352
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,430
Check the stairway.

353
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:26,850
It's a trap. I know.

354
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:53,160
Move back.

355
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:43,460
He's still here.

356
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,520
They're coming straight for us!

357
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:14,660
Ludmilla,stay where you are, he's over there somewhere.

358
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:28,110
We have to get out of here!

359
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,810
We have to get out of here!

360
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:34,210
Just stay where you are!

361
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,480
What are we gonna do? Ludmilla,stay where you are!

362
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,200
Fuck this,I'm going.

363
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:58,910
Ludmilla,no!

364
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,160
What does this mean?

365
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:58,960
"The little shepherd from the Urals receives a new sniper's rifle,

366
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:03,800
"a Mosin - Nagant 7.62, with its 3.5 - power P.U. telescope.

367
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:07,690
Pride of precision Of Soviet production."

368
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:10,250
- I've seen that rifle close up. - Have you?

369
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:11,970
I've even touched it.

370
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,850
I know him well,Vassili Zaitsev.

371
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,460
Ludmilla and Anton were killed today,

372
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,740
and it was my fault.

373
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:11,810
No,I'm sure that's not true.

374
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:14,040
There was a German sniper.

375
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:16,910
I walked them right into his trap.

376
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:19,240
What else can you tell me?

377
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:20,780
He didn't relocate.

378
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,850
A sniper who doesn't relocate

379
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:26,320
isn't normal.

380
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,090
He was very good.

381
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:32,960
It wasn't just his shooting,it was his instinct.

382
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:36,000
He was a step ahead of me all the time.

383
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:40,030
That's because he knows everything about you.

384
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:43,870
His name is Konig, Major Konig.

385
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:45,600
They've sent him here

386
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:51,610
to ki...to find you.

387
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:00,150
At first we weren't sure if the information was reliable.

388
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:03,160
It seems he's come all the way from Berlin to stop you.

389
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:06,300
You've caused them so many sleepless nights,they sent their top marksman.

390
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:07,900
What do we know about him?

391
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:10,630
He's a major in the Wehrmacht.

392
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:15,030
He's director of their sniper school in Zossen.

393
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:18,510
Koulikov studied under him at Zossen before the war.

394
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,770
He knows all his tricks.

395
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:22,400
From now on, he'll go with you everywhere.

396
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:27,080
A nobleman from Bavaria who hunts deer...

397
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:30,090
against a shepherd boy from the Urals who poaches wolves.

398
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:33,890
It's more than a confrontation between two nations.

399
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:39,720
It's the essence Of class struggle.

400
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,120
I'm glad you're so happy.

401
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,060
He had all the advantages.

402
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,190
Next time you'll be even.

403
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:49,830
No one shoots like you,Vassili.

404
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,140
She's been transferred.

405
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:05,520
I'll see if they're ready for you next door.

406
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:11,250
Hello.

407
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,660
You look smart in your new uniform.

408
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:17,390
Make sure they don't take it back once you've finished.

409
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:20,640
Yeah,they probably will.

410
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:27,710
I've heard the rumor about the German,

411
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:29,470
and I wanted to wish you luck.

412
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:31,910
Thank you. I'll need it.

413
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:34,380
From what comrade Danilov tells me,

414
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:36,310
you're going to win.

415
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,300
Hmm.

416
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,290
It's time.

417
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:49,140
-  Vassili! Vassili! - Come to my arms.

418
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:52,630
Look in my direction.

419
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,540
Put your cap back on, you look more heroic.

420
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:57,870
This way,comrade Zaitsev.

421
00:49:58,010 --> 00:49:59,140
I love this little fellow.

422
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,440
Vassili,is it true that you volunteered for the front?

423
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:03,810
How old are you,Vassili?

424
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:05,750
Do you know what this duel means for our country?

425
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,150
Is it true you killed your first wolf when you were five?

426
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:10,190
Vassili,tell me how many officers had been kill today?

427
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,120
Are you proud to be challenged By the best sharpshooter in Germany?

428
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:15,020
The Germans are starting to shit their pants.

429
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:18,090
Go on,my boy,tell us how you're going to deal with him.

430
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:20,200
- Or rather,no.- One more question,please.

431
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:21,920
Tell it to the boss.

432
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:24,800
He likes good hunting stories.

433
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,140
Look at him with pride,

434
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:35,680
because he's looking at you.

435
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:40,020
The whole country is looking at you.

436
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:06,480
Forgive me,forgive me, Grandfather.

437
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:41,110
So,it's not the wolf that chooses the hunting ground...

438
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:43,380
but the hunter.

439
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:50,180
But I'm sure your grandfather taught you that.

440
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:59,060
Except in this case, I'm the game.

441
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:08,210
However, today what we're going to do... is lure the wolf out of his lair...

442
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:10,200
to where we want him to be.

443
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:53,740
You're the one whose life is valuable. You go first.

444
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,680
No,no. We take it in turns.

445
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:57,810
Next time is your turn to go first,

446
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,350
and then it's you,Volodya.

447
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:18,010
Son of a bitch!

448
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:19,940
Get off!

449
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:23,470
These are new pants.

450
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:27,640
I just took them Off a captain from the 25 1st yesterday.

451
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,520
Sixteen months I spent in Germany

452
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:36,220
at the school in Zossen.

453
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:39,630
Of course,those were the days when we were friends with the Krauts,:

454
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:44,300
when our Joseph and their Adolph...

455
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,670
were walking hand in hand.

456
00:53:48,610 --> 00:53:51,340
From here to the wire, 160meters,right?

457
00:53:57,050 --> 00:53:58,810
155

458
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:00,110
Whatever.

459
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,050
That'll make 'em Send out a repair guy.

460
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:05,520
Let's relocate.

461
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:15,560
Aah!

462
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:28,510
Hey,Volodya!

463
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,320
After the Germans invaded us,

464
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:44,160
it wasn't the same atmosphere anymore.

465
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:48,060
Threw my ass in prison.

466
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:50,760
What were you doing in Germany,huh?

467
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:55,500
Excuse me,says I,but it was comrade Stalin who sent me there.

468
00:54:55,870 --> 00:55:00,280
Don't bring our glorious leader into your treachery.

469
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:03,810
Confess,spy bastard! Confess.

470
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:04,940
And bang! Bang,bang,bang!

471
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,360
Well,there wasn't a sickle, but there was a hammer.

472
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:16,720
And bang.

473
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:19,290
Knocked out all my teeth.

474
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:24,940
That's right,boy. Have no illusions.

475
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:29,370
That's the land of socialism and universal bliss for you.

476
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,780
Hey! It's your repair guy.

477
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:39,250
I got him.

478
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:55,080
It's about soup time, isn't it?

479
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,870
I'm going.

480
00:55:57,870 --> 00:56:00,360
Well,get a move on,Volodya,

481
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:05,270
and try not to spill it all on your way back,you Marxist bastard.

482
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:22,990
The enemy sniper activity reported during the past 24 hours,Herr Major.

483
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:28,760
Two sentries shot in the train station sector.

484
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,490
One artillery observer in the Northern sector.

485
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:35,730
One lieutenant from the 24th Panzer division in the factory sector.

486
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:38,870
Three telephone repairmen in the workers' housing sector.

487
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:43,450
They also tell me we have just taken a prisoner who may interest you.

488
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:45,580
I hope he's still able to speak.

489
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,010
Excuse me,sir?

490
00:56:47,850 --> 00:56:50,340
Nothing. Thank you.

491
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:58,250
So,tell us,Volodya, which building is he in?

492
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:03,390
There is no way I know that.

493
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:06,900
He moves around all the time.

494
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:09,600
He jumps from one to the next.

495
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:11,300
On which floor?

496
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:13,710
I don't know.

497
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,740
We'll see about that.

498
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:18,880
Undress him.

499
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:21,680
Put him in one of our uniforms.

500
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:53,740
You see,they are stubborn.

501
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,640
That's the good thing about the Germans.

502
00:57:57,020 --> 00:58:01,290
Man,you got to admit when they get an idea in their heads

503
00:58:16,470 --> 00:58:18,030
Right.

504
00:58:18,610 --> 00:58:23,910
Let's see if our customer has arrived. Are you ready?

505
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,960
UhÒ»huh.

506
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:30,110
And now our famous shepherd from the Urals,

507
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:32,220
who Major Konig thinks is an idiot,

508
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:35,790
gets up to make sure he has hit his target.

509
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:38,430
Major Konig sees him.

510
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:44,430
Aims for his helmet.

511
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:46,470
Fires.

512
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,800
Reveals his position

513
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:51,430
And is shot in turn.

514
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,280
Except...

515
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:05,620
Major Konig doesn't fire...

516
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:12,620
because Major Konig isn't there.

517
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,990
Koulikov!

518
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:27,540
Don't you think that was strange, that last one?

519
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,880
They sent him out to get shot like the others.

520
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:32,900
It's not natural.

521
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:36,740
Not without artillery, without trying to cover him.

522
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:41,150
Oh,no,I'm the one who was stupid.

523
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:43,920
They don't give a shit about telephone guys.

524
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:46,390
I mean,it's like us with the Ukrainians.

525
00:59:46,530 --> 00:59:50,230
They'd never bother a major over a few dead grunts.

526
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:55,400
Tomorrow,we'll kill us some generals.

527
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:05,340
Whose turn is it?

528
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:08,080
Mine,I think.

529
01:00:09,390 --> 01:00:11,720
Oh,you're such a cheater!

530
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:15,440
You can't fool Papa Koulikov.

531
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:19,390
No,no,no,no,no,no,no, it's my turn to go first.

532
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,730
And it's your turn to get a hole in your britches.

533
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,080
To victory.

534
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:54,380
This sniper business has been dragging on too long.

535
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:57,850
What's that little fellow of yours up to?

536
01:01:59,930 --> 01:02:02,160
He's probing, comrade Kruschev.

537
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:04,430
He's testing the Germans for weaknesses.

538
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:07,770
He's meticulous in his preparation.

539
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:13,970
Vodka... is a luxury we have.

540
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:17,340
Caviar is a luxury we have.

541
01:02:17,550 --> 01:02:20,180
Time is not.

542
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:23,820
He's aware of that comrade Kruschev. We both are.

543
01:02:25,790 --> 01:02:30,130
I assure you he will succeed. Good.

544
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:33,890
It seems your destinies are entwined.

545
01:02:56,450 --> 01:02:57,980
They're keeping you busy.

546
01:03:03,890 --> 01:03:05,380
I picked this up in the kitchen.

547
01:03:05,530 --> 01:03:07,660
It's from the reception the other day.

548
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:10,765
I thought Mrs.Filipov might like it.

549
01:03:10,766 --> 01:03:13,730
Um,she will be thrilled. That's very sweet of you.

550
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:17,970
There's plenty more If you're hungry.

551
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:20,010
You're Jewish, aren't you?

552
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:24,340
There's nothing in our religion that says you can't eat sturgeon.

553
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:28,980
My father had a premonition all this would happen.

554
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,110
You mean the war?

555
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:35,520
He understood that the hatred of the jews ran deep.

556
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:39,150
He was saving up to buy some land in Palestine.

557
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:43,930
He said it was the only land we truly belonged in;

558
01:03:44,370 --> 01:03:47,570
the only land we had a duty to defend.

559
01:03:48,310 --> 01:03:51,640
He insisted learn to use a rifle.

560
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:54,210
I learned to shoot.

561
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:00,010
I know that in times of war,

562
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:02,950
personal feelings should be put aside,but...

563
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:05,610
I have a favor to ask you.

564
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,120
Of course. Anything you want.

565
01:04:08,590 --> 01:04:10,750
I want to be reassigned.

566
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,490
What's happened,Tania?

567
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:42,550
He shot him.

568
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:49,190
He shot him even though he jumped first.

569
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:52,930
Shot him on the run.

570
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:57,670
It was an impossible shot. I've never seen anything like it.

571
01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:01,140
You've promised people a victory I can't deliver.

572
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:05,850
I don't stand a chance against this man.

573
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:08,110
You mustn't talk like that,Vassili.

574
01:05:09,590 --> 01:05:13,020
What if I told you we found a way to track his movements?

575
01:05:13,490 --> 01:05:15,480
We've got someone,Vassili.

576
01:05:15,790 --> 01:05:18,630
Someone close to him passing us information.

577
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:22,460
Next time you will be one step ahead of him.

578
01:05:23,870 --> 01:05:25,160
I promise.

579
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:38,240
Now I have a favor to ask.

580
01:05:39,050 --> 01:05:40,540
From me?

581
01:05:43,790 --> 01:05:45,690
It's about Tania.

582
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:52,830
Come in.

583
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,200
He doesn't even know you exist.

584
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:03,770
But at that moment,you are closer to him than anyone else on earth.

585
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:07,000
You see his face through the sight.

586
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:09,540
You see whether he shaved that morning or not.

587
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:13,780
You can see whether he's married by whether he has a wedding ring on.

588
01:06:15,790 --> 01:06:18,720
It's not like...

589
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:21,760
just firing at a distant shape, not just a uniform.

590
01:06:21,890 --> 01:06:23,790
It's a man's face.

591
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:27,090
Those faces don't go away.

592
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:33,570
They come back and they just-they get replaced by more faces.

593
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:36,540
Did Danilov ask you to tell me this?

594
01:06:36,770 --> 01:06:40,610
He likes you very much. I think he'd try anything to change your mind.

595
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:43,410
Did he tell you why I asked for the transfer?

596
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:44,940
No.

597
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:48,110
This morning,a list arrived at headquarters.

598
01:06:48,290 --> 01:06:50,980
It was a list of civilians who'd been...

599
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:56,580
rounded up and sent to Germany in a convoy... that left Stalingrad three weeks ago.

600
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:00,390
My parents were amongst them.

601
01:07:02,530 --> 01:07:05,760
After 30 kilometers, the German soldiers...

602
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:11,170
stopped the train and forced everyone out.

603
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:17,210
In the middle of a bridge, they bound them together,

604
01:07:17,350 --> 01:07:19,250
two by two.

605
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:25,250
Mothers with daughters. Husbands and wives.

606
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:30,880
They... lined them up against the railing,

607
01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:36,560
and then they fired a single shot at each pair... to save bullets.

608
01:07:37,770 --> 01:07:39,700
It worked.

609
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:45,200
The bodies of the ones who died dragged the others under the water.

610
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,810
I know they died together.

611
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:54,950
They never would have let themselves be separated.

612
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:14,130
That's Koulikov's rifle. It's a good... rifle.

613
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:25,080
Thank you.

614
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:56,740
I know how he leaves the shelter.

615
01:08:57,310 --> 01:08:59,210
He goes through the tractor factory.

616
01:08:59,350 --> 01:09:01,680
The tractor factory is big.

617
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:06,750
I know exactly where.

618
01:09:06,890 --> 01:09:10,580
He crawls through a gutter,under a grate where the vats are,

619
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:13,060
then he goes out from the workshop.

620
01:09:13,330 --> 01:09:15,730
In between the two, there's a place where he's in the open.

621
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:18,800
It's under a long,iron foot walk.

622
01:09:52,970 --> 01:09:54,630
Good luck,comrade.

623
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:43,070
I know exactly where he's waiting for me.

624
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:48,440
He'll be on the foot walk over the gutter.

625
01:11:48,590 --> 01:11:51,580
We'll take him out from behind.

626
01:12:11,170 --> 01:12:16,370
We'll get to the other end of the workshop through these pipes.

627
01:12:16,510 --> 01:12:18,070
Follow me.

628
01:14:04,290 --> 01:14:05,750
You go that way. I'll go around this way.

629
01:14:05,890 --> 01:14:10,120
Okay?

630
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:27,670
Shit!

631
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:36,980
Sergei, you should go back.

632
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:41,760
- Go back. - No,I'll be all right.

633
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,420
No,you go!

634
01:14:48,830 --> 01:14:50,770
Keep your legs in.

635
01:15:33,740 --> 01:15:38,840
Come on. Come on. Come on.

636
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:40,800
Comrade Stalin is asking for one last effort!

637
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:42,670
The fate of the motherland is at risk!

638
01:16:42,810 --> 01:16:45,510
The fate of all those you love and cherish!

639
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:48,180
It's for them that we fight today.

640
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:50,910
Listen to me,Tania.

641
01:16:51,050 --> 01:16:53,350
The Germans are throwing everything at us.

642
01:16:53,490 --> 01:16:56,650
If they're lucky,one in ten of these soldiers will come back alive.

643
01:16:56,790 --> 01:16:59,390
You're highly educated. You know languages.

644
01:16:59,530 --> 01:17:02,970
Every intercept you translate saves hundreds of lives.

645
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:06,930
Every message you decode kills thousands of theirs.

646
01:17:07,070 --> 01:17:09,160
You have a duty to survive.

647
01:17:09,310 --> 01:17:12,000
Vassili was born to fire a gun. It's what he knows.

648
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:15,510
You and I were born for a different purpose.

649
01:17:16,050 --> 01:17:19,010
If Vassili were here, he would tell you the same thing.

650
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:25,180
Where is he? Where is Vassili?

651
01:18:32,860 --> 01:18:34,880
Keep your head down.Tell me where he is.

652
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:40,150
Stay into that pipe,Tania. Stay in. Stay in! Get your head in!

653
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:51,570
Slow down. Don't shoot.

654
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:58,310
He's over there.

655
01:19:11,130 --> 01:19:15,590
Do you see the pillar in front of you?

656
01:19:16,170 --> 01:19:19,600
I need you to move round behind it.

657
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:30,300
Go.

658
01:19:32,210 --> 01:19:38,020
Tania,I need you to find a large piece of glass.

659
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:40,280
Piece of glass.

660
01:19:43,030 --> 01:19:46,120
Do you see the kiln...

661
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:49,960
behind me to the left of the factory?

662
01:19:52,270 --> 01:19:54,170
Yes? I can't hear you.

663
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:57,270
- Yes. - Yes.

664
01:19:57,470 --> 01:20:03,250
Do you see... the two louvers?

665
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:06,710
- Yes. - Do you see the one...

666
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:12,180
with a broken slat? Yes.

667
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:14,580
This is what I want you to do.

668
01:20:21,230 --> 01:20:24,260
- Are you ready? - Yes.

669
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:28,000
Three... two... one...

670
01:20:47,060 --> 01:20:48,720
Hello,Sacha.

671
01:20:55,630 --> 01:20:57,690
He was right where you said he'd be.

672
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,500
Nearly there.

673
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:06,540
He's very clever.

674
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:13,350
Tell me about him.

675
01:21:20,060 --> 01:21:24,360
Why was it his grandfather taught him how to shoot and not his father?

676
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:28,420
His father's dead. His mother too.

677
01:21:31,370 --> 01:21:33,200
Does he talk about his father?

678
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:35,800
No. He didn't know him.

679
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:39,530
Did he go to school?

680
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:43,580
He knows how to write. He answers lots of letters.

681
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:47,280
Hmm. Is it girls who write to him?

682
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:49,310
Everyone writes to him.

683
01:21:49,450 --> 01:21:51,580
Is there a girl he loves in his village?

684
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:53,380
Not in his village,here.

685
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:55,180
Does she love him?

686
01:21:55,690 --> 01:21:58,130
Yes,because he's handsome.

687
01:21:58,260 --> 01:22:01,660
Because he's brave and she's very beautiful.

688
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,890
I know her well. She's from my neighbour hood.

689
01:22:04,030 --> 01:22:05,860
She went to the university.

690
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,100
They're handsome together.Later,the two of them will get married.

691
01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:17,810
At least,I think so.

692
01:22:19,580 --> 01:22:21,280
And you,Sacha,

693
01:22:23,190 --> 01:22:25,620
why are you helping the Germans?

694
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:32,490
Because they're stronger. Because they're going to win the war.

695
01:22:32,630 --> 01:22:35,120
And because you like chocolate,huh?

696
01:22:52,150 --> 01:22:54,910
All these people here know they're gonna die.

697
01:22:55,050 --> 01:22:57,210
So each night when they make it back,

698
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:00,150
It's a bonus.

699
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:02,880
Excuse me.

700
01:23:03,860 --> 01:23:05,590
So,every cup of tea,

701
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:07,830
every cigarette...

702
01:23:09,570 --> 01:23:11,690
becomes a little celebration.

703
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:15,360
Because for a lot of us, it maybe our last night.

704
01:23:16,410 --> 01:23:19,860
It's just something you have to accept here.

705
01:23:20,910 --> 01:23:22,740
Everyone has their time.

706
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:31,040
In the forest, the wolf lives for three years,

707
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:33,190
the donkey for nine.

708
01:23:36,290 --> 01:23:40,130
So,that's- that's got to be a proverb from the Urals.

709
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:41,920
It makes no sense to me whatsoever.

710
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:45,900
The donkey lives longer because he's more useful.

711
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:47,360
Makes absolute sense.

712
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:49,870
There aren't any donkeys in the forest.

713
01:23:50,010 --> 01:23:51,530
You made it up.

714
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:58,080
So... I'm a donkey?

715
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:06,110
People like you and Danilov... have to survive this.

716
01:24:06,260 --> 01:24:09,520
People who have read books, had an education.

717
01:24:11,060 --> 01:24:13,490
We'll need you when the war is over.

718
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:15,350
And if you survive?

719
01:24:16,170 --> 01:24:20,360
What will the useless Vassili Zaitsev do then?

720
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:22,770
I wanna work in a factory.

721
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:27,440
My granddad took me to a factory once.

722
01:24:28,510 --> 01:24:35,380
There was this man there, high up on a-on a foot walk.

723
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:38,350
He wasn't wearing blue like the others.

724
01:24:38,890 --> 01:24:40,190
The people he was supervising

725
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:44,830
didn't really understand what they were doing. But for him,

726
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:48,160
for him up there, it was simple; it was clear.

727
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:50,390
And I thought,"One day,

728
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,760
I could be that man."

729
01:24:59,110 --> 01:25:02,840
Sad to have a dream you know won't happen.

730
01:25:04,510 --> 01:25:06,280
Why shouldn't it?

731
01:25:08,850 --> 01:25:12,710
You'll outlive us all. Hmm.

732
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:15,920
You'll be the oldest donkey in the forest.

733
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:35,640
"150 meters stand between the Germans and the Volga.

734
01:25:35,810 --> 01:25:38,280
"Today the whole world is watching these 150meters.

735
01:25:38,450 --> 01:25:40,010
They are what makes Stalingrad..."

736
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,810
the capitol...

737
01:25:43,490 --> 01:25:45,040
of the war.

738
01:25:50,330 --> 01:25:52,660
Your friend,Tania...

739
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:55,560
have you see her?

740
01:25:56,270 --> 01:25:59,670
She stays over there now, with the snipers.

741
01:26:00,270 --> 01:26:06,130
Tell the major we're sending in all of our sharpshooters... to support the attack on the factory.

742
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:10,440
Tell him Vassili will be there.

743
01:30:01,310 --> 01:30:03,970
- I need to talk to you. - Sure.

744
01:30:08,420 --> 01:30:10,080
- Danilov. - Hmm?

745
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:25,590
You have to stop writing about me.

746
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,770
I'm not gonna get him because I'm not good enough.

747
01:30:31,910 --> 01:30:35,210
Sooner or later,he's gonna find me, he's gonna kill me.

748
01:30:35,410 --> 01:30:37,810
I've warned you before not to talk like this.

749
01:30:40,150 --> 01:30:42,080
This time it's different.

750
01:30:44,820 --> 01:30:47,410
You've built me up...

751
01:30:47,590 --> 01:30:51,050
and up into someone I'm not.

752
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:55,460
I can't carry that weight anymore. I wanna fight.

753
01:30:56,530 --> 01:31:01,060
I want to fight just as a regular soldier.

754
01:31:01,370 --> 01:31:02,930
I understand.

755
01:31:03,210 --> 01:31:07,110
The thing is,you're not a regular soldier. You're extraordinary soldier.

756
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:09,470
No,I'm what you've made me.

757
01:31:10,950 --> 01:31:13,010
Nothing more.

758
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:19,810
Why are you telling me this now?

759
01:31:21,290 --> 01:31:23,160
Hmm? What's happened?

760
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,990
What's changed?

761
01:31:33,270 --> 01:31:35,260
Did you speak to Tania for me?

762
01:31:38,010 --> 01:31:39,340
- Yes. - Well...

763
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:42,840
will she reconsider?

764
01:31:45,810 --> 01:31:47,680
I don't know.

765
01:31:50,650 --> 01:31:54,210
She should. She'll be much safer. She should,you know that.

766
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:55,310
Yeah.

767
01:31:55,420 --> 01:31:57,920
It'll be easier to get her reassigned.

768
01:31:58,190 --> 01:32:01,360
The Germans are preparing another offensive in the city center.

769
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:04,470
The propaganda battle is crucial for morale. We need you more than ever.

770
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:06,590
Sacha. Hold on. Sacha!

771
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:12,600
Tell him what you know,Sacha.

772
01:32:12,740 --> 01:32:14,070
Hello,Sacha.

773
01:32:14,380 --> 01:32:16,280
There was dust on the major's boots.

774
01:32:16,410 --> 01:32:20,070
Sacha has the major convinced he's gone over to the other side.

775
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:23,870
I don't need to tell you the risk she's taking.

776
01:32:24,020 --> 01:32:25,180
The dust was yellow.

777
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:28,634
There's only one place where there's dust like that-

778
01:32:28,635 --> 01:32:31,120
in the back of the chemical factory, a big heap on the tracks.

779
01:32:32,650 --> 01:32:35,030
Well done.

780
01:32:35,730 --> 01:32:37,220
Sacha...

781
01:32:37,530 --> 01:32:39,760
wait for me outside then.

782
01:32:46,780 --> 01:32:48,210
- Danilov, - Hmm?

783
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:53,180
you had no right to use him.

784
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:55,310
No,no,I didn't use him.

785
01:32:55,450 --> 01:32:58,980
Vassili, he did it of his own accord.

786
01:32:59,150 --> 01:33:00,850
You know why?

787
01:33:01,220 --> 01:33:04,280
Because he believes in you!

788
01:33:10,970 --> 01:33:14,230
Tomorrow morning,we're going to take back the chemical factory.

789
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:17,730
Sacha's informed the major you'll be there,

790
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:20,600
so now you know where you have to wait for him.

791
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:21,830
In the middle of an assault.

792
01:33:21,980 --> 01:33:26,470
I'm following orders.I suggest you do the same.

793
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:30,350
Now,I'm aware of the risks.

794
01:33:31,050 --> 01:33:32,750
You'll be fine.

795
01:33:38,060 --> 01:33:39,690
Comrade.

796
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:10,020
That's the Germans up there. And yesterday was the Russians.

797
01:34:10,190 --> 01:34:11,750
We're not very far now.

798
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:15,820
Sacha...

799
01:34:17,230 --> 01:34:19,600
you're playing a very dangerous game.

800
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:22,530
I want you to win.

801
01:34:23,970 --> 01:34:27,370
See there? Keep going along the river.

802
01:34:27,510 --> 01:34:30,480
It's safe... for a while.

803
01:38:45,020 --> 01:38:47,940
Aah!

804
01:39:08,820 --> 01:39:10,150
He's dead.

805
01:39:11,030 --> 01:39:14,480
We found this on his corpse.

806
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:19,490
Your reason for being here has ceased to exist.

807
01:39:19,630 --> 01:39:21,600
Pardon me,Herr General,

808
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:24,210
but I do not believe

809
01:39:24,210 --> 01:39:29,190
There is a plane bound for Berlin tomorrow evening. You will be on it.

810
01:39:32,180 --> 01:39:35,950
Until then,I must ask you for your dog tags.

811
01:39:37,350 --> 01:39:40,950
Imagine how Russian propaganda would profit from your death.

812
01:39:41,090 --> 01:39:43,850
If you fall, you will fall unknown.

813
01:39:43,990 --> 01:39:46,460
You've already had a near miss.

814
01:39:55,100 --> 01:39:58,070
Also please take this War Merit Cross.

815
01:39:58,210 --> 01:40:02,140
It was awarded posthumously... to a lieutenant of the 116th Infantry Division...

816
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:05,680
who fell here during the first days of the battle.

817
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:08,970
He was my son.

818
01:40:11,390 --> 01:40:14,650
If the landing is captured, everything's lost!

819
01:40:16,930 --> 01:40:18,650
Come here.

820
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:26,690
What did I tell you? You've been playing your fiddle too much!

821
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:29,410
If it's confirmed that he's dead,we're sunk!

822
01:40:29,410 --> 01:40:33,240
- Well,you're sunk. - It isn't true.

823
01:40:33,370 --> 01:40:36,130
It was intercepted from their staff headquarters.

824
01:40:36,130 --> 01:40:39,840
What do they have to do, dangle his body in front of our men?

825
01:40:39,980 --> 01:40:41,540
They're lying.

826
01:40:42,350 --> 01:40:46,220
That's good. Very good.

827
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:50,220
Write it,then. "Vassili Zaitsev is not dead.

828
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:52,590
"This is what he had for breakfast this morning.

829
01:40:52,730 --> 01:40:55,890
This is a picture of him reading today's newspaper.

830
01:40:56,030 --> 01:40:57,500
" You're the poet".

831
01:40:57,730 --> 01:40:58,960
What?

832
01:40:59,100 --> 01:41:01,800
You won't give up the riverbank!

833
01:41:02,170 --> 01:41:04,950
I don't  care if you're lost half your men!

834
01:41:04,950 --> 01:41:08,470
Lose the other half, or lose yourself!

835
01:41:14,450 --> 01:41:15,880
Is he back?

836
01:41:19,290 --> 01:41:20,950
He should be back soon.

837
01:41:21,790 --> 01:41:25,280
The German attack cut the lines. That's why he's late.

838
01:41:28,660 --> 01:41:30,460
Can we go outside?

839
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:38,760
I wrote to my mother about you.

840
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:41,600
She wanted me to tell you that once this war was over,

841
01:41:41,940 --> 01:41:43,670
if there's anything you needed anything at all

842
01:41:43,810 --> 01:41:46,250
our family will be there for you.

843
01:41:48,620 --> 01:41:50,640
You know I'm here for you.

844
01:41:55,690 --> 01:41:57,990
They're saying Vassili is dead.

845
01:41:58,130 --> 01:42:02,090
Vassili Zaitsev will never see his loved ones again.

846
01:42:02,230 --> 01:42:05,530
Surrender! This is your only hope.

847
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:12,040
You're upset.

848
01:42:13,340 --> 01:42:15,610
Because Zaitsev is dead?

849
01:42:17,580 --> 01:42:20,840
You don't have to hide it. There's no shame in it.

850
01:42:21,550 --> 01:42:24,070
You're a Russian like he is.

851
01:42:26,820 --> 01:42:28,580
Don't listen to them.

852
01:42:29,220 --> 01:42:31,380
It's just propaganda.

853
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:34,190
He isn't dead.

854
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:37,130
And do you know why?

855
01:42:38,730 --> 01:42:41,130
Because I haven't killed him yet.

856
01:42:48,580 --> 01:42:50,910
I'm going to tell you a little secret.

857
01:42:51,180 --> 01:42:54,710
Only you,because I know I can trust you.

858
01:42:54,850 --> 01:42:59,120
But you must swear to me that you won't tell another soul.

859
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:02,280
You swear?

860
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:06,090
I found a terrific spot.

861
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:09,620
It's by the exit from the train station.

862
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:12,200
I'll hide in the water tower.

863
01:43:12,500 --> 01:43:15,370
Tomorrow. I'll wait for him there.

864
01:43:15,370 --> 01:43:20,670
You'll see. He'll be there.

865
01:43:20,810 --> 01:43:23,400
He always is.

866
01:43:32,590 --> 01:43:37,080
I also want you to swear that from now on,you'll stay home where you belong.

867
01:43:37,930 --> 01:43:39,450
Do you swear?

868
01:43:40,730 --> 01:43:42,320
Yes?

869
01:43:45,500 --> 01:43:46,900
Good.

870
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:49,930
"We know he's alive. We know he won't fail us.

871
01:43:50,070 --> 01:43:51,560
We know because he is a part of us now.

872
01:43:51,710 --> 01:43:53,870
Vassili is eternal."

873
01:43:56,340 --> 01:43:57,830
Where have you been?

874
01:43:57,980 --> 01:43:59,710
We've looked everywhere for you.

875
01:43:59,850 --> 01:44:01,580
Oh,didn't you hear?

876
01:44:02,150 --> 01:44:03,550
I was dead.

877
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:08,350
At least the noble sniper Zaitsev...

878
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:12,460
Vassili was dead.

879
01:44:12,590 --> 01:44:14,390
The real one.

880
01:44:16,830 --> 01:44:18,160
Me...

881
01:44:19,870 --> 01:44:21,600
I was asleep,

882
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:23,970
and I missed my chance.

883
01:44:24,110 --> 01:44:29,200
Then,I was curled up in a corner,hiding...

884
01:44:29,340 --> 01:44:31,780
from a man who wants to kill me.

885
01:44:32,310 --> 01:44:34,140
I'll talk to Kruschev.

886
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:36,710
He'll send you back to your old division.

887
01:44:37,690 --> 01:44:39,050
- Where's Tania?

888
01:44:39,190 --> 01:44:40,950
- She's at the shelter.

889
01:44:41,220 --> 01:44:42,880
I've been to the shelter.

890
01:44:43,020 --> 01:44:45,360
I told her you weren't dead.

891
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:48,990
The major said so.

892
01:44:49,130 --> 01:44:51,430
He said the other Germans were lying.

893
01:44:51,570 --> 01:44:54,660
He told me you were waiting for him at the station.

894
01:44:57,940 --> 01:44:59,430
Vassili.

895
01:45:20,290 --> 01:45:22,090
Vassili.

896
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,730
Vassili.

897
01:45:32,810 --> 01:45:38,040
My little Sacha. I knew it.

898
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:58,390
- Vassili. - Tania.

899
01:46:04,470 --> 01:46:06,410
I knew you weren't dead.

900
01:46:06,670 --> 01:46:09,310
How?

901
01:46:09,810 --> 01:46:11,680
Because we only just met.

902
01:46:15,750 --> 01:46:20,480
I prayed for the first time since I was a little girl.

903
01:46:20,920 --> 01:46:23,020
When I opened my eyes,

904
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:26,920
Sacha was standing there...waiting to give me the good news.

905
01:46:29,860 --> 01:46:32,630
I think he loves you even more than I do.

906
01:46:56,920 --> 01:46:59,260
To the proper military authority,

907
01:46:59,390 --> 01:47:01,950
I'm calling to the commandant's attention the recent changes noticed...

908
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:06,900
in the attitude towards fighting of soldier Vassili Zaitsev.

909
01:47:07,030 --> 01:47:10,530
He has attempted on several occasions to escape his duties,

910
01:47:10,670 --> 01:47:13,110
voiced doubts on the chances of our victory...

911
01:47:13,240 --> 01:47:16,010
and made defeatist comments in public.

912
01:47:16,340 --> 01:47:19,240
The inexplicable duration of his duel...

913
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:24,210
with the Nazi sharpshooter can only be explained by...

914
01:47:24,350 --> 01:47:28,020
his lack of belief in the communist ideal.

915
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:36,930
Good morning,Sacha.

916
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:42,530
Once again,he knew exactly where to find me.

917
01:47:42,940 --> 01:47:45,170
Don't you think that's strange?

918
01:47:46,340 --> 01:47:49,240
Apart from me,only you knew.

919
01:47:50,710 --> 01:47:53,150
I don't hold it against you, Sacha.

920
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:55,610
You've done a very brave thing.

921
01:47:56,650 --> 01:47:59,520
You've chosen your camp. I respect that.

922
01:47:59,650 --> 01:48:01,620
But it isn't my camp.

923
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:03,750
We're both soldiers,

924
01:48:04,490 --> 01:48:09,120
and we're both enemies, so I know you understand.

925
01:48:09,430 --> 01:48:13,960
I'm annoyed with you,little Sacha,for not staying home as I made you swear to.

926
01:48:15,100 --> 01:48:19,400
I'm annoyed with you for obliging me to do what I'm going to have to do.

927
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:28,340
I've never seen anyone frown so much in their sleep.

928
01:48:31,020 --> 01:48:33,580
How long have you been watching me?

929
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:35,690
All night.

930
01:48:36,260 --> 01:48:39,190
You've been snoring away happily for hours.

931
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:42,050
I don't snore. Do I?

932
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:43,690
Like a pig.

933
01:48:43,860 --> 01:48:46,200
I suppose I talk in my sleep as well.

934
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:48,330
Yes.

935
01:48:50,740 --> 01:48:53,000
There's something I should tell you.

936
01:49:00,450 --> 01:49:05,410
On the train... coming here...

937
01:49:07,420 --> 01:49:11,060
we were in the same car. No.

938
01:49:11,060 --> 01:49:12,790
I saw you.

939
01:49:13,590 --> 01:49:17,290
You were reading, and you fell asleep.

940
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:23,400
I didn't dare look at you, you were so beautiful.

941
01:49:24,970 --> 01:49:26,960
It was scary.

942
01:49:29,540 --> 01:49:33,240
Afterwards,I couldn't stop thinking about you.

943
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:36,040
It made me smile.

944
01:49:37,180 --> 01:49:42,140
And then I thought of all the men who would get to hold you...

945
01:49:43,990 --> 01:49:45,980
who'd make you laugh...

946
01:49:48,630 --> 01:49:50,820
how lucky they were.

947
01:49:54,070 --> 01:49:57,330
And now I'm the one lying next to you.

948
01:49:59,770 --> 01:50:02,800
- Was I snoring? - Like a pig.

949
01:50:33,890 --> 01:50:37,330
What?

950
01:50:40,850 --> 01:50:42,210
Oh,my God!

951
01:50:42,350 --> 01:50:43,910
Oh,no.

952
01:50:44,050 --> 01:50:46,110
- Oh,my God! - Tania,no.

953
01:50:46,250 --> 01:50:47,950
- Tania,no! - No,get off me!

954
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:50,550
- Get off me! Get off me! - It's what he wants!

955
01:50:50,550 --> 01:50:52,550
- Get off me! Get off me! - It's what he wants!

956
01:50:52,551 --> 01:50:54,830
- No,he'll kill you. He'll kill you! - Let me go!

957
01:50:54,830 --> 01:50:58,770
- I'll run after you,and he'll kill me. - Let me go!

958
01:50:58,900 --> 01:51:00,730
- Let me go! - This is what he wants! I'll get him.

959
01:51:00,870 --> 01:51:04,720
I promise I'll get him.

960
01:51:04,910 --> 01:51:08,430
I'll get his rifle for you. I promise,Tania.

961
01:51:27,070 --> 01:51:30,490
I need you.

962
01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:36,930
You have to leave now,Mrs.Filipov. Stalingrad may fall.

963
01:51:37,140 --> 01:51:39,630
The last of the boats are leaving. The Germans will be here any moment.

964
01:51:39,770 --> 01:51:41,170
He's brought you a pass.

965
01:51:41,310 --> 01:51:42,870
You'll be safe on the other side.

966
01:51:43,010 --> 01:51:45,880
Gather your things,and we'll help you carry them to the landing stage.

967
01:51:46,010 --> 01:51:49,470
I'm not leaving. This is my home.

968
01:51:49,620 --> 01:51:52,610
This is my Sacha's home. I can't leave.

969
01:51:52,750 --> 01:51:55,280
I have to tell you something, Mrs.Filipov.

970
01:51:57,630 --> 01:52:00,030
Something very difficult to understand.

971
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:03,090
It's about Sacha.

972
01:52:17,210 --> 01:52:18,840
He's gone over to the Germans.

973
01:52:18,980 --> 01:52:22,205
He's betrayed his country.He's with the enemy now.

974
01:52:22,206 --> 01:52:23,280
He won't be coming back.

975
01:52:25,290 --> 01:52:26,880
Oh,my God.

976
01:52:30,790 --> 01:52:32,690
Oh,my God.

977
01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:37,560
He's become a traitor.

978
01:52:38,530 --> 01:52:44,230
The poor little thing. What has he done?

979
01:52:47,010 --> 01:52:49,600
So,he's going to stay over there?

980
01:52:54,150 --> 01:52:55,640
Yes...

981
01:52:56,150 --> 01:52:58,280
he's going to stay over there.

982
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:02,820
I shouldn't be saying this,comrade Commissar,

983
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:05,050
but maybe it's for the best.

984
01:53:05,860 --> 01:53:08,450
If the Germans have won, he'll be safe.

985
01:53:08,630 --> 01:53:12,530
I know it's wrong,but perhaps he has made the right choice.

986
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:34,410
-  Oh! Oh,Tania! -  Tania?

987
01:53:35,560 --> 01:53:38,750
- Oh,Tania! - Tania!

988
01:53:39,250 --> 01:53:42,210
Oh,my God! Oh!

989
01:53:58,780 --> 01:54:00,440
I need a doctor!

990
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:03,320
A doctor!

991
01:54:07,420 --> 01:54:08,980
I have a pass. I have a pass!

992
01:54:09,120 --> 01:54:12,560
You must let her cross.

993
01:54:14,450 --> 01:54:17,050
Please!

994
01:54:17,200 --> 01:54:18,990
It's useless. She'll never make it.

995
01:54:19,130 --> 01:54:20,760
No! No,she will!

996
01:54:21,100 --> 01:54:23,760
She's my daughter! She's my daughter!

997
01:54:23,900 --> 01:54:26,240
- I beg of you! - All right.

998
01:54:26,470 --> 01:54:30,470
- Oh,thank you! - Put this one on the boat.

999

1000
01:55:15,930 --> 01:55:19,390
Where is he?

1001
01:55:19,890 --> 01:55:21,420
Where's the major?

1002
01:55:21,560 --> 01:55:23,810
A few inches from your face.

1003
01:55:23,810 --> 01:55:29,440
I've been such a fool, Vassili.

1004
01:55:29,660 --> 01:55:33,770
Man will always be man.

1005
01:55:33,770 --> 01:55:35,940
There is no new man.

1006
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:40,510
We tried so hard to create a society that was equal,

1007
01:55:40,650 --> 01:55:43,630
where there'd be nothing to envy your neighbor.

1008
01:55:43,630 --> 01:55:48,090
But there's always something to envy.

1009
01:55:48,660 --> 01:55:50,620
A smile...

1010
01:55:51,130 --> 01:55:52,920
a friendship.

1011
01:55:54,090 --> 01:55:57,960
Something you don't have and want to appropriate.

1012
01:55:58,300 --> 01:56:02,700
In this world even a Soviet one

1013
01:56:02,840 --> 01:56:05,400
there will always be rich and poor.

1014
01:56:06,970 --> 01:56:09,240
Rich in gifts...

1015
01:56:10,440 --> 01:56:12,540
poor in gifts.

1016
01:56:13,450 --> 01:56:15,350
Rich in love...

1017
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:18,880
poor in love.

1018
01:56:24,860 --> 01:56:27,450
Tania isn't coming back.

1019
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:31,690
She's dead,Vassili.

1020
01:56:39,810 --> 01:56:42,210
She was cut down by shrapnel.

1021
01:56:42,340 --> 01:56:47,250
It was quick.I don't think she even saw it coming.

1022
01:56:47,780 --> 01:56:49,720
She was on her way back to you.

1023
01:56:49,850 --> 01:56:53,250
As soon as she had seen Mrs.Filipov to the boats,

1024
01:56:53,390 --> 01:56:55,580
she was coming back for you.

1025
01:56:55,790 --> 01:57:00,590
She was right. You're a good man,Vassili.

1026
01:57:04,030 --> 01:57:06,660
I want to help you, Vassili.

1027
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:09,200
Let me do one last thing.

1028
01:57:09,340 --> 01:57:12,740
Something useful for a change.

1029
01:57:17,780 --> 01:57:19,340
Let me show you where the major is.

1030
01:57:19,510 --> 01:57:20,950
Don't do that.

1031
01:57:21,150 --> 01:57:22,380
Don't do that!

1032
02:01:36,600 --> 02:01:40,100
Today,February3,1943, is an ominous day for Hitler...

1033
02:01:40,240 --> 02:01:46,250
and the endless columns of hundreds of thousands of German prisoners.

1034
02:01:46,250 --> 02:01:54,350
It is an unforgettable day of hope for our motherland.

1035
02:02:02,660 --> 02:02:06,890
After 180 days of heroic combat...

1036
02:02:07,030 --> 02:02:09,370
in the market city of Stalingrad,

1037
02:02:09,540 --> 02:02:14,470
and as a result of the valor and self-sacrifice of our soldiers,

1038
02:02:14,640 --> 02:02:17,770
the commander of our glorious Red Army...

1039
02:02:17,910 --> 02:02:26,940
received the unconditional surrender... of the German fascist invaders.

1040
02:02:37,430 --> 02:02:38,660
Sorry. No,young man,

1041
02:02:39,430 --> 02:02:43,460
- I cannot find...a matching name in the book. - Could you check again?

1042
02:02:43,600 --> 02:02:46,000
- This is the address and her name. - She is not here.

1043
02:02:46,140 --> 02:02:50,800
Yes,this is our address, but we don't have her anymore.

1044
02:02:51,010 --> 02:02:52,740
- This is the address. She's been here. - I'm so sorry.

1045
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:54,400
She wrote to me.

1046
02:02:54,550 --> 02:02:56,540
I looked three times. She's not here.

1047
02:02:56,680 --> 02:03:01,120
Believe me,there is no Tania Chernova. I can't help you.

1048
02:03:01,250 --> 02:03:04,380
I'm so sorry.
