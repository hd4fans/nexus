1
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,166
Dottie!

2
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,000
Dottie 该死, 起来!
Dottie, God damn it, wake up!

3
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,966
闭嘴， T-Bone！
Shut up, T-Bone!

4
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,369
Dottie 该死的，Dottie 让我进去！ T-Bone 你给我闭嘴！
God damn it, Dottie, let me in!T-Bone, shut up!

5
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,809
Dottie!

6
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,644
赶快起来！
Wake Up!

7
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,006
Dottie!

8
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,966
开门！ Dottie！
Open the goddamn door! Dottie!

9
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,883
赶快起来给我开门！
Get out of that fucking bed right fucking now!

10
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,647
Dottie， 开门！
Dottie, open this door!

11
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,484
Dottie!

12
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,127
Dottie， 开门！ 。。。Dottie！
Dottie, please open the door! ...Dottie!

13
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,722
Dottie，我快尿在裤子里啦！
Dottie, I gotta take a piss!

14
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,084
醒醒，是我！
Wake up, it's me!

15
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,800
妈的！
Shit!

16
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,961
等等！
Hold on!

17
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,004
开门！ 来啦来啦！
- Open the goddamn door!- I'm coming, just a second.

18
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,206
闭嘴！
Shut up!

19
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,641
哦，卖糕的，看在巴依老爷的份上，穿上点衣服！
Oh, God, put some clothes on, for Christ's sake!

20
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,251
嘿，我又不知道谁在敲门！
Well, hell, I didn't know who you were.

21
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,891
妈的
Shit.

22
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,329
关上门！好伐！
Close the goddamn door!

23
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,846
你都不知道谁叫门，你就这一身去开门？
You answer the door like that,if you don't know who the hell it is?

24
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,331
你又不是没见过
Nothing you never seen before.

25
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,880
至少达拉斯一半的人木有见过
Nothing half of Dallas County hasn't seen before.

26
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,961
妈的，闭嘴
Shut up.

27
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,804
我爸在么？
Dad here?

28
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,530
他睡了
He's asleep.

29
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,364
Dottie 在么？
Dottie's here, ain't she?

30
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,002
Adele把你扔出来了？ -不，我想跟我爸聊聊
- Did Adele throw you out? - No, I need to talk to Dad.

31
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,884
她把你扔出来了？ 你丫又打她了吧？
Why'd she throw you out? Did you hit her again?

32
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,564
哪有， 我才没有打她
No, I didn't hit her.

33
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,051
嘿 听着
Hey' look,

34
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,202
你能去穿上点什么？
would you please put some clothes on?

35
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,011
俄滴神，你就别唧唧歪歪了
- My God, I never heard so much... 
那太他妈分神了
- It's a bit distracting.

36
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,003
你的灌木丛（阴毛）正在盯着我
Your bush staring me in the face.

37
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,445
好吧，真受不了你
All right! Jesus.

38
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,045
去他的
God damn it!

39
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,044
自便吧
Help yourself.

40
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,248
这是啥？
What'd you do?
切了点三叶草？
Chop up some clover?

41
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,651
哪来的这玩意？
Where'd you get this shit?

42
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,563
从你那买的
I bought it from you.

43
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,930
是吗？
This is that?

44
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,921
你来干嘛？
What are you doing here?

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,525
Adele把它扔出来了
Adele threw him out.

46
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,887
又咋了？他自己会说
So what? The boy can talk.

47
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,485
我需要找个住处，好伐！
I need a place to stay' all right?

48
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,927
为什么她踢你出来？
Why'd she throw you out?

49
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,211
说来话长
It's a long story.

50
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,323
Sharra，给我一瓶啤酒
Sharla, get me a beer.

51
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,368
你丫做了什么？又打她了？
What'd you do? Hit her again?

52
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,721
没有，该死！我没动过她
No, God damn it! I didn't hit her.

53
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,201
听起来像你从来没打过她似的
It's not like you never hit her before.

54
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,203
关你屁事，Sharla
This ain't none of your goddamn business, Sharla.

55
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,408
嘿，这是我的地方
- Hey, I live here.
蛋定，好伐！
- Calm down.

56
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,562
听着，老爸，我必须接受你那光屁股老婆
Listen, Dad, I gotta listen to your naked wife

57
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,483
对我的审问？
- giving me the third degree?
你哪只眼看见我光着
- I'm not naked.

58
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,768
为什么你不让他赶快滚蛋
Why do you let her walk around here like that'?

59
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,001
什么？
- Like what?
都大半夜啦
- It's the middle Of the night.

60
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,048
她就挺着她那海獭皮出来开的门
She answered the door with her beaver puckered out

61
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,122
好像很随意的想跟你打招呼似的
- like it was trying to shake my hand.
你给我闭嘴
- You hush your mouth'

62
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,124
她又不认识你（估计这女的是个妓女）
- She didn't know who you were.
那不是重点，该死
- That ain't the point, God damn it.

63
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,249
我可不想Dottie见到她继母的私处
I don't want Dottie looking at her own stepmother's pussy.

64
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,850
够了， 我要去睡了
That's it. I'm going to bed.

65
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,410
我可不想听你扯蛋一整夜
I've heard all the shit I can take in one night.

66
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,209
晚安了您呐
Good night.

67
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,209
你个小屎蛋，我会杀了你的
You little shit, I'm going to fucking kill you!

68
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,091
住手
- Cut it out!
梦见俺哈！
- Sweet dreams!

69
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,127
老娘阉了你！
- ...kill you!
去屎
- Damn it.

70
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,929
抽你丫的大麻烟
Enough on the weed!

71
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,166
他就留一晚上
He can stay here tonight!

72
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,969
嘿， 老子想留多久就多久！
Hey, I'll stay as long as I goddamn feel like it!

73
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,283
他要敢留下，老娘负责任的保证绝对废了丫
If he stays here any longer, I'm liable to hurt the little bastard!

74
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,522
蛋定点洗洗睡吧
- Don't go to bed mad.
晚安！
- Good night! Fucker!

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,082
别睡死过去了哈
- Don't die in your sleep!
你才去屎吧！乡巴佬
- Goddamn hick!

76
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,285
这他妈是哪一出啊
What the fuck?

77
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,011
真他妈够乱的
- Now I'm in the fucking doghouse.
嘿，去穿你的裤子
- Hey, put some pamts on

78
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,684
我要跟你聊聊
I need to talk to you about something.

79
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,127
跟裤子有毛关系
- I need pants for that?
我们要出去谈
- So we can get out of here.

80
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,521
我可不想出去
- I'm not going out.
走吧，有些事得私下谈
- Come on, this is private stuff.

81
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,443
去他妈的悄悄话
Then fucking whisper!

82
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,841
去穿你的裤子！
I need you to put some pants on.

83
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,967
别想
- No.
赶快
- Come on.

84
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,051
我需要6000块，不然有人会来杀我的
I need $6,000 or some guys are gonna kill me.

85
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,849
你丫最好跑路，越快越好
You'd better get out of town, quick.

86
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,645
1000也成
- If you could just give me $1,000?
我可没有
- I don't have it.

87
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,609
嘿，1000块可能可以推脱一下他们
Hey, I could hold them off with $1,000.

88
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,330
这个，真没有
Chris, I do not have it.

89
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,211
假如不是老妈，我可不会趟这混水
I wouldn't be in this mess if it weren't for Mom.

90
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,601
这下好，她把我踢出来了
Then she goes and kicks me out.

91
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,329
你打她了，是么
You hit her, didn't you?

92
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,686
去他的，木有啊，木有！
God damn it, no!

93
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,762
我没打过她，我保证
I didn't hit her, I told you.

94
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,763
那她为啥踢你出家门？
Why'd she kick you out?

95
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,527
我只是把她扔向了冰箱而已
I threw her up against the fridge.

96
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,523
她偷了我二两白粉
She stole two ounces of coke from me.

97
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,126
瞎扯，Adele 不吸白面
That's bullshit. Adele doesn't snort cocaine.

98
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,164
她把它卖了
She sold it.

99
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,250
卖给了该死Rex，导致了后面这滩烂事
Gave it away to that goddamn Rex,'cause the shit's gone.

100
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,721
只有她一个人知道我把东西藏在哪
She was the only other one knew where it was. Then tonight,

101
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,646
今晚，她开着她那金灿灿的车来的，牌子像是Watch
she comes up to the house with her car running like a watch.

102
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,645
Which？金灿灿的凯迪拉克（Limousine Which)？扯蛋吧你
Which? The gold Cadillac? You're shitting me.

103
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,485
你扯蛋吧，那玩意几年没见过了
- Piece of shit hadn't run in years
我讲的是真的
- What'd I tell you?

104
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,643
我的玩意没了，然后就来了一帮家伙说要干掉我
So my blow is gone and now these guys are gonna kill me.

105
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,161
不敢相信是我亲生母亲干的
And my own mother for Christ's sake.

106
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,811
然后。。。
so...?

107
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,444
神马？
- Huh? What?
你会借给我钱的,是吧
- You gonna loan me the money?

108
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,488
没门
- No.
伙计，我够倒霉啦
- Man, I'm fucked.

109
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,841
我这辈子都没有过1000块
I hadn't had $1,000 in my whole life.

110
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,445
怎么会？
How'd you like to?

111
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,841
我怎么听说你有15000？
- How'd you like to have $15,000?
神呐
- Jesus.

112
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,490
别急，听我说
No, just hear me out.

113
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,603
每次都这样，你那农场呢？
Every goddamn time, What about the farm?

114
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,125
别跟我提这茬
Leave the farm out of it.

115
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,043
让我们想点更容易的方法
I'm talking about something way easier than that.

116
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,406
嗯
Ugh!

117
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,290
一定要好一点的
This ought to be good.

118
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,488
你听说过Joe Cooper么？
You ever hear of Joe Cooper?

119
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,328
没有
- No.
他是条子
- He's a cop.

120
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,243
实际上是个警探
A detective, actually.

121
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,847
好吧
Okay.

122
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,764
他也有点自己的小买卖
He's got a little business on the side

123
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,921
他做什么
What's he do?

124
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,204
杀手，杀点人啥滴
He's a killer. He kills people.

125
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,960
好吧，然后？
Yeah. so?

126
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,051
老妈有了一份50000块的人寿保险
Mom's got a $50,000 life insurance policy.

127
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,240
别他妈这样看着我
Don't look at me like that.

128
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,448
好吧，你。。你。。你会怎么想这回事？
Well, who's the...What do you call it?

129
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,761
受益人
Beneficiary.

130
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,444
- Dottie.
- Dottie?

131
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,130
全部的？50000块？
- The whole thing? The whole $50,000?
是啊
- Yup.

132
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,685
她一点都没留给我？
She didn't leave nothing to me?

133
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,287
当然是这样，你个混球，为什么要留给你什么？
Of course not, you dipshit, Why would she do that?

134
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,805
我是她前夫
I'm her ex-husband.

135
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,326
你明白的，老爸，她恨你！
She hates you, Dad. You know that.

136
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,647
那玩意她花了多少钱？
How much something like that cost?

137
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,688
我听说是20
Well, I hear he charges 20.

138
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,842
20000？俄滴神啊
Thousand? Jesus.

139
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,730
听着， 这不是什么我们常说的亲自去分一份的事
Listen, this isn't really something we can cut corners on.

140
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,007
我想说的是，这个不值得亲自动手
I'd say it's worth it not to get caught.

141
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,801
我的意思是，杀手Joe会把它完成的很好的
I mean, Killer Joe's a professional He'll do this right.

142
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,724
你怎么知道的？哪个丫告诉你的？
How do you know? Who told you about this?

143
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,450
这个无关紧要
Never mind that.

144
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,087
我想用保险受益的钱雇用他
I want to hire him on spec Ask him to do it for free

145
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,367
这样实际上它是免费帮我们做的
and then give him a cut of the insurance money.

146
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,966
好吧，我们付清他的钱以后
Well, after we pay this guy

147
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,761
我们净的30000
- and we clear $30,000
30000
- 30 thousand.

148
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,241
我们需要分4份
- We split in four ways
3份
- Three ways.

149
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,800
你怎么算的
- How do you figure?
你，我，我妹
- You, me and Dottie.

150
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,006
Sharla呢？
What about Sharla?

151
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,687
跟她有什么关系？
What about her?

152
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,921
她得分一份
She gets a cut.

153
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,604
她又不是家里的一员
The hell she does, She ain't family.

154
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,728
她比你妈在我身边的时间还常
She's been my wife longer than Adele was.

155
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,767
那是小钱
It's less money.

156
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,080
对你来说是小钱
It's less money for you.

157
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,244
那你就会多拿一份啦
And it's more money for you.

158
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,651
我是家里老大
I'm the father here.

159
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,526
是我找上了她，我是我前妻
I found her, She's my ex-wife.

160
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,170
不是你，也不是你妹
Not you, Not Dottie.

161
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,164
好吧，听你的，分成4份
Okay, fine. We'll just split it four ways.

162
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,807
我也很不爽一无所有，好伐
I ain't agreeing to nothing, okay?

163
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,926
我们谈的是杀人
This is murder we're talking about.

164
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,608
我又不是来听你扯蛋的
I'm not just gonna stand here nodding my head.

165
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,051
让我们换一种看法，她让所有人高兴过么？
Look at it this way. Is she doing anybody any good?

166
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,246
嘛意思？
What do you mean?

167
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,529
有谁关心老妈在不在？
Is anybody gonna care if Mom's not around any more?

168
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,364
是啊，Rex
Yeah. Rex.

169
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,245
那家伙对什么都会吸一鼻子的
Son of a bitch screws anything draws breath.

170
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,449
那也不代表他不关心
- That doesn't mean he doesn't care.
他需要被挑逗一下的
- He'd be tickled pink.

171
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,568
你最好去瞧瞧她怎么对到哪个可怜的家伙
You should see the way she treats that poor bastard.

172
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,010
可能跟当你对付我一样
Probably about the same way she treated me.

173
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,609
怎么才能让我妹过好点
What's better for Dottie?

174
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,365
有10000块，这样她就能进亚马逊中学了
Having $10,000, so she can go to that Amazon school

175
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,081
或者继续跟一个丑陋的，衰老的，酗酒的老妈生活
or having a beat-up, old, ugly, naggy alcoholic mother

176
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,288
继续这样活20年
for another 20 years or so?

177
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,726
我明白了
- I see your point.
太好了
- Exactly.

178
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,371
在我妹不知道我们谈了什么的时候
So long as Dottie never knows what we're talking about.

179
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,207
我们已经开始帮她了
We're really doing her a favour.

180
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,566
是啊
Yeah.

181
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,048
你在做啥
What are you doing here?

182
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,885
跟妈吵了一架
Got in a fight with Mom.

183
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,171
你自己搭建了你的农场？
You build this city all by yourself?

184
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,246
是啊
Yeah.

185
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,086
当然
Sure did.

186
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,450
一块块搭起来的
Brick by brick.

187
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,568
在婚礼的时候我听说了
I heard that at the wedding.

188
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,928
奶奶的，把哥吓尿了
Scared the shit out of me.

189
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,527
梦游真的让人毛骨悚然
Sleep talking gives me the creeps.

190
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,768
是啊，越来越糟了
Yeah. Gotten worse.

191
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,969
每天都会
About every night.

192
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,726
她看不到任何人，是吧
She's not seeing anybody yet?

193
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,885
别害怕
Don't hold your breath.

194
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,681
古人云，那个啥是不会被上身的，那啥？你懂的
Truth be told, I think she's still a... You know.

195
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,000
啥？
What?

196
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,320
处吕？
A virgin?

197
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,726
我会打电话给他
Let me just call him.

198
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,041
至少让我们见面聊聊
And at least just set up a meet and talk to the guy.

199
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,805
我们还没最终决定。
We don't got to decide anything right now.

200
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,962
- ANSEL Okay.
- Okay. good.

201
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,408
我听到你们讨论杀老妈的事
I heard y'all talking about killing Momma.

202
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,048
我想这是个好主意
I think it's a good idea.

203
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,001
好吧，我看行
Well, there you go.

204
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,926
我们谈的是谋杀
This is murder we're talking about.

205
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,209
那会很困难
That looks hard.

206
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,486
你是谁
Who are you?

207
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,442

Joe Cooper. Joe Cooper.

208
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,488
你把姐吓尿了
You scared me to death.

209
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,771
对不起
Excuse me.

210
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,689
我道歉
And I apologise.

211
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,286
我敲了门，你电视太大声了
I knocked on the door, but you had the TV on too loud

212
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,409
我就决定自己进来了
to hear me, so I decided to let myself in.

213
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,446
好吧
It's okay.

214
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,604
从电视上学那会很困难
That looks hard. From a TV like that.

215
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,490
你应该找个老师
You should have a teacher.

216
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,610
我是Joe Copper
I'm Joe Cooper.

217
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,366
我是来见Chris的，我们约的10点半
I'm supposed to meet Chris here at 10:30.

218
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,249
他不在
He's not here.

219
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,526
我是来得早了点
Well, I'm a little early.

220
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,329
他通常都会迟到的
He's usually late.

221
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,171
我能麻烦你倒杯咔灰么？
Could I trouble you for a cup of coffee?

222
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,326
当然
Sure.

223
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,563
请坐，让我帮你把外套挂起来
Why don't you sit down and I'll take your jacket.

224
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,841
嗯，谢谢
Mmm-hmm. Thank you.

225
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,481
你叫啥？
Can I ask your name?

226
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,884
我是Dottie
I'm Dottie.

227
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,405
你好，Dottie
Hello, Dottie.

228
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,686
你好
Hi.

229
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,927
啥？
What?

230
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,165
你是啥来着？
What are you?

231
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,490
我是问，你干啥来着？
I mean, what do you do?

232
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,010
我是警探
I'm a detective.

233
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,885
真的？
- Really?
嗯
- Mmm-hmm.

234
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,405
像侦探玛格农（1980米国电视剧）
Like Magnum P.I?

235
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,811
不
No.

236
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,042
他是私家侦探
He's a private detective.

237
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,091
我是达拉斯警探
I'm in the Dallas Police Department.

238
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,288
他是虚构的
- He ain't real, either...
是啊
- No.

239
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,521
我是真的
I'm real.

240
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,849
书里的汽车追逐都很刺激
I read it's nothing like them shows with car chases and all.

241
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,684
看的很仔细啊
A lot of paperwork.

242
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,009
书里的很多警探
I read some policemen go their whole lives

243
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,764
一辈子都没开过枪
without shooting their guns.

244
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,410
那可能是真的
Probably true.

245
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,570
你从来没有丢掉过你的枪？
- You ever drawn your gun?
当然
- Oh, sure.

246
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,246
你有射过谁么？
You ever shot anybody?

247
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,762
。。。有
- Yes.
谁？
- Who?

248
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,883
你不认识
Nobody you'd know.

249
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,246
射死了么？
Did they die?

250
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,967
。。。是啊，死了
Well, they have. Yes.

251
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,086
Wow.

252
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,445
这辈子最刺激的事是神马？
What's the most exciting thing that's ever happened?

253
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,210
唔。。。。
Hmm.

254
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,202
我走进了一所房子。。。
I went into this house.

255
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,485
听到可怕的惊叫声
I heard an awful screaming coming from

256
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,409
从后面传出
inside in the back.

257
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,609
那里一片黑暗
And it was pitch dark.

258
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,087
于是我好奇的跟着惊叫声来到了后面的卧室
So I followed the sound of the scream back to a bedroom.

259
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,643
但是我不知道会有什么在那里等待着我
And I didn't kno what the hell to expect.

260
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,846
Yeah.

261
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,926
当我打开门，突然。。。哇！
When I opened the door suddenly just... Whap!

262
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,762
有个胖子
There's this huge, fat man

263
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,410
在我头顶
was on top of me.

264
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,447
尖叫着，挣扎着
- Screaming and kicking and clawing
俄滴神啊！
- Oh, my God.

265
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,724
我看到的是
And the thing was,

266
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,921
这里空空荡荡没有其他人
there was nobody else even there.

267
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,529
他没有恶意，只是想我帮帮他
And he wasn't trying to hurt me, He wanted me to help him.

268
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,846
为啥？
Why?

269
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,200
你看， 他只是跟她铝盆友吵了一架
See, he got into a fight with his girlfriend, right?

270
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,681
因为她被发现劈了腿
She'd been having an affair, so...

271
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,927
为了教训一下她
In order to teach her a lesson.

272
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,044
他说的
That's what he said.

273
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,409
为了教训一下她
"Teach her a lesson."

274
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,051
他把鸡鸡插入了某种溶液
He doused his genitals with lighter fluid

275
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,282
并点上了火
and he set them on fire.

276
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,284
你相信么？
You believe that?

277
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,130
那是真的
It's true.

278
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:25,687
那个脑残的家伙点着了自己的鸡鸡
That poor miserable bastard set his own genitals on fire

279
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,525
只是想教训一下他的铝盆友
just to teach his girlfriend a lesson.

280
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,809
我想他铝盆友看过了
I guess he showed her.

281
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,328
我只是想知道那个铝的能否接受眼前的一切
I wonder if she ever got over it.

282
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,122
他还好么？
- Was he all right?
不
- No.

283
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,846
不，他一点一不all right
No, he was not all right.

284
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,167
你的鸡鸡烧了
He set his genitals on fire.

285
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,650
我有个阿姨有次也把自己烧着了
I had an aunt who set herself on fire once.

286
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,761
是吗？
Yeah?

287
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,081
不是故意的，当时她穿着长蕾丝裙子
Not on purpose, though. She was wearing this long lace dress

288
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,083
被火炉给勾住了
and she got it caught in the furnace.

289
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,447
在他们铺面火焰之前，她就屎了
She died before they could put the fire out.

290
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,965
是吗？
Really?

291
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,684
他们说，他是这个家族中我长得最像的人
They say she's the one in the family I look the most like.

292
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,650
他叫Vivah，一个很好听的名字。
Her name was Vivah. Isn't that a pretty name?

293
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,051
唔
Mmm-hmm.

294
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,724
我想她还没来得及结婚
I don't think she ever got married, though.

295
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,685
你不接电话么？
You gonna answer that?

296
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,044
那是找你的
It's for you.

297
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,491
我爸正在上班
My dad couldn't get away from work.

298
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,404
我想我们是否去Bob Muffler
I was wondering if you could meet us at Bob's Muffler.

299
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,248
那里有什么好地方适合密谈么？
There's some place private where we can talk?

300
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,971
这里有个池塘边的小山坡，下班后
There's a pool hall next door, out of business.

301
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,883
就在哈利 海恩斯旁边
Just off Harry Hines.

302
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,208
带上Dottie，她认得路
Bring Dottie, she'll show you the way.

303
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,042
听着，别再改计划。
Don't change plans on me again.

304
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,888
真的很抱歉
Listen, I'm really sorry.

305
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,449
你再搞大声点吧
Could you try to make a little more noise...

306
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,923
你为什么不来舔舔俺的屁股，杂种！
Why don't you try kissing my ass? Son of a bitch.

307
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,890
你会去杀我妈么？
Are you gonna kill my momma?

308
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,565
不知道
I don't know.

309
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,127
为啥？
- Why?
我得谨慎一点
- I was just curious.

310
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,366
当我很小的时候我妈曾经想杀我
My momma tried to kill me when I was real little.

311
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,646
她放了个枕头在我脸上
She put a pillow over my face,

312
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,371
她关心自己比自己的孩子多
because she cared more about herself than her little baby.

313
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,683
她不象母亲一样爱过我
She didn't love me like a momma should love a little baby.

314
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,081
但是她自己却觉得很满意自己
And she was happy, because she thought she'd done it.

315
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,447
于是我得成长就走向了她自己曾经的那样
And then I couldn't grow into something better than she'd been.

316
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,010
一模一样
Had ever been.

317
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,441
她从来没有，从来不允许我见我得父亲
She hadn't done it. She didn't send me back to Him.

318
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,762
她让我恶心，但是也成功了一小段时间
She just made me sick. Made me not be for a while.

319
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,410
但是我也慢慢明白了
But then I was.

320
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,602
她很失望， 但是也没法改变
She was sad that I was, and I always will be.

321
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,524
你是肿么知道的？
How do you know that?

322
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,491
知道啥？
Know what?

323
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,408
知道你妈想杀你？
That your mother tried to kill you?

324
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,609
我记得啊
Because I remember.

325
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,528
这是我爸， Ansel
This is my father, Ansel.

326
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,361
Ansel.

327
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,485
啤酒？
Like a beer?

328
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,770
不，不了，谢谢
No. No, thank you. Look.

329
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,808
听着，我可没太多时间，所以。。。
I don't have a lot of time, so...

330
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,360
好吧，让我开始吧
Alright Let's get right To it.

331
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,643
假如你们准备好了
If that's all right.

332
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,562
好吧，首先
All right. Well, first Off,

333
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,490
我和我爸从来没做过这个
me and my father never done nothing like this before.

334
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,047
我们也不想做，但是必须发生
We don't want to do it, but it's got to be done.

335
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,131
这跟我没关系
That's got nothing to do with me.

336
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,326
好吧
All right.

337
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,249
好吧，先生
Well, sir

338
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,170
把这段忘掉，也许你能帮我们回答几个疑问
instead of me kicking this off, maybe you could tell us the questions

339
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,931
我们需要提问么？
- we need to ask?
很简单
- It's pretty simple.

340
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,002
你们会负我钱的，是么？
You're gonna pay me for a service that I'm going to perform.

341
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,326
嗯
Uh-huh.

342
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,165
你们会提供她的日程表
You're going to give me the particulars of her schedule.

343
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,244
她日常习惯，我希望有个参照
Her habits. I'll act on them accordingly.

344
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,011
并且，我不会告诉你们我具体行动计划
I won't give you many details on my activities,

345
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,162
因为，你们知道越少
because the less you know,

346
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,401
越不容易被关联进来
the better for everyone involved.

347
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,365
好的
All right.

348
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,330
现在说说我的一些条件
Now I only have a couple of rules that I insist on sticking to.

349
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,004
必须遵守的
- Insist.
好的
- Okay. Yeah.

350
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,323
一旦你们被抓，一旦你们被指认犯了罪
If you're caught, if you're implicated in this crime,

351
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,290
你们要保证不会
you are not under any circumstances to reveal

352
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,528
指认我或者出庭作证
my identity or participation.

353
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,090
哦，当然
Oh, of course.

354
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,289
假如你们违反了
If you break this rule,

355
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,840
总有人会收拾你们
you'll be killed.

356
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,681
你懂的
Do you understand?

357
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,366
- I...
我必须得确认你们明白
- I must be absolutely clear

358
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,487
这些条件
on this point.

359
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,770
我懂了
I understand.

360
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,330
你呢？
Do you understand?

361
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,406
我也懂了
Yeah.

362
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,762
我的报酬是，预付25000，现金
My payment is $25,000 in cash in advance.

363
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,887
必须预付
No exceptions.

364
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,643
- 25?
是的
- Yes, sir.

365
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,807
我听说是20000
- I thought you said 20.
别人告诉我是20000
- I was told 20.

366
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,041
25.

367
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,246
这个，有问题么？
Is that a problem?

368
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,847
没问题，咱不差钱
We don't have a problem with 25 That's not our problem.

369
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,848
那你的问题是神马？
Then what is your problem?

370
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,446
我们有点困难在于，预付
We have a problem with the advance.

371
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,800
不带后付款的
- No exceptions.
听我解释
- Sir, let me explain.

372
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,121
我们决定做这个的一个目的
One of the reasons we're interested in having this done

373
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,682
实际上是我妈有一大笔保险金
is my mother holds a very large insurance policy.

374
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,727
好吧，又一个
They usually do.

375
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,928
我们能保证一定付给你
Now we thought if we can guarantee payment

376
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,082
当我们拿到保险金
after the policy had been covered...

377
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,084
听着，这个没得谈
Look, this really isn't open for discussion.

378
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,323
谈话结束
- The conversation is finished.
蛋定，蛋定
- Please. this isn't...

379
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,406
你以为你们在干嘛？
What did you think this was huh?

380
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,164
你能接受麽？
Let's Make A Deal?

381
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,449
这是严肃的事情，别tm在这里扯蛋了
This is serious business you're fucking with here, boy.

382
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,649
我真的明白
- I'm aware of that.
不，我不这样认为
- No, I don't think you are.

383
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,002
你并没有认真听我说
I don't take you seriously.

384
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,169
总会有各种方法去完成的
This is gonna get done one way or another.

385
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,320
我们的谈话到此结束
Our conversation is finished. I never met you.

386
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,521
你们从没见过我
You never met me.

387
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,161
当然，我们也没机会讨论什么预付“好处费”
Of course, we never discussed the possibility of a retainer.

388
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,404
你这啥意思？
What do you mean?

389
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,482
你知道肿么找到我
You know how to reach me.

390
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,528
给我电话，假如她真感兴趣
Call me if she's interested.

391
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,083
嘿，你说的是我妹？
Hey, man, you talking about my sister?

392
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,089
当然是你妹啊
Is that who she is?

393
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,171
俄滴神啊
Jesus.

394
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,762
他神马意思 “retainer”
What's he mean, "retainer"?

395
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,604
你以为，他说的是我妹啊
What do you think he means? He means Dottie.

396
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,089
我是问神马是Retainer
But retain what exactly?

397
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,131
你脑残么？你真的不知道？
Just how stupid are you? Are you really that stupid?

398
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,284
注意你的语气
- Watch your fucking mouth!
这下我们肿么办，老爹？
- What are we gonna do, Dad? Huh?

399
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,805
让我们再想想
We gotta think of something.

400
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,326
我们自己也能干掉她
- We could kill her ourselves!
你真的准备去杀人？
- Are you gonna kill somebody?

401
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,131
你连手表都不会看
You can't even tell time!

402
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,771
那好，你倒是告诉我要肿么办，小屁孩儿
Well, what do you suggest, smart-ass?

403
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,366
好吧，事情总会过去的
Well, we can forget about the whole thing.

404
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,010
或许。。。
Or we can

405
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,450
我们可以给他 Dottie
give him Dottie.

406
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,846
是啊，也许对她也是好事
Yeah, it might just do her some good.

407
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,884
别傻了，没人会再见到他们了
Don't be silly. Nobody's ever gonna see them.

408
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,124
你担心个毛线
What are you so worried about anyway?

409
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,050
你又不会见到他们
It's not like you can see your face in any of them.

410
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,810
你在唠嗑？
- Personal call?
- Uh-uh

411
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,167
两个大号意大利腊肠披萨
Two large pepperoni pizzas, please.

412
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,047
冲印店就在商场后面
That photo shop behind the mall.

413
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,925
你担心太多了
You worry too much.

414
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,650
只是些满脸疙瘩的青涩小铝孩
Just some pimply-faced lime girl

415
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,449
谁没见过一两回
who never seen one before in her life.

416
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,163
没啥大不了的事
Nothing that big anyway.

417
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,641
你多久来接我
What time you gonna pick me up?

418
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,202
8点半？那你还指望我能做什么？
8:30? What do you expect me to do until then?

419
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,321
等等，Jenny
Hold on, Jenny.

420
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,051
能给点钱给我吃晚饭么？
Can I have some money so I can fix supper?

421
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,691
Jenny，下班后我给你电话
Jenny, I gotta call you after my shift.

422
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,001
现在不行。。。
I can't' I have to... Yeah.

423
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,730
我也是
Yeah, me, too.

424
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,444
你准备吃什么？
What are you fixing for supper tonight?

425
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,568
一些烩面吧
- Just some casserole.
你会做点色拉么？
- You gonna make a salad?

426
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,801
嗯
Mmm-mmm.

427
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,768
我会给你点钱
Why don't I give you a few extra dollars?

428
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,808
去打扮一下你自己
Get yourself a new dress.

429
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,605
我们会有位客人
- We're having a guest for supper.
那我们需要打扮一下么？
- Do we have to dress up?

430
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,843
你打扮起来一定很漂亮
I'm just saying you'd look real pretty in a dress.

431
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,524
那是你男盆友么？
Was it your boyfriend on the phone?

432
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,801
啥意思？
What do you mean?

433
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,086
那是你男盆友么？
That wasn't your boyfriend?

434
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,606
傻瓜，我结婚啦
- I'm married, silly.
我不会告诉老爸的
- I won't tell Daddy.

435
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,681
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

436
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,808
那是Jenny，我高中的朋友
That was Jenny, an old friend from high school.

437
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,564
拿着
Here you go.

438
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,642
我说过了，不要黑橄榄
I said no black Olives.

439
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,242
再做一个超霸，不要黑橄榄，我得休息一下
Fire up another supreme. No black olives. I'm taking my break.

440
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,370
吃吧
- Eat.
他帅么
- Is he cute?

441
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,329
别再谈这个了
Stop talking like that.

442
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,368
又应该找个帅锅
You should have a cute boyfriend.

443
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,247
三年级的时候有一个
I had a boyfriend in the third grade.

444
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,163
我从没告诉任何人
I never told nobody.

445
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,527
他叫马歇尔，很胖
His name was Marshall. He was fat.

446
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,886
他爱我
He loved me.

447
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,200
你需要经常出来走走
You need to go out more often.

448
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,442
没人知道我们在一起了
Nobody ever knew we were going together.

449
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,002
在休息区我们也分开走，吃午饭也不坐在一起
We didn't see each other at recess, we didn't sit together at lunch.

450
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,845
我们也不传纸条，他也从不送我回家
We never wrote notes and he didn't walk me home from school.

451
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,684
那你们在哪里见面啊
When would you see him?

452
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,921
学校上课的时候
In class, at school.

453
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,081
我是说，私下里见面
I mean, alone.

454
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,764
我们没私下见面过
We didn't see each other alone.

455
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,571
从来都没有？
- Ever?
那会暴露的
- That would have spoiled the secret.

456
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,081
那你怎么确定你们在一起了？
How'd you know you were going together,

457
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,049
假如你们从来不私下做点什么？
if you never spent any time alone?

458
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,566
我们很明白
We just knew. If we talked about it,

459
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,688
一旦我们谈起那回事，最纯真的东西就会变味道
it wouldn't have been what it was, which was true

460
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,761
神马纯真的东东？
What was true?

461
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,925
爱 我们之间的爱
Love. We loved each other.

462
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,725
你怎么能知道他爱你呢？如果互相都不交谈
How do you know he loved you, if y'all never talked about it?

463
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,450
因为那是最纯洁的爱
Because he loved me with pure love.

464
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,206
好吧
Well,

465
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,451
我猜，不会再有了
not many like that around, I guess.

466
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,806
是Joe？Joe来过了
It's Joe, isn't it? Joe's coming over.

467
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,046
Joe 谁
Joe who?

468
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,804
不记得了
I don't remember.

469
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,565
他眼神很毒
His eyes hurt.

470
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,687
唔？
Huh?

471
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,966
啥？
What?

472
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,123
见过他？
- Met him?
唔。。。
- Mmm-hmm.

473
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,051
他长啥样？
What's he like?

474
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,248
他告诉我，我应该找个功夫老师
He told me I should get a teacher for my kung fu.

475
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,885
是吗？
Yeah?

476
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,724
而且他还喝了我做的咔灰
And he had me make him some coffee.

477
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,928
他人怎么样
- What's he like?
我不清楚
- I don't know.

478
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,001
Hey, Ansel.

479
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,686
记得忘掉Jenny，她只是高中的一个老朋友
Now you just forget about Jenny She's an old friend

480
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,000
我可不想你爸知道
and I don't need any trouble from your daddy

481
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,161
只是老朋友，记得了吧
over an old friend, you hear?

482
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,930
你应该找个帅哥
- You should have a cute boyfriend.
- Shh!

483
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,802
嘿，你们在谈我么？
Hey, y'all talking about me?

484
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,850
你个耳背的老家伙
- Your ears must've been burning.
真没有
- No, sir.

485
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,402
我只是告诉Dottie她打扮起来一定很好看
I was just telling Dottie here how pretty she'd look in a new dress.

486
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,608
是啊，待会我可以带你去Thrifty
Yeah, I'll ride you over to the Thrifty

487
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,206
然后漂漂亮亮的把你接回来。
and maybe we'll pick you out something pretty, all right?

488
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,850
所有事的办妥了么？
Is everyone getting dressed up?

489
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,400
是啊，都搞定了
Yeah, we're all getting dressed up.

490
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,165
嘿，能给点钱我么？啤酒喝光了
Hey, can I get some money? We're out of beer.

491
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,288
我钱包在楼下
My purse is downstairs.

492
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,571
你什么时候告诉这倒霉孩子，这事就Joe和她？
When are you gonna tell that girl it's just gonna be her and Joe?

493
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,007
她自己会明白的
- She'll figure it out
你要去告诉她
- You gotta tell her.

494
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,281
这倒霉孩子与众不同
That girl's not like other people.

495
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,124
俄滴神，这孩子少根筋
God damn it, she don't put two and two together

496
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,565
她不明白会发生什么
like you, me and Chris.

497
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,285
你担心个毛线
What are you so worried about?

498
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,761
他甚至都没约会过
She never been on a date before.

499
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,884
那不是约会
- It ain't a date.
是啊，龌龊的私密
- It's the closest thing

500
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,121
这辈子也不会再有了
she'll ever come to one.

501
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,851
除了单恋一个永远不知情的胖子
Except for some fat kid that didn't even know it.

502
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,001
虾米胖子？
What fat kid?

503
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,241
你要告诉她
You talk to that girl

504
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,482
你有责任安排好所有事
else you're liable to blow this whole thing real good.

505
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,444
我该说点啥？
- What am I supposed to say?
告诉她整个故事
- Tell her the story, for God's sake.

506
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,562
为神马你要把整件事搞得更加复杂呢？
Why do you have to make everything so difficult?

507
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,768
神马故事
- What story?
当前的状况
- The situation.

508
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,444
告诉她为神马Joe今晚会来
Tell her why Joe is coming over tonight.

509
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,723
为什么我要那样做
- How am I supposed to get to that?
假如她不知道
- If she don't know

510
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,003
她会把事情搞砸的
what's expected of her, she might disappoint him.

511
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,844
把她送到Thrifty，是吧
I'm riding her over to the Thrifty, ain't I?

512
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,408
Ugh!

513
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,930
那我的酒钱呢？ Sharla
What about my beer money? ...Sharla.

514
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,247
胖子？
What fat kid?

515
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,931
希望你带上你的长矛了
Hope you have a spare.

516
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,240
老爸
Daddy?

517
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,486
老爸
Daddy.

518
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,683
嘿，嘿，看呐
Hey, hey, look at you.

519
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,681
你看起来像个电影明星
You look like a goddamn movie star.

520
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,361
转个身
Turn around.

521
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,280
转个身
Turn around.

522
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,084
看起来真的像电影明星
Yeah, just like a goddamn movie star.

523
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,930
我觉得很可笑
I feel funny.

524
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,091
哦，别介，你看起来很漂亮
Oh, don't say that, You look beautiful.

525
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,204
我的屁股太肥了
My butt's too big.

526
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,409
让我告诉你些大屁股铝淫的小秘密
Well, let me let you in on a little secret.

527
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,251
那些大屁股
- Guys like big butts
哪有
- They do not.

528
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,849
都是真的
I'm speaking from experience.

529
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,888
Sharla没有大屁股
Sharla doesn't have a big butt.

530
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,486
是啊，她会有的
Yeah, well, give her some time.

531
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,051
你肿么还不换衣服
Why aren't you dressed yet?

532
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,891
我不会假如你们的晚餐的
'Cause I'm not gonna stay for supper.

533
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,244
啥意思？
What do you mean?

534
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,322
你哥和我有些事要做
Chris and I got some business to attend to

535
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,401
我哥在哪？
Where's Chris?

536
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,529
所以，就你和Joe留下来吃晚饭
So it's just gonna be you and Joe for supper.

537
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,008
那我要换回来
- I should change.
不，不
- No. No.

538
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,766
不用，亲爱的
- No. honey.
不，我要换掉
- Yeah, I should.

539
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:59,728
Dottie，Joe假如看到你这么漂亮，会比较好
Dottie, I think it'd be nice for Joe, if he saw you looking pretty.

540
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,121
不，我要去换。。。
- Yeah, I'm going to...
听着，亲爱的
- Listen, honey. Dottie!

541
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,767
蛋定，Dottie
- Just settle down. Dottie!
让我换掉吧
- Let go of me, I have to change!

542
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,091
等等
- Dottie, wait a second!
换掉！我一定要换掉！
- Change! I have to change!

543
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,446
我一定得换掉
I have to change!

544
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,205
Dottie 别关门
Dottie' don't close that fucking door on me.

545
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,282
我一定得换掉
I have to change!

546
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,964
该死的
God damn it!

547
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,287
等等，你个倒霉的孩子
Hold still, you little bitch.

548
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,127
发生了什么
- What the hell's going on in here?
咋咧
- What the fuck!

549
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,202
发生了神马事？
What the hell's going on?

550
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,370
她一定要换掉她身上的裙子
- She wants to take off her dress.
然后？
- So?

551
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,044
你不觉得她穿裙子会更漂亮一点么？
Well, don't you think she looks nice?

552
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,043
让她换呗，你随便穿上点什么
Let her change, if she wants. You put on whatever you like.

553
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,807
你不觉得她很漂亮么？
- Don't you think she looks nice?
嘿，别管他了，老爸
- Hey, let her change, Dad!

554
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,086
让她换
Let her change!

555
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,322
等等
- Hang on a goddamn second.
- Hey

556
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,165
让她换
Let her change....Change.

557
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,686
你们为什么还在这？
What are you doing here?

558
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,569
我们正要出去
We're on our way out.

559
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,211
我们已经谈过了
- We discussed this.
别猴急，我们在走
- Well, don't push it. We're leaving.

560
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,124
是的，别性急
That's right, junior. Don't push it.

561
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,011
现在，我们可以开始后面的事了
Now, we make arrangements,

562
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,448
我希望看到你们认真的去找到一些有用信息
I expect the details to have some attention paid to them.

563
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,090
我们走，老爸
Let's go, Dad.

564
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,170
明白了吗？
You understand?

565
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,401
Yeah.

566
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,771
好孩子
Good boy.

567
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,851
她在哪？
Where is she?

568
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,604
换衣服
She's changing.

569
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,686
他要是遇上Sharla就好了
Too bad he didn't meet Sharla first.

570
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,570
他要看不上，我也不会很在意
He could've dated her, I wouldn't have minded so much.

571
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,564
那是我老婆，你个倒霉孩子
That's my wife you're talking about, fuck head.

572
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,290
你对
Yeah. Right.

573
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,286
Dottie?

574
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,564
是我
It's me, Joe Cooper.

575
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,486
你哥他们走了
We're alone now.

576
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,321
你不出来也行
You don't wanna come out, it's okay.

577
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,006
你可以呆在里面
You stay in there as long as you like.

578
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,163
烩面闻起来不错
Casserole smells nice.

579
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,405
我希望能找到一个你感兴趣的约会故事
I wish I had a funny story about first dates

580
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,767
但我没有
or casseroles, but I don't.

581
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,882
或许我会有一个
Maybe one will come to me.

582
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,491
或许没有
Maybe not.

583
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,162
Lee Hazlewood. Okie from Muskogee.

584
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,330
我也不认识什么Lee Hazlewood
I don't have a funny story about Lee Hazlewood, either.

585
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,811
或者什么奥克拉河马的故事
Or Oklahoma.

586
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,686
倒是有些奥克拉河马的趣事
I guess Oklahoma's kind of funny anyway though.

587
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,248
哥是从遥望着奥克拉河马的
I grew up, looking at Oklahoma.

588
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,081
红河南岸长大的
From the south bank of the Red River.

589
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:29,570
小的时候记得
When I was a boy, the border between Texas

590
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,042
德克萨斯和奥克拉河马的分界实际就是河的中间
and Oklahoma was actually the middle of the river.

591
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,203
在北岸钓鱼，鱼就是奥克拉河马的
You fish the north bank, you caught Okie fish.

592
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,049
我是在德州钓鱼的
I caught Texas fish.

593
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,410
在某一个时候，德州放弃了这边的半个河岸
Sometime since then, we gave our half of the river away.

594
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,650
现在，整条河都属于奥克拉河马了
Now the whole damn thing belongs to Oklahoma.

595
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,925
南岸
South bank.

596
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,088
现在成为边界了
That's the border now.

597
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,967
哥不明白为什么这样做
I'm not sure why we did that.

598
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,404
那些事让我很郁闷
But it makes me mad.

599
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,722
听起来很像放弃了
Ifs kind of like giving away

600
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,850
你家门前的走廊
your front porch.

601
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,841
你还好吗？
- How are you?
很好
- Fine.

602
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,605
你不想知道我怎么样了？
You wanna know how I am?

603
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,445
你好妈？
How are you?

604
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,607
我很好
I'm fine. Thank you.

605
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,684
你看起来真漂亮
You look nice.

606
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,927
谢谢
Thank you.

607
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,764
我换过衣服了
I changed.

608
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,242
我不知道只有你和我一起吃晚饭
I didn't know it was just gonna be you and me for dinner

609
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,527
他们应该告诉你的
Someone should have told you.

610
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,804
他们刚告诉我
They did Just now.

611
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,009
你刚才换了什么？
What did you change from?

612
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,360
一条裙子
A dress.

613
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,324
那应该很漂亮
I'd love to see it.

614
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,170
你眼神很毒
Your eyes hurt.

615
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,770
请你原谅
I beg your pardon?

616
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,400
Dottie，你相信我吗？
Dottie, do you trust me?

617
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,845
不
Not quite.

618
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,726
好的
Good.

619
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,920
很可爱
Lovely.

620
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,045
我还是处铝
I'm a virgin.

621
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,041
哥知道
I know.

622
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,646
Ay!

623
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,886
三文鱼烩面
- Tuna casserole.
是啊
- Yes.

624
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,362
能开动了吗
- May I serve?
- Please.

625
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,091
谢谢
Thank you.

626
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,246
Mmm.

627
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,649
哥还是想看看那套裙子
I'd really like to see that dress.

628
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,404
那个不好看
It wasn't right.

629
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,244
能看看么
May I see it anyway?

630
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,364
你准备怎么干掉我妈？
How you gonna kill my momma?

631
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,322
这个不适合晚餐的时候谈，是吧
That's not appropriate dinner conversation, Dottie.

632
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,485
至少你可以下药
Unless you poison her.

633
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,930
你会被委任去调查这案件么?
Will you be the detective who investigates?

634
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,331
不会
Probably not.

635
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,765
也可能是
Sometimes.

636
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,009
那是个问题么
Is that a problem?

637
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,244
那会是个机会（一语双关-很舒适）
That's convenience.

638
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,804
就当是你家吧
So are homes.

639
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,486
Yes.

640
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,324
我喜欢我哥
I love my brother.

641
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,922
记得老爸老妈离婚的时候
I remember when Momma and Daddy were getting a divorce.

642
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,441
她仅仅告诉我们，她当时喝醉了
She just told us. She was drunk.

643
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,489
她说 我不再爱你们的父亲了
She said, "I don't love your daddy no more".

644
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,884
我也从未爱过他
"I never loved him."

645
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,331
我尖叫这也起不了任何作用
And I screamed something that didn't make any sense.

646
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,971
于是我跑到前面的院子里
Ran out of the house to the front yard.

647
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,610
我哥也出来了，没说话
Chris came out. He hadn't said anything.

648
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:42,924
他只是面对面的把我压在下面，像这样
He just laid on top of me. He stretched his body out like this.

649
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,361
把我压住知道我停止哭泣
Laid on top of me till I stopped crying.

650
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,521
- Dottie...

651
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,443
我们从未提起过
We never talked about it ever.

652
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,730
穿上那裙子
Bring the dress.

653
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,484
现在？
- Now?
是啊
- Yes.

654
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,689
为什你不能为我穿上它呢？
Why wouldn't you wear that for me?

655
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,490
那不是我
'Cause it's not me.

656
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,282
这个没半毛钱关系
Not when you're not in it.

657
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,205
我曾有个男盆友
- I once had a boyfriend.
穿上它
- Put it on.

658
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,725
好吧
Alright.

659
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,207
你去哪？
Where are you going?

660
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,170
我去换裙子
- I was going to put on the dress.
我说穿上它
- I said put it on.

661
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,921
我是要去啊
I was.

662
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,561
在这
Here.

663
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,608
我想看看
I wanna see you put it on.

664
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,440
停
Stop.

665
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,684
把袜子脱了
Take off your socks.

666
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,323
脱掉你的胸罩
Take off your brassiere.

667
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,971
脱掉你的内裤
Take off your underwear.

668
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,486
造小孩？
Babies?

669
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,964
穿上裙子
Put on the dress.

670
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,411
过来
Come here.

671
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,410
到我后面来
Right behind me.

672
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,287
把手放进我的裤裆里
Put your hand inside my pants.

673
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,890
你摸到了吗
Do you feel that?

674
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,727
是啊
Yes.

675
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,563
神马感脚？
What's that feel like?

676
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,489
不记得
I don't remember.

677
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,004
你多大了？
How old are you now?

678
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,241
12.

679
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,245
我也是
So am I.

680
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,449
换我来
Switch places with me.

681
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,450
你的男盆友？
Your boyfriend?

682
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,611
马歇尔
- Marshall.
- Marshall.

683
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,205
他很胖
He was fat.

684
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,851
Uh-huh.

685
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,322
他在精神上爱我
He loved me with pure love.

686
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,844
这是我们的秘密
It was our secret.

687
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,486
没人知道
Nobody.

688
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,330
Oh.

689
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,645

And it's Mango, Cliff, Rick's Café

693
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,889
很远之外是Bella Luna
and way, way back there, Bella Luna.

694
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,606
不到半英里了，他们进入大弯道
Less than half a mile to go as they move into the far turn.

695

Betty Boo在外侧领先于Nose，
Betty Boo leads a nose on the outside. Yes I Can...

696
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,882
现在看来也仅仅是小小的领先
It's still Tilt a Whirl with a tenuous lead.

697
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,803
Legal Tender and Endearing Manners

698
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,120
继续超前，在外道的是8号

702

- Piece of shit.

704
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,650
Endearing Manner上来了
...but it's Endearing Manner that's come on now

705
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,121
领先啦
- to take the lead as they come...
它被挡在了身后
- He held back!

706
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,686
进入冲刺了
- And in a spectacular finish...
它被挡在身后
- He held back!

707
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,651
一次完美的加速，Endering Mannaer 赢得了胜利
A spectacular upset, Endearing Manner has won the impossible!

708
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,724
孤星17比1的冷门得到了证实
17 to 1, resolved at Lone Star here today.

709
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,040

God damn, motherfuck!

710
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,920
- Hey.
时间到了，兄弟
- Time's up brother.

711
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,085
三周前你就要求一周的延长了
You asked for an extra week three weeks ago brother.

712
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,245
你曾说过你有个计划
- You told me you had a plan
不，听着，我打过你电话
- No, listen, I called you.

713
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,288
11点我打过你电话
- I called you at 11:00
这是你所谓的计划么？
- This the plan?

714
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,646
别这样，G 哥
Come on, G-Man.

715
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:19,242
是啊，钱会在。。。
Yeah, the money is coming to you by about, Motherfucking...

716
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,285
杂种
Son of a bitch!

717
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,444
倒霉孩子
You little motherfucker!

718
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,010
你去哪里
Where you going?

719
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,005
该死
Piece of shit!

720
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,362
瞧瞧这个！
Here you go, here you go!

721
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,241
Chris.

722
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:20,926
Hi Digger.

723
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,131
最近如何，孩子
How you been, boy?

724
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,130
还好，你呢？
Pretty good. How about yourself?

725
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,487
挺好
Oh, fair to middling.

726
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,925
血压很高
Blood pressure.

727
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:34,881
看过医生？
You taking medicine?

728
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,042
是啊，不能吃咸的，别有压力
Yeah, alt that. No salt, low stress.

729
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:41,246
当然，Amy还是在做炸鸡，你知道我没法抗拒的
Course, Amy keeps making that fried chicken. You know I can't resist it.

730
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,730
Amy还好么？
How is Amy?

731
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,929
她破产啦
Well, she's all busted up right at the moment.

732
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,641
你还记得Dumpling，那个老家伙
You remember Dumpling, that old bluetick we had?

733
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,126
是啊，记得
Yeah, sure, Dumpling.

734
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,971
好吧，听着我们昨个早上让他下课了
Yeah, well, we had to put him to sleep yesterday morning

735
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,764
- Oh, no.
- Yup.

736
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,126
真遗憾你错过了一个Party
Well, you missed yourself a hell of a party

737
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,201
几周前
a couple of weeks ago.

738
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,486
对不起，我错过了你的生日
Sorry I missed your birthday.

739
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,409
实话，我很高兴你没来
Well, I'm glad you missed my birthday.

740
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,000
我只是希望你来参加我们的Party
I just wish you hadn't missed the party.

741
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,401
G哥，我们当时有多少人？
How many people we have out there at the place, G-Man?

742
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,481
百十来好
A couple hundred.

743
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,523
没多少啊
Oh, hell, it wasn't that many.

744
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,608
150总是有的
- 150 anyway.
- No shit.

745
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,171
很遗憾我错过了
Sorry l missed it.

746
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,284
是啊，很不错的聚会，很多烧烤
Yeah, good old party. Lots of barbeque.

747
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,841
嘿，G哥当时还表演了手风琴
Hey, G-Man here, he played the accordion.

748
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,531
那就对了
That's right.

749
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,841
嘿，那个铝的当时在场么？
- Hey, wasn't that gal out there?
哪一个？
- What gal?

750
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,446
那个总围着Chris转的铝孩
Well, the one that's always sniffing around Chris's shit here.

751
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,161
叫啥？
What the hell's her name?

752
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,163
有个很大厨房的那个铝的。。。
The one with the great big caboose on her...

753
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,884
- Arlene?
- Arlene.

754
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,644
是啊，Arlene
Yeah, Arlene.

755
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:37,204
你最好找找她，她很适合你
You'd better look out for her, boy. She may be too much woman for you.

756
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,521
她最好离烧烤远点
Well, she'd better stay away from the barbeque

757
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,608
要不然她会太女人了以致出不了那扇门（暗指很肥）
or she'd be too much woman to fit through the door.

758
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,568
嘿，太逗了
Damn, you make me laugh.

759
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,849
听着，我是来说服这个倒霉孩子别找你麻烦
Hey, listen, I'm just gonna have the boys here kick the shit out of you.

760
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,207
你最好这几天就把钱还给我
You'd better pay me my money in a couple of days

761
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,526
要不我会把你用胶布缠起来
or I'm gonna wrap you up in electrician tape

762
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:58,082
然后把你活埋了，你的明白？
and bury you in a coffin about 10 feet deep. Huh?

763
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,321
我会转告Amy你的问候
I'll tell Amy you asked about her.

764
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,731
那至少会让她开心
That'll make her smile.

765
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,207
他真心喜欢你
He really likes you.

766
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,483
趴着别动
- Stay the hell down!
对不起
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

767
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,289
慢点慢点
- Easy, Easy.
俄滴神啊，发生了什么
- Oh, my God, what happened?

768
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:06,002
该死的
- Fuck!
Chris，你看起来很差劲
- Chris! Shit. You look rough, boy.

769
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,241
老家伙抓到你了
Them old boys caught up to you huh.

770
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:10,483
爸！我想他们打断了我的手
Dad! I think they broke my hand!

771
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,925
你的脸肿么了
- What did they do to your face?
对不起
- Excuse me.

772
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,764
要送你去医院么？
- You want to go to the hospital?
我想最好送他去
- I think he does.

773
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:17,049
哥被群殴了
- I got beat up.
你咋滴咧？  - 哥被群殴了
- What happened to you? - I got beat up!

774
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,207
那点湿布来
Can we get a wet rag?

775
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,890
他们怎么你了？
They put the fucking boot to you, or what?

776
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,561
是那个Digger Soames？
That son of a bitch Digger Soames?

777
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,648
他们报了你的菊？
They do all they were going to?

778
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,404
他们要想杀他，他早死了
If they wanted to kill him, he'd be dead.

779
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,289
你鼻子破了
- Your nose is broken.
不止这个
- Is that all?

780
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,891
他们说了什么？
What'd they say to you?

781
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:33,123
你认为他们会说什么？
What the fuck do you think they said?

782
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,601
我估计他们想要回他们的钱
- I reckon they want their money.
该死
- No shit!

783
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:36,681
要啤酒么？
Hey, you want a beer?

784
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,171
他们在哪里找到你的？
Where'd they find you?

785
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,129
国王妓院
Fucking Sport of Kings.

786
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,281
你见到Bill了吗？
Did you see Bill there?

787
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,489
我不知道，为啥？
I don't know, why?

788
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,891
他欠我10块
He owes me 10 bucks.

789
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,446
我要睡了，来吧Ansel
I'm going to bed. Come on Ansel.

790
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:48,561
我们必须去医院
We have to go to the hospital.

791
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,688
不，他没事，仅仅是被揍了一顿
No' he's fine. He just got a whupping.

792
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,649
Ansel！来吧
- Ansel! Come on!
好吧
- All right, then.

793
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,848
我想我要回房了
I guess we're gonna turn in.

794
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,409
Dottie，我们走
Dottie, go on.

795
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,849
晚安Chris
Good night Chris.

796
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:45,328
我想知道我们现在进展怎样了
I want to know what kind of progress you're making.

797
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,124
正在进行中
It's being taken care of.

798
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,247
好吧
Yeah, right.

799
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,521
你狗日的上了我妹
You've been fucking my sister

800
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,881
我母亲仍然更健康的活着
and my mother's a hell of a lot healthier than me at the moment.

801
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:56,644
你是想我退出么？讲一声就行
Do you want me off the job? Say the word.

802
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,490
你计划多久行动？
When are you planning on doing it?

803
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,440
今晚
Tonight.

804
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,366
真的？
Really?

805
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,168
然后你明天就离开了？
So you'd be leaving tomorrow then?

806
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:10,403
不不不，好处费仅仅是抵消后付款的
No, no, no, the retainer's for the money.

807
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,726
我要等到拿到钱再走
I'm not leaving until I get my money.

808
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,081
我可不喜欢这个
I don't like that.

809
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,207
我可不在乎
Well, I don't care.

810
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,328
我不想你接近我妹
I don't want you near my sister.

811
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,249
我不在乎
I don't care.

812
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,001
加入我告诉你交易取消？
And if I tell you the deal's off?

813
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:28,167
我会立刻离开，你也永远看不到我
Then I'll leave right now and you'll never see me again.

814
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:30,971
你的决定
Your call.

815
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,202
你欠谁的钱？
Who you into for this money?

816
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,530
我不会说
I won't tell you.

817
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,165
Digger Soames?

818
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,850
你怎么知道？
How'd you know that?

819
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,922
加入你不还给他，他会怎么对付你来着？
What did he say he'd do to you, if you don't pay him?

820
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,331
你也知道的
You know that too?

821
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,085
他会动手的
He'll do it.

822
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,290
你会拘捕承诺杀人的人么？
Aren't you supposed to arrest people who commit murder?

823
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,730
我喜欢Digger
I like Digger.

824
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,561
去抓他
Do it.

825
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,366
- Mr Tim.
- Hey Joe.

826
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:20,291
Joe, Joe. Thank God.

827
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:23,846
我还担心我不能到达这里，我来的太晚了
I was afraid I wouldn't get here. I'd be too late, Thank God.

828
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,571
听着，我们得停止这一切。
Listen, we got to stop this. Alright?

829
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,165
我已经有很多麻烦了
I've been in a lot of trouble all my life,

830
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:30,089
但是我从没放弃过
but I never did nothing like this before.

831
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:33,004
对不起了，我可不想浪费你的时间
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to waste your time.

832
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,890
我是说，我恨她，我一直都恨她
I mean, I hate that bitch. I always hated her.

833
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,401
我可不能上我妹，你明白的
I just can't be the one, you know?

834
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,847
但是真正的问题还是Dottie
But the main thing really is Dottie.

835
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:44,083
我妹可从来没做过白给的事，你也明白的
You know, my sister never did nothing to nobody.

836
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,571
- (CAR LOCK BEEPS}
你要说服她放弃
- You got to give her up,

837
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,130
我可不想再见到她了
'cause I can't look her in the eyes otherwise.

838
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,931
我是说你可不能拥有她，不能
I mean, you can't have her. I can't let you have her.

839
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,765
你要做什么？去哪里？
What are you doing? Where are you going?

840
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,286
上车
Hop in.

841
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,409
该死
Shit. OW!

842
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,201
Fuck!

843
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,684
我曾有个农场，那也是我梦想生活的样子
I started a farm once. It seemed like the life I wanted.

844
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,282
为我自己忙碌着，吸吸大麻悠闲地在农村生活。
Work for myself outside a lot. Live in the country, smoke dope.

845
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:16,285
看看电视，这一切都是我的梦想，所以我开了个养兔的农场
Watch TV. That's all I really want. So I started a rabbit farm.

846
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,771
我靠自己的双手搭建了农场
I built it with my own two hands.

847
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:21,322
装卸站，围栏，水塔，排管，以及兔子
Lumber, chicken wire, water bottles, pellets, rabbits.

848
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,970
我喜欢那些可爱的小家伙
I loved those little bastards.

849
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,769
他们总是微笑着嘿休嘿休一整天
They smell like shit and they fuck all the time,

850
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,604
但是太容易招引野兽了
but they're awful easy going animals.

851
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,524
老鼠，臭鼬或者其他的都很容易进来
A rat, a skunk or something got into the pen

852
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,364
那是些鲜活的兔子
and it was rabid and awful hot out too.

853
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,204
于是他们撕开了每一只兔子
And they just tore each other up.

854
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,443
眼球满地乱滚，口中一面尖叫着一面吐着血泡
Their eyes rolling and foaming at the mouth and screaming.

855
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:39,922
你听过兔子的尖叫么？像极了小铝孩
You know rabbits scream? They sound just like little girls.

856
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,122
那完全被打乱了
I mean, it was disturbing.

857
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,962
我开始贩卖毒品，我很了解这个。。。
I started selling dope for a living. I knew more about it, so...

858
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:48,611
我没钱还给他们，也不想还给他们
So I can't pay this guy and I don't even really want to.

859
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,970
你必须离开， Joe
You gotta get out Joe.

860
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,725
你必须永远的离开我妹
You gotta leave my sister alone forever.

861
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,090
这都肿么了
What's going on?

862
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:32,761
Jesus.

863
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:46,846
慢点
Easy.

864
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:00,690
把她的脚放在地板上
- Put her feet on the floorboard.
- Alright.

865
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,724
好了吗？
- Alright?
好了
- Yeah.

866
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,721
把这个放回行李箱去
Put that in the trunk and shut it.

867
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,889
来点光
Give me some light.

868
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:20,488
我正在看电视，Chris
- I was watching that, Chris.
听着
- Listen.

869
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,091
我正在看电视
- I was watching a show.
我知道
- I know.

870
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,686
我想看看结局
- I wanted to see how it turned out!
他没完成那任务，明白吗？
- He don't catch the bird, okay?

871
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:28,207
他会没完没了的继续
- It just goes on and on and on.
那又尊样？
- Yeah?

872
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,165
听着，亲爱的
Listen, honey.

873
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:41,446
我知道，你清楚下面要发生什么
I know, you know what's going on, okay?

874
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:44,447
我没有机会亲自解释你听
I don't got to explain it to you.

875
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,681
唔
Mmm-hmm.

876
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,691
假如我能明白爱因斯坦的相对论
If I'd known how this would all fall out

877
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,051
我一定会选择另一条路
I might have done things different.

878
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:54,121
不
No.

879
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:13,810
出什么问题了
What's wrong?

880
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,325
俄滴神啊
For God's sake.

881
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,286
该死
Shit.

882
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,601
各位早安
- Good Morning y'all.
早安
- Good morning.

883
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,000
早安
Morning.

884
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,124
她的中间姓氏， Ansel？
What was her maiden name, Ansel?

885
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,203
我需要填进表格里
I need it for the file.

886
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:46,088
好的，Rogers
Yes, sir. Rogers.

887
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,367
Adele Carolyn Rogers.

888
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,450
这个需要预审么？
- Is there gonna be a trial?
不
- No. No.

889
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:06,643
Joe知道他应该做什么
- Joe knows what he's doing.
我可总来没被审讯过
- I ain't never been to a trial.

890
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:08,842
你在报纸上见过枪击案么？或亲眼看到在她车里发生
Did you see the shot in the paper? Her car?

891
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:11,287
Joe知道要做什么，他们不会进行尸检的
Joe knows what he's doing' all right? They couldn't do no autopsy,

892
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:14,204
因为并没有什么值得特别调查的
'cause there wasn't much left to speak of.

893
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,008
进展怎么样了？
- How'd it go?
让我们先离开这里
- Let's just get out of here.

894
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:21,483
小杂种
- Little son of a bitch.
嘛事？
- What's the matter?

895
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,202
我不想当着Dottie说
I am not talking in front of Dottie.

896
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,890
她早就知道了
She knows what's going on.

897
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,401
我不想当着Dottie说
- I'm not talking in front of her.
刚才发生了什么？
- What happened with Filpatrick?

898
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:30,764
我TM不想当着Dottie说
I ain't talking in front of Dottie!

899
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,764
他们不会给你那笔钱的，是吗？
They're not gonna pay you the money, are they? 

900
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,968
老爸？
- Dad?
Ansel，蛋定
- Ansel, calm down.

901
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:39,170
老爸
- Dad?
Ansel！别说话！
- Ansel! Don't make a scene!

902
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,562
谁告诉你，你妈有什么保险？
Who told you about Adele's policy?

903
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,881
Rex！Rex说的
Rex! Rex told me.

904
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,850
他在有次谈话的时候提起来的，你能不能。。。。
He just mentioned it in conversation. Will you, for the love of God...

905
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,001
多久？
When?

906
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:53,447
一次谈话
- In conversation.
多久？
- Not how, when?

907
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:56,725
几个星期前，我和老妈刚吵了架
A few weeks ago. Me and Mom just had a big fight...

908
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,564
哦，天呐
- Oh, Christ.
我说过，Ansel
- I told you, Ansel.

909
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:00,091
咋咧？
- What happened?
我就知道
- I told you from the start.

910
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:02,162
闭嘴！  -  别叫我闭嘴！
- Shut up! - Don't tell me to shut up!

911
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,083
又不是我挑起整件事情的
- I'm not the one who blew this thing.
出了啥事了啊？
- What happened, Dad?

912
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,242
你到我家来，告诉每个人该干什么
You show up at our place, tell everyone what to do.

913
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:08,249
我们如何去挣那几千块！
How we're all gonna see a hundred grand!

914
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,481
该死的，快告诉我发生了什么
God damn it, you tell me right now.

915
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:12,450
Dottie不是最终受益人
Dottie is not the beneficiary!

916
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,771
Rex是最终受益人  - 我不明白
- Rex is the beneficiary!  - I don't understand.

917
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,651
那还不算什么  --给我再解释解释
- It's not real tough. - Explain it to me.

918
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:21,161
Dottie得不到那笔钱
Dottie does not get the money.

919
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,569
Rex会得到那笔钱。  - 蛋定，蛋定
- Rex gets the money. - Wait.

920
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:29,283
Dottie得不到那50000，倒霉的孩子！
Dottie does not get $50,000 boy!

921
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,967
Rex! Rex!

922
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:36,371
Rex会得到那50000块
Rex gets the $50,000.

923
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:39,404
- That's not right.
- That's the way it is! That can't be.

924
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:42,570
你自己去问Filpatrick！ - 我被告知！
- Go talk to Filpatrick yourself! - I was told!

925
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,880
他告诉我的！
Because he told me!

926
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,962
Rex告诉我的，他说的！
Rex told me, he told me!

927
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,248
Rex是老妈的男盆友
Rex was Momma's boyfriend.

928
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:52,926
闭嘴Dottie，他明明是这样说的！
Just shut up Dottie, He told me!

929
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,241
他说慌了！ - 为什么要这样做？ - 那还用想么？
- He was lying. - Why would he do that? - Why do you think?

930
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:58,324
不会的！他根本不知道我会这样做。
No. No, he couldn't have known I'd do this.

931
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:03,367
谁告诉你的杀手Joe
Who told you about Killer Joe?

932
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:06,846
哦
Oh.

933
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,486
哦，天呐
Oh, God.

934
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:12,328
我告诉你的。 - 是啊， 是我告诉你的么？
I told you. - Yeah. Did I tell you?

935
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,006
俄滴神啊，我被玩弄了
Oh my God, I'm fucked.

936
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:19,090
MD！MD！MD！
Piece of fucking fuck-suck-cake!

937
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,729
我不相信你
I don't believe you God.

938
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,370
你最好相信
You'd better believe it!

939
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:25,528
因为你会的，你一会儿就能明白
'Cause the sooner you believe it, the sooner you figure out a way

940
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,284
还要付杀手Joe的钱！
to pay Killer Joe his money!

941
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:30,688
我们走吧
- We gotta get going.
还别提有个Digger Soames
- Not to mention Digger Soames.

942
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,728
我们不走吗 - 为虾米？
- Gotta get going y'all. - For what?

943
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,080
葬礼在半小时后开始
Funeral's in a half hour.

944
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:38,969
你们去吧，我得好好想想
Y'all get going. I gotta think of something.

945
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,491
希望你能想明白
I wish you would.

946
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:43,325
你要想通了，我们也好过点
We're all so much better off whenever you do.

947
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,927
Joe在哪？他会回来的，是吧
Where's Joe? He's coming back, isn't he?

948
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,206
是的
Yeah.

949
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:50,807
他会回来的
- He's coming back all right.
他一定会回来的
- Yeah, he's coming back all right.

950
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,804
我们马上就要跟你妈在地下会合了
Let's hit it. We gotta get your mother in the ground

951
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,122
我带Dottie走。 - Dottie！
- I'll take Dottie. - Dottie!

952
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,169
是啊，我们自己去
Yeah, we'll be along.

953
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:04,481
Smith小姐，你见过香薰过的地狱之门么？
Ms Smith, when you're done fumigating the gates of hell.

954
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,849
嘿，Chris
Hey, Chris.

955
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,488
帮我们一个忙！
Why don't you do us all a big favour?

956
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,449
去屎！
Just go kill yourself.

957
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:30,685
你不舒服么？
Do you feel bad?

958
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,241
是啊
Yeah.

959
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,966
我感觉，仿佛是时候回火星去了
I feel like maybe I'm not supposed to be on Earth or something.

960
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:42,967
你还记得他们教你肿么方你的膝盖么？
Do you remember them shows you used to put on with your knees?

961
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,411
唔？
Huh?

962
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:49,605
我们得躺在床上，拿着手电筒，把膝盖弯曲朝上
We'd be laying in bed and you'd get a flashlight and put your knees up

963
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,489
在一边放上一副墨镜
and put a pair of sunglasses on one knee

964
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:54,006
另一边放上帽子
and some kind of hat on the other?

965
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:56,086
是啊
Yeah.

966
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,683
再接着是一段表演
Put on a little show.

967
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:02,084
最伟大的表演，我记得你是这样叫的
"Greatest Show on Earth“ is what you called it.

968
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:03,281
是么？
Yeah?

969
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:09,686
进入时间的永恒，从现在起，再没有颠沛流离
Into time and forever, from now on, no more adventures,

970
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,842
- 没有时间的终结或者国王的谢幕
time outs or king's exes.

971
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,926
在最后你会重复的念道
Everlasting one more time than you can say,

972
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,288
进入无尽的虚空，阿门
into infinity and outer space, Amen.

973
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,208
后悔是最可怕的
Nothing's worse than regret.

974
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:28,127
癌症，被鲨鱼吃掉都不可怕
Not cancer, not being eaten by a shark, nothing.

975
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,448
Joe 会回来的，是吧？ 因为。。。
Joe's coming back isn't he? 'Cause I...

976
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,931
我想离开
I'm leaving.

977
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:41,331
我在想也许 - 我想你能跟我一起走
- I think maybe... - I want you to come with me.

978
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:42,686
去哪？
Where?

979
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,006
墨西哥
Mexico.

980
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:46,649
不，更远，秘鲁
No, further. Peru.

981
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,850
在南美
In South America.

982
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,806
我们怎么去？  -  开车去
- How we gonna get there? - We'll drive.

983
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:53,846
我们能开车去
We can drive it.

984
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,400
Chris 。。。- 你不喜欢德州么？
- Chris... - Do you like Texas?

985
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:02,810
很多人都说那里很不错
These people talk about it like it's such a great place and all,

986
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:05,247
实际上就是一帮土炮，和红番
but it's really just a bunch of goddamn hicks and rednecks,

987
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,971
有一大片开阔地
with too much space to walk around in!

988
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,682
而且很温暖 - 我们走吧
- It's warm. - Let's go.

989
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:13,531
我们走吧
Let's just go.

990
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:16,441
现在 - 去葬礼
- Now. - To the funeral?

991
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:19,650
嘿，假如我们去了就回不来了
Hey, if we're gonna pull this off we gotta gas up.

992
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,290
我必须见Joe - 不，Dottie
- I have to see Joe. - No, Dottie.

993
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:22,407
我必须见他
I have to see him.

994
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:23,925
我们必须去秘鲁，现在！
We have to go to Peru now!

995
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,561
那你自己上路吧 我必须见Joe
Well, then you go by yourself. 'Cause I have to see Joe!

996
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,649
我们来做个约定
I'll make you a deal.

997
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:44,730
我们去葬礼，然后你再见Joe
We'll go to the funeral and you can see Joe after.

998
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:56,206
不开玩笑，我保证
No funny stuff, Promise.

999
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:01,691
你发誓
You swear?

1000
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:04,481
我发誓
I swear.

1001
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:08,445
你不能告诉Joe，我们会去秘鲁。
You can't tell Joe we're going to Peru, okay?

1002
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,648
你不能跟他说再见，至少别直说！
You can't tell him goodbye, not outright.

1003
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:12,565
好吧
- Okie-dokie.

1004
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,768
你也不能告诉老爸和Sharla
And you can't tell Dad or Sharla, either,

1005
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:17,321
因为他们正在气头上，一定会破坏我的计划的
'cause they're mad at me right now and might try to spoil our trip.

1006
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:19,530
明白了
- I understand.

1007
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,926
你高兴么？ 跟我走？
You excited? You wanna go?

1008
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:25,684
我一直都很兴奋
I'm always excited.

1009
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:30,122
我们能成功的，我们能甩开这一切
We can do this. We can pull this off.

1010
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:35,442
有人让我郁闷，我也会不高兴的
Not if somebody makes me mad.

1011
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:44,045
Rex甚至都没来，这个狗杂种
Rex didn't even bother to show up. Son of a bitch.

1012
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:51,331
请您俯身近来，凝听我们的声音
Bow down thy ear to me. Deliver me speedily.

1013
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:56,007
请赐予我坚固的石墙，保护我
Be thou my strong rock for a house of defence to save me.

1014
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:59,611
我将再次关荣的笼罩于您的慈悲之下
I would be glad to rejoice in thy mercy.

1015
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:01,969
您将免去我一切的烦恼
For thou has considered my trouble.

1016
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,965
拯救我的灵魂与逆境之中
Thou has known my soul in adversities.

1017
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:10,087
您将从敌人的千军万马中拯救我
And thou has not shut me up into the hand of the enemy.

1018
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:12,891
并与许我踏入主，光荣的殿堂
Thou has set my feet in the Lord's room.

1019
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,842
请宽容我，主啊！
Have mercy on me, oh, Lord.

1020
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,808
我将被世人所遗忘
I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind.

1021
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,644
我们聚集于此，乞求永恒的长眠
We are gathered here to put to eternal rest

1022
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,409
Adele Carolyn Rogers-Smith.

1023
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:31,206
两个孩子深爱的母亲（讽刺啊），克里斯托夫 和 桃乐兮
Beloved mother of two children, Christopher and Dorothy.

1024
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:34,208
以及家族所有成员和朋友们
Devoted to her family and community.

1025
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,366
嘿，Rex
Hey Rex.

1026
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,210
手放车上
Hands on the car.

1027
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,562
去你的，屁眼 - 随你便
- Fucking asshole. - Whatever.

1028
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:23,241
Dottie!

1029
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,081
是我们
It's us!

1030
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:30,931
我们在KFC吃了饭，你饿了吗？
We stopped by the K-Fry-C. You hungry?

1031
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:35,840
Dottie!

1032
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:37,447
Chris!

1033
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,364
嘿，递我一瓶啤酒  -  他不在家里
- Hey. Fetch me a beer, would you? - He's not here.

1034
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:44,570
嘿，Joe  - Dottie在么？
- Hey Joe. - Dottie here?

1035
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,450
她睡了
She's asleep.

1036
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,202
Chris在哪？  -  我不知道
- Where's Chris? - I don't know.

1037
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,328
你来点炸鸡？我们吃的KFC
Do you want some chicken? We stopped by the K-Fry-C.

1038
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,004
当然，谢谢
Yes, please.

1039
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:55,924
自己动手，在炉子上
Sure, help yourself. It's right here on the stove.

1040
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,604
递给他一下好吗 ？
Fetch it for him, would you, hon?

1041
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:59,444
当然，嫩的还是老点的？
Sure, white or dark?

1042
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:01,527
腿
Leg.

1043
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,570
啤酒？
You want a beer?

1044
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:05,005
好的
Yes, please.

1045
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:08,803
把那架在桌上
Set that on the table, please?

1046
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,884
谢啦  - 唔
- Thank you. - Mmm-hmm.

1047
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,245
葬礼总是让人觉得饿
Funerals make people hungry for some reason.

1048
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:22,441
唔
Huh.

1049
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:24,010
我快饿死了
I'm starving.

1050
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,080
嗯
Mmm.

1051
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:35,288
你听说过保险？  -  Sharla
- You hear about the insurance? - Sharla.

1052
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:38,170
是啊，听过  - 我不知道怎么说
- Yes, I did. - I don't know what to say.

1053
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:40,242
你不需要说什么，我知道那不是你的错
You don't have to say anything. It's not your fault.

1054
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,482
是啊，但是。。。 - Chris
- Yeah, but - Chris.

1055
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:45,689
Chris是个脑残，我必须告诉你，这家伙把事情搞砸了
That Chris is so stupid, I could have told you he'd fuck this up.

1056
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,762
你难道没有么？  - 我什么？
- Why didn't you? - Why didn't I?

1057
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,207
那只是发泄，真的
It's just an expression, really.

1058
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:52,847
神马？
What is?

1059
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:56,760
她想说， Chris是个脑残，这家伙把事情搞砸了
What she said. That she could have told you Chris would fuck it up.

1060
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:58,763
我可从没听过这种抱怨
I've never heard of that expression.

1061
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:02,128
一种很礼貌的说法
- A manner of speaking, really.
我可从没喜欢过那倒霉的孩子
- I never liked that little bastard.

1062
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:03,326
你从来没有？  - 嗯
- You haven't? - Mmm-mmm.

1063
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:06,085
他确实不怎么好，你没法相信他
He's just no good. You can't trust him.

1064
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:10,640
你从没说出来过
- You never really hit it off.
他只关心他自己
- All he cares about is himself.

1065
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,924
这不公平
- That's not fair.
去TM的公平，那是事实
- Bullshit fair, it's true.

1066
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:17,844
人们总是关心心里想的事情，这是事实
It's really all anybody cares about if you think about it.

1067
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:21,050
不感兴趣。  - 不感兴趣什么？
- No wonder. - No wonder what?

1068
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:23,687
不感兴趣Chris是否喜欢他自己
No wonder Chris wound up the way he did.

1069
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:27,971
那我做了什么？  -  闭嘴吧！
- What the fuck did I do? - Just shut up.

1070
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,051
我是说你当初有多傻
I mean, how stupid do you have to be

1071
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:32,521
被Rex这白痴给耍了
to let an idiot like Rex take advantage?

1072
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:34,409
Rex？ - 是啊 Rex
- Rex? - Yeah, Rex.

1073
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:36,841
Rex怎么了？  - 我是说。。。
- What about Rex? - I said...

1074
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:39,651
我是说你当初有多傻，被Rex这白痴给耍了
I said, how stupid do you have to be to let an idiot like Rex

1075
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:41,643
占了便宜 -  我听清楚你说什么了
- take advantage? - Yes, I heard what you said.

1076
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:44,724
告诉我这个Rex - Rex 是Adele的男盆友
- Tell me about Rex. - Rex is Adele's boyfriend.

1077
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,006
曾经是
Was.

1078
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:48,529
曾经是Adele 的男盆友
Was Adele's boyfriend.

1079
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:50,885
接着说
Tell me about Rex.

1080
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,327
你想知道什么？  - 不是你
- What do you want to know? - Not you.

1081
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,084
你  - 神马？
- You. - What?

1082
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:58,845
你，接着说这个Rex
You. Tell me about Rex.

1083
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:01,326
干啥？
What do you mean?

1084
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,687
你知道这个人， 我是说你已经见过了
Now, you know the man, don't you? I mean, you have met.

1085
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:06,161
是啊，当然  -  告诉我点其他的
- Yeah, ofcourse. - Tell me about him.

1086
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:07,366
我不明白你啥意思
I don't know what you mean.

1087
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:10,962
高矮胖瘦？或者是个中国人？
Is he tall? is he fat? is he Chinese?

1088
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:13,850
在哪工作？多大年纪？他穿耳洞么？
Where does he work, how old is he, do his ears hang low?

1089
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:17,447
他有什么特征？说说这个Rex
Is he unlike other men? Tell me about Rex.

1090
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:24,168
Rex是
Rex is..

1091
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:31,691
我还是不明白
I don't get this, really.

1092
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:37,523
谁告诉你了这些安排？
Who told you about our arrangement?

1093
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,726
什么安排？
What arrangement?

1094
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,565
这家里，谁告诉你这些事情？
The contract between myself and this family?

1095
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:43,091
Ansel - 肿么了？
- Ansel. - Why?

1096
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:45,049
她是我堂客 Joe
Well, she is my wife. Joe.

1097
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,885
我没问你，先生  - 好吧
- I wasn't addressing you, sir. - Okay.

1098
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:52,083
他为啥要告诉你？
- Why did he tell you?
就像他说的，我是他喔理想（扬州话）
- I'm his wife, like he said.

1099
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,324
你也想分一份么？
Were you gonna get a cut of this money?

1100
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:55,971
当然  - 啥不对么？
- Sure. - Why?

1101
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:59,206
我必尽是他老婆
'Cause I'm his wife, like he said.

1102
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:02,326
你当初有反对Ansel做这个么？
Did you advise Ansel against the idea?

1103
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:04,366
木有
No.

1104
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:05,487
为虾米？
Why?

1105
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:08,770
你有说过Chris会把整件事搞砸么？
You could have told him Chris would fuck it up.

1106
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:11,407
跟我半毛钱关系都没有
It's none of my business.

1107
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,323
但是却是跟你有关系，不是么？
But it is, isn't it?

1108
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:17,449
我是说，那是你的问题
I mean, it is your business.

1109
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,730
那你又会做什么？
What are you getting at?

1110
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,086
既然你也想分一份
If you were going to share in the money,

1111
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,686
这就跟你有关了，不是么？
then it is your business, isn't it?

1112
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:26,481
是啊，我不知道
Yeah, I don't know.

1113
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:30,531
所以你没有反对这计划，对吧
Yet you did not advise Ansel, your husband, against it?

1114
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:38,967
是啊，我却是想得到一份
Look, I wanted some of that money alright.

1115
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:41,611
假如，只是假如，Chris真的能成，我可以。。。
If... If, Chris could pull this off, then I...

1116
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,444
可以分得你老公的一份？
Were you gonna split Ansel's share?

1117
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:46,524
或者你们可以平分4份
or were the four of you gonna split it evenly?

1118
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:50,204
我们没讨论过。  -  我肯定你们讨论过
- We didn't discuss that. - I'm sure you did.

1119
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:53,682
你是很实际的女人
You're a practical woman.

1120
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:01,326
好吧，假设我能分到4分之1
Well, I assumed that I would take a fourth.

1121
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:04,488
不是一半或者3分之1？
Not one-half of one-third?

1122
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:07,769
不是，是4分之1
- No, a fourth, four ways.
不是6分之1
- Instead of one-sixth.

1123
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:09,571
6分之1
One-sixth.

1124
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:13,884
不，4分之1
No. Four ways.

1125
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:15,962
所以剩下的钱会被分开
So the remainder of the money

1126
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:19,203
当你们付给我的我要的费用以后
would be split evenly after I'd been paid my fee.

1127
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,808
- $25,000.
是的，是的
- Right, right. Right.

1128
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:25,805
是啊，得在你的费用付清之后
- Yeah, right after you were covered.
平分
- Which means equal shares.

1129
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:29,563
那这平分的4分从哪里来呢？
What would those four equal shares come out to?

1130
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:34,241
我可没算过
- I haven't done the math.
现在马上给我算算
- Well then do it with me. Right now.

1131
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:50,121
我们拿到了那笔保险金
The insurance policy gets covered.

1132
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,851
Filpatrick给了Ansel一张支票
The agent Filpatrick cuts Ansel a cheque.

1133
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:55,651
Dottie，那是属于Dottie的
Dottie, That would be Dottie.

1134
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:58,366
好吧，好听一点，Dottie
Right, best of all possible worlds, Dottie.

1135
01:17:58,440 --> 01:17:59,885
看吧，我不知道为什么我们做了这些个烂事
Look, I don't know why we're doing all this.

1136
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:01,371
我们一毛也拿不到
We're not gonna see any of that money.

1137
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:02,885
看着我的脚
Just watch my feet here, alright?

1138
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,200
好吧
Alright. Mhmm.

1139
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:06,806
Ansel确实拿到了支票
- So Ansel gets the cheque.
- Dottie.

1140
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,247
- Dottie.
看吧，假设这支票是100000
- Look, if the cheque is for 100,

1141
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:11,049
我们付你25000
We Pay you 25.

1142
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,645
多少？
- How much?
- 25.

1143
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:16,204
这保险金总共有多少？
How much, though, the policy is for?

1144
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:18,681
多少？说啊多少？
However much. How much?

1145
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,882
50000
- 50 thousand.
就这么多？
- That much.

1146
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:24,646
50000减去25000
- 50 minus your 25.
对，减去我的25000
- Right, minus my 25,

1147
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:26,285
但是你说有100000，是么？
but you said 100, didn't you?

1148
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:27,885
是，无论多少，先减去你的
Yeah, however much, minus your money.

1149
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:29,007
不，你说有100000
No, but you said 100.

1150
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:30,525
是的，无论多少
- Yeah, however much.
支票上是100000
- The cheque is for 100.

1151
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,847
不管多少  -  但你说有100000
- However much. - But you said 100.

1152
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:35,844
无论多少，减去你的25000
However much, minus your 25.

1153
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:39,771
Joe她算错了，只有50000
She was mistaken, Joe. It's 50.

1154
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:42,725
对吗？
Alright?

1155
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:44,286
是吗？
Is it?

1156
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:47,806
是的
Yeah.

1157
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:52,088
像Dracula里面的女巫一样围着棍子转圈
Stick around for witches as Christopher Lee

1158
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:55,164
以揭露恐怖旅馆里的女巫大会？
unearths a whole coven at the Horror Hotel.

1159
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:00,608
还是继续加入我们从小镇出发的马拉松？ -狗日的编剧为了前面一段脑残般的胡搅
蛮缠开始洋洋得意的引用起电影场景了
Join us for more of our George Raft marathon. Starting with Whistle Stop.

1160
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:07,168
去屎！快点！
Fuck! Come on!

1161
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:11,361
是不是？
Isn't it?

1162
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:16,567
不
No.

1163
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:19,650
等等
Wait a minute!

1164
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:22,803
假如是事故死亡，赔偿是双倍的
In case of accidental death, the figures double.

1165
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:26,410
是啊， Filpatrick早上告诉我们的，不是吗？Ansel
Right, Filpatrick told us that this morning, didn't he Ansel?

1166
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:32,807
啊！ - 是啊，他说过
- Nah ah. - Yeah, I think he did.

1167
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:35,201
Ansel?

1168
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:37,441
他说过么？
Did he?

1169
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:43,001
不  -  我记得他说过
- No. - I think he did.

1170
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,081
然后。。。
So...

1171
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:51,884
那就不是5W？  - 不
- It's not 50? - No.

1172
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,331
那是10W
It's 100.

1173
01:19:56,360 --> 01:20:00,763
我说过，不管多少  - 无论多少
- Like I say, however much. - However much.

1174
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:03,242
看吧，你都做了什么？
- Look, what are you getting at?
神马意思？
- What do you mean?

1175
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:06,131
我犯了个错误
- I made a mistake alright?
是啊
- Yes, you did.

1176
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:09,409
我说是5W 或者 10W，无论多少 - 嗯
- I said 50 or 100. However much. - Mmm-hmm.

1177
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,324
你们继续算
Y'all gonna do this now?

1178
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,880
你说过，你不关心Chris
You said that you never cared for Chris.

1179
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,371
是的，一点也不
I haven't, I don't.

1180
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:20,564
你也说过Rex是个白痴
And you also said that Rex is an idiot.

1181
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:21,971
是的
Yeah, right.

1182
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:25,050
你还说过，支票上写着10W
And you also said that the cheque was for 100.

1183
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,490
无论多少！
Or however much!

1184
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:32,770
我只是好奇
- I was just wondering.
你做了什么？
- What are you getting at?

1185
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:39,570
该死！
Oh fuck.

1186
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:45,085
这是谁的鸡鸡？
Whose dick is that?

1187
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:47,246
你从哪里弄来的？
Where did you get those?

1188
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:49,090
这不是Ansel的
That's not Ansel's dick.

1189
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:55,964
是你的么？Ansel
Is that your dick, Ansel?

1190
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:58,241
不是
No.

1191
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,088
是我的，亲爱的，你喝多了！
Yes, it is, darling. You were drunk.

1192
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:05,604
那一个呢？
How about that one?

1193
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:07,366
也不是
Nope.

1194
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:11,440
这一个？
That one?

1195
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:14,651
你要确定哦，你可能喝多了
Make sure now, you might have been drunk.

1196
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:18,691
绝对不可能  - 唔
- No. - Hmm.

1197
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:23,007
这是谁的鸡鸡？
Whose dick is it?

1198
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:24,570
住手！
You just stop that.

1199
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:27,964
这绝对是你男盆友的
- That must be your boyfriend.
哦，别介
- Oh, please.

1200
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,527
你男盆友Rex
- Your boyfriend Rex.
哦，别介
- Oh, please now.

1201
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:33,803
那个白痴，那个拿走所有钱的白痴
That idiot. The one who's getting all that money.

1202
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:35,809
我不知道  -  所有的10W
- I didn't know! - All 100 grand.

1203
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:39,003
住手，我发誓，我什么都不知道
Just stop it! I didn't know anything about this, I swear.

1204
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,770
你知道这些么？ Ansel
Were you aware of this, Ansel?

1205
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:44,491
我一点也不知道
- I'm never aware.
当然
- Of course not.

1206
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,251
这是谁的？
Whose is it?

1207
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:54,123
你个狗日的日本人！
You son of a bitch!

1208
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:57,642
别直呼姓名好伐，我都没叫你的名字
There's no need for name calling. I haven't called you any names.

1209
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:00,326
我是客人，你要有点礼貌
I am a guest here, You be polite.

1210
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,081
现在
Now.

1211
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:05,729
告诉我们，这鸡鸡是谁的，别想骗我
Whose little dick is that, and do not lie to me.

1212
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:08,724
你要是想骗我，这将是你最后一个谎言
You lie to me, and it will be the last lie you ever tell.

1213
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:12,522
Rex的  -  Rex的？
- Rex. - Rex?
那是Rex的  - 你确定？
- It's Rex - Who?

1214
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,090
Rex！ - 回答正确
- Rex! - Correct.

1215
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:16,170
Ansel，救救我！
Ansel, please!

1216
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:19,289
Ansel不会帮你的在这一点上
Ansel is not too inclined to assist you at this point in time.

1217
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:20,925
是吧，Ansel
Are you Ansel?

1218
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:22,685
是的，我不会
No, I'm not.

1219
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:25,764
实际上，Ansel做得很好，只是安静的站在那里
In fact, Ansel's doing just fine standing over there.

1220
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:27,760
是的，先生
Yes sir.

1221
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:29,769
那也是我所想的
That's what I thought.

1222
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:33,487
放开我，你个日本人！
- Let me go, you motherfucker!
我刚说了什么，你要再侮辱我的话？
- What did I say about insulting me?

1223
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:43,366
我们会给你钱的，我发誓
We'll give you the money, I swear it.

1224
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:45,369
我们会给你，你想要多少都行
We'll give you as much money as you want!

1225
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:47,522
我恐怕那不可能
I'm afraid that's impossible.

1226
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:49,640
不，不会的
No. ifs not.

1227
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:52,644
Rex 下午就走了
Rex picked up the settlement this afternoon.

1228
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:53,961
神马？
What?

1229
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:56,566
他走之前把支票留给我了
He gave it to me before he left.

1230
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,250
10W
100 grand.

1231
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:02,524
全能的主啊
God Almighty.

1232
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:03,806
他去哪里了？
Where did he go?

1233
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:07,402
当然，对Rex来说，这些都没用了
Worthless, of course. It's made out to Rex.

1234
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:10,767
他说他要去哪里？
Where did he say he was going?

1235
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:14,248
他已经不能说什么了
- He was unavailable for comment.
我不明白
- I don't understand.

1236
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:16,250
你为什么不把他带到。。。
Why didn't you get him to...

1237
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:19,691
是的，我能找到他
I can...

1238
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:20,921
我能找到他
I can get him.

1239
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,208
看来你需要一个新男盆友
Looks like you need a new boyfriend.

1240
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:34,250
我会成为你的新男友，不过就那么一会
I'll be your boyfriend, just for a little while.

1241
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:42,765
躺着别动
Just stay down.

1242
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:45,411
躺下
Stay down.

1243
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,006
看着我
Look at me.

1244
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:57,171
吸这个
Suck this.

1245
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,564
自己打手枪去！
Go fuck yourself!

1246
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:08,121
假如你再侮辱我！
If you insult me again,

1247
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:11,283
我会把你脸撕下来，戴在我的脸上
I will cut your face off and wear it over my own.

1248
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,090
明白了？
Do you understand?

1249
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:15,726
Ansel!

1250
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:18,165
你自找的
You made your bed.

1251
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:19,725
对啊
That's right.

1252
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:21,890
躺下吧
Now lie in it.

1253
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:25,731
吸这个！
Now suck it!

1254
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:29,526
求求你！
Please.

1255
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:33,326
你想我切下你的脸？
Do you want me to wear your face?

1256
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:36,001
吸这个
Now suck it.

1257
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,201
慢点
Easy.

1258
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:54,524
慢点
Easy.

1259
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:58,166
Oh yeah.

1260
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:01,561
Oh yeah, Here we go.

1261
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:05,611
Alright.

1262
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,247
Hey.

1263
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:11,080
Hey!

1264
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,326
你在想什么？
What do you think?

1265
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:18,291
我木有啊！
I don't!

1266
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:23,561
听着，你们俩！
Now listen carefully, both of you.

1267
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:27,204
我完成了你们给的任务
I performed a service for this family.

1268
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:30,728
我应该得到全额报酬
And I deserve my payment in full.

1269
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:35,882
因为一些小误会
Because of a misunderstanding with the insurance,

1270
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:39,764
我并没有得到我的报酬
I won't receive any cash for my services.

1271
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:44,565
这不公平
That is unfair.

1272
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:50,691
我可不在乎你们对于这次过失的借口
I don't care to hear excuses or placement of the blame.

1273
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:55,041
我对你们一视同仁
I hold you all equally responsible.

1274
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:58,730
抱住我的屁屁
Reach around and grab my ass.

1275
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:01,560
抱住我的屁屁
Reach around and grab my ass.

1276
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:05,961
在这里，抓住屁屁，就这样！
There you go. Grab it, That's it.

1277
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:13,720
我是幸运的，不过换一种思维
I was fortunate, however, in thinking ahead.

1278
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:18,371
我救回了我应得的报酬
I secured a retainer for my services.

1279
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:21,521
我已经尽到了我的责任
Since I fulfilled my obligation,

1280
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:25,004
我也无法得到我的现金
and since my cash is not forthcoming,

1281
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:28,250
这些“报酬”应该是我的了
that retainer is now mine.

1282
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:31,446
都是我的
It belongs to me.

1283
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:35,960
我会把它都带走
and I'm taking it with me when I leave.

1284
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:41,284
你很在行啊，继续
You're very good at this. Please moan.

1285
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:51,330
Chris并没同意给你这些奖励啊
Chris doesn't agree with the concept of the retainer.

1286
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:56,808
他晚上会来的，并且会带走她
He's coming here tonight to attempt to take it with him.

1287
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,801
我不会允许的
I can't,

1288
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:05,041
不允许他那样做
allow him to do that.

1289
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:12,961
你们不能
This family can't allow him

1290
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,290
允许他那样做
to do that!

1291
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:21,565
我们必须走了
We have to go.

1292
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:24,889
那让我窒息
It's suffocating me.

1293
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:28,283
我永远也见不到他们了
I can't be around them any more.

1294
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,843
你明白么？
Do you understand me?

1295
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:41,368
我要把你们都杀掉！
I'll slaughter all of you!

1296
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:45,565
假如你们让Chris离开这个拖车的话
If this family allows Chris to leave this trailer,

1297
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:47,768
我会把你们都杀掉
I'll slaughter all of you like pigs!

1298
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:51,088
你们相信我吗？
Do you believe I'd do that?

1299
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:54,204
我在请求你们的帮助
I am asking for your help.

1300
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:58,125
你们会把她给我的
Will you give it to me?

1301
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:01,481
Ansel?

1302
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,086
是，先生
Yes, sir.

1303
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:12,887
你现在看起来很漂亮
Now, you're a very beautiful woman.

1304
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:17,928
你不这样看么？Ansel
Don't you think so, Ansel?

1305
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:21,489
我现在什么也没想
I hadn't given it much thought.

1306
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:24,126
错！ - 错误答案！
- No! -
- Wrong answer!

1307
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:28,087
她看起来很漂亮
She's a very beautiful woman.

1308
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:30,724
也很美丽
And that's sweet.

1309
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:34,805
你同意么？
Don't you think so?

1310
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:41,561
慢点
Easy.

1311
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:43,686
现在
Now, hey.

1312
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:48,606
我需要你把厨房打扫一下
- I want you to tidy up the kitchen.
好的
- Okay.

1313
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:52,921
你们会把桌子从新架好的
And you're gonna set the table for a proper meal.

1314
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,001
你的明白？
Okay?

1315
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:56,566
搬起那把椅子
Get that chair.

1316
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:00,089
让我们坐下来
And we're all gonna sit down.

1317
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:04,324
吃饭  -  好吧
- for dinner. - Okay.

1318
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:06,369
就我们4个
Just the four of us.

1319
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:08,442
明白了吗？看着我
Understand? Look at me.

1320
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:11,565
就一家人
Just the family.

1321
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,604
搬起椅子
Get that chair.

1322
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:40,084
你还好吗？
How you doing, guy?

1323
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:46,966
这照片在哪里拍的？
- Where'd you get them pictures?
那真的很重要
- Oh, that's hardly important.

1324
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:50,811
我猜的话
I guess.

1325
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:55,889
我是说，他只是想含着别人的鸡鸡，从你的口袋里捞钱
I mean, all she did was suck his cock and try and steal your money.

1326
01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:57,803
可能会更坏
It could have been worse.

1327
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:01,726
肿么可能？
How?

1328
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,240
好吧
Well...

1329
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:11,964
我只是猜想会变得很糟
No, I suppose that's about as bad as it gets.

1330
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:17,565
听着
Listen.

1331
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:21,926
去陪陪你老婆
Go spend some time with your wife.

1332
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:32,886
Sharla.

1333
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:35,521
啥？
Yes?

1334
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:37,765
你还好么？
Are you okay?

1335
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:41,884
是，我还活着，Ansel
Yes, I'm fine, Ansel.

1336
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:45,725
你确定？
Are you sure?

1337
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:49,890
是的，我确定
Yes, I'm sure.

1338
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:57,606
好吧
Okay.

1339
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:04,844
闭嘴，T-Bone
Shut up, T-Bone!

1340
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:12,009
嘿，倒霉孩子
Hey, son.

1341
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,926
Dottie在么？  - 在卧室
- Dottie here? - She's in the bedroom.

1342
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:18,887
哦，感谢上帝，我还是到了，Joe来了吗？
Oh thank God, I'm starving. You hear from Joe?

1343
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:20,924
他在他的卧室里
He's in his bedroom.

1344
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:24,045
你吃过了？
You eat already?

1345
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:29,605
Hi Chris.

1346
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:31,886
倒霉孩子
Junior.

1347
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:35,405
你在家
You're home.

1348
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:38,926
Hi, Joe.

1349
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:42,404
我都听说了，关于钱的事
I ehh, heard about the money.

1350
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:45,729
我想告诉你，所有的事都过去了，别妄想把他们从新拼起来
I gotta tell you, I'm all broke up things didn't work out.

1351
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:50,088
我也是
- Yeah me, too.
那是世界的规律，不是么?
- It's the way the world turns, right?

1352
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:51,446
Huh?

1353
