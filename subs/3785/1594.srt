of William Wallace.

00:01:43,735 --> 00:01:47,136
Historians from England
will say I am a liar,

3
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:51,300
but history is written by those
who have hanged heroes.

4
00:01:52,777 --> 00:01:55,974
The king of Scotland
had died without a son,

5
00:01:56,114 --> 00:01:58,082
and the king of England,

6
00:01:58,216 --> 00:02:01,617
a cruel pagan known
as Edward the Longshanks,

7
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,780
claimed the throne of Scotland
for himself.

8
00:02:04,923 --> 00:02:07,790
Scotland's nobles
fought him

9
00:02:07,893 --> 00:02:10,828
and fought each other
over the crown.

10
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:14,831
So Longshanks invited them
to talks of truce...

one page only.

12
00:02:22,741 --> 00:02:25,801
Among the farmers of that shire
was Malcolm Wallace,

13
00:02:25,944 --> 00:02:28,139
a commoner
with his own lands.

14
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,646

We missed him at the council.

We have beaten
the English,

Why is that impossible?

There's a difference

I respect
what you said,

but remember
that these men

and castles.

886
01:36:04,541 --> 01:36:06,441
It's much to risk.

No...

but from top to bottom,

891
01:36:17,954 --> 01:36:20,354
this country has got
no sense of itself.

Tell me, what does that mean...
to be noble?

905
01:36:45,448 --> 01:36:47,006
Your title

to the throne
of our country,

01:46:51,353 --> 01:46:54,720
Will you speak
with a woman?

1006
01:47:13,309 --> 01:47:16,836
I understand you have recently
been given the rank of knight.

1007
01:47:16,979 --> 01:47:18,913
I have been given
nothing.

1008
01:47:19,048 --> 01:47:21,175
God makes men
what they are.

1009
01:47:21,317 --> 01:47:25,048
Did God make you the sacker
of peaceful cities?

1010
01:47:25,154 --> 01:47:27,554
The executioner
of the king's nephew,

1011
01:47:27,656 --> 01:47:29,453
my husband's own cousin?

1012
01:47:29,558 --> 01:47:31,458
York was
the staging point

1013
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:33,960
for every invasion
of my country,

1014
01:47:34,063 --> 01:47:36,463
and that royal cousin
hanged innocent Scots,

1015
01:47:36,565 --> 01:47:38,863
even women and children
from the city walls.

1016
01:47:43,072 --> 01:47:44,903
Well, Longshanks
did far worse

1017
01:47:45,007 --> 01:47:46,872
the last time he took
a Scottish city.

1018
01:47:48,410 --> 01:47:50,776
[Speaking Latin]

1019
01:48:06,462 --> 01:48:08,896
You ask your king
to his face.

1020
01:48:09,031 --> 01:48:09,998
Ask him.

1021
01:48:12,234 --> 01:48:15,726
You see if his eyes
can convince you of the truth.

1022
01:48:24,046 --> 01:48:26,446
Hamilton, leave us.

1023
01:48:28,484 --> 01:48:29,382
Milady...

1024
01:48:29,485 --> 01:48:31,214
Leave us. Now.

1025
01:48:42,064 --> 01:48:44,396
Let us talk plainly.

1026
01:48:44,500 --> 01:48:45,899
You invade England,

1027
01:48:46,001 --> 01:48:48,401
but you cannot
complete the conquest

1028
01:48:48,504 --> 01:48:51,905
so far from your shelter
and supply.

1029
01:48:52,007 --> 01:48:54,532
The king desires peace.

1030
01:48:54,677 --> 01:48:57,578
Longshanks
desires peace?

1031
01:48:57,680 --> 01:48:59,910
He declares it to me.
I swear it.

1032
01:49:00,015 --> 01:49:02,745
He proposes that
you withdraw your attack.

1033
01:49:02,851 --> 01:49:04,876
In return, he grants you
title, estates,

1034
01:49:05,020 --> 01:49:06,487
and this chest of gold,

1035
01:49:06,622 --> 01:49:08,556
which I am to pay
to you personally.

1036
01:49:08,691 --> 01:49:10,921
A lordship and titles...

1037
01:49:11,026 --> 01:49:12,425
gold...

1038
01:49:12,528 --> 01:49:14,155
that I should become
Judas?

1039
01:49:14,296 --> 01:49:16,321
Peace is made
in such ways.

1040
01:49:16,465 --> 01:49:18,160
Slaves are made
in such ways!

1041
01:49:21,036 --> 01:49:23,436
The last time
Longshanks spoke of peace,

1042
01:49:23,539 --> 01:49:24,938
I was a boy,

1043
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:26,439
and many
Scottish nobles,

1044
01:49:26,542 --> 01:49:27,941
who would not be slaves,

1045
01:49:28,043 --> 01:49:30,443
were lured by him,
under a flag of truce,

1046
01:49:30,546 --> 01:49:32,946
to a barn... where
he had them hanged.

1047
01:49:34,650 --> 01:49:36,049
I was very young,

1048
01:49:36,151 --> 01:49:39,552
but I remember
Longshanks' notion of peace.

1049
01:49:42,825 --> 01:49:45,419
I understand
you have suffered.

1050
01:49:47,062 --> 01:49:50,463
I know... about your woman.

1051
01:50:01,076 --> 01:50:02,976
She was my wife.

1052
01:50:05,581 --> 01:50:07,481
We married in secret

1053
01:50:07,583 --> 01:50:11,485
because I would not share her
with an English lord.

1054
01:50:11,587 --> 01:50:15,023
They killed her...
to get to me.

1055
01:50:20,095 --> 01:50:22,996
I have never
spoken of it.

1056
01:50:23,098 --> 01:50:25,999
I don't know why
I tell you now,

1057
01:50:26,101 --> 01:50:27,500
except...

1058
01:50:29,104 --> 01:50:31,231
I see her strength
in you.

1059
01:50:37,613 --> 01:50:41,515
One day,
you'll be a queen...

1060
01:50:41,617 --> 01:50:44,051
And you must
open your eyes.

1061
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:54,461
You tell your king
that William Wallace

1062
01:50:54,563 --> 01:50:56,463
will not be ruled...

1063
01:50:56,565 --> 01:50:59,398
and nor will any Scot
while I live.

1064
01:51:32,952 --> 01:51:35,352
Ah, my son's
loyal wife returns

1065
01:51:35,455 --> 01:51:37,355
unkilled
by the heathen.

1066
01:51:37,457 --> 01:51:39,891
So he accepted
our bribe?

1067
01:51:39,993 --> 01:51:42,018
No, he did not.

1068
01:51:42,128 --> 01:51:44,289
Then why does he stay?

1069
01:51:44,397 --> 01:51:48,731
My scouts tell me that
he has not advanced.

1070
01:51:48,835 --> 01:51:50,803
He waits for you at York.

1071
01:51:50,904 --> 01:51:53,805
He says he will attack
no more towns or cities

1072
01:51:53,907 --> 01:51:56,068
if you are man enough
to come and face him.

1073
01:51:56,176 --> 01:51:58,838
Did he?

1074
01:51:58,945 --> 01:52:03,314
The Welsh bowmen
will not be detected

1075
01:52:03,416 --> 01:52:06,817
arriving so far
around his flank.

1076
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:09,821
The main force
of our armies from France

1077
01:52:09,923 --> 01:52:11,390
will land here

1078
01:52:11,491 --> 01:52:13,391
to the north of Edinburgh.

1079
01:52:13,493 --> 01:52:18,328
Conscripts from Ireland will
approach from the southwest...

1080
01:52:18,431 --> 01:52:19,830
to here.

1081
01:52:19,933 --> 01:52:22,333
Welsh bowmen? Troops from France?
Irish conscripts?

1082
01:52:22,435 --> 01:52:24,335
Even if you
dispatch them today,

1083
01:52:24,437 --> 01:52:26,200
they'd take weeks
to assemble.

1084
01:52:26,306 --> 01:52:30,538
I dispatched them
before I sent your wife.

1085
01:52:34,948 --> 01:52:37,314
So our little ruse
succeeded.

1086
01:52:37,417 --> 01:52:39,442
Thank you.

1087
01:52:39,552 --> 01:52:40,951
And while
this upstart

1088
01:52:41,054 --> 01:52:42,783
awaits my arrival
in York,

1089
01:52:42,889 --> 01:52:47,826
my forces will have arrived
in Edinburgh behind him.

1090
01:52:47,927 --> 01:52:55,595
You spoke with this,
uh, Wallace in private.

1091
01:52:55,702 --> 01:52:58,102
Tell me...

1092
01:52:58,204 --> 01:53:00,968
what kind of man
is he?

1093
01:53:01,074 --> 01:53:04,805
A mindless barbarian.

1094
01:53:04,911 --> 01:53:07,903
Not a king like you,
milord.

1095
01:53:10,416 --> 01:53:12,816
You may return
to your embroidery.

1096
01:53:12,919 --> 01:53:14,318
Humbly, milord.

1097
01:53:14,420 --> 01:53:17,787
You brought back the money,
of course.

1098
01:53:21,427 --> 01:53:23,827
No. I gave it
to ease the suffering

1099
01:53:23,930 --> 01:53:26,490
of the children
of this war.

1100
01:53:26,599 --> 01:53:28,965
[Laughing And Coughing]

1101
01:53:29,068 --> 01:53:31,298
That's what happens
when you send a woman.

1102
01:53:33,439 --> 01:53:34,838
Forgive me, sire.

1103
01:53:34,941 --> 01:53:36,340
I thought that generosity

1104
01:53:36,442 --> 01:53:37,841
might demonstrate
your greatness

1105
01:53:37,944 --> 01:53:40,777
to those
you mean to rule.

1106
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:42,347
Ahem.

1107
01:53:42,448 --> 01:53:43,847
[Cough]

1108
01:53:43,950 --> 01:53:47,283
My greatness will be
better demonstrated

1109
01:53:47,387 --> 01:53:50,220
when Wallace
returns to Scotland

1110
01:53:50,323 --> 01:53:53,292
and finds his country
in ashes.

1111
01:53:53,393 --> 01:53:55,520
[Coughing]

1112
01:53:57,563 --> 01:53:58,791
William!

1113
01:53:58,898 --> 01:54:00,798
There's riders
approaching!

1114
01:54:07,106 --> 01:54:11,304
Personal escort
of the princess.

1115
01:54:11,411 --> 01:54:12,810
Aye.

1116
01:54:14,247 --> 01:54:15,976
Must have made
an impression.

1117
01:54:16,082 --> 01:54:17,310
Aye.

1118
01:54:17,417 --> 01:54:20,318
I didn't think you were
in the tent that long.

1119
01:54:24,424 --> 01:54:25,755
Mademoiselle.

1120

Merci.

1122
01:54:56,389 --> 01:54:59,620
It's true! English ships
are moving up from the south!

1123
01:54:59,726 --> 01:55:01,193
I don't know about
the Welsh yet,

1124
01:55:01,294 --> 01:55:03,194
but the Irish
have landed!

1125
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:06,288
I had to see it
before I could believe it.

1126
01:55:06,399 --> 01:55:08,264
Why are the Irish
fighting with the English?

1127
01:55:08,368 --> 01:55:10,393
I wouldn't worry
about them.

1128
01:55:10,503 --> 01:55:14,269
Didn't I tell you before?
It's my island.

1129
01:55:14,374 --> 01:55:16,274
Hamish, ride ahead
to Edinburgh

1130
01:55:16,376 --> 01:55:17,468
and assemble
the council.

1131
01:55:17,577 --> 01:55:18,601
Order it.

1132
01:55:18,711 --> 01:55:19,609
Aye.

1133
01:55:19,712 --> 01:55:21,236
Hup!

1134
01:55:21,347 --> 01:55:22,507
Hyah!

1135
01:55:23,883 --> 01:55:25,316
Your island?

1136
01:55:25,418 --> 01:55:28,478
My island! Yup!

1137
01:55:28,588 --> 01:55:29,987
You want to negotiate?

1138
01:55:30,089 --> 01:55:31,249
No, please,
gentlemen!

1139
01:55:31,357 --> 01:55:33,723
Lords,
Craig is right!

1140
01:55:33,826 --> 01:55:35,589
This time
our only option

1141
01:55:35,695 --> 01:55:37,925
is to negotiate.

1142
01:55:38,031 --> 01:55:40,499
Unless you want to see Edinburgh
razed to the ground...

1143
01:55:46,372 --> 01:55:48,772
My army has marched
for more days

1144
01:55:48,875 --> 01:55:50,069
than I can remember,

1145
01:55:50,176 --> 01:55:52,542
and we still have
preparations to make,

1146
01:55:52,645 --> 01:55:54,772
so I'll make this plain.

1147
01:55:54,881 --> 01:55:58,282
We require every soldier
you can summon...

1148
01:55:58,384 --> 01:56:01,251
your personal escorts,
even yourselves...

1149
01:56:01,354 --> 01:56:03,049
and we need them now.

1150
01:56:04,891 --> 01:56:06,791
With such a force
arrayed against us,

1151
01:56:06,893 --> 01:56:08,622
it's time to discuss
other options.

1152
01:56:08,728 --> 01:56:10,286
Other options?

1153
01:56:10,396 --> 01:56:13,797
Don't you wish at least
to lead your men

1154
01:56:13,900 --> 01:56:15,299
onto the field

1155
01:56:15,401 --> 01:56:17,801
and barter a better deal
with Longshanks

1156
01:56:17,904 --> 01:56:19,701
before you tuck tail
and run?

1157
01:56:19,806 --> 01:56:20,704
Sire William...

1158
01:56:20,807 --> 01:56:22,035
We cart defeat
this army!

1159
01:56:22,141 --> 01:56:23,267
We can!

1160
01:56:23,376 --> 01:56:24,934
And we will!

1161
01:56:27,413 --> 01:56:31,144
We won at Stirling...
and still you quibble!

1162
01:56:31,250 --> 01:56:34,310
We won at York,
and you would not support us.

1163
01:56:34,420 --> 01:56:36,820
If you'll not
stand up with us now,

1164
01:56:36,923 --> 01:56:38,322
then I say
you're cowards.

1165
01:56:43,629 --> 01:56:46,257
And if you're Scotsmen,

1166
01:56:46,365 --> 01:56:48,765
I'm ashamed
to call myself one.

1167
01:56:48,868 --> 01:56:51,428
Please, Sire William,
speak with me alone.

1168
01:56:54,373 --> 01:56:55,738
I beg you.

1169
01:56:58,878 --> 01:57:01,779
Now, you've achieved more
than anyone ever dreamed,

1170
01:57:01,881 --> 01:57:03,280
but fighting
these odds,

1171
01:57:03,382 --> 01:57:05,782
it looks like rage,
not courage.

1172
01:57:05,885 --> 01:57:07,352
It's well beyond rage.

1173
01:57:09,388 --> 01:57:10,855
Help me.

1174
01:57:12,592 --> 01:57:16,756
In the name of Christ,
help yourselves!

1175
01:57:16,863 --> 01:57:18,763
Now is our chance. Now.

1176
01:57:18,865 --> 01:57:21,095
If we join, we can win.

1177
01:57:21,200 --> 01:57:25,296
If we win, we'll have
what none of us ever had before...

1178
01:57:25,404 --> 01:57:26,803
a country of our own.

1179
01:57:28,908 --> 01:57:31,001
You're the rightful leader.

1180
01:57:31,110 --> 01:57:33,874
And there is strength in you,
I see it.

1181
01:57:39,051 --> 01:57:40,040
Unite us.

1182
01:57:42,755 --> 01:57:44,245
Unite us!

1183
01:57:44,357 --> 01:57:46,120
Unite the clans.

1184
01:57:53,399 --> 01:57:54,764
All right.

1185
01:57:54,867 --> 01:57:56,266
Right.

1186
01:58:00,873 --> 01:58:03,034
This cannot be the way.

1187
01:58:03,142 --> 01:58:05,303
You said yourself...

1188
01:58:05,411 --> 01:58:09,780
the nobles will not
support Wallace.

1189
01:58:09,882 --> 01:58:11,782
So how did it help us

1190
01:58:11,884 --> 01:58:14,785
to join the side
that is slaughtered?

1191
01:58:14,887 --> 01:58:16,787
I gave him my word.

1192
01:58:24,897 --> 01:58:27,297
I know it is hard.

1193
01:58:27,400 --> 01:58:29,561
Being a leader is.

1194
01:58:31,204 --> 01:58:35,300
But, son... son...

1195
01:58:35,408 --> 01:58:36,773
look at me.

1196
01:58:44,083 --> 01:58:45,744
I cannot be king.

1197
01:58:45,851 --> 01:58:49,309
You and you alone
can rule Scotland.

1198
01:58:49,422 --> 01:58:52,323
What I tell you,
you must do.

1199
01:58:52,425 --> 01:58:55,258
Not for me,
not for yourself,

1200
01:58:55,361 --> 01:58:57,261
for your country.

1201
01:59:13,346 --> 01:59:14,745
Eh, lads, make way.

1202
01:59:14,847 --> 01:59:16,747
Coming through here.

1203
01:59:23,356 --> 01:59:24,755
Make way, lads.

1204
01:59:24,857 --> 01:59:26,256
Make...

1205
01:59:30,363 --> 01:59:32,923
The Bruce is
not coming, William.

1206
01:59:33,032 --> 01:59:34,727
He'll come.

1207
01:59:36,702 --> 01:59:39,068
Mornay and Lochlan
have come.

1208
01:59:40,640 --> 01:59:42,267
So will the Bruce.

1209
01:59:45,144 --> 01:59:49,774
Quite the lovely...
gathering.

1210
01:59:49,882 --> 01:59:51,611
Wouldn't you agree?

1211
01:59:54,620 --> 01:59:56,645
The archers
are ready, sire.

1212
01:59:56,756 --> 01:59:58,155
Not the archers.

1213
01:59:58,257 --> 02:00:01,658
My scouts tell me
their archers are miles away

1214
02:00:01,761 --> 02:00:03,661
and no threat to us.

1215
02:00:03,763 --> 02:00:06,129
Arrows cost money.
Use up the Irish.

1216
02:00:06,232 --> 02:00:07,426
The dead cost nothing.

1217
02:00:07,533 --> 02:00:10,627
And send in
the infantry and cavalry.

1218
02:00:10,736 --> 02:00:12,135
Infantry!

1219
02:00:12,238 --> 02:00:13,170
Infantry!

1220
02:00:13,272 --> 02:00:14,170
Cavalry!

1221
02:00:14,273 --> 02:00:15,297
Cavalry!

1222
02:00:15,408 --> 02:00:16,807
Cavalry!

1223
02:00:16,909 --> 02:00:18,240
Cavalry!

1224
02:00:18,344 --> 02:00:19,504
Advance!

1225
02:00:19,612 --> 02:00:21,671
Advance!

1226
02:01:44,830 --> 02:01:48,823
Ah, good to see you
this morning!

1227
02:01:50,169 --> 02:01:52,831
Irish.

1228
02:01:52,938 --> 02:01:55,338
Glad to
have you with us.

1229
02:01:55,441 --> 02:01:56,772
Watch this.

1230
02:02:36,415 --> 02:02:37,848
[Yelling]

1231
02:04:06,539 --> 02:04:09,269
Mornay? Lochlan?

1232
02:04:09,375 --> 02:04:12,173
I gave Mornay double
his lands in Scotland

1233
02:04:12,278 --> 02:04:14,269
and matching estates
in England.

1234
02:04:14,380 --> 02:04:17,781
Lochlan turned
for much less.

1235
02:04:17,883 --> 02:04:19,282
Archers.

1236
02:04:19,385 --> 02:04:20,784
I beg pardon, sire.

1237
02:04:20,886 --> 02:04:22,979
Won't we hit
our own troops?

1238
02:04:25,391 --> 02:04:26,790
Yes...

1239
02:04:26,892 --> 02:04:28,723
but we'll hit theirs
as well.

1240
02:04:28,827 --> 02:04:31,489
We have reserves.

1241
02:04:31,597 --> 02:04:33,064
Attack.

1242
02:04:34,900 --> 02:04:35,992
Archers!

1243
02:04:36,101 --> 02:04:39,002
Archers... attack!

1244
02:04:44,009 --> 02:04:44,998
Loose!

1245
02:04:51,917 --> 02:04:53,441
Loose!

1246
02:05:13,973 --> 02:05:15,372
Send in our reinforcements.

1247
02:05:15,474 --> 02:05:16,668
[Cough]

1248
02:05:16,775 --> 02:05:17,833
Send in the rest!

1249
02:05:28,287 --> 02:05:31,279
Bring me Wallace.

1250
02:05:31,390 --> 02:05:33,290
Alive, if possible.

1251
02:05:33,392 --> 02:05:35,292
Dead... just as good.

1252
02:05:35,394 --> 02:05:37,954
Send us news
of our victory.

1253
02:05:38,063 --> 02:05:39,997
Shall we retire?

1254
02:07:05,150 --> 02:07:06,708
Protect the king.

1255
02:09:10,609 --> 02:09:11,837
Get up!

1256
02:09:11,944 --> 02:09:13,411
Get up!

1257
02:09:14,847 --> 02:09:16,405
Up!

1258
02:09:16,515 --> 02:09:17,743
Get up!

1259
02:09:18,817 --> 02:09:20,580
Get him out of here!

1260
02:09:25,424 --> 02:09:26,982
Go!

1261
02:10:19,978 --> 02:10:22,674
[Cough]

1262
02:10:27,052 --> 02:10:28,383
I'm dying.

1263
02:10:32,557 --> 02:10:33,854
Let me be.

1264
02:10:39,898 --> 02:10:41,798
No.

1265
02:10:41,900 --> 02:10:45,097
You're going to live.

1266
02:10:45,203 --> 02:10:48,900
I've lived long enough
to live free.

1267
02:10:49,007 --> 02:10:54,741
Proud to see you become
the man you are.

1268
02:10:59,351 --> 02:11:01,376
I'm a happy man.

1269
02:12:50,295 --> 02:12:53,230
I'm the one
who's rotting,

1270
02:12:53,331 --> 02:12:57,097
but I think your face
looks graver than mine.

1271
02:13:01,807 --> 02:13:03,240
Son...

1272
02:13:08,814 --> 02:13:11,214
we must have alliance
with England

1273
02:13:11,316 --> 02:13:13,443
to prevail here.

1274
02:13:13,552 --> 02:13:15,713
You achieved that.

1275
02:13:15,821 --> 02:13:17,220
You saved your family,

1276
02:13:17,322 --> 02:13:19,950
increased your land.

1277
02:13:20,058 --> 02:13:25,086
In time, you will have
all the power in Scotland.

1278
02:13:25,197 --> 02:13:31,363
Lands, titles,
men, power... nothing.

1279
02:13:31,470 --> 02:13:32,596
Nothing?

1280
02:13:32,704 --> 02:13:34,262
I have nothing.

1281
02:13:35,707 --> 02:13:37,106
Men fight for me...

1282
02:13:37,209 --> 02:13:40,235
because if they do not,
I throw them off my land

1283
02:13:40,345 --> 02:13:43,644
and I starve their wives
and their children.

1284
02:13:43,748 --> 02:13:49,653
Those men who bled
the ground red at Falkirk...

1285
02:13:49,788 --> 02:13:51,688
they fought for
William Wallace,

1286
02:13:51,790 --> 02:13:55,487
and he fights for
something that I've never had.

1287
02:13:57,162 --> 02:14:01,064
And I took it from him
when I betrayed him,

1288
02:14:01,166 --> 02:14:05,068
and I saw it in his face
on the battlefield,

1289
02:14:05,170 --> 02:14:07,070
and it's tearing me apart!

1290
02:14:07,172 --> 02:14:10,369
Well, all men betray,
all lose heart.

1291
02:14:10,475 --> 02:14:13,171
I don't want
to lose heart!

1292
02:14:16,314 --> 02:14:21,513
I want to believe...
as he does.

1293
02:14:27,325 --> 02:14:30,726
I will never be
on the wrong side again.

1294
02:14:38,336 --> 02:14:39,894
[Snore]

1295
02:15:20,345 --> 02:15:22,245
No!

1296
02:15:35,093 --> 02:15:36,458
[Yelling]

1297
02:15:47,939 --> 02:15:49,497
There he is!
After him!

1298
02:16:18,570 --> 02:16:21,767
Lord Craig,
is it true about Mornay?

1299
02:16:21,873 --> 02:16:26,833
Aye. Wallace rode into his bedchamber
and killed him.

1300
02:16:26,978 --> 02:16:29,879
More a liability now
than ever he was.

1301
02:16:29,981 --> 02:16:33,212
And there's no telling
who'll be next.

1302
02:16:34,819 --> 02:16:36,343
Maybe you.

1303
02:16:38,556 --> 02:16:40,023
Maybe me.

1304
02:16:45,764 --> 02:16:47,527
It doesn't matter.

1305
02:16:49,434 --> 02:16:50,833
I'm serious, Robert.

1306
02:16:50,935 --> 02:16:52,334
So am I!

1307
02:17:05,684 --> 02:17:07,584
Christ! Shit!

1308
02:17:07,686 --> 02:17:10,348
Search the place!

1309
02:17:13,258 --> 02:17:14,350
Lochlan.

1310
02:17:21,399 --> 02:17:24,197
William Wallace
killed 50 men.

1311
02:17:24,302 --> 02:17:26,702
50 if it was one.

1312
02:17:26,805 --> 02:17:27,931
100 men...

1313
02:17:28,039 --> 02:17:29,438
with his own sword.

1314
02:17:29,541 --> 02:17:31,338
Cut through them like...

1315
02:17:31,443 --> 02:17:34,606
Moses through
the Red Sea.

1316
02:18:06,778 --> 02:18:09,372
His legend grows.

1317
02:18:09,481 --> 02:18:12,211
It will be worse
than before.

1318
02:18:12,317 --> 02:18:15,218
He rallies new volunteers
in every Scottish town,

1319
02:18:15,320 --> 02:18:17,185
and when he replenishes
his numbers...

1320
02:18:17,288 --> 02:18:19,722
They're sheep!
Mere sheep!

1321
02:18:19,824 --> 02:18:21,314
[Coughing]

1322
02:18:21,459 --> 02:18:24,895
Easily dispersed
if we strike the shepherd.

1323
02:18:25,029 --> 02:18:26,690
Very well.

1324
02:18:26,798 --> 02:18:30,199
Pick a flock
of your finest assassins

1325
02:18:30,301 --> 02:18:31,700
and set a meeting.

1326
02:18:31,803 --> 02:18:35,034
Milord, Wallace
is renowned

1327
02:18:35,140 --> 02:18:37,700
for his ability
to smell an ambush.

1328
02:18:40,311 --> 02:18:44,145
If what Lord Hamilton tells me
is correct,

1329
02:18:44,249 --> 02:18:46,149
he warmed to
our future queen.

1330
02:18:46,251 --> 02:18:48,048
He would trust her.

1331
02:18:49,721 --> 02:18:51,985
So we'll dispatch her
with the notion

1332
02:18:52,090 --> 02:18:53,387
that she comes in peace.

1333
02:18:53,491 --> 02:18:56,255
Milord, the princess
might be taken hostage

1334
02:18:56,361 --> 02:18:58,659
or her life
be put in jeopardy.

1335

Oh, my son would be
most distressed by that.

Uh, but in truth,
if she were to be killed,

1337
02:19:06,137 --> 02:19:09,937
we would soon find
the king of France

02:19:10,041 --> 02:19:12,202
a useful ally
against the Scots.

1339

You see, as king,

you must find the good
in any situation.

1341

It's William Wallace, sure.

I received your message.

Oh.

This is...
the second time

Why?

There will be
a new shipment of supplies

coming north next month...
foods and weapons.

No, stop.

Why do you help me?

Why do you help me?

our noble saviors

Sire William, we've come
to seek a meeting.

02:24:37,068 --> 02:24:39,628
Well, what's the point?

1365
02:24:39,771 --> 02:24:41,966
You've all sworn loyalty
to Longshanks.

1366
02:24:42,106 --> 02:24:44,666
An oath to a liar
is no oath at all.

Every man of us is ready
to swear loyalty to you.

1368
02:24:47,645 --> 02:24:49,704
So let the council
swear publicly.

1369
02:24:49,847 --> 02:24:53,681
We cannot. Some scarcely
believe you're alive.

1370
02:24:53,785 --> 02:24:56,185
Others think you'll pay
them Mornay's wages.

So we bid you
to Edinburgh.

Meet us two days
from now.

1373

Pledge us your pardon,
and we'll unite behind you.

1374

Scotland will be one.

No.

I mean this.

1378
02:25:13,137 --> 02:25:15,435
It's the pledge
of Robert the Bruce.

1379
02:25:25,149 --> 02:25:27,140
You do know it's a trap.
Tell him.

1380
02:25:27,285 --> 02:25:29,150
If the Bruce
wanted to kill you,

1381
02:25:29,253 --> 02:25:30,686
he'd have done it
at Falkirk.

1382
02:25:30,822 --> 02:25:31,880
Aye.

1383

Leave him aside.
What about the others?

Look at us.

1389
02:25:45,269 --> 02:25:47,169
We've got to try.

1390
02:25:47,271 --> 02:25:49,671
We cart do
this alone.

1391
02:25:49,774 --> 02:25:52,174
Joining the nobles
is the only hope for our people.

1392

You know what happens
if we don't take that chance?

1393
02:25:54,912 --> 02:25:55,970
What?

1394
02:25:56,113 --> 02:25:57,137
Nothing.

Aye, I do.

I've asked God
for those things.

It's all for nothing
if you don't have freedom.

Will he show mercy
to my country?

02:33:13,651 --> 02:33:16,142
I must have them all.

1494
02:33:16,287 --> 02:33:18,187
For if I'm senseless,
or if I wail,

1495
02:33:18,289 --> 02:33:21,690
then Longshanks
will have broken me.

1496
02:33:21,792 --> 02:33:24,625
I cart bear the thought
of your torture.

1497
02:33:24,728 --> 02:33:26,252
Take it.

1498
02:33:31,101 --> 02:33:32,591
All right.

1499
02:34:19,583 --> 02:34:25,044
I have come to beg
for the life of William Wallace.

1500
02:34:25,155 --> 02:34:29,285
You're quite taken
with him, aren't you?

1501
02:34:29,393 --> 02:34:31,224
I respect him.

1502
02:34:33,664 --> 02:34:35,894
At worst,
he was a worthy enemy.

1503
02:34:35,999 --> 02:34:37,796
Show mercy,
O thou great king,

1504
02:34:37,901 --> 02:34:40,062
and win the respect
of your own people.

1505
02:34:49,680 --> 02:34:55,243
Even now...
you are incapable of mercy.

02:35:07,197 --> 02:35:10,291
To you, that word is
as unfamiliar as love.

1509
02:35:10,401 --> 02:35:13,097
Before he lost
his powers of speech,

1510
02:35:13,203 --> 02:35:15,603
he told me his
one comfort was that

1511
02:35:15,706 --> 02:35:17,936
he would live to know
Wallace was dead.

1512

You see...

1513

death comes to us all.

1514
02:35:51,909 --> 02:35:55,572
But before
it comes to you,

1515
02:35:55,679 --> 02:35:58,079
know this...

1516
02:35:58,182 --> 02:36:02,084
Your blood dies with you.

1517
02:36:02,186 --> 02:36:06,088
A child who is not of your line
grows in my belly.

Your son will not sit long
