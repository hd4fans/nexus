某个人曾告诉过你，走失的时候应该这么做，对吧

Not much of a letter writer, your mother.

特别是这幅还有那幅，还有墙上的那幅

A homosexual and a black pothead?

Yeah. Wait. So you drive a taxi?

300
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,222
Well, it's an excellent way of learning
这是了解不同人群的

301
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,814
about all different kinds of people.

Well, there is no such thing as trying to write.

One writes,or one doesn't.

You have to take every opportunity to practice your craft.

323
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:09,016
You need anything? Aside from the Pollock?
你还要什么么？除了波洛克？

324
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:10,513

00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,556
All right. Well, au revoir, then.

It's a fucking Jackson Pollock painting.

Jackson Pollock? Jesus!
杰克森・波洛克？老天啊！

332
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,177
Hmm.
嗯

333
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:45,755
Pollock spelled his name wrong when he signed it.
波洛克签名的时候都拼错了

334
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,186
So then he gives me a gift,

335

a Jackson Pollock painting.

So after 18 years of wondering,

here's what I learned about my father.
老爸终于让我明白了一件事

他是个种族主义者，恐同者，还他妈的是个疯子

340
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:05,338
Can you reach him? I mean, if you wanted to?
你能联系到他么？如果你想联系他的话？

341
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,469
I don't know that I ever want to see him again. Really.

I don't know how I feel about it.

I can't really locate what I feel.

None of that. We're friends now.

我想说，我们存在世间的意义就是帮助他人，不是么？

Plus, the pay is not bad. Next.

There were the ex-cons.

All right, next. So this dude was gonna shoot me, right?
好了，下一个。我问他说，这人是想朝我开枪么？

415
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:01,305
So, I turned sideways,'cause that is what you do.
我侧过身去，这是你第一时间要做的

416
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,814
You turn sideways,you take it in the arm.
转过身去，你就能用胳膊挡住子弹

417
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,544
I flex my bicep,I take the bullet.
我让手臂的肌肉收缩，接下了那颗子弹

418
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:11,214
And then I grabbed the gun from this guy, and I'm like bam-bam-bam-bam.
接着我从那人手里夺过枪，接着就是砰砰砰砰

419
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:13,917
Right in his fucking head, then it's like click-click-click.
直接打在他的脑袋上，几枪之后就只剩扳机扣动的咔哒声

420
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:18,291
Let me tell you, I had to disappear for a while after that.
告诉你，在那件事之后我不得不消失一段时间

421

All right, put your arms up.

Now, she's like a mother to the guys.

Unfortunately, in a couple of years,

she will be sitting in a room with a shotgun across her lap,
她需要坐在一个房间里，膝盖上摆着一把猎枪

back to dealing and smoking crack 24/7.

It's hard to stay changed.

429
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:38,275
I start out working inside the cage handing out bed tickets,

（注：以铁丝网分割的小工作间通常称之为cage）

往前走，老头！你为什么总要动我？

Because you are standing still, that's why.
因为你站着不动，就是这样

Every single day, I get in line, and you're right up my ass.

Yeah, maybe not.Not yet.

There is a balance between escalating and defusing.
在事态的升级与减弱中存在某种平衡

I don't know that balance yet.

你之前没跟我说过这里这么乱啊

451

你会上瘾的。当心点，否则你一辈子都离不开这里了

I couldn't tell you.

But what I do know is a year from now,
但我知道的是，在过去的一年里

问题是，克莱尔的妈妈来了，她和我们住在一起

We are renovating the guest room.

No. That's ancient history.
不是，那只是个古代传说

You are not just selling weed, right?
你不只是做大麻生意吧？

808

Watch your hands.Watch your hands.
小心手，小心手

809
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,501
Why should a truly great writer

810
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:47,440
be subjected to these fucking indignities?
要接受这种无礼的对待

811
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:54,248
There we go.

812
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:56,744
What are you doing? That's my property.
你干什么？这是我的东西

Come on,get out of here.

That's my property.That's my property.

I'm going to transform this cesspool of a world.

It's been weeks.

you want to do some blow?
你想吸点粉么？

825

00:51:33,557 --> 00:51:35,081
I despise blow.

Turns people into fucking scumbags.

828
00:51:39,062 --> 00:51:41,394
But you go ahead if you want to.

It's cold out there, man.

waiting for 8:00 p.m. to come...

845
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:37,945
The beaten, the sad, the losers in life's great game.
和那些醉汉，乞丐，以及被生活这场巨大的游戏所打败的人比肩而坐

846
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:42,653
Jody would have laughed loudly at the entire macabre scene.
这幅可怕的场景想必会使朱迪忍俊不禁

851

Don't be sorry. Sorry for what?

Wait until you have been here a few months.

该死的老妈？你怎么敢这样称呼她？

879

你又有什么资格对我说“你怎么敢”这种话

Well, let me rephrase it. Don't fucking write to me about my mother.
好吧，我换个说法，别他妈写信跟我说我妈的事

881
00:54:57,661 --> 00:55:01,028

你说出这样不敬的话只会使你显得不成熟

Sorry, you don't get to patronize me. Okay?
别在我面前摆出一副屈尊俯就的样子成么？

如果你再带酒进来，你就永远别想在这睡觉了，你就玩完了

Eano the Beano tells me you are into drugs.
有人告诉我你吸毒了

894
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:31,750
Who the fuck is Eano the Beano? How would he know that?

Everybody knows,the word is out.

You know, if so,good luck to you.

But don't waste your talent.

899
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:40,928
I find that hard to believe.

900
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:43,370
Why? Because you're so incredibly talented?
为什么？因为你是如此难以置信地有才？

901

00:55:49,946 --> 00:55:51,971
Where are you hiding it?

Can I read it? Does it even exist?

Do you even know?

在那里，我家那位小丑随时都可能出现在我面前

You look really fucked up, by the way.
顺便说一下，你看起来脸色很差

Up yours, Harbor Street.
去你的港湾街

1215
01:16:49,304 --> 01:16:52,034
You are still barred from Harbor Street.
你还在港湾街的禁入期

1216
01:16:58,213 --> 01:17:00,545
I think I have been here before.
我想我之前来过这里

1217
01:17:01,216 --> 01:17:04,515
Yeah, I was mugged here once by a bunch of mother-raping drug addicts.
上次在这我被一群操娘的小毒罐子给抢了

1218
01:17:04,586 --> 01:17:05,575
Thanks, Jeff.
谢谢，杰夫

1219
01:17:05,654 --> 01:17:06,678
Good luck.
祝你好运

1220
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:11,425
Christ, don't tell me you live here.
老天啊，别告诉我你就住这儿

1221
01:17:11,493 --> 01:17:13,256
A fucking hellhole.
这真他妈的是个老鼠洞

1222
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:20,996
I'll have a vodka screwdriver, please.
来杯螺丝起子
（注：Screwdriver，一种由伏特加和橙汁调和成的鸡尾酒）

1223
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:23,535
There is no liquor here.
这儿没酒

1224
01:17:23,605 --> 01:17:25,368
No vodka? No vodka.
- 没有伏特加？ - 没有

1225
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,067
No vodka.
没有伏特加

1226
01:17:28,343 --> 01:17:30,641
Fine, it's evil shit anyway.
好吧，反正也不是什么好东西

1227
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:34,876
You know, I'm putting some money aside.
我存了些钱

1228
01:17:36,184 --> 01:17:38,709
I'm going to get my life back together.
我准备重新开始我的生活

1229
01:17:38,787 --> 01:17:40,812
I got a friend in Florida.
我在佛罗里达有个朋友

1230
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:45,586
He's got a job and an apartment,they're waiting for me in St. Petersburg.
他给我准备了一份工作和一间公寓，在圣彼得堡

1231
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:46,821
Right.
是啊

1232
01:17:53,268 --> 01:17:55,293
You don't believe me,do you?
你不相信我是吧？

1233
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:56,894
No. No.
不信 - 不信？

1234
01:17:56,972 --> 01:17:59,133
That's a terrible thing to say,
真是太让我难过了

1235
01:17:59,207 --> 01:18:00,606
you don't believe your own father.
你居然不相信自己的父亲

1236
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:02,906
I'm going upstairs,go to bed.
我上楼睡觉去了

1237
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:05,912
My roommates are away for the weekend.
我室友周末不在

1238
01:18:05,981 --> 01:18:08,472
You will be unbarred in a few days,
再过几天你的禁令就解除了

1239
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:10,575
so you can stay here for a bit.
所以在你回港湾街之前

1240
01:18:11,586 --> 01:18:12,848
Until you go back to Harbor Street...
你可以在我这呆几天

1241
01:18:12,921 --> 01:18:15,082
Oh, no, I'm never going back to that fucking place.
哦，不，我绝对不要再回去那里了

1242
01:18:16,224 --> 01:18:17,316
Never.
永远不要

1243
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:19,254
Oh, no.
哦，不

1244
01:18:20,295 --> 01:18:21,728
Oh, no.
哦，不

1245
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:26,559
Hey, don't drink in here.
喂，别在这里喝酒

1246
01:18:26,635 --> 01:18:28,603
You know, I have been thinking about your beautiful mother
我一直在思考你的漂亮老妈

1247
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:29,694
and her non-accident.
和她那个“非意外”的事

1248
01:18:29,771 --> 01:18:33,002
And I have been thinking, why would she do something like that?
我在想，她为什么要那么做呢？

1249
01:18:35,844 --> 01:18:36,902

1250
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:39,544
Do you want a drink? No.
喝一口？- 不了

1251
01:18:39,614 --> 01:18:41,741
Oh, right. You prefer the other stuff.
哦，好吧，你不喜欢酒

1252
01:18:41,817 --> 01:18:43,512
I think I have a problem with both.
我对这两件事都有疑问

1253
01:18:43,585 --> 01:18:45,018
A problem?
有疑问？

1254
01:18:45,754 --> 01:18:47,278
Oh, I feel for you.
哦，我能感觉到

1255
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:50,090
It must be problematic.
一定不是什么简单的问题

1256
01:18:56,698 --> 01:18:59,792
The night she did it,she read something I wrote.
那天晚上，她读了我写的东西

1257
01:19:00,869 --> 01:19:02,996
A story, she thought it was about her.
一个故事，他觉得那是在说她

1258
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:04,402
Was it?
是么？

1259
01:19:06,842 --> 01:19:07,866
Yes.
确实是

1260
01:19:09,811 --> 01:19:12,177
It was about a woman who works two jobs
我写了一个女人，身兼二职

1261
01:19:12,247 --> 01:19:14,772
and tries to fit in a couple of hours
并且努力从两份工作的空档中挤出时间

1262
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:16,750
between each to be with her kid.
来陪她的孩子

1263
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,888
She works as a bank teller.
她是银行出纳

1264
01:19:20,956 --> 01:19:22,924
She works as a waitress.
也是餐厅服务员

1265
01:19:23,625 --> 01:19:25,252
She comes home and waits on the kid.
她回家还要带孩子

1266
01:19:35,804 --> 01:19:38,932
I wasn't finished with the story.
我没有写完那个故事

1267
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:44,203
I was going to write how the kid appreciated it,
我打算在后面写出那个孩子的感激之情

1268
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:46,509
whatever time she had for him.
不管她陪在他身边的时间是长是短

1269
01:19:48,116 --> 01:19:50,710
He didn't think she was a bad mother.
他从来都觉得她是个好妈妈

1270
01:19:52,587 --> 01:19:54,452
And he loved her.
他爱她

1271
01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:57,820
She was all he had.
她是他的全部

1272
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:04,221
I didn't write that part.
我没有写这个部分

1273
01:20:06,701 --> 01:20:08,225
I didn't get that far.
我还没有写到那里

1274
01:20:08,436 --> 01:20:10,563
So that's the story you tell
所以这就是你认为的

1275
01:20:11,339 --> 01:20:12,704
of why your mother killed herself.
你妈自杀的原因

1276
01:20:13,008 --> 01:20:14,236
I haven't told it to anyone.
我从没对任何人说起过这个故事

1277
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:16,709
You tell it to yourself. Those are the best stories.
你对你自己说过，这些故事是最好的

1278
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:20,444
It's a good yarn.
很好的故事

1279
01:20:20,515 --> 01:20:23,313
There is only one part that's horseshit.
但有一个相当扯淡的部分

1280
01:20:23,752 --> 01:20:26,653
No one kills themselves because they read a story.
没有人会因为读了一个故事而自杀

1281
01:20:26,721 --> 01:20:28,518
I don't care how good a writer you are,
无论多么优秀的作家

1282
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:31,218
you can't kill someone with words.
都无法做到单凭文字就扼杀一个生命

1283
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:34,586
I have a theory.
我有一个看法

1284
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:37,359
The reason people commit suicide
那些自杀的人

1285
01:20:37,432 --> 01:20:39,491
is because they don't like themselves.
理由无非是他们不爱自己

1286
01:20:39,568 --> 01:20:40,967
Self-hatred.
厌恶自己

1287
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:46,031
I think it's a very reasonable explanation. Don't you?
很合理的解释，不是么？

1288
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:47,532
Self-hatred?
自我厌恶？

1289
01:20:47,609 --> 01:20:49,133
You're familiar with the concept?
你对这个概念不陌生吧？

1290
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:51,570
Yes.
嗯

1291
01:20:54,316 --> 01:20:55,647
Of course,
当然了

1292
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:59,654
maybe the question isn't why she killed herself when she did,
也许问题不在为什么她自杀

1293
01:20:59,721 --> 01:21:02,690
but why she chose to stick around as long as she did.
而是她为何要选择活下去

1294
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:17,334
Anyway, my writing is going extremely well.
不管怎么说，我的写作进展相当顺利

1295
01:21:17,405 --> 01:21:19,134
The book's classic.
那本书真是一流的

1296
01:21:22,043 --> 01:21:25,012
And to answer your previous question, it does exist.
回答一下你先前提出的那个质疑，这本书确实存在

1297
01:21:25,747 --> 01:21:26,839
As do you.
你也一样

1298
01:21:26,915 --> 01:21:27,973
Why?
为什么？

1299
01:21:28,049 --> 01:21:30,916
Because of me. Because I made you.
因为我啊，我生了你

1300
01:21:35,957 --> 01:21:37,948
I'm going to go to sleep.
我要去睡觉了

1301
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:40,953
The blanket's on the couch.
毯子在沙发上

1302
01:22:53,068 --> 01:22:54,126
Hey!
喂！

1303
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:57,438
Hey! Hold on!
喂！等一下！

1304
01:22:58,974 --> 01:22:59,963
Hey.
喂

1305
01:23:00,041 --> 01:23:01,508
What are you doing? Where you going?
你干嘛，你要去哪？

1306
01:23:01,576 --> 01:23:03,567
Where am I going? I'm going to my suite at The Ritz.
去哪？去我在利兹酒店的套房啊

1307
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:07,479
They are holding one for me just in case I ever want to drop by and use it.
他们有一间永远为我待命的套房呢

1308
01:23:07,549 --> 01:23:09,710
I gotta get going. I'll be late for the slave traders,
我得走了，不然上班就来不及了

1309
01:23:09,784 --> 01:23:11,342
all the jobs will be taken.
工贩那的临时职位可都很热门呢

1310
01:23:11,519 --> 01:23:12,645
Well, are you coming back?
你还回来么？

1311
01:23:12,721 --> 01:23:14,154
Coming back where? Here.
回来哪里？ - 这里

1312
01:23:20,628 --> 01:23:21,686
Out of curiosity,
出于好奇我得问一下

1313
01:23:21,763 --> 01:23:24,163
why have you not ever asked me to stay with you before?
你之前怎么都没叫我留下来过？

1314
01:23:26,234 --> 01:23:30,466
I thought if you try and save a drowning man you might go down, too.
我觉得如果你去救一个溺水的人，你也会跟着沉下去的

1315
01:23:33,675 --> 01:23:35,199
A drowning man?
溺水的人？

1316
01:23:36,044 --> 01:23:37,944
A drowning man?
溺水的人？

1317
01:23:38,446 --> 01:23:40,437
I'm not a drowning man.
我可不是溺水的人

1318
01:23:40,749 --> 01:23:43,445
I'm a survivor! An artist!
我是一个生存者，艺术家！

1319
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:45,247
I'm not going to die out here
我可不会死在外头

1320
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:48,585
I'm not your poor sensitive mother! I'm a survivor!
我跟你那敏感的可怜老妈不一样，我是个生存家！

1321
01:23:48,656 --> 01:23:49,918
And you know what?
你知道么？

1322
01:23:49,991 --> 01:23:53,290
Luckily for you, you are my son, so you are one, too!
成为我的儿子是一大幸事，因为你也将继承生存家的本领

1323
01:23:54,162 --> 01:23:57,222
You are not your mother and you are not me, Nicholas Flynn!
你不是你妈，也不是我，尼古拉斯・弗林！

1324
01:23:57,298 --> 01:23:58,595
I absolve you!
我现在宣告你为独立的个体！

1325
01:23:58,666 --> 01:24:01,533
You are not me. I made you, but you are not me!
你不是我，我生了你，但你和我不同！

1326
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:17,540
I'll see you again.
再会

1327
01:24:17,619 --> 01:24:18,677
Yeah.
好吧

1328
01:24:19,421 --> 01:24:22,413
A few months after that I left Harbor Street.
几个月后，我离开了港湾街

1329
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:24,457
Yo, it's the man.
呦，是你啊

1330
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:26,249
I'll see you later, man.
待会见

1331
01:24:26,327 --> 01:24:28,192
All right. Be good.
好啦，小心点

1332
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:35,229
Yeah.
嗯

1333
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:36,901
All right.
好啦

1334
01:24:41,576 --> 01:24:42,600
Hey.
嘿

1335
01:24:43,278 --> 01:24:44,336
Hey.
嘿

1336
01:24:45,113 --> 01:24:46,205
I'm taking off.
我要走了

1337
01:24:46,281 --> 01:24:47,373
Yeah, I heard.
嗯，听说了

1338
01:24:47,682 --> 01:24:49,411
Thanks. - For what?
谢啦 - 谢什么？

1339
01:24:49,484 --> 01:24:51,247
For nothing.
没有

1340
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:54,017
For the swift kick in the ass.
谢谢你踹醒我的那一脚

1341
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:55,613
You're welcome.
不客气

1342
01:24:56,024 --> 01:24:57,150
No more Harbor Street, huh?
不会再回来了吧

1343
01:24:57,225 --> 01:24:58,283
I guess not.
我想不会

1344
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:00,890
What about you, you gonna stay here for a while?
你呢，还要再做一段时间？

1345
01:25:00,962 --> 01:25:02,930
Yeah. I'm not done yet.
嗯，我的事还很多

1346
01:25:05,633 --> 01:25:07,601
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
我只想说声对不起

1347
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:09,732
For what?
对不起什么？

1348
01:25:11,606 --> 01:25:13,335
About your brother.
你弟弟的事

1349
01:25:14,409 --> 01:25:15,467
Oh.
哦

1350
01:25:17,745 --> 01:25:19,076
Thank you.
谢谢

1351
01:25:33,027 --> 01:25:34,085
Take care of yourself.
