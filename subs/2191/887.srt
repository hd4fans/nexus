Please, the Queen
is going to kill me.

Sure she is.

341

Why does the Queen want you dead?

She wants everyone
dead, all of us.

I need to get to the Duke's castle.

here, isn't it?

you're dead.

I'm dead.

how much reward?

asked the Queen that.

before you lose a finger.

with just the palm of her hand

from her side with no blood.

into the Dark Forest.
