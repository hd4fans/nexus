1
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,320
Hey, Jenny.
That was a wonderful share, tonight.

2
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:24,548
"Chapter 36, The Quarter-Deck.

3
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,300
"Enter Ahab. Then, all.

4
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,804
”It was not a great while
after the affair of the pipe,

5
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:34,557
”that one morning, shortly after breakfast,
Ahab, as was his wont,

6
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:37,355
"ascended the cabin-gangway to the deck.

7
00:01:55,449 --> 00:02:00,125
"'It's a white whale, I say 'resumed Ahab,
as he threw down the top-maul.

8
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:04,208
"SQ white whale-
Skin your eyes for him, men,

9
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,841
"'look sharp for white water,
if ye see but a bubble, sing out.

10
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,622
Tommy?

11
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,996
Jesus!

12
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,384
What are you doing here?

13
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,795
Well, I was just passing through

14
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:53,724
and I figured why not have a belt
with the old man.

15
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,551
Yeah.

16
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,393
She looks good.

17
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,359
Yeah, she's hanging in there.

18
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,405
Well, you always did take good care of her.

19
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,358
Paddy Conlon.

20
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,074
Man of priorities.

21
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,588
I got a little something for you.

22
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,755
Mom always said,
"Never go anywhere empty-handed."

23
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,086
She did.

24
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,926
That's not for me any more, Tommy.

25
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,637
What? You changed brands?

26
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,021
Let's go inside, huh?

27
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:47,611
Tommy!

28
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,273
Come on, let's go inside.

29
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,131
I like what you've done with the place.

30
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,683
Yeah, I appreciate that.

31
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:22,805
There's not much of a woman's touch
around here.

32
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,641
Yeah, well...

33
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,402
And no more women for me, Tommy.

34
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,113
Yeah.

35
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:36,410
It must be hard to find a girl
who can take a punch nowadays.

36
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,576
Here you go.

37
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,254
Coffee?

38
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,168
You haven't seen a guy in 14 years
and you're not gonna have a drink with him?

39
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,379
- Come on.
- I told you, I'm off it, Tommy.

40
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,339
I'm coming up on 1,000 days.

41
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:04,350
- Come on, it's just a drink.
- No.

42
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,968
He's a school teacher down in Philly.

43
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,221
Remember Tess?

44
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:41,015
They had two beautiful little girls.

45
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,499
So, you found God, huh? That's awesome.

46
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:14,341
I think Mom kept calling out for him,
but he wasn't around.

47
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:20,806
I guess Jesus was down at the mill
forgiving all the drunks, huh?

48
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,592
Just 12.

49
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:31,684
Did your guy tell you
what you needed to know?

50
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,445
Just that your mother died in Tacoma.

51
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,653
But you were in the Marines.

52
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:40,901
That was all.

53
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,658
That was enough.

54
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,159
Well, that's too bad,

55
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:53,455
'cause you could've gotten
some good details.

56
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,751
Who knew?

57
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,389
So, you gonna ask about her,

58
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:09,312
or you just gonna sit there all sober?

59
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:14,025
- I know.
- You know? What do you know? Huh?

60
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:17,316
Do you know it wasn't enough to drive west
to get away from you,

61
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,114
that once we hit the water,
we drove north, too?

62
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,911
When I got sober, I hired a man to find you.

63
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,285
And is that one of the 12 steps?

64
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,541
Or does a guy like you get 24?

65
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:36,206
You could've heard about her
coughing up blood on her knees

66
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,171
in a shit box with no heat.

67
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:45,884
Having me rub her down with holy water,
because, well, she didn't have no insurance.

68
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:51,639
All the time waiting for your pal,
Jesus, to save her.

69
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,442
Did your man tell you that?

70
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,106
I'm sorry, Tommy.

71
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,374
Well, it's good to know
that you're sorry, Pop.

72
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,496
It goes a long way.

73
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,971
I think I liked you better
when you were a drunk.

74
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,146
All right, then. All right, all right, all right.

75
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,856
You say I can, but you say I can't.

76
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,159
- What about if we all get a unicorn?
- No.

77
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,781
- Don't you want a unicorn?
- No.

78
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,412
What's going on up here?

79
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,164
- Oh, my goodness.
- Well, I'm not sure,

80
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,873
but I think Daddy is now a princess.

81
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,754
- Daddy, you look so handsome.
- Do I?

82
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,585
- He's a very pretty princess.
- We're painting Daddy's face.

83
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,754
Yeah, you are.

84
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,768
Okay. Yeah.
Em, you wanna open your presents?

85
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,015
- Yeah? You wanna do present time? Okay.
- Yeah. All right, come on. Ready?

86
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,691
- All right! It's time for presents!
- I have to put this down.

87
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,735
- Here. You wanna put it down?
- Presents time!

88
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,733
- Everybody, come bring your presents!
- What is it? What is it?

89
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,613
Let's start with this one.
How about that, Emily?

90
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,948
- All right.
- Happy birthday, Emily.

91
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,655
- What did you get? What did you get?
- Babe?

92
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,449
It's an awfully big box.

93
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,326
It's her birthday. Come on.

94
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,161
I know, babe,
but that's why you call it a budget.

95
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,838
You set it and you don't budge.

96
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,837
- This one's mine.
- Hey, open the big box!

97
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,376
It's okay.

98
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,006
- I love you. Be good, okay?
- Bye, Mommy.

99
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,343
Daddy's gonna give you a bath.

100
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,846
- Hey, babe. I'm late.
- Hey.

101
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,352
Mom's saying goodbye to the girls,
she's got to get on the road.

102
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,810
- They've been fed, they just need a bath.
- I'm on it.

103
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,233
Okay, can you get them to bed
at a reasonable time tonight?

104
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,564
Because, after the party,
they're just exhausted.

105
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,945
Where's the rest of that skirt?

106
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,360
Babe.

107
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,736
Listen, if any guys give you a hassle
in that joint tonight,

108
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,197
you give me a call, okay?

109
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,156
Yeah, just like you gave me a call
when those Temple frat boys

110
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,992
decided to smash up your face.

111
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,248
I told you, most nights,
I sit on the stool and grade papers,

112
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,422
but, every now and then,
I need some action.

113
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:27,428
All right. Well, wait up for me tonight.
I'll see what I can do about that.

114
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,171
Promises, promises.

115
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,724
And we return here on MMA Live,

116
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:41,149
Jon Anik, alongside the billionaire
Fighting promoter, J.J. Riley,

117
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:43,272
the Tapout crew is here,
Punk and Skrape are in the building.

118
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,270
Now, J-J-, what led to this project

119
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,822
that is really rede17ning
mixed martial arts here in the States?

120
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,363
Well, mixed martial arts is a sport
I've been incredibly passionate about,

121
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,116
and as far as where
the idea for Sparta came from,

122
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,995
I've always really dug the Grand Prix format,
so I tracked these guys down.

123
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,244
And when J.J. came to us,
he said he wanted to create

124
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,873
the Super Bowl of mixed martial arts.

125
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:05,040
And he decided to put up
the $5 million purse, too.

126
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:09,090
Well, there you have it, it shall be done.
Hedge fund king, J. J. Riley,

127
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,718
going from the lions' den of Wall Street
to the cage,

128
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:16,472
and promoting the biggest winner-take-all
tournament in MMA history. Sparta-..

129
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:17,598
Doing good. One more time.

130
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,725
Fitzy still own this?

131
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:23,058
I don't know no Fitzy.
Colt Boyd owns this gym.

132
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,811
Can I help you with something?

133
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,402
How does it work?

134
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,400
Thirty-five a month with locker.

135
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,653
We're open at 7:00, lights out at 11:00.

136
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,164
So you want to join?

137
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:39,741
Sure.

138
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:44,538
Put your name and contact info on the card.

139
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,673
Thank you.

140
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:01,684
All right. There's a lesson in this, too, okay?

141
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,021
Hold on, Tito.

142
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,314
So, we have a body at rest,

143
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,893
and you have the bat which needs...

144
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,853
- Acceleration.
- Acceleration, okay.

145
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,273
If you have enough acceleration,

146
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,949
you might have a chance
of breaking the body at rest.

147
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,654
- Okay. All right. You ready?
- Piece of cake.

148
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,328
Everybody got the glasses on? Okay, go!
Piece of cake!

149
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,867
Come on, man!

150
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:21,707
Come on, son!

151
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:27,623
All right! All right. There we go.
Well done, Tito. Well done.

152
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,633
Remind me not to mess with you.

153
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,675
Sit down, everybody. Dial it down.

154
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,048
So, have we got it?

155
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,764
Force equals mass times acceleration,
we got it.

156
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,310
All right. Has everybody else got it?

157
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,476
- Yeah.
- Yes? Okay, good. All right.

158
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,306
The third law...

159
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,483
How many laws this dude got?

160
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,398
- The dude?
- Yes, the dude.

161
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,354
The dude has three, all right?

162
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:55,321
Newton, the dude, says that
for every action,

163
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,324
there is an equal and opposite reaction.

164
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,748
For example,

165
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:05,999
if K.C. does not stop the action
of sending texts in class

166
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,788
and tell her posse outside to beat it,

167
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,626
then my reaction might be
to send her down to Principal Zito's office.

168
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:16,009
Thus setting the world back
in proper balance.

169
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,346
Mr. C, I put it away.

170
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:23,850
All right, before you go,
I have your tests from last week.

171
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,806
Just work it out.

172
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,474
Stop downing.

173
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:30,731
Pick up the hands.

174
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,527
Tighten it up!

175
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,576
Use your right.

176
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,195
Seal his hands, come on.

177
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,952
Seal his hands. Keep your hands up!

178
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:45,996
Go light!

179
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,045
I said, go light!

180
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,126
God damn it!

181
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,170
Where do you find these girls?

182
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,175
We got a tournament coming up,
you're gonna play every guy in the 'Burgh?

183
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,264
Oh, jeez.

184
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,353
Fenroy, get me some ice.

185
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,140
And call that Puerto Rican kid,
the one that fights out of the bottoms.

186
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:12,147
If he's here in 20 minutes,
he gets 200 bucks.

187
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,853
Yo, I'll fight him.

188
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,563
Do me a favor, guy, go back to your bag.

189
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,899
We don't need anybody else getting hurt.
Take a walk.

190
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,405
Let's go. Watch his neck.

191
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:22,699
Yo, Rock, what did you do,

192
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,497
did you leave Mick and Paulie
at home today?

193
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:30,953
His phone's disconnected.

194
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,756
Then go through the list.
Find me somebody. Get me Joe Bones.

195
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:37,301
All I'm saying is
that if you need somebody to help you,

196
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:41,093
I'm happy to keep your boy warm for you.

197
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,685
You ever fought before?

198
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:54,769
Yeah.

199
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,608
Hey, this guy signed a waiver?

200
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,739
All good.

201
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,074
- What's your name?
- Tommy.

202
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:11,753
- You get tuned up in here, it's on you, Tom.
- Sure, no problem. No problem.

203
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,290
Come on in.

204
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,262
Let's go. All right, let's go.

205
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,306
Hey. Watch that teeth.

206
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,514
Are you gonna be a hero? All right.

207
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:37,813
Come on. Check that kick.

208
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,272
Easy.

209
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,987
Come on, Dog, you can do it.
Let's go, come on.

210
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,828
- Good jab. Good jab!
- There we go!

211
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:55,163
No, he won't. Don't let him take your back.
Don't let him take your back!

212
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:56,247
- Dog, get up.
- Get up!

213
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,258
Cover up, cover up!

214
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,841
Don't give him your back.
Don't give him your back!

215
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,182
- Cover up!
- Come on, Dog!

216
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,136
Cover up, damn it!

217
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,743
You owe me 200 bucks.

218
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,097
This one here.
See, this is the new appraisal figures

219
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,268
- that came in.
- Yeah.

220
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,517
And this is how it affects the monthly,
it turns into that.

221
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,475
And the total value of the loan,
over the life of the loan, is that.

222
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,809
As you can see, that's just the way it is.

223
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,519
It puts you upside down,
that's the problem.

224
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,775
It's the county that did the assessment,
not the bank.

225
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,232
So, the numbers are what they are,
Mr. Conlon...

226
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,409
- Brendan.
- The numbers are what they are, Brendan.

227
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,494
I mean, you're a math teacher, right?
You can appreciate that.

228
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,288
I'm a physics teacher. I teach physics.

229
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,909
Physics, okay. But the bank has got to go
by the new appraisal figures.

230
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,666
And, according to these figures,
you're upside down on your mortgage,

231
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,418
- you understand?
- God, you said that like three times.

232
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:21,458
I'm sorry, but I get that.

233
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,841
I am asking you,
is there something else you can do?

234
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:28,431
Not the bank, you.
Can you shift things around, restructure?

235
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,008
You refinanced twice already.

236
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,764
'Cause you advised us to do that.

237
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,228
- You told me.
- Well, I presented you with that option,

238
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,600
but that was your choice.

239
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:40,481
I'm also showing that you netted
a substantial payout with the refi.

240
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,895
We had that conversation.

241
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,316
I was paying medical bills.

242
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,369
Oh, right. Sorry. Your daughter's kidney?

243
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,285
- Heart.
- Heart. Right, sorry.

244
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,746
A lot of stories.

245
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,871
All right, so, if that's my option,
I have no options.

246
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,207
You're not even gonna try and help me.
You're not even gonna try.

247
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,089
No, I'm trying. Look, Brendan,
I can get you 90 days to get even.

248
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,215
Ninety days is not enough.

249
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,969
My wife and I,
we have three jobs between us.

250
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,677
And that doesn't cut it.

251
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,313
So, what do you suggest?

252
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:20,976
Well, let me ask you a question?
Have you thought about bankruptcy?

253
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,152
It's a viable option.

254
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,152
There's no shame in this these days.

255
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,616
That's not how I do things.

256
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:37,834
Okay, well, then
you're looking at foreclosure.

257
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,676
Utter domination by Tommy Conlon,
the undefeated freshman from Pittsburgh.

258
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:54,305
The prodigy has yet to yield a single point
in the entire tournament.

259
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,602
Tommy, trained by his father
since the age of Eve.

260
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,521
- Talking about Paddy Conlon?
- The controversial Paddy Conlon.

261
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,229
Say what you will about the methods
of the former Marine,

262
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,027
but he's led his son
to six straight Junior Olympic titles

263
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,855
and now just moments away
from a High School State Championship.

264
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,111
And there it is! Wow!

265
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,118
There's just no limit
to what the future holds for this kid.

266
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,788
Tommy told me that he's chasing
the record of Theogenes,

267
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:19,618
apparently, a mythical Greek fighter
said to be undefeated in over 1,400 bouts.

268
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,793
Hi, how're you doing, sir?
I'm looking for Tommy Riordan.

269
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,504
- Who?
- Tommy Riordan.

270
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,465
My name is Colt Boyd.

271
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,388
What business you got with Tommy?

272
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:36,593
Well, none yet, that's why I'm here.
I manage fighters.

273
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,601
So, Tommy's been working out at my gym,

274
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:47,563
and he put a beating on the number one
middleweight contender in the world today.

275
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,987
So, I want to know
a little bit more about the guy.

276
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,988
Maybe help him out.

277
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,535
I have a lot of contacts, Mr. Riordan.

278
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,118
Conlon. The name is Conlon.

279
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,830
And anything you wanna know
about Tommy,

280
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,627
you gotta ask him yourself.

281
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,746
Look, I'm just asking
for some general information here.

282
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,299
Like I said, anything you wanna know
about Tommy,

283
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,921
you gotta ask him yourself.

284
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,677
Look, I don't mean
to interrupt your night, okay?

285
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,096
He just put this address down
when he signed up at the gym.

286
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,094
He doesn't live here.

287
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,428
- All right, then.
- Okay. Good night.

288
00:20:28,573 --> 00:20:32,544
All right, listen, kiddo.
I need you to put Mommy back on, okay?

289
00:20:33,035 --> 00:20:34,753
I love you.

290
00:20:35,037 --> 00:20:37,916
Hey. Hey, listen, I'm just pulling in,
I'm gonna have to go.

291
00:20:40,543 --> 00:20:44,548
No, they got an open mic night thing on,
it's gonna be a quiet one.

292
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:48,097
All right, sleep well.

293
00:20:48,176 --> 00:20:49,644
You, too. All right, bye.

294
00:20:55,141 --> 00:20:57,769
It's about time for your next contest.

295
00:20:58,102 --> 00:21:03,199
Introducing first, in the red corner,
he fights out of Ripley, West Virginia.

296
00:21:03,274 --> 00:21:08,075
Please welcome Mike "The Mutilator" Moore.

297
00:21:08,237 --> 00:21:09,238
Say, "Uncle!"

298
00:21:09,488 --> 00:21:10,831
Go, Mike. Go!

299
00:21:14,452 --> 00:21:20,004
And his opponent in the blue corner,
he fights out of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

300
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:24,467
Please welcome "Irish" Brendan Conlon.

301
00:21:28,591 --> 00:21:32,061
This bout is scheduled
for three, five-minute rounds,

302
00:21:32,178 --> 00:21:36,024
and when the action begins,
your referee is Mr Rick Fike.

303
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,647
Fighters to the center

304
00:21:41,312 --> 00:21:42,404
Come on, gentlemen.

305
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,574
I want you to obey my commands
at all times.

306
00:21:44,649 --> 00:21:46,777
I want you to protect yourselves at all times.

307
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:49,203
If you have no questions,
touch gloves, back up.

308
00:21:49,278 --> 00:21:51,781
And on my signal, let's come out fighting.

309
00:21:58,371 --> 00:21:59,748
Fighter, are you ready?

310
00:21:59,997 --> 00:22:01,169
Are you ready?

311
00:22:01,332 --> 00:22:02,424
Do it!

312
00:22:12,426 --> 00:22:13,848
Come on, Mike, let's go!

313
00:22:25,064 --> 00:22:26,486
You gotta move with that one.

314
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:44,709
Come on, Mike!

315
00:22:55,094 --> 00:22:57,222
Don't let him do that to you, Mike!

316
00:23:01,934 --> 00:23:02,935
Get up, Mike, get up!

317
00:23:20,453 --> 00:23:22,706
- First five minutes, out.
- Another 15? Great.

318
00:23:24,874 --> 00:23:26,751
Hey! Hey, kid!

319
00:23:27,168 --> 00:23:30,422
Nice fight.
Two more wins, you take home the bacon.

320
00:23:30,588 --> 00:23:31,805
Hey, good job...

321
00:23:46,354 --> 00:23:47,697
Hey, babe.

322
00:23:47,938 --> 00:23:49,030
Hey.

323
00:24:18,177 --> 00:24:19,975
How was work?

324
00:24:24,517 --> 00:24:26,064
Oh, my God!

325
00:24:29,313 --> 00:24:30,815
What happened?

326
00:24:31,315 --> 00:24:33,943
You said it was gonna be a slow night.

327
00:24:36,654 --> 00:24:38,873
I'm not bouncing at a club.

328
00:24:41,409 --> 00:24:44,003
What do you mean you're not bouncing?

329
00:25:02,388 --> 00:25:04,186
You've been lying to me?

330
00:25:07,977 --> 00:25:10,025
I went in to apply

331
00:25:13,607 --> 00:25:16,360
and they were paying nine bucks an hour.

332
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:24,790
Then I saw a sign for this other thing.

333
00:25:32,334 --> 00:25:33,802
They're putting us out of the house
in three months.

334
00:25:33,878 --> 00:25:34,970
We're running out of options.

335
00:25:35,045 --> 00:25:36,718
Then they put us out of the house
in three months.

336
00:25:37,006 --> 00:25:38,553
I'd rather go back to the old apartment

337
00:25:38,632 --> 00:25:41,727
than see you in the back
of an ambulance again.

338
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,893
I thought we agreed
that we weren't gonna raise our children

339
00:25:44,972 --> 00:25:48,567
in a family where their father
gets beat up for a living.

340
00:25:52,521 --> 00:25:55,070
We're not giving up the house.

341
00:25:55,232 --> 00:25:56,984
It's our home.

342
00:25:58,235 --> 00:25:59,953
We're not going backwards.

343
00:26:13,042 --> 00:26:14,794
We'll figure it Out.

344
00:26:17,254 --> 00:26:19,882
This is what we're not going back to.

345
00:27:17,648 --> 00:27:19,650
You wanted to talk?

346
00:27:21,443 --> 00:27:22,535
Yeah.

347
00:27:25,072 --> 00:27:27,074
I'm gonna start fighting.

348
00:27:27,908 --> 00:27:28,955
Is that right?

349
00:27:29,034 --> 00:27:30,081
Don't play babe in the woods with me.

350
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,504
I know that guy from the gym
came to see you.

351
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,082
Colt Boyd.

352
00:27:34,373 --> 00:27:37,297
Yeah. I didn't tell him anything, Tommy.

353
00:27:37,668 --> 00:27:40,797
I wouldn't be sitting here
with you now if you did.

354
00:27:40,879 --> 00:27:43,177
- Paddy, can I get you more coffee?
- No. Thank you. I'm fine.

355
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,264
- Hon, would you like a cup of coffee? Okay.
- Sure. Thank you.

356
00:27:48,637 --> 00:27:50,389
All right.

357
00:27:50,598 --> 00:27:52,566
There's this tournament,

358
00:27:52,725 --> 00:27:54,227
it's a big tournament.

359
00:27:55,436 --> 00:27:58,610
Top 16 middleweights in the world.
Single elimination.

360
00:27:58,689 --> 00:28:01,488
Winner takes all. It's a lot of money.

361
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,953
- Okay.
- I'm gonna do that.

362
00:28:07,197 --> 00:28:08,915
But if I'm doing it,

363
00:28:12,328 --> 00:28:15,047
then I'm gonna need a trainer.

364
00:28:15,748 --> 00:28:17,876
Now, that much, you were good at.

365
00:28:20,127 --> 00:28:21,424
What?

366
00:28:21,587 --> 00:28:24,557
No, no, no.
This doesn't mean anything, okay?

367
00:28:25,132 --> 00:28:26,725
I'm serious.

368
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:28,852
We train. That's it.

369
00:28:28,927 --> 00:28:31,476
I don't want to hear a word
about anything but training.

370
00:28:31,555 --> 00:28:33,102
You understand?

371
00:28:33,557 --> 00:28:37,107
You want to tell your war stories,
you can take them down to the VFW.

372
00:28:37,227 --> 00:28:40,572
Or you can take it to a meeting, or to church,

373
00:28:40,648 --> 00:28:43,071
or whatever the hell it is
that you do nowadays.

374
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,868
What about Colt Boyd?

375
00:28:44,943 --> 00:28:47,446
What about him? I told him
I don't train with people that I don't know.

376
00:28:47,529 --> 00:28:49,952
- The devil you know.
- Excuse me?

377
00:28:50,407 --> 00:28:54,082
The devil you know
is better than the devil you don't.

378
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,753
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

379
00:28:59,249 --> 00:29:01,047
There's your coffee, hon.

380
00:29:01,752 --> 00:29:02,969
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

381
00:29:03,504 --> 00:29:07,600
Chasing Theogenes.
It'll be kind of like the old times.

382
00:29:08,592 --> 00:29:11,345
I just told you, this doesn't mean anything.

383
00:29:12,388 --> 00:29:15,232
Now, get that through your skull right now
or I'm walking.

384
00:29:15,307 --> 00:29:17,150
All right. All right.

385
00:29:17,434 --> 00:29:19,857
But you get something
through your skull, too.

386
00:29:19,937 --> 00:29:24,113
You called me, so don't go
threatening to walk every five minutes.

387
00:29:26,068 --> 00:29:28,287
And since this is about training,

388
00:29:28,612 --> 00:29:32,242
you dump whatever it is you need to dump
as far as those pills are concerned.

389
00:29:32,324 --> 00:29:34,247
I don't wanna see them.

390
00:29:34,993 --> 00:29:37,462
In fact, hand them over right now.

391
00:29:39,998 --> 00:29:41,375
I know they're on you, Tommy.

392
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:45,213
You sounded like a goddamn maraca
coming through the door.

393
00:29:57,141 --> 00:29:58,893
That's not gonna do.

394
00:30:01,103 --> 00:30:04,653
When you came through that door, it was...

395
00:30:07,443 --> 00:30:08,615
Three.

396
00:30:15,451 --> 00:30:16,703
That'a boy.

397
00:30:18,412 --> 00:30:21,086
And another thing.
You don't eat crap like this.

398
00:30:21,165 --> 00:30:23,338
This is for losers and old men.

399
00:30:25,461 --> 00:30:27,088
And we're gonna have to bunk up.

400
00:30:27,171 --> 00:30:29,424
If we're gonna do this right,
you're gonna stay at the house.

401
00:30:30,174 --> 00:30:33,178
I watch your diet.
We follow the old regimen.

402
00:30:34,803 --> 00:30:36,055
You copy?

403
00:30:38,682 --> 00:30:39,683
All right.

404
00:30:41,185 --> 00:30:42,528
COPY...

405
00:30:56,867 --> 00:30:57,868
Your brother's a liar.

406
00:30:57,951 --> 00:30:59,453
- ...Went in the middle of the night...
- Yeah.

407
00:30:59,536 --> 00:31:02,039
And he went to a strip club,
and he said he saw Mr. C...

408
00:31:02,122 --> 00:31:03,339
- No way.
- Front and center.

409
00:31:03,415 --> 00:31:05,713
- Like MMA type stuff.
- You weren't there, so you don't know.

410
00:31:05,793 --> 00:31:06,794
What's MMA?

411
00:31:06,877 --> 00:31:07,844
- Mixed martial arts.
- Like, fighting.

412
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,297
Like, different styles of fighting.

413
00:31:09,379 --> 00:31:11,723
He was just, like,
dropped him on the floor...

414
00:31:17,054 --> 00:31:18,101
It's true?

415
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,103
Take your seats.

416
00:31:20,182 --> 00:31:21,525
Now, please.

417
00:31:32,945 --> 00:31:34,788
Hey, yo, Mr. C.

418
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,282
Hey, my brother was at the titty bar
last night,

419
00:31:37,366 --> 00:31:40,916
and he said you was choking brothers out.
I mean, what's up, is it true?

420
00:31:41,078 --> 00:31:43,080
Yeah, Mr. C. I mean, like, is it true?

421
00:31:43,163 --> 00:31:45,006
Did you really work on some fools
or something?

422
00:31:45,082 --> 00:31:47,005
- You have to tell us.
- Yeah.

423
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:01,349
All right.
I want examples of forms of energy.

424
00:32:21,618 --> 00:32:23,541
Come on. It's not as bad as it looks.

425
00:32:24,246 --> 00:32:28,717
Are you being literal or figurative?
Because, literally, it looks bad.

426
00:32:28,792 --> 00:32:32,262
And figuratively, it looks even worse.

427
00:32:32,379 --> 00:32:34,552
The superintendent's coming by.
Few minutes.

428
00:32:37,509 --> 00:32:38,510
Oh, man.

429
00:32:39,261 --> 00:32:41,810
So, come on, Brendan.
Give me a little help here.

430
00:32:42,055 --> 00:32:46,310
I mean, could you explain to me
what the hell you were doing?

431
00:32:51,273 --> 00:32:52,650
I need the money, Joe.

432
00:32:53,567 --> 00:32:55,410
Yeah, but this is...

433
00:32:55,527 --> 00:32:57,200
We can't have this.

434
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,624
This isn't moonlighting at Applebee's,
for Christ's sake.

435
00:33:01,491 --> 00:33:03,585
Shit, Brendan.

436
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,584
Leaving everything else aside,
which we can't,

437
00:33:06,663 --> 00:33:08,506
are you out of your mind?

438
00:33:08,665 --> 00:33:10,759
You're gonna get yourself killed.

439
00:33:10,834 --> 00:33:12,427
I mean, you're a goddamn teacher.

440
00:33:12,502 --> 00:33:15,005
You got no business in the ring
with those animals.

441
00:33:16,924 --> 00:33:19,598
Actually, I used to be one of those animals.

442
00:33:22,638 --> 00:33:24,640
I fought for a living.

443
00:33:26,308 --> 00:33:29,232
Guess I forgot to put that down
on my application.

444
00:33:30,979 --> 00:33:33,027
Yeah, I guess you did.

445
00:33:33,649 --> 00:33:35,492
Look, I'm sorry, Joe. It's just...

446
00:33:35,567 --> 00:33:38,411
Look, look,
the school district is not gonna tolerate

447
00:33:38,487 --> 00:33:40,581
teachers cockfighting in strip clubs.

448
00:33:40,697 --> 00:33:43,291
It was a parking lot of a strip club.

449
00:33:43,367 --> 00:33:45,745
Wherever it was, you can't be doing it.

450
00:33:46,036 --> 00:33:50,758
All right? I mean, this is a serious...
Shit, he's here.

451
00:33:50,832 --> 00:33:53,210
This is a serious problem.

452
00:33:57,673 --> 00:34:00,768
Guy hasn't been inside a school since 9/11.

453
00:34:03,387 --> 00:34:05,389
What are we gonna do?

454
00:34:06,306 --> 00:34:09,480
You say, "Yes, sir," and you say, "No, sir,"

455
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:12,529
and you say,
"It will never happen again, sir."

456
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:16,951
And then we just pray to God
that he's in a good mood.

457
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,287
UFC?

458
00:34:26,576 --> 00:34:28,078
Yeah.

459
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:30,793
Son of a bitch.

460
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:35,427
- Superintendent Yorn. Good to see you, sir.
- Principal Zito.

461
00:34:53,937 --> 00:34:55,530
What are you doing?

462
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,489
Well,

463
00:34:59,568 --> 00:35:02,947
the girls have an important piano recital
in the morning.

464
00:35:04,114 --> 00:35:06,833
And we have an equipment malfunction.

465
00:35:11,121 --> 00:35:12,589
How'd it go?

466
00:35:13,165 --> 00:35:17,545
They're gonna review your case
at the end of the semester.

467
00:35:17,627 --> 00:35:22,133
But until then,
you're suspended without pay.

468
00:35:28,722 --> 00:35:31,475
Joe gave me the number of his attorney.

469
00:35:33,185 --> 00:35:35,187
How the hell are we gonna pay
for an attorney?

470
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:38,444
He talked to me for free as a favor to Joe.

471
00:35:38,523 --> 00:35:40,742
That's nice.

472
00:35:40,817 --> 00:35:42,490
He said there's no precedent for this.

473
00:35:43,236 --> 00:35:45,739
You'll be back by next semester.

474
00:35:45,822 --> 00:35:47,824
The next semester?

475
00:35:58,168 --> 00:35:59,590
Tess,

476
00:36:01,171 --> 00:36:03,845
they have these smoker fights all over.

477
00:36:05,342 --> 00:36:09,813
There's one in Lancaster next week,
there's two in Dover the week after.

478
00:36:09,888 --> 00:36:13,017
Wilmington, Camden, Baltimore.

479
00:36:17,145 --> 00:36:19,864
That could keep us afloat.

480
00:36:20,482 --> 00:36:25,158
You're gonna put yourself through this
over and over for 500 bucks a pop?

481
00:36:28,031 --> 00:36:30,409
Some of them pay a lot more than that.

482
00:36:33,203 --> 00:36:37,299
I would have to bounce for a month
to make what I made in two hours last night.

483
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,218
Yeah.

484
00:36:42,796 --> 00:36:45,345
And these guys, they're not real fighters.

485
00:36:46,675 --> 00:36:49,975
They're just guys that have seen
too much UFC on TV.

486
00:36:56,143 --> 00:36:59,522
Now, if you have a better solution,

487
00:36:59,604 --> 00:37:01,902
I'm all ears, but...

488
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:07,363
And what are we gonna tell the girls?

489
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,499
It'll be fine.

490
00:37:10,574 --> 00:37:13,168
I'll just leave the house as usual,

491
00:37:13,243 --> 00:37:16,292
except, only this time,
I'll be going to the gym.

492
00:37:28,925 --> 00:37:31,929
The duck goes
quack, quack, quack, quack

493
00:37:32,971 --> 00:37:36,817
And the cow goes
moo, moo, moo!

494
00:37:36,933 --> 00:37:42,064
But that rooster
That rooster, he knew everything

495
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:47,699
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

496
00:37:47,777 --> 00:37:50,576
Let's go, kiddo. Let's get moving.

497
00:37:52,449 --> 00:37:54,122
Look what I found

498
00:37:54,451 --> 00:37:56,829
in that disaster of a...

499
00:37:58,788 --> 00:38:00,210
basement

500
00:38:01,666 --> 00:38:04,670
What do you say we sit down

501
00:38:06,171 --> 00:38:07,889
and update this?

502
00:38:09,299 --> 00:38:13,429
And you can fill me in
on how close you got to that record.

503
00:38:16,848 --> 00:38:21,274
Did you continue wrestling
after you left with your mother?

504
00:38:25,899 --> 00:38:28,072
Come on, Tommy. Tell me something.

505
00:38:30,612 --> 00:38:32,159
Yeah, I'll tell you something.

506
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:36,869
You can take that back
to where you found it,

507
00:38:36,952 --> 00:38:39,421
you can leave the coffee in the pot.

508
00:38:39,496 --> 00:38:42,295
I can pour that myself.

509
00:38:42,374 --> 00:38:44,843
And I can wake myself up, too.

510
00:38:56,846 --> 00:38:58,894
Hurt my knees
coming up and down those stairs.

511
00:38:58,974 --> 00:39:00,442
Yeah?

512
00:39:00,517 --> 00:39:05,068
I'll leave the coffee pot on until 0500,
then I dump it.

513
00:39:11,861 --> 00:39:15,161
I give command dismiss.
You'll wash your nasty bodies.

514
00:39:16,533 --> 00:39:18,956
You can square your gear away.

515
00:39:19,035 --> 00:39:21,754
Corporal Bradford, take this to CSC,
let them know we're back.

516
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:23,252
Roger, sir.

517
00:39:24,082 --> 00:39:26,460
Detail, a-ten-hut!

518
00:39:27,002 --> 00:39:29,425
7-3-4, this is Gealer Base.
Sitrep, over.

519
00:39:31,423 --> 00:39:33,642
What's up, Mark?

520
00:39:33,717 --> 00:39:36,311
Here, sir. William's Company's back in.

521
00:39:36,386 --> 00:39:38,434
Damn, dude! That's brutal.

522
00:39:38,513 --> 00:39:40,186
- Did you see that? Oh, my God.
- What?

523
00:39:40,265 --> 00:39:41,357
What's that?

524
00:39:41,433 --> 00:39:45,154
Dude, Mad Dog Grimes is getting tuned up
by some dude at a gym in Pittsburgh.

525
00:39:45,228 --> 00:39:46,696
Who is Mad Dog Grimes?

526
00:39:46,771 --> 00:39:49,240
Shit, Bradford,
the stuff you don't know amazes me.

527
00:39:49,441 --> 00:39:52,069
- Dude. Oh, my God, did you see that?
- Wow. Oh, my God.

528
00:39:52,152 --> 00:39:54,530
- Wait. Rewind that.
- Okay.

529
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,538
Right there, pause, pause, pause.

530
00:40:02,704 --> 00:40:04,126
What's up, man?

531
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:08,335
Dude, what's his deal?

532
00:40:14,007 --> 00:40:15,259
You're not gonna get your 11.

533
00:40:15,967 --> 00:40:18,436
- AV, I need to see the tape.
- What tape?

534
00:40:18,845 --> 00:40:20,438
- What tape?
- The tape!

535
00:40:23,767 --> 00:40:25,769
Hoolihan, fill in for me?

536
00:40:26,186 --> 00:40:27,187
Get the camera.

537
00:41:02,972 --> 00:41:04,394
That's him.

538
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:08,653
That's him.

539
00:41:10,647 --> 00:41:13,526
Let the music sink into you.
This is Beethoven.

540
00:41:13,608 --> 00:41:17,112
I want you to breathe. I don't want
you boxing like this. No more stiff, right?

541
00:41:17,195 --> 00:41:20,199
You listen to the music.
You relax, you breathe. One, two...

542
00:41:24,619 --> 00:41:27,919
Again. One, two. One, two. One, two.

543
00:41:33,169 --> 00:41:34,170
Good.

544
00:41:34,504 --> 00:41:36,677
Good, good, good. Yos.

545
00:41:38,174 --> 00:41:41,428
You're gonna get it, you're gonna get it.
All right? Two more rounds.

546
00:41:47,517 --> 00:41:48,814
Do I know you?

547
00:41:51,479 --> 00:41:52,526
- Oh, man!
- Wow.

548
00:41:52,605 --> 00:41:55,449
- Long time, brother. Too long.
- How you doing?

549
00:41:55,525 --> 00:41:56,822
- Too long.
- Look at your place.

550
00:41:56,901 --> 00:41:57,902
- You like?
- Yeah.

551
00:41:58,486 --> 00:42:01,831
You see this beast? Marco Santos.

552
00:42:01,906 --> 00:42:03,783
- He's training for Sparta.
- Yeah, right.

553
00:42:03,867 --> 00:42:05,244
Not bad, right?

554
00:42:05,326 --> 00:42:07,044
It's amazing, man.

555
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:10,920
Only the best. Move! Move! Move!
Move or die!

556
00:42:12,542 --> 00:42:14,715
- You look good, brother.
- Thanks.

557
00:42:18,965 --> 00:42:21,138
How are the girls?

558
00:42:21,217 --> 00:42:24,061
Good. Yeah. I had another little one, Rosie.

559
00:42:24,137 --> 00:42:28,142
I know. I know because Johnny C. told me
that she was in the hospital for a bit.

560
00:42:28,224 --> 00:42:29,521
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

561
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,687
You know,

562
00:42:35,106 --> 00:42:37,655
I was gonna call you
and then time went by and...

563
00:42:37,734 --> 00:42:39,577
I'm a piece of shit. I should've called you.
I'm sorry.

564
00:42:39,652 --> 00:42:40,653
- No. Come on.
- No.

565
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:44,324
Brendan, I'm sorry.

566
00:42:45,033 --> 00:42:47,286
It's all good. She's good now.

567
00:42:47,368 --> 00:42:49,336
- She's okay?
- So beautiful.

568
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:58,180
It's good to see you, man.
So everything's going great, huh?

569
00:42:58,254 --> 00:42:59,676
Yeah.

570
00:43:00,632 --> 00:43:04,136
Well, I've got a little problem.

571
00:43:06,804 --> 00:43:09,182
The guys at the bank
want to take my house away.

572
00:43:09,265 --> 00:43:11,017
- What?
- Yeah.

573
00:43:11,768 --> 00:43:14,612
That's kind of why
I came to see you, actually.

574
00:43:18,983 --> 00:43:22,453
You know, I got most of my dough
tied up in this joint,

575
00:43:22,529 --> 00:43:23,701
but how much do you need?

576
00:43:23,821 --> 00:43:25,619
I didn't come here for a loan, Frank.

577
00:43:26,616 --> 00:43:28,459
I mean, I was hoping that

578
00:43:30,828 --> 00:43:32,922
you would train me.

579
00:43:33,706 --> 00:43:34,707
Train you for what?

580
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:37,127
I wanna get back in the cage.

581
00:43:38,461 --> 00:43:39,462
Are you serious?

582
00:43:42,799 --> 00:43:44,221
Come on, Brendan.

583
00:43:44,509 --> 00:43:46,136
I won an event the other night.

584
00:43:46,844 --> 00:43:50,269
You won an event. That's what this is.

585
00:43:50,348 --> 00:43:54,023
Let me guess. It was in a parking lot?
DJ from a local radio station,

586
00:43:54,102 --> 00:43:57,606
a couple of ring card girls
you wouldn't bang on a dare? Am I right?

587
00:43:59,482 --> 00:44:01,200
- Ish.
- Ish.

588
00:44:02,235 --> 00:44:04,658
Brendan. I love you.

589
00:44:05,405 --> 00:44:07,157
Why am I gonna train you?

590
00:44:08,408 --> 00:44:10,831
When you were on the right side of 30,
you were barely a .500 fighter.

591
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:13,914
You never listened to me.

592
00:44:13,997 --> 00:44:17,376
You don't listen to anyone.
These guys are animals.

593
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:22,555
You're a teacher, right?
What are you gonna do?

594
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:26,180
You're gonna come down here
a couple of days a week after detention?

595
00:44:26,259 --> 00:44:29,854
You're gonna skip out
of the girls' volleyball game early?

596
00:44:30,305 --> 00:44:32,854
I've got loads of time. Time's not an issue.

597
00:44:33,808 --> 00:44:37,108
Parking lot thing kind of got me suspended.

598
00:44:44,068 --> 00:44:46,662
I need to keep working the smokers.

599
00:44:50,491 --> 00:44:52,118
Tess know about this?

600
00:44:52,201 --> 00:44:53,623
Yeah?

601
00:44:53,703 --> 00:44:55,922
'Cause the last time you fought,
I got read the riot act,

602
00:44:55,997 --> 00:44:58,876
sitting in a hospital waiting room.
You remember that?

603
00:44:58,958 --> 00:45:01,086
I was unconscious.

604
00:45:01,169 --> 00:45:05,094
- You were more than unconscious.
- I was.

605
00:45:05,173 --> 00:45:09,519
She's not gonna come down here
with the two puppies, screaming at Frank?

606
00:45:09,594 --> 00:45:13,269
It's not gonna happen.

607
00:45:13,348 --> 00:45:14,395
What do you say, Frank?

608
00:45:16,517 --> 00:45:18,269
What do I say?
What am I gonna say to you? "No"?

609
00:45:19,395 --> 00:45:21,443
I mean, all my time
is wrapped up with Marco.

610
00:45:21,522 --> 00:45:24,571
You know, you come down, I throw you
in a rotation, you spar with these guys.

611
00:45:24,651 --> 00:45:29,248
But I can't promise you
much more than that, Brendan.

612
00:45:29,322 --> 00:45:30,699
That's all I need.

613
00:45:31,032 --> 00:45:33,034
Great. All right.

614
00:45:33,117 --> 00:45:34,585
Yeah.

615
00:45:34,661 --> 00:45:36,709
- I appreciate it.
- What, are you kidding me?

616
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,082
- You need anything, you call me.
- I will.

617
00:45:39,165 --> 00:45:40,508
Let me know when you're coming down.

618
00:45:40,583 --> 00:45:43,132
Well, I'm just gonna get
my stuff from the car.

619
00:45:44,545 --> 00:45:45,546
Now?

620
00:46:11,948 --> 00:46:13,700
Hey, Brendan.

621
00:46:14,033 --> 00:46:17,082
Brendan, it's me, Pop.

622
00:46:22,291 --> 00:46:23,918
What are you doing here?

623
00:46:24,293 --> 00:46:26,136
I have some news for you.

624
00:46:29,632 --> 00:46:32,055
Something wrong with your hands?

625
00:46:32,135 --> 00:46:33,478
- No.
- If there's nothing wrong with your hands,

626
00:46:33,553 --> 00:46:34,930
there's no reason for you not to phone.

627
00:46:35,638 --> 00:46:37,561
- That's the deal.
- Yeah. I forgot.

628
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,688
The phone or mail, Pop. Non negotiable.

629
00:46:39,767 --> 00:46:43,817
Hey, Brendan.
You ever seen my hands so steady?

630
00:46:43,896 --> 00:46:45,489
Ever seen that?

631
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:49,243
I'm going inside.

632
00:46:49,318 --> 00:46:51,662
I got 1,000 days, Brendan.

633
00:46:52,655 --> 00:46:54,157
Thousand days sober, today.

634
00:46:55,742 --> 00:46:57,915
Well, that's great, Pop,
but it doesn't change anything.

635
00:46:57,994 --> 00:46:59,120
What do you mean,
doesn't change anything?

636
00:46:59,662 --> 00:47:01,289
Have a heart, Brendan.

637
00:47:01,706 --> 00:47:03,754
You listen to me.

638
00:47:03,833 --> 00:47:06,882
You take your "have a heart" bullshit
and you run it down the road.

639
00:47:07,879 --> 00:47:10,052
Yeah, run it out with someone
that doesn't know you like I do.

640
00:47:10,131 --> 00:47:14,477
All right, listen to me.
I thought maybe we could break bread.

641
00:47:14,552 --> 00:47:17,772
You know,
just open some lines of communication.

642
00:47:18,181 --> 00:47:23,108
You got two lines of communication.
You got the telephone and the post office.

643
00:47:23,186 --> 00:47:24,608
God! Just 'cause you decide
it's a special day,

644
00:47:24,687 --> 00:47:25,859
it doesn't make it one for me.

645
00:47:25,938 --> 00:47:27,940
I've got a wife and kids inside,
and they're waiting for me,

646
00:47:28,024 --> 00:47:29,697
so I don't have time for whatever this is.

647
00:47:29,776 --> 00:47:33,576
I know you got a wife and kid in there.
I've got a granddaughter in there

648
00:47:33,654 --> 00:47:35,452
I haven't seen in three years.

649
00:47:35,531 --> 00:47:37,283
And another one I haven't even ever met.

650
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:40,374
Yeah. Why is that, Pop?

651
00:47:40,453 --> 00:47:42,376
Why is that?

652
00:47:43,706 --> 00:47:46,505
Do you remember
having anything to do with that?

653
00:47:46,584 --> 00:47:48,507
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

654
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:51,889
That shit you pulled.

655
00:47:53,174 --> 00:47:55,302
Never again.

656
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:57,853
And all that shit I saw growing up,

657
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:01,478
- that doesn't happen here.
- Look...

658
00:48:03,726 --> 00:48:04,898
Take care of yourself.

659
00:48:07,563 --> 00:48:09,190
Tommy's back.

660
00:48:15,655 --> 00:48:17,498
He's in the 'Burgh.

661
00:48:21,869 --> 00:48:23,166
You say Tommy's in Pittsburgh?

662
00:48:23,246 --> 00:48:25,544
Yeah, he came to see me.

663
00:48:27,667 --> 00:48:29,010
He came to see you?

664
00:48:29,752 --> 00:48:32,756
Yeah. He's over at the house.

665
00:48:33,589 --> 00:48:37,810
We're doing a little training at Fitzy's.

666
00:48:37,927 --> 00:48:39,600
You remember Fitzy's?

667
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,556
It ain't Fitzy's any more.

668
00:48:44,225 --> 00:48:45,602
You and Tommy are training together?

669
00:48:46,227 --> 00:48:47,353
Yeah.

670
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:50,364
- Tommy Conlon?
- Riordan.

671
00:48:50,606 --> 00:48:53,450
- He's using your mother's maiden name.
- Yeah, I know what her name is.

672
00:48:53,526 --> 00:48:58,248
Well, I thought you'd wanna know he's back.
So that's why I drove all the way over here.

673
00:48:58,781 --> 00:49:00,374
I thought you came to break bread
over 1,000 days.

674
00:49:00,449 --> 00:49:03,703
No, I did, Brendan, that's most important.

675
00:49:03,786 --> 00:49:05,584
That, too.

676
00:49:08,374 --> 00:49:10,126
All right. Did he say if he wants to see me?

677
00:49:12,044 --> 00:49:13,546
He doesn't say much, Brendan.

678
00:49:19,635 --> 00:49:22,639
He's just not that happy kid he was,
you know?

679
00:49:24,307 --> 00:49:25,900
- Wow. Look at you.
- What?

680
00:49:25,975 --> 00:49:27,147
Mr. Inside Man.

681
00:49:27,643 --> 00:49:29,065
Inside? What?

682
00:49:29,604 --> 00:49:33,199
You and Tommy training together like
nothing ever happened. It's unbelievable.

683
00:49:33,274 --> 00:49:34,992
- Look...
- Now I know what you're really doing here.

684
00:49:35,067 --> 00:49:36,489
- What's that?
- You came to gloat.

685
00:49:36,569 --> 00:49:39,322
I did not come to gloat.
I came to get my son back.

686
00:49:39,405 --> 00:49:41,578
Wow. There you go.
Yeah, you got your son back.

687
00:49:41,657 --> 00:49:44,661
- No, I'm talking about you, Brendan. You.
- You got your son back.

688
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:51,508
You know...

689
00:49:53,502 --> 00:49:55,300
Forget it.

690
00:49:55,504 --> 00:50:01,511
Yeah, I'll tell you. Part of the reason...
Part of the reason I stuck around,

691
00:50:01,594 --> 00:50:03,688
'cause I thought I'd finally get you
all to myself.

692
00:50:07,308 --> 00:50:09,652
But you didn't have any interest
in training me.

693
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:13,155
- You thought Tommy was the one.
- Brendan, I was a drunk.

694
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:16,279
I mean, you know, Brendan, I'm sorry.

695
00:50:16,359 --> 00:50:17,360
Forget it.

696
00:50:18,653 --> 00:50:22,999
You were always a frontrunner.
Never had any interest in the underdogs.

697
00:50:25,534 --> 00:50:28,378
- But I was your son.
- You are my son, Brendan.

698
00:50:28,454 --> 00:50:30,627
- Am I?
- Yeah, you are.

699
00:50:32,083 --> 00:50:35,633
I'm just asking you if you can find...

700
00:50:37,546 --> 00:50:42,803
Find a little bit of space in your heart
to forgive me a little bit.

701
00:50:45,388 --> 00:50:49,143
Yeah? All right, I forgive you.

702
00:50:50,393 --> 00:50:53,192
- Okay.
- But I do not trust you.

703
00:50:55,272 --> 00:50:58,902
Listen, tell Tommy, if he wants to see me,
this is where I am.

704
00:50:59,694 --> 00:51:02,243
- Okay. But they're not different things.
- All right?

705
00:51:02,321 --> 00:51:04,244
You gotta trust to forgive.

706
00:51:04,573 --> 00:51:06,325
Night, Pop.

707
00:51:06,409 --> 00:51:07,535
My God.

708
00:51:08,369 --> 00:51:11,623
Is that Emily? Jeez, she's grown, Brendan.

709
00:51:12,206 --> 00:51:14,504
- Is that Rosie?
- Daddy, who is that?

710
00:51:14,583 --> 00:51:16,927
It's just a nice, old man. Come on. Let's go.

711
00:51:17,003 --> 00:51:18,926
How about a cup of coffee?

712
00:51:35,187 --> 00:51:37,815
Huge news just broken here at ESPN

713
00:51:37,898 --> 00:51:41,994
that Koba is coming to America
and will17ght at Sparta.

714
00:51:42,153 --> 00:51:44,781
Universally considered
the greatest pound-for-pound fighter

715
00:51:44,864 --> 00:51:47,913
who ever lived, the mighty,
mythical Russian has never fought

716
00:51:47,992 --> 00:51:50,245
on US soil in his legendary career

717
00:51:50,453 --> 00:51:53,548
Slow to half guard.
Slow to half guard, hammer fist.

718
00:51:53,622 --> 00:51:58,844
Now start on the other side.
And slip back in, there you go.

719
00:51:58,919 --> 00:52:01,263
Tommy,

720
00:52:01,338 --> 00:52:03,716
I got some news for you.

721
00:52:03,799 --> 00:52:04,846
I got you into Sparta.

722
00:52:05,342 --> 00:52:06,764
It took some doing,

723
00:52:07,303 --> 00:52:08,896
but I made it happen.

724
00:52:12,933 --> 00:52:15,937
You know thank you and 10% is customary?

725
00:52:33,537 --> 00:52:36,211
Pilar? Hey, it's Tommy.

726
00:52:36,373 --> 00:52:38,501
Tommy?

727
00:52:44,256 --> 00:52:46,384
Okay. Sorry.

728
00:52:47,343 --> 00:52:50,847
Good. I'm good. How are you doing?

729
00:52:51,889 --> 00:52:55,109
Okay. You know me, Tommy.

730
00:52:55,184 --> 00:52:57,607
I was getting really worried about you.

731
00:52:58,687 --> 00:53:02,032
How's things? How are the kids?
The kids good?

732
00:53:02,108 --> 00:53:03,360
Yeah, they're good.

733
00:53:03,859 --> 00:53:06,408
- Maria's getting so big.
- Yeah?

734
00:53:07,404 --> 00:53:10,203
She looks more and more like Manny
every day.

735
00:53:11,283 --> 00:53:15,709
- How's little man?
- He's good. He's a good kid, Tommy.

736
00:53:15,788 --> 00:53:19,588
He's a real good boy.
He takes care of his sister.

737
00:53:19,667 --> 00:53:21,965
- He's a great kid. Everyone's good.
- Good.

738
00:53:22,044 --> 00:53:23,887
- We're good.
- Good.

739
00:53:26,132 --> 00:53:27,554
You know...

740
00:53:28,425 --> 00:53:32,601
Pilar, I haven't forgotten for one minute

741
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,809
what I promised you.

742
00:53:37,476 --> 00:53:41,276
What I promised Manny.
I got opportunities coming up, so...

743
00:53:41,355 --> 00:53:42,823
Whatever you can do, Tommy.

744
00:53:42,898 --> 00:53:45,492
Help you guys out.
I'm gonna take care of you guys.

745
00:53:45,568 --> 00:53:48,947
I know. Manny would really appreciate it.

746
00:53:49,405 --> 00:53:51,578
- I wanna help you.
- You know what? You worry too much.

747
00:53:51,657 --> 00:53:54,831
You worry so much about us. It's okay.

748
00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:57,208
You know what? We're hanging in there.

749
00:53:57,288 --> 00:54:01,168
”Captain Pollard once more sailed
for the Pacific in command of another ship,

750
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:05,471
”but the gods shipwrecked him again
upon unknown rocks and breakers.

751
00:54:05,546 --> 00:54:08,800
”For the second time,
his ship was utterly lost,

752
00:54:08,883 --> 00:54:12,228
”and forthwith forswearing the sea,
he has never tempted it since. ”

753
00:54:13,095 --> 00:54:16,190
Stop for a second. Listen to the music.
This is Beethoven.

754
00:54:17,558 --> 00:54:20,357
Could you do another thing?
Or are you gonna do the same thing?

755
00:54:20,436 --> 00:54:23,986
I need you to relax and listen.
Forget about how to lose the fight.

756
00:54:24,064 --> 00:54:26,112
And two, and three.

757
00:54:26,275 --> 00:54:27,822
With eight weeks left to Sparta,

758
00:54:27,902 --> 00:54:29,700
J.J. Riley and the Tapout crew

759
00:54:29,778 --> 00:54:32,702
take time out from their international
press tour to join us.

760
00:54:32,781 --> 00:54:35,455
J. J., we've never seen
this kind of Grand Prix tournament

761
00:54:35,534 --> 00:54:38,538
in this country before.
Tell us, why the unique format?

762
00:54:38,954 --> 00:54:42,549
Well, look, Jon, you know as well as anyone
that in mixed martial arts,

763
00:54:42,625 --> 00:54:44,844
anyone can beat anyone on a given night.

764
00:54:44,919 --> 00:54:46,671
But with this type of format,

765
00:54:46,795 --> 00:54:49,389
it's gonna be tough
to deny who the champion is.

766
00:54:49,465 --> 00:54:54,437
You got four fights in two nights,
16 fighters down to one,

767
00:54:54,511 --> 00:54:56,229
winner's gonna be the last man standing.

768
00:54:56,305 --> 00:54:58,273
Thirty-one. Thirty-two!

769
00:54:59,725 --> 00:55:01,944
Breathe, breathe. Keep your eyes open.

770
00:55:02,311 --> 00:55:04,734
You gotta keep moving.
You gotta keep moving. Keep moving.

771
00:55:04,813 --> 00:55:08,568
Good! And listen to the music. You breathe.
He's getting it. He's getting it.

772
00:55:08,734 --> 00:55:11,237
You see? You feel it? Feel the music.

773
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,368
- Come on!
- Nice.

774
00:55:15,115 --> 00:55:16,367
Come on, baby!

775
00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:19,954
With Rashad Evans and Stephan Bonnar
and just five weeks left until Sparta,

776
00:55:20,037 --> 00:55:24,042
as the hype continues for the war
on the shore this Fourth of July weekend

777
00:55:24,124 --> 00:55:26,047
in Atlantic City. You know what that means.

778
00:55:26,126 --> 00:55:28,879
The great Koba bringing his act stateside.

779
00:55:28,963 --> 00:55:30,761
But I gotta ask you about the other guys.

780
00:55:30,839 --> 00:55:33,809
What are they thinking,
entering a winner-take-all tournament

781
00:55:33,884 --> 00:55:35,511
against a guy
that seemingly can't be beaten?

782
00:55:35,678 --> 00:55:38,306
They're thinking $5 million
and $5 million seems a lot of money,

783
00:55:38,389 --> 00:55:40,938
but they gotta remember one thing.
They're going against Koba.

784
00:55:41,016 --> 00:55:43,394
Mission impossible, game over, go home.

785
00:55:43,477 --> 00:55:45,150
Well, the winner takes home $5 million.

786
00:55:45,229 --> 00:55:47,903
You can be sure
this will dominate the sports landscape

787
00:55:47,982 --> 00:55:49,859
Fourth of July weekend in Atlantic City.

788
00:55:49,942 --> 00:55:53,992
The great Koba making his presence felt
in the United States.

789
00:55:54,196 --> 00:55:55,539
Two... Come on, Tommy.

790
00:55:55,614 --> 00:55:57,833
Hits you soft, right? Flow like water.

791
00:55:58,075 --> 00:55:59,748
Get on your arm,
watch what's gonna happen.

792
00:56:00,619 --> 00:56:02,997
There it is. Look, look, look.
He's going to sleep.

793
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:05,583
You train with the best
to be the best, Brendan.

794
00:56:09,753 --> 00:56:12,632
Pittsburgh Beatdown has become
one of the most watched videos

795
00:56:12,715 --> 00:56:14,433
on YouTube this year

796
00:56:14,508 --> 00:56:17,853
Now joining us, via satellite,
is the victim of the infamous incident,

797
00:56:17,928 --> 00:56:19,020
Mad Dog Grimes.

798
00:56:19,096 --> 00:56:22,976
Mad Dog, what is your response
to all the hoopla surrounding the video

799
00:56:23,058 --> 00:56:24,150
and Tommy Riordan?

800
00:56:24,226 --> 00:56:26,775
This guy's a nobody.
It's a sparring session.

801
00:56:26,854 --> 00:56:29,357
It is what it is,
and he's gonna pay for it next month

802
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,863
in Atlantic City.

803
00:56:32,109 --> 00:56:34,203
Good. Always move. Always move.

804
00:56:34,278 --> 00:56:37,703
I don't know, Marco. You're getting
a good game here from a physics teacher.

805
00:56:38,615 --> 00:56:39,912
Good! Good.

806
00:56:40,659 --> 00:56:42,753
You see? You see? Beautiful.

807
00:56:42,828 --> 00:56:46,082
Top of the food chain.
He's the next champ, right here.

808
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:56,262
So, with Sparta now
just two short weeks away,

809
00:56:56,342 --> 00:56:59,186
J.J. Riley and the Tapout crew
return to the US

810
00:56:59,261 --> 00:57:03,767
after a world tour that saw them visit
10 fighters in 10 different countries.

811
00:57:03,849 --> 00:57:06,477
They stopped in Philadelphia today
to check in on renowned trainer,

812
00:57:06,602 --> 00:57:07,694
Frank Campana,

813
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:10,523
and top contender, Marco Santos.

814
00:57:10,606 --> 00:57:13,029
You gotta relax and stay calm in there.

815
00:57:13,108 --> 00:57:14,985
The cage is your home.

816
00:57:15,069 --> 00:57:16,491
You set the pace.

817
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:18,243
You set the rhythm.

818
00:57:18,364 --> 00:57:20,332
Feel the Beethoven.

819
00:57:20,407 --> 00:57:24,128
Be smarter than him, more patient.
Wait for him to make a mistake.

820
00:57:24,787 --> 00:57:27,040
And when he does, that's your moment.

821
00:57:27,122 --> 00:57:28,874
I see it. I see it. I see it.

822
00:57:30,626 --> 00:57:32,299
No, he did not tap you!

823
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:36,140
Physics teacher!
That's the best in the business, son.

824
00:57:38,258 --> 00:57:39,555
You can do this, Son!

825
00:57:39,635 --> 00:57:42,388
Smoother There's more in you!
You got more in you!

826
00:57:42,471 --> 00:57:43,563
We're not done yet!

827
00:57:43,639 --> 00:57:46,483
He's beating you! He's beating you!

828
00:57:46,558 --> 00:57:49,528
You better push harden Marco!
Brendan's running away!

829
00:57:53,107 --> 00:57:55,576
And the winner by tap out

830
00:57:55,651 --> 00:57:58,495
”Irish” Brendan Conlon.

831
00:58:03,659 --> 00:58:08,085
"...To each and every man in turn
but mirrors back his own mysterious self

832
00:58:08,163 --> 00:58:13,169
"Great pains, small gains
for those who ask the world to solve them.

833
00:58:13,252 --> 00:58:15,801
”It cannot solve itself"

834
00:58:33,355 --> 00:58:35,198
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

835
00:58:35,274 --> 00:58:37,618
- You wanna grab a bite?
- No. I'm gonna head home.

836
00:58:37,693 --> 00:58:40,446
I gotta call the boys and break the news.

837
00:58:41,697 --> 00:58:44,200
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Okay.

838
00:58:52,958 --> 00:58:54,460
Coach!

839
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:02,351
Hey, I know this is not a really great time,

840
00:59:02,426 --> 00:59:05,600
and it's too bad about Marco.

841
00:59:08,557 --> 00:59:10,025
But how about me?

842
00:59:11,643 --> 00:59:12,644
Are you talking about Sparta?

843
00:59:13,395 --> 00:59:15,318
Yeah.

844
00:59:15,397 --> 00:59:16,990
Brendan, you've got a better shot
at starting a boy band.

845
00:59:17,065 --> 00:59:18,066
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

846
00:59:28,285 --> 00:59:29,958
It's a Grand Prix tournament.

847
00:59:32,164 --> 00:59:34,792
Which means anything could happen.
You know that as well as I do.

848
00:59:34,875 --> 00:59:36,377
Yeah.

849
00:59:38,253 --> 00:59:40,221
Come on. They'd have to kill me
to get me out of the cage.

850
00:59:41,131 --> 00:59:43,133
That's what I'm afraid of.

851
00:59:43,217 --> 00:59:44,719
Frank, I need this.

852
00:59:45,427 --> 00:59:48,772
You're real tight with these guys.
You could call them.

853
00:59:49,765 --> 00:59:52,689
You're the guy. They trust you.

854
00:59:55,938 --> 00:59:58,691
Brendan.

855
00:59:58,774 --> 01:00:00,742
You realize
what you're asking me to do here?

856
01:00:00,817 --> 01:00:02,319
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

857
01:00:02,444 --> 01:00:05,539
We go down to AC,
you get tapped out in five seconds.

858
01:00:05,614 --> 01:00:07,412
How does that benefit either one of us?

859
01:00:07,491 --> 01:00:10,711
- It's not gonna happen.
- Not gonna happen?

860
01:00:10,786 --> 01:00:12,754
Wish I had a nickel
for every time somebody told me that.

861
01:00:13,372 --> 01:00:15,045
It's not gonna happen.

862
01:00:30,472 --> 01:00:31,974
I'll make a call.

863
01:00:39,273 --> 01:00:42,117
I love my coach!

864
01:00:50,951 --> 01:00:53,955
Yeah, they're good. The girls are good.
They're good.

865
01:00:55,038 --> 01:00:56,130
Yeah, he should.

866
01:00:56,206 --> 01:00:58,755
I mean, you've been spending
so much time with Brendan these days,

867
01:00:58,834 --> 01:01:01,883
it's like you're part of the family
or something.

868
01:01:04,047 --> 01:01:07,597
Yeah, he's right here. it's your boyfriend.

869
01:01:09,219 --> 01:01:11,267
Frank. Hey, man.

870
01:01:18,228 --> 01:01:20,606
That's unbelievable.

871
01:01:21,773 --> 01:01:25,698
Wow! Wow, Frank, I can't thank you enough.
I don't know what to say.

872
01:01:27,487 --> 01:01:30,457
All right, listen, I gotta call you back, okay?

873
01:01:36,038 --> 01:01:38,336
All right. Bye.

874
01:01:39,583 --> 01:01:41,210
I'm in.

875
01:01:42,336 --> 01:01:44,589
- I'm going.
- Really?

876
01:01:45,714 --> 01:01:49,218
That's your decision? You decided?

877
01:01:51,303 --> 01:01:53,476
'Cause I really enjoyed the conversation
we just had

878
01:01:53,555 --> 01:01:56,559
about making that decision together.

879
01:02:00,437 --> 01:02:05,034
You told me you were gonna fight guys
that watched too much UFC.

880
01:02:05,108 --> 01:02:07,327
I saw the Koba dude on the television,

881
01:02:07,402 --> 01:02:09,325
and he's the guy they're watching.

882
01:02:09,404 --> 01:02:10,371
It's a lot of money, Tess.

883
01:02:10,447 --> 01:02:12,950
I don't give a shit about the money,
Brendan. I told you that.

884
01:02:14,201 --> 01:02:16,203
We're gonna end up
cashing in your life insurance policy

885
01:02:16,286 --> 01:02:17,754
before we pick up that prize money.

886
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:20,674
You don't think I can do it, right?

887
01:02:20,916 --> 01:02:22,759
I think you could get killed.

888
01:02:27,047 --> 01:02:28,845
- I'm not gonna get killed.
- You're not gonna get killed,

889
01:02:28,924 --> 01:02:30,346
but you promised me
you're not gonna get hurt.

890
01:02:30,425 --> 01:02:33,019
You're not gonna end up in the hospital.
You're not gonna end up paralyzed.

891
01:02:33,095 --> 01:02:35,644
We have no prize money, we have no house.

892
01:02:35,722 --> 01:02:38,771
- We have payments for hospital bills.
- Tess! Listen, I'll promise you this.

893
01:02:40,268 --> 01:02:43,363
If I don't try in three weeks,
they're gonna take the house.

894
01:02:44,898 --> 01:02:46,992
How's that for a promise?

895
01:02:51,029 --> 01:02:53,873
So, I'm gonna go, okay?

896
01:02:53,949 --> 01:02:57,203
But I'd really love it
if you'd be with me on this.

897
01:03:04,251 --> 01:03:06,720
I'm not gonna watch you fight again,
I'm not.

898
01:03:06,795 --> 01:03:09,218
I'm gonna get the girls breakfast.

899
01:03:39,077 --> 01:03:42,581
Fourth of July weekend
doesn't officially get started until tomorrow,

900
01:03:42,664 --> 01:03:45,133
but fight fans are already descending
on Atlantic City

901
01:03:45,208 --> 01:03:49,054
for the Super Bowl
of mixed martial arts, Sparta!

902
01:03:49,129 --> 01:03:51,928
We've got the dancing girls,
we've got the paparazzi,

903
01:03:52,007 --> 01:03:53,429
we've got the red carpet!

904
01:03:53,508 --> 01:03:57,012
And here comes J.J. Riley,
the man who started it all.

905
01:03:57,095 --> 01:03:59,939
J.J., you've made a fortune
with your hedge funds.

906
01:04:00,182 --> 01:04:01,729
You turned your back on Wall Street

907
01:04:01,808 --> 01:04:04,152
and dedicated your life
to making Sparta happen.

908
01:04:04,227 --> 01:04:07,481
Tell us why this tournament
is so important to you?

909
01:04:07,647 --> 01:04:08,694
Growing up, we all wanted to know

910
01:04:08,774 --> 01:04:10,993
who the toughest kid
in the neighborhood was, right?

911
01:04:11,067 --> 01:04:12,910
I wanna know
who the toughest man on the planet is.

912
01:04:12,986 --> 01:04:14,704
And that's why I put this thing together

913
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:17,579
That's what all these people are here to see,
come Saturday night.

914
01:04:17,657 --> 01:04:20,001
- That's what we're gonna find out.
- Thank you, J.J.

915
01:04:20,076 --> 01:04:24,798
And here's something fans never thought
they'd see. Koba is here.

916
01:04:24,873 --> 01:04:28,298
The legend arriving to fight on US soil
for the very first time.

917
01:04:28,376 --> 01:04:29,377
- Koba! Koba!
- Koba! Koba!

918
01:04:29,461 --> 01:04:32,431
Olympic gold medalist in wrestling,
world Sambo champion,

919
01:04:32,506 --> 01:04:35,305
undefeated in his mixed martial arts career.

920
01:04:35,383 --> 01:04:38,478
Nobody's survived a round
with the Russian in five years.

921
01:04:38,553 --> 01:04:41,056
He is the greatest fighter...

922
01:04:51,942 --> 01:04:53,865
I mean, you've seen our logos.

923
01:04:53,944 --> 01:04:56,197
No, yeah, I've seen your stuff. It looks good.

924
01:04:56,363 --> 01:04:57,831
I mean, is he fighting after Sparta?

925
01:04:57,906 --> 01:05:00,000
I mean, we're trying to find
some info on him.

926
01:05:00,075 --> 01:05:01,577
No, I'm not sure.

927
01:05:33,108 --> 01:05:35,657
Hey, Where'd you go? Where'd you go?

928
01:05:35,735 --> 01:05:38,454
You can't leave me like that.
They want to talk to you, not me.

929
01:05:38,655 --> 01:05:39,656
- Frank Campana?
- Yeah.

930
01:05:39,739 --> 01:05:41,457
Hi. Julia, J.J. Riley's assistant.

931
01:05:41,533 --> 01:05:43,331
- Julia, how are you?
- Brendan Conlon?

932
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:45,253
- Yeah, hi. Hey.
- Hi. Julia, J.J. Riley's assistant.

933
01:05:45,328 --> 01:05:46,545
- Right, hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

934
01:05:46,621 --> 01:05:47,838
A few things I want to let you guys know.

935
01:05:47,914 --> 01:05:50,838
- Press conference will start in 20 minutes.
- Okay.

936
01:05:50,917 --> 01:05:53,090
Brendan, you're gonna be sitting up
on the stage.

937
01:05:53,169 --> 01:05:54,466
Tommy!

938
01:05:54,713 --> 01:05:56,681
Hey, Tommy! Where you going?

939
01:05:56,923 --> 01:05:58,675
Can we stand with J.J.?

940
01:05:58,842 --> 01:06:01,345
”Hearing the tremendous rush
of the sea-crashing boat,

941
01:06:01,428 --> 01:06:05,399
"the whale wheeled round
to present his blank forehead at bay.

942
01:06:05,473 --> 01:06:09,728
”But in that evolution, catching sight
of the nearing black hull of the ship,

943
01:06:09,811 --> 01:06:13,566
"seemingly seeing in it
the source of all his persecutions,

944
01:06:13,648 --> 01:06:17,778
"bethinking it,
it may be a larger and nobler foe.

945
01:06:17,861 --> 01:06:21,491
”Of a sudden,
he bore down upon its advancing prow,

946
01:06:21,573 --> 01:06:25,498
"smiting his jaws
amid fiery showers of foam.

947
01:06:26,202 --> 01:06:29,046
”Ahab staggered,
his hand smote his forehead.

948
01:06:29,122 --> 01:06:30,874
"'I grow blind... "'

949
01:06:30,957 --> 01:06:32,709
Now, the only person missing
from the event

950
01:06:32,792 --> 01:06:35,295
was dark horse entry, Tommy Riordan.

951
01:06:35,378 --> 01:06:39,303
Recent revelations that Riordan
was not only a United States Marine,

952
01:06:39,382 --> 01:06:43,262
but a hero in the Iraq Wan
has cast an even wider spotlight

953
01:06:43,345 --> 01:06:45,939
on a fighter
who seems to have come out of nowhere.

954
01:06:46,014 --> 01:06:49,109
Lance Corporal Mark Bradford's
Web testimony to Riordan,

955
01:06:49,184 --> 01:06:51,653
who saved his life earlier this year in Iraq,

956
01:06:51,728 --> 01:06:54,698
is now spreading like wildfire
throughout the media.

957
01:06:54,773 --> 01:06:55,899
Tommy!

958
01:06:55,982 --> 01:06:57,484
And the bridge just crumbled.

959
01:06:57,567 --> 01:07:00,320
Tommy, come here.
Come on. You got to see this.

960
01:07:00,403 --> 01:07:05,159
The amtrac was upside down
and water was coming in from everywhere.

961
01:07:06,493 --> 01:07:09,292
And the water pressure was too much.
We couldn't get the back hatch open.

962
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,548
We were all drowning, man.

963
01:07:12,248 --> 01:07:14,171
It was a death trap.

964
01:07:14,459 --> 01:07:16,006
I couldn't have had more
than another minute.

965
01:07:17,128 --> 01:07:20,052
Then suddenly,
the back ramp gets ripped off

966
01:07:21,132 --> 01:07:22,805
There he was.

967
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:27,768
And before I could get out and thank him,
he was gone.

968
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:30,734
- He just vanished like a ghost.
- Tom my?

969
01:07:30,809 --> 01:07:34,063
- Tommy, did you... Where you going?
- Taking a walk.

970
01:07:35,563 --> 01:07:36,610
Tommy!

971
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:39,910
I really just wanted to say thank you.

972
01:07:41,069 --> 01:07:43,197
You saved my life, brother

973
01:07:44,531 --> 01:07:48,707
And anyone seeing this at Sparta,
anybody out in Pittsburgh,

974
01:07:49,411 --> 01:07:52,665
you reach out to Tommy Riordan
and tell him Mark said, "Thank you."

975
01:07:52,747 --> 01:07:55,671
Footage taken from a helmet cam
on the ground in Iraq

976
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:58,128
captured the heroic incident.

977
01:07:58,211 --> 01:07:59,508
Hello?

978
01:07:59,963 --> 01:08:01,089
Brendan?

979
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:44,599
Been looking all over for you.

980
01:08:46,718 --> 01:08:49,187
How's it going?

981
01:08:49,262 --> 01:08:50,980
It's going.

982
01:08:53,391 --> 01:08:56,235
I was thinking we should go grab a coffee.

983
01:08:57,771 --> 01:09:00,650
I don't drink coffee, man.
What do you want?

984
01:09:03,068 --> 01:09:04,194
You don't wanna go sit down somewhere?

985
01:09:07,655 --> 01:09:08,907
I'm good right here.

986
01:09:10,909 --> 01:09:12,126
Okay.

987
01:09:17,582 --> 01:09:21,678
Shit, Tommy, how was I supposed to know
I was never gonna see you guys again?

988
01:09:21,753 --> 01:09:23,130
Yeah, well, you were briefed.

989
01:09:25,006 --> 01:09:26,474
You had the information.

990
01:09:29,052 --> 01:09:31,680
You chose the old man and the girl.

991
01:09:31,763 --> 01:09:33,811
She wasn't just some girl.

992
01:09:36,392 --> 01:09:38,190
I married her.

993
01:09:40,522 --> 01:09:43,025
She's my wife.

994
01:09:43,108 --> 01:09:45,281
See?

995
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:47,783
That's Tess.

996
01:09:47,862 --> 01:09:50,240
That's Emily and Rosie.

997
01:09:50,323 --> 01:09:52,451
They're your nieces, Tommy.

998
01:09:52,534 --> 01:09:54,161
I don't know them.

999
01:09:54,244 --> 01:09:58,090
I know you don't know them.
Of course you don't know them.

1000
01:09:58,373 --> 01:10:01,718
So why am I looking at pictures
of people I don't know?

1001
01:10:02,836 --> 01:10:04,804
'Cause that's my family.

1002
01:10:07,048 --> 01:10:08,800
And who are you exactly?

1003
01:10:13,888 --> 01:10:15,231
I'm your brother, man.

1004
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:19,937
You were in the Corps?

1005
01:10:20,395 --> 01:10:21,897
What?

1006
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:25,234
- I said I didn't Know you were in the Corps.
- I wasn't in the Corps.

1007
01:10:26,442 --> 01:10:28,661
Then you ain't no brother to me.

1008
01:10:29,904 --> 01:10:31,247
My brother was in the Corps.

1009
01:10:31,906 --> 01:10:33,499
Jesus, Tommy. Tommy.

1010
01:10:33,616 --> 01:10:37,041
I was a 16-year-old kid.
What the hell did I know?

1011
01:10:37,453 --> 01:10:38,545
I don't know what you know.

1012
01:10:38,621 --> 01:10:40,248
Why don't you go ask your girlfriend
about it?

1013
01:10:40,331 --> 01:10:41,924
She's my wife, Tommy.

1014
01:10:42,041 --> 01:10:45,295
So, that's it? I stay with Tess,
I never get to see you guys again?

1015
01:10:45,378 --> 01:10:47,756
Not a single phone call? Nothing?

1016
01:10:49,382 --> 01:10:51,760
God, man, I don't understand this.

1017
01:10:52,510 --> 01:10:53,932
What? You...

1018
01:10:54,012 --> 01:10:57,687
So, you won't forgive me,
but you forgave Pop?

1019
01:10:59,767 --> 01:11:04,022
No, he's just some old vet that I train with,
you know? He means nothing to me.

1020
01:11:05,607 --> 01:11:08,451
And what I hear,
he means nothing to you, either.

1021
01:11:09,944 --> 01:11:13,164
You got balls talking about forgiveness.

1022
01:11:13,239 --> 01:11:14,991
That has nothing to do with forgiveness.

1023
01:11:15,074 --> 01:11:17,873
I got children, man. I got a family to protect.

1024
01:11:17,952 --> 01:11:19,954
Everything I do is for them.

1025
01:11:20,455 --> 01:11:22,503
I forgave Pop.

1026
01:11:22,582 --> 01:11:24,425
Just like I forgave you and Mom.

1027
01:11:31,799 --> 01:11:33,301
You forgave us?

1028
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:36,517
Yeah.

1029
01:11:37,513 --> 01:11:39,607
Well, I'm not surprised
you made the tournament, Brendan.

1030
01:11:39,682 --> 01:11:41,776
You got some stones, man.

1031
01:11:41,851 --> 01:11:44,445
I fell in love.
What the hell was I supposed to do?

1032
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:47,239
You were supposed to stick to the plan.
You were supposed to come with us.

1033
01:11:47,315 --> 01:11:50,819
Mom needed you, I needed you.
You're my big brother. You bailed on me.

1034
01:11:52,654 --> 01:11:54,748
Hey, you know, I'm glad you stayed.
Everything worked out for you.

1035
01:11:54,822 --> 01:11:55,869
God.

1036
01:11:55,949 --> 01:11:59,579
You leave, you get the opposite. Okay?

1037
01:11:59,661 --> 01:12:02,335
You leave, you get to bury people.

1038
01:12:02,413 --> 01:12:05,337
You're not the only one
that suffered, Tommy.

1039
01:12:07,210 --> 01:12:09,554
I didn't even know she was sick.

1040
01:12:11,089 --> 01:12:14,684
I never even got the chance to say goodbye
to my own mother.

1041
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:21,229
You had no right to keep that from me.
That was not your decision to make!

1042
01:12:23,393 --> 01:12:25,691
You know what?

1043
01:12:25,770 --> 01:12:29,195
You walk around
with your pictures of your wife,

1044
01:12:29,274 --> 01:12:31,572
and you're all, "I forgive you.

1045
01:12:32,694 --> 01:12:34,196
"I forgive Pop.

1046
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:36,452
"I forgive everyone."

1047
01:12:36,531 --> 01:12:38,033
Brendan, you know,

1048
01:12:39,742 --> 01:12:41,540
you're full of shit.

1049
01:12:47,709 --> 01:12:50,337
Are we done, Brendan? Are we finished?

1050
01:13:10,398 --> 01:13:12,867
You realize you're supposed to seek
my wise counsel

1051
01:13:12,942 --> 01:13:15,070
while school's actually in session, right?

1052
01:13:15,153 --> 01:13:17,076
- Yes, Principal Z.
- Tell him.

1053
01:13:17,155 --> 01:13:19,453
Okay, we wanna use the auditorium
this weekend

1054
01:13:19,532 --> 01:13:21,500
to watch Mr. C in Sparta.

1055
01:13:21,576 --> 01:13:23,249
What do you say?

1056
01:13:23,328 --> 01:13:25,001
So, you want to use the auditorium

1057
01:13:25,079 --> 01:13:28,709
to watch a suspended teacher engage
in the activity that he was suspended for?

1058
01:13:28,791 --> 01:13:30,043
- Right.
- Am I hearing this correct?

1059
01:13:30,126 --> 01:13:32,003
Right. Okay, we thought you would say that,

1060
01:13:32,086 --> 01:13:33,929
so it could turn into a fundraiser,
you know?

1061
01:13:34,005 --> 01:13:36,053
You know,
I think you need to talk to your parents,

1062
01:13:36,132 --> 01:13:38,260
because you guys might need
to be in summer school.

1063
01:13:38,343 --> 01:13:39,765
- Everybody wants this.
- Come on, Mr. Zito.

1064
01:13:39,844 --> 01:13:41,346
We've been telling everybody
about it already.

1065
01:13:41,429 --> 01:13:42,430
- Exactly.
- And the gym's the only place

1066
01:13:42,513 --> 01:13:44,811
- that's big enough to fit everyone.
- Look, it's never gonna happen.

1067
01:13:44,891 --> 01:13:47,394
- What if we get a petition signed?
- We'll get the whole school to sign it.

1068
01:13:47,477 --> 01:13:49,354
- The power of democracy.
- What are they gonna do about that?

1069
01:13:49,437 --> 01:13:50,404
Mr. Z, please?

1070
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:53,529
Look, look, you guys. I appreciate the fact
that you love your teacher, I really do,

1071
01:13:53,608 --> 01:13:56,657
but there is nothing I can do for you.

1072
01:14:30,561 --> 01:14:34,282
The roof is about to blow clean off
Boardwalk Hall Arena.

1073
01:14:34,357 --> 01:14:39,284
It might be Fourth of July weekend,
but this is Christmas Eve for fight fans.

1074
01:14:39,362 --> 01:14:43,583
This is Atlantic City.
This is the War on the Shore,

1075
01:14:43,658 --> 01:14:46,582
and this is
what everyone's been waiting for

1076
01:14:46,661 --> 01:14:51,508
Sixteen of the baddest men on the planet
duking it out over a 24-hour period

1077
01:14:51,582 --> 01:14:55,007
for the largest purse
in mixed martial arts history.

1078
01:14:55,086 --> 01:14:58,090
In the town everyone knows
from the game of Monopoly,

1079
01:14:58,172 --> 01:15:01,221
we got ourselves a winner-take-all affair

1080
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:06,602
Buckle your seatbelts, roll the dice,
and take a ride on the Reading.

1081
01:15:06,681 --> 01:15:09,810
Sparta is here!

1082
01:15:10,059 --> 01:15:11,902
Welcome, I'm Bryan Callen,

1083
01:15:11,978 --> 01:15:14,731
along with bestselling fight author,
Sam Sheridan.

1084
01:15:14,856 --> 01:15:17,905
Sam, when J.J. Riley conceived Sparta,

1085
01:15:17,984 --> 01:15:19,861
he wanted to create, quite simply,

1086
01:15:19,944 --> 01:15:23,869
the biggest mixed martial arts spectacle
in history.

1087
01:15:24,115 --> 01:15:27,164
$5 million, Bryan. $5 million.

1088
01:15:27,243 --> 01:15:29,666
J.J. Riley put his money where his mouth is

1089
01:15:29,745 --> 01:15:33,170
and put up the biggest purse
the sport has ever seen.

1090
01:15:33,249 --> 01:15:35,047
It's unprecedented, Sam.

1091
01:15:35,126 --> 01:15:39,472
As is the hoopla surrounding
one Tommy Riordan, the war hero,

1092
01:15:39,547 --> 01:15:41,970
who has become an overnight sensation

1093
01:15:42,049 --> 01:15:44,051
and captured the imagination
and attention...

1094
01:15:47,555 --> 01:15:49,899
Jujitsu black belt Francisco Barbosa,

1095
01:15:49,974 --> 01:15:53,228
who has a 19 to four record
in his mixed martial arts' career

1096
01:15:53,728 --> 01:15:56,072
Our rules of the cage are brought to you
by Tapout.

1097
01:15:59,066 --> 01:16:01,785
- Five minutes, Paddy.
- Okay.

1098
01:16:03,821 --> 01:16:07,416
It looks as though the moment of truth
has arrived,

1099
01:16:07,492 --> 01:16:10,211
- because here comes Tommy Riordan.
- Wow!

1100
01:16:10,286 --> 01:16:12,505
Tommy Riordan's
captured the media 's attention,

1101
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:14,548
but the question still remains.

1102
01:16:14,749 --> 01:16:16,001
Who is this guy?

1103
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:17,551
And more importantly,

1104
01:16:17,627 --> 01:16:20,551
can he compete in this talent pool?
Can he win?

1105
01:16:20,630 --> 01:16:22,382
I wish I knew. I wish I knew who he was.

1106
01:16:22,465 --> 01:16:26,186
And I say the fact that I don't know
is very strange.

1107
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:28,433
In an Internet age
where there are no secrets,

1108
01:16:28,513 --> 01:16:30,390
this guy's a complete mystery.

1109
01:16:30,473 --> 01:16:32,441
I can't find out anything about him.

1110
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:35,604
Tommy Riordan is officially Google-proof.

1111
01:16:38,397 --> 01:16:40,274
Get your hands off me.

1112
01:16:41,567 --> 01:16:42,614
Okay, let's go.

1113
01:16:42,693 --> 01:16:43,990
You gotta love this guy, Sam.

1114
01:16:44,070 --> 01:16:46,949
No walk-out music,
no sponsors, no interviews.

1115
01:16:47,073 --> 01:16:48,916
He skipped the press conference,

1116
01:16:48,991 --> 01:16:51,369
wouldn't have his picture taken
for the program.

1117
01:16:51,452 --> 01:16:53,204
He's breaking every rule.

1118
01:16:53,913 --> 01:16:56,541
The only reason, really,
that Tommy Riordan is in this tournament

1119
01:16:56,624 --> 01:17:01,130
is an MMA video making the rounds of him
beating up Mad Dog Grimes in the gym.

1120
01:17:01,212 --> 01:17:03,931
But the reason
that a lot of his fans are in the stands

1121
01:17:04,006 --> 01:17:05,599
is because of another video.

1122
01:17:05,675 --> 01:17:08,349
It's even more stunning
than the Mad Dog Grimes video.

1123
01:17:08,427 --> 01:17:10,179
This guy... Let me describe it to you, folks,

1124
01:17:10,304 --> 01:17:12,557
for the few that haven't seen it,
and I don't know anybody who hasn't,

1125
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:16,190
but Tommy Riordan ripped the door
off a tank

1126
01:17:16,269 --> 01:17:19,239
in the heat of battle,
saving lives in the process,

1127
01:17:19,313 --> 01:17:21,281
and then walked away
without claiming a medal.

1128
01:17:21,357 --> 01:17:22,700
- Listen...
- He ripped the door off a tank.

1129
01:17:22,775 --> 01:17:24,652
Tommy Riordan is a genuine war hero.

1130
01:17:24,735 --> 01:17:28,080
I'm not taking anything away from the guy,
he's a very, very tough guy,

1131
01:17:28,155 --> 01:17:30,829
- but the tank don't hit back, you know.
- Sam...

1132
01:17:30,908 --> 01:17:33,331
We've seen YouTube sensations fail
on a big stage before.

1133
01:17:33,411 --> 01:17:35,880
Sam, he ripped the door off a tank!

1134
01:17:39,208 --> 01:17:41,461
Tommy Riordan,
he has definitely got his hands full

1135
01:17:41,544 --> 01:17:44,047
in his first opponent, Francisco Barbosa.

1136
01:17:44,130 --> 01:17:45,598
- Francisco Barbosa...
- He's nothing to scoff at.

1137
01:17:45,673 --> 01:17:47,391
Yeah, he's the octopus. He's the real deal.

1138
01:17:48,509 --> 01:17:51,638
He's a very, very tough guy,
a very high-caliber fighter.

1139
01:17:51,721 --> 01:17:53,394
Now, Tommy Riordan came out of nowhere,

1140
01:17:53,472 --> 01:17:55,850
and I'd imagine he's gonna disappear
just as quickly.

1141
01:17:55,933 --> 01:17:56,934
It's a great story,

1142
01:17:57,018 --> 01:18:00,067
but I think your boy
is gonna be exposed here

1143
01:18:00,187 --> 01:18:01,609
- as a YouTube sensation.
- Well, well,

1144
01:18:01,689 --> 01:18:04,818
a lot of fans here in Boardwalk Hall
hope you're wrong, Sam.

1145
01:18:05,359 --> 01:18:07,077
All right, gentlemen,
you've been given your instructions.

1146
01:18:07,153 --> 01:18:08,700
I expect a clean fight.

1147
01:18:08,779 --> 01:18:10,122
Obey my command at all times,

1148
01:18:10,197 --> 01:18:11,494
defend yourselves at all times.

1149
01:18:11,824 --> 01:18:13,371
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1150
01:18:15,953 --> 01:18:18,001
Tommy, cut off the corners,
feel this guy out,

1151
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:19,548
just like we know. Just like we know.

1152
01:18:19,624 --> 01:18:22,503
We're about to get the big answer
to the big question.

1153
01:18:22,585 --> 01:18:24,804
Is Tommy Riordan for real?

1154
01:18:24,879 --> 01:18:27,098
- Gentlemen, you ready?
- They are both game fighters.

1155
01:18:27,173 --> 01:18:28,925
- And here we go.
- You ready?

1156
01:18:29,050 --> 01:18:30,142
Let's go to war!

1157
01:18:30,217 --> 01:18:31,810
Keep your focus, Tom.

1158
01:18:31,886 --> 01:18:33,638
And here we go. We're gonna see this.

1159
01:18:33,721 --> 01:18:35,098
Barbosa's gonna be looking for a takedown.

1160
01:18:35,181 --> 01:18:37,229
He's definitely looking for a takedown here.

1161
01:18:41,854 --> 01:18:45,074
Barbosa is down!
Barbosa has been knocked out!

1162
01:18:45,149 --> 01:18:48,323
Tommy Riordan is most definitely for real.

1163
01:18:48,402 --> 01:18:51,997
And now he's walking out of the cage.
He's leaving the cage.

1164
01:18:52,073 --> 01:18:53,620
Hey, Tommy!

1165
01:18:53,699 --> 01:18:55,793
There goes another rule, out the window!

1166
01:18:56,577 --> 01:18:57,920
Where you going?

1167
01:18:58,371 --> 01:19:01,045
Francisco Barbosa is out cold,

1168
01:19:01,123 --> 01:19:03,797
and he is out of this tournament, Bryan.

1169
01:19:04,710 --> 01:19:06,712
- A huge left hook, launching...
- Good. Nice and easy. Nice and easy.

1170
01:19:06,796 --> 01:19:09,675
- ...Tommy Riordan into the second round.
- One, two. Good, good. One, two, three.

1171
01:19:09,757 --> 01:19:12,306
Good. Two, three.

1172
01:19:12,385 --> 01:19:14,058
Good. Good, good, good.

1173
01:19:14,136 --> 01:19:17,015
- Good. Come on. Good. One, two.
- Tommy Riordan is the real deal.

1174
01:19:18,599 --> 01:19:21,193
- Showtime.
- All right. Come on, give me eight.

1175
01:19:23,688 --> 01:19:25,861
Yes! That's my boy.

1176
01:20:08,816 --> 01:20:10,489
Let's go, move your head around.

1177
01:20:16,907 --> 01:20:18,454
You ready?

1178
01:20:22,288 --> 01:20:23,665
Look at me.

1179
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:29,257
You can do this.

1180
01:20:35,843 --> 01:20:37,641
I wanna hear you say it.

1181
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:44,272
I can do this.

1182
01:20:45,144 --> 01:20:46,771
Let's go do this.

1183
01:20:48,481 --> 01:20:49,733
Yeah.

1184
01:20:54,945 --> 01:20:56,071
Yeah.

1185
01:21:03,621 --> 01:21:07,717
J.J. Riley only had 48 hours,
less than 48 hours, to fill the spot.

1186
01:21:07,792 --> 01:21:10,671
And basically, he had to go on the road
to Frank Campana.

1187
01:21:10,753 --> 01:21:12,847
Well, then he chose Brendan Conlon,

1188
01:21:12,922 --> 01:21:14,674
which is really something
I don't understand.

1189
01:21:14,757 --> 01:21:16,725
I just... I'm shocked.

1190
01:21:21,555 --> 01:21:23,853
Hey, Brendan. Brendan, go get him.

1191
01:21:26,977 --> 01:21:28,229
Go. Good luck.

1192
01:21:29,313 --> 01:21:30,986
Let's go, Brendan.

1193
01:21:31,857 --> 01:21:33,700
You go get him, Son!

1194
01:21:33,776 --> 01:21:35,870
You know, I can understand
coming out to no music,

1195
01:21:35,945 --> 01:21:39,495
but why in the world would you choose
classical music as your entrance?

1196
01:21:39,573 --> 01:21:42,372
This is Beethoven.
This is Ode to Joy, Bryan.

1197
01:21:42,451 --> 01:21:44,419
My apologies, Mr. Renaissance Man.

1198
01:21:45,955 --> 01:21:47,628
Go get him, Son.

1199
01:21:47,706 --> 01:21:51,301
If you wanna talk about Renaissance men,
you gotta talk about Frank Campana.

1200
01:21:51,377 --> 01:21:54,426
Very unorthodox trainer,
but one of the best trainers in the game,

1201
01:21:54,755 --> 01:21:58,760
and he's well known for using classical
music to teach his fighters to remain calm,

1202
01:21:58,843 --> 01:22:02,268
to remain patient,
and to remain composed under pressure.

1203
01:22:02,346 --> 01:22:05,976
You know, I'll tell you, classical music
is about as fitting to this setting

1204
01:22:06,058 --> 01:22:08,777
as Brendan Conlon is to this tournament.

1205
01:22:08,936 --> 01:22:10,279
- Come on.
- In fact, let me show you something.

1206
01:22:10,354 --> 01:22:11,355
Right here. Let me tell you...

1207
01:22:11,438 --> 01:22:12,860
- What?
- You see that, right there?

1208
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:16,786
That, right there...
That, my friend, is Brendan Conlon.

1209
01:22:16,986 --> 01:22:20,741
Okay? Brendan Conlon's about
to be dropped into a shark tank.

1210
01:22:20,823 --> 01:22:22,075
He's a feeder fish.

1211
01:22:22,157 --> 01:22:23,659
Come on, give the guy a break.

1212
01:22:23,742 --> 01:22:26,086
You know, the guy...
At least we've seen him fight.

1213
01:22:26,161 --> 01:22:28,630
I mean, he's fought real guys.
He's been in the UFC.

1214
01:22:28,706 --> 01:22:30,674
- We remember him from that.
- I remember him, too.

1215
01:22:30,749 --> 01:22:32,797
I remember him being very unmemorable.

1216
01:22:52,897 --> 01:22:56,117
Midnight Le getting ready
to climb into the cage and go to work.

1217
01:22:56,191 --> 01:22:57,238
When the brackets were announced,

1218
01:22:57,318 --> 01:22:59,161
he thought he'd be going up
against Marco Santos.

1219
01:22:59,236 --> 01:23:02,206
He's got to be thrilled to be seeing
Brendan Conlon across from him.

1220
01:23:02,281 --> 01:23:04,375
Hey! You asked for it.

1221
01:23:05,159 --> 01:23:07,753
Brendan retired from fighting
some years ago.

1222
01:23:07,828 --> 01:23:10,422
He's actually
a high school physics teacher now,

1223
01:23:10,497 --> 01:23:13,421
and Midnight had some fun with that
at the press conference yesterday.

1224
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:16,174
Well, he said he was going to give
the teacher a serious lesson,

1225
01:23:16,253 --> 01:23:19,598
and that getting killed was no way
to spend a summer vacation.

1226
01:23:19,673 --> 01:23:23,348
Midnight is known for talking trash,
he's also known for backing it up.

1227
01:23:23,427 --> 01:23:25,395
No question, Bryan.
He's in a lot of trouble here.

1228
01:23:25,471 --> 01:23:29,101
- Midnight Le is an agent of destruction.
- Gentlemen.

1229
01:23:31,727 --> 01:23:33,104
Go get him.

1230
01:23:36,315 --> 01:23:37,862
All right, guys,
you've been given your instructions.

1231
01:23:37,942 --> 01:23:39,364
I expect a clean fight.

1232
01:23:39,443 --> 01:23:42,947
Obey my commands at all times.
Defend yourselves at all times.

1233
01:23:43,030 --> 01:23:45,203
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1234
01:23:46,659 --> 01:23:48,536
Go have some fun, baby.

1235
01:23:52,790 --> 01:23:54,042
Gentlemen, you ready?

1236
01:23:55,626 --> 01:23:57,720
You ready? Let's go to war!

1237
01:24:01,882 --> 01:24:05,056
Work your kicks!

1238
01:24:07,972 --> 01:24:09,599
Come on, Brendan, come on.

1239
01:24:09,932 --> 01:24:11,559
Move! You gotta move, you gotta move.

1240
01:24:12,393 --> 01:24:14,145
Let it out! Come on, move!

1241
01:24:18,315 --> 01:24:20,033
Stay away from the legs! Circle!

1242
01:24:20,150 --> 01:24:21,527
In and out!

1243
01:24:27,908 --> 01:24:29,410
Get off the fence!

1244
01:24:30,995 --> 01:24:32,918
Get through this. Sprawl down!

1245
01:24:33,622 --> 01:24:36,466
Get off the fence! Get off the fence!

1246
01:24:37,918 --> 01:24:39,340
There he goes!

1247
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:40,763
Come on, Brendan. Get out of there!

1248
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:42,677
Come on!

1249
01:24:43,590 --> 01:24:44,637
Get up!

1250
01:24:46,135 --> 01:24:48,263
- Come on! Come on!
- Watch the back of the head!

1251
01:24:48,345 --> 01:24:50,518
- Relax, you're okay. You're okay!
- Midnight is all over Brendan.

1252
01:24:50,597 --> 01:24:53,100
Well, this can't last much longer.
This won't last much longer.

1253
01:24:53,183 --> 01:24:55,606
The teacher just has no answers.

1254
01:24:55,686 --> 01:24:57,688
Get out of there! Get out of there!

1255
01:24:59,189 --> 01:25:01,487
- And now, he's got the hooks in.
- The hooks are in.

1256
01:25:01,567 --> 01:25:03,615
- Brendan in very big trouble.
- The end is close.

1257
01:25:03,736 --> 01:25:05,613
Can Brendan make the end of the round?

1258
01:25:06,488 --> 01:25:07,535
Well, he's got the choke.

1259
01:25:07,614 --> 01:25:09,207
- He's got 20 seconds left in the round...
- Come on.

1260
01:25:09,283 --> 01:25:12,378
And Conlon's face is turning purple.
This looks like it's over.

1261
01:25:12,453 --> 01:25:14,751
Get up! Find his legs!

1262
01:25:14,830 --> 01:25:16,707
Hips! Hip down!

1263
01:25:16,790 --> 01:25:19,168
Hip down! Get your weight down!

1264
01:25:19,251 --> 01:25:20,719
Get your weight down!

1265
01:25:20,794 --> 01:25:23,263
Well, Midnight is squeezing
with all his might. He's got it very deep.

1266
01:25:23,338 --> 01:25:25,932
- Ten seconds! Don't you tap!
- Ten seconds, Bryan, 10 seconds.

1267
01:25:26,050 --> 01:25:28,178
Don't tap! Brendan, don't you tap!

1268
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:29,720
Hold on, Brendan.

1269
01:25:29,803 --> 01:25:31,305
Conlon doing his best to hang on,

1270
01:25:31,388 --> 01:25:33,356
'cause his whole world's about to go
from day to night.

1271
01:25:33,432 --> 01:25:35,685
Don't you tap! Don't you tap, Brendan!

1272
01:25:38,812 --> 01:25:40,985
I cannot believe that, Sam!

1273
01:25:41,065 --> 01:25:43,238
I thought for sure this guy
was going to sleep.

1274
01:25:45,819 --> 01:25:47,867
Midnight can't believe it either, by the way.

1275
01:25:48,822 --> 01:25:50,369
Jesus.

1276
01:25:53,368 --> 01:25:55,791
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1277
01:25:55,871 --> 01:25:59,751
You should've had him in the first round.

1278
01:26:00,876 --> 01:26:04,005
Beautiful. Beautiful.
He doesn't know what hit him.

1279
01:26:04,088 --> 01:26:05,931
He doesn't know what hit him. Breathe.

1280
01:26:06,507 --> 01:26:07,679
Deep breaths. Come on now.

1281
01:26:07,966 --> 01:26:10,139
Small sip, small sip. Small sip.

1282
01:26:10,219 --> 01:26:12,563
Deep breath, deep breath.
I want you to do something.

1283
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:15,353
I want you to get him to pull, okay?

1284
01:26:15,432 --> 01:26:18,185
When he pulls, I want you to hit him a bit
and I want you to shoot on him.

1285
01:26:18,268 --> 01:26:21,363
I'd love to be a fly on the wall,
listening to Frank Campana right now

1286
01:26:21,438 --> 01:26:22,485
and hear what he's saying in there.

1287
01:26:22,564 --> 01:26:24,237
In and out. In and out. In and out.

1288
01:26:24,316 --> 01:26:27,320
And I want you to trade punches
with him, all right? You're doing beautiful.

1289
01:26:28,529 --> 01:26:30,281
Let's go, seconds out!

1290
01:26:30,364 --> 01:26:31,581
Knock him out. Knock him out.
Knock him out.

1291
01:26:31,657 --> 01:26:32,783
This round, knock him out.

1292
01:26:32,866 --> 01:26:34,960
- Let's do it.
- He doesn't deserve to be here.

1293
01:26:35,035 --> 01:26:37,003
Beautiful. Breathe.

1294
01:26:37,079 --> 01:26:38,376
Let's go!

1295
01:26:40,874 --> 01:26:44,094
And here we go. The teacher
answering the bell for round two.

1296
01:26:44,169 --> 01:26:45,261
Nice and easy!

1297
01:26:46,296 --> 01:26:48,298
Set the pace! Set the pace, Brendan!

1298
01:26:48,382 --> 01:26:50,384
Gentlemen! Let's go to war!

1299
01:27:06,233 --> 01:27:08,986
Circle around! Circle around!

1300
01:27:09,653 --> 01:27:10,700
Nice and easy!

1301
01:27:11,864 --> 01:27:13,241
Good, good!

1302
01:27:13,323 --> 01:27:15,325
Shoot! Shoot on him!

1303
01:27:17,578 --> 01:27:22,004
Get Out Of there! Hitch him! Hitch him!
Hitch him!

1304
01:27:23,458 --> 01:27:25,802
Get out of there!
Get out of there! Get out of there! Come on!

1305
01:27:28,088 --> 01:27:29,260
Do something.

1306
01:27:32,092 --> 01:27:33,184
Shoot! Shoot on him!

1307
01:27:33,802 --> 01:27:34,974
Shoot on him!

1308
01:27:37,723 --> 01:27:38,815
Yes!

1309
01:27:38,891 --> 01:27:40,985
Conlon shoots on Midnight Le
and gets him down.

1310
01:27:41,059 --> 01:27:42,561
Midnight is trying to get to his...

1311
01:27:43,770 --> 01:27:45,613
- Scissors takedown.
- A beautiful scissors takedown.

1312
01:27:45,689 --> 01:27:47,566
- Really nice.
- Conlon showing signs of life

1313
01:27:47,649 --> 01:27:49,447
and not backing down.

1314
01:27:49,526 --> 01:27:50,743
Knees, knees!

1315
01:27:54,323 --> 01:27:55,370
Good!

1316
01:27:55,449 --> 01:27:57,577
Take his arm! Good!

1317
01:27:58,660 --> 01:28:01,539
- He's got a kimura lock!
- He's got a very good Kimura.

1318
01:28:01,622 --> 01:28:04,967
Turn your hips in! In!

1319
01:28:05,042 --> 01:28:08,012
Up! Stay with him. Turn your hips in!

1320
01:28:09,922 --> 01:28:11,890
Hips up! Turn your hips in!

1321
01:28:11,965 --> 01:28:13,262
Turn your hips in!

1322
01:28:13,759 --> 01:28:15,978
You got it, Brendan. Your round. You got it!

1323
01:28:16,094 --> 01:28:18,222
Turn your hips up and in!

1324
01:28:18,555 --> 01:28:20,398
Hips up! Very good!

1325
01:28:20,974 --> 01:28:22,066
He's in a lot of trouble.

1326
01:28:22,142 --> 01:28:23,985
That's it! Come on! Come on!

1327
01:28:24,061 --> 01:28:27,031
- Wow! He's got it very, very deep.
- Midnight is in a very, very bad position.

1328
01:28:27,105 --> 01:28:28,197
Midnight is in big trouble.

1329
01:28:28,273 --> 01:28:31,243
Slow down! Relax! You got it! You got it!

1330
01:28:31,318 --> 01:28:32,945
Brendan Conlon is going
to finish it right here!

1331
01:28:33,028 --> 01:28:34,871
Brendan Conlon has got
him in a very, very dangerous position

1332
01:28:34,947 --> 01:28:36,620
- and Midnight is in big trouble.
- Midnight...

1333
01:28:36,698 --> 01:28:38,166
I don't think Midnight has anywhere to go.

1334
01:28:38,325 --> 01:28:40,327
You got it! You got it!

1335
01:28:40,744 --> 01:28:43,918
Slow down! Relax! You got it! You got it!

1336
01:28:44,373 --> 01:28:47,547
And this isn't... This isn't happening!

1337
01:28:47,626 --> 01:28:49,503
- This can't happen.
- It just did, Bryan.

1338
01:28:49,753 --> 01:28:50,754
He tapped!

1339
01:28:51,046 --> 01:28:52,889
Brendan Conlon tapped Midnight!

1340
01:28:52,965 --> 01:28:55,434
- I can't believe that.
- Oh, my goodness!

1341
01:28:55,509 --> 01:28:58,228
You got him! Way to go, Brendan!

1342
01:29:02,432 --> 01:29:04,560
Yeah! Yeah! He tapped him out.

1343
01:29:04,851 --> 01:29:06,194
Honey, he tapped him out!

1344
01:29:06,311 --> 01:29:09,406
He did it! He did it! He did it! He did it!

1345
01:29:09,481 --> 01:29:12,109
Way to go, Brendan! Way to go! Yeah!

1346
01:29:12,567 --> 01:29:14,990
This is what's so great
about mixed martial arts.

1347
01:29:15,070 --> 01:29:16,822
There's so many ways to lose.

1348
01:29:16,905 --> 01:29:21,251
One tiny miscalculation,
anyone can win at anytime.

1349
01:29:21,326 --> 01:29:23,749
Which is probably why Frank Campana's
embracing his man.

1350
01:29:23,829 --> 01:29:28,630
And I honestly don't think either
one of them can believe what just happened.

1351
01:29:28,709 --> 01:29:31,178
Great show of sportsmanship here
from the teacher.

1352
01:29:31,253 --> 01:29:33,927
Well, that's a hallmark
of Frank Campana's philosophy,

1353
01:29:34,006 --> 01:29:35,633
something all his fighters buy into,

1354
01:29:35,716 --> 01:29:37,684
and, obviously, none more so than Brendan.

1355
01:29:37,759 --> 01:29:39,477
And Midnight Le is shocked.

1356
01:29:39,553 --> 01:29:41,555
He thought he'd get a free pass
into the second round,

1357
01:29:41,638 --> 01:29:42,935
but, instead, he's going home.

1358
01:29:43,015 --> 01:29:47,236
Dominated the fight the entire way,
but he falls prey to a very technical finish.

1359
01:29:47,311 --> 01:29:49,359
A very technical finish, but that's a fluke.

1360
01:29:49,438 --> 01:29:51,406
- I don't care what anybody says. That is a...
- I don't know.

1361
01:29:51,481 --> 01:29:54,325
You can call it a fluke, but I'm gonna call it
a guy maintaining composure

1362
01:29:54,401 --> 01:29:56,244
and waiting for his opportunity.

1363
01:29:57,237 --> 01:30:00,491
Conlon beats Midnight! Unbelievable!

1364
01:30:02,242 --> 01:30:04,119
I hope you got a receipt for your goldfish.

1365
01:30:27,059 --> 01:30:28,231
Yes!

1366
01:30:30,103 --> 01:30:31,104
Okay.

1367
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:45,202
We 're down to eight fighters,
and soon to be seven,

1368
01:30:45,285 --> 01:30:48,084
as Koba prepares to go to work
for the second time tonight.

1369
01:30:53,585 --> 01:30:54,711
- Right hand.
- Huge right hand.

1370
01:30:54,795 --> 01:30:56,172
- Huge right hand.
- Oh, my goodness.

1371
01:30:56,505 --> 01:30:58,599
Oh, my God! This is over.

1372
01:30:58,673 --> 01:31:00,596
Once again, Koba does not break a sweat.

1373
01:31:00,967 --> 01:31:03,561
You got to be kidding me. I'm afraid
he might have broken something else.

1374
01:31:03,637 --> 01:31:05,014
That's certainly possible.

1375
01:31:05,138 --> 01:31:07,561
Koba moving on to tomorrow night.

1376
01:31:07,641 --> 01:31:09,643
- Koba! Koba!
- Koba! Koba!

1377
01:31:10,936 --> 01:31:13,405
Mad Dog fighting like a man possessed.

1378
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:15,232
Like a man with something to prove,

1379
01:31:15,315 --> 01:31:19,320
reminding everyone why he is a
serious contender to win this whole contest.

1380
01:31:19,528 --> 01:31:23,658
He wanted to send a message to
Tommy Riordan, and there it is, right there.

1381
01:31:24,241 --> 01:31:26,414
Here comes the underdog, Brendan Conlon.

1382
01:31:26,493 --> 01:31:28,916
The teacher miraculously
passed his first test,

1383
01:31:28,995 --> 01:31:30,497
but now he's got to face The Dane.

1384
01:31:30,580 --> 01:31:33,129
Brendan! You can do it.

1385
01:31:35,919 --> 01:31:38,718
Halfway through round three, now,
and the beating continues.

1386
01:31:38,797 --> 01:31:42,847
I honestly don't know how Brendan Conlon
can take this kind of punishment.

1387
01:31:42,926 --> 01:31:44,849
He has been battered without mercy

1388
01:31:44,928 --> 01:31:46,396
- in both of his fights today.
- Relax! You're okay!

1389
01:31:46,471 --> 01:31:48,144
He's still standing, Bryan.

1390
01:31:50,058 --> 01:31:51,310
Beethoven!

1391
01:31:51,393 --> 01:31:52,986
No! No, no, no!

1392
01:31:55,021 --> 01:31:56,273
Good, take him down!

1393
01:31:57,649 --> 01:31:59,276
Look at this, he's taking The Dane down!

1394
01:31:59,359 --> 01:32:00,406
Hold on to him.

1395
01:32:00,777 --> 01:32:03,121
He's looking for that arm.
He's looking for the armbar.

1396
01:32:03,196 --> 01:32:05,039
- He's got an armbar.
- He's got that armbar.

1397
01:32:05,115 --> 01:32:06,913
He's looking to be boss of it, once again.

1398
01:32:06,992 --> 01:32:08,539
Tap, tap, tap! Come on, tap, tap, tap!

1399
01:32:09,453 --> 01:32:11,876
Palms flat! Palms flat! Thumbs up!

1400
01:32:12,706 --> 01:32:14,049
He's got that arm, Sam!

1401
01:32:14,207 --> 01:32:16,630
- Break, break, break, break!
- Yes!

1402
01:32:16,710 --> 01:32:17,757
Are you kidding me?

1403
01:32:18,587 --> 01:32:19,634
Yes!

1404
01:32:19,713 --> 01:32:22,091
Do it once, it's a fluke.
Do it twice, and it's something else.

1405
01:32:22,174 --> 01:32:25,474
Pull the bandwagon over,
I think I am hopping on.

1406
01:32:25,802 --> 01:32:27,145
I think I'm a believer.

1407
01:32:27,554 --> 01:32:30,057
You did it! Way to go, Brendan!

1408
01:32:30,223 --> 01:32:31,770
- I'm doing this!
- Okay.

1409
01:32:31,850 --> 01:32:33,067
- I'm doing it!
- Okay.

1410
01:32:33,143 --> 01:32:34,360
Okay, Son.

1411
01:32:35,020 --> 01:32:38,024
The crowd catching fire
for the hero Tommy Riordan.

1412
01:32:39,566 --> 01:32:41,318
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1413
01:32:41,401 --> 01:32:44,029
He doesn't seem to want
anything to do with all this adulation.

1414
01:32:44,112 --> 01:32:45,830
He's just here to fight.

1415
01:32:45,906 --> 01:32:48,375
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1416
01:32:48,450 --> 01:32:49,918
Gentlemen, you ready?

1417
01:32:50,827 --> 01:32:51,999
Are you ready?

1418
01:32:52,078 --> 01:32:54,297
- Let's go to war!
- Right at him! Right at him! Right at him!

1419
01:32:55,332 --> 01:32:57,505
Well, here he comes again like a buzz saw!

1420
01:33:00,545 --> 01:33:03,344
- Yeah.
- He is all over Diego Santana.

1421
01:33:05,717 --> 01:33:08,596
He's swarming all over him,
and now he's beating on him without mercy!

1422
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:09,721
Oh, my goodness!

1423
01:33:18,271 --> 01:33:21,400
There he goes again,
storming out of the cage!

1424
01:33:21,483 --> 01:33:24,327
Tommy Riordan marching off
through the crowd

1425
01:33:24,402 --> 01:33:28,077
and straight into the final four,
ladies and gentlemen.

1426
01:33:28,156 --> 01:33:30,784
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1427
01:33:57,477 --> 01:33:59,696
- So where is he?
- Yeah. Mr. Conlon.

1428
01:34:00,397 --> 01:34:02,024
Make a right at that white sign...

1429
01:34:11,533 --> 01:34:14,332
Hey! Can't sleep, huh?

1430
01:34:21,459 --> 01:34:24,838
I know that that other thing is

1431
01:34:27,299 --> 01:34:29,893
bothering the hell out of you.

1432
01:34:31,303 --> 01:34:33,476
I'm proud of you, Tommy.

1433
01:34:34,389 --> 01:34:37,063
What you did for that kid in the tank,

1434
01:34:37,809 --> 01:34:39,857
that was really something.

1435
01:34:42,981 --> 01:34:45,109
How about deserting my unit?

1436
01:34:46,651 --> 01:34:48,870
Is that really something, too?

1437
01:34:51,990 --> 01:34:53,242
Yeah.

1438
01:34:54,034 --> 01:34:58,039
I was on my way out of the country
when I came across those guys.

1439
01:34:58,872 --> 01:35:00,670
What was I supposed to do?
Let them drown?

1440
01:35:00,749 --> 01:35:01,875
No.

1441
01:35:05,086 --> 01:35:07,464
- What did you do?
- What did I do?

1442
01:35:10,216 --> 01:35:11,684
I took off.

1443
01:35:15,221 --> 01:35:17,440
That's why you go by Riordan.

1444
01:35:18,767 --> 01:35:21,896
That's why they can't
find your service records.

1445
01:35:25,190 --> 01:35:27,989
What the hell happened over there, Tommy?

1446
01:35:29,194 --> 01:35:31,037
That is none of your business, man.

1447
01:35:31,112 --> 01:35:33,956
Come on, kiddo. You know, I've been there.

1448
01:35:34,032 --> 01:35:36,501
I've done it, I've seen it.

1449
01:35:36,576 --> 01:35:38,169
You can trust me. I understand.

1450
01:35:38,244 --> 01:35:41,293
Will you spare me the
compassionate father routine, Pop?

1451
01:35:42,582 --> 01:35:44,425
The suit don't fit.

1452
01:35:45,251 --> 01:35:46,423
Tommy.

1453
01:35:47,337 --> 01:35:49,385
I'm really trying here.

1454
01:35:50,298 --> 01:35:52,972
- You're trying?
- Yeah, really. I'm trying.

1455
01:35:53,093 --> 01:35:54,219
Now?

1456
01:35:56,888 --> 01:35:59,232
Where were you when it mattered?

1457
01:36:00,308 --> 01:36:04,279
I needed this guy back when I was a kid.
I don't need you now.

1458
01:36:05,021 --> 01:36:08,446
You know, it's too late now.
Everything's already happened.

1459
01:36:09,442 --> 01:36:12,537
You and Brendan
don't seem to understand that.

1460
01:36:13,238 --> 01:36:16,162
Let me explain something to you, okay?

1461
01:36:16,241 --> 01:36:19,541
The only thing that I have in common
with Brendan Conlon

1462
01:36:19,619 --> 01:36:21,496
is that the pair of us,

1463
01:36:22,664 --> 01:36:25,383
we have absolutely no use for you.

1464
01:36:29,921 --> 01:36:31,298
Look at you.

1465
01:36:32,549 --> 01:36:35,098
Yeah, I was right.

1466
01:36:35,802 --> 01:36:37,896
I think I liked you better
when you were a drunk.

1467
01:36:37,971 --> 01:36:40,099
At least you had some balls then,
not like now,

1468
01:36:40,181 --> 01:36:44,357
tiptoeing around,
like some beggar with your cup out.

1469
01:36:47,147 --> 01:36:49,366
Take it somewhere else.
In fact, you know what?

1470
01:36:49,441 --> 01:36:50,488
Here's a cup.

1471
01:36:50,567 --> 01:36:53,946
Why don't you take this and go get yourself
some more of your shitty tapes...

1472
01:36:54,028 --> 01:36:55,905
- Don't do this, Tommy.
- ...and you go back to the room

1473
01:36:55,989 --> 01:36:57,662
- and you listen to some more...
- Don't do this.

1474
01:36:57,741 --> 01:37:01,245
Fish stories that no one gives a shit about.
Now get out of here.

1475
01:37:02,996 --> 01:37:05,340
Get the fuck out of here! Go on.

1476
01:37:44,621 --> 01:37:46,168
God pity them!

1477
01:37:46,748 --> 01:37:49,251
All shall perish except me!

1478
01:37:53,254 --> 01:37:56,804
Bastards. Bastards!

1479
01:37:58,051 --> 01:38:01,055
You bastards. You bastards!

1480
01:38:01,471 --> 01:38:04,645
Stop the ship, you bastards!

1481
01:38:04,724 --> 01:38:07,068
Ishmael. God pity them.

1482
01:38:07,769 --> 01:38:11,194
Stop the ship. Please, stop the ship.

1483
01:38:13,399 --> 01:38:15,993
Stop the ship! Somebody.

1484
01:38:17,403 --> 01:38:18,746
Ahab.

1485
01:38:19,447 --> 01:38:21,916
You godless son of a bitch!

1486
01:38:21,991 --> 01:38:23,868
You stop the ship!

1487
01:38:23,952 --> 01:38:27,081
You godless son of a bitch!

1488
01:38:27,705 --> 01:38:31,175
"'The whale! The ship! '
cried the cringing oarsmen.

1489
01:38:31,251 --> 01:38:33,253
"'Oars! Oars! Slope downward...

1490
01:38:33,336 --> 01:38:34,553
Stop it.

1491
01:38:34,754 --> 01:38:37,303
”'O sea that ere it be for ever too late,

1492
01:38:37,382 --> 01:38:40,807
"%\hab may slide this last,
last time upon his mark!"'

1493
01:38:42,595 --> 01:38:44,017
Captain...

1494
01:38:45,223 --> 01:38:47,146
Stop the...

1495
01:38:47,225 --> 01:38:49,523
Captain, stop...

1496
01:38:49,602 --> 01:38:51,946
Stop the ship, Ahab.

1497
01:38:53,439 --> 01:38:55,441
For the love of God.

1498
01:38:56,568 --> 01:38:58,161
They're lost.

1499
01:38:59,195 --> 01:39:01,118
Stop it... The ship.

1500
01:39:05,118 --> 01:39:06,335
Ahab...

1501
01:39:09,497 --> 01:39:11,124
You stop the...

1502
01:39:15,545 --> 01:39:17,092
Oh, no.

1503
01:39:21,551 --> 01:39:23,599
- Come on, give me the Walkman.
- No.

1504
01:39:23,678 --> 01:39:25,897
- No, no.
- Come on.

1505
01:39:25,972 --> 01:39:27,849
Come on, come on.
Come, give me the bottle.

1506
01:39:27,932 --> 01:39:29,900
Come here, come here, come here.

1507
01:39:29,976 --> 01:39:32,320
- Come on. Give me.
- No.

1508
01:39:42,614 --> 01:39:43,957
Tommy.

1509
01:39:44,949 --> 01:39:46,667
We're lost.

1510
01:39:48,411 --> 01:39:50,163
We're lost, Tommy.

1511
01:39:51,831 --> 01:39:54,960
It's over. We'll never make it back.

1512
01:39:56,836 --> 01:39:59,555
- Stay down.
- We'll never make it back.

1513
01:40:10,475 --> 01:40:11,727
I'm here.

1514
01:40:17,398 --> 01:40:19,196
I always loved you.

1515
01:40:21,361 --> 01:40:23,739
You know that, don't you, Tommy?

1516
01:40:24,530 --> 01:40:26,328
I always loved you.

1517
01:40:27,867 --> 01:40:31,246
You and your brother. My two boys.

1518
01:40:46,761 --> 01:40:50,061
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1519
01:41:03,611 --> 01:41:07,206
Tommy Riordan coming down the tunnel
without his trainer.

1520
01:41:12,203 --> 01:41:14,422
Once again, no walk-out music.

1521
01:41:17,583 --> 01:41:20,086
I'd hardly say no music, Sam.

1522
01:41:24,924 --> 01:41:28,144
Bryan, it sounds like V-J day
in Times Square.

1523
01:41:28,219 --> 01:41:30,221
I've never seen anything like this.

1524
01:41:47,488 --> 01:41:50,207
Tommy acknowledging his comrades
for the first time

1525
01:41:50,283 --> 01:41:52,456
and climbing into the cage.

1526
01:41:57,123 --> 01:41:59,376
Mad Dog Grimes has been
waiting for revenge

1527
01:41:59,459 --> 01:42:02,178
ever since the day Tommy Riordan
walked into his gym in Pittsburgh

1528
01:42:02,253 --> 01:42:04,096
and turned his life upside down.

1529
01:42:04,172 --> 01:42:07,893
It's been a very long and very miserable
few months for Mad Dog, to say the least.

1530
01:42:09,427 --> 01:42:13,898
Grimes mocking Riordan by having
a camouflage motif for his mohawk tonight,

1531
01:42:13,973 --> 01:42:17,273
and the Marines are really
letting Mad Dog have it.

1532
01:42:20,855 --> 01:42:22,323
All right, gentlemen.

1533
01:42:26,986 --> 01:42:28,533
All right, gentlemen,
we've been over your instructions.

1534
01:42:28,613 --> 01:42:29,910
I expect a clean fight.

1535
01:42:29,989 --> 01:42:32,913
Obey my commands at all times,
defend yourselves at all times.

1536
01:42:32,992 --> 01:42:34,869
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1537
01:42:34,952 --> 01:42:36,829
It's not gonna happen again.

1538
01:42:38,331 --> 01:42:41,961
Mad Dog chomping at the bit here.
He can't wait to get a piece of Tommy.

1539
01:42:42,043 --> 01:42:43,465
He predicted an early knockout.

1540
01:42:43,544 --> 01:42:46,263
He said he was gonna
take Tommy out with one punch.

1541
01:42:46,339 --> 01:42:48,888
And by the way, he said,
"They're gonna have to pull me off him."

1542
01:42:48,966 --> 01:42:51,845
We'll see what Tommy has to say about that.

1543
01:42:53,346 --> 01:42:54,848
Gentlemen, you ready?

1544
01:42:55,473 --> 01:42:56,690
You ready?

1545
01:42:58,601 --> 01:43:00,820
- Let's go to war!
- Here they go and they are off!

1546
01:43:02,355 --> 01:43:04,778
Tommy tackles him, and he's on top!

1547
01:43:04,857 --> 01:43:06,530
He's raining bombs!

1548
01:43:06,859 --> 01:43:09,032
- Cover up!
- Come on, work it.

1549
01:43:10,113 --> 01:43:11,740
- Raining bombs.
- Mad Dog is out.

1550
01:43:11,823 --> 01:43:13,951
Mad Dog's in trouble. Please stop this.

1551
01:43:14,033 --> 01:43:15,535
Stop it! Stop the fight!

1552
01:43:17,537 --> 01:43:19,585
Break! Break! Break!

1553
01:43:22,333 --> 01:43:24,131
That's the fastest knockout I think
I've ever experienced!

1554
01:43:24,210 --> 01:43:27,680
Mad Dog Grimes has been poleaxed.
He is not moving.

1555
01:43:29,465 --> 01:43:33,186
You do that to someone on the street,
they lock you up and throw away the key.

1556
01:43:33,261 --> 01:43:34,854
Break out the yellow tape, Sam.

1557
01:43:34,929 --> 01:43:37,682
This guy's walking away from the cage
like he's leaving a crime scene!

1558
01:43:37,765 --> 01:43:40,939
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1559
01:43:46,691 --> 01:43:49,570
- Everybody through. Come on, move it out.
- Sparta!

1560
01:44:00,705 --> 01:44:02,503
Yeah!

1561
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:06,002
Mr. C! Mr. C!

1562
01:44:06,085 --> 01:44:07,507
I'm on your side.

1563
01:44:16,596 --> 01:44:18,098
Let's go.

1564
01:44:18,389 --> 01:44:21,233
- Principal Zito, there he is.
- Nice.

1565
01:44:25,271 --> 01:44:26,944
Let's go, Brendan.

1566
01:44:30,276 --> 01:44:33,906
Brendan Conlon came into this tournament
as 1,000-to-one underdog,

1567
01:44:33,988 --> 01:44:36,207
and now here he is in the final four.

1568
01:44:36,282 --> 01:44:39,877
The crowd snowing their appreciation.
He's getting quite the reception.

1569
01:44:39,952 --> 01:44:43,877
He's got a huge reception.
I mean, this guy shocked everybody.

1570
01:44:45,124 --> 01:44:47,092
Come on, come on. You all right?

1571
01:44:49,503 --> 01:44:51,346
You've got a visitor.

1572
01:44:53,549 --> 01:44:55,517
Second row, 10 o'clock.

1573
01:45:03,976 --> 01:45:05,228
You all right with that?

1574
01:45:10,149 --> 01:45:11,196
I love you.

1575
01:45:14,654 --> 01:45:16,873
And here comes the great Russian, Koba.

1576
01:45:16,948 --> 01:45:20,669
Koba is so intimidating
and his reputation is larger than life.

1577
01:45:20,743 --> 01:45:23,997
- Koba! Koba!
- Koba! Koba!

1578
01:45:29,293 --> 01:45:32,763
I want you to look right at him
when he comes in here. Look right at him.

1579
01:45:32,838 --> 01:45:35,557
All right? Don't take your eyes off him.

1580
01:46:03,035 --> 01:46:05,083
I'm proud of you, brother.

1581
01:46:05,705 --> 01:46:07,423
This is your cage.

1582
01:46:19,218 --> 01:46:20,640
Gentlemen.

1583
01:46:28,561 --> 01:46:30,108
All right, gentlemen,
we've been over your instructions.

1584
01:46:30,187 --> 01:46:31,655
I expect a clean fight.

1585
01:46:31,731 --> 01:46:34,484
Obey my commands at all times,
defend yourselves at all times.

1586
01:46:34,567 --> 01:46:37,116
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1587
01:46:40,990 --> 01:46:43,664
Should I be nervous for Brendan?
'Cause I am.

1588
01:46:43,743 --> 01:46:45,916
I wanna stop the fight
before it even gets going.

1589
01:46:45,995 --> 01:46:49,090
- Well, here we go.
- He's like a machine. Look at him.

1590
01:46:51,751 --> 01:46:53,424
Gentlemen, you ready?

1591
01:46:53,919 --> 01:46:55,637
You ready? Let's go to war!

1592
01:46:55,713 --> 01:46:57,215
Keep your hands up, Brendan. Hands up.

1593
01:46:57,298 --> 01:47:01,223
But now, the question is, how long
can Brendan Conlon stay alive?

1594
01:47:01,427 --> 01:47:02,599
Angle out of it!

1595
01:47:04,597 --> 01:47:06,099
Keep moving!

1596
01:47:07,683 --> 01:47:10,186
Get out of there! Get out of there!

1597
01:47:14,440 --> 01:47:16,693
Keep moving! Keep moving!
Get away from him!

1598
01:47:16,776 --> 01:47:18,494
Hit him, babe! Hit him! Get in there!

1599
01:47:20,571 --> 01:47:22,619
- Crushing body shots.
- Relax, you're okay.

1600
01:47:22,698 --> 01:47:24,621
Conlon's down,
and Koba pounces and starts pounding!

1601
01:47:24,700 --> 01:47:26,077
Get up! Get up!

1602
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:28,128
He's just pounding on him
like a side of beef.

1603
01:47:28,371 --> 01:47:29,748
Go, go, go. Get up!

1604
01:47:30,706 --> 01:47:31,753
He's getting his ass whooped.

1605
01:47:34,585 --> 01:47:36,053
And now he's got him in the air!

1606
01:47:36,128 --> 01:47:37,801
Oh, God.

1607
01:47:37,880 --> 01:47:40,133
Relax, tie up his arm! Tie him up!

1608
01:47:43,803 --> 01:47:46,147
I think Campana has to think
seriously about...

1609
01:47:46,222 --> 01:47:48,566
- How much abuse can one man take?
- ...continuing another round of this.

1610
01:47:48,641 --> 01:47:49,767
Go to war!

1611
01:47:53,646 --> 01:47:57,321
Just relax! Relax! Relax! Off the fence!

1612
01:47:58,526 --> 01:48:01,655
Brendan's going for a ride!

1613
01:48:01,737 --> 01:48:04,331
That one shook the entire building!

1614
01:48:05,991 --> 01:48:08,369
Man, he just threw him against the fence
like a rag doll.

1615
01:48:08,452 --> 01:48:12,252
Get up! Get up! Come on!
Hold on! Turn it in! Turn in!

1616
01:48:12,331 --> 01:48:14,049
And now he's on top! Koba's on top,

1617
01:48:14,125 --> 01:48:17,095
and he's finishing him, here. Look at this.
On the edge of blowing it.

1618
01:48:17,169 --> 01:48:19,092
Get off the fence, Brendan!

1619
01:48:19,171 --> 01:48:21,845
You wonder how Conlon can
take this kind of beating on his arms.

1620
01:48:21,924 --> 01:48:25,019
- His forearms and his hands.
- Drop that neck!

1621
01:48:25,094 --> 01:48:26,596
How much can one man take?

1622
01:48:27,513 --> 01:48:28,981
Break! Break! Break!

1623
01:48:31,267 --> 01:48:33,486
Everybody has got to be
a little bit concerned

1624
01:48:33,561 --> 01:48:36,314
about Brendan Conlon's bravery
getting him in trouble here.

1625
01:48:36,397 --> 01:48:38,365
His bravery could get him killed, frankly.

1626
01:48:38,441 --> 01:48:40,614
And by the way,
he's got nothing more to prove.

1627
01:48:40,693 --> 01:48:42,491
- He's lasted two rounds with Koba
- That's true, that's true.

1628
01:48:42,570 --> 01:48:44,698
And you wonder what's keeping this guy up.

1629
01:48:45,823 --> 01:48:47,746
Sit down. Sit down.

1630
01:48:48,868 --> 01:48:50,495
Breathe. Breathe!

1631
01:48:51,203 --> 01:48:53,331
Look at me. Look at me!

1632
01:48:53,414 --> 01:48:56,714
Wait up. Small sips. Hold it.
Hold it, small sips.

1633
01:48:59,753 --> 01:49:02,131
Why are we here?
Why are we here, Brendan?

1634
01:49:02,214 --> 01:49:03,682
Why are we here?
Are we here to win this fight?

1635
01:49:03,757 --> 01:49:05,009
Are we here to win this fight?

1636
01:49:05,092 --> 01:49:07,766
You tell me.
'Cause if we're not, I will throw in the towel.

1637
01:49:07,845 --> 01:49:09,813
We will get Tess and we will go home.

1638
01:49:09,889 --> 01:49:11,891
We'll go home, okay?

1639
01:49:12,641 --> 01:49:14,894
You don't knock him out, you lose the fight.

1640
01:49:15,144 --> 01:49:16,942
Do you understand me?

1641
01:49:17,730 --> 01:49:20,779
You don't knock him out,
you don't have a home.

1642
01:49:21,233 --> 01:49:23,235
Let's go! Seconds out! Seconds out!

1643
01:49:42,421 --> 01:49:44,765
Gentlemen! Let's go to war!

1644
01:49:49,053 --> 01:49:52,478
Conlon somehow
answering the call to round three.

1645
01:49:52,556 --> 01:49:54,979
And Koba's all over him once again.

1646
01:49:58,062 --> 01:49:59,279
Brendan's giving back, Bryan.

1647
01:49:59,355 --> 01:50:01,198
I mean, there's signs of life
in Brendan Conlon.

1648
01:50:01,815 --> 01:50:03,613
He's starting to mix it up.

1649
01:50:11,742 --> 01:50:13,119
Pummel, pummel, pummel.

1650
01:50:15,913 --> 01:50:18,291
He's taking Koba down,
but the Russian's back up.

1651
01:50:19,083 --> 01:50:20,881
Brendan shoots him again,
pressing him against the cage.

1652
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:23,713
- Yes!
- Whoa, he's fallen deep into a guillotine.

1653
01:50:23,796 --> 01:50:25,673
Well, Conlon trapped in an iron vice here,

1654
01:50:25,756 --> 01:50:27,724
and Koba now squeezing his neck
for all it's worth,

1655
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:28,801
trying to choke the teacher out.

1656
01:50:28,884 --> 01:50:31,728
Hips, hips, hips! Breathe! Breathe!

1657
01:50:31,804 --> 01:50:33,806
Ride it out! Ride it out!

1658
01:50:34,723 --> 01:50:36,396
Conlon looking for a way out.

1659
01:50:36,475 --> 01:50:39,319
- What is this?
- Just tossed Koba. Can you believe this?

1660
01:50:39,395 --> 01:50:42,069
He just shook off a guillotine
and tossed Koba.

1661
01:50:42,147 --> 01:50:44,366
Conlon's looking for an armbar.
He's looking for that armbar,

1662
01:50:44,441 --> 01:50:46,990
- and he's trying to submit the Russian bear.
- Hips, hips, hips!

1663
01:50:47,069 --> 01:50:48,446
Yeah, you got him!
You got him! You got him!

1664
01:50:49,071 --> 01:50:50,869
Koba slips right out.

1665
01:50:51,407 --> 01:50:54,331
Conlon's staying after him.
He's squeezing the bear.

1666
01:50:54,660 --> 01:50:58,130
The tables have turned and the boy scout
is actually messing with the bear.

1667
01:50:58,205 --> 01:51:00,333
The teacher springing off the fence and
going for a mountain,

1668
01:51:00,416 --> 01:51:01,417
- but Koba's on his feet.
- Get up, get up!

1669
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:03,002
He does not want to be
on the ground with Brendan

1670
01:51:03,085 --> 01:51:05,087
and his endless bag of submissions.

1671
01:51:05,170 --> 01:51:08,595
Koba trying to reestablish his dominance
with brutal shots to the face.

1672
01:51:08,674 --> 01:51:11,598
But Conlon's showing no fear.
This is a fight!

1673
01:51:11,677 --> 01:51:13,930
We have got ourselves a fight!

1674
01:51:17,683 --> 01:51:19,936
Wow, that's a huge elbow to the head.

1675
01:51:20,019 --> 01:51:22,272
And now, Conlon goes for a knee bar.
He's got it very deep!

1676
01:51:22,354 --> 01:51:24,356
He's got it very, very deep!

1677
01:51:24,690 --> 01:51:25,782
He's deep on that.

1678
01:51:26,525 --> 01:51:27,947
He's got Koba in a lot of pain.

1679
01:51:28,027 --> 01:51:29,825
We saw this with Midnight,
we saw it against The Dane,

1680
01:51:29,903 --> 01:51:31,621
and we're seeing it here! Brendan Conlon...

1681
01:51:31,947 --> 01:51:34,496
Break it! Break it! Break it!

1682
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:36,622
Not letting out!

1683
01:51:36,702 --> 01:51:38,796
Conlon wrenching that knee
for all it's worth.

1684
01:51:38,871 --> 01:51:40,623
He's putting everything he has into it.

1685
01:51:42,124 --> 01:51:44,468
And Koba is screaming in pain.

1686
01:51:44,543 --> 01:51:45,544
Koba taps.

1687
01:51:45,628 --> 01:51:48,051
Koba has tapped!
Brendan Conlon has tapped Koba!

1688
01:51:48,130 --> 01:51:51,930
I can't believe it!
Brendan Conlon has tapped Koba!

1689
01:51:52,009 --> 01:51:54,603
He's tapped Koba!

1690
01:51:54,678 --> 01:51:57,431
And Frank Campana can't believe it.

1691
01:51:57,514 --> 01:52:00,063
This whole place can't believe it.
I can't believe it.

1692
01:52:00,142 --> 01:52:03,362
Brendan Conlon has tapped the great Koba.

1693
01:52:04,021 --> 01:52:07,571
- Tess!
- You got it! You did it!

1694
01:52:07,650 --> 01:52:10,950
Brendan taps the world Sambo
champ with a knee bar!

1695
01:52:11,028 --> 01:52:12,655
- Babe, you did it!
- Brendan Conlon!

1696
01:52:12,738 --> 01:52:15,491
- I don't know what to say. It's amazing!
- I don't know what I just saw.

1697
01:52:15,574 --> 01:52:17,747
I just don't know
how to put this into context.

1698
01:52:17,826 --> 01:52:20,670
That's gotta be the biggest upset
in MMA history.

1699
01:52:20,746 --> 01:52:22,840
I have never seen anything like this.

1700
01:52:22,915 --> 01:52:26,385
He tapped a world Sambo champion
in a knee bar!

1701
01:52:28,212 --> 01:52:31,512
Brendan Conlon has tapped the great Koba!

1702
01:52:31,590 --> 01:52:35,436
Brendan Conlon, the physics teacher!
Brendan Conlon, the civilian!

1703
01:52:35,636 --> 01:52:37,684
He's done the impossible.

1704
01:52:37,763 --> 01:52:41,233
He has done the impossible.
He's pulled off a miracle.

1705
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:45,446
This place is going crazy
because they've just seen a miracle.

1706
01:52:57,241 --> 01:52:59,744
This is CNN Breaking News.

1707
01:53:00,452 --> 01:53:04,207
A surprising turn in the story
of Iraq War hero, Tommy Riordan.

1708
01:53:04,790 --> 01:53:07,794
CNN has learned that Riordan's true identity

1709
01:53:07,876 --> 01:53:10,720
is that of Marine Staff Sergeant
Thomas Conlon,

1710
01:53:10,796 --> 01:53:13,675
who went AWOL from his unit
earlier this year,

1711
01:53:13,757 --> 01:53:16,636
following the friendly fire death
of his brother-in-arms,

1712
01:53:16,719 --> 01:53:18,096
Sergeant Manny Fernandez.

1713
01:53:18,429 --> 01:53:21,308
Fernandez's wife, Pilar Fernandez,
spoke with me

1714
01:53:21,390 --> 01:53:24,018
in an exclusive interview, moments ago.

1715
01:53:24,643 --> 01:53:26,611
The bombs started dropping.

1716
01:53:27,354 --> 01:53:30,233
They were coming from US planes.

1717
01:53:30,315 --> 01:53:34,161
Tommy and Manny were waving their Hags

1718
01:53:35,112 --> 01:53:37,581
to let them know they were Americans,

1719
01:53:37,656 --> 01:53:39,283
but they didn't stop.

1720
01:53:40,826 --> 01:53:42,328
Everyone died.

1721
01:53:43,036 --> 01:53:44,959
Everyone except Tommy.

1722
01:53:45,789 --> 01:53:49,259
And, you know, my Manny used to say,

1723
01:53:52,004 --> 01:53:54,507
that Tommy was the brother he never had.

1724
01:53:55,174 --> 01:53:59,145
Conlon, who is fighting in the mixed
martial arts mega tournament, Sparta,

1725
01:53:59,219 --> 01:54:02,598
is expected to be taken into custody
by military police,

1726
01:54:02,681 --> 01:54:05,810
following tonight's winner-take-all finale
in Atlantic City.

1727
01:54:05,893 --> 01:54:10,273
If victorious, he has pledged
his $5 million purse

1728
01:54:10,355 --> 01:54:12,232
to the widow of his fallen comrade.

1729
01:54:13,942 --> 01:54:15,944
We've just got some incredible news,

1730
01:54:16,028 --> 01:54:18,702
that I'm having trouble
putting into context, but here it is.

1731
01:54:19,031 --> 01:54:22,956
The two men
fighting for the championship tonight,

1732
01:54:23,035 --> 01:54:25,208
for the $5 million prize,

1733
01:54:25,329 --> 01:54:28,799
for the middleweight championship
of the world,

1734
01:54:28,874 --> 01:54:30,376
are brothers.

1735
01:54:56,568 --> 01:54:58,821
All right, let's get this off.

1736
01:55:16,046 --> 01:55:17,923
What are you gonna do?

1737
01:55:22,803 --> 01:55:24,555
I'm gonna fight him.

1738
01:56:35,375 --> 01:56:38,845
- Mr. C, Mr. C!
- Mr. C, Mr. C!

1739
01:57:24,591 --> 01:57:27,765
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1740
01:58:26,111 --> 01:58:27,454
Gentlemen.

1741
01:58:34,286 --> 01:58:36,709
Gentlemen, this is the final.
I expect a clean fight.

1742
01:58:36,788 --> 01:58:39,883
Obey my commands at all times,
defend yourselves at all times.

1743
01:58:39,958 --> 01:58:41,756
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1744
01:58:41,835 --> 01:58:43,257
Where's Pop?

1745
01:59:03,648 --> 01:59:05,650
Gentlemen, are you ready?

1746
01:59:06,902 --> 01:59:08,324
Are you ready?

1747
01:59:09,654 --> 01:59:10,826
Let's go to war!

1748
01:59:22,876 --> 01:59:24,844
Relax, Brendan, relax!

1749
01:59:28,882 --> 01:59:30,509
Get out! Get out of there!

1750
01:59:32,010 --> 01:59:33,683
Throw your hands!

1751
01:59:34,971 --> 01:59:36,939
Throw your hands!

1752
01:59:37,015 --> 01:59:39,109
Don't lose it. No, no, no!

1753
01:59:39,184 --> 01:59:40,686
Move! Move!

1754
01:59:42,854 --> 01:59:46,028
Tie him up! Tie him up!
Control his moves. Control his moves.

1755
01:59:46,441 --> 01:59:48,910
Control the arms!
Keep control in the arms! Breathe!

1756
01:59:49,444 --> 01:59:52,368
You're okay! Relax! Breathe!

1757
01:59:58,203 --> 02:00:00,376
Get up! Get up! Get up!

1758
02:00:00,455 --> 02:00:02,378
Relax! Breathe!

1759
02:00:02,707 --> 02:00:05,631
Tie him up! Get up!
Tie him up, Brendan! Tie him up!

1760
02:00:06,336 --> 02:00:07,713
Come on. Get him! Get him! Get him!

1761
02:00:08,713 --> 02:00:10,056
Break!

1762
02:00:10,298 --> 02:00:11,550
What was that?

1763
02:00:11,633 --> 02:00:13,055
Hey, come on, Josh!

1764
02:00:13,301 --> 02:00:14,393
What's up with that?

1765
02:00:14,719 --> 02:00:16,471
Hey, step back!

1766
02:00:16,555 --> 02:00:18,102
Watch that late blow!

1767
02:00:18,807 --> 02:00:20,059
Come on!

1768
02:00:28,233 --> 02:00:30,156
Come on, Josh! I mean, what is that?

1769
02:00:30,235 --> 02:00:32,408
Come on, come on. Sit down. Sit, sit, sit.

1770
02:00:32,487 --> 02:00:34,285
Sit... Brendan, sit down.

1771
02:00:34,364 --> 02:00:36,458
Look at me. Sit down.

1772
02:00:37,075 --> 02:00:39,248
Brendan, look at me. Look at me.

1773
02:00:40,453 --> 02:00:44,833
Look at me, Brendan. Let it go.
Let it go, okay?

1774
02:00:44,916 --> 02:00:47,465
Breathe. Beethoven.

1775
02:00:48,086 --> 02:00:51,465
Okay. He's coming right at you, right?
Exactly like we planned.

1776
02:00:51,548 --> 02:00:54,677
I want you to angle out,
hit and move every time. All right?

1777
02:00:54,759 --> 02:00:56,056
- Angle out and move.
- Good.

1778
02:00:56,136 --> 02:00:58,605
Breathe. Breathe. Come on, relax.

1779
02:01:00,682 --> 02:01:03,526
- Okay. He's not your brother, right?
- Time's up!

1780
02:01:03,602 --> 02:01:05,445
Look at me. He's not your brother, right?

1781
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:06,612
- All right.
- He's in the way.

1782
02:01:06,730 --> 02:01:09,074
Seconds out. Wrap it up.

1783
02:01:09,149 --> 02:01:11,572
Taking a little more time for the cheap shot.

1784
02:01:14,112 --> 02:01:15,955
Do your job, Josh.

1785
02:01:21,077 --> 02:01:22,454
Come on, babe. Come on.

1786
02:01:22,621 --> 02:01:24,214
Let's go to war.

1787
02:01:24,289 --> 02:01:25,290
Breathe!

1788
02:01:30,462 --> 02:01:32,681
Pace, pace! Control the pace!

1789
02:01:42,974 --> 02:01:43,975
Cover up!

1790
02:01:44,893 --> 02:01:47,237
Come on, get off the fence!

1791
02:01:47,312 --> 02:01:48,484
Get off the fence!

1792
02:01:49,314 --> 02:01:50,531
Hands up! Hands up!

1793
02:01:51,983 --> 02:01:54,907
Head up! You're all right! Relax! Breathe!

1794
02:01:56,905 --> 02:01:57,997
Yeah!

1795
02:02:04,496 --> 02:02:05,497
Get him!

1796
02:02:08,500 --> 02:02:11,549
- Huge throw. Huge.
- Look at that.

1797
02:02:11,628 --> 02:02:13,255
Turn in! Don't give him your back!

1798
02:02:13,338 --> 02:02:15,011
Turn in! Go! Good! Good!

1799
02:02:18,134 --> 02:02:20,262
Come on, get out of it! Go! Get up!

1800
02:02:21,805 --> 02:02:23,227
Control the arms! Control the arms!

1801
02:02:25,600 --> 02:02:28,149
Cover up, cover up. Push it!

1802
02:02:29,854 --> 02:02:31,356
Break free! Break! Break!

1803
02:02:33,108 --> 02:02:35,987
Good, good, good!
Clean break! Stop! Hey, stop!

1804
02:02:36,069 --> 02:02:37,696
- Come on.
- Here we go, mom.

1805
02:02:37,779 --> 02:02:41,329
Time to lock up your china,
the boys are at it again!

1806
02:02:47,289 --> 02:02:48,381
Let's go to war!

1807
02:03:06,349 --> 02:03:08,272
Now! Get up! Get up!

1808
02:03:09,269 --> 02:03:10,816
Get up! Come on, babe!
Get up! Get up! Get up!

1809
02:03:10,895 --> 02:03:12,738
Control it! Control it with the arms.

1810
02:03:12,814 --> 02:03:14,361
Switch! Switch!

1811
02:03:16,484 --> 02:03:17,827
Hips!

1812
02:03:18,361 --> 02:03:20,113
Down, down. Hips down.

1813
02:03:23,908 --> 02:03:27,162
Oh, my God. That's a deep omoplata there.
He's got the seats up.

1814
02:03:28,580 --> 02:03:30,253
Come on, Tommy!

1815
02:03:35,045 --> 02:03:37,343
You've got him, babe! You've got him, babe!
Come on, tap him out!

1816
02:03:38,089 --> 02:03:39,215
Tom!

1817
02:03:46,723 --> 02:03:47,975
Break! Break! Break!

1818
02:03:48,058 --> 02:03:50,607
Tommy, you okay?

1819
02:03:55,106 --> 02:03:57,609
- Tommy!
- Go! Let's go! Go!

1820
02:03:57,692 --> 02:03:59,114
Calm down. Calm down.

1821
02:04:00,153 --> 02:04:02,702
- It's the championship. Keep it together.
- All right. All right. I got it.

1822
02:04:02,781 --> 02:04:04,283
Sit down. Sit down!

1823
02:04:11,748 --> 02:04:13,546
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1824
02:04:13,625 --> 02:04:16,845
- I popped his shoulder.
- Relax. Breathe. Breathe.

1825
02:04:16,920 --> 02:04:18,547
- I heard it tear.
- You popped his shoulder?

1826
02:04:18,630 --> 02:04:19,677
- Yeah.
- Good. Okay.

1827
02:04:19,756 --> 02:04:22,384
I want you to pop his other shoulder.
Let's go.

1828
02:04:22,467 --> 02:04:24,344
- Josh.
- Hey, hey, no Josh.

1829
02:04:24,427 --> 02:04:25,553
- Josh.
- Hey!

1830
02:04:25,637 --> 02:04:27,059
- Look at me. Look at me.
- What?

1831
02:04:27,138 --> 02:04:28,936
All right, you got two rounds. Two rounds.

1832
02:04:29,015 --> 02:04:30,312
We need both rounds.

1833
02:04:33,061 --> 02:04:34,153
What?

1834
02:04:34,229 --> 02:04:37,324
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1835
02:04:43,863 --> 02:04:46,992
Go in there, you kick him in the head,
take him down and finish him!

1836
02:04:54,582 --> 02:04:56,960
Tommy, what are you doing?

1837
02:04:57,710 --> 02:04:59,337
Shut up. Come on.

1838
02:05:00,296 --> 02:05:01,764
Stand back.

1839
02:05:02,507 --> 02:05:05,636
Come on. What? Have you gone crazy?

1840
02:05:07,137 --> 02:05:08,810
Let's go to war!

1841
02:05:10,181 --> 02:05:12,525
Brendan, pick your hands up!

1842
02:05:13,226 --> 02:05:14,478
It's over.

1843
02:05:15,687 --> 02:05:18,361
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1844
02:05:19,858 --> 02:05:21,531
It's over, Tommy.

1845
02:05:21,776 --> 02:05:22,777
You better fight!

1846
02:05:33,705 --> 02:05:35,799
It's over, Tommy. Come on.

1847
02:05:39,919 --> 02:05:42,297
Tommy, we don't have to do this.

1848
02:05:54,100 --> 02:05:56,694
Come on.
Why do you want to do this, Tommy?

1849
02:05:57,020 --> 02:05:58,363
Am I gonna have to watch you do this?

1850
02:06:06,029 --> 02:06:08,282
Okay? You all right there?

1851
02:06:09,073 --> 02:06:10,416
Tommy!

1852
02:06:20,835 --> 02:06:23,338
Quick, finish him! You finish him!

1853
02:06:30,011 --> 02:06:31,388
Come on.

1854
02:06:42,148 --> 02:06:45,118
Break, break, break! Back up, back up!

02:08:42,644 --> 02:08:46,239
I'm sorry, Tommy. I'm sorry.

Tap, Tommy.

It's okay. It's okay.

I love you.
