1
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:10,043
She's denied the cross
for suicide...

2
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:13,609
and buried at the center
of a crossroads. Huh.

3
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:17,384
Show me the logic. Father?

4
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,391
What?

5
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:22,462
The devil is a practical man.

6
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:25,555
If she were a witch, she was
a poor return on his investment.

7
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,566
What would you know of logic?

8
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:32,901
Oh, I have ears, Father. Although
one is notched because I love justice.

9
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:34,998
You love thieving.

10
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:37,043
Shut up. You dig.

11
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:02,995
Crusaders.

12
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,900
Clear the road,
if you will.

13
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,700
- [Man] Squire!
- Hyah!

14
00:05:40,074 --> 00:05:42,338
This is for the burial
from my lord...

15
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:44,138
and a Mass...

16
00:05:44,245 --> 00:05:46,372
for her soul.

17
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:52,685
Wait.

18
00:05:52,787 --> 00:05:55,654
- Have you forgotten?
- She was your brother's wife.

19
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:57,656
She was a suicide.
Cut off her head.

20
00:05:57,758 --> 00:06:00,522
And return the ax.

21
00:06:15,343 --> 00:06:17,311
You know this place, my lord?

22
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:20,380
Know it?

23
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:22,574
I know all of it.

24
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:29,581
[Man] Your brother?
You have spoken to him?

25
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,352
On what matter, my lord?
He is still arrested.

26
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,453
Your brother is as responsible
for his wife's sin as I am.

27
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:38,964
Opinions differ, my lord.

28
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:42,331
- The burial was...
- Yes.

29
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:45,428
- And you did not mutilate the person?
- No.

30
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:49,339
Good. The law can go too far.

31
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:51,536
It can too far.
I ask myself...

32
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:54,113
"Would Jesus do it thusly?"

33
00:06:54,215 --> 00:06:57,946
There is so much done in Christendom
of which Christ would be incapable.

34
00:06:58,052 --> 00:07:00,486
You must release your brother.
I cannot do without him.

35
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:05,218
My-My brother, my lord bishop,
uh, is possessed by the devil...

36
00:07:05,326 --> 00:07:08,523
and must be... examined.

37
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:11,996
Your brother is as mad as you are.
He grieves.

38
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,124
Without your brother,
I cannot finish my church.

39
00:07:14,235 --> 00:07:16,863
Let him out.
And give him this.

40
00:07:16,971 --> 00:07:21,965
And tell him that he is at
the very center of my prayers.

41
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:17,622
The bishop needs you.

42
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:20,427
- Release him.
- On your feet.

43
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:24,300
[Man] This is not heaven.
It's the world.

44
00:08:24,405 --> 00:08:26,464
And there's troubles in it.

45
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:46,018
Do yourself no injury.

46
00:08:46,127 --> 00:08:48,755
Other men are always
good for that.

47
00:09:07,515 --> 00:09:10,643
- [Man] And what of Jerusalem?
- [Man #2] Jerusalem?

48
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:13,914
In peril, my lord, as always.

49
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:16,819
We have stood there against
the Saracens for over a hundred years.

50
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:20,690
The Saracens, as you call them,
have now unified in Egypt...

51
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:23,592
Syria and all Arabia.

52
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:25,722
Saracens and someone new.

53
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:29,098
- Saladin, the king.
- [Speaking Native Language]

54
00:09:29,203 --> 00:09:32,195
[Belches]
Gibberish.

55
00:09:34,175 --> 00:09:38,509
- Very fine.
- And yet, you do not drink.

56
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:40,580
A knight should be a knight...

57
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:42,911
- a monk a monk.
- Brother.

58
00:09:43,017 --> 00:09:45,713
Not both.
One, that's what I say.

59
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:51,189
Now I may be old-fashioned,
but, as for the cup...

60
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:55,353
I have, uh, an artificer,
uh, a blacksmith.

61
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:59,125
Or did have.

62
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:03,602
Which son of the blacksmith of my time
is the blacksmith now?

63
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:06,434
Balian, the eldest.

64
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,565
His child died.

65
00:10:08,676 --> 00:10:12,203
His wife fell into a melancholy.
She would not listen to reason.

66
00:10:12,313 --> 00:10:17,410
She killed herself...
it occurs.

67
00:10:17,518 --> 00:10:20,919
But what's that to you?

68
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:22,989
Private matter.

69
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:31,421
It's been six and 20 years
since my brother took the cross.

70
00:10:31,532 --> 00:10:37,164
Now he returns an actual baron
of the kingdom of Jerusalem.

71
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:39,899
How is that for the lot
of the younger brother?

72
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:44,603
With no heir, comes to me
and thus to you.

73
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:47,408
Then I thank the stars
for my uncle.

74
00:11:10,371 --> 00:11:12,396
Go on.

75
00:11:18,112 --> 00:11:20,945
Her grave was here.

76
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:23,949
Or was it there?
[Chuckles]

77
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:27,316
I'm afraid I can't tell you
the exact location.

78
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:29,753
I wasn't present at the burial.

79
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:34,726
Call me a liar.

80
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:37,126
You have reason.

81
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:43,203
You never fight back.

82
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:49,809
Hmm? Hmm?

83
00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:53,413
You always turn the other cheek.

84
00:11:53,514 --> 00:11:56,608
I think that you conceive
yourself without sin.

85
00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:59,910
That is a sin!

86
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:16,229
We shall work.

87
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:41,677
- [Children Chattering]
- [Woman] I told you to stop that now!

88
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:52,423
That is the man.
That is the man.

89
00:13:52,533 --> 00:13:55,093
You're an armorer, yes?

90
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:58,638
An artificer according to
your lord and this priest.

91
00:13:58,739 --> 00:14:01,640
You have my sympathy
and my blessing.

92
00:14:01,742 --> 00:14:06,236
Your dead wife and stillborn child are
today the subject of my prayers.

93
00:14:07,448 --> 00:14:10,008
We need all these horses shod.

94
00:14:10,117 --> 00:14:13,177
We need food, and we'll pay.

95
00:14:15,456 --> 00:14:17,390
Says yes.

96
00:14:17,491 --> 00:14:20,119
[Child] Have you killed any?
Have you killed any?

97
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,732
He has made great engines for sieges.

98
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:34,674
He has made war machines
that cast the largest stones.

99
00:14:34,775 --> 00:14:37,835
He also works finely in silver.

100
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:42,982
He will be one of the few on your journey
worth more alive than dead.

101
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,142
Shut up.

102
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,059
Have you been at war?

103
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:58,530
On horse.
And as an enginer also.

104
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:00,600
Against whom
and for whom did you fight?

105
00:15:00,701 --> 00:15:02,566
For one lord against another...

106
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:05,502
on a point which
cannot be remembered.

107
00:15:05,606 --> 00:15:09,098
There's better game now...
one god against another.

108
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:12,440
- The pay is proportionate.
- I've been telling him that.

109
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:06,825
Do you still advise what
you advised upon the road?

110
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,403
I do, my lord.

111
00:16:10,504 --> 00:16:14,463
But know that this man
Balian mourns his wife.

112
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:26,950
What does that say?

113
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:30,820
"What man is a man who does not
make the world better?"

114
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:32,892
Leave me with this man.

115
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:44,094
God has made us man.
We must suffer all.

116
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:47,432
I also have lost.

117
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:59,547
Some say Jerusalem is the very center
of the world for asking forgiveness.

118
00:16:59,653 --> 00:17:03,282
For myself, I call it here.

119
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,358
Now.

120
00:17:16,637 --> 00:17:18,798
I knew your namesake.

121
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:29,211
I knew your mother.

122
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:36,922
To be courteous, I should say
that it was against her objections.

123
00:17:37,024 --> 00:17:40,425
But I was the lord's brother
and she had no choice.

124
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:43,758
But I did not force her.

125
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:54,266
I have forgiveness
to ask of you.

126
00:18:13,627 --> 00:18:17,085
I am Godfrey,
the baron of Ibelin.

127
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:20,189
I have 100 men at arms
in Jerusalem.

128
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:24,202
If you will come with me,
you will have a living...

129
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:27,205
and... you will have my thanks.

130
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:29,366
There it is.

131
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:31,774
Whoever you are, my lord...

132
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:33,743
my place is here.

133
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:37,146
What made it your place
is now dead.

134
00:18:43,023 --> 00:18:45,856
You will never see me again.

135
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,587
If you want anything of me,
take it now.

136
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,898
I want nothing.

137
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:56,628
I am sorry for your troubles.
God protect you.

138
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,517
Jerusalem is easy to find.

139
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:22,754
You come to where
the men speak Italian...

140
00:19:22,863 --> 00:19:25,661
then continue until
they speak something else.

141
00:19:25,766 --> 00:19:29,133
We go by Messina.
Good-bye.

142
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,104
The village does not want you.

143
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:15,239
When the old lord is dead,
they will drive you out.

144
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:23,854
When the bishop is dead,
it is certain.

145
00:20:23,957 --> 00:20:26,050
And you take my property.

146
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,457
- The Church.
- You.

147
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:31,087
They would have taken you
to Jerusalem...

148
00:20:31,198 --> 00:20:34,395
away from... all this.

149
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:36,469
I arranged it.

150
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,940
I swear to you...

151
00:20:42,042 --> 00:20:45,500
you will have no peace
so long as you stay here.

152
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,077
No man ever needed
a new world more.

153
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:55,211
Imagine your sin
and pain erased.

154
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:57,882
All.

155
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:12,070
If you take the Crusade...

156
00:21:12,172 --> 00:21:15,266
you may relieve
your wife's position in hell.

157
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:20,369
I-I put it delicately...
She was a suicide. She is in hell.

158
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,874
Though what she does there
without a head...

159
00:22:44,264 --> 00:22:46,459
[Godfrey]
Wait here.

160
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:04,216
Have you come to kill me?

161
00:23:04,317 --> 00:23:08,048
Even these days,
it is not easy.

162

Is it true...

167
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,873
that in Jerusalem
I can erase my sins...

168

Is it true?

- Uncle.
- Nephew.

You have with you a man, Balian,
who killed a priest, his brother.

I'm charged by both my father
and the lord bishop to bring him back.

What he says is true.

They have the right to take me.

194

I say he is innocent of the charge.

195
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:54,377
If you say he's guilty, then we'll fight,
and God will decide the truth of it.

My German friend
is a close student of the law.

Just give him to me.
I'll fight you for something else.

198

Uncle, he's a murderer.

Ah. Well, you broke the arrow.

you'll take a fever and die.

what lies in the Holy Land?

A new world.

249
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:21,186
A man who, in France,
had not a house...

250
00:35:21,287 --> 00:35:24,450
is, in the Holy Land,
the master of a city.

He who was the master of a city

00:45:03,101 --> 00:45:05,035
Then you must
give him the horse.

325
00:45:10,909 --> 00:45:12,399
No.

326
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:27,490
Fight me fairly!

327
00:45:27,592 --> 00:45:29,856
- [Arabic]
- Why? Why should he?

328
00:45:29,961 --> 00:45:33,362
- He is a knight.
- And I am the baron of Ibelin.

329
00:45:41,306 --> 00:45:44,207
He says the baron of Ibelin is old.

330
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:46,869
He knew him at Damascus.

331
00:45:46,978 --> 00:45:48,946
I am the new one.

332
00:46:10,736 --> 00:46:13,034
Stop!
[Arabic]

333
00:46:16,174 --> 00:46:19,871
Ibelin, that's enough!
Ibelin, no!

334
00:46:40,699 --> 00:46:44,294
You have taken it very well
that I have killed your master.

335
00:46:44,403 --> 00:46:46,871
It was the end of his time.

336
00:46:48,373 --> 00:46:50,341
All is as God wills it.

337
00:46:53,578 --> 00:46:56,138
Now finish this.

338
00:47:13,131 --> 00:47:15,759
[Sighs]
Take me to Jerusalem.

339
00:48:17,796 --> 00:48:19,593
Very good horse.

340
00:48:21,766 --> 00:48:24,200
Take the horse...

341
00:48:24,302 --> 00:48:26,668
and be about your business.

342
00:48:26,771 --> 00:48:30,172
This is your prize of battle.

343
00:48:30,275 --> 00:48:33,210
I am your prisoner...
your slave, should you wish it.

344
00:48:33,311 --> 00:48:36,405
I have been a slave,
or very near to one.

345
00:48:36,515 --> 00:48:39,109
I will never keep one,
nor suffer any to be kept.

346
00:48:39,217 --> 00:48:41,082
Go.

347
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:53,094
The man you killed was a very great
cavalier among the Muslims.

348
00:48:53,198 --> 00:48:55,359
His name was Mummad al Fais.

349
00:48:55,467 --> 00:48:57,628
I will pray for him.

350
00:48:57,736 --> 00:49:01,331
Your quality will be known
among your enemies...

351
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:04,203
before ever you meet them,
my friend.

352
00:49:14,486 --> 00:49:19,116
Old man, where is it
that Christ was crucified?

353
00:49:38,343 --> 00:49:40,402
Salaam alaikum.

354
00:50:02,434 --> 00:50:06,268
[Thinking]
God, what is it you want of me?

355
00:50:42,907 --> 00:50:46,434
[Thinking] How can you be in hell
when you're in my heart?

356
00:51:29,914 --> 00:51:33,441
- You must have known him.
- What?

357
00:51:33,551 --> 00:51:37,419
Since you carry Godfrey's sword,
you must have known him.

358
00:51:39,857 --> 00:51:41,757
I did.

359
00:51:41,859 --> 00:51:43,486
A man my size?

360
00:51:48,366 --> 00:51:50,300
Yes.

361
00:51:50,401 --> 00:51:52,528
And green eyes.

362
00:51:56,874 --> 00:51:58,842
Blue.

363
00:52:05,183 --> 00:52:07,845
Come with us...

364
00:52:07,952 --> 00:52:10,216
my lord.

365
00:52:32,643 --> 00:52:35,407
[Balian]
No. Give me the towel.

366
00:52:35,513 --> 00:52:38,004
- Give me the towel. Give me the towel.
- [Arabic]

367
00:53:10,948 --> 00:53:13,439
[Godfrey's Voice]
A man who, in France, had not a house...

368
00:53:13,551 --> 00:53:16,520
is, in the Holy Land,
the master of a city.

369
00:53:47,885 --> 00:53:50,251
- [Whinnying]
- Stop.

370
00:53:50,354 --> 00:53:52,288
You're hurting him.

371
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:56,053
Whoa. Whoa.

372
00:54:12,243 --> 00:54:15,007
Where's your master?

373
00:54:15,112 --> 00:54:16,739
I have none.

374
00:54:18,849 --> 00:54:20,817
Give me some water.

375
00:54:34,365 --> 00:54:37,334
Thank you for the drink.

376
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:42,999
If you happen to see Balian,
the son of Godfrey...

377
00:54:43,107 --> 00:54:45,007
tell him that Sibylla called.

378
00:54:56,287 --> 00:54:59,188
So, how find you Jerusalem?

379
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:01,383
God does not speak to me.

380
00:55:01,492 --> 00:55:03,858
Not even on the hill...

381
00:55:03,961 --> 00:55:05,952
where Christ died.

382
00:55:06,063 --> 00:55:08,224
I am outside God's grace.

383
00:55:08,332 --> 00:55:10,459
I have not heard that.

384
00:55:10,568 --> 00:55:13,230
At any rate, it seems...

385
00:55:14,338 --> 00:55:16,329
I have lost my religion.

386
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:19,375
I put no stock in religion.

387
00:55:19,477 --> 00:55:21,138
By the word "religion"...

388
00:55:21,245 --> 00:55:25,045
I've seen the lunacy of fanatics of every
denomination be called the will of God.

389
00:55:25,149 --> 00:55:29,813
I've seen too much religion
in the eyes of too many murderers.

390
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,717
Holiness...

391
00:55:31,822 --> 00:55:33,756
is in right action...

392
00:55:33,858 --> 00:55:38,591
and courage on behalf of those
who cannot defend themselves.

393
00:55:38,696 --> 00:55:40,687
And goodness...

394
00:55:43,634 --> 00:55:45,568
what God desires...

395
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:49,538
is here and here.

396
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:53,701
By what you decide to do every day,
you will be a good man.

397
00:55:54,812 --> 00:55:56,712
Or not.

398
00:55:56,814 --> 00:55:58,839
Come.

399
00:56:23,341 --> 00:56:26,674
The king has made a peace
with Saladin these past six years.

400
00:56:26,777 --> 00:56:30,873
He holds Jerusalem as a place
for prayer for all faiths...

401
00:56:30,981 --> 00:56:33,677
as the Muslims did before we came.

402
00:56:33,784 --> 00:56:37,083
These men are Templars.
They killed Arabs.

403
00:56:43,694 --> 00:56:46,424
So they are dying...

404
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:48,691
for what the pope
would command them to do.

405
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:52,291
Yes. But not Christ, I think.

406
00:56:52,403 --> 00:56:54,371
Nor this king.

407
00:56:59,603 --> 00:57:02,819
a

408
00:57:06,617 --> 00:57:08,847
Who says I raid?

409
00:57:08,953 --> 00:57:10,614
That witness...

410
00:57:10,721 --> 00:57:13,884
all of Jerusalem...

411
00:57:13,991 --> 00:57:16,482
holy God and me.

412
00:57:16,594 --> 00:57:21,861
That witness, if you call him that,
is a Saracen. He lies.

413
00:57:21,966 --> 00:57:24,025
There will come a day,
Reynald de Chatillon...

414
00:57:24,135 --> 00:57:27,263
when you are not protected
by your title.

415
00:57:27,371 --> 00:57:29,965
Oh? When will that be?

416
00:57:30,074 --> 00:57:32,235
Alert me, Tiberias,
when men are equal...

417
00:57:32,343 --> 00:57:34,470
and the kingdom of heaven
has arrived.

418
00:57:34,578 --> 00:57:38,480
Those Templars have been hung for
a raid that I know you commanded.

419
00:57:38,582 --> 00:57:40,777
Prove it.

420
00:57:40,885 --> 00:57:43,115
I will wait at Kerak
until you do.

421
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:47,418
The king will take
your castle of Kerak, Reynald.

422
00:57:47,525 --> 00:57:49,720
Try to take it,
Tiberias.

423
00:57:49,827 --> 00:57:51,886
I'll be there.

424
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:03,832
I cannot protect your caravans unless
you agree to be escorted by our soldiers.

425
00:58:03,941 --> 00:58:05,841
I trade to make money...

426
00:58:05,943 --> 00:58:09,174
not to offend God by
associating with Christians.

427
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:13,307
- But you will take Christian gold.
- Gold is gold.

428
00:58:14,752 --> 00:58:17,016
Mmm. Of course.

429
00:58:20,124 --> 00:58:22,024
My lord Tiberias.

430
00:58:30,701 --> 00:58:32,362
My lord.

431
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:37,399
It's true.

432
00:58:37,508 --> 00:58:39,408
You're your father's son.

433
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:41,910
He was my friend.

434
00:58:42,012 --> 00:58:44,572
I am yours.

435
00:58:44,682 --> 00:58:46,582
Godfrey dead.

436
00:58:46,684 --> 00:58:49,585
It could have come
at a better time. Come.

437
00:58:51,288 --> 00:58:55,281
It was shouted in the streets that
you killed a great lord of Syria.

438
00:58:55,392 --> 00:58:58,725
Saladin himself sent word...

439
00:58:58,829 --> 00:59:01,423
that your fight
did not breach the peace...

440
00:59:01,532 --> 00:59:03,466
that you had cause.

441
00:59:04,635 --> 00:59:07,365
What know you of Saladin?

442
00:59:07,471 --> 00:59:09,371
That he is king of the Saracens...

443
00:59:09,473 --> 00:59:11,703
and that he surrounds
this kingdom.

444
00:59:11,809 --> 00:59:15,210
He has 200,000 men
in Damascus alone.

445
00:59:15,312 --> 00:59:18,213
He could win a war
if he goes to war...

446
00:59:18,315 --> 00:59:23,309
and he's daily given cause for war
by fanatics newly from Europe...

447
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:26,082
by Templar bastards
like Reynald de Chatillon.

448
00:59:26,190 --> 00:59:30,251
Here, from this room, I keep the peace,
so far as it can be kept.

449
00:59:30,361 --> 00:59:34,457
But Saladin and the king
between them...

450
00:59:34,565 --> 00:59:37,398
would make a better world.

451
00:59:37,501 --> 00:59:41,130
If it lives only for a while,
Tiberias, it still has lived.

452
00:59:41,238 --> 00:59:43,206
All right.

453
00:59:45,843 --> 00:59:50,075
What did your father tell you
of your... obligations?

454
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:52,148
That I was to be a good knight.

455
00:59:54,051 --> 00:59:55,916
I pray the world...

456
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:58,181
and Jerusalem...

457
00:59:58,289 --> 01:00:01,952
can accommodate such a rarity...

458
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:05,028
as a perfect knight.

459
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:10,860
Have you dined?

460
01:00:18,242 --> 01:00:20,574
The Princess Sibylla of Jerusalem...

461
01:00:20,678 --> 01:00:23,238
and her husband,
Guy de Lusignan.

462
01:00:34,158 --> 01:00:37,286
[Tiberias] So, how many knights
did you find in France?

463
01:00:37,394 --> 01:00:39,692
Fifty.

464
01:00:39,797 --> 01:00:41,662
They've sworn allegiance to the king?

465
01:00:41,765 --> 01:00:44,165
Of course, Tiberias.

466
01:00:44,268 --> 01:00:46,236
Obviously.

467
01:00:50,174 --> 01:00:53,143
You sit at my table?

468
01:00:53,243 --> 01:00:58,044
- Is it not the king's table?
- Is it? I have not seen a king
at it for some years.

469
01:00:59,516 --> 01:01:03,316
I cannot eat.
I... I am finicky about company.

470
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:06,753
In France this could not inherit.

471
01:01:06,857 --> 01:01:10,418
But here there are no civilized rules.

472
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:12,427
I have business in the East.

473
01:01:14,498 --> 01:01:18,832
My wife does not
lament my absences.

474
01:01:18,936 --> 01:01:22,428
That is either the best of wives...

475
01:01:22,539 --> 01:01:25,667
or the very, very worst.

476
01:01:25,776 --> 01:01:29,439
- Do you go to meet Reynald?
- No, my lord. He is in disfavor.

477
01:01:29,546 --> 01:01:31,844
I am a member of this court.

478
01:01:31,949 --> 01:01:36,010
Why should I make league
with that... troublemaker?

479
01:01:42,793 --> 01:01:45,694
To the very best of wives.

480
01:01:45,796 --> 01:01:49,027
- [Speaking Arabic]
- God bless Jerusalem.

481
01:01:49,133 --> 01:01:51,863
[Whispers]
My lord, the king will see him now.

482
01:01:51,969 --> 01:01:54,028
The king would see Godfrey's son.

483
01:01:54,138 --> 01:01:55,730
I'll take him.

484
01:01:57,808 --> 01:02:00,709
This morning I spoke
without knowing who you were.

485
01:02:00,811 --> 01:02:04,577
I knew who you were.
It's unmistakable.

486
01:02:04,682 --> 01:02:06,809
I loved your father...

487
01:02:06,917 --> 01:02:08,885
and I shall love you.

488
01:02:12,790 --> 01:02:14,758
Do you fear being with me?

489
01:02:14,858 --> 01:02:16,826
No.

490
01:02:18,529 --> 01:02:20,895
- And yes.
- [Chuckles]

491
01:02:22,966 --> 01:02:25,491
A woman in my place
has two faces.

492
01:02:25,602 --> 01:02:28,036
One for the world...

493
01:02:28,138 --> 01:02:31,073
and one which she wears
in private.

494
01:02:31,175 --> 01:02:33,735
With you I'll be only Sibylla.

495
01:02:39,049 --> 01:02:42,041
[Whispers]
Tiberias thinks me unpredictable.

496
01:02:42,152 --> 01:02:44,882
I am unpredictable.

497
01:02:48,459 --> 01:02:50,017
No. There.

498
01:03:05,209 --> 01:03:10,306
Come forward.
I am glad to meet Godfrey's son.

499
01:03:10,414 --> 01:03:12,780
He was one of
my greatest teachers.

500
01:03:12,883 --> 01:03:17,718
He was there when, playing with
the other boys, my arm was cut.

501
01:03:17,821 --> 01:03:22,656
And it was he, not my father's physicians,
who noticed that I felt no pain.

502
01:03:23,827 --> 01:03:27,627
He wept when he gave
my father the news...

503
01:03:27,731 --> 01:03:29,699
that I am a leper.

504
01:03:32,569 --> 01:03:35,197
The Saracens say
that this disease...

505
01:03:35,305 --> 01:03:39,036
is God's vengeance against
the vanity of our kingdom.

506
01:03:39,143 --> 01:03:41,304
As wretched as I am...

507
01:03:41,411 --> 01:03:45,108
these Arabs believe that
the chastisement that awaits me in hell...

508
01:03:45,215 --> 01:03:48,742
is far more severe and lasting.

509
01:03:48,852 --> 01:03:52,117
If that's true, I call it unfair.

510
01:03:53,957 --> 01:03:55,925
Come. Sit.

511
01:03:59,129 --> 01:04:01,063
- Do you play?
- No.

512
01:04:01,165 --> 01:04:03,497
The whole world is in chess.

513
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:07,036
Any move can be the death of you.

514
01:04:07,137 --> 01:04:10,231
Do anything except
remain where you started...

515
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:13,104
and you can't be sure of your end.

516
01:04:13,210 --> 01:04:15,701
Were you sure of your end once?

517
01:04:17,648 --> 01:04:19,912
- I was.
- What was it?

518
01:04:22,052 --> 01:04:24,919
To be buried a hundred yards
from where I was born.

519
01:04:25,022 --> 01:04:27,047
And now?

520
01:04:27,157 --> 01:04:30,058
Now I sit in Jerusalem
and look upon a king.

521
01:04:34,665 --> 01:04:38,226
When I was 16
I won a great victory.

522
01:04:38,335 --> 01:04:41,429
I felt, in that moment,
I would live to be 100.

523
01:04:42,673 --> 01:04:45,972
Now I know I shall not see 30.

524
01:04:47,110 --> 01:04:50,876
None of us know our end, really...

525
01:04:50,981 --> 01:04:53,415
or what hand will guide us there.

526
01:04:53,517 --> 01:04:56,816
A king may move a man.

527
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:59,081
A father may claim a son.

528
01:04:59,189 --> 01:05:02,556
That man can also move himself.

529
01:05:02,659 --> 01:05:06,493
And only then does that man
truly begin his own game.

530
01:05:07,764 --> 01:05:09,959
Remember, how so ever
you are played...

531
01:05:10,067 --> 01:05:14,163
or by whom, your soul
is in your keeping alone...

532
01:05:14,271 --> 01:05:17,934
even though those who presume
to play you be kings or men of power.

533
01:05:18,041 --> 01:05:22,034
When you stand before God,
you cannot say...

534
01:05:22,145 --> 01:05:25,046
"But I was told by others to do thus"...

535
01:05:25,148 --> 01:05:28,982
or that virtue was not
convenient at the time.

536
01:05:29,086 --> 01:05:30,986
This will not suffice.

537
01:05:31,088 --> 01:05:33,352
Remember that.

538
01:05:35,058 --> 01:05:37,026
I will.

539
01:05:39,263 --> 01:05:41,356
You know what this is?

540
01:05:41,465 --> 01:05:44,298
- A fortification.
- What do you think of it?

541
01:05:45,569 --> 01:05:48,595
You disapprove.
Well, how would you improve it?

542
01:05:48,705 --> 01:05:54,109
A cross.
Or better, a star, like this.

543
01:05:54,211 --> 01:05:56,509
That way no part of the fortress
may be approached...

544
01:05:56,613 --> 01:05:59,309
without being exposed
to fire from another part.

545
01:05:59,416 --> 01:06:02,977
Yes, I like this. Your walls
are more difficult to address.

546
01:06:04,755 --> 01:06:06,552
Very good.

547
01:06:06,657 --> 01:06:10,889
You will go to your father's house
at Ibelin, your house now...

548
01:06:10,994 --> 01:06:15,192
and then from there
you will protect the pilgrim road.

549
01:06:15,299 --> 01:06:18,359
Safeguard in particular
the Jews and the Muslims.

550
01:06:18,468 --> 01:06:21,232
All are welcome in Jerusalem.

551
01:06:21,338 --> 01:06:26,275
Not only because it's expedient,
but because it is right.

552
01:06:26,376 --> 01:06:28,367
Protect the helpless.

553
01:06:28,478 --> 01:06:30,912
And then maybe one day,
when I am helpless...

554
01:06:31,014 --> 01:06:33,141
you will come and protect me.

555
01:07:56,233 --> 01:07:58,326
There, my lord.

556
01:07:58,435 --> 01:08:00,198
Ibelin.

557
01:08:51,988 --> 01:08:55,549
Quod sumus...

558
01:08:55,659 --> 01:08:58,321
hoc eritis.

559
01:08:58,428 --> 01:09:02,797
Such as we are, you will be.

560
01:09:35,832 --> 01:09:38,767
Your father was important.

561
01:09:38,869 --> 01:09:41,667
His lands were not.

562
01:09:41,771 --> 01:09:44,035
That will suit me.

563
01:09:48,912 --> 01:09:51,779
My lord,
you have a thousand acres...

564
01:09:51,882 --> 01:09:54,749
a hundred families.

565
01:09:54,851 --> 01:09:57,911
You have Christians,
Jews, Muslims.

566
01:09:58,021 --> 01:09:59,921
You have 50 pairs of oxen.

567
01:10:00,023 --> 01:10:03,390
This is a poor and dusty place.

568
01:10:03,493 --> 01:10:07,020
What we do not have is water.

569
01:11:14,231 --> 01:11:16,529
Right. Stone the walls.

570
01:12:15,792 --> 01:12:17,851
I'm on my way to Cana.

571
01:12:21,965 --> 01:12:24,525
Where Jesus changed water to wine.

572
01:12:26,369 --> 01:12:29,270
But a better trick would be
to change you to a nobleman.

573
01:12:29,372 --> 01:12:33,433
That should be easy. In France
a few yards of silk can make a nobleman.

574
01:12:35,545 --> 01:12:37,570
I expect your hospitality.

575
01:12:37,681 --> 01:12:39,171
It is given.

576
01:12:39,282 --> 01:12:41,409
- [Balian] Latif.
- [Arabic]

577
01:14:27,891 --> 01:14:30,860
But this isn't adultery.
It's washing.

578
01:14:35,999 --> 01:14:37,967
But if it were adultery...

579
01:14:38,067 --> 01:14:40,035
which it isn't...

580
01:14:40,136 --> 01:14:43,037
the Commandments
are not for people like us.

581
01:14:43,139 --> 01:14:45,130
They are for the others.

582
01:14:46,242 --> 01:14:48,904
Did they give you something to eat?

583
01:14:49,012 --> 01:14:51,879
They said to wait
until the master returned.

584
01:14:54,751 --> 01:14:57,720
My cook will prepare something
while you wash.

585
01:15:22,445 --> 01:15:24,345
What?

586
01:15:24,447 --> 01:15:27,245
It seems years since
I've seen a woman eat.

587
01:15:27,350 --> 01:15:28,874
Truly?

588
01:15:32,655 --> 01:15:34,953
I was watching you today.

589
01:15:35,058 --> 01:15:38,027
You've been given
a patch of dirt, and it seems...

590
01:15:39,128 --> 01:15:42,029
you will build
a new Jerusalem here.

591
01:15:42,131 --> 01:15:44,099
It is my land.

592
01:15:46,236 --> 01:15:49,205
Who would I be if I did not try
to make it better?

593
01:16:04,754 --> 01:16:07,780
They try to be one...

594
01:16:07,891 --> 01:16:10,121
one heart...

595
01:16:10,226 --> 01:16:12,194
one morality.

596
01:16:12,295 --> 01:16:14,889
Their prophet says, "Submit."

597
01:16:14,998 --> 01:16:17,125
Jesus says...

598
01:16:18,167 --> 01:16:20,499
"Decide."

599
01:16:20,603 --> 01:16:23,401
Did you decide on Guy?

600
01:16:26,309 --> 01:16:28,573
Guy was chosen by my mother.

601
01:16:28,678 --> 01:16:31,476
My first husband died
before our son was born.

602
01:16:31,581 --> 01:16:34,948
I was only 15.

603
01:16:36,553 --> 01:16:38,919
I've met your son.

604
01:18:20,456 --> 01:18:22,515
I could stay here forever.

605
01:18:22,625 --> 01:18:25,287
This house is yours.

606
01:18:25,395 --> 01:18:28,091
Why do you think I'm here?

607
01:18:39,242 --> 01:18:42,143
I know that Ibelin
is not on the way to Cana.

608
01:18:42,245 --> 01:18:44,440
What else do you know,
my lord?

609
01:18:44,547 --> 01:18:46,913
I know that you are a princess...

610
01:18:47,984 --> 01:18:49,781
and I am no lord.

611
01:18:49,886 --> 01:18:51,547
You're a knight.

612
01:18:51,654 --> 01:18:54,714
Neither earned nor proved.

613
01:18:59,696 --> 01:19:04,827
I'm not here with you because
I'm... I'm bored or wicked.

614
01:19:05,968 --> 01:19:07,936
I'm here because...

615
01:19:09,005 --> 01:19:10,905
because in the East...

616
01:19:11,007 --> 01:19:13,908
between one person
and another...

617
01:19:14,010 --> 01:19:16,137
there is only light.

618
01:20:29,051 --> 01:20:31,383
Halt!

619
01:20:34,423 --> 01:20:36,755
This caravan is armed, Reynald.

620
01:20:36,859 --> 01:20:38,656
Good. No sport otherwise.

621
01:20:40,429 --> 01:20:42,522
[Guy]
They've seen us.

622
01:20:42,632 --> 01:20:44,395
Go after them.

623
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:47,333
- A rider is getting away.
- It's a broad desert. Nothing'll come of it.

624
01:20:47,436 --> 01:20:51,736
- I prefer not to be hanged
before my wife is queen.
- [Reynald] Don't worry.

625
01:20:51,841 --> 01:20:53,866
"Who but Reynald?" they'll say.

626
01:20:53,976 --> 01:20:57,002
It's always me. They'll believe it
in Jerusalem, I assure you.

627
01:20:57,113 --> 01:21:01,379
- You were at Nazareth, praying.
- You're a dangerous man.

628
01:21:01,484 --> 01:21:04,783
If the war's to be now or later,
I would have it now.

629
01:21:04,887 --> 01:21:08,584
- How long can the leper last?
- God wills it. God wills it!

630
01:21:08,691 --> 01:21:11,717
- [All Shouting] God wills it!
- Jerusalem!

631
01:21:11,828 --> 01:21:14,763
Charge!

632
01:21:41,224 --> 01:21:44,125
It's you! Ha!

633
01:22:21,530 --> 01:22:23,964
This is from France.

634
01:22:24,066 --> 01:22:25,693
I've never been there.

635
01:22:25,801 --> 01:22:27,962
This from my brother.

636
01:22:28,070 --> 01:22:30,538
This to remind us of death.

637
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:33,302
And this...

638
01:22:34,944 --> 01:22:37,310
I put the day I saw you.

639
01:22:39,081 --> 01:22:41,106
You lie.

640
01:23:09,645 --> 01:23:14,241
[Tiberias] Guy de Lusignan and
Reynald de Chatillon, with the Templars...

641
01:23:14,350 --> 01:23:16,318
have attacked a Saracen caravan.

642
01:23:16,419 --> 01:23:19,354
- [Angry Shouting]
- Liar!

643
01:23:19,455 --> 01:23:21,355
[Guy]
Silence!

644
01:23:21,457 --> 01:23:23,584
It was no caravan.

645
01:23:23,693 --> 01:23:27,220
It was an army headed for Bethlehem
to desecrate the birthplace of our Lord!

646
01:23:27,330 --> 01:23:31,494
Reynald, with the Templars,
have broken the king's pledge of peace.

647
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,068
Saladin will come into this kingdom...

648
01:23:34,170 --> 01:23:38,607
Tiberias knows more than a Christian
should about Saladin' s intentions.

649
01:23:43,646 --> 01:23:47,776
That I would rather live
with men than kill them...

650
01:23:47,883 --> 01:23:50,716
is certainly why you are alive.

651
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:54,119
That sort of Christianity
has its uses, I suppose.

652
01:23:54,223 --> 01:23:57,886
- [Scattered Laughing]
- We must not go to war with Saladin!

653
01:23:57,994 --> 01:24:01,725
- We do not want it, and we may not win it.
- Blasphemy!

654
01:24:01,831 --> 01:24:03,799
[All Shouting]
Blasphemy!

655
01:24:06,168 --> 01:24:09,604
An army of Jesus Christ, which bears
his holy cross, cannot be beaten.

656
01:24:09,705 --> 01:24:13,106
[Templar Master]
Does the count of Tiberias
suggest that it could be?

657
01:24:13,209 --> 01:24:16,201
There must be war.
God wills it!

658
01:24:16,312 --> 01:24:19,645
- God wills it!
- God wills it!

659
01:24:19,749 --> 01:24:22,445
- [All Shouting]
- God wills it!

660
01:24:22,551 --> 01:24:24,246
God wills it!

661
01:24:32,561 --> 01:24:34,791
Silence!

662
01:24:43,973 --> 01:24:47,841
Saladin has crossed the Jordan
with 200,000 men.

663
01:24:49,345 --> 01:24:52,508
He will make first for Kerak
and Reynald de Chatillon.

664
01:24:52,615 --> 01:24:54,515
My lord...

665
01:25:01,757 --> 01:25:05,193
We must meet him
before he reaches Kerak.

666
01:25:05,294 --> 01:25:07,262
I will lead the army.

667
01:25:07,363 --> 01:25:11,823
My lord, if you travel,
you'll die.

668
01:25:11,934 --> 01:25:15,199
Send word to Balian
to protect the villagers.

669
01:25:17,973 --> 01:25:19,873
Assemble the army.

670
01:25:40,162 --> 01:25:42,130
What becomes of us?

671
01:25:43,599 --> 01:25:45,567
The world will decide.

672
01:25:47,303 --> 01:25:50,500
The world always decides.

673
01:26:08,858 --> 01:26:11,986
My lord!
The king is marching on Kerak.

674
01:26:26,909 --> 01:26:30,242
Let's go!
Hurry. Straight on!

675
01:26:36,018 --> 01:26:40,079
Saracen cavalry.
They're coming to close Reynald in.

676
01:26:40,189 --> 01:26:42,783
These people are not safe
outside the walls.

677
01:26:42,892 --> 01:26:45,520
Saladin will certainly
come behind him.

678
01:26:58,641 --> 01:27:01,109
Go into the fortress now.

679
01:27:02,311 --> 01:27:06,407
- [Speaks Arabic]
- Hyah! Hah!

680
01:27:13,889 --> 01:27:16,119
- Hyah! Hyah!
- Hyah!

681
01:27:16,225 --> 01:27:18,284
- Hyah!
- Hyah!

682
01:27:32,875 --> 01:27:35,070
Visitors!

683
01:27:45,788 --> 01:27:49,622
My lord Balian!
My lord Balian!

684
01:27:51,293 --> 01:27:54,456
My lord Reynald prays
you bring your force into Kerak.

685
01:27:54,563 --> 01:27:58,090
Thank you, but no.
If we do, these people will die.

686
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:02,000
We'll hold the Saracen cavalry
until the king arrives.

687
01:28:02,104 --> 01:28:05,471
So be it. Hyah!

688
01:28:07,776 --> 01:28:10,142
We cannot attack that and live.

689
01:28:13,415 --> 01:28:17,112
- My lady.
- [Coughing] What do you look at?

690
01:28:17,219 --> 01:28:19,187
A knight.

691
01:28:21,323 --> 01:28:23,223
His men.

692
01:28:30,499 --> 01:28:33,798
Are you with me?

693
01:29:30,359 --> 01:29:32,589
Forward!

694
01:29:40,135 --> 01:29:43,036
Divide!

695
01:31:46,644 --> 01:31:49,613
Your quality will be known
among your enemies...

696
01:31:49,714 --> 01:31:51,978
before ever you meet them,
my friend.

697
01:31:55,186 --> 01:31:57,950
You were not that man's servant.

698
01:31:58,055 --> 01:32:01,354
No. He was my servant.

699
01:32:11,168 --> 01:32:14,729
- What becomes of us?
- As you deserve.

700
01:32:14,839 --> 01:32:18,297
You reap what you sow.

701
01:32:18,409 --> 01:32:21,276
You have heard of this, no?

702
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:24,775
Get up.

703
01:32:37,628 --> 01:32:39,596
You may go into Kerak...

704
01:32:39,697 --> 01:32:42,257
but you will die there.

705
01:32:42,366 --> 01:32:44,994
My master is here.

706
01:33:04,989 --> 01:33:08,618
Tell my lord Saladin
that Jerusalem has come.

707
01:34:09,787 --> 01:34:11,687
[Whispers]
Saladin.

708
01:34:34,211 --> 01:34:38,739
I pray you'll pull back your cavalry
and leave this matter to me.

709
01:34:38,849 --> 01:34:43,650
I pray you'll retire
unharmed to Damascus.

710
01:34:43,754 --> 01:34:46,382
Reynald of Chatillon
will be punished.

711
01:34:46,490 --> 01:34:48,390
I swear it.

712
01:34:48,492 --> 01:34:51,461
Withdraw, or we will all die here.

713
01:35:03,607 --> 01:35:05,837
Do we have terms?

714
01:35:09,980 --> 01:35:11,948
We have terms.

715
01:35:19,390 --> 01:35:22,848
I will send you my physicians.

716
01:35:24,428 --> 01:35:28,455
- Salaam alaikum.
- Alaikum salaam.

717
01:35:48,119 --> 01:35:51,213
I am Reynald of Chatillon!

718
01:36:31,629 --> 01:36:33,995
On your knees.

719
01:36:36,267 --> 01:36:38,462
Lower.

720
01:36:41,038 --> 01:36:44,599
I... am Jerusalem.

721
01:36:46,811 --> 01:36:49,905
And you, Reynald...

722
01:36:50,014 --> 01:36:53,211
will give me the kiss of peace.

723
01:37:11,969 --> 01:37:13,960
Guard.

724
01:37:21,645 --> 01:37:24,876
- What are you looking at?
- A dead man.

725
01:37:24,982 --> 01:37:27,974
Reynald de Chatillon,
you are arrested...

726
01:37:28,085 --> 01:37:30,110
and condemned.

727
01:37:32,990 --> 01:37:35,720
Come.

728
01:37:46,837 --> 01:37:50,068
If you continue like this...

729
01:37:50,174 --> 01:37:52,506
I shall have to find a use for you.

730
01:37:52,610 --> 01:37:54,578
If God can spare you, that is.

731
01:37:54,678 --> 01:37:56,805
God does not know me.

732
01:37:56,914 --> 01:37:58,575
Yes, but I do.

733
01:38:22,039 --> 01:38:24,667
I need you in Jerusalem.

734
01:41:52,071 --> 01:41:54,972
- Salaam alaikum.
- Alaikum salaam.

735
01:42:02,115 --> 01:42:05,278
Why did we retire?

736
01:42:05,385 --> 01:42:08,377
Why?

737
01:42:08,488 --> 01:42:12,481
God did not favor him. God, alone,
determines the results of battles.

738
01:42:12,592 --> 01:42:15,925
The results of battles
are determined by God...

739
01:42:16,029 --> 01:42:19,328
but also by preparation, numbers...

740
01:42:19,432 --> 01:42:23,198
the absence of disease
and the availability of water.

741
01:42:23,303 --> 01:42:27,501
One cannot maintain a siege
with the enemy behind.

742
01:42:27,607 --> 01:42:32,169
How many battles did God win
for the Muslims before I came?

743
01:42:32,278 --> 01:42:36,681
That is, before God determined
that I should come.

744
01:42:38,318 --> 01:42:40,218
Few enough.

745
01:42:41,721 --> 01:42:44,189
That's because we were sinful.

746
01:42:45,992 --> 01:42:48,825
It is because
you were unprepared.

747
01:42:48,928 --> 01:42:52,159
If you think that way,
you shall not be king for long.

748
01:42:58,604 --> 01:43:02,370
When I am not king,
I quake for Islam.

749
01:43:03,810 --> 01:43:05,801
Thank you for your visit.

750
01:43:09,882 --> 01:43:12,544
Thank you for your visit.

751
01:43:17,724 --> 01:43:19,954
You promised.

752
01:43:20,059 --> 01:43:23,153
You promised to return Jerusalem.

753
01:43:24,664 --> 01:43:26,564
Don't forget.

754
01:43:42,248 --> 01:43:45,684
If I do not deliver war,
I have no peace.

755
01:43:45,785 --> 01:43:48,686
The king of Jerusalem
will die soon.

756
01:43:48,788 --> 01:43:53,225
When he is dead, the boy will become
king of a kingdom he cannot control.

757
01:43:53,326 --> 01:43:58,093
The Christians will
make the war you need.

758
01:44:56,589 --> 01:45:00,116
I am Reynald de Chatillon!
[Echoes]

759

I am Reynald de Chatillon!

01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:11,463
Reynald de Chatillon!

Reynald de Chatillon!
[Echoes]

762
01:45:19,312 --> 01:45:23,646
The things that
we have left undone...

763
01:45:23,749 --> 01:45:27,446
plague us as death comes.

764
01:45:27,553 --> 01:45:29,885
- That is why to the dying...
- [Labored Breathing]

765
01:45:29,989 --> 01:45:32,583
There is no comfort but the Lord.

766
01:45:32,692 --> 01:45:35,684
Spare me your sermon.

767
01:45:35,795 --> 01:45:39,595
Go and prepare your people
for the coronation of my nephew.

768
01:45:42,001 --> 01:45:44,629
Your confession, my lord.

769
01:45:44,737 --> 01:45:47,831
I shall confess to God
when I see him...

770
01:45:50,776 --> 01:45:52,744
not to you.

771
01:45:53,779 --> 01:45:56,339
Now leave me.

772
01:46:42,094 --> 01:46:45,928
You sometimes dream
you are my wife.

773
01:46:46,032 --> 01:46:48,728
Let's pretend you are.

774
01:47:26,339 --> 01:47:28,307
I must go.

775
01:47:32,712 --> 01:47:36,148
We can't meet in the city.

776
01:47:36,249 --> 01:47:38,012
Then we will leave it.

777
01:47:38,117 --> 01:47:42,110
And live how?
Live where?

778
01:47:42,221 --> 01:47:44,280
Balian...

779
01:47:44,390 --> 01:47:47,655
my brother's dying.

780
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:53,164
My son will be king and I his regent.
I must rule for him.

781
01:47:53,266 --> 01:47:56,997
And not just in Jerusalem,
but Acre...

782
01:47:57,103 --> 01:47:59,469
Ashkelon, Beirut.

783
01:48:02,108 --> 01:48:04,076
And Guy?

784
01:48:32,305 --> 01:48:36,105
Always surround your knights
with your foot soldiers.

785
01:48:39,245 --> 01:48:41,304
These rooms are not yours.

786
01:48:44,550 --> 01:48:48,714
One day I will be the husband
I was commissioned to be.

787
01:48:48,821 --> 01:48:51,881
And perhaps not, my dear.

788
01:48:51,991 --> 01:48:56,325
Your lover has a hundred knights
and the love of the king.

789
01:48:56,429 --> 01:48:59,887
I, the largest force
in the kingdom...

790
01:48:59,999 --> 01:49:02,661
and the support of the Templars.

791
01:49:02,768 --> 01:49:06,397
I can do without
the king's affection.

792
01:49:06,505 --> 01:49:08,530
But as for your love...

793
01:49:18,084 --> 01:49:20,416
Then we must come
to an understanding.

794
01:49:20,519 --> 01:49:26,082
You need my knights or his rule
will be bloody and brief.

795
01:49:40,272 --> 01:49:42,365
So, my friend...

796
01:49:42,475 --> 01:49:46,070
the time has come
to conclude my affairs.

797
01:49:46,178 --> 01:49:48,146
If I leave the army with Guy...

798
01:49:48,247 --> 01:49:52,115
he will take power through my sister
and make war on the Muslims.

799
01:49:52,218 --> 01:49:56,917
We have decided that you shall take
command of the army of Jerusalem.

800
01:49:57,022 --> 01:50:00,924
Will you defend my nephew
when he's king?

801
01:50:02,328 --> 01:50:05,491
Whatever you ask.
I will serve.

802
01:50:05,598 --> 01:50:09,694
No, hear it all
before you answer.

803
01:50:09,802 --> 01:50:14,899
Would you marry my sister, Sibylla,
were she free of Guy de Lusignan?

804
01:50:16,542 --> 01:50:18,442
And Guy?

805
01:50:18,544 --> 01:50:21,707
He will be executed...

806
01:50:21,814 --> 01:50:25,910
along with his knights who
do not swear your allegiance.

807
01:50:28,988 --> 01:50:31,183
I cannot be the cause of that.

808
01:50:31,290 --> 01:50:36,023
"Whatever you ask.
I will serve."

809
01:50:38,931 --> 01:50:42,492
"A king may move a man,"
you said...

810
01:50:44,103 --> 01:50:47,698
"but the soul belongs
to the man."

811
01:50:47,807 --> 01:50:50,469
Yes, I did.

812
01:50:50,576 --> 01:50:52,771
You have my love...

813
01:50:52,878 --> 01:50:55,676
and my answer.

814
01:50:55,781 --> 01:50:58,807
Oh. So be it.

815
01:50:59,885 --> 01:51:02,979
Why do you protect Guy, hmm?

816
01:51:03,088 --> 01:51:06,285
He's a man who insults you,
who hates you...

817
01:51:06,392 --> 01:51:09,020
who'd kill you himself
if he had the chance.

818
01:51:09,128 --> 01:51:11,858
Fulfill the salvation of this kingdom.

819
01:51:11,964 --> 01:51:13,898
Would it be so hard...

820
01:51:13,999 --> 01:51:16,866
to marry Sibylla?

821
01:51:16,969 --> 01:51:21,702
Jerusalem has no need
of a perfect knight.

822
01:51:21,807 --> 01:51:25,709
No. It is a kingdom
of conscience...

823
01:51:25,811 --> 01:51:27,711
or nothing.

824
01:51:46,866 --> 01:51:48,766
Sibylla.

825
01:52:01,347 --> 01:52:04,111
Who are you to refuse a king?

826
01:52:04,216 --> 01:52:07,947
I will have power,
without Guy or with him.

827
01:52:08,053 --> 01:52:12,353
Guy is indebted to your say-so
and my brother's, but it's mine.

828
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:18,189
Do you have any idea of Jerusalem
except that it is yours?

829
01:52:18,297 --> 01:52:21,562
You will never hold it in peace
as your brother did.

830
01:52:21,667 --> 01:52:23,464
It will be war.

831
01:52:23,569 --> 01:52:27,061
My grandfather took
Jerusalem in blood.

832
01:52:27,172 --> 01:52:31,074
I'll keep it the same way
or any way I can.

833
01:52:31,176 --> 01:52:33,041
I am what I am.

834
01:52:33,145 --> 01:52:35,238
I offer you that...

835
01:52:36,315 --> 01:52:38,408
and the world.

836
01:52:44,723 --> 01:52:46,987
You say no.

837
01:52:48,761 --> 01:52:51,229
Do you think I'm like Guy?

838
01:52:51,330 --> 01:52:54,822
That I would sell my soul?

839
01:53:01,106 --> 01:53:03,074
There'll be a day...

840
01:53:03,175 --> 01:53:06,144
when you will wish you
had done a little evil...

841
01:53:06,245 --> 01:53:08,873
to do a greater good.

842
01:53:15,054 --> 01:53:18,023
- [Man] Reynald.
- [Door Unlocking]

843
01:53:25,130 --> 01:53:27,098
My lord.

844
01:54:03,402 --> 01:54:05,302
Mmm.

845
01:54:07,306 --> 01:54:12,767
Do you really think the king wants you
head of the army once he's gone? Hmm?

846
01:54:13,846 --> 01:54:16,508
Think your wife does?

847
01:54:22,521 --> 01:54:26,651
- I have a problem.
- Ah, yes. Balian.

848
01:54:26,759 --> 01:54:29,227
I saw him at Kerak.

849
01:54:30,629 --> 01:54:33,325
Celebrated.

850
01:54:33,432 --> 01:54:37,163
You must beware a popular man.

851
01:54:37,269 --> 01:54:39,863
Kill him.

852
01:54:46,378 --> 01:54:48,505
- [Sibylla] What's that?
- [Boy] England.

853
01:54:48,614 --> 01:54:51,742
- The king?
- Richard. And his father was Henry.

854
01:54:51,850 --> 01:54:54,910
- Good. And that?
- France.

855
01:54:55,020 --> 01:54:56,783
Will I ever see France?

856
01:54:56,889 --> 01:55:00,120
Maybe one day.
But you must be king here.

857
01:55:01,293 --> 01:55:04,694
How many islands can you see here?

858
01:55:04,797 --> 01:55:07,891
- One, two...
- The king will see you.

859
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:13,700
No, I can't. I can't bear
to look at him. Use this.

860
01:55:13,806 --> 01:55:16,570
It doesn't mean
I don't love him.

861
01:55:16,675 --> 01:55:19,269
Go, madam.

862
01:56:56,074 --> 01:56:59,305
Oh. Hello.

863
01:57:03,382 --> 01:57:05,350
I was dreaming...

864
01:57:05,450 --> 01:57:09,147
I was back in that summer...

865
01:57:09,254 --> 01:57:11,484
when I defeated Saladin.

866
01:57:11,590 --> 01:57:14,559
Do you remember it?

867
01:57:14,660 --> 01:57:17,720
I was only 16.

868
01:57:17,830 --> 01:57:20,321
You were a beautiful boy.

869
01:57:20,432 --> 01:57:23,663
- Yes.
- You have always been beautiful.

870
01:57:24,770 --> 01:57:26,738
In every way.

871
01:57:30,442 --> 01:57:35,345
My beautiful sister.
I've missed you.

872
01:57:35,447 --> 01:57:37,347
So beautiful.

873
01:57:39,151 --> 01:57:42,177
I'm sorry if I've caused you any pain.

874
01:57:45,390 --> 01:57:48,359
Remember me as I was.

875
01:57:50,262 --> 01:57:52,162
I will.

876
01:58:43,282 --> 01:58:45,341
Sibylla.

877
01:58:59,564 --> 01:59:01,998
If my son has your knights...

878
01:59:04,803 --> 01:59:07,670
you have your wife.

879
02:00:30,322 --> 02:00:32,813
[Patriarch]
Behold your rightful king and heir...

880
02:00:32,924 --> 02:00:35,916
to the throne
of the kingdom of Jerusalem.

881
02:00:36,028 --> 02:00:39,623
[Chanting]
Yes! Yes! Yes!

882
02:00:39,731 --> 02:00:42,529
[Patriarch]
Long live the king in prosperity.

883
02:00:42,634 --> 02:00:46,695
[With Crowd]
Long live the king. Long live the king.

884
02:00:46,805 --> 02:00:48,739
Long live the king.

885
02:01:03,522 --> 02:01:07,049
One may stare into the light
until one becomes the light.

886
02:01:07,159 --> 02:01:09,320
I've done it many times.

887
02:01:16,368 --> 02:01:18,302
There's your religion.

888
02:01:18,403 --> 02:01:21,668
One spark,
a creosote bush.

889
02:01:24,376 --> 02:01:28,972
There's your Moses.
I did not hear it speak.

890
02:01:29,081 --> 02:01:31,845
That does not mean
that there is no God.

891
02:01:31,950 --> 02:01:35,147
Do you love her?

892
02:01:35,253 --> 02:01:38,518
- Yes.
- The heart will mend.

893
02:01:38,623 --> 02:01:41,922
Your duty is to the people
of the city.

894
02:01:42,027 --> 02:01:44,427
- I go to pray.
- For what?

895
02:01:47,599 --> 02:01:50,591
For the strength to endure
what is to come.

896
02:01:50,702 --> 02:01:52,602
And what is to come?

897
02:01:52,704 --> 02:01:57,334
The reckoning is to come
for what was done 100 years before.

898
02:01:57,442 --> 02:02:00,377
The Muslims will never forget.

899
02:02:03,982 --> 02:02:05,973
Nor should they.

900
02:02:37,182 --> 02:02:40,151
My lady,
your letter to Saladin.

901
02:02:40,252 --> 02:02:45,121
Peace to be sustained, borders
respected, trade allowed to continue.

902
02:02:45,223 --> 02:02:48,886
Is this wise
to show your intentions?

903
02:02:48,994 --> 02:02:51,929
Better, surely,
to let him wonder.

904
02:02:52,030 --> 02:02:54,055
We keep my brother's peace.

905
02:02:54,166 --> 02:02:56,259
[Whispers]
Sign it.

906
02:03:07,345 --> 02:03:09,836
Take the seal.

907
02:03:11,116 --> 02:03:14,176
[Clicks Tongue]
Be careful. Be careful.

908
02:03:25,664 --> 02:03:28,633
Put it back, my darling.

909
02:03:41,646 --> 02:03:44,706
Hey!
[Laughing]

910
02:04:14,446 --> 02:04:17,040
There is a rumor.

911
02:04:17,148 --> 02:04:19,139
We must condemn it immediately.

912
02:04:20,452 --> 02:04:24,650
Call it treason,
and kill those who whisper it.

913
02:04:24,756 --> 02:04:29,090
The rumor will die
if we show the boy as active.

914
02:04:31,029 --> 02:04:34,430
How long before he wears a mask?

915
02:04:37,002 --> 02:04:39,971
Will you have one made for him?

916
02:04:40,071 --> 02:04:44,701
How did my boy deserve it?

917
02:04:48,747 --> 02:04:51,181
Jerusalem is dead, Tiberias.

918
02:04:53,885 --> 02:04:57,184
No kingdom is worth
my son alive in hell.

919
02:04:59,157 --> 02:05:02,558
I will go to hell instead.

920
02:05:24,949 --> 02:05:28,407
- Do you remember the story of Llewellyn?
- No.

921
02:05:28,520 --> 02:05:32,684
- Well, do you remember why?
- No.

922
02:05:32,791 --> 02:05:35,055
He was so lonely...

923
02:05:35,160 --> 02:05:38,891
and he called all the gods.

924
02:05:38,997 --> 02:05:43,434
- Why?
- Because he was desperate.
It was a proof of love.

925
02:07:27,071 --> 02:07:29,699
Is this why you came
to the Holy Land?

926
02:07:29,808 --> 02:07:32,038
Come on!

927
02:07:55,433 --> 02:07:57,333
Leave us.

928
02:08:02,073 --> 02:08:05,531
- The boy's in heaven?
- Yes.

929
02:08:05,643 --> 02:08:09,477
His mother has more
backbone than I do.

930
02:08:09,581 --> 02:08:12,846
She's in the crypt
and will not come out.

931
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:20,653
- Have the Templars killed Balian?
- Yes.

932
02:08:20,758 --> 02:08:23,283
Reynald...

933
02:08:23,394 --> 02:08:25,362
give me a war.

934
02:08:26,965 --> 02:08:29,593
That is what I do.

935
02:08:31,336 --> 02:08:33,827
[Patriarch]
Behold your rightful queen and heir...

936
02:08:33,938 --> 02:08:36,168
to the throne
of the kingdom of Jerusalem.

937
02:08:36,274 --> 02:08:38,902
[Chanting]
Yes! Yes! Yes!

938
02:08:39,010 --> 02:08:42,070
I, Sibylla, by the grace
of the Holy Spirit...

939
02:08:42,180 --> 02:08:45,775
choose as king
Guy de Lusignan...

940
02:08:45,884 --> 02:08:48,785
the man who's been
my husband.

941
02:08:48,887 --> 02:08:52,050
With the help of God,
he will rule his people well.

942
02:08:55,493 --> 02:08:58,860
[Patriarch]
Long live the king in prosperity.

943
02:08:58,963 --> 02:09:02,990
[With Crowd]
Long live the king. Long live the king.

944
02:09:03,101 --> 02:09:04,966
Long live the king.

945
02:09:27,592 --> 02:09:30,720
I am what I am.

946
02:09:30,828 --> 02:09:32,728
Someone has to be.

947
02:09:57,522 --> 02:09:59,490
Saladin' s sister.

948
02:10:00,959 --> 02:10:02,859
I know.

949
02:10:18,943 --> 02:10:20,934
Saladin achki.

950
02:10:22,680 --> 02:10:24,671
I know.

951
02:10:47,372 --> 02:10:51,001
- Salaam alaikum.
- Alaikum salaam.

952
02:10:51,109 --> 02:10:53,009
Speak.

953
02:10:58,316 --> 02:11:01,410
The sultan demands the return
of his sister's body...

954
02:11:01,519 --> 02:11:03,510
the heads of those responsible...

955
02:11:03,621 --> 02:11:05,919
and the surrender of Jerusalem.

956
02:11:10,294 --> 02:11:12,194
Does he?

957
02:11:13,798 --> 02:11:16,266
What answer do you return to Saladin?

958
02:11:27,645 --> 02:11:30,409
- This.
- [Grunts]

959
02:11:44,829 --> 02:11:48,060
- [Shouting In Arabic]
- Take the head to Damascus.

960
02:11:56,007 --> 02:11:58,237
I am Jerusalem.

961
02:12:02,513 --> 02:12:07,610
- Assemble the army! Yea!
- [All Cheering]

962
02:12:28,372 --> 02:12:30,636
Now this assembly of barons...

963
02:12:30,742 --> 02:12:34,007
and all Jerusalem
is complete.

964
02:12:34,112 --> 02:12:38,674
There are those among you who
may disagree with our succession...

965
02:12:38,783 --> 02:12:41,547
but it is war.

966
02:12:41,652 --> 02:12:43,882
[Soldiers]
Aye!

967
02:12:43,988 --> 02:12:46,752
And I am...

968
02:12:46,858 --> 02:12:48,951
the king.

969
02:12:50,094 --> 02:12:53,427
We march at once.
What say this council?

970
02:12:53,531 --> 02:12:57,160
- [All] Aye!
- No.

971
02:12:57,268 --> 02:13:02,365
If you must have war, this army
cannot move away from water.

972
02:13:03,775 --> 02:13:07,040
You have a chance
to hold the city...

973
02:13:07,145 --> 02:13:09,909
but if you move out
against Saladin...

974
02:13:10,014 --> 02:13:13,472
this army will be destroyed
and the city left defenseless.

975
02:13:13,584 --> 02:13:17,281
When I wish a blacksmith
to advise me in war...

976
02:13:17,388 --> 02:13:19,856
I will tell him.

977
02:13:19,957 --> 02:13:22,653
Saladin wants you to come out.

978
02:13:24,529 --> 02:13:28,021
He is waiting for you
to make that mistake.

979
02:13:28,132 --> 02:13:30,327
He knows his man.

980
02:13:30,434 --> 02:13:33,267
- We should meet the enemies of God.
- Aye!

981
02:13:33,371 --> 02:13:35,271
And so we shall.

982
02:13:35,373 --> 02:13:38,831
Then you do so
without my knights.

983
02:13:38,943 --> 02:13:44,381
Then I will have the glory, Tiberias.
You had yours years and years ago.

984
02:13:44,482 --> 02:13:47,144
It's time for mine.

985
02:13:52,623 --> 02:13:55,421
[Officer]
Forward!

986
02:13:57,795 --> 02:13:59,763
Forward!

987
02:14:15,146 --> 02:14:17,114
Tiberias.

988
02:14:18,549 --> 02:14:23,179
When Saladin has finished
with Guy, he will come.

989
02:14:23,287 --> 02:14:25,255
We must look to the defenses.

990
02:14:25,356 --> 02:14:28,723
The boy's dead.

991
02:14:32,630 --> 02:14:34,621
- Guy.
- No.

992
02:14:34,732 --> 02:14:37,530
The boy was leprous
like his uncle.

993
02:14:37,635 --> 02:14:40,297
She gave him peace.

994
02:14:40,404 --> 02:14:42,372
She let him go...

995
02:14:44,709 --> 02:14:48,543
and Jerusalem along with him.

996
02:14:52,350 --> 02:14:54,716
[Officer]
Keep to your lines!

997
02:14:54,819 --> 02:14:56,980
You go with the army?

998
02:14:57,088 --> 02:14:59,056
My order is with the army.

999
02:14:59,156 --> 02:15:01,920
You go to certain death.

1000
02:15:02,026 --> 02:15:04,256
All death is certain.

1001
02:15:04,362 --> 02:15:07,991
I shall tell your father
what I've seen you become.

1002
02:15:49,607 --> 02:15:51,871
When Saladin comes...

1003
02:15:52,977 --> 02:15:55,946
we're not defensible.

1004
02:15:58,416 --> 02:16:01,544
Save the people
from what I have done.

1005
02:16:01,652 --> 02:16:03,552
I will.

1006
02:17:06,450 --> 02:17:07,974
God wills it.

1007
02:17:37,515 --> 02:17:40,109
Can you sense it?

1008
02:17:40,217 --> 02:17:43,084
There has been no messenger.

1009
02:19:04,168 --> 02:19:07,001
I drink water for what it is.

1010
02:19:11,008 --> 02:19:13,033
I did not give the cup to you.

1011
02:19:13,144 --> 02:19:15,908
No, my lord.

1012
02:20:25,749 --> 02:20:28,718
A king does not kill a king.

1013
02:20:28,819 --> 02:20:31,287
Were you not close enough
to a great king...

1014
02:20:31,388 --> 02:20:33,982
to learn by his example?

1015
02:21:11,362 --> 02:21:14,490
I've given Jerusalem my whole life.

1016
02:21:14,598 --> 02:21:16,498
Everything.

1017
02:21:19,036 --> 02:21:24,133
First I thought we...
were fighting for God.

1018
02:21:24,241 --> 02:21:29,042
Then I realized we were fighting
for wealth and land.

1019
02:21:29,146 --> 02:21:31,114
I was ashamed.

1020
02:21:39,356 --> 02:21:41,551
Tiberias.

1021
02:21:41,659 --> 02:21:44,492
There is no more Jerusalem.

1022
02:21:45,796 --> 02:21:49,698
I shall go to Cyprus.
Will you come with me?

1023
02:21:49,800 --> 02:21:51,358
No.

1024
02:21:52,836 --> 02:21:55,304
You are your father's son.

1025
02:21:56,940 --> 02:22:01,502
Saladin must move his army
from water to water.

1026
02:22:01,612 --> 02:22:05,548
That gives you four days,
maybe five.

1027
02:22:06,984 --> 02:22:09,509
God be with you.

1028
02:22:09,620 --> 02:22:13,215
He's no longer with me.

1029
02:23:05,409 --> 02:23:08,572
- Mark 400.
- Four hundred!

1030
02:23:08,679 --> 02:23:11,773
Four hundred!

1031
02:23:26,363 --> 02:23:28,263
They're here.

1032
02:23:28,365 --> 02:23:30,060
It is only one man.

1033
02:23:33,737 --> 02:23:36,433
No. They're here.

1034
02:23:56,293 --> 02:23:59,956
This is the only section of the wall
that they can attack...

1035
02:24:00,063 --> 02:24:02,930
once they begin
to bombard the walls.

1036
02:24:03,033 --> 02:24:06,264
They will stop only to avoid hitting
their own siege towers as they come in.

1037
02:24:06,370 --> 02:24:08,702
We take the bombardment.

1038
02:24:08,806 --> 02:24:11,366
When they cease firing, we fire.

1039
02:24:15,112 --> 02:24:17,910
We must leave the city.

1040
02:24:18,015 --> 02:24:19,983
How exactly, my lord bishop?

1041
02:24:20,083 --> 02:24:22,574
The fastest horses
from a lesser gate.

1042
02:24:23,620 --> 02:24:25,520
And the people?

1043
02:24:25,622 --> 02:24:29,854
It is unfortunate about the people,
but it is God's will.

1044
02:24:37,267 --> 02:24:39,201
[Man]
Silence!

1045
02:24:42,473 --> 02:24:44,373
Silence!

1046
02:24:48,545 --> 02:24:50,513
It has fallen to us...

1047
02:24:50,614 --> 02:24:52,673
to defend Jerusalem...

1048
02:24:52,783 --> 02:24:57,015
and we have made our preparations
as well as they can be made.

1049
02:24:58,655 --> 02:25:02,056
None of us took this city
from Muslims.

1050
02:25:03,527 --> 02:25:07,395
No Muslim, of the great army
now coming against us...

1051
02:25:07,498 --> 02:25:12,231
was born when this city was lost.

1052
02:25:12,336 --> 02:25:16,864
We fight over an offense
we did not give...

1053
02:25:16,974 --> 02:25:20,205
against those who were
not alive to be offended.

1054
02:25:22,613 --> 02:25:24,979
What is Jerusalem?

1055
02:25:25,082 --> 02:25:28,074
Your holy places lie
over the Jewish temple...

1056
02:25:28,185 --> 02:25:30,847
that the Romans pulled down.

1057
02:25:30,954 --> 02:25:33,548
The Muslim places of worship
lie over yours.

1058
02:25:36,059 --> 02:25:38,527
Which is more holy?

1059
02:25:41,031 --> 02:25:44,626
The wall? The mosque?

1060
02:25:44,735 --> 02:25:46,862
The sepulcher?

1061
02:25:46,970 --> 02:25:49,097
Who has claim?

1062
02:25:49,276 --> 02:25:51,574
No one has claim.

1063
02:25:52,913 --> 02:25:54,881
All have claim!

1064
02:25:54,981 --> 02:25:57,142
- That is blasphemy.
- Be quiet.

1065
02:25:57,250 --> 02:25:59,218
We defend this city...

1066
02:25:59,319 --> 02:26:01,981
not to protect these stones...

1067
02:26:02,088 --> 02:26:05,216
but the people living
within these walls.

1068
02:26:28,181 --> 02:26:30,649
My lord.
My lord, my lord.

1069
02:26:30,750 --> 02:26:35,744
How are we to defend Jerusalem
without knights?

1070
02:26:35,855 --> 02:26:38,517
- We have no knights!
- Truly?

1071
02:26:48,268 --> 02:26:51,931
- What is your condition?
- I'm servant to the patriarch.

1072
02:26:52,038 --> 02:26:54,734
He's, uh, one of my servants.

1073
02:26:54,841 --> 02:26:58,402
Is he?
You were born a servant?

1074
02:26:58,511 --> 02:27:00,945
Kneel.

1075
02:27:04,851 --> 02:27:07,684
Every man at arms...

1076
02:27:07,787 --> 02:27:09,778
or capable of bearing them...

1077
02:27:09,889 --> 02:27:11,789
kneel!

1078
02:27:15,795 --> 02:27:18,025
On your knees!

1079
02:27:24,671 --> 02:27:28,903
Be without fear
in the face of your enemies.

1080
02:27:29,009 --> 02:27:32,638
Be brave and upright
that God may love thee.

1081
02:27:34,180 --> 02:27:38,139
Speak the truth
even if it leads to your death.

1082
02:27:40,920 --> 02:27:42,820
Safeguard the helpless.

1083
02:27:42,922 --> 02:27:44,822
That is your oath.

1084
02:27:50,330 --> 02:27:52,491
And that is so you remember it.

1085
02:27:52,599 --> 02:27:55,659
Rise a knight.

1086
02:27:55,769 --> 02:27:57,430
Rise a knight!

1087
02:28:04,678 --> 02:28:08,273
- Master Gravedigger.
- It is you.

1088
02:28:08,381 --> 02:28:11,145
Not what I was.
Nor are you.

1089
02:28:11,251 --> 02:28:13,344
Rise a knight.

1090
02:28:15,889 --> 02:28:20,053
Who do you think you are?
Will you alter the world?

1091
02:28:20,160 --> 02:28:23,994
Does making a man a knight
make him a better fighter?

1092
02:28:30,904 --> 02:28:32,804
- Yes.
- [Sighs]

1093
02:29:07,974 --> 02:29:09,942
Almaric...

1094
02:29:12,645 --> 02:29:17,275
if you survive,
Ibelin is yours.

1095
02:29:19,552 --> 02:29:21,782
You are master of Ibelin.

1096
02:29:27,360 --> 02:29:29,328
I confirm it.

1097
02:29:30,864 --> 02:29:34,891
Rise a knight
and baron of Ibelin.

1098
02:29:36,836 --> 02:29:41,000
But it is a poor and dusty place.

1099
02:29:53,353 --> 02:29:57,551
- My lord?
- No.

1100
02:30:05,765 --> 02:30:08,256
When will it begin?

1101
02:30:12,539 --> 02:30:14,973
Soon.

1102
02:30:44,938 --> 02:30:46,929
Get them to the walls!

1103
02:30:48,508 --> 02:30:51,966
[Soldier]
Water! Bring water!

1104
02:30:53,446 --> 02:30:56,074
Get to the walls.

1105
02:30:58,184 --> 02:31:00,584
Push!

1106
02:31:02,488 --> 02:31:05,924
- Run!
- Push!

1107
02:31:22,508 --> 02:31:24,533
Why do they not fire back?

1108
02:31:24,644 --> 02:31:28,102
- They wait.
- [Man Shouts In Arabic]

1109
02:32:53,566 --> 02:32:58,333
That was only the first day.
There may be a hundred more.

1110
02:32:58,438 --> 02:33:01,896
Saladin will show no mercy.

1111
02:33:04,911 --> 02:33:06,879
We must hold out...

1112
02:33:06,980 --> 02:33:09,540
force him to offer terms.

1113
02:33:09,649 --> 02:33:11,549
What terms?

1114
02:33:11,651 --> 02:33:15,280
We fight for the people...
their safety and freedom.

1115
02:34:09,675 --> 02:34:11,609
- Mercy.
- No.

1116
02:34:11,711 --> 02:34:13,645
I cannot.

1117
02:35:02,462 --> 02:35:06,296
- Four hundred!

Who defends?

1130
02:37:52,698 --> 02:37:56,828
- Balian of Ibelin, the son of Godfrey.
- Godfrey.

1131
02:37:56,936 --> 02:38:00,372
Godfrey nearly killed me
in the Lebanon.

Truly, I did not know
he had a son.

1133
02:38:03,909 --> 02:38:05,740
It was his son at Kerak.

1134
02:38:09,749 --> 02:38:13,185
- The one you let live.
- Yes.

1135
02:38:13,286 --> 02:38:15,754
Perhaps you should not have.

1136
02:38:15,855 --> 02:38:19,655
Perhaps I should have had
a different teacher.

1137
02:40:38,464 --> 02:40:40,364
Fire!

1138
02:40:44,603 --> 02:40:47,128
Fire!

1139
02:40:47,239 --> 02:40:49,332
Fire!

1140
02:40:50,576 --> 02:40:52,567
Fire!

1141
02:40:52,678 --> 02:40:54,873
Now!

1142
02:41:53,839 --> 02:41:58,276
- You are not a sister.
- We are what we do.

1143
02:42:00,079 --> 02:42:03,310
Then I'm a man who's traveled
a long way to die for nothing.

1144
02:42:04,683 --> 02:42:06,776
What would you say to that?

1145
02:42:11,857 --> 02:42:14,052
I-I would say that I'm sorry.

1146
02:42:14,159 --> 02:42:16,150
And I'm sorry for you...

1147
02:42:18,564 --> 02:42:20,589
Queen of Jerusalem.

1148
02:43:10,783 --> 02:43:13,081
When a body is burnt...

1149
02:43:13,185 --> 02:43:16,518
it cannot be resurrected
until Judgment Day.

1150
02:43:16,622 --> 02:43:18,749
If we do not burn these bodies...

1151
02:43:18,857 --> 02:43:23,021
we will all be dead of disease
in three days.

1152
02:43:23,128 --> 02:43:25,926
God will understand, my lord.

1153
02:43:26,031 --> 02:43:27,999
And if he doesn't...

1154
02:43:28,100 --> 02:43:33,367
then he is not God,
and we need not worry.

1155
02:43:46,619 --> 02:43:49,053
- Salaam alaikum.
- Alaikum salaam.

1156
02:43:49,154 --> 02:43:52,920
The wall, where the Christopher Gate
used to be, has been weakened.

1157
02:43:53,025 --> 02:43:55,721
Usually when a gate is blocked in,
it is weaker than the wall around it.

1158
02:43:55,828 --> 02:44:00,288
- Or stronger.
- It is weaker. Rashid has seen it.

1159
02:44:00,399 --> 02:44:04,267
This will be our door into Jerusalem.

1160
02:44:13,312 --> 02:44:17,373
This is where
we will make our stand.

1161
02:44:17,483 --> 02:44:19,280
We must prepare.

1162
02:44:22,421 --> 02:44:25,254
Brothers! Brothers!

1163
02:44:25,357 --> 02:44:27,552
God has sent you this day!

1164
02:44:27,660 --> 02:44:30,128
You will take no prisoners!

1165
02:44:30,229 --> 02:44:33,426
As they did,
so shall it be done!

1166
02:44:33,532 --> 02:44:36,797
- Allah hu akbar!
- Allah hu akbar!

1167
02:45:14,373 --> 02:45:17,240
When this wall comes down...

1168
02:45:19,211 --> 02:45:21,611
there will be no quarter.

1169
02:45:21,714 --> 02:45:25,172
If you throw down your arms...

1170
02:45:25,284 --> 02:45:27,218
your families will die.

1171
02:45:31,390 --> 02:45:34,223
We can break this army here.

1172
02:45:38,130 --> 02:45:41,759
- [Loud Explosion]
- So I say let them come!

1173
02:45:41,867 --> 02:45:44,665
Let them come!

1174
02:45:44,770 --> 02:45:47,898
- Come on! Come on!
- [Cheering]

1175
02:45:48,006 --> 02:45:50,133
Come on!

1176
02:49:26,358 --> 02:49:31,455
Remember me in France,
Master Gravedigger.

1177
02:49:31,563 --> 02:49:33,224
My lord!

1178
02:50:05,597 --> 02:50:07,895
They will ask for terms.

1179
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:11,128
They must ask for terms.

1180
02:50:11,236 --> 02:50:15,332
Convert to Islam.
Repent later.

1181
02:50:17,542 --> 02:50:21,137
You've taught me a lot
about religion, Your Eminence.

1182
02:50:43,368 --> 02:50:46,166
Will you yield the city?

1183
02:50:50,042 --> 02:50:53,705
Before I lose it,
I will burn it to the ground.

1184
02:50:53,812 --> 02:50:56,110
Your holy places, ours.

1185
02:50:56,214 --> 02:50:59,377
Every last thing in Jerusalem
that drives men mad.

1186
02:51:01,219 --> 02:51:04,746
I wonder if it would not
be better if you did.

1187
02:51:04,856 --> 02:51:07,825
- You will destroy it?
- Every stone.

1188
02:51:07,926 --> 02:51:11,987
And every Christian knight you kill
will take 10 Saracens with him.

1189
02:51:12,097 --> 02:51:14,497
You will destroy your army here
and never raise another.

1190
02:51:14,599 --> 02:51:19,161
I swear to God that to take this city
will be the end of you.

1191
02:51:23,742 --> 02:51:26,370
Your city is full
of women and children.

1192
02:51:26,478 --> 02:51:29,345
If my army will die...

1193
02:51:29,448 --> 02:51:31,416
so will your city.

1194
02:51:36,188 --> 02:51:38,713
You offer terms.
I ask none.

1195
02:51:43,095 --> 02:51:47,259
I will give every soul
safe conduct to Christian lands.

1196
02:51:47,365 --> 02:51:49,629
Every soul...

1197
02:51:49,734 --> 02:51:52,601
the women,
the children, the old...

1198
02:51:52,704 --> 02:51:57,573
and all your knights and soldiers,
and your queen.

1199
02:51:57,676 --> 02:52:00,907
Your king,
such as he is...

1200
02:52:01,012 --> 02:52:03,173
I leave to you...

1201
02:52:03,281 --> 02:52:05,715
and what God
will make of him.

1202
02:52:05,817 --> 02:52:07,944
No one will be harmed.

1203
02:52:08,053 --> 02:52:10,317
I swear to God.

1204
02:52:10,422 --> 02:52:14,654
The Christians butchered every Muslim
within the walls when they took this city.

1205
02:52:14,759 --> 02:52:17,557
I am not those men.

1206
02:52:17,662 --> 02:52:20,130
I am Saladin.

1207
02:52:20,232 --> 02:52:22,894
Saladin.

1208
02:52:33,612 --> 02:52:37,708
Then under these terms,
I surrender Jerusalem.

1209
02:52:38,984 --> 02:52:40,884
Salaam alaikum.

1210
02:52:40,986 --> 02:52:43,716
And peace be with you.

1211
02:52:48,059 --> 02:52:50,493
What is Jerusalem worth?

1212
02:52:52,030 --> 02:52:53,930
Nothing.

1213
02:52:59,804 --> 02:53:01,704
Everything.

1214
02:53:42,447 --> 02:53:45,382
I have surrendered Jerusalem.

1215
02:53:45,483 --> 02:53:48,975
All will be safely
escorted to the sea.

1216
02:53:51,556 --> 02:53:54,320
If this is the kingdom of heaven...

1217
02:53:57,862 --> 02:54:00,330
let God do with it as he wills.

1218
02:54:12,444 --> 02:54:15,538
- [Cheering]
- Balian!

1219
02:54:15,647 --> 02:54:17,672
Balian!

1220
02:54:17,782 --> 02:54:20,046
[Patriarch]
Yes! Thanks to the Lord!

1221
02:54:35,567 --> 02:54:39,162
Your brother's kingdom
was here... and here.

1222
02:54:40,939 --> 02:54:44,238
That kingdom can never
be surrendered.

1223
02:54:50,715 --> 02:54:52,876
What should I do?

1224
02:54:55,520 --> 02:54:59,581
I'm still the queen of Acre,
Ashkelon, Tripoli.

1225
02:55:00,692 --> 02:55:03,388
Decide not to be a queen...

1226
02:55:03,495 --> 02:55:05,963
and I will come to you.

1227
02:55:35,260 --> 02:55:37,558
The perfect knight.

1228
02:55:37,662 --> 02:55:39,789
Is that what you
think you are, is it?

1229
02:55:54,779 --> 02:55:56,804
We are all of us what we do.

1230
02:57:07,018 --> 02:57:08,986
Do it.

1231
02:57:13,892 --> 02:57:16,190
When you rise again...

1232
02:57:16,294 --> 02:57:18,319
if you rise...

1233
02:57:19,931 --> 02:57:22,764
rise a knight.

1234
02:58:36,107 --> 02:58:38,701
This horse...

1235
02:58:40,778 --> 02:58:43,406
is not a very good horse.

1236
02:58:43,515 --> 02:58:45,779
I will not keep it.

1237
02:58:47,218 --> 02:58:50,016
Thank you.

1238
02:58:51,623 --> 02:58:53,853
And if God does not love you...

1239
02:58:53,958 --> 02:58:57,917
how could you have done all the things
that you have done?

1240
02:58:59,397 --> 02:59:01,627
Peace be upon you.

1241
02:59:03,067 --> 02:59:05,194
Alaikum salaam.

1242
03:01:16,334 --> 03:01:18,302
A queen never walks.

1243
03:01:25,343 --> 03:01:27,573
And yet you are walking.

1244
03:02:45,690 --> 03:02:49,023
- [Approaching Hoofbeats]
- [Man] Forward!

1245
03:02:50,495 --> 03:02:52,463
Forward!

1246
03:02:56,801 --> 03:02:58,769
[Man]
Halt!

1247
03:03:02,006 --> 03:03:04,941
We crusade to recover
the kingdom of Jerusalem.

1248
03:03:09,781 --> 03:03:12,909
You go to where
the men speak Italian...

1249
03:03:13,017 --> 03:03:16,680
and then continue
until they speak something else.

1250
03:03:24,629 --> 03:03:27,393
We've come by this road
to find Balian...

1251
03:03:27,498 --> 03:03:29,591
who was defender of Jerusalem.

1252
03:03:30,835 --> 03:03:33,736
I am the blacksmith.

1253
03:03:35,373 --> 03:03:38,274
And I am the king of England.

1254
03:03:38,376 --> 03:03:40,776
I am the blacksmith.

1255
03:03:44,048 --> 03:03:48,075
[Man]
Formation! Forward!
