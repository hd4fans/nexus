1
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:17,224
GOING PLACES

2
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,064
C'mere, sweetie!

3
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,797
Open up! Hurry!

4
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:37,281
I dream of you at night, Ursula.

5
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,618
I've been dreaming of you for months.

6
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,370
My name's not Ursula!

7
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,581
- What is it?
- Suzanne.

8
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,583
- How old are you?
- Dunno.

9
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,792
- Got kids?
- No.

10
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,252
- Why not?
- Dunno.

11
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,462
Oh, Ursula.

12
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,298
My Ursula.

13
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,175
15 francs.

14
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,470
Stupid bitch.

15
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,223
Bitches are cautious these days.

16
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,817
Screw-up after screw-up!

17
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,819
I'm sick of it!

18
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,741
Got a better idea?

19
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,495
Gimme money
and I'll come up with something.

20
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,623
THE HAIR COMPANY

21
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,750
Don't move...

22
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,086
What is it?

23
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,005
I have an idea.

24
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,633
What?

25
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,220
Look around. It's clear as day.

26
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,611
The engine's still warm.

27
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,950
Not again.

28
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,873
Isn't this great?

29
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:57,045
Feel that hydraulic suspension
under your ass?

30
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,966
Hydro pneumatics, man.

31
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,848
Don't be a scaredy-cat.

32
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,102
Did you shit your pants?

33
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,855
Don't worry.

34
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,190
We'll take the car back

35
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:21,028
and put it back exactly where it was.

36
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:24,072
The guy won't have time to report it.

37
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,772
Well?

38
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:01,777
Feel like a couple of idiots now?

39
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,250
Check out these two tough guys.

40
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,338
She's not bad, huh?

41
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,298
Only in your dreams.

42
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:29,262
I bet you'd love a feel...

43
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,641
In the meantime, hands up.

44
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,730
Bad timing, boys.

45
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,400
I just got my gun license.

46
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:45,529
Third time this year
someone steals my DS.

47
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,073
I've had my fill.

48
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,700
We didn't steal it.

49
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,411
We borrowed it.

50
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:56,039
We brought it back in one piece.

51
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,166
Exactly where we took it.

52
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,752
Save it for the cops.

53
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:04,506
- Go call them.
- That'd be stupid!

54
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,883
Don't get the cops involved.

55
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,845
We didn't hurt anyone.

56
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:14,850
We just went out for a spin,
to kill some time.

57
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:21,898
It's like you picked us up
hitchhiking on the side of the road.

58
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,984
Except you weren't there.

59
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,861
That's the only difference.

60
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,946
Let's not make a big deal of it.

61
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,740
We just used up some gas.

62
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,909
Not even a scratch.

63
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,247
You need to adjust the idle.

64
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:40,792
I've got a screwdriver.
I could do it right now.

65
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,044
Go on.
Don't listen to them.

66
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,089
Before you start crying
over their touching story.

67
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,633
- Please, miss...
- Hands up, I said!

68
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,845
- Want me to call the cops?
- Yeah.

69
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,680
-I'll call them.
-Wait!

70
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:58,226
I gotta tell you something first.

71
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:02,772
My pal and I got in trouble recently.

72
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:07,235
We got a suspended sentence.

73
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,030
- Next time it's jail.
- And we don't want that!

74
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,533
- We don't feel like it.
- You're pathetic.

75
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,994
I'll drive you there myself.

76
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,872
Give 'em haircuts first.

77
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,919
We're in France all right.

78
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:24,836
Watch out!

79
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,414
- Jean-Claude.
- What?

80
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,291
I'm bleeding bad.

81
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,752
- He needs a doctor.
- Mind your business!

82
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,171
What's all the racket?

83
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,555
Hide the DS and get us another car.

84
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,683
- Got any dough?
- I got something better.

85
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,000
Not leaving me with this guy,
are you?

86
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:29,127
What's wrong?

87
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,339
Don't I turn your crank?

88
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:48,146
What does endocrinology mean?

89
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,397
How should I know?

90
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,733
Hurry, it hurts bad.

91
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,367
Otorhinolaryngology?

92
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:04,329
We don't have a dictionary,
so screw their specialty!

93
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,665
I'm gushing blood here!

94
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,980
My pal here got shot.

95
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:15,525
Treat him or I'll smash your face
in front of your family.

96
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,286
A superficial wound in the left testicle.

97
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,997
Three stitches.

98
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,793
The bullet went in through his thigh,
avoiding the arteries.

99
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:37,255
- He lucked out.
- We always do.

100
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:38,965
We're lucky devils.

101
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,633
We got the Midas touch.

102
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,553
I'm glad to hear it.

103
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,597
For a minute there,
I was worried.

104
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:49,517
Our lucky streak continues...
Hand over your dough.

105
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:53,980
Sorry, I don't have any.

106
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,982
I never made it to the bank.

107
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,567
No kidding?

108
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:00,111
I'm even out of checks.

109
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:03,907
Or maybe you're taking me for a fool.

110
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,160
Search the place, then.

111
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,828
No...

112
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,584
I'd rather say hi to your two brats,
see if they've been tucked in.

113
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:19,422
Sometimes they have nightmares
and throw the covers off...

114
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,299
They might get sore throats.

115
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,884
Wait.

116
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,721
Bruno, give them something.

117
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,980
Here, it's the best I can do.

118
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,276
Wallet, Bruno...

119
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,954
You lowlife.

120
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,705
Goddamn lowlife.

121
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:56,626
That broad is a real dead fuck!

122
00:13:57,127 --> 00:14:00,505
She doesn't bite or scratch,
just spreads her legs!

123
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,883
Just counts the flies till you finish!

124
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,803
What're you whining about?

125
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,721
You got off, didn't you?

126
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,057
Like screwing a piece of meat!

127
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,443
Beat it.
My pal needs to rest.

128
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,304
That tramp.

129
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:53,099
Doesn't even wear panties.

130
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,684
Come...

131
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,085
I'd like to go now.

132
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,635
Why no panties?

133
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:36,392
Will you answer my goddamn question?

134
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,564
Here.

135
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:45,151
- Wanna see what your boyfriend did?
- Don't tire yourself out!

136
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,491
What if I can't fuck anymore?

137
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,867
Ever!

138
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:57,580
- That bitch has to see!
- The doc said you're fine!

139
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,792
I'm not the one who shot you!

140
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,503
I could care less about his stolen DS!

141
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:23,690
- Who was that guy?
- My boss.

142
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,693
- Does he do you?
- I'm not happy about it...

143
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,153
That why you don't wear panties?

144
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:34,367
It turns him on
when I walk around like that.

145
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,285
Even at that time of the month?

146
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,875
Hey, don't be gross.

147
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,088
Let's see your papers.

148
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,812
- What do you do?
- Shampoo girl.

149
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,647
What do you shampoo?

150
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,899
- Dicks?
- Bald heads?

151
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:18,411
I need to get some sleep.
The salon opens at 9.

152
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,204
Shut your face!

153
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,416
Shut your face.

154
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,811
Hearing voices or something?

155
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,151
Guess what we'll do to her pimp.

156
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,404
Guess.

157
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,540
Jean-Claude...

158
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,419
- Listen closely.
- I'm listening.

159
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,796
Listen closely.

160
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,132
The guy seemed nuts about his car.

161
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,134
So we'll return it.

162
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,971
We'll leave it by the side of the road.

163
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,973
- Follow me?
- Yeah...

164
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,726
Now for the good part.

165
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,230
The cops find the car,

166
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,482
the pimp picks it up at the station.

167
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,484
The car's intact.

168
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,112
He drives away with it.

169
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,823
He's really happy, whistling away.

170
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:41,410
But what the jerk doesn't know

171
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,163
is that we tampered with it.

172
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:48,126
We sawed off the front wheel.

173
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,507
It's hanging by a thread.

174
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,135
Get it?

175
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,679
It'll come off at any turn!

176
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:03,891
So one fine day,
the guy's driving down the highway...

177
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,102
90 mph, hanging loose,

178
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,770
puffin' on a cig...

179
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,940
A Marlboro man.

180
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,775
Then, bam!

181
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,361
The wheel breaks off!

182
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,283
Brilliant, huh? Brilliant!

183
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:23,286
In a turn! Plenty of trees!

184
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,455
You're right.
That asshole's got it coming.

185
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,042
Now come sit.
Don't wear yourself out.

186
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:59,822
Since we'll probably never see you again,

187
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:03,242
we want a little favor from you.

188
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,287
Now I'll be late for work...

189
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,081
What is it?

190
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:14,045
We wanna touch your ass hairs.
It brings good luck.

191
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,340
OK, but make it snappy.

192
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:20,384
I don't wanna get in trouble at work.

193
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:26,390
I didn't know
it was supposed to bring good luck.

194
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,601
Of course.

195
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:32,104
Touching something dirty
always brings good luck.

196
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:36,108
- It's like walking in shit.
- Bastards.

197
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,002
Sure you're in the right place?

198
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,840
My mistake.

199
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,385
- Nice ears.
- Oh, yeah?

200
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:05,846
- They stick out just right.
- Careful, or I might box yours.

201
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:10,142
- A haircut every Saturday?
- No, I work Saturdays.

202
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:14,105
Shoplifters galore.
I arrest hooligans like you by the dozen.

203
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,856
That's good.

204
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,819
If everyone worked as hard,
there'd be less waste.

205
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,407
Bet you're great at dice.

206
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,534
Who told you that?

207
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,412
I know your type.

208
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,915
I come across tons of guys like you.

209
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,168
So clingy.

210
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,087
Came here for a good thrashing?

211
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,506
No, a coat.

212
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,091
American-style.

213
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,052
A birthday present for my brother.

214
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,264
It's back there...

215
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,849
on the right.

216
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,351
- The right?
- After the TV sets.

217
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,395
I'll frisk you at the exit.

218
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,357
Look...

219
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:02,153
Just got your first paycheck?

220
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,030
God, no.

221
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,828
I met a high-society woman.

222
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,331
She's nuts about me.

223
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,043
Ursula gives me anything
my heart desires.

224
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,627
Good for you.

225
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,380
That badge is useless.

226
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,884
People can smell that Brylcreem
from 500 feet away.

227
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:28,179
You're lucky.
I'm in a good mood today.

228
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:32,058
So am I. Life is beautiful.
I could almost hug you.

229
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,978
Watch your nose.
I might be inclined to smack it.

230
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,147
Say...

231
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,316
Do you grope the salesgirls?

232
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,819
Watch out or I'll give you a swift kick.

233
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,529
Jerk.

234
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:50,201
- We've got nothing in common.
- That's for sure.

235
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:54,163
- Yet I'm kinda fond of you.
- Likewise...

236
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:57,500
I feel like...

237
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,251
being closer to you.

238
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:03,923
If I weren't in a hurry,
I'd invite you to dinner.

239
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,964
You goddamn bastard!

240
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,133
Isn't this nice?

241
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,394
You see?

242
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:01,480
When people leave us alone,
the simple things make us happy.

243
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,789
It's hopeless!

244
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:22,418
They're like flies around shit!

245
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:25,171
It's like the world would come
crashing down if we died!

246
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:28,048
Slow down, will ya?

247
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,819
- My balls hurt.
- Pedal standing up!

248
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:56,827
I win the Pernod trophy!

249
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:18,933
Jerk!

250
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,578
Shit!

251
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:27,084
This is how people get caught.

252
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:45,037
That's mean.
He's still thirsty.

253
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,460
Don't go.

254
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:54,922
We just want Baby Jesus
to quench his thirst.

255
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,218
Take this
and give him something to drink.

256
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:03,222
- I don't want that.
- Please.

257
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,725
Come on, don't make such a fuss.

258
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:34,586
Your tits are hot.

259
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,426
I'm meeting up with my husband.

260
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,178
He's doing his military service.

261
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:45,472
In Angelras.

262
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:47,850
Is that right?

263
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:06,869
Isn't it cozier like this?

264
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,371
Isn't this nice?

265
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,465
What do you want?

266
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,761
Nothing.

267
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,765
Is it a crime
to contemplate my cash?

268
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,425
Is your husband on leave?

269
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,553
Yes.

270
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,889
When did you last see him?

271
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,767
Two months ago.

272
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,564
Rock 'n' roll.

273
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,359
Where will you go?

274
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,237
Dunno...

275
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,739
To a hotel.

276
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:11,910
Here.

277
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,288
For you.

278
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,915
What for?

279
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:32,431
I want you

280
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:36,268
to spend that leave
in the city's fanciest hotel.

281
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:41,815
In the most expensive suite,
with a private bathroom.

282
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,651
To scrub your stinky husband clean.

283
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,362
So you can get off on a spacious bed

284
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,865
and have champagne
brought up on a silver tray,

285
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,367
which you'll drink in the sack.

286
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,954
Interested?

287
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,750
- Yes...
- "Yes"?

288
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,341
But you'll have to earn this money.

289
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:09,134
How?

290
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:12,137
Breast-feed my pal here.

291
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:17,476
He loves milk,
plus he never knew his mom.

292
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,356
Whaddaya say, old man?

293
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,861
Yeah...

294
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,322
Go for it, then.

295
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,272
Don't you like it?

296
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,984
I'm not getting hard.

297
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:42,037
Angelras!

298
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:44,081
I have to get off!

299
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,684
That soldier's gonna get his rocks off.

300
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,771
We warmed her up for him.

301
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,651
What about me?

302
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:16,029
Why can't I get a boner?

303
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,453
That asshole pimp!

304
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:27,499
I hope he wipes out at a turn.

305
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:31,503
- Think he got his car back?
- No, it's way too soon.

306
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:34,714
- Cops are so fuckin' slow!
- There's no fire!

307
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,883
There is!

308
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,345
I can't wait to see him
in the accidents section.

309
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,559
- Got friends in the area?
- No.

310
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:49,187
- Why'd we come here, then?
- Gimme time.

311
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,273
I'm not a computer.

312
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:53,400
Just quit worrying.

313
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:17,424
Platform 4, train No. 1411.

314
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,718
Destination: Bridolle.

315
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:23,388
The train is about to leave.

316
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:25,223
Are you nuts?

317
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:39,821
What does "off-season" mean to you?

318
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:41,907
The million-dollar question.

319
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,829
A first-class town if ever I saw one.

320
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,274
Quaint, huh?

321
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,872
The cheapskates didn't even
leave any sugar behind.

322
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:17,836
But they did leave some
soundproof double-ply toilet paper.

323
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,133
How touching.

324
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,304
Granddad, Grandma,

325
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,847
Jacqueline...

326
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,059
Poor Jacqueline.

327
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,980
All alone with those old geezers.

328
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:41,693
That's where little Jackie sleeps.

329
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:06,551
Look what the sweetie pie left us.

330
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,352
Isn't that cute?

331
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,396
How old would you guess?

332
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,483
Dunno.

333
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,068
13...

334
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:26,404
14 at most.

335
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,406
Let's see...

336
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,040
She's much older, Pierrot.

337
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:38,583
Much older.

338
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,252
She's at least 16.

339
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,422
Have a whiff.

340
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:49,052
You're right.

341
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:51,429
Holy cow.

342
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,765
She's at least...

343
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:58,061
Jacqueline's a real lady.

344
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,774
It's like she just took them off,

345
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,235
like she's in the next room.

346
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,154
Jacqueline!

347
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,286
Jean-Claude...

348
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,248
Jean-Claude!

349
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:21,376
I can't get it up.

350
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,753
So? Neither can I.

351
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,424
What would we need to get it up for?

352
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,677
I usually get a morning hard-on.

353
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:34,514
It's too dirty, that's why.

354
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:39,561
You got so much shit on that thing,
you'd need a bulldozer to get it off.

355
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:45,400
Come on in.
This feels fantastic.

356
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:48,111
I can't.
My wound'll bleed!

357
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:51,656
Your feet won't bleed.

358
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:55,160
Clean them up a bit,
purify the air...

359
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,830
Don't worry.
It'll come back.

360
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,751
No reason why it shouldn't.

361
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:06,004
It's just psychosomatic.

362
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:11,009
It's because you can't get your mind off it.

363
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:17,390
Feels good, huh?

364
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:28,318
Takes a weight off, right?

365
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,911
See how handsome you are?

366
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:43,041
You almost turn me on...

367
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:47,337
- Take your hand off.
- What hand?

368
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,341
Take your hand off, fag.

369
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:58,640
- No need to be ashamed...
- It's not about shame.

370
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:01,267
I just don't feel like it.

371
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,894
How would you know?

372
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:05,563
If you've never tried...

373
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:10,151
Really think you can turn me on?

374
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,987
I want a woman. Get it?

375
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:15,990
Something attractive,
not repulsive.

376
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,078
Someone just came in.

377
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,633
I'll show you, old fag!

378
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,553
I feel humiliated!

379
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:41,057
Come on,
it's only natural between friends.

380
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:44,686
And I hate this town!

381
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:48,022
Lousy stinkin' town!

382
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,736
Lousy stinkin' France!

383
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,949
I get screwed everywhere I go!

384
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,827
Shut up or you're eating sand.

385
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:08,835
Jean-Claude...

386
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:12,797
- Why can't I get it up?
- I told you it'd come back!

387
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:16,426
Fuckin' pain!

388
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:21,139
What I need is a broad.

389
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:22,807
A hot one.

390
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:24,809
A broad who loves me.

391
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:34,235
There must be some goddamn tail somewhere!

392
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,237
Obviously!

393
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:39,490
But how to get it
without attracting attention?

394
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:45,330
We can't become priests
just to avoid the pigs.

395
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:01,095
And we're running low on funds.

396
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,681
- How much have we got?
- 100 francs.

397
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:05,850
Holy shit!

398
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,150
What?

399
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:16,194
I've got it.

400
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:18,029
- "Got" what?
- Everything!

401
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,073
Listen here...

402
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:24,494
We want some tail.
I found some tail.

403
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:28,039
We're out of dough.
I found some dough.

404
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:29,666
Come on.

405
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,974
Hey, what're you doing?

406
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,691
That's my bike...

407
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:56,275
Guys!

408
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,264
Hi.

409
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:47,118
Door!

410
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,445
If you wanna screw, go ahead.

411
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:34,791
None of your lip.

412
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,335
We didn't come for that.

413
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:40,004
We'll screw if we feel like it.

414
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,465
- Whaddaya want, then?
- News of your boyfriend.

415
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:43,549
- Which one?
- Your pimp!

416
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,551
He's not my pimp.
He can screw himself!

417
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,929
And screw you too, dirty fags!

418
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,352
Say that again.

419
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:56,854
What'd you say?

420
00:46:58,524 --> 00:46:59,857
Nothing.

421
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:02,401
They're small,
but it hurts anyway, huh?

422
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:06,531
- You're a whore, right?
- Yes!

423
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,200
Repeat it!

424
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,994
- You're a hooker, right?
- Yes, a dirty hooker.

425
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,580
- Who sucks hairdressers.
- "Who sucks hairdressers."

426
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:17,041
- Who doesn't wear panties.
- "Who doesn't wear panties."

427
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,550
You slut.

428
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:35,059
- Your pimp got his car back?
- Yes.

429
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:37,353
- Is he happy?
- About what?

430
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:40,606
- Getting his nice car back.
- I could care less.

431
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,984
Answer me!

432
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,529
He sold it.

433
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:52,118
- He sold his DS?
- Yes.

434
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:56,080
- To who?
- To some car salesman.

435
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:01,878
Filthy bastard.

436
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:10,720
When I think of the poor people
who'll buy that scrap heap.

437
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:20,563
Do I take off the rest or what?

438
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:26,944
Here you were whining
about your rod for two weeks.

439
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:31,282
Take it easy.
I'm getting seasick.

440
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:38,331
Calm down.
Don't get so excited.

441
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:43,419
Take your time.

442
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:46,422
Negotiate.

443
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,810
Wow. Great performance.

444
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,396
3.5 minutes.

445
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:04,565
That's what I call a sprinter.

446
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:09,236
You got there so fast,
she never left the starting gate.

447
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:12,740
- I'll go again!
- After me, if you don't mind.

448
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:18,829
Watch and learn, old man.

449
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:23,125
Admire the professionalism...

450
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:28,089
It's all about finesse.

451
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:29,674
Nice and easy does it.

452
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:33,302
We have the whole night ahead of us.

453
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:38,432
First you rev her up,

454
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:39,934
to get the juices flowing!

455
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:43,312
Then back into first...

456
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:47,608
You gotta make her want it.

457
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:49,527
Right, sweetie?

458
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:52,905
Then back into high gear!

459
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,253
- Am I hurting you?
- No...

460
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:09,213
- Sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

461
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:13,384
- 'Cause they usually suffocate.
- No, I'm fine.

462
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:19,056
You realize you're in the hands of a stud?

463
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:26,981
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

464
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,735
Why are you always like that...?

465
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:33,863
Like what?

466
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:35,448
Dunno...

467
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:38,242
You just lie there.

468
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:42,079
She could care less
for your smooth talk.

469
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:44,081
She prefers me.

470
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:47,460
Then be my guest, old man.

471
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,420
She's all yours.

472
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,554
Make her come
and I'll buy you a bottle.

473
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:06,228
Look at that...

474
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:10,441
What a cold fish.

475
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:15,654
Can't you make an effort,
show a bit more enthusiasm?

476
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:18,991
How, with you yelling in our ears?

477
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,494
Quit bugging us.

478
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:24,789
I'll go pee.
At least I'll feel something.

479
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:31,587
Only yogurt in here.

480
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:36,383
If you're bored, just say so.

481
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:39,261
No, not at all...

482
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:44,767
Well, that's not working.
Flip over.

483
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:55,861
- Her eyes closed?
- No.

484
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:58,572
- Biting her lips?
- No.

485
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:01,742
- Sweating under the arms?
- No.

486
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:04,161
Shit, I give up!

487
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,791
Why bother wearing my rod out?

488
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:11,502
She's a hole with pubes around it.

489
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:13,754
An unfeeling aperture.

490
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:17,299
A patient on an operating table!

491
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:20,052
I bet she could stay like that for hours.

492
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,972
You can flip over.
The fuck is over.

493
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:25,516
Have you no modesty?

494
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:28,978
Please. She could care less.

495
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:38,654
Sorry we're not more romantic,
Marie-Ange...

496
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:43,951
- Don't you ever get off?
- Dunno...

497
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:45,995
I don't mind.

498
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:51,667
- What do other girls do?
- They enjoy themselves!

499
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:54,295
They moan,
thank you with their eyes...

500
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:58,007
Their eyes roll back
till you see the whites.

501
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:01,010
Just teach me.

502
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:07,933
- Wanna try?
- No way.

503
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,768
She's all yours.

504
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:13,022
Fine...

505
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,584
C'mere, boy.

506
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:36,587
You like that, huh?

507
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:01,028
- Kiss me.
- Not now.

508
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:02,613
Where's the till?

509
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:05,407
Everything in its own time.

510
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,409
First the cash.

511
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,167
There's only change.

512
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:19,046
Could be a booby trap.

513
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:21,799
- Try with your knife.
- Obviously.

514
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:24,718
- There an alarm on here?
- There an alarm?

515
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:30,641
Hey, is there an alarm on it?

516
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,811
Well, anybody in there?

517
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:35,854
Fuck you.

518
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:38,774
That clear? Fuck you!

519
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,694
I'll give you an alarm right now!

520
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:47,950
- You lost your mind?
- I wanted you to kiss me!

521
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:50,703
I'm not some goddamn revolving cunt!

522
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:53,163
Stop it!

523
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:05,134
Stop or I'll shoot you!

524
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:11,932
Bastard...

525
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:17,646
Bastard!

526
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,450
You can't abandon me here.

527
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:33,412
You can't leave me here, guys!

528
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:33,389
Wanna play another one?

529
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:35,974
Listen, chicks, it's 11.

530
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:39,728
We can't spend all night
clowning around with balls.

531
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:43,774
Since we'll end up in bed anyway,
let's not waste any more time.

532
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:46,652
How presumptuous!

533
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:50,781
- You think all girls are that easy?
- Of course they are!

534
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:52,199
Obviously.

535
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:55,661
We just bought a new car,
great seats...

536
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:57,246
As good as sofas.

537
00:56:57,789 --> 00:57:00,499
- Can you believe it?
- You got a screw loose?

538
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:03,794
To tell you the truth,

539
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:05,838
we could care less.

540
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:09,675
Sex or no sex,
it's no skin off our noses.

541
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:13,554
'Cause we've had enough
of dead weight like you!

542
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:15,889
Know what I mean by "dead weight"?

543
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:19,143
Girls who just lie there!

544
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,689
I'm not ruining anything, old man.

545
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:26,984
The place is full of girls like them.

546
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:28,318
Look around.

547
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:31,029
They've been ogling us for over an hour.

548
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:34,074
Don't think you're so special.

549
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,994
Come on, Ginette, we're going.

550
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:40,122
You do that, and good riddance.

551
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,793
Know what you are? Hicks!

552
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:47,921
Now that's a good one.

553
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:50,966
You didn't even remove the price tags.

554
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:00,559
What about your drinks?

555
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:04,605
- So we're stuck with the check.
- You're an idiot!

556
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:07,191
- We were gonna screw 'em.
- Screw what?

557
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:09,902
More dead meat? No, thanks.

558
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:12,196
We can't spend our lives doing dead meat.

559
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:14,198
But you don't care.

560
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:17,284
You'd fuck anything.

561
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:20,913
But I wanna hear her whimper.

562
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:24,583
You know, that sound
that comes from deep down,

563
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,376
like a creature that you strangle,

564
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,046
that goes...

565
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,756
Excuse me, miss.

566
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:34,927
At night,
do you sometimes go...?

567
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:37,471
You're nuts!

568
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:40,599
And you wanna bother with that?

569
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:42,726
It's not worth it, Pierrot.

570
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,978
We're better than that.

571
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,688
Life is too short.

572
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,941
No more shampoo girls.

573
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:51,401
Know what you need?

574
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:57,658
You need to spend the night
with a real woman.

575
00:58:57,742 --> 00:59:00,077
- A tiger!
- I'm all for it!

576
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:02,496
Not the type that goes...

577
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:04,122
A fighter.

578
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,833
You don't know which end is up.

579
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:10,003
You think it's over,
but she swoops in again!

580
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:12,798
A woman who wants it bad.

581
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:16,927
A woman who hasn't had it
in a long time...

582
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:20,180
- An old bag, you mean.
- I never said an old bag.

583
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:21,723
A nun, then.

584
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:24,560
They must be hungry for it too.

585
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:27,229
- Count me out.
- Hold on.

586
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:29,690
I'm on the verge of something.

587
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:33,735
- What, a new idea?
- It's simple, old man.

588
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:37,990
If I'm not mistaken,
it's my best yet.

589
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:40,492
My masterpiece.

590
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,619
Go on, tell me.

591
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:47,374
A woman like you've never dreamed of...

592
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:49,793
- Someone you know?
- No.

593
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:52,254
But we'll soon meet her.

594
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:55,382
- How much do we owe you?
- We're going right now?

595
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:58,051
No choice, it's 700 km away.

596
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:04,266
Where are we going?

597
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:07,394
What's this brilliant idea?

598
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:09,229
A reservoir...

599
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:11,231
A private hunting ground.

600
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:13,817
300 women. That ring a bell?

601
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:16,111
All dying for it.

602
01:00:17,238 --> 01:00:20,449
You barely touch 'em
and they explode!

603
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:24,286
Stick your finger in and it burns.

604
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:26,538
"300 women"?

605
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,332
You gone bonkers?

606
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:44,348
We can't do an old lady.

607
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:08,265
She's so plain.

608
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:12,102
I find her beautiful.

609
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:29,202
What do you want?

610
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:32,038
Nothing.
Just to help you.

611
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:34,958
- Why?
- No reason.

612
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,420
We saw you being released.

613
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:41,965
I don't want your help.

614
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:46,595
She's a loon.

615
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:48,472
Who wouldn't be?

616
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:07,240
Who are you?

617
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:10,243
Nobody. Just two friends.

618
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:12,537
Can't you leave me alone?

619
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,539
Especially today.

620
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,625
Can't you see you're bothering her?

621
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:18,668
Shut up and get the car.

622
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,213
Unbelievable.

623
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:24,424
Un-fucking-believable!

624
01:03:30,097 --> 01:03:31,389
Wait!

625
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:38,230
Don't be scared.

626
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:40,315
There's no reason to be.

627
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:44,027
Put this on before you catch a cold.

628
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:57,707
Where are you going?

629
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:03,046
Do you even know?

630
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:06,007
No.

631
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:07,592
Got any money?

632
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:10,637
50 francs.

633
01:04:10,721 --> 01:04:12,305
Got anyone to call?

634
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:14,516
No.

635
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:16,768
We'll take care of you.

636
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:20,313
I'm sick of being taken care of.

637
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:22,232
Come on.

638
01:04:22,733 --> 01:04:24,901
My friend'll be back with a car.

639
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:27,863
Heated, with nice seats.

640
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:31,032
And you need a change of clothes.

641
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:33,827
- Got any in that suitcase?
- No.

642
01:04:33,911 --> 01:04:35,120
There you go.

643
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:38,498
No money, no clothes,
no place to go...

644
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:41,334
You're in a fix.

645
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:44,588
- What do you suggest?
- Everything.

646
01:04:45,798 --> 01:04:48,592
My friend and I are at your disposal.

647
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:54,264
We've got a car and plenty of cash.

648
01:04:58,102 --> 01:04:59,811
I don't trust you.

649
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:04,649
Need help?

650
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:07,777
Hey, beat it!

651
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:11,323
- Leave us alone!
- Why are you so rude?

652
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:14,743
I said, "Beat it!"

653
01:05:19,957 --> 01:05:22,459
Why's he pushing us?

654
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,301
Here.

655
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:34,304
Now do you trust me?

656
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:13,176
OK, first things first.

657
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:16,346
What would you most like to do?

658
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:19,474
Nothing special.

659
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:21,768
We can't drive around all day.

660
01:06:21,852 --> 01:06:25,230
- Let me off, if you like.
- No, that's not what I meant.

661
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:28,775
I simply wanted to know...

662
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:31,736
Can't you leave her alone?

663
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:35,448
You insisted she get in,
so you make the plans.

664
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:37,826
Yeah, you're right.

665
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:41,162
First we need to get you
some warm clothes.

666
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:43,957
- You must be cold.
- A bit.

667
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:47,627
- And my feet are sore.
- That's it, we'll go shopping.

668
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:24,914
We should really split.

669
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:28,251
I don't like the woman.

670
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:31,129
She gives me the creeps.
I don't trust her.

671
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:33,673
If you ask me, she's trouble.

672
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:35,383
Split if you want.

673
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:37,552
You can keep the car.

674
01:07:57,281 --> 01:07:58,740
No.

675
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:03,912
Thanks.

676
01:10:42,446 --> 01:10:43,613
Easy.

677
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:47,659
- Why?
- Take it easy.

678
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:49,535
You have to take your time.

679
01:10:51,121 --> 01:10:52,914
You're right.

680
01:11:12,142 --> 01:11:13,935
All done.

681
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:24,904
You OK?

682
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:26,239
Yeah.

683
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:30,743
Thank you.

684
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:32,328
For what?

685
01:11:33,163 --> 01:11:35,540
For everything, the meal...

686
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:38,501
I don't get it, but thank you.

687
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:43,256
You're beautiful.

688
01:11:44,091 --> 01:11:45,591
No...

689
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:48,177
Not exactly fetching.

690
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:54,809
How old are you?

691
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:57,437
25.

692
01:11:57,521 --> 01:11:59,355
- And you?
- 23.

693
01:12:02,192 --> 01:12:04,527
How old do you think I am?

694
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:14,037
The tide's up.

695
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:23,254
What do you do?

696
01:12:24,548 --> 01:12:27,592
You, for example.
Do you work?

697
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:31,512
He's a mechanic.

698
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:33,848
We work in a garage together.

699
01:12:35,934 --> 01:12:38,394
- Is business good?
- Not bad.

700
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:50,365
Would you consider
sleeping with an old broad?

701
01:12:53,243 --> 01:12:54,577
Yes,

702
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:57,955
but I don't see any around here.

703
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:00,625
- You?
- No.

704
01:13:06,423 --> 01:13:08,007
'Bye, ma'am.

705
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:09,884
- Thank you so much.
- No, thank you.

706
01:13:09,968 --> 01:13:13,554
No, I insist.

707
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:17,350
Lunching here was wonderful.

708
01:13:17,434 --> 01:13:23,773
I just spent 10 years in prison,
in a cold and damp cell.

709
01:13:23,857 --> 01:13:27,110
I haven't had a period in ages.

710
01:13:27,444 --> 01:13:29,821
At first I was just late.

711
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:32,824
They sent me to the infirmary.
They gave me aspirin.

712
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:38,162
Then I was later and later:
two, three weeks, a month...

713
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:44,127
I gradually stopped thinking about it,
until they stopped altogether.

714
01:13:44,628 --> 01:13:46,838
Why tell me all this?

715
01:13:47,297 --> 01:13:52,677
Just so you understand how lucky you are
to have regular periods,

716
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:55,054
even if it makes you crabby.

717
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:59,851
That stuff's not important:
mood swings, jumpiness, cramps...

718
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:02,228
That's nothing.

719
01:14:02,312 --> 01:14:05,857
The worst part
is not having periods anymore.

720
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:07,650
Good-bye, ma'am.

721
01:14:48,942 --> 01:14:50,610
Easy, easy...

722
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:53,196
Easy.

723
01:21:42,355 --> 01:21:45,608
- I got my period, by the way.
- Shut the fuck up!

724
01:21:50,697 --> 01:21:52,489
It's all over...

725
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:55,451
It'll be all right.

726
01:22:55,845 --> 01:22:57,513
Shit.

727
01:22:57,973 --> 01:23:00,140
Son or daughter?

728
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:02,393
It's signed "Jacques."

729
01:23:09,526 --> 01:23:10,693
They're all from Jacques.

730
01:23:10,777 --> 01:23:13,612
- How old is he?
- He's just a kid.

731
01:23:42,892 --> 01:23:44,393
Jacques Pirolle?

732
01:23:45,937 --> 01:23:47,521
Yes, that's me.

733
01:23:50,650 --> 01:23:51,984
Your mom sent us.

734
01:23:52,068 --> 01:23:53,652
Where is she?

735
01:23:53,737 --> 01:23:56,405
- Wasn't she released?
- Yes, but she's abroad.

736
01:23:56,489 --> 01:23:58,574
- Where?
- Portugal.

737
01:23:58,658 --> 01:24:00,159
She could've written.

738
01:24:00,243 --> 01:24:03,829
Not a word in three months.
What's she doing in Portugal?

739
01:24:03,913 --> 01:24:06,707
She left with a friend of ours,

740
01:24:06,791 --> 01:24:09,501
a great guy, an agronomist.

741
01:24:10,336 --> 01:24:12,880
- What's his name?
- Loiseleux.

742
01:24:12,964 --> 01:24:15,841
Don't worry, he's very reliable.

743
01:24:15,925 --> 01:24:18,802
He spent two years in Cuba
as a technical advisor.

744
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:22,222
Now he's on a job in Sierra Leone.

745
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:24,850
If he's so great,
why doesn't he work in France?

746
01:24:24,934 --> 01:24:27,311
'Cause he's got a record.

747
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:30,689
- What'd he get?
- One year inside, two on parole.

748
01:24:30,774 --> 01:24:33,692
OK... What kind of car you got?

749
01:24:33,777 --> 01:24:36,111
- American.
- Let's go.

750
01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:38,530
And what do you do?

751
01:24:38,615 --> 01:24:41,617
Nothing. We've been waiting
three months for you.

752
01:26:32,937 --> 01:26:35,564
Her name's Marie-Ange.

753
01:26:35,648 --> 01:26:39,318
She's our girl.
Now she's yours too.

754
01:26:39,402 --> 01:26:41,486
She's consenting.

755
01:26:41,571 --> 01:26:44,698
She's no goddess,
but there are worse lays.

756
01:26:44,782 --> 01:26:47,367
Only one little hitch:

757
01:26:48,077 --> 01:26:49,995
She never comes.

758
01:26:50,663 --> 01:26:55,334
So if she's quiet and still,
that's just the way she is.

759
01:26:55,418 --> 01:26:57,169
We've been trying for weeks...

760
01:26:57,253 --> 01:26:59,713
A total washout.

761
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:02,132
Hi...

762
01:27:03,301 --> 01:27:06,136
- Care for some coffee?
- Sure.

763
01:27:12,894 --> 01:27:15,437
- Not hungry?
- I am.

764
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:18,273
- Want some jam?
- Dunno.

765
01:27:23,446 --> 01:27:26,949
I think the newbie
wants a tour of the place.

766
01:27:27,283 --> 01:27:29,910
You should show him around.

767
01:27:59,607 --> 01:28:01,900
We share everything here.

768
01:28:22,547 --> 01:28:24,715
Go ahead.
It's our pleasure.

769
01:28:33,266 --> 01:28:35,225
Doggie-style is her forte.

770
01:28:35,893 --> 01:28:37,728
I highly recommend it.

771
01:29:30,948 --> 01:29:35,243
The first cigarette of the day
is always the best.

772
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:38,789
Yeah...

773
01:29:39,999 --> 01:29:42,042
Gets your mouth into shape.

774
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:48,548
- Did you hear that?
- What?

775
01:29:48,633 --> 01:29:50,092
Listen...

776
01:31:09,005 --> 01:31:10,547
Pierrot!

777
01:31:11,174 --> 01:31:12,507
Jean-Claude!

778
01:31:13,301 --> 01:31:18,263
I did it!

779
01:31:18,681 --> 01:31:22,184
It happened!

780
01:31:22,268 --> 01:31:25,437
- What happened?
- I came!

781
01:31:25,521 --> 01:31:27,355
You're a goddamn pain!

782
01:31:30,026 --> 01:31:31,818
That'll cool you off!

783
01:31:33,571 --> 01:31:34,779
I came!

784
01:31:34,864 --> 01:31:37,866
- What the hell did he do to you?
- Nothing special.

785
01:31:37,950 --> 01:31:39,993
- The usual?
- I swear.

786
01:31:40,077 --> 01:31:42,454
Impossible.
He must have some trick.

787
01:31:42,538 --> 01:31:44,581
- No...
- We know all the tricks.

788
01:31:44,957 --> 01:31:47,209
- Actually, I did everything.
- How's that?

789
01:31:47,293 --> 01:31:52,088
- You usually just lie there.
- Exactly, he was doing the same.

790
01:31:52,173 --> 01:31:54,758
- Stage fright?
- I'll say.

791
01:31:55,843 --> 01:31:57,761
He was shaking all over.

792
01:31:58,804 --> 01:32:02,557
He was looking at my body,
but he was scared to touch me.

793
01:32:03,976 --> 01:32:06,228
I had to undress him myself.

794
01:32:10,149 --> 01:32:11,816
Then all of a sudden,

795
01:32:12,902 --> 01:32:15,487
he came in my hands...

796
01:32:16,822 --> 01:32:20,450
- He apologized...
- That's not what made you come.

797
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:22,244
Let me finish!

798
01:32:23,871 --> 01:32:27,374
So I held him against me

799
01:32:28,042 --> 01:32:32,254
and said,
"Crying'll make you feel good."

800
01:32:32,922 --> 01:32:37,759
So he started crying,
but while awkwardly making love to me.

801
01:32:38,928 --> 01:32:42,472
And just as suddenly,
he came a second time.

802
01:32:42,890 --> 01:32:44,558
After about a minute.

803
01:32:45,726 --> 01:32:48,270
- How complicated.
- I'm not finished!

804
01:32:48,938 --> 01:32:51,523
It all started after our third try.

805
01:32:52,858 --> 01:32:55,110
I asked if I was his first woman.

806
01:32:55,486 --> 01:32:57,279
He said yes

807
01:32:57,738 --> 01:33:01,157
and started making love to me again.

808
01:33:01,242 --> 01:33:04,202
Slowly, while kissing me.

809
01:33:04,787 --> 01:33:07,872
- And then...
- We get the picture.

810
01:33:07,957 --> 01:33:09,457
But then...!

811
01:33:10,376 --> 01:33:12,294
I swear...!

812
01:34:40,216 --> 01:34:42,050
Shall I serve you?

813
01:34:42,134 --> 01:34:44,886
If it's not too much trouble.

814
01:34:46,222 --> 01:34:49,349
Any meat left in there?

815
01:34:49,433 --> 01:34:51,851
Seems you have a gun?

816
01:34:51,936 --> 01:34:54,562
- Who told you that?
- The girl.

817
01:34:56,399 --> 01:34:57,899
Great going.

818
01:35:02,029 --> 01:35:03,571
Not bad.

819
01:35:05,366 --> 01:35:06,866
Yeah...

820
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:09,744
But nothing to write home about.

821
01:35:16,919 --> 01:35:18,795
Interested in our gun?

822
01:35:20,589 --> 01:35:22,257
Yes, actually.

823
01:35:27,263 --> 01:35:28,596
Why?

824
01:35:29,432 --> 01:35:31,766
'Cause it's a work tool.

825
01:35:39,275 --> 01:35:41,568
Plan on getting back to work?

826
01:35:42,111 --> 01:35:45,613
Someone has to.
We're flat broke.

827
01:35:47,158 --> 01:35:50,493
How does an old couple's nest egg sound?

828
01:35:52,788 --> 01:35:54,038
Depends.

829
01:35:56,375 --> 01:35:59,127
I got a tip from a cellmate.

830
01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:03,298
Easy and risk-free.
They're retired and defenseless.

831
01:36:06,469 --> 01:36:09,137
We'll take stock of the risks ourselves.

832
01:36:10,347 --> 01:36:12,390
I don't mind going alone,

833
01:36:12,475 --> 01:36:15,685
but I need a gun to persuade them.

834
01:36:22,985 --> 01:36:24,527
Do we lend it to him?

835
01:36:24,612 --> 01:36:27,489
I don't give a shit.
It's your decision.

836
01:36:34,663 --> 01:36:36,706
Here. Good luck.

837
01:36:41,670 --> 01:36:43,004
Thanks.

838
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:52,347
I told you they'd chicken out.

839
01:36:57,019 --> 01:36:58,478
Let's go.

840
01:38:11,218 --> 01:38:12,635
Pirolle!

841
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:16,097
Now that's what I call a surprise.

842
01:38:16,181 --> 01:38:17,765
I'm with friends.

843
01:38:19,143 --> 01:38:20,643
I'll be right out.

844
01:38:22,730 --> 01:38:25,940
Hey, what's going on here?

845
01:38:28,944 --> 01:38:30,737
Pirolle!

846
01:38:31,155 --> 01:38:32,947
Jean-Claude, Pierrot...

847
01:38:33,574 --> 01:38:35,074
Hello, boys.

848
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:37,118
Good timing, I have champagne.

849
01:38:39,246 --> 01:38:40,705
Well, come in.

850
01:38:48,213 --> 01:38:49,631
Jacques...

851
01:38:51,091 --> 01:38:52,634
Is this some kind of joke?

852
01:38:54,303 --> 01:38:56,554
Better get your cash and fast!

853
01:38:56,639 --> 01:38:59,682
- What cash?
- Forget the cash.

854
01:39:00,684 --> 01:39:02,518
Come on, Jacques... Pirolle.

855
01:39:03,729 --> 01:39:06,272
I've never done anything to hurt you.

856
01:39:06,357 --> 01:39:08,566
Get the chaplain, if you want.

857
01:39:12,738 --> 01:39:15,448
Tell him there was another suicide attempt,

858
01:39:16,158 --> 01:39:18,868
that the victim needs comforting.

859
01:39:21,956 --> 01:39:25,208
Don't do anything rash.

860
01:39:49,024 --> 01:39:50,984
- Floor it!
- Where's Jacques?

861
01:39:51,068 --> 01:39:53,236
I said, "Floor it!"

862
01:40:00,869 --> 01:40:02,829
Why'd he do it?

863
01:40:10,254 --> 01:40:12,797
Who knows?

864
01:40:12,881 --> 01:40:15,383
Ex-cons probably all have a screw loose.

865
01:40:38,407 --> 01:40:41,075
Want us to hold it for you?

866
01:40:53,047 --> 01:40:54,964
Where are we going now?

867
01:40:55,340 --> 01:40:56,841
No idea.

868
01:40:57,593 --> 01:40:59,594
If we don't know where we're going,

869
01:40:59,678 --> 01:41:02,638
we could stop somewhere.

870
01:41:02,723 --> 01:41:05,099
We'll get there eventually.

871
01:41:05,184 --> 01:41:08,019
- Stop to do what?
- Have sex.

872
01:41:08,103 --> 01:41:10,688
This isn't the time, sweetie.

873
01:41:12,316 --> 01:41:16,652
Only thing that counts
is getting away from that dead man.

874
01:41:16,737 --> 01:41:18,946
Please fuck me.

875
01:41:19,448 --> 01:41:21,115
I have to know...

876
01:41:22,576 --> 01:41:26,162
Don't be mean.
You know about her problem...

877
01:41:30,709 --> 01:41:35,254
OK, fine, but I'm not stopping.
Do it in the backseat.

878
01:42:20,926 --> 01:42:22,510
Come on!

879
01:42:22,594 --> 01:42:24,679
Want me to have an accident?

880
01:42:24,763 --> 01:42:26,639
Yes!

881
01:42:28,517 --> 01:42:30,143
I feel it!

882
01:42:31,228 --> 01:42:32,603
It's coming!

883
01:42:36,316 --> 01:42:38,317
I'm gonna come!

884
01:42:40,195 --> 01:42:42,947
It's gonna be big!

885
01:42:54,001 --> 01:42:55,710
Careful, it oversteers.

886
01:43:44,927 --> 01:43:46,844
What's going on?

887
01:43:46,929 --> 01:43:50,264
"What's going on?"
They stole our goddamn car!

888
01:44:06,198 --> 01:44:11,911
MURDERERS OF A MODEL WARDEN

889
01:44:19,962 --> 01:44:21,587
Get out.

890
01:44:22,506 --> 01:44:24,006
What's going on?

891
01:44:25,634 --> 01:44:27,927
This is where we part ways.

892
01:44:28,845 --> 01:44:31,514
- What'd I do?
- Nothing. That's just it.

893
01:44:31,974 --> 01:44:34,892
But we're accomplices to murder.

894
01:44:34,977 --> 01:44:40,731
We've become a burden
for a nice girl like you.

895
01:44:40,816 --> 01:44:42,024
You have to leave us...

896
01:44:42,109 --> 01:44:44,902
Just when I'm starting
to enjoy myself? No way.

897
01:44:44,987 --> 01:44:46,279
Shit!

898
01:44:46,363 --> 01:44:47,697
You're nuts.

899
01:44:50,742 --> 01:44:53,744
The thought of you
rotting in jail makes me sick.

900
01:44:53,829 --> 01:44:57,623
You're too pretty, too fragile.

901
01:44:58,458 --> 01:45:00,543
You need love and affection.

902
01:45:00,627 --> 01:45:02,712
We won't go to jail.

903
01:45:02,796 --> 01:45:06,299
You hear me?
We won't go to jail. I'm sure.

904
01:45:19,479 --> 01:45:21,230
Where's my car?

905
01:45:22,983 --> 01:45:26,360
I'd left it right here,
with the motor running...

906
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:33,784
Goddamn piece of junk!

907
01:45:43,837 --> 01:45:46,922
What a fuckin' lemon!

908
01:45:53,055 --> 01:45:57,099
Lousy stinkin' proletariat!

909
01:46:11,615 --> 01:46:13,574
We're nice guys!

910
01:46:15,952 --> 01:46:17,453
But you're mean!

911
01:46:22,501 --> 01:46:23,501
Asshole!

912
01:47:02,374 --> 01:47:04,917
Why aren't these bastards stopping?

913
01:47:07,754 --> 01:47:09,797
We'll have to steal another one.

914
01:47:16,596 --> 01:47:18,097
I feel like a Resistance fighter,

915
01:47:18,181 --> 01:47:20,933
minus the fur-lined jacket and the beret.

916
01:47:35,073 --> 01:47:37,158
What the hell is he doing?

917
01:48:20,494 --> 01:48:21,535
Comrades!

918
01:48:51,066 --> 01:48:54,818
My car fascinate you that much?

919
01:48:54,903 --> 01:48:58,739
We find it irresistible.

920
01:49:08,041 --> 01:49:09,708
The nerve!

921
01:49:09,793 --> 01:49:11,835
Do something, Henri!

922
01:49:12,921 --> 01:49:14,588
Don't mind us!

923
01:49:14,673 --> 01:49:16,882
Join us, while you're at it!

924
01:49:16,967 --> 01:49:19,093
We wouldn't want to impose.

925
01:49:19,719 --> 01:49:21,595
What do you want, then?

926
01:49:22,556 --> 01:49:24,723
A car, silly as that sounds.

927
01:49:24,808 --> 01:49:26,934
You've already got one,
so leave us alone!

928
01:49:27,018 --> 01:49:30,271
OK, fine.

929
01:49:44,869 --> 01:49:46,537
Honestly!

930
01:50:15,358 --> 01:50:19,236
Don't do anything stupid, boys...

931
01:50:20,238 --> 01:50:22,031
I believe they will.

932
01:50:22,115 --> 01:50:24,408
- Think this is funny?
- Rather.

933
01:50:24,492 --> 01:50:25,993
Jacqueline!

934
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:30,581
We'll just finish our trip
with another car.

935
01:50:30,665 --> 01:50:31,874
Jacqueline!

936
01:50:35,337 --> 01:50:38,589
- Is her name really Jacqueline?
- Got a problem with that?

937
01:50:39,424 --> 01:50:42,426
- Jacqueline...
- What's that supposed to mean?

938
01:50:42,510 --> 01:50:45,220
- The bikinis...
- "Bikinis"?

939
01:50:45,305 --> 01:50:47,306
- The scent...
- What scent?

940
01:50:47,390 --> 01:50:50,392
The scent, ma'am, the scent.

941
01:50:50,477 --> 01:50:52,603
They're out of their minds!

942
01:50:57,442 --> 01:50:59,151
And who's she?

943
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:02,237
- Hi.
- Hi.

944
01:51:02,322 --> 01:51:04,740
We just wanna trade.

945
01:51:05,784 --> 01:51:09,703
Our jalopy for your limousine.

946
01:51:09,788 --> 01:51:12,581
An old model, lots of fun.

947
01:51:12,666 --> 01:51:17,628
And it's still a Citroën,
like driving your DS's ancestor.

948
01:51:17,712 --> 01:51:19,463
It's a great deal!

949
01:51:19,547 --> 01:51:21,632
He just doesn't get it.

950
01:51:24,469 --> 01:51:26,679
I forbid you to touch my DS!

951
01:51:26,763 --> 01:51:28,305
Watch it!

952
01:51:28,932 --> 01:51:31,892
- This hurts a lot.
- Especially upside your head!

953
01:51:31,976 --> 01:51:34,645
Who cares about your DS?

954
01:51:34,729 --> 01:51:37,272
A car's a car.

955
01:51:37,816 --> 01:51:40,734
It's beautiful out, Dad.

956
01:51:40,819 --> 01:51:45,030
We're on vacation.
Tonight we're going to the seaside.

957
01:51:45,115 --> 01:51:46,782
I just got kicked out of school.

958
01:51:46,866 --> 01:51:48,492
Isn't life wonderful?

959
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:53,706
Creep!

960
01:51:54,708 --> 01:51:56,792
Loser!

961
01:51:56,876 --> 01:51:58,627
Little shit!

962
01:51:59,254 --> 01:52:00,671
Stinkin' engineer!

963
01:52:00,755 --> 01:52:04,591
Know what your only daughter says?

964
01:52:04,676 --> 01:52:08,679
I'm not going anywhere with you!

965
01:52:08,763 --> 01:52:11,724
No more volleyball, tennis and shrimp!

966
01:52:11,808 --> 01:52:13,308
I've had it!

967
01:52:14,644 --> 01:52:16,687
Please take me with you.

968
01:52:17,564 --> 01:52:20,357
We'll take their DS.
I can't be with them anymore!

969
01:52:20,442 --> 01:52:25,195
If I don't get away from 'em,
I'll just die!

970
01:52:26,281 --> 01:52:30,367
I swear I won't cramp your style!

971
01:52:30,452 --> 01:52:32,202
We can't do that.

972
01:52:32,287 --> 01:52:34,788
It's a shame, but we really can't.

973
01:52:34,873 --> 01:52:37,291
It'd be criminal to take you with us.

974
01:52:37,792 --> 01:52:40,335
You can't abandon me here!

975
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:42,880
I've burned all my bridges!

976
01:52:42,964 --> 01:52:44,715
Please take me.

977
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:47,509
OK, we'll drop you off somewhere.

978
01:52:48,928 --> 01:52:52,306
- There are 200,000 francs in Mom's purse.
- Great.

979
01:52:59,647 --> 01:53:02,065
- How old are you?
- 16.

980
01:53:03,193 --> 01:53:05,819
- Ever had sex?
- No...

981
01:53:07,739 --> 01:53:09,281
You're kidding?

982
01:53:10,241 --> 01:53:11,909
No...

983
01:53:12,452 --> 01:53:14,119
Poor dear!

984
01:53:16,623 --> 01:53:18,665
Do you realize?

985
01:53:19,250 --> 01:53:21,502
We can't let her go like that.

986
01:54:47,839 --> 01:54:49,840
Thanks for everything!

987
01:54:57,724 --> 01:54:59,224
And now?

988
01:54:59,851 --> 01:55:01,351
Where'll we go now?

989
01:55:01,436 --> 01:55:03,645
Dunno, quit bugging us.

990
01:55:03,730 --> 01:55:08,358
I'd still like to know
where we're going.

991
01:55:08,443 --> 01:55:09,776
Simple curiosity.

992
01:55:09,861 --> 01:55:13,363
He said he didn't know
and to quit bugging him.

993
01:55:13,448 --> 01:55:16,325
Quit worrying.
Everything'll work out.

994
01:55:16,743 --> 01:55:21,204
They can't put a hole in our ass.
We already got one.

995
01:55:21,289 --> 01:55:24,458
We can't just drive aimlessly,

996
01:55:24,542 --> 01:55:26,418
till we run out of gas.

997
01:55:28,463 --> 01:55:29,922
Why not?

998
01:55:31,799 --> 01:55:33,967
Aren't you happy?

999
01:55:34,427 --> 01:55:35,636
Isn't this nice?

1000
01:55:36,346 --> 01:55:37,679
Yes.

1001
01:55:37,764 --> 01:55:39,139
Peacefully.

1002
01:55:39,974 --> 01:55:41,683
In the cool of the evening.

1003
01:55:42,352 --> 01:55:44,269
Hanging loose.

01:55:45,480 --> 01:55:48,357
We can fuck anytime we want to.
