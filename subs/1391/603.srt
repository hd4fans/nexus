There was no one like Hal.

He met me at a party
and swept me off my feet.

6
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:46,147
And one more year
and I would have graduated.
一年后我本应毕业了

7
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:50,193
But I quit BU to marry him. I mean,
what was I learning at school anyway?
但我却从波士顿大学退学 嫁给了他
况且在学校能学到什么？

8
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:53,946
I mean, can you picture me
as an anthropologist?

9
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:56,991
Is that a joke?
是不是很荒谬？

10
00:01:57,201 --> 00:02:00,536
The sex was always great.
Well, he was nine years older than me.
性这方面也一直还不错
嗯 他比我大九岁

11
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:02,747
He'd already made and lost a fortune.
他那时就注定会大赚一笔钱 再失去它

I mean, much more.

God, he was dynamic.

Taught me everything I know
about real lovemaking...
真正的做爱是怎么一回事 都是他教给我的

15
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,840
...not that I care to get too graphic.
我也不想说得这么生动

16
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,260
Believe me when I tell you.
They tried six medications on me.
请相信我 他们在我身上试了六种药

Cocktails, they call them.

I never trusted doctors.

in early graves.

哈尔和我各地旅游过
我听说过旧金山的美

She's divorced.
我将要和妹妹 金吉 住在一起
她离婚了

Biologically, she's not my sister.
She's adopted. We're both adopted.
血统上说她不是我妹妹
她是领养的 我们都是被领养的

25
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,868

He used to hit her.
我受不了她的前夫
他总是打她

到西边去 最开始是不是霍勒斯·格里利说的这句话？

30

It was really nice talking to you.
噢 我家人来了

She was talking to herself.
她在自言自语

about her life.

where I can't take a deep breath...
我没事，就是在有些地方没办法深呼吸……

45
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:17,882

and it makes it even worse.
可以深呼吸的时候我又会紧张 就更难受

壁炉是真的能生火的
我可不喜欢只是摆设的壁炉

and the ceilings are so high.
又明亮又宽敞

with the less fortunate.

-Hey.
-Hey.
-嗨

-周日下午你参加过一个派对吗？

I got a friend who's a bartender.
He saw you at a party.
我有个朋友是酒吧侍者

I was nervous about going to a party
where I didn't know anyone.
我如果在派对上谁也不认识我就紧张

Is that so? So the two of you
were in the corner...

-Give me a break.
-亲来亲去
-等等

1096
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:42,656
We couldn't go to the ballpark
because you weren't feeling good.
周日你说你不舒服所以不能和我去看球赛

1097
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:46,285
Hey, don't treat me like property.
I had a headache when you called.
别拿我当你私人财产似的
你打电话的时候我的确头痛

to keep my sister company at a party.

from you?

Can you please not fight in here?
能不能别在这里吵？

1102
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:59,173
I don't think I can take it. For some
reason, my Xanax isn't kicking in.
我受不了
吃了阿普挫仑也没效果

1103
01:01:59,383 --> 01:02:01,550
Who's this guy
you're fooling around with?
到底那个男人是谁？

01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:05,012
I told you, I didn't like you rushing me
into anything, okay?
告诉你 我不喜欢你这样忽然跑来质问我

-No, it's my idea.
-和其他男人接触是她的主意吗?
-不 是我的主意

1106
01:02:08,016 --> 01:02:11,852
I don't think it is. She thinks I'm a bum
like your first husband, right?
我不信 她一直觉得我和你前夫一样是个混混 不是吗

1107
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:13,938
-You told me.
-Guys, give me a break.
-你来告诉我
-休息下好吗

-What do you mean?
-不管怎么说 我才应该住在这儿

for the kids?
难道你不希望有个男人在这里帮你照顾孩子吗？

1110
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:22,613

-I need to clear my head.
-这样他们成长的时候也能有个爸爸？
-让我冷静一下

1111
01:02:22,823 --> 01:02:26,575
We're talking about getting married.
Now she's taking you to parties...
我们都打算要结婚了
她却带你去乱七八糟的派对

1112
01:02:26,785 --> 01:02:29,245

I'm not good enough for you.

It's got nothing to do with you.
你滚开！
跟你一点关系没有

you can count on. I am.
金吉 你根本不能相信她
我才是你可以信任的人

1118

Don't pick it up. I don't want him to think
I'm waiting for him to call.
别这么快接 我不想让他知道我在等他打电话

not how she feels about you.
我的感觉才算数

calling you a loser...

everything for?

and never contact me?
为什么就那样一走了之 也不和我联系？

What does that stupidity even mean?
这是什么意思？
这是什么蠢事？

1481

for the future together.
