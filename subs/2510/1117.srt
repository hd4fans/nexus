你有一条毒舌  知道吗

真希望我们有豆奶

认真的吗
Seriously?

00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,470
是认真的

54
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,770
你喝过吗
Have you ever tried it?

55
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:04,130
我三年级时的最好朋友
My best friend in third grade,

56
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,210
他对牛奶过敏
he was allergic to dairy.

57
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:09,570
他每天吃午餐时都会带上豆奶

58
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,190
-我喝过  -然后呢
- I tried it. - And?

59
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,590
-我吐了  -别说瞎话
- I threw up. - Oh, yeah, right.

60
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,190
好吧  好吧  我差点吐了
All right, all right. I almost threw up.

61
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,790
但我觉得很恶心
But I was like, ugh.

62
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,100
恶心死了
It was so gross.

63
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,500
我说真的  我宁愿喝奶粉
I mean, literally, I would rather have powdered milk

64
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,440
也不愿意再喝那种东西了
than to have to drink that stuff again.

65
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,800
我宁愿喝朱迪思的婴儿奶粉

66
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,160

谢谢你
Thank you.

69
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,790
我听到他在里面笑
I heard him laughing in there.

70
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,630
我都快忘了他的笑声是什么样了
Almost forgot what that sounded like.

71
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,090
我不能同时当他的父亲和最好的朋友
I can't be his father and his best friend.

72
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,760
他需要你
He needs you.

73
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,080
我知道你一下子很难接受
I know that's a lot to throw at you.

74
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,070
所以如果你需要休息一下
So if you're ever feeling like you need a break...

75
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,450
我不想再休息了
I'm done taking breaks.

76
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,930
你有什么计划
So what's the plan?

这里
This place,

是家
is it home

79
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,380
还是暂时的避风港
or just a stop along the way?

80
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,750
好吧  我们
Well, let's--

81
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,410
搞明白之前我们就待在这里吧
let's just stay here while we figure it out.

82
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,470
我们需要更多的补给品

你昨天还昏迷不醒
You were unconscious yesterday.

86
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,230
-今天醒了  -我们需要你恢复体力

87
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,460
休息一下
Just rest.

88
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,170
再休息一天
Just one more day.

89
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,310
你觉得你们会去多久

装满几个袋子  不会太久

00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,360
还是密封的呢
Found it still sealed and everything.

106
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,620
我做个好人  让你吃第一口
Now I'll be nice and let you have the first pull.

107
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,600
不了  谢谢
No, thanks.

108
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,640
真的
Are you sure?

109
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,930
我没事
I'm fine.

110
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,650
你看起来不像没事
You don't seem fine.

111
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,550
我只是累了
I'm just tired.

112
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,500
好吗
Okay?

113
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,570
对不起
I'm sorry.

114
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,980
我不太擅长逗你这个年龄的男孩笑
I'm not very good at making boys your age laugh.

115
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,940
我笑了
I was laughing.

116
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,520
在心里笑
Inside.

117
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,830
小宝宝觉得我很逗
Toddlers find me funny.

118
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,850
两三岁的
Two, three-year-olds.

119
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,810
小宝宝是什么意思
What do you mean toddlers?

120
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,520
我有过一个三岁的儿子
I had a three-year-old son

121
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,100
而他觉得我超级搞笑
and he happened to find me extremely funny.

122
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,760
我们需要食物  电池  水
We need food, batteries, water,

123
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,070
按这个顺序分紧要次要
in that order.

124
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,050
为什么你从没告诉过我你有过孩子
Why didn't you ever tell me you had a kid?

125
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,790
他叫什么
What was his name?

126
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,290
你有其他孩子吗
Did you have any others?

127
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,580
你结过婚吗
Were you married?

128
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,310
好吧
Okay.

129
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,530
我每次只回答一个问题
I'll answer one question at a time,

130
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,940
每进一个房间回答一次
one room at a time,

131
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,770
而且必须在我们确认屋内安全之后
and only after we've cleared it.

132
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:21,450
-不要  对不起  -你是个撒谎的懦夫
- No, I'm sorry. - You're a lying coward.

133
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,540
你就只能是这样的人了
That's all you'll ever be.

134
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,120
不要  拜托了  我很抱歉
No, please, I'm sorry.

135
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,680
别这么做  求你了
Don't do this, please.

136
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,400
你他妈对我说什么了
What the hell'd you say to me?

137
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:30,230
-我说别这么做  -这不关你的事
- I said don't do this. - This ain't your business.

138
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,820
-我很抱歉  伙计  -你闭嘴吧
- I'm sorry, man. -Aw, shut up.

139
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,220
我真的很抱歉  不  不要
I'm so sorry. No, don't.

140
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,120
我不会停手的
It's gonna happen.

141
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,470
我们能解决这个的  拜托了
We can work this out. Please,

142
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,230
-别这么做  -我不会停手的
- Don't do this. - It's gonna happen.

143
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,510
不  不  不要  拜托了
No, no, no, please.

144
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,030
拜托不要  求你了
Please don't. Please!

145
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,420
-你什么时候搞定啊  -是啊
- You plan on finishing the job? - Yeah.

146
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,020
我耳朵都要聋了
I'm getting an earache

147
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,230
我就知道他会叫个不停
and I know he's just gonna let his ass squeal.

148
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,850
就凭他做过的事  这男的活该流血
After what he did, the man deserves to bleed.

149
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,580
你们想的话就都留在下面
Y'all stay down there if you want.

150
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,680
我们今晚就住这儿了
This will be our abode for the evening.

151
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,420
把你的烂摊子收拾干净  哈利
Clean up your mess, Harley.

152
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,460
你儿子叫什么
What was your son's name?

153
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,900
我说了检查后再说
I said after.

154
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:15,650
这其实是两间分开的房间
Well, these are actually two separate rooms

155
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,460
而我们已经检查了那间  所以
and we already cleared that one, so...

156
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,090
安德烈
Andre.

157
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,970
他叫安德烈・安东尼
His name was Andre Anthony.

158
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,590
你去看看那儿有没有藏着饼干什么的
Make sure there isn't a box of cookies hiding in there.

159
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,320
你还有其他孩子吗
Did you have any other kids?

160
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,690
朋友  注意游戏规则
Rules of the game, my friend.

161
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,330
所以呢
So?

162
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,190
你有吗
Did you?

163
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,660
你知道吗  你真适合当间谍
You know, you could be a spy.

164
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,660
或者是警察
Or a cop.

165
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,820
没有
No.

166
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,450
一个孩子对我而言就够了
One was enough for me.

167
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,390
安德烈就是个小麻烦  像你一样
And Andre was a handful, like you.

168
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,520
这个走廊算一个房间吗
Does this hallway count as a room?

169
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,690
假如你能在这里找到我们需要的就算
If you can find something we can use.

170
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,800
我只找到这个
This is the only thing I could find.

171
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,170
这算吗
Does it count?

172
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,400
理论上算
Technically, yes.

173
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,320
那么
So?

174
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,480
多久了
How long has it been?

175
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,690
那事发生在...
It happened after--

176
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,930
发生在灾变之后
you know, after everything happened.

177
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,280
我爸爸知道吗
Does my dad know?

178
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,270
我从没告诉过他
Never told him.

179
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,800
在刚刚告诉你之前
Never told anyone

180
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,750
我从没告诉过任何人
till just now.

181
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,690
我会为你保密
Your secret is safe with me.

182
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,740
其实也不算什么秘密
It's not really a secret.

183
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,470
我还是会保密
It's still safe with me.

184
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:37,370
米琼恩
Michonne?

185
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,760
没事吧
Everything okay?

186
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,490
没事
Yeah, it's fine.

187
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,550
那里有孩子吗
There's a baby in there.

188
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,450
是条狗
It's a dog.

189
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,030
我爸让我给她取名字
My dad let me name her.

190
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,590
也许
Maybe--

191
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:26,530
也许她跟安德烈待在同一个地方
maybe her and Andre are together somewhere.

192
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:38,620
走吧
Come on.

193
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,190
已经快中午了
It's almost noon.

194
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,190
我们要是晚了  你爸爸会担心的
Your dad will wonder where we are if we're late.

195
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,910
喂
Yo.

196
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,380
舒服吗
Comfy?

197
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,730
你把我弄醒就为了问我舒不舒服吗
You waking me up to see if I'm comfortable?

198
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,870
我想躺会儿
I want to lie down.

199
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:16,330
这层还有两个卧室呢
Two other bedrooms up here to choose.

200
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,990
那是小孩的床
Them's kids' beds.

201
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,520
我要这张
I want this one.

202
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,630
-已经被我占了  -我可不管
- It's claimed. - I didn't hear it.

203
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,410
你换个地方去占吧
You gonna have to lay claim somewhere else.

204
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:49,750
伦
Len!

205
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:51,990
伦  住手
Len, stop!

206
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,080
伦  住手
Stop, Len!

207
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,460
-住手  -休想
- Stop! - Hell, no.

208
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:01,870
住手
Stop!

209
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,940
床归我了  混蛋
My bed now, jackoff.

210
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,880
别动
Hey, don't move.

211
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,680
喝点水
Here's some water.

212
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,710
我们在哪儿
Where are we?

213
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:17,350
我不知道
I don't know.

214
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,810
一离开监狱我们就跟行尸干上了
We were fighting biters and you passed out

215
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:21,390
然后你晕倒了
right after we left the prison.

216
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:22,100
我不知道怎么办
I didn't know what to do.

217
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,720
坐在卡车后面似乎比走路更安全
The back of the truck seemed safer than the side of the road.

218
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:31,050
有经过一辆大巴吗
Did we pass a bus?

219
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,270
路上有经过一辆大巴吗
On the road, did we pass a bus?

220
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,830
有
Yeah.

221
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:37,910
你看到什么了
What did you see?

222
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,750
你看到什么了
What did you see?

223
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:46,930
他们都死了
They were all dead.

224
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,670
我们路过多久了
How long since we passed it?

225
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,600
三小时
Three hours.

226
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,760
快停车
Hey, stop the truck.

227
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:08,190
该死的  快停车
Hey, numbnuts, stop the truck.

228
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,550
快停车
Stop the truck!

229
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,920
快停车
Stop the truck!

230
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,220
你要去哪儿
Where the hell are you going?

231
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,940
他要去哪儿
Where the hell is he going?

232
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,090
我不知道你的女伙伴有没有告诉你
I don't know what your lady friend's told you

233
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,650
我们这次任务的特殊性
about the special nature of the mission we're on,

234
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,150
但我们赶时间
but this shit is time-sensitive

235
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,800
已经比计划晚了
and we're already way behind schedule.

236
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,390
所以你马上转身给我回车上去
So I need you to turn your ass around and get back in the truck.

237
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,390
-我必须得走  -你们俩好像
- I gotta go. - It seems like neither one of you's

238
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,720
完全不了解
been paying close enough attention

239
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,550
我们现在的糟糕处境
to the hell on earth we've been living in.

240
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,970
那我就告诉你怎么才能避免
So let me tell you how to best avoid

241
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,230
变成那种行尸走肉
winding up just another dead-alive prick.

242
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,530
找个强大而且志同道合的伙伴
You find some strong, like-minded comrades

243
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:03,320
然后不论发生什么  都待在一起
and you stay stuck together like wet on water.

244
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,310
我们需要人
We need people.

245
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:09,240
多多益善  我们相互依赖  伙计
The more the better. We need each other, partner.

246
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,410
即便有这么多装备  你也不可能撑过一晚
Even with all that gear on your shoulder, you won't last a night.

247
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,870
你自己肯定不行
Not by yourself.

248
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,980
我愿意冒险
I'll take my chances.

249
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,760
我必须坚持
I'm gonna have to insist

250
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,000
让你留下
that you hold the hell up.

251
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,180
不管你信不信
All right, believe it or not,

252
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:26,140
全人类的命运也许就取决于此了
the fate of the entire damn human race might depend on it.

253
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:32,680
你在说什么
What the hell are you talking about?

254
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,150
这家伙是谁
Who is this guy?

255
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,470
我是亚伯拉罕・福特中士
I'm Sergeant Abraham Ford.

256
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,170
他们是我的同伴
And these are my companions

257
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,810
罗西塔・埃斯皮诺萨和尤金・伯特博士
Rosita Espinosa and Dr. Eugene Porter.

258
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,630
我们的任务是把尤金送到华府
We're on a mission to get Eugene to Washington, DC.

259
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:48,020
尤金是科学家
Eugene's a scientist

260
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,360
他知道行尸遍地的真正原因
and he knows exactly what caused this mess.

261
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,460
好吧
All right.

262
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:03,880
怎么回事
So what happened?

263
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,410
这是机密
It's classified.

264
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,710
他一直在用他的卫星电话
He'd been talking to the muckety-mucks in Washington

265
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,240
和华盛顿高层保持联系
on his satellite phone.

266
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,120
过去的几个星期里
The past couple weeks,

267
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:18,090
没有人接电话了
nobody's been picking up on the other end.

268
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:20,560
我们看到了你之前是如何对付行尸的
We saw how you handled those corpses back there.

269
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,700
我们需要你的帮助
We could use your help.

270
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,290
抱歉
Sorry.

271
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,090
之前咱俩得离开那条路
I had to get us off that road.

272
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,720
你晕过去了  我们也没有子弹了
You were passed out, we were out of bullets.

273
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,180
但是我知道怎么回到大巴那里
But I know how to get back to that bus.

274
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,570
我把每个转弯都记下来了
I wrote down every turn.

275
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,570
我会把你带回去的  我可以的  好吗
I will get you back, I can, okay?

276
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,290
她会去那找我
That's where she'd go to find me.

277
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,620
-我要去那  -那是浪费时间
- That's where I'm gonna go. - It's a waste of time.

278
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,060
塔拉告诉了我发生了什么
Tara told us what went down.

279
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:04,880
你找到你妻子的可能性为零
There is zero chance you will ever find your wife again.

280
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,410
不管是死是活
Alive or dead.

281
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,970
因为  抱歉这样说 
Mainly because, sorry to tell you,

282
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:10,590
她没了
she's gone.

283
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:16,360
你没必要也去送死
No need for you to die, too.

284
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,130
走吧
Now come on.

285
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:22,600
回车上去  做点有意义的事
Get back in the truck. Do something with your life.

286
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,790
当我们...
When the people we...

287
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,150
爱的人死...
we love kick...

288
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,370
当他们消失了
well, they disappear.

289
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,920
不意味着你也要那样做
Doesn't mean you've got to go out that way, too.

290
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,790
她还活着  我会找到她的
She's alive and I'm gonna find her.

291
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,900
狗娘养的
You son of a bitch!

292
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:06,250
-嘿  -亚伯拉罕
- Hey, hey, hey! - Abraham!

293
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,390
放开他
Hey, get off him.

294
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,460
住手
Come on.

295
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,290
别这样  亚伯拉罕
You don't want this, Abraham.

296
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,560
放开我
Let me go!

297
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:20,680
-亚伯拉罕  -住手
- Abraham! - Stop!

298
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,430
-住手  -亚伯拉罕
- Hey! - Abraham!

299
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,650
快住手
Hey, get--

300
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:44,390
别打了  过来
Hey, hey, hey! Come here!

301
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,440
住手
Stop!

302
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,140
尤金
Eugene!

303
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:09,880
别开枪  该死
Stop firing, damn it!

304
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,350
别开枪了  我们得去拿武器
Stop firing! We need to get our weapons.

305
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,990
别管他了
Leave 'em!

306
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,440
给我支枪
Hey, give me a gun.

307
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,860
给我支枪
Give me a gun.

308
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,430
该死的
Son of a dick.

309
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:04,210
托尼  伦  滚下来
Tony, Len, get your asses down here.

310
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,820
听见没有
Yo, you hear me?

311
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,570
克莱姆  克莱姆  克莱姆
Claim, Claim, Claim!

312
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:12,960
闭上臭嘴  我要睡觉
Shut the hell up. I'm trying to sleep.

313
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,800
有个女的住在这
There's a woman shacking up in here.

314
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,820
-什么  -你下来看看
- Say what? - Come on down.

315
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:20,530
-漂亮吗  -现在先别撸
- She hot? - Don't grab your pecker just yet.

316
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:21,660
她没在这
She ain't here.

317
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,370
你们瞎嚷嚷什么呢
What the hell you hollering about?

318
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,680
找到了她的衬衫
Found her shirt.

319
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:30,140
肯定是今天早上才洗的
Must have washed it this morning.

320
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,210
-好香啊  -你们找到了衬衫
- Smells good. - Oh, you found a shirt?

321
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:35,180
她搞不好已经离开很久了
She could be miles away by now.

322
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,290
那她就没必要费力气
Why'd she go to all the trouble of washing a shirt

323
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,060
洗一件要扔的衬衫了
when she's just gonna ditch it?

324
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,140
-她会回来的  -她回来之后  我要第一个上
- She'll be back. - I call first when she gets here.

325
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,020
谁知道她有没有其他同伴呢
Who knows who else she got with her.

326
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,720
我们得做好万全准备
We need to be ready for anything.

327
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,970
-伦  你去侧面房间  -等一下  我去拿枪
- Len, take the side room. - Hold on, let me get a gun.

328
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:50,980
我会盯着前厅  你负责另一侧的房间
I'll watch the front den, you've got the other side room.

329
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,580
-我以为托尼负责呢  -托尼跑哪去了
- I thought Tony got that. - Where the hell is Tony?

330
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:54,710
托尼
Tony!

331
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,360
把他叫起来
Get him the hell up.

332
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:06,690
我们当时开着这种车进行护送
We were running a convoy in one of these.

333
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,820
开上一个沙丘  有个骆驼站在那
Coming up a dune, there's this camel,

334
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,460
看起来像是要吐
looks like it's about to puke.

335
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:13,590
可能是因为哪个混蛋给它屁股上
Probably because shitbird's packed

336
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:15,970
装了大概1.8公斤的C-4炸弹
about four pounds of C-4 up its ass.

337
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,250
我们距离爆炸点也就六米左右
We were within 20 feet of that blast

338
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:21,120
炸得骆驼的驼峰飞出了半公里
that sent that animal's hump half a klick into the desert.

339
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,280
然后我们还能开车回去
And we drove home.

340
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:27,180
所以你跟我说说你到底做了什么
So you tell me how in the holy hell

341
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:30,390
才让这卡车抛锚
did you possibly kill this truck?

342
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:33,620
高度兴奋的状态
A fully amped-up state

343
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,790
和对速射武器的无知
and an ignorance of rapid-firing weapons.

344
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,260
这是你的吗
Is this yours?

345
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,350
很遗憾你们的车坏了
Sorry about your ride.

346
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,760
希望你们能到达华府
Hope you guys make it to Washington.

347
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,100
等等我
Wait for me.

348
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,950
我们他妈的还能干什么
What the hell else are we gonna do?

349
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,380
去华府啊
Go to Washington.

350
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,430
拯救世界啊
Fix the whole damn world!

351
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:28,090
那条路安全  北边就难说了
That way's clear. Who knows what's north.

352
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,220
我们先跟着他们  找到车后再离开
We'll find another vehicle. We'll go with them until we do.

353
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:35,160
相信我  我比你聪明
Trust me. I'm smarter than you.

354
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,700
拜托
Come on.

355
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:26,090
-挡住它  -奶奶的
- Stop her! - Son of bitch.

356
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:26,950
杀了它  杀了它
Kill her! Kill her!

357
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,670
走  走
Go! Go!

358
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,900
不得不说
Got to hand it to him.

359
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:55,050
这家伙真坚决
He's a persistent son of a bitch.

360
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:59,260
我知道你为什么跟随他了
I get why you're following him.

361
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,020
你很忠心
You're loyal.

362
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,130
你是个好人
You're a good person.

363
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,810
我喜欢
I like it.

364
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,720
但我们要做的事
But what we're doing--

365
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:13,530
我不知道该怎么说
I don't know how else to say it--

366
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:17,020
拯救世界
saving the world is just--

367
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,190
更为重要
is just more important.

368
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,990
就算他找到妻子
I mean, even if he does find his wife,

369
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,870
那又怎样
so what?

370
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:31,720
如果我们不把尤金送到华府
How long do you think they'll live happily ever after

371
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,970
你觉得他们能安稳生活多久
if we don't get Eugene up to Washington?

372
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:35,970
你以为我跟着格伦
You think because I'm following Glenn,

373
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:37,410
就说明我是个好人吗
that makes me a good person?

374
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,990
我不是好人
I'm not.

375
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,340
你是好人
You're good.

376
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,930
你根本不了解我
You don't know anything about me.

377
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:49,560
正如我也不了解你为什么要去华府
Just like I don't know anything about why you're going to Washington.

378
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:52,220
我知道尤金为什么去
I get why Eugene's going.

379
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,870
他是唯一一个知道如何终结这一切的人
He's the only one that knows how to end this.

380
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:56,920
而罗西塔是因为爱你  她会永远伴你左右
And Rosita, she loves you. She'd follow you anywhere.

381
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:59,070
但你为什么同意
But why the hell you agreed

382
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,840
带他穿越大半个国家...
to drive him halfway across the country...

383
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,020
我想拯救世界就这么难相信吗
Is that hard to believe, I want to save the world?

384
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,950
仅仅因为你是个好人吗
Because you're a good person?

385
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,680
你不用告诉我真正原因
You don't have to tell me why.

386
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:10,720
但也别骗我
Just don't lie to me.

387
