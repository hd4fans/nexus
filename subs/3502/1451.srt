00:01:08,283 --> 00:01:13,243
NARRATOR: Only time can teach us
what is truth and what is legend.

4
00:01:14,289 --> 00:01:17,520
Some truths do not survive the ages.

5
00:01:17,693 --> 00:01:21,686
But the legend of the child
with the blue eyes will live forever...

6
00:01:21,864 --> 00:01:26,324
...and be whispered in all four winds
of the Great White Mountains.

7
00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:32,204
We, the Yagahl, were hunters
of the mightiest of all beasts...

8
00:01:32,374 --> 00:01:34,001
...the Mannak.

9
00:01:34,376 --> 00:01:36,401
But our world began to change.

10
00:01:37,045 --> 00:01:40,105
The Mannaks came later and later
to our valley...

11
00:01:40,315 --> 00:01:43,807
...and there were times
when they did not come at all.

12
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:46,044
Our hunters grew restless.

13
00:01:46,221 --> 00:01:49,281
And our people grew hungry.

14
00:01:52,895 --> 00:01:54,726
Only one amongst us...

15
00:01:54,897 --> 00:01:59,129
...the one we call "Old Mother,"
the last of her kind...

16
00:01:59,334 --> 00:02:02,735
...only she could speak
to the spirits of the earth...

17
00:02:02,905 --> 00:02:06,397
...and ask the wisdom of the Fathers
to save our people.

18
00:02:12,447 --> 00:02:15,109
Many times she asks...

19
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:21,118
...until one night they answered her call
and sent us a sign.

20
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:28,593
A sign of the beginning of the end.

21
00:02:28,764 --> 00:02:32,860
HUNTER: We found her in the mountains.
She was holding on to a dead woman.

22
00:03:02,397 --> 00:03:03,955
The Fathers have sent her.

23
00:03:25,287 --> 00:03:30,816
She came to tell us
of four-legged demons...

24
00:03:30,993 --> 00:03:34,485
...that will put an end to our world.

25
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:41,400
They will come to our valley
at the time when...

26
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:45,235
...we go on our last hunt.

27
00:03:46,308 --> 00:03:49,539
But do not fear.

28
00:03:50,545 --> 00:03:55,209
From this hunt a warrior will arise...

29
00:03:55,384 --> 00:03:59,980
...and this one will be his woman.

30
00:04:00,155 --> 00:04:03,454
They will lead us into a new life...

31
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:08,790
...where the Yagahl
will know hunger no more.

32
00:04:12,968 --> 00:04:14,230
That night...

33
00:04:14,403 --> 00:04:18,396
...Old Mother did not see the face
of the warrior of which she spoke...

34
00:04:18,573 --> 00:04:21,041
...but she knew that the child
with the blue eyes...

35
00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:24,669
...was a blessing she must protect.

36
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,041
To our people, she was Evolet...

37
00:04:29,217 --> 00:04:31,685
...the promise of life.

38
00:04:31,853 --> 00:04:36,290
To a boy named D'Leh,
she was much more than that.

39
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,067
Only one of the Yagahl did not believe in
Old Mother's prophecy:

40
00:04:56,244 --> 00:04:58,940
The young boy's father...

41
00:04:59,114 --> 00:05:03,414
...the one who carried the White Spear
and blew the whistle for the hunt.

42
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,114
I will watch over your son
as if he were my own.

43
00:05:10,225 --> 00:05:14,423
I know you will. But promise me
you will tell no one why I left.

44
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:24,105
We cannot wait for the last hunt.

45
00:05:37,285 --> 00:05:40,118
- Good throw! Throw again!
- Good throw!

46
00:05:40,288 --> 00:05:41,915
Ka'ren?

47
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,258
Ka'ren? Hmm?

48
00:05:44,993 --> 00:05:46,756
No. Not you.

49
00:05:47,963 --> 00:05:51,091
Your father abandoned our people.
Go away.

50
00:05:52,034 --> 00:05:53,626
Fight well!

51
00:05:53,802 --> 00:05:55,702
You must win, Ka'ren!

52
00:05:56,271 --> 00:05:57,636
TIC'TIC:
Leave him!

53
00:05:57,806 --> 00:05:59,603
Ka'ren! I said leave him!

54
00:06:03,945 --> 00:06:05,105
D'Leh.

55
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,111
He is the son of a coward.

56
00:06:07,282 --> 00:06:08,806
You never say that again.

57
00:06:10,485 --> 00:06:12,248
Any of you.

58
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,858
BO Y:
Good throw.

59
00:06:29,905 --> 00:06:31,372
You are alone...

60
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,671
...like me.

61
00:06:38,246 --> 00:06:39,975
What happened to your people?

62
00:06:40,882 --> 00:06:42,816
They were killed...

63
00:06:43,318 --> 00:06:45,309
...by four-legged demons.

64
00:06:57,365 --> 00:07:00,095
You will never be alone, Evolet.

65
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:07,906
Do you see that light?

66
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,637
That one?

67
00:07:10,812 --> 00:07:14,748
It does not move across the sky
like all the others do.

68
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,517
That light is like you in my heart.

69
00:07:19,087 --> 00:07:21,351
It will never go away.

70
00:07:21,523 --> 00:07:23,457
It will never go away?

71
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,684
No, never.

72
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:30,789
OLD MOTHER:
Evolet, come here.

73
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,058
Don't stray from the hut
without telling me.

74
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,973
And for many moons...

75
00:07:40,575 --> 00:07:44,067
...Evolet and D'Leh
looked at each other...

76
00:07:44,246 --> 00:07:47,579
...and the love in their hearts
grew stronger.

77
00:07:56,591 --> 00:07:59,890
Until finally, after many years...

78
00:08:01,196 --> 00:08:05,792
...the day of the last hunt arrived.

79
00:08:07,068 --> 00:08:09,901
BAKU: D'Leh, how long do we
have to keep watch?

80
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:12,005
Until the Mannaks come.

81
00:08:13,508 --> 00:08:15,738
And when will they come?

82
00:08:15,911 --> 00:08:17,640
Do not know.

83
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,706
D'Leh, when will I become a hunter?

84
00:08:19,881 --> 00:08:22,349
When you stop asking
so many questions.

85
00:08:29,024 --> 00:08:32,687
The Great Hunter Tic'Tic
came to Old Mother's hut today.

86
00:08:32,861 --> 00:08:35,523
She thinks the time of prophecy
has come.

87
00:08:35,697 --> 00:08:38,325
She told him not to kill
the Mannak this hunt.

88
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,903
She thinks Ka'ren will win the White Spear
and claim Evolet.

89
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:50,142
- Baku, look what I found for you.
- Ah.

90
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:52,737
Mm.

91
00:08:53,348 --> 00:08:55,646
You know what a good hunter Ka'ren is.

92
00:08:55,817 --> 00:08:59,184
We must run away. Together,
we can cross the Great Mountains.

93
00:08:59,354 --> 00:09:03,120
And abandon our people? Like my father?

94
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,449
I cannot do that.

95
00:09:07,495 --> 00:09:10,362
I worked on this for many moons.

96
00:09:13,034 --> 00:09:18,472
The only way we can be together
is I must kill the Mannak.

97
00:09:29,884 --> 00:09:32,819
They are here! They are here! Look!

98
00:09:37,225 --> 00:09:39,090
Look how many there are.

99
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,782
Today...

100
00:10:11,192 --> 00:10:16,425
...I will not pierce the heart of the Mannak.
It will be one of you.

101
00:10:16,598 --> 00:10:19,431
One of you will claim the White Spear.

102
00:10:19,601 --> 00:10:21,296
May the Fathers of the Yagahl...

103
00:10:21,469 --> 00:10:26,270
...and the spirit of the mighty Mannak
choose the best of you.

104
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:30,143
MOHA:
Ka'ren, you have the first throw.

105
00:10:30,312 --> 00:10:33,577
LU'KIBU: Ka'ren, the Mannak is yours.
You will be our leader.

106
00:10:37,752 --> 00:10:40,721
D'Leh? What about you?

107
00:10:42,223 --> 00:10:45,192
I hunt to win Evolet.

108
00:10:46,961 --> 00:10:50,260
We hunt together as one!

109
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,396
HUNTER:
Tic'Tic found the lead bull.

110
00:12:20,488 --> 00:12:21,887
TIC'TIC:
Slow down!

111
00:12:23,057 --> 00:12:24,854
D'Leh!

112
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,933
They're breaking away! Bring them back!

113
00:12:59,027 --> 00:13:02,554
Baku! They're coming!
They're coming, Baku!

114
00:13:03,264 --> 00:13:06,495
They're coming! They're coming!

115
00:13:20,748 --> 00:13:23,945
The last one is coming! It is a big bull!

116
00:13:25,553 --> 00:13:27,111
HUNTER:
Now!

117
00:13:49,077 --> 00:13:52,444
MOHA: D'Leh is coming!
Ka'ren, make your throw!

118
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:03,248
Keep him down! Hold the net!

119
00:14:16,471 --> 00:14:18,598
He is too strong! Let go, Ka'ren!

120
00:14:19,607 --> 00:14:21,541
D'Leh, we have to let go!

121
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:23,939
I can't! My hand is caught!

122
00:15:58,573 --> 00:15:59,631
LU'KIBU:
Look! Look!

123
00:16:00,174 --> 00:16:01,198
It's D'Leh!

124
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,415
BAKU:
You killed him! All alone!

125
00:16:11,586 --> 00:16:13,486
No one has ever done that.

126
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,923
That was brave.

127
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,892
D'Leh killed the Mannak!
He did not let go of the net!

128
00:16:25,066 --> 00:16:27,057
He was the only one!

129
00:16:30,505 --> 00:16:32,666
What are you waiting for?

130
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:36,668
Wise Spirit, I killed the Mannak.

131
00:16:37,145 --> 00:16:40,672
I claim the White Spear...

132
00:16:41,015 --> 00:16:42,949
...and with it my woman...

133
00:16:43,818 --> 00:16:45,513
...Evolet.

134
00:16:55,496 --> 00:17:00,900
From that day on, D'Leh was no longer
the son of a coward.

135
00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:04,095
Now the Yagahl would honor his name...

136
00:17:04,272 --> 00:17:10,040
...for bringing to them the blessings
of the Mannak for one last time.

137
00:17:10,511 --> 00:17:16,507
And though Old Mother was pleased
in her heart to see Evolet so happy...

138
00:17:16,951 --> 00:17:19,215
...she feared in her soul...

139
00:17:19,387 --> 00:17:22,686
...that the one who had slayed
the mighty beast...

140
00:17:22,857 --> 00:17:26,987
...did not have the courage
for what was to come.

141
00:17:39,674 --> 00:17:42,575
Why does Tic'Tic not celebrate with us?

142
00:17:47,682 --> 00:17:50,674
- D'Leh?
- There is something I must do.

143
00:18:06,901 --> 00:18:08,766
What do you want?

144
00:18:14,175 --> 00:18:15,733
I was not brave.

145
00:18:16,344 --> 00:18:18,938
And I did not hunt as one.

146
00:18:20,181 --> 00:18:23,844
The Fathers of the Yagahl
played with us today.

147
00:18:24,018 --> 00:18:25,246
What should I do?

148
00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:28,411
If I give up the White Spear,
I give up Evolet. I cannot do that.

149
00:18:28,856 --> 00:18:31,290
Is she yours to give up?

150
00:18:31,526 --> 00:18:32,993
Hmm?

151
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:39,798
It is not the way of the Yagahl
to claim the White Spear with a lie.

152
00:19:02,423 --> 00:19:04,823
I gave the White Spear back to Tic'Tic.

153
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,785
Why would you do such a thing?

154
00:19:07,995 --> 00:19:10,964
Because I did not kill the Mannak, Evolet.

155
00:19:11,132 --> 00:19:14,624
- Of course you did, you held on to the net.
- No, I lied.

156
00:19:18,072 --> 00:19:23,442
I tried to let go like all the others.
My hand was caught in it.

157
00:19:24,478 --> 00:19:28,073
After that, the Mannak ran into my spear.

158
00:19:28,883 --> 00:19:30,316
I did nothing.

159
00:19:34,121 --> 00:19:38,990
Evolet, remember what I told you
about our light?

160
00:19:40,127 --> 00:19:42,595
I still feel the same.
