1
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,900
根据真实事件改编

2
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:23,114
托马斯勋爵
Lord Thomas.

3
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:27,150
亨利勋爵
Lord Henry.

4
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,116
安布罗斯勋爵
Lord Ambrose.

5
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:33,924
罗伯特勋爵
Lord Robert.

6
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,828
沃尔特勋爵
Lord Walter.

7
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,700
你最好别让我失望，查尔斯・格雷
You'd better not let me down, Charles Grey.

8
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:47,933
- 我在你身上押了20畿尼 - 只有20？如果换成我押，我就押40
- I've got 20 guineas riding on you. - Only 20? I'd double that if I were you.

9
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:53,337
走，女士们
Come on, ladies.

10
00:01:54,745 --> 00:01:57,337
英格兰 阿尔索普庄园 1774年4月

11
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:02,282
先生们，绕着跑两圈，听我口令
Gentlemen, twice around the course, on my count.

12
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,753
三，二…
Three, two,

13
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:10,291
一！
one!

14
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:11,921
- 跑啊，格雷先生！ - 跑啊，托马斯！
- Come on, Mr. Grey! - Come on, Thomas!

15
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:15,001
- 跑啊，格雷先生！ - 跑啊，沃尔特勋爵！
- Come on, Mr. Grey! - Run, Lord Walter!

16
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,366
跑啊，格雷先生！
Come on, Mr. Grey!

17
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,132
跑啊，格雷先生，别慢吞吞的
Come on, Mr. Grey. You're tired already.

18
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,800
- 跑啊，格雷先生！ - 再快点！
- Come on, Mr. Grey! - Faster!

19
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:40,414
大人觉得乔治安娜还漂亮么？
I trust Your Grace still finds Georgiana an attractive girl?

20
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,518
当然了，斯宾塞夫人
Of course, Lady Spencer.

21
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:46,463
她是上流社会的才女，知节守礼
She's an accomplished lady of quality and devoted to her duties.

22
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:49,194
能说流利的法语，意大利语和拉丁语
She's fluent in French, Italian, Latin

23
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:52,100
精通骑术和舞仪，还…
and fully versed in horsemanship and dancing and...

24
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:56,073
是的，这些我都知道，她是您的骄傲
Yes, I'm aware of all that. She's a credit to you.

25
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,741
我实在想不出有什么
I can't think of anything that would stand in the way

26
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,007
能阻碍一场天作之合
of a singularly happy marriage.

27
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:05,414
公爵大人并不顾虑这些，斯宾塞夫人
These are not the issues that burden the Duke, Lady Spencer.

28
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:08,715
大人有繁衍子嗣之责
It is His Grace's duty to produce an heir.

29
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:10,187
反言之，若能为大人生下承业之子
On the other hand, your daughter may expect

30
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,758
你的女儿必有厚报
a handsome reward when that occurs.

31
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:16,158
- 谢谢，希顿 - 大人
- Thank you, Heaton. - Your Grace.

32
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,195
大人您尽可放心
Your Grace may rest assured.

33
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,757
本家族女子在这方面从未有失
The women in our family have never forfeited on that account.

34
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,664
那好，既然有此保证…
Well, with that assurance...

35
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,473
就这么办吧
So be it, then.

36
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,516
冲啊，格雷先生！
Come on, Mr. Grey!

37
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:53,761
很抱歉，女士们，我的马赢了
I do apologize, ladies, but it appears that my horse has won.

38
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,097
查尔斯，再比一次试试
Beat me again, Charles.

39
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:02,903
- 干得好，格雷先生 - 干得好
- Well done, Mr. Grey. - Well done.

40
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,601
- 我们欠你多少？ - 你欠我40
- So how much do we owe you? - You owe me 40.

41
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:09,842
- 20，40 - 我的奖赏呢？
- Twenty, 40. - My reward?

42
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:17,422
你想要什么？
And what do you suggest?

43
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:20,516
你母亲要见你，乔治安娜小姐
Your mother wishes to see you, Lady Georgiana.

44
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,736
谢谢
Thank you.

45
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,858
对不起，妈妈，是不是我们太吵了？
I must apologize, Mama. Were we making too much noise?

46
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,517
不，我亲爱的
Not at all, my darling.

47
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,926
有重要事跟你说，过来
We have more important things to talk of. Come here.

48
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:09,508
- 我听到一个传言 - 什么传言？
- I have heard a rumor. - Yes?

49
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,707
我很快就要给我的女儿梳妆打扮
That I will soon be addressing my daughter

50
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,906
她很快就要变成德文郡公爵夫人了
as Her Grace, the Duchess of Devonshire.

51
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,111
- 是真的吗，妈妈？ - 是的
- Is it true, Mama? - It is.

52
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:24,455
德文郡公爵？
The Duke of Devonshire?

53
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:32,191
我本想将你晚些嫁人，至少等到18岁
I had hoped not to part with you until 18 at the soonest,

54
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:33,322
但有天赐良缘在前
but, with such a fine match,

55
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:36,027
再不放你走，我就太自私了
it would be selfish of me not to let you go.

56
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:38,035
- 他爱我么？ - 当然爱啦
- He loves me? - Yes, of course.

57
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:39,900
但我只见过他两次
I have only met him twice.

58
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,439
如果是真心相爱
When one truly loves someone,

59
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,941
不需要知根知底也能明白答案
one doesn't have to know them well to be sure, Georgiana.

60
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,045
这就是一见倾心
One feels it right away.

61
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:53,485
- 我确信，你跟他会幸福的 - 肯定会的，妈妈，我知道
- I do believe you will be happy with him. - I shall, Mama. I know I shall.

62
00:07:22,384 --> 00:07:28,674
片名：公爵夫人

63
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:32,874
- 来啊！ - 她来了！
- Come on! - She's here!

64
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:35,078
公爵夫人！公爵夫人！
Your Grace! Your Grace!

65
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:44,891
- 是她！ - 公爵夫人！
- There she is! - Duchess!

66
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:47,465
他们想要干嘛？
What do they want?

67
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:50,365
当然是想来看我，还有我的新婚妻子
To see me and my new wife, of course.

68
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:55,599
也许会觉得讨厌，但你会很快习惯的
It can be a nuisance, but you'll get used to it.

69
00:08:30,197 --> 00:08:35,460
伦敦 德文郡公爵宅邸

70
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,460
欢迎您，夫人
Welcome, Your Grace.

71
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,984
来啊，小伙子们，雨果，雨果，过来
Come, boys. Come on. Hugo, Hugo. Come.

72
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:16,350
好，好，好，好
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

73
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:21,022
很好，对了，往这儿来
It's all right. Yes, yes. This way.

74
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,886
雨果，来，过来
Hugo. Come, boy. Come.

75
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:05,768
剪刀给我，你们退下
Scissors. You may go.

76
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,703
我这一辈子，一直没弄明白
For the life of me, I could never understand

77
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:44,003
为什么女人的衣服设计得如此繁复
why women's clothes must be so damn complicated.

78
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:49,545
这是我们女人用来表达自己的方式
It's just our way of expressing ourselves, I suppose.

79
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,883
你这话什么意思？
Whatever do you mean?

80
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:59,549
你们男人可以有很多途径表达自己
Well, you have so many ways of expressing yourselves,

81
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,891
而我们只能通过帽子和衣饰来表达
whereas we must make do with our hats and our dresses.

82
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:40,299
请你上床去，好么？
Would you go to the bed?

83
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,660
一个人必须履行自己的责任
One has to accept one's responsibility.

84
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,428
也许有些事看起来难以承受
Certain obligations come with marriage,

85
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,469
但结了婚就得在某些方面尽义务
no matter how burdensome they may seem.

86
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,334
我懂，但当我和他在一起的时候…
Yes, but when we are together...

87
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:59,842
我是说我们在一起亲密的时候
But when we are together, intimately, I mean...

88
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,277
我知道，是有点烦人
I know. It can be a bother.

89
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:05,145
等你给他养了儿子就好了
However, it is only until you have given him a son.

90
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:09,847
这种事会越来越少，他也不会逼你做了
Then the occasions will become fewer and less determined.

91
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,547
如果他时不时跟我说些什么
I think it might feel different

92
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:14,524
也许我会感觉好一点
if he would talk to me every once in a while.

93
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:18,586
不是说他不够亲切，但他从不和我说话
I mean, it's not that he's unkind, but he never talks to me.

94
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:19,960
我本以为他会像爸爸一样
I thought that he would be like Papa,

95
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:22,193
在那冰冷的外表下
that under his cool reserve

96
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,895
深藏着一颗多愁善感的心
there'd be a wealth of depth and sentiment,

97
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:30,533
但他对什么都不感兴趣，除了他的狗
but he isn't interested in anything, apart from his dogs.

98
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,474
对公爵大人别太苛求了，乔
Try not to be too hard on His Grace, G.

99
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:35,638
他只想好好履行他的职责
He's merely intent on fulfilling his duty.

100
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:40,117
你说想跟他交流，但又有什么好说的呢？
And as for talking to him, well, whatever is there to talk about?

101
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,847
您说得也没错
No, you're quite right.

102
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,185
我太傻了，还以为凭自己的水平
How foolish of me to think that I should be able to converse

103
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,282
能和我的丈夫交流
with my husband.

104
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:51,386
耐心，坚忍和顺从，这些是你的武器
Georgiana, equip yourself with patience, fortitude and resignation.

105
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,660
你很快就会有儿子，到那时你就明白了
A boy will come soon enough, and then you'll see.

106
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:09,072
而我们辉格党(该党反对绝对王权) 认为只有这样才是明智的选择
But we, the Whig Party, simply see this as just, right and sensible.

107
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:15,653
让独立之号角响彻美利坚 用黎明的丧钟送走奴隶制
Just to bring independence to America. Right to abolish the slave trade.

108
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:20,420
引自由之风吹拂普罗大众
And sensible to bring freedom to the common man,

109
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:25,486
在英格兰这片神宠之地
so the blessings of this blessed plot, this England,

110
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:30,535
所有子民能同享上帝的恩泽光辉
may be more equally enjoyed by all of its inhabitants.

111
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:40,773
请各位为宴会主人，也是我党的赞助人
I would like to propose a toast to our host and benefactor

112
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,874
公爵大人和美丽的新晋公爵夫人举杯
His Grace the Duke and his beautiful new Duchess.

113
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,782
请各位起身
Please be upstanding.

114
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:57,927
- 公爵大人和夫人！ - 公爵大人和夫人！
- The Duke and Duchess! - The Duke and Duchess!

115
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:09,435
很精彩的演说，福克斯先生
Excellent speech, Mr. Fox.

116
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:12,739
谢谢夸奖，在一群人之前演说总是不难
I thank you. It is always easier to address a congregation of friends,

117
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:16,747
尤其是当这帮人已经喝醉的时候
particularly when those friends are drunk.

118
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:20,751
夫人对福克斯先生的演讲有何高见？
And how did the Duchess find Mr. Fox's speech?

119
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:24,186
我得承认，我还不习惯政治演说
I must confess, I am not yet at ease with political speeches.

120
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,418
特别的遣词方式总让我 摸不透背后的真正含义
Their very form tends to obstruct my view of their actual meaning,

121
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:29,619
…如果那些言语另有所指
if such there be.

122
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,662
不知演说中哪部分的言语
In which particular section of the speech

123
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,494
让夫人感到“困惑”呢？
did the message elude Your Grace?

124
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:39,365
总的来说，我非常赞同您的观点
Well, I have great sympathy with your sentiments in general,

125
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:44,272
但我不明白您说的“我们辉格党人”
but I fail to fully comprehend how far we, the Whig Party, that is,

126
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:47,140
对自由一词的推行力度到底有多深
are fully committed to the concept of freedom.

127
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,214
- 我们主张扩大选举权范围 - 让所有人参加选举？
- We intend to extend the vote. - To all men?

128
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:54,776
当然不是，但肯定不止现在这些人 所谓“适度的自由”
Heavens, no. But certainly to more men. Freedom in moderation.

129
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,412
- “适度的自由”？ - 完全正确
- "Freedom in moderation"? - Precisely.

130
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,518
我相信您的苦心孤诣，福克斯先生,
I'm sure you are full of the best intentions, Mr. Fox,

131
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,993
但我要说，如果我有选举权
but I dare say I would not spend my vote,

132
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:08,795
如此模糊的声明是无法赢得我的选票的
if I had it, of course, on so vague a statement.

133
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:13,201
一个人要么自由，要么没有自由 自由的定义只有一种
One is either free or one is not. The concept of freedom is an absolute.

134
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,466
不可能有人适度的死亡
After all, one cannot be moderately dead

135
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:19,874
也不可能有适度的相爱，或者适度的自由
or moderately loved or moderately free.

136
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,880
这永远是一个非正即反的问题
It must always remain a matter of either or.

137
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:29,548
我想来说几句
I think it appropriate to say a few words.

138
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,849
当…
When...

139
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,171
你去卧室里找找
Could you check the chamber

140
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:57,476
- 看能不能找到… - 大人
- and see if you can find... - Your Grace.

141
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,074
…其他样式的法国蕾丝？
...different kinds of French lace?

142
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:05,946
- 有什么问题嘛？ - 没有
- Is anything the matter? - No.

143
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,161
- 您离席了 - 嗯，我已经吃完了
- You just left. - Yes. Well, I had done eating,

144
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:13,891
那些无聊的讲话我听厌了，烦死了
and those damn speeches bore me to distraction.

145
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:16,160
看来下次得下禁令，不得发言
I think we have to ban them in the future.

146
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:20,227
但您是辉格党的主要拥护人啊
But you are the Whigs' main supporter.

147
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,899
没错，我对政治并不反感
Yes. Well, I've no problem with the politics.

148
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:25,602
只是我无法忍受那些个夸夸其谈
It's just the rhetoric I can't stand.

149
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:33,574
- 要我陪您去么？ - 我看不用了，这又何必呢？
- Shall I come with you? - No. I mean, why ever should you?

150
00:17:56,976 --> 00:18:00,707
公爵一切都好，只想小憩片刻
The Duke is perfectly well. He simply wanted to rest a while.

151
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,713
先生们，请坐吧
Do sit down, gentlemen.

152
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:13,723
是不是公爵对演讲的长度颇有微辞啊？
Was it the length of the speech that got the better of the Duke?

153
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,590
当然不是
Certainly not.

154
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:17,719
他非常喜欢您的演讲
He enjoyed it immensely

155
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,561
他还说希望下次的演讲再长一些就好了
and expressed a hope that next time it would be even longer.

156
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:26,894
- 夫人请 - 福克斯先生请
- Your Grace. - Mr. Fox.

157
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:57,626
- 发生了什么事？ - 跟你无关
- What's going on? - Nothing to concern you.

158
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:02,337
- 我不明白 - 到这边来
- I don't understand. - Come here.

159
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:15,214
今晚你看上去很漂亮 裙子是你自己设计的？
You look very beautiful tonight. Is this dress your design?

160
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,722
是的，谢谢
Yes, it is. Thank you.

161
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:31,065
我想你应该不会反对你的丈夫…
Then I think you should allow your husband to appreciate it

162
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,138
对这裙子做进一步的欣赏吧
in a little more detail.

163
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,671
过来
Come here.

164
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:11,498
- 好，让他们进来 - 有客人？
- Yes, send them in. - Are we having company?

165
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:15,770
你不觉得这羊肉味道有些奇怪么？
Don't you think this mutton has a funny taste?

166
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:21,044
- 没有，我觉得很好 - 我觉得有点奇怪
- No. Not really, no. - I think it does.

167
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:36,590
乔，这是夏洛特，以后她和我们一起住
G, this is Charlotte, and she will be staying with us.

168
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,630
为什么？
Why?

169
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:57,618
因为她妈妈死了，她也没有别的地方可去
Because her mother is dead, and she has no other place to go.

170
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,922
你是这孩子的父亲？
Have you fathered that child?

171
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:10,033
她只是…只是一个小姑娘，乔 又不是什么世界末日
It's... It's only a little girl, G. It's hardly the end of the world.

172
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:16,632
- 你想让我照顾她？ - 这儿有很多空房间
- Are you expecting me to look after her? - We have a house full of vacant rooms.

173
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:19,404
她不会打扰你的 事实上，她还能帮到你
She needn't bother you. In fact, she may even be of use to you.

174
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:22,207
可以先学着如何做母亲
You can practice your mothering skills,

175
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,077
直到我们的儿子出世
until our son arrives.

176
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,146
嗯，这羊肉味道肯定不对
No, this doesn't taste like normal mutton.

177
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:36,591
肯定是有东西串了味，把它拿走好么？
I'm sure there is something the matter with it. Could you take it away?

178
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,364
你觉得这羊肉味道对不对？
Does it taste like normal mutton?

179
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:47,127
是不是有股味儿啊？给我过来
Does it taste like normal mutton? Come here.

180
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:52,101
觉得这羊肉味道对不对啊，小刁嘴？
Think it tastes like normal mutton, fussy dog?

181
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:54,202
谁是小刁嘴啊？
Who's a fussy mutton dog?

182
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,184
你的娃娃有名字么？
Does your doll have a name?

183
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:17,001
我打赌，她一定喜欢自己的新卧室
I bet you she loves being in her new bedroom.

184
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:24,074
给她取个名字吧，明天告诉我
You'll have to think of a name and let me know tomorrow.

185
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,373
你能给她想个好名字，对不对夏洛特？
Do you think you'll be able to do that, Charlotte?

186
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:30,645
我…
I...

187
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:33,684
- 请你先出去好么？ - 夫人…
- Would you leave us, please? - Your Grace.

188
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:47,958
你好，夏洛特
Hello, Charlotte.

189
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:55,869
我叫乔治安娜
My name is Georgiana.

190
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:22,055
- 晚上好 - 谢谢
- Good evening. - Thank you.

191
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,334
晚上好，女士们
Good evening, ladies.

192
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:34,002
夫人，您的肚子要是再长一寸 估计就会爆开
An inch more and I do believe Your Grace will explode.

193
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:37,343
恭维方面，谢里顿总是很在行
Sheridan always knows how to pay a compliment.

194
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:39,007
还得再等几周
Still a few more weeks to wait.

195
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:42,109
这么大的肚子，在您身上那是再合适不过了
A huge belly has never been more becoming on anyone.

196
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:46,247
这方面福克斯是专家，他每次经过镜子
Well, Fox, here, offers an expert opinion seeing, as he does, a giant belly

197
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:48,485
都能看到一个超大号的肚子
every time he passes a mirror.

198
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,255
如果把您的肚子搁到一个女人的身上 大家都会明白那是怎么回事
If your belly were on a woman, well, we'd all know what to think.

199
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:55,060
我亲爱的谢里顿，一小时之前 我的肚子就搁在一个女人的身上
My dear Sheridan, an hour ago my belly was on a woman.

200
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:56,930
你明白是怎么回事了么？
Now what do you think?

201
00:23:57,035 --> 00:24:01,165
以后再想冒犯福克斯先生 在开口之前最好先想清楚
That will teach you to insult Mr. Fox before the gaming has begun.

202
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,068
画得不错
It's very good.

203
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:15,983
下注时间结束
No more bets, please.

204
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:23,854
七点
Seven.

205
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:27,494
夫人又赢了
Her Grace wins again.

206
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,458
再赌一轮吗？
Another wager?

207
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:36,172
- 您没事吧，夫人？ - 夫人！
- Are you all right, Your Grace? - Your Grace!

208
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,306
是产前阵痛么？我妻子要生产了
Are those labor pains? My wife is in labor.

209
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:46,984
跟我走
Come along.

210
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:49,417
我想现在值得举杯庆祝
I think this calls for a toast.

211
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:52,354
今夜结束前，我也许就有继承人了
I may have an heir before the night is out.

212
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:57,260
女士们先生们，请允许我介绍： 德文郡六世公爵！
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the sixth Duke of Devonshire.

213
00:24:57,362 --> 00:25:00,422
德文郡六世公爵！
The sixth Duke of Devonshire!

214
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,125
- 大人 - 我没心情谈话
- Your Grace. - I am in no mood for a conversation.

215
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,958
- 大人 - 我没有心情说话
- Your Grace. - I am in no mood for a conversation.

216
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:32,291
我祷告时问上帝，我的女儿能否…
But, pray tell me, is my daughter...

217
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:36,094
你的女儿能否给我生儿子？
Is your daughter at all able to give me a son?

218
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,725
别灰心，大人
Take heart, Your Grace.

219
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:39,497
只要她身体康健，一定能生
As long as the mother is in good health,

220
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:41,595
就当这次失误是打草稿好了
consider this mishap a draft,

221
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,140
当成是将得贵子的保证
a promise of what is soon to come.

222
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:47,372
- 在我们家族… - 我知道，在你们家
- In our family, we... - Yes, I know, in your family,

223
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,106
在你们家
in your family.

224
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:53,682
大人，告退
Your Grace.

225
00:25:56,855 --> 00:26:00,291
看到光没有？看到没有？
Can you see the light? Can you see it?

226
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,896
- 你好么，亲爱的？ - 还好
- Darling, how are you? - Quite well.

227
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:16,573
- 她健康么，壮实么？ - 她十分完美
- Is she strong and healthy? - She's perfect.

228
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:25,547
- 威廉他见你了没有？ - 见了
- Did William receive you? - Yes.

229
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:29,585
她不是男孩，他很失望吧？
Is he upset that she's not a son?

230
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:35,490
他只看了她一眼就走了，之后就不见人影
He just glanced at her and then left. I've hardly seen him since.

231
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,585
亲爱的，大人现在也很不好受
It's been a difficult time for His Grace, my dear.

232
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:41,154
他现在是许多目光的焦点 其中有一些目光绝非善意
Many eyes are upon him and not all of them kind.

233
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,333
她真是太可爱了
She is the loveliest.

234
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,474
- 保姆呢？ - 不用，我自己喂她
- Nurse? - No, I will feed her.

235
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:53,908
- 你真要喂她么？ - 是的
- Are you sure, darling? - Yes.

236
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:02,215
即使是女孩，怎么说我也是她的母亲
I am her mother, after all, even if she is only a girl.

237
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:06,023
来喽
There.

238
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:09,455
该死的混账！
Hell and damnation!

239
00:27:16,726 --> 00:27:20,455
六年之后

240
00:27:23,726 --> 00:27:26,455
哈瑞尔    小乔    夏洛特

241
00:27:45,726 --> 00:27:51,355
巴斯镇

242
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,131
人在度假的时候
It is always a pleasure

243
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:57,140
如能聆得一段奇智妙语，总是一桩乐事
when one is on holiday to request a few words of wisdom.

244
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,834
在此我也不多费口舌了
And so without further ado,

245
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:03,643
下面郑重推出今晚最尊贵的客人
it is a great honor to hand over to our most distinguished guest.

246
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:06,774
这位贵客在场时，是所有目光的焦点
When she arrives, all eyes are upon her.

247
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:10,912
不在场时，她依然是一切话题的中心
When absent, she is the subject of universal conversation.

248
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,013
今晚她亮相时所穿的衣着
And what we see her wearing tonight,

249
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:17,083
到了明天估计就会人手一件了
I look forward to seeing the rest of you wearing tomorrow!

250
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:22,292
有请引领时尚的女皇，德文郡公爵夫人！
The empress of fashion herself, the Duchess of Devonshire.

251
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:34,238
我们来巴斯，是为了远离伦敦
We come away to Bath to get away from London,

252
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:36,541
谁知整个伦敦都跟着来了巴斯
and all of London has come away to Bath.

253
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,013
有人还真开口问过我
Somebody did indeed ask me

254
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,609
我头上戴的是什么鸟的羽毛
what kind of feather it is that I'm wearing.

255
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:46,748
据说这种珍奇的鸟类，一共只发现了两只
Well, there are only two specimens of this rare bird known to man.

256
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:51,124
很显然其中一只已在我的头顶上安息了
One of them has clearly ended up on top of my head.

257
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:55,495
至于那另一只，传闻说已经跑到 托利党(该党支持世袭王权)的办公室去了
And the other, rumor has it, is running for office in the Tory Party.

258
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,490
贝丝・福斯特
Bess Foster.

259
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:33,868
请原谅
Excuse me.

260
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:15,208
- 我们还没有彼此介绍过 - 是还没有，我是伊丽莎白・福斯特夫人
- I don't believe we've been introduced. - No, we haven't. Lady Elizabeth Foster.

261
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:19,841
- 我刚才看见你和我丈夫说话来着 - 是的，他想请我跳舞
- I saw you talking with my husband. - Yes. He wanted to dance.

262
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:26,046
这可不是他的擅长啊，你拒绝了没有？
That's not usually considered his forte. And you declined?

263
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:30,455
我现在没兴致找男士作陪
I'm ill at ease with male company for the moment.

264
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:35,029
谢谢
Thank you.

265
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:38,127
你为什么来巴斯？
So what brings you to Bath?

266
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:44,969
我丈夫正在伯恩茅斯与情人寻欢作乐
My husband, Mr. Foster, is enjoying his mistress in Bournemouth

267
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:48,045
我来这儿解解闷，你呢？
and I wanted some diversion. And you?

268
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:54,215
公爵想借这儿的温泉治疗痛风
The Duke is taking the waters for his gout.

269
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,715
- 我跟他一起来调养身体 - 真的？
- And I for my health. - Really?

270
00:30:58,656 --> 00:31:02,057
我听说你们来这儿的原因是你无法育子
I heard you were here because you could not conceive a son.

271
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:06,494
我很抱歉，说这种话太失礼了
I beg your pardon, that was an awful thing to say.

272
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:08,293
至少这是事实
It was the truth, at least.

273
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,027
请原谅我说傻话，我总是口没遮拦
Trust me to say something silly. I always do, you know.

274
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:14,071
那你就该答应公爵的请求
Then perhaps you should have accepted the Duke's offer.

275
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:16,140
你们两个有许多共同点
You have much in common.

276
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:30,747
我们回去吧，乔治安娜
Home, I think, Georgiana.

277
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:43,024
- 你住在哪儿？ - 我在镇上租了几间房
- Where are you staying? - I've rented some rooms in town.

278
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:46,669
- 我们一定还会再见的 - 一定会的
- We must meet again. - We must.

279
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:07,524
哈瑞儿，过来，到这儿来…摔疼了没有？
Harryo. Come here. Come here. Did that hurt?

280
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:10,116
- 妈妈 - 我的小天使
- Mama. - My angel.

281
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:15,395
疼不疼？那儿疼么？让我看看 是不是这只膝盖？
Are you sore? Was that sore? Let me have a look. Was it this knee?

282
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:18,598
没事，你不会死的
I think you shall live.

283
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:23,197
好了，看谁先跑到桥那里，听我口令 一，二，三…跑！
Right. First to the bridge on my count. One, two, three. Go.

284
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:24,536
来啊，哈瑞儿
Come on, Harryo.

285
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:27,805
- 不，我能赶上她的！ - 我要追上你！
- No, I'm gonna catch her! - I'm gonna catch you!

286
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:32,110
跌倒爬起，跌倒爬起… 为什么我们就不能恢复得那么快呢？
Up and down. Up and down. Why can't we recover like that?

287
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:34,185
因为我们在跌倒前，已经走了太长的路
It's too far to fall now.

288
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:37,777
- 又见面了 - 你好，你的几个女儿真可爱
- Hello again. - Hello. Your girls are lovely.

289
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:42,883
- 谢谢，你有孩子么？ - 有，三个男孩
- Thank you. Do you have any children? - I do. Three boys.

290
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:45,625
三个男孩
Three boys.

291
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:48,631
要能分一个男孩给公爵 估计他什么都肯拿出来
What the Duke wouldn't give for one of them.

292
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:57,173
- 你的大女儿最不像你 - 是的，我想其中的故事你应该知道
- She is least like you, your eldest. - Yes. I'm sure you know the story.

293
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:04,746
我丈夫的大女儿是在我们结婚前出世的
My husband's daughter was born before we married.

294
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:08,808
她的母亲是一名女仆 女仆死后，孩子就交给我们带了
Her mother was a maid. The maid died, and we took the child.

295
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,787
- 对不起，我又说了不该说的 - 没事
- I'm sorry. Have I spoken out of turn? - No.

296
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:15,587
在伦敦，这是人尽皆知的秘密 她现在已经九岁了
It's the worst-kept secret in London. She's nine years old now.

297
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:17,422
你爱她么？
And you love her?

298
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:20,429
当然爱，我对她视如己出
Of course I do. The same as all my children.

299
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:26,232
来，我给你介绍一下
Come and meet them.

300
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:30,068
姑娘们，来认识一下妈妈的新朋友 伊丽莎白夫人
Girls. Come and meet my new friend, Lady Elizabeth.

301
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:40,443
- 夫人，给你 - 谢谢…这是温泉水
- Your Grace. - Thank you. Thermal water.

302
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:44,387
那股怪味是因为里面有硫黄
It's the sulfur that makes it smell so bad.

303
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:48,323
- 你真的要把这个喝了？ - 每天两杯，连喝四周
- And you really have to drink it? - Twice a day for four weeks.

304
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:53,822
难道你相信自己真的不能生男孩？
Do you have any reason to believe you cannot birth a male?

305
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:57,459
流产前，我一直不信这个
No. Except miscarriages.

306
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,831
两个死胎，都是男孩
Two stillbirths, both sons.

307
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,741
但我也生了两个健康的女孩
But two healthy girls.

308
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:19,082
每个人都看着你
Everybody is staring at you.

309
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:28,562
你头颈后面是什么？贝丝？
What's that on your neck? Bess?

310
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:33,935
法律规定男人不能用棍子抽打妻子
It's not illegal for a man to beat his wife with a stick

311
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:37,030
除非使用的棍子比他的拇指更细
unless the stick is thicker than his thumb.

312
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:41,100
福斯特先生？他怎么能这么做！
Mr. Foster? But he can't have done that!

313
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:43,806
比起他对我做的其他事，这还不算最糟
Well, considering what else he's done to me, that's not the worst.

314
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,348
还有什么更糟的事？
What could possibly be worse?

315
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:48,613
他带走了我的孩子，还不准我见他们
He's taken my children. He won't let me see them.

316
00:34:54,993 --> 00:34:59,327
- 那你打算怎么办？ - 说实话，我已经无计可施了
- And what do you propose to do? - Really, I'm at my wits' end.

317
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:03,860
法律站在福斯特先生一边
The law supports Mr. Foster.

318
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:09,496
那现在你打算去哪儿栖身？
In the meantime, where shall you stay?

319
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,405
继续租房，直到钱花光为止
Continue lodging, till the money runs out.

320
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:19,314
那这样吧，这方面我还能帮点忙
Well, there, at least, I think I can help.

321
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:28,989
威廉？明天我们就要离开这儿了
William? We leave tomorrow.

322
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:36,094
伊丽莎白夫人的娘家在欧洲大陆
And Lady Elizabeth doesn't have to meet her parents on the continent

323
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,395
她也不急着回去
for some time.

324
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:43,372
- 她几乎没怎么去过伦敦 - 那倒是个遗憾
- She hardly ever visits London at all. - It's a pity, that.

325
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:49,077
那什么，在伦敦她也没地方可住
You see, she doesn't have anywhere to stay.

326
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,573
这倒是个问题
Problem there.

327
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:00,748
那好，让她和我们一起住如何？ 先住上一阵再说
Well, why doesn't she stay with us? For a while, at least.

328
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:04,425
谢谢您
Thank you.

329
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,834
- 太不可思议了 - 那是在爱尔兰的城堡
- This is incredible. - There's the castle in Ireland.

330
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:18,239
博尔顿修道院，奇斯威克，伯灵顿， …哦，当然还有查茨沃思
Bolton Abbey, Chiswick, Burlington and, why, in Chatsworth, of course.

331
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:21,334
- 那是当然 - 那一处比别处大得多
- Of course. - Which is much bigger.

332
00:36:21,446 --> 00:36:23,539
但这儿更像家
But this is more like home.

333
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:30,911
有你在这儿，我说不出有多高兴
I'm so glad you're here.

334
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,718
我还准备了一出很精彩的开场节目
I've arranged a wonderful start to the season.

335
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:41,931
要是我再试着跟你修好
May all the plagues of marriage be doubled on me

336
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:47,232
就让婚姻的不幸加倍降临在我的身上！
if ever I try to be friends with you anymore!

337
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,067
要是这样就好了
So much the better.

338
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:56,402
不，不，夫人。你显然对我毫不关心
No, no, madam. 'Tis evident you care not a pin for me!

339
00:36:56,948 --> 00:37:01,214
我当初娶你的时候准是发疯了
And I, I was a madman to marry you.

340
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:05,653
我当初嫁你的时候准是糊涂了
And I'm sure I was a fool to marry you,

341
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:09,123
一个看见女人就追的王老五
an old dangling bachelor

342
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:14,226
五十岁了还是个光棍
who was single at 50

343
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:18,393
只因为找不到肯嫁他的人！
only because he never could meet with anyone who could have him!

344
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:43,992
贝丝, 这位是反对党领袖福克斯先生
Bess, may I introduce Mr. Fox, leader of the Opposition?

345
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:47,496
- 福克斯先生, 这是伊丽莎白・福斯特夫人 - 福克斯先生
- Mr. Fox, Lady Elizabeth Foster. - Mr. Fox.

346
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:51,694
- 我的门生，查尔斯・格雷 - 格雷先生
- My protege, Charles Grey. - Mr. Grey.

347
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:53,429
- 格雷先生 - 夫人
- Mr. Grey. - Your Grace.

348
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:55,972
他是我们年轻的新星
He's our newest bright young man.

349
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:59,907
刚从剑桥毕业不久，已经是国会成员了
Scarcely out of Cambridge and already a member of Parliament.

350
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:04,045
- 我就知道你会有作为的 - 谢谢
- I always felt you'd do well. - Thank you.

351
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:06,378
- 福克斯先生 - 好的，伊丽莎白夫人
- Mr. Fox. - Yes, Lady Elizabeth.

352
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:13,381
- 喜欢刚才的戏嘛？ - 坦白的说，不是很喜欢
- Did you enjoy the play? - I must confess, I did not entirely.

353
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:17,191
希望涉足政界的你…
I hope that you've not lost your sense of humor

354
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,855
- 那份幽默感还没丢 - 据我所知还在
- since entering politics. - Not that I'm aware.

355
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,556
那我想你应该知道
Then I'm sure you realize that School for Scandal

356
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:24,692
- “造谣学校”这部戏是一部喜剧 - 我知道
- was written as a comedy. - Yes.

357
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:28,795
但就我观戏的感受，这好像是一出悲剧
Although, from where I sat, it read as a tragedy.

358
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:32,842
公爵夫人！我们太想念您了
Your Grace! How we have missed you.

359
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:33,933
您不在的时候
In your absence,

360
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:36,775
伦敦成了最最无聊的城市
London has been reduced to the dreariest province.

361
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:39,611
这位就是剧作家谢里顿先生
And this, of course, is the playwright Mr. Sheridan.

362
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:42,015
请允许我介绍伊丽莎白・福斯特夫人
May I present the Lady Elizabeth Foster?

363
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:43,245
恕我无礼
I do not mean to be rude,

364
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:45,515
剧组全体正翘首企盼公爵夫人的接见呢
but I've an entire cast dying to meet the Duchess.

365
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:48,353
去去就回，我保证
I shall return you in a moment. Promise.

366
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,129
- 福克斯先生？ - 嗯
- Mr. Fox? - Yes.

367
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,254
借一句说话
A word.

368
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:57,994
让我上哪儿再去搜集这么多家庭琐事呢？
Well, wherever do I glean such domestic gossip?

369
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:01,196
- 这样做对公爵不太好吧？ - 我本来写的比这更夸张
- Were we fair on the Duke? - It could have been worse.

370
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:04,001
原先的剧本标题是“糟糕的婚姻”
My original title was The Bad Marriage.

371
00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:10,277
他们一直都是这样的吗？
Is it always like this?

372
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:12,178
呃，正如他们所说
Well, as they say,

373
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:14,513
英格兰惟一不爱公爵夫人的男人
the Duke of Devonshire must be the only man in England

374
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:16,519
就是德文郡公爵本人
not in love with his wife.

375
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:20,687
- 夫人，这位是德文郡公爵夫人 - 很高兴认识您
- Her Grace, the Duchess of Devonshire. - Very pleased to meet you.

376
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:32,593
刚才你有没有忘却旧愁，尽情享受？
Were you at all able to forget things and enjoy yourself?

377
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:36,639
我玩得非常开心，谢谢你
It was a wonderful distraction, thank you.

378
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:37,833
那就好
Good.

379
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:44,846
- 整晚我都在和格雷先生说话 - 是么？
- I talked to Mr. Grey all evening. - Yes?

380
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,374
他正恋着你呢
He's in love with you.

381
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:53,549
亲爱的贝丝，我觉得他没有 恐怕情况恰好相反
My dear Bess, no, he is not. Quite the reverse, I fear.

382
00:39:53,658 --> 00:39:57,355
他看你的那种方式，难道你看不出？
Well, can't you tell by the way he looks at you?

383
00:39:57,461 --> 00:40:00,396
- 说真的，你真觉察不到么？ - 别说了
- Honestly, can't you tell? - Stop it.

384
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:07,360
乔治安娜，交媾并非只是为了生儿育女
Georgiana, intercourse is not just about offspring.

385
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:14,272
- 实际上，这是一件很有乐趣的事 - 是的，我懂
- In fact, it can be rather pleasurable. - Yes, I know.

386
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:22,017
闭上眼睛，试着设想
Close your eyes and try to envisage Grey

387
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:26,249
格雷正在解开你的衣裙，亲吻你的后背
opening your dress, kissing your back.

388
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:29,349
- 他们才不会这样做呢 - 不，他们会这么做
- They never do such things. - Yes, they do.

389
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:38,593
把眼睛闭上
Close your eyes.

390
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:48,840
格雷在你身后，慢慢褪去你的衣衫
Grey is behind you slowly opening your dress.

391
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,346
- 别这样，贝丝，快住手！ - 把眼睛闭上
- No, Bess, stop! - Close your eyes.

392
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:09,559
亲吻着你的背
Kissing your back.

393
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:33,716
就是这样
There.

394
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,289
明白了么？
See?

395
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:11,088
- 对不起，我离开一会儿 - 请原谅，先生们
- Would you excuse me for a minute? - You must excuse me, gentlemen.

396
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,629
- 夫人 - 格雷先生
- Your Grace. - Mr. Grey.

397
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:16,359
还有六周就要全国大选了，对不对？
The national election is in six weeks, yes?

398
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:18,492
竞选活动进展如何？
How is the campaign going?

399
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,600
很糟糕
Terribly.

400
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:27,233
我们只希望福克斯能在西敏斯特留任
Our only hope is to save Westminster for Fox.

401
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:29,574
你应该也知道，我这人常犯错
I have many faults, as you well know.

402
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,309
但至少在吸引注意力方面，我很在行
Not least among them is my ability to draw attention.

403
00:42:34,452 --> 00:42:37,285
也许可以利用这一点为我方谋得利益
Perhaps we could use that to our advantage.

404
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,167
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen.

405
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:59,866
女士们先生们，我要介绍一位先生
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the man

406
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:02,673
他将告诉我们，什么才是应该做的
who will inform us of the work we must do

407
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:07,410
哪个党才值得我们信任 有请查尔斯・格雷先生
and of the party we so believe in. Mr. Charles Grey.

408
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,726
西敏斯特的好公民们！
Good people of Westminster!

409
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:24,131
这世界已走到灾难和浩劫的边缘！
The world is on the brink of disaster or salvation!

410
00:43:24,235 --> 00:43:25,896
从法兰西到美利坚
From France to America,

411
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:28,995
从男人到女人，都在为自身自由而奋斗
men and women are struggling to free themselves,

412
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:32,507
他们在寻找生存的真义！
to find meaning in their existence!

413
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,101
变革就在我们眼前！
Change is upon us!

414
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:40,277
不能再走回老路了
We shall not go back to the old ways.

415
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:45,549
让我们带领英格兰勇敢迈进新世界
We shall take England into this brave new world

416
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:48,454
用一声惊雷震响整个天空！
and shake the thunder from the skies!

417
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:06,238
- 我表现如何？ - 说不上令人难堪
- How did I do? - I think it was not an embarrassment.

418
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:09,975
应该说非常精彩
It was a marvel.

419
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:14,073
我当时很紧张，您的大驾光临 使到场人数至少翻了三倍
I was nervous. Your presence trebled the numbers at least.

420
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:19,885
现在的我比刚才更加紧张
I'm nervous even now.

421
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:25,928
如果能赢下这场选举，执掌政权
If we win this election, if we get the power,

422
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,998
想想到时候我们会怎么做
think what we will do.

423
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:30,896
我们分开的时候，你会想我么？
Do you think of me when we're not together?

424
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:35,594
你该明白，那是肯定的
You ought to know I do.

425
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:38,334
- 在回答之前，你犹豫了 - 没有
- You hesitated before you replied. - No.

426
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:50,780
我不太习惯面对如此直接的提问
I'm unused to being asked so directly.

427
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,216
这么多人里，偏偏是你来问我
And by you, of all people.

428
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:03,767
我无时无刻不在想你，从未改变过
I think of you all the time. I always have.

429
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:13,433
- 夫人，您的马车在等您 - 谢谢
- Your carriage awaits, Your Grace. - Thank you.

430
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,711
…我们发誓！
...this we vow!

431
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:48,272
你们在伊丽莎白夫人的卧室外做什么？
What are you doing outside Lady Elizabeth's room?

432
00:45:53,651 --> 00:45:55,619
她和谁在里面？
Who's in there with her?

433
00:47:01,883 --> 00:47:07,879
英格兰有那么多女人 你偏要把她压在身子下面
Of all the women in England you had to throw yourself on her.

434
00:47:12,093 --> 00:47:17,622
你的风流韵事，我从没表示过反对
I have never once objected to any of your affairs.

435
00:47:19,934 --> 00:47:23,995
你安排的所有活动，我一概接受服从
I have accepted whatever arrangement you have proposed.

436
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:29,303
我还把夏洛特当作亲生女儿抚养
I have raised Charlotte as my own daughter.

437
00:47:32,347 --> 00:47:33,712
但是这个…
But this...

438
00:47:36,818 --> 00:47:40,948
好不容易才有一件属于自己的东西
I have one single thing of my own.

439
00:47:44,192 --> 00:47:47,389
为什么不能把伊丽莎白留给我呢？
Why couldn't you let me keep Elizabeth for myself?

440
00:47:49,797 --> 00:47:52,425
你究竟算什么玩意儿啊？
What kind of man are you?

441
00:47:55,570 --> 00:48:01,270
她是我婚姻生活中仅有的慰藉 你却把我唯一的朋友生生抢走！
She is my sole comfort in our marriage. You have robbed me of my only friend!

442
00:48:10,752 --> 00:48:12,617
我有什么不对？
What is wrong with me?

443
00:48:38,012 --> 00:48:39,070
我…
I...

444
00:48:41,115 --> 00:48:47,486
我从不认为自己是个善解人意的男人
I've never claimed to be a man of fine sensibility, G.

445
00:48:47,588 --> 00:48:50,853
但我一直清楚这桩婚姻应该给我什么
But I've always known what I expect from this marriage

446
00:48:50,958 --> 00:48:53,188
以及对此我该付出些什么
and what I'm prepared to give.

447
00:48:54,462 --> 00:48:58,455
作为丈夫，我履行了应尽的义务
As a husband, I have fulfilled my obligations.

448
00:48:58,566 --> 00:49:01,831
但是作为妻子
But, as a wife,

449
00:49:04,205 --> 00:49:06,332
你却没有尽职尽责
you have not.

450
00:49:06,441 --> 00:49:09,842
她必须离开，马上走
She has to go. Now.

451
00:49:09,944 --> 00:49:12,538
不许她再踏进这个家一步！
She is never to set foot in this house again!

452
00:49:12,647 --> 00:49:14,581
请注意控制你的情绪，乔 你似乎忘记了自己的身份
Do mind your temper, G. You're forgetting yourself.

453
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:17,574
我要她滚
I want her out.

454
00:49:19,821 --> 00:49:24,554
我再也不想见到她 你下去跟她说，让她马上走
I never want to lay eyes on her again. Go down and tell her to leave at once.

455
00:49:29,163 --> 00:49:31,097
我不会让她走的
I couldn't ask her that.

456
00:49:33,768 --> 00:49:35,395
我不愿意这么做，乔
I won't do it, G.

457
00:49:52,687 --> 00:49:57,886
- 第一眼见到她，我就不喜欢 - 你已经说过了，妈妈
- I never liked her from the first. - You made that quite clear, Mama.

458
00:49:57,992 --> 00:50:00,722
她已经不在公爵宅邸了吧
She's gone from Devonshire House, I hope.

459
00:50:04,799 --> 00:50:06,790
他们现在住在一起？
They're living there together?

460
00:50:06,901 --> 00:50:09,233
乔治安娜！你怎么能答应这种事情？
Georgiana! What have you permitted to happen?

461
00:50:09,337 --> 00:50:12,966
我不知道，我不知道
I don't know. I don't know.

462
00:50:13,074 --> 00:50:16,771
帮帮我，求你帮帮我，妈妈 告诉我应该怎么办
Help me. Help me, please, Mama. Tell me what to do.

463
00:50:21,282 --> 00:50:25,378
给你的丈夫写信，坚持让他把人送走
You must write to your husband and insist he send her back

464
00:50:25,486 --> 00:50:27,647
不管她原来住得多烂，哪儿来就回哪儿去
to whatever horrid little place she came from.

465
00:50:27,755 --> 00:50:32,522
他不会照办的 他说过：“你想都别想”
He will not. "It is out of the question," he says.

466
00:50:38,266 --> 00:50:42,100
那你就回去，继续履行你的义务
Then you must return and resume your duties.

467
00:50:42,203 --> 00:50:44,728
让他明白，谁才是他的真爱
Make him realize whom he loves.

468
00:50:44,839 --> 00:50:47,603
把政治活动和赌博游戏先放一放
You will give up your politics and your gambling.

469
00:50:47,708 --> 00:50:51,007
你且专心做一回钟情的妻子
For once, you will devote yourself as a loving wife

470
00:50:51,112 --> 00:50:55,071
安心完成当前的要务，给他生个儿子
and settle down to the task in hand, providing him with an heir.

471
00:50:56,484 --> 00:50:58,714
很快他就会厌倦那个女人
Then he will soon tire of her.

472
00:51:07,528 --> 00:51:09,519
你别无选择
You have no other option.

473
00:51:48,469 --> 00:51:49,766
你好，乔
Hello, G.

474
00:51:52,039 --> 00:51:53,267
威廉
William.

475
00:52:26,707 --> 00:52:30,700
我虽无权把你赶出大宅
I may not have the authority to remove you from my house,

476
00:52:30,811 --> 00:52:33,439
但我至少可以命令你滚出我的房间
but I can, at least, order you out of my room.

477
00:52:33,547 --> 00:52:35,913
能不能容我解释？
Won't you please let me explain?

478
00:52:37,518 --> 00:52:38,576
没什么好解释的
There is nothing to explain.

479
00:52:38,686 --> 00:52:42,178
为了重新见到孩子，这是我唯一的机会
This is my only chance of ever seeing my children again.

480
00:52:43,457 --> 00:52:45,652
公爵他是英格兰最有权势的贵族
The Duke is the most powerful peer in England.

481
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:46,988
我只有他这一根救命稻草
He is my only chance.

482
00:52:47,094 --> 00:52:51,030
为夺回孩子而做的牺牲也得有个限度
There are limits to the sacrifices one makes for one's children.

483
00:52:51,132 --> 00:52:55,228
不对，根本不可能有限度
No, there aren't. No limits whatsoever.

484
00:52:58,372 --> 00:52:59,600
出去
Get out.

485
00:53:03,544 --> 00:53:06,513
我们两个已经没什么可说的了
We have nothing more to say to one another.

486
00:53:59,433 --> 00:54:00,764
妈妈，妈妈！
Mama, Mama!

487
00:54:08,175 --> 00:54:10,735
能见到您太好了，妈妈
It's so nice to see you, Mama.

488
00:54:10,845 --> 00:54:13,405
没错，这是一把猎枪
Right, this is a shotgun.

489
00:54:13,514 --> 00:54:15,448
你妈妈说你对枪很感兴趣，是不是？
Your mother said you'd be interested, yes?

490
00:54:15,549 --> 00:54:16,573
是的
Yes.

491
00:54:18,185 --> 00:54:19,880
这是打火石，看见没有？
This is a flint. Do you see?

492
00:54:19,987 --> 00:54:23,013
打火石击中这儿之后，就会产生火花
When the flint hits there, it causes a spark to happen.

493
00:54:23,124 --> 00:54:28,994
然后火花会点燃火药，把子弹推出枪膛
Now, the spark, it lights the gunpowder and sends the bullet out of the gun.

494
00:54:29,096 --> 00:54:31,223
- 你知道怎么拿枪么？ - 不知道，先生
- Do you know how to hold it? - No, sir.

495
00:54:31,332 --> 00:54:36,736
是这么个拿法，把这东西顶在右肩上
Well, it's like that. Tuck it in there, into your right shoulder.

496
00:54:36,871 --> 00:54:40,500
拿稳之后，把那只手往前挪一点
Hold it firmly, then you can move that hand a little further along.

497
00:54:40,608 --> 00:54:44,635
感觉到它有多重了吗？身体得稍稍前倾
Can you feel how heavy it is? You have to lean into it a bit.

498
00:54:44,745 --> 00:54:48,704
睁大双眼，顺着枪管看前方
And keep both eyes open. Look right along the barrel.

499
00:54:48,816 --> 00:54:51,182
就像这样，看着前面
Right along there just like that.

500
00:54:53,154 --> 00:54:57,056
砰！来，我示范给你看
Bang! Here, let me show you.

501
00:55:00,761 --> 00:55:02,092
瞧那儿
There.

502
00:55:02,997 --> 00:55:05,124
枪很沉，对不对？
It's quite heavy, isn't it?

503
00:55:06,467 --> 00:55:10,460
你口干么？要不要喝点东西？
Are you thirsty? Would you like something to drink?

504
00:55:10,571 --> 00:55:14,098
各位先生口渴么？要不要喝点什么？
Are you gentlemen thirsty? Would you like something to drink?

505
00:55:16,343 --> 00:55:17,674
谢谢你
Thank you.

506
00:56:11,499 --> 00:56:13,626
公爵知道你要和谁见面吗？
Did you tell the Duke who you were meeting?

507
00:56:13,734 --> 00:56:14,758
不知道
No.

508
00:56:15,636 --> 00:56:17,570
- 他没问过？ - 没有
- Did he even ask? - No.

509
00:56:18,706 --> 00:56:20,867
他的脑子在想别的事
He has other things on his mind.

510
00:56:22,576 --> 00:56:23,975
你也一样
As do you.

511
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:30,883
向我倾诉心事，能不能让你好受一些？
Would it help to unburden yourself?

512
00:56:33,654 --> 00:56:36,145
我没什么能向你倾诉的
It's nothing I can discuss with you.

513
00:56:38,058 --> 00:56:40,151
而且，说这些只会令人厌烦
Besides, it would only bore.

514
00:56:41,095 --> 00:56:44,030
你没必要总想着让别人好受
You don't have to please others all the time.

515
00:56:44,131 --> 00:56:48,158
从小到大，我一直在学如何让别人好受 要忘却这些东西，很难
It's what I've been brought up to do. Difficult lesson to unlearn.

516
00:56:51,739 --> 00:56:54,207
允许我发表几句评论么？
Would you permit me an observation?

517
00:56:58,512 --> 00:57:01,640
我觉得你这么做，是为了让别人喜欢你
I believe you do it so that people will love you.

518
00:57:02,483 --> 00:57:05,543
- 这么说有什么根据呢？ - 根据本人的所见所闻
- What makes you say that? - From what I've seen.

519
00:57:07,288 --> 00:57:12,316
你的丈夫，你的朋友，特别是贝丝夫人…
With your husband, your friends, especially Lady Bess,

520
00:57:14,562 --> 00:57:16,154
连大众也是一样
even the public.

521
00:57:18,299 --> 00:57:20,893
我以前从没这么想过
I never thought of it that way before.

522
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:25,065
你让我觉得自己更加可悲了
You make me sound so pitiable.

523
00:57:30,945 --> 00:57:32,242
乔治安娜
Georgiana.

524
00:57:34,481 --> 00:57:38,247
我不该无礼多嘴，向你道歉
I've gone beyond my brief. I apologize.

525
00:57:40,154 --> 00:57:43,555
请相信我，说这些都是为了你好
Please believe it was only for your sake that I spoke.

526
00:57:44,858 --> 00:57:47,053
求求你告诉我，究竟是哪儿不对
Please, tell me what is wrong.

527
00:57:51,665 --> 00:57:55,499
我怕有些事自己做得太迟
I fear I've done some things in life too late

528
00:57:55,603 --> 00:57:57,434
而有些事来得又太早
and others too early.

529
00:58:02,076 --> 00:58:03,668
不，你没有
No, you haven't.

530
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:20,591
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

531
00:58:58,599 --> 00:58:59,930
谢谢
Thank you.

532
00:59:16,617 --> 00:59:17,948
好吧
All right.

533
00:59:21,288 --> 00:59:22,653
什么“好吧”？
"All right"?

534
00:59:26,193 --> 00:59:28,093
你们俩彼此相爱么？
Do you love each other?

535
00:59:30,831 --> 00:59:34,961
- 乔治安娜… - 大人，您爱贝丝吗？
- Georgiana... - Do you love Bess, Your Grace?

536
00:59:36,637 --> 00:59:40,129
- 你究竟想说什么？ - 我对他没有要求
- Where is all this leading? - I make no demands on him.

537
00:59:42,476 --> 00:59:46,537
- 那你呢贝丝，你爱我丈夫吗？ - 爱他就和爱你一样多
- And, Bess, do you love my husband? - As I do you.

538
00:59:49,616 --> 00:59:51,641
这么说你想留在这里？
And so you intend to stay?

539
00:59:54,688 --> 00:59:56,781
威廉要我留在这里
William has asked that I do.

540
00:59:58,192 --> 01:00:01,355
你的内心就没想过要拒绝他？
You couldn't find it in your heart to refuse him?

541
01:00:03,597 --> 01:00:04,689
没有
No.

542
01:00:09,036 --> 01:00:10,962
那我们做一笔交易吧
Then let us make a deal.

543
01:00:11,905 --> 01:00:14,533
- 一笔交易？ - 是的
- A deal? - Yes.

544
01:00:17,378 --> 01:00:20,575
我愿意成全你们两个
I give you my blessing

545
01:00:20,681 --> 01:00:24,549
只要你肯接受我对查尔斯・格雷的感情
if you will accept my feelings for Charles Grey.

546
01:00:27,087 --> 01:00:28,679
一开始我没意识到
I didn't realize it at first.

547
01:00:28,789 --> 01:00:32,316
我以为那也许只是逢场作戏
I thought that perhaps it was only a dalliance.

548
01:00:33,794 --> 01:00:35,591
和他在一起能让我快乐
It can make me happy.

549
01:00:40,501 --> 01:00:43,299
一笔交易？一笔交易
A deal? A deal.

550
01:00:44,872 --> 01:00:46,635
我从不做什么交易
I don't make deals.

551
01:00:47,775 --> 01:00:49,208
有这必要么？
Why would I?

552
01:00:51,745 --> 01:00:52,939
我掌控着一切
I'm in charge of it all.

553
01:00:53,046 --> 01:00:57,608
我可以把他约出来，然后责问他
You know, I would call him out. I would challenge him.

554
01:00:57,718 --> 01:00:59,345
- 我会用子弹射穿他的脑袋 - 威廉
- I'd put a bullet in his head. - William.

555
01:00:59,453 --> 01:01:03,549
别说话 你铁了心，想让我变成别人的笑柄？
Be quiet. Are you determined to make me a total laughingstock?

556
01:01:03,657 --> 01:01:06,387
给一个无法续嗣的男人再戴一顶绿帽子？
A man who cannot sire a son, and then a cuckold?

557
01:01:06,493 --> 01:01:08,654
威廉，乔治安娜只想问问我们…
William. Georgiana only asks what we ourselves...

558
01:01:08,762 --> 01:01:10,354
不许说话，婊子！
Be quiet, woman!

559
01:01:12,499 --> 01:01:15,059
- 你跟他苟且了？ - 没有
- Are you his whore? - No.

560
01:01:16,336 --> 01:01:18,497
我也不明白，你为什么如此介意
But I can't see why you'd mind.

561
01:01:18,605 --> 01:01:22,006
- 你已经有贝丝和三个儿子了！ - 三个儿子？
- You have Bess and three boys! - Three boys?

562
01:01:24,211 --> 01:01:27,305
你说我会认那些个小杂种做继承人嘛？
Do you think I can make those bastards my heirs?

563
01:01:29,149 --> 01:01:30,980
嗯？你说说看？
Well? Do you?

564
01:01:41,161 --> 01:01:42,423
威廉！
William!

565
01:02:14,695 --> 01:02:16,686
你压根就不了解我，是不是？
You don't know me in the least, do you?

566
01:02:16,797 --> 01:02:18,594
不，我了解你，我们完全不合拍
Yes, I do. We're a bad match.

567
01:02:18,699 --> 01:02:22,897
结婚时我对你只有两个要求：忠贞和后嗣
I asked but two things when we wed, loyalty and a male heir.

568
01:02:23,003 --> 01:02:25,369
和你对狗的要求有什么两样！
The same as your dogs!

569
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:33,503
不，不许碰我！别碰我！
No, don't touch me! Don't touch me!

570
01:02:36,550 --> 01:02:37,847
走开！
Get off!

571
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:45,487
放开我！
Get off me!

572
01:02:45,592 --> 01:02:49,926
你就是这样对她的？ 你就是这样对待那个娼妇的？
Is this how you treat her? Is this how you treat your whore?

573
01:02:50,030 --> 01:02:52,055
不！不！
No! No!

574
01:02:53,233 --> 01:02:56,259
不！不！不！
No! No! No!

01:02:57,137 --> 01:02:58,399
不！
No!

576
01:03:02,576 --> 01:03:05,170
来，夏洛特，跟我走
Come with me. Charlotte, come with me.

577
01:03:06,346 --> 01:03:07,973
不！不！
No! No!

578
01:03:30,571 --> 01:03:36,806
给我生个儿子，在此之前 呆在这里，按我说的去做
Give me a son. Until then, stay here and do as I say.

579
01:03:53,293 --> 01:03:59,232

小心，乔

01:06:27,047 --> 01:06:29,413
请把夫人发套上的火给灭了
Please put out Her Grace's hair.

595
01:07:05,185 --> 01:07:07,210
夫人需要休息
Her Grace needs to rest.

596
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:09,379
如果严遵医嘱
As long as she follows strict instructions

597
01:07:09,489 --> 01:07:12,458
夫人生产时应该不会有什么大碍
there should be no impediment to the birth.

598
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:14,618
你说什么？
What are you talking about?

599
01:07:15,595 --> 01:07:17,654
公爵夫人有孕在身
The Duchess is pregnant.

600

621
01:10:05,532 --> 01:10:08,399
还没开始，但这只是时间问题

I assumed it was on behalf of the Party. I could not say no.

624
01:10:21,281 --> 01:10:22,612

01:15:21,948 --> 01:15:25,179
“夫人自从投身竞选事业之后…”
"Her Grace, ever since initiation into the business of electioneering,

654
01:15:25,285 --> 01:15:27,150
“似乎更钟情花边高帽了”
"has been much attached to the mobs."

655
01:15:27,253 --> 01:15:28,880
很好嘛
Very good.

656
01:15:32,592 --> 01:15:34,822
你最喜欢哪一个？
So which one is your favorite?

657
01:15:38,031 --> 01:15:40,226
- 看这张 - 嗯
- This one. - Yeah.

658
01:15:42,468 --> 01:15:45,699
这张图里的你似乎手气不错 终于连胜了几把
In this one it seems you've hit a winning streak, for once.

659
01:15:45,805 --> 01:15:47,170
不错啊
Very good.

660
01:15:49,976 --> 01:15:52,501
这张图里的你…
And in this one you see...

661
01:15:52,612 --> 01:15:56,412
穿这样的裙子很适合吸引投票者啊
Is that dress really an appropriate way to attract voters?

662
01:15:56,516 --> 01:15:59,952
你们这帮政客，根本不懂什么是时尚
You politicians know absolutely nothing about fashion.

663
01:16:01,454 --> 01:16:04,890
如果你真想问我最喜欢哪一个
But if you were to really ask me which my favorite was,

664
01:16:06,693 --> 01:16:08,661
那就是我面前的这一个
I'd say it was this one.

665
01:16:23,276 --> 01:16:25,369
- 早上好，查尔斯 - 早上好
- Morning, Charles. - Morning.

666
01:16:25,478 --> 01:16:26,911
祝您愉快，先生
Good day to you, sir.

667
01:16:52,572 --> 01:16:55,234
很完美，谢谢你
It's perfect. Thank you.

668
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:23,133
我们想给你一个惊喜，乔
Thought we would surprise you, G.

669
01:17:23,269 --> 01:17:26,102
我记得你曾经说过 在你我的婚姻中自发的东西太少
I think you once said there wasn't enough spontaneity in our marriage

670
01:17:26,205 --> 01:17:28,173
或者类似意思的话
or words to that effect.

671
01:17:31,711 --> 01:17:33,941
妈妈，你来这里干嘛？
Mama, what are you doing here?

672
01:17:35,581 --> 01:17:39,950
你在巴斯，应该见了不少朋友吧
So, have you seen many of our circle in Bath?

673
01:17:41,721 --> 01:17:42,847
见了一些
Some.

674
01:17:44,157 --> 01:17:49,493
寇克斯家族，哈沃福德，维克罗勋爵
The Cokes and Haverford and Lord Wicklow.

675
01:17:49,595 --> 01:17:53,122
也见了不少政客吧？开会之类的
Bunch of politicos, too, aren't there? Meetings and such.

676
01:17:54,133 --> 01:17:55,122
我想是吧
I believe.

677
01:17:55,234 --> 01:17:59,671
格雷他来了没有？ 我说的是查尔斯・格雷先生
Is Grey here? By which I mean Mr. Charles Grey.

678
01:18:00,606 --> 01:18:02,733
听说他也在这儿
Rumor has it that he is.

679
01:18:02,842 --> 01:18:04,571
- 我不会放弃他的 - 乔治安娜
- I won't give him up. - Georgiana.

680
01:18:04,677 --> 01:18:07,840
人人都有情人，贝丝就是我丈夫的情人
Everyone has a lover. Bess is the lover of my husband.

681
01:18:07,947 --> 01:18:09,608
如果你还有判断力的话
If you had shown some discretion,

682
01:18:09,715 --> 01:18:12,115
- 事情就不至于此 - 不至于此？
- it might have been different. - Different?

683
01:18:12,218 --> 01:18:14,652
不幸中的万幸是，这事还没被捅到报纸上
The only good fortune is it hasn't yet made it to the papers.

684
01:18:14,754 --> 01:18:18,588
亲爱的，格雷他还是单身，没钱没地位
My dear, Grey is unmarried. He has no wealth, no rank.

685
01:18:18,691 --> 01:18:22,127
这桩丑闻于他丝毫无损 所有的危险都在你这边
He risks nothing with this affair. The hazard is all yours.

686
01:18:22,228 --> 01:18:25,061
- 格雷他爱我 - 威廉也爱你
- Grey loves me. - So does William.

687
01:18:25,164 --> 01:18:28,565
没错，我爱你
Yes. I love you.

688
01:18:30,203 --> 01:18:31,431
怎么个爱法？
How?

689
01:18:33,239 --> 01:18:35,833
用我所理解的方式来表达爱
In the way I understand love.

690
01:18:38,878 --> 01:18:43,577
乔治安娜，你闹得太过火了 此事有损我们的尊严
Georgiana, this has gone much too far. It is beneath our dignity.

691
01:18:43,683 --> 01:18:46,049
- 伦敦上下都在谈论 - 让他们说去吧
- All London is talking. - Let them talk.

692
01:18:46,152 --> 01:18:48,677
如果是格雷让我变得堕落，那正好
If Grey makes me a fallen woman, well and good.

693
01:18:48,788 --> 01:18:51,279
威廉就能和我离婚 让贝丝做德文郡公爵夫人
Now William may divorce me and Bess becomes Duchess of Devonshire.

694
01:18:51,390 --> 01:18:53,255
这事决不可能发生
That will never happen.

695
01:18:55,461 --> 01:18:57,793
这事还是由你自己去解决吧
I think I will leave you to it.

696
01:19:03,336 --> 01:19:05,531
接下来呢？
What follows now?

697
01:19:05,638 --> 01:19:08,903
你是不是会扯掉我的衣服 再在我的身上施一次淫威？
Are you going to tear my clothes off and force yourself upon me again?

698
01:19:09,008 --> 01:19:11,203
我为什么要那么做？
Why on earth would I do that?

699
01:19:12,111 --> 01:19:17,378
对我的举止和才智，你从来没尊重过
I know that you've never thought much of my manners or my intellect, G.

700
01:19:18,451 --> 01:19:22,615
但事实上，我从不做毫无意义的事情
But, in fact, I never do anything that serves no purpose.

701
01:19:22,722 --> 01:19:25,589
我非常清楚你们两个发生了什么
I know precisely what you two have together.

702
01:19:25,691 --> 01:19:27,522
- 我们彼此相爱 - 对此我毫不怀疑
- We love each other. - I do not doubt it.

703
01:19:27,627 --> 01:19:29,322
他和你一样，是个理想主义者
He is a dreamer like yourself,

704
01:19:29,428 --> 01:19:34,024
你们俩都在幻想另一个虚幻的世界 那世界非但不存在，以后也不会有
and you both dream of another world that does not exist and it never will.

705
01:19:34,133 --> 01:19:37,762
现实是什么样，还是让我来开导你吧
As for reality, allow me to enlighten you.

706
01:19:38,971 --> 01:19:42,771
如果你不肯立即放弃这个男人
If you do not give him up at once, I will see to it

707
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:47,335
我定会让他在这个国家无家可归，一文不名
that every home and every checkbook in this country is closed to him.

708
01:19:47,446 --> 01:19:50,279
无论是国会厅前还是相府帏后
He will be welcomed neither in the halls of government

709
01:19:50,383 --> 01:19:52,977
他都会被扫地出门
nor in its backrooms of power.

710
01:19:53,085 --> 01:19:55,883
他立志成为首相的梦想
His dream of becoming prime minister

711
01:19:56,022 --> 01:20:02,359
还有你们改变世界的共同心愿 全都会灰飞烟灭
and your mutual fantasy of a changed world will be dead as ash.

712
01:20:06,332 --> 01:20:09,199
你也别想再见到你的孩子了
And you will never see your children again.

713
01:20:18,711 --> 01:20:20,042
乔治安娜
Georgiana.

714
01:21:05,424 --> 01:21:07,756
我请您即回伦敦
I must ask you to return to London.

715
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:09,828
- 你不走？ - 嗯
- Without you? - Yes.

716
01:21:18,337 --> 01:21:20,737
这些是我们女儿写的
These are from our girls.

717
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:25,106
小哈特还不会写字 当然了，他还不满一岁
Little Hart neglected to write, but then, of course, he's not yet one.

718
01:21:36,622 --> 01:21:40,581
- 这将是你一生最大的错误 - 错了
- This will be the mistake of your life. - No.

719
01:21:43,095 --> 01:21:45,222
许多年之前，我就已经犯过了
I made that many years ago.

720
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:50,666
我相信你自己能出去
I trust you can see yourself out.

721
01:22:11,057 --> 01:22:13,890
- 该死的，快把门打开！ - 大人
- Damn you, man, open the door! - Your Grace.

722
01:24:12,278 --> 01:24:15,270
妈妈，妈妈，妈妈，妈妈！
Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama!

723
01:24:19,852 --> 01:24:21,615
妈妈，妈妈，妈妈
Mama, Mama, Mama.

724
01:24:40,139 --> 01:24:43,472
- 走吧，姑娘们 - 我爱你，妈妈
- Come on, girls. - Mama. I love you.

725
01:24:43,576 --> 01:24:47,376
快点，姑娘们，妈妈很快就会出来的
Girls, run along. Your mother will join you in a minute.

726
01:24:47,479 --> 01:24:48,707
快点
Come on.

727
01:24:51,851 --> 01:24:53,182
走吧
Run along.

728
01:24:57,623 --> 01:24:58,647
乔
G.

729
01:25:12,938 --> 01:25:14,701
你我终于达成了协议
You must know how greatly pleased I am

730
01:25:14,807 --> 01:25:17,833
你知道我有多高兴么
that we have come to an arrangement.

731
01:25:17,943 --> 01:25:22,039
小孩子离开母亲太久了，对她们可不好
It's not good for little ones to be without their mother for so long.

732
01:25:22,147 --> 01:25:25,810
- 为了这，就要赔上我的一生 - 有个解决的办法
- My life for theirs. - That's one way of putting it.

733
01:25:28,487 --> 01:25:32,514
你妈妈把这叫做 “个人满足之前的习惯礼数”
Your mother called it "common decency before personal gratification,"

734
01:25:32,625 --> 01:25:35,458
或者类似的话，具体形容我记不清了
or some such thing. The exact words escape me.

735
01:25:35,561 --> 01:25:39,258
是不是“监禁在自己的家中”？
How about "imprisoned in my own house"?

736
01:25:41,967 --> 01:25:44,629
不是，她不是这么说的
No. That's not how she put it.

737
01:25:46,572 --> 01:25:48,767
如果是这种说法，我会记得的
I would have remembered that.

738
01:26:13,332 --> 01:26:14,959
乔治安娜！
Georgiana!

739
01:26:15,067 --> 01:26:17,900
放开我！
Unhand me!

740
01:26:18,003 --> 01:26:19,300
乔治安娜！
Georgiana!

741
01:26:23,075 --> 01:26:26,943
乔治安娜！你能不能放手？
Georgiana! Will you please unhand me?

742
01:26:27,046 --> 01:26:28,377
请原谅
Excuse me.

743
01:26:35,554 --> 01:26:38,114
乔治安娜！求求你
Georgiana! Please.

744
01:26:39,825 --> 01:26:41,156
乔治安娜！
Georgiana!

745
01:26:42,728 --> 01:26:45,196
- 谢谢，伯利 - 放开他
- Thank you, Burleigh. - Let him go.

746
01:26:47,032 --> 01:26:52,732
我每天写十几封信，可你一封都没回
I have written a dozen times a day. Still, there is nothing from you.

747
01:26:52,838 --> 01:26:56,365
出什么事了？难道你不再爱我了？
What has happened? Do you love me no longer?

748
01:26:57,843 --> 01:27:02,280
- 我对你的感觉没有改变 - 那我们就应该在一起
- My personal feelings remain unaltered. - Then we must be together again.

749
01:27:02,381 --> 01:27:04,975
我要娶你，要你为我生儿育女
I want to marry you. I want you to bear my children.

750
01:27:05,084 --> 01:27:06,779
生的是男还是女，我不在乎！
And I don't care if they're boys or girls!

751
01:27:06,885 --> 01:27:10,286
- 要能像你说的就好了 - 当然能，一定会的
- I wish it could be that way. - It can. It will.

752
01:27:11,523 --> 01:27:13,548
这一路总会有艰难苦痛
Sorrows will come however we try to avoid them.

753
01:27:13,659 --> 01:27:15,889
我们必须坚持到底，决不让步
We must stay the course and never give in.

754
01:27:15,995 --> 01:27:18,759
- 不，查尔斯 - 离开这儿，跟我走
- No, Charles. - You must leave and be with me.

755
01:27:18,864 --> 01:27:21,025
做个自由的女人，走吧！我们现在就走！
A free woman. Now! Let us leave now!

756
01:27:21,133 --> 01:27:23,863
我不能丢下我的孩子
I cannot abandon my children.

757
01:27:27,139 --> 01:27:29,835
自己好好想想，你刚才叫我做的事
Listen to what you are asking me to do.

758
01:28:22,995 --> 01:28:26,487
怎么了？这鸽子不对你的口味？
What's the matter? Don't like the pigeon?

759
01:28:28,867 --> 01:28:30,732
我觉得还满好吃的
I find it quite decent.

760
01:28:38,410 --> 01:28:41,072
我肚里怀着查尔斯・格雷的孩子
I'm carrying Charles Grey's child.

761
01:28:54,393 --> 01:28:57,988
请把我的决定告诉公爵夫人
Please be so kind as to inform the Duchess of my decision.

762
01:29:00,032 --> 01:29:02,262
事情安排如下
This is how it will be.

763
01:29:02,367 --> 01:29:06,303
你会被带到乡下，在那儿生下孩子
You will be taken to the country where you will give birth to the child,

764
01:29:06,405 --> 01:29:10,501
孩子将交给查尔斯・格雷的家人 由其抚养
and the child will be trusted to the care of Charles Grey's family.

765
01:29:14,646 --> 01:29:16,307
你听见了吗？
Are you listening?

766
01:29:17,316 --> 01:29:19,307
她应该都听到了，我们走吧
I think she's heard you. Let's leave her.

767
01:29:19,418 --> 01:29:21,409
- 乔治安娜，回答我 - 我说了，我们走
- Georgiana, please. - I said let's leave.

768
01:29:21,553 --> 01:29:23,953
这不是商量，我的决定她已经知道了
This is not a discussion. She's been informed of my decision.

769
01:29:24,056 --> 01:29:26,024
- 给她一点同情吧，威廉 - 要什么同情啊
- Have pity on her, William. - Pity be damned.

770
01:29:26,125 --> 01:29:28,457
你也清楚，这是她自找的
She's brought this upon herself, as well you know.

771
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:31,552
- 走吧 - 不，我和她一起去
- Now come. - No. I will go with her.

772
01:29:32,664 --> 01:29:34,222
你哪儿也不准去
But you're not going anywhere.

773
01:29:34,333 --> 01:29:36,028
如果乔要我去，我就跟她走
I will go with G, if G will have me,

774
01:29:36,135 --> 01:29:39,935
你说什么做什么都没用，阻拦不了我们
and there's nothing you can do or say to stop either of us.

775
01:30:33,392 --> 01:30:36,987
- 谢谢你来陪我 - 我一定得陪在你身边
- Thank you for coming. - I couldn't not be with you.

776
01:31:14,566 --> 01:31:15,931
该动身了
It's time.

777
01:31:20,239 --> 01:31:22,867
- 要不要… - 不用，我来抱她
- Would it help... - No, I must take her.

778
01:32:46,291 --> 01:32:49,590
夫人，我是格雷将军
Your Grace, I'm General Grey.

779
01:32:52,464 --> 01:32:54,022
查尔斯在哪儿？
Where's Charles?

780
01:32:54,933 --> 01:32:58,198
你丈夫觉得这事最好由我出面
Your husband thought it best if I took care of this.

781
01:33:35,974 --> 01:33:37,464
格雷将军
General Grey.

782
