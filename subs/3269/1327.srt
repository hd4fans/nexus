1
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:26,208
Name is aword by which a person is spoken of.

2
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:28,042
When a person's profession

3
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:30,167
becomes his nick name£¬

4
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:33,292
people will forget his original name.

5
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:35,042
My nick-name is the King of Adventurers.

6
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,042
I am a novel writer and an adventurer.

7
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:41,875
My student and I lost our way during an adventure.

8
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:44,458
We walked three days and nights in adesert.

9
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:46,000
We hadn't drunk any drop of water.

10
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,708
Although we were very tired£¬

11
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:49,583
we hadn't gone asleep.

12
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:51,667
On the third day£¬we were almost exhaused£¬

13
00:01:51,917 --> 00:01:53,375
we saw one thing.

14
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:18,250
Who are you?

15
00:02:19,417 --> 00:02:21,583
- What are you moving?
- Move harder!

16
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:23,292
What's that?

17
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,458
Can you answer my question?

18
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:26,583
I am not responsible for answering questions.

19
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,542
Who can answer me then?

20
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:28,958
The one who is inside the ox.

21
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,917
He is studying the stomach of the ox

22
00:02:34,917 --> 00:02:36,708
Is there anybody inside the ox?

23
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:40,417
What kind of ox?

24
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:43,250
This is a golden ox! It's hard to get one.

25
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:46,375
Golden ox? It's dark in color!

26
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,792
Move away! Don't block my way!

27
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:50,542
Go!

28
00:02:51,917 --> 00:02:53,333
He doesn't know this is a preciousantique!

29
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:02,417
Accident happens!

30
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:04,833
What kind of accident?

31
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,167
Help!

32
00:03:20,292 --> 00:03:23,333
It's running over us!

33
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,458
Get lost! Be careful£¬
the golden ox is Iosing control.

34
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:26,708
Run! Escape!

35
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:27,875
Don't hurt anyone£¬it's dangerous.

36
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:28,958
Get up!

37
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,333
You always dream of gold!

38
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:33,833
I have just fallen asleep!

39
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,208
I told you not to go to karaoke that often.

40
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,042
Which new song is named Golden Ox?

41
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,792
You are not like me£¬
I only need to sleep three hours a day.

42
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,125
You are so young but you are so weak!

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,083
Yeah£¬ like you! Sleep only three hours a day!

44
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:47,667
Look at you!

45
00:03:48,292 --> 00:03:49,667
You are so ugly looking.

46
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:51,792
The article is ready.

47
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,500
The Idea Box is empty.

48
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,333
Can't think anything?

49
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,042
You know.

50
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,542
Love problem again?

51
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,458
Monica again?

52
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,667
Affection is like an apple.

53
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,292
No matter how tasty is it£¬

54
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,208
you have to shit at last.

55
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,375
Eat another one!

56
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,125
I do hope so.

57
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,833
What a shit is£¬ like Adam£¬
one apple has already given me too much trouble.

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,333
How dare I eat another one?

59
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:24,708
I hate eating apple.

60
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,708
What a waste! You haven't bitted.

61
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:35,042
It's good to eat more apples£¬ remember!

62
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,208
Mr Chow£¬ the boss is looking for you.

63
00:04:40,917 --> 00:04:42,083
What for?

64
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,375
He comes back that early!

65
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,417
Just go on typing your articles!

66
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,083
I've finished!

67
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,083
So what?

68
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,000
- Chow Si-kit!
- I know

69
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:54,250
What do you know?

70
00:04:54,417 --> 00:04:56,250
93 stories of the novel
"King of Adventurers" have been issued.

71
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:57,583
Still 7 stories have not yet been written.

72
00:04:58,292 --> 00:04:59,042
I am glad you know it.

73
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,375
I know.

74
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:02,292
What else do you know?

75
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:03,667
We can't catch the publishing schedule againl

76
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,042
According to our contract£¬
we will publish 100 stories a year.

77
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,250
Now£¬ three months has passed.

78
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,333
- Then...
- I know!

79
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,042
You know everything£¬
so should I keep my mouth shut?

80
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,667
You know? I have great loss!

81
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,917
I know you are having great loss.

82
00:05:17,042 --> 00:05:18,083
I know.

83
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:22,417
Kit£¬ you can't do anything to amend
the relationship between you and Monica.

84
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:25,708
How can your career be affected?

85
00:05:25,917 --> 00:05:28,083
For a man£¬ career is his life.

86
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,417
Doesn't it worth for a woman like this?

87
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:33,000
Mr Lo£¬ your call£¬ it's from Monica.

88
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:38,292
Hi£¬ Monica£¬ did you have a sound sleep?

89
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:39,500
Have you eaten the medicine

90
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:41,000
which I introduced to you?

91
00:05:41,167 --> 00:05:42,458
Should I go out first?

92
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:46,042
I am just chatting with your hubby.

93
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:47,542
I love to talk to you instead.

94
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,333
I am his employer only!

95
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,000
We are different£¬ we are friends.

96
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:53,958
So£¬ we can talk something affectionate.

97
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,625
You are flattering me.

98
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,000
In fact£¬ there is difference.

99
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,458
How bad is the contract.

100
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,125
Mr Chow£¬ you should learn from Headmaster.

101
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,583
After saying goodbye to his wife£¬
he remarried in Mainland China

102
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,083
A Philipino maid cheated all him money.

103
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,250
Later£¬ he knew a girlfriend£¬

104
00:06:13,417 --> 00:06:14,792
he promised to pay her debt to loan sharks.

105
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,833
But£¬ she brushed him off.

106
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:18,292
He then went to bar to court girls.

107
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:19,792
But£¬it was a stool pigeon.

108
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:23,083
Now£¬ he owes others much money! What a poor guy.

109
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,083
But he keeps on writing!

110
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,375
He writes in the Ieft£¬ in the toilet£¬

111
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,583
by left hand£¬ and then right hand!

112
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,875
He never stops!

113
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,708
In fact£¬ the torture of life
is the food of a creator.

114
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,833
Monica is giving you money!

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,500
Sorry£¬ I don't need such kind of money!

116
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:37,958
It breaks my heart.

117
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:39,375
I am not that lucky to spend such kind of money!

118
00:06:40,542 --> 00:06:41,542
Chow Si-kit.

119
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,833
Monica dated you to have a meeting
tonight to talk about the divorce.

120
00:06:47,917 --> 00:06:49,500
Keep an eye on him£¬or he will fight.

121
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:50,792
OK£¬ I will follow him.

122
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,375
Where?

123
00:07:03,542 --> 00:07:05,875
By the way£¬I won't divorce.

124
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,417
What do you want?

125
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,042
Just pretend nothing has happened.

126
00:07:10,417 --> 00:07:11,542
Impossible!

127
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,625
I know I don't know how to please you.

128
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,417
When you knew me£¬ you knew this very well.

129
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:19,083
I can't pretend as another guy.

130
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:21,083
Right£¬ you can't pretend as another one.

131
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:23,042
Please be straight to the point.

132
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:27,500
I am too straight forward£¬

133
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:29,917
But you are even worse than me.

134
00:07:30,292 --> 00:07:32,708
Since we don't have babies£¬
it'll be wise for us to separate.

135
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,417
You are so selfish!

136
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,542
We work from day and night.

137
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,333
We need to work over night sometimes.

138
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,917
You too!

139
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:43,708
You can't blame me only.

140
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,333
Not exactly!

141
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,000
- Hi.
- Monica

142
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,208
Movie star.

143
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,208
You like such kind of playboy?

144
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,750
Monica wants a divorce£¬
this is Mr Chan£¬ the lawyer.

145
00:08:00,042 --> 00:08:01,083
He is an expert in divorce malter.

146
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,292
How are you£¬ Mr Chow?

147
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:04,750
I wrote the paper for Monica.

148
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,083
Please take a look.

149
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,292
You love such kind of greasy guy?

150
00:08:12,417 --> 00:08:14,292
In fact£¬ l like your style£¬ with wisdom.

151
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,917
But you don't like me.

152
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,417
Are you learning from me£¬
or do you want to court me?

153
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:22,000
I bet both sides£¬ any outcome will be fine to me.

154
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,792
You can't make money by gambling£¬ yoo know?

155
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,208
Otherwise£¬ the Royal Jocky Club
won't be that sinful£¬

156
00:08:27,792 --> 00:08:29,583
that's why they do so many charity deeds.

157
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:34,125
What's so funny?

158
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,625
I don't have money to pay you.

159
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:39,375
Lawyer fee?

160
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:43,708
Don't worry£¬ I'll introduce
you to write TV script.

161
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,042
You can earn much more than writing novels.

162
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,167
Since the audiences love watching stars only.

163
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,333
My divorce is none of your business.

164
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,708
Monica helps me to invest£¬

165
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,542
her business is my business too.

166
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,042
Her divorce is my business too!

167
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,708
Don't mix up divorce with stocks.

168
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,375
Think it over£¬ Iam Ieaving now.

169
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,500
Monica£¬ you haven't eaten yet.

170
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:07,750
I will have some food with you.

171
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:16,542
Waiter£¬ give me a bottle of volka.

172
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,792
Chung Fat-pai!

173
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:25,833
I won in one mahjong game once£¬
why do you still mention it?

174
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,625
Please help£¬ we will drop him here and leave.

175
00:09:27,792 --> 00:09:28,833
Don't close the door please.

176
00:09:29,542 --> 00:09:31,333
Please let him spend one night here.

177
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:33,917
Hurry up!

178
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:35,542
No problem£¬ it'll be quick!

179
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,375
It's poor to be a man like this!

180
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:42,583
What's that?

181
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,792
Idea Box.

182
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:46,542
But nothing is found inside.

183
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,208
Usually£¬ he puts his ideas there.

184
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,667
But now£¬ they are all gone£¬
so he doesn't know how to write the story!

185
00:09:50,042 --> 00:09:51,208
So poor!

186
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:54,750
- Let me try.
- How?

187
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,542
The box is the key point of it.

188
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,375
Since there isn't anything inside!

189
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:00,875
What does that mean?

190
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,458
Let's find out the ideas for him.

191
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:05,750
Come on.

192
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:07,875
Do you know where he ends in the last story?

193
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:09,375
Yes£¬ I do.

194
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:14,042
In the last story£¬

195
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,167
the golden ox lost control.

196
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:17,708
Right at such critical moment.

197
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,458
Smart and handsome

198
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:21,625
King of Adventurers appears.

199
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,000
Look£¬ he is so smart Iooking!

200
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:27,708
Master.

201
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,625
You've finally shown up.

202
00:10:29,917 --> 00:10:32,208
- Shing
- He goes crazy.

203
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,125
He uses the golden ox to run people over.

204
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:35,958
Don't panic!

205
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,750
Thank you¡­

206
00:11:31,292 --> 00:11:33,042
You ruined my ox£¬ you are in deep shit now!

207
00:11:34,042 --> 00:11:35,792
Look£¬ you're in great trouble too.

208
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,292
Why don't you tie them up?

209
00:11:40,792 --> 00:11:43,125
You fools solved the danger
cause by the golden ox.

210
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,458
The Kingg of Adventurers intended
to have a lunch with his student.

211
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:49,333
Right at that moment.

212
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,208
The lunch had already been arranged.

213
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,792
King of Adventurers£¬
the Security Consultant General Lone£¬

214
00:11:55,042 --> 00:11:57,500
wants to meet you in his office.

215
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:00,333
General Lone?

216
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,333
Isn't he Uncle Lone?

217
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:05,833
You know the answer already.

218
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,833
He is a high official now£¬ isn't he?

219
00:12:11,042 --> 00:12:12,625
So£¬ you can't despise anyone.

220
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,750
This lunch must be very important.

221
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,833
Have biscuit.

222
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,750
Uncle Lone has a best salary£¬
your life is more simple

223
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,292
My salary hasn't been paid yet£¬
please be considerate.

224
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:29,917
I asked you to come here for the
scripture of no words and its box.

225
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,833
You are an adventurer and an archaeologist£¬

226
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,708
expert in finding the lost antiques.

227
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,708
we hope you'd bring back
the scripture &its packing box.

228
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,250
What scripture and box?
Why do you need my master's help?

229
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:43,458
We learn this scripture and
its box from a mysterious legend.

230
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:44,708
The scripture with no words

231
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,208
is related to the future of people.

232
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,208
The box is the key to find the scripture.

233
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,625
It's known that£¬ the last appearance
of it was in the end of Ching Dynasty.

234
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:57,375
The boss of the Salt Gang
got it from lamas of Tibet£¬

235
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:00,542
It' s said£¬ because of the massacre£¬

236
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,333
the sand turned red within half mile.

237
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:05,542
I admire you so much!

238
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,583
Now£¬ the archaelogists
of Japan found a letter in agrave£¬

239
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,542
it's believed that by which
we can find out the box.

240
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,792
Where is the letter now?

241
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,042
It's kept inside the safe

242
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:17,083
of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai.

243
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,042
So£¬ we are going to be spy.

244
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,708
Lone said the lelter is
inside the Japanese Embassy.

245
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:32,042
Why should we come to a club?

246
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:35,125
Nut! Isn't the embassy your home?

247
00:13:35,292 --> 00:13:36,125
How can you search as you want?

248
00:13:36,292 --> 00:13:37,542
We have to find away to get in.

249
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:42,917
King of Adventurer knows very well that£¬

250
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,125
the only one who can go
freely to the Japanese Embassy£¬

251
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:47,958
is a guy called Chung Fat-pai£¬

252
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,333
the Japanese gives him face£¬

253
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,958
for he is a famous triad head
who loves wine so much!

254
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,292
Chung Fat-pai.

255
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,917
I won in a mahjong game£¬
why do you still mention it?

256
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,000
I can tell he is avery important person.

257
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:04,958
Such kind of place is heavily guarded!

258
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,958
Do you want to drink with me?

259
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,458
If not£¬forget it.

260
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,667
Come on£¬ bring all good wine here for us.

261
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,292
Are you scared?

262
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,000
I am training my fellows.

263
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:21,250
You know my background!
I don't want to forget my past.

264
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,542
I want you to do one thing for me.

265
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:24,708
OK.

266
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:28,375
To steal a letter from the Japanese Embassy.

267
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,125
What kind of letter is it?

268
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,375
I know they have invited you to a party.

269
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:34,375
Can you bring us along with you?

270
00:14:34,542 --> 00:14:37,167
Sure! But let's drink first.

271
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:47,167
King of Adventurers wants

272
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,917
Chung to help him sneak into the Embassy.

273
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,625
He intends to cut the electricity£¬

274
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:52,083
and steals the letter in the dark.

275
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:54,083
So no one will know who is the thief.

276
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,750
What a wonderful idea!

277
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,333
What a scene!

278
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,125
I haven't smelt such strong perfume.

279
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:01,042
Without it£¬ it's hard to disguise as a woman!

280
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:03,167
Can we go in like this?

281
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,917
By the way£¬ just copy me.

282
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,792
Don't seduce anyone.

283
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,208
I would beat whoever courts me.

284
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,958
This is Mr Chan£¬ a banker in Shanghai.

285
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,083
How are you?

286
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,333
How do you do?

287
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:23,583
This is my wife£¬ my 1st concubine.

288
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:25,750
4th£¬ 5th£¬ 6th£¬ 7th£¬ 8th£¬ and 9th concubine.

289
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,375
Check where the switch room is.

290
00:15:37,542 --> 00:15:38,958
After cutting the electricity£¬
we would act accordingly.

291
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:41,833
Have one£¬ it's great.

292
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,375
So many food!

293
00:15:43,917 --> 00:15:45,250
- Oh! Beautiful lady.
- Hi

294
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:46,542
May I have a dance with you?

295
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:47,500
I am married.

296
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:50,292
- Oh£¬ sorry.
- You had it coming

297
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:53,542
Don't go too far from me£¬ keep contact.

298
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,250
One after another! So mean are they!

299
00:15:56,417 --> 00:15:57,708
Don't just care of drinking£¬
come and dance with me.

300
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,708
I want to have a drink too.

301
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:08,583
Pal£¬ where is the main switch?

302
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,333
I beg your pardon.

303
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:11,750
Pardon?

304
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:17,625
Pal£¬ do you know where is the main switch?

305
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,958
It should be in the switch room.

306
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:24,292
Switch room.

307
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,083
Keep an eye on him.

308
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,917
Can I take you home tonight?

309
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:48,958
That guy gets drunk.

310
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,833
He must have partners£¬ come with me.

311
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,542
My perfume is over because of his strong breath!

312
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,292
- Tow him aside.
- Alright

313
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:03,125
Kiss£¬ baby!

314
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,500
so many people are watching the switch room.

315
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:18,000
- Since we are so happy...
- What'lI we do?

316
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,292
Get some ice to cooI down first.

317
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:33,667
Stay!

318
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:37,292
Miss...You are seen!

319
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,833
Here.

320
00:17:45,042 --> 00:17:46,042
Let me help you!

321
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,042
King of Adventurers has never imagined!

322
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,167
In this party£¬ he would meet a woman£¬

323
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,042
who makes a hero

324
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,458
lose his mind!

325
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:59,750
He knows£¬ his freezed heart is going to melt.

326
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,833
Fire! Tum off the switch!

327
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,667
- It's really dark
- Bullshit

328
00:18:16,167 --> 00:18:16,958
It's perfect!

329
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,625
Keep on playing music£¬ let's dance in the dark.

330
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,083
This is the study room£¬ the letter will be right here.

331
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,042
Old practice£¬ I am looking for the letter£¬
and you£¬ get a way out.

332
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,708
Clean up£¬ don't leave any clues behind.

333
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,917
It's you!

334
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,375
Sorry to wet you.

335
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,250
I want to go to toilet£¬
but I have gone a wrong way.

336
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:21,792
Now£¬ I am going out£¬ don't be surprise!

337
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:23,917
No...

338
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,458
you¡­ were a woman!

339
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,458
This is my hobby!

340
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,083
Sometimes a man£¬sometimes a woman.

341
00:19:31,917 --> 00:19:33,500
How about you? Do you have such habit?

342
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,167
No£¬ I am a woman£¬ I need not pretend as a woman.

343
00:19:36,917 --> 00:19:38,333
I know£¬

344
00:19:38,792 --> 00:19:41,792
you are a very attractive woman!

345
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,167
I love seeing you dress like a man.

346
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:45,667
Wholeheartedly?

347
00:19:46,292 --> 00:19:47,708
Yes£¬ wholeheartedly.

348
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:49,625
Two guests are knocked out!

349
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:52,625
The music stops.

350
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:54,583
- Go and search separately.
- Yes

351
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:57,500
Don't wander off.

352
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:00,958
Stop hiding!

353
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,583
Your prefume is so horrible!

354
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:03,792
I know you are here!

355
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:06,292
Hi£¬ I won't put on perfume next time.

356
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:07,417
Still next time?

357
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,500
Dong! The first round is over.

358
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:23,833
Catch him!

359
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,750
You know how wonderful is my Lightning Fists?

360
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:57,375
Are you alright?

361
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,917
It trembles a lot!

362
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,833
But it helps digestion.

363
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:03,958
What a sharp tongue!

364
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,208
Alright£¬ once more.

365
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:09,875
Hit the waist£¬ hit the neck.

366
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:10,542
Hit the right foot£¬ hit the left foot.

367
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,042
Hit the stomach£¬ hit your temple

368
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:12,917
Hit your heart!

369
00:21:14,417 --> 00:21:15,833
Save it£¬ just talk to my gun.

370
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,833
Talk to my pen.

371
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,542
Don't come over.

372
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,917
If only I move my pen£¬

373
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,917
the gun will talk to him.

374
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:31,542
Drop the gun!

375
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:37,833
My autograph!

376
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:44,417
King of Adventurers?

377
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:49,917
I'll remember you!

378
00:21:59,667 --> 00:22:02,083
Miss Cammy£¬ remember my name£¬ King of Adventurers£¬

379
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,625
Cheer up£¬ since the remaining time of your life£¬

380
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:07,417
will be linked with mine£¬ yours sincerely£¬
King of Adventurers.

381
00:22:08,167 --> 00:22:10,417
From that moment£¬ she watched him
jumping through the window£¬

382
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:14,083
in fact£¬ he has entered her heart.

383
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:16,542
King of Adventurers and Shing went away like wind£¬

384
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,917
and that moved her heart!

385
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:22,458
So£¬ she decided to stay with
the King of Adventurers for her life?

386
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:26,958
Kidding! How come the woman will be so nice to me?

387
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,000
Don't create danger for me.

388
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:30,625
This woman should act like this.

389
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:41,625
I thought you would stay here tonight.

390
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:43,083
Can you say something nice?

391
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:49,958
Are you crazy? You hit me at short range

392
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:51,708
I'm sorry£¬ General

393
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,042
Go to check the letter quickly.

394
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,667
Cammy whom King of Adventurers saw that night...

395
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:00,625
was a hard hearted

396
00:23:00,792 --> 00:23:02,292
woman instead.

397
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,667
No one could imagine that£¬

398
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:06,208
she is a beautiful but dangerous woman£¬
like poisonous candy.

399
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:08,292
In Shanghai£¬

400
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:10,083
she operated a clubhouse for killings.

401
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:12,542
This merciless evil bitch!

402
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:14,208
She uses men as experiment.

403
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:23,458
You were fat when you came
why are you so thin now?

404
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:24,542
Are you taking drugs?

405
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:28,083
No£¬ but I got thin because
you took me as an experiment.

406
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,083
So£¬ you are useless now.

407
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,333
You'd better go to hell.

408
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:32,083
Get ready the gas.

409
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:35,125
No!

410
00:23:52,417 --> 00:23:53,667
I don't want him to die that soon.

411
00:23:53,917 --> 00:23:55,042
I haven't given him enough torture!

412
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,208
You slept with him£¬
that's why you are merciful now?

413
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,333
You are wrong.

414
00:24:00,167 --> 00:24:02,542
I want to test the capacity

415
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:03,958
of human body.

416
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:07,625
And I want to test how strong one's mind will be.

417
00:24:08,542 --> 00:24:10,042
Why do you use man?

418
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:11,542
Since Iam a woman.

419
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:14,667
I have no reason to let you know my weakness.

420
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:17,875
- There are many kinds of men.
- I think you have no say here.

421
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,417
I am a man too!

422
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,875
Our target

423
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:24,625
should be a self confident man.

424
00:24:24,917 --> 00:24:27,292
That's hero!

425
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:29,875
I am self confident too.

426
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:31,708
I mean King of Adventurers.

427
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,542
Only the one who is over confident
would keep on adventuring.

428
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:37,208
And we can kill our enemy at the same time.

429
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:40,292
What a good idea!

430
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:42,250
I am now asking you to get him back.

431
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,833
I am no match for him.

432
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:45,250
Just bull shit!

433
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,458
First£¬ kill his friend General Lone.

434
00:24:52,667 --> 00:24:55,250
He left Xian by train yesterday.

435
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,583
He will arrive Shanghai this day.

436
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:01,083
The letter was stolen two days ago in our Embassy.

437
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,208
If it is taken by the King of Adventurers£¬

438
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,208
it's possible that he would
give this letter to Lone by hand.

439
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:13,125
Over there.

440
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:17,542
Miss Cammy£¬ you are damn right.

441
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:19,417
Don't use poisonous gas.

442
00:25:19,708 --> 00:25:21,542
I want to keep his life for another experiment.

443
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:23,083
If you don't kill him now£¬

444
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,542
I am afraid you would miss a chance.

445
00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:25,750
Yourjob is to carry out the mission.

446
00:25:25,917 --> 00:25:27,208
Why do you raise so many questions?

447
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:51,542
General Lone is in danger.

448
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:57,917
When the woman was killing General Lone£¬

449
00:25:58,125 --> 00:26:00,333
in fact£¬ she was breaking
the heart of the King of Adventurers£¬

450
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:02,500
but this hard hearted woman£¬

451
00:26:02,667 --> 00:26:03,875
after killing General Lone£¬

452
00:26:04,542 --> 00:26:06,958
there is another evil thought in her mind.

453
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,375
In this world£¬

454
00:26:08,542 --> 00:26:10,583
no one can estimate¡­

455
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,083
what damages will be caused by this woman.

456
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:14,625
- Smoke?
- This is the correct way to write.

457
00:26:14,792 --> 00:26:16,583
- Now start.
- This woman!

458
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:17,500
She left without saying a word.

459
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:19,125
- You have to write in this way.
- Chow Si-kit!

460
00:26:19,292 --> 00:26:21,708
You can't ruin such romantic love like this!

461
00:26:22,167 --> 00:26:23,333
How romantic?

462
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:25,000
I have been tortured like
shit by the woman inside£¬

463
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,292
how can I write romantic things?

464
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:28,083
You don't understand woman at all.

465
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:31,583
Don't I? I have married
with this woman for two years£¬

466
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,458
what have I got?

467
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:34,625
Self abase£¬ and I lost all my confidence!

468
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:36,208
I can't even work!

469
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:38,042
How can I trust woman?

470
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:41,042
I haven't known that women
are so troublesome indeed!

471
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:42,583
Right! It's shit!

472
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:49,833
You need not to be self abased.

473
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:51,708
This is the key of your home.

474
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:53,583
I've moved out.

475
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:54,500
Check your belongings.

476
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:56,667
Or£¬ don't blame me of lossing anything in future.

477
00:26:58,875 --> 00:26:59,958
Isn't this key useless?

478
00:27:00,417 --> 00:27:01,875
Change the lock quickly.

479
00:27:02,042 --> 00:27:03,792
So£¬ you won't suspect me of copying it.

480
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,042
You have never trusted a woman.

481
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,375
Monica

482
00:27:13,292 --> 00:27:13,917
Monica! What are you laughing at?

483
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:15,000
Isn't it funny?

484
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:19,375
What are you laughing? Monica!

485
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:23,000
Monica

486
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:26,083
What do you want?

487
00:27:26,292 --> 00:27:27,667
You just release yourself by writing!

488
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:28,542
You are chicken!

489
00:27:28,708 --> 00:27:29,750
But you become a hero in your novel!

490
00:27:29,917 --> 00:27:31,083
Are you a man?

491
00:27:31,708 --> 00:27:33,917
Wonderful! Mrs Chow£¬ you are great.

492
00:27:35,208 --> 00:27:37,250
How can you clap?

493
00:27:37,542 --> 00:27:38,917
Am I a rat? Who are you then?

494
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:40,917
You bitchy woman! You always seduce men!

495
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:41,792
We are separated!

496
00:27:41,958 --> 00:27:43,167
I give you face so I keep my mouth shut.

497
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:44,458
If I don't give you face¡­

498
00:27:45,042 --> 00:27:46,333
So what?

499
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:48,792
If I don't£¬ I will give you a slap.

500
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:51,333
The lift is coming£¬
if you want to slap me£¬ be quick.

501
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,625
Beat her¡­

502
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,083
Just go ahead.

503
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,417
It's a great slap.

504
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,667
You slap the air only!

505
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:20,167
Isn't it funny? Why don't you go home
and slap your own wife?

506
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:21,333
Enjoy your time!

507
00:28:27,167 --> 00:28:28,417
There is a lift accident!

508
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:32,583
Which lift?

509
00:28:42,542 --> 00:28:44,042
Monica...

510
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:45,292
Send her to the hospital!

511
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:50,042
Where is your damn car? Where is it parked?

512
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:52,208
Hurry up!

513
00:28:54,708 --> 00:28:55,625
Give me the key.

514
00:29:01,167 --> 00:29:02,167
Does he know driving?

515
00:29:02,542 --> 00:29:02,875
Yes.

516
00:29:03,042 --> 00:29:04,167
Motorcycle.

517
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:20,750
Do you want him to pay for the loss?

518
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:31,917
Save that woman first.

519
00:29:38,917 --> 00:29:40,458
Their love has a U turn!

520
00:29:44,042 --> 00:29:45,542
Are you talking about the novel?

521
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:46,500
Both!

522
00:29:46,792 --> 00:29:48,167
Actually£¬

523
00:29:49,042 --> 00:29:50,750
King of Adventurers misunderstood that woman!

524
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:53,167
Cammy is poor instead.

525
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,875
Get ready the poisonous gas.

526
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,333
Cammy is down there.

527
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,875
I won't allow any chance for them to fall in love.

528
00:29:59,375 --> 00:30:00,292
Yes.

529
00:30:02,417 --> 00:30:05,375
Run¡­

530
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:30,208
He is holding a woman£¬
how can he run faster than us?

531
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:31,083
He will be dead meat this lime!

532
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:32,833
- After them!
- Yes

533
00:30:45,792 --> 00:30:46,583
You'd better drive.

534
00:30:50,542 --> 00:30:51,958
Don't let them escape.

535
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,125
There is no way out.

536
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:16,333
Shit! I don't know how to drive a train.

537
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,375
Which button to stop?

538
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:20,458
According to my information£¬
you don't even know how to drive!

539
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:25,583
Move! I don't know how to drive a train!

540
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,792
Shit!

541
00:31:27,958 --> 00:31:29,500
Which button can stop the train?

542
00:31:47,667 --> 00:31:48,667
Why do you save me?

543
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,333
I am the person who wants to ruin your mind.

544
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,750
You just want to ruin my mind.

545
00:31:51,917 --> 00:31:53,083
But I am ruining many things now! It's tense.

546
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,417
But I want you to know that£¬

547
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:58,542
no matter how dangerous out there¡­

548
00:32:00,417 --> 00:32:03,250
I care you most!

549
00:32:04,167 --> 00:32:05,250
You are so silly!

550
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:08,208
But I always want you to care about me.

551
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:10,208
Do you know you are selfish to do like this?

552
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:14,042
Sorry£¬ love is always selfish!

553
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:15,708
Forgive me.

554
00:32:26,792 --> 00:32:28,458
Cammy¡­

555
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:41,708
Miss Monica£¬

556
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:43,667
although you got shock inside the lift£¬

557
00:32:43,958 --> 00:32:47,125
you are alright£¬
you can leave after taking a rest.

558
00:32:48,042 --> 00:32:49,208
Take it to Mr Chow's room?

559
00:32:49,583 --> 00:32:51,708
Yes£¬ I intend to finish the story for MrChow.

560
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:53,917
Mr Chow and his wife are so funny!

561
00:32:54,292 --> 00:32:56,208
He sent her in the hospital£¬

562
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:58,417
but he doesn't allow us to tell his wife the fact.

563
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:00,125
They are having a little argue.

564
00:33:00,292 --> 00:33:01,208
Isn't it funny?

565
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:02,292
This is romance!

566
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:09,417
Monica...

567
00:33:12,417 --> 00:33:13,583
Yvonne?

568
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:49,458
Get up£¬ get up now.

569
00:33:50,292 --> 00:33:51,250
Get Shing back now.

570
00:33:51,417 --> 00:33:52,167
Has he come?

571
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:54,250
Yes.he is still in the corridor£¬ hurryup!

572
00:33:57,208 --> 00:33:58,333
Why do you leave so quickly?

573
00:33:58,917 --> 00:34:00,167
Have I come? Nuts!

574
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:02,125
Haven't you? So£¬ why is there a computer?

575
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:04,625
Why don't you ask the computer? Go now!

576
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:06,417
Why do you lose your temper?

577
00:34:07,167 --> 00:34:08,333
You looked ugly£¬

578
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,292
and now£¬ you are more ugly£¬ understand?

579
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:11,875
I hate ugly people.

580
00:34:12,167 --> 00:34:14,208
Can you let me have some love imaginations?

581
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:15,583
You'd better go to Mr Chow.

582
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:21,167
He is jealousing.

583
00:34:23,125 --> 00:34:24,417
Shing's left.Why do you laugh?

584
00:34:25,167 --> 00:34:26,375
Hey£¬ Shing!

585
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,792
I know how to write the remaining stories
of the King of Adventurers£¬

586
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:31,167
Yvonne£¬ mark it down for me.

587
00:34:31,875 --> 00:34:33,708
Shing£¬ type as much as I tell you.

588
00:34:34,667 --> 00:34:36,583
Let's finish the story

589
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:38,375
as soon as possible!

590
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,833
Although General Lone died£¬

591
00:34:42,667 --> 00:34:44,542
King of Adventurers and Shing

592
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,875
kept on finding out the whereabout of the box.

593
00:34:47,583 --> 00:34:49,333
They could depend on no one¡­

594
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,667
...but themselves.

595
00:34:51,792 --> 00:34:53,000
Why haven't you put on your glasses?

596
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:54,417
I don't want to see anything.

597
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:56,083
Did I break your heart?

598
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:57,792
Did I tell such line?

599
00:34:57,958 --> 00:34:58,792
No such line.

600
00:34:59,042 --> 00:35:00,083
No such line.

601
00:35:01,042 --> 00:35:03,042
According to the letter
which was stolen from the Embassy£¬

602
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,542
two words were written.

603
00:35:04,875 --> 00:35:06,208
Righteous News.

604
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:08,875
So£¬ they finally came to this press office.

605
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:13,000
I think this is the right place!

606
00:35:14,167 --> 00:35:16,792
Pay at once£¬ here is so dangerous!

607
00:35:24,167 --> 00:35:26,292
See the fence!
It doesn't seem to be a press office.

608
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:27,750
Go in and take a look.

609
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,458
The people ahead£¬ get lost.

610
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:35,542
Put out the fire!

611
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:37,750
They are so effective!

612
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:39,083
I think they have offended many people£¬

613
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,542
so they have to be alert.

614
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:42,042
For righteousness£¬ you have to sacrifice.

615
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,375
Can you term it as sacrifice
if you are caught after committing crime?

616
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:44,917
It depends.

617
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:46,917
For righteousness£¬ you won't be alone.

618
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:48,958
Even we are abandoned£¬
it can be claimed as atraining.

619
00:35:49,292 --> 00:35:50,792
More abandonments£¬ more strength you'll have.

620
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:52,250
We have to keep it up.

621
00:35:52,542 --> 00:35:54,625
Not only using one hand£¬ but both hands.

622
00:35:54,792 --> 00:35:56,417
This is the spirit of our newspaper!

623
00:35:56,583 --> 00:35:58,125
Bravo! Headmaster£¬ you are great!

624
00:36:00,542 --> 00:36:01,000
Drag him out£¬

625
00:36:01,167 --> 00:36:02,583
read today's editorial few times to him.

626
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:08,542
I can't imagine that he used
our paper to wrap the knife.

627
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,667
That means£¬ his gang of territorists
is wrapped by us.

628
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:15,792
This proves that£¬ we are affecting them.

629
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:17,167
What a sharp tongue!

630
00:36:21,958 --> 00:36:23,792
We are outsiders£¬ we should not have said so much.

631
00:36:25,292 --> 00:36:26,292
Who are you?

632
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:28,583
We are here to look¡­

633
00:36:28,917 --> 00:36:30,958
To look forjobs.

634
00:36:31,417 --> 00:36:33,667
But I can't even afford buying your clothes
with one month of my salary.

635
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:36,125
That's why I have to give up my previous outlook.

636
00:36:36,292 --> 00:36:37,667
From now on£¬ I come here to enrich myself.

637
00:36:38,542 --> 00:36:39,917
Liar!

638
00:36:40,792 --> 00:36:42,125
How do you know I am lying?

639
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,667
We have enough men power here£¬ you'd better go.

640
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:48,292
He asked us to leave.

641
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:49,583
Well£¬ let's carry out part two.

642
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,458
Who is the in charge here?

643
00:36:53,042 --> 00:36:55,458
I am£¬ what do you want?

644
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:58,500
We Japanese send troops to the North East only£¬

645
00:36:58,667 --> 00:36:59,583
we haven't offended you.

646
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,375
Why do you always scold us through your paper?

647
00:37:01,917 --> 00:37:03,042
You can't say this an offence!

648
00:37:03,208 --> 00:37:05,208
So£¬ we have to thank you
for giving us so many bullets!

649
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:06,667
Now£¬ they are so full
that they need not eat anything!

650
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:11,250
Let them do it.

651
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:12,583
Shanghai isn't your zone! Why are you so fierce?

652
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:15,500
Don't move!

653
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:16,500
You'd better look for me if there is any trouble!

654
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:17,792
We don't want to fight.

655
00:37:17,958 --> 00:37:18,583
I am called Headmaster!

656
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,833
Headmaster?

657
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:21,708
So£¬ you will be in deep shit from now on!

658
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,792
Go.

659
00:37:25,083 --> 00:37:29,292
- Sorry...
- Go!

660
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:31,875
They are good actors!

661
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,917
Pay now£¬ or our secret will be disclosed!

662
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:37,583
Becareful! Don't let others see you paying them!

663
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:39,333
I understand!

664
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,125
That's alright!

665
00:37:43,042 --> 00:37:45,000
Let's call it a day! Return the costumes quickly!

666
00:37:45,542 --> 00:37:46,375
Don't go!

667
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:49,875
You're good at fighting!
Come and fight with me then!

668
00:37:50,042 --> 00:37:51,542
How dare you block our way?

669
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:52,667
Beat her¡­

670
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:58,875
There seems to be an accident!

671
00:37:59,208 --> 00:38:00,958
We don't have enough money
to pay for another fight.

672
00:38:01,333 --> 00:38:02,542
This time£¬ we should pay the overtime charge!

673
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:06,583
Let me help you.

674
00:38:06,792 --> 00:38:08,542
Listen£¬ stop fighting.

675
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:09,875
Or£¬ Iwon't be responsible!

676
00:38:10,042 --> 00:38:10,875
I don't want you to be responsible!

677
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:14,792
Come here for negotiation!

678
00:38:17,875 --> 00:38:19,375
Lislen£¬ be frank!

679
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:20,583
Don't move!

680
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:23,417
This is additional£¬ get half pay£¬ OK?

681
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:26,792
You have done a great job!

682
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:48,833
I will pay you enough over-time fee.

683
00:38:55,042 --> 00:38:56,042
Hurry up!

684
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:58,417
The kicks hurt me.

685
00:38:59,625 --> 00:39:00,750
It's time for me to get advantage!

686
00:39:09,542 --> 00:39:10,958
If you have guts£¬ come tomorrow.

687
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:12,333
I helped you to get rid of them£¬

688
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:13,458
why don't you take a glance at me?

689
00:39:17,417 --> 00:39:19,125
At least you should say thank you.

690
00:39:28,208 --> 00:39:29,292
Isn't it hard to say thank you?

691
00:39:33,542 --> 00:39:35,125
First love will always fail£¬ let's go.

692
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:36,708
How do you know it's my first love?

693
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:37,958
I can tell from your eyes!

694
00:39:38,917 --> 00:39:41,292
How about being a watchman here?

695
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:43,958
- Sure
- Sure!

696
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:47,125
Do they look like watchmen?

697
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:48,917
Better than keeping a dog here!

698
00:40:05,167 --> 00:40:06,000
Master.

699
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:10,458
Master£¬ two strangers came here

700
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:12,667
to be watchmen.

701
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:13,750
Go on.

702
00:40:13,917 --> 00:40:15,417
I don't know their backgrounds.

703
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:17,000
Don't you think...

704
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:18,333
And...

705
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:19,500
Infact¡­

706
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,167
Will they...And¡­In fact they¡­
What do you want to say?

707
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,917
In fact£¬ you needn't mask.

708
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:27,875
Your work is same as the editor's up there.

709
00:40:28,042 --> 00:40:29,042
Why do you be that tough?

710
00:40:29,208 --> 00:40:30,042
You won't understand.

711
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,417
In this world£¬ the mysterious power

712
00:40:31,583 --> 00:40:32,667
will give people hopes!

713
00:40:32,833 --> 00:40:33,833
So£¬ mysterious power.

714
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,292
Are we looking for troubles
to employ that two guys

715
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:36,542
be our watchmen?

716
00:40:37,042 --> 00:40:38,875
They dress well£¬

717
00:40:39,042 --> 00:40:40,250
how come they would be a watchman?

718
00:40:40,417 --> 00:40:41,625
But£¬ I employ them.

719
00:40:41,792 --> 00:40:43,167
is to keep an eye on them.

720
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:44,250
If you kick them away£¬

721
00:40:44,417 --> 00:40:46,000
they may do something behind us!

722
00:40:46,167 --> 00:40:46,958
It sounds reasonable!

723
00:40:47,167 --> 00:40:48,917
Will they come for the box?

724
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:53,417
You are really smart£¬ beautiful and clever!

725
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,500
Enough£¬ it makes me sick!

726
00:40:56,667 --> 00:40:57,792
How does the box look like?

727
00:40:57,958 --> 00:40:58,917
What is inside?

728
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:00,833
I haven't taken any look at it.

729
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,125
Why not open it?

730
00:41:02,292 --> 00:41:05,042
No! We can't open it.

731
00:41:05,542 --> 00:41:07,042
I am a descendant of the Salt Gang.

732
00:41:07,708 --> 00:41:09,917
Our ancestors said...

733
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,292
Hand me the box£¬ then I'll let you go.

734
00:41:15,458 --> 00:41:17,083
Stop dreaming! The box is not yours!

735
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,458
If you open it£¬ there will be great trouble!

736
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:19,917
Lama£¬ cut the crap!

737
00:41:33,792 --> 00:41:35,000
Don't open it!

738
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,500
My dad opened it£¬ thus£¬ he became like this.

739
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:17,083
It'll be shit! We can't open the box.

740
00:42:19,208 --> 00:42:20,208
It's so dangerous!

741
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,667
If you open the box accidentally£¬

742
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:22,917
you will be burnt!

743
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,833
But don't worry£¬

744
00:42:26,625 --> 00:42:29,125
I've put the box in a safe place.

745
00:42:29,792 --> 00:42:31,208
This safe place¡­

746
00:42:31,875 --> 00:42:33,292
is a hole right

747
00:42:33,458 --> 00:42:35,958
behind the compose stands!

748
00:42:36,292 --> 00:42:37,333
It's safe£¬

749
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:40,417
no one is so smart to find out that hole!

750
00:42:40,667 --> 00:42:43,583
By the way£¬ that is a difficult place to find!

751
00:42:47,083 --> 00:42:48,333
That's the stand I mentioned!

752
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:51,833
Go and take a look!

753
00:42:57,042 --> 00:42:59,583
It's strange! Why there is a hole?

754
00:42:59,958 --> 00:43:01,792
Any snake or insects climbed in?

755
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:05,750
Luckily the box is still there!

756
00:43:11,583 --> 00:43:12,750
There is a dog.

757
00:43:14,375 --> 00:43:15,208
And a snake!

758
00:43:16,917 --> 00:43:17,833
This dog is so powerful!

759
00:43:18,542 --> 00:43:19,292
So is the snake!

760
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:22,542
A rat!

761
00:43:24,875 --> 00:43:25,708
- It's so big! Have a look!
- Stop looking!

762
00:43:25,875 --> 00:43:27,583
You stepped on my clothes!

763
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:32,750
You are so ugly!

764
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:37,708
What's that?

765
00:43:38,625 --> 00:43:40,042
- Take it!
- No!

766
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:40,958
Take it!

767
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:44,375
Give it to me!

768
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:53,583
Are you alright?

769
00:43:57,292 --> 00:43:58,125
Don't let him discover!

770
00:44:00,292 --> 00:44:01,375
Hide up the box quickly!

771
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,417
You bandits! You are always late!

772
00:44:33,042 --> 00:44:34,250
Why are you that late

773
00:44:34,792 --> 00:44:38,417
Have you brought the excavations
you stole from the royal necropolis?

774
00:44:44,083 --> 00:44:46,417
This is stolen from the 10th grave.

775
00:44:55,917 --> 00:44:56,875
How about the bloody jade?

776
00:44:59,083 --> 00:44:59,958
Isn't it inside the box?

777
00:45:23,417 --> 00:45:25,125
It's a real bloody jade!

778
00:45:28,167 --> 00:45:29,208
This is yours.

779
00:45:32,333 --> 00:45:34,542
Why is there only abag of gold sand?
How about the rest?

780
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:36,958
You are the descendants from the Salt Gang£¬

781
00:45:37,292 --> 00:45:39,708
are you looking for a mysterious box?

782
00:45:39,917 --> 00:45:41,625
Box? You know where it is?

783
00:45:46,417 --> 00:45:47,333
Stop cheating me!

784
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,375
Have you heard of Righteous News?

785
00:45:50,917 --> 00:45:53,833
That box! I heard that it's kept
inside the press office.

786
00:45:54,417 --> 00:45:55,208
Go!

787
00:45:56,042 --> 00:45:57,292
Don't be that happy£¬ if you cheat me£¬

788
00:45:57,458 --> 00:45:58,333
I'll kill you!

789
00:45:58,708 --> 00:46:00,500
Never mind£¬ I'll wait for you!

790
00:46:23,375 --> 00:46:24,083
Are you going out?

791
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:26,667
Today isn't a good day£¬ it's not wise to go out!

792
00:46:29,542 --> 00:46:30,417
Master£¬ what's the mailer?

793
00:46:30,583 --> 00:46:31,542
Look outside!

794
00:46:36,375 --> 00:46:37,833
it's raining cats and dogs£¬ nothing special!

795
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:39,042
What else?

796
00:46:39,417 --> 00:46:40,417
There are many hawkers!

797
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:43,542
Selling fruits£¬ toys£¬
and paper sacrificial offerings!

798
00:46:43,708 --> 00:46:45,333
Right£¬ there is no reason for him
to sell paper sacrificial offerings here!

799
00:46:45,792 --> 00:46:47,875
That's righl! Call Chung Fat-pai!

800
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:51,625
Headmaster£¬ the press office
is surrounded by some strangers.

801
00:46:52,375 --> 00:46:54,792
It seems that£¬ we are surrounded by enemies!

802
00:46:55,125 --> 00:46:56,792
We should leave here as soon as possible!

803
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,667
Headmaster£¬ it'll be safe
to be an ordinary people now.

804
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,333
No way! Right at this moment£¬
we need the appearance of a mysterious hero.

805
00:47:04,875 --> 00:47:06,083
To let the power in the dark know that£¬

806
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:07,833
we£¬ the crime beaters

807
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,792
are picking on them!

808
00:47:09,917 --> 00:47:10,917
Headmaster!

809
00:47:11,083 --> 00:47:12,417
Take the box£¬ no one will pay attention to you.

810
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:15,583
Don't let others take it.

811
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:25,375
Masked hero£¬ for something precious£¬

812
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:29,208
it's not convenient to take it out.

813
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:33,292
If the bad guys take it£¬

814
00:47:33,708 --> 00:47:35,208
you will regret!

815
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:38,250
Right£¬ so I've decided to let you keep it.

816
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:41,417
You'll be wholely responsible!

817
00:47:43,542 --> 00:47:44,417
Be careful!

818
00:47:45,625 --> 00:47:46,667
It's so bright!

819
00:47:47,708 --> 00:47:49,042
Do you know what I am saying?

820
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:52,208
You want to use me to shift
the attention of those guys out there.

821
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:54,667
But they are not that easily be cheated.

822
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:00,417
Headmaster£¬ our electricity has been cut.

823
00:48:00,625 --> 00:48:01,750
They've rushed in.

824
00:48:01,917 --> 00:48:03,167
I'll stop them£¬ you'd better run.

825
00:48:03,333 --> 00:48:05,292
It'll be more dangerous to go out now.

826
00:48:06,042 --> 00:48:07,833
Let's shift their attention.

827
00:48:08,292 --> 00:48:09,708
They just aim at the box.

828
00:48:11,083 --> 00:48:12,500
Let's mask ourselves.

829
00:48:12,667 --> 00:48:14,667
Everyone holds one box.

830
00:48:14,875 --> 00:48:17,292
Then rush out and run into different directions!

831
00:48:17,667 --> 00:48:19,917
Good speech¡­

832
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:22,750
Masked hero£¬ only you know where the box is.

833
00:48:22,917 --> 00:48:23,875
Be careful.

834
00:48:24,125 --> 00:48:25,417
Pal£¬ I've misunderstood you.

835
00:48:25,625 --> 00:48:27,333
You are on our side instead.

836
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:29,208
It's not the point!

837
00:48:29,417 --> 00:48:31,500
We have not much time! Let's go out now.

838
00:48:31,792 --> 00:48:32,667
Run!

839
00:48:36,042 --> 00:48:38,083
I know you like mature men.

840
00:48:38,667 --> 00:48:39,958
I am not as mature as my master.

841
00:48:40,833 --> 00:48:42,167
But my master is married.

842
00:48:42,333 --> 00:48:44,000
That'snot my business.

843
00:48:44,167 --> 00:48:45,750
Whether you are married or not£¬
it's not my business either.

844
00:48:46,042 --> 00:48:47,542
Why do you get angry that easily?

845
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:49,625
We have no time to talk in details.

846
00:48:52,208 --> 00:48:53,458
From now on£¬

847
00:48:54,042 --> 00:48:55,875
whether I have a wife or you have any boyfriend£¬

848
00:48:56,042 --> 00:48:56,958
that concern us too.

849
00:48:57,708 --> 00:48:59,250
Since I want to court you£¬ you know?

850
00:48:59,417 --> 00:49:00,167
Yes.

851
00:49:00,625 --> 00:49:01,917
Have one more kiss.

852
00:49:02,125 --> 00:49:03,333
Damn it!

853
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,708
You are dying£¬ you know?

854
00:49:06,375 --> 00:49:07,208
Everyone holds a box£¬

855
00:49:07,667 --> 00:49:08,542
then run into different directions!

856
00:49:08,708 --> 00:49:09,417
Go.

857
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:11,167
I am leaving!

858
00:49:13,375 --> 00:49:15,958
Wait¡­

859
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:17,458
I have something to tell you.

860
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,042
You know what I am going to say?

861
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:32,000
I know you are a decent girl.

862
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:38,583
I know you are a foolish man£¬ like shit!

863
00:49:40,875 --> 00:49:42,542
I love to be a pile of shit.

864
00:49:43,417 --> 00:49:44,792
If only a flower is willing to be placed on it.

865
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:51,208
Take off your mask.

866
00:50:51,583 --> 00:50:52,375
Who is it?

867
00:50:53,708 --> 00:50:55,625
I am called Hung Sing.

868
00:50:55,875 --> 00:50:57,167
S nce my name is scaring£¬

869
00:50:57,333 --> 00:50:59,042
so the people will always tremble

870
00:50:59,375 --> 00:51:01,042
when they read my name...

871
00:51:01,292 --> 00:51:02,458
say£¬ Hung H ng Sing Sing.

872
00:51:03,042 --> 00:51:04,042
What's that bull shit!

873
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:05,875
Yan Yan£¬ you are no match for him!

874
00:51:11,542 --> 00:51:12,500
Be merc ful!

875
00:51:17,667 --> 00:51:21,333
Same as you! We are the descendants
from the Salt Gang.

876
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:25,208
Our ancestors discovered a mysterious box.

877
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:26,792
It can tell our future and history.

878
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,167
Don't be that mean£¬

879
00:51:28,333 --> 00:51:30,042
why not share it?

880
00:51:30,333 --> 00:51:32,167
I'd have a share of it.

881
00:51:32,333 --> 00:51:35,292
Why not open it and take a look.

882
00:51:36,375 --> 00:51:37,750
Mybe£¬ it'll be more suitable for me.

883
00:51:38,042 --> 00:51:39,167
I'd want to know the answer too.

884
00:51:39,333 --> 00:51:40,833
But£¬ you will regret if yoo open it.

885
00:51:41,583 --> 00:51:43,208
You'll regret if you don't open it!

886
00:52:13,917 --> 00:52:14,750
King of Adventurers?

887
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,500
Let me teach you a lesson.

888
00:52:57,458 --> 00:52:59,125
You always bluff others with money!

889
00:52:59,292 --> 00:53:00,167
I am helping your dad to teach you a lesson.

890
00:53:00,292 --> 00:53:02,625
Be a good boy...

891
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:14,083
Get back your clothe.

892
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:15,625
It's time for your mom.

893
00:53:15,792 --> 00:53:17,792
Your mom beats you£¬ your auntie beats you£¬
your grandma beats you¡­

894
00:53:19,083 --> 00:53:21,375
You can't even use a gun! So useless!

895
00:53:21,542 --> 00:53:22,833
You are a trash!

896
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,333
You are useless!

897
00:53:30,667 --> 00:53:31,625
I wanna beat you to death!

898
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:45,417
Why do you stand so far? Dare you come?

899
00:53:46,042 --> 00:53:47,375
I don't think you have so many pens!

900
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:50,875
Do you want my autograph?

901
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,500
Sign on your grave!

902
00:54:05,917 --> 00:54:06,875
Where can you go?

903
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:29,583
King of Adventurers£¬ I am a real man£¬

904
00:54:29,875 --> 00:54:31,042
you are no match for me.

905
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:34,625
Your dream lover£¬ Cammy is my subordinate!

906
00:54:35,208 --> 00:54:36,542
She is mine!

907
00:54:37,125 --> 00:54:38,792
Last time£¬ she was poisoned£¬ and I saved her.

908
00:54:39,292 --> 00:54:41,042
I do hope she would recover soon£¬

909
00:54:41,708 --> 00:54:44,250
to find a man she loves and live happily together.

910
00:54:44,708 --> 00:54:46,000
But that guy will never be you.

911
00:54:47,042 --> 00:54:48,250
You playboy!

912
00:54:48,417 --> 00:54:51,375
Don't bother others like a fly.

913
00:54:51,667 --> 00:54:53,542
And£¬ what did you say?

914
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:56,917
A real man?

915
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:58,125
Not you!

916
00:55:00,292 --> 00:55:02,125
I don't mean this£¬ you've misunderstood me.

917
00:55:02,583 --> 00:55:03,708
I am a man£¬ you too.

918
00:55:08,708 --> 00:55:09,750
But you are like shit!

919
00:55:10,583 --> 00:55:11,667
Masked hero£¬ how are you?

920
00:55:14,208 --> 00:55:15,417
I know it's you.

921
00:55:16,125 --> 00:55:19,542
King of Adventurers£¬ you are really capable.

922
00:55:19,833 --> 00:55:21,833
You need not mask and you are so famous!

923
00:55:22,375 --> 00:55:25,625
It seems you are a man
who has been hurt by a woman.

924
00:55:25,792 --> 00:55:27,375
I share the same point of view with you.

925
00:55:29,583 --> 00:55:30,667
Where is Hung Hung Sing Sing?

926
00:55:32,375 --> 00:55:34,083
What for? Do you want to treat him dinner?

927
00:55:34,292 --> 00:55:35,417
No...

928
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:37,917
When I went out of the press office£¬

929
00:55:38,708 --> 00:55:40,500
I saw your student being caught by his fellows.

930
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:42,875
I intended to catch Hung Sing
to exchange for your student.

931
00:55:43,042 --> 00:55:46,125
At least£¬ it would reduce much action scenes.

932
00:55:46,958 --> 00:55:47,750
I don't mind fighting.

933
00:55:47,917 --> 00:55:48,333
The first step£¬

934
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,167
I have to find out where
they have kept my student Shing.

935
00:55:50,333 --> 00:55:51,917
Go back first£¬ come on.

936
00:55:54,125 --> 00:55:55,333
Where am I now?

937
00:55:56,083 --> 00:55:57,375
Can you tell me your address?

938
00:55:57,792 --> 00:55:59,000
Or£¬ how can my master find me?

939
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:01,833
What's that? It stinks.

940
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:03,792
This is poisonous gas.

941
00:56:04,333 --> 00:56:07,667
Just stop breathing!
Pretend that you are in the water.

942
00:56:07,875 --> 00:56:10,833
About one hour later£¬ the smoke will be over.

943
00:56:11,792 --> 00:56:13,500
But£¬ no one can make it.

944
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,625
Should I get above the water?

945
00:56:19,625 --> 00:56:22,458
Don't step on the net£¬ let me come out.

946
00:56:42,292 --> 00:56:44,167
Master£¬ how come you are here?

947
00:56:44,375 --> 00:56:45,500
I know you are caught for the experiment.

948
00:56:52,958 --> 00:56:53,958
I know you will come.

949
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,250
No big deal! Just a piece of shit!

950
00:57:03,625 --> 00:57:04,333
I'll handle it.

951
00:57:06,417 --> 00:57:07,750
There is no bullet.

952
00:57:10,708 --> 00:57:11,917
But I don't like violence.

953
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:34,208
That's King of Adventurers.

954
00:58:43,708 --> 00:58:45,167
So fat is he! He must be a wrestler!

955
00:58:46,292 --> 00:58:47,542
Master£¬ I am ready.

956
00:58:55,708 --> 00:58:56,542
So fat!

957
00:59:15,292 --> 00:59:21,125
Watch my Tai Chi Stance!

958
01:00:14,083 --> 01:00:14,958
It's my turn.

959
01:00:16,083 --> 01:00:17,375
Master£¬ please teach me.

960
01:00:17,542 --> 01:00:19,208
How to throw that fatty to the sky?

961
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:23,208
It's easy£¬ all power is generated from ground.

962
01:00:23,875 --> 01:00:28,167
When a man is in the air£¬
he will be strongly hurt by a slight hit.

963
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:29,667
Do you understand?

964
01:00:30,208 --> 01:00:31,083
What's that?

965
01:00:31,375 --> 01:00:32,875
You always hide up£¬ why do you ask so much?

966
01:00:33,667 --> 01:00:34,625
That's right.

967
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:48,583
We still have an hour before we get on the train£¬
get back the box first.

968
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:51,917
Where is it?

969
01:00:57,417 --> 01:00:58,083
Here.

970
01:01:03,625 --> 01:01:04,333
Let's go.

971
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:11,167
Hung Hung Sing Sing!

972
01:01:11,625 --> 01:01:13,000
This time£¬ King of Adventurers won't save you.

973
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,458
Since he is saving his student now.

974
01:01:16,542 --> 01:01:18,208
For get about me£¬ get the box and leave.

975
01:01:20,917 --> 01:01:21,667
Headmaster.

976
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:24,708
Why are you still standing here?
I can't stand too long!

977
01:01:25,083 --> 01:01:26,958
Get the box and don't come back£¬ forget about me.

978
01:01:37,625 --> 01:01:39,833
How can you give the box
to an outsider! I'll get it back.

979
01:01:41,083 --> 01:01:41,958
Hung Hung Sing Sing.

980
01:01:44,958 --> 01:01:45,958
See what is written on it.

981
01:01:50,125 --> 01:01:51,458
Don't open the box.

982
01:02:17,083 --> 01:02:19,208
We cnn't stop him£¬ leave now!

983
01:02:28,583 --> 01:02:29,333
Headmaster.

984
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:31,167
Come here!

985
01:02:32,292 --> 01:02:33,792
My head swells!

986
01:03:00,792 --> 01:03:03,042
- Headmaster.
- Don't tell who is the masked hero.

987
01:03:03,583 --> 01:03:05,667
Ask King of Adventurers to get back the box.

988
01:03:06,042 --> 01:03:12,000
Headmaster...

989
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:16,792
Mr Editor!

990
01:03:19,417 --> 01:03:20,458
You've finally recovered.

991
01:03:21,042 --> 01:03:22,083
We are enemies from now on.

992
01:03:23,583 --> 01:03:24,625
I've predicted that.

993
01:03:28,792 --> 01:03:31,917
King of Adventurers has finally separated
with that nasty woman.

994
01:03:32,292 --> 01:03:34,542
It's dark£¬ but King of Adventurers knows that£¬

995
01:03:34,708 --> 01:03:37,000
when the sun rises£¬ another war will be started.

996
01:03:37,417 --> 01:03:40,542
He will keep on finding the box
which can tell fortunes.

997
01:03:45,833 --> 01:03:48,917
Miss Kwan£¬ you can take a walk today.

998
01:03:50,667 --> 01:03:54,167
Doctor£¬ may I know who sent me to the hospital?

999
01:03:54,667 --> 01:03:56,083
It's your husband Chow Si-kit.

1000
01:03:56,917 --> 01:03:58,958
But he told me not to tell you a word.

1001
01:03:59,292 --> 01:04:01,833
He didn't care his wound when he took you here£¬

1002
01:04:02,125 --> 01:04:04,125
but he just asked us to cure you first.

1003
01:04:04,583 --> 01:04:07,958
He cares you very much!

1004
01:04:08,375 --> 01:04:10,625
Now he is staying in the next ward.

1005
01:04:36,667 --> 01:04:39,208
Separtation! Separation at last.

1006
01:04:50,292 --> 01:04:52,125
How can he describe that woman like this!

1007
01:04:58,167 --> 01:05:00,375
But this woman was really bad!

1008
01:05:02,042 --> 01:05:04,250
After Cammy left King of Adventurers£¬

1009
01:05:04,875 --> 01:05:08,042
she knew very well that£¬

1010
01:05:08,208 --> 01:05:10,458
she was going the same way
with the King of Adventurers.

1011
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,292
Their adventure went up to the sky.

1012
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:23,875
The secret of the box is getting closer
and closer to them.

1013
01:05:29,708 --> 01:05:32,833
She looked down from the sky£¬

1014
01:05:33,125 --> 01:05:35,125
There was only one thing in Cammy's heart.

1015
01:05:35,542 --> 01:05:36,625
That's not the box.

1016
01:05:36,958 --> 01:05:38,500
But the King of Adventurers.

1017
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,792
Do you know where the scripture is?

1018
01:05:42,292 --> 01:05:43,750
It seems that£¬ you haven't given me something.

1019
01:05:50,167 --> 01:05:51,375
Turn back and take a look.

1020
01:05:51,708 --> 01:05:54,042
From the sutra£¬ it's said
the scripture was kept here.

1021
01:05:54,375 --> 01:05:56,958
After getting the scripture£¬ you will get the
mysterious power of telling fortune.

1022
01:06:03,083 --> 01:06:04,333
Ga Yu Gate?

1023
01:06:06,625 --> 01:06:08,500
Tell the control room to make
a direct flight to Ga Yu Gate.

1024
01:06:08,667 --> 01:06:09,583
Yes.

1025
01:06:11,958 --> 01:06:15,792
Will you hand the scripture
and the box to the Japanese Government?

1026
01:06:16,083 --> 01:06:18,042
Or£¬ have you thought of keeping it yourself?

1027
01:06:19,125 --> 01:06:21,500
I am not interested to be like Hung Sing.

1028
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:23,958
He didn't know he should put the scripture
inside the box first.

1029
01:06:24,083 --> 01:06:26,250
By the way£¬ he doesn't know
whether I read the sutra correctly.

1030
01:06:27,042 --> 01:06:30,208
Well£¬ what's the real pronounciation?

1031
01:06:30,958 --> 01:06:32,667
When you get the scripture and the box£¬

1032
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,875
you'll know it.

1033
01:06:38,792 --> 01:06:39,792
Bring me the wine.

1034
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:48,417
If you want to pull off a stunt£¬

1035
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:50,167
this will be your last meal.

1036
01:06:50,542 --> 01:06:52,917
Don't scare me£¬ or I will remember anything.

1037
01:06:53,792 --> 01:06:54,833
What about the rest?

1038
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,333
I'll give you the rest after the thing is done.

1039
01:07:08,625 --> 01:07:10,500
Chung Fat-pai£¬ why are you here?

1040
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,125
I just take a free ride.

1041
01:07:16,875 --> 01:07:17,792
Do you know where I am going?

1042
01:07:20,083 --> 01:07:21,583
Wherever you are going.

1043
01:07:21,792 --> 01:07:22,625
Still lying!

1044
01:07:23,042 --> 01:07:24,208
- Get him.
- Yes

1045
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:28,042
Damn you drunken man!

1046
01:07:30,458 --> 01:07:31,208
Why don't you follow our plan?

1047
01:07:31,375 --> 01:07:34,042
Bitch£¬ how dare you scold me?

1048
01:07:34,167 --> 01:07:34,750
Shut up!

1049
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:35,917
You bitch!

1050
01:07:36,083 --> 01:07:36,833
What's the matter?

1051
01:07:37,375 --> 01:07:40,292
None of your business£¬
this is the matter between us.

1052
01:07:40,458 --> 01:07:41,750
I will be the boss£¬ catch him.

1053
01:07:41,917 --> 01:07:42,667
Yes.

1054
01:07:44,958 --> 01:07:46,667
Men£¬ catch her.

1055
01:07:50,375 --> 01:07:51,917
You're so stupid!

1056
01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:53,958
You know£¬ they are all my men.

1057
01:07:54,125 --> 01:07:56,083
Wait£¬ Ican disclose my real identity now.

1058
01:07:56,250 --> 01:07:58,458
In fact£¬ I am an undercover! I am on his side.

1059
01:07:59,125 --> 01:08:00,833
You betrayer! Go to hell.

1060
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:05,208
Open the door¡­

1061
01:08:05,375 --> 01:08:06,292
Inform the control tower!

1062
01:08:06,458 --> 01:08:08,333
There is betrayer on the plane£¬
we have to fly back.

1063
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:09,250
Yes.

1064
01:08:12,167 --> 01:08:13,708
What did you say?

1065
01:08:15,333 --> 01:08:15,792
It's you!

1066
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:17,375
- What do you want?
- Don't move!

1067
01:08:18,958 --> 01:08:20,250
Now£¬ the plane is under my control.

1068
01:08:20,583 --> 01:08:21,417
Surrender!

1069
01:08:21,792 --> 01:08:23,917
Bastard! How dare you fool me?

1070
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:25,083
Do I?

1071
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:26,208
You control the plane first.

1072
01:08:26,458 --> 01:08:27,083
I can't make it.

1073
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:28,042
Up to you.

1074
01:08:28,333 --> 01:08:29,333
Up to you.

1075
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:31,458
At the very beginning£¬
you pretended to be waitress.

1076
01:08:31,625 --> 01:08:32,542
And cheated my sympathy.

1077
01:08:33,417 --> 01:08:34,958
I just want to help you.

1078
01:08:35,125 --> 01:08:37,167
Open the door¡­

1079
01:08:37,708 --> 01:08:39,375
- Shut up.
- Shut up

1080
01:08:40,333 --> 01:08:41,167
Theyare negotiating.

1081
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:44,208
Have you ever thought of it?

1082
01:08:44,375 --> 01:08:46,708
I wanted to save you thus I ran many people over!

1083
01:08:46,875 --> 01:08:47,542
Why did I do so?

1084
01:08:48,083 --> 01:08:48,875
How about me?

1085
01:08:49,042 --> 01:08:51,083
I asked my fellows not to use poisonous gas£¬
for I didn't want to hurt you

1086
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:52,875
That's why Ibroke the relationship
with my fellows. So£¬ take your time.

1087
01:08:53,083 --> 01:08:54,625
You know I am coming for the box£¬
why do you fight with me?

1088
01:08:54,875 --> 01:08:56,250
I was a waitress.

1089
01:08:56,417 --> 01:08:58,417
But you made me become a murderer!

1090
01:08:58,583 --> 01:09:00,500
Who dragged me like this? I am forced to do so.

1091
01:09:03,625 --> 01:09:05,375
So what? Whenever you lose your temper£¬

1092
01:09:05,833 --> 01:09:07,750
you just step out.

1093
01:09:10,917 --> 01:09:12,292
Forget everything£¬ let's die together.

1094
01:09:12,458 --> 01:09:13,917
We are close friends£¬

1095
01:09:14,125 --> 01:09:15,333
for we are common friends
of the King of Adventurers£¬

1096
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:16,167
and you are close friend of him¡­

1097
01:09:16,333 --> 01:09:17,292
Don't come over.

1098
01:09:18,917 --> 01:09:19,917
Now£¬ we still have three minutes.

1099
01:09:20,708 --> 01:09:21,750
If you have guts£¬ just bomb the plane.

1100
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:23,125
Don't you think I haven't?

1101
01:09:23,833 --> 01:09:24,958
The bomb is going to explode.

1102
01:09:25,125 --> 01:09:26,083
Let's die together.

1103
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,042
Bravo!

1104
01:09:28,375 --> 01:09:29,958
You fall deeply for each other.

1105
01:09:30,125 --> 01:09:31,417
There is nothing to do with us.

1106
01:09:31,583 --> 01:09:32,750
We just take a ride.

1107
01:09:33,083 --> 01:09:34,167
Now£¬ we are leaving.

1108
01:09:34,625 --> 01:09:36,292
So£¬ take your time.

1109
01:09:37,542 --> 01:09:38,667
Let's go.

1110
01:09:38,833 --> 01:09:39,500
Let's go¡­

1111
01:09:39,667 --> 01:09:41,458
What's up?

1112
01:09:41,958 --> 01:09:43,000
Can I jump with you?

1113
01:09:43,167 --> 01:09:43,917
On the wall.

1114
01:10:04,833 --> 01:10:06,375
There is someone up there.

1115
01:10:10,125 --> 01:10:11,125
What are you screaming?

1116
01:10:11,292 --> 01:10:12,833
Want to apologize? It's useless to wave.

1117
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,042
I won't forgive you.

1118
01:10:17,292 --> 01:10:18,917
There is someone up there.

1119
01:10:23,167 --> 01:10:24,125
Why don't you jump?

1120
01:10:24,542 --> 01:10:25,625
I will die with you!

1121
01:10:25,792 --> 01:10:27,292
Can you say something else?

1122
01:10:28,167 --> 01:10:29,125
Don't come over.

1123
01:10:32,042 --> 01:10:32,750
Hung Hung Sing Sing?

1124
01:10:39,833 --> 01:10:41,292
Boss£¬ I've got the box for you.

1125
01:11:13,167 --> 01:11:13,958
That box.

1126
01:11:16,542 --> 01:11:18,875
Master£¬ I said I don't know how to control aplane.

1127
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:27,458
Master£¬ have I improved?

1128
01:11:28,833 --> 01:11:29,500
Hung Hung Sing Sing?

1129
01:11:33,708 --> 01:11:34,625
Come out.

1130
01:11:42,583 --> 01:11:43,750
I've got you in.

1131
01:11:43,958 --> 01:11:45,292
Don't panic£¬ I'll protect you.

1132
01:12:02,125 --> 01:12:03,583
The plane is going to explode£¬ run now.

1133
01:12:07,625 --> 01:12:08,958
The box is out.

1134
01:12:14,625 --> 01:12:15,583
Let's jump.

1135
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:21,542
Jump!

1136
01:12:22,208 --> 01:12:22,875
How about you?

1137
01:12:23,042 --> 01:12:24,208
There is only one parachute.

1138
01:12:24,375 --> 01:12:25,125
Let's die together.

1139
01:12:25,292 --> 01:12:25,875
Jump or not?

1140
01:12:26,042 --> 01:12:26,625
No.

1141
01:12:26,792 --> 01:12:27,667
I'll jump.

1142
01:12:31,208 --> 01:12:33,125
Wait for me.

1143
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:47,875
Don't be nervous£¬ I'll open it for you.

1144
01:12:54,125 --> 01:12:55,208
This story is going to an end.

1145
01:12:55,917 --> 01:12:57,625
Let's forget who is right and wrong.

1146
01:12:58,625 --> 01:12:59,750
It doesn't matter.

1147
01:13:01,625 --> 01:13:02,875
Since you hate me that much£¬

1148
01:13:04,625 --> 01:13:06,000
I just want to tell you.

1149
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:07,833
When you see me in future£¬

1150
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:08,917
you must be happier.

1151
01:13:09,458 --> 01:13:10,375
You too.

1152
01:13:15,917 --> 01:13:16,875
Be careful.

1153
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:27,875
I am not afraid£¬ you would hug me.

1154
01:13:31,375 --> 01:13:32,083
Master.

1155
01:13:35,042 --> 01:13:36,458
We get a box there.

1156
01:13:36,958 --> 01:13:38,333
He always shows up in such moment.

1157
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,125
Why are you looking at me? Not this way!

1158
01:13:45,958 --> 01:13:46,792
Are we bothering them?

1159
01:13:46,958 --> 01:13:47,917
Bother?

1160
01:13:48,208 --> 01:13:49,125
Forget it.

1161
01:13:55,250 --> 01:13:56,417
It should be somewhere nearby.

1162
01:13:58,417 --> 01:13:59,917
How to get the scripture?

1163
01:14:03,708 --> 01:14:05,042
There will be an entrance.

1164
01:14:05,458 --> 01:14:06,792
We'd get an entrance first.

1165
01:14:08,208 --> 01:14:10,583
The sutra is written up side down.

1166
01:14:11,208 --> 01:14:13,125
You can tell by rubbing it with a piece of paper.

1167
01:14:14,042 --> 01:14:15,167
In other words£¬

1168
01:14:16,875 --> 01:14:21,542
the secret of the box£¬

1169
01:14:22,417 --> 01:14:23,708
isn't on the surface£¬

1170
01:14:24,542 --> 01:14:25,542
but at the bottom.

1171
01:14:27,125 --> 01:14:28,417
Check the bricks on the floor.

1172
01:14:36,583 --> 01:14:38,708
There are so many bricks on the floor£¬
when can we stop?

1173
01:14:39,583 --> 01:14:41,375
We have four persons here.

1174
01:14:41,625 --> 01:14:43,625
Check one by one£¬ it won't be very difficult.

1175
01:15:01,208 --> 01:15:02,750
Master£¬ see whether this hole is useful or not.

1176
01:15:08,708 --> 01:15:09,542
Put it in and test.

1177
01:16:13,667 --> 01:16:15,833
Master£¬ is that scripture of no words?

1178
01:16:19,333 --> 01:16:20,458
Wait.

1179
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,292
See the skulls.

1180
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:24,750
These people died here.

1181
01:16:26,375 --> 01:16:29,417
I think£¬ it must be caused by moving the sutra.

1182
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,083
I don't want to go on.

1183
01:16:31,792 --> 01:16:33,250
It's useless for me to get any scripture.

1184
01:16:33,667 --> 01:16:36,375
Let's give up the box and the scripture.

1185
01:16:36,833 --> 01:16:38,250
No way£¬ since we have come here.

1186
01:16:38,458 --> 01:16:39,417
I will never give up.

1187
01:16:40,042 --> 01:16:40,917
No...

1188
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:42,833
He is still alive!

1189
01:16:45,792 --> 01:16:46,417
Catch it.

1190
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,667
King of Adventurers£¬
I won't let you get what you want.

1191
01:17:12,875 --> 01:17:13,625
The scripture!

1192
01:17:14,583 --> 01:17:15,375
It's mine.

1193
01:17:23,083 --> 01:17:24,083
It's mine.

1194
01:17:24,333 --> 01:17:25,167
Catch it!

1195
01:17:28,375 --> 01:17:29,333
Catch it!

1196
01:17:31,375 --> 01:17:33,250
- so sharp!
- But it's useless.

1197
01:17:33,625 --> 01:17:34,333
Run now.

1198
01:17:39,917 --> 01:17:40,667
You evil!

1199
01:18:01,958 --> 01:18:02,833
King of Adventurers!

1200
01:18:05,542 --> 01:18:06,375
Do you want to lock me up?

1201
01:18:06,542 --> 01:18:07,958
I wanna chop you to death!

1202
01:18:16,125 --> 01:18:17,458
I won't die.

1203
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:43,208
That bastard!

1204
01:18:43,375 --> 01:18:45,167
Why did you brush King of Adventurers off
but followed him?

1205
01:18:45,333 --> 01:18:47,667
Why do you ask such bull shit now?

1206
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:50,167
She said it's bull shit!

1207
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:51,708
Right£¬ that's none of your business.

1208
01:18:51,875 --> 01:18:52,583
None of my business?

1209
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:54,167
Yes£¬ none of your business!

1210
01:19:11,958 --> 01:19:12,750
Master.

1211
01:19:27,583 --> 01:19:28,458
Pull with me.

1212
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:44,375
Go to hell.

1213
01:19:44,542 --> 01:19:45,417
What'll we do?

1214
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:46,625
Make him come here.

1215
01:19:47,917 --> 01:19:49,750
The scripture is right here£¬ if you have guts£¬
come get it.

1216
01:19:51,917 --> 01:19:52,750
Bingo!

1217
01:19:58,917 --> 01:20:00,542
- Let's have a drink.
- Cheers!

1218
01:20:02,208 --> 01:20:02,958
Go to hell.

1219
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:04,208
And...

1220
01:20:08,917 --> 01:20:09,583
Where is the scripture?

1221
01:20:13,792 --> 01:20:14,667
The scripture?

1222
01:20:18,458 --> 01:20:19,125
Thisway!

1223
01:20:22,833 --> 01:20:23,583
Why do you fight here?

1224
01:20:24,083 --> 01:20:24,917
Better go that way.

1225
01:20:27,250 --> 01:20:27,958
Hands off me.

1226
01:20:28,125 --> 01:20:28,917
Do you know whom have you caught?

1227
01:20:29,083 --> 01:20:30,667
Stop! Do you know you are in real danger?

1228
01:20:30,833 --> 01:20:32,542
Run! Run!

1229
01:20:32,708 --> 01:20:34,292
He is following us! Run!

1230
01:20:34,792 --> 01:20:35,625
It's hard to save him!

1231
01:20:44,292 --> 01:20:45,583
Three of you are here.

1232
01:20:45,958 --> 01:20:47,458
Iam glad you are all safe!

1233
01:20:47,625 --> 01:20:49,208
We have fixed him! Wonderful!

1234
01:20:51,958 --> 01:20:52,958
Send appreciation to me please.

1235
01:20:55,625 --> 01:20:56,333
Run!

1236
01:20:58,875 --> 01:20:59,417
Shing!

1237
01:21:00,333 --> 01:21:01,542
Hung Hung Sing Sing£¬catch it.

1238
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:05,167
It's on fire.

1239
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:06,208
Go to hell

1240
01:21:09,125 --> 01:21:10,375
Open the box.

1241
01:21:10,625 --> 01:21:11,667
Remember that rat?

1242
01:21:11,958 --> 01:21:12,375
The rat.

1243
01:21:12,542 --> 01:21:13,625
The long one inside the compose office.

1244
01:21:13,792 --> 01:21:14,708
After the first shine£¬ its form changed.

1245
01:21:14,875 --> 01:21:16,625
The second time£¬ it became tiny balls.

1246
01:21:17,167 --> 01:21:18,167
Shine on him now.

1247
01:21:18,333 --> 01:21:20,000
He will disappear then!

1248
01:21:35,375 --> 01:21:36,250
Monica

1249
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:39,583
She isn't called Monica in the novel.

1250
01:21:39,958 --> 01:21:41,125
Don't come here.

1251
01:21:41,333 --> 01:21:42,125
Honey!

1252
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,083
Let Cammy go!

1253
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,167
Master£¬ I'll help you.

1254
01:21:56,833 --> 01:21:58,667
In this world£¬ what I can't possess£¬

1255
01:21:58,875 --> 01:22:00,958
I no one can possess too.

1256
01:22:01,167 --> 01:22:02,333
Serve you right.

1257
01:22:03,875 --> 01:22:05,000
Don't you think it's only you
who has this in mind?

1258
01:22:14,917 --> 01:22:17,208
Hands off£¬ or you will die!

1259
01:22:27,417 --> 01:22:28,917
Are they yours or mine?

1260
01:22:29,042 --> 01:22:30,292
Forget about it£¬ just put it in your pocket.

1261
01:22:30,792 --> 01:22:31,500
Honey!

1262
01:22:37,417 --> 01:22:38,625
Open the box and shine on us.

1263
01:22:38,792 --> 01:22:39,958
We will then disappear!

1264
01:22:40,375 --> 01:22:41,042
No way.

1265
01:22:41,667 --> 01:22:42,583
How is Monica?

1266
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:45,917
Let me open it!

1267
01:22:46,792 --> 01:22:47,458
Give it to me!

1268
01:22:50,583 --> 01:22:51,875
King of Adventurers!

1269
01:22:56,167 --> 01:22:56,917
Give me the box.

1270
01:22:59,792 --> 01:23:01,417
Hurry up! Or you can't make it£¬

1271
01:23:01,583 --> 01:23:03,167
Open it.

1272
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:06,500
You can't hesistate now!

1273
01:23:07,792 --> 01:23:09,417
Why do you push me to make a decision?

1274
01:23:10,333 --> 01:23:12,750
Only our separation can solve the problem!

1275
01:23:15,875 --> 01:23:16,625
Let me do it.

1276
01:23:29,250 --> 01:23:30,292
Monica

1277
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:22,042
We have got the box and scripture at last!

1278
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:23,583
But¡­

1279
01:24:26,083 --> 01:24:26,958
What's that?

1280
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:28,083
How is it?

1281
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:33,875
Dr. Lo said the scripture

1282
01:24:34,042 --> 01:24:35,750
and the box should be put together
to know the future.

1283
01:24:52,083 --> 01:24:55,375
In this human world£¬

1284
01:24:55,708 --> 01:24:58,875
there is no end and no beginning£¬

1285
01:24:59,333 --> 01:25:02,292
the scripture returns to its precious box at last.

1286
01:25:03,375 --> 01:25:06,375
Everyone of you will have a wish.

1287
01:25:06,667 --> 01:25:08,542
To know one thing in future.

1288
01:25:09,292 --> 01:25:10,333
This is funny!

1289
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:12,792
May I know who will be my husband?

1290
01:25:13,083 --> 01:25:16,375
You can tell it from the wall behind.

1291
01:25:16,667 --> 01:25:19,083
There you can see your wish!

1292
01:25:28,042 --> 01:25:29,625
Why it's you!

1293
01:25:30,667 --> 01:25:32,292
Why do you react like this?

1294
01:25:33,958 --> 01:25:36,125
Can I see the smartest look of mine?

1295
01:25:43,792 --> 01:25:44,917
Samescene.

1296
01:25:45,625 --> 01:25:46,708
This is your smartest look!

1297
01:25:46,917 --> 01:25:48,458
So discouraging!

1298
01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:51,750
Don't be so mean£¬ it's destinated to be you.

1299
01:25:56,083 --> 01:25:58,333
King of Adventurers£¬ it's your turn.

1300
01:25:58,875 --> 01:26:02,208
About future£¬ what do you want to know?

1301
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:03,750
I don't know what should be asked.

1302
01:26:04,708 --> 01:26:06,125
Well...

1303
01:26:07,917 --> 01:26:10,250
Can I see Monica again?

1304
01:26:10,417 --> 01:26:13,250
For many things£¬ hatred comes from love.

1305
01:26:13,667 --> 01:26:18,833
And it causes fights and killings too.

1306
01:26:19,542 --> 01:26:25,792
In fact£¬ there will be chance!

1307
01:26:26,458 --> 01:26:29,833
People control everything.

1308
01:26:30,417 --> 01:26:34,542
The one you are looking for£¬

1309
01:26:34,792 --> 01:26:37,333
is inside this city.

1310
01:26:37,542 --> 01:26:38,458
Monica!

1311
01:26:38,625 --> 01:26:40,042
Master£¬ look

1312
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:49,292
Remember£¬

1313
01:26:49,458 --> 01:26:54,625
there will be chance anyway.

1314
01:26:54,792 --> 01:26:57,792
Value your future!

1315
01:27:05,083 --> 01:27:05,958
Where have you gone?

1316
01:27:06,125 --> 01:27:06,875
For food.

1317
01:27:07,792 --> 01:27:09,042
With a boy or girl?

1318
01:27:09,208 --> 01:27:10,208
With my classmate!

1319
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:13,333
You don't know either£¬
please don't ask£¬ I am tired.

1320
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:15,458
A meal made you feel tired?

1321
01:27:19,333 --> 01:27:20,375
I'm better now.

1322
01:27:23,583 --> 01:27:26,000
I changed the ending of your novel£¬
don't you get angry?

1323
01:27:26,167 --> 01:27:28,042
No£¬ it's good.

1324
01:27:28,375 --> 01:27:29,833
The girl is quite lovely.

1325
01:27:37,333 --> 01:27:40,125
I've signed the divorce paper.

1326
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:41,250
It's your turn.

1327
01:27:42,542 --> 01:27:43,667
Why did you sign?

1328
01:27:45,125 --> 01:27:46,375
I don't know how to flatter girls.

1329
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,708
If I sign and you will be happy¡­

1330
01:27:48,875 --> 01:27:50,542
Well£¬ I'll sign it.

1331
01:27:52,875 --> 01:27:54,667
Alright£¬ Iwill sign.

1332
01:27:54,958 --> 01:27:55,833
Give me the pen please.

1333
01:28:10,042 --> 01:28:11,792
I've signed.

1334
01:28:25,083 --> 01:28:26,542
I said£¬ you won't sign!

1335
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:29,208
No! I haven't signed.

1336
01:28:29,375 --> 01:28:30,583
It'll be effective anytime.

1337
01:28:30,833 --> 01:28:32,375
Bring it back!

1338
01:28:34,708 --> 01:28:37,875
I can't imagine that we would be seriously hurt.

1339
01:28:38,042 --> 01:28:40,125
In fact£¬ the most risky thing in this world

1340
01:28:40,292 --> 01:28:43,250
is how to stay with one person without any change.

1341
01:28:43,417 --> 01:28:46,417
So£¬ in this city£¬
we always need King of Adventurers!
