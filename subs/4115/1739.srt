Or babysitting,
maybe, yeah.

130
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:10,361
噢，天啊，而且你妈妈过去常常教我们唱最荒谬的歌
Oh, God, and your mom used to make
us sing the most ridiculous songs.

131
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:15,333
抱歉，不该提的
Shit. I'm sorry.

132
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:16,600
没什么需要抱歉的
Nothing to be sorry about.

133
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:20,204
我知道那对你们来说很辛苦
I know it was hard on you guys.

134
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:21,639
是啊
Yeah.

135
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:24,241
所以，你回来呆多久？
So, how long are you here for?

136
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:25,776
几个星期
- A few weeks.
然后呢
- Then what?

137
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:29,347
然后就看他们下一站想让我去哪了。
Then it's off to wherever
they want to send me next.

138
00:07:34,152 --> 00:07:35,286
嘿，托尼！
Hey, Toni!

139
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:39,290
我们就在那，嗨！
- We're right here. Hi.
好的
- Okay.

140
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:43,761
下次见
- I'll see you.
好的
- Yeah.

141
00:07:47,299 --> 00:07:48,599
你们不会介意的，是吗
You guys won't miss these,
right?

142
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:51,335
是，当然不介意
- No, of course not.
一点也不，托尼
- Not at all, Toni.

143
00:07:54,906 --> 00:07:57,441
嘿，宝贝
Hey, sweetie.

144
00:07:58,243 --> 00:08:00,144
你怎么搞上的?
What's gotten into you?

145
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,948
马特，不错的比赛
- Matt, nice game.
是的。是让人感到惊讶吗？
- Yeah, wasn't it amazing?

146
00:08:13,425 --> 00:08:15,592
你输了？
- You out?
是的，老兄，我输了
- Yeah, man, I'm out.

147
00:08:15,594 --> 00:08:16,927
我们现在得到的报告
<i>And we're getting reports now</i>

148
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:20,364
断电可能延伸整个西北道路
<i>that the blackout may run along
the entire Northwest corridor.</i>

149
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:25,302
仍然没有关于造成巨大失误的原因信息，但是...
<i>Still no information on what may have
caused this massive failure, but...</i>

150
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,173
那么，马特
- So, Matty.
哟
- Yo!

151
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:33,277
你怎么没告诉我你哥长大回来了
You didn't tell me your brother
was back and all grown up.

152
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,545
你为什么会有兴趣？
Why are you so interested?

153
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:40,484
因为我只是个孩子而且我好奇手足之争
Because I'm an only child and
I'm curious about sibling rivalry.

154
00:08:44,122 --> 00:08:46,223
我希望你告诉过我们你要来。
I wish you had told us you were coming.

155
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:49,226
我还是没找到多余的床单。
I still can't find the extra
sheets for the foldout.

156
00:08:49,227 --> 00:08:51,862
我到处都找了
- I've looked everywhere.
老爸，别麻烦了
- Dad, don't worry about it.

157
00:08:51,863 --> 00:08:54,098
睡沙发就行了
The couch is fine.

158
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:05,443
爱你
Love you.

159
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:06,310
我爱你
I love you!

160
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:09,447
爱你
- Love you.
爱你

161
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:10,781
再见
See you.

162
00:09:12,384 --> 00:09:13,684
嘿，孩子们
Hey, girls.

163
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:14,452
嗨
- Hi.
嘿
- Hey.

164
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:18,255
收到断电通知，得去控制一下。
Got blackout duty.
Got to go rein in the crazies.

165
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:20,224
那个，你看过比赛了吗？
So, you saw the game?

166
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,327
是的，先生，我全程都看了
Yes, sir, I saw it all.

167
00:09:24,496 --> 00:09:25,196
我为你自豪
I'm proud of you.

168
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:28,599
你尽了最大的努力。这才是最重要的
You played your hardest.
That's what matters.

169
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:31,669
他们很幸运拥有你
They're lucky to have you.

170
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,204
再见
Later.

171
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,028
要啤酒吗
You want a beer?

172
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:04,635
嘿，马特，你在干嘛
Hey, Matty,
what are you doing?

173
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,337
我在拿喝的
I'm getting a drink.

174
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,707
好吧，你拿了喝的。就把冰箱关上，耗电
Okay, you got a drink.
Close the door, the power's out.

175
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:10,441
放松，老兄
Lighten up, man.

176
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:14,111
嘿，你不用去确保边界什么的安全吗
Hey, don't you have to secure
the perimeter or something?

177
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,882
在冲洗器的公司集合吗？
A rendezvous with douche company?

178
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:03,661
发生什么事了？
What's going on?

179
00:11:33,158 --> 00:11:37,094
马特！我们必须去找老爸。快点
Matty! We've got to find Dad.
Come on.

180
00:11:49,574 --> 00:11:50,841
我还没反应过来
I got no reception!

181
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:52,376
试试收音机
Try the radio.

182
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:55,879
我艹
Son of a bitch.

183
00:11:57,215 --> 00:11:58,849
这是什么？
What is this?

184
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,584
不知道
I don't know.

185
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:04,488
艹
Shit.

186
00:12:04,923 --> 00:12:06,390
坚持一下
Hang on!

187
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:21,972

Stay on my ass!

00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,961
撑住！
Hang on!

00:12:46,698 --> 00:12:48,298
艹
Shit!

190
00:12:53,538 --> 00:12:55,539
进车里去！
- Get to the cabin!
是什么？不
- What? No!

191
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,274
进车里！
The cabin!

192
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,109
杰德，照顾好你弟，你听到我说的了吗？
Jed, take care of your brother, you hear me?

193
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:02,212
你们还可以离开这里。快走！现在！
Get out of here while you still can.
Go now! Go!

194
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:05,315
不！
- No!
快走！
- Come on!

195
00:13:11,022 --> 00:13:12,556
杰德，走！
Jed, go!

196
00:13:16,628 --> 00:13:19,630
杰德，我们得去找到艾丽卡
- Jed, we got to get Erica.
在哪
- Where?

197
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,231

坚持住
Hold on!

200
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:52,529
艾丽卡
Erica.

201
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,933
马特

艾丽卡

202
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,534
不，马特

00:14:00,171 --> 00:14:01,672
放开我！
Get off me!

204
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,474
艾丽卡
Erica!

205
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,309

跳进来
Jump in!

快快快！
Go, go, go!

00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,394
不，不，不！
No, no, no!

211
00:14:25,463 --> 00:14:26,263
不，那是我儿子！
No, that's my son!

212
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:29,867
他们只是孩子，好吗？他们还只是孩子
They're just boys, okay?
They're just boys.

213
00:14:46,117 --> 00:14:49,253
我们怎么做？
- What do we do?
跟着我们就行
- Just follow us!

214
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,754
快点！

有人受伤吗
Anyone hurt?

222
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,567
我不知道
I don't know.

223
00:16:43,868 --> 00:16:45,869
应该没有
I don't think so.

224
00:16:47,105 --> 00:16:49,439
我们得离开，明白吗？
We had to leave, okay?

225
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:58,882
我是派特
I'm Pete.

226
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,821
他们从外地来的。
They're from out of town.

227
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,690
圣地亚哥或什么地方（美国港口城市）
San Diego or something.

228
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,326
他们刚刚眼见自己老爸被杀了
They just saw
their dad get killed.

229
00:17:12,196 --> 00:17:12,896
好的，听着
Okay, listen.

230
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:17,134
我想你带着这些人去里面，看能找到什么有用的东西
I want you to take these guys and
see what you can find in there.

231
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:18,135
我带着发电机进去
I'll get the generator going.

232
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:20,103
杰德，我们得去搞清楚发生了什么
Jed, we got to
find out what's going on.

233
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:21,071
我的爸妈，我妈妈呢？
My parents,
what about my mom?

234
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:24,174
罗伯特，你是对的。交给你。找个电视机或收音机
Robert, you're right. That's your job.
So, find a radio or TV

235
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,976
并找到信号。让它工作，没问题吧？
and get us reception.
Get it working, okay?

236
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:29,346
但是杰德。我们不能坐以待毙
- But Jed, we can't just stay here.
回答是的，罗伯特
- Say yes, Robert.

237
00:17:29,747 --> 00:17:31,248
是的
Yeah.

238
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:33,250
很好
Okay.

239
00:17:54,272 --> 00:17:56,206
把它勾在那
Hook it in there.

240
00:18:18,662 --> 00:18:20,932
来到你生活在西雅图。
<i>Coming to you 
live from Seattle.</i>

241
00:18:21,766 --> 00:18:23,266
那儿
There.

242
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:26,136
是这吗
- Is that it?
不不，回去一点
- No, no. Go back.

243
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:26,737
停，停
Freeze, freeze.

244
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:28,972
...不再受美国政府的控制　
<i>...no longer controlled by the
government of the United States.</i>

245
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:31,408
不要去外面,除非这是一个绝对紧急情况
<i>Don't go outside unless
it's an absolute emergency.</i>

246
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:36,813
当人们做一些不必要的移动，交通事故才会更容易发生　　
<i>Accidents are more likely to happen
when people move about unnecessarily.</i>

247
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:37,381
交通事故？
Accidents?

248
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:39,850
如果你已经和某人分离并且你不知道他们在哪里
<i>If you've become separated from someone
and you don't know where they are,</i>

249
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,953
已经开通来帮助你热线
<i>a hotline has been
set up to help you.</i>

250
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,421
嘿，你干嘛，老兄？
Hey, what the hell, man?

251
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:46,356
胡说八道
Bullshit.

252
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:48,225
什么意思
What does that mean?

253
00:18:49,193 --> 00:18:51,795
意思是我们完蛋了
It means we're screwed.

254
00:19:09,814 --> 00:19:11,381
嘿
Hey!

255
00:19:11,883 --> 00:19:14,017
嘿！你们听到了吗
Hey! Do you hear that?

256
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:17,554
马特，立刻关登。我们走
Matty, kill the lights.
Let's go!

257
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:19,890
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

258
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:22,893
我打算把他们吸引开，希望他们能上钩
I'm going to draw them away and
hope like hell they take the bait.

259
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:23,560
我跟你一起
I'll come with you.

260
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:26,296
不，你现在去关灯并让里面的家伙们安静
No, you're gonna be cutting the lights
and keeping those assholes quiet.

261
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:29,866
如果我去关灯...
- What if I cut the...
照我说的做
- Just do what I say.

262
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,217
快啊，马特
Come on, Matty.

263
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:05,235
不！
No!

264
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:08,004
停下！别开火
Stop! Hold your fire.

265
00:20:10,074 --> 00:20:12,075
你怎么告诉你的？
- What did I tell you to do?
那不是我
- It wasn't me.

266
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:13,477
你差点打爆我的头
You almost took my head off!

267
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:15,612
我以为他们越过你了
I thought they got past you.

268
00:20:17,815 --> 00:20:19,416
把枪给我
You give me the gun.

269
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:21,618
混蛋我才不给你
I'm not giving you dick.

270
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,488
谁他妈说这里你负责了？
Who the hell
put you in charge, anyway?

271
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:28,592
好吧，我们和解
Okay, let's compromise.

272
00:20:32,396 --> 00:20:33,897
什么？
What?

273
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,665
再来？
More?

274
00:20:40,771 --> 00:20:42,606
艹
Shit.

275
00:20:42,707 --> 00:20:44,708
给我
Give me that.

276
00:20:46,043 --> 00:20:47,577
丹尼
Danny.

277
00:20:47,678 --> 00:20:49,346
Man!

278
00:20:49,547 --> 00:20:51,481
你爸爸说你在这里。
Your dad said you were up here.

279
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:53,617
你看到他了？他还好吗？
You saw him? Was he okay?

280
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:56,720
是的，但是坏人都在下面呢
Yeah, but it's bad down there, man.

281
00:20:58,923 --> 00:21:00,757
我们的军队都去哪了，杰德？
Where are our troops, Jed?

282
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,325
我不知道
I don't know.

283
00:21:03,961 --> 00:21:05,495
托尼
Toni.

284
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:06,997
你受伤了吗？
You hurt?

285
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,166
不，我没事
No, I'm fine.

286
00:21:09,467 --> 00:21:10,901
那就好
Fine.

287
00:21:11,736 --> 00:21:14,070
艾丽卡在吗？
Is Erica here?

288
00:21:14,305 --> 00:21:16,940
我想她被抓走了
I think they took her.

289
00:21:22,747 --> 00:21:24,948
所有人进屋
Everybody inside.

290
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:42,199
起来
Wake up.

291
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:42,832
怎么了？
What's wrong?

292
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:46,636
那个可恶的派特和他朋友拿走了所有食物离开了
That asshole Pete and his buddy
took off with all the food.

293
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,772
我需要你们拿上所有我们能用的
I need you guys
to take anything we can use,

294
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,807
放到卡车上然后藏进丛林去
put it in the truck
and hide it in the woods.

295
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,944
那王八蛋知道我们在哪，所以都睁大眼睛
And that prick knows where
we are so keep your eyes open.

296
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:57,414
马特，跟我来。我们走。起床了。
Matty, come with me.
Let's go. Get up.

297
00:22:03,721 --> 00:22:05,088
北朝鲜
North Korea.

298
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,122
这说不通啊
It doesn't make any sense.

299
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:09,693
这里有这么大一片地方。他们必须有帮助
There's a bigger picture here.
They had to have had help.

300
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:11,161
你认为到处都是这样的?
You think it's like this everywhere?

301
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:16,399
我不认为这是他们所有，这条路是去华盛顿州和西雅图的
I don't think they've come all，this
way just for Spokane and Seattle.

302
00:22:22,139 --> 00:22:24,274
你觉得老爸在哪？
Where do you think Dad is?

303
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,942
很可能在下面
Probably down there.

304
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:31,681
和任何人一个他们认为有威胁或他们可以得到的信息的人。
With anyone else they think is a
threat or they can get information from.

305
00:22:33,851 --> 00:22:36,653
你认为艾丽卡在那？
You think Erica is
in there?

306
00:22:37,655 --> 00:22:39,990
你女人是个战士
Your girl is a fighter.

307
00:22:40,324 --> 00:22:41,891
她会没事的
She'll be okay.

308
00:22:42,393 --> 00:22:43,994
我们得想办法救出他们
We got to get them
out of there.

309
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:46,029
我们不能直接打911，马特
We can't just call 911, Matty.

310
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:51,234
我们现在必须留在原地并祈祷它不会更糟了。
We got to stay put for now and just
pray like hell it doesn't get any worse.

311
00:22:52,203 --> 00:22:54,104
嘿！
Hey!

312
00:22:57,708 --> 00:23:00,877
嘿！他们找到我们了
Hey! They found us.

313
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:11,321
这里一个人也没有
There's no one here.

314
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:14,791
我发誓。他们本来就藏在这
I swear.
This is where they were.

315
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:18,395
妈的。派特出卖我们
Son of a bitch.
It's Pete.

316
00:23:24,101 --> 00:23:26,469
天啊。达利尔，那是你爸爸
Holy shit. Daryl,
that's your dad.

317
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:28,271
事儿么？让我看
What? Let me see.

318
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:30,507
安静。蹲伏
Quiet. Stay down.

319
00:23:33,711 --> 00:23:35,612
耶稣基督
Jesus Christ.

320
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,626
孩子们
<i>Boys,</i>

321
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,961
我是市长詹金斯
<i>it's Mayor Jenkins.</i>

322
00:23:52,396 --> 00:23:58,368
这个地区的首席长官
<i>Captain Cho here is the acting 
prefect of this district.</i>

323
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:03,039
他说你严重的伤害了他的一些士兵
<i>He says you seriously injured
some of his men</i>

324
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,374
但是他向我保证
<i>and he's given me his word,</i>

325
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:10,780
如果你自己走出来，所有人都不会被伤害。好吗?
<i>if you turn yourselves in,
no one is going to be hurt. Okay?</i>

326
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:17,053
孩子们？
<i>Boys?</i>

327
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,665
达利尔？
<i>Daryl?</i>

328
00:24:30,701 --> 00:24:32,035
儿子？
<i>Son?</i>

329
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:34,904
我希望你能回家
<i>I'd like you to come home.</i>

330
00:24:41,512 --> 00:24:44,514
伙计们,我们不是应该按照他说的去做吗?
Guys, shouldn't we do what he says?

331
00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:46,549
我们该怎么做，杰德？
What do we do, Jed?

332
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:47,117
我们不动
We don't move.

333
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:50,787
但是如果我爸爸相信这些人...
- But if my dad trusts this guy...
达利尔，闭嘴
- Daryl, shut up.

334
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:52,922
所有人静观其变
Everybody stay still.

335
00:25:05,703 --> 00:25:07,437
孩子们
<i>Boys.</i>

336
00:25:07,605 --> 00:25:09,038
如果你们在这里
<i>If you're out there,</i>

337
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,175
如果你们能听到我的话，听好了
<i>if you can hear me,
listen up.</i>

338
00:25:12,376 --> 00:25:16,146
这是一个艰难的局面，附近的所有道路
<i>It's a tough situation
all the way around.</i>

339
00:25:16,614 --> 00:25:19,783
很多艰难的选择
<i>A lot of tough choices.</i>

340
00:25:22,353 --> 00:25:24,454
我爱你们
<i>I love you both.</i>

341
00:25:28,092 --> 00:25:30,093
我希望你们知道
<i>I hope you know that.</i>

342
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:41,738
接下来我要求你们做的
<i>What I'm going to
ask you to do</i>

343
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,340
可能会艰难无比
<i>may be very difficult,</i>

344
00:25:45,776 --> 00:25:48,545
但是我希望你们
<i>but I want you boys</i>

345
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,481
能够做到我说的
<i>to do what I would do.</i>

346
00:25:53,017 --> 00:25:58,688
我希望你们去战斗并且阻止这些垃圾们
<i>I want you to go to war
and stop this piece of shit.</i>

347
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,657
或者被杀死
<i>Or die trying.</i>

348
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,073
汤姆
Tom!

349
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:21,044
不!不！
- No! No!
马特！呆在这儿！
- Matty! Stay here!

350
00:27:39,156 --> 00:27:40,456
他们会发现我们的
They're going to find us.

351
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:43,459
伙计们，我们到底在上面干什么?
Guys, what are we even doing up here?

352
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:45,495
我们应该回去
We should just go back.

353
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:46,829
马特，我感到抱歉
Matt, I'm sorry.

354
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,865
我的父母还在下面
My parents are
still down there.

355
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:51,968
我也担心我爸的安危
I'm worried something's
going to happen to my dad.

356
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,202
也许他能帮助我们
Maybe he could help us.

357
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:55,572
他帮不了我们，达利尔
He can't help us, Daryl.

358
00:27:55,574 --> 00:27:56,639
他在帮他们
He's helping them.

359
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:57,974
那是什么意思？
What's that supposed to mean?

360
00:27:57,976 --> 00:27:59,208
就是他在帮助他们
It means he's helping them.

361
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,811
你看到他了，他只是在那里看着
You saw him, he just stood there and watched.

362
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,713
那他还应该做些什么？
What else was he supposed to do?

363
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:05,882
我们的父亲做出了选择
Our dad made a choice.

364
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:09,819
同样达利尔的父亲也要做出选择。我们都需要
And Daryl's dad's got to
make one, too. We all do.

365
00:28:17,061 --> 00:28:18,628
我们要回家
We're going home.

366
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,262
罗伯特
Robert,

367
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:22,165
我家人不在下面了
your parents aren't
down there.

368
00:28:28,005 --> 00:28:32,141
我看到了。我不知道该如何告诉你
I saw it. I didn't know
how to tell you.

369
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,854
我们不能回家
We can't go home.

370
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:48,825
我们不能乱跑。那我们到底该干嘛？
We can't keep running.
What are we supposed to do?

371
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:54,530
我要去战斗
I'm going to fight.

372
00:28:56,233 --> 00:28:58,434
我要去战斗
I'm going to fight.

373
00:28:58,602 --> 00:29:02,472
现在这是对我更容易，因为我习惯了。
Now this is easier for me
because I'm used to it.

374
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:06,142
但是其余的你们要做有一个很难的选择
But the rest of you are going
to have a tougher choice.

375
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:10,580
听着，我不想强加给你们，因为现实太丑陋
Look, I don't want to sell it
to you, it's too ugly for that.

376
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,915
不仅丑陋，更困难
It's ugly, and it's hard.

377
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,251
但当你在自己的后院战斗,
But when you're fighting
in your own backyard,

378
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,820
为了你的家人而战斗
and you're fighting
for your family,

379
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:22,225
它会感到伤害少一点,而更有意义。
it all hurts a little less and
it makes a little more sense.

380
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:26,529
而对他们而言，这仅仅是个陌生地
And for them,
this is just some place.

381
00:29:26,897 --> 00:29:28,631
但对我们而言，
But for us,

382
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:31,267
是家园
this is our home.

383
00:29:34,537 --> 00:29:39,942
显然,我们没有机会对这些家伙在正面对抗
<i>Obviously, we don't stand a chance
against these guys in a straight-up fight.</i>

384
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,845
但是如果你看看，越共或穆斯林游击队员
<i>But if you look at the
Viet Cong or the Mujahideen,</i>

385
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:45,414
甚至是义勇军，很明显了。
<i>or even the Minutemen,
it's clear.</i>

386
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:50,052
即使最微小的跳蚤，都可以使一个大狗发疯
<i>Even the tiniest flea
can drive a big dog crazy.</i>

387
00:29:52,255 --> 00:29:57,559
所以，我们首先要学习的是如何团队合作
<i>So, the first thing we have to
do is learn how to work together.</i>

388
00:29:58,328 --> 00:29:59,862
成为一个团队
<i>Become a unit.</i>

389
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:03,265
然而这需要一些时间
<i>And that's going to
take some time.</i>

390
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:04,700
太恶心了
That's gross.

391
00:30:06,737 --> 00:30:09,071
拉一个触发器，不需要太多时间　　
<i>It doesn't take much
to pull a trigger.</i>

392
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:14,610
但要在交火中保持团结又是另外一回事
<i>But keeping your shit together in a
firefight is a whole different story.</i>

393
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:17,713
所以我们接下来要进行演练
<i>So we're going to
have to evolve.</i>

394
00:30:18,348 --> 00:30:20,816
我们的反应能力
<i>Rewire our reflexes.</i>

395
00:30:20,818 --> 00:30:25,020
学习新技能和适应学过的
<i>Learn new skills
and adapt old ones.</i>

396
00:30:25,522 --> 00:30:30,893
有将近一百万的面孔在下面,他们不能跟踪他们所有。
<i>There's almost half a million faces
down there and they can't track them all.</i>

397
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:33,529
所以我们要找到我们可以信任的人
<i>So, we'll find people
we can trust.</i>

398
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:35,364
把朋友与他们的耳朵留意下面动静
<i>Friends with their ears
to the ground</i>

399
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:40,102
谁能帮助我们拿到的东西去反击
<i>who can help us get the things
we need to fight back.</i>

400
00:30:42,372 --> 00:30:43,505
我们将看他们怎么做
<i>We'll watch what they do.</i>

401
00:30:43,507 --> 00:30:46,041
了解他们的战术，和日常活动
<i>Study their tactics,
their routines.</i>

402
00:30:46,043 --> 00:30:48,846
我们了解的越多，就更容易击败他们
<i>The more we know, the easier
it will be to hurt them.</i>

403
00:30:51,114 --> 00:30:52,715
我们更需要智慧
<i>But we'll need to be smart.</i>

404
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:55,318
也需要有足够的耐心
<i>And we'll need to be patient.</i>

405
00:30:55,819 --> 00:30:58,087
我们将在我们的战略打击他们
<i>We'll hit them on our terms.</i>

406
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:00,623
一旦我们准备好
<i>When we're good and ready.</i>

407
00:31:06,964 --> 00:31:09,198
我们亲手解放我们的自由
<i>We inherited our freedom.</i>

408
00:31:11,467 --> 00:31:14,937
现在轮到我们所有人去争取它
<i>Now it's up to
all of us to fight for it.</i>

409
00:31:19,109 --> 00:31:20,576
这些都好劣质
These things are bad ass.

410
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:23,079
正如你说的。
Not if you know anything.

411
00:31:46,737 --> 00:31:49,005
我们需要更好地武器
We need to get better weapons.

412
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:53,609
你们的生活是我们最关心的。
<i>Your livelihood is our utmost concern.</i>

413
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:55,110
我们想要创建一个更好地世界
<i>We are creating a better world</i>

414
00:31:55,112 --> 00:31:59,515
那里你和你的家人会被更好地照顾
<i>where you and your family can be taken care of.</i>

415
00:32:36,353 --> 00:32:38,321
四十秒
Forty seconds.

416
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:41,557
拿上所有的武器和装甲
The weapons and ammo,
get it all.

417
00:32:55,906 --> 00:32:57,406
罗伯特，你还好吗？
Robert, you okay?

418
00:32:57,408 --> 00:32:59,208
没事
Yeah.

419
00:32:59,576 --> 00:33:01,277
我们走
Let's go.

420
00:33:29,306 --> 00:33:31,641
快，快！
Come on, come on!

421
00:33:35,712 --> 00:33:38,648
我们已经拿到我们需要的，走。
We've got what we need.
Let's go!

422
00:33:39,883 --> 00:33:41,217
我的天啊！
Holy shit!

423
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:44,787
嘿，杰德，这不是C4吗？
Hey, Jed.
Isn't this C4?

424
00:34:20,157 --> 00:34:21,123
我做不到。太傻×了
I can't. This is stupid.

425
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:25,494
你可以的。来，瞄准他就可以。
Yes, you can.
Come on, just sight it up.

426
00:34:27,264 --> 00:34:30,199
现在，向肩部后瞄准
Now, one shot,
behind the shoulder.

427
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,535
放轻松
Just relax.

428
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:35,404
呼气调整
Breathe out and squeeze.

429
00:34:37,841 --> 00:34:39,075
Shit.

430
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,444
你搞定它了
You got him.

431
00:35:00,063 --> 00:35:00,896
这是什么
What is this?

432
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:06,302
你喝血的拿铁咖啡,或鹿的精神,或一些什么别的？
You drink the blood latte, or
the deer's spirit, or some shit?

433
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:09,238
这不是什么别的，罗伯特
It's not "some shit," Robert.

434
00:35:09,406 --> 00:35:11,140
这是传统惯例，罗伯特
It's tradition, Robert.

435
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,875
喝了它
Drink up.

436
00:35:26,723 --> 00:35:28,958
老兄，其实喝起来好像没那么糟糕
Dude,it's not that bad actually.

437
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,626
不吗？
No?

438
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,928
喝起来什么味道？
What did it taste like?

439
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:33,462
那个，你懂得。
Well, you know.

440
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:37,199
见鬼，我们怎么会知道
- Hell, no, we don't.
我们从来没喝过那玩意
- We never drank that shit.

441
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,437
那太不安全了！
That can't be safe!

442
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,021
好了，大家都准备好了吗
Okay, you guys ready?

443
00:36:32,422 --> 00:36:34,123
感觉怎么样
How you feeling?

444
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:35,324
我不知道
I don't know.

445
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:37,593
好吧，大家。我也是同样的感觉
It's all right, man.
I feel the same way.

446
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:40,529
听着，我知道我们人数少而且枪支弹药也不多。
Look, I know we're outnumbered
and we're out-gunned.

447
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,132
但那不意味我们就不能成功
But that doesn't mean
we can't make a difference.

448
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,801
所以现在决定权在我们，让人们知道
So it's up to us
to let people know

449
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:47,937
战斗要开始了
that there is a fight on.

450
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,972
一场需要他们加入的战斗！
A fight that we need them
to join.

451
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:53,642
下面大部分的士兵，他们并不想呆在那
Most of those soldiers down
there, they don't want to be here.

452
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:55,644
所以我们要成功太艰难
So we have to make it too hard,

453
00:36:55,646 --> 00:37:00,149
会有更多的牺牲。
and too difficult and too
bloody for them to stay.

454
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:04,887
当我纵横四海是，我们是正义的一方。我们强制执行命令。
When I was overseas, we were
the good guys. We enforced order.

455
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,890
现在我们成了坏人
Now we're the bad guys

456
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,159
并且我们制造混乱
and we create chaos.

457
00:37:11,027 --> 00:37:12,494
我们想要创建一个更好地世界
<i>We are creating a better world</i>

458
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:15,864
那里你和你的家人会被更好地照顾
<i>where you and your family
can be taken care of.</i>

459
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:18,967
我们在这里为人民服务
<i>We are here to
serve the people.</i>

460
00:37:30,413 --> 00:37:32,381
快，快
Come on! Come on!

461
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:33,549
行动，我们走
Move! Let's go!

462
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:35,584
快，我们走
Come on, let's go.

463
00:37:49,699 --> 00:37:51,867
那是上尉
That's Captain Cho.

464
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,094
我们走
Let's go.

465
00:38:31,241 --> 00:38:33,576
好的，15秒
Okay, 15 seconds.

466
00:38:39,449 --> 00:38:40,816
他们是谁
Who are they?

467
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,618
投敌者
Collaborators.

468
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,353
必然发生的
Had to happen.

469
00:38:50,527 --> 00:38:53,262
好了，我们开始了，注意
Okay, here we go.
Look alive.

470
00:39:02,405 --> 00:39:03,906
嘿！
Hey!

471
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:05,574
嘿，派特！
Hey, Pete!

472
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:07,576
狼獾 队！
The Wolverines!

473
00:39:08,378 --> 00:39:10,479
是他们！...
It's the Wolverines...

474
00:39:46,449 --> 00:39:48,317
老兄
Dude.

475
00:39:51,321 --> 00:39:52,888
老兄！
Dude!

476
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:57,126
都不许动
Nobody move!

477
00:39:58,762 --> 00:40:01,029
三明治艺术品！把这东西填进面包咯！
Sandwich artist!
Fill this shit with bread!

478
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:03,365
什么样的？随便！只要不是干面包就行
- What kind?
- I don't care! Just no flat bread.

479
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:05,734
小麦的！蜂蜜燕麦！金枪鱼！火鸡！
Wheat! Honey oat!
Tuna! Turkey!

480
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:08,804
艹
Shit!

481
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:13,242
他们没看到我们吧？
Did they see us?

482
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,611
我不知道，快拿上食物
I don't know.
Just get the food.

483
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:17,646
快！准备食物！
Go! Get the food!

484
00:40:23,753 --> 00:40:26,221
下午好，爱国者们
<i>Good afternoon, patriots.</i>

485
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:28,490
这是美国无线电台
<i>This is Radio Free America.</i>

486
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:29,792
直播
<i>Broadcasting live</i>

487
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:31,460
占领这些区域
<i>to the occupied zone.</i>

488
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:33,462
哦，我的上帝，太好吃了
Oh, my God, that was good.

489
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:35,531
我怀念这味道
I missed this.

490
00:40:35,932 --> 00:40:37,933
你知道我还想念什么嘛？
You know what else I miss?

491
00:40:38,134 --> 00:40:39,335
披萨
Pizza.

492
00:40:39,337 --> 00:40:40,536
冲洗的厕所
Toilets that flush.

493
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:42,171
使命召唤:现代战争
<i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.</i>

494
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:44,106
老兄,我们生存在使命的召唤
<i>Dude, we're living Call of Duty.</i>

495
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,774
真是太差劲了
And it sucks.

496
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,143
你们都好逊阿
You guys are amateurs, man.

497
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:50,145
我想念女人
I miss girls.

498
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:51,714
不，不是你们这样的
No, not like you.

499
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:55,150
我喜欢火辣的，性感的
I mean like hot, sexy,

500
00:40:55,652 --> 00:40:57,486
丰满的女人
voluptuous girls.

501
00:40:57,488 --> 00:40:58,420
不错
Nice.

502
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:00,456
不会用AK（抢）的女人
Girls without AKs.

503
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,958
谁会需要AK？
Who needs AKs?

504
00:41:05,795 --> 00:41:06,628
马特
Matt.

505
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,331
来啊，老兄，说说你想念的？
Come on, bro,
what do you miss?

506
00:41:27,783 --> 00:41:30,952
你们的生活是我们最关系的
<i>Your livelihood is
our utmost concern.</i>

507
00:41:30,954 --> 00:41:35,156
我们想要创建一个更好地世界
那里你和你的家人...
<i>We are creating a better world
where you and your family...</i>

508
00:41:35,158 --> 00:41:38,393
你已经被美国的文化污染了
<i>You have been tainted by American culture.</i>

509
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:41,830
在正确的领导下，我们才能创造这个国家....
<i>With the right leadership,
we can make this country...</i>

510
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:45,934
你一直生活在一个伪装正义的土地上
<i>You have been living in a
disguised land of righteousness.</i>

511
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:51,139
你生活在一个隔离你去课堂的
<i>You live in a world that
segregates you into classes.</i>

512
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:52,874
我们是来帮忙的
<i>We are here to help.</i>

513
00:41:52,876 --> 00:41:55,076
对于百世纪
<i>For two-and-a-quarter centuries,</i>

514
00:41:55,078 --> 00:41:59,814
你已经生活在一个奴隶制的领域
<i>you have been
living in a realm of slavery.</i>

515
00:42:18,201 --> 00:42:20,569
不管我说的是只会使你生气。
Whatever I say is
just going to piss you off.

516
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:22,604
所以为什么我们不把它忘掉?
So why don't we just forget it?

517
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:24,373
忘记什么？
Forget what?

518
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,709
你已经把每个人都置身危险中？
That you've been putting
everyone here at risk?

519
00:42:28,511 --> 00:42:29,511
艾丽卡还在那，杰德
Erica's still out there, Jed.

520
00:42:29,513 --> 00:42:30,846
那如果你被抓了怎么办？
And what happens when you get caught?

521
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:32,981
因为如果换成我，你不回做事不管的对吗？
Because if it were me, you
wouldn't keep looking, right?

522
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:35,884
但这意味着要把其他人也置身危险
Not if it meant putting
everyone else's ass on the line.

523
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:38,253
我不是你，杰德。
- I'm not you, Jed.
不， 你不是
- No, you're not.

524
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:40,222
要以团队优先
The team has got to come first.

525
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,757
你要把它记在脑子里
Get that through your head.

526
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:43,992
艾丽卡是我的家人，杰德
Erica's my family, Jed.

527
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:45,928
对我来说，她比你更亲
She's more family
than you are.

528
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,529
是吗？
Yeah?

529
00:42:48,231 --> 00:42:50,699
你会害我们都被杀死了
You're going to
get us all killed.

530
00:42:58,141 --> 00:43:00,576
这就是你如何打败他们的办法
That's how you get Cho.

531
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:22,931
集会在中央广场下午两点开始
The rally is at 2:00
at the main square.

532
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,132
所以，做假目标，像以前一样。
So, decoy, like before.

533
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:26,869
一个小的汽车炸弹爆炸在这里。
A little car bomb goes off here.

534
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:29,371
清空群众，安全保卫的人从过去
The crowd clears,
security rushes in,

535
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:32,908
那就是当那个狗娘养的混蛋在舞台下时
and that is when Mr. Big-Ass Mother-F bomb under the stage

536
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:36,612
要打到这王八蛋去天国。
is going to blow that bastard to kingdom come.

537
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:44,019
我们不是你们的敌人

538
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:45,854
因为你们也是受害者
<i>Because you, too, are victims.</i>

539
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:50,425
美国这贪婪、不负责任文化的受害者　　
<i>Victims of an American culture
in which greed, irresponsibility</i>

540
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:53,528
而且诈骗被公开的鼓励
<i>and fraud were openly encouraged.</i>

541
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,330
受害者们因为政府的腐败
<i>Victims of a corrupt government</i>

542
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:58,500
与华尔街的暴君同流合污
<i>in bed with the tyrants of Wall Street.</i>

543
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:02,771
拥有正确的领导这是我们最诚挚的信念
<i>It is our sincerest belief
that with the right leadership</i>

544
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:04,305

545
00:44:04,307 --> 00:44:08,643
<i>this country will rise again,
better,</i>

546
00:44:08,645 --> 00:44:12,480
道德上优于和之前的样子
<i>morally superior to what was here before.</i>

547
00:44:12,615 --> 00:44:13,548
但我们需要你们的帮助
<i>But we need your help.</i>

548
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:19,621
我们的工程师团队,准备好了恢复电力和公用事业。
<i>We have teams of engineers ready
to restore power and utilities.</i>

549
00:44:19,623 --> 00:44:21,856
但是我们不能提供这些东西
<i>But we cannot provide
these things</i>

550
00:44:21,858 --> 00:44:23,425
除非情况稳定下来
<i>until the
situation stabilizes.</i>

551
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:27,863
我们都必须激发有政治意识的人
<i>We must all arouse the political
consciousness of the people.</i>

552
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,898
狗娘养的！
Son of a bitch!

553
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:30,465
什么？
What?

554
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:33,168
坐在Cho后面的，是俄罗斯的
The guy sitting behind Cho,
he's Russian.

555
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:33,936
你确定？
Are you serious?

556
00:44:33,938 --> 00:44:35,771
蓝色的贝雷帽意味着他是特种部队。
The blue beret
means he's Spetsnaz.

557
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:37,239
俄罗斯特种部队
Russian Special Forces.

558
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:38,040
他的专长是什么?
What's his specialty?

559
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:40,709
从反暴动开始
Counter-insurgency,
for starters.

560
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:41,977
他们在这里是因为我们吗？
Are they here because of us?

561
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:45,113
那个，如果是，那他们来的有点晚。
Well, if they are,
they're a little late.

562
00:44:48,651 --> 00:44:51,820
你必须远离这里。一些事即将发生
You got to get out of here.
Some shit is about to happen.

563
00:44:52,021 --> 00:44:55,424
那么州旗可以再次上升
<i>So the collective states
can rise again</i>

564
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:57,793
并且再次统一
<i>and stand united again.</i>

565
00:44:57,795 --> 00:45:03,098
我们来这里是为了促进这个重要的目标
<i>We are here to facilitate
this important objective...</i>

566
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,800
90秒
Ninety seconds.

567
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:09,971
...同时,一个新的社会和经济计划会被实施
<i>...while a new social and
economic initiative is implemented.</i>

568
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:13,074
现在,普通宵禁将从今晚开始
<i>Now, regular curfews
will commence tonight.</i>

569
00:45:13,076 --> 00:45:17,412
他们故意维护社会秩序
<i>They're designed
to preserve the social order.</i>

570
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:19,014
达利尔
Daryl.

571
00:45:21,684 --> 00:45:23,352
你没事吧？
You okay?

572
00:45:26,255 --> 00:45:28,090
没事
Yeah.

573
00:45:31,661 --> 00:45:35,196
但完全服从是强制性的
<i>But full compliance
is mandatory.</i>

574
00:45:35,198 --> 00:45:35,830
没有例外 

<i>No exceptions.</i>

575
00:45:35,832 --> 00:45:41,369
监管委员会已经暂停所有来访的时间
<i>The regulatory board has
suspended all visiting hours</i>

576
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:43,538
在美国工人的改革
<i>at the United Workers' Reform.</i>

577
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:49,377
因此，你们最好记在心上
<i>And so, it is with your well-being in mind</i>

578
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:50,779
我们要求你们配合工作
<i>that we ask
for your cooperation</i>

579
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:56,484
在把这些懦弱的狼獾恐怖分子绳之以法
<i>in bringing these cowardly
Wolverine terrorists to justice.</i>

580
00:45:57,387 --> 00:45:58,120
引爆它
Blow it.

581
00:45:58,122 --> 00:46:00,288
世界还没到
- It's not time yet.
离开引爆！
- Blow it now!

582
00:46:02,892 --> 00:46:05,494
不要开火，多生事端
Hold your fire.
Do not engage.

583
00:46:23,212 --> 00:46:24,179
艹
Shit.

584
00:46:25,382 --> 00:46:27,249
中埋伏了
Ambush!

585
00:46:29,852 --> 00:46:32,087
达利尔

钥匙在哪？钥匙在哪，宝贝？钥匙呢
Where's the key? Where's the
key, baby? Where's the key?

谢谢你

00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:33,528
保持冷静，我们就快到家了

丹尼，拿剪刀给我

612

from outside?

615
00:51:11,634 --> 00:51:14,402
噢，上帝，艾丽卡！

616
00:51:14,737 --> 00:51:17,739
嘿。如果是我我现在不会进去
Hey. I wouldn't go in there
right now.

617
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,975
为什么
- Why?
朱莉崩溃了
- Julie's freaking out.

618
00:51:19,977 --> 00:51:22,110

619
00:51:25,815 --> 00:51:28,149
当你决定独自离开
When you decided to run off

620
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:30,251
做自己的事的时候
and do your own thing,

621
00:51:30,453 --> 00:51:33,822
格雷格因为想去帮你被杀了

trying to help you.

622
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:52,841
这是几天前了

623

这些俄罗斯士兵来到体育场

他们不停的问我关于你们

who you guys knew

625
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:03,218
还有谁可能会帮助你们

626
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:05,353
他们还握有你们的名字清单
And they even had
a list of names.

627
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:08,089
杰德，我们所有的线人都在城里。我们不能...
Jed, all our contacts in town,
man. We can't...

628
00:52:08,091 --> 00:52:11,926
听着，我们不是救助站
Look, we are not a rescue unit.
We can't save everyone.

629
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:15,530
等等。所以我们不打算行动了？
Wait. So we're not
going to do anything?

630
00:52:20,202 --> 00:52:23,938
我没那么说吧，是吗？
I didn't say that, did I?

631
00:52:35,017 --> 00:52:36,017
你有罪
You are guilty

632
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:39,587
因为提供援助给狼獾恐怖分子。
of giving aid

633
00:52:55,704 --> 00:52:57,372
艹
Shit.

634
00:53:28,504 --> 00:53:32,907
狼獾！

636
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:37,679

Wolverines!

637
00:54:05,441 --> 00:54:08,810
马特已经走了好几天了

639
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:14,916
是，我知道
Yeah, I know.

640
00:55:11,073 --> 00:55:14,809
你在这干嘛，马特？
What are you doing here,

641
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:22,081
完成一切，确保弹药的干燥
Topping everything off.
Making sure the ammo's dry.

642
00:55:22,083 --> 00:55:24,118
这是好的。也是我们需要你的地方。
That's great. That's where
we need you. Off on your own,

643
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:25,636
我们真的要现在开始了，杰德？
- We really gonna do this now, Jed?
独自做你自己的事情
- doing your own thing.

644
00:55:25,637 --> 00:55:26,354
是，我们开始
Yeah, we are.

645
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:28,022
我没办法把她留在那里
I couldn't just
leave her there.

646
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:30,792
你离开了你的岗位
- You left your post.
那我他妈应该做些什么？
- What the hell else was I supposed to do?

647
00:55:30,794 --> 00:55:32,627
我需要知道，我可以指望你。
I need to know
I can count on you.

648
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:34,729
好吧，你不应该
Well, maybe you can't.

649
00:55:35,664 --> 00:55:37,732
你到底期望什么？
What did you expect?

650 
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:40,535
你觉得你是第一个有这种感觉的人？
You think you're
the first to feel this? 

651
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:44,372
看到最好的朋友被杀？
To see one of your friends
get killed?

652
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:45,039
这是战争
This is war.

653
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:48,009
所以擦干眼泪，给我滚回战斗中来。
So rub some dirt on it and
get your ass back in the fight.

654
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,777
算了吧，杰德
Spare me, Jed.

655
00:55:51,814 --> 00:55:54,182
我离开了三天

you left for six years. Right?

657
00:56:05,194 --> 00:56:06,861
记得
Yeah.

658
00:56:09,498 --> 00:56:12,533
是的，马特，你说的对
Yeah, Matty, you're right.

659
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:19,073
我很混乱。我在你最需要我的时候留下你一人
I messed up. I left you right
when you needed me the most.

660
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:24,379
我很抱歉
And I'm sorry.

661
00:56:26,548 --> 00:56:29,951
我需要你比那时的我坚强
I need you to be
stronger than I was.

662
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:32,854
妈妈和爸爸都去世了现在
- Mom and Dad are both gone.
闭嘴，杰德
- Shut up, Jed.

663
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:33,488
现在只剩我们了
It's just us.

664
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:38,593
在这个集体里所有人，如果我失去你...
And more than anyone else in
the group, if I don't have you...

665
00:56:50,339 --> 00:56:53,608
好吧，做你想做的
Okay. Do what you want.

666
00:57:03,218 --> 00:57:06,854
致在洪堡抵抗的战士们

668
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:12,927
<i>The chair is against the wall.</i>

<i>And for the Wolverines

<i>Keep up the pressure,patriots.</i>

672
00:57:47,731 --> 00:57:50,798
狼獾，亲啊
Wolverines, baby.

673
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,468
狼獾
Wolverines.

674
00:58:03,812 --> 00:58:06,647
挺美的，哈？
It's beautiful, huh?

675
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:08,416
非常
Very.

676
00:58:09,485 --> 00:58:14,389
真希望在这里可以不要想着劳里・斯图尔特
I wish I could look at it without
thinking of Laurie Stewart.

677
00:58:14,391 --> 00:58:15,790
什么？
What?

678
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:18,159
劳里・斯图尔特
Laurie Stewart.

679
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,093
谁？
Who?

680
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:21,763
露营？阵亡将士纪念日的周末吗?
Camping?
Memorial Day weekend?

681
00:58:21,765 --> 00:58:23,197
完全不知道你在说什么
I have no idea
what you're talking about...

682
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:26,601
我们在这里烧烤，而我以食物中毒结束
We had that huge barbecue and I
ended up getting food poisoning,

683
00:58:26,603 --> 00:58:28,569
所以我是在我的帐篷，吐了整晚,
so I was in and out of my tent
all night puking,

684
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:32,807
那是当我看到你们两个一起快速躲进湖中
and that's when I saw the two of
you ducking into the lake together.

685
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:36,711
噢，那个劳里・斯图尔特
- Oh, that Laurie Stewart.
噢，对，就是那个
- Oh, yeah, that one.

686
00:58:39,415 --> 00:58:40,882
哦，老兄
Oh, man.

687
00:58:40,884 --> 00:58:43,651
你知道，她接吻技术不错
You know,
she was a good kisser.

688
00:58:43,653 --> 00:58:46,621
她闻起来像Aqua Net
- She smelled like Aqua Net.
什么？
- What?

689
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:48,055
头发定型剂
Hairspray.

690
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:50,124
是这样啊
Shit, that's right.

691
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:51,292
她那可怕的发型。
She had that terrible haircut.

692
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:54,362
那个我立刻复制并穿梭整个中学
The one that I immediately copied
and wore all through middle school,

693
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,030
但是，你从未注意到
which you never noticed,
by the way.

694
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:58,966
不，我注意到了。太可怕了
No, I noticed.
It was awful.

695
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:13,648
噢，艹。快走
Oh, shit.
Go, go!

696
00:59:17,252 --> 00:59:19,720
快快快！
Go! Go! Go!

697
00:59:20,122 --> 00:59:23,257
呆在里面更安全！不我就要呆在这里
We're safer inside!
No way I'm staying in here!

698
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:40,475
朱莉？朱莉？
Julie? Julie?

699
00:59:41,176 --> 00:59:41,909
朱莉！
Julie!

700
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:45,112
丹尼？丹尼？
- Danny? Danny?
罗伯特，她死了
- Robert, she's gone.

701
00:59:45,114 --> 00:59:47,148
我们得离开，他死了
- We gotta go. He's gone.
丹尼！
- Danny!

702
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:48,649
达利尔，达利尔？你能听到我说话吗？
Daryl? Daryl?
Can you hear me?

703
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:52,954
快，我们得离开。拿上你的武器
Come on, we gotta go.
We gotta go. Grab your weapon.

704
00:59:53,589 --> 00:59:56,324
快走，快
Let's move, come on.

705
01:00:14,309 --> 01:00:15,743
跑
Run.

706
01:00:15,745 --> 01:00:18,646
快走，马特，马特，快
Let's go, Matty.
Matty, come on!

707
01:00:40,769 --> 01:00:42,169
我得停下
I gotta stop.

708
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:43,538
快
Come on.

709
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:46,007
你可以的，我来帮你
You can do it.
I'll help you.

710
01:00:46,074 --> 01:00:48,576
我帮你
I got it.

711
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:50,278
我们走
Let's go.

712
01:00:52,548 --> 01:00:54,215
我们走
Let's go.

713
01:01:06,862 --> 01:01:08,963
给你
Here.

714
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:29,483
杰德
Jed?

715
01:01:33,789 --> 01:01:36,657
你该试着睡一会
You should try to
get some sleep.

716
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:38,859
我没事
I'm okay.

717
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:43,798
你知道，这是...
You know,
this was...

718
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:47,501
这是迟早要发生的，早晚而已
This was bound to happen,
sooner or later.

719
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:49,503
是的
Yeah.

720
01:01:53,709 --> 01:01:57,211
我说的是这个团体，杰德
I was talking to the group,
Jed.

721
01:02:03,418 --> 01:02:04,852
他们会开始有疑问
They're starting
to question everything.

722
01:02:04,854 --> 01:02:09,457
他们没有说过会推出，但是...
Nobody's saying
they want to quit, but...

723
01:02:09,791 --> 01:02:11,759
什么？
Yeah?

724
01:02:13,395 --> 01:02:16,530
你怎么想，马特？
What do you think, Matty?

725
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:28,509
Rub some dirt on it.

726
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:39,947
你是谁？
Who are you?

727
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:42,783
你可能会先回答这个问题
You might want to
answer that first.

728
01:03:42,785 --> 01:03:47,621
让我们放下武器，然后我们摘下面具
Let's put down those weapons.
Then we can lose the masks.

729
01:03:51,126 --> 01:03:53,894
我们到卷入进什么狗屎节目了？
What kind of shit-show did we drop into?

730
01:03:54,696 --> 01:03:58,466
军士长安德鲁・坦纳。海军陆战队
Sergeant Major Andrew Tanner.
Marine Corps.

731
01:03:58,468 --> 01:03:59,567
我们是阿尔法连队
We're Alpha Company.

732
01:03:59,569 --> 01:04:01,335
最近联合国退休
Recently un-retired.

733
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:02,770
哪里？
Out of where?

734
01:04:02,772 --> 01:04:03,771
Camp Pendleton.

735
01:04:03,773 --> 01:04:06,040
当有一个彭德尔顿军营时候
When there was a Camp Pendleton.

736
01:04:06,042 --> 01:04:08,476
现在我们是一部分美国游击军队。
Now we're part of the Free American Army.

737
01:04:08,478 --> 01:04:10,244
3个人？
Three guys?

738
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:11,545
没了？
That's it?

739
01:04:11,547 --> 01:04:12,813
三个人怎么了？
What good are three guys?

740
01:04:12,815 --> 01:04:14,415
Hey, shit-for-brains.

741
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:15,382
你和一个美国海军顶嘴
You're sassing a United States Marine.

742
01:04:15,384 --> 01:04:20,187
好吧,听着,我们试图在这片区域联系一群叛乱分子。
All right, look, we're trying to link up 
with a group of insurgents working the area.

743
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:21,756
他们叫狼獾
Call themselves Wolverines.

744
01:04:21,758 --> 01:04:25,059
你听说过他们？
- You ever hear of them?
是的，我们听说过
- Yeah, we've heard of them.

745
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:26,026
你们来这里帮助他们？
You here to help them out?

746
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:31,165
不，实际上我们希望他们能帮我们
No. Actually, we were hoping
they could help us out.

747
01:04:34,436 --> 01:04:36,370
我们在这里下方扎营。
We're camped just below here.

748
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:37,505
我们有水和干净的绷带
We got clean water
and bandages

749
01:04:37,507 --> 01:04:40,274
另一个营地距离这里六英里
and another camp
about six miles west of here.

750
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:43,677
等我们吃过东西后，再试试前进。
We were gonna try and push on 
after we ate.

751
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:46,614
我们就是狼獾
We're the Wolverines.

752
01:04:52,154 --> 01:04:54,421
我就怕是
I was afraid of that.

753
01:04:55,423 --> 01:05:00,361
我们怎么会在这里? 发生了什么,我们的防守吗?
So how did we get here?
What happened to our defense?

754
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:01,762
已经去过了
It went defunct.

755
01:05:01,764 --> 01:05:02,830
Shit-ified.

756
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:04,231
有一种新型武器
There's a new class of weapon.

757
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:06,600
它能引起巨大的电脉冲
It caused
a massive electrical pulse.

758
01:05:06,602 --> 01:05:09,436
一切都会脱离,再也无法还原。
Everything went off-line
and never came back.

759
01:05:09,438 --> 01:05:10,704
网格都被烧了,潜艇淹死
Grids fried, subs drowned.

760
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:14,275
他们以打压城市用非核武器弹头的战术结束
They mopped up by hitting cities
with tactical non-nuke warheads

761
01:05:14,277 --> 01:05:18,379
降落地面的部队，战略上他们需要被引领
and landed ground troops where
they needed strategic pressure.

762
01:05:18,381 --> 01:05:19,513
那些俄罗斯人呢？
What about the Russians?

763
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:21,448
艹，他们得到了整个东部沿海地区。
Shit, they got the
whole Eastern seaboard.

764
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:23,717
我们知道他们提供硬件和飞机,
We know they supplied hardware and aircraft,

765
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:27,288
但朝鲜锁定西北太平洋。
but North Korea locked down
the Pacific Northwest.

766
01:05:28,223 --> 01:05:29,590
所以，都完了？
So it's over?

767
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:31,158
完了？
Over?

768
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,260
那这是什么？
What is this?

769
01:05:33,562 --> 01:05:34,028
一个步枪
A rifle.

770
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:38,599
那就对了，孩子。一名海军陆战队员和他的步枪
That's right, motard.
A marine and his rifle.

771
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:41,635
这是世界上用来打击敌人的不二武器。
It's the baddest shit-kicking 
weapon in the world.

772
01:05:41,637 --> 01:05:46,073
我还有一息尚存，所以就不会完
And I'm still breathing,
so it ain't over.

773
01:05:46,075 --> 01:05:46,841
远着呢
Far from it.

774
01:05:46,843 --> 01:05:49,543
我们的幸运,他们掌握的超过他们了能力范围。
Lucky for us, they bit off
more than they could chew.

775
01:05:49,545 --> 01:05:52,613
这个国家的其他部分还是自由的并准备为之而战。
A lot of this country is
still free and up for a fight.

776
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:53,080
Hoorah.

777
01:05:53,082 --> 01:05:55,749
密歇根到蒙大拿,阿拉巴马州到亚利桑那州
Michigan to Montana,
Alabama to Arizona,

778
01:05:55,751 --> 01:05:57,785
都还是自由的美国。现在
that's still free America
right now.

779
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:00,554
我们距离边境只有50到60英里
We're only 50,
60 miles from the border.

780
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:01,255
就是这样
That's right.

781
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:03,791
而其他地方,也会运用我们的方式。
And other places, too,swinging back our way.

782
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,226
完全开放的热战在佛罗里达州。
Wide-open shooting war in Florida.

783
01:06:05,228 --> 01:06:08,829
德州墨西哥边境也已经开战了数周。
Texas-Mexican border
has been burning for weeks.

784
01:06:08,831 --> 01:06:12,066
就因为有你们这样的人
All because of folks like you.

785
01:06:13,001 --> 01:06:16,503
你们改变了，见鬼，你...
You've made a difference.
Hell, you...

786
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:19,073
你们已经改变了。
You are the difference.

787
01:06:23,078 --> 01:06:23,677
那么我们能做些什么？
So how can we help?

788
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:28,115
我们不能理解的是,为什么他们不受自己武器的损害。
What we can't figure out is how come 
they're not crippled by their own weapon.

789
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:31,752
你们见过他们用这东西吗？
You guys ever see them
using something like this?

790
01:06:33,188 --> 01:06:36,123
嘿，马特，你的手机还能用吗
Hey, Matt,
is your phone still working?

791
01:06:52,908 --> 01:06:55,442
第一关,狼獾队
<i>Semper Fi, Wolverines.</i>

792
01:06:55,844 --> 01:06:56,377
那是什么
What is it?

793
01:06:56,379 --> 01:07:02,049
这就是他们如何互相通话，一个关闭式的网络通讯
It's how they talk to each other.
A closed network for communication.

794
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:03,817
所以无法被黑客入侵
So it can't be hacked.

795
01:07:03,819 --> 01:07:04,818
但如果我们搞到它
But if we had it,

796
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:08,589
这将是我们需要的立足点来赶走他们
it'd be the foothold we need
to start pushing them out

797
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:11,058
然后夺回我们的家园
and take our homes back.

798
01:07:12,894 --> 01:07:15,195
你想去把它偷出来？
And you want to steal it?

799
01:07:15,764 --> 01:07:17,431
立即马上
Rapidly.

800
01:07:40,021 --> 01:07:42,623
你还好吗
- You good?
没事
- Yeah.

801
01:07:51,266 --> 01:07:55,269
他们已经加强了警察局所有四个侧面
They've fortified the police station
with bunkers on all four sides.

802
01:07:55,271 --> 01:07:57,805
几个移动结构作为军营
A couple of mobile structures
acting as barracks

803
01:07:57,807 --> 01:07:59,540
那里藏着备用人员。
that house the
off-duty personnel.

804
01:07:59,542 --> 01:08:03,444
里面每次至少有20人
There is at least 20 guys
in there at any one time.

805
01:08:03,446 --> 01:08:04,311
还有大量的活力
And a ton of firepower.

806
01:08:04,313 --> 01:08:07,081
我有一个简讯给你。没有办法进去。
I got a news flash for you.
There's no way in there.

807
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,315
噢，那有一个
Oh, there's one.

808
01:08:08,317 --> 01:08:10,451
什么，我们跳？
What, we jump?

809
01:08:10,453 --> 01:08:11,452
是啊，那就是计划
Yeah, that's the plan.

810
01:08:11,454 --> 01:08:15,856
那不是计划，那是TM三明治不带面包
That's not a plan.
That's a shit sandwich without the bread.

811
01:08:15,924 --> 01:08:17,624
掩护我
Cover me.

812
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:21,695
艹
Shit!

813
01:08:29,404 --> 01:08:31,305
讨厌死这些孩子们了
I hate these kids.

814
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:33,741
太讨厌了
Hate 'em.

815
01:08:46,654 --> 01:08:48,722
我操
Son of a bitch!

816
01:08:59,868 --> 01:09:02,302
霍奇斯，你跟我。史密斯，你守在这里
Hodges, you're with me.
Smith, you grow roots up here.

817
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:05,572
你一旦听到像是美国人被放倒了
You hear anything that sounds 
like Americans getting their asses kicked,

818
01:09:05,574 --> 01:09:09,510
你一定要确保那些女孩知道什么时候轮到自己
you make damn sure those girls 
know when it's their turn to dance.

819
01:09:09,512 --> 01:09:12,646
谁猜一下那小绿盒子在哪？
Any guesses where
that little green box is?

820
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:14,515
有阿
Yeah.

821
01:09:14,517 --> 01:09:17,051
我们打算跟着电线走
We're gonna follow the wire.

822
01:09:58,293 --> 01:10:00,627
蹲下蹲下蹲下
Down! Down! Down!

823
01:10:03,031 --> 01:10:06,400
欢迎来到敌营，孩子们
Welcome to shit's creek,
motards.

824
01:10:18,546 --> 01:10:19,413
接下来
All right.

825
01:10:19,415 --> 01:10:22,649
电线从这里分成三路
Our wire just split into
three different directions.

826
01:10:22,651 --> 01:10:23,717
一点也不见到
Nothing's easy.

827
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:24,518
好吧，计划一下
All right, here's the plan.
  
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:29,189
你们俩从备用楼梯走。跟着线到楼下
You two, take the back stairs. Follow
the line down to the ground floor.

829
01:10:29,191 --> 01:10:32,059
杰德，马特和你留守这里，跟着另外两个
Jed, Matt, you stay up here,
trace the other two.

830
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:35,362
霍奇斯你跟着我。我们去守着前门
Hodges, you're with me. We're
going to secure the front door.

831
01:10:35,364 --> 01:10:39,433
我们去找那东西然后撤退
Let's find this thing 
and get back to the hood.

832
01:10:39,435 --> 01:10:42,069
今天是个光荣的日子，先生们
It's a good day to die,
gentlemen.

833
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:43,203
他说了什么？
What did he say?

834
01:10:43,205 --> 01:10:48,675
别纠结。海军陆战队员不会死。
他们去了地狱还会重新编队
Don't worry about it. Marines don't
die. They just go to hell and regroup.

835
01:10:49,544 --> 01:10:51,278
他到底说什么了
What did he say?

836
01:11:10,665 --> 01:11:12,199
没问题
Clear.

837
01:11:28,149 --> 01:11:31,985
老兄，他们不会让他们那玩意藏在该死的沙发里!
Dude, they're not gonna keep their
uber box under the frigging couch!

838
01:11:31,987 --> 01:11:32,653
你怎么知道
How do you know?

839
01:11:32,655 --> 01:11:36,723
这是一条重要的军事设备，不是你的色情储备
It's a vital piece of military
equipment, not your porn stash.

840
01:11:37,392 --> 01:11:39,226
你先来
You got this.

841
01:12:01,449 --> 01:12:03,951
我跟的线连到Cho的办公室里
My wire goes to Cho's office.

842
01:12:03,953 --> 01:12:07,254
他的房间...艹！
And he's home... Shit!

843
01:12:13,027 --> 01:12:15,762
找点乐子吧。
This is about to get interesting.

844
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:17,464
马特，你在哪？
Matty, where are you?

845
01:12:37,151 --> 01:12:39,019
Smith，到你了
Smith, you're on.

846
01:12:40,355 --> 01:12:43,690
来吧，女士们，展现你们男人的一面
C'mon, ladies,
show us your guns.

847
01:13:05,113 --> 01:13:06,513
见鬼！
Shit!

848
01:13:07,415 --> 01:13:08,749
快！
Come on!

849
01:13:24,132 --> 01:13:26,500
我们得离开这
We gotta get out of here!

850
01:13:28,169 --> 01:13:29,803
快
Run!

851
01:13:38,813 --> 01:13:40,714
他刚刚就在这
He was just here.

852
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:53,193
别让他们靠近盒子
Keep them away from the box.

853
01:14:11,145 --> 01:14:12,879
见鬼！
Shit!

854
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:21,221
别做梦了！
Not gonna happen.

855
01:14:50,084 --> 01:14:51,885
手榴弹！
Grenade!

856
01:15:05,533 --> 01:15:07,100
坦纳
Tanner!

857
01:16:11,933 --> 01:16:14,901
把那东西拿出去，我来掩护
- Get that thing out of here. I'll cover.
不，我不会独自离开
- No, I'm not leaving you.

858
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:19,172
见鬼该死的，马特。快把那玩意拿出去，快！
God damn it, Matty.
Get that thing out of here. Go!

859
01:17:32,346 --> 01:17:34,648
马特 艾克特！
Matt Eckert!

860
01:17:55,069 --> 01:17:58,204
你惹上不该惹得家族了
You fucked with the wrong family.

861
01:18:01,275 --> 01:18:03,777
把这东西拿出去，罗伯特
Get this out of here, Robert.

862
01:18:08,482 --> 01:18:10,317
盒子在哪？
Where's the box?

863
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:11,017
它很安全
It's safe.

864
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:14,387
好了，我们走吧
All right,
let's get out of here.

865
01:18:24,565 --> 01:18:25,365
伤口太深
It's pretty deep.

866
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:29,436
是啊，不过一点也不疼，没事
Yeah, but it doesn't hurt.
It's okay.

867
01:18:30,137 --> 01:18:32,005
嘿
Hey.

868
01:18:49,991 --> 01:18:51,891
嘿
Hey.

869
01:18:58,199 --> 01:18:59,866
我没事
I'm okay.

870
01:19:06,374 --> 01:19:08,775
我一会就来
I'll be right there.

871
01:19:11,078 --> 01:19:13,279
抵押
Collateral.

872
01:19:19,253 --> 01:19:22,022
嘿，我能跟你聊两句吗
Hey, can I talk to you
for a second?

873
01:19:22,024 --> 01:19:24,290
当然，没问题
Yeah. Sure.

874
01:19:27,695 --> 01:19:29,863
怎么了？
What's up?

875
01:19:29,865 --> 01:19:31,731
没事，我...
Nothing. I...

876
01:19:31,733 --> 01:19:35,769
我只是在想，你知道...
I was just thinking,
you know, and...

877
01:19:37,738 --> 01:19:40,674
我不是很擅长这个，老兄
I'm not very good at this,
man.

878
01:19:40,676 --> 01:19:42,575
擅长什么
Good at what?

879
01:19:45,446 --> 01:19:49,449
给你些支持当你应得的时候。
Giving you props
when you get it right.

880
01:19:50,618 --> 01:19:53,653
然后让你知道
And letting you know that

881
01:19:53,888 --> 01:19:56,456
我为你骄傲
I'm proud of you.

882
01:20:04,932 --> 01:20:05,799
是啊
Yeah.

883
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:08,902
是的，杰德。那不是你的专长
Yes, Jed. That's not one
of your strengths.

884
01:20:08,904 --> 01:20:13,106
对
- No.
对，它不是我专长
- No, it's not.

885
01:20:21,182 --> 01:20:25,385
那么，现在喝一杯？
So, how about that beer now?

886
01:20:30,624 --> 01:20:32,492
哇
Wow.

887
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:35,428
我的第一次
My first one.

888
01:20:39,133 --> 01:20:41,701
你的呢
Where's yours?

889
01:20:41,902 --> 01:20:44,337
她偷走了
She stole it from me.

890
01:20:45,673 --> 01:20:47,540
去拿过来
Go get it.

891
01:21:05,726 --> 01:21:08,962
马特！小心后面
Matt! Watch the back!

892
01:21:19,507 --> 01:21:22,475
坦纳，掩护我
Tanner! Cover me!

893
01:21:25,746 --> 01:21:27,313
罗伯特，带艾丽卡逃出去
Robert,get Erica out of here.

894
01:21:27,315 --> 01:21:29,949
我不会留你独自一人
- I'm not leaving without you!
见鬼，照我说的做，罗伯特
- God damn it, do what I say, Robert!

895
01:21:29,951 --> 01:21:33,119
即使你击中甲板,也请注意后面。
When you hit the deck,watch your ass.

896
01:21:34,622 --> 01:21:36,823
我会赶上的，快！
I'll catch up. Go!

897
01:21:43,831 --> 01:21:46,566
救我！杰德！
Help me! Jed!

898
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:49,536
快，托尼
- Come on, Toni.
我们不能把他丢下
- We can't leave him!

899
01:21:49,538 --> 01:21:50,103
快
Come on!

900
01:21:50,105 --> 01:21:52,905
见鬼，托尼。我们需要你回归战斗
God damn it, Toni. We
need you back in the fight.

901
01:21:52,907 --> 01:21:56,810
快！我知道我知道。坦纳！我们走你那边吗？
Come on! I know. I know. Tanner!
Can we get out your way?

902
01:21:56,812 --> 01:21:57,911
赶快了
Make it quick.

903
01:21:57,913 --> 01:22:00,046
快快快快！
Go, go, go, go!

904
01:22:01,515 --> 01:22:03,917
速度速度！
Move your asses!

905
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:15,094
我们走
Let's go!

906
01:22:23,370 --> 01:22:25,171
史密斯
Smith!

907
01:23:19,393 --> 01:23:21,694
他们怎么找到的？
How did they know?

908
01:23:24,231 --> 01:23:27,066
他们怎么找到我们的，老兄？
How did they know
where we were, bro?

909
01:23:27,068 --> 01:23:29,435
他们肯定跟踪我们了
- They must have followed us.
不可能
- No.

910
01:23:29,437 --> 01:23:31,638
他们不可能跟踪的到我们
No way they could track us.

911
01:23:39,513 --> 01:23:41,948
达利尔，脱掉你的外套
Daryl, lift up your jacket.

912
01:23:42,616 --> 01:23:45,184
让我看看，给我看
Let me see this.
Let me see it.

913
01:23:46,987 --> 01:23:49,188
噢，见鬼
Oh, shit.

914
01:23:49,256 --> 01:23:51,124
那是什么
What is it?

915
01:23:51,126 --> 01:23:53,026
这不是个刀伤
It's not a knife wound.

916
01:23:53,761 --> 01:23:54,961
他们标记了什么东西
They tagged him
with something.

917
01:23:54,963 --> 01:23:57,797
就像对动物那样
Like what they do
with animals.

918
01:23:58,065 --> 01:23:59,165
什么？
What?

919
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:01,234
他们跟踪他？
They're tracking him?

920
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:03,536
达利尔
Daryl.

921
01:24:03,538 --> 01:24:04,237
你...
You...

922
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:05,538
不
- No.
你引导他们找到我们
- You led them right to us.

923
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:09,676
我不知道
- I didn't know!
你引导他们找到我们
- You led them right to us!

924
01:24:09,678 --> 01:24:11,678
快走
Let go!

925
01:24:12,012 --> 01:24:14,080
你杀了杰德
You killed Jed!

926
01:24:15,816 --> 01:24:18,718
马特，他杀了杰德
Matty, he killed Jed.

927
01:24:26,794 --> 01:24:30,430
你可以从他身上去除是吗，罗伯特？
You can cut it out of him,
right, Robert? Cut it out of him.

928
01:24:30,432 --> 01:24:32,332
不可能。用什么把它弄出来？
There's no way. With what?

929
01:24:32,334 --> 01:24:34,233
马特，我们得离开
Matt, we got to move.

930
01:24:34,235 --> 01:24:35,635
我们先回到车上
Let's just get back
in the car.

931
01:24:35,637 --> 01:24:38,404
我们继续前行。
- Let's keep going.
我们不能
- We can't.

932
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:40,873
他们会找到我们
They'll find us.

933
01:24:40,875 --> 01:24:43,609
我们还能怎么做？
What else are we
supposed to do?

934
01:24:51,986 --> 01:24:53,619
罗伯特
Robert.

935
01:24:53,621 --> 01:24:56,255
弄些齿轮
Get me some gear.

936
01:24:56,257 --> 01:24:56,756
什么？
What?

937
01:24:56,758 --> 01:24:59,525
他们随时可能赶到
They could be here any minute.

938
01:25:05,099 --> 01:25:06,866
达利尔
Daryl.

939
01:25:18,679 --> 01:25:20,913
我能借用你的枪吗？
Can I borrow your SAW?

940
01:26:14,401 --> 01:26:18,838
所以任何人想搭车回到自由的土地吗?
So anyone want a lift back
to the land of the free?

941
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:21,808
我们有足够的房间
We got plenty of room.

942
01:26:22,609 --> 01:26:25,511
我感到很抱歉你死去的弟兄了
I'm sorry for the loss
of your men.

943
01:26:25,513 --> 01:26:28,181
我们都会失去些什么，马特
We've all lost something,
Matt.

944
01:26:29,950 --> 01:26:32,051
你很了不起
You've done enough.

945
01:26:32,853 --> 01:26:36,255
你已经做得够多了
You've done more than enough.

946
01:26:36,723 --> 01:26:39,392
我很欣赏这一点
I appreciate that.

947
01:26:45,399 --> 01:26:47,800
事实上
The fact is

948
01:26:48,836 --> 01:26:51,404
我们没做太糟
we're not doing too bad

949
01:26:51,406 --> 01:26:54,240
对于一群小孩来说
for a bunch of kids.

950
01:26:54,242 --> 01:26:55,708
我们会继续战斗
We're going to fight.

951
01:26:55,710 --> 01:27:00,113
我们会继续战斗因为它变容易了
And we're going to keep
fighting because it's easier now.

952
01:27:00,115 --> 01:27:02,482
而且我们习惯了
And we're used to it.

953
01:27:02,484 --> 01:27:06,619
其余的你们要做一个很难的选择。
The rest of you are going to
have a tougher choice.

954
01:27:06,621 --> 01:27:10,523
因为我们不会强迫你们
Because we're not
going to sell it to you.

955
01:27:10,525 --> 01:27:13,459
现实太丑陋
It's too ugly for that.

956
01:27:13,461 --> 01:27:15,628
但当你在自己的后院打仗
But when you're fighting
in your own backyard,

957
01:27:15,630 --> 01:27:19,499
当你为了家庭而奋斗
when you're fighting
for your family,

958
01:27:19,501 --> 01:27:22,335
伤害就感觉少一点
it all hurts a little less

959
01:27:22,669 --> 01:27:25,605
反而更有意义
and makes a little more sense.

960
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:32,178
因为对他们来说,这仅仅是一个地方
<i>Because for them,
this is just a place.</i>

961
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:36,215
但对我们来说，是家园
<i>But for us,
this is our home.</i>

962
01:27:36,217 --> 01:27:38,417
狼獾队
Wolverines!

963
01:27:38,419 --> 01:27:39,752
狼獾队
Wolverines!

964
01:27:39,754 --> 01:27:41,787
狼獾队
Wolverines!

965
01:27:42,754 --> 01:27:45,787
