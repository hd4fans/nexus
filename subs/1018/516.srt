00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,300
BOSTON HARBOR
DECEMBER 16. 1773

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's go, let's go!

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,000
Redcoats! Redcoats are coming!

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,900
Stop in the name of the throne!

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,700
You're certain this is the right place?

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,800
Quite certain, Captain.

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,700
Secure that door. What door?

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,200
Man the door. Sir... with all due respect...

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,500
General Washington's orders were firm.

10
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,400
Bring back the crate and you. Alive.

11
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,200
- Man the door. - Captain, this way.

12
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,400
In the name of the Virginia militia, we claim this cargo.

13
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,300
Step aside.

14
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,400
O MIGHTY LOARD DEATH,

15
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,800
BY WHOM ALL THINGS ARE SET FREE,

16
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,900
I CAST MYSELF UTTERLY INTO THINE ARMS...

17
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,000
AND PLACE MY SELF UNRESERVEDLY UNDER THY
ALL POWERFUL PROTECTION.

18
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,100
?????

19
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,800
Surviving death, separated by time, tests the bonds of love.

20
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,700
The moment I saw her, I knew the bravest love is born again with each new day.

21
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,400
The kind of love that makes the mundane a marvel,

22
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,200
that bewilders with its magnificence.

23
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,200
Until fate's cruel hand intervened.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And in the blink of an eye, Katrina was lost to me.

25
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,100
I am so, so sorry.

26
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:57,800
I offer this tale, no matter how cruelly he may have treated you, to suggest that you do not give up.

27
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,900
Nor give into anything less than certainty in matters of the heart.

28
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,500
No one's ever s-said it like that.

29
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,100
Thank you.

30
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,200
It is I who should thank you, kind woman,

31
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,000
for unlocking this vehicle from afar.

32
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,500
And...

33
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,700
showing me how the entertainment system operates.

34
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,700
Farewell, Yolanda.

35
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,100
Thank you for calling NorthStar Assistance.

36
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,100
Crane. Jenny escaped.

37
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,700
You want me to call off the search

38
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,500
and give your sister a head start?

39
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,300
I'm asking you to give me a head start so this doesn't escalate.

40
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,500
She's been here a year and a half with a release in six months.

41
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,000
Why risk everything now without a good reason?

42
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,500
You're attributing reason?

43
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,900
Jenny's psych reports characterize her as disciplined and methodical.

44
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,000
Jenny does not do random.

45
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,800
Then for my money, that makes her even scarier.

46
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,200
You come visit your sister yesterday,

47
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,400
Crane talks to her for all of five minutes,

48
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,900
and tonight she escapes.

49
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,400
What the hell did you say to her?

50
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,000
I merely informed the lady there'd been a series of murders in Sleepy Hollow,

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,800
and she might be helpful to our investigation.

52
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,400
Well, that is just great.

53
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,900
My opinion, though admittedly not a professional one, is that Miss Jennifer Mills

54
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,900
is a brilliant misunderstood woman,

55
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,700
haunted by a past she's struggling to understand.

56
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,600
Yet her past is precisely what makes her valuable to us.

57
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,900
Due respect, Crane,

58
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,900
if I were her, you're the last guy I'd want vouching for my sanity.

59
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,900
Sir, you want facts.

60
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,000
We've had four dead bodies in two weeks.

61
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,500
That is a disturbing average by anyone's count.

62
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,300
And all of them barely explainable.

63
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,200
And how does this relate to your sister's escape?

64
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,500
I don't know.

65
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,400
But it does. And enough to make her run.

66
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,200
That is why you need me.

67
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,300
If I can get her to tell us what she thinks is happening here,

68
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,800
maybe we can get ahead of this.

69
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,500
I just need you to buy me a little bit of time.

70
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,800
You got 12 hours.

71
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,000
Then she's on a nationwide warrant.

72
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,400
I think you earned this.

73
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,100
I need my things, Wendel. Sure.

74
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,800
Been burning a hole in my safe since you left it.

75
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,400
Thanks, I owe you one.

76
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,800
You owe me nothing.

77
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,900
Except an explanation would be nice.

78
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,000
Remember when I told you one day this town was gonna go straight to hell?

79
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,700
I hate being right.

80
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,500
Left hand down.

81
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,200
Always the left hand will save you.

82
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,500
Please continue from here... The ninth measure.

83
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,100
Jennifer Mills has escaped.

84
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,800
We have reason to believe she knows where item 37 is located.

85
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,200
You will find her and then retrieve item 37.

86
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,300
A cleanup crew will arrive to assist your search.

87
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,500
They have a list of her known associates.

88
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,400
Hang up if you understand.

89
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,600
Can I help you?

90
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,100
My associates and I seek a woman

91
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,700
who may have entered your establishment, yes?

92
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,300
Jennifer Mills?

93
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,600
Never heard of her, fella.

94
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,400
A lot of women come in here.

95
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,500
You guys got to go.

96
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,100
Lies require commitment, Mr. Clark.

97
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,300
Are you quite certain you're committed to your course?

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,700
I assure you I am.

99
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,700
Well, I'll tell you what.

100
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,200
You all walk out of here,

101
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,800
and I won't redecorate this place with your face.

102
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,800
Son of a bitch.

103
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,300
Jennifer Mills.

104
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,200
She was here, yes?

105
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,000
Yes, yes, she was here.

106
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,800
Excellent start.

107
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,700
However...

108
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,600
progress requires suffering to evolve.

109
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,200
Go to hell.

110
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,900
No need for that, Mr. Clark.

111
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,600
In due time, hell will come to us.

112
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000

断头谷 第一季第4集</font>

114
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
<font color=#4096d1>-=破烂熊字幕组=-
时间轴：6</font>

115
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,500
No. Listen to me.

116
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,500
I already have a copy of the impound report.

117
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,200
I haven't spoken with the other officer,

118
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,000
or I would've directed my questions to them instead of you.

119
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Your sister bears an inglorious list of prior convictions.

120
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,600
Weapons charges.

121
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,800
- Breaking and entering. - She never did do anything halfway.

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,400
I want to know where she dumped the car,

123
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,300
were there any recent GTAs in the area, carjack reports,

124
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,300
and what direction she was going.

125
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,000
I'll hold.

126
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,700
It seems when she wasn't incarcerated,

127
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,200
she was traveling the world.

128
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,100
There are records of journeys to Mexico, Guatemala, Nepal...

129
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,500
someplace called Somalia.

130
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,500
It's a country in Africa.

131
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,400
Not exactly known for its law and order.

132
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,000
She would've fit right in.

133
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Why would someone travel to such exotic locales and then return

134
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
to Sleepy Hollow if all that awaited her here - was potential incarceration? - I don't know.

135
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,100
It's not like she had to come back for family reunions.

136
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,100
A personal query, if I may.

137
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,700
Where was your family during all this?

138
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,900
This is the perfect time to ask me about my childhood.

139
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,500
No, those dates were two weeks ago, I need today.

140
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,500
That is what I meant by "recently." Call me back.

141
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,000
Dad bailed when we were kids.

142
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,500
Mom had a nervous breakdown a few years later.

143
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,700
Hospitalized.

144
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,700
The state dumped us in foster care.

145
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,900
So, question answered.

146
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,700
After the age of 12, you had one foster home and Miss Jenny had seven.

147
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,200
I raise it merely to note she resided in her last home for nearly a full year.

148
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,900
Perhaps these charitable souls possess...

149
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,500
some information that might help us locate her.

150
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,000
Local Sheriff and protege honored by community

151
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,700
Definitely not a robbery. Till's still loaded.

152
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,600
There's a bank deposit bag full of cash and last night's receipts.

153
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,900
- Hmm. - Whatever it was, it was personal.

154
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,300
You might want to check your breakfast, boss.

155
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,500
What do you got up there?

156
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,000
My guess is somebody played a little hardball

157
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,600
and then made a pi帽ata out of him.

158
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,700
And a paperweight.

159
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,000
Just like Corbin and the Reverend.

160
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,300
No. The wounds aren't cauterized.

161
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,900
Corbin's and the Reverend's were.

162
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,700
Markings on the torso, face...

163
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,400
This man was tortured first.

164
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,200
Based on the blood pattern, head was taken after the fact, not as the killing blow.

165
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,800
Aside from the beheading, the M.O. is completely different.

166
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,800
I want to know the second Forensics has anything, on my cell phone only.

167
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,500
Let's stay off the radio on this one.

168
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,700
You expecting more of this?

169
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,200
In this town? What do you think?

170
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,300
Jenny was trouble. I remember that much.

171
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,600
Someone push her buttons, whoo-ee, she went off.

172
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,800
And I had to plead her case to the school superintendent or the sheriff.

173
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,600
You spoke to Sheriff Corbin about her? Ralphie, shut up!

174
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,100
Corbin's the one that caught her shoplifting.

175
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,900
He let her off, though. She claimed they'd never met.

176
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,900
To be honest, maybe a little hard jail time would've straightened her out.

177
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,300
Troubled kids, they need discipline and order.

178
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,500
That's what I give 'em.

179
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,300
The government pays you a monthly stipend for every child you take in, does it not?

180
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,000
Trust me, it ain't enough.

181
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
- Must be a hardship. - If you're implying that I'm taking advantage of the situation...

182
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,300
I'm not implying, I'm declaring.

183
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,300
That girl is sleeping on the floor in violation of your conservatorship contract

184
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,900
and about ten state laws.

185
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,200
Bags under her eyes, dry skin, all symptoms of malnutrition,

186
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,800
and yet somehow you have enough money to put a brand-new car in the driveway.

187
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,500
How is that?

188
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,600
I put a roof over your sister's head when no one else would.

189
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,700
Nobody wanted her.

190
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,400
Lieutenant.

191
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,900
You have one choice right now.

192
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,800
That is to tell me something, anything...

193
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,300
that will help me find her,

194
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,600
or so help me, I will rain legal brimstone down on you

195
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,600
so hard it will make God jealous.

196
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:28,500
She used to take off and go up to Trout Lake, about four miles north of here.

197
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,900
Said there was a cabin up there, - belonged to a friend. - What friend?

198
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,800
I got no idea.

199
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,600
Expect a call from Family Services.

200
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,700
Shutting you down. And get that girl some food.

201
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,400
She told me about you.

202
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,600
The "good" sister that just walked away.

203
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,100
Who you really mad at here, girly?

204
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,700
Me or you?

205
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,100
What are you doing?
Old habits die hard.

206
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,500
How fortuitous.

207
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,100
An officer of the law with a criminal past.

208
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,100
Imagine the delinquency we could perpetrate

209
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,000
if we really put our minds to it.

210
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,900
Lieutenant...

211
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,400
This home belonged to Sheriff Corbin.

212
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,000
Your sister?

213
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,100
Oh, my God.

214
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,300
I know. She lied to me.

215
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,700
It appears they were quite close.

216
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,500
You have no idea.

217
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,200
- Put it down. - You put it down.

218
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,100
- I'm not gonna ask you twice. - Neither am I.

219
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,600
Well... this is awkward.

220
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,100
- You gonna shoot me? - Why do you think

221
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,500
that we walk through the door instead of the SWAT team?

222
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,600
I bought you time. You need to trust me.

223
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,800
Trust is the last thing you're getting from me.

224
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,500
You have no idea what we're dealing with here.

225
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,900
- Jenny, I'm trying to make things right. - Give me a break!

226
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,100
It's so much easier for you to stick your head in the sand,

227
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,900
pretend what's right in front of you isn't really happening.

228
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,300
Maybe I ought to leave you here so you can bury your damn self!

229
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,400
Yeah, 'cause you're good at...

230
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,700
Enough!

231
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,000
If your familial ties meant so little to you,

232
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,800
you'd spend far less effort baiting her into a fight just to stoke your misguided pride.

233
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,600
And you...

234
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,400
Do make some effort not to be such an easy target.

235
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,400
Now drop your weapons, both of you.

236
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,900
Nice to see you again, British Guy.

237
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,800
My name is Ichabod Crane.

238
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,900
How long was Sheriff Corbin in your life?

239
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,700
What, he didn't tell you?

240
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,800
No, he did not.

241
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,200
The man had secrets.

242
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,900
I just never knew you were one of them.

243
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,100
Well, unlike certain people, he believed me.

244
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,500
I helped him obtain rare objects,

245
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,800
dig for information and find answers.

246
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,600
He sent you traveling? Why?

247
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,900
I knew you especially wouldn't understand.

248
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,000
Corbin sent me here. When?

249
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,600
He came to visit me the night before he died.

250
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,300
Never saw him in such a state.

251
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
He felt something was coming for him.

252
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,500
And when I asked him what, all he said was "Death."

253
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,100
My God.

254
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,400
He told me that if it turned out to be true,

255
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,500
I had to come here and get something, something that he needed me to keep safe.

256
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,100
A sextant. For mapping sea travel.

257
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,100
I never heard Corbin talk about it before.

258
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,300
Until the night before he died, right?

259
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,800
The man was scared. That's all I know.

260
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,700
Quite.

261
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
May I?

262
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,500
These markings, I've seen them.

263
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,700
Before the war in Boston.

264
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,200
We received word the Redcoats had acquired a device...

265
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,400
a weapon whose power could turn the tide of the war
- in favor of the British. - Wait. Wait a minute.

266
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,000
Is he kidding?

267
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,500
Five-second recap. Revolutionary soldier.

268
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,100
His wife put a spell on him and he wakes up two centuries later, now he's here.

269
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,300
How's that for believing?

270
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Which regiment?

271
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,300
The 37th. Commanding officer?

272
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,400
Colonel Jonathan Brewer, under the command of General George Washington.

273
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,400
If Washington knew the precise nature of the weapon we were sent to steal,

274
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,700
he certainly didn't tell us.

275
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:32,400
We tracked the secret weapon to a shipping warehouse at Boston Harbor.

276
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,500
As the British import tax on tea was at an all-time high,

277
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,600
I devised a diversion to gain entry.

278
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,200
The Boston Tea Party? You're not telling me this.

279
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:50,500
With the help of a local politician and ally in Boston, Mr. Samuel Adams.

280
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,300
You invented the Boston Tea Party so that you could steal something from the British?

281
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,400
At the time, it was referred to as "The destruction of the tea."

282
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,300
You've coined a far more festive name.

283
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:07,700
Unfortunately, my plans to acquire the weapon did not proceed smoothly.

284
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,800
Let's get what we came for.

285
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,700
The soldier guarding it was a Hessian.

286
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,000
- Like the Horseman. - As in "the" Horseman?

287
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,400
One story at a time.

288
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,600
The Hessian took his own life to protect the weapon.

289
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,200
No!

290
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,800
I alone was spared.

291
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,200
I saw what it was they sent us to claim.

292
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,400
A chest made of stone, therefore protected from the blast,

293
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,300
covered in markings identical to this.

294
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,900
I summoned a detachment to ferry the chest back to Washington in secret.

295
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,800
That was the last I ever saw of it.

296
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,600
- You never saw what was inside? - Whatever it was,

297
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,800
it warranted the deploying of Hessians to guard it.

298
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,600
German soldiers loyal to the British crown,

299
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,900
known for their ruthlessness in combat.

300
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,300
They sound fun. Why is the sextant connected to that chest?

301
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:12,900
Like many artifacts from my era, this sextant is much more than it appears.

302
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,900
A torch, a torch.

303
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,100
It's a projector...

304
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,300
hidden within the design of a sextant.

305
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,400
Washington, an avid cartographer himself,

306
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,700
had them crafted to hide weapons on the battlefield.

307
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,600
Looks like an old survey map.

308
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,000
Of Sleepy Hollow. But from my era.

309
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,300
I believe it pinpoints the whereabouts of our mystery chest.

310
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:52,900
Get down!

311
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,100
Don't move!

312
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,500
The sextant.

313
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,100
They've taken it.

314
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,500
Uzi pistol...

315
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,600
military specs.

316
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,100
That's a lot of gun for Sleepy Hollow.

317
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,700
What's in the chest?

318
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,500
Answer me.

319
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,800
Okay. Enough. My turn.

320
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,300
- What the hell are you doing? - This man tried to kill us.

321
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,200
- I am telling you to back down! - Oh. You want a feather?

322
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,400
- We can tickle it out of him? - Ladies.

323
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,100
THE MARK OF REINHESSEN.

324
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,900
SHADOW WARRIORS

325
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,900
5TH BATTALION.

326
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Like the Horseman before him,

327
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,200
he's a Hessian.

328
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,000
Still at it after two centuries.

329
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:56,700
It appears time hasn't diminished the Hessian's fascination with ancient artifacts.

330
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,100
??????

331
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,200
Your German is exceptional.

332
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,100
As is your tenacity.

333
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,700
What's in the box?

334
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,000
A doorway...

335
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,900
to the seventh circle of Hell,

336
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:19,400
where 72 condemned souls wait upon a shore of flaming sand.

337
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,600
A flair for the dramatic, I see.

338
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,300
The Book of Revelation is dramatic.

339
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,500
For the two witnesses of what has to come.

340
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,100
72 demons.

341
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,200
The Lesser Key of Solomon. That's what you're talking about, right?

342
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,400
Are we all having the same conversation here? It's a legend.

343
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,700
About a book of black magic written by King Solomon,

344
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:45,600
filled with rituals that can conjure 72 demons he trapped in Hell.

345
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,600
Are we to understand this book itself is a key?

346
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,800
Capable of unleashing these demons into our world?

347
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:57,600
It was found 12 centuries later by the Knights Templar during the Crusades.

348
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,100
Hidden away somewhere.

349
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:03,500
And thanks to your efforts, within our grasp at last.

350
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,900
That is never gonna happen.

351
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,200
You continue to misunderstand.

352
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:13,600
These hours are the final movements of a symphony written centuries ago.

353
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,700
And all the while, we've been hiding here in Sleepy Hollow.

354
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:22,800
Living ordinary, quiet lives as we pass your manicured lawns

355
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:27,100
smiling amicable smiles. One, two, three.

356
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,400
We're your neighbors.

357
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,500
Perhaps even your friends.

358
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,200
Yet underneath the skin,

359
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
unhindered by conscience, compassion,

360
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,900
remorse...

361
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,500
Security video placed the murder scene car at this address.

362
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,600
Prints at the scene are a match for the car and the premises.

363
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,700
The man's a music teacher.

364
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,400
What the hell is happening here?

365
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,300
Detectives.

366
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,700
How many of you are there?

367
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,700
Even I don't know.

368
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,100
And that's the whole point.

369
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,400
But I assure you, we are everywhere.

370
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,000
Growing stronger...

371
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
?????

372
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,200
preparing for the inevitable...

373
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,700
knowing our cause is just.

374
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,700
Sleeper cells always have someone at the top.

375
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,700
One person who controls the board,

376
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,300
who knows the endgame,

377
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,200
who moves all the chess pieces around.

378
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,900
You have already met him...

379
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,300
Miss Grace Abigail Mills.

380
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,500
You all have.

381
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,800
You, Miss Jennifer Mills... and Mr. Ichabod Crane.

382
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,400
How do you know my name?

383
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,400
- He told me. - Who?

384
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,500
He's inside of you.

385
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,400
In your hearts, in your minds.

386
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,600
He's been there since he appeared to you

387
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,600
that day in the forest.

388
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,100
He summoned the Horseman.

389
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:11,500
And with each dark spirit he brings into our world,

390
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,800
his grand design gets stronger.

391
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,700
He wants you to understand.

392
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,600
Tell me his name! My brothers have the map,

393
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,800
and soon the doorway will open,

394
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,300
and my task will be completed.

395
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,200
There's something in his mouth.

396
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,800
There's something in his mouth! Hold him, hold him!

397
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,700
Oh, no, no!

398
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,900
A cyanide pill.

399
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,800
What did he say?

400
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,000
It means, "Moloch shall rise."

401
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,900
No cell phone, no wallet, nothing to track him with.

402
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,500
This is Lieutenant Mills. I need Captain Irving immediately.

403
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,600
This is a priority request... Have you lost your mind?

404
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,800
You're talking on a cell phone after what he just told us?

405
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,600
This is a crime scene. That is a dead body.

406
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,000
His friends are already on their way. There are others out there just like him.

407
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,500
We have to assume they are everywhere. Trust no one.

408
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,100
Not the cops, not your boss. This is out of control, Jenny.

409
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,100
We can't do this by ourselves.

410
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:40,600
No, look. They were tracking me. Abbie.

411
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,200
You got to trust me on this, okay? We need to do this ourselves.

412
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,400
That is not the way - that we are doing this. - Oh, come on.

413
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,700
You cannot hide behind your badge this time, okay?

414
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,400
If it weren't for me, you would have half the National Guard - on your ass right now. - Maybe I do.

415
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,700
- You need to rethink... - Jenny...

416
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,400
I'm trying to concentrate!

417
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,000
Mill Pond.

418
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,200
Philipsburg Manor House.

419
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
You...

420
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,100
You remember it?

421
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,100
He has a photographic memory. Once I've seen an image,

422
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,100
recalling it is a rather simple matter.

423
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,900
- North was that way. - Mm-mm.

424
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,300
No, north is by the river.

425
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,500
Wait, I know where the river is. We used to swim there every Sunday.

426
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,600
I remember there was a church. The Dutch Reformed Church.

427
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,000
Southwest... here.

428
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,000
Uh... here.

429
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,300
The last known whereabouts of the Lesser Key of Solomon.

430
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,700
Let's go get this damn thing.

431
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,500
Here.

432
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:59,000
May I inquire where you received your combat training?

433
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
You're...

434
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,600
quite gifted.

435
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,200
Weapons and demo training in Mexico.

436
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,600
Sent a drug czar home in a box.

437
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,300
Insurgent tactics in South Sudan.

438
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,200
Warlords were stealing people's food.

439
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,300
And women.

440
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,900
So you're... a freedom fighter, then?

441
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,900
I kind of learned long ago that if you don't fight

442
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:26,700
for the things you stand for, you don't really stand for them.

443
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,400
Well, she does make a compelling...

444
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,200
Don't.

445
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,700
AS WRITTEN IN ARS GOETIA,

446
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
THE PORTAL SHALL BE OPENED...
THE KEY TURNED...

447
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,700
IN THE NAME OF MOLOCH...

448
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,700
SO IT BEGINS...

449
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,600
Back away!

450
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,500
Show me your hands!

451
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,700
Drop the book or your sister dies!

452
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,700
Don't do it, Abbie! Don't do it!

453
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,600
- Lieutenant! - Drop the book!

454
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,900
Now!

455
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,200
You got it.

456
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,800
No!

457
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,500
They left without a farewell.

458
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,400
How impolite.

459
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,500
I never got a chance to ask.

460
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,400
What's with you and Prince William?

461
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
You remember how Mom used to drag us to Bible study,

462
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,500
make us memorize passages?

463
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,600
Chapter and verse.

464
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,000
How much do you remember in Revelation?

465
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,500
"And I will give power "to my two witnesses,

466
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,500
and they will prophesy for 1,260 days."

467
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,100
Revelation, chapter 11.

468
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,000
You're telling me that's you and him.

469
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,100
I know it's...

470
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,600
it's impossible to believe, but...

471
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,900
I believe everything.

472
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,000
Here's one for you.

473
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,600
Psalm 94:1.

474
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,200
"O Lord, the God of vengeance,

475
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:53,200
let your glorious justice shine forth."

476
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,900
It's poetic, isn't it?

477
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,100
You turn your back on everything,

478
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,400
and now you're picked to fight the good fight.

479
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:08,200
Are you just gonna keep punishing me forever? I plan on it, yeah.

480
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,700
Maybe that's what this is.

481
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:17,100
It's my punishment for turning my back on you.

482
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,900
People say that, uh, things happen for a reason.

483
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,100
I haven't found one yet.

484
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,600
'Cause we lost everything in the forest that day.

485
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,600
Our childhood,

486
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,700
for a while, our sanity.

487
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,800
We lost each other, Jenny.

488
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,400
And I need you to know...

489
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,600
that...

490
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,900
I see who you really are.

491
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,700
And I'm proud of you.

492
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,200
We're all the family that we have left.

493
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,600
You and me.

494
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,900
That's it.

495
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,500
So...

496
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,600
I can't take back what I did.

497
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,000
But I can try to make it right.

498
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,200
What is this?

499
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:29,100
Paperwork granting me limited conservatorship over you and your legal affairs.

500
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,500
They'll appoint you an attorney.

501
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,800
We have to go to court, but if they say yes, I can get you...

502
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,000
out of there in less than six months.

503
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,200
It's a psychiatric hospital. I escaped.

504
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,800
What the hell are you gonna say that's gonna convince anyone of anything?

505
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,600
They can't afford to let the state know.

506
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,000
Otherwise, it'd mean that their security is incompetent,

507
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,700
they can't control their patients.

508
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,100
Long story short, you are a problem that they do not need.

509
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,000
And I believe that we can work together...

510
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:09,500
to get some answers, some real answers,

511
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,800
for once.

512
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,600
Corbin said...

513
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,900
that one day you'd be back.

514
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,400
When you were ready.

515
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:31,600
Asked me to find a way to forgive you.

516
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,700
I said I didn't think I could.

517
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,700
I'm sorry that it took me so long to find you.

518
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,100
Miss Mills.

519
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:11,300
The Hessian's final words were, "Moloch shall rise."

520
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:14,300
The name is referenced in several theological texts,

521
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,800
notably Milton's Paradise Lost.

522
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,100
"First Moloch, horrid King besmear'd with blood...

523
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,100
of human sacrifice, and parents tears."

524
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,400
So called as the God-Demon of child sacrifice

525
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,600
who led a revolt of fellow demons against Heaven.

526
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,800
This is the creature you saw in the forest, Miss Mills.

527
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,900
The one who controls the Horseman,

528
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,300
who guards Katrina.

529
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,500
And now we know his name.

530
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:56,500
