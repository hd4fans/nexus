1
00:02:07,296 --> 00:02:09,173
Bobby.

2
00:02:09,423 --> 00:02:11,216
Bobby.

3
00:02:11,467 --> 00:02:14,219
No!

4
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:40,132
All right, we lined up?

5
00:03:40,382 --> 00:03:43,593
Get that line.

6
00:03:49,724 --> 00:03:54,020
Put the stern line on quick.

7
00:04:14,581 --> 00:04:17,543
Bobby!

8
00:04:20,378 --> 00:04:23,422
Hey, baby!

9
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:33,390
Missed you.

10
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:41,064
Hey, big man, how you doing?

11
00:04:46,611 --> 00:04:49,030
-Hey, Murph!
-Hey, Ethel.

12
00:04:49,281 --> 00:04:51,031
How you doing? Welcome home.

13
00:04:51,282 --> 00:04:53,450
-You seen Deb and my boy?
-No, I'm sorry.

14
00:04:53,701 --> 00:04:56,287
Ma!

15
00:04:56,996 --> 00:05:00,916
-How you doing, beautiful?
-Hello, Bobby.

16
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:04,627
Home safe.

17
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,260
Who's that?

18
00:05:13,303 --> 00:05:16,014
-OI' Ben.
-No.

19
00:05:16,264 --> 00:05:18,807
Poor old guy.

20
00:05:19,057 --> 00:05:20,893
Hey, Linda.

21
00:05:21,144 --> 00:05:24,772
-Hey, boss.
-What's the score?

22
00:05:26,483 --> 00:05:27,608
My kind of numbers.

23
00:05:27,858 --> 00:05:31,819
I lost Ben Pulley.
He passed away onboard.

24
00:05:32,696 --> 00:05:34,405
Sorry to hear that.

25
00:05:34,656 --> 00:05:37,742
How'd you hit it, Billy?

26
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,620
Didn't hit very hard, did you?

27
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,789
We all have slumps, but you're overdue
to break out of yours.

28
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,417
Did you hear the lady?
Ben Pulley's dead.

29
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:51,046
That old man pickled himself to death
drinking 7&7s chasing Narragansetts.

30
00:05:51,296 --> 00:05:55,925
Linda, with Ben, it was never
a question of "if", but "when."

31
00:05:56,176 --> 00:05:58,261
-I'll bury him.
-I'll pay for it.

32
00:05:58,512 --> 00:06:00,304
See, you got what you wanted.

33
00:06:00,555 --> 00:06:05,267
Bring in your fish.
It shouldn't take too long.

34
00:07:27,594 --> 00:07:30,847
8-5.

35
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,479
4-7-5.

36
00:07:58,414 --> 00:08:01,000
Murph.

37
00:08:01,543 --> 00:08:04,587
Sign my ledger.

38
00:08:04,962 --> 00:08:07,715
Shatford.

39
00:08:08,174 --> 00:08:11,301
Sign my ledger.

40
00:08:14,138 --> 00:08:15,138
What's the matter?

41
00:08:15,388 --> 00:08:18,808
It's $2221.
Aren't we a little short?

42
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:24,647
We were sharing up last night.
I thought it'd be three plus.

43
00:08:25,982 --> 00:08:30,735
You stocked 21,000 pounds at 3.50
a pound. That comes to $73,000.

44
00:08:30,986 --> 00:08:35,698
Minus $35,000 for bait, tackle, fuel.
That comes out to $38,500.

45
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,408
I get half. I own the boat.

46
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:40,411
Your captain takes double share,
four crewmen get a share each.

47
00:08:40,663 --> 00:08:43,289
And a rookie like you,
three-quarters share.

48
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:47,001
That comes to $2221 .

49
00:08:47,252 --> 00:08:48,836
What it is, is what it is.

50
00:08:49,087 --> 00:08:52,090
Sign the ledger.

51
00:08:57,219 --> 00:08:59,930
Moran.

52
00:09:02,683 --> 00:09:04,935
You going out again this season,
skipper?

53
00:09:05,185 --> 00:09:07,520
Why?

54
00:09:07,771 --> 00:09:10,732
You got a site in Florida?

55
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:14,026
Bradenton Beach.

56
00:09:14,277 --> 00:09:16,821
The "Cecile."

57
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:20,532
Pack your shit and get out.

58
00:09:20,658 --> 00:09:22,994
You like Florida?

59
00:09:23,244 --> 00:09:26,204
Well, it beats the Grand Banks
in October.

60
00:09:26,455 --> 00:09:30,417
It gets rough up here,
Dougie likes the sun down there.

61
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:33,002
Or he thinks he'll score better
with another captain.

62
00:09:33,253 --> 00:09:34,670
I didn't say that.

63
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,882
Yes, you did.

64
00:09:38,091 --> 00:09:40,050
Goodbye.

65
00:09:40,301 --> 00:09:46,055
Here's your cut. $5923.76.
Sign the ledger.

66
00:09:46,307 --> 00:09:48,642
That's a record low for you,
isn't it?

67
00:09:48,893 --> 00:09:52,896
Next time, track Linda.
She'll take you where the fish are.

68
00:09:53,146 --> 00:09:55,356
You're getting to be rude, you know?

69
00:09:55,608 --> 00:09:58,067
I like you, Billy.
I always have.

70
00:09:58,318 --> 00:09:59,735
But I like my boat better.

71
00:09:59,986 --> 00:10:03,323
If you can't make it pay,
I'll find somebody who can.

72
00:10:03,573 --> 00:10:06,158
You trying to put a charge up my ass?

73
00:10:06,408 --> 00:10:08,160
You're on a cold streak.

74
00:10:08,411 --> 00:10:10,245
I'm encouraging you
to catch fish.

75
00:10:10,496 --> 00:10:12,872
I'll bring you more fish
than you ever dreamed of.

76
00:10:13,123 --> 00:10:15,834
Next time I fish the Grand Banks,
they won't be so grand.

77
00:10:16,085 --> 00:10:17,960
You just struck out
on the Grand Banks.

78
00:10:18,212 --> 00:10:20,881
Then I'll go further.

79
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:24,175
Don't even think about it.
I want my boat back.

80
00:10:24,425 --> 00:10:26,259
And I want to catch some fish.

81
00:10:26,511 --> 00:10:27,929
It's what I do.

82
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:29,179
Not lately.

83
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,309
Want to yank my site, you go ahead.

84
00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:55,496
-Murph.
-Hey, skip.

85
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:59,333
What are you doing out here?
Get in there. Get drunk.

86
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,626
Waiting on my ex...

87
00:11:01,877 --> 00:11:04,712
...and my son.

88
00:11:07,675 --> 00:11:10,969
Give him lots of
hugs and kisses tonight.

89
00:11:11,219 --> 00:11:15,515
You don't gotta remind me
to do that, skip.

90
00:11:17,766 --> 00:11:19,977
Ladies, you're looking fine.
How you doing?

91
00:11:20,228 --> 00:11:24,315
Can I buy you a drink?
What, what, what?

92
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,614
Hey, rookie.

93
00:11:33,157 --> 00:11:35,616
What are you so happy about?

94
00:11:35,867 --> 00:11:38,953
It wasn't exactly a slammer
up on the Grand Banks.

95
00:11:39,203 --> 00:11:42,414
Isn't it past your bedtime?

96
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:44,459
Bugs, how you making out?

97
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:47,586
I'm not.

98
00:11:48,253 --> 00:11:50,672
I don't know.
Maybe I smell like fish.

99
00:11:50,923 --> 00:11:55,760
-You need a new deodorant.
-Maybe I need a new face.

100
00:11:57,345 --> 00:12:00,556
Frickin' Alfred Pierre.

101
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:04,728
They were upstairs, they come down,
a little refreshment.

102
00:12:04,978 --> 00:12:06,812
Now they're going back up again.

103
00:12:07,062 --> 00:12:09,690
Half an hour ago, they shook
the lamps over the bar.

104
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:15,277
Last time she brought her sister.
You should've seen the lamps then.

105
00:12:15,654 --> 00:12:17,447
How do he do it, mon?

106
00:12:17,698 --> 00:12:22,078
I think he's fishin'
with a longer pole, Bugs.

107
00:12:31,628 --> 00:12:32,669
What happened?

108
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,965
They had a sale on kids' shoes
at Ames.

109
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:39,550
Sorry.

110
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:41,887
No problem.

111
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,387
Hi.

112
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:46,432
Hello.

113
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:51,104
So you want to have a drink?

114
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,355
Come on, Debra.

115
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,525
What do you say, for old times' sake?

116
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:59,486
It was the old times that killed us.

117
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,490
Is that what it was?

118
00:13:05,575 --> 00:13:07,327
There you go.

119
00:13:07,577 --> 00:13:10,830
I'm a little short.
It wasn't exactly a slammer.

120
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,625
Half for you.

121
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:15,126
You sure?

122
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:18,003
Yeah, I'm working.

123
00:13:22,258 --> 00:13:25,176
Want to come with your daddy?

124
00:13:25,635 --> 00:13:28,555
Shoot some pool?

125
00:13:29,432 --> 00:13:32,476
Have a drink?

126
00:13:36,771 --> 00:13:40,400
Just bring him home in an hour.

127
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,126
Good shot, buddy.

128
00:14:00,377 --> 00:14:02,962
All right, Sully, you think about it.

129
00:14:03,212 --> 00:14:05,882
All right?

130
00:14:07,675 --> 00:14:10,803
Bugs.

131
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:12,679
Murph, come here.

132
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:15,724
Here comes your fearless leader,
Captain Billy Tyne.

133
00:14:15,974 --> 00:14:20,395
I got a feeling skipper's
coming to give us bad news.

134
00:14:20,395 --> 00:14:24,357
Lady's not only pretty, she's smart.

135
00:14:24,816 --> 00:14:27,026
Yeah, we're going back out.

136
00:14:27,276 --> 00:14:30,196
What'd I tell you?

137
00:14:30,405 --> 00:14:32,364
-When?
-A few days.

138
00:14:32,615 --> 00:14:34,115
"Few" means two?

139
00:14:34,366 --> 00:14:35,408
Two days is right.

140
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:37,244
Skip, we just got back in.

141
00:14:37,495 --> 00:14:41,664
You don't want your site,
a replacement's a call away.

142
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,752
Join me, don't join me.

143
00:14:46,002 --> 00:14:48,629
There's time for one last shot.
The "Andrea Gail" will take it.

144
00:14:48,881 --> 00:14:52,634
This time I promise you, we'll
come back with a shitload of fish.

145
00:14:52,884 --> 00:14:56,137
Excuse me, men, madam.

146
00:15:00,557 --> 00:15:02,101
What are you gonna do?

147
00:15:02,352 --> 00:15:05,354
I'm gonna tell him to
stick his head up his ass.

148
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:07,688
I'd like to hear that.

149
00:15:07,939 --> 00:15:08,898
Hear what?

150
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:11,651
I'd like to hear you tell him
to stick it up his ass.

151
00:15:11,901 --> 00:15:14,737
Go on, Bob.

152
00:15:17,907 --> 00:15:21,619
Yeah, that's just how I'll tell him
as soon as we get back.

153
00:15:21,869 --> 00:15:23,787
You're a bastard.

154
00:15:24,038 --> 00:15:26,248
Why? Why do I even love you?

155
00:15:26,498 --> 00:15:28,542
-Come on.
-No. Why? Why, Bobby?

156
00:15:28,793 --> 00:15:31,920
When you get the answer, tell me.
I could use it myself.

157
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:36,466
-Get laid, Bugsy.
-Easy for you to say.

158
00:15:44,181 --> 00:15:45,473
Go on up there.

159
00:15:45,725 --> 00:15:49,061
Don't make the same mistake I did.

160
00:15:57,652 --> 00:16:01,197
You're going away again?

161
00:16:02,031 --> 00:16:03,657
Yeah.

162
00:16:03,908 --> 00:16:07,495
Take me with you.

163
00:16:09,913 --> 00:16:12,750
Come here.

164
00:16:14,626 --> 00:16:16,419
Go back, Bobby.

165
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:19,089
Go back to what you did before.

166
00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:22,633
-Pack cod, repair tackle.
-I'm sick of that.

167
00:16:22,884 --> 00:16:25,011
It's safe and it pays.

168
00:16:25,262 --> 00:16:27,013
Not enough.

169
00:16:27,263 --> 00:16:29,347
Just one more time. I promise.

170
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:32,268
I have to try it again.
We need the money, baby.

171
00:16:32,518 --> 00:16:35,687
Money. It's always about the money.

172
00:16:35,937 --> 00:16:41,650
Well, I got a divorce lawyer,
a mountain of debt.

173
00:16:41,651 --> 00:16:46,614
And there's your two kids.
You gotta get them back.

174
00:16:47,365 --> 00:16:49,283
Do you think you'll love them?

175
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:52,828
They're yours, aren't they?

176
00:17:11,179 --> 00:17:12,721
Hey, beautiful.

177
00:17:12,972 --> 00:17:14,973
Yeah, you.

178
00:17:15,225 --> 00:17:17,727
Buy you a drink?

179
00:17:17,977 --> 00:17:21,271
Seeing as I got two in front of me,
I don't think so.

180
00:17:21,522 --> 00:17:24,566
I'm not very observant, am I?

181
00:17:24,817 --> 00:17:28,069
I got a feeling, yeah,
along with a lot of other things.

182
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,073
Why don't we start over?

183
00:17:31,323 --> 00:17:35,993
You know what would look good on you?
Me.

184
00:17:37,538 --> 00:17:40,373
No good?

185
00:17:42,834 --> 00:17:46,712
Have a drink. It's not that bad.

186
00:17:47,754 --> 00:17:51,299
Thank you. Here's to crime.

187
00:17:56,221 --> 00:17:59,432
You're pathetic.

188
00:18:01,184 --> 00:18:02,893
You still want to be a fisherman?

189
00:18:03,145 --> 00:18:05,855
Who told you I wanted to be
a fisherman?

190
00:18:06,105 --> 00:18:07,440
You want to come with me.

191
00:18:07,691 --> 00:18:12,652
I want to come with you,
but I don't want to be a fisherman.

192
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:19,159
You know, buddy...

193
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:23,455
...one of these days your mom's
gonna find you a new dad.

194
00:18:23,705 --> 00:18:25,873
I don't want a new dad.

195
00:18:26,124 --> 00:18:27,250
I'm sorry.

196
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,627
Your mom can't sit around
by herself all the time.

197
00:18:30,878 --> 00:18:34,339
She isn't sitting around.

198
00:18:50,063 --> 00:18:52,940
I'm sure he's a good guy.

199
00:18:53,191 --> 00:18:58,152
I know your mom wouldn't take up
with anybody but a good guy.

200
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,491
And you know, buddy...

201
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:07,079
...the most important thing is
that you and Mommy are happy.

202
00:19:07,329 --> 00:19:11,957
Can we talk about something else now?

203
00:19:21,926 --> 00:19:25,638
I miss you too, buddy.

204
00:19:30,267 --> 00:19:34,229
I miss you so damn much.

205
00:19:34,396 --> 00:19:37,482
What'd you say your name was again?

206
00:19:37,732 --> 00:19:39,733
Irene. Is that so tough?

207
00:19:39,984 --> 00:19:42,903
I'm sorry. Listen.

208
00:19:43,154 --> 00:19:45,948
Could I maybe take you home?

209
00:19:46,198 --> 00:19:48,074
I don't think so.

210
00:19:48,325 --> 00:19:54,080
I came to watch the game. Instead I
got schnockered with Bugsy.

211
00:19:54,248 --> 00:19:57,418
-What does Bugsy stand for anyway?
-Michael.

212
00:19:57,668 --> 00:20:00,211
That's a nice name.
Why don't you use it?

213
00:20:00,461 --> 00:20:03,673
Because people know me as Bugsy.

214
00:20:04,674 --> 00:20:07,134
I'm gonna shove off now.
Big day tomorrow.

215
00:20:07,385 --> 00:20:09,929
I can't take you home?

216
00:20:10,179 --> 00:20:11,763
What, in a wheelbarrow?

217
00:20:12,014 --> 00:20:13,890
Crew guys like you never have cars.

218
00:20:14,141 --> 00:20:16,727
Lay off. I got feelings too.

219
00:20:16,978 --> 00:20:20,939
Where, down in your pants?

220
00:20:21,189 --> 00:20:24,317
Jesus, lady, where's the passion
in your life?

221
00:20:24,568 --> 00:20:26,652
Home in bed.

222
00:20:26,902 --> 00:20:30,823
One of them's 6, the other one's 8.

223
00:20:30,906 --> 00:20:34,618
All I can say is,
there's some lucky kids.

224
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:37,830
They got a wonderful mother.

225
00:20:42,043 --> 00:20:45,628
You're not messing with me, are you?

226
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:50,091
Haven't got time.
We're going out in two days.

227
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:54,095
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, Michael.

228
00:20:54,095 --> 00:20:57,014
Gotta go.

229
00:20:57,222 --> 00:21:00,100
What do you mean?

230
00:21:00,769 --> 00:21:02,394
-Where you going?
-Have these.

231
00:21:02,644 --> 00:21:05,813
-Thank you.
-See you.

232
00:21:08,192 --> 00:21:11,861
-Bye, Ethel.
-See you.

233
00:21:28,418 --> 00:21:31,003
Watch your step.

234
00:21:39,513 --> 00:21:41,305
I smell Coppertone.

235
00:21:41,555 --> 00:21:43,473
That means that
Captain Linda Greenlaw...

236
00:21:43,724 --> 00:21:46,977
...a lady vain about her nose,
is in my wheelhouse.

237
00:21:47,228 --> 00:21:48,520
Make that Hawaiian Tropic.

238
00:21:48,771 --> 00:21:51,732
At least I got the nose right.

239
00:21:51,982 --> 00:21:55,527
Your guys are loading bait
and groceries.

240
00:21:55,777 --> 00:21:58,697
-You doing a turnaround?
-No rest for the weary.

241
00:21:58,948 --> 00:22:01,282
There you go.
Flaunting your work ethic.

242
00:22:01,533 --> 00:22:03,702
I don't have a work ethic.
I just have work.

243
00:22:03,952 --> 00:22:06,620
If I'm gonna catch up to you.

244
00:22:06,871 --> 00:22:08,580
I love to watch you study charts.

245
00:22:08,831 --> 00:22:10,332
Why?

246
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:12,876
You know them all by heart.

247
00:22:13,127 --> 00:22:15,920
What's special about today
that you're blowing smoke up my ass?

248
00:22:16,171 --> 00:22:19,049
I thought I'd make a pass.

249
00:22:21,426 --> 00:22:25,012
You see, I'm looking for a guy
to come home to Maine with me...

250
00:22:25,264 --> 00:22:26,723
...buy a house and raise kids.

251
00:22:26,973 --> 00:22:30,143
What does that guy and you do after?

252
00:22:30,393 --> 00:22:33,603
The thing is, I'm happy.
I'm happy I'm fit to do this.

253
00:22:33,855 --> 00:22:35,982
I just don't see the romance in it.

254
00:22:36,232 --> 00:22:39,317
But you've got it, Captain Greenlaw.

255
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:41,235
You do. Believe me.

256
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:43,238
I've seen them come and go.

257
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:47,366
The day I laid eyes on you, I said,
"She's gonna be a good one."

258
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:50,996
You can't be good unless you love it.

259
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:54,958
The fog's just lifting.

260
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:59,253
You throw off your bow line,
throw off your stern.

261
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,172
You head out the South Channel...

262
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:05,300
...past Rocky Neck,
Ten Pound Island...

263
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:09,304
...past Niles Pond,
where I skated as a kid.

264
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:10,680
Blow your horn...

265
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:14,684
...and wave to the lighthouse
keeper's kid on Thatcher Island.

266
00:23:14,934 --> 00:23:16,435
Then the birds show up.

267
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,270
Black-backs...

268
00:23:18,521 --> 00:23:22,983
...herring gulls, big dump ducks.

269
00:23:23,275 --> 00:23:24,692
The sun hits you.

270
00:23:24,943 --> 00:23:28,489
Head north, open up to 12.

271
00:23:28,739 --> 00:23:30,448
You're steaming now.

272
00:23:30,699 --> 00:23:34,661
The guys are busy,
you're in charge.

273
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:39,749
You know what?
You're a goddamn swordboat captain.

274
00:23:41,334 --> 00:23:45,087
Is there anything better in the world?

275
00:23:56,932 --> 00:23:59,559
Sully.

276
00:24:01,228 --> 00:24:04,605
So what do you think?

277
00:24:07,401 --> 00:24:08,484
You been busy?

278
00:24:08,734 --> 00:24:10,110
Busy enough.

279
00:24:10,361 --> 00:24:13,155
I was working menhaden in Annisquam.

280
00:24:13,406 --> 00:24:15,740
But they laid off Labor Day.

281
00:24:15,991 --> 00:24:17,575
Mended nets over in Fairhaven.

282
00:24:17,827 --> 00:24:21,788
That's crap.
What's this you're doing now?

283
00:24:22,038 --> 00:24:23,372
Helping out a friend.

284
00:24:23,623 --> 00:24:25,375
He paying you?

285
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:28,752
He's my friend.

286
00:24:31,631 --> 00:24:34,717
Murphy keep his site?

287
00:24:36,969 --> 00:24:40,222
You want this job or not?

288
00:24:40,556 --> 00:24:43,349
I do.

289
00:25:47,452 --> 00:25:51,913
Lord, did I do that?

290
00:25:52,915 --> 00:25:55,167
Yeah, you did.

291
00:25:55,417 --> 00:26:00,254
But I'm not completely blind.
I can still see out of the other one.

292
00:26:00,506 --> 00:26:01,714
Next time I should break a leg.

293
00:26:01,965 --> 00:26:04,801
Then you can stay home
and collect disability.

294
00:26:05,051 --> 00:26:09,430
Think of all those
handicapped parking spaces.

295
00:26:11,224 --> 00:26:13,893
Tell me last night was worth it.

296
00:26:14,143 --> 00:26:16,269
I can't remember.

297
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,105
Can't remember, my ass.

298
00:26:19,357 --> 00:26:23,235
No, I remember your ass.

299
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,530
Last night was worth it.

300
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,865
There's nothing like
sleeping with you.

301
00:26:30,116 --> 00:26:31,658
Just sleeping...

302
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:34,370
...lying next to you...

303
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,955
...all warm and sweet.

304
00:26:37,206 --> 00:26:41,377
And me wishing the morning
would never come.

305
00:26:49,843 --> 00:26:52,929
Catching up.

306
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:59,727
Oh, boy, oh, boy.
Look at that shiner.

307
00:26:59,978 --> 00:27:02,938
Come on, Murph, will you?

308
00:27:02,938 --> 00:27:05,024
Good morning.
Where'd you get the mouse?

309
00:27:05,274 --> 00:27:08,693
Chris "Boom-Boom" Cotter.

310
00:27:09,819 --> 00:27:13,531
Put some hair around that hole,
I bet you could hit it.

311
00:27:13,781 --> 00:27:19,077
Not with a pool cue,
or any other pointed instrument.

312
00:27:19,954 --> 00:27:25,375
What do you know except to cut squid
and take them to bed with you?

313
00:27:26,127 --> 00:27:28,754
Ethel, where you getting
your customers these days?

314
00:27:29,004 --> 00:27:31,089
The welfare office?

315
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,216
Who gave you that scar, tough guy?

316
00:27:34,468 --> 00:27:36,261
Back off! Back off.

317
00:27:36,511 --> 00:27:37,762
Come on, swing it.

318
00:27:38,013 --> 00:27:40,973
You assholes!

319
00:27:41,766 --> 00:27:45,936
How you gonna act onboard if you're
already at each other's throats?

320
00:27:46,187 --> 00:27:48,772
All right, Ma.

321
00:27:49,398 --> 00:27:52,567
See you onboard.

322
00:27:55,821 --> 00:27:59,157
-Alfred Pierre, one for the road?
-No, tanks, Mom.

323
00:27:59,407 --> 00:28:02,619
"No, tanks, Mom."
Guy can't even speak good English.

324
00:28:02,869 --> 00:28:04,953
Well, anyway, can I get you anything?

325
00:28:05,205 --> 00:28:08,083
Let's go, boys.

326
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:12,294
I'll wait for you in the car, Bobby.

327
00:28:12,503 --> 00:28:15,547
Catch fish, boys. Lots of them.
Full ahead.

328
00:28:15,798 --> 00:28:17,882
Hold down the fort, Quentin.

329
00:28:18,133 --> 00:28:19,759
Thanks, Q.

330
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:22,680
Thanks, Ethel.

331
00:28:25,098 --> 00:28:28,101
Gotta go, Mom.

332
00:28:29,102 --> 00:28:31,228
The Grand Banks.

333
00:28:31,479 --> 00:28:32,729
I know.

334
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:37,776
Grand Banks are no joke in October.
All right?

335
00:28:39,569 --> 00:28:42,447
Be careful.

336
00:29:19,816 --> 00:29:23,527
At least we'll get cancer together.

337
00:29:27,489 --> 00:29:30,325
I can't put it off any longer.

338
00:29:30,576 --> 00:29:34,163
I'm not too big on goodbyes.

339
00:29:35,331 --> 00:29:40,543
Don't go, Bobby. I got a bad feeling.

340
00:29:40,543 --> 00:29:42,544
I've been thinking about it.

341
00:29:42,795 --> 00:29:45,131
Then for God's sake, don't go.

342
00:29:45,381 --> 00:29:47,257
I'll moonlight, I'll sell the car.

343
00:29:47,508 --> 00:29:49,509
We'll work nights, weekends.

344
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,805
Whatever it takes, little by little,
we'll put something away.

345
00:29:59,561 --> 00:30:02,563
I gotta go.

346
00:30:10,113 --> 00:30:12,907
Michael.

347
00:30:28,546 --> 00:30:29,339
Irene.

348
00:30:29,589 --> 00:30:33,008
Irene. I knew that.

349
00:30:35,512 --> 00:30:39,014
I just wanted to say goodbye.

350
00:30:39,014 --> 00:30:42,851
No one ever said goodbye to me before.

351
00:30:48,065 --> 00:30:49,565
Well, goodbye, Irene.

352
00:30:49,817 --> 00:30:50,650
Goodbye.

353
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:55,029
I wish it were night so I could say,
"Good night, Irene."

354
00:30:56,739 --> 00:30:59,616
That'll come later.

355
00:31:02,537 --> 00:31:04,329
Well, you gotta go.

356
00:31:04,579 --> 00:31:08,083
Come on, boys. Let's go.

357
00:31:19,427 --> 00:31:21,470
I love you.

358
00:31:21,721 --> 00:31:25,348
I will always love you, Christina.

359
00:33:03,691 --> 00:33:07,026
Pack it in there good.
We got more coming down.

360
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:10,823
Did we get all them eggs up there?

361
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,918
We catching some fish

362
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,836
Is that gonna crap out again?

363
00:33:26,086 --> 00:33:28,880
Never!

364
00:34:04,956 --> 00:34:07,792
Do you mind?

365
00:34:10,045 --> 00:34:12,839
Stinks in here, doesn't it?

366
00:34:13,089 --> 00:34:16,300
Not anymore.

367
00:34:26,685 --> 00:34:30,146
Hi, Bobby:
You're somewhere out there...

368
00:34:30,396 --> 00:34:33,691
...on the deep blue, goddamn sea...

369
00:34:33,941 --> 00:34:37,653
...and I'm writing this on a box
of two semi-down pillows...

370
00:34:37,903 --> 00:34:41,281
...that I secretly bought for us
at Penney's.

371
00:34:41,531 --> 00:34:43,741
And I'm smiling to myself because...

372
00:34:43,992 --> 00:34:46,870
...of the surprise I have
in store for you.

373
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:52,333
I'm talking removal from our dungeon
in the Crow's Nest...

374
00:34:52,584 --> 00:34:56,295
...to our own place.

375
00:34:56,462 --> 00:34:58,631
It's no great shakes...

376
00:34:58,881 --> 00:35:03,467
...but you gotta begin
with a baby shake, right?

377
00:35:04,428 --> 00:35:06,596
Forever love, Bobby.

378
00:35:06,847 --> 00:35:10,726
I'm in this for the long run.

379
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:17,315
-I'm not intruding, am I?
-You're not intruding.

380
00:35:17,565 --> 00:35:19,358
You're a natural.

381
00:35:19,609 --> 00:35:21,485
You've got some old salt
in your blood.

382
00:35:21,735 --> 00:35:24,405
Thanks.

383
00:35:25,406 --> 00:35:27,991
You're a happy man out here,
aren't you?

384
00:35:28,242 --> 00:35:30,160
Today, maybe.

385
00:35:30,411 --> 00:35:31,995
When do you get unhappy?

386
00:35:32,246 --> 00:35:33,955
The day we go home.

387
00:35:34,206 --> 00:35:38,127
Home? I thought the sea
was your home.

388
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:42,046
You got me there.

389
00:35:42,923 --> 00:35:46,676
But if you were gonna pin me down...

390
00:35:46,926 --> 00:35:50,138
...I guess Pensacola, Florida is home.

391
00:35:50,388 --> 00:35:52,180
My ex lives there. Jodi.

392
00:35:52,431 --> 00:35:55,559
And my kids.

393
00:35:56,269 --> 00:36:00,272
I wasn't very good at doing things
the way they're supposed to be done.

394
00:36:00,522 --> 00:36:02,482
Wife.

395
00:36:02,733 --> 00:36:04,150
Kids.

396
00:36:04,401 --> 00:36:06,777
A house with things in it.
All that stuff.

397
00:36:07,028 --> 00:36:09,363
So why are you so happy?

398
00:36:09,614 --> 00:36:12,033
You just got me on a good day.

399
00:36:12,283 --> 00:36:14,994
I'm doing what I was made to do.

400
00:36:15,244 --> 00:36:19,456
And I got a feeling I'll do it
even better this time.

401
00:36:19,914 --> 00:36:22,584
How about you?

402
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,754
I got a woman I can't stand to be
more than two feet away from.

403
00:36:26,004 --> 00:36:28,882
Congratulations.

404
00:36:29,132 --> 00:36:33,927
Then again, I love to fish.

405
00:36:37,222 --> 00:36:39,307
Son, you've got a problem.

406
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:42,394
I know.

407
00:36:56,699 --> 00:36:59,410
Here you are.

408
00:37:06,376 --> 00:37:10,128
What do you think? Blue skies,
scattered showers, same old, same old?

409
00:37:10,379 --> 00:37:12,339
-Your guess is as good as mine.
-Or better.

410
00:37:12,589 --> 00:37:15,466
Watch it.

411
00:37:17,093 --> 00:37:20,471
This doesn't look good.

412
00:37:25,226 --> 00:37:27,852
Looks pretty ugly here too.

413
00:37:28,104 --> 00:37:30,397
Pam.

414
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:35,651
Tell Bernie I need two graphics:
Bermuda and Sable Island.

415
00:37:53,294 --> 00:37:55,628
Good.

416
00:37:55,879 --> 00:37:57,214
What's our course?

417
00:37:57,464 --> 00:38:01,467
I've been sailing 42 years.
Never plotted a course.

418
00:38:01,718 --> 00:38:03,845
I set the compass, I ride it...

419
00:38:04,096 --> 00:38:07,932
...we'll be in Bermuda in no time.

420
00:38:49,721 --> 00:38:52,389
Let's go fishing.

421
00:38:52,724 --> 00:38:55,769
All right, guys, let's hit it!

422
00:38:56,019 --> 00:39:01,940
1000 hooks in the water before dinner.
I want 40 miles out there.

423
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,906
Three-mile buoy out!

424
00:39:10,157 --> 00:39:13,118
Yeah, baby.

425
00:39:20,416 --> 00:39:23,126
Set.

426
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:40,477
Okay, Sully, put it out.

427
00:39:40,727 --> 00:39:44,021
Highflyer!

428
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,423
Hey, A.P.

429
00:40:12,924 --> 00:40:14,174
May the force be with us.

430
00:40:14,425 --> 00:40:16,885
You want to play with lightsticks,
stick them up your ass.

431
00:40:17,137 --> 00:40:17,928
Easy, Murph.

432
00:40:18,178 --> 00:40:20,972
He's dead weight.
He's been screwing around all night.

433
00:40:21,223 --> 00:40:22,598
A juicer and a head.

434
00:40:22,849 --> 00:40:24,058
Cape Ann, bottom shelf.

435
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:28,563
Yeah, well, your wife
didn't feel that way.

436
00:40:32,442 --> 00:40:34,234
Hey, knock it off!

437
00:40:34,485 --> 00:40:37,905
I'll head for land and the Newfies
will throw you both in jail!

438
00:40:38,156 --> 00:40:40,240
All right, cap.

439
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:43,160
Give us some lights.

440
00:40:44,245 --> 00:40:45,579
Come on. Jesus.

441
00:40:45,829 --> 00:40:47,788
Shake, you guys.

442
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,792
Shake!

443
00:41:00,343 --> 00:41:02,720
-Just let it go.
-Your day is coming.

444
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:05,764
Whenever you're ready.
I'll be right up here.

445
00:41:06,015 --> 00:41:10,353
The job ain't hard enough
without this knucklehead.

446
00:41:36,335 --> 00:41:39,045
Let's go.

447
00:41:43,216 --> 00:41:46,511
We're gonna make some money.

448
00:41:46,761 --> 00:41:49,972
Let's go, boys!

449
00:41:50,556 --> 00:41:53,685
Let's go! Come on!

450
00:42:10,616 --> 00:42:13,327
Come on.

451
00:42:32,762 --> 00:42:35,055
Do it, skip, do it.

452
00:42:35,306 --> 00:42:38,100
Make a killing.

453
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:39,602
One's on.

454
00:42:39,852 --> 00:42:42,437
Fish on.

455
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:46,733
Have those gaffs ready.

456
00:42:46,984 --> 00:42:50,946
Don't lose him, Murph.
Don't lose him.

457
00:42:51,447 --> 00:42:54,532
Pull him in, Murph.

458
00:42:59,412 --> 00:43:03,374
All right, now, gaff him. Gaff him!

459
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:12,341
One, two, three!

460
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:29,732
Pull him in.

461
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:42,702
Come on, a little bit more.

462
00:43:47,373 --> 00:43:49,124
So what do you think?

463
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:50,709
Do you think he'll like it?

464
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,878
He'll love it.

465
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:56,757
Enough to live with me in it?

466
00:43:57,007 --> 00:44:01,803
By now, honey, you know him
much better than I do.

467
00:44:02,888 --> 00:44:05,807
We're gonna make a go of it.

468
00:44:08,393 --> 00:44:11,728
I got confidence in you.

469
00:44:11,813 --> 00:44:15,275
What, are you putting me on?

470
00:44:16,651 --> 00:44:19,319
He's my precious boy.

471
00:44:19,569 --> 00:44:22,948
And you're the woman for him.

472
00:44:24,032 --> 00:44:27,828
That's something I don't joke about.

473
00:44:30,122 --> 00:44:33,125
The activity down near Bermuda
is deepening rapidly.

474
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:35,459
Given the warm and volatile
Gulf Stream...

475
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:40,297
...it won't take much to turn
this tropical storm into a hurricane.

476
00:44:40,548 --> 00:44:45,009
This just in, video of Sable Island.

477
00:45:31,262 --> 00:45:35,307
I put so much ground beef and sausage
in this, it weighed out at 20 pounds.

478
00:45:35,557 --> 00:45:37,309
More than most of our fish weigh.

479
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:39,393
Skipper say anything about us
coming up short?

480
00:45:39,645 --> 00:45:41,145
He's too scared to say.

481
00:45:41,395 --> 00:45:43,689
Skipper don't get scared.

482
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:46,025
Just disappointed.

483
00:45:46,275 --> 00:45:49,152
You know why this lasagna weighs
20 pounds?

484
00:45:49,404 --> 00:45:52,823
It tasted like you
threw in a shot put.

485
00:45:53,074 --> 00:45:56,202
I once worked a site
with a guy like you.

486
00:45:56,452 --> 00:45:59,913
The guy had a real bad accident.

487
00:46:00,246 --> 00:46:04,501
Can't even keep track of them
with so many accidents at sea.

488
00:46:04,751 --> 00:46:08,254
Tough to get an ambulance too.

489
00:46:11,091 --> 00:46:13,801
Keep it up.

490
00:46:15,512 --> 00:46:18,806
Highflyer!

491
00:46:21,976 --> 00:46:25,937
A.P., give me a hand.

492
00:46:25,937 --> 00:46:28,314
Hey, how about a little hand
over here?

493
00:46:28,565 --> 00:46:32,568
You do your job, I'll do mine.

494
00:46:32,944 --> 00:46:36,030
Come on, guys.

495
00:46:36,281 --> 00:46:37,656
Came out here for nothing.

496
00:46:37,907 --> 00:46:41,494
Keep moving, keep moving.

497
00:46:42,287 --> 00:46:46,790
Come on, Sully, let's get
some bait going here.

498
00:47:02,805 --> 00:47:04,139
It's big.

499
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:05,807
-Something very big.
-Fish on!

500
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:07,225
Come on, guys.

501
00:47:07,476 --> 00:47:08,560
Oh, yeah.

502
00:47:08,811 --> 00:47:12,230
Come on. Bring it up.

503
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:27,036
Bring it up.

504
00:47:29,163 --> 00:47:31,790
Get the gaff!

505
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:34,584
Get it out of here!

506
00:47:34,835 --> 00:47:39,048
Stick him.
Stick it in his head! Good!

507
00:47:44,845 --> 00:47:47,055
Get him off!

508
00:47:47,305 --> 00:47:50,599
-He's got my leg!
-Hang on!

509
00:47:52,977 --> 00:47:55,854
Kick your foot out! Kick it!
Kick your foot out.

510
00:47:56,104 --> 00:47:58,899
Get back!

511
00:48:01,818 --> 00:48:04,112
All right, come on, get it out!

512
00:48:04,363 --> 00:48:06,238
Get it out of here.

513
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:09,868
-Pull him back!
-Over the side.

514
00:48:10,118 --> 00:48:13,079
You all right?

515
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:21,086
You're short a boot, rookie!

516
00:48:21,169 --> 00:48:24,506
Beats a leg, don't it?

517
00:48:44,483 --> 00:48:48,320
Okay, we're getting a reading of winds
over 140 knots sustained.

518
00:48:48,571 --> 00:48:52,240
Looks like a category 5.

519
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:22,143
"Billy Tyne is no fine wine

520
00:49:22,227 --> 00:49:24,979
He's lost his touch with our long line

521
00:49:25,229 --> 00:49:29,609
Steamed here and there and all about

522
00:49:29,859 --> 00:49:31,818
What's our tally?

523
00:49:32,068 --> 00:49:35,196
We've struck out"

524
00:49:39,577 --> 00:49:43,872
All right, okay.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

525
00:49:54,548 --> 00:49:58,134
Why aren't you downstairs
watching the movie?

526
00:49:58,384 --> 00:50:00,553
One of our three movies?

527
00:50:00,804 --> 00:50:04,015
I know them all by heart.

528
00:50:06,101 --> 00:50:07,852
Skip...

529
00:50:08,102 --> 00:50:11,104
...what are you gonna do
about those sets? They suck.

530
00:50:11,357 --> 00:50:14,651
We ain't doing nothing.

531
00:50:14,734 --> 00:50:16,777
The boys been talking?

532
00:50:17,027 --> 00:50:19,905
About how I lost it?

533
00:50:20,156 --> 00:50:24,660
Billy Tyne's lost it? Gets a little
slow, they'll draw and quarter you.

534
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:27,328
I just didn't think
you'd go along with it.

535
00:50:27,579 --> 00:50:31,291
I come here because I need the money.
I'm trying for a new start.

536
00:50:31,541 --> 00:50:33,834
Last trip I thought you had
something to offer.

537
00:50:34,085 --> 00:50:37,046
But all in all,
you're just a little punk.

538
00:50:37,297 --> 00:50:41,008
-You promised me a shitload of fish!
-You'll get a shitload of fish.

539
00:50:41,259 --> 00:50:44,595
I've been in bad patches so many times
and came home with so much stock...

540
00:50:44,845 --> 00:50:47,639
...little boys like you had to
pack it on the pier.

541
00:50:47,889 --> 00:50:50,433
I always find the fish! Always!

542
00:50:50,685 --> 00:50:55,271
And I will this time!
So don't fuck with me!

543
00:50:55,896 --> 00:50:59,024
Aye, aye, skip.

544
00:51:12,997 --> 00:51:14,581
Put them closer!

545
00:51:14,831 --> 00:51:18,793
Murph, closer!
Give them a goddamn banquet.

546
00:51:19,043 --> 00:51:21,211
Aye, aye, cap.

547
00:51:21,462 --> 00:51:23,881
You heard him, boys.
Boss ain't happy.

548
00:51:24,132 --> 00:51:27,134
Double-time.

549
00:51:27,634 --> 00:51:30,178
Let's go, Bob.

550
00:51:32,472 --> 00:51:34,098
Sullivan!

551
00:51:34,349 --> 00:51:36,768
I gotta hit you with a fish again
to get you to work?

552
00:51:37,019 --> 00:51:38,352
Lightsticks, now!

553
00:51:38,604 --> 00:51:40,313
Shut up, asshole!

554
00:51:40,563 --> 00:51:43,858
You couldn't bait fish in a barrel!

555
00:51:44,109 --> 00:51:47,028
-Come on.
-See what I got to deal with?

556
00:51:47,279 --> 00:51:48,946
That's a landlubber.
What an idiot!

557
00:51:49,196 --> 00:51:52,198
Come on, Sully.
What are you, a fisherman or a farmer?

558
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:53,993
Bugs, help him out.

559
00:51:54,243 --> 00:51:56,620
Hurry up, before the captain sees.

560
00:51:56,871 --> 00:52:00,041
Okay, sure, I'll help him out.
What a screwup!

561
00:52:00,291 --> 00:52:03,501
-You're useless, Sully!
-Lay off, Bugs. You never screw up?

562
00:52:03,752 --> 00:52:06,504
You're nothing but a pimple
on the ass of progress.

563
00:52:06,755 --> 00:52:08,756
I've been on a better slab than this.

564
00:52:09,007 --> 00:52:12,134
I've had it with this.

565
00:52:19,768 --> 00:52:23,103
Take it easy.
It was an accident.

566
00:52:26,982 --> 00:52:30,235
You got the easiest job on the boat,
and you manage to screw it up!

567
00:52:30,485 --> 00:52:35,030
Kiss my ass, you little runt.
And you--!

568
00:52:35,949 --> 00:52:38,451
Murph!

569
00:52:40,954 --> 00:52:44,706
Cap, man overboard!

570
00:52:52,089 --> 00:52:55,383
Take the wheel!

571
00:53:10,439 --> 00:53:13,567
Back her down slow.

572
00:53:58,692 --> 00:54:01,820
Come on, Murph.

573
00:54:02,613 --> 00:54:05,781
We've got Murph!

574
00:54:13,372 --> 00:54:16,208
Come on!

575
00:54:34,017 --> 00:54:37,561
You all right? You all right?

576
00:54:40,815 --> 00:54:43,275
Come on, Murph.

577
00:54:43,525 --> 00:54:46,152
Come on.

578
00:54:47,613 --> 00:54:50,323
Come on.

579
00:55:05,755 --> 00:55:07,506
How was the water, Murph?

580
00:55:07,757 --> 00:55:11,301
Welcome back, Murph!

581
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:15,680
You did it, Murph.

582
00:55:21,144 --> 00:55:23,813
Hold on a minute.

583
00:55:28,484 --> 00:55:31,988
All right, bend over.

584
00:55:32,613 --> 00:55:35,156
Tetanus.

585
00:55:37,242 --> 00:55:39,327
Who's the hero?

586
00:55:39,578 --> 00:55:42,580
Bobby and Sully.

587
00:55:42,831 --> 00:55:45,625
Sully?

588
00:55:49,169 --> 00:55:52,172
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dale Murphy out of Cortez, Florida.

589
00:55:52,424 --> 00:55:55,885
The only fish the "Andrea Gail" has
hooked in three days.

590
00:55:56,135 --> 00:55:57,428
How you feeling?

591
00:55:57,678 --> 00:56:00,054
All right.

592
00:56:00,306 --> 00:56:04,435
-Bobby, thank you.
-Don't worry about it.

593
00:56:06,185 --> 00:56:10,023
Sully was the first one to go in.

594
00:56:13,818 --> 00:56:17,780
So I guess you're the big hero here.

595
00:56:18,031 --> 00:56:21,325
Well, you'd have done the same for me.

596
00:56:21,575 --> 00:56:24,786
Isn't that what I'm supposed to say?

597
00:56:25,954 --> 00:56:29,124
Well, you can say what you want...

598
00:56:29,374 --> 00:56:32,043
...but I'm glad you know how to swim.

599
00:56:32,294 --> 00:56:35,589
That's real big of you, Murph.

600
00:56:36,006 --> 00:56:38,716
It's all I can manage now.

601
00:56:38,966 --> 00:56:41,176
All right?

602
00:56:41,427 --> 00:56:44,429
I'll work on it.

603
00:56:48,476 --> 00:56:51,353
Tough guy.

604
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:04,531
This weather fax just came in.

605
00:57:04,823 --> 00:57:07,868
Edie, have a look at this.

606
00:57:08,118 --> 00:57:11,788
We have got to head in now!
Put it in at Watch Hill!

607
00:57:12,039 --> 00:57:13,749
In this stuff, harbor's too dangerous.

608
00:57:13,999 --> 00:57:14,749
Dangerous?

609
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,126
Dash into shore,
cut across shipping lanes--

610
00:57:17,377 --> 00:57:20,171
This is a hurricane
coming straight at us!

611
00:57:20,422 --> 00:57:23,424
Let me reduce sails, Sandy,
or even go back home.

612
00:57:23,675 --> 00:57:24,633
This is my boat.

613
00:57:24,884 --> 00:57:27,720
We'll ride this thing out.
Not for fun, for safety.

614
00:57:27,971 --> 00:57:32,599
Do what I've always done:
Go with the flow.

615
00:57:47,072 --> 00:57:50,741
Holy shit! Rogue wave!

616
00:57:50,992 --> 00:57:53,870
Look out!

617
00:58:07,257 --> 00:58:09,758
Everybody here?

618
00:58:20,227 --> 00:58:24,981
Captain, the boys would like
to have a word with you.

619
00:58:26,609 --> 00:58:29,485
Take over.

620
00:58:48,128 --> 00:58:51,215
When this meeting's over,
straighten this crap up.

621
00:58:51,465 --> 00:58:54,550
So what's the word?

622
00:58:55,218 --> 00:58:57,845
We're starting to get
an unlucky feeling out here.

623
00:58:58,096 --> 00:59:00,806
Murph going over, the shark,
a rogue wave....

624
00:59:01,057 --> 00:59:03,601
Yeah, what else?

625
00:59:03,726 --> 00:59:07,812
Never mind unlucky.
We're just looking for some fish.

626
00:59:08,063 --> 00:59:11,858
We had slumps before, you and l,
but nothing like this.

627
00:59:12,108 --> 00:59:15,529
You boys look like you got busted
in a brawl in Scollay Square.

628
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:19,282
That's how we feel.
We want to go home.

629
00:59:19,533 --> 00:59:23,537
You want to go home? You lonely for
that young mama who was all over you?

630
00:59:23,787 --> 00:59:25,788
My girl is none of your business.

631
00:59:26,038 --> 00:59:31,042
But you are. If you don't like it,
get the hell off! All of you.

632
00:59:32,878 --> 00:59:36,382
I look around and all I see are
little boys sitting on their asses...

633
00:59:36,632 --> 00:59:38,675
...too scared to go
and get some pay dirt.

634
00:59:38,925 --> 00:59:42,303
Pay dirt? What are you talking about?
Where the hell is that?

635
00:59:42,555 --> 00:59:44,055
We covered the Grand Banks.

636
00:59:44,305 --> 00:59:48,685
The Grand Banks are west of us.
I'm headed east.

637
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:51,353
The Flemish Cap.

638
00:59:53,064 --> 00:59:55,023
The Flemish Cap?

639
00:59:55,275 --> 00:59:59,862
Why don't we steam to Portugal
while we're at it?

640
01:00:03,323 --> 01:00:07,202
So this is the moment of truth.

641
01:00:08,704 --> 01:00:12,583
This is where they separate
the men from the boys.

642
01:00:15,585 --> 01:00:18,378
How about it?

643
01:00:19,714 --> 01:00:21,506
-Are you Gloucestermen?
-Yeah.

644
01:00:21,757 --> 01:00:25,094
But why go all the way
to the Flemish Cap to prove it?

645
01:00:25,344 --> 01:00:28,430
Tell him, Alfred Pierre.

646
01:00:29,431 --> 01:00:32,559
That's where the fish are.

647
01:00:34,186 --> 01:00:36,270
Do we have any other choice?

648
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:40,608
Yeah. Crawl home, busted.

649
01:00:47,281 --> 01:00:50,450
-All right, skip.
-All right.

650
01:00:50,701 --> 01:00:53,411
All right.

651
01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:02,170
Whiskey-Yankee-Charlie, 6-6-8- 1,
do you read me?

652
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:06,799
This is "Andrea Gail," Whiskey-
Yankee-Charlie, 6-6-8-1 . Hey, Linda.

653
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:09,844
What's happening?

654
01:01:10,094 --> 01:01:11,678
Slim to none. Where are you?

655
01:01:11,929 --> 01:01:15,306
Tail of the Banks.
Kicking up something wicked here.

656
01:01:15,557 --> 01:01:16,850
Made a couple of sets.

657
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:18,100
You doing any good?

658
01:01:18,352 --> 01:01:22,813
Nine, first set. Twelve--
No, make that a baker's dozen, second.

659
01:01:23,065 --> 01:01:25,191
Got a couple of markers to boot.

660
01:01:25,441 --> 01:01:28,527
Your hand is so hot,
I can feel the heat from here.

661
01:01:28,778 --> 01:01:32,114
-I've asked you to team up.
-I don't like partners.

662
01:01:32,365 --> 01:01:33,782
Business-wise, that is.

663
01:01:34,032 --> 01:01:36,785
Okay, okay. What's your position?

664
01:01:37,036 --> 01:01:39,621
46 north, 48 west.

665
01:01:39,871 --> 01:01:41,330
You headed for the Flemish Cap?

666
01:01:41,581 --> 01:01:45,210
The lady knows her coordinates.
Yeah, I'm steaming full-bore.

667
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:47,378
The Flemish Cap is
nearly off the charts.

668
01:01:47,628 --> 01:01:49,255
What are you trying to prove?

669
01:01:49,506 --> 01:01:53,676
We got gale-force coming out
of Bermuda, stuff out of Sable Island.

670
01:01:53,926 --> 01:01:56,720
As for me, I'm staring here
at solid white chop.

671
01:01:56,971 --> 01:01:58,763
This could be a triple-header.

672
01:01:59,014 --> 01:02:01,517
You're behind me.
So is your weather.

673
01:02:01,767 --> 01:02:05,478
Yeah, but you've gotta go
through it to get back.

674
01:02:05,728 --> 01:02:07,187
Good point.

675
01:02:07,439 --> 01:02:10,400
Billy, you won't like this,
but I'm gonna say it anyway:

676
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:12,025
You be careful.

677
01:02:12,277 --> 01:02:15,196
Yes, Mother.

678
01:02:16,072 --> 01:02:19,992
Why don't we pick this up later?
I'm out.

679
01:02:38,593 --> 01:02:41,220
-You guys use some company?
-Sure.

680
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:44,890
-Coffee?
-Yeah, thanks.

681
01:02:45,015 --> 01:02:48,226
--in the mid-Atlantic,
moving rapidly northeast...

682
01:02:48,477 --> 01:02:50,061
...30-foot waves.

683
01:02:50,312 --> 01:02:51,312
What'd you hear?

684
01:02:51,563 --> 01:02:53,607
They're out on the Flemish Cap.

685
01:02:53,857 --> 01:02:57,902
I got it straight from big Bob Brown.

686
01:02:57,943 --> 01:02:59,445
Yeah.

687
01:02:59,696 --> 01:03:02,156
The Flemish Cap.

688
01:03:02,406 --> 01:03:05,576
I went there, '62.

689
01:03:05,827 --> 01:03:08,370
Lots of fish.

690
01:03:08,621 --> 01:03:10,622
And lots of weather.

691
01:03:10,873 --> 01:03:12,041
Hurricanes...

692
01:03:12,291 --> 01:03:14,375
...squalls, huge seas.

693
01:03:14,627 --> 01:03:17,838
You're full of shit, Quentin.

694
01:03:18,047 --> 01:03:19,964
That's right.

695
01:03:20,215 --> 01:03:22,883
I am.

696
01:04:54,263 --> 01:04:57,262
-Where are you going?
-To point this boat up into the storm.

697
01:04:57,847 --> 01:04:59,638
And scream for help!

698
01:04:59,890 --> 01:05:03,727
We lie ahull, beam to the waves,
slip sideways. Standard procedure.

699
01:05:03,977 --> 01:05:07,688
Forget it, we won't make it!
Missy, get on the radio now!

700
01:05:07,938 --> 01:05:09,480
-We can make it.
-Mayday!

701
01:05:09,732 --> 01:05:12,609
It's sopping wet!
She'll be weeping in the wind. No!

702
01:05:12,859 --> 01:05:15,069
We stay below and ride this thing out.

703
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:17,236
Remember, this is my boat!

704
01:05:17,487 --> 01:05:19,489
This is my life!

705
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:22,115
Go, Melissa!

706
01:05:25,577 --> 01:05:26,620
Mayday!

707
01:05:26,871 --> 01:05:30,123
Mayday! Mayday!

708
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:36,003
We're a 32-foot
sailing vessel, "Mistral."

709
01:05:36,253 --> 01:05:39,672
Our position is...

710
01:05:39,797 --> 01:05:42,799
...39.49 north--

711
01:05:43,342 --> 01:05:46,928
Mayday! Mayday!

712
01:05:47,553 --> 01:05:50,264
Over.

713
01:06:18,369 --> 01:06:20,913
Hey, cap!

714
01:06:27,168 --> 01:06:30,544
Ice machine's had it.
It's dead.

715
01:06:31,546 --> 01:06:33,965
-Check the evaporator?
-Yeah.

716
01:06:34,216 --> 01:06:35,967
-Freon?
-Plenty, but nowhere to flow.

717
01:06:36,217 --> 01:06:37,467
Use some spit and glue.

718
01:06:37,718 --> 01:06:40,095
I did. She's fried, skip.

719
01:06:40,345 --> 01:06:41,929
I told Brown, get us a new one...

720
01:06:42,181 --> 01:06:46,101
...but he gets another overhaul,
son of a bitch!

721
01:06:49,602 --> 01:06:52,271
Sorry.

722
01:06:58,819 --> 01:07:02,071
The ice machine's gone.

723
01:07:02,530 --> 01:07:05,448
Oh, fuck.

724
01:07:11,704 --> 01:07:13,914
All right,
we got good ice on them now.

725
01:07:14,164 --> 01:07:15,790
We seal the fish hold.

726
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:20,461
With luck, we'll deliver
the catch and set the market.

727
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:23,546
Pull up the gear.

728
01:07:24,172 --> 01:07:27,049
We're going home.

729
01:07:28,676 --> 01:07:33,013
Put these babies on ice,
and we're out of here!

730
01:07:51,068 --> 01:07:56,280
We are taking heavy waves.
Damage on deck.

731
01:07:57,407 --> 01:07:59,491
Need immediate assistance.

732
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:02,994
We're beam to the sea
and taking on water.

733
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:06,623
Just so you understand
what we're up against.

734
01:08:06,873 --> 01:08:11,293
We're looking at 40 to 50-foot waves,
gale-force winds. A real bad one.

735
01:08:11,543 --> 01:08:13,503
Right in our path.

736
01:08:13,754 --> 01:08:16,171
The Weather Service
is jerking off again.

737
01:08:16,422 --> 01:08:18,341
No.

738
01:08:18,591 --> 01:08:20,257
You're afraid?

739
01:08:20,508 --> 01:08:22,886
I never seen you scared.

740
01:08:23,136 --> 01:08:26,639
It's pretty rough stuff out there,
that's for sure.

741
01:08:26,889 --> 01:08:29,849
We either hang out here
for a few days till it calms down--

742
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:31,226
But, cap...

743
01:08:31,476 --> 01:08:34,061
...we got 60,000 pounds of fish here.

744
01:08:34,312 --> 01:08:36,022
Are we gonna let it spoil?

745
01:08:36,272 --> 01:08:39,273
I thought we were gonna
set the market, make a killing.

746
01:08:39,523 --> 01:08:42,692
Or we say the hell with it.

747
01:08:42,944 --> 01:08:46,404
We drive right through it.

748
01:08:52,952 --> 01:08:56,496
You said we're Gloucestermen.

749
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,501
What do you say, guys?

750
01:09:02,751 --> 01:09:05,377
Are we or aren't we?

751
01:09:05,628 --> 01:09:07,004
Did we come out here for nothing?

752
01:09:07,363 --> 01:09:09,614
-It's a lot of money.
-Let's make some money.

753
01:09:09,864 --> 01:09:13,701
Come on. Let's hear it, Gloucester!

754
01:09:13,951 --> 01:09:17,664
Let's get her lashed down.
Bugs, put the birds in the water.

755
01:09:17,915 --> 01:09:21,417
Birds in. Got it, skip.

756
01:09:28,509 --> 01:09:31,053
Look. Look at this.

757
01:09:31,303 --> 01:09:35,015
We got Hurricane Grace moving north
off the Atlantic seaboard.

758
01:09:35,265 --> 01:09:36,517
Huge...

759
01:09:36,768 --> 01:09:38,769
...getting massive.

760
01:09:39,019 --> 01:09:43,607
Two, this low south of Sable Island,
ready to explode.

761
01:09:43,857 --> 01:09:45,318
Look at this.

762
01:09:45,568 --> 01:09:50,490
Three, a fresh cold front
swooping down from Canada.

763
01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:52,909
But it's caught a ride
on the jet stream...

764
01:09:53,159 --> 01:09:56,329
...and is motoring hell-bent
towards the Atlantic.

765
01:09:56,579 --> 01:09:57,622
Cool.

766
01:09:57,872 --> 01:09:59,959
Wait, wait.

767
01:10:00,209 --> 01:10:03,003
What if Hurricane Grace
runs smack into it?

768
01:10:03,253 --> 01:10:07,550
Add to the scenario this baby off
Sable Island, scrounging for energy.

769
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:11,512
She'll start feeding off
both the Canadian cold front...

770
01:10:11,762 --> 01:10:14,180
...and Hurricane Grace.

771
01:10:14,432 --> 01:10:16,476
You could be a meteorologist
all your life...

772
01:10:16,727 --> 01:10:19,479
...and never see something like this.

773
01:10:20,022 --> 01:10:24,192
It would be a disaster
of epic proportions.

774
01:10:24,443 --> 01:10:25,777
It would be...

775
01:10:26,028 --> 01:10:29,447
...the perfect storm.

776
01:10:39,416 --> 01:10:41,626
Let's get down below.

777
01:10:41,877 --> 01:10:43,462
Bobby?

778
01:10:43,712 --> 01:10:46,798
I want you up here with me.

779
01:11:00,813 --> 01:11:04,942
Mayday! Mayday!

780
01:11:07,987 --> 01:11:11,699
"Sailing vessel" Mistral,
this is Coast Guard rescue.

781
01:11:11,949 --> 01:11:14,661
Sandy!

782
01:11:15,912 --> 01:11:20,583
Edie, they heard me!
They're coming!

783
01:11:30,094 --> 01:11:32,055
Air Force rescue 2-3- 1.

784
01:11:32,304 --> 01:11:34,139
We've located the "Mistral."

785
01:11:34,391 --> 01:11:36,684
Position: 39.49 north...

786
01:11:36,934 --> 01:11:40,563
...69.52 west.

787
01:11:41,689 --> 01:11:43,191
How far's that last position?

788
01:11:43,441 --> 01:11:45,318
About 20.3 miles, captain.

789
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:48,989
OD, boatswain on the bridge.

790
01:11:52,659 --> 01:11:55,744
Tallyho, there they are.

791
01:11:59,790 --> 01:12:02,876
-Okay, guys, showtime.
-You got it.

792
01:12:03,127 --> 01:12:04,921
"Mistral", this is 2-3-1 .

793
01:12:05,171 --> 01:12:08,550
We're gonna extract you
one at a time from the deck.

794
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:11,177
Hey, Jeremy, I don't like this.

795
01:12:11,428 --> 01:12:14,723
-Clock's ticking.
-Come on, we better get them off now.

796
01:12:14,973 --> 01:12:16,099
Get closer, Darryl.

797
01:12:16,349 --> 01:12:19,144
Just a little closer.

798
01:12:22,731 --> 01:12:25,567
Okay, deploying the basket.

799
01:12:25,817 --> 01:12:27,360
Close to 2:00.

800
01:12:27,612 --> 01:12:29,238
Let's come right to 5.

801
01:12:29,488 --> 01:12:31,575
-Four. Three.
-Son of a bitch.

802
01:12:31,825 --> 01:12:33,743
Stop there. Hold your hover.

803
01:12:33,993 --> 01:12:35,120
Goddamn it!

804
01:12:35,370 --> 01:12:39,249
Keep it steady, keep it steady.

805
01:12:39,666 --> 01:12:42,210
Shit!

806
01:12:47,299 --> 01:12:49,092
Man out!

807
01:12:49,343 --> 01:12:53,096
-Shear the cable!
-No, I got it!

808
01:13:09,154 --> 01:13:10,156
Shit.

809
01:13:10,406 --> 01:13:13,409
Bring up the basket!

810
01:13:15,578 --> 01:13:17,497
Sandy!

811
01:13:17,747 --> 01:13:18,956
Hold on!

812
01:13:19,207 --> 01:13:20,584
I got you!

813
01:13:20,834 --> 01:13:23,251
-Basket's in.
-Looks like I'm going for a swim.

814
01:13:23,502 --> 01:13:24,671
Okay, go get them.

815
01:13:24,921 --> 01:13:27,297
Mitchell off intercom.

816
01:13:27,547 --> 01:13:30,550
It's time to get wet.

817
01:13:31,301 --> 01:13:34,930
We're gonna be all right.

818
01:13:35,014 --> 01:13:37,518
Go.

819
01:14:11,636 --> 01:14:13,555
Altitude.

820
01:14:13,806 --> 01:14:17,434
Altitude. Get her up, get her up!

821
01:14:21,647 --> 01:14:24,315
He's in the water.

822
01:14:26,736 --> 01:14:28,319
I'm going after him!

823
01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:31,490
No, no, wait! Stand by!

824
01:14:32,282 --> 01:14:35,369
Jonesy, hold on.

825
01:14:42,753 --> 01:14:44,297
There! He's okay.

826
01:14:44,547 --> 01:14:48,842
This isn't working.
They'll have to get in the water.

827
01:14:58,601 --> 01:15:01,313
Come on, come on!

828
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:03,065
You're having a blast, huh?

829
01:15:03,315 --> 01:15:06,526
-Want a turn?
-No, just watch. I want to watch.

830
01:15:06,776 --> 01:15:09,613
I'm studying up for the day
I get my own boat.

831
01:15:09,863 --> 01:15:11,573
Your own boat, huh?

832
01:15:11,823 --> 01:15:15,744
Want to give me a hand?
Grab the throttle.

833
01:15:16,995 --> 01:15:19,915
Hang on.

834
01:15:21,458 --> 01:15:23,252
-Ah, shit!
-Seven K, six easy.

835
01:15:23,503 --> 01:15:25,337
-Eight minimum.
-Ten.

836
01:15:25,587 --> 01:15:28,882
You know, I'm gonna get me
a new used Ford F-150...

837
01:15:29,132 --> 01:15:31,094
...take a ride to Digby with Irene.

838
01:15:31,344 --> 01:15:35,473
Going to get drunk, eat like a pig
and sleep like a child!

839
01:15:35,723 --> 01:15:38,726
Fish and fun-gee!

840
01:15:40,603 --> 01:15:46,442
Okay, Jer, too risky to go lower.
You gotta jump from here.

841
01:16:01,209 --> 01:16:04,671
Good afternoon, madam.
I'm Sergeant Jeremy Mitchell.

842
01:16:04,921 --> 01:16:07,382
I'll be your para-rescue jumper today.

843
01:16:07,633 --> 01:16:09,092
How are you?

844
01:16:09,342 --> 01:16:12,429
Okay so far.

845
01:16:26,776 --> 01:16:31,406
Keep your hands
and feet in the basket.

846
01:16:33,950 --> 01:16:35,201
-Careful.
-Okay!

847
01:16:35,452 --> 01:16:38,621
All right, here we go.

848
01:16:44,419 --> 01:16:46,881
You're next.

849
01:16:57,059 --> 01:16:58,977
That was nothing!

850
01:16:59,227 --> 01:17:01,772
Come on!

851
01:17:14,701 --> 01:17:16,829
Oh, my God.

852
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:20,166
It's happening.

853
01:17:56,369 --> 01:18:01,082
Andrea Gail, Andrea Gail.
This is "Hannah Boden."

854
01:18:04,128 --> 01:18:06,839
--Billy, over.

855
01:18:07,047 --> 01:18:09,718
Calling the "Andrea Gail."

856
01:18:14,681 --> 01:18:17,058
"Andrea Gail," do you read me?

857
01:18:17,308 --> 01:18:19,435
Do you read me? Come in!

858
01:18:19,685 --> 01:18:23,772
Come in, for God's sake, come in!
Billy, these storms have collided!

859
01:18:24,023 --> 01:18:26,943
They are exploding!

860
01:18:27,902 --> 01:18:29,612
Who is it?

861
01:18:29,863 --> 01:18:30,655
I don't know.

862
01:18:30,905 --> 01:18:33,742
"Andrea Gail," come in!

863
01:18:33,992 --> 01:18:37,037
Whiskey-Yankee-Charlie 6-6-8-1, over.

864
01:18:37,287 --> 01:18:38,747
Talk to me, Billy, over.

865
01:18:38,997 --> 01:18:42,917
I repeat,
Whiskey-Yankee-Charlie 6-6-8-1 --

866
01:18:43,544 --> 01:18:45,920
Look at your fax, damn it!
Look at your fax!

867
01:18:46,171 --> 01:18:49,216
Whiskey-Yankee-Charlie 6-6-8-1, over!

868
01:18:49,467 --> 01:18:51,844
-Where are you, Billy?
-Linda?

869
01:18:52,094 --> 01:18:53,262
Give me the coordinates.

870
01:18:53,512 --> 01:18:56,640
-44 north, 56.4 west.
-We're 44 north...

871
01:18:56,891 --> 01:18:59,852
...56.4 west, headed west.

872
01:19:00,102 --> 01:19:05,691
I repeat, 44 north,
56.4 west, headed--

873
01:19:05,942 --> 01:19:07,484
Over.

874
01:19:07,735 --> 01:19:10,530
Billy, get out of there.

875
01:19:10,781 --> 01:19:14,159
Come about! Let it carry you out!
What the hell are you doing?

876
01:19:14,409 --> 01:19:16,994
Hang on!

877
01:19:17,204 --> 01:19:20,498
Billy! Billy, for chrissake!

878
01:19:20,748 --> 01:19:25,796
You're steaming into a bomb!
Turn around, for chrissake!

879
01:19:26,755 --> 01:19:27,798
It's the antenna.

880
01:19:28,048 --> 01:19:30,342
Billy, can you hear me?

881
01:19:30,592 --> 01:19:35,681
You're headed right
for the middle of the monster.

882
01:19:43,773 --> 01:19:47,109
Oh, my God.

883
01:19:54,575 --> 01:19:57,120
Hang on!

884
01:19:57,370 --> 01:19:58,830
Take the wheel.

885
01:19:59,081 --> 01:20:02,000
No, I'll go.

886
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:04,335
Mayday, mayday, mayday...

887
01:20:04,585 --> 01:20:06,880
...Coast Guard Boston.

888
01:20:07,131 --> 01:20:10,216
This is fishing vessel "Hannah Boden"
relaying a mayday...

889
01:20:10,467 --> 01:20:12,720
...for swordboat "Andrea Gail."

890
01:20:12,969 --> 01:20:16,140
Last position, 44 north...

891
01:20:16,391 --> 01:20:20,562
...56.4 west, over.

892
01:20:20,812 --> 01:20:25,108
Advise you proceed to next incident
at your discretion, over.

893
01:20:25,358 --> 01:20:27,110
Yeah, roger, Boston.

894
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:30,239
I just got a mayday on a Gloucester
swordboat, the "Andrea Gail."

895
01:20:30,488 --> 01:20:35,075
44 north, 56.4 west, headed west.

896
01:20:35,325 --> 01:20:37,871
Jesus. That's straight into hell.

897
01:20:38,121 --> 01:20:40,915
Gloucester.
They're always from Gloucester.

898
01:20:41,166 --> 01:20:44,919
It's an increased-risk mission,
so, you know, it's up to us.

899
01:20:45,170 --> 01:20:47,297
I'm getting
a little air-to-air feeling.

900
01:20:47,547 --> 01:20:49,591
Refuel in hell?
That's pretty sporty.

901
01:20:49,841 --> 01:20:52,010
Call the cutter.
We're coming in hot.

902
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:55,305
People, slight change of plans!

903
01:20:55,555 --> 01:20:58,475
We're gonna drop you on
the Coast Guard cutter "Tamaroa."

904
01:20:58,725 --> 01:21:03,355
We got some swordfishermen
who have lost their way.

905
01:21:03,355 --> 01:21:06,441
Or their minds.

906
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:48,236
This is rescue 2-3-1
on final approach.

907
01:21:48,486 --> 01:21:52,657
Rescue 2-3-1, flight deck is green.

908
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:55,284
There it is.
You're being waved in.

909
01:21:55,535 --> 01:21:57,121
Thirty meters and closing.

910
01:21:57,371 --> 01:21:59,705
Twenty-five meters, winds 43.

911
01:21:59,955 --> 01:22:02,457
Set a line at 0-1-0.

912
01:22:02,708 --> 01:22:05,044
Beautiful. We're coming.

913
01:22:05,294 --> 01:22:06,462
Watch this wave, cap.

914
01:22:06,712 --> 01:22:08,715
2-3-1, looking good.
Transfer at will.

915
01:22:08,965 --> 01:22:11,550
Drop ladder.

916
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:14,887
All right, send them down.

917
01:22:15,138 --> 01:22:16,764
Put your foot out.

918
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:17,849
Left leg out.

919
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:21,519
Mind your helm, goddamn it.

920
01:22:22,478 --> 01:22:24,814
Watch the deck!

921
01:22:25,064 --> 01:22:26,942
Come on.

922
01:22:27,193 --> 01:22:28,861
First survivor on deck.

923
01:22:29,111 --> 01:22:33,490
-Where's our fuel?
-Refueling tanker is on the way.

924
01:22:33,741 --> 01:22:35,702
Second survivor on deck.

925
01:22:35,952 --> 01:22:38,621
Jesus.

926
01:23:37,557 --> 01:23:40,060
It's gone.

927
01:23:41,019 --> 01:23:46,191
No antenna, no radio.
We're back in the 19th century.

928
01:23:48,777 --> 01:23:51,655
You want to call it quits,
turn around?

929
01:23:51,905 --> 01:23:54,450
What do you think?

930
01:23:54,909 --> 01:23:56,660
I think she's a hell of a boat.

931
01:23:56,910 --> 01:23:58,246
With a hell of a crew.

932
01:23:58,496 --> 01:24:01,331
And a hell of a skipper.

933
01:24:04,627 --> 01:24:06,546
All right then, Gloucester...

934
01:24:06,796 --> 01:24:09,716
...we're coming home!

935
01:24:28,444 --> 01:24:30,070
Take the wheel!

936
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:31,237
Skipper, don't!

937
01:24:31,487 --> 01:24:36,035
Take the goddamn wheel!
That's an order!

938
01:24:45,253 --> 01:24:48,673
Damn, I can't see anything.

939
01:24:53,635 --> 01:24:56,473
What's the gauge say?

940
01:24:56,723 --> 01:24:59,476
It's low, Jonesy.
Where are they?

941
01:24:59,726 --> 01:25:04,189
-Tanker's on the way.
-How many stops are they making?

942
01:25:05,482 --> 01:25:07,984
No!

943
01:25:08,443 --> 01:25:10,945
Come on! Not again.

944
01:25:11,196 --> 01:25:13,406
Hello? Ethel, thank God!

945
01:25:13,656 --> 01:25:17,243
I'm going crazy here.
Even the weather guy's gone bananas.

946
01:25:17,494 --> 01:25:21,415
Have you heard from--?
Hello? Ethel?

947
01:25:21,665 --> 01:25:24,250
Shit!

948
01:25:46,065 --> 01:25:48,193
There she is! Thank God.

949
01:25:48,444 --> 01:25:51,613
Let's fill her up, save these yahoos
and get out of here.

950
01:25:51,864 --> 01:25:53,950
King 1-2, we have visual.

951
01:25:54,199 --> 01:25:59,580
Air Force rescue 2-3-1,
you've got a wet hose.

952
01:26:50,549 --> 01:26:54,595
All right now, hold on!

953
01:27:09,736 --> 01:27:11,739
In the water!

954
01:27:11,989 --> 01:27:14,991
Hold on, skip!

955
01:28:02,124 --> 01:28:04,961
Shit.

956
01:28:28,693 --> 01:28:31,238
Come on, skip!

957
01:28:33,531 --> 01:28:37,410
Come on, skip, come on!

958
01:29:03,937 --> 01:29:06,358
Yeah!

959
01:29:12,864 --> 01:29:14,199
Anything yet?

960
01:29:14,449 --> 01:29:15,491
Nothing about boats.

961
01:29:15,741 --> 01:29:18,161
-I got four nines.
-He's a liar.

962
01:29:18,411 --> 01:29:21,122
Florence.

963
01:29:21,956 --> 01:29:24,250
Damage estimates
are in the high millions.

964
01:29:24,501 --> 01:29:26,169
Folks, the worst is yet to come.

965
01:29:26,419 --> 01:29:28,172
The storm of the century.

966
01:29:28,422 --> 01:29:31,466
Residents, stay inside,
pack sandbags against door frames.

967
01:29:31,716 --> 01:29:35,261
A report here that Cape Ann
fishing industry is in tatters.

968
01:29:35,512 --> 01:29:38,681
Lobstermen from Gloucester to Scituate
have lost their traps.

969
01:29:38,932 --> 01:29:43,187
"A missing swordboat," Andrea Gail,
out of Gloucester with a crew of six.

970
01:29:43,437 --> 01:29:46,648
An Air National Guard rescue
helicopter has been dispatched.

971
01:29:46,898 --> 01:29:51,862
At Logan International Airport,
flooded runways.

972
01:29:58,870 --> 01:30:01,664
We did it!

973
01:30:09,213 --> 01:30:11,633
-Get those windows boarded up!
-All right, skip.

974
01:30:11,883 --> 01:30:15,137
Come on, board it up!

975
01:30:18,683 --> 01:30:23,312
Tell those guys forget it.
We'll get our gas somewhere else.

976
01:30:34,657 --> 01:30:37,243
What do you think?

977
01:30:43,290 --> 01:30:46,461
We're running on fumes.

978
01:30:47,419 --> 01:30:50,214
King 1-2, this isn't gonna work.

979
01:30:50,465 --> 01:30:53,718
This is not our night.

980
01:30:54,510 --> 01:31:00,184
We're issuing a mayday.
Give the Coast Guard our coordinates.

981
01:31:00,350 --> 01:31:03,354
We're ditching.

982
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:09,400
Mayday, mayday, Air Force rescue 2-3-1
calling Coast Guard "Tamaroa."

983
01:31:09,650 --> 01:31:14,239
Mayday, mayday, Air Force rescue 2-3-1
calling Coast Guard "Tamaroa."

984
01:31:14,490 --> 01:31:18,577
King 1-2, departing the area.

985
01:31:21,289 --> 01:31:22,415
Come on!

986
01:31:22,665 --> 01:31:25,753
Let's get it up!

987
01:31:30,007 --> 01:31:33,427
All right, guys, get ready!

988
01:31:33,469 --> 01:31:34,762
Hold on!

989
01:31:35,012 --> 01:31:38,099
Get it up there!

990
01:31:40,016 --> 01:31:41,102
Get another one.

991
01:31:41,352 --> 01:31:43,979
Come on.

992
01:31:51,028 --> 01:31:55,574
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Grab them, grab them!

993
01:31:56,410 --> 01:31:59,871
Hang on, there's a swell!

994
01:32:08,337 --> 01:32:10,505
Come on, guys, try to get you close.

995
01:32:10,755 --> 01:32:14,385
-Stay together.
-Roger that.

996
01:32:18,472 --> 01:32:21,058
Number 1 is out!

997
01:32:21,225 --> 01:32:22,728
Bail! Bail out!

998
01:32:22,978 --> 01:32:27,607
-Leave yourself enough time, okay?
-I'll be fine.

999
01:32:37,242 --> 01:32:39,954
Go, Jonesy, go!

1000
01:32:42,749 --> 01:32:45,835
You're next.

1001
01:32:47,795 --> 01:32:50,798
Hold on, hold on!

1002
01:33:00,976 --> 01:33:02,770
Now, Jeremy, now!
Go! Bail out!

1003
01:33:03,019 --> 01:33:06,106
See you, Darryl.

1004
01:33:17,034 --> 01:33:20,954
No, no, no, no. No!

1005
01:34:33,071 --> 01:34:34,448
Over here!

1006
01:34:34,698 --> 01:34:39,244
We're over here!

1007
01:34:50,924 --> 01:34:53,134
Have you seen Mitchell?

1008
01:34:53,384 --> 01:34:54,303
No.

1009
01:34:54,553 --> 01:34:56,803
What about Jonesy?

1010
01:34:57,054 --> 01:34:59,307
Nothing. Just you.

1011
01:34:59,557 --> 01:35:03,227
Goddamn it, we don't lose anybody!

1012
01:35:08,107 --> 01:35:10,318
Come on, lay it on.

1013
01:35:10,568 --> 01:35:13,822
-Get it locked!
-Get them on!

1014
01:35:21,497 --> 01:35:23,164
They're not gonna make it!

1015
01:35:23,414 --> 01:35:26,919
Tell them to hold on.
I'll turn the boat.

1016
01:35:30,881 --> 01:35:33,717
Right now, let's go!

1017
01:35:37,721 --> 01:35:39,598
Come on, guys, you can do it!

1018
01:35:39,849 --> 01:35:43,435
It's jammed! It's jammed!

1019
01:35:45,938 --> 01:35:48,942
Lock it down!

1020
01:35:56,784 --> 01:35:59,578
I can't hold her!

1021
01:36:05,209 --> 01:36:06,752
Come on, get it up.

1022
01:36:07,002 --> 01:36:08,129
Put it on now!

1023
01:36:08,379 --> 01:36:10,924
Come on, this is it.

1024
01:36:11,173 --> 01:36:13,134
-Get it on.
-I'm trying!

1025
01:36:13,384 --> 01:36:15,761
Get it on.

1026
01:36:20,516 --> 01:36:23,519
It's loose. I got it!

1027
01:36:29,316 --> 01:36:30,735
Man overboard!

1028
01:36:30,985 --> 01:36:34,488
-What?!
-Two over the side.

1029
01:36:37,867 --> 01:36:39,744
Come on, help me!

1030
01:36:39,994 --> 01:36:42,663
Hold on, I got you!

1031
01:36:44,165 --> 01:36:47,168
Grab the line!

1032
01:36:58,139 --> 01:36:59,849
Oh, God.

1033
01:37:00,099 --> 01:37:03,520
We lost Bugsy!

1034
01:37:11,820 --> 01:37:14,280
Bugsy!

1035
01:37:34,259 --> 01:37:37,514
Hold on. Grab this.

1036
01:37:45,271 --> 01:37:48,107
Hold on!

1037
01:37:50,025 --> 01:37:54,029
Come on, Bugsy. Grab it!

1038
01:37:59,284 --> 01:38:01,787
Grab it!

1039
01:38:02,205 --> 01:38:04,709
Bugsy!

1040
01:38:36,699 --> 01:38:38,243
There! Right there!

1041
01:38:38,493 --> 01:38:41,997
Come on, let's go!

1042
01:38:55,844 --> 01:38:59,473
I'm here, Jeremy, I'm here.
I got you. We're here.

1043
01:38:59,723 --> 01:39:02,017
Hey, talk to me, J. Talk to me.

1044
01:39:02,267 --> 01:39:04,937
I'm all busted up, cap.

1045
01:39:05,188 --> 01:39:06,730
Can't breathe.

1046
01:39:06,981 --> 01:39:10,610
-Hey, Mitch, have you seen Jonesy?
-No.

1047
01:39:10,860 --> 01:39:15,322
Go find him. Go find Jonesy.
Go get him.

1048
01:39:54,321 --> 01:39:57,491
Boys, that's it.

1049
01:39:57,491 --> 01:40:00,285
We can't make it.

1050
01:40:05,165 --> 01:40:08,252
We're turning around.

1051
01:40:11,506 --> 01:40:13,842
Come on, cap, we can do it.

1052
01:40:14,093 --> 01:40:16,011
What about our catch?

1053
01:40:16,261 --> 01:40:19,348
We'll mug them next time.

1054
01:40:20,182 --> 01:40:23,018
This piece of water belongs to us.

1055
01:40:23,269 --> 01:40:27,481
The fish will gather again
for the "Andrea Gail..."

1056
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:32,362
...when we come back.

1057
01:40:32,946 --> 01:40:36,825
This is gonna be
the turnaround of all time.

1058
01:40:36,825 --> 01:40:39,034
Textbook.

1059
01:40:39,285 --> 01:40:42,454
So get ready.

1060
01:41:13,612 --> 01:41:17,741
If it were good news,
he would've called us.

1061
01:41:17,741 --> 01:41:21,496
The news is the rescue helicopter
had to ditch.

1062
01:41:21,746 --> 01:41:25,626
We can't raise the "Andrea Gail."

1063
01:41:26,292 --> 01:41:27,919
What does that mean?

1064
01:41:28,169 --> 01:41:30,130
We don't know anything.

1065
01:41:30,381 --> 01:41:34,134
If anyone can survive this storm,
it's Billy Tyne. I'll give him that.

1066
01:41:34,385 --> 01:41:36,177
What do you want?

1067
01:41:36,428 --> 01:41:39,305
Credit for having the guts
to walk in here?

1068
01:41:39,555 --> 01:41:40,933
I do.

1069
01:41:41,183 --> 01:41:43,435
Give it to him.

1070
01:41:43,684 --> 01:41:45,229
How you doing, Quentin?

1071
01:41:45,479 --> 01:41:47,731
Pretty good, governor.

1072
01:41:47,981 --> 01:41:49,983
You're counting your money.

1073
01:41:50,234 --> 01:41:55,197
And my guy is out there risking
his life for a bunch of stupid fish.

1074
01:41:55,448 --> 01:41:57,408
That's the game.

1075
01:41:57,658 --> 01:42:01,578
I hate the game.
I hate the goddamn game!

1076
01:42:01,829 --> 01:42:02,830
Do you hear me?!

1077
01:42:03,081 --> 01:42:05,999
Do you read me, governor?
Do you?!

1078
01:42:06,250 --> 01:42:09,503
Do you read me?!

1079
01:42:16,093 --> 01:42:17,761
Did you see him?

1080
01:42:18,011 --> 01:42:21,181
I don't see anything!

1081
01:42:24,101 --> 01:42:28,313
Look! There's the cutter.

1082
01:42:35,030 --> 01:42:39,201
-Have them put out the cargo net.
-Cargo net, aye, sir.

1083
01:42:39,452 --> 01:42:41,579
Put me alongside them.

1084
01:42:41,829 --> 01:42:45,374
I want five men on that net.
And get the light out there.

1085
01:42:45,624 --> 01:42:48,795
Okay, guys, hook in!

1086
01:42:49,879 --> 01:42:51,255
Pick it up! Move!

1087
01:42:51,505 --> 01:42:53,341
Keep your light on those swimmers!

1088
01:42:53,591 --> 01:42:55,676
Get ready!

1089
01:42:55,926 --> 01:42:58,929
Release the net now!

1090
01:42:59,180 --> 01:43:01,975
Okay, now, Jeremy, swim!

1091
01:43:02,225 --> 01:43:05,479
Swim!

1092
01:43:15,406 --> 01:43:16,823
Give him a hand!

1093
01:43:17,074 --> 01:43:19,327
Get ready!

1094
01:43:19,577 --> 01:43:22,496
Come on!

1095
01:43:53,153 --> 01:43:56,072
All right! Let's do it again.

1096
01:43:56,322 --> 01:43:58,617
If they can't get to us,
we'll get to them.

1097
01:43:58,867 --> 01:44:01,036
Go up swell and drift down.

1098
01:44:01,286 --> 01:44:02,704
Broadside, captain?

1099
01:44:02,955 --> 01:44:05,332
Isn't it too dangerous?
It's too hairy.

1100
01:44:05,582 --> 01:44:08,669
I won't let two men drown!

1101
01:44:10,421 --> 01:44:14,466
Hold on, Jer. Just hold on.

1102
01:44:25,061 --> 01:44:29,023
When I say now, you go full throttle.
Got it?

1103
01:44:31,568 --> 01:44:35,071
We only get one chance at this.

1104
01:44:35,071 --> 01:44:37,532
And then?

1105
01:44:37,949 --> 01:44:40,577
We pray.

1106
01:44:56,802 --> 01:44:59,431
Wait.

1107
01:44:59,473 --> 01:45:01,974
Wait.

1108
01:45:10,441 --> 01:45:13,153
Wait.

1109
01:45:13,403 --> 01:45:15,905
Wait.

1110
01:45:25,832 --> 01:45:28,627
Now!

1111
01:45:36,718 --> 01:45:39,806
Faster!

1112
01:46:54,632 --> 01:46:57,636
We did it!

1113
01:46:57,720 --> 01:46:59,138
Guys, we're alive!

1114
01:46:59,388 --> 01:47:03,392
We made the turn! We did it!

1115
01:47:06,270 --> 01:47:08,898
Hey, skip, I'm giving you notice.

1116
01:47:09,148 --> 01:47:10,275
This is my last trip.

1117
01:47:10,525 --> 01:47:14,071
When we get back, I'm going right to
Salisbury Beach with Chris.

1118
01:47:14,321 --> 01:47:18,617
We're riding those go-carts,
full-time.

1119
01:47:20,534 --> 01:47:22,329
What do you think, skip?

1120
01:47:22,579 --> 01:47:24,623
We're doing 12 knots.

1121
01:47:24,872 --> 01:47:28,835
We keep this up,
make it through till dawn...

1122
01:47:29,086 --> 01:47:32,255
...we might get out of here.

1123
01:47:38,637 --> 01:47:40,180
They're coming around, Jeremy.

1124
01:47:40,430 --> 01:47:43,183
I can't make it, cap.
They're coming for you.

1125
01:47:43,433 --> 01:47:45,019
You're wrong, Jer!

1126
01:47:45,269 --> 01:47:47,104
They're coming for us.

1127
01:47:47,354 --> 01:47:50,608
I'm not gonna leave you here, Jer.

1128
01:47:50,858 --> 01:47:54,277
You have just one chance to
grab ahold of those nets.

1129
01:47:54,528 --> 01:47:57,948
-You roger that?
-Okay.

1130
01:48:04,497 --> 01:48:08,127
-Back full!
-Back full on!

1131
01:48:17,302 --> 01:48:21,348
You gotta swim now, Jer!

1132
01:48:30,607 --> 01:48:34,237
Grab it, Jer, just grab it!

1133
01:48:49,127 --> 01:48:51,838
Come on!

1134
01:49:00,514 --> 01:49:02,682
Climb! Climb!

1135
01:49:02,932 --> 01:49:05,477
Reach!

1136
01:49:10,608 --> 01:49:14,029
We lost one! Pick up the net!

1137
01:49:14,737 --> 01:49:19,451
Come on! Give me your hand!

1138
01:49:28,292 --> 01:49:34,508
Reach and grab it with everything
you got. Everything you've got!

1139
01:49:39,262 --> 01:49:42,099
Hold on!

1140
01:49:42,557 --> 01:49:45,643
Pull!

1141
01:49:48,271 --> 01:49:52,818
Yes! Get them inside
and clear this deck.

1142
01:49:56,321 --> 01:49:59,574
All right, let's go.

1143
01:49:59,783 --> 01:50:02,994
There's another man out there!
There's another man!

1144
01:50:03,245 --> 01:50:05,123
Jonesy!

1145
01:50:05,373 --> 01:50:09,210
Jonesy!

1146
01:51:10,440 --> 01:51:13,693
Skip, we're gonna make it.

1147
01:51:53,068 --> 01:51:56,613
She's not gonna let us out.

1148
01:52:21,764 --> 01:52:24,391
No.

1149
01:52:31,816 --> 01:52:35,737
Come on, you bitch!

1150
01:52:41,326 --> 01:52:44,872
Come on!

1151
01:52:53,839 --> 01:52:56,843
Come on!

1152
01:53:39,303 --> 01:53:42,973
Come on. We gotta get out.

1153
01:53:45,018 --> 01:53:46,644
How do we do this, skip?

1154
01:53:46,894 --> 01:53:48,521
No school for it.

1155
01:53:48,772 --> 01:53:51,440
Never was.

1156
01:54:13,463 --> 01:54:17,217
This is gonna be hard
on my little boy.

1157
01:54:32,775 --> 01:54:34,986
Bobby...

1158
01:54:35,236 --> 01:54:38,573
...I'm sorry I got you into this.

1159
01:54:39,158 --> 01:54:41,703
Skip, we made the right call.

1160
01:54:41,953 --> 01:54:44,955
We had to try.

1161
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:48,167
We were so close.

1162
01:54:52,838 --> 01:54:56,926
It was a hell of a fight, though, huh?

1163
01:55:05,309 --> 01:55:08,729
Let's get out of here, huh?

1164
01:56:18,802 --> 01:56:21,139
Christina.

1165
01:56:21,389 --> 01:56:24,892
Christina, can you hear me?

1166
01:56:24,976 --> 01:56:29,522
I don't know if you can,
but I'm talking to you, baby.

1167
01:56:29,730 --> 01:56:32,315
Do you know how much I love you?

1168
01:56:32,566 --> 01:56:35,235
I loved you the moment I saw you.

1169
01:56:35,486 --> 01:56:37,612
I love you now...

1170
01:56:37,863 --> 01:56:40,824
...and I'll love you forever.

1171
01:56:41,074 --> 01:56:43,494
No goodbye.

1172
01:56:43,745 --> 01:56:46,663
There's only love, Christina.

1173
01:56:46,914 --> 01:56:49,750
Only love.

1174
01:57:20,115 --> 01:57:22,911
It's been a week of round-the-clock
flights involving...

1175
01:57:23,161 --> 01:57:26,247
...efforts of half a dozen Northeast
air rescue stations.

1176
01:57:26,498 --> 01:57:30,418
However, as of this hour, the Coast
Guard has suspended its search...

1177
01:57:30,668 --> 01:57:34,214
...for Air National Guard
para-rescue jumper Millard Jones.

1178
01:57:34,464 --> 01:57:36,675
He leaves a wife and three daughters.

1179
01:57:36,926 --> 01:57:39,552
"The search for the" Andrea Gail
out of Gloucester...

1180
01:57:39,803 --> 01:57:42,931
...has also been suspended
after aircrafts covered...

1181
01:57:43,181 --> 01:57:46,018
... 116,000 square miles of ocean...

1182
01:57:46,267 --> 01:57:48,687
... without finding a single survivor.

1183
01:57:48,938 --> 01:57:53,150
We'll have more news
after these messages.

1184
01:58:46,748 --> 01:58:49,500
I knew Billy Tyne.

1185
01:58:49,751 --> 01:58:53,045
I did not know his crew very well.

1186
01:58:53,296 --> 01:58:58,885
But any man who sailed with him
must've been the better for it.

1187
01:58:59,093 --> 01:59:01,137
Robert Shatford...

1188
01:59:01,387 --> 01:59:03,474
...Dale Murphy...

1189
01:59:03,724 --> 01:59:05,808
...Michael Moran...

1190
01:59:06,059 --> 01:59:08,313
...David Sullivan...

1191
01:59:08,563 --> 01:59:11,649
...Alfred Pierre...

1192
01:59:11,691 --> 01:59:14,651
...may you rest easy, long-liners...

1193
01:59:14,903 --> 01:59:19,657
...in fair winds and calm seas.

1194
01:59:22,285 --> 01:59:24,203
For those of us left behind...

1195
01:59:24,453 --> 01:59:27,456
...the unmarked grave which is
home for those lost at sea...

1196
01:59:27,706 --> 01:59:30,502
...is of no consolation.

1197
01:59:30,752 --> 01:59:32,711
It can't be visited.

1198
01:59:32,961 --> 01:59:36,715
There is no headstone on which
to rest a bunch of flowers.

1199
01:59:36,965 --> 01:59:39,552
The only place we can revisit them...

1200
01:59:39,803 --> 01:59:44,431
...is in our hearts or in our dreams.

1201
01:59:45,850 --> 01:59:50,146
They say swordboatmen suffer from
a lack of dreams.

1202
01:59:50,396 --> 01:59:53,733
That's what begets their courage.

1203
01:59:54,317 --> 01:59:57,029
Well, we'll dream for you...

1204
01:59:57,279 --> 01:59:58,696
...Billy...

1205
01:59:58,947 --> 02:00:00,449
...Bobby...

1206
02:00:00,699 --> 02:00:02,033
...and Murph...

1207
02:00:02,283 --> 02:00:03,576
...Bugsy...

1208
02:00:03,827 --> 02:00:04,912
...Sully...

1209
02:00:05,162 --> 02:00:08,624
...and Alfred Pierre.

1210
02:00:09,625 --> 02:00:11,584
Sleep well.

1211
02:00:11,836 --> 02:00:14,672
Good night.

1212
02:00:39,365 --> 02:00:40,950
I'll be asleep...

1213
02:00:41,199 --> 02:00:45,204
...and then all of a sudden,
there he is.

1214
02:00:45,288 --> 02:00:46,914
That big smile.

1215
02:00:47,165 --> 02:00:50,126
You know that smile.

1216
02:00:50,375 --> 02:00:53,838
And I say,
"Hey, Bobby, where you been?"

1217
02:00:54,088 --> 02:00:56,214
But he won't tell me.

1218
02:00:56,465 --> 02:00:59,217
He just smiles and says:

1219
02:00:59,468 --> 02:01:02,680
"Remember I'll always love you,
Christina.

1220
02:01:02,930 --> 02:01:06,058
I love you now,
and I'll love you forever.

1221
02:01:06,309 --> 02:01:08,477
There's no goodbye.

1222
02:01:08,728 --> 02:01:11,439
Only love."

1223
02:01:11,689 --> 02:01:14,776
And then he's gone.

1224
02:01:16,193 --> 02:01:18,738
But he's always happy when he goes.

1225
02:01:18,989 --> 02:01:23,368
So I know he's gotta be okay.

1226
02:01:23,619 --> 02:01:27,289
Absolutely okay.

1227
02:01:33,546 --> 02:01:36,966
I love your dream.

1228
02:01:44,808 --> 02:01:46,976
The fog's just lifting.

1229
02:01:47,227 --> 02:01:50,230
You throw off your bow line,
throw off your stern.

1230
02:01:50,481 --> 02:01:52,315
You head out the South Channel...

1231
02:01:52,565 --> 02:01:55,486
...past Rocky Neck,
Ten Pound Island...

1232
02:01:55,735 --> 02:01:59,073
...past Niles Pond,
where I skated as a kid.

1233
02:01:59,323 --> 02:02:00,824
You blow your horn and wave to...

1234
02:02:01,074 --> 02:02:04,619
...the lighthouse keeper's kid
on Thatcher Island.

1235
02:02:04,869 --> 02:02:06,789
Then the birds show up.

1236
02:02:07,039 --> 02:02:09,708
Black-backs and herring gulls...

1237
02:02:09,959 --> 02:02:11,669
...big dump ducks.

1238
02:02:11,919 --> 02:02:13,295
The sun hits you.

1239
02:02:13,546 --> 02:02:15,339
You head north, open up to 12.

1240
02:02:15,589 --> 02:02:17,674
You're steaming now.

1241
02:02:17,924 --> 02:02:20,970
The guys are busy,
you're in charge.

1242
02:02:21,220 --> 02:02:24,849
You know what?
You're a goddamn swordboat captain.

1243
02:02:25,100 --> 02:02:28,645
Is there anything better in the world?
