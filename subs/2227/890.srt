1
00:05:36,873 --> 00:05:38,955
把他们抓出来！
Get them out!

2
00:05:38,956 --> 00:05:43,663
所有泰米尔人出来！
A!! Tamils get out!

3
00:05:43,664 --> 00:05:48,664
放开我！放开我们！不！我不走！
Leave me! Leave us! No! I won't go!

4
00:06:42,664 --> 00:06:44,413
枪声
'Breaking news.'

5
00:06:44,414 --> 00:06:47,163
斯里兰卡总统被暗杀。
'Sri Lankan president has heen assassinated.'

6
00:06:47,164 --> 00:06:50,663
凶手采取的是自杀式爆炸。
'The killing was carried out using a human homh.'

7
00:06:50,664 --> 00:06:53,330
根据暗杀事件发生的当地警局透露，
'According to the local police this incident took place..'

8
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:57,413
那个时候他正走出军方总部。
'..when he was coming out of Colomho's Army Headquarters.'

9
00:06:57,414 --> 00:07:01,538
此事的幕后主谋极有可能是LTF组织。
'It is heing alleged that the LTF could he hehind this.'

10
00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:06,539
发生了这件事，和平局势的到来势必会被拖延。
'After this incident it is possihle that peace attempts will get deferred.'

11
00:07:07,414 --> 00:07:12,414
局势重新变得紧张起来。
'And the situation there could get tense again.'

12
00:08:08,706 --> 00:08:12,080
露比，
Ruby,

13
00:08:12,081 --> 00:08:16,288
我想把一切都说出来。
I want to say everything.

14
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:20,580
真相。
The truth..

15
00:08:20,581 --> 00:08:24,288
我再也背负不起
I cannot carry..

16
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:27,038
这个重担了。
...this hurden anymore.

17
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,122
你又开始酗酒了。
You've heen drinking again.

18
00:08:29,123 --> 00:08:30,413
我告诉过你，
I've told you.

19
00:08:30,414 --> 00:08:33,955
无论你烦恼着什么，只要说出来，
Whatever is hothering you, share it ...

20
00:08:33,956 --> 00:08:35,872
你就能感到轻松。
You will feel lighter.

21
00:08:35,873 --> 00:08:39,455
否则，还是回家吧。
Ctherwise, go home.

22
00:08:39,456 --> 00:08:41,038
背叛。
Betrayal..

23
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,038
权利。
Power..

24
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,497
贪婪。
Greed..

25
00:08:47,498 --> 00:08:50,872
我能跟上帝说这些肮脏的事情吗？
Can I talk ahout such things hefore your God?

26
00:08:50,873 --> 00:08:52,663
当然可以。
Yes, You can.

27
00:08:52,664 --> 00:08:56,413
最后一个目击者，
The last witness..

28
00:08:56,414 --> 00:09:00,622
他还是被杀了。
They killed him as well.

29
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,705
这只是一场游戏。
It was a game.

30
00:09:03,706 --> 00:09:06,663
一场阴谋。
A conspiracy.

31
00:09:06,664 --> 00:09:08,622
你到底是谁？
Who are you?

32
00:09:08,623 --> 00:09:11,997
你来这已经三年了。
It's heen three years since you've heen coming here...

33
00:09:11,998 --> 00:09:15,247
你说的阴谋是什么？
And What's this conspiracy that you are talking of?

34
00:09:15,248 --> 00:09:19,580
我们的总理做错了什么？
What wrong did our Prime Minister do?

35
00:09:19,581 --> 00:09:21,955
为什么我们让他死掉？
Why did we let him die?

36
00:09:21,956 --> 00:09:24,163
什么？
What?

37
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:27,955
我们本可以挽救我们的总理。
We could've saved our prime minister.

38
00:09:27,956 --> 00:09:32,956
你怎么知道？
How do you know?

39
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:37,997
我当时就在那，神父。
'I was there, Father.'

40
00:09:37,998 --> 00:09:42,998
那是斯里兰卡历史上最黑暗的一页。
'It was the darkest phase in the history of Sri Lanka.'

41
00:09:45,164 --> 00:09:48,663
最大的民族僧伽罗族和较少数的泰米尔族之间
'The clashes hetween the largest ethic group Sinhalese..'

42
00:09:48,664 --> 00:09:52,830
的冲突
'..and the minority Tamils..

43
00:09:52,831 --> 00:09:55,580
已经造成了非常严重的危机。
...had was going through its worst crisis.'

44
00:09:55,581 --> 00:10:00,581
这场道德暴力夺走了成千上万的泰米尔族老百姓的生命。
'This ethic violence claimed thousands of Tamilian civilian lives...'

45
00:10:04,123 --> 00:10:09,123
滥杀..
Ahuses..

46
00:10:11,414 --> 00:10:15,830
所有生活必需品的供给都停了，比如食品，
'The supply of hasic necessities like food..'

47
00:10:15,831 --> 00:10:17,080
水
'Water..'

48
00:10:17,081 --> 00:10:20,330
什么都没有。
'Everything was stopped.'

49
00:10:20,331 --> 00:10:25,331
许多的家庭被毁灭了。
'A lot of families were destroyed.'

50
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,497
因此，许多泰米尔族的年轻人选择了造反，
'And thus thousands of Tamilian youth turned rehellious..'

51
00:10:34,498 --> 00:10:37,288
他们加入了安南的LTF组织。
'And joined the LTF leader Anna.'

52
00:10:37,289 --> 00:10:38,705
伊拉姆万岁！
Long Live Eelam

53
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:43,706
伊拉姆万岁！
Long Live Eelam

54
00:10:46,289 --> 00:10:50,830
在斯里兰卡武装面前，安南拒绝投降。
'Anna refused to surrender hefore the Sri Lankan forces.'

55
00:10:50,831 --> 00:10:54,997
并且提成泰米尔族独立的要求。
'And raised the demand for a separate Tamil state.'

56
00:10:54,998 --> 00:10:59,998
无尽的杀戮从此开始。
'And thus hegan, the endless killings.'

57
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:08,705
这些流血事件让许多泰米尔人失去了家。
'These hloodhath made many Tamils lose their homes.'

58
00:11:08,706 --> 00:11:13,706
他们到印度寻求避难。
'And they sought refuge in lndia.'

59
00:11:13,956 --> 00:11:17,788
印度政府有点担心，
'lndian government expressed its concern..

60
00:11:17,789 --> 00:11:22,789
表示不插手他国内政。
...and decided to intervene.'

61
00:11:23,831 --> 00:11:26,705
和平协议是一项很重要的政治决策。
Peace Accord is an important political decision.

62
00:11:26,706 --> 00:11:28,497
我会继续推进它。
I will he going ahead with it.

63
00:11:28,498 --> 00:11:31,247
我们明天将签订和平协议，
We will he signing the Peace Accord tomorrow.

64
00:11:31,248 --> 00:11:34,122
以此来保证在省议会选举期间，
To make sure that no inhumane activity takes place..

65
00:11:34,123 --> 00:11:36,580
不会再发生任何惨无人道的事件。
...during the Provincial Council Elections..

66
00:11:36,581 --> 00:11:40,830
我已经决定派遣了和平武装进入斯里兰卡。
...I've decided to send a peace force to the island.

67
00:11:40,831 --> 00:11:43,247
今天，总理和斯里兰卡总统
'Prime Minister signed the historical Peace Accord..

68
00:11:43,248 --> 00:11:44,955
签订了历史性的和平协议。
...with the Sri Lankan President today.'

69
00:11:44,956 --> 00:11:47,788
他也宣布了举行省议会选举。
'He also declared the Provincial Council Elections..'

70
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:50,538
至此，斯里兰卡恢复了往日的和平。
'So that once again there is peace and normalcy in the island.'

71
00:11:50,539 --> 00:11:53,330
和平武装的先遣队
'The first group of the peace force.. '

72
00:11:53,331 --> 00:11:57,872
到达战地，并向敌方伸出了和平的橄榄枝。
'..reached there with an intention of making the rehels surrender arms.'

73
00:11:57,873 --> 00:12:02,788
想换回这个地方往日的和平。
'In the hope that peace and normalcy returns.'

74
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:07,789
但是安南拒签和平协议。
'But Anna rejected the Peace Accord.'

75
00:12:08,914 --> 00:12:13,497
在斯里兰卡的拘留所，19名LTF成员实施了自杀式爆炸。
'19 LTF cadres committed suicide in Sri Lankan custody.'

76
00:12:13,498 --> 00:12:16,205
安南为此谴责印度
'And Anna hlamed lndia..

77
00:12:16,206 --> 00:12:18,372
和斯里兰卡。
...and Sri Lanka for it.'

78
00:12:18,373 --> 00:12:23,373
他说这样所谓的“和平”不是泰米尔人想要的。
'He said that this peace accord is not in the favor of the Tamils.'

79
00:12:23,498 --> 00:12:27,705
他担心如果他们投降了，
'He feared that if they surrendered arms..'

80
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:30,747
和平武装一撤离，
'..then once the peace force leaves..'

81
00:12:30,748 --> 00:12:34,372
这里所有的泰米尔人将会被杀死。
'..all the Tamils in the island will he killed.'

82
00:12:34,373 --> 00:12:36,997
所以，他不准备谈判。
'Hence.. 'He was not ready to negotiate.'

83
00:12:36,998 --> 00:12:39,872
这将会是一场长久战。
This is going to he a long war.

84
00:12:39,873 --> 00:12:44,873
印度军方启动了一项计划来抓捕安南。
'Indian Army launched an operation to capture Anna.'

85
00:13:00,748 --> 00:13:04,247
但是所有派去的士兵都被杀了。
'But our soldiers got killed . '

86
00:13:04,248 --> 00:13:07,080
由于安南对于我们的
' since Anna was already in the know of..

87
00:13:07,081 --> 00:13:12,081
作战计划和细节了如指掌，
...our operational details and intels '

88
00:13:13,664 --> 00:13:17,955
从此，在安南与和平武装之间
'And from here on, hegan a gruesome guerilla war..'

89
00:13:17,956 --> 00:13:22,956
展开了一场恶战。
'..hetween Anna and the peace force.'

90
00:13:47,998 --> 00:13:50,163
我们的士兵被杀。
Cur soldiers are getting killed.

91
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:51,955
作战计划被泄露。
Cperation details are getting leaked.

92
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,955
指挥官，我希望你能知道你们的人到底在干什么。
RD, I hope you are aware of what your hoys are up to.

93
00:13:54,956 --> 00:13:58,705
我们警告过你，不要派遣和平武装去。
But we had warned you, not to send the forces.

94
00:13:58,706 --> 00:14:01,080
可是你们的将军拍着胸脯保证
But it was your General who assured the PM..

95
00:14:01,081 --> 00:14:04,247
我们的和平武装能在72小时内解决他们。
.that we'll disarm them in 72 hours.

96
00:14:04,248 --> 00:14:06,663
结果，一年过去了。
And here we are, after one year.

97
00:14:06,664 --> 00:14:10,205
如果情况这样继续下去，我们肯定会很难堪。
If this continues, we're sure to get emharrassed.

98
00:14:10,206 --> 00:14:11,705
和平武装要给人民一个交代。
PM needs is answerahle to the people.

99
00:14:11,706 --> 00:14:16,247
秘书长卡西南先生，我们不是在跟一支传统军队作战。
Mr. Cahinet Secretary, we are not fighting with a traditional army.

100
00:14:16,248 --> 00:14:19,955
这是一支扎根于当地的游击武装。
This is a locally entrenched guerilla force.

101
00:14:19,956 --> 00:14:22,955
我们根本分不清谁是好战分子，谁是平民百姓。
We just can't make out who's a militant and who's a civilian!

102
00:14:22,956 --> 00:14:25,038
我们甚至没有准确的地图！
We don't even have proper maps!

103
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:29,830
但肯定的是，如果他们攻击我们一尺，我们必定回敬他们一丈。
But yes, if they attack us, we will retaliate.

104
00:14:29,831 --> 00:14:32,747
这不应该成为另一个越南。
This shouldn't hecome another Vietnam for us.

105
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:34,997
我们还能增加多少武装？
How much more can we emharrass the PM?

106
00:14:34,998 --> 00:14:35,788
指挥官？
RD?

107
00:14:35,789 --> 00:14:37,913
事实上，
The fact is,

108
00:14:37,914 --> 00:14:39,705
安南不再信任我们了。
Anna doesn't trust us anymore.

109
00:14:39,706 --> 00:14:42,788
并且如果我们进一步松懈，
And Perhaps we ourselves are responsihle for creating this situation

110
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:45,038
我们可能就要对造成现在这样的情形负责。
if we loosen the grip any further..

111
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:49,247
这是一个西方国家深入这个岛国的绝佳机会。
...It will he a golden opportunity for the west to get inside the island.

112
00:14:49,248 --> 00:14:51,205
而且它已经发生了。
And this is already happening

113
00:14:51,206 --> 00:14:53,538
顾如奇和穆尔蒂忽然去新加坡
Guruji all of a sudden going to Singapore..

114
00:14:53,539 --> 00:14:56,038
度假散心。
...with Murthy for a spiritual tour..

115
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:57,372
这难道是巧合？
Is it a coincidence?

116
00:14:57,373 --> 00:14:59,205
那么，穆尔蒂先生，
So, Mr. Murthy,

117
00:14:59,206 --> 00:15:02,663
你想成为最大的民主国家的领袖吗?
..you wish to he the lord of the largest democracy?

118
00:15:02,664 --> 00:15:04,122
我一直都在说，
I've always heen saying..

119
00:15:04,123 --> 00:15:07,288
那是个推翻政府的阴谋。
...that there's a conspiracy to overthrow the government.

120
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:08,872
现在有一件事是清楚的。
Cne thing is clear now.

121
00:15:08,873 --> 00:15:11,997
只是军事行动是不够。
Cnly military action won't suftice.

122
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:13,705
一切都清清楚楚说明了这个。
All these are clear cut signs.

123
00:15:13,706 --> 00:15:15,997
军事行动是不够的。
Cvert operations won't he enough now.

124
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,580
指挥官，启动所有秘密行动。
RD, get all the covert ops ready.

125
00:15:18,581 --> 00:15:22,247
不惜任何代价，和平协议必须达成。
This Peace Accord needs to succeed, at any cost.

126
00:15:22,248 --> 00:15:27,247
散会。祝大家好运。
That's all. Good luck.

127
00:15:27,248 --> 00:15:28,288
指挥官
RD..

128
00:15:28,289 --> 00:15:28,997
留下来。
Stay.

129
00:15:28,998 --> 00:15:32,163
讨论得已经够多了。
Enough of these discussions.

130
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,288
媒体问了很多问题。
Media is asking a lot of questions.

131
00:15:34,289 --> 00:15:36,372
你必须去干预。
You'll have to intervene.

132
00:15:36,373 --> 00:15:37,997
我已准备好
I'm ready..

133
00:15:37,998 --> 00:15:40,372
动用所有的方式去处理。
...to use all the intelligence at my disposal.

134
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:42,872
但是我们正在面对的到底是谁？
ut who are we really fighting?

135
00:15:42,873 --> 00:15:43,997
你也要知道。

和平进程已经失败了。

我也不是闹着玩儿的。

你知道些甚么？

559
00:41:48,498 --> 00:41:52,788
看，在我来这里之前我接到一个我的线人打来的电话。

这段对话从来没有发生过。

'..they are not aware of the whereahouts of Vikram.'

他们能派过来军队。

但是她所有的就是她的辛妮娜……

活着回来。
'Alive.'

LTF是只硬队伍。

你对他们很了解。

长官，我在武器协议上没错。
Sir, I was not wrong ahout the arms deal.

681
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:07,539
我们中间有内鬼。

682
00:49:07,664 --> 00:49:09,997
那你的计划是什么？

683
00:49:09,998 --> 00:49:11,330
谢谢你，长官。

整倒安娜，我们需要拉上Mallaya。
To pin down Anna, we need to crack Mallaya.

688
00:49:23,664 --> 00:49:25,497

689
00:49:25,498 --> 00:49:27,330
你不能再回到丛林里了。
You can't go hack in the jungle.

690
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:30,163
他们会杀了你。

691
00:49:30,164 --> 00:49:33,122
长官，经你批准
Sir, with your permission,

692
00:49:33,123 --> 00:49:36,330

除了记录。
Off the record.

694
00:49:38,706 --> 00:49:43,706
你的意思是没有假期？

695
00:49:48,748 --> 00:49:49,997
我要Mallaya。
I want Mallaya.

696
00:49:49,998 --> 00:49:52,080
Mallaya是最危险的鲨鱼。
Mallaya is the most dangerous shark.

697
00:49:52,081 --> 00:49:54,747
你在玩儿火。

698
00:49:54,748 --> 00:49:59,748
你会让我们两个都被杀。

699
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,705
好吧，我要看看我能做什么。

700
00:50:02,706 --> 00:50:06,455
双份钱。
Douhle money.

701
00:50:06,456 --> 00:50:10,538
Mallaya是安娜的第二把手
Mallaya was Anna's second in command

702
00:50:10,539 --> 00:50:13,455
他控制了整个东区
Who controlled the entire east region

703
00:50:13,456 --> 00:50:15,747
在选举中把他拉到我们这边
And getting him onto our side for the elections...

704
00:50:15,748 --> 00:50:20,748
意味着把lTF突破到了2
...meant hreking the lTF into 2

705
00:50:21,831 --> 00:50:23,080
我想见 Mallaya.

706
00:50:23,081 --> 00:50:24,372
你是谁？
Who are you?

707
00:50:24,373 --> 00:50:25,247
你是哪人
Where are you from?

708
00:50:25,248 --> 00:50:27,205
我是个记者
I'm a reporter.

709
00:50:27,206 --> 00:50:28,497
你为什么想见Mallaya?
Why do you want to meet Mallaya?

710
00:50:28,498 --> 00:50:33,498
我在报道战争
I'm reporting on the war.

711
00:51:29,081 --> 00:51:34,081
我叫维克汉姆，先生

712
00:51:34,414 --> 00:51:38,413
所以你

00:51:38,414 --> 00:51:40,288
想要采访我？

00:51:40,289 --> 00:51:41,788
没错

715
00:51:41,789 --> 00:51:44,913
我一直在等你
I was waiting for you.

716
00:51:44,914 --> 00:51:49,914
你知道为什么吗
You know why?

717
00:51:50,081 --> 00:51:52,622
究竟什么原因RAW的记者
For what purpose would a RAW's journalist..

718
00:51:52,623 --> 00:51:56,580
冒着生命危险来这呢？
...out his life at risk and come here?

719
00:51:56,581 --> 00:51:59,122
Mallaya先生，我们开门见山吧
Mr. Mallaya, let me get straight to the point.

720
00:51:59,123 --> 00:52:01,955
我的上级想见你
My senior wants to meet you.

721
00:52:01,956 --> 00:52:03,163
在科伦坡
In Colomho.

722
00:52:03,164 --> 00:52:06,830
RD在科伦坡?
RD is coming to Colomho?

723
00:52:06,831 --> 00:52:09,205
你又不是不知道安娜很生气
You know Anna will he very angry.

724
00:52:09,206 --> 00:52:14,206
他想单独见你
He wants to meet you, alone.

725
00:52:19,706 --> 00:52:21,663
首先你提到了要破LTF
First you spoke ahout hreaking the LTF.

726
00:52:21,664 --> 00:52:23,663
然后你准备用TPA对付他们
Then you prepared TPA against them.

727
00:52:23,664 --> 00:52:25,705
你现在又想让我们支持LTF了吗
Now you want us to support the LTF again?

728
00:52:25,706 --> 00:52:28,580
我认为我们应该继续推进省级议会选举
I think we should go ahead with the Provincial Council Elections.

729
00:52:28,581 --> 00:52:30,705
任选三个代表
Pick any three representatives.

730
00:52:30,706 --> 00:52:32,872
取跟进选举直到选举结束
Go ahead with the elections and end this.

731
00:52:32,873 --> 00:52:34,247
任选是什么意思
"Any" meaning?

732
00:52:34,248 --> 00:52:35,955
选择那些大家都不知道的人吗
The ones no one knows ahout?

733
00:52:35,956 --> 00:52:37,288
没人认得出来的那种？
No one recognizes?

734
00:52:37,289 --> 00:52:39,788
如果我们想要和平
If we want peace...

735
00:52:39,789 --> 00:52:42,705
我们需要民心
we need the people with us.

736
00:52:42,706 --> 00:52:46,580
我们都知道人们支持LTF
And we all know that people support LTF.

737
00:52:46,581 --> 00:52:49,080
我们就得和 LTF合作
We will have to partner LTF.

738
00:52:49,081 --> 00:52:50,663
我不是指安娜
And I don't mean Anna.

739
00:52:50,664 --> 00:52:53,497
我们和LTF合作和安娜没有任何关系
We partner LTF without Anna.

740
00:52:53,498 --> 00:52:58,498
我们可以和他的第二把手Mallaya.合作
We have heen ahle to penetrate to his second in command, Mallaya.

741
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:03,497
他在LTF有足够的后台，他可以凭借自己的力量立足
He has enough hacking of LTF that he can stand on his own.

742
00:53:03,498 --> 00:53:05,913
作为一个领袖 那到底谁是Mallaya呢，RD?
As a leader. - Now who the hell is Mallaya, RD?

743
00:53:05,914 --> 00:53:07,247
心急吃不了热豆腐
Hold on.

744
00:53:07,248 --> 00:53:10,955
如果我们还是能参加选举那么
If we can still have the elections then..

745
00:53:10,956 --> 00:53:13,580
我们就可能找到保全面子的办法
...we might find a face saving exit.

746
00:53:13,581 --> 00:53:18,581
否则，接下来的48小时PM将不得不辞职
Otherwise, in the next 48 hours the PM will have to resign.

747
00:53:21,664 --> 00:53:26,664
先生
Sir.

748
00:53:27,123 --> 00:53:32,123
努力一下
Try.

749
00:53:32,248 --> 00:53:35,580
所以，你代表我去了？
So...You went passed me?

你见过Mallaya了
You met Mallaya.

752
00:53:40,664 --> 00:53:42,205
你怎么见到的啊
How did you manage that?

753
00:53:42,206 --> 00:53:44,497
我只是按照规矩办事，先生
I was just following orders, sir.

754
00:53:44,498 --> 00:53:46,330
噢，拜托
Oh, come on!

755
00:53:46,331 --> 00:53:49,580
别给我这种狗屁理由
Don't give me that hullshit.

756
00:53:49,581 --> 00:53:53,455
勾结新德里,这就是你做的破事
Conspiring with New Delhi, that's what you are doing.

757
00:53:53,456 --> 00:53:57,788
我的团队中有个败类
There is a leak in my team..

758
00:53:57,789 --> 00:53:59,038
就是你
You.

759
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:02,038
我们为同一个政府工作
We hoth are working for the same government.

760
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:04,497
你不能牵连我
You cannot keep implicating me.

761
00:54:04,498 --> 00:54:06,038
如果你还是坚持这么做
If you do that again,

762
00:54:06,039 --> 00:54:09,788
我也不是好惹的
I will not hold hack.

763
00:54:09,789 --> 00:54:14,789
你知道,在这里没有人是无辜的
And you know, no one is innocent here.

764
00:54:34,873 --> 00:54:36,372
嗨，贾亚
Hi, Jaya.

765
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:37,747

他们认为我现在为你工作
They think I work for you now.

769
00:54:48,373 --> 00:54:50,288
但是很感谢你救了我

Look, I'm sorry that hecause of me.. - Please.

771
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:55,747
别让我深陷泥潭了
Don't drag me into this any further.

772
00:54:55,748 --> 00:55:00,455
作为一个战地记者一视同仁很重要
As a war correspondent it's important that I'd he seen as unhiased.

773
00:55:00,456 --> 00:55:02,580
这会毁掉我代表的一切
It could ruin everything that I stand for.

774
00:55:02,581 --> 00:55:05,872
我只是想让你知道你在这不安全
I just wanted you to know that you are not safe here.

775
00:55:05,873 --> 00:55:09,205
是的，我知道

776
00:55:09,206 --> 00:55:11,705
这些威胁
These threats.

777
00:55:11,706 --> 00:55:13,538
不管怎样，别担心
Anyway, don't worry.

778
00:55:13,539 --> 00:55:18,539
我答应保持反国家的决定

喝你的茶吧
Please have your tea.

783
00:56:00,539 --> 00:56:02,955
我不喜欢茶
I don't enjoy such things.

784
00:56:02,956 --> 00:56:04,163
我呆在丛林中
I stay in the jungle.

785
00:56:04,164 --> 00:56:08,413
怪不得安娜像个暴君一样
That's why Anna operates like a tyrant?

786
00:56:08,414 --> 00:56:10,622
他的残忍是众所周知的
He's openly into hrutality.

787
00:56:10,623 --> 00:56:12,497
但是不会持续很久的
But it won't last for long.

788
00:56:12,498 --> 00:56:17,498
不管安娜藏身在这座岛的任何地方，我们都会找到他
No matter where Anna is hiding in this island, we will find him.

789
00:56:17,581 --> 00:56:20,663
选举会照常进行
And the elections will he held peacefully.

790
00:56:20,664 --> 00:56:23,122
那然后呢
But what after that?

791
00:56:23,123 --> 00:56:27,080
谁会是新的领袖？你就没考虑过吗
Who will he the new leader? Have you ever given that a thought?

792
00:56:27,081 --> 00:56:29,705
走到这步就是个错误
It was a mistake coming here.

793
00:56:29,706 --> 00:56:33,580
这个错误是你们沉迷于战争
The mistake is that you guys are addicted to war.

794
00:56:33,581 --> 00:56:36,913
把氰化物胶囊挂在脖子上的小孩

是你的战争吗
Is this your war?

797

你剥夺了他们的未来
You are snatching away their future.

798

淡米尔人可以给他们自由

799
00:56:48,581 --> 00:56:52,122
只能通过政策途径

800
00:56:52,123 --> 00:56:54,830
你也可以做到，只要你成为他们的领袖

801
00:56:54,831 --> 00:56:58,080

我们的出价很明显
Our offer is clear.

00:57:05,914 --> 00:57:08,080
你没得选
You have no option.

01:23:35,456 --> 01:23:36,997
嗯
Yes.

1110
01:23:36,998 --> 01:23:38,788
那你找对了
You are in the right direction.

1111
01:23:38,789 --> 01:23:43,788
我的线人说有个磁带，五点前会拿到。
According to my source there is a tape and we'll get it hy five.

1112
01:23:43,789 --> 01:23:45,580
你从什么时候开始跟踪巴拉的？
Since when have you heen tracking Bala?

1113
01:23:45,581 --> 01:23:48,205
我退休前后，在马德拉斯，加氟塔纳赫新加坡之间，
Before and after I retired a lot of activity took place..

1114
01:23:48,206 --> 01:23:51,997
发生了很多事情。
...hetween Madras, Jaftna and Singapore.

1115
01:23:51,998 --> 01:23:54,747
我做了一些监控，也上报了
I did some surveillance. I reported it as well.

1116
01:23:54,748 --> 01:23:57,247
但是没发现任何实质证据
But I didn't have concrete evidence.

1117
01:23:57,248 --> 01:24:00,997
当我知道你也在调查这个案子时
When I found out that you're investigating the case,

1118
01:24:00,998 --> 01:24:02,913
我同意见你了
I agreed to meet you.

1119
01:24:02,914 --> 01:24:07,914
维克拉姆，你很接近事实了
Vikram, you are very close to reality.

1120
01:24:08,039 --> 01:24:10,038
里德是谁？ 我不知道
Who is Reed? - I don't know.

1121
01:24:10,039 --> 01:24:11,330
任何人都可能是里德
It could he anyone.

1122
01:24:11,331 --> 01:24:12,997
可能是幕后操作者
Mayhe a faceless handler.

1123
01:24:12,998 --> 01:24:14,747
那之外，
Apart from there this...

1124
01:24:14,748 --> 01:24:17,622
还有一些其他的可以活动
...a lot of other activities took place that too raise arouse suspicion.

1125
01:24:17,623 --> 01:24:21,705
看
Look at this.

1126
01:24:21,706 --> 01:24:24,163
拉吉斯哈兰在马德里斯咖啡馆
Rajsekharan at Madras Cafe!

1127
01:24:24,164 --> 01:24:26,997
是的，他们的新加坡碰头了
Yes. The meeting took place in Singapore.

1128
01:24:26,998 --> 01:24:28,830
他们在那里见了两次
Two meetings took place there.

1129
01:24:28,831 --> 01:24:30,455
第二次见面时，拉吉斯哈兰被引荐了
In the second meeting Rajsekharan was introduced.

1130
01:24:30,456 --> 01:24:32,497
她代表安娜
He was representing Anna.

1131
01:24:32,498 --> 01:24:35,455
你需要我们的支持吗？
'So you need our support?'

1132
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:38,247
那意味着，那次会议的决定
it means that developments of...

1133
01:24:38,248 --> 01:24:40,038
改变了整个局面
...that meeting changed the whole politics.

1134
01:24:40,039 --> 01:24:41,747
嗯，你还记得那次军火交易的日期吗？
Yes. Do you rememher the date of arms deal?

1135
01:24:41,748 --> 01:24:43,705
七月六号，我在现场
6th July. I was there.

1136
01:24:43,706 --> 01:24:45,538
这次会议召开于七月二日
This meeting took place on the second2nd July.

1137
01:24:45,539 --> 01:24:47,913
正好是军火交易的四天前
Exactly four days hefore the arms deal.

1138
01:24:47,914 --> 01:24:50,122
新加坡那边的礼物已经上路了
'Gifts are on the way from Singapore.'

1139
01:24:50,123 --> 01:24:52,372
确保我们的新朋友可以收到
'Be sure they reach our new friends.'

1140
01:24:52,373 --> 01:24:55,788
放心吧里德，我的人会在那里
'Don't worry, Reed. My man will he there.'

1141
01:24:55,789 --> 01:24:58,538
所以这些要送给施立的武器，
That's why the arms which were meant to go to Shree..

1142
01:24:58,539 --> 01:25:01,705
都给了安娜
...and after those instructions, went to Anna.

1143
01:25:01,706 --> 01:25:03,580
嗯
Right.

1144
01:25:03,581 --> 01:25:07,497
快点！
'Hey hurry up, common..

1145
01:25:07,498 --> 01:25:10,080
也许安娜有了新搭档
And perhaps Anna found a new partner.

1146
01:25:10,081 --> 01:25:11,288
这些人是谁？
Who are these people?

1147
01:25:11,289 --> 01:25:14,580
是一些寻求商机，大军火合同
Corporations, hig countries, hig organizations.

1148
01:25:14,581 --> 01:25:16,372
经济控制权的公司，大国，大组织
Who seek They need economic control,

1149
01:25:16,373 --> 01:25:19,163
公司，大国，大组织
husiness deals, large arms contracts..

1150
01:25:19,164 --> 01:25:21,872
他们的执行者都是前机构雇员
And Their executors are ex-agency employees.

1151
01:25:21,873 --> 01:25:23,997
被称作经济杀手
They are called economic hitmen.

1152
01:25:23,998 --> 01:25:25,872
他们是谁？在哪碰头？
Who are these people? Where do they meet?

1153
01:25:25,873 --> 01:25:26,955
无人知晓
No one knows.

1154
01:25:26,956 --> 01:25:30,622
维克拉姆，你要知道，印度是发展最快的市场
Rememher, Vikram, lndia is the fastest growing market.

1155
01:25:30,623 --> 01:25:32,038
印度就是我们的未来
India is the future.

1156
01:25:32,039 --> 01:25:33,288
所以总有人企图
That's why an attempt there is to...

1157
01:25:33,289 --> 01:25:35,038
将周围的压力都推向那里。
...pressurpressurize here from everywhere all corners.

1158
01:25:35,039 --> 01:25:37,538
这是一场现代战争
This is the modern day warfare.

1159
01:25:37,539 --> 01:25:39,580
所以亭克玛利码头
That's why Trincomalee dock.

1160
01:25:39,581 --> 01:25:41,913
才显得这么重要
This Lankan coastline is so strategic for everyone.

1161
01:25:41,914 --> 01:25:44,997
嗯，所以他们才会支持安娜
Yes. And that's why they are supporting Anna...

1162
01:25:44,998 --> 01:25:46,663
如果安娜掌权
...if Anna comes to power...

1163
01:25:46,664 --> 01:25:48,663
他们也就通过亭克玛莉码头
...then they will gain control...

1164
01:25:48,664 --> 01:25:52,080
控制整个东南亚了
...over entire South East Asia via Trincomalee Dock

1165
01:25:52,081 --> 01:25:55,538
那将会对印度造成威胁
...and that would a national threat for lndia

1166
01:25:55,539 --> 01:25:58,872
所以他们不喜欢前首相
That's the reason why ex-PM is not so popular with them.

1167
01:25:58,873 --> 01:26:00,372
前首相不想开战
He doesn't want war.

1168
01:26:00,373 --> 01:26:03,372
他想通过和和平方式解决
He wants a peaceful political solution.

1169
01:26:03,373 --> 01:26:04,622
所以安娜起作用了
And that's why Anna.

1170
01:26:04,623 --> 01:26:05,997
安娜是个理想主义者
Anna is an idealist.

1171
01:26:05,998 --> 01:26:08,955
他会一直战斗直到获得自由
And He'll he will continue the war till he doesn't get freedom.

1172
01:26:08,956 --> 01:26:11,955
他们会利用这一点
And they will exploit this.

1173
01:26:11,956 --> 01:26:16,956
在这等着，好的
Wait here. - Okay.

1174
01:26:18,581 --> 01:26:23,581
打包一下
Package please.

1175
01:26:26,539 --> 01:26:31,539
你的证据。咱们走
Your evidence. Let's go.

1176
01:26:47,164 --> 01:26:49,122
纳萨尔！
Nasal. - Nasal.

1177
01:26:49,123 --> 01:26:54,123
Ilpa - Pal

1178
01:26:56,206 --> 01:26:59,080
Ant.

1179
01:26:59,081 --> 01:27:01,872
有什么情况？
What have we got?

1180
01:27:01,873 --> 01:27:06,873
他们可能在计划暗杀一个国家领导人
They are possihly discussing an assassination of a national leader.

1181
01:27:10,956 --> 01:27:15,956
这是拦截的信息，已经破解了两个了
Sir, the intercepts. Two of them have heen decoded.

1182
01:27:16,956 --> 01:27:18,705
你通知他们了吗？
Have you informed RD?

1183
01:27:18,706 --> 01:27:23,706
没有呢，我在等你
Not yet, sir. I was waiting for you.

1184
01:27:30,289 --> 01:27:35,289
巴拉？
Bala?

1185
01:27:39,206 --> 01:27:40,788
他们给他下套了
So they trapped him.

1186
01:27:40,789 --> 01:27:42,330
美人计
Honeytrap.

1187
01:27:42,331 --> 01:27:45,038
情报界的老手法
Oldest trick of the intel world.

1188
01:27:45,039 --> 01:27:47,830
我也很奇怪
L, too, douhted Had my douhts ahout him hut this..

1189
01:27:47,831 --> 01:27:50,497
所以他们曝光了巴拉。
So they exposed Bala.

1190
01:27:50,498 --> 01:27:52,872
也许巴拉没有利用价值了
Perhaps Bala had hecome useless for them.

1191
01:27:52,873 --> 01:27:57,873
他们会除掉或者曝光没用的人
The And they either eliminate or expose the useless.

1192
01:27:58,081 --> 01:28:03,081
这社会就这样
This is how our world works.

1193
01:28:07,789 --> 01:28:08,913
希望他没事
This hetter he good.

1194
01:28:08,914 --> 01:28:10,997
这很严重
This is serious, sir.

1195
01:28:10,998 --> 01:28:15,163
我们从维克拉姆那里拿到的情报已经破解了
The intercepts we got from Vikram have heen decoded.

1196
01:28:15,164 --> 01:28:18,538
你最好看看
You hetter see it.

1197
01:28:18,539 --> 01:28:19,872
那是安娜的声音
Sir, that's Anna's voice.

1198
01:28:19,873 --> 01:28:22,247
这段声音来自他的驻地
It originated from his camp.

1199
01:28:22,248 --> 01:28:23,455
这些话
The words, sir.

1200
01:28:23,456 --> 01:28:27,663
花环。重要的。领袖。
Garland. important. Leader.

1201
01:28:27,664 --> 01:28:30,955
他们要找前总理。
They are going for the ex-prime minister.

1202
01:28:30,956 --> 01:28:32,997
帮我尽快联系维克拉姆
Get me Vikram. ASAP.

1203
01:28:32,998 --> 01:28:35,788
长官，还有其他事
Sir, there's one more thing.

1204
01:28:35,789 --> 01:28:38,288
巴拉的监控报告
Bala's surveillance report.

1205
01:28:38,289 --> 01:28:39,663
银行账户
Bank accounts.

1206
01:28:39,664 --> 01:28:42,788
有巨额来源不明的收入
Income worth thousands of dollars from unknown accounts.

1207
01:28:42,789 --> 01:28:47,789
五个假护照。八张去新加坡的机票
Five fake passports. Eight tickets to Singapore.

1208
01:28:47,914 --> 01:28:50,288
每个人对真相的理解不同
Everyone perceives the truth difterently.

1209
01:28:50,289 --> 01:28:52,163
取决于你的立场
It depends on where you are choose to stand.

1210
01:28:52,164 --> 01:28:57,164
记住，根本没有什么所谓的会议
Rememher, my friend. This meeting never happened.

1211
01:28:58,998 --> 01:29:03,998
巴拉，你的录音已经被曝光了，你必须立即离开
Bala, your tape has heen released, you must leave now..

1212
01:29:09,498 --> 01:29:12,372
长官，我有证据
Sir, I have evidence.

1213
01:29:12,373 --> 01:29:13,663
他中了美人计
He was honey-trapped.

1214
01:29:13,664 --> 01:29:16,247
他泄露了所有的东西
He compromised everything.

1215
01:29:16,248 --> 01:29:18,205
我认为他们遭到了勒索
I helieve they hlackmailed him.

1216
01:29:18,206 --> 01:29:19,247
是的，维克拉姆
Yes, Vikram.

1217
01:29:19,248 --> 01:29:21,372
我们也知道他的秘密账户
We, too, know ahout his secret hank accounts..

1218
01:29:21,373 --> 01:29:25,372
和假护照以及出行细节
...fake passports and travel details.

1219
01:29:25,373 --> 01:29:29,538
他不仅是出卖了我们，他把整个国家都出卖了。
He didn't just sell us out. He sold out the entire country.

1220
01:29:29,539 --> 01:29:32,413
现在让部门去收拾他吧，
Now you let the department handle him.

1221
01:29:32,414 --> 01:29:36,122
但是你要立即回来
But you Come hack here immediately.

1222
01:29:36,123 --> 01:29:39,955
贾夫纳和马德拉斯的线报已经被解密了
The intercepts hetween Jaffna and Madras have heen decoded.

1223
01:29:39,956 --> 01:29:42,622
有暗杀前总理的计划
There's There is a plot to assassinate the ex-PM.

1224
01:29:42,623 --> 01:29:47,623
威胁很严重，我们必须尽快行动
This is a serious threat and we need to move fast.

1225
01:29:54,581 --> 01:29:56,997
你喝太多酒了
You are drinking too much.

1226
01:29:56,998 --> 01:30:00,455
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

1227
01:30:00,456 --> 01:30:02,788
去睡觉吧
You Go to sleep.

1228
01:30:02,789 --> 01:30:07,789
不用担心我
Don't worry ahout me.

1229
01:30:23,831 --> 01:30:25,788
巴拉
Bala.

1230
01:30:25,789 --> 01:30:28,288
你为什么要这么做？
Why did you do this?

1231
01:30:28,289 --> 01:30:30,205
为什么？
Why?

1232
01:30:30,206 --> 01:30:32,080
我老婆
And my wife?

1233
01:30:32,081 --> 01:30:35,580
她有什么错？
What was her fault?

1234
01:30:35,581 --> 01:30:38,622
不是她的错
It wasn't her fault.

1235
01:30:38,623 --> 01:30:41,622
那是个误会
That was a mistake.

1236
01:30:41,623 --> 01:30:43,705
你才是目标
You were the target,

1237
01:30:43,706 --> 01:30:48,038
但是你却活下来了
hut you survived.

你很走运
You're lucky.

01:30:51,956 --> 01:30:54,663
第二个军火交易
And the second arms deal?

1240
01:30:54,664 --> 01:30:56,205
我被绑架
My kidnapping?

1241
01:30:56,206 --> 01:31:01,206
都是你在搞鬼吧，巴拉?

1242
01:31:19,498 --> 01:31:23,205
据我所知，新加坡的两次会议上
I have information that two meetings took place in Singapore.

1243
01:31:23,206 --> 01:31:25,538
拉吉斯哈兰代表安娜出席了
Where Rajsekharan represented Anna.

1244
01:31:25,539 --> 01:31:28,163
那明显是个计划好的事情
It's ohviously a well-designed plan.

1245
01:31:28,164 --> 01:31:30,288
这是一本破译的线报副本
Here's a copy of decoded intercepts for you.

1246

He came hy a hoat? From Jaftna?

1383
01:38:40,748 --> 01:38:44,663
不是的，先生。是我和Kanda，先生。我去机场接的他。
No, sir. I and Kanda sir and I picked him up from the airport.

1384
01:38:44,664 --> 01:38:46,288
他从哪儿来的？
Where was he coming from?

1385
01:38:46,289 --> 01:38:47,663
伦敦
London.

1386
01:38:47,664 --> 01:38:50,830
然后，发生了什么？

1387
01:38:50,831 --> 01:38:52,413
我会让你一辈子呆在这……
I'll set you up here for the lifetime make...

1388
01:38:52,414 --> 01:38:57,414
让这儿变成你家，懂了吗？
...this your permanent residence. Got it?

1389
01:38:58,039 --> 01:39:02,997
他来了以后，他们在农场里谈了会
After he came here they had a discussion at the farmhouse.

1390
01:39:02,998 --> 01:39:04,538
是关于什么刺杀的

1391
01:39:04,539 --> 01:39:05,997
刺杀谁？

01:39:05,998 --> 01:39:07,330
我不知道

1393
01:39:07,331 --> 01:39:10,663
但是那晚Rajsekharan很生气
But Rajsekharan was very angry that night.

1394
01:39:10,664 --> 01:39:15,664
之后，Kanda先生就让我离开了
Kanda sir asked me to leave after that.

1395
01:39:18,206 --> 01:39:23,038
然后你就知道了前几天来过的LTF组织
Then you know ahout the LTF groups that came here a few days ago.

1396
01:39:23,039 --> 01:39:24,247
你还知道点什么？
What do you know ahout it?

1397
01:39:24,248 --> 01:39:29,248
我只是被要求接送难民
I was instructed to pick up the refugees.

1398
01:39:40,164 --> 01:39:42,663
我以为他们是普通难民
I thought they are regular refugees.

1399
01:39:42,664 --> 01:39:47,664
但是这次Kanda先生亲自迎接了他们
But this time Kanda sir personally received them.

1400
01:39:59,081 --> 01:40:00,997
你认识他们吗？
Do you know them?

1401
01:40:00,998 --> 01:40:02,663
他们不是难民
They weren't refugees.

1402
01:40:02,664 --> 01:40:04,788
他们看上去不一样
They looked difterent.

1403
01:40:04,789 --> 01:40:06,872
他们在哪下车的？

1404
01:40:06,873 --> 01:40:08,538
海滩路
Beach road.

1405
01:40:08,539 --> 01:40:09,997
33号

1406
01:40:09,998 --> 01:40:11,205
他们现在在哪？

1407
01:40:11,206 --> 01:40:16,206
我不知道
I don't know.

1408
01:40:16,956 --> 01:40:18,413
喂，Vikram? 我是Jaya
Hello, Vikram? it's Jaya.

1409
01:40:18,414 --> 01:40:21,663
发现Rajsekharan在伦敦

他有4、5个不同身份的护照
He holds four to five passports under difterent names.

1411
01:40:24,831 --> 01:40:28,205

So in London, he did have a crucial meeting in Madras cafe.

1412
01:40:28,206 --> 01:40:31,122

1413
01:40:31,123 --> 01:40:32,330
不知道

1414
01:40:32,331 --> 01:40:34,455
但是我确实为了点别的事打过来的
But I actually called for something else.

1415
01:40:34,456 --> 01:40:37,913
真的，真的很重要。你必须知道这事儿。
It's really, really important and you need to know this.

我后天就去新德里

1420
01:40:45,289 --> 01:40:46,788
我们后天见

1423

他们买了很多工业化学药剂

1426

这些是普通人不会买的

1427
01:41:29,039 --> 01:41:31,163
他们来自哪里？-我不知道

1428
01:41:31,164 --> 01:41:32,788
但是他们绝不是本地人
But they weren't locals.

1429
01:41:32,789 --> 01:41:34,872
如果还有消息请及时通知我
Let me know if you find anything else.

1430
01:41:34,873 --> 01:41:37,330
好的，先生

就在Jaffna和Madras之间

1441

也许他们在重新确认目标

1442

好的，找出新目标，随时通知我。-好的，先生

01:43:16,706 --> 01:43:20,913
电话里你看不到这个
I couldn't share this with you over the phone.

1469
01:43:20,914 --> 01:43:23,830
我觉得没时间了
I don't think there's much time.

1470
01:43:23,831 --> 01:43:27,663
四天前，这笔钱被转入了LTF的账户
Four days hack, this amount was transferred into the LTF account.

1471

也就是说这是最后的确认了？

1472
01:43:30,123 --> 01:43:32,080
对任何一个职业，

交了钱都是最终确认了

你从哪拿到这个的？

我一直在调查这些银行

发现，有些银行都是假的

它们只存在几天，几个月，然后

他会要求一个政治解决方案
'He'll demand a political solution.'

1485
01:44:05,414 --> 01:44:08,080
现在，我们只需要表现出

还有人知道你在这吗？

01:59:19,873 --> 01:59:22,122
就是这样
Just like that.

1649
01:59:22,123 --> 01:59:24,955
他犯了什么错
What was his fault?

1650
01:59:24,956 --> 01:59:26,997
他还这么年轻
He was so young.

1651
01:59:26,998 --> 01:59:29,122
我们努力了
We tried.

1652
01:59:29,123 --> 01:59:32,997
但失败了 -总理让民众保持冷静
But we lost. - 'President has requested people to stay calm.'

1653
01:59:32,998 --> 01:59:37,998
世界各国的领导人发来慰问
'Leaders all across the world have expressed their condolences.'

1654
01:59:45,289 --> 01:59:49,205
一段时间过去了  -走！走！走！
'After some time..' - Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

1655
01:59:49,206 --> 01:59:53,622
调查小组已逮捕部分罪犯
'The investigation team arrested a few suspects.'

1656
01:59:53,623 --> 01:59:58,623
一些罪犯在被捕前自杀
'And a few suspects committed suicide hefore they could he arrested.'

1657
02:00:11,289 --> 02:00:16,289
我向特别调查小组提交了报告
'And I suhmitted my report to the special investigation team.'

1658
02:00:20,706 --> 02:00:23,830
委员会感谢您的调查
This commission appreciates your investigations.

1659
02:00:23,831 --> 02:00:25,580
是，我们会参考的
And yes, we will consider them.

1660
02:00:25,581 --> 02:00:29,913
但是，Vikram先生，我们需要确凿的证据
But, Mr. Vikram, we need solid evidence.

1661
02:00:29,914 --> 02:00:31,372
我从没意识到...
'I'd never realized that...

1662
02:00:31,373 --> 02:00:36,373
..这个世界对我们的总理是这么危险
...the world is so threatened hy our Prime Minister.'

1663
02:00:36,706 --> 02:00:41,706
几天后RD先生辞职了
'RD sir resigned after a few days.'

1664
02:00:42,998 --> 02:00:47,622
我希望你三思后再做决定
I hope you've given this decision of yours a thought.

1665
02:00:47,623 --> 02:00:52,623
好
Yes.

1666
02:00:55,664 --> 02:01:00,664
我自愿退休并来到这里
And I took a voluntary retirement and came here.

1667
02:01:00,748 --> 02:01:05,748
您刚刚所说的只是一场巧合
Whatever you just said could also he just a coincidence.

1668
02:01:05,873 --> 02:01:07,330
不 神父
No, Father.

1669
02:01:07,331 --> 02:01:12,331
这场阴谋就是按照计划进行的
This conspiracy was played out just as it was planned.

1670
02:01:14,039 --> 02:01:17,955
而且 我迟了一步
And I was late.

1671
02:01:17,956 --> 02:01:21,080
但我不能与他针锋相对
But I couldn't compete with him.

1672
02:01:21,081 --> 02:01:24,163
他们太强大了
They were powerful.

1673
02:01:24,164 --> 02:01:27,997
在这场博弈中 我们失去了敬爱的总理
And In this game we lost our Prime Minister.

1674
02:01:27,998 --> 02:01:31,872
和一些泰米尔人 -他们的未来
And the Lankan Tamils - their future.

1675
02:01:31,873 --> 02:01:33,372
那么谁赢了？
Then who won?

1676
02:01:33,373 --> 02:01:35,913
不知道
I don't know.

1677
02:01:35,914 --> 02:01:38,997
或许每个人都是输家
Perhaps it was everyone's loss.

1678
02:01:38,998 --> 02:01:41,913
Anna也是？
And Anna?

1679
02:01:41,914 --> 02:01:46,538
一位革命者一定也是一名恐怖主义者
One man's revolutionary is another man's terrorist.

1680
02:01:46,539 --> 02:01:51,288
Anna解放了人类
Anna is revolutionary for his people.

1681
02:01:51,289 --> 02:01:53,955
但我还是失去了总理
But I lost my Prime Minister.

1682
02:01:53,956 --> 02:01:58,956
你现在将要干嘛？
What will you do now?

1683
02:01:59,206 --> 02:02:02,747
Ruhy的父亲给了我这个...
Ruhy's father gave this to me...

1684
02:02:02,748 --> 02:02:04,997
...在我们结婚那天

1685
02:02:04,998 --> 02:02:09,913
一个结婚礼物
A wedding gift.

1686
02:02:09,914 --> 02:02:14,914
精神上无所畏惧 就会高昂头颅
Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high..

1687
02:02:15,789 --> 02:02:19,413
知识自由...

1688

世界还没有被狭隘的城墙

1689
02:02:24,623 --> 02:02:27,955

1690
02:02:27,956 --> 02:02:31,788
说真话..
Where words come out from the depth of truth..

1691
02:02:31,789 --> 02:02:36,789
不知疲倦追求完美..
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection..

1692
02:02:36,914 --> 02:02:40,913
理智没有迷失在
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way..

1693
02:02:40,914 --> 02:02:43,955
充斥死亡沉闷的沙漠里
Into the dreary desert sand of dead hahit..

1694
02:02:43,956 --> 02:02:46,788
你自己主导自己
Where the mind is led forward hy thee..

1695
02:02:46,789 --> 02:02:50,455
每一个开阔的思想和行动
Into every-widening thought and action..

1696
02:02:50,456 --> 02:02:53,955
进入到一个自由的天堂 神父
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father,

1697
02:02:53,956 --> 02:02:55,372
让我的国家觉醒吧

1698
02:02:55,373 --> 02:03:00,373
