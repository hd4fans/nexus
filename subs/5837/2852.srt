来吧，詹姆森
Bets around, bets around.
Let's go, Jameson.

10
00:01:45,169 --> 00:01:48,662
每个人都下了么？
阿特金斯？阿特金斯？
Everybody in? Atkins, Atkins?

11
00:01:49,574 --> 00:01:52,237
哦，来吧，伙计
Oh, come on, man, let's go.

12
00:01:53,144 --> 00:01:56,410
不，伙计，你姐还没把支票寄给我呢
No, man, your sister
didn't send me that check yet.

13
00:02:12,396 --> 00:02:15,264
不不，是这么玩的--
德克萨斯纸牌是这么玩的
No, this is how you play the--
This is how you play Texas Hold'em.

14
00:02:15,466 --> 00:02:17,594
你刚刚告诉我们怎么玩法！
You just told us how to play it!

15
00:02:18,903 --> 00:02:21,634
德克萨斯纸牌是这么玩的
This is how you play Texas Hold'em.

16
00:02:24,542 --> 00:02:27,569
你再翻一张牌
这是他妈的第四张...
Will you flip another card.
This is the fourth fucking...

17
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:33,049
- 炸弹
- 你出什么牌，迈尔文？
- Four of a kind.
- What do you got, Melvin?

18
00:02:35,253 --> 00:02:36,516
迈尔文，伙计，你想干嘛？
Yo, Melvin, man,
what you gonna do,

19
00:02:36,721 --> 00:02:38,986
你是打牌还是孵蛋啊？
you gonna play the cards
or you gonna hatch them?

20
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:43,287
我才不想孵蛋
我得马上跑去提点款
I ain't gonna hatch them. I need to
run out to the ATM real quick.

21
00:02:45,196 --> 00:02:46,789
外边应该会有...
There's gotta be a...

22
00:02:46,998 --> 00:02:49,024
会有一家7-11（超市）
Gotta be a 7-Eleven
out there somewhere.

23
00:02:53,304 --> 00:02:54,363
给我两张
Let me get two.

24
00:03:31,075 --> 00:03:32,737
为什么我们不走直路
So why don't we just go directly in.

25
00:03:33,177 --> 00:03:35,271
顺着这条路，可以直奔目标
Right up this route, straight in.

26
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,173
哦，明白了，你就喜欢走荒无人烟的道
Yes, well, I see the captain
enjoys the road less traveled.

27
00:03:39,383 --> 00:03:41,511
不, 我只是不喜欢拉着队伍沿着大路...
No, the captain enjoys
not going down the highway,

28
00:03:41,718 --> 00:03:45,850
成了任人宰割的对象
dragging his ass so every Tom, Dick
and Qaddafi can take a whack at it.

29
00:03:46,723 --> 00:03:48,090
这里不太妙
It's very bad here.

30
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,691
这里，这儿也是
It's bad here, it's still bad here.

31
00:03:51,895 --> 00:03:53,922
而且我听说，这儿也不太妙
And I've heard it's bad
right down here.

32
00:03:54,364 --> 00:03:56,300
- 哪儿都不太妙，唔？
- 是啊
- Bad everywhere, huh?
- Yeah.

33
00:03:56,499 --> 00:03:57,559
有地雷？
Mines?

34
00:03:58,168 --> 00:03:59,899
很难对付，都是瑞典货
Tricky. Swedish-made.

35
00:04:06,776 --> 00:04:09,804
没人跟我提到过地雷的事啊
The man didn't say anything
about mines to me.

36
00:04:10,614 --> 00:04:12,516
肖中士
Sergeant Shaw.

37
00:04:17,554 --> 00:04:20,024
-中士
-长官
- Sergeant.
- Sir.

38
00:04:20,223 --> 00:04:22,489
两分钟后出动
Rolling in two minutes.

39
00:04:22,692 --> 00:04:24,093
是，长官
Yes, sir.

40
00:04:24,928 --> 00:04:26,329
你还好么？
You okay?

41
00:04:27,063 --> 00:04:28,726
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

42
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:32,627
两分钟
Two minutes.

43
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,963
伙计，给我两张牌
Yo, give me two cards, man.

44
00:04:56,926 --> 00:04:58,919
上尉叫我们准备行动
Captain says we're moving out.

45
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:01,189
所以...
So...

46
00:05:06,403 --> 00:05:09,863
嘿, 那屁小子需要个伴
还要人抱抱
Hey, that cat needs a friend.
And a hug.

47
00:05:10,874 --> 00:05:13,640
就在临近“沙漠风暴”行动的时候
It was just before Desert Storm.

48
00:05:13,843 --> 00:05:17,246
我们在伊拉克控制的地区做例行侦察
We were on a routine recon
inside Iraqi-controlled terrain,

49
00:05:17,447 --> 00:05:19,246
评估敌军实力
assessing enemy troop strength

50
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:23,785
因为萨达姆・侯赛因宣称
这将会是场无比激烈的战争
for what Saddam Hussein promised
would be the mother of all wars.

51
00:05:25,155 --> 00:05:27,648
我和肖中士在领头车上
I'm in the lead vehicle
with Sergeant Shaw

52
00:05:27,857 --> 00:05:31,056
还有我们的向导, 一个私人承包商
and our guide, a civilian contractor.

53
00:05:31,261 --> 00:05:34,061
夜色清静，有星星，但没有月亮
The night is clear.
Stars, but no moon.

54
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,991
有埋伏！
Ambush!

55
00:05:41,905 --> 00:05:43,374
坐稳了
Hang on.

56
00:05:50,713 --> 00:05:53,241
下车
听我指示！听我指示！
Exit the vehicle.
On me! On me!

57
00:05:53,649 --> 00:05:55,017
照明弹,中士
Get a flare up, sergeant.

58
00:06:04,226 --> 00:06:07,596
敌人逃跑了！追过去！追过去！
靠左！
Enemy dismount! Go after, go after!
Stay left!

59
00:06:07,796 --> 00:06:09,266
掩护，掩护，掩护！
Covering, covering, covering!

60
00:06:09,465 --> 00:06:10,935
靠右！
Bear right!

61
00:06:11,133 --> 00:06:12,967
快，快，快！
Move it, move it, move it!

62
00:06:31,353 --> 00:06:32,846
马高上尉！
Captain Marco!

63
00:06:35,224 --> 00:06:36,524
长官？
Sir?

64
00:06:37,493 --> 00:06:39,054
你害怕了么？
Was you scared?

65
00:06:40,896 --> 00:06:42,764
害怕？嗯...
Scared? Well...

66
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:46,394
根本没有时间让你害怕
...there was really no time
to be scared.

67
00:06:47,503 --> 00:06:50,964
将个人生死置之度外
With complete disregard
for his own life,

68
00:06:51,173 --> 00:06:54,805
雷蒙德・肖中士，单枪匹马
Sergeant Raymond Shaw
engaged single-handedly

69
00:06:55,377 --> 00:06:57,280
与整整一个连的敌军交战
an entire company of the enemy.

70
00:07:01,517 --> 00:07:04,421
肖中士被授予荣誉勋章
Sergeant Shaw was awarded
the Medal of Honor.

71
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,114
推荐书是我亲手签名送呈的
I signed the recommendation myself.

72
00:07:08,457 --> 00:07:10,121
先生，请说
Yes, sir.

73
00:07:10,325 --> 00:07:12,228
你受伤了么？
Were you wounded?

74
00:07:12,428 --> 00:07:13,625
是的，我受伤了
I was, I was injured.

75
00:07:14,196 --> 00:07:17,464
脑震荡，失去知觉，肖中士接管了指挥权
Concussion, lost focus.
Sergeant Shaw, he took command.

76
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,102
少校？
Major?

77
00:07:19,968 --> 00:07:22,997
- 请说
- 你们部队有伤亡么？
- Yes.
- Did your unit sustain any casualties?

78
00:07:23,205 --> 00:07:27,508
有，一等兵爱德华德・英格拉姆
Yes. PFC Edward lngram,

79
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:31,910
一等兵罗伯特・贝克三世牺牲了
PFC Robert Baker lll
were killed.

80
00:07:32,381 --> 00:07:34,978
这荣誉勋章，国会荣誉勋章
Now, the Medal of Honor,
Congressional Medal of Honor,

81
00:07:35,284 --> 00:07:38,814
是所有战士所向往的最高荣誉
is the highest award that any soldier
could aspire to.

82
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:41,754
今天我所谈到的那些勇士们的事迹
What these brave men
that I've talked about today did

83
00:07:41,957 --> 00:07:44,451
应该永远不被世人遗忘
should never be forgotten.

84
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:50,033
自1917年以来，在服役的
3000万名美军士兵中
Since 1 91 7, there have only been
970 Medals awarded,

85
00:07:50,231 --> 00:07:54,296
只颁发过970枚勋章
out of a total of 30 million
Americans at arms.

86
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:56,368
谁知道呢
Who knows.

87
00:07:56,571 --> 00:07:59,169
也许有一天
在你们这些优秀的青年中会有一个人
Maybe one day,
one of you fine young men

88
00:08:00,174 --> 00:08:03,409
因为保卫我们伟大的祖国而被授予这勋章
will earn that medal
in defense of this great nation.

89
00:08:05,546 --> 00:08:06,642
请说
Yes.

90
00:08:06,848 --> 00:08:10,549
马高少校，我谨代表1094和1128部队
Major Marco,
on behalf of Troops 1 094 and 1 1 28,

91
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,416
在此对你表示感谢
just wanna thank you

92
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,489
感谢你前来作这场关于荣誉勋章的演讲
for coming to speak to us
about the Medal of Honor

93
00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:18,527
还有你在军队中有趣的经历

谢谢聆听

95
00:08:26,601 --> 00:08:27,594
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

96
00:08:28,002 --> 00:08:30,531
你曾希望那是你吗？
You ever wish it had been you?

97
00:08:31,205 --> 00:08:33,109
对不起，你说什么？
I'm sorry, excuse me?

98
00:08:34,275 --> 00:08:36,213
赢得勋章
Won the Medal.

99
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:38,874
成为...成为英雄
Been-- Been the hero.

100
00:08:40,014 --> 00:08:43,681
那个，先生，我只是...
我只是对自己能亲身经历这一切感到骄傲
Well, sir, I'm just--
I'm just proud that I was there.

101
00:08:43,885 --> 00:08:45,379
谢谢
Thank you.

102
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,087
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

103
00:09:10,578 --> 00:09:12,914
- 马高少校？
- 是
- Major Marco?
- Yes.

104
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:16,716
艾尔・迈尔文，长官
Al Melvin, sir.

105
00:09:19,787 --> 00:09:21,486
迈尔文下士
Corporal Melvin.

106
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,924
你的部下，“沙漠风暴”
From your unit, Desert Storm.

107
00:09:25,893 --> 00:09:29,025
迈尔文下士，你好吗？
Corporal Melvin. How you doing?

108
00:09:31,566 --> 00:09:33,902
我做了一些梦，长官
I have these dreams, sir.

109
00:09:34,402 --> 00:09:36,704
- 梦？
- 是的，长官
- Dreams?
- Yes, sir.

110
00:09:38,105 --> 00:09:41,442
科威特，你和我
Kuwait. It's you and me,

111
00:09:41,642 --> 00:09:44,843
英格拉姆，贝克，还有...
Ingram and Baker and...

112
00:09:46,479 --> 00:09:47,974
雷蒙德・肖
...Raymond Shaw.

113
00:09:49,683 --> 00:09:50,916
哦
Okay.

114
00:09:51,484 --> 00:09:55,050
瞧，我所记得的和你刚刚说的一样
See, I remember it happened
like you just said,

115
00:09:55,255 --> 00:09:56,727
但然后...
and then...

116
00:09:57,691 --> 00:09:59,254
...我又记不清了
...I don't.

117
00:10:00,794 --> 00:10:02,528
嗯...
Well...

118
00:10:02,729 --> 00:10:04,599
我们在那儿打得很辛苦，迈尔文
...we had it pretty rough
over there, Melvin.

119
00:10:04,798 --> 00:10:06,964
过去很久了，记忆是会有偏差
That was a long time ago.
Memories shift.

120
00:10:11,371 --> 00:10:13,503
你有做梦吗，长官？
Do you have dreams, sir?

121
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,176
每个人都做梦，下士
Everybody has dreams, corporal.

122
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,109
不，不是那种
No, not these.

123
00:10:17,811 --> 00:10:19,249
不，我没有
No, I don't.

124
00:10:22,215 --> 00:10:25,712
我把它写了下来
你看，差不多，每天晚上
I write it all down.
You know, like, every night,

125
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,418
每当我醒过来，我试着记下来
right when I wake up,
I try to get it down.

126
00:10:30,624 --> 00:10:32,460
你知道，都是些零星片断
It doesn't always come together,
you know,

127
00:10:32,659 --> 00:10:33,995
我不能记得一清二楚
not everything that I can remember.

128
00:10:35,095 --> 00:10:38,331
也许你应该去退伍军人医院
Maybe you should go
to the V.A. hospital,

129
00:10:38,531 --> 00:10:39,662
找位医生谈谈
talk to one of the doctors.

130
00:10:39,866 --> 00:10:42,032
- 我已经找过了
- 哦，那好
- I've been to doctors, man.
- Okay.

131
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:48,877
我只是...我只是...
I'm just... I'm just...

132
00:10:50,644 --> 00:10:53,277
我只是有点想不通，长官
I'm just a little stuck, sir.

133
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,818
因为我记得，那个，肖...
Because I remember, okay, Shaw...

134
00:10:57,017 --> 00:11:00,150
肖，是的...
肖救了我们，对...
Shaw, okay...
Shaw saving us, right...

135
00:11:00,787 --> 00:11:02,987
...但是那没道理啊，因为...
...but that doesn't make sense,
because...

136
00:11:05,025 --> 00:11:07,294
应该是你才对
...that should've been you.

137
00:11:07,494 --> 00:11:10,627
好吧，如果肖是在那辆悍马上...
Okay, if Shaw is in the Hummer...

138
00:11:11,064 --> 00:11:13,128
...那辆丰田在这里...
...the Toyota is here...

139
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:16,068
好了，先起来，站起来
All right. Just get up, get up.

140
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:17,764
听我说，这...
Listen, it's...

141
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:21,969
这已经过去了，画上句号了
懂吗？你得向前看
That's over with. That's done.
Okay? You gotta move on.

142
00:11:22,175 --> 00:11:24,080
我只是希望，你知道，也许--
What I was hoping is that,
you know, maybe--

143
00:11:24,277 --> 00:11:25,442
你缺钱花吗？
You need some money
or something?

144
00:11:25,645 --> 00:11:26,810
- 不，不，长官
- 等一下
- No, no, sir.
- Wait a minute.

145
00:11:27,013 --> 00:11:29,009
我不需要你的钱
I don't need your money, man.

146
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:31,849
那好吧，很高兴见到你
All right. It was great to see you.

147
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,379
纸袋还是塑料袋，先生？
Paper or plastic, sir?

148
00:11:58,944 --> 00:12:03,649
随着因血腥星期五的事件
而再度引发的公众的焦虑
With public anxiety being rekindled
by the events of Bloody Friday,

149
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:09,191
随着仍然前途未卜的反恐战迈入又一个年度
with the war on terror continuing into
yet another year, no end in sight,

150
00:12:09,388 --> 00:12:12,158
忧虑仍在滋生蔓延
the worries just continue to grow.

151
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,797
民意测验表明越来越多的选民
Polls indicate that
more and more voters

152
00:12:14,993 --> 00:12:18,230
关注起个人家庭安全
are concerned with
personal family safety,

153
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,461
以及经济保障体制
with economic security,

154
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:23,732
担忧越来越多的工职流向海外
fearing more and more jobs
going overseas

155
00:12:23,936 --> 00:12:27,571
或者被非法移民占有
or being taken by
illegal immigrants.

156
00:12:27,773 --> 00:12:31,840
选民关注空气和水的质量
They're concerned with the quality
of air and our water,

157
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:35,542
由于环保法律的倒退
the degradation caused by the
rollback in environmental regulations,

158
00:12:35,748 --> 00:12:39,053
以及宗教和种族分化
导致空气和水源品质退化
by religious and racial polarization,

159
00:12:39,251 --> 00:12:43,853
并伴随着全球人口死亡骤增
with the drumbeat of body bags
coming from all over the globe.

160
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:47,395
美国人民已经为政党更替做好了准备
The American people are ready
for a new agenda.

161
00:12:47,593 --> 00:12:52,434
然而由于本党在众多问题上都大有分歧
But because this party is so
divided on so many issues,

162
00:12:52,631 --> 00:12:56,664
确定副总统候选人很可能会成为
the choice of a vice presidential
nominee may very well be

163
00:12:56,869 --> 00:13:00,834
此次会议代表们协力齐心的要素
the unifying factor for delegates
at this convention.

164
00:13:01,206 --> 00:13:03,840
如果大家因此能推举我
And if this respect propels me
toward the nomination

165
00:13:04,042 --> 00:13:08,485
作为你们的副总统候选人，我将感到无比荣幸
as your vice presidential candidate,
I will be greatly honored.

166
00:13:08,814 --> 00:13:13,553
我们需要向内看，先治理自己的家园
We need to look inward,
attend to our own house.

167
00:13:14,453 --> 00:13:17,986
对我们国家的威胁并不仅仅
来自逍遥法外的恐怖分子
The danger to our country is not only
from some terrorists at large,

168
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,029
那些恐怖分子，顺便提一句
是我们帮忙造成的
terrorists who, by the way,
we've helped engender

169
00:13:21,326 --> 00:13:24,199
是20年失败的对外政策的恶果
with 20 years
of failed foreign policy.

170
00:13:24,396 --> 00:13:29,203
不，真正的威胁来自被剥夺的公民自由
No, the real danger
is from suspending civil liberties,

171
00:13:29,635 --> 00:13:32,109
摈弃“权利和自由法案”
放任我们的恐惧...
gutting the Bill of Rights,
allowing our fear

172
00:13:32,304 --> 00:13:34,608
去摧毁我们民主的理念
to destroy our democratic ideals,

173
00:13:34,807 --> 00:13:38,749
因为一旦我们开始
自我颠覆我们宪法的保障
because once we start overturning
our constitutional protections,

174
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:40,474
我们的敌人就已经赢了
our enemies have won.

175
00:13:43,882 --> 00:13:45,515
雷蒙德？
Raymond?

176
00:13:45,717 --> 00:13:47,623
- 他在这儿
- 亲爱的
- There he is.
- Darling.

177
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,489
怎么，你打算让我站在那儿
像个服务生似的吗？
What, were you gonna make me
stand out there like room service?

178
00:13:55,393 --> 00:13:59,837
我问了楼下的弗里曼小姐，你的女保镖
得力助手弗里曼小姐
I asked downstairs and Miss Freeman,
your wrangler, helpful Miss Freeman,

179
00:14:00,031 --> 00:14:03,940
她说你在这儿练习演讲
she said you were up here
practicing your speech.

180
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,235
说真的我不明白为什么
I don't honestly understand why

181
00:14:06,437 --> 00:14:09,208
你非要孤立自己，雷蒙德
you insist upon
isolating yourself, Raymond.

182
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,541
大家都崇拜你，他们渴望与你作伴
People adore you,
they crave your company,

183
00:14:11,742 --> 00:14:13,182
可你却在这里
and yet here you are,

184
00:14:13,377 --> 00:14:15,716
躲藏起来就像是个...
holed up as if you were some sort of

185
00:14:15,913 --> 00:14:19,583
感情有问题的人，像你父亲似的
emotionally challenged individual
like your father.

186
00:14:19,784 --> 00:14:24,524
闭嘴，汤姆
而不是雷蒙德・普兰蒂斯・肖
Shut up, Tom.
Instead of Raymond Prentiss Shaw,

187
00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:27,394
英俊，聪明
handsome, intelligent,

188
00:14:27,592 --> 00:14:30,625
人们爱戴的战争英雄，本党的擎天柱石
people-loving war hero
with a great deal to offer his party.

189
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,065
- 不
- 也是本国的
- No.
- And his country.

190
00:14:33,264 --> 00:14:34,363
不
No.

191
00:14:34,565 --> 00:14:36,301
- 不什么？
- 不
- No, what?
- No.

192
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,031
我都还没问呢
I haven't even asked you
a question yet.

193
00:14:38,236 --> 00:14:40,006
不--对于你那些将要问的问题
No to the question
you're going to ask.

194
00:14:40,204 --> 00:14:42,270
不--对于你那些只是
装个样子问一下的问题
No to all of the questions
you pretend to want to ask.

195
00:14:42,473 --> 00:14:43,606
你的头发太无精打采了
Your hair is too flat.

196
00:14:43,808 --> 00:14:45,715
不--还有你不可以使你那些惯用的伎俩
And no, you may not engage
in your usual backdoor

197
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,884
还有那条领带...
And that tie...

198
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:49,610
把我推上总统候选人的位置
political thuggery to shovel me
onto the presidential ticket.

199
00:14:49,981 --> 00:14:53,048
领带不对，要用再休闲些的
Tie's wrong. Something less busy.

200
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,853
哦，你对当候选人不感兴趣
Oh, you're not interested.

201
00:14:57,054 --> 00:15:00,030
我当然感兴趣
否则我就不会在这里了
Of course I'm interested.
I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.

202
00:15:00,224 --> 00:15:02,563
但这不意味着
But not if it means attacking
the reputation

203
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,428
攻击一个像汤姆・乔丹
那样的政治家的声誉
of a statesman like Tom Jordan,

204
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:07,104
我肯定这是你计划的一部分
which I am sure
was part of your plan.

205
00:15:07,298 --> 00:15:13,073
对不起，我什么时候攻击过
乔丹参议员了，尽管--
Excuse me, when have I ever
attacked Senator Jordan, despite--

206
00:15:13,938 --> 00:15:15,003
尽管什么？
Despite what?

207
00:15:16,107 --> 00:15:18,105
尽管他女儿那年夏天在海滨
Despite the shameful way
his daughter toyed with you

208
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:20,546
那么厚颜无耻地玩弄你
that summer at the shore.

209
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,953
你把她赶走了，妈妈
我们可得实事求是--
You chased her away, Mother,
let's not have any illusions about--

210
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:27,556
她和你不是一类人
但如果你非要说是这么回事...
She wasn't in your league, but if that's
the way you choose to remember it...

211
00:15:27,752 --> 00:15:29,954
你毁了我们所有的在一起的可能--
You destroyed any possibility
of us ever--

212
00:15:30,154 --> 00:15:33,619
亲爱的，你把事情想得
过于单纯了点，但没关系
Honey, you are oversimplifying things
a little bit, but it's okay.

213
00:15:33,925 --> 00:15:36,059
我会置身事外的
I'll stay out of it.

214
00:15:37,328 --> 00:15:38,597
我保证
You have my word.

215
00:15:40,765 --> 00:15:44,230
谢谢，谢谢
Thank you. Thank you.

216
00:15:45,937 --> 00:15:49,675
我想你们都知道我的母亲
埃莉诺・普兰蒂斯・肖参议员
I think you all know my mother,
Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw.

217
00:15:52,309 --> 00:15:55,309
而你们中的一些人，毫无疑问
还记得我的父亲
And some of you, no doubt,
remember my father,

218
00:15:55,512 --> 00:15:58,512
已故的约翰・肖参议员
the late Senator John Shaw.

219
00:16:00,984 --> 00:16:05,053
我很荣幸能在国会任职两期
I've been honored to serve
my two terms in Congress.

220
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,390
但我也是在权位高处长大的
But I also grew up on the Hill.

221
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,795
我知道职业政客是怎么玩这个游戏的
I've seen how the game is played
by professionals,

222
00:16:10,994 --> 00:16:12,765
政治交易是如何互惠互利的
how deals are struck,

223
00:16:12,963 --> 00:16:16,270
委员会受恫吓，议案被买卖
committees bullied,
agendas bought and sold.

224
00:16:16,466 --> 00:16:20,376
借此向我的母亲道声歉
我希望继续当个外行人
And with apologies to my mother,
I wish to remain an amateur.

225
00:16:21,972 --> 00:16:26,383
我坚信民主政治是不容妥协的
I believe democracy
is not negotiable.

226
00:16:28,645 --> 00:16:33,647
我坚信消除全世界和本国的恐惧并重获自由
I believe that freedom from fear
in the world at large and here at home

227
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:36,190
是不容妥协的
is not negotiable.

228
00:16:39,322 --> 00:16:43,266
我知道如今等待着美国人的有多少恐惧
I know how much Americans
have to fear today.

229
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,993
但我可以告诉你们，我曾经体验过
But I can tell you
that I've been there.

230
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:50,001
我曾在前线和敌人直接交战
I've faced the enemy firsthand
on the battlefront.

231
00:16:51,001 --> 00:16:53,409
我知道恐惧是什么滋味
I know what it is to be afraid.

232
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:57,645
但我就是活生生的证明，我们可以获胜
But I am living proof
that we can win.

233
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,851
我们能战胜一切
We can prevail.

234
00:17:02,345 --> 00:17:08,349
我们必须把明天掌握在今天手中，谢谢
We must secure tomorrow today.
Thank you.

235
00:17:15,692 --> 00:17:17,031
- 讹诈？
- 也没什么直接证据
- Bluffing?
- That was the inference.

236
00:17:17,227 --> 00:17:19,362
他们应该对我下跪谢恩
They should be down on their fat,
white knees, thanking me

237
00:17:19,562 --> 00:17:21,868
感谢我解本党于倒悬
for saving this party from
committing political seppuku.

238
00:17:22,065 --> 00:17:24,405
你对他们已经仁至义尽了，参议员
You gave them every opportunity
to do the right thing, senator.

239
00:17:24,601 --> 00:17:28,010
不，我给他们的仁义只有一个
这对我来说已经是法外施恩了
No. I gave them one opportunity and
that was unusually generous of me.

240
00:17:28,405 --> 00:17:29,937
看看你能不能联络一下鲍勃・阿瑟
See if you can get ahold of
Bob Arthur,

241
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,809
我想要见他
because I'm gonna wanna
meet with him.

242
00:17:32,008 --> 00:17:33,574
非常感谢你的安排
Thank you very much
for arranging this.

243
00:17:33,777 --> 00:17:35,548
- 我很感谢
- 不客气
- I appreciate it.
- Sure.

244
00:17:37,714 --> 00:17:39,383
- 部长先生
- 参议员
- Mr. Secretary.
- Senator.

245
00:17:39,582 --> 00:17:41,649
非常感谢你参加这次会议
Thank you very much
for taking this meeting.

246
00:17:41,851 --> 00:17:45,192
- 很高兴再见到你
- 利昂娜，很高兴见到你，利昂娜
- Good to see you again.
- Leona. So nice to see you, Leona.

247
00:17:45,388 --> 00:17:47,956
伙计们，先生们
Buddy. Gentlemen.

248
00:17:49,025 --> 00:17:51,228
不，我以为今早我们已经谈妥了
No, I thought we settled it
this morning.

249
00:17:51,428 --> 00:17:53,301
好，我会和你通气的
All right, I'll keep you posted.

250
00:17:57,499 --> 00:17:59,476
这是最后的决定了
The decision is final.

251
00:17:59,668 --> 00:18:01,804
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

252
00:18:02,738 --> 00:18:05,409
- 珍宁怎么样？
- 参议员
- How's Jeanine?
- Senator.

253
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:08,985
汤姆・乔丹是公认的候选人
Tom Jordan's on the ticket.

254
00:18:09,178 --> 00:18:11,655
现在，我们并不需要你的支持
Now, we don't need your blessing,

255
00:18:11,847 --> 00:18:12,914
但我们会很欢迎你的支持的
but we'd like it.

256
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:18,120
好吧，在正题之前，我...
Okay, so before we get started,
I'm just--

257
00:18:18,587 --> 00:18:20,791
很想知道...
I'm dying to know...

258
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:27,465
是哪个天才，搞出了那段
内布拉斯加州的新闻专访？
...which genius hatched the idea of
pairing a sound bite from Nebraska

259
00:18:27,663 --> 00:18:31,108
说什么让人肉炸弹远离公交车
with a relic who thinks that keeping
suicide bombers off our buses

260
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,369
是违反宪法的
是你吗，高蒂？
is unconstitutional.
Was it you, Gordy?

261
00:18:35,037 --> 00:18:38,038
所有调查表明阿瑟-乔丹组合
All the research indicates
that an Arthur-Jordan ticket

262
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,739
很受美国民众的欢迎
sits quite well
with the American people.

263
00:18:39,942 --> 00:18:42,476
“很受欢迎”能换算成多少票数？
"Sits quite well"
translates into how many votes?

264
00:18:42,678 --> 00:18:44,951
你儿子在纽约外很多地方都不为人所知
Your son is largely unknown
outside of New York.

265
00:18:45,214 --> 00:18:48,681
我是说他的公共服务，国会纪录
I mean, his public service,
his congressional record,

266
00:18:48,884 --> 00:18:50,588
尽管值得赞扬，但还不足以--
while commendable,
is not the kind of thing--

267
00:18:50,786 --> 00:18:51,762
我的儿子是位战斗英雄
My son is a war hero.

268
00:18:51,954 --> 00:18:54,830
阿瑟州长已经同意考虑
Governor Arthur has agreed
to consider Raymond

269
00:18:55,023 --> 00:18:56,829
让雷蒙德・阿瑟入组内阁
for a cabinet-level post.

270
00:18:57,025 --> 00:18:58,524
我们不是来这儿讨论的
We didn't come here
to have a discussion.

271
00:18:58,727 --> 00:19:00,101
我们是来这里讨论的吗？
Did we come here
to have a discussion?

272
00:19:00,295 --> 00:19:03,296
埃莉，你没有足够票数来阻止这事
Ellie, you don't have the votes
to block this.

273
00:19:03,499 --> 00:19:05,942
甚至不能发起第二轮提名投票
Not even to push the nomination
to a second ballot.

274
00:19:06,135 --> 00:19:08,510
哦，吉姆，就算他的竞选对手是个
Oh, Jim, even running against
this cut-and-fold vice president,

275
00:19:08,704 --> 00:19:12,672
内政外交都极度失败的对立党副总统
with his party's record of
abysmal failure at home and abroad,

276
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:16,684
阿瑟州长也还是没法登上总统宝座...
Governor Arthur is still unelectable
to the presidency...

277
00:19:16,879 --> 00:19:18,219
...如果没人助他一臂之力的话
...without help.

278
00:19:18,413 --> 00:19:21,687
想想看，我们无畏的阿瑟
Consider, that our intrepid Arthur

279
00:19:22,184 --> 00:19:24,684
可以坚守住自己家乡，和东北部的票源
can hold on to his own home ground,
and the Northeast,

280
00:19:24,887 --> 00:19:27,956
甚至加利福尼亚，我们在南部仍一无所有
and even California,
we are still dead across the South.

281
00:19:28,157 --> 00:19:29,963
在南部他并不完全没有支持，参议员...
He's not dead completely
in the South, senator...

282
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:32,796
还有西南部，他们占有压倒性的优势
And the Southwest,
where they win by landslides.

283
00:19:32,995 --> 00:19:34,130
我的意思是，这些你们都明白
I mean, you know this.

284
00:19:34,329 --> 00:19:36,738
你们的观察小组，你们的民意测试
都告诉你们这些
Your focus groups,
your polls all tell you this.

285
00:19:36,932 --> 00:19:38,340
它们支持了我所说的，是吧？
They back me up, right?

286
00:19:38,534 --> 00:19:41,103
现在，你们指望汤姆・乔丹帮你们
Now, you're counting on
Tom Jordan to help you get

287
00:19:41,303 --> 00:19:43,212
得到黑人，妇女和大学生的选票
the black vote, women
and college kids.

288
00:19:43,405 --> 00:19:45,644
我的直觉告诉我他不会的
My gut instinct says he won't,

289
00:19:45,841 --> 00:19:51,152
并且指望阿瑟能拉到中部的选票
那儿正是他最弱的地方
and on Arthur to somehow hold
the center, where he is soft at best.

290
00:19:51,346 --> 00:19:53,915
我们确信这已经稳操胜券了，埃莉
We're confident
this is a winning ticket, Ellie.

291
00:19:54,115 --> 00:19:56,616
多少误差幅度，沃恩？
What's your margin of error, Vaughn?

292
00:19:56,817 --> 00:19:58,522
五个百分点？
Five points?

293
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:00,287
三个百分点？
Three?

294
00:20:00,488 --> 00:20:02,591
我可以让它化为乌有，你们也知道的
I can swing that, and you know it.

295
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:05,268
哦，我可以拉走百分之七的票
Oh, I could swing seven
away from you.

296
00:20:05,459 --> 00:20:07,061
这足以影响选举结果了
That's more than enough
to split the ticket.

297
00:20:07,261 --> 00:20:10,138
然后又是四年我们被白宫拒之门外？不
And deny us the White House
another four years? No.

298
00:20:10,331 --> 00:20:11,467
不，就算你也不能
No, not even you.

299
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:14,042
就算你也不能，参议员
你这是在虚言恫吓
Not even you, senator,
will do that, you are bluffing.

300
00:20:14,235 --> 00:20:16,372
哦，不不不，我说得出就做得到
Oh, no, no, no, senator,
I would and I will

301
00:20:16,571 --> 00:20:20,278
而且我会不择手段地捍卫美国
and I will do whatever is necessary
to protect America

302
00:20:20,474 --> 00:20:23,146
不让任何敌对者有可乘之机
from anyone who opposes her.

303
00:20:23,344 --> 00:20:26,187
我不能...
难道我是这房间里唯一一个
I can't...
Am I the only person in this room

304
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,119
读过国家安全局报告的人吗？
who's been reading
these NSA reports?

305
00:20:28,316 --> 00:20:30,658
- 我读过
- 那好，那你该知道
- I've read them.
- All right, then you know,

306
00:20:30,851 --> 00:20:33,955
我们正处于另一次大灾难的边缘
you know we are on the brink
of another cataclysm,

307
00:20:34,155 --> 00:20:36,190
也许是核袭击，就在我们本土
probably nuclear, on our own soil.

308
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,628
哦，埃莉，这也太极端了点
Oh, Ellie, that's a bit extreme.

309
00:20:37,825 --> 00:20:39,530
而且危机并非来自捉摸不定的恐怖分子
And it's not from random terrorists,

310
00:20:39,727 --> 00:20:42,069
而是来自对我们心怀不满的国家
组成的秘密联盟
but from covert alliances
of disaffected nations

311
00:20:42,263 --> 00:20:46,437
因为有乔丹之流相信人性本善
的全球一体化论者存在
who have all been made bold
by this kind of Jordan one-worlder

312
00:20:46,634 --> 00:20:49,112
这些国家越发肆无惮忌
who believes that human beings
are essentially good

313
00:20:49,303 --> 00:20:51,144
乔丹之流还认为我们的强势
我不知道怎么说--
and that our power is somehow,
I don't know,

314
00:20:51,339 --> 00:20:54,011
是可耻或邪恶的，从来不应该加以利用
shameful or evil or never to be used.

315
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,812
毫无疑问，美国人民正在担惊受怕
Make no mistake,
the American people are terrified.

316
00:20:57,011 --> 00:20:59,421
他们知道什么事要发生了
他们可以感觉到
They know something's coming.
They can feel it.

317
00:21:00,314 --> 00:21:03,816
而我们可以继续愚弄哄骗他们
And we can either shovel them
the same old shit and call it sugar

318
00:21:04,018 --> 00:21:06,223
或者我们可以把他们武装起来
or we can arm them.

319
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,695
我们可以用一个年轻有活力
的副总统来武装他们
We can arm them with a young,
vibrant vice president.

320
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:13,358
我们可以给他们热情、能量
给他们一位真心诚意的战斗英雄
We can give them heat, energy,
give them a war hero with heart,

321
00:21:13,561 --> 00:21:16,904
在国人性命安危未定的时候
forged by enemy fire
in the desert in the dark,

322
00:21:17,098 --> 00:21:20,271
在暗夜荒漠中经过战火洗礼的战争英雄
when American lives
hung in the balance.

323
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:40,360
给我们几分钟
Give us a few minutes.

324
00:21:41,822 --> 00:21:43,857
谢谢
Thank you.

325
00:21:44,058 --> 00:21:46,332
部长先生，谢谢你的光临
Mr. Secretary,
thank you for your time.

326
00:21:46,794 --> 00:21:49,170
- 谢谢
- 衷心感谢
- Thank you.
- Really appreciate it.

327
00:21:50,398 --> 00:21:53,536
- 利昂娜，晚上好
- 谢谢，埃莉
- Leona, good evening.
- Thank you, Ellie.

328
00:21:54,435 --> 00:21:56,709
啊，他们需要自己做决定
Well, they're gonna have to make
their own decisions.

329
00:21:56,903 --> 00:21:59,781
我很荣幸地...
I am proud...

330
00:22:00,373 --> 00:22:02,909
宣布下届的...
...to offer into nomination

331
00:22:03,109 --> 00:22:08,956
美国副总统提名候选人的名字是：
the name of the next vice president
of these United States:

332
00:22:09,149 --> 00:22:12,652
雷蒙德・肖！
Raymond Shaw!

333
00:22:12,852 --> 00:22:14,626
一个惊人的事态发展
24小时前...
A remarkable development.
Twenty-four hours ago,

334
00:22:14,821 --> 00:22:16,527
纽约国会议员雷蒙德・普兰蒂斯・肖
New York Congressman
Raymond Prentiss Shaw

335
00:22:16,723 --> 00:22:18,599
甚至没有被提名为...
wasn't even being mentioned
as a possible candidate

336
00:22:18,792 --> 00:22:21,567
四年之后下届选举的副总统候选人
for the vice presidential nomination
four years from now,

337
00:22:21,761 --> 00:22:23,831
更别说被提上本次大会的议程
much less this current convention.

338
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:27,033
今晚大会中爆出令人难以置信的消息
Some incredible news
from the convention floor tonight.

339
00:22:27,267 --> 00:22:28,973
就像是在肯塔基州马赛的决赛冲刺中
Like a long shot
catching the favorite

340
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:31,045
突然跑出了一匹黑马
on the back stretch
of the Kentucky Derby,

341
00:22:31,237 --> 00:22:33,808
雷蒙德・肖击败了
托马斯・乔丹参议员
Raymond Shaw has overtaken
Senator Thomas Jordan

342
00:22:34,007 --> 00:22:36,885
获得了副总统候选提名
to gain the vice presidential
nomination.

343
00:22:37,077 --> 00:22:41,252
雷蒙德・肖承继了传奇性的
普兰蒂斯家族王朝的血统
Raymond Shaw bears the lineage
of the fabled Prentiss family dynasty.

344
00:22:41,648 --> 00:22:46,028
是传奇实业家兼外交官
泰勒・普兰蒂斯的孙子
Grandson of legendary industrialist
and diplomat Tyler Prentiss,

345
00:22:46,219 --> 00:22:49,461
颇受争议的爱莉诺・普兰蒂斯・肖议员的儿子
son of controversial
Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw,

346
00:22:49,656 --> 00:22:52,033
他母亲接替了丈夫
who took over the seat
vacated by her husband,

347
00:22:52,225 --> 00:22:53,498
那位受人尊敬的约翰・肖参议员
空下来的席位
the esteemed John Shaw,

348
00:22:53,693 --> 00:22:57,401
他于20年前不幸去世
when he died tragically
over 20 years ago.

349
00:22:58,231 --> 00:23:01,268
对很多人来说
雷蒙德・普兰蒂斯・肖是个谜
For many, Raymond Prentiss Shaw
is an enigma.

350
00:23:01,468 --> 00:23:03,379
身价百万的哈佛模范学生
The millionaire
Harvard honors student

351
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,173
入伍参加了步兵
who enlisted in the infantry,

352
00:23:05,372 --> 00:23:08,978
拒绝了军官头衔的任命
refusing the officer's commission
to which he was entitled.

353
00:23:09,175 --> 00:23:10,915
不喜媒体且深居简出
Media-shy and reclusive,

354
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:13,056
雷蒙德・肖的生活
Raymond Shaw's life
was forever changed

355
00:23:13,246 --> 00:23:14,918
在科威特沙场上被永远改变了
on the killing fields of Kuwait,

356
00:23:15,115 --> 00:23:19,085
他由于作战英勇而被授予国会荣誉勋章
where he won the Congressional
Medal of Honor for combat bravery.

357
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:22,493
在闻名遐尔的肖中士的
“失踪巡逻队”中有两名士兵
Two members of Sergeant Shaw's
famed "Lost Patrol, "

358
00:23:22,689 --> 00:23:25,134
一等兵爱德华德・英格拉姆
PFC Edward Ingram

359
00:23:25,325 --> 00:23:28,430
和一等兵罗伯特・贝克三世牺牲了
and PFC Robert Baker III,
were killed.

360
00:23:28,628 --> 00:23:32,097
他们的向导，私人承包商在伏击中失踪
Their guide, a civilian contractor,
disappeared in the ambush.

361
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:36,637
但是肖中士英勇地击退了敌人
But Sergeant Shaw
heroically fought off the enemy

362
00:23:36,836 --> 00:23:39,042
然后引领惊魂未定的
“失踪巡逻队”的幸存者
and guided the shell-shocked
survivors of the Lost Patrol

363
00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:41,946
穿越敌占区抵达安全地带
across hostile terrain to safety.

364
00:23:42,142 --> 00:23:46,249
雷蒙德・肖也许是我所认识的最和善
最勇敢，最热心
Raymond Shaw is probably
the kindest, bravest, warmest--

365
00:23:46,446 --> 00:23:48,357
最无私的人了
Most selfless human being
I've ever known.

366
00:23:48,548 --> 00:23:49,958
这位著名的战争英雄
The celebrated war hero,

367
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:53,927
在“沙漠风暴”后献身于公共事业
who dedicated himself to
public service after Desert Storm.

368
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,033
这位荣誉勋章的获得者
“失踪巡逻队”成员们所爱戴的人
The Medal of Honor winner, beloved
by the men of the Lost Patrol.

369
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:00,393
他很快在他的第二故乡纽约州
He quickly turned his energies
to public service

370
00:24:00,592 --> 00:24:02,435
将精力转向公共事业
in his adopted state of New York.

371
00:24:02,694 --> 00:24:05,231
--革命性的生物遗传技术
--the revolutionary science
of biogenetics,

372
00:24:05,431 --> 00:24:08,310
实际上已经改变了...
which has literally transformed...

373
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,571
马高上尉！
Captain Marco!

374
00:24:14,106 --> 00:24:16,985
革命性的生物遗传技术
The revolutionary science
of biogenetics.

375
00:24:17,176 --> 00:24:20,180
革命性的生物遗传技术
The revolutionary science
of biogenetics,

376
00:24:20,379 --> 00:24:22,757
实际上已经改变了..
which has literally transformed...

377
00:24:26,185 --> 00:24:28,097
- 马高上尉！
- 雷蒙德・肖是我所认识的
- Captain Marco!
- Raymond Shaw is the most selfless

378
00:24:28,287 --> 00:24:29,732
...最无私的人了
human being I've ever known.

379
00:24:29,922 --> 00:24:34,337
雷蒙德・肖也许是我所认识的最和善
最勇敢，最热心...
Raymond Shaw is probably
the kindest, bravest, warmest...

380
00:24:34,526 --> 00:24:37,974
还得注意大脑前额叶的复杂性
Yet note the complexity
of the frontal lobe.

381
00:24:38,163 --> 00:24:40,507
尽管如此...
Nevertheless...

382
00:24:40,699 --> 00:24:42,144
上尉
Captain.

383
00:24:44,136 --> 00:24:45,410
救救我
Help me.

384
00:24:47,239 --> 00:24:48,479
肖中士
Sergeant Shaw.

385
00:24:48,674 --> 00:24:49,948
上尉
Captain.

386
00:24:50,142 --> 00:24:51,587
掐死一等兵贝克，杀了他
Suffocate Private Baker. Kill him.

387
00:24:51,777 --> 00:24:54,781
雷蒙德・肖也许是我所认识的最和善
最勇敢，最热心
Raymond Shaw is probably
the kindest, bravest, warmest,

388
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:59,656
最无私的人了
most selfless human being
I've ever known.

389
00:25:04,089 --> 00:25:06,194
雷蒙德・肖...
Raymond Shaw...

390
00:25:06,391 --> 00:25:10,703
好极了，好极了，继续，雷蒙德
Excellent, excellent.
Go on, Raymond.

391
00:25:11,096 --> 00:25:13,076
很好，很好，雷蒙德
Good, good, Raymond.

392
00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:17,205
雷蒙德・肖也许是我所认识的最和善
最勇敢，最热心
Raymond Shaw is probably
the kindest, bravest,

393
00:25:17,402 --> 00:25:20,008
最无私的人了
warmest, most selfless
human being I've ever known.

394
00:25:41,693 --> 00:25:42,899
没别的意思，少校
No offense, major...

395
00:25:43,929 --> 00:25:46,842
但是我们老让人管着，这真让人不舒服
... but it sort of chaps my ass
that we have to have a babysitter.

396
00:25:47,032 --> 00:25:48,909
我过来就是想确实一下
你们没被哪个空军上将的闺房怨妇...
I'm just here to make sure
you don't get cornered

397
00:25:49,101 --> 00:25:50,910
缠得无法脱身
by some Air Force general's
unhappy wife.

398
00:25:51,803 --> 00:25:54,181
马高少校，看来我们还算走运
Major Marco,
we should be so lucky.

399
00:25:54,406 --> 00:25:55,851
- 很高兴见到你
- 谢谢
- So nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

400
00:25:56,041 --> 00:25:58,385
- 谢谢
- 见到你很高兴
- Thank you.
- Nice to meet you.

401
00:25:58,576 --> 00:25:59,886
雷蒙德・肖
Raymond Shaw.

402
00:26:00,077 --> 00:26:01,819
马高少校，我们的二人巡逻队
Major Marco, this army of two

403
00:26:02,013 --> 00:26:03,994
准备去侦察一下那边的自助吧台了
are gonna do some recon
at the no-host bar.

404
00:26:04,181 --> 00:26:06,958
--这种只会助长敌人气焰的失败的对外政策
--a failed foreign policy which has
only served to galvanize our enemies.

405
00:26:07,518 --> 00:26:09,123
请借过
Excuse me, please.

406
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,893
事实上，调动一个不满份子
组成的杂牌军队...
In fact, mobilizing an ersatz
army of malcontents...

407
00:26:12,089 --> 00:26:15,560
- 斯隆将军，你全权负责
- 没问题
- General Sloan, you lead the charge.
- Absolutely.

408
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,832
威廉姆，嗨，你怎么样？
William. Hi, how are you?

409
00:26:18,029 --> 00:26:20,704
还挺好
你见过我的妻子了吗，帕姆？
All right, good.
Have you met my wife, Pam?

410
00:26:20,898 --> 00:26:23,812
- 你好，最近怎样？
- 你好，鲍勃・阿瑟
- Hello, how are you?
- Hello, Bob Arthur.

411
00:26:24,135 --> 00:26:28,414
我是说，这不应该是我们的邦国要旨吗?
I mean, isn't that supposed to be
the point of this great country of ours,

412
00:26:28,606 --> 00:26:30,416
人人都很重要
that everybody matters.

413
00:26:30,608 --> 00:26:33,454
不只是列席此次宴会的人士
Not just the people at this party.

414
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:40,420
也许那些没资格来这里的人
反倒更为重要
But perhaps more importantly,
those who can't afford to be here.

415
00:26:40,618 --> 00:26:43,327
- 雷蒙德，抱歉打断一下
- 抱歉
- 失陪了
- Raymond. Sorry to interrupt.
- Excuse me.

416
00:26:43,621 --> 00:26:45,659
- 鲍勃，你认识我女儿吧
- 汤姆，我不敢相信
- Bob. You know my daughter.
- Tom, I can't believe it.

417
00:26:45,856 --> 00:26:49,396
当然认识了
乔斯林，很高兴再次见到你
Of course.
Jocelyn, good to see you again.

418
00:26:50,361 --> 00:26:52,535
- 马克
- 埃莉诺
- Mark.
- Eleanor.

419
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:56,406
雷蒙德，你祖父一定会非常为你骄傲的
Raymond, your granddad would be
so goddamn proud of you.

420
00:26:56,601 --> 00:26:57,979
谢谢， 怀特宁先生
Thank you, Mr. Whiting.

421
00:26:58,202 --> 00:27:00,911
雷蒙德, 这位是J.B.约翰斯顿
来自满洲国际集团
Raymond, this is J.B. Johnston,
from Manchurian Global.

422
00:27:01,105 --> 00:27:02,176
- 嗨，你怎么样？
- 幸会
- Hi. How are you?
- Pleasure.

423
00:27:02,373 --> 00:27:03,944
还有大卫・多诺万
他们的常务董事
And David Donovan,
their managing director.

424
00:27:04,141 --> 00:27:06,520
同时也是美国国际政治核心会议的联合主席
And co-chair of
the U.S. International Policy Caucus.

425
00:27:06,711 --> 00:27:07,850
您忠实的支持者，国会议员
Strong supporters, congressman.

426
00:27:08,846 --> 00:27:10,724
他们迫切地要为你效力，亲爱的
They're desperate to be
of service to you, darling.

427
00:27:10,915 --> 00:27:12,759
谢谢，妈妈
我想你赚到酬金了
Thank you, Mother,
I think you've earned your fee.

428
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:15,659
哦，没有的事，我勇敢的理想主义者
Oh, no. My plucky idealist.

429
00:27:16,721 --> 00:27:18,861
那么，先生们，生意如何？
So, gentlemen, how's business?

430
00:27:19,056 --> 00:27:21,060
不太坏， 雷蒙德，生意还不坏
Not bad, Raymond.
Business is not bad.

431
00:27:21,258 --> 00:27:22,636
总是可以更上一层楼的
It could always be better.

432
00:27:22,827 --> 00:27:24,205
再好一点的话，你们的资产...
Any better and you guys
are gonna have

433
00:27:24,395 --> 00:27:25,841
就会超过欧盟了
more assets than
the European Union.

434
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,101
不是已经超过了吗?
Don't we already?

435
00:27:27,531 --> 00:27:31,275
每个伟大的社会
每个伟大的文明
Every great society,
every great civilization,

436
00:27:31,469 --> 00:27:33,507
都会有一支强大的海军作为后盾
always anchored by a great navy.

437
00:27:33,704 --> 00:27:35,378
- 肖议员
- 谢谢
- Congressman Shaw.
- Thanks very much.

438
00:27:35,573 --> 00:27:38,453
见到你很高兴，鲍勃
感谢前来
Nice to see you, Bob.
Thanks for coming.

439
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,717
议员
Congressman.

440
00:27:43,414 --> 00:27:45,190
本・马高
Ben Marco.

441
00:27:45,383 --> 00:27:48,092
我知道，你好，上尉
I know. Hello, captain.

442
00:27:48,786 --> 00:27:50,198
最近好吗？
How you doing?

443
00:27:50,388 --> 00:27:53,199
- 我需要和你谈谈
- 好啊
- I need to talk to you.
- Okay.

444
00:27:53,524 --> 00:27:56,005
噢，我的天，雷蒙德
这么多年了没见了
Oh, my God, Raymond,
it's been so many years.

445
00:27:56,193 --> 00:27:57,673
- 还有呢？
- 我结过婚
- And?
- And I've been married,

446
00:27:57,862 --> 00:27:59,069
- 又离了
- 哦
- I've been divorced.
- Yeah.

447
00:27:59,263 --> 00:28:01,244
嗯，你也许注意到我有那么一点变化
Well, you may have noticed
I've changed a bit myself.

448
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:05,040
不，不，那不是...
不，是的，我注意到了
No. No, that's not...
No, yes, I have noticed.

449
00:28:05,235 --> 00:28:09,242
我知道，那很棒
恭喜你
I see. It's great.
Congratulations.

450
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:10,943
但是我的感情依旧
My feelings haven't, though.

451
00:28:13,476 --> 00:28:15,924
我是说，依旧没变
Changed, I mean.

452
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:20,893
什么感情？什么？
What feelings? What?

453
00:28:22,052 --> 00:28:24,432
乔斯林，我一直在想
Jocelyn, I have never
stopped wondering

454
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:27,866
我们两人之间会怎么样
how things might have turned out
between us

455
00:28:28,058 --> 00:28:30,700
- 如果我母亲没有...
- 雷蒙德
- if my mother hadn't--
- Raymond.

456
00:28:30,894 --> 00:28:33,433
雷蒙德，人无法改写自己的人生
Raymond, people can't just
rewrite their lives.

457
00:28:35,565 --> 00:28:38,343
自从我们分手后...
I haven't had a relationship...

458
00:28:38,535 --> 00:28:40,915
我就没再跟任何人有进一步的交往了
...of any consequence
since we stopped seeing each other.

459
00:28:41,104 --> 00:28:43,586
这对你没有任何意义吗？
Doesn't that say something to you?

460
00:28:44,407 --> 00:28:47,254
嗯，那...
Yeah, that...

461
00:28:47,444 --> 00:28:51,053
那你一定是世界上最孤单的人了
That you must be just about
the loneliest person on this earth.

462
00:28:51,948 --> 00:28:55,591
雷蒙德，那时我们只是孩子
那已经有，嗯，15年了吧
Raymond, we were kids then. It must
have been, what, 1 5 years ago?

463
00:28:55,785 --> 00:28:56,925
是很甜蜜，不过...
It was sweet, but...

464
00:28:57,821 --> 00:28:59,200
乔斯
Joce.

465
00:29:00,023 --> 00:29:02,631
来了，我得走了
Yeah. I have to go.

466
00:29:03,326 --> 00:29:04,307
哦
Yeah.

467
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:05,975
祝竞选好运
Best of luck with the campaign.

468
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:07,701
谢谢
Thank you.

469
00:29:12,469 --> 00:29:13,450
乔斯...
Joce...

470
00:29:13,636 --> 00:29:16,210
雷蒙德・肖中士
Sergeant Raymond Shaw.

471
00:29:20,343 --> 00:29:22,450
我也很想和你谈谈
I wanna talk to you too.

472
00:29:24,781 --> 00:29:26,023
- 现在没空
- 对不起，先生
- Not now.
- Excuse me, sir.

473
00:29:26,216 --> 00:29:27,720
我是说，我知道你很忙，议员--
I mean, I know you're busy,
congressman--

474
00:29:27,917 --> 00:29:29,796
- 不要碰我
- 我很抱歉
- Don't touch me.
- I'm sorry.

475
00:29:29,986 --> 00:29:32,969
对不起，只是，那个--
I'm sorry, it's just that, well--

476
00:29:33,156 --> 00:29:35,138
千万不要碰我
Don't ever touch me.

477
00:29:39,095 --> 00:29:41,771
你好，少校
你尝过泰国炒米粉了没？
Hello, major.
Have you tried the Pad Thai?

478
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:44,639
我听说它棒极了
I'm told it rules.

479
00:29:52,675 --> 00:29:54,748
你希望肖议员会说什么？
What were you hoping
Congressman Shaw would say?

480
00:29:55,145 --> 00:29:56,888
我不知道，先生
I don't know, sir.

481
00:29:57,981 --> 00:30:02,125
关键不在他说或不说什么，而是他的
It's not so much what he said
or didn't say, it was more of his...

482
00:30:02,317 --> 00:30:03,959
...他的态度，他的举止
...attitude, his demeanor.

483
00:30:04,453 --> 00:30:05,730
你在服药吗？
Are you taking your meds?

484
00:30:05,921 --> 00:30:08,131
霍华德中校，恕我直言
Lieutenant Colonel Howard,
with all due respect,

485
00:30:08,323 --> 00:30:10,306
过去的12年以来专家一直告诉我说
I've had over a dozen years
of experts telling me

486
00:30:10,492 --> 00:30:13,271
我有海湾战争综合症
我有外伤遗忘失调症
that I have Gulf War Syndrome,
I have post-traumatic stress disorder

487
00:30:13,462 --> 00:30:16,674
还有其他你叫得出名字的
各类情绪失调症
and every other mood disorder
that you can name.

488
00:30:16,865 --> 00:30:20,316
在这12年里，我一直是个优秀军人
In those 1 2 years,
I've been a good soldier.

489
00:30:20,502 --> 00:30:23,577
而且我一直试图否定
And I've denied what
every nerve ending in my body

490
00:30:23,772 --> 00:30:25,516
我身体里每根神经都在告诉我的真相
is telling me is more real than not.

491
00:30:25,707 --> 00:30:28,054
我每晚都做一个梦
不是千变万化的梦
I've had one dream,
not variations on a dream,

492
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,816
而是完全相同的梦
一夜接着一夜
the same dream.
Night after night--

493
00:30:30,012 --> 00:30:33,087
不，不，对不起
No. No. I'm sorry.

494
00:30:33,282 --> 00:30:35,765
你是在说整个班的美国陆军战士
You're saying that an entire squad
of U.S. Army soldiers

495
00:30:35,951 --> 00:30:37,900
都受到催眠而认为雷蒙德・肖
was hypnotized into believing
that Raymond Shaw

496
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,659
有资格获得荣誉勋章？
deserved the Medal of Honor.

497
00:30:39,955 --> 00:30:42,598
而且从某种意义上说，因为你这个梦
And that somehow,
thanks to your dream,

498
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:45,331
你成了唯一洞悉真相的人了
you're the only one
who knows the truth.

499
00:30:46,061 --> 00:30:49,136
马高少校，你被禁止接近肖议员
Major Marco, you will stay clear
of Congressman Shaw.

500
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:57,552
你要继续药物治疗
And you are to resume
your medication.

501
00:30:57,739 --> 00:30:59,654
这是命令
That is an order.

502
00:30:59,842 --> 00:31:01,415
就这样了，少校
That will be all, major.

503
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,117
此时此刻，一名在反恐战前线的美国士兵
Somewhere right now, an
American soldier in the war on terror

504
00:31:05,314 --> 00:31:07,661
正在为故乡的家人忧心
is worried about his
family back home.

505
00:31:08,383 --> 00:31:11,458
此时此刻，在某个美国小镇
Somewhere right now,
in some small American town,

506
00:31:11,653 --> 00:31:14,432
他的祖母站在厨房里
his grandmother is standing
in her kitchen.

507
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:17,198
她一手拿着药瓶
She's got her medicine bottle
in one hand,

508
00:31:17,392 --> 00:31:20,808
她另一只握着冰箱门把手，心想：
she's opening the refrigerator
with the other and she's thinking:

509
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:24,043
“是买药呢...
"I can pay for my medicine...

510
00:31:25,067 --> 00:31:27,277
...还是买晚餐？
... or I can pay for my dinner.

511
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:30,244
两者不可兼得”
I can't do both. "

512
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:32,618
我相信我们的母亲和祖母们
I don't believe that our mothers
and grandmothers

513
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:35,883
不应该面临这种抉择
在我们这个国家不可以
should have to face that kind of
decision, not in this country.

514
00:31:37,946 --> 00:31:41,124
我相信我们军队中在海外出生入死
I don't believe that the brave men
and women of our armed forces,

515
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,891
的英雄儿女们绝不应该
risking their lives overseas,
should have to worry

516
00:31:44,686 --> 00:31:48,228
为他们远在国内的家人担心
about their families back here
in America.

517
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,534
你们看，在这个国家里有许多裂隙
You see, there are some gaps
in this country...

518
00:31:52,728 --> 00:31:55,610
...许多需要我们填补的鸿沟
... deep chasms
that we need to bridge.

519
00:31:57,432 --> 00:31:59,244
富人和穷人之间
The gap between rich and poor,

520
00:31:59,601 --> 00:32:02,983
政府与民众之间的
between government
and the people,

521
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:06,553
真正的安全和自我感觉的安全之间的
between true security
and the notion of feeling safe.

522
00:32:06,741 --> 00:32:08,987
二楼，三号房间，走廊尽头
Second floor, room three,
end of hall.

523
00:32:09,443 --> 00:32:11,950
真相和...
Between what is real...

524
00:32:12,146 --> 00:32:13,652
难道你不喜欢这家伙吗？
Don't you just love this guy?

525
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,525
...和假相之间的
And what is not.

526
00:32:16,617 --> 00:32:19,329
采取强硬政策对领导人
是难以避免的选择
Tough choices are an unavoidable
element of leadership,

527
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,096
我只是恳请当政者记住
I would just urge the governor
to remember that

528
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:25,867
政府的首要责任...
the primary responsibility
of government...

529
00:32:48,349 --> 00:32:50,128
艾尔・迈尔文
Al Melvin.

530
00:32:52,386 --> 00:32:55,098
艾尔，我是本・马高
你在吗？
Al, it's Ben Marco.
Are you in there?

531
00:33:00,294 --> 00:33:02,244
狐狸进了鸡窝
Fox is in the henhouse.

532
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:04,175
黄鼠狼
Weasel.

533
00:33:05,266 --> 00:33:08,683
黄鼠狼是...
Weasel is...

534
00:33:10,304 --> 00:33:12,481
黄鼠狼就是黄鼠狼
The weasel is a weasel.

535
00:33:14,141 --> 00:33:15,886
先生，我就在外面
Sir, I'll be right outside.

536
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:17,615
什么？
What?

537
00:33:18,312 --> 00:33:20,489
我就在外面，先生
I'll be right outside, sir.

538
00:33:21,315 --> 00:33:22,696
我知道
I know.

539
00:33:23,417 --> 00:33:25,958
- 晚安
- 晚安，先生
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.

540
00:33:27,188 --> 00:33:29,195
- 需要我帮你接一下吗，先生？
- 不
- Shall I get that for you, sir?
- No.

541
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:31,567
- 晚安，先生
- 晚安
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

542
00:33:54,081 --> 00:33:56,429
我给你30秒，妈妈
You have 30 seconds, Mother.

543
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:57,998
你知道是我？
Am I that predictable?

544
00:33:58,285 --> 00:34:00,201
我完全不知道
You have no idea.

545
00:34:00,421 --> 00:34:03,167
我是打电话来恭喜你，没好气先生
I'm calling to compliment you,
Mr. Grumpy.

546
00:34:03,357 --> 00:34:06,342
我认为你今晚表现太棒了
I thought you were
magnificent tonight.

547
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,511
那些电视竞选专家也持同样观点
And so did all the network
campaign experts.

548
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:13,574
还有那套饱含同情，居安思危的作派
And that compassionate
vigilance thing

549
00:34:13,767 --> 00:34:16,548
你运用得恰到好处
is working quite well for you.

550
00:34:17,237 --> 00:34:20,280
- 我也许该改投你的旗下了
- 我刚巧说的是真心话
- I might have to convert.
- I happen to believe in it.

551
00:34:20,473 --> 00:34:22,014
哦，是的，那当然
Oh, yes, of course you do.

552
00:34:22,242 --> 00:34:24,489
- 听着，雷蒙德...
- 晚安，妈妈
- Now, Raymond...
- Good night, Mother.

553
00:34:24,711 --> 00:34:27,356
雷蒙德？什么？不，等等
Raymond? What? No, wait, wait.

554
00:34:28,381 --> 00:34:30,593
- 等一下
- 什么？雷蒙德？
- Hang on a second.
- What? Raymond?

555
00:34:31,084 --> 00:34:32,363
你在吗？
Are you there?

556
00:34:35,021 --> 00:34:36,437
喂?
Yes?

557
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,672
肖中士？
Sergeant Shaw?

558
00:34:39,059 --> 00:34:40,771
你是哪位？
Who is this?

559
00:34:41,494 --> 00:34:44,605
- 雷蒙德 肖中士?
- 是
- Sergeant Raymond Shaw?
- Yes.

560
00:34:44,931 --> 00:34:47,542
雷蒙德・普兰蒂斯・肖?
Raymond Prentiss Shaw?

561
00:34:52,772 --> 00:34:54,279
是
Yes.

562
00:34:54,574 --> 00:34:55,922
听着
Listen.

563
00:34:56,476 --> 00:34:58,051
去你套房的卧室
Go to the bedroom of your suite.

564
00:34:59,245 --> 00:35:01,958
走进那里的门厅
Enter the hallway there.

565
00:35:02,148 --> 00:35:05,760
走到头，打开壁橱
Go to the end and open the closet.

566
00:35:35,048 --> 00:35:37,260
是，谢谢
Yes, thank you.

567
00:35:39,853 --> 00:35:42,464
- 你好， 雷蒙德
- 你好
- Hello, Raymond.
- Hello.

568
00:35:42,689 --> 00:35:44,571
你记得我吗？
Do you remember me?

569
00:35:49,262 --> 00:35:50,746
不，先生，不记得
No, sir, I don't.

570
00:35:50,997 --> 00:35:53,574
很好
我们要做个20分钟的小小的身体检查
Brilliant. We've got 20 minutes
for our little checkup

571
00:35:53,766 --> 00:35:56,616
当然是头部的
先生们，让我们脱下他的外衣
from the neck up, gentlemen,
so if we could take his jacket.

572
00:35:56,803 --> 00:35:58,720
请坐
Please sit down.

573
00:36:01,706 --> 00:36:04,385
不，维拉鲁伯斯先生，我...
军方指派我收集…
No, Mr. Villalobos, I'm just...
The Army's got me gathering

574
00:36:04,576 --> 00:36:07,494
有关焦虑失调症的信息
所以我只是...
information on stress disorders,
so I'm just...

575
00:36:07,711 --> 00:36:11,130
...你明白的，只是做个统计
想知道我的旧部下--
...you know, just running statistics,
trying to find out about my old team--

576
00:36:14,952 --> 00:36:16,961
好吧，听着，威尔逊先生
Well, listen. Mr. Wilson,

577
00:36:17,187 --> 00:36:21,733
内森回家后，他是不是
整天只想着科威特的战事?
when Nathan came home,
was he preoccupied with Kuwait?

578
00:36:21,925 --> 00:36:23,570
我的意思是说，他有没有做恶梦之类的？
I mean, did he have nightmares
or bad dreams

579
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,473
和那边的战争有关的
about the firefight over there?

580
00:36:30,234 --> 00:36:34,882
麻醉膏抹上去的时候你会感到有点凉
You'll feel a little cold
as this anesthetic gel goes on.

581
00:36:39,877 --> 00:36:42,159
针套...
Probe sheath...

582
00:36:42,346 --> 00:36:45,197
...探针
...and probe.

583
00:36:48,752 --> 00:36:51,238
请放松
你放松了么， 雷蒙德？
Please relax.
Are you relaxed, Raymond?

584
00:36:51,455 --> 00:36:52,565
是的，先生
Yes, sir.

585
00:36:52,823 --> 00:36:57,574
现在，雷蒙德，我要在你颅骨上钻一个小洞
Now, Raymond, I am going to drill
a tiny hole in the skull,

586
00:36:57,794 --> 00:37:01,680
为了放入新的植入物
which will allow delivery
of the new implant.

587
00:37:02,266 --> 00:37:05,344
所以，你会感到一点点不舒服
你也许会感到些许压迫
So, what you'll feel is a little
discomfort in the form of pressure

588
00:37:05,536 --> 00:37:07,954
有点压迫感，还会听到剧烈的震动噪音
and also a loud vibrating noise
in your head,

589
00:37:08,138 --> 00:37:12,115
所有这些，当然，都是绝对正常的
all of which, of course,
is completely normal.

590
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:15,548
谢谢
Thank you.

591
00:39:18,234 --> 00:39:21,086
当然，一旦手术完成
Of course, as soon as this
or any task is completed,

592
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:26,192
你就会忘记这件事了
you will already have forgotten
that it ever actually took place.

593
00:39:27,076 --> 00:39:29,086
现在探针进入
Probe going in now.

594
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:40,237
好
Good.

595
00:39:42,024 --> 00:39:43,840
非常好
Excellent.

596
00:39:44,026 --> 00:39:46,479
释放植入物
Releasing implant.

597
00:39:46,662 --> 00:39:49,172
好了
没什么的吧，是不是，雷蒙德？
There. That wasn't so bad,
was it, Raymond?

598
00:39:49,365 --> 00:39:50,681
是，先生
No, sir.

599
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:53,650
很好，没有腐化，没有滑动
That's good. No decay, no slippage.

600
00:39:53,836 --> 00:39:58,053
所有的看起来都完美无瑕
Everything seems to be
in flawless working condition.

601
00:40:23,898 --> 00:40:25,852
现在，雷蒙德
Now, Raymond.

602
00:40:26,067 --> 00:40:29,648
你能想起一等兵贝克和
英格拉姆是怎么死的吗？
Can you remember the deaths
of Private Baker and Private lngram?

603
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:30,847
是的，先生
Yes, sir.

604
00:40:31,072 --> 00:40:33,583
好，请你向我描述一下好吗？
Good. Can you describe them
for me, please?

605
00:40:33,775 --> 00:40:36,855
我们正在伊拉克控制地区执行临行侦察
We're on a routine recon
inside Iraqi-controlled terrain,

606
00:40:37,045 --> 00:40:39,556
评估敌军实力
assessing troop strength.

607
00:40:40,982 --> 00:40:45,371
“我们正在伊拉克控制地区执行临行侦察
"We're on a routine recon
inside lraqi-controlled terrain,

608
00:40:45,553 --> 00:40:46,938
评估敌军实力”
assessing troop strength."

609
00:40:47,122 --> 00:40:49,770
任务顺利完成，在回去的路上--
The mission ends without incident.
We're heading back--

610
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:52,742
“在回司令部的路上
夜色清静，有星星...”
"Toward the command.
The night is clear. Stars..."

611
00:40:52,961 --> 00:40:56,348
夜色清静，有星星， 但没有月亮
The night is clear.
Stars, but no moon.

612
00:40:56,898 --> 00:40:58,180
巡逻队遭遇伏击
The patrol is ambushed.

613
00:40:58,366 --> 00:41:01,617
我们意外遭遇了有直升机援助的地面部队
We're engaged unexpectedly by
ground forces with helicopter support.

614
00:41:01,803 --> 00:41:04,656
敌方使用了火榴弹, 迫击炮
RPG incoming, mortar fire.

615
00:41:04,973 --> 00:41:06,551
“上尉...”
"Captain..."

616
00:41:08,143 --> 00:41:10,495
马高上尉被击中失去了知觉
Captain Marco
is knocked unconscious.

617
00:41:10,678 --> 00:41:14,634
在随后的交战中，
埃迪・英格拉姆被敌军分割在左翼
In the ensuing firefight, Eddie lngram
gets himself separated to the left.

618
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:17,531
贝克前去支援
Baker goes after him.

619
00:41:17,719 --> 00:41:19,832
敌军的一发迫击炮弹令他们当场丧生
An incoming mortar shell
kills them both instantly

620
00:41:20,021 --> 00:41:23,477
我还没来得及确定炮火方位，将之消灭
before I am able to locate and
eliminate the source of the ordnance.

621
00:41:25,293 --> 00:41:28,680
上尉，马高上尉
Captain. Captain Marco.

622
00:41:28,863 --> 00:41:30,350
救救我
Help me.

623
00:41:38,006 --> 00:41:40,859
抱歉，这座位有人吗？
Pardon me. Is this seat taken?

624
00:41:41,476 --> 00:41:45,023
哦, 我知道你喜欢走荒无人烟的道
I see the captain enjoys
the road less traveled.

625
00:42:02,497 --> 00:42:04,576
纸袋还是塑料袋？
Paper or plastic?

626
00:42:06,568 --> 00:42:09,853
哦，好啦，我是那家店里的
Oh, come on.
From the grocery store.

627
00:42:10,038 --> 00:42:13,050
你知道的，在收银台
“纸袋还是塑料袋？”，那就是我
You know, at the checkout stand.
Paper or plastic girl, that's me.

628
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,728
“纸袋还是塑料袋，先生”
"Paper or plastic, sir?"

629
00:42:16,376 --> 00:42:17,830
我经常看到你来
I see you there all the time.

630
00:42:18,011 --> 00:42:20,523
班尼特・马高，用第一国家银行的支票
Bennett Marco.
Checks from First National Bank.

631
00:42:20,714 --> 00:42:25,536
买的是浪漫小说， 方便面
提神药，还有西红柿
Romance novels, instant noodles,
NoDoz and tomatoes.

632
00:42:29,623 --> 00:42:32,408
不管怎么说，我在度假
So anyway, I'm on vacation.

633
00:42:32,593 --> 00:42:34,809
在纽约城四周到处转转
Holiday in the Big Apple
and all of that.

634
00:42:34,995 --> 00:42:37,450
我看见你坐在这里，然后我想，“嘿
And I saw you sitting here
and I said, "Hey,

635
00:42:37,631 --> 00:42:40,519
为什么不过去和他打个招呼？”
why not reach out
and touch someone?"

636
00:42:44,304 --> 00:42:47,226
所以，嗯，我猜你也是去纽约的吧
So, what, I suppose
you're heading to New York City.

637
00:42:47,407 --> 00:42:49,555
嗯，嗯，我...是啊
Yeah, yeah, I'm... Yeah.

638
00:42:50,177 --> 00:42:52,598
公事？休闲？还是两者兼顾？
Business? Pleasure? Both?

639
00:42:52,913 --> 00:42:57,962
哦，我...我有个老朋友
以前的老战友在那里...
Well, I'm just... I got an old friend
up there, an old Army friend that...

640
00:42:58,886 --> 00:43:01,808
他现在从政了，我只是去
Well, he's in politics now
and I'm just gonna

641
00:43:01,989 --> 00:43:04,342
和他叙叙旧
catch up on old times with him.

642
00:43:08,328 --> 00:43:09,873
对不起，你叫什么来着？
I'm sorry, you said your name was...?

643
00:43:10,764 --> 00:43:12,218
欧也妮
Eugenie.

644
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,813
你朋友叫你什么？
What do your friends call you?

645
00:43:15,002 --> 00:43:17,150
我的朋友，他们叫我罗西
My friends, they call me Rosie.

646
00:43:17,571 --> 00:43:19,583
- 罗西？
- 对，瞧，我的全名是
- Rosie?
- Yeah, see, my full name is

647
00:43:19,773 --> 00:43:21,352
欧也妮・罗西
我更喜欢他们叫我罗西
Eugenie Rose.
I like the Rosie part better.

648
00:43:21,541 --> 00:43:24,292
欧也妮，嗯...
Eugenie is, well...

649
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:26,390
...有点娇弱的感觉
...fragile.

650
00:43:26,747 --> 00:43:29,965
是啊，但是，刚刚我问你的时候
你还是说...
Yeah, but still, when I asked you
your name, you didn't say...

651
00:43:30,417 --> 00:43:32,303
你说什么来着？
你说你叫欧也妮
What did you say?
You said Eugenie.

652
00:43:32,486 --> 00:43:34,702
哦，那个...
Yeah, well...

653
00:43:35,255 --> 00:43:39,975
也许我那个时候我感到有点娇弱
...maybe I was feeling fragile
at the time.

654
00:43:49,269 --> 00:43:50,757
你还好吗？
Are you okay?

655
00:43:50,938 --> 00:43:52,290
对不起
Excuse me.

656
00:44:40,419 --> 00:44:41,840
你好，上尉
Hello, captain.

657
00:44:42,588 --> 00:44:44,009
还记得我吗？
Do you remember me?

658
00:45:16,222 --> 00:45:17,575
本
Ben.

659
00:45:18,457 --> 00:45:21,937
嘿，我准备叫辆车
想让我带你到什么地方去吗？
Hey. I'm gonna get a cab.
You want me to drop you somewhere?

660
00:45:22,128 --> 00:45:23,344
不，不用了
No, I'm okay.

661
00:45:23,529 --> 00:45:25,348
好吧，这么说你朋友要来接你了？
Okay. So your friend's
gonna meet you here, then?

662
00:45:25,531 --> 00:45:26,918
不
No.

663
00:45:28,467 --> 00:45:29,888
那好吧
All right.

664
00:45:30,069 --> 00:45:33,117
艾尔多拉多，59970
El Dorado 59970.

665
00:45:35,508 --> 00:45:39,330
这是我的手机号码
如果你...你知道...
It's my cell phone number,
in case you ever... You know.

666
00:45:39,512 --> 00:45:41,525
我喜欢用比较老套的说法--
I like to say it the old-fashioned way.

667
00:45:41,714 --> 00:45:45,103
你能记住吗，还是要我给你刻在胸口上？
Can you remember or should I write it
on your chest with a Sharpie?

668
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:48,203
- 我能记住
- 那好
- I'll remember.
- Okay.

669
00:45:48,888 --> 00:45:51,242
嘿，你有点...
Hey, you're kind of...

670
00:45:51,891 --> 00:45:54,404
要找个地方来歇歇神吗？
You need somewhere to go
to freshen up?

671
00:45:56,195 --> 00:45:57,878
五角大楼的监察人员今天指控
Pentagon watchdogs
today accused

672
00:45:58,064 --> 00:46:00,486
私人资产基金会满洲国际集团
the private equity fund
Manchurian Global

673
00:46:00,666 --> 00:46:04,522
在最近的印尼遭袭事件中
过度抬高血浆
of grossly overpricing plasma
and other critical medical supplies

674
00:46:04,703 --> 00:46:06,818
和其他紧急医疗物资的价格
during the recent
Indonesian incursion,

675
00:46:07,006 --> 00:46:11,294
该公司刚刚获得一项
未经投标的5亿美元合约
even as the company secured
a half-billion-dollar no-bid contract

676
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:14,627
承包了准备向斯里兰卡集结的美军
to provide combat support services
to American soldiers

677
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:17,031
所需的战备物资的供应
preparing to mobilize in Sri Lanka.

678
00:46:29,527 --> 00:46:31,347
到了
There you go.

679
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:33,518
进来吧
Come on in.

680
00:46:33,698 --> 00:46:36,281
这是我堂姐的公寓
This is my cousin's apartment.

681
00:46:36,701 --> 00:46:38,624
- 她在吗？
- 不在
- Is she here?
- No.

682
00:46:38,803 --> 00:46:40,885
就算再破
Be it ever so humble.

683
00:46:41,272 --> 00:46:43,525
还是自己的窝好啊，是不？
No place like home, right?

684
00:46:43,741 --> 00:46:46,961
信不信由你，这里还能看到风景呢
Believe it or not, there's a view.

685
00:46:47,145 --> 00:46:50,262
到防火梯那儿，抬起头
Go to the fire escape
and tilt your head up,

686
00:46:50,482 --> 00:46:52,700
应该还能看见一棵树呢
you can almost see a tree.

687
00:46:54,819 --> 00:46:57,140
- 要喝点什么？
- 不，不用了
- Can I get you something to drink?
- No, I'm fine.

688
00:46:59,757 --> 00:47:02,544
这里有一些减肥茶
I've got some dieter's tea.

689
00:47:02,727 --> 00:47:06,379
有助于你的新陈代谢
如果你相信它的话
It's great for your metabolism,
if you're into that.

690
00:47:06,564 --> 00:47:11,547
要不来点番茄汁？不要？好吧
Or some tomato juice. No? All right.

691
00:47:12,203 --> 00:47:13,887
或者...
Or...

692
00:47:14,072 --> 00:47:15,187
...白开水？
...some water?

693
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,790
- 不必了，谢谢
- 对不起
- No, thank you.
- I'm sorry.

694
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:21,391
我有点紧张，一紧张我就喋喋不休
I'm nervous.
I yak when I get nervous.

695
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,266
你的堂姐在哪里？
Where is she, your cousin?

696
00:47:25,583 --> 00:47:27,574
她跟着“梦女郎”乐队巡回演出去了
She's on tour with Dreamgirls.

697
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:40,047
嘿，你还好吧？
Hey, are you okay?

698
00:47:42,667 --> 00:47:44,055
嗯
Yeah.

699
00:47:46,838 --> 00:47:49,921
我对之前发生的事很抱歉
Look, I'm sorry about
what happened earlier.

700
00:47:50,108 --> 00:47:52,656
你不必向我道歉
You don't have to apologize to me.

701
00:47:53,678 --> 00:47:55,862
我给你冲些茶
I'll make you some tea.

702
00:48:34,885 --> 00:48:38,401
天，柠檬在那儿？好了
Jesus. Where's the lemon? Okay.

703
00:48:39,089 --> 00:48:42,810
- 你没事吧？
- 嗯，我很好
- You okay in there?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

704
00:48:43,393 --> 00:48:46,716
你看，我给你准备了浴巾
你看见了么？
You know, I left you some towels
in there, did you see them?

705
00:48:50,667 --> 00:48:52,818
- 怎么回事？
- 包掉了
- What was that?
- Dropped my bag.

706
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:01,901
本
Ben?

707
00:49:03,146 --> 00:49:04,967
你没事吧？
Are you okay in there?

708
00:49:05,415 --> 00:49:06,770
呼叫本
Earth to Ben.

709
00:49:07,484 --> 00:49:08,873
没事
Yeah.

710
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:12,306
- 真的没事吗？
- 是
- You sure everything's all right?
- Yes.

711
00:49:15,192 --> 00:49:16,740
本？
Ben?

712
00:49:26,136 --> 00:49:27,787
本？
Ben?

713
00:49:28,472 --> 00:49:30,259
本？
Ben?

714
00:49:31,141 --> 00:49:32,359
本
Ben.

715
00:49:36,847 --> 00:49:38,270
本?
Ben?

716
00:50:01,838 --> 00:50:03,193
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

717
00:50:07,577 --> 00:50:09,296
你看见那个了吗？
Did you see that?

718
00:50:13,083 --> 00:50:15,234
在我手里的东西
What I had in my hand.

719
00:50:19,288 --> 00:50:22,146
这不是幻觉，德尔皮
它就在我手里
I wasn't hallucinating, Delp.
I held it in my hand.

720
00:50:22,325 --> 00:50:24,716
他们都是这么说，马高
That's what they all say, Marco.

721
00:50:24,927 --> 00:50:28,012
“沙漠风暴”期间你们
都沾上了些邪恶的东西
Some wicked shit got sprayed
on you guys during Desert Storm.

722
00:50:28,564 --> 00:50:31,717
我是说，除了贫铀弹的辐射微尘之外
Besides all the depleted uranium,
I mean.

723
00:50:32,368 --> 00:50:34,452
我认识几个突击队员
I personally know of
a couple of Rangers

724
00:50:34,637 --> 00:50:37,426
他们发誓现在不戴上
有色眼镜就成了瞎子
who swear that they see only
in tertiary colors now,

725
00:50:37,606 --> 00:50:40,691
- 德尔皮
- 还说还说只要一靠近康爱迪生公司的变压器
- Delp.
- and can pick up sports talk radio

726
00:50:40,876 --> 00:50:44,359
脑子里就能接收到体育广播
in their cortical block if they get
too close to a Con-Ed transformer.

727
00:50:44,747 --> 00:50:46,672
这不是海湾战争综合症
It's not Gulf War Syndrome.

728
00:50:53,489 --> 00:50:59,646
军队确实试用过一种微型
可植入的身份识别装置
The Army did try this
tiny, implantable lD thing.

729
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:04,515
可以植入皮下，然后像条形码那样扫描
You could imbed it under the skin,
then scan it like a bar code

730
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:07,353
记录了一些急救信息
for medical emergency information:

731
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:10,025
血型，DNA等等
Blood type, DNA.

732
00:51:10,206 --> 00:51:12,290
哦，军方从没给我装过这个
Well, the Army never put one in me.

733
00:51:16,078 --> 00:51:18,367
这是你以为的，伙计
That you know of, man.

734
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:22,638
你以为如此
That you know of.

735
00:51:33,329 --> 00:51:36,619
今天美军飞机轰炸了几内亚的几处选定目标
U. S. planes bombed selected sites
in Guinea today, acting on intelligence

736
00:51:36,799 --> 00:51:40,191
根据情报，这个非洲国家的军事政权
that the African nation's military
regime had secretly resumed

737
00:51:40,369 --> 00:51:42,021
正在秘密恢复其化学武器计划
its chemical weapons program.

738
00:51:42,204 --> 00:51:44,424
国防部长拒绝就空袭发表评论
The secretary of defense declined
to comment on the attack,

739
00:51:44,607 --> 00:51:46,532
只是说此次任务圆满完成
saying only that the mission
was successful,

740
00:51:46,709 --> 00:51:49,760
目标达到，所有参加行动的美国人员
targets acquired, that all American
personnel involved here

741
00:51:49,945 --> 00:51:53,406
- 都已安全返回
- 罢工的公交工人...
- were home safe and sound.
- Striking transportation workers...

742
00:51:54,583 --> 00:51:59,011
对于在那儿发生的事，我所梦到的
My dreams seem more real to me

743
00:51:59,188 --> 00:52:02,614
比我记忆中的更真实，就好像...
than what I actually remember
happening over there. It's like...

744
00:52:04,827 --> 00:52:10,290
就好像在什么地方我被洗过脑，而且...
It's like somewhere along the line
I got brainwashed or something and...

745
00:52:12,635 --> 00:52:15,424
我的脑子好像乱成一团了
I'm just, like, all scrambled up.

746
00:52:16,572 --> 00:52:18,622
我们都被洗过脑，马高
We have all been
brainwashed, Marco.

747
00:52:19,808 --> 00:52:23,201
至于说有人把电子探针
As for somebody
imbedding electric probes

748
00:52:23,378 --> 00:52:27,966
和电脑芯片植入你的大脑
让你惟命是从
and computer chips in your brain
to make you do things,

749
00:52:28,183 --> 00:52:30,040
那纯属无稽之谈，伙计
it's horseshit, man.

750
00:52:32,754 --> 00:52:34,213
稍微给点电击...
A little electroshock...

751
00:52:35,123 --> 00:52:38,710
...再加上睡眠剥夺就可以达到同样的效果
代价却小得多
...and sleep deprivation will do
the trick for a fraction of the price.

752
00:52:38,893 --> 00:52:40,910
你可以去问乌兹别克人
Ask the Uzbeks.

753
00:52:42,096 --> 00:52:44,090
那我的那些梦呢？
What about my dreams?

754
00:52:45,366 --> 00:52:48,623
假如现在这一切都只是你的梦...
What if all this is your dream...

755
00:52:49,704 --> 00:52:52,665
...而你实际上仍身在科威特呢？
...and you are really
still back in Kuwait?

756
00:53:16,564 --> 00:53:19,753
- 谢谢你们，谢谢
- 议员
- Thanks for coming out. Thank you.
- Congressman!

757
00:53:19,934 --> 00:53:21,518
- 议员！
- 议员！
- Congressman!
- Congressman!

758
00:53:21,703 --> 00:53:24,391
议员！议员！
为什么你和阿瑟州长
Congressman! Congressman!
Why do you and Governor Arthur

759
00:53:24,572 --> 00:53:26,395
反对调遣军队进驻印尼？
oppose deploying troops
into lndonesia?

760
00:53:26,608 --> 00:53:28,067
哦，阿瑟州长和我认为
Well, Governor Arthur and I believe

761
00:53:28,243 --> 00:53:29,998
我们不能用卑鄙的手段清理世界
we can't clean up the world
with dirty hands.

762
00:53:30,178 --> 00:53:31,865
肖中士!
Sergeant Shaw!

763
00:53:33,581 --> 00:53:35,336
你有没有梦到过科威特?
Do you ever dream about Kuwait?

764
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:37,473
马高上尉
Captain Marco.

765
00:53:39,354 --> 00:53:41,143
没关系，没关系
It's okay. It's okay.

766
00:53:41,322 --> 00:53:42,838
很高兴见到你，先生
Nice to see you, sir.

767
00:53:43,057 --> 00:53:45,483
晚上好，我也很高兴见到你
Good evening.
It's good to see you too.

768
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,253
为什么向我问起科威特？
Why did you ask me about Kuwait?

769
00:53:47,428 --> 00:53:48,944
我没问你那个，我是问你的梦
I didn't.
I asked you about your dreams.

770
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:50,453
- 谢谢，丽莉
- 肖议员，很抱歉
- Thank you, Lily.
- Congressman Shaw, I'm sorry.

771
00:53:50,632 --> 00:53:53,024
他们想知道你能否在6点
接受拉里・金的采访？
They wanna know if you can do
an interview with Larry King at 6?

772
00:53:53,201 --> 00:53:54,785
- 不，不
- 不接受采访还是6点不行？
- No, no.
- No to the interview or no to 6?

773
00:53:54,969 --> 00:53:56,485
不，他又想谈关于我母亲的事，不行
No. He wants to talk
about my mother. No.

774
00:53:56,671 --> 00:53:58,528
- 一切正常吗， P.J.？
- 你好，先生
- Everything under control, P.J.?
- Hello, sir.

775
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:00,461
见到你很高兴
Good to see you.

776
00:54:00,675 --> 00:54:02,669
那么，上尉，我能为你做些什么？
So, captain, what can I do for you?

777
00:54:02,844 --> 00:54:04,303
我只耽误你几分钟
I just need a few minutes
of your time.

778
00:54:04,479 --> 00:54:05,767
肖议员，能否打扰一下？
Congressman Shaw,
a moment, please?

779
00:54:05,947 --> 00:54:06,940
私人时间
Private time.

780
00:54:07,115 --> 00:54:09,837
不幸的是，这就是我所谓的私人时间了
Unfortunately, this is as private
as it gets for me now.

781
00:54:10,018 --> 00:54:11,568
- 我了解
- 他没问题的，威尔
- I understand.
- He's all right, Will.

782
00:54:11,753 --> 00:54:13,804
- 进来吧
- 谢谢，谢谢
- Come on in.
- Thank you, thank you.

783
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:18,012
- 嘿，乔治
- 那些梦
- Hey, George.
- There are these dreams

784
00:54:18,192 --> 00:54:20,982
我们小分队的一些人一直都在做这些梦
that some of the men
from our unit have been having.

785
00:54:21,161 --> 00:54:22,519
包括你？
Including you?

786
00:54:22,696 --> 00:54:24,020
嗯...
Well...

787
00:54:24,598 --> 00:54:27,685
...实际上事关那天晚上
...it's more of a question
of what actually happened

788
00:54:27,868 --> 00:54:29,920
我们遭到袭击后究竟发生了什么事
the night that our patrol
got attacked.

789
00:54:30,437 --> 00:54:34,730
很简单，我们在伊拉克
控制地区执行例行侦察
That's easy. We're on a routine recon
inside lraqi-controlled terrain.

790
00:54:34,908 --> 00:54:37,563
巡逻队遭遇伏击，敌方
敌方使用了火榴弹, 迫击炮
The patrol is ambushed.
RPG incoming, mortar fire.

791
00:54:37,744 --> 00:54:40,001
- 你被击中--
- 失去了知觉，这和我记得的完全--
- You're knocked--
- Unconscious. Exactly the way--

792
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:43,142
不是要打断你，我是说这和
我记忆中的完全一样
Not to cut you off, but I mean,
exactly the way that I remember it.

793
00:54:43,317 --> 00:54:46,177
但我梦到的却不是这样
But I dreamed something else.

794
00:54:47,754 --> 00:54:49,271
你的梦中有我吗，上尉？
Am I in your dreams, captain?

795
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:51,809
是的，有你，议员
Yes, you are, congressman.

796
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:53,278
救了所有人？
Saving everybody?

797
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:56,479
不是那么简单
瞧，迈尔文下士
It's a whole lot more complicated
than that. Now, Corporal Melvin,

798
00:54:56,663 --> 00:54:59,158
他画下，写下了他梦见了什么
he's been drawing these pictures
and he wrote down what he dreams.

799
00:54:59,333 --> 00:55:01,294
- 如果你刚好--
- 我没有做什么梦，上尉
- Maybe if you just--
- I don't have dreams, captain.

800
00:55:02,202 --> 00:55:05,130
从来没有？你一点梦都不做？
每个人都会做梦的，不是吗？我是说--
At all? You don't dream at all?
Everybody dreams, right? I mean--

801
00:55:05,305 --> 00:55:07,664
听着，上尉，我很想帮助你
我想，我真的很想
Look, captain, I'd like to help you,
I would, I really would,

802
00:55:07,841 --> 00:55:09,665
但我觉得你应该去见见
but I think you ought to
see somebody.

803
00:55:09,843 --> 00:55:11,929
- 那些专门的--
- 我看过医生了
- Somebody who specializes in--
- I've been to doctors.

804
00:55:12,412 --> 00:55:14,031
哦，好，那就好
Well, good, that's very good,

805
00:55:14,214 --> 00:55:16,801
因为他们比我更能帮助你
because they can probably
help you out a lot more than I can.

806
00:55:17,017 --> 00:55:18,671
- 我不知道，但是--
- 保重，上尉
- I don't know, but--
- Take care, captain.

807
00:55:18,852 --> 00:55:21,473
- 嗯，嗯，好
- 谢谢你来拜访
- Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
- Thanks for coming by.

808
00:55:27,928 --> 00:55:29,684
我没疯，肖
I'm not crazy, Shaw.

809
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,451
少校
Major.

810
00:55:37,638 --> 00:55:41,533
- 本，你饿了么？
- 饿极了
- Ben. Are you hungry?
- Starving.

811
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:48,606
嗯，那取决于人口统计
Well, it depends on the demographic.

812
00:55:48,815 --> 00:55:50,139
对不起
Excuse me.

813
00:55:51,618 --> 00:55:53,579
- 我杀了贝克？
- 嗯，那只是个梦
- I killed Baker?
- Well, it's a dream.

814
00:55:53,754 --> 00:55:55,908
我是说，也可能另有含义
I mean, it could mean
something else.

815
00:55:56,356 --> 00:55:58,715
比如可能我凭空想出来的
It could mean I'm supposed
to think you did.

816
00:55:58,892 --> 00:56:02,787
不，我杀的是敌人
我也不认识他们，所以...
No, I killed the enemy.
I didn't know them either, so...

817
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:04,818
...这没什么
...没关系
...it was okay.

818
00:56:05,532 --> 00:56:08,494
不管怎样，我记得我们在科威特做了什么
我十分清楚的记得
And anyway, I remember what we did
in Kuwait. I remember it perfectly.

819
00:56:08,669 --> 00:56:09,924
只是...
I just...

820
00:56:10,404 --> 00:56:12,865
...不记得真的做过与否
...don't remember actually doing it.

821
00:56:13,607 --> 00:56:15,295
也许你根本没做过
Maybe you didn't do it.

822
00:56:22,281 --> 00:56:23,799
不
No.

823
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:26,370
这真荒谬
What a thought.

824
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:45,931
什么？
What?

825
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:52,797
生活很奇怪，不是么？
Life is so bizarre, isn't it?

826
00:56:53,813 --> 00:56:55,433
什么地方奇怪？
Which part?

827
00:56:55,614 --> 00:56:58,110
我不知道
你在楼下看见了什么
I don't know.
What you saw downstairs.

828
00:56:58,551 --> 00:57:04,518
这次竞选，政治，我的公共生活和角色
This campaign. Politics.
My whole public life and persona.

829
00:57:06,025 --> 00:57:09,853
我是说，摆姿势，陪笑脸
像个该死的木偶
I mean, posing and grinning
like a goddamn sock puppet,

830
00:57:10,029 --> 00:57:12,719
和那些完全陌生的人握手
shaking hands with total strangers
who must be completely blind

831
00:57:12,898 --> 00:57:15,326
他们如果不能一眼把我看穿
就一定是瞎子
if they can't see
what I am at the core.

832
00:57:15,501 --> 00:57:18,464
看不到我妈妈一手造就的我
又一个普兰蒂斯家族的人
What my mother has made me.
A Prentiss.

833
00:57:18,637 --> 00:57:20,929
一个讨厌的普兰蒂斯
Ferociously a Prentiss.

834
00:57:21,474 --> 00:57:23,270
- 但不是肖。不，先生
- 我明白
- But not a Shaw. No, sir.
- I see.

835
00:57:23,242 --> 00:57:24,828
- 但不是肖。不，先生
- 我明白
- But not a Shaw. No, sir.
- I see.

836
00:57:25,344 --> 00:57:26,930
不，你没明白
No, you don't.

837
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,102
你也没办法明白
You can't.

838
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:33,546
我20岁前都没有朋友
I was 20 years old
before I had a friend.

839
00:57:33,719 --> 00:57:39,743
更糟的是，第一个朋友是个女朋友
哦，你知道，在我看来算是女朋友
Worse, a girlfriend. Well, you know,
from my point of view, anyway.

840
00:57:40,092 --> 00:57:44,022
一个不在我妈妈允许接触范围之内的朋友
A friend outside of my mother's circle
of approved encounters

841
00:57:44,196 --> 00:57:46,351
而她...
and she...

842
00:57:48,701 --> 00:57:50,424
...我母亲...
...my mother...

843
00:57:53,472 --> 00:57:57,960
只有上帝才知道她对乔斯林说了什么
把她赶走了
God only knows what she told
Jocelyn to chase her away.

844
00:57:58,477 --> 00:58:01,133
这激发了我平生唯一的反抗行动：
Precipitating my sole act
of rebellion:

845
00:58:01,313 --> 00:58:03,172
狂怒之下...
Storming off...

846
00:58:03,949 --> 00:58:06,468
...我入伍参了军
...and enlisting in the Army.

847
00:58:09,855 --> 00:58:11,316
但是战争之后...
But after the war...

848
00:58:13,292 --> 00:58:15,515
...我又回到她身边
...I came back to her.

849
00:58:17,163 --> 00:58:19,386
你为什么回来？
发生了什么？
Why did you come back?
What happened?

850
00:58:23,968 --> 00:58:25,794
难道你没在听么？
Weren't you listening?

851
00:58:26,471 --> 00:58:28,468
我母亲的作用
Mother happened.

852
00:58:29,641 --> 00:58:31,900
你知道，实际上我非常痛恨这件事
You know, the truth is I hate it.

853
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:34,637
我也总是厌恶那枚勋章
I've always despised the Medal.

854
00:58:35,213 --> 00:58:38,609
那些小人令人作呕的阿谀奉承
The cloying adulation
of the little people.

855
00:58:39,584 --> 00:58:41,911
很显然...
It's certainly...

856
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,743
...我没什么值得你嫉妒的，少校
...nothing for you
to be jealous of, major.

857
00:58:44,923 --> 00:58:46,317
我不是嫉妒
I'm not jealous.

858
00:58:47,258 --> 00:58:49,084
我没有那些梦，本
I don't have the dreams, Ben.

859
00:58:49,527 --> 00:58:53,925
你怎么会不记着救过
我们整个小分队呢？
How could you not remember
saving our unit?

860
00:58:54,465 --> 00:58:55,927
我记得，我说了我救过
I do. I said I did.

861
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:59,690
不，不，你没说过
你说你不记得真的做过与否
No, no, you didn't. You said
that you didn't remember doing it.

862
00:58:59,871 --> 00:59:02,232
那是你几分钟以前说的话
That's what you just said
a couple minutes ago.

863
00:59:03,942 --> 00:59:06,166
每当我回想起那个夜晚...
When I think about that night...

864
00:59:07,745 --> 00:59:10,436
...就好象我事先知道将要发生什么
...it's as if I know what will happen.

865
00:59:11,649 --> 00:59:13,373
问题是，我从来就没感觉到过
The thing is, I never seem
to get to the point

866
00:59:13,551 --> 00:59:16,811
那是实实在在发生过的事情
where I feel that it actually
does happen.

867
00:59:16,988 --> 00:59:18,848
但我相信那是非常正常的
But I'm sure that's perfectly normal.

868
00:59:19,123 --> 00:59:22,747
好吧，那你和其他人谈过这些么？
这些自相矛盾的事？
Okay. Well, have you discussed this
with anyone? These discrepancies?

869
00:59:23,094 --> 00:59:25,318
我能和谁说呢？
Who would I share that with?

870
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:28,425
我的老战友们喜欢我爱戴我
My old Army buddies
who love and adore me

871
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,756
因为我救过他们那些不值钱的小命
for saving their
pathetically unimportant,

872
00:59:30,935 --> 00:59:33,432
难道找我周围的那些浑蛋？
present company excluded, asses?

873
00:59:33,872 --> 00:59:35,960
你可以和军队的情报部门谈谈
You could discuss it
with Army intelligence.

874
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:39,570
你可以去那儿，我可以陪你一起去
You could go down there.
I mean, I could go with you

875
00:59:39,744 --> 00:59:41,968
谈一下这件事，告诉他们你所记得的
and discuss it and you can tell them
what you remember,

876
00:59:42,146 --> 00:59:45,144
和你记不起来的，他们会...
what you don't remember,
and they could...

877
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:47,642
...做一些测试
...run some tests.

878
00:59:50,355 --> 00:59:52,784
是的，测试，哦
Yeah, tests. Boy.

879
00:59:52,991 --> 00:59:55,011
新闻界就会有事情做了
The press would have
a field day with that.

880
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:58,385
有人在我的身体里植入了一个装置
我今天早上发现的
Somebody put an implant inside me.
I found it this morning.

881
00:59:58,563 --> 01:00:00,822
我背上还有个洞
你要看我可以给你看看
I've got the hole in my back
if you wanna take a look at it.

882
01:00:00,999 --> 01:00:03,588
而且我觉得他们很有可能
在你身上也放了一个
And I got a good feeling
they put one in you too.

883
01:00:09,607 --> 01:00:11,297
没有人在我身体里放任何东西，本
Nobody has put anything
in me, Ben.

884
01:00:11,476 --> 01:00:13,632
让我来证明给你看
为什么不，你知道的...
Let's prove it.
Why don't, you know...

885
01:00:13,811 --> 01:00:15,432
- 我们去做个X光检查...
- 听着，本
- We'll go get an x-ray...
- Look, Ben,

886
01:00:15,613 --> 01:00:17,439
我想支持你，真的
I wanna be supportive of you. I do.

887
01:00:17,615 --> 01:00:20,238
但是你不觉得应该把这个放到选举之后么？
But don't you think this could wait
till after the election?

888
01:00:20,418 --> 01:00:21,607
为什么？因为什么？
Why? For what?

889
01:00:21,786 --> 01:00:23,874
- 你害怕什么？
- 我不怕任何事
- What are you scared of?
- I'm not afraid of anything.

890
01:00:24,055 --> 01:00:26,848
- 那么我们为什么不证明一下--
- 知道么？我想你应该走了
- Then why don't we just prove it--
- Know what? I think you should leave.

891
01:00:27,024 --> 01:00:29,614
- 对不起，我真的--
- 听着
- I'm sorry, I really--
- Listen.

892
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:34,624
有人用钢针,切割器和锯子
Somebody got into our heads
with big steel-toe boots,

893
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:37,296
打开我们的脑袋，为所欲为
cable cutters and a chainsaw
and they went to town.

894
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:40,955
剥离出脑细胞，将神经回路重新搭接
Neurons got-- Got--
Got exposed and circuits got rewired.

895
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:43,898
我们的脑细胞被清除了，雷蒙德
Our brain cells got
obliterated, Raymond.

896
01:00:44,074 --> 01:00:45,662
求你了
Please.

897
01:00:46,543 --> 01:00:48,541
你需要帮助，本
You need to get help, Ben.

898
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:51,573
你要干什么？本！
What are you doing? Ben!

899
01:00:55,786 --> 01:00:57,511
住手！住手！
Stop! Stop!

900
01:00:57,788 --> 01:00:59,012
房间里面！房间里面！
Inside! Inside!

901
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:06,014
议员！
Congressman!

902
01:01:11,868 --> 01:01:13,695
他咬了他，他咬了他
He bit him. He bit him.

903
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:19,832
把他从这弄出去
Get him out of here.

904
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,139
你还好吧，先生？
Are you okay, sir?

905
01:01:31,722 --> 01:01:33,185
- 都给我出去
- 先生，我们应该--
- Leave me alone.
- Sir, we should--

906
01:01:33,357 --> 01:01:34,945
出去！
Get out!

907
01:02:09,192 --> 01:02:10,951
我们是从波托马克河把他捞上来的
We fished him out of
the Potomac River

908
01:02:11,128 --> 01:02:14,059
大概在昨天下午4：45
about 4:45 yesterday afternoon.

909
01:02:15,132 --> 01:02:18,029
你去艾尔・迈尔文的公寓干什么？
What were you doing
in Al Melvin's apartment?

910
01:02:19,169 --> 01:02:20,723
我去和他谈谈，他不在家
I went to talk to him.
He wasn't home.

911
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:23,926
谈什么？那些梦？
Talk about what? Dreams?

912
01:02:26,842 --> 01:02:28,363
有趣的东西
Interesting stuff.

913
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:31,601
是啊，他家里有几百件那样的东西
Yeah, there's hundreds
of those in his place.

914
01:02:31,781 --> 01:02:33,074
你应该让你的人去查一下
You should have your people
check it out.

915
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:34,747
哦，我们马上就派人去
Oh, we'll get on that right away.

916
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:38,281
盖瑞特上校非常通容的
给我们看了你的档案，马高
Colonel Garret was kind enough
to show us the file on you, Marco.

917
01:02:38,454 --> 01:02:41,784
你可真了不起，不是么？
You are the real deal, aren't you?

918
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:46,082
特种部队，突击队，三角洲部队
Special Forces. Rangers. Delta.

919
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:49,858
我想和迈尔文下士谈谈
I wanted to talk to Corporal Melvin

920
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:53,931
问他关于91年科威特那次侦察中...
to ask him some
unanswered questions about...

921
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:56,796
...我的一些疑问
...our reconnaissance
in Kuwait back in '91.

922
01:02:56,972 --> 01:02:58,868
- 他不在家
- 是的，不在
- He wasn't home.
- Right. He wasn't there.

923
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:02,599
所以，你觉得可以破门而入进去等他？
So, what, you thought it was okay
to just break in and wait for him?

924
01:03:02,778 --> 01:03:04,276
如果你们在暗示我杀了他
我可以告诉你们没有
I didn't kill him,
if that's where you're headed.

925
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,139
没人说你杀了他
Nobody said you did.

926
01:03:06,315 --> 01:03:07,836
可能他是自杀的
Maybe he committed suicide.

927
01:03:09,885 --> 01:03:11,713
你为什么缠上了雷蒙德・肖？
What's your obsession
with Raymond Shaw?

928
01:03:11,887 --> 01:03:13,476
我没有缠上他
I'm not obsessed
with Raymond Shaw.

929
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:15,348
他的梦中情人
The man of his dreams.

930
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:18,687
你也许可以让你们的法医
You may want to ask
your medical examiners

931
01:03:18,861 --> 01:03:20,757
检查一下迈尔文的后背
to check Melvin's back.

932
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:22,622
在肩胛骨附近的皮肤下面
It's under the skin
just shy of the scapula.

933
01:03:22,798 --> 01:03:25,662
你们会发现一个植入物
They may find a implant.

934
01:03:25,835 --> 01:03:27,527
就在皮肤下面，左肩
Just under the skin, left side.

935
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:29,964
如果他们不仔细找，是找不到的
If they don't look real hard,
they won't find it.

936
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,836
他们在找的时候也可以象这样唱歌
They could sing that while
they're looking for it if they like.

937
01:03:33,008 --> 01:03:34,904
- 植入物
- 是的
- lmplants.
- That's what I said.

938
01:03:35,077 --> 01:03:36,769
植-入-物
I-M-plant.

939
01:03:36,946 --> 01:03:41,676
是的，但是从你的档案上看
Yeah, but judging from
your file here, apparently,

940
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:44,316
你似乎对自己的情况是一无所知，朋友
you don't know your shit
from your oatmeal, my friend.

941
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,145
对不起，没有必要
Excuse me. This is unnecessary.

942
01:03:46,856 --> 01:03:48,354
你有毛病吗？
You got a problem?

943
01:03:49,425 --> 01:03:52,721
心理上的？你看起来有点生气了
Psycho? You look a little angry.

944
01:03:53,896 --> 01:03:56,691
也许你想揍我？
来吧，打啊
Maybe you wanna hit me?
Go ahead, you can do it.

945
01:03:57,833 --> 01:04:00,560
- 嘿！
- 看在上帝的份上，本...
- Hey!
- For God's sake, Ben...

946
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,260
他打我
He hit me.

947
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:06,267
你还想帮他？
And you wanna help him?

948
01:04:06,442 --> 01:04:10,102
不，那在相等于政治自杀，绝对不行
No. That would be political suicide.
Of course not.

949
01:04:10,579 --> 01:04:12,578
我想让你帮他
I want you to help him.

950
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:18,445
我甚至不能想象为什么
I can't even imagine why.

951
01:04:19,155 --> 01:04:22,349
妈妈，我向你保证我求您这么做
Mother, I can assure you, I am as
uncomfortable asking you to do this

952
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:24,717
正如您一样是万分情愿的
as you are being asked.

953
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:27,652
我的人正在申请对他的限制令
My campaign people are getting
a restraining order against him.

954
01:04:27,829 --> 01:04:31,092
他会上每一个安全监视名单
但是我不会把他关起来
He's going on every security watch list,
but I won't lock him up.

955
01:04:31,266 --> 01:04:33,960
- 我不想起诉他
- 什么？
- I'm not pressing charges.
- What?

956
01:04:34,135 --> 01:04:36,328
我不知道，只是...
I don't know, it's just...

957
01:04:39,874 --> 01:04:41,339
我现在不想谈这个
I don't wanna talk
about this right now.

958
01:04:41,509 --> 01:04:43,338
我们能回到竞选上
把精力集中在这方面么--
Can we get back to the campaign
and focus on something--

959
01:04:43,511 --> 01:04:46,944
雷蒙德，你不会相信他的鬼话吧？
Raymond, you don't actually
believe his story?

960
01:04:48,783 --> 01:04:50,646
不
No.

961
01:04:51,152 --> 01:04:53,243
但是他相信
But he does.

962
01:04:54,789 --> 01:04:57,255
他是个好士兵
And he's a fine soldier.

963
01:04:58,259 --> 01:05:01,021
如果为了使他保持清醒
And if his slim hold
on sanity requires

964
01:05:01,196 --> 01:05:03,696
我必须容忍他的精神错乱直到他得到帮助
我会这样做的
that I tolerate his delusions
until he can get help, I'll do it.

965
01:05:03,865 --> 01:05:05,524
那对我没有伤害
It doesn't diminish me.

966
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:08,066
我不怕他
I'm not afraid of him.

967
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:10,692
雷蒙德
Raymond.

968
01:05:18,346 --> 01:05:21,973
你对你的朋友有多了解？
How much do you actually know
about your friend?

969
01:05:53,414 --> 01:05:55,380
哦，真是可怜
Oh, that's sad.

970
01:05:55,550 --> 01:05:57,482
可怜的小兵
Poor little tin soldier.

971
01:05:57,652 --> 01:05:59,379
妈妈，求你了
Mother, please.

972
01:05:59,554 --> 01:06:02,180
你只要想想马高少校
昨天在竞选总部出现的时候
Well, just imagine how terrified
your people were yesterday

973
01:06:02,357 --> 01:06:04,721
你的人有多惊慌
when Major Marco showed up
at campaign headquarters

974
01:06:04,892 --> 01:06:06,516
你还邀请他--
and you invite--

975
01:06:06,694 --> 01:06:08,819
上帝，你还邀请他进来
My God, you invited him in.

976
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:10,929
他们还对他的情况都了若指掌
With all they know about him.

977
01:06:11,899 --> 01:06:13,865
我了解他
I know him.

978
01:06:14,435 --> 01:06:16,435
我在他手下当兵，他是个好人
I served under him.
He was a good man.

979
01:06:16,604 --> 01:06:19,833
是啊，连环杀手的邻居也都这样说他们
Well, that's what the neighbors
always say about serial killers.

980
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:31,615
你可以走了，肖没有起诉你
You're out of here.
Shaw won't press charges.

981
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:37,785
有人从埃莉诺・肖参议员的办公室打电话
Someone from
Senator Eleanor Shaw's office called

982
01:06:37,991 --> 01:06:40,153
为你开脱
and intervened on your behalf.

983
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:42,921
少校，你已经达到了
军方所能容忍的底线
Major, you've reached the terminal end
of the Army's patience.

984
01:06:43,130 --> 01:06:45,759
你已经被免职，立即生效
You're relieved of duty,
effective immediately.

985
01:06:48,035 --> 01:06:49,765
是，长官
Yes, sir.

986
01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:51,302
本
Ben,

987
01:06:51,505 --> 01:06:54,737
在沃尔特・里德有一个年轻的神经科医师
名叫扎恩
there is a young neurologist
at Walter Reed. His name is Zahn.

988
01:06:54,941 --> 01:06:57,206
他在海湾战争综合症方面很有研究
He's had real success
with Gulf War Syndrome.

989
01:06:57,411 --> 01:06:59,346
你要整理好你的材料
You are instructed to get
your affairs in order

990
01:06:59,546 --> 01:07:01,606
周一一大早就到他那去报道
and report to him
first thing Monday morning.

991
01:07:27,808 --> 01:07:29,572
我记着你说你把它弄丢了
I thought you said you lost it.

992
01:07:29,776 --> 01:07:31,335
我咬了一个家伙，又找到了一个
I bit a guy. I found another one.

993
01:07:34,114 --> 01:07:36,982
这些应该是不存在的啊
These are not supposed to exist.

994
01:07:44,191 --> 01:07:46,683
这只是在理论上存在的
These are only theoretical.

995
01:07:51,798 --> 01:07:53,323
它是干什么用的？
So, what does it do?

996
01:07:53,533 --> 01:07:55,866
- 我不知道
- 你不知道？
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

997
01:07:57,971 --> 01:07:59,735
我不知道
I don't know.

998
01:08:02,075 --> 01:08:05,102
我不想知道，你也不会想知道
I don't wanna know.
You don't wanna know.

999
01:08:05,312 --> 01:08:08,043
你看，它从你的身体里出来
而你还活着
Look, it's out of you
and you are still alive.

1000
01:08:08,248 --> 01:08:10,376
那就是好消息
That's the good news.

1001
01:08:10,884 --> 01:08:12,409
那坏消息是什么？
What's the bad news?

1002
01:08:14,755 --> 01:08:16,849
可能他们知道你在这
Maybe they know you're here.

1003
01:08:35,675 --> 01:08:38,804
你说的那些军用植入物
You said the Army implants,
they were for

1004
01:08:39,012 --> 01:08:41,413
它们是用于存放急救资料的，对吧？
emergency medical data, right?

1005
01:08:41,615 --> 01:08:44,312
他们确实是这样宣称的
The ones they publicized were.

1006
01:08:45,051 --> 01:08:50,319
曾经同时还进行着另一项计划,
研究各种可怕的植入体
There was a parallel project
for all kinds of scary implantables.

1007
01:08:50,524 --> 01:08:54,052
克林顿的特工们最终怕了这东西
计划就中止了
The Clinton watchdogs finally
freaked out about it, closed down.

1008
01:08:54,261 --> 01:08:56,355
另一项计划？
Parallel project?

1009
01:08:56,563 --> 01:08:57,792
你是怎么知道的？
How did you know about that?

1010
01:08:57,998 --> 01:09:02,800
满洲国际集团曾经资助我
制作那些可怕的玩意儿
Manchurian Global funded me
to make some of their scary shit.

1011
01:09:03,003 --> 01:09:04,733
听说过他们么？
Heard of them?

1012
01:09:05,605 --> 01:09:07,801
想象一下，那不只是一个公司，马高
Imagine not just
a corporation, Marco,

1013
01:09:08,008 --> 01:09:11,638
而是一个该死的政体附属物
but a goddamn geopolitical
extension of policy

1014
01:09:11,845 --> 01:09:14,076
从尼克松党政时就开始了
for every president since Nixon.

1015
01:09:14,281 --> 01:09:16,011
金钱就是上帝，马高
Cash is king, Marco.

1016
01:09:16,216 --> 01:09:18,276
金钱就是上帝
Cash is king.

1017
01:09:29,763 --> 01:09:31,891
你确定你非要这么做么？
You sure you wanna do this?

1018
01:09:32,098 --> 01:09:33,828
当然
Absolutely.

1019
01:09:36,069 --> 01:09:37,799
因为我不想
Because I don't.

1020
01:09:38,004 --> 01:09:39,336
我欠你一个人情
I'll owe you one.

1021
01:09:39,539 --> 01:09:41,269
不
No.

1022
01:09:41,475 --> 01:09:43,273
我还欠着你的人情
I still owe you.

1023
01:09:44,377 --> 01:09:46,676
因为你把我从阿尔巴尼亚弄出来
For getting me out of Albania.

1024
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:48,178
阿尔巴尼亚

阿特金斯自杀身亡
Atkins committed suicide.

1158
01:22:16,362 --> 01:22:19,389
詹姆森在911事件中死于五角大楼
Jameson died 9/1 1, Pentagon.

1159
01:22:21,701 --> 01:22:23,135
- 本？
- 什么事？
- Ben?
- Yeah?

1160
01:22:23,336 --> 01:22:25,464
- 他叫什么？
- 谁？
- Did he have a name?
- Who?

1161
01:22:25,671 --> 01:22:28,300
做这件事的人，本
The person that did this, Ben.

1162
01:22:28,507 --> 01:22:31,341
他叫什么名字？你还记得么？
What was his name?
Can you remember?

1163
01:22:32,979 --> 01:22:34,242
本
Ben.

1164
01:22:34,447 --> 01:22:36,245
- 什么事？
- 他叫什么名字？
- Yeah?
- Did he have a name?

1165
01:23:38,511 --> 01:23:41,106
只要看一看过去十年内
You only have to look
at the enormous strides made

1166
01:23:41,314 --> 01:23:43,476
在纯种番茄的基因重组上
in the last decade
with the genetic reconfiguration

1167
01:23:43,683 --> 01:23:45,777
我们所取得的巨大进步
of the noble tomato.

1168
01:23:45,985 --> 01:23:48,784
事实是番茄在生长过程中过分成熟
What was happening was the tomato
was over-ripening in the process

1169
01:23:48,988 --> 01:23:50,786
而失去了它原有的口味
and it was losing its flavor.

1170
01:23:50,990 --> 01:23:54,552
实际使那些相关基因失去活性
是一个很简单的过程
It's actually a very simple procedure
to deactivate the gene concerned.

1171
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:58,128
这种方法也能用于我们自身
And the same thing
can be applied to ourselves.

1172
01:23:58,331 --> 01:23:59,356
只要轻轻拨弄一下开关
At a flick of a switch,

1173
01:23:59,565 --> 01:24:02,433
我们就可以调整特性
we can adjust character,

1174
01:24:02,635 --> 01:24:04,331
改变个性
change personality.

1175
01:24:04,537 --> 01:24:07,063
当然，更重要的是...
And of course, more importantly...

1176
01:24:07,940 --> 01:24:11,035
...我们可以通过植入记忆
或者调节神经突触连接
... we can offset
the ravages of dementia

1177
01:24:11,243 --> 01:24:16,204
来修复神经病变引起的创伤
by implanting memory or adjusting
the synaptic connections.

1178
01:24:16,415 --> 01:24:19,852
我们能把人们从可怕的
精神负担中解脱出来
We can free people
from the terrible burden

1179
01:24:20,052 --> 01:24:22,385
帮他们忘记过去痛苦的经历
of an emotionally
compromised past.

1180
01:24:26,659 --> 01:24:28,059
- 看着点路！
- 对不起
- Watch where you're going!
- Sorry.

1181
01:24:28,260 --> 01:24:29,353
看着点路！
Watch where you're going!

1182
01:24:29,562 --> 01:24:31,497
退后！退后
Just back up! Just back up.

1183
01:24:31,697 --> 01:24:34,929
看着点，看着点，闭嘴
Watch it. Watch it. Shut up.

1184
01:24:36,769 --> 01:24:38,567
放松点，先生
Take it easy, sir.

1185
01:24:43,209 --> 01:24:46,338
我给五角大楼打了电话
他们说他在保外就医
I called the Pentagon and they told me
he's on medical leave.

1186
01:24:46,545 --> 01:24:50,448
特工部门已经把他列进一系列监视名单中
Secret Service, they got him on a
couple of their watch and observe lists.

1187
01:24:52,351 --> 01:24:54,047
我想这个人跟肖议员之间
I guess there's been some trouble
with this guy

1188
01:24:54,253 --> 01:24:56,051
一定有什么过节
involving Congressman Shaw.

1189
01:24:57,256 --> 01:24:58,622
哦？
Oh?

1190
01:25:01,594 --> 01:25:05,156
在满洲国际集团的股东中
Among the shareholders
in Manchurian Global,

1191
01:25:05,364 --> 01:25:07,492
如果他们真要发布一个名单的话
当然他们是不会的
were they to ever publish a list,
which they won't,

1192
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:11,034
你会发现里面有前任总统
被废黜的君王
you would find former presidents,
deposed kings,

1193
01:25:11,237 --> 01:25:13,729
信托基金恐怖分子
倒台的共产主义独裁者
trust fund terrorists,
fallen Communist dictators,

1194
01:25:13,939 --> 01:25:17,535
什叶派穆斯林权威，非洲军阀
还有退休的首相
ayatollahs, African warlords
and retired prime ministers.

1195
01:25:17,743 --> 01:25:19,837
- 明白我的意思吗？
- 我明白，他们很强大，非常强大
- See what I mean?
- I get it. They're big. They're huge.

1196
01:25:20,045 --> 01:25:21,479
他们...他们...
简直势力巨大无比
They're... They're...
They're gigantic.

1197
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:23,546
我没能力去碰他们，我知道了
我也不想碰
I can't touch them. I get it.
I don't want to.

1198
01:25:24,383 --> 01:25:25,851
你给我带来的只是些谣言和猜想
And you bring me rumors
and conjecture.

1199
01:25:26,051 --> 01:25:27,952
我刚开始只是做恶梦
谣言和猜想
I started with nightmares.
Rumors, conjectures,

1200
01:25:28,154 --> 01:25:29,645
那对我来说已经是个巨大的进步
that's a giant leap forward.

1201
01:25:30,122 --> 01:25:33,149
这些就是你用来解释你恶梦的主要资料:
Nightmares that you've interpreted
using as primary resources

1202
01:25:33,359 --> 01:25:34,520
一，你零星的记忆
A, your spotty memory,

1203
01:25:34,727 --> 01:25:36,423
二，互联网
B, the lnternet,

1204
01:25:36,629 --> 01:25:40,066
白痴和疯子的神圣庇护所
他们就是这么来看互联网的
sacred sanctuary of idiots and nutters.
That's how they're gonna look at this.

1205
01:25:40,266 --> 01:25:42,735
还有三，一个疯子的笔记
And C, a crazy man's notebook,

1206
01:25:42,935 --> 01:25:44,801
加上你从一个男人后背上
咬下来的证据
along with evidence you chewed
out of a man's back.

1207
01:25:45,004 --> 01:25:47,132
这些都可以被同一根线索
完美地串联起来
All neatly stitched together
with a common thread

1208
01:25:47,339 --> 01:25:51,436
一个非常有权势，有着强大的
关系网的私人基金会
of a supremely powerful,
well-connected private equity fund,

1209
01:25:51,644 --> 01:25:53,340
无论是谁，如果曾经接近过他们
who, if you ever get
anywhere near them,

1210
01:25:53,546 --> 01:25:55,105
都会声称自己对他们一无所知
并且心有余悸
will plead ignorance
and be shocked.

1211
01:25:55,314 --> 01:25:56,407
余悸犹在地获悉
Shocked to learn

1212
01:25:56,615 --> 01:25:59,141
该集团一些合作伙伴所在从事的勾当
what some of their subsidiary
partners are engaged in.

1213
01:25:59,351 --> 01:26:01,343
我才不在乎什么满洲国际集团, 先生
I could give a rat's ass
about Manchurian Global, sir.

1214
01:26:01,554 --> 01:26:03,113
我一点也不在乎他们
I could give a rat's ass about them.

1215
01:26:03,689 --> 01:26:05,681
那不是我来这的原因
That is not why I'm here.

1216
01:26:09,862 --> 01:26:11,888
我也查过你的资料，参议员
I looked you up too, senator.

1217
01:26:14,033 --> 01:26:15,695
哦？
Oh?

1218
01:26:16,735 --> 01:26:18,533
你曾经当过兵
You were in the Army.

1219
01:26:18,737 --> 01:26:19,932
我是被征召入伍的
I was drafted.

1220
01:26:20,139 --> 01:26:22,870
恐怕不能算个好士兵，让我看看
Didn't make much of a soldier,
I'm afraid. Let me see this.

1221
01:26:23,075 --> 01:26:25,840
那倒跟我在资料中看到的不一样
资料中不是这么说的，先生
That's not what I saw in the record.
That's not what the record says, sir.

1222
01:26:26,045 --> 01:26:28,810
你也知道战争是怎么样的
And you know how it works.

1223
01:26:29,215 --> 01:26:31,548
战争是一场场战斗打下来的
Wars are fought
one battle at a time.

1224
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:34,049
战役是一颗颗子弹赢下来的
Battles, you win one bullet at a time.

1225
01:26:34,253 --> 01:26:36,848
我无须对你讳言
And I'd be lying to you if I said

1226
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:39,025
我来找你很大程度上是因为
that I didn't factor in,
in a huge way,

1227
01:26:39,225 --> 01:26:42,024
你无论从个人，政治
或者爱国的角度出发
the fact that you have
a vested, personal,

1228
01:26:42,228 --> 01:26:44,993
对揭发此事的真相一定会有兴趣
political and patriotic interest
in how all of this shakes out.

1229
01:26:45,197 --> 01:26:47,098
我无须对你讳言
I'd be lying to you.

1230
01:26:49,068 --> 01:26:50,969
你是对的，少校
You're right, major.

1231
01:26:51,604 --> 01:26:53,072
我有兴趣
I do.

1232
01:26:53,873 --> 01:26:57,935
昨晚一场招待沃臣公司执行总裁的
高级晚宴因受到抗议者骚扰而无法进行
A $5, 000-a-plate dinner honoring
the CEO of Votron Incorporated,

1233
01:26:58,143 --> 01:27:01,511
沃臣公司是美国第三大的触摸屏生产厂商
the nation's third-largest producer of
the controversial touch-screen units

1234
01:27:01,714 --> 01:27:04,684
其产品因将被用于
即将到来的大选而备受争议
that will be used in the forthcoming
election, was disrupted last night,

1235
01:27:04,884 --> 01:27:07,547
抗议者假扮成服务员和厨师
when protestors disguised as
waiters and kitchen staff

1236
01:27:07,753 --> 01:27:10,621
在高处齐声喊出抗议口号
unleashed a blizzard
of symbolic chants from above,

1237
01:27:10,823 --> 01:27:12,189
引起了短暂的恐慌
resulting in a momentary panic.

1238
01:27:12,391 --> 01:27:15,691
有希望当选总统的现任副总统
埃德华・纳尔逊的支持者
The supporters of presidential hopeful
Vice President Edward Nelson

1239
01:27:15,895 --> 01:27:17,887
纷纷逃往出口或者钻入桌底
fled to exits and dove under tables.

1240
01:27:18,097 --> 01:27:22,194
保安人员迅速制伏了抗议者
其中一人...
Security personnel quickly subdued
the protestors, one of whom...

1241
01:27:23,369 --> 01:27:25,133
那个人有精神病，汤姆
The man is insane, T om.

1242
01:27:25,337 --> 01:27:27,101
典型的精神分裂症
Full-blown schizophrenia.

1243
01:27:27,306 --> 01:27:30,606
他曾经暗算过雷蒙
联邦调查局已经在全力调查此事了
He's been stalking Raymond,
the FBl is all over this already.

1244
01:27:30,809 --> 01:27:32,835
那些文件我也看过
I've seen the files.

1245
01:27:33,512 --> 01:27:35,947
- 你看过么？
- 全力调查什么？
- Have you seen them?
- All over what?

1246
01:27:37,249 --> 01:27:40,344
你的神经战友去找过参议员乔丹
Your bipolar war buddy
has been sharing his dreams

1247
01:27:40,553 --> 01:27:42,215
谈他的梦去了
with Senator Jordan.

1248
01:27:42,821 --> 01:27:43,914
你好，雷蒙德
Hello, Raymond.

1249
01:27:44,623 --> 01:27:47,024
你好，参议员
乔斯林怎么样？
Hello, senator.
How's Jocelyn?

1250
01:27:47,226 --> 01:27:50,355
你找其他人核实过这件事么，汤姆？
Have you fact-checked this
with anyone, Tom?

1251
01:27:50,796 --> 01:27:52,355
雷蒙德
Raymond.

1252
01:27:56,001 --> 01:27:57,993
你认识这个人么？
Do you recognize this man?

1253
01:28:00,072 --> 01:28:01,438
不认识
No.

1254
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:03,734
他叫阿提克斯・诺伊尔
His name is Atticus Noyle.

1255
01:28:04,276 --> 01:28:06,643
是个南非科学家和科技雇佣兵
He's a South African scientist
and mercenary.

1256
01:28:06,845 --> 01:28:09,406
我们的中情局曾利用他
Someone our ClA turned to

1257
01:28:09,615 --> 01:28:12,813
在阿富汗与苏联展开秘密的精神战
for covert mind warfare
against the Soviets in Afghanistan.

1258
01:28:13,018 --> 01:28:16,113
他也曾向恐怖分子和流氓国家
Someone who has sold
his technology and services

1259
01:28:16,322 --> 01:28:19,087
出售他的技术和服务
to terrorists and rogue states.

1260
01:28:19,558 --> 01:28:21,584
他和我又有什么关系？
And what does he
have to do with me?

1261
01:28:22,661 --> 01:28:26,462
班尼特・马高少校声称这个人...
Major Bennett Marco
claims that this man...

1262
01:28:26,799 --> 01:28:27,994
...给你洗过脑
...brainwashed you.

1263
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:29,759
在他的梦里
In his dreams.

1264
01:28:30,502 --> 01:28:32,664
人为的让你赢得了荣誉勋章
Contrived to have you win
the Medal of Honor.

1265
01:28:33,172 --> 01:28:36,700
想把变成第一个受私人拥有和操纵的
And has you poised to be the first
privately owned and operated

1266
01:28:36,909 --> 01:28:38,571
美国副总统
vice president of the United States.

1267
01:28:38,777 --> 01:28:41,178
先生，我已经和本・马高谈过了
Sir, I've already spoken
with Ben Marco.

1268
01:28:41,380 --> 01:28:43,975
不幸的是，他不是一个正常的人
Unfortunately, he's not a well man.

1269
01:28:44,183 --> 01:28:45,515
他精神错乱
He's delusional.

1270
01:28:45,718 --> 01:28:47,346
尽管如此
Nevertheless,

1271
01:28:47,553 --> 01:28:49,954
他还是从他疯狂的脑袋里
he's pulled from his mad hat

1272
01:28:50,155 --> 01:28:52,317
理出了一些非常明晰的线索
some remarkably lucid connections

1273
01:28:52,524 --> 01:28:55,221
将他关于你在科威特的英勇事迹的梦
between his dreams
of your exploits in Kuwait

1274
01:28:55,427 --> 01:28:57,157
和这位诺伊尔医生联系了起来
and this Dr. Noyle

1275
01:28:57,363 --> 01:28:59,628
同时还有私人公平基金会满洲国际集团
and the private equity fund
Manchurian Global,

1276
01:29:00,165 --> 01:29:03,431
你母亲过去15年主要的政治赞助人
your mother's primary political
benefactor for the past 1 5 years.

1277
01:29:03,636 --> 01:29:06,333
哦，得了吧，汤姆
他们赞助了半个参议院的人
Oh, come on, Tom.
They contribute to half the Senate.

1278
01:29:06,538 --> 01:29:08,200
两党的都有
Both sides of the aisle.

1279
01:29:08,407 --> 01:29:09,602
你在说什么？
What are you saying?

1280
01:29:10,309 --> 01:29:14,269
“沙漠风暴”行动期间
阿提卡斯・诺伊尔医生
At the time of Desert Storm,
Dr. Atticus Noyle

1281
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:17,109
受满洲国际集团的科研资助
而在其属下工作

研发深层植入来改变人类行为的技术

哦，上帝
Oh, my God.

1284
01:29:22,121 --> 01:29:24,181
流氓科学家，思维控制
满洲国际集团
Rogue scientists, mind control,
Manchurian Global.

1285
01:29:24,390 --> 01:29:25,380
- 还有你
- 汤姆
- You.
- Tom.

1286
01:29:25,591 --> 01:29:26,991
把这些都联系起来看看，雷蒙德
Connect the dots, Raymond.

1287
01:29:27,192 --> 01:29:30,253
你那个著名的“失踪巡逻队”
Where was your famous
Lost Patrol

1288
01:29:30,462 --> 01:29:32,954
在失踪的三天里面在那儿呢？
for those three missing days?

1289
01:29:33,165 --> 01:29:36,624
是在沙漠里躲避敌人？
还是在别的地方,
Eluding capture in the desert?
Or somewhere else,

1290
01:29:36,835 --> 01:29:39,964
被这位阿提卡斯・诺伊尔医生
拿来当了试验品？
being microwaved
by this Atticus Noyle?

1291
01:29:40,172 --> 01:29:42,505
- 哦，汤姆
- 对不起，参议员
- Oh, Tom.
- I'm sorry, senator,

1292
01:29:42,708 --> 01:29:45,769
你到底想让我做什么呢？
but what exactly
are you suggesting I do?

1293
01:29:46,979 --> 01:29:48,504
体面地退出
Bow out gracefully.

1294
01:29:48,714 --> 01:29:50,307
个人原因，得了某种疾病之类的
Personal reasons,
an obscure illness.

1295
01:29:50,783 --> 01:29:52,911
从竞选舞台上退下来与世隔绝
Yield your spot on the ticket
and go into seclusion.

1296
01:29:53,118 --> 01:29:54,916
哦，原来这就是你的目的
Oh, that's what this is about.

1297
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:57,385
然后向联邦政府自首
And then surrender yourself
to federal authorities.

1298
01:29:57,589 --> 01:29:59,285
帮助他们查到这件事的根源
Help them trace this thing
to its source

1299
01:29:59,491 --> 01:30:02,325
并对这件事对你造成的
任何伤害进行治疗
and address whatever damage
may have been done to you.

1300
01:30:02,528 --> 01:30:05,259
明天一大早
And I'll be waiting
for your press announcement

1301
01:30:05,464 --> 01:30:06,693
我会等着看你的新闻发布会
first thing in the morning.

1302
01:30:06,899 --> 01:30:08,527
- 然后我们再谈谈
- 汤姆
- And then we'll talk.
- Tom.

1303
01:30:08,734 --> 01:30:11,795
如果这些指控中有一点事实的影子
If there's any inkling of truth
in any of these charges,

1304
01:30:12,004 --> 01:30:14,235
如果有任何人动过他的一根头发
if anyone has ever harmed
a hair on his head,

1305
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:15,669
我都会查清楚的
I will find out about it.

1306
01:30:15,874 --> 01:30:17,604
你还有12小时，参议员
You have 1 2 hours, senator.

1307
01:30:17,810 --> 01:30:20,279
但是如果这不是真的
But if it's not true,

1308
01:30:20,479 --> 01:30:22,846
我会在议会上对你进行弹劾
I will see you impeached
on the floor of the Senate

1309
01:30:23,048 --> 01:30:25,244
把你送进坟墓
and bury you.

1310
01:30:28,353 --> 01:30:29,844
晚安
Good night.

1311
01:30:33,459 --> 01:30:35,553
简直是荒谬
It's preposterous.

1312
01:30:36,428 --> 01:30:38,624
痴人说梦
Idiotic story.

1313
01:30:39,631 --> 01:30:41,827
妈妈，我要告诉你一些事
Mother, there's something
I have to tell you.

1314
01:30:42,034 --> 01:30:43,059
什么？

1315
01:30:44,436 --> 01:30:47,201
我一直在做那些梦

1316
01:30:48,273 --> 01:30:50,799
本说他们可以测验出我到底是不是...
Ben said there were tests
they could run to see if...

1317
01:30:51,009 --> 01:30:53,444
不，你要去哪？
No. Where are you going?

1318
01:30:54,012 --> 01:30:55,344
肖中士
Sergeant Shaw.

1319
01:30:55,547 --> 01:30:57,038
什么？
What?

1320
01:30:58,584 --> 01:31:00,917
雷蒙德・肖中士

1345
01:33:57,562 --> 01:34:01,932
怎么了？发生什么了？

我爸爸在哪？

1347
01:34:04,603 --> 01:34:06,094
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

1348
01:34:06,838 --> 01:34:09,706

to rescue Jordan

1355
01:35:07,866 --> 01:35:11,530
未能抵挡冰冷刺骨的海水也同时丧生

Governor Arthur, do you have
any comment on this tragic event?

1363
01:35:34,326 --> 01:35:38,423
乔丹参议员是一位十分正直的政治家
Senator Jordan was a statesman
of the highest integrity.

1364
01:35:38,997 --> 01:35:40,989

其他的稍后会继续报道
That's all for now. We'll have
something for you a little later.

It is a move that could save the
Defense Department billions of dollars.

1373
01:36:08,126 --> 01:36:09,355

你知道我在说谁，未来新总统
You know who I'm talking about,
the new president.

If he dies, Raymond Shaw becomes
the new president, doesn't he?

1376
01:36:14,366 --> 01:36:16,164
总统继任，这就是你们的如意算盘吧
Chain of succession.
That's what you got in mind.

1377
01:36:16,368 --> 01:36:17,529
那就是你们想要做的吧
That's what you people wanna do.

1378

苏西？罗西？
You wanna really run the world,
don't you, Susie? Rosie?

1379
01:36:20,005 --> 01:36:22,804

去图书馆查资料，还拿到了你的录音带
Whatever the hell your name is. I got
my library card and I got your tapes.

1380
01:36:23,008 --> 01:36:24,806
我也在做我的调查
我们一起去联邦调查局
I do my research too.
We're going to the feds,

1381
01:36:25,010 --> 01:36:27,912
我们一起去警察局
或者报社，随便哪里都行
we're going to the police,
the newspapers, whatever it takes.

1382
01:36:28,647 --> 01:36:30,548
我就是联邦调查局的
I am the feds.

1383
01:36:30,749 --> 01:36:32,718
现在，放开我！

放开我！
Get off of me!

1385
01:36:50,602 --> 01:36:52,434
我们在艾尔・迈尔文身上...

正如你所说

希望找出线索
Trying to sort this thing out.

1392
01:37:14,726 --> 01:37:16,422
这不是选举，这是一场政变
This isn't an election, this is a coup.

1393
01:37:16,628 --> 01:37:20,429
这是--在我们自己的国家里
一次政权的更替，在我们自己的国家里
This is-- In our own country,
a regime change, in our own country.

1394
01:37:20,632 --> 01:37:22,897
本，不要，本
Ben, don't. Ben.

用罪恶的技术
This is rich people, Manchurian Global
funding bad science

1396
01:37:27,739 --> 01:37:32,473
把一个傀儡放进白宫
事实就是这样的，罗西
to put a sleeper in the White House,
and that's what's going on, Rosie.

1397
01:37:32,711 --> 01:37:34,976
- 事实就是如此
- 我希望相信你
- That's what's going on.
- I wanna believe you.

1398
01:37:35,180 --> 01:37:38,048

帮我要么开枪
Shoot me, then.
Help me or shoot me.

1400
01:37:40,118 --> 01:37:41,586
选择一下吧

1401
01:37:41,786 --> 01:37:43,948
选择一下
Make a decision.

1402
01:37:52,631 --> 01:37:55,260
当我遇见你的时候
我已经做出了选择，本.
I made a decision
when I met you, Ben.

1403
01:38:00,939 --> 01:38:03,807
现在,把你找到的资料给我看看吧
Now, why don't you show me
what you have in your file.

1404
01:38:04,809 --> 01:38:06,641
- 先生！
- 议员！
- Sir!
- Congressman!

1405
01:38:09,781 --> 01:38:12,273
先生，你今晚会发言么？
Sir, do you have a statement
for us tonight?

1406
01:38:13,952 --> 01:38:16,285
--极其的清晰简单
--was exceptionally clear

1407
01:38:16,488 --> 01:38:19,117

更有利可图的世界
A stronger, safer,
more profitable world

1408
01:38:19,324 --> 01:38:22,158
由清廉的最高管理者统治
through uncorruptible
top-level management.

1409
01:38:22,427 --> 01:38:24,089
我们将我们的技术交付给你
We trust you with our technology

1410
01:38:24,296 --> 01:38:26,060
而你突然把他变成了一个普通的杀手
and suddenly you turn him
into a common hit man.

1411
01:38:26,264 --> 01:38:29,063
你怎么敢这么说
我相信你们，把儿子交给你们
How fucking dare you.
I trusted you with my son.

1412
01:38:29,267 --> 01:38:30,326
你甚至连问都没不问--
You didn't even ask us--

1413
01:38:30,535 --> 01:38:33,164
别教训我！你向我发誓这是万无一失的
Don't lecture me! You swore to me
that this was fail-safe.

1414
01:38:33,371 --> 01:38:35,636
没有泄漏，没有故障，没有--
不会做梦
No leaks, no glitches, no--
No dreams.

1415
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:37,536
对雷蒙德做的一切都不会留下丝毫痕迹--
Not even a shadow of what was done
to Raymond--

1416
01:38:37,742 --> 01:38:39,802
在你行动之前应该问一下
这不是一个--
You needed to ask before you acted.
This is not a--

1417
01:38:40,011 --> 01:38:42,640
汤姆・乔丹要毁掉我儿子
和我所为之奋斗的一切
Tom Jordan was going to destroy
my son and everything I've worked for,

1418
01:38:42,847 --> 01:38:45,112
和我们相关的每一个人都得遭殃
你想让我怎么做？
and every one of us along with it.
And you wanted me to what?

1419
01:38:45,317 --> 01:38:47,582
- 召开会议？
- 现在听我说
- Call a meeting?
- Now, look, look, look.

1420
01:38:48,987 --> 01:38:51,684
在历史的长河中...
In the larger course of history...

1421
01:38:52,424 --> 01:38:53,915
...有着关键人物...
...there are key players...

1422
01:38:54,392 --> 01:38:56,520
...也有配角，参议员
...and role players, senator.

1423
01:38:56,728 --> 01:39:00,688
屁话！这关系到我的儿子
和这个国家的未来
Bullshit! This is about my son
and the future of this country.

1424
01:39:01,866 --> 01:39:04,392
我一直以为我们彼此了解
I thought we understood each other.

1425
01:39:05,103 --> 01:39:07,129
我是这样认为的
我想我们是互相了解的
I think we do. I think we really do.

1426
01:39:07,339 --> 01:39:09,934
- 金钱就是你的上帝
- 哦，等等，等等，那你的是...？
- Your god is money.
- Oh, wait, wait, and yours is...?

1427
01:39:10,141 --> 01:39:11,575
不，不，我是一个信徒
No, no. I'm a believer.

1428
01:39:11,776 --> 01:39:13,711
我是个乐观主义者，我相信未来
I am an optimist.
I believe in the future.

1429
01:39:13,912 --> 01:39:15,505
相信未来的人，那些创造历史
And people who do,
the ones who make history

1430
01:39:15,714 --> 01:39:17,342
而不是坐井观天的人
instead of just sitting around
watching it,

1431
01:39:17,549 --> 01:39:19,848
不，他们甘于冒大风险
no, they're willing to take
the big risks.

1432
01:39:20,051 --> 01:39:21,747
是的，我做出了决定
Yes, I made a decision.

1433
01:39:22,354 --> 01:39:25,256
哦，上帝！那些人都到哪里去了?
Oh, God! Where are
all the men anymore?

1434
01:39:25,523 --> 01:39:27,617
我的父亲，泰勒・普兰蒂斯
他从来不征询意见
My father, Tyler Prentiss,
never asked,

1435
01:39:27,826 --> 01:39:30,261
“这样可以么？这样可以么？”
"ls this okay? Is this okay?"

1436
01:39:30,462 --> 01:39:32,431
你懂我意思么，马克？
You know what I'm saying, Mark?

1437
01:39:32,631 --> 01:39:35,499
他只是做他该做的事情
He just did what needed to be done.

1438
01:39:36,201 --> 01:39:39,137
来吧，太阳升起来了，纽约
今天是纽约市重要的一天
Come on, rise and shine, New York.
It's a big day in the Big Apple.

1439
01:39:39,337 --> 01:39:42,774
是的，所有的民意测验都表明
所有的民意测验都显示，今天全纽约5个区
That's right. All polls indicate
that New Yorkers will be turning out

1440
01:39:42,974 --> 01:39:45,102
在5个区参加总统选举投票
的选民人数
in record numbers today
across the five boroughs

1441
01:39:45,310 --> 01:39:46,869
将创下纪录
to select a new president.

1442
01:39:47,078 --> 01:39:49,547
至少大幅广告牌上是那么说的
At least, that's how the billboard
says it's supposed to happen.

1443
01:39:49,748 --> 01:39:51,273
投票将于早上6点开始
The polls open at 6 a. m.

1444
01:39:51,483 --> 01:39:54,885
在曼哈顿，布鲁克林，皇后区，布朗克斯
And bars and taverns in Manhattan,
Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx,

1445
01:39:55,086 --> 01:39:58,056
和史德顿岛的酒吧会在稍后开放
and Staten Island will be
opening shortly thereafter.

1446
01:39:58,256 --> 01:40:02,125
是的，纽约市民们
我们今天全天都可以免费畅饮，投票选举
That's right, New Yorkers. We are
free to drink and vote all day today.

1447
01:40:19,644 --> 01:40:22,307
谢谢，谢谢
Thank you. Thank you.

1448
01:40:22,514 --> 01:40:24,380
谢谢你们
Thanks for coming out.

1449
01:40:27,519 --> 01:40:29,488
议员，祝你好运
Congressman, good luck.

1450
01:40:30,088 --> 01:40:32,990
- 你好
- 嗨
- Hello.

- 嗨，太感谢你了
- 未来的副总统，先生
- Hey. Thank you very much.
- The next vice president, sir.

1452
01:40:37,796 --> 01:40:39,128
但愿如此
I hope so.

1453
01:40:39,364 --> 01:40:42,198
- 努力争胜
- 我们支持你，我们支持你
- Let's have a win.
- We're with you. We're with you.

1454
01:40:42,567 --> 01:40:44,433
谢谢，托尼，保重
Thank you, Tony, take care.

1455
01:40:47,706 --> 01:40:49,174
谢谢
Thank you.

1456
01:41:12,831 --> 01:41:15,801
保重，再见
非常感谢
Take care. Goodbye.
Thanks very much.

1457
01:41:33,551 --> 01:41:35,076
没问题
It's clean.

1458
01:41:39,357 --> 01:41:40,450
没问题
It's clean.

1459
01:41:41,693 --> 01:41:43,286
好的，埃文
It's all right, Evan.

1460
01:41:51,302 --> 01:41:52,497
你的后背怎么样了？
How's your back?

1461
01:41:55,940 --> 01:41:58,273
我一直在做梦，本
I've been having the dreams, Ben.

1462
01:41:59,110 --> 01:42:00,874
哦，那太好了
Oh, that's good.

1463
01:42:01,813 --> 01:42:03,076
它们在我的脑袋里
They're inside my head.

1464
01:42:03,281 --> 01:42:04,681
我们会摆脱它们的，我有证据了
We'll get them out. I got the proof.

1465
01:42:04,883 --> 01:42:06,784
我知道他们对我们做了什么
只是不知道为什么
I know what they did to us.
I just don't know why.

1466
01:42:06,985 --> 01:42:08,214
我梦到一些事情，本
I dream things, Ben.

1467
01:42:08,420 --> 01:42:10,753
一些不可能发生的恐怖的事情
Terrible things that can't
possibly have happened.

1468
01:42:11,122 --> 01:42:13,114
- 我完了, 本--
- 不，没有，你就在这儿
- I'm gone, Ben--
- No, you're not, you're right here.

1469
01:42:13,758 --> 01:42:15,158
本...
Ben...

1470
01:42:16,060 --> 01:42:18,120
...我要给你一个东西
...there's something I want
you to have.

1471
01:42:23,201 --> 01:42:25,067
我不配得到它
I don't deserve this.

1472
01:42:30,742 --> 01:42:32,142
乔斯林的死
Jocelyn's dead.

1473
01:42:33,478 --> 01:42:34,673
我知道
I know.

1474
01:42:35,814 --> 01:42:37,112
还有参议员
And the senator.

1475
01:42:39,150 --> 01:42:40,482
是的
Yeah.

1476
01:42:42,253 --> 01:42:44,017
是我...？
Did l...?

1477
01:42:46,291 --> 01:42:48,157
我想是的，雷蒙德，是的
I think so, Raymond, yes.

1478
01:42:49,494 --> 01:42:53,932
我不记得了，本
我不记得了
I don't remember, Ben.
I don't remember.

1479
01:42:54,899 --> 01:42:56,424
雷蒙德...
Raymond...

1480
01:42:56,868 --> 01:42:59,736
...他们有没有告诉你要你做什么?
...did they tell you what it is
they want you to do?

1481
01:42:59,938 --> 01:43:01,133
那就是我想要查明的
That's what I gotta find out.

1482
01:43:01,339 --> 01:43:04,605
我想弄清楚要发生什么
在哪发生--
We gotta find out what's gonna
happen, where it's gonna happen--

1483
01:43:04,809 --> 01:43:08,177
我们是朋友么，本？
我愿意相信我们是朋友
Are we friends, Ben?
I wanna believe we were friends.

1484
01:43:08,379 --> 01:43:13,147
我们之间有种联系，没人能从我们这夺走
We are connected and that's
something nobody can take from us.

1485
01:43:14,052 --> 01:43:16,248
你本可以把我关起来，但你没有
You could've had me locked up,
but you didn't.

1486
01:43:16,454 --> 01:43:18,753
这就证明了在我们内心深处
That's proof that there's something
deep inside.

1487
01:43:18,957 --> 01:43:20,585
有些地方是他们无法触及的
There's a part that they can't get to.

1488
01:43:20,792 --> 01:43:23,318
深藏于我们内心，就是真相之所在
And it's deep inside of us.
And that's where the truth is.

1489
01:43:23,528 --> 01:43:26,555
那时我们唯一的希望
那就是你我需要接近的地方
That's our only hope. That's what
you and me need to tap into,

1490
01:43:26,764 --> 01:43:29,666
也是我们用来驱逐恶梦的武器，雷蒙德
and that's what you and I are gonna
use to take them out, Raymond.

1491
01:43:29,868 --> 01:43:32,030
我们时间不多了，拜托了
We don't have much time. Please.

1492
01:43:34,672 --> 01:43:38,109
- 我原以为你会更聪明些的
- 雷蒙德，求你了
- I thought you were smarter than that.
- Raymond, please.

1493
01:43:38,309 --> 01:43:39,971
你认为他们不会预料到这些，本？
You don't think they saw this
coming, Ben?

1494
01:43:40,945 --> 01:43:43,312
你认为他们不会把你考虑进去？
You don't think they factored you in?

1495
01:43:45,950 --> 01:43:49,284
我是你的敌人，马高少校
I am the enemy, Major Marco.

1496
01:43:49,787 --> 01:43:51,619
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

1497
01:43:56,528 --> 01:43:58,019
是的，妈妈
Yes, Mother.

1498
01:43:59,330 --> 01:44:01,231
是的，他就在这
Yes, he's right here.

1499
01:44:03,535 --> 01:44:06,027
- 她想跟你说话
- 我？
- She wants you.
- Me?

1500
01:44:10,208 --> 01:44:11,369
是我，参议员
Yes, senator.

1501
01:44:11,576 --> 01:44:14,546
- 是马高上尉么？
- 是的
- Is this Captain Marco?
- Yeah.

1502
01:44:15,013 --> 01:44:17,676
班尼特・马高上尉？
Captain Bennett Marco?

1503
01:44:18,416 --> 01:44:19,384

快点！
Hurry up!

1508
01:45:20,211 --> 01:45:21,941
马高少校？
Major Marco?

1509
01:45:34,592 --> 01:45:36,117
本？
Ben?

1510
01:45:37,795 --> 01:45:41,493
--民众可以随时集会而不会惹来麻烦
--people can get together whenever
they want and not get in trouble.

1511
01:45:41,866 --> 01:45:44,961
民众应该享有言论自由...
People should be allowed to say
what is on their mind...

1512
01:45:55,346 --> 01:45:56,712
权力和自由法案赋予人民...
The Bill of Rights gives people...

1513
01:46:04,022 --> 01:46:05,217
谢谢
Thank you.

for their anticipated victory party.

1518
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:18,229
他的竞选对手，现任副总统纳尔逊

子弹就会击中鲍勃・亚瑟
The bullet will strike Bob Arthur
the moment you step forward

1524
01:47:23,801 --> 01:47:26,600

and arrive on your star beside him.

1525
01:47:26,804 --> 01:47:29,933
因为刺客...

1526
01:47:32,744 --> 01:47:35,714
...那个疯狂的，变态的...
...the deranged, obsessed...

1527
01:47:35,913 --> 01:47:39,816
...可悲的疯狂枪手...

...是想要刺杀你

马高少校是个神枪手

但你必须纹丝不动
But you must stay very, very still

1531
01:47:50,828 --> 01:47:54,265
站在你应该站着的地方
and stand right where you're
supposed to stand.

1532
01:47:54,766 --> 01:47:56,530
本会怎么样?
What happens to Ben?

1533
01:47:57,802 --> 01:48:00,601
刺客总是会死的，孩子
The assassin always dies, baby.

1534
01:48:01,072 --> 01:48:03,837
为了拯治国家
这是很有必要的
It's necessary for

少到你不会注意到
Not so much that you would notice,

1544
