Okay, I'm going to ask you
to take a deep breath in.

2
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,044
And you can let it go.

Should I do it again?

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,011
No, one is good.

5
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,525
...upset about?
Apparently last tuesday...

...we had this fundraiser...
有个筹款人带的是棒棒糖蛋糕

...and I brought cupcakes,
she brought cake pops.

她的意思好像是干吗跟我带一样的

9
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,522

"No, a cupcake is a cupcake.
我说 哪里 纸杯蛋糕就是纸杯蛋糕

10
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,847
A cake pop is cake
with a stick in it."
棒棒糖蛋糕是有跟棍子插住的

But the real issue is...

00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,681
...her daughter Alicia
is a very nice girl,

00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,962
but not very smart,
whereas my daughter Anna...

We can't find anything.

She puts things in
the weirdest places.

33
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,242
Like, if I leave my

34
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,522
she'll put it in a kitchen drawer!

Why can't you just do it?
你为什么不能狠点心呢

36

It's not fair.
哪里没有 我炒了园丁 你这么说太不公平了

We want to fire her,
and he won't do it.
我想要炒了她 他不愿意

you'd have big,

Did they just turn
the music louder?

No, I think you just got older.

down the music a little?

你对我的年纪抱歉还是调低声音

change it, ma'am.

I'm sorry, I picked
the wrong restaurant.

What is this, tomatoes?

Tomatoes? It's watermelon.

That's croutons next to it.

Doesn't that defeat the purpose?

It's nonfat yogurt, not ice cream.
You can put little stuff on it.

I know. Give me this.

there's so many millions of them.

It's just... I'm not sure.

我想说如果他马上另寻新欢 我就傻逼了

what she's talking about.

middle-aged, but I don't care.
我的意思是 他中年了又很肥 不过我不介意

not really good with poetry.
有点不安啊 我不太懂诗歌啊

When we first started dating, I thought,
第一次约会的时候 我还想

957
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,006
"Oh, he's mature. He can buy a house."
他是土豪啊 还有钱买房子

958
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,569
- This house? - Yes!
- 这栋房子吗 - 是的

959
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,089
But you should see where he lives now.
And he made...
看看他现在的家 还有他用

960
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:05,366
...this dish of spaghetti
with eggplant and mozzarella.
茄子和玛苏里拉奶酪做的意大利面

961
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,364
Sounds kind of delicious.
听起来很好吃的样子

962
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,927
But it turned out that
was all he could cook.
不过他只会做那一道

963
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,927
And he has no friends.
I mean, neither do I, but...
他没有朋友 我也没有 不过

964
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,405
Well, me and Joni.

- Hungry? - Yes.

- You okay? - Yeah.

I had two massages.
有两位客人

Barnacles?
一言不发还是

00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,085
Non-stop talking? Boners?
说个没完 还是勃起男

978
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:15,444
There was this nice woman in Santa Monica.

She talked a lot about her ex-husband.

I just hope it wasn't my ex-wife.

我需要就买了

不过我忘记我买过了 就又买了更多

1012
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,522
And you have like 80 million toothbrushes.
牙刷也很多

1013
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,801
I do?

I only use one of them.

So why don't you throw the other ones out?

I don't know. Because... they're my friends?

You looked so pretty.

1026

It's in fives.

Thank you for including me.

You really have a fight with your mom?

1030
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,203
- Huge. - Where's your dad?

He lives in San Diego, but
you'd think he was in Alaska.
他在圣地亚哥 不过好像他在阿拉斯加一样

1033

But I don't care.
不过我无所谓了

1034
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:48,728
He remarried this really weird
woman, and she never talks.
他和一个好像哑巴的女人结婚了

1035
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,803
Hear, hear for second marriages!
好好听听人家的经历

1036
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,246
It's kind Of true, though. 
不过有一点倒是真的

1037
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:55,005
It's good when everyone is older and wiser.
年长的和更加睿智的会愈加适合

1038
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,081
Steady.

1039
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,567
Maybe second marriages work because 
people have figured out how to compromise.
也许二次婚姻顺利的关键在于你不怎么计较了

1040
00:54:58,800 --> 00:54:59,801
Or behave. Perhaps.

- Nobody's talking about you.

Don't take it personally.
I'm talking generally.
别对号入座 我说的是一般情况

1043
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:09,330
If I got married again, I'd be on the
lookout for the inevitable problems.
如果我要再婚的话 绝对不自找麻烦

1044
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,164
Odd conversation. Pretty weird.
多么奇怪的谈话啊

1045
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,880
Sorry, but maybe don't get
married a second time.
不好意思 我想你没有机会的

1046
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,003
I'm not saying I will. I'm just saying.

She's just saying.

you first husband like?
弗兰 你前夫怎么样

1049
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:26,323
Oh, he was actually a lovely, lovely man.
But not for me.
他其实是个很好的男人 只是不适合我

1050
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,765
Very grownup!

He passed away. Two years ago.

Oh, I'm sorry.

1053
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,161
Sorry. Could we get some more bread, please?

1055
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,765

Are you even gonna eat it?

I don't know, but somebody else might want some.

1059
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,525
- I probably will. - Me, too.
-我想吃 -我也是

1060
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,171
Bread eater, bread eater.
有两位想吃面包的啊

1061
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,760
I'm sorry. So, Fran, you eat bread, I see.
所以 弗兰 你喜欢吃面包啊

1062
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,365
It's true!
对啊

1063
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,001
So that means you get to keep cookies 
in  the house all the time.
所以说你们家一直都用饼干咯

1064
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,361
I can.

What are you guys talking about?
你们在说什么啊

1066
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,522
It's not a big deal, but I have a little 
trouble controlling myself...
没什么 不过我自控力不好

1067
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,286
...so when Peter would
bring home things like...
每次彼得带回家的巧克力啊

1068
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,523
...chocolate or good
bread, yummy stuff,
面包啊 或者其他好吃的

1069
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,608
I'd eat all of it,
then I hate myself.
我都会吃的一干二净 之后我就后悔

1070
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,530
And me for bringing it home 
in the first place.
还有责怪我干嘛把他们带回家

1071
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,045
So did you stop buying it?
所以你就再也不买了

1072
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,203
- Yeah, I did. - And you got so angry.

1073
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,283
- I was not angry. - A little bit angry.

1074
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:17,691
Well, he should have been angry.
他生气理所当然啊

1075
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,366
Why should he be deprived because
she can't control herself?
为什么她自控力差就要他也陪着受罪

1076
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,405
Because she's his wife and
he's trying to help her?

Yes!
当然

1079
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,082
Not if we want her to
learn to control herself.
为什么不让她自己学习自控呢

1080
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,321
"We?"
我们是指谁

1081
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,562
I just said it's not fair to him.
我只是认为这对他不公平

1082
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,644
Why does everything have to be fair?
What are you, six?
为什么每件事都要公平 你还当你是六岁小孩吗

Of course... What? Let's keep it nice.
当然 和善点好吗

1084
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,880
I just forget the cookies are there. So...
我忘了那天还有饼干呢 

1085
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:44,484
That's why it's good you're
married to Peter and I'm not.
这就是为什么你适合彼得而我不适合了

1086
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:47,167
That is absolutely the God's honest truth.

00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,804
Ooh, it's cold out.

Let me ask you a question.
问你个问题

divorced, what do you tell them?

should have been together.

everything, you talk to her about us.

when you were five years old.

thinking about this color.

so you can take it with you.
我要把它打完 你就可以带着去上学了

以防万一 我还是买一条吧

What are you talking about?
This will be good.

things about your dad?

Tess to school, not me.

you both just take her?

I don't think so. No, I don't.

He's such a wreck about her going away.

She doesn't need that kind of energy right now.

And he just focuses so much onto her.
She can feel it.

For instance... this is typically Albert...

was on the side of the bed again.

but he never went out and replaced them.
他就放肆了

his shit on the floor again.
把东西直接扔在地上

building a life for himself.

Okay, these are just little things.
