- Paul, that's my name.- Rosemary: Good.

340
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,940
You have a concussion,so we need to keep talking.

341
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,180
- Okay?- Paul: Okay.

342
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,840
All right.

343
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:36,880
That light.

344
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,910
How'd you get there?

345
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,410
I...

346
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:48,610
l was workingat the Fairlane Center

347
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,140
when the whole mallwent dark.

348
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:55,180
All the people were all gone.

349
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:58,480
So l was on my wayout of there

350
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,180
when my light starts dying.

351
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:07,780
And then someone cameout of the dark and hit me.

352
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,910
I was taken somewhere.

353
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:16,110
And then my light came back onand l was outside.

354
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,640
I don't even knowhow l got there, but l--

355
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:21,810
l walked till l foundthat bus shelter.

356
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:24,980
Taken?

357
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,840
Taken.

358
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:30,940
I don't know where.

359
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,110
I don't know where

360
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,680
but there were these voices.

361
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,480
These whispers.

362
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,280
No bodies. No faces.

363
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,740
- Souls.- Only shadows.

364
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:48,410
And l was drowningin them.

365
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,140
So l started screaming.

366
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,440
Started screaming.

367
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,680
But there was no sound.

368
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,840
There was no sound.

369
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,240
It was like l was fighting,fighting for air.

370
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,340
Like l was fighting to exist.

371
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,980
Sounds like some kindof fever dream.

372
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,840
No.Dreams are much more

373
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:23,340
broken apart, more obscure.

374
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,540
I was taken someplacefor three days.

375
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,210
Rosemary:We need to keep you warm.

376
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,380
This was in real time.

377
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:33,580
Luke: So did you get a lookat the guy that hit you?

378
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:36,540
Paul: I told you-- l told youit wasn't a person.

379
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,040
You saw it too, didn't you?

380
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,140
I knew it.

381
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,210
When l was lying there,

382
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:54,040
waiting for the bus,

383
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:56,140
l had time and l wentthrough the list--

384
00:38:56,310 --> 00:39:00,410
of all the ways everyonecould just disappear--

385
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:03,140
flesh-eating bacterias,

386
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:05,740
nanotech run amok,

387
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,140
a particle collider accident,

388
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:10,810
parallel universes,neutron bombs,

389
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,710
- gamma ray bursts...- Alien abduction.

390
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,240
...singularities,wormholes, black holes--

391
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:19,740
- Stop it!- The thing is, the math doesn't add up.

392
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:21,840
The mathdoes not add up.

393
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:24,410
My boy is missing.

394
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,540
His mother...

395
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,580
It just doesn't add up.

396
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:33,180
This is no accident.There's a reason.

397
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,710
You gonna lay yourCatholic guilt on us now?

398
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,680
So why are you here, Luke?

399
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,440
You know?

400
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:43,340
No idea.And l don't care.

401
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,940
Well, you should.

402
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:49,610
We all--we all should.

403
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:52,240
Why didn't we gowith everyone else?

404
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:54,480
- Paul: Because...- Why?

405
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,610
Like when you shut downa movie projector,

406
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:00,280
it doesn't just stop on a dime.It winds down.

407
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,610
We're the last spin on the reelbefore it stops for good.

408
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,580
I know l've done thingsin my life--

409
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,140
awful things.L've hurt people.

410
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:13,440
L've made mistakes.

411
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,480
We all have.

412
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,810
So what are you saying,that this is punishment?

413
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,540
For what?

414
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:23,480
- That's between you and...- And God?

415
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,580
Between me and God?I think God's closed up shop

416
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,840
- just like everybody else.- Don't say that!

417
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,710
You trying to tell methat he deserves this shit?

418
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,910
- Leave him alone!- I think you're just pissed off

419
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,110
- 'cause Jesus didn't beam you up.- Stop it! No!

420
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,340
We don't need somefucking left-behind sermon.

421
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:40,880
What we need to do is--oh no, no.

422
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,080
( jukebox skipping )

423
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:52,340
( shadows moaning )

424
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:55,510
Sweet Jesus. Sweet Jesus.

425
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,180
- Lessen the load.- What?

426
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,180
The power load on the genny,you got to lessen it.

427
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,910
Turn off anythingwe don't need.

428
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,010
James, get the games.The jukebox.

429
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,440
Luke:Turn 'em off! Turn 'em off!

430
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:14,740
Get the neon signs!

431
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,940
( chugging )

432
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,580
Paul:Strip the top off!

433
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:24,080
- Ah!- Looks like somebody rerouted it

434
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,210
up to the barafter the main grid died.

435
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,880
Yeah, my mom.

436
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,040
At leastwe got plenty of gas.

437
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:33,210
It doesn't matter.It doesn't matter.

438
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,310
The electric chargeis fading anyway.

439
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,880
Like the batteriesand the flares...

440
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,940
And the carsand everything.

441
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,980
It's just impossible.

442
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,640
But the bus shelter,the one you were under...?

443
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:47,640
Luke: Solar-powered--an experimental one-off.

444
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:49,240
The city was thinkingof going green for a while.

445
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:52,180
- I did a piece on it.- Okay, so solar's working.

446
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:55,980
Yeah.Too bad the sun's not.

447
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,410
( banging )

448
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,610
James, where's this go?

449
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:04,280
Sonny says it's where we gowhen the shit hits the fan.

450
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,410
Sonny had a point.

451
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:11,580
All right, rocket scientist,how long?

452
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,410
- How long what?- How long we got?

453
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,210
- How long till it dies?- All: Yeah.

454
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,580
Couple hours. I don't know.Couple minutes.

455
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:20,940
There are no known laws of physicsoperating here, okay?

456
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:23,280
I don't fucking know!I don't know! I don't know!

457
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,940
- Hey! Whoa whoa!- What are you doing?

458
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,110
- I don't know!- ( Rosemary whimpering )

459
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,240
Rosemary: Please, God,please, God, save us.

460
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,440
( groans )

461
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:38,280
Luke: Come on,take it easy.

462
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,780
Okay. Okay.

463
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:55,010
( gasps )

464
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,310
Rosemary:Please, God...

465
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,540
please, God,please, God, please, God.

466
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:06,040
Please, God.Please, God, help us.

467
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:13,010
There's this island--

468
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,610
this island right offthe Carolinas

469
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,940
called Roanoke.

470
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,810
In 1587 it was--

471
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:23,940
it was the firstEnglish colony.

472
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:27,110
117 men, women and children

473
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,040
are living there.

474
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:32,910
And one day a boat comesfrom London with supplies.

475
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,040
But lo and behold,there's nobody to supply,

476
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:40,810
'cause everybody's gone.

477
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:44,140
The whole entire colonycompletely vanished.

478
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:47,780
Left everything behind--food, livestock, clothing.

479
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:51,310
They sent search partieslooking for everybody for days

480
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,010
and the only thingthey find--

481
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,910
you know what they find?One word.

482
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,610
One word.

483
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:00,080
Just scratched--

484
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,440
scratched on a fencepost--

485
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:07,840
"Croatoan."

486
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,710
James:Croa-what?

487
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,710
Croatoan.

488
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,910
What does it--what does it mean?

489
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,180
I don't know.Nobody knows.

490
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,180
It's just a big mystery.

491
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:24,710
Maybe it's a messagefrom the local Indians or--

492
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,280
or a word, or...

493
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,610
just a last word.

494
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:32,080
Nobody knows for sure.

495
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,440
But maybe it's--

496
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:37,310
maybe it's a warning.

497
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,440
A warning like an error warningyour computer gives you

498
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:42,410
right before it crashes.

499
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,710
A warning from who?

500
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,740
Does it really matter?Huh?

501
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:50,910
Someone just hitthe restart button

502
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:54,710
and the lost colony was just thislittle warning right before the--

503
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,640
right before this--this-- this big reboot.

504
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:01,210
- Whoa!- Paul!

505
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,510
Paul: Feels like a semismashed into my skull.

506
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,540
Rosemary: That's becauseyou think too much.

507
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:09,780
James, wet the towel,sweetie.

508
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:12,280
There we go.

509
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,080
We need ice.

510
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,110
L'm just gonnaraise your head up.

511
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,580
Just breathe.Breathe. Breathe.

512
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,040
Rosemary:Keep breathing. That's it.

513
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:31,780
Slow down. Slow down.

514
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,180
( inhales )

515
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:54,640
Luke:Hello?

516
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:57,140
Anybody here?

517
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,310
Stephen?

518
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,810
Somebody here?

519
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,880
( clicks, grunts )

520
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,180
( shadow squealing )

521
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:28,080
( gasps )

522
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,780
Control room.

523
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,140
( audio squeaking )

524
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:38,280
Anchorman: ...reporter Luke Rydercontinues his series

525
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:41,610
on a storm of controversysurrounding alleged security lapses

526
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:43,310
at the West Havennuclear power plant.

527
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,040
Yeah, you definitelydon't want to miss that.

528
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:46,710
And speaking of storms,Paige...

529
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,280
Well that's right,Carolyn and Stephen.

530
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,210
We're tracking a very large frontmoving in our direction.

531
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,540
Kind of an unusual storm...

532
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:55,710
( audio squeaking )

533
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,680
...the good news isthis low pressure system

534
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:02,740
is followed by a very nicehigh pressure front, so things...

535
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:05,010
( Paige gasps,screams )

536
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:11,940
( audio squeaking )

537
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:15,280
...so things...( screams )

538
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:24,480
Man:Lt defies any logical

539
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,880
or rational explanation.

540
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,910
Hey! Hey!

541
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,580
Man:You can't say that it's evil.

542
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:35,210
You can't say that it's humanor not human.

543
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:37,940
But it is...

544
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:40,540
the new law of nature,

545
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:43,210
and we have to adapt.

546
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:45,840
Last nightafter the blackout

547
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:49,680
l heard my brother call out to mefrom the darkness.

548
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,780
My brother diedeight years ago

549
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:55,310
in an automobile accident.

550
00:47:56,710 --> 00:48:00,610
It can trick you.Stay near a light source.

551
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,610
But do not trust any light

552
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,840
other than the one that you hold

553
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:07,440
in your own hand.

554
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:11,140
This is David Breardan,at WDID in Chicago.

555
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:14,740
If you're receiving this broadcast,then your phone circuit may still work.

556
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:18,080
Please, call or text meat this number--

557
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,610

558
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,710
( system whines )

559
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:27,380
Damn it.

560
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:37,640
Hello?

561
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:39,510
Woman's voice:Luke.

562
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,910
( voices whispering )

563
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:50,710
( moaning )

564
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:58,210
( shadows moaning )

565
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:10,480
( panting )

566
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,480
- ( Paul groans )- Rosemary: All right.

567
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:30,280
( sighs )

568
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:38,080
We need to getout of here-- now.

569
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,880
He can't go anywhere.

570
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,040
- ( slams )- ( gasps )

571
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:45,240
Don't you get it?Why we're here?

572
00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:48,980
At this exact place?All of us?

573
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:51,710
L'll tell you why.

574
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:56,780
The light.

575
00:49:57,810 --> 00:49:59,380
The light's protecting us.

576
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:03,440
Protecting us?Ever see moths fly into a flame?

577
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:08,580
What are you trying to say?You trying to say this is a trap?

578
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:12,780
Luke:A trap, a dead end.

579
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:16,410
But whatever's out thereis in here now.

580
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:19,440
Point is when thatgenny dies, we die.

581
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:22,210
Maybe that's howit should be.

582
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:27,510
What?

583
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,680
All of ushave seen them--

584
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,080
those souls

585
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,310
out there in the dark.

586
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:37,980
How do we knowthey're not the people

587
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:40,140
we've already lostcalling us over?

588
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:42,110
How do we knowthat that's not heaven

589
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,110
and this is...

590
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:51,140
( shadows moaning )

591
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:54,980
Lf my boy's with them,then that's where l'm meant to be.

592
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:57,610
And if he's not...

593
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:00,880
then l ain't going nowheretill l find him.

594
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,340
( groaning )

595
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:10,710
( sighs )

596
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:13,840
Look.There's a truck,

597
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:16,980
l don't know, maybe five,eight blocks away.

598
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:19,680
The power's drained,but it's not dead.

599
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,140
Now if we can get it started,

600
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:22,680
we all have a chanceof getting out of here...

601
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:26,180
maybe get you to a hospital.

602
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:28,040
Oh yeah?A hospital where, man?

603
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:31,680
- Where?- Chicago.

604
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,410
The morning after it happened,l caught a satellite feed.

605
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:37,310
There are survivorsout there like us.

606
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,310
Paul: So where arethe rescue parties, huh?

607
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:42,240
Lt's been three days.I don't see any search parties.

608
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:43,980
I don't know, all right?

609
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:49,210
All l know is l'm gonnaroll that truck to this genny.

610
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:52,680
L'm gonna string some jumper cablesfrom the genny to the truck's battery.

611
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,540
L'm gonna start that truck

612
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:56,510
and l'm gonna get outta herewith or without any of you.

613
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,080
How you gonna roll it?You can barely walk.

614
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,710
Then a little help would be nice.

615
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:07,110
James, we have a vehicle.

616
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,210
All right, we cancover more ground,

617
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:11,440
you know, maybelook for your mom.

618
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:14,310
Your son.

619
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,340
We can wait till morning.

620
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,640
You surethere's one coming?

621
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:28,340
( generator chugging )

622
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,780
( panting )

623
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:35,010
The first couple days,

624
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:39,540
you know, l kept asking myself,"Why am l still here?

625
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:42,040
Why me?"

626
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:44,710
You know,just talking to myself,

627
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,540
running from place to placeshouting my name like an idiot,

628
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:50,210
anything to remind methat l exist.

629
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:54,840
L'm here

630
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:58,510
because l will myselfto exist.

631
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:04,280
( shadows squeal )

632
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:08,110
You know what?Maybe l'm wrong.

633
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:12,080
Maybe this is justa passing storm.

634
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,240
Maybe it ends tomorrow.

635
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,880
You said it yourself,Paul--

636
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,880
a big reboot.

637
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,840
Which means that this could all bea new beginning, right?

638
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:23,010
Not an end.

639
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:27,040
But we can't waitaround here to find out.

640
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:38,340
Those rations downstairs,put as many as you can

641
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:40,610
into these garbage bags, all right?We'll need to bring them with us.

642
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:42,610
And keep an eyeon that generator.

643
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:45,580
It goes black, you take thisand get out of here.

644
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:48,080
What about Paul?L'm supposed to watch him.

645
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,110
Hey, you heard what l said.

646
00:53:56,010 --> 00:53:57,840
Here.

647
00:53:58,010 --> 00:53:59,510
Take this, all right?

648
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,210
Lt's good luck.

649
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,540
L'll bring us back a real one.

650
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,140
Paul:God, you're beautiful.

651
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:16,080
Let me tell you something.You were born for the movies.

652
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,110
I think you missed your calling.

653
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:21,610
Yeah, king of missedopportunities, that's me.

654
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,810
But l never misseda reel change.

655
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:27,410
- Never. Okay, once.- ( Rosemary chuckles )

656
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,040
Tell me, as a woman--

657
00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:34,910
as a beautiful woman--what do you think?

658
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,080
You think l mighthave a chance?

659
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:40,040
I mean, l'm talkinghypothetically.

660
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:44,210
Not with you, but just in general,you think l'm...

661
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:48,340
you know,you think l'm--

662
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:52,010
God, l'm sofucking stupid,

663
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:54,310
going onand on and on.

664
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:09,740
Luke:Hey, we gotta go.

665
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:13,440
No no, hey!

666
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:15,540
Come back.

667
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:18,110
We will.

668
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,380
Don't let himfall asleep, okay?

669
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:36,780
Be brave.

670
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,440
( door shuts )

671
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:46,010
- ( lights crackling )- ( voices whispering )

672
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:55,280
( dog barking )

673
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:12,280
( shadows shrieking )

674
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:25,580
- ( Luke panting )- Rosemary: Come on.

675
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:27,840
Come on! Lt's dead.

676
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:31,440
I just put batteries infour minutes ago.

677
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,110
Luke: This'll do it.It's right over here. Come on.

678
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:44,240
Luke: I must've checked 500 carssince this happened.

679
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:48,240
God damn, if this isn't the only onewith a battery that still works.

680
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:55,840
Why does this one work

681
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:58,710
and all the others don't?

682
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,940
Lt's a Chevy.

683
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:10,180
( groans )There is no reason. All right?

684
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:14,080
Lt's random, you know.Toss of a coin.

685
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,640
Why l'm still here and the suckerwho was driving this boat isn't,

688
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:26,680
Luke: Push!Keep pushing!

689
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,440
James:You're fine.

690
00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:41,840
You got a girl?

691
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:44,510

694
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:51,010
James:I got a ma.

695
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:53,110
You got a ma.

696
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:56,910
Of course you got a ma.Everybody's got a ma.

697
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:59,710
We all got a ma, but...

698
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:03,340
"Umbrellas of Cherbourg."

699
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:05,610

Catherine Deneuve.

702
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:12,340
The music, the colors--

703
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:14,710
she's gonna love it.

704
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,540
Paul?

705
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:22,780

01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:17,740
- ( music playing )- ( beeps )

( sputtering )

755
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:36,380

They're all dead.

762
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,080
Your son.Does he talk yet?

763
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:17,540
Manny, right?

764
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:21,310
Does he talk?

765
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:26,240
He kind of makesfunny sounds.

766
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:29,480
He can nearly say "Mama."

767
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:32,310
And sometimes he'll--

768
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:35,510
he'll point at a light

769
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,740
and he says "Ly-yy."

770
01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:39,940
"Ly-yy, Mama."

771
01:02:42,010 --> 01:02:44,910
Lt's almost "light,"but not really.

772
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,240
What's in Chicago?

773

( lamp clatters )

774

Anna, my wife.

775
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:08,040
We're separated, actually.

776
01:03:10,510 --> 01:03:14,380
I left for my careerand she stayed for hers.

777
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:19,910
She's still there, Luke.

778
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:25,310
Funny thing is, l don't thinkshe'd want to see me...

779
01:03:28,310 --> 01:03:29,610

780
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:32,580
You'll be together again.

You will.

782

Rosemary:Doesn't work.

Shit!Come on!

805

Lt doesn't work.

806
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:17,440
What are we gonna do?

807
