16
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,272
Hello!

17
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,856
John Cameron !

18
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,328
Chingachgook!
How are you?

19
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:53,210
The Master of Life is good, John.

20
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:55,585
Another year passed.

21
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,170
How is it with you?

22
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:01,870
Getting along. Yes, l am.

23
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,094
Nathaniel.

24
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,140
Hello, John.
Cleared another quarter, l see.

25
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,599
Yes, l did.

26
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,770
Alexandra.
Welcome.

27
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,022
Jack, how are you?

28
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,273
Hello, Nathaniel.

29
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,550
How've you been?
Good. Thank you.

30
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,652
Where you boys been trapping?

31
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,590
West of the Cuyahoga.

32
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:26,690
Why is Uncas with you?

33
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:30,990
He should have settled with a woman,
started a family by now.

34
00:05:30,994 --> 00:05:33,828
Hey! Hey!
Hey, Uncas, look!

35
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,336
Mohawk field we saw was five mile long
on the river.

36
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:38,837
Chief Joseph Brandt's field.

37
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:39,880
You take much fur?

38
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,006
That we did.
Lots.

39
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,716
The Horicon's
near trapped-out now.

40
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,176
Where are you
trading your skins?
Castleton?

41
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,260
No.
Schuylerville.

42
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,346
Schuylerville,with the Dutch,
for silver.

43
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:52,600
French and English want to pay with
wampum and brandy.

44
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,605
So what is it, Jack?
What brings you here?

45
00:05:56,689 --> 00:06:00,984
French and lndian army are heading south
out of Fort Carillon to war against the British.

46
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:05,640
l'm helping to raise New York's militia to
fill the Crown's levy.

47
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,911
And the people here are gonna
join in that fight?

48
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,830
We'll see in the morning.
Where're you boys heading?

49
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,609
We'll trap over the fall.
Winter in Can-tuck-ee.

50
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,669
Find a Delaware-speaking
woman for Uncas.

51
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,400
She will say,
"You are the one!"
Bear him many children.

52
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,440
BOY: Then you can
have a boy like me.

53
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,261
Never.
You're too strong.

54
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,846
Turn me old too fast.

55
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,973
That's what he's
doing to his mama.

56
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:52,035
MAN: John Cameron,
thank you for
your hospitality.

57
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,956
Mohawk traded furs
with les francais.

58
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,250
We got no quarrel with les francais.

59
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:04,250
Now les francais
bring Huron, Ottawa,
Abenaki onto Mohawk land.

60
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,426
Now Mohawk will
fight les francais
and Huron.

61
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,346
l speak for
the Twin Rivers Mohawk
of the Six Nations.

62
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:15,267
His Majesty, King George ll,
is very grateful
for your support.

63
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,643
How far up the valley?

64
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,019
Up to Fort William Henry.

65
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,896
That's two nights
and a bit from here.

66
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,274
Should be enough
to remind you all that
France is our enemy.

67
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,151
France is your enemy.

68
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,278
What did you say?

69
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:29,114
While we're at your fort,
what if the French
attack our homes?

70
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,407
What then, Lieutenant?

71
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:33,118
For your homes,
for King, for country!

72
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,204
That's why you men
ought to join this fight!

73
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,290
You do what you want
with your own scalp.

74
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,709
Do not be telling us
what we ought
to do with ours.

75
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:45,010
You call yourself a patriot?
A loyal subject to the Crown?

76
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,966
l do not call myself
subject to much at all.

77
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,389
l agree with some of what
Nathaniel and John say,

78
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,392
but l believe England's
still our sovereign.

79
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,560
l'll go.

80
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,644
We will go to
fight the French.

81
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,979
My brother and l will volunteer up.

82
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:03,482
l'll fight with you, Jack.

83
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,484
l'm staying on my farm.

84
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,903
Any man who goes,
his family's welcome

85
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,738
to fort up with us
till he comes back.

86
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,615
Boys, my sense of it is

87
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,576
we have enough here
to fill the county levy,

88
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,078
and it's a fight
we ought to make.

89
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,164
But first
we got to get terms
from General Webb.

90
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,084
Where are you
meeting him?

91
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,253
We'll go to Albany.

92
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,376
Attention !

93
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,129
We speak for the men,
not command them.

94
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,090
lf they're not allowed
leave to defend
their farms and families

95
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,717
if the French
attack the settlements,

96
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,344
then no colonial militia is going to
Fort William Henry.

97
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,513
They will report or be pressed
into service.

98
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,764
Any of the boys worth having

99
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,349
can disappear into the forest.
They will be found.

100
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,475
And where does that leave you then?

101
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,144
Those men will be
found, arrested. . .

102
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:07,439
l cannot imagine His Majesty,
in his benevolence,

103
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:11,600
would ever object to his loyal
American subjects

104
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,779
defending their hearth and home,
their women and children

105
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,281
Does that mean they
will be granted leave

106
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:19,284
to defend their homes if the settlements
are attacked?

107
00:10:19,472 --> 00:10:22,000
Of course.

108
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,125
You got yourself a colonial militia, General.

109
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,710
lt is what we wanted.

110
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,508
Major Duncan Heyward reporting, sir,

111
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:40,180
en route to Fort William Henry
and bearing dispatches. Safe journey,
l trust?

112
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:43,220
Yes, and l didn't experience anything

113
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:46,140
so surprising from Bristol to Albany
as that that l witnessed here today.

114
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,228
And what was that?

115
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:52,100
The Crown negotiating
the terms of service.

116
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,318
l know.

117
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:56,279
One has to reason with these colonials
to get them to do anything.

118
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:59,190
Tiring, isn't it?
But that's the lay of the land.

119
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:05,250
l thought British policy is
"Make the world England," sir.

120
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:17,092
l see you're to serve
with the 35th Regiment of Foot

121
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:21,012
at Fort William Henry
under Colonel Munro.

122
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:27,850
l'll be marching
the 60th to Fort Edward.

123
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:32,024
Explain to the Major,
he has little to fear

124
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:37,410
from this General Marquis de Montcalm
in the first place,

125
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:41,110
and therefore scant need
of a colonial militia in the second,

126
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:44,869
because the French
haven't the nature for war.

127
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,706
Their Latinate voluptuousness

128
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,334
combines with their Gallic laziness.
And the result is,

129
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,254
they'd rather eat and make love with
their faces than fight.

130
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,520
Might l inquire if
General Webb has heard
from Colonel Munro's
daughters?

131
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:04,055
l was to rendezvous with them
in Albany and escort them
to the fort, sir.

132
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,070
You there,
what does Munro
call you?

133
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,180
The Scotsman has sent you
one of his Mohawk allies
to guide you.

134
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,356
Magua.

135
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:18,500
The Scotsman's daughters
are at the Poltroon's house.

136
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:23,000
A company of the 60th
will accompany you,

137
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:25,290
and Magua will
show you the way.

138
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:29,706
Dawn. At the encampment,
6:00 a.m. sharp.
See to it you're there.

139
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,220
l'll take him
for you, sir.

140
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,518
Cora.

141
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,021
Duncan !

142
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,774
How long have
you been in Albany?

143
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,317
For days and days.

144
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,443
And yourself?

145
00:12:58,527 --> 00:12:59,527
Just arrived.

146
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,364
By God,
it's good to see you.

147
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,254
l don't know
what to say, Duncan.

148
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:27,263
l truly wish they did,
but my feelings don't. . .

149
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,059
Don't go beyond friendship.

150
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,814
Don't you see?

151
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,526
Respect and friendship.

152
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:44,113
lsn't that a reasonable basis
for a man and a woman
to be married?

153
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,407
And all else may grow in time?

154
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,450
Some say that's the way of it.

155
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,702
Some?

156
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,204
Cousin Eugenie,
my father. . .

157
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,081
Well, then, Cora.

158
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,625
ln my heart l know,
once we're joined,

159
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:58,628
we'll be the most
marvelous couple
in London.

160
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,922
l'm certain of that.

161
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,592
So why not let
those whom you trust,
your father,

162
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,011
help settle
what's best for you?

163
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,765
ln view of your indecision,
you should rely
on their judgment.

164
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,100
And mine.

165
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,604
Will you
consider that?

166
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:24,571
Please consider that.

167
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,284
Yes.

168
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,871
Yes, l will.

169
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,455
ALlCE: Duncan !

170
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:38,001
By God, you've grown up.

171
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:39,836
We leave in the morning?

172
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,004
Yes, miss.

173
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,505
l shan't sleep tonight.

174
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,550
What an adventure. Have you seen
the red men?

175
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,177
A few.

176
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:51,180
l absolutely cannot wait to return
to Portman Square,

177
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,932
having been to the wilderness.

178
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,601
lt's so exciting, Duncan.

179
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,656
Alice?

180
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,782
ALlCE: Can we rest soon?

181
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,033
DUNCAN: Absolutely.

182
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,371
You, there.

183
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:02,293
Scout, we must stop soon.
Women are tired.

184
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:06,480
Not here. Two leagues.
Better water. We stop there.

185
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,091
No, stop in the glade just ahead.

186
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:11,560
When the ladies are rested,
we will proceed. Do you understand?

187
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,263


188
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:19,550


189
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,688
Excuse me. What did you say?

190
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:28,480
Magua said,
understand English very well.

191
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,267
DUNCAN: Hold tight!
Come on !

192
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,603
Right! To the right!

193
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:30,220


194
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:35,270
Prepare your firearms!
As three ranks!

195
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:39,659
Make ready!

196
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:46,415
First and second rank,
present!

197
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:48,668
Fire!

198
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,328
No, Duncan.

199
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,207
ln case your aim's any better
than your judgment.

200
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,226
Your wounded
should try walking
on back to Albany.

201
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,812
They'll never make a passage north.

202
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:16,607
Stop it! Stop it!
We need them to get out!

203
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,234
DUNCAN: Why's he
loosing the horses?

204
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,944
Why don't you ask him?

205
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:23,114
Too easy to track.
They'll be heard for miles.

206
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,159
We were headed to
Fort William Henry.

207
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:40,214
We'll take you as far as the fort.

208
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,302
We're walking out of here fast.

209
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:55,896
Unless all of you'd rather
wait for the next Huron
war party to come by.

210
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:13,349
Scout, l'd like to
thank you for your help.

211
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:14,934
How much further is it?

212
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,602
Night and a bit.

213
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,771
Appears we're well away from them.

214
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:21,315
Maybe. Maybe they ain't alone.

215
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,734
That Huron captain back there. . .

216
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,444
The guide? He's a Mohawk.

217
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,655
No Mohawk. He's Huron.

218
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,199
What reason did he have
to murder the girl?

219
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,367
What?

220
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,244
The dark-haired one.

221
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,496
Miss Cora Munro? Murder her?

222
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,792
He never set eyes
on her before today.
She's only been here a week.

223
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,044
Blood vengeance?
A reproach or insult?

224
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,629
Of course not!

225
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,799
How is it
you were so nearby?

226
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:49,427
Came across the war party.
Tracked them.

227
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,762
Then you're assigned
to Fort William Henry?

228
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:52,972
No.

229
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,099
Fort Edward then?

230
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,018
Heading west to Can-tuck-ee.

231
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:01,814
There is a war on.
How is it you are heading west?

232
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,444
Well, we kind of face to the north,

233
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,529
and real sudden-like, turn left.

234
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:13,159
l thought all our colonial scouts
were in the militia.

235
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,494
The militia is fighting
the French in the north !

236
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:19,165
l ain't your scout. And we sure ain't
in no damn militia.

237
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,550
Ottawa, two francais.

238
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,343
What did you say?

239
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,346
Mirrors,

240
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:43,517
tools,
the clothes.

241
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,186
Everything
was inside.

242
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,355
They didn't
take anything.

243
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,316
And moving fast.

244
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:52,943
And a war party.

245
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,614
Let us look after them.

246
00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:00,284
Leave them.

247
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,703
Whoever they are, though they're strangers,

248
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,289
they're at least entitled
to a Christian burial.

249
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:06,457
They can't be left behind.

250
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,583
Let us go, miss.

251
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:13,672
l will not!l've seen the face
of war before, sir,but l've not seen
war made upon women and children.

252
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,550
And almost as cruel
is your indifference.

253
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,938
Miss Munro,

254
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,900
they're not strangers.

255
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:38,155
And they stay as they lay.

256
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:37,420
Why didn't you bury those people?

257
00:28:37,756 --> 00:28:43,000
Anyone looking for our trail
would see it as a sign we passed that way.

258
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:46,765
You knew them well?

259
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:58,944
You were acting for our benefit,
and l apologize.

260
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:02,260
l misunderstood you.

261
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,408
Well, that's to be expected.

262
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,744
My father warned me about. . .

263
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,328
Your father?

264
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,710
Chingachgook.
He warned me about people like you.

265
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,000
Oh, he did?

266
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,628
He said, "Do not try to understand them."

267
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:21,884
Yes. And, "Do not try to make
them understand you.

268
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:26,180
"That is because they are a breed apart
and make no sense."

269
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,580
Why did they turn back?

270
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,165
Burial ground.

271
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,301
"Breed apart. We make no sense?"

272
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,347
ln your particular case, miss,
l'd make allowance.

273
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:52,099
Thank you so much.

274
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:01,191
Where is your real family?

275
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,946
They buried my ma and pa
and my sisters.

276
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:08,031
Chingachgook found me
with two French trappers,

277
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,117
raised me up as his own.

278
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,661
l'm sorry.

279
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:15,998
l do not remember.
l wasn't but one or two.

280
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,418
How did you learn English?

281
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:24,047
My father sent Uncas and l
to Reverend Wheelock's school when l was 10.

282
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:33,348
Why were those people living
in this defenseless place?

283
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,479
After seven years
indentured service

284
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,898
in Virginia,they headed out here

285
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:44,818
'cause the frontier's
the only land available
to poor people.

286
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:47,613
Out here,
they're beholden to none.

287
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,532
Not living by another's leave.

288
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,331
The name was Cameron.

289
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,293
John and Alexandra Cameron.

290
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,364
My father's people
say that at the birth of the sun,

291
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:34,864
and of his brother,
the moon,their mother died.

292
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:36,745
So the sun gave
to the earth her body,

293
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:39,331
from which was
to spring all life.

294
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,210
And he drew forth
from her breast
the stars.

295
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:48,382
The stars, he threw into the night sky
to remind him of her soul.

296
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:57,349
So there's the Camerons' monument.

297
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:02,771
My folks' too,l guess.

298
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,327
You are right, Mr. Poe.

299
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:21,415
We do not understand
what is happening here.

300
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,458
And it's not as l imagined
it would be,

301
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,836
thinking of it in Boston and London.

302
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,004
Sorry to disappoint you.

303
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,922
No, on the contrary.

304
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:35,100
lt is more deeply stirring
to my blood

305
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:38,098
than any imagining
could possibly have been.

306
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:22,059
NATHANlEL:
Top of the next ridge.
The fort's downhill of it.

307
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:27,189
The men of the regiment will fetch
water from the lake,

308
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:30,484
build fires, and provide every
comfort and desire.

309
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:35,739
l cannot wait to see Papa.

310
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:41,781
Fire!

311
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,476
Prepare! Point! Fire!

312
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,774
Open up.

313
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:42,736
l'm Major Duncan Heyward.

314
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,903
Captain Jeffrey Beams.

315
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,322
Didn't expect you
to make it through.

316
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,073
Let's go to Munro.

317
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,716
Hello, boys!

318
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,385
Nathaniel !

319
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:12,350
l need to talk
to you, Jack.

320
00:39:12,352 --> 00:39:15,560
MAN: Uncas!
Thought you and Nathaniel
weren't joining up.

321
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:16,519
We didn't.

322
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,822
Papa! Papa!

323
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:31,034
Alice! Cora!
Why are you here?

324
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:34,079
And where the hell
are my reinforcements?

325
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,958
Get Mr. Phelps.

326
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:45,507
Told you to stay away.
Why did you disobey me, girls?

327
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,801
When? How? l. . .

328
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:48,968
My letter.

329
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,470
There was none.

330
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:51,888
What?
There was no letter.

331
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,473
l sent three couriers
to Webb.

332
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,016
DUNCAN: One called
Magua arrived.

333
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,518
He delivered
no such message.

334
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,186
Does Webb not even know
we are besieged?

335
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,771
Sir, Webb has no idea.

336
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:03,316
And he certainly
does not know
to send reinforcements.

337
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:13,910
What happened to you?

338
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:16,162
On the George Road.
Attacked.

339
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,622
We're fine.

340
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:20,291
Are you all right?
Yes.

341
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,961
What will happen
here, Papa?

342
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,254
We'll be all right, girl.

343
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:27,465
This Magua led us into it.
Eighteen killed.

344
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:31,870
These men came to our aid.
They guided us here.

345
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,500
Thank you.
Do you need anything?

346
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:40,478
Help ourselves
to a few horns
from your powder stores.

347
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:41,896
Some food.

348
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:43,606
lndebted to you.

349
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:49,237
PHELPS: Miss Cora,
how are you?

350
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,656
Hello, Mr. Phelps.

351
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,533
Mrs. McCann
will get some dry
clothes for you.

352
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:54,951
CORA: Thank you.

353
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,205
Go with your sister, Alice.

354
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:05,086
lt'll be all right, girl.

355
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,589
lt'll be all right.

356
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,480
Might l inquire
after the situation, sir,

357
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:27,317
given that l've seen
the French engineering
from the ridge above?

358
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:31,362
The situation is,
his guns are bigger than
mine and he has more of them.

359
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:35,492
We keep our heads down
while his troops dig
30 yards of trench a day.

360
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:38,036
When those trenches are 200 yards 
from the fort and within range,

361
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,579
he'll bring in his 15-inch mortars,

362
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:43,249
lob explosive rounds
over our walls and pound us to dust.

363
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:48,700
They look to be
300 yards out.

364
00:41:48,704 --> 00:41:52,870
lf they're digging 30 yards a day,
you have three days.
Damn. Damn.

365
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:56,304
This man here can make a run
straight through to Webb.

366
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:59,349
Three days is not enough time
to get to Albany and back
with reinforcements.

367
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:05,210
Webb's not in Albany.
He marched the 60th to Fort Edward two days ago.

368
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,689
Webb is at Edward?

369
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:07,815
Yes, sir.

370
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,400
That's only
12 miles away.

371
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:12,278
He could have
reinforcements here
the day after tomorrow.

372
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,406
You, sir, pick your man.
Major Heyward will provide a diversion.

373
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:16,908
l'll draft out a dispatch.

374
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:19,911
Captain Beams
will seek you out
and give it to you later.

375
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:23,540
Something else.
Cameron's cabin.
Frontier cabin.

376
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:28,070
Came upon it yesterday.
lt was burnt out,everyone murdered.

377
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:30,672
lt was Ottawa,
allied to the French.

378
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:35,885
Aye.

379
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:38,721
So?

380
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:43,935
lt was a war party.

381
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:47,897
That means they're gonna be
attacking up and down
the frontier.

382
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:49,691
Thank you, sir.

383
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:53,860
People here,
Mohawks, settlers,
have family out there.

384
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,655
That'll be all, sir!

385
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,043
Things were done.Nobody was spared.

386
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:16,009
Those considerationsare subordinate to
the interests of the Crown.

387
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:19,429
A terrible feature of war
here in the Americas,
Major Heyward.

388
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:22,974
Best keep your eye fixed on our duty,
to defeat France.

389
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:26,769
That hangs on a courier to Webb.

390
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,795
For my children are the children
of the true faith.

391
00:43:53,800 --> 00:44:03,005
My friendship and esteem is boundless.
Tomorrow, l will sing the war song with you
at the great council fire.

392
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:18,260
Magua, how are things
with your English friends?

393
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:25,410
We're at one.Join us.Hear what Le Subtil
has to tell us.

394
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:33,760
The English war chief,
Webb, goes to Fort Edward
with 60th Regiment.

395
00:44:33,803 --> 00:44:37,680
He does not know that my father's army
attacks Fort William Henry.

396
00:44:37,757 --> 00:44:40,291
Magua was successful?

397
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:44,380
The other two couriers
died in the forest.

398
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:50,770
By now, Munro would know his dispatch
did not get through.He'll send another.

399
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:52,605
Grey Hair will try.

400
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:57,900
Four or five,including two women,
entered the fort.

401
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:01,050
The Grey Hair's children
were under Magua's knife.

402
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,532
They escaped.

403
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,243
They will be under it again.

404
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:10,840
Why do you hate
the Grey Hair, Magua?

405
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:15,110
When the Grey Hair is dead,
Magua will eat his heart.

406
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:17,046
Before he dies,

407
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,883
Magua will put his children
under the knife,

408
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:28,020
so the Grey Hair will know his seed
is wiped out forever.

409
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:31,602
My engineers are advancing the trench
through the night.

410
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:36,607
You may have your opportunity soon.

411
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:53,260
GUARD: Miss Cora.Gentleman looking for you.
Miss Munro. Hello.

412
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:59,336
May l?

413
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:14,320
lt will seep, and then
it's going to draw.
Thank you, miss.

414
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:18,470
About done holding hands
with Miss Munro?

415
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:22,560
We got some work to do.

416
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,711
What are you looking at, sir?

417
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,756
l'm looking at you, miss.

418
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:22,463
Munro refused to
believe what happened.

419
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:25,720
He does not even
want to hear it.

420
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:29,345
Well, he's gonna have to.

421
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:33,099
Get together by
the west bastion.

422
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:38,590
lan, Sharitarish,Ongewasgone and William.

423
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:43,150
Tight weave?

424
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:47,850
Silk.Another 40 yards.

425
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,974
MUNRO: And how am l
to know it wasn't a raid
by common thieves?

426
00:48:57,059 --> 00:49:00,810
NATHANlEL: The cabin
was attacked by a war party
fighting with the French.

427
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:02,730
They're sweeping south down the frontier

428
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:04,523
attacking farms
and Mohawk villages.

429
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:05,775
All the men are stuck here.

430
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:08,694
l need proof more convincing than
this man's opinion,

431
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:11,614
before l weaken the fort's defenses
by releasing the militia.

432
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:13,991
Chingachgook's of the same opinion
about the raid.

433
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:16,077
Taken together,that's gospel.

434
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:19,038
Your fort will stand
or fall depending
on Webb's reinforcements,

435
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,623
not the presence of the colonials.

436
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:23,376
l judge military matters here,
not you.

437
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,962
Your judgment is not more important
than their right,

438
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:29,298
under agreement with Webb
to defend their farms and families.

439
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:32,720
Major Heyward was there.
He was at John Cameron's.
He saw what it was.

440
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:38,230
What exactly did you see, Major?

441
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:44,105
l saw nothing that would lead me

442
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:45,982
to the conclusion it was other than a raid

443
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:48,192
by savages bent on thievery.

444
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,860
You're a liar!

445
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,060
Major!

446
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:54,782
Montcalm is a soldier
and a gentleman,not a butcher.

447
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:55,908
Easy for you to suppose.

448
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,244
lt's their women and children alone
on the farms, not yours!

449
00:49:58,328 --> 00:49:59,870
You forget yourself, sir!

450
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,288
We're not forgetting Webb's promise.

451
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:05,001
British promises are honored,
and the militia
will not be released,

452
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:08,130
because l need more definite proof
than this man's word !

453
00:50:08,271 --> 00:50:09,296
Nathaniel's word's been good
on this frontier

454
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:10,715
a long time before you got here.

455
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:13,592
This meeting is over!
The militia stays.

456
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:16,637
Does the rule of English law
no longer govern?

457
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:19,473
Has it been replaced
by absolutism?

458
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:20,641
lf English law
cannot be trusted,

459
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:21,767
maybe these people
would do better

460
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,019
making their own peace
with the French.

461
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,186
That is sedition !

462
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:25,312
That is the truth !

463
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:27,940
l'll have you beaten
from this fort.

464
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:34,321
Someday l think you and l are gonna have
a serious disagreement.

465
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:37,283
Anyone fomenting on
advocating the leaving
of Fort William Henry

466
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,534
will be hung for sedition.

467
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:41,537
Anyone actually caught leaving will be
shot for desertion.

468
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,957
My decision is final !
Get out.

469
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,425
Cora?

470
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,056
l wanted to talk to you.

471
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:04,101
Talk with Duncan, Cora.

472
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:09,023
l must manage.l cannot be
an invalid schoolgirl.

473
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:10,107
Alice.

474
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:12,151
l'll see if Mr. Phelps
needs anything.

475
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,738
l'm sorry.
l didn't mean to. . .

476
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:20,284
Cora, when we come together
back in England

477
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:22,536
and are married and away from this place,

478
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:25,623
what had to be done and said here
will matter not at all.

479
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:26,874
l'm certain of that.

480
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:29,376
Duncan, l promised you an answer.

481
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:34,465
You've complimented me
with your persistence
and patience.

482
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:35,925
But the decision l have come to

483
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,843
is that l'd rather make
the gravest of mistakes

484
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,346
than to surrender my own judgment.

485
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:44,934
Please take this
as my final answer.

486
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:46,811
lt must be no.

487
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:50,898
l see.

488
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:50,166
lAN: Yeah, Nathaniel,
but you weren't ever for being here.

489
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:54,170
That's right.l saw it that way then
and l see it that way now.

490
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:56,046
lan, if l had kin
in the settlements,

491
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:58,007
hell be damn sure
l'd be long gone.

492
00:52:58,091 --> 00:53:00,551
What do we do about
being under Crown law?

493
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:04,388
l believe if they
set aside their law
as and when they wish,

494
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:08,267
their law no longer
has rightful authority
over us.

495
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:11,395
All they have over us
then is tyranny.

496
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:13,939
And l will not live
under that yoke.

497
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,816
So l will stay here no longer.

498
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:19,069
Anyone caught
leaving the fort
could be shot,

499
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:21,155
so each man make
your own decision.

500
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:23,574
Those who are going,
be back in an hour.

501
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:25,659
Out the northern sally port.

502
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,453
Strike for the east side
of the swamp

503
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:29,330
till you clear the French picket line.

504
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:32,666
Head north over the ridge,
then come about southeast.

505
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:36,712
Fork left in Little Meadow
and you're free of
the outpost and skirmishes.

506
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:38,964
Should've gotten
out of this long ago.

507
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:43,052
Got no families, Captain.
Figured we'd stay
and give a hand.

508
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:45,763
l'll cover you from
the top of the bastion.

509
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:47,264
You're not coming with us?

510
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:49,266
l got a reason to stay.

511
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:52,436
That reason wear a striped skirt and
work in the surgery?

512
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,687
lt does.

513
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:57,983
No offense, but it's
a better-looking reason
than you, Jack Winthrop.

514
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:02,238
Push hard,
'cause you got to clear
the French outpost by dawn.

515
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:03,822
Good luck, Jack.

516
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,457
Ongewasgone,are you staying?

517
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:14,583
Yes.

518
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,126
There's too many French.

519
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:18,087
And so few of us to fight.

520
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:22,424
Not too many to die.But we've given our word
to our English fathers.

521
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:48,172
You, sir! As you were!

522
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:54,885
Stand off.

523
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,559
Take him.

524
00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:05,910


525
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:11,028
As you were.

526
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:12,510


527
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:18,870


528
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,270


529
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:28,470


530
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:32,216
He saved us.We're alive only
because of him.

531
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,926
The man encouraged the colonials to desert,

532
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,595
in this very room,
and in my presence.

533
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:38,722
Sir.
He is guilty of sedition.

534
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:40,516
He must be tried
and hanged like any other criminal,

535
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,518
regardless of what
he did for my children.

536
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:45,270
But he knew the consequences
and he stayed.

537
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,940
Are those the actions
of a criminal?

538
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,359
Duncan, do something.

539
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:52,319
He knew the penalty for his actions.

540
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:55,197
He ought to pay
without sending you
to beg.

541
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:59,284
You know he wouldn't send me.
You falsely spoke of what you saw.

542
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:02,900
What happened at the farm
was as Nathaniel said.

543
00:59:02,988 --> 00:59:07,270
But not with enough certainty
to outweigh British interests
in this fort.

544
00:59:07,792 --> 00:59:14,466
And who empowered these colonials
to pass judgment on England's policies
in her own possessions,and to come and go
without so much as a "By your leave"?

545
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:17,469
They do not live
their lives by your leave!

546
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:20,055
They hack it out of the wilderness
with their own two hands,

547
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:21,557
bearing their children
along the way.

548
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:25,561
You are defending him because you've become
infatuated with him !

549
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:31,858
Duncan, you are a man
with a few
admirable qualities.

550
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:35,320
But taken as a whole,
l was wrong to have thought
so highly of you.

551
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:36,488
Cora!

552
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:44,329
Cora, l would do anything
l could to keep you from being hurt.

553
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:46,873
But this man is guilty
of sedition

554
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:49,334
and subject to military justice
and beyond pardon.

555
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,669
Justice?

556
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:52,504
lf that's justice,

557
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:55,173
then the sooner French guns
blow the English army out of America,

558
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,800
the better it will be
for the people here.

559
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,218
You do not know
what you're saying !
Yes, l do.

560
00:59:58,303 --> 00:59:59,636
l know exactly
what l'm saying !

561
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:03,265
And if it is sedition,
then l am guilty
of sedition too.

562
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:36,214
They're going to hang you.

563
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:42,429
Why didn't you leave
when you had the chance?

564
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:48,477
Because what l'm interested in
is right here.

565
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:51,188
What can l do?

566
01:00:51,939 --> 01:00:54,483
Webb's reinforcements
will arrive or not.

567
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:57,778
lf they do not arrive,
the fort will fall to the French.

568
01:00:57,862 --> 01:01:00,739
lf that happens,
stay close to your father.

569
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:02,991
Stay close to him.

570
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:06,828
The French officers will try
to protect the officers among the English.

571
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:09,039
No. l will find you.

572
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:10,499
Do not.

573
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:15,921
Promise me.

574
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:33,146
The whole world's
on fire.

575
01:03:02,528 --> 01:03:03,862
What is it?

576
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:07,199
Remember what l told you.

577
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:11,369
Stay close
to your father and the officers.

578
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:10,846
Colonel Munro,l have known you as
a gallant antagonist.

579
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:14,015
l am happy to make your acquaintance
as a friend.

580
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,309
And l yours,monsieur Le Marquis.

581
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:18,353
Please accept my compliments

582
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:21,773
for the strong and skillful defense
of your fortress.

583
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:23,984
Under the command of a lesser man,

584
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:26,278
it would have fallen long ago,

585
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:29,114
given the superior
numbers and materials.

586
01:04:29,907 --> 01:04:32,701
Chance has allowed me
to array against you.

587
01:04:32,785 --> 01:04:36,371
Monsieur Le Marquis,
l am a soldier,
not a diplomat.

588
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:38,623
You called this parley
for a better reason

589
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,167
than an exchange of compliments.

590
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:47,210
You have already done
everything which is necessary
for the honor of your prince.

591
01:04:47,633 --> 01:04:51,428
But now l beg you to listen to the
admonishments of humanity.

592
01:04:51,637 --> 01:04:54,723
l beg you to consider my terms
for your surrender.

593
01:04:54,807 --> 01:04:58,059
Perhaps the general's
glass can reach
as far as the Hudson

594
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:01,245
and seize the size
and eminence of
the army of Webb?

595
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:08,445
My scouts
intercepted this dispatch
intended for you.

596
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,781
Capitaine de Bougainville.

597
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:15,660
"To Colonel Munro.
Sir, l regret to inform you

598
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,039
"that l have no men available
to send to your rescue.

599
01:05:17,270 --> 01:05:21,230
"lt is quite impossible.

600
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:23,752
"l advise you to seek terms
for surrender.

601
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:27,255
"l remain. Jerome Webb
at Fort Edward."

602
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,532
This is the signature of Webb.

603
01:05:35,690 --> 01:05:38,934
And l know
the temper
of our men.

604
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:43,360
Rather than spend the war
in a French prison
hulk in Hudson Bay,
they'd fight
to the end.

605
01:05:43,397 --> 01:05:45,315
You've had your answer,
monsieur Le Marquis.

606
01:05:45,399 --> 01:05:49,277
Sir, l beg you not to sign
the death warrant of so many

607
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:52,322
until you have listened
to what l have to say.

608
01:05:57,536 --> 01:05:58,703
Go on.

609
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:02,707
None of your men
will see the inside
of a prison barge.

610
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:07,128
They are free,
so long as
they return to England

611
01:06:07,254 --> 01:06:09,506
and fight no more
on this continent,

612
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:13,218
and the civilian militia
return to their farms.

613
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:16,346
Their arms?

614
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:19,224
They may leave
the fortress fully armed.

615
01:06:20,017 --> 01:06:21,351
My colors?

616
01:06:21,727 --> 01:06:24,145
Carry them to England
with pride.

617
01:06:27,566 --> 01:06:30,151
Allow me to consult with my officers.

618
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:44,290
l have lived to see something
which l never expected.

619
01:06:44,917 --> 01:06:47,377
A British officer
afraid to support another.

620
01:06:47,461 --> 01:06:49,087
Webb can burn in hell.

621
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:52,882
And we'll go back
and dig our graves
behind those ramparts.

622
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:59,120
Death and honor are thought
to be the same,

623
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:02,350
but today l have learned that
sometimes they are not.

624
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:03,643
Sir. . .

625
01:07:15,656 --> 01:07:22,240
Monsieur Le Marquis,
l am deeply touched
by such unusual
and unexpected
generosity.

626
01:07:22,246 --> 01:07:24,497
My fort is yours
under the condition

627
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:26,791
that l be given till dawn
to bury my dead,

628
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:30,295
to prepare my men and women
for the long journey ahead

629
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:33,298
and to hand my wounded
over to your surgeons.

630
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:36,259
Granted, monsieur.

631
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:09,793
ls the hatchet buried
between the English
and my French father?

632
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:10,960
Yes.

633
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:15,300
Not a warrior has a scalp
and the white men
become friends.

634
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:17,926
My master
owns these lands,

635
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:21,679
and l have been
ordered to drive off
the English squatters.

636
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,182
They have
consented to go,

637
01:08:24,391 --> 01:08:26,768
so now l call them
enemies no longer.

638
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:30,105
Magua took the hatchet
to color with blood.

639
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:32,774
lt's still bright.

640
01:08:33,317 --> 01:08:36,111
Only when it's red,
then it will be buried.

641
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:40,448
So many suns have set
since Magua struck the war post.

642
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:42,700
And where is that sun?

643
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:44,577
Magua is the son of his people

644
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:47,205
and he has come
to lead many of them.

645
01:08:47,581 --> 01:08:51,543
But Magua has power
with his Huron people
and others here,

647

Magua's village
and lodges were burnt.

648
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:09,185
Magua's children
were killed by the English.

649
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:18,370
l was taken as slave
by the Mohawk
who fought for the Grey Hair.

650
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:24,360
Magua's wife
believed he was dead

651
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:27,287
and became
the wife of another.

652
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:32,125
The Grey Hair
was the father
of all that.

ln time,

654
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:39,799
Magua became
blood brother to the Mohawk
to become free.

655
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:43,761
But always in his heart,
he is Huron.

656
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:51,390
And his heart will be whole again
on the day

657
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:55,400

all his seed are dead.

which l must,

660
