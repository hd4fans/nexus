And the people here are gonna
join in that fight?

We'll see in the morning.
Where're you boys heading?

然後再到肯德基過冬

woman for Uncas.

69
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,400
她會說，就是你!
然後幫她生許多小孩
She will say,
"You are the one!"
Bear him many children.

70
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,440

71
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,261
才不要，你太強壯了
Never.
You're too strong.

72
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,846
這樣我會老得快
Turn me old too fast.

73
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,973
這正是他對他媽媽做的事情
That's what he's

而且有跟他們交易毛皮

77
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:04,250
現在法國人把休倫族、沃太華族
比那基族帶來我們摩和克族的土地上
Now les francais
bring Huron, Ottawa,
Abenaki onto Mohawk land.

要和法國人、休倫等族作戰
Now Mohawk will

of the Six Nations.

80
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:15,267
英王二世喬治陛下
非常感謝你們的支持
His Majesty, King George ll,
is very grateful
for your support.

81
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,643
他們還離村莊有多遠?
How far up the valley?

82
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,019
現在他們在威廉城附近
Up to Fort William Henry.

83
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,896
有兩天路程
That's two nights
and a bit from here.

84
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,274
那足以說明他們是我們的敵人!
Should be enough
to remind you all that
France is our enemy.

85
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,151
法軍是你的敵人吧..
France is your enemy.

86
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,278
你說什麼
What did you say?

87
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:29,114
如果我們走了
他們來攻擊我們的家園怎麼辦
While we're at your fort,
what if the French
attack our homes?

88
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,407
你說阿中尉
What then, Lieutenant?

89
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:33,118
這就是為了你們的家園、國家、皇上
For your homes,
for King, for country!

90
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,204
所以你們要加入戰鬥!!
That's why you men
ought to join this fight!

91
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,290
為了你們自己的頭皮
愛怎麼做是你們的事
You do what you want
with your own scalp.

92
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,709
但別支使我們怎麼做
Do not be telling us
what we ought
to do with ours.

93
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:45,010
你這叫愛國嗎
是效忠皇室的臣民嗎?!
You call yourself a patriot?
A loyal subject to the Crown?

94
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,966
我根本不承認我是英國人
l do not call myself
subject to much at all.

95
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,389
我同意一些娜珊約和約翰的話
l agree with some of what
Nathaniel and John say,

96
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,392
但英國仍然統治著我們
but l believe England's
still our sovereign.

97
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,560
我去
l'll go.

98
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,644
我也去對抗法國
We will go to
fight the French.

99
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,979
我們兄弟志願參戰
My brother and l will volunteer up.

100
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:03,482
傑克 我願和你一起作戰
l'll fight with you, Jack.

101
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,484
我要留在我的農莊上
l'm staying on my farm.

102
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,903
離開參戰的人，
歡迎他家屬來同住，
Any man who goes,
his family's welcome

103
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,738
直到戰爭結束
to fort up with us
till he comes back.

104
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,615
我的意見是
Boys, my sense of it is

105
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,576
我們有足夠的人手組織民兵應召
we have enough here
to fill the county levy,

106
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,078
我們應該參戰
and it's a fight
we ought to make.

107
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,164
但首先要跟韋伯將軍談好條件
But first
we got to get terms
from General Webb.

108
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,084
去哪跟他談呢？
Where are you
meeting him?

109
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,253
我們去亞班尼
We'll go to Albany.

110
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,376
立正!
Attention !

111
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,129
我告訴他們  沒有命令他們
We speak for the men,
not command them.

112
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,090
如果不能隨時離開戰場 回去保衛他們的家園
lf they're not allowed
leave to defend
their farms and families

113
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,717
在法軍攻擊他們時
if the French
attack the settlements,

114
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,344
那就不會有民兵加入作戰
then no colonial militia is going to
Fort William Henry.

115
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,513
你們沒有資格與英國軍隊談條件
They will report or be pressed
into service.

116
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,764
任何被挑中的男性
Any of the boys worth having

117
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,349
若敢違抗徵召，躲入森林者，
can disappear into the forest.
They will be found.

118
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,475
那會怎樣的下場呢？
And where does that leave you then?

119
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,144
他們將會被逮捕
Those men will be
found, arrested. . .

120
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:07,439
以陛下的仁慈怎麼可能有任何理由
l cannot imagine His Majesty,
in his benevolence,

121
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:11,600
去反對他在美洲的子民隨時回家
would ever object to his loyal
American subjects

122
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,779
去保衛他們的田園、女人和孩子
defending their hearth and home,
their women and children

123
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,281
這意思是說 可以讓他們隨時離開
Does that mean they
will be granted leave

124
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:19,284
能回去保衛家園是嗎?
to defend their homes if the settlements
are attacked?

125
00:10:19,472 --> 00:10:22,000
當然..
Of course.

126
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,125
那麼您已經擁有這支民兵部隊了 將軍
You got yourself a colonial militia, General.

127
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,710
那就是我們樂見的
lt is what we wanted.

128
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,508
少校鄧肯海華報到
Major Duncan Heyward reporting, sir,

129
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:40,180
我來接受派遣 路上安全嗎?
en route to Fort William Henry
and bearing dispatches. Safe journey,
l trust?

130
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:43,220
是的，安全
路上遭遇的事
Yes, and l didn't experience anything

131
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:46,140
比不上這裡的事如此使我訝異
so surprising from Bristol to Albany
as that that l witnessed here today.

132
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,228
什麼事使你訝異?
And what was that?

133
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:52,100
徵召民兵竟然還要談條件
The Crown negotiating
the terms of service.

134
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,318
我知道，
l know.

135
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:56,279
但總要有理由讓他們乖乖做事
One has to reason with these colonials
to get them to do anything.

136
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:59,190
隨然很煩但也只能如此
Tiring, isn't it?
But that's the lay of the land.

137
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:05,250
我以為大英帝國的政策是....
"世界英國化"，長官
l thought British policy is
"Make the world England," sir.

138
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:17,092
原來你是被派到威廉亨利堡去
l see you're to serve
with the 35th Regiment of Foot

139
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:21,012
加入蒙羅將軍麾下的第35步兵團
at Fort William Henry
under Colonel Munro.

140
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:27,850
我則帶領第60步兵團前往愛德華堡
l'll be marching
the 60th to Fort Edward.

141
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:32,024
跟少校解釋一下
Explain to the Major,
he has little to fear

142
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:37,410
他有點擔心那位法國將領
第一，馬奎將軍絲毫不足畏懼
from this General Marquis de Montcalm
in the first place,

143
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:41,110
所以幾乎用不到民兵助陣
and therefore scant need
of a colonial militia in the second,

144
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:44,869
第二因為法國人天生就不是打仗的料
because the French
haven't the nature for war.

145
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,706
他們只懂吃喝玩樂
Their Latinate voluptuousness

146
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,334
寧願偷懶作愛直到
火燒屁股了才要打
combines with their Gallic laziness.
And the result is,

147
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,254
他們吃喝成性勝於作戰
they'd rather eat and make love with
their faces than fight.

148
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,520
請問有沒有
蒙羅將軍女兒們的消息
Might l inquire if
General Webb has heard
from Colonel Munro's
daughters?

149
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:04,055
我正要到亞班尼去與她們會合
然後護送他們到威廉堡去
l was to rendezvous with them
in Albany and escort them
to the fort, sir.

150
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,070
嘿你...蒙羅怎麼叫你的?
You there,
what does Munro
call you?

151
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,180
那蘇格蘭佬派他的盟友....
摩和克族戰士做你的嚮導
The Scotsman has sent you
one of his Mohawk allies
to guide you.

152
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,356
馬瓜
Magua.

153
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:18,500
蘇格蘭佬的女兒在地主家
The Scotsman's daughters
are at the Poltroon's house.

154
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:23,000
我派第60團的一個連兵力護送你們
A company of the 60th
will accompany you,

155
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:25,290
馬瓜會為你們帶路
and Magua will
show you the way.

156
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:29,706
清晨六點在營地集合
到時見
Dawn. At the encampment,
6:00 a.m. sharp.
See to it you're there.

157
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,220
長官，讓我來
l'll take him
for you, sir.

158
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,518
可娜!  
Cora.

159
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,021
鄧肯!
Duncan !

160
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,774
你到這裡多久了?
How long have
you been in Albany?

161
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,317
好多天了
For days and days.

162
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,443
-你呢
And yourself?

163
00:12:58,527 --> 00:12:59,527
剛到
Just arrived.

164
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,364
天阿，見到你真好
By God,
it's good to see you.

165
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,254
我真不知該怎麼跟你說，鄧肯...
l don't know
what to say, Duncan.

166
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:27,263
我也很希望可以，但我對你的感覺...
l truly wish they did,
but my feelings don't. . .

167
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,059
無法超越友情
Don't go beyond friendship.

168
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,814
你難道看不出來嗎
Don't you see?

169
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,526
尊敬以及友情
Respect and friendship.

170
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:44,113
不正是婚姻的基石嗎
lsn't that a reasonable basis
for a man and a woman
to be married?

171
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,407
婚後自然會產生感情的
And all else may grow in time?

172
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,450
-是有人這麼說的
Some say that's the way of it.

173
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,702
-是哪些人
Some?

174
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,204
-我表哥尤金、我的父親...
Cousin Eugenie,
my father. . .

175
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,081
-好，可娜.....
Well, then, Cora.

176
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,625
我心裡很清楚如果我兩結合
ln my heart l know,
once we're joined,

177
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:58,628
一定會是倫敦最美滿的一對
we'll be the most
marvelous couple
in London.

178
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,922
這點我很肯定
l'm certain of that.

179
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,592
何不試著讓你所信賴的人
好比你的父親....
So why not let
those whom you trust,
your father,

180
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,011
來做安排呢?
help settle
what's best for you?

181
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,765
別再猶豫了....
你該試著相信他們的看法
ln view of your indecision,
you should rely
on their judgment.

182
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,100
還有我的
And mine.

183
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,604
你可以再考慮一下嗎?
Will you
consider that?

184
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:24,571
請再考慮一下好嗎?
Please consider that.

185
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,284
好吧
Yes.

186
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,871
我會再考慮的
Yes, l will.

187
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,455
鄧肯!
ALlCE: Duncan !

188
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:38,001
哇!你長高羅!
By God, you've grown up.

189
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:39,836
-我們是明天一早啟程嗎?
We leave in the morning?

190
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,004
-是的
Yes, miss.

191
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,505
我晚上要失眠了，這可是大探險
l shan't sleep tonight.

192
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,550
你有看過紅人嗎?
What an adventure. Have you seen
the red men?

193
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,177
曾看過一些
A few.

194
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:51,180
我迫不及待要告訴家鄉
的朋友
l absolutely cannot wait to return
to Portman Square,

195
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,932
這些蠻荒的歷險
having been to the wilderness.

196
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,601
我好興奮喔，鄧肯
lt's so exciting, Duncan.

197
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,656
艾麗絲??
Alice?

198
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,782
我們可以休息一下嗎?
ALlCE: Can we rest soon?

199
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,033
當然可以
DUNCAN: Absolutely.

200
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,371
你
You, there.

201
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:02,293
史考特!
我們必須停下休息，女士們累了
Scout, we must stop soon.
Women are tired.

202
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:06,480
這裡不行，再往前三里
那裡水乾淨，到那裡休息
Not here. Two leagues.
Better water. We stop there.

203
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,091
不行，就在這片空地休息
No, stop in the glade just ahead.

204
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:11,560
小姐們休息完再上路，懂嗎?
When the ladies are rested,
we will proceed. Do you understand?

205
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,263
我懂
白人跟狗一樣聽女人的

206
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:19,550
他們餓的時候  就馬上放下戰斧偷懶吃

207
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,688
你說什麼
Excuse me. What did you say?

208
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:28,480
馬瓜說.....
我很瞭解英語(英國人)，非常清楚
Magua said,
understand English very well.

209
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,267
部隊不要亂!快
DUNCAN: Hold tight!
Come on !

210
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,603
注意右翼!
Right! To the right!

211
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:30,220
原地不動，向右方射擊!

212
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:35,270
部隊!成方正對形!
預備
Prepare your firearms!
As three ranks!

213
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:39,659
-瞄準，預備
-預備
Make ready!

214
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:46,415
開火和第二排準備
First and second rank,
present!

215
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:48,668
開火
Fire!

216
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,328
不!鄧肯!
No, Duncan.

217
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,207
以防你的槍法  高過你的判斷力
ln case your aim's any better
than your judgment.

218
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,226
傷兵得送回去亞班尼，
Your wounded
should try walking
on back to Albany.

219
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,812
北面山路他們沒辦法走
They'll never make a passage north.

220
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:16,607
住手!我們需要坐騎!
Stop it! Stop it!
We need them to get out!

221
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,234
-他為何把馬放走?
DUNCAN: Why's he
loosing the horses?

222
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,944
-你問他阿!
Why don't you ask him?

223
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:23,114
很容易被追蹤
幾里外就能聽見馬叫聲
Too easy to track.
They'll be heard for miles.

224
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,159
我們要去威廉軍堡
We were headed to
Fort William Henry.

225
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:40,214
我們帶你們過去
We'll take you as far as the fort.

226
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,302
我們趕緊離開這裡
We're walking out of here fast.

227
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:55,896
除非你要等另一支休倫族殺過來
Unless all of you'd rather
wait for the next Huron
war party to come by.

228
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:13,349
史考特，我想跟你說聲謝謝
Scout, l'd like to
thank you for your help.

229
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:14,934
威廉軍堡還有多遠
How much further is it?

230
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,602
一天多腳程
Night and a bit.

231
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,771
我們好像已經擺脫他們了
Appears we're well away from them.

232
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:21,315
也許，但他們不只一夥人
Maybe. Maybe they ain't alone.

233
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,734
-那個休倫人....
That Huron captain back there. . .

234
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,444
-那個嚮導嗎?他是摩和克族人
The guide? He's a Mohawk.

235
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,655
不，他是休倫族人
No Mohawk. He's Huron.

236
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,199
-他為何要殺那女人?
What reason did he have
to murder the girl?

237
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,367
-什麼?
What?

238
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,244
黑髮那個
The dark-haired one.

239
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,496
可娜.蒙羅小姐? 殺她?
Miss Cora Munro? Murder her?

240
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,792
馬瓜從沒見過她，她才到此一個星期
He never set eyes
on her before today.
She's only been here a week.

241
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,044
-有家族仇恨嗎?來報仇的?
Blood vengeance?
A reproach or insult?

242
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,629
-當然沒有!
Of course not!

243
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,799
你們怎麼會在附近
How is it
you were so nearby?

244
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:49,427
我們發現一隊休倫殖民在跟蹤你們
Came across the war party.
Tracked them.

245
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,762
-你們是要到威廉軍堡報到的是嗎
Then you're assigned
to Fort William Henry?

246
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:52,972
-不是
No.

247
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,099
那就是到愛德華軍堡了
Fort Edward then?

248
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,018
我們往西到肯塔基
Heading west to Can-tuck-ee.

249
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:01,814
正在打仗你怎麼往西走
There is a war on.
How is it you are heading west?

250
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,444
我們大致上是往北
Well, we kind of face to the north,

251
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,529
然後在急轉向西
and real sudden-like, turn left.

252
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:13,159
我以為我們殖民地的殖民
都加入民兵戰鬥了
l thought all our colonial scouts
were in the militia.

253
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,494
現在正在北方打法國人
The militia is fighting
the French in the north !

254
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:19,165
我不是你們的殖民
我們當然也不會是民兵
l ain't your scout. And we sure ain't
in no damn militia.

255
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,550
一個渥大華族還有兩個法國人
Ottawa, two francais.

256
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,343
你說什麼
What did you say?

257
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,346
鏡子....
Mirrors,

258
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:43,517
工具.....衣服....
tools,
the clothes.

259
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,186
東西都還在屋裡
Everything
was inside.

260
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,355
-他們什麼也沒拿走
They didn't
take anything.

261
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,316
-他們走得很快
And moving fast.

262
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:52,943
是一支戰鬥隊伍
And a war party.

263
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,614
我們埋葬他們吧
Let us look after them.

264
00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:00,284
別管他們
Leave them.

265
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,703
儘管他們是陌生人
Whoever they are, though they're strangers,

266
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,289
起碼也該埋葬他們
they're at least entitled
to a Christian burial.

267
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:06,457
不能讓他們暴屍體此地
They can't be left behind.

268
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,583
-我們走   
Let us go, miss.

269
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:13,672
-我不走  我也見過打仗，
但就沒見過殘殺婦女小孩的戰爭
l will not!l've seen the face
of war before, sir,but l've not seen
war made upon women and children.

270
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,550
而你的冷血同樣這麼殘忍
And almost as cruel
is your indifference.

271
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,938
蒙羅小姐
Miss Munro,

272
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,900
他們並不是"陌生人"
they're not strangers.

273
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:38,155
我說任他們留在那裡
And they stay as they lay.

274
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:37,420
你為何不埋葬他們
Why didn't you bury those people?

275
00:28:37,756 --> 00:28:43,000
追蹤我們的人會發現掩埋痕跡
就能知道我們的蹤跡
Anyone looking for our trail
would see it as a sign we passed that way.

276
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:46,765
你和他們熟識是嗎
You knew them well?

277
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:58,944
不埋葬他們原來是為了
我們的安全著想....我道歉
You were acting for our benefit,
and l apologize.

278
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:02,260
我誤會你了
l misunderstood you.

279
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,408
這是意料中事
Well, that's to be expected.

280
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,744
-我父親曾警告過我
My father warned me about. . .

281
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,328
-你父親
Your father?

282
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,710
-金卡加，他要我小心白種女人
Chingachgook.
He warned me about people like you.

283
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,000
-喔是嗎
Oh, he did?

284
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,628
別試著去接近他們
He said, "Do not try to understand them."

285
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:21,884
也別讓他們瞭解你
Yes. And, "Do not try to make
them understand you.

286
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:26,180
“那是因為他們是一個品種  分開，毫無意義。”
"That is because they are a breed apart
and make no sense."

287
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,580
他們為什麼會退回去
Why did they turn back?

288
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,165
這裡是印地安墓地
Burial ground.

289
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,301
一個品種  分開，毫無意義
"Breed apart. We make no sense?"

290
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,347
我加註  妳是特例
ln your particular case, miss,
l'd make allowance.

291
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:52,099
非常感謝
Thank you so much.

292
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:01,191
你原本的家人呢
Where is your real family?

293
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,946
我的父母、姐妹全被殺害了
They buried my ma and pa
and my sisters.

294
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:08,031
金卡加從法國獵人手中帶我回來
Chingachgook found me
with two French trappers,

295
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,117
待我如同親生
raised me up as his own.

296
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,661
-我很遺憾
l'm sorry.

297
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:15,998
-我記不起他們了，不過一、二歲的事
l do not remember.
l wasn't but one or two.

298
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,418
你在哪裡學的英語
How did you learn English?

299
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:24,047
十歲時我父親送我和安卡斯
到鎮上教會學校學的
My father sent Uncas and l
to Reverend Wheelock's school when l was 10.

300
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:33,348
為何你的朋友要住在
這偏遠又毫無防衛的地方呢
Why were those people living
in this defenseless place?

301
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,479
他們在七年工期滿後
After seven years
indentured service

302
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,898
就來此維吉尼亞安居了
in Virginia,they headed out here

303
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:44,818
窮人也只能住得起邊疆
'cause the frontier's
the only land available
to poor people.

304
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:47,613
在這裡他們沒有負債
Out here,
they're beholden to none.

305
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,532
也不必處處受人管束
Not living by another's leave.

306
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,331
他們姓柯麥隆
The name was Cameron.

307
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,293
約翰亞力山卓柯麥隆
John and Alexandra Cameron.

308
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,364
我父親的族人曾說
當太陽、月亮兩兄弟誕生的時候
My father's people
say that at the birth of the sun,

309
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:34,864
它們的母親死了
and of his brother,
the moon,their mother died.

310
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:36,745
於是太陽就把她的遺體給了大地
So the sun gave
to the earth her body,

311
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:39,331
讓大地生長萬物生命
from which was
to spring all life.

312
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,210
又從他的胸部抽出星星
And he drew forth
from her breast
the stars.

313
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:48,382
將星星拋上夜空 以紀念她的靈魂
The stars, he threw into the night sky
to remind him of her soul.

314
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:57,349
所以那些也是紀念柯麥隆家的星星
So there's the Camerons' monument.

315
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:02,771
我想也是紀念著我的親人
My folks' too,l guess.

316
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,327
你說得對
You are right, Mr. Poe.

317
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:21,415
對這裡的狀況我們並不瞭解
We do not understand
what is happening here.

318
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,458
跟在倫敦或波士頓
And it's not as l imagined
it would be,

319
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,836
所想像的完全不同
thinking of it in Boston and London.

320
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,004
-抱歉讓你失望了
Sorry to disappoint you.

321
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,922
-不，正好相反
No, on the contrary.

322
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:35,100
這樣更能沸騰我的血液
lt is more deeply stirring
to my blood

323
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:38,098
超出我以前的任何想像
than any imagining
could possibly have been.

324
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:22,059
威堡就在下一個山脊那裡
NATHANlEL:
Top of the next ridge.
The fort's downhill of it.

325
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:27,189
團裡的弟兄們
會去那裡的湖邊取水
The men of the regiment will fetch
water from the lake,

326
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:30,484
生火取暖，供應一切所需
build fires, and provide every
comfort and desire.

327
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:35,739
我迫不及待的想見父親了
l cannot wait to see Papa.

328
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:41,781
開火
Fire!

329
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,476
準備  瞄準  開火
Prepare! Point! Fire!

330
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,774
開門
Open up.

331
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:42,736
少校鄧肯海華報到
l'm Major Duncan Heyward.

332
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,903
杰弗里隊長
Captain Jeffrey Beams.

333
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,322
-我是平斯，我以為你活不到此地
Didn't expect you
to make it through.

334
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,073
-我們去見蒙羅
Let's go to Munro.

335
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,716
-兄弟們!好嗎?
Hello, boys!

336
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,385
-娜珊約!
Nathaniel !

337
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:12,350
在這裡真是受罪
l need to talk
to you, Jack.

338
00:39:12,352 --> 00:39:15,560
-安卡斯!
-我以為你們不參戰
MAN: Uncas!
Thought you and Nathaniel
weren't joining up.

339
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:16,519
我們是沒有
We didn't.

340
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,822
-爸爸!爸爸!
Papa! Papa!

341
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:31,034
-愛麗絲、可娜，你們來做什麼?
Alice! Cora!
Why are you here?

342
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:34,079
我的援軍呢
And where the hell
are my reinforcements?

343
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,958
去請費普斯先生
Get Mr. Phelps.

344
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:45,507
我叫你們離遠一點
怎麼不聽話呢
Told you to stay away.
Why did you disobey me, girls?

345
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,801
-幾時說的?怎麼說的?
When? How? l. . .

346
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:48,968
-在我信裡說的阿
My letter.

347
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,470
-沒有信阿
There was none.

348
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:51,888
-什麼?  -沒有收到信
What?
There was no letter.

349
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,473
-我派了三個信差突圍去找偉柏
l sent three couriers
to Webb.

350
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,016
-其中一個叫做"馬瓜"對吧
DUNCAN: One called
Magua arrived.

351
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,518
-他沒有叫我們別過來
He delivered
no such message.

352
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,186
-偉柏知道我們被包圍嗎
Does Webb not even know
we are besieged?

353
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,771
偉柏不知情
Sir, Webb has no idea.

354
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:03,316
當然不會派援軍
And he certainly
does not know
to send reinforcements.

355
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:13,910
-發生了什麼事
What happened to you?

356
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:16,162
-在往喬治城的途中遇襲了
On the George Road.
Attacked.

357
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,622
我們沒事
We're fine.

358
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:20,291
-你還好嗎
-還好
Are you all right?
Yes.

359
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,961
-這裡會變成怎麼樣，爸爸
What will happen
here, Papa?

360
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,254
-我們會沒事的
We'll be all right, girl.

361
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:27,465
這個叫馬瓜的陷害我們中埋伏
死了十八個人
This Magua led us into it.
Eighteen killed.

362
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:31,870
這幾位帶我們來到這裡
These men came to our aid.
They guided us here.

363
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,500
謝謝你們
你們需要什麼嗎
Thank you.
Do you need anything?

364
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:40,478
-要幾桶火藥
Help ourselves
to a few horns
from your powder stores.

365
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:41,896
-還有乾糧
Some food.

366
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:43,606
承蒙你們這次恩情
lndebted to you.

367
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:49,237
可娜小姐，你好嗎
PHELPS: Miss Cora,
how are you?

368
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,656
費先生你好
Hello, Mr. Phelps.

369
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,533
-麥肯太太會拿乾淨的衣服給你們換
Mrs. McCann
will get some dry
clothes for you.

370
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:54,951
-謝謝
CORA: Thank you.

371
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,205
跟你姐姐去吧
Go with your sister, Alice.

372
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:05,086
沒事的孩子，
lt'll be all right, girl.

373
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,589
去吧，沒事的
lt'll be all right.

374
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,480
可以瞭解一下戰況嗎長官
Might l inquire
after the situation, sir,

375
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:27,317
我在山脊上看到法軍的工事
given that l've seen
the French engineering
from the ridge above?

376
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:31,362
情況就是對方的炮口徑大過我們
數量多過我們
The situation is,
his guns are bigger than
mine and he has more of them.

377
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:35,492
我們只能挨轟
它們的戰壕每天推進30碼
We keep our heads down
while his troops dig
30 yards of trench a day.

378
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:38,036
等進入兩百碼的的距離時
When those trenches are 200 yards 
from the fort and within range,

379
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,579
它們會裝填炸藥轟垮城牆
he'll bring in his 15-inch mortars,

380
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:43,249
把我們炸得屍骨無存
lob explosive rounds
over our walls and pound us to dust.

381
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:48,700
它們現在距離大約300碼
如果每天推進30碼
They look to be
300 yards out.

382
00:41:48,704 --> 00:41:52,870
那我們僅剩三天了
-可惡...
lf they're digging 30 yards a day,
you have three days.
Damn. Damn.

383
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:56,304
有一個人可以突圍去見韋伯
This man here can make a run
straight through to Webb.

384
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:59,349
三天時間不夠往返亞班尼
Three days is not enough time
to get to Albany and back
with reinforcements.

385
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:05,210
-不是去亞堡
兩天前韋伯已經開往愛德華堡
Webb's not in Albany.
He marched the 60th to Fort Edward two days ago.

386
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,689
韋伯在愛德華堡
Webb is at Edward?

387
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:07,815
-是的長官
Yes, sir.

388
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,400
那只有十二里路
That's only
12 miles away.

389
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:12,278
他的援軍明天就可以到達
He could have
reinforcements here
the day after tomorrow.

390
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,406
你挑選人讓敵軍轉移注意力
You, sir, pick your man.
Major Heyward will provide a diversion.

391
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:16,908
我現在寫信
l'll draft out a dispatch.

392
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:19,911
待會把告急信交給你
Captain Beams
will seek you out
and give it to you later.

393
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:23,540
還有件事，昨天我們經過
邊疆的柯麥隆一家
Something else.
Cameron's cabin.
Frontier cabin.

394
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:28,070
看見房子被燒燬 全家也被殺死
Came upon it yesterday.
lt was burnt out,everyone murdered.

395
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:30,672
是法軍盟友渥太華族干的
lt was Ottawa,
allied to the French.

396
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:35,885
知道了......
Aye.

397
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:38,721
那又怎樣呢
So?

398
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:43,935
那是一支戰鬥隊伍
lt was a war party.

399
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:47,897
表示它們會攻擊整個邊境
That means they're gonna be
attacking up and down
the frontier.

400
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:49,691
謝謝你，先生
Thank you, sir.

401
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:53,860
在這裡的磨和克族、屯墾者
都有家眷在邊境
People here,
Mohawks, settlers,
have family out there.

402
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,655
你說夠了先生
That'll be all, sir!

403
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,043
家毀人亡，無一倖免
Things were done.Nobody was spared.

404
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:16,009
個人生死事小 國家大事重要
Those considerationsare subordinate to
the interests of the Crown.

405
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:19,429
將家人生死置之度外
A terrible feature of war
here in the Americas,
Major Heyward.

406
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:22,974
以盡責打敗法國人為優先
Best keep your eye fixed on our duty,
to defeat France.

407
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:26,769
成與敗全靠這名信差了
That hangs on a courier to Webb.

408
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,795
我用三頭公牛跟你交換一頓宴席
For my children are the children
of the true faith.

409
00:43:53,800 --> 00:44:03,005
明天在營火會議前
我將與你共唱戰歌
My friendship and esteem is boundless.
Tomorrow, l will sing the war song with you
at the great council fire.

410
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:18,260
馬瓜
你的"英國朋友"們好嗎
Magua, how are things
with your English friends?

411
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:25,410
我們是一起的，加入我們
一起聽聽他的消息
We're at one.Join us.Hear what Le Subtil
has to tell us.

412
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:33,760
英國將軍韋伯跟愛德華堡
的60兵團會合了
The English war chief,
Webb, goes to Fort Edward
with 60th Regiment.

413
00:44:33,803 --> 00:44:37,680
他還不知法國主子正在攻打威堡
He does not know that my father's army
attacks Fort William Henry.

414
00:44:37,757 --> 00:44:40,291
你的任務完成了嗎
Magua was successful?

415
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:44,380
另外兩名信差死在樹林裡
The other two couriers
died in the forest.

416
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:50,770
現在蒙羅應該知道
他的信並沒有送到韋伯那裡
By now, Munro would know his dispatch
did not get through.He'll send another.

417
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:52,605
他會再派信差去
-灰頭佬會再  試的
Grey Hair will try.

418
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:57,900
有四、五個人包括兩個女人進入城堡
Four or five,including two women,
entered the fort.

419
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:01,050
灰髮佬的女兒曾險些死在我的刀下
The Grey Hair's children
were under Magua's knife.

420
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,532
但被他們溜了....
They escaped.

421
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,243
如果再落在我的刀下
They will be under it again.

422
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:10,840
馬瓜你為何這麼痛恨灰髮佬
Why do you hate
the Grey Hair, Magua?

423
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:15,110
灰髮佬死的時候...馬瓜要生吞他的心
When the Grey Hair is dead,
Magua will eat his heart.

424
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:17,046
在他死前.....
Before he dies,

425
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,883
馬瓜要在他面前殺死他的女兒
Magua will put his children
under the knife,

426
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:28,020
讓他親眼看著自己絕種
so the Grey Hair will know his seed
is wiped out forever.

427
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:31,602
我的工兵在今晚能推進壕溝
My engineers are advancing the trench
through the night.

428
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:36,607
你的機會很快就會來了
You may have your opportunity soon.

429
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:53,260
-可娜小姐，有位先生找你
-蒙羅小姐
GUARD: Miss Cora.Gentleman looking for you.
Miss Munro. Hello.

430
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:59,336
我可以拿嗎
May l?

431
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:14,320
-這藥膏能夠消炎
-謝謝
lt will seep, and then
it's going to draw.
Thank you, miss.

432
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:18,470
你跟蒙羅小姐卿卿我我夠了嗎
About done holding hands
with Miss Munro?

433
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:22,560
我們有事要做
We got some work to do.

434
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,711
你在看什麼，先生
What are you looking at, sir?

435
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,756
我在看你，小姐
l'm looking at you, miss.

436
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:22,463
蒙羅不肯相信柯麥隆家的滅門
Munro refused to
believe what happened.

437
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:25,720
他不肯聽這件事情
He does not even
want to hear it.

438
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:29,345
他一定得聽
Well, he's gonna have to.

439
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:33,099
到西邊的凌型堡集合
Get together by
the west bastion.

440
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:38,590
一定要把伊恩、沙裡、翁卡、威廉找來
lan, Sharitarish,Ongewasgone and William.

441
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:43,150
這料子織得很密
Tight weave?

442
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:47,850
絲料，射程可以增加四十碼
Silk.Another 40 yards.

443
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,974
誰知道不是土匪干的
MUNRO: And how am l
to know it wasn't a raid
by common thieves?

444
00:48:57,059 --> 00:49:00,810
甘家是被戰鬥隊伍襲擊的
是法軍的盟友干的
NATHANlEL: The cabin
was attacked by a war party
fighting with the French.

445
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:02,730
他們掃蕩了南方邊界
They're sweeping south down the frontier

446
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:04,523
襲擊農莊還有摩和克的村子
attacking farms
and Mohawk villages.

447
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:05,775
而摩和克的男人全滯留在此
All the men are stuck here.

448
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:08,694
你一個人的話不足採信
l need proof more convincing than
this man's opinion,

449
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:11,614
我也不能因此放走民兵削弱戰力
before l weaken the fort's defenses
by releasing the militia.

450
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:13,991
金卡加的意見也是相同的
Chingachgook's of the same opinion
about the raid.

451
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:16,077
他們父子的話語可抵聖經
Taken together,that's gospel.

452
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:19,038
威堡的成敗要靠援軍
Your fort will stand
or fall depending
on Webb's reinforcements,

453
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,623
而不是靠這一點民兵
not the presence of the colonials.

454
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:23,376
研判軍情的是我，不是你
l judge military matters here,
not you.

455
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,962
你的判斷權責不能超越
Your judgment is not more important
than their right,

456
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:29,298
他們保全家人、農莊的權利
under agreement with Webb
to defend their farms and families.

457
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:32,720
海華少校當時也在那裡
他也有看到
Major Heyward was there.
He was at John Cameron's.
He saw what it was.

458
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:38,230
你確實看到了什麼?少校
What exactly did you see, Major?

459
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:44,105
我所相信
l saw nothing that would lead me

460
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:45,982
我看到的是....
to the conclusion it was other than a raid

461
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:48,192
一般土匪的搶劫殺人
by savages bent on thievery.

462
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,860
-你撒謊
You're a liar!

463
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,060
少校
Major!

464
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:54,782
蒙特康是個軍人不是屠夫
Montcalm is a soldier
and a gentleman,not a butcher.

465
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:55,908
你說得簡單，
Easy for you to suppose.

466
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,244
他們的家人有難  你的沒有
lt's their women and children alone
on the farms, not yours!

467
00:49:58,328 --> 00:49:59,870
-別忘記自己的身份，先生
You forget yourself, sir!

468
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,288
-我們沒忘記韋伯將軍給我們的承諾
We're not forgetting Webb's promise.

469
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:05,001
英國人當然遵守承諾
民兵要留下是因為.....
British promises are honored,
and the militia
will not be released,

470
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:08,130
我需要比他口說更可靠的證據
because l need more definite proof
than this man's word !

471
00:50:08,271 --> 00:50:09,296
他是言重如山
Nathaniel's word's been good
on this frontier

472
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:10,715
早在你們來邊疆之前
a long time before you got here.

473
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:13,592
會議結束，民兵留下戰鬥
This meeting is over!
The militia stays.

474
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:16,637
英國法令不管用了是嗎
Does the rule of English law
no longer govern?

475
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:19,473
法令被專制取代了是嗎
Has it been replaced
by absolutism?

476
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:20,641
如果英國法律沒辦法信任
lf English law
cannot be trusted,

477
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:21,767
-也許那些殖民
maybe these people
would do better

478
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,019
應該去跟法國人講和
making their own peace
with the French.

479
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,186
-這是擾亂軍心
That is sedition !

480
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:25,312
-這是事實
That is the truth !

481
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:27,940
-我會把你打出去
l'll have you beaten
from this fort.

482
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:34,321
有一天，我想你和我會產生嚴重的分歧
Someday l think you and l are gonna have
a serious disagreement.

483
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:37,283
任何人煽動逃兵
Anyone fomenting on
advocating the leaving
of Fort William Henry

484
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,534
都會被絞死
will be hung for sedition.

485
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:41,537
任何人逃兵捉到一律槍斃
Anyone actually caught leaving will be
shot for desertion.

486
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,957
這是最後決定，出去
My decision is final !
Get out.

487
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,425
可娜
Cora?

488
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,056
我有話跟你說
l wanted to talk to you.

489
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:04,101
可娜，跟鄧肯談談吧
Talk with Duncan, Cora.

490
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:09,023
我自己來，不能這麼沒用
l must manage.l cannot be
an invalid schoolgirl.

491
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:10,107
-愛麗絲
Alice.

492
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:12,151
-我去看看費先生需不需要幫忙
l'll see if Mr. Phelps
needs anything.

493
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,738
抱歉，我不是有意的
l'm sorry.
l didn't mean to. . .

494
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:20,284
可娜，等我們遠離此地
Cora, when we come together
back in England

495
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:22,536
回英國結婚之後
and are married and away from this place,

496
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:25,623
在此做過什麼都不重要了
what had to be done and said here
will matter not at all.

497
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:26,874
這點我很肯定
l'm certain of that.

498
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:29,376
我曾答應要考慮的事情
Duncan, l promised you an answer.

499
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:34,465
你的堅持和毅力使我受寵若驚
You've complimented me
with your persistence
and patience.

500
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:35,925
但我決定
But the decision l have come to

501
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,843
我寧願抱憾終生
is that l'd rather make
the gravest of mistakes

502
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,346
也不願違背自己的判斷
than to surrender my own judgment.

503
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:44,934
請接受這個最後的答案
Please take this
as my final answer.

504
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:46,811
答案是 "不"
lt must be no.

505
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:50,898
我明白了
l see.

506
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:50,166
-娜珊約，你本來就反對組民兵
lAN: Yeah, Nathaniel,
but you weren't ever for being here.

507
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:54,170
-對，我現在還是不贊成
That's right.l saw it that way then
and l see it that way now.

508
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:56,046
如果我有親人在屯墾區，
lan, if l had kin
in the settlements,

509
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:58,007
我早就走了
hell be damn sure
l'd be long gone.

510
00:52:58,091 --> 00:53:00,551
違反軍令怎麼辦
What do we do about
being under Crown law?

511
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:04,388
我認為如果他們拋開王法
一意孤行的話
l believe if they
set aside their law
as and when they wish,

512
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:08,267
他們就無權支配我們
their law no longer
has rightful authority
over us.

513
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:11,395
他們根本是暴政
All they have over us
then is tyranny.

514
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:13,939
而我不願受暴政壓迫
And l will not live
under that yoke.

515
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,816
所以我不會留下來
So l will stay here no longer.

516
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:19,069
逃兵被抓要槍斃
Anyone caught
leaving the fort
could be shot,

517
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:21,155
個人自行決定去留
so each man make
your own decision.

518
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:23,574
要走的人一小時候此地集合
Those who are going,
be back in an hour.

519
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:25,659
從北牆的暗門出堡
Out the northern sally port.

520
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,453
走沼澤東側
Strike for the east side
of the swamp

521
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:29,330
繞過法軍警戒線
till you clear the French picket line.

522
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:32,666
再往北翻過山脊然後轉西南
Head north over the ridge,
then come about southeast.

523
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:36,712
到"小草地"之後左轉，
就可以避開法軍前哨站
Fork left in Little Meadow
and you're free of
the outpost and skirmishes.

524
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:38,964
我們早該離開這裡了
Should've gotten
out of this long ago.

525
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:43,052
隊長，我們沒家人
所以打算留下幫忙
Got no families, Captain.
Figured we'd stay
and give a hand.

526
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:45,763
我會在菱形堡掩護你們離開
l'll cover you from
the top of the bastion.

527
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:47,264
-你不走嗎
You're not coming with us?

528
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:49,266
我有留下來的理由
l got a reason to stay.

529
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:52,436
這"理由"是醫療室那個穿裙子的吧
That reason wear a striped skirt and
work in the surgery?

530
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,687
是阿，
lt does.

531
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:57,983
傑克溫斯洛
陪美女好過陪你這醜男
No offense, but it's
a better-looking reason
than you, Jack Winthrop.

532
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:02,238
動作要快，
黎明前一定要脫離法軍前哨站
Push hard,
'cause you got to clear
the French outpost by dawn.

533
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:03,822
祝你好運，傑克
Good luck, Jack.

534
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,457
-翁卡，你要留下嗎
-是的
Ongewasgone,are you staying?

535
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:14,583
是的，
Yes.

536
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,126
法軍太多了
我們的人實在太少
There's too many French.

537
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:18,087
要死守的人不多
And so few of us to fight.

538
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:22,424
我們答應英國主子留守
Not too many to die.But we've given our word
to our English fathers.

539
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:48,172
你，先生 你別動
You, sir! As you were!

540
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:54,885
Stand off.
別走過來

541
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,559
把他銬起來
Take him.

542
00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:05,910
他們為什麼抓我的白種兒子

543
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:11,028
因為我幫傑克他們離開
As you were.

544
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:12,510
別動

545
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:18,870
這不是你的戰爭
我愛你和我弟弟

546
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,270
你該馬上離開這地方

547
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:28,470
他們要對我的白種兒子怎樣

548
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:32,216
他救了我們，能活命多虧了他
He saved us.We're alive only
because of him.

549
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,926
他鼓勵民兵逃亡
The man encouraged the colonials to desert,

550
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,595
當著我的面在這裡鼓動
in this very room,
and in my presence.

551
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:38,722
他是擾亂軍心的反叛罪犯，
Sir.
He is guilty of sedition.

552
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:40,516
他該被絞死，跟大家一樣
He must be tried
and hanged like any other criminal,

553
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,518
不管他曾救過你也是一樣
regardless of what
he did for my children.

554
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:45,270
但他明知後果依然留下
But he knew the consequences
and he stayed.

555
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,940
這也算是罪犯的行徑嗎
Are those the actions
of a criminal?

556
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,359
鄧肯，說句公道話吧
Duncan, do something.

557
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:52,319
-他明知煽動罪要處絞刑
He knew the penalty for his actions.

558
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:55,197
應該勇敢受死而不是托你求情
He ought to pay
without sending you
to beg.

559
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:59,284
-你明知他沒有托我來
你隱瞞你所看到的
You know he wouldn't send me.
You falsely spoke of what you saw.

560
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:02,900
他說那農莊的情形是實情
What happened at the farm
was as Nathaniel said.

561
00:59:02,988 --> 00:59:07,270
但比不上英國在威堡的利益
是誰授權給殖民們....
But not with enough certainty
to outweigh British interests
in this fort.

562
00:59:07,792 --> 00:59:14,466
評判英國的政策，
是誰准他們未經許可擅自離營
And who empowered these colonials
to pass judgment on England's policies
in her own possessions,and to come and go
without so much as a "By your leave"?

563
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:17,469
他們不是倚靠你們而活的
They do not live
their lives by your leave!

564
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:20,055
是靠他們的雙手開墾蠻荒而生存
They hack it out of the wilderness
with their own two hands,

565
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:21,557
忍受他自己的孩子生處孤獨
bearing their children
along the way.

566
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:25,561
是你對他迷戀 所以才幫他辯護
You are defending him because you've become
infatuated with him !

567
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:31,858
鄧肯，你很難讓人欽佩你
評量你整個人上下
Duncan, you are a man
with a few
admirable qualities.

568
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:35,320
過去我真是高估你了
But taken as a whole,
l was wrong to have thought
so highly of you.

569
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:36,488
-可娜
Cora!

570
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:44,329
可娜
我願盡最大努力不讓你傷心
Cora, l would do anything
l could to keep you from being hurt.

571
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:46,873
但這個人犯了軍法
But this man is guilty
of sedition

572
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:49,334
為了正義他罪無可恕!
and subject to military justice
and beyond pardon.

573
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,669
正義?
Justice?

574
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:52,504
如果那是正義
lf that's justice,

575
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:55,173
那麼法國越快打敗英國美洲的人民
then the sooner French guns
blow the English army out of America,

576
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,800
就越快有好日子過
the better it will be
for the people here.

577
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,218
你不知道自己在說什麼
You do not know
what you're saying !
Yes, l do.

578
00:59:58,303 --> 00:59:59,636
-我很清楚我在說什麼!
l know exactly
what l'm saying !

579
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:03,265
如果這叫擾亂軍心
那麼我也有罪
And if it is sedition,
then l am guilty
of sedition too.

580
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:36,214
他們要吊死你
They're going to hang you.

581
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:42,429
你有機會為什麼不走
Why didn't you leave
when you had the chance?

582
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:48,477
因為這裡還有我感興趣的東西
Because what l'm interested in
is right here.

583
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:51,188
我能為你做什麼
What can l do?

584
01:00:51,939 --> 01:00:54,483
不知道韋伯的援軍會不會來
Webb's reinforcements
will arrive or not.

585
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:57,778
如果沒來此地會被法軍攻陷
lf they do not arrive,
the fort will fall to the French.

586
01:00:57,862 --> 01:01:00,739
如果被攻陷了
你要緊跟著你父親走
lf that happens,
stay close to your father.

587
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:02,991
緊跟著他
Stay close to him.

588
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:06,828
法軍不會為難軍官的
The French officers will try
to protect the officers among the English.

589
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:09,039
不，我要去找你
No. l will find you.

590
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:10,499
-不要
Do not.

591
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:15,921
答應我
Promise me.

592
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:33,146
全世界都在毀滅是不是
The whole world's
on fire.

593
01:03:02,528 --> 01:03:03,862
怎麼樣了
What is it?

594
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:07,199
記住我的話
Remember what l told you.

595
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:11,369
緊跟著你父親和軍官
Stay close
to your father and the officers.

596
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:10,846
蒙羅將軍
我深知您是位英勇的敵手
Colonel Munro,l have known you as
a gallant antagonist.

597
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:14,015
很高興有機會成為您的的朋友
l am happy to make your acquaintance
as a friend.

598
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,309
悉聽差遣
And l yours,monsieur Le Marquis.

599
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:18,353
對於貴軍的戰術和頑強的防禦
Please accept my compliments

600
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:21,773
請接受我的讚揚
for the strong and skillful defense
of your fortress.

601
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:23,984
若不是由您來指揮的話
Under the command of a lesser man,

602
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:26,278
這座要塞早已被攻下
it would have fallen long ago,

603
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:29,114
由於優越的數字和材料
given the superior
numbers and materials.

604
01:04:29,907 --> 01:04:32,701
亦給了我與您抗衡的機會...
Chance has allowed me
to array against you.

605
01:04:32,785 --> 01:04:36,371
馬奎將軍，我是一個軍人
不是外交家
Monsieur Le Marquis,
l am a soldier,
not a diplomat.

606
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:38,623
冠冕堂皇的話
You called this parley
for a better reason

607
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,167
可以不必多說
than an exchange of compliments.

608
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:47,210
您已經為了您的皇室付出一切努力
現在為了人道的立場
You have already done
everything which is necessary
for the honor of your prince.

609
01:04:47,633 --> 01:04:51,428
我求您接收我的條件投降
But now l beg you to listen to the
admonishments of humanity.

610
01:04:51,637 --> 01:04:54,723
我求您考慮我提的條件
l beg you to consider my terms
for your surrender.

611
01:04:54,807 --> 01:04:58,059
或許我們也可以繼續作戰
Perhaps the general's
glass can reach
as far as the Hudson

612
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:01,245
直到韋伯將軍的援軍趕到
and seize the size
and eminence of
the army of Webb?

613
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:08,445
我的殖民截到
您派出信差的一份文件
My scouts
intercepted this dispatch
intended for you.

614
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,781
在此回覆你的請求
蒙羅將軍
Capitaine de Bougainville.

615
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:15,660
我並沒有多餘的兵力
可以支援你..
"To Colonel Munro.
Sir, l regret to inform you

616
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,039
而且不可能派得出來
"that l have no men available
to send to your rescue.

617
01:05:17,270 --> 01:05:21,230
建議你提出條件投降
"lt is quite impossible.

618
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:23,752
這是我的回覆
"l advise you to seek terms
for surrender.

619
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:27,255
偉柏簽署於愛德華堡
"l remain. Jerome Webb
at Fort Edward."

620
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,532
是韋伯的簽名
This is the signature of Webb.

621
01:05:35,690 --> 01:05:38,934
我瞭解我們弟兄們的個性
寧願戰死也不願意到
And l know
the temper
of our men.

622
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:43,360
哈德遜灣霍克監獄當戰犯
Rather than spend the war
in a French prison
hulk in Hudson Bay,
they'd fight
to the end.

623
01:05:43,397 --> 01:05:45,315
你聽到答覆了，將軍!
You've had your answer,
monsieur Le Marquis.

624
01:05:45,399 --> 01:05:49,277
我求您
在簽下眾多軍士的死亡命令之前
Sir, l beg you not to sign
the death warrant of so many

625
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:52,322
至少聽我把話說完
until you have listened
to what l have to say.

626
01:05:57,536 --> 01:05:58,703
繼續
Go on.

627
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:02,707
您的部隊沒有人會是囚犯
None of your men
will see the inside
of a prison barge.

628
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:07,128
只要都回到英國去
他們是完全自由的
They are free,
so long as
they return to England

629
01:06:07,254 --> 01:06:09,506
不必留在美國打仗了
and fight no more
on this continent,

630
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:13,218
民兵也都可以回歸田里家園
and the civilian militia
return to their farms.

631
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:16,346
武裝呢?     
Their arms?

632
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:19,224
他們仍能全副武裝
They may leave
the fortress fully armed.

633
01:06:20,017 --> 01:06:21,351
我的國旗與制服呢?
My colors?

634
01:06:21,727 --> 01:06:24,145
您可以光榮地帶回英國去
Carry them to England
with pride.

635
01:06:27,566 --> 01:06:30,151
請讓我和同僚商量一下
Allow me to consult with my officers.

636
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:44,290
我從不預期 活著能看到一些東西
l have lived to see something
which l never expected.

637
01:06:44,917 --> 01:06:47,377
英國官員不敢支持另一個
A British officer
afraid to support another.

638
01:06:47,461 --> 01:06:49,087
韋伯真該下地獄!
Webb can burn in hell.

639
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:52,882
我們回城裡去跟他們一決死戰
And we'll go back
and dig our graves
behind those ramparts.

640
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:59,120
死亡和榮譽常被想成是
相同的一件事
Death and honor are thought
to be the same,

641
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:02,350
但今天我學習到不同的見解
but today l have learned that
sometimes they are not.

642
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:03,643
長官...
Sir. . .

643
01:07:15,656 --> 01:07:22,240
馬奎將軍
我被您超凡的紳士情操
深深感動
Monsieur Le Marquis,
l am deeply touched
by such unusual
and unexpected
generosity.

644
01:07:22,246 --> 01:07:24,497
城堡交給您
條件是
My fort is yours
under the condition

645
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:26,791
在黎明前讓我
埋葬弟兄們的遺體
that l be given till dawn
to bury my dead,

646
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:30,295
以及所有眷屬
準備好長途行軍
to prepare my men and women
for the long journey ahead

647
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:33,298
並且請您的醫生不吝
醫治我們的傷患
and to hand my wounded
over to your surgeons.

648
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:36,259
我同意，蒙羅將軍
Granted, monsieur.

649
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:09,793
英國人和我的法國主子
之間的戰斧已經掩埋了是嗎
ls the hatchet buried
between the English
and my French father?

650
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:10,960
對   戰士們不再割頭皮了
Yes.

651
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:15,300
因為白人們已經成為朋友了
Not a warrior has a scalp
and the white men
become friends.

652
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:17,926
我的主人(法皇)已經擁有這塊土地
My master
owns these lands,

653
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:21,679
我奉命來驅逐非法殖民
and l have been
ordered to drive off
the English squatters.

654
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,182
英國人已同意離開
They have
consented to go,

655
01:08:24,391 --> 01:08:26,768
他們不再是我的敵人了
so now l call them
enemies no longer.

656
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:30,105
馬瓜說好要用鮮血染紅戰斧
Magua took the hatchet
to color with blood.

657
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:32,774
但至今戰斧還是白的
lt's still bright.

658
01:08:33,317 --> 01:08:36,111
除非染上他們的鮮血
才能停止怨恨
Only when it's red,
then it will be buried.

659
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:40,448
這麼多的日子以來
So many suns have set
since Magua struck the war post.

660
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:42,700
馬瓜幫著法國攻打英軍
And where is that sun?

661
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:44,577
何時才能復仇雪恨
我是族人的孩子
Magua is the son of his people

662
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:47,205
-努力不懈的當上了領袖
-你已然有權利
and he has come
to lead many of them.

663
01:08:47,581 --> 01:08:51,543
帶領休倫族和其他盟族
But Magua has power
with his Huron people
and others here,

664
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:53,211
我知道
l know well.

665
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:03,847
馬瓜的村子和屋子
被英國佬燒光了
Magua's village
and lodges were burnt.

666
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:09,185
馬瓜的孩子 被英國佬殺死了
Magua's children
were killed by the English.

667
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:18,370
我被抓去給那些為灰髮佬
打仗的摩和克人  作為奴隸
l was taken as slave
by the Mohawk
who fought for the Grey Hair.

668
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:24,360
馬瓜的妻子以為他死了
Magua's wife
believed he was dead

669
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:27,287
所以成為了別人的老婆
and became
the wife of another.

670
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:32,125
而灰髮佬就是原凶
The Grey Hair
was the father
of all that.

671
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:33,835
當時
ln time,

672
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:39,799
馬瓜跟摩和克族人稱兄道弟
獲得了自由
Magua became
blood brother to the Mohawk
to become free.

673
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:43,761
但在他心裡永遠都是休倫族
But always in his heart,
he is Huron.

674
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:51,390
而他心裡的創傷
And his heart will be whole again
on the day

675
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:55,400
只能在灰髮佬和他的子嗣
被滅絕了的時候才能痊癒
the Grey Hair and
all his seed are dead.

676
01:09:56,150 --> 01:10:02,110
駐加拿大總司令..你...
會相信英國人的條件嗎?
Does the chief of the Canadas
believe the English will keep the terms?

677
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:05,092
我擔心我讓他們走了之後
l fear having let them go,
which l must,

678
01:10:05,170 --> 01:10:13,140
我必須再和同一批軍人作戰
.......當我將大軍
開拔往亞班尼的時候
l will only fight the same men again
when l drive towards Albany.

679
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:18,213
但我不能破壞投降協定
But l cannot break
the term of the surrender

680
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:20,840
這會使法國蒙羞
and sully
the lilies of France.

681
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,259
先生，城堡是你的了
Monsieur,
the fort is yours.

682
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:25,817
左三排  準備
MAN: Left three ranks,
make ready!

683
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,985
瞄準
Aim, set.

684
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:04,582
開火
Fire!

685
01:16:52,524 --> 01:16:54,900
現在  開火
Present, fire!

686
01:16:58,196 --> 01:17:02,074
開火
Fire!

687
01:17:05,829 --> 01:17:07,371
全線射擊
Full company!

688
01:17:29,186 --> 01:17:31,145
灰髮佬! 我要你在死前知道
Grey Hair,
before you die,

689
01:17:31,229 --> 01:17:34,148
我會把刀架在你的子孫前
know that l will put under the knife
your children,

690
01:17:34,232 --> 01:17:36,692
把你的子孫斬盡殺絕
so l will wipe your seed
from the Earth forever.

691
01:18:04,137 --> 01:18:05,763
放開她
Leave her alone!

692
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:05,620
等你再落入英國人手裡
我會親手吊死你!
When you fall into
British hands again,
l'll have you hanged !

693
01:20:14,518 --> 01:20:15,726
快一些!
Faster!

694
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:29,907
向那條河流走
Head to the river!

695
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:44,917
我們要去那裡?    哪裡也不去
DUNCAN: Where are we going?
Nowhere.

696
01:22:45,001 --> 01:22:46,168
我不明白  
l don't understand.

697
01:22:46,252 --> 01:22:48,045
待在這裡直到我們離開
This is as far as we go.

698
01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:49,421
如果我們好運
他們會發現我們上岸
lf we're lucky,
they'll figure we beached

699
01:22:49,506 --> 01:22:51,298
我們的獨木舟交錯在地
our canoes and headed cross land.

700
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:53,801
如果非常好運
他們也會以為我們跌下瀑布
lf we're very lucky,
they'll figure we went over the falls.

701
01:22:53,885 --> 01:22:55,970
唯一的希望是
他們超前我們而去
Our only hope is
that they pass us by.

702
01:22:56,054 --> 01:22:57,346
如果是的話然後呢?
lf they do?

703
01:22:57,430 --> 01:22:59,640
我們就沿著山的南邊走
Take the south rim
down the mountain.

704
01:22:59,724 --> 01:23:02,434
只離愛德華城十二里
lt's 12 miles cross country
to Fort Edward.

705
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:04,144
如果他們不上當呢?
And if they don't?

706
01:23:05,397 --> 01:23:08,607
你就沒機會享受吊死我的樂趣了
You'll just have to forego
the pleasure of hanging me.

707
01:23:13,571 --> 01:23:14,738
火藥呢?
Powder?

708
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:26,208
沒了!
Gone.

709
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:31,430
我的全濕了
Mine's soaking wet!

710
01:23:31,548 --> 01:23:32,965
我們的父親
CORA: Our father. . .

711
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:36,427
你有看見他嗎?
Did you see my father?

712
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:39,430
遠遠看見了
From a distance.

713
01:24:10,128 --> 01:24:11,962
不要告訴愛麗絲
Say nothing to Alice.

714
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:35,986
退後!
Get back!
(GASPS)

715
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:32,950
是! 去吧
Yes! Go ahead !

716
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:35,337
這是什麼狗屁計劃?
What the bloody hell
plan is this?

717
01:25:35,421 --> 01:25:36,463
我要你走!
l want you to go!

718
01:25:36,548 --> 01:25:39,299
如果我走，還有一點機會
現在無法還擊
lf we go, there's a chance
there won't be a fight.

719
01:25:39,384 --> 01:25:40,985
因為沒有火藥
There's no powder.lf we don't go in that,
there's no chance.

720
01:25:40,990 --> 01:25:44,680
如果我不走
就完全沒有機會明白嗎?
None! You understand?

721
01:25:44,764 --> 01:25:45,973
懦夫!
Coward !

722
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:49,393
你必須盡力去做   救你自己
You've done everything you can do.
Save yourself!

723
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:53,981
如遇厄運
lf the worst happens. . .

724
01:25:54,065 --> 01:25:55,607
你要生存下去
You stay alive!

725
01:25:56,234 --> 01:26:00,154
如果他們沒有殺你
lf they don't kill you,
they'll take you north
up to the Huron lands.

726
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:05,480
會帶你往北到休倫族的地盤
順從他們，你聽到沒?
你要堅強!你要生存下去!
Submit, do you hear?
You're strong.
You survive!

727
01:26:05,618 --> 01:26:09,470
要活下去! 無論多艱難!
You stay alive,

728
01:26:09,789 --> 01:26:11,415
我都會找到你!

我都會找到你!

731
01:32:04,602 --> 01:32:06,186
你們的戰斧紅了．．．

732
01:32:08,410 --> 01:32:13,170
殺了許多英國人，偉大的酋長

733
01:32:13,410 --> 01:32:15,380
馬瓜成了偉大的戰鬥首領

734
01:32:15,410 --> 01:32:17,570
希望得到你的承認

735
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:30,460
現在我帶來了三個犯人獻給你

736
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:36,460
馬瓜會將英國軍官賣給法國人

737
01:32:36,510 --> 01:32:40,470
我所得的酬勞都會獻給你

738
01:32:41,510 --> 01:32:47,470
這倆女人是白人指揮官蒙羅的女兒

739
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:56,480
她們將會被燒死
讓大家共享這份榮耀

740
01:33:53,002 --> 01:33:54,628
我不會說休倫語
你會說法語嗎?少校
l don't speak Huron.
Do you speak French, Major?

741
01:33:54,712 --> 01:33:55,795
是的
Yes.

742
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:58,798
替我翻譯成法文每一個字都要!
Translate for meinto French
every word as l say it.

743
01:33:58,883 --> 01:34:02,969
我沒有武裝是為和平而來
l come to you unarmed
and in peace 

744
01:34:02,990 --> 01:34:04,460
求你聽我陳述事實
to unstuff your ears, Sachem.

745
01:34:04,513 --> 01:34:07,474
請您讓蒙羅將軍的女兒走
Let the children of
the dead Colonel Munro
go free.

746
01:34:07,558 --> 01:34:08,975
不要再加深英國人的仇恨
Take fire out of
the English anger

747
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:10,644
他們極其痛恨殺害婦幼的人
over the murder of
their helpless ones.

748
01:34:12,855 --> 01:34:14,189
法國主子和我們
比英國人還要強大

749
01:34:17,610 --> 01:34:22,270
我們不怕英國人的怒火

750
01:34:22,365 --> 01:34:26,701
大酋長，法國人製造的和平
被馬瓜破壞了
Sachem, the French fathers
made peace.Magua broke it.

751
01:34:26,786 --> 01:34:29,454
法國人將不再與休倫族做朋友
lt is false that the French
will be friends
still to the Huron.

752
01:34:29,622 --> 01:34:30,997
法國主子會很高興
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH)

753
01:34:31,620 --> 01:34:37,580
不必再擔心和同一支英軍交戰

754
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:55,015
當白人來的時候
也為我們的命運帶來黑暗

755
01:34:57,130 --> 01:35:04,090
自我還小的時候
族人就常被問到這個問題

756
01:35:04,140 --> 01:35:06,810
休倫族會怎樣做?

757
01:35:10,079 --> 01:35:12,789
現在，連法國人也怕休倫族了
不是更好?

759
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:20,600
當休倫族在法國人的恐懼中
更顯強大時

760
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:24,360
我們就可以和他們重新建立協約

761
01:35:24,650 --> 01:35:27,620
我們將會與白人平起平坐

762
01:35:27,650 --> 01:35:33,610
拿亞班奇的土地
奧瑟人的、索克人的狐狸與毛皮

763
01:35:33,660 --> 01:35:37,620
來換取黃金

764
01:35:37,660 --> 01:35:42,630
不會比白人少
會跟白人一樣強大

765
01:35:42,670 --> 01:35:48,330
馬瓜會用這些
英國人和法國人的殖民手段嗎?
Would Magua use the ways
of les francais and the Yengeese?

766
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:49,951
會嗎?
Would you?
Yes!

767
01:35:50,035 --> 01:35:52,412
休倫族會不會用白蘭地
愚弄阿爾金族的弟兄...
會!
Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers
foolish with brandy

768
01:35:52,496 --> 01:35:56,746
然後搶奪他的土地
賣給白人換黃金呢?
and steal his lands to sell them for gold
to the white man?

769
01:35:56,751 --> 01:36:01,650
休倫族只想貪婪更多的土地是嗎?
Would Huron have greed for more land
than a man can use?

770
01:36:01,672 --> 01:36:03,047
休倫族會不會愚弄塞內卡族
Would Huron fool Seneca
into taking

771
01:36:03,132 --> 01:36:04,924
搶走所有毛皮
all the furs of all the animals
of the forest

772
01:36:05,009 --> 01:36:07,594
去換取貝珠錢和烈酒呢?
for beads
and strong whiskey?

773
01:36:07,678 --> 01:36:11,264
休倫族人是要殺光敵人的
女人與孩子是嗎?
Those are the ways of the Yengeese
and the francais traders

774
01:36:11,348 --> 01:36:15,310
這些就是英國人和法國人
對付殖民地居民的....
and their masters in Europe infected
with the sickness of greed.

775
01:36:15,700 --> 01:36:19,620

他們歐洲主子早已病態般貪婪
Magua's heart is twisted.

776
01:36:19,857 --> 01:36:24,470
馬瓜的內心已經扭曲
他要學使他扭曲的白人一樣
He would make himself
into what twisted him.

of Chingachgook of the Mohican people.

779
01:36:30,367 --> 01:36:31,659
放走這小孩吧
Let the children of the dead Munro

請放走女人和英國軍官吧

01:37:14,870 --> 01:37:20,840
英國軍官回去英軍陣營

01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:28,830
蒙羅的黑髮女兒將會被燒死
