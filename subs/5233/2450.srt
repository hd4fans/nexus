with the police

292
00:17:19,402 --> 00:17:22,405
Now, as a favor,
I had him look at your case

293
00:17:22,405 --> 00:17:25,909
He say you ain't got shit to
worry about. They just fuckin' with you

294
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:29,902
So we're gonna sic
the junkyard dog on their ass
and make 'em stop fuckin' with you

295
00:17:31,881 --> 00:17:34,117
- Good lookin' out, man.
Good lookin' out.
- Hmm? Mm-hmm

296
00:17:34,117 --> 00:17:36,986
- Come on in, man, and let's celebrate.
- No, no. Uh-uh

297
00:17:36,986 --> 00:17:39,556
Look here, I'm really
supposed to be somewhere

298
00:17:39,556 --> 00:17:43,549
Matter of fact, I was kind of hoping
you could come run with me

299
00:17:43,593 --> 00:17:45,595
What you mean?

300
00:17:45,595 --> 00:17:47,597
You know, man

301
00:17:47,597 --> 00:17:50,600
I hate to be the kind of nigger
that do a nigger a favor

302
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,936
then bam¡­ hit the nigger up
for a favor in return

303
00:17:52,936 --> 00:17:55,004
but I gots to be
that kind of nigger

304
00:17:55,004 --> 00:17:58,508
- What? What you want?
- I need a favor, nigger

305
00:17:58,508 --> 00:18:01,511
- That requires me to go out tonight?
- Just a bit

306
00:18:01,511 --> 00:18:04,447
Aw, man, I wasn't plannin'
on goin' no place tonight

307
00:18:04,447 --> 00:18:08,017
It is late as hell, man.
I'm home, I'm high, man. Come on

308
00:18:08,017 --> 00:18:10,753
Uh-huh.
And why are you home, huh?

309
00:18:10,753 --> 00:18:14,746
You home because I spent $10,000
to get your ass home

310
00:18:15,091 --> 00:18:19,095
Now, look, I got a little problem,
all right?

311
00:18:19,095 --> 00:18:21,698
I need some help,
and you can help me out

312
00:18:21,698 --> 00:18:24,200
Go in the house and throw some shit on.
Let's walk out to the car

313
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,193
Come on

314
00:18:28,972 --> 00:18:31,541
I'm ready, man. What's your problem?
There ain't no problem

315
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,543
It's more like
a situation

316
00:18:33,543 --> 00:18:37,536
You remember them three
M-60 machine guns I sold
last year outta the five I got?

317
00:18:37,881 --> 00:18:40,817
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm gonna sell
the other two tonight

318
00:18:40,817 --> 00:18:44,810
There's this group of Koreans
over in Koreatown startin' this
little Neighborhood Watch thing

319
00:18:45,555 --> 00:18:49,548
They need some weapons so they
can show the neighborhood niggers
they mean business

320
00:18:49,792 --> 00:18:53,785
Now, I'm gonna sell them the other
two machine guns, all right?

321
00:18:53,863 --> 00:18:57,200
The problem is, I ain't never done
business with these Koreans before

322
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,203
I ain't worried, 'cause by and large
Asians are very dependable

323
00:19:00,203 --> 00:19:02,205
They don't want no trouble

324
00:19:02,205 --> 00:19:04,541
You might argue with them
about price and shit

325
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,943
but you ain't gotta worry about
them shootin' you in the back

326
00:19:06,943 --> 00:19:08,945
But I got me a rule:

327
00:19:08,945 --> 00:19:12,949
Never do business with people
you ain't never done business
with before without backup

328
00:19:12,949 --> 00:19:15,685
That's why I need you.
Backup

329
00:19:15,685 --> 00:19:19,678
Look, all you've got to do is lay in
here and hold on to this motherfucker

330
00:19:20,757 --> 00:19:24,160
All right? I'm gonna tell 'em I'm goin'
in the trunk to show 'em the goods

331
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,163
When I open the trunk, you pop up
and rack this motherfucker

332
00:19:27,163 --> 00:19:29,165
Man, fuck that shit.
I ain't for shootin' nobody

333
00:19:29,165 --> 00:19:31,167
I ain't said nothin'
about you shootin' nobody

334
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:33,836
All you gotta do is hold on to it.
They'll get the idea

335
00:19:33,836 --> 00:19:37,307
You must be out of your mind
if you think I'm gonna get
in this dirty-ass trunk

336
00:19:37,307 --> 00:19:39,709
We ain't goin' nowhere
but to Koreatown, man

337
00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:41,844
You ain't gonna be in here
no more than ten minutes

338
00:19:41,844 --> 00:19:45,715
I ain't ridin' in
no trunk for no minute.
Why can't I ride up front with you?

339
00:19:45,715 --> 00:19:48,718
You can't ride up front with me.
The surprise element is 90% of it

340
00:19:48,718 --> 00:19:52,188
I'm sorry, man, but I ain't
gettin' in no goddamn trunk

341
00:19:52,188 --> 00:19:54,991
- I can't believe you'd do me like this.
- Do you like what, man?

342
00:19:54,991 --> 00:19:58,595
I just ain't climbing in no goddamn,
dirty-ass trunk, man

343
00:19:58,595 --> 00:20:00,597
I got a problem
with small places

344
00:20:00,597 --> 00:20:03,733
I got a problem with spending
$10,000 on ungrateful niggers
to get them out of jail

345
00:20:03,733 --> 00:20:05,735
but I did it

346
00:20:05,735 --> 00:20:07,737
How small was that
jail cell, motherfucker?

347
00:20:07,737 --> 00:20:11,007
- I know I owe you,
you got to bring all this up.
- Then get your ass in this trunk

348
00:20:11,007 --> 00:20:15,000
I want to help you, but I won't be
locked in no goddamn trunk of no car

349
00:20:15,178 --> 00:20:18,181
You think I wanted to spend
$10,000 on your ass, huh?

350
00:20:18,181 --> 00:20:21,017
- I know you helped me out.
- Do you think I wanted to spend
$10,000 on your ass?

351
00:20:21,017 --> 00:20:23,586
- Yes or no?
- Of course you didn't,
but look, in the trunk?

352
00:20:23,586 --> 00:20:26,823
That's the only way I could help you,
right? So that's what I did

353
00:20:26,823 --> 00:20:30,560
Now, look, man, all I'm asking
you to do is get in the trunk

354
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,763
hold this fuckin' shotgun,
point it at these Buddha-heads
when I open it, all right?

355
00:20:33,763 --> 00:20:37,767
- You're catching a nigger
off-guard with this shit.
- Look here. I tell you what

356
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:40,069
When we get through fucking
with these Koreans

me and you go to Roscoe's
Chicken and Waffles on me

358
00:20:43,706 --> 00:20:45,708

where he was gonna have to
do ten years in prison

435
00:26:02,591 --> 00:26:04,627
That's what he did

436
00:26:04,627 --> 00:26:06,929
And if you
know Beaumont

437
00:26:06,929 --> 00:26:10,900
you know there ain't no goddamn way
he can do ten years

438
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:14,893
If you know that,
then you know Beaumont's
gonna do anything Beaumont can¡­

439
00:26:15,604 --> 00:26:18,107
to keep from doin'
them ten years

is a clear-cut case¡­

if you gonna come in
on this thing with me

a little cheese-eatin' nigger
like this fuck that up?

455

You best think again

456

Before I let that happen,
I'll shoot this nigger in the head¡­

Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargas,
L.A.P.D

465
00:27:46,162 --> 00:27:49,432
- Can I ask what you have in that bag?
- The usual stuff

466
00:27:49,432 --> 00:27:52,234
You know, I'm a flight
attendant for Cabo Air

467
00:27:52,234 --> 00:27:55,304
- Can I help out here?
- Who's this?

468
00:27:55,304 --> 00:27:58,641
Sorry, this is Special Agent Ray Nicolet
with Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms

469
00:27:58,641 --> 00:28:02,634
- Oh, yeah? May I see some I.D.?
- Yeah. Sure

470
00:28:04,213 --> 00:28:06,715
Would you mind if we just
took a look in that bag?

471
00:28:06,715 --> 00:28:09,585
Do I mind?
Do I have a choice?

472
00:28:09,585 --> 00:28:12,588
- Yeah. You have the right to say no.
- No

473
00:28:12,588 --> 00:28:15,224
I have the right to make you wait here
with Ray while I go get a warrant

474
00:28:15,224 --> 00:28:18,227
If I don't want to go to
all that trouble, I'd just
take you in on suspicion now

475
00:28:18,227 --> 00:28:22,098
- Suspicion of what?
- Uh, could I say something?

476
00:28:22,098 --> 00:28:24,733
He just wants to peek
inside the bag for a minute

477
00:28:24,733 --> 00:28:28,370
I'll keep my eye on him
so he doesn't take anything

478
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:31,507
- Go ahead.
- Thanks a lot

You have a good flight?

481
00:28:38,681 --> 00:28:42,485
It's a shitty flight down to Cabo.
I went down there one time
with Susan, my wife

482
00:28:42,485 --> 00:28:46,478
Fuckin' turbulence
was unbelievable

[Laughs]
Goddamn

486
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,509
I'd say there's
about, oh, uh

487
00:29:06,509 --> 00:29:09,245
$50,000 here

488
00:29:09,245 --> 00:29:11,580
What would you say, Ray?

489
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:15,573
Looks like about 50,000
from here

490
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:20,723
- Is this your money?
- What if I say no?

491
00:29:20,723 --> 00:29:24,460
You should know if you bring in anything
over 10,000,you have to declare it

492
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:27,196
You forget, or what?

493
00:29:27,196 --> 00:29:31,189
You can get a $250,000 fine,
plus two years in prison

494
00:29:31,567 --> 00:29:35,404
You want to talk to us about this,
or do you want to talk to Customs?

495
00:29:35,404 --> 00:29:37,740
- I'm not sayin' another word.
- Jackie¡­

I hope you don't mind
if I call you Jackie

497
00:29:40,676 --> 00:29:44,580
Those guys down in Customs?
They're a bunch of pricks.
Excuse me, but they are

498
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:48,573
There's something about
that job makes those people
really hard to get along with

499
00:29:49,351 --> 00:29:51,754
You can go down and talk
with those guys¡­

500
00:29:51,754 --> 00:29:55,257
who are really suspicious
and really disagreeable human beings

501
00:29:55,257 --> 00:29:59,250
or you can talk with a couple of
good-hearted guys like Mark and myself

00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:05,723
It's up to you

503
00:30:06,235 --> 00:30:10,239
[Dargas] Let's take a look here
at the file on Jacqueline Brown

504
00:30:10,239 --> 00:30:13,876
According to this, this isn't the
first time you've run afoul of the law

505
00:30:13,876 --> 00:30:17,279
In 1985, while
a stewardess for Delta,

506
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,515
you were busted while
carrying drugs for a pilot?

507
00:30:19,515 --> 00:30:21,917
That pilot was my husband,
and I got off

508
00:30:21,917 --> 00:30:24,653
You mean they offered you a deal,
and you grabbed it

509
00:30:24,653 --> 00:30:28,557
- He did time, you did probation.
- [Siren Wails]

510
00:30:28,557 --> 00:30:31,694
I didn't hear you ask permission
to smoke in my office

511
00:30:31,694 --> 00:30:34,230
- May I smoke?
- No, you may not

512
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:36,665
So you get off
with a slap on the wrist,

513
00:30:36,665 --> 00:30:40,658
but all this criminal activity
fucks up your shit for good
with the big airlines

514
00:30:41,237 --> 00:30:45,207
Cut to 13 years later,
you're 44 years of age,

flying for the shittiest little
shuttle-fuckin'piece of shit

00:30:49,545 --> 00:30:52,181
where you make what¡­
$ 13,000 a year?

517
00:30:52,181 --> 00:30:54,950
I make 16,000,
plus benefits

518
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:58,943
You been in the service industry
19 years, and all you make is 16,000,
plus benefits?

519
00:30:59,321 --> 00:31:03,314
Didn't exactly set the world
on fire, did you, Jackie?

520
00:31:03,993 --> 00:31:06,262
Jackie, you have
a good lawyer?

521
00:31:06,262 --> 00:31:08,764
[Dargas] Can she afford
a good one, is more like it

522
00:31:08,764 --> 00:31:11,267
Otherwise you'll be
in Sybil Brand three weeks¡­

523
00:31:11,267 --> 00:31:14,970

gets around to ya

named Beaumont Livingston?

Well, he knew you

528
00:31:28,651 --> 00:31:31,420
He doesn't know anybody now.
He's dead

529
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:34,590
They found him in a trunk
of a car this morning

530
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,759
shot twice

531
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:40,596
Once in the chest,
once in the head

532
00:31:40,596 --> 00:31:42,998
Here you go.
So I guess I'm wondering

533
00:31:42,998 --> 00:31:46,991
If you don't know Beaumont

534
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:51,963
why do you suppose Beaumont
knows you?

535
00:31:54,777 --> 00:31:58,770
[Clears Throat] Look, Miss Brown,
we don't give a fuck about you

536
00:31:59,782 --> 00:32:01,784
You know who we want

537
00:32:01,784 --> 00:32:05,621
If you cooperate, tell us what we want
to know, we'll help you get out of this

538
00:32:05,621 --> 00:32:09,614
If you refuse to cooperate,
continue to cop a shit attitude
like you're doing now

539
00:32:09,692 --> 00:32:12,795
we will give you to Customs
and they will take you to court

540
00:32:12,795 --> 00:32:15,464
With your prior, thejudge
will give you two years

541
00:32:15,464 --> 00:32:18,967
Now, you'll probably only end up
serving a year and some change

I had a year to throw away

00:34:43,545 --> 00:34:46,148
and the extreme possibility of flight
due to the occupation

582
00:34:46,148 --> 00:34:48,851
the state requests a bond
of no less than 25,000

583
00:34:48,851 --> 00:34:52,844
[Judge]
You people are fine with this?

584
00:35:00,863 --> 00:35:03,899
I'm gonna set bond
at 10,000¡­

585
00:35:03,899 --> 00:35:06,869
and set the date
of August 21¡­

586
00:35:06,869 --> 00:35:08,971
for the prelim

587
00:35:08,971 --> 00:35:10,973
Your Honor,
when will that be?

588
00:35:10,973 --> 00:35:14,966
That's six weeks from now.
We'll continue this matter then

589
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:19,114
Owens, case 72242

590
00:35:19,114 --> 00:35:21,717
The charge is possession
of a concealed weapon¡­

591
00:35:21,717 --> 00:35:24,786
and striking an officer

592
00:35:24,786 --> 00:35:28,779
- How does your client plead?
- I thought it'd be 25

593
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:32,794
[Female Lawyer] Uh, my client
would like to plead guilty, Your Honor

594
00:35:32,794 --> 00:35:36,787
[Judge] Is the arresting officer
here in the courtroom?

595
00:35:43,205 --> 00:35:46,808
[Toilet Flushing]

596
00:35:46,808 --> 00:35:50,801
Uh-uh-uh. I didn't hear you
wash your hands

597
00:35:52,915 --> 00:35:55,117
- Comfortable?
- Yeah

598
00:35:55,117 --> 00:35:59,110
- Door was open, so I just come on in.
- I can see that

599
00:35:59,555 --> 00:36:01,757
- Why?
- Got some more business for you

600
00:36:01,757 --> 00:36:03,926
Oh, yeah?
What did he do?

601
00:36:03,926 --> 00:36:06,762
She is an airline stewardess

602
00:36:06,762 --> 00:36:09,631
Got caught coming back
from Mexico with some blow

603
00:36:09,631 --> 00:36:12,701
They set her bond
this afternoon at $10,000

604
00:36:12,701 --> 00:36:16,694
Now, I'm figuring you could take
that $10,000 you owe me from Beaumont

605
00:36:17,205 --> 00:36:19,207
move it over
to the stewardess

606
00:36:19,207 --> 00:36:22,511
- The bond for possession's
only a thousand.
- Hmm. Yeah

607
00:36:22,511 --> 00:36:26,504
Man, they fuckin' with her. They callin'
that shit ¡°possession with intent.¡±

608
00:36:26,782 --> 00:36:30,018
A 44-year-old black woman
caught with less than two ounces

609
00:36:30,018 --> 00:36:32,020
they calling that shit ¡°intent.¡±

610
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:35,924
The same thing happen to a movie star,
they call it ¡°possession.¡±

611
00:36:35,924 --> 00:36:37,926
Still sounds high

612
00:36:37,926 --> 00:36:41,919
Well, um, she had on her,
I believe it was 50 grand in cash

613
00:36:43,131 --> 00:36:46,602
All right, before we start
talking about stewardesses

614
00:36:46,602 --> 00:36:48,870
let's get Beaumont
out of the way first

615
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:51,073
You know, I think
somebody already did

616
00:36:51,073 --> 00:36:53,709
- What?
- You ain't hear?

617
00:36:53,709 --> 00:36:57,679
- Hear what?
- Somebody with a grudge
blew Beaumont's brains out

618
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:00,682
Oh, shit.
That shit rhymes

619
00:37:00,682 --> 00:37:04,286
Blew Beaumont's
brains out

620
00:37:04,286 --> 00:37:06,822
Police make contact
with you?

621
00:37:06,822 --> 00:37:10,325
Oh, hell, yeah.
First motherfucking thing they did

622
00:37:10,325 --> 00:37:13,061
You know, they see I pay
a big money bond for my boy

623
00:37:13,061 --> 00:37:16,064
they start thinking that ¡°where there's
smoke there's fire¡± logic

624
00:37:16,064 --> 00:37:18,834
Rousted my ass out of bed
10:00 in the morning

625
00:37:18,834 --> 00:37:21,069
Scared the shit out
of my woman Sheronda

626
00:37:21,069 --> 00:37:24,072
She thought they was gonna
take my ass away for sure

627
00:37:24,072 --> 00:37:27,776
- This stewardess¡­
You know her last name?
- Mm-hmm

628
00:37:27,776 --> 00:37:31,613
Brown.
Jackie Brown

629
00:37:31,613 --> 00:37:34,082
- What does she do for you?
- Who said she do anything for me?

630
00:37:34,082 --> 00:37:37,786
She's my friend. My friends get
in trouble, I like to help them out

631
00:37:37,786 --> 00:37:39,855
Beaumont worked for you

632
00:37:39,855 --> 00:37:43,291
This you and me talking,
like lawyer-client thing?

633
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:45,293
You can't tell nothing
I say to you?

634
00:37:45,293 --> 00:37:48,930
You're not my client till you
get busted and I bond you out

635
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:52,923
Well, we ain't got no, uh¡­
What you call that shit?

636
00:37:53,201 --> 00:37:55,203
Confidentiality

637
00:37:55,203 --> 00:37:57,205
Why should I
tell you anything?

638
00:37:57,205 --> 00:37:59,775
'Cause you want me to know
what a slick guy you are

639
00:37:59,775 --> 00:38:02,144
You got stewardesses
bringing you 50 grand

640
00:38:02,144 --> 00:38:05,414
And why would a stewardess
be bringing me 50 grand?

641
00:38:05,414 --> 00:38:08,984
Now you want me to speculate
on what you do

642
00:38:08,984 --> 00:38:12,977
I'd say you were in the drug business,
except the money's moving
in the wrong direction

643
00:38:13,689 --> 00:38:17,682
Whatever you're into, you seem
to be getting away with it,
so, uh, more power to you

644
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,263
All right.
You want another bond?

645
00:38:21,263 --> 00:38:24,066
You want to move the 10,000 you got
on Beaumont over to the stewardess

646
00:38:24,066 --> 00:38:26,068
That means paperwork

647
00:38:26,068 --> 00:38:28,737
I gotta get a death certificate,
present it to the court

648
00:38:28,737 --> 00:38:32,207
make out a receipt for
return of bond collateral,
I type up another application

649
00:38:32,207 --> 00:38:34,309
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Another indemnity agreement

650
00:38:34,309 --> 00:38:36,812
- I haven't got time.
- I'm telling you what I have to do

651
00:38:36,812 --> 00:38:38,814
What you have to do,
in case you forgot

652
00:38:38,814 --> 00:38:42,017
- is come up with a premium
of a thousand bucks.
- I can do that

653
00:38:42,017 --> 00:38:45,020
You know I got the money.
I just ain't got it with me

654
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,689
Come back when you do.
I'll bond out the stewardess

655
00:38:47,689 --> 00:38:51,682
Look, you got to look at this
with a little compassion, all right?

656
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,963
Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't
used to this kind of treatment

657
00:38:54,963 --> 00:38:57,899
Gangsters don't give a fuck,
but your average citizen

658
00:38:57,899 --> 00:39:00,902
a couple of nights in County
get to fuckin' with their mind

659
00:39:00,902 --> 00:39:03,238
Ordell, this isn't a bar.
You don't have a tab

660
00:39:03,238 --> 00:39:05,373
Listen to me, all right?

661
00:39:05,373 --> 00:39:09,366
You got a 44-year-old, gainfully
employed black woman falsely accused¡­

662
00:39:10,011 --> 00:39:13,782
Falsely accused? She didn't come
back from Mexico with cocaine on her?

663
00:39:13,782 --> 00:39:16,151
Falsely accused
of¡°intent.¡±

664
00:39:16,151 --> 00:39:19,688
If she had that shit¡­
and mind you, I'm saying if¡­

665
00:39:19,688 --> 00:39:22,224
that was her own personal shit
to get high with

666
00:39:22,224 --> 00:39:26,217
Is white guilt supposed to make me
forget I'm running a business?

667
00:39:28,797 --> 00:39:32,790
Oh, it's like that, huh?

668
00:39:36,004 --> 00:39:39,997
All right

669
00:39:40,475 --> 00:39:44,468
I got your little
thousand bucks

¡°Why do I feel this way¡±

680
00:41:12,601 --> 00:41:14,803
¡°Thinking about you¡±

681
00:41:14,803 --> 00:41:17,339
¡°Every day¡±

[Max]

00:41:23,478 --> 00:41:26,147
- Yes?
- ¡°Take me in your arms¡±

693
00:41:57,212 --> 00:42:01,205
¡°Call me and I
will do it for you¡±

694
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:05,587
You really
a bail bondsman?

695
00:42:05,587 --> 00:42:07,622
Well, who do you
think I am?

696
00:42:07,622 --> 00:42:11,559
- I showed you my card in there.
- Can I see your I.D.?

697
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:14,262
You're serious?

698
00:42:14,262 --> 00:42:18,255
¡°That wish would be
for you to live¡±

¡°Forever and ever¡±

700
00:42:23,171 --> 00:42:25,173
Who paid my bond?

701
00:42:25,173 --> 00:42:29,166
- Ordell?
- In cash

702
00:42:29,277 --> 00:42:33,270
¡°My heart skips a beat¡±

703
00:42:34,582 --> 00:42:38,575
- ¡°And I take to the sky
on a natural high¡±
- ¡°I just take to the sky¡±

704
00:42:39,454 --> 00:42:43,447
- ¡°Loving you more till the day I die¡±
- ¡°On a natural high¡±

705
00:42:44,259 --> 00:42:48,252

- ¡°I don't know you¡±

706
00:42:49,197 --> 00:42:53,190
¡°Loving you more¡±

707
00:43:00,108 --> 00:43:02,544
You got any cigarettes
in here?

708
00:43:02,544 --> 00:43:06,537
You won't find
any cigarettes in there

709
00:43:07,515 --> 00:43:11,453
- Can we stop and get cigarettes?
- Sure

710
00:43:11,453 --> 00:43:14,122
Have you ever been
to the River Bottom?

711
00:43:14,122 --> 00:43:18,115
- I don't think so.
- It's all right. It's a cop bar

712
00:43:18,193 --> 00:43:21,696
Can we just stop
at a 7-Eleven or something?

713
00:43:21,696 --> 00:43:25,689
- I thought you might
like to have a drink.
- I'd love to, but not there

714
00:43:27,068 --> 00:43:29,604
How 'bout the Hilton
by the airport?

715
00:43:29,604 --> 00:43:33,141
- Is it dark?
- Kind of a sports bar

716
00:43:33,141 --> 00:43:36,144
It doesn't sound dark

717
00:43:36,144 --> 00:43:38,313
Why does it
have to be dark?

718
00:43:38,313 --> 00:43:42,306
Because it looks like I just
got out of jail, that's why

719
00:43:43,351 --> 00:43:47,344
You're dropping me off at my place.
There's a joint near me

[Metallic Rattling]

[Metal Ball Rattling]

722
00:43:56,631 --> 00:43:59,234
No, thanks.
I quit three years ago

723
00:43:59,234 --> 00:44:01,970
- Gain weight?
- Ten pounds

724
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:04,672
- Take it off and put it back on.
- [Scoffs]

725
00:44:04,672 --> 00:44:08,665
That's why I don't quit

726

if I cooperate

then I'll get probation,
maybe

I can get as much as five years

- I am. Come on in

Would you, uh, care to
hang on to it for a while?

It wouldn't be legal, but if it
makes you feel better, I guess¡­

No, I want to talk to them first.
I know more now about Ordell's money

918
00:56:47,067 --> 00:56:51,060
Well, if it's the A.T.F. Guy
that wants you, that'll only
interest him up to a point

919
00:56:51,238 --> 00:56:53,974
I know, but it's
a lot of money

920
00:56:53,974 --> 00:56:57,978
It's a half a million dollars
all in Cabo, and more coming in

921
00:56:57,978 --> 00:57:01,971
- How'd you find that out?
- Ordell told me last night

922
00:57:02,116 --> 00:57:05,753
- He called?
- He came by

923

- What'd you do?
- We talked

924
00:57:09,390 --> 00:57:11,826
Do you think
he still trusts you?

925
00:57:11,826 --> 00:57:15,262
He had his doubts at first,
but he's always trusted me

926
00:57:15,262 --> 00:57:19,255
And he wants to believe more than
anything else that he still can

927
00:57:21,769 --> 00:57:24,071
- Why?
- Because he needs my ass

928
00:57:24,071 --> 00:57:28,064
Otherwise, that money's just gonna sit
over there in Cabo. You want some sugar?

929
00:57:28,342 --> 00:57:32,335
No, thank you. There's gotta be
other ways of getting it out

930
00:57:32,379 --> 00:57:35,549
Maybe, but I'm the only one
he's ever used

931
00:57:35,549 --> 00:57:38,552
I mean, he can't use his other people.
They're crooks

932
00:57:38,552 --> 00:57:41,488
I mean, he might try to¡­
bring the money in himself

933
00:57:41,488 --> 00:57:44,124
but he ain't gonna wanna
stand in no customs lines

934
00:57:44,124 --> 00:57:47,962
So, either he recruits another Cabo
stewardess or he continues to trust me

935
00:57:47,962 --> 00:57:50,564
And I made him feel
like he still can

936
00:57:50,564 --> 00:57:53,534
Are you gonna offer
to set him up?

00:57:53,534 --> 00:57:57,171
Yeah, if I get off.
Otherwise, fuck 'em

- It's not really something
I think about

945
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:33,263
- Really?
- I guess I got sensitive
about my hair a few years ago

946
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:37,011
It started falling out,
so I did something about it

947

How'd you feel about that?

948

I feel fine with it.
Otherwise, I wouldn't have done it

949
00:58:42,082 --> 00:58:45,953
I did it to feel better about myself,
and, you know, I do

I look in the mirror.

too sorry for you in this department

Well, I've flown
over seven million miles

966
00:59:39,006 --> 00:59:42,276
and I've been waiting
on people for 20 years

967
00:59:42,276 --> 00:59:45,946
Then after my bust, the best job
I could get was with Cabo Air

968
00:59:45,946 --> 00:59:49,583
which is the worst job
you can get in this industry

969
00:59:49,583 --> 00:59:52,152
You know I make
16,000 a year

970
00:59:52,152 --> 00:59:55,589
plus retirement benefits
that ain't worth a damn?

00:59:55,589 --> 00:59:59,293
And with this arrest hanging over
my head, Max, I'm scared

972
00:59:59,293 --> 01:00:02,162
And if I lose this job,
I gotta start all over again

973
01:00:02,162 --> 01:00:04,465
and I ain't got nothing
to start over with

974
01:00:04,465 --> 01:00:07,634
I'll be stuck
with whatever I can get

you got to confirm it

1164
01:10:28,622 --> 01:10:30,890
Look, the only way they're going
to give me permission to fly¡­

1165
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:34,694
is if I agree to help 'em, which is
what I have to appear to be doing

1166
01:10:34,694 --> 01:10:38,031
So I might as well give them
somebody they already know¡­ you

1167
01:10:38,031 --> 01:10:39,966
You tell 'em
anything else?

1168
01:10:39,966 --> 01:10:43,737
Yeah, you got a half a mil in Mexico
and you want me to bring it in

1169
01:10:43,737 --> 01:10:46,906
- Goddamn¡­ You told them all that?
- It's true, ain't it?

1170
01:10:46,906 --> 01:10:49,909
What the fuck that got
to do with anything?

1171
01:10:49,909 --> 01:10:51,945
They know I'm
delivering for you

1172
01:10:51,945 --> 01:10:54,748
I told 'em about the half mil.
They could give a fuck about it

1173
01:10:54,748 --> 01:10:57,283
All they wanna do
is catch your ass with guns

1174
01:10:57,283 --> 01:11:00,153
So I said, Look, you want proof
he's getting paid for selling 'em?

1175
01:11:00,153 --> 01:11:02,622
- Let me bring in the money.
- And they said?

1176
01:11:02,622 --> 01:11:05,392
- Yes.
- [Grunts]

1177
01:11:05,392 --> 01:11:09,229
Hey, what's the matter? I mean,
that's what we discussed last night

1178
01:11:09,229 --> 01:11:13,166
This is just seeming kind of risky now,
you know. Fuck this

1179
01:11:13,166 --> 01:11:16,002
Now, let me lay it all out
to you, okay?

1180
01:11:16,002 --> 01:11:19,005
I make two deliveries¡­
the first with 10,000

1181
01:11:19,005 --> 01:11:22,609
You know, like a dry run?
They watch it, see how it works

1182
01:11:22,609 --> 01:11:25,011
Then the second delivery,
I come home with the half mil

1183
01:11:25,011 --> 01:11:27,614
Mm-mm, mm-mm.
See, that's too much exposure

1184
01:11:27,614 --> 01:11:30,617
- Now, I ain't goin'
nowhere near that money.
- You don't have to

1185
01:11:30,617 --> 01:11:32,919
I told them you never
pick up the money yourself

1186
01:11:32,919 --> 01:11:36,189
- You always send someone,
and I never know who it is.
- Mm

1187
01:11:36,189 --> 01:11:39,726
- That's a good idea.
- If you listen, it's a damn good idea

1188
01:11:39,726 --> 01:11:42,729
Now, the first time I do it,
they're looking around

1189
01:11:42,729 --> 01:11:45,165
they see me hand
the 10,000 to someone

1190
01:11:45,165 --> 01:11:48,668
- Who?
- I don't know. A friend of yours

1191
01:11:48,668 --> 01:11:51,838
- Like a woman?
- If you want

1192
01:11:51,838 --> 01:11:54,441
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm thinking a woman

1193
01:11:54,441 --> 01:11:57,177
Wait a minute.
If they're gonna let you go

1194
01:11:57,177 --> 01:12:00,447
- how come we don't bring all
the cash in the first time?
- 'Cause I don't trust 'em

1195
01:12:00,447 --> 01:12:03,283
Now, the next trip,
when I bring in the half mils

1196
01:12:03,283 --> 01:12:06,219
it's gonna look like I'm doing
the same thing as I did before

1197
01:12:06,219 --> 01:12:09,889
- But you don't?
- No. I hand it to someone else first

1198
01:12:09,889 --> 01:12:12,325
Hmm.
And they follow the wrong one

1199
01:12:12,325 --> 01:12:14,461
thinking she's bringing
the money to me

1200
01:12:14,461 --> 01:12:18,131
- That's the idea.
- So, we gonna need two women

1201
01:12:18,131 --> 01:12:20,734
- Can you cover that?
- Yeah

1202
01:12:20,734 --> 01:12:23,002
Yeah, I got
the women covered

1203
01:12:23,002 --> 01:12:25,472
Where are you planning
on pulling this off?

1204
01:12:25,472 --> 01:12:28,141
The Del Amo Mall,
the food court

1205
01:12:28,141 --> 01:12:31,144
And I suppose you see
a piece of this for yourself?

1206
01:12:31,144 --> 01:12:33,713
It's my plan.
We're in this together

1207
01:12:33,713 --> 01:12:36,483
Yeah, but it's my money
and I don't need no fuckin' partners

1208
01:12:36,483 --> 01:12:39,052
I ain't your partner.
I'm your manager

1209
01:12:39,052 --> 01:12:42,422
And I'm managing to get your money out
of Mexico, into America, in your hands

1210
01:12:42,422 --> 01:12:45,024
and I'm managing to do it
all under the nose of the cops

1211
01:12:45,024 --> 01:12:47,994
So, therefore, I'm your manager,
and a manager gets 15%

1212
01:12:47,994 --> 01:12:51,164
- No, a manager gets ten percent.
- No, that's an agent

1213
01:12:51,164 --> 01:12:53,299
- I'm gonna give you ten.
- No. No

1214
01:12:53,299 --> 01:12:56,069
A manager gets 15%,
agent gets 10

1215
01:12:56,069 --> 01:12:58,071
I'm getting 15%,
all right?

1216
01:12:58,071 --> 01:13:00,840
All I'm gonna give you
is ten

1217
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:04,833
And the same deal
as before

1218
01:13:07,514 --> 01:13:10,984
I can do that

1219
01:13:10,984 --> 01:13:13,753
So he says, ¡°Fuck that, '¡±
and moves over into guns

1220
01:13:13,753 --> 01:13:16,756
See, you can sell guns wherever there's
a demand, and nobody gives a shit

1221
01:13:16,756 --> 01:13:19,359
He's acting like he's this
big international arms dealer¡­

1222
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:23,352
when, come on, face it, the only people
he ever sold to were dopers

1223
01:13:25,732 --> 01:13:28,334
Well, he seems
to be making out

1224
01:13:28,334 --> 01:13:31,204
- Is it dead?
- Yeah

1225
01:13:31,204 --> 01:13:33,907
Yeah, well¡­
so far, he is

1226
01:13:33,907 --> 01:13:36,910
But you got to admit,
he's not too bright

1227
01:13:36,910 --> 01:13:40,903
Oh¡­ I wouldn't go
so far as to say that

1228
01:13:41,047 --> 01:13:43,416
He moves his lips
when he reads

1229
01:13:43,416 --> 01:13:45,552
What does that
tell you?

1230
01:13:45,552 --> 01:13:48,888
Let's say that he's
streetwise, you know

1231
01:13:48,888 --> 01:13:52,525
We'll give him that.
He's still a fuckup

1232
01:13:52,525 --> 01:13:56,518
[Water Gurgling]

1233
01:14:04,237 --> 01:14:08,107
He killed a man who
worked for him the other day

1234
01:14:08,107 --> 01:14:12,100
- Well¡­
- [Gurgling]

1235
01:14:12,312 --> 01:14:15,048
So, what are you trying
to tell me?

1236
01:14:15,048 --> 01:14:17,317
That I should get
out of here?

1237
01:14:17,317 --> 01:14:19,886
That's not what
I'm saying at all

1238
01:14:19,886 --> 01:14:23,879
You know where he went?
He went to go meet that stewardess

1239
01:14:25,158 --> 01:14:29,151
- Does that bother you?
- Please!

1240
01:14:29,596 --> 01:14:32,532
Well, I don't know.
You live with him, so¡­

1241
01:14:32,532 --> 01:14:36,236
No, I live here.
He just drops in and out

1242
01:14:36,236 --> 01:14:39,973
Did he tell you about that half million
he's got down in Mexico?

1243
01:14:39,973 --> 01:14:42,876
- Uh-huh.
- Of course he did.
He tells anybody who's gonna listen

1244
01:14:42,876 --> 01:14:45,278
Well, that's what him
and that stewardess are doing

1245
01:14:45,278 --> 01:14:48,882
They're scheming on how
they can get that money over here

1246
01:14:48,882 --> 01:14:51,417
And your point is?

1247
01:14:51,417 --> 01:14:55,410
- Let him and the stewardess
get the money over here,
- Uh-huh

1248
01:14:56,356 --> 01:15:00,349
And then just
take it from them

1249

[Man] ¡°A man we passed
just tried to stare me down¡±

1250
01:15:08,001 --> 01:15:11,104
- Can I ask you a question?
- [Ordell] Oh, man

1251
01:15:11,104 --> 01:15:15,097
- You ain't gonna get serious
while we're in here chilling?
- No. It's just about Melanie

1252
01:15:15,475 --> 01:15:18,311
You know what?
I'm real sorry about that, man

1253
01:15:18,311 --> 01:15:20,914
but I had to be somewhere
all of a sudden

1254
01:15:20,914 --> 01:15:23,516
I figured, well, shit,
Louis ain't had no pussy for a while

1255
01:15:23,516 --> 01:15:26,653
So I thought, let him
kick it here with Mel

1256

¡°The things that you do¡±

1258

So, what she say?

1259
01:15:34,027 --> 01:15:37,063
She didn't have to say shit.
I know Melanie

1260
01:15:37,063 --> 01:15:40,266
That bitch is gonna be fucking you
two minutes after I'm out the door

1261

Melanie real good about
throwing a fuck a nigger's way

1262
01:15:43,136 --> 01:15:47,006
I mean, she ain't no damn good at it,
but she likes to fuck

1263
01:15:47,006 --> 01:15:50,009
- Oh, so she ain't your girlfriend?
- Is that what you thought?

1264
01:15:50,009 --> 01:15:53,012
- No, I wasn't sure. I didn't know.
- But you fucked her anyway?

1265
01:15:53,012 --> 01:15:55,014
Well¡­

1266
01:15:55,014 --> 01:15:58,451
the ¡°not your girlfriend¡± part
I felt more about

1267
01:15:58,451 --> 01:16:01,454
Oh. Well, I hope you felt
appropriately guilty afterwards

1268
01:16:01,454 --> 01:16:05,447
Afterwards, I did

1269
01:16:08,594 --> 01:16:12,587
Oh, oh, shit

1270
01:16:13,666 --> 01:16:17,470
[Clears Throat] But, um¡­ But, like,
you know, what is she to you?

1271
01:16:17,470 --> 01:16:20,306
You know, she's just one of
the bitches I got set up

1272
01:16:20,306 --> 01:16:22,909
I got Mel
over in Hermosa Beach

1273
01:16:22,909 --> 01:16:25,645
and I rent this little place for Simone
over in Compton where you're staying

1274
01:16:25,645 --> 01:16:29,638
and about four blocks away
I got this young 19-year-old
country girl named Sheronda

1275
01:16:30,249 --> 01:16:33,052
I found her on the bus stop
two days out of Georgia

1276
01:16:33,052 --> 01:16:35,321
barefoot,
country as a chicken coop

1277
01:16:35,321 --> 01:16:38,324
Took her to my place in Compton,
told her it was Hollywood

1278
01:16:38,324 --> 01:16:41,294
- [Laughing] She believed you?
- Hell, yeah

1279
01:16:41,294 --> 01:16:44,130
To her dumb country ass,
Compton is Hollywood

1280

Closest she ever been,
anyway

1281
01:16:46,466 --> 01:16:49,435
But you trust Melanie
around your business?

Oh!

She trying to play your ass
against me, ain't she?

1284
01:16:55,174 --> 01:16:58,044
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh. See, I knew it

1285
01:16:58,044 --> 01:17:02,037
I knew it. I knew it! See, you didn't
have to say nothing. I know that bitch

1286
01:17:02,315 --> 01:17:06,152
I don't understand why you keep
someone around your business
and you can't even trust 'em

1287
01:17:06,152 --> 01:17:08,955
I ain't gotta trust her.
I know her

1288
01:17:08,955 --> 01:17:12,125
I don't know
what that means, man

1289
01:17:12,125 --> 01:17:14,594
Well, you can't
trust Melanie

1290
01:17:14,594 --> 01:17:18,164
but you can always trust
Melanie to be Melanie

1291
01:17:18,164 --> 01:17:21,667
Well, I don't understand
why you keep her the fuck around

1292
01:17:21,667 --> 01:17:25,004
I told you, man.
She's my fine little surfer girl

You know, she ain't pretty
as she used to be¡­

It could work

to go somewhere and spend the night

I just want you to go out for

So now you're
going to pout!

Now it's going to take her 20 minutes

You got that we do it the way

01:32:24,557 --> 01:32:26,859
- Sheronda passed the money
on to somebody else.
- How do you know she did that?

It's my goddamn money! I can do

Right.
The same one Simone gives me, okay?

Now, Simone and I make the switch in
Billingsley. She knows what I look like?

She's seen you
with Sheronda, remember?

Why over there?

Because they're gonna be
watching my ass hard

in doing it out in the open¡­

the dressing room, wait on you¡­

to be doing during all this?

That shit work my nerves, you and that
motherfucker being so buddy-buddy

working for him named Louis

- Yeah, this afternoon
before I came here

1536
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:23,002
He was at Ordell's apartment
in Hermosa Beach. Yeah

1537
01:35:23,002 --> 01:35:25,204
I don't know if he lives there,
but I can find out

1538
01:35:25,204 --> 01:35:28,875
- Did you talk to him?
- Not really. Mm-mm

1539
01:35:28,875 --> 01:35:32,868
His full name's Louis Gara.
Just did four years up in Susanville

01:35:32,979 --> 01:35:36,149
- For what?
- Bank robbery

1541
01:35:36,149 --> 01:35:39,986
We've been following him.
He definitely works for Ordell

1542
01:35:39,986 --> 01:35:42,889
They did two years together about,

20 years ago or so
over at Huntsville

1544
01:35:46,125 --> 01:35:48,928
He's not living over
in Hermosa Beach, though

1545
01:35:48,928 --> 01:35:51,831
Ordell's got him staying
down in Compton

Hmm

1549
01:36:00,106 --> 01:36:02,141
- You know her?
- No

1550
01:36:02,141 --> 01:36:06,134
- They ever talk about her?
- Not yet

1551
01:36:07,814 --> 01:36:09,849
Okay, who's the other one?

1552
01:36:09,849 --> 01:36:12,852
Some white chick named Melanie,
another girlfriend of Ordell's

1553
01:36:12,852 --> 01:36:15,621
- What's her deal?
- It was her coke I got busted with

1554
01:36:15,621 --> 01:36:17,924
- Oh, yeah?
- She knows everything.
She's not a part of it

1555
01:36:17,924 --> 01:36:20,827
and she's pissed off
that she's not a part of it

1556
01:36:20,827 --> 01:36:23,062
Well, this is definitely
somebody I wanna meet

1557
01:36:23,062 --> 01:36:25,832
Okay, are we all set up for tomorrow?
Everything okay?

1558
01:36:25,832 --> 01:36:28,668
Everything's the same,
except for one change

1559
01:36:28,668 --> 01:36:32,138
- I told him Ordell's changing
the amount he's bringing in.
- Think they bought it?

1560
01:36:32,138 --> 01:36:35,107
Mm, oh, yeah. I got 'em thinking
that Ordell's real nervous

1561
01:36:35,107 --> 01:36:37,910
and they love thinking
that he's scared of'em

1562
01:36:37,910 --> 01:36:41,903
You know, a good cop will never let you
know that he knows you're full of shit

1563
01:36:42,548 --> 01:36:45,551
All he needed was
a reasonable explanation

1564
01:36:45,551 --> 01:36:47,820
Everything's the same,
except for one change

1565
01:36:47,820 --> 01:36:50,022
What's that?

1566
01:36:50,022 --> 01:36:52,325
Ordell feels way too hot
for him to bring in his money

1567
01:36:52,325 --> 01:36:54,827
and he knows you're watching him
and he's fucking paranoid

1568
01:36:54,827 --> 01:36:57,730
- So he's sweating a little bit.
- He's gonna keep his half mil
where it is

1569
01:36:57,730 --> 01:37:00,867
but he's gonna bring in 50,000
just in case he needs bail

1570
01:37:00,867 --> 01:37:03,769
- It'll be more than that.
- Don't be so literal. Ray believed it

1571
01:37:03,769 --> 01:37:06,172
You still have to show him
the money at the airport

1572
01:37:06,172 --> 01:37:09,242
I'm not gonna show him the whole amount.
He'll see 50,000

1573
01:37:09,242 --> 01:37:12,078
- And where's the rest of it?
- In the bag, underneath

1574
01:37:12,078 --> 01:37:14,680
- What ifhe checks?
- He won't. He didn't before

1575
01:37:14,680 --> 01:37:18,673
He's expecting to see 50,000,
and there it is, on top

1576
01:37:20,152 --> 01:37:23,289
- You're taking a hell of a chance, kid.
- Not really

1577
01:37:23,289 --> 01:37:26,025
If he finds it, I'll say
Mr. Walker put it in there¡­

1578
01:37:26,025 --> 01:37:28,861
and I didn't know anything about it,
like the coke

1579
01:37:28,861 --> 01:37:31,297
- Well, then you're out. You get nothing.
- Yeah, but I'm not in jail¡­

1580
01:37:31,297 --> 01:37:33,599
and at least I tried

1581
01:37:33,599 --> 01:37:37,403
You're going to have
surveillance all over you

1582
01:37:37,403 --> 01:37:40,973
That's why you don't make a move
until I come out of that fitting room

1583
01:37:40,973 --> 01:37:44,210
- Wearing a dress.
- Well, a suit.
There's this one I had my eye on

1584

02:03:24,961 --> 02:03:27,230
then maybe she didn't get
a chance to take the money¡­

1878
02:03:27,230 --> 02:03:29,232
out of her suitcase
and the A.T.F. Got it

1879
02:03:29,232 --> 02:03:31,267
But she put them books
in there to trick our ass

1880
02:03:31,267 --> 02:03:33,336
Well, that's why I didn't check it.
Because the bag felt right

1881
02:03:33,336 --> 02:03:37,273
That's right.
And then she puts 40 grand or so
in there to rub that shit in my face

1882
02:03:37,273 --> 02:03:40,610
You know what I'm sayin'?
She wants me to know she ripped me off

1883
02:03:40,610 --> 02:03:44,603
Ah. I don¡­ I don¡­ You know,
I don't know. I don't know

1884
02:03:45,147 --> 02:03:48,451
Unless, you know, either she's
got it or the Feds got it

1885
02:03:48,451 --> 02:03:51,687
Or¡­ Or¡­
Now, check this out

1886
02:03:51,687 --> 02:03:54,690
What if she gave the money
to somebody else first¡­

1887
02:03:54,690 --> 02:03:57,727
before Melanie even went
in the dressing room

1888
02:03:57,727 --> 02:04:01,564
Uh-huh

1889
02:04:01,564 --> 02:04:04,300
- Oh, man. You know what?
- What?

1890
02:04:04,300 --> 02:04:07,737
- Do you know who I saw
in the dress department?
- No, tell me

1891
02:04:07,737 --> 02:04:11,173
I didn't think anything of it.
L¡­ No, no, I did wonder
what he was doin' there

1892
02:04:11,173 --> 02:04:14,110
I wondered what he was doin' there, but
I thought it had nothin' to do with us

1893
02:04:14,110 --> 02:04:16,712
Like, maybe he was with his wife
or his girlfriend. It's a big place¡­

1894
02:04:16,712 --> 02:04:19,582
Louis, Louis, Louis!
You gonna tell me who you saw?

in the dress department where we¡­

Man, look at me
when I'm talkin' to you!

1898
02:04:32,628 --> 02:04:35,498
You see that motherfucker
in the dress department when we
about to get a half million dollars

1899

- And you don't think nothin'
about him bein' there?
- No. Do they know each other?

Hell, yeah, they know each other.
He bonded her ass out of County

if I don't know nothin' about them
knowin' each other?

1910

I don't know,
I'd go shoppin' later

1923
02:06:29,178 --> 02:06:32,281
Well, I got there early.
You see, I've had my eye on this suit¡­

Just wait a fuckin' second, all right?
Let me finish

1927
02:06:40,289 --> 02:06:44,282
I got there early. The idea was to
try on the suit, see if I liked it

1928
02:06:44,860 --> 02:06:47,696
If I did, they would wrap it up,
and I would put back on my uniform¡­

'cause Sheronda
is expecting me to wear it

Meet Sheronda, give her the shopping bag
with the $50,000 and go home

1931
02:06:54,470 --> 02:06:56,739
Yeah, but you didn't do that

1932
02:06:56,739 --> 02:06:59,275
Because I couldn't.
Ray, I swear

1933
02:06:59,275 --> 02:07:01,944
Melanie burst in.
She grabbed the bag

1934
02:07:01,944 --> 02:07:05,937
And then somebody
fuckin' killed her for it

1935
02:07:11,320 --> 02:07:13,756
What happened
to the bag she gave you?

1936
02:07:13,756 --> 02:07:17,749
She didn't give me a bag.
Melanie was not a part of the plan

1937
02:07:18,360 --> 02:07:20,463
Ordell probably told her
to do it

1938
02:07:20,463 --> 02:07:22,631
That's why she came into the dressing
room, grabbed the bag, took off

1939
02:07:22,631 --> 02:07:25,634
But I couldn't go after her,
because I was in my fucking underwear

1940
02:07:25,634 --> 02:07:28,304
And I had to put on this suit because I
could put it on faster than my uniform¡­

1941
02:07:28,304 --> 02:07:31,240
- You had time to pay the sales chick.
- I had to. Ray, I was frantic

What was I supposed
to do?

1943
02:07:39,882 --> 02:07:42,551
All right,
what you do after that?

1944
02:07:42,551 --> 02:07:45,387
I went lookin' for you. And I went
back to the place in the mall¡­

where you were before,
but you weren't there

1946
02:07:47,556 --> 02:07:51,227
What was I supposed to do
if something happens?
You didn't tell me how to do that

1947
02:07:51,227 --> 02:07:54,396
There was a guy
with Melanie?

You've no idea where the 50 grand is?

gone here, could've gone there?

shot in the car on Ninth

We were,
and we lost him

He walked into a strip bar sometime
around 3:30 and never came out

1970

less than a mile and a half
from where they found Louis

shot him twice, point-blank range

You didn't pay for that snazzy new suit

of marked bills stuffed in her shorts

And I know you know
what I want

2019
02:12:39,481 --> 02:12:43,051
And Jackie can tell me any story
comes into her pretty little head

2020

as long as at the end of that story
she hands me my motherfuckin' money

Now, she wanna be my friend,

my friend no more

well, you just tell her
to think about old Beaumont

2024

And if she go to the police

2025

to you herself, and she wants
to collect her ten percent

2054

to make sure you got your money

And you helped her,
didn't you?

just to protect my interest?

how come she wasn't home?

- Oh, right. That I gotta see

She still is. She doesn't wanna get shot
before she can tell you what happened

2076
02:16:13,462 --> 02:16:16,932
- Tell her to bring the money over here.
- It's in the safe; she can't

to just go walkin' in there?

If she wanted to set you up,
you'd be in custody by now

2082
02:16:29,778 --> 02:16:33,771
When you told her that
you'd name her as an accessory,
that scared her more than anything

- Mmm

to give me my money, ain't it?
