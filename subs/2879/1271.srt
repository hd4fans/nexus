1
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:55,988
自去年后进入公司后 我的妻子总是鼓励我
You know, after last year's corporate, my wife was always encouraging me.

2
00:00:56,157 --> 00:00:59,531
她说，你干得很出色 你在公司干得很出色
You know, she said: you did fine, you did fine in the corporate.

3
00:00:59,631 --> 00:01:02,735
我有些紧张 这小麦克风...哈罗，对不起
I was a bit nervous. This little guy... hello. Sorry.

4
00:01:02,835 --> 00:01:06,138
这样很好，是吗？ 很好的背景，有人在那里
That's nice, eh? Nice background with the people there...

5
00:01:06,445 --> 00:01:09,951
- 我们正在...我必须这样看？ - 直看着镜头就好
We are here at the... must I look..? -Just look straight at the lens.

6
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:12,887
我们现在在MNU（多国联）总部
We are here at the... MNU head office,

7
00:01:13,087 --> 00:01:16,329
外星人事务部 我是维库斯・范德默尔
Wikus Van De Merwe Department of Alien Affairs. My name is Wikus Van De Merwe.

8
00:01:16,529 --> 00:01:19,902
在我身后，你会看到其他 外星人事务处的工作人员
And behind me you can see the Alien Affairs' workers.

9
00:01:20,103 --> 00:01:23,173
我们这个部门的工作是
And what we do here at this department is...

10
00:01:23,275 --> 00:01:26,077
我们试图与大虾沟通交流
we try to engage with the Prawn

11
00:01:26,178 --> 00:01:30,383
为了MNU和人类的利益
on behalf of MNU and on behalf of humans.

12
00:01:32,394 --> 00:01:36,068
让所有人都感到意外的是 太空船并没有停在
To everyone's surprise, the ship didn't come to a stop

13
00:01:36,169 --> 00:01:39,135
曼哈顿，华盛顿，抑或芝加哥
over Manhattan or Washington or Chicago,

14
00:01:39,236 --> 00:01:43,641
反而直接停在了约翰内斯堡上空
but instead it costed to a halt directly over the city of Johannesburg.

15
00:01:46,488 --> 00:01:50,561
船门在三个月内都没有打开 它就悬浮在那里，没人能够进去
The doors didn't open for 3 months. It just hovered there. Nobody could get in.

16
00:01:50,761 --> 00:01:53,394
在深思熟虑之后，他们终于决定
And they eventually decided, after much deliberation,

17
00:01:53,495 --> 00:01:57,699
最好的方法是切割飞船 破门而入
that the best thing to do would be to physically cut their way in.

18
00:02:04,522 --> 00:02:08,557
我们即将进行第一次接触
We were on the verge of first contact.

19
00:02:09,734 --> 00:02:12,560
整个世界都在注视着
The whole world was watching.

20
00:02:12,671 --> 00:02:15,043
期待着，或许是…
Expecting, I don't know...

21
00:02:15,143 --> 00:02:18,238
音乐伴着强光闪耀从天而降
...music from heaven and bright shining lights.

22
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:25,346
哦，天呀
Oh my God!

23
00:02:33,478 --> 00:02:36,611
这生物非常营养不良
The creatures were extremely malnourished,

24
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:40,224
他们非常不健康 看起来精神恍惚
they were very unhealthy, they seemed to be aimless.

25
00:02:40,425 --> 00:02:43,497
那时，我们承受着来自世界各地的压力
There was a lot of international pressure on us at the time.

26
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:46,104
整个世界都在看着约翰内斯堡
The entire world was looking at Johannesburg,

27
00:02:46,205 --> 00:02:48,408
因此，我们必须做正确的事情
so we had to do the right thing.

28
00:02:48,521 --> 00:02:51,581
随后政府成立了一个援救小组开始
The government then established an aid group that started to

29
00:02:51,681 --> 00:02:55,953
将这些外星人运送到 船下方的建立的临时营地里
ferry the aliens to a temporary camp set up just beneath the ship.

30
00:02:56,791 --> 00:03:00,864
我们并没有明确的计划 他们有数百万人
We didn't have a plan. There was a million of them.

31
00:03:01,364 --> 00:03:05,608
因此，临时的收容所就成为了隔离区
So, what was a temporary holding zone soon became fenced,

32
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:09,781
并开始实施军事化管理 而在之前，这是一个贫民窟
became militarized. And before we knew it, it was a slum.

33
00:03:10,284 --> 00:03:13,623
但事实是，没人真正知道 这究竟是什么地方
But the truth is, nobody really knew what this place was.

34
00:03:13,724 --> 00:03:16,760
在第九区有很多不为人知的秘密
There's a lot of secrets in District 9.

35
00:03:16,761 --> 00:03:23,937
片名：《第九区》

36
00:03:26,316 --> 00:03:29,447
起初，大家的注意力都集中在
At first, a lot of attention was given to...

37
00:03:29,648 --> 00:03:32,951
给予外星人一个适当的地位和保护
giving the aliens a proper status and protection.

38
00:03:33,429 --> 00:03:36,268
为了维持那些外星人生活 他们花了大量的钱
They're spending so much money to keep them here.

39
00:03:36,368 --> 00:03:39,407
而这些钱本可以花在其它地方
When they could be spending it on other things, but...

40
00:03:39,607 --> 00:03:43,548
但至少这把外星人和我们分开了
...at least they're keeping them separate from us.

41
00:03:47,324 --> 00:03:51,996
我想每个人都应该实际点 这些外星人将不可能回到他们原来的星球
l want to be realistic with everyone. The aliens will not be able to go home.

42
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,935
外星人会在这里长留下来
The aliens are here to stay.

43
00:03:55,505 --> 00:03:57,746
对于这件事，人们有各种解释
There were literally thousands of different theories

44
00:03:57,847 --> 00:04:01,851
至于船为什么无法操作 只能推测是
as to why the ship seemed inoperable, and what was speculated was that

45
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:05,091
指挥舱已经和主船分离了
the command module had detached itself from the main ship,

46
00:04:05,191 --> 00:04:07,595
然后，又莫名其妙地失踪了
and then somehow mysteriously became lost.

47
00:04:07,895 --> 00:04:13,127
它是自己堕落的还是按照预定程序？ 我不知道
Did it fall by itself or was it programmed? I don't know.

48
00:04:13,374 --> 00:04:16,269
认真检查影像镜头
Examination of the old video footage

49
00:04:16,471 --> 00:04:20,475
可以清楚地发现有一小块东西 从船上掉落下来
shows very clearly that a piece falls from the ship.

50
00:04:23,695 --> 00:04:26,136
我们搜索它 我们到处搜索它
We look for it. We look everywhere.

51
00:04:26,237 --> 00:04:28,839
这一小块堕落物引发了流血冲突
This piece that's falling caused us bloody problems.

52
00:04:29,037 --> 00:04:31,378
发现了很多隐藏的武器
More energy weapon caches found.

53
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,280
特种部队突袭了第九区
The Special task force conducted raids in District 9.

54
00:04:34,381 --> 00:04:37,821
有武器的地方就有犯罪 紧张状况不断上升，上升
Where there's a weapon, there's crime. Tensions rose, and rose.

55
00:04:37,921 --> 00:04:41,727
人们变得越来越不满 并最终引发了骚乱
People became more and more fed up, and eventually the rioting started.

56
00:04:41,828 --> 00:04:45,432
Tembisa的居民为了把外星人 从他们的小镇上赶走
Residents in Tembisa rioted for the third consecutive night

57
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:49,137
连续暴动了三个晚上
in an attempt to remove all the aliens from their township.

58
00:04:54,843 --> 00:04:57,846
我想他们一定要修好那艘船 他们必须离开
I think they must fix that ship and they must go.

59
00:04:57,948 --> 00:05:01,551
病毒，精心挑选一种病毒 把它释放到外星人附近
A virus, a selective virus. Release it near the aliens.

60
00:05:02,203 --> 00:05:05,005
他们必须离开 不管去哪，尽管走开
They must just go. I don't know where, just go.

61
00:05:05,206 --> 00:05:07,608
如果他们是来自其它 我们能理解的国家的话
If they was from another country we might understand.

62
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:09,610
但他们甚至都不是地球上的
But they are not even from this planet.

63
00:05:09,816 --> 00:05:12,421
政府已实施全国宵禁
The government have enforced a nationwide curfew.

64
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,729
外星人，那些大虾 他们夺走了我的妻子
The aliens, prawns, they take my wife away.

65
00:05:15,929 --> 00:05:19,538
这个贬损的词“大虾”用来指那些外星人 很明显，他暗指
The derogatory term Prawn is used for the alien, and obviously it implies

66
00:05:19,638 --> 00:05:23,677
那些以食腐为生的低等动物
something that is a bottom feeder, that scavenges the leftovers.

67
00:05:23,878 --> 00:05:26,116
我的意思是，你不能说 他们不像那种动物
I mean, you can't say they don't look like that.

68
00:05:26,216 --> 00:05:28,487
他们看起来就是那个样子，不是吗？ 他们看起来的确像大虾
That's what they look like, right? They look like prawns.

69
00:05:28,588 --> 00:05:33,161
外星人抢走了数额不明的现金，一个旁观者受伤了
The aliens made off with an undisclosed amount of cash. One bystander was hurt.

70
00:05:33,363 --> 00:05:36,672
在外星人看来那些娱乐的事情
What for an alien might be seen as something recreational,

71
00:05:36,772 --> 00:05:39,910
比如放火点燃汽车 让火车出轨
setting fire to a truck, derailing a train,

72
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:43,482
对人们而言 这些都明显是极端具有破坏性的行为
is for us obviously an extremely destructive act.

73
00:05:44,683 --> 00:05:48,086
他们会抢走走你穿着的运动鞋
They can take the sneakers you are wearing off you.

74
00:05:48,187 --> 00:05:51,690
他们会抢走你身上的一切 你的手机或者其它任何东西
They take whatever you have on you. Your cell phone or anything.

75
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:54,594
之后，他们会要了你的命
After that they kill you.

76
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:58,478
现在，20年后，公众的压力迫使政府
And now, after 20 years, public pressure had forced the government

77
00:05:58,579 --> 00:06:01,382
将这些外星人移出约翰内斯堡
to shift the aliens out of Johannesburg.

78
00:06:01,785 --> 00:06:05,429
他们受够了，他们希望 第九区搬走
They had had enough and they wanted District 9 to be moved,

79
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,832
并受到更多警力更强的控制
and more intensively policed and controlled.

80
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:11,705
因此，要实施这个大规模的驱逐行动 政府借助于MNU的力量
So, to enforce this mass eviction, the government turned to MNU.

81
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:14,276
欢迎你们，谢谢你们的到来
Welcome all and thank you for coming.

82
00:06:14,376 --> 00:06:17,276
请认真听这个简短的声明
Please listen very closely to this briefing.

83
00:06:17,482 --> 00:06:21,282
今天我们要开始一个非常复杂和棘手的行动
Today we start a very complex and delicate operation.

84
00:06:22,926 --> 00:06:27,103
这是MNU所执行过的最大的行动
This is the largest operation that MNU has ever undertaken,

85
00:06:27,203 --> 00:06:31,346
并且我们相信这次一定会执行地非常成功
and we believe that it is going to be undertaken successfully.

86
00:06:31,547 --> 00:06:34,751
这次我们要将180万大虾
It is to move 1.8 million prawns

87
00:06:35,052 --> 00:06:39,657
从他们现有的家第九区转移到 位于约翰内斯堡200公里之外的
from their present home in District 9 to a safer and better location

88
00:06:39,855 --> 00:06:43,664
一个更好更安全的场所
200 kilometers outside of Johannesburg City.

89
00:06:43,964 --> 00:06:46,773
我们在那里建造了一个更舒适的新环境 在哪里，大虾
We built a nice new facility where the prawn can go,

90
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,713
能够过得相对舒适 它们可以呆在那里
he can be comfortable, he can stay there...

91
00:06:49,914 --> 00:06:53,748
大虾远离了约翰内斯堡和南非的居民
The people of Johannesburg and of South Africa are going to live

92
00:06:53,887 --> 00:06:58,126
人们就可以过上快乐和安全的生活
happily and safely, knowing that that prawn is very far away.

93
00:06:58,598 --> 00:07:02,474
UIO协议要求我们在驱逐前24小时
UIO protocol dictates that we give the aliens

94
00:07:02,675 --> 00:07:06,279
给予外星人的驱逐通知
24 hours notice of our right to evict.

95
00:07:06,578 --> 00:07:11,989
今天，你们将宣布这一正式通知 让外星人们签订I-27协议
Today, you will serve these notices getting the aliens to sign I-27 form.

96
00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:17,026
MNU用来驱逐外星人的法律 实际上只是一个幌子
The legality that MNU is using to evict the aliens is simply a whitewash.

97
00:07:17,226 --> 00:07:22,031
我将任命地区负责人来直接指挥
I'm going to appoint a field officer to take direct command.

98
00:07:22,677 --> 00:07:24,805
维库斯・范德默尔.
Wikus Van De Merwe.

99
00:07:24,806 --> 00:07:28,409
人人都说维库斯不是一个非常机灵的孩子
Everybody always said that Wikus was not a very smart boy,

100
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:32,114
但他是一个非凡的儿子 是我的维库斯，正如...
but he was a wonderful son. That was my Wikus, just...

101
00:07:35,318 --> 00:07:39,122
感觉这是人生的一大步 谢谢你，皮耶特...史密斯先生
Feels like life on the big stage. Thank you Piet... Mr Smith.

102
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:43,811
我得抛开我女儿嫁给维库斯的事实
l had to put aside the fact that my daughter was married to Wikus.

103
00:07:44,286 --> 00:07:48,026
那并没有影响我提升他的决定
That didn't affect my decision to promote him.

104
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:52,900
这个升职几乎和我结婚的日子一样重大 嗯...当然还没有结婚那么重大
It's almost as big as my wedding day. You know... not as big.

105
00:07:53,537 --> 00:07:55,869
维库斯总给我亲手制作很多东西
Wikus was always making me things.

106
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,973
他说这这些东西都情深意长
He said that way they just mean so much more.

107
00:07:59,082 --> 00:08:02,120
有一天，他把这个纸钵留在了沙发上
He left this paper-mache bowl on the sofa one day

108
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:06,484
而我并没有看到，我坐下了 并...把它压扁了
and I didn't see it and I sat down, and I... kinda squashed it.

109
00:08:06,929 --> 00:08:10,804
为了调查，他们把他的所有东西都带走了
They took all his stuff away for the investigation, and...

110
00:08:10,928 --> 00:08:13,067
而我向他们把东西全都要回来了
I made them bring it all back.

111
00:08:13,568 --> 00:08:16,171
嘿，恭喜你，年轻人 谢谢，先生
Hey, congratulations, man! -Thanks, man.

112
00:08:16,272 --> 00:08:19,675
你去P7 维库斯！事情怎样了？
Okay, you're gonna go to P7. -Wikus! -How is it going, man?

113
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,519
这么办吧，P9归你 谢谢
Here's the shake. P9 for you. -Thanks.

114
00:08:22,663 --> 00:08:25,469
我并不是说他做的是对的，但
I'm not saying what he did was right, but...

115
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:28,437
他选择了那些给他的
he took the choices that were given to him.

116
00:08:28,538 --> 00:08:31,341
- 这是特雷特 - 方德斯瓦, 特雷特.  -你好！
This is Trent. Fundiswa, Trent. -Hi.

117
00:08:31,642 --> 00:08:34,545
方德斯瓦是我挑选来替补我的人
Fundiswa is the guy that I've selected to replace me.

118
00:08:34,651 --> 00:08:37,555
- 今天他能做到吗，啊？ - 我会做到的
If he can make it today, eh? -I'll make it.

119
00:08:37,756 --> 00:08:40,759
我现在只想每个观众
I just want everyone watching this right now

120
00:08:40,963 --> 00:08:44,401
能从中学到一些东西 你可能会认为
to learn from what has happened. -You would think...

121
00:08:44,701 --> 00:08:48,341
这些事情只会发生在别人身上 不会发生在自己身上
things like this would happen to somebody else, not to me.

122
00:08:50,144 --> 00:08:53,548
情况怎样了？队友 你有我的东西么
How is it going, man? Long time, mate. Have you got my stuff?

123
00:08:54,048 --> 00:08:56,651
喂，老板！  -最近怎样了？ 很好，老板
Hey, boss! -How is it going? -I'm all right, boss.

124
00:08:56,752 --> 00:08:59,355
好，好，这是方德斯瓦 他今天和我们一起训练
Good, good, this is Fundiswa. He is training with us today.

125
00:08:59,555 --> 00:09:02,358
我觉得我很讨厌他的工作方式
I think I was disgusted with the way he worked.

126
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,462
总是给别人暗示 和范德默尔
There was always just a hint of something not quite kosher

127
00:09:05,563 --> 00:09:08,365
- 不是很合适 - 没人知道下一步他会干啥
with mr Van De Merwe. -Nobody saw it coming at all.

128
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,188
我们都不知道他将要做什么
None of us had any idea of what he was doing.

129
00:09:11,388 --> 00:09:13,826
我想这是一个伟大的事情
l think it is a great thing to see that...

130
00:09:13,926 --> 00:09:16,131
这次由非军方人员管理
it's not the military guys in charge this time.

131
00:09:16,231 --> 00:09:18,466
不是说库布斯和他的那些牛仔不再重要了
Not to say that Koobus and his cowboys are not wanted.

132
00:09:18,568 --> 00:09:20,570
你们这些家伙一直很重要
You guys are always wanted.

133
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,506
现在你看到了吧 这些都是他手下
You see now, these are the cowboys.

134
00:09:24,908 --> 00:09:27,911
他们先射击，然后再回答问题
They shoot first, and then they answer the questions.

135
00:09:28,422 --> 00:09:31,491
对不起，这是否超出了弹药配给的数量
Sorry, is this above the allocated amount of ammunition?

136
00:09:31,592 --> 00:09:33,794
因为我看到你装了满满一袋子了
Because I see your pouches are full but...

137
00:09:33,894 --> 00:09:36,897
我想也许你应该跟上校谈
I think maybe you should speak to the colonel.

138
00:09:37,373 --> 00:09:41,073
F.A.G过来说我们拿了太多的弹药
F.A.G. over here says that we got too much ammunition.

139
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,822
不，我的意思是，库布斯，是那个
No, all I'm saying, Koobus, is that, you know...

140
00:09:43,922 --> 00:09:46,951
你应该找到一个让他们工作更有效率的办法
you should find ways of making you guys more efficient...

141
00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:49,254
听我说，你他妈的混小子！
Listen to me, you fuck!

142
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:51,358
赶紧让他滚远点
Get him outta my face.

143
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:55,962
无规矩不成方圆， 这世上我们都按照规矩行事
There are rules, we're all living by rules in this world.

144
00:09:56,143 --> 00:09:59,482
我认为他那种做法是不可原谅的
Well, l don't think he can be forgiven for what he did,

145
00:09:59,592 --> 00:10:02,622
- 因为这看起来就像是叛乱 - 我得开始出发了，Les
cause it's like a betrayal. -I've gotta get going, Les.

146
00:10:02,722 --> 00:10:06,762
我想我们应该剪掉这个采访，因为我们将...
I think we're gonna have to cut this interview, cause we're gonna go...

147
00:10:17,573 --> 00:10:20,777
离第九区12公里
12 KILOMETERS FROM DISTRICT 9

148
00:10:30,109 --> 00:10:33,917
带上你的弹药，走 我们走吧
Take your magazines, people. Come on, lets go.

149
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:38,592
大虾并没有财产领土的概念
The Prawn doesn't really understand the concept of ownership of property.

150
00:10:38,793 --> 00:10:42,362
因此，我们去到那里并说 听着，这是我们的土地
So, we have to come there and say: listen, this is our land.

151
00:10:42,473 --> 00:10:45,168
请，你会走开吗？
Please, will you go?

152
00:10:48,372 --> 00:10:50,774
自己一个人很难穿上防弹衣
It's difficult to put the vest on by yourself.

153
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,877
托马斯，你能帮帮我么？ 好的，头
Thomas, can you help me? -All right, boss.

154
00:10:52,983 --> 00:10:55,582
他们告诉我要把防弹衣穿在里面
They told me I was gonna get the vest inside the Casper.

155
00:10:55,693 --> 00:10:58,496
托马斯，看看那边还有防弹衣吗？
Thomas, just look on the side if there's a vest there?

156
00:10:58,597 --> 00:11:01,800
我只是担心我的家人 别担心防弹衣，一切都会很顺利的
I'm just concerned about my family. -Don't worry about the vest, it'll be fine.

157
00:11:01,939 --> 00:11:05,112
人权组织已经要求雇佣兵们在第九区
Rights groups have demanded that mercenaries should comply

158
00:11:05,212 --> 00:11:08,212
应该遵从UYO规则
with all YO regulations in District 9.

159
00:11:08,717 --> 00:11:11,957
我们正在第九区的入口出为你报道
We're coming to you from the entrance of District 9

160
00:11:12,057 --> 00:11:15,865
今天，多国联合部队将开始重新安置
as today, Multi National United sets out to relocate

161
00:11:15,965 --> 00:11:19,940
大约有180万外星居民
approximately 1.8 million alien residents from their homes.

162
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,012
人权组织正在保持密切观察
Human rights groups are keeping a watchful eye,

163
00:11:23,112 --> 00:11:26,180
因为会有一些可疑的虐待行为发生
as many suspect abuses might occur.

164
00:11:42,651 --> 00:11:45,951
我们正看到重装齐备的私人安全部队
We're seeing heavily armed private security forces

165
00:11:46,053 --> 00:11:48,555
正被部署到第九区
being deployed into District 9.

166
00:11:48,656 --> 00:11:51,858
并有大量的空中支援力量
Backed up by significant air support.

167
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,957
我们将进入一间一间小屋 并让他们在表格上签名
We'll go shack to shack and get them to sign the form.

168
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:06,861
第一个是EX247
First one EX 247.

169
00:12:07,499 --> 00:12:11,733
我们看到车队停下来了 行动马上就要开始
We're seeing the convoy stop. The operation is about to begin.

170
00:12:14,437 --> 00:12:16,840
集中精神
Just stay focused.

171
00:12:16,941 --> 00:12:20,144
准备好了吗，托马斯？ 是的，准备好了
Are you ready, Thomas? -Yeah. -Okay.

172
00:12:22,729 --> 00:12:25,589
那是一个信号吗？ 是的，伙伴们
Is that a signal? Okay, fellows.

173
00:12:25,801 --> 00:12:28,835
你和我们一起 祝你好运，
You stay behind us. Good luck, boy.

174
00:12:36,844 --> 00:12:39,847
别起来，他要去哪？ 这是什么？
Stay low! Where is he going? What is it?

175
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:43,552
很明显，安全性非常高
It's clear that security is very high.

176
00:12:43,653 --> 00:12:47,256
这只是全面驱逐行动的前奏
This is only the beginning of a total clamp down.

177
00:12:57,933 --> 00:13:01,130
我们是MNU探员 请开门！开门！
This is MNU agents. Open the door please! -Open up!

178
00:13:04,977 --> 00:13:07,410
喂！喂！喂...
Hello! Hello, hello...

179
00:13:08,118 --> 00:13:11,112
我是MNU的维库斯・范德默尔
This is Wikus Van De Merwe from MNU.

180
00:13:11,215 --> 00:13:13,620
我们在这里来发放驱逐通知的
We are here to serve you an eviction notice.

181
00:13:13,721 --> 00:13:16,523
你只需要将在这里签字就好了 滚开
You just put your scrawl there. -Fuck off!

182
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,970
好的！托马斯，慢着 我们已经取得了他的签字
All right! Thomas, hold it! We've got his scrawl there.

183
00:13:20,072 --> 00:13:23,475
因为它碰到它了 这也算
Because as he hit it, it counts as a scrawl.

184
00:13:24,877 --> 00:13:27,479
每次我们进去时，我们之间
First time we come in, there will always be a little bit

185
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,183
都会出现一些紧张的对立
of tension happening between us and them.

186
00:13:30,293 --> 00:13:32,896
嘿，你不能吃那个
Hey, you can't eat that, man!

187
00:13:33,001 --> 00:13:36,101
大虾喜欢吃橡胶 对他而言，这就像棉花糖一样好吃
The prawn likes to eat the rubber. To him it's like a marshmallow.

188
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,505
别，别！警卫！ 别这样对着着他
No, no! Guard! Don't confront him like that!

189
00:13:42,609 --> 00:13:46,011
看到那了吗？ 平静点
Did you see that? Right in the roost. Stay calm!

190
00:13:48,714 --> 00:13:51,717
这将成为一个问题 现在所有的大虾都出来了
This is gonna be a problem cause now all prawns are coming out,

191
00:13:51,823 --> 00:13:54,607
他们想弄清楚发生了什么 停止！停止！
they wanna see what's going on. Stop it! Stop it!

192
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,413
把我的东西拿过来 看，他们都聚起来了
Bring my kit. See, everybody is gathering now.

193
00:13:57,513 --> 00:14:00,345
别开枪，不然你将要把这里变成一个战场
Don't shoot or you're gonna turn it into a warzone!

194
00:14:00,452 --> 00:14:03,457
- 那是什么？那是催泪弹吗？ - 不，这是猫粮
What is that? Is that a tear gas? -No, it's cat food.

195
00:14:03,565 --> 00:14:05,995
这是猫粮 我只想引开他们的注意力
It is cat food. I just distract them.

196
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:11,400
其中一个袭击了大虾 他丢掉了他的手臂
One of them attacked the prawn and he's lost his arm.

197
00:14:14,303 --> 00:14:17,906
不，这不是我的房子 我不住在那
No it's not my house. I don't live here.

198
00:14:18,308 --> 00:14:21,111
那非常遗憾，你知道，这...
Well, that's a pity because, you know, this...

199
00:14:21,312 --> 00:14:25,315
这是一种很好的猫粮 但当然，这并不是你的房子
This is a nice cat food, you know. But of course, it's not your house.

200
00:14:25,516 --> 00:14:28,519
- 所以，我们要走了，把它给别人 - 是的！这是我的房子
So, we'll just have to go and give it to someone else. -Yes! It's my house!

201
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,808
我们要你在这里签名 现在你可以拿它了
We need you to sign here. Now you can take that...

202
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:34,410
好，停下
All right. Stop it!

203
00:14:34,754 --> 00:14:37,962
这种生物变得对猫粮具有特殊的爱好
The creatures became incredibly obsessed with cat food.

204
00:14:38,062 --> 00:14:42,490
一些像猫薄荷的东西，不过味道更重一点
Something about it, like catnip for cats. Only a lot more intense.

205
00:14:49,115 --> 00:14:52,486
喂？MNU，我们正在发放驱逐通知
Hello? MNU. We are here to serve eviction notices.

206
00:14:52,587 --> 00:14:55,190
什么是驱逐？
What is eviction?

207
00:14:55,894 --> 00:14:58,900
我们在地球上这个殖民地陷入困境
What we have stranded on Earth in this colony,

208
00:14:59,008 --> 00:15:02,271
根本上是因为人们不会独立思考
is basically the workers that are unable to think for themselves.

209
00:15:02,372 --> 00:15:05,174
他们只会听从命令 他们不掌握主动权
They will take commands, they have no initiative.

210
00:15:05,275 --> 00:15:07,675
他们丧失了一切领导能力
They've lost all the apt of leadership

211
00:15:07,776 --> 00:15:10,778
不管是什么导致的 我们推断这是疾病所致
through whatever cause. We presume illness.

212
00:15:13,482 --> 00:15:16,885
我曾在尼日利亚复合区执行过安全维护
I'm holding steady over Nigerian compound area.

213
00:15:27,497 --> 00:15:31,301
有贫民窟的地方就有犯罪 第九区也不例外
Where there's a slum, there's crime. And District 9 was no exception.

214
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:36,467
尼日利亚人诡计多端 其中一种就是猫粮骗术
The nigerians had various scams going. One of them was the cat food scam.

215
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,572
在那里他们把猫粮价格以非常高的价格 出售给外星人
Where they sold cat food to the aliens for exorbitant prices.

216
00:15:40,874 --> 00:15:44,877
你把钱放在这里 然后你就可以拿着这些东西离开了
You put the money here first. You don't get anything until you pay.

217
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,283
你想干什么？ 我将把你的嘴打扁
What are you trying to do? I'll chop your balls off.

218
00:15:50,668 --> 00:15:53,409
更别提种间卖淫了
Not to mention interspecies prostitution,

219
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,213
而且他们也给外星人出售武器
and they also dealt in alien weaponry.

220
00:15:56,312 --> 00:15:58,817
有车辆被劫持了 有商铺被打劫了
You have a car hijacking, there's a chop shop there,

221
00:15:58,918 --> 00:16:01,120
你可以看那 那里有一辆车
you can see that, that's somebody's car in there.

222
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,625
第九区的尼日利亚人的头是一个叫奥卑山卓的人
The nigerians in District 9 are headed by a man called Obesandjo.

223
00:16:05,826 --> 00:16:09,029
他是约翰内斯堡黑社会组织中一个非常有权势的人
He's a very powerful underground figure in Johannesburg.

224
00:16:09,205 --> 00:16:11,238
你一定不想跟这些人打交道
You don't want to play with these boys.

225
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:13,541
他们会把你剁碎的
They will cut you into pieces.

226
00:16:15,218 --> 00:16:18,221
那就是他们的头 好的，没问题
That's the boss there. OK, no problem.

227
00:16:18,624 --> 00:16:22,286
别看他 会惹麻烦的
Don't look at him! This is gonna cause problems.

228
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:29,372
好，下一个是，766
All right, next. 766, all right.

229
00:16:30,112 --> 00:16:32,884
MNU人员，请开门！
MNU agents. Open the door please!

230
00:16:33,184 --> 00:16:36,116
喔！天呀！这是什么？
Whoa! Jesus! What is it?

231
00:16:36,926 --> 00:16:40,020
检查另一面
Check the other side!

232
00:16:40,768 --> 00:16:43,406
总部，我是维库斯・范德默尔
Control, this is Wikus Van De Merwe.

233
00:16:43,507 --> 00:16:47,511
在JV766，我需要一只种群管制队伍
I need a population control team at JV 766 immediately, please.

234
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:51,344
检查另一边，托马斯 那里有40到50个蛋
Check the other side, Thomas! There is 40 to 50 eggs in here.

235
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:54,649
这正常吗？ 这真是一个让人惊异的发现
Is this normal? -This is an amazing find.

236
00:16:54,794 --> 00:16:56,998
我只能向你展示一二 它是如何工作的
l can just show you a little bit how it works.

237
00:16:57,098 --> 00:17:00,136
基本上，一头牛被悬挂在天花板上 就如你在这里所看到的这样
Basically, a cow is hung from the ceiling, you can see here.

238
00:17:00,237 --> 00:17:03,275
它已经所剩无几了，当然 因为所有的这些管道
Very little of it left, of course, because all these pipes

239
00:17:03,376 --> 00:17:06,379
都在给这些小虾蛋供送营养
supply the nutrition to the little prawn eggs.

240
00:17:06,716 --> 00:17:10,321
你可以干掉一个，我来告诉你 想要看吗？ 不用了，谢谢
You can do one, I can show you, want to see? -No, I'm fine.

241
00:17:10,422 --> 00:17:13,024
就这样，好了 这家伙再也没有营养供应了
There we go. Okay, no more nutrition to the guy.

242
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,965
最后，我们把氧气管也拔了
Then finally we take air back.

243
00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:19,069
这些小家伙可以睡会了
The little guy is gone to a nice little sleep now.

244
00:17:19,408 --> 00:17:22,644
你把这些东西拔出来 把它拔出来
You pop him out, there we go. Pop him out here.

245
00:17:22,848 --> 00:17:26,856
你可以留住这个。你可以把它当作 你这一次行动的纪念品
You can take that. You wanna keep it as a souvenir of your first abortion.

246
00:17:26,956 --> 00:17:30,190
- 你可以想象你亲手干掉了一个了 - 谢谢，头
You can feel like you did one of these here. -Thanks, boss.

247
00:17:31,893 --> 00:17:35,096
好了，来了，伙计们 这是火枪
Okay, here it comes, guys. This is the snake.

248
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:38,900
如果我们一次只灭一个蛋
If we were going to abort each egg one at the time,

249
00:17:39,001 --> 00:17:42,404
这会花上很长一段时间 所以，这样更合理些
it'd take a very long time. So, this makes a lot of sense.

250
00:17:42,821 --> 00:17:46,292
听到了吗？现在正传来砰砰的声音
You hear that? That's a popping sound that you're hearing.

251
00:17:46,392 --> 00:17:48,457
听起来就像爆米花
It's almost like a popcorn.

252
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:51,160
这些蛋就爆开了
What the egg does, it pops up.

253
00:17:51,261 --> 00:17:54,264
这些留在那里的小家伙 就爆破开了
The little guy, what's left of him, pops out there.

254
00:17:54,376 --> 00:17:57,541
所以，你们就听到了砰砰的响声
So that's the sound that you're hearing with the popping.

255
00:17:57,642 --> 00:18:00,845
哥们，你不需要这个 只有女人才戴那玩意
You don't need that, man. Only sissies wear that.

256
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,949
在这里喝得有些醉了？
Been drinking a little bit here, eh?

257
00:18:05,197 --> 00:18:09,192
你在对这电视做什么？这是什么？
What are you doing with this television set, sir? What's this?

258
00:18:09,707 --> 00:18:11,543
喂，对着镜头笑笑
Hey, smile for the cameras here.

259
00:18:12,044 --> 00:18:14,484
那是第一天的发现 那是一个大发现
That's a first day find. -That's a big find.

260
00:18:14,584 --> 00:18:18,452
看到没？特雷特，看看这个 这里到处都是武器
You see this? Trent, look at this! There's weapons all over here.

261
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:21,027
CK 5, 7572...
CK 5, 7572...

262
00:18:21,427 --> 00:18:24,430
一些枪很小
Some of the guns are small

263
00:18:24,531 --> 00:18:27,935
但你一旦被射中 后果也是不可设想的
but if it shoot you, it make a big mess.

264
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:36,393
MNU出于人道的目地要迁走外星人
MNU is trying to move the aliens for humanitarian reasons.

265
00:18:36,494 --> 00:18:38,696
但真正的重点 就如一开始所呈现的那样
But the real focus, just as it has been

266
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:41,400
焦点是武器
right from the beginning, is weapons.

267
00:18:41,702 --> 00:18:45,710
MNU是世界上第二大武器制造商
MNU is the second largest weapons manufacturer in the world.

268
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:48,851
我们以为我们拿起外星人的激光枪
We assumed that we'd be able to pick up the alien laser gun

269
00:18:48,953 --> 00:18:51,755
就能够射击 但事实上并非如此
and just be able to shoot, but it didn't work like that.

270
00:18:51,889 --> 00:18:54,526
因为，我们发现 他们的技术实际上
Because, as we discovered, their technology is actually

271
00:18:54,627 --> 00:18:58,231
整合了生物技术 要他们的DNA才能发动这些武器
engineered in a biological manner to interact exclusively with their DNA.

272
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:02,167
人类就无法使用 道理就是这样简单
It just doesn't work with humans. And it's as simple as that.

273
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,913
这画画的是一个大虾，三个人类
This is basically a guy, and there's 3 humans here.

274
00:19:06,014 --> 00:19:08,754
应该是在警告我们
Basically trying to make a warning, you know.

275
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:12,089
似乎正在说“三个人都被我干了 你们离我远点”
He's saying "I kill 3 humans, watch out for me."

276
00:19:12,328 --> 00:19:15,592
喂，别在自己的地盘上撒尿 退后，退后
Hey, don't urinate on your own bloody... get back, get back.

277
00:19:17,895 --> 00:19:21,097
我是维库斯，请求第一营护送
This is Wikus, requesting First Battalion escort, please.

278
00:19:22,682 --> 00:19:26,117
你想和他们谈 还是想和我谈
You want to talk to them or you want to talk to me?

279
00:19:26,318 --> 00:19:28,921
不，不是他们
No, not them!

280
00:19:35,128 --> 00:19:38,730
好的，伙计们，太谢谢了 是的，我知道，他有把铲刀
Okay, guys, thanks very much. Yeah I know, he had a spade.

281
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,853
看，我找到了
Look-I find some!

282
00:19:57,973 --> 00:20:02,357
我告诉过你了...这是 人类的东西，毫无用处
I tell you before... this is human technology, it is useless.

283
00:20:02,597 --> 00:20:05,761
只有我们的东西里面才包含着流体
Only our technology contains the fluid.

284
00:20:05,931 --> 00:20:09,745
这不是我们的东西？ 不，这只是垃圾
This is not our technology? -No, it's junk.

285
00:20:09,915 --> 00:20:11,917
继续寻找
Keep looking.

286
00:20:14,269 --> 00:20:16,541
我发现了一些东西
I find something.

287
00:20:17,192 --> 00:20:20,604
是的，这就是我们所需要的
Yes. This is what we need.

288
00:20:20,794 --> 00:20:23,247
做得很棒，小家伙
Good, little one.

289
00:20:27,651 --> 00:20:29,793
趴下
Get down!

290
00:20:38,942 --> 00:20:41,304
小心...等会...
Careful... wait...

291
00:20:41,905 --> 00:20:43,646
...那边
...there.

292
00:20:44,447 --> 00:20:47,400
为什么一定要那么长的时间
Why must it take so long?

293
00:20:47,611 --> 00:20:50,614
因为这相当困难...
Because it is very difficult...

294
00:20:50,973 --> 00:20:53,867
...很多环节都可能出错
...so much can go wrong.

295
00:21:05,927 --> 00:21:08,640
二十年的努力了
Twenty years of work.

296
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:12,424
我们的计划是不是已经准备好了？ 安静...听...
Our plan is ready now? -Quiet... listen...

297
00:21:13,845 --> 00:21:16,727
...他们过来了
...they are coming.

298
00:21:23,965 --> 00:21:27,829
你必须把这个藏起来 绝不能让他们找到它
You must hide this. They must not find it.

299
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:31,312
去开门并保持友好
Answer the door and be polite.

300
00:21:31,513 --> 00:21:33,915
不！你带上它
No! You take it.

301
00:21:34,908 --> 00:21:38,074
你看，这就是问题所在了 这就是团伙的标志
You see, this is the problem. This is the gang sign.

302
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,853
你看到这没？所以 看起来我们找到了
You see this? So again, looks like we have

303
00:21:40,954 --> 00:21:43,356
越来越多的帮派成员
more and more gang members.

304
00:21:43,457 --> 00:21:46,060
方德斯瓦，你先站在后面 你站在托马斯后面
Fundiswa, you just stay back. You stay behind Thomas.

305
00:21:46,361 --> 00:21:49,765
这里到处是MNU的人 肯定会被发现的
This place is swarming with MNU. I will be searched.

306
00:21:49,866 --> 00:21:53,870
我必须回到我孩子身边 别惹他们生气～礼貌点
I must get back to my son. Don't make them angry - be polite!

307
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:57,549
MNU探员，请开门
MNU agents, open the door please.

308
00:21:57,651 --> 00:22:01,054
你好，我们想要你... 这里没人
Hello? We would like you to... -Nobody is here.

309
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:04,749
不能这样 那完全不可接受
Okay, that's unexceptable. That is totally unexceptable!

310
00:22:04,964 --> 00:22:07,934
滚出来！滚出来！ 你这只蠢虾
Get out! Get out! You stupid prawn!

311
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,267
出来 来！走开，走开
-Get outside! -C'mon! Move! Move!

312
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:24,527
跪着 我进去看一看
On your knees! -I'm gonna have a look.

313
00:22:24,642 --> 00:22:26,708
呆在这里 这里
Just stay there! Right there!

314
00:22:26,808 --> 00:22:29,709
先生，我是来给你发放驱逐通知的
Sir, we have to serve you an eviction notice.

315
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:31,812
你不知道吗？ 不知道
Do you understand it? -No.

316
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,123
这是一个典型的帮派集会的场所 我可以看出来
This is a classic kind of gangsta shack, I can tell you.

317
00:22:35,224 --> 00:22:39,096
我们肯定能在这里发现武器 小心你的头，别碰到牛
We're gonna find weapons here. Watch your head, don't hit the cows.

318
00:22:39,432 --> 00:22:42,437
检查那些控制板 啊，你听到了吗
Just checking for panels. Ah, you hear that?

319
00:22:42,606 --> 00:22:45,075
是的，里面是空的
Yeah, it's hollow there.

320
00:22:45,946 --> 00:22:48,339
看，看那
See? Look at that!

321
00:22:48,685 --> 00:22:52,290
我还没看过这样的装置 它看起来就像一个...
I haven't see this type of setup. It's almost like a...

322
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,161
化学实验装备
chemistry type of a set.

323
00:22:55,663 --> 00:22:58,466
这里一定有些什么东西
It's gotta be something.

324
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:12,830
我不确定，这里有一些标志
l don't know, this has got the markings there of...

325
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:15,869
这毫无疑问是外星人留下的
...so it is definitely alien.

326
00:23:16,171 --> 00:23:19,774
但这不是武器 但我不相信它
But it's not a weapon. But I don't trust it.

327
00:23:22,879 --> 00:23:26,282
你没事吧？ 维库斯，你没事吧？
Are you all right? Wikus, are you all right?

328
00:23:31,889 --> 00:23:34,892
关了它，请关了它
Switch it off, please. Just turn it off.

329
00:23:34,993 --> 00:23:38,494
你会把这一段剪掉吧，那段它朝我喷射的
Are you gonna cut that part out, Trent, where it sprays me?

330
00:23:38,595 --> 00:23:40,797
是的，别担心 记得把那段剪掉
-Yeah, don't worry. -You cut that.

331
00:23:40,915 --> 00:23:44,219
我们刚在这里发现了一个危险的东西
We just found a dangerous object here.

332
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,936
里面有液体，而且我怀疑弄到人身上会引发伤害
It has a fuel in and I suspect it might leak onto people or cause damage.

333
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:52,943
所以我们把它装在里面，并带回实验室
So we just check that in and we take that down nicely to the lab.

334
00:23:53,043 --> 00:23:55,347
这不是武器 但是很危险
It's not a weapon but it's dangerous.

335
00:23:55,448 --> 00:23:58,855
我的直觉告诉我 他在这里隐藏了一些武器
He's got weapons somewhere here, my sense is telling me that.

336
00:23:58,955 --> 00:24:01,692
我们检查另一边 托马斯！  ―是的，先生
Lets check the other side here. Thomas! -Yes sir?

337
00:24:01,796 --> 00:24:04,189
托马斯，枪继续对着他 -好的，收到
Thomas, keep the gun on him. -OK, I got it sir!

338
00:24:04,298 --> 00:24:07,328
枪继续对着他，托马斯 这里有个武器
Keep the gun on him, Thomas, there's weapons here!

339
00:24:08,008 --> 00:24:11,446
哦，重大发现！ 重大发现，朋友们
Oh, this is Christmas! This is Christmas, my friends.

340
00:24:11,546 --> 00:24:14,109
这我见过的最大的发现
This is the biggest find that I've ever seen.

341
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,448
总部，维库斯・范德默尔
Control, come in. Wikus Van De Merwe,

342
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:19,351
请求第一营支援
requesting First Reaction Battalion.

343
00:24:23,956 --> 00:24:26,158
准备行动，伙计们
Stand by, guys!

344
00:24:26,844 --> 00:24:29,479
这种枪我从没见过 你见过这个么？
This gun I've never seen. Have you seen this?

345
00:24:29,581 --> 00:24:32,784
这真是太令人惊讶了！看看这枪 这是什么枪
This is amazing! Look at this gun. What gun is this?

346
00:24:33,121 --> 00:24:35,123
这无疑非常令人惊讶
This is absolutely amazing!

347
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,626
你在做什么？ 我想把这个给托马斯看
-What are you doing? -I wanna show this to Thomas.

348
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:39,729
但我想你说你应付不了它
But I thought you said you can't handle it.

349
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,832
不，我不是应付它 我只是展示它
No, I am not handling it, I'm just gonna show it.

350
00:24:41,934 --> 00:24:44,937
我不打算使用它 人类甚至不能使用
I'm not gonna use it, man. It doesn't even work with humans.

351
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:47,440
托马斯，看看这只枪
Thomas, look at this gun!

352
00:24:48,843 --> 00:24:52,446
- 那不是我的 - 你是个军火商？ -不是
-That's not mine. -You're a dealer, eh? -No.

353
00:24:53,996 --> 00:24:56,600
你听到了吗？ 你看到发生的一切吗？
You hear this, sir? You see what's happening?

354
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,361
第一营，我的朋友 你们知道这意味着什么
First Battalion, my friend. You know what that means?

355
00:24:59,463 --> 00:25:02,065
这意味着你逍遥法外的日子结束了
That means that your days of flaunting the law are over.

356
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:04,569
看一看，你看到那了吗？ 那是什么？
Have a look, you see that? What's that?

357
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,872
那是一支武装部队
That's a firing team.

358
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,900
过来
Come here!

359
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:38,201
维库斯！你没事吧？
Wikus! Are you all right?

360
00:25:38,302 --> 00:25:41,305
你以为你在干什么，阿？
Where do you think you're going, eh?

361
00:25:41,955 --> 00:25:45,027
在刀枪面前，你跑不了
You don't run away from the chopper. -No, no...

362
00:25:45,133 --> 00:25:48,760
你以为你能跑到哪？ 你想惹毛我？
Where do you think you're going? You wanna piss me off?

363
00:25:56,986 --> 00:25:59,587
库布斯呼叫基地
Koobus to base, come in!

364
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:04,364
我们有两个人受伤了 MNU警卫，MNU探员
I've got two people down. MNU guard, MNU agent.

365
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:08,568
我是福克斯特勒特・杨基， 5-3-0，收到？
It's the Foxtrot Yankee 5-3-0... copy?

366
00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:11,372
我们需要医护队，尽快
And we need a Med Evac ASAP.

367
00:26:11,473 --> 00:26:14,376
不用，没事，库布斯 我并不需要医护人员
No, that's fine, Koobus. I don't need a Med Evac.

368
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:16,947
维库斯，你的手烧伤了 你得...
Wikus, you burned your arm, you need to...

369
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:20,052
我就在这里治疗就行了，库布斯
I'll just treat it here, Koobus.

370
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:24,438
先生，我真的认为你必须看看医生 进医生或者啥的
Sir, I really think you must go to a doctor, a hospital or something.

371
00:26:24,538 --> 00:26:27,004
不，不 你得去医院检查一下
-No, no. -You should just get it checked out.

372

Did you see how fast that prawn was, Trent?

374
00:26:33,189 --> 00:26:36,259
是的，他相当的快 告诉你，他相当的快
-Yeah, he was fast. -He was fast, I promise you.

375

看，我修好它了 它能工作了

告诉过你别碰它
I told you not to touch that.

377
00:26:51,378 --> 00:26:53,380
有什么问题？
What is wrong?

378
00:26:53,481 --> 00:26:56,683
没事，出去放风去
Nothing. Go outside and watch for humans.

他死了
He's gone.

381
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:15,730
你没事吧？ 没事，就是感觉有点热
Are you okay? -Yeah, I'm just a bit hot.

382
00:27:15,831 --> 00:27:18,834
你们觉得热吗？ 你觉得热吗，特雷特？  不热
Are you guys hot? Are you hot, Trent? -No.

383
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,843
是的，怕热就别进厨房
Yeah, if you can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen.

384
00:27:24,856 --> 00:27:28,860
现在，你看看 到处都是小孩
Now you see. There's kids everywhere.

385
00:27:29,161 --> 00:27:32,064
这就是我的意思 这就是我们要摆脱他们的原因
This is what I mean. That's why we get rid of them.

386
00:27:32,165 --> 00:27:34,568
小家伙 是的，这就是我们为什么要让他们堕胎
-The little ones. -Yeah, that's why we abort.

387

让我们干脆一枪毙了他们 别，别，别，现在别开枪
Lets just shoot the little bastard. -No, no, don't shoot it now.

You almost poked my eye out with the fokkin' lollypop.

394

Come! Get down! I've had enough of your stupid games.

399
00:28:11,012 --> 00:28:13,439
你们想要做什么
What do you want?

400
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:16,041
我们是MNU的工作人员 我知道
We're from MNU. -I know.

Seems like we didn't understand each other there properly, eh?

413
00:28:55,699 --> 00:28:58,071
在这里你还有孩子

- 那小孩有办出生证明吗？ - 有的
Do you have a licence for that little one? -Yes.

415
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,516

There's a litter out here. This is dangerous conditions for your child.

416
00:29:04,616 --> 00:29:07,852

你说你想呆在这？

Fuck, look at this, Trent! Fuck it!

426
00:29:35,677 --> 00:29:38,939
托马斯，拿枪指着他 他是彻头彻尾的罪犯
Thomas, keep the gun on him. He is definitely a criminal!

427
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,243
这里简直是个电脑商店
He's got a whole computer shop here, man!

428
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:45,525
我是说，这里太让人惊讶了，这里显然是一个
You know, this is amazing. I mean, this is obviously...

you can see stolen computers now that he's decorating his place with.

430
00:29:49,305 --> 00:29:52,141
很明显，他没有许可做这事
Definitely he doesn't have the permit for this.

431

那小毛孩哪去了？

Are you okay, boss? -Fuck off, man! Fuck off!

I'm fine, I'm alright. I'm just a little bit dizzy.

能在那边停一下吗？

我想在那吃点东西

你确定你要吃这些？
Are you sure you should be having that?

445
00:31:01,711 --> 00:31:03,914
在你大吐那么长时间后
After your whole puking episode?

446
00:31:04,018 --> 00:31:07,615
我感觉很好多了...我想 我需要补充能量

If you can't do the job, I'll find someone who can!

496
00:35:35,611 --> 00:35:38,213
- 嗨，你们好！ - 很高兴又见到你们
Hi there! -Nice to see you again.

497
00:35:39,022 --> 00:35:42,792
这是不是意味着他要接管这次新的行动？
Does this mean he's in charge of this new operation?

498
00:35:42,894 --> 00:35:44,896
- 是的 - 那太好了
-Yes. -That's nice.

499
00:35:45,197 --> 00:35:48,400
维库斯！宝贝，你还好吗？
Wikus! Baby are you okay?

500
00:35:58,912 --> 00:36:01,714
好了，让我们来切蛋糕
Okay, let's cut some cake.

501
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:36,298
史密斯医生，请到405房间来
<i>Doctor Smith, please come to room 405, doctor Smith.</i>

502
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:45,619
- 是不是感染的特别严重？ - 这有很多腐肉
Is it badly infected? -There's a lot of suppuration.

503
00:36:45,819 --> 00:36:49,791
还有你应该知道我的右手一些手指甲变得很松动
Also you should know on my right hand some fingernails were coming loose.

504
00:36:49,893 --> 00:36:54,096
还有黑色的液体从我鼻子里流出来 并呕吐过黑色物
And I had a black fluid coming out of my nose, and sort of a black vomit.

505
00:36:57,701 --> 00:37:00,602
我的手怎么了 医生
What is happening to my arm, doctor?

506
00:37:00,704 --> 00:37:02,906
这是什么东西？
What is this thing?

507
00:37:03,007 --> 00:37:06,010
深呼吸 别紧张，平静点
Just breathe deeply. Calm down. Stay calm.

508
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:09,313
请叫我的妻子来
Sir, please tell my wife.

509
00:37:13,922 --> 00:37:17,987
请注意，所有11区的病人，迅速隔离
<i>Attention all medical containment evacuate ward 11.</i>

510
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:40,257
停下，女士
Stop right there, madam.

511
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:43,361
怎么了？ 你们要对他做什么？
What's going on? What are you doing to him?

512
00:37:44,163 --> 00:37:46,765
让我进去！
Let me through!

513
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:51,371
维库斯! 维库斯! 你们要把他带到哪去？
Wikus! Wikus! Where are you taking him?

514
00:38:07,931 --> 00:38:11,422
好，抓住他了？ 准备好了？抓住了
Okay, got him? Are you ready? -Got him.

515
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:19,331
我们决定不用麻醉剂
We decided not to use the anesthetic,

516
00:38:19,432 --> 00:38:23,036
因为我们不知道他会产生什么反应
the reason being we can't know how the subject will react.

517
00:38:35,848 --> 00:38:39,050
Fester医生  -什么事? 我想你应该看看这个
Doctor Fester! -Yes? -I think you should see this.

518
00:38:39,952 --> 00:38:43,355
我在他的夹克里发现了这个 这是外星人的吗？
I found it in his jacket. You think this is alien?

519
00:38:52,364 --> 00:38:54,767
停下，冷死了！去你妈的！
Stop, it's freezing! Fuck!

520
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:00,473
暴露16个小时
16 HOURS AFTER EXPOSURE

521
00:39:01,175 --> 00:39:03,578
这是哪？
Where is this?

522
00:39:07,246 --> 00:39:09,206
什么？
What?

523
00:39:12,924 --> 00:39:16,153
他们对这些大虾都做什么了？
What are they doing to these prawns?

524
00:39:18,636 --> 00:39:21,707
痛阈测试，第一次，DBX7
Pain threshold, test one, DBX 7.

525
00:39:28,555 --> 00:39:32,961
有很强的疼痛反应 说明神经系统已经形成
That's a strong pain reaction. That means the nerves have fused.

526
00:39:33,465 --> 00:39:36,666
意思是，几乎融为了一体
I mean, it's almost completely integrated.

527
00:39:36,803 --> 00:39:39,073
好吧，开始吧
Okay, do it.

528
00:39:39,675 --> 00:39:42,278
B5，测试AMR-B5
B5. Testing AMR-B5.

529
00:39:45,155 --> 00:39:48,182
清理障碍 现在就要，快点
Clear the range. Now, quickly!

530
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:51,985
转过来
Swing it around.

531
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:55,533
你们要做什么？ 们是锁着的
What are you doing? -The door is locked.

532
00:39:56,134 --> 00:39:58,537
你能握住这个吗？ 这是什么？
Can you grip that? -What is this?

533
00:39:58,638 --> 00:40:01,239
手扣进去 你们要我干啥
-Put it through. -Why are you doing this?

534
00:40:01,386 --> 00:40:05,191
预备开火，预备 你们要我射击那个？
-Standby for fire. Standby. -You want me to shoot that?

535
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:08,399
退回...开火
Stand back... and fire!

536
00:40:11,405 --> 00:40:13,442
很好
That's good!

537
00:40:13,542 --> 00:40:15,804
奏效了
It worked!

538
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:19,477
好了，谢谢你
All right, thanks very much.

539
00:40:19,579 --> 00:40:21,781
你知道我的妻子在哪吗？
Do you know where my wife is?

540
00:40:21,882 --> 00:40:24,885
我妻子知道我在这里吗？
Do you know if my wife knows where I am, sir?

541
00:40:27,837 --> 00:40:29,874
扣动扳机！扣动扳机
Pull! Pull!

542
00:40:29,975 --> 00:40:32,069
不，我不扣
No sir, I will not pull.

543
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:35,574
你刚说老婆怎么来着？ 去他妈的，你老婆
What did you say about your wife? Fuck your wife!

544
00:40:35,775 --> 00:40:38,378
- 扣动扳机！ - 我不扣！
Pull! -I will not pull.

545
00:40:39,393 --> 00:40:41,260
开火！
Fire!

546
00:40:45,165 --> 00:40:48,967
B7  -我可以扣动它 - 他说他能扣动它
B7. -I can pull it. -He says he can pull it.

547
00:40:52,754 --> 00:40:55,217
我说我能扣动它 你他妈...
I said I could pull it! You fuckin'...!

548
00:40:58,221 --> 00:41:00,223
B21
B21.

549
00:41:03,508 --> 00:41:05,745
过去，快点 过去
Move, hurry up. Move!

550
00:41:05,878 --> 00:41:08,949
- 现在，把它安置到铁链中间 - 放开我
Right, we want him in the center by the chain. -Get this off me.

551
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,052
快点！快点！
Come on! Time, time!

552
00:41:11,356 --> 00:41:15,262
把他妈的大虾弄走 我朝猪开枪就是了，我开枪就是了
Leave that fucking prawn, man, I will shoot at pig. I'll shoot, sir!

553
00:41:15,398 --> 00:41:18,627
听我说，我会为你朝猪肉开枪 我会开枪的
Listen, I'll shoot at pig again for you. I'll pull the trigger.

554
00:41:18,728 --> 00:41:22,232
但我不会朝大虾开枪 听到了吗？拿走这些该死的枪
But I'm not shooting at prawn, you hear me? Untie the fucking gun.

555
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:25,937
人手扣动B21，非常不错 成功了
B21 in human hand. That's good. It worked.

556
00:41:26,438 --> 00:41:29,840
拿走这枪 闪开
Just untie the gun, sir. -Stand by.

557
00:41:30,025 --> 00:41:33,725
听我说，不能拿生命做实验 他又没有惹你
Listen, you can't use the real guy, he didn't do anything to you.

558
00:41:34,802 --> 00:41:38,029
我要试试这个 所有的人闪开
I want to try this. Everybody standing by.

559
00:41:39,732 --> 00:41:43,135
准备好没？ 3，2，1，开枪！
Ready to go? Three, two, one, go!

560
00:41:48,294 --> 00:41:50,289
太不可思议了！
Amazing!

561
00:41:53,538 --> 00:41:56,609
好了 试验到此为止了
All right! I think that's all we need.

562
00:41:58,615 --> 00:42:01,587
先生们，我们时间不多了
Gentlemen, we are running out of time.

563
00:42:01,687 --> 00:42:04,860
这是变形的关键阶段
This is the key stage in the metamorphosis.

564
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,533
他的DNA是人类和外星人的完美结合
His DNA is in perfect balance between alien and human.

565
00:42:08,933 --> 00:42:12,009
但问题是，随着感染的扩大
And a problem is, as the infection spreads,

566
00:42:12,111 --> 00:42:15,114
这个转变会变得永久的 并且越来越没有活力的
the transition becomes permanent and less active.

567
00:42:15,218 --> 00:42:18,013
他将变成外星人的一员 变成一只大虾
He's going to turn into one of them. A prawn!

568
00:42:18,121 --> 00:42:20,181
他变成什么不重要
What happens to him isn't important.

569
00:42:20,282 --> 00:42:24,286
重要的是我们现在能从他身上获取什么
What's important is that we harvest from him what we can right now.

570
00:42:24,732 --> 00:42:27,936
这个躯体价值好几百万
This body represents hundreds of millions,

571
00:42:28,037 --> 00:42:31,472
甚至是价值几亿美元的生物技术
maybe billions of dollars worth of biotechnology.

572
00:42:31,645 --> 00:42:35,050
政府、公司所有人都会为
There are people out there, governments, corporations,

573
00:42:35,151 --> 00:42:37,954
这个东西拼个你死我活
who'd kill for this chance.

574
00:42:38,626 --> 00:42:41,722
他能挺得过这些程序吗？ 不，当然不能了
Will he survive the procedure? -No, of course not.

575
00:42:41,865 --> 00:42:45,559
我们要他所有的东西 组织，骨髓，血液
We need everything. Tissue, bone marrow, blood.

576
00:42:45,841 --> 00:42:49,579
这个过程会把他拆得一无所有
The procedure is gonna basically strip him down to nothing. -Please...

577
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,984
亲属们怎么安置？
What about next of kin?

578
00:42:52,085 --> 00:42:54,888
求求你帮帮我 别让他们这样做
Please help me. Don't let them do it.

579
00:42:54,988 --> 00:42:57,390
我会处理那些
I'll handle that.

580
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:02,069
好吧，开始吧 好的，谢谢
Okay, I say let's go. -Good, thank you.

581
00:43:12,792 --> 00:43:15,430
我不明白
I don't understand.

582
00:43:15,631 --> 00:43:20,002
一切都说不通 他只是手臂受伤了，爸
None of this makes any sense. He just hurt his arm, dad.

583
00:43:22,478 --> 00:43:25,572
医生们尽力了，亲爱的
The doctors are trying, sweetheart.

584
00:43:25,951 --> 00:43:28,748
尽一切所能在挽救他们的生命
Doing their best to save him.

585
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:32,953
我们已经开始从样本上收获材料了
We're starting to harvest material from the specimen.

586
00:43:33,054 --> 00:43:36,057
我们首先从软组织开始 先剖开胸膛
We'll start with the soft tissue first. Cut through the chest cavern.

587
00:43:36,158 --> 00:43:38,961
我们必须尽快取出心脏
We need to get the heart out as quickly as possible.

588
00:43:39,243 --> 00:43:42,544
一旦感染病毒了，病毒会飞快传播
Once it set the sinuosity, it just spread.

589
00:43:45,855 --> 00:43:49,657
你一向知道维库斯 他并不那么强壮
You know Wikus. He never was very strong.

590
00:43:51,634 --> 00:43:54,467
我来切开胸膛，取出心脏
I'll go through the chest, go straight into the heart.

591
00:43:54,574 --> 00:43:56,811
安静些 操你妈！
Be quiet, please. -Fuck you!

592
00:43:57,011 --> 00:43:59,314
我能见见他吗？
Can I see him?

593
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,549
还是不见好
Not a good idea.

594
00:44:08,801 --> 00:44:11,097
走开！操你妈！
Fuck off! Fuck you!

595
00:44:22,561 --> 00:44:24,657
操你妈！
Fuck you!

596
00:44:28,462 --> 00:44:30,664
放下刀
Drop the knife!

597
00:44:30,765 --> 00:44:33,768
走开否则我将割破他的喉咙
Move or I'll fuckin' cut his throat!

598
00:44:33,869 --> 00:44:36,070
好的，好吧！
Okay. All right!

599
00:44:38,674 --> 00:44:41,076
我会杀了他
I'll fuckin' kill him!

600
00:44:50,114 --> 00:44:53,117
你得对他放手了
You need to let go of him now.

601
00:44:56,227 --> 00:45:00,232
没事的，蒂尼娅 一切都会好起来的
It's okay, Tania. Everything will be okay.

602
00:45:08,851 --> 00:45:10,842
史密斯
Smith.

603
00:45:12,993 --> 00:45:15,020
什么时候？
When?

604
00:45:17,402 --> 00:45:19,663
快叫库布斯
Get Koobus.

605
00:45:56,291 --> 00:45:58,493
维库斯・范德默尔
<i>...Wikus Van De Merwe.</i>

606
00:45:58,594 --> 00:46:02,198
白人，男性 30多岁 高度危险人物
<i>White male, mid thirties. Is considered highly dangerous.</i>

607
00:46:02,399 --> 00:46:05,502
嘿，宝贝 维库斯，是你吗？
-Hey baby. -Wikus, is that you?

608
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:08,026
Smith夫人？ 你竟敢给我打电话！
-Mrs. Smith? -How dare you phone us!

609
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:11,199
你们这些人在我家里干嘛？ 不干你的事
What are all these people doing in my house? -It's none of your business.

610
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:14,375
我得和蒂尼娅谈谈 马上走开，这是我的房子
I need to speak to Tania straight away, please. It's my house.

611
00:46:14,476 --> 00:46:17,679
你用的是我的电话，我是...什么？
This is my phone that you're using, mam. I'm fokkin'... what?

612
00:46:17,987 --> 00:46:20,218
他想给我打电话
He tried calling me.

613
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:23,321
Anton，是我，快接电话
Anton, it's me! It's me! Accept the call!

614
00:46:23,422 --> 00:46:27,225
我们都有13年的交情了
I've been friends with you for fokkin' 13 years, man!

615
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:30,129
滚开！你在看什么？ 滚远点
Fuck off! What are you watching? Fuck off!

616
00:46:30,344 --> 00:46:33,347
我们都认为这是出于好意 因为他需要帮助
We all thought it was for the best because he needed help.

617
00:46:33,448 --> 00:46:35,450
需要特殊医疗帮助
A special medical help.

618
00:46:35,551 --> 00:46:38,354
而如果他继续逃亡的话就无法得到 医疗帮助
And he wasn't gonna get that as a fugitive.

619
00:46:44,038 --> 00:46:48,102
他已经成为世界上 最具商业价值的人了
He became the most valuable business artifact on Earth.

620
00:46:50,416 --> 00:46:53,322
他是唯一一个能够
He was the only human who had ever...

621
00:46:53,522 --> 00:46:57,624
成功和外星基因结合 并还活着的人
successfully been combined with alien genetics and remained alive.

622
00:46:57,863 --> 00:47:01,864
不过他真正的价值在于 他能够使用外星武器
But his real value was that he could operate alien weaponry.

623
00:47:09,922 --> 00:47:11,622
你好
Hello.

624
00:47:11,723 --> 00:47:15,526
能给我些奶酪汉堡和泡菜吗？
Can I get some cheese burgers and one large sauerkraut, please.

625
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:18,404
我们中断这个节目并给大家带来一个 惊人的消息
<i>We interrupt this program to bring you breaking news.</i>

<i>after prolonged sexual activity with aliens in District 9.</i>

629
00:47:29,126 --> 00:47:32,429
一派胡言 我得给我的经理人打电话
This is nonsense. -I have to call my manager.

630
00:47:32,666 --> 00:47:35,093
这简直是一派胡言 你本该受命于我的
That is totally untrue. You are legally obliged to serve me!

631
00:47:35,194 --> 00:47:37,196
已经导致他的身体发生变形
<i>...is causing bodily disfigurement.</i>

632
00:47:37,297 --> 00:47:40,300
我只想要买我的汉堡 别听他们胡说
If I could just buy my burger, please. Don't listen to them!

633
00:47:40,415 --> 00:47:43,079

总部，这里还没有维库斯的消息
<i>Control, there's no sign of mr Van De Merwe.</i>

644
00:48:58,767 --> 00:49:02,204
全世界的人都在关注他
The entire world was watching him.

645
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:06,949
广播、电视台到处都在报道他
He was on every radio station, every image on television,

646
00:49:07,151 --> 00:49:10,154
到处都是他的照片
anything you could find had his face on it.

647
00:49:10,259 --> 00:49:14,299
他已经无路可逃 他只有一个地方可取
So he had nowhere else to go. He ended up hiding in the one place

648
00:49:14,401 --> 00:49:18,099
他知道没人会去找他

00:50:41,103 --> 00:50:43,705
下周给你，我保证
I pay you next week, I promise.

652
00:50:43,906 --> 00:50:47,910
没钱，什么都不给 该死的大虾，这不是慈善
No money - you get nothing. Fucking prawn, this isn't charity.

653
00:50:50,912 --> 00:50:54,179
你好，我想买一些肉
Hello, I'd like to buy some meat, please.

654
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:56,382
嘿，一个人！
Hey, a man!

655
00:50:56,524 --> 00:51:00,499
是的，你这里有汉堡 或者牛排卷吗？
Yes, have you got a hamburger, or a steak roll?

656
00:51:00,799 --> 00:51:03,236
难道这里看起来像是汉堡店？
Does it look like a hamburger shop?

657
00:51:03,336 --> 00:51:05,676
你要什么肉？ 羊肉？
Which one do you want? Goat?

658
00:51:05,776 --> 00:51:08,612
快点，快点 我可没闲工夫
Come on, come on, I don't have the whole day.

00:51:09,151 --> 00:51:12,156
那是猫粮吗？ 是的，那是猫粮
Is that a cat food there? -Yeah, yeah, it is.

660
00:51:12,356 --> 00:51:14,753
那来点猫粮
I'll have some of that, guys.

661
00:51:35,973 --> 00:51:37,975
我操！
Fuck, man!

662
00:51:58,109 --> 00:52:00,751
喂，喂
Hello, hello?

663
00:52:04,053 --> 00:52:06,847
宝贝是你吗？蒂尼娅？
Baby is that you? Tania?

664
00:52:07,562 --> 00:52:10,197
天呀，希望一定是你
God, please let it be you.

665
00:52:10,499 --> 00:52:12,701
是的，是我

666
00:52:14,041 --> 00:52:16,644
我真是太高兴了 你给我打电话了，宝贝
I'm so happy you called me, baby.

667
00:52:16,882 --> 00:52:20,246
维库斯，听我说 -好的
-Wikus, listen to me. -Okay.

668
00:52:21,356 --> 00:52:25,024
我有些事情想对你说 而这真难开口
I have something to say to you, and it's not gonna be easy.

669
00:52:25,296 --> 00:52:28,370
不，不，看...听着，宝贝 在你说任何事情前...
No, no, look... listen baby, before you say anything...

670
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:32,277
你父亲不站在我这边 而且他欺骗了你
Your father is working against me, but he's lying to you.

671
00:52:32,677 --> 00:52:35,573
我从来没有跟这些
I did not have sex with one of these...

672
00:52:35,774 --> 00:52:37,976
和那些外星人发生过性关系
...fokkin' creatures, man!

673
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:40,423
我绝不会和那种东西
I would never have any kind of

674
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:43,426
产生任何形式的冲动和性行为
pornographic activity with a fokkin' creature!

675
00:52:43,598 --> 00:52:48,865
他们说你变成了他们的一员 我实在无法接受这点...
They say that you're becoming one of them. I can't do this...

676
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:52,037
宝贝，求你了，请别放弃我
Baby please, don't give up on me.

677
00:52:52,349 --> 00:52:55,487
千万别放弃我 因为我可以...
Don't give up on me baby, because I can...

678
00:52:55,788 --> 00:52:58,426
我想再次见到你，宝贝
I want to see you again, baby.

679
00:52:58,595 --> 00:53:01,536
我的手会好起来的 而且我会再次见到你的
I'm gonna fix my arm and I'm gonna see you again,

680
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:04,603
到时我要亲吻你 要把你搂在怀中
and I'm gonna kiss you and I'm gonna hold you again.

681
00:53:04,704 --> 00:53:07,907
我也希望你能再一次抱着我
I also want you to hold me again.

682
00:53:10,084 --> 00:53:12,183
宝贝
Baby?

683
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:15,918
宝贝
Baby?

684
00:53:29,423 --> 00:53:31,822
嗨，嗨，老兄！
Hey! Hey man!

685
00:53:52,242 --> 00:53:54,244
好的...
...

686
00:54:18,769 --> 00:54:22,172
我们现在直接搜索那个位置
<i>We are on tracking directly to the location.</i>

687
00:54:22,373 --> 00:54:25,777
收到，我会给你一些支援备用的直升机
<i>Roger that. I'll send you a couple of choppers for backup.</i>

688
00:54:45,176 --> 00:54:47,178
你！
You!

689
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:49,982
你想干嘛？
What do you want?

690
00:54:53,686 --> 00:54:57,056
总部，发现一个目标移动到66
<i>Come in, control, there is our target moving to 66.</i>

691
00:54:57,257 --> 00:55:00,861
- 你得走了 - 求你了，我需要你的帮忙
-You have to go. -Please, I need your help.

692
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:06,172
- 我们来玩捉迷藏 - 好的！好的！   不，退后
We're gonna play hide and seek. -Yes! Yes! -No, get back.

693
00:55:06,273 --> 00:55:09,676
你应该让我藏起来？ 告诉我你最喜欢藏在哪？
You want me to hide? Show me your favorite hiding place.

694
00:55:09,877 --> 00:55:13,881
走吧，求你了，离我们远点
Please, just go. Leave us alone.

695
00:55:14,494 --> 00:55:17,427
不，求求你了，我得藏起来
No, please, I need to hide.

696
00:55:18,202 --> 00:55:20,439
他们会杀了我的
They wanna kill me.

697
00:55:20,539 --> 00:55:24,378
我只需要在这里藏起来 就5分钟，好吗？
I just need to hide in here, sir, for 5 minutes, okay?

698
00:55:34,833 --> 00:55:37,837
这是什么？ 你们在这里干什么？
What is this? What are you doing here?

699
00:55:37,939 --> 00:55:40,942
- 我记得你  - 什么都没 - 你一定能藏在什么地方
-I remember you. -Nothing. You must hide somewhere else.

700
00:55:41,043 --> 00:55:43,480
先生...求求你了 你得帮帮我
Sir... please sir, you have to help me.

701
00:55:43,581 --> 00:55:46,383
我流血不止 他们要杀了我
I'm losing blood, they're trying to kill me.

702
00:55:56,895 --> 00:56:00,698
只有一种东西能让那个发生...
Only one thing that could make that happen...

703
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:05,202
快！我们得把他藏起来
Quick! We have to hide him.

704
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:10,709
你...，下去
Now you... get down there.

705
00:56:23,665 --> 00:56:26,868
流体在哪？ 你们拿它干什么了？
Where's the fluid? What did you do with it?

706
00:56:27,069 --> 00:56:28,935
求你了！ 你拿走了它...
-Please! -You took it...

707
00:56:29,037 --> 00:56:31,038
我不知道你 在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about!

708
00:56:31,139 --> 00:56:34,942
...我知道你拿走了它 我可以看出你身上发生的反应
...I know you did. I can see what's happening to you.

709
00:56:35,144 --> 00:56:37,746
告诉我它在哪里？
Tell me where it is.

710
00:56:39,159 --> 00:56:41,362
好的，好的
Alright, alright.

711
00:56:41,663 --> 00:56:44,897
它是不是一个长容器里面的黑色液体？
Was it a black fluid in a flask container?

712
00:56:44,998 --> 00:56:47,401
是的，就是它，是的！
Yes, that's it. Yes!

713
00:56:47,775 --> 00:56:51,146
我把它没收了 实验室的人拿走了它
I confiscated it and the guys at the lab took it.

714
00:56:51,247 --> 00:56:54,250
它肯定在MNU MNU的人拿着他
It will be at the MNU. MNU has it.

715
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:06,166
那是什么东西？
What is this?

716
00:57:06,268 --> 00:57:09,671
- 你毁掉了一切 - 那东西现在在哪？
-You ruined everything. -Where is this?

717
00:57:13,627 --> 00:57:16,122
这是你的房子？
Is that your shack?

718
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:19,293
这一切的东西都在你房子下面？
This whole thing is under your shack?

719
00:57:19,437 --> 00:57:22,971
20年来，你一直在这里放 你那些重要的东西
For 20 years you've... had this fokking' thing in here?

720
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:26,751
天呀，这是严重违法的
Jesus, this is very illegal.

721
00:57:26,951 --> 00:57:31,591
我在说，这简直是个大发现 真希望他们能逮你个正着
I mean, this is a find, you know. I wish they catch you with this.

722
00:57:34,695 --> 00:57:36,997
能量从这里进去
Fuel goes in here.

723
00:57:37,098 --> 00:57:39,601
够了！安静！
That's enough! Quiet!

724
00:57:39,702 --> 00:57:41,904
然后我们就可以飞走了
Then we fly away.

725
00:57:42,005 --> 00:57:44,408
我说安静 我们不能相信他
I said quiet! We cannot trust him.

726
00:57:44,587 --> 00:57:48,561
他说的能量是什么？ 你们打算开动飞船吗？
What is he saying about the fuel? Are you trying to start this thing?

727
00:57:48,661 --> 00:57:51,933
你们这些傻瓜要开动飞船然后飞走？
Are you little fuckers trying to start this and get away?

728
00:57:52,034 --> 00:57:54,036
算了吧
Never mind.

729
00:57:54,138 --> 00:57:56,472
你们这些鬼鬼祟祟的大虾
Yeah, you sneaky fokkin' prawns.

730
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:59,376
太糟了，我本来可以治好你的
Too bad. I could've fixed you.

731
00:57:59,516 --> 00:58:03,356
什么？你说的治好是什么意思？
What? What did you say... about the fixing?

732
00:58:03,556 --> 00:58:05,922
你说你能治好我是什么意思
What do you mean you could fix me?

733
00:58:06,023 --> 00:58:09,026
算了吧，没用了，太晚了
Forget it. It doesn't matter, it's too late.

734
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:12,338
不，听着！听着 你是说你可以
No, listen! Listen. Are you saying that you can...

735
00:58:12,439 --> 00:58:15,080
把我这只大虾手变成人手？
turn this prawn hand into a human hand?

736
00:58:15,181 --> 00:58:17,472
你可以让变回人类？
You can make me human again?

737
00:58:17,573 --> 00:58:21,677
我们主船上有医疗设备能够治好你的病
We have medical machines on the mothership that can fix you. Yes.

738
00:58:21,879 --> 00:58:25,382
我们可以开这个小船飞到上面去
We can use this ship to fly up there.

739
00:58:25,967 --> 00:58:28,572
那太好了！ 你们真是太聪明了！
That's fantastic! You guys are brilliant!

740
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:31,770
我一直都认为大虾们很聪明 那我们开工吧
I always thought that prawns were intelligent. Let's do it.

741
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:34,372
我没有流体
I don't have fluid.

742
00:58:34,674 --> 00:58:39,078
我可以治好你，也能飞走 但我没有流体
I could fix you and I could fly away. But I don't have fluid.

743
00:58:39,425 --> 00:58:41,464
对，好的
Right, okay.

744
00:58:41,664 --> 00:58:44,067
好吧，我来告诉你怎样 我们为什么不...
All right, I tell you what. Why don't we...

745
00:58:44,168 --> 00:58:47,171
再冒险一次，我们再去收集一些
go risk it some more? Let's go collect some up.

746
00:58:47,372 --> 00:58:51,176
我们花了20年才收集到那一点
It took twenty years to collect that amount.

747
00:58:51,818 --> 00:58:54,356
我操！操！
Fuck, man! Fuck!

748
00:58:54,689 --> 00:58:58,320
操！唯一的那一点还被我没收了？
Fuck! The only one that exists is the one I confiscated?

749
00:58:58,421 --> 00:59:00,223
是的
Yes.

750
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,295
这是地下四层
It's four stories underground.

751
00:59:09,352 --> 00:59:13,186
- 他为什么一直那样看着我？ - 他喜欢你
Why does he keep looking at me like that? -He likes you.

752
00:59:13,387 --> 00:59:15,590
我们是同类
We are the same.

753
00:59:16,999 --> 00:59:20,665
我们不是同类 我们他妈的不是同类
We're not the same. We're not the fokkin' same.

754
00:59:27,672 --> 00:59:33,078
只剩一个办法让我们脱离这个困境了 我们得从MNU手上拿回流体
There is a way out of this. We get the fluid back from MNU.

755
00:59:35,035 --> 00:59:37,908
是呀，然后怎么办？ 然后我们两两都归西？
Yeah, and what then? Then we both die, eh?

756
00:59:38,042 --> 00:59:40,947
我们都会死 这简直是个自杀行动
Both of us dead. That's a suicide mission, man.

757
00:59:41,047 --> 00:59:44,484
你能不能别给我灌输这些愚蠢的主意
Can you not fill my head with that sort of nonsense?

758
00:59:45,686 --> 00:59:48,689
变形正在加速
The transformation is accelerating.

759
00:59:50,893 --> 00:59:53,896
你时间已经所剩无几
You don't have much time.

760
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:21,822
暴露56小时后
56 HOURS AFTER EXPOSURE

761
01:00:45,146 --> 01:00:47,748
操！操！操
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

762
01:01:11,590 --> 01:01:13,456
喂
Hello.

763
01:01:13,557 --> 01:01:16,560
维库斯？ 蒂尼娅！宝贝
-Wikus? -Tania! Baby...

764
01:01:16,867 --> 01:01:19,730
你没事吧？ 哦，天呀！谢天谢地...
-Are you okay? -Oh God! Thank God...

765
01:01:20,406 --> 01:01:22,804
你在哪？
Where are you?

766
01:01:23,005 --> 01:01:25,007
我在...
I'am...

767
01:01:26,452 --> 01:01:31,026
我知道我父亲对我撒了谎 我知道他在试图保护我
It's not like my father said. I know he was lying to protect me.

768
01:01:33,098 --> 01:01:36,071
我不知道该相信什么了
I just don't know what to believe anymore.

769
01:01:36,171 --> 01:01:38,575
宝贝，我懂！但是请听我说
Baby I know, but listen to me.

770
01:01:38,675 --> 01:01:42,911
这一切都是谎言，我向你发誓 他所说的一切都是谎言
It's all lies, I swear to you. Everything he said to you is lies.

771
01:01:43,819 --> 01:01:47,020
我知道 什么？什么？
-I know. -What? What?

772
01:01:48,094 --> 01:01:51,099
我相信你，维库斯 我只希望你回来
I believe you, Wikus. I just want you back.

773
01:01:51,301 --> 01:01:54,173
我想要让一切都回到它应有的状态
I want everything back the way it was.

774
01:01:54,374 --> 01:01:57,312
这...宝贝，这也是我想要的
That's... baby, that's what I want.

775
01:01:57,413 --> 01:02:00,214
太好了 真的太好了
That's great! That's great news.

776
01:02:00,316 --> 01:02:03,519
我可以让一切回到过去那样 如果你还要我的话
I can make it the way it was. If you take me back.

777
01:02:04,493 --> 01:02:07,961
怎样？我们怎样才能回到过去？
How? How can we go back?

778
01:02:11,774 --> 01:02:14,914
我有个计划 我知道怎么治好它
I have a plan. I know how to fix it.

779
01:02:15,014 --> 01:02:17,484
我知道怎么治好自己的病
I know how to fix myself.

780
01:02:17,584 --> 01:02:20,624
然后我又是我了 我们将会重新在一起
And it will be me. And we'll be back together.

781
01:02:20,825 --> 01:02:24,229
你发誓？ 我想你发誓，宝贝
-You promise me? -I promise you, baby.

782
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:27,671
别放弃我，好吗？
Don't give up on me, okay?

783
01:02:27,772 --> 01:02:31,045
因为我还没放弃你，好吗？
Because I haven't given up on you. All right?

784
01:02:31,246 --> 01:02:33,352
我永远不会放弃你的
I won't.

785
01:02:33,453 --> 01:02:36,656
我爱你 我也爱你
-I love you. -I love you too.

786
01:02:38,925 --> 01:02:42,163
告诉我你已经定位到他了
Tell me you got a fix on him. -D9.

787
01:02:49,271 --> 01:02:52,484
我们的星球有几个月亮呢？
How many moons does our planet have?

788
01:02:56,989 --> 01:02:59,151
7个
Seven.

789
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:03,665
这个地球只有一个
This planet only has one.

790
01:03:04,336 --> 01:03:08,570
我等不及见到我们的星球了 它比地球还大，是吗？
I can't wait to see our planet. It's bigger than this one, isn't it?

791
01:03:08,721 --> 01:03:10,887
大多了
Enough.

792
01:03:11,724 --> 01:03:14,135
我们现在可以回家了？
We go home now?

793
01:03:14,546 --> 01:03:18,049
还不能回家，不能
Not home. No.

794
01:03:18,709 --> 01:03:22,292
这个地方我们必须去一趟
This is where we must go.

795
01:03:23,563 --> 01:03:27,358
看到那里的帐篷了吗？ 那是我们的
See that tent there? That might be ours.

796
01:03:27,978 --> 01:03:30,821
我想回家
I want to go home!

797
01:03:32,063 --> 01:03:37,928
我们回不了家了 再也回不去了
We can't go home. Not anymore.

798
01:03:43,487 --> 01:03:47,458
喂，你不会想去那里的 那里一定不好
Hi, you don't wanna go to the tents, they are not better.

799
01:03:47,561 --> 01:03:49,865
那里比这里还小
They're smaller than the shacks.

800
01:03:49,965 --> 01:03:52,803
实际上，它更像是一个集中营
Actually, more like a concentration camp.

801
01:03:52,903 --> 01:03:57,001
如果我能帮你拿回黑色流体 然后怎样？
If I can get you that black fluid, what happens then?

802
01:03:57,403 --> 01:03:59,905
我们进入母船
We go up to the mothership.

803
01:04:00,118 --> 01:04:03,147
然后你可以启动那玩意？ 是的
And you can start that thing? -Yes.

804
01:04:04,127 --> 01:04:07,999
好的，那么让我们说清楚了 这手将会回到...
Okay, so just to be clear: this is gonna go back...

805
01:04:10,907 --> 01:04:14,580
这手将会回到原来的样子
This is gonna go back to human like this.

806
01:04:15,081 --> 01:04:18,320
我可以回家，你也可以回家
I can go home and then you can go home.

807
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:21,292
你可以带上你的小孩 你可以带上所有的大虾
You can take your boy, you can take all the prawns,

808
01:04:21,392 --> 01:04:23,792
如果我能带来流体的话，对吗？
if I can get you that fluid, right?

809
01:04:23,894 --> 01:04:28,698
你说过这是一个自寻死路的任务 你可能是对的
You said it was a suicide mission. Maybe you were right.

810
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:33,304
我们没有武器 他们一看到我们就会开枪
We have no weapons. They'll shoot us on sight.

811
01:04:35,087 --> 01:04:37,756
看，看... 克里斯多夫
Look, look... Christopher...

812
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:40,986
我知道到哪里可以找到武器
I know where we can get weapons.

813
01:04:48,948 --> 01:04:51,344
喂，伙计们，你们好
Hi guys. Hello.

814
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:56,522
我想买点武器
I would like to buy some weapons, please.

815
01:04:57,464 --> 01:05:00,667
你究竟是怎么做到的？
How did you do this like that?

816
01:05:00,904 --> 01:05:03,997
和外星人来后背式
A doggie style with the demon.

817
01:05:04,178 --> 01:05:06,248
我喜欢它
I love it!

818
01:05:06,349 --> 01:05:10,012
一个勇敢的白人男人 哦？ 当时戴安全套了吗？
One brave white man, eh? Were you wearing a condom?

819
01:05:10,992 --> 01:05:13,987
我想要买武器，拜托了
I need to buy weapons, please.

820
01:05:14,632 --> 01:05:18,638
你和我都知道里面都是些非法武器
You and I both know that there are illegal weapons inside here.

821
01:05:18,838 --> 01:05:22,268
我带来了钱 我想那些武器
I have money and I would like to buy some of those...

822
01:05:30,877 --> 01:05:32,679
坐下

823
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:50,698
谢谢你了，先生，占用你时间了 非常感激你的接见
Thank you sir for your time. Thank you very much for seeing me.

824
01:05:52,004 --> 01:05:55,074
我想买些武器
I would like to buy some weapons.

825
01:05:55,276 --> 01:05:59,078
AK-47，一些手榴弹 催泪瓦斯也行
AK-47, some grenades... maybe tear gas canisters.

826
01:05:59,349 --> 01:06:02,456
我知道你还有些武器在那里 我..
I see you have limpet mines here aswell, and I..

827
01:06:02,556 --> 01:06:06,631
还看到过你们有外星人的武器 非常强大的武器
also see you guys have alien weapons there, which is great!

828
01:06:06,731 --> 01:06:09,603
我能买一两件这种武器吗？
If I could have one or two of those.

829
01:06:09,705 --> 01:06:12,942
我带来了钱，好吗？ 现在，我...
I have money, okay? Now, I'm...

830
01:06:17,755 --> 01:06:20,158
先生，求你了，先生！
Sir! Please, sir!

831
01:06:20,459 --> 01:06:22,596
我听说过你
I've heard about you.

832
01:06:22,697 --> 01:06:25,700
你哪里变形了？ 给我看看
Where do you have it? Show me!

833
01:06:25,902 --> 01:06:27,772
哦，妈的
Oh, shit!

834
01:06:28,473 --> 01:06:30,801
过来，过来
Come here. Come.

835
01:06:36,823 --> 01:06:39,452
别，别...请别这样
No, no... don't please!

836
01:06:44,058 --> 01:06:47,061
你们这是干嘛？ 你要干嘛？
Why are you doing this? What do you want?

837
01:06:48,512 --> 01:06:50,542
闭嘴！
Shut up!

838
01:06:53,589 --> 01:06:56,595
再也不说武器了 再也不说武器了
Forget the weapons! Forget the weapons!

839
01:06:56,997 --> 01:06:59,799
我要这只手，砍下来
I want the arm. Cut it off.

840
01:07:00,601 --> 01:07:03,204
他说什么？
What is he saying?

841
01:07:13,936 --> 01:07:16,137
我做给你看
I'll show you.

842
01:07:19,841 --> 01:07:22,032
我的娘呀！
Holy shit!

843
01:07:26,453 --> 01:07:29,047
告诉他们退下
You tell them to stand down!

844
01:07:34,002 --> 01:07:37,240
告诉他们安静点 后退
You tell them to be quiet! To back off!

845
01:07:39,413 --> 01:07:42,781
让他们把武器装到口袋里
Tell them to put the fokkin' weapons in the bag!

846
01:07:42,953 --> 01:07:45,684
把武器给我，他妈的混蛋
Give me the fokkin' weapons, man!

847
01:07:46,685 --> 01:07:49,288
别这样，看着我
Don't you, sir, look at me.

848
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:52,638
我说了，别盯着我看
I said don't fokkin' look at me!

849
01:07:57,547 --> 01:08:00,350
你究竟是如何长出这只手的？
How did you get that hand?

850
01:08:01,356 --> 01:08:03,220
快点
Fokkin' hurry up there!

851
01:08:03,321 --> 01:08:06,525
当我跟你说话时，你他妈看着我 你有什么秘密
Look at me when I fuckin' speak to you. What is your secret?

852
01:08:06,626 --> 01:08:09,429
你到底做了什么？告诉我
What did you do? Tell me!

853
01:08:10,304 --> 01:08:14,007
我想要他妈的那只手臂 你到底干了什么
I want that fuckin' arm. What the fuck did you do?

854
01:08:14,111 --> 01:08:16,746
你这个混蛋 我会去找你的
You fuckin' mazungo, I'm coming for you!

855
01:08:16,847 --> 01:08:19,450
我会去找你的 我会逮着你的
I'm coming for you and I'm gonna get you!

856
01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:23,330
放下刀 放下刀
Drop your fokkin' knife. Drop your fokkin' knife!

857
01:08:31,739 --> 01:08:35,342
他对我们毫无用处 你就不能放松点
He's useless to us dead. -Would you relax?

858
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:39,884
为他妈的缘故，我手下应付这种事情 至少有100遍了
For fuck's sakes, my men have done this a hundred times before.

859
01:08:40,185 --> 01:08:43,387
将猎物保持在视线范围内
<i>Maintaining a visual on the location.</i>

860
01:08:45,897 --> 01:08:47,935
一切都会很快了结的
It's gonna be quick.

861
01:08:48,035 --> 01:08:50,196
一切都会被清理地一干二净
It's gonna be clean.

862
01:08:51,241 --> 01:08:54,478
最好的，一切都会无声无息
Best of all, it's gonna be quiet.

863
01:08:55,516 --> 01:08:59,010
范德默尔还不知道会发生什么事情
Van De Merwe hasn't got a clue what's coming his way.

864
01:09:02,365 --> 01:09:05,458
没人！ 他们哪去了？
It's empty! -Where are they?

865
01:09:05,837 --> 01:09:08,565
目标消失了 此地空无一人
Target is gone. The place is empty.

866
01:09:08,666 --> 01:09:11,469
你什么意思，没人？ 那他妈到哪去了？
What do you mean, empty? Where the fuck is he?

867
01:09:11,781 --> 01:09:15,188
那个小混蛋根本不知道 接下来会发生什么
That little shithead has got no idea what is coming his way.

868
01:09:15,388 --> 01:09:17,755
我会找到他的
I'm gonna find him.

869
01:09:26,510 --> 01:09:30,516
那里有警卫，在门口 小心门口的警卫，伙计
There are the guards! At the gate! Watch the guards at the gate, man!

870
01:09:37,438 --> 01:09:39,641
快点，出去
Move! Get out!

871
01:09:45,047 --> 01:09:47,852
他们下去了 朝4楼去了
They're going down. Four stories down.

872
01:09:47,953 --> 01:09:50,956
这是外星武器 给我现状报告
This is alien weaponry. Give me a status report.

873
01:09:52,258 --> 01:09:54,660
是范德默尔 他在四楼
It's Van De Merwe. He's on level four.

874
01:09:54,765 --> 01:09:57,428
切换到实弹 我们要把他搜出来
Switch to live, and then we're taking him out.

875
01:09:57,538 --> 01:10:00,543
上校，我们不允许使用实弹
Colonel, we weren't allowed to use live ammunition.

876
01:10:00,643 --> 01:10:03,310
他们想要捉活的
They want him alive.

877
01:10:06,890 --> 01:10:09,962
留在这里，没我的允许，先别离开
Stay here until I call you. -I understand.

878
01:10:10,063 --> 01:10:12,955
我得把们打开
I need to get the door open.

879
01:10:13,757 --> 01:10:16,760
不！我说没我允许，先别离开
No! I said stay until I call you!

880
01:10:22,767 --> 01:10:24,569
操
Fuck!

881
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:28,274
我还以为你说别杀他们呢？
I thought you said not to kill them?

882
01:10:28,675 --> 01:10:31,077
他朝我开枪
He shot at me!

883
01:10:32,741 --> 01:10:35,378
操！滚出去 别他妈得看着我
Fuck! Get out! Don't fuckin' look at me!

884
01:10:35,479 --> 01:10:38,081
出去，都给我滚出去
Get out! Get the fuck out!

885
01:10:51,775 --> 01:10:54,547

搜搜那些盒子

Listen... I promise you, I didn't know they were doing this.

900
01:11:54,366 --> 01:11:57,204
直到他们上次也把我带进来
Until they brought me here the other day,

You're gonna get us killed! -What do we do now?

我以为你知道出路呢？

我从来没有提到出路

报道来自约翰内斯堡市中心的一个爆炸

别把那他妈的流体弄丢了

When we get up to the mothership, how long is this gonna take?

937
01:15:10,941 --> 01:15:13,543

-To do what? -The fixing. To fix me.

938
01:15:13,644 --> 01:15:16,447
可能要比我想的费时一些
It's going to take a bit longer than I thought.

939
01:15:16,554 --> 01:15:18,753
好的，得需要多久

940
01:15:18,854 --> 01:15:21,056
3年
Three years.

941
01:15:21,436 --> 01:15:24,008
对不起，能说清楚点吗
Sorry, just go slowly with the clicks there,

942
01:15:24,109 --> 01:15:27,449
你说的“3年”听起来想是地球上的3年
it sounded like you said "three years", like human years.

943
01:15:27,649 --> 01:15:30,287
是的，三年

但首先我得拯救我的同伴
but first I must save my people.

947
01:15:39,906 --> 01:15:43,044
我们的约定是：你能回家 我也能把病治好
The deal was: you go home, I get fixed!

948
01:15:43,145 --> 01:15:46,949
我不会让我的同胞沦为医学实验品的
I will not let my people be medical experiments!

949
01:15:47,354 --> 01:15:50,158

I'm a fokkin' medical experiment! You hear me, Christopher?

我就是他妈的一个医学实验品

我必须回家并搬些救兵过来
I must go home and get help.

952
01:15:55,767 --> 01:15:58,969
我必须用尽所有的流体 才能迅速飞回去
I must use all the fluid to travel quickly.

953
01:16:00,112 --> 01:16:04,119
那我就得呆在这个烂地方了，克里斯多夫？ 我就得呆在这个鬼地方了
I'll just stay here, Christopher? I'll just stay here in this shack.

克里斯多夫！
Christopher!

956
01:16:32,307 --> 01:16:34,710
他妈的去哪了？
Where the fuck is he?

957
01:16:35,512 --> 01:16:39,314
嘿，你把维库斯藏在下面了？
Hey, you're hiding Wikus down there, my boy?

958
01:16:40,417 --> 01:16:43,019
- 爸爸？ - 不，不要

Your daddy needs to stay here to sort out a few things, alright?

960
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:51,240

We're gonna go. We're gonna come back and fetch him, okay?

告诉我怎么弄，你这个混蛋 你是不是想让我弄死你？
Show me, you fucker. You want me to fuckin' kill you?

965
01:17:09,946 --> 01:17:12,949
这就是你想要的么，阿？
Is that what you fuckin' want, eh?

966
01:17:29,057 --> 01:17:31,659
好了...这里没有按钮

一个大虾，一颗子弹
One prawn, one bullet.

971
01:17:46,486 --> 01:17:49,585
难以置信，我拿钱就是干这事的
I can't believe I get paid to do this.

972
01:17:50,794 --> 01:17:53,829
我爱看着你们大虾死去
I love watching you prawns die.

973
01:17:56,532 --> 01:17:58,534
我操
Fuck, man!

这简直太奇异了

看起来有什么东西正从地下升起

980
01:18:41,359 --> 01:18:44,031
坐下，我没空搭理你了
Go sit down, I can't play with ya now.

981
01:18:44,131 --> 01:18:46,901
维库斯叔叔正在开飞船
Uncle Wikus is flying.

982
01:18:47,773 --> 01:18:50,342
一边去，一边去
Bug off. Bug off!

983
01:18:56,524 --> 01:18:59,326

锁定后开火

It seems to be drifting towards the center of the territory.

986
01:19:08,045 --> 01:19:10,709
我们已经锁定他了 开火
We have a lock on him. -Fire!

987

导弹已经发射出去了... 导弹打中了飞船
Something is fired upon... it has been hit!

988
01:19:15,226 --> 01:19:17,229
这是怎么回事
What the fuck is that?

989
01:19:17,329 --> 01:19:20,136
有一个引擎已经开始冒烟 飞船开始失去控制了
One of the engines is billowing smoke, it's out of control.

990
01:19:20,436 --> 01:19:24,070
它堕落下来了，头 要不要我叫些兄弟去干死他们
It's going down, boss. Should I send the boys to fuck him up?

991
01:19:27,984 --> 01:19:31,388
现在，飞船已经撞到了地上 重重一撞
Now... it hit the ground, the massive impact,

992
01:19:31,489 --> 01:19:34,492
飞船已经停下来了
and it's come to a standstill.

993
01:19:39,609 --> 01:19:42,612
我的儿子 我的儿子还在上面

闭嘴 把他带进去

快走
Move!

997
01:19:51,763 --> 01:19:55,370
我们正在向目标靠近 以拍到更清晰的飞船画面
We're banking around now, trying to get a better view of the ship

998
01:19:55,471 --> 01:19:59,275
飞船已经完全撞毁了 等着浓烟被清理掉
which is absolutely wrecked, waiting for some of the smoke to clear.

999
01:21:02,001 --> 01:21:04,808
有个人被从飞船上带了下来
Somebody has been brought out of the vehicle.

1000
01:21:04,909 --> 01:21:07,110
看起来像是个人类

72 HOURS AFTER EXPOSURE

1006

怎么回事？
What the fuck?

1007
01:22:01,617 --> 01:22:05,045
我们抓到他了，头 把他带过来

把手拿开 妈的，离我远点
Get you hands off me! Fuckin' get off me!

1013
01:23:02,244 --> 01:23:05,047
放开我
Get your fuckin' hands off me!

1014
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:45,385
我难道没有告诉过你... 我会回来找你的？
Didn't I tell you... that I'm gonna get you?

你到这里，然后你拿着 本属于我的东西走了
You came in here and you left with something that belongs to me.

I told you that the day will come.

1019
01:24:46,171 --> 01:24:49,443
你却带着我的战利品跑了
You've been running around with my prize.

1020
01:24:50,012 --> 01:24:53,651
我就想吃了你的手 变得和你一样
All I want is to eat that hand and become like you.

1021
01:24:54,087 --> 01:24:56,549
不！吃我的手不管用...
No! It won't work...

1022
01:25:00,232 --> 01:25:03,673
一旦我拥有了那种力量 就没人能够阻止我
Once I have that power, no one will stop me.

1023
01:25:03,974 --> 01:25:07,377
风水轮流转...现在到我了
It was your turn... now it's mine!

1024
01:25:10,485 --> 01:25:14,092
和MNU安全部队对着干 这些武装分子死定了
Fighting MNU security forces, this armed faction is doomed...

1025
01:25:19,039 --> 01:25:22,671
现在我要开吃了，我的朋友
Now I'm gonna eat, my friend.

1026
01:26:45,752 --> 01:26:49,955
我们刚得到消息说 外星设备已经被启动了
We're getting reports claiming that the alien device is activating...

1027
01:27:49,697 --> 01:27:53,403
你看到那个在车里的大虾了，是吗？
You see that prawn back in the Casper? -Yeah.

1028
01:27:53,670 --> 01:27:56,743
他对飞船的构造很了解
He knows what the fuck is up with that ship.

1029
01:27:56,843 --> 01:28:00,508
抓他出来，并使他开口 套出东西出来
Get that fucker out and get him talking, now.

1030
01:28:12,242 --> 01:28:16,112
三方部队正在靠近尼日利亚据点
Three contractors are closing in on the nigerian compound, and...

1031
01:28:18,451 --> 01:28:21,019
过来，外星人
Come, alien!

1032
01:28:31,479 --> 01:28:34,078
你有什么阴谋
What's your plan?

1033
01:28:57,395 --> 01:28:59,965
你们怎么弄到的？
How are you doing it?

1034
01:29:00,134 --> 01:29:02,701
谁在开那个飞船
Who's moving that ship?

1035
01:29:04,203 --> 01:29:06,605
好，这相当聪明
All right, that's very clever.

1036
01:29:11,858 --> 01:29:15,796
等我命令 确保一枪毙命
Wait for my command. Make sure you fuckin' shoot to kill.

1037
01:29:22,881 --> 01:29:25,284
操！快走！快走！
Fuck! Move it! Move it!

1038
01:29:26,886 --> 01:29:29,520
把那东西干掉
Bring that fucker down!

1039
01:29:36,242 --> 01:29:39,746
停火！停火！ 原地别动
Hold you fire! Hold your fire and keep your positions!

1040
01:29:40,045 --> 01:29:42,371
他是范德默尔
It's Van De Merwe.

1041
01:29:42,873 --> 01:29:45,075
嘿，混蛋
Hey, Dickus!

1042
01:29:59,283 --> 01:30:02,288
我回来救那外星人的 是吗？
I'll come back for prawn, alright guys?

1043
01:30:02,389 --> 01:30:04,592
听到没？ 快跑呀，维库斯
Do you hear me, now? -Run, Wikus!

1044
01:30:04,693 --> 01:30:06,934
听到我说的没？ 快跑呀
-You hear me? -Run!

1045
01:30:07,035 --> 01:30:09,837
继续跑呀 你这个胆小鬼
And keep on running, you fuckin' coward!

1046
01:30:09,939 --> 01:30:12,105
快跑，快跑
Run! Run!

1047
01:30:14,546 --> 01:30:18,385
请求空中支援 跟踪他
Get the air support up, and get on his fuckin' trail, now!

1048
01:30:21,359 --> 01:30:24,797
不起作用，头 他嘴硬得很
It's not gonna work, boss. He's a tough one.

1049
01:30:24,967 --> 01:30:28,398
他根本不透露任何消息 那直接毙了他
He's not gonna talk. -Then just fuckin' kill him.

1050
01:30:42,913 --> 01:30:45,716
他根本不透露任何消息 那直接毙了他
<i>He's not gonna talk. -Then just fuckin' kill him.</i>

1051
01:30:45,817 --> 01:30:47,419
操
Fuck!

1052
01:30:47,519 --> 01:30:50,020
他嘴很硬 不肯透露消息
<i>He's a tough one. He's not gonna talk.</i>

1053
01:30:50,121 --> 01:30:52,324
那就直接毙了他
<i>Then just fuckin' kill him.</i>

1054
01:31:15,358 --> 01:31:18,862
嘿，过来，起来 我要带你离开这
Hey, c'mon. Get up! I'm gonna get you out of here.

1055
01:31:19,023 --> 01:31:22,565
我不行了...太远了 不远，快起来
-I can't... it's too far. -It's not too fokkin' far. Get up!

1056
01:31:22,967 --> 01:31:26,369
我会带你过去 我要把你带到你儿子身边
I'm gonna get you there. I'm gonna get you to your boy!

1057
01:31:26,470 --> 01:31:28,972
来吧，跟我我身后
C'mon, stay behind me!

1058
01:31:39,883 --> 01:31:42,084
后退
Go back!

1059
01:31:45,788 --> 01:31:47,790
快跑，快跑，快跑
Run, run, run!

1060
01:31:52,694 --> 01:31:56,498
现在到达目地的了 我们得清除障碍
Arriving at the location now. We have a clearance to engage.

1061
01:31:57,099 --> 01:32:00,102
外星人过来了 趴下，趴下
Prawns are coming, get down, get down!

1062
01:32:15,716 --> 01:32:19,320
他们在朝降落点过去了 杀了这些混蛋
There are headed for a drop site. Knock these fuckers off!

1063
01:32:21,922 --> 01:32:24,124
来吧，来吧...
Come to mommy, come...

1064
01:32:27,627 --> 01:32:29,429
操
Fuck!

1065
01:32:34,935 --> 01:32:36,736
糟糕
Shit!

1066
01:32:37,947 --> 01:32:40,009
你受伤了？
Are you hurt?

1067
01:32:40,610 --> 01:32:43,413
我们可以做到 我手臂中弹了
We can make it. I was shot in the arm.

1068
01:32:43,514 --> 01:32:45,616
我们可以做到 快点
We can make it, come on!

1069
01:33:02,131 --> 01:33:05,134
听着，你直走 你可以做到的
Listen, you go ahead. You can make it.

1070
01:33:05,234 --> 01:33:09,036
我来拖住他们 我待会再和你会合
I'm gonna just... hold them off here, and I'll join you soon.

1071
01:33:09,197 --> 01:33:12,931
不，我们要并肩作战 我不会丢下你的
No, we stick together. I'm not leaving you here.

1072
01:33:13,231 --> 01:33:16,234
带着你的孩子回家 你得做到
Take your boy and go home. You have to make it.

1073
01:33:16,335 --> 01:33:19,237
别让我的辛苦白费了
Don't make me go through all of this and not make it.

1074
01:33:19,338 --> 01:33:22,610
你明白吗？ 我会回来找你的
Do you understand? -I will come back for you.

1075
01:33:22,812 --> 01:33:25,914
赶紧！在我改变主意前 快走
Go! Go now before I change my mind! Go!

1076
01:33:26,364 --> 01:33:29,126
3年，我答应过你
Three years. I promise.

1077
01:33:54,551 --> 01:33:57,354
我他妈一点都不怕你们
I'm not fuckin' scared of you!

1078
01:34:04,762 --> 01:34:07,164
朝我开枪呀
Quit fuckin' with me!

1079
01:34:53,007 --> 01:34:55,409
想抓住我？ 想抓住我？
You want me? You want me?

1080
01:35:00,313 --> 01:35:02,515
这就是你那点本事吗？
Is that all you got?

1081
01:35:03,916 --> 01:35:06,519
你他妈就那点本事吗？
Is that all you fuckin' got?

1082
01:35:08,921 --> 01:35:12,725
从主飞船上发来一束 强烈的光线
Some kind of quite extraordinary light from the mothership.

1083
01:35:12,925 --> 01:35:16,128
我从来没有见过任何类似的东西 它像一道光束
I've never seen anything like it. It's a beam of light...

1084
01:35:23,536 --> 01:35:26,338
全面扫描，好的
Full scan. Okay.

1085
01:35:29,942 --> 01:35:31,744
开火
Fire!

1086
01:36:03,173 --> 01:36:06,977
- 把那车开过来，快点 - 好的，上校   -快点快点
-Get to the vehicle, now! Get going. -Yes colonel. -Go, go, go!

1087
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:33,202
操
Fuck!

1088
01:36:34,103 --> 01:36:36,806
不敢和我玩了，Koobus！
Quit playing with me, Koobus!

1089
01:36:37,106 --> 01:36:39,308
你这个混蛋
You fucker!

1090
01:36:58,425 --> 01:37:01,028
快走，克里斯，走
Go, Chris, go.

1091
01:37:01,629 --> 01:37:03,832
回家
Go home.

1092
01:38:39,733 --> 01:38:42,536
我们现在回家了？
We go home now?

1093
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:44,627
是的
Yes.

1094
01:38:52,054 --> 01:38:55,649
暴露74小时后
74 HOURS AFTER EXPOSURE

1095
01:39:10,562 --> 01:39:12,564
简直难以置信
Unbelievable.

1096
01:39:13,364 --> 01:39:16,568
现在我知道为什么人人都 想分一杯羹了
Now I know why everybody wants a piece of you.

1097
01:39:19,671 --> 01:39:22,874
我都迫不及待想让医生 解剖你了
I can't wait for those med boys to cut you up.

1098
01:39:22,974 --> 01:39:25,176
但你知道嘛？
But you know what?

1099
01:39:25,276 --> 01:39:28,279
我不会再让你浪费我的一分一秒了
You're not gonna waste any more of my time.

1100
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:30,982
你这个半兽人
You half-breed piece of shit!

1101
01:39:32,784 --> 01:39:35,987
我要亲手宰了你
I'm gonna just fuckin' kill you myself.

1102
01:39:44,294 --> 01:39:47,698
退后，你他妈的 退后
Stay back, you fuck! Stay back!

1103
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:51,802
退后
Stay back!

1104
01:41:17,373 --> 01:41:20,447
约翰内斯堡的所有人
The people everywhere across Johannesburg

1105
01:41:20,548 --> 01:41:23,787
都冲出了办公室，涌向街头
are flooding the streets and pouring out of their offices

1106
01:41:23,890 --> 01:41:28,095
所有的眼睛都在注视着这个重大的场面
and all eyes are pointed up towards the sky on this momentous day.

1107
01:41:28,196 --> 01:41:31,800
这是20年来，飞船首次
It's the first time, ladies and gentlemen, in over two decades,

1108
01:41:31,902 --> 01:41:35,104
向大家展示移动的痕迹
that the mothership has shown any sign of movement,

1109
01:41:35,205 --> 01:41:38,007
人群极度沸腾
and people are tremendously excited.

1110
01:41:38,108 --> 01:41:41,311
整座城市都凝固了
The city had come to an absolute standstill.

1111
01:41:41,412 --> 01:41:44,816
大家都想知道接下来会发生什么
Everybody wants to know what's going to happen next.

1112
01:41:45,189 --> 01:41:48,612
究竟 克里斯多夫・约翰逊会不会回来 已经无从考证了
There's no way of knowing whether or not Christopher Johnson will return.

1113
01:41:48,712 --> 01:41:50,915
不知道他是不是逃亡了
We don't know if he was simply escaping,

1114
01:41:51,026 --> 01:41:53,617
或者他在实施一个营救计划
whether he will effect a rescue plan...

1115
01:41:55,220 --> 01:41:57,821
或者，会不会像媒体所言
...and, as the so called free press says,

1116
01:41:57,923 --> 01:42:00,926
会不会回来，向我们宣战
whether or not he will come back and declare a war on us.

1117
01:42:26,550 --> 01:42:30,453
这是维库斯・范德默尔 最后的影像记录
This is the last known footage of Wikus Van De Merwe.

1118
01:42:30,955 --> 01:42:35,557
他究竟发生了什么 我们只能猜测了
And we can only speculate as to what has happened to him.

1119
01:42:36,358 --> 01:42:39,962
一种阴谋论的理论是这样解释的
The more zany conspiracy theories state that

1120
01:42:40,162 --> 01:42:43,765
他已经被MNU或他国政府
he's been captured by MNU or by another government.

1121
01:42:43,966 --> 01:42:46,969
或者是政府特工逮捕了
Or by perhaps some shady government agency

1122
01:42:47,070 --> 01:42:49,972
已经被囚禁了起来
and he's actually being held in captivity.

1123
01:42:50,073 --> 01:42:52,975
如果我们知道他在哪里？ 我们会试图帮助他
If we knew where he was, we would try and help him,

1124
01:42:53,075 --> 01:42:56,277
而这才是难点所在，我们不知道 他身处何方
and that is the most difficult part, not knowing where he is.

1125
01:42:56,577 --> 01:43:00,781
维库斯，很不幸的是，已经离开了 把所有的问题
Wikus, sadly, is gone but I'm the one who stays behind

1126
01:43:00,882 --> 01:43:04,686
留给了我一个人 而我却无法回答
with all the questions. I can't give the answers.

1127
01:43:05,186 --> 01:43:09,190
在我心里，他早已去了 仅此而已
He died in my mind a long time ago. And that's that.

1128
01:43:09,690 --> 01:43:13,694
维库斯・范德默尔这个名字已经 是家喻户晓了
Wikus Van Der Merwe is a name that will become very widely known

1129
01:43:13,794 --> 01:43:17,798
因为他在整个事件中 扮演了关键的角色
because of this pivotal role that he played in this whole event.

1130
01:43:17,999 --> 01:43:21,602
他是一个诚实的人 他不应该承受这一切
He was an honest man, and he didn't deserve any of what happened to him.

1131
01:43:21,702 --> 01:43:25,106
我是说，我进入了一个电脑系统 并发现了一些事实
I mean, I know. I looked into a computer system and I found stuff.

1132
01:43:25,216 --> 01:43:28,508
我的意思是所有的数据 都在里面
I mean, the whole data was there, you know?

1133
01:43:28,609 --> 01:43:31,711
他们连藏都 没藏好这些数据
They didn't even do a good job of hiding it.

1134
01:43:32,112 --> 01:43:35,314
方德斯瓦・莫拉嘎正在候审
<i>Fundiswa Mhlanga is currently awaiting trial</i>

1135
01:43:35,415 --> 01:43:38,618
由于曝光了MNU的非法基因研究项目
<i>for exposing MNU's illegal genetic research program.</i>

1136
01:43:39,017 --> 01:43:41,901
在外星人重安居计划完成后
<i>District 9 was demolished</i>

1137
01:43:42,002 --> 01:43:45,205
第九区已经被拆毁了
<i>after the alien resettlement operation was completed.</i>

1138
01:43:45,324 --> 01:43:48,607
第十区现在容纳有250万外星人 而且数目仍在增长...
<i>District 10 now houses 2.5 million aliens and continues to grow...</i>

1139
01:43:49,308 --> 01:43:53,112
你们还没见过我老婆的照片吧 给你们看看吧
You guys haven't seen a picture of my wife. Let me show you my wife.

1140
01:43:53,512 --> 01:43:55,714
她是我的天使
She's my special angel.

1141
01:43:55,814 --> 01:43:58,817
穿上婚纱，她看起来简直就像是天使 你们想看看吗？
She even looks like an angel with veil, you want to see that?

1142
01:43:58,918 --> 01:44:01,720
看，白色的婚纱...
Look, you see, with the white veil over the...

1143
01:44:01,820 --> 01:44:05,624
她看起来就像是天使 所有人都说我的老婆是天使
she even looks like an angel. Everyone says that his wife is angel,

1144
01:44:05,724 --> 01:44:08,927
这就是你透过镜头看到的 真正的天使
but this is a real angel that you see there, on the cameras.

1145
01:44:09,027 --> 01:44:12,230
他们不会把这个也播出去吧 应该不会

我在门前发现了这个
I found this at my front door.

一定是某个人留下的
As tho somebody had just left it there.

01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:26,643
我的朋友们说 我应该把这个扔掉
My friends say that I should throw it away,

01:44:26,744 --> 01:44:29,147
因为它只是一片废物
cause it's just a piece of rubbish.

1150
01:44:29,646 --> 01:44:32,649

I know it's true.
