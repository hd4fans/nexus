1
00:00:46,351 --> 00:00:48,309
Flight 530 from San Francisco,

2
00:00:48,435 --> 00:00:50,892
you're cleared for landing, Captain.

3
00:00:56,768 --> 00:00:59,850
- Sorry, I don't speak Spanish.  - First time in Spain?

4
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:02,642
Yeah, first time in Spain. Where's my luggage?

5
00:01:03,727 --> 00:01:06,642
Unfortunately, it's still in San Francisco.

6
00:01:06,768 --> 00:01:08,017
Fantastic.

7
00:01:09,311 --> 00:01:10,350
Sally, it's me.

8
00:01:10,477 --> 00:01:13,225
Can you call the airline and tell them to leave my bags in San Francisco?

9
00:01:13,311 --> 00:01:16,476
I'll be back before they get here, anyway. Thanks.

10
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:26,476
Will?

11
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,517
- Hey.  - Hey.

12
00:01:45,727 --> 00:01:47,892
I was... I was expecting Josh.

13
00:01:49,269 --> 00:01:51,851
He's asleep on the boat. Jet lag.

14
00:01:53,727 --> 00:01:56,142
- Hit him all of a sudden. Good to see you.  - Good to see you.

15
00:02:00,352 --> 00:02:02,101
How's the posting?

16
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:03,851
Best in a while.

17
00:02:04,894 --> 00:02:08,017
Had a gospel quartet come through here for about six weeks,

18
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,100
and then a Picasso expert from Oregon State.

19
00:02:11,728 --> 00:02:16,059
Why on earth would Spain want to hear from a Picasso expert from Oregon?

20
00:02:16,352 --> 00:02:17,767
A different perspective.

21
00:02:17,852 --> 00:02:19,476
Sorry, hold on.

22
00:02:21,102 --> 00:02:22,309
Hello?

23
00:02:22,352 --> 00:02:25,310
Look, could I call you back in a few hours?

24
00:02:26,894 --> 00:02:28,726
- Okay, bye. Bye.  - Bye.

25
00:02:36,436 --> 00:02:37,767
One call, Dad.

26
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:43,268
This vacation, it's just a real bad time for me to be away from the company.

27
00:02:43,311 --> 00:02:46,726
Your mother's pretty happy about this vacation, Will.

28
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:52,851
Will?

29
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,435
Oh! Mmm!

30
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,351
- You look great, Mom.  -  Thanks for the groceries, hon.

31
00:03:00,478 --> 00:03:02,310
How come you're so relaxed?

32
00:03:02,352 --> 00:03:05,310
Well, that's 'cause we're all finally here.

33
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,101
How was your flight?

34
00:03:07,144 --> 00:03:10,143
The plane went up, flew straight across, went down again.

35
00:03:10,311 --> 00:03:12,268
Nothing a small bathtub of vino won't fix.

36
00:03:12,352 --> 00:03:15,517
We can do better than that. Now, why don't you get that suit off?

37
00:03:15,561 --> 00:03:18,518
It looks like an accordion on you. Where's your luggage?

38
00:03:18,561 --> 00:03:20,684
Apparently it's still saying goodbye to the Golden Gate Bridge.

39
00:03:20,728 --> 00:03:23,018
Oh! For heaven's sake. Uh...

40
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:25,559
Well, there's some clothes you left behind from last year's trip.

41
00:03:25,644 --> 00:03:26,809
Why don't you put those on?

42
00:03:26,895 --> 00:03:29,310
I'll have a nice glass of Rioja waiting for you when you're ready.

43
00:03:29,352 --> 00:03:30,684
See what I mean?

44
00:03:30,686 --> 00:03:32,726
When I got here, she was like, "Beer's in the fridge."

45
00:03:32,895 --> 00:03:34,894
Mom always liked you best.

46
00:03:35,061 --> 00:03:36,351
Oh, God.

47
00:03:38,103 --> 00:03:39,685
Look who's here.

48
00:03:40,686 --> 00:03:43,143
Dara, this is Will. The good brother.

49
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:45,684
The one who used to tell everybody he was an only child.

50
00:03:45,728 --> 00:03:47,851
Only after Josh was born.

51
00:03:58,103 --> 00:03:59,810
How was the ride with Godzilla?

52
00:04:00,728 --> 00:04:03,018
No blood, no foul. Yeah.

53
00:04:03,103 --> 00:04:05,310
Well, just take it nice and easy. It's only a week.

54
00:04:05,436 --> 00:04:07,517
I think your dad's a sweetie.

55
00:04:08,478 --> 00:04:10,684
She grew up in a Soviet orphanage.

56
00:04:13,478 --> 00:04:15,268
Well, I gotta get changed.

57
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:17,684
That's not bad.

58
00:04:17,686 --> 00:04:20,893
But it's a government job. You have to tolerate the bureaucracy.

59
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:24,060
You move when the government tells you to move, so not everybody likes it.

60
00:04:24,103 --> 00:04:25,518
Yeah, I'm not sure I liked it.

61
00:04:25,603 --> 00:04:29,057
Josh and I never got to have the same friends for more than two years in a row.

62
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:32,143
Not to mention we lived in 12 different countries over 18 years.

63
00:04:32,603 --> 00:04:35,101
But the best thing is we learned about 15 weird local sports.

64
00:04:35,103 --> 00:04:36,435
Excuse me, my man.

65
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:39,934
We both played basketball and ran track in the Comoros, remember?

66
00:04:40,103 --> 00:04:42,310
Although no one in the school was over 5'3",

67
00:04:42,353 --> 00:04:45,102
and Will was pretty much the all-star everywhere we went.

68
00:04:47,145 --> 00:04:48,685
Wow! Well done.

69
00:04:49,853 --> 00:04:51,059
Mmm. Got it?

70
00:04:51,312 --> 00:04:53,685
Before we start, I just want to say how happy I am

71
00:04:53,686 --> 00:04:55,685
that we're all finally together around a table again.

72
00:04:56,312 --> 00:04:58,269
I didn't realize how much I'd missed this.

73
00:04:58,312 --> 00:04:59,852
To family. Nice.

74
00:04:59,895 --> 00:05:01,101
To family.

75
00:05:03,895 --> 00:05:05,310
This looks fantastic.

76
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:07,102
My caveman caught it this morning.

77
00:05:07,228 --> 00:05:08,894
You fish, Mr. Shaw?

78
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,435
Yeah, he fishes.

79
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,102
-  Oh, guys.  - He fishes. He fishes.

80
00:05:13,228 --> 00:05:16,060
- No, guys, seriously, please.  - Come on! I want to hear this story.

81
00:05:17,228 --> 00:05:19,227
-  Spear-fishing, actually, is his forte.  - Excuse me.

82
00:05:19,312 --> 00:05:20,518
I got to take this. Important.

83
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,478
No more of those stories or I'll start telling some of yours.

84
00:05:23,603 --> 00:05:26,268
Where are you sleeping tonight? You guys aren't sleeping together, are you?

85
00:05:26,312 --> 00:05:27,351
Jesus, Dad.

86
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:34,102
If we work together on this, I'm sure it's going to be beneficial for both of us.

87
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:38,227
This Thursday?

88
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,518
I'm out of the country, so...

89
00:05:48,811 --> 00:05:50,810
I understand.

90
00:05:52,437 --> 00:05:54,102
Okay. Bye.

91
00:06:03,103 --> 00:06:05,852
-  Quite dangerous.  - Yeah, in his case it was quite dangerous.

92
00:06:05,895 --> 00:06:08,143
- Here he comes. Shh!  - Poor Will.

93
00:06:08,312 --> 00:06:09,852
- Poor Will.  - It's just his little secret.

94
00:06:09,895 --> 00:06:11,685
That story's going to stay in the family for a while.

95
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:12,728
It's not going anywhere.

96
00:06:12,853 --> 00:06:14,893
Please, tell me. Come on.

97
00:06:15,895 --> 00:06:17,101
Josh, that's enough.

98
00:06:17,145 --> 00:06:20,102
- No, guys, seriously, please. Don't.  - Will is the fisherman.

99
00:06:20,145 --> 00:06:23,226
All right, before they go off on any kind of fantastic story,

100
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:25,436
what really happened was that he took me out

101
00:06:25,437 --> 00:06:29,227
when I'm 10 years old spear-fishing, ten years old,

102
00:06:30,103 --> 00:06:32,268
and I spear my own flipper.

103
00:06:32,687 --> 00:06:34,311
And everyone finds this hilarious.

104
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:36,518
- That's the story?  - That's the story.

105
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,478
He cried all night.

106
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,894
He could've speared his foot.  He cried himself to sleep.

107
00:06:40,937 --> 00:06:43,895
Will would make this noise when he cried. Josh could tell you.

108
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:46,644
- It's like a little wuffling sound.  - Really funny. Really...

109
00:06:46,687 --> 00:06:49,019
Actually, you know what? This is not the day for a joke.

110
00:06:54,687 --> 00:06:57,603
- I don't know if I can stay the week.  - What?

111
00:07:01,437 --> 00:07:02,685
I'm sorry, Mom.

112
00:07:02,812 --> 00:07:07,060
I have just found out

113
00:07:07,103 --> 00:07:08,852
my company is officially bankrupt.

114
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:17,310
What?

115
00:07:19,104 --> 00:07:21,436
-  I'm sorry.  - What are you talking about?

116
00:07:23,021 --> 00:07:24,102
Will?

117
00:08:02,353 --> 00:08:04,935
I'm sorry I went off at you at dinner.

118
00:08:09,104 --> 00:08:12,519
I'm sorry you're going through such a difficult time.

119
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:21,102
Thank you.

120
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:31,269
It'll be a good wind tomorrow.

121
00:08:33,021 --> 00:08:34,102
Yeah.

122
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,394
Get ready to come about!

123
00:08:53,812 --> 00:08:55,102
Will?

124
00:08:55,729 --> 00:08:56,894
Will!

125
00:09:06,104 --> 00:09:07,895
Tighter on that boom!

126
00:09:08,896 --> 00:09:10,394
Tighter, Will!

127
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,686
I heard you the first time.

128
00:09:27,271 --> 00:09:29,103
Josh, we'll anchor here!

129
00:09:46,146 --> 00:09:47,269
Will?

130
00:09:48,812 --> 00:09:49,894
Will!

131
00:09:52,396 --> 00:09:54,270
When you get a minute.

132
00:09:59,646 --> 00:10:01,479
Keep it into the wind.

133
00:10:48,104 --> 00:10:50,061
Will! Into the wind!

134
00:10:50,938 --> 00:10:52,854
Head it into the wind!

135
00:10:56,605 --> 00:10:57,686
Dara!

136
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:01,644
Oh, my God, are you okay?

137
00:11:01,688 --> 00:11:03,145
- Let me take a look.  - Yeah, I'm okay.

138
00:11:03,188 --> 00:11:05,103
- Oh, my God!  - I'm okay. I'm okay.

139
00:11:05,188 --> 00:11:07,103
Is she okay? You all right?

140
00:11:07,188 --> 00:11:09,478
-  You'll be fine.  - Yeah, I'm fine.

141
00:11:11,688 --> 00:11:14,103
- Damn phone!  - Hey! Are you kidding me?

142
00:11:14,105 --> 00:11:15,937
- Will, have you lost your mind?  - No!

143
00:11:16,022 --> 00:11:17,812
- Shut up!  - That's my career you threw away there!

144
00:11:17,897 --> 00:11:20,187
- There is a girl on the deck of the boat...  - What the hell?

145
00:11:20,271 --> 00:11:22,311
...with her head cut open!  Martin! Enough!

146
00:11:22,438 --> 00:11:24,270
I'm okay! Seriously.

147
00:11:33,396 --> 00:11:36,270
I'm going into town. Anybody need anything?

148
00:11:37,022 --> 00:11:40,729
Try to find some antiseptic. The pharmacy should have some.

149
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,479
Okay, I'm gonna need some cash.

150
00:11:45,396 --> 00:11:46,936
Hurry back, Will.

151
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,729
Gracias.

152
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,270
I love you.

153
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,936
- I got it. Be careful.  - Okay.

154
00:14:08,063 --> 00:14:10,479
Hey. Did you see where that boat went?

155
00:14:25,063 --> 00:14:29,604
Guys, any of you see a boat? Like, a sailboat? No?

156
00:15:16,856 --> 00:15:17,855
Mom?

157
00:15:55,023 --> 00:15:57,480
Please, you gotta help me. Something's happened to my family.

158
00:15:58,772 --> 00:15:59,854
What?

159
00:16:00,689 --> 00:16:02,854
Hey! Something's happened to my family!

160
00:16:02,898 --> 00:16:05,021
My boat's been ripped to shit and they're gone!

161
00:16:09,064 --> 00:16:11,688
- I'm Captain Pizarro. You are?  - I'm Will Shaw.

162
00:16:15,606 --> 00:16:17,396
Where are you going?

163
00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:29,688
Take me to the boat.

164
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:54,897
- Who the hell is that?  - Please, Mr. Shaw, relax.

165
00:16:56,607 --> 00:16:59,063
Will. Can I call you Will?

166
00:17:00,398 --> 00:17:01,688
How do you know my name?

167
00:17:02,273 --> 00:17:03,855
Your mother told me.

168
00:17:04,981 --> 00:17:06,605
- Where is she?  - I can take you to her.

169
00:17:06,648 --> 00:17:09,063
And the rest of your family. Come on.

170
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,605
No, hey!

171
00:17:17,315 --> 00:17:20,272
- Hey! Come on!  - No, no! Hey!

172
00:17:20,398 --> 00:17:22,272
- Come on.  - Hey, let me go! Get off me!

173
00:17:56,899 --> 00:17:58,022
Shit!

174
00:18:54,607 --> 00:18:58,813
Will? Will? Let's go. Come on. Get up.

175
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,272
Are you okay, Will?

176
00:19:13,565 --> 00:19:16,439
Head hurts. I just got the shit kicked out of me.

177
00:19:19,857 --> 00:19:21,897
Where's Mom? Where's Josh?

178
00:19:23,648 --> 00:19:25,105
I'm not sure where they are.

179
00:19:25,191 --> 00:19:26,772
What?

180
00:19:26,857 --> 00:19:29,481
I asked you, "Where's Mom? Where's Josh?" I left them with you.

181
00:19:29,607 --> 00:19:31,481
Men came on the boat.

182
00:19:32,648 --> 00:19:36,481
They put a gun to my head, and they took your mother and Josh and Dara.

183
00:19:36,648 --> 00:19:38,855
- What the hell is happening?  - I'm sorry.

184
00:19:39,024 --> 00:19:41,564
- Why are you sorry? What?  - I'm sorry.

185
00:19:43,024 --> 00:19:48,647
Will, I don't book gospel quartets and Picasso experts.

186
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:52,647
It's not the job I do at the Embassy.

187
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:56,564
The only thing that's true is that I've worked for the government a long time.

188
00:19:56,648 --> 00:19:58,439
So what do you do?

189
00:19:58,483 --> 00:20:01,231
It's a branch of the Agency.

190
00:20:03,441 --> 00:20:05,647
It's a special branch of the Agency.

191
00:20:08,316 --> 00:20:10,856
- And Mom and Josh are gone.  - Not like you think.

192
00:20:11,065 --> 00:20:13,481
- Just don't treat me like an idiot.  - I'm not.

193
00:20:13,566 --> 00:20:15,398
- You are! Mom and Josh are gone.  - I'm not treating...

194
00:20:15,441 --> 00:20:18,064
You're CIA and you don't know where they are?

195
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:21,272
I'm sorry.

196
00:20:24,899 --> 00:20:26,856
Is it something you did?

197
00:20:27,191 --> 00:20:28,689
It may be, yes.

198
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,482
I'm sorry, Will.

199
00:20:36,608 --> 00:20:39,231
There's no way I could ever explain that to you.

200
00:20:41,316 --> 00:20:44,772
But we're gonna get your mother back and Josh back and Dara back.

201
00:20:44,857 --> 00:20:46,772
Try and get some rest.

202
00:20:54,274 --> 00:20:55,898
- Hey.  - Marty, is that you?

203
00:20:56,024 --> 00:20:58,063
- Yeah, it's me.  - What's going on?

204
00:20:58,441 --> 00:21:00,398
- I'm on my way now.  - What's happening?

205
00:21:00,441 --> 00:21:03,023
- Where are you?  - I'm at home. It's 3:00 in the morning.

206
00:21:03,065 --> 00:21:04,981
I need to see you.

207
00:21:50,649 --> 00:21:52,023
Yeah. Let's go. Come on.

208
00:21:59,566 --> 00:22:01,315
I need you to drive.

209
00:22:04,483 --> 00:22:07,981
Diego, I'm gonna meet Carrack. I need your help.

210
00:22:08,483 --> 00:22:10,273
I'll call you later.

211
00:23:01,608 --> 00:23:03,064
Does Mom know?

212
00:23:06,066 --> 00:23:09,440
Yeah, she knows. She knows everything.

213
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:14,064
- She's my wife.  - How could you not tell me this?

214
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:16,815
There was no way to tell you. No way, Will.

215
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:24,565
It would have never been right to tell you what I do.

216
00:23:30,983 --> 00:23:32,231
Who's that?

217
00:23:36,233 --> 00:23:37,482
A friend.

218
00:23:39,358 --> 00:23:40,857
Just sit tight.

219
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,690
You gonna be all right?

220
00:23:51,066 --> 00:23:52,773
You're a great son.

221
00:23:59,649 --> 00:24:01,440
Be back in a second.

222
00:24:26,484 --> 00:24:28,690
- Are you okay?  - No.

223
00:24:29,066 --> 00:24:31,231
What's going on? Are you hurt?

224
00:24:31,567 --> 00:24:34,274
What did you do? You set me up?

225
00:24:34,692 --> 00:24:37,399
- Did I set you up?  - Did you set me up?

226
00:24:37,775 --> 00:24:42,107
- Marty, what are you talking about?  - They took Laurie and Josh off the boat.

227
00:24:42,192 --> 00:24:43,565
Who did?

228
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,190
I can't help you if you don't talk to me, Marty.

229
00:24:48,066 --> 00:24:50,231
Who took Laurie? Who did?

230
00:24:50,275 --> 00:24:53,815
The guys we took the briefcase from. They want it back.

231
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:56,273
- Shit.  - Who are they, Jean?

232
00:24:56,609 --> 00:24:59,191
They gave me 24 hours, or they're going to kill them.

233
00:25:02,983 --> 00:25:04,273
Where's the briefcase?

234
00:25:08,609 --> 00:25:12,441
The briefcase went straight up the line. It's gone.

235
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:15,398
Carrack, don't fuck with me right now.

236
00:25:17,692 --> 00:25:19,441
- No?  - I'll try.

237
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:20,982
- No, that's it?  - I'll try.

238
00:25:21,025 --> 00:25:24,024
- Okay, then I'm gonna go.  - Marty, I want to help you.

239
00:25:24,025 --> 00:25:26,648
It went straight up the line. I don't have it anymore.

240
00:25:30,358 --> 00:25:31,899
You need to fix this.

241
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,857
I'll do my best, Marty.

242
00:26:22,276 --> 00:26:23,357
Dad?

243
00:26:31,193 --> 00:26:32,192
God.

244
00:26:37,358 --> 00:26:38,482
God.

245
00:27:17,859 --> 00:27:19,608
Deal with the body.

246
00:27:48,859 --> 00:27:51,191
- Hello?  - What's the status?

247
00:27:51,234 --> 00:27:54,441
- Someone's trying to kill me.  - Put Tom on the phone.

248
00:27:54,485 --> 00:27:57,649
- Someone shot my father.  - Tell Tom he has less than 21 hours.

249
00:27:57,775 --> 00:27:59,566
Who's Tom? Who the hell are you?

250
00:27:59,651 --> 00:28:01,275
The guy who has your family.

251
00:28:01,401 --> 00:28:02,774
Where do you have...

252
00:28:10,193 --> 00:28:13,025
Hey! Hey, hey! No!

253
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:16,774
There's a guy who's trying to kill me!

254
00:28:16,817 --> 00:28:19,441
Hold on, this guy's going to kill me! There's a guy trying to kill me!

255
00:28:23,443 --> 00:28:25,025
Damn it!

256
00:28:33,443 --> 00:28:34,774
Okay, I...

257
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,025
I'm American!

258
00:31:10,027 --> 00:31:11,609
Can you help me?

259
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:15,816
There's no evidence of a Martin Shaw with any of our agencies in Spain.

260
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:18,734
He told us he was a cultural attache.

261
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,275
I thought you said that he wasn't.

262
00:31:22,818 --> 00:31:25,858
My father is dead. Executed. Assassinated.

263
00:31:25,985 --> 00:31:28,358
Mr. Shaw, there's a local warrant for your arrest.

264
00:31:28,444 --> 00:31:31,609
- It claims you killed a police officer.  - Wait, hold it, hold it. No. No.

265
00:31:31,652 --> 00:31:36,234
Look, the guy who shot my father was shooting at me halfway across the city.

266
00:31:36,277 --> 00:31:38,817
We can assist you in securing legal counsel

267
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,358
and protecting your rights as an American citizen.

268
00:31:40,444 --> 00:31:42,151
Look, I did not kill that cop.

269
00:31:42,652 --> 00:31:44,610
But you know what? We don't have time for this.

270
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:48,651
My family doesn't have the time. Will you please help me? Please?

271
00:31:48,818 --> 00:31:51,858
I suggest you accept our help getting you legal counsel.

272
00:31:51,985 --> 00:31:54,442
- Is there someone else I can talk to?  - Just calm down.

273
00:31:54,486 --> 00:31:56,401
All anyone ever says to me is calm down.

274
00:31:56,444 --> 00:31:57,859
Tranquilo, tranquilo.

275
00:31:57,943 --> 00:31:59,609
My family has been kidnapped,

276
00:31:59,652 --> 00:32:02,067
and I am wanted for a murder I did not commit.

277
00:32:10,943 --> 00:32:12,025
Yes?

278
00:32:13,486 --> 00:32:14,817
Yes, ma'am.

279
00:32:17,611 --> 00:32:19,401
Right now, in fact.

280
00:32:23,235 --> 00:32:25,400
Someone needs to talk to you.

281
00:32:35,027 --> 00:32:36,859
Come with us, Mr. Shaw.

282
00:32:41,402 --> 00:32:43,234
Will? It's Jean.

283
00:32:44,611 --> 00:32:47,984
Jean Carrack. I worked with your father.

284
00:32:53,402 --> 00:32:57,151
You know, I bet if you raise your left hand, I will see a big white scar

285
00:32:57,235 --> 00:32:59,442
running right across your palm.

286
00:32:59,527 --> 00:33:01,817
You got that making me a martini when you were 10.

287
00:33:01,944 --> 00:33:03,443
- Don't you remember?  - Hey, yeah. I remember you.

288
00:33:05,611 --> 00:33:08,817
Look, your father has left your family in a tough spot.

289
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:10,151
I'd like to help.

290
00:33:10,235 --> 00:33:11,817
Why don't you get in the car and we'll figure this out?

291
00:33:11,861 --> 00:33:13,026
Okay, if you didn't kill him, who did?

292
00:33:14,736 --> 00:33:16,443
I was there to help him.

293
00:33:16,444 --> 00:33:20,026
I was trying to protect him, but he wouldn't listen to me.

294
00:33:20,069 --> 00:33:21,735
He was not a great listener, your father.

295
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,234
I'll tell you everything I know when you get in the car.

296
00:33:31,736 --> 00:33:34,234
Will. Come on.

297
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:40,026
Do you want to save your family? Because there's an expiration date on that.

298
00:33:43,569 --> 00:33:45,067
Come on, Will.

299
00:34:08,736 --> 00:34:11,735
So who was your father dealing with about your family?

300
00:34:11,819 --> 00:34:13,610
Who was his contact?

301
00:34:15,236 --> 00:34:17,401
I thought you said you were gonna do the talking.

302
00:34:17,819 --> 00:34:21,234
If I'm going to help you, I have to figure out who I'm dealing with.

303
00:34:21,861 --> 00:34:24,610
Did he call anyone? Did he meet anyone?

304
00:34:25,736 --> 00:34:28,610
- Are you all right?  - I think I'm gonna be sick.

305
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,817
- Really?  - Really.

306
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:32,151
Pull over.

307
00:34:45,195 --> 00:34:46,359
Better?

308
00:34:51,361 --> 00:34:53,568
All right, kid, come on. Let's go.

309
00:34:53,611 --> 00:34:55,067
Senor!

310
00:34:55,819 --> 00:34:57,359
You little...

311
00:34:59,069 --> 00:35:00,443
Forget him.

312
00:35:01,944 --> 00:35:05,234
Come on, let's go. We'll just get the other one first.

313
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:14,735
Hey! Get away from there! Get away from there!

314
00:35:57,236 --> 00:35:58,235
What?

315
00:36:00,028 --> 00:36:02,359
Don't do this to me. Seriously.

316
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,194
Please. I'm...

317
00:36:08,028 --> 00:36:09,027
Thank you.

318
00:36:52,737 --> 00:36:53,776
Yes?

319
00:36:55,862 --> 00:36:58,194
Hello? Are you... Hello?

320
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:02,194
Tell your son I want to speak to Tom.

321
00:37:02,403 --> 00:37:04,319
-  Will?  - Mom!

322
00:37:04,403 --> 00:37:05,610
Mom, are you okay?

323
00:37:05,612 --> 00:37:09,027
Put your father on the phone. I need to speak to him now.

324
00:37:09,029 --> 00:37:11,110
Mom,

325
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:12,402
you can't.

326
00:37:12,445 --> 00:37:14,818
Just put him on the phone.

327
00:37:14,862 --> 00:37:16,194
Mom, I can't put him on the phone.

328
00:37:16,196 --> 00:37:18,402
Will, just do as I say.

329
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,027
Mom, I can't.

330
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,194
Where is he?

331
00:37:24,403 --> 00:37:26,402
Mom, they've killed him.

332
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:30,028
No! No!

333
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:39,444
Hey! Hey! Calm down.

334
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:43,527
Tom and I had an agreement. My briefcase or your family's dead.

335
00:37:43,612 --> 00:37:49,110
Listen, I don't know anything about your suitcase or briefcase or anything.

336
00:37:49,112 --> 00:37:50,360
Just let my family go.

337
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,402
- This is not going to buy any more time.  - What?

338
00:37:53,445 --> 00:37:55,402
Remind Tom what is at stake.

339
00:37:55,445 --> 00:38:00,110
Look, my dad is dead and his name was Martin.

340
00:38:00,196 --> 00:38:01,527
You've got the wrong guy.

341
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:05,818
Tell Tom. 6:00 PM. Puerta del Sol.

342
00:38:05,862 --> 00:38:08,527
My briefcase or your family's dead.

343
00:38:39,112 --> 00:38:40,944
Hello. Do you speak any English?

344
00:38:41,029 --> 00:38:43,777
A little bit. How can I help you?

345
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:46,736
My name is Will Shaw. I'm just looking for Diego.

346
00:38:46,778 --> 00:38:48,235
He was a friend of my father's.

347
00:38:48,321 --> 00:38:50,320
Can you give me your address, please?

348
00:38:50,404 --> 00:38:51,777
Yes.

349
00:38:53,571 --> 00:38:55,111
Cruz Street.

350
00:38:55,196 --> 00:38:57,527
34, Suite 502, Madrid.

351
00:39:26,821 --> 00:39:27,820
Hi.

352
00:39:30,987 --> 00:39:32,611
Hi, how are you?

353
00:39:32,738 --> 00:39:34,195
What can I do for you?

354
00:39:34,237 --> 00:39:36,195
- We spoke on the phone.  - Mmm-hmm.

355
00:39:36,321 --> 00:39:37,360
You gave me the directions here.

356
00:39:37,404 --> 00:39:38,611
Mmm-hmm.

357
00:39:39,029 --> 00:39:39,986
Can I help you?

358
00:39:44,154 --> 00:39:45,819
I need to speak to Diego Caldera.

359
00:39:45,945 --> 00:39:47,985
Hey, Will. You feeling better now?

360
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,987
Whoa! Whoa!

361
00:40:24,196 --> 00:40:26,235
Put the gun down! Put the gun down! Put the gun down!

362
00:40:26,362 --> 00:40:29,195
I only speak goddamn English!

363
00:40:29,237 --> 00:40:30,360
You want to kill my uncle!

364
00:40:31,988 --> 00:40:33,028
Who the hell is your uncle?

365
00:40:33,404 --> 00:40:35,195
Is Diego Caldera your uncle?

366
00:40:36,196 --> 00:40:39,360
Yeah. This cabron comes in here with a gun

367
00:40:39,613 --> 00:40:41,944
and tells me to sit down and shut up, waiting for my uncle to come in.

368
00:40:41,988 --> 00:40:44,320
This guy's friends murdered my father this morning.

369
00:40:44,988 --> 00:40:46,111
Your father was murdered?

370
00:40:46,196 --> 00:40:47,360
That's why I'm here.

371
00:40:47,863 --> 00:40:51,570
My dad called this office at least a dozen times looking for Diego.

372
00:40:51,821 --> 00:40:53,403
- Where is your uncle then?  - What?

373
00:40:53,446 --> 00:40:55,403
Look, okay? This guy,

374
00:40:55,779 --> 00:40:57,612
his people came looking here for your uncle.

375
00:40:58,613 --> 00:40:59,819
Where are they going to look next?

376
00:41:02,197 --> 00:41:03,945
Do you really want to be here when his pals turn up?

377
00:41:05,613 --> 00:41:08,361
Come on. We gotta find your uncle.

378
00:41:41,571 --> 00:41:43,777
- It's open.  - Okay, okay, I've got it.

379
00:42:43,738 --> 00:42:46,320
This kid is all over the damn news.

380
00:42:46,405 --> 00:42:48,820
Why didn't you take care of him this morning?

381
00:42:48,905 --> 00:42:51,028
Come on, Dixon, answer your phone.

382
00:42:51,113 --> 00:42:52,612
Don't do it!

383
00:42:53,363 --> 00:42:56,570
Hi, Will. Surprise.

384
00:43:04,197 --> 00:43:06,196
Put the gun down, Will.

385
00:43:06,197 --> 00:43:07,236
You're scared,

386
00:43:07,363 --> 00:43:10,403
and scared people holding guns in my face, that scares me.

387
00:43:10,614 --> 00:43:12,695
Well, this is going to be a nerve-wracking conversation.

388
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,613
May I sit down?

389
00:43:17,197 --> 00:43:18,612
So,

390
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,696
what can I do for you?

391
00:43:22,655 --> 00:43:23,945
Why did you kill him?

392
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:26,112
If our situations were reversed,

393
00:43:26,197 --> 00:43:28,154
believe me, your father would've done the exact same thing.

394
00:43:28,614 --> 00:43:30,613
Why did you kill him?

395
00:43:30,655 --> 00:43:33,446
Your father wanted to give something back to our enemies

396
00:43:33,572 --> 00:43:35,987
that's a matter of national security.

397
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,987
You mean the briefcase?

398
00:43:41,614 --> 00:43:44,196
He was about to betray his country, Will.

399
00:43:44,238 --> 00:43:45,945
And betray us, his team.

400
00:43:46,405 --> 00:43:47,612
I don't believe you.

401
00:43:47,822 --> 00:43:49,821
- Really?  - Honestly, kid,

402
00:43:50,238 --> 00:43:51,403
we don't give a shit.

403
00:43:51,989 --> 00:43:54,404
Maybe I knew him better than you did.

404
00:43:56,363 --> 00:43:57,403
I want to see my family.

405
00:43:57,572 --> 00:43:58,612
I don't have your family.

406
00:43:58,780 --> 00:43:59,779
Who does?

407
00:43:59,989 --> 00:44:02,404
I'm sorry to say that some terrorists do.

408
00:44:02,572 --> 00:44:06,362
Will, you are the last person I want to get more involved in this right now.

409
00:44:06,405 --> 00:44:07,404
But I need your help.

410
00:44:08,614 --> 00:44:11,945
I need you to tell me who else he saw or spoke to about this.

411
00:44:12,197 --> 00:44:13,445
You give me what I need,

412
00:44:13,947 --> 00:44:16,571
I will pull out all the stops to help you get your family back.

413
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:20,778
You need to tell them that my father's dead and that I've got nothing to do with this.

414
00:44:21,114 --> 00:44:22,779
I just want to save my family!

415
00:44:23,405 --> 00:44:24,778
Right.

416
00:44:27,156 --> 00:44:29,696
So, I certainly think we owe you something.

417
00:44:29,739 --> 00:44:30,738
Wait, wait, wait. Sit down!

418
00:44:35,405 --> 00:44:37,528
Go! Come on!

419
00:44:38,614 --> 00:44:40,112
Go, go!

420
00:44:41,239 --> 00:44:42,446
Come on!

421
00:44:56,114 --> 00:44:57,113
God damn it!

422
00:45:00,405 --> 00:45:01,404
Get out of the way!

423
00:45:02,156 --> 00:45:03,155
Go! Go! Go!

424
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:26,613
We gotta find a way down!

425
00:45:28,198 --> 00:45:29,404
There's no way down!

426
00:45:34,323 --> 00:45:35,404
God!

427
00:45:46,822 --> 00:45:49,571
- What are you doing?  - Get your arms up.

428
00:45:49,614 --> 00:45:52,987
- Okay, hold that under your arm.  - No, no. Wait! Are you kidding me?

429
00:45:53,031 --> 00:45:55,154
- Trust me. This is the only way down.  - No, no, no. No way!

430
00:45:55,198 --> 00:45:56,404
This is the only way you're going to be safe.

431
00:45:56,406 --> 00:45:57,405
No! Are you crazy?

432
00:46:03,947 --> 00:46:05,404
- Lucia!  - No! No way!

433
00:46:05,531 --> 00:46:06,821
Stand still and listen to me!

434
00:46:10,573 --> 00:46:11,821
Are you ready for this?

435
00:46:17,448 --> 00:46:19,405
Will! Don't drop me!

436
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:36,739
Oh, God!

437
00:46:41,031 --> 00:46:42,030
Stop!

438
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:43,821
Will! Come on!

439
00:47:48,364 --> 00:47:50,779
Come on!

440
00:48:20,199 --> 00:48:22,614
I've been shot.

441
00:48:23,781 --> 00:48:25,113
She's here!

442
00:48:36,282 --> 00:48:37,239
Will!

443
00:48:41,948 --> 00:48:43,780
No!

444
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:53,280
Lucky.

445
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:57,113
It's fine. It's fine.  No hospital.

446
00:48:57,199 --> 00:48:58,947
- It's fine.  - No hospital.

447
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:01,822
It's not a hospital. My friend can help you here.

448
00:49:02,157 --> 00:49:05,197
You gotta take me to Puerta del Sol. It's fine.

449
00:49:07,032 --> 00:49:08,989
Are you okay?

450
00:49:15,781 --> 00:49:16,780
What is this place?

451
00:49:18,531 --> 00:49:19,779
Chris, please!

452
00:49:19,907 --> 00:49:20,906
Lucia! What happened?

453
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:22,822
You gotta take me to Puerta del Sol. I need to find my family.

454
00:49:22,907 --> 00:49:24,280
They killed my uncle!

455
00:49:24,491 --> 00:49:26,947
This guy's wounded! You have to help me!

456
00:49:27,532 --> 00:49:30,406
No, take him away. You'll get me into trouble!

457
00:49:31,698 --> 00:49:33,489
You go to medical school, help him!

458
00:49:33,781 --> 00:49:35,530
I'm a student, not a doctor.

459
00:49:35,698 --> 00:49:36,946
Hey!

460
00:49:37,032 --> 00:49:38,780
Cristiana! What's going on?

461
00:49:39,948 --> 00:49:41,405
Habib, call Maximo, we need help!

462
00:49:42,574 --> 00:49:44,822
He's losing lots of blood! I don't have anywhere to take him.

463
00:49:54,365 --> 00:49:57,614
- When was he shot?  - An hour ago, I think.

464
00:50:02,781 --> 00:50:04,322
Keep him awake.

465
00:50:07,699 --> 00:50:09,698
Talk to me! Please, talk to me!

466
00:50:11,365 --> 00:50:12,489
Where are they?

467
00:50:12,574 --> 00:50:13,531
In the office.

468
00:50:13,907 --> 00:50:15,405
Does she think this is a hospital?

469
00:50:15,616 --> 00:50:17,031
I owe her uncle some favors

470
00:50:17,115 --> 00:50:19,780
but she can't bring a bleeding guy into my club!

471
00:50:19,907 --> 00:50:21,739
I don't have time for this shit!

472
00:50:23,324 --> 00:50:24,989
What's going on, girls?

473
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:29,697
Maximo, please.

474
00:50:30,574 --> 00:50:32,281
Maximo, Diego has been killed.

475
00:50:32,491 --> 00:50:33,989
This guy saved my life!

476
00:50:34,491 --> 00:50:35,947
His father's been killed too.

477
00:50:36,532 --> 00:50:39,531
Maximo, hand me that vodka. I need to sterilize my hands.

478
00:50:40,782 --> 00:50:42,364
Lucia, tell him this is going to hurt a lot.

479
00:50:42,491 --> 00:50:43,739
I need to see if there's a bullet.

480
00:50:43,824 --> 00:50:45,698
- What's she saying?  - She says not to worry.

481
00:50:45,741 --> 00:50:47,198
You're gonna be fine.

482
00:50:53,782 --> 00:50:56,906
Perfect! There's no bullet. Now I have to stop the bleeding.

483
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:59,572
There is no bullet. There is no bullet.

484
00:50:59,699 --> 00:51:01,822
Please, please, please. Okay.

485
00:51:01,908 --> 00:51:04,364
You need a drink, my friend? I do.

486
00:51:05,574 --> 00:51:07,114
Guys, hold him tight!

487
00:51:07,365 --> 00:51:10,572
- What's she doing? What's she doing?  - Okay, she's gonna stop the bleeding.

488
00:51:18,991 --> 00:51:21,364
Well done. Well done, my friend.

489
00:51:24,157 --> 00:51:26,947
Oh! I'm going to puke.

490
00:51:53,499 --> 00:51:54,789
Why did they kill my uncle?

491
00:51:56,541 --> 00:51:57,498
I don't know.

492
00:51:57,958 --> 00:52:00,540
Probably because my father reached out to him.

493
00:52:00,583 --> 00:52:02,373
I don't know. I'm sorry.

494
00:52:04,083 --> 00:52:06,915
Why do you have a photo of Tom Keaton on your phone?

495
00:52:08,499 --> 00:52:11,123
That's my father. That's Martin Shaw.

496
00:52:12,791 --> 00:52:13,914
He's your father?

497
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:16,539
Yes.

498
00:52:20,541 --> 00:52:22,373
- Is he dead? Are you sure he's dead?  - Yes.

499
00:52:22,499 --> 00:52:24,164
Yes, I told you.

500
00:52:31,166 --> 00:52:33,957
Did you know my father? Were you friends?

501
00:52:44,083 --> 00:52:46,290
Friends before anything else.

502
00:52:47,541 --> 00:52:48,956
All my life.

503
00:52:55,333 --> 00:52:59,207
Oh, God. I can't stay here. I've gotta find my family.

504
00:52:59,333 --> 00:53:00,707
Where do you need to go?

505
00:53:00,749 --> 00:53:02,331
To Puerta del Sol.

506
00:53:03,749 --> 00:53:05,290
So you called your father Martin?

507
00:53:05,333 --> 00:53:08,582
I didn't call him that. That was his name.

508
00:53:15,666 --> 00:53:17,873
Do you even know what he did?

509
00:53:19,749 --> 00:53:21,373
What do you mean?

510
00:53:21,458 --> 00:53:23,457
What he did for a living.

511
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,790
He said he was a business consultant.

512
00:53:29,958 --> 00:53:32,540
Business consultant. That's rich.

513
00:53:41,542 --> 00:53:44,332
What about you? What do you do?

514
00:53:45,749 --> 00:53:48,331
I used to run a small company.

515
00:53:51,292 --> 00:53:53,540
And what did your small company do?

516
00:53:58,166 --> 00:53:59,957
Business consultants.

517
00:54:01,208 --> 00:54:03,082
Like father, like son.

518
00:54:06,166 --> 00:54:09,165
So you seem to know my father pretty well. How come?

519
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:11,498
Were you sleeping with him?

520
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:16,749
That's what you think?

521
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:23,249
I wasn't your...

522
00:54:23,333 --> 00:54:24,707
I don't know what I'm supposed to think.

523
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:26,541
I wasn't your father's lover.

524
00:54:29,709 --> 00:54:31,249
My mother was.

525
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:33,915
He was my father, too.

526
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:59,915
Did you know about his other family?

527
00:55:09,667 --> 00:55:11,457
He was hardly around.

528
00:55:14,876 --> 00:55:16,708
Sometimes I think the more a parent's absent,

529
00:55:19,084 --> 00:55:21,000
the more you love them.

530
00:55:29,584 --> 00:55:32,249
Next stop, Puerta del Sol.

531
00:55:48,251 --> 00:55:50,083
So, you, too?

532
00:55:50,167 --> 00:55:51,875
I was fine with it.

533
00:55:53,251 --> 00:55:54,791
Sure you were.

534
00:56:00,959 --> 00:56:02,999
And your mother?

535
00:56:03,084 --> 00:56:04,749
What's she like?

536
00:56:06,458 --> 00:56:08,249
My mother is dead.

537
00:56:11,542 --> 00:56:12,915
I'm sorry.

538
00:56:20,584 --> 00:56:22,583
Will! Wait!

539
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:23,915
Wait.

540
00:56:29,126 --> 00:56:32,125
- Okay.  - I told you. I need to go alone.

541
00:56:32,251 --> 00:56:34,916
If you need me, I'll be at the club.

542
00:56:36,334 --> 00:56:37,666
That's all.

543
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:39,082
Thank you.

544
00:56:39,126 --> 00:56:41,583
I hope you will get them back.

545
00:57:31,126 --> 00:57:33,749
Keep your hands where I can see them.

546
00:57:36,293 --> 00:57:38,499
Turn around and walk with me.

547
00:57:39,084 --> 00:57:40,374
Where?

548
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:43,124
Follow me.

549
00:58:39,376 --> 00:58:41,166
Where is your father?

550
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,667
Where's my family?

551
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:10,833
I've told you,

552
00:59:10,918 --> 00:59:12,542
over and over.

553
00:59:13,543 --> 00:59:15,583
My father is dead.

554
00:59:16,251 --> 00:59:17,332
If you don't believe me,

555
00:59:17,376 --> 00:59:21,292
then have your guy here really go to town on me.

556
00:59:21,334 --> 00:59:22,749
Sure he'll feel better.

557
00:59:23,127 --> 00:59:25,917
And I still won't know a goddamned thing.

558
00:59:27,127 --> 00:59:29,709
Even if that's true, it's still your problem.

559
00:59:36,543 --> 00:59:39,083
Do you know how we come to this, Will?

560
00:59:40,334 --> 00:59:44,041
Two months ago, one of my men posed as a corrupt agent

561
00:59:44,127 --> 00:59:47,333
willing to sell sensitive pieces of intel to terrorists.

562
00:59:53,543 --> 00:59:56,500
The mission was to uncover a rogue CIA operative

563
00:59:56,543 --> 01:00:00,250
we knew was making deals for his own interest.

564
01:00:00,335 --> 01:00:02,584
So my agent arranged a rendezvous.

565
01:00:02,918 --> 01:00:04,500
And guess who showed up?

566
01:00:11,085 --> 01:00:12,333
Your father killed my agent

567
01:00:12,751 --> 01:00:16,542
and stole a briefcase that held contents vital to my country.

568
01:00:17,252 --> 01:00:19,333
And now you tell me he's dead?

569
01:00:19,377 --> 01:00:20,709
Agent?

570
01:00:22,127 --> 01:00:23,126
How about terrorist?

571
01:00:25,043 --> 01:00:26,333
Terrorist?

572
01:00:28,585 --> 01:00:32,916
My wife and son met a terrorist once, in a cafe in Tel Aviv.

573
01:00:33,751 --> 01:00:35,791
In an instant,

574
01:00:35,835 --> 01:00:37,542
they and 15 others

575
01:00:37,918 --> 01:00:39,458
were turned to ash.

576
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:49,959
So the question becomes

577
01:00:51,252 --> 01:00:53,375
who killed your father?

578
01:01:00,335 --> 01:01:02,584
People from his own agency.

579
01:01:04,294 --> 01:01:06,667
They killed his friend and they've been trying to kill me, too.

580
01:01:06,751 --> 01:01:08,333
You mean Carrack?

581
01:01:08,669 --> 01:01:09,834
Yeah.

582
01:01:12,751 --> 01:01:16,750
You guys should really get together and chat about this.

583
01:01:16,835 --> 01:01:18,875
I think you'd get on really...

584
01:01:21,544 --> 01:01:24,334
Perhaps she wants to eliminate you as a witness,

585
01:01:24,377 --> 01:01:26,084
along with the rest of your family.

586
01:01:26,877 --> 01:01:30,041
Bottom line is that, wherever you go,

587
01:01:30,127 --> 01:01:32,250
they'll be hunting you.

588
01:01:33,544 --> 01:01:36,126
And that will suit our purposes fine.

589
01:01:46,711 --> 01:01:48,126
- Will!  - Will!

590
01:01:48,252 --> 01:01:49,251
- You're alive!  -  Guys!

591
01:01:49,335 --> 01:01:50,709
- Has anyone hurt you?  -  Will, you're okay!

592
01:01:50,752 --> 01:01:52,917
The irony is,

593
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:56,458
if your father's killers are trying to eliminate witnesses,

594
01:01:56,502 --> 01:02:00,459
the only thing keeping your family alive right now is their captivity.

595
01:02:02,544 --> 01:02:03,917
So here is the deal.

596
01:02:04,085 --> 01:02:06,584
I need you out there to draw her to you.

597
01:02:06,669 --> 01:02:08,959
We know that some potential buyers are in town.

598
01:02:09,502 --> 01:02:11,501
So we feel that the sale is imminent.

599
01:02:12,711 --> 01:02:14,126
If she really wants to kill you all,

600
01:02:14,919 --> 01:02:17,668
I just need to stay close to you.

601
01:02:17,711 --> 01:02:21,959
But just so we're clear, if I don't stop Carrack before it's sold,

602
01:02:23,669 --> 01:02:26,167
I won't keep your family any longer.

603
01:02:26,335 --> 01:02:29,126
I'll release them, and Carrack will kill them.

604
01:02:32,669 --> 01:02:34,042
Understood?

605
01:02:36,377 --> 01:02:37,376
Guys!

606
01:02:37,502 --> 01:02:38,917
Will! Wait!

607
01:03:33,919 --> 01:03:35,501
Just get off of me!

608
01:03:35,544 --> 01:03:38,293
Hey! Get your hands off me! Get off me!

609
01:03:39,128 --> 01:03:40,501
Let me go!

610
01:03:41,295 --> 01:03:42,543
Hey, man.

611
01:03:48,586 --> 01:03:49,959
I need to see Lucia.

612
01:03:50,086 --> 01:03:51,835
Come. I'll take you.

613
01:04:14,752 --> 01:04:16,293
Will.

614
01:04:16,336 --> 01:04:18,668
I've seen them. They're alive.

615
01:04:20,503 --> 01:04:21,918
I need to get her coming after me.

616
01:04:21,961 --> 01:04:24,668
It shouldn't be hard, 'cause she's trying to track me down anyway.

617
01:04:24,711 --> 01:04:26,917
She wants to kill anyone who knew anything about it.

618
01:04:27,836 --> 01:04:30,293
And the Israeli said that the likely buyers are in town tonight.

619
01:04:30,711 --> 01:04:34,293
So we gotta move, 'cause the deal could happen any time.

620
01:04:35,503 --> 01:04:36,543
Hey.

621
01:04:37,503 --> 01:04:38,877
- For you.  - Thank you.

622
01:04:39,711 --> 01:04:41,376
How much did you hear?

623
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:45,626
Along with what Lucia told me before? Enough.

624
01:04:45,711 --> 01:04:47,834
This bitch, Carrack,

625
01:04:50,253 --> 01:04:51,501
she's the one who killed Diego, right?

626
01:04:52,503 --> 01:04:54,043
So, how can I help?

627
01:04:56,628 --> 01:04:58,960
They're spies, right? Eyes everywhere?

628
01:04:59,378 --> 01:05:00,877
Phones, e-mail. Everything.

629
01:05:01,712 --> 01:05:04,127
Let's start a tab. Then they'll find us.

630
01:05:04,128 --> 01:05:07,127
Lucia, wait a second. Are you sure you're ready for this?

631
01:05:08,336 --> 01:05:09,960
Say my name and you can say it with honor

632
01:05:25,336 --> 01:05:26,710
She's not working tonight.

633
01:05:26,712 --> 01:05:27,960
Gracias.

634
01:06:20,045 --> 01:06:21,878
You don't understand me, but when you were in school,

635
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,627
you ever hear the story of Brer Rabbit? Huh?

636
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:49,335
- Is it sold?  - Is it sold?

637
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:51,419
Jesus Christ! You're dumber than your father.

638
01:06:51,503 --> 01:06:53,419
What are you actually asking me, Will?

639
01:06:54,336 --> 01:06:58,168
"Is it sold?" What's sold? The briefcase? Or is your family dead?

640
01:06:58,254 --> 01:07:01,086
'Cause if it's sold, they're dead. Right?

641
01:07:05,296 --> 01:07:07,295
The deal's gonna happen.

642
01:07:08,087 --> 01:07:11,919
And the only way you'll know where is if you make me tell you.

643
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:13,710
But I ain't telling you shit.

644
01:07:13,837 --> 01:07:14,918
No!

645
01:07:20,045 --> 01:07:21,460
Get him up!

646
01:07:21,962 --> 01:07:23,961
- Untie him! - He'll kill you, man.

647
01:07:28,879 --> 01:07:29,836
Will!

648
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,711
Get off me! We'll do this!

649
01:07:32,461 --> 01:07:34,543
- Get off me! Get off me!  - We'll do this!

650
01:07:36,296 --> 01:07:38,502
Where's Carrack? Answer me!

651
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:42,252
Tell me! Where is she? Why isn't she here?

652
01:07:42,296 --> 01:07:44,836
- Why isn't she here?  - Because!

653
01:07:46,129 --> 01:07:47,544
She's a lady.

654
01:07:47,962 --> 01:07:51,252
And ladies, unlike your little sister,

655
01:07:51,296 --> 01:07:53,128
stay at home while the men go out...

656
01:07:56,837 --> 01:07:59,168
Kick the shit out of him!

657
01:07:59,628 --> 01:08:02,252
Don't worry. He'll talk.  Just tape him up. We've done enough.

658
01:08:02,296 --> 01:08:04,502
I know that it's not easy to watch, but it will work.

659
01:08:04,546 --> 01:08:05,919
- No, it won't.  - It will.

660
01:08:05,962 --> 01:08:08,127
- I've got a plan.  - The duct tape won't hold.

661
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:12,044
We have to let him go. We need a car.

662
01:08:13,628 --> 01:08:16,544
- I don't understand.  - Promise me you won't go in there.

663
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:18,085
I still don't understand.

664
01:08:18,129 --> 01:08:21,294
He thinks I'm an idiot. Let me deliver on that.

665
01:08:29,129 --> 01:08:32,168
Dad was no traitor. Carrack played him.

666
01:08:33,504 --> 01:08:34,878
Played him and the Israelis.

667
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:38,127
- And the Israelis are out there?  - They better be.

668
01:09:01,129 --> 01:09:02,836
There.

669
01:09:36,337 --> 01:09:37,295
They are on the move.

670
01:09:37,421 --> 01:09:39,211
Stay close to them. Call me if she shows up.

671
01:09:39,296 --> 01:09:40,295
Ok.

672
01:10:04,838 --> 01:10:06,336
He got away.

673
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:09,087
I'll deal with him later.

674
01:10:09,130 --> 01:10:12,087
Let's hope for your sake he doesn't show up.

675
01:10:43,921 --> 01:10:45,753
There. Pull over.

676
01:10:49,629 --> 01:10:50,752
Be careful.

677
01:11:19,088 --> 01:11:21,087
- Stay here, okay?  - Okay. What are you gonna do?

678
01:11:21,088 --> 01:11:22,628
Wait for them.

679
01:11:28,504 --> 01:11:31,711
I'm glad to see you brought what I was expecting.

680
01:11:42,921 --> 01:11:47,003
Yeah, I ran into a little bit of trouble, but it's been dealt with.

681
01:11:52,297 --> 01:11:55,212
Shh! Come with me.

682
01:11:57,297 --> 01:11:59,670
- We're on your side.  - Okay.

683
01:12:03,838 --> 01:12:06,628
So, gentlemen, if you're ready, we can do our business.

684
01:12:06,921 --> 01:12:09,044
How can I be sure this is the real thing?

685
01:12:09,088 --> 01:12:11,545
It came directly from a Mossad agent.

686
01:12:11,921 --> 01:12:13,837
Sadly, no eyewitnesses.

687
01:12:14,672 --> 01:12:17,753
You're not gonna find anything else like this one.

688
01:12:19,505 --> 01:12:20,545
Shh!

689
01:12:20,672 --> 01:12:22,004
Crawl back out of here.

690
01:12:22,921 --> 01:12:24,003
We'll take over now.

691
01:12:25,088 --> 01:12:27,211
No. Tell me where my family is or I'm not going anywhere.

692
01:12:27,921 --> 01:12:30,753
Listen to me. Leave now or I'll have to drag you out.

693
01:12:30,838 --> 01:12:32,295
- No!  - Leave now!

694
01:12:42,463 --> 01:12:43,628
Catch.

695
01:14:06,422 --> 01:14:08,254
Lucia! Calm down.

696
01:14:12,714 --> 01:14:14,671
It's okay. It's okay.

697
01:14:15,297 --> 01:14:16,712
You, Will?

698
01:14:23,214 --> 01:14:24,921
Of all the people

699
01:14:26,672 --> 01:14:28,671
who should've killed me.

700
01:14:42,214 --> 01:14:43,880
Will! She's coming.

701
01:14:46,463 --> 01:14:48,503
No! No! No!

702
01:15:45,506 --> 01:15:47,713
You amateur!

703
01:16:03,214 --> 01:16:05,880
Hurry up. Hurry up. Go, go, go!

704
01:16:15,464 --> 01:16:16,671
Watch it!

705
01:17:27,673 --> 01:17:28,672
Whoo!

706
01:17:39,673 --> 01:17:40,880
- Come on!  - Please! No!

707
01:18:11,299 --> 01:18:12,463
Jesus!

708
01:18:24,090 --> 01:18:26,922
No, no, no! No!

709
01:18:28,215 --> 01:18:29,672
God! Damn!

710
01:18:37,590 --> 01:18:39,046
Where are they? Who?

711
01:18:39,090 --> 01:18:40,422
The Israelis. Where are they?

712
01:18:45,424 --> 01:18:46,589
Shit!

713
01:19:01,299 --> 01:19:02,630
Where is she? Where is she?

714
01:19:04,007 --> 01:19:05,422
She's there!

715
01:19:15,923 --> 01:19:17,714
No, no, no! Wait, wait! Don't!

716
01:19:22,132 --> 01:19:23,881
Come on!

717
01:19:37,674 --> 01:19:39,673
Who's going to pay for my car now?

718
01:19:51,507 --> 01:19:53,797
- Lucia! Get out. Come on, come on!  - What?

719
01:20:12,048 --> 01:20:13,088
All right! That's it!

720
01:20:16,007 --> 01:20:19,046
I'm getting sick of this. Come on.

721
01:20:20,090 --> 01:20:21,922
She's coming! She's coming!

722
01:20:22,923 --> 01:20:24,046
Come on!

723
01:20:27,048 --> 01:20:28,297
God damn!

724
01:21:06,674 --> 01:21:08,256
Carrack, you bitch!

725
01:22:31,028 --> 01:22:32,902
Oh, Will.

726
01:22:35,944 --> 01:22:37,401
What a mess.

727
01:22:39,569 --> 01:22:42,026
Looks like you're gonna need some more stitches.

728
01:22:42,861 --> 01:22:45,234
And your little dead friend, too.

729
01:22:45,861 --> 01:22:48,026
Your mother's gonna freak out.

730
01:22:49,195 --> 01:22:52,652
Aw! Is that your father's gun?

731
01:22:54,861 --> 01:22:56,234
I'm sorry.

732
01:23:00,445 --> 01:23:02,152
You looking for something like this?

733
01:23:22,153 --> 01:23:23,234
Will!

734
01:24:00,654 --> 01:24:02,943
My sister. She's hurt back there.

735
01:24:03,236 --> 01:24:06,194
Relax. She's halfway to the hospital.

736
01:24:11,445 --> 01:24:14,652
Your father, for all the hell he caused us,

737
01:24:16,862 --> 01:24:18,778
would be proud of you.

738
01:24:22,362 --> 01:24:24,235
What about my family?

739
01:24:39,654 --> 01:24:43,818
Oh, my God!

740
01:25:19,029 --> 01:25:22,152
You handled yourself pretty well out there for a kid who knows shit.

741
01:25:22,403 --> 01:25:24,277
I have to tell you, I was impressed.

742
01:25:26,612 --> 01:25:29,569
Thanks for helping us clean up our own mess.

743
01:25:30,945 --> 01:25:32,444
Does this mean I can go home now?

744
01:25:32,570 --> 01:25:34,027
Sure. Whatever.

745
01:25:34,237 --> 01:25:36,694
But I think you should really consider another line of work.

746
01:25:38,279 --> 01:25:41,861
You know, your father was an honest man.

747
01:25:42,654 --> 01:25:44,444
I'm sorry he's gone.

748
01:25:46,279 --> 01:25:47,653
Thank you.

749
01:25:48,403 --> 01:25:50,361
Could I ask you something?

750
01:25:51,029 --> 01:25:52,235
Shoot.

751
01:25:53,445 --> 01:25:55,444
What the hell was in the briefcase?

752
01:25:55,654 --> 01:25:57,277
There's only one way I can answer that.

753
01:26:03,446 --> 01:26:05,445
I've gotta go see my family.

754
01:26:15,779 --> 01:26:16,736
Hey.

755
01:26:18,029 --> 01:26:19,361
Thank you.

756
01:26:27,446 --> 01:26:29,611
You told her about me, right?

757
01:26:31,654 --> 01:26:34,027
It didn't really seem important.

758
01:26:34,945 --> 01:26:36,736
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

759
01:26:42,779 --> 01:26:45,235
You should go and introduce yourself.

760
01:26:45,279 --> 01:26:47,028
She is your sister.

761
01:26:48,654 --> 01:26:50,277
She is my sister.
