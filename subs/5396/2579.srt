00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:31,167
有个男人在我家
There's a man in my house.

3
00:01:31,584 --> 00:01:35,337
家里还有个宝宝,他要杀我们
I have a baby. He's going to kill us.

4
00:01:36,505 --> 00:01:39,925
女士,谁在你家?女士,别挂电话
Who's in the house, ma'am? Ma'am, stay with me.

5
00:01:41,427 --> 00:01:42,428
求求你,快一点
Please, hurry!

6
00:01:48,392 --> 00:01:50,770
天啊,他要进来了
God, he's coming!

7
00:01:51,854 --> 00:01:52,855
他要进来了
He's coming.

8
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:57,443
鲍威尔街有一位母亲和她的宝宝有被杀害的危险
Possible homicide in progress. Mother and infant.

9
00:01:57,526 --> 00:02:00,446
在附近的小组请赶往处理.女士,请不要挂掉电话
Dispatch all vehicles in the area. Ma'am, stay with me.

10
00:02:00,529 --> 00:02:02,323
不!不…
No! No!

11
00:02:17,296 --> 00:02:19,590
你为什么要这样对待我？
Why are you doing this?

12
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:22,676
你是个坏母亲
You're a bad mother.

13
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:41,737
摇啊摇,摇到树梢
"Rock-a-bye baby, in the treetop

14
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:47,701
待风起,摇篮摇啊摇
"When the wind blows, the cradle will rock

15
00:02:48,953 --> 00:02:53,916
树枝一折断,摇篮即落地
"When the bough breaks the cradle will fall

16
00:02:55,251 --> 00:03:00,756
宝贝、摇篮和所有一切都将归于尘土
"And down will come baby

17
00:03:00,923 --> 00:03:03,296
"Cradle and all"

18
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,263
孩子,让我结束这场恶梦吧
Let me finish your nightmare, kid.

19
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,190
你们情况如何？SWAT来了吗？
What's your status? Is SWAT here yet?

20
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:20,818
把这个地方看好
Secure your perimeter.

21
00:03:29,368 --> 00:03:31,495
你们还在等什么？ 等SWAT小组
-What are you waiting for? -SWAT team.

22
00:03:31,704 --> 00:03:33,914
他们会待上整晚的,看着楼梯
They'll be all night. Take the stairs.

23
00:03:58,856 --> 00:04:00,858
电梯这里发现有烟
We've got smoke in here.

24
00:04:03,986 --> 00:04:05,321
是他
It's him.

25
00:04:11,869 --> 00:04:13,954
导演：林岭东

26
00:04:22,588 --> 00:04:23,589
上
Go!

27
00:04:26,008 --> 00:04:27,259
拜托,不要开枪
Don't shoot, please!

28
00:04:27,426 --> 00:04:29,303
有看到陌生人吗 没有
-Is anybody else in there? -No!

29
00:04:29,762 --> 00:04:31,680
克里斯,快下楼看看
Get them downstairs! Go!

30
00:04:31,806 --> 00:04:33,933
去,快点 去看看
-Get them out! -Check it!

31
00:04:36,894 --> 00:04:40,815
杰克,我们该等消防队来 当然,混蛋
-We've got to wait for the fire trucks. -Absolutely. Shit!

32
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,948
去把窗户打开,快去
Get those windows open. Go on!

33
00:04:49,365 --> 00:04:50,616
快,动作快点
Come on! Move it!

34
00:05:29,905 --> 00:05:30,906
孩子,来吧
Come on, baby!

35
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,141
走!
Go!

36
00:06:01,312 --> 00:06:03,147
孩子,来吧
Come on, baby.

37
00:06:04,106 --> 00:06:05,649
我没事,快离开这里
I'm okay. Get out of here!

38
00:06:33,677 --> 00:06:34,845
等一下,你在干什么
What in hell are you doing?

39
00:06:40,392 --> 00:06:41,560
没事了
It's okay.

40
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:03,332
快把孩子送去医院,确定是否没事
Take the baby. Get him to the hospital. Make sure he's okay.

41
00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:06,460
嫌犯是男性白种人,正由豪瑟街往北走去
Suspect is a white male, heading north on Hauser on foot...

42
00:07:06,544 --> 00:07:08,671
穿黑色毛外套
...wearing a black leather coat.

43
00:07:32,361 --> 00:07:33,863
停车
Hold it there!

44
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:38,325
巴士快停车,把门打开
Stop the bus! Open up!

45
00:07:40,077 --> 00:07:41,996
怎么了？ 各位,对不起
-What's going on? -Sorry, folks.

46
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,417
只是例行检查而已,没什么大不了
Just a routine check. Nothing to be alarmed about.

47
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:53,674
发生什么事了？
What's going on?

48
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,802
抱歉,打扰各位了
Sorry for the inconvenience.

49
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:07,730
大家都站起来,面向窗户,别看我
Everybody up! Against the window. Don't look at me!

50
00:08:31,962 --> 00:08:32,963
不要动
Freeze!

51
00:09:24,557 --> 00:09:25,808
杰克,害怕了吧
Be afraid, Jake.

52
00:09:27,268 --> 00:09:29,103
很害怕吧
Be very afraid.

53
00:10:55,898 --> 00:10:57,775
我差点就抓到他了,真的
Almost had him. I had him!

54
00:10:58,025 --> 00:11:00,069
是啊,现在他不是你的问题了
Well, that's not your problem anymore.

55
00:11:00,486 --> 00:11:03,030
你在一个小时前就退休了
As of an hour ago, you're officially retired.

56
00:11:03,531 --> 00:11:04,782
我知道
I know.

57
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:07,743
一旦找到车子,查血迹会查个水落石出
When they find the car they should check for blood.

58
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:10,496
闭嘴好吗,这不再是你的案子了
Shut up, okay. lt's not your case anymore.

59
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:12,790
我曾办过这个案子,我很关心能否破案
I popped him one. Check for blood.

60
00:11:12,957 --> 00:11:15,251
你就是不肯罢手,对吧？
You just couldn't leave quietly, huh?

61
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:19,547
霍尔,我不需要你来帮我发表光荣的退休演说
You know, I wanted one last inspiring lecture from you.

62
00:11:19,964 --> 00:11:21,465
十年来你全听他们的
Ten years, you've heard them all.

63
00:11:21,549 --> 00:11:25,719
你还是对我那么凶.但在你离开前,联邦政府人员在现场,他们想跟你谈谈
A lot of good it's done. But, before you go, the feds are here. They want to talk.

64
00:11:25,803 --> 00:11:28,472
跟我谈？ 他们当然想谈罗
To me? Of course, they do.

65
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,435
你好
Gentlemen.

66
00:11:34,145 --> 00:11:37,898
杰克,我是唐莱兹曼.你好吗？ 我很好,你们想干嘛？
-Stan Reisman. How are you? -Fine. What do you want?

67
00:11:38,315 --> 00:11:41,652
我知道你要退休了 没错
-I understand you're leaving the force. -That's right.

68
00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:46,574
我们想提供你一份工作 不,谢了,我不需要
-We'd like to offer you a job. -No, thanks. Don't need one.

69
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:50,828
我们能帮你抓到他.他会再度行凶的
We can help you catch him. He will kill again.

70
00:11:58,878 --> 00:12:01,881
昨晚有第十一名受害者遇害
Last night, the Torch claimed his 11th victim.

71
00:12:01,964 --> 00:12:04,592
这位恐怖的连续杀人犯
This elusive serial killer has remained at large...

72
00:12:04,675 --> 00:12:06,969
已经横行三年
...for over three years, preying on mothers...

73
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:08,596
专门威胁西雅图地区的母亲
...throughout the Seattle area.

74
00:12:09,263 --> 00:12:13,267
杰克莱利警探曾经侦办过本案,应该挺身出来说明本案
Detective Jake Riley who has headed up the case had this to say about the Torch.

75
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,811
为什么凶手要折磨受害者？
How's it to be leaving with the Torch case unsolved?

76
00:12:15,895 --> 00:12:16,896
我不予置评
No comment.

77
00:12:17,021 --> 00:12:18,439
杰克,他打电话给你了吗？ 不予置评
-Has he called you? -No comment.

78
00:12:18,522 --> 00:12:20,983
你是因为这位聪明的杀人犯而退休？
Is this brilliant killer the reason you're quitting?

79
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:24,361
我因个人因素申请退休 本案无可奉告
I'm retiring for personal reasons. It's got nothing to do with it.

80
00:12:24,445 --> 00:12:27,281
杰克,少来了 好吧,我告诉你们一件事
-Come on. Give us something. -I'll give you something.

81
00:12:27,364 --> 00:12:32,995
事实证明,喜欢杀人的大混蛋只是一个讨厌妈妈的小鬼
Our big bad bogeyman is nothing more than a bed-wetting mama's boy.

82
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:35,573
没错,他就是这样的人
That's right. He pisses himself all the time.

83
00:12:35,623 --> 00:12:40,044
他是个变态的精神病患者.这样够了吧
Pathetic really. Just a sick pervert. Is that enough for you?

84
00:12:40,586 --> 00:12:42,588
你们都录下来了吗？ 录下来了吗？
-Did you get that? -Did we get that?

85
00:12:43,005 --> 00:12:44,256
你们都录下来了吗？
Did you get that?

86
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,886
亲爱的杰克,你的电话 谢谢您
-Darling, telephone for you. -Oh, thanks, Mom.

87
00:13:31,512 --> 00:13:32,513
喂
Yeah?

88
00:13:33,973 --> 00:13:37,184
杰克,你昨晚在电视上提到我的事可不是玩笑话
That was a nasty thing you said about me on TV.

89
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:39,770
是吗？你太敏感了
Oh, yeah? You're just a little too sensitive.

90
00:13:39,854 --> 00:13:42,314
你给听我着,别再打电话给我,我已经退休了
I don't want you calling me anymore. I'm retired.

91
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,609
你可以退休,但你永远抓不到我
You can quit, but you'll never get rid of me.

92
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:47,278
我太聪明了
I'm too smart.

93
00:13:47,403 --> 00:13:49,530
是啊,你妈会以你这个疯子为荣
Yeah, Mommy must be proud of her little psycho.

94
00:13:49,947 --> 00:13:52,074
杰克,别说了,看看你自己
Stop it. Look at yourself.

95
00:13:52,783 --> 00:13:57,913
你花了三年时间想抓我却徒劳无功,你是个坏警察
Three years trying to catch me. But you failed. You're a bad cop.

96
00:13:58,289 --> 00:14:00,583
你以为你退休就能阻止我吗？
Do you think quitting would stop me?

97
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,794
我会继续杀人的
I'm going to keep on killing, asshole.

98
00:14:04,295 --> 00:14:07,715
你是个真正的失败者 去你的,你这个婊子养的混蛋
-You're a real loser. -Fuck you, you fucking prick!

99
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,301
我会像疯狗一样去追捕你
I'm gonna track you down like a fucking dog!

100
00:14:10,384 --> 00:14:12,178
你心知肚明,你这婊子养的
You understand, you son of a bitch?

101
00:14:12,261 --> 00:14:13,095
去你的
Fuck you!

102
00:14:13,179 --> 00:14:14,972
杰克,我也去你的
Fuck you, too, Jake.

103
00:14:19,852 --> 00:14:22,605
受害者的背景几乎都一样
It's always the same M.O. with slight variations.

104
00:14:22,772 --> 00:14:25,858
全是单亲母亲,都是被烧死的
Single mother. Mole. Burns them postmortem.

105
00:14:26,942 --> 00:14:31,405
我们采集到部份指纹,甚至凶手的轮廓跟血型
We've got partial prints. Trace evidence. Blood type, even.

106
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:34,742
-But still no Torch. 但还是毫无头绪 -No shit. 不会吧
-But still no Torch. -No shit.

107
00:14:35,534 --> 00:14:37,912
说点我不知道的吧
Tell me something I don't know.

108
00:14:51,634 --> 00:14:53,761
我们将杀人凶手的资料
We fed enormous amounts of data on the Torch...

109
00:14:53,886 --> 00:14:57,723
输入到超级电脑里,发现凶手是白种男性
...into our ViCAP supercomputer. We've come up with a white male.

110
00:14:57,848 --> 00:14:59,850
三十多岁,非常健壮
Thirties. Very physical.

111
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:12,905
站在屏幕前
Step up to the mark.

112
00:15:26,252 --> 00:15:28,003
杰克莱利,欢迎您
Welcome, Jacob Riley.

113
00:15:54,905 --> 00:15:56,782
一年前的玛特西凶杀案里
The Martucci slayings, a year ago.

114
00:15:57,074 --> 00:16:01,287
我们找到一根他的毛发,用来复制DNA足足有余
We found a hair follicle belonging to him. It was enough for a DNA imprint.

115
00:16:04,206 --> 00:16:06,333
拉近看看
Take a closer look.

116
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:19,096
好吧,这是凶手复制人 一点都没错
-Okay. So this is a clone of the killer? -A replicant.

117
00:16:19,263 --> 00:16:22,141
上帝花了六天创造出人类,我们则花更长时间做出复制人
God created man in six days. We took longer.

118
00:16:22,475 --> 00:16:25,519
FBI从什么时候开始… 我们不是FBI
-Since when is the FBl- -We're not FBl.

119
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,314
我们是国安局的人
We're National Security Force.

120
00:16:31,734 --> 00:16:34,111
我们不在乎什么连续杀人犯
We really don't care about your serial killer.

121
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:38,824
基本上此事牵涉到国家安全,恐怖份子才是我们的目标
Originally, this was developed for national security. Counter-terrorism.

122
00:16:40,951 --> 00:16:43,954
当今情报系统无法找出这些恐怖份子
Today's intelligence has failed to weed out terrorists.

123
00:16:44,205 --> 00:16:45,664
好吧,我懂了
Okay. Go on.

124
00:16:45,748 --> 00:16:49,001
我们要创造复制人,帮我们找到元凶
Our goal is to create replicants that can lead us to them.

125
00:16:49,126 --> 00:16:50,461
我懂了
I understand.

126
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:53,589
但他不是恐怖份子
He's not a terrorist, though.

127
00:16:53,672 --> 00:16:56,592
对,但行为模式很相似
No. But the behaviour patterns are similar.

128
00:16:57,968 --> 00:16:59,929
那么,为什么找我？
So, why me?

129
00:17:00,721 --> 00:17:02,181
因为他挑上了你
Because he picked you.

130
00:17:02,515 --> 00:17:04,391
你说他挑上了我是什么意思？
What do you mean he picked me?

131
00:17:04,517 --> 00:17:07,645
当他准备好后会交给你看管,你负责照顾他
When he's ready you'll take custody. You'll care for him.

132
00:17:07,978 --> 00:17:11,565
帮助开发他的潜能,再看看能否帮你找到凶手
Help him develop. Then you'll see if he can lead you to the killer.

133
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:14,527
让他的照片上电视来解决此事不是更容易？
Wouldn't it be easier just to plaster his face on TV?

134
00:17:15,236 --> 00:17:20,908
不,这是机密计划,没有照片,不能使用传统办案技巧
This project is classified. No pictures. No conventional techniques.

135
00:17:21,367 --> 00:17:24,245
你唯一的工具便是复制人
All you have is Replicant.

136
00:17:44,723 --> 00:17:45,808
发生了什么事？
What's going on?

137
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:49,687
心脏出现逆反应,排斥荷尔蒙成长
A counter-reaction. He's rejecting the latest growth hormone.

138
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:58,988
快跟我说,有什么解决办法？ 不跳动了
-Talk to me. What can we do? -V-fib! Flatline!

139
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:02,992
把他放出来,快!
Get him out. Now!

140
00:18:30,186 --> 00:18:32,146
欢迎光临我的世界
Welcome to my world.

141
00:18:32,521 --> 00:18:33,689
混蛋
Motherfucker.

142
00:18:47,286 --> 00:18:49,246
一号复制人,早上好
Good morning, Number One.

143
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,333
该起床了
Time to wake up.

144
00:18:55,211 --> 00:18:58,714
我们今天要上基本课程,学习如何坐...
Today, we're going to cover the basics: How to sit...

145
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:02,510
立、走、停
...stand, walk and stop.

146
00:19:03,969 --> 00:19:06,263
我现在在走路
Now I'm walking.

147
00:19:09,266 --> 00:19:10,351
我坐了下来
I'm sitting.

148
00:19:12,937 --> 00:19:14,480
我站起来
I'm standing.

149
00:19:16,941 --> 00:19:19,610
我是强纳森女士,您好
I'm Miss Johnson. How are you?

150
00:19:23,197 --> 00:19:24,740
跌伤了吗？
Did you hurt yourself?

151
00:19:26,409 --> 00:19:28,327
你的小金童可能没有那么聪明
Maybe your golden boy's retarded.

152
00:19:28,411 --> 00:19:31,997
物理读数正常,但脑波很低
Physical readings are normal, but the brain sign waves are low.

153
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:37,336
我们已透过基因重新排序加强他的精神感应能力
We've enhanced his telepathic ability through genome resequencing.

154
00:19:38,754 --> 00:19:42,800
他可能是我们第一个用基因工程做出来的复制人
He may be our first, but genetic memory has been scientifically proven.

155
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,927
他只是需要人类的刺激
He just needs human stimuli.

156
00:19:46,554 --> 00:19:48,097
那是厕所
That's the toilet.

157
00:19:48,264 --> 00:19:51,934
那就是你来此的目的,和他展开人类的第一次接接触
That's where you come in: first human contact.

158
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,986
做得好,看着录影带再做一次
Good try. Watch the video and try again.

159
00:21:01,837 --> 00:21:04,381
真是惊人,是不是? 他的学习能力超乎想像
-Impressive, isn't he? -He's exceeding expectations.

160
00:21:06,425 --> 00:21:09,720
你们感到很高兴,对吧？
You guys are pretty happy with yourselves, aren't you?

161
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,890
你们不知道他有什么潜能
You have no idea what you're getting into there.

162
00:21:13,182 --> 00:21:16,602
我想他第一件会做的事,是去杀11个女人
I've seen what he's able to do firsthand to 11 women.

163
00:21:16,977 --> 00:21:22,108
如果事实证明他跟凶手一样,我们会很遗憾
If this thing turns out to be anything like the original, we're gonna regret it.

164
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:26,237
还好,一旦用毕,就可以处理掉复制人
At the end of the day, Replicant is disposable.

165
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,495
别紧张
Take it easy.

166
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,334
这是食物
Food.

167
00:21:46,715 --> 00:21:47,550
吃吧
Eat!

168
00:21:54,682 --> 00:21:55,850
我是杰克
I'm Jake.

169
00:22:12,158 --> 00:22:14,827
你喜欢吗？觉得如何？
You like that? How about this?

170
00:22:18,414 --> 00:22:20,791
觉得如何？
How's that?

171
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,421
嘿,这里
Here, here.

172
00:22:33,804 --> 00:22:36,766
好,这里,看那里
Okay. Here. Look at that.

173
00:22:44,523 --> 00:22:46,067
你喜欢吗？
You like that?

174
00:22:53,949 --> 00:22:58,037
你很强壮嘛,放轻松
Strong, huh? Easy! Take it easy!

175
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:03,709
别紧张
Take it easy!

176
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,756
退后,退后
Back up! Back!

177
00:23:09,465 --> 00:23:11,759
轻松,退后
Easy! Back!

178
00:23:17,223 --> 00:23:18,307
现在坐下
Now, sit!

179
00:23:20,684 --> 00:23:21,435
坐下
Sit!

180
00:23:27,274 --> 00:23:28,651
我站起来了
I'm standing.

181
00:23:30,945 --> 00:23:32,279
我在走路
I'm walking.

182
00:23:34,407 --> 00:23:35,491
我坐下来
I'm sitting.

183
00:23:36,826 --> 00:23:37,827
我站起来了
Standing.

184
00:23:39,161 --> 00:23:40,162
我在走路
I'm walking.

185
00:23:41,414 --> 00:23:42,957
我坐下来
I'm sitting.

186
00:23:43,499 --> 00:23:45,292
我站起来 别动
-I'm standing. -Stay!

187
00:23:54,552 --> 00:23:56,846
不对,走路
No. Walk.

188
00:24:01,892 --> 00:24:03,978
来吧,我们走
Move. Let's go.

189
00:24:15,906 --> 00:24:17,408
把太阳眼镜给我
Give me your glasses.

190
00:24:20,161 --> 00:24:22,913
值五百块,小心点 是啊
-Those are $500 sunglasses. -Yeah?

191
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:26,834
看吧
Look.

192
00:24:29,879 --> 00:24:30,880
谢谢
Thank you.

193
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:40,765
我该怎么处理这家伙？拿到他的使用手册？
Do I get an owner's manual on this guy, or what?

194
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:44,143
你只能等他心中的杀机出现
You do whatever it takes to awaken the killer inside.

195
00:24:44,226 --> 00:24:47,730
这是国安局临时工作证明,还有你的枪
Here are your temporary NSF papers. And your gun.

196
00:24:47,855 --> 00:24:50,483
知道了 你每十二小时要向我报告一次
-Got it. -I want a report every 12 hours.

197
00:24:50,775 --> 00:24:54,445
好,我们走吧
Okay. Let's go. Walk!

198
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,625
坐下
Sit.

199
00:25:18,385 --> 00:25:20,846
杀人犯的睡觉模样真是可爱
Sleeping killer. How sweet.

200
00:25:23,724 --> 00:25:25,643
是啊,我们有同伴了
We've got company.

201
00:26:24,452 --> 00:26:26,078
好了,科学怪人
Okay, freak-of-science.

202
00:26:27,371 --> 00:26:30,708
我们就从这里开始谈起,你想到什么了?
Let's talk a little shop here, shall we? What do you remember?

203
00:26:32,042 --> 00:26:34,837
你想到什么了,快点
What do you remember? Come on.

204
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,840
你这个杀人犯,你想杀人吗？
Are you a killer? You feel like killing?

205
00:26:38,466 --> 00:26:41,886
除了女人,喜欢杀任何人？让我看看你是怎么做的
Killing somebody other than a woman? Show me how you did it.

206
00:26:42,845 --> 00:26:44,597
让我看看你是怎么做的，来呀
Show me how you did it, come on.

207
00:26:44,805 --> 00:26:47,683
让我看看你是他妈怎么做的
Show me how you fucking did it.

208
00:26:49,727 --> 00:26:51,103
记得这个吗？
Remember that?

209
00:26:57,902 --> 00:26:58,903
拿去
Take it.

210
00:27:05,618 --> 00:27:06,786
拿好
Here.

211
00:27:08,412 --> 00:27:11,540
你想杀我吗？机会来了
Want to kill me? Here's your chance.

212
00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:15,700
Do it.

213
00:27:16,378 --> 00:27:17,379
动手吧
Do it.

214
00:27:18,631 --> 00:27:19,632
动手吧
Do it.

215
00:27:22,551 --> 00:27:25,471
把枪放下，把枪放下！
Drop the gun! Drop the gun!

216
00:27:26,222 --> 00:27:28,099
三位大狗熊来救我了
Three stooges to the rescue.

217
00:27:29,433 --> 00:27:33,187
保持冷静,不要射到目标。杰克,叫他退后
Stay calm. Do not shoot the subject. Jake, tell him to back off!

218
00:27:34,188 --> 00:27:35,648
不,开枪杀了他
Just shoot him. Kill him.

219
00:27:36,565 --> 00:27:40,403
杰克你真该死 好了,兄弟们,放轻松
-Goddamn it, Jake. -Okay, boys. Take it easy.

220
00:27:40,569 --> 00:27:43,447
你们把枪放下，他可能也会那么做的
Maybe if you put your guns down, he'll do the same.

221
00:27:56,043 --> 00:27:57,044
很好
That's good.

222
00:28:00,256 --> 00:28:04,301
如果你再做出妨碍计划的事,我们会把他带回去
You deliberately jeopardised a classified project. We're taking him back.

223
00:28:06,053 --> 00:28:07,596
太好了
Good riddance.

224
00:28:08,472 --> 00:28:10,015
他一点用处都没有
He's useless.

225
00:29:32,723 --> 00:29:34,809
非常好 你弄断了我的胳膊！
-Very nice. -You broke my arm!

226
00:29:35,726 --> 00:29:38,396
让他们看看你的厉害
You shouldn't have showed him the moves!

227
00:29:40,732 --> 00:29:41,811
No!

228
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,028
受伤了？
Hurts, don't it?

229
00:29:50,157 --> 00:29:52,243
不要动 不
-Freeze! -No!

230
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,954
你知道这是百万计划 不是告诉过你不能杀他吗？
Million-dollar project! No shooting, remember?

231
00:29:55,329 --> 00:29:56,580
把枪拿开
Put it away!

232
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,199
That's it. Put it away!

233
00:30:00,751 --> 00:30:02,545
不要动
Stay! No!

234
00:30:03,838 --> 00:30:04,755
别动
Stay!

235
00:30:05,465 --> 00:30:06,496
Here.

236
00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:08,050
坐
Sit.

237
00:30:11,971 --> 00:30:13,055
别动
Stay.

238
00:30:15,975 --> 00:30:16,976
很好
Good.

239
00:30:17,101 --> 00:30:19,478
我会替你叫计程车. 走路
I'll call you a cab. Walk.

240
00:30:20,771 --> 00:30:21,772
走路
Walk.

241
00:30:38,539 --> 00:30:39,571
Yeah, hi.

242
00:30:39,665 --> 00:30:42,293
嗨,我想要跟您约个时间去看伯克雷的房子
I'd like an appointment to see the house on Berkeley.

243
00:30:42,376 --> 00:30:45,713
我叫杰克莱利 把枪放下
-My name is Jake Riley. -Drop the gun!

244
00:30:46,547 --> 00:30:47,298
闭嘴
Shut up!

245
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:48,382
对不起
Excuse me?

246
00:30:48,466 --> 00:30:50,593
抱歉,是收音机里的声音
Sorry. It was the radio.

247
00:30:52,553 --> 00:30:55,389
半小时,太棒了,谢谢
Half hour. Great. Thank you.

248
00:31:08,819 --> 00:31:09,904
你知道这个地方吗？
You know this place?

249
00:31:11,322 --> 00:31:14,909
一年前这房子因你而声名大噪
A year ago, you made it the most famous house in the country.

250
00:31:15,201 --> 00:31:16,619
真是一团糟
Real messy.

251
00:31:25,211 --> 00:31:27,296
快点,退后,冷静一点
Come on! Get back! Calm the fuck down.

252
00:31:27,421 --> 00:31:30,424
听到没有,冷静一点
You hear me? Calm the fuck down.

253
00:31:35,304 --> 00:31:37,306
好了,走吧
Okay. Let's go.

254
00:31:41,936 --> 00:31:43,854
只是下雨而已,来吧
It's just rain. Come on.

255
00:31:47,274 --> 00:31:50,528
今天天气如何？您是杰克莱利吗？
How about this weather? Jake Riley?

256
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,363
我是温蒂卫尔康
Wendy Wyckham.

257
00:31:55,408 --> 00:31:56,742
冷静一点
Calm the fuck down.

258
00:31:57,035 --> 00:31:58,066
No.

259
00:31:59,286 --> 00:32:02,498
抱歉,我的表弟兰利有点特别
Sorry. My cousin Ron is a little special.

260
00:32:04,834 --> 00:32:08,337
我带你们进去 乖一点
-Let me show you in. -Be good! Come on.

261
00:32:09,046 --> 00:32:11,090
这栋房子建于1926年
This house was built in 1926.

262
00:32:11,257 --> 00:32:13,717
所有的木工都是原来的模样
All the woodwork is original.

263
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:18,931
一进门就看到温暖的小火炉,感觉很特别
A nice cosy fireplace here makes the entrance that much more special.

264
00:32:19,014 --> 00:32:21,767
这里是一间大起居室
Over here, we have a spacious living room.

265
00:32:24,603 --> 00:32:26,021
这边请
This way.

266
00:32:27,231 --> 00:32:31,485
我们现在看到的是厨房,才刚翻修过
Here, we go into the kitchen which has recently been remodelled.

267
00:32:31,736 --> 00:32:35,072
所有的大理石都是法国货
All the marble, of course, imported from Florence.

268
00:32:35,531 --> 00:32:39,910
这里是餐厅,很适合款待宾客
And over here, we have the dining room. It's perfect for entertaining.

269
00:32:40,244 --> 00:32:42,455
您说您是从事哪一行的？
What line of work did you say you were in?

270
00:32:42,538 --> 00:32:44,123
我是干警察的
I was in law enforcement.

271
00:32:45,124 --> 00:32:50,087
没错,你是电视上的那位警察 你在侦办一起凶杀案
That's right. You're that TV cop. The Torch case.

272
00:32:50,171 --> 00:32:51,255
真的是太好了
I feel so much better.

273
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:54,884
你知道这座房子的历史吗？ 我知道
-You know the history of the house? -Yes, I do.

274
00:32:55,176 --> 00:32:58,763
真是太可异了,许多人都无法摆脱过去的阴影
You know, it's such a shame because most people can never get past it.

275
00:32:58,846 --> 00:33:00,257
But it is a steal.

276
00:33:00,681 --> 00:33:02,516
但这栋房子真的是物超所值
Way below market value.

277
00:33:04,477 --> 00:33:08,064
他没事吧？ 你能让我们独处一下吗？
-Is he okay? -Could you give us a minute, please?

278
00:33:09,315 --> 00:33:10,858
当然可以
Absolutely.

279
00:33:13,569 --> 00:33:14,570
走吧
Let's go.

280
00:33:16,155 --> 00:33:17,156
走路
Walk.

281
00:33:28,667 --> 00:33:29,668
走吧，快
Let's go.

282
00:33:53,567 --> 00:33:54,985
你想起什么来了？
What do you remember?

283
00:34:09,458 --> 00:34:12,420
什么？你想到了什么？
What? What is it? What do you see?

284
00:35:05,222 --> 00:35:09,143
他以前来过这里吗？ 是另外一个人来过
-Has he been here before? -In another life.

285
00:35:11,771 --> 00:35:13,272
走吧
Let's go.

286
00:35:14,106 --> 00:35:17,693
我不想回家,我想去公园
I don't want to go home. I want to go to the park! Now!

287
00:35:18,402 --> 00:35:21,822
强尼,住口,你是个坏孩子
Johnny, stop it! You're a bad boy.

288
00:35:45,763 --> 00:35:47,473
孩子，你还好吧？
-How you doing, kiddo? -Good.

289
00:35:48,307 --> 00:35:51,268
跳上来，来吧
Come on! Jump up!

290
00:35:51,352 --> 00:35:52,728
跳上来
Up you go!

291
00:35:54,688 --> 00:35:57,358
你是个好孩子吗？
How you doing? You've been a good boy?

292
00:35:57,483 --> 00:35:59,110
跳上来
Up you go!

293
00:36:01,904 --> 00:36:05,408
一切都还好吧？ 很好,妈妈在做你最喜欢吃的菜
-How's things going? -Good! Mommy's making your favourite.

294
00:36:05,533 --> 00:36:06,909
真的是太好了
I like that.

295
00:36:07,284 --> 00:36:09,495
去帮我抱抱你妈妈，快去
Go give Mommy a hug for me. Go!

296
00:36:19,755 --> 00:36:20,840
要乖一点
Be good.

297
00:36:21,006 --> 00:36:23,551
丹尼，到楼上去好吗,让小康陪你去？
Danny, go on upstairs, okay? And take Scout with you.

298
00:36:23,759 --> 00:36:25,511
好吗? 小康，来吧
-Okay? -Scout, come!

299
00:36:30,182 --> 00:36:31,350
来吧
Come on.

300
00:36:40,568 --> 00:36:42,027
坐下
Sit. Down.

301
00:36:49,493 --> 00:36:52,037
你想告诉我这是怎么回事？
You want to tell me what the hell is going on?

302
00:36:53,122 --> 00:36:56,250
这是机密。如果我告诉你，就得杀了你
Classified. If I told you I'd have to kill you.

303
00:36:56,667 --> 00:36:58,002
事情非同小可
That's not funny.

304
00:36:59,295 --> 00:37:02,089
抱歉，我知道.听着,我需要你的帮助
Sorry, I know. Listen, I need your help.

305
00:37:02,214 --> 00:37:05,718
我需尽快找地方安置这家伙
I've got to get a rendering of this guy as soon as possible.

306
00:37:06,635 --> 00:37:08,763
我不会帮你这个忙的
I'm not going to do that for you.

307
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:12,141
我得遵守规定，没忘记吧？
That's against department policy. Remember?

308
00:37:13,309 --> 00:37:15,853
所以我才会来求你帮忙
That's why it's considered a favour.

309
00:37:40,377 --> 00:37:43,798
喔，好恶心，那不能吃!
That's gross! Don't eat that!

310
00:37:44,215 --> 00:37:47,551
那是给狗吃的,拿去,吃吃看
That's for doggies. Here. Try this.

311
00:37:56,185 --> 00:37:57,520
还要吗？
Want some more?

312
00:38:04,735 --> 00:38:07,279
你该说谢谢的
You're supposed to say, "Thank you."

313
00:38:20,459 --> 00:38:21,710
怎么了？
What happened?

314
00:38:22,711 --> 00:38:23,963
宝贝，发生什么事了？
Baby, what happened?

315
00:38:30,845 --> 00:38:32,346
到这来，起来！
Come here. Get up!

316
00:38:33,556 --> 00:38:36,100
你这混蛋,你对他做了什么？
You son of a bitch! What did you do to him?

317
00:38:36,517 --> 00:38:38,144
小康咬我的舌头
Scout hit me in the tooth.

318
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:42,064
小康？等一下，杰克
It was Scout? Wait a second.

319
00:38:43,274 --> 00:38:45,484
杰克，住手，不是他干的
Stop! It wasn't him.

320
00:38:45,609 --> 00:38:50,656
小康咬伤他的舌头,是狗干的，不是他干的
Scout knocked his tooth out. It was the dog. It wasn't him.

321
00:39:30,321 --> 00:39:31,864
发生什么事了？
What happened?

322
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:34,533
我踢了他几脚，一场误会而已
I kicked the shit out of him. Honest mistake.

323
00:39:34,825 --> 00:39:38,037
杰克,已过了18个钟头.你带他逃跑，要他攻击我的人
It's been 18 hours. You've gone AWOL, let him attack my men...

324
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:41,040
现在你还告诉我虐待我的复制人?
...and now you're telling me you've mistreated my replicant?

325
00:39:41,123 --> 00:39:43,959
或许是我判断错误 或许你说得对
-Perhaps I made an error in judgment. -Perhaps you did.

326
00:39:44,251 --> 00:39:48,923
或许你该把你的实验品带走.我才不需要你的混蛋
Perhaps you should take your experiment and go. I don't need your shit.

327
00:39:49,632 --> 00:39:54,136
杀人犯和你说话后打算如何？我以为你想逮住他
After what the Torch said to you, I thought you'd really want to nail him.

328
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,097
你怎么知道他是怎么说我的？
How do you know what he said to me?

329
00:39:57,598 --> 00:40:00,059
你窃听我的电话，是吗？
You got my place wired, is that it?

330
00:40:01,644 --> 00:40:03,354
你怎么知道我们今天在哪里？
How did you know where we were today?

331
00:40:03,521 --> 00:40:05,272
你也在追踪我们？
You tracking us, too?

332
00:40:05,564 --> 00:40:09,068
你想我们会在不了解你的状况下
You think we'd let you out with the future of our national security...

333
00:40:09,151 --> 00:40:11,278
把国家安全机密交给你吗？
...without knowing everything about you?

334
00:40:11,404 --> 00:40:13,781
每隔12小时你要向我报告一次
I expect a report every 12 hours.

335
00:40:15,116 --> 00:40:16,659
不准有例外状况
No exceptions.

336
00:40:30,673 --> 00:40:32,967
杰克，是你吗？ 对啊，妈，是我
-Is that you? -Yeah, it's me, Mom.

337
00:40:36,262 --> 00:40:37,847
把衣服脱掉
Get your clothes off.

338
00:40:38,431 --> 00:40:41,851
对，好，不要动
That's it. Good. Stay!

339
00:40:48,399 --> 00:40:50,526
一定不在车内，那太明显了
Not in the car. Too obvious.

340
00:40:50,693 --> 00:40:51,777
让我看看你的牙齿
Let's see.

341
00:40:52,945 --> 00:40:55,406
在嘴里，对吗？张大一点
Internal, is that it? Open.

342
00:40:56,198 --> 00:41:00,244
内置追踪器,他们自以为聪明
Internal tracking device. They think they're real smart.

343
00:41:00,995 --> 00:41:03,706
放在嘴里，真聪明不是吗？
Internal. Smart, isn't it?

344
00:41:06,584 --> 00:41:10,796
没事，冷静
It's okay. Calm down.

345
00:41:20,222 --> 00:41:22,308
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

346
00:41:22,391 --> 00:41:23,768
妈，我在工作
I'm working, Ma.

347
00:41:23,934 --> 00:41:27,229
没事，事情不是像你想像那样
It's okay. It's not what you think.

348
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,152
妈，我们出去
Let's go, Ma.

349
00:41:34,528 --> 00:41:35,529
杰克
Jacob!

350
00:41:35,654 --> 00:41:37,615
什么事？ 那个人被打得满身是伤
-What? -That man was beaten up.

351
00:41:37,698 --> 00:41:40,326
妈，你根本不认识他
Ma, you don't even know the guy, okay.

352
00:41:41,035 --> 00:41:44,705
杰克，等一下，我说的是你
Wait a minute! I'm talking about you.

353
00:41:45,164 --> 00:41:47,917
你到底是怎么了?发生了什么事？
What is the matter with you? What has happened?

354
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,170
你是怎么了?你为什么要那样子对他?
-What's wrong with you? -Why are you treating people like that?

355
00:41:51,253 --> 00:41:54,298
妈，拜托别说了
Mom, stop. Please.

356
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,301
好吧，但是你给我记住一件事
Okay. But remember one thing:

357
00:41:57,676 --> 00:42:02,390
如果你把别人当成罪犯看待,他们早晚会变成罪犯的
If you treat people like criminals, that is exactly what they will become.

358
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,602
你的晚餐在冰箱里,我回家了
Your dinner's in the fridge. I'm going home.

359
00:42:28,457 --> 00:42:29,834
谢谢
Thank you.

360
00:42:53,566 --> 00:42:55,276
我无法忍耐了
I can't take it!

361
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,279
你毁了我的一生
You have ruined my life.

362
00:43:00,156 --> 00:43:02,950
你在哪里？
Where are you?

363
00:43:04,118 --> 00:43:05,953
Bad boy! 坏孩子
Bad boy!

364
00:43:08,456 --> 00:43:10,291
你得接受惩罚
You must be punished!

365
00:43:14,879 --> 00:43:16,338
你是个坏母亲
You're a bad mother.

366
00:43:17,548 --> 00:43:19,091
嘿，你没事吧？
Hey, you all right?

367
00:43:20,301 --> 00:43:22,094
放开她
Leave her alone!

368
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:56,045
别激动，兄弟
Easy, man.

369
00:44:02,843 --> 00:44:05,137
谢谢帮忙，我欠你一次
Thanks for the favour. I owe you one now.

370
00:44:05,388 --> 00:44:07,056
算了吧
Forget about it.

371
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:09,558
看这里,不要动
Right here. Stay.

372
00:44:12,603 --> 00:44:13,932
Subject loaded.

373
00:44:17,483 --> 00:44:19,610
好，我们来看看你还记得什么
Okay, let's see what you remember.

374
00:44:19,693 --> 00:44:21,570
这个如何？
How about this one?

375
00:44:21,654 --> 00:44:23,406
还记得那个吗？
Remember that one?

376
00:44:24,198 --> 00:44:26,158
快跟我说
Come on, talk to me.

377
00:44:26,242 --> 00:44:29,537
开始扫描照片了 快一点，好吗？
The picture's scanned. Make it snappy, all right?

378
00:45:08,701 --> 00:45:10,786
坐下，快坐下
Sit down. Go on, sit.

379
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:15,708
爱德华沙佛德
"Edward Garrotte."

380
00:45:18,419 --> 00:45:22,173
显赫人物，1995年由南非移入
Outstanding. "Immigrated from South Africa, 1995."

381
00:45:33,434 --> 00:45:35,478
杰克? 警长，盘价情况还好吧？
-Jake? -Captain, how's the market?

382
00:45:35,561 --> 00:45:37,396
石油价格下滑
Well, oil prices are down.

383
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,065
你回这里来做什么？
What the hell are you doing here?

384
00:45:39,148 --> 00:45:41,776
我只是清掉一些档案,全部清完了
I was just cleaning up some files. All done now.

385
00:45:41,859 --> 00:45:45,446
你在开我玩笑？ 不，我得走了
-Are you jerking me around? -No, got to go.

386
00:45:47,865 --> 00:45:49,325
你在开我玩笑？
You're jerking me?

387
00:45:49,408 --> 00:45:50,409
闭嘴
Shut up.

388
00:45:59,794 --> 00:46:01,754
混蛋
Son of a bitch.

389
00:46:20,106 --> 00:46:21,273
待在这
Stay.

390
00:46:53,472 --> 00:46:54,807
走吧
Let's go.

391
00:47:39,477 --> 00:47:41,562
我的天啊
Jesus Christ.

392
00:47:50,488 --> 00:47:51,947
下一位受害者
Next victim.

393
00:47:52,865 --> 00:47:54,116
拿去
Keep it.

394
00:47:54,325 --> 00:47:56,702
杰克，我们是非法侵入民房
Jake, we have an illegal entry.

395
00:48:16,305 --> 00:48:18,307
真是丧心病狂
This is one sick puppy.

396
00:48:21,644 --> 00:48:23,771
凶手,你抓到他了，
The Torch. You got him.

397
00:48:23,854 --> 00:48:26,649
就坐在你车子里 不是这样，我稍后再解释
-That's him in the car. -No. I'll explain later.

398
00:48:45,126 --> 00:48:47,670
杰克，我得通知总部
Jake, I've got to call this one in.

399
00:49:14,155 --> 00:49:15,483
You...

400
00:49:15,573 --> 00:49:17,533
退后!
...back off!

401
00:49:23,664 --> 00:49:26,584
快出去，快闪开
Get out! Go!

402
00:49:58,282 --> 00:49:59,950
快打电话求救
Call for help.

403
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:03,162
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

404
00:50:03,829 --> 00:50:05,706
他在哪里？他一定知道
Where is he? He knew.

405
00:50:36,112 --> 00:50:39,615
杰克!这是怎么一回事？
Jake! What the hell's going on?

406
00:50:40,282 --> 00:50:42,952
告诉我这是怎么一回事 现在不行，我把他弄丢了
-What's going on? -Not now! I'm gonna lose him.

407
00:50:43,035 --> 00:50:45,121
他是凶手，就在你车子里
That's the Torch. You got the Torch in the car.

408
00:50:45,204 --> 00:50:47,206
不，不是他,他只是个饵
No, it's not him. He's the key.

409
00:50:47,289 --> 00:50:49,917

她是饭店的客人吗？

It doesn't matter who I am. She's in danger.

554
01:07:49,729 --> 01:07:53,566

I'm very sorry, sir, but hotel regulations strictly forbid....

555
01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:56,026
对不起

01:07:59,697 --> 01:08:03,200

他想杀你

590

我会保护你的，兄弟

兄弟
Brother.

592
01:12:09,822 --> 01:12:12,533
你要去哪里
Where are you?

593
01:12:13,617 --> 01:12:14,785
我们是一样的
We are identical.

594
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:17,580
别挡路 一样的

别挡路

01:12:21,292 --> 01:12:23,085
别挡路
Get out of the way!

走开
Move!

598
01:12:36,932 --> 01:12:38,559
你把他放走了
You let him get away!

01:12:39,018 --> 01:12:40,436
我们都一样
We are the same.

600
01:12:40,770 --> 01:12:42,480
我应该把你们两个都杀了

601
01:12:42,563 --> 01:12:45,775
天啊，他是在骗你啊
Goddamn you! He's screwing with your mind!

602
01:12:46,692 --> 01:12:48,444

605
01:13:14,136 --> 01:13:16,680
我们两个是一样的 闭嘴
-We are the same. -Shut up!

606
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:20,976
杰克，你负责侦办这案子吗？ 不是
-Jake, are you on the case? -No!

607
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:22,937
你重回警界了？ 我退休了
-Are you back on the force? -I'm retired.

608
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:24,855
可以透露其它更好的消息吗？
Can you say something better than that?

609
01:13:24,939 --> 01:13:28,109
是一个拒绝负责任的人
Look, this is an individual who refuses to take responsibility.

610
01:13:28,192 --> 01:13:30,861
就我所知，他不负责任
As far as I know, he's not taking responsibility.

611
01:13:30,945 --> 01:13:33,906
他是个该死的大混蛋，没什么
He's a fucking nutcase, that's all.

612
01:13:39,829 --> 01:13:41,539
我一直在等你的电话
I've been waiting for your call.

613
01:13:41,622 --> 01:13:44,375
我知道，威士忌还好喝吧？

614
01:13:48,713 --> 01:13:49,714
很好喝
It's fine.

615
01:13:49,964 --> 01:13:51,215
我的复制人还好吧？
How's my replicant?

616
01:13:51,298 --> 01:13:52,633
他很好
He's good.

617
01:13:53,843 --> 01:13:55,845
把电话接上扩音器
Put us on the speakerphone.

618
01:13:56,679 --> 01:13:58,055
我为什么要那么做？
Why would I want to do that?

619
01:13:58,139 --> 01:14:01,892
我们可以谈谈，就像家人一样.我要你们俩都能听到我说话
We can talk, like family. I want both of you to hear me.

620
01:14:03,185 --> 01:14:04,937
好了，说吧
Go ahead and talk.

621
01:14:05,688 --> 01:14:08,232
我要他知道我有多爱他
I want him to know how much I love him.

622
01:14:08,315 --> 01:14:11,110
他对我来说意义重大
What it means to me to have him in this world.

623
01:14:11,193 --> 01:14:12,528
太棒了
How nice.

624
01:14:13,237 --> 01:14:14,697
病态的爱
Psycho love.

625
01:14:15,072 --> 01:14:17,950
想知道下一位受害者是谁吗？
So, do you want to know who's my next victim?

626
01:14:18,325 --> 01:14:19,994
去问我的兄弟吧
Ask my brother.

627
01:14:21,621 --> 01:14:22,783
Jake.

628
01:14:24,165 --> 01:14:25,750
你还在等什么？
What are you waiting for?

629
01:14:25,958 --> 01:14:27,585
杰克，我在等时机
In time, Jake.

630
01:14:28,085 --> 01:14:29,336
等时机
In time.

631
01:14:32,757 --> 01:14:36,052
给我一个理由,否则把你的脑袋轰掉
Give me a reason, I'll blow your fucking head off.

632
01:14:41,599 --> 01:14:44,310
把手伸出来,把手伸出来
Give me your hand. Give me your hand.

633
01:14:59,075 --> 01:15:01,744
沙佛德先生，你好 卡罗，你好
-Hello, Mr. Savard. -Hi, Carol.

634
01:15:02,703 --> 01:15:06,123
我妈今天情况如何？ 她今天比较好
-How's Mama today? -Well, she's had better days.

635
01:15:06,248 --> 01:15:09,418
或许看到你，她会高兴一点 我要给她一个惊喜
-Maybe you can cheer her up. -I've got a surprise for her.

636

637
01:15:27,311 --> 01:15:28,813
这一个
And this one.

638
01:15:29,939 --> 01:15:33,526
我把她给分尸了,慢慢地分尸
I cut her good. Very slow.

639
01:15:35,403 --> 01:15:37,279
我真希望你当时也在现场
I wish you were there.

640
01:15:38,906 --> 01:15:40,574
她一直求我
She was begging.

641
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:43,202
一直尖叫
Screaming.

642
01:15:47,456 --> 01:15:51,127
坏孩子，你应该受到惩罚,坏孩子
Bad boy, you must be punished! Bad boy!

643
01:15:53,295 --> 01:15:55,089
你知道原因吗？
But you know what?

644
01:15:56,549 --> 01:15:58,259
我是为你才这么做的
I did it for you.

645
01:15:58,968 --> 01:16:02,555
你是个坏孩子
You bad boy!

646
01:16:05,141 --> 01:16:07,226
你应该受到惩罚
You must be punished!

647
01:16:09,729 --> 01:16:10,725
No.

648
01:16:14,316 --> 01:16:17,361
不再是了，你这个婊子
No more, you bitch.

649
01:16:22,074 --> 01:16:23,325
不再是了
No more.

650
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:48,893
我真不该生下你
You should never have been born!

651
01:16:48,976 --> 01:17:05,951
卢克沙佛德
Luc Savard.

652
01:17:07,828 --> 01:17:09,705
杰克，我查到了,是卢克沙佛德
Jake, I got it. Luc Savard.

653
01:17:09,955 --> 01:17:12,792
天啊，真是坏孩子,11岁开始行窃
Jesus, talk about a bad boy. Shoplifting at 11...

654
01:17:12,875 --> 01:17:14,668
曾偷过车子、吸毒、纵火
...grand-theft auto, narcotics, arson.

655
01:17:15,211 --> 01:17:16,962
1988年加入海军陆战队
He enlisted in the corps in '88.

Reportedly killed behind enemy lines in June of '91.

657
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,967
但是一直没找到尸体
But the body was never recovered.

658
01:17:22,802 --> 01:17:24,595
我追踪过他的母亲
And I tracked down his mother.

659
01:17:24,845 --> 01:17:27,973
温德妮沙佛德,六年前中风后,
Gwendolyn Savard. She was committed to the Nepenthe Home...

660
01:17:28,057 --> 01:17:30,216
就住在内彭斯疗养院
...six years ago, after a stroke.

661
01:17:31,268 --> 01:17:32,770
杰克，你猜怎么了？
One other thing:

662
01:17:32,853 --> 01:17:34,355
这个女人杀了她的丈夫
This woman killed her husband.

663
01:17:34,438 --> 01:17:37,650
把小孩锁在柜子里后,再放火把房子烧掉
She locked the kid up in a closet and then set the house on fire.

664
01:17:37,775 --> 01:17:41,195
卢克沙佛德能够活下来,是因为那天下雨
Luc Savard only lived because it rained that night.

665
01:17:53,874 --> 01:17:55,126
沙佛德先生？
Mr. Savard?

666
01:17:59,088 --> 01:18:01,465
我们昨晚试图打电话连络你
We tried to call you last night.

667
01:18:05,636 --> 01:18:08,180
他昨晚来过这里？ 没错
-He was here last night? -Of course.

668
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:11,642
我很遗憾,你母亲...
I'm sorry, your mother....

669
01:18:12,768 --> 01:18:15,855
昨晚突然心脏衰竭,我们尽力救治
She had a sudden cardiac arrest. We did everything we could.

670
01:18:15,938 --> 01:18:17,940
可惜回天乏术
She was just too frail.

671
01:18:18,566 --> 01:18:19,984
这是她的东西
Her things.

672
01:18:27,867 --> 01:18:28,868
对不起
Excuse me.

673
01:18:29,076 --> 01:18:31,954
可以看她的遗容吗？ 当然可以
-May we see the body? -Yes. Of course.

674
01:19:07,656 --> 01:19:09,408
杰克，别激动
Take it easy, Jake.

675
01:19:09,492 --> 01:19:12,036
你要她死吗？你要吗？
You want her to die? Do you?

676
01:19:12,787 --> 01:19:14,538
把枪放下
Your gun, drop it.

677
01:19:19,377 --> 01:19:20,920
把枪放下
Drop your gun.

678
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:24,215
很好
Good.

679
01:19:25,132 --> 01:19:26,759
显然你不够聪明
You're not so smart.

680
01:19:27,051 --> 01:19:29,095
你不会再看到我走进来
You never saw me coming.

681
01:19:32,681 --> 01:19:34,475
杰克，一切都结束了
This is it, Jake.

682
01:19:35,726 --> 01:19:37,645
你死定了
You're going to die.

683
01:19:55,121 --> 01:19:57,248
杰克，怎么了？
So, what's the matter, Jake?

684
01:20:02,336 --> 01:20:04,088
没想到我会回来吧？
No smart comeback?

685
01:20:13,764 --> 01:20:15,891
记者不在场，真无趣
No reporters to joke with?

686
01:20:26,902 --> 01:20:28,779
他不是你的家人
He's not your family.

687
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,407
他不在乎你
He doesn't care about you.

688
01:20:32,616 --> 01:20:35,661
但我在乎你,所以我要你跟我一起
But I do. That's why I want you with me.

689
01:20:37,788 --> 01:20:39,373
我有个想法
I have an idea.

690
01:20:43,502 --> 01:20:45,421
你去杀了他
You're gonna kill him.

691
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:50,968
杀了他
Do it.

692
01:20:53,054 --> 01:20:54,472
把他干掉
Finish him.

693
01:20:56,432 --> 01:20:57,463
Yeah.

694
01:21:09,528 --> 01:21:10,529
不
No.

695
01:21:21,957 --> 01:21:24,335
那你就得跟他一起死
That's why you're going to die with him.

696
01:21:24,460 --> 01:21:27,254
他们以为你就是我
And they'll think you are me.

697
01:21:28,964 --> 01:21:31,258
卢克沙佛德，你是个坏孩子
You are a bad boy, Luc Savard.

698
01:21:38,516 --> 01:21:40,017
你说什么？
What did you say?

699
01:21:40,101 --> 01:21:42,395
卢克沙佛德，你是个坏孩子
You are a bad boy, Luc Savard.

700
01:21:43,979 --> 01:21:45,356
你杀了妈妈
You killed Mama.

701
01:21:46,232 --> 01:21:47,263
Yes.

702
01:21:47,691 --> 01:21:51,529
是，那又怎么样？感觉不坏啊
That's right. And so what? It felt good.

703
01:21:52,238 --> 01:21:53,614
你这个妓女
You bitch!

704
01:22:47,543 --> 01:22:50,796
你会没事的
Okay. You're gonna be okay.

705
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:52,965
别动，我马上回来
Don't move. I'll be back.

706
01:23:08,189 --> 01:23:09,440
你要做什么？
There he is!

707
01:23:43,224 --> 01:23:44,892
他在哪里？ 他下去那边了
-Where is he? -He's down there.

708
01:27:19,982 --> 01:27:21,067
我的天啊
Damn!

709
01:28:48,195 --> 01:28:51,615
嘿，妈妈的好孩子
Not bad for a mama's boy?

710
01:28:51,741 --> 01:28:54,952
现在可以称为一则新闻了吗？还是稍后呢？
Should I call the news now or later?

711
01:29:06,589 --> 01:29:07,423
住手
Stop it.

712
01:29:16,432 --> 01:29:20,019
如果你杀了我,也就毁了你自己
If you kill me, you kill yourself.

713
01:29:26,484 --> 01:29:28,110
卢克沙佛德，保险锁没打开
The safety, Luc Savard.

714
01:30:05,731 --> 01:30:08,526
为什么你能感应到我？
What makes you think you can take me?

715
01:30:35,428 --> 01:30:37,471
我可以看穿你的心思
I can read your mind.

716
01:32:35,089 --> 01:32:37,717
看着我，醒醒，复制人
Look at me. Come on, buddy.

717
01:32:41,137 --> 01:32:43,264
看着我 杰克
-Look at me. -Jake.

718
01:32:46,642 --> 01:32:48,519
我的家人都死了
My family's gone.

719
01:32:55,651 --> 01:32:58,612
他不是你的家人
He's not your family.

720
01:32:59,488 --> 01:33:02,908
现在我是你的家人了
I'm your family. I'm your family now.

721
01:33:05,870 --> 01:33:09,623
杰克，我看见雨了
Jake, I see rain...

722
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:12,334
在我眼睛里
...in my eyes.

723
01:33:12,710 --> 01:33:14,128
我看见雨了
I see rain.

724
01:33:50,539 --> 01:33:51,874
开门
Open up!

725
01:33:55,002 --> 01:33:56,587
把门打开
Open the door!

726
01:33:58,631 --> 01:34:00,549
把该死的门打开!
Open the goddamn door!

727
01:34:25,074 --> 01:34:29,328
唯一能辨认的是冰柜里的尸体
Well, the only ones who made it were the corpses in the fridge drawers.

728
01:34:29,495 --> 01:34:31,497
我要一份完整的报告
I expect a full report.

729
01:34:41,882 --> 01:34:44,760
丹尼，你或许名列第一,但我比你更棒
Danny, you may be in first but I'm better than you.

730
01:34:44,844 --> 01:34:45,845
才不是呢
No.

731
01:34:45,928 --> 01:34:48,639
不，我名列第一.但是谁最优秀呢？
No, I'm in first. Who's the best?

732
01:34:49,306 --> 01:34:50,391
是我
Me!

733
01:35:21,714 --> 01:35:23,758
你看到送信人了吗？ 没有
-Did you see the delivery-man? -No.

734
01:35:25,051 --> 01:35:26,719
我们去拿信吧
Let's go get it.

735
01:35:53,496 --> 01:35:55,039
他喜欢雨
He likes rain.

736
01:36:07,635 --> 01:36:09,303
嗨 嗨
-Hi. -Hi.

737
01:36:12,014 --> 01:36:13,891
我就知道你会回来
I knew you'd come back.

738
01:36:13,974 --> 01:36:16,352
我们离开这里吧，走吧
Let's get out of here. Let's go.
