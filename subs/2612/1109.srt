1
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:33,400
<i>The West...</i>

2
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:35,448
<i>People call it
"The New Frontier."</i>

3
00:00:37,453 --> 00:00:40,241
<i>It sounds almost nice.</i>

4
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:45,428
<i>They'll tell you it's built on the backs of
God-fearing folks</i>

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,897
<i>with true grit in their hands and the
American Dream in their hearts.</i>

6
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:55,585
<i>Well, whoever wrote that's
sellin' snake oil, sure as shit.</i>

7
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:02,266
<i>The real West is a heartless,
lawless viper pit.</i>

8
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:07,023
<i>An American nightmare,
forged by the flames of hell...</i>

9
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,350
<i>and the hammer of the beast.</i>

10
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,189
<i>I alreday know.</i>

11
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:14,656
<i>I am Lucifer...</i>

12
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,241
<i>and I devour the souls of men.</i>

13
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:22,287
<i>In the West, I never go hungry.</i>

14
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:58,116
Red Cavanaugh.
Murdering son of a bitch.

15
00:01:58,701 --> 00:01:59,733
Open up!

16
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,713
Do you renounce
the evil powers of this world

17
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,252
that corrupt and destroy
the creatures of God?

18
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:30,474
Do you renounce
the sinful desires

19
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,355
that draw you from
the love of God?

20
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,355
I got the beast in me, Father.

21
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:40,651
In His name, I will spill the blood of
every bull in this yard,

22
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,244
before that sun rises.

23
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,265
Guerrero!

24
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,180
Guerrero!

25
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:03,905
Guerrero!

26
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,130
Yeah!

27
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,708
His six months in hell are over.

28
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,086
Gracias.

29
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,296
De nada.

30
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,638
Hey, Baptiste,

31
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,564
I don't know what smells worse,
you or that shit you're making.

32
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,860
Thought you were French.

33
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,569
You want me to
shovel it up your cul?

34
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,314
Hey, hey, enough, eat it!

35
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,315
Do you want some?/
Fuck, no.

36
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,452
Still having them nightmares?

37
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,167
I seen him.

38
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,037
Seen who?

39
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,995
The demon that haunts my dreams.

40
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,050
Sure it was him?

41
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,304
It's my penance.

42
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,346
Hermano,
I got us a big score.

43
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,812
Could set us up for life.

44
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,015
Get us off this hand-to-mouth shit
we been doing.

45
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,530
I'm listening.

46
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,782
<i>It's a Colorado town.</i>

47
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,276
<i>They got 'em a stone
and quartz quarry.</i>

48
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,908
<i>Devil stones from Yuma prison
come from there.</i>

49
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,368
<i>Town called Edendale.</i>

50
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,701
<i>God's country.</i>

51
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,300
<i>Turns out, they struck
a vein of gold.</i>

52
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,714
Big one.

53
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,461
When?

54
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,139
Few months ago.

55
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:34,971
What else?

56
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,551
Well...

57
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,062
They been banking the gold up

58
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:43,111
because they got a little
mineral rights dispute happening.

59
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:46,314
You got no right, Judah Clark,
you got no right!

60
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,979
Mineral rights on the deed are
plain as day!

61
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,982
They belong to Edendale
and its founding members.

62
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,616
And you're staring
at the first one!

63
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,829
If you could read,
you would see that they say

64
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,075
you have the right
to pull gypsum from the quarry.

65
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,284
That is all.

66
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,341
Mineral rights
is mineral rights!

67
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,835
And everybody's gettin' greedy.

68
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,504
<i>Goddamned limey bastard!</i>

69
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,836
And I suggest you hold your tongue
when it comes to Mother England,

70
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,804
you tin-pan mongrel!
Hey!

71
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,602
God damn it, Jack! Do you want
to spend the night in the hole?

72
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,932
Guy on the inside says the sheriff's
getting real cagey, right?

73
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,394
<i>I am sworn to uphold the law.</i>

74
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,684
And the law says
all mineral disputes

75
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,185
gotta be settled by
the federal judge in Denver.

76
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:28,353
He's so stupid.

77
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,939
He didn't wanna move
the land transport to Denver.

78
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,111
He didn't wanna hire
personal security.

79
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:38,445
Till then, said goddamned minerals
will be impounded by local authorities.

80
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,412
That's me.

81
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,455
Take it to the vault.

82
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,333
And the sheriff's keepin' the gold
vaulted till they all settle.

83
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,967
In the bank?

84
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,046
That's stupid.

85
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:55,470
Now, personally,
I don't care who owns the gold.

86
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,348
What I care about is this town.

87
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:03,730
And I will be goddamned if I let it burn
on account of greed and graft.

88
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,560
Who else knows?

89
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,062
Far as I know, just me.

90
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,819
You sure about this?

91
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,820
Never more, hermano.

92
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,614
It's two hard days
ride to Colorado.

93
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,915
We ride at first light.

94
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:42,927
Rojo.

95
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,769
About your stretch...

96
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,277
No hard feelings?/
Forgive and forget.

97
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,237
Shit, I know things
ain't panned out in the past.

98
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,534
This is different, hermano.

99
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,242
This is different.

100
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,868
We're square.

101
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,409
Bueno.

102
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,618
Come on,...
Let's go!

103
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,498
What men?

104
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,216
Have you seen them before?

105
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,720
You should go get your husband/
That's a good idea/ Yeah.

106
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,525
Afternoon, boys.

107
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,025
Honey, we're a little busy, here,
right now.

108
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,648
Well, I guess Greedy
and Seedy, over here,

109
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,826
can't handle their affairs
like a couple of men.

110
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,999
And, speakin' of which,
a gang of gunfighters just rode into town.

111
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,089
Reckon they're headed
for the saloon.

112
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:38,847
<i>How you know
they're gunfighters?</i>

113
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:40,848
<i>Just a hunch, really.</i>

114
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:44,467
Seein' as they're all splattered in blood
and bristling with blue steel.

115
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,354
<i>That is rather disquieting, Sheriff.</i>

116
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,764
<i>Perhaps you should
go and talk to them.</i>

117
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:53,435
<i>About what, Judah? Ain't it legal to
pack iron in this county?</i>

118
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,567
Now, we got laws,
here in Edendale.

119
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:00,274
Soon as you see one of them
James Gang in the saloon breaking one,

120
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,702
you come and tell me.

121
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,946
Until that moment,
we've got business we need to settle here.

122
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,911
Home, sweet home, brother.

123
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,128
Darko, whiskey.

124
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,707
<i>Good afternoon.
What're you havin'?</i>

125
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,426
<i>Whiskey!</i>

126
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,427
Come here, come here.

127
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,858
Well, it doesn't look like a town
laden with gold, Red.

128
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:25,576
I told you boys, they're havin' a land
dispute in this town.

129
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,449
Gold's all locked up
till the judge makes a decision.

130
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:33,199
<i>I can't believe they stored it all in
that shit box of a bank.</i>

131
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,453
<i>The bank is easy
either way, you know?</i>

132
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,800
<i>Even if they don't have any gold,
we could use the cash.</i>

133
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,679
Maybe stick around.
Get some putas.

134
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:43,841
Hey...

135
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,431
We do the job and that's it.

136
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,848
But we hit the bank tonight/
Yeah.

137
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,682
Yeah, cheers.

138
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,665
You make sure the sheriff and his men
don't get in our way.

139
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:14,076
Darko, Baptiste,
you watch our back on Saloon Street.

140
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,878
We don't want no surprises.

141
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,914
Rojo/
Yeah, brother.

142
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:22,755
Come for the gold,
nothing more.

143
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:25,417
Nobody dies,
unless they're asking for it.

144
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,971
Now, I don't want your temper
making heroes out of folks...

145
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,678
that would otherwise
just let it be.

146
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:34,563
Si/ Vamonos.

147
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,569
<i>I was talking with the girls
about it this afternoon.</i>

148
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,142
<i>Yeah, what did they say?</i>

149
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,440
<i>Well, let me get you a strong drink/
Wait, give me a kiss, first.</i>

150
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,325
Love you, baby/
Love you, sweetie.

151
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,495
<i>Smells good.</i>

152
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,493
Evening.

153
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,046
Hey...

154
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,030
Deputies.../
Cheers.

155
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,658
And, Sheriff/
One more.

156
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,530
I told you, it's not...
It's not the stove that's gonna be...

157
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:38,829
You got enough dynamite?

158
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,544
Never enough dynamite.

159
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,805
This is gonna get loud/
Got it, got it.

160
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,502
<i>Get down!/
Calathea!</i>

161
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,169
<i>No need to be a hero, Sheriff!</i>

162
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:30,594
Hey, just stay put.
Boys and I are gonna take care of this.

163
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,180
Just stay inside,
with your little wife!

164
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,426
If anyone tries to come in
through that door that ain't us,

165
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:39,636
you shoot 'em.

166
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,438
Washington,
go get the wagon.

167
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:47,653
Go on!/
All right.

168
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,362
Look at all the gold.

169
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,863
You doubted me?

170
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,113
Nicely done, little brother.

171
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,114
Sheriff, you okay?

172
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,240
Ramos.

173
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:01,366
Save your positions!

174
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:03,868
<i>Hold your fire!</i>

175
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,208
Hold your fire!

176
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:07,003
Jack!

177
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,975
Let's get over to the bank,
we can still save the gold!

178
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,849
I don't care if they get the gold.

179
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,844
You gotta protect the families.

180
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:20,763
I am deputizing you, as of now.

181
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:25,268
You and your boys are to
position yourself behind Saloon Street,

182
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,483
near them houses, okay?
Now, go!

183
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,738
Go get 'em.

184
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,733
Lord protect us.

185
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,276
Okay.

186
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,613
Two... One... Go!

187
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:46,416
Ah, surprise, cabrones!

188
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,592
Fucking bitch!

189
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,006
You wanna play with
the big boys, huh?

190
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,940
Out of bullets.

191
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,526
<i>Keep your eyes open!
Where are they?</i>

192
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:07,854
Baptiste!/
<i>There they are!</i>

193
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,771
<i>Come on, take a shot!</i>

194
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,239
This is the sheriff!

195
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:26,419
Stop where you are
and put your hands up!

196
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:39,804
Put it down!

197
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,888
Didn't I tell you
to stay inside?

198
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,183
Slowly...

199
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,981
If you wanna live.

200
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:57,322
Rojo, vamonos.

201
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,870
Hermano, what's the hurry?

202
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,622
To the victor go the spoils, huh?

203
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,209
What are you talking about?

204
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:08,291
Ow, ah, ah, ah!

205
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:09,921
Okay, okay!

206
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:11,673
Ow, ah!

207
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:13,761
Rojo!/
<i>You're hurting me!</i>

208
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,082
We need to get out of here!/
No!

209
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:16,209
Leave these people alone!

210
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:17,460
Calathea!/
Bob, no!

211
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,180
Calathea!/
Bob!

212
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:20,724
Ah!

213
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,766
No! No!

214
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:26,596
Rojo, what is wrong with you?/
No!

215
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:30,399
What are you doing?
We've got the gold, vamonos!

216
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,772
No!

217
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,855
Maybe I want to stay.

218
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:41,029
And go back to prison?
Federal marshals will be here.

219
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:43,529
Marshals ain't comin', Hermano.

220
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,493
I ain't goin' back to prison.

221
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:51,375
The wagons are loaded.
And we're leaving, now!

222
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:55,338
Brother,
I got a better idea now.

223
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:59,511
I'm gonna stay here
and I'm gonna take over this town.

224
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,184
And you can go to hell.

225
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,237
Put your guns down, boys.

226
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,326
Unless you got something
against bein' rich.

227
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,450
I raised you, Rojo.

228
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:34,046
You're my brother.

229
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:37,968
I'm your half-brother.

230
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:41,678
The only blood we share
is from a whore in Juarez.

231
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,469
Shoot him!

232
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,008
Shoot him!

233
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:52,185
Go ahead.
Pull that iron, boys.

234
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:54,977
You wanna take orders
from a dead man?

235
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:00,611
Or you can take orders from me.

236
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,285
What the fuck is that?

237
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,080
This here's the deed...

238
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,336
The deed that says
that I own the gold mine now.

239
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,953
It was signed over to me.
I'm gonna own it all.

240
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:16,879
Why don't you
read it to 'em, Snake?

241
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,211
Yeah...

242
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,676
Tell 'em how it looks/
Hmm.

243
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:29,926
Looks legit.

244
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:33,645
You think money's
gonna make you a man?

245
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,571
I'm man enough to take
out Guerrero De La Cruz, right?

246
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,817
You're getting soft, brother.

247
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,736
This gang needs a new leader.

248
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:47,154
You been king long enough.

249
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:50,989
Now I'm mayor.

250
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:56,505
I'm sheriff.

251
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:01,084
I'm Jesus H. Christ
in this town.

252
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:06,472
From now on, people will know the
name Red Cavanaugh.

253
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:09,850
You boys are gonna be
the richest goddamned deputies

254
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,679
in the history of law enforcement.

255
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:14,934
There is no honor among you.

256
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,857
Backstabbing traitor.

257
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:23,605
Boys, what do you say we give my
big brother here a nice retirement party?

258
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:27,159
I'll see you again, Rojo.

259
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,033
I'll see all of you.

260
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:41,420
In hell!

261
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:49,194
Gentlemen, there will be men like us

262
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:53,490
who're gonna think...
that they can take this town.

263
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,202
So, the name's gotta remind 'em...

264
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,289
just what's waitin' for 'em
if they try.

265
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:07,300
From now on, the name of this town
is Tombstone.

266
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:54,296
<i>Guerrero.</i>

267
00:24:07,322 --> 00:24:08,697
<i>Guerrero.</i>

268
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:15,698
<i>You're mine.</i>

269
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:38,552
There is never a sound
so sweet as that of the pitiful sufferer.

270
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:46,067
The demon from my dreams,
I've seen you.

271
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:49,101
Oh, I've been waiting for you.

272
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,315
I've been waiting for you.

273
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:56,985
Where am I?

274
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:59,697
Somewhere...

275
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,416
South of heaven.

276
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:04,496
I was shot.

277
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:07,292
Struck down by your
own flesh and blood.

278
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:08,924
I'm dead?

279
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:12,504
I'm dead.

280
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,773
This is hell!

281
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:32,729
I don't belong here!/
Uh, excuse me?

282
00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:34,022
You don't belong here?

283
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,995
That's what they all say.

284
00:25:43,835 --> 00:25:45,958
But you're still of the flesh, hmm?

285
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,751
Until I burn it away.

286
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:58,424
If it's true that men
like me feed the fires of hell,

287
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:06,397
I will bring you more fuel for your fire
than my soul alone could ever supply.

288
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:10,480
Are you trying to
make a deal with me?

289
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:19,901
It's been a pleasure.

290
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:21,739
Wait, wait, wait...
A trade!

291
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:27,038
My soul for the soul of my half-brother
and the cabrones that betrayed me,

292
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:29,204
the Blackwater Gang!

293
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:31,788
Well, that is an
interesting proposition.

294
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,922
One day, 24 hours.

295
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:40,090
What's that,
compared to eternity?

296
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:45,063
I'll give it some thought.

297
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:56,626
<i>One day!
One day, 24 hours!</i>

298
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:58,426
<i>What's that,
compared to eternity?</i>

299
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:03,466
Why should I accept it?
I already have you.

300
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:05,433
They are six. I am one.

301
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:08,093
<i>They are thieves,
killers and traitors,</i>

302
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:11,188
<i>who will sell their own mother
for a sack of gold.</i>

303
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:15,687
<i>Give me just one day
and I'll deliver all six of their souls,</i>

304
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:18,530
<i>including that no good,
lowlife brother of mine,</i>

305
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:20,239
<i>Red Cavanaugh.</i>

306
00:28:20,325 --> 00:28:23,610
<i>You get all six of them,
in exchange for my own soul.</i>

307
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:31,123
<i>Their souls will feed
the fires of hell higher</i>

308
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,452
and give yougreat pleasure,
right now.

309
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:35,376
Hmm.

310
00:28:38,593 --> 00:28:40,751
An intriguing wager.

311
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:54,484
<i>I'll deliver all six of their souls.</i>

312
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,359
<i>Give me just one day.</i>

313
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:00,148
I will grant you one day.

314
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:02,027
One day...

315
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:05,283
But all six men
must die by your hand

316
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,528
and by your hand, alone.

317
00:29:08,373 --> 00:29:09,997
If you succeed,

318
00:29:13,002 --> 00:29:15,125
I will give you
your wretched life.

319
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:17,417
And if you fail,

320
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:21,669
then the misery that
awaits you will be a thousandfold.

321
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:36,891
Do we have a deal?

322
00:29:58,923 --> 00:29:59,954
Whoa!

323
00:30:00,258 --> 00:30:03,045
Nobody touches the tables!

324
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:16,604
One turn of the clock.

325
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,143
Not a second longer.

326
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:28,616
You take your revenge
and deliver my souls.

327
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:37,702
Now you will go
the same way you came.

328
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:19,665
Liza?

329
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:25,126
Why would Sully fix the goddamn clock
and then leave the hole in it?

330
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:26,630
He didn't.

331
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:33,596
Baby, he must've fixed it/
Couldn't have.

332
00:31:36,521 --> 00:31:38,928
Mama, if you're so damn set on keepin'
that pie hole open,

333
00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:40,808
why don't you go upstairs
and take daddy up there

334
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,976
and let me give you
somethin' to do with it?

335
00:31:43,486 --> 00:31:45,313
Come on, bubba, come on, now.

336
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:47,695
<i>Go get her, Red.</i>

337
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,991
It's been one year.

338
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:55,570
It's been one year to the day.

339
00:31:58,126 --> 00:31:59,501
Boo!

340
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:07,168
<i>Did he get scared?</i>

341
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:10,472
<i>Ain't got a Chinaman's
chance of working.</i>

342
00:32:48,676 --> 00:32:49,957
Come on.

343
00:32:50,887 --> 00:32:52,262
Come on.

344
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:21,368
Go put my horse in the barn. Go!/
Yes, sir.

345
00:34:17,765 --> 00:34:18,797
Ah!

346
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:22,011
Puta madre, get out of my sight!/
Yes, sir/  Go!

347
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:27,643
Clean that again/
Yes, sir.

348
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:29,228
Red wants it by dawn.

349
00:34:35,491 --> 00:34:37,235
One year to the day.

350
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:45,160
Impossible.

351
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:49,495
It's completely impossible.

352
00:35:05,438 --> 00:35:07,347
Do you hear that?

353
00:35:15,198 --> 00:35:16,609
What is it, boss?

354
00:35:27,502 --> 00:35:29,245
<i>Ramos.</i>

355
00:35:30,964 --> 00:35:31,995
Huh?

356
00:35:35,635 --> 00:35:37,046
Who's there?

357
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:40,170
Get the pistola.
Come with me.

358
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:54,104
Duke?/
Yeah?

359
00:35:58,032 --> 00:35:59,610
What's going on?

360
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:03,536
Who is there?

361
00:36:11,588 --> 00:36:12,750
Who's there?

362
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:28,054
Hey. Who is it?

363
00:36:33,067 --> 00:36:34,443
What the fuck?

364
00:36:34,527 --> 00:36:35,558
Ah!

365
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:51,036
Who the hell are you?

366
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:56,251
Are you pretty fast
with that pistola?

367
00:36:57,175 --> 00:36:59,251
I don't have to be fast, senor.

368
00:36:59,344 --> 00:37:02,878
Unless you're gonna
shoot me with your pecker. Hmm?

369
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:07,510
I have a pretty nice gun
right here.

370
00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:12,099
There are two people in this world
that know how to put that gun together.

371
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,182
One of them is dead.

372
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:28,486
What the hell?

373
00:37:28,581 --> 00:37:30,159
Now you're talking.

374
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:52,891
You remember me...

375
00:38:39,444 --> 00:38:42,729
The Lord told me
about you in a dream.

376
00:38:44,073 --> 00:38:48,534
Said I'd be... tempted
by a demon from hell.

377
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:57,368
Lord, please, remove this cup from me,
your humble servant.

378
00:38:58,504 --> 00:38:59,536
Amen.

379
00:39:00,548 --> 00:39:02,505
I'm still here, padre.

380
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,302
I'm not a demon.

381
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:08,427
What are you, then?

382
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:12,678
A customer.

383
00:39:16,064 --> 00:39:17,439
A drink...

384
00:39:19,025 --> 00:39:21,314
to soften the revelation.

385
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:26,604
Shit.

386
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:30,362
Mister, if you threaten
the reverend again,

387
00:39:30,453 --> 00:39:33,656
I will shame this holy place
with your blood.

388
00:39:44,008 --> 00:39:45,965
Now, if you two
wanna keep breathing,

389
00:39:46,803 --> 00:39:48,760
you'd better do as I say.

390
00:39:51,516 --> 00:39:53,259
What's your business
here, stranger?

391
00:39:54,018 --> 00:39:56,805
Do you have any pine boxes
in your stores?

392
00:39:57,605 --> 00:40:00,357
Why? Are you an undertaker?

393
00:40:02,402 --> 00:40:03,860
Somethin' like that.

394
00:40:06,197 --> 00:40:07,608
How many do you need?

395
00:40:09,534 --> 00:40:10,565
Six.

396
00:40:35,977 --> 00:40:38,385
God ain't gonna help you, amigo.

397
00:40:38,479 --> 00:40:41,730
Just leave a little silver
in the collection box.

398
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,271
Come on, give me some.

399
00:41:23,733 --> 00:41:25,144
Come on.

400
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:44,249
Viens ici!
Viens!

401
00:41:46,172 --> 00:41:48,497
What is it, boss?/
What is it?

402
00:41:50,301 --> 00:41:52,262
<i>Shooter's probably
around here somewhere.</i>

403
00:41:53,012 --> 00:41:54,044
<i>Probably still here.</i>

404
00:41:58,977 --> 00:42:02,642
Whoever is inside,
get out here now!

405
00:42:06,818 --> 00:42:08,645
<i>Cover me/
Got it.</i>

406
00:42:08,736 --> 00:42:11,488
Get your lollygagging...
Get in there.

407
00:42:11,614 --> 00:42:15,482
Come on, I've got a fistful
of lead for you, right now. Come on.

408
00:42:24,752 --> 00:42:26,081
Come on.
Let's go.

409
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:42,221
Watch it.

410
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,027
Got anything, boys?

411
00:42:59,954 --> 00:43:01,199
No.
Nope.

412
00:43:48,836 --> 00:43:49,868
<i>Let's go.</i>

413
00:45:23,056 --> 00:45:24,764
This is for Ramos.

414
00:45:27,727 --> 00:45:28,925
All that money

415
00:45:30,104 --> 00:45:32,512
and you still can't take a bath.

416
00:45:34,317 --> 00:45:35,895
How do you know my...

417
00:45:36,027 --> 00:45:37,402
Can't be!

418
00:45:39,614 --> 00:45:40,942
It is.

419
00:45:42,617 --> 00:45:43,815
We killed you.

420
00:45:44,577 --> 00:45:48,077
No, this is how you kill someone.

421
00:46:20,989 --> 00:46:23,610
For the great day
of his wrath is come

422
00:46:26,244 --> 00:46:28,118
and who shall be left to stand?

423
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:31,822
Reverend Paul,
you can't go in there.

424
00:46:51,561 --> 00:46:55,808
I have heard tales
of black angels,

425
00:46:56,107 --> 00:46:59,476
come back to destroy
the evils of the Earth.

426
00:47:01,529 --> 00:47:03,901
No soy angel, padre,

427
00:47:04,616 --> 00:47:08,400
but I suggest you leave
till my business is through.

428
00:47:08,995 --> 00:47:10,904
The church is my place.

429
00:47:24,344 --> 00:47:26,467
You... You bleed.

430
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,803
You are of flesh and blood.

431
00:47:31,267 --> 00:47:35,395
You were a part of the Blackwater Gang,
when they took the town.

432
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,691
I watched them bury you.

433
00:47:41,069 --> 00:47:42,693
It's a long story.

434
00:47:43,237 --> 00:47:44,780
And my time is short.

435
00:47:45,198 --> 00:47:46,699
Are you here to kill
Red and his men?

436
00:47:48,409 --> 00:47:50,485
Unless they kill me first.

437
00:47:51,246 --> 00:47:53,653
Well, I don't care if you
are the spawn of hell.

438
00:47:55,708 --> 00:47:56,953
I'll ride with you.

439
00:48:00,546 --> 00:48:02,539
It's personal.

440
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:09,674
Red Cavanaugh murdered
my husband in cold blood.

441
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:12,466
Ain't nothin' more
personal than that.

442
00:48:16,312 --> 00:48:18,768
You can dance on his grave.

443
00:48:19,107 --> 00:48:21,562
But until I'm through,

444
00:48:21,651 --> 00:48:23,394
stay out of my way.

445
00:48:26,155 --> 00:48:28,075
Look, you may be good,
but they've got numbers.

446
00:48:30,076 --> 00:48:32,828
Red hired up a lot of guns
since he took the town.

447
00:48:34,205 --> 00:48:35,747
Let us help.

448
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:38,615
Us?

449
00:48:39,961 --> 00:48:43,246
We've been praying
for someone to bring justice.

450
00:48:43,339 --> 00:48:46,174
Been a year.
Nobody's come.

451
00:48:46,301 --> 00:48:48,174
No marshals,

452
00:48:48,261 --> 00:48:49,969
no law of any kind.

453
00:48:52,098 --> 00:48:54,340
And trust me,
we've sent letters,

454
00:48:54,434 --> 00:48:57,055
telegrams, we even
went to Denver.

455
00:48:58,605 --> 00:49:00,941
Seems like Red's got himself
some friends in high places.

456
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,431
So you see,

457
00:49:06,529 --> 00:49:08,273
we gotta stick together.

458
00:49:08,948 --> 00:49:11,107
You don't hear too good,
do you, lady?

459
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:16,696
Nobody can kill them but me.

460
00:49:19,334 --> 00:49:20,614
Now,

461
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:24,328
I suggest you clear out,
'cause they'll be back sooner or later.

462
00:50:06,422 --> 00:50:08,249
Where the hell is Baptiste?

463
00:50:08,716 --> 00:50:10,673
Was he a part of that
ruckus this morning?

464
00:50:11,594 --> 00:50:13,136
That man loves a fight.

465
00:50:14,514 --> 00:50:15,593
Dead, boss.

466
00:50:19,894 --> 00:50:21,175
Ramos, too.

467
00:50:24,607 --> 00:50:26,232
What the hell are you talking about?

468
00:50:28,027 --> 00:50:29,901
I seen 'em boxed up.

469
00:50:38,204 --> 00:50:39,663
All right, boys.

470
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:42,698
Let's go pay our respects, huh?

471
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:46,832
Come on.
Come on.

472
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,948
Whiskey.

473
00:52:07,043 --> 00:52:08,122
You from around here?

474
00:52:09,963 --> 00:52:11,457
Not exactly.

475
00:52:16,386 --> 00:52:18,305
Can I help you with somethin'?/
Leave the bottle.

476
00:52:18,554 --> 00:52:19,965
Yes, sir.

477
00:52:20,348 --> 00:52:21,972
Well, you know what they say,

478
00:52:22,308 --> 00:52:23,768
"If you're looking for someone..."

479
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,643
"Just head to the saloon."

480
00:52:32,443 --> 00:52:35,314
Expect it'll be getting
lively around here in a while.

481
00:52:45,707 --> 00:52:47,331
Who're the empty ones for?

482
00:52:48,793 --> 00:52:49,908
Are you fucking stupid?

483
00:52:56,718 --> 00:52:58,176
Son of a bitch!

484
00:52:59,345 --> 00:53:00,839
We can't just let them rot.

485
00:53:01,431 --> 00:53:02,889
Ain't good for business.

486
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:06,805
No.

487
00:53:06,894 --> 00:53:08,437
That's exactly what
we're gonna do.

488
00:53:12,066 --> 00:53:14,023
We're gonna kill this man tonight.

489
00:53:15,111 --> 00:53:17,020
I don't give a shit who's with him.

490
00:53:18,364 --> 00:53:19,562
Listen better,

491
00:53:20,241 --> 00:53:23,527
if you boys fuck this up, I'm gonna
put you in these caskets myself.

492
00:53:24,412 --> 00:53:25,740
Who you think did it?

493
00:53:28,124 --> 00:53:29,915
Who gives a shit?

494
00:53:31,044 --> 00:53:32,835
He's a dead man.

495
00:53:36,966 --> 00:53:38,164
Washington,

496
00:53:40,637 --> 00:53:42,676
get up to the mine
and crack the whip,

497
00:53:43,932 --> 00:53:47,217
we got a delivery tonight
come hell or high water,

498
00:53:49,187 --> 00:53:50,895
and we better be even, boy.

499
00:53:52,982 --> 00:53:54,524
All right.

500
00:53:56,986 --> 00:53:58,730
We're gonna get payback.

501
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:06,030
Shut the fuck up.

502
00:54:31,062 --> 00:54:32,177
Hey.

503
00:54:32,522 --> 00:54:34,645
What the hell are you doing here?

504
00:54:34,732 --> 00:54:36,808
You know, I always
loved that expression.

505
00:54:37,986 --> 00:54:39,528
I still had time.

506
00:54:39,654 --> 00:54:40,733
Hmm...

507
00:54:42,573 --> 00:54:44,158
Oh, brother, let me tell you
something.

508
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:46,988
Time is half gone.
Yet your quarry is still half alive.

509
00:54:47,787 --> 00:54:49,780
Yeah, I'm wasting it talking to you.

510
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:53,785
Listen, hombre,

511
00:54:55,378 --> 00:54:57,454
I want that little maricon.

512
00:54:58,923 --> 00:55:01,710
I want that Red Cavanaugh's ass
and I want it now.

513
00:55:01,801 --> 00:55:03,877
I want his blood
and you're gonna bring it to me.

514
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:11,555
Now, I don't want nothing...

515
00:55:11,644 --> 00:55:14,978
Not a goddamn thing
to distract you, okay?

516
00:55:15,607 --> 00:55:20,268
None of your pussy, none of your whores,
none of all these preacher friends, all these...

517
00:55:20,361 --> 00:55:23,448
All these fuckers that are gonna be
talkin' about all this righteous shit...

518
00:55:23,489 --> 00:55:25,815
"His goodness"
and all that, you know?

519
00:55:27,785 --> 00:55:30,027
I know you better
than you know yourself

520
00:55:30,121 --> 00:55:31,781
and I can smell your conscience.

521
00:55:31,873 --> 00:55:33,664
Makes me wanna puke.

522
00:55:37,045 --> 00:55:38,076
Ah!

523
00:55:41,549 --> 00:55:43,209
Jesus Christ.

524
00:55:44,844 --> 00:55:47,169
Hey, hey, hombre.

525
00:55:47,847 --> 00:55:50,634
Hey, I'm watching everything.

526
00:55:50,975 --> 00:55:53,098
Everything, okay?

527
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:57,058
Can't pull the wool
over my eyes, boy.

528
00:55:59,817 --> 00:56:02,522
Never forget why
I brought you here.

529
00:56:07,867 --> 00:56:09,575
High noon, hombre.

530
00:56:19,754 --> 00:56:21,794
Right up to the saloon, boys.

531
00:56:22,882 --> 00:56:24,376
Come on, move it.

532
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:29,426
You better be right
about this, son.

533
00:56:30,223 --> 00:56:32,346
Get out! Move out!

534
00:56:32,433 --> 00:56:34,556
Move out. Put them up.

535
00:56:42,068 --> 00:56:43,099
Shh...

536
00:57:45,757 --> 00:57:48,923
I don't know who you
think you are, stranger,

537
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:52,758
but if you've come to my town,
lookin' for trouble?

538
00:57:53,765 --> 00:57:55,093
You just found plenty.

539
00:57:56,684 --> 00:57:58,309
It's been a while, huh, Rojo?

540
00:58:03,608 --> 00:58:06,181
Only one man's ever called me that.

541
00:58:08,529 --> 00:58:10,024
And he's dead and buried.

542
00:58:22,669 --> 00:58:26,287
Some things don't
stay buried, Rojo.

543
00:58:27,215 --> 00:58:28,839
My brother is dead.

544
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:32,382
I seen the blood drain out of him,

545
00:58:33,930 --> 00:58:36,136
when I put the bullet in his heart.

546
00:58:38,184 --> 00:58:40,058
I killed you once.

547
00:58:41,104 --> 00:58:42,135
Never again.

548
00:59:51,382 --> 00:59:53,174
We don't have to do this, brother.

549
00:59:53,259 --> 00:59:55,548
There's plenty of gold
to go round.

550
00:59:56,763 --> 00:59:58,305
I prefer lead.

551
00:59:59,265 --> 01:00:00,973
I'll tell you what,

552
01:00:01,059 --> 01:00:02,434
come on out...

553
01:00:02,894 --> 01:00:04,768
and I'll cut you in
on your fair share.

554
01:00:05,355 --> 01:00:07,264
We'd be square. Deal?

555
01:00:07,941 --> 01:00:10,728
I already made a deal.
All I gotta do now is collect.

556
01:00:12,195 --> 01:00:13,226
Take him down!

557
01:00:33,508 --> 01:00:34,539
<i>Take him down!</i>

558
01:00:35,969 --> 01:00:37,677
<i>I'll take him down.</i>

559
01:00:55,446 --> 01:00:57,772
I ain't gonna miss the next one.

560
01:00:57,865 --> 01:01:00,154
Just wanted you to know
who killed you.

561
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:06,071
Are you out of your mind, woman?

562
01:01:06,207 --> 01:01:07,666
You're goddamn right.

563
01:01:12,046 --> 01:01:14,086
You with my brother?/
Not exactly.

564
01:01:14,382 --> 01:01:16,588
But he is my inspiration.

565
01:01:23,182 --> 01:01:24,463
You killed my husband...

566
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:25,590
Huh?

567
01:01:28,855 --> 01:01:31,346
...and now you're gonna die
for your sins.

568
01:01:31,441 --> 01:01:32,603
No!

569
01:01:56,716 --> 01:02:00,583
<i>The law man's wench,
she will be the end of you.</i>

570
01:02:01,054 --> 01:02:02,845
<i>So stay sharp, Guerrero.</i>

571
01:02:16,611 --> 01:02:18,022
This is the work of the devil.

572
01:02:21,783 --> 01:02:23,775
Son of a bitch.

573
01:02:27,830 --> 01:02:29,206
Why did you let Red go?

574
01:02:29,582 --> 01:02:31,076
I had him dead to rights.

575
01:02:33,127 --> 01:02:34,408
I have to kill him.

576
01:02:34,879 --> 01:02:36,160
Why?

577
01:02:37,006 --> 01:02:41,300
Mister, after what we just witnessed,
there ain't no tale too tall that can explain it.

578
01:02:42,178 --> 01:02:44,135
It's my only escape
from damnation.

579
01:02:44,973 --> 01:02:47,380
Deliver the souls of Red
and the Blackwater Gang

580
01:02:47,475 --> 01:02:50,310
to the devil...
to save mine.

581
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,107
And I have to kill him myself,

582
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:01,396
and I have till midnight to do it.

583
01:03:03,574 --> 01:03:04,985
Well, maybe you have to kill them,

584
01:03:06,703 --> 01:03:09,075
but I got a dog in this fight,

585
01:03:09,163 --> 01:03:11,239
and there ain't nothin'
that says I can't help.

586
01:03:12,792 --> 01:03:15,200
You're casting your
lot in with a killer

587
01:03:15,295 --> 01:03:17,702
knowing full well
that the devil is his keeper?

588
01:03:17,797 --> 01:03:19,632
This is about justice
being served, Reverend.

589
01:03:20,091 --> 01:03:21,882
I don't care who's serving it.

590
01:03:25,096 --> 01:03:27,552
Your soul is at
stake here, young lady.

591
01:03:28,141 --> 01:03:32,470
Reverend, the fires of hell
are a Sunday picnic compared to my pain.

592
01:03:40,069 --> 01:03:42,192
Come on.
I wanna show you something.

593
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:57,545
You're stronger than you look.

594
01:03:58,212 --> 01:03:59,956
I had some help/
Cal.

595
01:04:00,048 --> 01:04:01,874
Reverend Paul...

596
01:04:03,176 --> 01:04:05,881
We spotted Red Cavanaugh
on our way into town.

597
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:07,879
Headed to the mines,
more than likely.

598
01:04:08,389 --> 01:04:11,059
We'd like you to know
we're here to help.

599
01:04:11,142 --> 01:04:15,140
Please, Jack. There are eternal
consequences to your actions.

600
01:04:15,271 --> 01:04:16,979
Lest we be damned.

601
01:04:18,191 --> 01:04:19,353
Give this town back to us

602
01:04:19,442 --> 01:04:22,063
and you'll have the rest of your life
to atone for the sins

603
01:04:22,153 --> 01:04:24,146
of the life that
you left behind.

604
01:04:26,574 --> 01:04:28,199
Defend yourselves.

605
01:04:29,577 --> 01:04:30,953
Protect your town.

606
01:04:31,871 --> 01:04:35,205
But any of the Blackwater boys,
you leave to me.

607
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:44,751
Show me the way to the mines.

608
01:05:22,088 --> 01:05:24,211
<i>All right,
all right, all right.</i>

609
01:05:25,466 --> 01:05:27,210
How we doing down here, boys?

610
01:05:28,011 --> 01:05:29,671
I don't think we can hit 100.

611
01:05:29,762 --> 01:05:31,636
No, you gotta get to 200,
Washington,

612
01:05:31,889 --> 01:05:34,178
or you're gonna have
a large-size problem here.

613
01:05:36,853 --> 01:05:38,596
All right, everybody listen up,

614
01:05:39,856 --> 01:05:42,525
we're three months
behind on deliveries

615
01:05:42,650 --> 01:05:44,275
and he's coming to collect.

616
01:05:44,652 --> 01:05:47,737
He can help us hack it out
of the goddamned walls if he wants.

617
01:05:47,822 --> 01:05:49,779
We have nothing to hide.

618
01:05:49,866 --> 01:05:52,653
Washington, he's the least
of our problems at this point.

619
01:05:54,078 --> 01:05:56,071
You tellin' me
the stranger's still breathin'?

620
01:05:56,998 --> 01:05:59,833
Yeah, what I'm telling you
is he ain't no damn stranger.

621
01:06:01,753 --> 01:06:02,998
Who is he?

622
01:06:04,464 --> 01:06:05,495
He's my brother.

623
01:06:07,175 --> 01:06:08,503
Yeah, right.

624
01:06:11,804 --> 01:06:13,596
Close your mouth,
you're drawing flies.

625
01:06:17,310 --> 01:06:18,895
<i>Someone's coming up the road.</i>

626
01:06:22,023 --> 01:06:23,398
You better identify yourselves.

627
01:06:25,777 --> 01:06:27,520
You've got three seconds.

628
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:30,190
One,

629
01:06:30,615 --> 01:06:31,646
two,

630
01:06:32,033 --> 01:06:33,064
three.

631
01:06:43,711 --> 01:06:44,743
All right, he's here.

632
01:06:46,381 --> 01:06:48,254
All right. Let's go, guys.
Grab your pistols.

633
01:06:48,341 --> 01:06:49,669
Let's go, boys.
Let's move.

634
01:06:51,928 --> 01:06:53,802
Come on, fall in.

635
01:06:54,430 --> 01:06:57,100
Time to kill my brother.
Again.

636
01:07:25,587 --> 01:07:28,124
Back up. Back the fuck up
or I'll kill you.

637
01:07:28,881 --> 01:07:29,961
Back up.

638
01:07:36,306 --> 01:07:37,930
Now what's all this then?

639
01:07:38,558 --> 01:07:40,597
Are we having
a spot of trouble?

640
01:07:42,228 --> 01:07:43,391
Judah Clark?

641
01:07:43,479 --> 01:07:45,022
And you brought marshals.
Thank God.

642
01:07:45,106 --> 01:07:46,441
No, thank me/
Get down!

643
01:07:50,945 --> 01:07:52,321
Hello, Cal.

644
01:07:53,114 --> 01:07:54,145
Yes,

645
01:07:55,074 --> 01:07:57,744
I think you should stay
down until all this gets sorted out.

646
01:07:58,453 --> 01:08:01,370
Hey, limey!
I just came for Red.

647
01:08:01,456 --> 01:08:03,375
Why don't you come and get your boy?/
Red,

648
01:08:03,791 --> 01:08:07,042
is this the fellow that's been putting
your men on display at the chapel?

649
01:08:07,128 --> 01:08:09,619
Yeah, but me and the boys
are taking care of it, obviously.

650
01:08:09,714 --> 01:08:12,917
Really? Because just
the opposite appears to be the case.

651
01:08:13,009 --> 01:08:15,582
I pay you to run this operation and keep
our interests secure,

652
01:08:15,678 --> 01:08:17,805
which clearly they are not.
Which begs the question,

653
01:08:17,972 --> 01:08:19,632
where's my gold?

654
01:08:19,807 --> 01:08:21,218
Oh, you're gonna get it, Judah.

655
01:08:21,309 --> 01:08:22,554
You're gonna get it.

656
01:08:22,644 --> 01:08:24,138
You're the one protecting him?

657
01:08:24,854 --> 01:08:27,606
The federal courts were going
to let the mining rights revert to Edendale.

658
01:08:27,690 --> 01:08:30,264
So if I wanted control of the mine,

659
01:08:30,652 --> 01:08:32,478
I simply needed
control of the town.

660
01:08:32,904 --> 01:08:35,905
Mr. Cavanaugh here
provides that control.

661
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:37,983
And I...

662
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:40,535
I pay off all the right people.

663
01:08:41,829 --> 01:08:43,074
So,

664
01:08:43,164 --> 01:08:45,655
if I don't see every
ounce of my gold,

665
01:08:46,042 --> 01:08:47,702
I'll take my men

666
01:08:47,794 --> 01:08:50,285
and leave you in the predicament
in which I found you.

667
01:08:50,838 --> 01:08:52,001
Snake,

668
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:53,997
come on down here.

669
01:08:55,593 --> 01:08:56,624
It's here.

670
01:08:57,178 --> 01:08:58,803
It's here.

671
01:09:05,436 --> 01:09:09,897
Well, gentlemen, we seem to finally have
got our accounts in order.

672
01:09:09,983 --> 01:09:12,652
Red, my apologies.

673
01:09:12,735 --> 01:09:14,811
Please allow me to
take care of this for you.

674
01:09:15,238 --> 01:09:16,352
Kill them both.

675
01:09:28,835 --> 01:09:30,246
Fire!

676
01:09:43,641 --> 01:09:45,052
Hold on a second.

677
01:09:50,732 --> 01:09:53,602
Bob, Jim, check it out.

678
01:10:28,269 --> 01:10:29,929
I guess you get what you pay for.

679
01:10:31,272 --> 01:10:32,648
Can I?

680
01:10:33,775 --> 01:10:34,806
Hell, no.

681
01:10:35,777 --> 01:10:38,184
We got good equipment
down there.

682
01:10:40,323 --> 01:10:41,817
Do better.

683
01:11:15,817 --> 01:11:16,848
Fuck!

684
01:11:36,004 --> 01:11:37,035
Do it.

685
01:11:38,381 --> 01:11:40,290
About time.

686
01:11:53,021 --> 01:11:54,847
Let's see you get out of that.

687
01:12:23,593 --> 01:12:24,838
Let them rot in there.

688
01:12:24,928 --> 01:12:26,470
Washington?

689
01:12:35,855 --> 01:12:36,886
Let's go, come on.

690
01:12:38,733 --> 01:12:41,058
There's only five hours left.
We need to hurry.

691
01:13:20,275 --> 01:13:21,769
What are you doing?

692
01:13:23,236 --> 01:13:24,695
A cigar?

693
01:13:28,324 --> 01:13:29,700
Only way I'll get rid of them.

694
01:14:00,189 --> 01:14:01,221
That's it!

695
01:14:01,983 --> 01:14:03,976
We're almost back in town.

696
01:14:12,327 --> 01:14:13,358
Okay, keep it steady.

697
01:15:13,471 --> 01:15:14,502
Yah!

698
01:15:19,227 --> 01:15:20,425
Cut him off!

699
01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:44,741
Dynamite!

700
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:56,461
Ah!

701
01:16:08,109 --> 01:16:09,272
Oh, oh, oh!

702
01:16:11,446 --> 01:16:12,477
No!/
Come on!

703
01:16:12,572 --> 01:16:13,603
No!

704
01:16:13,948 --> 01:16:15,027
Yah!

705
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:16,992
Come on and get me!

706
01:16:17,076 --> 01:16:18,274
Guerrero!

707
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:34,791
Come here.

708
01:16:35,762 --> 01:16:36,793
Let her go, Red.

709
01:16:36,888 --> 01:16:38,596
You want this?
You want this, huh?

710
01:16:46,814 --> 01:16:47,894
Come and get me.

711
01:16:49,275 --> 01:16:50,354
Come and get me!

712
01:16:55,448 --> 01:16:57,773
Ah!

713
01:16:57,867 --> 01:16:59,278
Hold on!

714
01:17:06,167 --> 01:17:07,198
I'm coming for you, Red.

715
01:17:08,795 --> 01:17:09,826
Get up.

716
01:17:10,672 --> 01:17:11,751
Move it.

717
01:17:33,111 --> 01:17:34,391
Cover me!

718
01:17:41,202 --> 01:17:42,780
Hey, boss,

719
01:17:42,870 --> 01:17:45,824
okay if I still call you that?

720
01:17:46,165 --> 01:17:47,708
I got the girl.

721
01:17:48,710 --> 01:17:49,741
She's a pretty one.

722
01:17:51,546 --> 01:17:52,839
I'm gonna have to kill her now.

723
01:17:53,381 --> 01:17:54,875
Unless you come on out.

724
01:17:55,717 --> 01:17:57,175
Girl's dead either way.

725
01:17:58,177 --> 01:18:01,878
If I come out
and somebody kills me,

726
01:18:02,890 --> 01:18:04,550
who's gonna kill you?

727
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:09,060
He ain't coming back for you.

728
01:18:13,401 --> 01:18:19,190
He doesn't give a shit about you
or your town.

729
01:18:20,617 --> 01:18:21,992
Yeah.

730
01:18:23,286 --> 01:18:24,448
I assure you.

731
01:18:29,626 --> 01:18:31,784
I won't kill her if you
give yourself up.

732
01:18:33,296 --> 01:18:36,131
I'll kill you for certain.

733
01:18:37,133 --> 01:18:38,331
But I swear,

734
01:18:39,469 --> 01:18:41,508
I won't kill her.

735
01:18:41,804 --> 01:18:43,714
And you know I'm good for it.

736
01:18:44,098 --> 01:18:47,218
You'd even laugh about that,
remember?

737
01:18:48,478 --> 01:18:51,811
A man that's good for his word
with a name like Snake.

738
01:18:52,982 --> 01:18:55,141
You even had a word for it.

739
01:18:56,736 --> 01:18:58,479
What was it?

740
01:19:00,156 --> 01:19:01,187
Irony.

741
01:19:07,163 --> 01:19:08,705
<i>Snake eyes.</i>

742
01:19:09,499 --> 01:19:12,665
And now it looks like it's your turn
to roll the bones, shooter.

743
01:19:13,962 --> 01:19:15,420
We want our town back!

744
01:19:23,721 --> 01:19:25,132
<i>Payback time!</i>

745
01:19:28,059 --> 01:19:29,767
<i>We want revenge!</i>

746
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:35,472
Move up!

747
01:19:36,943 --> 01:19:38,437
Move up! Come on!

748
01:19:39,237 --> 01:19:40,316
You stay here.

749
01:19:42,448 --> 01:19:43,729
All right.

750
01:19:44,826 --> 01:19:46,902
But I'm afraid the odds
favor the house.

751
01:20:42,550 --> 01:20:43,581
Ah!

752
01:20:56,606 --> 01:20:58,480
Your priority was simple,

753
01:21:00,193 --> 01:21:01,770
even if the task was not.

754
01:21:02,862 --> 01:21:06,397
The law man's wench,
she's a distraction.

755
01:21:07,283 --> 01:21:10,035
And you could have done it
if you weren't such a pathetic coward.

756
01:21:10,119 --> 01:21:12,112
I don't regret what I did.

757
01:21:13,289 --> 01:21:14,831
I don't give a fuck.

758
01:21:17,043 --> 01:21:18,241
It matters to me.

759
01:21:21,589 --> 01:21:24,460
Let's cross that bridge
when the time comes.

760
01:21:43,569 --> 01:21:44,945
Honey...

761
01:21:49,325 --> 01:21:51,401
Oh, yee-haw.

762
01:21:55,164 --> 01:21:58,415
Must be real lonely
being a widow and all, huh?

763
01:21:58,543 --> 01:21:59,574
Huh?

764
01:22:14,267 --> 01:22:15,595
We can do this the hard way

765
01:22:15,685 --> 01:22:17,179
if you want.

766
01:22:17,854 --> 01:22:20,012
I always did like breakin' ponies.

767
01:22:20,898 --> 01:22:23,105
You're gonna have to kill me

768
01:22:23,901 --> 01:22:29,488
and conjugate your
putrid fantasy with my corpse,

769
01:22:30,408 --> 01:22:32,401
you horse's ass.

770
01:22:36,873 --> 01:22:38,118
Why don't you untie me?

771
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:41,374
Why don't you come fight
me like a real man?

772
01:22:43,046 --> 01:22:45,537
<i>Red, come down here!</i>

773
01:22:46,507 --> 01:22:48,417
Hold on, now.

774
01:22:49,469 --> 01:22:51,138
I got a little bit
of business to square.

775
01:22:51,930 --> 01:22:54,171
Then I'm gonna be back up
here with spurs on.

776
01:22:55,391 --> 01:22:56,850
Boys?

777
01:22:57,602 --> 01:23:00,271
Tie her back up
and do not fuck it up this time.

778
01:23:00,355 --> 01:23:01,386
Got it, boss.

779
01:23:01,481 --> 01:23:03,972
If you boys are good,
I'll give you a shot after mine, right?

780
01:23:05,485 --> 01:23:06,516
No!

781
01:23:13,034 --> 01:23:14,576
I should like to
propose a toast.

782
01:23:14,953 --> 01:23:17,159
To an excellent partnership.

783
01:23:18,248 --> 01:23:19,279
I'll drink to that.

784
01:23:20,625 --> 01:23:23,246
You're looking a little
the worse for wear, Red.

785
01:23:24,712 --> 01:23:27,797
Have you finally got
Tombstone under control?

786
01:23:29,592 --> 01:23:31,170
Never was out of control.

787
01:23:33,137 --> 01:23:34,762
<i>I lost some men,</i>

788
01:23:34,847 --> 01:23:36,757
<i>won't be the first time,</i>

789
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:39,306
and sure as shit
won't be the last.

790
01:23:39,811 --> 01:23:41,554
<i>Red Cavanaugh?</i>

791
01:23:42,313 --> 01:23:43,689
Judah Clark?

792
01:23:43,773 --> 01:23:44,804
Where are you?

793
01:23:47,944 --> 01:23:49,237
Is this your idea of control...

794
01:23:49,279 --> 01:23:51,105
Shut your fucking mouth.

795
01:23:52,740 --> 01:23:54,448
Look outside, Judah Clark.

796
01:23:55,451 --> 01:23:57,278
The folk that you betrayed.

797
01:23:57,579 --> 01:23:59,370
Easy, Jack.

798
01:23:59,747 --> 01:24:02,832
I'm sure we can settle
this like civilized men.

799
01:24:03,293 --> 01:24:04,703
Your greed...

800
01:24:04,794 --> 01:24:06,703
Greed of both of you mongrels

801
01:24:06,796 --> 01:24:08,623
brought all the evil on this town.

802
01:24:09,132 --> 01:24:10,163
Here's where it ends.

803
01:24:11,843 --> 01:24:13,551
Please, Jack.

804
01:24:13,636 --> 01:24:15,961
Don't mix me in
with these heathens.

805
01:24:16,514 --> 01:24:18,341
I'm just a man of business.

806
01:24:18,766 --> 01:24:20,676
Heathens, huh?

807
01:24:21,311 --> 01:24:22,721
Heathens?

808
01:24:23,354 --> 01:24:24,932
Don't fucking move, boy.

809
01:24:26,816 --> 01:24:28,725
You think I'm fucking
around with you, boy?

810
01:24:29,819 --> 01:24:32,144
Looks like this business is closed.

811
01:24:43,541 --> 01:24:44,834
Come on, I need you now, bitch.

812
01:24:44,876 --> 01:24:45,907
Let's go/ Where?

813
01:24:46,002 --> 01:24:47,995
Let's go, princess!
I need you out.

814
01:24:48,755 --> 01:24:53,167
Come on, get up.
Let's go. Get!

815
01:25:01,601 --> 01:25:06,892
If it is your desire to
pay penance for your despicable life,

816
01:25:07,398 --> 01:25:09,190
brother, let me tell you,

817
01:25:09,317 --> 01:25:11,025
you will pay dearly.

818
01:25:14,989 --> 01:25:17,148
Your debt to me remains unpaid.

819
01:25:18,117 --> 01:25:20,324
But this wager amuses me.

820
01:25:23,331 --> 01:25:25,122
You have one hour.

821
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:26,875
One hour.

822
01:26:08,876 --> 01:26:11,249
Back up, boy,
back up, right now!

823
01:26:11,379 --> 01:26:13,122
I gave you all life
in this goddamn town.

824
01:26:13,423 --> 01:26:15,380
Back up! Back up!

825
01:26:15,466 --> 01:26:17,044
I told you to back up!

826
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:19,836
Stop right there,
Red Cavanaugh.

827
01:26:19,929 --> 01:26:21,092
You ain't going no place.

828
01:26:21,222 --> 01:26:23,630
I made this town.
I put money in all your pockets!

829
01:26:23,725 --> 01:26:26,429
I made you all rich!
Now get the fuck off me!

830
01:26:27,312 --> 01:26:28,936
I own all of you.

831
01:26:30,273 --> 01:26:32,431
<i>Nice night for hanging, Red.</i>

832
01:26:59,677 --> 01:27:01,302
<i>You're going straight to hell.</i>

833
01:27:01,387 --> 01:27:02,514
Now you're a hero, huh?

834
01:27:04,515 --> 01:27:05,796
Is that it?

835
01:27:06,517 --> 01:27:07,549
No, Rojo,

836
01:27:08,186 --> 01:27:10,143
not a hero.

837
01:27:10,688 --> 01:27:12,645
Just an outlaw, like you.

838
01:27:14,108 --> 01:27:15,852
Let's get this settled...

839
01:27:16,277 --> 01:27:17,937
once and for all.

840
01:27:18,738 --> 01:27:20,481
Stop hiding behind the girl.

841
01:27:21,032 --> 01:27:22,775
Let her go.

842
01:27:24,786 --> 01:27:30,575
And we'll let the good people of Edendale
make sure it's a fair fight this time.

843
01:27:33,836 --> 01:27:35,331
Put it down, Jack.

844
01:27:35,713 --> 01:27:37,124
Put it down.

845
01:27:44,013 --> 01:27:49,684
You once said you had huevos
big enough to take out Guerrero De La Cruz.

846
01:27:50,979 --> 01:27:54,430
You don't, hermanito,

847
01:27:54,524 --> 01:27:56,766
and you never will.

848
01:27:57,777 --> 01:27:59,319
There's one box left...

849
01:28:01,281 --> 01:28:02,775
and it's for you.

850
01:28:29,726 --> 01:28:31,718
You just called
your mother a whore.

851
01:29:13,853 --> 01:29:15,104
All right, Guerrero,

852
01:29:15,396 --> 01:29:17,056
only two minutes left.

853
01:30:23,673 --> 01:30:24,704
Why?

854
01:30:27,468 --> 01:30:28,500
Guerrero!

855
01:30:28,845 --> 01:30:29,876
Ah!

856
01:30:47,030 --> 01:30:48,949
You think I'm fucking
around with you, brother?

857
01:30:51,534 --> 01:30:53,527
This time, stay dead.

858
01:31:33,201 --> 01:31:35,692
Tell Mama I died like a man.

859
01:31:50,551 --> 01:31:53,256
Guerrero,
you're mine.

860
01:32:02,605 --> 01:32:05,808
Guerrero is my soul.

861
01:32:41,352 --> 01:32:42,763
It's two minutes after.

862
01:33:05,251 --> 01:33:06,995
I really wanna thank you.

863
01:33:08,838 --> 01:33:09,917
Thank you.

864
01:34:06,437 --> 01:34:08,062
Oh, boy.

865
01:34:08,147 --> 01:34:09,939
You got what you wanted.

866
01:34:10,024 --> 01:34:11,851
Now leave me alone.

867
01:34:14,112 --> 01:34:19,023
Hey, listen, Red Cavanaugh expired
two minutes past midnight.

868
01:34:19,951 --> 01:34:21,742
You failed.

869
01:34:22,453 --> 01:34:25,454
And you of all people
should know what the fuck I want.

870
01:34:26,165 --> 01:34:27,957
There is no end to
what I want, brother.

871
01:34:28,918 --> 01:34:30,994
Then why am I still
above ground?

872
01:34:31,588 --> 01:34:35,288
Well, let's look at it this way,
I have come to enjoy your partnership.

873
01:34:37,927 --> 01:34:39,635
What can I say?

874
01:34:40,263 --> 01:34:43,133
I gorge myself on
the souls of evil men,

875
01:34:43,266 --> 01:34:45,721
and you breathe the air of life.

876
01:34:45,810 --> 01:34:47,270
When will my debt be paid?

877
01:34:48,938 --> 01:34:52,105
Well, when every last
fucking outlaw is dead, huh?

878
01:34:52,191 --> 01:34:53,520
How does that sound?

879
01:34:54,736 --> 01:34:56,278
This is the West.

880
01:34:56,904 --> 01:34:59,230
There's no shortage of bad guys.

881
01:34:59,741 --> 01:35:01,650
What can I say, partner?

882
01:35:03,036 --> 01:35:05,242
You're my devil's outlaw.

883
01:35:52,752 --> 01:35:55,325
They say God made man
in his own image.

884
01:35:56,464 --> 01:35:59,833
Unfortunately, you were
made in mine.

885
01:36:05,014 --> 01:36:06,425
Guerrero!

886
01:36:07,433 --> 01:36:08,714
Guerrero!

887
01:36:10,937 --> 01:36:12,929
<i>Guerrero!</i>
