1
00:02:30,749 --> 00:02:31,995
You in the robes.

2
00:02:31,996 --> 00:02:33,818
Put down the weapon of mass destruction

3
00:02:33,818 --> 00:02:35,160
and get on the ground!

4
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:38,997
You are under arrest.

5
00:02:48,589 --> 00:02:51,923
Put down your weapons now!

6
00:02:51,987 --> 00:02:54,018
Why can't we ever do this the easy way?

7
00:03:03,455 --> 00:03:07,291
World Police. Get down on the ground!

8
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,457
Hey terrorist.

9
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:21,294
Terrorize this.

10
00:03:30,214 --> 00:03:34,050
All right. Let's make this interesting.

11
00:03:59,275 --> 00:04:03,111
You lose.

12
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,732
He is getting away with the WMD.

13
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:09,442
I got him.

14
00:04:17,307 --> 00:04:19,225
Damn, I missed him.

15
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:20,184
Sarah, he has got the bomb.

16
00:04:20,184 --> 00:04:23,636
You got a fix?

17
00:04:23,284 --> 00:04:24,500
I got him Carson.

18
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,760
He is heading for Louvre.

19
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:31,597
Your plans are over.

20
00:04:40,517 --> 00:04:43,106
All right Sarah.

21
00:04:43,107 --> 00:04:45,312
Nothing to it.

22
00:04:45,313 --> 00:04:48,669
All right. Let's make this interesting.

23
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,067
Bonjour everyone. Don't worry!

24
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:53,081
Everything is bombed

25
00:04:53,082 --> 00:04:56,918
We stopped the terrorists.

26
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:08,140
I was doing a lot of thinking on the ride over here.

27
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,995
Oh yeah? Bout what?

28
00:05:10,029 --> 00:05:13,959
I was thinking that I want you to marry me.

29
00:05:13,961 --> 00:05:14,833
Don't joke about that!

30
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,888
Who's joking?

31
00:05:20,608 --> 00:05:23,389
Joe to Sarah.
Looks like we may need to order up a wedding cake.

32
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,116
He finally popped the question?

33
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,226
Lisa you are an amazing woman ...

34
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:29,623
and a damn fine cop.

35
00:05:29,624 --> 00:05:32,501
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

36
00:05:32,501 --> 00:05:36,337
Oh Carson, Carson.

37
00:05:36,913 --> 00:05:40,749
Carson!

38
00:05:44,202 --> 00:05:48,038
No!

39
00:05:51,204 --> 00:05:52,930
Carson!

40
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,519
Feel so cold.

41
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,013
You have to hang on Carson.

42
00:05:58,014 --> 00:06:01,562
Sorry babe. Looks like this was a one-way ticket.

43
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:04,535
No!

44
00:06:04,536 --> 00:06:08,276
Lisa you have to live on,
Find someone else who will love you.

45
00:06:08,276 --> 00:06:10,290
Find someone else and be happy.

46
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:14,126
You deserve it.

47
00:06:16,525 --> 00:06:20,361
No!!!! No !!!!

48
00:06:20,937 --> 00:06:24,773
No !!!!

49
00:06:45,394 --> 00:06:48,559
# Everyone has AIDS #

50
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:54,121
# AIDS, AIDS, AIDS #

51
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:57,958
# Everyone has AIDS #

52
00:06:58,211 --> 00:07:01,315
# And so this is the end of our story #

53
00:07:01,315 --> 00:07:04,288
# And everyone is dead from AIDS #

54
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:08,125
# It took from me my best friend my only true pal #

55
00:07:09,851 --> 00:07:11,769
# My only bright star #

00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,400

# Well I am going to march on Washington '

# lead the fight and charge the brigades #

00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:20,415
# There is a hero inside of all of us #

60
00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:23,350
# I will make them see that everyone has AIDS #

61

65
00:07:32,777 --> 00:07:34,404
# Everyone has AIDS #

70
00:07:44,384 --> 00:07:47,064
# Everyone has AIDS, AIDS, AIDS #

71
00:07:47,065 --> 00:07:52,819
# AIDS, AIDS, AIDS #

72
00:08:00,109 --> 00:08:01,643
Great job Gary.

73
00:08:01,644 --> 00:08:02,794
Thanks, you too Steve.

74
00:08:02,795 --> 00:08:04,617
That was the greatest acting I have ever seen.

75
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,247
I just don't know how do you do it Gary?

76
00:08:06,247 --> 00:08:09,987
How do you make youself so sober and
emotional to make everybody cry like that?

77
00:08:09,988 --> 00:08:11,073
It's not that hard really.

78
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:15,235
I just think about the saddest moment in my life.

79
00:08:19,387 --> 00:08:23,223
Man wow! Gary is such a great guy

80
00:08:36,576 --> 00:08:38,072
Hello young man!

81
00:08:38,074 --> 00:08:40,485
Congratulations on a terrific performance.

82
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,516
Oh, thank you! I don't believe we've met Mr. ...?

83
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:48,544
The name is Spottswoode

84
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,388
Well nice to meet you.

85
00:08:50,422 --> 00:08:52,185
And you are Gary Justin

86
00:08:52,187 --> 00:08:54,777
All-American actor who graduated Iowa University

87
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:56,604
Summa cum laude with a double major in...

88
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:58,339
theater and world languages

89
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:01,396
You've been at the top of every acting class
since you were a child.

90
00:09:01,396 --> 00:09:05,232
Top gun actor.

91
00:09:05,233 --> 00:09:08,206
Hey hold on a second are you from Hollywood?

92
00:09:08,206 --> 00:09:10,274
I have an incredible offer for you Gary.

93
00:09:10,276 --> 00:09:14,588
If you are interested follow me this way.

94
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:35,157
Please Gary, step into my car.

95
00:09:36,404 --> 00:09:37,594
Oh I get it!

96
00:09:37,595 --> 00:09:40,470
I'm supposed to get in your car and
let you put your finger inside me.

97
00:09:40,472 --> 00:09:42,852
Then if I go down on you I get a movie part.

98
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:47,146
No I just want to show you something

99
00:09:47,146 --> 00:09:48,488
Yeah, I bet you do

100
00:09:48,377 --> 00:09:49,936
Please Gary I'm not from Hollywood

101
00:09:49,937 --> 00:09:51,522
I am not going to fuck your mouth...

102
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,480
and my time is extremely valuable!

103
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,424
Jesus this is a nice limo.

104
00:10:06,424 --> 00:10:10,260
Yes it is! Now suck my cock!

105
00:10:10,645 --> 00:10:14,481
Haha! Just kidding.

106
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,153
All right. Just what the hell is this about?

107
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:24,839
I hate to break this to you Gary ...

108
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,099
but some people out there want you dead.

109
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,963
Dead?

110
00:10:28,964 --> 00:10:30,293
They are called terrorists, Gary ...

111
00:10:30,294 --> 00:10:32,461
and they hate everything about you.

112
00:10:33,088 --> 00:10:36,636
Why? What did I do to them? I am just a Broadway actor.

113
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:39,017
It's not who you are Gary. It's what you stand for.

114
00:10:39,017 --> 00:10:41,407
And every single mintue of every single day

115
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:43,480
The terrorists are planning new ways to kill you.

116
00:10:43,482 --> 00:10:45,993
And everyone else who lives in a free country.

117
00:10:47,283 --> 00:10:51,119
The only thing standing in their way...is us.

118
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:53,708
You?

119
00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:57,545
Baxter, I think we can valmorphanize safely now.

120
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,456
OK a limousine that can fly!

121
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:32,071
Now I have seen everything!

122
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:35,525
Really? Have you seen a man eat his own head?

123
00:11:35,526 --> 00:11:39,362
- No
- So then you haven't seen everything and neither have we.

124
00:11:40,226 --> 00:11:44,062
Last week in Paris we got four terrorists
with a weapon of mass destruction.

125
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:48,666
The terrorists are planning something very big.

126
00:11:48,858 --> 00:11:51,159
And just what does this have to do with me?

127
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,464
Our only hope is to have somebody act like a terrorist...

128
00:11:53,465 --> 00:11:55,948
who wants to help them carry out the attack.

129
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:57,243
An actor convincing enough

130
00:11:57,244 --> 00:11:59,504
to make the terrorists think he is one of them.

131
00:12:00,943 --> 00:12:03,218
This is crazy. I am an actor not a spy.

132
00:12:03,218 --> 00:12:05,551
That's all spying is...Acting!

133
00:12:05,551 --> 00:12:07,182
And they say you are the best!

134
00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:10,438
An actor with a double major in theater and world languages.

135
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:14,274
Hell you are the perfect weapon Gary.

136
00:12:14,946 --> 00:12:18,782
Look out!

137
00:12:45,446 --> 00:12:49,282
Right this way you maverick renegade.

138
00:13:00,024 --> 00:13:03,476
Welcome to team base.

139
00:13:03,477 --> 00:13:07,313
Gary, this is Joe.
All-star quarterback from the University of Nebraska.

140
00:13:07,505 --> 00:13:09,615
He is a natural born leader.

141
00:13:09,615 --> 00:13:11,533
I've heard a lot about your acting Mr. Johnston

142
00:13:11,534 --> 00:13:13,260
I hope it's as good as they say it is.

143
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:17,096
And this is Sarah. The top empath from Berkely school
for the clairvoyant in San Franciso.

144
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:22,755
I sense that you are slightly confused right now.

145
00:13:23,906 --> 00:13:26,016
That's suppose to be Carson's replacement?

146
00:13:26,016 --> 00:13:27,646
A fucking actor?

147
00:13:27,647 --> 00:13:31,483
Don't mind Chris. He may be lacking courtesy
but he is the best martial art expert Detroit has to offer.

148
00:13:33,593 --> 00:13:37,429
That's right actor. Just stay the fuck away from me.

149
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:41,553
And finally we have our psychology expert. Where is Lisa?

150
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:46,157
Right here.

151
00:13:51,337 --> 00:13:55,173
Gary, this is Lisa. She specializes in how the terrorists think.

152
00:13:55,653 --> 00:13:59,489
Usually a case of malignant narcissism brought under in childhood.

153
00:13:59,777 --> 00:14:02,270
We've been doing our best to keep the world safe, Gary.

154
00:14:02,271 --> 00:14:05,340
But now somebody has supplied the terrorists with WMDs.

155
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,929
And Intelligence tells us they plan to use them.

156
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,423
Isn't that right Intelligence?

157
00:14:10,423 --> 00:14:12,533
That is affirmative!

158
00:14:12,533 --> 00:14:13,875
Intelligence?

159
00:14:13,876 --> 00:14:16,465
The most sophisticated computer in the world.

160
00:14:16,466 --> 00:14:20,302
I've intercepted communications that several terrorists groups
are being organized for one massive world wide attack.

161
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:27,399
From what Intelligence has gathered it would be 911 times 100.

162
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:32,770
911 times 100 Jesus that's ...

163
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,990
... yes, 91100.

164
00:14:36,991 --> 00:14:40,827
Basically all the worst parts of the Bible.

165
00:14:40,827 --> 00:14:43,224
So now you see why we need you.

166
00:14:43,225 --> 00:14:47,061
We will disguise you as a terrorist and take you deep
into the Middle East. If your acting is successful

167
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:52,432
you'll be able to get us all the information
we need to stop this whole thing from happening.

168
00:14:52,912 --> 00:14:55,693
Of course ... if you are not interested ...

169
00:14:55,693 --> 00:14:59,529
there's the door.

170
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:03,366
All right. Thanks.

171
00:15:07,778 --> 00:15:11,614
Huh.

172
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:15,259
Gary, hey. Hold on a second!

173
00:15:15,259 --> 00:15:18,711
Don't you understand? Every country in the world is in danger.

174
00:15:18,712 --> 00:15:21,397
How is it my responsibility to do something?

175
00:15:21,398 --> 00:15:25,234
Because like it or not,
you're the one with the power to do something.

176
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:32,139
I can't fight terrorists. I don't know nothing about guns or jets.

177
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,976
That doesn't matter. If you wanna help people
all that matters is Gary is what you have here.

178
00:15:45,184 --> 00:15:49,020
Just think about it, ok. Here, take this.

179
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:55,158
Baxter will take you wherever you wanna go.

180
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:58,995
Just remember your freedom is at stake too.

181
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:13,189
What do you think Spottswoode sees in him ?

182
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:17,026
I don't know. But I think I see it too.

183
00:16:32,948 --> 00:16:37,217
Hey Baxter I wanna take a detour.

184
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:40,603
# What would you do #

185
00:16:40,604 --> 00:16:44,668
# if you were asked to give up your dreams for freedom? #

186
00:16:45,992 --> 00:16:51,802
# What would you do if that is to make the ultimate sacrifice? #

187
00:16:52,034 --> 00:16:55,390
# Would you think about all them people? #

188
00:16:55,391 --> 00:16:59,140
# Who gave up everything they had? #

189
00:16:59,368 --> 00:17:02,679
# Would you think about all them war vets #

190
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,516
# and would you start to feel bad? #

191
00:17:08,531 --> 00:17:11,791
# Freedom isn't free #

192
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:15,340
# It costs folks like you and me #

193
00:17:15,341 --> 00:17:22,286
# And if we don't all chip in we'll never pay that bill #

194
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:26,178
# Freedom isn't free #

195
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:30,015
# No there is a hefty fuckin' fee #

196
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:36,590
# And if you don't throw in your buck 'o five who will? #

197
00:17:37,753 --> 00:17:39,692
# Buck 'o five #

198
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:44,689
# Freedom costs a buck 'o five #

199
00:18:21,706 --> 00:18:23,364
Our dear leader Kim Jong-Il...

200
00:18:23,366 --> 00:18:25,473
says the weapons of mass destruction you requested

201
00:18:25,474 --> 00:18:26,853
are ready for you to take.

202
00:18:27,466 --> 00:18:29,478
I am still in the process of recuriting...

203
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:31,693
and training new terrorists for the attack.

204
00:18:31,922 --> 00:18:34,922
We take weapons later.

205
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:44,202
He asked what part of the deal you did not understand.

206
00:18:44,203 --> 00:18:46,840
He says perhaps his translator did not make it clear to you.

207
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,676
He says he should fire ... his translator.

208
00:18:54,129 --> 00:18:57,198
Do you have any idea how fucking busy I am?

209
00:18:57,064 --> 00:18:59,555
I can not believe that I actually have a Chenchnen standing here

210
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:02,100
telling me when he is going to take a delivery.

211
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,296
Hello.

212
00:19:04,296 --> 00:19:06,693
Perhaps we can be ready sooner.

213
00:19:06,694 --> 00:19:08,574
Yes, perhaps you can.

214
00:19:08,576 --> 00:19:11,182
Now take your weapons of mass desctruction and

215
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:13,744
get the fuck out of here!

216
00:19:31,151 --> 00:19:33,644
I ... had to come back.

217
00:19:33,645 --> 00:19:34,987
I know you did son.

218
00:19:34,988 --> 00:19:36,810
I still say this is a fucking mistake.

219
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:40,550
Stop it Chris! I sense that you are making him feel intimidated.

220
00:19:40,551 --> 00:19:42,277
Gary I am afraid there is no time.

221
00:19:42,277 --> 00:19:44,578
Intelligence tells us that the attack is imminent.

222
00:19:44,579 --> 00:19:47,839
We need you to act like a Middle Eastern terrorist right away.

223
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,470
There is just one problem.

224
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,963
I don't look Middle Eastern.

225
00:19:51,964 --> 00:19:55,800
Hahaha - leave that to us!

226
00:20:06,351 --> 00:20:10,187
Sarah is a professional at skin graphing and laser valmorphication.

227
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:14,886
Just try to be still.

228
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,714
Amazing!

229
00:20:49,888 --> 00:20:52,388
The valmorphication completely worked.

230
00:20:52,388 --> 00:20:56,224
Sit up and take a look Gary!

231
00:20:59,965 --> 00:21:02,170
It's uncanny.

232
00:21:02,171 --> 00:21:04,229
You are going to fool everyone Gary.

233
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:07,047
...or should I say Hakmed?

234
00:21:08,693 --> 00:21:12,145
All right team, we only get one shot at this so listen up!

235
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:14,693
Intelligence has intercepted communications that terrorists

236
00:21:14,694 --> 00:21:18,571
from different countries are gathering at a tavern! Here! In Cairo.

237
00:21:19,148 --> 00:21:22,121
Cairo ... that's in Egypt.

238
00:21:22,121 --> 00:21:24,039
Exactly right Joe.

239
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:25,142
Now team your mission.

240
00:21:25,144 --> 00:21:27,310
We'll be to get Gary into that tavern.

241
00:21:27,312 --> 00:21:30,352
And once he is on the inside, cover his back!

242
00:21:31,232 --> 00:21:33,231
Gary, you must use your acting to find out

243
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:35,856
any information you can from the terrorists.

244
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:40,742
Gary, if for some reason you cover is blown...

245
00:21:40,744 --> 00:21:42,964
and the terrorists take you prisoner ...

246
00:21:43,317 --> 00:21:46,482
well you will probably want to take your own life.

247
00:21:46,482 --> 00:21:50,318
Here you better have this.

248
00:21:54,227 --> 00:21:56,975
All right team! That's it! We've got a job to do.

249
00:21:56,976 --> 00:22:00,574
Let's go police the World!

250
00:22:00,576 --> 00:22:06,681
# America~America~ #

251
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:09,580
# -America #
# -Fuck Yeah! #

252
00:22:09,582 --> 00:22:12,453
# Coming again to save the mother fucking day yeah~ #

253
00:22:12,454 --> 00:22:14,920
# -America #
# -Fuck Yeah! #

254
00:22:14,922 --> 00:22:17,963
# Freedom is the only way yeah! #

255
00:22:17,964 --> 00:22:20,329
# Terrorists your game is through~ #

256
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:23,315
# 'cause now you have to answer to~ #

257
00:22:23,317 --> 00:22:25,859
# -America #
# -Fuck Yeah! #

258
00:22:25,861 --> 00:22:28,817
# So lick my butt and suck on my balls~ #

259
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:31,241
# -America #
# -Fuck Yeah! #

260
00:22:33,863 --> 00:22:36,260
What if the old man is wrong about him, uh?

261
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:40,096
What if he is not the actor Spottswoode says he is?

262
00:22:40,768 --> 00:22:44,604
Why don't you trust actors Chris?

263
00:22:45,084 --> 00:22:48,920
I got my reasons.

264
00:22:51,318 --> 00:22:53,907
You're all right Gary?

265
00:22:53,908 --> 00:22:55,190
I was just thinking...

266
00:22:55,191 --> 00:22:58,422
on stage if I mess up a line it could mean a bad review.

267
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:03,115
If I mess up here...we're all dead.

268
00:23:04,075 --> 00:23:06,856
I believe you can do this Gary

269
00:23:06,856 --> 00:23:07,911
Why?

270
00:23:07,911 --> 00:23:11,459
What reason do you have to believe?

271
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:15,296
Sometimes ... believing is all we have.

272
00:24:07,316 --> 00:24:10,562
Fear not Muslim friends! We are here to find terrorists...

273
00:24:10,563 --> 00:24:13,776
I am clearing your minds of all anxiety.

274
00:24:13,882 --> 00:24:15,216
All right, good job Sarah.

275
00:24:15,217 --> 00:24:17,591
Now everyone make for the tavern.

276
00:24:17,867 --> 00:24:20,228
Let's get one thing straight actor - I don't trust you.

277
00:24:20,229 --> 00:24:22,625
And if you betray us I'll rip your fucking balls off

278
00:24:22,626 --> 00:24:24,362
and stuff them up your ass, so the next time you shit...

279
00:24:24,364 --> 00:24:26,459
you'll shit all over your balls. Got it?

280
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,997
What's your problem with me?

281
00:24:27,997 --> 00:24:28,860
Yeah, you want a go?

282
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,313
Guys, guys, guys!

283
00:24:30,314 --> 00:24:33,051
Don't you see this is just what the terrorists want us to do?

284
00:24:33,464 --> 00:24:37,300
The war is out there man - out there. Now pull it together!

285
00:24:39,027 --> 00:24:42,863
All right team, let's move to the inner city. Keep it quiet!

286
00:24:53,702 --> 00:24:56,099
Clear, Clear, Clear, Clear

287
00:24:56,099 --> 00:24:56,769
All right Gary, you follow me!

288
00:24:56,771 --> 00:24:59,418
The rest of the team takes super secret hiding positions alpha one.

289
00:25:02,525 --> 00:25:05,147
All right that's the tavern with the blue door.

290
00:25:05,149 --> 00:25:09,527
Act your way past those guards! Dee what you can find out!

291
00:25:09,719 --> 00:25:12,500
Temember if you think they are onto you give us the signal.

292
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,336
You remember the signal?

293
00:25:16,337 --> 00:25:17,487
That's right.

294
00:25:17,488 --> 00:25:21,324
All right, good luck.

295
00:25:21,612 --> 00:25:25,448
Go get 'em cowboy!

296
00:25:54,126 --> 00:25:55,181
Oh shit!

297
00:25:55,181 --> 00:25:59,017
Come on Gary act. You have the power.

298
00:26:15,994 --> 00:26:17,432
All right Gary.

299
00:26:17,432 --> 00:26:18,487
Told you he was top gun.

300
00:26:18,487 --> 00:26:20,405
I've never seen acting that good.

301
00:26:20,405 --> 00:26:24,241
He's amazing.

302
00:26:43,424 --> 00:26:45,835
We are Bashi rebels from the country of Somalia.

303
00:26:45,836 --> 00:26:47,477
Who are you?

304
00:26:48,891 --> 00:26:51,384
My...name is Hakmed.

305
00:26:51,385 --> 00:26:52,642
I am a terrorist.

306
00:26:55,145 --> 00:26:58,869
Anybody know of any terrorist attacks coming up soon?

307
00:27:11,334 --> 00:27:15,170
I sense that I am becoming attracted to Gary.

308
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:18,405
My advise is not to get involved with the team members, Sarah.

309
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,716
It's to painful to see them die.

310
00:27:22,077 --> 00:27:24,282
I am sorry Lisa I didn't mean to bring out...

311
00:27:24,283 --> 00:27:26,105
It's ok Sarah.

312
00:27:26,105 --> 00:27:28,119
I treasure your friendship.

313
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:31,955
I treasure yours Lisa.

314
00:27:36,367 --> 00:27:40,203
Hey have you ever thought of telling Sarah how you feel?

315
00:27:40,204 --> 00:27:42,859
Ah, what would a girl like Sarah want with a...

316
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:45,165
simple Nebraska Boy like me?

317
00:27:45,383 --> 00:27:49,219
I don't know nothing about fancy cars and fancy restaurants.

318
00:27:49,315 --> 00:27:53,151
Still I'd love to show her a full moon night on the corn fields.

319
00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:09,360
What do you know?

320
00:28:09,361 --> 00:28:12,430
I heard there may be a large terrorist attack.

321
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:16,170
If you tell me what it is maybe I can help out.

322
00:28:16,171 --> 00:28:17,090
Get out of here!

323
00:28:17,091 --> 00:28:19,289
We have put a jihad on the infidels

324
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:21,894
because they destroy our lives.

325
00:28:22,693 --> 00:28:26,529
What do you know about pain and sadness?

326
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:34,509
Gary, Gary, Gary!

327
00:28:36,312 --> 00:28:38,890
I was just a boy when the infidels came to my village

328
00:28:38,891 --> 00:28:41,124
in their black hawk hellicopters.

329
00:28:42,642 --> 00:28:44,387
The infidels fired at the oil fields and

330
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,724
they lid up like the eyes of Allah.

331
00:28:46,942 --> 00:28:48,731
Burning oil rain down from the sky

332
00:28:48,733 --> 00:28:50,324
cooked everything it touched.

333
00:28:50,325 --> 00:28:52,216
I could only hide myself and cry...

334
00:28:52,217 --> 00:28:55,762
as my goats were consumed by fiery black liquid death.

335
00:28:58,564 --> 00:28:59,863
In the midst of the chaos...

336
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:04,577
I could swear that I heard my goats ... screaming for help.

337
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,976
As quickly as they'd come the infidels were gone.

338
00:29:09,977 --> 00:29:13,813
It was on that day I put a jihad on them.

339
00:29:16,691 --> 00:29:18,147
And if you don't believe it

340
00:29:18,149 --> 00:29:20,353
then you better kill me now.

341
00:29:20,354 --> 00:29:23,966
Because I'ill put a jihad on you too.

342
00:29:29,927 --> 00:29:33,763
I like you. You have balls. I like balls

343
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,230
All right, listen carefully!

344
00:29:38,232 --> 00:29:40,843
The WMDs are located in a secret bunker

345
00:29:40,844 --> 00:29:42,785
20 yards east of this building.

346
00:29:42,786 --> 00:29:44,526
You can help us by grabbing it...

347
00:29:49,308 --> 00:29:50,896
Come! They're onto us.

348
00:29:50,898 --> 00:29:55,535
Hurry friend! We must make our escape.

349
00:29:56,686 --> 00:30:00,426
Shit! I've got 5 terrorists going southeast on Bacalacadaca street.

350
00:30:00,426 --> 00:30:02,410
Don't let them get away!

351
00:30:07,524 --> 00:30:09,825
I sense that Gary is trapped inside the tavern.

352
00:30:09,826 --> 00:30:13,662
Copy Sarah. You get Gary and we'll go after the terrorists.

353
00:30:13,663 --> 00:30:16,356
# America~ #

354
00:30:16,357 --> 00:30:19,245
# -America #
# -Fuck Yeah! #

355
00:30:19,247 --> 00:30:22,028
# Coming again to save the mother fucking day yeah~ #

356
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:24,635
# -America #
# -Fuck Yeah! #

357
00:30:24,636 --> 00:30:27,810
# Freedom is the only way yeah! #

358
00:30:28,656 --> 00:30:31,011
# It's the dream that we all share #

359
00:30:31,013 --> 00:30:35,661
# -It's the hope for tomorrow~ #
# - Fuck Yeah! #

360
00:30:41,058 --> 00:30:43,840
Die infidels!

361
00:30:50,864 --> 00:30:51,812
They're not stopping.

362
00:30:51,786 --> 00:30:54,183
They had their chance.

363
00:31:01,906 --> 00:31:05,742
Missed wide right.

364
00:31:05,934 --> 00:31:08,331
One of the terrorist is trying to tell us something.

365
00:31:08,332 --> 00:31:10,537
It's me, it's me.

366
00:31:10,538 --> 00:31:13,798
Looks like he is saying "kiss me, kiss me".

367
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:17,635
Smartass motherfucker

368
00:31:29,145 --> 00:31:30,391
Gary?

369
00:31:30,391 --> 00:31:31,637
An infidel.

370
00:31:31,638 --> 00:31:35,474
Get up!

371
00:31:43,244 --> 00:31:47,080
Gary?

372
00:31:48,423 --> 00:31:50,149
Sarah to Team America 4

373
00:31:50,149 --> 00:31:51,395
What you got Sarah?

374
00:31:51,396 --> 00:31:52,688
Gary isn't in the tavern.

375
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,994
I think he maybe...with....terror....

376
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,536
Say again Sarah. You're breaking up.

377
00:31:56,537 --> 00:31:58,142
Joe do you copy?

378
00:31:58,143 --> 00:31:59,925
I'll get him.

379
00:32:00,604 --> 00:32:01,995
Lisa?

380
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,454
I lost her.

381
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:07,718
It's all right. We'll kill these guys

382
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:09,179
and we'll find out what she wants.

383
00:32:09,907 --> 00:32:13,743
All right.

384
00:32:18,155 --> 00:32:20,073
Hey, hey guys I think we should pull over.

385
00:32:20,074 --> 00:32:20,692
Pull over?

386
00:32:20,693 --> 00:32:21,787
Yes of course!

387
00:32:21,788 --> 00:32:23,045
Pull over let them pass us ...

388
00:32:23,047 --> 00:32:24,892
and when they turn around we charge them.

389
00:32:24,926 --> 00:32:28,705
I love your balls.

390
00:32:29,665 --> 00:32:31,327
Shit they got by me.

391
00:32:35,132 --> 00:32:36,474
What are we doing?

392
00:32:36,474 --> 00:32:38,310
This jeep is filled with explosives.

393
00:32:38,312 --> 00:32:40,830
We're going take their lives and our own.

394
00:32:40,832 --> 00:32:43,572
We...we gonna what?

395
00:32:43,572 --> 00:32:44,531
Hang on Joe!

396
00:32:44,531 --> 00:32:48,367
Die infidels!

397
00:32:56,808 --> 00:33:00,644
Suprise cockheads!

398
00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:06,015
Ahh!

399
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:19,346
All right we fucking did it.

400
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:22,324
Spottswoode, this is Lisa.

401
00:33:22,326 --> 00:33:25,874
Gary found the WMDs and the terrorists are down.

402
00:33:25,876 --> 00:33:29,705
Great job team. Head back to base for deep briefing and cocktails.

403
00:33:33,734 --> 00:33:37,570
This is breaking news with Peter Jennings.

404
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:39,756
Team America has once again pissed off

405
00:33:39,758 --> 00:33:42,462
the entire world after blowing up half of Cairo.

406
00:33:42,749 --> 00:33:45,651
And now some Hollywood celebrities are lashing out.

407
00:33:45,652 --> 00:33:48,921
Alec Baldwin is head of the Film Actors Guild.

408
00:33:49,943 --> 00:33:51,493
The Film Actors Guild believes that

409
00:33:51,494 --> 00:33:53,988
what the world needs is compassion not violence.

410
00:33:54,067 --> 00:33:57,903
All that Team America does is create new enemies.

411
00:33:58,287 --> 00:34:00,301
Let me explain to you how this works.

412
00:34:00,302 --> 00:34:03,288
You see the corporations finance Team America ...

413
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:05,136
and then Team America goes out...

414
00:34:05,137 --> 00:34:06,917
and the Corporations sit there in their...

415
00:34:06,918 --> 00:34:08,911
in their corporation buildings

416
00:34:08,945 --> 00:34:11,545
and ... and see that they are all corporationy

417
00:34:11,546 --> 00:34:13,127
and they make money.

418
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:15,799
Last year I went to Iraq.

419
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,583
Before Team America showed up it was a happy place.

420
00:34:18,812 --> 00:34:21,131
They had flowery metals and rainbow skies...

421
00:34:21,132 --> 00:34:23,226
and rivers made of chcolates where the children

422
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:26,113
danced and laughed and played with gun drop smiles.

423
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,415
The actors are calling for an emergency meeting.

424
00:34:28,416 --> 00:34:29,873
All ready excepted to attend are:

425
00:34:30,003 --> 00:34:31,121
Helen Hunt

426
00:34:31,122 --> 00:34:32,239
George Clooney

427
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,295
Liv Tyler

428
00:34:33,295 --> 00:34:34,637
Martin Sheen

429
00:34:34,637 --> 00:34:35,883
Susan Sarandon

430
00:34:35,884 --> 00:34:37,130
Janeane Garofalo

431
00:34:37,131 --> 00:34:38,377
and Matt Damon

432
00:34:38,378 --> 00:34:41,159
Matt Damon

433
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:41,885
In the mean time

434
00:34:41,886 --> 00:34:44,068
the world wants to deal with dangerous individuals...

435
00:34:44,227 --> 00:34:45,714
their own way.

436
00:35:03,219 --> 00:35:07,055
Hans Blix. Oh no!

437
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:10,508
Oh hello. Great to see you again Hans.

438
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:14,121
Mr. ll, I was supposed to be allowed to inspect your palace today

439
00:35:14,123 --> 00:35:16,957
and you guards won't let me into certain areas.

440
00:35:17,126 --> 00:35:18,391
Hans, Hans, Hans!

441
00:35:18,392 --> 00:35:20,187
We being through this a dozen times!

442
00:35:20,189 --> 00:35:24,311
I don't have any weapons mass destruction, ok Hans?

443
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,257
Then let me look around

444
00:35:25,258 --> 00:35:27,532
so I can ease U.N.'s collective mind.

445
00:35:27,772 --> 00:35:29,827
Hans, you are breaking my balls here, Hans...

446
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:31,238
you are breaking my balls!

447
00:35:31,417 --> 00:35:33,539
I am sorry but the U.N. must be firm with you!

448
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:37,088
Let me see your whole palace or else ...

449
00:35:37,363 --> 00:35:39,568
Or else what?

450
00:35:39,569 --> 00:35:43,021
Or else we will be very, very angry with you.

451
00:35:43,022 --> 00:35:46,858
And we will write you a letter telling you how angry we are.

452
00:35:48,201 --> 00:35:53,360
Ok! I will show you Hans, you ready? Stand a little to your left.

453
00:35:55,154 --> 00:35:56,158
Little more...

454
00:35:57,694 --> 00:35:58,373
Good!

455
00:36:04,728 --> 00:36:05,917
There you go Hans Blix!

456
00:36:05,918 --> 00:36:08,576
How you like that you fucking cock sucker?

457
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:14,672
You have any idea how fucking busy I am Hans Blix?

458
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:15,653
Well, fuck you!

459
00:36:15,654 --> 00:36:17,733
You are inspecting? Well inspect that!

460
00:36:17,735 --> 00:36:19,988
You buttfucking piece of shit.

461
00:36:21,015 --> 00:36:23,219
What? You think I am just a petty arms dealer?

462
00:36:23,497 --> 00:36:24,906
I am planning the attack!

463
00:36:24,908 --> 00:36:27,127
Congratulations Team America!

464
00:36:27,128 --> 00:36:29,237
You have stopped nothing!

465
00:36:47,667 --> 00:36:50,615
Congratulations Gary. You've done an amazing thing.

466
00:36:50,882 --> 00:36:52,818
It will be years before the terrorists

467
00:36:52,819 --> 00:36:54,937
have the resources to attack again!

468
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:57,736
We are going to be unstoppable with you on the team Gary.

469
00:36:57,737 --> 00:37:00,614
Terrorist your game is through.

470
00:37:00,615 --> 00:37:02,632
You're the best, Gary.

471
00:37:03,836 --> 00:37:06,863
When this terrorist shoots at us from the back of his jeep and...

472
00:37:07,108 --> 00:37:09,240
You might have all the others fooled but not me.

473
00:37:09,241 --> 00:37:12,164
Your acting was reckless and it put us all in danger.

474
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,613
The next time you put a stun like that...

475
00:37:13,614 --> 00:37:15,051
I'll drill two holes for your dick.

476
00:37:15,052 --> 00:37:15,811
So that when you pee

477
00:37:15,813 --> 00:37:17,719
it will shoot out in all directions.

478
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,396
You got it?!

479
00:37:21,523 --> 00:37:23,153
Hey Sarah do you mind if I dance with you?

480
00:37:23,154 --> 00:37:26,990
No of course not Joe.

481
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:38,211
Joe do you think it's ok for team members to date?

482
00:37:38,787 --> 00:37:41,280
Sarah really?

483
00:37:41,281 --> 00:37:43,199
Yeah do you think it's all right?

484
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:44,541
I think it's better than all right.

485
00:37:44,542 --> 00:37:48,378
- It's great.
- Oh good. I'm so glad you think so.

486
00:38:01,327 --> 00:38:03,340
Gary, you're ok?

487
00:38:04,396 --> 00:38:08,232
I was just wondering if I can let go of an old painful memory.

488
00:38:09,767 --> 00:38:12,836
Is it anything you want to talk about?

489
00:38:12,836 --> 00:38:16,672
When I was a kid I always looked up to my older brother Tommy.

490
00:38:16,768 --> 00:38:19,626
He was the jock and I was the little performer.

491
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:22,543
We were all at the zoo one day.

492
00:38:22,544 --> 00:38:24,602
I was doing some acting...

493
00:38:24,603 --> 00:38:27,079
walking on the railing of the gorilla exhibit.

494
00:38:27,081 --> 00:38:28,871
I fell in.

495
00:38:29,429 --> 00:38:31,895
Everyone screamed and Tommy jumped in after me

496
00:38:32,657 --> 00:38:35,440
forgetting that he had blueberries in his front pocket.

497
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:38,345
The gorillas just went wild.

498
00:38:39,122 --> 00:38:40,848
They jumped all over his body...

499
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:43,819
and threw him around like a rag doll to get to those blueberries.

500
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:46,486
One gorilla would throw him to another gorilla

501
00:38:46,487 --> 00:38:48,982
who would toss him to another.

502
00:38:50,817 --> 00:38:53,442
Everyone panicked and cried out for somebody to help - but...

503
00:38:53,443 --> 00:38:54,688
it was too late...

504
00:38:55,201 --> 00:38:57,310
The gorillas beat him to death

505
00:38:57,311 --> 00:38:59,605
before the zoo keepers could gas them all.

506
00:39:03,072 --> 00:39:06,587
My acting got my brother killed.

507
00:39:06,588 --> 00:39:10,599
I had to live with that every single day.

508
00:39:11,342 --> 00:39:15,178
Gary you can't blame yourself for what the gorillas did.

509
00:39:15,466 --> 00:39:17,959
I think I can finally let it go,

510
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,862
because...my acting saved the entire world.

511
00:39:20,896 --> 00:39:23,156
And something even better happened.

512
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,800
What?

513
00:39:25,057 --> 00:39:28,893
I met somebody who ... took my breath away.

514
00:39:34,073 --> 00:39:36,854
Gary, no!

515
00:39:36,854 --> 00:39:37,748
I am sorry.

516
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:41,411
It's just ... things are really complicated Gary.

517
00:39:41,842 --> 00:39:43,952
I know about Carson.

518
00:39:43,952 --> 00:39:46,445
I know how it feels.

519
00:39:46,446 --> 00:39:48,460
God I am so confused.

520
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:52,104
It's too soon to be having feelings for you.

521
00:39:52,104 --> 00:39:56,949
Maybe feelings are feelings because we can't control them.

522
00:39:57,092 --> 00:39:58,542
But I have to control them

523
00:39:58,543 --> 00:40:01,483
because I can't go through losing somebody again. It's too painful!

524
00:40:01,696 --> 00:40:04,171
So...so what? You're just gonna shut down?

525
00:40:04,294 --> 00:40:08,313
I really like you - there's no chance we can ever be togther?

526
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:13,731
Only if you could promise me you'll never die.

527
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,274
You know I can't promise you that.

528
00:40:16,274 --> 00:40:20,110
If you did that I would make love to you right now.

529
00:40:24,043 --> 00:40:27,879
I promise. I will never die.

530
00:40:45,424 --> 00:40:49,342
# I need this, I need love, I need you~ #

531
00:40:51,841 --> 00:40:56,548
# I don't need one heartbeat, I need two~ #

532
00:40:58,146 --> 00:41:01,216
# There is an emptiness I need to fill~ #

533
00:41:01,217 --> 00:41:05,499
# And only one emptiness will do~ #

534
00:41:05,501 --> 00:41:07,927
# Only a woman~ #

535
00:41:07,928 --> 00:41:11,712
# Can brighten up my day~ #

536
00:41:11,714 --> 00:41:14,110
# Only a woman~ #

537
00:41:14,112 --> 00:41:18,571
# Can touch me the right way~ #

538
00:41:18,572 --> 00:41:20,973
# Only a woman~ #

539
00:41:20,975 --> 00:41:24,647
# Is allowed to touch me there~ #

540
00:41:25,266 --> 00:41:28,821
# All I ask is that you're a woman~ #

541
00:41:29,742 --> 00:41:33,098
Lisa you are the most amazing person I've ever met.

542
00:41:33,099 --> 00:41:34,271
It's only being a short time...

543
00:41:34,272 --> 00:41:35,755
but I think that I am completely in love...

544
00:41:35,757 --> 00:41:37,492
shhh

545
00:41:37,493 --> 00:41:39,909
Let's not talk.

546
00:41:39,909 --> 00:41:42,690
I can't help it. It just feels so right.

547
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:44,320
I don't want anything to mess it up.

548
00:41:44,321 --> 00:41:47,006
shhh

549
00:41:47,006 --> 00:41:50,842
There is not a thing in the world that can mess this up.

550
00:43:34,907 --> 00:43:37,880
Team I'm afraid I have bad news.

551
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,716
At 7:15 this morning the terrorists carried out their attack.

552
00:43:43,539 --> 00:43:44,402
What?

553
00:43:44,402 --> 00:43:48,238
But how can that be? Gary stopped the terrorists in Cairo.

554
00:43:48,238 --> 00:43:49,969
It appears now that Intelligence was wrong about

555
00:43:49,971 --> 00:43:51,969
the Chechenens being in charge.

556
00:43:52,913 --> 00:43:56,033
That was bad intelligence. Very bad intelligence!

557
00:43:56,035 --> 00:43:57,734
I am sorry.

558
00:43:58,405 --> 00:44:02,241
We have to find out who did this and take them down ... Fast.

559
00:44:02,817 --> 00:44:06,552
Sir I'm intercepting communications about the terrorist identities.

560
00:44:06,554 --> 00:44:07,753
On screen!

561
00:44:08,572 --> 00:44:12,408
This is breaking news with Peter Jennings.

562
00:44:12,408 --> 00:44:15,285
An attack in Panama today has left thousands dead.

563
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:19,121
Taking credit were terrorists from Derkaderkastain.

564
00:44:19,218 --> 00:44:21,807
Of course Derkaderkastain.

565
00:44:21,807 --> 00:44:23,128
The terrorists claim that the attack was

566
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:26,028
retaliation for Team America's action in Cairo.

567
00:44:26,315 --> 00:44:30,151
Alec Baldwin is rallying all the members of the Film Actors Guild.

568
00:44:30,439 --> 00:44:31,781
Alec Baldwin!

569
00:44:31,782 --> 00:44:32,549
Gary?

570
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:36,386
He is ... he is my hero! The single greatest actor of all time.

571
00:44:37,153 --> 00:44:40,222
Who is to blame for these attack at Panama?

572
00:44:40,222 --> 00:44:43,679
The terrorists? The person who supplied them with the WMDs?

573
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:47,611
No! Blame Team America!

574
00:44:48,663 --> 00:44:50,577
their reckless disregard in Cairo...

575
00:44:50,578 --> 00:44:52,574
brought on this violence today!

576
00:44:52,576 --> 00:44:53,535
Team America ...

577
00:44:53,362 --> 00:44:57,198
the blood of the victims of Panama is on your hands.

578
00:45:00,843 --> 00:45:02,364
Moved by Alec Baldwin's impassionate speech

579
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:07,619
hundreds of people turned out at Mountain Rushmore today to protest.

580
00:45:09,667 --> 00:45:11,789
Hey that's here.

581
00:45:11,791 --> 00:45:14,163
Tom! It looks like filmmaker Michael Moore

582
00:45:14,165 --> 00:45:17,487
is also jumping on the fuck Team America bandwagon!

583
00:45:18,779 --> 00:45:20,474
Protesting is not enough!

584
00:45:20,476 --> 00:45:24,593
We must take radical action against the fascists in our own country!

585
00:45:24,629 --> 00:45:28,465
Bring it down, bring it all down!

586
00:45:33,357 --> 00:45:36,446
Team, if the Dekaderkastanies have weapons of mass destruction

587
00:45:36,448 --> 00:45:39,566
I am afraid it could be 911 times a thousand.

588
00:45:40,167 --> 00:45:41,701
Jesus you mean ...

589
00:45:41,702 --> 00:45:45,538
Yes! 911,000.

590
00:45:46,401 --> 00:45:48,319
Then forget all this assholes. We got work to do.

591
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,101
Yes let's get Gary valmorphinized so we can use his acting.

592
00:45:51,102 --> 00:45:56,356
My acting? My acting! My acting just got a thousand people killed!

593
00:45:56,472 --> 00:45:58,294
Jesus I've done it again.

594
00:45:58,294 --> 00:46:01,267
Pull yourself together Gary. We need you now more than ever.

595
00:46:01,268 --> 00:46:03,186
I'm through with this.

596
00:46:03,186 --> 00:46:03,761
Gary you can't go.

597
00:46:03,762 --> 00:46:05,134
Without you the team is doomed!

598
00:46:05,136 --> 00:46:08,520
Remember there is no "I" in Team America.

599
00:46:08,845 --> 00:46:11,197
Yes there is.

600
00:46:13,447 --> 00:46:14,919
I know it's hard Gary...

601
00:46:14,921 --> 00:46:17,831
but you are still the only hope to stop these newer terrorists.

602
00:46:17,956 --> 00:46:20,737
Why me? Why am I the only one?

603
00:46:20,738 --> 00:46:22,752
Because you are the one with the power to do so.

604
00:46:22,752 --> 00:46:25,449
But I don't want the fucking power.

605
00:46:27,121 --> 00:46:28,045
I don't want the guilt!

606
00:46:28,046 --> 00:46:29,162
I don't want the shame and...

607
00:46:29,163 --> 00:46:31,396
I don't want the responsibility!

608
00:46:31,576 --> 00:46:33,746
Then what about all the things you promised last night?

609
00:46:34,397 --> 00:46:36,416
You said you'd never leave!

610
00:46:36,851 --> 00:46:40,687
I said I'd never die, but now I'm dead inside.

611
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:46,346
You slept with Gary?

612
00:46:46,346 --> 00:46:47,592
Sarah ...

613
00:46:47,593 --> 00:46:51,429
But you knew I liked Gary. I told you.

614
00:46:51,621 --> 00:46:55,457
You like Gary? Oh, I see...

615
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,622
I didn't plan on it happening Sarah.

616
00:46:58,623 --> 00:47:01,596
Save it Lisa.

617
00:47:01,596 --> 00:47:04,952
You see all I do is hurt people.

618
00:47:04,953 --> 00:47:06,499
Gary you didn't kill your brother!

619
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,858
Those gorillas did!

620
00:47:12,236 --> 00:47:15,023
I'm sorry I'm not the man you think I am.

621
00:47:15,024 --> 00:47:17,245
I'm just bad news.

622
00:47:18,273 --> 00:47:21,036
I'ill never act again.

623
00:47:27,684 --> 00:47:29,602
Fuck him! We don't need an actor.

624
00:47:29,602 --> 00:47:32,567
We can take out the Derkaderkastainies the old fashion way.

625
00:47:32,569 --> 00:47:34,836
No! It will be a suicide mission.

626
00:47:34,837 --> 00:47:36,046
That's all right...

627
00:47:36,047 --> 00:47:39,946
I feel a little bit like dying.

628
00:47:41,879 --> 00:47:45,715
God damn it Gary.

629
00:47:48,982 --> 00:47:54,060
# -America #
# -Fuck Yeah! #

630
00:47:54,061 --> 00:48:00,164
# Coming again to save the mother fucking day yeah~ #

631
00:48:00,166 --> 00:48:05,118
# -America #
# -Fuck Yeah! #

632
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:11,178
# Freedom is the only way yeah! #

633
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:15,664
# Terrorists your game is through~ #

634
00:48:15,666 --> 00:48:21,248
# 'cause now you have to answer to~ #

635
00:48:22,402 --> 00:48:27,080
# -America #
# -Fuck Yeah! #

636
00:48:27,082 --> 00:48:31,587
# -America #
# -Fuck... #

637
00:48:31,589 --> 00:48:36,627
Gary! Help me! Get this thing off me! Gary!

638
00:48:39,196 --> 00:48:41,849
All right team we are near Derkaderkastain!

639
00:48:42,633 --> 00:48:44,452
Let's get ready!

640
00:48:45,468 --> 00:48:48,294
Look out! We got terrorist aircraft.

641
00:48:53,716 --> 00:48:55,578
There is only 5 of them, team. This should be easy.

642
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:59,087
Korean aircraft at 1:00 o'clock.

643
00:48:59,088 --> 00:49:02,924
What are they doing here?

644
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:07,719
Shoot them down - like dogs.

645
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:11,556
Kim Jong-Il ... why is he helping terrorists?

646
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:19,992
I've got one on my tail.

647
00:49:21,215 --> 00:49:22,588
I got you Sarah!

648
00:49:27,083 --> 00:49:29,145
Bring in the submarines!

649
00:49:31,506 --> 00:49:32,872
What the hell?

650
00:49:32,873 --> 00:49:35,097
Somebody is shooting at us from the water!

651
00:49:35,098 --> 00:49:36,555
It must be a Korean sub.

652
00:49:36,738 --> 00:49:38,356
Chris you get to take him out.

653
00:49:38,357 --> 00:49:40,089
I am already on it.

654
00:49:46,253 --> 00:49:47,933
These guys really snuck up on us.

655
00:49:47,934 --> 00:49:50,433
Yeah there is a lot of that going around lately.

656
00:49:50,688 --> 00:49:53,085
Sarah you know I didn't mean to hurt you.

657
00:49:53,086 --> 00:49:56,922
No you just didn't care if you did.

658
00:49:56,923 --> 00:49:58,288
Now come on Sarah that isn't fair!

659
00:49:58,932 --> 00:50:01,401
Lisa can't help it if Gary has feelings for her.

660
00:50:01,622 --> 00:50:05,458
Just like nobody can help it if you have feelings for Gary.

661
00:50:08,733 --> 00:50:10,656
What is that supposed to mean?

662
00:50:10,915 --> 00:50:11,809
Oh come on Sarah!

663
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:14,308
You mean you never realized that Joe has feelings for you?

664
00:50:17,566 --> 00:50:20,545
Joe? But you're like a brother to me.

665
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:23,681
That's all I ever am ... like a brother.

666
00:50:23,681 --> 00:50:27,517
It isn't fair.

667
00:50:30,701 --> 00:50:32,890
Hang on team. Someone has broken into the hangar.

668
00:50:33,134 --> 00:50:34,052
Baxter?

669
00:50:34,172 --> 00:50:36,137
Hey Team America.

670
00:50:36,138 --> 00:50:38,029
I got something for you!

671
00:50:38,284 --> 00:50:39,680
What the hell?

672
00:50:39,796 --> 00:50:42,039
Prepare to die!

673
00:50:44,371 --> 00:50:52,217
Jesus titty fucking Christ!

674
00:50:52,647 --> 00:50:56,003
Spottswoode!

675
00:50:56,004 --> 00:50:57,458
Oh my god!

676
00:50:58,347 --> 00:50:59,499
No ...

677
00:50:59,744 --> 00:51:01,121
he can't be dead.

678
00:51:02,046 --> 00:51:03,676
We've lost Intelligence.

679
00:51:03,677 --> 00:51:06,554
I repeat ... we have no Intelligence.

680
00:51:06,554 --> 00:51:07,896
Their computers are down.

681
00:51:07,897 --> 00:51:11,733
Attack!

682
00:51:13,268 --> 00:51:14,514
Sarah!

683
00:51:14,515 --> 00:51:18,351
That's it I am going down.

684
00:51:18,255 --> 00:51:20,351
Sarah God! Chris you gotta help her!

685
00:51:20,353 --> 00:51:21,324
I am on it.

686
00:51:21,324 --> 00:51:22,666
Just hang on Sarah!

687
00:51:25,448 --> 00:51:27,845
Oh fuck, I've been hit.

688
00:51:27,846 --> 00:51:30,051
Chris, come in!

689
00:51:30,052 --> 00:51:31,586
Oh Jesus I am hit.

690
00:51:31,498 --> 00:51:32,180
Lisa!

691
00:51:32,181 --> 00:51:32,682
It's going down!

692
00:51:32,684 --> 00:51:34,653
God damn it. I am gonna to have to breach.

693
00:51:38,301 --> 00:51:41,370
I am going to hit the water.

694
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:43,384
Missile lock - I got missile lock!

695
00:51:43,384 --> 00:51:45,014
I gotta bail out!

696
00:51:45,014 --> 00:51:48,850
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

697
00:52:00,936 --> 00:52:02,164
Salvage that ships!

698
00:52:02,165 --> 00:52:06,207
- If you find anyone alive...you know what to do with them.
- Yeah!

699
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:11,390
Terrorist on screen.

700
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:15,130
Ok, who blew up Panama Canal?

701
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,337
We were angry about Cairo.

702
00:52:17,338 --> 00:52:19,351
God damn it how many times do I have to tell you.

703
00:52:19,352 --> 00:52:22,324
you don't use the WMDs until you see the signal.

704
00:52:22,325 --> 00:52:23,976
I've woked 10 years on this plan.

705
00:52:24,259 --> 00:52:27,023
And it's a very precise and a complicated plan.

706
00:52:27,024 --> 00:52:28,994
I am sick of you terrorist fucking it up.

707
00:52:28,995 --> 00:52:30,868
Now take the weapons where I told you...

708
00:52:30,869 --> 00:52:33,097
and wait for the God damn signal this time!

709
00:52:33,098 --> 00:52:34,734
Good bye!

710
00:52:36,135 --> 00:52:39,971
Why is everyone so fucking stupid?

711
00:52:40,163 --> 00:52:43,999
Why aren't there more people intelligent like me?

712
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:47,248
I am ... so ...

713
00:52:47,249 --> 00:52:49,449
# lonely~ #

714
00:52:49,451 --> 00:52:51,330
# so lonely~ #

715
00:52:51,331 --> 00:52:55,217
# so lonely and sadly alone~ #

716
00:52:55,219 --> 00:52:59,266
# get no one, just me only~ #

717
00:52:59,267 --> 00:53:02,945
# sitting on my little throne~ #

718
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:07,392
# I work very hard and make out great plans~ #

719
00:53:07,394 --> 00:53:11,588
# but nobody listens no one understands~ #

720
00:53:11,589 --> 00:53:17,865
# seems like no one takes me seriously~ #

721
00:53:17,866 --> 00:53:21,796
# and so...I'm lonely~ #

722
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:24,903
# eheh, a little lonely ... #

723
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:31,270
# poor little me~ #

724
00:53:35,084 --> 00:53:39,392
# there's no body, I can relate to~ #

725
00:53:39,394 --> 00:53:43,062
# feel like a bird in the cage~ #

726
00:53:43,063 --> 00:53:46,887
# it's kind of silly, but not reary~ #

727
00:53:46,889 --> 00:53:50,983
# because it's filling my body with rage~ #

728
00:53:51,367 --> 00:53:55,399
# I'm the smartest, most clever and most physically fit!~ #

729
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:59,477
# but no body else seems to realize it~ #

730
00:53:59,478 --> 00:54:05,856
# when I changed the world maybe they'll notice me~ #

731
00:54:05,858 --> 00:54:07,185
# and until then #

732
00:54:07,186 --> 00:54:09,829
# I'll just be lonely~ #

733
00:54:10,944 --> 00:54:13,871
# yeah...a little lonely #

734
00:54:13,872 --> 00:54:19,769
# poor little me~ #

735
00:54:22,707 --> 00:54:30,651
# I'm...so ... lonely~ #

736
00:54:44,589 --> 00:54:46,429
# what would you do~ #

737
00:54:46,431 --> 00:54:50,688
# if you were asked to give up your dreams for freedom~ #

738
00:54:51,823 --> 00:54:55,075
# what would you do,If asked to make the ultimate sacrifice~ #

739
00:54:55,566 --> 00:54:58,468
Hey weren't you the actor in that Broadway show?

740
00:54:58,468 --> 00:55:02,304
Hey yeah it is you do that scene where everyone gets AIDS.

741
00:55:02,688 --> 00:55:06,428
I don't act anymore. I gave that up.

742
00:55:06,429 --> 00:55:07,484
Oh come on man. Just a scene.

743
00:55:07,484 --> 00:55:13,392
I said get away from me. I am completely lost.
I've hit rock bottom.

744
00:55:13,526 --> 00:55:16,347
Easy, easy ho. You gotta calm down there Chuck.

745
00:55:16,349 --> 00:55:19,065
I hurt people. I am a dick.

746
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:22,012
Oh, being a dick isn't so bad.

747
00:55:22,013 --> 00:55:26,258
There are three kinds of people. Dicks, pussies, and assholes.

748
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:28,311
Pussies think everyone can get alone.

749
00:55:28,313 --> 00:55:31,366
And dicks just want to fuck all the time without thinking it through.

750
00:55:31,653 --> 00:55:33,760
But then you get your assholes Chuck!

751
00:55:33,761 --> 00:55:37,417
And all the assholes want is to shit all over everything.

752
00:55:37,887 --> 00:55:40,346
So pussies may get mad at dicks once in a while

753
00:55:40,348 --> 00:55:43,034
because pussies get fucked by dicks.

754
00:55:43,354 --> 00:55:46,806
But dicks also fuck assholes, Chuck.

755
00:55:46,807 --> 00:55:49,492
And if they didn't fuck the assholes you know what you get?

756
00:55:49,493 --> 00:55:53,329
You get your dick and your pussy all covered in shit.

757
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:58,220
All right that does it. Get out of here you drunk low life!

758
00:56:04,263 --> 00:56:08,099
Get out of here I said!

759
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:21,045
Lisa! Lisa? Lisa are you here?

760
00:56:21,846 --> 00:56:24,323
Get out of the street you fuking bum!

761
00:56:29,647 --> 00:56:32,233
You gave up on life didn't you?

762
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:53,473
My fellow actors!

763
00:57:53,475 --> 00:57:55,400
We live in a dark time.

764
00:57:55,402 --> 00:57:57,851
The world is becoming more and more violent

765
00:57:57,964 --> 00:58:00,204
and the idoits in charge are making it worse.

766
00:58:00,206 --> 00:58:03,868
What the world needs is an international advisory committee

767
00:58:03,870 --> 00:58:06,577
who truly understands global politics.

768
00:58:06,838 --> 00:58:11,128
- Namely ... us.
- erg!erg!erg!

769
00:58:11,626 --> 00:58:15,470
The time has come for us to start using our acting talents in a different way.

770
00:58:15,854 --> 00:58:19,221
Yes we can use our powers to change the world.

771
00:58:19,222 --> 00:58:21,947
erg!erg!erg!

772
00:58:21,949 --> 00:58:25,487
We'll persuvade everyone to drive hybrid cars and stop smoking.

773
00:58:25,488 --> 00:58:28,154
If we focus our acting on global politics

774
00:58:28,155 --> 00:58:30,209
we can change everything and stuff!

775
00:58:30,211 --> 00:58:33,227
erg!erg!erg!

776
00:58:33,414 --> 00:58:37,433
As actors it's our responsibility to read the newspapers

777
00:58:37,434 --> 00:58:41,270
and then say what we read on television like it's our own opinion.

778
00:58:41,846 --> 00:58:43,329
Matt Damon

779
00:58:43,735 --> 00:58:45,269
We'll all done action films.

780
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:46,916
If anyone tries to get in our way

781
00:58:46,917 --> 00:58:49,191
we'll show them how tough we actors really are.

782
00:58:49,193 --> 00:58:53,926
erg!erg!erg!

783
00:58:53,927 --> 00:58:56,064
I am glad you all agree

784
00:58:56,066 --> 00:58:59,764
because I've just been contacted by a very important political leader

785
00:58:59,765 --> 00:59:02,373
who has bringing all the world leaders together

786
00:59:02,375 --> 00:59:05,191
for a massive international peace conference

787
00:59:05,192 --> 00:59:08,988
and he wants us to be the keynote speakers.

788
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:11,692
erg!erg!erg!

789
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:13,532
Matt Damon!

790
00:59:13,534 --> 00:59:15,274
erg!erg!erg!

791
00:59:15,276 --> 00:59:18,119
Say hello to our new partner!

792
00:59:18,153 --> 00:59:20,630
Hello?

793
00:59:20,631 --> 00:59:24,498
erg!erg!erg!

794
00:59:28,746 --> 00:59:32,626
Stop it! Stop it! You are killing him.

795
00:59:33,062 --> 00:59:35,363
I am gonna fucking kill you.

796
00:59:35,364 --> 00:59:37,529
You are not in the position to kill anyone,

797
00:59:37,531 --> 00:59:40,070
my red, white and blue friend.

798
00:59:40,831 --> 00:59:44,609
So you are the bastard planning 911 times a thousand.

799
00:59:44,668 --> 00:59:46,929
No, you think so small.

800
00:59:46,930 --> 00:59:51,047
You see, I am about to have an elaborate peace ceremony!

801
00:59:51,282 --> 00:59:55,314
And while all the world's most important peoples are distracted here

802
00:59:55,506 --> 00:59:57,711
I will detonate the WMDs

803
00:59:57,712 --> 01:00:01,548
which I have given to terrorists all around the globe.

804
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:06,727
It will be 911 times 2356.

805
01:00:08,933 --> 01:00:12,769
My god! That's...I don't even know what that is.

806
01:00:13,441 --> 01:00:15,455
Nobody does.

807
01:00:15,455 --> 01:00:16,701
You heartless bastard!

808
01:00:16,702 --> 01:00:18,236
Why would you do such a thing.

809
01:00:18,237 --> 01:00:20,116
Because then I will be balance!

810
01:00:20,118 --> 01:00:22,805
Every country will be a Third World country!

811
01:00:23,009 --> 01:00:27,156
Just imagine it. All around the world there will be massive explosions.

812
01:00:28,595 --> 01:00:31,760
With nobody to guide them the people will break out into panic and

813
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:36,963
rioting all over the earth the true nature of humanity is unleashed.

814
01:00:37,345 --> 01:00:42,107
Dog eats dog as everyone attacks everyone and feds only for themselves.

815
01:00:42,406 --> 01:00:44,899
Global stability unravels.

816
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:48,736
By the time my show is over it will be far too late.

817
01:00:56,314 --> 01:00:57,173
Your plan will fail!

818
01:00:57,174 --> 01:01:00,632
You will never keep the world leaders distracted here for 9 hours!

819
01:01:00,763 --> 01:01:02,164
Oh no?

820
01:01:02,164 --> 01:01:06,000
I've got Alec Baldwin.

821
01:01:06,192 --> 01:01:07,811
Damn god!

822
01:01:07,813 --> 01:01:10,699
You are the rest of a dying breed ...

823
01:01:10,616 --> 01:01:13,385
the flag waving Americans.

824
01:01:13,386 --> 01:01:17,222
Well your little dream will soon be over.

825
01:01:17,414 --> 01:01:20,195
I must get back planning the ceremony now.

826
01:01:20,196 --> 01:01:21,907
The film actors are on their way.

827
01:01:21,908 --> 01:01:25,145
Perhaps they'll stop in and say hello!

828
01:01:26,895 --> 01:01:31,891
Having so little faith in humanity must make you a very lonely man.

829
01:01:39,014 --> 01:01:41,871
You shall have a front row seat.

830
01:01:41,872 --> 01:01:44,077
Bring her upstairs!

831
01:01:44,077 --> 01:01:46,282
Leave her alone you son of a bitch!

832
01:01:46,283 --> 01:01:50,119
Lisa, I treasure your friendship.

833
01:01:50,695 --> 01:01:53,936
Ah! Somebody has to stop this.

834
01:02:00,001 --> 01:02:04,424
# I miss you more than Michael Bay missed the mark #

835
01:02:04,425 --> 01:02:07,620
# When he made Pearl Harbor #

836
01:02:07,622 --> 01:02:12,305
# I miss you more than that movie missed the point #

837
01:02:12,306 --> 01:02:16,251
# And that's an awful lot girl, and now~ #

838
01:02:16,253 --> 01:02:18,858
# now you've gone away~ #

839
01:02:20,247 --> 01:02:22,850
# All I'm trying to say~ #

840
01:02:22,851 --> 01:02:25,208
# is Pearl Harbor sucked #

841
01:02:25,209 --> 01:02:29,216
# and I missed you~ #

842
01:02:31,635 --> 01:02:35,887
# I need you like Ben Affleck needs acting school~ #

843
01:02:35,889 --> 01:02:39,128
# He was terrible in that film! #

844
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:43,597
# I need you like Cuba Gooding needed a bigger part~ #

845
01:02:44,372 --> 01:02:48,039
# He's way better than Ben Affleck and now~ #

846
01:02:48,041 --> 01:02:51,364
# all I can think about is your smiles~ #

847
01:02:51,365 --> 01:02:54,295
# and that shitty movie too~ #

848
01:02:54,296 --> 01:02:56,674
# Pearl Harbour sucked~ #

849
01:02:57,132 --> 01:03:01,076
# and I miss you~ #

850
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:05,837
# Pearl Harbour sucked~ #

851
01:03:07,501 --> 01:03:13,282
# just a little bit more than I miss you~ #

852
01:03:13,755 --> 01:03:17,591
Oh my god! What the hell happened?

853
01:03:35,335 --> 01:03:39,171
Hello anybody?

854
01:03:40,074 --> 01:03:42,776
Greetings Mr. Johnston.

855
01:03:42,978 --> 01:03:45,117
Intelligence what the hell happened?

856
01:03:45,118 --> 01:03:48,954
Our base was attacked by a giant socialist weasel.

857
01:03:49,434 --> 01:03:50,724
But where is the team?

858
01:03:50,725 --> 01:03:55,128
They have been taken prisoner by Kim Jong-Il in North Korea.

859
01:03:55,129 --> 01:03:57,323
I have intercepted communications that...

860
01:03:57,324 --> 01:04:00,742
he is planning the massive attack during a peace ceremony.

861
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:04,396
Don't move protestor or I will blow your commy brains out.

862
01:04:04,396 --> 01:04:05,930
Spottswoode?

863
01:04:05,931 --> 01:04:07,020
Johnston?

864
01:04:07,598 --> 01:04:08,889
What the hell are you doing here?

865
01:04:08,891 --> 01:04:10,268
Get away from Intelligence!

866
01:04:10,438 --> 01:04:12,661
I am using it to blow up North Korea.

867
01:04:12,663 --> 01:04:14,563
No! The team is in North Korea.

868
01:04:14,563 --> 01:04:18,622
I know and so are the triggers to WMDs poised all around the globle

869
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:21,559
My only opinion now is to blow up Kim Jong-Il...

870
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:23,703
and everything around him before he can set them off.

871
01:04:24,201 --> 01:04:27,062
Intelligence, initiate detonation sequences on the ships.

872
01:04:27,127 --> 01:04:28,431
You'll kill them all!

873
01:04:28,678 --> 01:04:30,497
It's what they would want me to do Gary!

874
01:04:30,846 --> 01:04:31,984
They would happily give their lives...

875
01:04:31,986 --> 01:04:34,283
for the good of the world - something you don't understand.

876
01:04:34,512 --> 01:04:35,803
There has to be another way.

877
01:04:36,162 --> 01:04:38,544
There is nobody left to stop Kim Jong-Il.

878
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,231
Let me go!

879
01:04:42,102 --> 01:04:45,159
You? You are a butt fucking quitter!

880
01:04:45,446 --> 01:04:46,697
You walked out Gary.

881
01:04:46,789 --> 01:04:47,817
The team went on a mission without you and...

882
01:04:47,818 --> 01:04:49,726
without an actor they were like pigs to the slaughter.

883
01:04:49,728 --> 01:04:52,521
I am suppose to leave the fate of the world in your hands?

884
01:04:52,522 --> 01:04:54,932
I know I walked out but I'd do anything to take it back!

885
01:04:54,934 --> 01:04:56,555
Please just let me help!

886
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:58,465
You've done enough

887
01:04:58,573 --> 01:05:01,387
Please! Spottswoode you have to believe in me!

888
01:05:03,669 --> 01:05:05,970
I want to believe in you Gary.

889
01:05:05,971 --> 01:05:07,505
I really do.

890
01:05:07,506 --> 01:05:10,671
But you've let me down before.

891
01:05:10,671 --> 01:05:14,507
Please! How can I make you trust me?

892
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:17,876
I remembered the first time we met.

893
01:05:17,878 --> 01:05:20,366
You were a simple Broadway actor afraid to get in my limo

894
01:05:20,367 --> 01:05:23,658
because you thought I wanted you to perform oral sex on me.

895
01:05:23,948 --> 01:05:26,191
Do you remember that?

896
01:05:26,208 --> 01:05:27,708
Yeah

897
01:05:28,283 --> 01:05:30,277
But now the tables are turned

898
01:05:30,279 --> 01:05:33,040
and I don't know if I can trust you.

899
01:05:34,685 --> 01:05:38,045
Just give me a chance.

900
01:05:40,669 --> 01:05:43,633
Alright! I will trust you...

901
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:48,749
but only if you will perform oral sex on me.

902
01:05:50,405 --> 01:05:51,337
What?

903
01:05:51,337 --> 01:05:55,173
Right here, right now.

904
01:05:55,749 --> 01:05:57,091
You can't be serious.

905
01:05:57,092 --> 01:05:58,818
Oh I am serious.

906
01:05:58,818 --> 01:06:02,654
Look, this is my serious face.

907
01:06:03,998 --> 01:06:04,749
What will that prove?

908
01:06:04,882 --> 01:06:07,738
It will prove that you are truly ready to lay everything on the line

909
01:06:07,739 --> 01:06:10,096
To throw away all you innervations and get 100 percent

910
01:06:10,098 --> 01:06:11,625
We must go back to the first night we met

911
01:06:11,671 --> 01:06:13,589
that first issue of trust. Don't you see?

912
01:06:13,589 --> 01:06:15,699
No, I thought you weren't gay.

913
01:06:15,699 --> 01:06:18,480
This isn't about sex Gary ... it's about trust!

914
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:19,595
It is the eye of the needle Gary!

915
01:06:19,597 --> 01:06:21,156
And we must both pass through it.

916
01:06:26,249 --> 01:06:30,085
Ok, let's do it.

917
01:06:30,469 --> 01:06:32,315
Ah, make sure nobody is watching.

918
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:34,320
Yeah, looks clear.

919
01:06:34,882 --> 01:06:37,277
Ok, go!

920
01:06:37,847 --> 01:06:39,549
There must be another way

921
01:06:39,550 --> 01:06:41,494
Huh, I guess you won't do everything ...

922
01:06:41,495 --> 01:06:43,279
to take it all back, will you Gary?

923
01:06:43,417 --> 01:06:45,814
No, no, no ... wait ... hold on!

924
01:06:45,815 --> 01:06:49,651
You are saying if I do that you'll let me help the team?

925
01:06:50,802 --> 01:06:54,638
I will give you all the time I can!

926
01:06:56,269 --> 01:06:58,954
Ok, let's do it!

927
01:06:58,955 --> 01:07:00,969
Here we go.

928
01:07:00,969 --> 01:07:04,805
And go!

929
01:07:30,257 --> 01:07:34,233
You are dedicated. Now let's go get cleaned up!

930
01:07:34,234 --> 01:07:36,675
If you are going to storm Kim Jong-Il's palace single-handed...

931
01:07:36,677 --> 01:07:39,653
we have to make you a complete solider in very little time.

932
01:07:40,730 --> 01:07:42,440
How we gonna do that?

933
01:07:42,693 --> 01:07:46,814
I think I know just what we need.

934
01:07:49,795 --> 01:07:55,429
# The hours approaching, just give it your best.
You got to reach your prime. #

935
01:07:55,430 --> 01:07:58,614
# That's when you need to put yourself to the test #

936
01:07:58,616 --> 01:08:00,927
# and show us a passage of time~ #

937
01:08:00,928 --> 01:08:04,509
# We're going to need a montage~ #
# -montage~ #

938
01:08:04,510 --> 01:08:07,927
# - wu~ it takes a montage~ #
# - montage~ #

939
01:08:07,929 --> 01:08:10,633
# Sure a lot of things happening at once #

940
01:08:10,634 --> 01:08:14,236
# - With mind, everyone what's going on~ #
# - what's going on? #

941
01:08:14,238 --> 01:08:17,004
# And whith every shot you show a little improvement~ #

942
01:08:17,005 --> 01:08:19,230
# Just Show it or it will take to long~ #

943
01:08:19,231 --> 01:08:22,897
# - that's called a montage~ #
# - montage~ #

944
01:08:22,899 --> 01:08:26,372
# - Here we want montage~ #
# - montage~ #

945
01:08:26,373 --> 01:08:29,046
# And anything that we want to know~ #

946
01:08:29,047 --> 01:08:32,120
# from just a beginner to a pro~ #

947
01:08:32,122 --> 01:08:34,422
# - You need a montage~ #
# - montage~ #

948
01:08:34,424 --> 01:08:38,386
# - even rocky had a montage~ #
# - montage~ #

949
01:08:38,387 --> 01:08:44,149
# - Always fade out in a montage~ #
# - montage~ #

950
01:08:44,151 --> 01:08:50,927
# - If you fade out, it seem like more time has passed in a montage~ #
# - montage~ #

951
01:09:00,858 --> 01:09:02,776
Ladies and gentlemen ...

952
01:09:02,777 --> 01:09:05,709
the Film Actor Guild and Kim Jong-Il are pleased...

953
01:09:05,711 --> 01:09:10,928
to welcome you to the international world peace ceremony.

954
01:09:12,533 --> 01:09:14,724
The most important people form every country

955
01:09:14,725 --> 01:09:18,991
are gathered here in solidarity to celebrate peace.

956
01:09:19,354 --> 01:09:21,853
There will be music, dancing, and of course...

957
01:09:21,854 --> 01:09:24,374
the biggest stars in Hollywood!

958
01:09:24,836 --> 01:09:28,672
In the box to your left is the mastermind to this spectacular show.

959
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:32,796
The multi-talented Kim Jong-Il

960
01:09:32,797 --> 01:09:35,494
Hello, hello.

961
01:09:35,983 --> 01:09:40,086
And now we present you the very best in Northern Korean Music.

962
01:09:58,981 --> 01:10:02,204
10 years of planning and finally the night is here.

963
01:10:02,205 --> 01:10:03,809
The terrorists know to be in position...

964
01:10:03,811 --> 01:10:06,170
by the time Alec Baldwin takes the stage.

965
01:10:06,406 --> 01:10:10,298
That's when I trigger all the WMDs to go up at the same time.

966
01:10:10,418 --> 01:10:12,044
When you see Alec Baldwin...

967
01:10:12,046 --> 01:10:15,980
You will see the true ugliness of human nature.

968
01:10:16,641 --> 01:10:19,568
Your plan will never work. Something will stop it.

969
01:10:20,741 --> 01:10:23,619
You stupid naive team Americans ...

970
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:25,517
You believe in true ravin happy endings...

971
01:10:25,518 --> 01:10:28,588
even while the world around you spirals downward!

972
01:10:29,412 --> 01:10:33,507
Sometimes believing is all we have.

973
01:10:35,302 --> 01:10:37,418
And as the leaders of your countries ...

974
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:39,584
you have the power to bring the world together...

975
01:10:39,586 --> 01:10:43,140
under the principles of the Film Actors Guild.

976
01:10:43,396 --> 01:10:46,655
You're gonna to knock 'em dead Alec.

977
01:10:46,655 --> 01:10:49,420
10 minutes Mr. Baldwin

978
01:10:58,833 --> 01:11:00,440
Who the hell are you?

979
01:11:00,582 --> 01:11:02,257
I am with the Film Actors Guild

980
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:03,816
here to help the broadcast

981
01:11:03,817 --> 01:11:05,543
Then you show credentials?

982
01:11:05,543 --> 01:11:07,535
Hey! You don't need to see my credentials.

983
01:11:07,653 --> 01:11:09,628
I left them at home and I am running late.

984
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:11,879
I believe him.

985
01:11:11,914 --> 01:11:13,145
Yeah, me too!

986
01:11:13,312 --> 01:11:15,191
Ok let him go.

987
01:11:15,481 --> 01:11:18,686
My god, his acting is better than ever.

988
01:11:33,166 --> 01:11:37,002
Don't worry fellas, I've got my pass right here!

989
01:11:45,978 --> 01:11:47,756
Please Mr. Sheen and Mr. Robbins ...

990
01:11:47,757 --> 01:11:49,950
you don't understand what Kim Jong-Il is doing!

991
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:53,554
Shut up we have explicit instructions to watch you.

992
01:11:53,556 --> 01:11:55,741
Yeah! we are supposed to be guards.

993
01:11:55,742 --> 01:11:56,616
We are guards.

994
01:11:56,618 --> 01:11:58,656
Guards, we are guards.

995
01:11:58,657 --> 01:12:00,404
We are guards.

996
01:12:00,405 --> 01:12:03,570
Mr. Sheen, Mr. Robbins! Someone has broken into the main hall.

997
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:04,337
What?

998
01:12:04,337 --> 01:12:08,173
Come on Martin!

999
01:12:16,038 --> 01:12:17,284
Gary?

1000
01:12:17,285 --> 01:12:18,819
What the fuck are you doing here?

1001
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:19,875
Guys, you're all right?

1002
01:12:19,875 --> 01:12:21,505
Where is Lisa?

1003
01:12:21,505 --> 01:12:23,902
What the heck do you care? You walked out on her.

1004
01:12:23,903 --> 01:12:25,437
Look, I wanna make things right.

1005
01:12:25,438 --> 01:12:27,260
Here, Spottswoode's monitoring from the base.

1006
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:28,986
Spottswoode is dead Gary.

1007
01:12:28,986 --> 01:12:30,328
Not as dead as you think.

1008
01:12:30,329 --> 01:12:31,288
Spottswoode

1009
01:12:31,288 --> 01:12:33,589
Yes I am here, Joe.

1010
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:35,412
All right you are alive.

1011
01:12:35,412 --> 01:12:37,138
Great to hear your voices again.

1012
01:12:37,139 --> 01:12:39,632
Now we've got to get Lisa and stop Kim Jong-Il.

1013
01:12:39,632 --> 01:12:41,532
I am not going anywhere with this fucking traitor.

1014
01:12:41,533 --> 01:12:43,982
Yeah! What makes you think we'll take your backing? Douchebag?

1015
01:12:44,017 --> 01:12:45,171
We are doing this without you.

1016
01:12:45,290 --> 01:12:46,566
Now hold on team!

1017
01:12:46,568 --> 01:12:50,278
Gary has already proven to me that he is 100% committed to the team.

1018
01:12:50,279 --> 01:12:53,356
He proved it last night by sucking my cock.

1019
01:12:56,914 --> 01:13:00,925
All right...come on team we got to find that stage!

1020
01:13:00,925 --> 01:13:02,555
Look how much they love my show!

1021
01:13:02,555 --> 01:13:06,391
The entire audience is so captivated!

1022
01:13:11,955 --> 01:13:15,791
Now you see the new world is inevitable.

1023
01:13:16,079 --> 01:13:17,613
It's what?

1024
01:13:17,613 --> 01:13:19,627
Inev...inevitable...

1025
01:13:19,628 --> 01:13:20,491
One more time?

1026
01:13:20,491 --> 01:13:21,546
Inevitable!

1027
01:13:21,546 --> 01:13:24,231
Things are inevitably going to change!

1028
01:13:24,231 --> 01:13:26,685
God damn it! Open your fucking ears!

1029
01:13:28,664 --> 01:13:29,910
5 minutes Mr. Baldwin.

1030
01:13:30,049 --> 01:13:31,227
Thank you!

1031
01:13:31,229 --> 01:13:32,625
Alec! We have a problem!

1032
01:13:33,124 --> 01:13:34,919
Team America escaped.

1033
01:13:35,631 --> 01:13:36,411
What?

1034
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:38,522
You fools they'll ruin everything

1035
01:13:38,522 --> 01:13:41,090
We better warn everyone they will be headed here.

1036
01:13:41,092 --> 01:13:44,016
No! We can't look weak and powerless!

1037
01:13:44,017 --> 01:13:47,119
If violence is all those bastards understand then violence they'll get.

1038
01:13:47,416 --> 01:13:49,422
Every actor grab a gun and keep Team America...

1039
01:13:49,423 --> 01:13:51,675
from reaching this ceremony at all costs!

1040
01:13:56,621 --> 01:13:59,721
I swear they won't reach the stage.

1041
01:14:16,503 --> 01:14:17,411
Jesus!

1042
01:14:17,666 --> 01:14:18,440
What have we got?

1043
01:14:18,517 --> 01:14:21,241
Looks like George Clooney and Liv Tyler, 20 yards.

1044
01:14:22,819 --> 01:14:25,353
Look out, Ethan Hawke and Janeane Garofalo.

1045
01:14:30,941 --> 01:14:32,074
Drop your weapon!

1046
01:14:32,674 --> 01:14:34,331
Fucking die!

1047
01:14:36,591 --> 01:14:37,615
Got to split up!

1048
01:14:37,616 --> 01:14:38,718
Sarah you and Gary go that way!

1049
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,721
Chris and I will go right.

1050
01:14:39,722 --> 01:14:43,572
No I think I'd rather team up with you Joe.

1051
01:14:44,924 --> 01:14:47,125
I guess you are with me cock fag.

1052
01:14:49,113 --> 01:14:49,928
Danny Glover

1053
01:14:49,929 --> 01:14:52,211
Come on Penn we must protect the show!

1054
01:14:52,245 --> 01:14:53,388
Right!

1055
01:14:54,141 --> 01:14:55,347
The stage must be that way-

1056
01:14:55,347 --> 01:14:59,183
No Joe, Sarah it's a trap!

1057
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:04,842
Very impressive war mongers.

1058
01:15:04,842 --> 01:15:08,678
Now let's see how Kim Jong-Il's panthers treat you.

1059
01:15:12,228 --> 01:15:16,064
I went to Iraq you know?

1060
01:15:19,610 --> 01:15:20,615
Susan Sarandon

1061
01:15:21,162 --> 01:15:23,545
Oh thank god. We have to stop the ceremony!

1062
01:15:23,545 --> 01:15:24,887
Kim Jong-Il is mad!

1063
01:15:24,888 --> 01:15:27,093
Here let me loose. I will show you where the theater is!

1064
01:15:27,094 --> 01:15:28,244
All right!

1065
01:15:28,245 --> 01:15:29,683
No! Chris stay away from her!

1066
01:15:29,684 --> 01:15:30,355
Fuck you!

1067
01:15:30,355 --> 01:15:31,410
She wants to help us.

1068
01:15:31,410 --> 01:15:32,752
No Chris.

1069
01:15:32,753 --> 01:15:33,712
She is acting.

1070
01:15:33,712 --> 01:15:36,109
I am not.

1071
01:15:36,110 --> 01:15:38,892
The others tied me up because I won't go along with their plans!

1072
01:15:38,893 --> 01:15:41,384
Your skills are fading with age, Miss Sarandon.

1073
01:15:43,006 --> 01:15:46,852
You shall die a peasant's death!

1074
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:56,634
Jesus titty fucking Christ!

1075
01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:58,649
I could have sworn she was telling the truth!

1076
01:15:58,649 --> 01:16:00,183
That's why they call it acting.

1077
01:16:00,183 --> 01:16:02,551
Come on, we gotta find Lisa.

1078
01:16:02,552 --> 01:16:06,513
I was 19 year old when the musical Cats came to our town.

1079
01:16:06,705 --> 01:16:09,774
I couldn't wait to see it.

1080
01:16:09,775 --> 01:16:11,675
After the show I was asked if I wanted to go meet...

1081
01:16:11,675 --> 01:16:13,527
some of the performers backstage.

1082
01:16:14,186 --> 01:16:15,816
Man I was thrilled.

1083
01:16:15,817 --> 01:16:17,422
But when I get back there ...

1084
01:16:17,423 --> 01:16:20,149
they were drunk and out of control.

1085
01:16:20,421 --> 01:16:23,873
Rumpus Cat and Macavity kept feeling up my leg.

1086
01:16:23,626 --> 01:16:26,668
I tried to leave but Rumpleteaser held me down and...

1087
01:16:28,458 --> 01:16:32,762
I was raped by Mr.Mistoffeles.

1088
01:16:35,213 --> 01:16:39,046
That's why you don't trust actors.

1089
01:16:41,035 --> 01:16:43,439
I am sorry I've been so hard on you.

1090
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:45,339
If there is still a world left after this is all over

1091
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:47,971
I'd like to buy you are a beer.

1092
01:16:50,568 --> 01:16:54,306
Come on let's go! We are running out of time.

1093
01:16:56,728 --> 01:17:00,703
Sarah, before we die I want to finally tell you that I love you.

1094
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:05,786
No no I am not going to let it end like this!

1095
01:17:06,170 --> 01:17:09,754
We are not your enemy, furry ones. You will not attack us.

1096
01:17:09,756 --> 01:17:11,316
Sarah, that isn't going to work.

1097
01:17:11,317 --> 01:17:13,518
You don't really have mental powers.

1098
01:17:13,519 --> 01:17:15,629
Your captors are behind you Shibas.

1099
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:17,644
Show your anger to them.

1100
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:31,586
Oh no.

1101
01:17:31,587 --> 01:17:35,423
No, no.

1102
01:17:37,917 --> 01:17:41,753
Sarah you did it.

1103
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,397
Wait! Hold on!

1104
01:17:45,398 --> 01:17:47,795
Spottswoode, I think we just found the entrance to the theater.

1105
01:17:47,796 --> 01:17:49,290
Have Sarah and Joe lock on...Oh!

1106
01:17:50,443 --> 01:17:51,032
Gary

1107
01:17:51,249 --> 01:17:52,846
Huh, I guess you won't do everything ...

1108
01:17:53,071 --> 01:17:54,413
Actors, halt!

1109
01:17:54,414 --> 01:17:55,756
Helen Hunt

1110
01:17:55,757 --> 01:17:57,387
Samuel L. Jackson

1111
01:17:57,387 --> 01:18:00,397
Matt Damon

1112
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:02,123
Motherfucker!

1113
01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:06,084
Gary, Chris, come in!

1114
01:18:07,837 --> 01:18:12,445
And now Ladies and Gentlemen ... Mr. Alec Baldwin.

1115
01:18:24,028 --> 01:18:26,756
We are here to usher in a new era without violence.

1116
01:18:26,757 --> 01:18:29,414
By following the rules of the Film Actors Guild

1117
01:18:29,416 --> 01:18:31,819
the world can become a better place

1118
01:18:31,819 --> 01:18:35,557
that handles dangerous people with talk and reasoning

1119
01:18:35,848 --> 01:18:39,321
That is the FAG way.

1120
01:18:39,322 --> 01:18:43,521
One day you will look at the world that us actors created and say:

1121
01:18:43,617 --> 01:18:49,438
"Wa, good going FAG! You really made the world a better place.

1122
01:18:49,467 --> 01:18:51,155
Didn't you FAG?

1123
01:18:51,156 --> 01:18:53,399
Yeah, Alec Baldwin.

1124
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,796
Too bad there won't be a world left.

1125
01:18:55,797 --> 01:18:57,648
Oh god, no!

1126
01:18:57,780 --> 01:19:02,319
You see, no prince charming rode in on a white stallion to save the day.

1127
01:19:02,759 --> 01:19:04,410
This is the real world.

1128
01:19:05,325 --> 01:19:09,284
I am afraid your world is over ...

1129
01:19:09,285 --> 01:19:10,883
In 5 minutes!

1130
01:19:13,642 --> 01:19:16,418
Yes the ticking clock.

1131
01:19:18,279 --> 01:19:22,460
Sorry Team America but you see ... we must live in a time of peace.

1132
01:19:22,936 --> 01:19:25,300
Put down the gas can now!

1133
01:19:25,526 --> 01:19:26,972
Kill them!

1134
01:19:30,893 --> 01:19:32,754
Jackson

1135
01:19:34,833 --> 01:19:38,669
Team, you've got to hurry.

1136
01:19:42,602 --> 01:19:45,191
Let's go bitch! I've done action films.

1137
01:19:45,192 --> 01:19:49,028
Come on!

1138
01:20:07,866 --> 01:20:09,630
Matt Damon

1139
01:20:19,725 --> 01:20:22,804
Come on! Stop trying to hit me and hit me!

1140
01:20:28,704 --> 01:20:30,767
Don't fucking move!

1141
01:20:31,027 --> 01:20:35,257
Now isn't that a shame? You came so close to stopping peace ...

1142
01:20:35,353 --> 01:20:38,326
but you see peace always finds a way.

1143
01:20:38,327 --> 01:20:40,160
Goodbye Team America.

1144
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:43,364
I've just got one piece of bad news for you Robbins.

1145
01:20:43,366 --> 01:20:45,328
What's that?

1146
01:20:45,328 --> 01:20:49,164
I am a smoker.

1147
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:05,912
Now that the world is going to be run peacefully ...

1148
01:21:05,914 --> 01:21:08,467
we should all drive hybird cars.

1149
01:21:08,467 --> 01:21:10,575
Right now families are gathering in parks,

1150
01:21:10,576 --> 01:21:12,332
children are walking to school,

1151
01:21:12,471 --> 01:21:14,264
friends are sitting in movie theaters.

1152
01:21:14,266 --> 01:21:18,415
all completely unaware that the world is about to change forever.

1153
01:21:18,831 --> 01:21:21,048
All because of me!

1154
01:21:23,225 --> 01:21:26,570
Stop that man!

1155
01:21:26,570 --> 01:21:28,296
Gary

1156
01:21:28,297 --> 01:21:29,735
Team America?

1157
01:21:29,735 --> 01:21:31,077
God damn it!

1158
01:21:31,078 --> 01:21:32,476
Sorry to interrupt the show everyone

1159
01:21:32,477 --> 01:21:34,280
but Kim Jong-Il is an international criminal!

1160
01:21:34,281 --> 01:21:35,773
We are here to arrest him!

1161
01:21:35,775 --> 01:21:37,409
Oh no you are not!

1162
01:21:37,410 --> 01:21:41,628
This is a peace conference and if you even try to touch Kim Jong-Il,

1163
01:21:42,683 --> 01:21:46,519
this audience and I will rise up against you.

1164
01:21:49,722 --> 01:21:50,588
Team there is no time!

1165
01:21:50,589 --> 01:21:53,629
You have to convince that audience to let you do your job!

1166
01:21:55,919 --> 01:21:58,018
Gary you've got to take the stage.

1167
01:21:58,062 --> 01:22:00,292
No, I can't upstage Alec Baldwin...

1168
01:22:00,294 --> 01:22:01,868
He is the best actor in the world!

1169
01:22:01,869 --> 01:22:03,495
You have to try.

1170
01:22:03,337 --> 01:22:04,933
I am not that good.

1171
01:22:05,127 --> 01:22:08,963
Actually! You are the finest actor I've never met.

1172
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:21,335
Come on Gary! Hurry, you've got to act fast.

1173
01:22:23,493 --> 01:22:27,378
I know you all don't like Team America a whole lot right now but ...

1174
01:22:27,378 --> 01:22:31,214
Kim Jong-Il is a lot worse.

1175
01:22:32,653 --> 01:22:36,009
You can't outact me boy. Don't even try!

1176
01:22:36,010 --> 01:22:38,062
For the truth is that Team America fights...

1177
01:22:38,064 --> 01:22:40,308
for the billion dollar corporations!

1178
01:22:40,576 --> 01:22:46,028
They are just as bad as the enemies they fight.

1179
01:22:48,518 --> 01:22:49,969
No we aren't!

1180
01:22:49,970 --> 01:22:51,949
We are dicks!

1181
01:22:56,117 --> 01:22:59,987
We are reckless arrogent stupid dicks.

1182
01:23:00,947 --> 01:23:04,783
And the Film Actors Guild are pussies.

1183
01:23:06,318 --> 01:23:10,154
And Kim Jong-Il is an asshole.

1184
01:23:11,881 --> 01:23:13,895
Pussies don't like dicks

1185
01:23:13,895 --> 01:23:16,676
because pussies get fucked by dicks.

1186
01:23:16,677 --> 01:23:20,513
But dicks also fuck assholes.

1187
01:23:20,609 --> 01:23:24,157
Assholes who just want to shit on everything.

1188
01:23:24,158 --> 01:23:27,418
Pussies may think they can deal with assholes their way.

1189
01:23:27,419 --> 01:23:29,168
But the only thing that can fuck an asshole...

1190
01:23:29,169 --> 01:23:32,814
is a dick...with some balls.

1191
01:23:35,763 --> 01:23:36,974
The problem with dicks...

1192
01:23:36,975 --> 01:23:39,247
is sometimes they fuck too much!

1193
01:23:39,248 --> 01:23:41,715
Or fuck what isn't appropiate...

1194
01:23:41,717 --> 01:23:44,298
Yes Gary, yes!

1195
01:23:44,299 --> 01:23:47,272
And it takes a pussy to show him that.

1196
01:23:47,272 --> 01:23:49,208
But sometimes pussies get so full of shit...

1197
01:23:49,210 --> 01:23:51,327
that they become assholes themselves!

1198
01:23:52,155 --> 01:23:56,287
Because pussies are only an inch and half away form assholes.

1199
01:23:57,727 --> 01:24:00,423
I don't know much in this crazy crazy world...

1200
01:24:00,424 --> 01:24:02,533
but I do know ...

1201
01:24:02,906 --> 01:24:06,742
that if you don't let us fuck this asshole,

1202
01:24:07,030 --> 01:24:10,866
we are going to have our dicks and pussies all covered in shit.

1203
01:24:29,090 --> 01:24:32,926
Stop what you are doing Kim Jong-Il!

1204
01:24:33,214 --> 01:24:36,283
Do something Alec Baldwin!

1205
01:24:36,283 --> 01:24:40,119
The global warming and corporate America ...

1206
01:24:40,599 --> 01:24:44,435
Fire you! You are worthless Alec Baldwin!

1207
01:24:53,528 --> 01:24:54,595
Don't fucking move!

1208
01:24:54,596 --> 01:24:57,213
You were all going to be treated to a fabulous show!

1209
01:24:57,287 --> 01:25:00,683
- But now party is over for I am the great Kim Jong-Il.
- Lisa!

1210
01:25:01,028 --> 01:25:04,864
And I am the greatest terrorist ever to have lived.

1211
01:25:05,248 --> 01:25:09,084
Terrorize this!

1212
01:25:21,649 --> 01:25:22,608
Lisa, are you ok?

1213
01:25:22,608 --> 01:25:25,581
No Gary. The coundown - you have to stop it.

1214
01:25:25,582 --> 01:25:26,637
What do I do?

1215
01:25:26,637 --> 01:25:30,473
Hit the big cancel button!

1216
01:25:34,885 --> 01:25:36,515
Gary, how did you manage this?

1217
01:25:36,515 --> 01:25:37,378
Spottswoode helped me.

1218
01:25:37,379 --> 01:25:38,242
Spottswoode?

1219
01:25:38,242 --> 01:25:39,392
He is alive?

1220
01:25:39,393 --> 01:25:41,569
Lisa ... I am crazy about you!

1221
01:25:41,570 --> 01:25:43,234
- Will you please forgive me If I can just ...
- Shhh!

1222
01:25:43,416 --> 01:25:46,085
You had me a dicks fuck assholes.

1223
01:25:46,766 --> 01:25:49,510
Attention! Attention Everyone!

1224
01:25:49,511 --> 01:25:52,093
All of you in the audience should go to your homes now.

1225
01:25:52,245 --> 01:25:53,484
Your countries need you!

1226
01:25:53,651 --> 01:25:55,128
But the world will be safe!

1227
01:25:55,378 --> 01:25:56,645
Thanks to a briliant actor...

1228
01:25:56,647 --> 01:26:00,972
named Gary Johnston.

1229
01:26:17,304 --> 01:26:19,912
Let me explain to you the kind of man Gary is.

1230
01:26:20,664 --> 01:26:21,570
He is a man who knows...

1231
01:26:21,571 --> 01:26:23,425
that when you put another man's cock in your mouth...

1232
01:26:23,427 --> 01:26:24,386
you make a pact!

1233
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:26,677
A bond that cannot be broken!

1234
01:26:27,313 --> 01:26:28,604
He is the man so dedicated...

1235
01:26:28,606 --> 01:26:30,058
that he will get down on his knees...

1236
01:26:30,059 --> 01:26:32,091
and put that cock right into his mouth!

1237
01:26:34,352 --> 01:26:35,788
Wait a minute! Look!

1238
01:26:41,236 --> 01:26:44,421
You have not had the last of Kim Jong-Il.

1239
01:26:44,421 --> 01:26:47,586
I will return.

1240
01:26:47,586 --> 01:26:51,422
You shall see, I will be back.

1241
01:26:56,506 --> 01:26:59,636
So long earthlings!

1242
01:27:01,301 --> 01:27:04,274
We'll be here waiting for you, Kim Jong-Il.

1243
01:27:04,274 --> 01:27:06,000
All right you guys. I hate to break up this little party

1244
01:27:06,001 --> 01:27:08,686
but there is still a lot of bad guys out there.

1245
01:27:08,686 --> 01:27:12,522
Well then let's go show the bad guys that the police are back in force.

1246
01:27:12,907 --> 01:27:18,373
Fuck yeah!

1247
