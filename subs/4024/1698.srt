2
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:54,262
Seventh-grader.

3
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,515
Sounds a lot better
than sixth-grader.

4
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,187
This is a Greg thing.
l don't see why l had to come.

5
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:07,066
Because, Rodrick,
this is a family event,

6
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:09,527
and like it or not,
you're part of
the Heffley family.

7
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:12,989
Yeah.
That and we already
paid for your ticket.

8
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:27,587
I'd Iike to
give a warm welcome to
Westmore seventh-graders!

9
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:30,923
A new year
of school starting.

10
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:33,593
Hi!

11
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:35,636
Rowley!
Greg!

12
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:47,732
Alakazam!
Alaka-zoo-wee Mama!

13
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,192
What are you doing?

14
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:50,401
lt's a magic wand.

15
00:01:50,486 --> 00:01:51,569
Do you want
to see a trick?

16
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,529
Only if the trick
is to make
the thing disappear.

17
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,828
Just put it
in your pocket!

18
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:02,997
You don't want to
give away your
best tricks in public.

19
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,249
So, how was your summer?

20
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,182
That sounds
pretty rough.

21
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,226
The only good thing
that happened

22
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,186
was l got rid of
the Cheese Touch.

23
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:26,562
Who'd you give it to?

24
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:27,814
The new kid.
Jeremy Pindle.

25
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,275
Cheese Touch!

26
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,280
Hey, guys!
Anyone for pizza?

27
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,867
Hey! Thanks, Fregley.

28
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:42,411
You know,

29
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:46,415
l can't believe people
leave perfectly good food
just lying around.

30
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:10,648
l'll save that

31
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,359
for later.

32
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:17,864
Let's skate.

33
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:21,117
I'd Iike
to give a shout out
to Taylor Pringle!

34
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,368
Uh-oh, dork alert!

35
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,288
Happy birthday, Taylor!
Five years young.

36
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,832
I hope your
party's a blast.

37
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,376
Rowley,
stop pulling me down!

38
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,838
Ho, ho, ho
It's magic

39
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,424
You know

40
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,010
Who is that?

41
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:43,848
Her name is Holly Hills.
She just moved here.

42
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,725
What grade is she in?
Seventh.

43
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,268
She's an all-star
soccer player,

44
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,811
has done
professional modeling,

45
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,938
and was her sixth grade
class president.

46
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:54,233
She moved here from Oregon
because her father
got a big promotion.

47
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:56,485
They drive a hybrid SUV,

48
00:03:56,653 --> 00:04:00,114
live on the north side of town
in a cul-de-sac near the park.

49
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,867
What? l googled her!

50
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,119
She's a picture
of loveliness,
is she not?

51
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,496
She's almost as
pretty as my mom.

52
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:10,124
She's going to be
very popular.

53
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:17,006
Sit here!
Sit here!

54
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:20,676
Please, everyone,
sit down.
We have our seats.

55
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:30,019
It's magic, you know

56
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:36,609
Never believe it's not so

57
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:37,693
Excuse me.

58
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:40,738
What?

59
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:43,449
l said, excuse me.
You're blocking the exit.

60
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,951
Oh, sorry.

61
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,243
That's okay.

62
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:49,288
l'm Chirag Gupta.
And l'm single.

63
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,667
Wow. My name is. . .

64
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,001
We know exactly
who you are.

65
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:56,128
Holly Hills of
432 Embury Lane.

66
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,172
No,
we don't know
who you are.

67
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,548
We have no idea
who you are.

68
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:07,515
Okay! Well,
l think l'm going
to go skating now.

69
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,019
Please
congratulate your father
on his promotion from me!

70
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:15,982
"We know exactly who you are"?
You trying to scare her?

71
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,233
Does it really matter?

72
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,986
A girl like that is
out of your league
anyway, Gregory.

73
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,072
She's new.
She isn't out of
anyone's league yet.

74
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,741
She doesn't know
the social pecking order.

75
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,452
lf there was ever
a time for me
to make a move,

76
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,912
it's now.

77
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:33,791
Hey, Greg!

78
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,377
Can you break
a leg or something
so we can leave?

79
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:42,008
Oh!

80
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,802
That'll never happen.
Not a chance.

81
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,887
There's no way
that girl will
ever talk to you.

82
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,057
Yeah, well,
l just talked to her

83
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:51,892
and we'll probably
skate later.

84
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,311
Really? Okay.

85
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,731
Well, you see
that clock?

86
00:05:57,107 --> 00:06:00,443
They play a slow song
at the top of every hour
for couples skate.

87
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:04,447
lf you're so confident,
ask her to skate.

88
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,450
Maybe l will.

89
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,118
What you waiting
for, wimp?

90
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,703
You the man!

91
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:17,376
Look, if we can
get out to Holly

92
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,379
and be standing
right next to her
when the clock changes,

93
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:23,632
then l can ask her to skate
and she'll have to say yes.

94
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:26,677
l don't know
about that.

95
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,231
Oh, honey, hi!

96
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,567
Remember when we were
young like this,

97
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,570
and we used to dance
and go to parties,
and things like that?

98
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,654
Whoo!

99
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,625
l'm going in.
Cover me!

100
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:13,891
Girl you are to me
all that a woman should be

101
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,102
And I dedicate my life...

102
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:19,814
All rockers
and hardcore skaters
off the rink,

103
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,274
unless you're
looking for love.

104
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,401
It's time for
couples skate.

105
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,195
l'm making my move.

106
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:36,831
Stop! Enough of
that total lameness!
Who's ready to rock? Yeah!

107
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,712
Come on, let's get
out of here. Come on.

108
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:57,393
What are
we gonna do?
Stay calm.

109
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,895
All we have to do
is just stay here.

110
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,731
Whoa! Whoa!

111
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,317
Rowley! Hang on!

112
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,783
Greg Heffley!

113
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,786
This is your mother.

114
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,081
Everything is
going to be okay.

115
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,835
Stay where you are,
and your father is
going to come rescue you.

116
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,755
I repeat, everything
is going to be okay.

117
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,010
Okay, here he comes.
Here comes Frank.
I see him. He's on his way.

118
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:34,430
Dad!
l know, l know.

119
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:38,225
Okay.
All right, everyone,
go back to skating!

120
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,310
You all right?

121
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,149
Hey, Romeo,
how'd it go
with the new girl?

122
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,320
Whoa!

123
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,077
You ruined
my birthday!

124
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,205
You jerk!

125
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:05,920
Ow! Ow! That hurt!

126
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,020
Rodrick!

127
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,190
Here, catch!

128
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:36,116
Let me start by saying
that having a brother
is really overrated.

129
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,494
Rowley always says
he wishes he had
a brother,

130
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,913
and, boy, do l wish
l could give him
one of mine.

131
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:44,041
l've looked into it
and, unfortunately,
it's not legal,

132
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,252
l mean,
Manny has been
telling on me

133
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,170
ever since he was
able to speak.

134
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,797
Bubby did it.

135
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:55,261
Bubby did it.

136
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:56,345
Greg!

137
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,889
And Rodrick is
the king of laziness.

138
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,475
Except when it comes
to torturing me.

139
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,522
My mom has
started writing

140
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,482
an advice column
for the local paper.

141
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,276
She wrote an article
last week

142
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,028
about how your brothers
will always be there for you.

143
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:16,240
Well, that's exactly
what l'm afraid of.

144
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,537
Hey, Bubby.

145
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,624
Got to go, Mom.
Later, Mom.

146
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,084
Yeah, see you, hon.
Okay, okay, wait.

147
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,669
Hold on.
Wait a second.

148
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,130
l need a moment
for a family meeting.

149
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,800
Now, your father and l
have been talking.

150
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,887
Things between you two
have really gotten
out of hand.

151
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:40,639
Can l just say. . .

152
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:41,724
You may not
realize it now,

153
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:46,228
but having a brother is
one of the most important
relationships of your life.

154
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,731
l mean, one day
you're gonna be
Uncle Greg

155
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,691
and Uncle Rodrick
to each other's kids.

156
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:54,403
That's important.
So you need to get
to know each other.

157
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,487
What?
What?

158
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,990
You need to spend
more time together.
What?

159
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,367
So that's why l've come up
with a new program

160
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:04,371
that's going to reward you
for spending time together.

161
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,459
l'm calling it

162
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,210
"Mom Bucks."

163
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,213
You're paying us
with fake money?
Yeah.

164
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:16,342
Okay, now, for every hour
that you spend together
without fighting,

165
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:19,803
for example, let's say
you give Greg
a drum lesson,

166
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,765
you each earn
a Mom Buck,

167
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:26,185
which you can
then trade in
for one real dollar.

168
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,436
Oh.

169
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,106
So, to start you off,
l'm giving you
each five Mom Bucks.

170
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:35,235
Now, if you're smart,
you'll save up
your Mom Bucks. . .

171
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,112
Can l cash out now?

172
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,366
Well, Rodrick,
if you save. . .

173
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,950
But can l cash out?

174
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,703
Yes, but. . .

175
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:45,913
l want to cash out.

176
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,456
Frank?
l know.

177
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,920
Uh. . . Okay.
Yes, you can.
All right.

178
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,216
Okay. All right, great.
We should get going,

179
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,301
because you don't want
to be late for school.
All right?

180
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,136
Yeah, gotta go.
Let's go.
Okay, all right.

181
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,265
This Mom Bucks thing
is a gold mine, muchacho.

182
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,267
You better not
ruin it for me.

183
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,603
Most kids hate it
when summer ends,

184
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:14,191
but I have to say, right now,
school is starting to look
pretty good.

185
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:31,291
Welcome back.

186
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,210
lt's nice not to be
the new kids this year.

187
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,378
l agree.

188
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,797
l know. Look at all
the tiny sixth-graders.

189
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,174
l'm so glad that's
not me this year.

190
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,843
Just a little higher.
Just a little higher.

191
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:46,890
Whoa! Greg!
Look who's in our class.

192
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:52,146
This was my chance.
If I could sit next to Holly,

193
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,064
I'd have the whole year
to show her how great I am.

194
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,692
No way, Greg Heffley.

195
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,403
This is my seat.

196
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,029
No, it's not.
l was here first.

197
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,783
lt's mine!

198
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:05,951
Let go!

199
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,162
You know
l'm stronger than you,
Greg Heffley.

200
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,956
Don't make me
beat you up again!

201
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,207
Let's get
something straight.

202
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,710
l was sick that day
and l had something
in my eye.

203
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,545
Well!

204
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:20,757
l've never had
students so eager to
start the school year.

205
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:21,967
What's going on?

206
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,427
This is my seat!
This is my seat!

207
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:27,514
Okay,
let's start again.
What are your names?

208
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:32,227
Patty Farrell,
two R's, two L's.

209
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,568
Greg Heffley.

210
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:44,072
Would you be related
to Rodrick Heffley?

211
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,554
l've got my eye
on you, Heffley.

212
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,019
There's no way to escape.

213
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:21,777
lt's unbelievable!
Even at school,
Rodrick is ruining my life.

214
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,070
Shh!

215
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,780
He might hear you.

216
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,824
Nah. Watch.

217
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:31,662
Holy cow!

218
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:33,956
He once slept through
an entire day.

219
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,500
Do you have an amazing talent
that you'd like to share?

220
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,380
Today, Plainview City Council
announced a brand-new
local contest:

221
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,048
Plainview's Most Talented.

222
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,133
Hey! Greg!
Maybe we should. . .

223
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,593
Can it,
Chunky Cheese!

224
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:50,097
Westmore is absolutely
packed to the roof
with talent.

225
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,683
The top prize is $1,000
and, of course,

226
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,726
the admiration
of your friends
and neighbors.

227
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:58,230
This is huge.
l gotta call the band.
We gotta practice.

228
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,565
This is gonna be
our big break!

229
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:00,816
Uh-uh-uh.
Wait a second.

230
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,235
Aren't you forgetting
something?
What?

231
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,070
l showered yesterday.
Smell.

232
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,822
Okay, okay.
Okay. Okay.

233
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,825
We agreed
that you'd give
a drum lesson to Greg.

234
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:11,618
You were serious?

235
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:12,744
Who knows?

236
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,663
Maybe you guys
will really like it

237
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,248
and we can
form a family band.

238
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,378
Hello, world,
here's a song
that we're singing

239
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,797
Come on get happy

240
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:29,636
A whole lotta lovin'
is what we'll be bringing

241
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:31,555
We'll make you happy

242
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,022
Rodrick says
he's a professional musician,

243
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,733
but as far as I know
the only money he's made,

244
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:45,736
is when Dad gave him
five bucks once
to stop playing.

245
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,988
When do we get to
play the real drums?

246
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,032
Like l'd ever
let you touch them!

247
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,076
Watch and learn,
earthworm!

248
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,539
Hey, l was thinking
we should enter
the talent show.

249
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:00,292
l could do my magic act
and you could be
my assistant.

250
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,793
Assistant? No way.

251
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,296
Doing magic tricks
is bad enough.

252
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,590
Assisting the guy
doing the tricks?

253
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:09,176
l'd never make it
to eighth grade.

254
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:22,939
What?

255
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,399
Hey, a cookie.

256
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,109
Manny,
what have you done?

257
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,819
l'm only three.

258
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,072
What's going on?
What did you do to him?

259
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,074
Nothing!
He ruined my video game.

260
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,494
Oh! He didn't do
anything on purpose.
Did you, honey?

261
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:38,705
No, l didn't.
No, he didn't.
He's only three.

262
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,749
l'm only three!

263
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,710
Okay, let's go, sweetie.
You want another cookie?

264
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:45,128
It's so unfair.

265
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:47,381
I have Rodrick
making my life a misery
on one side,

266
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,007
and Manny attacking me
from the other.

267
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:52,803
And I'm the only one
who seems to get
blamed for anything.

268
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,264
I wonder what it'd be like
to have a family
that actually loves me.

269
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:57,599
Little boy!

270
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:01,561
We're a very rich couple
with no children
and so much love to share.

271
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,272
Won't you come be
part of our family?

272
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:08,276
Finally!
Someone l can
leave my billions to.

273
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,240
lndia? Why would
you go there?

274
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:17,494
lndia is fascinating.
lt's the jewel of
Southeast Asia.

275
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,538
My father has business
to take care of,

276
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,498
so he's taking
the whole family.

277
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,166
Can you bring me
back a cobra?

278
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,669
l want to
teach it to dance!

279
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,719
Wake up!
What are you guys
doing over there?

280
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,513
Get the ball!
Get the ball,
kick it!

281
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:39,558
Kick it!

282
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:40,642
Kick it!

283
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,313
Patty Farrell,
you are the man!

284
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:51,778
Nice running, Heffley.
Just have to work
on the direction.

285
00:17:55,658 --> 00:18:00,203
Wow. Holly Hills
is better than Bryce.
And he's an all-star!

286
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:02,080
Well, l'm sure
your soccer skills

287
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:03,999
made a great
impression on her.

288
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,917
Go strike while
the iron is hot.

289
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,043
You'll see.

290
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,962
When you come back
from lndia,

291
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:10,881
she'll be
hanging out with me.

292
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,801
l would love for that
to be true, Gregory.

293
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:17,721
lt would provide hope
for smaller boys
everywhere,

294
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:21,933
but girls like that
just don't hang out
with guys like us.

295
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:30,525
So, listen, you don't
have to worry about being
in my magic show anymore,

296
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:33,737
'cause l got Scotty
from my karate class
to be my assistant.

297
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:36,114
Scotty?
lsn't he like eight?

298
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:38,533
He'll be eight.

299
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,039
Get in.
Why?

300
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,373
What are you
doing here?

301
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,625
Mom said she'll
pay Mom Bucks

302
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:48,251
if l drive you
home from school.

303
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:50,712
We'd rather walk.

304
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,381
Get in! Now!

305
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,302
What happened
to the seats?

306
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,888
l needed the room
for my new equipment.

307
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:03,308
How'd you have
the money for that?

308
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:05,560
You know, Mom Bucks.

309
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:09,731
There's no way.
He only earned
like five.

310
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:18,114
We got to figure out
what song we're playing
at the talent contest.

311
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,491
Easy. Devil's Diper.

312
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:23,203
A ballad? Really, dude?
We got to lift them
out of their seats!

313
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,496
l got it.

314
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,582
Exploded Diper!
Exploded Diper!

315
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:31,044
Slow down, guys!
Slow down!

316
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,380
Whoa!

317
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,523
This Mom Bucks thing
isn't working out.

318
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,860
Now Rodrick can get paid
for beating me up.

319
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:57,237
Oh. . .

320
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,825
Mom, why are you
writing about me again?

321
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:02,909
lt's embarrassing.

322
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:07,080
What?
You know how important
honesty is to me.

323
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,790
And, Rowley, good news.

324
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,750
l called your mom
and she gave
her permission

325
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:13,295
for you to come with us
to Rockin' Rapids
next weekend.

326
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,881
Two days on the biggest
water slides in the world!

327
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:16,923
lt's gonna be great!

328
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,469
Thank you,
Mrs. Heffley,

329
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:25,056
but l think
l'd like to stay home
and practice my magic act.

330
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,314
l just want to
perfect my art.

331
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,693
Come on,
let's go upstairs.

332
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,695
Mom, can l
use your computer
for homework?

333
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,448
For homework, right?

334
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:43,867
Yeah. Definitely.
Homework only.

335
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:46,036
l'm sorry, Bubby.

336
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,039
What's this?

337
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,207
lt's a gift from Manny.

338
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:53,752
He made it for you
because he wanted
to say he was sorry

339
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:57,130
for breaking
your video game.
lsn't that cute?

340
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,883
lt looks dangerous.
What if l sat
on that thing?

341
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,719
Greg!
What are you doing?

342
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,473
Tell Manny
you love his gift.

343
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,522
You're so lucky
you don't have
any brothers.

344
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,775
You're kind of
like my brother.

345
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,526
And shouldn't we
be looking up things

346
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,362
for your
"hundred years ago"
assignment?

347
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:25,200
She looks like
she was born
100 years ago.

348
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,410
Ahhh!

349
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:34,793
Oh, l hope she's okay.
She sounded pretty hurt.

350
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,503
Are you kidding me?
She's famous,

351
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:38,129
and l heard
she's a millionaire.

352
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:41,883
I would love
to be her!

353
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:43,301
You do know
she was faking it?

354
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:44,469
Really?

355
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,720
Of course.

356
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,722
Anyone can be
an lnternet sensation.

357
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:49,808
We could.
l'm listening.

358
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:51,726
You just have to work
with what you got.

359
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:54,312
Wake up in the morning

360
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:55,647
feeling like P. Diddy

361
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:59,651
Grab my glasses on,
I'm out the door
I'm gonna hit this city

362
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:03,738
Before l leave,
brush my teeth
with a bottle of Jack

363
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:07,659
'Cause when
I leave for the night,
I ain't coming back

364
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,495
I'm talking,
playing our favorite CD's

365
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,497
Pulling up to the parties

366
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,917
Trying to get
a little bit tipsy

367
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:18,670
Okay, three,
two, one, fall.

368
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:23,133
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

369
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:27,429
lt looks fake.
lt has to look real.

370
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:30,515
But how do l fake it
if l'm actually
falling backwards?

371
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,892
Maybe you need a gimmick,
so people notice you.

372
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:35,103
Oh.

373
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:37,647
Wear this on your head.

374
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:41,860
Now, do it again.

375
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:44,529
Why can't you be the one
that falls backwards
in the chair?

376
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,949
Because l'm not the one
wearing the underwear
on my head.

377
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:51,703
Tick tock, on the clock
But the party don't stop, no

378
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,538
Remember when
l broke my arm?

379
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,081
That didn't feel
good at. . .

380
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:03,089
l can't believe
you sat on the tinfoil ball!
We're going to be rich!

381
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,382
Okay, Rowley.

382
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:07,052
Hold still. Oy!

383
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:27,238
My computer
was supposed to be
for homework only.

384
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,991
You lied to me.
You know how
l feel about that.

385
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:33,495
Mom, from now on,
l'll be 100% honest.

386
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:35,413
WeII, that Iasted
about a week.

387
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:38,750
Mom somehow didn't
appreciate the completely
honest version of me.

388
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:42,545
Happy birthday,
Grandpa!

389
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:45,423
Next year, l want
a chocolate cake.

390
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:47,884
That is,
if you're alive
next year.

391
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:49,803
Greg!

392
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,012
Honesty, Mom!

393
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:55,100
Mom, it's Mrs. Gillman
from the PTA.

394
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,644
Tell her l'm not here!

395
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:59,521
But that would be lying

396
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,023
and l don't do
that anymore.

397
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:08,029
l'm sorry, Mrs. Gillman,
but my mom isn't in
the house right now.

398
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:16,871
On weekends,
I try to stay as far away
from my brothers as possible.

399
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:20,708
But on Sunday morning,
I have no choice.

400
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,212
Poopy!

401
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,840
Huh?

402
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:29,717
Greg!
lt looks like he has
a candy bar on there.

403
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:31,344
Manny!

404
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,472
Frank,
you're gonna have
to do something.

405
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:35,890
Yeah,
l'll get a rag.

406
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:40,937
Dad, stop it!

407
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,063
Hold still!

408
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,399
All right,
let me see.

409
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,651
You're fine.
Can't even tell.

410
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,494
l'm not going in
with a poop stain
on my pants.

411
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:58,872
Okay, well,
you can't skip church.

412
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:01,207
No, l'm not
going in like this.

413
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,960
Fine.

414
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:08,882
He made them every one

415
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:09,966
Go.

416
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:16,181
All things
bright and beautiful

417
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:21,352
All creatures
great and small

418
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,938
All things
wise and wonderful

419
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,982
What are you doing? Go!

420
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:30,570
The Lord God made them all

421
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:32,780
Please be seated.

422
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:38,161
Let me just say
how gratifying it is

423
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:41,039
to see so many
smiling faces
here today.

424
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,125
Mothers and fathers. . .

425
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:51,633
Okay, we're up.

426
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:53,801
Come on! We're up!

427
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:56,596
But everyone will
see the sweater.

428
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,723
People are looking,
okay?

429
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,350
So come on. Let's go.

430
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:01,809
Come on.

431
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,580
Poop!

432
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,041
He's pooped his pants!

433
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,378
No, it isn't
what it looks like!

434
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:30,463
lt isn't.
lt's chocolate!

435
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:33,132
Chocolate. See?

436
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:56,447
What did l say
about being civil
to one another?

437
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:58,449
That's all
l asked of you!

438
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:00,243
Well, you have
blown it big time!

439
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:02,120
Never been
more embarrassed!

440
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:03,913
Everyone we know
was there!

441
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:07,041
l have no idea
how l'm gonna write
my column this week.

442
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,085
l feel like
a complete fraud!

443
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,170
Well, you brought
this on yourselves.

444
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:13,214
You can kiss
Rockin' Rapids
good-bye!

445
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:16,884
You two will stay here
all weekend and work out
your differences.

446
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,470
And if you don't,
l will.

447
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:22,473
And trust me,
you don't want
any part of that.

448
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:25,059
Do you understand?

449
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:27,478
Yes. Yes.
Yes.

450
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:30,606
All right, let's go.

451
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:41,242
And don't have
anybody over
this weekend.

452
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:43,077
Got it?

453
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,776
Snacks in the bowls,
ice in the freezer,
cups on the table.

454
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,361
Your party
better be good.

455
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:17,904
Our party, little bro.

456
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:22,950
Wait! Whoa, whoa!
We need chairs
from the basement.

457
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:24,702
For what?

458
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,372
ln case we wanna
play musical chairs.

459
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:30,166
l haven't played
musical chairs
since the second grade.

460
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:33,628
Well, it comes back
when you hit high school.

461
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,505
Wait! You get the chairs.

462
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:37,590
l don't want anyone
to be disappointed.
All right?

463
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,092
Okay.
All right.

464
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,621
Rodrick, help!
The door's closed!

465
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,123
Yeah, and it's
staying closed.

466
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:12,083
l don't need
a middle-schooler
ruining my party.

467
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,918
What? l thought
it was our party!

468
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:17,088
lt's my party.
Now keep quiet or l'll
lock you in the dryer!

469
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,589
Rodrick!

470
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:20,758
Greg!

471
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,354
And that's magic!

472
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,444
Jefferson residence.
Rowley speaking.

473
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,613
Rowley, l need
your help! Now!

474
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:30,578
Holy pepperoni!

475
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,084
Get inside.
Open the door
and let me out!

476
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,178
Yes! You did it!

477
00:30:48,222 --> 00:30:50,932
lt's a really
nice try, Greggy.

478
00:30:51,225 --> 00:30:55,436
But whatever you thought,
l already thinked it.

479
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:05,905
When our band is huge,
we'll have parties
every night!

480
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:09,242
But they'll be
backstage parties!

481
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:11,702
Sweet!
We'll get to
go backstage.

482
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:17,875
You, don't touch
that phone!

483
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,253
Music off!
Everybody freeze!

484
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:21,963
Freeze.

485
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:26,884
lf anyone makes a sound,
the party is over

486
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:30,137
and l am a dead man.
So. . . Shh!

487
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:34,308
Quiet, man!

488
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,354
Get back!

489
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:41,732
Shh!

490
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:43,693
Hello?
Rodrick, it's Mom.

491
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:46,612
ls everything okay?
lt took a long time
for you to answer.

492
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:49,615
Yeah, everything's fine.
l was just washing dishes.

493
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:52,743
Okay, honey. Well,
l just wanted to check in
and say l love you,

494
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:54,412
and l'm sorry l was
so harsh earlier.

495
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:55,621
No problem. Bye.

496
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:57,373
Now let me say
good night to Greg.

497
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,416
Greg?

498
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,834
Oh, uh. . .

499
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:02,545
He can't. He's asleep.
l don't want to wake him.

500
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,673
No, l'm not.
l'm right here.
Hi, Mom.

501
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,842
Hey, Rodrick.

502
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,844
Hi, sweetie,
is everything okay?

503
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,637
Why were you
sleeping so early?

504
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:15,975
Well, actually,
l wasn't sleeping.
l'm down in the basement.

505
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:19,270
The basement?
What the heck are
you doing down there?

506
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,314
Wouldn't you
rather be up here
hanging with me?

507
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,401
Yeah, l would, Rodrick.
Why don't you
come down and get me?

508
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:26,611
Now.

509
00:32:26,737 --> 00:32:28,446
l think they're
trying to get along.

510
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,781
Huh? That's good.
Good, honey.

511
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:34,452
Okay.
Everything is cool here,
right, Greg?

512
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:38,331
Yeah, Mom.
And l have your number
if l need you.

513
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:42,293
Okay, sweeties.
Well, we'll see you
tomorrow. Good night.

514
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:47,882
Listen up.

515
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:52,928
lf you do anything
that embarrasses me,
anything at all,

516
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,805
l will. . .

517
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,182
You'll what?

518
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:01,437
Just stay out
of my way,

519
00:33:03,065 --> 00:33:04,065
nerds.

520
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,447
l think we should
go upstairs.

521
00:33:11,782 --> 00:33:13,115
Are you kidding me?

522
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,827
We might not get to go to
another high school party
for five more years.

523
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,329
We have an
opportunity here,

524
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:22,083
to see things
no other kid in our grade
has ever seen before.

525
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:23,584
Like what?

526
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:25,002
Teenage things.

527
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:28,339
Just follow my lead,
and we'll be fine.

528
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:42,019
Hey, watch the elbows,
popcorn dude. Not cool.

529
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,317
That was a close one.

530
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:57,660
l didn't know you
could get up there.

531
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:00,204
You should
hear my band.

532
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,873
We play so loud,
we actually make
people's eardrums bleed.

533
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,542
Ew.
l mean, not really.

534
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:07,795
l think your
brother likes her!

535
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:15,678
l have to go
find my friend.

536
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,930
Yeah, yeah, l know.

537
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:23,769
Reminder!
You can't call
if you're dead.

538
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,031
Dude, this party is dying.
Look, the girls
aren't into it.

539
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:37,825
Look, they want
to dance.

540
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:39,744
You don't
ask them to dance,
they're gonna leave,

541
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,078
then you're just
gonna be that guy

542
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:42,830
who threw the lame
party with no girls.

543
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,498
Go ask the girls
to dance!

544
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,584
You ask them.

545
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,962
No, man.
You go ask
the girls to dance.

546
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,172
You almost did it.

547
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:53,132
l'm not going to do it!
l've seen you dance!

548
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,216
l'm not doing it. . .

549
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:57,344
Did somebody say "dance"?
Break it down!

550
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,180
Rowley, no! Don't!

551
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:02,266
That kid's dead.
No, wait, man.
What are you, new?

552
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,686
You can't mess
with a chubby kid,
the girls'll freak out!

553
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,151
l won't call Mom.
You can kill me.

554
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,653
Conga!

555
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,074
What is he doing?

556
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,994
Who cares?
l'm going to
go squeeze in

557
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,288
next to Rachel Lewis
and Amy Ramirez!

558
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:27,291
Shake, shake, shake, Senora,
Shake your body line

559
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:31,629
Shake, shake, shake, Senora,
Shake it all the time

560
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:33,672
My girl's name is Senora

561
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:35,800
I tell you, friends,
I adore her

562
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:37,802
And when she dances,
oh, brother!

563
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:40,262
She's a hurricane
in all kinds of weather

564
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:42,389
Jump in the line,
Rock your body

565
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:43,974
This is great!

566
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:46,477
l know!
l wish my mom
was here.

567
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:49,313
Your parents are so cool
to let you have this party.

568
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:53,442
Yeah, really cool.
And they can never know.

569
00:35:53,527 --> 00:35:55,402
You can talk
about Cha Cha

570
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,321
Tango, Waltz,
or the Rumba

571
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,448
Senora's dance has no title

572
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:02,076
You jump in the saddle
Hold on to the bridle!

573
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,703
Jump in the line,
Rock your body in time

574
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:06,288
Whoa!

575
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:11,585
Shake, shake, shake, Senora,
Shake it all the time

576
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:37,194
Hi. You've reached
the Heffley residence.
Please leave a message.

577
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:40,865
Hey, guys.
Manny's sick.
We're on our way home.

578
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:42,408
See you in an hour.

579
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,577
Holy. . .
Moly!

580
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,624
You are in
so much trouble.

581
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:55,337
Me? You lied to Mom,
just as much as l did.

582
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:58,424
You know
how she feels about lying!
She's gonna kill both of us!

583
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:06,640
You do the living room,
l'll start the kitchen. Go!

584
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:11,812
Nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah, nah

585
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:14,815
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

586
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:20,446
Nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah, nah

587
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:23,407
I'd rather
you didn't than did

588
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:26,285
I'd rather
you didn't get rid

589
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,996
Of me at that age
Such a young awkward stage

590
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,124
That is not
what you do to a kid

591
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,960
Nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah, nah

592
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:38,088
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

593
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,591
Nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah, nah

594
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,594
Nah, nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah

595
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,430
If this is the case
Let us cut to the chase

596
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:49,475
I'm so sorry
I never let go

597
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:52,436
I went to the doctor
the kind that you talk to

598
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,522
And he said
the process is slow

599
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:00,986
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

600
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:03,280
Nah, nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah

601
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:06,408
Down, down, down!
All right, let's go.

602
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,787
I'd rather
you hadn't than had

603
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:12,581
If you hadn't
I wouldn't be mad

604
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:15,459
At what I'd been handed
Despite it I've landed

605
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,920
On both feet so
don't worry, Dad

606
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,296
lt looks good.

607
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:21,090
Too good.

608
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:24,259
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

609
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:25,386
Let's get the kitchen.

610
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:29,390
Nah, nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah

611
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:35,896
Maybe we can
paint over it.

612
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:37,731
l don't know
how to make paint!

613
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:39,316
l got it!

614
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:41,235
See? lt's a good thing
l locked you down here.

615
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,319
Now let's go!

616
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,281
We're not gonna make it!

617
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:47,408
We're gonna make it.

618
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:51,578
Trash mine
if you'd like to

619
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,038
I'm sure
you'd be psyched to

620
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:55,290
Remember our name
is the same

621
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,334
See? Told you
it would work.

622
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:01,839
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

623
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:07,011
Nah, nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah

624
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:10,097
Rodrick!

625
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:12,850
The bathroom door!
The door doesn't
have a lock on it.

626
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:15,310
The other door
had a lock on it and
this doesn't. We're dead.

627
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:16,353
And if they find out. . .

628
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:22,693
- Greg?
- Hey, guys!

629
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,821
Hi.
Hey, Mom, Dad.

630
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:28,490
Hey, how's Manny?
ls he feeling better?
Poor little guy.

631
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,368
Yeah. He's doing okay.

632
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:33,829
Wow.
The house looks
pretty good.

633
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,914
l was expecting
a real mess.

634
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,499
Oh. . .

635
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:39,084
Who ate pretzels
on the rug?

636
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,379
So. . .

637
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,716
Who came over
this weekend?

638
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,385
What? Nobody.

639
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:51,597
You said nobody, Dad.
No means no, right?

640
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:54,141
Yeah, yeah. Good boy.

641
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:01,857
So,

642
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:06,153
you guys just hung out?

643
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:07,905
Had a good time
together, huh?

644
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:09,740
Yeah, actually.

645
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:11,950
You know,
l never thought
l'd admit this,

646
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:13,994
but we had a pretty
good time together.

647
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:16,371
Really?

648
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:18,665
Yeah. Surprised me, too.

649
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:22,795
So you just
worked it all out
by yourselves?

650
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:26,256
Yeah, l guess. l don't know.
Mom, don't make a big deal
about it.

651
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,633
Please, just. . .
Okay. Okay.

652
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:30,177
But nothing. . .
Nothing makes me happier

653
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,762
than to see you two
being friends.

654
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:32,971
Right, Frank?

655
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:34,181
Hmm? Yeah.

656
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:37,059
Yeah.

657
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:40,854
Okay, let's go upstairs.

658
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,274
Time for a nappy.

659
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:49,196
Hey! What the. . .

660
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,451
You guys got something
you want to tell me?

661
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:56,703
No.

662
00:40:57,372 --> 00:41:02,501
What was General Grant
doing on the thermostat?

663
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,962
l have no idea.

664
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:06,380
No idea.

665
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,382
No idea, huh?

666
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:15,389
Don't. . . These. . .
These are off limits!
No touch!

667
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:19,476
They are not toys.
They're figurines!

668
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:21,812
l can't. . .

669
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:26,024
We have to keep them
away from the bathroom.

670
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:27,568
For the next 10 years?

671
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:29,153
Listen to me.

672
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:33,157
No matter what they ask you,
no matter how hard they push,

673
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:35,200
deny, deny, deny.

674
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:40,080
Even if they figure it out,
never ever admit to anything.

675
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:43,542
Deny, deny, deny.
Got it?

676
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:47,504
Got it.
Deny, deny, deny.

677
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:51,425
lt sounds to me like,
"Lie, lie, lie."

678
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:54,136
l kind of wish
you hadn't told me.

679
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:58,974
Don't you understand?
Rodrick isn't
beating me up anymore.

680
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:02,227
But how are they
not going to notice
that the lock's gone?

681
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,271
Please.
They're like 40.

682
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:06,982
They can barely
remember our names.

683
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:14,781
Hi, Greg!
l've returned from
halfway around the world.

684
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:19,620
And l see that
you're even further than
that from Holly Hills.

685
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:22,915
l guess your
unappealing older brother
was right about you.

686
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:24,541
You have no game.

687
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:26,460
You know what?

688
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:30,088
I liked Chirag
a whole lot better
when he was in India.

689
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:32,382
Man, l sure
do miss Chirag.

690
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:33,759
l wonder when
he's coming back.

691
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,638
lt's almost like l can
feel his presence.

692
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:40,641
What are you
talking about?
Here l am!

693
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:43,644
Did you just
hear something?

694
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:46,021
No. Nothing.

695
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:49,983
Well, better get to class.
Chirag would've
wanted it that way.

696
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,318
Good one, Greg.

697
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:54,529
You may be able
to dominate me physically,
Greg Heffley,

698
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:57,324
but mentally,
l am the more muscular!

699
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:59,910
It is officially on.

700
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:09,795
Hey, Rowley.

701
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,088
Hey.

702
00:43:14,968 --> 00:43:16,426
Does he know
about the D-O-R-E?

703
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:18,512
Huh?

704
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:19,846
The door!

705
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:24,476
Yeah. Don't worry.
l already told him,
deny, deny, deny.

706
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,520
Hi, Rowley!
What's new, huh?

707
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:35,779
Okay.

708
00:43:40,702 --> 00:43:43,745
Hey, wasn't there
a lock on this door?

709
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:48,333
l must be
losing my marbles.

710
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:53,380
Oh. l can't
take this pressure.
l'm leaving.

711
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:55,549
Okay, everybody,
dinnertime!

712
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:58,302
Actually, Mom,
l have to skip dinner.

713
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,137
Why?

714
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:02,472
l've got the most
important meeting
of my life tonight.

715
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,308
Did you say you
have a meeting?
Yeah.

716
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:07,519
Like, for like a job?
Yeah. Kind of.

717
00:44:07,729 --> 00:44:10,230
l'm meeting with
the best guitarist
in Plainview.

718
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,150
Now he's in between bands,
and if l can get him
into Löded Diper,

719
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:15,360
then winning
the talent show
is a lock.

720
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,613
l mean, you'd like him, Dad.
He's a real professional,
like you.

721
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:20,115
Mmm-hmm.
Be supportive.

722
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,327
That's him.
l'll get that!

723
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:27,289
Oh, man,
l barely made it here.

724
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,458
Your address has
so many numbers!

725
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:32,002
All right, Bill,
we should. . .
Whoa!

726
00:44:33,755 --> 00:44:36,048
Do l smell pot roast?

727
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:45,932
Oh! Mmm.

728
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:50,354
BiII got voted
"Most Likely to Be
a Rock Star"

729
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:51,563
when he was
in high school.

730
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,024
You suck!

731
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,277
That hasn't
really worked out.

732
00:44:57,487 --> 00:44:58,612
We should be going. . .

733
00:44:58,696 --> 00:44:59,780
Sit.

734
00:45:02,075 --> 00:45:04,117
So, Bill,

735
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:08,038
Rodrick tells me that you're
a professional musician.

736
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:11,625
So that means
that you earn enough
to make a living?

737
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,960
Oh, yeah! Yeah.

738
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:18,090
Well, enough if you live
in your parents' basement.

739
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:20,717
My parents are
really supportive.

740
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:23,762
Respect your parents,
boys!

741
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:25,555
Hey! That's what
Joshie says!

742
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,765
Shh!

743
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:27,849
So. . .

744
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:31,061
lt doesn't sound
like a cakewalk, right?
No.

745
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,312
Why don't you
tell Rodrick?

746
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:35,399
Give him a picture
of just how challenging
it can really be.

747
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:37,484
No, it's really hard.

748
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,862
First of all,
there's no home-cooked
meals like this.

749
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:43,198
What? Really?

750
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:47,536
Yeah, yeah!
No, on the road,
it's all

751
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:51,456
burgers and fries
and pizza.

752
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:54,668
Then you got to
deal with the fans,
especially the girls.

753
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:59,464
No, it's definitely
not for everyone.

754
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:01,466
But. . .

755
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:08,348
lf you like rocking
deep into the night
and partying hard all day

756
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:11,935
then it might be
the life for you.
lt's definitely for me.

757
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,562
lt does sound fun.

758
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:16,523
But what if
you don't play
a musical instrument?

759
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:19,734
Löded Diper
always needs roadies.

760
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:22,362
So you're
joining the band?

761
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:23,947
Yeah, brother!

762
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,032
l'm in. Let's rock!
Yeah!

763
00:46:37,879 --> 00:46:40,672
l think l might have
brought too much stuff.

764
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:43,341
Let's see
how many views
our video's got.

765
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:45,218
lt's got to be thousands.

766
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:46,845
Maybe millions!

767
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:51,641
Four? We only got
four lousy hits?

768
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:56,229
Greg, l can't lie to
your parents about
the party. l never lie.

769
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:58,148
Joshie says
a lie hurts everyone.

770
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:02,903
Guess who wanted to join
the big boy sleepover!

771
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:04,154
Bubby, Rowley!

772
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:05,363
Mom, no,
he'll ruin it!

773
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:08,074
He just wanted to come in
and say hi to Rowley.
All right?

774
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:11,328
And Rowley's mother
brought over
some healthy snacks

775
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:14,289
and DVDs
that she thought
were appropriate.

776
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:18,418
Enjoy your
granola bars, boys.

777
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:27,010
Andy's Magic Cushion.
Let's start with that.

778
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:32,057
Or should
we watch The Foot?

779
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,979
What if she comes back in
and asks about the party?

780
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:39,731
You need to relax.

781
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:42,609
How about
a healthy snack?

782
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,543
We shouldn't be here.

783
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:02,087
We can't just let ourselves
into a stranger's home.

784
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:05,465
The place is empty.
Nobody's going to mind.

785
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:08,510
Oh.

786
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,845
Look at his face.

787
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,933
What happened
to his foot?

788
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:23,692
It sounded like
someone was hopping.

789
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:25,735
I'm telling you,
it's nothing.

790
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,737
It's just
your imagination.

791
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:32,075
Did you just kick me?

792
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:51,595
You know, you really need
to cut your toenails.

793
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:53,597
What was that?

794
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:05,900
Turn it off!
Turn it off!

795
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:08,028
Okay. Only
'cause you're scared.

796
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:12,699
Let's just go to sleep.

797
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:17,537
l wish we had watched
Andy's Magic Cushion.

798
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:29,841
l love this movie, Frank.
Don't you just
love this movie?

799
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:35,055
He picked the housekeeper
over the supermodel?

800
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:38,058
l know.

801
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,313
lt's got me!
The foot has got me!

802
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:04,959
Greg, is there something
you want to say to
Rowley and his father?

803
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:09,839
l'm sorry for choosing
an inappropriate movie
for the sleepover.

804
00:50:10,883 --> 00:50:13,009
At least nobody
got hurt this time.

805
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:15,845
l'm a little birdy.
l'm a little birdy!

806
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,641
My knee bone.

807
00:50:25,231 --> 00:50:26,523
What?

808
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,616
Mommy, look.

809
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:40,328
Mommy is looking.
Mommy's looked
a thousand times!

810
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:44,290
Mommy just needs
to go to the potty
for one minute, okay?

811
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:47,127
No! No!

812
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,466
What the heck?
Where's the lock?

813
00:50:54,343 --> 00:50:55,468
Wait.

814
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:11,317
Rodrick, could you
come here, please?

815
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:13,945
What happened
to the lock?

816
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:15,905
l don't know what
you're talking about.

817
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,991
There was a lock
on this door.

818
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,951
Um. . .

819
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,661
l don't think so.

820
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:24,330
Rodrick,
l've lived in this house
for 10 years.

821
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:26,249
l've locked that door
10,000 times

822
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:30,128
because sometimes
it's my only moment
of privacy of the day.

823
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:31,254
l know there was
a lock on that door.

824
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:32,422
There wasn't.
Trust me.

825
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:34,674
Greg has walked in
on me a million times.

826
00:51:34,759 --> 00:51:37,177
And if there was a lock,
l would use it.

827
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:40,847
ln fact, maybe
you should put one on.

828
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,600
So that's your story.

829
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:46,811
There was never a lock
and you have no idea
what l'm talking about.

830
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:49,606
Yes.

831
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:54,110
Fine. l'll just
go ask your brother
the same thing.

832
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,498
Greg? Two words.

833
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:11,211
Bathroom door.

834
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:19,552
lt was Rodrick!
He made me!
lt was his idea.

835
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:22,055
He had the party!
Someone wrote on the door,
so we had to change it!

836
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,932
l knew it. l knew it.

837
00:52:24,016 --> 00:52:26,100
No, Mom, wait!
l was exaggerating
a little bit.

838
00:52:26,185 --> 00:52:28,186
lt wasn't a party.
lt was a band rehearsal

839
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,646
for the talent show.
That's all it was.

840
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:32,649
We said nobody
could come over.
He knew the rules.

841
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:34,651
Yeah, but, Mom,
if you punish him,

842
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:36,152
Rodrick's gonna know
l told on him.

843
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:39,823
We really had
a good time this weekend.
But if you do this,

844
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:42,492
Rodrick and l will never,
ever be friends again.

845
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:47,539
The idea that one day
my kids won't get to know
their Uncle Rodrick?

846
00:52:47,623 --> 00:52:49,666
Or have any
family holidays?

847
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:52,919
You two really
have been getting along
better this week, haven't you?

848
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:55,547
Yeah. We really have.

849
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:03,096
Okay, if. . .

850
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:07,100
lf l let this slide,

851
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:12,689
and be our little secret
for the sake of the family,

852
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:14,524
and for your relationship
with your brother,

853
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:18,611
do you swear to be
on your best behavior
and get along?

854
00:53:19,572 --> 00:53:21,364
l swear. l swear.

855
00:53:24,994 --> 00:53:31,165
Okay.

856
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:48,474
You didn't buckle.

857
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:50,977
Deny, deny,
deny, right?

858
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,482
You know. . .

859
00:53:57,985 --> 00:54:02,655
You may not be half as lame
as l thought you were.

860
00:54:06,285 --> 00:54:07,660
I couldn't believe it!

861
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:10,288
Rodrick was actually
trying to be nice to me.

862
00:54:15,544 --> 00:54:19,422
Wow!
You're a Mom Bucks
millionaire!

863
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,424
Where'd you get these?
Thrift shops.

864
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:24,594
There's enough in here
to last me until l'm 30.

865
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:32,560
lt's about time, little bro,
that you learn the secrets
to an easy life.

866
00:54:33,729 --> 00:54:35,146
Rule number one,

867
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,231
don't be good at something
you don't want to do.

868
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:47,116
Guys!
Use clean rags, not. . .

869
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:51,496
Just give me that!
l'll do it myself.

870
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:57,377
Rule number two,
always lower Mom
and Dad's expectations.

871
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,717
Hey, l took
a math test today

872
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:06,469
and l'm pretty sure
l flunked it.

873
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:07,720
Oh, Greg!

874
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:10,974
But l got it back,
and look!

875
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:12,642
l got a C minus.

876
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:16,187
Well, at least
you didn't fail.

877
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:21,067
Rule number three,
never do something

878
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,444
when someone else
can do it for you.

879
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:28,199
"100 Years Ago."
l remember that
assignment.

880
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:30,660
Why write a new one

881
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:32,620
when there's
a perfectly good paper

882
00:55:32,705 --> 00:55:34,914
already written
by your brother?

883
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:38,835
lsn't that cheating?

884
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:40,878
lsn't Mr. Draybick
cheating

885
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:44,674
by handing out
the same assignment
every year?

886
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:50,596
New binder.
Teachers dig binders.

887
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:53,641
The thing was,

888
00:55:53,726 --> 00:55:55,685
Rodrick had managed
to get my dad to do

889
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,979
all his homework
for the past five years.

890
00:55:58,856 --> 00:56:00,690
Which one's
the space bar again?

891
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:03,651
Just let me do it,
okay? Okay.

892
00:56:03,736 --> 00:56:07,071
I would never actually
hand in a paper
Rodrick wrote.

893
00:56:07,156 --> 00:56:09,866
But my dad?
That's a different story.

894
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:12,827
So that's just
three of the things
Rodrick has taught me.

895
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:14,454
He has a lot
of cool tips.

896
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:17,582
l'm not sure Rodrick's tips
are really that cool.

897
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:22,795
Okay, so the
invisible Chirag joke
is still going,

898
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,922
and the whole school
is in on it.

899
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:27,550
But it looks like Chirag's
discovered our weakness.

900
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:29,469
Hello, Greg, Rowley.

901
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:31,804
Still pretending
l'm invisible,
l presume.

902
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:33,431
l don't know
if l can do this.

903
00:56:34,683 --> 00:56:36,726
Stay strong.

904
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,811
What is this?
A corn dog.

905
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:42,106
Rowley's all-time
favorite lunch delicacy.

906
00:56:42,191 --> 00:56:46,402
lf you say you
can see me, Rowley,
it is all yours.

907
00:56:47,488 --> 00:56:51,282
Mmm. Smell that
buttermilk batter.

908
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:52,867
You got him, Chirag.

909
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:53,993
Resist it.

910
00:56:54,078 --> 00:56:55,078
Don't do it, Rowley.

911
00:56:56,205 --> 00:56:58,956
Hey, everyone, look!
There's a floating
corn dog.

912
00:57:07,091 --> 00:57:09,092
I don't want to
get ahead of myself
or anything,

913
00:57:09,176 --> 00:57:12,762
but I think I may have
Class Clown in the bag
for dreaming this one up.

914
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:17,934
ln conclusion,
without last century's
technological advances,

915
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:23,523
there would be no computers,
cell phones,
or modern medical miracles.

916
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:27,652
And so for that,
we salute and thank
our ancestors

917
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:29,195
from 100 years ago.

918
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:39,789
Thank you, Holly.
That was excellent work.

919
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:42,416
l think we have time
for one more.

920
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:46,337
l have to say that
when l read this paper

921
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:48,464
l was a bit surprised
by its content.

922
00:57:48,549 --> 00:57:54,387
But more than any other,
this one deserves
to be read out loud.

923
00:57:56,265 --> 00:57:57,348
Greg?

924
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,352
Yay, Greg!

925
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:15,658
Just read it, Greg.
All of it.

926
00:58:18,579 --> 00:58:19,829
Okay.

927
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:25,334
"Sometimes l sit and wonder
about stuff l do not know

928
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:29,505
"Like what the Earth
was like 100 years ago

929
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:35,094
"Did cavemen
ride on dinosaurs?
Did flowers even grow?

930
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:40,057
"Did spiders rule the Earth?
Were deserts filled with snow?

931
00:58:40,142 --> 00:58:43,811
"There were no
books or humans, so
How were we to know

932
00:58:43,896 --> 00:58:46,939
"What life was
like 100 years ago?"

933
00:58:50,152 --> 00:58:51,277
Loser.

934
00:58:53,614 --> 00:58:58,326
Now, Greg, when we talk
about how important
it is to recycle,

935
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:01,245
we don't mean turning in
your brother's old papers.

936
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:10,046
l thought Dad helped
you with this paper.

937
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:12,048
Well, actually,

938
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:14,634
Dad started
writing my papers
because of that paper.

939
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:16,093
l looked like an idiot!

940
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:19,931
And the girl
from the roller rink?
She laughed at me.

941
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:21,724
Ouch!

942
00:59:21,934 --> 00:59:24,977
Just do something
that changes
her opinion of you.

943
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:27,939
Like, set a firecracker
off in the classroom.
Boom!

944
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:29,398
Chicks dig bad boys.

945
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:33,236
Well, actually
l was thinking about
writing her a note.

946
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,571
You mean like one
with words on it?

947
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:37,198
l've got it
all figured out.

948
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:40,493
I'm gonna pass her a note
with a question on it,
but it'll be anonymous.

949
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,745
She'll be like,
"I have to know
who wrote this."

950
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,497
Then later,
I'll walk up to her

951
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,874
and ask her
the exact same question.

952
00:59:46,959 --> 00:59:48,542
It'll blow her mind.

953
00:59:48,627 --> 00:59:50,253
A note?

954
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:52,088
Do you want me
to spell check it?

955
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:54,006
Just pass it to Holly.

956
00:59:55,217 --> 00:59:56,509
To Holly.

957
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:10,356
Thank you.

958
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:16,112
lt's from Greg.

959
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:27,123
What's going on?

960
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:29,834
Greg Heffley is
passing me notes!

961
01:00:29,918 --> 01:00:31,544
No, l wasn't.

962
01:00:33,505 --> 01:00:36,424
"How do you get your hair
to smell so beautiful?"

963
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,820
Okay.
The note was
a minor setback,

964
01:00:57,904 --> 01:01:00,573
but at least things
are still going well
with Rodrick.

965
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:02,992
It's amazing but
I'm actually enjoying

966
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:05,536
watching Löded Diper rehearse
for the talent show.

967
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:08,039
Bill's taken the band
to a whole new level.

968
01:01:08,123 --> 01:01:09,915
Somebody farted.

969
01:01:13,587 --> 01:01:16,464
l got one. l got one.
l got a good one.
l got a good one.

970
01:01:17,549 --> 01:01:18,883
Somebody farted.

971
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:27,183
My dad should be happy
that I'm hanging out
with Rodrick.

972
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:29,685
But I don't think
he really likes Bill.

973
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:32,855
I think
what he's worried about is
l'll turn out like Rodrick,

974
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:36,859
Manny'll turn out like me,
and, eventually,
we'll all turn out like Bill.

975
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:38,527
Rock and roll!

976
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:40,863
Rock on.
Yeah.

977
01:02:04,513 --> 01:02:07,556
Dear Greg,
meet me in the art room
before lunch.

978
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:10,893
There's something
I want to ask you.
Kiss, kiss. Holly.

979
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:30,079
Hi, Holly!
l was glad to
get your note.

980
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:32,164
l've been wanting
a chance to talk to you.

981
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:37,670
And, hey, you like to paint.
l'm kind of an artist myself.

982
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:41,257
Holly?

983
01:02:45,387 --> 01:02:46,387
Ha!

984
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:48,097
Chirag?

985
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:53,519
You see me now, don't you?
Game, set and match
to Chirag Gupta!

986
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:11,579
Hi, Holly.
Hi, Fregley.

987
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:14,457
She thinks
l'm Fregley?

988
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:15,875
That's got to hurt.

989
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,049
Want to see
my secret freckle?

990
01:03:24,468 --> 01:03:25,676
Ew!

991
01:03:29,598 --> 01:03:32,725
So the note to the girl
didn't work out?

992
01:03:34,895 --> 01:03:39,482
All right. Let's go.
Little bro,
l am taking you out.

993
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:43,360
And here are
my other men.

994
01:03:43,445 --> 01:03:45,488
Greg, Rodrick,
l'd like you to
meet my editors,

995
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:46,989
Mr. Salz and Mrs. Kohan.

996
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:49,492
Hey. Hello.
Nice to meet you.
Hello.

997
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:51,118
Where you boys off to?

998
01:03:51,203 --> 01:03:52,703
Just taking
the little brother out

999
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:54,830
for the evening.
He could use a good time.

1000
01:03:54,915 --> 01:03:57,750
Okay, well, be safe.
And be home by 9:00.

1001
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:01,128
Yeah. See you!

1002
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:04,006
Bye.
Bye. Have fun!

1003
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:05,341
Good night.

1004
01:04:05,425 --> 01:04:08,260
Now that is impressive.

1005
01:04:08,637 --> 01:04:11,597
My older boy
wants nothing to do
with his younger brothers.

1006
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:14,058
You certainly
practice what you preach.

1007
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:16,393
l think every mother in town
should read your column.

1008
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:18,812
Thanks.

1009
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:32,034
Mom would kill us
if she saw us eating this.

1010
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:45,464
Brain freeze!
Brain freeze!

1011
01:04:45,549 --> 01:04:49,385
All l can say is,
get ready to have
your mind blown.

1012
01:04:49,469 --> 01:04:51,929
We are going to
have an epic night.

1013
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:56,934
Are you okay?

1014
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:03,190
Fake vomit.
You can't beat
the classics.

1015
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:04,692
Yeah.

1016
01:05:06,987 --> 01:05:10,155
Here we go.
Here we go.
Here he comes.

1017
01:05:16,204 --> 01:05:20,416
Okay. Very funny!
Very funny.

1018
01:05:23,837 --> 01:05:25,129
This is sweet!

1019
01:05:25,213 --> 01:05:26,505
l told you.

1020
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:47,735
So, you know that girl
who l sent the note to?

1021
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:49,486
Yeah?

1022
01:05:50,030 --> 01:05:52,031
She thinks l'm Fregley.

1023
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:54,366
Oh, man!

1024
01:05:55,285 --> 01:05:58,287
l mean, hey,
don't take it hard.

1025
01:05:58,371 --> 01:06:01,123
Girls act like
they're not into you
when they really are.

1026
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:06,629
l mean, tons of girls
act like they're not
into me, but they are.

1027
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:09,632
l know they are.
l bet she really
likes you.

1028
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:14,053
Check it out.
Check it out.

1029
01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:16,597
Whoa!

1030
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:25,439
Who's out there?

1031
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:27,941
No way.

1032
01:06:28,068 --> 01:06:29,318
Coach Malone?

1033
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:31,820
Real funny, yeah?
Oh, yeah!

1034
01:06:31,905 --> 01:06:35,616
Well, you just messed
with the wrong athlete!

1035
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:36,909
Move. Move!

1036
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:40,371
Show yourself!
Go, go!

1037
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:44,750
You want to take me on? Yeah?
You want to take me on?

1038
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:47,711
You better bring your A game,
'cause l am a competitor!

1039
01:06:47,796 --> 01:06:49,421
Come on!
You will come out!

1040
01:06:49,506 --> 01:06:51,674
You know l'm going
to find you!

1041
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:52,800
Help!

1042
01:06:52,884 --> 01:06:53,926
Come on.

1043
01:06:55,095 --> 01:06:56,762
Something tickles.

1044
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:04,561
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

1045
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:12,444
You can't outrun me!
l'm a superstar!

1046
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:13,862
Go, go, go, go!

1047
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:16,073
Everywhere you go,
it's me!

1048
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:21,328
Stupid carbs!

1049
01:07:22,205 --> 01:07:23,831
There's the mall!
Come on.

1050
01:07:24,207 --> 01:07:25,582
l can't go
much further!

1051
01:07:42,684 --> 01:07:44,059
Got you!

1052
01:07:46,813 --> 01:07:48,355
Coach Malone?

1053
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:05,456
"You can't outrun me!
l'm a superstar!"

1054
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:07,374
"Everywhere you go,
it's me!"

1055
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,667
Come on.

1056
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:15,132
Oh, you boys
are five minutes early.
Did you have a good time?

1057
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:16,467
A great time.

1058
01:08:16,551 --> 01:08:18,260
That is so sweet.

1059
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:20,471
l just can't
get over how well
your boys get along.

1060
01:08:20,555 --> 01:08:23,766
Well, Larry,
we run a pretty tight ship
around here.

1061
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:25,934
lt's all about
boundaries, rules.

1062
01:08:26,019 --> 01:08:29,146
Anyway,
let me show you some of those
Civil War re-enactment photos

1063
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:30,439
l was telling you about.

1064
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:32,107
So, what did
you boys do?

1065
01:08:32,192 --> 01:08:35,652
Just hung out
at the mall.

1066
01:08:35,737 --> 01:08:39,948
And talked about life.
Nothing special.

1067
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:41,033
Oh, my God.

1068
01:08:44,913 --> 01:08:46,330
Rodrick?

1069
01:08:46,414 --> 01:08:48,832
Can you explain
what you're doing
in this photo?

1070
01:08:51,211 --> 01:08:52,252
That's not me.

1071
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:56,215
That's not you?

1072
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:57,382
Nope.

1073
01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:00,344
Okay. How about these?

1074
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:19,321
l can't believe
that you had a party!

1075
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:23,075
Greg, you told me
it was a couple of kids,
a band rehearsal!

1076
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:25,577
Wait, Susan,
you knew about this?

1077
01:09:26,246 --> 01:09:27,287
Yes.

1078
01:09:27,372 --> 01:09:28,497
Yes, l knew.

1079
01:09:28,623 --> 01:09:29,748
You told Mom?

1080
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:31,333
l knew they
had a party!

1081
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:33,335
lt slipped out,
but l took it back!

1082
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:34,962
My instincts told me
you weren't being honest!

1083
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:36,588
l should've
trusted my instincts.
Wait!

1084
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:38,841
You knew about this,
but you didn't
tell me about it?

1085
01:09:38,925 --> 01:09:40,509
l still protected you!

1086
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:41,927
l threw Mom
off your scent!

1087
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:44,096
Great job.
She has no idea!

1088
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:47,349
We are supposed
to be a team
against them!

1089
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:48,851
They were getting
along so well

1090
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:50,352
l let it blind me
to the truth!

1091
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:52,187
Why were you
taking pictures?

1092
01:09:52,272 --> 01:09:55,357
lt was so crazy that morning,
l forgot we took the pictures.

1093
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:59,152
So l let it slide.
And l am so sorry.

1094
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:01,321
Oh, God.
lt feels so good
to get that out.

1095
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:05,367
l haven't been able to look
at that bathroom door
for two weeks!

1096
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:07,619
l knew that door
had a lock on it!

1097
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:11,081
And everybody was
trying to make me feel
like l was losing my mind!

1098
01:10:11,165 --> 01:10:13,250
We're just gonna
let ourselves out.

1099
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:15,460
l wouldn't write
a column about this.

1100
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:22,885
l'm going upstairs!

1101
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:25,178
To a bathroom
that has a lock on it

1102
01:10:25,263 --> 01:10:28,515
and no one can tell me
that it doesn't.

1103
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:33,186
l have to go talk
to your father.

1104
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:37,691
l will deal with
you boys later.

1105
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:43,447
Rodrick, l really
didn't tell her!

1106
01:10:43,531 --> 01:10:47,284
l mean maybe, sort of,
but l made a deal with her,

1107
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:50,495
and we had a really
good time, and. . .

1108
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,497
You're my brother,

1109
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:55,417
but you'll never
be my friend.

1110
01:11:17,357 --> 01:11:19,942
Your father and l have talked
and we've decided
on your punishment.

1111
01:11:20,026 --> 01:11:23,612
Greg, you're grounded
for two weeks.

1112
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:26,740
Also, no video games
for two weeks.

1113
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:31,745
Rodrick, you may only
drive to and from school
for the next month.

1114
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:35,707
As the ringleader,
you are also grounded
for a month.

1115
01:11:36,167 --> 01:11:39,795
Mom, l'm sorry,
and l won't do it again.

1116
01:11:39,879 --> 01:11:41,505
l know you won't.

1117
01:11:43,091 --> 01:11:44,716
And to make sure

1118
01:11:46,052 --> 01:11:48,762
we're also
not allowing you to
perform in the talent show.

1119
01:11:49,973 --> 01:11:54,101
What? No.
You can't do that.

1120
01:11:54,185 --> 01:11:56,311
Ground me for a year,
l don't care,

1121
01:11:56,604 --> 01:11:58,605
but you have to let me
play in that show.

1122
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:00,691
This could be
my big break.
l'm sorry.

1123
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:04,653
Dad? Come on. This isn't fair.
l just got Bill in the band!

1124
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:07,698
Actually, Rodrick,
that doesn't
help your case.

1125
01:12:07,782 --> 01:12:09,116
Bill's kind of a jerk.

1126
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:12,869
Our decision is final.

1127
01:12:20,962 --> 01:12:22,587
You are so dead!

1128
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:29,386
Things have
never been worse.

1129
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:31,013
Our parents are
super mad at us,

1130
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:32,639
so we have to
spend the weekend

1131
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:35,851
at my grandpa's
boring retirement community.

1132
01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:38,270
Holly Hills thinks
I'm Fregley,

1133
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:41,148
and my relationship
with Rodrick
is at an all-time low.

1134
01:12:41,232 --> 01:12:43,942
So he's made it his mission
to ruin my life.

1135
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:46,903
Quit it!

1136
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:50,115
Why don't you tell Mom?
You're good at that.

1137
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:52,200
Grandpa doesn't like TV.

1138
01:12:52,285 --> 01:12:56,038
lnstead,
he prefers to watch the lobby
on the security channel.

1139
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:58,540
l should be
rehearsing right now.

1140
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:03,837
Please, Grandpa.
Please, can we watch
a real TV show now?

1141
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:06,882
TV is just
a bunch of fakers.

1142
01:13:06,966 --> 01:13:09,259
This is real life.

1143
01:13:09,343 --> 01:13:11,386
lt's real life.
You can't beat it.

1144
01:13:15,141 --> 01:13:17,809
How's about we all go down
to the games room?

1145
01:13:17,894 --> 01:13:20,103
You boys like games,
don't you?

1146
01:13:22,148 --> 01:13:23,648
The games room
sounds fun

1147
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:28,403
until you realize that
all the games in there
are from, like, the 1800s.

1148
01:13:28,488 --> 01:13:32,616
My grandpa's favorite
is a really old board game
called Gutbusters.

1149
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:36,661
Now, remember,
the object of the game
is to read the joke card

1150
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:39,831
and all the other players
have to try not to laugh.

1151
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:44,169
Good luck!
There are some real
rib-ticklers in there!

1152
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:46,046
Yeah.

1153
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:47,464
You go first.

1154
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:52,803
"Putting economic policy
before fiscal responsibility

1155
01:13:52,887 --> 01:13:55,847
"is like putting the cart
before the horse."

1156
01:14:02,897 --> 01:14:05,941
That is hilarious, Grandpa!
Read another one, Greg.

1157
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:09,194
l'm going to go
change my shirt.

1158
01:14:15,118 --> 01:14:16,201
Hi!

1159
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:21,957
Oh, hi, Holly.
What are you
doing here?

1160
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:24,501
l'm visiting my grandma.
She just moved here.

1161
01:14:24,585 --> 01:14:27,045
l'm on Grandpa duty.

1162
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:30,882
Listen, Greg,
l'm really sorry for calling
you Fregley the other day.

1163
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:32,217
l don't know
what happened.

1164
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:35,679
l think
it's the Greg and Freg part,
my brain just flipped.

1165
01:14:35,763 --> 01:14:39,975
You called me Fregley?
l had no idea.

1166
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:41,393
Really?

1167
01:14:41,561 --> 01:14:42,853
Not really.

1168
01:14:42,937 --> 01:14:45,772
l heard it.
lt was pretty rough.

1169
01:14:45,857 --> 01:14:48,900
But don't worry,
l have the rest of
middle school to get over it.

1170
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:52,028
What happened
to your shirt?

1171
01:14:52,113 --> 01:14:55,407
Oh, my brother
spit milk on me.

1172
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:58,034
Let me guess,
he was pretending
to laugh

1173
01:14:58,119 --> 01:15:00,162
at something that
wasn't actually funny.

1174
01:15:00,246 --> 01:15:01,621
How did you know?

1175
01:15:01,706 --> 01:15:03,498
lt's in the
Older Sibling
Handbook.

1176
01:15:03,583 --> 01:15:07,085
Last week, my older sister
put hair remover
in my shampoo.

1177
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:09,796
lf l hadn't smelled something,
l'd be completely bald by now!

1178
01:15:09,881 --> 01:15:11,548
Why would she do that?

1179
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:13,675
Duh! 'Cause
she's my sister.

1180
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:17,429
lt's part of the deal.
You fight and then
you get over it.

1181
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:20,473
Not my brother.
He hates me

1182
01:15:20,558 --> 01:15:22,184
and he'll never
get over it.

1183
01:15:22,268 --> 01:15:25,020
Of course he will.
He has to.
He's your brother.

1184
01:15:27,106 --> 01:15:30,192
l also have a little sister
who's spoiled rotten.

1185
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:32,777
Tell me about it!
My little brother
ruins all my stuff,

1186
01:15:32,862 --> 01:15:35,322
and somehow l'm the one
who ends up getting
in trouble for it.

1187
01:15:35,406 --> 01:15:36,990
Doesn't that
drive you nuts?

1188
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:39,242
Holly! Time for dinner!

1189
01:15:39,327 --> 01:15:41,995
l got to go.
lt was cool
hanging out with you.

1190
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:44,873
l'll look for you
tomorrow, Greg.

1191
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:47,542
See you later,
Fregley.

1192
01:15:47,627 --> 01:15:50,170
I thought
being at Grandpa's
was a punishment

1193
01:15:50,254 --> 01:15:54,341
but, really, it was destiny
that Holly was here, too.

1194
01:15:54,425 --> 01:15:56,468
My luck had
finally changed.

1195
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:18,448
"l've never believed
in fate, or destiny,

1196
01:16:18,532 --> 01:16:20,158
"or whatever, until now.

1197
01:16:20,243 --> 01:16:22,744
"Things are finally
starting to go my way!"

1198
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:26,122
Rodrick, be quiet.
Talk on the phone
someplace else.

1199
01:16:26,207 --> 01:16:28,583
"l thought
being at Grandpa's
was a punishment

1200
01:16:28,668 --> 01:16:32,420
"but, really, it was destiny
that Holly was here, too.

1201
01:16:32,505 --> 01:16:35,215
"My luck had
finally changed."

1202
01:16:36,217 --> 01:16:37,842
Aww!

1203
01:16:39,762 --> 01:16:41,096
Give it back,
Rodrick!

1204
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:43,807
This stuff is priceless!
No way.

1205
01:16:43,891 --> 01:16:45,350
Come on.
Give it back!

1206
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:47,269
You know what?
l will give it back.

1207
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:49,854
To Holly!
Wait till she reads
this garbage!

1208
01:16:52,817 --> 01:16:55,026
I don't even want to go

1209
01:16:55,111 --> 01:16:56,653
"l can't believe my luck!

1210
01:16:56,737 --> 01:16:59,030
"l finally got Holly
all to myself

1211
01:16:59,115 --> 01:17:01,324
"without Chirag,
or anyone else!"

1212
01:17:03,286 --> 01:17:04,995
Give it back, Rodrick!
Give it back.

1213
01:17:05,079 --> 01:17:06,788
No way.

1214
01:17:11,544 --> 01:17:13,670
Always stuck
in a daydream

1215
01:17:13,754 --> 01:17:15,839
Can't focus
on the other team

1216
01:17:15,923 --> 01:17:18,174
Hunted you
all day and night

1217
01:17:18,259 --> 01:17:19,801
Now I'm ready
for a fight

1218
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:21,553
This is war

1219
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:24,222
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1220
01:17:24,307 --> 01:17:28,977
This is war

1221
01:17:29,562 --> 01:17:31,313
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1222
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:32,897
This is war

1223
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:38,695
'Cause I got
to knock you out

1224
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:42,198
Whoop!

1225
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:47,996
Oh!

1226
01:17:57,923 --> 01:17:59,758
They say that
you're the best

1227
01:17:59,842 --> 01:18:01,426
You gotta follow
all the rest

1228
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:03,219
This is war

1229
01:18:03,971 --> 01:18:06,056
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1230
01:18:06,432 --> 01:18:08,183
Record, record, record.

1231
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:10,435
This is war

1232
01:18:11,187 --> 01:18:12,854
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1233
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:14,856
This is war

1234
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:17,400
I can't be your friend

1235
01:18:17,485 --> 01:18:19,903
'Cause I gotta
knock you out

1236
01:18:36,003 --> 01:18:37,670
l'm in the ladies'?

1237
01:18:56,816 --> 01:19:00,402
Peeping Tom!
There's a Peeping Tom
in there!

1238
01:19:00,486 --> 01:19:04,280
Peeping Tom!
There's a Peeping Tom
in there!

1239
01:19:04,365 --> 01:19:06,282
Let's get him!

1240
01:19:06,367 --> 01:19:11,746
What do you think
you are doing in there?
We'll come in and get you!

1241
01:19:11,831 --> 01:19:13,373
Take that,
you Peeping Tom!

1242
01:19:13,457 --> 01:19:14,958
Let's get him!

1243
01:19:15,042 --> 01:19:17,168
Get out of here!

1244
01:19:17,294 --> 01:19:19,379
Stop that pervert!

1245
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:22,090
The little whippersnapper!

1246
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:24,968
l've got him!
l've got him!

1247
01:19:25,052 --> 01:19:26,553
Shame on you!

1248
01:19:26,637 --> 01:19:28,680
l've got him
in a headlock!

1249
01:19:30,182 --> 01:19:32,892
l'm not the Peeping Tom!

1250
01:19:32,977 --> 01:19:33,977
Where'd he go?

1251
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:40,650
Did he just come out
of the ladies' room?

1252
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:49,617
Hey, Greg!

1253
01:19:50,661 --> 01:19:52,495
What's new? Huh?

1254
01:19:55,374 --> 01:19:57,667
Well, my life
is officially over.

1255
01:19:57,751 --> 01:19:59,502
Now that Rodrick
has that tape of me

1256
01:19:59,587 --> 01:20:01,463
running around
in my underwear,

1257
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:03,465
he basically owns me.

1258
01:20:05,509 --> 01:20:07,385
The day of
the talent show
came around

1259
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:09,929
and Mom and Dad
made us both go.

1260
01:20:10,014 --> 01:20:13,391
Something about supporting
the community, or whatever.

1261
01:20:13,476 --> 01:20:15,101
Scotty!

1262
01:20:16,228 --> 01:20:17,645
Come on!

1263
01:20:18,606 --> 01:20:20,148
Scotty! Come on!

1264
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:22,442
You don't wanna let
the magic fans down,
do you?

1265
01:20:22,526 --> 01:20:23,651
Go away!

1266
01:20:23,736 --> 01:20:25,445
Rowley, what's wrong?

1267
01:20:25,529 --> 01:20:27,989
My assistant, Scotty,
got stage fright

1268
01:20:28,073 --> 01:20:29,657
and now he doesn't
want to do the show.

1269
01:20:29,742 --> 01:20:33,161
Maybe Greg would help out.
He can be your assistant.

1270
01:20:33,245 --> 01:20:35,872
What? No way!

1271
01:20:35,956 --> 01:20:38,249
What? Rowley is
your best friend.

1272
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:39,918
This is important to him.
You need to do this.

1273
01:20:40,002 --> 01:20:42,086
lt's okay,
Mrs. Heffley.

1274
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:44,881
Greg is just afraid
that Holly Hills
will think less of him.

1275
01:20:44,965 --> 01:20:46,341
Rowley.

1276
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:49,844
Mom, can we
talk in private?
Sure.

1277
01:20:49,929 --> 01:20:51,596
Scotty, please.

1278
01:20:53,724 --> 01:20:55,975
Look. . .
Who's this Holly Hills?

1279
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:57,185
ls she your girlfriend?
No!

1280
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:59,812
She's just some girl
who happens to be a friend

1281
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:01,856
who l don't want
to be humiliated
in front of.

1282
01:21:01,941 --> 01:21:04,067
l see your point.

1283
01:21:04,151 --> 01:21:05,360
So is this Holly
in your class?

1284
01:21:05,444 --> 01:21:06,528
Mom!

1285
01:21:06,612 --> 01:21:07,904
Okay.

1286
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:09,864
Here we go.

1287
01:21:09,949 --> 01:21:12,116
So, are you going
to make me do it?

1288
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:14,744
Please, Scotty.

1289
01:21:14,828 --> 01:21:17,664
No. No, l get it.
l get it.

1290
01:21:19,124 --> 01:21:20,250
Can you at least
point her out to me?

1291
01:21:21,335 --> 01:21:23,378
Okay, okay, l'll stop.

1292
01:21:30,511 --> 01:21:33,638
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

1293
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:37,642
welcome to Plainview's
Most Talented!

1294
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:44,399
And without further ado,
Ms. Patty Farrell!

1295
01:21:55,828 --> 01:22:02,417
Memory
All alone in the moonlight

1296
01:22:02,501 --> 01:22:06,546
I can smile
at the old days

1297
01:22:06,672 --> 01:22:10,550
I was beautiful then

1298
01:22:10,634 --> 01:22:12,093
Wow, she's really good.

1299
01:22:12,177 --> 01:22:15,013
I remember the time

1300
01:22:15,097 --> 01:22:19,767
I knew
what happiness was

1301
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:26,774
Let the memory live again

1302
01:22:27,526 --> 01:22:30,153
Touch me

1303
01:22:30,237 --> 01:22:34,115
It's so easy to leave me

1304
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:38,077
All alone with the memory

1305
01:22:38,162 --> 01:22:41,873
Of my days in the sun

1306
01:22:42,541 --> 01:22:45,877
If you touch me...

1307
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:48,421
Greg, she's cute.

1308
01:22:48,505 --> 01:22:49,797
She's super cute.

1309
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:51,174
Mom!

1310
01:22:51,717 --> 01:22:56,471
Look, a new day

1311
01:22:56,555 --> 01:23:02,268
Has begun

1312
01:23:07,316 --> 01:23:08,733
Oh, thank you!

1313
01:23:15,949 --> 01:23:18,368
Say hello to
the boys and girls,
Freggers.

1314
01:23:18,452 --> 01:23:21,663
Hello, boys and girls!
l love you.

1315
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:25,541
And tonight,
when you are
all fast asleep

1316
01:23:25,626 --> 01:23:31,339
l'm going to crawl
through your window
and give you all a big hug!

1317
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:48,523
Hey, you could
do that. Right?

1318
01:23:48,607 --> 01:23:49,774
Yeah.

1319
01:23:53,404 --> 01:23:57,615
A real live nephew
of my Uncle Sam

1320
01:23:57,700 --> 01:24:01,285
I was born on
the 4th of July

1321
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:05,456
I've got a
Yankee Doodle sweetheart

1322
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:09,335
She's my
Yankee Doodle joy

1323
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:11,504
Yankee doodle came to...

1324
01:24:13,257 --> 01:24:16,718
You can't go on without me.
l started Löded Diper.
l'm the backbone!

1325
01:24:16,802 --> 01:24:20,430
Well, we got a new
backbone now, dude.

1326
01:24:20,514 --> 01:24:22,515
This guy.

1327
01:24:22,599 --> 01:24:25,059
That's rock
and roll, bro.

1328
01:24:27,354 --> 01:24:31,482
Did you guys
see the audience?
Oh, man! lt's huge.

1329
01:24:36,238 --> 01:24:39,157
This roller-skating
kid is really good!

1330
01:24:39,241 --> 01:24:41,743
Don't you think. . .

1331
01:24:47,416 --> 01:24:50,752
Greg! Where have you been?
l've been looking
all over for you.

1332
01:24:50,836 --> 01:24:54,130
Mom, you need to
let Rodrick play in
the talent show tonight.

1333
01:24:54,214 --> 01:24:57,216
Greg, we've been over this.
He needs to learn a lesson.

1334
01:24:57,301 --> 01:24:59,927
His band is
playing without him,
and it's not fair.

1335
01:25:00,012 --> 01:25:01,596
And l'm sure that's
very hard on him,

1336
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:03,681
but l can't go back
on the punishment.

1337
01:25:04,975 --> 01:25:06,559
Mom.
Yes?

1338
01:25:08,854 --> 01:25:12,106
You let Rodrick play
in the talent show,

1339
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:14,400
l'll. . .

1340
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:17,945
. . .do the magic thing
with Rowley.

1341
01:25:19,782 --> 01:25:23,201
Really?
You'd do that?

1342
01:25:25,704 --> 01:25:27,413
You'll be Rowley's partner,
even though you said

1343
01:25:27,498 --> 01:25:30,833
it's totally embarrassing
and humiliating?

1344
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:34,545
You're willing to do that
just so your brother can play?

1345
01:25:37,925 --> 01:25:39,008
Yes.

1346
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:44,263
Come here.

1347
01:25:50,062 --> 01:25:53,064
l mean,
how bad can it be?

1348
01:26:03,826 --> 01:26:05,117
Scotty was right.

1349
01:26:05,202 --> 01:26:06,619
There's a lot of
people out there.

1350
01:26:06,703 --> 01:26:10,665
Just start with
your opening trick,
like you rehearsed at home.

1351
01:26:10,749 --> 01:26:13,918
Forget about
all the people. Go.

1352
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:22,844
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1353
01:26:22,928 --> 01:26:28,474
l am the Remarkable Rowley,
master of illusion.

1354
01:26:29,768 --> 01:26:35,439
And joining me onstage is
my faithful assistant, Scotty.

1355
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:36,983
Greg!

1356
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:39,318
Greg.

1357
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:44,365
Who looks a little cold.
Maybe he needs a scarf.

1358
01:26:54,459 --> 01:26:56,836
Ew! Don't put them on me!
They're still wet!

1359
01:27:01,341 --> 01:27:04,135
Sorry, Greg.
Here's a peace offering.

1360
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:14,437
Fly. Fly away.
Be free, little friend.

1361
01:27:16,148 --> 01:27:17,148
Oh. Oh.

1362
01:27:19,651 --> 01:27:21,235
That thing's dead.

1363
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:23,738
l think l had him
in my pocket too long.

1364
01:27:25,741 --> 01:27:27,742
No hard feelings?

1365
01:27:46,511 --> 01:27:48,512
Keep going.
We're a hit!

1366
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:52,934
And now,
for my grand finale,

1367
01:27:53,018 --> 01:27:56,145
the saw-the-lady-in-half
trick!

1368
01:27:58,649 --> 01:28:00,024
lf you will.

1369
01:28:04,696 --> 01:28:06,530
Push out the feet.
Okay.

1370
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:12,286
No trap doors.
No chance of escape.

1371
01:28:13,622 --> 01:28:17,333
l will now miraculously
saw Greg in half.

1372
01:28:18,335 --> 01:28:20,544
Wait. Forget it!
l want out!

1373
01:28:23,006 --> 01:28:24,131
What are you doing?

1374
01:28:24,216 --> 01:28:25,299
This is the showstopper!

1375
01:28:25,384 --> 01:28:27,218
Good, then stop!

1376
01:28:30,013 --> 01:28:31,681
Ow! Ow! Ow!

1377
01:28:32,891 --> 01:28:36,769
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Remarkable Rowley!

1378
01:28:38,355 --> 01:28:40,898
And Greg the Great!

1379
01:28:43,402 --> 01:28:45,528
That should
have been me!

1380
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:55,830
We killed.
And l didn't
have to die!

1381
01:28:55,914 --> 01:28:58,416
lt was even better
than it was
in the rehearsals.

1382
01:28:58,500 --> 01:28:59,583
Hi.
Can l have
your autograph?

1383
01:28:59,668 --> 01:29:00,710
Sure. Sure.

1384
01:29:00,794 --> 01:29:03,421
Your performance
was pathetic,
Greg Heffley!

1385
01:29:03,505 --> 01:29:06,382
Only a moron
would find humor
in bird poop!

1386
01:29:09,803 --> 01:29:11,220
You stupid bird!

1387
01:29:13,432 --> 01:29:17,226
Oh, my gosh.
You guys did great.
That was really funny.

1388
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:19,186
The unitard or
the performance?

1389
01:29:19,271 --> 01:29:20,479
Both.

1390
01:29:20,564 --> 01:29:22,982
Thank you, thank you!
Thank you.

1391
01:29:23,066 --> 01:29:24,817
Just do your best,
honey.

1392
