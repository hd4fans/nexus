1
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,471
There you are, Tod.

2
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,670
I found one.

3
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,432
No way.

4
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,437
Look at the size of that thing.

5
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,192
Sure is ugly.

6
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,992
It's a monster.

7
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,390
I can smell its evil breath from here.

8
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,596
No, that's me.
I had socks for lunch.

9
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,671
How about you take this one.

10
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,512
Come on. We're a team, right?

11
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,352
Wanna shake on it?

12
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,078
Shake on it.

13
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,110
Ready, set...

14
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,639
- Go.
- Go.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,718
Come on, Copper!

16
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,353
Get him!

17
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,191
Come on, keep up.

18
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,752
Wait for me.

19
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,753
We leap into the river deep

20
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,673
Who can make the biggest splash?

21
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,671
Or the widest grin as we jump on in

22
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,793
Who can let out the loudest laugh?

23
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,271
For I do not care who hears

24
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,432
And I don 't care who sees

25
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,793
Yes I want the world to know

26
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,189
Everything you mean to me

27
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,717
Cross my heart and hope to die

28
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,476
I will never tell a lie

29
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,758
I will not run away

30
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,555
I'll go ahead and say

31
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,791
We 're not just two of a kind

32
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,829
We 're friends for life

33
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,358
Friends for life

34
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,512
W e chasi n' crickets,
or are we just hang i n' out?

35
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,034
I messed up agai n.

36
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,157
I can't do nothin' right.

37
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,117
Hey. Well, that's not true.

38
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,270
You're... You're...

39
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,755
You're housetrained, ain't ya?

40
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,434
Oh, Copper.

41
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,233
Race ya.

42
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,793
Wow, the trucks for the fair.

43
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,031
I've never seen
so much stuff in my life.

44
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,791
Oh, boy. I can't wait.

45
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,714
- You goin'?
- I'm a-goin'.

46
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,792
Chief says you can win a ribbon.

47
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,314
- For what?
- Just for being a good dog.

48
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,551
Whoa. That's a pretty good pumpkin.

49
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,950
That one's even bigger.

50
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,355
And noisier.

51
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,279
Hey, Tod, you hear that?

52
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,788
You OK?

53
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,996
Tripped over my own ears.

54
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,116
See, I told ya.

55
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,710
I'm just a bad dog.

56
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,518
Don't be like that.

57
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,198
Copper.

58
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,350
Time for my huntin' lesson.

59
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,238
Hey, maybe I'll be good at huntin'.

60
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,399
Yeah. I'm gonna be
the huntingest puppy ever.

61
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,238
Now you're talkin'.

62
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,794
Let's see now.

63
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,271
Copper.

64
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,870
Oh, where could that pup
have gotten off to?

65
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,637
Hi, Chief. Ready for my lesson.

66
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,109
Oh, durn my hide.

67
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,990
Playin' nursemaid to a pup when I
should be a-practicin' for the contest.

68
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,116
Oh, you don't need to practice.

69
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,993
You're the best huntin' dog
in the whole county.

70
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,913
Well, I reckon it's true. I mean,

71
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,999
they don't give those
fourth place prizes to just anybody.

72
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,838
There you are, Copper.

73
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,798
We'll make a huntin' dog out of you yet.

74
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,233
Here, snuff this up.

75
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,838
Now, when this rabbit takes off,
you follow his scent.

76
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,036
Then, when you have him,

77
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,352
Iet loose with a big ol' hound dog howl.

78
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,477
I must be goin' deaf. I said howl.

79
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,196
You're gonna lose your head
one of these days, Amos Slade.

80
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,271
It's my head, woman.

81
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,835
Good boy.

82
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,837
OK, Chief.

83
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,036
Get goin'.

84
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,640
What are you waitin' for? Go get him.

85
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,789
Go, Copper.

86
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,869
Attaboy, Copper.

87
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,471
Pup's as useful as a
milk bucket under a bull.

88
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,274
Tod?

89
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,555
Oh, I'm gettin' all turned around.

90
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,710
I don't know what I'm doin'.

91
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,149
It's easy. You just sniff him out.

92
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,230
When you smell him,
lift up your head and howl.

93
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,673
Like this?

94
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,116
No, not me.

95
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,633
Gotta go.

96
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,828
Oh, ding-dang it.

97
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,237
I've got you now.

98
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,954
Come back here, you little varmint.

99
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,837
Excuse me, comin' through.

100
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,677
- My milk.
- Oh, no.

101
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,391
Abigail, wait.

102
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,829
Amos Slade!

103
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,951
Amos Slade, I told you to
keep your beasts away from my Tod.

104
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,868
That mangy hound of yours
just cost me a bucket of milk.

105
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,071
Your fox was after my chickens, Tweed.

106
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,912
What do I care about your milk?

107
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,992
Well, as long as you're wasting my milk,

108
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,072
you may as well have some pie
to go along with it.

109
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,077
What the dickens are you...

110
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,751
Bad dog, Copper.

111
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,589
You are a very bad dog.

112
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,109
Well, you can just forget
about the fair, Copper.

113
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,191
Oh, dagnabit.

114
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:06,876
You couldn't find a rabbit
at a petting zoo on Easter Sunday.

115
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,157
There. That ought to
keep you out of trouble.

116
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,755
Let's go, Chief. Fair's a-waitin'.

117
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,074
You'll get it one day, boy.

118
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,709
You just gotta grow up a little is all.

119
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,353
He got you over a barrel, huh?

120
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,720
Well, say somethin'.

121
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,230
There's nothin' to say.

122
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,670
That's just what I'm good for...
Nothin'.

123
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,116
You're real good
at gettin' into trouble.

124
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,394
'Course you're good
at something, Copper.

125
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,273
We just gotta figure out what.

126
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,794
You know what you need? A little fun.

127
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,236
I wonder if there's
a county fair around here.

128
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,437
Come to think of it, there is!

129
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,950
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm a little tied up right now.

130
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,508
Nothin' a fox can't fix.

131
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,237
- What do you wanna do first?
- Everything.

132
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,914
Mom, fireworks! Fireworks!

133
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,712
Balloons!

134
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,074
Ice cream!

135
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,390
Fireworks.

136
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,193
- Oh, yeah.
- We gotta see 'em.

137
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,952
Smack at sundown.

138
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,593
Shake on it.

139
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,033
There's that sound again.

140
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,432
Sounds pretty good.

141
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,754
Sounds like somebody
got their tail stuck in a door.

142
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:41,713
We're in harmony

143
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,155
Voice like a angel.

144
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,198
- With looks to match.
- Oh, please.

145
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,791
We're in harmo...

146
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,235
Oh, my poor...

147
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,591
Darn this one horse,
two-bit, three-timin' fair.

148
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,319
Dixie, it ain't like
it smacked your singin'.

149
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,317
Can we get back to rehearsin'?

150
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,709
I refuse to work under these conditions.

151
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,119
Here we go.

152
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,714
I'll tell you what, Dixie.
You rehearse,

153
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,554
and afterwards I'll give that piece
of wood a good ol' talkin' to.

154
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,313
- I got two bones on Dixie.
- I'll cover that.

155
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,399
It just so happens I am a professional,
and my standards...

156
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,789
Oh, now, Dixie, darlin',

157
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,235
you put on that
same ol' record every day.

158
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,078
Ain't it about wore out by now?

159
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,196
Some nerve talkin' to me that way.

160
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,471
If your ear were any more tin,
they'd can beans with it.

161
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,028
You listen to me, Miss fancy-tail.

162
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,237
In a couple of days we'll be
in front of that talent scout

163
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,590
from the Grand Ole Opry.

164
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,399
I get possibly maimed for life,

165
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,153
and all you can talk about
is the Grand Ole Opry?

166
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,674
- Oh, now, Dixie...
- I'll be in my trailer.

167
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,069
Darlin', we got a show to do.

168
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,668
You can't just walk...

169
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,352
...away.

170
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,510
Sometimes I dislike that woman.

171
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,513
If they dislike each other any more,
they'd have to get hitched.

172
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,194
Holy Pete, where are...

173
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,792
Sorry, fellas.

174
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,873
Oh, I can tell right now, this is
gonna be the worst show of all time.

175
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,594
It's gonna be the worst.

176
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,633
OK, let's have fun out there.

177
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,670
- Who's gonna sing Dixie's part?
- Just give me a second to...

178
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,116
- I do a good Dixie.
- Waylon, somehow I don't picture...

179
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,159
- D's been lead as long as I remember.
- I been practicin' my falsetto.

180
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,992
Sit!

181
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,395
OK, here's the good news.

182
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,318
Granny Rose,
you are singin' Dixie's part.

183
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,992
Me?!

184
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,310
Oh, she's gonna love this one.

185
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,437
We have a real treat for you now.

186
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:55,071
Lyle Snodgrass and The Singin' Strays.

187
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,274
You can almost swear
them dogs are really singin'.

188
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,639
Like the sun and blue skies

189
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,713
Like summer nights and fireflies

190
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,030
- Like an itch
- And a scratch

191
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,872
We're the perfect match

192
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,555
'Cause we're in harmony

193
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,995
Like a tick and a flea
A bird and a bee

194
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,036
A nose and a tail
A horse and a trail

195
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,951
A pond and a frog
A bump and a log

196
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,477
We 're hand in glove
An example of

197
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,796
Come on, kid. Si ng with us.

198
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,794
Purebred, down-home, true sweet...

199
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,870
Harmony

200
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,513
Any crowd we face

201
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,750
Any squirrel we chase

202
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,159
Any time any place

203
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,196
We 're in harmony

204
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,838
Thick melodies

205
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,989
What?

206
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,672
Sweet honey for me

207
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,028
Listen up you 'll see

208
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,509
We 're in harmony

209
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,830
We were meant to be

210
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,753
Together you and me

211
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,958
We 're in harmony

212
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,509
Y eah.

213
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,194
- Oh, yeah.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

214
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,551
Hot dog, listen to 'em, Cash.
They love that number.

215
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,513
Yeah, and if a cow had wheels,
it'd be a milk truck.

216
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,272
That song is hokey.

217
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,079
They're clappin' for this little puppy.

218
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,350
Well, the kid's cute, all right.

219
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,395
Kid, I'll tell you what. You can sing!

220
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,789
- You got pipes of gold.
- You sure do.

221
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,394
- Hey, kid, what's your name?
- Copper.

222
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,478
Copper, thanks for gettin' us
out of a tight spot.

223
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,549
It was fun.

224
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,636
You got a future in show business.

225
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,234
You come back and see us
in a couple of years.

226
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,151
Yep, in a couple of years.

227
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,391
'Cause bein' in a band takes maturity.

228
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,395
What?

229
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,359
What?

230
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,592
What just happened?

231
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,871
I'll tell you what happened.
You're good at somethin'.

232
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,076
And I mean good.

233
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,759
- What do you think you're doin'?
- Little audience participation.

234
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,034
That kid wowed them.

235
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,749
- Kid? What kid?
- Bye, Mr. Cash.

236
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,350
- That kid.
- Little critter was heaven sent.

237
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,431
That sang my lead?

238
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,829
Oh, no, he didn't just sing it.

239
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,990
He sang it!

240
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,192
You don't mean to tell me
that wet behind the ears puppy

241
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,716
- could ever take my place in the band?
- I didn't say that.

242
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:15,118
Although, he does have that refreshin'
bloom of youth about him.

243
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,273
- Just what exactly are you sayin'?
- What do you think I'm sayin'?

244
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,830
- Better not be sayin' what I think.
- You know what I'm sayin'.

245
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,952
You better know
what you're sayin' isn't what I think.

246
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,952
- Why do you always have to...
- 'Cause you never...

247
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,036
- What if I said...
- I'd say...

248
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,998
You know, this is just like
the time when you j...

249
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,236
You better not bring that up.

250
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,634
Well, I think we've both
been perfectly clear.

251
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,234
Oh, perfectly.

252
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,073
- I quit!
- Huh?

253
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,878
Cash, what are we gonna do?

254
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,275
- Gone with the wind.
- She's gone.

255
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,588
Sit!

256
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,310
I'll take care of this.

257
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,597
I better. That talent scout'll
be here any minute.

258
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,078
Hi there.

259
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,276
Now, who are you?

260
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,273
Olivia Farmer, designated chaperone
to Winchell P. Bickerstaff,

261
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,510
talent scout from the Grand Ole Opry.

262
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,909
- That's you.
- Chaperone, huh?

263
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,077
I'm working to get my
community service merit badge.

264
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,674
Well, that's quite admirable,
little lady.

265
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,394
Then, I'll have more than
Sally Ann Marybob.

266
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,431
Thinks she's so great.

267
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,273
Well, lead on Miss Farmer.

268
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,590
I'm a-lookin' for some talent.

269
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,755
Oh, Dixie, you ain't mad
over a little joshin', are ya?

270
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,589
I was only teasin' ya.
You know how I feel about ya.

271
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,478
Yeah, you have a
lousy way of showin' it.

272
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,710
I am tryin' to kiss and make up here.

273
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,628
Now, won't you please accept my apology?

274
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,234
Blow it out your ear.

275
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,949
All right, you diva dog,
but I'm in charge of this band

276
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,150
and ain't no one's indispensable.

277
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,834
You're in charge?

278
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,309
Which one of us is in the driver's seat?

279
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,072
Now, listen you...

280
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,915
Now, you got me riled.

281
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,077
All right.

282
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:45,915
Yee-haw! Ride 'em cowboy, away.

283
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,512
Yee-haw! All right.

284
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,637
- This is the most fun ever.
- Second most fun ever.

285
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,280
Mr. Cash.

286
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,635
I saw how blissful
you looked singin'.

287
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,029
That had to be
the best time you ever had.

288
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,269
Oh, for sure.

289
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,477
Well, now, we can't let nothin'
get in the way of that.

290
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,032
Like I was sayin',
how'd you like to join the band?

291
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,394
- Really?
- Huh?

292
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,314
Yes sir, a genuine Singin' Stray.
What do you say?

293
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,469
Yeah!

294
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,552
Copper, we were gonna
have some more fun.

295
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,076
Well, Tod can be
in the band too, right?

296
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,754
- Well, uh...
- He's my best friend.

297
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,353
Can you sing, kid?

298
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,516
Course he can sing. Show him, Tod.

299
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,036
We're in har...

300
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,150
Here's the good news.
You're gonna be part of the entourage.

301
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,077
- What's that?
- That's French.

302
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,152
Means you hang out
with our new star. Keep him happy.

303
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,593
He does that already.

304
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,229
And you know, fetch water,
clean dog bowls, fun stuff like that.

305
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,920
- That's fun?
- Does Granny have fleas?

306
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,389
Come on, Tod. It's gonna be great.

307
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,040
Well, OK.

308
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,072
All right, then. Let's get movin'.

309
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,988
Wasn't he amazing,
the way he ate fire, Mr. Bickerstaff?

310
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,351
Maybe you shouldn't have stood so close.

311
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,074
Now you tell me.

312
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,270
- OK.
- Hey, Dixie.

313
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,952
You've come crawlin' back.

314
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,271
Oh, by the way, you can't quit.

315
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,237
You're fired.

316
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,437
What?! You can't fire me.
I already quit.

317
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,357
Cash, you get back...

318
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,872
Now, you've got me riled.

319
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,514
Don't get your collar in a bunch, Dixie.
Pitch a furball.

320
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,876
The nerve of that Cash.
Where does he get off firin' me?

321
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,315
Oh, I thought you quit.

322
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,960
I'm that band's heart and soul.

323
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,156
It's plain as a pig on a sofa.

324
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,673
Bet Cash can talk a dog
off a meat truck.

325
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,916
He talked me into gettin' sweet on him

326
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,788
and now he tosses me away
like yesterday's cornbread.

327
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,753
Honey, I don't blame you
for feeling hurt.

328
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,796
Hurt? What do you mean by that?

329
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,911
You think Cash could hurt me?

330
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,760
Mangy mutt.

331
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,032
Oh, y'all howled
real good today, fellers.

332
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,553
Oh, well.

333
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,279
There's more than one way to skin a cat.

334
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,958
No offence.

335
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,359
Soup's on!

336
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,432
Yeah, that's a good boy, right there.

337
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,109
All right, fellas. All right.
Bon appetit.

338
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:06,111
You know, if I could just play the banjo
better, y'all would be eatin' steaks.

339
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,112
Hey, I guess I'd better go practice.

340
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,835
Welcome to the band, kid.
Let me do some introductions.

341
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,871
That there is Waylon and Floyd.

342
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,028
They're the brains of the outfit.

343
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,311
Why I put up with this low class
crew of mutts is beyond me.

344
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,917
And that delicate flower is Granny Rose.

345
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,673
Textbook version
of growin' old gracefully.

346
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,478
Oh, I got me an itch.

347
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:39,157
Yep, you'll never harmonize with a finer
group of singin' strays than...

348
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,631
You are a stray, right boy?

349
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,239
Course he's a stray.
You don't see a collar on him, do ya?

350
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,191
- True enough.
- I don't see one.

351
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,508
No collar, no home.

352
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,594
Good. Only strays allowed
in this dog's band.

353
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,874
Tod, I'm not a stray.

354
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,315
It'll be our secret.

355
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,029
Chief, just wait till Copper sees this.

356
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,588
Another fourth place ribbon.

357
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,792
Next year, we're goin'
for the three-peat.

358
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,836
- Oh. Oh, my...
- What the...?

359
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,559
- Widow Tweed?
- Huh?

360
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,791
Do you make a career
out of gettin' in my way?

361
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,793
Step aside woman,
I got a prize winner comin' through.

362
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,075
- Well, so do I.
- What?

363
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,755
This here's a huntin' dog.
What could you do with a pie?

364
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,675
Woman's got spunk. I'll give her that.

365
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,468
OK, fellers, ten minutes to curtain.

366
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,636
Let's round 'em up and move 'em out.

367
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,309
- Move 'em round.
- I'm movin'.

368
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,709
- That means you, Copper.
- Huh?

369
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,753
- Good luck, Copper.
- Thanks, entourage.

370
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,714
Say, Tod, while we're on, why don't you
spiff up those bowls a bit?

371
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,556
The bowls?

372
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,834
OK, Cash.

373
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,359
Don't forget. Fireworks,
smack at sundown.

374
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,555
It's a promise.

375
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,749
Little darlin'.

376
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,236
Come on in. Dixie wants to talk to ya.

377
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,315
But, I'm supposed to sing now.

378
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,877
Oh, I know. I just wanna pass along
my secret of success.

379
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,713
Really? Thanks Miss Dixie.

380
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:01,635
Before every show,
take a big ol' helpin' of that.

381
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,198
Peanut butter?

382
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,238
All right.
Let's get to growlin' and howlin'.

383
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,636
Now... Granny Rose,
go fetch Copper, will you?

384
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,315
Hang on. Oh, that's good.

385
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,312
Me, me, me, me, me

386
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,913
Woof, woof, woof, woof

387
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,231
Oh-oh. Bad news in a rhinestone collar.

388
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:28,348
Cash, you look nervous as a long-tailed
cat in a room full of rockin' chairs.

389
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,069
'Cause I'm busy as a farmer
with one hoe and two rattlesnakes.

390
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,038
Oh, yeah? Well I'm as...

391
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,755
- Oh, I got nothin'.
- What is it, Dixie?

392
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,798
I just thought
you could use a lead singer.

393
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,393
Peanut butter?

394
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,159
But Copper, you have to sing.

395
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,831
Hold on, Copper. I'll be right back.

396
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,077
The winner of the milkin' contest is...

397
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,835
...the widow Tweed
and her fine cow, Abigail.

398
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,037
What?

399
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,834
Copper, come on out.

400
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,753
Perfect, just like that.

401
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,673
All right.

402
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:58,238
- You know darn well Copper is our...
- Copper? You mean that little pup?

403
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,669
Why, he ran off
with that fox friend of his

404
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,836
Iike a bank robber on roller skates.

405
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,194
You're kiddin'.

406
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,989
Hey, if I'm lyin',
may my fur lose its natural lustre.

407
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,031
That did it. I can sing.

408
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,192
Great. Now when you get out there,
don't forget to...

409
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,352
OK, see you at the fireworks, right?

410
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,511
Get used to it, entourage.

411
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,038
This is how it's gonna be from now on.

412
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,269
What do you mean?

413
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,399
While he's off havin' fun
and gettin' the glory,

414
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,988
he'll stick you back here
with the chores.

415
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,196
No, Copper isn't like that.

416
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,793
Yeah.

417
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,269
Well, we'll see, won't we?

418
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,711
Here I am.

419
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,593
Ran off, huh?

420
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,153
Sorry, Dix.

421
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,237
Peanut butter? Oh, Dixie.

422
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,072
You are through.

423
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,835
Well, gettin' rid of me
ain't gonna be so easy, Cash.

424
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,593
That looked easy.

425
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,598
Remind me to give
that piece of wood a bonus.

426
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,992
Look, Miss Farmer. This ain't
the kind of talent I'm a-lookin' for.

427
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:20,074
Yeah, you're right. That flea circus
was totally amateur hour.

428
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,278
Waylon, give me a back beat.

429
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,749
We are headed for the big time.

430
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,674
And I got a big time song
to take us there.

431
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,677
Follow my lead, kid.

432
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,716
You were headed for the pound dog

433
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,429
No one wanted you around dog

434
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,114
Now you're gonna be a found dog

435
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,879
You'll be a hound dude

436
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,278
A hound dude

437
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,715
Yeah, watch out

438
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,110
The whole world is gonna know you

439
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,034
They'll be fallin ' at your paws soon

440
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,958
So bark it up all you want to

441
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:08,555
You 'll be a hound dude

442
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,870
We 're all hound dudes

443
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,190
We 're the big dogs now

444
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,431
Once we were lowly pups

445
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:20,678
With nothin ' but our dreams

446
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:24,389
Now we can strut our stuff

447
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,189
While the fans all howl and scream

448
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,350
He's just so darn cute.

449
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,317
Oh, Cash.
I 'm supposed to meet T od soon for the...

450
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,119
Whoa, whoa.
We can't let nobody hold us back.

451
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,310
We're hound dudes, remember?

452
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,393
No more small town dog

453
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,438
Here to make lie down dog

454
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,637
No more bein'just a hound dog

455
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,751
You're a hound dude

456
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,150
Goodbye leash, I'm a hound dude

457
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:05,273
No collar for me
We're all hound dudes

458
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,557
Happy as a flea
We 're all hound dudes

459
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,949
On top of the world can 't you see

460
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,513
Hound dudes

461
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,313
Wow. Awesome.

462
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,080
I 've never been so high up in my life.

463
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,674
I think I was higher than the fireworks.

464
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,189
Yeah, and how about those free hot dogs?

465
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,517
You looked happier than a hog
at Sunday pot luck.

466
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,273
All right. Meet you backstage, kid.

467
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,238
- We got a lot of work to do.
- You got it, Cash.

468
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,429
- Oh, sorry, Tod.
- Hey, Copper.

469
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:57,308
- How was the Ferris wheel?
- The fireworks.

470
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,670
Oh, gosh. I forgot.

471
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,679
Cash and I were busier
than two mice in a cheese shop.

472
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,429
- Too busy for your best friend?
- It's not like that, Tod.

473
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,715
Cash said I had to let everyone see me.

474
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,394
Cash said it's good for the band.
Cash said...

475
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,751
Cash said! Cash said!
Who cares about Cash?

476
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,675
Tod, what's wrong?

477
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,756
Are you jealous?

478
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,116
- Course not, you dumb dog.
- Then what's eatin' you?

479
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,796
I don't know.
It's like you're not around anymore.

480
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,431
Well, I'm around now.
Let's do somethin'.

481
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,869
I mean, if you wanna.

482
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,996
Now?

483
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,752
Shake on it?

484
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,269
- Shake on it.
- Kid, I swear,

485
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,992
you're slow as an iron toad.

486
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,389
Come on.
You're holdin' us up. Let's go.

487
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,233
Waylon, would you get up.
We got more ground...

488
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,392
- Oh, Cash.
- Let's get to work now.

489
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,391
I guess I gotta go.

490
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,233
But... But Copper...

491
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,278
I'll see you later, OK.

492
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:21,599
Yeah? Well maybe you will,
and maybe you won't.

493
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,193
Why eat 'em, Dix?

494
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,953
Might as well just slap 'em
right on your hips.

495
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,112
Come on, Zelda. I need a drink.

496
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,676
Give me one, straight.

497
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,110
Give me that.

498
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,034
Oh, darlin', you look like somethin'
the cat dragged in.

499
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,558
Oh, no offence.

500
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,951
- What do you care?
- Oh, come on, Tod.

501
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,794
We're both in the same
ol' briar patch now.

502
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:29,232
Cast off by the one
we care about the most.

503
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,397
Guess you know how that feels now.

504
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:38,031
- Copper's forgotten all about me.
- Yeah, I heard that.

505
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,390
- Hurts worse than anything.
- Yeah.

506
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,233
I remember this one Tomcat named Leroy.

507
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,390
I'm talkin' to the fox.

508
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,591
You see, Tod, relationships and
show business, they just don't mix.

509
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,353
Oh, it starts out nice and friendly.

510
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:09,434
Then they get that first taste of fame
and it's, "Look out for number one."

511
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,035
First they tell you that
you're gonna be the next big thing

512
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,033
They put roses in your dressin' room
every time you sing

513
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:29,795
Till you ask for a little consideration

514
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,112
Then they call you a diva
Pink slip, termination

515
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,397
They grab the next yapper
Just walkin ' down the street

516
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,832
They got him singin ' your songs
Markin ' your tree

517
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,878
It's lonely at the top

518
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,669
When the lights go down
And the cheerin ' stops

519
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,797
You got no real friends

520
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,476
No place to call home

521
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,996
It's all, good doggie

522
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,355
No bone

523
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,954
Al I rig ht, let's get to crooni n'.

524
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,115
And the next thing you know
He ain 't bringin ' you roses

525
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,840
It's all cold stares, cold shoulders

526
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,353
Cold noses

527
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,035
He doesn 't write, doesn 't call
Doesn 't howl your name

528
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,510
All that he can think about
is fortune and fame

529
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:38,275
There ain 't nothin ' I can do
To turn his head and excite him

530
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,791
Sometimes I swear I just wanna bite him

531
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,350
It's lonely at the top

532
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,115
When the lights go down
and the cheerin ' stops

533
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,714
You got no real friends

534
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,715
No place to call home

535
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,553
It's all, good doggie

536
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,517
Good doggie

537
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,353
It's all, good doggie

538
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,552
No bone

539
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,073
Oh, no, no, no

540
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,718
Good doggie

541
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,791
No bone

542
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:24,393
Good doggie, no bone

543
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,755
Good doggie

544
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,831
No bone

545
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:44,069
Good doggie, no bone

546
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,789
Good doggie, no bone
Not even a little bitty bone

547
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,393
Good doggie

548
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:58,189
No bone

549
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,714
Now that's a good little doggie.

550
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,677
And, you know what?

551
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:08,833
He wouldn't even be in that
dumb ol' band if I hadn't lied for him.

552
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,194
Come again.

553
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,874
I got Cash to think he was a stray.

554
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,790
Copper's no stray.
He lives just down the road a piece.

555
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,872
Little darlin',
all our troubles are over.

556
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,878
How'd you like
to get your best friend back?

557
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,996
But how?

558
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:30,039
Just listen close to ol' Dixie here.

559
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,870
Now we can strut our stuff

560
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,232
While the fans all howl and scream

561
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,469
Whoa, no. That last note
was flatter than a duck's footprint.

562
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,835
Take it from the top, please.

563
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,276
Oh, but Cash,
we've been at it all night.

564
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,392
And we'll be at it all day
if that's what it takes.

565
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,034
This ain't just another show.

566
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:05,079
The scout from the Grand Ole Opry
is gonna be watchin'.

567
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,037
Take it from the top.

568
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,598
- Copper, just what are you doin'?
- Well, it's a cricket.

569
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,637
- Me and Tod used to...
- What is the matter with you, kid?

570
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,837
- Don't you wanna be a star?
- Well, sure.

571
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,475
- Well, then, why don't you act...
- Cash, he's just a pup.

572
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,794
Copper's just havin' a little fun.

573
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,718
You do remember fun, don't you?

574
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,314
OK, all right.

575
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,278
Just take five, everyone.

576
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,878
Sweetie pie, don't take it to heart.

577
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,554
Cash's bark is worse than his bite.

578
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,633
And if he growls at us again,
I'm gonna muzzle him, myself.

579
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,550
Tod?

580
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,193
Tod?

581
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,832
You in there?

582
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,311
Cash, have you seen Tod?

583
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,995
Nope. Dixie ain't around, neither.

584
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,355
You were looking for her?

585
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,910
No.

586
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,199
Well...

587
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,035
I remember when I first met her.

588
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:52,193
I was just a little ol' stray like you,
all paws and ears and...

589
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,316
Felt like a real good-for-nothin'.

590
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,311
- You?
- Yeah.

591
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,358
And then one night,
we went a-howlin' at the moon

592
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,635
and I found out we could sing.

593
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:05,235
And I said, "Dixie,
this is our ticket to success.

594
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,039
We are gonna be stars."

595
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:15,432
I guess I'd be stretchin' if I said
I didn't want her around sometimes.

596
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,358
But we're a couple
of hound dudes now, remember?

597
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,637
We can't let old friends
get in the way of that, right?

598
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,078
I guess not.

599
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,958
Oh, come on.
You're havin' fun, ain't you?

600
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,593
Are you kiddin'?

601
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,950
Well, you just wait till we're on top.

602
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,913
We are so close I can smell it.

603
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,560
The Grand Ole Opry.

604
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,996
All we gotta do is ace that audition.

605
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,640
- Right?
- Right.

606
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:50,472
- Come on, let's go rehearse some more.
- Attaboy.

607
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,390
Copper.

608
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,277
Copper!

609
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:02,512
Oh, where could that pup
have gotten off to?

610
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,716
Copper!

611
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,879
Tod? Oh, Tod?

612
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,599
Widow, what are you doin' up
this time of night?

613
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,149
Oh, I can't find my Tod anywhere.

614
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,152
That pup of yours
probably chased him off.

615
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,277
I wouldn't know. I can't find him.

616
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,758
Well...

617
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,719
If I see a sign of your puppy,
I'll give you a holler.

618
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,791
I'm obliged.

619
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,714
If I see hide or hair
of that fox of yours...

620
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,836
Well...

621
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,951
Thank you, Amos.

622
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,315
Tod.

623
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,439
- Oh, Tod.
- Copper.

624
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,476
Tod.

625
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,398
Oh, my...

626
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,474
Oh, my hair.

627
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,957
Broke a nail.

628
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,512
That's where Copper lives.

629
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,353
Nice spread.
Could use a woman's touch.

630
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,432
You sure this is a good idea?

631
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,511
It's the only way.

632
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,394
When Clem Clodkicker over there
gets to the fair and sees Copper,

633
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,189
he'll bring him home for sure.
You two get to be friends again.

634
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,517
And I'll reclaim my rightful place
in the spotlight.

635
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,828
We just gotta figure out
how to get them to follow us.

636
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,632
That's the easy part.

637
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,438
See, ol' Chief there hates me.

638
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,869
But he couldn't catch a cold in winter.

639
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,958
And wherever Chief goes,
Slade follows.

640
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,395
Let's see your stuff, there, cowboy.

641
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,993
Chief.

642
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,037
Chief.

643
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,789
That tickles.

644
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:42,238
Snuggly-wuggly
little pookie-poo, yeah.

645
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,874
Chief, what the devil is...

646
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,039
Tod.

647
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,510
It's that darn critter of yours.

648
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:10,791
My critter? It's your huntin'...
Oh, my...

649
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,314
Oh, when I get my hands on you.

650
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,190
Hang on, Tod. I'm comin'.

651
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,949
I've got you in my sights.

652
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,720
You can't get away from me.

653
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,554
I'm a fourth place winner
two times over.

654
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,074
Why, you... You come back here.

655
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,628
Oh, Chief, come back.

656
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,549
Testin'. Testin'.

657
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,671
Why, Cash, look at you.

658
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,830
You're nervous as a flea on dip day.

659
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,388
I haven't seen you like this
in a long time.

660
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,988
You ain't never
seen me like this, Granny.

661
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:00,078
I just hope that talent scout
fella's in a good mood.

662
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:05,152
You know, that snake charmer
could use a little more practice.

663
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,998
Don't ya think?

664
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,277
Me, me, me, me

665
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,872
Oh, hey.

666
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:38,280
Get the lead out of them boots,
Mr. Bickerstaff.

667
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,874
The talent show's just about to start.

668
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,954
I know. I'm excited too.

669
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,597
Blueberry.

670
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:41,830
Here we are, Mr. Bickerstaff.
Just in time.

671
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,028
Ladies and gentlemen,
The Singin' Strays.

672
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:53,113
Comin' through.
Excuse me. Pardon me.

673
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:55,835
Tod?

674
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,069
- Copper?
- Chief.

675
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,673
- Tod.
- Copper.

676
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,199
That's my dog.

677
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,952
You ain't a stray?

678
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,591
What in tarnation?

679
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,632
Dixie, what have you done?

680
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,199
Where they goin'?

681
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,880
We can't let them leave.
We got a show to do.

682
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:27,995
Wait.

683
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,675
That's it! I can't take any more.

684
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:42,230
I don't book no circuses!

685
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,193
Why, thank you, little lady.

686
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,990
- You've been so kind.
- Drive careful.

687
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:11,351
Bye, Mr. Bickerstaff.
See you next year.

688
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,590
What are we gonna do now, Cash?

689
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,280
You're gonna go home.

690
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:25,272
- But, the band.
- Don't you get it?

691
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,749
You're fired.

692
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:37,670
You know what? You used to be
a lot more fun to be around.

693
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,593
Oh, now, come on. Where you goin'?

694
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,233
Hey...

695
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,193
Oh, yeah? Fine.

696
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,033
We don't need you, either. Right boys?

697
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,911
Sorry, Cash.

698
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,998
It just ain't no fun anymore.

699
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:59,235
Why does it always rain
when things go wrong?

700
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,749
I don't know, Floyd.

701
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,430
Happy now?

702
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,430
Copper, I'm sorry.

703
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:25,272
- I just wanted to...
- You ruined everything.

704
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,632
Copper.

705
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,390
Attaboy.

706
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,916
Let's get out of here.

707
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:48,519
Oh, Tod. There, there, now.

708
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,031
When we were together

709
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:57,956
I knew that forever I'd always

710
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:03,194
My days follow you

711
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:08,877
Into the blue beyond

712
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:15,318
Never wanna be anywhere I cannot see

713
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:20,872
The love light you shine

714
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:26,916
Only wanna be wherever you are

715
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,276
Runnin '

716
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:35,718
With my friend

717
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:41,797
You never will be lonely

718
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:47,637
You need only look right behind you

719
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:52,953
To find who will follow you

720
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,349
Into

721
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:00,992
I'd follow you into

722
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:04,516
I'd follow you

723
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,918
Into

724
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:14,512
The blue beyond

725
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,150
Copper.

726
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,549
Dixie?

727
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,517
What are you doin' here?

728
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:43,836
I just thought you should know
that blowin' your cover was my idea.

729
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,797
Not Tod's.

730
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:51,311
I guess I just lost sight
of what's really important.

731
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:54,836
And darlin', I'm awful sorry.

732
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,593
He never wanted to hurt you.

733
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,318
He just wanted you
to be his friend again.

734
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,078
Well...

735
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,668
That's what I came to say.

736
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,352
Copper?

737
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:41,154
- Hi.
- Hi.

738
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,549
We still friends?

739
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,319
I don't know. Aren't you all mad?

740
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,557
Well, I've been thinkin'.

741
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,790
I've been kind of a cabbage head.

742
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:55,475
If that ain't right,
then grits ain't groceries.

743
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,470
Well, anyway.

744
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,909
I sure am sorry.

745
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,356
Yeah, I'm sorry too.

746
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,234
Hey, I just got a great idea. Hang on.

747
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:14,077
- I got somethin' for ya.
- Thanks, but I didn't get you anything.

748
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,515
No, it belongs to the talent scout.

749
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,433
I figured you can use it to find him.

750
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,836
You know,
if you still want that audition.

751
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,035
How?

752
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,549
You're a real huntin' dog, aren't ya?

753
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,313
And this here hat is his address.

754
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,477
Yeah, that's it. Get a good whiff.

755
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,872
OK, you get the scout
and I'll go get the band.

756
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:47,270
Lyle, you fool. There's your problem.

757
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:50,193
The do-hickey is comin'
out of the watchamacallit

758
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,475
and leakin' all over the hoozanozzle.

759
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,033
Cash. Cash.

760
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,715
- Dixie's in trouble.
- What's happened?

761
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,279
- Trouble?
- What's wrong?

762
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,759
- We gotta go.
- Where?

763
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,996
Sit!

764
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,594
- Where is she?
- Follow me.

765
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,752
All right. That'll do her.

766
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,269
All right, fellers. We are off to...

767
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,553
Fellers?

768
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,514
Waylon?

769
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,636
Cash?

770
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,119
Anybody?

771
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:51,318
Well, where is she?

772
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,073
That a way.

773
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:02,277
- Come on, everyone. Follow me.
- This better be her.

774
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,879
I mean it.

775
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,030
Copper, where's Dixie?

776
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,997
She'll be along.

777
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,469
Cash.

778
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,391
Way to go, Copper.

779
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,152
Cash, are you all right?

780
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,548
No, are you all right?

781
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,312
- I'm fine.
- I'm fine.

782
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,992
What in tarnation?

783
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,793
I thought you were in trouble.

784
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:42,314
Just exactly why
did you get us all together?

785
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:45,993
'Cause...

786
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,588
'Cause that's how it ought to be.

787
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:50,910
Like the words in the song.

788
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:55,477
Like the sun and blue skies.

789
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:00,554
Like summer nights and fireflies.

790
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:04,235
- Like an itch.
- And a scratch.

791
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:10,509
Well, ain't somebody gonna sing?

792
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:17,556
We're the perfect match

793
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:24,436
'Cause we're in harmony

794
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,397
Like a rhyme and a song we all belong

795
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,072
Like a bird in a tree
We were meant to be

796
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,832
Like a nose and a tail
And a horse and a trail

797
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,592
Like a bass and a fiddle
Like a laugh and a riddle

798
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:00,029
Like a pond and a frog
Like a bump and a log

799
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:07,516
We 're a hand and a glove
An example of

800
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,470
Gosh, I missed you.

801
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:23,350
Purebred, down-home
Good sweet harmony

802
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,158
Any crowd we face

803
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,071
Every squirrel we chase

804
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,559
Any time any place

805
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,200
We 're in harmony

806
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,396
Every time we howl

807
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,550
Every line we growl

808
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:36,629
- Every note
- Every vowel

809
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:44,599
We 're in harmony

810
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:50,312
'Cause we 're in harmony

811
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:02,798

We've got to talk.

818
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,916
Well, there you go, Cash.

00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,156
You just got what you always wanted.

820
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:32,630
Well, maybe I had it all along.

821
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,837
- What are you sayin'?
- What do you think I'm sayin'?

822
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,230
You better be sayin'
what I think you're sayin'.

823
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:42,995
I think you know what I'm sayin'
is what you think I'm sayin'.

824
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,116
Well...

825
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,668
I thought you'd never ask.

826
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:51,672
Now, there's the good news.

827
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,640
Somebody smack me,
I must be dreamin'!

828
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:58,633
We got a little ol' barn called,
The Grand Ole Opry I'd like to show ya.

829
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:02,872
Yes, sir. That sounds great.
That would be fantastic.

830
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,316
Tod!

831
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:16,468
Tod!

832
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,028
Copper?

833
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,519
But, the band.

834
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:23,352
Aren't you goin' with them?

835
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:27,319
Can't. You and me,
we got crickets to chase.

836
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:34,838
And if I ever forget that again,
you just kick me in my walkin' away end.

837
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:38,071
- Shake on it?
- Shake on it.

838
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:48,396
We go together
like beggin' and suppertime

839
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,830
Drivin' down the county line
Ears flappin' overtime

840
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,992
We go together like a fiddle and a bow

841
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:58,675
Diggin ' and a hole
A biscuit and a bone

842
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:02,554
I don 't care if the cold wind blows

843
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,995
I don 't care if the stars don 't show

844
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:08,832
You can say it now
You can say it never

845
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:11,992
But as long as we 're goin ' somewhere

846
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:14,594
We go together together

847
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,070
Together together

848
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,872
Hey.

849
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:23,077
We go together like wet dog and smelly

850
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:25,037
Peanut butter, jelly

851
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:26,519
Fleas on my belly

852
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,831
We go together like fireflies and jars

853
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:33,071
Chasin ' after cars
Barkin ' at a shootin ' star

854
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:36,948
I don 't care if the cold wind blows

855
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:40,430
I don 't care if the stars don 't show

856
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:43,518
You can say it now
And you can say it never

857
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:46,831
But as long as we 're goin ' somewhere

858
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,639
We go together together

859
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,949
Together together

860
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,552
Come on!

861
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:04,959
W ait for me!

862
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:11,430
We go together like a song in the air

863
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:14,796
Like a once in a lifetime
Memory you share

864
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:17,957
We go together like dreams and prayers

865
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:21,510
Like a little bit of heaven
And we 're already there

866
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:27,311
You can say it now
Or say it forever

867
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:30,910
But as long as we 're goin ' somewhere

868
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,309
We go together together

869
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:36,676
Together together

870
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,956
Together together

871
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,396
Together together

872
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,278
Come on!

873
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,197
Come on!
