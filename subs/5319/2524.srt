1
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,676
You poor little fella.

2
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,869
It's all right.

3
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,916
Big Mama's here.

4
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,555
You know, you're gonna
need some caring for.

5
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,632
Now... Now, let's see, darlin'.

6
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,556
You need...

7
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,435
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

8
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,432
Not me. Not Big Mama, now.

9
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,150
Now I'm thinkin', though.

10
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,877
Now... Now don't...
Don't you move, honey.

11
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,155
Big Mama's gonna be right back.

12
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,950
Good work, Boomer.
We'll get him this time.

13
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,310
I think he's in there.

14
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,713
Am I glad I found you boys.

15
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,792
There's no time to lose.
I need your help. Now come on.

16
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,189
- Come on.
- Let's go, Boomer. Come on.

17
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,357
Yeah, but... Oh, shucks.

18
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,672
Oh, poor little guy.

19
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,029
Don't you worry now. We're going
to find someone to look after you.

20
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,754
Hey, I think I got an idea.

21
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,630
OK, Boomer,
now you know what to do.

22
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,233
Yeah, leave it to me.
Leave it to me.

23
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,518
Who is it?

24
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,238
Well, I was sure
I heard someone knocking.

25
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,710
Oh, dear! My laundry!

26
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,759
Oh, here! Stop it!

27
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,593
Oh, you pesky birds!
Will you come back here?

28
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,591
Oh, stop!

29
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,149
Well, I wonder what
got into those birds.

30
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,071
Well, bless my soul!

31
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,556
Why, it's...

32
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,029
It's a baby fox.

33
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,512
Hello, little fella.

34
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,068
I wonder where its mother is.

35
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,031
Come on, now.
I'm not going to harm you.

36
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,192
Now, now. Oh, isn't that...?

37
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,558
Oh, my, my. You're a feisty
little rascal, aren't you?

38
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,679
There, there, now. Calm down.

39
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,548
No, I just can't leave you
out here all alone.

40
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,949
Oh, isn't he darling?

41
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,951
Now, not so fast.

42
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,396
Now, now, not so fast.

43
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,638
Oh, my. You're such a little toddler.

44
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,559
Say, that's what
I'm going to call you.

45
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,951
Tod.

46
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,190
You know, Tod,

47
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,590
I'm not going to be
so lonesome anymore.

48
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,952
I got a surprise for you,
Chief, old boy.

49
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,508
Now, now, now, take it easy.

50
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,549
Well, how's this for a huntin' dog?

51
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,558
He's just a little runt now,
but he'll grow.

52
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,599
You may as well
get used to him, Chief.

53
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,152
He's for you
to look after from now on.

54
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,637
Tod, stop pestering Abigail.

55
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,033
Abigail, you're going
to have to be patient with Tod.

56
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,435
He's one of the family now.

57
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,076
Oh, of course. Now I know.

58
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,470
I declare,
I never will get my chores done.

59
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,154
Oh, mercy!

60
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,794
Tod! Tod, stop it!

61
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,916
Abigail! Abigail!

62
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,629
Oh, no! There goes my milk! Oh, no!

63
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,195
Easy, easy, Abigail.

64
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,431
Steady, old girl. Steady.

65
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,351
There, there.

66
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,036
Tod, you come here.

67
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,918
I said come here!

68
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,555
Just look what you've done.

69
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,188
Now, don't try to butter me up.

70
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,472
Oh, Tod, I just can't
stay angry with you.

71
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,155
You little imp.
Now run along and play.

72
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,798
Go on.

73
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,354
And try to stay out of mischief.

74
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,038
Hey, it's Dinky and Boomer.
Maybe they wanna play.

75
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,957
Is this it, Boomer?

76
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,758
Sure, Dinky. This is the place.

77
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,274
I never forget a tree.
I never forget a tree.

78
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,511
He won't get away this time.

79
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,752
Hold it, Boomer.
I think I hear somethin'.

80
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,718
That's him, all right, Dinky.
That's him, all right.

81
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,311
Get ready, Boomer.

82
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,359
Hey, I can hear him movin'. Listen.

83
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,396
That's funny. I don't hear nothin'.

84
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,793
Quiet.

85
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,789
That's him, Dinky.
That's him, all right.

86
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,269
Button your beak, will ya?

87
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,197
I'll check it out.

88
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,196
Would you look at that?

89
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,872
OK, Boomer, he's right... there.

90
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,916
Yikes! Watch it!

91
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,638
Why, you...

92
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,312
Nail him, Boomer! Sock it to him!

93
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,913
Hiya, fellas.

94
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,992
What ya doin'? Wanna play?

95
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,311
Stay outta this, kid.
This don't concern you.

96
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,513
Let him have it!

97
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,990
Don't let the creep get away!
You can take him, Boomer!

98
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,753
Give him a left! A right!
Let him have it!

99
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,036
- Which way did he go?
- This way.

100
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,359
There he is!

101
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,678
What happened to ya? Golly!

102
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,355
Oh, shucks!
I think I bent my beak.

103
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,352
Now see what you done?
You cost us our breakfast.

104
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,670
I cost us our breakfast?
It was your fault.

105
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,355
- What are you talkin', my fault?
- Yeah, yeah.

106
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,193
A worm? For breakfast?

107
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,593
Hey, there, Copper,
what ya sniffin' at?

108
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,229
Somethin'... I never smelled...

109
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,754
...before, Chief.

110
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,432
Let me see.

111
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,351
Shucks, that's easy.

112
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,353
The master's just cookin' grits
and fatback. You oughta know that.

113
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,512
That's not what I smell.

114
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,160
I don't know, Chief.

115
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,515
It's something else.

116
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,031
Sonny, you got a lot of learnin' to do
about a-sniffin' and a-smellin'.

117
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,553
Hey, where you goin'?

118
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,871
I want to find out
what that smell is.

119
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,033
OK, Copper, but the master
ain't gonna like you wanderin' off.

120
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,033
I won't get lost, Chief.
I can smell my way back.

121
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,671
Can't tell these young
whippersnappers anything.

122
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,519
What ya smellin'?

123
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,670
I'm on the trail of somethin'.

124
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,833
Trail of what?

125
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,432
I don't know yet.

126
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,516
Why, it's... it's you!

127
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,639
What do you do that for?

128
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,998
We're supposed to do that
when we find what we've been trackin'.

129
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,877
I'm a fox.

130
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,235
My name's Tod.
What's your name, kid?

131
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,233
Mine's Copper. I'm a hound dog.

132
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,153
Gee, I bet you'd be good
playin' hide-and-seek.

133
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,151
Wanna try it, Copper?

134
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,276
Can I use my nose?

135
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,518
Sure. OK.

136
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,955
Now go ahead
and close your eyes and count.

137
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,830
One, two, three...

138
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,557
No, Copper! You can't peek!

139
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,832
Now start again.

140
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:11,198
One, two, three, four,

141
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,874
five, six, seven...

142
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,475
My, my. Look at that.

143
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:21,314
A fox and a hound, playin' together.

144
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,880
When you're the best of friends

145
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,434
Having so much fun together

146
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,832
You're not even aware
you're such a funny pair

147
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,356
You're the best of friends

148
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,954
Life 's a happy game

149
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,353
You could clown around forever

150
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,877
Neither one of you sees
your natural boundaries

151
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,793
Life 's one happy game

152
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,394
Copper!

153
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,436
Gee, I 've gotta go.

154
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,272
If only the world
wouldn 't get in the way

155
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,909
If only people
would just let you play

156
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,629
They say you 're both being fools

157
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,269
You 're breaking all the rules

158
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,319
They can 't understand

159
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,196
The magic of your wonderland

160
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,914
When you 're the best of friends

161
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,549
Copper!

162
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,593
Sharing all that you discover

163
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:53,470
When these moments have passed
Will that friendship last?

164
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,551
Who can say?

165
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,596
There 's a way

166
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,910
Oh, I hope

167
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,594
I hope it never ends

168
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,591
Come on, Copper!

169
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:10,596
'Cause you 're the best of friends

170
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,437
Copper, you're my very best friend.

171
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,636
And you're mine too, T od.

172
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,918
And we'll always
be friends forever, won't we?

173
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,797
Yeah, forever.

174
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,031
Hey, let's go swimmin'!

175
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,554
Give me a head start
and I can beat ya!

176
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,990
Dagnabit! That Copper pup's gone
and strayed off again.

177
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,672
Come on, Chief.

178
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,991
If that little rascal's
gonna make me a good huntin' dog,

179
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,832
he's gotta learn to mind.

180
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,079
Copper! Get over here!

181
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,632
Copper!

182
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,912
I gotta go home.

183
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,753
Do ya have to?
We're havin' too much fun.

184
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,869
I gotta. He sounds awful mad.

185
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,871
I'll see ya tomorrow!

186
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,269
- And don't forget!
- I won't!

187
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,560
Hey, Copper, what happened to ya?

188
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,511
Why didn't you...?

189
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,234
Golly! You're all tied up.

190
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,550
Yeah, and it's no fun either.

191
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,915
The master says I gotta stay home.

192
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,958
Well, we can play around here then.

193
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,872
Oh, no.
Not with old Chief over there.

194
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,551
Is that him making that awful noise?

195
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,835
He keeps me awake at night.

196
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,708
Oh, don't go in there!
He can get awful mean!

197
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,233
He's cranky.

198
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,910
Gee-whillikers, is he ever big.

199
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,878
His ears isn't as big as yours, Copper.

200
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,918
That's not the part
you gotta worry about.

201
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,550
Wow! Look at those teeth.

202
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,234
That's the part
you gotta worry about!

203
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,594
I'm gainin' on him.

204
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,910
- He won't get away now.
- He's wakin' up!

205
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,273
Get out, Tod!

206
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,751
No. He's havin' a dream.
He's chasin' somethin'.

207
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,751
When I get him cornered...

208
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,118
It's... It's... It's a big old badger.

209
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,749
Copper, he's chasin' a badger.

210
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,440
No, no, it ain't a badger.

211
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,712
It's a... It's a f...

212
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,030
It's a fox. A fox?

213
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,711
Run, Tod! Run!

214
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,796
Tod!

215
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,438
Amos Slade,
you trigger-happy lunatic!

216
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,351
Give me that gun!

217
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,270
My radiator!

218
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,635
Why, you blasted female.

219
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,429
- I'll... I'll...
- Hold it right there!

220
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,954
Watch it! That thing's loaded!

221
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,036
Now it ain't loaded!

222
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:25,116
Dagnabit, woman! Your thievin' fox
was after my chickens!

223
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,475
Rubbish and poppycock!

224
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,472
I don't believe it.
He wouldn't hurt a thing.

225
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,155
You callin' me a liar,
you muddleheaded female?

226
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,152
- I saw it happen!
- Amos Slade, that temper of yours

227
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,470
is going to get you
into a lot of trouble.

228
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,834
Temper?

229
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,037
Temper, woman?
You ain't seen my temper!

230
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:49,836
If I ever catch that fox
on my property again, I'll blast him!

231
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,957
And next time, I won't miss!

232
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,911
Poor little tyke.

233
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,117
It's a shame I have
to keep him cooped up.

234
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,195
Tod, stop looking at me like that.

235
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,714
It's not my fault, you know.

236
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,434
You caused a lot
of trouble yesterday.

237
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,633
Oh, now what are they up to?

238
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,274
Why, it looks like Amos
is going on a hunting trip.

239
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,919
A long one, from the looks of it.

240
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,915
Well, good riddance!

241
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,232
Doggone meddlin' female,

242
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,595
shootin' up my radiator!

243
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,274
Dad blame it. Get goin'!

244
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,990
There. Well, that's more like it.
Keep runnin', old girl.

245
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:12,238
Well, Copper, me and old Chief
are gonna teach you all about huntin'.

246
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,676
Yes, sir. It's about time too.

247
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,031
Attaboy.

248
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,511
Yeah, you're gonna like
trackin' down those varmints for me.

249
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,516
Get in the back, half-pint.

250
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,592
You gotta earn your right
to sit up front.

251
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,918
Well, boys, we're gettin'
outta here till next spring.

252
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,515
Tod, honey,
what are you doin' over here?

253
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,479
Gee, I just wanted
to say goodbye to Copper,

254
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,198
but I'm too late.

255
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,238
Well, what did you plan to do
if you ran into old Chief?

256
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:39,999
Chief. I can outfox
that dumb old dog anytime.

257
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,389
Tod, now hold it just one minute.

258
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,153
Didn't you learn anything yesterday?

259
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,236
Now you listen good, Tod,

260
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,880
because it's either education
or elimination.

261
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,517
Now if you're so foxy
and old Chief's so dumb,

262
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,194
then why does that hound
get the fox on the run?

263
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,670
'Cause he's got the hunter,
and the hunter's got the gun.

264
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,115
Elimination. Lack of education.

265
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,757
If you pal around
with that Copper hound

266
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,195
You'll wind up hangin' on the wall

267
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,919
Keep your nose to the wind
You'll keep your skin

268
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,276
'Cause you won't be home
when the hunter comes to call

269
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,992
Oh, Big Mama, I know Copper
would never track me down.

270
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:26,390
Why, old Copper,
he's my best friend.

271
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,391
Your best friend.

272
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,914
Now, Copper's gonna
do what he's been told.

273
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,992
Supposed to chase the little old fox
into the old foxhole,

274
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,237
then along comes the hunter
with a buckshot load.

275
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,552
Elimination.

276
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,910
Lack of education.

277
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,070
You better believe it, Tod.

278
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,037
Yes, sirree!

279
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,112
You mean Copper
is gonna be my enemy?

280
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,792
Hey!

281
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,839
Kid, you better step over here
and take a good look.

282
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,312
Why... Why, that's awful.

283
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,668
Those poor things.

284
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,075
I'm sorry, Tod.

285
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,115
Honey, Copper's gonna come back
a trained huntin' dog.

286
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,668
A real killer.

287
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,957
Oh, no, not my friend Copper.

288
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,996
He won't ever change.

289
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,310
I hope you're right, Tod.

290
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,995
And we'll keep on
being friends forever.

291
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,674
Won't we, Big Mama?

292
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:41,675
Darlin', forever is a long, long time,

293
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,116
and time has a way
of changin' things.

294
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,354
Oh, Jiminy. It sure turned cold.

295
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,510
- I'm freezin' my b...
- Hey!

296
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,512
It's that fuzzy worm! Let's get him!

297
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,759
Charge!

298
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,558
Hey, Dinky! Dinky, quick! Over here!

299
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,551
I got him! I got him!

300
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:17,679
Do I look like a worm?
That's who we're after.

301
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,879
Come on!

302
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,430
Look at that little creep,

303
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,717
warm and cozy by the fire.

304
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,189
Let me take a look.

305
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,033
Now how do you like that guy?

306
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,395
Snug as a bug,

307
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,155
while we're out here
freezin' our beaks off.

308
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,359
Yackin' and shiverin'
ain't gettin' us anywhere.

309
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,833
We'll get that no-good worm
when we come back.

310
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,510
Oh, shucks.

311
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,839
So long, Big Mama.

312
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,798
Yeah, we're goin' south for the winter.

313
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,952
Goodbye, boys.
See ya next spring.

314
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,869
Well, look who's here.

315
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,110
Oh, my goodness.

316
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,631
I'm sorry, Tod, honey.

317
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,758
- I hope...
- Hiya, Big Mama.

318
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,990
We're back. We flew all the way.

319
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,031
Yeah, we did. We did.

320
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,792
Welcome home, boys!

321
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,759
It's been kind of lonesome
around here without you little rascals.

322
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,471
Hi, fellas!

323
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,357
Hey, who's that? Who's that?

324
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,874
This can't be
that scrawny little squirt

325
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,350
we found by the fence post,
can it? Come on.

326
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,079
I can't believe my eyes.

327
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,155
Oh, it's me, all right.

328
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,153
Hey, looky there.
He's got himself a real fancy collar.

329
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,915
Hey, hey, hey.
Just look at this bushy tail.

330
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,030
Beautiful.

331
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,595
Come on. Cut it out.
You guys are always teasin' me.

332
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,910
Hey, it's him, it's him. Squeeks.

333
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,956
We'll see ya later, kid.

334
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,952
We gotta take care
of some unfinished business.

335
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,589
I can't understand.

336
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,950
It was so healthy.

337
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,235
There. That oughta perk it up.

338
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,550
Now, where'd he go?
Where'd he go?

339
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,030
He's goin' up the drainpipe!
I'll head him off.

340
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:59,392
OK, Boomer, we got him trapped!
Let him have it!

341
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,915
- Did you get him?
- No, I didn't.

342
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,399
Neither did I.

343
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,475
Come on! Look!

344
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,472
A caterpillar under glass. Oh, boy!

345
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,274
- Holy!
- Smoke!

346
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,834
Hey, hey, how's he do that, Dinky?
How's he do that?

347
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,876
I ain't got no job
I'm a huntin' man

348
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,951
And I'd rather have a dog
than a dollar

349
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,032
So let's go banjo
ring-a-ling-a-ding-ho

350
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,873
Give a little hoot and a holler

351
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,475
Come on, Chief.

352
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:17,712
Just 'cause you're not sittin' up front,
that ain't no reason to be a sorehead.

353
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,313
Shucks, if it weren't for you,

354
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,312
Copper'd never have turned
into a good huntin' dog.

355
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,272
Yes, sirree.

356
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:29,069
Now I got me
the best two dogs there is.

357
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,832
Right, Copper?

358
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,471
Isn't he somethin', Chief?

359
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,674
Look, Big Mama! Copper's back!

360
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,510
Boy, has he grown big.

361
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,557
And look at that big pile of skins
he helped track down.

362
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,194
I know, Big Mama.
He's a huntin' dog now.

363
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:07,397
You're right. And you're a fox.

364
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:12,479
That won't make any difference.
Copper's gonna be glad to see me.

365
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,438
Well, honey,
just don't get your hopes too high.

366
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:19,115
Look, don't worry. I'll be careful.

367
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,112
I'll go tonight when Chief
and the hunter are asleep.

368
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,952
Boy, it's great to be back home,
isn't it, Chief?

369
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:41,109
Come on, Chief.
You aren't still sore, are ya?

370
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,156
Hey, hey, come on. Let's scuffle.

371
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,470
We ain't scuffled in a long time.

372
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,120
Come on, Chief!
Let's have some fun!

373
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:52,159
Oh, lay off, Copper,
you overgrown pup, you.

374
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,071
Oh, let go!

375
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,991
Dagnabit! Let go, I say!

376
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,230
Oh, OK, OK.

377
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,231
That was your trouble on the hunt.

378
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,993
Come on, old-timer.

379
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,310
You treat me like a pup,
you know that?

380
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,796
Why, I think I done real good
trackin' down them varmints for ya.

381
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,395
Smellin' and trackin' ain't enough.

382
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,835
You gotta think nasty.

383
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,117
OK, OK, I know.

384
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,599
I know.

385
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,116
Copper.

386
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,111
Hey, Copper.

387
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,475
It's me, Tod.

388
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:50,513
I thought that was you, Tod.
I heard ya comin'.

389
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,511
Boy, you've really grown.

390
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,636
You have too, Copper.

391
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,678
I saw you comin' back
with Chief and the hunter.

392
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,994
It's great to see ya, Tod.

393
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:05,470
But, you know, you...
You shouldn't be over here.

394
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,199
You're gonna get us both
into a lot of trouble.

395
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,636
Hey, look, I...
I just wanted to see ya.

396
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,553
We're...
We're still friends, aren't we?

397
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,516
Tod, those days are over.

398
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,909
I'm a huntin' dog now.

399
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,439
You'd better get outta here
before old Chief wakes up.

400
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:38,433
Chief. He doesn't worry me.

401
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,431
Tod, I'm serious. You're...

402
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:43,432
You're fair game
as far as he's concerned.

403
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,194
It's that fox again!

404
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,917
Oh, no! No!

405
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,911
They're after Tod!

406
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,434
After him, boys! Go get him!

407
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,679
Copper!

408
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,111
Copper! Copper!

409
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,592
Tod, I...

410
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,148
I don't wanna see you get killed.

411
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,117
Track him down, boy!

412
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,114
I'll let you go this one time.

413
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,869
Don't lose him!

414
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,917
There they are!
Old Chief's got him on the run!

415
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,472
Jump, Chief! Jump!

416
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,873
Chief!

417
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,753
Chief?

418
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,037
Oh, no!

419
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,678
No!

420
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,550
Tod, if it's
the last thing I do, I'll...

421
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,313
I'll get you for this!

422
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:11,949
Tod!

423
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,950
Tod? Tod!

424
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,758
Oh, Tod!

425
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,308
Thank heaven you're safe.

426
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,191
Oh, poor Chief.

427
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,156
And it's all my fault.

428
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:51,035
I shouldn't have let Tod go.

429
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,757
Big Mama! Wake up! Wake up!

430
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,831
There's trouble!

431
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,356
Tod! Well, what is it?

432
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,879
What on earth?

433
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,398
Widow, get out here!

434
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,636
Why, Amos! What are you...?

435
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,518
Where is he? Where is he?

436
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,511
I know he's in there.

437
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,352
Now just a minute.

438
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,319
You can't come bargin'
onto my property, Amos Slade!

439
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,517
That fox of yours
almost killed Chief,

440
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,795
and I'm gonna get him!

441
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:47,310
You can't keep him locked up forever!

442
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,794
We met, it seems

443
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,155
Such a short time ago

444
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,916
You looked at me

445
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,911
Needing me so

446
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:21,517
Yet from your sadness

447
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:24,518
Our happiness grew

448
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,838
And I found out I needed you too

449
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:34,912
I remember how we used to play

450
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:42,438
I recall those rainy days

451
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:47,237
The fire 's glow

452
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,629
That kept us warm

453
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,879
And now I find

454
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,428
We 're both alone

455
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:01,513
Goodbye may seem forever

456
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,910
Farewell is like the end

457
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,518
But in my heart's the memory

458
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:15,630
And there... you 'll always be

459
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:12,909
Goodbye may seem forever

460
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:16,953
Farewell is like the end

461
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:21,556
But in my heart's the memory

462
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:27,272
And there you 'll always be

463
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,150
Hold it, sonny! Back off!

464
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:11,750
Consarn it! Where...?
Where do you think you're goin'?

465
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:15,116
Oh, excuse me, I...
I was just trying to...

466
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,112
You barge in on somebody's house
like you own it.

467
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,111
Tarryhootin' around them woods,

468
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:23,112
wakin' up folks
in the middle of the night.

469
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,159
I honestly didn't know
anybody lived here, and I...

470
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,312
Well, you know it now.
Now get off my property!

471
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,152
Go on! Beat it!

472
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:38,555
I've been watching you, sir.
You can stay with me if you want to.

473
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,837
- That's very nice of you.
- Come with me.

474
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:11,075
She dropped that fox off
at the game preserve.

475
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:14,118
We'll get him. We'll get him.

476
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,758
Well, now, if you
gotta have a busted leg,

477
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:38,115
this is the way to do it.

478
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:42,034
Good food, soft pillow,

479
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:44,429
warm stove.

480
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,829
Sure beats sleepin' in that barrel.

481
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:56,395
Well, now, here comes visitors
to see the invalid.

482
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:11,197
How do you like that?
They didn't even ask how I'm feelin'.

483
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:23,271
Chief, get back in there
before I break your other leg.

484
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:29,673
Copper, Copper, lookit here.

485
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,675
Now, when that fox
comes traipsin' along,

486
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,716
suspectin' nothin'...

487
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,039
Tod?

488
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,559
Tod?

489
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:05,114
Oh, boy. These old wings
ain't what they used to be.

490
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:11,353
Big Mama,
you better lose a few pounds.

491
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:14,317
There he is, there he is.

492
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:16,759
Tod!

493
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,758
Tod!

494
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,751
Oh, hi, Big Mama.

495
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,717
Oh, it's you, Vixey.

496
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,711
Hey, what brings you way out here?

497
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,519
I'm lookin' for a fox named Tod.

498
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:31,910
- He's new here in the forest.
- Oh, new?

499
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:35,153
Well, what does he look like?

500
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:39,592
Oh, he's young. About your age.

501
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,193
And handsome.

502
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:45,272
Handsome? Oh, say.

503
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:48,397
Gee, he sure sounds nice.

504
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,119
I'm not doing anything.

505
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,191
I'll help you find him.

506
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,919
Come on.
He's gotta be around here somewhere.

507
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:21,873
Wha...?

508
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:24,474
What happened? Where am I?

509
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:42,552
So, it's you again?

510
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:45,240
You barged in on me last night,
and now you...

511
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,389
I didn't mean to.

512
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:50,268
Just look at the mess you made.

513
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:56,391
Dagnabit, you clumsy bonehead!

514
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,471
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

515
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:00,596
Excuses, excuses.

516
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,399
Mr Digger, sir?
It was so too an accident.

517
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,313
You keep out of this,
you walkin' pincushion.

518
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:11,309
You shouldn't be so grumpy to
someone who's new in the neighbourhood.

519
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,960
A stranger?

520
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,634
Why don't you go back
where you came from?

521
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,599
Wha...?

522
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,958
Well, go on.

523
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:30,270
Get goin'. Git!

524
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:00,797
Gosh, he seems so... I don't know,
so downhearted, Big Mama.

525
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:04,190
Well, you can't blame him, honey.

526
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:08,432
He was dropped out here and left
all alone without a friend in the world.

527
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,829
Well, maybe there's
something I could do.

528
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:12,831
You know, cheer him up.

529
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:16,469
Honey, you just said
the magic words.

530
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:22,919
Now...

531
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,276
What? But Big Mama, I don't...

532
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:31,194
Darlin', don't move.
You look beautiful.

533
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,679
Thank you.

534
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,478
Mornin', Tod.

535
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:37,359
Hello, Big Mama.

536
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,998
Last night was pretty miserable
for you, wasn't it, honey?

537
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,354
Just terrible.

538
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:45,750
Cheer up and look around.

539
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:48,513
The forest is beautiful this morning.

540
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:51,598
After last night,
nothin' looks beautiful.

541
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,711
Wow!

542
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:01,080
Who...? Who is that?

543
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,799
Oh, just another fox.

544
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,915
A lady fox.

545
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,638
Golly!

546
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:12,753
Is she beautiful!

547
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,271
I wonder what her name is.

548
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:20,592
Well, why don't you go ask her?

549
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:24,673
Yeah. Yeah, guess...
Guess I will.

550
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:29,919
I'll... I'll go up to her and I'll say,
"You're the most gorgeous...

551
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,116
The most beautiful...

552
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:38,231
Never seen anyone, anywhere..."
I'll say...

553
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:41,834
Hi.

554
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:43,794
Hello.

555
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:46,758
- Big Mama told me, you know...
- I just happened to be...

556
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:51,710
May I call you by your first name?

557
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:55,190
Oh, sure. Why not?

558
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:00,149
Thanks, but what...?
What is your first name?

559
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,674
- Vixey.
- Vixey.

560
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:08,153
My name is... is... Tod.

561
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:09,958
Tod?

562
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:15,148
That's a... That's a nice name, Tod.

563
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:18,630
It looks like that farm boy
is makin' it big with her.

564
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,671
Now just keep it down.

565
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,399
Well, Tod, you know something?

566
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,835
This stream is just full of trout.

567
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:29,070
Do you think you could catch one?

568
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,988
- One what?
- One what? Fish, silly!

569
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,350
Oh, oh, yeah! Oh, yeah.

570
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:38,591
My dear young lady...

571
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:43,838
...you happen to be looking
at an expert... fisher fox.

572
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,879
Oh, Tod, Tod. Don't overdo it.

573
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:52,192
I know all the tricks.
In fact, I... I never miss.

574
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:54,669
Please let him catch a fish.

575
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:57,433
Here comes a whopper!

576
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:59,869
Now, watch closely.

577
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:10,076
Tod, do you need help?

578
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:15,189
No. No, I do it this way

579
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,669
all... all the... all the time!

580
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,998
I got him.

581
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:27,669
Oh, that farm boy,
he don't know nothin' about fishin'.

582
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,995
He ain't gonna hook her that way.

583
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:32,036
Oh, gosh!

584
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:36,159
Tod, you're the
funniest thing I ever saw!

585
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:40,199
Go ahead! Go ahead and laugh!

586
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:42,919
You're like everyone else around here.

587
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:48,033
I'm sorry. I can't help it.
You are so funny.

588
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:51,157
So I can't fish!

589
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,236
You're a silly,

590
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:56,551
empty-headed... female!

591
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,073
Now just a minute.

592
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:00,913
I mean, you've got a nerve.
Why don't you grow up?

593
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:06,073
Tod, that's no way
to talk to Vixey.

594
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:10,432
Oh, raspberries! I've had it.

595
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:12,833
Honey, don't stay mad.

596
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:16,792
You gotta be natural. That's the trick.

597
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,279
Can't you see?

598
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:24,117
When you have a natural attraction

599
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:29,320
You deserve a mutual reaction

600
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:32,119
You're gonna get a whole lot

601
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:35,351
Of satisfaction

602
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:40,474
Here's all you gotta do

603
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,471
When you feel that

604
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:47,156
Natural affection

605
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:52,189
Leads you in the positive direction

606
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:55,317
You gotta stop showin ' off

607
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,789
Start showin ' up

608
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:01,714
With little old natural you

609
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:08,190
Yes, you gotta appreciate the lady

610
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:13,712
And now that is a natural fact

611
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:18,878
'Cause when you be yourself

612
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:23,833
With the lady, yeah

613
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:29,990
You gonna get appreciated

614
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:32,958
Right back

615
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,916
- But Big Mama...
- It's just getting interesting.

616
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,311
T od, I...

617
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:06,551
I just know you're
gonna love the forest.

618
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,029
Listen, come on.
Let me show you around.

619
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,678
Sure.

620
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:13,038
Come on.

621
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:31,477
Look. One, two,
three, four, five, six.

622
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:35,196
Seven.

623
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:41,199
I think six would be just right.

624
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:43,508
Six?

625
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,711
Six what?

626
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:32,474
"No hunting."

627
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:37,918
Well, now, we ain't gonna
do none of that, are we, Copper?

628
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,515
We're just gonna
get us a no-good fox.

629
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:47,434
All right, boy, get trackin'.

630
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:49,152
Smell him out.

631
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,160
What ya got there, Copper?

632
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,552
Good work, boy.

633
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:03,916
He'll be comin' right through here,
headin' for water.

634
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,948
But he won't be drinkin' any.

635
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:22,431
What a beautiful morning, Vixey.

636
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:24,829
You know, I've never been happier.

637
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,956
Oh, Tod, me too.

638
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:39,630
That does it.

639
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:42,154
Amos, you crafty old coot.

640
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:46,518
The devil himself
couldn't have done no better.

641
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:53,758
Tod?

642
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:56,070
- Tod, wait a minute.
- What is it, Vixey?

643
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:59,436
I don't wanna go in there.
It's too quiet.

644
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:01,351
Vixey.

645
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:10,239
What?

646
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,911
Tod, be careful.

647
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:01,512
Dad blast it! He's gettin' away!

648
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,318
Quick, Vixey!

649
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:12,110
Go on, head for the burrow.

650
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,268
Quick, Vixey. Out the back.

651
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:58,589
Tod!

652
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,596
Oh, no, Tod.

653
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:27,715
Copper! Copper!

654
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:31,992
We got 'em now for sure.
This is their only way out.

655
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:35,197
Steady, boy. Steady. Get ready.

656
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:36,713
Tod!

657
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:39,112
We're trapped!

658
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:45,356
Tod, I'm scared.

659
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:48,756
Quick, Vixey!
This is our only chance!

660
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:52,508
Whoa! No! I don't believe it!

661
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,876
Copper, we've trapped him now!

662
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,238
Copper!

663
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,957
Tod!

664
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:55,879
Tod?

665
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:20,869
Come on, Copper.
Get outta the way.

666
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:04,159
Well...

667
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,235
...come on, boy.

668
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:09,390
Let's go home.

669
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,391
This is it.

670
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:29,471
We got him for sure now.

671
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:34,195
Oh, my gosh!

672
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:38,708
What happened?

673
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:43,514
Hey, there's somethin'

674
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:47,559
very familiar about those eyes, Dinky.

675
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:53,675
Nah, it couldn't be.

676
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:57,117
Could it?

677
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:07,160
Bye, Squeeks. Bye.

678
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:09,151
Good luck, honey.

679
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:20,069
Ouch! You're killin' me! Ouch!

680
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:24,477
Amos Slade, will you hold still?

681
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:26,391
You're behaving like a child.

682
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:29,756
Well, for gosh sakes,
you're hurtin' my foot, woman!

683
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:33,594
Nonsense! Your foot is mendin' fine.

684
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:35,591
You'll soon be yourself.

685
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:39,639
Oh, land sakes.
I don't know if I like that.

686
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:44,513
Be careful! Ouch!

687
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:50,834
He's sure makin' a big fuss
over a little old hurt leg.

688
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,512
Copper?

689
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:14,276
You're my very best friend.

690
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:16,555
And you're mine too, Tod.

691
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:20,713
And we'll always
be friends forever, won't we?

692
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,631
Yeah, forever.
