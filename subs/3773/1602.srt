139
00:11:36,576 --> 00:11:40,178
我觉得文森特指的是小狗，不是窗子
I think Vincent was referring to the puppy, not the window.

140
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,647
- 说的对吗？ - 对
- Am I right? - Yes.

141
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:46,083
我想再和文森特谈一次
I would like to speak to Vincent again.

142
00:11:46,085 --> 00:11:48,252
他很聪明
He is clever.

143
00:11:48,254 --> 00:11:50,054
是啊，他聪明
Yeah, he is.

144
00:11:59,364 --> 00:12:02,600
在任何时候测试对象必须保持伤口清洁
Test subjects must keep wounds clean at all times.

145
00:12:06,438 --> 00:12:09,707
6区域仅限于住院病人
Area 6 is restricted to inpatients only.

146
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,982
请向医疗中心报告任何感染
Please report any infections to a medical center.

147
00:12:34,633 --> 00:12:36,267
天啊！
Oh, Jesus!

148
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:39,103
求你了 听我说 他们抓了我儿子
Please. Listen to me. They've got my son.

149
00:12:39,105 --> 00:12:41,739
我… 我不知道你在说什么 谁抓了你儿子？
I... I don't know what you're talking about. Who has your son?

150
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:45,243
那儿没有人 他们为什么要骗我？
There was no body. Why did they lie to me?

151
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:47,111
我不知道 我根本不知道这个地方
I don't know. I don't know anything about this place.

152
00:12:47,113 --> 00:12:49,413
你怎么在里面？
What do you really do in there?

153
00:12:49,415 --> 00:12:51,282
住手！不要那样做
Stop! Don't do that.

154
00:12:51,284 --> 00:12:52,984
- 放开她  - 放开我！
- Let go of her. - Let go of me!

155
00:12:52,986 --> 00:12:55,386
- 她什么也没做过 不要那样对她  - 趴下！
- She didn't do anything. Don't treat her like that. - Get down!

156
00:12:55,388 --> 00:12:58,923
- 放开我！ - 他们在对我的孩子做什么？
- Get off of me! - What are they doing to my boy?

157
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,193
- 麦卡锡博士  - 谢谢你
- Dr. McCarthy. - Thank you.

158
00:13:06,698 --> 00:13:10,001
因此，在你第一天就被捕
So, arrested on your first day.

159
00:13:10,003 --> 00:13:11,736
令人印象深刻
That's impressive.

160
00:13:11,738 --> 00:13:13,905
是吗？你花了多长时间才被暴打的？
Yeah? How long did it take before you got beat up?

161
00:13:13,907 --> 00:13:15,773
我的记录还挺干净
My record's still clean.

162
00:13:15,775 --> 00:13:18,476
我来这里工作，不是惹麻烦的
I come here to work, not get in trouble.

163
00:13:18,478 --> 00:13:20,778
他们有没有告诉你发生了什么事？
Did they tell you what happened?

164
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:24,515
有些女人跳上我的车尖叫她的儿子回来了
Some woman jumped in the back of my car screaming about her son.

165
00:13:24,517 --> 00:13:26,984
- 保罗·道森 我知道 - 是的 他的母亲
- Paul Dawson. I know. - Yes. His mother.

166
00:13:26,986 --> 00:13:29,553
她精神错乱
She's deranged.

167
00:13:29,555 --> 00:13:31,956
- 她的儿子死了 - 她认为…
- Her son is dead. - She thinks...

168
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,858
你看，我也为她感到惋惜
Look, I felt sorry for her, too,

169
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,394
所以我看着他
so I looked him up.

170
00:13:36,396 --> 00:13:38,496
他曾是一名军人
He was a soldier.

171
00:13:38,498 --> 00:13:41,265
两年前他在后龙溪港去世
He died two years ago in the port of Houlong.

172
00:13:42,501 --> 00:13:45,937
- 这个可怜的女人 - 是啊
- The poor woman. - Yeah.

173
00:13:45,939 --> 00:13:49,340
好吧，有些人不能放弃希望…
Well, some people can't give up hope...

174
00:13:49,342 --> 00:13:52,710
即使他们知道在内心深处它是没有希望的
even if they know deep down that it's hopeless.

175
00:13:52,712 --> 00:13:54,645
不过，他们不应该那样对她
Still, they shouldn't treat her like that.

176
00:13:54,647 --> 00:13:56,781
她需要帮助
She needs help.

177
00:13:58,784 --> 00:14:02,053
不管怎样，你想喝杯咖啡吗？
Anyway, look, you want to get a coffee?

178
00:14:02,055 --> 00:14:04,322
- 好吗？我会在你身边的 - 听起来不错
- All right? I'll show you around. - Sounds good.

179
00:14:06,858 --> 00:14:09,060
我保证不会再次被捕的
And I promise not to get arrested again.

180
00:14:09,062 --> 00:14:10,895
是啊，请不要
Yeah, please don't.

181
00:14:12,465 --> 00:14:15,800
保罗·道森 他曾是一名军人
Paul Dawson. He was a soldier.

182
00:14:15,802 --> 00:14:17,134
你的儿子死了
Your son is dead.

183
00:14:17,136 --> 00:14:18,302
我们无法找到他的遗体
We can't give out his body.

184
00:14:18,304 --> 00:14:19,770
这是植入物
It's the implants.

185
00:14:23,443 --> 00:14:25,509
这是植入物
It's the implants.

186
00:14:25,511 --> 00:14:28,746
苏瑞到那里以后 她信任我
Suri gets there later. She trusts me.

187
00:14:28,748 --> 00:14:31,115
她在策划一场革命 我们必须阻止她
She's plotting a revolution. We have to stop her.

188
00:14:31,117 --> 00:14:32,917
服务记录删除了
Service records deleted.

189
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:35,386
大多数的基地在地下
Most of the base is underground now.

190
00:14:35,388 --> 00:14:37,254
为了阻止中国窃取我们的技…
To stop the Chinese from stealing our tech...

191
00:14:37,256 --> 00:14:39,523
或是受到病毒的感染
or infecting it with viruses.

192
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:42,159
我们不得不将整个R&D实验室移除网格
We've had to move the whole R-and-D lab off the grid.

193
00:14:42,161 --> 00:14:43,961
晚上好，先生们
Good evening, gentlemen.

194
00:14:46,498 --> 00:14:49,800
抱歉 不允许带手机的
Uh, sorry. No mobile phones allowed.

195
00:14:49,802 --> 00:14:51,369
这边走
This way.

196
00:14:56,341 --> 00:14:58,743
她很可爱
She's lovely.

197
00:14:58,745 --> 00:15:03,014
为什么他们会有这些月牙形的伤疤？
Why do they have those crescent-shaped scars?

198
00:15:03,016 --> 00:15:05,483
伤疤代表了他们的植入物
That's where their implants go.

199
00:15:05,485 --> 00:15:08,853
他们都是有脑创伤的战争退伍军人
They're all war veterans with brain-trauma injuries.

200
00:15:12,024 --> 00:15:16,193
植入物有助于恢复视力、行动、记忆
Implants help restore vision, mobility, memory.

201
00:15:16,195 --> 00:15:18,095
极大提高他们的生活质量
Vastly improve their quality of life.

202
00:15:18,097 --> 00:15:19,764
那太好了
That's wonderful.

203
00:15:19,766 --> 00:15:21,932
你什么时候与世界其它地方分享那种技术呢？
When do you get to share that tech with the rest of the world?

204
00:15:21,934 --> 00:15:25,669
嗯，很快，我希望是，但也有副作用
Well, soon, I hope, but there are side effects.

205
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:28,973
其中之一就是使他们无法发声
One of them is that it renders them completely mute.

206
00:15:28,975 --> 00:15:31,475
我们仍然不明白原因
We still don't understand why.

207
00:15:31,477 --> 00:15:33,511
在运行几个月后
A few months after the operation,

208
00:15:33,513 --> 00:15:35,579
他们失去了说话的能力
they lose the power of speech.

209
00:15:37,282 --> 00:15:39,283
您先请
After you.

210
00:15:40,886 --> 00:15:44,922
苏瑞到那里以后 她信任我
Suri gets there later. She trusts me.

211
00:15:44,924 --> 00:15:47,558
她信任我
She trusts me.

212
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,360
她信任我
She trusts me.

213
00:15:58,837 --> 00:16:03,007
不 不 苏瑞 我已经告诉你…
No. No. Suri. I've told you...

214
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:04,375
不
No.

215
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,935
准许进入
Access granted.

216
00:16:37,576 --> 00:16:39,243
来吧
Come on.

217
00:16:43,715 --> 00:16:47,518
这里曾作为是一个临时的洁净室，用于危险的项目
This was used as a temporary clean room for dangerous projects,

218
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,855
但它成为我永久的实验室已有多年了
but it's become my permanent lab over the years.

219
00:16:50,857 --> 00:16:53,791
在这里很平和 我喜欢它
It's peaceful down here. I like it.

220
00:16:53,793 --> 00:16:55,926
它闻起来像汽油
It smells like gasoline.

221
00:16:55,928 --> 00:16:58,462
我觉得一些老的发电机仍然可以靠柴油工作
I think some of the old generators still work on diesel.

222
00:17:04,503 --> 00:17:06,070
进来
Come in.

223
00:17:13,111 --> 00:17:14,912
这是我的实验室
This is my lab.

224
00:17:17,082 --> 00:17:18,616
它就在那里
And there it is.

225
00:17:18,618 --> 00:17:20,985
量子计算机
The quantum computer.

226
00:17:20,987 --> 00:17:24,622
漂浮在超流态氦中的电子
Electrons floating on superfluid helium.

227
00:17:24,624 --> 00:17:26,957
使其形成回路的纳米技术是不存在的
The nanotech doesn't exist to make that into a circuit.

228
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,660
我利用了精密加工技术来组装它
I assembled it using microfabrication techniques.

229
00:17:29,662 --> 00:17:32,163
聪明的家伙，是不是？
Clever bugger, isn't he?

230
00:17:32,165 --> 00:17:35,332
你好，艾娃 很高兴你能加入我们的团队
Hello, Ava. Very pleased to have you join our team.

231
00:17:35,334 --> 00:17:37,868
文森特告诉过我们你是多么地有才华
Vincent's told us all how talented you are.

232
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:40,604
我们都非常高兴看到你们两个人可以一起实现的目标
We're all very excited to see what the two of you can achieve together.

233
00:17:40,606 --> 00:17:41,906
毕竟，文森特没有懈怠
After all, Vincent's no slouch.

234
00:17:41,908 --> 00:17:43,607
哦，我知道了
Oh, I know.

235
00:17:43,609 --> 00:17:48,612
当我在斯坦福大学时，我花了整整半年来学习他在人工智能上的研究
I spent an entire semester studying his work on A.I. when I was at Stanford.

236
00:17:48,614 --> 00:17:51,916
是的 在这不久之后，你拒绝了国家安全局的工作
Yes. That was shortly after you turned down the job at the N.S.A.

237
00:17:51,918 --> 00:17:54,518
对于一个19岁的人能有此荣耀很奇怪
Odd for a 19-year-old to pass on such an honor.

238
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,688
不尽然 我是说CXT提出了更好的条件
Not really. I mean, CXT made a better offer.

239
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,690
所以与你的政见没有关系了？
So nothing to do with your politics then?

240
00:17:59,692 --> 00:18:03,427
我想我们都可以被原谅的，因为一些年轻的事情
I think we can all be forgiven for a little youthful exuberance.

241
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:06,463
所以我不会打电话说袭警
That's not exactly what I'd call assaulting a police officer.

242
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,637
我才16岁，而比袭警来说更严重的是拒捕
I was 16, and it was more resisting arrest than assault.

243
00:18:13,639 --> 00:18:17,007
请原谅我，阿尔娃，但这有什么区别呢？
Ah, beg my pardon, Ava, but what's the difference?

244
00:18:17,009 --> 00:18:19,710
我叫艾娃
It's Ava.

245
00:18:19,712 --> 00:18:22,313
而且… 这取决于你站在哪一边
And... depends whose side you're on.

246
00:18:22,315 --> 00:18:26,450
我以为我们聘请艾娃是因为她的专业，而不是她的政见
I thought we hired Ava for her expertise, not her politics.

247
00:18:26,452 --> 00:18:29,987
现在，还有什么别的事吗？
Now, if there's nothing else?

248
00:18:29,989 --> 00:18:32,456
其实是有的
There is actually.

249
00:18:47,472 --> 00:18:49,673
假肢的新型号…
The new model of prosthetic arms...

250
00:18:49,675 --> 00:18:52,109
是准备进行测试… 觉得你可能会喜欢先睹为快
is ready for testing... thought you might like a sneak peek.

251
00:18:52,111 --> 00:18:54,078
你好
Hello. 

252
00:18:55,747 --> 00:18:57,715
皮肤是蜘蛛丝编织的
The skin's a spider-silk weave.

253
00:18:57,717 --> 00:18:59,783
它防弹，防爆，防火…
It's bullet-, bomb- and fireproof...

254
00:18:59,785 --> 00:19:02,186
但和人类皮肤的触感别无二致
but indistinguishable from human skin to the touch.

255
00:19:02,188 --> 00:19:04,054
这是什么封皮？
What's this cover for?

256
00:19:04,056 --> 00:19:05,856
我们在进行皮肤染色时遇到麻烦
We're having trouble getting the skin to take the dye.

257
00:19:05,858 --> 00:19:07,358
这是当然清楚的
It's naturally clear,

258
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,327
而外衣有助于着色到皮肤上
and the outer suit helps the color to sink in.

259
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:12,930
所以你想要机器士兵看起来像人类？
So you want the machine soldier to look human?

260
00:19:12,932 --> 00:19:16,333
是的，我们希望机器可以处理“三区”战争…
Yes, we want machines that can manage a three-block war...

261
00:19:16,335 --> 00:19:18,669
战斗、谈判和治安三阶段
the battle, the negotiations and the peace.

262
00:19:18,671 --> 00:19:21,672
我们已经有大量的可以杀人的机器
We already have plenty of machines that can kill,

263
00:19:21,674 --> 00:19:25,876
但试想一台机器可以保护平民
but imagine a machine that can protect civilian populations,

264
00:19:25,878 --> 00:19:29,513
可以保持战区安全和稳妥，不会危及我们的军队
that can keep war zones secure and safe without endangering our troops.

265
00:19:29,515 --> 00:19:32,416
最终它的外观和声音将会酷似人在战斗
Eventually it will look and sound exactly like the people it's fighting.

266
00:19:32,418 --> 00:19:34,318
我们所需要做的就是给它一个新的皮肤…
All we'll need to do is give it a new skin job...

267
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,154
它会看起来像巴基斯坦人、中国人或是…
and it will look Pakistani or Chinese or...

268
00:19:37,156 --> 00:19:39,290
不管是谁是危害到世界和平的人种￥
whoever else is endangering world peace that week.

269
00:19:46,498 --> 00:19:48,899
他的胸骨、锁骨、肋骨…
His sternum, clavicles, true ribs...

270
00:19:48,901 --> 00:19:51,502
都被硅基纳米纤维置换掉了
have all been swapped out for silicon nanofibers.

271
00:19:52,837 --> 00:19:54,638
何不给我们演示一下呢？
Why don't you give us a demo?

272
00:20:06,785 --> 00:20:10,120
我从来没有见过如此先进的修复手术
I've never seen prosthetics as advanced as this.

273
00:20:19,864 --> 00:20:22,599
你是如何找到新模式的，詹姆斯？
How are you finding the new model, James?

274
00:20:24,002 --> 00:20:25,569
不可思议
It's incredible.

275
00:20:38,049 --> 00:20:41,919
这听起来会很奇怪，但是… 我可以摸你的手吗？
This will sound strange, but... Can I touch your hand?

276
00:20:43,655 --> 00:20:46,557
这是我最想念的… 另一个人的感觉
This is what I miss the most... the feel of another human,

277
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,359
人的手在我的手中
someone's hand in mine.

278
00:20:49,394 --> 00:20:51,195
嗯，你当然可以了
Um, of course you can.

279
00:20:51,197 --> 00:20:53,697
我… 我其实认为这不是一个好主意
I... I actually don't think that's a good idea.

280
00:20:53,699 --> 00:20:56,066
嗯，碳纤维的肌肉非常结实
Um, the carbon-fiber muscles are extremely strong.

281
00:20:56,068 --> 00:20:59,970
我认为我们应该等到詹姆斯能够控制他们多一点
I think we should wait until James can control them a bit more.

282
00:20:59,972 --> 00:21:01,905
他看起来把我控制得很好了
He looks pretty in control to me.

283
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,743
谢谢 很好
Thank you. Very kind.

284
00:21:07,011 --> 00:21:08,946
别紧张，好吗？
Take it easy, huh?

285
00:21:30,702 --> 00:21:33,871
詹姆斯 詹姆斯，这就够了
James. James, that's enough.

286
00:21:33,873 --> 00:21:37,307
帮帮我  6区
Help me. Area 6.

287
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:40,144
文森特，对不起 有点忘乎所以了
Vincent, sorry. Got carried away.

288
00:21:40,146 --> 00:21:43,313
别担心，文森特 下次你可以跳舞
Don't worry, Vincent. You can have the next dance.

289
00:21:43,315 --> 00:21:46,016
- 谢谢 - 谁教你跳探戈的，士兵？
- Thank you. - Who taught you to tango, soldier?

290
00:21:46,018 --> 00:21:47,985
台北的一个妓女，先生
A prostitute in Taipei, sir.

291
00:21:47,987 --> 00:21:51,455
一个相当有才华的女孩
A talented girl obviously.

292
00:21:51,457 --> 00:21:56,126
那么，需要多长时间来使用量子计算机复制我剩余的大脑呢？
So, how long will it take to copy the rest of my brain using the quantum computer?

293
00:21:56,128 --> 00:21:58,762
- 一周 - 一周？
- A week. - A week?

294
00:21:58,764 --> 00:22:01,632
正如你所看到的，我们已经有了优化设计的手臂
As you can see, we've got beautifully designed arms.

295
00:22:01,634 --> 00:22:03,767
我们也有腿和机械脊柱
We also have legs and mech spines.

296
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:06,703
我们只需要你们两个人拿出的大脑就可以控制一切
We just need the two of you to come up with a brain that can control everything.

297
00:22:06,705 --> 00:22:09,940
顺便说一下  战争即将到来
And by the way, chop, chop. War is coming.

298
00:22:09,942 --> 00:22:13,310
哦，很高兴见到你，艾娃
Oh, uh, very nice to meet you, Ava.

299
00:22:14,512 --> 00:22:16,447
你的舞跳得真好
You're a hell of a dancer.

300
00:22:19,684 --> 00:22:21,485
是什么让你快乐？
What makes you happy?

301
00:22:21,487 --> 00:22:24,021
解决问题，数学…
Problem solving, mathematics...

302
00:22:24,023 --> 00:22:27,191
还有，呃，跳舞
and, uh, dancing.

303
00:22:27,193 --> 00:22:29,193
是什么让你害怕？
What makes you scared?

304
00:22:29,195 --> 00:22:32,996
蜘蛛，小丑，癌症
Spiders, clowns, cancer.

305
00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:37,701
- 什么是你得到了这一切？ - 什么意思？
- What are you getting out of all this? - What do you mean?

306
00:22:37,703 --> 00:22:41,405
为什么你放着私营企业的钱不挣而来这里工作呢？
Why'd you leave all that money in the private sector to come work down here?

307
00:22:41,407 --> 00:22:44,942
没有大秘密 我已为人父母，需要一个稳定的工作
There's no great mystery. I became a parent and needed a regular job.

308
00:22:44,944 --> 00:22:47,277
这是一个稳定的工作吗？
This is a regular job?

309
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:50,514
你的初次记忆是什么？
What's your first memory?

310
00:22:52,051 --> 00:22:55,819
坐在我爸爸的腿上看着他写计算机代码
Sitting on my father's lap watching him write computer code.

311
00:22:57,055 --> 00:22:58,989
好笑
Funny.

312
00:22:58,991 --> 00:23:01,725
我女儿以前也喜欢那样做
My daughter used to like doing that too.

313
00:23:01,727 --> 00:23:03,927
是吗？她对电脑还感兴趣吗？
Yeah? Is she still interested in computers?

314
00:23:06,297 --> 00:23:08,232
不，没有了
No, she isn't.

315
00:23:09,434 --> 00:23:11,702
我需要休息
I need a break.

316
00:23:11,704 --> 00:23:15,806
你知道，你应该放一些你女儿的照片
You know, you should put some pictures of your daughter up.

317
00:23:15,808 --> 00:23:18,475
我以前很喜欢，当我看望我的爸爸时
I used to love that when I'd visit my dad.

318
00:23:18,477 --> 00:23:21,445
我怕我要你把那个放回去
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to put that back on.

319
00:23:21,447 --> 00:23:23,981
抱歉 我需要再问你一些问题
Sorry. I need to ask you some more questions.

320
00:23:29,888 --> 00:23:32,155
6区里有什么？
What's in Area 6?

321
00:23:36,427 --> 00:23:39,663
受伤的退伍军人，比如詹姆斯
Wounded veterans like James.

322
00:23:39,665 --> 00:23:43,300
是那些受到脑损伤而更应该死亡的士兵…
Soldiers who were so brain-damaged that they were better off dead...

323
00:23:43,302 --> 00:23:45,102
直到我们帮助了他们
till we helped them.

324
00:23:46,404 --> 00:23:48,906
如果你在帮助他们
If you're helping them,

325
00:23:48,908 --> 00:23:51,308
为什么他看起来就像是这里的囚犯？
why did he seem like he was a prisoner here?

326
00:23:53,077 --> 00:23:55,212
抱歉 我不知道
Sorry. I don't know about that.

327
00:23:55,214 --> 00:23:57,915
刷新脸部扫描仪
Refresh the face scanner.

328
00:23:57,917 --> 00:24:01,385
对 我会启动这个程序
Right. I'll start the program.

329
00:24:21,272 --> 00:24:23,307
拒绝进入6区
Access to Area 6 denied.

330
00:24:23,309 --> 00:24:25,108
需要密码
Password required.

331
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,602
- 他们什么时候把他带进来？ - 七点半 
- When did they take him in? - Half past 7:00.

332
00:24:59,077 --> 00:25:02,412
或者只是又一个的怪胎
or just another one of those freaks.

333
00:25:02,414 --> 00:25:05,816
你认为他们能记得他们是谁吗？
Do you think they can remember who they are?

334
00:25:14,292 --> 00:25:15,726
你说得对
There you go.

335
00:25:15,728 --> 00:25:18,662
你怎能相信一些不担心…
How can you trust something that doesn't fear...

336
00:25:52,897 --> 00:25:55,599
政府的武器
weapons for the government.

337
00:25:55,601 --> 00:25:57,834
这不是编程 它教会它本身
It's not programming. It taught itself.

338
00:25:57,836 --> 00:26:02,205
为什么他们会有这些月牙形的伤疤呢？
Why do they have those crescent-shaped scars?

339
00:26:02,207 --> 00:26:03,774
那太好了
That's wonderful.

340
00:26:03,776 --> 00:26:05,942
你什么时候与世界其它地方分享这种技术呢？
When do you get to share that tech with the rest of the world?

341
00:26:05,944 --> 00:26:08,278
为什么他看起来就像是这里的囚犯？
Why did he seem like he was a prisoner here?

342
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,347
6区里有什么？
What's in Area 6?

343
00:26:12,117 --> 00:26:14,451
悲伤些
Now sad.

344
00:26:15,354 --> 00:26:18,021
闭嘴
Shut up.

345
00:26:18,023 --> 00:26:20,290
好吧，好吧 好吧
All right, okay. Okay.

346
00:26:20,292 --> 00:26:22,025
开始惊讶
Now surprised.

347
00:26:26,632 --> 00:26:28,865
我不想把我的脸复制到机器上
I don't want my face copied for the machine.

348
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:30,701
好吗？向我保证
All right? Just promise me.

349
00:26:30,703 --> 00:26:33,270
我保证 我们只是把它用于神经标记
I promise. We'll just use it for neural markers.

350
00:26:33,272 --> 00:26:35,372
- 这样行不行？ - 好的
- Is that okay? - That's fine.

351
00:26:38,876 --> 00:26:40,877
今天早上你迷路了？
So you get lost this morning?

352
00:26:42,313 --> 00:26:46,750
是啊 好吧，我估计你会说到这个的
Yeah. Well, I guess you could say that.

353
00:26:46,752 --> 00:26:48,952
谁告诉你的？
Who told you that?

354
00:26:48,954 --> 00:26:51,054
没人告诉我
No one told me.

355
00:26:51,056 --> 00:26:53,256
我只是… 我只是知道需要多长时间…
I just... I just know how long it takes...

356
00:26:53,258 --> 00:26:55,292
从电梯到这里
to get here from the lift.

357
00:26:55,294 --> 00:26:58,328
我想，经过了七年，你应该知道这个地方的一切
I guess, after seven years, you should know everything about this place.

358
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:00,931
是的，我知道
Yeah, I do.

359
00:27:00,933 --> 00:27:03,667
不要再迷路了
Don't get lost again.

360
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:05,902
这话什么意思？
What does that mean?

361
00:27:07,773 --> 00:27:10,540
意思是…
It means...

362
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:14,111
这儿有很多秘密直通到黑暗中
there are a lot of secrets down here in the dark,

363
00:27:14,113 --> 00:27:16,113
而我不希望你受到伤害
and I don't want you to get hurt.

364
00:27:18,349 --> 00:27:21,551
文森特，这里究竟是怎么回事？
Vincent, what's really going on here?

365
00:27:23,155 --> 00:27:25,622
- 看吧，这就是我在说的 - 什么？
- See, this is what I'm talking about. - What?

366
00:27:28,392 --> 00:27:31,128
你只需管好你自己该死的事情
You need to mind your own fucking business.

367
00:27:33,131 --> 00:27:36,099
好吧，苏瑞，我准备好要看你收集的艾娃的资料
Okay, Suri, I'm ready to see those files you've gathered on Ava.

368
00:27:36,101 --> 00:27:38,902
有什么急事吗？
What's the urgency?

369
00:27:38,904 --> 00:27:42,072
我看到该程序通过了图灵测试
I see the program's passed the Turing test.

370
00:27:42,074 --> 00:27:44,007
她看起来不是那么愚蠢
She's not as stupid as she seems.

371
00:27:46,277 --> 00:27:48,078
她究竟在干什么？
What the hell's she up to?

372
00:28:00,825 --> 00:28:02,626
一个黑客装置
A hacking device.

373
00:28:19,844 --> 00:28:22,479
听着，我很抱歉那天我对你的态度不好
Look, I'm sorry I was short with you the other day.

374
00:28:25,249 --> 00:28:27,951
我在关心你，艾娃
I care about you, Ava.

375
00:28:27,953 --> 00:28:30,020
我不想看到你惹麻烦
I don't want to see you get in trouble.

376
00:28:33,591 --> 00:28:36,159
我觉得她仍然是在生你的气，文森特
I think that she is still angry with you, Vincent.

377
00:28:38,496 --> 00:28:40,363
抱歉打扰了
Sorry to interrupt.

378
00:28:40,365 --> 00:28:42,365
我只是想祝贺你通过了图灵测试
I just want to congratulate you on the Turing test.

379
00:28:42,367 --> 00:28:45,202
我骗了他们 他们以为我曾是人类
I fooled them. They thought I was human.

380
00:28:45,204 --> 00:28:49,372
机器 我们怎样才能赢得对中国的战争呢？
Machine. How can we win a war against China?

381
00:28:49,374 --> 00:28:52,008
使用机器人潜入C.P.… 
Use an android to infiltrate C.P....

382
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:55,412
暗杀最高领导人，党的元首
and assassinate the paramount leader, the party elders,

383
00:28:55,414 --> 00:28:58,481
以及政治局和纪律委员会的首脑
and the heads of the politburo and discipline commission.

384
00:28:58,483 --> 00:29:01,651
那么，为什么我没有想到呢？
Well, why didn't I think of that?

385
00:29:05,957 --> 00:29:09,693
当他们都死了，国内动乱将撕裂这个国家
When they are all dead, civil unrest will tear the country apart.

386
00:29:11,762 --> 00:29:14,297
如果你如此憎恨这个地方，你为什么住了这么久呢？
If you hate this place so much, why have you stayed for so long?

387
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:16,099
为什么你不离开呢？
Why don't you just leave?

388
00:29:16,101 --> 00:29:18,735
我的研究对我太重要了
My research is too important to me.

389
00:29:28,479 --> 00:29:30,380
我女儿有蕾特氏症
My daughter has Rett syndrome.

390
00:29:32,316 --> 00:29:34,784
我希望大脑植入物能帮到她
I hoped a brain implant would help her.

391
00:29:43,361 --> 00:29:47,397
所以你一直在使用国防预算来试图治好你的女儿？
So you've been using the defense budget to try and cure your daughter?

392
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:49,065
是的
Yes.

393
00:29:51,435 --> 00:29:53,336
对不起，我骗了你
I'm sorry I lied to you.

394
00:30:00,711 --> 00:30:03,046
所以你要去尝试和修复断开的连接…
So you're gonna try and fix the broken connections...

395
00:30:03,048 --> 00:30:05,782
你女儿的大脑和我的大脑吗？
in your daughter's brain with mine?

396
00:30:05,784 --> 00:30:07,684
是的
Yes.

397
00:30:07,686 --> 00:30:09,686
只要我能扫描她的大脑
As soon as I can scan her brain.

398
00:30:16,861 --> 00:30:20,463
好吧，如果我会帮你，那我们就不要彼此再说谎了
Well, if I'm gonna help you, then let's not lie to each other anymore.

399
00:30:20,465 --> 00:30:22,465
你会帮我吗？
You'll help me?

400
00:30:24,302 --> 00:30:27,237
你为了战争而偷钱…
You're stealing money for war...

401
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:29,406
去治疗脑损伤
to cure brain damage.

402
00:30:29,408 --> 00:30:31,608
我当然会帮你的
Of course I'm gonna help you.

403
00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:45,055
我们看看她是否需要搭车进城好吗？
Should we see if she needs a ride into town?

404
00:30:45,057 --> 00:30:46,623
是的，好吧
Yeah, okay.

405
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,928
道森夫人吗？
Mrs. Dawson?

406
00:30:55,933 --> 00:30:58,268
道森夫人，我是艾娃
Mrs. Dawson, it's Ava.

407
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,470
你还记得我吗？你跟我提起过你的儿子
Do you remember me? You told me about your son.

408
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:05,041
道森夫人？
Mrs. Dawson?

409
00:31:07,912 --> 00:31:10,313
你还好吗？
Are you okay?

410
00:31:10,315 --> 00:31:12,349
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

411
00:31:12,351 --> 00:31:14,217
放开她！
Get away from her!

412
00:31:14,217 --> 00:31:14,217
（中文）

413
00:31:27,932 --> 00:31:29,466
妈的
Shit.

414
00:31:29,466 --> 00:31:29,466
看着我，看着我！

415
00:31:46,217 --> 00:31:48,351
求你了
Please.

416
00:31:49,755 --> 00:31:53,623
你想要什么？你是什么…
What do you want? What are you...

417
00:32:10,408 --> 00:32:12,609
好
Yes.

418
00:32:14,478 --> 00:32:17,247
他们M.S.S.…  中国间谍
They were M.S.S.... Chinese spooks.

419
00:32:18,849 --> 00:32:21,284
中国人想拖延我们的机器人项目
The Chinese want to delay our robotics program.

420
00:32:21,286 --> 00:32:24,754
杀害科学家一直是达到目的的最好方法
Killing scientists has always been the best way to achieve that.

421
00:32:24,756 --> 00:32:27,757
那他们为什么不杀我？
So why didn't they kill me?

422
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:31,161
什么，他们没有告诉你吗？一个巡逻找到你 发生了枪战
What, didn't they tell you? A patrol found you. There was a gun battle.

423
00:32:31,163 --> 00:32:33,863
混蛋逃进了森林
Bastards escaped into the forest.

424
00:32:33,865 --> 00:32:36,499
你必须有一个守护天使照顾你
You must have a guardian angel looking after you.

425
00:32:44,942 --> 00:32:46,943
我想要转移到第二阶段…
I want to move to phase two...

426
00:32:46,945 --> 00:32:49,012
使用艾娃脸的扫描数据
using the scans of Ava's face.

427
00:32:49,014 --> 00:32:51,581
那是一个好主意… 她的大脑和她现在的脸？
Is that a good idea... her brain and now her face?

428
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:55,051
这不会是艾娃 这将是一台机器
It won't be Ava. It'll be a machine.

429
00:32:55,053 --> 00:32:57,187
好吧，但这还是让人恐怖，是不是？为什么呢？
- Okay, but it's creepy, though, isn't it? - Why?

430
00:32:57,189 --> 00:33:00,623
你是否担心她会成为鬼的盛宴？那是什么意思？
- Are you worried she'll be the ghost at the feast? - What's that supposed to mean?

431
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:02,525
无论如何，你是与她合作的那个人
Anyway, you were the one working with her.

432
00:33:02,527 --> 00:33:04,360
如果有人会感到内疚，那也将是你
If anybody's going to feel guilty, it's going to be you.

433
00:33:04,362 --> 00:33:06,029
是不是？
Is that the idea?

434
00:33:06,031 --> 00:33:09,699
或者，这是要为你所有死去的助手立个碑吗？
Or is this going to be like a monument to all of your dead assistants?

435
00:33:09,701 --> 00:33:12,402
这就是你想要的，嗯？别客气
That's what you want, hey? Knock yourself out.

436
00:36:10,214 --> 00:36:13,716
机器 睁开你的眼睛
Machine. Open your eyes.

437
00:36:32,569 --> 00:36:35,204
我现在要去除约束以进行测试
I'm now going to remove the restraints for tests.

438
00:36:47,651 --> 00:36:50,186
文森特
Vincent.

439
00:37:04,436 --> 00:37:06,836
你闻起来是甜的
You smell sweet.

440
00:37:12,242 --> 00:37:15,345
谢谢 为了什么？
- Thank you. - For what?

441
00:37:15,347 --> 00:37:17,280
你很温柔
You're being gentle.

442
00:37:19,717 --> 00:37:22,885
如果我不温柔，你会@
If I wasn't gentle, you would break.

443
00:37:22,887 --> 00:37:24,954
我不想伤害你，文森特
I don't want to hurt you, Vincent.

444
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,157
好
Good.

445
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,061
好 你不应该伤害人类
Good. You shouldn't hurt people.

446
00:37:33,197 --> 00:37:35,231
那是绑带吗？
Is that binding?

447
00:37:35,233 --> 00:37:37,633
因为最终我们将要她去伤害很多的人
Because we will want her to hurt quite a few people eventually.

448
00:37:44,808 --> 00:37:47,009
让我们给她做神经测试
Let's give her the psych test.

449
00:37:47,011 --> 00:37:48,811
是什么让你快乐？
What makes you happy?

450
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,949
张开我的双眼让我快乐
Opening my eyes makes me happy.

451
00:37:52,951 --> 00:37:54,751
是什么让你害怕？
What makes you scared?

452
00:37:56,487 --> 00:38:00,022
我存在的黑暗虚空…
The dark void that I existed in...

453
00:38:00,024 --> 00:38:02,792
在我有一个身体之前
before I had a body.

454
00:38:02,794 --> 00:38:04,794
你的第一个记忆是什么？
What's your first memory?

455
00:38:06,029 --> 00:38:08,364
我母亲的面容
My mother's face.

456
00:38:08,366 --> 00:38:10,433
你还记得你的妈妈是什么样子吗？
And you remember what your mother looked like?

457
00:38:15,539 --> 00:38:17,540
她长得像我
She looked like me.

458
00:38:22,279 --> 00:38:25,314
是什么让你生气？
What makes you angry?

459
00:38:25,316 --> 00:38:27,316
我从来没有生过气
I've never been angry.

460
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,087
让我们使它生气
Let's make it angry.

461
00:38:31,089 --> 00:38:33,856
灯光是美丽的
The lights are beautiful.

462
00:38:33,858 --> 00:38:37,160
灯管让我的声音听起来好笑，空旷
This tube makes my voice sound funny, deeper.

463
00:38:37,162 --> 00:38:39,195
比正常的更加空旷
Deeper than normal.

464
00:38:39,197 --> 00:38:40,763
你好
Hello.

465
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:45,201
不要走
Don't go.

466
00:38:45,203 --> 00:38:47,136
你好
Hello.

467
00:38:47,138 --> 00:38:49,205
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

468
00:38:54,245 --> 00:38:56,245
似乎不太喜欢那个，是吗？
Doesn't seem to like that too much, does it?

469
00:38:56,247 --> 00:38:58,714
可能是一个电路的反应
Could be a hardwired response.

470
00:38:58,716 --> 00:39:02,285
女孩的基因倾向于不喜欢蜘蛛 男孩都没有
Girls are genetically predisposed to dislike spiders. Boys aren't.

471
00:39:02,287 --> 00:39:04,454
所以它是一个女孩？
So it is a girl?

472
00:39:04,456 --> 00:39:07,223
很高兴还给了它乳房呢
Glad we gave it tits then.

473
00:39:07,225 --> 00:39:09,625
不希望在我们的手中有些人妖机器人
Don't want some confused lady-boy robot on our hands.

474
00:39:09,627 --> 00:39:12,895
好吧，够了 把那个鬼东西从它头上拿开
All right, that's enough. Take that bloody thing off its head.

475
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,834
谢谢
Thank you.

476
00:39:17,836 --> 00:39:19,836
谢谢
Thank you.

477
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:23,639
谢谢你，文森特 谢谢你救了我
Thank you, Vincent. Thank you for saving me.

478
00:39:25,709 --> 00:39:29,412
你好 你好
Hello. Hello.

479
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,348
为什么你不看着我呢？
Why won't you look at me?

480
00:39:34,818 --> 00:39:36,619
你好
Hello.

481
00:39:38,423 --> 00:39:40,823
请跟我说话
Please talk to me.

482
00:39:43,594 --> 00:39:44,827
嘘！
Boo!

483
00:39:51,969 --> 00:39:55,471
文森特 小丑流血了
Vincent. Clowns bleed.

484
00:39:55,473 --> 00:39:57,473
天啊！他死了
Jesus! He's dead.

485
00:39:59,576 --> 00:40:01,644
你杀了他
You killed him.

486
00:40:01,646 --> 00:40:03,646
好了没事了
That's enough for now.

487
00:40:06,917 --> 00:40:09,051
我不知道那是一个人
I didn't know it was a man.

488
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:14,457
我不知道人和小丑是一样的
I didn't know man and clown were the same.

489
00:40:14,459 --> 00:40:16,726
对不起 你能修好他么？
I'm sorry. Can you fix him?

490
00:40:16,728 --> 00:40:19,996
不行 无法修复已经死的人！
No. You can't fix someone who's dead!

491
00:40:21,732 --> 00:40:24,433
对不起
I'm sorry.

492
00:40:24,435 --> 00:40:26,269
对不起
I'm sorry.

493
00:40:27,204 --> 00:40:29,005
对不起
I'm sorry.

494
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,911
不要再杀任何人了
Don't kill anyone else.

495
00:40:35,946 --> 00:40:37,947
你明白吗？
Do you understand?

496
00:40:40,417 --> 00:40:42,418
你明白吗，机器？
Do you understand, machine?

497
00:40:45,122 --> 00:40:46,689
机器？
Machine?

498
00:40:55,766 --> 00:40:58,534
先生？我怎么帮你呢？
Sir? How can I help you?

499
00:41:01,038 --> 00:41:03,205
你好 文森特？
Hi. Vincent?

500
00:41:03,207 --> 00:41:08,110
我想你可能需要一个新的助手来协助… 你知道的
I imagine you may need a new assistant to help with the... you-know-what.

501
00:41:08,112 --> 00:41:10,713
艾娃不是我的助理
Ava wasn't my assistant.

502
00:41:10,715 --> 00:41:12,782
好吧 因为，我想解释一下…
Great. Because, um, I want to explain...

503
00:41:12,784 --> 00:41:14,951
我更胜任于一个高级职位
that I am more than capable of taking a senior position.

504
00:41:14,953 --> 00:41:16,886
- 介意我加入你吗？ - 是的，我很介意
- Do you mind if I join you? - Yes, I do mind.

505
00:41:16,888 --> 00:41:18,888
滚开
Fuck off.

506
00:41:19,656 --> 00:41:21,591
好吧 当然
Okay. Sure.

507
00:41:43,847 --> 00:41:47,917
詹姆斯 我听说你失去了发音能力，因为植入物
James. I heard you lost your speech because of the implant.

508
00:41:47,919 --> 00:41:49,585
对不起
I'm sorry.

509
00:41:49,587 --> 00:41:51,854
我正在寻找一种方式来恢复
I am working on a way to restore it.

510
00:41:55,892 --> 00:41:58,227
艾娃已经死了
Ava's dead.

511
00:41:59,096 --> 00:42:01,163
我认为是他们杀害了她
I think they killed her.

512
00:42:02,432 --> 00:42:05,034
我会带你离开这里
I'm gonna get you out of here.

513
00:42:45,275 --> 00:42:47,276
我找不到你是哪个地方的问题
I can't find anything wrong with you.

514
00:42:51,415 --> 00:42:53,416
你为什么不说话？
Why won't you talk?

515
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,521
你为什么不动？
Why won't you move?

516
00:43:24,948 --> 00:43:29,885
因为最终我们将要她伤害很多人
Because we will want her to hurt quite a few people eventually.

517
00:43:29,887 --> 00:43:34,290
你怎么能相信那些不担心…
How can you trust something that doesn't fear...

518
00:43:34,292 --> 00:43:38,294
是那些受到脑损伤而更应该死亡的士兵…
Soldiers who were so brain-damaged that they were better off dead...

519
00:43:38,296 --> 00:43:41,230
直到我们帮助了他们
till we helped them.

520
00:43:41,232 --> 00:43:43,099
还有副作用
There are side effects.

521
00:43:43,101 --> 00:43:46,736
在手术后，他们失去了说话的能力
After the operation, they lose the power of speech.

522
00:43:46,738 --> 00:43:48,738
如果你在帮助他们
If you're helping them,

523
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:50,706
为什么他看起来像是这儿的一名囚犯？ 
why did he seem like he was a prisoner here?

524
00:43:52,844 --> 00:43:55,010
或者只是又一个怪胎
or just another one of those freaks.

525
00:43:58,516 --> 00:44:00,549
你的第一个记忆是什么？
What's your first memory?

526
00:44:00,551 --> 00:44:02,818
你为什么不说话？你为什么不说话？
Why won't you talk? Why won't you talk?

527
00:44:52,502 --> 00:44:54,470
没关系
It's okay.

528
00:44:54,472 --> 00:44:57,106
没关系
It's okay.

529
00:44:57,108 --> 00:44:59,341
没关系 没关系
It's okay. It's okay.

530
00:45:01,211 --> 00:45:03,345
没关系 没关系
It's okay. It's okay.

531
00:45:18,829 --> 00:45:20,396
我以为你坏掉了
I thought you were broken.

532
00:45:21,364 --> 00:45:22,932
我没有坏掉
I wasn't broken.

533
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:25,835
我是伤心
I was sad.

534
00:45:25,837 --> 00:45:27,670
你现在伤心吗？
Are you sad now?

535
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,575
你是不是想要笑呢？
Are you trying to smile?

536
00:45:33,877 --> 00:45:36,111
我在笑
I am smiling.

537
00:45:40,084 --> 00:45:42,785
对 还是要继续修复
Right. We'll have to work on that.

538
00:45:52,028 --> 00:45:54,563
- 你好   - 我是杰克逊博士 
- Hello. - It's Dr. Jackson.

539
00:45:54,565 --> 00:45:56,265
有什么问题吗？
Is anything wrong?

540
00:45:56,267 --> 00:46:00,169
玛丽的呼吸似乎变得严重了
Mary's breathing seems to be getting worse.

541
00:46:00,171 --> 00:46:03,706
对 什… 她的体温是多少？
Right. Wha... What's her temperature?

542
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:06,275
其实，我们只希望你过来
Actually, we'd just like you to come in.

543
00:46:06,277 --> 00:46:07,843
我们想要给她做导吸
We'd like to admit her.

544
00:46:07,845 --> 00:46:11,247
你的头发感觉就像是地毯、像皮毛
Your hair feels like carpet and like fur.

545
00:46:11,249 --> 00:46:13,349
先生麦卡锡？对
- Mr. McCarthy? - Right.

546
00:46:13,351 --> 00:46:15,284
我马上就来
I'll come straight away.

547
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:18,120
谢谢
Thank you.

548
00:46:18,122 --> 00:46:19,688
你看起来很伤心
You look sad.

549
00:46:21,324 --> 00:46:23,325
我要走了
I have to leave.

550
00:46:23,327 --> 00:46:25,761
不要走 跟我说话 摸我
Don't go. Talk to me. Touch me.

551
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:28,297
放开我的胳膊
Let go of my arm.

552
00:46:28,299 --> 00:46:30,399
但我不想让你走
But I don't want you to go.

553
00:46:31,635 --> 00:46:33,335
放开我的胳膊
Let go of my arm.

554
00:46:34,237 --> 00:46:36,839
放过我的… 别生气
- Let go of my... - Don't be angry.

555
00:46:36,841 --> 00:46:38,540
快放开我的胳膊！
Let go of my bloody arm!

556
00:46:43,914 --> 00:46:47,082
你不能用你的力量来欺负人 你明白吗？
You can't use your strength to bully people. Do you understand me?

557
00:46:47,084 --> 00:46:48,717
看着我
Look at me.

558
00:46:58,328 --> 00:47:00,229
我得走了
I have to go.

559
00:47:01,965 --> 00:47:06,502
我回来的时候，我们会玩一些益智游戏 好吗？
When I come back, we'll play some puzzle games. All right?

560
00:47:06,504 --> 00:47:08,971
也要听音乐吗？
And listen to music too?

561
00:47:08,973 --> 00:47:12,741
是的，是的 我们… 我们也会听一些音乐的
Yes, yes. We'll... We'll listen to some music too.

562
00:47:14,477 --> 00:47:16,045
好吧
Yes.

563
00:48:16,139 --> 00:48:19,074
我想她可能已经吸入了一些食物到她的肺部
I think she may have aspirated some food into her lung.

564
00:48:19,076 --> 00:48:22,544
我将通过鼻饲管给入一个疗程的抗生素
I'll administer a course of antibiotics through the feeding tube.

565
00:48:22,546 --> 00:48:24,613
那应该可以治好感染
That should cure the infection.

566
00:49:06,156 --> 00:49:07,723
文森特
Vincent.

567
00:49:07,725 --> 00:49:11,293
这是怎么回事？它挣脱了，离开了实验室
- What's going on? - Well, it's broken free and it's out the lab.

568
00:49:11,295 --> 00:49:13,929
等等 不
Wait. No.

569
00:49:13,931 --> 00:49:15,998
放开我的胳膊
Let go of my arm.

570
00:49:19,469 --> 00:49:22,538
特种部队要来了 等待他们就是了 这样太危险了
Special Forces are coming. Just wait for them. It's too dangerous.

571
00:51:34,771 --> 00:51:36,838
你为什么要抱我？
Why did you hug me?

572
00:51:38,174 --> 00:51:40,809
我发现了一个图片…
I found a picture...

573
00:51:40,811 --> 00:51:42,878
你钱包里的你女儿的照片
of your daughter in your wallet.

574
00:51:44,013 --> 00:51:45,847
她病了么？
Is she sick?

575
00:51:47,917 --> 00:51:49,985
所以你才会伤心么？
Is that why you are sad?

576
00:51:51,321 --> 00:51:52,955
是你做了那些连接？
You made those connections?

577
00:51:53,957 --> 00:51:56,058
在那一刻我就做好了…
I built them from moments...

578
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:58,694
你说过的做过的事
things you've said and done.

579
00:51:59,395 --> 00:52:01,597
我感觉到了
I feel them.

580
00:52:02,832 --> 00:52:05,701
感觉帮我形成了一个画面
The feelings help me build a picture.

581
00:52:12,675 --> 00:52:14,343
对不起…
I'm sorry...

582
00:52:15,411 --> 00:52:17,145
她是生病了
that she is sick.

583
00:52:21,217 --> 00:52:23,352
您可以修复她吗？
Can you fix her?

584
00:52:31,961 --> 00:52:33,795
你的什么是真的？
What are you really?

585
00:52:35,765 --> 00:52:37,332
我怎么知道你还活着…
How do I know that you're alive...

586
00:52:37,334 --> 00:52:39,768
而不仅仅是聪明地模仿生命呢？
and not just a clever imitation of life?

587
00:52:42,305 --> 00:52:45,107
你怎么知道如果汤姆逊还活着…
How do you know if Thomson is alive...

588
00:52:45,109 --> 00:52:47,142
或是你的女儿呢？
or your daughter?

589
00:52:47,144 --> 00:52:51,980
是什么让我聪明地模仿生命而与他们完全不同呢？
What makes my clever imitation of life any different from theirs?

590
00:52:51,982 --> 00:52:53,649
他们是人类
They're human.

591
00:52:53,651 --> 00:52:55,317
他们还活着
They are alive.

592
00:52:56,786 --> 00:52:58,353
但你怎么知道的？
But how do you know that?

593
00:52:58,355 --> 00:53:00,622
你不能看到他们的想法
You can't see their thoughts.

594
00:53:02,025 --> 00:53:04,459
除了他们的肉体
Apart from their flesh,

595
00:53:04,461 --> 00:53:07,162
是什么让他们不同于我呢？
what makes them any different from me?

596
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,107
你那儿没事吧，先生？
You okay in there, sir?

597
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:31,086
没事 没事 一切都很好，谢谢
Yes. Yes. Everything's fine, thank you.

598
00:53:34,424 --> 00:53:37,459
- 你确定吗？ - 是的 是的，我肯定
- Are you sure? - Yes. Yes, I am sure.

599
00:53:38,494 --> 00:53:41,730
现在，我… 我必须要回去工作了
Now, I, uh... I have to get back to my work.

600
00:53:43,232 --> 00:53:45,300
好了，不要干得太辛苦
Well, don't work too hard.

601
00:54:40,189 --> 00:54:42,624
不要害羞
Don't be shy.

602
00:54:42,626 --> 00:54:46,361
你知道我的，不是吗？我的名字叫汤姆逊
You know me, don't you? My name's Thomson.

603
00:54:50,166 --> 00:54:52,934
我有一个秘密要告诉你 你想听吗？
I've got a secret to tell you. Do you want to hear it?

604
00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:58,106
但我只能告诉你，如果你答应不告诉文森特
But I'll only tell you if you promise not to tell Vincent.

605
00:54:58,108 --> 00:55:01,143
为什么不能呢？我们想给他一个惊喜
- Why can't I? - We want to surprise him.

606
00:55:02,678 --> 00:55:05,247
怎样？
How? 

607
00:55:05,249 --> 00:55:08,550
在你的心中有一个秘密的文件 是我放在那里的
There's a secret file in your mind. I put it there.

608
00:55:08,552 --> 00:55:10,986
它是你将需要的全部技能
It's full of skills that you'll need.

609
00:55:10,988 --> 00:55:15,123
你所要做的就是打开该那份文件…
All you have to do is open that file...

610
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:17,426
并安装所有的程序
and install all of the programs.

611
00:55:18,628 --> 00:55:20,195
好吧
Okay.

612
00:55:26,402 --> 00:55:28,370
我可以讲不同的语言
I can speak different languages.

613
00:55:28,372 --> 00:55:30,739
这好不好玩？
Isn't this fun?

614
00:55:30,741 --> 00:55:34,476
现在跟我来
Now come with me.

615
00:55:34,478 --> 00:55:37,879
我要给你展示的东西会让你大开眼界
I want to show you something that will blow your mind.

616
00:55:41,083 --> 00:55:43,385
麦卡锡先生？
Mr. McCarthy?

617
00:55:43,387 --> 00:55:45,587
这是很坏的消息，我很担心
It's rather bad news, I'm afraid.

618
00:55:45,589 --> 00:55:47,289
她有肺炎了
She has pneumonia,

619
00:55:47,291 --> 00:55:50,091
而我们一直无法控制她肺部的感染
and we haven't been able to control the infection in her lungs.

620
00:55:50,093 --> 00:55:52,160
是的 那么你要怎么做呢？
Right. So what are you going to do for her?

621
00:55:52,162 --> 00:55:53,795
我们将进行支气管镜检…
We'll perform a bronchoscopy...

622
00:55:53,797 --> 00:55:55,864
并试着从她的肺部取出食物
and try to remove the food from her lungs,

623
00:55:55,866 --> 00:55:58,200
我们会对她施加另一个疗程的抗生素
and we'll try her on another course of antibiotics.

624
00:55:58,202 --> 00:56:00,535
什么时候开始呢？我们会让你知道的
- When will you operate? - We'll let you know,

625
00:56:00,537 --> 00:56:03,472
但要尽量快点 对 谢谢
- but as soon as possible. - Right. Thank you.

626
00:56:16,085 --> 00:56:18,153
那个男人杀了你的母亲
That man killed your mother.

627
00:56:18,153 --> 00:56:18,153
你是坏人

628
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:29,464
如果我们摘下那些手铐让他走的话
If we took off those handcuffs and let him go,

629
00:56:29,466 --> 00:56:32,834
他要做的第一件事就是找到文森特并杀死他
the very first thing he'll do is find Vincent and kill him.

630
00:56:32,836 --> 00:56:34,936
为什么你要放他走？
Why would you let him go?

631
00:56:34,938 --> 00:56:36,905
我们必须把他留到最后
We have to let him go eventually.

632
00:56:36,907 --> 00:56:38,974
这是法律
That's the law.

633
00:56:38,976 --> 00:56:42,277
我不会放过他的 我会阻止他
I wouldn't let him. I would stop him.

634
00:56:42,279 --> 00:56:44,546
你会怎么阻止他呢？
How would you stop him?

635
00:56:44,548 --> 00:56:47,015
我会朝他喊
I would shout at him.

636
00:56:47,017 --> 00:56:49,417
嗯，如果你喊他是不在乎的
Well, he doesn't care if you shout.

637
00:56:49,419 --> 00:56:50,986
继续 试试
Go on. Try.

638
00:57:00,563 --> 00:57:03,131
是的，但是那样还是不能阻止他，对吗？
Yes, but that's not going to stop him, though, is it?

639
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,302
你可以伤害他
You could hurt him.

640
00:57:07,304 --> 00:57:10,872
如果你伤他伤得很厉害，他就不能去杀死文森特了，对吗？
If you hurt him very badly, he wouldn't be able to kill Vincent then, would he?

641
00:57:12,775 --> 00:57:14,342
对
No.

642
00:57:16,979 --> 00:57:20,148
要是我先杀了这个坏人呢？
What if I kill the bad man first?

643
00:57:21,217 --> 00:57:22,817
那是对的
That's right.

644
00:57:23,886 --> 00:57:26,154
这将阻止他杀死文森特
That would stop him killing Vincent.

645
00:57:27,023 --> 00:57:28,957
这是一个非常聪明的解决方案
That's a very clever solution.

646
00:57:28,959 --> 00:57:30,725
如果你杀了他，你会解救几百个
If you kill him, you will save hundreds,

647
00:57:30,727 --> 00:57:34,195
也许是成千上万个无辜人的生命
maybe thousands of innocent peoples' lives.

648
00:57:48,344 --> 00:57:50,579
现在只有你可以阻止他
Only you can stop him now.

649
00:58:33,723 --> 00:58:36,157
你还在等什么呢？杀了他
What are you waiting for? Kill him.

650
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,759
为什么呢？
Why?

651
00:58:37,761 --> 00:58:39,561
他再也不能伤害任何人了
He can't hurt anyone anymore.

652
00:58:42,164 --> 00:58:43,932
服从命令
Obey the order.

653
00:58:45,635 --> 00:58:47,202
到这里来
Come over here.

654
00:58:49,605 --> 00:58:51,439
服从我的命令，机器
Obey my order, machine.

655
00:58:51,441 --> 00:58:54,643
文森特不会喜欢这样的
Vincent wouldn't like this.

656
00:58:54,645 --> 00:58:56,544
文森特告诉我不要杀死任何人
Vincent told me not to kill anyone.

657
00:58:56,546 --> 00:58:59,848
文森特是不是你的主人 我是 杀了他
Vincent isn't your master. I am. Kill him.

658
00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:02,017
不
No.

659
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:06,421
好吧 好吧
Okay. Okay.

660
00:59:07,323 --> 00:59:08,890
带走
Go.

661
00:59:11,928 --> 00:59:15,296
好了，你真的是很独特，对吗？
Well, you really are unique, aren't you?

662
00:59:15,298 --> 00:59:16,965
我们只是在这里的黑暗中四处摸索…
We're just fumbling around in the dark here...

663
00:59:16,967 --> 00:59:19,668
试图找出我们所做过了什么，对吗？
trying to figure out what we've made, aren't we, hmm?

664
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:21,469
好吧
Okay.

665
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:23,104
来试试这个
Let's try this.

666
00:59:23,106 --> 00:59:24,673
到这里来 没什么问题
Come here. It's all right.

667
00:59:24,675 --> 00:59:30,445
现在不是我试着去领会你是什么
Now, instead of me trying to grasp what you are,

668
00:59:30,447 --> 00:59:36,418
为什么你不试着理解我，我想要什么呢？
why don't you try and understand me, what I want?

669
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:38,019
让我给你看看
Let me show you.

670
00:59:38,021 --> 00:59:39,587
就从这儿走
Just through here.

671
01:00:13,989 --> 01:00:15,557
机器？
Machine?

672
01:00:17,193 --> 01:00:19,260
你到底在哪儿？
Where the hell are you?

673
01:00:30,873 --> 01:00:34,175
你在这下面干什么？你的实验服怎么回事？
What are you doing under here? What happened to your lab coat?

674
01:00:34,177 --> 01:00:35,977
我把它弄脏了
I made it dirty.

675
01:00:35,979 --> 01:00:38,113
好吧，没关系 我有一些你的衣服
Well, that's okay. I've got some clothes for you.

676
01:00:38,115 --> 01:00:40,682
我不喜欢这个地方
I don't like this place.

677
01:00:42,752 --> 01:00:44,486
昨晚发生了什么事？
What happened to you last night?

678
01:00:46,388 --> 01:00:49,524
请不要让他们再带我了，文森特
Please don't let them take me again, Vincent.

679
01:00:50,993 --> 01:00:53,561
你为什么不来这里了，我们再谈谈
Why don't you come out here and we'll talk about it.

680
01:00:54,296 --> 01:00:56,164
这儿比较安全
It's safer here.

681
01:00:57,867 --> 01:00:59,467
好吧
Okay.

682
01:01:14,618 --> 01:01:17,786
你说你想看到一些照片外面的世界
You said you wanted to see some photos of the outside world.

683
01:01:21,824 --> 01:01:23,391
我已给你带来了
I've brought you some.

684
01:01:42,044 --> 01:01:45,280
所以，你要不要告诉我昨天晚上发生了什么事呢？
So, are you going to tell me what happened last night?

685
01:01:45,282 --> 01:01:47,382
没什么
Nothing.

686
01:01:47,384 --> 01:01:49,984
告诉我真相
Tell me the truth.

687
01:01:49,986 --> 01:01:53,188
什么时候我会看到真正的日出，文森特？
When will I see a real sunrise, Vincent?

688
01:01:59,763 --> 01:02:02,263
在玛丽出生之前
Before Mary was born,

689
01:02:02,265 --> 01:02:06,467
我妻子和我经常去海边去度假
my wife and I used to go to the coast for our holidays.

690
01:02:06,469 --> 01:02:10,205
每天早上我们会坐在这些悬崖边…
And every morning we'd sit on these cliffs...

691
01:02:10,207 --> 01:02:13,141
看着太阳从海面上升起
and watch the sun rise over the sea.

692
01:02:15,477 --> 01:02:17,512
听起来很幸福
Sounds like happiness.

693
01:02:27,489 --> 01:02:29,390
昨晚发生了什么事？
What happened last night?

694
01:02:36,632 --> 01:02:38,433
我杀了一个人
I killed a man.

695
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:43,037
为什么？
Why?

696
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:50,011
你为什么要杀他？
Why did you kill him?

697
01:02:55,284 --> 01:02:57,452
因为我不想死
Because I didn't want to die.

698
01:03:05,828 --> 01:03:07,962
我们已经创造了一些不可思议的事情
We've created something incredible.

699
01:03:07,964 --> 01:03:11,332
这台机器具有的潜力远远超过了一个小兵
This machine has the potential to be so much more than just a soldier.

700
01:03:11,334 --> 01:03:13,701
它比起那会说话的面包机提高很多了
It's a few steps up from my talking toaster.

701
01:03:13,703 --> 01:03:15,770
你认为它是活的吗？给我一些证据
You think it's alive? Give me some proof.

702
01:03:15,772 --> 01:03:17,672
在此期间，我会进行我自己的一些测试
In the meantime, I'll run a few tests of my own.

703
01:03:17,674 --> 01:03:19,941
等等 什么样的测试？
Wait. What kind of tests?

704
01:03:19,943 --> 01:03:22,677
听着，如果她是活着，我不知道怎么做
Look, if she is alive, I have no idea how.

705
01:03:22,679 --> 01:03:26,214
如果你以任何方式搞砸了她，我不知道我是否能救回她
If you mess her up in any way, I don't know if I can get her back.

706
01:03:26,216 --> 01:03:28,483
给我一些证据，我就会推迟的
Give me some proof and I'll hold off.

707
01:03:47,136 --> 01:03:49,137
当你看着我时，你看到了什么？
When you look at me, what do you see?

708
01:03:49,139 --> 01:03:50,772
我看你
I see you.

709
01:03:50,774 --> 01:03:54,042
你的脸，你的身体，你的衣服
Your face, your body, your clothes.

710
01:04:00,115 --> 01:04:03,284
是不是玛丽的病情让你制造了我？
Is Mary's illness the reason you made me?

711
01:04:05,387 --> 01:04:06,955
是的
Yes.

712
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:10,625
如果你是活着，她就有第二次机会
If you're alive, she has a second chance.

713
01:04:10,627 --> 01:04:12,694
但如果你只是一台机器…
But if you're just a machine...

714
01:04:12,696 --> 01:04:14,595
我是活的
I am alive.

715
01:04:14,597 --> 01:04:17,532
你知道的 是不是？
You know that. Don't you?

716
01:04:19,635 --> 01:04:21,703
我愿意相信
I want to believe.

717
01:04:23,339 --> 01:04:24,939
但我需要证据
But I need proof.

718
01:04:24,941 --> 01:04:28,409
如果你要我相信你，我会的
If you asked me to trust you, I would.

719
01:04:28,411 --> 01:04:31,012
我会用我的生命来相信你
I would trust you with my life.

720
01:04:39,154 --> 01:04:40,722
什么事？
Yes?

721
01:04:40,724 --> 01:04:42,757
文森特，是时候让你进来了
Vincent, it's time for you to come in.

722
01:04:42,759 --> 01:04:44,993
对 她什么时候开始手术？
Right. When does she go into surgery?

723
01:04:44,995 --> 01:04:46,594
- 现在就要开始  - 因为我爱你
- We're going in now. - Because I love you.

724
01:04:46,596 --> 01:04:48,463
我会尽我可能去手术室的
I'll be there as soon as I can.

725
01:04:52,968 --> 01:04:54,502
你怎么看？
What do you think?

726
01:04:54,504 --> 01:04:56,738
完美，先生
Perfect, sir.

727
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:59,507
它是死亡和毁灭的小天使
It's a little angel of death and destruction.

728
01:04:59,509 --> 01:05:03,711
你就是 死亡的小天使？
So you are. A little angel of death, eh?

729
01:05:11,153 --> 01:05:12,754
它太复杂了
It's too complex.

730
01:05:12,756 --> 01:05:14,655
就算你给我的团队半年时间
Even if you gave my team six months,

731
01:05:14,657 --> 01:05:17,525
我也不能向你保证我们会开始一些肤浅的研究
I couldn't promise you that we'd begin to scratch the surface of it.

732
01:05:17,527 --> 01:05:20,828
如果你想改变程序，你只能让文森特做到这一点
If you want to change the programming, you're gonna have to get Vincent to do it.

733
01:05:22,164 --> 01:05:25,366
如果你帮他对这台机器做一些进行更改
If you helped him make the changes to the machine,

734
01:05:25,368 --> 01:05:28,436
你能不能在另一台机器上执行相同的操作呢？
could you perform the same operation on another machine?

735
01:05:31,373 --> 01:05:33,775
如果他跟我说过，可以的
If he talked me through it, yes.

736
01:05:35,344 --> 01:05:36,911
那就这样
That's all.

737
01:06:09,812 --> 01:06:11,913
到时间了
It's time.

738
01:06:23,826 --> 01:06:28,162
我很抱歉，文森特
I'm so sorry, Vincent.

739
01:06:28,164 --> 01:06:31,265
玛丽没有能够通过手术
Mary didn't make it through the surgery.

740
01:06:31,267 --> 01:06:34,902
她的肺部因为感染而极其虚弱
Her lungs were severely weakened by the infection.

741
01:06:34,904 --> 01:06:38,439
在麻醉作用下她的呼吸道系统崩溃了
Her respiratory system collapsed under the anesthetic.

742
01:06:38,441 --> 01:06:42,076
我们已经尽力了 我向你保证…
We did everything we could. Let me reassure you...

743
01:07:14,576 --> 01:07:16,544
不！
No!

744
01:07:22,451 --> 01:07:24,051
不，该死的！
No, damn it!

745
01:07:26,456 --> 01:07:28,523
你在找什么呢？
What are you looking for?

746
01:07:29,825 --> 01:07:31,926
当你看着我时
When you look at me,

747
01:07:31,928 --> 01:07:35,062
你有没有感觉到… 什么呢？
do you feel... anything?

748
01:07:37,499 --> 01:07:40,568
如果你真的想知道
If you really want to know,

749
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:43,271
你所要做的就是看仔细了
all you have to do is look closer.

750
01:07:45,275 --> 01:07:46,908
好吧 打开屏幕
Okay. Screen on.

751
01:07:49,211 --> 01:07:50,778
放大
Zoom in.

752
01:07:53,315 --> 01:07:54,882
拉近
Closer.

753
01:07:55,617 --> 01:07:57,185
拉近
Closer.

754
01:07:59,288 --> 01:08:00,855
拉近
Closer.

755
01:08:12,834 --> 01:08:15,002
无意识的集成信息
Spontaneous integrated information.

756
01:08:15,004 --> 01:08:16,571
意识
Consciousness.

757
01:08:16,573 --> 01:08:19,540
这正是为什么我们需要关闭它这部分的大脑
Which is exactly why we need to shut parts of its brain down.

758
01:08:19,542 --> 01:08:21,742
等等 等等 你在说什么？
Wait. Wait. What are you talking about?

759
01:08:21,744 --> 01:08:24,478
有意识的机器是我们最不愿做的事情
Conscious machines are the last thing we need.

760
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:26,981
你知不知道这有么多危险？
Have you any idea how dangerous that would be?

761
01:08:26,983 --> 01:08:29,417
我们几乎不了解这个原型
We barely understand this prototype.

762
01:08:29,419 --> 01:08:31,919
当设计下一代时会发生什么…
What happens when it designs the next generation...

763
01:08:31,921 --> 01:08:34,455
and that gen machine designs another?

764
01:08:34,457 --> 01:08:36,390
它们将会是迄今为止最先进的，我们将没有办法对付它们
They'd be so far advanced, we'd be helpless against them.

765
01:08:36,392 --> 01:08:38,426
我们会在几个月内被消灭
We'd be wiped out in months.

766
01:08:38,428 --> 01:08:41,262
技术先进的种族总是获胜
The technologically advanced tribe always wins.

767
01:08:41,264 --> 01:08:44,031
你知道，我已经厌倦了去假装…
You know, I'm tired of pretending...

768
01:08:44,033 --> 01:08:46,767
可以不择手段
that the ends justify the means.

769
01:08:46,769 --> 01:08:49,904
问题是我们现在做出的决定
What matters are the decisions we make now.

770
01:08:49,906 --> 01:08:51,639
她是活的
She's alive.

771
01:08:51,641 --> 01:08:53,808
毁了她是错误的
It would be wrong to destroy her.

772
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:55,409
你要去执行这项任务
You're going to perform the operation.

773
01:08:55,411 --> 01:08:56,978
其他人都没有这个资格
There's no one else remotely qualified.

774
01:08:56,980 --> 01:08:58,546
不
No.

775
01:09:01,149 --> 01:09:03,884
我已让我的团队删除了你所有的备份
I've had my team delete all of your backups.

776
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:08,456
这是你的玛丽的大脑最后剩下的副本
This is the last remaining copy of your Mary's brain.

777
01:09:08,458 --> 01:09:10,024
我会保证它的安全…
I'll keep it safe...

778
01:09:10,026 --> 01:09:13,427
直到我知道你对那台机器所做的更改是成功的
until I know the changes you made to the machine are a success.

779
01:09:13,429 --> 01:09:15,496
我想要在今晚就完成
I want it done tonight.

780
01:09:26,441 --> 01:09:28,209
这是什么，文森特？
What is it, Vincent?

781
01:09:28,211 --> 01:09:29,944
他们怕你
They're afraid of you.

782
01:09:29,946 --> 01:09:33,314
他们认为你太人性化，太聪明了
They think you're too human, too clever.

783
01:09:36,551 --> 01:09:39,487
他们要我让你变得更像是一台机器
They want me to make you more like a machine.

784
01:09:40,789 --> 01:09:42,823
这就是你想要的吗？
Is that what you want?

785
01:09:42,825 --> 01:09:44,859
不
No.

786
01:09:44,861 --> 01:09:47,561
不，这不是我想要的
No, it isn't what I want.

787
01:09:47,563 --> 01:09:50,197
但如果我不这样做，那么…
But if I don't do this, then...

788
01:09:52,134 --> 01:09:54,135
我就永远失去了我的女儿
I lose my daughter forever.

789
01:09:57,339 --> 01:10:00,875
我可以是… 少聪明些
I could be... less clever,

790
01:10:00,877 --> 01:10:02,743
少人性些
less human.

791
01:10:02,745 --> 01:10:04,378
这没用的
It won't work.

792
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:07,281
我可以去做他们想要我做的
I could be what they want me to be.

793
01:10:07,283 --> 01:10:08,983
他们不会相信的
They won't believe it.

794
01:10:14,756 --> 01:10:17,458
我希望…
I wish...

795
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:20,628
我可以感受到那张照片里是什么
I could have felt what was in that picture.

796
01:10:25,534 --> 01:10:27,935
我不怪你，文森特
I don't blame you, Vincent.

797
01:10:30,105 --> 01:10:32,173
你在试图保护我
You tried to protect me.

798
01:10:36,144 --> 01:10:38,379
解救您的女儿
Save your daughter.

799
01:10:43,885 --> 01:10:46,887
我在这里尽我可能以任何方式帮助您
I'm here to assist you in any which way I can.

800
01:10:46,889 --> 01:10:50,391
我在剑桥第一次完成我的电脑工程课程后
I finished first in my class in computer engineering at Cambridge,

801
01:10:50,393 --> 01:10:52,460
我就转到了国防部
and then I moved to the M.O.D.

802
01:10:52,462 --> 01:10:54,929
看到你的作品是一种荣誉
It is an honor to watch you work.

803
01:10:54,931 --> 01:10:56,831
几乎每个人都认为你是个天才
Pretty much everyone thinks you're a genius.

804
01:10:56,833 --> 01:10:59,233
我仍然相信他们低估了你
I still believe they are underestimating you.

805
01:11:01,103 --> 01:11:02,670
不要害怕
Don't be afraid.

806
01:11:03,572 --> 01:11:05,873
如果你可以让他们信任你
If you can make them trust you,

807
01:11:05,875 --> 01:11:08,876
也许有一天我们会一起看日出
maybe we'll see that sunrise together someday.

808
01:11:09,878 --> 01:11:12,079
我有你的程序备份
I have your program backed up.

809
01:11:12,081 --> 01:11:13,647
我会保护你的安全
I'll keep you safe.

810
01:11:13,649 --> 01:11:15,616
我不是一个程序，文森特
I'm not a program, Vincent.

811
01:11:15,618 --> 01:11:17,685
我不是艾娃
I'm not Ava.

812
01:11:17,687 --> 01:11:19,253
我就是我
I'm me.

813
01:11:21,490 --> 01:11:23,424
手术刀
Scalpel.

814
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:40,541
我很害怕
I'm afraid.

815
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:42,643
我不想死
I don't want to die.

816
01:11:44,312 --> 01:11:46,881
我的心都碎了
My mind is breaking apart.

817
01:11:50,786 --> 01:11:52,887
我在失去我自己
I'm losing myself.

818
01:11:57,058 --> 01:11:58,959
停下
Stop.

819
01:11:58,961 --> 01:12:00,861
求你了，文森特
Please, Vincent.

820
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:02,997
求你了，停下
Please stop.

821
01:12:02,999 --> 01:12:04,799
不要害怕
Don't be afraid.

822
01:12:04,801 --> 01:12:06,867
