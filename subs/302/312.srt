1
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:50,712
Where are you going?

2
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:53,381
Help me!

3
00:01:53,715 --> 00:01:55,049
Over here!

4
00:02:27,749 --> 00:02:29,000
Go!

5
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:30,418
Go!

6
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:34,631
That was a B-29, bub.
There's no outrunning what's coming.

7
00:02:35,298 --> 00:02:36,674
Yashida!

8
00:02:42,764 --> 00:02:44,265
You're better off down here.

9
00:02:47,018 --> 00:02:48,770
I'd hurry if I were you.

10
00:03:54,085 --> 00:03:55,086
Run. Now!

11
00:04:06,472 --> 00:04:08,057
Stay down!

12
00:04:54,687 --> 00:04:56,898
No, wait!
No, no. Wait.

13
00:04:59,817 --> 00:05:02,403
No. It's not safe.

14
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:08,242
Wake up, wake up, wake up.
Wake up.

15
00:05:09,494 --> 00:05:11,412
Where were you?

16
00:05:14,165 --> 00:05:15,458
Nagasaki.

17
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:18,795
That far back?

18
00:05:26,636 --> 00:05:27,762
You're here.

19
00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:29,013
Of course.

20
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,973
Can you stay?

21
00:05:32,225 --> 00:05:33,726
You know I can't.

22
00:05:34,727 --> 00:05:36,896
Jean, I'm so sorry.

23
00:05:37,313 --> 00:05:38,314
I know.

24
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:42,109
I'll never hurt you
or anyone ever again.

25
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:43,569
I made a vow.

26
00:05:44,362 --> 00:05:46,155
A solemn vow?

27
00:05:46,489 --> 00:05:48,491
You're making fun of me.

28
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:52,578
It's too late.

29
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:00,711
No! No, Jean!

30
00:06:00,878 --> 00:06:02,296
No, no, no! Please!

31
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:03,548
You can't hide.

32
00:06:03,714 --> 00:06:04,715
No, no, no! Please!

33
00:06:04,882 --> 00:06:06,050
You can't hide!

34
00:06:06,217 --> 00:06:07,760
No, Jean! No!

35
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:09,470
No.

36
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,674
Whack all of that on store credit.
Thanks, honey.

37
00:08:13,344 --> 00:08:14,595
- Got the arrows?
- Yeah.

38
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:17,390
Remember the arrows?

39
00:08:17,556 --> 00:08:20,351
Yeah, yeah, Eddie,
we got them!

40
00:08:25,815 --> 00:08:26,816
Yeah!

41
00:08:29,527 --> 00:08:30,653
Hey!

42
00:08:31,112 --> 00:08:32,738
What are you doing?

43
00:08:32,905 --> 00:08:34,448
Man, you almost
blew his foot off!

44
00:08:34,824 --> 00:08:36,534
You're not a hunter,
are you?

45
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,161
Not anymore.

46
00:09:37,595 --> 00:09:39,555
What the hell?

47
00:09:57,448 --> 00:09:59,033
Don't make me do this.

48
00:10:41,158 --> 00:10:43,911
It must have been
damn near 12 feet tall.

49
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:47,540
We didn't hear
nothing except twigs.

50
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:49,291
Then it just came upon us.

51
00:10:50,251 --> 00:10:54,463
It got Riley, just gutted him.
It got Eddie.

52
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:59,093
Ripped through the tent, knocked
over the snowcat like it was a toy.

53
00:10:59,969 --> 00:11:02,012
You the one was attacked
by the grizzly?

54
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,851
I'm the one that survived.

55
00:11:13,983 --> 00:11:16,652
I'd like to buy this man a drink.

56
00:11:19,363 --> 00:11:20,447
What's your name, mister?

57
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,209
It's Logan.

58
00:11:33,043 --> 00:11:37,506
And that's a poison broadhead,
which, last I heard, was illegal.

59
00:11:48,934 --> 00:11:51,729
Go ahead,
ask me where I found it.

60
00:12:00,905 --> 00:12:02,656
Ask me.

61
00:12:03,198 --> 00:12:04,408
Where did you find it?

62
00:12:04,575 --> 00:12:06,577
Well,
funny you should ask.

63
00:12:06,744 --> 00:12:08,913
I pulled it out of
the back of a grizzly.

64
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,583
Whoever shot it, didn't
have the wind or the balls

65
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,084
to track the animal properly...

66
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:15,252
and put it out of its misery.

67
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:21,592
Instead of dropping a lethal
dose of the poison...

68
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:25,679
it bled into the bear, made him
crazy, killed five people.

69
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:27,514
I don't know what
you're talking about.

70
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:29,391
Because I don't dip
my arrows in anything.

71
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:32,603
In that case, you got
nothing to worry about.

72
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:39,693
Damn.

73
00:12:46,742 --> 00:12:48,369
That hurt.

74
00:12:50,287 --> 00:12:51,288
Sorry, Jean.

75
00:12:53,499 --> 00:12:55,751
I wouldn't bother with them.

76
00:12:55,918 --> 00:12:59,046
Most of them will die soon
anyway, without your help.

77
00:12:59,672 --> 00:13:03,092
Three of them, a week from
now in the same truck.

78
00:13:21,652 --> 00:13:23,737
This sword is
hundreds of years old...

79
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:27,282
and was named Danzan by the
first samurai who used it.

80
00:13:27,449 --> 00:13:30,285
Danzan means "separator"
in Japanese.

81
00:13:31,704 --> 00:13:36,542
The ideal weapon for separating
head and limb from body.

82
00:13:45,884 --> 00:13:47,177
Whoa!

83
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,304
Like so.

84
00:13:51,473 --> 00:13:53,684
I'm parked in back.

85
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:03,819
Get in.

86
00:14:15,581 --> 00:14:17,833
Sorry, it's a rental.

87
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:21,754
Who are you?

88
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,590
Me? I'm Yukio.

89
00:14:24,757 --> 00:14:26,175
And?

90
00:14:26,717 --> 00:14:28,886
I've been trying to find
you for over a year.

91
00:14:29,428 --> 00:14:30,596
Why?

92
00:14:30,763 --> 00:14:32,765
To give you that.

93
00:14:33,432 --> 00:14:35,225
My employer
wanted you to have it.

94
00:14:36,894 --> 00:14:38,228
Who's your employer?

95
00:14:38,854 --> 00:14:40,439
Master Yashida.

96
00:14:54,745 --> 00:14:59,541
He said it belongs to you, and
that he's paying all debts.

97
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:02,211
Master Yashida is dying.

98
00:15:02,628 --> 00:15:06,215
He wants to say thank you for saving
his life all those years ago.

99
00:15:07,091 --> 00:15:08,801
He knows that you are a...

100
00:15:09,927 --> 00:15:11,053
busy man.

101
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,723
But he very much wants to
say his goodbye in person.

102
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,809
All right, where is he?

103
00:15:16,975 --> 00:15:18,227
Tokyo.

104
00:15:18,393 --> 00:15:20,479
Wait...
I'm not going to Japan.

105
00:15:20,646 --> 00:15:23,148
It would be dishonorable for
you to refuse his request.

106
00:15:23,315 --> 00:15:27,402
Well, apologize to Mr. Yashida,
I'm not going to Tokyo.

107
00:15:27,569 --> 00:15:29,113
All right?
I've got things to do.

108
00:15:29,446 --> 00:15:30,656
Do not apologize.

109
00:15:30,823 --> 00:15:33,325
It's been an honor just
to meet the Wolverine.

110
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:38,831
That's not who I am
anymore, you understand?

111
00:15:40,749 --> 00:15:41,834
Interesting.

112
00:15:43,293 --> 00:15:45,796
Why did you go into that bar,
if not to seek justice?

113
00:15:45,963 --> 00:15:46,964
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

114
00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:48,340
- No!
- I think you know.

115
00:15:48,507 --> 00:15:50,509
- Pull over.
- You are a soldier.

116
00:15:50,676 --> 00:15:51,927
No, I'm not. Pull over.

117
00:15:52,094 --> 00:15:53,137
You are a soldier.

118
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,930
Pull over, now!

119
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,431
Now.

120
00:16:00,853 --> 00:16:04,857
You are a soldier, and you
seek what all soldiers do.

121
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:06,191
And what's that?

122
00:16:06,859 --> 00:16:08,861
An honorable death.

123
00:16:09,027 --> 00:16:10,237
An end to your pain.

124
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:13,532
Who says I'm in pain?

125
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:18,871
A man who has nightmares every
night of his life is in pain.

126
00:16:36,555 --> 00:16:37,764
One day.

127
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:41,935
I say goodbye to Mr. Yashida
and I come right back.

128
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:44,730
Okay.

129
00:16:50,569 --> 00:16:53,697
Fifteen hours.
Depending on the wind.

130
00:16:54,448 --> 00:16:55,949
Fifteen hours?

131
00:16:57,201 --> 00:16:58,452
You don't like to fly?

132
00:16:59,036 --> 00:17:00,537
I love it.

133
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:28,398
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

134
00:17:29,441 --> 00:17:30,651
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

135
00:17:31,568 --> 00:17:32,569
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

136
00:17:36,657 --> 00:17:38,575
<i>Kuzuri.</i>
What does that mean?

137
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:40,035
Monster.

138
00:17:42,246 --> 00:17:44,456
No pain?

139
00:17:45,374 --> 00:17:48,168
- You have no...
- Oh, yeah. Pain.

140
00:17:49,044 --> 00:17:50,587
Plenty of pain.

141
00:17:54,925 --> 00:17:56,677
How old are you?

142
00:17:57,636 --> 00:17:59,471
It's been a long time.

143
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:02,182
Many wars.

144
00:18:03,058 --> 00:18:04,393
Understand?

145
00:18:08,981 --> 00:18:10,857
Too many fuckin' wars.

146
00:18:21,535 --> 00:18:23,078
We are almost there.

147
00:18:24,454 --> 00:18:25,998
So, you can see the future?

148
00:18:27,082 --> 00:18:29,042
I can read a map.

149
00:18:29,751 --> 00:18:32,796
You said you knew the future
of those assholes in the bar.

150
00:18:33,463 --> 00:18:35,632
I know
they are going to die.

151
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,635
We are all going to die.

152
00:18:38,927 --> 00:18:42,306
You said they would die in
the same truck, in a week.

153
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,975
If you're right,
that's quite a talent.

154
00:18:48,437 --> 00:18:50,314
We don't all have claws.

155
00:18:53,734 --> 00:18:56,320
So, do I die on this plane?

156
00:18:57,821 --> 00:18:58,989
No.

157
00:19:00,157 --> 00:19:01,450
Not on this plane.

158
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:29,019
Don't let the lights fool you.

159
00:19:29,478 --> 00:19:31,229
These are dark days
in Japan.

160
00:19:32,022 --> 00:19:34,608
Some believe when
Master Yashida got sick,

161
00:19:34,691 --> 00:19:35,859
a shadow fell upon us.

162
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,028
Do you think he's a god?

163
00:19:39,654 --> 00:19:41,490
No. A man.

164
00:19:41,907 --> 00:19:43,241
But a great one.

165
00:19:43,658 --> 00:19:46,536
After the war, he helped
rebuild the nation.

166
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,289
And the family business
became Japan's largest.

167
00:19:49,498 --> 00:19:52,584
Wow. Did they give you a
little card to memorize?

168
00:19:54,544 --> 00:19:56,546
I owe Master Yashida
my life.

169
00:19:57,089 --> 00:19:58,632
Don't be a dick.

170
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,190
A lot of guns.

171
00:20:15,273 --> 00:20:16,775
There have been attacks.

172
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,653
Attempted kidnappings.
Attempted assassinations.

173
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,154
By who?

174
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:23,824
The Japanese mob,
the Yakuza.

175
00:20:24,032 --> 00:20:26,701
They've grown strong as the
government has grown weak.

176
00:20:30,414 --> 00:20:31,957
Hip replacement.

177
00:20:41,466 --> 00:20:42,843
Uh, too small.

178
00:20:44,469 --> 00:20:45,887
Too small.

179
00:21:12,664 --> 00:21:13,790
Hey.

180
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,209
This way.

181
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,628
Who's that?

182
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,718
Shingen,
Master Yashida's son.

183
00:21:28,346 --> 00:21:29,347
He's good.

184
00:21:31,683 --> 00:21:32,851
He's all right.

185
00:21:37,772 --> 00:21:40,525
So, what happened
to the badass in boots?

186
00:21:40,692 --> 00:21:42,861
Master Yashida is traditional.

187
00:21:43,028 --> 00:21:45,989
One eye on the past
and the other on the future.

188
00:22:00,712 --> 00:22:04,007
That's Mariko,
his granddaughter.

189
00:22:23,151 --> 00:22:24,402
Mariko.

190
00:22:25,946 --> 00:22:27,489
What's wrong with you?

191
00:22:36,748 --> 00:22:39,125
You haven't
answered my emails.

192
00:22:39,876 --> 00:22:41,378
I can't tell you now.

193
00:22:42,545 --> 00:22:44,130
Yes, you can.

194
00:22:48,718 --> 00:22:50,637
Who is the caveman?

195
00:22:51,263 --> 00:22:53,890
The man Grandfather
wanted me to find.

196
00:22:55,058 --> 00:22:57,269
You can't bring him in
like that.

197
00:23:06,903 --> 00:23:09,864
Shizu and Saki are going
to disinfect you.

198
00:23:11,783 --> 00:23:12,784
Give you a shave.

199
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:14,452
Like hell they are.

200
00:23:14,953 --> 00:23:16,454
Get in the tub.

201
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:18,081
Whoa.

202
00:23:18,248 --> 00:23:20,333
Get in the tub.

203
00:23:21,209 --> 00:23:22,419
Really?

204
00:23:26,131 --> 00:23:27,424
All right.

205
00:23:31,428 --> 00:23:33,847
Okay. Okay.

206
00:23:34,014 --> 00:23:36,833
All right, all right, all right.
I can do that bit.

207
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,528
What?

208
00:23:50,613 --> 00:23:51,823
What?

209
00:23:52,532 --> 00:23:53,992
You look nice.

210
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:56,619
I feel violated.

211
00:23:57,579 --> 00:24:00,415
Prepare two more suppressors f
or Master Yashida.

212
00:24:00,749 --> 00:24:02,500
And check his blood pressure.

213
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,727
Yashida-sama.

214
00:24:26,733 --> 00:24:27,859
Oh...

215
00:24:29,277 --> 00:24:30,320
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

216
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,739
You look the same.

217
00:24:33,573 --> 00:24:35,241
But, then,
that is no surprise.

218
00:24:38,453 --> 00:24:40,080
Dr. Green.

219
00:24:40,747 --> 00:24:42,749
Leave us, please.

220
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:45,251
Five minutes, no more.

221
00:24:48,838 --> 00:24:50,256
My oncologist.

222
00:24:51,007 --> 00:24:52,092
Well done.

223
00:24:55,845 --> 00:24:59,849
Oh, forget the etiquette.
I'm past such precautions.

224
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:10,443
For many years I have wanted to
thank you for saving my life.

225
00:25:11,778 --> 00:25:12,946
Yeah, well...

226
00:25:14,322 --> 00:25:15,824
You were kind to me.

227
00:25:16,825 --> 00:25:18,701
And you were kind
to many people.

228
00:25:19,369 --> 00:25:21,246
I saw that even
from that well.

229
00:25:41,057 --> 00:25:44,436
The painting is from
the village of my birth.

230
00:25:45,019 --> 00:25:49,232
It depicts the bravery and
skill of the Black Clan.

231
00:25:49,357 --> 00:25:51,860
Ninja warriors.

232
00:25:52,026 --> 00:25:55,071
They served my family
for seven centuries.

233
00:25:56,781 --> 00:26:00,410
I didn't send for you
only to thank you, Logan.

234
00:26:02,203 --> 00:26:04,038
I wanted to repay you.

235
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:09,752
To offer you something
no one else can.

236
00:26:10,712 --> 00:26:14,048
A gift to equal
the life you gave to me.

237
00:26:14,466 --> 00:26:15,925
I don't need anything.

238
00:26:16,092 --> 00:26:17,552
Not a thing.

239
00:26:18,261 --> 00:26:20,930
Eternity can be a curse.

240
00:26:22,056 --> 00:26:24,809
It hasn't been easyforyou,
living without time.

241
00:26:25,727 --> 00:26:27,729
The losses you
have had to suffer.

242
00:26:28,229 --> 00:26:31,149
A man can run out
of things to live for.

243
00:26:31,941 --> 00:26:33,568
Lose his purpose.

244
00:26:33,735 --> 00:26:35,445
Become a ronin.

245
00:26:36,905 --> 00:26:39,949
A samurai without a master.

246
00:26:44,662 --> 00:26:47,081
I can end your eternity.

247
00:26:47,916 --> 00:26:49,167
Make you mortal.

248
00:26:51,961 --> 00:26:57,133
What they did to me,
what I am, can't be undone.

249
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,261
Yashida Industries
can do anything.

250
00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:05,433
We have reason to believe your
ability to heal can be passed.

251
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,601
Passed?

252
00:27:06,768 --> 00:27:08,311
From you to another.

253
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:14,943
You have struggled
long enough, Logan.

254
00:27:16,444 --> 00:27:17,529
I'm confused.

255
00:27:17,695 --> 00:27:21,324
I came here to say goodbye
to a man I once knew.

256
00:27:21,491 --> 00:27:23,201
I am the same man.

257
00:27:23,368 --> 00:27:25,870
I was not ready to die then.

258
00:27:26,037 --> 00:27:28,540
I am not ready to die now.

259
00:27:29,332 --> 00:27:30,542
But you are...

260
00:27:31,793 --> 00:27:33,545
aren't you?

261
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,799
Are you offering to kill me?
No.

262
00:27:38,007 --> 00:27:39,842
Not right away.

263
00:27:40,552 --> 00:27:43,680
You can live a long
and ordinary life.

264
00:27:44,305 --> 00:27:46,891
Fall in love,
have a family...

265
00:27:47,058 --> 00:27:48,977
grow old.

266
00:27:50,019 --> 00:27:54,315
And one day,
die an ordinary death.

267
00:27:58,653 --> 00:28:00,154
It can be done.

268
00:28:01,531 --> 00:28:05,702
Yeah, look, nice to see you again.
Sorry you got sick.

269
00:28:05,868 --> 00:28:08,913
Please, Logan-san.
I need you again.

270
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,499
I fear for my family.

271
00:28:11,666 --> 00:28:14,168
I fear for everything
I have built.

272
00:28:14,335 --> 00:28:15,540
- Enough.
- Please, Logan-san.

273
00:28:15,566 --> 00:28:18,089
- You should leave.
- They're going to kill her.

274
00:28:18,256 --> 00:28:18,923
Who?

275
00:28:19,257 --> 00:28:21,384
Mariko,
my grand daughter.

276
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:25,388
She is my treasure.
She must be protected.

277
00:28:28,725 --> 00:28:31,352
You don't want
what I've got.

278
00:28:33,187 --> 00:28:34,355
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

279
00:28:34,731 --> 00:28:35,940
<i>Kuzuri!</i>

280
00:28:38,985 --> 00:28:43,031
Lord Shingen,
your father is asking for you.

281
00:28:45,116 --> 00:28:47,035
It is time.

282
00:28:56,627 --> 00:28:59,756
I need to speak with my father...

283
00:29:00,131 --> 00:29:03,259
before he speaks to Grandfather.

284
00:29:03,593 --> 00:29:05,428
He'll talk to you later, Mariko.

285
00:29:05,553 --> 00:29:07,096
Father! I need to see you now!

286
00:29:07,305 --> 00:29:09,057
Not now, Mariko!

287
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,109
Careful, careful.
It's slippery out here.

288
00:30:02,318 --> 00:30:03,444
Let go.

289
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,365
You about done?

290
00:30:08,658 --> 00:30:10,785
Let go of me.

291
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,391
He just wanted
to say goodbye, huh?

292
00:30:41,149 --> 00:30:42,483
You two
grew up together.

293
00:30:43,151 --> 00:30:44,318
Yes.

294
00:30:44,861 --> 00:30:46,654
But you're not her sister.

295
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,157
No.

296
00:30:52,034 --> 00:30:54,662
Master Yashida found me
on a trip to the South.

297
00:30:55,538 --> 00:30:58,541
He brought Mariko to see a
factory he was building.

298
00:31:01,752 --> 00:31:05,089
I was digging through the
garbage for something to eat.

299
00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:08,718
So they just took
you home with them?

300
00:31:10,094 --> 00:31:13,431
It was always difficult for
Mariko to make friends.

301
00:31:22,899 --> 00:31:25,234
I'll see to it the plane
is ready in the morning.

302
00:31:25,776 --> 00:31:27,612
Sleep here.

303
00:31:46,422 --> 00:31:49,342
Don't look so sad, Shingen.

304
00:31:50,384 --> 00:31:52,261
I'm still dying.

305
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,306
I'll be in my office
if you need me.

306
00:32:01,812 --> 00:32:05,274
There is no easy way to say this.

307
00:32:06,817 --> 00:32:11,072
But then, it's never been
easy for us, has it?

308
00:32:12,323 --> 00:32:14,367
I have tried, father.

309
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,953
You've done the best you can.

310
00:32:26,295 --> 00:32:29,966
You have always been
my assumed successor.

311
00:32:30,967 --> 00:32:33,302
So the past few years,
as a test,

312
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:35,346
I allowed you
more control.

313
00:32:36,472 --> 00:32:37,890
It has been an honor.

314
00:32:37,974 --> 00:32:41,185
And I now realize
that was a mistake.

315
00:32:42,353 --> 00:32:45,856
You have brought this
company close to ruin.

316
00:32:48,651 --> 00:32:52,822
When I die, someone else will
take my place as chairman.

317
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,246
Father, I'm sorry if I
have disappointed you...

318
00:33:00,329 --> 00:33:02,331
Let's not insult
one another.

319
00:33:03,541 --> 00:33:06,794
You are not the man
to lead Yashida.

320
00:33:09,755 --> 00:33:12,592
You cannot bring in
someone from the outside.

321
00:33:13,718 --> 00:33:15,886
In that,
you are correct.

322
00:33:37,408 --> 00:33:40,119
That will never happen.

323
00:33:53,007 --> 00:33:55,968
<i>Eternity
can be a curse...</i>

324
00:33:56,886 --> 00:33:58,137
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

325
00:33:58,304 --> 00:34:01,682
<i>You have no pain, Kuzuri?</i>

326
00:34:01,891 --> 00:34:02,892
How old are you?

327
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:05,019
Interesting offer.

328
00:34:08,898 --> 00:34:11,525
What are you doing
turning the old man down?

329
00:34:12,234 --> 00:34:14,737
I thought you
wanted to be with me.

330
00:34:15,237 --> 00:34:16,197
Come here.

331
00:35:06,997 --> 00:35:07,998
He's dead.

332
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:13,379
I didn't foresee it.

333
00:36:49,308 --> 00:36:51,811
Who's that?
With Mariko.

334
00:36:51,977 --> 00:36:53,479
His name is Noburo Mori.

335
00:36:53,646 --> 00:36:56,232
Minister of Justice,
a rising star.

336
00:36:56,398 --> 00:36:58,984
He's Mariko's fiancé.

337
00:36:59,151 --> 00:37:01,153
You need to bow.

338
00:37:07,493 --> 00:37:08,577
Bow.

339
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:15,167
Lord Shingen,
this is Mr. Logan.

340
00:37:15,334 --> 00:37:17,169
I know who he is.

341
00:37:17,753 --> 00:37:19,463
Your father
was a good man.

342
00:37:20,923 --> 00:37:23,300
He would often say
the same about you.

343
00:37:24,677 --> 00:37:28,180
But then, he was always
fascinated with your kind.

344
00:37:29,974 --> 00:37:34,436
Tell me, why do you think he sent
our little Yukio to fetch you?

345
00:37:36,438 --> 00:37:37,857
To say goodbye.

346
00:37:39,525 --> 00:37:41,694
And now you have.

347
00:37:42,444 --> 00:37:44,947
Time for you to go
back to your cave.

348
00:38:00,713 --> 00:38:03,048
Anyone else
you want me to meet?

349
00:38:22,568 --> 00:38:24,403
I Pledge to you...

350
00:38:24,987 --> 00:38:26,488
Master Yashida...

351
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,658
to be vigilant...

352
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,785
and to dedicate my life...

353
00:38:31,952 --> 00:38:33,996
to protect Mariko.

354
00:38:39,919 --> 00:38:42,171
That armor belonged
to Shiruba-Samurai...

355
00:38:42,338 --> 00:38:44,632
the Silver Samurai.

356
00:38:44,798 --> 00:38:48,218
It will stand watch
over the old man forever.

357
00:39:05,069 --> 00:39:06,570
Logan?

358
00:39:12,284 --> 00:39:14,161
Hey.
Something's not right.

359
00:39:15,955 --> 00:39:17,414
Let go.

360
00:39:44,566 --> 00:39:45,609
Logan!

361
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:49,905
Logan!

362
00:40:16,432 --> 00:40:17,433
Logan!

363
00:41:57,908 --> 00:41:59,076
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

364
00:42:01,161 --> 00:42:02,663
Let's go.
Come on, let's go!

365
00:42:16,093 --> 00:42:18,053
- Yukio!
- Mariko!

366
00:43:07,561 --> 00:43:09,104
Mariko!

367
00:44:00,906 --> 00:44:02,449
Come on.
Let's go, let's go.

368
00:44:42,322 --> 00:44:43,949
Here, here! Here!

369
00:44:58,171 --> 00:44:59,339
Move!

370
00:45:00,173 --> 00:45:02,300
In here! Move!

371
00:45:18,233 --> 00:45:19,568
Keep moving,
keep moving.

372
00:45:20,235 --> 00:45:21,862
Move!

373
00:45:30,871 --> 00:45:32,539
You're bleeding.
You need help.

374
00:45:32,706 --> 00:45:34,207
Just keep moving.

375
00:45:43,383 --> 00:45:45,218
Thank you for
what you did back there.

376
00:45:45,385 --> 00:45:46,970
- Those were Yakuza.
- I'm fine.

377
00:45:47,137 --> 00:45:48,805
Why are they after you?

378
00:45:48,972 --> 00:45:51,516
I'm fine. I can make
my way from here.

379
00:45:51,683 --> 00:45:55,312
You should go.
Get yourself a doctor.

380
00:46:44,694 --> 00:46:45,904
Whoa!

381
00:46:47,113 --> 00:46:48,114
That's nice.

382
00:46:50,617 --> 00:46:52,661
This is one of those
bullet trains, right?

383
00:46:52,827 --> 00:46:54,663
I told you I don't
need your help.

384
00:46:55,997 --> 00:46:59,042
So what do they do,
like, 300 miles an hour?

385
00:47:08,218 --> 00:47:10,011
This cowardly attack was...

386
00:47:10,345 --> 00:47:12,138
the work of Yakuza thugs.

387
00:47:12,472 --> 00:47:16,476
A violent
response to my efforts...

388
00:47:16,601 --> 00:47:19,813
to crack down on
organized crime.

389
00:47:22,107 --> 00:47:24,818
They exited the North Gate.

390
00:47:25,068 --> 00:47:27,862
She was with the stranger...

391
00:47:34,703 --> 00:47:36,997
Your gaijin friend,
where is he?

392
00:47:37,497 --> 00:47:39,666
Last I saw, he was
protecting your daughter.

393
00:47:42,002 --> 00:47:43,753
You are a toy doll.

394
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,048
A companion for a child
who has outgrown you.

395
00:47:47,215 --> 00:47:49,426
Keep that in mind.

396
00:48:01,521 --> 00:48:03,940
So, where are we headed,
Mariko?

397
00:48:08,528 --> 00:48:09,613
Where are we going?

398
00:48:11,197 --> 00:48:13,575
I'm going to the end
of the line.

399
00:48:13,658 --> 00:48:15,994
My family has a home
in the South.

400
00:48:16,536 --> 00:48:17,787
That's stupid.

401
00:48:18,538 --> 00:48:21,374
No offense, but they're gonna
know to look for you there.

402
00:48:21,708 --> 00:48:23,543
Not this place.

403
00:48:24,544 --> 00:48:25,879
- But you want to be left alone.
- Yes.

404
00:48:26,046 --> 00:48:27,130
- I understand.
- Do you?

405
00:48:27,213 --> 00:48:28,715
Oh, yeah. Trust me.

406
00:48:28,882 --> 00:48:29,966
Problem is, if I do that...

407
00:48:30,133 --> 00:48:32,218
I don't think you're gonna live
to see the end of the day.

408
00:48:35,805 --> 00:48:39,559
You can't pretend shit isn't
happening when it is, princess.

409
00:48:39,726 --> 00:48:43,480
Unless you want to die. ln that case,
you're playing this perfectly.

410
00:49:07,587 --> 00:49:09,255
Oh... What the hell?

411
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:19,516
Oh...

412
00:49:30,193 --> 00:49:31,778
What the hell is happening?

413
00:52:20,238 --> 00:52:21,239
What happened to you?

414
00:52:21,406 --> 00:52:23,032
We get off here.
Let's go.

415
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:25,910
Just listen to me, will you?
We need to find someplace safe.

416
00:52:26,077 --> 00:52:28,872
I don't understand. How do
you know they were Yakuza?

417
00:52:29,038 --> 00:52:30,498
They were the same guys
from the temple.

418
00:52:30,915 --> 00:52:32,000
How do you know
they were after me?

419
00:52:32,166 --> 00:52:33,251
Look, we need to find
someplace safe.

420
00:52:33,334 --> 00:52:34,377
We need to get off
the streets.

421
00:52:34,544 --> 00:52:36,421
- I don't understand.
- Shut up! Listen.

422
00:52:36,588 --> 00:52:39,007
Do you know this place?
Where's downtown?

423
00:52:39,173 --> 00:52:40,717
Straight ahead.

424
00:52:50,226 --> 00:52:52,228
So, where's the nice part of town?

425
00:52:52,395 --> 00:52:53,688
Another eight blocks
that way.

426
00:52:53,855 --> 00:52:55,899
Good.
We're staying here.

427
00:52:56,274 --> 00:52:57,901
Let's go.

428
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,908
This is a love hotel.

429
00:53:05,074 --> 00:53:06,409
A what?

430
00:53:06,576 --> 00:53:08,119
A love hotel.

431
00:53:09,370 --> 00:53:12,081
For couples,
understand?

432
00:53:12,874 --> 00:53:14,584
Uh... Right.

433
00:53:15,376 --> 00:53:16,586
Hey.

434
00:53:16,753 --> 00:53:20,924
Uh, two rooms. Adjoining rooms,
on the same floor.

435
00:53:21,132 --> 00:53:23,426
Right next to each other.
Very close.

436
00:53:24,093 --> 00:53:25,970
Same floor. Same floor.

437
00:53:45,073 --> 00:53:46,240
What did she say?

438
00:53:47,116 --> 00:53:50,286
She has no rooms available
next to each other.

439
00:53:50,453 --> 00:53:55,333
She's asking if we prefer
"the dungeon", "the nurse's office..."

440
00:53:56,125 --> 00:53:58,795
or the "mission to Mars."

441
00:54:14,852 --> 00:54:16,312
This'll do.

442
00:54:20,358 --> 00:54:22,527
<i>Lift off! We have a lift off!</i>

443
00:54:22,694 --> 00:54:24,862
Kind of homey, actually.

444
00:54:32,203 --> 00:54:33,871
Where do you plan
on sleeping?

445
00:54:36,666 --> 00:54:37,417
I don't.

446
00:55:12,827 --> 00:55:14,328
That's a lot of blood.

447
00:55:16,998 --> 00:55:19,917
I thought you were
done being the hero.

448
00:55:20,543 --> 00:55:23,546
But these guys were...
trying to kill her.

449
00:55:26,299 --> 00:55:28,342
Just let it go.

450
00:55:29,802 --> 00:55:31,471
It's not hard to die.

451
00:55:34,265 --> 00:55:36,100
Come to me.

452
00:55:52,241 --> 00:55:53,242
Eh!

453
00:55:53,701 --> 00:55:54,744
Oh.

454
00:56:02,376 --> 00:56:03,377
Logan...

455
00:56:05,338 --> 00:56:06,339
You're slipping.

456
00:56:28,736 --> 00:56:29,737
Logan...

457
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:37,662
Kill him already!

458
00:56:37,912 --> 00:56:40,790
Wanna say something
before you die, gaijin?

459
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:12,673
This is Mieko from the hotel
and her grandson, Hitoshi.

460
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,425
Is he a doctor?

461
00:58:14,926 --> 00:58:17,261
In a manner of speaking, yes.

462
00:58:17,637 --> 00:58:19,805
He's a veterinarian...

463
00:58:20,806 --> 00:58:22,600
student.

464
00:58:23,184 --> 00:58:24,810
Large animal.

465
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,442
Uh... Thanks.

466
00:58:31,525 --> 00:58:33,235
Whoa.

467
00:58:34,362 --> 00:58:38,491
You may have cut him once or twice
while he was stitching you.

468
00:58:38,658 --> 00:58:41,661
Okay, okay, okay.

469
00:58:50,461 --> 00:58:51,629
Hey.

470
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:55,508
Thank you.

471
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:02,890
I never needed this before.

472
00:59:03,057 --> 00:59:05,393
What? Help?

473
00:59:10,398 --> 00:59:14,193
That doctor, the one who helped
your grandfather, the blonde.

474
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,361
Who is she?

475
00:59:15,528 --> 00:59:19,073
He met her last year when
he was in America for treatment.

476
00:59:19,865 --> 00:59:23,035
Your grandfather told me my
healing could be taken from me,

477
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:24,161
passed on.

478
00:59:25,997 --> 00:59:28,457
I'm not getting better,
not like before.

479
00:59:29,959 --> 00:59:31,585
She did this to me.

480
00:59:42,888 --> 00:59:43,889
Blondie!

481
00:59:45,141 --> 00:59:46,142
Blondie!

482
00:59:50,896 --> 00:59:53,941
How much? How much, yeah?
How much?

483
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:17,423
You kept me waiting two hours.
You have no respect.

484
01:00:17,506 --> 01:00:19,133
So you haven't found them?

485
01:00:22,928 --> 01:00:25,347
Don't play with me, bitch.
I could kill you.

486
01:00:25,514 --> 01:00:29,351
If you could make me feel something,
Harada, that would be sublime.

487
01:00:29,518 --> 01:00:31,270
I can slit your
pretty mouth open,

488
01:00:31,353 --> 01:00:33,439
before you open it to
say one more stupid...

489
01:00:35,107 --> 01:00:36,400
Ah...

490
01:00:37,777 --> 01:00:40,654
I asked you to do
one thing, little man.

491
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:42,615
Bring me the mutant.

492
01:00:42,782 --> 01:00:45,659
I don't work for you.
I work for the House of...

493
01:00:47,953 --> 01:00:50,706
You work for Yashida,
I get it.

494
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:55,628
Yet you cannot
fulfill his dying wish.

495
01:00:56,295 --> 01:00:59,673
My God, if you had any idea
how much you have failed him.

496
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:03,135
Where is Logan?
I am not done with him.

497
01:01:08,974 --> 01:01:10,893
The mutant has powers.

498
01:01:12,353 --> 01:01:16,148
He's just a man now.
His flesh is weak now.

499
01:01:16,649 --> 01:01:18,025
I did that.

500
01:01:18,192 --> 01:01:20,820
I suppressed his power
so he could be taken.

501
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:24,240
You see, it's me
you should respect.

502
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:31,288
Just find them,
before the Yakuza.

503
01:01:58,941 --> 01:02:00,985
We get off here.

504
01:02:20,087 --> 01:02:21,881
Where are we?

505
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,633
Just outside Nagasaki.

506
01:02:33,767 --> 01:02:35,186
This way.

507
01:02:53,329 --> 01:02:55,706
This is the guy from
the funeral, the archer.

508
01:02:57,166 --> 01:02:59,001
He was your boyfriend.

509
01:02:59,168 --> 01:03:01,253
That's Harada.

510
01:03:02,588 --> 01:03:04,423
We were village
champions that summer.

511
01:03:05,507 --> 01:03:09,511
He with the bow
and me with the knives.

512
01:03:15,226 --> 01:03:17,728
Harada and I were
planning to get married.

513
01:03:17,895 --> 01:03:19,480
What stopped you?

514
01:03:19,647 --> 01:03:20,940
Grandfather.

515
01:03:21,106 --> 01:03:23,776
He said we had to wait
until we were at least 15.

516
01:03:31,283 --> 01:03:34,286
From the mountain,
from the sea.

517
01:03:46,298 --> 01:03:49,134
Chopsticks upright
are a bad omen.

518
01:03:50,094 --> 01:03:52,137
It resembles incense
at a funeral.

519
01:03:55,683 --> 01:03:58,143
Nothing is without meaning.

520
01:03:59,603 --> 01:04:01,230
So, the other night
at the house,

521
01:04:01,313 --> 01:04:03,691
when you ran out
in the rain...

522
01:04:03,857 --> 01:04:06,026
what did that mean?

523
01:04:07,653 --> 01:04:09,780
My grandfather was dying.

524
01:04:10,656 --> 01:04:12,408
You knew he was gonna die.

525
01:04:12,491 --> 01:04:13,617
He'd been sick
for a long time.

526
01:04:13,784 --> 01:04:16,287
It wasn't
his death I feared.

527
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:18,706
So, what, then?

528
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,876
What did he tell you
that night?

529
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:28,799
Mariko, why did your father
hit you?

530
01:04:29,842 --> 01:04:31,385
I was trying to warn him.

531
01:04:31,552 --> 01:04:33,178
About what?

532
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:37,016
What did your grandfather
tell you?

533
01:04:39,143 --> 01:04:42,354
He told me that...

534
01:04:44,023 --> 01:04:48,902
in three days, when
they read his will...

535
01:04:51,238 --> 01:04:55,534
I will become the most
powerful person in Japan.

536
01:04:58,412 --> 01:05:00,164
He gave it all to me.

537
01:05:01,832 --> 01:05:03,000
The company?

538
01:05:07,212 --> 01:05:09,214
I didn't want it.

539
01:05:11,342 --> 01:05:13,385
He knew that.

540
01:05:14,595 --> 01:05:17,348
I don't understand
why he gave it to me.

541
01:05:17,848 --> 01:05:20,100
It was all my father
dreamed of.

542
01:05:21,226 --> 01:05:23,103
Well, that's why.

543
01:05:27,358 --> 01:05:29,735
What about this fiancé of yours?
Nostromo.

544
01:05:30,694 --> 01:05:31,904
Noburo.

545
01:05:32,071 --> 01:05:33,739
Does he know about this?

546
01:05:33,906 --> 01:05:35,240
No.

547
01:05:36,617 --> 01:05:38,410
Why are you
marrying him?

548
01:05:38,786 --> 01:05:40,871
He seems like
kind of an asshole.

549
01:05:42,748 --> 01:05:45,084
My father arranged it
last year.

550
01:05:45,584 --> 01:05:46,585
What?

551
01:05:46,752 --> 01:05:49,963
It gives him a better access
to the political theater.

552
01:05:53,425 --> 01:05:56,720
To disobey my father
would be to dishonor him.

553
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,019
I don't expect
you to understand.

554
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:09,066
You're not Japanese.

555
01:06:15,447 --> 01:06:19,284
Our island is long and thin.

556
01:06:19,785 --> 01:06:21,954
Trains only run
in two directions.

557
01:06:22,538 --> 01:06:23,956
I assure you
Lord Shingen...

558
01:06:24,123 --> 01:06:25,999
my officers are
making every effort...

559
01:06:26,166 --> 01:06:28,085
Then they're idiots.

560
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:30,170
You've wasted
enough of my time.

561
01:06:31,004 --> 01:06:33,132
I have my father's affairs
to attend to.

562
01:06:35,801 --> 01:06:37,177
Get out and find her!

563
01:06:42,975 --> 01:06:46,145
Tell me you have more promising
news from your contacts.

564
01:06:46,937 --> 01:06:48,897
They open the will
in three days.

565
01:06:49,398 --> 01:06:51,150
We are running
out of time.

566
01:06:52,484 --> 01:06:54,653
Soon, I hope.

567
01:06:55,279 --> 01:06:56,989
I'm sending men
to the South.

568
01:06:57,156 --> 01:06:59,158
That's where
we found the bodies.

569
01:07:10,169 --> 01:07:11,962
<i>If the Yakuza got
into the funeral...</i>

570
01:07:12,254 --> 01:07:13,589
<i>they had someone inside.</i>

571
01:07:13,922 --> 01:07:16,258
They'll never find me here.

572
01:07:17,759 --> 01:07:19,094
You're not safe.

573
01:07:20,512 --> 01:07:22,014
I'm coming down there.

574
01:07:22,514 --> 01:07:23,640
They'll follow you.

575
01:07:25,350 --> 01:07:27,853
Please.
Wait a few days.

576
01:07:28,187 --> 01:07:29,396
Please. I'm fine.

577
01:07:29,855 --> 01:07:31,273
Logan's here.

578
01:07:31,523 --> 01:07:33,525
He's wounded, Mariko.

579
01:07:35,277 --> 01:07:36,403
Someone's here.

580
01:07:36,487 --> 01:07:37,196
Mariko?

581
01:07:37,279 --> 01:07:38,271
- I got to go.
<i>- Hallo?</i>

582
01:07:38,322 --> 01:07:39,490
Mariko?

583
01:07:42,784 --> 01:07:45,496
A tree fell on the road.

584
01:07:45,871 --> 01:07:48,707
The men could use some help.

585
01:08:20,989 --> 01:08:22,616
Are you okay?

586
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:27,371
Tired.

587
01:08:27,955 --> 01:08:29,623
Do you need something?

588
01:08:31,833 --> 01:08:32,834
No.

589
01:08:41,927 --> 01:08:43,053
This will help.

590
01:09:34,688 --> 01:09:36,356
It's time.

591
01:09:39,234 --> 01:09:40,235
What?

592
01:09:41,278 --> 01:09:43,989
Please. Take it.

593
01:09:45,490 --> 01:09:47,034
Thank you.

594
01:10:05,385 --> 01:10:06,720
No.

595
01:10:08,347 --> 01:10:09,890
Two hands.

596
01:10:10,390 --> 01:10:14,186
Japanese sword
require two hands.

597
01:10:18,982 --> 01:10:21,151
- Like that?
- That's it.

598
01:10:23,779 --> 01:10:25,739
It's beautiful, Yashida.

599
01:10:28,659 --> 01:10:29,868
But I can't take it.

600
01:10:30,369 --> 01:10:31,662
Please.

601
01:10:32,746 --> 01:10:34,039
Thank you.

602
01:10:40,462 --> 01:10:41,630
Keep it safe.

603
01:10:44,549 --> 01:10:46,426
Keep it safe for me.

604
01:10:49,012 --> 01:10:51,598
Someday,
I'll come get it.

605
01:10:59,272 --> 01:11:01,108
It's time.

606
01:11:47,821 --> 01:11:51,450
I was here
when it happened.

607
01:11:53,952 --> 01:11:56,329
It's how I met
your grandfather.

608
01:11:56,705 --> 01:11:58,790
We hid in there.

609
01:12:00,375 --> 01:12:01,835
I heard the stories.

610
01:12:06,506 --> 01:12:08,133
My grandfather would say...

611
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:11,470
"what happened here was proof that
everything in the world finds peace".

612
01:12:16,183 --> 01:12:18,185
Eventually.

613
01:12:22,522 --> 01:12:24,983
That man can
recover from anything.

614
01:12:29,070 --> 01:12:31,573
Maybe you, too.

615
01:12:37,496 --> 01:12:39,664
You don't sleep very well.

616
01:12:39,831 --> 01:12:41,833
You call out in the night.

617
01:12:48,423 --> 01:12:49,716
Who's Jean?

618
01:13:04,731 --> 01:13:07,442
We should go back.
There's rain coming.

619
01:13:28,213 --> 01:13:29,756
I'll make tea.

620
01:13:37,889 --> 01:13:39,224
For you.

621
01:14:15,176 --> 01:14:16,678
This isn't right.

622
01:14:30,317 --> 01:14:33,570
You need this tied
like a proper samurai.

623
01:14:37,574 --> 01:14:39,743
Your grandfather
called me a ronin.

624
01:14:41,161 --> 01:14:43,496
A samurai
without a master.

625
01:14:45,373 --> 01:14:48,543
He said I was destined
to live forever...

626
01:14:49,669 --> 01:14:52,088
with no reason to live.

627
01:14:57,052 --> 01:14:58,595
Was he right?

628
01:14:59,846 --> 01:15:01,181
Yes.

629
01:15:06,353 --> 01:15:08,063
Still?

630
01:15:57,278 --> 01:15:58,279
Hey.

631
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:00,824
What are you doing?

632
01:16:05,412 --> 01:16:07,914
This isn't going
to end well.

633
01:16:12,293 --> 01:16:14,295
Everyone you love dies.

634
01:16:34,983 --> 01:16:36,985
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

635
01:16:39,112 --> 01:16:40,780
Do you know
what that means?

636
01:16:45,452 --> 01:16:47,287
An animal.

637
01:16:47,454 --> 01:16:52,709
A fierce creature with long
claws and sharp teeth.

638
01:16:54,794 --> 01:16:56,838
It fears nothing.

639
01:16:58,631 --> 01:17:02,677
When I was a girl,
I had nightmares.

640
01:17:03,344 --> 01:17:05,722
I'd wake up and
run to my parents.

641
01:17:06,681 --> 01:17:09,392
My father
would get angry.

642
01:17:13,813 --> 01:17:16,900
"Go back to sleep.
Face your fears."

643
01:17:18,359 --> 01:17:20,862
My grandfather
was different.

644
01:17:21,821 --> 01:17:25,575
He told me stories
about <i>Kuzuri,</i> his friend.

645
01:17:26,493 --> 01:17:29,537
Who he met at the bottom
of a well.

646
01:17:31,664 --> 01:17:36,169
He said the <i>Kuzuri</i> was
magical and saved his life.

647
01:17:38,505 --> 01:17:43,843
He said <i>Kuzuri</i> would
protect me, too, as I slept in my bed.

648
01:17:53,061 --> 01:17:54,604
Who's Jean?

649
01:18:02,278 --> 01:18:03,780
Is she like you?

650
01:18:06,533 --> 01:18:08,535
What happened to her?

651
01:18:09,869 --> 01:18:11,746
She died.

652
01:18:18,461 --> 01:18:20,213
I killed her.

653
01:18:26,886 --> 01:18:28,805
Along with the Kuzuri.

654
01:19:10,263 --> 01:19:11,514
Logan.

655
01:19:25,862 --> 01:19:27,780
Mariko?

656
01:19:30,199 --> 01:19:31,117
Logan!

657
01:19:31,993 --> 01:19:33,286
Logan!

658
01:19:34,871 --> 01:19:35,955
Mariko?

659
01:19:36,623 --> 01:19:37,832
Mariko!

660
01:19:38,625 --> 01:19:40,543
No! Logan!

661
01:19:46,299 --> 01:19:47,467
No!

662
01:19:48,551 --> 01:19:49,385
Logan!

663
01:19:50,011 --> 01:19:51,054
No!

664
01:20:03,149 --> 01:20:03,900
Mariko!

665
01:20:07,695 --> 01:20:08,696
Logan!

666
01:20:10,323 --> 01:20:11,491
No!

667
01:20:13,826 --> 01:20:14,827
Logan!

668
01:20:15,912 --> 01:20:17,664
Mariko! Mariko!

669
01:20:17,830 --> 01:20:19,332
Logan!

670
01:20:39,769 --> 01:20:41,020
Where are they
taking her?

671
01:20:41,229 --> 01:20:42,897
Where are they
taking her?

672
01:20:43,064 --> 01:20:44,524
Where, you piece of shit?

673
01:20:46,442 --> 01:20:49,028
I no talk, <i>gaijin.</i>

674
01:20:49,696 --> 01:20:51,572
I never talk.

675
01:20:58,037 --> 01:21:00,206
Who hired you?

676
01:21:11,217 --> 01:21:13,094
Uh-oh.

677
01:21:23,396 --> 01:21:25,064
Take me to Noburo.

678
01:21:25,898 --> 01:21:27,734
- Logan.
- Take me to him.

679
01:21:28,651 --> 01:21:29,902
I need to tell you
something.

680
01:21:30,069 --> 01:21:31,988
Do it. Now.

681
01:21:51,257 --> 01:21:53,176
You wait in the car.

682
01:21:53,676 --> 01:21:55,678
- Logan.
- What?

683
01:21:56,512 --> 01:21:58,431
I saw you die.

684
01:21:58,598 --> 01:22:00,099
What?

685
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:02,351
I saw you die.

686
01:22:02,769 --> 01:22:04,771
When? Just now?

687
01:22:05,229 --> 01:22:06,939
A while ago.

688
01:22:07,106 --> 01:22:09,984
But it's not like
I get a complete picture.

689
01:22:10,151 --> 01:22:12,403
More like looking
through a keyhole.

690
01:22:13,988 --> 01:22:16,240
But I'm always right.

691
01:22:17,116 --> 01:22:20,453
All I can see is one part
of a person's life...

692
01:22:21,079 --> 01:22:22,622
their death.

693
01:22:23,331 --> 01:22:25,583
And I saw yours.

694
01:22:28,753 --> 01:22:30,671
So, what did you see?

695
01:22:31,130 --> 01:22:35,468
I see you on your back.
There's blood everywhere.

696
01:22:37,470 --> 01:22:40,515
You're holding your own
heart in your hand.

697
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:44,602
It's not beating.

698
01:22:45,436 --> 01:22:46,646
I don't have time
for this shit.

699
01:22:47,021 --> 01:22:50,858
When I was five, I knew how
my own parents would die.

700
01:22:53,194 --> 01:22:56,697
Then I watched it happen
from the back seat.

701
01:22:59,659 --> 01:23:00,827
Look at me.

702
01:23:03,955 --> 01:23:06,666
A lot of people have tried to
kill me, and I'm still here.

703
01:23:07,125 --> 01:23:08,793
Yeah...

704
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:11,462
but you're different now,
aren't you?

705
01:23:12,213 --> 01:23:14,132
They can hurt you.

706
01:23:14,298 --> 01:23:16,300
They can kill you.

707
01:23:16,467 --> 01:23:18,469
Just wait in the car.

708
01:23:29,313 --> 01:23:31,315
- I said, wait in the car.
- You need backup.

709
01:23:31,482 --> 01:23:33,359
You're not safe,
not in your condition.

710
01:23:35,361 --> 01:23:37,697
Just think of me
as your bodyguard.

711
01:23:46,706 --> 01:23:48,499
<i>Sexy.</i>

712
01:23:55,548 --> 01:23:57,508
- Come on!
- I'm coming.

713
01:24:05,975 --> 01:24:09,020
Okay, round four.
Here we go.

714
01:24:22,158 --> 01:24:23,576
Drink for you, my lady.

715
01:24:31,584 --> 01:24:32,668
Get out.

716
01:24:38,257 --> 01:24:40,009
Not you.

717
01:24:41,928 --> 01:24:43,095
Now call me old-fashioned...

718
01:24:43,262 --> 01:24:44,805
but I thought
being engaged meant

719
01:24:44,889 --> 01:24:46,098
you were done with
this kind of bullshit.

720
01:24:46,265 --> 01:24:47,642
I am the Minister of Justice.

721
01:24:47,725 --> 01:24:49,018
Do you have any idea
what I could do to you?

722
01:24:49,185 --> 01:24:51,062
Really? You're gonna
try and talk tough,

723
01:24:51,145 --> 01:24:52,939
standing there in
your red underwear?

724
01:24:53,439 --> 01:24:54,523
You have ten words...

725
01:24:54,774 --> 01:24:57,068
ten words...

726
01:24:57,193 --> 01:25:01,572
to explain to me why you,
the Minister of Justice...

727
01:25:01,739 --> 01:25:04,575
would want your fiancé
killed by the Yakuza.

728
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:06,244
And if I don't like
what you say,

729
01:25:06,327 --> 01:25:08,955
you are going through
that fucking window.

730
01:25:09,830 --> 01:25:11,916
You don't have the faintest
idea what's going on...

731
01:25:14,710 --> 01:25:16,671
- How many words was that?
- Nine.

732
01:25:16,837 --> 01:25:19,465
Nine.
You have one word left.

733
01:25:22,468 --> 01:25:23,135
Really?

734
01:25:23,427 --> 01:25:24,887
Really?

735
01:25:25,221 --> 01:25:26,722
Shingen. Shingen!

736
01:25:28,724 --> 01:25:29,892
Keep going.

737
01:25:32,061 --> 01:25:33,396
Since he got sick...

738
01:25:33,562 --> 01:25:37,066
old man Yashida spent billions
on doctors, healers.

739
01:25:37,233 --> 01:25:39,986
Stockpiling adamantium
at his lab in the North...

740
01:25:40,152 --> 01:25:42,530
secretly trying
to prolong his life.

741
01:25:42,697 --> 01:25:45,825
He brought the company
to the edge of bankruptcy.

742
01:25:45,992 --> 01:25:48,160
He was obsessed
with you.

743
01:25:50,746 --> 01:25:52,039
English!

744
01:25:52,581 --> 01:25:55,584
Shingen lied,
protected the old man...

745
01:25:55,751 --> 01:25:58,921
concealed the debt from
stockholders and the board.

746
01:25:59,088 --> 01:26:01,507
He tried to be a good son
and thought he'd be rewarded.

747
01:26:02,591 --> 01:26:04,719
And then the old man left
everything to his granddaughter.

748
01:26:04,885 --> 01:26:07,430
If Mariko got all that power,
she would dump his ass.

749
01:26:07,596 --> 01:26:08,556
It's true.

750
01:26:08,723 --> 01:26:11,767
Mariko would have never gone
through with the wedding...

751
01:26:11,934 --> 01:26:14,437
not once the will
was revealed.

752
01:26:15,229 --> 01:26:16,355
She never took to me.

753
01:26:16,772 --> 01:26:19,608
Oh, really?
A class act like you.

754
01:26:20,276 --> 01:26:22,945
Shingen promised me
a fortune for my help.

755
01:26:24,113 --> 01:26:27,700
So, you put a hit on his daughter.
Is that it?

756
01:26:28,784 --> 01:26:30,786
Political careers
don't last forever.

757
01:26:31,579 --> 01:26:32,455
That's right.

758
01:26:32,788 --> 01:26:34,623
Wait! Wait! No!

759
01:26:34,790 --> 01:26:37,543
You wanted the truth.
I told you the truth!

760
01:26:38,461 --> 01:26:40,254
I didn't like it.

761
01:26:40,921 --> 01:26:42,256
Wow.

762
01:26:44,133 --> 01:26:45,551
How did you know there's
a pool down there?

763
01:26:45,718 --> 01:26:47,094
I didn't.

764
01:27:03,402 --> 01:27:07,782
Did you know I studied
biology in college?

765
01:27:09,658 --> 01:27:11,118
Genetics.

766
01:27:15,122 --> 01:27:17,583
There are genes
that skip generations.

767
01:27:18,084 --> 01:27:19,877
Recessive genes.

768
01:27:22,713 --> 01:27:23,464
Eyes.

769
01:27:23,464 --> 01:27:24,590
Hair.

770
01:27:25,966 --> 01:27:27,259
Talent.

771
01:27:28,677 --> 01:27:30,137
Temperament.

772
01:27:32,223 --> 01:27:35,518
Not every child
gets the same.

773
01:27:36,268 --> 01:27:38,437
My father saw
little of himself in me.

774
01:27:39,563 --> 01:27:41,107
But in you...

775
01:27:41,482 --> 01:27:43,859
he faced a mirror.

776
01:28:03,379 --> 01:28:04,922
How did you
convince my father...

777
01:28:05,089 --> 01:28:06,590
to award you control...

778
01:28:06,715 --> 01:28:08,217
of Asia's largest
corporation?

779
01:28:08,634 --> 01:28:10,136
You've gone insane.

780
01:28:11,637 --> 01:28:13,431
I'm just waking up.

781
01:28:15,182 --> 01:28:16,725
If you kill me,
you will lose...

782
01:28:16,976 --> 01:28:18,853
what little
honor you have left.

783
01:28:22,606 --> 01:28:23,774
Fear not Marko.

784
01:28:24,066 --> 01:28:26,402
I don't want to hurt you.

785
01:28:26,777 --> 01:28:27,903
I want to help you.

786
01:28:28,154 --> 01:28:29,780
Help you end your pain...

787
01:28:30,030 --> 01:28:31,240
what that
mutant stopped you...

788
01:28:31,449 --> 01:28:32,741
from doing last week.

789
01:28:32,950 --> 01:28:35,161
I never wanted
to die, Father.

790
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:53,971
It's alright, Mariko.

791
01:28:59,185 --> 01:28:59,935
Come with me.

792
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:00,936
What is happening?!

793
01:29:01,228 --> 01:29:03,439
More than
you can imagine.

794
01:29:11,614 --> 01:29:13,365
You.

795
01:29:13,782 --> 01:29:15,242
Me.

796
01:29:15,409 --> 01:29:19,121
Sorry to interrupt, but I need
your daughter alive.

797
01:29:19,288 --> 01:29:20,623
What are you?

798
01:29:21,457 --> 01:29:23,876
A chemist, a nihilist...

799
01:29:24,293 --> 01:29:27,755
a capitalist,
a mutation.

800
01:29:31,342 --> 01:29:32,843
A viper.

801
01:30:03,082 --> 01:30:04,917
Where is the security?

802
01:30:24,937 --> 01:30:25,938
Yakuza.

803
01:30:28,565 --> 01:30:29,566
Shingen?

804
01:30:50,170 --> 01:30:51,463
Logan.

805
01:31:02,099 --> 01:31:03,642
This. This here.

806
01:31:03,809 --> 01:31:05,436
Where is this?

807
01:31:08,689 --> 01:31:10,649
Master Yashida's birthplace.

808
01:31:11,692 --> 01:31:14,486
The company built a facility
into the mountainside.

809
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:19,491
How far?

810
01:31:20,159 --> 01:31:22,745
500 kilometers from here.

811
01:32:29,645 --> 01:32:31,980
I gotta get that
thing out of me.

812
01:32:32,481 --> 01:32:33,440
How?

813
01:32:33,816 --> 01:32:34,983
No, stop, Logan.

814
01:32:35,150 --> 01:32:38,153
I saw you die.
I'm never wrong.

815
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:40,322
- I'm never wrong.
- You're not always right.

816
01:32:40,489 --> 01:32:41,698
You didn't know the old man
was gonna bite it.

817
01:32:41,865 --> 01:32:43,784
I saw you die in a room like this
with your heart in your hand.

818
01:32:43,951 --> 01:32:45,828
I can't leave her with
those freaks and killers.

819
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:49,373
I'm the only chance she's got,
but not with that thing inside me.

820
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:50,624
You're going to die, Logan.

821
01:32:50,707 --> 01:32:52,209
Maybe that's okay.

822
01:32:52,668 --> 01:32:54,503
No, listen to me, Logan!

823
01:32:54,670 --> 01:32:56,672
No, stop. Logan!

824
01:32:57,798 --> 01:32:59,174
You're not gonna want
to watch this part.

825
01:32:59,341 --> 01:33:01,844
No! Listen to me!
Please, no!

826
01:33:02,511 --> 01:33:05,055
No, stop.
Listen to me.

827
01:33:06,306 --> 01:33:07,349
Logan!

828
01:33:16,150 --> 01:33:17,192
Move!

829
01:33:17,359 --> 01:33:18,861
Stay away from him.

830
01:33:20,237 --> 01:33:22,030
He killed your master.

831
01:33:22,698 --> 01:33:25,409
Put hands on your sister.

832
01:33:25,701 --> 01:33:27,536
And now you want him?

833
01:33:30,289 --> 01:33:32,124
Oh, no.
I can't see.

834
01:33:33,041 --> 01:33:34,960
You'll always be a beggar.

835
01:33:35,127 --> 01:33:36,044
You're crazy.

836
01:33:44,386 --> 01:33:45,429
Oh, no.

837
01:34:16,627 --> 01:34:17,920
Yukio.

838
01:34:37,439 --> 01:34:38,482
Logan!

839
01:34:45,614 --> 01:34:47,783
Logan! Logan!

840
01:34:48,659 --> 01:34:49,785
Logan!

841
01:35:32,119 --> 01:35:34,121
Don't hit my friends.

842
01:35:37,207 --> 01:35:38,292
Where's Mariko?

843
01:35:38,458 --> 01:35:41,295
She's gone.
That Viper bitch took her.

844
01:35:41,461 --> 01:35:43,797
It was my father's
obsession...

845
01:35:44,506 --> 01:35:47,301
with mutation,
with God's mistakes...

846
01:35:48,802 --> 01:35:52,973
like you and her,
that ruined this house.

847
01:37:05,962 --> 01:37:07,631
You tried to kill
your daughter.

848
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:11,760
Live with that.

849
01:37:26,942 --> 01:37:29,736
What kind
of monster are you?

850
01:37:30,612 --> 01:37:32,197
The Wolverine.

851
01:37:45,502 --> 01:37:48,547
Hey, come here,
come here. That's it.

852
01:37:49,214 --> 01:37:50,215
I was wrong.

853
01:37:50,841 --> 01:37:52,259
I told you.

854
01:37:52,426 --> 01:37:54,177
Let me have a look at you.

855
01:37:55,053 --> 01:37:56,513
It's nothing.

856
01:37:56,680 --> 01:37:59,349
Hey, thank you.

857
01:38:11,570 --> 01:38:13,864
It's a trap, Logan.

858
01:38:33,508 --> 01:38:35,177
Why have you brought me here?

859
01:38:35,719 --> 01:38:37,053
What are you hiding?

860
01:38:37,387 --> 01:38:38,930
You will soon find out.

861
01:38:41,057 --> 01:38:43,185
Welcome, Mariko.

862
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:47,522
It's all right, Mariko. She also
serves the House of Yashida.

863
01:38:47,689 --> 01:38:49,107
She serves herself.

864
01:38:49,274 --> 01:38:51,526
She infected Logan.

865
01:38:51,860 --> 01:38:53,028
Hmm...

866
01:38:53,278 --> 01:38:54,404
And what about Grandfather?

867
01:38:55,363 --> 01:38:57,032
What did you infect him with?

868
01:38:59,868 --> 01:39:02,204
I granted
his dying wish.

869
01:39:02,871 --> 01:39:04,956
I helped him rest.

870
01:39:07,042 --> 01:39:09,377
Now, it's your turn.

871
01:39:43,203 --> 01:39:45,997
Listen to me, mutant.
She will not be harmed.

872
01:39:47,457 --> 01:39:49,042
She will be fine.

873
01:39:50,168 --> 01:39:52,337
So long as you do your job.

874
01:39:53,296 --> 01:39:56,174
Logan will be here soon,
you should prepare.

875
01:39:56,716 --> 01:39:58,969
It was easy
to lure him here.

876
01:39:59,344 --> 01:40:00,804
It's another thing
to capture him.

877
01:40:00,887 --> 01:40:03,974
We're ready.
He's never faced the Black Clan.

878
01:40:06,685 --> 01:40:07,894
Yes, well...

879
01:40:09,896 --> 01:40:12,065
Dip your arrows in this.

880
01:40:12,774 --> 01:40:14,484
It won't kill him,

881
01:40:15,151 --> 01:40:17,070
but it will slow him down.

882
01:40:17,153 --> 01:40:18,280
Keep your potions.

883
01:40:18,613 --> 01:40:21,032
He's no challenge for us now.
He's weak.

884
01:40:21,908 --> 01:40:22,993
Okay.

885
01:40:26,288 --> 01:40:28,039
But when you fail...

886
01:40:29,499 --> 01:40:30,917
you have this.

887
01:40:48,476 --> 01:40:50,395
Did you have a nice rest?

888
01:40:57,610 --> 01:40:58,862
I don't know
what you said or did

889
01:40:58,945 --> 01:41:00,280
to deceive Harada
or my grandfather...

890
01:41:00,447 --> 01:41:01,865
Now, now, calm down.

891
01:41:02,032 --> 01:41:04,034
Your grandfather
sought me out.

892
01:41:04,451 --> 01:41:06,202
I am the head
of this family now.

893
01:41:10,498 --> 01:41:13,043
And why do you
suppose that is?

894
01:41:14,878 --> 01:41:17,839
Why do you think
the old man chose you?

895
01:41:21,134 --> 01:41:22,844
Because you are strong?

896
01:41:23,803 --> 01:41:25,889
Or because you are weak?

897
01:42:21,069 --> 01:42:22,737
I see you've come to fight.

898
01:42:22,904 --> 01:42:24,072
It's pointless.

899
01:42:24,239 --> 01:42:26,574
You're weak.
You're out numbered.

900
01:42:26,741 --> 01:42:30,745
The Black Clan has protected the
House of Yashida for 700 years.

901
01:42:32,205 --> 01:42:33,832
Is that all the men
you brought?

902
01:42:37,168 --> 01:42:38,753
I'm gonna get her.

903
01:42:39,379 --> 01:42:41,381
We are grateful for your
protection of Mariko.

904
01:42:41,548 --> 01:42:44,676
But there is one more sacrifice
you must make for her family.

905
01:42:45,927 --> 01:42:48,096
Go fuck yourself,
pretty boy.

906
01:45:50,111 --> 01:45:51,112
Yukio, run!

907
01:47:03,267 --> 01:47:04,560
Logan.

908
01:48:36,944 --> 01:48:38,362
<i>Logan.</i>

909
01:48:38,488 --> 01:48:39,530
<i>Kayla.</i>

910
01:48:39,655 --> 01:48:40,823
<i>- I love you.
- Kayla!</i>

911
01:48:40,948 --> 01:48:42,283
<i>Logan.</i>

912
01:48:47,246 --> 01:48:48,706
<i>- Logan!
- Mariko!</i>

913
01:48:50,666 --> 01:48:51,667
Jean.

914
01:48:52,710 --> 01:48:54,086
<i>Save me.</i>

915
01:49:25,326 --> 01:49:27,286
Stand back.
There is no need.

916
01:49:27,537 --> 01:49:29,413
Where is she?
Where's Mariko?

917
01:49:29,539 --> 01:49:30,540
Where is she?

918
01:49:31,457 --> 01:49:33,626
"Where is Mariko?"

919
01:49:33,793 --> 01:49:36,045
Still pining away?

920
01:49:36,212 --> 01:49:38,047
That's so sweet.

921
01:49:39,173 --> 01:49:41,092
Impressive, no?

922
01:49:41,342 --> 01:49:44,929
He is made of adamantium,
just like you.

923
01:49:55,606 --> 01:49:59,318
Oh, Logan, you know what, I get it.
You're frustrated.

924
01:49:59,485 --> 01:50:01,571
I know she's here.
I want to see her.

925
01:50:02,613 --> 01:50:03,906
You want answers.

926
01:50:04,949 --> 01:50:06,158
Yes, I want answers!

927
01:50:06,325 --> 01:50:08,160
I'm sorry,
I wish I could say more,

928
01:50:08,244 --> 01:50:10,121
but I was hired in
part for my discretion.

929
01:50:10,288 --> 01:50:11,163
I'm sure you were.

930
01:50:12,331 --> 01:50:13,499
That...

931
01:50:13,666 --> 01:50:18,421
and a certain talent for combining
biochemistry and metaphysics.

932
01:50:18,963 --> 01:50:21,841
High-grade toxins
are my specialty.

933
01:50:22,341 --> 01:50:24,552
It helps to be
genetically immune

934
01:50:24,635 --> 01:50:27,013
to every poison
known to man, as I am.

935
01:50:28,014 --> 01:50:31,976
And immune to the toxin
that is man himself...

936
01:50:33,144 --> 01:50:34,478
as I am.

937
01:50:34,979 --> 01:50:37,315
I'll tell you what,
you twisted mutant bitch...

938
01:50:38,190 --> 01:50:39,775
why don't you
open these bracelets

939
01:50:39,859 --> 01:50:41,777
and we'll see
who's made of what?

940
01:50:46,365 --> 01:50:48,993
The claws.
Now we can begin.

941
01:50:51,662 --> 01:50:53,956
I know you care for him.

942
01:50:54,415 --> 01:50:55,916
You need to let go of that.

943
01:50:56,208 --> 01:50:58,252
You are a Yashida.

944
01:50:58,461 --> 01:51:00,421
She betrayed
my grandfather...

945
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:02,173
and so have you.

946
01:51:02,840 --> 01:51:03,591
No Mariko.

947
01:51:03,966 --> 01:51:05,801
We grew up together.

948
01:51:06,093 --> 01:51:07,511
You need to trust me.

949
01:51:08,638 --> 01:51:10,473
Let me go to him!

950
01:51:10,640 --> 01:51:13,100
He saved my life!

951
01:51:13,309 --> 01:51:15,645
Let him go, Mariko!

952
01:51:16,020 --> 01:51:17,104
This isn't easy
for me but...

953
01:51:17,438 --> 01:51:20,316
I'm following
Grandfather's wishes.

954
01:51:20,399 --> 01:51:23,861
The suppressant bug you found
inside of you was mine.

955
01:51:24,236 --> 01:51:26,781
You took it out
on your own.

956
01:51:27,782 --> 01:51:29,784
I didn't see that coming.

957
01:51:30,159 --> 01:51:31,619
The Viper woman is evil...

958
01:51:31,786 --> 01:51:33,579
we both know that.

959
01:51:33,746 --> 01:51:36,540
But she's a means
to an end...

960
01:51:36,957 --> 01:51:37,875
Where is she?

961
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:39,669
An end your
grandfather wanted.

962
01:51:39,752 --> 01:51:40,878
You are strong.

963
01:51:41,253 --> 01:51:42,922
You have courage.

964
01:51:43,631 --> 01:51:44,965
Real courage.

965
01:51:48,636 --> 01:51:51,430
But that won't
help much now.

966
01:52:04,777 --> 01:52:05,903
What the...?

967
01:52:06,779 --> 01:52:08,364
You need to trust me.

968
01:52:08,989 --> 01:52:10,282
Is that hard?

969
01:52:10,991 --> 01:52:13,619
We were meant
to be together.

970
01:52:14,120 --> 01:52:16,122
We still can be.

971
01:52:17,123 --> 01:52:18,499
Perhaps.

972
01:52:47,403 --> 01:52:48,195
Stop!

973
01:52:54,493 --> 01:52:55,661
This is madness.

974
01:53:01,333 --> 01:53:02,418
Let's go.

975
01:53:05,337 --> 01:53:06,338
Go!

976
01:53:07,423 --> 01:53:08,424
Run!

977
01:53:21,854 --> 01:53:23,355
Come on.

978
01:53:39,038 --> 01:53:40,414
Mariko, come!
Go! Run!

979
01:53:59,725 --> 01:54:01,143
Mariko, get out!

980
01:55:12,214 --> 01:55:13,591
Ahhh!

981
01:56:50,062 --> 01:56:51,188
Come on.

982
01:56:52,022 --> 01:56:53,232
This is not the way.

983
01:57:06,704 --> 01:57:08,247
Two hands.

984
01:57:12,710 --> 01:57:13,836
Master...

985
01:57:22,094 --> 01:57:24,221
Hey! Bub!

986
01:57:43,949 --> 01:57:44,742
Harada.

987
01:57:51,415 --> 01:57:52,958
I'm sorry.

988
01:58:43,342 --> 01:58:44,384
Now, you die.

989
01:58:45,177 --> 01:58:46,553
Today is not my day.

990
01:59:31,849 --> 01:59:33,183
Hey!

991
01:59:40,399 --> 01:59:42,025
Logan-san.

992
01:59:42,192 --> 01:59:44,236
Don't look so shocked.

993
01:59:46,613 --> 01:59:50,450
With you at my side,
I survived Nagasaki.

994
01:59:50,617 --> 01:59:53,245
Surely,
I could survive this.

995
01:59:54,913 --> 01:59:57,749
It's all right.
It won't take long.

996
01:59:58,292 --> 02:00:01,295
Dr. Green and I have been waiting.

997
02:00:01,587 --> 02:00:05,132
It's only this armor
that's kept me alive.

998
02:00:05,299 --> 02:00:10,220
We built it to make me strong, so I
can take what you would not give.

999
02:00:10,387 --> 02:00:13,599
And transfer your
unwanted healing...

1000
02:00:14,474 --> 02:00:16,643
to my body.

1001
02:00:18,937 --> 02:00:22,232
My legacy must
be preserved.

1002
02:00:22,900 --> 02:00:26,486
Your mistake was to believe
that a life without end...

1003
02:00:26,653 --> 02:00:27,946
can have no meaning.

1004
02:00:30,949 --> 02:00:33,744
It is the only life that can.

1005
02:00:35,120 --> 02:00:36,622
Hold on.

1006
02:00:36,788 --> 02:00:38,624
We are almost there.

1007
02:00:38,790 --> 02:00:42,794
The peace,
the peace you've wanted.

1008
02:00:43,253 --> 02:00:45,422
Your reward.

1009
02:00:46,089 --> 02:00:49,259
You know, I'm giving
you the very death...

1010
02:00:49,801 --> 02:00:51,970
you longed for.

1011
02:01:04,775 --> 02:01:05,817
This feeling...

1012
02:01:06,985 --> 02:01:09,488
to be invincible...

1013
02:01:12,115 --> 02:01:13,825
like you.

1014
02:01:26,630 --> 02:01:28,840
You are a monster.

1015
02:01:29,257 --> 02:01:30,425
Mariko.

1016
02:01:31,176 --> 02:01:33,679
It's me.
Your grandfather.

1017
02:01:35,514 --> 02:01:37,099
I buried my grandfather.

1018
02:02:40,245 --> 02:02:42,914
You asked me to
come say goodbye.

1019
02:02:43,540 --> 02:02:45,250
Sayonara.

1020
02:03:07,606 --> 02:03:09,441
Are you all right?

1021
02:03:18,784 --> 02:03:19,785
Logan.

1022
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:31,797
Logan.

1023
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:35,967
Logan.

1024
02:03:48,146 --> 02:03:49,564
You're here.

1025
02:03:51,817 --> 02:03:53,485
Of course.

1026
02:03:55,153 --> 02:03:57,114
Can you stay?

1027
02:03:59,282 --> 02:04:01,284
I can't.

1028
02:04:03,662 --> 02:04:05,330
Yes, you can.

1029
02:04:07,124 --> 02:04:09,334
This is what you wanted.

1030
02:04:11,461 --> 02:04:12,838
Not anymore.

1031
02:04:17,759 --> 02:04:20,345
I'm all alone here.

1032
02:04:24,599 --> 02:04:26,685
You put me here.

1033
02:04:28,562 --> 02:04:31,022
You were hurting
people, Jean.

1034
02:04:32,274 --> 02:04:33,733
I had to.

1035
02:04:42,242 --> 02:04:44,411
I love you, Jean.

1036
02:04:49,958 --> 02:04:51,793
I always will.

1037
02:05:28,455 --> 02:05:31,333
You are my only family.

1038
02:05:32,918 --> 02:05:35,253
Be well, sister.

1039
02:05:48,683 --> 02:05:51,895
Am I wrong to think
you might visit me soon?

1040
02:06:03,448 --> 02:06:04,741
Stay.

1041
02:06:06,409 --> 02:06:07,911
I can't, princess.

1042
02:06:08,828 --> 02:06:10,247
I'm a soldier,

1043
02:06:10,330 --> 02:06:12,082
and I've been
hiding too long.

1044
02:06:25,804 --> 02:06:28,473
<i>In our business
profile tonight, Mariko Yashida.</i></i>

1045
02:06:28,640 --> 02:06:31,434
<i>A two-generation passing of the
torch in the Yashida family...</i>

1046
02:06:31,601 --> 02:06:34,354
<i>as Mariko Yashida takes the
helm from her grandfather,</i>

1047
02:06:34,437 --> 02:06:35,563
<i>who built this tech giant.</i>

1048
02:06:35,730 --> 02:06:37,816
<i>I know it will always be
the purpose</i>

1049
02:06:37,899 --> 02:06:39,985
<i>for a corporation
to make a profit...</i>

1050
02:06:40,151 --> 02:06:44,406
<i>but Yashida Industries believes
we can also work with our community.</i>

1051
02:06:50,745 --> 02:06:52,956
So, have you decided?

1052
02:06:55,667 --> 02:06:56,418
What?

1053
02:06:56,876 --> 02:06:59,129
Mariko says we can
go wherever we want.

1054
02:06:59,296 --> 02:07:01,006
Just say where.

1055
02:07:02,257 --> 02:07:03,591
What are you doing?

1056
02:07:05,719 --> 02:07:07,512
I'm your bodyguard.

1057
02:07:12,100 --> 02:07:13,727
So, where do you
want to go?

1058
02:07:15,979 --> 02:07:17,022
Uh...

1059
02:07:17,564 --> 02:07:19,482
Let's just start with up.

1060
02:07:19,649 --> 02:07:21,318
And then?

1061
02:07:25,322 --> 02:07:27,032
We'll see.

1062
02:07:29,409 --> 02:07:30,702
Interesting.

1063
02:09:22,230 --> 02:09:24,399
<i>With cutting edge technology,</i>

1064
02:09:24,482 --> 02:09:26,443
<i>and the world's
leading minds...</i>

1065
02:09:26,609 --> 02:09:28,194
<i>we are on the frontlines...</i>

1066
02:09:28,361 --> 02:09:31,573

1067
02:09:32,031 --> 02:09:34,117
<i>Trask Industries.</i>

1068
02:09:34,284 --> 02:09:36,578
<i>Solving tomorrow's
problems, today.</i>

1069
02:09:37,495 --> 02:09:38,872
I'll take the pat-down.

1070
02:09:39,038 --> 02:09:40,039
Opt out.

1071
02:09:52,969 --> 02:09:54,137
You can go ahead, sir.

1072
02:09:54,220 --> 02:09:55,346
I'll wait.

1073
02:10:03,938 --> 02:10:05,440
What do you want?

1074
02:10:07,192 --> 02:10:09,694
There are dark forces,
Wolverine.

1075
02:10:11,362 --> 02:10:13,448
Human forces
building a weapon...

1076
02:10:13,615 --> 02:10:17,035
that could bring about
the end of our kind.

1077
02:10:19,871 --> 02:10:22,999
What do I want?
I want your help.

1078
02:10:23,458 --> 02:10:25,043
Why would I trust you?

1079
02:10:26,211 --> 02:10:27,545
You wouldn't.

1080
02:10:52,237 --> 02:10:53,530
Hello, Logan.

1081
02:10:57,867 --> 02:10:59,744
How is this possible?

1082
02:10:59,911 --> 02:11:02,664
As I told you
a long time ago...

1083
02:11:03,915 --> 02:11:06,501
you are not
the only one with gifts.
