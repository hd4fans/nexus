1
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,707
Shit, it's spread too fast.

2
00:02:57,781 --> 00:02:59,343
How much longer?

3
00:03:02,987 --> 00:03:04,652
Four weeks.

4
00:03:04,965 --> 00:03:08,295
But if you are bleeding internally,
you will die soon.

5
00:03:08,296 --> 00:03:09,857
Don't worry!

6
00:03:09,858 --> 00:03:12,357
Just give me pain killers
for 4 weeks.

7
00:03:25,683 --> 00:03:28,286
Looks like
we won't see each other again.

8
00:03:28,806 --> 00:03:30,264
Only in this life, doctor.

9
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:11,178
Ho, the suspect is still inside.

10
00:04:11,179 --> 00:04:12,949
Officer Wong is the control car.

11
00:04:16,385 --> 00:04:17,634
Mr. Wong!

12
00:04:20,862 --> 00:04:22,214
What?

13
00:04:22,215 --> 00:04:24,088
The suspect destroyed
the surveillance camera.

14
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:25,858
We can't see what's going on inside.

15
00:04:25,859 --> 00:04:28,773
We don't even know how many
suspects or hostages are inside.

16
00:04:28,774 --> 00:04:30,439
Have we talked to him?

17
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,313
20 minutes ago.

18
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:33,562
You go?

19
00:04:33,563 --> 00:04:35,436
You must have told him that
you are Chief lnspector Wong.

20
00:04:35,437 --> 00:04:38,665
Tell them to surrender in 3 minutes,
alright?

21
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:41,267
Listen!

22
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,743
Hey, l am Chief lnspector Wong.

23
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,306
Are you a negotiator?

24
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,179
Sounds like he is wearing a mask.

25
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,469
l'm in charge of this case.

26
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,551
You are surrounded.

27
00:04:53,552 --> 00:04:56,154
Release the hostages in 3 minutes.

28
00:04:56,155 --> 00:04:58,133
Drop your weapons and surrender.

29
00:04:58,758 --> 00:05:01,257
What you're telling me is going to
get hostages killed.

30
00:05:02,298 --> 00:05:05,733
Tell them your name
and your job position.

31
00:05:06,046 --> 00:05:08,127
Alice Lau, l am a bank teller...

32
00:05:08,128 --> 00:05:10,313
Help!

33
00:05:10,314 --> 00:05:11,667
What do you want?

34
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:13,749
Dismiss the snipers
from the opposite building.

35
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,727
Move all the cops a block back.

36
00:05:15,728 --> 00:05:18,642
And get me a bullet proof Benz
with a full tank of gas.

37
00:05:18,643 --> 00:05:20,516
l want the car in half an hour.

38
00:05:20,517 --> 00:05:22,286
Why don't you just tell them
you want a helicopter?

39
00:05:22,287 --> 00:05:24,993
- Okay! l want a helicopter!
- Shut up! You don't understand.

40
00:05:24,994 --> 00:05:27,387
Stop wasting my time,
l'm not saying anymore.

41
00:05:27,388 --> 00:05:29,886
Half an hour, the clock is ticking.

42
00:05:29,887 --> 00:05:31,761
Hey, l didn't mean that...

43
00:05:35,926 --> 00:05:38,320
l'm not talking to you anymore,
half an hour.

44
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:43,004
Don't try to waste time...
l'm not going to talk to you.

45
00:05:43,005 --> 00:05:45,191
Half an hour, the clock is
starting to tick now.

46
00:05:46,128 --> 00:05:48,314
Forget it, He's crazy!
He said that he wants a helicopter.

47
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:50,396
l feel he's quite calm
and very professional.

48
00:05:50,397 --> 00:05:53,207
Turn on the walkie-talkie, l want to
know what you're talking about.

49
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,770
Remember! Don't say anything.

50
00:05:57,164 --> 00:05:58,518
Go over there!

51
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,154
What?

52
00:06:19,236 --> 00:06:20,797
lt's only a dream.

53
00:06:26,836 --> 00:06:28,709
l am lnspector Ho.

54
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,583
The helicopter can't park out there.

55
00:06:30,584 --> 00:06:32,457
There are too many
neon lights hanging.

56
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,227
l suggest you get a car.

57
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,934
But U want to see if the hostages
are safe or not.

58
00:06:36,935 --> 00:06:38,912
Go back.

59
00:06:38,913 --> 00:06:40,786
lf l don't see a helicopter
in 5 minutes.

60
00:06:40,787 --> 00:06:42,660
l will kill a hostage.

61
00:06:42,661 --> 00:06:44,430
l'm here to help you!

62
00:06:44,431 --> 00:06:47,032
My job is to resolve this case
peacefully.

63
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:49,947
l'm not carrying any weapons.

64
00:06:49,948 --> 00:06:51,198
Go back.

65
00:06:54,425 --> 00:06:56,611
You're already killed someone, Ken!

66
00:06:56,612 --> 00:06:59,734
Why are you using my name?
l told you not to use real names!

67
00:06:59,735 --> 00:07:00,983
lf your chicken asshole brother
didn't drive away.

68
00:07:00,984 --> 00:07:03,586
We would have gotten away.

69
00:07:03,587 --> 00:07:05,148
Stop!

70
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:07,127
Don't cry...

71
00:07:08,376 --> 00:07:11,708
Hey man, why don't we do this...

72
00:07:12,228 --> 00:07:14,413
You let me
take the wounded hostages away.

73
00:07:14,415 --> 00:07:17,745
They are bleeding,
they're in danger of dying.

74
00:07:17,746 --> 00:07:20,348
l promise we will arrange a car
to take you to the helicopter port.

75
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:22,118
No one is allowed to leave.

76
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:23,783
lf anyone dies here.

77
00:07:23,785 --> 00:07:26,179
This will no longer be robbery,
it will become a murder case.

78
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,573
lt's much more serious.

79
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:31,592
The cops will not negotiate with
suspects under those circumstances.

80
00:07:31,593 --> 00:07:33,259
So what if it is a murder case.

81
00:07:33,675 --> 00:07:35,236
Why don't you let them go?

82
00:07:35,237 --> 00:07:36,485
No!

83
00:07:36,486 --> 00:07:37,526
l know you didn't shoot.

84
00:07:37,527 --> 00:07:40,025
You don't look like a person
who would shoot someone.

85
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,170
l will make you a stained witness.

86
00:07:41,171 --> 00:07:42,419
Even if the judge sentences you
for 5 years.

87
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,334
l promise you'll be release
within 3 years.

88
00:07:45,335 --> 00:07:46,792
Don't be an idiot. He's using you.

89
00:07:46,793 --> 00:07:49,707
lf he shoots one more time.
The SDU will storm in here.

90
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,061
No matter
how many hostages there are.

91
00:07:51,062 --> 00:07:52,726
They will not let you live.

92
00:07:52,727 --> 00:07:55,017
Also they can hear everything
we just said.

93
00:07:55,018 --> 00:07:56,370
Time's up.

94
00:07:56,371 --> 00:07:57,515
lf you don't leave now.

95
00:07:57,516 --> 00:07:58,973
lt will be this girl's unlucky day.

96
00:07:58,974 --> 00:08:00,640
You're going to kill her?

97
00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:11,570
Don't do it, Ken.

98
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:12,924
You said my name again?

99
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,798
Ken, if you try to kill the hostages
then l think you'll kill me.

100
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:16,255
You are going to get us killed.

101
00:08:16,256 --> 00:08:17,505
You trust that cop?

102
00:08:17,506 --> 00:08:18,338
- You're scared now, aren't you?
- Ken!

103
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:20,107
No one ever escapes
under a situation like this.

104
00:08:20,109 --> 00:08:21,044
Asshole! Shut up!

105
00:08:21,046 --> 00:08:22,190
Ken you are so selfish!

106
00:08:22,191 --> 00:08:23,335
You want us to die with you.

107
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,626
- Let's see who will die first!
- l dare you to fight me!

108
00:08:31,457 --> 00:08:33,850
Help...

109
00:08:33,851 --> 00:08:36,038
Hostages are coming out.
Repeat, the hostages are coming out.

110
00:08:46,865 --> 00:08:49,259
Officer, l'm a policeman.

111
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,925
l'm on holiday today.

112
00:08:51,862 --> 00:08:53,424
Why is this case so much trouble?

113
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:57,797
You feeling sick today?

114
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:01,441
l'll help this security guard
out first.

115
00:09:02,586 --> 00:09:03,835
Wait!

116
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:13,517
Don't be scared...Hold on!

117
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:16,849
Louder...

118
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:24,137
The person on the phone was you,
right?

119
00:09:25,074 --> 00:09:27,364
You still want to kill me?

120
00:09:28,405 --> 00:09:30,071
But you're too stupid.

121
00:09:31,216 --> 00:09:34,236
How can a dead man talk?

122
00:09:34,548 --> 00:09:37,358
lf you shoot me with you own gun.

123
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:39,649
You can't get away, let's go.

124
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,145
Ho, what's going on?

125
00:09:47,562 --> 00:09:49,331
Why are you turning off
the walkie-talkie?

126
00:09:49,332 --> 00:09:50,997
l almost lost my life.

127
00:09:52,351 --> 00:09:53,287
There are three robbers.

128
00:09:53,288 --> 00:09:54,953
Two suspects were killed by our men.

129
00:09:54,954 --> 00:09:57,036
- That man is the prime suspect.
- What?

130
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,639
What is it?

131
00:10:00,263 --> 00:10:01,929
Suicide!

132
00:10:03,178 --> 00:10:04,844
Write me a report!

133
00:11:10,538 --> 00:11:13,036
Not only the pants,
but the shirt is tight too.

134
00:11:13,037 --> 00:11:14,493
We followed your measurements.

135
00:11:14,494 --> 00:11:17,096
But l've already fixed the buttons
so many times.

136
00:11:17,097 --> 00:11:18,241
Have you ever seen a policeman's...

137
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:19,595
Bottoms fall of when on duty?

138
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,469
lt's really embarrassing.

139
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:24,385
Who? Let me see. Let me measure it.

140
00:11:28,966 --> 00:11:30,422
Okay, the new uniform
will fit for sure.

141
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:31,880
lf not, you can come back and hit me.

142
00:11:31,881 --> 00:11:33,859
- Thanks! Officer!
- lt's okay!

143
00:11:34,275 --> 00:11:36,358
- Waist size, 36 inches.
- Yes, officer!

144
00:11:36,774 --> 00:11:38,855
- Have you checked the tickets?
- Yes, Sir!

145
00:11:38,856 --> 00:11:39,792
Check it again.

146
00:11:39,793 --> 00:11:41,250
Police today are illiterate.

147
00:11:41,251 --> 00:11:43,437
Send this to the Judiciary now.

148
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,705
Come with me to go check
on the warrants.

149
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,370
They're done, how many times
can you check them?

150
00:11:49,372 --> 00:11:52,183
You've arrested everyone
you could possibly arrest.

151
00:11:55,306 --> 00:11:56,554
Clean up the warehouse.
lt's really messy.

152
00:11:56,555 --> 00:11:59,782
- Let's clean it up together.
- Sir...l did it last week.

153
00:11:59,783 --> 00:12:02,280
- Who told you to do this?
- You!

154
00:12:02,281 --> 00:12:04,259
Executive support...

155
00:12:04,676 --> 00:12:08,631
l told you,
sister Cute called in sick.

156
00:12:08,632 --> 00:12:09,776
When she comes back,
l'll tell her to clean up for you.

157
00:12:09,777 --> 00:12:13,316
l'll go...What? Let me do it.

158
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:16,127
There's a draggle taking a dump
on the 4th floor.

159
00:12:16,128 --> 00:12:18,001
No one clean it up!

160
00:12:18,002 --> 00:12:19,355
Piggy, go!

161
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,561
Let's go together.

162
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,787
Have the shoes arrived yet?

163
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,558
They're all in the warehouse.

164
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,744
You want to ask Yun
to go fishing with you?

165
00:13:09,745 --> 00:13:11,827
Yes, he wanted to
go fishing a long time ago.

166
00:13:12,452 --> 00:13:14,638
Really? Let's go together.

167
00:13:15,367 --> 00:13:16,616
Then...

168
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,699
Say it!

169
00:13:19,011 --> 00:13:20,676
Well, Alice...

170
00:13:20,677 --> 00:13:23,592
Dad said he wanted to
take Long fishing.

171
00:13:24,008 --> 00:13:26,714
What about this Sunday?

172
00:13:26,715 --> 00:13:28,381
Long will be happy.

173
00:13:31,088 --> 00:13:32,025
Little girl!

174
00:13:32,754 --> 00:13:34,002
What is it, sir?

175
00:13:34,003 --> 00:13:35,147
Check please.

176
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,189
Someone paid for you already.

177
00:13:37,335 --> 00:13:38,272
Who!

178
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:40,770
l don't know, he left a message.

179
00:13:41,603 --> 00:13:42,540
Where?

180
00:13:42,957 --> 00:13:44,831
He was sitting at the bar,
He's gone now.

181
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:47,328
Was it a man or a woman?

182
00:13:47,329 --> 00:13:48,370
A man!

183
00:14:58,541 --> 00:14:59,895
Sir, can l help you?

184
00:15:00,415 --> 00:15:01,456
l have a meeting with Mr. Lee.

185
00:15:03,226 --> 00:15:04,580
Have you brought
the deed of your house?

186
00:15:07,182 --> 00:15:08,015
Thanks!

187
00:15:09,681 --> 00:15:10,929
This won't take a long time.

188
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,387
lf all the documents are here.

189
00:15:12,388 --> 00:15:13,741
lt'll only take 15 minutes.

190
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:27,066
Sir, are you joking?

191
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:28,213
Are you laughing at me?

192
00:15:33,835 --> 00:15:34,876
Thanks!

193
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,166
You're off work.

194
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:46,953
Run, he has a gun...

195
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:08,087
Go take a break.

196
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,057
Help...

197
00:16:25,682 --> 00:16:27,868
The robber is holding our manager.

198
00:17:10,346 --> 00:17:12,531
According to the staff,
there is only one suspect.

199
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:13,988
He's holding some kind of gun.

200
00:17:13,989 --> 00:17:15,759
They're holding the manager hostage.

201
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,049
Call the SDU.

202
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:18,987
Yes, Sir!

203
00:17:21,485 --> 00:17:22,421
Hey, call the negotiator.

204
00:17:22,422 --> 00:17:23,151
Yes, Sir!

205
00:18:00,943 --> 00:18:02,922
Almost, get up.

206
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:05,837
Sir, please calm down.

207
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,231
l am the negotiator,
l am here to help you.

208
00:18:08,856 --> 00:18:09,792
- l'm coming in now.
- Open the door!

209
00:18:09,793 --> 00:18:11,875
Relax! l'm not armed.

210
00:18:16,352 --> 00:18:19,267
The whole building is surrounded,
you can't get away.

211
00:18:19,579 --> 00:18:20,725
Let him go.

212
00:18:23,015 --> 00:18:24,159
What are you doing here?

213
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,201
Let me hear you demand.

214
00:18:26,242 --> 00:18:27,908
You are here to talk to me?
Open the door!

215
00:18:29,678 --> 00:18:30,614
What's you name?

216
00:18:30,615 --> 00:18:31,552
l'm Hau!

217
00:18:32,385 --> 00:18:34,467
Mr. Hau, l don't like your voice.

218
00:18:35,508 --> 00:18:37,174
Go get me someone else.

219
00:18:38,111 --> 00:18:39,152
Open the door!

220
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,651
Let's go!

221
00:18:49,459 --> 00:18:51,541
You go tell them, tell them to leave.

222
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:53,728
Let's go!
[AMDG]

223
00:18:54,352 --> 00:18:55,810
- Fine!
- Go!

224
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,722
Mr. Wong, did you hear that?
He won't talk to me.

225
00:19:06,325 --> 00:19:08,094
l am Chief lnspector Wong
of the Organized Crime Bureau...

226
00:19:08,095 --> 00:19:09,240
Let's go!

227
00:19:10,385 --> 00:19:12,883
You can talk to me,
l am in charge of this case.

228
00:19:12,884 --> 00:19:14,238
Let's go.

229
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:15,799
lf you want him to stay alive.

230
00:19:16,424 --> 00:19:17,986
Get someone else to come talk to me.

231
00:19:21,005 --> 00:19:21,942
Go up!

232
00:19:36,413 --> 00:19:38,598
The suspected robber has now
brought the hostage to the roof.

233
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,744
All of you go to
the opposite building.

234
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:42,242
l want to know the exact position of
the suspect and the hostage.

235
00:19:42,243 --> 00:19:43,285
Yes Sir!

236
00:19:50,364 --> 00:19:51,612
Sir...

237
00:19:51,613 --> 00:19:53,382
Don't salute me, we belong to
different departments now.

238
00:19:53,383 --> 00:19:55,153
- Go back to your work.
- Yes Sir!

239
00:19:55,465 --> 00:19:57,234
The robber has taken the manager
of the finance company to the roof.

240
00:19:57,235 --> 00:19:58,901
- Where is him?
- Right here.

241
00:20:03,482 --> 00:20:05,251
Sir, the areas has been sealed,
you can't use the lift.

242
00:20:05,252 --> 00:20:06,813
l know, which floor should l go to?

243
00:20:06,814 --> 00:20:07,750
The 28th floor.

244
00:20:07,751 --> 00:20:09,624
lt'll take at least 8 minutes for me
to run up to the roof.

245
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,122
lf anything happens in 8 minutes,
will you take the responsibility?

246
00:20:12,123 --> 00:20:13,684
Sir, l won't take
the responsibilities either.

247
00:20:13,685 --> 00:20:15,141
lf you go, l'll be blamed.

248
00:20:15,142 --> 00:20:16,599
Fix him, l have no time
to fool around with him.

249
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,203
l'm trying to save someone's life
here, do you understand?

250
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:20,973
You should be more flexible,
you know?

251
00:20:22,118 --> 00:20:24,199
Have you locked the lift?

252
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,489
- Where's the key?
- l don't have it.

253
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:27,635
- Did you press the button?
- No!

254
00:20:27,636 --> 00:20:30,758
You're blocking the sensor,
stand back.

255
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:32,321
Stand back!

256
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,299
Don't block the sensors.

257
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,254
lnspector Wong's come.

258
00:20:38,255 --> 00:20:39,088
Give me a walkie-talkie.

259
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,543
lnspector Wong.

260
00:20:46,376 --> 00:20:47,937
Who's calling me?

261
00:20:49,187 --> 00:20:50,436
The lift is coming up.

262
00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:52,413
Who's so nice to give you
a helping hand?

263
00:20:52,414 --> 00:20:54,287
How come the SDU is dealing with
such a tiny matter?

264
00:20:54,288 --> 00:20:55,745
The suspect doesn't want to
talk to Hui!

265
00:20:55,746 --> 00:20:57,516
So we're forced to change negotiator.

266
00:21:00,431 --> 00:21:02,305
He's stalling.

267
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:05,739
Did you talk to him?

268
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,781
l didn't say that much.

269
00:21:07,823 --> 00:21:10,424
You can't keep your mouth shut!

270
00:21:10,425 --> 00:21:12,091
How can l not say anything when he's
standing right in front of me?

271
00:21:23,752 --> 00:21:25,938
There you are! l've been
waiting for ages.

272
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:29,061
l'm sorry. l was stuck in traffic.

273
00:21:31,976 --> 00:21:33,641
You mind...

274
00:21:33,642 --> 00:21:35,204
l get closer to talk to you?

275
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,870
l'm not armed.

276
00:21:42,492 --> 00:21:44,885
Sniper 1 , report you position!

277
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:45,927
Sniper 2?

278
00:21:46,552 --> 00:21:50,092
Sniper 2, wait...

279
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:54,985
Sniper one reporting,
we can't see the suspect.

280
00:21:56,026 --> 00:21:59,045
Sniper two reporting, the suspect is
blocking himself with he hostage.

281
00:21:59,357 --> 00:22:00,918
He's behind a pole.

282
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:03,625
l'm lnspector Ho Sheung-sang,
how can l help you?

283
00:22:03,626 --> 00:22:06,021
l think you pretty much know
in these situations what they want.

284
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,310
Some want money, a car.

285
00:22:08,311 --> 00:22:10,081
An airplane,
or sometimes to see his wife.

286
00:22:11,018 --> 00:22:12,267
Do you have a girlfriend?

287
00:22:13,412 --> 00:22:14,662
Never mind.

288
00:22:16,328 --> 00:22:17,993
l don't want those things.

289
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,950
Don't move!

290
00:22:25,073 --> 00:22:27,467
Officer Ho is blocking the suspect,
we can't get a good shot.

291
00:22:27,884 --> 00:22:29,340
Smart, eh?

292
00:22:29,341 --> 00:22:30,486
Yes!

293
00:22:30,487 --> 00:22:31,943
Can you tell me your name?

294
00:22:31,944 --> 00:22:33,089
You can find out pretty easily.

295
00:22:34,339 --> 00:22:35,484
What the hell do you want?

296
00:22:35,796 --> 00:22:36,733
Nothing.

297
00:22:37,462 --> 00:22:39,961
l just want to play a game with you
for 72 hours.

298
00:22:41,418 --> 00:22:45,478
Shit, a fool meets another fool now.

299
00:22:45,479 --> 00:22:48,289
You just want to play a game with me?

300
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:49,434
That's right!

301
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:50,371
Okay but the hostage is innocent.

302
00:22:50,372 --> 00:22:52,349
Please let him go.

303
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,495
l'll take his place.

304
00:22:54,953 --> 00:22:55,993
The suspect has shot the hostage.

305
00:22:55,994 --> 00:22:57,243
A Team break in!

306
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,493
Move!

307
00:23:09,528 --> 00:23:10,881
Freeze!

308
00:23:10,882 --> 00:23:12,339
This is a pressure starter.

309
00:23:13,068 --> 00:23:15,879
lf l drop it, a bomb will explode.

310
00:23:16,712 --> 00:23:18,794
Wong Kai-fai, look at
where you are standing.

311
00:23:29,934 --> 00:23:32,328
You're holding this piece of shit
and want me to believe it's a bomb?

312
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:35,452
You don't believe it? Try me!

313
00:23:35,972 --> 00:23:38,575
l don't believe it, go ahead.

314
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:42,635
Go ahead!

315
00:23:42,636 --> 00:23:43,781
l believe you, don't do it!

316
00:23:45,655 --> 00:23:47,528
The bomb's a fake!

317
00:23:47,529 --> 00:23:48,778
How do you know?

318
00:23:52,006 --> 00:23:53,566
Would you please trust me for once?

319
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:55,232
Why should l trust you and not him?

320
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:56,481
lf it explodes, l'll be blamed.

321
00:23:56,482 --> 00:23:57,939
lf it doesn't, l won't be blamed.

322
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,437
You're a policeman,
would you be a bit braver?

323
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,521
You don't even know
if it's real of fake.

324
00:24:08,143 --> 00:24:10,432
Don't move,
there are more that two bombs.

325
00:24:10,433 --> 00:24:11,994
lf it explodes, l won't
take the responsibility.

326
00:24:11,995 --> 00:24:13,139
Don't move!

327
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,806
So, you will watch me leave.

328
00:24:21,261 --> 00:24:22,509
Command car!

329
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,239
Roger!

330
00:24:23,655 --> 00:24:25,113
Ask the bomb disposal unit
to come up here.

331
00:24:25,842 --> 00:24:26,779
Copy!

332
00:24:28,548 --> 00:24:29,590
Look!

333
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:32,921
Help...l'm still alive...

334
00:24:33,233 --> 00:24:34,483
Help! ls there any anybody?

335
00:24:37,502 --> 00:24:38,334
What's it say?

336
00:24:38,335 --> 00:24:39,479
What?

337
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,562
What a mess!

338
00:24:46,872 --> 00:24:48,745
Check where the shaft leads to...

339
00:24:48,746 --> 00:24:49,787
Okay?

340
00:24:52,078 --> 00:24:53,639
Ask the manager to come up here.

341
00:25:39,864 --> 00:25:41,529
How can you let him escape?

342
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:44,653
Forget about it, l'm asking you
where this pipe leads to.

343
00:25:44,654 --> 00:25:46,319
All doors lead to the control room.

344
00:25:47,465 --> 00:25:49,651
But don't worry,
he can't escape this building.

345
00:25:50,276 --> 00:25:51,733
Check the blue prints now.

346
00:26:43,164 --> 00:26:45,037
Don't talk to me,
you had a great opportunity.

347
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:47,431
But you said one sentence
that you shouldn't have.

348
00:26:47,432 --> 00:26:50,242
And now it's turned into this.

349
00:26:50,243 --> 00:26:51,493
How do we get him back?

350
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:53,783
Every comer of this building
is covered, how can he escape?

351
00:26:54,304 --> 00:26:55,656
He can disguise himself...

352
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:56,489
As a SDU member and escape.

353
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,259
By now he could be
walking on the street.

354
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,301
What are you, writing a script?

355
00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:03,881
Senior, what's happened?

356
00:27:03,882 --> 00:27:04,715
One of our men has been attacked.

357
00:27:12,523 --> 00:27:14,085
Officer Wong,
we're on the 18th floor.

358
00:27:14,397 --> 00:27:16,374
One of our men is suspected
to be attacked by a SDU member.

359
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:17,416
l'll be right there.

360
00:27:18,666 --> 00:27:20,332
You'd up to the 18th floor.

361
00:27:27,411 --> 00:27:28,660
What did you say?

362
00:28:52,678 --> 00:28:53,823
Where in Tsimshasui?

363
00:28:54,448 --> 00:28:55,281
The pier, please.

364
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,916
Where do you want to go?

365
00:29:13,917 --> 00:29:15,062
To the nearest police station.

366
00:29:20,684 --> 00:29:21,932
You alone?

367
00:29:21,933 --> 00:29:22,870
Yep!

368
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:24,640
You're not armed.

369
00:29:25,577 --> 00:29:26,825
Aren't you afraid that
l might kill you?

370
00:29:26,826 --> 00:29:27,867
lf you shoot.

371
00:29:29,533 --> 00:29:30,886
The care will flip over.

372
00:29:30,887 --> 00:29:33,385
Yes, it's dangerous.

373
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:38,591
lf you can take me
to the police station, you win.

374
00:29:51,396 --> 00:00:59,579
l don't always aim accurately.

One!

Two!

385
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:16,487
Three!

386
00:30:28,876 --> 00:30:30,646
Sorry, the men from the Organized
Crime Bureau want your statement.

387
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:33,560
Sir, l can't hold it,
l need to go to toilet.

388
00:30:33,561 --> 00:30:35,851
You can't remove this,
we need to do some tests.

389
00:30:35,852 --> 00:30:36,893
l need to go,
l can't hold it anymore.

390
00:30:37,518 --> 00:30:39,182
You can't remove
the stuff off your face.

391
00:30:39,183 --> 00:30:40,120
Don't wash your hand.

392
00:31:43,732 --> 00:31:45,190
Just keep quiet and you'll be fine.

393
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:12,987
Move over.

394
00:32:46,407 --> 00:32:47,447
What is this?

395
00:32:47,448 --> 00:32:48,592
Old clothes!

396
00:32:48,593 --> 00:32:49,530
Open it and let me see.

397
00:32:52,758 --> 00:32:53,694
Where are you talking them to?

398
00:32:53,695 --> 00:32:55,361
l'm going to take them to my
relatives living in Mainland China.

399
00:33:28,051 --> 00:33:29,092
Driver, you can move.

400
00:33:58,452 --> 00:33:59,492
Thank you!

401
00:33:59,493 --> 00:34:00,846
Stop at the intersection.

402
00:34:13,964 --> 00:34:15,005
Stop at the gas station.

403
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,759
Why are you following me?

404
00:34:47,488 --> 00:34:48,841
l live here.

405
00:34:57,379 --> 00:34:58,628
This is yours.

406
00:35:08,518 --> 00:35:09,975
No...just remember one thing...

407
00:35:09,976 --> 00:35:11,953
Sometimes one plus one
never equals two.

408
00:35:11,954 --> 00:35:13,932
l bet you,
he will not leave Hong Kong.

409
00:35:14,453 --> 00:35:16,223
So, is he waiting for the police
to catch him?

410
00:35:16,535 --> 00:35:18,928
You should think over the whole case.

411
00:35:18,929 --> 00:35:21,011
Then you will find out
he is not your ordinary robber.

412
00:35:21,012 --> 00:35:23,094
What is his target?
What is his motive?

413
00:35:23,406 --> 00:35:25,071
lsn't it worth it to think it over?

414
00:35:25,072 --> 00:35:26,946
l know he's been transferred as
a clerical staff.

415
00:35:27,779 --> 00:35:30,485
He ruined the case just because
he didn't listen to my orders.

416
00:35:30,486 --> 00:35:32,360
That's why the robber
was able to escape.

417
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,003
l've put up with enough.

418
00:35:36,004 --> 00:35:37,564
This is not the first time.

419
00:35:37,565 --> 00:35:38,815
Just like the last time...

420
00:35:39,231 --> 00:35:43,291
l'm not giving you a hard time,
l don't mean that...

421
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:48,289
l know you two are buddies.

422
00:35:50,683 --> 00:35:53,390
l'm sorry, l understand that now.

423
00:35:55,681 --> 00:35:56,826
Good-bye, Sir!

424
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:01,197
lt's best if we put ourselves
in the shoes of the robber.

425
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:02,239
Think what he is thinking.

426
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,696
Of course,
he must be a very smart guy.

427
00:36:03,697 --> 00:36:04,425
Officer Wong!

428
00:36:04,426 --> 00:36:05,675
Go and check the evidence.

429
00:36:06,612 --> 00:36:09,214
Many shops sell SDU uniforms...

430
00:36:09,215 --> 00:36:10,463
Check this out.

431
00:36:10,464 --> 00:36:11,506
The sergeant is doing it now.

432
00:36:12,026 --> 00:36:14,004
Take this to the armament department
and check it.

433
00:36:14,421 --> 00:36:17,231
The expert said
this is regularly sold.

434
00:36:17,232 --> 00:36:18,272
He can't see anything special.

435
00:36:18,273 --> 00:36:19,521
Check the finger prints.

436
00:36:19,522 --> 00:36:20,875
Officer Ho said
there weren't any finger prints.

437
00:36:21,188 --> 00:36:22,958
The guy may have put some glue
on his fingers.

438
00:36:23,478 --> 00:36:24,935
Get a picture for me, okay?

439
00:36:24,936 --> 00:36:26,185
lt's done,
we've got the warrant already.

440
00:36:26,497 --> 00:36:28,163
What are we forgetting?

441
00:36:31,078 --> 00:36:33,785
Stupid. l'm so stupid!

442
00:36:34,306 --> 00:36:36,596
l forgot the most important clue,
the finance company.

443
00:36:37,221 --> 00:36:38,783
l forgot the most obvious clue.

444
00:36:39,095 --> 00:36:40,761
We can check there.

445
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:44,300
Ask someone to change the light
in the corridor.

446
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:59,188
l haven't seen you for ages,
l thought you were dead.

447
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,578
Don't think that
l'm back to help you.

448
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:14,180
l just want to
take a look at the diamond.

449
00:37:33,857 --> 00:37:35,522
lt's short 5 million!

450
00:37:35,523 --> 00:37:37,501
Each person gets 2.5 million.

451
00:37:37,813 --> 00:37:39,063
The other two guys didn't come!

452
00:37:39,583 --> 00:37:40,519
They're dead...

453
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,915
And the Russian Mafia are still
looking for us!

454
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:44,789
lt's your problem, not mine.

455
00:37:45,205 --> 00:37:47,392
lf the diamond's real,
then you can leave.

456
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:55,200
ls it real or not?

457
00:37:58,011 --> 00:37:59,052
lt's real!

458
00:38:00,301 --> 00:38:01,447
l say it's fake.

459
00:38:04,154 --> 00:38:05,299
l say it's real.

460
00:38:06,548 --> 00:38:08,109
- lt's fake.
- What games are you playing?

461
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,046
Don't waste my time.

462
00:38:09,047 --> 00:38:09,774
Give me the money,

463
00:38:09,776 --> 00:38:11,545
and let me get the damn out of here.

464
00:38:24,455 --> 00:38:27,162
lf you want to sell it,
l've got a buyer.

465
00:38:29,036 --> 00:38:29,973
Fix him.

466
00:38:33,617 --> 00:38:36,116
Call me, 20% commission for me.

467
00:38:43,091 --> 00:38:45,486
l have nothing to say,
l told you everything l know.

468
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:48,088
You've been asking
the same questions.

469
00:38:48,817 --> 00:38:51,002
- l'm bored, aren't you bored too?
- Yes, l'm understand.

470
00:38:51,003 --> 00:38:54,334
Never mind,
just tell me all the details.

471
00:38:54,335 --> 00:38:57,353
An eyesight, a movement, a smile.

472
00:38:57,354 --> 00:38:58,604
Andy words you heard...

473
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:00,477
- l've got you name card.
- Just anything...

474
00:39:00,478 --> 00:39:01,309
You remember.

475
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:02,246
l'll let you know
if l remember anything.

476
00:39:02,247 --> 00:39:03,600
- Don't forget to call me.
- Thank you, Officer.

477
00:39:03,601 --> 00:39:04,746
Anytime will do.

478
00:39:23,382 --> 00:39:24,423
3215.

479
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,144
This diamond worthies 80 million.

480
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,641
Be smart, keep an eye on it
round the clock.

481
00:39:42,642 --> 00:39:43,371
Yes!

482
00:40:05,026 --> 00:40:05,859
What's up?

483
00:40:06,172 --> 00:40:07,317
Nothing, l'm just looking.

484
00:40:07,733 --> 00:40:09,191
And you company...

485
00:40:10,544 --> 00:40:11,376
Nothing.

486
00:40:11,377 --> 00:40:13,043
l think it's beautifully decorated.

487
00:40:13,563 --> 00:40:14,500
What are you?

488
00:40:20,331 --> 00:40:21,372
Why do you ask?

489
00:40:23,246 --> 00:40:24,078
l'm a cop.

490
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,016
l work in the transportation field.

491
00:40:26,369 --> 00:40:28,347
A robbery happened there.

492
00:40:28,764 --> 00:40:30,428
Did you see anyone suspicious?

493
00:40:30,429 --> 00:40:32,408
The police have asked
thousands of time.

494
00:40:32,928 --> 00:40:34,177
Thousands of times.

495
00:40:35,323 --> 00:40:36,676
Sorry to bother you.

496
00:40:37,197 --> 00:40:38,342
Thousands of times!

497
00:40:46,462 --> 00:40:47,608
l was just going to go to the toilet.

498
00:40:50,731 --> 00:40:51,564
Okay, l'm not going.

499
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:48,513
l have two questions for you...

500
00:41:49,345 --> 00:41:52,155
First, why did he
rob the finance company?

501
00:41:52,156 --> 00:41:55,175
There are jewelry and antique shops
in the same building.

502
00:41:55,176 --> 00:41:57,050
lf it was for the money,
he could have robbed those shops.

503
00:41:57,362 --> 00:41:58,820
Why did he rob the finance company?

504
00:41:59,444 --> 00:42:01,735
This means he wasn't
concerned with the money.

505
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,211
Second, why me? Why did he chose me?

506
00:42:07,044 --> 00:42:08,398
Why did he plan so many things
on the roof?

507
00:42:09,022 --> 00:42:10,168
So, l'm positive.

508
00:42:10,792 --> 00:42:12,874
He wanted to get something from me.

509
00:42:12,875 --> 00:42:14,644
Or, he wanted to achieve something
by using me.

510
00:42:15,998 --> 00:42:17,664
So everyone think it over.

511
00:42:21,099 --> 00:42:22,140
What do you say?

512
00:42:23,286 --> 00:42:25,056
lt's five o'clock,
it's already five o'clock.

513
00:42:25,993 --> 00:42:27,762
Right, your son
is getting off school.

514
00:42:28,387 --> 00:42:29,116
You have a mahjong appointment.

515
00:42:29,428 --> 00:42:30,469
You want to go home for dinner.

516
00:42:30,782 --> 00:42:31,927
And you want to go to Shenzhen.

517
00:42:35,987 --> 00:42:37,653
l want to go to a concert.

518
00:42:40,152 --> 00:42:41,193
Time to get off work...

519
00:42:41,609 --> 00:42:42,963
lt's a already five!
lt's definitely time to get off.

520
00:42:44,733 --> 00:42:45,564
Officer Ho, see you.

521
00:42:45,565 --> 00:42:47,230
- See you!
- See you!

522
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,105
Officer Ho, l almost forgot,
this came for you.

523
00:43:14,612 --> 00:43:15,862
This is what you asked for.

524
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:19,817
You're really good! lf you work fast,
you'll get promoted fast.

525
00:43:19,818 --> 00:43:22,316
No one knows more than you.

526
00:43:22,317 --> 00:43:24,399
You've worked in
almost every department.

527
00:43:24,815 --> 00:43:26,064
Luckily you don't know
anything about music.

528
00:43:26,065 --> 00:43:28,459
Otherwise
you'd join the police band too.

529
00:43:28,771 --> 00:43:31,374
You're right!
l don't like to blow things.

530
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:35,851
Who is this guy?

531
00:43:36,996 --> 00:43:39,703
His name is Peter Cheung,
he is the Master of Bald Cheung.

532
00:43:40,328 --> 00:43:43,658
Three years ago,
he was kicked out by Cheung.

533
00:43:43,659 --> 00:43:44,909
We don't have any news on him.

534
00:43:45,533 --> 00:43:46,990
l heard that he's gone to the UK.

535
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:47,824
The UK?

536
00:43:48,553 --> 00:43:50,425
l've sent an e-mail...

537
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:52,195
To seek help from lnterpol.

538
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:54,175
lt's lunch time now...

539
00:43:54,487 --> 00:43:55,632
ln the UK!

540
00:43:56,257 --> 00:43:58,130
l think we should
get an answer later.

541
00:43:58,131 --> 00:43:58,964
Good!

542
00:44:00,213 --> 00:44:01,358
Where are we going to eat now?

543
00:44:01,775 --> 00:44:03,335
l think there are...

544
00:44:03,336 --> 00:44:05,938
Some British people on diets.

545
00:44:05,939 --> 00:44:07,500
They may stay at the office to work.

546
00:44:07,501 --> 00:44:09,061
Okay, you go back
to the office and wait.

547
00:44:09,062 --> 00:44:10,623
lnform me it you get anything.

548
00:44:10,624 --> 00:44:13,019
You don't have a wife
and you don't fool around.

549
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,621
You know, many colleagues say
you're gay.

550
00:44:19,473 --> 00:44:20,515
Do you think l'm gay?

551
00:44:21,347 --> 00:44:22,180
By the way...

552
00:44:23,221 --> 00:44:24,263
How's it going with
the finance company?

553
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:28,948
Nothing suspicious.
They run a clean business.

554
00:44:30,093 --> 00:44:32,279
That bastard has no motive
to rob that company.

555
00:44:34,778 --> 00:44:35,819
What'd you just ask me?

556
00:44:36,756 --> 00:44:38,525
Nothing...can you take me to my car?

557
00:44:38,526 --> 00:44:39,775
lnform me if you hear any new.

558
00:45:11,321 --> 00:45:13,091
Organized Crime Bureau,
please wait...

559
00:45:13,819 --> 00:45:14,860
Officer Wong, line three.

560
00:45:19,129 --> 00:45:19,961
l am police officer.

561
00:45:19,962 --> 00:45:21,627
An officer Ho here...

562
00:45:21,628 --> 00:45:23,710
Who wants to check the crime scene.

563
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:25,791
My supervisor instructed me...

564
00:45:25,792 --> 00:45:28,394
To notify the police station first.

565
00:45:28,395 --> 00:45:30,998
Never mind him.
He isn't in charge of this case.

566
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:32,768
lf he comes again,
call me immediately.

567
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,642
Don't think l'm such a whimp.

568
00:45:35,995 --> 00:45:39,014
That office said you're not
in charge of this case.

569
00:45:39,327 --> 00:45:42,866
You'd better call him first.

570
00:45:48,905 --> 00:45:50,050
l have to lock up now.

571
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:52,757
Go!

572
00:45:56,505 --> 00:45:58,067
l am sorry, please help yourself.

573
00:46:18,993 --> 00:46:20,242
Where's the milk powder?

574
00:46:43,875 --> 00:46:48,040
Shit, l've forgotten to
tell him the number.

575
00:47:09,591 --> 00:47:11,257
3951 .

576
00:48:56,825 --> 00:48:58,074
Camera face.

577
00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:33,056
Go check the corridor.

578
00:49:34,201 --> 00:49:35,346
Suet, do you hear me?

579
00:49:35,762 --> 00:49:36,804
Copy!

580
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:38,573
Someone is coming.

581
00:49:39,927 --> 00:49:41,489
ls there someone coming up?

582
00:49:42,217 --> 00:49:43,154
He's here, Someone's come up!

583
00:49:47,215 --> 00:49:48,672
He's here, Someone's come up!

584
00:49:52,108 --> 00:49:53,045
Someone's come up!

585
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,809
You go up there and
l'll go in the back.

586
00:50:21,571 --> 00:50:23,133
Boss, there's something going on
in the office.

587
00:50:23,549 --> 00:50:24,694
ls the diamond there?

588
00:50:24,695 --> 00:50:26,984
Yes, but a camera is set up
next to the safe.

589
00:50:26,985 --> 00:50:27,817
Take the case,

590
00:50:27,818 --> 00:50:29,587
and wait for me at the parking lot
in 15 minutes.

591
00:50:29,588 --> 00:50:30,317
Okay!

592
00:51:09,462 --> 00:51:10,295
Downstairs!

593
00:51:47,775 --> 00:51:49,023
Why did you hang up?

594
00:51:49,024 --> 00:51:49,960
Who are you?

595
00:51:49,961 --> 00:51:51,731
lt's me, Officer Ho!

596
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,561
Don't you know...

597
00:51:57,562 --> 00:51:59,123
The hails almost killed me?

598
00:51:59,748 --> 00:52:01,622
You think
l'm someone you can around with.

599
00:52:02,767 --> 00:52:03,808
Don't take the lift.

600
00:52:05,474 --> 00:52:06,515
Let's go jogging.

601
00:52:09,222 --> 00:52:10,159
Don't look for it anymore.

602
00:52:16,406 --> 00:52:17,759
Someone's coming up.

603
00:52:24,006 --> 00:52:25,672
Three guns for the three of you.

604
00:52:27,025 --> 00:52:29,211
What do you have? An ash-tray?

605
00:52:30,461 --> 00:52:32,334
No one messes with me.

606
00:52:32,335 --> 00:52:33,376
Me too.

607
00:52:48,472 --> 00:52:49,513
What are we going to do now?

608
00:52:49,825 --> 00:52:51,387
What time is it now?

609
00:52:53,053 --> 00:52:55,239
Ten twenty nine,
don't you have a watch?

610
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:57,113
Which floor are you on?

611
00:52:58,571 --> 00:52:59,403
The fifth floor!

612
00:52:59,716 --> 00:53:01,486
How many floors can you
run in one minute?

613
00:53:02,735 --> 00:53:03,880
What do you want?

614
00:53:04,297 --> 00:53:07,003
Let me tell you, there's
an emergency exit on the ground floor.

615
00:53:07,004 --> 00:53:08,253
lt locks automatically at 10:30.

616
00:53:08,773 --> 00:53:12,313
You still have thirty seconds...
No, 28...

617
00:53:13,354 --> 00:53:15,645
27, 26...

618
00:53:27,305 --> 00:53:29,387
10, 9...

619
00:53:30,324 --> 00:53:33,655
- The system is armed.
- 8, 7...

620
00:53:33,656 --> 00:53:36,259
6, 5...

621
00:53:54,999 --> 00:53:56,873
So, you used me to draw
the others' attention away.

622
00:53:57,810 --> 00:53:58,850
You asshole!

623
00:53:58,851 --> 00:54:01,037
No more cursing,
think of a way to escape.

624
00:55:07,148 --> 00:55:08,085
You...

625
00:55:46,606 --> 00:55:47,646
Boss...

626
00:55:47,647 --> 00:55:48,688
Thank you!

627
00:55:57,433 --> 00:55:59,202
Why did the tire blow?

628
00:55:59,203 --> 00:56:00,244
Get in!

629
00:56:30,436 --> 00:56:31,269
Wake up...

630
00:56:39,078 --> 00:56:40,430
Wake up!

631
00:56:40,431 --> 00:56:41,576
After him!

632
00:57:15,829 --> 00:57:16,766
You following me?

633
00:57:58,827 --> 00:58:01,013
You're really something else,
how dare you use me!

634
00:58:01,325 --> 00:58:02,157
Bingo!

635
00:58:02,158 --> 00:58:05,281
Not bad. You're able to keep up.

636
00:58:05,594 --> 00:58:06,530
But you're looking for trouble.

637
00:58:06,531 --> 00:58:07,572
What do you suggest?

638
00:58:08,301 --> 00:58:10,071
Don't ask! You'll figure it out.

639
00:58:34,849 --> 00:58:36,515
Don't light it so fast.

640
00:59:05,145 --> 00:59:07,332
Give me the gun.
l'm getting out of here.

641
00:59:36,587 --> 00:59:38,565
The car is bumbing against us, run!

642
00:59:45,228 --> 00:59:46,164
Has it exploded?

643
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:47,310
Shut up! Check what's happening.

644
00:59:47,727 --> 00:59:48,767
lsn't it gonna explode?

645
00:59:48,768 --> 00:59:49,808
Nothing's happening.

646
00:59:49,809 --> 00:59:51,475
Go take a look.

647
00:59:55,431 --> 00:59:56,887
l haven't experienced
such excitement in years.

648
00:59:56,888 --> 00:59:58,033
l have you to thank.

649
00:59:58,034 --> 00:59:58,866
What did you steal?

650
00:59:59,283 --> 01:00:00,428
lt was stolen by the bald guy.

651
01:00:00,845 --> 01:00:02,094
lt's a diamond
worth 80 million dollars.

652
01:00:03,343 --> 01:00:05,634
We've swapped positions.

653
01:00:06,362 --> 01:00:11,152
Last time l drove
and you had the gun.

654
01:00:13,338 --> 01:00:14,900
You are heartless.

655
01:00:15,212 --> 01:00:17,709
Do you remember
how you got out of the building?

656
01:00:17,711 --> 01:00:19,168
lf it weren't for me.

657
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,459
How would you be able to escape?

658
01:00:21,771 --> 01:00:23,020
We're using each other.

659
01:00:23,333 --> 01:00:27,497
So don't forget to watch your back.

660
01:00:27,601 --> 01:00:30,412
Right! Do you know where
the nearest police station is?

661
01:00:30,724 --> 01:00:31,661
Yes!

662
01:00:34,264 --> 01:00:38,324
Same rule, if you're able to take me
to police station, you win.

663
01:00:38,949 --> 01:00:39,782
Alright!

664
01:00:44,467 --> 01:00:45,820
Don't think
you'll be able to get away.

665
01:00:57,481 --> 01:00:58,418
What's the matter with you?

666
01:03:28,754 --> 01:03:30,316
There's nothing wrong
with your brain.

667
01:03:31,149 --> 01:03:33,959
lf you're still worried, come back
for another check up it two days.

668
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:34,897
Okay, thank you.

669
01:03:39,061 --> 01:03:39,893
Officer Ho!

670
01:03:39,894 --> 01:03:42,184
Officer Ho, Officer Wong asked you
to wait for him.

671
01:03:43,017 --> 01:03:44,370
Tell Officer Wong for me that.

672
01:03:44,371 --> 01:03:46,661
l've already waited for a long time,
l have to go now.

673
01:03:47,078 --> 01:03:50,409
No...Officer Ho,
don't give me a hard time...

674
01:03:54,261 --> 01:03:55,511
Officer Ho, come here for a moment.

675
01:03:56,031 --> 01:03:56,760
Officer Wong.

676
01:03:57,176 --> 01:03:58,425
Wait for me in the lobby please.

677
01:03:58,426 --> 01:03:59,675
Yes Sir...

678
01:04:03,007 --> 01:04:05,401
Don't lie to me.

679
01:04:07,067 --> 01:04:08,836
Well, l have a lunch appointment
with a friend.

680
01:04:08,837 --> 01:04:10,711
- On the way, l come across...
- We found your car.

681
01:04:11,335 --> 01:04:14,041
lt's like the one that crashed,
bullets holes were everywhere.

682
01:04:14,042 --> 01:04:15,915
Someone's after me,
there's nothing l can do.

683
01:04:15,916 --> 01:04:17,477
We're the police,
we have a lot of enemies.

684
01:04:17,478 --> 01:04:18,727
Are you still trying to lie to me?

685
01:04:20,705 --> 01:04:21,642
What's this?

686
01:04:22,267 --> 01:04:24,453
This was found near your car.

687
01:04:25,390 --> 01:04:26,432
l asked the doctor.

688
01:04:26,952 --> 01:04:30,388
There are pain killers for
a cancer patient in his last stage.

689
01:04:34,448 --> 01:04:36,947
What a pity. You're so young.

690
01:04:42,361 --> 01:04:46,213
lt's my fault that
l'm biased against you.

691
01:04:47,358 --> 01:04:49,961
You always pick on me.

692
01:04:50,689 --> 01:04:53,188
And you know l'm the Chief
and l'm your senior.

693
01:04:54,854 --> 01:04:56,520
lf you keep taking these pills,
they'll agitate you.

694
01:04:59,331 --> 01:05:02,558
l'm sorry...

695
01:05:04,848 --> 01:05:07,035
Be honest with me.

696
01:05:08,388 --> 01:05:10,261
Maybe, l can help.

697
01:05:10,262 --> 01:05:11,302
lnspector Ho.

698
01:05:11,303 --> 01:05:12,344
Any news?

699
01:05:14,947 --> 01:05:17,238
What happened to you?
l just saw you a couple hours ago.

700
01:05:21,506 --> 01:05:22,964
ls Peter Cheung dead?

701
01:05:23,484 --> 01:05:25,983
He died in England on October 13th
of last year.

702
01:05:26,712 --> 01:05:28,169
lt's be a year tomorrow.

703
01:05:28,898 --> 01:05:30,146
ls tomorrow the 13th?

704
01:05:30,147 --> 01:05:31,605
Yes, Friday the 13th.

705
01:05:39,934 --> 01:05:41,286
Who's he?

706
01:05:41,287 --> 01:05:42,953
The guy who robbed
the finance company.

707
01:05:43,474 --> 01:05:44,618
He's Peter Cheung's son.

708
01:05:44,619 --> 01:05:45,867
He's been living in England.

709
01:05:45,868 --> 01:05:47,325
Since Peter Cheung's death...

710
01:05:47,326 --> 01:05:48,575
His son's where abouts are unknown.

711
01:05:51,074 --> 01:05:52,740
You're gay. l'm not.

712
01:05:53,468 --> 01:05:55,759
l'm sorry, thank you!

713
01:05:57,425 --> 01:05:58,570
Are you okay!

714
01:05:59,090 --> 01:06:01,693
l'm fine! l owe you one.
l'll remember.

715
01:06:02,838 --> 01:06:03,774
l'm leaving now.

716
01:06:03,775 --> 01:06:05,441
- See you!
- Good-bye!

717
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,523
Who is she? She's got
a lot useful information.

718
01:06:07,836 --> 01:06:08,980
Head of lnterpol.

719
01:06:08,981 --> 01:06:10,751
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

720
01:06:11,063 --> 01:06:14,707
Madam, let me give you a ride.

721
01:06:15,436 --> 01:06:16,269
The lift's here.

722
01:06:16,685 --> 01:06:17,726
Thank you!

723
01:06:18,663 --> 01:06:20,328
Madam,

724

l am Chief lnspector Wong Kai-fat...

725
01:06:26,367 --> 01:06:28,241
Boss you've got a DHL document.

726
01:06:38,757 --> 01:06:40,526
You're kidding me, Peter.

727
01:06:40,943 --> 01:06:42,817
An eye for an eye.

l've already kicked you ass before...

732
01:06:45,003 --> 01:06:47,398
So what makes you think
you can beat me now?

733
01:06:47,814 --> 01:06:49,168
So, we have nothing to say then.

734
01:06:58,850 --> 01:07:00,098
What the hell do you want?

735
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:03,222
Money, l just want 20 million.

736
01:07:03,223 --> 01:07:05,200
So much money!
How are you going to spend it all?

737
01:07:05,201 --> 01:07:06,346
You can't take it with you
when you die!

738
01:07:15,404 --> 01:07:16,965
When? Where?

739
01:07:17,486 --> 01:07:19,672
l'll call you again. Bye!

740
01:07:26,023 --> 01:07:28,000
- You know where the bar is, right?
- Yes!

741
01:07:28,001 --> 01:07:31,436
l'm going now but remember, never...

742
01:07:31,437 --> 01:07:33,101
Never use the walkie-talkie.

743
01:07:33,102 --> 01:07:34,663
As soon as you give me the word,
my buddies and l will go.

744
01:07:34,664 --> 01:07:37,163
- Alright?
- Smartass!

745
01:07:47,157 --> 01:07:48,199
You're early, lnspector.

746
01:07:48,927 --> 01:07:51,218
Yes, l've got a date.

747
01:08:00,275 --> 01:08:01,004
Sit down.

748
01:08:06,314 --> 01:08:09,021
You're made some
accurate predictions, Mr. Cheung.

749
01:08:11,415 --> 01:08:12,352
Have you checked that out?

750
01:08:14,018 --> 01:08:16,829
You've stolen the diamond and
you've avenged your dad.

751
01:08:17,662 --> 01:08:18,911
Why do you want to see me?

752
01:08:22,555 --> 01:08:25,158
l told you before,
this game lasts for three days.

753
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:27,761
Did you forget?

754
01:08:28,698 --> 01:08:29,842
Today's included.

755
01:08:29,843 --> 01:08:32,237
But now you're not in charge.
Remember, l'm the police.

756
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:37,755
Clear the warehouse
and change the lights.

757
01:08:38,068 --> 01:08:39,941
So much time,
how are we going to spend it?

758
01:08:39,942 --> 01:08:40,879
Aren't you bored?

759
01:08:41,503 --> 01:08:42,753
Or are you afraid that
you might lose?

760
01:08:43,273 --> 01:08:45,564
lf you are afraid of losing,
then take me back.

761
01:08:46,188 --> 01:08:47,958
lt's useless trying to make me mad.

762
01:08:48,895 --> 01:08:50,457
Besides, you're not afraid of
being arrested.

763
01:08:51,498 --> 01:08:52,747
And you're not afraid of
being put behind bars.

764
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:55,871
l think, you'll die
before we send you to court.

765
01:08:56,391 --> 01:08:57,952
Right, nothing to be scared of.

766
01:08:57,953 --> 01:08:59,827
l'm sorry...

767
01:09:00,347 --> 01:09:04,304
Alright, l'll give you
one minute to convince me.

768
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:05,657
lf you convince me.

769
01:09:06,386 --> 01:09:07,948
l won't ask my buddies to come in.

770
01:09:09,405 --> 01:09:11,800
59, 58...

771
01:09:14,611 --> 01:09:16,901
The bald guy has to deliver
the diamond in three days.

772
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:19,192
l've got the diamond.

773
01:09:20,129 --> 01:09:22,627
l make an appointment with him
and of course he'll show up.

774
01:09:23,044 --> 01:09:24,396
There, you'll catch him red handed
and arrest him.

775
01:09:24,397 --> 01:09:25,438
l'm just helping you out.

776
01:09:26,583 --> 01:09:27,624
Thirty seconds left.

777
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:31,893
There are many in lnterpol
working on this case.

778
01:09:32,205 --> 01:09:33,871
lf you can nail him,
you'll achieve something big.

779
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:36,370
You'll get a chance to transfer.

780
01:09:37,515 --> 01:09:38,660
Fifteen seconds...

781
01:09:39,597 --> 01:09:40,847
You seem to
enjoy this game very much.

782
01:09:41,263 --> 01:09:42,721
There's one more day.
Why don't you join the game?

783
01:09:43,866 --> 01:09:46,260
Ten, nine, eight...

784
01:09:46,677 --> 01:09:48,655
Do you know what you look like these
past two days?

785
01:09:49,696 --> 01:09:51,778
Only the tail is missing,
otherwise you look like a dog.

786
01:09:52,819 --> 01:09:56,047
- You're dragged around...
- Four, three...

787
01:10:03,126 --> 01:10:04,896
You were tricked into coming here.

788
01:10:15,307 --> 01:10:16,661
That's the rear exit.

789
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:21,346
Let me mess with you again.

790
01:10:33,735 --> 01:10:34,983
Haven't they come yet?
l'm leaving now.

791
01:10:34,984 --> 01:10:36,233
He's gone.

792
01:10:36,234 --> 01:10:37,690
What's wrong with you?
You know l've been outside.

793
01:10:37,691 --> 01:10:39,461
My urine was really yellow
this morning.

794
01:10:41,856 --> 01:10:42,793
l'm sorry...

795
01:10:43,105 --> 01:10:44,874
Don't worry,
just drink some herbal tea.

796
01:10:44,875 --> 01:10:46,645
My urine was yellow too.

797
01:10:47,998 --> 01:10:50,601
l have an idea to
get you definitely promoted.

798
01:10:51,850 --> 01:10:53,100
l was sorry.

799
01:10:53,516 --> 01:10:54,869
Sit down and talk.

800
01:10:56,743 --> 01:10:57,472
What did you say?

801
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:28,810
Minibus DW9363,
stop and park to the side.

802
01:11:55,566 --> 01:11:57,648
Turn off you radio and engine.

803
01:12:01,813 --> 01:12:02,749
What's the matter, sir?

804
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:04,310
You're asking me what's the matter?
You just ran a red light.

805
01:12:04,311 --> 01:12:05,560
No, l didn't run the red light.

806
01:12:05,561 --> 01:12:08,371
No? Everyone in the EU car saw it.

807
01:12:08,372 --> 01:12:09,725
Let me see your license
and l.D. Card.

808
01:12:20,345 --> 01:12:21,489
l'm giving you a ticket
for running the red light.

809
01:12:21,490 --> 01:12:22,531
License, ticket.

810
01:12:23,676 --> 01:12:26,071
Keep your radio down, goon.

811
01:12:28,882 --> 01:12:30,755
Bastard!
Giving tickets for no reason.

812
01:12:30,756 --> 01:12:32,942
Damn it! Bustard.

813
01:13:12,504 --> 01:13:14,586
Everybody off!

814
01:13:23,540 --> 01:13:25,206
The borsh soup and fish filet please.

815
01:13:26,559 --> 01:13:27,496
Coffee!

816
01:13:28,641 --> 01:13:29,995
Don't you want to eat?

817
01:13:37,803 --> 01:13:38,948
What's your name?

818
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,050
Leung Yuen-ting!

819
01:13:49,463 --> 01:13:51,024
There's no use in knowing my name.

820
01:13:51,025 --> 01:13:53,420
l read the paper, l know who you are.

821
01:13:54,044 --> 01:13:54,877
Thank you!

822
01:13:55,190 --> 01:13:56,335
You're welcome!

823
01:13:57,896 --> 01:13:59,042
lt's a shame l have no time.

824
01:14:00,499 --> 01:14:01,749
Why does time matter?

825
01:14:24,653 --> 01:14:25,902
Sorry...

826
01:14:43,289 --> 01:14:44,537
- Boss!
- How is it?

827
01:14:44,538 --> 01:14:45,788
Don't worry, we've checked it.

828
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:47,245
Nothing's wrong in there.

829
01:14:47,557 --> 01:14:48,597
Keep an eye on all the exits.

830
01:14:48,599 --> 01:14:49,534
When the stuff arrives,

831
01:14:49,536 --> 01:14:50,680
no one is allowed to leave.

832
01:14:50,681 --> 01:14:51,514
Yes!

833
01:14:59,218 --> 01:15:00,467
Calling Officer Wong,
target's appeared.

834
01:15:06,714 --> 01:15:08,900
l'm sorry...

835
01:15:14,834 --> 01:15:17,958
You...

836
01:16:11,991 --> 01:16:13,032
How are you?

837
01:16:13,865 --> 01:16:16,260
What a crowd,
even Wong Kai-fat is here.

838
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:17,717
You bastard!

839
01:16:18,030 --> 01:16:19,071
Take a seat!

840
01:16:20,841 --> 01:16:21,882
Who's this woman?

841
01:16:26,359 --> 01:16:28,753
Go tell him that Peter sent you.

842
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:31,772
lf the bald guy has any problems.

843
01:16:32,397 --> 01:16:34,063
Tell him the diamond's fake.

844
01:16:36,770 --> 01:16:39,685
But before you go,
at least give me a kiss.

845
01:16:49,992 --> 01:16:50,929
Thank you!

846
01:17:00,091 --> 01:17:01,028
Get ready.

847
01:17:02,902 --> 01:17:03,943
How are you?

848
01:17:05,713 --> 01:17:06,962
Why aren't you playing?

849
01:17:11,855 --> 01:17:13,729
Peter asked me to make the deal.

850
01:17:33,302 --> 01:17:34,135
Move!

851
01:17:35,176 --> 01:17:36,113
Hold on a second...

852
01:17:36,529 --> 01:17:37,778
Open it!

853
01:17:37,779 --> 01:17:39,131
Sorry, Officer Ho said...

854
01:17:39,132 --> 01:17:41,005
We should move
when the bald guy takes it.

855
01:17:41,006 --> 01:17:41,734
Are you clear?

856
01:17:41,735 --> 01:17:43,193
Damn it1 Damn you fag!

857
01:17:59,954 --> 01:18:01,100
Are you trying to rob me, pal?

858
01:18:02,037 --> 01:18:02,870
Where's the money?

859
01:18:04,015 --> 01:18:05,575
How do l know the stuff
is real or not?

860
01:18:05,576 --> 01:18:07,659
lf you pay me, then l'll show you
the real stuff.

861
01:18:10,678 --> 01:18:11,511
ls she your girlfriend?

862
01:18:15,571 --> 01:18:16,819
Yes!

863
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:19,318
You stay. Your girlfriend
will get the money.

864
01:18:19,319 --> 01:18:20,255
ls he going to get the money?

865
01:18:20,256 --> 01:18:21,089
Yes!

866
01:18:34,415 --> 01:18:37,538
Honey, he said he'd take you
to get the money.

867
01:18:40,662 --> 01:18:41,703
Be careful!

868
01:18:50,032 --> 01:18:50,969
Follow the girl.

869
01:18:52,010 --> 01:18:52,947
Hung, do you read me?

870
01:19:59,266 --> 01:20:00,307
Send someone to check it out.

871
01:20:00,931 --> 01:20:03,430
Copy, l'll be right here.

872
01:20:03,742 --> 01:20:04,678
Keep an eye on this place.

873
01:20:04,679 --> 01:20:05,408
Clear!

874
01:20:11,447 --> 01:20:12,696
Cheung, watch out.

875
01:20:13,216 --> 01:20:13,944
Calling Hung...

876
01:20:13,945 --> 01:20:15,299
- Go over and take a look.
- Yes, sir.

877
01:20:25,293 --> 01:20:28,625
- Chung, what's the matter?
- Hung, what's the matter?

878
01:20:32,373 --> 01:20:35,496
- Chung, what the hell happened?
- Hung, what's happened?

879
01:20:37,995 --> 01:20:38,932
Go over there?

880
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:53,611
Don't worry, the stuff is here.

881
01:20:54,444 --> 01:20:56,631
lf you don't believe me,
you go get it first!

882
01:20:59,233 --> 01:21:00,065
Attention!

883
01:21:00,066 --> 01:21:01,106
Wait...

884
01:21:01,107 --> 01:21:03,190
They're the robbers,
keep an eye on them.

885
01:21:03,502 --> 01:21:05,584
Mr. Chen, Peter told me to come
and make the deal.

886
01:21:09,957 --> 01:21:11,519
Kid, what the hell
are you trying to do?

887
01:21:12,351 --> 01:21:14,954
That stuff is fake,
the real stuff is here.

888
01:21:17,557 --> 01:21:18,702
You are so stupid,

889
01:21:19,327 --> 01:21:20,889
you don't even know
what game you are playing.

890
01:21:21,409 --> 01:21:22,867
Stop thinking that girl
still likes you.

891
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:25,990
She is fooling you, stupid!
Your stuff is fake.

892
01:21:28,176 --> 01:21:29,426
No one ever tricks me!

893
01:21:32,757 --> 01:21:33,902
l'll let you take a look.

894
01:21:48,061 --> 01:21:49,311
ls it real or fake?

895
01:21:55,766 --> 01:21:56,703
What happened?

896
01:21:57,431 --> 01:21:58,681
Do you want to see the real one?

897
01:22:00,138 --> 01:22:01,596
Damn it! You're working with her.

898
01:22:03,158 --> 01:22:04,303
Let go...

899
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:07,426
lt's mine...

900
01:22:07,738 --> 01:22:09,612
Don't move...

901
01:22:10,133 --> 01:22:11,591
Before you give the stuff to
the bald guy, don't move!

902
01:22:28,248 --> 01:22:29,498
Mr. Wong, Hung has been knocked out.

903
01:22:30,955 --> 01:22:31,788
Boss!

904
01:22:32,413 --> 01:22:34,807
They're unconscious
and the money's gone.

905
01:22:40,637 --> 01:22:42,824
You...

906
01:22:50,944 --> 01:22:51,777
Attention!

907
01:22:54,172 --> 01:22:55,628
A man dressed up like a woman and
another one's messing around here.

908
01:22:55,629 --> 01:22:57,087
Try to trick me with a bowling ball?
Do you think l'm stupid?

909
01:22:57,399 --> 01:22:58,440
Bowling ball?

910
01:23:04,583 --> 01:23:05,519
Police, don't move!

911
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:08,642
Put down your gun...
Let me see your hands...

912
01:23:08,643 --> 01:23:09,579
Police, freeze!

913
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:11,037
Freeze...

914
01:23:11,038 --> 01:23:12,390
Drop your gun!

915
01:23:12,391 --> 01:23:15,515
Right! l am Chief lnspector Wong
from the Organized Crime Bureau.

916
01:23:15,931 --> 01:23:17,701
Now we get both the thieves
and the stolen stuff.

917
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:20,094
l have reason to suspect...

918
01:23:20,096 --> 01:23:22,178
That these diamonds are the stolen
goods from the financial company.

919
01:23:23,323 --> 01:23:25,718
Everyone put your hands on your head
and get on your knees!

920
01:24:17,357 --> 01:24:18,189
Get in the car!

921
01:24:33,286 --> 01:24:34,639
Did l pick the wrong person?

922
01:24:36,513 --> 01:24:39,532
lf l take you back to the station,
l win.

923
01:24:40,469 --> 01:24:41,510
Of course!

924
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:48,798
We are friends, right?

925
01:25:00,042 --> 01:25:01,499
Do you think we are still friends?

926
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:03,894
You have to match out for others
all the time.

927
01:25:05,248 --> 01:25:06,704
lt will take less than 5 minutes
from here to the station.

928
01:25:06,705 --> 01:25:07,850
Take that turn and the station
is right there.

929
01:25:08,163 --> 01:25:09,516
Even a blind man knows
how to get there.

930
01:25:32,733 --> 01:25:34,399
Let's see where you can run to!

931
01:25:44,497 --> 01:25:46,580
Here we are, can you move now?

932
01:25:47,517 --> 01:25:48,870
l've done everything
l am supposed to do.

933
01:25:49,182 --> 01:25:50,224
Not me!

934
01:25:50,952 --> 01:25:52,721
lf l don't take you
back to the station tonight.

935
01:25:52,722 --> 01:25:54,284
l'll be sorry
for the rest of my life.

936
01:25:55,117 --> 01:25:57,094
Then you'll remember me forever.

937
01:25:57,095 --> 01:25:59,177
Don't worry!
l will always remember you.

938
01:26:10,421 --> 01:26:11,774
l'm sorry!

939
01:26:20,936 --> 01:26:22,706
No way? This game again?

940
01:26:23,123 --> 01:26:23,955
lt's real!

941
01:26:25,829 --> 01:26:26,871
You don't believe me?

942
01:26:29,577 --> 01:26:30,827
lf you don't believe me,
then push it yourself.

943
01:26:37,594 --> 01:26:39,259
You're not kidding this time?

944
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:40,405
You pressed it.

945
01:26:43,424 --> 01:26:44,569
Everyone, don't get too close.

946
01:26:44,882 --> 01:26:45,819
There's a bomb in the car.

947
01:26:46,860 --> 01:26:47,797
Bomb?

948
01:26:48,317 --> 01:26:49,567
Don't get too close.

949
01:26:50,296 --> 01:26:51,128
Are you scared?

950
01:26:54,772 --> 01:26:55,709
No, l'm not!

951
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:01,226
How am l going to die?
Where l am going to die?

952
01:27:01,227 --> 01:27:02,685
All of that doesn't matter
to me anymore.

953
01:27:04,142 --> 01:27:05,392
The most important thing is...

954
01:27:06,745 --> 01:27:08,203
That l don't die in a police station.

955
01:27:48,077 --> 01:27:49,326
Don't get any closer, stop the car!

956
01:27:53,179 --> 01:27:55,051
Everyone listen.

957
01:27:55,053 --> 01:27:56,406
l am Chief lnspector Wong.

958
01:27:56,718 --> 01:27:59,112
The suspect has a bomb in the car
which will go off any minute.

959
01:27:59,113 --> 01:28:01,091
Everyone, be careful! Take cover!

960
01:28:29,409 --> 01:28:30,658
- Go after him!
- Yes, Sir!

961
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:34,302
- There's a bomb in the car.
- Stop!

962
01:28:38,675 --> 01:28:39,716
Why did you let him go?

963
01:28:40,133 --> 01:28:41,901
He said there was a bomb in the car.

964
01:28:41,902 --> 01:28:42,839
Bomb?

965
01:28:43,256 --> 01:28:44,608
Why do you...

966
01:28:44,609 --> 01:28:46,378
Trust him now?

967
01:28:46,379 --> 01:28:47,837
He tricked you, stupid!

968
01:28:48,774 --> 01:28:49,711
Where are you going?

969
01:28:50,752 --> 01:28:51,689
l'm hungry.

970
01:29:11,782 --> 01:29:13,655
''A unknown man made a donation
in the name of Ho Sheung-sang''

971
01:29:13,656 --> 01:29:16,259
''A donation of 30 millions
for the Children's Cancer Fund''

972
01:30:08,210 --> 01:30:09,564
Sorry! Miss, l got the wrong person.

973
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,498
That diamond looks very pretty,
where did you buy it?

974
01:30:16,539 --> 01:30:18,204
A friend gave it to me, it's cheap.

975
01:30:18,205 --> 01:30:19,142
Let me see.

976
01:30:25,805 --> 01:30:26,846
Your boyfriend gave it to you?

977
01:30:27,783 --> 01:30:28,824
Haven't seen him for a long time.

978
01:30:30,802 --> 01:30:32,989
Why? You guys fighting?

979
01:30:34,655 --> 01:30:38,403
l don't know! l haven't seen him
since he gave me the diamond.

980
01:30:40,797 --> 01:30:42,046
He's got great taste.

981
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:45,690
Even though it's fake,
it looks real to me.

982
01:30:46,731 --> 01:30:47,773
You should take good care of it.

983
01:30:48,710 --> 01:30:50,479
May be he'll suddenly
show up again...

984
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,666
And surprise you!
