1
00:02:02,657 --> 00:02:04,340
I know I should know this, darling,

2
00:02:04,455 --> 00:02:06,332
but are you mad at me?

3
00:02:06,455 --> 00:02:08,821
Baby. Holly!

4
00:02:10,377 --> 00:02:13,540
I did something, right?
I did something bad, right?

5
00:02:14,331 --> 00:02:15,662
Should I know what it is?

6
00:02:18,252 --> 00:02:20,664
Or is it something maybe
you just think I did?

7
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,774
No, no. Idid it. Idid it.

8
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:31,299
It was a bad, bad thing I did,
and I¡¯m so sorry, Ion.

9
00:02:31,814 --> 00:02:35,102
Holly, come on, will you? Holly, wait.

10
00:02:35,486 --> 00:02:40,185
Baby, you have to let me in on it.

11
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:45,022
Or are you waiting until were
in the apartment before you talk to me?

12
00:02:46,814 --> 00:02:48,486
ke you gonna make me sleep
in the bathtub again?

13
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:55,308
Oh, no, I don¡¯t know what I said.

14
00:02:55,406 --> 00:02:57,454
You said it. You know you said it.

15
00:02:57,531 --> 00:02:59,487
No, I don¡¯t know what I said,
but I didn¡¯t mean it.

16
00:02:59,577 --> 00:03:01,408
Yes, you did. You mean everything you say.

17
00:03:01,578 --> 00:03:03,534
Oh, sometimes I mean nothing
when I say something.

18
00:03:03,686 --> 00:03:05,734
Something is never nothing.
It¡¯s always something.

19
00:03:05,773 --> 00:03:08,253
Well, most 0f what I say is nothing.
It¡¯s just something to say.

20
00:03:08,374 --> 00:03:12,094
No, men say it¡¯s just something to say
in order to get away with saying something,

21
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:14,101
but they know they¡¯re saying something
every time they say it.

22
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:15,413
Say what? What did I say?

23
00:03:15,453 --> 00:03:16,590
You said, at my mothers tonight,

24
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:18,463
you would have a baby,
but that I¡¯m not ready.

25
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,660
To my mother!

26
00:03:19,861 --> 00:03:21,488
You might as well have said Em a lesbian.

27
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:23,226
Well, lam the only man you ever had.

28
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,304
Oh, I dated Timmy Harrison for your months
before I met you.

29
00:03:27,411 --> 00:03:28,230
Isnt he a woman now?

30
00:03:29,896 --> 00:03:31,944
You told my mother I didnt want children!

31
00:03:32,022 --> 00:03:35,025
¡ª I did not. I didnt say that.
¡ª Yes, you did. Yes, you did.

32
00:03:35,059 --> 00:03:36,310
¡ª You said exactly that.
¡ªIdid not.

33
00:03:36,534 --> 00:03:40,903
I didnt say that you werent ready to
have a baby. I said that you wanted to wait.

34
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,336
Which means I dont want one right now.

35
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:45,138
¡ª Right.
¡ª Thank you.

36
00:03:45,332 --> 00:03:46,492
Wait a minute. Tm confused.

37
00:03:46,581 --> 00:03:48,025
Can I get a ruling on this? Anybody?

38
00:03:48,097 --> 00:03:49,894
No, you¡¯re not confused. You¡¯re just wrong.

39
00:03:50,018 --> 00:03:51,667
¡®Holly doesn¡¯t wanna have a baby.¡±

40
00:03:51,737 --> 00:03:53,341
We had a plan, Gerry.

41
00:03:53,488 --> 00:03:55,900
To wait to have children
until we could buy an apartment,

42
00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:59,136
put 25 percent of each paycheck
into a separate joint account

43
00:03:59,222 --> 00:04:01,019
with a six and a quarter interest
for foe years.

44
00:04:01,128 --> 00:04:02,129
Why didnt you tell my mother that?

45
00:04:03,738 --> 00:04:07,981
Each paycheck? Darling, you only
just started getting regular paychecks.

46
00:04:08,254 --> 00:04:10,415
You¡¯ve quit five jobs
in two years, remember?

47
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:12,468
Well, I can¡¯t work for idiots.

48
00:04:12,497 --> 00:04:15,102
¡ª They can¡¯t all be idiots.
¡ª Yes, they can.

49
00:04:15,175 --> 00:04:16,585
They can all be idiots.

50
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,692
Md why didnt you tell my mother

51
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:21,867
about the business loan
you and John took out without asking me?

52
00:04:23,768 --> 00:04:25,770
You see, you finally said it.

53
00:04:25,892 --> 00:04:27,894
¡ª I knew that¡¯s why you¡¯re angry.
¡ª That¡¯s not the reason I¡¯m angry.

54
00:04:27,969 --> 00:04:30,051
¡ª No, it is not the reason that I¡¯m angry.
¡ª Oh, yes it is the reason you¡¯re angry.

55
00:04:30,093 --> 00:04:31,822
I just think that we should have waited.
Why couldnt have you waited?

56
00:04:31,937 --> 00:04:33,666
Waited for what? What are you talking about?
Waiting for what?

57
00:04:33,766 --> 00:04:35,939
I¡¯ve been driving limos
for four years, Holly.

58
00:04:36,405 --> 00:04:38,305
So John and me, we wanna start a business.

59
00:04:38,405 --> 00:04:42,580
We buy a few cars, we get a few clients.
That¡¯s a career right there.

60
00:04:42,687 --> 00:04:43,893
What is your problem?

61
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,621
Md what if it doesn¡¯t work out?
What if we always have to live here?

62
00:04:46,688 --> 00:04:49,589
Md what about what I want, huh?

63
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,180
You think I wanna be a real estate agent

64
00:04:52,253 --> 00:04:54,460
showing other people apartments to buy
that I can never live in?

65
00:04:54,581 --> 00:04:56,981
There may be things I wanna do with my life.

66
00:04:57,175 --> 00:05:00,338
¡ª Okay. Like what?
¡ª I dont know. Other things.

67
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,665
Then quit, all right?

68
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:05,819
I mean, the job makes
you cranky at home every bloody day anyway.

69
00:05:06,299 --> 00:05:08,335
You wanna have a baby? Lets do it.

70
00:05:08,407 --> 00:05:11,456
¡ª See? I hate when you do that.
¡ª Do what?

71
00:05:11,531 --> 00:05:13,226
¡®Lets have a baby.¡¯ La Ia Ia.

72
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:15,308
In a five¡ªfloor walk up, we can barely move

73
00:05:15,376 --> 00:05:17,230
and I¡¯d have to change diapers
on the windowsill.

74
00:05:17,376 --> 00:05:18,456
You have to have a plan.

75
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:21,614
You cant act like everything
just gonna work out by itself, Gerry.

76
00:05:21,736 --> 00:05:24,455
Why do I haoe to be the responsible grown¡ªup
who worries?

77
00:05:25,096 --> 00:05:28,748
Why can¡¯t I be the cute, carefree Irish guy
who sings all the time?

78
00:05:28,894 --> 00:05:30,896
Because you can¡¯t sing
without making dogs bark.

79
00:05:33,049 --> 00:05:37,657
Look, Holly, people have babies
with no money all the time.

80
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:41,339
Md if you¡¯re so worried about it,
why don¡¯t you stop buying designer clothes?

81
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:43,534
I buy evething on eBay.

82
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:45,659
It doesn¡¯t count when you¡¯re wearing
Marc Jacobs from Minneapolis.

83
00:05:50,018 --> 00:05:53,613
Do you want to have a baby?

84
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:57,098
-Do you?
-Yes, I do.

85
00:05:57,737 --> 00:06:00,103
-See?
¡ªSee what?

86
00:06:00,137 --> 00:06:01,980
I know what you¡¯re really saying
even when you don¡¯t say it, Gerry.

87
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:04,658
Oh, yeah.
You mean the two conversations thing.

88
00:06:04,768 --> 00:06:05,700
The one we¡¯re having

89
00:06:05,815 --> 00:06:07,100
and the one you think we¡¯re having.

90
00:06:07,253 --> 00:06:10,893
You said that to my mother because you¡¯re
mad at me for not wanting children yet

91
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:13,055
and because Tm no fun anymore

92
00:06:13,176 --> 00:06:17,340
and because we dont have enough
hot, nasty sex

93
00:06:17,487 --> 00:06:18,772
because I¡¯m always bitching about bills.

94
00:06:18,894 --> 00:06:20,384
That¡¯s what you¡¯re really saying, isn¡¯t it?

95
00:06:20,534 --> 00:06:23,389
Why dont you just be honest and say it?
Say what you mean.

96
00:06:25,411 --> 00:06:26,821
WI right.

97
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:31,184
I wish we had more hot, nasty sex.

98
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,487
Or the other kind is fine.

99
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,591
What you¡¯re really saying is
this isn¡¯t the life you wanted, is it?

100
00:06:39,581 --> 00:06:42,903
Well, that¡¯s not what I¡¯m saying.
Is that what you¡¯re saying?

101
00:06:42,972 --> 00:06:47,056
Md what if this is it, Gerry?
What if this is all there is to our life?

102
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,947
¡ª What do you mean?
¡ª It means this is it.

103
00:06:49,251 --> 00:06:51,105
Were a married couple
who own a limo company,

104
00:06:51,221 --> 00:06:53,496
who may or may not have children,
end of story.

105
00:06:54,298 --> 00:06:56,380
¡ª Well, what other story do you want?
¡ªIdont know.

106
00:06:56,455 --> 00:06:58,503
What do you want, Hol? What?

107
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:01,259
Because Tm tired
of trying to figure it out.

108
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:04,742
You went a bigger apartment?
III take a second job.

109
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,408
You want a child,
you don¡¯t want a child. What?

110
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,332
I know what I want

111
00:07:10,453 --> 00:07:12,660
because I have it in my hands right now.

112
00:07:13,095 --> 00:07:16,019
Do you? Do you know what you want?

113
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:19,457
Because you better tell me now
if Em not it.

114
00:07:20,859 --> 00:07:23,384
Or whet? You gonna leave?

115
00:07:23,415 --> 00:07:24,302
Why, you want me to leave?

116
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,502
I want you to leave if you wanna leave.
Don¡¯t use me as an excuse.

117
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:27,898
Ill leave if you want me to leave.

118
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:29,816
Then leave if you wanna go. Go ahead, leave!

119
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,975
Don¡¯t push me, Holly!

120
00:07:31,048 --> 00:07:34,051
¡ª You wanna leave, just say goodbye.
¡ª Oh, that¡¯s me bollocks!

121
00:07:34,172 --> 00:07:36,766
¡ª Stop acting bilingual.
¡ª Oh, kiss me arse.

122
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:39,177
Kiss mine in English.

123
00:08:00,216 --> 00:08:03,663
ke we finished now, luv? Can I come beck?

124
00:08:05,373 --> 00:08:06,328
Yeah.

125
00:08:07,607 --> 00:08:08,665
Tm sorry.

126
00:08:09,654 --> 00:08:10,769
Tm sorry.

127
00:08:15,219 --> 00:08:16,971
¡ª Tm sorry, luv.
¡ª It¡¯s all right.

128
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:23,223
I¡¯m sorry.
I said the wrong thing to your mother.

129
00:08:24,223 --> 00:08:26,384
God, I still get nervous around her.

130
00:08:26,895 --> 00:08:29,511
I still think after nine years,
she doesn¡¯t like me.

131
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,666
I know I¡¯m being stupid.

132
00:08:31,702 --> 00:08:35,866
No, you¡¯re not being stupid, baby.
She doesn¡¯t like you.

133
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:40,417
Really? And I thought deep down,
she really loved me.

134
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:44,458
No, she doesn¡¯t.
I was 19 when we got married.

135
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:48,660
Md you corrupted me with sex and charm

136
00:08:49,049 --> 00:08:50,744
and the longer it takes you
to make yxur fortune,

137
00:08:50,814 --> 00:08:53,260
the less sexy and charming you are, honey.

138
00:08:54,658 --> 00:08:57,138
What? What are you looking for?

139
00:08:57,455 --> 00:09:00,743
Me balls.
They were hanging there a minute ago.

140
00:09:01,581 --> 00:09:06,587
My mother said it was a mistake manying you
because I loved you too much.

141
00:09:07,252 --> 00:09:09,026
It wont last.

142
00:09:09,126 --> 00:09:11,458
I dont wanna make any mistakes, Gerry.

143
00:09:13,609 --> 00:09:17,409
Well, you¡¯re in the wrong species, luv.
Be a duck.

144
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,414
My baby.

145
00:09:23,969 --> 00:09:28,053
We¡¯re not a mistake
just because we don¡¯t have any money.

146
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,332
Md we are gonna last.

147
00:09:32,377 --> 00:09:34,060
You know howl know?

148
00:09:36,252 --> 00:09:39,301
Because I still wake up every morning

149
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:43,743
and the first thing I want to do
is see your face.

150
00:09:46,613 --> 00:09:47,944
Oh, I¡¯m sorry.

151
00:09:49,612 --> 00:09:53,332
I see people buying bigger apartments
and having babies.

152
00:09:54,252 --> 00:09:57,380
I get so afraid sometimes
that our lifes never gonna start.

153
00:09:58,454 --> 00:09:59,512
Baby.

154
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:06,949
Were already in our life.
Its already started. This is it.

155
00:10:07,861 --> 00:10:09,863
You have to stop waiting, baby.

156
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:14,869
Md Hal, you can¡¯t keep eating me head off,
telling me to leave.

157
00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:18,611
I¡¯m not going anywhere.

158
00:10:23,812 --> 00:10:29,023
I¡¯m not your dad
or don¡¯t you know that yet?

159
00:10:35,531 --> 00:10:38,375
I should get my shoes.
They¡¯re all over the place.

160
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,058
They¡¯re gonna think I don¡¯t love them.

161
00:11:32,764 --> 00:11:35,688
Shake it, baby. Do the stomach shake.

162
00:11:46,045 --> 00:11:48,172
My eye. I¡¯m blind.

163
00:11:48,327 --> 00:11:51,945
Oh, I just wanna lick
your little Glaswegian chocolate.

164
00:11:52,092 --> 00:11:55,971
Okay, okay. I can¡¯t believe
I¡¯m in love with a leprechaun.

165
00:11:59,451 --> 00:12:01,100
Oh, wait. The light.

166
00:12:01,132 --> 00:12:02,451
¡ª You were up last.
¡ª What? No.

167
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,976
¡ª You were up last.
¡ª But I¡¯m not up now, am I?

168
00:12:05,046 --> 00:12:07,617
Baby, look at, I¡¯m injured. Ow, me eye.

169
00:12:08,047 --> 00:12:10,504
¡ª God. A pain in me hole.
¡ª Oh, that¡¯s a good girl.

170
00:12:12,297 --> 00:12:15,255
Oh, come get back to bed
or Ill start without you.

171
00:12:19,499 --> 00:12:20,614
¡ªShit.
-You okay?

172
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:22,974
Shit, no! My toe!

173
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:27,977
I tell you what. Someone should get a light
on that side of the bed. That¡¯s ridiculous.

174
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,863
¡ª Ill get my nest husband to do it.
¡ª Oh, come here.

175
00:12:34,859 --> 00:12:38,226
Nest husband. Next husband. Come here, you.

176
00:12:43,531 --> 00:12:45,579
Tm sorry I lose my mind sometimes.

177
00:12:45,969 --> 00:12:47,505
Did it hurt you? Let me look.

178
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,407
Will you shut up and kiss me, okay?

179
00:12:53,971 --> 00:12:56,132
Crazy bitch. Pain in me hole.

180
00:14:20,328 --> 00:14:23,252
Oh, Daniel,
we forgot those Thanksgiving decorations.

181
00:14:23,374 --> 00:14:25,171
¡ª Will you take them down, please?
¡ª Sure, Mrs. Reilly.

182
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:26,946
¡ª Where do you want me to put them?
¡ª Patricia.

183
00:14:27,092 --> 00:14:29,663
In the skinny closet. Have you got the key?

184
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,095
No, I don¡¯t.

185
00:14:32,047 --> 00:14:33,821
Well, I¡¯ll make you a set next week.

186
00:14:34,376 --> 00:14:37,504
Oh, and ask Gerry¡¯s drivers
to close the curtains, will you?

187
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:38,407
Sure.

188
00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:50,534
¡ª Oh, John.
¡ª Oh, Denise.

189
00:14:51,014 --> 00:14:53,050
¡ª Hi.
¡ª Oh, it¡¯s good to see you.

190
00:14:53,295 --> 00:14:54,250
Do Ihsve to help?

191
00:14:54,404 --> 00:14:55,814
¡ª No, you do not have to help.
-Good.

192
00:14:56,014 --> 00:14:57,333
Sharon, you look great.

193
00:14:57,969 --> 00:15:00,017
¡ª Oh, this is good.
-So do you.

194
00:15:00,171 --> 00:15:01,615
¡ªAmllate?
¡ª No. This is gorgeoos.

195
00:15:01,656 --> 00:15:02,896
Oh, wait till you see Gerry.

196
00:15:03,048 --> 00:15:04,504
¡ª You¡¯re gonna die.
¡ª Oh, yeah?

197
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,509
Well, as Gerry would say,
¡®Lets get this party started.¡¯

198
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,532
Gerry Kennedy, did not want a lot of words.

199
00:15:39,686 --> 00:15:41,415
He preferred music.

200
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,224
He was a unique young man

201
00:15:44,608 --> 00:15:49,409
as you can see by the urn he had
designed by the love 0f his life,

202
00:15:49,606 --> 00:15:51,688
his wife Holly.

203
00:15:51,888 --> 00:15:56,530
His life may be over for now,
but we can still hear it.

204
00:15:57,372 --> 00:16:03,538
He lives in us forever, in our hearts,
like his favorite song.

205
00:16:12,891 --> 00:16:17,260
Got a lucky one

206
00:16:17,453 --> 00:16:21,457
Came in 18 to one

207
00:16:21,687 --> 00:16:25,259
Joe got a feeling

208
00:16:26,048 --> 00:16:28,539
This years for me and you

209
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,095
So Happy Christmas

210
00:16:35,047 --> 00:16:38,255
I love you, baby

211
00:16:38,969 --> 00:16:42,018
I can see a better time

212
00:16:43,219 --> 00:16:47,610
When all our dreams come true

213
00:16:59,762 --> 00:17:01,013
Youre a bum, youre a punk

214
00:17:01,137 --> 00:17:02,616
Youre an old slut on junk

215
00:17:02,683 --> 00:17:05,527
Lying there almost dead
on a drip in that bed

216
00:17:05,653 --> 00:17:08,531
You scumbag, you maggot
You cheap, lousy faggot

217
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,257
Happy Christmas your arse

218
00:17:10,326 --> 00:17:11,736
I pray God its our last

219
00:17:11,857 --> 00:17:17,409
The boys of the N.Y.P.D. choir
Still singing ¡®Galway Bay

220
00:17:17,576 --> 00:17:21,865
Md the bells are ringing out
For Christmas Day

221
00:17:28,374 --> 00:17:30,023
Mom! How you doing?

222
00:17:31,403 --> 00:17:34,133
¡ª Ciara.
¡ª Sis, good to see you.

223
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,024
Oh, good to hold you.

224
00:17:40,654 --> 00:17:42,053
Hello, Gerry.

225
00:18:00,926 --> 00:18:02,575
¡ª Hi, I¡¯m Denise.
¡ª Malt

226
00:18:03,209 --> 00:18:04,983
¡ªhove your tie.
¡ª Oh, thanks.

227
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,257
¡ª Are you single, Matt?
-Yes.

228
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,651
¡ª Are you gay?
-Yes.

229
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:10,826
Okay.

230
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:15,140
Did Holly call his parents?
Why aren¡¯t they here?

231
00:18:15,335 --> 00:18:17,371
I did, spoke to the mother.

232
00:18:17,459 --> 00:18:20,576
His father¡¯s just had another operation.
He¡¯s not sopposed to travel.

233
00:18:21,411 --> 00:18:22,855
So, why didn¡¯t she come alone?

234
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:26,575
I mean, it¡¯s Ireland, it¡¯s not Japan.
He was their only son.

235
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,732
Dont ask me.

236
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:34,490
¡ª Hi!
¡ª Hi.

237
00:18:34,723 --> 00:18:37,100

¡ªThanks.

238
00:18:37,175 --> 00:18:38,858
-Denise.

239
00:18:39,893 --> 00:18:42,259
¡ª Are you single?
-Yes.

240
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,544
¡ª Are you gay?
¡ª No.

241
00:18:45,098 --> 00:18:46,577
¡ª Are you working?
¡ª No.

242
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:58,578
¡ª You make a ravishing widow, sis.
¡ªThanks.

243
00:19:00,103 --> 00:19:01,934
I¡¯m so glad you¡¯re here,

244
00:19:02,103 --> 00:19:04,264
but it¡¯s so far. I would¡¯ve understood.

245
00:19:04,335 --> 00:19:06,257
No, I¡¯m done with Australia.

246
00:19:06,364 --> 00:19:08,412
Besides, Gerry wrote me. I had to.

247
00:19:08,974 --> 00:19:10,293
He wrote you?

248
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:13,005
Yeah, a couple 0f months ago.
Probably because of Mom.

249
00:19:13,489 --> 00:19:15,935
He knew id have a ton 0f melodrama
or her to play with

250
00:19:16,005 --> 00:19:17,779
while you pull yooroelf together.

251
00:19:19,488 --> 00:19:21,012
Can I get you anything?

252
00:19:25,412 --> 00:19:28,063
¡ª Sorry about your loss.
¡ªThanks.

253
00:19:28,818 --> 00:19:30,547
How did he die?

254
00:19:31,647 --> 00:19:33,695
¡ª A brain tumor.
¡ª Nice!

255
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,770
So thats a great looking urn.

256
00:19:41,411 --> 00:19:43,367
I wish I were that creative.

257
00:19:44,256 --> 00:19:47,214
I buried my dog in a stereo box.

258
00:19:50,364 --> 00:19:51,649
Its not the same.

259
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:01,775
¡ª I love your suit.
¡ªThanks.

260
00:20:02,132 --> 00:20:03,861
¡ª Are you single?
-Yes!

261
00:20:03,977 --> 00:20:05,547
¡ª Are you gay?
¡ª No.

262
00:20:05,693 --> 00:20:07,775
¡ª Are you working?
-Yes.

263
00:20:08,055 --> 00:20:09,909
-Denise.
-Sam.

264
00:20:22,413 --> 00:20:23,334
Thank you.

265
00:20:23,772 --> 00:20:25,421
Okay. Okay.

266
00:20:27,928 --> 00:20:29,008
PJI right.

267
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:33,778
When Gerry and I went to a bank
to apply for a business loan,

268
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,135
I was a little nervous.

269
00:20:35,257 --> 00:20:36,007
Gerry told me,

270
00:20:36,257 --> 00:20:39,624
¡®Relax, these people are never
gonna give us the money anryxay,

271
00:20:39,726 --> 00:20:41,057
so we might as well have some fun.¡¯

272
00:20:43,897 --> 00:20:44,750
No, don¡¯t clean.

273
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:48,104
No, I have to do something.
I can¡¯t talk anymore.

274
00:20:49,645 --> 00:20:51,567
Wanna stay with us a few days
while your sister¡¯s here?

275
00:20:51,646 --> 00:20:54,695
No. I think...

276
00:20:55,769 --> 00:20:59,182
You know, I guess I should be home.

277
00:20:59,893 --> 00:21:03,852
I think I need to be...home.

278
00:21:03,892 --> 00:21:07,009
Well, this is your home too, you know.

279
00:21:08,846 --> 00:21:13,613
But that¡¯s good. Get back on your feet.
That¡¯s a good thing.

280
00:22:35,459 --> 00:22:37,290
Hey, it¡¯s Geny. Rent a Gaiway Limo.

281
00:22:37,412 --> 00:22:38,618
Leave a message.

282
00:22:45,003 --> 00:22:46,777

00:22:57,818 --> 00:22:59,615
Hey, it¡¯s Gerry. Rent a Gaiway Limo.

00:22:59,693 --> 00:23:01,058
Leave a message.

286
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,821
Holly? Its Mom. Are you all right?

287
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:23,131
ke you showering? Dont make me worry.

288
00:23:23,204 --> 00:23:24,819
Tm worried. Youre not calling me back.
Please call.

289
00:23:24,923 --> 00:23:27,130
I know it¡¯s hard, honey,
but don¡¯t lock yourself in.

290
00:23:27,251 --> 00:23:30,175
It¡¯s been over a week. I¡¯m here, okay?

291
00:23:30,252 --> 00:23:32,106
Hey, it¡¯s Denise.
Listen, I buzzed your apartment.

292
00:23:32,488 --> 00:23:34,740
Nobody¡¯s heard from yoo. Where are yoo?

293
00:23:34,847 --> 00:23:37,099
PJl right, call somebody. I love you.

294
00:23:37,176 --> 00:23:39,849
Ill make him live. I will.

295
00:23:39,974 --> 00:23:41,703
Whatever you might do, I can do more

296
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,568
because I know how to fight better than you.

297
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:47,262
Why can¡¯t I be Bette Davis?

298
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:53,011
WI right. I mean, the job makes you cranky
at home every bloody day, anryoay.

299
00:23:53,175 --> 00:23:55,097
You wanna have a baby? Lets do it.

300
00:23:55,138 --> 00:23:58,335
¡ª See? I hate when you do that.
¡ª Do what?

301
00:23:58,456 --> 00:24:00,105
¡®Lets have a baby.¡¯ La Ia Ia.

302
00:24:00,206 --> 00:24:02,208
In a five¡ªfloor walk up, we can barely move

303
00:24:02,284 --> 00:24:05,333
You cant act like everything
just gonna work out by itself, Gerry.

304
00:24:05,456 --> 00:24:08,414
Why do I haoe to be the responsible grown¡ªup
who worries?

305
00:24:08,927 --> 00:24:10,622
If you¡¯re killed, I¡¯ll be free.

306
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:12,727
If I¡¯m killed, it really doesn¡¯t matter.

307
00:24:12,895 --> 00:24:15,056
If we both die, good riddance!

308
00:24:15,286 --> 00:24:17,538
Go ahead, crash it. Crash it!

309
00:24:24,894 --> 00:24:28,819
Gerry, get the light. Its your turn.

310
00:24:54,816 --> 00:24:57,649
I just want to see you

311
00:24:57,768 --> 00:25:00,692
When you¡¯re all alone

312
00:25:01,457 --> 00:25:06,099
I just want to catch you if I can

313
00:25:08,409 --> 00:25:14,655
I just want to be there
when the morning light explodes

314
00:25:15,287 --> 00:25:18,541
On your face it radiates

315
00:25:18,692 --> 00:25:20,296
I cant escape

316
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:23,106
I love you till the end

317
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:26,460
Do all Irishmen sing?

318
00:25:27,457 --> 00:25:30,051
Ill love you till the end

319
00:25:30,815 --> 00:25:32,931
Only the really well¡ªhung ones.

320
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:36,699
I cant fall asleep alone.

321
00:25:37,566 --> 00:25:41,366
¡ª I¡¯m right here, baby.
¡ª I had a terrible dream.

322
00:25:43,096 --> 00:25:44,643
Don¡¯t tell me.

323
00:25:47,206 --> 00:25:50,778
Gerry, I dont want to go back to work.

324
00:25:51,689 --> 00:25:54,533
¡ª What shoold I do?
¡ªQoit.

325
00:25:55,892 --> 00:25:57,336
Stay here with me.

326
00:26:04,974 --> 00:26:07,260
I don¡¯t have a plan, Gerry.

327
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:10,541
That¡¯s okay, luv,
your plans never work out, anay.

328
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,285
That¡¯s true.

329
00:26:29,814 --> 00:26:39,644
Md all because of the man that got away

330
00:26:40,487 --> 00:26:46,574
No more his eager call

331
00:26:46,767 --> 00:26:52,933
The writings on the wall

332
00:26:53,096 --> 00:26:59,854
The dreams you dreamed have all

333
00:26:59,971 --> 00:27:04,362
Gone astray

334
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:13,206
The man that won you
has gone off and undone you

335
00:27:13,362 --> 00:27:19,050
That treat beginning
has seen that final inning

336
00:27:19,893 --> 00:27:23,135
Dont knnw what happened

337
00:27:23,331 --> 00:27:29,133
Its all a crazy game

338
00:27:30,971 --> 00:27:36,898
No more that all¡ªtime thrill

339
00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:43,261
For youve been through the mill

340
00:27:43,456 --> 00:27:54,412
Md never a new love will be the same

341
00:27:54,893 --> 00:27:59,057
Good riddance goodbye

342
00:28:12,847 --> 00:28:14,769
Happy Birthday!

343
00:28:16,642 --> 00:28:18,007
You¡¯re 30!

344
00:28:18,533 --> 00:28:22,537
Hey, Holly, these were falling out
of your mailbox.

345
00:28:24,129 --> 00:28:25,005
What is that smell?

346
00:28:25,051 --> 00:28:26,541
I wasnt expecting company.

347
00:28:26,612 --> 00:28:28,011
Mom, dont clean.

348
00:28:28,176 --> 00:28:29,973
Tm not. Ill just organize the garbage.

349
00:28:30,129 --> 00:28:32,051
We did try to call first.

350
00:28:32,691 --> 00:28:35,012
¡ª Are you drunk?
¡ª No.

351
00:28:35,178 --> 00:28:36,896
¡ª Do you wanna be?
¡ªCiara!

352
00:28:37,896 --> 00:28:40,979
¡ª What happened to your heed?
¡ª Pimple.

353
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,648
¡ª You¡¯re not showering?
¡ª Oh, you always squeeze it too hard!

354
00:28:43,739 --> 00:28:45,741
¡ª What is that smell?
¡ª It¡¯s me, all right!

355
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:50,103
¡ª Dont be like that.
¡ªLike what?

356
00:28:50,209 --> 00:28:52,746
Like the only lonely widow in Gotham City.

357
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:55,899
I¡¯m not, I¡¯m just exhausted.

358
00:28:56,099 --> 00:28:58,420
Yeah, well, what are you doing?
Two shows a night?

359
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:03,460
You know, if you want us to leave,
that¡¯s foe.

360
00:29:04,255 --> 00:29:07,497
But you do know that at some point,
this all has to stop.

361
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,616
PJl right.

362
00:29:12,177 --> 00:29:15,294
Just give me a second, okay?

363
00:29:16,771 --> 00:29:19,547
¡ª Okay, troops, let¡¯s sweep the area.
-Yes.

364
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,059
I haven¡¯t called the office. Are they mad?

365
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:33,135
Nah. Theres no rush.

366
00:29:34,214 --> 00:29:37,536
Even Larry said take all the time you need.

367
00:29:37,573 --> 00:29:39,143
The job is there when youre ready.

368
00:29:39,214 --> 00:29:40,579
That was nice of him.

369
00:29:40,651 --> 00:29:43,097
¡ª He¡¯s an asshnle.
¡ª He¡¯s still an asshole.

370
00:29:43,293 --> 00:29:47,218
Do you think it¡¯ll be all right
itt stop my life right here?

371
00:29:47,699 --> 00:29:52,011
Become the Miss Havisham
0f the Lower East Side.

372
00:29:52,136 --> 00:29:54,457
Never leave my apartment till Tm old.

373

¡ª Sit in my wedding dress.
¡ª Which you never had.

374
00:29:56,776 --> 00:29:59,529
¡ª With an old piece of wedding cake.
¡ª Which you never had.

375
00:30:00,213 --> 00:30:02,704
You gotta be rich to be insane, Hol.

376
00:30:02,775 --> 00:30:05,494
Losing your mind is not a luxury
for the middle class.

377
00:30:06,292 --> 00:30:09,455
¡ª That¡¯s so not fair.
¡ª No, it¡¯s not.

378
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:13,455
Holly? Something¡¯s been delioered for you.

379
00:30:24,443 --> 00:30:25,501
What is this?

380
00:30:27,928 --> 00:30:30,294
I dont understand. Did you do this?

381
00:30:30,569 --> 00:30:31,570
No.

382
00:30:32,646 --> 00:30:33,852
Wait a minute.

383
00:30:44,287 --> 00:30:45,811
John, tell me the truth. Did you do this?

384
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:47,964
No. I did nothing, I swear.

385
00:31:03,601 --> 00:31:06,138
Hey, baby. Surprise.

386
00:31:06,601 --> 00:31:08,808
I know this probably feels
a little bit morbid,

387
00:31:08,884 --> 00:31:11,967
but Ijust hate the idea
that Em not gonna be there

388
00:31:12,057 --> 00:31:14,298
to see you freak out over turning 30.

389
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:16,293
I mean, it kills me not to be there.

390
00:31:16,853 --> 00:31:19,094
¡ª That¡¯s funny.
¡ª No, it¡¯s not.

391
00:31:19,292 --> 00:31:20,896
Okay. No, it¡¯s not.

392
00:31:21,652 --> 00:31:23,529
You¡¯re gonna bess impressed.

393
00:31:23,653 --> 00:31:25,939
I have a plan, baby. Can you believe it?

394
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,607
I¡¯ve written you letters.

395
00:31:27,855 --> 00:31:30,346
Letters that will be coming to you
all sorts of ways.

396
00:31:30,699 --> 00:31:32,018
You know, I thought I¡¯d wait
until your birthday

397
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,654
because I figured you werent even stepping
out 0f the house for a while.

398
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,573
Letter number one will be arriving tomorrow.

399
00:31:37,853 --> 00:31:40,378
Now, you must do what I say, okay?

400
00:31:40,853 --> 00:31:42,423
Okay?

401
00:31:43,009 --> 00:31:45,500
Md dont try to figure out
how the letters are coming.

402
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:47,969
Its too brilliant, and itil ruin my plan.

403
00:31:48,135 --> 00:31:49,853
Just go along with me on this.

404
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:53,934
Because the thing is,
I just cant say goodbye yet.

405
00:31:55,885 --> 00:31:58,706
So, for starters
I want you to get dulled up,

406
00:31:58,775 --> 00:32:01,243

00:32:15,415 --> 00:32:16,780
It isn¡¯t that I don¡¯t love you, Mum.

00:35:02,569 --> 00:35:04,446
I don¡¯t know.
Maybe you¡¯re being punished for something.

466
00:35:04,571 --> 00:35:05,651
What?

467
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,298
Being too happy? Too beautiful?

468
00:35:07,369 --> 00:35:08,939
I dont know.
God can be a pretty jealous guy.

469
00:35:08,972 --> 00:35:09,779
Well, I don¡¯t believe that.

470
00:35:09,885 --> 00:35:12,501
I¡¯ve never been too happy
and I¡¯m not too beautiful.

471
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,299
I think you¡¯re hot.

472
00:35:18,573 --> 00:35:20,370
Sorry, I have a syndrome.

473
00:35:20,729 --> 00:35:24,017
I dont really have a filter.
I dont pick up on social cues.

474
00:35:24,245 --> 00:35:25,576
You mean youre rude?

475
00:35:25,651 --> 00:35:28,609
Yeah, but now it¡¯s a disease
I can take medication for.

476
00:35:28,963 --> 00:35:31,966
¡ª They have pills for rudeness?
¡ªIknow.

477
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:34,420
Md they can¡¯t figure out the Middle East.
Go figure.

478
00:35:36,852 --> 00:35:39,605
Hey, you¡¯re Irish.
Maybe it¡¯s an Irish curse or something.

479
00:35:40,336 --> 00:35:42,975
Well, Gerry and I did love the Yankees

480
00:35:43,055 --> 00:35:45,421
which was pretty much against our religion.

481
00:35:45,454 --> 00:35:46,421
Well, there you go.

482
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:48,885
That eoplains a lot, actually.
I love the Yankees too

483
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,064
and I lost my fiancee last year.

484
00:35:51,569 --> 00:35:52,376
Really?

485
00:35:52,413 --> 00:35:56,008
Yeah, she slept with my best friend.
She left me.

486
00:35:57,523 --> 00:35:59,696
My best friend was a woman.

487
00:36:00,851 --> 00:36:02,170
Her last words to me were

488
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,417
Id still be with you
if you werent a man.

489
00:36:04,493 --> 00:36:06,814
Md I¡¯m like, ¡®Well, castrating me

490
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:10,344
is definitely the first step
toward achieving that particular goal.¡±

491
00:36:10,727 --> 00:36:11,967
It¡¯s still my fault, though.
I introduced them.

492
00:36:12,057 --> 00:36:15,527
I always had this fantasy about making love
to two women at the same time.

493
00:36:15,649 --> 00:36:19,449
Except in my fantasy, I was still in the bed
for the second end third time.

494
00:36:19,726 --> 00:36:21,967
-Sorry.
¡ª Then this¡¯ll make you feel great.

495
00:36:22,056 --> 00:36:25,856
The best friend that my ex¡ªfianee
slept with was my ex¡ªex¡ªfiance

496
00:36:25,932 --> 00:36:29,174
and she was my business partner,
and we started the business with my money.

497
00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:33,578
So I ended up losing the business,
my partner and my fiancee.

498
00:36:35,057 --> 00:36:36,968
Howd you get over that?

499
00:36:38,213 --> 00:36:42,172
I went through like a major hooker phase
all year.

500
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:44,781
¡ª But that didn¡¯t help.
¡ª No, it helped a lot.

501
00:36:44,884 --> 00:36:48,570
I just started to run out of money.
It¡¯s actually a lot cheaper to date.

502
00:36:50,569 --> 00:36:54,221
Do you think that you¡¯re gonna ever find
another woman to love?

503
00:36:55,493 --> 00:37:00,601
No. No I think I repel the women
that I want the most.

504
00:37:02,415 --> 00:37:05,213
¡ª Thats not true.
¡ª No?

505
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:12,776
No?

506
00:37:43,008 --> 00:37:44,498
Thank you, Daniel.

507
00:37:52,694 --> 00:37:55,572
You can start closing up downstairs.

508
00:37:58,208 --> 00:37:58,936
Right.

509
00:38:38,966 --> 00:38:40,251
What do you want?

510
00:38:41,013 --> 00:38:42,378
Oh, good. A friendly voice.

511
00:38:43,605 --> 00:38:45,175
What happened last night?

512
00:38:45,324 --> 00:38:47,736
Lemon drops and tequila, my friend.

513
00:38:47,933 --> 00:38:50,379
The moment where a 30¡ªyear¡ªold body
does not recover

514
00:38:50,482 --> 00:38:53,258
quite as fast as a 20¡ªyear¡ªold body.

515
00:38:53,326 --> 00:38:55,123
Stop screaming at me.

516
00:38:55,326 --> 00:38:57,453
¡ª Are you working?
¡ª Hell, no.

517
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,945
But I told him were gonna start next week.

518
00:39:00,047 --> 00:39:02,948
You and lore gonna go out starting Monday.
Is that okay?

519
00:39:03,047 --> 00:39:08,610
No, I was planning on
staying in bed and dying today.

520
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:13,971
Well, you can¡¯t.
You gotta go check the mailbox, remember?

521
00:39:14,328 --> 00:39:16,330
Call me immediately.

522
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:41,885
Save yourself bruises
and buy yourself a bedside lamp.

523
00:39:42,041 --> 00:39:45,693
Md remember,
a disco diva must look her best.

524
00:39:45,807 --> 00:39:48,048
Go buy yourself a knock¡ªout outfit.

525
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:50,019
YouII need it
for when my next letter comes.

526
00:39:50,091 --> 00:39:51,171
Need it for what?

527
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:53,053
Md lknow you hate your job,

528
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:54,569
but Ill help.

529
00:39:54,812 --> 00:39:57,258
Look fore sign. YouII know whet to do.

530
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:05,214
P.S. I love you.

531
00:40:59,524 --> 00:41:01,606
I still know you¡¯re around.

532
00:41:02,837 --> 00:41:05,010
You¡¯re still here, aren¡¯t you?

533
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:09,564
So who lived here before?

534
00:41:09,729 --> 00:41:11,685
A family. Theyre having another baby.

535
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,896
-Dv you have any children?
¡ª Three. Girls.

536
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:17,536
¡ª Teenagers.
¡ª Thats nice.

537
00:41:19,481 --> 00:41:22,177
Ted, Sharon says
there¡¯s another offer on the table

538
00:41:22,247 --> 00:41:23,817
and we have to move on this,
so Isay we do it.

539
00:41:23,935 --> 00:41:26,608
I think if you offer another hundred grand,
they¡¯ll back right down.

540
00:41:26,732 --> 00:41:29,462
Well, Vick, maybe we should talk about it.

541
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:31,611
We don¡¯t have time, Ted.
We have to tell her today.

542
00:41:31,654 --> 00:41:32,939
But we said we didn¡¯t want to go
over a certain...

543
00:41:33,015 --> 00:41:35,336
I know, but we love this apartment,
and it is what it is.

544
00:41:35,405 --> 00:41:36,611
There¡¯s nothing else out there.

545
00:41:36,733 --> 00:41:38,815
This is what a good apartment costs.

546
00:41:38,852 --> 00:41:40,456
But we were already looking beyond our cap.

547
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:42,179
¡ª I wanna be near the river.
¡ª I think we should think about another area

548
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:43,690
¡ª Jam not living in Brooklyn, Ted.
¡ª It¡¯s a lot!

549
00:41:43,765 --> 00:41:45,255
¡ª Forget it.
¡ª Will you listen to him?

550
00:41:45,326 --> 00:41:46,020
¡ªWhat?
¡ªWhat?

551
00:41:46,202 --> 00:41:47,851
He¡¯s obviously worried about this.

552
00:41:48,015 --> 00:41:49,687
¡ª Look at him. He¡¯s pale.
¡ª Hol.

553
00:41:49,811 --> 00:41:51,608
Who are you to tell me
how to talk to my husbaod?

554
00:41:51,687 --> 00:41:54,133
Tm just sayiog you shouldnt push this
on him if he doesnt wanna do it.

555
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,849
¡ª Hol?
¡ª Ill push whatever the hell I want on him.

556
00:41:55,968 --> 00:41:57,538
Hes my husband. I want this apartment.

557
00:41:57,608 --> 00:41:58,973
¡ª We¡¯re doing this.
¡ª Say no, Ted

558
00:41:59,046 --> 00:42:01,173
It is amazing to me
that you are still talking.

559
00:42:01,295 --> 00:42:03,820
¡ª Ted, don¡¯t listen to her.
¡ª Ted, she¡¯d being a tyrant.

560
00:42:03,851 --> 00:42:07,560
She¡¯s got your balls on one of those things
that, you know, clink back and forth.

561
00:42:07,652 --> 00:42:08,664
¡ª You know what I mean?
¡ªYeah.

562
00:42:08,732 --> 00:42:10,461

¡ªShut up.
¡ª You shut up.

564
00:42:11,733 --> 00:42:12,609
No, you shut up.

00:42:12,889 --> 00:42:15,210
Twill end you, and when I do....

566
00:42:15,295 --> 00:42:15,943

¡ª Ill tell you something right now.
¡ª No. No. No. Okay, tell me.

He¡¯s my husband, and Ill talk to him
the way I wanna talk to him!

569
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:22,176
Md I¡¯m not living in Brooklyn!
Do you know who lam?

570
00:42:22,296 --> 00:42:23,945
What¡¯s wrong with Brooklyn, lady?

00:43:08,762 --> 00:43:09,683
ke you Holly Kennedy?

572
00:43:09,841 --> 00:43:10,853
If I am, will you sing at me?

573
00:43:10,968 --> 00:43:12,128
-Yes.
¡ª No, I¡¯m not.

574
00:43:12,296 --> 00:43:15,538
Look, please don¡¯t make this an issue.
I gotta sing and deliver a letter.

575
00:43:15,655 --> 00:43:17,179

By who, the leprechaun union?

580
00:43:22,172 --> 00:43:25,812
You know, I was in an off¡ªBroadway play
with Al goddamn Pacino.

581
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,176
I dont need this shit.

582
00:43:27,609 --> 00:43:28,564
¡ª You want the balloons?
¡ª No.

583
00:43:28,656 --> 00:43:29,463
Fine.

584
00:43:42,326 --> 00:43:44,612
You bastard.
There¡¯s absolutely no way I¡¯m doing this.

¡ª Yes, you are.

¡ª Oh, yes, you are.
¡ª Oh, no, I¡¯m not.

587
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:50,611

00:44:03,561 --> 00:44:06,416
Ride, Sally, ride

Yeah!

593
00:44:07,766 --> 00:44:11,566
One of these early mornings

594
00:44:12,298 --> 00:44:19,374
You gonna be wiping those weeping eyes

595

00:44:35,477 --> 00:44:36,887
Oh, my God.

599
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,557
¡ª One more!
¡ªOkay.

600
00:44:42,761 --> 00:44:45,685
I guess its time to give somebody else
a chance here now. Who wants a shot?

601
00:44:46,478 --> 00:44:48,048
Mybody else here willing to give it a go?

602
00:44:48,682 --> 00:44:49,762
Yourself? No?

603
00:44:50,402 --> 00:44:53,690
Young lady. Come on. Don¡¯t be shy!

604
00:44:53,888 --> 00:44:55,617
What about Holly?

605
00:44:56,481 --> 00:44:57,209
¡ª Stop it.
¡ª Holly.

606
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:58,483
I dont know about that, John.

607
00:44:58,685 --> 00:45:01,586
Holly¡¯s my wife, by the way.
My beautiful wife.

608
00:45:01,684 --> 00:45:05,131
Mdl do, I love Holly, I do.

609
00:45:06,326 --> 00:45:12,049
But she would never have the guts
to do something like this.

610
00:45:12,655 --> 00:45:14,976
Oh, no.

611
00:45:16,326 --> 00:45:19,250
In fact, she ate me head off
about coming out tonight.

612
00:45:19,402 --> 00:45:21,973
You know, she had a long day at the office.

613
00:45:23,404 --> 00:45:25,816
Shell never do it. Yep.

614
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:33,170
Oh, you think so?
You think she¡¯d get up here?

615
00:45:33,246 --> 00:45:39,207
Okay, III bet you 100 dollars,
she doesnt get upon this stage.

616
00:45:47,762 --> 00:45:49,093
Make it two.

617
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,851
What is she doing? What is she doing?

618
00:46:13,246 --> 00:46:15,020
That¡¯s my wife, the surpriser.

619
00:46:21,043 --> 00:46:25,093
How can I put this in a way
soas to not to offend or unnerve

620
00:46:25,129 --> 00:46:25,686


621
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:29,684
But theres a rumor going all around
that you aint been getting semed

622
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:30,534
Pd right.

623
00:46:30,652 --> 00:46:34,770
They say that you ain¡¯t ¡°You know what¡±
in, baby, who knows how long

624
00:46:35,451 --> 00:46:39,455
It¡¯s hard for me to say what¡¯s right
when all I wanna do is wrong

625
00:46:39,842 --> 00:46:44,131
Get off, 23 positions in a one¡ªnight stand

626
00:46:44,562 --> 00:46:49,135
Get off, I¡¯ll only call you after
if you say Ican

627
00:46:49,453 --> 00:46:54,049
Get off, let a woman be a woman
and a man be a man

628
00:46:54,172 --> 00:46:59,895
Get off, if you want to, baby,
Here lam, here Jam

629
00:47:00,968 --> 00:47:01,946
¡ªOh,God!
¡ªOh,God!

630
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,629
Do you mind coffee?

631
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:26,016
How do you feel? You look good.

632
00:47:31,495 --> 00:47:34,942
I¡¯m sorry, baby, butt have to say
you were really good before you...

633
00:47:35,012 --> 00:47:39,779
My nose is broken, Gerry.
My ankle is twisted. Happy?

634
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:41,291
What, are you mad at me?

635
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:43,497
I didnt wanna go out tonight
and you made me.

636
00:47:43,651 --> 00:47:46,552
I hate karaoke
and you forced me to go up there.

637
00:47:46,698 --> 00:47:48,654
Oh, come on, honey. It was nobody¡¯s fault.

638
00:47:50,464 --> 00:47:52,011
Oh, come here, baby. Give me a...

639
00:47:53,214 --> 00:47:54,420
Give me a kiss.

640
00:48:05,541 --> 00:48:07,748
Well, how long you gonna be mad for?

641
00:48:11,182 --> 00:48:12,661
I never let him off the hook.

642
00:48:12,775 --> 00:48:14,697
Mytime I was mad,
I made him feel bad about it.

643
00:48:14,822 --> 00:48:16,778
I was mad at him
when we left the house that night.

644
00:48:16,853 --> 00:48:18,502
I was mad at him
because our apartment was too small.

645
00:48:18,651 --> 00:48:20,061
Its so stupid.

646
00:48:20,136 --> 00:48:21,216
Baby, you were married.

647
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:24,464
Married people make each other
feel like shit on purpose sometimes.

648
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:25,496
It jost feels good.

649
00:48:26,573 --> 00:48:30,065
Gerry knew you were crazy about him.
He told me all the time.

650
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:32,182
Well, I wish I would¡¯ve told him that night.

651
00:48:33,213 --> 00:48:34,419
So tell him now.

652
00:48:36,776 --> 00:48:39,552
Its slightly dirty. Just slightly.

653
00:48:45,542 --> 00:48:48,705
Oh, he¡¯s delicious, isn¡¯t he?

654
00:48:50,292 --> 00:48:52,374
You could serve coffee on thst ass.

655
00:48:53,417 --> 00:48:57,376
Do you have to be so vulgar about men
like they¡¯re pieces of meat?

656
00:48:58,183 --> 00:49:01,630
I¡¯m sorry, John. I forgot you¡¯re sensitive
about your f at ass.

657
00:49:02,979 --> 00:49:06,506
You know, Denise,
that¡¯s why you¡¯re not married.

658
00:49:08,464 --> 00:49:11,627
Women act like men,
then they complain men don¡¯t want them.

659
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:13,142
Oh, is that why?

660
00:49:15,214 --> 00:49:17,375
Okay. Because I thought
it was something different.

661
00:49:18,574 --> 00:49:21,293
I thought it was because
I thought that I deserve the best.

662
00:49:21,496 --> 00:49:24,863
Md hes out there.
Hes just with all the wrong women.

663
00:49:25,372 --> 00:49:26,350
Md let me be clear.

664
00:49:26,419 --> 00:49:29,786
After centuries of men looking at my tits

665
00:49:29,857 --> 00:49:31,063
instead of my eyes

666
00:49:31,216 --> 00:49:33,855
and pinching my ass
instead of shaking my hand,

667
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:38,494
I now have the divine right
to stare at a man¡¯s backside

668
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:42,192
with vulgar, cheap appreciation,
if Iwant to.

669
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:43,500
¡ª Well said.
¡ªIthoughtso.

670
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:45,143
New York City, how we doing?

671
00:49:45,776 --> 00:49:47,698
Hey, guys, we¡¯re here!

672
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:49,778
Let¡¯s give a warm welcome
to our nest singer.

673
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:52,221
Md rumor has it
this is her return engagement,

674
00:49:52,341 --> 00:49:54,753
sol want you to put your hands together
for Holly.

675
00:50:00,062 --> 00:50:03,020
This is for you, Gerry, you son of a bitch.

676
00:50:22,575 --> 00:50:28,298
Ijustwanna tell you
nothing you don¡¯t want to hear

677
00:50:29,216 --> 00:50:33,937
iI Iwant is foryou to say

678
00:50:35,856 --> 00:50:42,785
Oh, why don¡¯t you just take me
where I¡¯ve never been before

679
00:50:42,902 --> 00:50:47,475
I know you want to hear me
catch my breath

680
00:50:48,341 --> 00:50:51,139
I love you till the end

681
00:50:55,214 --> 00:50:58,183
I love you till the end

682
00:51:02,386 --> 00:51:04,980
I love you till the end

683
00:51:20,545 --> 00:51:21,785
Okay, let me get this straight.

684
00:51:21,982 --> 00:51:24,940
You¡¯re straight, you¡¯re single,
and you own your own business?

685
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:25,868
Its my own club.

686
00:51:26,015 --> 00:51:28,552
Tm doing a big renovation right now.
Its gonna open in the spring.

687
00:51:29,015 --> 00:51:31,859
I could show it to you if you want.
Its over on 10th Avenue.

688
00:51:32,468 --> 00:51:34,789
¡ª Wanna go?
¡ªGreat.

689
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,709
Yeah. Let me just do one thing first.

690
00:51:52,216 --> 00:51:54,264
¡ª Whets my name?
¡ªTom.

691
00:51:55,012 --> 00:51:58,015
¡ª Where have you been?
¡ª With all the wrong women.

692
00:52:05,214 --> 00:52:10,390
Hey, Gerry. You lost weight.

693
00:52:12,494 --> 00:52:13,938
Thanks for inviting me.

694
00:52:16,058 --> 00:52:20,017
¡ª Youre a terrible singer.
¡ªYes lam.

695
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:22,422
Id be really embarrassed if I were you.

696
00:52:22,574 --> 00:52:23,939
Did you take your medication today?

697
00:52:24,902 --> 00:52:26,836
No, I thought I¡¯d come here instead.

698
00:52:28,825 --> 00:52:33,023
Say, I¡¯m feeling kind of hungry. You feel
like getting a bite or something to drink?

699
00:52:33,185 --> 00:52:35,836
No, Im...I don¡¯t think so.

700
00:52:36,746 --> 00:52:38,395
¡ª All right.
¡ªThanks.

701
00:52:43,623 --> 00:52:46,342
I don¡¯t mean to throw this at you
from left field, but what do women want?

702
00:52:46,466 --> 00:52:47,865
I mean, I can¡¯t figure it out.

703
00:52:47,981 --> 00:52:50,063
They want us to ask.
They dont want us to ask.

704
00:52:50,138 --> 00:52:51,662
They want us to make a move,
not make a move.

705
00:52:51,747 --> 00:52:54,750
They want us to be on the bottom.
They want us to be on top.

706
00:52:54,856 --> 00:52:56,835
Use hair products, dont ose hair products.

707
00:52:56,934 --> 00:52:58,982
What do you people want?

708
00:52:59,185 --> 00:53:02,427
I¡¯ll tell you, but you have to promise
not to say I told you.

709
00:53:02,467 --> 00:53:05,186
¡ª I swear.
¡ª Because its a sacred secret.

710
00:53:05,342 --> 00:53:06,582
Sacred secret.

711
00:53:06,748 --> 00:53:08,067
¡ª You ready?
¡ªYeah.

712
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:09,140
¡ª Are you sure?
-Ithinkso.

713
00:53:09,654 --> 00:53:10,348
Come here.

714
00:53:12,109 --> 00:53:14,657
We have absolutely no idea what we want.

715
00:53:15,343 --> 00:53:16,196
I knew it!

716
00:53:17,064 --> 00:53:18,759
I knew that! Son of a bitch!

717
00:53:23,218 --> 00:53:24,025
Yeah.

718
00:53:28,188 --> 00:53:33,376
Look, if you ever just wanna get out,
just do anything, just...

719
00:53:35,826 --> 00:53:37,475
I¡¯ll wait for your call.

720
00:53:38,466 --> 00:53:41,469
Md just so you know,
I¡¯m not looking for a thing right now.

721
00:53:41,546 --> 00:53:45,710
¡ª Tm just flirting in good faith.
¡ª I appreciate that.

722
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:49,230
Maybe we can defy God
and go see a Yankees game.

723
00:53:49,266 --> 00:53:50,198
Yeah.

724
00:53:51,547 --> 00:53:52,912
Well be really weird friends,

725
00:53:53,016 --> 00:53:55,473
joined by self¡ªpity, bitterness and vomit.

726
00:53:57,266 --> 00:53:58,836
¡ª I like that.
¡ª Me too.

727
00:54:19,293 --> 00:54:21,067
My leather jacket is for you.

728
00:54:21,293 --> 00:54:23,989
I always loved the way that looked on you.

729
00:54:24,262 --> 00:54:26,628
But the rest of my stuff, you don¡¯t need it.

730
00:54:27,295 --> 00:54:31,072
Make some space in that bloody apartment
for yourself. Go on.

731
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:34,063
It¡¯s time, baby.

732
00:54:35,702 --> 00:54:38,751
P.S. I love you.

733
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,349
I think you¡¯re a little bit perverted.

734
00:55:11,014 --> 00:55:14,017
I mean, you bring me
to an Irish famine memorial

735
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:17,939
and we¡¯re eating corned beef sandwiches.
That¡¯s pretty sick.

736
00:55:18,107 --> 00:55:21,144
Gerry thought, it was the best way
to honor the dead.

737
00:55:21,341 --> 00:55:23,195
You know, show them how well we¡¯re doing.

738
00:55:25,623 --> 00:55:27,272
I¡¯m sorry I always bring him up.

739
00:55:27,342 --> 00:55:29,503
Yeah, I¡¯m starting to get
a little bit sick of it.

740
00:55:35,937 --> 00:55:38,576
Now that¡¯s a real honest¡ªto¡ªgoodness couple
right there.

741
00:55:38,654 --> 00:55:40,508
They¡¯ve probably been together
since the Flood.

742
00:55:42,264 --> 00:55:43,913
We¡¯re so arrogant, aren¡¯t we?

743
00:55:44,468 --> 00:55:47,346
We¡¯re so afraid to age,
we do everything we can to prevent it.

744
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:51,833
We don¡¯t realize what a privilege it is
to grow old with someone,

745
00:55:51,936 --> 00:55:55,713
someone who doesnt drive you
to commit murder.

746
00:55:56,937 --> 00:56:00,862
Or doesnt humiliate you beyond repair.

747
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:03,300
Its sweet.

748
00:56:08,343 --> 00:56:09,275
Its good, huh?

749
00:56:13,936 --> 00:56:15,631
¡ª Can I ask a favor?
¡ª Sure.

750
00:56:16,343 --> 00:56:18,265
I started bagging up Gerrys stuff.

751
00:56:18,342 --> 00:56:22,756
Couldnt finish. I think I need someone
who didnt know him to get rid of it all.

752
00:56:23,138 --> 00:56:24,389
Id be happy to help you get rid of Gerry.

753
00:56:24,467 --> 00:56:25,479
Do you have to say it like that?

754
00:56:25,546 --> 00:56:26,752
What, I want to say it like what?
I didn¡¯t say anything.

755
00:56:26,827 --> 00:56:28,624
¡ª What is wrong with you? Take a pill.
¡ª Nothing. What?

756
00:56:47,748 --> 00:56:50,296
¡ª Whats wrong?
¡ªNothing,I...

757
00:56:51,498 --> 00:56:55,218
lye just never been alone with another man
in this apartment besides Gerry.

758
00:56:55,263 --> 00:56:57,857
You want me to stand out in the hail?
You can just throw me the buses.

759
00:56:57,982 --> 00:57:00,428
No. Thats okay.

760
00:57:01,653 --> 00:57:04,304
Sorry. I¡¯m gonna change.

761
00:57:07,106 --> 00:57:08,391
Feel free to look through stuff.

762
00:57:08,496 --> 00:57:10,396
If there¡¯s anything of Gerry¡¯s you want,
just let me know.

763
00:57:11,465 --> 00:57:12,466
Okay.

764
00:57:33,822 --> 00:57:37,781
I cant remember the last time
somebody held me like this.

765
00:57:43,103 --> 00:57:46,937
¡ª Did you find a new husband yet?
¡ªShut up.

766
00:57:48,932 --> 00:57:53,551
Where have you been?
I havent felt you around lately.

767
00:57:53,618 --> 00:57:58,214
Please. I¡¯ve been so around.

768
00:58:02,774 --> 00:58:05,060
I can feel you hugging me.

769
00:58:05,494 --> 00:58:07,223
That¡¯s because Jam.

770
00:58:13,652 --> 00:58:14,698
You look great.

771
00:59:05,456 --> 00:59:06,707
This is the one.

772
00:59:12,346 --> 00:59:14,894
¡ª Are you Barbara?
¡ª Yes, may I help you?

773
00:59:15,986 --> 00:59:17,305
Ihopeso.

774
00:59:23,533 --> 00:59:24,864
Youre his wife.

775
00:59:27,736 --> 00:59:29,021
He was here?

776
00:59:36,093 --> 00:59:38,812
So I dont understand.
Ynure taking a vacation?

777
00:59:38,890 --> 00:59:39,948
Its a trip.

778
00:59:40,219 --> 00:59:44,656
Gerry planned the whole thing
for me and Sharon and Denise.

779
00:59:45,296 --> 00:59:47,503
Do you think its the best time to vacation?

780
00:59:47,656 --> 00:59:49,817
Gerry made all the arrangements.
Ihave to go.

781
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:52,020
Have you spoken to Daniel?

782
00:59:52,658 --> 00:59:54,512
Thought you two were spending time together.

783
00:59:54,612 --> 00:59:55,863
Were just friends, Mum.

784
00:59:58,098 --> 01:00:00,350
You know, I¡¯ve stood by
and not said anything about all this,

785
01:00:00,457 --> 01:00:02,231
but now I think its time it stopped.

786
01:00:02,301 --> 01:00:04,155
¡ª What do you mean?
¡ª It¡¯s not healthy.

787
01:00:04,787 --> 01:00:07,540
Gerrys not gonna be able
to keep this up forever, is he?

788
01:00:07,786 --> 01:00:10,072
His life ended, and so will his letters.

789
01:00:10,786 --> 01:00:12,902
At some point, you¡¯re gonns have
to face things on your own.

790
01:00:12,987 --> 01:00:15,706
It was a gift from Gerry.

791
01:00:16,658 --> 01:00:18,148
Md how can you say that?

792
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:20,996
My husband was 35 years old.
He wasnt supposed to die.

793
01:00:21,096 --> 01:00:23,792
But he did. It was awful.

794
01:00:24,733 --> 01:00:26,064
Its what happens.

795
01:00:26,577 --> 01:00:28,784
But his death is a part of your life now.

796
01:00:28,822 --> 01:00:29,868
Md you have to deal with it.

797
01:00:29,937 --> 01:00:32,861
Stop saying that
like Fm not dealing with it. Jam.

798
01:00:32,984 --> 01:00:36,226
How? By waiting for a letter
from a dead husband?

799
01:00:36,374 --> 01:00:37,898
Taking a vacation?

800
01:00:38,095 --> 01:00:40,427
When your father left,
I had two children to support.

801
01:00:40,531 --> 01:00:42,021
Well, excuse me for not having any children.

802
01:00:42,142 --> 01:00:44,064
That¡¯s not howl meant it and you know it.

803
01:00:44,985 --> 01:00:47,306
Your father leaving was just as devastating.

804
01:00:47,938 --> 01:00:50,304
But I did what I needed to do
and got on with it.

805
01:00:50,423 --> 01:00:51,981
¡ª It¡¯s not the same thing.
¡ª And why not?

806
01:00:52,017 --> 01:00:54,224
My husband died. He was taken.

807
01:00:54,346 --> 01:00:56,143
He didn¡¯t wanna go, he didn¡¯t wanna leave.

808
01:00:56,378 --> 01:00:58,949
Yes, my husband wanted to leave.

809
01:00:59,096 --> 01:01:03,305
Md it¡¯s so much easier
being abandoned by choice, is it?

810
01:01:16,348 --> 01:01:19,465
I¡¯ve had my say. I won¡¯t say anymore.

811
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:32,430
So where¡¯s he sending you?

812
01:02:26,502 --> 01:02:29,357
Oh, my God. Get the bags.

813
01:02:30,861 --> 01:02:31,987
¡ª Oh, right.
¡ª She just elbowed me.

814
01:02:32,065 --> 01:02:35,228
Yeah, you know what? If that¡¯s an indication
of how this trips gonna be,

815
01:02:35,299 --> 01:02:36,175
I wont have it.

816
01:02:54,607 --> 01:02:55,710
Is that her bag?

817
01:02:55,935 --> 01:02:57,983
Holly, is that her bag? Leave it.

818
01:02:58,140 --> 01:02:59,619
¡ª I mean, this is heavy.
¡ª Dont take it in.

819
01:03:08,611 --> 01:03:09,384
Holly?

820
01:03:09,581 --> 01:03:10,787
¡ª This is heavy.
¡ªIknow.

821
01:03:10,894 --> 01:03:12,225
Holly?

822
01:03:16,254 --> 01:03:17,380
Look.

823
01:03:21,426 --> 01:03:23,109
Hey, Big Mama.

824
01:03:23,349 --> 01:03:25,749
Make sure my baby has a good time.

825
01:03:26,457 --> 01:03:29,233
Make sure you and John
do everything you wanna do,

826
01:03:29,738 --> 01:03:31,467
wheneoer you wanna do it.

827
01:03:31,738 --> 01:03:34,184
Md make sure my baby does things.

828
01:03:35,223 --> 01:03:37,430
¡ª I want you to take her fishing.¡¯
¡ªOh,God.

829
01:03:37,502 --> 01:03:40,255
Hes been wanting to get me on a lake
since forever.

830
01:03:41,455 --> 01:03:45,619
And be sure to give yourself a big,
sweaty pony¡ªboy kiss from me.

831
01:03:45,986 --> 01:03:48,227
Jerk. He will never let me forget
my bachelorette party.

832
01:03:48,377 --> 01:03:50,584
-Joey the Pony Boy.
¡ªTony.

833
01:03:50,704 --> 01:03:51,898
Tony, I remember him.

834
01:03:52,095 --> 01:03:55,303
I bet Ihave a letter too.
Where do you think hed hide one for me?

835
01:03:55,579 --> 01:03:56,432
Bedroom.

836
01:03:56,783 --> 01:04:00,310
¡°Denise, take Holly to Whelan¡¯s,
my favorite pub.

837
01:04:00,456 --> 01:04:04,347
There¡¯s beautiful music to be heard,
beautiful people to be around.

838
01:04:04,425 --> 01:04:07,861
Md, Denise, you¡¯re going to heaven
for being my baby¡¯s friend.

839
01:04:08,502 --> 01:04:11,585
Tm making all the arrangements up here
for you.

840
01:04:11,892 --> 01:04:13,587
Got a few hot men lined op.

841
01:04:13,657 --> 01:04:16,182
I hear Ben Franklins
hung like a race horse.

842
01:04:17,251 --> 01:04:18,434
Love you.

843
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:21,947
I dont know how you do this.

01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:23,715
Let me see it.

What?

846
01:04:30,018 --> 01:04:31,747
He didn¡¯t leave me a letter.

847
01:04:33,423 --> 01:04:36,586
Well, probably didn¡¯t love you
as much as us.

848
01:04:43,095 --> 01:04:44,255
You know, this was the...

Oh, my God, look at that. Look at that!

851
01:04:56,019 --> 01:04:58,658
Oh, my God.

852

Oh, yeah. Yeah, you¡¯re gonna go talk to him.

¡ª Oh, yeah.

01:05:40,423 --> 01:05:41,435
¡ª Are you kidding me?
¡ª Flatter him. Go.

861
01:05:41,502 --> 01:05:42,821
We don¡¯t have those in the States!

01:05:42,894 --> 01:05:44,430
¡ª Go, go, go.
¡ª We don¡¯t make those up!

Oh, you¡¯ve got much better stuff
than those tarts. You¡¯re experienced.

868
01:06:03,782 --> 01:06:06,353
Plus, you¡¯re American. You¡¯ve tot
foreign exotic stuff going for you.

869
01:06:06,455 --> 01:06:08,252
There is nothing exotic
about being an American.

870
01:06:08,375 --> 01:06:09,785
¡ª He doesn¡¯t know that.
¡ª We¡¯re gonna help you.

871
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:11,020
¡ª Just take it off.

¡ª Good to have you here.
¡ªThanks.

888
01:07:07,144 --> 01:07:09,738
I have one more song to play.
Will you stay and have a listen?

889
01:07:10,064 --> 01:07:11,895
Its an American song about a local girl.

890
01:07:12,535 --> 01:07:14,503
¡ª I think youII like it.
¡ª Sure.

891

Okay, sure!

894
01:07:33,657 --> 01:07:37,536
This is an American song dedicated to Holly.

895
01:07:38,893 --> 01:07:40,303
I hope you enjoy it.

896
01:07:51,782 --> 01:07:54,580
Well, I took a stroll on the old long walk

897
01:07:54,657 --> 01:07:57,103
IY a day ¡ª1¡ªay¡ªI¡ªay

898
01:07:57,580 --> 01:08:00,151
I met a little girl and we stopped to talk

899
01:08:00,221 --> 01:08:02,587
Of a fine soft day¡ªI¡ªay

900
01:08:02,657 --> 01:08:04,431
Mdl ask you, friend

901

Well, what¡¯s a fella to do

902
01:08:08,735 --> 01:08:12,182
Because her hair was black
and her eyes were blue

903
01:08:13,219 --> 01:08:14,891
Mdl knew right then

904
01:08:15,812 --> 01:08:17,541
Id be taking a whirl

905
01:08:19,609 --> 01:08:22,715
Round the Saith ill Prom with a Gaiway girl

906
01:08:34,731 --> 01:08:38,178
¡ª Thats a very nice jacket!
¡ª I won it in a bet.

907
01:08:41,575 --> 01:08:44,351
We were halfiaay there
when the rain came down

908
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:47,021
O a day ¡ª1¡ªay ¡ªI¡ªay

909
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:49,785
Md she asked me up to her flat downtown

910

O a fine soft day ¡ªI¡ªay¡ª1¡ªay

911
01:08:52,248 --> 01:08:53,818
Mdl ask you, friend,

912
01:08:54,859 --> 01:08:56,508
what¡¯s a fella to do

913
01:08:58,704 --> 01:09:01,741
Because her hair was black
and her eyes were blue

914
01:09:03,219 --> 01:09:04,254
Enough of this.

915
01:09:32,809 --> 01:09:35,812
Why does he keep wanting me to remember
all these things that make it harder?

916
01:09:35,934 --> 01:09:38,585
¡ª It¡¯s cruel.
¡ª I don¡¯t know, baby.

917
01:09:39,576 --> 01:09:41,453
I dont think he means to be cruel.

918
01:09:41,983 --> 01:09:43,712
What does he mean?

919
01:09:45,249 --> 01:09:46,261
I dont know.

920
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:49,381
Come on, lets go. Were taking you beck.

921
01:10:28,381 --> 01:10:30,986
¡ª I think you should find William.
¡ª No!

922
01:10:31,584 --> 01:10:34,382
I left without saying anything.
He must think Im an idiot.

923
01:10:34,536 --> 01:10:37,334
Well, you¡¯re an American.
They expect us to be idiots.

924
01:10:37,489 --> 01:10:41,414
Don¡¯t push her.
She¡¯s not ready, she¡¯s not ready.

925
01:10:42,381 --> 01:10:45,851
inithough if memory serves me correctly,
Holly,

926
01:10:45,943 --> 01:10:49,026
the longer you go without sex,
the meaner and bitchier you get.

927
01:10:49,132 --> 01:10:50,315
¡ªEat me.
¡ª Hello.

928
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:54,981
Well, I¡¯m really med at Gerry.

929
01:10:55,742 --> 01:10:57,494
Maybe thats why he did it.

930
01:10:57,851 --> 01:10:59,944
You have to stop wanting him at some point.

931
01:11:02,662 --> 01:11:03,777
When?

932
01:11:06,459 --> 01:11:07,619
¡ª Grab the pole!
¡ªWhat?

933
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:08,980
¡ª Youve got a fish!
¡ª It¡¯s a fish!

934
01:11:09,101 --> 01:11:10,944
¡ª Youve got a fish.
¡ª Holly, grab the pole!

935
01:11:11,101 --> 01:11:13,217
¡ª Okay, I¡¯m grabbing it!
¡ª Take it out 0f the thingy majiggy!

936
01:11:13,943 --> 01:11:16,059
¡ª Hurry it up!
¡ª No!

937
01:11:16,101 --> 01:11:18,854
Youre not holding the ball.
Turn the knobby thing!

938
01:11:19,021 --> 01:11:21,137
¡ª Will you stop being so butch?
¡ª Just watch it!

939
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:24,139
¡ª Help me!
¡ª Tm trying to get the fish!

940
01:11:25,586 --> 01:11:28,032
Stop with the fish! My nails are wet!

941
01:11:28,944 --> 01:11:29,751
iI right!

942
01:11:46,691 --> 01:11:47,771
Oh, my God!

943
01:11:51,407 --> 01:11:52,943
What happened to our oars?

944
01:11:59,377 --> 01:12:00,389
Oh, my God.

945
01:12:03,130 --> 01:12:04,062
Help?

946
01:12:06,207 --> 01:12:08,129
¡ª Help!
¡ª Help!

947
01:12:09,738 --> 01:12:11,615
Help!

948
01:12:16,209 --> 01:12:17,824
I hate cosmetics companies.

949
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:21,099
They get you addicted
to the perfect lipstick or nail polish

950
01:12:21,178 --> 01:12:23,214
and then six months later,
they discontinue it.

951
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:27,668
You have to buy your favorite colors
like youre storing up for the apocalypse.

952
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:29,306
That was my last bottle.

953
01:12:32,254 --> 01:12:34,302
I still think that one of us
should swim ashore

954
01:12:34,456 --> 01:12:36,742
and it should be the one of us
whos already inflated.

955
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:38,384
Okay, no, that¡¯s good. Here!

956
01:12:45,018 --> 01:12:47,179
¡ª There, go swim ashore.
¡ª Is that absolotely necessary?

957
01:12:47,254 --> 01:12:48,107
Yeah, now you can go swim ashore.

958
01:12:48,177 --> 01:12:49,974
keyou happy
that I just inhaled all these toxins?

959
01:12:50,052 --> 01:12:51,053
You jump into the brown lake!

960
01:12:51,178 --> 01:12:52,850
Stop fighting! You¡¯re acting like babies!

961
01:12:52,975 --> 01:12:54,101
¡ª All right. Shut up!
¡ª No!

962
01:12:58,101 --> 01:12:58,829
Nice.

963
01:13:07,974 --> 01:13:11,023
Maybe we¡¯ll eventually
drift towards the shore.

964
01:13:11,129 --> 01:13:13,211
What shore? That could take months!

965
01:13:13,378 --> 01:13:17,132
Better not take more than nine or else
theres gonna be another person on this boat

966
01:13:18,409 --> 01:13:19,307
What?

967
01:13:21,534 --> 01:13:23,308
I wasnt gonna say anything
until we got back.

968
01:13:24,972 --> 01:13:26,462
Tm having a baby!

969
01:13:28,974 --> 01:13:33,593
¡ª Baby? Sharon, wow.
¡ªIknow!Iknow!

970
01:13:33,818 --> 01:13:35,388
¡ª When are you due?
¡ª March.

971
01:13:35,537 --> 01:13:37,619
Oh, thank God.
You can still be in my wedding.

972
01:13:38,583 --> 01:13:41,586
¡ªWhat?
¡ª I¡¯m getting married!

973
01:13:41,661 --> 01:13:44,903
Tom proposed. I said yes,
and we¡¯re planning a New Year¡¯s Eve wedding!

974
01:13:46,051 --> 01:13:47,336
Gosh!

975
01:13:48,021 --> 01:13:49,773
Congratulations!

976
01:13:52,693 --> 01:13:54,490
-You okay?
¡ªYeah.

977
01:13:55,178 --> 01:13:55,826
No, yeah!

978
01:13:55,943 --> 01:14:01,063
No, I mean, it¡¯s just, this is just
a lot of information to get in one boat.

979
01:14:01,772 --> 01:14:03,467
Oh, baby, I¡¯m sorry.

980
01:14:03,499 --> 01:14:07,105
You know, I wasn¡¯t gonna say anything
until we got back, this is your trip.

981
01:14:07,209 --> 01:14:08,494
¡ª This is your trip.
¡ª No, no, it¡¯s okay.

982
01:14:08,614 --> 01:14:10,900
Yeah, no, me too.
But you know we might die here,

983
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:12,499
so Fm not going down as a spinster.

984
01:14:13,490 --> 01:14:15,981
¡ª Youre getting married.
¡ª Youre having a baby.

985
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:19,422
¡ª Oh, my God!
¡ª What, are you kidding me?

986
01:14:20,303 --> 01:14:21,622
¡ªWhat?
¡ªIknow!

987
01:15:01,736 --> 01:15:02,384
Whos the cook?

988
01:15:02,417 --> 01:15:03,543
¡ªTern.
¡ª Me.

989
01:15:03,815 --> 01:15:04,895
We all helped.

990
01:15:06,659 --> 01:15:09,139
Denise is getting married. Isnt that treat?

991
01:15:10,127 --> 01:15:11,207
Sharons pregnant!

992
01:15:12,175 --> 01:15:14,666
¡ª Congratulations to both of you.
¡ª Thank you.

993
01:15:16,848 --> 01:15:20,022
Food was great.
I don¡¯t think I came up for air once.

994
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:25,669
You know, it got a lot darker
while I was busy.

995
01:15:29,817 --> 01:15:31,944
Yeah, it gets dark at night here.

996
01:15:35,943 --> 01:15:38,673
¡ª You work on the lake?
¡ª Two days a week.

997
01:15:38,741 --> 01:15:40,413
Kind of a patrol man.

998
01:15:41,179 --> 01:15:43,545
ithough, I gotta say,
first time lever had to save anyone.

999
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:47,820
I feel really badly about you
having to drive all the way back this late.

1000
01:15:47,976 --> 01:15:50,058
¡ª That¡¯s enough, thank you.
¡ª Yeah, in this rain, forget it.

1001
01:15:50,258 --> 01:15:51,782
Please feel free to stay till morning.

1002
01:15:51,945 --> 01:15:55,346
Yeah, we have a pull¡ªout couch,
a bed that pulls out.

1003
01:15:58,304 --> 01:15:59,464
It is a long drive.

1004
01:16:00,898 --> 01:16:02,775
¡ª I would love a shower.
¡ª What a great idea!

1005
01:16:02,851 --> 01:16:04,751
Oh, my God.
There¡¯s one downstairs, it¡¯s fantastic!

1006
01:16:04,896 --> 01:16:07,421
I¡¯ll get you some linen and towels.
I¡¯ll show you.

1007
01:16:08,131 --> 01:16:11,623
Great. You can take your wine...

1008
01:16:20,848 --> 01:16:22,588
What are you, crazy?

1009
01:16:22,817 --> 01:16:24,341
Hes staying the whole night.

1010
01:16:24,459 --> 01:16:26,905
Hes gonna be here all night long,
all night long.

1011
01:16:27,132 --> 01:16:28,497
Hes gonna be here all night.

1012
01:17:05,048 --> 01:17:05,980
¡ª No.
-Yes.

1013
01:17:08,049 --> 01:17:09,050
I love him.

1014
01:17:10,377 --> 01:17:11,537
This is crazy.

1015
01:17:11,611 --> 01:17:14,409
Oh, my God,
you have to get pregnant immediately!

1016
01:17:14,487 --> 01:17:15,465
¡ª Immediately!
¡ª Immediately!

1017
01:17:15,613 --> 01:17:17,899
¡ª We¡¯ll have our kids together!
¡ª How cute is that?

1018
01:17:18,458 --> 01:17:20,232
¡ª How cute is that?
¡ª How does it feel?

1019
01:17:20,895 --> 01:17:24,854
I know, I have this weird feeling
like I have this boy inside 0f me.

1020
01:17:49,254 --> 01:17:53,031
Oh, Jesus! Oh, I¡¯m sorry!
I thought you were upstairs!

1021
01:17:53,178 --> 01:17:57,308
I need to just get my clothes.
Ill get out of your way.

1022
01:18:06,303 --> 01:18:07,338
Sorry about that.

1023
01:18:08,055 --> 01:18:09,625
Would you like a drink?

1024
01:18:10,257 --> 01:18:11,906
Should I just lick it off the counter then?

1025
01:18:13,179 --> 01:18:13,986
¡ªOh,no!
¡ªYeah.

1026
01:18:14,694 --> 01:18:17,595
Sorry, no, I just, it¡¯s been a long time
since I¡¯ve seen a man that naked.

1027
01:18:17,663 --> 01:18:19,142
I mean you have a...

1028
01:18:19,772 --> 01:18:20,852
How about that drink?

1029
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:23,943
¡ª You¡¯re very sweet.
¡ªOh,God.

1030
01:18:24,974 --> 01:18:26,589
The last time a guy said that,
he followed up with,

1031
01:18:26,661 --> 01:18:28,492
But I dont date 13¡ªyear¡ªolds.

1032
01:18:29,816 --> 01:18:31,420
Well, lucky for you, neither do I.

1033
01:18:33,177 --> 01:18:35,259
¡ª Cheers!
¡ª Cheers!

1034
01:18:46,176 --> 01:18:48,178
¡ª Oh, I¡¯m sorry! Sorry.
¡ª Hi.

1035
01:18:48,767 --> 01:18:51,224
Oh, I cant do this, I¡¯m sony!
It¡¯s not you, oh, I¡¯m...

1036
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:53,541
Look st me, I¡¯m just shaking,
I just, I don¡¯t know how to do this.

1037
01:18:53,611 --> 01:18:55,772
I don¡¯t even know if I want to,
I haven¡¯t been held in...

1038
01:18:55,845 --> 01:19:00,589
Oh, never mind. I¡¯m just screwed up.
I¡¯m trouble. Yeah.

1039
01:19:01,128 --> 01:19:01,947
I like trouble.

1040
01:19:01,981 --> 01:19:06,054
Oh, no, I don¡¯t mean cool,
¡®Pulp Fiction¡¯ trouble.

1041
01:19:06,131 --> 01:19:09,305
I mean, mental case. Wacko trouble.

1042
01:19:10,382 --> 01:19:11,212
I¡¯m out of my league here.

1043
01:19:11,335 --> 01:19:15,112
I mean, I haven¡¯t had a new man
in over 10 years.

1044
01:19:15,180 --> 01:19:17,387
I had this old one, I mean, he wasn¡¯t old,

1045
01:19:18,337 --> 01:19:19,781
he was just old to me
because I had him so long,

1046
01:19:19,898 --> 01:19:22,184
he was my husband, but he died.

1047
01:19:24,664 --> 01:19:26,985
Kissing him like that,
I¡¯m not surprised, poor lad.

1048
01:19:37,815 --> 01:19:39,100
No, it¡¯s not gonna work.

1049
01:19:39,847 --> 01:19:42,224
I feel like I¡¯m trying on a new pair
of shoes I really want to buy,

1050
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:43,892
but they just don¡¯t ft.

1051
01:19:44,455 --> 01:19:45,308
Sorry.

1052
01:19:45,892 --> 01:19:50,420
ni1 right then,
how about going barefoot for a while?

1053
01:20:22,806 --> 01:20:24,933
There¡¯s no man, alive or dead,

1054
01:20:25,543 --> 01:20:27,704
who¡¯s gonna fault you for living.

1055
01:20:29,011 --> 01:20:30,660
You¡¯re very sweet.

1056
01:20:33,543 --> 01:20:36,979
He was a good man, I reckon,
your man who died.

1057
01:20:38,337 --> 01:20:41,977
Yes, a very good man.

1058
01:20:51,053 --> 01:20:56,776
William? Could you drive me
to Enniskerry in the morning?

1059
01:20:57,445 --> 01:20:58,446
Sure.

1060
01:20:59,414 --> 01:21:02,861
¡ª You got friends there?
¡ª Family. Sort of.

1061
01:21:04,181 --> 01:21:06,263
In¡ªlaws. I should see them.

1062
01:21:08,291 --> 01:21:09,986
What¡¯s their name? Maybe I know them.

1063
01:21:11,183 --> 01:21:12,650
The Kennedys.

1064
01:21:14,901 --> 01:21:18,576
¡ª Not Rose and Martin?
¡ªYeah.

1065
01:21:19,651 --> 01:21:20,982
You know them?

1066
01:21:25,979 --> 01:21:30,188
¡ª Youre not Gerrys Holly?
¡ªWhat?

1067
01:21:32,778 --> 01:21:35,099
Ynure the girl from the pub that night.

1068
01:21:35,934 --> 01:21:37,708
I was in Gerrys band.

1069
01:21:38,263 --> 01:21:41,983
¡ª Not Billy Gallagher?
¡ª The one and the same.

1070
01:21:43,778 --> 01:21:45,348
Its all right.

1071
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:48,191
It¡¯s all right, you know, me and Gerry,
we shared everything together.

1072
01:21:49,138 --> 01:21:51,732
Oh, no, no, no, I didn¡¯t mean it like that.

1073
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:56,101
What I meant was,
you know, he wouldn¡¯t have a problem.

1074
01:21:57,138 --> 01:21:58,184
Well, he might have a problem

1075
01:21:58,340 --> 01:22:02,504
but, you know, there¡¯s not much
he can do about it now, is there?

1076
01:22:04,651 --> 01:22:09,736
Holly, come here. Come back to bed.

1077
01:22:11,369 --> 01:22:12,939
Now, lets talk.

1078
01:22:18,416 --> 01:22:20,099
I heard he died.

1079
01:22:22,573 --> 01:22:25,417
Tumor, was it? Yeah.

1080
01:22:26,540 --> 01:22:29,782
You know, Gerry and 1, we...

1081
01:22:29,930 --> 01:22:32,979
We hadn¡¯t seen each other
in a long, long while.

1082
01:22:34,492 --> 01:22:36,733
Sad when that happens to best friends,
isn¡¯t it?

1083
01:22:39,367 --> 01:22:42,370
He, He was a wonderful lad.

1084
01:22:46,775 --> 01:22:50,734
It¡¯s all right, you know. It¡¯s okay.

1085
01:22:52,056 --> 01:22:58,017
You know, these things,
they happen now and again, not very often,

1086
01:22:59,007 --> 01:23:00,622
but now and again.

1087
01:23:04,820 --> 01:23:07,732
Would you like me to tell you some stories
about me and Gerry?

1088
01:23:07,773 --> 01:23:09,092
Joe got plenty.

1089
01:23:10,805 --> 01:23:11,863
Yeah?

1090
01:23:12,494 --> 01:23:14,780
Okay here you go. Come on, sit back.

1091
01:23:20,698 --> 01:23:24,816
You know, he was,
he was my very, very best mate.

1092
01:23:25,012 --> 01:23:29,096
Starting back when we were terrors
running about at 5 and 6.

1093
01:23:32,089 --> 01:23:33,704
Oh, he made me laugh.

1094
01:23:34,371 --> 01:23:37,295
There was this time,
I don¡¯t remember how old we were,

1095
01:23:37,417 --> 01:23:38,941
probably, you know, 10, 11.

1096
01:23:39,652 --> 01:23:41,552
We jumped on a train...

1097
01:24:33,416 --> 01:24:37,455
We received those packsges you sent.
Come in. Come in.

1098
01:24:44,647 --> 01:24:47,650
Martin? Look who it is.

1099
01:24:48,975 --> 01:24:51,091
Oh, well, look at that.

1100
01:24:52,054 --> 01:24:55,649
Come here, dear. So nice to see you.

1101
01:24:57,131 --> 01:25:00,009
He was always one for writing. Wasnt he?

1102
01:25:00,443 --> 01:25:02,900
¡ª Shouldve gone professional.
¡ª No.

1103
01:25:03,054 --> 01:25:05,181
He did it for the love of it, Martin.

1104
01:25:05,413 --> 01:25:09,622
Now, where is it? Oh, here it is.

1105
01:25:09,695 --> 01:25:11,185
When Holly visits,

1106
01:25:11,415 --> 01:25:13,417
take her to my fort in the backyard

1107
01:25:14,056 --> 01:25:15,910
and give her this envelope.

1108
01:25:16,057 --> 01:25:18,901
He knew that I¡¯d come visit you?

1109
01:25:19,573 --> 01:25:21,575
Oh, suppose he did.

1110
01:25:21,776 --> 01:25:23,858
¡ª Martin.
¡ª All right.

1111
01:25:29,263 --> 01:25:32,505
It¡¯s not really a fort,
it¡¯s just a stone wall.

1112
01:25:33,011 --> 01:25:34,831
He used to call it that when he was little.

1113
01:25:36,775 --> 01:25:41,781
He goes on about other things,
lovely things.

1114
01:25:44,135 --> 01:25:48,094
He hadn¡¯t much strength
in the end though, did he?

1115
01:25:50,182 --> 01:25:55,063
Makes me sick to think we weren¡¯t there
when he died for the funeral.

1116
01:25:55,136 --> 01:25:57,832
But you could hardly walk
just after your operation.

1117
01:25:58,447 --> 01:26:02,736
Maybe you¡¯ll come and visit us
a bit more now that he¡¯s gone, eh?

1118
01:26:02,854 --> 01:26:04,344
Martin, don¡¯t put that on her.

1119
01:26:04,854 --> 01:26:10,019
Youre under no obligation.
Its not like were blood family.

1120
01:26:10,976 --> 01:26:12,455
Id like to come visit.

1121
01:26:13,212 --> 01:26:16,261
Md I¡¯m sorry we didn¡¯t in the pest.

1122
01:26:18,055 --> 01:26:21,730
I just thought you were angry with me
for taking Gerry away.

1123
01:26:21,772 --> 01:26:23,137
She wanted you dead, you know.

1124
01:26:23,257 --> 01:26:26,499
¡ª Martin, don¡¯t you dare!
¡ª No, I don¡¯t blame you.

1125
01:26:27,178 --> 01:26:30,818
You know, my mother,
she never quite got over the ides either.

1126
01:26:30,928 --> 01:26:34,546
Yeah, well, you were both so young
and it happened too fast.

1127
01:26:37,179 --> 01:26:41,183
But Gerry loved you. I saw that.

1128
01:26:42,539 --> 01:26:43,779
Isaw that.

1129
01:26:50,539 --> 01:26:51,824
To my Gaiway Girl,

1130
01:26:52,366 --> 01:26:53,902
You¡¯re an angel for seeing my folks.

1131
01:26:53,976 --> 01:26:55,705
I told you my mom didn¡¯t hate your guts.

1132
01:26:56,367 --> 01:26:58,221
Well, you know, not anymore.

1133
01:26:59,415 --> 01:27:02,828
You are now standing in my fort
where I did all my big thinking.

1134
01:27:04,212 --> 01:27:09,502
This is where I stood thinking about you,
after the very first time we met.

1135
01:27:18,933 --> 01:27:21,379
You didnt look real to me at first.

1136
01:27:21,493 --> 01:27:24,826
I never saw so many colors
on one girl before,

1137
01:27:25,057 --> 01:27:27,298
but you looked like yoo belonged out there,
all right.

1138
01:27:27,447 --> 01:27:29,620
You and all your colors.

1139
01:27:30,338 --> 01:27:33,546
Do you remember the first thing
you ever said to me?

1140
01:27:33,977 --> 01:27:35,012
Tm lost.

1141
01:27:35,339 --> 01:27:38,661
Oh, you didn¡¯t look lost, not to me.

1142
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:40,777
So, what are you looking for oot here?

1143
01:27:41,292 --> 01:27:44,090
Wicklow Mountains National Park?

1144
01:27:45,571 --> 01:27:47,823
Wicklow Mountains National Park.

1145
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:51,222
¡ª Tell me, how long you¡¯ve been walking for?
¡ª A few hours.

1146
01:27:51,368 --> 01:27:55,498
Well, you¡¯ve probably been
in the National Park for a yew hours, then.

1147
01:27:55,650 --> 01:27:59,416
Oh, my God. This isa park?

1148
01:28:04,289 --> 01:28:07,907
It¡¯s so cold!
The paper said it was gonna be warm.

1149
01:28:08,182 --> 01:28:09,137
It is warm!

1150
01:28:09,181 --> 01:28:10,182
I know you¡¯re lost,

1151
01:28:10,338 --> 01:28:12,374
but you do know
you¡¯re in Ireland, don¡¯t you?

1152
01:28:14,011 --> 01:28:16,662
Well, I better heed back.

1153
01:28:17,542 --> 01:28:18,702
Md where is that?

1154
01:28:19,372 --> 01:28:23,991
Tm staying at a B&B in Dun¡ªlouga¡ªhairy.

1155
01:28:24,020 --> 01:28:25,499
Dunlagohairy?

1156
01:28:25,573 --> 01:28:27,621
No, I think you mean Dun Laoghaire.

1157
01:28:28,544 --> 01:28:29,988
¡ª Youre kidding?
¡ª No.

1158
01:28:30,417 --> 01:28:31,623
Would I lie to you?

1159
01:28:33,261 --> 01:28:35,980
¡ª Dun Laoghaire?
¡ª Dun Laoghaire.

1160
01:28:38,728 --> 01:28:42,425
¡ª Okay. Thanks.
¡ª Oh, you¡¯re grand.

1161
01:28:44,650 --> 01:28:46,550
But youre going the wrong way, you know.

1162
01:28:52,616 --> 01:28:54,937
That way? Okay.

1163
01:28:55,929 --> 01:28:58,853
I think you quite enjoy this getting lost,
don¡¯t yoo?

1164
01:28:59,615 --> 01:29:03,494
You know, actually,
I don¡¯t mind so much, not here.

1165
01:29:04,693 --> 01:29:05,819
So how did you come to be here?

1166
01:29:05,857 --> 01:29:08,451
Oh, on my way home, college trip.

1167
01:29:08,725 --> 01:29:10,181
We started in Greece.

1168
01:29:10,287 --> 01:29:12,983
Jesus, that¡¯s a long walk.
That¡¯s a bad joke.

1169
01:29:13,694 --> 01:29:16,777
¡ª What are you studying?
¡ªArt.

1170
01:29:17,287 --> 01:29:18,140
¡ª Art?
-Yeah.

1171
01:29:18,178 --> 01:29:21,579
¡ª Oh, so you¡¯re an artist then?
¡ª I don¡¯t know yet.

1172
01:29:22,258 --> 01:29:26,581
That¡¯s great. Do you make anything, or...

1173
01:29:28,339 --> 01:29:31,547
¡ª I dont know yet.
¡ª Good luck with that.

1174
01:29:45,651 --> 01:29:49,576
Would you mind if we walk a ways together
since we¡¯re going in the same direction?

1175
01:29:49,823 --> 01:29:52,906
Ill stay on this side of the road.
Dont even have to talk.

1176
01:29:53,010 --> 01:29:58,698
Just, quite nice, you know, sometimes,
walking along with someone without talking,

1177
01:29:58,822 --> 01:30:01,541
once you get your feet wet.

1178
01:30:13,053 --> 01:30:14,827
Of course, the no¡ªtalking thing didn¡¯t last.

1179
01:30:14,896 --> 01:30:16,727
Before long, I couldn¡¯t get you to shut up.

1180
01:30:17,443 --> 01:30:18,444
But you were so cute,

1181
01:30:18,568 --> 01:30:23,540
trying to impress me
with William Blake and all your grand plans.

1182
01:30:23,897 --> 01:30:26,502
I had no idea what you were talking about,

1183
01:30:26,538 --> 01:30:28,859
but I couldn¡¯t help loving
the way you talked.

1184
01:30:28,898 --> 01:30:33,904
Oh, I must create a something

1185
01:30:34,210 --> 01:30:37,657
or be enslaved by another man¡¯s something.

1186
01:30:37,772 --> 01:30:39,569
Wait, twill, twill not...

1187
01:30:42,054 --> 01:30:45,364
Twill not reason or compare.

1188
01:30:45,614 --> 01:30:49,778
My business is to create...something...
Oh, God!

1189
01:30:50,694 --> 01:30:51,695
Did you just make that up then?

1190
01:30:51,819 --> 01:30:53,218
No, it¡¯s William Blake,

1191
01:30:53,368 --> 01:30:55,370
but I completely screwed it up.

1192
01:30:55,540 --> 01:30:57,656
No, you didn¡¯t, you made it better.
I understood it.

1193
01:30:58,212 --> 01:30:59,497
I didnt have a clue, actually.

1194
01:30:59,571 --> 01:31:05,191
il I know is, if you don¡¯t figure out
the something, you¡¯11 just stay ordinary.

1195
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:10,374
Md it doesnt matter if its a work of art
or a taco or a pair of socks!

1196
01:31:10,571 --> 01:31:15,213
Just create something new and there it is.

1197
01:31:15,257 --> 01:31:18,852
Md it¡¯s you, out in the world,
outside of you.

1198
01:31:18,930 --> 01:31:22,457
Md you can look at it or hear it
or read it or feel it

1199
01:31:22,571 --> 01:31:25,734
and you know a little bit more about you.

1200
01:31:25,852 --> 01:31:27,547
A little bit more than anybody else does.

1201
01:31:29,009 --> 01:31:32,934
¡ª Does that make any sense at all?
¡ªYeah.

1202
01:31:34,492 --> 01:31:36,414
Youre saying you want to paint socks.

1203
01:31:37,727 --> 01:31:38,785
Maybe!

1204
01:31:40,445 --> 01:31:42,549
I loved you right then and there.

1205
01:31:53,534 --> 01:31:55,183
Hey, I like this jacket.

1206
01:31:57,253 --> 01:31:59,574
It looks good on you. Got it on a bet.

1207
01:31:59,770 --> 01:32:00,976
What was the bet?

1208
01:32:02,050 --> 01:32:05,133
Well, mind you, I was a few Guinnesses
for the worse at this point,

1209
01:32:05,206 --> 01:32:06,491
but a fella bet me

1210
01:32:06,645 --> 01:32:10,263
that I couldn¡¯t get a certain girl
to kiss me without a provocation.

1211
01:32:10,692 --> 01:32:13,388
¡ª What girl?
¡ª His girl.

1212
01:32:15,380 --> 01:32:17,928
¡ª How did you do it?
¡ª Theres nothing to it, really.

1213
01:32:18,489 --> 01:32:22,266
A fella just has to tell a woman the truth
without words.

1214
01:32:22,694 --> 01:32:24,901
Its like a signal you send out.

1215
01:32:25,741 --> 01:32:27,459
The woman, she just picks it up.

1216
01:32:28,646 --> 01:32:29,931
Md what¡¯s the truth?

1217
01:32:32,179 --> 01:32:35,342
That kissing her would be the end of life
as I know it.

1218
01:32:40,051 --> 01:32:43,851
Md thats true
of every girl youve gotten to kiss you?

1219
01:32:45,615 --> 01:32:48,857
Well, I could turn it on and off
when I was younger and I had no principles.

1220
01:32:48,926 --> 01:32:53,101
When every girl that I was lucky enough
to kiss was the end of life as Iknewit.

1221
01:32:56,740 --> 01:32:57,820
Md now?

1222
01:33:00,457 --> 01:33:04,291
Now I only send it out when I think
she might be the one that makes it true.

1223
01:33:14,410 --> 01:33:15,820
I know where I am now!

1224
01:33:15,858 --> 01:33:17,849
Thanks it was really nice to meet you!

1225
01:33:17,926 --> 01:33:19,848
¡ª No, I could walk you into town.
¡ª Oh, no, it¡¯s okay!

1226
01:33:19,973 --> 01:33:21,975
I know where Jam, I know where I¡¯m going.

1227
01:33:27,534 --> 01:33:29,024
I¡¯ll never forget this.

1228
01:33:33,737 --> 01:33:35,329
Oh, your jacket.

1229
01:33:38,844 --> 01:33:42,018
No, wait! Oh, wait, wait, don¡¯t move.

1230
01:33:42,283 --> 01:33:42,817
What?

1231
01:33:42,855 --> 01:33:45,824
¡ª Oh, yeah, it¡¯s a wild Irish dog.
¡ªA what?

1232
01:33:47,567 --> 01:33:48,932
¡ª You have to stand still.
¡ªOkay.

1233
01:33:49,566 --> 01:33:53,218
Get close, like one person.

1234
01:33:53,818 --> 01:33:55,058
Now if we sepsrate,

1235
01:33:55,207 --> 01:33:59,621
hell feel threatened
and attack our vital parts.

1236
01:33:59,655 --> 01:34:02,419
What vital parts? All my parts are vital!

1237
01:34:05,254 --> 01:34:10,339
We have to stand still.
Now, just let him sniff around a bit.

1238
01:34:12,381 --> 01:34:13,746
Now wait.

1239
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:26,615
Tm really scared.
Would you put your arms around me?

1240
01:34:27,020 --> 01:34:28,214
WI right.

1241
01:34:28,489 --> 01:34:31,208
¡ª Yeah, that¡¯s probably a good idea.
¡ªYeah.

1242
01:34:32,972 --> 01:34:36,294
Do you think we could turn aroond and
face each other withoot freaking him out?

1243
01:34:39,097 --> 01:34:41,179
Okay. Sure.

1244
01:34:42,174 --> 01:34:45,211
¡ª But lets move very slowly, okay?
¡ªOkay.

1245
01:34:52,124 --> 01:34:55,616
Oh, sorry! I haven¡¯t done this in a while.

1246
01:34:55,657 --> 01:34:58,057
I¡¯ve been seeing this boy, Timmy,
but we don¡¯t do much.

1247
01:34:58,126 --> 01:35:00,378
I don¡¯t know why. Maybe it¡¯s me.

1248
01:35:00,455 --> 01:35:02,207
No, he¡¯s a boy who...

1249
01:35:04,690 --> 01:35:06,612
doesnt know anything about kissing.

1250
01:35:08,377 --> 01:35:11,540
¡ª Thats a mans business.
¡ª Is it?

1251
01:35:34,768 --> 01:35:41,185
That was the most perfect,
perfect first kiss.

1252
01:35:42,972 --> 01:35:44,462
That was the second.

1253
01:35:45,567 --> 01:35:47,285
This is the third.

1254
01:36:10,015 --> 01:36:11,209
Brady, come!

1255
01:36:12,281 --> 01:36:15,330
¡ªHey,Gerry.
¡ª How are you, Jeff?

1256
01:36:18,283 --> 01:36:21,696
¡ª Hey, where you going?
¡ª No, stay! Stay!

1257

01:36:27,692 --> 01:36:29,023
Ibet we do.

1260
01:36:29,208 --> 01:36:31,176
Well, that¡¯s a bet you¡¯re gonna have to win
because if...

1261
01:36:31,535 --> 01:36:34,823
if we do meet again,
then that¡¯Il be the end of it, you know.

1262
01:36:35,926 --> 01:36:38,747
¡ª The end of what?
¡ª Life as we know it.

1263
01:36:41,207 --> 01:36:44,108
¡ª Look, I¡¯m singing at this pub...
¡ª No, no, no, no, no, no!

1264
01:36:44,206 --> 01:36:47,334
Don¡¯t tell me. If I happen to walk
into the right one, in the right town,

1265
01:36:47,487 --> 01:36:49,660
then we¡¯ll know for sure, won¡¯t we?

1266
01:36:49,768 --> 01:36:51,133
Md itt don¡¯t,

1267
01:36:51,252 --> 01:36:55,177

ever created by two strangers

1268
01:36:55,250 --> 01:36:58,026
and well just keep it perfect
for the rest of our lives.

1269
01:36:58,846 --> 01:37:01,622
¡ª What¡¯s your name?
¡ª No, no! Wait, no, don¡¯t, don¡¯t.

1270
01:37:07,971 --> 01:37:10,098
Life had changed as I knew it.

1271
01:37:10,892 --> 01:37:12,974
Md now it¡¯s changed again, luv.

1272
01:37:13,816 --> 01:37:16,774
See, I don¡¯t worry about you remembering me.

1273
01:37:16,847 --> 01:37:19,623

1282
01:38:01,972 --> 01:38:03,542
Hey, where are you? Call me.

1283
01:38:03,692 --> 01:38:04,647
You havent returned any of my calls.

1284
01:38:04,739 --> 01:38:06,775
I want you to come
to my first baby doctors appointment.

1285
01:38:06,849 --> 01:38:07,702
What is going on?

1286
01:38:07,819 --> 01:38:10,026
Nobody¡¯s heard from you, my maid of honor!

¡ªCalime!
¡ªCalime!

01:38:11,257 --> 01:38:15,978
If you need to find any job to get by,
be realistic, Iuv, all right?

1289
01:38:16,054 --> 01:38:18,102
I cannot believe
you are not calling me back!

1290
01:38:18,179 --> 01:38:19,464
You cant be a secret agent,

1291
01:38:20,101 --> 01:38:22,467
and theres no such thing
as a vampire slayer.

1292
01:38:22,537 --> 01:38:23,936
¡ª Tm getting married.
¡ª Pick up the phone!

1293
01:38:24,022 --> 01:38:24,750
Where are you?

01:38:24,819 --> 01:38:26,411
Call me.
His death is a part of your life now.

1295
01:38:26,458 --> 01:38:27,664
Jam so mad at you!

1296
01:38:31,660 --> 01:38:33,184
Shed be much more interesting
if she wouldnt hold us up.

1297
01:38:33,848 --> 01:38:34,746
Here she is.

1298
01:38:48,532 --> 01:38:49,772
Great shoes.

1299
01:38:57,049 --> 01:38:59,097
Okay, this message is for Holly Kennedy.

1300
01:38:59,282 --> 01:39:02,536
Please tell her her friend Denise
is getting married December 31st

1301
01:39:02,611 --> 01:39:03,930
and she¡¯s not invited.

1302
01:39:04,128 --> 01:39:06,494
Okay? How about that? You¡¯re not invited.

1303
01:40:42,894 --> 01:40:44,976
¡ª Look at this.
¡ª It needs to be tighter!

1304
01:40:45,019 --> 01:40:50,127
mu right, Twill do whatever you want,
but I¡¯m not so sure, I mean, I¡¯m think...

1305
01:40:50,251 --> 01:40:53,778
No, listen,
your bust looks absolutely right,

1306
01:40:53,846 --> 01:40:56,098
because let me tell you something,
you don¡¯t want to look too busty.

1307
01:40:56,173 --> 01:41:00,291
Yeah, well, see, although, you know,
my breasts are beautiful and firm

1308
01:41:00,406 --> 01:41:02,488
they do often have a mind 0f their own

1309
01:41:02,610 --> 01:41:06,023
and they can go off in different directions
without adult supewision.

1310
01:41:06,174 --> 01:41:09,814
So could you please just take it in
a quarter¡ªinch? Just a quarter¡ªinch.

1311
01:41:09,893 --> 01:41:10,769
¡ªOkay.
¡ªOkay.

1312
01:41:16,893 --> 01:41:20,420
Could you give us,
excuse us fore minute, please?

1313
01:41:20,692 --> 01:41:21,693
¡ª Sure.
¡ªThanks.

1314
01:41:28,331 --> 01:41:29,821
You look beautiful.

1315
01:41:30,847 --> 01:41:32,621
Well, I could¡¯ve used some help.

1316
01:41:32,846 --> 01:41:37,340
This is the 12th dress I¡¯ve tried on. So...

1317
01:41:39,173 --> 01:41:40,379
I¡¯m sorry.

1318
01:41:41,455 --> 01:41:42,934
Well, you were supposed to be
my maid of honor,

1319
01:41:43,017 --> 01:41:44,700
but of course I didn¡¯t hear from you.

1320
01:41:46,971 --> 01:41:49,622
Sharon feels too conspicuous
since she¡¯s popped.

1321
01:41:49,767 --> 01:41:53,567
So, guess what?
I had to ask Tom¡¯s 51¡ªyear¡ªold sister

1322
01:41:53,847 --> 01:41:56,259
who looks like Jerry Springer
and doesn¡¯t like me.

1323
01:41:58,205 --> 01:42:01,538
PJI because my best friend
couldnt stand me being so happy.

1324
01:42:02,736 --> 01:42:04,055
Why? Why is that?

1325
01:42:04,329 --> 01:42:05,455
Because our lives were moving on

1326
01:42:05,565 --> 01:42:08,022
and you werent
the center of attention anymore?

1327
01:42:08,613 --> 01:42:10,410
¡ªYes.
¡ªReally?

1328
01:42:10,534 --> 01:42:12,695
¡ª It was awful and I¡¯m really sorry.
¡ª Oh, no, I¡¯m sorry, honey.

1329
01:42:12,816 --> 01:42:15,023
¡ª Oh, I¡¯m so sorry.
¡ª I¡¯m sorry.

1330
01:42:15,097 --> 01:42:16,212
You were right and I was wrong.

1331
01:42:16,285 --> 01:42:19,539
God, I¡¯m such a bitch! I¡¯m sorry!
I was so crazy mad.

1332
01:42:19,691 --> 01:42:21,420
I hope you can forgive me.

1333
01:42:21,770 --> 01:42:23,465
Oh, you know what, it¡¯s not too late.

1334
01:42:23,612 --> 01:42:25,694
You can still be a bridesmaid with Sharon.

1335
01:42:26,253 --> 01:42:27,333
¡ªOkay.
¡ªOkay?

1336
01:42:28,971 --> 01:42:30,211
Can Task you a favor?

1337
01:42:32,252 --> 01:42:35,130
¡ª I want to make your wedding shoes.
¡ª My shoes?

1338
01:42:35,378 --> 01:42:36,982
What, did you turn into Geppetto?

1339
01:42:37,378 --> 01:42:40,131
Oh, my God! These are gorgeous!

1340
01:42:40,253 --> 01:42:43,381
I¡¯ve been taking a class.
It just happened out of the blue.

1341
01:42:43,566 --> 01:42:44,851
I really love it.

1342
01:42:45,019 --> 01:42:46,418
Oh, my God!

1343
01:42:47,206 --> 01:42:47,934
They¡¯re one of a kind.

1344
01:42:48,098 --> 01:42:51,135
You¡¯ll be the only bride
in the history 0f the world to wear them.

1345
01:42:51,283 --> 01:42:52,284
Love that!

1346
01:42:53,738 --> 01:42:57,822
Oh, God, Holly! This is like shoe art.

1347
01:42:57,973 --> 01:43:02,023
They¡¯re gorgeous!
We have to show these to ovmeone.

1348
01:43:11,288 --> 01:43:13,700
I feel like Gerry¡¯s guiding me.

1349
01:43:13,804 --> 01:43:17,422
I mean, shoes!
I love shoes, butt never thought about it.

1350
01:43:17,524 --> 01:43:20,140
¡ª You look so great.
¡ªThanks.

1351
01:43:20,446 --> 01:43:22,573
¡ª Course, I look great too, right?
-Yes.

1352
01:43:23,367 --> 01:43:26,621
When all this started happening,
you¡¯re the first person I wanted to tell.

1353
01:43:27,165 --> 01:43:29,247
¡ª Isnt that funny?
¡ª Thats hilarious.

1354
01:43:29,368 --> 01:43:31,984
My way we can stretch this lunch out
into a dinner?

1355
01:43:32,978 --> 01:43:34,855
Tm gonna change the subject.

1356
01:43:36,492 --> 01:43:39,416
¡ª How are you?
¡ª Tm good. Things are good.

1357
01:43:39,571 --> 01:43:44,577
Joe got some, some ideas for the future,
some possible business prospects.

1358
01:43:44,649 --> 01:43:46,731
I think about you all the time.

1359
01:43:49,055 --> 01:43:50,704
That¡¯s a little too much information,
Iguess.

1360
01:43:50,804 --> 01:43:51,930
Yes.

1361
01:43:51,977 --> 01:43:54,650
But you did say you were thinking about me.

1362
01:43:54,728 --> 01:43:57,652
Because you¡¯ve been a real friend
through this all.

1363
01:43:58,337 --> 01:44:01,886
So you haven¡¯t thought about me in the nude?

1364
01:44:02,447 --> 01:44:03,618
No.

1365
01:44:04,213 --> 01:44:05,578
¡ª Not once?
¡ª No.

1366
01:44:05,650 --> 01:44:07,891
¡ª Not even without my shirt?
¡ª Gerry, stop it!

1367
01:44:09,978 --> 01:44:11,093
Daniel.

1368
01:44:17,010 --> 01:44:18,295

Sorry.

1370
01:44:25,886 --> 01:44:28,172
You think youre ever gonna feel about
somebody else the way you felt about Gerry

1371
01:44:28,261 --> 01:44:30,980
or do you have to wait
for one of your letters to figure that out?

1372
01:44:34,167 --> 01:44:35,452
Where are yoo going?

1373
01:44:40,417 --> 01:44:46,299
I really like you,
but I cant be the invisible man.

1374
01:44:47,165 --> 01:44:49,941
Tm tired 0f being the shoulder.

1375
01:44:51,697 --> 01:44:55,019
I want to be another body part you need,
you know?

1376
01:44:55,087 --> 01:44:59,217
I wanna be the bad guy.
I want a woman to go crazy over me

1377
01:44:59,289 --> 01:45:04,135
and then I wanna use her up
until shes ruined for all nther men.

1378
01:45:04,209 --> 01:45:04,891
You dont want tn do that.

1379
01:45:05,006 --> 01:45:07,850
No, I don¡¯t want to do that, but I would...

1380
01:45:10,522 --> 01:45:14,288
I¡¯d like to date a woman
who actually likes men.

1381
01:45:21,052 --> 01:45:23,134
Id like to be somebodys Gerry.

1382
01:45:33,976 --> 01:45:38,094
Its all right.
Honestly, its not your fault, its mine.

1383
01:45:40,618 --> 01:45:43,269
I didn¡¯t really plan on feeling something
for you, it just sort of happened.

1384
01:45:43,368 --> 01:45:44,892
So I¡¯m sorry about that.

1385
01:45:54,209 --> 01:45:57,656
¡ª Is your guest coming back?
¡ª No.

1386
01:45:57,975 --> 01:45:59,977
Just you on your own, then?

1387
01:47:27,284 --> 01:47:28,649
Take a break, will you?

1388
01:47:30,160 --> 01:47:32,412
¡ª Mum!
¡ª Whets the matter?

1389
01:47:40,724 --> 01:47:43,420
Come on. Come here.

1390
01:47:45,208 --> 01:47:46,345
What happened?

1391
01:47:49,523 --> 01:47:54,267
When Daddy left, I was 14 and I said...

1392
01:47:55,335 --> 01:47:59,214
that¡¯s it, never again. No man.

1393
01:48:01,448 --> 01:48:03,063
Md then I meet Gerry.

1394
01:48:08,290 --> 01:48:14,650
This wonderful men happens to me
and then, and then he died!

1395
01:48:15,288 --> 01:48:16,983
¡ª What was the point?
¡ª I know, honey.

1396
01:48:17,053 --> 01:48:19,886
Tm so angry I could kill somebody!

1397
01:48:19,975 --> 01:48:21,886
Tm alone and...

1398
01:48:22,412 --> 01:48:24,141
it doesnt matter what job I have

1399
01:48:24,256 --> 01:48:26,258
or what I do or what I dont do

1400
01:48:26,335 --> 01:48:27,620
or what friends I have.

1401
01:48:27,772 --> 01:48:28,625
Hes not here.

1402
01:48:28,656 --> 01:48:31,295
Tm not here.

1403
01:48:32,852 --> 01:48:35,696
¡ª I mean, you¡¯re alone no matter what!
¡ª That¡¯s right.

1404
01:48:39,366 --> 01:48:43,621
You know, I didn¡¯t come here for you
to give me some bulishit honest answer.

1405
01:48:43,693 --> 01:48:47,572
¡ª Why cant you lie to me just once?
¡ª Tm so sorry, sweetheart.

1406
01:48:53,003 --> 01:48:56,291
I cant breathe. I can¡¯t breathe.

1407
01:48:56,442 --> 01:49:00,162
Come on, lets go for a walk.

1408
01:49:02,927 --> 01:49:05,088
Your father and I used to come here.

1409
01:49:05,209 --> 01:49:08,656
They had dances. Well, not really dances.

1410
01:49:08,725 --> 01:49:11,091
Wed come with radios and cigarettes

1411
01:49:11,210 --> 01:49:13,986
and drink beer and listen to Jimi Hendrio.

1412
01:49:17,411 --> 01:49:21,211
I bet you¡¯ve had a hard time walking into
a room full of people on your own, right?

1413
01:49:22,521 --> 01:49:23,977
Yeah, I know that.

1414
01:49:25,256 --> 01:49:28,805
I know what it is not to feel like
you¡¯re in the room until he looks at you

1415
01:49:29,694 --> 01:49:33,858
or touches your hand
or even makes a joke at your expense,

1416
01:49:34,493 --> 01:49:36,939
just to let everyone know you¡¯re with him.

1417
01:49:38,009 --> 01:49:39,340
You¡¯re his.

1418
01:49:41,336 --> 01:49:43,702
God, that man could make me laugh.

1419
01:49:45,086 --> 01:49:46,087
Daddy?

1420
01:49:48,853 --> 01:49:50,855
I dont ever remember you laughing.

1421
01:49:54,771 --> 01:49:57,365
Well, that makes me sad.

1422
01:50:01,006 --> 01:50:02,416
Because I did.

1423
01:50:05,648 --> 01:50:06,808
Idid.

1424
01:50:12,927 --> 01:50:15,725
Did you hate Gerry
because he reminded you of Dad?

1425
01:50:18,162 --> 01:50:19,265
A little.

1426
01:50:24,770 --> 01:50:29,139
You know the worst thing for a parent,
second after losing a child?

1427
01:50:30,849 --> 01:50:34,091
Watching your child
head for the same life you had

1428
01:50:35,521 --> 01:50:37,057
and you cant stop it.

1429
01:50:40,522 --> 01:50:43,093
It¡¯s a terrible, helpless feeling.

1430
01:50:44,882 --> 01:50:46,577
Makes you angry all the time,

1431
01:50:48,615 --> 01:50:53,336
and I¡¯ve been angry a very long time.

1432
01:50:57,085 --> 01:50:58,495
I¡¯m exhausted.

1433
01:51:03,414 --> 01:51:05,530
Do you think we¡¯ll ever see Dad again?

1434
01:51:07,007 --> 01:51:08,929
No, sweetheart.

1435
01:51:10,086 --> 01:51:11,417
Never.

1436
01:51:15,368 --> 01:51:17,575
So you have to stop waiting.

1437
01:51:42,334 --> 01:51:43,574
You?

1438
01:51:46,052 --> 01:51:50,170
I have to sayl was impressed by how
he worked everything out ahead of time,

1439
01:51:51,364 --> 01:51:54,527
every delivery schedule, the mailbox key.

1440
01:51:55,879 --> 01:51:58,256
Getting that leather jacket
out of your apartment wasn¡¯t easy

1441
01:51:58,333 --> 01:52:00,733
with you acting like Miss Havisham.

1442
01:52:05,615 --> 01:52:09,733
He made me promise. I couldnt say no.

1443
01:52:10,613 --> 01:52:14,879
I told him I didnt think
it was good for you, but...

1444
01:52:15,693 --> 01:52:17,172
I couldn¡¯t say no.

1445
01:52:21,613 --> 01:52:22,932
It¡¯s the last one.

1446
01:52:25,614 --> 01:52:33,055
So, now alone or not, you gotta walk ahead.

1447
01:52:38,489 --> 01:52:39,933
Thing to remember is

1448
01:52:41,161 --> 01:52:42,810
if we¡¯re all alone,

1449
01:52:43,694 --> 01:52:45,980
then were all together in that too.

1450
01:52:49,132 --> 01:52:51,134
It helps me sometimes.

1451
01:53:53,923 --> 01:53:56,653
Hi, its Daniel.

1452
01:53:56,768 --> 01:53:58,724
Remember what I said in the restaurant?

1453
01:53:58,847 --> 01:54:00,906
Please forget it word by word.

1454
01:54:02,364 --> 01:54:04,161
They¡¯re gonna build a new Yankee stadium.

1455
01:54:05,365 --> 01:54:06,297
I dont know why I said that.

1456
01:54:06,412 --> 01:54:08,414
Tm making small talk. I hate small talk.

1457
01:54:09,055 --> 01:54:12,263
I hate the people who make small talk.
I should, I should stop.

1458
01:54:12,368 --> 01:54:14,575
I¡¯m stopping. Shit!

1459
01:54:26,365 --> 01:54:27,775
Gerry?

1460
01:54:33,363 --> 01:54:36,059
My uncle can get us in anytime we want.

1461
01:54:37,004 --> 01:54:38,699
He turned the lights on for us.

1462
01:54:41,770 --> 01:54:43,135
Its amazing.

1463
01:55:11,364 --> 01:55:12,626
You sure?

1464
01:55:14,648 --> 01:55:15,649
Its okay.

1465
01:55:24,211 --> 01:55:27,408
¡®Dear Holly, I don¡¯t have much time.

1466
01:55:27,930 --> 01:55:29,249
I don¡¯t mean literally,

1467
01:55:29,320 --> 01:55:32,483
I mean, you¡¯re out buying ice cream
and you¡¯ll be home soon,

1468
01:55:33,212 --> 01:55:35,248
but I haoe a feeling
this is the last letter.

1469
01:55:35,447 --> 01:55:38,041
Because there¡¯s only one thing left
to tell you.

1470
01:55:38,886 --> 01:55:42,014
It isn¡¯t to go down memory lane
or make you buy a lamp.

1471
01:55:42,090 --> 01:55:45,048
You can take care of yourself
without any help from me.

1472
01:55:46,763 --> 01:55:49,379
Its to tell you how much you move me.

1473
01:55:49,732 --> 01:55:51,302
How you changed me.

1474
01:55:52,170 --> 01:55:55,333
You made me a man by loving me, Holly,

1475
01:55:55,450 --> 01:55:58,294
and for that Jam eternally grateful.

1476
01:55:59,372 --> 01:56:00,691
Literally.

1477
01:56:02,044 --> 01:56:03,773
If you can promise me anything,

1478
01:56:03,857 --> 01:56:07,657
promise me that whenever youre sad
or unsure,

1479
01:56:08,686 --> 01:56:10,893
or you lose complete faith,

1480
01:56:11,858 --> 01:56:14,736
that youll try and see yourself
through my eyes.

1481
01:56:15,294 --> 01:56:18,127
Thank you for the honor of being my wife.

1482
01:56:18,371 --> 01:56:20,578
Tm a man with no regrets.

1483
01:56:21,011 --> 01:56:22,535
How Iud am 1?

1484
01:56:23,652 --> 01:56:25,734
You made my life, Holly,

1485
01:56:25,934 --> 01:56:28,585
but I¡¯m just one chapter in yours.

1486
01:56:28,762 --> 01:56:32,300
There¡¯ll be more. I promise.

1487
01:56:33,528 --> 01:56:36,861
So, here it comes, the bit one.

1488
01:56:38,528 --> 01:56:40,940
Don¡¯t be afraid to fall in love again.

1489
01:56:42,292 --> 01:56:45,819
Watch out for that signal
when life as you know it ends.

1490
01:56:48,215 --> 01:56:52,811
P.S., twill always love you.¡¯

1491
01:57:13,365 --> 01:57:15,094
Have you thought about this?

1492
01:57:16,930 --> 01:57:18,454
About me, I mean?

1493
01:57:20,853 --> 01:57:22,480
Have you?

1494
01:57:26,010 --> 01:57:27,170
Yeah.

1495
01:57:53,572 --> 01:57:54,448
This isn¡¯t going to work, is it?

1496
01:57:54,605 --> 01:57:55,970
¡ª No way, no how!
¡ª Damn!

1497
01:58:01,119 --> 01:58:03,690
I mean, that was like kissing my sister!

1498
01:58:03,808 --> 01:58:04,968
I¡¯m so relieved!

1499
01:58:06,729 --> 01:58:09,573
I got this letter and I thought he must have
been feeling all self¡ªsacrificing and...

1500
01:58:10,292 --> 01:58:11,327
but hes really full of crap,

1501
01:58:11,448 --> 01:58:13,689
but if he really meant it,
he¡¯d give me a sign and then...

1502
01:58:13,808 --> 01:58:15,617
¡ª I hate signs.
¡ª I got your message on the machine.

1503
01:58:23,170 --> 01:58:26,219
Weird, bitter friends?

1504
01:58:27,764 --> 01:58:29,015
Forever.

1505
01:58:41,855 --> 01:58:45,689
¡ª Whets wrong, friend?
¡ª It¡¯s Gerry.

1506
01:58:47,685 --> 01:58:49,937
It¡¯s been a year...

1507
01:58:51,684 --> 01:58:54,608
and I don¡¯t feel him around me anymore.

1508
01:58:56,573 --> 01:58:58,768
I don¡¯t think he¡¯s here anymore.

1509
01:59:01,291 --> 01:59:06,536
I think Gerrys gone. Hes really gone.

1510
01:59:26,121 --> 01:59:29,966
Dear Gerry, you said you wanted me
to fall in love again

1511
01:59:30,089 --> 01:59:31,943
and maybe one day I will,

1512
01:59:32,496 --> 01:59:34,817
but there are all kinds of love out there.

1513
01:59:35,966 --> 01:59:37,763
This is my one and only life

1514
01:59:37,965 --> 01:59:41,503
and its a great and terrible
and short and endless thing

1515
01:59:41,888 --> 01:59:43,822
and none of us come out of it alive.

1516
01:59:54,325 --> 01:59:58,694
I dont have a plan except that
it¡¯s time my mum laughed again.

1517
01:59:59,293 --> 02:00:00,965
Shes never seen the world.

1518
02:00:01,215 --> 02:00:02,967
Shes never seen Ireland,

1519
02:00:03,730 --> 02:00:06,483
so Fm taking her beck to where we started.

1520
02:00:13,574 --> 02:00:15,576
Maybe now shell understand.

1521
02:00:24,449 --> 02:00:25,609
Mum?

1522
02:00:41,246 --> 02:00:45,501
¡ª William.
¡ª Hello, you!

1523
02:00:48,448 --> 02:00:50,120
You back for another visit?

1524
02:00:51,573 --> 02:00:54,656
¡ªHow long?
¡ªIdont know.

1525
02:00:57,761 --> 02:01:00,332
Oh, this is my mum, Patricia.

1526
02:01:00,572 --> 02:01:02,608
Hello. This is me father, Patsy.

1527
02:01:06,446 --> 02:01:08,016
Youve dropped your sweets, Ion.

1528
02:01:08,571 --> 02:01:10,175
Mustnt do that around these parts.

1529
02:01:10,651 --> 02:01:13,859
Pretty woman like you,
a fella could take it the wrong way.
