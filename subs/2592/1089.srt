1
00:04:16,237 --> 00:04:17,636
Doug?

2
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,274
Honey, are you all right?

3
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:25,775
You're dreaming.

4
00:04:26,215 --> 00:04:30,012
Doug, was it about Mars?

5
00:04:36,057 --> 00:04:37,649
Is that better?

6
00:04:40,528 --> 00:04:41,995
My poor baby.

7
00:04:42,964 --> 00:04:45,364
This is getting to be an obsession.

8
00:04:53,874 --> 00:04:55,000
Was she there?

9
00:04:57,144 --> 00:04:58,543
Who?

10
00:05:00,715 --> 00:05:03,411
The one you told me about.
the brunette.

11
00:05:04,752 --> 00:05:05,878
Lori.

12
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:11,756
I can't believe
you're jealous of a dream.

13
00:05:12,626 --> 00:05:15,390
- Who is she?
- Nobody.

14
00:05:15,596 --> 00:05:17,689
'Nobody'? What's her name?

15
00:05:17,832 --> 00:05:19,060
I don't know.

16
00:05:20,601 --> 00:05:22,091
- Tell me!
- I don't know!

17
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,631
You better tell me!

18
00:05:24,772 --> 00:05:28,469
It's not funny, Doug.
You dream about her every night.

19
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:30,710
And I'm always back in the morning.

20
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,741
Let me go!

21
00:05:35,282 --> 00:05:37,477
Come on, baby.

22
00:05:37,618 --> 00:05:40,519
You know you're the girl of my dreams.

23
00:05:40,721 --> 00:05:42,188
You mean it?

24
00:05:43,557 --> 00:05:45,354
You know I do.

25
00:05:54,835 --> 00:05:57,633
I'll give you something to dream about.

26
00:06:07,448 --> 00:06:11,009
The chairman defended the attack,
saying that space-based weapons...

27
00:06:11,185 --> 00:06:15,089
are our only effective defense against the
southern block's numerical superiority.

28
00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:17,759
And more violence
last night on Mars...

29
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,193
where terrorists
demanding independence...

30
00:06:20,194 --> 00:06:23,493
once again halted the extraction
of terbinium ore.

31
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:30,662
Kuato and his so-called
freedom brigade...

32
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:32,903
claimed credit for this latest bombing,

33
00:06:33,274 --> 00:06:36,437
which attempted to reopen
the sealed-off Pyramid Mines.

34
00:06:39,947 --> 00:06:43,351
Mars military restored order
with minimal use of force...

35
00:06:43,351 --> 00:06:47,014
and all damage to the strategic facility
was repaired within hours.

36
00:06:47,455 --> 00:06:48,752
No cameras!

37
00:06:48,923 --> 00:06:52,916
With one mine already closed,
mars administrator Vilos Cohaagen...

38
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,255
vowed that troops
would be used if necessary...

39
00:06:55,363 --> 00:06:58,958
to keep production at full capacity.
At the press conference today

40
00:06:59,066 --> 00:07:02,331
No wonder you're having nightmares.
you're always watching the news.

41
00:07:06,974 --> 00:07:09,272
- Lori.
- Doug?

42
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,641
- Let's do it.
- Do what?

43
00:07:12,814 --> 00:07:14,213
Move to Mars.

44
00:07:15,383 --> 00:07:18,580
Honey, why do you have to spoil
a perfectly wonderful morning?

45
00:07:20,388 --> 00:07:21,685
Just think about it.

46
00:07:24,025 --> 00:07:27,426
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.
You'd hate it on Mars.

47
00:07:27,595 --> 00:07:30,325
It's dry, it's ugly, it's boring.

48
00:07:31,532 --> 00:07:35,559
I mean, really, a revolution
could break out there any second.

49
00:07:35,736 --> 00:07:37,533
Cohaagen says
it's just a few extremists.

50
00:07:38,873 --> 00:07:40,272
You believe him?

51
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,575
Okay. Forget about it.

52
00:07:51,452 --> 00:07:55,786
Absolutely not. Mars was colonized by
the northern block at enormous expense.

53
00:07:55,923 --> 00:07:59,518
Our entire war effort
depends on their terbinium.

54
00:07:59,627 --> 00:08:01,863
And it's ridiculous to think
we're going to give it away...

55
00:08:01,863 --> 00:08:04,000
just because a bunch of lazy mutants
think they own the planet.

56
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,833
- Doug, Maybe we should take a trip, hum?
- Any comments, sir, on the rumor

57
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,968
- Lori, move.
- that you've blown the Pyramid Mine...

58
00:08:12,173 --> 00:08:13,970
because you found alien artifacts inside?

59
00:08:14,175 --> 00:08:17,042
There's a lot better places here than Mars.

60
00:08:17,378 --> 00:08:19,972
What about Saturn?
don't you wanna see Saturn?

61
00:08:20,114 --> 00:08:23,914
I wish we could find some alien artifacts.
our tourist industry could use a boost.

62
00:08:24,385 --> 00:08:26,751
Everybody says that its gorgeous.

63
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:30,380
But the fact is, it's Mr. Kuato and his
terrorists who spread these rumors...

64
00:08:30,588 --> 00:08:32,057
to undermine my trust in the government.

65
00:08:32,057 --> 00:08:36,794
We could take a long space cruise,
the kind with nothing to do.

66
00:08:36,794 --> 00:08:40,389
- Have you found Kuato yet?
- We don't even know what he looks like.

67
00:08:40,631 --> 00:08:42,622
- What do you say?
- That's all for the news.

68
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,597
- Stay tuned for Christina in the weather.
- I'm late.

69
00:08:44,802 --> 00:08:46,167
But first, this.

70
00:08:47,671 --> 00:08:50,401
- Tonight on ESPN, the fifth game of World Series...
- Sweetheart.

71
00:08:50,401 --> 00:08:51,305
live from Tokyo.

72
00:08:51,305 --> 00:08:59,537
Doug? I know it's hard being in a new town,
but let's give it a chance, okay?

73
00:09:00,578 --> 00:09:05,947
Lori, don't you understand? I feel like
I was made for something more than this.

74
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:10,450
I want to do something with my life,
I want to be somebody.

75
00:09:10,654 --> 00:09:12,519
You are somebody.

76
00:09:12,723 --> 00:09:14,748
You're the man I love.

77
00:09:19,463 --> 00:09:20,760
Bye.

78
00:09:23,467 --> 00:09:25,264
Have a nice day.

79
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:46,754
You are now entering a safety zone.

80
00:09:47,324 --> 00:09:51,556
No unauthorized weapons allowed
beyond this point.

81
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:04,872
Would you like to ski...

82
00:10:05,075 --> 00:10:07,509
but you're snowed under with work?

83
00:10:07,645 --> 00:10:11,547
Do you dream of a vacation
at the bottom of the ocean...

84
00:10:11,749 --> 00:10:13,546
but you can't float the bill?

85
00:10:14,585 --> 00:10:17,884
Have you always wanted
to climb the mountains of Mars...

86
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,581
but now you're over the hill?

87
00:10:22,993 --> 00:10:24,756
Then come to Rekall Incorporated...

88
00:10:24,962 --> 00:10:27,863
where you can buy the memory
of your ideal vacation...

89
00:10:28,098 --> 00:10:30,692
cheaper, safer and better
than the real thing.

90
00:10:30,868 --> 00:10:33,530
So don't let life pass you by.

91
00:10:33,737 --> 00:10:37,138
Call Rekall
for the memory of a lifetime.

92
00:10:37,474 --> 00:10:41,069
For the memory of a lifetime

93
00:10:41,445 --> 00:10:44,710
Rekall, Rekall, Rekall

94
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:04,691
Harry.

95
00:11:08,105 --> 00:11:10,471
- You ever heard of Rekall?
- Rekall?

96
00:11:10,641 --> 00:11:12,438
Where they sell those fake memories.

97
00:11:12,643 --> 00:11:15,940
Oh, Rekall.

98
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,680
- You're thinking of going there?
- I don't know, maybe.

99
00:11:18,782 --> 00:11:20,579
- Well, don't.
- Why not?

100
00:11:20,884 --> 00:11:25,412
A friend of mine tried one of these in a special office,
nearly got himself lobotomized.

101
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,387
No shit?

102
00:11:27,558 --> 00:11:30,049
Don't fuck with your brain, pal.
It ain't worth it.

103
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:33,860
I guess not.

104
00:12:18,308 --> 00:12:20,674
Good afternoon.
welcome to Rekall.

105
00:12:20,844 --> 00:12:22,835
Douglas Quaid.
I have an appointment.

106
00:12:26,283 --> 00:12:27,750
- Bob?
- Yeah?

107
00:12:27,818 --> 00:12:30,685
- Doug Quaid is here to see you.
- Yeah, I'll be right out.
- Okay.

108
00:12:32,056 --> 00:12:33,717
That'll be just one minute, Mr. Quaid.

109
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:36,424
Thank you.

110
00:12:44,035 --> 00:12:47,437
- Doug! Paul McClane. It's good to see ya.
- Nice to meet you.

111
00:12:47,437 --> 00:12:48,870
Come on in, through here.

112
00:12:50,674 --> 00:12:52,801
- Please have a seat, make yourself comfortable.
- Thank you.

113
00:12:53,944 --> 00:12:55,545
Now, help me out here, Doug.

114
00:12:55,545 --> 00:12:58,173
- You were interested in a memory of a--
- Mars.

115
00:12:59,616 --> 00:13:01,208
Yeah. Mars.

116
00:13:01,385 --> 00:13:02,682
Is that a problem?

117
00:13:04,755 --> 00:13:06,347
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug...

118
00:13:06,556 --> 00:13:07,887
if outer spaces is your thing...

119
00:13:08,091 --> 00:13:12,585
I think you would be much happier with
one of our Saturn cruises. Everybody raves about them.

120
00:13:12,796 --> 00:13:15,492
No, I'm not interested in Saturn.
I said Mars.

121
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:17,966
Okay. You're the boss.

122
00:13:19,303 --> 00:13:21,294
Mars it is.

123
00:13:21,938 --> 00:13:23,530
Now, let me see.

124
00:13:23,707 --> 00:13:25,607
The basic Mars package...

125
00:13:25,676 --> 00:13:29,009
will run you 899 credits.

126
00:13:29,313 --> 00:13:32,612
Now, that's for two full weeks
of memories, complete in every detail.

127
00:13:32,783 --> 00:13:36,241
If you want a longer trip that'll cost a little more
because it's a deeper implant.

128
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,689
What's in the two-week package?

129
00:13:38,689 --> 00:13:42,181
First of all, Doug. Let me tell you, when you go Rekall,
you get nothing but first-class memories.

130
00:13:43,627 --> 00:13:47,461
Private cabin in a shuttle, deluxe suite
at the Hilton Plaza, all the major sights:

131
00:13:47,698 --> 00:13:49,893
Mount Pyramid,
the Grand Canals...

132
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:52,401
and, of course, Venusville.

133
00:13:52,502 --> 00:13:54,163
But how real does it seem?

134
00:13:54,604 --> 00:13:58,734
- As real as any memory in your head.
- Come on, don't bullshit me.

135
00:13:58,842 --> 00:14:01,675
No, I'm telling you, Doug. Your brain
will not know the difference.

136
00:14:01,878 --> 00:14:03,778
That's guaranteed or your money back.

137
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,313
What about the guy you lobotomized?
did he get a refund?

138
00:14:10,787 --> 00:14:12,778
You're talking ancient history.

139
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:16,958
Nowadays traveling with Rekall
is safer than getting on a rocket.

140
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,923
Check out those statistics.

141
00:14:19,096 --> 00:14:22,725
Besides, a real holiday
is a pain in the butt.

142
00:14:22,933 --> 00:14:25,527
You got lost luggage, lousy weather...

143
00:14:25,702 --> 00:14:27,567
crooked taxi drivers.

144
00:14:27,771 --> 00:14:29,864
When you travel with Rekall...

145
00:14:30,006 --> 00:14:32,873
everything is perfect.

146
00:14:33,076 --> 00:14:34,236
So, what do you say?

147
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,176
- All right.
- Smart move.

148
00:14:39,383 --> 00:14:42,580
All right, while you fill out
this questionnaire,

149
00:14:42,719 --> 00:14:45,210
I'll gonna familiarize you
with some of our options.

150
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:46,686
No options.

151
00:14:47,824 --> 00:14:51,225
Whatever you say.
Can I ask you just one question, though?

152
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:54,027
What is it? Is it exactly the same...

153
00:14:54,398 --> 00:14:57,458
about every single vacation
you have ever taken?

154
00:14:58,702 --> 00:14:59,726
I give up.

155
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,532
You. You're the same.

156
00:15:02,739 --> 00:15:05,264
No matter where you go, There you are.
It's always the same old you.

157
00:15:06,109 --> 00:15:08,600
Let me suggest
that you take a vacation...

158
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:10,041
from yourself.

159
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,715
I know, it sounds wild.

160
00:15:11,715 --> 00:15:14,479
It is the latest thing in travel.
we call it the Ego Trip.

161
00:15:15,652 --> 00:15:16,949
No, I'm not interested in that.

162
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,655
You're gonna love this, Doug.

163
00:15:18,655 --> 00:15:22,284
We offer you a choice of
alternate identities during your trip.

164
00:15:22,793 --> 00:15:26,285
I mean, face it. Why go to Mars as a tourist
when you can go as a playboy...

165
00:15:26,496 --> 00:15:28,225
or a famous jock or--

166
00:15:28,432 --> 00:15:29,421
''Secret agent.''

167
00:15:29,599 --> 00:15:31,260
How much is that?

168
00:15:34,471 --> 00:15:41,701
Let me tantalize you. You're a top operative,
back under deep cover on your most important mission.

169
00:15:41,701 --> 00:15:44,103
People are trying to kill you, left and right.

170
00:15:44,448 --> 00:15:47,611
You meet this beautiful,
exotic woman.

171
00:15:47,751 --> 00:15:48,740
Go on.

172
00:15:48,885 --> 00:15:51,479
I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug...

173
00:15:51,655 --> 00:15:53,748
but you wrest the shore, by the time
the trip is over...

174
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:57,758
you get the girl, kill the bad guys
and save the entire planet.

175
00:15:57,994 --> 00:15:59,427
Now, you tell me.

176
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:02,462
Isn't that worth a measly 300 credits?

177
00:16:16,947 --> 00:16:19,383
- It this your first trip?
- Um-Huh

178
00:16:19,483 --> 00:16:22,316
Well, don't worry. Things hardly ever fuck up around here.

179
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,485
Good evening... Doug.

180
00:16:25,689 --> 00:16:27,919
- I'm Dr. Lull.
- Nice to meet you.

181
00:16:28,091 --> 00:16:31,788
Ernie, patch in matrix 62-B-37.

182
00:16:31,995 --> 00:16:34,793
And, would you like us to integrate
some alien stuff?

183
00:16:34,998 --> 00:16:36,795
Sure. Why not?

184
00:16:38,602 --> 00:16:39,899
Two-headed monsters?

185
00:16:40,036 --> 00:16:41,833
Don't you keep up with the news?

186
00:16:42,038 --> 00:16:45,565
- We're doing alien artifacts now.
- It's wild.

187
00:16:45,742 --> 00:16:48,540
Yeah, they date back a million years.

188
00:16:49,913 --> 00:16:51,548
- Ernie?
- That's a new one.

189
00:16:51,548 --> 00:16:53,209
- Blue sky on Mars.
- Been married long?

190
00:16:54,651 --> 00:16:56,949
- Eight years.
- Oh, I see.

191
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,578
Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.

192
00:16:59,756 --> 00:17:02,418
- Not really. I've always been fascinated with Mars.
- All systems go.

193
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:04,456
Number seven.

194
00:17:04,628 --> 00:17:05,925
Ready for dreamland?

195
00:17:08,665 --> 00:17:12,726
I'll be asking you some questions, Doug,
so we can fine-tune the Ego program.

196
00:17:12,836 --> 00:17:15,669
You answer honestly,
you'll enjoy yourself whole a lot more.

197
00:17:15,872 --> 00:17:18,534
- Your sexual orientation.
- Hetero.

198
00:17:23,947 --> 00:17:25,812
How do you like your women?

199
00:17:26,182 --> 00:17:28,980
Blonde? Brunette? Redhead?

200
00:17:29,986 --> 00:17:31,146
Brunette.

201
00:17:33,456 --> 00:17:37,290
Slim. Athletic. Voluptuous.

202
00:17:40,997 --> 00:17:42,396
Athletic.

203
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:50,570
Demure. Aggressive. Sleazy.

204
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,071
Be honest.

205
00:17:52,242 --> 00:17:53,675
Sleazy.

206
00:17:58,081 --> 00:17:59,241
Demure.

207
00:18:02,052 --> 00:18:03,485
- 41A, Ernie.

208
00:18:05,055 --> 00:18:07,250
Oh, boy, is he gonna have a wild time?

209
00:18:08,425 --> 00:18:11,758
- Is he not gonna want to come back?
- Oh, that's for sure.

210
00:18:33,183 --> 00:18:34,172
So...

211
00:18:34,317 --> 00:18:36,114
what do you say?

212
00:18:36,286 --> 00:18:39,119
I'm not so sure,
and I don't get a souvenir.

213
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:44,727
Not true. For just a few more credits, we supply T-shirts,
snapshots of you at the site...

214
00:18:44,894 --> 00:18:46,725
and even letters from the...

215
00:18:50,133 --> 00:18:52,026
- What is it?
- You'd better get down here.

216
00:18:52,069 --> 00:18:54,401
Look, I am with a very important client.

217
00:18:54,571 --> 00:18:56,869
It looks like we got
another schizoid embolism.

218
00:18:58,675 --> 00:19:00,267
I'll be right back.

219
00:19:00,267 --> 00:19:01,433
Uh, Mr. McClane?

220
00:19:03,347 --> 00:19:04,837
Bob! What's wrong?

221
00:19:05,015 --> 00:19:06,812
Don't let her leave!

222
00:19:11,722 --> 00:19:13,417
Get off!

223
00:19:15,459 --> 00:19:16,949
You blew my cover!

224
00:19:17,361 --> 00:19:20,353
You can't do a simple goddamn double implant?

225
00:19:20,497 --> 00:19:21,930
Not my fault. We hit a memory cap.

226
00:19:22,165 --> 00:19:24,368
They'll be here at any minute!
They'll kill you all!

227
00:19:24,368 --> 00:19:27,030
- What is he talking about?
- Let me go!

228
00:19:27,471 --> 00:19:29,234
Mr. Quaid, try to calm down!

229
00:19:31,808 --> 00:19:33,605
My name is not Quaid.

230
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:37,541
- Let me go! Untie me now!
- Ernie, grab his leg!

231
00:19:37,748 --> 00:19:40,216
- Hold him down!
- Let me go!

232
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,238
Are you all right?

233
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,401
Listen to me.
he's been going on and on about Mars.

234
00:20:09,545 --> 00:20:12,378
- He has really been there.
- Use your head, you dumb bitch.

235
00:20:12,548 --> 00:20:15,745
He's just acting out the 'secret agent'
portion of his ego trip.

236
00:20:15,852 --> 00:20:17,649
- I'm afraid that's not possible.
- Why not?

237
00:20:17,887 --> 00:20:19,582
Because we haven't implanted it yet.

238
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,222
Oh, shit.

239
00:20:26,829 --> 00:20:30,390
I've been trying to tell you,
someone has erased his memory.

240
00:20:30,566 --> 00:20:31,726
Excuse me.

241
00:20:31,834 --> 00:20:33,503
'Someone'?

242
00:20:33,503 --> 00:20:35,300
We're talking about the fucking Agency.

243
00:20:35,505 --> 00:20:38,133
- Shut up!
- Bob, the client's gone.

244
00:20:40,877 --> 00:20:44,438
Ok, all right. Look, here's what we're gonna do.
Renata, cover up any memory he's got of us or Rekall.

245
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,707
I'll do what I can.
It's pretty messy in there.

246
00:20:46,849 --> 00:20:49,977
Ernie, dump him in a cab, around the corner.
Tiffany, you help him.

247
00:20:50,153 --> 00:20:52,951
I'm gonna destroy his file
and refund his money.

248
00:20:53,156 --> 00:20:56,557
And if anybody comes asking,
we never even heard of Douglas Quaid.

249
00:21:11,007 --> 00:21:12,440
Where am I?

250
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,646
You're in a Johnnycab.

251
00:21:16,646 --> 00:21:18,170
I mean what am I doing here?

252
00:21:18,281 --> 00:21:21,546
I'm sorry. Would you please
rephrase the question?

253
00:21:21,951 --> 00:21:23,819
How did I get in this taxi?

254
00:21:23,819 --> 00:21:26,310
The door opened, you got in.

255
00:21:29,525 --> 00:21:31,356
Hell of a day, isn't it?

256
00:21:45,074 --> 00:21:46,905
- This okay?
- Right here.

257
00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:49,603
- Thank you for taking Johnnycab.
- Thank you.

258
00:21:49,912 --> 00:21:52,380
Hope you enjoyed the ride.

259
00:21:52,548 --> 00:21:53,845
Hey, Quaid.

260
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:57,380
- Harry.
- How was your trip to Mars?

261
00:21:57,553 --> 00:22:00,579
- What trip?
- You went to Rekall. Remember?

262
00:22:01,724 --> 00:22:03,783
- I did?
- Yeah, you did.

263
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,418
- I told you not to, but you went in anyway.
- What are you, my father?

264
00:22:08,965 --> 00:22:12,128
- Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
- Listen. I'm already late, thank you very much. But...

265
00:22:13,903 --> 00:22:16,701
Okay, bring him--
come on, move it!

266
00:22:16,973 --> 00:22:19,168
Let's go get that drink.
move it!

267
00:22:19,408 --> 00:22:22,673
What is going on?
what the fuck did I do wrong?

268
00:22:22,979 --> 00:22:25,971
- Tell me!
- You blabbed, Quaid, you blabbed about Mars!

269
00:22:26,115 --> 00:22:29,318
Are you crazy? I don't even know
anything about Mars!

270
00:22:29,318 --> 00:22:32,617
You should've listened to me, Quaid.
I was there to keep you out of trouble.

271
00:22:36,058 --> 00:22:39,755
Hey, you're making a big mistake.
you got me mixed up with somebody else.

272
00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:42,263
Uh-uh, pal. You got yourself mixed up with somebody--

273
00:23:32,882 --> 00:23:35,476
And pivot... and serve...

274
00:23:35,685 --> 00:23:37,983
and shift... and stroke...

275
00:23:43,626 --> 00:23:45,491
Very good.
perfect form.

276
00:23:49,131 --> 00:23:50,530
Hi, honey.

277
00:23:52,568 --> 00:23:55,799
- What are you doing?
- Some men just tried to kill me.

278
00:23:55,938 --> 00:23:57,496
Muggers? Are you all right?

279
00:23:57,673 --> 00:23:59,573
No, they were spies or something.

280
00:23:59,742 --> 00:24:02,404
And Harry, from work, he was the--
get down!

281
00:24:02,611 --> 00:24:06,315
- Harry was the boss.
- Take it easy, Doug, okay?

282
00:24:06,315 --> 00:24:10,149
- Tell me exactly what happened. Why would spies wanna kill you?
- I don't know.

283
00:24:10,353 --> 00:24:13,618
- But it had something to do with Mars.
- Mars? You haven't even been to Mars.

284
00:24:13,756 --> 00:24:16,987
I know, it sounds crazy, but I went to
this Rekall place after work--

285
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,255
- You went to those brain butchers?
- Let me finish.

286
00:24:19,662 --> 00:24:23,758
- What did they do to you, tell me?
- I got a trip to Mars. And.. so what happened was

287
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,336
Forget about Rekall, will you?
These guys were going to kill me.

288
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:30,337
- Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
- They did.

289
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,440
But I killed them.

290
00:24:34,477 --> 00:24:38,914
Listen to me, sweetheart. Those assholes
at Rekall have fucked up your mind.

291
00:24:39,248 --> 00:24:41,409
You're having paranoid delusions.

292
00:24:41,551 --> 00:24:43,849
You call this a delusion?

293
00:24:52,695 --> 00:24:56,597
- Doug, I'm gonna call a doctor.
- Don't. Don't call anybody.

294
00:25:24,994 --> 00:25:27,394
Lori, go! Get out!

295
00:26:18,814 --> 00:26:20,247
Why are you doing this, Lori?

296
00:26:37,066 --> 00:26:38,363
Talk!

297
00:26:38,534 --> 00:26:40,525
- I'm not your wife.
- The hell you're not.

298
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,535
I swear to God I never saw you
before six weeks ago.

299
00:26:42,572 --> 00:26:45,063
Our marriage is just a memory implant.

300
00:26:45,441 --> 00:26:48,035
You think I'm stupid?
I remember our wedding.

301
00:26:48,377 --> 00:26:49,545
It was an implant by the Agency.

302
00:26:49,545 --> 00:26:51,069
- Falling in love.
- Implanted.

303
00:26:51,347 --> 00:26:55,078
Our friends, my job, 8 years together.
Suppose all of these was implanted, too?

304
00:26:55,484 --> 00:26:58,282
The job's real.
The Agency set it up.

305
00:26:58,487 --> 00:26:59,749
Bullshit.

306
00:27:02,158 --> 00:27:04,991
They erased your identity
and implanted a new one.

307
00:27:05,228 --> 00:27:09,494
I was written in as your wife
so that I could watch you and make sure the erasure took.

308
00:27:15,438 --> 00:27:16,427
Sorry, Quaid.

309
00:27:16,572 --> 00:27:18,597
Your whole life is just a dream.

310
00:27:21,444 --> 00:27:25,608
Okay, then if I'm not me,
who the hell am I?

311
00:27:25,748 --> 00:27:26,772
Beats me.

312
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,947
I just work here.

313
00:27:38,561 --> 00:27:40,825
Doug, there's something I want you to know.

314
00:27:42,698 --> 00:27:46,600
You were the best assignment I ever had. Really.

315
00:27:46,802 --> 00:27:48,371
I'm honored.

316
00:27:48,371 --> 00:27:52,137
You sure you don't want to,
just for old times' sake?

317
00:27:53,676 --> 00:27:56,702
Come on, if you don't trust me,
you can tie me up.

318
00:27:58,681 --> 00:28:02,515
- I didn't know you were so kinky.
- Maybe it's time you found out.

319
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,016
Clever girl.

320
00:28:11,761 --> 00:28:15,561
You wouldn't shoot me, will you? Doug.
after all we've been through.

321
00:28:16,766 --> 00:28:18,495
Some of it was fun.

322
00:28:21,604 --> 00:28:23,003
Nice knowing you.

323
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,998
Don't touch her.

324
00:29:00,142 --> 00:29:01,131
Nobody here.

325
00:29:02,912 --> 00:29:06,349
- Are you okay?
- I guess I blew it.

326
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:08,715
- What does he remember?
- Nothing, so far.

327
00:29:09,151 --> 00:29:10,709
I've got him.

328
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:26,665
Shit! He's going for the subway.
Let's get him. Go.

329
00:29:42,018 --> 00:29:44,816
Pack your stuff and get outta here.

330
00:29:45,021 --> 00:29:46,818
What if they bring him back?

331
00:29:48,024 --> 00:29:49,457
Not a chance.

332
00:29:58,601 --> 00:29:59,898
Subway! Go!

333
00:30:10,713 --> 00:30:12,943
Get him!
he's got a gun!

334
00:30:13,816 --> 00:30:16,808
- Cut him off! That way!
- Over there!

335
00:30:16,953 --> 00:30:18,079
Hold it!

336
00:30:50,253 --> 00:30:51,447
The escalator.

337
00:30:51,554 --> 00:30:53,852
You four go up.
you come with me.

338
00:31:08,871 --> 00:31:10,463
Get out of the way!

339
00:31:13,209 --> 00:31:14,676
Get out of the way! Move!

340
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:46,701
The platform!

341
00:31:50,613 --> 00:31:52,444
- Which way?
- To the right.

342
00:32:19,642 --> 00:32:23,100
Botco.
tomorrow's fuels, tomorrow's prices.

343
00:32:23,746 --> 00:32:26,613
Don't settle for pale memories.
Don't go for fake implants.

344
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:29,485
Experience space travel the old-fashioned way...

345
00:32:29,485 --> 00:32:32,648
on a real, live holiday you can afford.

346
00:32:39,028 --> 00:32:40,796
I want that fucker dead.

347
00:32:40,796 --> 00:32:43,890
I don't blame you, man. I wouldn't want a guy like Quaid porking my old lady.

348
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:48,901
- You're saying she likes it?
- No, I'm sure she hated every minute of it.

349
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:54,203
Six-beta-nine, we have a live
transmission from Mr. Cohaagen.

350
00:32:55,378 --> 00:32:57,972
- Richter here. Patch it through.
- You're a go, Mr. Cohaagen.

351
00:32:58,147 --> 00:33:01,650
- What is the fuck is going on down there?
- I'm trying to neutralize a traitor, sir.

352
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:04,084
If I wanted him dead, you moron.
I would have done it on earth.

353
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,747
We can't let him run around. He knows too much.

354
00:33:08,224 --> 00:33:10,124
Lori says he can't remember jackshit.

355
00:33:10,393 --> 00:33:12,861
That's an hour, an hour
he could have total recall.

356
00:33:13,062 --> 00:33:17,658
Listen to me, Richter. I want Quaid
delivered alive for reimplantation.

357
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,097
Have you got that?

358
00:33:19,235 --> 00:33:22,227
I want him back in place with Lori.

359
00:33:23,606 --> 00:33:24,868
Did you hear me?

360
00:33:26,008 --> 00:33:28,533
What was that, sir?
I couldn't hear you.

361
00:33:28,711 --> 00:33:30,702
What are you doing?
I got Quaid again.

362
00:33:30,813 --> 00:33:33,941
Switching to another channel, sir.
I've got sunspots.

363
00:33:35,851 --> 00:33:37,910
- Call him back!
- I'm losing you.

364
00:33:38,187 --> 00:33:40,956
- Where is he?
- Second level, galleria.

365
00:33:40,956 --> 00:33:43,288
We should've killed Quaid on Mars.

366
00:34:08,751 --> 00:34:10,116
- How are we doing?
- Fine.

367
00:34:13,189 --> 00:34:14,884
Zooming in.

368
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,079
We got him!

369
00:34:36,712 --> 00:34:39,010
If you want to live, don't hang up.

370
00:34:39,181 --> 00:34:40,978
- What do you want?
- I've got your bug.

371
00:34:41,183 --> 00:34:45,381
They'll be bust in your door in three minutes
unless you do exactly as l say.

372
00:34:45,521 --> 00:34:48,319
Don't bother searching.
the bug's in your skull.

373
00:34:51,493 --> 00:34:53,324
- Who are you?
- Never mind.

374
00:34:53,495 --> 00:34:56,365
Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.
that'll muffle the signal.

375
00:34:56,365 --> 00:34:59,129
- How'd you find me?
- I'd advise you to hurry.

376
00:35:02,171 --> 00:35:05,436
This'll buy you some time.
they won't be able to pinpoint you.

377
00:35:14,349 --> 00:35:15,816
- Shit!
- What?

378
00:35:15,984 --> 00:35:18,475
- I lost him.
- Well, find him!

379
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,087
Yeah, right.

380
00:35:20,255 --> 00:35:22,086
Come on, hurry up.
You look beautiful.

381
00:35:25,027 --> 00:35:28,121
Now go to the window.
go.

382
00:35:31,133 --> 00:35:33,226
- Can you see me down here?
- Um-hum.

383
00:35:33,368 --> 00:35:36,496
- This is the suitcase you gave me.
- I gave you?

384
00:35:36,872 --> 00:35:40,308
I'm gonna set it here.
You come and get it, keep moving.

385
00:35:40,475 --> 00:35:42,375
- Wait. Wait.
- What?

386
00:35:42,578 --> 00:35:46,105
- Who are you?
- We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars.

387
00:35:46,248 --> 00:35:49,581
You asked me, if you disappeared,
to come and find you, so here I am. Good-bye.

388
00:35:49,751 --> 00:35:51,185
What was I doing on Mars?

389
00:35:56,658 --> 00:35:58,523
Excuse me, Mam, but this is mine.

390
00:35:58,727 --> 00:36:01,787
- I don't see your name on it.
- Someone left it for me.

391
00:36:01,964 --> 00:36:04,694
- Find your own bag.
- Excuse me, Mam, but I need it!

392
00:36:06,001 --> 00:36:07,696
Fuck you, you asshole!

393
00:36:17,246 --> 00:36:19,941
Son of a bitch's gotta be around here
somewhere.

394
00:36:23,218 --> 00:36:24,242
That guy there.

395
00:36:34,096 --> 00:36:37,963
Hello, I'm Johnnycab.
where can l take you tonight?

396
00:36:39,234 --> 00:36:41,403
Drive. Drive!

397
00:36:41,403 --> 00:36:44,497
- Would you please repeat the destination?
- Anywhere! Just go! Go!

398
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,637
Please state the street and number.

399
00:36:46,842 --> 00:36:48,867
Shit. Shit!

400
00:36:49,011 --> 00:36:52,640
I'm not familiar with that address.
would you please repeat--

401
00:37:00,389 --> 00:37:01,822
Fasten your seat belt!

402
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,626
The fare is 18 credits, please.

403
00:37:37,626 --> 00:37:38,923
Sue me, dickhead.

404
00:37:49,037 --> 00:37:51,505
We hope you enjoyed the ride.

405
00:39:26,668 --> 00:39:28,932
Howdy, stranger.
this is Hauser.

406
00:39:29,871 --> 00:39:32,407
If things have gone wrong,
I'm talking to myself...

407
00:39:32,407 --> 00:39:35,433
and you've got a wet towel
wrapped around your head.

408
00:39:35,744 --> 00:39:39,043
Whatever your name is,
get ready for the big surprise.

409
00:39:40,482 --> 00:39:43,679
You are not you.
you are me.

410
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:46,314
No shit.

411
00:39:48,223 --> 00:39:50,623
Six-beta-nine,
six-beta-nine, come in.

412
00:39:50,992 --> 00:39:52,391
Did you find him?

413
00:39:52,561 --> 00:39:55,394
We picked up an explosion
at the old cement factory.

414
00:39:56,131 --> 00:39:58,656
- Send two units. We'll meet you there.
- Roger

415
00:40:03,572 --> 00:40:06,370
All my life I've worked for Mars Intelligence.

416
00:40:06,575 --> 00:40:08,477
I did Cohaagen's dirty work.

417
00:40:08,477 --> 00:40:11,275
But a few weeks ago I met somebody, a woman.

418
00:40:11,513 --> 00:40:13,276
And I learned a few things.

419
00:40:13,715 --> 00:40:16,411
Like, I've been playing for the wrong team.

420
00:40:17,686 --> 00:40:21,423
All I can do now is try to make up for it.

421
00:40:21,423 --> 00:40:24,586
See, there's enough shit in here
to fuck Cohaagen good.

422
00:40:25,026 --> 00:40:29,122
Unfortunately, if you're listening to this,
that means he has got to me first.

423
00:40:30,132 --> 00:40:31,861
And here comes the hard part, old buddy.

424
00:40:32,067 --> 00:40:34,160
Now it is all up to you.

425
00:40:34,469 --> 00:40:35,595
Great.

426
00:40:47,282 --> 00:40:49,147
- What have we got?
- Nothing here.

427
00:40:49,518 --> 00:40:51,816
- He's gone.
- I got a weak signal over there.

428
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,387
Split up. Find him.

429
00:40:53,555 --> 00:40:56,353
First let's get rid of that bug in your head.

430
00:40:56,591 --> 00:41:00,061
Take this thing out of the case
and stick it up your nose.

431
00:41:00,061 --> 00:41:01,892
Don't worry. It's self-guiding.

432
00:41:08,336 --> 00:41:10,497
Just shove real hard.

433
00:41:16,344 --> 00:41:18,039
When you hear a crunches, you're there.

434
00:41:19,748 --> 00:41:21,409
Just pull it out.

435
00:41:21,449 --> 00:41:23,679
Be careful. It's my head too.

436
00:41:45,874 --> 00:41:47,671
I've got a lock.

437
00:41:47,876 --> 00:41:49,173
Up. Let's go.

438
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,047
Now, this is the plan.

439
00:41:53,215 --> 00:41:54,649
Get your ass to Mars...

440
00:41:54,649 --> 00:41:57,914
then go to the Hilton and flash
the Brubaker I.D. at the desk.

441
00:41:58,353 --> 00:42:00,014
That's all does to it.

442
00:42:00,014 --> 00:42:07,892
Just do what I tell you. If we can nail this son of a bitch who fucked you and me.
I'm counting on you, Buddy.

443
00:42:08,296 --> 00:42:09,923
Don't let me down.

444
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,049
Straight ahead.

445
00:42:44,132 --> 00:42:45,531
In there.

446
00:42:54,042 --> 00:42:55,509
There!

447
00:43:13,828 --> 00:43:14,658
Give me that.

448
00:43:20,235 --> 00:43:21,224
Shit.

449
00:43:22,837 --> 00:43:25,931
Get your ass to Mars--
get your ass to Mars--

450
00:43:59,507 --> 00:44:01,304
Welcome to the Mars Federal Colony.

451
00:44:02,177 --> 00:44:04,941
For your safety and comfort,
domes have been installed...

452
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,305
to protect you from the vacuum outside.

453
00:44:07,449 --> 00:44:10,976
Please do not touch
exterior windows or air locks.

454
00:44:11,219 --> 00:44:16,023
And since the air volume is limited. No smoking is allowed anywhere in the colony.

455
00:44:16,023 --> 00:44:16,912
Next.

456
00:44:18,392 --> 00:44:21,190
Thank you,
and enjoy your stay on Mars.

457
00:44:21,429 --> 00:44:22,726
Passport.

458
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:38,107
- Get out of the way.
- Make way!

459
00:44:38,445 --> 00:44:40,174
Stand back.

460
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:48,947
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.

461
00:44:50,124 --> 00:44:51,716
Any news of Quaid?

462
00:44:51,892 --> 00:44:55,896
- Not since you lost him.
- Watch your mouth, Captain.
- We've got a car to take you from the port.

463
00:44:55,896 --> 00:44:59,297
- How long do you plan to stay?
- Two weeks.

464
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,393
Look at that shit.

465
00:45:01,536 --> 00:45:04,903
- What the hell's this?
- The Martians love Kuato.

466
00:45:05,072 --> 00:45:07,336
They think he's fuckin' George Washington.

467
00:45:07,475 --> 00:45:08,965
Kill the bastard.

468
00:45:09,143 --> 00:45:10,667
Nobody knows who he is.

469
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:15,575
Have you brought any fruits
or vegetables onto the planet?

470
00:45:15,616 --> 00:45:16,844
Two weeks.

471
00:45:17,819 --> 00:45:18,808
Excuse me?

472
00:45:20,321 --> 00:45:22,152
Two weeks.

473
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:31,423
It's not just graffiti.

474
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,897
The rebels took over
the refinery last night.

475
00:45:34,035 --> 00:45:35,627
No terbinium is going out.

476
00:45:35,837 --> 00:45:37,668
And it gets worse.

477
00:45:58,426 --> 00:45:59,620
Quaid.

478
00:46:00,628 --> 00:46:02,061
- That's Quaid!
- Where?

479
00:46:02,196 --> 00:46:03,925
The woman!
get him-- her!

480
00:46:05,132 --> 00:46:06,724
Arrest that woman!

481
00:46:06,934 --> 00:46:08,401
Get that woman! Grab her!

482
00:46:38,032 --> 00:46:39,329
Catch!

483
00:46:41,469 --> 00:46:43,596
Get ready for a surprise!

484
00:47:54,608 --> 00:47:56,439
- Open the goddamn door!
- I can't!

485
00:47:56,644 --> 00:47:57,872
Open it!

486
00:47:57,979 --> 00:47:59,640
They're all connected!

487
00:48:09,057 --> 00:48:12,624
- That's terrible.
- And a few days ago Cohaagen raised the price of air.

488
00:48:12,793 --> 00:48:16,024
- Again?
- Nobody on Earth gives a damn what happens up here.

489
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:18,963
And they just want terbinium
so they can fight the stupid war.

490
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,931
Excuse me. What's that?

491
00:48:21,102 --> 00:48:23,270
You mean the Pyramid Mine?

492
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:26,637
I used to work there until
they found that alien shit inside.

493
00:48:27,008 --> 00:48:29,442
Well, that's a rumor, isn't it?

494
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:30,907
Think so?

495
00:49:00,709 --> 00:49:02,806
Mr. Cohaagen.

496
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:11,247
You wanted to see me, sir?

497
00:49:15,056 --> 00:49:16,518
Richter...

498
00:49:17,725 --> 00:49:19,750
do you know why I'm such a happy person?

499
00:49:20,194 --> 00:49:21,491
No, sir.

500
00:49:23,297 --> 00:49:26,664
Because I've got the greatest job
in the solar system.

501
00:49:26,668 --> 00:49:30,661
As long as the terbinium keeps flowing,
I can do anything I want.

502
00:49:30,805 --> 00:49:32,102
Anything.

503
00:49:33,708 --> 00:49:35,300
In fact.,

504
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:38,673
The only thing I ever worried about
is that one day...

505
00:49:38,813 --> 00:49:40,940
if the rebels win...

506
00:49:41,082 --> 00:49:43,607
it all might end...

507
00:49:43,785 --> 00:49:45,343
and you're fucking making it happen!

508
00:49:46,054 --> 00:49:48,887
First you trying kill Quaid,
then you let him get away.

509
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:51,317
He had help from our side, sir.

510
00:49:52,894 --> 00:49:53,952
I know that.

511
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:58,262
- But I thought--
- Who told you to think?

512
00:49:58,633 --> 00:50:01,625
I don't give you
enough information to think.

513
00:50:03,171 --> 00:50:06,766
You do what you're told.
that's what you do.

514
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:10,204
Yes, sir.

515
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:17,115
Now, let's get down to business.

516
00:50:18,853 --> 00:50:21,083
We've got a tricky situation here.

517
00:50:21,522 --> 00:50:23,752
Kuato wants what's in Quaid's head.

518
00:50:25,159 --> 00:50:28,492
And he might be able to get it.
cause they say he's psychic.

519
00:50:29,931 --> 00:50:32,729
And I have a plan
to keep this from happening.

520
00:50:36,237 --> 00:50:38,068
Do you think you could play along?

521
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:40,469
- Yes, sir.
- Great.

522
00:50:40,575 --> 00:50:42,873
Cause otherwise, I'll erase your ass.

523
00:51:00,995 --> 00:51:04,863
Taxi? You need a taxi?
Sir, I got magazines, music, whisky.

524
00:51:05,299 --> 00:51:07,699
You need a cab, Man?
Come on!

525
00:51:33,361 --> 00:51:34,760
Afternoon! Can I help you?

526
00:51:34,929 --> 00:51:37,295
Yes, I would like a room, please.

527
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:45,503
Nice to have you back, Mr. Brubaker.
would you like the same suite?

528
00:51:45,673 --> 00:51:46,935
Definitely.

529
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:51,235
Seemed you've left something in our safe.

530
00:51:51,345 --> 00:51:52,175
Could you get it?

531
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:00,118
Identification?

532
00:52:09,497 --> 00:52:11,795
- I'll go and code your room key.
- Thank you.

533
00:52:27,816 --> 00:52:31,315
- There you go, Mr Brubaker. Suite 610 in the east wing.
- Thank you.

534
00:52:31,486 --> 00:52:33,784
- Could I borrow your pen, please?
- Certainly.

535
00:52:45,967 --> 00:52:47,264
Thank you.

536
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:54,838
Hey, man, you need a cab?

537
00:52:55,009 --> 00:52:59,469
- What's wrong with this one?
- He ain't got five kids to feed.

538
00:52:59,647 --> 00:53:01,945
- Where's yours?
- Right over there, Man.

539
00:53:04,486 --> 00:53:06,977
Hey, asshole!
that's my fare!

540
00:53:07,322 --> 00:53:08,550
Eat this!

541
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:09,884
Damn you, Benny!

542
00:53:16,331 --> 00:53:17,730
Welcome to Mars, man!

543
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:25,497
- What the hell was that, an accident?
- That's the rebels, man.

544
00:53:25,673 --> 00:53:26,970
Let's get outta here...

545
00:53:27,308 --> 00:53:28,900
before they arrest us!

546
00:53:29,277 --> 00:53:31,379
What do the rebels want?

547
00:53:31,379 --> 00:53:34,246
All the usual.
more money, more freedom, more air.

548
00:53:39,587 --> 00:53:40,781
So, where to?

549
00:53:40,889 --> 00:53:42,584
Last Resort.

550
00:53:42,757 --> 00:53:44,657
You're getting off to an early start.

551
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,853
- First time on Mars?
- Yes.

552
00:53:48,029 --> 00:53:49,792
Well, actually, no.

553
00:53:49,998 --> 00:53:51,659
Well, sort of.

554
00:53:51,833 --> 00:53:55,701
Damn, the man don't even know
whether he's been to Mars or not.

555
00:54:06,347 --> 00:54:08,645
Voila. Venusville.

556
00:54:09,817 --> 00:54:12,115
Hey, you see anything you like?

557
00:54:16,424 --> 00:54:19,518
Well, this is the end of the line.
we'd better walk from here.

558
00:54:19,694 --> 00:54:21,491
I'll show you the way.

559
00:54:21,696 --> 00:54:25,325
- Do you wanna know the future?
- What about the past?

560
00:54:25,567 --> 00:54:29,196
Come on, it's around the corner,
right down this alley.

561
00:54:29,404 --> 00:54:31,235
They got everything.

562
00:54:33,841 --> 00:54:35,638
Not bad, huh?

563
00:54:37,345 --> 00:54:41,849
Read your palm? Your mind? Your aura?
probe the secrets of your heart?

564
00:54:41,849 --> 00:54:43,874
- I bet I can guess your birthday.
- What is it?

565
00:54:44,018 --> 00:54:46,816
- You're a Taurus, right?
- How did you guess?

566
00:54:49,691 --> 00:54:51,886
- Tell me something, are all the psychics--
- Freaks?

567
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:53,960
Afraid so.
It goes with the territory.

568
00:54:54,195 --> 00:54:59,101
- What happened to them?
- Cheap domes, and no air to clean up the rays.

569
00:54:59,101 --> 00:55:03,401
So, this is it. The Last Resort.
you sure you want to go in here?

570
00:55:03,605 --> 00:55:06,665
- Why not?
- I know this much better place down the street.

571
00:55:06,808 --> 00:55:09,641
The girls are cleaner,
the liquor ain't watered down--

572
00:55:09,811 --> 00:55:11,972
Sure, and you get kickbacks.

573
00:55:12,113 --> 00:55:14,882
Hey, man,
I got five kids to feed.

574
00:55:14,882 --> 00:55:16,645
Take them to the dentist.

575
00:55:17,085 --> 00:55:19,420
Thanks, mister!
Hey, mister, I'll be waiting for you.

576
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:22,650
Take your time.
Benny's the name. Benny!

577
00:55:41,943 --> 00:55:43,934
- What do you want?
- I'm looking for Melina.

578
00:55:44,078 --> 00:55:45,739
She's busy.

579
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:47,771
But Mary here, she's free.

580
00:55:47,815 --> 00:55:51,251
Well, not free, honey, but...

581
00:55:52,186 --> 00:55:53,483
available. Hahaha.

582
00:55:56,691 --> 00:55:58,921
Thanks.
I'll wait for Melina.

583
00:55:59,093 --> 00:56:00,151
Earth slime.

584
00:56:00,495 --> 00:56:02,964
Thing is, friend, mel's real picky.

585
00:56:02,964 --> 00:56:04,989
She kinds sticks to her regulars.

586
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,331
She'll like me.

587
00:56:08,569 --> 00:56:09,831
Mel! Hey, Mel!

588
00:56:47,642 --> 00:56:48,802
Hello, Hauser.

589
00:56:49,944 --> 00:56:51,775
Still bulging, I see.

590
00:56:53,281 --> 00:56:56,580
- What have you been feeding this thing?
- Blondes.

591
00:56:57,919 --> 00:56:59,716
I think it's still hungry.

592
00:57:02,156 --> 00:57:05,823
You got a lot of nerve
showing your face around here, Hauser.

593
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:07,325
Look who's talking.

594
00:57:07,562 --> 00:57:10,264
Hey, Tony,
give the big guy a break.

595
00:57:10,264 --> 00:57:12,459
Relax. You'll live longer.

596
00:57:12,967 --> 00:57:14,264
Come on.

597
00:57:20,412 --> 00:57:24,348
- Honey, take care of Tony, will you?
- No problem.

598
00:57:24,348 --> 00:57:27,112
If you need any help with this one,
give me a holler.

599
00:57:42,433 --> 00:57:44,133
You son of a bitch.

600
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:47,129
You're alive? I thought that
Cohaagen tortured you to death.

601
00:57:47,271 --> 00:57:49,034
Well, I guess he didn't.

602
00:57:49,107 --> 00:57:52,804
And you couldn't get me a message? You
never even wondered what happened to me?

603
00:58:00,384 --> 00:58:02,682
Hauser! Hauser, thank God you're alive.

604
00:58:03,622 --> 00:58:07,817
Melin-- Melina.
Melina.

605
00:58:07,892 --> 00:58:10,656
- I have to tell you something.
- What?

606
00:58:10,895 --> 00:58:14,456
- I don't remember you.
- What are you talking about?

607
00:58:14,633 --> 00:58:16,658
I don't remember you.

608
00:58:16,835 --> 00:58:20,066
I don't remember us.
I don't even remember me.

609
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:24,374
Oh, what? Did you get amnesia?
how did you get here?

610
00:58:24,609 --> 00:58:26,839
- Hauser left me a note.
- You're Hauser.

611
00:58:27,178 --> 00:58:29,009
Not anymore.

612
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:32,411
Now I'm Quaid.
Douglas Quaid.

613
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:39,491
- Hauser, you've lost your mind.
- I didn't lose my mind. Cohaagen stole it.

614
00:58:39,491 --> 00:58:43,860
He found out that Hauser switched sides,
so he turned him into somebody else: me.

615
00:58:44,296 --> 00:58:45,695
This is too weird.

616
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:48,457
He dumped me on earth
with a wife and a lousy job--

617
00:58:48,633 --> 00:58:51,466
Did you say... Did you say wife?
are you fucking married?

618
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:53,501
- She wasn't really my wife.
- Oh, she isn't really your wife?

619
00:58:53,705 --> 00:58:56,107
How stupid of me.
she was Hauser's wife?

620
00:58:56,107 --> 00:58:58,701
- Look, forget that I said wife.
- No, let's just forget everything.

621
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:02,807
- I'm sick of hearing your goddamn lies.
- Why would I lie to you?

622
00:59:03,948 --> 00:59:07,213
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.

623
00:59:07,519 --> 00:59:09,919
Don't be ridiculous.

624
00:59:12,691 --> 00:59:14,818
You never loved me, Hauser.

625
00:59:14,959 --> 00:59:16,790
You just used me to get inside.

626
00:59:16,995 --> 00:59:18,758
Inside what?

627
00:59:23,001 --> 00:59:24,901
I think you'd better leave.

628
00:59:24,969 --> 00:59:28,234
- Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
- I'm not falling for it.

629
00:59:28,573 --> 00:59:30,575
He says there's enough in here
to nail Cohaagen for good.

630
00:59:30,575 --> 00:59:32,372
- Get out!
- You've got to help me remember!

631
00:59:32,644 --> 00:59:34,669
- I said, get out!
- Melina, please!

632
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:36,777
People are trying to kill me.

633
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:39,409
Really?

634
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:43,811
All right, I'm leaving.

635
00:59:55,934 --> 00:59:58,767
Baby, you make me wish
I had three hands.

636
00:59:58,937 --> 01:00:01,599
Well, I think you're doing
just fine with two.

637
01:00:01,773 --> 01:00:04,037
Excuse me, baby.
we'll pick this up later.

638
01:00:04,175 --> 01:00:06,609
Hey, that didn't take long.

639
01:00:06,778 --> 01:00:09,144
Listen, let me ask you a question.
did you ever fuck a mutant?

640
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:11,782
- Take me to the hotel.
- I know these Siamese twins.

641
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:14,510
Man, you won't know
if you're coming or going.

642
01:00:24,129 --> 01:00:27,758
This afternoon at 4:30 p.m., I signed
an order declaring martial law...

643
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:30,194
throughout the Mars Federal Colony.

644
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:34,871
I will not tolerate any further damage
to our mineral export operations.

645
01:00:35,073 --> 01:00:37,166
Mr. Kuato and his terrorists
must understand...

646
01:00:37,475 --> 01:00:40,774
that their self-defeating efforts
will only bring misery and suffering to the people...

647
01:00:44,316 --> 01:00:46,142
Mr. Quaid?

648
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:47,644
What?

649
01:00:47,786 --> 01:00:49,981
I need to talk to you about Mr. Hauser.

650
01:00:51,256 --> 01:00:53,588
- Who are you?
- Dr. Edgemar from Rekall.

651
01:00:53,658 --> 01:00:55,819
- How did you find me?
- It's a little difficult to explain.

652
01:00:56,094 --> 01:00:58,824
Could you open the door?
I'm unarmed.

653
01:01:00,732 --> 01:01:03,530
Don't worry. I'm alone.
may I come in?

654
01:01:05,804 --> 01:01:08,840
- What do you want?
- This is gonna be very difficult for you to accept, Mr Quaid.

655
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:12,298
- I'm listening.
- I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.

656
01:01:14,279 --> 01:01:17,544
- Hum. You know. Doc, you could fool me.
- I'm quite serious.

657
01:01:17,682 --> 01:01:20,810
You're not here and neither am I.

658
01:01:20,952 --> 01:01:22,112
That's amazing.

659
01:01:22,253 --> 01:01:25,416
- Where are we?
- At Rekall.

660
01:01:25,557 --> 01:01:27,354
You're strapped into an implant chair...

661
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:30,153
and I'm monitoring you
from the psychoprobe console.

662
01:01:31,563 --> 01:01:33,832
Ah, I get it. I'm dreaming.

663
01:01:33,832 --> 01:01:37,199
And all this is a part of the delightful
vacation your company has sold me.

664
01:01:37,635 --> 01:01:38,932
Not exactly.

665
01:01:39,037 --> 01:01:43,098
What you're experiencing is a free-form
delusion based on our memory tapes...

666
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:45,801
but you're inventing it
yourself as you go along.

667
01:01:47,111 --> 01:01:50,547
Well, if it is my delusion,
who the hell invited you?

668
01:01:50,648 --> 01:01:54,414
I've been artificially implanted
as an emergency measure.

669
01:01:54,652 --> 01:01:57,849
I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr Quaid,
but you've suffered a schizoid embolism.

670
01:01:57,922 --> 01:02:00,288
We can't snap you
out of your fantasy...

671
01:02:00,725 --> 01:02:03,717
and I've been sent in to try to talk you down.

672
01:02:03,862 --> 01:02:05,659
How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?

673
01:02:06,998 --> 01:02:10,991
Think about it. Your dream started
in the middle of the implant procedure.

674
01:02:11,236 --> 01:02:13,636
Everything after that--
the chases, the trip to Mars...

675
01:02:13,972 --> 01:02:18,306
the suite at the Hilton are all elements
of your Rekall Holiday and Ego Trip.

676
01:02:18,643 --> 01:02:20,838
You paid to be a secret agent.

677
01:02:20,979 --> 01:02:23,447
Bullshit. It's coincidence.

678
01:02:23,615 --> 01:02:25,981
And what about the girl?

679
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:28,846
Brunette, athletic,
sleazy and demure?

680
01:02:29,053 --> 01:02:31,544
Just as you specified.
Is that coincidence?

681
01:02:31,723 --> 01:02:35,159
Uh. She's real. l dreamt about her
before I even went to Rekall.

682
01:02:35,326 --> 01:02:37,487
Mr. Quaid.

683
01:02:37,629 --> 01:02:41,531
Can you hear yourself?
she's real because you dreamed her?

684
01:02:41,733 --> 01:02:44,600
- That's right.
- Oh, maybe this'll convince you.

685
01:02:44,836 --> 01:02:47,134
Would you mind opening the door?

686
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:51,340
- You open it.
- No need to be rude.

687
01:02:51,743 --> 01:02:53,472
I'll do it.

688
01:03:00,084 --> 01:03:01,244
Sweetheart?

689
01:03:03,955 --> 01:03:05,946
Come in, Mrs. Quaid.

690
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:13,028
- What I supposed you're not here either.
- I'm here...

691
01:03:13,231 --> 01:03:15,791
at Rekall.

692
01:03:19,671 --> 01:03:21,104
I love you.

693
01:03:21,306 --> 01:03:24,673
Right. That's why you tried to kill me.

694
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:28,744
No. I'd never do anything to hurt you.

695
01:03:28,947 --> 01:03:31,142
I want you to come back to me.

696
01:03:32,951 --> 01:03:36,187
- Bullshit.
- What's bullshit, Mr. Quaid?

697
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:40,590
That you're having a paranoid episode
triggered by acute neurochemical trauma?

698
01:03:40,758 --> 01:03:44,592
Or that you're really
an invincible secret agent from Mars...

699
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:49,267
who's the victim of an interplanetary
conspiracy to make him think...

700
01:03:49,267 --> 01:03:51,098
he's a lowly construction worker?

701
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:01,242
Stop punishing yourself, Doug.

702
01:04:01,412 --> 01:04:04,245
You're a fine, upstanding man.
you have a beautiful wife who loves you.

703
01:04:05,817 --> 01:04:07,682
Your whole life is ahead of you.

704
01:04:09,754 --> 01:04:12,348
But you've got to want to return to reality.

705
01:04:14,692 --> 01:04:17,354
Let's assume I do, Then what?

706
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:23,132
- Swallow this.
- What is it?

707
01:04:23,368 --> 01:04:27,099
It's a symbol of your desire
to return to reality.

708
01:04:27,305 --> 01:04:29,603
Inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.

709
01:04:33,645 --> 01:04:37,706
All right, let's say you're telling
the truth and this is all a dream.

710
01:04:37,849 --> 01:04:40,443
Then I could pull this trigger
and it won't matter.

711
01:04:40,652 --> 01:04:43,644
- Doug, don't.
- It won't make a slightest difference to me, Doug.

712
01:04:43,788 --> 01:04:48,248
But the consequences to you would be
devastating. In your mind I'll be dead.

713
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:51,691
With no one to guide you out,
you'll be stuck in permanent psychosis.

714
01:04:51,863 --> 01:04:54,127
Doug, let Dr. Edgemar help you.

715
01:04:54,298 --> 01:04:56,596
The walls of reality will come crashing down.

716
01:04:56,596 --> 01:05:02,397
One minute, you will be hero who saved rebel clause. And the next thing you konw,
you'll be Cohaagen's bosom buddy.

717
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:06,344
You'll even have fantasies about
alien civilizations, as you requested...

718
01:05:06,344 --> 01:05:08,972
but in the end,
back on earth you'll be lobotomized!

719
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:14,885
So get a grip on yourself, Doug,
and put down that gun!

720
01:05:21,259 --> 01:05:24,387
Good. Now take the pill
and put it in your mouth.

721
01:05:29,267 --> 01:05:31,326
Swallow it!

722
01:05:33,838 --> 01:05:36,329
Go ahead, sweetheart.

723
01:05:58,896 --> 01:06:02,195
Now you've done it.
Now you've done it!

724
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:25,652
That's for making me come to Mars.

725
01:06:26,991 --> 01:06:29,789
You know how much I hate this fucking planet!

726
01:06:32,463 --> 01:06:33,589
Cuff him.

727
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:43,602
- I got him.
- Good. Bring him down in the service elevator.

728
01:06:45,943 --> 01:06:47,376
Let's go.

729
01:08:01,585 --> 01:08:02,243
Fuck you!

730
01:08:12,964 --> 01:08:13,726
Doug.

731
01:08:15,867 --> 01:08:17,732
Honey...

732
01:08:17,969 --> 01:08:20,460
you wouldn't hurt me, would you, sweetheart?

733
01:08:22,373 --> 01:08:25,536
Sweetheart, be reasonable.

734
01:08:25,676 --> 01:08:27,667
After all, we're married.

735
01:08:33,417 --> 01:08:34,714
Consider that a divorce.

736
01:08:37,154 --> 01:08:38,781
That was your wife?

737
01:08:42,894 --> 01:08:44,122
What a bitch.

738
01:08:52,303 --> 01:08:54,168
Hey, get out of the way!

739
01:08:56,741 --> 01:08:59,266
I thought you didn't like me.

740
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:02,513
If Cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay.

741
01:09:02,513 --> 01:09:05,710
- Got it.
- So you've come back to apologize.

742
01:09:06,017 --> 01:09:08,008
Kuato wants to see you.

743
01:09:09,921 --> 01:09:11,149
Come on.

744
01:09:39,784 --> 01:09:41,342
- Now what?
- Jump!

745
01:10:11,082 --> 01:10:14,813
No! Don't do it!
you'll crack the fucking dome!

746
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:21,752
What are you trying to do, kill us?
The dome will crack!

747
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:34,962
Move!

748
01:10:37,108 --> 01:10:38,803
Taxi!

749
01:10:39,944 --> 01:10:41,775
Melina! Melina!

750
01:10:44,849 --> 01:10:46,373
- Need a ride?
- Last Resort, quick!

751
01:10:46,717 --> 01:10:48,048
You guys are going in circles.

752
01:10:53,190 --> 01:10:54,054
Jesus!

753
01:10:54,258 --> 01:10:56,556
Come on! You drive!

754
01:10:56,694 --> 01:10:57,718
You guys are in trouble?

755
01:10:57,862 --> 01:10:59,295
Go! Go!

756
01:11:10,341 --> 01:11:13,139
- What are you trying to do to me, Man?
- Shut up and drive!

757
01:11:13,344 --> 01:11:15,642
Hey, I got five kids to feed!

758
01:11:49,713 --> 01:11:50,805
Shit!

759
01:11:50,948 --> 01:11:52,677
No brakes!

760
01:11:52,883 --> 01:11:54,282
You idiot!

761
01:11:57,755 --> 01:11:58,619
What the hell are you doing?

762
01:12:11,235 --> 01:12:14,136
Christ! Now they're after me!

763
01:12:15,306 --> 01:12:16,898
Give me that!

764
01:12:17,108 --> 01:12:18,700
Get out of the way!

765
01:12:25,449 --> 01:12:26,746
Tony!

766
01:12:30,421 --> 01:12:32,821
Get out of the way!
come on!

767
01:12:32,990 --> 01:12:35,288
Come on! Come on!

768
01:12:38,863 --> 01:12:40,125
Thank you, Tony.

769
01:13:05,222 --> 01:13:07,281
Hey, you wanna, have some fun?

770
01:13:07,424 --> 01:13:08,626
Where are they?

771
01:13:08,626 --> 01:13:11,094
What are you talking about?
I don't know.

772
01:13:20,037 --> 01:13:21,197
Maybe you know.

773
01:13:28,179 --> 01:13:29,737
Kill them all!

774
01:13:44,028 --> 01:13:45,052
Thumbelina!

775
01:14:10,321 --> 01:14:11,789
Richter!

776
01:14:11,789 --> 01:14:14,883
- A call from Cohaagen!
- Richter here.

777
01:14:14,959 --> 01:14:17,792
- We've got them pinned down.
- Stop fighting and pull out.

778
01:14:18,295 --> 01:14:20,024
But they've got Quaid.
they're protecting him.

779
01:14:21,332 --> 01:14:24,165
Perfect.
get out of Sector G now.

780
01:14:24,768 --> 01:14:26,133
Don't think.

781
01:14:26,303 --> 01:14:28,965
- Do it!
- Yes, sir.

782
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:30,765
Pull'em out.

783
01:14:30,975 --> 01:14:33,136
Everybody, pull out!

784
01:14:33,310 --> 01:14:34,868
Move!

785
01:14:44,021 --> 01:14:46,819
- Cohaagen's sealing off the area!
- Come on, Benny!

786
01:15:47,885 --> 01:15:49,682
The first settlers are buried here.

787
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:53,721
They worked themselves to death, but
cohaagen ended up with all the money.

788
01:15:53,924 --> 01:15:56,654
He built cheap domes and watched
the kids turn into freaks.

789
01:15:56,827 --> 01:15:58,124
I saw them.

790
01:15:58,329 --> 01:16:00,797
And if you want to breathe,
you have to buy his air.

791
01:16:00,998 --> 01:16:02,522
Maybe you can change all that.

792
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:06,830
Hey, I think my grandpa might be here.

793
01:16:06,970 --> 01:16:08,539
So what can I do?

794
01:16:08,539 --> 01:16:11,064
Kuato's gonna make you remember some
things you knew when you were Hauser.

795
01:16:11,241 --> 01:16:13,903
- Like what?
- All sorts of things.

796
01:16:14,345 --> 01:16:17,212
- Like maybe you'll remember you loved me.
- I don't need Kuato for that.

797
01:16:18,582 --> 01:16:20,345
Since when?

798
01:16:30,394 --> 01:16:31,190
Freeze!

799
01:16:31,395 --> 01:16:33,522
Come on, Melina.

800
01:16:34,898 --> 01:16:36,297
Kuato's waiting.

801
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:38,593
Hey, I didn't find Grandpa, but--

802
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:41,403
Oh, shit.

803
01:16:41,572 --> 01:16:44,666
- Who's this?
- He helped us get away.

804
01:16:44,775 --> 01:16:50,405
Hey, don't worry about me, man.
I'm on your side.

805
01:16:59,656 --> 01:17:01,453
You're a mutant, huh?

806
01:17:01,658 --> 01:17:03,853
All right, let's go.

807
01:17:18,809 --> 01:17:21,607
- Have you tried ramming down the door?
- You wait here. Follow me.

808
01:17:21,945 --> 01:17:23,742
It won't do any good.

809
01:17:23,947 --> 01:17:27,280
- Cohaagen depressurized the tunnels.
- Then drill through to Section M.

810
01:17:27,451 --> 01:17:30,284
We can't.
we're running out of air.

811
01:17:30,487 --> 01:17:32,322
We need help.

812
01:17:32,322 --> 01:17:34,916
Okay, sit tight.
melina just got here with Quaid.

813
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:37,884
I hope he was worth it.

814
01:17:38,061 --> 01:17:39,653
So do I.

815
01:17:42,099 --> 01:17:43,896
- I'm glad you made it.
- You don't look glad.

816
01:17:44,101 --> 01:17:47,400
Cohaagen sealed up Venusville.
he shut off the air.

817
01:17:47,538 --> 01:17:49,699
You must know something
pretty damn important, Quaid.

818
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:51,642
He wants you.

819
01:17:51,642 --> 01:17:55,373
If we don't hand you over, everybody
in this sector will be dead by morning.

820
01:17:55,779 --> 01:17:57,371
Then we don't have much choice, do we.

821
01:17:57,548 --> 01:17:58,913
We can't turn him in.

822
01:18:00,083 --> 01:18:03,415
That's up to Kuato.
come with me, Quaid.

823
01:18:16,967 --> 01:18:18,764
Sit down.

824
01:18:18,969 --> 01:18:21,699
- Where's Kuato?
- On his way.

825
01:18:21,905 --> 01:18:24,430
You heard the rumors
about the Pyramid Mine?

826
01:18:24,608 --> 01:18:26,343
Yeah.

827
01:18:26,343 --> 01:18:29,574
Cohaagen found something weird inside
and it's got him scared shitless.

828
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:32,041
What? Aliens?

829
01:18:33,617 --> 01:18:36,484
- You tell me.
- I don't know.

830
01:18:36,687 --> 01:18:39,212
Yes, you do.
that's why we brought you here.

831
01:18:39,389 --> 01:18:41,789
Cohaagen's big secret
is buried in that black hole...

832
01:18:41,959 --> 01:18:43,790
you call a brain.

833
01:18:46,630 --> 01:18:48,495
And Kuato's gonna dig it out.

834
01:18:48,665 --> 01:18:51,869
- You're Kuato, right?
- Wrong.

835
01:18:51,869 --> 01:18:55,600
Kuato's a mutant,
so don't get upset when you see him.

836
01:19:34,711 --> 01:19:36,804
What do you want, Mr. Quaid?

837
01:19:37,781 --> 01:19:39,578
Same as you: to remember.

838
01:19:39,783 --> 01:19:42,411
But why?

839
01:19:42,619 --> 01:19:45,782
- To be myself again.
- You are what you do.

840
01:19:48,992 --> 01:19:52,222
A man is defined by his actions...

841
01:19:52,663 --> 01:19:54,654
not his memory.

842
01:19:55,933 --> 01:19:57,059
Please...

843
01:19:57,234 --> 01:19:59,327
take my hands.

844
01:20:04,641 --> 01:20:07,075
Now open your mind to me.

845
01:20:08,211 --> 01:20:09,678
Please.

846
01:20:12,516 --> 01:20:14,984
Open your mind.

847
01:20:17,454 --> 01:20:19,786
Open your mind.

848
01:20:21,992 --> 01:20:25,428
Open your mind.

849
01:20:27,197 --> 01:20:30,792
Open your mind.

850
01:20:32,803 --> 01:20:37,035
Open your mind.

851
01:21:07,304 --> 01:21:09,568
We should blow the thing up
before the rebels turn it on.

852
01:21:09,706 --> 01:21:12,300
I say we throw the switch
and see what happens.

853
01:21:12,442 --> 01:21:14,342
- Don't be an idiot.
- We can't risk it.

854
01:21:14,544 --> 01:21:17,138
The chain reaction could spread
to all the terbinium in the planet.

855
01:21:17,347 --> 01:21:20,317
That means a meltdown,
a meltdown on a planetary scale.

856
01:21:20,317 --> 01:21:22,444
Don't you think whoever
built this thing thought of that?

857
01:21:22,819 --> 01:21:26,084
Who knows what the hell they thought?
they weren't human.

858
01:21:26,223 --> 01:21:28,657
Maybe it's a trap.
maybe they want a meltdown.

859
01:21:28,825 --> 01:21:31,089
We don't even know
if this piece of junk will work.

860
01:21:31,228 --> 01:21:33,363
What is it?
a million? Half a million?

861
01:21:33,363 --> 01:21:36,491
- About half a million.
- Half a million years old.

862
01:21:37,067 --> 01:21:38,557
Let's make sure Kuato--

863
01:22:09,366 --> 01:22:13,200
Wake up! Wake up!
come on, wake up!

864
01:22:14,604 --> 01:22:17,164
They found us! Shit!
Let's go!

865
01:22:18,442 --> 01:22:20,501
Wake up! Snap out of it!
Now! Come on!

866
01:22:25,282 --> 01:22:26,510
They found us!

867
01:22:26,650 --> 01:22:28,140
- Everybody out!
- Melina!

868
01:22:28,318 --> 01:22:30,309
Get moving! Get out!

869
01:22:32,188 --> 01:22:32,913
Get out!

870
01:22:42,365 --> 01:22:44,230
Everybody out! Get out!

871
01:22:50,173 --> 01:22:52,471
Get to the air lock! Follow me!

872
01:22:54,944 --> 01:22:55,977
Benny, come on!

873
01:22:59,816 --> 01:23:02,410
- Benny!
- I'm coming!

874
01:23:21,605 --> 01:23:25,200
Put these spacesuits on!
we're going outside!

875
01:23:28,211 --> 01:23:29,735
Benny, hurry.

876
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:39,222
Congratulations, Quaid.

877
01:23:39,222 --> 01:23:41,383
You led us right to him.

878
01:23:41,792 --> 01:23:44,420
How can you do this?
you're a mutant.

879
01:23:45,529 --> 01:23:47,360
I got four kids to feed.

880
01:23:47,531 --> 01:23:49,556
So what happened to number five?

881
01:23:52,235 --> 01:23:54,635
Ah, shit, man. You got me.

882
01:23:54,838 --> 01:23:56,430
I ain't even married.

883
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:58,699
Now put your fucking hands in the air!

884
01:24:04,681 --> 01:24:06,114
Quaid.

885
01:24:08,285 --> 01:24:10,276
Quaid.

886
01:24:11,688 --> 01:24:16,022
Forget it, man.
his fortunetelling days are over.

887
01:24:17,994 --> 01:24:20,656
Start the reactor.

888
01:24:20,897 --> 01:24:22,694
Free Mars.

889
01:24:27,704 --> 01:24:30,229
Mr. Cohaagen would like to talk to you.

890
01:24:38,448 --> 01:24:40,712
So this is the great man.

891
01:24:45,755 --> 01:24:47,655
No wonder he kept out of sight.

892
01:24:50,026 --> 01:24:51,823
Well, my boy...

893
01:24:54,364 --> 01:24:55,262
you're a hero.

894
01:24:55,498 --> 01:24:56,396
Fuck you.

895
01:24:56,633 --> 01:25:00,262
Don't be modest.

896
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:04,702
The resistance has been completely wiped out,
and you were the key to the whole thing.

897
01:25:04,808 --> 01:25:06,207
He's lying.

898
01:25:07,077 --> 01:25:09,307
You two-faced bastard.

899
01:25:11,281 --> 01:25:14,717
You can't blame him, angel.
he's innocent.

900
01:25:16,519 --> 01:25:20,751
You see, Quaid, none of my people
could get close to Kuato.

901
01:25:20,891 --> 01:25:23,689
Fucking mutants
could always sniff us out.

902
01:25:23,894 --> 01:25:27,921
So Hauser and I sat down
and invented you, the perfect mole.

903
01:25:28,064 --> 01:25:31,329
You know you're lying.
hauser turned against you.

904
01:25:34,971 --> 01:25:36,768
That's what we wanted you to think.

905
01:25:37,274 --> 01:25:41,177
The fact is, Hauser volunteered
to become Doug Quaid.

906
01:25:41,177 --> 01:25:44,010
It was the only way to fool the psychics.

907
01:25:44,514 --> 01:25:45,845
Get your story straight.

908
01:25:46,016 --> 01:25:49,508
This idiot here has been trying to kill me
ever since l went to Rekall.

909
01:25:49,686 --> 01:25:51,813
You don't kill somebody
you're trying to plant.

910
01:25:51,955 --> 01:25:55,755
He wasn't in on it.
you set him off by going to Rekall.

911
01:25:55,959 --> 01:25:58,792
- So why am l still alive?
- We gave you lots of help.

912
01:25:58,962 --> 01:26:00,830
- Benny here.
- My pleasure, man.

913
01:26:00,830 --> 01:26:04,322
The guy with the suitcase,
the mask, the money...

914
01:26:04,601 --> 01:26:08,401
the message from Hauser,
all of that was set up by us.

915
01:26:08,738 --> 01:26:11,036
Sorry. Too perfect.

916
01:26:11,374 --> 01:26:12,841
Perfect, my ass!

917
01:26:12,909 --> 01:26:15,469
You pop your memory cap
before we can activate you.

918
01:26:15,612 --> 01:26:19,480
Richter goes hog-wild, screwing up
everything I spent a year planning.

919
01:26:19,716 --> 01:26:22,412
Frankly, I'm amazed it worked.

920
01:26:23,853 --> 01:26:25,286
Well, Cohaagen...

921
01:26:25,422 --> 01:26:29,280
I have to hand it to you.
It's the best mind-fuck yet.

922
01:26:30,293 --> 01:26:33,490
Well, don't take my word for it.

923
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:37,832
-Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
-Who is it this time?

924
01:26:37,867 --> 01:26:39,732
My mother?

925
01:26:41,905 --> 01:26:43,304
Howdy, Quaid.

926
01:26:43,506 --> 01:26:46,805
If you're listening to this,
that means Kuato is dead...

927
01:26:46,977 --> 01:26:49,343
and you have led us to him.

928
01:26:49,512 --> 01:26:51,281
I knew you wouldn't let me down.

929
01:26:51,281 --> 01:26:53,306
Sorry for the shit
I've put you through, but hey...

930
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:56,186
what are friends for?

931
01:26:56,186 --> 01:26:59,349
I would like to wish you happiness
and long life, old buddy...

932
01:26:59,622 --> 01:27:02,455
but unfortunately,
this is not gonna happen.

933
01:27:02,625 --> 01:27:06,686
You see, it's my body you've got there
and I want it back.

934
01:27:07,030 --> 01:27:11,330
Sorry to be an Indian giver,
but I was here first.

935
01:27:11,501 --> 01:27:13,901
So adios, amigo.

936
01:27:14,070 --> 01:27:17,335
And thanks for not getting yourself killed.

937
01:27:17,474 --> 01:27:19,840
Hey, maybe we'll meet in our dreams.

938
01:27:23,613 --> 01:27:25,444
You'll never know.

939
01:27:30,353 --> 01:27:32,344
You bastards!

940
01:27:50,607 --> 01:27:51,904
Let go of me!

941
01:28:08,058 --> 01:28:10,117
- Ready?
- Auto.

942
01:28:10,427 --> 01:28:13,089
- Check.
- Ready to go, sir.

943
01:28:15,231 --> 01:28:17,529
Relax, Quaid.

944
01:28:17,667 --> 01:28:20,830
- You'll like being Hauser.
- The guy's a fucking asshole.

945
01:28:20,970 --> 01:28:24,133
Not true.
He's one of my best friends.

946
01:28:24,274 --> 01:28:26,902
Besides, he's got a big house and a Mercedes.

947
01:28:27,444 --> 01:28:31,278
And you like Melina, right?
You'll get to fuck her every night.

948
01:28:31,481 --> 01:28:34,541
That's right.
She's going to be Hauser's babe.

949
01:28:34,651 --> 01:28:36,744
I'll bust his balls.

950
01:28:38,955 --> 01:28:41,116
Uh-uh, princess.

951
01:28:41,424 --> 01:28:43,593
We're having you fixed.

952
01:28:43,593 --> 01:28:46,824
You're gonna be respectful, compliant...

953
01:28:47,063 --> 01:28:50,499
and appreciative.
The way a woman should be.

954
01:28:54,637 --> 01:28:56,628
Mr. Cohaagen, telephone.

955
01:28:59,509 --> 01:29:00,942
Yes? What is it?

956
01:29:00,977 --> 01:29:03,707
Sir. The oxygen level
is bottoming out in Sector G.

957
01:29:03,813 --> 01:29:05,838
What do you want me to do about it?

958
01:29:06,249 --> 01:29:10,413
- Don't do anything.
- But they won't last an hour, sir.

959
01:29:10,553 --> 01:29:11,542
Fuck them.

960
01:29:11,688 --> 01:29:14,054
It'll be a good lesson to the others.

961
01:29:14,224 --> 01:29:16,818
Come on, Cohaagen! You got what you want.
give these people air.

962
01:29:17,026 --> 01:29:20,621
My friend, in five minutes
you won't give a shit about the people.

963
01:29:20,864 --> 01:29:21,956
Fire it up, Doc.

964
01:29:22,132 --> 01:29:24,123
Excuse me, Doctor.

965
01:29:24,467 --> 01:29:26,492
- Is he gonna remember any of this?
- Not a thing.

966
01:29:27,537 --> 01:29:28,697
Oh, really?

967
01:29:39,015 --> 01:29:41,539
Oh, Quaid, I'm having a party tonight.

968
01:29:41,539 --> 01:29:43,579
Why don't you and Melina drop by.
Remind him, Doc.

969
01:29:43,753 --> 01:29:45,983
- Sure.
- See you at the party.

970
01:30:00,670 --> 01:30:03,002
Keep still.
fighting just makes it hurt.

971
01:30:15,985 --> 01:30:18,715
If you don't keep still,
you'll end up psychotic.

972
01:30:22,992 --> 01:30:24,289
Hey, don't!

973
01:30:31,401 --> 01:30:32,993
Melina, hold on!

974
01:30:56,059 --> 01:30:59,290
Are you all right?
Are you still you?

975
01:30:59,395 --> 01:31:02,728
I'm not sure, dear.
What do you think?

976
01:31:05,835 --> 01:31:07,097
Let's get the hell out of here.

977
01:31:34,664 --> 01:31:36,791
You have to make a decision, sir.

978
01:31:47,443 --> 01:31:48,740
Kill him.

979
01:31:50,013 --> 01:31:51,878
It's about goddamn time.

980
01:32:43,933 --> 01:32:46,595
- Where are you going?
- To the reactor.

981
01:32:46,669 --> 01:32:50,332
- What reactor?
- The one in the mines. Come on!

982
01:32:50,439 --> 01:32:54,239
People are dying, Quaid!
Stop! We've got to get air!

983
01:32:54,744 --> 01:32:57,804
The reactor makes air.
that's Cohaagen's secret. Let's go.

984
01:32:57,947 --> 01:32:59,471
Where's this reactor come from?

985
01:32:59,648 --> 01:33:01,550
- Aliens built it.
- Aliens?

986
01:33:01,550 --> 01:33:04,747
- Are you sure about this?
- It's just up ahead.

987
01:33:07,690 --> 01:33:08,850
What the hell--

988
01:33:33,482 --> 01:33:34,312
Quaid!

989
01:33:34,483 --> 01:33:37,509
Hey, Quaid, you remember me?

990
01:33:37,653 --> 01:33:39,883
Benny! Benny's the name! Hahahaha.

991
01:33:54,103 --> 01:33:55,570
Oh, that's good!

992
01:34:01,310 --> 01:34:03,512
I'm gonna drill you, sucker!

993
01:34:03,512 --> 01:34:05,377
I'm gonna grind you up!

994
01:34:12,822 --> 01:34:14,722
I'm coming!

995
01:34:14,890 --> 01:34:16,482
I'm coming for you, baby!

996
01:34:32,707 --> 01:34:34,668
What the fuck is this?

997
01:34:40,850 --> 01:34:42,909
Damn this piece of Martian junk!

998
01:34:45,221 --> 01:34:47,689
Hey, Quaid,
I'm gonna squash you!

999
01:34:49,058 --> 01:34:50,855
Benny, here!

1000
01:34:54,163 --> 01:34:55,687
Where the fuck are you?

1001
01:35:01,570 --> 01:35:03,060
Screw you!

1002
01:35:09,245 --> 01:35:11,440
Quaid, get over here!

1003
01:35:11,580 --> 01:35:13,104
What is it?

1004
01:35:14,917 --> 01:35:15,906
There's an opening.

1005
01:35:16,385 --> 01:35:17,818
I knew it.

1006
01:35:46,715 --> 01:35:49,752
This whole thing is one big reactor
made out of terbinium.

1007
01:35:49,752 --> 01:35:53,153
Cohaagen knows it makes air.
the bastard won't turn it on.

1008
01:35:54,589 --> 01:35:55,115
Of course not.

1009
01:35:55,115 --> 01:35:57,690
If Mars had an atmosphere, he'd lose control.

1010
01:35:58,961 --> 01:36:00,394
See down there?

1011
01:36:01,630 --> 01:36:03,894
It's a glacier.

1012
01:36:04,066 --> 01:36:06,967
The whole core of Mars is ice.

1013
01:36:07,202 --> 01:36:09,602
The reactor melts it...

1014
01:36:09,672 --> 01:36:11,401
and it releases the oxygen.

1015
01:36:11,707 --> 01:36:12,935
Come on.

1016
01:36:12,975 --> 01:36:15,808
- Enough for everyone to breathe?
- Sure.

1017
01:36:16,145 --> 01:36:18,943
Enough for the whole planet.

1018
01:36:19,148 --> 01:36:21,378
If we turn it on on time.

1019
01:36:27,990 --> 01:36:29,821
Come on. Come on!

1020
01:36:47,142 --> 01:36:48,166
Hold on.

1021
01:37:19,608 --> 01:37:20,404
Now!

1022
01:37:51,073 --> 01:37:52,165
Son of a bitch.

1023
01:38:00,049 --> 01:38:00,606
Go!

1024
01:38:04,553 --> 01:38:06,612
He's got a hologram!

1025
01:38:28,544 --> 01:38:31,012
You think this is the real Quaid? It is.

1026
01:39:50,893 --> 01:39:52,952
Now, you're coming with me!

1027
01:40:06,808 --> 01:40:08,935
See you at the party, Richter.

1028
01:40:47,282 --> 01:40:48,408
Don't touch that!

1029
01:40:48,717 --> 01:40:50,378
Get away! Get back!

1030
01:40:50,752 --> 01:40:52,049
What are you afraid of?

1031
01:40:52,154 --> 01:40:54,418
- Turn it on.
- Impossible!

1032
01:40:54,723 --> 01:40:57,783
Once the reaction starts, it'll spread
to all the terbinium in the planet.

1033
01:40:57,926 --> 01:41:00,087
Mars will go into global meltdown.

1034
01:41:00,262 --> 01:41:02,856
That's why the aliens never turned it on.

1035
01:41:03,065 --> 01:41:04,965
And you expect me to believe you?

1036
01:41:05,234 --> 01:41:09,728
Who gives a shit what you believe?
In 30 seconds you'll be dead.

1037
01:41:09,905 --> 01:41:13,170
Then I'll blow this place up
and be home in time for corn flakes.

1038
01:41:16,144 --> 01:41:17,907
I didn't want it to end this way.

1039
01:41:17,980 --> 01:41:19,845
I wanted Hauser back. But no.

1040
01:41:21,383 --> 01:41:23,544
You had to be Quaid!

1041
01:41:23,652 --> 01:41:26,086
- I am Quaid.
- You're nothing!

1042
01:41:26,255 --> 01:41:29,281
You're nobody!
You're a stupid dream.

1043
01:41:29,424 --> 01:41:33,292
Well, all dreams come to an end.

1044
01:42:48,370 --> 01:42:50,100
Melina, hold on!

1045
01:42:50,206 --> 01:42:52,298
Don't do it!

1046
01:42:52,474 --> 01:42:54,305
We'll all die!

1047
01:42:55,344 --> 01:42:57,608
Everybody will die!

1048
01:44:00,842 --> 01:44:02,332
Quaid!

1049
01:49:17,692 --> 01:49:19,887
I can't believe it.
It's like a dream.

1050
01:49:21,529 --> 01:49:22,962
What's wrong?

1051
01:49:23,164 --> 01:49:26,827
I just had a terrible thought.
What if this is a dream?

1052
01:49:28,570 --> 01:49:31,471
Well, then kiss me quick before you wake up.
