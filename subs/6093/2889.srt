1
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,518
That year I was twelve,

2
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,754
I asked again where my parents are.

3
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,349
She finally told me the truth.

4
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,592
When my mother found out
about my father's affair,

5
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,593
she turned psychotic.

6
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,951
When I was one month old,

7
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,116
my mother stabbed my father to death.

8
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,512
And she tried to jump off
from the window with me.

9
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,398
Luckily the sister next door grabbed me
in time,

10
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,030
but my mother fell by herself and died.

11
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,510
I've been an orphan ever since.

12
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,872
Since then, I started living
with the sister who saved me.

13
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,152
I never got upset for being a orphan.

14
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,957
Because I have a loving and caring sister.

15
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,915
This one really got a mole.

16
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,432
That's right, before my mother died,
she told me that

17
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,039
I have a twin brother.

18
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,396
I always thought that we me on both sides
in the picture.

19
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,114
Don't worry, even a murder case
I could solve it splendidly.

20
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,555
Finding your brother is just
a piece of cake.

21
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,595
I know that.

22
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,114
I have read about your wonderful achievement
from the newspaper.

23
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,832
Excuse me, I got to take this call.

24
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,992
Chan T am Private Investigator.

25
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,670
Tam, I am Bulky.

26
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,595
You're getting famous now
and you already forgot your buddy.

27
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,556
Bulky.

28
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,199
We're buddy, stop teasing me.

29
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,510
Thanks for your help last time.

30
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,637
So you remember,
when will you settle the bill?

31
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,992
Bulky, I have a client now.

32
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,355
I will call you later
at the bank in a while, bye.

33
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,759
What were we talking about just now?

34
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,188
Chak, the superior is
so pleased that you solved

35
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,191
the murder case of Mok Wai Sum.

36
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,756
I'm now giving you a chance to learn
from Inspector Lo.

37
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,549
This will help your promotion
in the future.

38
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,553
Then you'll be inspector trainee
and I'll be senior inspector.

39
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,077
You two are partners from now on.

40
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,434
Yes, sir!

41
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,919
You should learn from me from now on,
there wouldn't be any problem.

42
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,876
Lo, how's the murder case going?

43
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,076
I've sent our informants
to get a line on it.

44
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,559
It'll soon be done, don't worry.

45
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,833
Good, wrap it up as soon as possible.

46
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,914
I've sent people to look for the officer
who investigated the missing case

47
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,353
of your parents.

48
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,668
But 1 0 years ago,

49
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,955
he was found having contact with
some drug dealers.

50
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,873
He was fired and went missing since then.

51
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,308
That's all you found?

52
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,913
That's it.

53
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,319
But don't worry,
I will do my best to track him down.

54
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,511
Hey, shouldn't you get promotion

55
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,833
for solving the murder case of Mok Wai Sum?
How come you don't get promoted?

56
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,352
I will get promoted but I don't know when.

57
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,313
Now I am under a prick

58
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,551
who takes all credits and dodges
all responsibilities.

59
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,518
Everyone knows that it's hard to perform
well being his subordinate.

60
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,155
But you'll see that I wouldn't let him

61
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,832
Iead me by the nose.

62
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,316
I want you to be my informant
for getting me a promotion.

63
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,678
No way.

64
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,149
You will get paid, punk.

65
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,390
Well, you didn't say it upfront.

66
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,398
Oh, by the way,

67
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,398
can't your team help you out at all?

68
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,835
They have been working for me
for over 1 0 years.

69
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,276
They should long be gone
if they were any more competent.

70
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,353
They can never be as smart
as the one-and-only Chan T am

71
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,428
Of course.

72
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,918
If it wasn't
for my serious nearsightedness...

73
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,271
I could be your boss as well.

74
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,278
Are you dreaming?

75
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,191
Now look into the case for me seriously.

76
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,038
The deceased, Lo Kwok Tung, 45 years old.

77
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,394
Without any wife or kid.

78
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,428
He died in his suite...

79
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,673
with his chest
and back stabbed over 20 times.

80
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,790
The weapon we found in the crime scene

81
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,996
is a fruit knife bent
from repeated stabbings.

82
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,389
There's no fingerprints on it.

83
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,829
There's no signs of robbery in the suite.

84
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,310
The neighbors said the deceased was
a sex maniac.

85
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,030
But there's one thing suspicious...

86
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,232
we found a posthumous letter in his room,

87
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,437
it seems to be left by his wife

88
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,872
And it read like this...

89
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,796
I have been married to him
for over 20 years

90
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,154
and we have our own kid too.

91
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,832
But he has an affair with another woman!

92
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,798
Staying alive could only make me suffer more.

93
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:40,072
I hate men!
I have to jump off the building with him!

94
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,389
Literally, his wife killed him.

95
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,310
But...

96
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,279
So we suspected that the murderer
is trying to divert our attention.

97
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,916
He is really trying to distract us.

98
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,195
But is the murderer a man or a woman?

99
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,908
Hey!

100
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,835
Come in.

101
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,069
(Thai) Hey!

102
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,395
He's one of us.

103
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,353
What do you mean?

104
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,510
He's my informant from Chinatown,
he's T am.

105
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,431
The so-called great detective
on the newspaper, right?

106
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,557
It's just vanity.

107
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,719
I can never as good as Officer Lo.

108
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,957
I'm here trying to learn from you.

109
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,510
Just look, keep your hands off.

110
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,353
Yes, sir!

111
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,514
How's it going?

112
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,511
The Indian discovered the body

113
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,388
The forensic expert says the female
deceased had been sexually assaulted.

114
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,875
There are bruises on her neck,
she should be strangled to death.

115
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,359
The case happened
in the small hours today.

116
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,519
We suspect the deceased was being

117
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,033
followed to the scene and got killed.

118
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,231
Chak, come here!

119
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,431
That lunatic is having his fits again.

120
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,232
Let's meet at nine in the bar.
We'd talk then.

121
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:35,797
Okay.

122
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,949
I'm coming!

123
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,908
What have you got?

124
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,436
The name of the deceased is Cheng Mei Fan,
32 years old.

125
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,749
At first we thought the deceased
was being raped.

126
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,831
But the forensic report says

127
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,388
the wound in her genitals

128
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,318
was caused by a wooden dowel found
in the crime scene.

129
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,549
And there's no fingerprints on it.

130
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,153
Is there the primary scene?

131
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,030
It's not very likely.

132
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,913
Because there're scratches on her back.

133
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,029
She might have been dragged on the floor.

134
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,319
These wounds were made after her death.

135
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,992
And I think...

136
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,235
the dowel...

137
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,754
it's just a garbage at the scene,

138
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,513
the murderer grabbed
it as weapon randomly...

139
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,637
Or is it left over by the murderer?

140
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,910
If there's no fingerprints on the dowel

141
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,994
it's left over by the murderer for sure.

142
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,956
Hey, you're doomed.

143
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,798
Damn, losing so soon.

144
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,119
One more game.

145
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,150
Is the deceased a hooker?

146
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,239
How do you know?

147
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,511
She really is.

148
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,955
She was hanging out so late in the night

149
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,798
with such outfit and makeup,
how could she be a decent woman?

150
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,791
You're right,
you know damned well about that.

151
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,799
I think everything in the scene
seems put together too deliberately.

152
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,955
As it the murderer intended
to leave those clues,

153
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,230
especially the wounds
on the victim's back,

154
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,355
for fear that no one would know
he moved the dead body.

155
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,430
If he wants to mislead the police
into believing that's the primary scene,

156
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,993
he wouldn't have done so.

157
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,675
He is trying to make you think that

158
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,433
it's not the primary scene.

159
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,629
This guy knows how things work
in the police,

160
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,316
he left those clues on purpose.

161
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,317
The murderer... might as well be a cop.

162
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,116
Hey, cut that crap.

163
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,995
He's not only a smart cop

164
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,517
but also a successful transgressor.

165
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,279
The murderer...

166
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,433
...might be an impotent sex pervert.

167
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,671
An able guy wouldn't use a dowel.

168
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,350
Hey, why are you looking at me?

169
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,634
Relax, I am not saying it's you.

170
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,869
Of course it's not me!

171
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:04,033
I mean you're not a smart cop.

172
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,397
But I'm not sure about your virility.

173
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,831
Nonsense!

174
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,912
I'm gonna wipe off all your pieces.

175
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,838
Really?

176
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,069
Cannon to the central!

177
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,752
Serious?

178
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,398
What now? Are you scared?

179
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,518
I'd like to defend first.

180
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,989
Call me impotent?
I'll show you what I got.

181
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,678
Hey.

182
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:39,231
(Thai) You still owe me money,
dare you borrow from me again?

183
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,193
(Thai) I told you to settle your debt first,
before I may consider another loan.

184
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,918
(Thai) I have been looking for you for so long.

185
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,678
(Thai) Let me tell you,
if you don't settle your debt,

186
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,109
(Thai) I will buy two coffins for you.

187
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,998
(Thai) One for you and one for your father.

188
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,515
(Thai) Got it?

189
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,636
(Thai) Enough talking. I am hanging up.

190
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,558
(Thai) What... what do you want from me?

191
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,551
(Thai) You want money?

192
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,074
What's new?

193
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,638
The deceased's name is Chuen,
he's a loan-shark.

194
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,439
The neighbors once heard him crying
for help.

195
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,355
Since he's always bullying others

196
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,396
and many people did owe him money,
everyone wants him dead.

197
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,872
No one came to his help.

198
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,951
His dead body was not found
until it started to stink.

199
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,710
The victim died from being
hit in the head by a hard object.

200
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,199
But no weapon is found in the scene.

201
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,113
The Identification Bureau is almost done.

202
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,999
Officer Lo,
why didn't you tell me to come earlier?

203
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,311
How dare you say that!
Do you still respect me as your superior?

204
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,353
You just know bringing newbie
to mess around.

205
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,150
Officer Lo, I don't look like
a newbie though.

206
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,432
I'm bringing someone to help
solve the case.

207
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,919
When the case is solved,
you can take all the credits...

208
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,560
Everyone knows that you're not taking
anyone under your wings.

209
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,912
What did you say?
I dare you say that again!

210
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,158
See if I'll file a complaint against you.

211
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,194
Say it.

212
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,158
Come on!

213
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,398
Sorry, sir. I was wrong.

214
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,678
Sorry, sir.

215
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,952
Officer Lo.

216
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,359
What is that?

217
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,629
Chak.

218
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,918
You dare to contradict your superior,

219
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,713
aren't you scared that
he will hold grudges against you?

220
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,199
That never crossed my mind.

221
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,510
I can swallow my pride
if he's insulting me,

222
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,751
but I can't deal with anyone badmouthing
my friends in my face.

223
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,712
What a friend!

224
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,189
By the way, the officer who investigated
the missing case of your parents

225
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,793
is Uncle Cheung.

226
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,879
A colleague of mine used to work with him
in the same police district.

227
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,916
I will tell him to look for Uncle Cheung.

228
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,191
I will let you know once I got anything.

229
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,912
Uncle Cheung?

230
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,635
I might have heard that name
when I was small.

231
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,237
Is his full name Cheung Suk Ping?

232
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,076
I have no idea what his full name is.

233
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,077
Okay, let's get back to the case.

234
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,990
My fellows told me that
they found many long hairs in the scene...

235
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,551
which are much longer than the victim's.

236
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,999
Maybe the murderer left them
during the struggle.

237
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,071
So I suspect that the murderer
would be a woman.

238
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,551
There are signs of fighting in the scene.

239
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,598
But the victim was so strong,

240
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,591
how could a woman possibly kill him?

241
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,353
Hey.

242
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,635
The hairs might not be left
by the murderer.

243
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,756
Maybe his girlfriend' left them?

244
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,794
Your have your own way of thinking.

245
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,598
Did you have that experience?

246
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,870
The hairs were already taken to the lab,
the report will be ready in two days.

247
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,911
The deceased was a loan-shark.

248
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,311
Maybe he got killed out of vengeance.

249
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,679
For those murder cases happened lately,

250
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,430
I don't think it's done
by the same person.

251
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,712
Because there's nothing
in common among them.

252
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,550
I think it's done by the same person.

253
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,792
The murderer didn't leave
any fingerprints

254
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,508
after the victims got killed.

255
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,229
And the motive for the killings
cannot be determined yet.

256
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,548
That's the common thread.

257
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,911
Huh? Is it a thread?

258
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,513
Sister.

259
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,240
Where... are you going?

260
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,874
You go home first, I'll be back later.

261
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:05,318
I've already lost my parents,
I can't lose my sister.

262
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,114
Sister, I bought you something to eat.

263
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,073
No, thanks. I already had dinner.

264
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,749
Why did you cut up the shirt like this?

265
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:38,949
Lo Kwok Tung, a single promiscuous guy.

266
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:44,754
Cheng Mei Fan,
a hooker who got sexually abused and killed.

267
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,430
Murderer's gender...

268
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,632
Chuen, 30 years old,
his genitals got cut off.

269
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,199
Why did the murderer

270
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,874
stick a dowel into the victim's virgin
in the second case?

271
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,597
These 3 cases

272
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,830
seem to be independent from each other

273
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,319
without any common link.

274
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,709
But how do you explain the posthumous letter
of the victim's wife?

275
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,233
There wasn't an established motive

276
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,675
or a specific target either.

277
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,637
The murderer knows
the Police's investigation very well.

278
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,711
If there's nothing related
between the 3 victims

279
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,836
and there's only one murderer,

280
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,676
why did he kill them in different ways?

281
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,072
We are in big trouble.

282
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:32,679
Stop that...

283
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,633
What is it?

284
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,397
What happened?

285
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,996
Who beat you like this?

286
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,877
What's going on?

287
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,711
Officer Lo, the identification bureau
just confirmed that

288
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,711
the hairs we found

289
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,119
in the scene of the loan-shark's case

290
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,838
belong to different women.

291
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,358
Did the reports say whose DNA those are?

292
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,193
It's done.

293
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,352
Two of them belongs to the two women
living next door to the victim.

294
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,075
But they have an alibi.

295
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,313
What did you get?

296
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,958
What's your name?

297
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,350
Why makes you think I am the murderer?

298
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,437
I just committed molesting though.

299
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,834
Leung Wai Yip, 40 years old.

300
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,829
If I am the murderer,

301
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,831
I wouldn't be caught so easily.

302
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,031
1.8 m in height...

303
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,718
Good afternoon, sir!

304
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,513
What is it?

305
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,675
Have a seat.

306
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,438
Yes, sir!

307
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,552
Are you Leung Wai Yip?

308
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,636
I once applied for the cadet school,

309
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,916
but I didn't make it.

310
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,715
I will help you
to get rid of those scumbags.

311
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,198
Give me a glass of water.

312
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,348
What's this?

313
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,512
Do I have to answer that too?

314
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,079
You don't have to.

315
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,831
Can you read this?

316
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,679
Leung Wai Yip.

317
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,948
44 years old, 1.8 m in height.

318
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,234
Graduated
in Olympic Memorial Elementary school.

319
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,673
Do your homework first.

320
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,275
Let's go.

321
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,793
Hey!

322
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,636
Sister, do you know...

323
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,234
father told me that he ddidn't like him.

324
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,916
What did you say? What father?

325
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,749
I'm poking you to death!...

326
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,917
Are you out of your mind?

327
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,948
You'd better go.

328
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,672
What are you doing?

329
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,278
What are you doing?

330
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,632
Today, someone slapped Keung on his face.

331
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,877
Don't be scared, dad will protect you.

332
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,713
Dad, you have to get revenge for me.

333
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,874
Keung relied
on his father's protection ever since.

334
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,955
Hey, what is it?

335
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,032
Why did you tell him so much?

336
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,197
Just lie to him.

337
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,958
Just let the stuff get confiscated,
got it?

338
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,635
Sister, can you keep your voice down?

339
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,631
You go home now and wait for me.

340
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,750
I'm making my call,
it's none of your freaking business.

341
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,519
What time is it now?

342
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,431
Why isn't the forensic expert here yet?
What's going on?

343
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,639
They got stuck on the road, sir!

344
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,279
They will arrive soon.

345
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,073
How's the situation?

346
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,909
This is Kiki, she's the fourth victim.

347
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,197
My district will be in deep shit
if it goes on like this.

348
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,758
Who is this Kiki?

349
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,399
She's just 1 8

350
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,875
but already the biggest drug dealer
in this area.

351
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,391
Many kids buy drugs from her.

352
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,319
As she died,
they will have no pills to pop.

353
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,075
We haven't got
any evidence to arrest her.

354
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,272
We could've thought...

355
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,313
Among prostitution, illegal gambling
and drug dealing, I hate the last one most.

356
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,110
The murderer may have done
a good deed though.

357
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,957
He got rid of the bad guys for you.

358
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,634
I will help you
to get rid of those scumbags.

359
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,913
Brother Chak.

360
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,511
I found a pair of scissors with bloodstain.

361
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,920
With pencil and scissors.

362
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,268
Chak!

363
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,636
Judged from the weapons in the scene,

364
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,517
can this murderer be a kid?

365
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,597
Pencil and scissors.

366
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,315
Can a kid kill someone?

367
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,919
How's that possible?

368
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,514
The fourth victim is a teenage girl.

369
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,038
Kiki, 1 8 years old.

370
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,192
Inferring from the weapons,
the murderer would probably be a kid.

371
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,154
Assuming these few cases were done
by the same person,

372
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,238
Why would the murderer appear
in different identities and genders?

373
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,790
30 dollars was missing
in my pocket yesterday.

374
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,037
Did you steal it?

375
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,751
I didn't.

376
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,150
My mom gave me my 30 dollars.

377
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,432
Sir, why would you think
it's your son the theft?

378
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:09,075
I did give him 30 dollars.

379
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,513
You gave him 30 dollars?

380
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,230
Then... is that you stole the monies
from me and gave them to him?

381
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,592
Madam was so mad when she heard,
she cried...

382
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,709
Hey.

383
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,195
Chak.

384
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,909
Check your suspects for anyone has
an insanity record?

385
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,792
Did you come up with anything?

386
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,678
Just go and check.

387
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,149
I suspect the murderer has
a split personality.

388
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,673
Trust me.

389
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:29,391
Early experience core training
clinical assumes,

390
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,875
a compensative strategy triggers
the incident.

391
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:37,034
Unhappy childhood experience
would lead to split personality.

392
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,229
Hello.

393
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,072
Tam, I got it.

394
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,310
There's a suspect Leung Wai Yip,

395
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,833
he took medication when giving
his statement.

396
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,919
I found out that's
a psychiatric prescription.

397
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,229
Give me his information,
I will check him out.

398
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,116
Okay.

399
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,315
Bye.

400
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,238
Leung Wai Yip.

401
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,877
Mental disorder.

402
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,078
A nutcase?

403
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,513
Don't be scared,
those crazy bastards are gone.

404
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,919
Sicko.

405
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,194
How dare you call me sicko!

406
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,193
How dare you call me nuts...

407
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,831
Scared, huh? Now be very afraid!

408
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,434
Those crazy bastards are gone,
how dare you call me sicko...

409
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,357
Help!

410
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,913
Stop that!

411
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,280
Madam, hold it right there!

412
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,032
That's her!

413
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,749
I've been wanting to kill her long ago.

414
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,070
You kill her for me.

415
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,517
I have been putting up with her
for so long.

416
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:41,275
Right, she deserves to die.

417
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,839
Wait!

418
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,993
You can't kill her with a knife.
You need a gun to finish her off.

419
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,392
Okay, please kill her for me.

420
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,034
Do it!

421
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,839
Hey, what are you looking at...

422
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,878
Call the police!

423
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,433
Why did you kill them?

424
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,551
I didn't kill them.
I just chopped them up.

425
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,558
Are you obsessed with the thought
to chop people up?

426
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,793
No, I'm not

427
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,831
I just wanna chop someone up
at that moment.

428
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,630
Do you want chop me up now?

429
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,599
No I don't.

430
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,990
Now I just want to chop that bitch up!

431
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,919
Wow, I thought I was so going to die
at that point.

432
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,231
I thought,
gee here comes another nutcase.

433
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,517
And he has a gun in his hand.
Luckily it wasn't a real one.

434
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,958
This handsome guy is so smart,

435
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,838
he faked crazy to save my life.

436
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:38,911
Smart my ass.
That's the only thing he's good at.

437
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,109
How was it? Are you alright?

438
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,760
How is it? What did you find out?
What did I find out?

439
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,876
Due to the lack of conclusive evidence,
we can't prosecute him.

440
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,791
He's got something wrong here.

441
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,996
I'll let the psychiatric department
to follow this.

442
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,798
Hey, T am!

443
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:54,916
If you weren't there,
I can't imagine what'd happen.

444
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,918
That's right.
He deserves to get a Good Citizen Award.

445
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,909
That's it? Just an award?

446
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,434
What do you mean, that's it?

447
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,199
He's a citizen, not a cop.

448
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,878
That's right, I'm not a cop.

449
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,954
But I'm much better
some dumb asses who are.

450
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,518
What are you laughing at?

451
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,633
Thank you!

452
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,315
The murderer might have
a split personality.

453
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,718
But what about his motive?

454
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,950
Why did he kill those unrelated people?

455
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,076
Is it something to do
with his problem childhood?

456
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,559
Hey, what's up?

457
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:23,155
Tam, I found a witness of the murder case
in the park.

458
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,515
She recognized one of our suspects.

459
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,118
Ling Ka Fai,
on the night of September 1 st 2009

460
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,909
from 1 1 :00 pm to 03:00 am,
where were you?

461
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,559
I don't remember.

462
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,155
I must be sleeping during
such late hours.

463
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,033
Can anyone testify you're sleeping
at that time?

464
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,396
My dad, mom and sister.

465
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,631
How can we find them?

466
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,231
I haven't seen my sister
for quite a while.

467
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:10,036
And according to your statement,
you said you don't have no parents.

468
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,068
Your first time identifying a suspect?

469
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,036
Yes.

470
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:27,157
Don't be afraid.
The suspects can't see your face.

471
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,877
They really can't see me?

472
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,713
You got your face all wrapped up.
How could they see you?

473
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,999
The key thing is,

474
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,231
you have to look at them carefully

475
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,834
and tell us when you're done.

476
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,749
Okay. Check them out one by one.

477
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,668
Did you recognize him?

478
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,115
Wait. Give me more time.

479
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,792
Okay, I memorize their faces one by one.

480
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,312
What should we do now?

481
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,029
Madam,

482
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,271
we didn't ask you to remember their faces.

483
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,874
We want you pick out

484
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,837
the murderer you saw that night.

485
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,958
Oh, you mean
I don't need to remember their faces?

486
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,113
I recognize him. Number 5...

487
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,791
and number 3.

488
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:01,029
Look again carefully.
Was it number 5 or 3?

489
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,034
If it wasn't number 5,
then it must be number 3.

490
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,638
Okay Madam,
can you tell me affirmatively once more

491
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,793
was it number 5 or number 3?

492
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,829
I can tell you for sure

493
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,191
if it wasn't number 3...

494
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,191
then it must be number 5.

495
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,430
Just now when I showed you the picture,
how come you said it was number 5?

496
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,630
Oh, was he the one in the picture?

497
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,678
The one in the picture looks like number 3.

498
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,079
T ake her out.

499
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,793
What should we do now?

500
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,149
What can we do?
Still lacking conclusive evidence.

501
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,872
Run over me!

502
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,915
Now you're trapped.

503
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,718
trapped...

504
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,071
Chak...

505
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,109
What?

506
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,839
How come it's you?

507
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,519
Tam...

508
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,830
Inspector Lo told me to warn you...

509
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,556
not to lay hands on this case any more.

510
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,270
Warn me?

511
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,355
You chased after me
so hard just to warn me?

512
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,515
T am, we're not planning to kill you.

513
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,316
We just want to scare your pants off.

514
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:37,835
Idiot!

515
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,992
I come for Inspector Lo.

516
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,918
Inspector Lo,
can I have a word with you out here?

517
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:02,996
You bastard! Douchebag...
Are you insane?

518
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:03,871
Are you out of your mind?

519
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,359
Just come after me.

520
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,000
He's your colleague,
how can you do this to him...

521
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:08,990
And you call yourself a man?
Shame on you.

522
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,069
Now stop it!

523
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,912
Or I'll charge you with assault against
a police officer!

524
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,871
Now think things through.

525
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,439
I wouldn't stir up shit like that even

526
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,596
if I don't get along with Chak.

527
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,195
I need to nail down that guy
who run him over.

528
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,949
Let me tell you, that guy is a nutcase.

529
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,156
He dares to mess with the police.

530
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,914
If you keep investigating the case,
you'll die first.

531
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,078
Let him in.

532
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,359
Hey.

533
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:51,037
What happened? Tell me.

534
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,834
I saw a black van

535
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,156
dashing toward me

536
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,635
and ran me over.

537
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:20,236
The van stopped and stayed there...

538
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,514
for quite a while.

539
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,712
And?

540
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,398
And then...

541
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:54,436
it seemed like...
it turned around to roll over me again.

542
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:01,594
I noticed that and I played dead.

543
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,237
Otherwise, I should have died.

544
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,439
He wouldn't hit you the second time.

545
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:22,596
He hit you with a van to fake it into
an accident.

546
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,913
Seemingly an accident.

547
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,794
T am, you have to stay out of it.

548
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,870
Simulating an accident...

549
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,279
Hey!

550
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,998
Are you okay?

551
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,671
You alright?

552
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,275
Do you really want to know the truth?

553
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:49,234
It's you again?

554
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:50,510
Here to arrest me again?

555
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,556
No, not really.

556
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,352
I come to apologize.

557
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,637
I hope you forgive me
for what I did last time.

558
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:09,551
I didn't want it that way either.

559
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:22,872
Your clothes are wrinkled.
You should iron it.

560
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:29,436
Sure. I didn't care much
about such things.

561
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,836
I wasn't like that at all.

562
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:39,271
The society pushed me into a corner
and I can't help it.

563
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,880
Well, how long have you been a cop?

564
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,629
I once applied for the police cadet school,
but they didn't accept me.

565
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,358
Really?

566
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,715
I'm not a cop too.

567
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,678
I applied to cadet school.

568
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:10,871
But I'm short-sighted,
so I wasn't accepted.

569
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:20,670
I used to hate doing the ironing.
What a drag.

570
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:24,751
We kind of get along, I suppose.

571
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:31,795
I'm Chan T am, let's be friends.

572
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,716
You need to pass a test to be my friend.

573
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,196
Which is?

574
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,231
You tricked me first!

575
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,590
Don't fight back
if you want to be a friend.

576
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:06,910
In fact, I'm here to ask for your help.

577
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,279
Once I had a friend.

578
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:19,392
He's an upright straight
forward dude just like you.

579
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:28,029
We didn't really keep in touch.
I want to find him now.

580
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,036
Is there a way I can find him?

581
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,872
You don't have to do anything.

582
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:40,835
Just wait for him to come to you.

583
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:42,558
But I'm running out of time.

584
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,197
Besides waiting...

585
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,032
what else can I do?

586
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:04,190
You just do the same things...

587
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:10,394
he did before.

588
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:02,759
Follow his footsteps to know his motive.

589
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,316
What's his motive?

590
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:09,876
Why did he cut off her tongue?

591
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:13,672
What about the posthumous letter?

592
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:50,595
What about the posthumous letter?

593
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:54,670
What about the posthumous letter?

594
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:08,554
It was written clearly...

595
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,278
Why ask?

596
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:14,558
You guys sleep
around with women all day...

597
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,196
You have to die with me.

598
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:22,155
What about the woman who got raped?

599
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,151
I couldn't control myself.

600
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:41,869
I remember I kept walking
after I killed her.

601
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,230
And I didn't know where I was going.

602
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:55,195
But when I calmed myself down,

603
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,636
I thought the woman deserved it.

604
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:22,028
I remember I kept walking
after I killed her.

605
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,150
And I didn't know where I was going.

606
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:30,230
But when I calmed myself down...

607
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,671
I still thought she deserved it.

608
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,035
There were so many people in this world.

609
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:37,549
Why me?
Why did he cut off her tongue?

610
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:40,115
All men should die.

611
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,870
Don't want to listen to them.

612
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:46,999
Adult always lies.

613
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:01,550
Why do people murder?

614
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:05,031
Is that all out of hatred?

615
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:12,000
Is that all out of hatred?

616
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:17,150
Does a murderer with split personality...

617
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:21,196
have a miserable childhood?

618
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:23,994
Is he an orphan like me?

619
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:28,917
No childhood is worse than being
an orphan.

620
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,438
An orphan...

621
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:43,951
With no parents...

622
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:01,911
Ling Ka Fai.

623
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:12,992
Hey, Chak.

624
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,834
Can you pass me details
on the suspect Ling Ka Fai?

625
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:18,038
Ling Ka Fai?

626
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:19,678
We did his background check.

627
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:24,117
He's just a mechanic, he has a sister.

628
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:26,351
There's nothing suspicious about him.

629
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:29,558
I know now, the murderer is an orphan.

630
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:35,350
He's an orphan
but it doesn't mean that he's the murderer.

631
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:41,512
We're just one more step away
from revealing the truth.

632
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,913
Tam, you'd better stay out of it.

633
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:50,551
Look at me. I'm now hospitalized.

634
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,717
I'm worried about you,
something might happen to you.

635
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,872
So, are you telling me to quit after
so much work?

636
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:58,075
You asked me for help at first.

637
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,678
Okay, okay.
I will get the information sent to you.

638
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,074
And...

639
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:09,039
I'll send you a necklace.
It's an amulet to keep you safe.

640
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:18,633
Sorry Miss, I need to be discharged.

641
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,434
No, you can't. You have to stay here for
a few more days.

642
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,239
T am.

643
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,428
Thanks.

644
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:45,837
Chak told me to pass it to you.

645
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,597
Ling Ka Fai!

646
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:20,799
Ling Ka Fai.

647
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,157
On a pitch dark street...

648
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:04,117
On a pitch dark street,
a woman shows up unexpectedly.

649
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:09,078
It looks like she's put herself
in a great danger.

650
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:15,115
Then things happen naturally
as the story unfolds.

651
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:25,956
A man who hurts a woman is unforgivable.

652
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:28,876
That will ruin a woman's life.

653
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:34,038
So a guy like that should pay
for his crime.

654
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:37,554
(Thai) What... What do you want?

655
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:39,394
(Thai) You want money?

656
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:48,755
And our hero has uphold justice.

657
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:51,349
But no one expects two police
impersonators would arrest our hero

658
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:53,510
and demand a statement from him.

659
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:58,759
Can our hero get away with it?

660
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:03,435
Ling Ka Fai, on September 1 st 2009

661
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:06,711
from 1 1 :00 pm to 03:00 am,
where were you?

662
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,153
I don't remember.

663
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:10,670
I must be sleeping during
such late hours.

664
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:14,837
Who can prove you're sleeping
at that time?

665
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:18,629
As the story goes,
the audience may want to know

666
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:21,359
who those two police impersonators are.

667
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:26,358
Our hero have to deal
with two more villains.

668
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:31,037
That would make them four in total.

669
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:58,159
I'm Chan Tam, I'm looking
for Ling Hoi Yee.

670
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,359
I am.

671
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:03,590
Has your brother Ling Ka Fai
contacted you lately?

672
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,670
What happened to him?

673
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,750
A cop dropped by and asked
about him a few days ago,

674
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,951
but they didn't tell me anything.

675
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:35,792
Do you know where he is?

676
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,750
I told your fellows already.

677
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,999
We haven't seen him for over 1 0 years.

678
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:46,510
I have no idea...

679
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:52,158
what he does or where he is.

680
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:56,439
We suspect he has something
to do with a few homicide cases.

681
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:08,273
You can't be serious.

682
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:11,398
How could that be true?

683
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:14,910
You haven't seen him for over 1 0 years.

684
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:18,795
Why didn't you keep in touch with him?

685
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,830
Did something happen?

686
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:39,519
Did something unusual happen to him
when he was a kid?

687
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:45,712
Not really.

688
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:50,230
He's just like any other kids.

689
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,911
without any difference.

690
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,351
I'll tell you honestly,

691
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,156
We've found a tape recording of
his killing process.

692
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:15,111
He's suspected to have killed
at least 4 people.

693
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:18,352
If you don't cooperate with us,

694
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:21,550
more people might get hurt.

695
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,235
Even you would be in danger.

696
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:57,791
What are you looking at?

697
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:13,159
If you find him, please let me know,
okay?

698
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,433
In fact...

699
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:25,552
I'm not his sister.

700
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:30,230
You mistaken your sentiments to me.

701
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:34,274
At that time, my father had an affair.

702
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:37,392
my mom couldn't get over it.

703
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,833
She killed my father
and then she jumped off the building.

704
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:49,718
What are you talking about?

705
01:18:56,120 --> 01:19:01,717
I was still young
and I had to support myself.

706
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:07,071
When I was 1 3,

707
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,195
I came home after work.

708
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:14,639
Someone grabbed me suddenly.

709
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,991
That guy was so strong,

710
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,311
he dragged me under the bridge

711
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:29,190
and raped me...

712
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:31,271
He raped me.

713
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:42,120
I was too young to make sense of
what had happened to me.

714
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:46,916
And my tummy got bigger and bigger.

715
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:49,917
Then I knew I was pregnant with him.

716
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:55,035
I really didn't know what to do.

717
01:19:56,320 --> 01:20:00,393
I gave birth at home.

718
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:03,631
When he was born,

719
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:07,558
I really wanted to kill him.

720
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:13,634
But when I saw him crying,
I just couldn't bring myself to do it.

721
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:19,151
I didn't expect that decision
would make him suffer.

722
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:24,748
I didn't want him to know
about his parentage.

723
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:27,952
So I lied to him.
I told him our parents died.

724
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:31,233
So those stories about mom
and dad were made up too?

725
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:40,592
As he grew up,
he seems turning into a different person.

726
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:48,950
I knew we couldn't go on like that.
So I told him the truth.

727
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:53,194
In fact, I am not your sister.

728
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:59,195
That's the last time I saw him.

729
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:08,908
I told a lie. Just a lie...

730
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:15,753
that ruins his whole life.

731
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:19,750
Why did he cut off her tongue?

732
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:23,036
Adult always lies.

733
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:36,636
He thought you were his sister.

734
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:42,878
In fact, you are his mother.

735
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:14,880
Chak, listen.

736
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:18,949
I just met Ling Ka Fai's sister,
she told me everything.

737
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:23,195
He projected his childhood experience
in the murders.

738
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:25,279
to re-enact again.

739
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:27,678
Who are you looking for?

740
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:33,393
Who are you?

741
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,432
Did you steal my stuff? Fake cop!

742
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:39,198
Now give it back!

743
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:41,794
I will...

744
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:45,713
How do I give you back the stuff?

745
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:48,917
Put it back where you found it.

746
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:51,550
Your friend is waiting for you.

747
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,077
Ling Ka Fai!

748
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:25,912
Ling Ka Fai

749
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:33,071
I have seen your sister, Ling Hoi Yee.

750
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,711
Who are you?

751
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:04,671
And who are you?

752
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:06,999
Ling Ka Fai.

753
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:13,352
I have seen your sister

754
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:18,394
I know everything.

755
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:30,592
T am, save that kid first.

756
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:39,278
Stop that.

757
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:42,274
Why didn't you get me later?

758
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:57,071
You guys just...

759
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:03,954
ruined my whole plan...
two more guys got involved.

760
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:11,358
Let the kid go.

761
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:16,238
Let him go?

762
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:21,915
He's an orphan, I am just helping him.

763
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:27,078
He doesn't have to be
so pathetic very soon.

764
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:31,836
Did you know that...

765
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:34,072
Did you know that

766
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:37,512
how miserable it is

767
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:40,350
how miserable it is

768
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:42,118
being an orphan...

769
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:44,871
How miserable?

770
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:50,910
I know that.

771
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:57,395
I'm an orphan too.

772
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:03,229
My parents were killed.

773
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:07,519
Liar...

774
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:09,279
You're lying!

775
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:11,272
No I'm not.

776
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:16,874
Why did you mess up my place?

777
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:20,350
Who are you?

778
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:34,230
What should I do?

779
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:39,790
Sister, mom, sister...

780
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:48,431
Mom.

781
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:51,395
What should I do?

782
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:56,800
What should I do?

783
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:05,196
Mom is here...

784
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:10,273
Mom is here

785
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:15,711
Are you alright?

786
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:21,674
Drop that gun.

787
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,192
Mom...

788
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:34,157
Then she must be my sister.

789
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:39,359
We're all here.

790
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:52,072
Haven't I found my mom already?

791
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:54,915
I'm not your mom! I'm a cop!

792
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,638
Do you believe in?

793
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:59,439
I'm now telling you this gun is a fake!

794
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:00,913
Do you believe it?

795
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,719
When I count to 3, we'd shoot together!
I dare you!

796
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:05,599
One!

797
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:07,953
Two!

798
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:10,430
Three!

799
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:24,231
Why didn't you shoot?

800
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:32,915
Isn't murder supposed to solve
every problem?

801
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:40,670
Why didn't you shoot?

802
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:54,758
I hate my mom for bringing me
to this world.

803
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:04,073
If she kills me at that time,

804
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:07,595
there wouldn't be so many problems.

805
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:14,192
Didn't you know...

806
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:21,951
killing solves every problem.

807
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:39,871
My radio drama

808
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:43,356
is just missing a gunshot sound effect

809
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:47,517
and it's done.

810
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:26,518
Chak...

811
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,711
Chak!

812
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:40,511
I'm returning it to you... hang in there.

813
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:42,913
Hang in there!

814
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:58,358
My radio drama is just missing
a gunshot...

815
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:02,312
and it's done.

816
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:17,711
Mom...

817
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:21,036
Then he's my sister.

818
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:24,072
Everyone is here.

819
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:05,913
Tam, save that kid first.

820
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:09,198
We grew up together.

821
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:11,669
I can tell what you're thinking
by the look in your eyes.

822
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:13,751
I can swallow my pride
if he's insulting me,

823
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:17,310
but I can't deal with anyone badmouthing
my friends in my face.

824
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:19,872
Be my informant.

825
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:21,672
No way.

826
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:24,356
You will get paid, punk.

827
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:26,716
Well, you didn't say it upfront.

828
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:21,920
When you were born,

829
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:27,596
I really wanted to kill you.

830
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:29,552
Shut up!

831
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:31,596
I don't want to hear anymore.

832
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:34,278
What do you want then?

833
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:37,515
So, the stories about mom
and dad were made up too?

834
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:43,956
How do I know
if you're telling the truth now?

835
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:50,798
Why didn't you kill me right
after I was born?

836
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:38,238
Are you Chan Tam?

837
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:40,711
Yes I am. How can I help you?

838
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:42,269
I'm Uncle Cheung.

839
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:45,079
Fung Chak sent someone
and he asked me to see you.

840
01:36:45,160 --> 01:36:46,752
It's about your parents.

841
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:08,951
I found out your parents
had connections

842
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:10,917
with a drug cartel...

843
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:15,075
and the kingpin of the cartel killed
your parents.

844
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:18,513
He emigrated to
Malaysia 20 years ago.

845
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:32,428
What did this kingpin have to do with
my parents?
