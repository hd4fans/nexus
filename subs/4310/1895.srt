00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,550
针对..
..during the class action suit

8
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,510
比利时海岸"宁静号"沉船事故,最近做出判决
against the mother company of Serenity, the ship that sank off the Belgium coast.

9
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,590
遇难者家属获得赔偿..
The families seeking damages for the loss of loved ones met a roadblock.

10
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,750
但遇难者家属之一皮特斯拒绝了..
One of those families, The Pieters, were not..

11
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,310
你干嘛翻我的东西?
Why are you going through my stuff?

12
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,550
当我小的时候,我就知道该怎么做
When I was a kid, and that was a 100 years ago and you'll never be my age,

13
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,350
如果你懂得..
but, we actually..

14
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,070
拿成绩单给我看就没事了
got the report card and took it home to our parents so they could see it.

15
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,990
妈妈从来不管我的闲事
Mom never went through my stuff.

16
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,110
-呃,我不是你妈-没错!
-Well, I mean, I'm not mom.-Yeah, no shit!

17
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,350
嘿!
Hey!

18
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,870
我找不到我的呼吸器
I can't find my filters.

19
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,190
如果你是呼吸器,你会待在哪?
Well, if you were a filter, where would you be?

20
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,030
你在说什么呢?
I don't even know what that means.

21
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,470
如果我是呼吸器..
If I were a filter..

22
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,310
我愿意待在柜子的第二层
I would be in the cabinet, on the second shelf.

23
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,630
我不允许你这学期不及格
I'm not having you flunk this semester, young lady!

24
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,390
那里面是牛奶!?
Is that milk in it?

25
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,430
爸爸,牛奶里的酶会引起过敏
Dad, milk enzymes cause food allergies.

26
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,430
妈妈用大豆做豆浆
Mom always used soy.

27
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,070
你喜欢那些基因改造大豆?
You'd rather drink a genetically modified bean?

28
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,030
明白了
Right.

29
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,510
-在美国你就拿这种成绩?-不是
-Did you get these kind of grades in the States?-No.

30
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,310
艾米,你愿意和我一起努力吗?
Amy, if we're gonna make this work, we both have to try.

31
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,910
是赛迪,我走了
That's Sadie, I gotta go.

32
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,270
就在今晚颁奖,别忘了!
It's my awards time already tonight. Can't forget.

33
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,590
好了,别迟到,好吗?
Alright. Don't be late, okay?

34
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,550
好,然后我们讨论一下你成绩单的事
Alright, and then we'll gonna talk about this report card.

35
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,390
什么?
What?

36
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,430
你不准备亲我吗?
You're not gonna kiss me goodbye?

37
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,790
当然会,我刚想这么做
Sure, of course I was, I was going to.

38
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,670
你好,沃尔特
Bonjour, Walter.

39
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,750
-我给你加了两块糖-啊,谢谢,洛根先生!
-I got you two sugars this time.-Ah, thanks, Mr.Logan!

40
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,990
我已经仔细查看过"哈尔盖特"安全系统
I thought Halgate owned the security devices we're testing.

41
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,070
你过来看看
I need you to look at this.

42
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,270
看见数字吗?看..
You read the number? Now, look.

43
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,100
我查了虹膜扫描的专利文献
I checked the patent for the iris scanner

44
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,830
看看原始图表是否有漏洞
to see if the original schematic reveal any weaknesses.

45
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,030
你知道我发现了什么?
You know what I found?

46
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,830
-有人弄错了,我们没有那个专利-那怎么可能?
-Somebody made a mistake, we don't own the patent.-No, how can that be?

47
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,390
我们必须查一下其他的专利,明白吗?
We must own these devices. Check the other patents, okay?

48
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,350
我们走吧
Let's go.

49
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,590
你叫我们去测试我们的保安系统
You asked us to review our security devices for flaws, so..

50
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,630
不输入密码,使用破解
if you don't have the pass code and wanna smash your way in..

51
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,510
锁的表面有一层聚合物
our smart locks burn into a hard polymer sealant here,

52
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,870
非常坚固,明白妈?
that permanently secures the lock. Okay?

53
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,660
我们没打算破解密码
We couldn't hack the pass codes,

54
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,470
加密算法没问题
these algorithms were some of the most secure we've encountered.

55
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,070
但是,我们发现
But, we found

56
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,870
把以下两种混合物
that if you first inject..

57
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,070
注入该装置硫化物和..
it's just a mix of ordinary household bleach

58
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,750
漂白剂的混合物
and sulfur compound in the mechanism..

59
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,070
哦,对不起,德里克
Oh, see, I'm sorry, Derek.

60
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,470
请继续
Please, go ahead.

61
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,550
锁就被破解了
The lock becomes useless,

62
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,510
我们必须找到一种解决方案
so we have to find a solution that isn't

63
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,470
阻止硫化反应
compromised by ordinary household bleach.

64
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,830
下一步
Next.

65
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,110
科勒先生?
Mr.Kohler? If you please..

66
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,270
最后一个系统
The last system.

67
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,350
哈尔盖特生物扫瞄系统,H1原型
Halgate biometric scanner, model H1P,

68
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,390
美国和欧州联合研制
providing level 3 security to U.S. military facilities in mainland Europe.

69
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,470
我们试过不同的破解模式
Now, we tried a variety of attacks to break in, and..

70
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,630
都没有成功,除非我们..
this one was tough, but one proved successful. We have a montage..

71
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,750
把50个虹膜,按特定的顺序扫瞄
of 50 specific irises in a specific group pattern.

72
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,310
开了!一眨眼的功夫
And you're in! Just brute force.

73
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,110
好极了!本,像往常一样
Excellent, Ben. As always.

74
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,990
我们将改正这个漏洞
Let's fix these flaws quickly, and..

75
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,350
把报告和那个虹膜序列发给我
please send me the video along with your report.

76
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,590
我会让我的团队跟进
I'll make sure our people get on this also.

77
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,190
谢谢
Thank you.

78
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,010
德里克,等一下
Derek, you got a second?

79
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:15,860
嗯,好的,本
Yeah, sure, Ben.

80
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,380
我想警告你
I think there's something you should know.

81
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,630
专利还没建档
Somebody forgot to file patents on these products.

82
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,470
专利?你怎么知道?
Patents? How do you know?

83
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,230
我们查看原始专利文献
Well, we pulled the original schematics to see if we could spot any weaknesses, and..

84
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,990
整个美国都依赖我们的保安系统
Personnel all over the world rely on the fact that our equipment is secure,

85
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,310
-如果它们不可靠..-我知道,本
-and that security is compromised with somebody..-I know what it means, Ben.

86
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,630
-真这么严重?-我们还在观察
-How bad is it?-Well, we got people looking into it.

87
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:38,710
好吧,呃..
Okay, well..

88
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,070
有进展就通知我,但不要告诉别人
Keep on it, keep me informed. Keep it between us.

89
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,070
我想今晚就看到你的详细报告

我的下一个照片集
It's my next photo essay.

123
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,990
你知道,人们到这里谋生,是因为他们在原来的国家混不下去
You know, people making life here because we screwed up whatever country they're from.

124
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,390
那是他们的原因,不是你的问题
Don't get caught up on other people's problems.

125
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,230
天,要是每个人都像你这么想那就不得了了!
Boy, what a world this would be if everyone thought like you!

126
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,750

-And you shouldn't be hanging out there.-And you should show up when you say you will.

127
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,110

128
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,310
知道吗?
You know what?

我今天收到电话账单了
I got the phone bill today.

132
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,830
打给你祖父就花了300欧元?

133
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,150

把拇指包起来

304
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,150

他试图联系过你吗?
Has he tried to contact you?

417
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,510
自从我们跟他切断关系后我就没跟本练联系过
I haven't spoken to Ben since we cut him loose.

418
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,990
发生什么事情了?
What's going on?

419
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,910
这是我们在布鲁塞尔的秘密安全屋
This is our black vault in Brussels.

420
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,150
我们保管着高度敏感的记录
We were using it as a repository for sensitive documentation.

421
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,110
两天前晚上的破门盗窃,有人闯入了
It was burgled two nights ago, by somebody who could break

422
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,430
我们最高防护的安全系统
our most advanced security systems.

423
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,110
这个圆筒装着高度机密的文件
That canister contained top-secret documents

424
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,950
美国司法部和..
we were collecting on behalf of The Department Of Justice

425
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,470
比利时的
in conjunction with the Belgian secret service.

426
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,990
有关什么?
Collecting evidence for what?

427
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,430
一个针对哈尔盖特集团在比利时的
It relates to a class action for negligence in Belgium

428
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,790
过失的集体诉讼
against The Halgate Group.

429
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,910
6个月前,他们的一艘商船沉没了
One of their merchant ships sank six months ago.

430
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,070
遇难者家属寻求赔偿
The families of the crewmen want compensation.

431
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,700
哈尔盖特集团愿意支付赔偿
Halgate is willing to settle,

432
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,310
但其中一个家庭拒绝妥协
but one family's holding out and putting together their case.

433
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,790
那个家庭的律师
The investigators for the family's lawyers

434
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,830
发现了一些诉讼案件背后的事情
discovered something bigger than a class action,

435
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,310
在货单中
something in the ship's manifest.

436
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,510
哈尔盖特与之有关联?
Incriminating Halgate?

437
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,990
从白宫发布的直接命令,这是最高度机密调查
On direct orders from the White House, this is a top level classified investigation.

438
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,030
你发现了什么?
What did you find?

439
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,030
确切的证据
A smoking gun.

440
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,950
有关哈尔盖特集团非法出口武器
That The Halgate Group was shipping illegal arms

441
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,910
为自己的利益引发政变
to destabilize countries for their own economic gain.

442
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:44,310
很自然,白宫认为颠覆他国政权是我们的工作
Naturally, the White House thinks it is our job to destabilize countries.

443
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,630
有人偷走了你的证据
Someone stole your smoking gun.

444
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,350
有人偷偷进入中情局总部
Someone breached into the CIA.

445
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,710
哈尔盖特是一个犯罪集团
Halgate is a criminal.

446
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,750
没有这个证据,针对哈尔盖特这个集团的调查就必须秘密进行
Without that evidence, the investigation against The Halgate Group will collapse.

447
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,310
涉及的利益实在太大
Stakes are too high.

448
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,830
我们只能继续调查那个洛根,一个高级保安系统专家
The only thing we have to go on is that Logan, a top security expert,

449
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,390
他当时在比利时
was in Belgium at the time of the break-in.

450
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,830
你能找到他吗?
Can you find him?

451
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,430
据说你和他有些私人关系
It's no secret you knew him intimately.

452
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,750
我懂了
I'll get on it.

453
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,270
德里克?
Derek?

454
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,550
你说过那事情不会发生的
You said this wouldn't happen.

455
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,830
什么不会发生?
What wouldn't happen?

456
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,150
你说过不会有人丧命的
You said no one was gonna die.

457
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,110
你错了!
This was all wrong!

458
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,390
-你是什么意思?-他们全都死了!
-And that means what?-It means they're all dead.

459
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,350
公司的全部雇员
The company, all the employees.

460
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,590
他们也想杀了我.你说只会给解雇通知书的!
And they're gonna kill me too. You said this would end in pink slips.

461
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,630
这不是解雇通知书!
This wasn't pink slips!

462
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:53,030
没我的允许不可能有任何擅自行动!
Nothing was supposed to go down without my approval!

463
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,670
他们把你剔除了
They cut you out of the equation.

464
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,590
谁给的命令?
Who gave the order?

465
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,070
布雷默
Braymer.

466
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,310
洛根在哪?
Where is Logan?

467
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,190
德里克,回答问题!
Derek, speak to me!

468
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:13,130
德里克!
Derek!

469
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,630
那个圆筒在你那里?
Did you secure the cargo?

470
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:22,150
对,在我这儿.但是现在,这件事要以我的方式来解决
Yeah, I have it. But now, this is gonna play out on my terms.

471
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,790
告诉布鲁塞尔领事馆,我会去当地召集人马
Tell the consulate in Brussels I'm coming in and raise a local team.

472
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,790
马上!
Now!

473
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,070
你妈妈和我想保护你
Your mom and I were trying to protect you.

474
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,510
是啊,远离真相
Yeah, from the truth.

475
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,790
爷爷知道吗?
Did grandpa know?

476
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,390
是的,他一直知道
Yeah, he always knew.

477
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,830
你在中情局是干什么的?
What exactly did you do for the CIA?

478
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:57,230
我帮助人们脱离..
I got people in and out of..

479
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,230
困境
difficult situations.

480
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,870
对不起,我们骗了你
I'm sorry we lied to you.

481
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,590
这张照片是你母亲拍的
Your mother took that photo.

482
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,350
对,她告诉过我
Yeah, she told me.

483
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,950
她知道我所不了解的事情
She could see things I never could.

484
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,830
我也想她
I miss her too.

485
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:36,390
-你为什么退出?-想成为一个真正的父亲
-Why'd you quit your job?-To be a father.

486
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,790
但我没有成功,对吗?
I'm not doing too good of a job of it, am I?

487
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,230
-我不确定-哦,真的?
-I wouldn't know.-Oh, really?

488
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,270
-我们不能回家,对吗?-对
-We can't go back home, can we?-No.

489
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,430
如果我们回家..
We go back home..

490
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,710
这些人找到我们两次,他们会再次找到我们
These people found us twice, they'll find us again.

491
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,270
这些人是谁?
Who are these people?

492
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,510
我不确定,我想我被利用了
I'm not sure. I think I was being used.

493
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,150
我只知道,这些设备过去都存在
All I know, those products were real.

494
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:06,190
如果不是哈尔盖特集团制造的,那就是另一个公司
And if Halgate wasn't making them, then somebody else was.

495
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,550
有人想让他们让步
Somebody wanted them compromised.

496
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,670
看这
Look at this.

497
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,590
这就是专利号码
That's a patent number.

498
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,470
它就刻在设备上面,我们必须搞清楚
It's etched into some of the products. We have to find out what's that all about.

499
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,430
那里就是我的办公室
Then there's my place of work.

500
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,430
这些地址,是线索
Addresses have owners, clues.

501
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:25,150
但我们目前必须先找到睡觉的地方
All we gotta do is figure out where we're to stay tonight.

502
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,550
可以给我些零钱吗?
Can I have some change?

503
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,350
纳比尔说他会帮忙的
Nabil said he'd help.

504
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,040
嗯?
Yes?

505
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,230
走吧
Come on.

506
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,710
卡里姆,这是我爸爸
Karim, this is my dad.

507
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,190
爸爸,这是纳比尔的哥哥,卡里姆
Dad, this is Nabil's brother, Karim.

508
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:08,830
你好,卡里姆
Hello, Karim.

509
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,270
很荣幸
It's a pleasure.

510
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:13,030
纳比尔说你会帮忙
Nabil said you'd help.

511
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,630
我说我愿意考虑
I said I'd think about it.

512
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,910
你在布鲁塞尔有藏身之处吗?
You found us a place in Brussels?

513
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:23,350
-我不会帮助罪犯-很好,因为我们不是罪犯
-I don't help criminals.-That's good, 'cause we're not criminals.

514
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,910
-可你们在逃亡-环境的牺牲品
-Yet you're fugitives.-Victims of circumstance.

515
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,510
2000欧元
2,000 euros.

516
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,430
付现金,预付一半,两个晚上
Cash. Half now, for two nights.

517
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,150
给我钱
Gimme the money.

518
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,870
纳比尔说你姐姐拿走了所有的钱,而你债台高筑
Nabil said your sister keeps all the money and you're up your ass in debt.

519
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,390
纳比尔太多话了
Nabil's got a big mouth.

520
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,430
你也应该改变自己
I suggest you change too.

521
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,030
快,我们走
Come on, let's go.

522
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:12,510
我女儿是你朋友,或者还有别的什么事情?
My daughter is just a friend or you want to tell me something?

523
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:14,990
不是,那是..
No, it's..

524
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,510
-嘿,你和他说什么?-去问他
-Hey, no fair, what'd you say?-Go ask him.

525
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,110
阿卜杜尔会给你们找个地方
Abdul will make sure you get a place.

526
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,390
看来,你可能比我更需要钱
And it seems to me, you probably need this more than I.

527
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,310
我们不会唯利是图
We are not all mercenaries.

528
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,470
他们是谁?
Who are they?

529
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,190
和你一样的流浪汉
You're not the only one on the run.

530
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,030
祝你好运
Good luck.

531
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,430
布鲁塞尔 比利时

532
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,150
好了,你们可以留下
It's okay, you can stay

533
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,510
两个晚上,在孩子的房间.行吗?
for two days in kids' rooms. Alright?

534
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:49,830
谢谢
Thank you.

535
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,910
在她生病期间
When she was sick,

536
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,390
她只提到你
you're all she talked about.

537
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:47,790
我想..
I think..

538
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,070
她仍爱你
I think she still loved you.

539
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:21,070
对不起,这么晚吵到你了
Sorry to get you guys up at this hour.

540
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,030
中情局安全机构 布鲁塞尔 比利时

541
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,910
我们在他公寓找到的
Everything we found in his apartment.

542
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:51,560
喂?
Hello?

543
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,790
你发现了什么?
What have you found?

544
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,510
他是被逐出境的前雇员,和他女儿生活在安特卫普
He was an expatriate living in Antwerp with his daughter.

545
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:03,350
记录显示,他两个月前来到这里,有商务签证
Records show, he moved here two months ago on a business visa.

546
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,950
别担心,我会找到他
Don't worry. I'll find him.

547
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,590
我觉得真的没有必要追究
My feeling is there's really no need to press

548
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,830
船上怎么会有破洞
for an excavation of the boat.

549
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,990
运输建筑材料常见的危险之一
Self-combustion is a common risk when you ship

550
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,550
就是自我燃烧
construction materials.

551
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,350
我相信我们会找到为这一悲剧事件补偿你们的方式
I'm sure we can find a way to compensate you for this tragic event.

552
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,110
不是钱的问题,布雷默先生
This is not about money, Mr.Braymer.

553
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,590
我想见哈尔盖特先生
I want Mr.Halgate

554
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:36,030
到这来,看着我的眼睛
to appear here personally and look me in the eye.

555
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,470
我要他对我儿子的死亡正式道歉
And I want him to apologize for my son's death.

556
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:47,750
你在哪儿?
Where are you?

557
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,590
你认为呢?
Where do you think?

558
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,870
你告诉我中情局那里有你想要的东西
You told me the CIA had something you wanted.

559
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,750
我已经有了
I arranged to get it.

560
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,310
-你为什么杀了这些人?-我们见个面
-Why did you murder these people?-Let's meet.

561
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,790
1个小时内..
One hour.

562
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,190
你终结了秘密行动
You dismantled the covert operation

563
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,910
我为你执行的行动
I was running for you.

564
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:15,390
你利用我的特工去杀人
You used my agents to kill.

565
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,590
你让洛根变成一个逃犯!你他妈究竟干嘛?
You've made Logan the subject of a manhunt! What the hell got into you?

566
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,630
他快要发现公司是假的了
He was about to find out the company was a fake.

567
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,630
是上面的决定
It was an executive decision.

568
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,470
洛根已经验证了专利
Logan was looking into the patents.

569
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,670
问起谁负责安保系统
Asking questions about who owned the security systems.

570
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:33,470
-你为什么让他参与?-因为你想要尽快完成!
-What possessed you to get him involved?-Because you wanted something done quick!

571
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:34,910
而他是最好的人选
And he's the best there is.

572
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,110
告诉我你还有证据吗?
Tell me you at least have the evidence.

573
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,270
你知道圆筒里是什么?
You know what was in the container?

574
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,350
-它在你手里?-我们正在努力
-Do you have it?-We're working on it.

575
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:48,110
圆筒在科勒手上,但我们找不到他,他不接电话
Kohler has the container but we can't find him, he's not answering his phone, he's..

576
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,310
他失踪了
He's gone.

577
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,870
你找不到科勒
You don't have Kohler.

578
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,910
你没有证据
You don't have the evidence.

579
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,270
-如果洛根知道真相..-他只是一个工程师
-If Logan finds out what we got him involved in..-He's just an engineer.

580
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:02,710
中情局黑色行动组的,你个白痴!我们没有单纯的工程师
CIA Black Ops, you idiot. We don't make engineers.

581
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,550
我们的头儿怀疑你对洛根的感情
Our employer wasn't sure your personal feelings for Logan

582
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,670
是否不会削弱你的判断力
wouldn't cloud your judgment in making the tough calls.

583
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,870
如果哈尔盖特完蛋,我也完蛋
If Halgate goes down, I go down.

584
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:17,030
如果洛根知道真相,不管你做多强的安全防范
No matter how much security you surround yourself with if Logan finds out,

585
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,470
你会找上你的.我能摆平这事!
he'll get to you. I can fix this!

586
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:22,910
找到科勒,把证据带回来
Find Kohler, bring in the evidence.

587
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,190
我们会给你他最新的所在地点
We'll get you his last known location.

588
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,270
那么本呢?
What about Ben?

589
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,790
我们叫一个专家来处理
We've got that covered. We brought in an expert.

590
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:32,830
-读出数字-好
-Give me the number.-Okay.

591
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,310
等一下,等一下
Hold on, hold on.

592
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,710
美国专利和商标局

593
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,790
-好了,给我专利号码-好的
-Alright. Give me the patent number now.-Okay.

594
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,710

00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:44,590
367
3-6-7.

596
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,430
美玲说对了
Mei Ling was right.

597
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:56,190
这个专利不属于哈尔盖特集团,而是属于纽约的"全方位安全"保安集团
Halgate doesn't own the patent. Belongs to Total Security in New York.

598
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:00,630
抄下来:785506..
Write that down: 785506.

599
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,950
中央情报局,需要帮忙吗?

600
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:20,030
中央情报局,需要帮忙吗?

601
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:26,910
听好了
Alright, are you ready for this?

602
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:32,230
你的办公室地址,是由哈尔盖特安全公司短期租借的
Your office address, the address for Halgate Security System was short-leased,

603
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:35,630

605
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,270
由布鲁塞尔本地的房产经纪人承租
by the same realtor, right here in Brussels.

606
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,630
-那个房产经纪人告诉你的?-对,我知道,他们想快点租出去
-The realtor just told you this?-Yeah, I know, they're dying to lease it.

607
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:49,110
我们必须加把劲了,因为周末了,经纪人很忙的
We gotta hurry, because it's Saturday and the realtor gets busy.

608

我们半个小时后见面
I put this at viewing in 30 minutes.

609
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,150
你以为自己是谁,侦探福尔摩斯?
Who you think you are, Sherlock Holmes?

610
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,790
我去拿我的包包
I'm gonna go get my bag.

611
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:28,270
你的上一个租客,你见过他吗?

612
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:31,350

当然
Sure.

615
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,030

-Wait, so he's not even alive?-No, he's been dead 5 years or so.

620
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,790
看来我任职于某家专卖公司
Looks like I was working for some kind of proprietary.

621
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,580
什么专卖公司?
What's a proprietary?

622
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:28,880
一个空壳公司,什么都不制造
It's a shell company, created to do one thing,

623
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:32,080
而事实上,他们在做完全不同的事情
when in reality, it's doing something completely different.

624
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,670
等等,为什么中情局给一个空壳公司申请专利?
So wait, why would the CIA file patents for a shell company?

625
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:38,430
艾米,等会儿再问,好吗?

别耍小聪明
Don't be a smart ass.

637
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,310
你是我的耳目,明白吗?
You're my eyes and ears, okay?

638
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:19,870
马库斯・沃尔夫是你的化名?
Markus Wolf is your alias, huh?

639
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,550
真有趣.下一次用什么,玛塔・哈里?
That's cute. What's next, Mata Hari?

640
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,670
你犯大错了!

你为谁工作?
Who are you working for?

648
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,110
趁还有时间,你快点离开,本!

01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,830
当我知道她安全的时候,你就会收到证据
When I know she's safe, you'll get your evidence.

832
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:50,150
我在听着
I'm listening.

833
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:53,870
拿着这手机,我会发简讯告诉你时间和地点
Keep this phone on you. I'll text you a time and a place.

834
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:13,590
等一下!
Hold it!

835
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:38,150
-我告诉你等等!-我必须跟他说话
-I told you to wait!-I need to speak to him.

836
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:40,310
-他在跟地区总裁开会-我才不管
-He's dealing with the regional president.-I don't give a shit.

837
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:43,030
他不和小角色讲话
He doesn't meet the help.

838
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:50,310
安娜!
Anna!

839
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:54,710
哈尔盖特先生?
Mr.Halgate?

840
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:58,590
-我不知道我们有预约-她要走了
-I didn't realize we had a one o'clock.-She was just leaving.

841
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:00,750
他要杀了你
He's going to kill you.

842
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:04,310
你一定就是善变的安娜・勃兰特
You must be the mercurial Anna Brandt.

843
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:05,830
-过奖!-你抓了那个女孩
-I'm honored!-You took the girl.

844
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:07,310
她在哪儿?
Where is she?

845
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:11,470
这么多麻烦就因为一个小事故!
So much trouble because of one little accident!

846
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:14,310
就为了一次沉船
Because one little ship sinks.

847
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:19,910
我4个小时后飞回芝加哥
I'm flying back to Chicago in exactly four hours.

848
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,630
我要在我离开前解决这件事
I need this fixed before I leave.

849
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:24,750
让我去交换,我了解本
Let me make the exchange. I know Ben.

850
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:28,310
看起来你很关心他的幸福,安娜
You seem very concerned about his welfare, Anna.

851
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:31,630
我为你放弃了我全部的事业
I've compromised my entire career for you.

852
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,710
为了那些幻想中的钱
For money that's in an account I can't touch

853
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,270
如果都安全
if this blows up.

854
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:39,430
在这情形下,我会做出适当的安排
I'll do whatever needs to be done to neutralize the situation.

855
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,550
你我的意见相同,安娜
You and I are cut from the same cloth, Anna.

856
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:45,630
我们知道如何达到我们的目标
We know what we want and how to get it.

857
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:49,590
我们能在需要的时候做出艰难的决定
We're capable of making the tough calls when required.

858
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:51,430
吉姆,你说我们可以自己做
Jim, you said we could do this ourselves.

859
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:56,470
是洛根
It's Logan.

860
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:59,430
司法部外面的纪念碑下
The monument by the Palace of Justice.

861
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:00,470
3点
At three.

862
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:03,390
-我去叫车-不需要
-I'll get the car.-There's no need.

863
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:06,790
我之所以来这个破地方
The only reason I came to this backwater,

864
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:10,910
是为了确保能带着我的证据离开
was to make sure I'm on the plane home with my evidence.

865
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:13,670
安娜会给我带来的
Anna will get it for me.

866
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:21,350
快跑,艾米!
Run, Amy!

867
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,030
快跑!
Run!

868
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:47,310
我现在叫车?
Shall I get the car now?

869
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:42,150
我告诉你必须一个人来
I thought I told you to come alone.

870
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:45,550
布雷默先生和我们的利益一致
Mr.Braymer is here to serve our mutual interests.

871
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:47,870
也许他能告诉我买下中情局要多少钱?
Maybe he can tell me how much it cost to buy the CIA?

872
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:50,230
毛重还是净重?
Are we talking gross or net?

873
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:52,510
她在哪儿?
Where is she?

874
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:56,070
你给我们要的,你会得到你想要的
You give us what we want, you'll get what you want.

875
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:59,750
你煽动发起了内战
You fan the flames of a civil war.

876
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:02,910
向各个部落出售武器
Selling weapons to tribal factions.

877
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:06,990
-为了什么?为了获取锂矿?-保护我们的利益
-For what? Access to lithium mines?-Protecting our interests.

878
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:10,310
在空闲时间里他们干什么,那是他们的事情
What these people did in their spare time, was their own business.

879
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:13,430
对,除非司法部准备调查你
Yeah, except The Justice Department was gonna figure you out.

880
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:15,800
所以你雇佣移民来做这个工作
So you hired a bunch of immigrants to do the work.

881
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:17,230
然后当他们越线了..
Then when they step out of line..

882
01:28:17,230 --> 01:28:19,270
-洛根先生!-他们就得死!
-Mr.Logan!-People have died!

883
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:21,510
所以你就能掩盖你们的所作所为
So you could cover your tracks.

884
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:24,310
信任
Trust,

885
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:25,670
洛根先生
Mr.Logan,

886
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:28,590
是一种宝贵的资源

887
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:54,870
给我那些文档,本
Give me the documents, Ben.

888
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:59,510
不要忽略现实,像安娜那样
Don't lose sight of reality, like Anna did.

889
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:03,790
-安娜在哪?-我只能说她不是一个团队的
-Where is Anna?-Let's just say she wasn't a team player.

890
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:09,150
丢掉你心里的道德罗盘吧,本,它能对你有什么帮助?
Don't let your noble moral compass get in the way, Ben. Where has it gotten you?

891
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:11,710
你一无所有
You have nothing.

892
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:13,470
没有工作
No job.

893
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,270
没有钱

894

没有国家
No country.

895
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:20,670
-把我女儿给我-不
-Give me my daughter.-No.

896
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:24,270
得用你..
It has to be you,

897
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,030
换她
for her.

898
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:30,070
-我们有过协议-现在我们重新谈判
-We had a deal.-And now we're negotiating terms.

899
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:32,550
哦,我相信你能理解我们的处境
Oh, I'm sure you can understand our position.

900
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:17,190
你好吗?他们伤害你了吗?
You okay? Did they hurt you?

901
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:21,470
看看你
Look at you.

902
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:32,750
-拿这这个-怎么回事?
-Take this.-What's going on?

903
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:34,390
你会没事的
You're gonna be just fine.

904
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:37,630
我要你走得远远的
I want you to leave and get as far away as you can.

905
01:30:38,690 --> 01:30:39,290
不
No.

906
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:41,670
我必须留下来
I have to stay here.

907
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:46,790
-不,你不能那么做,你..-我别无选择
-No, you can't do that, you..-I have no choice.

908
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:49,550
-这是我的使命-不,不是的!
-This is who I am.-No, it's not!

909
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:51,750
这就是我的用处
This is how I make a difference.

910

走!
Go.

911
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:28,870
不要遗憾
Don't have any second thoughts.

912
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:31,790
要不是你她不会获得自由
She'll never be free if you do.

913
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:35,590
我相信你忘了一些事情
I believe you've forgotten something.

914
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:49,150
你看起来不像中情局的人
You don't look like CIA.

915
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:51,870
你是英国人?军情六局的?
What are you, British? MI6?

916
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:53,830
克格勃?
KGB?

917
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,150
你的老板已经忘记了
Tell your boss he forgot a piece.

918
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:09,430
你不该就这么让那女孩走
You can't seriously let the girl go.

919
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:13,630
一星期.再找人"照顾"她祖父一个星期
A week. Send someone to take care of the grandfather too.

920
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:03,590
你到那儿就给我电话,好吗?

921
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:06,500
好的

你好!谢谢
