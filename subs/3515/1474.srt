1
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,730
Movement.

2
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,090
Two men.

3
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,140
Approximately

4
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,370
40 goats.

5
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,210
They're not on anybody's side.
We don't have to shoot them.

6
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,310
Egress?

7
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,880
Primary over the top, secondary
down the road, tertiary to the river.

8
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,380
No one can track you through the water
except a fish.

9
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,240
Sarah's headed off to nursing school
next month.

10
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,800
She sewed that herself.

11
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,270
It's beautiful.

12
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,710
You sure this is
a peacekeeping mission?

13
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,210
Normally there isn't any peace
to start with.

14
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,210
This shit's awful calm.

15
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:10,890
- Not at these coordinates.
- Yes, sir.

16
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,160
Go ahead and plot an alternate.

17
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,460
Yes, sir.

18
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,900
Command Post, Command Post,
this is TS-129, over.

19
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,640
Sir, I have visual confirmation
of TS-129's current position.

20
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,240
Mission accomplished, en route to
extract site. Distance eight klicks. Over.

21
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,250
Command Post, Command Post,
this is Viper.

22
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,680
I have friendly forces moving
towards extraction point, over.

23
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,220
Heads up, our boys are coming through.

24
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,150
Viper, this is CP. Be advised,

25
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,630
possible hostile forces approaching
TS-129 at their 12:00.

26
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,920
Call them out.

27
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,360
Target.

28
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,860
Sector Bravo, deep.

29
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,230
Vehicle, belt-fed weapon.

30
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,300
Range it.

31
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,600
870 yards and closing.

32
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,010
Wind, three-quarter value, push 2 left.

33
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,210
900 yards. Wide spot on the road.

34
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,950
On target.

35
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,390
Hold scope.

36
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:05,820
Fire when ready.

37
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,450
Hit.

38
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:19,290
Command Post, this is Viper.
Hostile threat down, over.

39
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,800
Viper, this is Command Post.
We copy your traffic, over.

40
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,520
Call it in. It's time to go.

41
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,520
Command Post, this is Viper.
Mission accomplished.

42
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,650
- Packing up.
- Shit!

43
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,120
Viper, be advised larger hostile forces
approaching near sector Bravo.

44
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,560
Werert supposed to be
hostiles that close!

45
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,970
Crooked tree.
675, 30 miles an hour, three-mil lead.

46
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,010
Position to machine gun.
900, three-quarter value.

47
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,450
Fire when ready.

48
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,550
Jefe. 920. Three-quarter value.

49
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,750
- I see it, Donnie. I see it.
- Fire when ready.

50
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,940
- They don't know where we are.
- But they might get lucky!

51
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,400
Command Post, Command Post,
this is Viper.

52
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,780
Enemy forces
have been stopped. Break.

53
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,610
Friendlies are continuing on
to extract point. Break.

54
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,620
We're receiving small arms and
indirect fire from hostile troops. Break.

55
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,790
Command Post, do you read me?

56
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,120
Shut it down.

57
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,360
They're highly-trained men,

58
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,220
eight kilometers inside a country
we are not supposed to be in.

59
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,660
I'm sure they'll get out just fine.
Shut it down now.

60
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,230
Radio check. Do you read me?

61
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,390
- Okay, wrap it up. Let's go!
- Do you read me?

62
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,170
- Pull out those tracks.
- Pull out those tracks and pack it up!

63
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,140
Intelligence said
they didn't have air support!

64
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,380
Call it in!

65
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,530
Shit! The channel's down!

66
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,650
That's impossible!

67
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,160
The comm link's dead!

68
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,100
They left us here.
Don't worry, we're getting home!

69
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:10,930
Donnie?

70
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,770
Donnie!

71
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,830
Come on, boy!

72
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,870
Come on, Sam!

73
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,800
What're you doing, huh?
What're you doing?

74
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,930
Come on.

75
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,140
What? I got nothing.

76
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,310
What?

77
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,510
All right, come on, let's go. Let's go.

78
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,250
That's a good boy.

79
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,920
Good boy.

80
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:25,540
Well, let's see what lies
they're trying to sell us today.

81
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,500
Here, boy.

82
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,140
Good boy.

83
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,190
Gunnery Sergeant Bob Lee Swagger.

84
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,790
USMC, retired.

85
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,260
He is the best there is.

86
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,960
His last assignment went wrong.

87
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:58,370
Put in unfriendly territory on a loan-out
and left as expendable.

88
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,910
Opposing force sent an attack
helicopter and a hundred-man company.

89
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,850
His best friend and spotter was killed.

90
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,210
No official report.

91
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,550
Ghost report says he inflicted
70 percent casualties, the rest fled.

92
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,750
The agency asset
that left them there to die?

93
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,020
Suddenly removed from
the face of the earth two weeks after.

94
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,030
They never laid it at Bob Lee's feet.

95
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,890
He retired a week later.

96
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,090
I guess Bob Lee didn't think
he was expendable.

97
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,540
Grows and shoots his own food.

98
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,840
Yeah, he rarely ventures out at all.

99
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:42,080
This is a man
with a history of duty and patriotism.

100
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:45,880
- Not as punch lines, but as core beliefs.
- Aye.

101
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:49,390
Some people don't know what to do
when their belief system collapses.

102
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,820
Bob Lee is one of those.

103
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,200
You sure, boy?

104
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:19,980
Nope. I ain't buying. I don't want any.

105
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:23,790
You guys turn around and go back
to wherever you came from.

106
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,060
Bob Lee Swagger?

107
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,190
My name is Colonel Isaac Johnson.

108
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,860
You're a hard man to find.

109
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,230
But not hard enough.

110
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,860
Come a long way to see you.

111
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,170
We have some business
needs your attention.

112
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,830
You wanna use your low gear
going down the road

113
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,030
or your brakes'll go.

114
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,010
- Come here. Come here, boy.
- Don't do that.

115
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:46,510
Come near the porch I didn't invite you,
you'd have to shoot the dog.

116
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,110
That's a slow draw you got there.

117
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,650
Sure you want to do that?

118
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,580
Shoot a dog in this county
on a mars land,

119
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,020
I'd bury you in the hill,
and tell the sheriff a month or two later.

120
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,250
He understands.

121
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,290
Take your hand off your weapon.

122
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,520
Slowly.

123
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,770
So the gunnery sergeant
doesn't have to bury you in the hill.

124
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,730
I don't carry a gun.

125
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,240
You know what that is?

126
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,240
It's a Congressional Medal of Honor.

127
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,370
They don't hand those out easy.

128
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,520
Yours?

129
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,220
Yeah.

130
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,310
Your father had one, didn't he?

131
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,940
What did you do?

132
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:27,790
Something foolhardy.
Kept some other boys alive.

133
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,660
Will you give me five minutes?

134
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,860
Yeah, your dog stays outside.

135
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,690
Come on, boy. Get in there.

136
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,330
I need you to plan
a presidential assassination.

137
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,460
Whose president?

138
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,600
Ours.

139
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,610
I didn't say "execute".

140
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,350
Plan.

141
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,210
So it can be stopped.

142
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,950
There's gonna be an attempt on the life
of the President in the next two weeks.

143
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,390
Code was broken
on an anonymous transmission.

144
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,060
It was internal.

145
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,530
We can't go to the usual agencies.

146
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,460
The government itself
has been penetrated.

147
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:14,030
The President has three
public engagements during that time.

148
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:18,630
Baltimore, Philadelphia,
Washington, D.C.

149
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,580
Standard Secret Service
protective cordon

150
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,510
is out to 880 yards.

151
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:29,280
But this intercept claims that the shot
will be taken from beyond a mile.

152
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:32,380
We need you to scout,
tell us how you would do it,

153
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,250
so we could stop it.

154
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:39,750
I'm not entirely convinced
that a shot like this could be made.

155
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,260
But let's not take the chance.

156
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,700
Your longer shots
were never confirmed.

157
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,700
That's because long shots
generally go places

158
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,640
you wouldn't wanna have
to go afterwards to confirm them.

159
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,340
Confirmatiors a desk pogue's problem.

160
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,440
You know what it takes
to make a shot at that range?

161
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,070
Everything comes into play that far.

162
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,280
Humidity, elevation, temperature,
wind, spindrift.

163
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,720
There's a 6- to10-second flight time

164
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,910
so you have to shoot
at where the target's going to be.

165
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,970
Even the Coriolis effect,
the spin of the Earth, comes into play.

166
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,460
President'll be wearing body amour.
That means a headshot,

167
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,720
at over a mile.

168
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,090
You believe there's a shooter involved
capable of making this shot?

169
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,430
Yes.

170
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,900
Well, then you got a real problem.
You need to find the shooter.

171
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,370
That's being worked on
from another direction.

172
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,230
We need you to do this.

173
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,310
Don't really like the President much.

174
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,310
Didrt like the one before
that much, either.

175
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,280
You like the idea of the President?

176
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,110
Living in a free country?

177
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,650
Do we allow America
to be ruled by thugs?

178
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,510
Sure, some years we do.

179
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,620
I believe you stood before a flag

180
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,390
and solemnly swore

181
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:46,160
that you'd support and defend
the Constitution of the United States

182
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,920
against all enemies,

183
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,660
foreign and domestic.

184
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,700
I think your five minutes is up.

185
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,700
Listen to me, son.

186
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,910
I don't want you to turn on the TV
next week

187
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,420
and see the President dead,

188
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,180
and know you could've done
something about it.

189
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,050
Don't do that to yourself.

190
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,640
Is that the new one?

191
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,010
The truck.

192
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,990
You got the big engine in there?

193
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:46,650
Wow, look at that, huh? Eight-liter V8.

194
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,450
Thing's so big, EPA doesn't even bother
to give you the gas mileage for it.

195
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,120
You mind if I take a picture?

196
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,460
This is beautiful.

197
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,700
Someone will be at this number
night or day.

198
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,510
You see what he did?
He didn't need a photo of the engine.

199
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,910
No, he doesn't give a rat's ass
about the engine.

200
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,540
He's trained in counterintel.

201
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,980
Backed up far enough
to take a picture of the plates.

202
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,580
This is our guy.

203
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,090
I thought he turned you down.

204
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:22,620
He said yes. He just doesn't know it yet.

205
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,560
1,760's a mile.

206
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,030
It's a far piece, Sam.
Think the President ought to worry?

207
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,460
Yeah, I think he better worry.

208
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,950
Yeah, he'll be fine.

209
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:39,080
Just feed him once a day. Read him
a few ballistics tables if he looks Ionely.

210
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,460
Yep. I'm out.

211
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,700
Come here, buddy.

212
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,630
Okay.

213
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:49,790
Think you'll be able to tough it out
without me for a couple days?

214
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,610
Yeah.

215
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,920
This is Command Post.
What's your status? Over.

216
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,860
Yeah, we're finishing up here on 6th.

217
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,760
Roger that. We copy.
Checkpoint down, over.

218
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:43,520
Before you stands Independence Hall,
the birthplace of the United States

219
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,520
and one of the most important buildings
in American history.

220
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,750
Built in 1732...

221
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,990
Keep a visual eye on 72nd...

222
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:55,660
...both the Declaration of Independence and
the U.S. Constitution were debated and signed here.

223
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,230
Out of the three cities,

224
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,280
there's only one with
a reasonably high chance of success.

225
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,170
There was no room in Baltimore.

226
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,710
Street isn't wide enough to correct
for the windage,

227
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,580
buildings are in the way.

228
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,210
D.C.'s a pure suicide mission.

229
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,240
I mean, unless you're sure
your shooter's interested

230
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,500
in 70 virgins waiting for him in the afterlife,

231
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,210
I'd rule that out.

232
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,450
Shot's got to be taken from Philly.

233
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,160
From beyond 1,800 yards, though.

234
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,730
It's one of six possible locations,

235
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:28,760
approximately five stories
above the President's location.

236
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,990
Flight time of the bullet that distance
is five to six seconds.

237
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,330
They'll have to wait
till he takes the podium,

238
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,960
several lines into his speech.

239
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,870
That way he'd be completely static,
obviously at his most exposed.

240
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,910
Shot requires a large-caliber weapon.

241
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,770
Expect the bullet to be handmade,
bronzed alloy turned on a lathe.

242
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,180
Slightly lower ballistics coefficient,

243
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,310
touch more slippery.

244
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,910
Least that's what I'd do.

245
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,350
You can kill him from that far away?

246
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,320
Mile and a half, the bullet's
going to strike with more energy

247
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,620
than a.44 Magnum point blank.

248
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,420
Yeah, I think you can kill him.

249
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,290
The challenge is the wind.

250
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,660
Lightest breeze uncorrected at that 
distance is enough to ruin the shot.

251
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:04,960
He's gonna need indicators between
the podium and the shooting position.

252
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,560
Velocity corrections are easy,

253
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,470
but an angle change,
that becomes a trig problem.

254
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,540
He's gotta do that in his head on the fly.

255
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,610
Without something to gauge, your shot's
just too tough to make cold bore.

256
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:16,770
Impressive recon and report, son.

257
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,910
Move too soon, we lose him.

258
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,310
We want to take him alive.

259
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:23,940
If we don't know who hired him,
it could just happen again.

260
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,520
We'll have six
three-man teams standing by.

261
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,220
Gunnery Sergeant Swagger?

262
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:33,460
A moment?

263
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:38,100
You've done your country
a great service, son.

264
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,190
- On the day...
- Look...

265
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,360
Listen.

266
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,770
You're one of the few people
who knows what to look for.

267
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,610
I could use a spotter.

268
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,410
Thank you, Philadelphia.

269
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,610
The President speaks in 20 minutes.

270
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,340
...before you on this stage...

271
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:03,110
Notify our teams. Check their positions.

272
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,310
...patriots met in Independence Hall
and created a document,

273
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,190
the Declaration of Independence...

274
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,420
Sir?

275
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,150
...and a country,
the United States of America,

276
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,690
that changed the world.

277
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,130
Philadelphia is our home. We are...

278
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,030
Stand by, all teams.
This is Listening Post.

279
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,900
Flashlight's current location
is approaching Checkpoint Jason.

280
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,500
All sniper teams
send update on your sitrep.

281
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:27,000
- Stand by.
- Yes, I have a clear line of sight.

282
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,370
Copy that.

283
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,850
Post 18 clear, over.

284
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:40,580
Post 19, please report.
What's your status?

285
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:44,020
All clear.
There's really nothing going on here.

286
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,560
The Archbishop of Ethiopia...

287
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,150
The President will be awarding
the Philadelphia Brotherhood Medal

288
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,930
to His Grace Desmond Mutumbo,
the Archbishop of Ethiopia.

289
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,600
There's been some controversy
surrounding the Archbishop

290
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,870
as he's been speaking out
regarding the atrocities in his country.

291
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:00,340
He plans to meet with the President
right after the ceremony

292
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,770
to discuss these matters.

293
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,180
These are great times.

294
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,410
These are historic times.

295
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,820
And these are troubled times, as well.

296
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,960
This medal that your country...

297
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,290
Yellow ribbons.

298
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,950
Yeah, people put those up
to remember the troops.

299
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,290
No, they tie those low around trees.

300
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,570
These are windage flags.

301
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,230
Roughly the location
I'd have put them in

302
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,830
for a shot from the steeple.

303
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:29,200
Yeah. Maybe.

304
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,360
No, definitely.
He knows what he's doing.

305
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,410
You guys got a team in place
to take out the church?

306
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:36,340
They'll move right before the shot
is taken, when his focus is elsewhere.

307
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:40,110
...raises its head
and confronts freedom,

308
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:45,550
but slyly, subtly,
chokes it off at the root.

309
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:49,350
And it is our responsibility

310
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,690
to find these dark weeds.

311
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,460
Flashlight has arrived.
I say again, Flashlight has arrived.

312
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,530
- Lf you just joined us...
- Hi.

313
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,270
Officer Timmons, our local resource.

314
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:05,870
Bob Lee Swagger.

315
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:10,740
It is a real honor to meet you.

316
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:12,540
You're unsnapped, officer.

317
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,010
Shit. Oh, fuck.

318
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,380
Don't want to lose that now, do I?

319
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:20,980
Again, it's an honor.

320
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:28,960
...of our stewardship of this great...

321
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:32,590
- That our guy in the collar?
- The Archbishop of Ethiopia.

322
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,970
He's getting a medal. Know it?

323
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:37,080
HOA. Horn of Africa. Yeah.

324
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:39,240
You know I worked there?

325
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,140
You know what they say
about the first thing that you feel

326
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,180
when you shoot a civilian, right?

327
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,580
- Recoil of your rifle?
- Right.

328
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,150
That's very original.

329
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:50,520
Thank you, Archbishop,
for those inspiring words.

330
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:53,110
The President speaks next.

331
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,490
All teams stand by.

332
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,920
Agent Gibson, we read your fly-by.
Situation all clear, over.

333
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,690
Agent James, all clear.

334
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,820
Now it gives me enormous pleasure...

335
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,870
- Got wind at three, full value.
...to introduce to you

336
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,940
the President of the United States.

337
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,130
Make it four-and-a-half minutes
of angle.

338
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,100
Three-mil hold, in case the wind dies.

339
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:38,360
He's loaded.

340
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:42,400
Altitude, humidity,
temperature accounted for.

341
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:46,110
In the city that was the capital of...

342
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,680
We got to take him.

343
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,240
Ten seconds.

344
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:52,010
Wind matches his setup.
Take him! Take him now!

345
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,510
Send in the ERT team. Take out the...

346
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,610
Shots fired! Shots fired!

347
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:15,200
Flashlight is down, Flashlight is down.

348
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,400
- What? Flashlight down?
- I say again. Flashlight is down.

349
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:20,530
- The President has been shot.
- There's mass confusion...

350
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:22,780
Has the President been shot?

351
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:26,640
Right at the church steeple.

352
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,450
How could you miss?

353
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,020
How could you fucking miss?

354
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,290
Thirty seconds, clear out.
Chase him down.

355
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,990
He's bleeding. Kill him.

356
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,030
Command Post to Condor Two,
load up, over.

357
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,600
Condor Two loading up.

358
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,260
Go, go, go, go, go!

359
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,550
Hurry up, guys. Come on.

360
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,360
Condor Two, this is Command Post.
Stand by for update, over.

361
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,830
Standing by, over.

362
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,900
Command Post!

363
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,330
Command Post!
Command Post, this is Post 19.

364
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,460
You guys read me?

365
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:22,630
- Should I hold post?
- Please.

366
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,000
Please help me. Please. They shot me.

367
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,370
- FBI. Put your hands up!
- Please. Hey.

368
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:30,580
Save me.

369
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:32,680
What?

370
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,260
Give me the keys.

371
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,020
I didn't shoot the President.
Timmons was a setup.

372
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:47,760
Help!

373
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,600
FBI! Took my weapon and my car.

374
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:59,200
Don't worry, I already shot him twice.
You all right?

375
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:03,140
CP, 17, can you repeat
possible suspect description?

376
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,270
Negative, no further at this time.

377
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,910
CP, this is 15.
No activity at my location.

378
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,080
I am available to move if necessary.

379
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,520
Copy that.

380
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,660
This is Officer Timmons
requesting backup.

381
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,690
Pursuing suspect in assassination.

382
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,930
Now fleeing in stolen FBI vehicle,
moving south on Front from Diamond.

383
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,660
Suspect is armed and dangerous.
I repeat,

384
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,890
suspect is armed and dangerous.

385
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,370
All Philly PD units be advised,

386
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:33,370
assassination suspect is fleeing
in a stolen FBI vehicle.

387
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,170
He is going south
on Front from Diamond.

388
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,250
This is Condor 2. We are transitioning
from roadhouse to Front Street.

389
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:41,540
Please advise for further description
of suspect vehicle.

390
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:44,950
Dispatch, 419,
I'm heading south on Thompson.

391
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:47,110
Do we have a color,
anything on the vehicle?

392
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,390
Assassination suspect's vehicle

393
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:59,330
is one government-issue
black 2006 Ford Crown Vic.

394
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:05,100
Pennsylvania license number
7-3-1-7 James David Edward, over.

395
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,340
What was suspect's
last known location? Over.

396
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,640
Last known is south on Front.

397
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:20,480
This is Agent James. Do we have
multiple suspects or a single suspect?

398
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:25,090
Agent James, negative.
No further information...

399
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:28,820
This is Agent Pittman.
Car seen going high speed on Castor.

400
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,990
High speed on Castor. Be advised.

401
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:38,970
Timmons called it in?

402
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,310
Right on time, like he was supposed to.

403
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,140
- Before he shot him again.
- Yeah, well, he's been hit twice,

404
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:45,980
so unless he can stop the bleeding
without going to the hospital or a doctor,

405
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,210
it doesn't really matter.

406
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,280
They're going to find him lying dead
by a dumpster in an alley in 20 minutes.

407
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,420
What is your location?

408
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,860
Suspect vehicle a black sedan,
four-door...

409
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,840
All units be advised,

410
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:27,390
eyewitness reports suspect vehicle
entering High-Tech Car Wash

411
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:30,320
on the northwest corner
of Girard and 9th, over.

412
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:31,390
Command Post be advised,

413
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,930
this is Condor Two en route
to suspect location, over.

414
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:36,520
Command Post, Condor Three copies.
All en route.

415
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,000
- Yo, man!
- Watch it, man!

416
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:04,380
Shit!

417
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:24,040
Command Post, Condors Two
and Three moving to intercept, over.

418
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:59,410
Suspect vehicle collided with a truck
under the 95.

419
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,310
He's at Market and Columbus.

420
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,650
Looks good. Vehicle is disabled.
Repeat, vehicle disabled.

421
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,660
Take him down! Fire!

422
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,020
I got a Crown Vic. Black.
Government plates.

423
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:49,220
Dead guy in the front seat?

424
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:56,830
I want the banks of this river lined
for 30 miles, five minutes ago.

425
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:59,010
All right.
Let's start the search downriver.

426
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,360
I'm here with Officer Timmons,
who pursued the suspect on foot.

427
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,030
Officer, can you tell us what happened?

428
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:09,170
The would-be assassin,
tentatively identified

429
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:12,760
as retired Marine Gunnery Sergeant
Bob Lee Swagger,

430
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,740
is being pursued by thousands of State and
Federal law enforcement personnel as we speak.

431
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:22,580
As the net begins to tighten nationwide,
there is still no trace of Swagger.

432
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:24,980
Nothing but an abandoned car
has been found

433
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:26,950
at the bottom of the Delaware River.

434
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:30,690
Seven-year veteran Philadelphia
police officer Stanley Timmons,

435
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,280
first to respond to the scene,

436
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,390
is believed to have shot
and injured Swagger.

437
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:40,760
Early reports indicate that the assailant
may have been hit as many as two times.

438
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:43,600
Meanwhile, the FBI has been
unwilling to comment

439
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:46,000
on information that an agent of theirs

440
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:50,240
was assaulted and disarmed
by Swagger as he fled the scene,

441
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:52,810
possibly in a stolen FBI vehicle.

442
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,440
At this time, no sign of Swagger
has been found.

443
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:58,610
You have embarrassed this office.

444
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,120
You will be facing a review from the
Office of Professional Responsibility.

445
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,210
Sir...

446
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,530
Well, I don't feel embarrassed.

447
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,560
A Force Recon Marine Scout Sniper

448
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:12,570
disarmed me three weeks
out of the academy.

449
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:15,830
If anything, I feel lucky to be alive.

450
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,780
Why'd he say
he didn't shoot the President?

451
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,250
Because he didn't.

452
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,990
Also, he said Timmons was a setup.

453
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:35,420
He never said that.

454
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,650
City cop managed to spot,
shoot this guy twice.

455
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,250
You got your ass kicked.

456
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,760
You're misremembering.

457
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,600
That's normal
under extreme stress events.

458
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,500
Have you given
your official statement yet?

459
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,590
Because I would be very cautious
about what went in it.

460
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:53,870
Well, maybe I should wait for the report
to come out, read it and then remember.

461
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,140
Can you believe this fucking guy?

462
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,740
There you go.

463
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,610
- Yes?
- The raw feeds are in

464
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,620
from the networks.

465
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:24,570
...development, security camera footage
from Washington, D.C.

466
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,640
And several locations in Philadelphia

467
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:29,970
shows the suspect,
Gunnery Sergeant Bob Lee Swagger,

468
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:34,040
scouting shooting locations,
traveling and taking wind readings.

469
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:39,020
As the net begins to tighten nationwide,
there is still no trace of Swagger.

470
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:09,810
Excuse me.

471
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,010
Can't sell you nothing.
Just lost our power.

472
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,350
Please. I got cash,
and you can keep the change.

473
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,190
Ain't gonna be able to find nothing.

474
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,760
Please, all I need is a marinade needle,
some salt, some sugar,

475
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,330
couple bottles of water.

476
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,250
How many?

477
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:12,340
Well, sir, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to hear that.

478
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:14,940
I'm sure she's
a really nice Christian woman

479
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:17,880
but we don't take care
of those things here.

480
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:20,050
- Yeah. Okay, well...
- The FBI released a video letter...

481
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,180
...see a counselor.
...threatening the life of the President...

482
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:22,970
Dr. Phil or something. Okay.

483
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:25,690
...signed and dated
by Bob Lee Swagger just 10 days ago.

484
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:30,690
Federal agents today executed a search
warrant in the Wind River range of Wyoming

485
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,700
where Swagger had been living
for several years.

486
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,200
In the meantime, the FBI
has been unwilling to comment,

487
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:39,640
as no sign of Swagger has been found.

488
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,940
- Get anything?
- No.

489
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,400
Yeah, wait, wait. Where was this?

490
00:42:58,920 --> 00:42:59,950
And? Yes?

491
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:03,220
She thinks it was him, but it was dark
because the power was out in the store.

492
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,660
- What'd he buy?
- Gotta be.

493
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,750
Salt, sugar, water,
and a marinade injector.

494
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,230
Guy going to a barbecue.

495
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:11,930
Salt, water, an injector could be used
for an IV,

496
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:13,090
but what's with the sugar?

497
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,460
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hold that! Hold that!

498
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:16,160
Well, sugar's been used to treat
battlefield wounds

499
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:17,240
for hundreds of years.

500
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,570
It has something to do
with osmotic pressure.

501
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,110
It was popular
during the Napoleonic War.

502
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:24,680
You go into Howard's office
with the Napoleonic War,

503
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:25,970
he's gonna put you on psych leave.

504
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,310
Go back to your desk.
I'm saving your life.

505
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:51,240
One thing is...

506
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:59,210
...1790 to 1800.

507
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:01,520
One thing is...

508
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:19,120
I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am.

509
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:20,660
I know who you are.

510
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,630
You're Bob Lee. Swagger.
Donnie's old partner.

511
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:26,360
Look, I didn't shoot the President.

512
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:27,560
I know.

513
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:28,660
You do?

514
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:32,300
The President's not dead.
Ethiopian Archbishop is.

515
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,900
Why in the hell
would somebody want to shoot him?

516
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:38,770
Look, you're a nurse, right?

517
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,480
No. No, that was Donnie's dream.
I couldn't stand the blood.

518
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:44,780
I teach the third grade.

519
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:47,080
- Please.
- Look, you should go.

520
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:49,550
Please.

521
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:51,880
I didn't do whatever they said I did.

522
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:53,460
I swear.

523
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,190
I'm in some bad trouble
and I need some help.

524
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,820
I wouldn't have come all the way here
to lie to you.

525
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:05,000
You still figuring on shooting me?

526
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:07,910
Only that shotgurs a little long
to bring up fast.

527
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:11,140
Look, if you're going to do it,
just get it over with.

528
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:13,210
I ain't got nowhere else to go.

529
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:20,180
Pull the truck in the garage.
The neighbors'll be up in a minute.

530
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:21,810
You'd best call me Sarah.

531
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,120
All right.

532
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,600
911, what's your emergency?

533
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,330
Hello?

534
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,270
This is 911. We received a hang-up
from this location.

535
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:14,900
Yeah, neighbor's dog knocked over
the trash cans

536
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:17,500
and scared the hell out of me.
Everything's fine. Thanks.

537
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:18,580
Okay, then.

538
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:27,850
Seems you call the police and hang up
without saying anything,

539
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,020
they call you back right away.

540
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:38,630
I should've come
and seen you in person.

541
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:44,040
Before. I mean, then.

542
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:45,500
Yeah, I read the letter.

543
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:48,870
It was okay.

544
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:53,140
And once a year I got the flowers.

545
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,170
You don't look real good.

546
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:02,490
I'm supposed to be dead.
Been a long night.

547
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:04,560
Why aren't you?

548
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:07,030
Well, the U.S. Government spent
a lot of time and money

549
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:08,930
teaching me how not to die

550
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:11,520
after they got done teaching me
how to kill people.

551
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,230
So how is it I'm supposed to help you?

552
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:20,700
You can do a running cross-stitch,
finish it with an embroidery knot?

553
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:21,780
Yeah.

554
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,710
You got to try to spread it out.

555
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:36,190
It's gonna look odd
you buy it all in one place.

556
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:47,130
How can it be three years ago
when it seems like ten?

557
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,670
Mileage can be rough.

558
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:05,810
No one ever beats me in.

559
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:14,460
You never left.

560
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,490
Everyone keeps telling me I'm crazy.

561
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,730
Like I didn't see what I saw,
or heard what I heard.

562
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,270
I'm not crazy, though.
You think I'm crazy?

563
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,770
Where did all this stuff come from?

564
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:31,270
At first I thought
it was Washington, Quantico.

565
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,580
I checked and it didn't.
It just magically arrived.

566
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:40,090
Cooperating agencies, ATF, NRO,
places that don't even have initials

567
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:42,990
they cooperate
in times of national emergency.

568
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:44,720
You need to get some sleep.

569
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:47,590
You know that the first
ballistics diagram got here

570
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,530
22 minutes after the shooting.

571
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:50,650
We're good at our jobs.

572
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,230
12 minutes after the shooting,
they were still scrambling choppers.

573
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:54,460
The scene was locked down.

574
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:59,070
How did they get a reverse azimuth
10 minutes after that?

575
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:00,270
I mean, we work
for the federal government.

576
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:01,710
We're not that good at our jobs.

577
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:04,170
- You want to see something?
- Probably not.

578
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,640
I downloaded this.

579
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:06,870
This is a full-scale printout

580
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:09,970
of a target Swagger shot
two years ago at 1,000 yards.

581
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:13,350
I punched in the holes myself.
It was at a competition.

582
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:18,190
I read an article. It said Swagger shot
a silver dollar at a grand.

583
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:19,490
Five shots,

584
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:21,060
at 1,000 yards,

585
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,560
an inch-and-a-half spread.
An inch and a half!

586
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:27,420
It was the capital of the United States...

587
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:31,060
That's the flag behind the President.
It's barely waving.

588
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:32,600
This is the wind speed and direction

589
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:33,970
according to the
National Weather Service

590
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:36,370
at the time of the shot. I did the math.

591
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,110
Now, how does a man who can do that

592
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:43,180
miss by two-and-a-half feet
at 2,000 yards?

593
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:44,980
I don't get it.

594
00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:47,920
You've had a long night.
Let it go and get some sleep.

595
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:50,150
You know, I saw Timmons interviewed.

596
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:52,490
He said he was walking foot patrol,

597
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:55,190
saw a rifle barrel
sticking out of a window,

598
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:58,130
went upstairs to investigate,
and shot Swagger.

599
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:00,130
No sniper sticks his rifle
out of a window.

600
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:03,000
They shoot from cover,
back in the room.

601
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:05,300
It doesn't make any sense.

602
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:09,200
- I'm gonna talk to Timmons.
- No, you're not.

603
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:11,400
Why? 'Cause they're gonna fire me
if I do?

604
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:15,010
Timmons was killed by a mugger
in an alley last night.

605
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,180
In a conspiracy,
all loose ends are trimmed.

606
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,460
Jack Ruby shoots Oswald?

607
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:25,780
Bad things happen to good people.

608
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:26,920
Yeah, not that quick, they don't.

609
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:35,370
Well, I stopped the bleeding
temporarily.

610
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,530
But it'll cut loose again.

611
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,940
I held off the worst of the infection,
but you're gonna have to open it up,

612
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,840
cut out and scrub away
anything that's dead,

613
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:47,810
working your way out,
sewing it together

614
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,710
and you got to try to make sure
you don't re-infect it.

615
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:54,590
You ready for this?

616
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:59,620
I'm going to do all those Whip-It! 's
and pass out.

617
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,130
Good luck, okay?

618
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:21,510
I need you to plan
a presidential assassination.

619
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:23,040
That our guy in the collar?

620
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:24,370
Whose president?

621
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:25,880
I didn't say "execute".

622
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,880
He's getting a medal. Know it?

623
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:31,210
The Archbishop of Ethiopia.

624
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:37,110
You need to find the shooter.

625
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:41,430
No.

626
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:37,400
Two-and-a-half days, shot twice,
no sign?

627
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:38,910
Find me something.

628
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:41,170
Maybe he crawled into a hole and died.

629
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,040
He's not dead.

630
00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:47,290
Tear apart his life.

631
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:48,720
Again.

632
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:54,990
Go okay?

633
00:56:00,330 --> 00:56:01,700
I've been hallucinating.

634
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:06,640
Something I need to tell you.

635
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,710
Ralphie's dead.

636
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:13,040
Who's Ralphie?

637
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:15,610
Well, they said you shot your dog

638
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,620
'cause you knew
you werert coming back.

639
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,190
They said that, huh?

640
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:25,020
Name was Sam.

641
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:28,590
He was a good dog.
I raised him from a pup.

642
00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:33,860
You okay?

643
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:36,800
No.

644
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:39,670
What are you gonna do?

645
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:42,800
I'll get better.

646
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:47,170
Then I'm going to burn
their playhouse down.

647
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:24,140
Can I help you?

648
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:54,270
Hold still.

649
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:07,760
I been meaning to ask you.

650
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,160
You have a boyfriend?

651
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,220
Why?

652
00:58:14,430 --> 00:58:17,030
Am I still supposed to be
the grieving widow?

653
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:18,800
It's been three years.

654
00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:19,870
No.

655
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:21,870
Just wonder if I'm gonna have
to shoot somebody

656
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:25,180
walks through that door without knocking,
wondering where you've been.

657
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:29,040
Well, no.

658
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:31,380
Nothing steady. No boyfriend.

659
00:58:56,010 --> 00:58:57,300
Not bad.

660
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:00,240
A little stiff, but...

661
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:03,010
Hey.

662
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:06,940
You know, you would've made
one hell of a nurse.

663
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:10,050
That was really brave, what you did.

664
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:11,580
You saved my life.

665
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:18,290
I'm better. I better get to it.

666
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,730
They're never gonna stop chasing you.

667
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:22,930
Never.

668
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,370
They're never gonna stop looking.

669
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:31,510
In the meantime,
they need someone else to find.

670
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:33,100
I'm going to give them him.

671
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:34,680
Excuse me?

672
00:59:35,850 --> 00:59:38,940
May be a way to get two birds
with that stone, too.

673
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,330
- Swagger?
- Hey.

674
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:01,870
The gun Donnie learned to hunt with
when he was a kid.

675
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:07,050
It ain't much, but it shoots true.

676
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:09,580
I cleaned and oiled it
before I put it away.

677
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:10,740
You sure?

678
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:12,950
Yeah.

679
01:00:17,290 --> 01:00:18,660
Why'd you go?

680
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:21,190
When they came to see you.

681
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,760
They know which buttons to press.

682
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,660
I'm still enough of a sucker,
you press that patriot button,

683
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:32,360
I'll sit up in my chair and say,
"Which way you want me to go, boss?"

684
01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:36,100
I mean, I ain't real proud of it,
but I ain't ashamed, either.

685
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:38,840
You know, I got a plan,

686
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,540
but I think I'm going to need your help.

687
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,650
Okay. I'll do it.

688
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,680
I haven't even told you what it is yet.

689
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:49,380
I know.

690
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:58,360
Look.

691
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:00,670
It was my fault.

692
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:04,440
What?

693
01:01:08,010 --> 01:01:10,170
You know, with Donnie.
I should never have...

694
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:18,240
What?

695
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:25,050
Don't you dare.

696
01:01:27,090 --> 01:01:30,150
Don't you try and take that
away from him.

697
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,930
He knew exactly what he was doing
when he enlisted.

698
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:39,000
He knew exactly what he was doing
when he enrolled in scout sniper training.

699
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:42,680
He loved what he did.

700
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:44,740
No one made him do it.

701
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:49,310
That ain't yours to carry.

702
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:53,850
You're right.

703
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:56,890
I'm sorry I tried.

704
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:24,270
It's okay.

705
01:02:30,290 --> 01:02:32,550
I need you to meet with this FBI agent.

706
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:35,420
Use him to flush Johnson
out of his hiding place.

707
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:39,520
Give him the vehicle ID number.
He'll do what he's trained to do.

708
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:42,100
You get in and get out.
Don't get caught.

709
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,990
You get caught, I get caught.

710
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:45,660
You know what that is?

711
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,170
Says he didn't shoot no one,
but I don't know.

712
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:51,570
Well, he's been staying with me.

713
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:53,730
Who's been staying with you?
Bob Lee Swagger?

714
01:03:02,450 --> 01:03:06,440
The plates are probably fake.
Pretty sure the other number's real.

715
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,150
- And what is this?
- A VIN number.

716
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:11,490
Seems no one goes through
the trouble to change them anymore.

717
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:15,630
And you're going to sit real still
until I'm long gone.

718
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:48,460
See the guy in the Eagles jacket?

719
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,060
Excuse me, sir.
Can I see some ID, please?

720
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:25,630
Sir, I'm going to need you
to take off your hat

721
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:26,890
and show me some ID.

722
01:04:31,010 --> 01:04:32,600
I'm not gonna ask you again.

723
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:35,770
Take your hat off, asshole!

724
01:04:44,890 --> 01:04:47,720
Get on the ground!
Get your ass on the ground!

725
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:22,280
Hey, how's it going?

726
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:25,290
Hey, John.

727
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,010
- Hey, Ed?
- Yeah.

728
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:52,050
You got that Stevens file
we wanted back?

729
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:57,690
How badly do you want to know?
Because this will get you fired.

730
01:05:58,030 --> 01:06:03,730
Well, I have to go before
the Office of Professional Responsibility

731
01:06:03,830 --> 01:06:05,820
in 45 minutes for a review.

732
01:06:05,930 --> 01:06:08,960
I'm gonna get fired anyway.
I'm done worrying about that.

733
01:06:10,170 --> 01:06:12,140
What do you think?

734
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:15,280
I think that CNN got the tapes
before we did,

735
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:17,710
already edited together
to show the angles.

736
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:18,910
Who delivered them?

737
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:22,420
An unnamed agency
who will never confirm or deny.

738
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,490
They denied, which is a...

739
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:30,250
Which is a confirmation of sorts.

740
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:32,190
Of what?

741
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:35,820
That you are asking questions
way outside your pay grade.

742
01:06:35,930 --> 01:06:37,060
Oh, come on, just tell me.

743
01:06:37,170 --> 01:06:38,660
You don't want to be here
for that review.

744
01:06:38,770 --> 01:06:42,330
They don't have to stop at firing you.
They can charge you and hold you.

745
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:54,910
The ASAC's job
comes with Delta clearance.

746
01:06:57,950 --> 01:06:59,250
- Thank you.
- Go.

747
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:08,420
This is a copy of a chat room transcript.

748
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:11,620
These guys talk about everything.
I didn't give it much thought at the time.

749
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:14,200
We just traced it to a donut shop
with free WiFi.

750
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:19,970
But this,this is a Delta-level clearance request out of
the FBI field office in Philadelphia seven minutes ago.

751
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,670
Funny thing,
Google Maps puts the donut shop

752
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:25,300
only three blocks away
from the field office.

753
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:28,470
There's only one guy who met
with Swagger before he disappeared.

754
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:29,780
He lives in Philly.

755
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:31,450
And he works for the FBI.

756
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,090
Nicholas Memphis.

757
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:37,980
...really strange company.
Contracts with a lot of the Fortune 500.

758
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:40,930
Offices in Virginia, Delaware,
registered in Panama.

759
01:07:41,030 --> 01:07:42,830
They own a boat
that's flagged out of Libya.

760
01:07:42,930 --> 01:07:43,920
They're definitely not government,

761
01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:46,760
but they have high ex-military contacts
like you wouldn't believe.

762
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:48,060
These are contractors.

763
01:07:48,170 --> 01:07:50,660
I can't tell
what this company does, but...

764
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:53,530
Hey.

765
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:54,610
Hey, hey, hey!

766
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:00,780
Memphis?

767
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:01,850
Memphis!

768
01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:10,960
For a man who didn't know much,

769
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:14,360
you sure took a long,
painful time to tell it.

770
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:16,060
Get him some water.

771
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:26,270
Good.

772
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:38,050
Got to pee yet?

773
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:40,020
Got to flush them drugs
out of your system.

774
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:42,420
Look awful suspicious
if you were to go and shoot yourself

775
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,790
pumped full of the same shit
the agency uses.

776
01:08:44,890 --> 01:08:46,830
I'm not going to shoot myself.

777
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:48,760
Sure you will.

778
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,230
Take him out. Get him ready.

779
01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:52,300
No!

780
01:08:58,040 --> 01:08:59,170
That's my gun.

781
01:08:59,270 --> 01:09:00,300
Yeah.

782
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:03,280
You wrote a real touching
suicide note, too.

783
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:05,710
All overwrought with guilt
about your mistakes.

784
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:14,310
Quit your struggling.

785
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:21,730
This thing works.
It's not the first time we've used it.

786
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:27,930
Russo. Russo!

787
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:29,660
Davis, get out here!

788
01:09:34,510 --> 01:09:36,640
What is the goddamn hold-up?

789
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:17,450
Don't kill me, please!
Don't kill me! I believe you!

790
01:10:17,550 --> 01:10:18,640
Kill you?

791
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:21,380
Had enough chances.
I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.

792
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:25,420
What kind of asshole'd
think up a thing like this?

793
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:36,900
Not bad with a poodle shooter
and a makeshift silencer, huh?

794
01:10:38,210 --> 01:10:40,330
Help me toss these boys in the water?

795
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,740
You set me up and you used me as bait!

796
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:45,680
You think? Flushed them out, didn't it?

797
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:46,810
I was kind of hoping to keep one alive,

798
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:49,010
but they were
kind of determined to kill you.

799
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,350
You can hire a good lawyer,
and I'll call the Bureau.

800
01:10:51,450 --> 01:10:53,390
They can work out some kind of deal.

801
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:57,220
This is explainable. You can prove
that you didn't shoot the Archbishop.

802
01:10:57,330 --> 01:10:58,450
I don't think you understand.

803
01:10:58,560 --> 01:10:59,750
These boys killed my dog.

804
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:05,600
Hey, this is the 21st century.
You can't go to war with these people.

805
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:07,260
In the end, the law is all...

806
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:10,070
In the end,
the law'll never catch and hold them.

807
01:11:10,170 --> 01:11:11,470
In a year or two,
they'll be back in business.

808
01:11:11,570 --> 01:11:14,100
New names, new messenger boys,
same old story.

809
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:15,500
And I'll be dead.

810
01:11:15,610 --> 01:11:17,540
It's gonna be
some hard, hairy work, Pork.

811
01:11:17,650 --> 01:11:19,740
There's gonna be more shooting,
and more people are gonna die.

812
01:11:19,850 --> 01:11:23,080
Now, I didn't start it, but be sure as hell
I mean to see it through.

813
01:11:23,190 --> 01:11:25,680
So you get it straight. You in or you out?

814
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,320
You know, I missed a meeting today

815
01:11:30,430 --> 01:11:33,880
where I was going to get fired
for unprofessional conduct

816
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,990
because I was kidnapped by people
that don't exist.

817
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,040
I'll take his legs.

818
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:44,800
It's a good call, Pork.

819
01:11:45,370 --> 01:11:48,170
You're trying to tell me
a rookie FBI agent

820
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:50,070
overpowered and killed
the three of them?

821
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:51,150
No.

822
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:55,780
They were shot from a distance
of about 200 yards.

823
01:11:57,650 --> 01:11:58,910
With a.22.

824
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:03,120
- Swagger's alive.
- Yes.

825
01:12:03,230 --> 01:12:06,480
And that young kid,FBI Agent

826
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,160
Nick Memphis,

827
01:12:10,270 --> 01:12:14,070
who managed to pry out
a Delta-level clearance,

828
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:17,900
hasn't come back to the office
and is out there with him.

829
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,040
What?

830
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:23,300
I just went over
Swagger's financials again.

831
01:12:23,780 --> 01:12:27,440
Once a year, he sent flowers
to someone with his Visa card.

832
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,880
I cracked the FTD database,
got an address.

833
01:12:30,150 --> 01:12:33,320
Donnie Fenrs widow.
Anniversary of his death.

834
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:34,620
She went back to using
her maiden name,

835
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,950
which is why we missed it the first time.

836
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:39,890
She's maybe the only person
in the entire world

837
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,050
that would believe anything
that Swagger had to say.

838
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:45,570
Look. Keene City, Kentucky.

839
01:12:45,670 --> 01:12:47,330
It's just within driving range.

840
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:51,000
- What are you waiting for? Take the jet.
- All right.

841
01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:00,480
We've given Swagger a new war,

842
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:02,380
he's found a new spotter.

843
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:05,380
This is about to get worse.

844
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,110
I think we're here.

845
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:38,480
Hey. Swagger.

846
01:13:42,890 --> 01:13:44,320
I think we're here.

847
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:49,560
Welcome to Tennessee.

848
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:51,790
Patron state of shooting stuff.

849
01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:55,500
Hey, who is this guy?

850
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:59,130
This guy was the greatest gunsmith
east of the Mississippi. He's a legend.

851
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:01,640
He knows more about guns  and the people 
who shoot them than Smith & Wesson.

852
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:05,070
Don't really matter anymore. He knew
we were coming the last three miles.

853
01:14:05,180 --> 01:14:06,340
- You mind your manners.
- All right.

854
01:14:06,450 --> 01:14:10,040
You boys come a long way.
What you looking for?

855
01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:11,440
Wisdom.

856
01:14:13,490 --> 01:14:15,120
You come to the wrong place.

857
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:16,490
Maybe.

858
01:14:16,590 --> 01:14:18,180
Say a man wanted to fire a bullet
from one rifle

859
01:14:18,290 --> 01:14:19,950
and have it match exactly to another.

860
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:21,430
Could that be done?

861
01:14:21,530 --> 01:14:22,550
Take a seat.

862
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:24,660
Have a chair, son.

863
01:14:28,940 --> 01:14:32,900
If you could get a bullet that had been
shot clean through the first rifle,

864
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:34,500
could make the grooves match.

865
01:14:34,610 --> 01:14:36,940
Kind of thing ain't been done
in a long time, though.

866
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:38,570
The bullet that was taken
out of the Archbishop

867
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:40,240
was completely mangled on impact.

868
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:42,580
FBI match was metallurgical.

869
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:43,840
Thank you, Mother.

870
01:14:43,950 --> 01:14:46,350
Yeah, but you couldn't guarantee that
going in, so they had to be sure.

871
01:14:46,450 --> 01:14:48,950
And I still can't figure out
how they could be.

872
01:14:51,890 --> 01:14:53,450
- Good coffee?
- Yep.

873
01:14:55,460 --> 01:14:58,630
Look on your left, there.
Second shelf down.

874
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:01,730
Red leather spine.

875
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:04,800
Written by a guy named Schofeld.

876
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:09,880
Put it there 15 years ago.
Don't figure it's moved since then.

877
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:31,790
Yeah. Paper patching.

878
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:35,060
State of the art. 1870s Africa.

879
01:15:35,170 --> 01:15:36,400
Paper-wrapped bullet.

880
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:39,030
No metal on metal
going down the barrel.

881
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:42,170
Grooves would match.
Paper unwinds at the muzzle.

882
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:44,300
Leaves no traces when it hits.

883
01:15:44,410 --> 01:15:48,040
Interesting question, though.
Hope I satisfied you.

884
01:15:48,150 --> 01:15:49,450
I got another one.

885
01:15:50,190 --> 01:15:51,210
I thought you might.

886
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:54,310
Suppose I was looking for a man
to make a 2,200-yard cold-bore shot.

887
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:56,120
Who's alive that could do that?

888
01:15:56,690 --> 01:16:00,820
Seems I heard about a shot like that
being made not too long ago.

889
01:16:00,930 --> 01:16:04,060
Said the guy's name
was Bob Lee Swagger.

890
01:16:04,170 --> 01:16:06,390
Never met the man,
so I wouldn't know him.

891
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:07,970
Yeah, they said that, all right.

892
01:16:08,070 --> 01:16:11,770
They also said
that artificial sweeteners were safe,

893
01:16:12,770 --> 01:16:15,300
and WMDs were in Iraq,

894
01:16:14,450 --> 01:16:17,110
and Anna Nicole married for love!

895
01:16:20,050 --> 01:16:21,910
Would've been
a bad job to take, though.

896
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:23,080
How come?

897
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:25,740
Whoever took that shot's
probably dead now.

898
01:16:25,850 --> 01:16:27,750
That's how a conspiracy works.

899
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:30,510
Them boys on the grassy knoll,
they were dead within three hours.

900
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:34,550
<font size=22
Buried in the damn desert.
Unmarked graves out past Terlingua.

901
01:16:35,630 --> 01:16:37,060
And you know this for a fact?

902
01:16:37,170 --> 01:16:38,960
Still got the shovel.

903
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:42,970
Sake of argument,
somebody other than him?

904
01:16:43,070 --> 01:16:44,600
There was a guy in Russia.

905
01:16:44,710 --> 01:16:46,470
They locked his ass up.

906
01:16:47,180 --> 01:16:49,840
Another one in France.
I know he's dead.

907
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:52,610
There was one guy,

908
01:16:52,710 --> 01:16:54,980
but he don't shoot no more.

909
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:58,110
A brutal son of a bitch.

910
01:16:58,220 --> 01:17:01,350
Most boys shoot to kill.
He'd shoot to wound,

911
01:17:02,090 --> 01:17:03,790
wait till his friends come to help,

912
01:17:04,190 --> 01:17:05,350
kill them too.

913
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:07,620
Turned one target into four.

914
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:12,130
Men, women, children.
Killed them by the hundreds.

915
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:14,500
The other side wanted him. Bad.

916
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:19,900
Finally narrowed his hide down
to an abandoned six-story building.

917
01:17:21,110 --> 01:17:23,040
They quit the subtle tactics.

918
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:25,770
They called in an artillery strike.

919
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:27,780
Leveled a square block.

920
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:30,040
Brought the building down on his ass.

921
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:32,590
Some say he crawled out of there.

922
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:34,420
Some say he died.

923
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:36,460
Never heard from him no more.

924
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:38,720
Fuck me.

925
01:17:38,830 --> 01:17:39,820
What?

926
01:17:39,930 --> 01:17:41,360
I met the son of a bitch.

927
01:17:45,830 --> 01:17:48,860
Yeah. The world ain't what it seems,
is it, Gunnie?

928
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:50,960
No, sir.

929
01:17:51,070 --> 01:17:52,660
You keep that in mind.

930
01:17:52,770 --> 01:17:54,540
The moment you think you got it figured,

931
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:55,680
you're wrong.

932
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:00,810
He got a name?

933
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:07,750
Hey, it's me, Nick.

934
01:18:07,860 --> 01:18:10,790
Do you have any idea
how much trouble you're in?

935
01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:13,520
- Yeah.
- Are you okay? Nick, where are you?

936
01:18:13,630 --> 01:18:14,860
It's better I don't tell you.

937
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:18,060
Look, do you have a pen?

938
01:18:18,170 --> 01:18:20,630
I need you to find someone.
Mikhaylo Sczerbiak.

939
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:21,700
- Yeah.
- You got it?

940
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:22,790
I got it.

941
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:24,770
Man, this is hard to spell.

942
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:34,140
Swagger is going to go
with what he knows.

943
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:36,510
He'll try to track the shooter.

944
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:38,140
He won't get far that way.

945
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:39,740
Yes, he will.

946
01:18:39,850 --> 01:18:41,950
- How's that?
- We're going to help him.

947
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:45,120
Sometimes to catch a wolf,
you need to tie the bait to a tree.

948
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:53,960
And what happens to the bait?

949
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:56,870
Hard to say.

950
01:18:57,870 --> 01:19:00,530
But that's the nature of being the bait.

951
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:15,950
- Hey, it's Nick. Did you find him?
- He's in Virginia.

952
01:19:17,030 --> 01:19:19,120
An end we thought was tied up

953
01:19:19,330 --> 01:19:20,420
came untied.

954
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:23,020
Meaning, Colonel?

955
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:24,960
Swagger is still alive.

956
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:29,770
Oh, my.

957
01:19:30,410 --> 01:19:35,040
I need to land a transport plane
without a customs check.

958
01:19:36,710 --> 01:19:40,310
I'm certain I don't want to know,
but what's on the plane?

959
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:43,880
Crew we used in Ethiopia.

960
01:19:43,990 --> 01:19:46,980
Twenty-four good, hard men.

961
01:19:47,090 --> 01:19:49,250
Weapons and gear.

962
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:50,880
Only 24?

963
01:19:52,330 --> 01:19:53,730
Do kill him.

964
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:57,400
No loose ends this time.

965
01:19:58,300 --> 01:19:59,700
Night, Colonel.

966
01:20:01,370 --> 01:20:02,360
Good night, Senator.

967
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:22,280
Hello?

968
01:20:24,490 --> 01:20:25,890
Someone there?

969
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:03,290
Now look.

970
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,800
Look what you've done now.

971
01:21:09,070 --> 01:21:10,500
Give me that.

972
01:21:10,610 --> 01:21:13,600
I don't want you to hurt yourself. Okay?

973
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:23,950
Where's your boyfriend?

974
01:21:26,190 --> 01:21:27,780
What if it's a trap?

975
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:29,590
Oh, it's a trap.

976
01:21:29,690 --> 01:21:32,020
Guaranteed. Every time.

977
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:35,590
Question is, for whom?

978
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:38,930
- You got your list, right?
- Yep.

979
01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:41,260
All right, you make sure you stick to it.

980
01:22:09,330 --> 01:22:10,300
Let's go.

981
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:17,860
Okay, so what are these for again?

982
01:22:18,570 --> 01:22:20,270
Tear gas is going to be on my remote.

983
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:21,930
Right.

984
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:26,280
Napalm on the first floor.
Pipe bombs on the rest of them.

985
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:30,410
Gotta be very careful with these.
It's got a 15-foot kill radius.

986
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:32,680
So what exactly
are we getting ready for?

987
01:22:32,790 --> 01:22:34,220
For as much as we can be.

988
01:22:47,370 --> 01:22:49,600
All right, you got
four enemy combatants.

989
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:51,430
Take them one by one.

990
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:53,470
Keep shooting.
Don't let anything distract you.

991
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,140
Fuck!

992
01:23:05,450 --> 01:23:07,890
Didrt I say
don't let anything distract you?

993
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:10,510
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.
Let's see it.

994
01:23:26,610 --> 01:23:28,130
No. No.

995
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:30,510
It's just you and me, baby.

996
01:23:30,610 --> 01:23:31,670
No!

997
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:36,220
You got three guards.

998
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:38,550
One at your 2:00,

999
01:23:39,950 --> 01:23:41,050
12:00

1000
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:43,550
and 10:00.

1001
01:23:52,170 --> 01:23:53,190
Danger close. 2:00,

1002
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:54,270
fifty yards.

1003
01:24:57,900 --> 01:24:58,960
You got one right on you.

1004
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:00,370
20 yards and closing.

1005
01:25:51,090 --> 01:25:52,480
Go check the perimeter.

1006
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:54,440
And tell the others to stay alert.

1007
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,280
I'm on it. Right away, sir.

1008
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:31,950
Swagger, you got one above you
on the roof.

1009
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:51,980
You killed all three?

1010
01:26:52,910 --> 01:26:54,250
There were four.

1011
01:26:55,180 --> 01:26:58,640
I want Johnsors real name.
I want to know who he works for.

1012
01:26:58,750 --> 01:27:00,620
I want to know why it was won'th
going through that much effort

1013
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:02,150
to kill the Archbishop.

1014
01:27:03,090 --> 01:27:04,580
Arert you the one that shot him?

1015
01:27:04,690 --> 01:27:06,750
And if I don't know any of those things?

1016
01:27:06,860 --> 01:27:07,950
Then you're of no won'th to me

1017
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:10,220
and I might as well shoot you now
and leave.

1018
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:16,840
Johnsors had a lot of names.

1019
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:20,700
Don't know one's any more real
than the next.

1020
01:27:20,810 --> 01:27:22,540
Knowing would only be dangerous.

1021
01:27:24,210 --> 01:27:25,740
He's ex-army.

1022
01:27:25,850 --> 01:27:28,280
Pretty sure he was a full-bird colonel.

1023
01:27:31,590 --> 01:27:32,680
Go on.

1024
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:37,290
They came for me,
like they came for you.

1025
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:40,860
Recruitment for a single job.

1026
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:44,000
They like the wounded.

1027
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:46,760
Easier to use

1028
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:49,770
and then throw away
when you are done.

1029
01:27:51,170 --> 01:27:53,160
Timmons, you, me...

1030
01:27:55,810 --> 01:28:00,750
Once you've been a wolf, it's hard
to be staked down like a goat.

1031
01:28:01,850 --> 01:28:06,620
This is just one dead man
talking to another.

1032
01:28:07,690 --> 01:28:09,020
And the Archbishop?

1033
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:14,490
You want to take all suspicions away
when you shoot someone,

1034
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:17,160
wait till he's standing
next to the President.

1035
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:20,030
What was he going to say?

1036
01:28:21,070 --> 01:28:22,400
The truth.

1037
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:26,060
That nothing, no matter how horrible,

1038
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:29,670
ever really happens
without the approval of the government.

1039
01:28:29,780 --> 01:28:31,770
Over there, and here.

1040
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:35,680
The problem isn't the doing.

1041
01:28:37,180 --> 01:28:39,280
It's the people in power having to admit

1042
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:40,850
that they knew.

1043
01:28:42,620 --> 01:28:45,420
The prisoners are tortured
at Abu Ghraib,

1044
01:28:45,530 --> 01:28:47,690
and only the underlings go to jail.

1045
01:28:48,430 --> 01:28:50,020
Their bosses knew.

1046
01:28:50,130 --> 01:28:52,260
We know their bosses knew.

1047
01:28:52,370 --> 01:28:53,590
But you don't say it.

1048
01:28:53,700 --> 01:28:55,430
What exactly happened in Africa?

1049
01:28:55,540 --> 01:28:58,030
Somehow the villagers didn't think

1050
01:28:58,270 --> 01:29:00,170
that an oil pipeline

1051
01:29:00,780 --> 01:29:03,540
was a good enough reason
to move their village

1052
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:07,080
to a place
where the spirit gods didn't exist.

1053
01:29:07,180 --> 01:29:08,150
Drink?

1054
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:09,310
So they asked them all nicely to move

1055
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:10,780
and when they didn't,
they just killed them all?

1056
01:29:10,890 --> 01:29:11,850
No.

1057
01:29:12,090 --> 01:29:13,310
They didn't ask.

1058
01:29:13,690 --> 01:29:15,050
They just killed them.

1059
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:16,120
AII.

1060
01:29:16,390 --> 01:29:19,360
So the next village
won't need to be asked.

1061
01:29:19,460 --> 01:29:20,790
They'll just go.

1062
01:29:32,610 --> 01:29:36,840
There is a mass grave with 400 bodies,

1063
01:29:36,940 --> 01:29:40,640
men, women, children,

1064
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:45,380
under the oil pumping station
10 kilometers over the Eritrean border.

1065
01:29:47,150 --> 01:29:48,590
You should know.

1066
01:29:48,690 --> 01:29:52,720
You covered the retreat
of the contractors who did the job.

1067
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:56,860
Of course, you werert supposed
to survive that, either.

1068
01:30:06,010 --> 01:30:07,170
Who runs Johnson?

1069
01:30:07,270 --> 01:30:09,670
A senator. From Montana, I think.

1070
01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:12,870
You don't get it.

1071
01:30:13,310 --> 01:30:15,410
There is no head to cut off.

1072
01:30:16,580 --> 01:30:18,380
It's a conglomerate.

1073
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:21,780
If one of them betrays the principles

1074
01:30:23,290 --> 01:30:25,520
of the accrual of money and power,

1075
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:28,320
the others betray him.

1076
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:35,530
What it is
is human weakness.

1077
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:39,810
You can't kill that with a gun.

1078
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:48,680
Swagger.

1079
01:30:48,780 --> 01:30:49,770
Swagger.

1080
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:52,680
You got to get out of there.
They're everywhere.

1081
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:56,580
Had to keep you till they got here.

1082
01:30:58,060 --> 01:31:01,360
Lying wasrt going to hold you.

1083
01:31:02,130 --> 01:31:03,690
You would have known.

1084
01:31:08,670 --> 01:31:11,970
By the way, they've got your woman.

1085
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:16,100
Swagger.

1086
01:31:16,210 --> 01:31:19,670
They're 20 yards and closing.
You got to get out of there.

1087
01:31:21,450 --> 01:31:23,350
- Bug out. Go to hide two.
- Roger that.

1088
01:31:55,420 --> 01:31:57,080
Swagger, I'm in position two.

1089
01:31:57,990 --> 01:31:59,110
You got to get out of there.

1090
01:31:59,220 --> 01:32:00,690
- They're all over the place.
- Hey!

1091
01:32:01,290 --> 01:32:02,690
Calm down.

1092
01:32:02,790 --> 01:32:05,280
Blow the pipe bombs outside on my call,
okay? You got it?

1093
01:32:05,590 --> 01:32:07,390
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I got it.

1094
01:32:14,970 --> 01:32:15,940
Listen very carefully.

1095
01:32:16,100 --> 01:32:17,730
On my one, you blow the pipe bombs,

1096
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:18,810
then the gas.

1097
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,600
Three, two, one...

1098
01:32:51,510 --> 01:32:52,630
Hit it. Hit the napalm.

1099
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:48,750
Swagger!

1100
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,300
You got it.

1101
01:34:08,650 --> 01:34:09,810
Swagger!

1102
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:13,780
Swagger!

1103
01:34:14,490 --> 01:34:15,820
Swagger!

1104
01:34:22,430 --> 01:34:24,290
You got to bug out
on my go behind that barn.

1105
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:25,370
Okay.

1106
01:34:25,470 --> 01:34:26,520
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1107
01:34:26,630 --> 01:34:27,660
Go!

1108
01:34:31,140 --> 01:34:32,110
Come on!

1109
01:35:00,530 --> 01:35:01,800
You got to gun it to that tree line.

1110
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:03,070
What?

1111
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:05,100
You got five shots left.
Gotta draw that bird out.

1112
01:35:05,210 --> 01:35:06,540
Okay. Okay.

1113
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:08,510
- On my cover, all right?
- Okay.

1114
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:11,270
All right, go!

1115
01:35:24,690 --> 01:35:26,180
Pull up! Pull up!

1116
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:43,230
Time to go!

1117
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:02,060
Let me take a look.

1118
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:03,460
Not right now.

1119
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:05,360
Morning, beautiful.

1120
01:36:05,470 --> 01:36:07,700
- See this weird shootout in Virginia?
- Sir...

1121
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:12,140
Shells everywhere, helicopter remnants,
blood. No bodies, though, right?

1122
01:36:12,240 --> 01:36:15,870
And they get fingerprints
off the can'tridge cases.

1123
01:36:15,980 --> 01:36:19,210
First set positively IDed
as Bob Lee Swagger.

1124
01:36:21,010 --> 01:36:26,320
Second set belongs to Special Agent 
Nick Memphis of the FBI.

1125
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:28,140
What? That's gotta be wrong.

1126
01:36:31,490 --> 01:36:34,950
Now, the only reasonable question
to ask after that is,

1127
01:36:37,330 --> 01:36:38,560
what the fuck is going on?

1128
01:36:44,570 --> 01:36:45,900
Great shot!

1129
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:51,970
- All yours, Dan!
- Good shooting!

1130
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:55,340
I'm beginning to think that you were
the wrong man for the job.

1131
01:36:56,950 --> 01:36:58,420
Think what you want.

1132
01:37:00,950 --> 01:37:04,910
It appears we misjudged
the gunnery sergeant.

1133
01:37:06,730 --> 01:37:08,720
There's always a confused soul

1134
01:37:08,830 --> 01:37:11,420
that thinks that one man
can make a difference.

1135
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:15,730
And you have to kill him
to convince him otherwise.

1136
01:37:18,070 --> 01:37:20,040
That's the hassle with democracy.

1137
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:21,570
Pull!

1138
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:37,860
...fire under their asses,
you understand me?

1139
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:39,520
We need those results now.

1140
01:37:39,630 --> 01:37:41,960
Anna, you guys, you take the team...
Anna! ...to the roadhouse.

1141
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:44,660
Okay, I don't care who it is right now.
I don't give...

1142
01:37:44,770 --> 01:37:47,930
Guys! We got Memphis on the line.

1143
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:49,260
Start a trace.

1144
01:37:50,170 --> 01:37:51,760
Got it. I'm on it.

1145
01:37:51,870 --> 01:37:54,100
Nick. Hey, it's Howard here.
How are you?

1146
01:37:54,370 --> 01:37:57,500
Things have gotten a little complicated.
I got Bob Lee Swagger in custody.

1147
01:37:58,610 --> 01:38:00,550
Yeah, turns out he's not dead, Howard.

1148
01:38:00,650 --> 01:38:03,240
Yeah, I know. Word of that possibility
had begun to reach us.

1149
01:38:03,980 --> 01:38:05,210
Got him.

1150
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:06,950
Were you in a gunfight
in Virginia last night?

1151
01:38:07,050 --> 01:38:09,850
Like I said,
things have gotten a little complicated.

1152
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:14,330
Well, obviously the best thing for you
would be to bring him in, right?

1153
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:16,330
Oh, no. I can't do that.

1154
01:38:16,430 --> 01:38:17,420
Why?

1155
01:38:17,530 --> 01:38:19,520
It's gotten too deep.
It's not clear who can be trusted.

1156
01:38:20,430 --> 01:38:22,800
- But we're the FBI, son.
- Yeah, I know.

1157
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:24,330
Yeah, I'll keep in touch.

1158
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:25,730
Oh, Nick, wait...

1159
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:27,740
Son of a bitch.

1160
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:28,870
- Did we get that?
- Got him.

1161
01:38:28,980 --> 01:38:30,070
- Let's move.
- They're on an interstate

1162
01:38:30,180 --> 01:38:32,410
- outside Bozeman, Montana.
- Let's move!

1163
01:38:38,190 --> 01:38:39,150
This is Swagger.

1164
01:38:39,250 --> 01:38:40,950
- Colonel Johnson here.
- Figured you'd be listening.

1165
01:38:41,050 --> 01:38:43,450
- It appears you have nowhere to go.
- Colonel?

1166
01:38:43,990 --> 01:38:44,960
If it is "Colonel"?

1167
01:38:45,390 --> 01:38:46,520
It is.

1168
01:38:48,030 --> 01:38:51,050
- I have something you want.
- Well, it seems so do I.

1169
01:38:54,130 --> 01:38:58,900
Over the Eritrean border,
there is a mass grave with 400 bodies.

1170
01:38:59,010 --> 01:39:01,700
Men, women, children.

1171
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:04,810
Tell you what, I'll give it to you
and we'll call it even.

1172
01:39:04,910 --> 01:39:06,380
I just want someone there I can trust.

1173
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:09,070
I'm amenable.
Who do you have in mind?

1174
01:39:08,290 --> 01:39:10,190
How about that guy from U2
with the glasses?

1175
01:39:10,290 --> 01:39:12,690
Friend of Nelson Mandela and all.
He seems trustwon'thy.

1176
01:39:12,790 --> 01:39:14,780
Bono? You want them to get Bono?

1177
01:39:15,790 --> 01:39:19,120
My colleague's questioning
my choice. Okay,

1178
01:39:19,230 --> 01:39:22,720
I see how that could be a tough
problem. You know, last minute and all.

1179
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:27,030
How about six-term senator
Charles Meachum from Montana?

1180
01:39:27,130 --> 01:39:29,970
Seems like a pretty good
second choice, don't you think?

1181
01:39:31,740 --> 01:39:33,000
I don't think so.

1182
01:39:33,110 --> 01:39:35,970
I'm gonna provide you
with two numbers, then we'll talk.

1183
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:38,700
Point 732. Point 648.

1184
01:39:39,250 --> 01:39:40,440
And what the hell is that?

1185
01:39:40,550 --> 01:39:43,710
Those are the last three digits, down to
a few meters of latitude and longitude,

1186
01:39:43,820 --> 01:39:45,810
of an oil pipeline pumping station
in Eritrea

1187
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:47,250
with 400 bodies underneath.

1188
01:39:47,950 --> 01:39:49,150
Where are we meeting?

1189
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:52,920
Somewhere I can see you,

1190
01:39:53,990 --> 01:39:56,760
coming from a goddamn long way off.

1191
01:41:05,270 --> 01:41:06,600
Where's your boy?

1192
01:41:20,980 --> 01:41:22,610
Well, I'm here.

1193
01:41:31,420 --> 01:41:32,450
He's here.

1194
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:33,860
Look, look, look.

1195
01:41:34,690 --> 01:41:36,720
There's your boy.
There's your boy, baby.

1196
01:41:45,410 --> 01:41:47,500
Come on, come on. Look, look. Look up.

1197
01:41:57,780 --> 01:41:59,080
Okay.

1198
01:42:42,630 --> 01:42:44,260
I think I broke a rib!

1199
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:47,090
Don't move!

1200
01:42:47,530 --> 01:42:48,970
Is there anybody else?

1201
01:42:49,570 --> 01:42:50,540
No.

1202
01:43:17,460 --> 01:43:20,090
He head-shoots me, spasm kills her!

1203
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:23,390
You got no shot!

1204
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:26,900
No shot, Swagger!
You hear that, Swagger?

1205
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:31,370
You got no shot!

1206
01:43:32,010 --> 01:43:34,810
What are you gonna do? Come on!

1207
01:43:43,790 --> 01:43:45,450
It's over for you, buddy!

1208
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:53,130
No shot! Okay, fuck him.

1209
01:44:07,150 --> 01:44:08,670
Not bad!

1210
01:44:08,780 --> 01:44:10,980
Pretty good! He went for the shot.

1211
01:44:13,420 --> 01:44:14,550
Christ.

1212
01:44:32,410 --> 01:44:33,500
How can we help you?

1213
01:44:33,610 --> 01:44:35,770
Guest at the motel last night
gave me $100

1214
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:37,670
to bring this by here at 3:00 p.m.

1215
01:44:41,550 --> 01:44:42,540
Let's move!

1216
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:12,430
You all right?

1217
01:45:13,250 --> 01:45:14,210
Yeah.

1218
01:45:24,590 --> 01:45:25,560
Search him.

1219
01:45:25,660 --> 01:45:27,220
I don't carry a weapon,

1220
01:45:30,230 --> 01:45:31,460
ordinarily.

1221
01:45:32,030 --> 01:45:34,160
I'm licensed to carry that in this state.

1222
01:45:42,180 --> 01:45:43,470
Pull the pilot.

1223
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:47,170
Put your weapon down! Put it down!

1224
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:48,440
Put your gun down!

1225
01:45:48,550 --> 01:45:49,670
Easy. Easy.

1226
01:46:00,130 --> 01:46:01,180
Sarah.

1227
01:46:02,230 --> 01:46:03,860
Give me the gun.

1228
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:06,330
It's okay. Give me the gun.

1229
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:16,870
You okay?

1230
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:19,640
Put them up. Keep them up.

1231
01:46:19,750 --> 01:46:21,300
Nice shooting, Gunnie.

1232
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:24,980
Yeah, you got what you came for.

1233
01:46:25,090 --> 01:46:27,350
I think it's time you owe us
your side of the bargain.

1234
01:46:27,450 --> 01:46:28,420
You do, huh?

1235
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:31,550
Yes, I do, son. I certainly do.

1236
01:46:32,230 --> 01:46:35,220
Why don't we think about all this
that has gone on

1237
01:46:35,330 --> 01:46:37,090
just as a preamble?

1238
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:39,060
You got any plans after this?

1239
01:46:39,730 --> 01:46:44,170
You have a rather unique skill set.
I'd be interested in offering you a job.

1240
01:46:44,270 --> 01:46:46,470
Work? For you?

1241
01:46:46,570 --> 01:46:50,340
It's not really as bad as it seems.
It's all gonna be done in any case.

1242
01:46:50,440 --> 01:46:54,000
You might as well be on the side
that gets you well paid for your efforts.

1243
01:46:54,110 --> 01:46:56,170
And what side are you on?

1244
01:46:56,280 --> 01:46:59,150
There are no sides.
There's no Sunnis and Shiites.

1245
01:46:59,250 --> 01:47:00,410
There's no Democrats and Republicans.

1246
01:47:00,520 --> 01:47:02,820
There's only haves and have-nots.

1247
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:05,910
What exactly does working for you
entail, Senator?

1248
01:47:06,330 --> 01:47:09,520
Raping and murdering innocent women
and children, you sick fuck?

1249
01:47:09,630 --> 01:47:11,460
You sanctioned the mass murder
of an entire village

1250
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:12,550
so a pipeline could go through.

1251
01:47:12,670 --> 01:47:14,260
One village!

1252
01:47:14,370 --> 01:47:16,390
And it brought stability to the region.

1253
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:19,670
Which means that no one
chops off their arms

1254
01:47:19,770 --> 01:47:23,270
because their grandmother's grandfather 
belonged to a different tribe.

1255
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:25,770
They like us down there, boy.

1256
01:47:32,820 --> 01:47:34,910
This is a country

1257
01:47:35,660 --> 01:47:37,850
where the Secretary of Defense

1258
01:47:40,030 --> 01:47:41,620
can go on TV

1259
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,120
and tell the American public,

1260
01:47:44,330 --> 01:47:47,960
oh, that "This is about freedom!
It's not about oil!"

1261
01:47:48,770 --> 01:47:50,700
And nobody questions him,

1262
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:53,670
because they don't want to hear
the answer because it's a lie!

1263
01:47:56,110 --> 01:48:00,340
There's only so many places
at the table, Gunnie.

1264
01:48:00,750 --> 01:48:02,410
Now are you on the inside,

1265
01:48:02,750 --> 01:48:04,050
or are you on the out?

1266
01:48:11,120 --> 01:48:12,460
It's the FBI!

1267
01:48:13,290 --> 01:48:14,890
It's gonna be okay. Hold this.

1268
01:48:17,630 --> 01:48:21,000
If one of them betrays
the principles of the accrual...

1269
01:48:21,100 --> 01:48:22,760
I don't think so, Senator.

1270
01:48:27,010 --> 01:48:28,940
- What are you doing?
- Saving our lives.

1271
01:48:29,380 --> 01:48:31,500
- That proved you were innocent!
- Nobody out here is innocent!

1272
01:48:31,610 --> 01:48:35,450
This stuff's plutonium.
Nobody can handle it without dying.

1273
01:48:35,550 --> 01:48:39,010
You hand it over to the authorities,
it's just gonna disappear, along with us!

1274
01:48:39,120 --> 01:48:42,110
Unless you want to get buried
in the hills outside Terlingua.

1275
01:48:42,220 --> 01:48:43,750
I'm out, old man!

1276
01:48:43,860 --> 01:48:46,650
I'm just a peckerwood who lives
in the hills with too many guns.

1277
01:48:46,760 --> 01:48:48,060
You happy?

1278
01:48:52,370 --> 01:48:54,130
Where do you think you're going?

1279
01:48:54,230 --> 01:48:55,670
Washington!

1280
01:48:55,770 --> 01:49:00,210
You going to shoot
a sitting U.S. Senator in the back?

1281
01:49:00,310 --> 01:49:01,860
Lord knows I want to.

1282
01:49:02,740 --> 01:49:04,180
I didn't think so.

1283
01:49:05,450 --> 01:49:06,640
Let him go.

1284
01:49:07,680 --> 01:49:09,310
They've got your rifle.

1285
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:13,350
From the beginning,
they've always had your rifle.

1286
01:49:13,450 --> 01:49:15,110
Recovered at the site.

1287
01:49:22,460 --> 01:49:25,120
You can talk as much as you want,
but in the end,

1288
01:49:24,630 --> 01:49:27,120
you're going to die by lethal injection,

1289
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:30,690
and I'm going to go back
to what I was doing.

1290
01:49:35,910 --> 01:49:37,030
I won.

1291
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:39,440
You lost.

1292
01:49:40,250 --> 01:49:42,410
Get used to the idea, son.

1293
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:44,320
I'm not your son.

1294
01:49:58,970 --> 01:50:01,230
- Drop your weapons! Put it down now!
- Don't move!

1295
01:50:01,330 --> 01:50:04,900
Special Agent Nick Memphis, FBI!
Don't shoot!

1296
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,170
- Down, now!
- On the ground!

1297
01:50:07,770 --> 01:50:08,800
I said get down!

1298
01:50:28,160 --> 01:50:30,790
- Could I free my hands, please?
- It's okay.

1299
01:50:30,900 --> 01:50:32,520
Thank you, sir.

1300
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,660
Thanks for bringing her.

1301
01:50:41,210 --> 01:50:43,840
Hey. I'm sorry about everything.

1302
01:50:43,940 --> 01:50:46,240
It's not your fault. It is what it is.

1303
01:50:49,980 --> 01:50:52,610
This is Attorney General Russert.

1304
01:50:53,620 --> 01:50:56,210
- Director Brandt.
- Sir.

1305
01:50:56,320 --> 01:50:58,650
Senator Meachum couldn't be
with us today.

1306
01:50:58,760 --> 01:51:00,920
I'm sure we can manage without him.

1307
01:51:01,030 --> 01:51:03,260
Sergeant Swagger,
you asked for this meeting.

1308
01:51:04,330 --> 01:51:07,560
Against my better judgment,
I've agreed to it as a favor to the FBI.

1309
01:51:07,670 --> 01:51:09,130
What the hell am I doing here?

1310
01:51:09,370 --> 01:51:11,460
You've got nothing on me. I'm covered.

1311
01:51:11,940 --> 01:51:13,340
Call the Joint Chief.

1312
01:51:14,970 --> 01:51:16,270
That won't be necessary, Colonel,

1313
01:51:16,380 --> 01:51:18,740
as I have already received
no less than a dozen calls

1314
01:51:18,850 --> 01:51:22,900
from highly-ranked
and powerfully-placed individuals

1315
01:51:21,940 --> 01:51:25,030
telling me to let you go.
But the joy of checks and balances
in our government is that I can,

1316
01:51:27,050 --> 01:51:30,850
and am, indeed, required by law,
to tell them to fuck off.

1317
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:32,620
This is about evidence
and finding out the truth,

1318
01:51:32,730 --> 01:51:34,660
so you sit there and be quiet.

1319
01:51:38,300 --> 01:51:40,290
Sergeant, you've got five minutes.

1320
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:41,530
Thank you.

1321
01:51:43,740 --> 01:51:45,470
This is my weapon.

1322
01:51:45,570 --> 01:51:47,900
No question about it, don't deny it.

1323
01:51:48,010 --> 01:51:50,370
You recovered it at the scene
moments after the assassination.

1324
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:51,440
We agree?

1325
01:51:52,180 --> 01:51:53,700
It's been in the FBI's possession
ever since,

1326
01:51:53,810 --> 01:51:55,210
hasn't been tampered with in any way?

1327
01:51:55,310 --> 01:51:56,840
No. Absolutely not.

1328
01:51:56,950 --> 01:51:59,080
- You fire the weapon?
- There was no point.

1329
01:51:59,190 --> 01:52:01,350
The slug was mangled
beyond recognition.

1330
01:52:01,450 --> 01:52:04,360
It was, however,
an exact metallurgical match.

1331
01:52:04,460 --> 01:52:06,820
Right. Definitely my bullets.

1332
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:09,620
Definitely my gun.

1333
01:52:09,730 --> 01:52:12,200
Special Agent Memphis,
you believe I shot that Archbishop?

1334
01:52:12,300 --> 01:52:13,820
Nope. No, I don't.

1335
01:52:13,930 --> 01:52:16,460
- Have any proof of this fact?
- No.

1336
01:52:16,570 --> 01:52:18,000
- Trust me?
- Yep.

1337
01:52:18,100 --> 01:52:19,260
Really trust me?

1338
01:52:19,640 --> 01:52:20,610
Yeah.

1339
01:52:21,670 --> 01:52:22,870
With your life?

1340
01:52:23,480 --> 01:52:24,880
- Yep.
- Good.

1341
01:52:26,450 --> 01:52:28,810
- What the hell are you doing?
- Put that weapon down now!

1342
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:31,750
If you're zeroed for 600,
you ought to aim a little lower.

1343
01:52:31,850 --> 01:52:33,340
Ain't gonna make a difference
this close.

1344
01:52:33,450 --> 01:52:36,210
Only thing that's gonna make a 
difference is whether I'm crazy or not.

1345
01:52:42,630 --> 01:52:44,390
I could keep doing this all day,

1346
01:52:45,130 --> 01:52:46,720
with every weapon in my house.

1347
01:52:47,230 --> 01:52:50,290
I swapped all the firing pins
before I left the house. I always do.

1348
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:52,430
Looks right, need a micrometer to tell.

1349
01:52:52,910 --> 01:52:54,270
But the gun don't shoot.

1350
01:52:54,670 --> 01:52:56,670
That bullet you got out of that bishop
was fired from my weapon,

1351
01:52:56,780 --> 01:52:58,540
but a week before, at a can of stew.

1352
01:52:58,640 --> 01:53:01,880
I did take an oath to defend this country
from all enemies, foreign and domestic.

1353
01:53:01,980 --> 01:53:04,280
I just didn't figure I'd end up
quite this involved.

1354
01:53:04,380 --> 01:53:06,150
But at the end of the day,
when all the dust settles,

1355
01:53:06,250 --> 01:53:08,810
you can't hide from the truth,
you son of a bitch.

1356
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:11,250
Whatever.

1357
01:53:12,020 --> 01:53:13,490
Who gives a shit?

1358
01:53:14,830 --> 01:53:16,290
Nice presentation.

1359
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:18,190
But none of it sticks to me.

1360
01:53:19,400 --> 01:53:22,600
Gentlemen, this meeting is over.

1361
01:53:22,700 --> 01:53:23,960
Done.

1362
01:53:24,070 --> 01:53:25,400
I'll be seeing you.

1363
01:53:25,510 --> 01:53:28,700
He's right. There's nothing
to prove he did anything.

1364
01:53:28,810 --> 01:53:30,000
Yeah, in this country.

1365
01:53:30,110 --> 01:53:32,740
Sir, you should take a look at these.

1366
01:53:38,150 --> 01:53:43,610
These images are from a classified file
showing a village of people in Africa

1367
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:46,420
that were exterminated
by the colonel and his associates.

1368
01:53:46,530 --> 01:53:47,490
My God.

1369
01:53:47,690 --> 01:53:48,890
Look around you.

1370
01:53:49,460 --> 01:53:51,590
This isn't the Horn of Africa.

1371
01:53:51,700 --> 01:53:53,260
That's all hearsay.

1372
01:53:53,370 --> 01:53:55,990
This is the land of the free
and the home of the brave.

1373
01:53:56,100 --> 01:53:57,540
And I'm free to go.

1374
01:53:58,170 --> 01:53:59,970
Colonel, your moral compass is
so fucked up,

1375
01:54:00,070 --> 01:54:04,010
I'll be shocked if you manage
to find your way back to the parking lot.

1376
01:54:04,110 --> 01:54:06,240
Regardless of how I feel about this,

1377
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:08,770
these events occurred
in another country,

1378
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:10,180
outside of our laws.

1379
01:54:10,280 --> 01:54:12,810
So that's it? That's the best you can do?

1380
01:54:12,920 --> 01:54:14,940
This isn't the World Court, Sergeant.

1381
01:54:15,820 --> 01:54:18,120
And I don't have the jurisdiction
to detain the colonel

1382
01:54:18,220 --> 01:54:20,890
for crimes he may or may not have
committed on another continent.

1383
01:54:20,990 --> 01:54:24,520
- Sir, I urge you to reconsider...
- There's nothing to reconsider, son.

1384
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,630
I win.

1385
01:54:29,740 --> 01:54:30,960
You lose.

1386
01:54:31,700 --> 01:54:32,670
Again.

1387
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:36,600
This is ridiculous.

1388
01:54:58,900 --> 01:55:02,460
For the record, I don't like the way
this turned out any more than you do.

1389
01:55:03,170 --> 01:55:05,070
But this is the world we live in.

1390
01:55:05,170 --> 01:55:08,110
And justice does not always prevail.

1391
01:55:08,210 --> 01:55:09,170
It's not the Wild West,

1392
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:11,570
where you can clean up the streets
with a gun.

1393
01:55:12,910 --> 01:55:15,750
Even though sometimes
that's exactly what's needed.

1394
01:55:20,390 --> 01:55:22,920
Bob Lee Swagger, you're free to go.

1395
01:55:27,060 --> 01:55:28,860
Unshackle the sergeant.

1396
01:55:32,200 --> 01:55:34,430
I'd say that's quite a shot, Senator.

1397
01:55:34,530 --> 01:55:35,800
In the face.

1398
01:55:37,200 --> 01:55:39,430
You heard that expression,

1399
01:55:39,540 --> 01:55:41,840
"You didn't know whether to shit
or go blind"?

1400
01:55:45,810 --> 01:55:49,040
You should've seen the look
on the Attorney General's face.

1401
01:55:50,150 --> 01:55:54,450
Did he give his
checks-and-balances speech?

1402
01:55:54,550 --> 01:55:57,950
"This is about evidence and the truth!"

1403
01:55:58,060 --> 01:56:00,580
And then you just said to him,

1404
01:56:00,690 --> 01:56:01,990
"Fuck you!"

1405
01:56:03,060 --> 01:56:05,460
"Hold my cigar, Mr. A.G."

1406
01:56:07,730 --> 01:56:09,030
"Fuck you!

1407
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:13,240
"The truth is what I say it is!"

1408
01:56:20,310 --> 01:56:22,640
You know, you got to be
out of the country in the morning.

1409
01:56:22,750 --> 01:56:24,510
You're going to Ecuador.

1410
01:56:27,990 --> 01:56:31,580
Well, we're having some problems
with the locals.

1411
01:56:31,690 --> 01:56:35,250
We have our personnel on the ground
ready to neutralize the problem, but...

1412
01:56:35,530 --> 01:56:37,220
Well, they've requested you.

1413
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:40,360
It's solvable.

1414
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:44,230
They requested you...

1415
01:56:46,570 --> 01:56:47,600
Swagger.

1416
01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:53,540
Turn off the lights!

1417
01:57:01,120 --> 01:57:02,140
Get my car.

1418
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:03,450
Get my car.

1419
01:57:23,310 --> 01:57:24,280
Do something.

1420
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:26,310
Do something!

1421
01:57:34,620 --> 01:57:35,750
Where is he?

1422
01:57:48,430 --> 01:57:49,560
He's under the floor!

1423
01:58:20,370 --> 01:58:21,960
You don't need to kill me.

1424
01:58:23,300 --> 01:58:24,930
You don't need to kill me. It was them.

1425
01:58:25,370 --> 01:58:26,340
It was them.

1426
01:58:29,140 --> 01:58:31,910
God damn it! Just wait a minute!

1427
01:58:34,110 --> 01:58:36,510
Hold it just a minute. Hold it.
