Hairy is out. Your turn, Teddy Bear.

15
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,140
不要  我喜欢毛茸茸的
Oh, no, I love my Teddy.

16
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,930
卡尔文·克莱因可不喜欢呢
Calvin Klein would not approve.

17
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,030
棒球赛开始了
Baseball game is on

18
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,610
意味着我的夏天也正式开始了
and my summer has officially begun.

19
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:56,980
问题是  他真是这么想的
The thing is, he actually means it.

20
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,770
-宝贝  -你好吗
- Hey, baby. - How are you?

- Cold beer? - No, I've already had a couple.

军衔很高呀  中尉  厉害
Nice stripes, Lieutenant. Hot.

23
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,040
拜托  上尉
Oh, please -- Captain.

24
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,990
刚从预备部队回来
Just got back from the Reserves.

25
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:11,570
我每个月能做一次真男人
You know what they say, once a month I get to play a real man.

26
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,520

Oh, haven't seen you at the gym lately.

27
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,860
布鲁斯

00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,360
-到你了  布鲁斯  -到我干嘛了
- Your turn, Bruce. - What? What?

29
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,980
布鲁斯  拜托  别让我们在沙滩上丢脸  亲爱的
Brucey, please, don't embarrass our house at the beach, hon.

30
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,060
这下非去不可了
Uh-oh. Gotta do it.

31
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,380
奈德  你知道  俗语有云
You know what they say, Ned.

32
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,060
如果你无法战胜他们
If you can't beat 'em...

33
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,650
那就加入他们
join 'em.

34
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,390
这就是我男人
That's my guy.

35
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,140
克雷格知道你没兴趣时难过死了
Craig was miserable when you weren't interested.

36
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,540
可他有罗伯特·雷福德呢
Now look. He's got Robert Redford.

37
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,110
果然老天有眼
Shows you there is a God.

38
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,130
-约翰怎么样  -约翰
- How's John? - John?

39
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,390
-约翰  -约翰  约翰啊
- John. - John? Oh, John.

40
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,940
不行  我现在跟格里高利在一起呢
No, I'm with Gregory now.

41
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,750
庆祝在一起15个月整
We're celebrating our 15-month anniversary.

42
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,210
15个月  这对你来说可真是够久的  米奇
15? That's a long time for you, Mickey.

43
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,960
拜托  虽说我们是恋人  而且还同居了
Oh, please, we're lovers and we live together.

44
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,050
但这不代表我们就要对彼此忠贞
It's not like we're faithful to each other, too.

45
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,960
他都不是犹太人  别告诉我的拉比
He's not even Jewish. Don't tell my rabbi.

46
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,650
天啊
My God. 

47
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,890
威克斯  你逊爆了
Hey, Weeks, you suck.

48
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,640
你还跑这来干吗
Why do you even come here anymore?

49
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,350
我们不想见到你
We don't want you.

50
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,800
你在小说里把我们写得不堪入目
You made us look terrible in your novel.

51
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,820
你环顾一下四周  性是自由的
Look around you. Sex is liberating.

52
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:32,580
我只是说越是乱性就越难找到真爱
All I said was having so much sex makes finding love impossible.

53
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,940
你自己找不到对象
Do not put your failure to find someone

54
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,000
-别怪我们  -奈德
- on the rest of us. - Neddy!

55
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,010
天啊
Oh, jeez.

56
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,730
天啊
Oh, God.

57
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,370
伙计们
Guys!

58
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,180
发生什么事了
Hey, what happened?

59
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,330
-你没事吧  -我没事
- You okay? - I'm okay.

60
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,160
只是有点头晕眼花
Just got a little lightheaded.

61
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,900
我能站起来  没事的
I got myself up. I'm fine.

62
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,740
只是有点头晕
I just got a little dizzy.

63
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,160
他看起来没事
He seemed okay.

64
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,240
祝你生日快乐
Happy birthday to you

65
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,940
祝你生日快乐
Happy birthday to you

66
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:31,670
祝你生日快乐  亲爱的克雷格
Happy birthday, dear Craig

67
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:38,180
祝你生日快乐
Happy birthday to you.

68
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,520
-吹吧  -这可是他的拿手活
- Blow.  - He's good at that.

69
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,570
我他妈的爱死这里了
I fucking love this place!

70
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,230
当我们
When we're

71
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,200
在舞池里翩翩起舞
On the dance floor

72
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,150
我能感觉到
And I feel

73
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,700
感觉到你的身体
And I feel your body

74
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,400
我知道  我的爱人
And I know my love,

75
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,630
让我觉得
Make me feel

76
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,180
让我觉得
Make me feel

77
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,310
你令我觉得
You make me feel

78
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,980
奈德  奈德
Ned! Hey, Ned!

79
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,700
来吧  求你了
Come on. Please?

80
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,560
无比真实
Mighty real

81
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,820
你令我觉得
You make me feel

82
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:46,040
无比真实
Mighty real.

83
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,400
我以前在布利克街的法国公馆
I sold you a ceramic pig once

84
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,260
卖过你一只陶瓷猪
at Maison France on Bleecker Street.

85
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,490
我是桑福德
I'm Sanford.

86
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,320
对啊  我记得你
Yes, I remember.

87
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,750
你是我一个爱收藏猪的老朋友
Somebody I was friends with then collected pigs

88
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,010
你那里的那只假猪
and you had the biggest pig I'd ever seen

89
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,230
是我见过最大的
outside a real pig.

90
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,770
这些玩意越长越大
They just keep getting bigger

91
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,380
永远也好不了
and won't go away.

92
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,300
我是她的第二十例患者
I'm her 20th case.

93
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,590
其中有六名已经死了
And six of them are dead.

94
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,960
奈德  快到你了
Hey, Ned. Won't be a minute.

95
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,780
巴兹  没想到你在这工作
Hey, Buzzy. I didn't know you worked here.

96
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,660
下一位是谁
Who are you?

97
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,080
我叫奈德·威克斯
Uh, Ned Weeks.

98
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,520
你在《时代》发表文章后我留过言
I spoke to you after the "Times" Article.

99
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,860
请进  把衣服脱掉
Come in. Take your clothes off.

100
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,200
我只是想来问几个问题
I only came to ask some questions.

101
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,220
你是同志吧
You are gay, aren't you?

102
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,080
是
Yes.

103
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,770
把衣服脱了  不用紧张
Take your clothes off. Don't be nervous.

104
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,540
我见的男人比你多多了
I've seen more men than you have.

105
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,750
你的所有问题  我只能说不知道
To answer all of your questions, I don't know.

106
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,850
这种情况是我闻所未闻的
I've never seen or heard of anything like this.

107
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,290
你有过什么症状吗
Have you had any of the symptoms?

108
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,080
文章中提到的大部分破玩意吧
Most of the shit the "Times" said,

109
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,060
变形虫  淋病  肝炎什么的
amoebas, gonorrhea, hepatitis.

110
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,340
你是不知道性解放之后
You don't know what it's been like

111
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,630
人们都在做什么
since the sexual revolution.

112
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,130
我怎么不知道
What makes you think I don't?

113
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,710
有没有发烧  盗汗  体重减轻
Any fever, night sweats, weight loss?

114
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,670
我倒想减重  都没有
Don't I wish. No.

115
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,040
有没有淤青  张嘴
And purple lesions? Open your mouth.

116
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,120
这是一种癌症
It's a cancer.

117
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,040
是免疫系统一种奇怪的反应
There's a strange reaction in the immune system.

118
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,350
让你的免疫系统崩溃  丧失抵抗能力
It's collapsed. Won't fight.

119
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,250
我的大部分患者出现的症状
So the diseases most of my patients are coming down with

120
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,480
都是由于细菌感染
are brought on by germs

121
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,790
可是病原菌弱得不能再弱
that wouldn't hurt a baby.

122
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,020
好难对付
Ticklish.

123
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,510
起码这细菌在纽约很弱
At least not a baby in New York City anyway.

124
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,150
免疫系统是我们最不了解的系统
The immune system is the system we know the least about.

125
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,920
我听说你是出名的大嘴巴
So where's this big mouth I hear you've got?

126
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,200
-大嘴巴也是症状吗  -不
- Is big mouth a symptom? - No.

127
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,280
是治疗手段
It's a cure.

128
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,310
这病好像只在同志圈里有
This seems to only be happening to gay men.

129
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:40,570
巴兹说你在同志圈里很有名气
Buzzy says you are well-known in the gay community

130
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,750
畅所欲言  毫无畏惧
and not afraid to say what you think.

131
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,440
没人来领导同志群体
I can't find any gay leaders

132
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,840
我也联系了同志组织  可是没人回应
and I call gay organizations, no one ever calls me back.

133
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,490
布鲁克纳医生
Dr. Brookner,

134
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,580
但凡有点脑子的人
no one with half a brain

135
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,360
都不会插手同志政治
gets involved with gay politics.

136
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,650
因为没有批判的权利
There's no room for criticism.

137
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:54,820
你要批判什么
What's your criticism?

138
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,840
我受够了总是扮演受害者
I hate that we play victim

139
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,960
其实我们中的很多人
when many of us,

140
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,190
甚至大多数人  都不至如此
most of us, don't have to.

141
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,020
现在需要的就是你这样的人
Then you're exactly what's needed now.

142
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,860
也许他们只是在等待
Maybe they're just waiting for

143
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,910
等待有人出来领导他们
someone to lead them.

144
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,280
我可不想当这个领导
I don't want to lead them.

145
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,310
你到底想让我干什么
What exactly are you trying to get me to do?

146
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,570
告诉同志们别乱搞了
Tell gay men to stop having sex.

147
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,460
你觉得这种癌症是通过性交传染的吗
Do you think that this cancer is sexually transmitted?

148
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,870
没错  我是这么觉得
I think it is, yes.

149
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,250
我现在能不能证明  不能
Can I prove it yet? No.

150
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,760
你有没有意识到
Do you realize that

151
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,030
你把矛头指向了上百万的人
you're talking about millions of men

152
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,300
他们都把乱交
who have singled out promiscuity

153
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,940
当成政治理想一般的存在
as their principal political agenda?

154
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,500
这你要怎么处理
How do you deal with that?

155
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,030
告诉他们这样有生命危险
Tell them they may die.

156
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,960
-在哪  -大厅  大厅
- Where? - Down the hall. Down the hall!

157
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,300
没那么简单  复杂多了
It's not that simple. It's more complicated than that.

158
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,020
他们觉得性是自己的全部
They think sex is all they have.

159
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,940
威克斯先生  如果性交有生命危险
Mr. Weeks, if having sex can kill you,

160
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,490
是不是但凡有点脑子的人
doesn't anyone with half a brain

161
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,880
都不会乱搞了
stop fucking?

162
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,230
你可以走了  你没有任何症状
You can go. I'm not finding what I'm looking for here.

163
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,770
-在哪里  -开门
- Where? - Open up!

164
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:56,350
-在哪  在哪  -就在那屋
- Where? Where? - Right in that room.

165
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,240
把他抬到桌子上
Just put him up on the table.

166
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,180
就是这儿  测下脉搏
Up here. Let's find a pulse.

167
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,290
放轻松  宝贝
Baby, easy.

168
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,910
-平静下来  -能告诉我发生了什么吗
- Be still. - Can you tell me what happened?

169
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,360
我们在外面等他
We were meeting him outside.

170
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,790
拐了个弯  他就倒了下来
We turned the corner and he just collapsed.

171
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,820
上帝啊
Jesus!

172
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,180
别他妈在街上瞎晃荡
Hey, get the fuck out of the street!

173
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:22,620
亲爱的
Baby!

174
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,080
-天啊  -来人
- Oh, my God! - Help!

175
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,840
-谁是他爱人  -我是  女士
- Who's the lover? - I am, ma'am.

176
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,720
-你叫什么  -布鲁斯·耐尔斯
- What's your name? - Bruce Niles.

177
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,260
我是布鲁克纳  马上给我一间房
Brookner. I need a room immediately.

178
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,660
耐尔斯  你是莱因哈特的男朋友
Niles, you were Reinhardt's boyfriend.

179
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,420
是的  女士  你怎么知道的
Yes, ma'am. How do you know that?

180
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,750
他三周前去世了
He died three weeks ago.

181
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,430
他们不让我和他道别
Wouldn't even let me say goodbye.

182
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:22,490
都不让我和他吻别
Not even let me kiss him goodbye.

183
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,570
他去世了
He's dead?

184
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,830
节哀
So sorry.

185
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,850
这病能这么快致人死亡
It can happen this fast?

186
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,090
这不就是例子吗
It just did.

187
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,970
我们得做点什么
We have to do something.

188
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,680
别人不会关心的
No one else will.

189
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,140
我们该做什么
What are we supposed to do?

190
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,030
你只考察了46个病例就做了猜想
You make these assumptions on the basis of 46 cases.

191
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,290
你们想知道我的想法  我就是这么认为的
You wanted to know what I think. This is what I think.

192
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,530
你们会互相传染
You are all going to infect each other.

193
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,800
现在只有少部分人染病
Now only a few of you have.

194
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,100
但不幸的是我们无法辨别是谁
Unfortunately, we can't tell yet which ones.

195
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,300
早在分离出肝炎病毒前
Long before we isolated the hepatitis viruses,

196
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,300
我们就知道了病症
we knew about the diseases they caused

197
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,590
以及传播途径
and how they got around.

198
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,410
医学期刊上的文章呢  纽约时报呢
Where are the medical journals? The "Times"?

199
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:43,850
我早在一年前就把报告寄给医学杂志了
I sent my first reports to the medical journals over a year ago.

200
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,840
不好意思  你怎么知道你要找什么
Excuse me, how do you know what you're looking for,

201
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,240
就一句  不知道找什么的话从何找起呢
real quick, if you don't know what you're looking for?

202
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,900
不好意思  估计这问题有点蠢
I'm sorry, I guess that's a dumb question.

203
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,560
并非如此  这是最睿智的问题了
No, it isn't. It's the smartest question of all

204
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,050
也是最难回答的
and the hardest one to answer.

205
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,620
你们就不能稍微收敛一下吗
Doesn't common sense tell you you should cool it for a while?

206
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,800
为什么不呢
Why not?

207
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,760
那样活着还有什么劲
That doesn't leave much to look forward to.

208
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,250
要是最后你错了怎么办
What if it turns out that you're wrong?

209
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,020
让她说
Let her speak!

210
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,970
只是稍微收敛一下
The worst that could happen

211
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,550
有什么大不了的
would be that you cooled it for a while.

212
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,780
不对  不好意思
No, excuse me. Excuse me.

213
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:18,160
不好意思  不是没什么大不了的
Excuse me. That is not the worst that will have happened.

214
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,150
大家会害怕做爱
Guys will become frightened of sex.

215
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,380
我们会失去我们为之
We will lose our self-respect

216
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,200
奋斗许久的自尊
that we fought very, very hard for.

217
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,210
我们会成为最悲惨的替罪羊
We will be scapegoated worse than ever.

218
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,350
全世界都会认为我们是携带者
The world will think we're carriers

219
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,790
占领道德高地的人更会大放厥词
and the Moral Majority will have even more of a field day.

220
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,810
这坐轮椅的婊子不走我就不来了
I am not coming back until this bitch on wheels is gone.

221
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,740
等等  病人的数量越来越多
Wait! I see more cases each week than the week before.

222
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,790
一半的病人都死了
Half of all my patients die.

223
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,440
好了  赶紧总结一下
Okay, I hope she winds this up,

224
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,780
新罗谢尔还有几个帅哥等着呢
'cause I've got a tiny little orgy in New Rochelle.

225
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,870
卫生部呢  市长呢
Where's the health department? Where's the mayor?

226
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,990
-闭嘴吧  约翰  -你闭嘴吧  亲
- Shut the fuck up, John. - Oh, you shut the fuck up, hon.

227
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,530
人数有多少
What are the numbers?

228
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,740
每次同志聚会都这样吗
Is every gay meeting like this?

229
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,770
一半人来都是为了找人滚床单
Half these people just showed up to get laid.

230
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,090
安静  安静
Quiet! Quiet!

231
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,820
我们要成立一个小组
We're starting a group. 

232
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,540
我们要成立一个健康危机处理小组
We're starting a health crisis group.

233
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,880
我们会再次在这里开会
We're gonna meet here again.

234
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:18,820
下次  带点吃的来
Next time, bring some fucking food.

235
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,950
这可不好
Hey, hey, hey. That's not nice.

236
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,950
这就是同志群体的政治
Welcome to gay politics.

237
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,570
我跟克雷格·克莱本
Yeah, I'm very late for

238
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,360
有个很重要的会  我迟到半天了
an important meeting with Craig Claiborne.

239
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,480
他正在等我
He's expecting me.

240
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,730
-你好  菲利克斯·特纳  -你是
- Hi, Felix Turner. - And you are?

241
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,470
我叫奈德·威克斯
My name's Ned Weeks.

242
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,230
你好帅
You're very cute.

243
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,170
我现在很忙  明白吗
You caught me at a rough moment, all right?

244
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,120
马上就要交稿了  第一夫人来了
I have a deadline. The First Lady is coming to town.

245
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,710
我听说你是同性恋  你也许可以
I've been told you're gay and you might be able

246
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,990
帮我在《纽约时报》上刊登些重要消息
to help me get some vital information in the "Times."

247
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,150
你听说吗
You've "been told"?

248
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,680
听谁说的
And who was it that told you?

249
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,840
亲爱的  谁不知道啊
Oh, honey, everybody's talking about it.

250
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,550
为什么每个同志
Why does everyone gay

251
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,060
都以为《纽约时报》是我家的
think that I run "The New York Times"?

252
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,210
我帮不上忙
I can't help you with this.

253
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,270
深表同情  那我还能怎么办
Sorry to hear that. What would you suggest I do?

254
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,680
那是你的事  我还有23个党派
Take your pick. I got 23 parties,

255
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,940
37家新餐馆和12家新舞厅要写
37 new restaurants, 12 new discos.

256
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,910
听着  我跟好几个记者谈过了
Listen, I can't get anyone here to write another article.

257
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,820
没人肯帮我写
I've talked to half a dozen reporters

258
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,800
哪怕是之前写过同志题材的
and the guy who worked on the first piece.

259
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,040
兰德先生吗  当然不会
Mr. Leather? Yeah, no.

260
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,570
这里的每一个人都不会写  包括我
No one here will write about it and I can't.

261
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,870
我们这里有很明确的分工
Look, we're very compartmentalized.

262
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,330
写科学栏目的不会写羊毛衫
You wouldn't want science to write about sweaters, would you?

263
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,100
在这个异性恋主导的世界里
It's a very peculiar feeling having to go out

264
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,420
为同志群体寻求帮助是非常微妙的
and seek support from a straight world for something gay.

265
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,530
我怎么可能知道
I wouldn't know about that.

266
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:24,300
我一直在写同性恋设计师  舞厅
I just write about gay designers and gay discos

267
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,750
厨师  模特  摇滚歌手
and gay chefs and gay models and gay rock stars

268
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,480
以及同性恋名人  所有关于同性恋的事
and gay celebrities and gay everything.

269
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,420
我只是不用同性恋这个词
I just don't call them gay.

270
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:32,900
那你是不是该用这个词了
Isn't it time you start?

271
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,320
我真的要交稿了
Look, I really do have a deadline,

272
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,150
我丢饭碗对你也没好处
and you wouldn't want me to get fired.

273
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,690
让让可以吗
Would you?

274
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,570
真是受不了你这种人
Guys like you give me a pain in the ass.

275
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,610
-你是写书的吧  -是的
- You in the book? - Yes.

我们急需帮助  一分钱也行

我觉得你可以温和点
I think you could be a little less aggressive.

286
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,250
温和点  我们之前就是太温和了
Less aggressive? We've tried that.

287
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,100
能为我们的团体捐点钱吗

有趣的是  我妈妈还送了花
It's funny. My mother sent flowers.

291
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,980
我没跟她说过我是同性恋
And I had never told her I was gay.

292
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,540
我只说克雷格去世了

我觉得她知道

妈妈们总是知道
I think somehow mothers always know.

295
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:00,100
花五百万买栋房子  吓死你了吧
Doesn't spending $5 million on a house frighten you?

296
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:04,750
让你为我理财才吓死我了
Scared the shit out of me even having you handling my finances.

297
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,660
你什么时候想要房子都可以
You can have a house anytime you want.

298
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,930
这倒提醒了我  你需要更多的钱
Which reminds me, your account needs more money.

你干得还不错

- I like movies. - Do I detect a note of approval

302
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,640
终于肯表扬我了吗
from the big brother that called me "Lemon"?

303
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,300
我不想要房子
I don't want a house.

304
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:23,870
那你为什么在乡下找了那么久房子

- No fun living in it alone. - This Bruce...

306
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,560
是你男朋友吗
is he someone you're seeing?

307
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,950
我对他有意思  他对我无感
I see him, he doesn't see me.

308
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,010
本
Ben...

309
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:38,480
你们公司能无偿帮忙吗
could your law firm take this on for free?

310
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,980
为公益出一份力
What's it called? Pro bono?

311
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:43,020
我们为一种新疾病成立了一个组织
We started an organization, I told you there's this new disease.

312
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,890
是不是你不想写书  找的新借口啊
Now this sounds like just another excuse to keep from writing.

313
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,520
你就不能答应我吗
Why can't you just say "Yes"?

314
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,410
我告诉过你  这些事
I told you, because we have a committee

315
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:50,970
要由委员会来决定

00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,520
但你是资深合伙人
But you're the senior partner

317

你好  马里奥  荷马还好吗

If you're not gonna help, I'm gonna have to find somebody else.

320
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,490
你大可去找别人帮忙
Well, you're more than free to do that.

321
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,680
我不想弄到这种地步
I don't want to do that.

322
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,330
我希望我出色的哥哥

I'll ask my partners' approval at the next meeting.

328
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:23,750
我来游说  你好像没什么把握
I'll lobby them. You don't sound like a very sure vote.

329
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:33,060
好吧
Okay.

330
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,630
你的表现越来越好了
You're getting better at it.

331
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,350
我每周会有三到四名新患者

332

重症病房里有七名

333
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,910
整个医院只能容纳三十名患者
The whole hospital only has room for 30.

334
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,000
我不得不以其他病因收治病人
I've had to admit some of them under other illnesses.

335
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,590
已经违反原则了
That's a no-no.

336
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:56,050
有二十个人住在私人病房  付不起钱
I've got 20 in private rooms they can't afford.

337
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,910
好吧  那些没有医疗保险的人怎么办...
Okay, what about the guys who don't have health insurance...

338
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:01,180
-艺术家  演员  -我让他们住在了
- Artists, actors? - I've got eight of them in another ward

339
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,430
他们不该住的另一间病房
where I shouldn't put them.

340
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,080
你为什么不戴手套和面罩
Why don't you wear gloves and a face mask?

341
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:17,750
我从没戴过  以后也不会戴
I never have and I never will.

342
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,820
但我还活着
And I'm still here.

343
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,040
为什么食物都像这样放在房间外面
Why is all the food sitting outside their rooms like this?

344
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,750
-都要凉了  -每次都是凉的
- It's getting cold. - It's always cold

345
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,850
因为工作人员不肯送进去
because the appropriate staff won't bring it into the rooms,

346
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:30,450
没人肯送  就只好烂在这里
so it sits and rots until one of my staff can.

347
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,800

I know him. Can I go inside with you?

353
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,060
你得戴上护具
Only if you wear all the protective shit.

354
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,160
你不戴我也不戴
If you don't, I don't.

你能把我的狗带来吗

它离了我可活不了
He won't know how to live without me.

370

411
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,890
妈妈是服务员

412
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:15,090
在沃尔格林里开过小吃店
Had a luncheonette in Walgreens.

413
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,780
多了不起啊  一个小孩走出乡下
It's amazing, isn't it? How a kid comes out of all that

414
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,910
在《纽约时报》扬名立万
and wind up on the "Times",

415
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:24,450
左右着世界的品味和风格
dictating taste and style to the entire world.

416
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,270
你又不会好好说话了
And we were just starting to talk so nicely.

417
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:29,140
我说的话没有问题
Talking's not my problem.

418
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,620
只是不知道何时闭嘴
Shutting up's my problem.

419
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,700
你为什么总是写华而不实的舞会礼服
Why do you write all that fancy ball gown bullshit?

420
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:36,110
我打赌你每天还是会看
I bet you gobble it up every day.

421
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,470
死去的人里  我认识十个
I know 10 people who have died.

422
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,000
我找你的时候  才一个
When I came to you, it was only one.

423
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,190
抱歉
I'm sorry.

424
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,360
所以你才答应这次约会的吗
Is that why you agreed to this date?

425
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:57,220
左手拿叉
Fork on the left.

426
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,840
右手拿刀
Knife on the right.

427
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,120
你知道希特勒除掉波兰犹太人的
Did you know that Hitler's Final Solution

428
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,790
屠杀方案是最先在

429
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:09,170
《纽约时报》第二十八版披露的吗
was first mentioned in the "Times"? It was on page 28.

430
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,210
还有《华盛顿邮报》的第六版
On page 6 of the "Washington Post."

431
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,610
都是犹太人经营的报纸  他们自己的族人
They are both owned by Jews. Their very own people.

432
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,160
学者们终于写出了
Scholars are finally writing

433
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,260
真实情况  却不受待见
honestly about it and it's damning to everyone.

434
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,620
基督教会  教皇  丘吉尔和罗斯福去哪了
Where is the Christian churches? The Pope? Churchill? Roosevelt?

435
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,900
他们随便说句话都能让大家警惕希特勒
A few words from any of them would have put Hitler on notice.

436
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,560
达豪集中营1933年建成  大家都他妈在哪
Dachau was open in 1933. Where the fuck was everybody?

437
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,380
今晚的气氛真是浪漫
This is turning out to be a very romantic evening.

438
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,650
你从来没有过爱人  是吗
You've never had a lover, have you?

439
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:35,130
我猜你爱人不少
I suppose you've had quite a few.

440
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:36,880
我有过一个非常好的
I had a very good one.

441
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,220
交往了很多年  谢谢夸奖
For a number of years, thank you.

442
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,350
他年纪比我大  又找了更年轻的
He was older than I was and he found someone younger.

443
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,840
你想找父亲型的吗
You looking for a father?

444
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,610
不  我不想找父亲型的  天呐
No, I'm not looking for a father. God.

445
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:50,280
你嘴真毒
You're relentless.

446
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:00,480
好吧
Okay.

447
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,460
那是你的
That's yours.

448
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:05,370
大家都有无数的理由置身事外
Everybody had a million reasons for not getting involved.

449
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:08,400
美国犹太人分明知道在发生什么
The American Jews knew exactly what was going on.

450
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:09,570
想一想  所有犹太人
Could you imagine if every

451
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,880
一起向华盛顿进发是什么样
Jew had marched on Washington proudly, huh?

452
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,510
奈德
Ned.

453
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,490
你不记得我了  是吗
You don't remember me, do you?

454
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:20,390
是几年前在一间浴室
It was at the baths a few years ago.

455
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,630
探寻"男人国度"  发现我们的实力
Come to Man's Country, see what we're all about

456
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:26,880
和呈现给您的一切
and what we have to offer.

457
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,690
"男人国度"是设施齐全  功能多样
Man's Country is a full facility, multileveled complex

458
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:33,200
为满足各色需求而设的场所
that was designed to feature something for everyone.

459
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,990
来"男人国度"健美塑身
Come to Man's Country to develop your body...

460
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,620
或塑造与他人的友谊
or a friendship with somebody else's.

461
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,520
踏进我们  您便会欲罢不能
Visit us once and you'll come again and again.

462
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:59,690
你看我的样子  让我觉得
You would've thought I was applying for the CIA

463
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:00,730
是中情局在考察我
the way you looked at me.

464
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,290
然后怎么了
And then what happened?

465
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,600
我跟着你进了隔间
I followed you into your room.

466
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,840
你连眼睛都不睁开
You couldn't even open your eyes.

467
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,100
跟我说你的真名是亚历山大
You told me your real name was Alexander.

468
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:38,100
我问你是做什么的  你说自己
I asked what you did and you said something like

469
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,210
"试过不少事情"  然后...
you "tried a number of things" and...

470
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,310
我问你试过爱别人吗
I asked if that had included love.

471
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,400
你回我说
That's when you said, 

472
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,100
"我明早还要早起"
"I have to get up early in the morning."

473
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:57,000
人心里都是有爱的
Men do not naturally not love.

474
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,370
除非后天磨灭掉
They learn not to.

475
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,700
你觉得你是虚张声势
I think you're a bluffer.

476
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,080
我怎么会不记得你
How could I not remember you?

477
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,240
不知道
I don't know.

478
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:14,160
当时挺暗的
It was very dark.

479
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,460
你觉着我们能重新来过吗
Do you think we could start over?

480
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,890
我上耶鲁时  以为我是里面唯一的同志
When I was going to Yale, I thought I was the only gay guy there.

481
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,070
不骗你
Swear to God.

482
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,920
去看心理医生  他还试图改变我
Went to the shrink who tried to change me.

483
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,110
现在学校里都有"同志周"了
Now they have "Gay Weeks" there

484
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,800
办的舞会是全校最棒的
and they throw the best dances of anyone.

485
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,580
试想一下  你能和你男朋友
Imagine being able to dance cheek to cheek

486
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:37,470
在美好的大学时光里相拥共舞
with your boyfriend during your bright college days.

487
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,790
你和女人睡过吗
Did you ever sleep with a woman?

488
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,910
怎么
What?

489
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:55,680
她叫黛利拉
Her name was... Delilah.

490
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,130
黛利拉
Delilah?

491
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,260
她是
She was...

492
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,810
是我写的一部电影里的替身演员
a stand-in on this movie I wrote.

493
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,780
她人很好也很漂亮
She was very nice and pretty.

494
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,070
总是冲我笑
Always smiling at me.

495
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:12,850
我就去问我的一个直男朋友这是什么意思
So I-- I asked a straight friend to explain it to me.

496
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,680
其实我知道  就是想确认下
I thought I knew, but I just wanted to make sure.

497
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,980
我就带她去吃晚餐
And I had her to dinner and...

498
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:22,670
之后  我就在我认为合适的时间
afterwards, what I deemed to be a suitable moment

499
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:24,770
因为我一直在跟"下面"沟通
because I had been communicating with it down there--

500
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:27,550
"你准备好了吗  你真的真的准备好了吗"
"Are you ready? Are you absolutely certain you're ready?"

501
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,380
等到下面的小哥准备好了
And when it appeared "Abercrombie" was ready.

502
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:34,060
我抱起她  像白瑞德抱斯嘉丽[乱世佳人]一样
I picked her up, very Rhett Butler,

503
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,790
轻轻放到床上
and carried her to my bed,

504
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,740
但我却硬不起来了
where I couldn't get it up. 

505
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,800
-但是  -这点我感同身受
- But-- - I can certainly relate to that.

506
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,720
大半夜里
In the middle of the night,

507
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,400
我醒来  下面硬的生猛
I woke up with this gigantic erection,

508
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,440
天知道怎么搞的
God-- God knows how.

509
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,760
所以我把她摇醒了  大喊
So I shake her, shouting,

510
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,740
快帮我插进去  黛利拉
"Please stick it in for me, Delilah."

511
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,920
我当时特别担心
I was afraid of it going away before I could-- -

512
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,840
看到关键部位会软
while I was hunting for the right place to put it.

513
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:02,600
她高潮了  我也高潮了  小哥也是
She did and I did, and Abercrombie did.

514
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,860
第二天早上我醒来
The next morning I woke up

515
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,830
想起那个神神叨叨
and I, who had been under the spell of this shrink

516
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,910
一心改变我的心理医生
who was determined to change me,

517
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:17,660
我就冲到他办公室
rushed into his office.

518
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:20,050
我这个从七年级
And I, who had been fucking with fellows

519
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:21,880
就跟小伙伴乱搞的人
since the 7th grade,

520
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:25,130
在三十二岁时歇斯底里地宣布
hysterically, at the age of 32 proclaimed,

521
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:27,810
"吉莱斯医生  我破处了"
"Dr. Gillespie, I'm no longer a virgin!"

522
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,010
他在这  我们能碰上他
He's in here. I think we'll catch him.

523
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,430
好吧
All right.

524
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:48,150
我就直接走上前打招呼吗
So, I just go over and say hello?

525
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,990
我说是我邀请你来的  耶鲁的同学
I told him I invited you and we went to Yale together.

526
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,260
这是我的告别派对  他能怎么做
It's my farewell party. What's he gonna do?

527
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,890
走吧
Let's go.

528
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,930
市长先生想叫你们滚蛋
His Honor would like you to get lost.

529
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:01,370
这是我朋友  奈德·威克斯
This is my friend, Ned Weeks.

530
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:02,400
我们知道他是谁
Yeah, we know who he is.

531
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:06,120
市长先生  我们需要你的帮助
Mr. Mayor! We need your help!

532
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,550
现在有一种新型疾病  你一定有所耳闻
There's this new disease. You must have heard about it.

533
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,260
我们迫切需要你的帮助  放手  蠢猪
We need your help badly! Get off me, you pigs!

534
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,600
这里是美国
This is America!

535
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,540
市长先生  我们在垂死挣扎
Mr. Mayor! We're dying!

536
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:21,850
这是奈德写给我们要寄出去的
Okay, this is what Ned wrote for us to send out.

537
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:25,080
"我受够了整天絮叨我们不要放纵
"I am sick of guys moaning that giving up careless sex..."

538
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,370
小心丢了性命的人
"...until this blows over is worse than death.

539
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:30,280
我受够了只关心自己下半身的人
I am sick of guys that can only think with their cocks.

540
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,960
我受够了不肯出柜的同志
I am sick of closeted gays.

541
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:33,780
都1982年了  同志们
It's 1982 now, guys,

542
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,960
你什么时候出柜  你能活到1983年吗"
when are you gonna come out? By 1983 you could be dead."

543
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,180
你疯了
You're crazy.

544
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,840
是吗  布鲁斯  你真这么觉得
Am I, Bruce? Do you really think so?

545
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,920
-我们今晚不是要选出主席吗  -是的
- Aren't we supposed to elect a president tonight? - Yes.

546
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:47,660
别人的生活我们无权干预  奈德
We can't tell people how to live their lives, Ned.

547
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:50,840
同志的政治就是做爱
The entire gay political movement is fucking.

548
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,980
其实呢  我想给病人们
You know, I'm very interested in

549
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:54,920
提供一些特殊服务
starting up some sort of services for the patients.

550
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,590
我们一定得谈谈这个
We've gotta start talking about them.

551
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,270
外面还有很多人惊慌失措
Also, there are a lot of very scared people out there

552
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:00,850
急切地想要更多信息
and they're desperate for information.

553
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,970
我想建立热线电话
I'd like to start a hotline.

554
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,200
他是谁
Who's he?

555
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:06,520
他还不知道我是谁
He does not know who I am yet.

556
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,540
他叫汤米·博特莱特
His name is Tommy Boatwright.

557
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:11,340
日常生活中  他是医院院务主任
In real life, he is a hospital administrator.

558
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:14,150
他是来帮忙的  还是个南方的浪荡帅哥
Uh... he's here to help and he's a Southern bitch.

559
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:16,200
博特莱特先生  布鲁斯·耐尔斯
Mr. Boatwright, Bruce Niles.

560
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,610
-很高兴认识你  -我的荣幸
- Nice to meet you. - My pleasure.

561
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:18,610
你可真帅
You're very handsome.

562
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:19,750
-他清楚得很  -确实很帅
- He knows.  - Yes, well he is.

563
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,130
这是什么鬼
The fuck is this?

564
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,030
这是你的主意吗  奈德
Was this your idea, Ned?

565
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,460
我在看  哪里有问题吗
I'm looking. What am I not seeing?

566
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,780
-仔细看  -寄信人地址是怎么写的
- Keep looking. - What we put for our return address.

567
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,930
你是指信封上有"同志"这个词吗
Do you mean because the word "Gay" is on the envelope?

568
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:36,630
完全正确  不写名字只写同志
Fucking A, yes. Instead of just our initials.

569
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,760
-不能寄出去  -拜托
- We can't send these out. - Excuse me.

570
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,450
要是还想有人来参加舞会
If we want anybody to show up for this dance,

571
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:41,990
今晚必须把这些信寄出去
we have to get these out tonight.

572
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:42,560
我们得全部检查一边
We need to go through and

573
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,190
用马克笔把"同志"这个词划去
scratch out the word "Gay" With a Magic Marker.

574
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,780
亲爱的  要划上一万次吗
Oh, honey, 10,000 times?

575
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,900
布鲁斯  如果是寄给跟父母一起
Bruce, I have sympathy for kids living at home

576
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,620
住在长岛的人是有些麻烦
on Long Island with their parents, but--

577
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:52,860
但我们的收信人  比如你
but the guys who are getting these... look at you.

578
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,410
你独居在家  有自己的公寓
You live at home-- you live alone, you own your own apartment,

579
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:56,770
你妈妈住在另一个州
your mother lives in another state.

580
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:58,310
那我的邮递员呢
Okay, what about my mailman?

581
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,910
你不是认真的吧
You don't expect me to take you seriously.

582
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:03,030
-我很认真  奈德  -姑娘们注意言辞  
- Yes, I do, Ned. - Okay, ladies, behave.

583
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:06,700
已经很晚了  我们还没选出主席
Look, it's getting late and we still haven't elected a president.

584
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,680
奈德
Neddy...

585
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,390
我觉得应该选布鲁斯
I think that it should be Bruce.

586
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,700
大家都认识他  喜欢他  所有人...
Everybody knows him everybody likes him - and everybody--

587
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,740
因为他更受欢迎  而大家都怕我吗
'Cause he's popular and everybody's afraid of me?

588
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,700
没错
Yes!

589
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,960
瞧瞧他  他光彩照人
I mean, look at him. He's-- he's gorgeous

590
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,750
住在克里斯多福街和法尔岛的同志们
and all the kids in Christopher Street and Fire Island,

591
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,660
他们会更心甘情愿地
they'll just-- they'll feel  a little bit more comfortable

592
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,620
追随他
following him.

593
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,640
-就像高中时那样  -没错
- Just like high school. - Yes!

594
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,870
赞成布鲁斯·耐尔斯
All right, all those in favor of Bruce Niles

595
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:29,860
担任首届主席的人请举手
as our first president, raise their hands.

596
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,530
我还没想好当不当
I don't think I want this.

597
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:37,230
得了吧  你那么帅  谁不愿意跟你呢
Oh, come on. You're gorgeous and we're all gonna follow you.

598
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:42,430
-操你  我干了  -操你  恭喜
- Fuck you, I accept. - Well, fuck you, congratulations.

599
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:12,120
菲利克斯  我们搬去远方吧
Felix... let's move somewhere far away,

600
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,910
只有你我  一起待在荒岛上
just the two of us, together on a desert island.

601
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:17,670
你正在做的事情可一分一秒都不能停
Don't you dare stop for one single second what you're doing.

602
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,240
《纽约时报》不作为
I appreciate you not yelling at me

603
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,100
我也没有更积极地参与
about what the "Times" isn't doing

604
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,090
很感谢你没对我发脾气
and my not being more political.

605
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:26,960
你怎么不生气呢
Why don't you? 

606
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:30,190
能有个人只讲雪月  不谈政治  也是种放松
It's a relief not having to have to talk politics with someone, 

607
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,340
但不是因为这个
but that's not the reason.

608
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,120
不是吗
No?

609
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,270
因为你太美好了
It's because you're too good to be true,

610
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:39,580
我等你等了这么久
because I've been waiting for a lover like you my whole life,

611
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,160
才能跟你在一起
you haven't showed up until now,

612
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,340
我害怕得不得了
and I'm scared shitless

613
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,280
生怕自己搞砸了
that I'm gonna do something to fuck it up.

614
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:46,610
-我疯了吗  -当然
- Am I crazy? - Of course.

615
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:49,680
我就喜欢这样
That's why I'm here.

616
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,480
终于暖和起来了
Now we gettin' warm.

617
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,690
我看起来还好吗
Did I look okay?

618
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:00,800
能看出来我是用化妆品在遮吗
Could you tell I was wearing all this makeup?

619
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:03,020
你看起来很好
You looked great.

620
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,270
你得去见见艾玛
You have got to go see Emma.

621
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:09,050
能别提这档子事吗
Can we just forget about this?

622
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:11,240
我很好
I'm all right.

623
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:14,220
就算不好我也宁可自欺欺人  否则没人会雇我
And if I'm not, I don't wanna know because no one will hire me,

624
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,420
如果我丢掉了工作  就只能等死了
and if I can't work, I'd just as soon be dead.

625
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,590
我的体重没有降低
I haven't lost any weight.

626
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,950
我还能遮住
I can still cover it up.

627
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,670
-我说了别告诉他  -对不起
- I told you not to tell him. - Sorry.

628
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,380
已经害怕亲吻我了吗
Already afraid to kiss me?

629
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,540
不是这样的
That's not true.

630
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:45,690
没关系  我也不敢让你吻我
It's okay. I'm afraid to let you.

631
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,970
我爱你
I love you.

632
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:10,000
我送他下楼
I'll walk him down.

633
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,570
他是我的第三个伴侣
Okay, he's the third guy I've been with.

634
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,460
莱因哈特  克雷格  如果艾伯特得病
Reinhardt, Craig, and I don't know what I'll do

635
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:26,620
我真不知道怎么办
if Albert has this.

636
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,750
你得去战斗
You're gonna fight.

637
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,090
我们要一起战斗
We'll fight together.

638
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,410
你是我最好的朋友  奈德·威克斯
You're my best friend, Ned Weeks.

639
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:38,600
你是我最好的朋友  我从未遇见过你这样的人
You're my best friend and I've never met anyone like you before.

640
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,290
什么叫我这样的人
What do you mean, like me?

641
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:41,800
你这样  就是说...
Like you, meaning...

642
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:46,220
我出生长大的地方
where I'm from, I-- I mean--

643
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:49,010
我参军前  都没见过犹太人
I didn't even see a Jew until I was in the Army,

644
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:51,940
更别说这样一个
let alone a man that was

645
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:55,630
机智  风趣
smart, funny...

646
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,810
外表出众的男人
decently good-looking.

647
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,860
我的朋友都不跟我出去玩
My friends stopped hanging out with me

648
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:09,000
因为他们说我让他们感到压抑
because they say I depress them.

649
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:12,120
压抑就压抑吧
So be it.

650
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,760
而你...
And you...

651
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:23,550
你看起来不像那种犹太人
you don't look that Jewish.

652
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:24,410
你看起来也不像同性恋
Well, you don't look gay,

653
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:26,810
不过我们总归还都是白人
so I guess we can both pass for white people.

654
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:36,930
我爱艾伯特
I love Albert.

655
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:40,240
布鲁斯  看着我
Bruce, look at me.

656
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,660
我爱他
I love him.

657
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,080
艾伯特会挺过去的
Albert's gonna make it.

658
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,350
如果不能呢
What if he doesn't?

659
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:55,300
我送你回家吧
Let's get you home.

660
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:11,960
-我真是一团糟  -是啊
- I'm a mess. - Yeah.

661
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,770
真是优雅
Classy moment.

662
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,660
-我没事  -好
- I'm all right. - Okay.

663
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:05,990
我一直想在浴房抱着你
When I finally get you where I want you,

664
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:07,370
现在得偿所愿了
I don't want you anymore.

665
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:12,190
布鲁斯  我也陷入爱河了
Hey, Bruce, I'm in love too.

666
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,140
我操
Holy shit!

667
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,210
全是同志啊
Queen control.

668
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,300
希望梦想成真时  就真的实现了
Really works when it wants to.

669
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,670
菲利克斯  这是迪克·隆巴 
Oh, hey, Felix. This is Dick Lombardo.

670
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:47,080
-你好  -终于来了一位
- Hi. - Finally got us someone on our board

671
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,540
会跳迪斯科的董事了
who isn't a disco dummy.

672
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:51,420
就今晚会跳
Well... maybe tonight.

673
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,410
-一会见  -很高兴见到你
- I'll see ya. - Nice to meet ya.

674
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:53,380
走吧
Come on.

675
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:40,600
很高兴今晚各位的加入
We are all so happy you joined us tonight!

676
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,940
我们证明了我们不止有外表
We are proving that we are more than just looks, 

677
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:46,840
头脑  天赋和内心情感
brains, talent and heart.

678
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:49,440
我们比城里任何男同组织  
Together we raised more than 

679
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,050
筹集的资金都要多
any gay group ever in this city.

680
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:58,380
我想为大家介绍奈德·威克斯先生
And I wanna call over Mr. Ned Weeks.

681
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,870
别害羞
Don't be shy.

682
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:10,240
我们做到了
We did it!

683
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:13,640
现在来揭晓  我们一共筹集了多少钱
We will now reveal just how much we raised together.

684
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:16,340
倒数  三  二  一
In three, two, one...

685
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:19,500
53,000美元
$53,000!

686
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:38,090
男同健康危机组织的成员  快上台
Gay Men's Health Crisis, come on up.

687
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,030
菲利克斯  亲爱的  上台来  快上来
Felix, honey, come on up, please. Come up.

688
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,090
我爱你
I love you.

689
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,270
舞动起来
Let's dance!

690
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:19,110
某天他将到来
Someday he'll come along

691
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:22,600
那个我爱的男人
The man I love

692
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:26,350
他强壮又高大
And he'll be big and strong

693
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:29,710
那个我爱的男人
The man I love

694
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,970
当他向我走来
And when he comes my way

695
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:36,450
我会尽我所能
I'll do my best

696
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:43,800
让他留下
To make him stay

697
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:49,330
他注视着我  朝我微笑
He'll look at me and smile

698
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:52,280
我就心领神会
I'll understand

699
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:55,870
不久之后
And in a little while

700
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,190
他会牵起我的手
He'll take my hand

701
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:03,550
尽管看似荒诞
And though it seems absurd

702
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:12,800
彼此相视无语
I know we both won't say a word

703
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:19,430
或许我会在周日遇见他
Maybe I shall meet him in Sunday

704
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:23,300
或许是周一
Maybe Monday

705
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:28,000
又或许无法遇见
Maybe not

706
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:31,880
我仍然相信我会遇见他
Still I'm sure to meet him one day

707
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:38,150
{\an9}或许周二
Maybe Tuesday 

708
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:45,560
{\an9}是我的幸运日
Will be my good news day

709
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,310
想象一下如果我们年轻时  拥有此刻的场景
Imagine if we had this when we were young.

710
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:37,200
无畏无惧  无所遗憾
No fear, no shame.

711
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,580
这些年我的梦里都是你
All I was imagining all those years was you.

712
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:51,140
他会建起一个小家
He'll build a little home

713
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:54,230
只为两人存在
Just meant for two

714
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:58,140
从此我不再流浪
From which I'd never roam

715
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:01,420
他会是谁  是你吗
Who would, would you

716
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:06,010
以上的一切
And so all else above

717
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:15,230
{\an9]只为等待着我爱的男人}I'm waiting for the man I love

718
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:12,900
菲利克斯·特纳  跟我一起生活好吗
Felix Turner, would you like to move in with me?

719
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:14,160
好
Yes.

720
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:16,040
好
Yes?

721
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,150
-好吗  -好
- Yes? - Yes!

722
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:18,890
太好了
Yes! Yes! 

723
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:23,700
无论何时
And so all else above...

724
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:32,950
我都在等着我爱的
I'm waiting for the man

725
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:39,450
男人
I love

726
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:49,010
"这就像身上的定时炸弹
"We are all walking time bombs

727
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:51,550
不知道什么时候会爆炸"
waiting for whatever it is to set us off."

728
00:48:58,260 --> 00:48:59,010
撑住  我们快到了
C'mon, we're almost there.

729
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:01,450
"若这篇文章不能使你们警觉
"If this article doesn't scare the shit out of you,

730
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:04,140
地球以后将不会再有同志的身影
gay men may have no future here on Earth.

731
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:08,190
我们能否继续生存就看你们有多愤怒"
Our continued existence depends on just how angry you can get."

732
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,980
-四个急诊室都不肯收我们  -进来
- They turned us away from four emergency rooms. - Come in!

733
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,680
我觉得他失去意识了
I think he's lost his mind.

734
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,480
奈德  我能带他去哪
Ned, where can I take him?

735
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,170
把他放在沙发上  我找艾玛
Put him on the couch there. I'll call Emma.

736
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:20,440
-该死的  -我弄点水
- God damn it! - I'll get some water.

737
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,280
他这样多久了
How long has he been like this?

738
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,310
几个小时了
A couple hours.

739
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,570
我很高兴你问我这个问题
Well, I'm glad you asked me that question.

740
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:33,530
我怎么看  我知道政府
What do I think? I know that the government

741
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:36,480
有意忽视这个传染病
is intentionally ignoring this epidemic.

742
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,040
你在指责美国政府
You're accusing the government of the United States

743
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:43,750
蓄意谋杀所有同志吗
of a conspiracy to murder all gay men?

744
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,250
是的  就是这么回事
Yes. Yes, you can say that.

745
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:53,470
是  萨拉伯斯  我是
Yes, Sarabeth, I am. Yes.

746
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:56,310
这是很严重的指责
That is a powerful accusation.

747
00:49:56,310 --> 00:49:58,750
这是传染病  而美国政府
This is an epidemic and it's being ignored

748
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:00,150
却忽视了它
by the United States government.

749
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:02,470
-有意的吗  -有意忽视
- Intentionally? - Intentionally being ignored.

750
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:04,280
这是全国范围的危机
This is a national emergency.

751
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:06,180
这是传染病  是瘟疫
This is an epidemic. It's a plague.

752
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:07,660
你不能在国家电视台
You can't go on national TV 

753
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:09,210
指责政府谋杀  奈德
and accuse the government of murder, Ned.

754
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:09,980
为什么不能
Why not? 

755
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:13,200
因为要靠他们拨款  批准科研项目
Because one day we're gonna get money, research grants.

756
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,440
国会尚未拨出一分钱
Congress still hasn't appropriated a dime.

757
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,860
市长还在说啊说
The mayor's still... on and on!

758
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,220
奈德  对外
Ned, when you go public,

759
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:20,520
你没有权利代表组织说话
you have no right to speak for this organization

760
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:23,460
除非事先得到我们的同意
unless we have approved what you have to say in advance.

761
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:25,150
说到这  其实呢
You know, in point of fact,

762
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:26,980
你都不属于这个组织
you aren't even an officer of this organization

763
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:29,650
你根本不该代表我们说话
and you shouldn't be speaking for us at all.

764
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:32,480
感谢你告诉我这个  迪克
Well, thank you for sharing that with me, Dick.

765
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:47,440
你为什么觉得面对这次危机
Why do you think the city has been so slow

766
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,910
纽约迟迟不肯接受和应对
to acknowledge and deal with this emergency?

767
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:53,200
你这么说  好像纽约已经意识到了
Well, you're implying that the city has recognized

768
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,240
可是马尔科姆  不是这样
and acknowledged this emergency, Malcolm. It has not.

769
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:56,510
你为什么认为没有
Why not, do you think?

770
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,070
因为市长是同志  他已经
Because the mayor's gay and he's scared shitless

771
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:01,420
吓得屁滚尿流  怕自己暴露
out of his panties it'll blow his cover.

772
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,130
-怎么了  -关掉  关掉
- What? - Take it off, get it off.

773
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:04,470
我们还录吗
Are we still rolling?

774
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,850
我在表达自己的看法  你别插嘴
You can't tell me what to say when I'm speaking for myself.

775
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:09,170
扯淡  他们都知道你是我们的一员
Bullshit. They all know you're one of us.

776
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:10,800
把自认为不是同志的人
It is totally and politically incorrect

777
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,560
称作同志  是政治不正确的
to call someone gay who does not self-identify as being gay.

778
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:14,820
我当然明白这点
I know it's been that way forever,

779
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:17,770
可是现在情况不一样  我们快死了
but something different is going on here now. We're dying.

780
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:19,690
市长是你的私人朋友
The mayor, he's a personal friend of yours.

781
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:21,290
你要他委派给你法官
You want him to appoint you a judge.

782
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:23,200
跟这里的事有利益冲突吗
Do you have a little conflict of interest going on here?

783
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,020
-我说了  我给他留了便条  -什么时候
- I told you I sent him a memo. - When?

784
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:26,100
-通过某些渠道  -什么时候
- Through channels. - When?

785
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,820
-他会回复我的  -什么时候
- He'll answer me. - When?!

786
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:31,010
这个月发生了110宗病例
There's 110 new cases this month!

787
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:33,160
还是没见到我们的同志市长
Still no meeting with our gay mayor.

788
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,160
没见到他的同志助手
No meeting with his gay assistant.

789
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:40,340
怎么了  布鲁斯  我让你尴尬了吗
What? Do I embarrass you, Bruce?

790
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:43,000
是的  没错
Yes. You do.

791
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,890
宝贝  以善待人结果总会好一点
You get more with honey than with vinegar, babe.

792
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:46,540
汤米  还真没人跟我说过呢
God, no one's told me that one, Tommy.

793
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:48,510
可不是吗
No, obviously, they haven't.

794
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:49,930
反正我不信
I never believed that bullshit, anyway.

795
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:51,820
我们一直在想办法帮助病患
We are in over our heads with the patients we're trying to help.

796
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:55,370
汤米  你能不能大声念出这份报告给奈德听
Tommy, will you please read this report out loud for Ned?

797
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:58,700
我们已经训练了25位危机顾问
We have trained 25 crisis counselors

798
00:51:58,700 --> 00:51:59,970
去帮助最新确诊的患者
to help the newly diagnosed

799
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:02,350
满足他们的所有需求
in whatever needs that they might have.

800
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:05,410
我们有12个组长每周至少与顾问见面一次
We have 12 group leaders who meet with these counselors

801
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:07,780
来查看他们所照顾的病人的情况
at least once a week to go over their clients.

802
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:09,820
有17个心理学家和/或精神病学家
There are now 17 volunteer social workers,

803
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:11,980
作为志愿社工
psychologists and/or psychiatrists.

804
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:14,120
我们帮助起草了75份遗嘱...
We helped draw up 75 wills last--

805
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,410
75份  布鲁斯
75, Bruce!

806
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:18,080
你以前可是斗士
You used to be a fighter once.

807
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:21,250
-你喜欢待在特种部队里面吗  -我喜欢
- Did you like being in the Green Berets? - Yes. I loved it.

808
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:23,310
你已经不会抗争了吗
Have you completely forgotten how to fight?

809
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:25,410
轮不到你教我  咱俩方式不同而已
Don't tell me how to fight. I just fight differently than you.

810
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:27,580
-你哪里抗争了  -没有吗
- I haven't seen your way yet. - No?

811
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:30,440
布鲁斯  艾伯特可能要死了
Bruce... Albert may be dying.

812
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:33,510
你个王八蛋  不许拿他说事儿
You son of a bitch! You say another word about him!

813
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:34,740
放轻松
Relax.

814
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:36,920
还有你
And you.

815
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:40,530
你没资格在这里
You have no right being on this board

816
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:42,840
除非你给你的市长朋友施压
unless you put pressure on your friend the mayor.

817
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:43,430
我们一开始让你来
That's why I asked you to

818
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:45,770
就是为了这个  你心里清楚
join us in the first place and you know it.

819
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,190
-不  我不做  -为什么
- No, no, I'm not gonna do that. - Why not?

820
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:01,190
不行  我的律师所免费给你提供法律支持
No, you got your free legal work from my firm.

821
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:02,660
我不要加入你们
I'm not gonna be on your board of directors.

822
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:05,510
只是为了面上好看  你什么都不用做
It's only for the stationery. You don't have to do a thing.

823
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:06,950
你在找托词
That is just an evasion. 

824
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:08,410
如果你把它想成是直男的病
If you thought this was a straight disease-- -

825
00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:09,770
不  这跟你是同性恋没关系
Nah, it's got nothing to do with you being gay.

826
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:11,750
那跟什么有关系
What else does it have to do with?

827
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,200
总有一天  我会让你同意
One of these days, I'm gonna get you to agree

828
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,810
这个国家里超过两千万的男女
that over 20 million men and women in this country

829
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:18,280
不需要接受心理治疗
don't require the services of a psychiatrist.

830
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,040
我在试着理解
Look, try to understand.

831
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,830
我会看文章  看电视
You know, I read stuff, I see TV.

832
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:23,820
紧身衣  链条
Guys in leather and chains.

833
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:25,710
裙子  高跟鞋
Dresses, high heels.

834
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:27,440
我对自己说"这不是奈德"
I say to myself, "This isn't Ned."

835
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,220
媒体就爱这么夸张
You know the media always dramatizes the most extreme.

836
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:32,400
你们的形象太糟了
You guys have a dreadful image problem.

837
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:33,430
所以我们需要你
That's why it's so important

838
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:35,350
来支持我们
to have people like you supporting us.

839
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:36,930
你多体面啊
You already have your dignity.

840
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:39,640
我们得赶快去吃午饭了  还有个重要的会
We better get to lunch. I've got an important meeting.

841
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,410
是吗  有多重要
Do you? How important?

842
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,360
我在请求你的支持
I'm asking for your support.

843
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:46,870
所有我认为重要的方面  我都支持你
In every area I consider important, you have my support.

844
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:48,970
我只觉得一件事重要
The only area that I consider important

845
00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:51,070
你却没支持我
I don't have your support at all.

846
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:53,920
在你的内心深处
In some place deep down inside you,

847
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,550
你还是觉得我病了  对吧
you still think I'm sick, don't you?

848
00:53:55,550 --> 00:53:57,330
我觉得你过得还不错
I think you've adjusted to life pretty well.

849
00:53:57,330 --> 00:54:00,710
-整体来看而已  -我以前看到了你有多不幸福
- All things considered. - I saw how unhappy you were.

850
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:01,800
你也一样
So were you!

851
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:05,930
你也去看心理医生了  我们从小一起长大
You wound up going to shrinks, too. We grew up side by side.

852
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,670
我们对爸爸妈妈一样有意见
We both felt the same about Mom and Pop.

853
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:10,110
我同意
I'll agree to the fact that

854
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:13,060
我是有很多性格缺陷
I have any number of awful character traits,

855
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:16,880
但我绝不同意是他们俩的所作所为
but not to the fact that whatever awful things they did to us

856
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,650
把我变成了病态的同志  却把你变成了健康的直男
made me sick and gay while you stayed straight and healthy.

857
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:23,100
我们对事情的反应不尽相同
We don't all react the same way to the thing.

858
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:25,420
所以你当了律师  我成了作家
So you became a lawyer and I became a writer.

859
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:27,510
这只是看世界的方式不同
Well, we have a difference of opinion over theory.

860
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:29,930
但在你的眼里我是个异类
But your theory turns me into a man from Mars.

861
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:32,010
我可没这样看你
My theory doesn't do that to you.

862
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:34,480
你是想说  那么早送你去看心理医生
Are you suggesting I did something wrong

863
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,700
是我的错吗
in sending you into therapy so young?

864
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:38,750
我又不知道你要看多久的医生
I didn't know you were gonna stay there forever.

865
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:40,200
在你把我送去之前  我没觉得
I didn't think that I'd had done anything wrong

866
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,910
自己做错了什么
until you sent me there.

867
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:46,320
本  在这世上你在我心里分量最重
Ben... you mean more to me than anyone in the whole world.

868
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:49,980
-一直如此  本  你必须得说出来  -说什么
- You always have. Ben, you gotta say it. - Say what?

869
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:53,430
我跟你一样  说出来  说出来啊
I'm the same as you. Just say it. Say it!

870
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,170
不
No.

871
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:04,670
你不是
You're not.

872
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,300
我说不出来
I'm not gonna say it.

873
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,430
每次跟你在这个话题上吵输  我都更受伤
Every time I lose this fight, it hurts more.

874
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,660
-我要回家了  -别这样  
- I'm going home. - Oh, come on, Lemon.

875
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:17,900
我还是爱你的
I still love you.

876
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:19,470
萨拉还是爱你的
Sarah still loves you.

877
00:55:19,470 --> 00:55:22,090
-猫也还是爱你的  -这不是玩笑
- The cat still loves you. - This is not a joke.

878
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:25,200
我爱你  给你提供法律咨询
You have my love, my legal advice,

879
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:25,930
还让你帮我理财
my financial supervision.

880
00:55:25,930 --> 00:55:27,900
我不能给你反抗我的勇气
I can't give you the courage to stand up to me

881
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,580
让你觉得可以对我的想法不屑一顾
and say you don't give a flying fuck about what I think.

882
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:34,740
每个人都多少受到别人的压制
Everybody's oppressed by somebody else in some form or another.

883
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,400
大部分人都知道要奋起反抗
Most of us learn to fight against it

884
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,170
不要在乎别人的眼光  不寻求帮助
despite people's opinions without the help of others.

885
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:44,200
别再想利用愧疚获得我赞同
And stop trying to wring some kind of admission of guilt out of me.

886
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:47,220
接受你我生来相同的事实
Agreeing that you were born just the same as I was born

887
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,780
是不会拯救你垂死的伙伴的
isn't gonna save your dying friends.

888
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:52,480
正是这一点  能救我垂死的伙伴们
That is exactly what is going to save my dying friends.

889
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,150
你说得好像我是敌人一般
You make it sound like I'm the enemy. 

890
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:55,050
我不由得觉得
I am beginning to think

891
00:55:55,050 --> 00:55:57,580
你和你的异性恋世界是我们的敌人
that you and your straight world are our enemy.

892
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:59,700
我对你非常气愤
I am furious with you!

893
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:02,750
以及每一个让我觉得爱上同性
And every goddamn doctor who made me feel it

894
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:04,110
是恶心的事的医生
was sick to love a man.

895
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:06,240
我试着去理解
I am trying to understand

896
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:09,990
为什么我们要死了却没人在乎
why nobody gives a shit that we're dying!

897
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:15,870
五百万买栋房子吗  政府连几分钱都不给
$5 million for a house? We can't even get 27 cents from the city.

898
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:18,010
已经有四十三个我认识的人死了
I know 43 guys who have died

899
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:20,420
你却告诉我是我的原因  不是你的吗
and you say it's my cause not yours?

900
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:22,610
你还是觉得我病态
You still think I'm sick!

901
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:27,310
我只是一秒钟都忍受不下去了
I simply cannot allow it for one single second longer.

902
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:32,080
除非你当我和你平等  否则我不会找你
I will not speak to you again until you accept me as your equal!

903
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,020
我们的健康同样重要
Your healthy equal!

904
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:35,580
我是你的弟弟
Your brother!

905
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,760
对  小心点  小伙子们
Yeah, be careful with that, boys.

906
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,270
-那可是件珍贵古董  -慢慢来
- That is a precious antique. - Easy.

907
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,430
我觉得  我们该把它放到大型沙龙去
I'm thinking we should put that in the grand salon.

908
00:56:50,430 --> 00:56:52,360
我们有地下室吗  应该放那儿去才对
Do we have a basement? That's where it should go.

909
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:55,370
贝拉  真该把你的臭嘴好好治治
Bella, I think it's time we moved your filthy mouth above ground.

910
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:56,510
我明天再安排
I'll decorate tomorrow.

911
00:56:56,510 --> 00:56:59,250
都随便扔进去就是了
Just shove it all in there the best you can.

912
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,950
你俩都够了
Okay, knock it off, both of you.

913
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:05,110
打扰了
Excuse me.

914
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:07,930
-你好  -你好
- Yes, hi. - Hi.

915
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:09,560
我叫艾斯特尔
My name is Estelle

916
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:13,790
我最好的朋友哈维昨晚死了
and my best friend Harvey died last night.

917
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:19,350
我们形影不离  知道吗
We went everywhere together, you know?

918
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:24,700
看百老汇的剧  火箭女郎的舞  还一起滑冰
Like Broadway and the Rockettes and ice skating.

919
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:31,490
他滑起来十分优雅  我却笨手笨脚
He was a beautiful skater. I'm a klutz.

920
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:33,480
但他不在乎
But he didn't care.

921
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:36,910
我们曾有过那么多欢乐
We had so much fun.

922
00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:40,770
该死  我想做点什么
Damn it, I wanna do something!

923
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:42,850
尽管所有我的女同朋友都说
Even though all my lesbian friends say,

924
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:44,460
"你们男人为我们又做过什么"
"What have you guys ever done for us?"

925
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:47,000
但我不在乎
But I don't care.

926
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:50,700
我是为了哈维
This is for Harvey.

927
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:55,220
拜托了  告诉我  我能有点用处
Please... tell me you can use me for something.

928
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,890
我需要热线电话接线员  你能胜任吗
I need a hotline director. You think you can do that?

929
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,510
-我不知道怎么做  -我也不知道
- I don't know how. - I don't either.

930
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:16,910
我请你喝杯咖啡吧
Let me buy you a cup of coffee

931
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:19,220
-然后慢慢聊  好吗  -好
- and we'll figure this out, okay? - Okay.

932
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,720
你想设在这里吗
So, you want to set up here? 

933
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,690
对  很好  开始吧
Yeah, this is good. Let's do it.

934
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:36,870
-你在干什么  -我们是NBC下属的
- What are you doing? - We're from the NBC affiliate.

935
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:40,260
-怎样  -这里是新成立的男同健康危机组织吗
- So? - This is the new Gay Men's Health Crisis office.

936
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:41,080
你是谁
Who are you? 

937
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:42,410
我是布鲁斯·奈尔斯  是组织的主席
I'm Bruce Niles. I'm the president.

938
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:43,630
我可从没同意过
I didn't sign any consent form

939
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:45,370
你们拍摄我  或是拍摄这里
for you to film me or this establishment.

940
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:46,530
请关机离开
Please turn it off and leave.

941
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:48,240
别碰我的摄像机
Hey, now, don't touch my camera.

942
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,720
-谁派你们来的  -一个叫奈德的人
- Who sent you here? - Somebody named Ned.

943
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,610
-威克斯  -太好了  你来了
- Weeks. - Oh, great. You're here.

944
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:56,400
-有人是同性恋吗  -操蛋的
- Anybody homo? - Son of a bitch.

945
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,430
你好  这东西在录吗
Hello, is this thing rolling?

946
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:01,450
瞧瞧这个  我们一周内同时登上了这两份杂志
Look at this! We're in both of them the same week.

947
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:03,380
以及所有的主流电视网
Every major network

948
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:06,150
现在终于轮到我们的第一间办公室了
and now finally our very first office.

949
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:09,500
来认识下我们还没出柜的同志主席
I wanna introduce you to our gay president who's in the closet.

950
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,580
他可真帅  你们不觉得吗
And he's so handsome. Don't ya think?

951
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:15,170
白白浪费了这么帅的封面人物
Such a very handsome cover boy going to waste.

952
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:20,040
很好  你终于会抗争了  很好  来啊  布鲁斯
Oh, great. Now you fight. Great! Fight, Bruce.

953
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,480
你说得我像个懦夫  但我不是
You made me sound like a coward and I'm not a coward.

954
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:24,060
知道吗  你没什么可失去的
You know what? You have nothing to lose.

955
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,160
你哥哥为你投资  你有稳定收入
Your brother invests for you so you have income.

956
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:29,140
你可以随便做同性恋  奈德  但我不行
You can be gay 24/7, Ned, but I can't!

957
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:30,730
我不行  所以去你的
I can't! So fuck you!

958
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:32,520
不  去你的  布鲁斯
No, fuck you, Bruce!

959
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:35,270
上帝啊
Oh, oh, oh. Jesus.

960
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,500
一看到你  我就充满了绝望
When I look at you, I am filled with despair.

961
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,060
一看到你  我就担心我们没办法赢
When I look at you, I worry we're not gonna win.

962
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:44,980
你觉得这个国家是怎么建成的
How do you think this country was founded?

963
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:47,300
我还以为我是和保罗·里维尔[爱国志士]一起共事
I thought I was getting started with Paul Revere,

964
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,550
而不是个懦夫
not some coward.

965
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:54,260
奈德  看着我  看着我
Ned, look at me. Look at me!

966
00:59:54,330 --> 00:59:55,260
看着我
Look at me!

967
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,020
按你的方法来  我们都得死
We are doomed if we do it your way.

968
00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:00,910
-都得死  -他们如果不知道我们是谁
- Doomed! - How are they going to help us

969
01:00:00,910 --> 01:00:02,120
怎么会帮助我们
if they don't know who we are?

970
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:04,160
要是知道了就不会帮我们了  奈德
They won't help us, Ned, if they do.

971
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:11,890
你们这群王八
You walking son of b..

972
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:13,760
别这样
Hey, hey, hey! Hey! Come on.

973
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,250
住手  住手
Come on. Come on.

974
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:18,770
-真要命  -该死
- Holy shit. - Shit!

975
01:00:34,810 --> 01:00:36,300
好吧  我来接  当然了
Okay, I'll get it, sure.

976
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:39,340
你好  您是第一个来电的
Hello? Yeah, you are our very first call.

977
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:40,440
有什么需要帮忙的
How can I help you?

978
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:45,100
抱歉  你打错电话了
I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.

979
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:53,820
你们俩都给我控制一点  成吗
You each gotta pull your shit together now, okay?

980
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:58,350
你也别老闹得小题大做  该死的  
And you need to stop being such a fucking drama queen. God damn.

981
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:01,500
这位是埃斯特尔
This is Estelle.

982
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:05,600
你们还好吗
Hey. How's it going?

983
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:07,390
欢迎
Welcome.

984
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:24,410
那时我能感觉到
I could feel at the time

985
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:28,480
一切都不得而知
There was no way of knowing

986
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:31,920
谁知夜晚的落叶
Fallen leaves in the night

987
01:01:32,370 --> 01:01:36,020
将随风飘往何处
Who can say where they're blowing?

988
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:39,950
如清风般自由
As free as the wind

989
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:43,580
希望得以真知
And hopefully learning

990
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:47,690
为何大海之潮
Why the sea on the tide

991
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:51,270
无路可转
Has no way of turning

992
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:56,570
远胜于此
More than this

993
01:01:58,110 --> 01:02:02,250
{\an9}一无所有
There is nothing

994
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:04,360
{\an9}远胜于此
More than this

995
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:01,470
我们两人四手  两份收入
Well, we have four hands and two incomes.

996
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:03,020
再过几年就无福消受了
You're not getting any younger, you know.

997
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:04,890
别拿我的年龄说事
All right, let's leave my age out of this.

998
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:09,570
告诉我一事
Tell me one thing

999
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:11,690
远胜于此
More than this

1000
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:16,780
-乡下真的很美  -乡下真的很安静
- Very beautiful, the country. - Very quiet, the country.

1001
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:21,560
不不  你敢
No, no. Don't you dare!

1002
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:22,500
我必须得接
I have to.

1003
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:26,700
你又没在你的机器那留这个号码
You didn't leave this number on your machine.

1004
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:29,670
-你答应过的  -你好
- You promised. - Hello?

1005
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:32,500
我的确认为我们需要对市长进行抗议
I do think we should picket the mayor.

1006
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:37,320
是的  我说过  我也坚持我的说法  谢谢
Yes, I said that and I stand by that. Thank you.

1007
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:39,670
你答应过的
You promised.

1008
01:02:40,370 --> 01:02:42,490
不不不  等等
No, no, no, no, no. Wait.

1009
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:51,750
"所有不主动站出来的同志
"And every gay man who is unable to come forward

1010
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:53,440
不为自救而抗争的同志
and fight to save his own life

1011
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:55,660
都是在帮助杀害其他的同志"
is truly helping to kill the rest of us."

1012
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:58,230
在你吓得屁滚尿流  并采取行动之前
How many of us have to die before you get scared off your ass

1013
01:02:58,230 --> 01:03:00,020
我们还要死多少人  谢谢
and into action? Thank you.

1014
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:04,160
那是谁
Who was that?

1015
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:08,110
好像是"奈德·威克斯教你发脾气"
I hear it's being called the "Ned Weeks School of Outrage."

1016
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:13,370
我跟我们的一个科学记者提起过
I did speak to one of our science reporters.

1017
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:14,590
他怎么说的
What did he say?

1018
01:03:14,930 --> 01:03:16,940
结果他也是同志  他不愿意...
It turns out he's gay and he won't...

1019
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:19,860
别对我喊
Don't yell at me.

1020
01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:25,000
那些精神病医生  他们肯定做对了什么
All those shrinks, they must have done something right.

1021
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,140
瑞塔沃医生
Dr. Ritvo,

1022
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,300
-梅洛夫医生  -梅洛夫
- Dr. Malev, - Malev.

1023
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:31,950
吉莱斯皮医生
Dr. Gillespie,

1024
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:34,010
帕蒂医生
Dr. Patty,

1025
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:36,570
马克辛医生  拉维恩医生
Dr. Maxene, Dr. LaVerne.

1026
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:40,630
为什么要用这么长时间
Why does that have to take so long?

1027
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:42,680
你一直在吃甜食
All you ever eat is desserts.

1028
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:44,790
糖分是生命中最重要的东西
Sugar's the most important thing in life.

1029
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:46,360
其他的只是维持生命而已
All the rest is just to stay alive.

1030
01:03:56,790 --> 01:03:57,730
该死
Shit.

1031
01:03:58,070 --> 01:04:00,120
-怎么了  -该死的董事会
- What? - The fucking board.

1032
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:01,420
他们说我在引起恐慌
They say I'm causing a panic, 

1033
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:03,070
我是在炒作自己
that I'm making myself a celebrity.

1034
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:05,500
他们都不愿意出现在镜头前
Not one of them will be interviewed or appear on TV,

1035
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,940
于是我就自己上
so I do it all by default.

1036
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:09,360
而你在逐渐成为领袖
And you're becoming a leader.

1037
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:12,500
-你喜欢抗争  -我喜欢抗争  我吗
- And you love to fight. - I like to fight? Moi?

1038
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:13,680
你  对啊
Who, you? Yeah.

1039
01:04:14,570 --> 01:04:15,890
你也非常尽兴
And you're havin' a great time.

1040
01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:17,630
的确
I am.

1041
01:04:20,210 --> 01:04:22,200
真可笑  我从没想做领袖
It's funny, I never wanted to be a leader.

1042
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,410
我做得不好
I'm not doing very well.

1043
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:27,400
真可惜我们浪费了这么多时间
It's sad how much time we lost.

1044
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:28,830
我们当时还没准备好而已
We just weren't ready then.

1045
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:37,990
如果我得病了
If I had it...

1046
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:40,290
你会离开我吗
would you leave me?

1047
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:44,820
我不知道
I don't know.

1048
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,390
如果我得病了  你会吗
Would you if I did?

1049
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:51,440
不会
No.

1050
01:04:53,110 --> 01:04:54,140
你怎么知道
How do you know?

1051
01:04:54,650 --> 01:04:57,330
因为我妈分管红十字会地方分会
Because my mother ran the local chapter of the Red Cross.

1052
01:04:57,330 --> 01:05:00,460
我八岁时就被她抓去巡回采血车上干活
She put me to work in the Bloodmobile when I was eight.

1053
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:03,740
我就会照顾别人
I'm not programmed for anything else.

1054
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:08,130
奈德  我有事要跟你说
Ned, I have something to tell you.

1055
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:11,440
你终于有宝宝了
You're finally pregnant.

1056
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:17,060
我结过一次婚
I was married once.

1057
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:22,950
你以前从没说过
You never told me that.

1058
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:23,800
是的  我...
Yeah, I...

1059
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,980
她说我对她不公平
she said I had been unfair to her,

1060
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:29,260
事实也的确如此
which I had been.

1061
01:05:32,190 --> 01:05:34,620
-我有个儿子  -你有个儿子
- I have a son. - You have a son.

1062
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:38,200
-她不让我见他  -你不能见自己的儿子
- She won't let me see him. - You can't see your own son?

1063
01:05:39,050 --> 01:05:40,420
你没抗争吗
But didn't you fight?

1064
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:43,000
就是说你很羞愧
That means you're ashamed.

1065
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,370
他将来也会的
So he will be, too.

1066
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:48,170
所以我之前才没告诉你  谁说我没抗争了
This is why I didn't tell you. Who says I didn't fight?

1067
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:49,340
奈德
Ned?

1068
01:05:49,730 --> 01:05:50,900
那些不像你期望的
What happens to people who

1069
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:52,700
那么坚强的人怎么办
can't be as strong as you want them to be?

1070
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:54,620
我很怕软弱
Weakness scares the shit out of me!

1071
01:05:55,090 --> 01:05:58,130
我父亲很软弱  我怕我会跟他一样
My father was weak, and I'm afraid I'll be like him.

1072
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:00,800
他一辈子都没有为什么去抗争过  就这么去了
His life didn't stand for anything and then it was over.

1073
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:03,300
所以我不断抗争
So I fight, constantly.

1074
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:04,950
既然我能做到  我就不明白了
And if I can do it, I can't understand

1075
01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:07,060
为什么其他人做不到呢
why everybody else can't do it, too, okay?

1076
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:08,810
等等  你要去哪
Wait, where are you going?

1077
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:10,640
菲利克斯  你上哪去
Felix! Where you going?

1078
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:18,360
菲利克斯  那些话不是有心的  菲利克斯
Felix. I didn't mean anything by that, Felix.

1079
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,910
我  很多事我都害怕
I... I... I'm scared of... lots of things.

1080
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:24,250
真的  恐高  我从没告诉过你我怕...
Really. Heights. I never told you I'm terrified of...

1081
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:25,590
怎么了
What?

1082
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:43,870
这东西越来越大
It keeps getting bigger and bigger.

1083
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:46,110
就是不消失
It doesn't go away.

1084
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:00,280
菲利克斯
Felix?

1085
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:06,360
容我问一句  谁是菲利克斯
Who, may I ask, is Felix?

1086
01:07:07,230 --> 01:07:09,290
我这辈子还没这么爱过谁
I've never been so in love in my life.

1087
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:12,650
我就没爱过人
Never been in love in my life.

1088
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:17,470
让他明天一早七点半来找我
Tell him to come to see me first thing tomorrow 7:30.

1089
01:07:18,930 --> 01:07:20,230
奈德  真该死
Ned, God damn it.

1090
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:22,590
我们该怎么办  从此孤独终老吗
What are we supposed to do? Not be with anybody ever?

1091
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:25,280
可没你想得那么轻松
It's not as easy as you might think.

1092
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:28,020
艾玛  对不起
Oh, Em, I'm sorry.

1093
01:07:28,290 --> 01:07:29,230
不用
Don't be.

1094
01:07:32,110 --> 01:07:33,270
你怎么会瘫痪的
How'd you get it?

1095
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:35,430
我当年五岁
I was five years old.

1096
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:38,640
一个巴哈马的女人来了我们镇上
A woman from the Bahamas came to our town

1097
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:39,930
她有脊髓灰质炎病毒
carrying the polio virus.

1098
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:43,380
她  跟朋友们住一起
She... stayed with friends.

1099
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:45,400
他们的孩子跟我一起上幼儿园
Their kid was in my kindergarten class.

1100
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,930
有四个孩子得了小儿麻痹症
Four of us in that class got polio.

1101
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:53,570
我都穿好万圣节服装
I was all dressed up in my Halloween costume

1102
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:54,580
准备去不给糖就捣蛋了
to go trick-or-treating

1103
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:58,070
我妈妈摸了摸我的额头  让我去睡觉
and my mother felt my forehead, put me to bed.

1104
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:02,620
那晚半夜  我感到整个身体都麻痹了
In the middle of the night, I realized my whole body

1105
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:05,520
除了双臂还能动
except my arms and my hands were paralyzed.

1106
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,020
我哭喊着叫妈妈
I was crying out for my mother.

1107
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,680
"我动不了了  我动不了"
"I can't move, I can't move."

1108
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,290
他们连忙送我就医
They rushed me to the hospital,

1109
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:15,940
医生说我撑不过一天
were told I'd be dead in 24 hours.

1110
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:17,580
我抗争了  活了下来
I fought. I lived.

1111
01:08:17,710 --> 01:08:19,110
你上人工呼吸机了吗
Were you in an iron lung?

1112
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:21,110
上了
I was.

1113
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,310
然后回家休养
Then I was in bed at home.

1114
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:28,960
我用一个小小的喇叭
I was connected to my class with this little...

1115
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,450
跟班里的同学说话
little loudspeaker.

1116
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:36,440
老师要求大家都来看我
All the children were required to visit me.

1117
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:40,770
我们互相问好
We would say, "Hello,"

1118
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:42,820
接着就不知该说什么了
and then not know what to say next.

1119
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:44,970
他们都怕我
They were all terrified of me.

1120
01:08:45,510 --> 01:08:46,500
现在也是
Still are.

1121
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:48,530
我吓坏别人了
I scare the shit out of people.

1122
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,430
轮椅上的可怕姑娘
The "holy terror" in a wheelchair.

1123
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:55,200
别人也怕我
I'm scaring people, too.

1124
01:08:55,350 --> 01:08:56,670
要学会利用
Learn how to use it.

1125
01:08:57,730 --> 01:09:00,090
你不需要别人的爱和认可
Don't need everybody's love and approval.

1126
01:09:01,870 --> 01:09:04,960
奈德  你的组织是  无价的
Ned, your organization is... worthless.

1127
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:07,250
有分量的人都不肯加入
I can't get anyone important on the board.

1128
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:09,770
我看过300多病人了  就我一个人
I've seen over 300 patients. Me. One doctor.

1129
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:12,160
那些从我们身上赚得盆满钵满的
All these guys who made millions off of us...

1130
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:15,980
时尚  摇滚  电影  房地产界的  都不能指望
fashion, rock, movies, real estate, forget it.

1131
01:09:16,170 --> 01:09:18,520
布鲁斯和我一有意见不合
And any time Bruce doesn't agree with me,

1132
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:21,060
-就找董事会投票  -然后你输了
- he puts it to a board vote. - And you lose.

1133
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:23,210
如果没有绝对把握  我不会接受任何信息
I can't pass along sex recommendations

1134
01:09:23,210 --> 01:09:25,450
或是接受任何性伙伴
or any information that isn't 100% certain.

1135
01:09:25,450 --> 01:09:28,310
科学没有绝对把握
Nothing is 100% certain in science.

1136
01:09:28,310 --> 01:09:30,060
反正你也决定不了
It wouldn't matter what you say anyway.

1137
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:31,530
又不怪我  冲我吼什么
Don't yell at me for what I'm not doing.

1138
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:33,590
-你们又干什么了  -不知道
- What the fuck is your side doing? - I don't know!

1139
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:34,830
美国医学协会干什么了
Where's your A.M.A.?

1140
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:39,700
犹太人就爱饿肚子吗
Does being Jewish always make you hungry?

1141
01:09:40,370 --> 01:09:41,970
不知道  我不是犹太人
I don't know. I'm not Jewish.

1142
01:09:44,050 --> 01:09:45,050
我是德裔的
I'm German.

1143
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:48,580
-大家都以为你是犹太人  -我知道
- Everybody thinks you're Jewish. - I know.

1144
01:09:49,770 --> 01:09:51,130
在医学界可以利用这点
In medicine it helps.

1145
01:09:54,970 --> 01:09:57,450
你上学的时候一直躺着吗
You stayed in bed the whole way through school?

1146
01:09:58,270 --> 01:10:00,780
大学的时候我有了副支架
By college I had my first braces

1147
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:03,490
能走一段距离
and I could walk... a little.

1148
01:10:03,970 --> 01:10:05,110
后面就再没有过了
I don't walk so good anymore.

1149
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:07,190
也许是太忙没时间练
Probably because I'm too busy to practice.

1150
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:09,790
你一定要练
You must practice.

1151
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:12,050
就现在  真的
Right now. I mean it.

1152
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:13,960
就现在  来吧
Right now. C'mon.

1153
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:16,710
别刮坏了唱片
Don't scratch my Mathis.

1154
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:27,700
能共舞一曲吗
May I have this dance?

1155
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:34,120
好吧  随你便吧
Okay. You asked for it.

1156
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:40,390
拐杖
My crutches.

1157
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:05,520
我没事
I got it. 

1158
01:11:11,670 --> 01:11:12,870
没事的
Okay.

1159
01:11:36,050 --> 01:11:37,980
我怕他孤单终老
I'm afraid to leave him alone now.

1160
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:41,120
我怕来不及治好他
I'm afraid a cure won't come in time.

1161
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:44,180
我怕自己的怒火
I'm afraid of my anger.

1162
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:49,930
-我不是个好领导  -也不会跳舞  放我回去
- I'm a terrible leader and... - A lousy dancer. Put me back.

1163
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:11,300
脊髓灰质炎也是病毒
Polio is a virus, too.

1164
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:18,100
现在不也有解药了
Nobody gets polio anymore.

1165
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:48,350
他人呢  我们都等了一个半小时了
Where is he? We've been here for an hour and a half.

1166
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:52,080
这群人是谁啊  让我们待地下室里
Who are these people? We're in a fucking dungeon here.

1167
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:54,430
他不能这样
He can't do this to us.

1168
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:56,720
这么对我们我一定要追究他
He cannot do this to us and get away with it.

1169
01:12:59,090 --> 01:13:00,400
-开始了吗  -没有
- Did you start? - No.

1170
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,070
-好吧  你们好  -好啊
- Okay, God, hi. - Hi.

1171
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:03,830
我的天  坟墓一样
Jesus Christ, what a tomb.

1172
01:13:03,830 --> 01:13:06,140
不想让我们抛头露面吗
Do they not want us to be seen above ground?

1173
01:13:06,140 --> 01:13:08,060
他人呢  我都晚了一个小时了
And where is he? I'm an hour late.

1174
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:10,640
-一个半  -别对我撒气  小可爱
- Hour and a half. - Don't start on me, lamb chop.

1175
01:13:10,650 --> 01:13:12,850
-汤米  你去哪了  -贝尔维
- Tommy, where were you? - I was up at Bellevue.

1176
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:16,380
安排一个垂死的孩子跟母亲见面
Had to put a sweet dying child together with his mama.

1177
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,140
他们15年没见了
They hadn't seen each other for 15 years.

1178
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:22,570
孩子没对母亲说过自己是同志
He never told her he was gay.

1179
01:13:22,950 --> 01:13:25,920
他不想见她  接连几周都不想
He didn't want to see her. He refused to see her for weeks.

1180
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:28,920
我陪母亲进去时他生气极了
Oh, he was angry when I waltzed in with her.

1181
01:13:31,090 --> 01:13:33,830
看母亲抱着孩子真是催人泪下
It was a real weeper. Mama holding her son.

1182
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:35,980
他已经去了
He's dead now.

1183
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:42,030
不好意思来晚了  我是海拉姆·基博勒
I'm truly sorry I'm late. I'm Hiram Keebler.

1184
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:45,270
你好  你们家是做饼干的吗[同名]Hello. Are you related to the folks who make the crackers?

1185
01:13:45,470 --> 01:13:47,130
开玩笑的  我是汤米·博特莱特
I'm kidding. I'm Tommy Boatwright.

1186
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:48,570
奈德·威克斯
Ned Weeks.

1187
01:13:50,010 --> 01:13:51,850
布鲁斯·耐尔斯  我是主席
Bruce Niles. I'm the president.

1188
01:13:52,150 --> 01:13:53,970
市长要我转达  他十分关心
The mayor wants you to know how much he cares

1189
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:56,600
看到你们肩负的重任
and how impressed he is with how you've been shouldering

1190
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,680
他也深表赞赏
your own responsibilities.

1191
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:00,440
-谢谢  -还谢谢
- Thank you. - Thank you?

1192
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:02,210
肩负的责任  我们这么办
Responsibilities? Everything we're doing

1193
01:14:02,210 --> 01:14:04,290
就是因为你们  我们现在需要帮助
is the stuff you guys should be doing and we need help.

1194
01:14:04,290 --> 01:14:06,090
威克斯先生的意思是
What Mr. Weeks is trying to say, sir,

1195
01:14:06,090 --> 01:14:07,550
我们应付不过来
is that we're swamped.

1196
01:14:07,550 --> 01:14:11,760
每天都接到超过500个紧急求助热线
We're fielding over 500 calls a day on our emergency hotline.

1197
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:13,850
坦白说  我们现在所提供的咨询
And we're providing information that, quite frankly,

1198
01:14:13,850 --> 01:14:15,850
本该由政府来提供
the city should be providing, and isn't.

1199
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:18,010
我们需要办公的地方  这里太小了
Sir, we need office space. We have one small room.

1200
01:14:18,010 --> 01:14:20,710
每天的人流量超过100人
We have over 100 people calling or walking in and out every day,

1201
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:21,560
而且没人愿意出租
and plus it's real hard

1202
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:22,730
就因为我们是...
when people don't want to rent to us because we're...

1203
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:24,740
那是非法歧视
That's illegal discrimination.

1204
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:26,270
是的  我们都知道
Yeah, we know that to be true, sir.

1205
01:14:26,270 --> 01:14:27,320
基博勒先生
Mr. Keebler,

1206
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:28,950
歧视同性恋却不算违法
it is not illegal to discriminate against homosexuals.

1207
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:31,440
为了见市长  我们足足等了14个月
We've been waiting for 14 months to see the mayor.

1208
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:33,290
光是约你在这会面就花了一年时间
It's taken us a year to get this meeting with you.

1209
01:14:33,290 --> 01:14:34,710
而且你还晚了一个半小时
You're an hour and a half late.

1210
01:14:34,710 --> 01:14:36,950
你有告诉市长传染病的事吗
Have you told the mayor there's an epidemic going on?

1211
01:14:36,950 --> 01:14:38,450
-谁说的传染病  -政府
- Says who? - The government.

1212
01:14:38,450 --> 01:14:40,050
哪个政府  咱们政府吗
Which government? What? Our government?

1213
01:14:40,050 --> 01:14:42,360
-传染病?  -疾控中心已发出声明
- An epidemic? - The Centers for Disease Control declared it.

1214
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:44,590
-在17个月前  -你不可能不知道
- 17 months ago. - You can't not know this!

1215
01:14:44,590 --> 01:14:46,530
能别那么歇斯底里吗
Could you please reduce your level of hysteria?

1216
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:47,530
当然可以
Certainly.

1217
01:14:49,130 --> 01:14:52,370
纽约  旧金山  洛杉矶
New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles,

1218
01:14:52,370 --> 01:14:54,720
芝加哥  波士顿  丹佛
Chicago, Boston, Denver.

1219
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:57,860
美国的大城市都发现了病例
Every single major American city is now showing cases.

1220
01:14:57,860 --> 01:14:59,220
还包括至少25个国家
At least 25 foreign countries.

1221
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:00,580
纽约作为我们的家
But New York City,

1222
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:03,110
作为你们承诺过要保护的城市
our home, the city that you have pledged to protect

1223
01:15:03,110 --> 01:15:04,660
这里什么都占大多数
has more than half of everything.

1224
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:06,450
大多数的病例  大多数的死者
Half the cases, half the dead.

1225
01:15:06,450 --> 01:15:09,140
死去的人里我认识57个  不想再有了
I know 57 of the dead ones. I don't wanna know any more.

1226
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:11,200
我们什么时候可以见市长
Now, when do we get to see the mayor?

1227
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,570
花14个月吃午餐未免也太久了
14 months is a long time to be out to lunch.

1228
01:15:13,570 --> 01:15:16,330
-你先等一下  -不  我们不能等了
- You wait a minute. - No, you wait a minute. We can't.

1229
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:17,840
时间可不等人
Time is not on our side.

1230
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:20,380
如果你不带话给市长  我们怎么办
Now, if you won't take word to the mayor, what are we gonna do?

1231
01:15:20,380 --> 01:15:22,850
把请愿纹在应召男的鸡巴上
Hire a hunky hustler and send him up to Gracie Mansion

1232
01:15:22,850 --> 01:15:24,930
再送到市长府邸吗
with a plea tattooed to his cock?

1233
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:28,360
-科奇市长不是同性恋  -少来了  小姐妹
- Mayor Koch is not gay! - Oh, come on, "Blanche."

1234
01:15:31,750 --> 01:15:32,560
听着
Listen.

1235
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:34,890
你们以为我不想帮忙吗
Don't you think I want to help you?

1236
01:15:36,050 --> 01:15:38,530
我有个朋友就是因为这鬼东西
I have a friend who is dying of this shit,

1237
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:40,470
正在退役军人医院里垂死挣扎
right now in the V.A. Hospital.

1238
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:44,830
可是你们也知道  这很难办
But it's very tricky. You can see that. It is very tricky.

1239
01:15:44,830 --> 01:15:47,180
难办个屁  纽约有100万同志
Tricky, shit! There are a million gay people in New York.

1240
01:15:47,180 --> 01:15:48,950
他们跟我都指望着你
A million and one counting you!

1241
01:15:49,010 --> 01:15:49,630
告诉你
You know what?

1242
01:15:49,630 --> 01:15:52,310
西区有所学校的火炉失火了
A fire goes out in a school furnace on the West Side.

1243
01:15:52,310 --> 01:15:56,010
那一天我就接到了3000个电话
I get 3,000 calls in one day.

1244
01:15:56,020 --> 01:15:57,100
懂我的意思没
You know what I mean?

1245
01:15:57,810 --> 01:15:59,650
要是你们有那么不满
If so many of you are so upset,

1246
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:00,990
为什么就只听到这大嘴巴在讲
why do I only hear from this loudmouth?

1247
01:16:00,990 --> 01:16:02,700
问得真好
That's a very good question.

1248
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:05,750
我们这有着50万的同性恋
Okay, so there are half a million gay men in our area.

1249
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:08,540
315例也不算太高
315 cases doesn't seem too high,

1250
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:11,220
还要考虑到这么大的人口基数
considering how many of us... of you there are.

1251
01:16:11,220 --> 01:16:13,130
-真是扯淡  -奈德  别
- This is bullshit! - Ned, please.

1252
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,930
长官  我知道这很难办
Look, I understand this is tricky, sir.

1253
01:16:14,930 --> 01:16:15,920
可是我们需要你的帮助
But we need your help.

1254
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:17,780
我觉得  同时市长也是这么想的
I think, that is, that the mayor thinks

1255
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:18,890
你们反应过度了
you guys are overreacting.

1256
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:20,710
你去告诉那个混蛋
You tell that cocksucker,

1257
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:23,550
他就是个自私冷血的杂种
he is a selfish, heartless son of a bitch!

1258
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:32,200
你是迈克尔·R·马库斯
You are Michael R. Marcus. 

1259
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:34,920
卫生署的保密工作可做得不到位
You hold an unsecure job with the city's Department of Health.

1260
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,640
换作是我就会提防一下你的朋友
I'd watch out for your friends if I were you.

1261
01:16:49,310 --> 01:16:50,560
我真不敢相信
I don't believe that just happened.

1262
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:53,320
米奇  明天我要上"今日秀"
Mickey, I am going on "The Today Show" Tomorrow,

1263
01:16:53,330 --> 01:16:54,690
我要告诉他们
and I am telling them,

1264
01:16:54,690 --> 01:16:57,730
市长通过威胁你的工作来让我们闭嘴
that the mayor just threatened your job to shut us up.

1265
01:16:57,730 --> 01:16:59,580
"今日秀"  你要干什么
"The Today Show"? You're gonna what?

1266
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:02,560
他们不把我们当人看  我们居然容忍他
They are treating us like shit and we're allowing them.

1267
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:03,460
不  政客就这样
No, politicians,

1268
01:17:03,470 --> 01:17:06,570
不施加压力就没有回应
the only thing they really respond to is pressure.

1269
01:17:06,570 --> 01:17:09,530
他不是说着火就有3000个电话吗
You heard him with his "3,000 West Side calls."

1270
01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:11,190
是因为我们的呼声不够壮大
We're not yelling loud enough!

1271
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:17,940
拿好东西
Get your stuff.

1272
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:19,430
拿好东西
Get your stuff.

1273
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:41,210
-我是汤米  -汤米  我是奈德
- This is Tommy. - Tommy, it's Ned.

1274
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:43,080
尼克死了
Nick died.

1275
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:46,040
操
Shit.

1276
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:48,410
该死的
God damn.

1277
01:17:49,330 --> 01:17:51,870
追悼会的安排我晚点再告诉你
I'll call later when I know more about the memorial.

1278
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:01,590
我有个惯例
I have this tradition.

1279
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:05,940
当有朋友离世  我就会这样做
It's something I do now when a friend dies.

1280
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:10,890
把他的名片留存下来
I save his Rolodex card.

1281
01:18:12,630 --> 01:18:13,660
我还能做什么
What am I supposed to do?

1282
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:15,610
扔进垃圾堆吗
Throw it away in the trash can?

1283
01:18:16,370 --> 01:18:17,350
我不会那么做
I won't do that.

1284
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:19,410
我不会
No, I won't.

1285
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:21,240
那太绝情了
That's too final.

1286
01:18:25,570 --> 01:18:27,860
去年  我收藏了五张
Last year I had five cards.

1287
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:30,200
现在我一共有五十张
Now I have 50.

1288
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:34,240
名片做成的墓碑
A collection of cardboard tombstones,

1289
01:18:34,670 --> 01:18:36,500
用橡皮筋捆在一起
bound together with a rubber band.

1290
01:18:38,650 --> 01:18:40,330
我憎恶这些该死的葬礼
I hate these fuckin' funerals.

1291
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:42,080
真的
I really do.

1292
01:18:44,250 --> 01:18:45,630
知道我还憎恶什么吗
And you know what else I hate?

1293
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:47,470
我憎恶追悼会
I hate the memorials.

1294
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:49,790
现在我们社交生活的主要内容
That's our social life now.

1295
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,040
就是参加追悼会
Going to these things.

1296
01:18:58,810 --> 01:19:00,310
尼克是个舞蹈指导
Nick was a choreographer.

1297
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,540
你们了解这个职业吗
I don't know if any of you knew that.

1298
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:06,170
他才刚刚起步
He was just starting out. 

1299
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:07,730
没有告诉很多人
He didn't tell a lot of people.

1300
01:19:09,550 --> 01:19:10,790
他还想着邀请你们参加
He was waiting to invite you

1301
01:19:10,790 --> 01:19:13,760
他在卡内基音乐厅什么的首演
to his big debut at Carnegie Hall or some shit

1302
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:15,200
好让我们都以他为豪
so we could all be proud of him.

1303
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:20,820
他曾经如此优秀
But he was so good.

1304
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,140
如此前途无量
He had such promise.

1305
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:30,410
我们失去了整整一代人
We're losing an entire generation.

1306
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:34,530
刚刚起步的年轻人
Young men at the beginning.

1307
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:36,040
就这么去世了
Just gone.

1308
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:40,520
舞蹈指导  剧作家
Choreographers, playwrights,

1309
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:43,560
舞者  演员
dancers, actors.

1310
01:19:45,570 --> 01:19:48,140
损失了那么多无法投诸笔端的剧作
All those plays that won't get written now.

1311
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:54,350
再也无缘得见那么多姿态翩翩的舞蹈
All those dances never to be danced.

1312
01:19:59,530 --> 01:20:01,820
最后  我只想说我已经不再正常
In closing, I'm just gonna say I'm mad.

1313
01:20:02,930 --> 01:20:04,610
我真他妈已经疯了
I'm fuckin' mad.

1314
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:09,260
内心的声音一直在喊  "他们为什么看着我们死"
I keep screaming inside, "Why are they letting us die?"

1315
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:12,630
"为什么没人帮我们"
"Why is no one helping us?"

1316
01:20:17,310 --> 01:20:18,680
真相是
And here's the truth.

1317
01:20:19,870 --> 01:20:21,050
答案是
Here's the answer.

1318
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:26,160
他们就是不喜欢我们
They just don't like us.

1319
01:21:41,210 --> 01:21:42,560
我能战胜它
I'm going to beat this.

1320
01:21:44,910 --> 01:21:46,320
我一直是个幸运儿
I've always been lucky.

1321
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:52,300
很好  这才是正确的态度
Good. That's the right attitude.

1322
01:21:54,030 --> 01:21:56,280
我以前想在《时报》上班  我成功了
I wanted a job on the "Times," I got it.

1323
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:59,020
我想要奈德
I wanted Ned.

1324
01:22:04,850 --> 01:22:06,380
我传染给奈德了吗
Have I given it to Ned?

1325
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:08,580
我不知道
I don't know.

1326
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:17,460
有人得了感冒
One person has a cold,

1327
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:20,080
他的伴侣也许会得  也许不会
sometimes the partner catches it, sometimes not.

1328
01:22:21,190 --> 01:22:24,100
有医生说  用安全套就没事
Some doctors are saying it's okay if we use condoms.

1329
01:22:24,490 --> 01:22:25,450
我知道
I know they are.

1330
01:22:40,470 --> 01:22:42,400
-我们能接吻吗  -菲力克斯
- Can we kiss? - Felix.

1331
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:44,010
你对病菌完全没有抵抗力
You have nothing to fight back with.

1332
01:22:44,010 --> 01:22:46,140
你的免疫系统几乎不能叫免疫系统
You have no immune system to speak of.

1333
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:49,220
任何东西都可能感染你的身体
Your body is now open to every conceivable type of infection.

1334
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:50,470
你必须十分小心
You must be careful.

1335
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:52,590
我会全力以赴  你也得这么做
I'm going to do my damnedest, so must you.

1336
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:56,300
我打赌你对所有小伙子们都这么说
I bet you say that to all the boys.

1337
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:57,490
其实呢
As a matter of fact,

1338
01:22:58,920 --> 01:22:59,770
是的
I do.

1339
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,800
老天
Oh, God.

1340
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:39,060
曾经有个棒小伙
Once upon a time there was a little boy

1341
01:23:39,070 --> 01:23:41,160
总想爱上另一个棒小伙
who always wanted to love another little boy.

1342
01:23:42,810 --> 01:23:44,780
有一天  他总算找到了这份爱
One day he finally found that love

1343
01:23:44,780 --> 01:23:46,100
简直太美好了
and it was wonderful.

1344
01:23:48,210 --> 01:23:49,750
我本该戴手套
I'm supposed to use gloves.

1345
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:52,180
本来应该做这  本来应该做那
I'm supposed to do this. I'm supposed to do that.

1346
01:23:52,180 --> 01:23:53,680
本来不该吻他

01:30:16,590 --> 01:30:17,880
他们要撤销我们的医疗保险
They're gonna cancel our health insurance,

1479
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:19,780
他们要把我们送到集中营  隔离我们
they're gonna put us into camps, they're gonna quarantine us.

1480
01:30:19,780 --> 01:30:21,530
你觉得我在杀人吗
And you think that I'm killing people?

1481
01:30:21,530 --> 01:30:22,500
我说的不是这个意思
That is not what I said.

1482
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,560
就是这个意思  你知道你自己说了什么
It is, you know you said it.

1483
01:30:26,910 --> 01:30:29,110
我花了十五年时间
I've spent 15 years of my life

1484
01:30:29,110 --> 01:30:30,790
来为我们自由的权利作斗争
fighting for our right to be free

1485
01:30:30,790 --> 01:30:32,630
还为了能随时随地的做爱
and to make love wherever, whenever.

1486
01:30:32,630 --> 01:30:34,010
你却告诉我这么多年来
And you're telling me all those years

1487
01:30:34,010 --> 01:30:36,630
为同志争取权利是错的
of what being gay stood for is wrong!

1488
01:30:37,650 --> 01:30:38,910
还认为我是凶手
And that I'm a murderer.

1489
01:30:41,060 --> 01:30:44,930
我们一直在压抑自己  你都不记得了吗
We have been so oppressed. Don't you remember?

1490
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:49,260
你不知道我们不用躲  没有愧疚  大胆去爱
Can't you see how important it is for us to love openly,

1491
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:51,970
有多重要吗
without hiding, without guilt?

1492
01:30:52,590 --> 01:30:54,890
你怎么就不明白
Why can't you see that?

1493
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:01,590
我上到了帝国大厦最顶楼
I went to the top of the Empire State Building.

1494
01:31:01,590 --> 01:31:03,070
我送你回家
Okay, I'm taking you home.

1495
01:31:03,070 --> 01:31:05,060
可以趁人不注意从上面跳下去
You can jump off from there when nobody's looking.

1496
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:06,690
好了  米奇  我们回家吧  就现在
All right, Mickey, let's go home. Right now.

1497
01:31:12,970 --> 01:31:15,330
奈德  我不是凶手  我不是
Ned, I'm not a murderer. I'm not.

1498
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:20,100
我这辈子一直恨自己是同志
All my life I've been hated for being gay,

1499
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:21,300
个子矮
for being short...

1500
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:23,100
还是犹太人
Jewish.

1501
01:31:23,790 --> 01:31:25,200
所以你继续  告诉大家
So go ahead, you tell everybody.

1502
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:27,170
告诉大家我们错了  我很抱歉
Tell everybody that we were wrong and I'm sorry.

1503
01:31:27,270 --> 01:31:29,320
总有一天  有人会站出来
Someday, somebody's gonna come along

1504
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:31,420
会一刀捅向你  告诉你
and they're gonna stick the knife in you

1505
01:31:31,420 --> 01:31:34,850
你抗争的事  你这辈子都是扯淡
and tell you everything you fought for your whole life is shit!

1506
01:31:34,850 --> 01:31:35,630
米奇
Mickey!

1507
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:37,730
米奇  起来
Mickey! Get up!

1508
01:31:37,730 --> 01:31:40,080
-起来  过来  -没事
- Get up. Come here. - It's okay.

1509
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:41,470

Come on.

1510
01:31:42,370 --> 01:31:44,180
我送你回家  好吗
I'm gonna take you home now, okay?

1511
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:48,780
我不想回家  带我去圣文森特
I don't wanna go home. Take me to St.Vincent's.

1512
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:52,780
好  没事  来吧  走
Okay. That's fine. Come. Let's go.

1513
01:31:54,850 --> 01:31:57,170
我们都很累了  听到了吗
Look, we're all real tired, you hear me?

1514
01:31:58,050 --> 01:32:02,290
大家走了不少朋友  都很悲伤
We got ourselves here a lot of bereavement overload.

1515
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:11,820
我们是斗士  不是吗
We're the fighters. Aren't we?

1516
01:32:11,820 --> 01:32:14,130
-我们是斗  -没错  亲爱的

你还是位英雄
And you're a hero

1518
01:32:16,470 --> 01:32:17,390
听到没
You hear me?

1519
01:32:17,470 --> 01:32:19,960
不管你知道与否  你都是个英雄 
You're a hero whether you know that or not.

1520
01:32:21,450 --> 01:32:22,900
你是我们的第一位英雄
You're our first hero.

1521
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:24,160
走吧
Let's go.

1522
01:32:34,830 --> 01:32:36,240
你想当主席
You wanna be president?

1523
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:38,540
我只想让菲利克斯活下去

1524

1526
01:33:10,740 --> 01:33:12,020
-准备好了吗  -是的

1527
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,270
市长找到了个秘密小型基金会
The Mayor's found a secret little fund

1528
01:33:15,270 --> 01:33:17,300
能私底下把钱捐给我们

1529
01:33:17,930 --> 01:33:19,890
但我们不能说出钱的来源
We are not allowed to tell anyone where we got it,

1530
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:22,580
要是说出去了  以后一个子都没了
and if we do, we'll never get any more.

1531
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:25,220
-多少钱  -九千美金

1532
01:33:27,850 --> 01:33:28,610

艾伯特死了

His mother wanted to see him in Phoenix before he died.

1535
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:44,340
这是上周的事  当时已经很明显了
And this was the last week, when it was obvious.

1536
01:33:45,170 --> 01:33:49,010
艾玛同意了  我就带他去了机场
So I got permission from Emma and took him to the airport.

1537
01:33:58,140 --> 01:33:59,610
当我们到机场的时候

1538
01:34:00,170 --> 01:34:02,460
飞行员不肯飞
the pilot refused to fly the plane.

1539
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:05,360
我也拒绝下飞机
So I refused to get off of it.

1540
01:34:07,310 --> 01:34:09,630
你肯定会为我骄傲  奈德
You would have been very proud of me, Ned.

1541
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:13,090
我们最后换了一个飞行员
So finally we get another pilot

1542
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:17,110
飞机起飞时
and when we take off,

1543
01:34:18,820 --> 01:34:20,780
艾伯特失去了理智
Albert just loses his mind.

1544
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:23,560
我不想把事情搞成这样

1555
01:34:50,130 --> 01:34:51,630
他不认得我
He doesn't recognize me.

1556
01:34:55,070 --> 01:34:55,620
是我啊  是我

1560
01:35:03,420 --> 01:35:04,770
他变得…
He just becomes...

1561
01:35:05,820 --> 01:35:09,330
妈的  能给我块毛巾吗
Oh, shit. Can I get a goddamn towel, please?

1562
01:35:09,330 --> 01:35:12,710
当我们到达凤凰城的医院时 
When we land in Phoenix and when we get to the hospital

1563
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:16,440
他妈妈准备了一间非常漂亮的房间
where his mother had fixed up the room real nice...

1564
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:21,650
艾伯特却死了
Albert is dead.

1565
01:35:27,220 --> 01:35:30,020
医院医生拒绝给他做检查
The hospital doctors refused to examine him

1566
01:35:30,020 --> 01:35:32,790
也拒绝在死亡证明上给出死因
and give him a cause of death on his death certificate.

1567
01:35:32,790 --> 01:35:36,380
没有死亡证  丧事承办员不能带走遗体
Without the death certificate, the undertakers will not take him.

1568
01:35:36,380 --> 01:35:39,010

最终  某个护理员进来把艾伯特
Finally some orderly comes in and stuffs my Albert

1570
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:46,300
装进了一个超大号垃圾袋
in an oversized glad garbage bag

1571
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:49,240
把他跟其他垃圾扔到了巷子里
and puts him in the alley with the rest of the garbage.

1572
01:35:50,940 --> 01:35:53,030
伙计  我帮了你  我把他弄出来了

01:36:47,180 --> 01:36:49,280
"我告诉你们  他们要杀死我们

"我们快死了"
We're gonna die."

1582
01:36:52,630 --> 01:36:54,090
"我们很快就会死了
"We're gonna die very soon,

1583
01:36:54,090 --> 01:36:57,040
"除非你们奋起反抗"
unless you get off your fucking asses and fight back."

1584
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:15,020
艾玛等着呢
Emma's in there waiting.

1585
01:37:28,610 --> 01:37:30,590
张嘴 就两口  吃点东西
Come on, two bites. Come on, now.

1586
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:34,740
-不吃  -别逼我倒了这碗酸奶
- No. - Don't make me break out the yogurt.

- One more. - Have you talked to your brother yet?

1588
01:37:50,540 --> 01:37:52,420
我就知道你是这样
I remember that about you.

1589
01:37:54,140 --> 01:37:57,060
你不会跟最爱的人说
You don't talk to the people you love most in the world.

1590
01:38:04,040 --> 01:38:06,700
你想让我好受点  我不觉得好受
You want me to get better and I'm not getting better

1591
01:38:06,710 --> 01:38:08,800
我充满了罪恶感
and I feel so fucking guilty.

1592
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:24,420
你周五约了比尔·布拉斯吃午饭

I've been invited to speak at Yale's Gay Week.

1598

我不该那么说的
I'm not supposed to say that.

1603
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:28,350
上帝  再给我们一年时间吧
Oh, please, God. Give us one more year.

1604
01:39:32,740 --> 01:39:34,620
我用吃菠菜发誓

1606
01:40:03,950 --> 01:40:05,660
更关心生这种病的人

01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:18,820
布鲁克纳医生  政府的立场是这样
Dr. Brookner, the government's position is this.

1611
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:22,640
我们可以帮助病人的资金只有五百万
There are $5 million in the pipeline for which we have received

1612
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:25,630
接到的申请却有五千多万
over $55 million worth of requests.

1613
01:40:25,630 --> 01:40:29,560
五百万还不够两千个病人吧
5 million doesn't seem quite right for some 2,000 cases.

1614
01:40:29,560 --> 01:40:31,430
政府花了三百万
The government spent 3 million

1615
01:40:31,430 --> 01:40:34,240
来调查泰勒诺的七起死亡案
investigating seven deaths from Tylenol.

1616
01:40:34,250 --> 01:40:35,840
我们已经做了三年
We're entering the third year.

1617
01:40:35,850 --> 01:40:38,340
我们投票决定拒绝你的资金申请
We voted to reject your application for funding.

1618
01:40:41,970 --> 01:40:43,790
我想听一下理由
I'd like to hear your reasons.

1619
01:40:43,790 --> 01:40:45,620
你所提出的研究方向
The direction of the research you're suggesting

1620
01:40:45,620 --> 01:40:47,140
不够精确也没有重点
is imprecise and unfocused.

1621
01:40:48,430 --> 01:40:50,010
是吗  是吗
Oh, it is, is it?

1622
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,260
你压根就不知道我做了哪些事
You don't know what's going on any more than I do.

1623
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:56,610
你能准确地告诉我  你阻止我的原因吗
Could you tell me precisely why you're blocking my efforts?

1624
01:40:56,620 --> 01:40:59,460
布鲁克纳医生  这不是我一个调查员的决定
Dr. Brookner. There are now other investigators.

1625
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:01,330
这不再是你一个人的研究
This is no longer only your disease,

1626
01:41:01,330 --> 01:41:02,580
哪怕你以为是
though you seem to think it is.

1627
01:41:02,580 --> 01:41:03,920
我以为是吗
Oh, I do, do I?

1628
01:41:04,290 --> 01:41:06,750
你要把它带走  是这样吗
And you're here to take it away from me, is that it?

1629
01:41:07,310 --> 01:41:09,510
我跟你分享个小秘密  医生
Well, I'll let you in on a little secret, Doctor.

1630
01:41:09,510 --> 01:41:11,220
你拿去吧  我根本就不想要
You can have it. I didn't want it in the first place.

1631
01:41:11,230 --> 01:41:13,800
看着年轻小伙子死去是好事吗
You think it's a privilege to watch young men die?

1632
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:15,710
我跟你争执什么
What am I arguing with you for?

1633
01:41:15,710 --> 01:41:17,990
你连开水都不了解
You do not know enough to study boiled water.

1634
01:41:17,990 --> 01:41:20,340
怎么敢跑来评判我
How dare you come down here and judge me?!

1635
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:21,550
我们是穆雷医生
We only serve on this peer

1636
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:23,530
指导的审查小组的一员
review panel at the behest of Dr. Murray.

1637
01:41:23,530 --> 01:41:27,180
又一个白痴  还是个未出柜的男同
Another idiot... and, by the way, a closeted homosexual

1638
01:41:27,180 --> 01:41:31,060
尽他一切所能掩埋此事
doing everything in his power to sweep this under the rug.

1639
01:41:31,550 --> 01:41:34,690
我发誓我从未对外透露任何信息
And I vowed I'd never say anything like that in public.

1640
01:41:34,790 --> 01:41:36,280
为什么你的队伍
How does it always happen

1641
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:39,070
都是白痴在充数
that all of the idiots are always on your team?

1642
01:41:39,070 --> 01:41:42,070
你怎么能拒绝资助我的研究
How can you refuse to fund my research

1643
01:41:42,070 --> 01:41:45,360
或者邀请我加入你们
or not invite me to participate in yours?

1644
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:47,520
国家卫生研究院
Your National Institutes of Health

1645
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:50,990
两年前就收到了我请求拨款的申请
received my first request for money two years ago.

1646
01:41:51,150 --> 01:41:54,500
你花了一年打印出申请表
It took you one year just to print up application forms.

1647
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:57,140
距我第一次通报案例三年后
It's taken you three years from my first reported case

1648
01:41:57,140 --> 01:42:01,000
你来这看了一眼  我们请求的资助
just to show up here for a look, and the paltry amount of money

1649
01:42:01,010 --> 01:42:04,720
跟你们每年得到的40亿相比
you are forcing us to beg for out of the $4 billion

1650
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:07,390
是微不足道的
you now receive each and every year

1651
01:42:07,390 --> 01:42:11,360
你们拨款保护的
to protect the health of American people

1652
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:14,390
是屁事都没有的健康人民
won't come to anyone before only God knows when.

1653
01:42:14,430 --> 01:42:16,730
法国已经找到可能的病毒了
A promising virus has been discovered in France.

1654
01:42:16,730 --> 01:42:18,830
你为什么拒绝跟法国合作
Why do you refuse to cooperate with the French?

1655
01:42:18,830 --> 01:42:22,430
为什么不让我们跟法国合作
Why are we told not to cooperate with the French?

1656
01:42:22,430 --> 01:42:24,690
好在疾病泛滥  死伤无数时
Just so you can steal a Nobel Prize

1657
01:42:24,690 --> 01:42:29,220
你趁机拿个诺贝尔奖吗
while something is being passed around that causes death!

1658
01:42:30,830 --> 01:42:32,620
在非洲已经出现女性病例
Women have been discovered to have it in Africa

1659
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:35,450
这显然是会通过异性传染的
where it is clearly transmitted heterosexually.

1660
01:42:35,450 --> 01:42:37,300
只是时间的问题
It is only a question of time.

1661
01:42:37,300 --> 01:42:40,100
在你有所行动前我们可能都死了
We could all be dead before you do anything.

1662
01:42:40,100 --> 01:42:42,690
你要我的数据  我的观点
You want my data? You want my ideas?

1663
01:42:42,690 --> 01:42:44,510
我的病人  拿去
You want my patients? Take them!

1664
01:42:44,510 --> 01:42:46,890
只要你能为他们做点什么
Just do something with them!

1665
01:42:52,110 --> 01:42:54,230
你他妈的说得对  我...
You're fucking right! I am...

1666
01:42:54,230 --> 01:42:58,150
不严密  没有目标  而你们都是白痴
imprecise and unfocused and you are all idiots!

1667
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:14,220
针对市长的抗议是你组织的吗
Did you organize that picketing of the mayor?

1668
01:43:14,220 --> 01:43:15,100
是
Yes.

1669
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:17,450
-签字呢  -是
- And the signs? - Yes.

1670
01:43:17,590 --> 01:43:20,060
你下出戏扮演第一夫人
And your next play is about a First Lady

1671
01:43:20,060 --> 01:43:22,820
-好莱坞最出色的口交演员  -是
- who gave the best blow jobs in Hollywood. - Yes.

1672
01:43:22,820 --> 01:43:26,120
-这里是我们的完美新办公室  -是
- This place is perfect for our new office. - Yes.

1673
01:43:36,030 --> 01:43:37,360
很整齐
So tidy.

1674
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:40,180
来
Here.

1675
01:43:42,240 --> 01:43:43,750
我来就行  我来就行
I got him. I got him.

1676
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:45,600
来  扶你到床上去
Come on. Let's get you back to bed.

1677
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:46,830
好
Okay.

1678
01:43:49,210 --> 01:43:50,270
来吧
Here you go.

1679
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:53,730
艾斯特尔给你做了菜卷
Estelle made you some stuffed cabbage for later.

1680
01:43:56,920 --> 01:43:59,230
这是巴黎的新药
There's this new drug in Paris.

1681
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:02,540
凯斯勒的爱人急着想试
Kessler's lover is flying out to get it.

1682
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:07,810
在这  HPA-23
Here it is. HPA-23.

1683
01:44:10,930 --> 01:44:12,040
奈德
Ned.

1684
01:44:15,270 --> 01:44:17,660
-他看着很糟糕  -这药
- He looks awful - You this is anything

1685
01:44:17,660 --> 01:44:20,210
跟其他药一样没效果吗
or is it just another shit drug like all the rest?

1686
01:44:24,970 --> 01:44:27,870
我认为你要做好放手的准备
I think you need to prepare yourself for letting go.

1687
01:44:30,530 --> 01:44:33,010
为自己爱的人要抗争到底
You can't stop fighting for the ones you love.

1688
01:44:34,270 --> 01:44:36,680
你试过为爱人战斗吗
Haven't you ever had to fight for somebody you love?

1689
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:50,060
汤米  你要开始站出来
Tommy. You gotta start putting yourself out there

1690
01:44:50,060 --> 01:44:52,510
让大家见到我所见到的
in a way that everyone else could see what I see.

1691
01:44:56,630 --> 01:44:59,180
还真是一出苦情戏
What kind of a fucked-up love scene is this?

1692
01:45:10,830 --> 01:45:11,860
是
Yes?

1693
01:45:13,210 --> 01:45:14,330
是  女士
Yes, ma'am?

1694
01:45:15,750 --> 01:45:17,100
明天四点半
4.30 tomorrow?

1695
01:45:17,700 --> 01:45:18,860
是  女士
Yes, ma'am.

1696
01:45:21,250 --> 01:45:22,770
是他妈的白宫
The fucking White House.

1697
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:26,690
他妈的市长  我被邀请去白宫了
Fuck the mayor. I've just been invited to the White House.

1698
01:45:26,690 --> 01:45:28,220
他们准备做点什么了
They're gonna do something!

1699
01:45:33,340 --> 01:45:35,080
我只想问
Oh, just so I understand,

1700
01:45:35,080 --> 01:45:37,610
我们被瘟疫侵蚀
what exactly does your title mean

1701
01:45:37,610 --> 01:45:39,410
你这个顾问能干嘛
in terms of our plague?

1702
01:45:40,170 --> 01:45:43,290
我们倾向用正面的措词  否则人民会害怕
We prefer not to use negative terms. It only scares people.

1703
01:45:43,290 --> 01:45:47,050
目前已有3339人患病
Well, there's 3,339 cases so far.

1704
01:45:47,050 --> 01:45:49,820
1122人死亡
1,122 dead.

1705
01:45:49,930 --> 01:45:52,090
我看就是瘟疫  我害怕
Sounds like a plague to me. I'm scared.

1706
01:45:52,090 --> 01:45:53,300
你不害怕吗
Aren't you?

1707
01:45:54,360 --> 01:45:56,060
你这顾问能干什么来着
What does your title mean again?

1708
01:45:56,060 --> 01:45:58,030
我为总统出主意
I come up with ideas for the president

1709
01:45:58,030 --> 01:46:00,300
告诉他该做什么不该做什么
about what he ought to be doing and not doing.

1710
01:46:00,300 --> 01:46:01,370
好的  了解
Okay, good. Got it.

1711
01:46:01,370 --> 01:46:04,450
钱款还没花出
So, the money's there, right? It just hasn't been spent.

1712
01:46:04,460 --> 01:46:07,570
法国有了新药
So there's this new drug in France.

1713
01:46:07,580 --> 01:46:09,360
为什么卫生研究院没研究看看
Why doesn't the N.I.H. study it?

1714
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:12,690
我想要  我们想要  迫切需要的是
I mean, what I want, what we want, what we desperately need

1715
01:46:12,690 --> 01:46:15,400
有个人帮我们省掉这繁文缛节
is for somebody to help us cut through all this red tape.

1716
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:17,450
我可以明确地告诉你  一周之内
I can asure you that not a week goes by

1717
01:46:17,450 --> 01:46:20,270
我是不会向总统上报任何事情的
that I don't bring new information and reports to the President.

1718
01:46:20,270 --> 01:46:22,360
我们已取得了前所未有的进展
The progress that's been made on this disease is unprecedented.

1719
01:46:22,370 --> 01:46:24,210
但这个病会传染啊
But it's contagious.

1720
01:46:24,210 --> 01:46:25,870
你不明白吗  这是传染病
Can't you see that because it's contagious,

1721
01:46:25,870 --> 01:46:28,820
所以你们得...你们得加快动作吗
you... you have to work faster?

1722
01:46:30,790 --> 01:46:32,530
你真的觉得面对这事
Do you really believe that anybody

1723
01:46:32,530 --> 01:46:35,630
研究公共政策的学者不管是对民众
in a serious public policy position in their heart of hearts

1724
01:46:35,630 --> 01:46:37,840
还是在私底下的会议里
or even in their most closeted meetings

1725
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:39,820
能坦然地说出
says to each other, "Hey, guys,

1726
01:46:39,820 --> 01:46:41,590
"这件事大伙别太难过"吗
let's not get too upset about this"?

1727
01:46:41,590 --> 01:46:42,700
是的  你的上司
Yes, your boss

1728
01:46:42,700 --> 01:46:45,120
就没敢大声地说出"艾滋"这个词
hasn't said the word "AIDS" out loud.

1729
01:46:57,780 --> 01:46:59,460
回答我一个问题
Answer me this one question.

1730
01:47:00,900 --> 01:47:03,060
这种病  妓女...妓女会染上吗
This shit, can... can hookers get it?

1731
01:47:03,060 --> 01:47:05,350
或者说  有过一夜情的人
Or, you know, someone who had a one-night stand?

1732
01:47:05,350 --> 01:47:07,250
-当然会  -你没办法证明这一点
- Of course. - You can't prove that.

1733
01:47:07,400 --> 01:47:09,340
就我的理解和我读的报告而言
I mean, from what I understand, what I've read,

1734
01:47:09,340 --> 01:47:12,900
男女之间普通的阴道性交
female-to-male transmissions through normal vaginal intercourse

1735
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:14,200
好像不太能传染这种病
does not seem to be very efficient.

1736
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:15,410
这种想法显然是错的啊
That simply isn't true.

1737
01:47:15,410 --> 01:47:17,430
这是种病毒  又不懂歧视
It's a virus, it doesn't discriminate.

1738
01:47:17,430 --> 01:47:18,150
是的  但是...
Yes, but...

1739
01:47:19,140 --> 01:47:21,760
这样传染是很难的  不是吗
it's very difficult. Isn't it?

1740
01:47:21,770 --> 01:47:25,130
对于直男而言
It's almost impossible for a straight,

1741
01:47:25,130 --> 01:47:27,490
就是指那些普通的异性恋
you know, regular heterosexual guy

1742
01:47:27,490 --> 01:47:28,630
是很难染上的  我说的对吗

1743
01:47:28,630 --> 01:47:31,170
-什么意思  -没有被证实的案例  是吗

没有一份被证实的案例
There's not a single documented case

1746
01:47:36,380 --> 01:47:39,230
无论是通过阴道性交或者是口交
Not from fucking or a blow job?

1747
01:47:39,570 --> 01:47:41,700
我没听过这方面的消息
I don't have that information.

1748
01:47:47,770 --> 01:47:49,440
太好了  我正是这么想的

二楼需要保安

1756
01:48:57,410 --> 01:48:59,070
你为什么要坐在地上
Why you sitting on the floor?

1757
01:48:59,070 --> 01:49:02,440
我想走过来  结果摔倒了
I fell down trying to get from there to here.

1758
01:49:07,460 --> 01:49:09,560
别碰我  天呐
Oh, don't touch me! God.

1759
01:49:13,610 --> 01:49:15,190
我讨厌你看着我

我饿了  你呢
I'm hungry, how about you?

1762
01:49:24,660 --> 01:49:26,530
我想遍了和我约会的人
I looked in all my datebooks.

1763
01:49:27,640 --> 01:49:29,780
睡过的人没有得病的
No one else I slept with is sick.

1764
01:49:29,780 --> 01:49:31,420
说不定你才是携带者
Maybe you're the carrier.

1765
01:49:37,770 --> 01:49:39,680
没必要这样对对方吧
We don't have to do this to each other.

1766
01:49:41,610 --> 01:49:42,710
你会好起来的  菲利克斯

1771

那我怎么才能做到这一点呢
And how am I supposed to do that?

1772

我不想让你看见
I don't wanna make you see it.

1780
01:50:31,410 --> 01:50:32,810
没人能指挥我干什么事
Nobody can make me do anything.

1781
01:50:32,810 --> 01:50:34,320
你应该比别人更清楚这一点

1782
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:36,810
现在  你是打算坐一辈子吗

但仍然没有任何效果

1791

你不能强迫这一切好起来

我已经厌倦这些争斗了
I am so sick of fighting

1793
01:51:01,670 --> 01:51:03,390
厌倦每个人的愚蠢
and everybody's stupidity

1794
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:05,790
盲目  还有愧疚感
and blindness and guilt trips.

1795
01:51:05,790 --> 01:51:07,490
你不能吃东西吗  那就别吃
You can't eat the food? Don't eat the food.

1796
01:51:07,490 --> 01:51:10,250
我不在乎  你随便吃  我不在乎
I don't care. Take your poison, I don't care.

1797
01:51:10,630 --> 01:51:11,960
吃鱼对你有好处
Fish is good for you.

1798

1802
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:23,220
怎么会有人想要喝牛奶呢
Why would anyone ever want any milk?

1803
01:51:23,220 --> 01:51:26,300
反正你骨头里有钙了
You might get some calcium in your bones!

1804
01:51:27,030 --> 01:51:28,480
你想死吗  菲利克斯
Do you wanna die, Felix?

1805
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:29,440
去死吧
Die!

1806
01:51:56,770 --> 01:51:59,550
求你别离开我  菲利克斯

如果市长不见我们

1833
01:52:46,820 --> 01:52:49,290

理事会已经投票过了  奈德

你们想让我退出吗
You'd let me quit?

1849
01:53:39,890 --> 01:53:42,050
大家让我向你宣读这个

01:53:58,260 --> 01:54:00,390
分享这封信

1854
01:54:01,940 --> 01:54:05,540
我们必须扼止你极度膨胀的自负
You are on a colossal ego trip we must curtail.

1855
01:54:06,810 --> 01:54:09,540
你反复将恐惧强加于我们

对我们来说是野蛮的

1857
01:54:13,420 --> 01:54:16,030
你利用男同志的死

1858
01:54:16,030 --> 01:54:19,850
在全美国的电视和出版物上大做文章

在解放多年之后
And after years of liberation,

1861
01:54:27,340 --> 01:54:30,380
是你再次将性变得肮脏
you helped make sex dirty again for us...

1862
01:54:31,080 --> 01:54:33,590
可怕  还被禁止
terrible and forbidden.

1863
01:54:34,780 --> 01:54:37,030
你比任何人
We are more angry at you

01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:40,080
都更让我们愤怒
than ever in our lives toward anyone.

我们认为你想领导我们

但是
Well...

01:55:43,860 --> 01:55:46,730
执行理事不在理事会里  你知道的
The executive director isn't on the board, you know that.

1878
01:55:46,730 --> 01:55:48,220
我无权投票
I don't have a vote.

1879
01:55:48,300 --> 01:55:49,910
我还能怎么做
What could... what could I have done?

1880
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:52,210
-你没有支持我  -你说错了
- You didn't support me. - That's not true.

1881
01:55:52,210 --> 01:55:53,470
你们就是一群送葬者
You're all nothing but undertakers.

1882
01:55:53,470 --> 01:55:55,530
这个组织就是个殡仪馆
This whole organization is a funeral parlor.

1883
01:55:55,530 --> 01:55:57,780
-奈德  -你们只会关心死人
- Ned... - All you do is take care of the dying.

1884
01:55:57,780 --> 01:56:00,210
谁来为生者争取生存的权利
Who's fighting so the living can go on living?

1885
01:56:00,220 --> 01:56:02,200
谁来管我的菲利克斯
Who's fighting for my Felix?

1886
01:56:02,200 --> 01:56:04,750
汤米  请到楼上来一下
Tommy. We need you upstairs.

1887
01:56:10,790 --> 01:56:14,500
我与马塞尔·普鲁斯特  沃尔特·惠特曼
I belong to a culture that includes Marcel Proust, Walt Whitman,

1888
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:16,970
田纳西·威廉斯  亚历山大大帝
Tennessee Williams, Alexander the Great,

1889
01:56:16,980 --> 01:56:19,470
以及不计其数的教皇和红衣主教一脉相承
so many popes and cardinals you wouldn't believe.

1890
01:56:19,870 --> 01:56:21,160
格林·贝雷特先生  你知道吗
Mr. Green Beret, did you know

1891
01:56:21,160 --> 01:56:23,180
促成二战胜利的
that it was an openly gay Englishman

1892
01:56:23,180 --> 01:56:25,330
是一位公开出柜的英国人
who's responsible for winning World War II?

1893
01:56:25,330 --> 01:56:26,600
他叫阿兰·图灵
His name's Alan Turing

1894
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:28,920
是他拦截了德国人的密码
and he cracked the Germans' Enigma code. 

1895
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:31,220
战争结束后他自杀了
After the war was over, he committed suicide

1896
01:56:31,220 --> 01:56:33,500
因为身为同志  他受到了无尽的歧视
because he was so hounded for being gay.

1897
01:56:33,970 --> 01:56:36,230
他们怎么不在学校里教教这些
Why didn't they teach any of that in schools?

1898
01:56:36,640 --> 01:56:40,960
能赢得二战  多亏了一名同性恋
A gay man is responsible for winning World War II!

1899
01:56:42,230 --> 01:56:44,270
要是他们这么做了  或许他就不会自杀
If they did, maybe he wouldn't have killed himself

1900
01:56:44,270 --> 01:56:46,650
你们也不会如此惧怕自己是个怎样的人
and you wouldn't be so terrified of who you are.

1901
01:56:50,740 --> 01:56:52,760
我想这样被大家记住
That's how I want to be remembered.

1902
01:56:53,900 --> 01:56:55,670
带领大家赢得战争的人
As one of the men who won the war.

1903
01:56:59,970 --> 01:57:03,560
布鲁斯  我知道我是个混蛋
Bruce, I know that I am an asshole.

1904
01:57:03,910 --> 01:57:06,080
但请别赶我走
But please don't shut me out.

1905
01:57:44,170 --> 01:57:45,140
去吧
Go.

1906
01:58:00,220 --> 01:58:02,060
我是你弟弟的恋人
Your brother and I are lovers.

1907
01:58:04,190 --> 01:58:06,710
我快死了  想立份遗嘱
I'm dying and I need to make a will.

1908
01:58:09,660 --> 01:58:11,000
-请坐  -谢谢
- Please. - Thank you.

1909
01:58:25,110 --> 01:58:27,950
我想把所有东西都留给奈德
I want to leave everything to Ned.

1910
01:58:31,060 --> 01:58:32,210
我弟弟好吗
How's my brother?

1911
01:58:32,280 --> 01:58:35,300
从我一个人的病  到全世界的危机
Well, he blames himself for everything

1912
01:58:35,300 --> 01:58:39,930
他都觉得是自己的错
from my dying to the state of the entire world.

1913
01:58:40,570 --> 01:58:43,440
还有你俩仍然互不搭理对方
All that plus you two still not talking.

1914
01:58:46,230 --> 01:58:48,570
你一定和他一样固执
You must be as stubborn as he is.

1915
01:58:50,750 --> 01:58:52,420
我这就给他打电话
I'll call him right away.

1916
01:58:52,720 --> 01:58:55,500
好的  他在家收拾行李
Do. He's at home packing.

1917
01:58:55,500 --> 01:58:58,860
我们过几天要去耶鲁大学
We're going to Yale in a few days.

1918
01:58:59,420 --> 01:59:00,650
参加同志周
For Gay Week.

1919
01:59:02,300 --> 01:59:04,040
他说他自己都不敢相信这一切
He says he can't believe it.

1920
01:59:06,480 --> 01:59:09,270
他刚进校的时候差点想自杀
He tried to kill himself there when he was a freshman.

1921
01:59:14,820 --> 01:59:16,240
我没有太多...
I haven't much...

1922
01:59:18,640 --> 01:59:21,070
除了在韦尔弗利特海角上的
except for a beautiful piece of land

1923
01:59:21,470 --> 01:59:23,700
有一块美丽的土地
on the Cape in Wellfleet.

1924
01:59:25,410 --> 01:59:26,920
奈德不知道这事
Ned doesn't know about it.

1925
01:59:28,150 --> 01:59:29,920
这本来是个惊喜
It was to have been a surprise

1926
01:59:30,080 --> 01:59:32,010
我们一起远离喧嚣
for when we lived there together

1927
01:59:32,010 --> 01:59:35,670
从此在那里幸福快乐地生活下去
or riding away happily ever after.

1928
01:59:36,720 --> 01:59:40,100
我还有份保单
I also have an insurance policy,

1929
01:59:40,100 --> 01:59:43,180
跟《时报》签的  我是《纽约时报》的
uh... with the "Times." I'm a reporter...

1930
01:59:43,180 --> 01:59:45,140
一名记者
for "The New York Times."

1931
01:59:45,170 --> 01:59:47,680
这本来是要给我的亲属的
It's meant to come to my next of kin.

1932
01:59:48,750 --> 01:59:50,750
我怕他们不会把钱给他
I'm afraid they might not give it to him.

1933
01:59:50,750 --> 01:59:52,880
要是把他列为受益人  就必须这么办
Well, if he's listed as a beneficiary, they must.

1934
01:59:52,890 --> 01:59:55,260
你聪明得很  别想得那么天真
You're smarter than that. Don't be so naive.

1935
01:59:55,260 --> 01:59:58,790
我保证  我会努力确保他们照做的
I assure you, I will fight to make sure that they do.

1936
02:00:01,980 --> 02:00:03,700
就等你这句话呢
I was hoping you'd say that.

1937
02:00:12,740 --> 02:00:13,910
菲利克斯...
Felix...

1938
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:18,130
真希望我们能早点见面
I wish we'd met sooner.

1939
02:01:14,570 --> 02:01:17,170
我该穿白色的衣服
I should be wearing something white.

1940
02:01:17,170 --> 02:01:18,520
你穿着呢  亲爱的
You are, honey.

1941
02:01:20,160 --> 02:01:22,390
应该...应该是派瑞·艾力斯
It should... it should be something

1942
02:01:22,630 --> 02:01:27,160
为我量身定做的
Perry Ellis ran up for me personally.

1943
02:01:34,440 --> 02:01:35,590
奈德
Ned?

1944
02:01:41,100 --> 02:01:43,210
你想办法再去争取
You find a way to fight again.

1945
02:01:45,860 --> 02:01:47,010
我会的
I will.

1946
02:02:06,640 --> 02:02:08,820

Emma. Emma...?

1947
02:02:09,070 --> 02:02:12,620

Could we... could we start now, please?

1948

"We are gathered here in the sight of God

1949
02:02:24,810 --> 02:02:26,610
来见证这两位男人的结合
to join together these two men.

1950
02:02:28,040 --> 02:02:32,120
他们深爱对方...
They love each other very much and...

1951
02:02:32,670 --> 02:02:35,550
想在亲友面前
want to be married in the presence of their family

1952
02:02:35,590 --> 02:02:36,780
永结同心

I see no objection.
