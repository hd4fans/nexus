AMC台《行尸走肉》前情提要
Previously on the AMC's The Walking Dead...

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,100
我们赶走了他们
We drove them out.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,300
我们应该乘胜追击
We should go after them.

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,700
我们应该做个了断
We should finish it.

5
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:10,180
你们如何活着  如何死去
How you live... how you die--

6
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,480
不是我说了算
it isn't up to me.

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,880
大家投票决定
We vote.

8
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,070
他开枪打死了那个孩子
He gunned that kid down.

9
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,950
我逼不得已才那么做
I did what I had to do.

10
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:19,890
我们都被感染了
We're all infected.

11
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:20,900
如果我杀死你
If I was to kill you,

12
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,400
你就会变成这种东西
you'd come back as one of these things.

13
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,290
总督人呢
Where's the Governor?

14
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,890
他见人就开枪
He fired on everyone.

15
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,010
把大家都杀光了
Killed them all.

16
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,170
他们会耍花招的
They're gonna drew on us.

行尸走肉  第四季第一集

27
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,560
你没叫醒我
You didn't wake me up.

28
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,760
因为我知道你整晚没睡
'Cause I knew you were up all night

29
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,620
一直在用手电筒看漫画
reading comics with a flashlight.

30
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,020
维奥莉特怎么了
What's up with Violet?

31
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,700
卡尔  我告诉过你别给它们取名字
Carl, I told you not to name them.

32
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,440
它们不再是小猪了  而是食物
They're not piglets anymore. They're food.

33
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,180
我只是觉得  直到...
I just thought, you know, until...

34
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:18,940
好吧
Okay.

35
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,000
我不知道她怎么了
I don't know what's going on with her.

36
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,730
可能生病了  也可能没事
Could be sick, could be nothing.

37
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,610
早日康复  维奥莉特
Feel better, Violet.

38
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,250
走  我们去忙吧
Come on, let's get to it.

39
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,130
早上好  达里尔
Morning, Daryl.

40
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,300
好啊  S医生
What's up, Dr. S?

41
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,810
-早上好  达里尔  -早上好  达里尔
- Morning, Daryl. - Morning, Daryl.

42
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,700
好啊  达里尔
Hey, Daryl!

43
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,750
闻起来挺香的
Smells good.

44
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,710
记住啊  是我先喜欢你的
Just so you know, I liked you first.

45
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,700
打住
Stop.

46
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,550
瑞克也带了很多人回来
You know, Rick brought in a lot of them, too.

47
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,030
最近没有
Not recently.

48
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,270
庇护陌生人
Give the stranger sanctuary,

49
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,980
给他们吃的
keeping people fed,

50
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,140
你得学会宽容的生活
you're gonna have to learn to live with the love.

51
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,000
是啊
Right.

52
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,690
我带你去看样东西
I need you to see something.

53
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,140
帕特里克  你能来接手吗
Patrick, you want to take over?

54
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,350
好  女士
Yes, ma'am.

55
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:11,850
迪克森先生
Mr. Dixon,

56
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,750
我只想感谢你昨天带回了那头鹿
I just wanted to thank you for bringing that deer back yesterday.

57
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,750
我们真是大饱口福  先生
It was a real treat, sir.

58
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,030
如果能和你握手  我将倍感荣幸
And I'd be honored to shake your hand.

59
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,840
今天  不知道我们这边能否
About today, I don't know if we're gonna be able

60
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,800
分出人进城
to spare a lot of people for the run.

61
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,890
那个地方已经清空了  我们会继续推进
That place is good to go. We're gonna move on it.

62
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:19,930
是啊
Yeah.

63
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,820
问题是  一夜之间行尸暴增
The thing is, we had a pretty big buildup overnight.

64
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,600
三号塔那边更多
Dozens more towards tower three.

65
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,120
情况和上个月一样糟
It's getting as bad as last month.

66
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,730
它们不再分散了 
They don't spread out anymore.

67
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,440
人越多  就会吸引越多的行尸
With more of us sitting here, we're drawing more of them out.

68
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,150
很多行尸
You get enough of those

69
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,370
趴在围栏边  然后越聚越多
damn fence-clingers, they start to herd up.

70
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,330
又来推围墙了
Pushing against the fences again.

71
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,190
还撑得住  但得尽快行动  不然坚持不久 
It's manageable, but unless we get ahead of it, not for long.

72
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,290
要辛苦你了  宝贝儿
Sorry, Pookie.

73
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,000
喜欢那样吧
You like that?

74
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,020
我觉得你今天还是别去了
I don't think you should go today.

75
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,350
真的吗
Really?

76
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,450
真的
Yeah.

77
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,110
我们有防爆服
We have the suits.

78
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,740
但你不用去
Yeah, but you don't have to go.

79
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,310
你不应该去
You shouldn't.

80
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,960
你知道一切都会好的  对吧
You know everything's gonna work out, right?

81
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:56,490
对吧
Right?

82
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,170
对
Right.

83
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,650
对
Right.

84
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,490
但你得留下  行吗
But you're staying, okay?

85
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,290
好吧
Fine.

86
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,150
你好  美女
Hey, beautiful.

87
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,690
你也好
Hey yourself.

88
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,470
-去穿个围裙  -好
- You need an apron. - Yeah.

89
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,800
能和你谈谈吗
Listen, can we talk?

90
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,150
我打算今天跟他们出去
I was thinking of going on the run today.

91
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:29,590
行啊
Okay.

92
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,770
我不喜欢隔着围栏爆它们的头
I don't like killing them on the fence.

93
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,420
讨厌的很
I hate it.

94
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,430
而在外面  它们向着你走过来
I mean, when they're coming at you out there,

95
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:38,550
那是不同的
it's different.

96
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,090
你想都不用想
You don't even think about it.

97
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,770
当它们层层趴在围栏上时
When they're stacked up against the chain-link,

98
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,890
面对面  我...
you're just face-to-face. I...

99
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,340
我只是想做点别的来帮忙
I just wanted to do something different to help out.

100
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,930
可你总是自告奋勇来做这事
You always volunteered to do it.

101
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,410
那是因为你总是在做
That's because you were always doing it.

102
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,160
我想多点机会了解你
Just thought I could get to know you.

103
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:11,960
你做到了
You did.

104
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,760
在外面小心点
You be careful out there.

105
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,650
我正想找你
I was just gonna come find you.

106
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,840
找我什么事
What's up?

107
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,910
委员会把大家从煤炭小队撤回来
Well, the council pulled back everyone on the coal crew

108
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,570
准备组织外出
from going on the run.

109
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,540
他们现在缺人手
They're shorthanded right now.

110
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,230
我觉得应该加入他们
I figured I'd step up to help, go with 'em.

111
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,590
只是想在走之前见你一面
Just, you know, wanted to make sure that I saw you before.

112
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,600
好吧
Okay.

113
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,750
我只是... 你知道的
I just-- 'cause, you know,

114
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,040
出去很危险
it's dangerous going out there.

115
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,020
我知道
I know.

116
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,030
好吧  那不跟我道别吗
Okay, are you gonna say good-bye?

117
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:04,970
才不呢
Nope.

118
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,860
整的跟言情小说似的
It's like a damn romance novel.

119
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,570
我想跟你们一起去
I'd like to start pulling my weight around here.

120
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,860
鲍勃  这才过了一周
Bob, it's only been a week.

121
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,430
这一周我能吃上饭
That's a week worth of meals,

122
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,140
有个安身之处
a roof over my head.

123
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,630
让我也发光发热好继续待在这里
Let me earn my keep.

124
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,940
-达里尔找到你时  你孤身一人  -是的
- You were out on your own when Daryl found you. - That's right.

125
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,530
我想知道  你会团队作战吗
I just want to make sure you know how to play on a team.

126
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,320
如果很困难  我们也不会去
We ain't gonna do it unless it's easy.

127
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,170
他可是军医
You know he was a medic in the Army.

128
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,510
你还真是难搞定  你知道吗
You a hell of a tough sell. You know that?

129
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,130
好吧
Okay.

130
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:56,050
这些叶子都会长在背阳处
These leaves are gonna be in the shade,

131
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,500
因此长不出什么好果子
so we won't get any good fruit from it.

132
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,670
所以我们就把它从这里掐断
So we just pinch it off here.

133
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,460
根茎断了  但它们还能生长
Things break, but they can still grow.

134
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,310
这些小枝  它们会扎根
These little bristles, they'll take root

135
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,210
然后我们就会有棵全新的植物了
and we'll have a whole new plant.

136
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,100
走吧
Let's go.

137
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,670
见到你我们真开心
We're glad to see you.

138
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,230
见到你们我也很开心
Glad to see you, too.

139
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,090
有人中头彩了
Somebody hit the jackpot.

140
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,700
不可能吧
No way.

141
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,410
太棒了  谢谢
Awesome! Thank you.

142
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,940
你看完了轮我看
I get to read 'em when you're done.

143
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,100
我还找到了这个
And I found this.

144
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,330
你脸上一片狼藉
Your face is losing the war.

145
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,820
你要待一段时间吗
You gonna stay a little while?

146
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,540
就待一会儿
Just a little while.

147
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,220
看看谁回来了
Well, look who's back.

148
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,360
我没找到他
Didn't find him.

149
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,910
真高兴看到你安全归来
Glad to see you in one piece.

150
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,980
我寻思着要在梅肯附近找找
I'm thinking of looking over near Macon.

151
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,400
这值得一试
It's worth a shot.

152
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,230
七十里路满是行尸
70 miles of walkers.

153
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,860
你有可能碰上几个不太友好的
You might run into a few unneighborly types.

154
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:46,780
不是吗
Is it?

155
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,280
我去看看基地
I'm gonna go check out the Big Spot.

156
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,830
我之前说过的那个  就去看看
The one I was talking about, just seeing.

157
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,440
是啊  我得出去检查一下陷阱
Yeah, I got to go out and check the snares.

158
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,050
我可不想把我们抓到的东西白白让给行尸
I don't want to lose whatever we catch to the walkers.

159
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,400
我去吧
I'll go.

160
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,190
你刚到这呢
You just got here.

161
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,270
我会回来的
And I'll be back.

162
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,410
-你要去检查陷阱  -是的
- Going to check the snares? - I am.

163
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,960
你不能去  去做你的杂事
You're not. Do your chores.

164
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,480
看你的漫画  或者读几本书
Read comics. Maybe some books, too.

165
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,250
去找帕特里克玩
Hang out with Patrick.

166
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,620
也许去参加故事会
Maybe go to story time.

167
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,140
老爸  那是小孩干的事
Dad, that's for kids.

168
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:37,380
是呀
Yeah.

169
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,060
现在  刷刷她
Now brush her down.

170
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,730
留在这里没什么不对的  瑞克
Nothing wrong with staying close, Rick.

171
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,740
每个人都能理解
Everyone understands.

172
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,700
你为我们种了足够的庄稼
You're growing us enough food

173
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,740
近期内你不用再四处奔波了
so we won't need to do runs soon.

174
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,100
但我们得给你找一套好点的连体工服了
But we do have to find you a good pair of overalls.

175
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,330
你看上去得像点样
You need to look the part.

176
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,960
嘴角上叼一株小麦
A little piece of wheat out of the corner of your mouth.

177
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,980
再长个农夫大臀
Maybe a bigger ass.

178
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,660
听着  委员会里其余的人
Listen, the rest of the council--

179
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,790
达里尔  格伦  卡萝尔  萨沙
Daryl, Glenn, Carol, Sasha,

180
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,620
他们所有人
all of them--

181
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,460
他们都想要我和你谈谈
they wanted me to talk to you.

182
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,610
当你出去的时候
When you go out there,

183
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,840
你必须得带上你的枪
you got to take your gun.

184
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,030
别担心
Easy now.

185
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,810
只不过是去围栏外
It's just outside the fence.

186
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,330
我带着我的刀呢
I have my knife.

187
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:38,430
我遇到麻烦的话  六发子弹也没什么用
I get in trouble, six bullets isn't gonna make the difference.

188
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:42,130
瑞克  我们不想让你出事
Rick, we want you to be safe.

189
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,840
带着你的枪
Bring your gun.

190
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,340
等等
Wait.

191
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,180
求你了
Please.

192
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,850
求你
Please?

193
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,410
求你帮帮我
Please help me.

194
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,820
我知道你不认识我
I know you don't know me.

195
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,000
好吗  我知道
Okay, I know that.

196
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:02,180
但是你能帮我把这个带给我丈夫吗
But can you please help me get this to my husband?

197
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,550
我们已经好几天没吃饭了
We haven't eaten in days.

198
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,670
给你  拿着
Here. Go ahead.

199
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,080
谢谢
Thank you.

200
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:53,460
你在这附近有营地吗
Do you have a camp around here?

201
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,900
有
Yeah.

202
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,670
我们能不能跟你回去
Could we possibly come back with you?

203
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:07,170
我们自己
We've been doing...

204
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,740
很难熬
very badly on our own.

205
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,850
我得见见他
I'd have to meet him.

206
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,960
我要问他几个问题  问你们俩
I need to ask him some questions, both of you.

207
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,010
什么问题
What questions?

208
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,490
就问三个
Just three.

209
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,650
我们到了再说
When we get there.

210
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,740
你身上有枪吗
You have a gun on you?

211
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,870
我能确认一下吗
Can I make sure?

212
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,900
好
Yeah.

213
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,150
我不认识你
Look, I don't know you,

214
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,990
所以我警告你
so I'm just gonna tell you this.

215
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,390
你要是跟我耍花招
You try anything--

216
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,400
任何花招
anything--

217
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:08,870
输的人会是你
you're gonna be the one who loses.

218
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,870
我已经一无所有了
I don't have anything else to lose.

219
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,610
不
No.

220
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,520
你有
You do.

221
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,190
拿着
Go ahead.

222
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,100
尼克  看这边
Nick, look over here.

223
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,260
这是维恩
This one's Wayne.

224
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,100
-尼克  -尼克  看这边
- Nick. - Nick, over here.

225
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,420
嗨  尼克
Hi, Nick!

226
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,950
-嗨  尼克  -你们给它们起名字了
- Hi, Nick. - You're naming them?

227
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,950
有一个行尸有名牌
Well, one of them has a name tag,

228
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,440
我们就觉得它们都应该有名字
so we thought all of them should.

229
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,110
它们活着的时候有名字  它们已经死了
They had names when they were alive. They're dead now.

230
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,840
不  它们没死  只是不一样了
No, they're not. They're just different.

231
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,040
你到底在说什么
What the hell are you talking about?

232
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,290
它们不能说话
Okay, they don't talk.

233
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:02,290
不能思考  它们吃人
They don't think. They eat people.

234
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,450
它们杀人
They kill people.

235
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,790
普通人也杀人  但他们还是有名字
People kill people. They still have names.

236
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,380
你们见过发生的事吗
Have you seen what happens?

237
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,670
你们见过有人那样死去的情景吗
Have you seen someone die like that?

238
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,510
是的  见过
Yeah, I have.

239
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,520
它们不是人  也不是宠物
They're not people and they're not pets.

240
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,820
别给它们起名字
Don't name them.

241
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,600
我们应该去看书  走吧
We're supposed to go read. Come on.

242
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,530
你今晚参加故事会吗
You coming to story time tonight?

243
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,110
好
Uh, yeah.

244
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:33,600
到时见
See you then.

245
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,980
我有时参加  我很幼稚
I go sometimes. I'm immature.

246
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,060
你不会喜欢的  是小孩的游戏
You wouldn't dig it. It's for kids.

247
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,660
我也走了
I'm gonna head up there, too.

248
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,410
一会儿再聊  小长官
I'll catch you later, young sir.

249
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,330
好
Yep.

250
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,790
军队来后竖起了这些围栏
Army came in and put these fences up.

251
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,870
建了一个避难基地
Made it a place for the people to go.

252
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,930
上周我们发现这个地方的时候
Last week when we spotted this place,

253
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:58,490
铁丝网后面有很多行尸
there was a bunch of walkers behind this chain-link

254
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,960
就像看门狗一样不让人进去
keeping people out like a bunch of guard dogs.

255
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,920
它们都离开了吗
So they all just left?

256
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,340
你听
Give a listen.

257
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,520
你把它们引走了
You drew 'em out.

258
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,650
三天前放了一个录音机在那儿
Put a boom box out there three days ago.

259
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,680
接在两块车用蓄电池上
Hooked it up to two car batteries.

260
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:17,450
好吧  我们来扫荡吧
All right, let's make a sweep.

261
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,140
注意安全  尽量多拿
Make sure it's safe. Grab what you can.

262
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,930
明天我们带更多的人过来
We'll come back tomorrow with more people.

263
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,290
来吧
Come on.

264
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,180
等一下
Just give it a second.

265
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,170
好吧  我觉得我明白了
Okay, I think I got it.

266
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,600
明白什么
Got what?

267
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,180
我一直想知道达里尔以前是干什么的
I've been trying to guess what Daryl did before the turn.

268
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,060
他已经瞎猜了差不多六个星期了
He's been trying to guess for, like, six weeks.

269
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,930
我在慢慢猜
Yeah, I'm pacing myself.

270
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,460
每天试一次
One shot a day.

271
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,980
好吧  说说看
All right, shoot.

272
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,320
你在监狱里的行为方式
Well, the way you are at the prison,

273
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,230
你是委员会成员  你会追踪
you being on the council, you're able to track,

274
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,430
你帮助人们  但是你还是有点
you're helping people, but you're still being kind of...

275
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:23,860
阴沉
surly.

276
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,100
然后我就懂了
Big swing here.

277
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,590
你是凶案警察
Homicide cop.

278
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,280
有什么好笑的
What's so funny?

279
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,980
没什么  相当说得通
Nothing. It makes perfect sense.

280
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,390
其实这家伙说的没错
Actually, the man's right.

281
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,690
我是卧底警察
Undercover.

282
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:46,220
-不会吧  真的吗  -真的
- Come on, really? - Yep.

283
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,990
我不喜欢谈论这个
I don't like to talk about it

284
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:51,030
因为真的挺操蛋的  你懂吗
'cause it was a lot of heavy shit, you know?

285
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,860
伙计  可别骗我  真的吗
Dude, come on, really?

286
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,470
好吧  看来我得接着猜了
Okay. I'll just keep guessing, I guess.

287
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,200
没错  接着猜吧
Yeah, you keep doing that.

288
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,580
-我们要开始吗  探长  -干吧
- We're gonna do this, Detective? - Let's do it.

289
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,350
好吧  我们进去  扫荡时保持队形
All right, we go in, stay in formation for the sweep.

290
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,220
你们都知道该找什么
After that, you all know what you're supposed to look for.

291
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,360
还有问题吗
Any questions?

292
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,400
我有没有没被你使唤过
Was there ever a time that you weren't the boss of me?

293
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,900
我出生之前有那么几年吧
You had a few years before I was born.

294
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:08,600
我们当时准备去巴亚尔塔港度蜜月
We were going to Puerto Vallarta for our honeymoon.

295
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:11,990
他们关闭了机场
When they shut down the airports,

296
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:15,290
我们的转接航班再也没出现
our connecting flight never connected.

297
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,520
我们不许离开航站楼  所以
They wouldn't let us leave the terminal, so...

298
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:24,300
我们就睡在
we slept next to these huge

299
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,370
来自津巴布韦的巨型大理石雕塑边
marble sculptures from Zimbabwe.

300
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:32,070
第四天夜里
Then, on the fourth night,

301
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:35,570
那些东西就进来了
the things just came through.

302
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,250
一开始我们有很多人
There were a lot of us and...

303
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,080
但现在只剩下埃迪和我了
now it's just Eddie and me.

304
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,970
如果不是因为他
And I wouldn't have made it

305
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,860
我根本挺不过来
if it wasn't for him.

306
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,460
如果不是因为
And it isn't that...

307
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:57,600
他一次又一次地救了我
he saved me over and over again

308
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,230
或者让我明白
or that he showed me the things

309
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:03,440
有些事不得不做  或者
that I had to do or...

310
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,470
应该主动去做
to be willing to do.

311
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,280
要不是因为他还在这里
If he wasn't still here...

312
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,480
我  我也早就完了
I-- I couldn't be.

313
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:17,390
我就是  我做不到
I just-- I couldn't.

314
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,920
你指什么事
What were they?

315
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,450
什么
What?

316
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:27,030
那些你不得不主动去做的事
The things you had to be willing to do?

317
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:32,230
吃我们能找到的任何食物
Eeating whatever we could find--

318
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,530
动物尸体
animal carcasses

319
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,350
腐烂的水果  还有
and rotten fruit-- and...

320
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,980
抛弃其他人
leaving people behind.

321
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,080
躲开那些需要援助的人
Hiding from people who needed my help.

322
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,120
你就不一样
Unlike you.

323
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,330
我也不是做慈善的
This is not charity.

324
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,990
人必须集体行动
You have to have numbers.

325
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:02,830
人是对抗行尸的最好武器
People are the best defense against walkers

326
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,960
或者对抗其他人
or people.

327
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,730
我们互相帮助
We help each other.

328
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,340
你管它们叫"行尸"
You call them "Walkers"?

329
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,040
你还好吧  有受伤吗
You all right? You cut or something?

330
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,210
没有  但我的脚被压住了
No, man, but my foot is caught.

331
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:11,080
好的  他被压住了  来帮我一把
All right. He's just caught. Come on, help me up.

332
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,320
-出什么事了  -大家都没事
- What happened? - Everyone's all right.

333
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,890
只是被红酒和啤酒淹没了
We're over in wine and beer.

334
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,100
我动作可快了  伙计  直接冲向酒瓶
I was moving fast, man. I drove right into the drinks.

335
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,410
伙计  是你运气好
Man, you lucked out.

336
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:27,520
这东西要是再偏一点...
If this thing had come down on you the wrong way...

337
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,580
我们该走了
Yeah, uh, we should probably go now.

338
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,310
鲍勃还被压着  把他弄出来
Bob's still stuck. Get him out of there.

339
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,980
我们去找其他人
We'll get the others.

340
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,580
我曾在机场看过那些雕塑
I saw those sculptures at the airport once.

341
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:18,930
我最喜欢孩子玩跳背游戏的那尊
My favorite was the kids playing leapfrog.

342
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,900
我也是
Mine, too.

343
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:27,760
埃迪和我不得不做的那些事
What Eddie and I had to do,

344
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,330
你也做过吗
did you do things like that?

345
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,560
做过吗
Did you?

346
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,900
你觉得做过那些事后  还能回到过去吗
Do you think you get to come back from them?

347
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:47,410
我希望如此
I hope so.

348
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:49,110
是吗
Yeah?

349
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:51,950
希望我们对你三个问题的回答
I hope we answer your three questions

350
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,950
能让你们满意
to your satisfaction.

351
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:41,990
达里尔  快走
Daryl, go!

352
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:00,340
把鲍勃弄出来
Let's get Bob.

353
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:09,330
再挪一点
More, more.

354
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,900
快  必须得走了
Come on, time to go.

355
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,770
走吧  快走  快
Let's go, now! Come on! Go!

356
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,860
扎克
Zack!

357
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:30,770
走吧  快走
Go, go!

358
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,010
就在前面了[双关]
It's just ahead.

359
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,300
埃迪
Eddie.

360
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,640
谢天谢地你还在这里
Oh, thank God you're still here.

361
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:51,220
他是瑞克
This is Rick.

362
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,210
他会帮助我们
He's gonna help us.

363
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:58,020
一切都会好的
Everything's gonna be okay.

364
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,790
一切
Everything--

365
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,960
可恶
Damn it!

366
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:18,060
我本来想把野猪带回来
I wanted to take the boar.

367
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:21,860
可我知道带你过来会更快
I just knew-- I knew I'd get you here so much quicker.

368
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:26,090
他饿坏了
He's starving.

369
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:29,660
他越来越蔫  他需要吃活物
He's slowing. He needs something alive.

370
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,830
求你  我说过  我不能没有他
Please, I told you, I can't be without him.

371
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:43,520
所以我才留着他
And so I kept him.

372
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,080
这是错的
It was wrong.

373
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:51,090
我不能做这种事
I can't do things like this.

374
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:56,420
但你必须这样做
And-- and you have to do things like this.

375
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,360
让我和他一样吧
Let me be like him.

376
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:00,110
不要阻拦
Don't stop it.

377
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:02,830
不要在这之后杀掉我们
Don't end it after.

378
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:05,760
-不  -让我同他在一起吧
- No. - Let me be with him.

379
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,550
不要
No!

380
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,820
你的...
What were...

381
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,850
问题是什么
the questions?

382
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:52,310
那三个问题
The three questions?

383
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:57,010
你杀过多少行尸
How many walkers have you killed?

384
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,550
埃迪
Eddie--

385
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,860
埃迪把它们都杀了
Eddie killed-- killed them all.

386
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,530
直到...
Until...

387
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:17,730
你杀过多少活人
How many people have you killed?

388
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,390
只有我自己
Just me.

389
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,790
只有我自己
Just me.

390
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,680
为什么
Why?

391
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,420
你没法
You don't--

392
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:47,260
你没法回到过去
you don't get to come back.

393
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,190
有些事一旦发生  你就没法
You don't get to come back

394
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:54,880
回到过去
from things.

395
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,750
回不去...
You don't...

396
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:41,800
"孩子们盯着蜡烛
The children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle

397
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:45,530
看着它缓缓地  无情地融化
and watched it melt slowly and pitilessly away.

398
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:49,310
最后只剩半寸孤独的灯芯
Saw the half inch of wick stand alone at last.

399
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:52,320
微弱的火苗忽上忽下
Saw the feeble flame rise and fall.

400
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,150
顺着轻烟而上
Climb the thin tower of smoke.

401
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,360
徘徊片刻  之后..."
Linger at its top a moment and then..."

402
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,060
女士  我该去放哨了吗
Ma'am, should I take watch now?

403
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,830
好的  卢克  去吧
Yes, Luke, you do that.

404
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,290
今天
Today...

405
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:15,020
我们来学习刀具的用法
We are talking about knives-- how to use them,

406
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,610
如何安全地使用  如何用它们救命
how to be safe with them, and how they could save your life.

407
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,500
女士  我能先走吗
Ma'am, may I be dismissed?

408
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:22,440
-怎么  -我不太舒服
- What is it? - I'm not feeling very well.

409
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,660
有时你要克服一下
Sometimes you're gonna have to fight through it.

410
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,260
万一你独自在外怎么办
What if you wind up out there alone?

411
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,820
因为不舒服就放弃自己吗
You just give up because you're feeling bad?

412
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:34,560
不  我只是不想吐在别人身上
No, it's just I don't want to yack on somebody.

413
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:37,800
去吧
Go.

414
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:45,470
好  今天我们学习如何握刀
Okay, today we're gonna learn how to hold a knife,

415
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:49,840
怎么砍刺  该瞄准哪里
how to stab and slash and where to aim for.

416
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,140
拜托  不要告诉你父亲
Please, don't tell your father.

417
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,380
怎么了
What?

418
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,710
我也不想去外面
I don't like going out there, either.

419
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,520
达里尔会告诉贝丝
Daryl's telling Beth.

420
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:22,390
这是没办法的事
There's nothing else to do.

421
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,120
我去找她
I'll go see her.

422
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,110
我没怀孕
I'm not pregnant.

423
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,560
-你知道了吗  -知道了
- You know? - I know.

424
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:39,970
天啊
Oh, my God.

425
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:44,000
我没打算要孩子  但我们可以要
I didn't want to, but we could have.

426
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,710
我们可以在这里生活
We can have lives here.

427
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,370
经历了洛莉和今天的事
How can you say that after today?

428
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,290
你怎能还这么说
After Lori?

429
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:56,280
因为我不想害怕活着
Because I don't want to be afraid of being alive.

430
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,470
会害怕才让我们活到了今天
Being afraid is what's kept us alive.

431
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:05,300
不是
No.

432
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:08,130
我们这只是苟延残喘
It's how we kept breathing.

433
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,430
-嗨  -嗨
-Hey.  -Hi.

434
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,380
怎么了
What is it?

435
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,780
扎克
Zack.

436
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,120
他死了吗
Is he dead?

437
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:43,940
噢
Okay.

438
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:04,810
30天无事故

439
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:05,930
怎么
What?

440
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,900
我再也不会哭了
I don't cry anymore, Daryl.

441
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,100
我只是觉得很高兴认识了他
I'm just glad I got to know him, you know?

442
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,920
我也是
Me, too.

443
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:25,500
你还好吧
Are you okay?

444
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:30,500
只是厌倦了同伴的离去
Just tired of losing people is all.

445
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,650
我很庆幸没有跟他道别
I'm glad I didn't say good-bye.

446
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,940
我讨厌道别
I hate good-byes.

447
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,550
我也是
Me, too.

448
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,000
梅肯

449
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:06,020
你试图帮她
You tried to help her.

450
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:09,040
你帮不了  没人帮得了
You couldn't. No one could.

451
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,650
有些人已经病入膏肓
Some people are too far gone.

452
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,890
而你没有
You're not.

453
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,640
你试图帮她
You tried to help her.

454
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,760
那个女人的状态
How that woman wound up,

455
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,030
我也差点成那样
I got close to that.

456
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,190
如果我失去了卡尔和朱迪思
If I lost Carl and Judith,

457
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,350
失去这个地方
if I lost this place--

458
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:28,640
不会的  瑞克  即使那样也不会
Not then, Rick. Not even then.

459
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,390
你回来了
You came back.

460
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,220
你的儿子回来了
Your boy came back.

461
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,770
你一定不会迷失
You get to come back. You do.

462
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:47,630
现代汽车为您带来《行尸走肉》下集预告
Hyundai presents this seaon on The Walking Dead...

463
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,650

464
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:50,750
我们必须维持这里运作
We have to keep this place going.

465
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:53,380
-瑞克  -快跑  离开这里
- Rick! - Go! Get out of here.

466
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:55,980
我们的人所剩无几了
There's not a lot of us left.

467
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:59,770
除非必要  不要开枪
You don't fire unless you absolutely need to.

468
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,620
我不能让你这么做
I can't let you do this.

469
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,220
别拦我
Don't stop me!

470
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:07,310
你为什么还在找总督
The Governor. Why you still looking for him?

471
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:10,880
要么开枪  要么跑
You shoot or you run.

472
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:12,840
左转
Go to the left.

473
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:14,220
卡住了
Jammed up.

00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:18,440
