He was murdered by three vagrants whose motive was simple robbery.

00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:53,803

00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:18,202
里诺报报道 1983年6月
As reported in the Reno Gazette, June of 1983...

15
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,455
发生了一场火灾
...there is the story of a fire...

16
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:24,083
在泼下的灭火的水中发现了一具尸体
...the water that it took to contain the fire...

17
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:27,837
他叫德尔默・达里恩 是一名潜水爱好者
...and a scuba diver named Delmer Darion.

18
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:34,761
他在内华达州里诺市的金块旅馆及赌场工作
Employee of the Nugget Hotel and Casino, Reno, Nevada...

19
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,681
是二十一点的发牌手 然而真正让德尔默痴迷的是
...engaged as a blackjack dealer, well-liked and well-regarded...

20
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:42,185
在湖中潜水
...as a physical, recreational, and sporting sort...

21
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,854
这才是他喜爱的运动
...Delmer's true passion was for the lake.

22
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:58,701
根据验尸官的报告 德尔默因心脏病突发
As reported by the coroner, Delmer died of a heart attack...

23
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,329
死在湖与树林之间的某个地方
...somewhere between the lake and the tree...

24
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:05,917
是另外一件事情引起了人们的好奇 事发第二天 一名叫做克雷格・汉森的人自杀了
...but most curious side note is the suicide the next day of Craig Hansen...

25
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,128
他是志愿的救火员 当时他抛下自己可怜的四个孩子
...volunteer firefighter, estranged father of four...

26
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:13,132
正在酗酒 汉森是飞行员
...and a poor tendency to drink. Mr. Hansen was the pilot of the plane...

27
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,553
他的飞机匪夷所思地将德尔默・达里恩舀了起来
...that quite accidentally lifted Delmer Darion out of the water.

28
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:20,515
更加偶然的是 汉森在两天前的晚上
Added to this, Mr. Hansen's tortured life...

29
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:24,060
曾经和德尔默・达里恩打过交道
...met before with Delmer Darion just two nights previous.

30
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:25,686
我再要个2
All I need is a two.

31
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,397
你想要个两点 好吧
All you need is a deuce. All right.

32
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,107
这是个8
That is an eight.

33
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:34,153
没办法 这就是现实
Glad you like my work. All right. Moment of truth-

34
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:38,282
他的负罪感如此之强 如此之大 以致于
The weight of the guilt and the measure of coincidence so large...

35
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,660
克雷格・汉森因此选择了自杀
...Craig Hansen took his life.

36
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:48,084
对此 我无论如何 还是仅仅想将它看作是一个巧合
And I am trying to think this was all only a matter of chance.

37
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:51,379
1961年美国法医鉴定协会的颁奖晚宴上
The tale told at a 1961 awards dinner...

38
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:54,215
协会主席约翰・哈勃
...for the American Association of Forensic Science...

39
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:57,635
讲述了这样一个故事
...by Dr. John Harper, president of the association...

40
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:00,096
一个简单的企图自杀的故事
...began with a simple suicide attempt.

41
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:01,722
很惊奇吧
curiosity.

42
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,183
一个叫做希尼・巴林杰的十七岁男孩
Seventeen-year-old Sydney Barringer...

43
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:10,314
发生在洛杉矶市 1958年3月23号
...in the city of Los Angeles on March 23rd, 1958.

44
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,957
据验尸官事后说 这桩本不会成功的自杀
The coroner ruled that the unsuccessful suicide...

45
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:31,043
在一瞬间不幸地成功地变成一桩谋杀
...had suddenly become a successful homicide.

46
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,589
首先这本应是一桩自杀
To explain, the suicide was confirmed by a note...

47
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,800
证据是来自希尼・巴林杰口袋中的小纸条
...in the right hip pocket of Sydney Barringer.

48
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:42,179
就在小希尼站在楼台上同时
At the same time young Sydney stood on the ledge of this nine-story building...

49
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,974
三层以下正在爆发一场争吵
...an argument swelled three stories below.

50
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,979
当时邻居们都听见 这对房客夫妇又像往常一样吵架
The neighbors heard, as they usually did, the arguing of the tenants...

51
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:53,649
并且也像往常一样 手持猎枪威吓另外一个
...and it was not uncommon for them to threaten each other with a shotgun...

52
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,818
当然有时也会用手枪
...or one of the many handguns in the house.

53
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,486
我要打死你
I'm gonna put you down!

54
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,156
然而当她无意中抠下猎枪扳机时
And when the shotgun accidentally went off...

55
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:01,449
畜牲
You asshole!

56
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,869
希尼正巧掉了下来
Sydney just happened to pass.

57
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:06,162
什么?
What?

58
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,081
别他妈说话!
Shut the fuck up!

59
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,668
更巧的还在后面
Added to this, the two tenants turned out to be...

60
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,503
这两位房客分别是费伊和亚瑟・巴林杰
...Faye and Arthur Barringer...

61
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,673
希尼的父亲和母亲
...Sydney's mother and Sydney's father.

62
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,634
面对起诉
When confronted with the charge...

63
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:23,346
警方描述事情经过时
...which took some figuring out for the officers on the scene of the crime...

64
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,349
费伊・巴林杰发誓自己根本不知道猎枪里有子弹
...Faye Barringer swore she did not know the gun was loaded.

65
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,642
我不知道
I didn't know.

66
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:31,062
她经常这样威胁我 所以我从来不上子弹
She always threatens me with the gun, but I don't keep it loaded.

67
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,481
你从来不上子弹吗?
DETECTlVE: And you didn't load the gun?

68
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,358
我怎么可能上子弹哪?
Why would I load the gun?

69
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,610
一个住在这座楼里的
A boy who lived in the building...

70
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:40,404
经常和希尼・巴林杰在一起玩的小男孩
...sometimes a visitor and friend to Sydney Barringer...

71
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:44,450
告诉警方 他在六天前曾经看到 这把枪上了子弹
...said that he had seen, six days prior, the loading of the shotgun.

72
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,202
里基 过来一下
Ricky, come here a minute.

73
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,704
能看得出 这种无休止的争吵与厮打
lt seems that all the arguing and fighting...

74
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,874
无休止的家庭暴力 给希尼・巴林杰造成很大心理伤害
...and all of the violence was far too much for Sydney Barringer...

75
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:55,002
他知道父母还会继续下去
...and knowing his mother and father's tendency to fight...

76
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,629
于是他决定做些什么
...he decided to do something.

77
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,549
他说他想让他们杀了对方
He said that he wanted them to kill each other...

78
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,511
他们这么吵本来就是想杀了对方
...and that's all that they wanted to do, kill each other...

79
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:06,847
所以他就帮助他爸妈这么做啦
...and that he would help them do that if that's what they wanted.

80
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:10,726
希尼・巴林杰从九楼屋顶跳下
Sydney Barringer jumps from the ninth-floor rooftop.

81
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,354
他的父母正在六楼吵架
His parents argue three stories below.

82
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:16,482
母亲无意中按下扳机 正好打穿了希尼胃部
Her accidental shotgun blast hits Sydney in the stomach...

83
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,485
就在他掉落经过六楼窗户时
...as he passes the arguing sixth-floor window.

84
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,613
当场就被打死了 但他继续往下掉
He is killed instantly, but continues to fall...

85
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:27,451
然而就在二楼 有一个三天前装上的安全网
...only to find, five stories below, a safety net installed three days prior...

86
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,121
这个用来保护洗窗工人的网子 本可以截住救了他
...for window washers that would've broken his fall...

87
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:33,666
当然如果他胃上没被打出那个大洞的话
...and saved his life if not for the hole in his stomach.

88
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:37,211
他的母亲费伊・巴林杰被指控谋杀
So Faye Barringer was charged with the murder of her son...

89
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:40,798
小男孩自己则被控对自己的死 犯有协同罪
...and Sydney Barringer noted as an accomplice in his own death.

90
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,301
发言人简单地评述为
And it is in the humble opinion of this narrator...

91
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:47,430
这不是件普普通通的事儿
...that this is not just something that happened.

92
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:51,183
不是那种每时每刻发生着的事儿
This cannot be one of those things.

93
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,186
这事儿 拜托 当然和它们不同
This, please, cannot be that.

94
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,731
我想说 我不只这么认为
And for what I would like to say, I can't.

95
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:00,067
这不能简单地归于巧合
This was not just a matter of chance. Ha, ha.

96
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,071
而且这种听起来邪门的事 其实从来没有停止过
These strange things happen all the time.

97
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,271
在这个巨大的游戏中
ln this big game that we play, life, it's not what you hope for.

98
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,358
你的人生不会因为你的希望和等待而改变 你必须付诸于行动
It's not what you deserve. It's what you take.

99
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,487
我是弗兰克・T・J ・麦吉
I'm Frank T.J. Mackey, a master of the muffin...

...just dripping to wet your dock.

105
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,877
我们需要什么? 仅仅是语言
Bottom line? Language:

106
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:03,464
这是揭开女性底层心理的密匙

107
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,841
直接抓住她的思想
Tap directly into her hopes, her wants...

108
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:09,845
她的恐惧 她的欲望 和她那条可爱的小衬裤

你还能忍受多少次
Hey, how many more times...

115
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,658
听到那句无法忍受的回答

116
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:32,451
那么
So?

117

暴力如此猖獗

194
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,919
这不是什么轻松的工作
This is not an easy job.

195
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:57,299
首先我从接收器里收到中心的信息
I get a call on the radio from Dispatch.

196
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,385
一般是个坏消息
lt's bad news.

197
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,721
坏得发臭
And it stinks.

198
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:09,311
但这就是我的工作 不管怎样 我喜欢它
But this is my job, and I love it...

199
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,648
因为我想做得更好些

200
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:15,943
我想在这一生中 在这个世界上 我能努力做好我的事
ln this life and in this world, I wanna do well...

201
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:18,362
我想帮助别人

202
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,824
虽然我可能一天会接到20个这样的坏消息
And I might get 20 bad calls a day...

203
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:26,662
但总会让我抓住一次来帮助别人 救一个人
...but one time I can help someone, I make a save...

204
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:30,082
纠正一次错误 或者及时控制局面
... I correct a wrong or right a situation...

205
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,168
都能让我变成快乐的巡警
...then I'm a happy cop.

206
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:39,341
在这一生中 我们要尽量做些好事
And we move through this life, we should try and do good.

207
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,140
做善事

208
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,145
如果我们能做到这一点
And if we can do that...

209
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:54,523
并且没有伤害到其他人的话
...and not hurt anyone else...

210
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,277
那么
...well, then....

211
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,040
- 嘿? - 谁啊? 事儿怎么那么多!

There's no disturbance.

I got a call of a disturbance. I wanna see what's going on.

218
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,225
这里没有吵闹! 没吵闹你紧张什么呢!
- Yeah, but there's no disturbance. - Then you got nothing to worry about.

219
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:33,979
因为你刚才没说 我清楚自己有什么权利 你不能
You don't tell me. I know my rights. Just come right in. You can't just....

220
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,981
哦 女士你想测试我是么?
All right, ma'am, you wanna test me?

221
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,193
如果你想考我法律那么现在就可以开始
All right? You wanna tell me about the law book, we can do that.

222
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,404

- Okay? Now calm yourself down. - I am calm!

224
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:49,578
你一点都不冷静 因为你正在冲我大喊大叫
No. You are not calm. You're screaming at me.

225
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,497
明白了么?
Do you understand?

226
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,875
我接到一个扰民的举报 现在我要调查一下

所以我要开始调查了
That is what I'm going to do.

228

- Are you alone in here? - I ain't got to answer your questions.

229
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,426
你可以不回答 但是我还是会再问你一遍
No, you don't, but I'm gonna ask you one more time.

230
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,763

234
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,815
我已经说过了 没有!

235
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,068
- 你是不是在说谎? - 我是一个人住的
- Are you lying to me? - I live by myself.

236
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:24,696

JlM: I asked you to sit on the couch. MARClE: This is bullshit.

253
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,463
胡扯 他妈的胡扯
This is bullshit. This is fucking bullshit.

254
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,841
我需要支援
15- L- 27, I'm gonna need backup.

255
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:28,343
你他妈的要干什么? 你个狗东西!
What the fuck is this? lt's bullshit, motherfucker!

256
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,930

257

- 在那儿呆着 马克尔 - 不许进我的卧室!
JlM: Stay right there, Marcie. - Don't you go in my bedroom!

258
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:38,520
你他妈的!混账东西! 别进走廊!
This is bullshit, motherfucker! Don't go down the hallway!

259
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,731
不许往前走了 别他妈的往前走了!
Don't go down my motherfucking hallway!

260
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,024
洛杉矶警察!
JlM: This is the LAPD!

261
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,234
别他妈进我卧室!
Don't go in my goddamn bedroom!

262
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,361
举双手出来!
JlM: Come out now with your hands up!

263
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,282
听见没有?! 那儿什么都没有!
MARClE: What did I tell you? Ain't nobody in there!

264
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,534
你还往哪儿走 狗东西?!
Where the fuck you going, motherfucker?

265
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,786
别他妈进我卧室!
Don't go in my goddamn bedroom!

266
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,873
离我的壁橱远点!你他妈的!
Stay out of my motherfucking closet! What did I tell you?

267
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,375
你他妈听见没!? 我是警察!
- Don't go down my hallway! - This is the police!

268
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:03,045
壁橱里有人吗? 出来
lf there is anyone in this closet, come out...

269
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,881
让我看到你的双手
...and show yourself to me now, with your hands up.

270
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:09,509
玛茜 别再拖椅子了!
Marcie, do not drag that couch any further!

271
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:10,761
别藏着了!
Don't do this, ma'am!

272
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:14,097
我壁橱里什么都他妈的没有!
There's nobody in my motherfucking closet!

273
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,558
我要打开壁橱 我会开枪的!
lf I have to open this closet, you will get shot!

274
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,394
快回来 你他妈的混蛋!
MARClE: Come back here! Come back here, motherfucker!

275
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,897
我他妈的有话和你说!
What can't you goddamn fucking talk to me?

276
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:26,860
那里面什么人都没有! 我告诉你! 马克尔 闭嘴!
- There's nobody in there! I told you! JlM: Marcie, quiet down!

277
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:32,783
你他妈的别乱来了! 净他妈胡来!混蛋!
MARClE: This don't make no fucking sense! This don't make no goddamn sense!

278
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,410
你妈的!狗东西!
This is bullshit, motherfucker!

279
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,245
过来问我!为什么不过来问我!?
Why can't you talk to me?

280
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,832
哇哦 喔
Whoa! Whoa- ho!

281
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,085
这他妈是什么啊?玛茜
What the hell is this, Marcie?

282
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,587
那不是我的
That ain't mine.

283
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,757
我们坐在这儿时他正在慢慢死去
LlNDA: He's dying. He's fucking dying as we're sitting here.

284
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,217
竟然他妈的连个办法都
There's not a fucking...

285
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:52,427
天哪!你怎么能叫我冷静下来!?
Jesus, how can you tell me to calm down?

286
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,931
我能做的就是尽我所能帮助你
I can help you through this, but there's certain things...

287
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:59,267
但你也知道的 你必须接受这个事实 我们可以接受它的
...you're gonna have to take care of, and we can go over them...

288
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,229
不过前提是你必须安静坐下来 听我说
...but I need to know that you're listening to me, okay?

289
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:05,440
我 我快要疯了 他要死了 我却不知该做
I'm- I'm in a fucking state. lt's like he's going, and I don't-

290
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:08,944
好吧 告诉我些实际的 比如处理遗体什么的
Just tell me practical things, like what the fuck do I do with his body?

291
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:12,280
死的时候我该做什么? 下一步怎么办 然后呢?
What do I do when he dies? What next? What happens then? What next?

292
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,157
援助会将做这些
That's what Hospice can take care of.

293
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,201
他们会派一个护士过去
They'll send over a nurse, somebody who-

294
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,245
不 他已经有菲尔在那儿了
No. Phil. He has Phil now.

295
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:20,997
菲尔是派过去的护士么?
- Phil is one of the nurses from the service? - Yeah.

296
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,668
如果你对菲尔满意的话 就让他继续做着
lf you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine...

297
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:27,212
但是最好联系援助会让他们来处理尸体
...but contact Hospice to arrange for the body.

298
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,172
你不懂得的
You don't understand. lt's-

299
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:33,093
现在他一天比一天痛苦 那些狗屁药片一点用都没有
There's more pain than before, and the fucking morphine pills aren't working...

300
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:36,722
这两天 他根本连咽东西都不行
...and it's like- The past two days, he can't really swallow...

301
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:40,350
我根本不知道药能不能咽下去
...and l, um- I don't know if the pills are going down.

302
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:44,187
我根本看不见他嘴里 我一晚上只能看着他
I can't see inside his mouth anymore, and I'm up all night staring at him...

303
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:47,774
我根本不知道药咽下去没有 他在呻吟 他太难受了
...and I don't know if the pills are going down. He moans and he hurts.

304
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,277
我们有办法的 我可以给他
We can fix that, because I can give you-

305
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:52,237
你在听吗?
Are you listening?

306
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:55,699
在听 我感觉好些了 要坐下吗?
- Yeah. I'm listening. I'm getting better. - Do you wanna sit down?

307
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,617
我得坐一会儿
I need to sit down.

308
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,999
厄尔恐怕撑不下去了
Okay, Linda, EarI's not gonna make it.

309
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:07,794
他就快不行 他就要 非常快
He's dying. He is. He's dying very, very rapidly.

310
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:11,548
我们需要做的就是 尽可能地结束
The thing here is to make this experience...

311
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:14,885
这种痛苦和折磨 让他轻松一些离去
...as painless and easy for him as possible.

312
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,678
懂了么?
You understand?

313
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:21,016
救助会能接手这一切过程
Now, Hospice will take care of all the technical things.

314
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:24,186
他们帮助你处理他的遗体
They will help you. They will take care of the body.

315
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,605
只需要在他离去后打个电话
They are who you call when he dies.

316
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:30,025
这是救助会的号码
There's the number of Hospice.

317
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:35,489
还有就是 除了以前开的吗啡药片外
Okay. Now, as far as the morphine pills go...

318
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,657
还有一种药可以考虑一下
...there's something else to consider.

319
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:42,537
有一种效果非常显著的液体吗啡疗法
There's a very strong, very potent solution of liquid morphine...

320
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:45,624
一小瓶吗啡 放在眼药滴瓶里
...and it's a little bottle. lt has an eyedropper.

321
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,418
这样能很方便的滴进他的咽喉部
lt's easy to get into his mouth and drop on his tongue...

322
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:52,172
立刻就能消除他的体内痛苦
...and it will certainly diminish the pain that he's in.

323
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:57,427
但是你必须知道 一旦使用这种药
But you need to realize that, uh, once you give it to him...

324
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,846
他就不可能痊愈了
...there really is no going back.

325
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:04,643
这东西肯定会去除痛苦 但会立刻让他失去知觉
lt will certainly cure his pain, but he will drift in and out of consciousness...

326
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,896
这将比现在还要糟
...even worse than he is now, Linda. I mean...

327
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:13,193
厄尔 将会完全没有知觉 将不是厄尔了
All sign of the recognizable Earl will pretty much go away.

328
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:20,033
我还能说什么呢? 不知道这样行么
l- What the fuck can I say to- ? I don't know what to say to that.

329
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,255
我不想这样
I don't want to do this.

330
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,424
这么坐着
Sit here.

331
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:41,221
看得到东西
I can see the things, you know.

332
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:44,683
我什么都知道 狗日的
lt's getting there, that's the cocksucker.

333
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,895
我看得到那支笔
I see that pen.

334
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:51,231
我看得见它 就是这个
I see it. I know it's there.

335
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,316
我够到它
I reach for it.

336
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,944
不
No.

337
00:19:57,572 --> 00:20:00,282
有什么用?
No. No goddamn use.

338
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,869
知道吗 我有个儿子
I have a son, you know.

339
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,829
- 是吗? - 是
- You do? - Yeah.

340
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:08,415
- 他在哪? - 不知道
- Where is he? - I don't know.

341
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,250
我知道
I mean...

342
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,003
就在这里
...he's around, but...

343
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:18,550
他就在镇上 但我不知道在哪儿
He's here in town, but I don't know.

344
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,886
知道么
You know...

345
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,346
他很倔的
...he's a tough one.

346
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,266
非常倔
Very....

347
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,231
- 菲尔 有女朋友吗你? - 没有
- Got a girlfriend, Phil? - No.

348
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,650
- 赶快找一个 - 我在努力
- Get a girlfriend. - I'm trying.

349
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:39,279
做些漂亮的事儿 和她一起
Do good things with her. Share the things.

350
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:42,240
就像那些狗屁话说的
- All that bullshit is true, you know. - Yeah.

351
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:46,036
找个好的 抓住她不放 然后就成功了
Find a good one, hold on, and all that.

352
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,495
琳达人呢?
Where's Linda?

353
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,582
她有点事儿出去了
She went out. She, uh, said she went out to run some errands.

354
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,792
马上就回来
- She'll be back. - Oh.

355
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,961
她是个好女孩
- She's a good girl. - Yeah.

356
00:20:56,547 --> 00:21:02,510
就是有点傻 不过还算是好女孩
She's a little nuts. Heh. But she's a good girl, I think. Yeah.

357
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,096
她就是有点傻
- She's a little daffy. Yeah. - Yeah.

358
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,182
她爱你
She loves you.

359
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,893
嗯 可能吧
Well, maybe.

360
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,520
- 是 - 对
- Yeah. - Yeah.

361
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,105
她是个挺好的女孩
She is a good one.

362
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,983
你最后一次和儿子说话是什么时候?
When's the last time you talked to your son?

363
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,111
不记得了
I don't know.

364
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:22,656
十
Ten.

365
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:27,702
可能是十 或者五
Maybe ten.... Five...

366
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,539
操
Fuck.

367
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,085
操
Fuck.

368
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,963
又一样东西没掉了
That's another thing that goes.

369
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:42,384
你的记忆? 时间顺序 懂吗?
- Your memory? - Time lines, you know?

370
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:48,390
我能记起事情 但是不知道何时发生的
I can remember things, but not right there.

371
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,183
- 明白吗? - 明白
- You know? - Yeah.

372
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:52,435
明白?明白个屁
Yeah? What the fuck do you know?

373
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:55,730
以前见到过这样的 像我这样的傻逼?
- I've seen it before. - Oh, other fucking assholes like me?

374
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:58,733
- 没有人像你一样 - 狗日的
- Ah, there's no asshole like you. - Cocksucker.

375
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:03,738
为什么每句话都这种词儿 狗日的 混蛋 或者 傻逼?
How come every word you use is either cocksucker, shit balls, or fuck?

376
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:06,992
- 你知道你该做什么吗? - 去死?
- Do me a personal favor. - Go fuck myself.

377
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,576
真他妈聪明
- You got it. - Ha, ha.

378
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,254
我不能
I can't...

379
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:21,214
我再也受不了这些了
I can't hold on to this any longer.

380
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:25,677
再给你来点吗啡好吗? 不 把电话给我
- I'll get another pill. Another morphine pill. - No. Give me the fucking phone.

381

You think she's your friend, Geoff? You think she's your friend?

494
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,422
这些女人根本不能成为朋友
They're not your friends.

495
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:44,800
难道你真的以为她们能与你共度难关 相濡以沫吗?
Do you really think she's gonna be there when things go bad?

You got your neighbors real worried for you.

911
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:45,128

- Did you hear what I just said? - Yes, but I don't know what....

918
00:58:02,563 --> 00:58:05,731
你听音乐时太大声了
Okay. You're listening to your music so loud...

919
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:10,403
- 这样会使你听力受损的 - 好吧
- ...you're gonna damage your ears. - Okay.

920
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:13,573
如果你老是把音量调得这么大
lf you continue to listen to your music at that level...

921
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:18,035
那就不仅仅让你自己听力受损 你邻居们也得受损伤
...you're gonna damage not only your ears, but your neighbors' ears as well.

922
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:21,080
我刚真没觉察有那么大声
- I didn't realize it was that loud. - Yeah.

923
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:24,458
看吧 这是听力受损的先兆

924
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:26,127

你经常这么音响电视一起开么?
You usually keep that on at the same time?

927

不知道 怎么了?
I don't know. I mean, um.... What is this?

音乐声音太大 还有尖叫和吵闹声
Some loud music, A, and some screaming and yelling.

933
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:02,914
是不是之前有尖叫和吵闹呢?

我不愿意看见的人
Someone that I didn't want here.

937
00:59:12,633 --> 00:59:18,888
然后我叫他走 就是这样
And I told them to leave, so it's no big deal.

938
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:22,725
然后就走了 实在抱歉
They left. I'm sorry.

939

941
00:59:32,027 --> 00:59:33,486
那么 他是谁呢?

00:59:33,654 --> 00:59:37,156
我和他 反正已经走了
I was.... He's gone.

943
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:41,077

I mean, it's not- lt's over, you know?

944
00:59:46,667 --> 00:59:49,418
介意我四处检查一下吗?

You have to tone it. Don't be real aggressive like that.

1027
01:04:53,932 --> 01:04:56,684

01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:10,990
你们根本想不到这孩子出门时 穿成什么样子!
Oh, you should have seen what she had on walking out the door.

1033

JlMMY: The book says, We may be through with the past...

1040
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:27,715
但我们不会改变
...but the past ain't through with us.

1041
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:31,468
我们在高处相见 然后在广场上分手
We met upon the level and We met upon the level, and we're parting on the square.

01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:09,306
我父亲 哦 很不幸 他已经去世了
Oh, my father. Unfortunately, he passed away.

1140
01:11:09,474 --> 01:11:11,642
- 非常抱歉 我无意的 - 不 没关系
- Oh, I'm sorry. I had no idea. - No, please.

1141
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:13,936
我不该问这个的
I wouldn't have brought that up if I had known.

1142
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:16,021
- 这对你太残酷了 - 拜托
- That's a very hard thing. - Please.

1143
01:11:16,189 --> 01:11:18,857
没关系的 是的 很残酷 不过 听着
Yes, it is, but listen.

1144
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:21,652
还是应该往前看 过去的终究已经过去了
I mean, you have to move forward. The past has its place.

1145
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:25,530
- 已经很久以前的事了 生老病死 - 是
- lt was a long time ago, and people die. - Yeah.

1146
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:27,699
我们换个话题吧
Okay, let's switch gears here. Um...

1147
01:11:30,036 --> 01:11:33,121
根据你书里写的 你毕业于伯克里大学是么?
According to your book, you ended up at UC Berkeley?

1148
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:34,373
对 84年到89年
'84 to '89.

1149
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:35,916
- 心理专业 - 没错
- Psychology major. - That's right.

1150
01:11:36,084 --> 01:11:37,793
- 没完成硕士? - 嗯?哦
- Get your masters? - Hmm? Oh.

1151
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:39,878
- 差这么一点儿 - 噢
- This close. - Wow.

1152
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:43,674
- 在校园的五年生活非常难忘是吧 - 伙计 来杯咖啡好么?
- That's impressive in five years. - Cap, can I have some coffee?

1153
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:44,925
我能帮到你吗?
Can I get you anything?

1154
01:11:45,093 --> 01:11:47,386
- 不不不 我很好 谢谢 - 你确定?好吧
- No, no, no, I'm good. Thank you. - You sure? Okay.

1155
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:50,097
- 她要很好 我要咖啡 - 哈哈
- She's good. I need coffee. - Ha, ha.

1156
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,893
东西还真不少啊 是吧?
PHARMAClST: Cats and dogs out there, huh?

1157
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:00,983
得好几个人得病了吧?
Must have a lot going on for all that stuff back there, huh?

1158
01:12:02,068 --> 01:12:03,318
你能
You could, uh...

1159
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:06,446
这些药真会让你无所不能啊
Heh. You could have quite a party, all that stuff.

1160
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:12,786
你用波萨克很久了么? 中枢神经刺激剂呢?
You been on Prozac long? Dexedrine?

1161
01:12:12,954 --> 01:12:15,580
- 我不 - 真厉害
- I don't.... - lnteresting drugs.

1162
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:19,126
知道么 中枢神经刺激剂主要是起加速剂作用的
Dexedrine's basically speed in a pill, you know.

1163
01:12:19,293 --> 01:12:23,755
但我觉得大多数医生决不会将这两种配在一起
I guess a lot of the doctors are balancing out the Prozac with the Dexedrine, so....

1164
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:26,925
这种液体吗啡将会把你立刻放倒
That liquid morphine will knock you down, out...

1165
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:29,928
毫无知觉 如果一旦不用不当的话
...around, up and down, someone's not careful.

1166
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,766
怎么能将它们混在一起呢
You can't mix those up, you know.

1167
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:56,204
强得吓死人啊 我说
Strong, strong stuff here, boy. Wow!

1168
01:12:56,748 --> 01:12:58,790
你到底有什么问题 竟然需要这些玩意儿?
What you have wrong, you need all this stuff?

1169
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:01,001
- 畜牲! - 什么?
- Motherfucker. - What?

1170
01:13:01,169 --> 01:13:04,087
- 他妈的畜牲! - 你说什么?
- Motherfucker. You fucking asshole. - What are you talking about?

1171
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:06,757
- 你以为你他妈的是谁啊? - 我只是
- Who the fuck do you think you are? - I'm just trying-

1172
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:11,136
我来这里 你根本就不知道我是谁 要做什么
I come in here. You don't know me. You don't know who I am, what my life is...

1173
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:14,890
你就敢这么恬不知耻地向我问这问那?
...and you have the balls, the indecency to ask me a question about my life?

1174
01:13:15,058 --> 01:13:18,143
- 夫人 别激动好么? - 还有你这个混蛋 不许你叫我夫人!
- Please, lady, calm down. - Fuck you too! Don't you call me lady!

1175
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:20,812
我进来这里 我把处方交给你们
I come in here, I give these things to you...

1176
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:22,939
你们竟然要检查 还打电话
...you check, you make your phone calls...

1177
01:13:23,107 --> 01:13:25,025
还要怀疑 还要问这问那!
...look suspicious, ask questions.

1178
01:13:25,193 --> 01:13:26,401
我受不了了!
I'm sick.

1179
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:30,489
我的一切都要完蛋了 你们竟然还向我问这问那?
I have sickness all around me, and you fucking ask me my life?

1180
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:31,698
到底想怎么样?
What's wrong?

1181
01:13:31,866 --> 01:13:35,452
没在床上见过死人吗?在你家里!?
Have you seen death in your bed? ln your house?

1182
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:39,164
装什么狗屁正经?还想逼我回答你们的狗屁问题
Where's your fucking decency? And then I'm asked fucking questions.

1183
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:42,626
想要干什么?!
What's wrong?

1184
01:13:42,794 --> 01:13:45,378
让我操了你! 你想要这个是吧!
You suck my dick, that's what's wrong.

1185
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:48,256
还有你 也他妈配叫我夫人?
And you. You fucking call me lady?

1186
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:50,509
你这个臭不要脸的!
Shame on you!

1187
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:55,764
你们两个臭不要脸的
Shame on you. Shame on both of you.

1188
01:13:57,016 --> 01:13:59,309
那么他们为什么不同姓呢?
Why don't they have the same last name?

1189
01:13:59,477 --> 01:14:01,144
因为你看 他们姓氏不一样诶
Because they don't have the same last name.

1190
01:14:01,312 --> 01:14:05,690
我知道 但是很难解释清楚 不过
PHlL: I know, and I can't really explain that, but I think-

1191
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:09,277
我感觉他们之间发生过什么事情
I have a feeling there is something, you know, a situation between them...

1192
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:12,114
可能互相不能很好地理解对方
...like they don't know each other much or well, you know?

1193
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,574
之后两人再也没有过联系了
Something like they don't talk much anymore, even.

1194
01:14:14,742 --> 01:14:15,992
嗯嗯
Uh- huh.

1195
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,703
天哪 听起来很怪异是吧?
You know? God, does this sound weird?

1196
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:21,706
我只是一直不明白你为什么会打给我呢
Ha, ha. I just don't understand why you're calling me.

1197
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:25,752
厄尔的家里找不到关于弗兰克的任何信息
Well, there's no number for Frank in any of EarI's stuff...

1198
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,213
他也快不长了
...you know, and he's pretty out of it.

1199
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:31,466
我说了 他已经不行了
I mean, like I said, he's dying.

1200
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:34,719
被癌症 嗯
Dying of cancer. So...

1201
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:37,889
- 什么癌? - 脑和肺
- What kind of cancer? - lt's brain and lung.

1202
01:14:38,057 --> 01:14:40,559
- 我母亲得过乳癌 - 对不起
- My mother had breast cancer. - Oh, I'm sorry.

1203
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:43,395
- 现在好了是么? - 对 现在好了
- ls she all right? - Oh, she's fine now.

1204
01:14:43,563 --> 01:14:45,397
- 太好了 - 不过还是吓死人了当时
- Oh, that's good. - lt was scary, though.

1205
01:14:45,565 --> 01:14:47,524
- 这种病真的是害死人 - 真的是这样
- Oh, it's a hell of a disease. - Oh, it sure is.

1206
01:14:47,692 --> 01:14:49,985
- 对 - 好吧 嗯
- Yeah. - Well, so, uh...

1207
01:14:50,153 --> 01:14:53,280
对了 真抱歉 到底为什么给我打电话来着?
Wait, I'm sorry. So why call me?

1208
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:56,825
我知道这么做很傻 也很荒唐
I know this sounds silly, and I know that I might sound ridiculous...

1209
01:14:56,993 --> 01:14:58,910
装得好像是电影一样
...like this is the scene of the movie...

1210
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:01,955
老人希望能见失散多年孩子的最后一面
...where the guy is trying to get ahold of the long- lost son...

1211
01:15:02,123 --> 01:15:05,458
但是这真的和现在一模一样
...you know, but this is that scene. This is that scene.

1212
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:08,044
我觉得 他们之所以会把这种故事写进电影
And I think they have those scenes in movies...

1213
01:15:08,212 --> 01:15:10,046
就因为它们在现实中是真实发生着的
...because they're true, you know.

1214
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:12,007
它们真的在发生着
Because they really happen.

1215
01:15:12,175 --> 01:15:16,094
你一定要相信我 千真万确的
And you gotta believe me, this is really happening.

1216
01:15:17,138 --> 01:15:20,390
我把我号码给你 你可以去检查
I mean, I can give you my number and you can go check...

1217
01:15:20,558 --> 01:15:22,601
随便怎么检查都行 只要给我回电话就好
...with whoever you gotta check with...

1218
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:26,104
千万请别让我傻傻地等着
...but do not leave me hanging on this.

1219
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:31,276
好吗? 拜托啦 我实在 求你了
All right? Please. I'm just- Please.

1220
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:33,778
觉得
See....

1221
01:15:35,406 --> 01:15:39,034
这真像电影里面的情节不是么? 最后的拯救的那种
See, this is, uh, the scene of the movie where you help me out.

1222
01:15:39,202 --> 01:15:41,077
你挺厉害 你这些问题很漂亮
You're great. These are great questions.

1223
01:15:41,245 --> 01:15:43,663
- 谢谢 很好 - 真的很好
- GWENOVlER: Thank you. Good, good. - This is going great.

1224
01:15:43,831 --> 01:15:45,957
好吧 我认为你是在这一带长大的
See, I thought you grew up here in the Valley.

1225
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:47,959
是啊 我刚才说过 这一带
Yeah. You know, like I said. Around.

1226
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:49,920
你去过拜占庭高中?
You went to Van Nuys High, right?

1227
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:52,255
我不止上过 我当时天天上
I wouldn't say I went. I frequented.

1228
01:15:52,423 --> 01:15:55,175
教得相当烂 我当时绝对不像现在的弗兰克・T・J・麦吉
I was misguided, pathetic. Not the Frank T.J. Mackey...

1229
01:15:55,343 --> 01:15:58,386
不是现在这个你拼命想曝光的弗兰克
...you're so eagerly, uh, wanting to put on national television.

1230
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:01,806
我当时选择了完全不适合我的人生方向
Because I was swimming in what was as opposed to what I wanted.

1231
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:04,476
- 你的姓是怎么来的? - 我的姓?
- Where does that name come from? - What name? My name?

1232
01:16:04,644 --> 01:16:06,770
这不是你的本姓吧?
Yeah. lt's not your given name, right?

1233
01:16:06,938 --> 01:16:10,857
实际上 这是我妈妈的姓 干得漂亮 继续审问我吧
lt's my mother's name, actually. That's good. Good. Done your research.

1234
01:16:11,025 --> 01:16:13,818
- 那名字弗兰克呢? - 是我外祖父的
- And Frank? - Frank is my mother's father.

1235
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:16,863
事实上 是这样 我遇到了些困难
Oh, okay. That's why. See, I had some trouble...

1236
01:16:17,031 --> 01:16:20,492
当我要查你在加州大学洛杉矶分校和伯克里的注册纪录时
...locating your school records at, um, UCLA and, uh, Berkeley.

1237
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:24,663
可能是因为你换名字 因为他们没有你的正式注册纪录
And it's your name change. See, they had no official enrollment for you.

1238
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:26,915
- 不不不他们不会有的 - 不会?
- No, no, no, they wouldn't. - They wouldn't?

1239
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:30,001
不会的 因为我本来就没有正式注册过
No, because I was never officially enrolled there.

1240
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:31,670
- 还不清楚么? - 有点
- Was that unclear? - Kind of.

1241
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:35,006
拜托 我可不希望有误解
Oh. God, I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood.

1242
01:16:35,174 --> 01:16:37,175
我当时不算正规就读
No, uh, my enrollment was totally unofficial.

1243
01:16:37,343 --> 01:16:39,844
当时很可怜 付不起它们的学费
Sadly, I couldn't afford to pay the tuition up there.

1244
01:16:40,012 --> 01:16:43,348
不过有三个非常优秀的教授 热情地让我听他们的课
There were three wonderful professors who let me to sit in their classes.

1245
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:46,643
他们是麦克里迪 霍恩和兰特里
Their names were Macready, Horn, and Langtree, among others.

1246
01:16:46,811 --> 01:16:50,438
需要的话你可以给他们打电话 我成功的并不轻松
You're welcome to call them if you like. See, I didn't get a free ride...

1247
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:54,526
你非常喜欢研究我那些琐碎的过去
...so, what we're looking at here is a true rags- to- riches story.

1248
01:16:54,694 --> 01:16:57,153
这就是现在人们对我的征服学说兴趣如此之大
That's why people respond so strongly to Seduce...

1249
01:16:57,321 --> 01:17:00,156
因为在当今的年代 征服不仅仅局限于
...because at the end of the day, Seduce may not be just...

1250
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:02,575
分开她双腿插进去占有她
...about picking up chicks, sticking your cock in.

1251
01:17:02,743 --> 01:17:06,329
而是一种对你能成为何种角色的暗示
lt's about finding out what you can be in this world...

1252
01:17:06,497 --> 01:17:12,335
告诉自己 驾驭自己 对自己暗示 我会拿到属于我的东西
...defining it, controlling it, and saying, I will take what is mine.

1253
01:17:12,503 --> 01:17:14,879
可能仅仅是迫切地想要一场口交而已
And you happen to get a little blow job out of it...

1254
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:17,799
- 总之 嘿 管他妈是什么呢 - 哈哈 没错
- ...then, hey, what the fuck? Why not? - Ha, ha, okay. There you go.

1255
01:17:18,384 --> 01:17:22,095
第一回合结束 都很棒
End of Round One. Excellent work, ladies and germs.

1256
01:17:22,263 --> 01:17:24,556
现在应该来看看两队的比分了
I think we should take a look at the scores here.

1257
01:17:24,724 --> 01:17:26,349
少年组1 500分 稍稍领先
Kids are up a leg with 1500...

1258
01:17:26,517 --> 01:17:30,061
成年组紧随其后 是1025分
...and the adults are down a little bit with 1025.

1259
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:32,564
我们马上进入第二回合 最后进入叮叮咚!
So we'll be back for Round Two in a ring- ding- do.

1260
01:17:33,983 --> 01:17:37,319
现在是额外奖励的音乐题目
Whoa, hello, hello. Bonus musical question.

1261
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:40,071
参加者将是
And the winner is...

1262
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:44,326
少年组!
...kids.

1263
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:51,041
他们目前领先 并且将有机会拉大距离
Uh, kids are in the lead. They get a chance to pull further ahead...

1264
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:55,920
只要他们能答对这道额外的音乐题
...if they can answer the following secret- bonus musical question.

1265
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:58,631
好 我现在要念某部歌剧中的一句唱词
Now, what I'm going to do is read a line from an opera.

1266
01:17:58,799 --> 01:18:00,300
我要你们重新唱这句词
Give me that line back...

1267
01:18:00,468 --> 01:18:02,927
用歌剧原作语言来念出来
...in the language in which the opera was written...

1268
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:07,640
如果想要多加250 250 250分的话
...and for a bonus 250- Um, 250- Uh, 250...

1269
01:18:07,808 --> 01:18:10,101
你要把它唱出来!
...uh, you can sing it. Heh.

1270
01:18:11,228 --> 01:18:12,771
下面是唱词
Here's the line.

1271
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:17,400
爱情就是一只无人能驯服的倔强的鸟儿
Love is a rebellious bird that nobody can tame...

1272
01:18:17,568 --> 01:18:20,945
若它不理睬你 什么样的呼唤都会是徒劳无功
...and it's all in vain to call it if it chooses to refuse.

1273
01:18:22,323 --> 01:18:23,782
对 斯坦利
Yes, Stanley.

1274
01:18:24,367 --> 01:18:26,576
嗯 这句是从法语翻译过来的
Well, that was in French...

1275
01:18:26,744 --> 01:18:28,870
它是出自歌剧卡门
...and that was from the opera Carmen...

1276
01:18:29,038 --> 01:18:30,955
是这样唱的
...and that goes:

1277
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:53,812
你这儿刚煮了些咖啡啊
- You got some coffee brewing here. CLAUDlA: lt's not-

1278
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:56,564
是的 不是刚煮 放很久了
lt's been on for a bit.

1279
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:59,359
我喜欢喝冰咖啡的 平时
Yeah, I like iced coffee, generally...

1280
01:18:59,527 --> 01:19:03,488
不过像今天这样的 下着雨什么的日子里
...but a day like today, you know, with the rain and whatnot...

1281
01:19:03,656 --> 01:19:05,865
我喜欢热乎乎的来上一杯
... I enjoy a warm cup.

1282
01:19:11,414 --> 01:19:13,206
要来一杯吗?
Do you want a cup?

1283
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:16,793
方便吗?外面正下得稀里糊涂的
ls that all right? Just raining cats and dogs out there.

1284
01:19:16,961 --> 01:19:20,505
我恐怕还真不想立刻就出去 呵呵
I'd just as soon not go back in it. Heh.

1285
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:23,550
我不知道这喝起来会是什么样子
I don't know how fresh it's gonna be.

1286
01:19:23,717 --> 01:19:26,636
肯定没事儿的 克劳迪娅
Oh, I'm sure it's fine, Claudia.

1287
01:19:30,141 --> 01:19:33,393
你要奶油和糖么?
Do you, um, take cream or sugar?

1288
01:19:33,561 --> 01:19:35,520
可以啊 嗯
That would be fine. Um-

1289
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:39,732
好吧 克劳迪娅 我得把话说完 这样我才算完成巡警的职责
So, Claudia, let me just say, so I can get my role as an LAPD officer...

1290
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:41,985
在我们喝咖啡之前说完
...out of the way before we enjoy our coffee.

1291
01:19:42,153 --> 01:19:45,321
我不喜欢喝咖啡时板着脸喝
I don't like to talk shop over coffee.

1292
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:47,198
我不会把你写进纪录
I'm not gonna write you up.

1293
01:19:47,366 --> 01:19:49,826
我也不会向局里报告你这里的
I'm not gonna give you a citation here...

1294
01:19:49,994 --> 01:19:53,663
不过问题是这样 周围的住着其他人
...but the real problem we have here is that you got people around you...

1295
01:19:53,831 --> 01:19:57,667
那些下班回家的 累了一天终于想休息一下的人们
...people who work from home trying to get some work done...

1296
01:19:57,835 --> 01:20:03,506
而你要是老这么大声音听音乐的话 会给他们造成很大不便
...and if you're listening to your music that loud, they're inconvenienced by that.

1297
01:20:03,674 --> 01:20:06,801
如果你工作过的话 应该不难理解这些
lf you had a job, you'd probably understand, but...

1298
01:20:08,888 --> 01:20:13,266
当然 你喜欢听你的音乐 这没什么错
You like listening to your music. That's fine. That's fine. Um....

1299
01:20:13,434 --> 01:20:16,227
只是希望你能注意一下音量
You're just gonna wanna keep an eye on the volume level.

1300
01:20:16,395 --> 01:20:20,398
或许可以记住音量旋钮的刻度
You know, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial.

1301
01:20:20,566 --> 01:20:22,775
如果中午时我要听音乐 我就是这么调的
lf it's the middle of the day, that's what I do.

1302
01:20:22,943 --> 01:20:27,572
我把它旋到二又二分之一处 以后我就记住了这是我听音乐的最佳音量
...I set it at two and a half, and then I know that's a good listening level for me.

1303
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:32,410
你就是喜欢开得太大声了
But, uh, you like listening to your music loud.

1304
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:36,414
挺好的 挺酷的 有些时候是需要一些发泄吧
That's fine. That's cool. lt's good to rock out sometimes.

1305
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:38,208
不过你还是不应该天天这样啊
But you can't do it every day...

1306
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:42,003
否则真的会让你听力受损伤的 真的
...or else you risk damaging your ears. Seriously.

1307
01:20:45,174 --> 01:20:47,425
- 你每次听音乐都拧这么大吗? - 是的
- You listen to it all the time like that? - Yeah.

1308
01:20:47,593 --> 01:20:51,638
你会把周围人们气疯的
You're gonna drive these people crazy.

1309
01:20:51,805 --> 01:20:53,556
好吧 听懂了么?
Anyway, you get the point.

1310
01:20:53,724 --> 01:20:55,517
- 懂了 - 好
- Yes. - Okay.

1311
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:57,018
嗯
Um...

1312
01:20:57,937 --> 01:20:59,395
谢谢
Cheers.

1313
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:13,117
- 嗯 男朋友气你了? - 我没有男朋友
- So this boyfriend bothering you? - I don't have a boyfriend.

1314
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:16,704
- 那个门口的男士 - 他不是我男朋友
- The gentleman who was at the door- - He's not my boyfriend.

1315
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:23,086
通常情况下 家庭内部充满压力时
Okay. A lot of times, in domestic- abuse situations...

1316
01:21:23,254 --> 01:21:26,214
年轻的女孩子都害怕把他说出来
...the young woman is afraid to speak out.

1317
01:21:26,382 --> 01:21:28,758
不过你不用害怕讲给我听
You don't have to be afraid to tell me anything.

1318
01:21:28,926 --> 01:21:32,804
而且作为一名警察 我可以告诉你
And as a police officer, I can tell you...

1319
01:21:32,972 --> 01:21:35,348
这样会更糟
...it goes bad places.

1320
01:21:36,767 --> 01:21:39,727
女孩子们害怕说出来 还有 知道么 这就是187号
Young woman is afraid, next thing you know, I'm here on a 187.

1321
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:43,189
什么187号?
lt's not- What's a 187?

1322
01:21:43,357 --> 01:21:47,235
这样真的不好 就是代表这样类似的情况
lt's not good. And it's where situations like this always lead.

1323
01:21:47,403 --> 01:21:49,487
不是我男朋友 什么都不是
lt's not my boyfriend, and it's not anything.

1324
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:53,449
都结束了 真的 不会再来了
lt's over. Really. lt's not. He won't come back.

1325
01:21:53,617 --> 01:21:56,703
- 我可不想在跑过来 - 不会的!
- I don't wanna have to come back here- - You won't have to.

1326
01:21:58,956 --> 01:22:03,167
我并不是说不想再来
You know, l- I wouldn't mind coming back.

1327
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:06,087
再来 看看你漂亮的脸儿
You know, get a look at your pretty face again.

1328
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:08,172
失陪一下
I'll be right back.

1329
01:22:14,805 --> 01:22:16,472
给你水
Here you go.

1330
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:18,808
我帮你把外套脱掉 好让你舒服点儿
Let's get the jacket off. lt will help you to breathe.

1331
01:22:21,687 --> 01:22:23,938
我做不下去了
I can't fucking do this.

1332
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:29,277
我 我
I've, uh-

1333
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:33,823
我觉得我要吐了 恐怕
I think- I'm gonna throw up, I think.

1334
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:39,370
我二十岁后就没吐过了
I haven't thrown up since I was 20 years old.

1335
01:22:39,872 --> 01:22:41,497
辛西娅
Cynthia.

1336
01:22:41,665 --> 01:22:43,207
你是个男人
You are the man.

1337
01:22:45,294 --> 01:22:47,629
- 怎么啦? - 我要去洗手间
- What's the problem? - I need to go to the bathroom.

1338
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:49,672
哦 斯坦利 现在不行
Jesus Christ, Stanley. You can't go now.

1339
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,841
离开始就剩一分钟了
You have one minute before we're on the air.

1340
01:22:52,009 --> 01:22:54,010
现在可不是去洗手间的时候!
Now is not the time to go to the bathroom.

1341
01:22:54,178 --> 01:22:56,262
- 你犯什么病了 斯坦利? - 嘿
RlCHARD: Why does this always happen? - Hey.

1342
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:58,389
我说 出什么事儿啦?
Excuse me, is there a problem over there?

1343
01:22:58,557 --> 01:22:59,807
干你屁事儿!
Mind your own business.

1344
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:03,227
- 怎么说话的 这孩子! - 管好你自己吧!
- You better watch your mouth. - Why don't you mind your own business?

1345
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:06,272
- 哦不 她没有 - 冷静下来 拜托
- LUlS: Oh, no, she didn't. - CooI down. Cool it, please.

1346
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:09,817
忍到插播广告就能去了 好么?
Now, Stanley, wait for the commercial break, then you can go.

1347
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:12,904
- 再忍一下 - 他们那里找的这些熊孩子
- Just hold it. - LUlS: Where did they get these kids?

1348
01:23:13,072 --> 01:23:14,072
别说孩子们了
Don't taunt the kids.

1349
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:16,741
- 我只是想看能帮点什么而已 - 别挑事了
- I'm trying to be helpful. - CYNTH lA: Don't start trouble, Luis.

1350
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:20,703

Honey, you haven't seen trouble. Wait till next commercial break.

回到现场 进入第二回合!

1384
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:20,198
让我问问今天参赛的成人组选手们
We're talking to our adult contestants here today.

1385
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:23,075
米姆 资料说你来自加州的查茨沃思
Uh, Mim, it says here that you live in California...

1386

Do you know who I am?

1389
01:25:29,082 --> 01:25:31,209
你是我们大家庭里的一员 我猜
You're a friend of the family, I presume.

1390
01:25:31,376 --> 01:25:32,877
什么意思?
What does that mean?

1391
01:25:33,045 --> 01:25:36,214
没什么 玩转生活
Nothing special. Just a spoke in the wheel.

1392
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:40,134
你以为自己说得挺文雅挺有层次
You talk in rhymes and riddles and rub- a- dub...

1393
01:25:40,302 --> 01:25:44,847
其实对我来说什么都不是 知道么 我曾经很聪明
...but that doesn't mean anything to me. See, see- See, I used to be smart.

1394
01:25:45,015 --> 01:25:47,517
我就是神童 丹尼尔・史密斯
I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith.

1395
01:25:49,478 --> 01:25:52,688
我就是电视里那个神童 丹尼尔・史密斯
I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from TV.

1396
01:25:52,856 --> 01:25:54,565
恐怕很早以前真是吧
lt might have been before my time.

1397
01:25:54,733 --> 01:25:56,776
我记得你 六零年那会儿 对吧?
I remember now. ln the sixties, right?

1398
01:25:56,944 --> 01:25:59,695

- I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. - Like you said.

1399
01:25:59,863 --> 01:26:04,242
天才少年 你曾经被闪电劈过吧?
Smart kid. You got struck by lightning at one time, right?

1400
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:05,785
怎么啦?
DONNlE: So what?

1401
01:26:05,953 --> 01:26:08,287
- 我听说过 - 当时疼吗?
- I heard about that. - Did it hurt?

1402
01:26:08,455 --> 01:26:09,831
很疼
DONNlE: Yes.

1403
01:26:09,998 --> 01:26:12,750
但你现在很正常啊 到底怎么搞的
But you're all right now. So, what's the what?

1404
01:26:12,918 --> 01:26:15,169
- 什么? - 没什么
- What? - That's right.

1405
01:26:15,337 --> 01:26:18,631
我曾经那么聪明 现在却是个傻瓜
I used to be smart. Now I'm just stupid.

1406
01:26:18,799 --> 01:26:22,593
布拉德 亲爱的 是谁曾经说过来者
Ha! Brad, dear, who was it that said:

1407
01:26:22,761 --> 01:26:26,597
一个天才决不会因为毁于自己的手中?
A man of genius has seldom been ruined but by himself?

1408
01:26:26,765 --> 01:26:28,266
嗯
Um...

1409
01:26:29,393 --> 01:26:32,228
- 是可爱的塞缪尔・约翰逊 - 啊
The lovely Samuel Johnson. - Ah.

1410
01:26:32,729 --> 01:26:35,690
这个谁又接着说 那么他不仅自己愚笨
Who also spoke of a fellow who was not only dull...

1411
01:26:35,858 --> 01:26:37,608
更会令大家变得愚笨?
...but a cause of dullness in others.

1412
01:26:37,776 --> 01:26:39,318
更会愚笨大家
DONNlE: The cause of dullness in others.

1413
01:26:39,486 --> 01:26:42,280
- 是啊 是啊! - 我来告诉你
- Picky, picky. - Let me tell you this.

1414
01:26:42,447 --> 01:26:45,491
塞缪尔・约翰逊从来没有过这种破日子
Samuel Johnson never had his life shit on...

1415
01:26:45,659 --> 01:26:48,619
让别人把他钱拿走 偷走!
...and taken from him, and his money stolen.

1416
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:51,289
谁抢走了他的人生和金钱?
Who took his life and his money?

1417
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:55,042
他家长? 他妈妈和爸爸?
His parents? His mommy and daddy?

1418
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:57,837
规定他过着这样的生活
Make him live this life like this.

1419
01:26:58,005 --> 01:27:02,133
一个从小过着这种狗屁日子的有天赋的人
A man of genius who gets shit on as a child...

1420
01:27:02,301 --> 01:27:05,303
会留下伤痕的!非常痛苦的!
...and that scars. That hurts.

1421
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:07,305
你到底有没有被闪电击过?
Have you ever been hit by lightning?

1422
01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:10,182
很痛的 并不是每个人都能经历
lt hurts. lt doesn't happen to everyone.

1423
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:11,809
那是一种充电
lt's an electrical charge.

1424
01:27:11,977 --> 01:27:14,312
它穿过宇宙找到了自己的方向
lt finds its way across the universe...

1425
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:19,108
然后落在你身上 落在你头上!
...and it lands in your body and your head.

1426
01:27:19,610 --> 01:27:24,530
然后 之后就这么毁了 被他自己
And as for ruined but by himself...

1427
01:27:24,698 --> 01:27:27,617
要不是他父母强加着这种畸形的人生
...not if his parents took his freaking life...

1428
01:27:27,784 --> 01:27:29,869
还抢走他的钱 还命令你做这个
...and his money, and tell you to do this...

1429
01:27:30,037 --> 01:27:33,080
做那个 如果你不做的话
...and to do that, and if you don't, well....

1430
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:36,000
你父母拿走了你比赛赢的奖金?
Your parents took your money that you won on that game show?

1431
01:27:36,168 --> 01:27:39,253
是的! 拿走了
Yes. They did.

1432
01:27:42,341 --> 01:27:45,176
那是什么意思来着 玩转生活?
What does that mean, a spoke in the wheel?

1433
01:27:45,677 --> 01:27:48,262
生活这么一天天转着 不是么?
Things go round and round, don't they?

1434
01:27:49,056 --> 01:27:51,807
是的 转着 转着
Yes, they do. They do.

1435
01:27:52,351 --> 01:27:54,352
但我要实现我的梦
But I'll make my dreams come true.

1436
01:27:55,228 --> 01:27:57,688
听起来垂头丧气的
Sounds sad as a weeping willow.

1437
01:27:57,856 --> 01:27:59,941
我曾经那么聪明
I used to be smart.

1438
01:28:00,108 --> 01:28:02,443
现在却是个傻瓜
But now I'm just stupid.

1439
01:28:04,154 --> 01:28:06,030
我们该为此干杯么?
Shall we drink to that?

1440
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:08,658
我想再多谈谈你的家庭背景
Um, I wanna talk a little bit more about your background.

1441
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:11,369
你之前也有说过
You made, um, some references earlier...

1442
01:28:11,536 --> 01:28:17,500
经历了一些人生经验 和悲惨的事情
...to, uh, subjective human experiences and terrible things, and, um....

1443
01:28:18,335 --> 01:28:21,003
事实上 我对你的过去有一些困惑
Actually, I'm confused about your past, is the thing.

1444
01:28:21,171 --> 01:28:24,215
- 这个还没问完啊? - 这很无聊的
- ls that still lingering? lt's so boring. - Just to clarify....

1445
01:28:24,383 --> 01:28:27,385
- 只是想把一些地方弄清楚 - 至少 嗯
- Just wanna clear some things up. - Useless. Mm.

1446
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:31,347
打扰了 谢谢 有趣的是
Excuse me. See- Thank you, Muff. lt's a funny thing that-

1447
01:28:31,515 --> 01:28:33,849
《诱惑与征服》很重要的一点就是
This is an important element of Seduce and Destroy.

1448
01:28:34,017 --> 01:28:37,019
总是沉浸于过去绝对会对你的进步造成阻碍
Facing the past is an important way of not making progress.

1449
01:28:37,187 --> 01:28:39,730
我这么告诉我的听众 一次一次又一次
This is something I tell my men over and over and over.

1450
01:28:39,898 --> 01:28:41,983
我这并不是
GWENOVlER: This isn't meant, um...

1451
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:44,944
我尝试开导他们问自己
See, I try to teach my students to ask:

1452
01:28:45,112 --> 01:28:47,405
这么做为了什么?
What is it in aid of?

1453
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:49,240
- 你是在问我吗? - 是
- Are you asking me that? - Yes.

1454
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:53,202
- 嗯 为了试着弄清楚你到底是 - 为了什么?
- Well, in trying to figure out who you are.... - ln aid of what?

1455
01:28:53,370 --> 01:28:56,998
弗兰克 我正在回答啊 是为了搞清你是
Well, Frank, I'm saying that in trying to figure out who you are-

1456
01:28:57,165 --> 01:28:58,624
我还有太多更重要的事情
I have more important things...

1457
01:28:58,792 --> 01:29:01,335
- 需要投入 - 我想这事就很重要
- ...to put myself into. - Well, no, it's all important.

1458
01:29:01,503 --> 01:29:03,254
不妨好好投入想一想
I think this is something important...

1459
01:29:03,422 --> 01:29:05,923
可能需要思考的问题 让自己投入进去
...that you might need to think about putting yourself into.

1460
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:08,092
- 不见得 - 嗯 听着 弗兰克
- Mm. Not really. - Um, look, Frank...

1461
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:10,386
我这么做并不是要攻击你
...it's not like I'm trying to attack you here.

1462
01:29:10,554 --> 01:29:11,637
- 不 - 我只是
- No. - I just-

1463
01:29:11,805 --> 01:29:15,016
你只是想进行你的采访 快 快 快
Okay. Hey, this is how you wanna spend your time, then go, go, go.

1464
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:17,393
不过你马上会发现 这纯粹是浪费时间
But you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is.

1465
01:29:17,561 --> 01:29:21,772
世界上最没有意义的事情 就是回顾过去 第三章
The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me. Chapter Three.

1466
01:29:23,150 --> 01:29:25,693
我们先前谈了你的母亲
We talked earlier about your mother...

1467
01:29:25,861 --> 01:29:28,279
你的父亲和他的去世
...and we talked about your father and his death.

1468
01:29:28,447 --> 01:29:32,450
我不是想冲撞你 只是想问一问
I don't want to be challenging, but I have to ask, um...

1469
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:38,289
只是想确认一些听来的消息
I just wanna clarify something. Something that I understand...

1470
01:29:38,957 --> 01:29:43,294
- 我好像没听到什么问题啊 - 我正在想法子巧妙地问出来
- I'm not sure I hear a question in here. - I'm trying to put this as delicately as I can.

1471
01:29:43,462 --> 01:29:45,254
什么问题?
What's the question?

1472
01:29:46,465 --> 01:29:49,050
- 还记得西姆斯小姐吗? - 我认识太多女人
- Do you remember a Miss Simms? - I know a lot of women.

1473
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:52,720
- 不过我肯定她还认识我 - 从你还是个孩子时
- I'm sure she remembers me, ha, ha. - She does. From when you were a boy.

1474
01:29:52,888 --> 01:29:54,805
- 是吗? - 她就住在塔桑纳
- Yeah? - She lived in Tarzana.

1475
01:29:54,973 --> 01:29:57,558
正是我不幸的地方
That's my old stomping ground.

1476
01:30:00,187 --> 01:30:02,271
要开始进攻了是么?
ls this the attack portion of the interview?

1477
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:07,818
- 这个女孩要冲进来杀我吗? - 不是的 只是想弄清楚一些事
- ls the girl coming in for the kill? - No. This is about getting something right...

1478
01:30:07,986 --> 01:30:10,279
重新澄清你之前的回答的问题
...and clarifying answers to an earlier question.

1479
01:30:10,447 --> 01:30:11,989
什么问题?
What question?

1480
01:30:12,157 --> 01:30:15,159
我听说你母亲已经不在了 弗兰克
I was told that your mother died, Frank.

1481
01:30:23,919 --> 01:30:25,795
你听谁说的
That's what you heard.

1482
01:30:27,798 --> 01:30:29,965
那还记得西姆斯小姐么?
Do you remember Miss Simms?

1483
01:30:34,971 --> 01:30:37,306
- 不 - 我和西姆斯小姐交谈过
- No. - Well, I talked to Miss Simms...

1484
01:30:37,474 --> 01:30:42,853
她是你的邻居还是管理员 就在你母亲1980年去世时
...your neighbor and caretaker after your mother died in 1980...

1485
01:30:43,522 --> 01:30:45,523
据我调查
...and in my research...

1486
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:52,154
你原本是厄尔和莉莉帕特里奇・的唯一儿子
... I have you listed as the only son of Earl and Lily Partridge.

1487
01:30:52,322 --> 01:30:56,534
而我又从芭芭拉・西姆斯那里听说 你的母亲莉莉
And what I learned from Barbara Simms is that your mother, Lily...

1488
01:30:57,327 --> 01:31:00,121
1980年就去世了
...died in 1980.

1489
01:31:00,997 --> 01:31:03,833
所以 我猜想之前的信息
So, see, it's my understanding that information supplied...

1490
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,252
你和你公司提供的个人信息
...by you and your company...

1491
01:31:06,419 --> 01:31:09,296
以及你刚才的回答 都是不真实的
...and the answers to the questions I've asked is incorrect...

1492
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:13,551
我若真想弄清楚你是谁 你为什么要这么做的话
...and if I wanna get to the bottom of who you are and why you are...

1493
01:31:13,718 --> 01:31:19,223
那么我想关于你家庭的一些情况 你真实的家庭背景
...then I think that your family history, your actual family history...

1494
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:25,146
嗯 是非常重要的
Well, this is important.

1495
01:31:26,690 --> 01:31:29,191
你他妈到底想问什么?
What is your fucking question?

1496
01:31:31,903 --> 01:31:34,697
嗯 我想问的就是
Well, I guess my question is this:

1497
01:31:36,616 --> 01:31:39,243
你为什么要撒这些谎呢 弗兰克?
Why would you lie, Frank?

1498
01:31:41,538 --> 01:31:44,415
少年组 成人组
Kids, adults...

1499
01:31:44,583 --> 01:31:48,335
现在是我们轻松的野餐时间
... I would like you to put yourself at a picnic.

1500
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:52,047
你可以叫上你的家人朋友一起享受
Uh, place yourself there with your family and friends, if you'd like.

1501
01:31:52,215 --> 01:31:55,217
你们将听到三个音乐代号 你们得告诉我
You'll hear three musical notes, and you are to tell me...

1502
01:31:55,385 --> 01:31:59,221
它表示你能在野餐中发现什么
...what it might represent that you would find at a picnic.

1503
01:31:59,389 --> 01:32:01,515

I have perfect pitch, you see, and that would be A- D- E...

1506
01:32:13,945 --> 01:32:17,615
- 代表的应该就是柠檬了 - 加 250 分 下一组 请听
- ...and that would represent lemonade. - JlMMY: For 250. Next notes, please.

1507
01:32:23,371 --> 01:32:26,957
- 陶德? - 有了 这是 E- G- G 就是鸡蛋

When I met him- When I started- I met him, I fucked him, and I married him...

1528
01:33:37,028 --> 01:33:39,863
我只是因为钱 明白么?
...because I wanted his money. You understand?

1529

我现在真的太爱他了 他就要死了
I've fallen in love with him now for real, as he's dying, and...

1534
01:33:54,921 --> 01:33:58,215
我看着他 他就要死了 阿伦 他马上就
Uh, I look at him, and he's about to go, Alan. He's moments...

他们肯定笑死了
They must be laughing their asses off.

1653
01:41:04,684 --> 01:41:07,144

我一直想
I was- I was wondering....

1698
01:44:07,992 --> 01:44:10,452
哦!我觉得自己好傻
Man, I feel like a bit of a scumbucket doing this...

1699
01:44:10,620 --> 01:44:12,829
我来这里是执行任务的
...since I came here as an officer of the law...

1700
01:44:12,997 --> 01:44:16,625
但我会恨死自己 如果我不把真话说出来的话
...but I feel like I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really wanna do...

1706
01:44:32,767 --> 01:44:35,226
打从你开门时我就在想了
I've been thinking since you opened the door.

1707
01:44:35,394 --> 01:44:37,354
- 真的? - 是
- Really? - Yeah.

1708
01:44:37,521 --> 01:44:39,397

1715
01:44:56,958 --> 01:44:59,292
弗兰克 我真的不是想要为难你
GWENOVlER: Frank, I'm really not trying to attack you here.

1716
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:04,464
只是觉得是否需要弄清一些事情 关于你的
I think that if you have something that needs to be cleared up, well, then...

1717
01:45:08,928 --> 01:45:11,388
我刚说了你的父亲叫厄尔・帕特里奇
I was told that your father is Earl Partridge.

1718
01:45:11,555 --> 01:45:14,516
我听说他离开了你和你母亲
I was told that he left you and your mother...

1719
01:45:14,684 --> 01:45:18,019
你一直照顾着生病的母亲
...and you were forced to take care of your mother during her illness...

1720
01:45:18,187 --> 01:45:21,731
是你照料了患癌症的她
...that you took care of your mother while she struggled with cancer...

1721
01:45:21,899 --> 01:45:24,234
然后西姆斯小姐成为你的监护人
...and that Miss Simms became your caretaker...

1722
01:45:24,402 --> 01:45:27,445
自从你母亲去世后
...when your mother finally passed away.

1723
01:45:29,532 --> 01:45:32,826
能谈谈你母亲么 弗兰克
Can you talk about your mother, Frank?

1724
01:45:34,829 --> 01:45:37,580
不 不 不是这样 知道么!即使你不愿意帮她口交
No, not true. You know what? Even if you don't get to pump her...

1725
01:45:37,748 --> 01:45:40,125
你也应该尽量表现得非常尊重女性
...you still need to start honing your skills on a feminist.

1726
01:45:41,544 --> 01:45:43,962
- 你必须这样做 - 我会的
- You need to do that. - I will.

- Get him on the phone with me right away. - What happened?

1731
01:45:54,098 --> 01:45:56,766
唐尼 赶快叫弗兰克来接电话
Doc, go get Frank and put him on the phone.

1732
01:45:59,603 --> 01:46:01,563
哦 别这样 弗兰克
GWENOVlER: Oh, come on, Frank.

1733
01:46:01,731 --> 01:46:03,440
你怎么了?
What are you doing?

1734
01:46:06,110 --> 01:46:08,111
我怎么了?
What am I doing?

1735
01:46:08,946 --> 01:46:10,488
是啊
Yeah.

1736
01:46:12,116 --> 01:46:15,493
我在默默地审判你
I'm quietly judging you.

1737
01:46:16,912 --> 01:46:22,292
五 四 三 二
And five, four, three, two....

1738
01:46:24,712 --> 01:46:26,046
哦?
Yeah?

1739
01:46:26,213 --> 01:46:28,339
哦 重新回到现场
Oh, boy, what a day. What a round.

1740
01:46:28,507 --> 01:46:30,175
重新和我一起进入
Back and in for me...

1741
01:46:30,342 --> 01:46:35,180
最后的一对一单元 看看谁会想到最后
...and the final one- on- one round to determine who's who today.

1742
01:46:35,347 --> 01:46:38,141
首先我们来看看两队积分板
Let's check the scores on the board, shall we?

1743
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:41,853
嗯 少年组刚好2000
Well, the kids have an even 2000...

1744
01:46:42,021 --> 01:46:46,149
成年组则超过4700
...and the adults are way up with 47.

1745
01:46:46,317 --> 01:46:51,738
不过 这并不意味着 孩子们不可能反败为胜
Now, that doesn't mean that this game is out of reach for the kids.

1746
01:46:51,906 --> 01:46:55,325
- 队长 你们选出谁参加了么? - 就是我啦 吉米
- Elders, who's the lucky so- and- so? - lt's gonna be me, Jimmy.

1747
01:46:56,994 --> 01:46:58,495
请上台来 米姆
Come on over, Mim.

1748
01:47:00,122 --> 01:47:02,749

I don't wanna go. I can't do it this time.

1749
01:47:02,917 --> 01:47:04,667
你他妈的说什么呢?
What the fuck are you talking about?

1750
01:47:04,835 --> 01:47:08,505
你必须去啊 斯坦利 你是最聪明的
You have to go, Stanley. You're the smartest.

1751
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:10,715
我不要去 你们随便谁上去不行么?
I don't wanna go. Why can't one of you do it?

1752
01:47:10,883 --> 01:47:15,053
你要敢不起来上台去 我就踹死你
RlCHARD: lf you don't fucking stand up and get over there, I'm gonna beat your ass.

1753
01:47:15,221 --> 01:47:18,890
我受够了总做第一 不得不做这做那
I'm sick of being the one who always has to do everything.

1754
01:47:19,058 --> 01:47:23,144
- 我不要老是这样! - 孩子们 我想不用问了吧
- I don't wanna be the one always. - JlMMY: Kids, I don't even have to ask.

1755
01:47:23,312 --> 01:47:25,939
快过来
Stanley, get your butt over here.

1756
01:47:32,655 --> 01:47:34,739
我要疯了
I'm sick.

1757
01:47:34,907 --> 01:47:36,866
我不行了
I'm sick here now.

1758
01:47:37,952 --> 01:47:40,286
我经常这样郁闷得死去活来
I confuse melancholy with depression sometimes.

1759
01:47:40,454 --> 01:47:43,414
- 嗯嗯 - 你瞧
- Mm- hm. - You see?

1760

1762
01:47:50,214 --> 01:47:52,006
我是疯了 我恋爱了
I'm sick, and I'm in love.

1763
01:47:52,174 --> 01:47:55,593
你看上去好像为情所困似的
You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.

1764
01:47:55,761 --> 01:47:57,637
完全正确!
That's right.

1765
01:47:57,805 --> 01:48:00,265
你从来没有这么正确过
That's the first time you've been right.

1766
01:48:00,432 --> 01:48:04,060
我为情所困 但是我不怕!
I confuse the two, and I don't care.

1767
01:48:04,603 --> 01:48:07,897

1770
01:48:12,903 --> 01:48:15,280
咱们明天再见面
I'll talk to you- I'll talk to you tomorrow.

lf you wanna love me back, I'll be good to you.

1774

我会对你好得不能再好的
I'll be goddamn good for you.

1775
01:48:26,667 --> 01:48:29,752
我不会因为你这个不懂那个不懂而生气
I won't be mad if you don't know who said what.

1776
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:32,088
我不会因为你回答错误而惩罚你
I won't punish you if you get the answer wrong.

1777
01:48:32,256 --> 01:48:34,716
- 布拉德 亲爱的 - 我可以教你 告诉你
- Brad, honey. - I can teach and tell you...

1778
01:48:34,884 --> 01:48:37,468
你的心智缺陷很严重
You have a special secret crush over there, I think.

1779
01:48:37,636 --> 01:48:39,929
别这么爱他 他会伤害得很惨的
Don't treat him too lovely. He might get hurt.

1780
01:48:40,097 --> 01:48:42,765
- 给我闭嘴!你别管闲事! - 小心点 小子
- You shut up! Mind your own business. - Gently, son.

1781
01:48:42,933 --> 01:48:44,350
我知道你现在并不爱我
I know you don't love me now.

1782
01:48:44,518 --> 01:48:47,270
错把可爱当恋爱是非常危险的
lt's a dangerous thing to confuse children with angels.

1783
01:48:48,689 --> 01:48:51,774
知道共有的元素是什么吗?
Wanna know the common element for the entire group, like he asked?

1784
01:48:51,942 --> 01:48:54,527
我来告诉你们 我知道
I'll tell you the answer, because I had that one.

1785
01:48:54,695 --> 01:48:56,529
我会回答这个问题
I had that question.

1786

碳 是碳

ln pencil lead, it's in the form of graphite...

1788

...and in the diamond, it's in hard form.

1790
01:49:08,959 --> 01:49:12,462
好吧 我们只是需要元素的名字就好
Well, all we really wanted to know was the common element, Donnie...

1791
01:49:12,630 --> 01:49:15,131

...but thank you for all that unnecessary knowledge. Ha, ha.

谢谢 谢谢
Thank you. Thank you.

1794
01:49:20,846 --> 01:49:23,139

The book says, We may be through with the past...

1795
01:49:23,307 --> 01:49:26,142
但我们不会改变!
...but the past is not through with us.

1796
01:49:26,769 --> 01:49:28,645
还有
And....

1797
01:49:28,812 --> 01:49:34,025
不对 那一点也不危险 误把可爱当恋爱
No, it is not dangerous to confuse children with angels.

1798
01:49:45,746 --> 01:49:48,164

1799
01:49:48,332 --> 01:49:51,084
嗯 终于等到这一天了
Well, that is what I wait for.

1800
01:49:51,252 --> 01:49:54,712
我等着别人回电 等待着祈祷着
I wait for those calls. And I wait and I pray.

1801
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:57,674
突然上帝说
And sometimes Jesus says:

1802
01:49:57,841 --> 01:50:00,134
吉姆 今天要给你个惊喜
Jim, I got a surprise for you today.

And I don't think you're gonna screw it up, okay?

1806
01:50:09,937 --> 01:50:12,438
那么 上帝啊 我现在要回答你
And, God, I'm telling you right now...

1807
01:50:12,606 --> 01:50:15,149
我不会把它搞砸的!您把这个机会赐给我
... I will not screw it up. You gave me an opportunity.

1808
01:50:15,317 --> 01:50:17,527
我会好好对这位姑娘的
I'm gonna treat this young lady right.

1809

我是个快乐的警察
I'm a happy cop.

1810
01:50:20,239 --> 01:50:24,200
这个人违反交规 慢着!
Yeah. lt's called jaywalking. Slow down.

1811
01:50:54,064 --> 01:50:56,524
我想让给别人 吉米
Uh, I'm gonna pass, Jimmy.

1812
01:50:57,359 --> 01:51:00,361

All the security and whatnot. You understand?

1820
01:51:22,426 --> 01:51:24,969

This could be a delicate situation for the family.

1821
01:51:25,137 --> 01:51:28,139

1828
01:51:43,322 --> 01:51:47,658

RlCHARD: We want Stanley to go, Jimmy, and we're not sure why he won't.

1829
01:51:47,826 --> 01:51:51,871
总是我来回答问题 我一点儿都不想做了
I always go. I always answer the questions, and I don't wanna do it anymore.

那我还问你做什么
Well, if I had known, then I wouldn't have asked.

2053
02:10:34,577 --> 02:10:36,411
她
She was...

02:10:37,580 --> 02:10:40,081
漂亮死了

2059
02:11:00,353 --> 02:11:02,062
然后我就骗她
And I cheated on her...

2060
02:11:02,230 --> 02:11:07,526
一次次骗她
...over and over and over again...

2061
02:11:08,194 --> 02:11:11,571
因为我觉得这才是男人
...because I wanted to be a man...

2062
02:11:11,739 --> 02:11:14,491
我不想让她长大
...and I didn't want her to be a woman.

2063
02:11:14,659 --> 02:11:19,287
成为一个聪明 自由的人
You know, a smart, free person...

2064
02:11:19,789 --> 02:11:22,123
一个有主见的人
...who was something.

2065
02:11:22,708 --> 02:11:25,252
我很不喜欢那样
My fucking mind then.

2066
02:11:27,588 --> 02:11:31,508
太傻了我当时太傻了
So stupid, that fucking mind. Stupid.

2067
02:11:31,676 --> 02:11:34,135
上帝啊!
Jesus Christ.

2068
02:11:36,055 --> 02:11:40,809
我怎么会那样?当时怎么会那样想呢?
What would I think? Did I think for what I'd done?

2069
02:11:41,811 --> 02:11:45,146
她是我23年的妻子
She was my wife for 23 years

2070
02:11:45,314 --> 02:11:50,485
我却一次次地背叛她
...and I went behind her over and over.

2071
02:11:50,653 --> 02:11:54,948
我这个傻逼 天天跑出去 干别的女人
Fucking asshole that I am, I'd go out and I'd fuck...

2072
02:11:55,116 --> 02:11:58,868
然后回家 然后躺到她身边
...and I'd come home and get in her bed...

2073
02:11:59,036 --> 02:12:02,664
然后对她说 我爱你
...and say, I love you.

2074
02:12:03,791 --> 02:12:06,334
她是杰克的妈妈
This is Jack's mother.

2075
02:12:07,295 --> 02:12:09,379
他的母亲 莉莉
His mother, Lily.

2076
02:12:09,964 --> 02:12:11,840
他们两个
These two...

02:12:13,676 --> 02:12:15,552
是我的
...that I had...

2078
02:12:17,805 --> 02:12:19,764

...and I lost.

2079
02:12:22,143 --> 02:12:26,896

2083
02:12:40,661 --> 02:12:42,912
这些事儿 这些事儿
Something, something.

2084
02:12:45,791 --> 02:12:48,376
- 给我根烟 - 好
- Give me a cigarette. - Okay.

2085
02:13:01,724 --> 02:13:02,932
嗯
Uh....

2086
02:13:15,905 --> 02:13:18,323
像这样的错
Mistakes like this...

2087
02:13:19,283 --> 02:13:21,242
千万别犯
...you don't make.

2088
02:13:22,745 --> 02:13:24,579
可能以后
Sometimes...

2089
02:13:26,165 --> 02:13:29,793
你会做得挺对
...you make some, and okay.

2090
02:13:30,836 --> 02:13:35,256
有时候会做得不对 有时候
Not okay, sometimes, you make other ones.

2091
02:13:35,424 --> 02:13:37,425
是

2092
02:13:37,593 --> 02:13:40,345
然后记住应该更努力些
Know that you should do better.

2093
02:13:43,349 --> 02:13:45,892
我爱莉莉
I loved Lily.

2094
02:13:48,938 --> 02:13:51,022
我骗了她
I cheated on her.

2095
02:13:52,858 --> 02:13:56,069
她和我结婚23年
She was my wife for 23 years.

2096
02:13:59,740 --> 02:14:01,991
然后我有了个儿子
And I have a son.

2097
02:14:02,159 --> 02:14:04,619
然后她得了癌症
And she has cancer.

2098
02:14:05,454 --> 02:14:07,414
然后我离开了他们
And I'm not there...

2099
02:14:07,581 --> 02:14:12,252
然后他不得不自己照顾母亲
...and he's forced to take care of her.

2100
02:14:12,420 --> 02:14:15,088
他才14岁
He's 14 years old.

2101
02:14:15,256 --> 02:14:16,798
就得
To....

2102
02:14:19,385 --> 02:14:22,429
就得照顾自己的母亲 然后
To take care of his mother and....

2103
02:14:22,972 --> 02:14:26,474
然后看着她在自己面前死去
And watch her die on him.

2104
02:14:27,893 --> 02:14:33,148
这么小的孩子 而我却跑了
A little kid, and I'm not there.

2105
02:14:36,652 --> 02:14:38,820
然后她就死了
And she does die.

2106
02:14:45,161 --> 02:14:47,787
我那么爱她
I loved her so.

2107
02:14:48,831 --> 02:14:50,957
但她知道我都做了什么
And she knew what I did.

2108
02:14:51,125 --> 02:14:55,962
她知道我做得一切傻事
She knew all the fucking stupid things I'd done.

2109
02:14:57,590 --> 02:14:59,507
但是爱
But the love...

2110
02:15:00,426 --> 02:15:03,845
要比你能想象到的有力得多
...was stronger than anything you can think of.

2111
02:15:04,889 --> 02:15:07,849
我的忏悔!

2112
02:15:09,059 --> 02:15:11,853

2113
02:15:18,027 --> 02:15:20,028
现在我也要死了
And I'll die.

2114
02:15:20,196 --> 02:15:25,617
我要死了 我告诉你
Now I'll die, and I'll tell you what.

2115
02:15:25,785 --> 02:15:29,037
我一生最大的悔恨
The biggest regret of my life...

2116
02:15:32,708 --> 02:15:35,168
就是抛弃了我的真爱
I let my love go.

2117
02:15:36,545 --> 02:15:38,797
我做了什么?
What did I do?

2118
02:15:41,091 --> 02:15:43,718
我活了65岁
I'm 65 years old.

2119
02:15:44,428 --> 02:15:46,721
我羞愧万分
And I'm ashamed.

2120
02:15:48,265 --> 02:15:50,850
千万年前
Million years ago...

2121
02:15:52,812 --> 02:15:59,192
什么忏悔 什么罪恶
The fucking regret and guilt, these things...

2122
02:15:59,360 --> 02:16:02,570
统统都不存在
Don't ever let anyone ever say to you...

2123
02:16:02,738 --> 02:16:05,615
根本没有什么忏悔
...you shouldn't regret anything.

2124
02:16:06,325 --> 02:16:10,036
别这么做
Don't do that. Don't. Oh.

2125
02:16:10,204 --> 02:16:13,623
为自己所思所想而忏悔
You regret what you fucking want. Ah.

2126
02:16:13,791 --> 02:16:15,291
就这样 就这么做
Use that. Use that.

2127
02:16:15,459 --> 02:16:19,462
做什么事都应该忏悔 任何事
Use that regret for anything, any way you want.

2128
02:16:19,630 --> 02:16:21,464
你可以的 好吗?
You can use it, okay?

2129
02:16:24,176 --> 02:16:25,593
哦 上帝
Oh, God.

2130
02:16:28,556 --> 02:16:31,766
这一路上走得平平坦坦
This is a long way to go with no punch.

2131
02:16:34,270 --> 02:16:37,146
一个挺启发的
A little moral...

2132
02:16:37,940 --> 02:16:40,733
小故事 我说
...story, I say. Ha, ha.

2133
02:16:42,361 --> 02:16:48,908

2158
02:23:33,563 --> 02:23:35,690
刚一直在等你接电话 后来吊线了
We, uh, tried to get in touch. We got disconnected.

2159
02:23:35,857 --> 02:23:38,776
边上去 迈克斯 嘿 快! 快点!
Stay in, Max. Stay in. Hey, hey, come on.

2160
02:23:38,944 --> 02:23:41,028

02:23:41,196 --> 02:23:43,531
- 我收到消息了 - 一直找不到你
I got the message. - Yeah, I couldn't find you.

2162
02:23:43,699 --> 02:23:46,951
厄尔请求我 我就去找地址簿了 里面没有你电话 什么都没有
I looked through the address books. There's no number. There's nothing.

2165

嘿 真不好意思
Hey, I'm sorry, uh....

2166
02:23:57,879 --> 02:24:00,047
我不知道该做什么
You know, I don't know what to do here.

2167
02:24:00,215 --> 02:24:03,551
你爸爸叫我找到你 我连号码都没有
Um, your dad asked me to get in touch with you, and I didn't have the number.

2168
02:24:03,719 --> 02:24:06,721
就拨了那个号码 要进来吗?
You know, I called the number. Do you wanna come in?

都过来
PHlL: Here we go.

2175
02:24:23,196 --> 02:24:24,572

02:25:31,556 --> 02:25:33,140
夫人
Lady.

2185
02:25:33,767 --> 02:25:35,768
你怎么啦?
What's wrong with you?

2186
02:26:24,192 --> 02:26:26,360
我们现在怎么办?
How do we do this, then?

2187
02:26:28,238 --> 02:26:30,364
就这么办吧
Well, we just do it.

2188
02:26:30,949 --> 02:26:34,076
继续下去 慢慢会好的
We do it. We figure it out.

2189
02:26:34,244 --> 02:26:37,079
就这么办吧
We do as we do, I guess.

2190
02:26:38,707 --> 02:26:40,666
你爱我么 露丝?
Do you love me, Rose?

2191
02:26:41,460 --> 02:26:44,336
你是我的男人
You are my handsome man.

2192
02:26:45,881 --> 02:26:50,509
我是个坏男人
- I'm a bad person. - Ha, ha, no. No.

2193
02:26:50,677 --> 02:26:52,470
我是说
I mean...

2194
02:26:52,637 --> 02:26:55,222
我得跟你说出来
... I'm telling you this now, you see....

2195
02:26:55,765 --> 02:26:58,893
因为我想一切都明明白白
You see, because I want everything to be clear and clean...

2196
02:26:59,060 --> 02:27:02,855
而且我要为我以前的所作所为道歉
...and I want to apologize for me and all the stupid things that I've done.

2197
02:27:05,984 --> 02:27:08,068
我骗过你
I've cheated on you.

2198
02:27:10,280 --> 02:27:14,658
我做过对不起你的事 我 非常难受
I've cheated on you, and it kills me...

2199
02:27:14,826 --> 02:27:17,369
一直悔恨不已
...and the guilt of what I've done....

2200
02:27:18,038 --> 02:27:20,414
我不想让你觉得
I don't want you to think-

2201
02:27:22,584 --> 02:27:24,418
你可能知道
Maybe you knew.

2202
02:27:25,462 --> 02:27:28,255
我想你早就知道了吧
I think maybe you've known.

2203
02:27:28,423 --> 02:27:31,967
那么我想说出来 不仅令我
So I hope this is not just for me....

2204
02:27:32,135 --> 02:27:36,430
能好过一些
For me to make myself feel better about what I've done...

2205
02:27:36,598 --> 02:27:41,143
而且我也不想令你觉得 自己和傻子一样
...but for you not to feel like you're sitting there like a jerk.

2206
02:27:41,311 --> 02:27:43,229
你是无辜的
You're the good one.

2207
02:27:43,772 --> 02:27:45,439
知道么?
You understand?

2208
02:27:46,441 --> 02:27:50,694
你以前有和别人在一起 不停地撒谎过吗
Did you ever go out with someone and just lie...

2209
02:27:50,862 --> 02:27:53,489
一句连一句的说谎?
...question after question?

2210
02:27:53,657 --> 02:27:55,950
或许是为了让你看起来很酷
Maybe you're trying to make yourself look cool...

2211
02:27:56,117 --> 02:27:58,494
或者很厉害什么的
...or better than you are or whatever...

2212
02:27:58,662 --> 02:28:01,121
更聪明 更酷
...smarter, cooler...

2213
02:28:01,289 --> 02:28:03,207
你就
...and you just...

2214
02:28:04,918 --> 02:28:06,126
不一定是说谎
...not really lie...

2215
02:28:06,294 --> 02:28:08,921
或许你只是隐瞒些事情
...but maybe you just don't say everything.

2216
02:28:09,089 --> 02:28:11,090
这很平常啊
JlM: Well, that's a natural thing.

2217
02:28:11,258 --> 02:28:15,719
你知道 两个人出去 出去约会什么的
You know, two people go out on a date or something...

2218
02:28:15,887 --> 02:28:17,471
他们想要让别人印象深刻
...they wanna impress people.

2219
02:28:17,639 --> 02:28:19,348
让对方
The other person.

2220
02:28:19,516 --> 02:28:21,600
或者他们害怕如果毫无保留的话
Or they're scared they might say something...

2221
02:28:21,768 --> 02:28:25,271
对方会因此变得不喜欢他
...that will make the other person not like them.

2222
02:28:26,606 --> 02:28:28,649
- 谢谢 - 谢谢
- Thank you. - JlM: Thank you.

2223
02:28:29,776 --> 02:28:31,235
你以前也这样过么?
So you've done it?

2224
02:28:33,488 --> 02:28:35,155
我很少约会的
I don't go out very often.

2225
02:28:35,323 --> 02:28:36,907
为什么不?
Why not?

2226
02:28:39,035 --> 02:28:43,664
找不到我想约会的女孩子
I never found someone, really, that I think I'd like to go out with.

2227
02:28:43,832 --> 02:28:46,792
我打赌你对所有女生都这么说
And I bet you say that to all the girls, huh?

2228
02:28:46,960 --> 02:28:50,462
不不不
No. No. Heh.

2229
02:28:50,630 --> 02:28:54,842
能答应我一件事么?
- Wanna make a deal with me? - Okay.

2230
02:28:55,010 --> 02:28:56,468
我刚说了
What I just said...

2231
02:28:57,470 --> 02:29:00,014
大家都不敢毫无保留
...people afraid to say things...

2232
02:29:00,181 --> 02:29:04,351
都不敢把一切事情诚实地说出来
...no guts to say the things that are real or something....

2233
02:29:04,519 --> 02:29:07,313
- 哦? - 别像这样
- Yeah? - To not do that.

2234
02:29:07,480 --> 02:29:12,359
不要再像从前那样了
To not do that that maybe we've done before.

2235
02:29:15,614 --> 02:29:18,532
让我们一起承诺:
- Let's make a deal. - Okay.

2236
02:29:18,700 --> 02:29:23,829
我把我的一切事情告诉你 你也把一切说给我听
I'll tell you everything, and you tell me everything...

2237
02:29:23,997 --> 02:29:28,542
然后或许我们就能摆脱那些 杂碎啊狗屎什么的 阴影啊心结啊什么的
...and maybe we can get through all the piss and shit and lies that kill other people.

2238
02:29:31,755 --> 02:29:33,047
哇
Wow.

2239
02:29:34,215 --> 02:29:35,633
杂碎 狗屎
Huh. Piss and shit.

2240
02:29:37,761 --> 02:29:39,219
什么?
What?

2241
02:29:40,221 --> 02:29:42,222
用词很强烈啊
You really use strong language.

2242
02:29:42,390 --> 02:29:43,474
不好意思
I'm sorry.

2243
02:29:44,559 --> 02:29:47,186
没事啊
No, it's fine. lt's fine.

2244
02:29:47,354 --> 02:29:50,022
我不是要 听起来很粗俗是吧 我知道的
I didn't mean- lt seems vulgar or something, I know.

2245
02:29:50,190 --> 02:29:51,398
- 没关系的 - 不好意思
- lt's fine. - No, I'm sorry.

2246
02:29:51,566 --> 02:29:54,276
真没事儿的 对不起
No, it's nothing. I'm sorry.

2247
02:29:55,403 --> 02:29:58,530
我要去一下洗手间 马上回来
I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute, maybe, just....

2248
02:29:58,698 --> 02:30:00,324
- 好的 - 好
- Okay. - Okay.

2249
02:31:33,793 --> 02:31:36,670
- 好好 - 可以?
- Okay. Okay. - Okay?

2250
02:31:36,838 --> 02:31:40,090
我现在要进去了 那些狗也在里面么?
I'm gonna go in. And, uh.... Are the dogs in there?

2251
02:31:40,258 --> 02:31:42,134
是的 不过都乖乖地坐在窗户边
Yeah, but they stay back by the window.

2252
02:31:42,302 --> 02:31:44,553
- 我要你跟我一起进去 然后站在一旁 - 好
- All right, I want you to come in with me. - Okay.

2253
02:31:44,721 --> 02:31:46,430
要你进去是预防他有什么情况
And I want you to stay away from me.

2254
02:31:46,598 --> 02:31:50,726
因为我是不会帮他的
I want you there in case he needs anything, because I am not gonna help him.

2255
02:31:51,311 --> 02:31:54,855
还有 菲尔 别让那些狗靠近我
And, Phil, I will drop- kick the fucking dogs...

2256
02:31:55,023 --> 02:31:58,484
- 我会踢它们的 - 好
- ...if they come near me. - Okay.

2257
02:32:18,630 --> 02:32:20,214
厄尔
Earl.

2258
02:32:24,219 --> 02:32:26,386
你看起来不算太惨啊
You don't look that bad.

2259
02:32:42,529 --> 02:32:44,404
狗东西
You prick.

2260
02:32:50,036 --> 02:32:52,663
狗日的 你以前最喜欢用这词儿了 对吧?
Cocksucker. That's what you used to like to say, right?

2261
02:32:52,831 --> 02:32:54,623
狗日的
Cocksucker.

2262
02:32:56,084 --> 02:32:59,753
你自己就是个狗日的 厄尔
But you are. You're a cocksucker, Earl.

2263
02:32:59,921 --> 02:33:02,881
很疼吧 是不是?
lt hurts, doesn't it? Huh?

2264
02:33:04,843 --> 02:33:06,802
你现在很痛苦了?
You in a lot of pain?

2265
02:33:08,930 --> 02:33:11,181
她当时也很痛苦
She was in a lot of pain.

2266
02:33:13,643 --> 02:33:16,478
就在最后时刻 她受尽折磨
Right to the end, she was in a lot of pain.

2267
02:33:19,774 --> 02:33:21,817
我清楚 因为我在她身旁
I know because I was there, Earl.

2268
02:33:21,985 --> 02:33:24,736
你不喜欢 你害怕 对么?
You didn't like illness, though, do you?

2269
02:33:34,038 --> 02:33:35,831
我在旁边
I was there.

2270
02:33:40,753 --> 02:33:44,298
她等着你的电话
She waited for your call.

2271
02:33:47,927 --> 02:33:49,970
等着你来
For you to come.

2272
02:33:57,645 --> 02:34:00,647
我不会哭的
I am not gonna cry.

2273
02:34:02,233 --> 02:34:05,360
我不会为你哭的!
I am not gonna cry for you.

2274
02:34:10,867 --> 02:34:13,869
你这个狗日的 我知道你听得见
You cocksucker, I know you can hear me.

2275
02:34:14,037 --> 02:34:17,831
我要让你听见 我恨死你这混蛋了
I want you to know that I hate your fucking guts.

2276
02:34:18,750 --> 02:34:22,711
快死吧 混蛋
You can just fucking die, you fuck.

2277
02:34:22,879 --> 02:34:26,465
疼死你 折磨死你吧
And I hope it hurts. I fucking hope it hurts.

2278
02:35:10,551 --> 02:35:14,096
她心跳只有六下了 快把担架拿过来
Yeah, her resps are down to six. Let's get the gurney over here.

2279
02:35:15,223 --> 02:35:18,350
检查自我 摘下来 我是先知
DlXON Check that ego Come off it, I'm a prophet

2280
02:35:18,518 --> 02:35:21,144
这位教授 我要去教你的蠕虫
The professor I'm gonna teach you 'bout the worm

2281
02:35:21,312 --> 02:35:25,816
最终转向追赶沉船 随着长时间的压迫颈部
Who eventually turned to catch wreck With the neck of a long- time oppressor

2282
02:35:25,984 --> 02:35:29,236
他正在从魔鬼那里奔逃 但债务总是增加
And he's running from the devil But the debt is always gaining

2283
02:35:29,404 --> 02:35:32,781
而如果他的身价被伤害 他的价值带来的疼痛
And if he's worth being hurt He's worth bringing pain in

2284
02:35:53,594 --> 02:35:56,221
说出来感觉很好了么你?
Do you feel better now that you've said this?

2285
02:35:57,932 --> 02:35:59,850
我不知道
JlMMY: I don't know.

2286
02:36:01,185 --> 02:36:04,855
其实 我没有生气
Well, I'm not mad.

2287
02:36:08,568 --> 02:36:11,486
好吧 有一点 但不算 生气
Well, I am, but I'm not.

2288
02:36:11,654 --> 02:36:13,196

我太爱你了 露丝

2290
02:36:18,703 --> 02:36:21,788
我问题还没问完呢
I'm not through asking my questions.

2291
02:36:26,377 --> 02:36:28,754
为什么克劳迪娅
Why doesn't Claudia...

2292
02:36:29,505 --> 02:36:31,548
不理你 吉姆?
...talk to you, Jimmy?

2293
02:36:33,384 --> 02:36:34,968
为什么?
Why?

2294
02:36:35,762 --> 02:36:37,637
因为我们
Because we've....

2295
02:36:38,931 --> 02:36:41,099
我们都不知道啊 怎么了?
We both don't know. What do you mean?

2296
02:36:41,267 --> 02:36:43,435
不 我想你知道的
No, I think you know.

2297
02:36:43,603 --> 02:36:45,020
我
Maybe....

2298
02:36:46,814 --> 02:36:48,440
不知道
I don't.

2299
02:36:49,650 --> 02:36:52,069
说出来 吉米
Say it, Jimmy.

2300
02:37:00,995 --> 02:37:03,914
- 我想这样 - 这样
- I wanted to do that. - JlM: Well...

2301

- That felt good, to do what I wanted to do. - Yeah.

2302
02:37:09,295 --> 02:37:11,004
跟你说件事行么?
Can I tell you something?

2303
02:37:11,881 --> 02:37:13,131
行啊 当然行
Yeah, of course.

2304
02:37:13,925 --> 02:37:16,718
我好担心你听完会讨厌我
I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon.

2305
02:37:16,886 --> 02:37:19,846
你什么都知道的话肯定会讨厌我的
You're gonna find stuff out about me, and you're gonna hate me.

2306
02:37:20,014 --> 02:37:22,182
不啊 为什么? 你要说什么事?
No. Like what? What do you mean?

2307
02:37:22,350 --> 02:37:26,228
你是这么 这么优秀
You have so much, so many good things...

2308
02:37:26,395 --> 02:37:28,355
你这么冷静
...and you seem so together.

2309
02:37:28,523 --> 02:37:29,940
你是个警官
You're a police officer...

2310
02:37:30,108 --> 02:37:34,027
为人正直 什么问题都能解决
...and you seem so straight and put together, without any problems.

2311
02:37:34,195 --> 02:37:36,738
- 我今天把枪丢了 - 什么?
- I lost my gun today. - What?

2312
02:37:36,906 --> 02:37:38,240
我今天把枪丢了
I lost my gun today...

2313
02:37:38,407 --> 02:37:41,326
然后无数人在讥笑我
...and I'm the laughingstock of a lot of people.

2314
02:37:41,744 --> 02:37:44,371
我想和你说 想让你知道
I wanted to tell you. I wanted you to know.

2315
02:37:44,539 --> 02:37:46,331
一直在想
And it's on my mind.

2316
02:37:46,499 --> 02:37:48,583
我真是太笨了
And it makes me look like a fool.

2317
02:37:48,751 --> 02:37:50,919
我觉得自己太笨了
And I feel like a fool.

2318
02:37:54,715 --> 02:37:56,633
你刚说我们要讲出来
And you asked that we should say things...

2319
02:37:56,801 --> 02:37:59,344
把一切都讲出来 毫不隐瞒
...say what we're thinking and not lie about things.

2320
02:37:59,512 --> 02:38:02,973
所以我要对你讲 我今天把枪丢了
Well, I can tell you that. This. That I lost my gun today.

2321
02:38:03,141 --> 02:38:04,933
我不是个好警察
I'm not a good cop.

2322
02:38:05,101 --> 02:38:07,394
我左思右想 我知道
I'm looked down at, and I know that...

2323
02:38:07,562 --> 02:38:11,314
我害怕你听完就 就不喜欢我了
...and I'm scared that once you find that out, you might not like me.

2324
02:38:14,861 --> 02:38:19,614
- 吉姆 这非常好 - 对不起
- Jim, that was so great. - I'm sorry.

2325
02:38:19,782 --> 02:38:22,075
非常棒 你刚才说的
What you just said.

2326
02:38:25,288 --> 02:38:28,081
我结婚后就没有约会过了
I haven't been on a date since I was married, and...

2327
02:38:28,958 --> 02:38:31,585
那是三年前的事儿了
...that was three years ago.

2328
02:38:31,752 --> 02:38:33,753
无论你想对我说什么
Claudia, whatever you wanna tell me...

2329
02:38:33,921 --> 02:38:36,756
无论你觉得多么糟糕
...whatever you think might scare me won't.

2330
02:38:36,924 --> 02:38:38,758
我都会静静地听的
And I will listen to you.

2331
02:38:38,926 --> 02:38:42,429
我会默默地听 如果你想的话
I'll be a good listener to you if that's what you want. You know?

2332
02:38:42,597 --> 02:38:44,097
我不会妄加评论的
You know? And I won't judge you.

2333
02:38:44,265 --> 02:38:46,850
我有时喜欢这么做 但今天不会的
I know I can do that sometimes, and I won't.

2334
02:38:47,018 --> 02:38:50,604
只是听着你
And I can listen.

2335
02:38:50,771 --> 02:38:53,773
千万别害怕会吓到我
And you shouldn't be scared of scaring me off...

2336
02:38:53,941 --> 02:38:59,321
或者害怕我会怎么想 什么的 总之
...or whatever you think that I think and on and on.

2337
02:38:59,488 --> 02:39:01,364
说出来吧 不管是什么 我听着你
Say it, whatever it is, and I'll listen.

2338
02:39:01,532 --> 02:39:03,950
- 你不知道我这有多傻! - 没关系
- You don't know how fucking stupid I am. - lt's okay.

2339
02:39:04,118 --> 02:39:06,286
- 你想不到我有多变态! - 没事儿的
- You don't know how crazy I am. - lt's okay.

2340
02:39:06,454 --> 02:39:08,872
- 我有麻烦 - 我会去面对的
- I got troubles. - I'll take everything at face value.

2341
02:39:09,040 --> 02:39:12,167
- 尽管说出来给我听啊 - 我提议做这个的 是吧!?靠!
- I'll be a good listener. - I started this, didn't l? Didn't l? Fuck.

2342
02:39:12,335 --> 02:39:15,253
不管是什么 告诉我吧 你可以的
Whatever it is, just say it. You'll see.

2343
02:39:15,421 --> 02:39:16,838
要吻我么?
You wanna kiss me, Jim?

2344

说吧 吉姆
Say it, Jimmy.

2346
02:39:26,807 --> 02:39:28,892
我想她觉得
I think she thinks...

2347
02:39:29,060 --> 02:39:31,603
她以为我骚扰了她
...that I may have molested her.

2348
02:39:33,856 --> 02:39:36,983
她脑袋里老是有这些糟糕的念头
She thinks terrible things that somehow got into her head...

2349
02:39:37,151 --> 02:39:39,277
觉得我真的
...that I may have done.

2350
02:39:39,445 --> 02:39:43,823
她最后那次告诉我说 那是
She said that to me last time, when it was...

2351

十年前了 她走出门 你不该摸我这里 我知道的
Ten years ago, she walked out the door. You touched me wrong. I know that.

2352
02:39:51,165 --> 02:39:57,254
诸如此类的疯话
Some crazy thought in her- ln her head.

2353
02:39:58,464 --> 02:40:00,674
你真的这么摸过她么?
Did you ever touch her?

2354
02:40:06,681 --> 02:40:07,764
不知道
I don't know.

2355
02:40:12,937 --> 02:40:16,356
- 吉姆 - 不知道 我真的不知道
- Jimmy. - I don't know. I really don't.

2356
02:40:18,609 --> 02:40:21,194
但你竟然能说出这些!
But you can't say.

2357

- 我不知道那时做了什么 - 做了 你做了!
- Well, I don't know what I've done. - Yes, you do. You do.

什么?拜托 别这样
What? What? Please. Please.

2360
02:40:39,714 --> 02:40:43,174
活该你该一个人去死!
You deserve to die alone for what you've done.

2361
02:40:43,342 --> 02:40:45,135
我真不知道做什么啊
I don't know what I've done.

2362
02:40:45,303 --> 02:40:47,095
你知道的!
Yes, you do.

2363
02:40:47,263 --> 02:40:50,307
露丝 我说知道的话 你能别走吗?
Rose, if I said that I knew, would you stay?

2364
02:40:50,474 --> 02:40:53,852
- 不 - 但我真的不知道做什么啊!

- What is it? Please, please. - Please. lt's okay. Just let me go.

2371
02:41:41,317 --> 02:41:43,610
为什么不打电话?
FRANK Why didn't you call?

2372
02:41:59,293 --> 02:42:02,587
我恨死你了

02:42:47,258 --> 02:42:53,346
我做了什么啊? 我他妈的怎么了这是!?
What the fuck am I doing? What the fuck am I doing?

2379
02:44:32,905 --> 02:44:36,407

Men who are vain look at their bald spot and say:

You know, I don't need anything. I look great the way I am.

天上在下青蛙!
Oh, there are frogs falling from the sky.

大家都知道 你不是要去花135美元
You all know you're not gonna spend $135 for it.

2388

任何事情都有可能发生
This is something that happens.

2398
02:52:26,044 --> 02:52:28,921
在回到被绞死的那三位囚犯

和那个业余潜水员
...and a scuba diver...

2400
02:52:32,050 --> 02:52:33,551
还有那场自杀
...and a suicide.

2401
02:52:43,061 --> 02:52:46,772
无数这样的故事 充满巧合和偶然
There are stories of coincidence and chance...

各种交叉和离奇
...and intersections, and strange things told...

2403
02:52:50,235 --> 02:52:53,738
如此这般的故事 谁人又可预料得到?
...and which is which, and who only knows?

2404
02:52:58,285 --> 02:53:00,119
而通常我们会说
And we generally say:

2405
02:53:00,287 --> 02:53:02,997
那种事也就电影里才有 我才不信呢
Well, if that was in a movie, l wouldn't believe it.

2406
02:53:03,165 --> 02:53:07,877
某某如何如何 遇见了某某 诸如此类的故事
Someone's so- and- so met someone else's so- and- so, and so on.

2407
02:53:08,045 --> 02:53:10,921
以敝人之见
And it is in the humble opinion of this narrator...

2408
02:53:11,089 --> 02:53:13,716
这样的奇闻轶事其实每天都在发生
...that strange things happen all the time.

2409
02:53:13,884 --> 02:53:15,718
日子就是过去 一天天过去
And so it goes, and so it goes.

2410
02:53:15,886 --> 02:53:17,803
书上说:
And the book says:

2411
02:53:17,971 --> 02:53:19,972
虽然时过境迁
We may be through with the past...

2412
02:53:20,140 --> 02:53:23,267
但我们不会改变
...but the past ain't through with us.

2413
02:53:27,147 --> 02:53:29,315
不好意思 杰克
PHlL: I'm sorry, Jack.

2414
02:53:29,483 --> 02:53:32,318
是医院打来的 琳达的事情
lt's the hospital calling about Linda.

2415
02:53:32,486 --> 02:53:35,529
- 谁? - 她现在在医院
- Who? - Linda. She's in the hospital...

2416
02:53:35,697 --> 02:53:40,076
我觉得既然你在 还是你跟他们谈比较合适
...and I figured you should probably talk to them since you're here.

2417
02:53:41,203 --> 02:53:42,787
你好?
Hello?

2418
02:53:44,122 --> 02:53:45,873
嗯 那个
Uh- huh. And what-

2419
02:53:47,834 --> 02:53:50,628
好的 好
Okay. Okay.

2420
02:53:50,796 --> 02:53:52,171
嗯
Uh....

2421
02:53:52,339 --> 02:53:54,673
她还好吗?
ls she gonna be all right?

2422
02:53:58,470 --> 02:54:00,054
哪里 ?
Where...?

2423
02:54:21,660 --> 02:54:24,328
能看到么 琳达? 很好
You with us, Linda? Good.

2424
02:54:24,496 --> 02:54:26,705
你是 琳达 对吗?
lt is Linda, isn't it?

2425
02:54:31,044 --> 02:54:34,463
放轻松 好
Just relax. That's it.

2426
02:54:36,133 --> 02:54:38,175
会好起来的
You'll get through this.

2427
02:54:49,437 --> 02:54:51,063
爸
Dad.

2428
02:54:54,276 --> 02:54:55,776
爸
Dad.

2429
02:54:58,738 --> 02:55:01,240
爸 你需要对我好一点
Dad, you need to be nicer to me.

2430
02:55:03,535 --> 02:55:05,161
睡觉去吧
Go to bed.

2431
02:55:06,413 --> 02:55:09,039
你必须今后对我好一点 爸
You have to be nicer to me, Dad.

2432
02:55:12,878 --> 02:55:14,461
睡觉去吧
Go to bed.

2433
02:55:22,971 --> 02:55:25,806
我知道自己做了件蠢事
I know I did a stupid thing.

2434
02:55:26,558 --> 02:55:28,809
太愚蠢了
So stupid.

2435
02:55:28,977 --> 02:55:31,312
戴牙箍
Getting braces.

2436
02:55:31,479 --> 02:55:33,189
我以为
I thought....

2437
02:55:34,774 --> 02:55:36,775
我以为这样他就会爱上我
I thought he would love me.

2438
02:55:36,943 --> 02:55:39,862
戴 牙箍
Getting braces.

2439
02:55:40,030 --> 02:55:41,113
图什么啊!?
For what?

2440
02:55:41,281 --> 02:55:45,409
为了些什么 我都根本
For something I don't even....

2441
02:55:47,454 --> 02:55:50,497
我根本连戴到哪颗牙都不知道啊
I don't know where to put things, you know?

2442
02:55:53,960 --> 02:55:56,712
我太想爱上一个人了
I really do have love to give.

2443
02:55:56,880 --> 02:56:00,382
只是不知道该爱谁
I just don't know where to put it.

2444
02:56:09,851 --> 02:56:13,562
大多数人以为我仅仅是在完成工作
A lot of people think this is just a job that you go to.

2445
02:56:15,273 --> 02:56:18,567
一顿饭时间 好吧 就完成了
Take a lunch hour. Job's over.

2446
02:56:18,735 --> 02:56:20,527
诸如此类的东西
Something like that.

2447
02:56:22,447 --> 02:56:25,032
但我把它当成我的人生
JlM: But it's a 24- hour deal.

2448
02:56:27,077 --> 02:56:29,161
没有退路
No two ways about it.

2449
02:56:30,288 --> 02:56:33,666
而大家都想象不到的是
And what most people don't see...

2450
02:56:35,085 --> 02:56:39,004
认认真真做对一件事需要多大的努力
...is just how hard it is to do the right thing.

2451
02:56:42,133 --> 02:56:44,009
大家以为 我下个处罚
People think if I make a judgment call...

2452
02:56:44,177 --> 02:56:47,721
下个判决就完事儿了 不仅仅是这样的
...that that's a judgment on them, but that is not what I do.

2453
02:56:49,015 --> 02:56:51,350
事情不应该就这么着了解的
And that's not what should be done.

2454
02:56:53,228 --> 02:56:55,854
我必须负担起一切
I have to take everything...

2455
02:56:56,022 --> 02:56:58,357
负责一切的正常运转
...and play as it lays.

2456
02:57:03,029 --> 02:57:05,531
有的人需要恩惠
Sometimes people need a little help.

2457
02:57:05,699 --> 02:57:09,034
我认识个家伙 很擅长做牙齿矫正手术的
I supposed to be real good at corrective oral surgery.

2458
02:57:13,790 --> 02:57:16,667
有的人需要宽恕
JlM: Sometimes people need to be forgiven.

2459
02:57:23,341 --> 02:57:25,801
有的人需要惩罚
And sometimes they need to go to jail.

2460
02:57:27,220 --> 02:57:30,055
给这人打电话吧 行吗?
Call me about that guy with the teeth, okay?

2461
02:57:31,308 --> 02:57:34,310
在我看来 这正是最需深思熟虑的一件事
JlM: And that is a very tricky thing on my part...

2462
02:57:36,187 --> 02:57:38,105
下判决
...making that call.

2463
02:57:41,901 --> 02:57:44,236
我是说 法律是无情的
I mean, the law is the law...

2464
02:57:45,322 --> 02:57:47,865
我当然不能违背法律
...and heck if I'm gonna break it.

2465
02:57:54,914 --> 02:57:57,291
但你依然能巧妙地饶恕别人
JlM: You can forgive someone.

2466
02:58:04,507 --> 02:58:06,592
嗯 这就是最难之处
Well, that's the tough part.

2467
02:58:12,515 --> 02:58:14,767
如何宽恕他?
What can we forgive?

2468
02:58:26,029 --> 02:58:28,113
乃是工作中最难之处
Tough part of the job.

2469
02:58:31,618 --> 02:58:34,203
乃是我沿街巡逻时最难之处
Tough part of walking down the street.

2470
02:59:31,553 --> 02:59:33,804
我来这里
JlM: I just wanted to come here...

2471
02:59:34,848 --> 02:59:37,266
我来这里是想对你说
To come here and say something.

2472
02:59:37,767 --> 02:59:40,978
一些必须说的话 你说过的
Say something important. Something that you said.

2473
02:59:42,063 --> 02:59:45,190
你说过我们得把一切说出来
You said we should say things and do things.

2474
02:59:45,358 --> 02:59:48,569
诚诚实实 毫无保留地
Not lie, not keep things back.

2475
02:59:48,736 --> 02:59:50,654
别让这些话闷在心里 让自己痛苦
These are the things that tear people up.

2476
02:59:50,822 --> 02:59:52,865
好吧 我现在就要说出来了
Well, I'm gonna do that.

2477
02:59:53,992 --> 02:59:56,618
照你说的那样 克劳迪娅
I'm gonna do what you said, Claudia.

2478
02:59:58,788 --> 03:00:01,540
我不能
I can't let this go.

2479
03:00:03,042 --> 03:00:05,043
我不能没有你
I can't let you go.

2480
03:00:09,966 --> 03:00:11,717
你 听着
Now, you...

2481
03:00:13,720 --> 03:00:15,888
好好听我说
You listen to me now.

2482
03:00:17,932 --> 03:00:20,267
你是个好女孩
You're a good person.

2483
03:00:22,479 --> 03:00:24,938
你是个美丽的好姑娘
A good, beautiful person...

2484
03:00:25,106 --> 03:00:27,733
我是不会让你离开我的
...and I won't let you walk out on me.

2485
03:00:29,652 --> 03:00:32,237
而且我决不会再让你说什么
I won't let you say those things.

2486
03:00:32,989 --> 03:00:36,658
说什么自己多傻多傻之类的傻话了
Those things about how stupid you are and this and that.

2487
03:00:37,744 --> 03:00:40,120
不会再让你这么说的
I won't stand for that.

2488
03:00:42,373 --> 03:00:44,583
你愿意的话
You want to be with me...

2489
03:00:46,920 --> 03:00:49,421
我们就在一起吧
...then you be with me.

怎么样?
You see?
