1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,731
Ladies and gentlemen, we're about to
begin our descent into Los Angeles.

2
00:00:24,505 --> 00:00:27,906
The sound you just heard is
the landing gear locking into place.

3
00:00:28,308 --> 00:00:31,903
Los Angeles weather is clear.
The temperature is 72.

4
00:00:32,312 --> 00:00:35,975
We expect to make our 4-hour
and 18-minute flight on schedule.

5
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,809
We have enjoyed having you on board

6
00:00:38,919 --> 00:00:41,615
and look forward to seeing you again
in the near future.

7
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:53,026
Please hold handrail
and stand to the right

8
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:56,625
if you wish to pass,
please do so on the left.

9
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:51,877
You attention, please. Parking in the area
is limited to three minutes only.

10
00:02:52,686 --> 00:02:55,655
Please do not leave your car unattended.

11
00:03:12,873 --> 00:03:15,808
Hey, what's the matter?

12
00:03:16,877 --> 00:03:20,176
The guests are all downstairs, Ben,
waiting to see you.

13
00:03:22,816 --> 00:03:26,684
Look, dad, could you explain
that I have to be alone for a while?

14
00:03:27,587 --> 00:03:29,782
These are all our good friends, Ben.

15
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:34,293
Most of them have known you since
well, practically since you were born.

16
00:03:34,795 --> 00:03:36,456
What is it, Ben?

17
00:03:37,397 --> 00:03:38,864
I'm just...

18
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,323
worried?

19
00:03:44,304 --> 00:03:45,999
Well...

20
00:03:46,707 --> 00:03:48,299
about what?

21
00:03:48,842 --> 00:03:51,140
I guess about my future.

22
00:03:53,747 --> 00:03:55,476
What about it?

23
00:03:55,816 --> 00:03:57,647
I don't know.

24
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:01,319
I want it to be...

25
00:04:02,322 --> 00:04:04,017
to be what?

26
00:04:06,626 --> 00:04:08,093
Different.

27
00:04:09,963 --> 00:04:11,954
- Is anything wrong?
- No, no.

28
00:04:12,065 --> 00:04:15,398
- We're just on our way downstairs.
- The Carlsons are here.

29
00:04:15,435 --> 00:04:17,528
They are? Well, come on.

30
00:04:17,637 --> 00:04:19,969
They came all the way from Tarzana.

31
00:04:20,373 --> 00:04:22,637
Come on, let's get cracking.

32
00:04:22,776 --> 00:04:25,973
It's a wonderful thing to have
so many devoted friends.

33
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,544
Hey, there's the award-winning scholar!

34
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,450
- We're all very proud of you, Ben.
- Thank you, Mrs. Carlsons.

35
00:04:32,552 --> 00:04:34,486
Is that the new car out there?
That little red wop job?

36
00:04:34,554 --> 00:04:35,851
That's Ben's graduation present.

37
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:37,447
You won't have much trouble
picking up in that, will you?

38
00:04:37,491 --> 00:04:38,651
Sir?

39
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:40,592
The girls, the chicks,
the teenyboppers.

40
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,563
I think Ben's gotten beyond
the teenybopper stage, haven't you, Ben?

41
00:04:43,563 --> 00:04:44,860
Yes, ma'am.

42
00:04:45,265 --> 00:04:48,701
Excuse me. I'd like to check
something on the car for a minute.

43
00:04:48,769 --> 00:04:51,533
His father bought him an Alfa Romeo.

44
00:04:52,572 --> 00:04:54,699
Hey, here's the track star.

45
00:04:54,808 --> 00:04:57,140
- How are you, track star?
- Just fine, Mr. Loomis.

46
00:04:57,177 --> 00:04:59,077
I want to get a drink, then
I want to hear all about

47
00:04:59,179 --> 00:05:01,113
that thing that you won,
that hopperman award.

48
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:03,342
- Halpingham.
- Halpingham. Right.

49
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:04,815
You wait right here.

50
00:05:09,022 --> 00:05:10,284
Ben!

51
00:05:11,324 --> 00:05:13,485
We're all so proud of you.

52
00:05:13,527 --> 00:05:17,190
Proud, proud, proud...

53
00:05:17,597 --> 00:05:19,292
What are you going to do now?

54
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:21,026
I was going to go
upstairs for a minute.

55
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:23,001
I meant with your future.

56
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:25,503
- Your life.
- Well, that's a little hard to say.

57
00:05:25,906 --> 00:05:27,703
- Ben.
- Excuse me.

58
00:05:28,408 --> 00:05:29,670
Mr. Mcguire.

59
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,772
Ben.

60
00:05:32,546 --> 00:05:33,843
Mr. Mcguire.

61
00:05:34,748 --> 00:05:37,308
Come with me a minute.
I want to talk to you.

62
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:38,941
Excuse us, Joanne.

63
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:41,112
- Of course.
- Thanks. Thank you

64
00:05:43,056 --> 00:05:44,580
Congratulations!

65
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:47,024
Look at him,
and I can't believe it.

66
00:05:49,863 --> 00:05:51,956
I just want to say one word to you.

67
00:05:52,566 --> 00:05:54,727
Just one word.

68
00:05:55,535 --> 00:05:57,025
Yes, sir.

69
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,831
- Are you listening?
- Yes, I am.

70
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:01,066
Plastics.

71
00:06:04,077 --> 00:06:05,806
Exactly how do you mean?

72
00:06:06,046 --> 00:06:07,775
There's a great future in plastics.

73
00:06:07,948 --> 00:06:09,745
Think about it.

74
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,511
- Will you think about it?
- Yes, I will.

75
00:06:11,585 --> 00:06:14,486
Shh! Enough said. That's a deal

76
00:06:14,888 --> 00:06:17,982
Here he is now. Here's Ben.

77
00:06:18,158 --> 00:06:19,955
Excuse me just a minute.

78
00:06:21,394 --> 00:06:24,591
Listen, everybody,
I want you all to be quiet.

79
00:06:24,664 --> 00:06:26,655
I've got Ben's college yearbook here,

80
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,033
and I just want to read you some of
the wonderful things about Ben.

81
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,630
Be quiet, please!

82
00:06:33,173 --> 00:06:36,472
Captain of the cross-country team,
head of the debating club,

83
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:40,068
associate editor of the college newspaper
in his junior year,

84
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,876
managing editor in his senior...

85
00:07:18,652 --> 00:07:21,678
Oh, I guess this isn't
the bathroom, is it?

86
00:07:21,955 --> 00:07:24,219
It's, uh, down the hall.

87
00:07:24,424 --> 00:07:27,621
- How are you, Benjamin?
- Fine, thank you, Mrs. Robinson.

88
00:07:27,727 --> 00:07:31,163
The bathroom's down
at the end of the hall.

89
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:33,922
Such a pleasant room.

90
00:07:34,134 --> 00:07:38,764
Look, uh... Mrs. Robinson,
I don't mean to be rude, but...

91
00:07:38,838 --> 00:07:41,136
- I'm awfully...
- Is there an ashtray in here?

92
00:07:42,575 --> 00:07:44,065
No.

93
00:07:44,444 --> 00:07:47,641
Oh, yes, I forgot the track star
doesn't smoke.

94
00:07:55,689 --> 00:07:57,384
Is it a girl

95
00:07:58,258 --> 00:07:59,725
Is what a girl

96
00:08:00,894 --> 00:08:02,759
Whatever it is that's upsetting you.

97
00:08:03,163 --> 00:08:07,099
Oh, no, I'm just, uh...
sort of disturbed about things.

98
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,868
- In general
- That's right.

99
00:08:12,472 --> 00:08:16,033
Well... congratulations.

100
00:08:16,076 --> 00:08:17,703
Thank you.

101
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,211
Oh, Benjamin.

102
00:08:22,582 --> 00:08:24,641
- I want to ask you something.
- What?

103
00:08:24,784 --> 00:08:26,615
- Will you take me home?
- What?

104
00:08:26,686 --> 00:08:28,677
My husband took the car.
Will you drive me home?

105
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,817
Here, you take it.

106
00:08:33,326 --> 00:08:35,294
You know how to work
a foreign shift?

107
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,159
- You don't?
- No

108
00:08:43,937 --> 00:08:45,598
Let's go.

109
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,595
- Thank you.
- Right.

110
00:09:32,852 --> 00:09:34,444
Will you come in, please?

111
00:09:34,554 --> 00:09:35,953
What?

112
00:09:36,056 --> 00:09:37,683
I'd like you to come in
till I get the lights on.

113
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,985
What for?

114
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:41,152
Because I don't feel safe
till I get the lights on.

115
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:01,745
Would you mind walking ahead
of me to the sun porch?

116
00:10:02,182 --> 00:10:04,412
I feel funny about
coming into a dark house.

117
00:10:04,584 --> 00:10:06,347
But it's light in there.

118
00:10:06,486 --> 00:10:07,953
Please.

119
00:10:32,545 --> 00:10:34,206
What do you drink? Bourbon?

120
00:10:34,914 --> 00:10:38,873
Look, Mrs. Robinson, I drove you
home, I was glad to do it.

121
00:10:38,952 --> 00:10:41,420
But I have some things on my mind.
Can you understand that?

122
00:10:41,654 --> 00:10:43,144
- Yes.
- All right.

123
00:10:44,424 --> 00:10:45,914
What do you drink?

124
00:10:48,428 --> 00:10:50,123
Benjamin, I'm sorry to be this way,

125
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,289
but I don't want to be left alone
in this house.

126
00:10:52,365 --> 00:10:53,559
Why not?

127
00:10:53,633 --> 00:10:55,328
Please wait till my husband gets home.

128
00:10:55,935 --> 00:10:57,266
When is he coming back?

129
00:10:57,637 --> 00:10:58,729
I don't know.

130
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,534
- Drink?
- No.

131
00:11:04,644 --> 00:11:06,805
Are you always this much
afraid of being alone?

132
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,345
Yes.

133
00:11:08,581 --> 00:11:10,947
Well, why can't you just lock
the doors and go to bed?

134
00:11:12,051 --> 00:11:13,678
I'm very neurotic.

135
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:29,330
May I ask you a question?

136
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,665
What do you think of me?

137
00:11:33,206 --> 00:11:34,639
What do you mean?

138
00:11:34,874 --> 00:11:37,775
You've known me nearly all your life.
You must've formed some opinion of me.

139
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:42,505
Well, I always thought that
you were a very nice person.

140
00:11:44,984 --> 00:11:47,384
Did you know I was an alcoholic?

141
00:11:50,191 --> 00:11:51,351
What?

142
00:11:51,492 --> 00:11:53,153
Did you know that?

143
00:11:54,895 --> 00:11:56,886
Look, I think I should be going.

144
00:11:57,031 --> 00:11:58,521
Sit down, Benjamin.

145
00:11:58,632 --> 00:12:00,827
Mrs. Robinson, if you
don't mind my saying so,

146
00:12:00,901 --> 00:12:03,062
this conversation
is getting a little strange.

147
00:12:03,204 --> 00:12:05,365
Now, I'm sure Mr. Robinson
will be here any minute...

148
00:12:05,406 --> 00:12:06,805
- No.
- What?

149
00:12:06,907 --> 00:12:08,932
My husband will be back quite late.

150
00:12:09,043 --> 00:12:11,102
He should be gone for several hours.

151
00:12:13,047 --> 00:12:15,345
- Oh, my God.
- Pardon?

152
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,475
Oh, no, Mrs. Robinson. Oh, no.

153
00:12:17,618 --> 00:12:19,051
What's wrong?

154
00:12:19,153 --> 00:12:21,849
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't...
I mean, you didn't expect...

155
00:12:21,922 --> 00:12:23,583
What?

156
00:12:23,657 --> 00:12:25,989
I mean, you didn't really think
I'd do something like that.

157
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,425
Like what?

158
00:12:27,528 --> 00:12:29,928
- What do you think?
- Well, I don't know.

159
00:12:30,264 --> 00:12:31,925
For God's sake,

160
00:12:32,066 --> 00:12:35,934
Mrs. Robinson. Here we are.
You got me into your house,

161
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,961
you give me a drink,
you put on music,

162
00:12:38,038 --> 00:12:40,404
now you start opening up
your personal life to me

163
00:12:40,441 --> 00:12:42,238
and telling me your husband
won't be home for hours.

164
00:12:42,276 --> 00:12:43,470
So?

165
00:12:43,544 --> 00:12:46,172
Mrs. Robinson, you're
trying to seduce me.

166
00:12:49,049 --> 00:12:50,380
Aren't you?

167
00:12:50,851 --> 00:12:52,819
Well, no, I hadn't thought of it.

168
00:12:52,886 --> 00:12:54,717
I feel very flattered.

169
00:12:54,755 --> 00:12:57,019
Will you forgive me
for what I just said?

170
00:12:57,157 --> 00:12:58,181
It's all right.

171
00:12:58,359 --> 00:13:00,088
It's not all right. It's the worst thing
I ever said to anyone.

172
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,718
Sit down.

173
00:13:02,363 --> 00:13:04,354
Please forgive me,
because I like you.

174
00:13:05,466 --> 00:13:07,161
I don't think of you that way,
but I'm mixed up.

175
00:13:07,268 --> 00:13:08,895
It's all right.
Finish your drink.

176
00:13:08,969 --> 00:13:10,766
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick
that I said that to you.

177
00:13:10,871 --> 00:13:13,169
We'll forget it right now.
Finish your drink.

178
00:13:14,775 --> 00:13:16,572
What is wrong with me?

179
00:13:16,677 --> 00:13:18,577
Have you ever seen
Elaine's portrait?

180
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,414
Wha... her portrait?

181
00:13:24,518 --> 00:13:26,179
- Yes.
- No.

182
00:13:26,287 --> 00:13:28,346
We had it done last christmas.
Would you like to see it?

183
00:13:28,489 --> 00:13:29,922
Very much.

184
00:13:34,128 --> 00:13:35,755
It's here in Elaine's room.

185
00:13:41,702 --> 00:13:44,398
Elaine certainly is
an attractive girl, isn't she?

186
00:13:47,608 --> 00:13:49,974
I don't remember her
as having brown eyes.

187
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,202
- Benjamin.
- Yes.

188
00:13:52,112 --> 00:13:53,477
Will you come over here a minute?

189
00:13:53,614 --> 00:13:55,047
- Over there?
- Mm Hmm.

190
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:56,411
Sure.

191
00:14:02,156 --> 00:14:03,589
Will you unzip my dress?

192
00:14:04,258 --> 00:14:05,555
I think I'll go to bed.

193
00:14:05,626 --> 00:14:06,854
Oh, well, good night.

194
00:14:06,927 --> 00:14:08,451
Won't you unzip my dress?

195
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:10,053
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.

196
00:14:10,164 --> 00:14:12,132
If you still think
I'm trying to seduce you...

197
00:14:12,232 --> 00:14:13,961
No, I don't, but I just
feel a little funny.

198
00:14:14,034 --> 00:14:15,626
Benjamin, you've known me all your life.

199
00:14:15,669 --> 00:14:18,399
- I know that, but I'm...
- Come on, it's hard for me to reach.

200
00:14:25,746 --> 00:14:27,179
- Thank you.
- Right.

201
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:30,610
What are you so scared of?

202
00:14:30,651 --> 00:14:32,380
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.

203
00:14:32,453 --> 00:14:34,080
Then why do you keep running away?

204
00:14:34,154 --> 00:14:36,952
Because you're going to bed.
I don't think I should be up here.

205
00:14:37,658 --> 00:14:39,888
Haven't you seen anybody
in a slip before?

206
00:14:39,993 --> 00:14:41,585
Yes, I have, but I just...

207
00:14:42,363 --> 00:14:44,763
Look, what if Mr. Robinson
walked in right now?

208
00:14:44,798 --> 00:14:45,856
What if he did?

209
00:14:45,966 --> 00:14:47,627
It would look pretty funny,
wouldn't it?

210
00:14:47,701 --> 00:14:49,225
Don't you think
he'd trust us together?

211
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,998
Of course, he does, but he might get
the wrong idea. Anyone might.

212
00:14:52,106 --> 00:14:55,337
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you.
How could anyone think...

213
00:14:55,376 --> 00:14:57,139
They would, don't you see?

214
00:14:57,211 --> 00:14:59,179
Benjamin, I am not
trying to seduce you.

215
00:14:59,213 --> 00:15:01,943
I know that, but please,
Mrs. Robinson, this is diffic...

216
00:15:02,015 --> 00:15:03,778
Would you like me to seduce you?

217
00:15:03,884 --> 00:15:05,010
What?

218
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:06,916
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

219
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:08,818
I'm going home now.

220
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:10,151
I apologize for what I said.

221
00:15:10,224 --> 00:15:12,715
I hope you can forget it,
but I'm going home right now.

222
00:15:15,996 --> 00:15:17,657
- Benjamin.
- Yes?

223
00:15:17,731 --> 00:15:19,699
Will you bring up
my purse before you go?

224
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,199
I have to go now.
I'm sorry.

225
00:15:21,301 --> 00:15:23,792
I really don't want to put this on again.
Won't you bring it up?

226
00:15:24,104 --> 00:15:26,629
- Where is it?
- On the table in the hall.

227
00:15:31,412 --> 00:15:33,937
- Mrs. Robinson?
- I'm in the bathroom.

228
00:15:34,047 --> 00:15:35,480
Well, here's the purse.

229
00:15:35,616 --> 00:15:37,174
Could you bring it up?

230
00:15:37,718 --> 00:15:40,653
Well, I'll hand it to you.
Come to the railing, and I'll hand it up.

231
00:15:40,821 --> 00:15:43,585
Benjamin, I'm getting
pretty tired of all the suspicion.

232
00:15:43,657 --> 00:15:46,251
Now, if you won't do me
a simple favor, I don't know what.

233
00:15:48,262 --> 00:15:50,230
I'm putting it on the top step.

234
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,927
For God's sake, Benjamin, will you stop
acting this way and bring me the purse?

235
00:15:57,838 --> 00:15:59,829
I'm putting it here by the door.

236
00:15:59,873 --> 00:16:02,273
- Will you bring it in to me?
- I'd rather not.

237
00:16:02,943 --> 00:16:06,140
All right. Put it in Elaine's room
where we were.

238
00:16:06,346 --> 00:16:07,540
Right.

239
00:16:18,292 --> 00:16:19,623
Oh, God.

240
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,252
Oh, let me out.

241
00:16:21,395 --> 00:16:23,363
- Don't be nervous.
- Get away from that door.

242
00:16:23,464 --> 00:16:25,455
- I want to say something first.
- Jesus christ.

243
00:16:25,566 --> 00:16:27,625
Benjamin, I want you to know
that I'm available to you,

244
00:16:27,668 --> 00:16:28,896
and if you won't
sleep with me this time...

245
00:16:29,002 --> 00:16:31,129
- Oh, my christ.
- Lf you won't sleep with me this time,

246
00:16:31,205 --> 00:16:33,173
I want you to know
you can call me up anytime,

247
00:16:33,207 --> 00:16:35,175
and we'll make some kind
of an arrangement.

248
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:37,006
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Let me out.

249
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,704
- Benjamin, do you understand?
- Yes, yes, let me out.

250
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,541
I find you very attractive.

251
00:16:41,815 --> 00:16:44,784
- And tell me what...
- Oh, Jesus, that's him!

252
00:16:55,596 --> 00:16:58,588
- Is that Ben's car in front?
- Yes, sir.

253
00:16:59,433 --> 00:17:02,493
I drove Mrs. Robinson home.

254
00:17:02,603 --> 00:17:05,697
She wanted me to drive her home,
so I drove her home.

255
00:17:06,406 --> 00:17:08,135
Swell. I appreciate it.

256
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,711
She's upstairs. She wanted me to
wait down here till you got home.

257
00:17:14,147 --> 00:17:16,547
Standing guard over
the old castle, are you?

258
00:17:16,617 --> 00:17:17,948
Yes, sir.

259
00:17:19,219 --> 00:17:21,187
Hey, congratulations.

260
00:17:21,421 --> 00:17:22,683
Thank you.

261
00:17:23,323 --> 00:17:26,349
- Looks like you need a refill.
- No, I've got to go.

262
00:17:26,827 --> 00:17:28,920
Is anything wrong?

263
00:17:29,763 --> 00:17:31,458
You look a little shaken up.

264
00:17:31,532 --> 00:17:34,524
Oh, no, I'm just a little
worried about my future.

265
00:17:35,035 --> 00:17:37,026
I'm a little upset about my future.

266
00:17:38,171 --> 00:17:40,833
Come on, let's have
a nightcap together.

267
00:17:40,974 --> 00:17:42,464
Scotch?

268
00:17:42,643 --> 00:17:44,042
Bourbon.

269
00:17:46,446 --> 00:17:47,777
Ben...

270
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,984
How old are you now?

271
00:17:52,553 --> 00:17:54,885
20.
I'll be 21 next week.

272
00:18:06,767 --> 00:18:08,667
That's a hell of a good age to be.

273
00:18:08,769 --> 00:18:10,100
Thank you.

274
00:18:13,473 --> 00:18:14,838
Thank you very much, sir.

275
00:18:22,115 --> 00:18:26,279
I, uh... I wish I was that age again.

276
00:18:27,487 --> 00:18:29,250
- Because, Ben...
- Sir?

277
00:18:30,824 --> 00:18:33,292
You'll never be young again.

278
00:18:33,427 --> 00:18:34,587
I know.

279
00:18:42,235 --> 00:18:45,363
Ben, can I say something to you?

280
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:46,699
What?

281
00:18:48,942 --> 00:18:53,242
Uh, how long have we
known each other now?

282
00:18:54,748 --> 00:18:58,445
How long have you and
I known each other?

283
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:02,948
How long have your dad
and I been partners?

284
00:19:03,023 --> 00:19:04,354
Quite a while.

285
00:19:12,065 --> 00:19:14,431
- I watched you grow up, Ben.
- Yes, sir.

286
00:19:17,037 --> 00:19:20,837
In many ways, I feel as though
you were my own son.

287
00:19:21,341 --> 00:19:22,603
Thank you.

288
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,946
So I hope you won't mind my giving
you a friendly piece of advice.

289
00:19:33,754 --> 00:19:35,278
I'd like to hear it.

290
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,093
Ben...

291
00:19:41,795 --> 00:19:43,387
I think...

292
00:19:44,097 --> 00:19:46,292
I think you ought
to be taking it...

293
00:19:46,366 --> 00:19:49,426
a little easier right now
than you seem to be.

294
00:19:50,871 --> 00:19:54,705
Sow a few wild oats.
Take things as they come.

295
00:19:55,275 --> 00:19:57,869
Have a good time with
the girls and so forth.

296
00:19:58,412 --> 00:19:59,970
Don't get up.

297
00:20:02,082 --> 00:20:05,347
I, uh... I was just telling...

298
00:20:05,986 --> 00:20:10,548
Ben here that he ought to sow
a few wild oats,

299
00:20:10,924 --> 00:20:13,950
have a good time while he can.
You think that's sound advice?

300
00:20:14,194 --> 00:20:15,525
Yes, I do.

301
00:20:16,096 --> 00:20:17,586
I've got to go.

302
00:20:19,099 --> 00:20:23,399
You have yourself
a few flings this summer.

303
00:20:23,503 --> 00:20:26,404
I bet you're quite a ladies' man.

304
00:20:26,506 --> 00:20:28,599
- Oh, no.
- What?

305
00:20:29,109 --> 00:20:33,705
You look to me like the kind of
guy who has to fight them off.

306
00:20:33,814 --> 00:20:37,511
Doesn't he look to you like the kind
of guy who has to fight them off?

307
00:20:37,617 --> 00:20:38,948
Yes, he does.

308
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:43,681
Oh, say, um... Elaine gets down
from Berkeley on Saturday.

309
00:20:43,824 --> 00:20:45,917
- Oh, yes.
- I want you give her a call.

310
00:20:46,026 --> 00:20:47,550
I will.

311
00:20:48,428 --> 00:20:49,918
Benjamin.

312
00:20:51,331 --> 00:20:52,730
- Benjamin?
- Yes.

313
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,494
Thank you for taking me home.

314
00:20:54,835 --> 00:20:56,496
I'll see you soon, I hope.

315
00:20:59,639 --> 00:21:02,369
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please.

316
00:21:02,542 --> 00:21:05,204
Uh, for this afternoon's
feature attraction...

317
00:21:05,345 --> 00:21:06,778
Hey, over there!

318
00:21:07,147 --> 00:21:08,808
Yes, I mean you.

319
00:21:08,982 --> 00:21:10,643
Your attention, please.

320
00:21:11,685 --> 00:21:14,745
Are you ready in there,
feature attraction?

321
00:21:14,855 --> 00:21:16,652
Could I speak to you for a second, dad?

322
00:21:16,757 --> 00:21:20,090
Listen, I'm going to ask
for a big round of applause

323
00:21:20,193 --> 00:21:21,956
to bring this boy
out here, all right?

324
00:21:22,062 --> 00:21:24,155
No, wait a minute.
Let me amend that.

325
00:21:24,498 --> 00:21:27,092
To bring this young man out here,

326
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,397
because today he is 21 years old.

327
00:21:30,504 --> 00:21:33,405
Yeah! Let's go!
Our food's cold.

328
00:21:33,473 --> 00:21:35,907
Oh, now just hang on a minute,
I've got a few words to say.

329
00:21:36,009 --> 00:21:37,601
You always do.

330
00:21:37,677 --> 00:21:39,702
Ho ho ho!
Look who's talking.

331
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,171
Dad, can we just talk about
this for a second?

332
00:21:43,283 --> 00:21:45,979
I can't hold them much longer, Ben.
You better get out here.

333
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:47,643
I'd like to discuss this.

334
00:21:47,788 --> 00:21:50,313
This boy... I'm sorry,
this young man,

335
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:53,951
is soon to continue his education as
a frank Halpingham award scholar,

336
00:21:55,495 --> 00:21:57,656
but before he does...

337
00:21:57,898 --> 00:21:59,923
before he does...

338
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,828
You're disappointing them, Ben.
You're disappointing them!

339
00:22:04,037 --> 00:22:06,767
- Dad, can you listen?
- I'll give you 10 seconds.

340
00:22:07,407 --> 00:22:11,343
He is going to give us
a practical demonstration of what...

341
00:22:11,411 --> 00:22:14,812
I feel safe in saying is a pretty
exciting birthday present.

342
00:22:15,615 --> 00:22:18,607
And it better work,
or I'm out over 200 bucks.

343
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:24,052
Ok, then, let's hear it now
for Benjamin Braddock!

344
00:22:24,157 --> 00:22:26,318
Yay!

345
00:22:26,526 --> 00:22:29,324
Come out, Benjy!
Come on, Benjy!

346
00:22:29,429 --> 00:22:31,920
Let's hear it now!
Thatta boy!

347
00:22:32,866 --> 00:22:37,735
Well, folks, this remarkable young man
is going to perform for you

348
00:22:37,871 --> 00:22:44,743
some spectacular and amazing feats of
daring in water that is over 6 feet deep!

349
00:24:36,757 --> 00:24:37,951
Hello?

350
00:24:39,994 --> 00:24:42,360
I don't quite know how to put this.

351
00:24:42,463 --> 00:24:43,987
Benjamin?

352
00:24:44,465 --> 00:24:48,367
Look, I was thinking
about that time after the party...

353
00:24:48,469 --> 00:24:49,993
Where are you?

354
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:52,437
And I was wondering if I could
buy you a drink or something.

355
00:24:52,573 --> 00:24:53,972
Where are you?

356
00:24:54,008 --> 00:24:57,102
- Uh, the Taft Hotel
- Did you get a room?

357
00:24:58,779 --> 00:24:59,973
No.

358
00:25:01,015 --> 00:25:03,142
Now, I know it's pretty late,
and if you'd rather...

359
00:25:03,217 --> 00:25:04,946
- Give me an hour.
- What?

360
00:25:05,019 --> 00:25:06,452
I'll be there in an hour.

361
00:26:25,199 --> 00:26:26,894
It's in the main ballroom.

362
00:26:27,201 --> 00:26:28,600
Over there.

363
00:26:38,879 --> 00:26:40,437
Can I help you, sir?

364
00:26:40,481 --> 00:26:43,177
What?
Oh, no, I'm just...

365
00:26:43,684 --> 00:26:45,743
Are you here for an affair, sir?

366
00:26:48,589 --> 00:26:51,387
- What?
- The Singleman party, sir?

367
00:26:51,525 --> 00:26:54,119
Oh, yes.
The singleman party.

368
00:26:54,295 --> 00:26:57,355
- It's in the main ballroom.
- Ahh. Thank you.

369
00:27:14,849 --> 00:27:16,441
- Hello.
- Hello.

370
00:27:16,517 --> 00:27:19,247
- You must be one of the porters.
- No, actually I'm not.

371
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,050
Yes. I'd like you to meet
my sister, Miss Dewitte.

372
00:27:22,723 --> 00:27:24,850
- How do you do?
- How do you do Miss Dewitte?

373
00:27:24,925 --> 00:27:26,552
And that's my husband
Mr. Singleman.

374
00:27:26,627 --> 00:27:29,061
- Oh, sorry.
- That's Jeffrey, of course.

375
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,428
Of course.
I didn't get your name, sir.

376
00:27:31,532 --> 00:27:34,228
- Benjamin Braddock, sir.
- Braddock, Braddock...

377
00:27:34,335 --> 00:27:35,859
- Yes, but I'm afraid...
- No, no no...

378
00:27:35,936 --> 00:27:37,426
I'll find your table in just a moment.

379
00:27:37,471 --> 00:27:39,371
Braddock. Braddock.
Not braniff.

380
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,839
We have a Braniff.

381
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:44,643
No, actually,
I'm just looking for a friend.

382
00:27:44,678 --> 00:27:46,373
Well, I don't understand.

383
00:27:46,447 --> 00:27:48,176
I'm not with your party.
I'm sorry.

384
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,580
Hey, I don't get it.

385
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:52,848
I've enjoyed meeting
you, Mr. Braniff.

386
00:28:43,037 --> 00:28:45,232
- Hello Benjamin?
- Oh, hello.

387
00:28:46,907 --> 00:28:49,273
- May I sit down?
- Of course.

388
00:28:49,743 --> 00:28:51,574
Thank you.

389
00:28:52,112 --> 00:28:55,275
- How are you?
- Very well, thank you.

390
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,652
- May I have a drink?
- A drink? Of course.

391
00:29:05,926 --> 00:29:07,951
- He didn't see me.
- Waiter.

392
00:29:08,562 --> 00:29:10,655
- I will have a martini.
- Yes, ma'am.

393
00:29:13,734 --> 00:29:16,134
You don't have to be
so nervous, you know.

394
00:29:16,237 --> 00:29:17,534
Nervous?

395
00:29:17,638 --> 00:29:21,267
Well, I am a bit nervous. I mean,
it's pretty hard to be suave when you're...

396
00:29:22,042 --> 00:29:24,135
- Did you get us a room?
- What?

397
00:29:24,245 --> 00:29:25,678
Have you gotten us a room yet?

398
00:29:25,746 --> 00:29:27,179
I haven't, no.

399
00:29:27,248 --> 00:29:28,840
Do you want to?

400
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:31,609
Well, I don't...
I mean, I could.

401
00:29:31,685 --> 00:29:33,346
Or we could just talk.

402
00:29:34,154 --> 00:29:35,644
You want me to get it?

403
00:29:35,756 --> 00:29:37,485
No, no, I'll get it.

404
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:40,852
- Do you want to get it now?
- Now?

405
00:29:40,894 --> 00:29:42,486
Yes.

406
00:29:43,264 --> 00:29:45,061
Well, I don't know.

407
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:47,358
- Why don't you get it?
- Why don't I get it?

408
00:29:47,768 --> 00:29:49,736
Well, I will, then,
if you'll excuse me.

409
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,610
Excuse me.

410
00:30:09,323 --> 00:30:10,722
Yes, sir?

411
00:30:11,592 --> 00:30:13,389
A room.
I'd like a room, please.

412
00:30:13,794 --> 00:30:15,591
A single room
or a double room?

413
00:30:15,696 --> 00:30:17,687
A single, just for myself, please.

414
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:19,425
Sign the register, please.

415
00:30:24,805 --> 00:30:27,035
- Anything wrong, sir?
- What? No, nothing.

416
00:30:36,317 --> 00:30:38,751
Do you have any luggage,
Mr. Gladstone?

417
00:30:39,553 --> 00:30:42,147
Luggage? Yes, yes, I do.

418
00:30:42,323 --> 00:30:44,086
- Where is it?
- What?

419
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,748
Where is your luggage?

420
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,128
It's in the car.
It's out there in the car.

421
00:30:49,229 --> 00:30:51,026
Very good, sir.
I'll have a porter bring it in.

422
00:30:51,131 --> 00:30:52,496
Oh, no.

423
00:30:53,033 --> 00:30:54,557
I mean, I'd...

424
00:30:54,635 --> 00:30:57,695
I'd rather not go to all
the trouble of bringing it all in.

425
00:30:57,771 --> 00:30:59,739
I just have a toothbrush.

426
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,330
I can get it myself,
if that's all right.

427
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:02,534
Of course.

428
00:31:02,643 --> 00:31:04,304
I'll have a porter
show you the room.

429
00:31:04,378 --> 00:31:07,836
Oh, well, actually, I'd just
as soon find it myself.

430
00:31:08,248 --> 00:31:10,580
I just have the toothbrush
to carry up.

431
00:31:10,884 --> 00:31:12,613
I can handle it myself.

432
00:31:12,953 --> 00:31:14,716
Whatever you say, sir.

433
00:31:14,788 --> 00:31:16,153
Thank you.

434
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,657
- Mrs. Robinson?
- Yes?

435
00:31:21,762 --> 00:31:22,990
For you.

436
00:31:23,063 --> 00:31:24,462
Thank you.

437
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:31,629
- Hello.
- Mrs. Robinson?

438
00:31:31,772 --> 00:31:33,296
- Yes?
- It's Benjamin.

439
00:31:33,374 --> 00:31:34,864
Yes?

440
00:31:34,975 --> 00:31:36,408
Benjamin Braddock.

441
00:31:37,177 --> 00:31:38,804
Benjamin, where are you?

442
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,407
Can you look through the glass?

443
00:31:46,186 --> 00:31:48,416
- Can you see me now?
- Yes, I can.

444
00:31:48,622 --> 00:31:51,318
- I got a single room.
- That's fine.

445
00:31:51,392 --> 00:31:52,984
But there's one thing...

446
00:31:53,093 --> 00:31:55,891
The desk clerk seemed
to be a little bit suspicious.

447
00:31:55,996 --> 00:31:57,793
Now, I don't know
what the policy...

448
00:31:57,931 --> 00:32:00,764
- Do you want to go up first?
- Yes, I think that would be good.

449
00:32:00,834 --> 00:32:02,426
I'll be up in 5 minutes.

450
00:32:02,836 --> 00:32:04,360
- Good-bye, then.
- Benjamin.

451
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:05,767
Yes?

452
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:07,431
Isn't there something
you want to tell me?

453
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:08,736
- Tell you?
- Yes.

454
00:32:09,309 --> 00:32:13,973
Well, I want you to know
how much I appreciate this. Really.

455
00:32:14,114 --> 00:32:15,638
- The number.
- What?

456
00:32:15,816 --> 00:32:18,216
The room number, Benjamin.
I think you ought to tell me that.

457
00:32:18,318 --> 00:32:20,081
You're absolutely right.

458
00:32:21,655 --> 00:32:23,885
It's 568.

459
00:32:24,324 --> 00:32:26,724
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

460
00:32:28,228 --> 00:32:29,422
Well...

461
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:32,328
I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson.

462
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,671
Check, please.

463
00:32:43,644 --> 00:32:45,305
- I got it.
- Hmm?

464
00:32:45,379 --> 00:32:46,846
- I say I got it.
- Sir?

465
00:32:46,947 --> 00:32:48,437
The toothbrush.
I got it, all right.

466
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:49,982
- Very good, sir.
- Yes.

467
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:52,142
- Well, good night.
- Good night, sir.

468
00:34:44,464 --> 00:34:45,726
Hello, Benjamin.

469
00:34:46,868 --> 00:34:48,358
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.

470
00:35:21,736 --> 00:35:22,930
Well.

471
00:35:23,304 --> 00:35:24,635
Well.

472
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,337
Benjamin...

473
00:35:28,343 --> 00:35:29,742
Yes.

474
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,602
I'll get undressed now.
Is that all right?

475
00:35:31,646 --> 00:35:32,704
Sure.

476
00:35:32,947 --> 00:35:35,780
Shall I...
I mean, should I just stand here?

477
00:35:36,351 --> 00:35:38,410
I mean, I don't know
what you want me to do.

478
00:35:38,753 --> 00:35:41,051
- Why don't you watch?
- Oh, sure. Thank you.

479
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,281
- Will you bring me a hanger?
- What?

480
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:45,625
- A hanger.
- Oh, yes.

481
00:35:51,866 --> 00:35:53,094
Wood?

482
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,394
What?

483
00:35:54,936 --> 00:35:56,460
Wood or wire?
They have both.

484
00:35:56,838 --> 00:35:58,897
- Either one would be fine.
- Ok.

485
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,448
Thank you.

486
00:36:17,859 --> 00:36:19,554
Would you help me
with this, please?

487
00:36:19,661 --> 00:36:20,923
Certainly.

488
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:26,131
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

489
00:36:46,187 --> 00:36:48,280
Benjamin, would this be
easier for you in the dark?

490
00:36:48,423 --> 00:36:50,391
Mrs. Robinson, I can't do this.

491
00:36:50,491 --> 00:36:52,322
- You what?
- This is all terribly wrong.

492
00:36:53,027 --> 00:36:55,359
- Do you find me undesirable?
- Oh, no, Mrs. Robinson.

493
00:36:55,396 --> 00:36:58,229
I think you're the most attractive
of all my parents' friends.

494
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:00,563
I mean that.
I find you desirable, but I...

495
00:37:00,835 --> 00:37:03,099
For God's sake,
can you imagine my parents?

496
00:37:03,204 --> 00:37:05,866
Can you imagine what they'd say if they
just saw us here in this room right now?

497
00:37:06,007 --> 00:37:08,373
- What would they say?
- I have no idea, Mrs. Robinson,

498
00:37:08,409 --> 00:37:09,967
but for God's sake.

499
00:37:10,111 --> 00:37:11,840
They brought me up.
They made a good life for me,

500
00:37:11,913 --> 00:37:13,847
and I think they deserve better than this.

501
00:37:13,915 --> 00:37:16,907
I think they deserve a little better than
jumping into bed with the partner's wife.

502
00:37:16,951 --> 00:37:18,282
Are you afraid of me?

503
00:37:18,352 --> 00:37:20,820
Oh, no, you're missing the point.
Look...

504
00:37:21,422 --> 00:37:23,447
Maybe we could do
something else together.

505
00:37:23,858 --> 00:37:26,326
Mrs. Robinson, would you
like to go to a movie?

506
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,025
Can I ask you
a personal question?

507
00:37:31,132 --> 00:37:33,293
- Ask me anything you want.
- Is this your first time?

508
00:37:33,534 --> 00:37:35,365
- Is this what?
- It is, isn't it?

509
00:37:35,436 --> 00:37:36,767
It is your first time.

510
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:39,533
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson.
That's really a laugh.

511
00:37:39,941 --> 00:37:42,375
- You can admit that, can't you?
- Are you kidding?

512
00:37:42,443 --> 00:37:44,104
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

513
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,509
- Wait a minute.
- On your first time...

514
00:37:45,546 --> 00:37:47,309
Who said it was my first time?
Wait a minute.

515
00:37:47,381 --> 00:37:49,474
Just because you happen
to be inadequate.

516
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,949
Inadequate?

517
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,157
- Well, I guess I better...
- Don't move!

518
00:42:54,855 --> 00:42:56,447
Ben, what are you doing?

519
00:43:00,461 --> 00:43:05,660
Well, I would say that I'm just
drifting here in the pool

520
00:43:05,766 --> 00:43:07,131
Why?

521
00:43:08,302 --> 00:43:10,793
Well, it's very comfortable
just to drift here.

522
00:43:12,373 --> 00:43:14,307
Have you thought
about graduate school

523
00:43:14,375 --> 00:43:15,637
No.

524
00:43:15,776 --> 00:43:19,473
Would you mind telling me what
those 4 years of college were for?

525
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:21,845
What was the point
of all that hard work?

526
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,347
You got me.

527
00:43:23,484 --> 00:43:25,111
Now, listen, Ben...

528
00:43:27,088 --> 00:43:28,419
Look.

529
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:31,950
I think it's a very good thing
that a young man,

530
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:34,494
after he's done some very good work,

531
00:43:34,795 --> 00:43:38,253
should have a chance
to relax and enjoy himself

532
00:43:38,799 --> 00:43:41,131
and lie around and
drink beer and so on.

533
00:43:41,836 --> 00:43:44,066
But after a few weeks,

534
00:43:44,438 --> 00:43:48,704
I believe that person would want to take
some stock in himself and his situation

535
00:43:48,843 --> 00:43:51,539
and start to think about
getting off his ass.

536
00:43:52,313 --> 00:43:54,474
Robinsons are here.

537
00:43:57,351 --> 00:44:00,411
Hi, Ben. What are you doing
with yourself these days?

538
00:44:00,521 --> 00:44:02,421
Oh, not too much.

539
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,315
Taking it easy.

540
00:44:05,459 --> 00:44:08,326
That's what I'd do if I could.
Nothing wrong with that.

541
00:44:08,829 --> 00:44:12,128
Hey, Ben. Elaine's coming down
from Berkeley soon.

542
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:14,030
I want you to call her up this time.

543
00:44:14,135 --> 00:44:15,432
I will.

544
00:44:15,536 --> 00:44:18,471
Because I just think you two would
hit it off real well together.

545
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,772
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.

546
00:44:24,945 --> 00:44:26,537
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.

547
00:44:27,181 --> 00:44:28,648
Hello, Benjamin.

548
00:44:41,962 --> 00:44:44,260
- Oh, my.
- Hi.

549
00:44:44,965 --> 00:44:47,695
- Hi. Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.

550
00:44:48,802 --> 00:44:50,064
Benjy...

551
00:44:50,804 --> 00:44:52,931
Darling, I'm going to
ask you something, but you...

552
00:44:53,007 --> 00:44:55,805
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

553
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:57,437
What?

554
00:44:57,912 --> 00:45:02,178
Well, I'm going to ask you what
you do when you go off at night.

555
00:45:03,884 --> 00:45:05,010
When I go off?

556
00:45:06,387 --> 00:45:08,082
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

557
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:10,189
No, I do.
I want to tell you.

558
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,089
I drive around.

559
00:45:14,595 --> 00:45:16,187
- What else?
- Nothing else.

560
00:45:16,997 --> 00:45:19,898
You don't drive around from midnight
until noon the next day, Benjamin.

561
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,331
Oh, no.

562
00:45:21,402 --> 00:45:22,699
Well, then, what do you do?

563
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:24,968
You meet someone?

564
00:45:25,105 --> 00:45:26,538
Meet someone?

565
00:45:26,707 --> 00:45:29,005
- Why do you say that?
- Well, this is your business.

566
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:31,644
- I won't play games with you.
- Wait, wait.

567
00:45:32,213 --> 00:45:34,943
I don't meet anyone, mother,
but why do you say that?

568
00:45:36,016 --> 00:45:38,541
Benjamin, I don't want
to pry into your affairs,

569
00:45:38,619 --> 00:45:41,747
but I would rather you didn't say
anything at all than be dishonest.

570
00:45:42,223 --> 00:45:43,815
- Good night.
- Well, wait...

571
00:45:44,058 --> 00:45:45,491
Wait a minute!

572
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,657
Will you wait a minute, please?

573
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:56,292
Mrs. Robinson, do you think we could say
a few words to each other first this time?

574
00:45:57,438 --> 00:45:59,736
I don't think we have much
to say to each other.

575
00:46:04,745 --> 00:46:08,875
Look, for months, all we've done is
come up here and leap into bed together.

576
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:11,042
Are you tired of it?

577
00:46:11,252 --> 00:46:12,981
I'm not, no.

578
00:46:13,153 --> 00:46:16,486
But do you think we could liven it up
with a little conversation for a change?

579
00:46:16,558 --> 00:46:18,082
What do you want to talk about?

580
00:46:18,193 --> 00:46:20,286
Anything.
Anything at all.

581
00:46:21,096 --> 00:46:23,929
Do you want to tell me about
some of your college experiences?

582
00:46:24,165 --> 00:46:25,723
Oh, my God.

583
00:46:30,105 --> 00:46:31,732
Think of another topic.

584
00:46:41,583 --> 00:46:43,107
How about art?

585
00:46:43,585 --> 00:46:45,610
Art. That's a good subject.

586
00:46:45,687 --> 00:46:47,120
You start it off.

587
00:46:47,289 --> 00:46:49,553
You start it off.
I don't know anything about it.

588
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:51,552
Well, what do you want
to know about it?

589
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:54,354
Are you interested more
in modern art or in classical art?

590
00:46:54,596 --> 00:46:55,858
Neither.

591
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:57,454
- You're not interested in art?
- No.

592
00:46:57,532 --> 00:46:58,897
Then why do you want
to talk about it?

593
00:46:59,000 --> 00:46:59,989
I don't.

594
00:47:00,101 --> 00:47:02,661
Now, look, we're going to do this thing.
We're going to have a conversation.

595
00:47:03,405 --> 00:47:04,804
Tell me what you did today.

596
00:47:07,108 --> 00:47:08,769
I got up.

597
00:47:09,811 --> 00:47:12,302
- I fixed breakfast for my husband.
- There.

598
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:15,739
There's something we could have
a conversation about... your husband.

599
00:47:16,051 --> 00:47:17,484
Oh. Him.

600
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:19,316
I mean, everything.

601
00:47:19,454 --> 00:47:21,945
I don't know anything
about how you work this.

602
00:47:22,223 --> 00:47:24,157
What do you say to him when
you leave the house at night?

603
00:47:24,259 --> 00:47:25,749
Nothing. He's asleep.

604
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,191
Always?

605
00:47:27,429 --> 00:47:29,021
Doesn't he wake up
when you come home?

606
00:47:31,132 --> 00:47:33,123
We have separate bedrooms.

607
00:47:33,168 --> 00:47:34,635
Oh, I see.

608
00:47:35,036 --> 00:47:36,799
So you don't...

609
00:47:37,238 --> 00:47:40,901
I don't like to seem like I'm prying,
but I guess you don't sleep together.

610
00:47:41,343 --> 00:47:42,742
No, we don't.

611
00:47:43,144 --> 00:47:44,634
How long has this been going on?

612
00:47:44,679 --> 00:47:46,704
- For God's sake, let's drop this.
- Wait a minute.

613
00:47:46,881 --> 00:47:48,212
Why did you marry him?

614
00:47:48,883 --> 00:47:50,316
See if you can guess.

615
00:47:50,752 --> 00:47:52,014
Well, I can't.

616
00:47:52,354 --> 00:47:54,322
Think real hard, Benjamin.

617
00:47:54,889 --> 00:47:56,652
I can't see why you did, unless...

618
00:47:57,692 --> 00:47:59,887
You didn't have to marry him
or anything, did you?

619
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:09,937
Don't tell Elaine.

620
00:48:10,372 --> 00:48:13,000
Oh, no. You had to marry him
because you got pregnant.

621
00:48:13,575 --> 00:48:14,872
Are you shocked?

622
00:48:17,178 --> 00:48:19,578
I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson
as the kind of people who...

623
00:48:19,614 --> 00:48:22,276
All right now, let's get to bed.

624
00:48:22,317 --> 00:48:24,080
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

625
00:48:25,587 --> 00:48:26,645
So how did it happen?

626
00:48:27,522 --> 00:48:29,547
- What?
- You and Mr. Robinson.

627
00:48:29,691 --> 00:48:32,216
Do you feel like telling me what
were the circumstances?

628
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:34,556
Not particularly.

629
00:48:35,096 --> 00:48:37,929
- Was he a law student at the time?
- Mm-hmm.

630
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,060
- And you were a student also?
- Mm-hmm.

631
00:48:42,404 --> 00:48:43,769
At college?

632
00:48:44,305 --> 00:48:45,795
Yes.

633
00:48:46,441 --> 00:48:47,703
What was your major?

634
00:48:51,946 --> 00:48:55,006
Benjamin, why are you asking me
all these questions?

635
00:48:55,116 --> 00:48:57,414
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson.

636
00:48:57,552 --> 00:48:59,816
What was your major
subject at college?

637
00:49:02,323 --> 00:49:04,120
- Art.
- Art?

638
00:49:06,828 --> 00:49:08,125
But I thought you...

639
00:49:13,635 --> 00:49:16,763
I guess you kind of lost interest in it
over the years, then.

640
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,737
Kind of.

641
00:49:22,143 --> 00:49:23,576
Well, how did it happen?

642
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:27,011
- What?
- You and Mr. Robinson.

643
00:49:27,749 --> 00:49:29,148
How do you think?

644
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:31,275
Did you take you up to
his room with him?

645
00:49:31,352 --> 00:49:32,683
Did you go to a hotel

646
00:49:32,787 --> 00:49:35,051
Oh, Benjamin,
what does it possibly matter?

647
00:49:35,156 --> 00:49:36,384
I'm curious.

648
00:49:36,958 --> 00:49:39,756
- We'd go to his car.
- Oh, no.

649
00:49:40,261 --> 00:49:41,694
In the car you did it?

650
00:49:42,163 --> 00:49:43,721
Well, I don't think
we were the first.

651
00:49:44,265 --> 00:49:45,630
What kind of car was it?

652
00:49:47,769 --> 00:49:48,929
What?

653
00:49:49,471 --> 00:49:51,166
Do you remember
the make of the car?

654
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:54,431
- Oh, my God.
- Really, I want to know.

655
00:49:54,576 --> 00:49:56,544
It was a Ford, Benjamin.

656
00:49:56,611 --> 00:49:58,078
A Ford.

657
00:49:58,313 --> 00:50:02,716
A Ford. God damn it, that's great.
A Ford.

658
00:50:03,585 --> 00:50:05,143
That's enough.

659
00:50:08,323 --> 00:50:12,089
So old Elaine Robinson
got started in a Ford.

660
00:50:13,328 --> 00:50:15,125
Don't talk about Elaine.

661
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:16,822
Don't talk about Elaine?

662
00:50:17,332 --> 00:50:18,492
No.

663
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,658
Why not?

664
00:50:21,102 --> 00:50:22,694
Because I don't want you to.

665
00:50:22,904 --> 00:50:24,337
Well, why don't you?

666
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:26,197
I wish you'd tell me.

667
00:50:26,341 --> 00:50:27,831
There's nothing to tell.

668
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:30,600
Well, why is she a big taboo
subject all of a sudden?

669
00:50:32,313 --> 00:50:36,217
Well, I guess I'll have to ask her out on
a date and find out what the big deal is.

670
00:50:36,217 --> 00:50:40,119
Benjamin, don't you ever
take that girl out.

671
00:50:40,221 --> 00:50:41,654
Do you understand that?

672
00:50:41,823 --> 00:50:43,848
I have no intention of taking her out.

673
00:50:46,728 --> 00:50:48,127
Good.

674
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:50,727
I was just kidding around.

675
00:50:53,468 --> 00:50:54,935
Good.

676
00:50:56,237 --> 00:50:57,568
Well, why shouldn't I

677
00:51:02,176 --> 00:51:04,041
- I have my reasons.
- Then let's hear them.

678
00:51:04,145 --> 00:51:05,203
No.

679
00:51:05,246 --> 00:51:07,942
Let's hear them, Mrs. Robinson,
because I think I know what they are.

680
00:51:08,483 --> 00:51:10,815
I'm not good enough for her
to associate with, am I

681
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:13,249
I'm not good enough to
even talk about her, am I

682
00:51:13,388 --> 00:51:15,356
- Let's drop it.
- We're not dropping it.

683
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:18,154
I'm good enough for you, but I'm not good
enough to associate with your daughter.

684
00:51:18,259 --> 00:51:19,851
- That's it, isn't it?
- Benjamin.

685
00:51:19,961 --> 00:51:21,428
Isn't it?

686
00:51:34,075 --> 00:51:35,372
Yes.

687
00:51:36,277 --> 00:51:39,269
You go to hell.
You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson.

688
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:40,970
Do you think I'm proud of myself?

689
00:51:41,082 --> 00:51:42,640
- Do you think I'm proud of this?
- I wouldn't know.

690
00:51:42,717 --> 00:51:44,241
Well, I am not.

691
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:45,918
No, sir.

692
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:49,485
I'm not proud that I spend my time
with a broken-down alcoholic.

693
00:51:50,291 --> 00:51:51,588
I see.

694
00:51:51,693 --> 00:51:55,390
If you think I come here for any reason
besides pure boredom than you're all wrong.

695
00:51:55,630 --> 00:51:57,257
'Cause, Mrs. Robinson,

696
00:51:57,498 --> 00:52:00,092
this is the sickest, most perverted thing
that ever happened to me.

697
00:52:00,301 --> 00:52:02,792
You do what you want,
but I'm getting the hell out.

698
00:52:03,404 --> 00:52:04,666
Are you?

699
00:52:04,739 --> 00:52:05,933
Goddamn right, I am.

700
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:12,441
That's how you feel about me?
That I'm a sick and disgusting person?

701
00:52:12,547 --> 00:52:14,845
- Now, don't start this.
- What?

702
00:52:15,116 --> 00:52:16,947
Don't start acting hurt.

703
00:52:17,118 --> 00:52:19,143
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?

704
00:52:19,253 --> 00:52:22,916
Mrs. Robinson, you lie there and tell me
I'm not good enough for your daughter.

705
00:52:22,957 --> 00:52:24,515
Did I say that?

706
00:52:24,826 --> 00:52:26,418
In so many words.

707
00:52:27,228 --> 00:52:31,824
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you
if that's the impression you got.

708
00:52:31,933 --> 00:52:34,868
Well, 2 minutes ago you told me I
wasn't good enough for your daughter.

709
00:52:34,936 --> 00:52:37,370
Now you say you're sorry
I got that impression.

710
00:52:37,438 --> 00:52:39,099
I didn't mean it.

711
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,435
I don't think you'd be
right for each other.

712
00:52:42,143 --> 00:52:45,169
I'd never say you aren't
as good a person as she is.

713
00:52:46,047 --> 00:52:47,605
You wouldn't?

714
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:50,513
Of course I wouldn't.

715
00:52:54,989 --> 00:52:56,479
What are you doing?

716
00:52:56,591 --> 00:53:00,118
Well, it's pretty obvious you don't
want me around anymore.

717
00:53:02,263 --> 00:53:04,094
Well, look, uh...

718
00:53:06,768 --> 00:53:08,702
I was kind of upset there.

719
00:53:10,204 --> 00:53:12,104
I'm sorry I said those things.

720
00:53:12,674 --> 00:53:14,107
It's all right.

721
00:53:14,275 --> 00:53:17,108
I think I can understand
why I'm disgusting to you.

722
00:53:18,012 --> 00:53:19,377
Oh, no.

723
00:53:21,082 --> 00:53:24,813
Look, I like you. I wouldn't keep
coming here if I didn't like you.

724
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,511
But if it's sickening for you?

725
00:53:27,689 --> 00:53:29,020
It's not.

726
00:53:32,193 --> 00:53:36,027
I enjoy it. I look forward to it. It's the
one thing I have to look forward to.

727
00:53:38,099 --> 00:53:39,964
You don't have to say that.

728
00:53:40,101 --> 00:53:41,728
Well, I wouldn't.

729
00:53:41,903 --> 00:53:44,167
I would never say it
if it wasn't true.

730
00:53:44,839 --> 00:53:46,397
May I stay, then?

731
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:51,205
Yes, please.
I want you to.

732
00:53:52,246 --> 00:53:54,043
- Thank you.
- Well, don't.

733
00:53:54,515 --> 00:53:57,040
Thank me, because I want you to.

734
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:00,947
But you won't ever take
Elaine out, will you?

735
00:54:01,022 --> 00:54:02,717
I want you to promise me that.

736
00:54:03,357 --> 00:54:05,348
Look, why the hell
did you bring this up?

737
00:54:05,426 --> 00:54:06,984
It never occurred
to me to take her out.

738
00:54:07,061 --> 00:54:08,653
Then give me your word you won't!

739
00:54:09,731 --> 00:54:11,426
This is absurd.

740
00:54:12,066 --> 00:54:13,727
Promise me, Benjamin.

741
00:54:14,736 --> 00:54:16,363
All right, I promise.

742
00:54:16,437 --> 00:54:19,634
For christ's sake, I promise
I'll never take out Elaine Robinson.

743
00:54:22,043 --> 00:54:23,533
Thank you.

744
00:54:28,583 --> 00:54:30,744
- Benjamin...
- Let's not talk about it.

745
00:54:32,353 --> 00:54:34,150
Let's not talk at all.

746
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:12,889
Elaine's back home soon.

747
00:55:13,294 --> 00:55:15,922
I think it might be a nice gesture
if you asked her out.

748
00:55:30,211 --> 00:55:32,406
I suppose she's not
good enough for you, is that it?

749
00:55:32,513 --> 00:55:34,947
Look, Elaine Robinson
and I do not get along.

750
00:55:35,016 --> 00:55:37,246
How do you know?
You haven't seen her since high school

751
00:55:37,451 --> 00:55:39,578
I suppose your evenings,

752
00:55:39,654 --> 00:55:42,384
whatever you do with them,
are just too valuable.

753
00:55:42,423 --> 00:55:44,288
That has nothing to do with it.

754
00:55:44,358 --> 00:55:46,383
I guess I'll just have
to tell Mr. Robinson...

755
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:50,226
that you're too busy every evening
doing God knows what.

756
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:52,095
Now don't go on like this.

757
00:55:52,834 --> 00:55:55,860
If Benjamin absolutely refuses
to take her out...

758
00:55:55,937 --> 00:55:56,961
I do.

759
00:55:57,038 --> 00:56:02,101
Then I will simply have to invite
all the Robinsons over on Thursday.

760
00:56:14,355 --> 00:56:17,347
Well, Braddock, it's about time
you got around to this.

761
00:56:18,392 --> 00:56:20,485
Your wife predicted you would say what?

762
00:56:28,369 --> 00:56:29,961
No points.
Right?

763
00:56:30,605 --> 00:56:32,368
Here's the next question.
Gentlemen...

764
00:56:32,473 --> 00:56:33,565
Hello.

765
00:56:33,708 --> 00:56:35,801
What is your wife's
most unusual habit?

766
00:56:35,977 --> 00:56:37,376
Ben, come on in.

767
00:56:37,411 --> 00:56:41,142
I'm afraid the young lady
isn't quite ready yet.

768
00:56:41,782 --> 00:56:44,012
What would you say
to a short one?

769
00:56:44,185 --> 00:56:46,710
- Scotch still your drink?
- Bourbon.

770
00:56:47,288 --> 00:56:49,085
Can you think of
something that bothers you?

771
00:56:51,993 --> 00:56:53,688
Not shaving her legs.

772
00:57:02,803 --> 00:57:04,930
Well, I'll see if she's ready.

773
00:57:16,017 --> 00:57:19,111
Listen, this was not my idea.
This was my father's idea.

774
00:57:19,253 --> 00:57:22,347
Benjamin, I thought I made myself
perfectly clear about this.

775
00:57:22,423 --> 00:57:25,551
Look, we'll go out to dinner and
have a drink, and I'll bring her right back.

776
00:57:25,626 --> 00:57:28,618
Because it was either that or
a dinner party for the 2 families.

777
00:57:28,729 --> 00:57:31,562
And I'm afraid I couldn't
quite handle that, if you don't mind.

778
00:57:33,167 --> 00:57:36,762
Look, I have no intention of ever
taking your precious daughter out again,

779
00:57:36,837 --> 00:57:39,169
- so don't get upset about it.
- I am.

780
00:57:39,774 --> 00:57:42,675
I'm extremely upset
about it, Benjamin.

781
00:57:44,379 --> 00:57:45,676
Hello.

782
00:57:46,148 --> 00:57:47,547
Hello.

783
00:57:47,683 --> 00:57:50,083
I want you to keep your wits
about you tonight.

784
00:57:50,485 --> 00:57:53,977
You never know what tricks Ben
picked up back there in the east.

785
00:58:05,467 --> 00:58:07,492
You're living at home now,
is that right?

786
00:58:07,602 --> 00:58:08,864
Yes.

787
00:58:09,871 --> 00:58:11,862
Do you know what
you're going to do?

788
00:58:11,907 --> 00:58:13,238
No.

789
00:58:16,378 --> 00:58:18,437
Are you going
to graduate school

790
00:58:18,981 --> 00:58:20,107
No.

791
00:58:25,988 --> 00:58:28,115
Do you always drive like this?

792
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:29,349
Yes.

793
00:59:53,575 --> 00:59:54,872
Sit down.

794
01:00:10,092 --> 01:00:12,026
Why don't you watch the show?

795
01:00:16,198 --> 01:00:18,723
Benjamin, do you dislike
me for some reason?

796
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,059
No. Why should I

797
01:00:21,937 --> 01:00:23,768
I don't know.

798
01:00:32,414 --> 01:00:34,712
You're missing a great effect here.

799
01:00:37,752 --> 01:00:39,481
How do you like that?

800
01:00:42,624 --> 01:00:44,353
Could you do it?

801
01:00:47,629 --> 01:00:49,460
Go, baby, go!

802
01:01:07,482 --> 01:01:08,949
- Stop!
- Hey!

803
01:01:18,293 --> 01:01:19,760
Elaine, I'm sorry.

804
01:01:20,562 --> 01:01:22,052
Elaine.

805
01:01:23,565 --> 01:01:25,328
Would you take me home now?

806
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,628
I'm sorry I took you in there.

807
01:01:26,701 --> 01:01:28,464
I think I better go home, please.

808
01:01:33,909 --> 01:01:35,274
Elaine.

809
01:01:35,310 --> 01:01:36,777
Where's the car?

810
01:01:36,811 --> 01:01:38,472
I just want to tell you something.

811
01:01:42,384 --> 01:01:43,851
I want to go home.

812
01:01:43,885 --> 01:01:45,876
But, I just tell you this one thing?

813
01:01:46,888 --> 01:01:47,980
What?

814
01:01:48,089 --> 01:01:50,683
This whole idea... this date and
everything, it was my parents' idea.

815
01:01:50,792 --> 01:01:52,225
They forced me into it.

816
01:01:52,394 --> 01:01:54,760
That's very nice of you to tell me.

817
01:01:55,197 --> 01:01:57,324
No, what I mean is, that's
why I've been acting this way.

818
01:01:57,432 --> 01:01:59,798
I'm not like this.
I hate myself like this.

819
01:02:04,105 --> 01:02:06,335
Listen, could you
just stop crying, please?

820
01:02:06,441 --> 01:02:08,033
No, I couldn't.

821
01:02:08,109 --> 01:02:09,872
- Well, could you try?
- No.

822
01:02:24,326 --> 01:02:26,794
I've had his feeling
ever since I've graduated...

823
01:02:27,028 --> 01:02:29,622
This kind of compulsion that
I have to be rude all the time,

824
01:02:29,731 --> 01:02:31,028
You know what I mean?

825
01:02:33,635 --> 01:02:35,159
Yes, I do.

826
01:02:35,637 --> 01:02:38,037
It's like I was playing
some kind of game,

827
01:02:38,073 --> 01:02:40,098
but the rules don't
make any sense to me.

828
01:02:40,442 --> 01:02:42,637
They're being made up
by all the wrong people.

829
01:02:42,877 --> 01:02:44,139
No.

830
01:02:44,546 --> 01:02:47,709
I mean, no one makes them up.
They seem to make themselves up.

831
01:02:49,684 --> 01:02:50,946
Say!

832
01:02:51,052 --> 01:02:53,748
Could I request that
you turn that down?

833
01:03:45,106 --> 01:03:46,698
Would you like to come in?

834
01:03:47,709 --> 01:03:49,301
I could make you some coffee.

835
01:03:50,845 --> 01:03:52,813
No. I wouldn't want
to wake anyone up.

836
01:03:53,715 --> 01:03:55,114
We won't.

837
01:03:55,317 --> 01:03:56,807
Let's go inside.

838
01:03:57,218 --> 01:03:58,617
Wait a minute.

839
01:03:58,653 --> 01:04:00,211
Is anything wrong?

840
01:04:02,023 --> 01:04:03,456
No. I was just thinking.

841
01:04:04,125 --> 01:04:05,649
It's still early.

842
01:04:06,027 --> 01:04:08,222
Maybe we could do something,
go somewhere else.

843
01:04:10,131 --> 01:04:11,496
All right.

844
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:20,264
Where are we going?

845
01:04:20,642 --> 01:04:23,406
I'm trying to think of... where there's
a place to have a drink around here.

846
01:04:23,478 --> 01:04:25,571
Isn't there one at the Taft Hotel

847
01:04:27,048 --> 01:04:28,982
What is the matter?

848
01:04:29,050 --> 01:04:32,110
Nothing. I'm just wondering
if they have a bar or not.

849
01:04:32,287 --> 01:04:34,016
I mean, let's go see.

850
01:04:34,089 --> 01:04:35,613
Let's go see if they do or not.

851
01:04:37,692 --> 01:04:40,183
Listen, Elaine, it seems to me
that there isn't a bar here.

852
01:04:40,261 --> 01:04:41,421
I mean, as far as I know.

853
01:04:41,496 --> 01:04:43,726
Of course there is.
Look, there's the palm room right there.

854
01:04:44,065 --> 01:04:45,157
Good evening.

855
01:04:45,467 --> 01:04:47,025
- Hello.
- How are you, sir?

856
01:04:47,268 --> 01:04:49,065
Good evening, Mr. Gladstone.

857
01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:50,933
Hello again.

858
01:04:52,307 --> 01:04:55,276
Hi, Mr. Gladstone.
How are you this evening?

859
01:04:56,411 --> 01:04:58,003
Benjamin?

860
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:00,739
Let's get out of here, Elaine.
Let's go somewhere else.

861
01:05:00,815 --> 01:05:02,680
- Do they know you?
- Of course not.

862
01:05:02,717 --> 01:05:05,584
- Good evening, sir.
- Come on, Elaine, we're leaving.

863
01:05:07,288 --> 01:05:09,449
Mr. Gladstone, how are you?

864
01:05:09,791 --> 01:05:11,693
- Benjamin, what's happening?
- I don't know.

865
01:05:11,693 --> 01:05:13,820
They must think I look
like this guy Gladstone.

866
01:05:13,895 --> 01:05:15,624
Hello, Mr. Braniff.

867
01:05:28,309 --> 01:05:31,745
Elaine, I like you.
I like you so much.

868
01:05:32,914 --> 01:05:34,745
Do you believe that?

869
01:05:38,253 --> 01:05:40,619
- Do you?
- Yes.

870
01:05:42,056 --> 01:05:43,887
You're the first...

871
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:48,720
You're the first thing for
so long that I've liked,

872
01:05:49,531 --> 01:05:51,761
the first person
I could stand to be with.

873
01:05:54,436 --> 01:05:57,337
My whole life is such a waste.

874
01:05:58,373 --> 01:06:00,000
It's just nothing.

875
01:06:04,746 --> 01:06:07,374
I'm sorry.
I'll take you home now.

876
01:06:11,052 --> 01:06:13,452
Benjamin, are you having
an affair with someone?

877
01:06:19,794 --> 01:06:21,284
I'm sorry.

878
01:06:21,596 --> 01:06:23,621
I'm sorry.
That's not my business.

879
01:06:24,466 --> 01:06:26,229
It just happened.

880
01:06:28,369 --> 01:06:31,998
It's just this thing that happened
along with everything else.

881
01:06:33,174 --> 01:06:35,039
Can you understand that?

882
01:06:36,578 --> 01:06:38,409
Was she married or something?

883
01:06:39,981 --> 01:06:41,539
Yes.

884
01:06:42,183 --> 01:06:43,844
With a family?

885
01:06:44,085 --> 01:06:46,212
Yes. She had a husband and a son.

886
01:06:48,189 --> 01:06:50,783
- Did they ever find out?
- No.

887
01:06:54,295 --> 01:06:56,354
And it's all over now?

888
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,358
Yes.

889
01:07:06,808 --> 01:07:08,537
I'm glad.

890
01:07:19,053 --> 01:07:20,884
Can we do something tomorrow?

891
01:07:21,523 --> 01:07:22,820
All right.

892
01:07:23,424 --> 01:07:25,824
During the day we'll go for
a drive or something.

893
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:27,157
Ok.

894
01:07:27,829 --> 01:07:29,956
- You sure you really want to?
- Yes.

895
01:07:30,632 --> 01:07:32,930
Because I wouldn't want you to do it
unless you really wanted to.

896
01:07:33,067 --> 01:07:34,398
I do.

897
01:07:34,469 --> 01:07:35,936
You do?

898
01:07:36,037 --> 01:07:38,471
- Benjamin, I really do.
- Shh!

899
01:08:09,370 --> 01:08:10,564
Drive down the block.

900
01:08:11,005 --> 01:08:12,472
Mrs. Robinson,

901
01:08:12,974 --> 01:08:15,238
Elaine and I have a date.
We're going for a drive.

902
01:08:15,310 --> 01:08:17,471
Do exactly as I say.

903
01:08:24,485 --> 01:08:27,386
- Now it seems to me...
- Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin.

904
01:08:27,789 --> 01:08:29,950
You are not to see
Elaine again ever.

905
01:08:30,024 --> 01:08:31,582
Those are my orders.
Is that clear?

906
01:08:31,626 --> 01:08:32,888
Mrs. Robinson, do you think...

907
01:08:32,994 --> 01:08:34,985
I can make things quite unpleasant.

908
01:08:35,029 --> 01:08:36,394
How?

909
01:08:36,731 --> 01:08:40,758
In order to keep Elaine away from
you, I'm prepared to tell her everything.

910
01:08:43,705 --> 01:08:45,297
I don't believe you.

911
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:48,008
Then you'd better
start believing me.

912
01:08:48,309 --> 01:08:50,072
I just don't believe
you would do that.

913
01:08:51,245 --> 01:08:52,712
Try me.

914
01:08:57,619 --> 01:08:59,917
God damn it.

915
01:09:09,864 --> 01:09:12,196
Elaine! Elaine!

916
01:09:12,267 --> 01:09:13,859
- Benjamin.
- I'm coming up!

917
01:09:13,936 --> 01:09:15,665
I'm not dressed yet.

918
01:09:15,938 --> 01:09:18,270
Benjamin, I said I wasn't dressed.

919
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:20,035
You've got to go over the back fence,
and I'll meet you on the corner.

920
01:09:20,175 --> 01:09:22,643
- What's the matter?
- Hurry. Put your shoes on.

921
01:09:24,279 --> 01:09:25,940
Benjamin.

922
01:09:26,081 --> 01:09:28,242
- Benjamin, what are you doing?
- Elaine...

923
01:09:28,350 --> 01:09:31,046
- Elaine, I have to tell you something.
- What is it?

924
01:09:31,086 --> 01:09:32,314
- That woman...
- Woman?

925
01:09:32,354 --> 01:09:34,219
The woman that older woman
that I told you about...

926
01:09:34,256 --> 01:09:36,019
- You mean that one?
- Yes. The married woman.

927
01:09:36,358 --> 01:09:38,724
- That wasn't just some woman.
- What are you telling me?

928
01:09:39,561 --> 01:09:41,688
Benjamin, would you just
tell me what this is about?

929
01:09:56,712 --> 01:09:58,612
- Oh, no.
- Elaine.

930
01:09:59,014 --> 01:10:01,778
- Oh, my God.
- Please.

931
01:10:02,084 --> 01:10:04,109
- Get out of here.
- Don't cry.

932
01:10:04,486 --> 01:10:06,886
Get out! Get out!

933
01:10:07,022 --> 01:10:08,751
Out! Get out!

934
01:10:13,896 --> 01:10:15,454
Good-bye, Benjamin.

935
01:12:12,548 --> 01:12:14,413
Say that again?

936
01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:16,815
I'm going to marry
Elaine Robinson.

937
01:12:22,658 --> 01:12:26,617
- Well, well, well!
- What's happening?

938
01:12:26,829 --> 01:12:30,321
Ben says that he and Elaine
are getting married.

939
01:12:31,633 --> 01:12:33,931
I don't believe it.

940
01:12:34,069 --> 01:12:36,765
- That's what he says, Right?
- I'm going up to Berkeley today.

941
01:12:37,072 --> 01:12:40,940
Oh, Ben, It's so exciting!

942
01:12:41,944 --> 01:12:43,809
Come on.
We've got to call the Robinsons.

943
01:12:43,879 --> 01:12:45,506
We've got something to celebrate.

944
01:12:45,581 --> 01:12:47,310
No. I think you'll
want to wait on that.

945
01:12:47,382 --> 01:12:49,441
- Oh, they don't know?
- No, they don't.

946
01:12:50,085 --> 01:12:52,679
- When did you decide all this?
- About an hour ago.

947
01:12:52,988 --> 01:12:55,821
Wait a minute.
You talked to Elaine this morning?

948
01:12:56,091 --> 01:12:57,683
No. She doesn't know about it.

949
01:12:58,460 --> 01:13:00,928
You mean she doesn't know
that you're coming up to Berkeley?

950
01:13:01,363 --> 01:13:04,059
No. Actually, she doesn't know
about us getting married yet.

951
01:13:04,967 --> 01:13:06,662
Well, when did you two talk this over?

952
01:13:06,802 --> 01:13:08,963
- We haven't.
- You haven't?

953
01:13:10,072 --> 01:13:13,701
Ben, this whole idea
sounds pretty half -baked.

954
01:13:13,775 --> 01:13:15,640
No, it's not.
It's completely baked.

955
01:13:15,978 --> 01:13:17,468
It's a decision I've made.

956
01:13:18,013 --> 01:13:19,981
Well, what makes you think
she wants to marry you?

957
01:13:20,082 --> 01:13:23,108
She doesn't. To be perfectly honest,
she doesn't like me.

958
01:16:36,478 --> 01:16:38,708
- You a student? What's that?
- Not exactly.

959
01:16:39,181 --> 01:16:40,910
I said not exactly, no.

960
01:16:42,117 --> 01:16:43,379
What are you then?

961
01:16:44,186 --> 01:16:45,949
I'm just sort of traveling through.

962
01:16:47,789 --> 01:16:49,723
I like to know
who's living in my house.

963
01:16:50,392 --> 01:16:52,690
I like to know
what my boys are up to.

964
01:16:53,595 --> 01:16:55,290
I'm not up to much actually.

965
01:16:57,232 --> 01:16:58,699
I'm just visiting.

966
01:17:01,036 --> 01:17:03,596
I mean, I've always
wanted to see Berkeley.

967
01:17:07,008 --> 01:17:08,839
- You're not one of those agitators?
- What?

968
01:17:08,944 --> 01:17:10,411
- One of those outside agitators?
- Oh, no.

969
01:17:10,512 --> 01:17:11,979
I hate that.
I won't stand for it.

970
01:17:12,914 --> 01:17:14,313
I won't stand for that.

971
01:18:44,606 --> 01:18:46,130
Pardon me.

972
01:18:51,146 --> 01:18:53,876
Well, how about this
for a coincidence?

973
01:18:59,521 --> 01:19:01,682
I was wondering where
you were headed.

974
01:19:02,157 --> 01:19:03,715
I'm meeting someone.

975
01:19:04,559 --> 01:19:05,992
Where?

976
01:19:08,630 --> 01:19:10,530
Where are you meeting this person?

977
01:19:10,632 --> 01:19:12,122
At the zoo.

978
01:19:12,334 --> 01:19:13,858
The zoo.

979
01:19:14,135 --> 01:19:16,296
They have a pretty good one
here, do they?

980
01:19:17,272 --> 01:19:19,240
I don't know.
I've never seen it.

981
01:19:19,641 --> 01:19:21,700
Well, I haven't, either.

982
01:19:23,945 --> 01:19:26,209
I might just ride
out there with you.

983
01:19:30,652 --> 01:19:32,711
- Is that him over there?
- No.

984
01:19:36,558 --> 01:19:38,321
Where did he say
he was going to meet you?

985
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:40,385
I thought he said
by the monkey house.

986
01:19:41,763 --> 01:19:44,288
Benjamin, I would like to know
what you're doing here.

987
01:19:44,366 --> 01:19:46,425
- Here? In Berkeley?
- Yes.

988
01:19:46,668 --> 01:19:50,399
Well, I have this very pleasant room,
and I've been getting into some classes.

989
01:19:50,472 --> 01:19:52,702
- But you're not enrolled.
- No, I just sit in.

990
01:19:52,774 --> 01:19:55,675
They don't seem to mind.
They've been very congenial about it.

991
01:19:56,111 --> 01:19:59,239
Benjamin, you're...
I don't know what to say.

992
01:19:59,314 --> 01:20:01,839
Maybe we can get together
sometime and talk about it.

993
01:20:02,017 --> 01:20:03,678
Really incredible.

994
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:07,651
- Here he comes.
- What?

995
01:20:07,989 --> 01:20:10,219
I got a real feeling
that this is the fella.

996
01:20:12,027 --> 01:20:13,324
Elaine!

997
01:20:13,495 --> 01:20:15,156
He certainly is a good walker.

998
01:20:15,630 --> 01:20:17,461
Am I late? I'm sorry.

999
01:20:17,532 --> 01:20:19,625
We thought you said
by the monkey house.

1000
01:20:20,101 --> 01:20:22,501
This is Benjamin Braddock.
Carl Smith.

1001
01:20:22,637 --> 01:20:24,867
Benjamin rode here
with me on the bus.

1002
01:20:25,006 --> 01:20:27,406
- Glad to meet you, Ben.
- Great meeting you, Carl

1003
01:20:27,542 --> 01:20:29,305
Swell seeing you.

1004
01:21:12,855 --> 01:21:14,379
Who is it?

1005
01:21:14,957 --> 01:21:16,982
I want to ask you a question,
and then I'm going.

1006
01:21:17,059 --> 01:21:18,754
- Come in.
- No.

1007
01:21:18,861 --> 01:21:20,419
I want to know
why you're here in Berkeley.

1008
01:21:20,563 --> 01:21:22,292
Because... I am.

1009
01:21:22,365 --> 01:21:24,060
Is it because I'm here?

1010
01:21:24,166 --> 01:21:26,396
- What do you think?
- I think it is.

1011
01:21:27,670 --> 01:21:29,865
- I said I think it is.
- All right, then. Yes.

1012
01:21:29,972 --> 01:21:32,702
- Well, I want you to leave.
- Well, look, I love you.

1013
01:21:32,808 --> 01:21:35,572
How could you do that, Benjamin?
Do you just hate Everything?

1014
01:21:35,778 --> 01:21:37,678
How could you possibly
rape my mother?

1015
01:21:37,713 --> 01:21:39,078
- What?
- I don't understand...

1016
01:21:39,115 --> 01:21:41,174
- Did you say Rape her?
- I don't understand how anyone...

1017
01:21:41,283 --> 01:21:43,012
What did she say?
Tell me what she said.

1018
01:21:43,085 --> 01:21:44,950
- Why?
- Because it isn't true.

1019
01:21:45,388 --> 01:21:46,753
Tell me.

1020
01:21:46,889 --> 01:21:49,323
She said that she was having
a drink at the hotel with a friend,

1021
01:21:49,392 --> 01:21:52,623
and that you waited for her in
the parking lot and told her that...

1022
01:21:52,795 --> 01:21:56,253
she was too drunk to drive home and that
you would get her a room for the night.

1023
01:21:56,399 --> 01:21:57,696
Oh, then what?

1024
01:21:57,900 --> 01:21:59,561
Then you took her upstairs,
and you raped her.

1025
01:21:59,702 --> 01:22:01,727
Oh, no, no.
That's not what happened.

1026
01:22:02,104 --> 01:22:04,834
What happened was there was
this party at my parents'.

1027
01:22:05,007 --> 01:22:07,441
- I drove your mother home...
- I don't want to hear this!

1028
01:22:07,510 --> 01:22:09,774
- We went upstairs to see your portrait...
- No! I don't!

1029
01:22:09,845 --> 01:22:12,006
- She started taking her clothes off,
- This is my mother, Benjamin!

1030
01:22:12,114 --> 01:22:15,515
And suddenly, there she was without
any clothes on... I mean, really naked.

1031
01:22:15,618 --> 01:22:17,950
Oh, shut... aah!

1032
01:22:31,634 --> 01:22:33,898
- Oh, hello, Mr. Mccleery.
- Who screamed?

1033
01:22:33,969 --> 01:22:35,436
It's all right, Mr. Mccleery.

1034
01:22:35,538 --> 01:22:38,063
Screaming is not all right,
not in my house, It isn't.

1035
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:40,640
It was just a visitor,
but it's all right now.

1036
01:22:42,745 --> 01:22:44,110
What did you do to her?

1037
01:22:44,346 --> 01:22:47,440
Look, she's all right. She's upset,
and she screamed, but it's ok now.

1038
01:22:47,550 --> 01:22:49,040
- Shall I get the cops?
- What?

1039
01:22:49,151 --> 01:22:50,880
- I'll get the cops.
- Hey, wait a minute.

1040
01:22:51,287 --> 01:22:52,515
Now, damn it, look.

1041
01:22:53,389 --> 01:22:55,050
Here she is, having some water.

1042
01:22:56,459 --> 01:22:58,450
There's no need
for the cops or anything.

1043
01:22:58,661 --> 01:23:01,459
All right, boys, you can all go back
to your rooms now.

1044
01:23:01,964 --> 01:23:03,192
Go ahead.

1045
01:23:03,766 --> 01:23:05,859
We won't have any more
of this agitation.

1046
01:23:07,770 --> 01:23:09,704
- Will we, Braddock?
- No, sir.

1047
01:23:12,908 --> 01:23:14,466
I want you out of here.

1048
01:23:15,177 --> 01:23:17,270
- What do you mean?
- You heard me out of here.

1049
01:23:17,379 --> 01:23:19,609
- What for?
- Because I don't like you.

1050
01:23:52,615 --> 01:23:54,276
I'm sorry I screamed.

1051
01:23:58,721 --> 01:24:01,019
Benjamin, when you came up here,

1052
01:24:01,123 --> 01:24:03,250
what did you think was
going to happen between us?

1053
01:24:05,227 --> 01:24:07,695
Elaine, right now I don't feel
like talking much.

1054
01:24:07,763 --> 01:24:10,891
I'm sorry about everything,
but I think I'll just do this now.

1055
01:24:22,778 --> 01:24:24,905
Can I just sit here
while you're packing?

1056
01:24:40,396 --> 01:24:42,023
What are you going to do now?

1057
01:24:43,265 --> 01:24:44,755
I don't know.

1058
01:24:45,467 --> 01:24:47,799
- Are you going home?
- No.

1059
01:24:48,003 --> 01:24:49,834
Well, where are you going?

1060
01:24:53,809 --> 01:24:55,970
Elaine, you're going to have
to stop asking me that.

1061
01:25:09,191 --> 01:25:11,022
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.

1062
01:25:14,129 --> 01:25:15,687
I don't understand.

1063
01:25:16,098 --> 01:25:17,759
I don't want you to go anywhere...

1064
01:25:21,003 --> 01:25:22,766
Until you have a definite plan.

1065
01:25:23,539 --> 01:25:25,234
Good-bye.

1066
01:26:00,976 --> 01:26:02,568
What's happening?

1067
01:26:02,778 --> 01:26:04,473
- Benjamin?
- What?

1068
01:26:10,452 --> 01:26:11,942
Will you kiss me?

1069
01:26:39,682 --> 01:26:41,274
Will you marry me?

1070
01:26:44,787 --> 01:26:47,278
- You won't?
- I don't know.

1071
01:26:50,292 --> 01:26:51,953
But you might?

1072
01:26:53,095 --> 01:26:54,619
I might.

1073
01:26:54,930 --> 01:26:56,488
Is that so?

1074
01:26:57,099 --> 01:26:59,533
- You might marry me?
- Yes.

1075
01:27:00,703 --> 01:27:02,193
When?

1076
01:27:03,338 --> 01:27:04,965
I don't know.

1077
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:07,640
How about tomorrow?
I don't mean to be pushy.

1078
01:27:07,743 --> 01:27:09,472
I don't know.

1079
01:27:10,546 --> 01:27:12,605
I don't know what's happening.

1080
01:27:14,616 --> 01:27:16,311
You mean you're confused?

1081
01:27:19,021 --> 01:27:20,682
Look, don't be confused.

1082
01:27:21,523 --> 01:27:23,047
We're getting married.

1083
01:27:24,827 --> 01:27:26,351
I don't see how we can.

1084
01:27:29,932 --> 01:27:31,524
We just can.

1085
01:27:39,041 --> 01:27:40,531
I have to go now.

1086
01:27:41,944 --> 01:27:43,275
Hey, Elaine?

1087
01:27:44,980 --> 01:27:46,675
Are you serious about this?

1088
01:27:48,050 --> 01:27:49,449
I'll think about it.

1089
01:27:49,885 --> 01:27:51,944
- You really will?
- Yes.

1090
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:06,590
Good God.

1091
01:28:08,570 --> 01:28:10,765
We can go get
our blood tests tomorrow.

1092
01:28:10,806 --> 01:28:12,330
- Tomorrow?
- Or this afternoon.

1093
01:28:12,374 --> 01:28:13,568
It's a good day for it.

1094
01:28:13,609 --> 01:28:16,078
Benjamin, I haven't even
said I'll marry you yet.

1095
01:28:16,078 --> 01:28:17,477
We'll need our birth certificates.

1096
01:28:17,579 --> 01:28:20,377
I happen to have mine with me.
Where's yours?

1097
01:28:20,783 --> 01:28:23,047
- I just don't think it would work.
- Why wouldn't it?

1098
01:28:35,097 --> 01:28:38,032
- Why wouldn't it?
- I just don't think it would.

1099
01:28:39,501 --> 01:28:42,664
Tomorrow, then. Can we get
our blood tests tomorrow morning?

1100
01:28:43,739 --> 01:28:46,902
Why don't you just drag me off
if you want to marry me so much?

1101
01:28:47,009 --> 01:28:48,909
Why don't I just drag you off?

1102
01:28:49,011 --> 01:28:52,174
All right. I will, right after
we get the blood tests.

1103
01:28:52,548 --> 01:28:54,413
I have to see Carl first.

1104
01:28:54,516 --> 01:28:56,245
Carl who?

1105
01:28:59,421 --> 01:29:01,218
Carl who?

1106
01:29:01,623 --> 01:29:04,786
Carl Smith. He's a medical student.
We've known him for years.

1107
01:29:04,927 --> 01:29:06,952
- Who, that guy at the zoo?
- Yes.

1108
01:29:07,029 --> 01:29:10,021
- Why do you have to see him?
- Well, I said I might marry him.

1109
01:29:11,967 --> 01:29:13,491
You what?!

1110
01:29:13,836 --> 01:29:15,497
How did he do it?

1111
01:29:15,637 --> 01:29:17,229
Did he get down on his knees?

1112
01:29:17,339 --> 01:29:19,239
He didn't get down
on his knees, I hope.

1113
01:29:19,274 --> 01:29:20,832
No, Benjamin.

1114
01:29:20,943 --> 01:29:23,036
What did he say?
I'm curious.

1115
01:29:23,145 --> 01:29:24,544
Shh.

1116
01:29:24,646 --> 01:29:27,945
He said he thought we'd
make a pretty good team.

1117
01:29:28,150 --> 01:29:31,244
- Oh, no. He said that?
- Shh!

1118
01:29:31,353 --> 01:29:32,911
Where did he do it?

1119
01:29:34,590 --> 01:29:36,785
I'd like to know where it happened.

1120
01:29:39,661 --> 01:29:41,686
It wasn't in his car, was it?

1121
01:29:55,077 --> 01:29:56,476
Good night.

1122
01:29:56,612 --> 01:29:58,978
Are we getting married tomorrow?

1123
01:29:59,615 --> 01:30:00,980
No.

1124
01:30:02,084 --> 01:30:03,642
The day after tomorrow?

1125
01:30:05,420 --> 01:30:08,753
I don't know. Maybe we are,
and maybe we're not.

1126
01:30:59,241 --> 01:31:02,574
Do you want to, uh... do you want
to try and tell me why you did it?

1127
01:31:04,446 --> 01:31:05,845
Mr. Robinson.

1128
01:31:06,048 --> 01:31:07,879
Do you have a special
grudge against me?

1129
01:31:07,983 --> 01:31:10,281
Do you feel a particularly
strong resentment?

1130
01:31:10,352 --> 01:31:11,444
No.

1131
01:31:11,553 --> 01:31:13,680
Is there something I've said
that's caused this contempt,

1132
01:31:13,755 --> 01:31:16,519
or is it just things I stand for
that you despise?

1133
01:31:16,658 --> 01:31:18,285
It was nothing to do with you, sir.

1134
01:31:18,393 --> 01:31:21,385
Well, Ben, it was
quite a bit to do with me.

1135
01:31:21,463 --> 01:31:22,953
Now, look, please...

1136
01:31:23,065 --> 01:31:24,760
Ben, I think we're 2
civilized human beings.

1137
01:31:24,866 --> 01:31:26,697
Do you think it's necessary
to threaten each other?

1138
01:31:26,768 --> 01:31:28,258
I'm not threatening you.

1139
01:31:28,370 --> 01:31:31,066
Do you want to unclench
your fist, please? Thank you.

1140
01:31:31,273 --> 01:31:33,798
I can see in the dark, you know.
I've been here quite a while.

1141
01:31:34,109 --> 01:31:37,670
I'm trying to tell you I have no personal
feelings about you, Mr. Robinson.

1142
01:31:37,779 --> 01:31:39,713
I'm trying to tell you
I do not resent you.

1143
01:31:39,781 --> 01:31:42,306
You don't respect me
terribly much, either.

1144
01:31:43,218 --> 01:31:44,776
- No, sir.
- What?

1145
01:31:44,987 --> 01:31:47,581
- No, sir.
- Don't shout at me, Ben.

1146
01:31:47,689 --> 01:31:50,351
I may not be as young as you,
but I still have pretty good hearing.

1147
01:31:50,392 --> 01:31:53,725
- Mr. Robinson...
- Have the decency to wait until I finish.

1148
01:31:54,997 --> 01:31:57,557
I do think you should know the
consequences of what you've done.

1149
01:31:57,699 --> 01:32:01,100
I do think you should know that my wife
and I are getting a divorce soon.

1150
01:32:01,503 --> 01:32:02,970
But why?

1151
01:32:03,005 --> 01:32:04,438
Why?!

1152
01:32:04,539 --> 01:32:06,063
Listen to me.

1153
01:32:06,842 --> 01:32:09,868
What happened between
Mrs. Robinson and me was nothing.

1154
01:32:10,046 --> 01:32:11,638
It didn't mean anything.

1155
01:32:11,748 --> 01:32:15,240
We might just as well
have been shaking hands.

1156
01:32:15,418 --> 01:32:16,976
Shaking hands.

1157
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:19,384
That's not saying much
for my wife, is it?

1158
01:32:19,422 --> 01:32:21,652
- You miss the point.
- I guess I do.

1159
01:32:21,724 --> 01:32:24,557
The point is, I don't love your wife.
I love your daughter, sir.

1160
01:32:25,561 --> 01:32:27,529
All right. Now listen to this.

1161
01:32:27,730 --> 01:32:30,631
I don't know whether
I can prosecute, but I think I can.

1162
01:32:30,767 --> 01:32:34,533
I think I can get you behind bars
if you ever look at my daughter again.

1163
01:32:34,971 --> 01:32:37,940
I've seen Elaine, and I've made
damn sure you can't get to her.

1164
01:32:38,041 --> 01:32:39,508
Stay away from me, Ben!

1165
01:32:40,743 --> 01:32:42,506
I don't want to mince words with you.

1166
01:32:42,578 --> 01:32:46,844
As far as Elaine is concerned, you're to
get her out of your filthy mind right now.

1167
01:32:46,949 --> 01:32:49,383
Is that perfectly clear to you?

1168
01:32:49,552 --> 01:32:53,955
And that's all, Ben. You'll pardon me
if I don't shake hands with you.

1169
01:32:55,958 --> 01:32:57,983
I think you are filth.

1170
01:32:58,194 --> 01:33:00,492
I think you are scum!

1171
01:33:02,165 --> 01:33:03,860
You are a degenerate!

1172
01:33:09,872 --> 01:33:11,134
Hi.

1173
01:33:13,476 --> 01:33:16,468
Mr. Mccleery, do you have some change?
I need to use the phone.

1174
01:33:16,779 --> 01:33:18,679
I want you out of here.

1175
01:33:18,881 --> 01:33:22,282
Look, I'll give you $10 for a dime.
I'll give you 20.

1176
01:33:23,086 --> 01:33:25,418
For God's sake, will you
let me use that phone?

1177
01:33:26,289 --> 01:33:28,519
I'm going to call the police... now.

1178
01:33:28,591 --> 01:33:30,582
Could I make one phone call first?

1179
01:33:30,793 --> 01:33:32,420
Get out of here!

1180
01:33:43,439 --> 01:33:45,839
Elaine Robinson has left school

1181
01:33:46,442 --> 01:33:49,275
Her roommate's coming down
with a note for you.

1182
01:33:52,815 --> 01:33:55,010
Dear Benjamin, please forgive me,

1183
01:33:55,351 --> 01:33:58,411
because I know what I'm doing
is the best thing for you.

1184
01:33:58,721 --> 01:34:01,281
My father is so upset.
You've got to understand.

1185
01:34:01,657 --> 01:34:03,522
I love you, but it
would never work out.

1186
01:35:28,010 --> 01:35:29,500
Elaine?

1187
01:35:31,647 --> 01:35:33,239
Hello, Benjamin.

1188
01:35:37,620 --> 01:35:38,848
Where is she?

1189
01:35:39,021 --> 01:35:41,216
- Hello. Get me the police, please.
- Where's Elaine?

1190
01:35:41,324 --> 01:35:42,848
I'll be with you
in a moment, Benjamin.

1191
01:35:42,959 --> 01:35:46,451
Do you have a patrol car
in the vicinity of 1200 Glenview Road?

1192
01:35:47,330 --> 01:35:48,854
Good. We have a burglar here.

1193
01:35:49,532 --> 01:35:51,762
Just a second. I'll ask him.
Are you armed?

1194
01:35:53,736 --> 01:35:55,397
No, I don't believe he is.

1195
01:35:55,538 --> 01:35:56,766
Thank you.

1196
01:35:57,173 --> 01:35:58,697
What have you done to her?

1197
01:35:58,841 --> 01:36:01,639
I think we have everything
quite under control now, Benjamin.

1198
01:36:01,677 --> 01:36:03,406
Would you like a quick drink
before you go?

1199
01:36:03,479 --> 01:36:06,209
You can't stop me from seeing her.
I'll find her.

1200
01:36:06,649 --> 01:36:09,413
Sorry we won't be able to
invite you to the wedding Benjamin,

1201
01:36:09,452 --> 01:36:11,386
but the arrangements
have been so rushed.

1202
01:36:12,588 --> 01:36:14,579
What the hell have you...

1203
01:36:19,562 --> 01:36:22,963
I don't think you'll have time
for that drink after all.

1204
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,764
- I'll find her.
- I don't think so.

1205
01:37:30,966 --> 01:37:32,558
Say, fellas.

1206
01:37:33,636 --> 01:37:36,264
Do any of you fellas
know where Carl Smith is?

1207
01:37:36,472 --> 01:37:38,963
He took off in the middle of
the night to get married.

1208
01:37:39,141 --> 01:37:41,302
Probably one step
ahead of the shotgun.

1209
01:37:42,244 --> 01:37:44,269
Would you happen to know
where he's getting married?

1210
01:37:44,380 --> 01:37:45,972
I'm supposed to be there.

1211
01:37:46,082 --> 01:37:47,572
Why don't you ask Carter?

1212
01:37:48,351 --> 01:37:50,285
Would you happen to know
where I might find him?

1213
01:37:50,386 --> 01:37:52,013
Hey, Carter!

1214
01:37:52,988 --> 01:37:55,081
Where's the make-out king
getting married?

1215
01:37:55,191 --> 01:37:57,216
Santa Barbara!

1216
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:58,759
You don't happen to know exactly...

1217
01:37:58,861 --> 01:38:01,125
where the old make-out king
is getting married, do you?

1218
01:38:01,263 --> 01:38:02,787
I'm supposed to be there.

1219
01:38:02,898 --> 01:38:04,957
Where in Santa Barbara?

1220
01:38:05,768 --> 01:38:10,228
I don't know. Maybe his old man's house,
or in the maternity ward.

1221
01:38:11,407 --> 01:38:13,534
- Hey, you going to the wedding?
- Yeah.

1222
01:38:13,609 --> 01:38:15,975
Hey, tell him to save
a piece for me.

1223
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:19,072
Of the wedding cake!

1224
01:39:05,027 --> 01:39:07,621
- Can I use your phone?
- Yeah.

1225
01:39:34,890 --> 01:39:36,414
Hello, who is this?

1226
01:39:36,492 --> 01:39:38,221
This is Dr. Smith's
answering service.

1227
01:39:38,294 --> 01:39:39,659
Is the doctor anywhere?

1228
01:39:39,762 --> 01:39:42,253
I'm afraid the doctor can't be reached
right now. If you'd like to leave...

1229
01:39:42,364 --> 01:39:43,922
I have to know where he is.

1230
01:39:44,066 --> 01:39:47,729
Well, the doctor is at his son's wedding,
but I'm sure it's over by now.

1231
01:39:47,970 --> 01:39:49,335
He should be checking in
at any moment.

1232
01:39:49,472 --> 01:39:51,804
Listen to me.
I'm Dr. Smith's brother,

1233
01:39:52,074 --> 01:39:54,975
reverend Smith, and I'm supposed
to perform the ceremony.

1234
01:39:55,077 --> 01:39:58,171
I just got in from Portland, and I've
forgotten what church, you see?

1235
01:39:58,314 --> 01:40:03,616
Well, I'm not sure, but you might try the
First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street.

1236
01:40:03,686 --> 01:40:05,415
Thank you.

1237
01:40:05,488 --> 01:40:07,649
Allan Street, where is it?

1238
01:40:08,090 --> 01:40:11,491
Uh, Allan, uh...
It's, uh... it's uh...

1239
01:40:11,794 --> 01:40:15,730
It's 6 blocks up and, uh, 3 over.

1240
01:40:16,432 --> 01:40:19,094
You need any gas, father?

1241
01:42:06,342 --> 01:42:09,641
Oh, Jesus God. No.

1242
01:42:20,556 --> 01:42:22,751
Elaine!

1243
01:42:23,025 --> 01:42:25,585
Elaine!

1244
01:42:25,861 --> 01:42:28,193
Elaine!

1245
01:42:28,564 --> 01:42:30,862
Elaine!

1246
01:42:31,333 --> 01:42:33,597
Who is that guy?
What's he doing?

1247
01:42:33,736 --> 01:42:35,897
- I'll take care of him.
- He's too late.

1248
01:42:37,272 --> 01:42:39,433
Elaine!

1249
01:42:39,775 --> 01:42:45,941
Elaine! Elaine!

1250
01:42:46,548 --> 01:42:48,675
We've got to stop him!

1251
01:42:49,385 --> 01:42:57,815
Elaine! Elaine!

1252
01:43:06,702 --> 01:43:09,170
Ben!

1253
01:43:13,609 --> 01:43:16,271
You punk. You crazy punk!

1254
01:43:16,679 --> 01:43:18,306
I'll kill you.

1255
01:43:32,227 --> 01:43:34,195
Elaine! It's too late!

1256
01:43:34,296 --> 01:43:35,786
Not for me!

1257
01:43:37,300 --> 01:43:41,464
- Move! Move!
- Damn you!
