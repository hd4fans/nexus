嘿 嘿 当心 当心

欢迎你 我的朋友!

5
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,770

- Great to see you! - Glad you made it

6
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,330
那是阿吉特吧
This can't be Ajit.

7
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,030
他都长这么大了 真不敢相信
He's a little man already. Unbelievable.

8
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,530
艾德里安 你饿了吧?

我做了你爱吃的咖喱鱼
I made that fish curry you love.

11
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,200
我都等不及了
I can't wait.

12
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,460
她可是越来越漂亮了
She gets more beautiful every time I see her.

13
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:07,250
怎么回事?
Why is that?

14
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,420
很奇怪是吧?
Strange, isn't it?

15
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,170
可她做饭的手艺一直没见长
But her fish curry is still awful.

16
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,000
你在电话里神神秘秘的
You were mysterious on the phone.

17
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,710
为什么不去参加研讨会?
Why didn't you attend the conference?

18

你一会儿就知道了 艾德里安阁下

19
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,640
萨特南 别再叫我 "阁下"

20
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,190
我们要下去多深?
How deep do we need to go?

21
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,060
3000多米
11000 feet.

22
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,820
我为此找遍了整个印度
Searched all over India for this dig.

23
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,150
这里曾是世界上最深的铜矿井
Used to be the deepest copper mine in the world.

24
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,490
还记得我弟弟格迪普吗? 他现在是一名学生

艾德里安 叫我艾德里安就好
Adrian. It's just Adrian.

27
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,120
冰块就这么点 这哪够用

28
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,250
省着点用 好吗?
Just don't pour too much, huh?

29
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,460
你们怎么能在这么热的地方工作?
How do you work in this heat?

30
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,970
今天算不错的了 我的朋友
You've come on a good day, my friend.

Sometimes it can be 120 degrees

32
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,470
你得见见洛克什博士

36
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,150
那么 你要给我看什么?
So, what are we looking at?

37
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,300
这些中微子行为正常
These neutrinos are acting normally.

38
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,400
没有聚集或是带电荷
No mass, no electrical charge.

39
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,490
他们可以不受干扰的穿过其它物质
They pass through ordinary matter almost undisturbed.

40
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,800
你曾告诉我 它们的数量 在上次太阳喷发后翻了一倍?
Your message said the count doubled after the last solar eruptions.

41
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,620
那是上周的事了
That was last week.

42
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,040
现在我要说的是两天前的事
But this happened two days ago.

43
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,340
人类历史上最大的一次太阳喷发
The biggest solar eruptions in human history.

44
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,700
产生的中微子数量 将是有记录以来最多的一回
Causing the highest neutrino count we've ever recorded.

45
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,300
我的天啊
My God.

46
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,600
我担心的并不是这个 艾德里安
That's not what worries me, Adrian.

47
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,980
史无前例的是
For the first time ever,

48
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,190
中微子正在引起物理反应
the neutrinos are causing a physical reaction.

49
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,150
那是不可能的
That's impossible.

50
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,160
真是太爽了!
That feels very good!

走吧 跟我来
Please, follow me.

52
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,210
你不会相信这个的
You won't believe this.

53
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,960
这很诡异

54
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:21,550
这个水槽还要再深1800米
This water tank goes down another 6000 feet.

55
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,550
看起来 这些来自太阳的中微子
It looks like the neutrinos coming from the sun,

56
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,600
已经突变成了一种新的核粒子
have mutated into a new kind of nuclear particle.

57
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,440
它们正在给地核加热
They're heating up the Earth's core.

58
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,570
然后突然变得就和微波一样

就一句 谢谢各位
Just a "thank you".

64
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,820
今晚多亏了大家的慷慨解囊

卢浮宫, 巴黎

146
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,200
2011年

147
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:53,570
我可是非常信任你们机构的

148
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,910
这真是完美的复制品 罗兰

149
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,980
现在到处都是狂热份子 很可能破坏她

150
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:06,820
想想那些在阿富汗被炸毁的佛像

151
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:10,230
我们的遗产机构已经开始

152
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:14,530
从大英博物馆和东宫博物馆迁移珍品

153
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:24,370
把她藏在瑞士的隧道里

154
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:29,960
我相信 她一定会很安全了

155
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,380
绝对安全 罗兰

156
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:38,050
只有通过红外分析才能看出差别

157
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,100
但这仍是赝品

158
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:58,360
一个纪录片小组发现了这次集体自杀
This mass suicide was actually discovered by a documentary crew here

159
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,670
这里是玛雅古城 达格尔
in the ancient Mayan city of Takal.

160
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,920
我们看到了许多死者
Now the victims, and we've seen many,

161
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,370
据说他们都相信"玛雅预言"
are said to have adhered to the Mayan-Quiche calender,

162
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:10,180
"玛雅预言"是说 由于太阳毁灭性的力量
which predicts the end of time to occur on the 21st December of this year,

163
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,710
今年的12月21日 将成为世界末日
due to the suns destructive forces.

164
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,590
谢谢 马克
Thank you, Mark.

165
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:16,760
神奇的是 科学研究也证明了这一观点
Strangely enough, scientific records do support the fact

166
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:20,420
曼哈顿海滩, 加利福尼亚州

167
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:21,420
我们正面临有史以来 最剧烈的太阳活动
that we are heading for the biggest solar climax in recorded history.

168
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:30,570
许多人相信"玛雅预言"
Many people believe that the Mayan Calender

169
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,770
当太阳系的全部行星排成一条直线...
predicts that there's supposed to be a galactic alignment...

170
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,820
我完蛋了 完蛋了 彻底完蛋了
I'm a dead man. I'm a dead man. I'm a dead man.

171
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:51,580
嘿 凯特 我已经上高速公路了
Hey, Kate, I'm practically on the freeway right now.

172
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,210
对 我正朝你那边去呢
Yes, I'm rolling towards you as we speak.

173
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,880
别急好不好? 我马上就到了
Would you relax? I'll be there any second.

174
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,930
我们是去玩 又不是去看医生
You know it's a vacation and not a doctors appointment, right?

175
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,600
一定会很好玩的
It's supposed to be fun.

176
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,180
你知道什么是好玩的 是不是?
You remember fun, don't you Kate?

177
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,140
还记得从什么时候开始 你觉得都不好玩了吗?
Do you remember where you were when it stopped being fun for you?

178
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,440
我知道了
Got it.

179
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,400
防蚊液?
Bug spray?

180
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:22,540
噢 对 这个季节黄石公园的蚊子很多
Oh yeah, cause it's mosquito season in Yellowstone.

181
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:26,620
我带了很多 先挂了 这里信号不好
I got a whole bunch. I gotta go, because I'm in a bad reception area.

182
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,920
哇哦! 老兄 看到了吗?
Woah, man. Would you look at that?

183
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,710
天啊!
Sick

184
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,060
梅里尔 我跟你说过
Merrill, I told you.

185
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,140
我们应该搬回威斯康星州
We have to move back to Wisconsin.

186
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:52,900
兰迪 这些小地震真的让我很害怕
These little mini-quakes are really getting on my nerves, Randy.

187
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,560
得了吧 只是地表的一些小裂缝而已 没什么可担心的
Come on, a little surface crack, you're not gonna be inconvenienced by that.

188
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,990
也对 找个整形医生来就可以了
Right, surface cracks, I've got a plastic surgeon for that

189
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:01,530
哈哈 多亏有防震咖啡杯
Thank God for those shake-proof coffee mugs.

190
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,490
充分展现了加州人的本性
They show the true nature of us Californians.

191
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:07,460
我们不会向这些小裂缝低头的
We'll not bow to these little inconvenient things like surface quakes.

192
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,000
忏悔吧
因为末日要
降临
引申自《圣经》

193
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:10,300
你有关于地震的趣事要分享吗?
Do you have a funny mini-quake story and want to share it?

194
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,970
- 嗨 爹地 - 嗨 宝贝
- Hi, daddy! - Hi, baby.

195
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,350
- 甜心 过得好不好? - 很好
- How are you sweety? - Good

196
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,510
- 杰克逊 这是怎么回事? - 别这么叫我
- Jackson, what is this? - Please don't call me that.

197
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,180
我是你爸爸
I'm your dad.

198
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,980
开豪华车带他们去露营?
Taking them camping in a limo?

199
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,900
好极了 很有派头 你的临时工作怎么样了?
Okay, great. What happened to your temp job?

200
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,650
比较闲 不过有更多的时间写作了
Better hours, more time to write.

201
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,360
睡眠呢 你最近还失眠吗?
What about sleeping, have you been doing that lately?

202
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,410
我说过无数次了
I've said it a thousand times.

203
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,200
周五不做抽脂手术 太恶心了
No lipo on Fridays. It's too messy.

204
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,370
等一下
Hold on.

205
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,040
- 早上好 杰克逊 - 嗨
- Morning Jackson. - Hi

206
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,630
- 这车不错 - 谢谢
- Nice ride. - Thanks.

207
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:55,210
旅途愉快 记住 小心大黑熊
Have a nice trip. Remember, watch out for the bears.

208
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,500
再见 戈登
Bye, Gordon.

209
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,260
- 爱你 亲爱的 - 再见
- Love you, Honey. - Bye

210
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,420
- 那么 什么事? - 你跟他说
- Okay, so, oh,yeah. - You tell him.

211
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,810
跟我说什么?
Tell me what?

212
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,720
每晚睡觉前帮她换上
She needs to put these on every night before she goes to sleep.

213
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,930
还要穿?
Still?

214
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,180
没错 你7岁大的女儿还会尿床
Yes. Your 7 year old daughter still wets her bed.

215
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,200
你从来不关心你的女儿
Maybe that's something you should know.

216
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,180
- 爱你 - 我也爱你 妈妈
- Love you. - Love you, Mom.

217
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,640
- 嘿! - 好了吗?
- Hey! - You okay?

218
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,770
他们早就想和你一起出去玩了
They really were looking forward to spending some time with you

219
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,410
我知道
I know.

220
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,490
所以 不要老泡在电脑上
So don't be on your computer all the time.

221
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,650
知道了
Got it.

222
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,410
我爱你们!
Love you!

223
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,460
- 这次我们要去日本 - 那又怎样?
- So this time we'll hit Japan. - So?

224
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,630
你就能去看看你的儿子威尔了
Now you can visit your boy, Will.

225
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,040
下午好 美女们!
Afternoon, ladies!

226
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,300
你好 帅哥
Hello!

227
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,370
你在听我说话吗?
Are you even listening to me?

228
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,340
听着呢 哈里
Unfortunately I am, Harry.

229
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,390
我听奥德利说 你当爷爷了
I heard from Audrey you're a grandpa now.

230
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,730
能不能不要管我的家务事?
Would you mind keeping your nose out of my family?

231
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,060
别破坏了我的心情 伙计 我们在这儿
You're cramping my style, baby. There we are.

232
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,560
爵士
之夜

233
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,560
哈里
与
托尼

234
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,560
晚上8点

235
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,440
只不过娶个日本媳妇 又不是世界末日
So he married a Japanese girl, how's that the end of the world?

236
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,650
好了 托尼 好歹去看他一次吧
Come on, Tony, you should at least go see him.

237
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,860
- 你去看过你儿子了吗? - 不是经常去
- You see your boy? - Not as much as I'd like.

238
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,320
华盛顿太远了 但起码我们聊电话
DC is a long way, but at least we talk

239
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,040
聊什么?
About what?

240
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,410
人生 人生苦短啊
Life. And how short it is.

241
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:36,230
见鬼 这是怎么回事?
What the hell was that?

242
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:45,120
- 喂? - 劳拉?
- Hello? - Laura?

243
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,860
劳拉 你听得见吗?

244
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,450
罗兰 是你吗?

245
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:51,080
劳拉 我们被骗了

246
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,450
明天我准备开一个记者招待会

247
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,790
我要告诉大家真相

248
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,760
你在说什么?

249
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,550
你拿走的那些艺术品根本不在瑞士

250
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,290
那些隧道都是空的

251
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,670
我有证据

252
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,280
劳拉 劳拉 你听得见吗?

253
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,200
罗兰 我听不到你说什么

254
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,100
劳拉 能听见吗?

255
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:22,650
∮轮回永不间断

256
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:27,860
∮永无止境

257
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:33,070
∮美好的的家园 就在前面

258
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,950
∮在那苍穹

259
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,950
黄石国家公园

260
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,590
- 我喜欢那首歌 - 收不到了
- I liked that song. - We lost it.

261
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:49,170
西海岸到处都是地表裂缝
The west coast with all those surface cracks,

262
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:53,930
我告诉自己 "查理 快他妈的去黄石公园"
I told myself, Charlie, get your stupid ass to Yellowstone.

263
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:57,720
我可不想错过大爆炸
I don't want to miss all the fun when it finally blows.

264
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,900
我爆个料 整个早上 政府的人就在黄石公园上空飞来飞去
Let me tell you, there's been government people flying in and out all morning,

265
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,690
相信我 他们个个都面色凝重
and trust me, they do not look happy.

266
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,280
- 听众们 一定要记住 - 真奇怪
- Always remember, folks. - It's weird.

267
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,610
- 是查理最先告诉你们的 - 你相信他说的?
- You heard it first from Charlie. - Can you believe he said that?

268
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,780
那你相信怪兽吗?
What are the odds?

269
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,330
我们并没有看到土壤像预期的那样液化
We're not seeing the soil liquefaction we'd expect

270
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,380
也没有迹象表明这是板块的裂缝延伸
or find any evidence of fracture propagation within the tectonic plates.

271
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,410
通俗点 博士
English, doctor.

272
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:23,810
西海岸的那些裂缝不是由板块...
The seismic activity on the west coast is not caused by tect...

273
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,100
不是由正常的地震引起的
by regular earth quakes.

274
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:28,340
地表的这些裂缝和地球的板块断层无关
And these surface cracks have nothing to do with shifting fault lines.

275
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:31,950
你是说 现在就要开始实施卓铭计划?
Are you suggesting this could be the beginning of the Joline operation?

276
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,060
赫尔姆斯利博士今天会飞到黄石公园搜集更多资料 总统先生
Dr. Helmsley is flying to Yellowstone this morning to collect more data, sir.

277
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:39,470
我们一直在按照你制定的时间表进行 赫尔姆斯利博士
We've been following the schedule you established, Mr Helmsley.

278
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:42,220
人类历史上最重要的时间表
The most important schedule in the history of mankind.

279
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,940
可你却告诉我 这个时间表作废了?
Now you're telling me we have to throw it out?

280
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:45,940
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

281
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,900
是我弄错了
I was wrong.

282
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:56,490
你知道有谁敢在这间办公室里这样说吗?
Do you know how many times I've heard those words in this office?

283
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,200
一个也没有
Zero.

284
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:01,920
你看报纸了么?
Did you see this?

285
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,330
对不起 总统先生 她执意要进来
I'm sorry Mr President. She insisted.

286
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,170
新闻上都在播这个
It's all over the news.

287
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:12,420
我们正在进一步调查这起汽车爆炸事件

288

法国国家博物馆馆长

Coincidentally, his death took place in the same Paris tunnel

291
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,560
也是在这条隧道中遇难
where Princess Diana died in 1997.

292
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,860
我们会继续追踪报道此事件
We are continuing to follow this story...

293
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,530
劳拉 你没有见过赫尔姆斯利博士吧
Laura, I don't believe you've met Dr. Helmsley.

294
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,160
我和他通过电话 爸爸 他跟我说...
I just talked to him Dad, and he told me...

295
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,070
我工作的机构是一个骗局
the organization I work for is a sham.

296
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,910
他为什么这么说?
Why would he say that?

297
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,840
你生起气来和你妈妈一模一样
You look just like your mother when you get upset.

298
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:50,710
- 我有和你说过吗? - 每次我生气你都这样说
- Did I ever tell you that? - Every time I get upset.

299
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,260
爸爸 有人被谋杀了
Daddy, a man was killed.

300
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:58,680
亲爱的 先坐下
Honey. Please sit down.

301
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,520
我将要告诉你的事 即使在白宫也只有十几个人知道
Only a dozen people in this administration know what I'm about to tell you.

302
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,110
爸爸 到底发生了什么事?
Dad, what's going on?

303
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,910
我们正在进行一次史无前例的 国际合作
An unprecedented international endeavor is under way.

304
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:28,540
目前已经有46个国家参与
At this point 46 nations are invested in this thing.

305
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,500
劳拉很聪明 她会明白的
Laura's a smart girl. She'll understand.

306
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,380
巴黎的那件事
That thing in Paris.

307
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,420
与我们无关 对吧?
We're not involved in any of that, are we?

308
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,400
"我们"? "我们"是什么鬼东西?
"We"? Who the hell is "we"?

309
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,930
你在说什么啊?
What are you talking about?

310
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,680
我们的当务之急是这个时间表
What we need to do is focus on this time line. That's we need to do.

311
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,230
那什么时候告诉大家真相?
So when do we let the country know?

312
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,270
- 什么意思? - 我们的百姓啊 长官
- What do you mean? - The people, sir.

313
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,310
他们有权知道
They need to know.

314
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,820
他们当然会知道 听好了
Well of course they do. Listen.

315
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:54,400
你的任务是弄清楚 地球什么时候毁灭
Your job is to figure out when this is all gonna fall apart.

316
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:59,450
我的任务是设法在世界毁灭后 维持政府的存在
My job is to figure out how to retain some type of government after it falls apart.

317
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:03,530
现在我们没时间管别的 懂了吗?
Until then we don't have time for anything except those jobs. Okay?

318
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:07,370
- 黄石公园那边有什么消息立刻告诉我 - 知道了
- You call me when you have any news from Yellowstone. - Yes Sir

319
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,300
- 很靓吧? - 什么?
- Cute girl, huh? - Sir?

320
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,900
第一千金啊 我看到你盯着她看了
The First Daughter, I saw you looking at her.

321
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,460
- 我没有 - 动作快点 孩子
- I wasn't looking at her. - Better move fast kid

322
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,230
世界末日快到了
The end is near.

323
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,930
艾德里安 你的直升机准备好了
Adrian, your chopper's ready.

324
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:23,600
他们正在白宫南草坪等你
They're waiting on the south lawn.

325
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:30,270
- 爹地 我们这是去哪儿? - 去一个很特别的地方
- Daddy, where are we going? - Going to a really special place I know.

326
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,110
以前我和妈妈经常去那里
Actually, it's a place where your mom and I used to hang out a lot.

327
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,610
我可不想去你和妈妈亲热的地方
I don't want to know where you and mom had sex.

328
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,910
我还太小了 杰克逊
I'm not ready for that, Jackson.

329
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,950
别这样叫我 这让我很不舒服
Stop calling me that, it's creeping me out.

330
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,610
叫我"爸爸"这么难吗?
What's wrong with "Dad"?

331
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,830
爹地 快看
Daddy, look at this.

332
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,450
以前这里没有围起来
That wasn't here before.

333
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,730
怎么办?
What did I do?

334
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,750
我去捡帽子
Go get your hat.

335
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,080
禁区    警告

336
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,050
你们没看见警告吗?
Don't you see the signs?

337
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,980
以前这里是个湖
There used to be a lake here.

338
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,320
怎么看都不像是湖
Doesn't look much of a lake to me.

339
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,850
我知道 整个湖都不见了
I know. The whole damn thing's gone.

340
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:15,900
来吧 我们去看看怎么回事
Come on, let's check it out.

341
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,360
好极了
Great.

342
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,470
目标进入热区
Subjects have now entered hot zone.

343
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,980
他们是谁?
Who is that?

344
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,440
美国陆军
It's the U.S. Army.

345
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,000
政府部队正向目标接近
All manner of government vehicle are converging on subjects.

346
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,630
这里是禁区 先生
You're in a restricted area, sir.

347
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,330
你和你的家人请跟我们走
We need you and your family to come with us.

348
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:21,000
好的 现在我们跟这些人走
Right. Okay, we're gonna go with these guys.

349
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,260
很好玩 对吧?
That'll be fun, huh?

350
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:29,390
太疯狂了 实在是太疯狂了
This is wild. This is really wild.

351
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:44,730
简直不敢相信 地下12千米 温度2700度?
This is unbelievable. 2700℃ at 40,000 feet?

352
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,790
我知道 这听起来不可思议
I know, it sounds completely implausible.

353
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:50,370
但温度确实在以0.5%的幅度上升
Nonetheless, we're noticing an increase of almost 0.5%

354
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,180
- 每天? - 不是
- Per day? - No.

355
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:53,380
每小时
Per hour.

356
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:57,040
赫尔姆斯利博士 我们从热区抓回了3个游客
Dr. Helmsley, we arrested some tourists in the hot zone.

357

我来处理吧
I'll take care of it.

358
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:01,630
你去跟萨特南联系
Let's get Satnam on the communications link.

359
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,140
对比一下这些数据
Try to cross reference the data.

360
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:06,330
这里是国家公园 不该有围栏吧?
It's a national park, there's not supposed to be fences, right?

361
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,430
我的意思是 发生什么事了?
I mean, what's going on here?

362
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,550
我们是地质学家
We're geologists.

363
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,560
你们用机关枪挖地?
You usually go digging with machine guns?

364
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,940
少校 我来处理就好 谢谢!
Major, I'll take care of this, thank you.

365
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:18,580
那个湖怎么了?
So, what happened to the lake?

366
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:20,320
这正是我们要调查的
Well, that's what we're trying to find out.

367
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,550
我们发现这里变得很不稳定
We think the entire area has become unstable.

368
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,340
你应该带着你的孩子离开这里 
I think you should take your kids and leave, Mr....

369
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,030
柯蒂斯先生
Curtis.

370
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:32,160
你该不会就是《再见亚特兰蒂斯》的作者 杰克逊・柯蒂斯吧?
You're not by any chance the Jackson Curtis who wrote "Farewell Atlantis"?

371
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:35,660
正是在下
The very same.

372
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,630
那本书是献给我妈妈的
It's actually dedicated to my mom.

373
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:45,590
我大学时读过一些你的短篇小说
I read a couple of your short stories in college.

374
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:49,300
- 你爸爸是个很有才华的人 - 听到了吧
- Your father is a very, very talented man. - Listen up.

375
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:51,310
真巧 我正在读你的书
It's amazing. I'm reading your book.

376
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,530
看到第300天 太空船与地球失去了联系
I'm around day 300, the shuttle has just lost communication with Earth.

377
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,430
很少有人买这本书
You're one of the lucky few who bought it.

378
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,690
- 我没买 - 没买?
- I didn't buy it. - No?

379
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,690
我老爸送我的
My dad gave it to me.

380
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,760
我想问你一些事
Let me ask you something.

381
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,850
你真的相信在生死关头
Do you think those people would behave so selflessly

382
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,820
人们会那么无私吗?
knowing that their own lives were at stake?

383
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,700
我希望是
I hope so.

384
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:14,080
评论家说我太天真 是个幼稚的乐观主义者
The critics said I was naive, an unabashed optimist,

385
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,790
可他们又懂什么呢 对吧?
but what do they know, right?

386
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,500
- 很荣幸认识你 - 我也是
- It was a great pleasure meeting you. - Thank you.

387
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:23,170

Mayor, could you escort these good people to the camp grounds, please.

388
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,570

他人不错
He was very nice.

392
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,220
你这样说是因为他喜欢我的书吧
You're just saying that cause he likes my book.

393
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,990
看来你儿子会比我们都聪明
Looks like that boy of yours is gonna be smarter than any of us.

394
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:45,950
怎么了?
What's wrong?

395
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:49,030
我把温度数据发给他了
I sent Satnam the temperature readings.

396
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:53,250
你的数据 与我在阿根廷和安大略的同事测到的数据 几乎一样
My colleagues in Argentina and Ontario have almost identical data.

397
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,660
这里太热 我们只好把铜矿井封了
It's so hot here we've had to seal off the mine.

398
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:58,500
- 你仔细检查过数据了吗? - 我检查了3遍 我的朋友
- Did you double check the numbers? - I triple checked, my friend.

399
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:02,000
我希望是我们弄错了 但是 事实就是这样
I wish we were wrong, but, we're not.

400
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:06,460
地壳越来越不稳定了
The Earth's crust is destabilizing.

401
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:15,850
- 这太快了 - 艾德里安 你们必须开始撤离了
- It's too early. - Adrian. You have to begin the evacuation.

402
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,360
天啊
My God.

403
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:23,200
什么高科技 先进的设备
All our scientific advances, our fancy machines,

404
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,000
玛雅人几千年前就预测到了
the Mayans saw this coming thousands of years ago.

405
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,700
我以为还有很多时间
I thought we'd have more time.

406
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,670
好 我要你和家人赶快收拾行李
Okay, I want you to pack up your family.

407
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:52,010
我会安排飞机到新德里接你们
I'm gonna arrange an airlift from Delhi.

408

祝我们好运
And good luck.

410
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,310
阿吉特
Ajit.

411
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:09,400
我们要去坐大船了
We are going on a big ship.

412
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,930
等等 等等 等一等
Wait. Wait, wait. Wait

413
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,210
打扰了 就一个问题
Sorry. One question.

414
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:29,200
政府的人跟你们说了什么?
What did the government guys say to you?

415
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,340
说我们不该翻越围栏
They don't like us going over their fences and

416
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:38,850
还说这整个区域很不稳定
that the whole area back there is unstable.

417
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,220
"不稳定"? 他们说"不稳定"?
"Unstable"? They said "unstable"?

418
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:47,860
- 很好笑 哈哈哈 - 我们走
- That's funny. - Let's go.

419
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:54,030
"不稳定" 哈哈哈
"Unstable".

420
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,670
不只是黄石公园 长官
It's not just Yellowstone, sir.

421
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,800
全球所有热区的温度
Temperatures are rising with incredible velocity

422
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,380
都在急剧上升
in hot zones across the globe.

423
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:07,970
艾德里安 你百分之百的确定吗?
Are you absolutely sure about this, Adrian?

424
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,050
一旦命令发布 就无法撤销了 你明白的
Because once we give these orders, there's no going back. You understand that.

425
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,220
恐怕没有时间犹豫了 长官
I'm afraid there's no longer any doubt, sir.

426
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,130
我们得尽可能的多救人
We have to save what we can.

427
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:19,680
我们得马上撤离
And we have to move now!

428
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,200
黄 石 国 家 公 园
政府管制区

429
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:53,590
这里好多蚊子 你没带防蚊液吗?
There's mosquitoes in here. Did anybody spray the tent?

430
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,680
我明天就去买
I'm gonna get that spray tomorrow.

431
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,590
蚊子喜欢你 是因为你的血太甜了
They just like you because your blood's so sweet.

432
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:02,180
爹地 你说过不写书的
Dad, you said you wouldn't work on your book.

433
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,100
什么?
What?

434
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,310
我没写书 我在做别的事
I'm not, I'm not. I'm doing something else.

435
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,690
好吧
Okay.

436
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,650
你真需要这么多帽子吗?
Did you really need all these hats?

437
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:17,030
你的那个东西呢?
Where are your pull-ups?

438
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,610
我已经穿上了
I have them on.

439
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,530
谁给你的 妈妈?
Who gave you this? Mommy?

440
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:30,120
不 这是戈登送我的生日礼物
No, Gordon gave it to me for my birthday.

441
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:34,200
买手机应该经过家庭讨论吧
A cell phone is something we got to talk about. You know, as a family.

442
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,420
什么家庭啊?
What family?

443
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,850
你这么说让我很伤心
It hurts my feelings when you say stuff like that.

444
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,320
大人也会伤心的
Adults get hurt feelings too.

445
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,220
嘿！戈登， 露营糟透了！

446
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:15,040
不可能
No way.

447
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,260
你是唯一敢说出真相的人
You're brave to tell the truth.

448
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,390
谢谢你 比尔 你有什么问题?
Thank you, Bill. What is your question?

449
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:21,180
我想知道这一切会从哪里开始?
I wanted to know, where is all this gonna start?

450
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,200
一般这都是好莱坞的好戏
Well, something like this could only originate in Hollywood Bill.

451
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:27,180
不过说真的 加州的地面已经在开裂了
But, they have the earth cracking under their asses already.

452
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:30,500
我们全家都信仰耶稣
Our family believes in the gospel of the lord Jesus.

453
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,820
我们无所畏惧 查理
We have nothing to fear, Charlie.

454
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,820
那太好了 比尔 感谢你的来电
Good for you, Bill. Thanks for calling.

455
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:38,900
我是查理・弗罗斯特 在黄石公园为您现场直播
This is Charlie Frost reporting live from Yellowstone National Park,

456
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,300
这里马上将成为世界上最大的活火山
soon to become the world's largest active volcano.

457
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:46,620
朋友们 马上回来
I'll be right back, folks.

458
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,660
介意我打扰下吗?
Do you mind if I join you?

459
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,370
我想问你点事
I wanted to ask you something.

460
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:56,340
我时间不多 吃泡菜吗?
I only got a minute. Pickle?

461
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:57,540
不了
No

462
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:00,260
我刚在收听你的节目 我好奇的是
I was listening to the broadcast and I was wondering

463
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,980
到底是什么会从好莱坞开始?
what exactly is it that's gonna start in Hollywood?

464
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:08,060
是末世 世界末日
It's the Apocalypse. End of days.

465
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:11,730
审判日 世界末日 我的朋友
The Judgment Day. The end of the world, my friend.

466
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:15,100
基督徒称之为"被提时刻" 但玛雅人很早就预言了
Christians call it The Rapture, but the Mayans knew about it.

467
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:21,540
霍皮人 易经 圣经也都说过
The Hopis, the I Ching, the Bible, kind of.

468
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:24,410
- 要啤酒吗? - 好
- Beer? - Yeah.

469
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,170
你看 我得吃饭了
So look, I gotta eat.

470
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:28,970
你何不到我的博客里下载呢?
Why don't you download my blog?

471
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,710
免费的 当然我们也欢迎捐款
It's free. Of course, we do appreciate donations.

472
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,900
数千年前 玛雅文明最先发现
In ancient times, the Mayan people were the first civilization to discover that

473
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,100
地球是有期限的
this planet had an expiration date.

474
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:45,900
根据他们的历法 2012年将会有毁灭性的灾难降临
According to their calender, in the year 2012 a cataclysmic event will unfold,

475
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:48,900
因为太阳系的全部行星排成一条直线
caused by an alignment of the planets in our solar system

476
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:53,280
这种现象每64万年才发生一次
that only happens every 640,000 years.

477
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,910
噢 别又来了
Oh, not again.

478
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:59,280
不错吧? 这动画都是我自己做的
Neat, huh? I did all the animation myself.

479
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,990
把地球想象成一个橙子
Just imagine the earth as an orange.

480
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:05,430
先用幽默吸引他们
You lure them in with humor.

481
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,590
然后让他们去思考
Then you make them think.

482
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:11,080
太阳将释放出大量的射线
Our sun will begin to emit such extreme amounts of radiation,

483
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:13,510
钉死你个浑蛋 来点中微子吧
Screw you bastards. Do you call neutrinos?

484
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:17,250
首先 地心开始熔化
That the core of the earth will melt at the inside part of the orange.

485
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,270
然后地壳就可以自由移动
Leaving the crust of our planet free to shift.

486
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:25,500
1958年 查尔斯・哈普古德教授 将此理论命名为 "地壳漂移"
In 1958 Professor Charles Hapgood named it:"Earth Crust Displacement".

487
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:28,570
阿尔伯特・爱因斯坦也支持这个理论
Albert Einstein did support it.

488
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,900
人类将完全感受到
People will get it all.

489
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,900
地球母亲的毁灭性力量
The forces of Mother Nature will be so devastating.

490
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:39,070
世界末日就在2012年12月21日冬至那天
It will bring an end to this world on winter Solstice 12-21-12.

491
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:43,450
听众们要记住 是查理・弗罗斯特最先告诉你们的
Always remember, folks. You heard it first from Charlie Frost.

492
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,250
政府会想法设法保守这个秘密
You'd have to keep a thing like this under wraps.

493
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,830
道理很简单
I mean, just think about it.

494
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,830
首先 股市会崩盘
First, the stock market would go.

495
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:54,210
然后 经济崩溃 嘣!
Then the economy: Boom!

496
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,460
美元狂跌 嘣!
The dollar: Boom!

497
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,760
还有街头骚乱
And then pandemonium in the street.

498
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:01,680
战争 种族灭绝 嘣! 嘣! 嘣!
War, genocide. Boom! Boom! Boom!

499
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,100
胡说 没人能守得住这么大的秘密 查理
Bullshit. Nobody could keep that big a secret, Charlie.

500
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:06,100
一定会有人说出来的
Somebody would blow the whistle

501
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:10,020
没错 每过一段时间就会有可怜虫想说出来
An every once in a while, some poor little sucker tries.

502
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:12,610
就像这些家伙 嘣! 嘣!
Like these guys. Boom! Boom!

503
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:16,610
所有这些人 死了! 死了! 死了!
Every one of these guys. Dead! Dead! Dead!

504
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,740
等等 这是梅耶教授
Woah, that's Professor Meyers.

505
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:25,200
他负责亚特兰蒂斯宇宙飞船计划 你认识他?
He ran the Atlantis Shuttle Program. Did you know him?

506
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,040
对 写书时他帮了我很多
Yeah, he helped me out with research on my book.

507
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:30,580
那一定是在他出事之前
Well, that must have been before his accident.

508
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:34,080
- 梅耶教授死了? - 对 两个月前
- Meyers is dead? - Yeah, two months ago.

509
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:37,630
他是我的狂热听众之一
He was one of my most avid listeners.

510
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,200
他全都弄清楚了
He had it all figured out.

511
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:42,760
政府在做什么 怎么做 在哪里
Everything the government was doing, where, why.

512
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:45,760
他甚至寄给我一张地图
He even sent me a map.

513
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,810
什么地图 查理? 什么地图? 
A map for what, Charlie? What's the map for?

514
00:33:55,150 --> 00:34:00,400
他们在造太空船 伙计
They're building space ships, man.

515
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:11,330
胡扯 我得走了 我要回地球去了
Shit, man, I have to go. Because, I gotta get back to Earth.

516
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,120
- 你还有啤酒吗? - 这是最后一罐
- Do you have a beer? - This is my last.

517
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,740
好吧 我真是大开眼界了
Alright, anyway, I really enjoyed most of this.

518
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,100
非常感谢你
Thank you so much.

519
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,220
知道吗? 他们在卖座位!
Guess what, they're selling seats!

520
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,220
给我留三张
Put me down for three.

521
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,770
不可能 像我们这种普通人是没有机会的
No! Guys like you and me don't have any chance.

522
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:31,100
除非是你比尔・盖茨 默多克 或者俄罗斯的亿万富翁才行
You'd have to be Bill Gates or Rupert Murdoch, or some Russian billionaire.

523
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,610
小点声 我的孩子睡着了
Keep it down, my kids are sleeping.

524
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:38,400
快带他们离开黄石公园 这里很危险
Get them out of Yellowstone. It's gonna get ugly here.

525
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,280
我们生个孩子吧?
Why don't we make a baby?

526
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,800
在超市里可没办法生孩子
We're not making a baby at the supermarket.

527
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:52,910
嘿 快把手拿开
Hands off the merchandise.

528
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:57,400
亲爱的 别的女人要我摸她们的胸部要花好几千块钱
Honey, woman give me thousands of dollars to handle their boobs.

529
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,710
你可是免费的
You get it for free.

530
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,110
每次见过他后 你都会很反常
You always act strange after he shows up.

531
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:23,690
我没有反常 我只是在找通心粉
I'm not acting strange, I'm looking for macaroni.

532
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:29,120
你怎么会和他在一起这么久呢?
So why did you stick with him so long anyways?

533
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,200
不说这个可以吗?
Can we just give it a rest, please?

534
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:33,620
- 他是孩子的父亲 - 算了吧, 凯特
- He's the father of my children. - Oh, come on, Kate

535
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,750
为了生诺亚 你放弃了去医学院深造
You gave up med school so you could have Noah.

536
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:38,000
你一个人辛苦的把诺亚和莉莉带大
You practically raised him and Lilly by yourself

537
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:40,610
可他却只会呆呆的坐在电脑前写那些垃圾
while he sat glued to a laptop writing that junk.

538
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:42,800
那不是垃圾 已经出版了
It's not junk! He's published.

539
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,550
对 我忘了 是出版了
Oh, published. Right, I forgot.

540
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:47,720
卖了422本
422 copies.

541
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:04,490
- 你看见了吗? - 看见什么?
- Did you see that? - See what?

542
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,740
凯特 听着 我们必须要改善
Kate, listen, we have to keep working at this.

543
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,280
我们之间的关系
Our relationship.

544
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:14,700
亲爱的 我总感觉有什么东西要将我们分开
I don't know, Honey, I feel like there's something pulling us apart.

我们可以救超过40万人

01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:01,230
黄石公园火山爆发了 长官
The Yellowstone Caldera has erupted, sir.

951
01:08:01,270 --> 01:08:04,060
火山灰将在7小时后到达华盛顿
The ash cloud will reach Washington in 7 hours.

952
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,230
我们得赶快让总统上飞机
We've to get the president on board.

953
01:08:08,610 --> 01:08:09,800
总统在哪儿 萨莉?
Where is the president, Sally?

954
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,700
他说想一个人静一静
Said he wanted to spend some time alone.

955
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:14,660
- 我觉得他在小教堂里 - 他现在还去教堂?
- I think he's at the chapel. - He's going to church now?

956
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:18,700
他正在祷告 长官 现在除了祈祷还能干什么
He's praying, sir. Which is not such a bad idea.

957
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:26,420
总统先生 请您立刻上空军一号
Mr. President. I need to get you on Air Force One immediately.

958
01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:30,010
让我和艾德里安单独待一会
Give me a moment with Adrian.

959
01:08:30,050 --> 01:08:32,340
不是冒犯 但我们确实没时间了
No disrespect sir, we do not have time.

960
01:08:32,380 --> 01:08:33,900
挤出时间
Make time.

961
01:08:46,230 --> 01:08:49,220
你见过我太太桃乐西吗?
Did you ever meet my wife: Dorothy?

962
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:52,500
没有 总统先生 我没有这福气
No, sir, I never had that honor.

963
01:08:53,530 --> 01:08:56,450
她去世前一会清醒 一会昏迷
She was in and out towards the end.

964
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:01,500
就在她去世前 她拉着我的手说
The night before she passed on, she took my hand and told me:

965
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:05,170
"我觉得你该去抽奖"
"I think you should have a lottery"

966
01:09:06,210 --> 01:09:09,300
"每个人都该有中奖的机会"
"Everyone should have a chance to go"

967
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:14,980
也许我们早该这么做
Maybe that's what we should have done.

968
01:09:17,550 --> 01:09:22,130
我将是美利坚合众国的最后一位总统
I'll be the last president of the United States of America.

969
01:09:22,770 --> 01:09:24,800
你知道这是什么感觉吗 孩子?
Do you know how that feels, son?

970
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:28,500
没人能够拯救美国 总统先生
No one could have saved the country, sir.

971
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:34,200
但我想 人民有权知道真相
And I think, I think people have a right to know.

972
01:09:35,650 --> 01:09:38,000
别担心 我会处理的
Don't worry, I'll take care of that.

973
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:41,000
你快走吧
Go on now.

974
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:45,000
我不会丢下您的 总统先生
Not without you, sir.

975
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:49,000
快上飞机吧 孩子
Get on that plane, son.

976
01:09:49,670 --> 01:09:53,000
你要去的是个崭新的世界
It's a brave new world you head into.

977
01:09:53,210 --> 01:09:58,700
一个年轻的科学家抵得上20个老政客
And a young scientist will be worth 20 old politicians.

978
01:10:09,610 --> 01:10:13,360
米卡兰国际机场
拉斯维加斯

979
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:19,200
我们应该去落基山接我父母
We should go to my parents house in the Rockies.

980
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:22,240
这不会是你要写的疯狂故事吧 杰克逊?
This isn't one of your crazy stories, now. Right, Jackson?

981
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:23,540
我们怎么去得了中国?
How the hell are we going to make it to China?

982
01:10:23,570 --> 01:10:24,590
嘿 戈登
Hey, Gordon.

983
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:26,910
没有杰克逊 我们连加州都逃不出来
Without Jackson we wouldn't have made it out of California.

984
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,000
诺亚 别插嘴
Noah, please.

985
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,850
小心 别弄坏起落架
Be careful with the landing gear!

986
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:41,140
别紧张 我知道自己在做什么
Easy gringo, I know what I'm doing.

987
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:44,000
大家注意 国民警卫队刚刚通知我们
Attention! The National Guard has informed us that

988
01:10:44,050 --> 01:10:47,520
一团极度危险的火山灰 正往拉斯维加斯飘来
an extremely hazardous ash cloud is headed for the city of Las Vegas.

989
01:10:47,550 --> 01:10:49,000
你要去哪儿?
Where are you going?

990
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:51,150
请全体人员进入室内

991
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:52,910
快走 你不能待在这里
Move! You can't stay here.

992
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:55,530
- 我的飞机在这里 - 这里不安全
- I have a plane here. - It's not safe.

993
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:08,920
这消息你确认过了吗?
So you got positive confirmation on this?

994
01:11:10,210 --> 01:11:12,250
谢谢你 我了解了
Thank you, I understand.

995
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,810
总统先生不来了
The President is not coming.

996
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:35,350
听着 船长不愿舍弃他下沉的的船
So, the Captain doesn't want to abandon his sinking ship.

997
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:39,000
那是他的抉择 高尚的抉择
That's his choice, and a noble one.

998
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:43,240
我也刚收到消息 副总统的直升机
I have also just learned that the Vice President's chopper

999
01:11:43,570 --> 01:11:46,900
在匹兹堡外的火山灰中坠毁了
went down in the ash cloud outside Pittsburgh.

1000
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:51,370
幸运的是 我们还有宪法可循
Fortunately, we have protocols to follow.

1001
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:52,800
那众议院议长呢?
What about the Speaker of the House?

1002
01:11:52,830 --> 01:11:54,740
这么混乱 我哪知道他在哪儿?
In this chaos, I have no idea. Where is he?

1003
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:55,850
现在他应该是总指挥 长官
He's the Commander in Chief now, sir.

1004
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:59,520
谁让他迟到了 这趟飞机不等人的
I don't know what to tell you. This is one flight he shouldn't be late for.

1005
01:11:59,970 --> 01:12:01,270
告诉机长 准备起飞
Tell the Captain we're taking off.

1006
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:03,000
长官 你没有这个权力
Sir, you don't have the authority.

1007
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:05,470
谁有这个权利? 你吗?
Who got the authority? You? You got the authority?

1008
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:07,400
你连自己的嘴都管不住
You couldn't even keep your damn mouth shut.

1009
01:12:07,430 --> 01:12:09,980
去年你泄露了最高机密 差点把我们全害死
You betrayed top secret information.

1010
01:12:10,010 --> 01:12:11,150
你在胡说什么?
What the hell are you talking about?

1011
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:14,310
你把一切都告诉了你父亲 使整个计划处于危险之中
You told your father everything, put this entire plan in jeopardy.

1012
01:12:14,350 --> 01:12:17,400
幸好你父亲的嘴闭得比你紧
Good thing for you, the old man could keep his mouth shut better than you.

1013
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:18,950
拜托 别这么吃惊
Oh, come on. Don't look so shocked.

1014
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:20,490
我们必须监控所有人
We had to monitor everybody who knew.

1015
01:12:20,530 --> 01:12:22,520
不然怎么能把秘密保守到今天?
How do you think we kept it a secret for so long?

1016
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:24,800
所以你就杀了所有想说出真相的人?
So you just killed anybody who tried to talk?

1017
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:28,000
泄密的人不仅是国家的敌人
Anybody who tried to talk was not just an enemy of the state.

1018
01:12:28,050 --> 01:12:29,790
更是人类的公敌
They were an enemy of humanity.

1019
01:12:29,830 --> 01:12:32,160
卢浮宫博物馆馆长是人类公敌?
The director of the Louvre was an enemy of humanity?

1020
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:34,560
他决定召开记者招待会 他就是
After he called a press conference, he was.

1021
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:37,510
天啊 你想怎样呢?
Jesus, what did you think?

1022
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:40,840
所有人通通都上船 手拉手唱赞歌?
We're all just gonna get on board, hold hands and sing Kumbaya?

1023
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,000
给我坐下 系好安全带
Sit down and buckle up.

1024
01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:55,800
对不起 我父亲在指挥中心吗?
Excuse me, is my father in the Command Center?

1025
01:12:56,310 --> 01:12:58,400
总统先生刚打电话过来 威尔逊博士
President is on the line, Dr. Wilson.

1026
01:12:59,860 --> 01:13:01,300
谢谢
Thank you.

1027
01:13:08,030 --> 01:13:09,100
你在哪里?
Where are you?

1028
01:13:09,410 --> 01:13:12,870
如果我告诉你 你就不会上飞机了
You never would've gotten on that plane if I told you.

1029
01:13:15,370 --> 01:13:19,000
- 但你说过你会和我一起的 - 我的孩子 听我说
- But you said that you'd be here. - Darling, listen to me.

1030
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:21,500
知道你可以活着
Do you understand how much strength it gives me

1031
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:24,000
就是给我的最大鼓励
knowing that you will survive?

1032
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:27,800
我现在唯一要做的事
The only thing left to do now,

1033
01:13:28,970 --> 01:13:31,220
就是告诉人民真相
is tell the truth to people.

1034
01:13:32,270 --> 01:13:34,400
至少他们知道后
At least if they know,

1035
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:40,400
家人间还可以彼此告别
families can say goodbye to each other.

1036
01:13:41,110 --> 01:13:44,000
母亲能安慰她的孩子
A mother can comfort her children.

1037
01:13:46,530 --> 01:13:48,000
而父亲
And a father...

1038
01:13:50,530 --> 01:13:53,160
可以请求女儿原谅自己
can ask his daughter for forgiveness.

1039
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:05,000
您准备好了就开始 总统先生
Whenever you're ready, Mr President.

1040
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:15,400
美国同胞们
My fellow Americans,

1041
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:18,800
这是我最后一次发表讲话
this will be the last time I address you.

1042
01:14:20,150 --> 01:14:24,800
正如大家知道的 灾难席卷了美国
As you know, catastrophe has struck our nation,

1043
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:28,800
也将席卷整个世界
has struck the world.

1044
01:14:29,150 --> 01:14:31,460
真希望我可以告诉你们
I wish I could tell you

1045
01:14:31,490 --> 01:14:34,300
我们有能力抵御这场灾难
we could prevent the coming destruction.

1046
01:14:34,910 --> 01:14:36,500
但我们无能为力
We cannot.

1047
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:40,400
今天 没有人是陌生人
Today, none of us are strangers.

1048
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:44,420
今天 我们都是一家人
Today, we are one family,

1049
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:47,880
一起走进黑暗
stepping into the darkness together.

1050
01:14:47,930 --> 01:14:51,100
我们可能信仰不同
We are a nation of many religions,

1051
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:57,520
但我相信这句话 可以代表我们共同的信仰
but I believe these words reflect the spirit of all our faiths:

1052
01:14:57,810 --> 01:15:01,000
耶和华是我的牧者 我必...
"The lord is my Shepard. I shall... "

1053
01:14:57,810 --> 01:15:01,000
出自《圣经.诗篇23篇》

1054
01:15:02,650 --> 01:15:06,000
大家不要靠近门和窗户
People! Get away from the doors and windows.

1055
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:08,600
我们怎么办? 你告诉我
What are we gonna do? You tell me.

1056
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:11,700
- 西尔伯曼医生? - 塔玛拉!
- Dr. Silberman? - Tamara!

1057
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:13,900
你怎么会在这?
What are you doing here?

1058
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:15,450
她是我的病人 亲爱的
She's a patient, Honey.

1059
01:15:15,490 --> 01:15:19,080
不好意思 我的私人飞机停在外面
Excuse me, I have a private plane out there.

1060
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:22,000
卡尔波夫! 尤里!
Karpov! Yuri!

1061
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:24,590
你知道真相 你一直都知道
You knew. This whole time you knew.

1062
01:15:24,630 --> 01:15:27,170
你有办法离开 对吧? 你有飞机
You've got a way out of here, right? You got a plane?

1063
01:15:27,210 --> 01:15:29,800
带我的家人一起走 求你了!
My family, take us with you. Please!

1064
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,900
老板 老板
Boss, boss.

1065
01:15:32,180 --> 01:15:34,010
我找到了一架飞机 一架安东诺夫
I found us a plane. An Antonov.

1066
01:15:34,050 --> 01:15:37,000
他们刚才要起飞 但控制塔不准他们起飞
They were just about to take off, but the tower didn't let them.

1067
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:39,500
你会飞那家伙吗?
Can you still fly that thing?

1068
01:15:39,550 --> 01:15:43,200
- 没问题 老板 不过我需要一个副驾驶 - 完了
- Sure, Boss, but I need co-pilot. - No.

1069
01:15:43,470 --> 01:15:45,000
戈登是飞行员
Gordon's a pilot.

1070
01:15:45,910 --> 01:15:48,240
不 我不是 我不是
No, I'm not. I'm not.

1071
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:51,070
他就是 很棒的飞行员 快走吧
Yes he is. Great pilot. Let's go.

1072
01:15:51,110 --> 01:15:53,630
太好了 我们走!
Good. Let's go!

1073
01:15:53,870 --> 01:15:56,300
杰克逊 别再说我是飞行员了
Jackson, stop saying I'm a pilot.

1074
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:00,700
你们不能出去 回来!
You can't go out there. Come back!

1075
01:16:05,790 --> 01:16:08,210
后退 大家快后退!
Move back, people!

1076
01:16:13,890 --> 01:16:16,510
哇 真是架大飞机
Wow, that's a big plane.

1077
01:16:16,930 --> 01:16:19,560
俄罗斯造的
It's Russian.

1078
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:21,730
大家快上去 快点!
Let's move everybody. Come on!

1079
01:16:26,730 --> 01:16:29,320
- 戈登 你在哪儿? - 我来了!
- Gordon, where are you? - Let's go!

1080
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:31,400
快上来 戈登 快点!
Up here, Gordon. Hurry up!

1081
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:35,530
我的上帝 又来了
Oh my God. Not again.

1082
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,000
2012
拉斯维加斯车展

1083
01:16:42,790 --> 01:16:46,420
- 哇哦 好酷啊 - 拉斯维加斯车展
- Woah, look at these. - Las Vegas auto show.

1084
01:16:46,450 --> 01:16:49,300
我们还有贵宾卡
We had VIP tickets for this.

1085
01:16:49,350 --> 01:16:51,050
太好了 我们走吧
That's fantastic, let's go.

1086
01:16:51,090 --> 01:16:54,180
检查液压系统 我来平衡油箱
Check the main bus for hydraulics, I'll balance the tanks.

1087
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:55,300
什么?
What?

1088
01:16:56,890 --> 01:16:59,140
好的 我尽力 我尽力试试
Okay, okay. I'm trying. Okay? I'm trying.

1089
01:17:01,310 --> 01:17:03,390
控制塔呼叫安东诺夫 你们到底在干什么?
Tower to Antonov, what the hell are you doing?

1090
01:17:03,430 --> 01:17:04,700
立刻停下来
Shut down immediately.

1091
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:13,570
凯撒 乖
Caesar, shh.

1092
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:17,200
我一说"走" 就把它推到底 明白吗?
When I say "go", we push all this down at once, okay?

1093
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:18,830
- 明白 - 走!
- Okay. - Go!

1094
01:17:18,870 --> 01:17:23,080
安东诺夫 停止起飞 你没有起飞许可
Antonov, abort take-off. You do not have clearance.

1095
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:25,600
重复 停止起飞!
I repeat, you must abort.

1096
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:33,000
刚怎么回事?
What the hell was that?

1097
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:35,500
不知道 但听起来不妙
I don't know, but it's not good.

1098
01:17:37,890 --> 01:17:39,800
- 推! - 正在推!
- Push! - Pushing!

1099
01:17:44,350 --> 01:17:46,700
要掉下去了! 要掉下去了!
We're going down! We're going down!

1100
01:17:55,450 --> 01:17:57,820
- 什么? - 肯定是泵出问题了! 你接手!
- What? - It must be the pump. Take over.

1101
01:17:57,870 --> 01:18:00,000
接手? 什么我接手?
Take over? What do you mean take over?

1102
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:04,660
- 萨沙! - 别紧张
- Sasha! - Relax.

1103
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,880
上帝! 我的上帝啊!
God! God! Jesus!

1104
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:17,000
- 哦上帝! - 我搞定了
- Oh God! - I think I got it

1105
01:18:17,050 --> 01:18:19,720
- 萨沙 快来! - 深呼吸
- Sasha, now! - Take a deep breath.

1106
01:18:20,350 --> 01:18:21,810
拉!
Pull!

1107
01:18:23,430 --> 01:18:27,020
宝贝 快把屁股抬起来

1108
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:50,200
那是埃菲尔铁塔?
Was that the Eiffel Tower?

1109
01:18:51,170 --> 01:18:53,400
大概是吧
I think so.

1110
01:19:00,390 --> 01:19:05,000
女士们先生们 我们正飞往中国
Ladies and Gentlemen. We're on our way to China.

1111
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:09,200
好 非常好
Good. Very good.

1112
01:19:19,610 --> 01:19:24,400
不要相信那些传闻 尼玛

1113
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:28,830
师傅 可丹增是我哥哥

1114
01:19:28,910 --> 01:19:32,290
他在造大船的隧道里工作

1115
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:40,140
如果丹增说得没错 世界末日真的来了

1116
01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:44,560
以仁波切的智慧 您会怎么做?

1117
01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:44,560
仁波切是对西藏佛法成就者的尊称

1118
01:19:52,650 --> 01:19:56,190
已经满了 仁波切

1119
01:19:57,110 --> 01:19:58,570
别再倒了

1120
01:20:01,570 --> 01:20:09,080
就像这个杯子 你的内心被恐惧与猜疑所填满

1121
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:15,000
想要看到智慧之光 你先要平静你的内心

1122
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:33,900
注意离合器

1123
01:20:34,270 --> 01:20:36,690
不好挂档

1124
01:20:54,460 --> 01:20:55,860
奶奶

1125
01:20:56,170 --> 01:20:58,180
他爷爷 尼玛来了

1126
01:20:58,210 --> 01:21:00,050
奶奶 丹增让我带个消息

1127
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:03,130
他叫我们去卓铭谷的工地找他

1128
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:07,300
他说有办法带我们上船

1129
01:21:07,340 --> 01:21:09,220
你在说什么呢?

1130
01:21:09,260 --> 01:21:11,810
丹增不是在建大坝吗?

1131
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:15,850
奶奶

1132
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:19,940
其实他们在建大船 政府骗了我们

1133
01:21:20,690 --> 01:21:22,610
洪水就要来了

1134
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,990
我们必须马上走

1135
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:28,030
尼玛 谁借给你的车?

1136
01:21:28,780 --> 01:21:34,920
有一次我们坐船 你爷爷吐了一路

1137
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,880
还是先吃饭吧

1138
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:47,510
- 瞧 新款宾利 - 我爸爸订过一辆
- Hey, look, the new Bentley! - Our father had one on order.

1139
01:21:47,550 --> 01:21:49,400
本来明年就能拿到
He was supposed to get it next year.

1140
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:52,890
但因为要坐大船 他又取消了
But then he canceled it. Because of the ships.

1141
01:21:52,930 --> 01:21:55,000
你们家有几辆车?
How many cars does your family have?

1142
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:59,190
我妈的男朋友有辆保时捷
My mom's boyfriend has a Porsche.

1143
01:21:59,230 --> 01:22:01,860
我们的爸妈也离婚了
Our parents are divorced too.

1144
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:03,990
是啊 我们对此也无能为力
Yeah, but there is nothing that we can do about that.

1145
01:22:04,030 --> 01:22:05,150
找到帽子了
Found a hat.

1146
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:07,580
她很喜欢帽子
She has a thing for hats.

1147
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:10,630
我在她这么大的时候也一样
I was just like that at her age.

1148
01:22:10,870 --> 01:22:12,750
帽子让我感到安全
They made me feel safe.

1149
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:17,170
那么 你是怎么认识西尔伯曼医生的?
So, how did you meet Dr. Silberman?

1150
01:22:17,410 --> 01:22:19,630
很明显 和你认识他的方式不同
As you can see, not the same way you did.

1151
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:26,130
我男朋友让我去隆胸
My boyfriend asked me to get them done.

1152
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:27,500
他不是你丈夫?
He's not your husband?

1153
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:32,470
不 我们没结婚 估计以后也不可能结婚
We are not married. And probably never will be.

1154
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:41,200
给你孩子的
For the boys.

1155
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:48,240
她们相处的不错
They seem to like each other.

1156
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
是啊
Yeah, I guess.

1157
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:56,400
说真的 卡尔波夫先生 你付了多少钱?
Tell me, Mr. Karpov, how much did you pay?

1158
01:22:56,580 --> 01:23:01,630
一个座位10亿欧元
One billion Euro. Per seat.

1159
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:05,430
- 真夸张 - 是吗?
- That's disgusting. - Oh yeah?

1160
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,400
你知道的 柯蒂斯 我以前不是生意人
You know, Curtis, I wasn't always a businessman.

1161
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:12,400
我是个拳击手
I am a boxer.

1162
01:23:12,450 --> 01:23:17,000
我年轻时在摩尔曼斯克打拳
Was my only playing when I was boy back in Murmansk.

1163
01:23:17,070 --> 01:23:23,320
我的教练也叫尤里 他常常跟我说
And my coach, his name was also Yuri. He always said:

1164
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:29,820
"如果有人想击倒你 那他必须先杀了你"
"If someone wants to beat you he has to kill you first."

1165
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:34,500
说得好
That's very nice.

1166
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:41,200
告诉我 如果你和我一样有钱 你会像我这样做吗?
But tell me, what would you have done if you were rich like me?

1167
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:45,460
看 他们都是很棒的孩子
Look, they are wonderful children.

1168
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:50,260
各位注意 我们计划在夏威夷加油
OK, guys. The plan is to refill in Hawaii,

1169
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:52,300
请坐好并系上安全带
so sit down and buckle up.

1170
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:54,300
剩下的交给我和戈登
Gordon and I will do the rest.

1171
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,850
噢 上帝啊
Oh God.

1172
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:02,190
叫他们过来
Go get the guys.

1173
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:09,200
伙计们 有点问题... 你们也许该...
Guys, there's a... You might wanna...

1174
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:31,180
- 这是哪儿? - 夏威夷
- What is that? - The state of Hawaii

1175
01:24:31,220 --> 01:24:35,720
不好 非常不好
Not good. That is not good.

1176
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,450
- 我们还有多少油? - 不够了
- How much fuel do we have left? - Not enough.

1177
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:47,800
我们得在中国南海附近迫降
We have to make a water landing somewhere in South China sea.

1178
01:24:47,850 --> 01:24:50,900
好极了 至少不用起落架
Great, at least we won't need a landing gear.

1179
01:24:50,950 --> 01:24:54,280
- 起落架怎么了? - 都落在拉斯维加斯了
- What about it? - We lost it all, in Vegas.

1180
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:07,000
威尔逊博士 我可以进来吗?
Dr. Wilson, may I come in?

1181
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:09,960
不好意思 恐怕我的心情不太好
I'm not a very good company, I'm afraid.

1182
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:14,130
- 博士 - 叫我艾德里安就好
- Doctor... - Please, call me Adrian.

1183
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:21,800
对于所有不能上船的人
All those people we left behind.

1184
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:24,700
他们都没有机会了 对吗?
They don't stand a chance, do they?

1185
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:29,570
我相信大自然会作出选择的
I believe that nature will choose for itself,

1186
01:25:29,610 --> 01:25:32,530
从它自身来决定谁该继续生存
from itself, what will survive.

1187
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,000
就像你一样 保护那些伟大的艺术品
Just like you, preserving those great artworks.

1188
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:41,500
人类的文化就是我们的灵魂 今晚它不会灭亡
Our culture is our soul, and that's not dying tonight.

1189
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:45,600
拜托 我帮你们掩人耳目?
Come on, I contributed to this cover up?

1190
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:49,100
达・芬奇 毕加索 这些艺术品都上船了
The Da Vinci, Picasso, they're in.

1191
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:52,000
但如果你是无名小卒 你就没有机会
But if you're some nobody you don't stand a chance.

1192
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:55,720
这不一定完全正确
It's not necessarily true.

1193
01:25:56,200 --> 01:26:00,500
你听过一个叫杰克逊・柯蒂斯的作家吗?
Did you ever hear of a writer called Jackson Curtis?

1194
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:03,020
他写了一本书 《再见亚特兰蒂斯》
Wrote a book, "Farewell Atlantis".

1195
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:06,400
他的这本书只卖出了500本
What do you think the chances are of an unknown writer

1196
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:09,900
你觉得他的书能留存下来的概率是多少?
who barely sold 500 copies making it aboard this plane?

1197
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:13,000
我不明白
I don't understand.

1198
01:26:13,050 --> 01:26:16,600
无论这是机会或者信念或者命运 这些都不重要
I mean call it chance or faith or nature, doesn't matter.

1199
01:26:16,650 --> 01:26:20,200
这本书已经是我们的遗产了 为什么?
This book is part of our legacy now. Why?

1200
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,300
因为我正在读它
Because I'm reading it.

1201
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:29,900
赫尔姆斯利博士 请马上到指挥中心
Dr. Helmsley, please report to the situation room.

1202
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:44,000
喂 你是谁?

1203
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:46,140
你好 打扰了
Hello, I'm sorry.

1204
01:26:46,350 --> 01:26:49,100
- 请问你是哪位? - 我是洋子・德尔加多
- Who is this? - This is Yoko Delgado.

1205
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:51,500
你找我爹地吗?
Do you want to speak to my daddy?

1206
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:56,200
是的 麻烦你了
Yes, please.

1207
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:58,500
我要说是谁打来的呢?
Who should I say is calling?

1208
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:06,800
- 就说是他爸爸 - 你是我的爷爷?
- Tell him, its his father. - You're my grandpa?

1209
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:09,600
是的 宝贝 我是你爷爷
Yes, sweetheart, I am.

1210
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:14,590
爹地 爹地 爷爷来电话了
Daddy, Daddy, grandpa is on the phone.

1211
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:19,400
总统先生
Mr President, Sir.

1212
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:30,000
- 怎么了 宝贝? - 她找不到她爸爸了
- What's the matter, sweety? - She can't find her daddy.

1213
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:35,800
你们为什么不坐到沙发上去 那里舒服些 莎莉
Why don't you two get comfy on that couch? Sally.

1214
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:37,050
过来帮帮她们
Come here and help them.

1215
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:40,600
我去找你爸爸
I'll find your daddy.

1216
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:50,800
谁负责登记失踪人员?
Who can help me with missing persons?

1217
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,060
抱歉 老兄 我现在真的忙不过来
Sorry, man, I'm really busy right now.

1218
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:57,200
我是说没问题 不好意思 总统先生
I mean of course, sir. Sorry, Mr President.

1219
01:28:57,300 --> 01:28:59,990
没关系 孩子 你干得很好
Don't worry about it, you're doing a great job, son.

1220
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:29,100
- 怎么了? - 首都发生了9.4级地震
- What's happening? - The Capitol has been hit by a 9.4

1221
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:30,500
我们和白宫失去了联系 长官
Lost communication with the White House, sir.

1222
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:32,680
- 震中在哪里? - 北切萨皮克湾
- Where is it centered? - North Chesapeake Bay.

1223
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:40,300
安海斯先生 俄罗斯总统打来电话
Mr. Anheuser, Russian president on the line, sir.

1224
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,000
失陪一下
Excuse me.

1225
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:44,500
我们刚刚进入中国领空
We just entered Chinese air space.

1226
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:48,030
这是肯定的 总统先生
That's affirmative, Mr. President.

1227
01:29:48,070 --> 01:29:53,800
在恢复通讯之前 由我暂任总指挥
Until communication is restored, I suppose I am in command.

1228
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,800
其他国家的元首也都在去中国的途中
It appears that all other heads of state are enroute,

1229
01:29:56,900 --> 01:29:59,300
除了意大利总理
with the exception of the Italian Prime Minister,

1230
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:05,500
他也决定留下来向上天祈祷
Who has also decided to stay behind and trust in prayer.

1231
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,800
地壳开始移动了 赫尔姆斯利博士
Earth's crust has begun to shift, Dr. Helmsley!

1232
01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:17,600
- 移动了多少? - 1.2度 还在移动
- By what degree? - 1.2 degree. Still moving.

1233
01:31:17,700 --> 01:31:18,800
那接下来会怎么样?
So, what happens next?

1234
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:21,400
大陆位移结束之后
The movement of our land masses comes to a halt.

1235
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:22,900
让我们看看仿真图
Let's see a simulation.

1236
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:26,200
会形成巨大的海啸
Expect the formation of gigantic tsunamis.

1237
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:29,340
和地震强度成正比
Proportional to the magnitude of corresponding quakes.

1238
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:37,500
- 放大日本海的图像 - 是 长官
- Pull up the Japanese sea border. - Yes, sir.

1239
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:41,200
我爸爸在那附近的一条游轮上
My dad's on a cruise ship out there.

1240
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:44,600
不过我猜你早就知道了
But I guess you already knew that.

1241
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:50,000
长官 我们监测到了两次深海地震 分别是7.9级和8.2级
Sir, we've recorded two underwater quakes at 7.9 and 8.2.

1242
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:09,100
根据最新消息
From what we have just learned,

1243
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:12,100
东京发生了极其强烈的地震
Tokyo seems to have taken the full force of the earthquake.

1244
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:14,900
有消息称
At this point unconfirmed reports indicate that

1245
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,500
日本大片陆地已沉入海底
large areas of land are under water.

1246
01:32:29,900 --> 01:32:30,900
托尼
Tony.

1247
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,800
我打电话了
I called.

1248
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:38,600
但已经晚了
I was too late.

1249
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:46,300
可能他们逃出去了
Maybe they got out of town.

1250
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:47,700
谁也说不准
You never know...

1251
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:18,580
哈里!
Harry!

1252
01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:18,100
我来了 桃乐西
I'm coming home, Dorothy.

1253
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:46,500
有信号吗?
Anything?

1254
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:49,800
什么都没有
Nothing but static.

1255
01:34:49,860 --> 01:34:51,500
连紧急信号都没有
Not even an emergency signal.

1256
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:07,200
不敢想像地面上发生了什么
Can't think about what's going on down there.

1257
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:16,400
还记得我们以前露营时开的旧甲壳虫吗?
Remember that old Beetle we used to camp in?

1258
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:18,100
你从来没把顶棚打开过
But you'd never get the roof up.

1259
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:22,330
我们真该换辆车
We definitely traded up.

1260
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,200
带孩子出去玩时
Tried to find our old spot at Yellowstone.

1261
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:29,800
本想去黄石公园找我们的老地方 但是
When I went camping with the kids, but...

1262
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,000
我找不到了
I couldn't find it.

1263
01:35:41,180 --> 01:35:43,200
你觉得人会变吗?
Do you think people change?

1264
01:35:43,700 --> 01:35:45,700
你指的是我吗?
By people, do you mean me?

1265
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:46,900
对
Yes.

1266
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
我们分手后 你觉得你变了吗?
Do you think you've changed since we separated?

1267
01:35:50,980 --> 01:35:53,300
我也经常吃麦片粥了
I seem to eat a lot more cereal now.

1268
01:35:57,300 --> 01:35:59,500
你以前总是埋头写书
You always had tunnel vision.

1269
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:03,300
其他的什么你都不管
You could just block everything out and write.

1270
01:36:07,540 --> 01:36:09,710
也不管我们
You blocked us out.

1271
01:36:18,590 --> 01:36:20,090
你爱他吗?
Do you love him?

1272
01:36:22,930 --> 01:36:24,930
我很爱他
I love him enough.

1273
01:36:36,730 --> 01:36:40,150
全球的地面通讯都中断了 长官
All global ground communication is ceased, sir.

1274
01:36:43,990 --> 01:36:48,950
卫星只能接收到卓铭谷的信号
The only signals our satellites are picking up come from Cho Ming.

1275
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:51,600
这算是个好消息
Well there's a piece of good news.

1276
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:53,580
有新情况吗 博士?
Any updates, Doctor?

1277
01:36:53,670 --> 01:36:56,700
海啸将袭击各大洲
We expect the tsunamis to reach land fall on every continent.

1278
01:36:56,800 --> 01:37:00,500
卓铭谷也会在6小时后遭到海啸袭击
The Cho Ming area will be impacted in approximately 6 hours.

1279
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:06,600
地壳已经向西南方向移动了23度
It looks like the crust have shifted by almost 23 degrees to the southwest.

1280
01:37:07,430 --> 01:37:08,900
数据显示
The data also shows

1281
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,900
地球两极的磁场分布也颠倒了
the Earth's poles have reversed their magnetic fields.

1282
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:14,270
这是它们的新位置
These are their new positions.

1283
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:19,990
你的意思是 现在的北极
You're telling me that the North Pole

1284
01:37:20,020 --> 01:37:22,000
跑到威斯康辛州附近了?
is now somewhere in Wisconsin?

1285
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:25,000
事实上 现在那里是南极
Actually, thats the South Pole now.

1286
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:31,400
快撑不住了

1287
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:33,400
出什么事了?

1288
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:35,960
引擎熄火 6个废了2个
Engine failure. 2 of 6 are down.

1289
01:37:35,990 --> 01:37:37,300
你们必须做好准备
You must get ready.

1290
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:42,340
- 还能撑多久? - 15分钟 运气好的话
- How long do we have? - 15 minutes. Maybe.

1291
01:37:44,090 --> 01:37:45,760
最好叫醒孩子们
Better wake up the kids.

1292
01:38:26,890 --> 01:38:28,220
你为什么讨厌戈登?
Why do you hate Gordon?

1293
01:38:32,930 --> 01:38:36,480
嘿 拜托
Hey. Come on.

1294
01:38:37,350 --> 01:38:41,690
你在说什么啊? 我不讨厌他
What are you talking about? I don't hate him.

1295
01:38:41,850 --> 01:38:43,610
反正你不喜欢他
You don't like him either

1296
01:38:43,690 --> 01:38:46,820
也许是因为我不了解他
That's because I don't know him well, maybe.

1297
01:38:46,950 --> 01:38:48,250
但我了解
But I do.

1298
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:50,620
一旦你了解他 就会知道他真的很好
He's really nice once you get to know him.

1299
01:38:50,660 --> 01:38:52,200
你该多和他聊聊
You should talk to him more often.

1300
01:38:52,300 --> 01:38:55,080
你们会相处得很好的
You guys would get along really well.

1301
01:38:58,290 --> 01:39:00,500
你真的很喜欢他 对吧?
You like him a lot, huh?

1302
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:12,260
我会尽力的 我保证 好吗?
I'll do my best. I promise. OK?

1303
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:17,140
我真的为你感到骄傲
I'm really proud of you. Really proud of you.

1304
01:39:18,690 --> 01:39:20,610
快到了吗?
Is it time?

1305
01:39:22,300 --> 01:39:23,100
是的
Yeah

1306
01:39:23,300 --> 01:39:26,320
- 快准备好 - 穿救生衣 亚力克

1307
01:39:26,950 --> 01:39:28,320
爹地 怎么了?
Dad, what's wrong?

1308
01:39:28,740 --> 01:39:31,600
萨沙说要降落了 会有点颠簸
Sasha's gotta land. It's gonna be a little bumpy.

1309
01:39:31,650 --> 01:39:32,910
可能还会有点滑
Maybe a little wet.

1310
01:39:33,950 --> 01:39:35,000
爹地?
Daddy?

1311
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:43,000
按住了
Hold her steady.

1312
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:03,200
爹地 我真的不太会游泳
Daddy, I'm not a really good swimmer.

1313
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:05,900
嘿 没关系 有救生衣呢
Hey, that's alright. It's what you got this for.

1314
01:40:06,700 --> 01:40:09,200
就像在家里的游泳池
It's like being in a swimming pool.

1315
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:12,990
只是装备更酷 有哨子 还有灯
Only it's got more cool stuff. It's got a whistle, a light.

1316
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:16,040
我以为我们要去中国
I thought we were going to China.

1317
01:40:16,830 --> 01:40:18,960
不 我们要在这里降落
No, we gotta land here.

1318
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:23,300
这就是我们要做的
So that's what we're gonna do.

1319
01:40:23,350 --> 01:40:24,600
我们要呆在一起 对吧?
We're just gonna all stay together. Right?

1320
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:26,300
不 我们都会死
No we're not, we're gonna die!

1321
01:40:26,250 --> 01:40:28,340
不 我们不会死
No, we're not.

1322
01:40:28,510 --> 01:40:29,930
保证吗?
Promise?

1323
01:40:30,050 --> 01:40:33,800
我向你们保证 不管发生什么 我们都会在一起
I promise you, we'll all stay together, no matter what happens.

1324
01:40:48,940 --> 01:40:51,610
杰克逊 尤里
Jackson, Yuri.

1325
01:40:53,740 --> 01:40:55,200
我想你们最好上来看看
I think you better come up here

1326
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:57,700
等等 我去看看就回来
Hold on, I'm gonna go check this out.

1327
01:40:57,800 --> 01:40:59,000
- 爹地 爹地 - 我马上回来
- Dad, Dad! - I'll be right back

1328
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,960
好了 嘿 系好安全带 快点
OK, hey, hey. We gotta buckle up. Let's go.

1329
01:41:04,210 --> 01:41:06,460
别问我怎么回事
Don't ask me how that happened.

1330
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:07,700
我们现在不在海上
There is no more ocean,

1331
01:41:07,900 --> 01:41:10,300
而且我们就要到目的地了
and we're pretty close to where we wanted to go.

1332
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:12,590
看来整个世界好像移动了1000英里
It's like the whole world shifted by 1000 miles.

1333
01:41:12,630 --> 01:41:15,390
准确的说是 1578英里
1578 to be exact.

1334
01:41:15,430 --> 01:41:17,770
这叫做"地壳漂移理论"
It's called "Earth Crust Displacement Theory"

1335
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:19,810
哈普古德教授在1958年提出的
Professor Hapgood 1958.

1336
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:22,800
真有你的 查理
Way to go, Charlie.

1337
01:41:25,940 --> 01:41:26,900
怎么了?
What was that?

1338
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:31,030
最后两个引擎也熄火了
We just lost our last two engines.

1339
01:41:49,670 --> 01:41:51,300
我要在下面紧急降落
I'll shoot for that glacier.

1340
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:52,630
会很颠簸
It's going to get rocky.

1341
01:41:52,670 --> 01:41:54,760
听好 这有些疯狂
Listen, it's gonna sound crazy,

1342
01:41:54,790 --> 01:41:56,850
但现在也只能这样做了
but here's what you have to do.

1343
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,350
都起来! 跟我来!
Get up! Follow me!

1344
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:06,560
尤里 我们要怎么做?
Yuri, what are you doing?

1345
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:09,000
我们要开宾特利了
We are taking the Bentley!

1346
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:12,820
等等! 还没到时候
Not yet! Not yet.

1347
01:42:14,860 --> 01:42:16,160
再等会儿
Almost there.

1348
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:18,370
快上车!
Get in the car.

1349
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,800
好了 开舱门! 快拉!
Okay, go now! Pull!

1350
01:42:42,430 --> 01:42:43,570
快走 杰克逊
Go, Jackson.

1351
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:45,480
我们要等萨沙和戈登
We gotta wait for Sasha and Gordon.

1352
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:50,500
快走! 确保所有人在着陆前都下飞机
Go! Make sure everybody gets off the plane before I touch down.

1353
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:51,780
那你呢?
What about you?

1354
01:42:51,820 --> 01:42:55,820
不用管我 我要保证飞机降落
I'll be fine. I have to touch this plane down.

1355
01:42:56,910 --> 01:42:59,900
你还等什么? 快走! 快!
What are you waiting for? Go!

1356
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:17,300
我看到他了 他来了
There he is. I see him!

1357
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:19,310
- 萨沙呢? - 快点 我们走
- Where is Sasha? - Come on let's go.

1358
01:43:19,340 --> 01:43:20,980
- 萨沙在哪儿? - 他说他会没事的
- Where is Sasha? - He said he's fine

1359
01:43:21,010 --> 01:43:23,200
在飞机着陆前我们要出去
We should get out of here before he touches down.

1360
01:43:23,300 --> 01:43:25,500
不 不 不 我们得等他!
No, no, no. Don't go! We should wait for him.

1361
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:27,850
杰克逊 快走
Go Jackson, go.

1362
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:30,900
没法启动
It won't start.

1363
01:43:32,270 --> 01:43:35,030
通通闭嘴!
Shut up everybody!

1364
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:38,360

启动
Start.

1366
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:46,330
声控的 很帅吧?
Voice control. Sold me on it.

1367
01:45:35,690 --> 01:45:38,190
下面 降落

1368
01:45:48,790 --> 01:45:51,790
欢迎来到中华人民共合国
Welcome, to the People's Republic of China.

1369
01:45:51,820 --> 01:45:53,790
很高兴能来 打招呼 孩子们
Good to be here. Say hi, kids.

1370
01:45:55,340 --> 01:45:58,550
- 你们的通行证是什么颜色? - 什么?
- What color are your passes? - What?

1371
01:45:58,600 --> 01:46:00,760
你们的登船通行证是什么颜色?
What color are your boarding passes?

1372
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:05,100
我有绿色的
I have green cards.

1373
01:46:05,690 --> 01:46:08,560
- 上面有我和我儿子的名字 - 什么?

1374
01:46:11,860 --> 01:46:13,820
尤里? 尤里!
Yuri? Yuri!

1375
01:46:14,700 --> 01:46:17,820
尤里 没搞错吧 你在开玩笑对吗?
Yuri. It's a mistake. A joke, right?

1376
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:23,870
怎么? 你以为我不知道你和萨沙的事?
What? You think I didn't know about you and Sasha?

1377
01:46:24,500 --> 01:46:28,670
愿上帝保佑那个混蛋的灵魂吧
May God bless that poor bastard's soul.

1378
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:37,380
各位 抱歉了 祝你们好运
I'm sorry guys. Good luck.

1379
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:39,680
走吧 孩子们
Come on, boys.

1380
01:46:41,140 --> 01:46:43,680
- 也许我们可以用钱贿赂他们 - 我有钱
- Maybe with money we could bribe them. - I do, I do.

1381
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:45,560
你有10亿欧元吗?
You got a billion Euros?

1382
01:46:49,900 --> 01:46:54,610
威尔逊博士 我是迈克尔斯上校 美国方舟的船长
Dr. Wilson. I'm Captain Michaels, Skipper of the American ship.

1383
01:46:54,650 --> 01:46:57,200
请接受我对您父亲最诚挚的哀悼
Please accept my sincere condolences for your father.

1384
01:46:57,230 --> 01:46:58,270
谢谢你 船长
Thank you, Captain.

1385
01:46:59,860 --> 01:47:03,150
安海斯先生 你们是最后到的
Mr. Anheuser. Your party is the last to arrive.

1386
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:09,580
船长 我们收到报告说方舟损坏严重
There's been reports of severe damage, Captain.

1387
01:47:09,610 --> 01:47:11,750
3号方舟的情况如何?
What's the status of Ark number 3?

1388
01:47:11,790 --> 01:47:13,830
全面评估尚未结束
We haven't done a complete assessment yet.

1389
01:47:13,860 --> 01:47:16,120
不过情况不容乐观
Looks like we lost it.

1390
01:47:25,780 --> 01:47:28,760
牙刷都不带 只带书
No toothbrush. Only books.

1391
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:32,390
小时候 我爸爸经常出差
When I was a kid my dad was on the road a lot.

1392
01:47:33,730 --> 01:47:35,900
他总是给我留一箱书
He'd always leave me a box full of books.

1393
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,730
每晚打电话监督我
Call me and cruise me.

1394
01:47:38,230 --> 01:47:41,770
每读完一本 我就可以得到一个冰淇淋蛋卷
I'd get an ice cream cone for every book I read so...

1395
01:47:41,810 --> 01:47:43,650
所以我小时候很胖
I was a fat kid.

1396
01:47:44,300 --> 01:47:46,800
真不敢相信
I find that very hard to believe.

1397
01:47:46,900 --> 01:47:50,900
是真的 我高中就读完了两千本书
No, its true, my high school carrier was 2000 books

1398
01:47:51,400 --> 01:47:53,200
一个女朋友没有
Zero girlfriends.

1399
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:57,000
我上大学前甚至都没亲过男孩子
I didn't even kiss a boy until I was in college.

1400
01:47:57,740 --> 01:48:00,000
他们都很怕我爸爸
They were all too scared of my dad.

1401
01:48:48,090 --> 01:48:49,800
把这个项目交给中国是正确的
Leave it to the Chinese.

1402
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,600
换作其他国家
I didn't think it was possible.

1403
01:48:51,700 --> 01:48:53,600
肯定无法完成
Not in the time we had.

1404
01:48:54,100 --> 01:48:56,100
那就是3号方舟 长官
That's Ark number 3, sir.

1405
01:48:56,470 --> 01:48:59,600
地壳移动时 顶棚坍塌了
The roof collapsed during the shifting of the Earth's crust.

1406
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,100
天啊
Jesus Christ.

1407
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:08,700
由于技术问题 3号方舟登船程序推迟
Boarding of Arc 3 will be delayed due to technical difficulties.

1408
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:13,660
嘿 到底怎么了?
Hey, what's going on here?

1409
01:49:13,700 --> 01:49:16,300
我和我的儿子都有绿卡
I have a green card for my boys and me.

1410
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:18,660
我要和你们的主管谈
I want to speak to your supervisor.

1411
01:49:18,700 --> 01:49:20,380
我就是主管
I am the supervisor.

1412
01:49:20,410 --> 01:49:23,500
回去跟其他拿绿卡的人一起排队 否则就拘留你
Get back with the other green cards, or I'll have you detained.

1413
01:49:25,750 --> 01:49:28,000
他说你和萨沙的事 是真的吗?
What he said about you and Sasha, is it true?

1414
01:49:28,100 --> 01:49:31,550
萨沙比尤里强100倍
Sasha was worth a hundred times a man like Yuri.

1415
01:49:31,700 --> 01:49:34,340
我早该听你的 西尔伯曼医生
I should have listened to you, Dr. Silberman.

1416
01:49:34,370 --> 01:49:39,500
其实我很喜欢我之前的样子 都是那个混蛋叫我去整形
I actually liked the way I looked before that monster talked me into it.

1417
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:41,890
他还叫我打折呢
Did you know he asked me for a discount?

1418
01:49:41,930 --> 01:49:43,940
而且是分期付款
He payed in installments.

1419
01:49:43,970 --> 01:49:45,400
吝啬的混蛋
Cheap bastard.

1420
01:49:46,110 --> 01:49:47,400
听到了吗?
You hear that?

1421
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:51,800
在那里!
Over there!

1422
01:49:55,160 --> 01:49:57,370
停车!
Stop!

1423
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,400
停车! 停车!
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1424
01:50:10,590 --> 01:50:12,510
停车 停车

1425
01:50:20,310 --> 01:50:24,310
直升机马上就要降落机坪 请做好准备

1426
01:50:39,410 --> 01:50:41,200
这些人是怎么选出来的?
How were all these people chosen?

1427
01:50:41,300 --> 01:50:42,900
跟你的艺术品一样
Same way your Arc was.

1428
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:44,000
由世界各地遗传专家来决定
By experts from all over the world.

1429
01:50:44,050 --> 01:50:47,000
我们需要需要保留下来的优秀基因
We had geneticists determine the perfect gene pool we need to repopulate.

1430
01:50:47,100 --> 01:50:48,790
这些人也是靠基因选出来的?
These people were chosen by geneticists?

1431
01:50:48,830 --> 01:50:52,600
所有的绿卡持有者 请到D4站台
All green card holders, please proceed to hangar D-4.

1432
01:50:52,670 --> 01:50:54,900
看来是支票让他们登船的
Looks to me like their check books got them on board.

1433
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:56,300
说的没错 威尔逊博士
That's right, Dr. Wilson.

1434
01:50:56,350 --> 01:50:58,300
没有私人巨额资金的支持
Without billions of dollars from the private sector

1435
01:50:58,350 --> 01:51:00,500
就没有这整个项目
this entire operation would've been impossible.

1436
01:51:00,650 --> 01:51:01,800
我们竟然还卖票?
We sold tickets?

1437
01:51:02,100 --> 01:51:03,900
那这些工人呢?
What about all these workers?

1438
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:05,900
他们能上船吗?
They all get passes?

1439
01:51:06,100 --> 01:51:10,300
想说什么? 人生不公平? 这就是你想说的?
What? Life isn't fair? Is that it?

1440
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:13,300
要是你想让这些中国工人上船
If you want to donate your passes to a couple of Chinese workers,

1441
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:15,100
你尽可以捐出你的通行证
you be my guest.

1442
01:51:15,700 --> 01:51:17,900
船长 我要一个出发前的简报
Captain, I want a pre-launch briefing.

1443
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:19,400
每个国家都要有
All international teams present.

1444
01:51:54,280 --> 01:51:56,150
搞什么鬼?
What the hell?

1445
01:51:59,370 --> 01:52:02,400
搞什么? 这里可以挤10个人!
What is this? They could've fit 10 people in here.

1446
01:52:07,660 --> 01:52:09,440
萨特南来电

1447
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:11,300
萨特南 你在哪儿?
Satnam, where are you?

1448
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:14,130
- 在南畔高原 - 什么?
- On the Nampan Plateau. - What?

1449
01:52:16,050 --> 01:52:18,510
海啸正在从东面过来
There's a tidal wave coming from the east.

1450
01:52:18,540 --> 01:52:19,720
巨大无比
It's gigantic.

1451
01:52:19,890 --> 01:52:21,300
萨特南 出什么事了?
Satnam, what happened?

1452
01:52:21,720 --> 01:52:23,600
没人来接我们 艾德里安
We never got picked up, Adrian.

1453
01:52:23,630 --> 01:52:25,850
飞机根本没来
The airlift never came.

1454
01:52:27,730 --> 01:52:29,190
永别了 我的朋友
Goodbye, my friend.

1455
01:52:30,270 --> 01:52:36,000
萨特南
Satnam

1456
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:01,590
- 玛丽 我们的设备在哪儿? - 在那边
- Mary, Mary, where are we set up? - Over there.

1457
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:09,300
- 给我印度南畔高原的卫星图像 - 好的 马上
- Give me the satellite images from Napam, India. - OK, right away.

1458
01:53:09,640 --> 01:53:10,400
怎么了?
What's happening?

1459
01:53:11,560 --> 01:53:15,800
萨特南说有另一股海啸 从东面过来
Satnam was talking about another wave, coming from the east.

1460
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:20,600
圣母玛利亚
Holy mother of God.

1461
01:53:20,780 --> 01:53:22,200
洪水会提前到来?
So the flooding will hit earlier?

1462
01:53:22,300 --> 01:53:24,950
你的意思是 第二股海啸就要来了?
You are telling me that the second wave is closer?

1463
01:53:24,990 --> 01:53:26,080
输入新的数据
Plug in the new data.

1464
01:53:27,910 --> 01:53:29,540
没有人去接萨特南!
Satnam didn't get picked up.

1465
01:53:29,570 --> 01:53:30,540
什么?
What?

1466
01:53:30,750 --> 01:53:33,380
现在这么乱 很多人都没法接
A lot of people didn't get picked up in this chaos.

1467
01:53:33,710 --> 01:53:35,760
这不是阴谋 赫尔姆斯利
This is not a conspiracy, Helmsley.

1468
01:53:35,790 --> 01:53:38,700
你的预测也不全都准确 对吧 博士?
Your predictions haven't exactly panned out, have they, Doctor?

1469
01:53:38,830 --> 01:53:41,130
准备好了
It's ready.

1470
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:45,100
天啊 1500米高
Oh God, its 1500 meters high.

1471
01:53:46,220 --> 01:53:47,680
还有多久会到这里?

1472
01:53:48,220 --> 01:53:49,350
告诉我 赫尔姆斯利 还有多久会到?
Talk to me, Hemsley, when will it hit?

1473
01:53:49,390 --> 01:53:51,000
打开倒计时
Adjust the countdown.

1474
01:54:07,450 --> 01:54:10,750
距离冲击时间还有28分10秒
28 minutes, 10 seconds to impact.

1475
01:54:10,780 --> 01:54:11,580
天啊
My God.

1476
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,000
船长

1477
01:54:13,300 --> 01:54:15,500
我要立刻和其他国家的元首谈谈
I need to speak to the other heads of state immediately.

1478
01:54:15,550 --> 01:54:17,220
- 马上 泰勒? - 是 船长
- Right away. Taylor? - Aye, Captain

This is Carl Anheuser acting CIC on 4,

1481
01:54:23,550 --> 01:54:24,150

请求召开T-99紧急会议

1483

1484
01:54:51,750 --> 01:54:53,400
他是个好孩子

1485
01:54:54,460 --> 01:54:55,580

1487
01:55:10,010 --> 01:55:11,720
你很幸运 杰克逊
You're a lucky man, Jackson.

1488
01:55:13,140 --> 01:55:14,520
你一定要记住
Don't ever forget it.

1489
01:55:30,910 --> 01:55:31,990
他们是谁?

1490
01:55:32,450 --> 01:55:34,200
我们在路上遇到的

1491
01:55:34,240 --> 01:55:36,100
送他们回去!

1492
01:55:42,050 --> 01:55:46,500
我是大喇嘛仁波切的弟子

1493
01:55:46,900 --> 01:55:48,500
你知道我不能这么做

1494
01:55:50,350 --> 01:55:51,800
你不用带我们所有人走
You don't have to take all of us.

1495
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:54,300
只要带上我的孩子就行 求求你了
Please just take my children. I'm begging you.

1496
01:55:54,770 --> 01:55:56,360
我为什么要这么做?
Why should I do that?

1497
01:55:56,390 --> 01:56:00,600
你不也想救你的家人吗? 求你了!
Same reason you sent for your family. Please!

1498
01:56:00,900 --> 01:56:03,480
请带上孩子 不用管我们
Please just the children, you don't have to take us.

1499
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:04,490
求你了!
Please!

1500
01:56:07,240 --> 01:56:10,570
求你了 上帝啊!
Please. Oh my God.

1501
01:56:13,240 --> 01:56:17,080
求你了 我不知道你是否听得懂
Please. I don't know if you can understand what I'm saying.

1502
01:56:17,120 --> 01:56:19,750
但我们都是母亲 求你了
As a mother, I'm begging you.

1503
01:56:19,790 --> 01:56:21,250
带上孩子吧
Please take them.

1504
01:56:22,590 --> 01:56:23,590
求你了
Please.

1505
01:56:23,900 --> 01:56:29,430
丹增 我们都是大地的子女

1506
01:56:30,260 --> 01:56:33,720
奶奶 人太多 计划就行不通了

1507
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:37,000
带他们所有人一起走

1508
01:56:37,200 --> 01:56:38,500
带上他们

1509
01:56:48,820 --> 01:56:50,660
所有建筑工人马上撤离

1510
01:56:50,700 --> 01:56:52,490
所有工作人员做好准备

1511
01:56:52,830 --> 01:56:57,040
请所有建筑工人马上撤离

1512
01:56:57,080 --> 01:56:59,420
所有机组人员马上登船

1513
01:56:59,750 --> 01:57:01,600
他们把门打开了
They're opening the mountain.

1514
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:04,500
他们要弃我们而去
They are leaving without us.

1515
01:57:06,170 --> 01:57:07,930
退后 你听见没有!
Get back. What did I tell you!

1516
01:57:07,970 --> 01:57:11,600
他们也要把你丢下了 看 傻瓜!
They are leaving you behind too. Look, idiot.

1517
01:57:25,480 --> 01:57:27,400
跟我来
Follow me.

1518
01:57:34,120 --> 01:57:37,000
我们得快点 他们要走了

1519
01:57:39,710 --> 01:57:42,170
启动安全程序
Initiating security procedures.

1520
01:57:47,550 --> 01:57:50,260
打扰下 艾德里安・赫尔姆斯利在哪儿?
Excuse me. Where can I find Adrian Helmsley?

1521
01:57:50,290 --> 01:57:51,630
在船上 跟我来
He's on the bridge. This way.

1522
01:57:55,890 --> 01:57:57,100
丹增 等等

1523
01:57:58,520 --> 01:58:00,520
奶奶 我们就快到了

1524
01:58:00,730 --> 01:58:02,670
压力正常吗 安东?
Green lights on pressure, Mr. Anton?

1525
01:58:02,700 --> 01:58:04,610
一切正常 船长
Green lights across the board, Captain.

1526
01:58:16,740 --> 01:58:17,950
为什么会有锚?
Why do they have anchors?

1527
01:58:17,990 --> 01:58:21,160
因为这不是太空船 是方舟
Because they're not space ships. They're Arcs.

1528
01:58:21,620 --> 01:58:22,790
快走吧
Let's go.

1529
01:58:35,220 --> 01:58:36,640
总统先生
Mr. President.

1530
01:58:37,680 --> 01:58:38,680
看看这个
You've got to see this.

1531
01:59:19,970 --> 01:59:21,520
启动加固装置
Engage the support mechanisms.

1532
01:59:21,560 --> 01:59:23,600
是 船长 启动加固装置
Aye-aye, Captain. Engaging supports.

1533
01:59:23,700 --> 01:59:25,480
这些支架大概能
Just exactly how long are these things

1534
01:59:25,530 --> 01:59:27,100
支持我们多久 船长?
expected to hold us in place, Captain?

1535
01:59:27,140 --> 01:59:30,900
它们只能抵抗第一波海啸的冲击 安海斯先生
They're just meant to withstand the first impact of the waves, Mr. Anheuser.

1536
01:59:48,210 --> 01:59:51,170
下去 奥列格 你先走
Down there Oleg, you go first.

1537
01:59:56,470 --> 01:59:57,720
凯撒
Caesar!

1538
02:00:04,350 --> 02:00:05,270
凯撒
Caesar!

1539
02:00:14,780 --> 02:00:16,700
凯撒 非常好!

1540
02:00:18,490 --> 02:00:21,910
好孩子 到妈妈这来
Good, good boy. Come to Mommy.

1541
02:00:21,940 --> 02:00:22,990
凯撒!
Caesar!

1542
02:00:23,740 --> 02:00:25,910
妈咪 塔玛拉呢?
Mommy, where's Tamara?

1543
02:00:28,210 --> 02:00:29,960
爸爸 快看!

1544
02:00:32,840 --> 02:00:34,590
- 塔玛拉 - 马上就来
- Tamara! - I'm coming.

1545
02:00:43,010 --> 02:00:44,010
接住!
Take it!

1546
02:01:11,080 --> 02:01:13,600
上帝啊 外面怎么回事?
Oh my god, what's happening out there?

1547
02:01:15,420 --> 02:01:18,670
安海斯说服了各国元首 马上启航
Anheuser convinced the other heads of state to launch.

1548
02:01:22,010 --> 02:01:23,500
安霍伊泽先生
Mr. Anheuser

1549
02:01:25,390 --> 02:01:27,390
必须停止外面的悲剧
We have to stop this madness.

1550
02:01:28,230 --> 02:01:30,230
让其它船都能看到我
Make sure the other bridges can see me.

1551
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:31,700
你要干什么?
What do you think you're doing?

1552
02:01:31,800 --> 02:01:33,100
我知道我要干什么 打开吧
I know exactly what I'm doing. Turn it on.

1553
02:01:35,770 --> 02:01:37,860
女士们先生们 我是艾德里安・赫尔姆斯利博士
Ladies and Gentleman, this is Dr. Adrian Helmsley

1554
02:01:37,900 --> 02:01:41,070
已故总统威尔逊的首席科学顾问
Chief science adviser to the late President Wilson.

1555
02:01:41,160 --> 02:01:43,500
把声音开大点 霍夫曼先生
Could you please turn up the volume, Mr. Hoffman.

1556
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,500
我知道为了保存人类的文明
I know we've all been forced to make difficult decisions

1557
02:01:46,550 --> 02:01:48,300
我们必须做出困难的抉择
to save our human civilization.

1558
02:01:48,300 --> 02:01:51,330
但作为人类 就意味着要相互关心
But to be human means to care for each other

1559
02:01:51,370 --> 02:01:55,500
所谓文明 就是要共同去创造更美好的生活
and civilization means to work together to create a better life.

1560
02:01:55,590 --> 02:01:57,890
如果是这样 那我们此时的行为
If that's true, then there's nothing human

1561
02:01:57,920 --> 02:02:01,010
就没有一丝人性和文明可言
and nothing civilized about what we're doing here.

1562
02:02:01,040 --> 02:02:03,590
赫尔姆斯利博士的热情令人钦佩
Dr. Helmsley's passion is admirable,

1563
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:05,100
但我不得不提醒大家
But I remind you that

1564
02:02:05,200 --> 02:02:08,190
我们的资源有限 而且时间紧迫
we have very limited resources and extremely limited time.

1565
02:02:08,220 --> 02:02:12,800
扪心自问 我们能袖手旁观 看着这些人去死吗?
Ask yourselves, can we really stand by and watch these people die?

1566
02:02:13,650 --> 02:02:15,730
两天前我读到一句话
I read a quote two days ago.

1567
02:02:15,860 --> 02:02:18,150
作者现在可能已经死了 但他说
The author is probably dead by now. But he said:

1568
02:02:18,190 --> 02:02:21,130
"等到我们不再为他人而战时"
"The moment we stop fighting for each other"

1569
02:02:21,160 --> 02:02:24,070
"我们也就失去了人性"
"That's the moment that we lose our humanity."

1570
02:02:24,200 --> 02:02:25,370
为了拯救人类
And in order to save the human race,

1571
02:02:25,410 --> 02:02:28,040
我们制定了这个计划 并遵守着
we have and obligation to stick to this plan

1572
02:02:28,080 --> 02:02:31,290
这里的各国元首都签字同意了
which every nation on this flotilla signed up for.

1573
02:02:31,320 --> 02:02:33,750
他们现在只能听天由命!
They're in God's hands now.

1574
02:02:35,630 --> 02:02:38,130
军官 你把它关掉
Officer, you turn that off.

1575
02:02:39,130 --> 02:02:40,340
这是命令 关掉!
That is an order, sailor. Turn it off!

1576
02:02:40,380 --> 02:02:42,130
你敢关掉试试 年轻人!
Don't you dare touch that button, young man!

1577
02:02:42,170 --> 02:02:45,050
你们通通都疯了吗?
Have you completely lost your mind?

1578
02:02:45,390 --> 02:02:46,350
看看时间
Look at the clock!

1579
02:02:46,550 --> 02:02:49,100
我们只有可怜的15分钟了!
We have barely 15 minutes left!

1580
02:02:49,390 --> 02:02:51,700
你能为人类的灭绝负责吗?
Do you want to be responsible for the extinction of the human race?

1581
02:02:51,760 --> 02:02:53,270
你能负责吗 艾德里安?
Can you handle that, Adrian?

1582
02:02:53,980 --> 02:02:55,900
有一位年轻的印度天体物理学家
There's a young astrophysicist from India

1583
02:02:55,950 --> 02:02:57,700
我们能在这儿都是他的功劳
who's the reason we are all here.

1584
02:02:57,750 --> 02:02:59,000
噢 得了吧
Oh, for God's sake.

1585
02:02:59,320 --> 02:03:01,830
是他发现了这一切
He's the one who discovered it all.

1586
02:03:01,860 --> 02:03:05,200
是他把所有线索连在一起 是他救了我们所有人
He connected all the dots, we all owe him our lives.

1587
02:03:05,700 --> 02:03:06,500
我刚刚得知
I just learned that

1588
02:03:06,550 --> 02:03:10,800
他和他的家人在印度东部发生的海啸中丧生
he was killed with his family in a Tsunami in eastern India.

1589
02:03:12,710 --> 02:03:14,500
他是我的好朋友
He was my friend.

1590
02:03:15,580 --> 02:03:17,500
他就这样白白的死了
And he died in vain.

1591
02:03:18,290 --> 02:03:21,420
那里的所有人都白死了
Everybody out there has died in vain.

1592
02:03:21,590 --> 02:03:25,200
如果我们用如此残酷的方式开创未来
If we start our future with an act of cruelty,

1593
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:29,500
我们怎么向孩子交代?
what will you tell your children?

1594
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:32,400
他们又怎么向下一代交代?
What will they tell theirs?

1595
02:03:34,890 --> 02:03:38,940
如果我父亲在这里 他不会袖手旁观
If my father were here, he would open the gates.

1596
02:03:45,700 --> 02:03:48,320
俄罗斯人民以及
The people of Russia along with,

1597
02:03:49,370 --> 02:03:50,700
中国
China

1598
02:03:52,540 --> 02:03:54,370

1599
02:03:54,410 --> 02:03:55,370
同意
Agree

1600
02:03:56,750 --> 02:03:59,080
把门打开!
To open the gates!

1601
02:04:00,540 --> 02:04:04,970
英国 西班牙 法国 加拿大 德国
The United Kingdom, Spain, France, Canada, Germany,

1602
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:09,300
我想我也可以代表意大利总理
and I believe I may also speak for the Italian Prime Minister,

1603
02:04:09,680 --> 02:04:13,000
我们赞成让这些人进来
We vote to let these people come in.

1604
02:04:18,480 --> 02:04:20,300
迈克尔斯船长
Captain Michaels.

1605
02:04:21,770 --> 02:04:23,600
请开门
Please

1606
02:04:26,780 --> 02:04:28,370
我是船长
This is your Captain.

1607
02:04:28,410 --> 02:04:31,700
请稍候 我们将打开大门
In a few moments, we will open the gates.

1608
02:04:39,210 --> 02:04:41,960
好臭啊
Phew, it stinks.

1609
02:05:00,480 --> 02:05:02,900
- 他们正在开门 - 快! 快!
- They are opening the gate. - Go! Go!

1610
02:05:02,930 --> 02:05:04,860
诺亚 快点!
Noah. Move it!

1611
02:05:05,400 --> 02:05:07,600
诺亚! 诺亚!
Noah! Noah!

1612
02:05:18,870 --> 02:05:20,960
妈妈 出事了
Mom, something happened.

1613
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:22,000

02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:26,130
坚持住!
Hold on!

1615
02:05:28,670 --> 02:05:31,220
戈登 抓紧 他妈的! 把手给我!
Gordon, hold on. God damn it! Give me your hand! Give me your hand!

1616
02:05:31,250 --> 02:05:32,400
- 把手给我! - 救我!
- Reach for it! - Help me!

1617
02:05:32,500 --> 02:05:33,000
拉住我的手
Reach for it!

1618
02:05:37,640 --> 02:05:39,730
戈登!
Gordon!

1619
02:05:48,150 --> 02:05:49,700
快爬上去 快爬!

1620
02:06:23,480 --> 02:06:24,770
门怎么了?
What's wrong with the gate?

1621
02:06:25,110 --> 02:06:27,500
好像是门没有完全打开 我们正在检查
Looks like it didn't run the full cycle. We're checking it out.

1622
02:06:36,370 --> 02:06:39,000
距离冲击还有四分钟
4 minutes to impact.

1623
02:07:24,920 --> 02:07:28,040
- 我们满载了 船长 - 那就关门 马上!
- We're all loaded, Captain. - Then let's lock it up. Now!

1624
02:07:38,010 --> 02:07:41,390
奥列格 抓住我的手
Oleg! Grab my hand!

1625
02:07:41,430 --> 02:07:42,680
奥列格
Oleg!

1626
02:08:13,200 --> 02:08:15,200
有东西卡住了液压装置 船长
Something's jamming the hydraulics, Captain.

1627
02:08:15,270 --> 02:08:16,500
看在上帝的份上 快把故障排除
Well then get it out for Christ sake.

1628
02:08:16,550 --> 02:08:19,300
门不关上我们就没法启动引擎
I can't fire up the engines until we get a good seal on that gate.

1629
02:08:20,050 --> 02:08:22,470
船长 有人闯入动物区
Captain, we have a breach in the zoological bay.

1630
02:08:22,640 --> 02:08:24,770
- 可以放大吗? - 可以
- Can you zoom in? - Yeah.

1631
02:08:28,600 --> 02:08:30,100
我认识那几个孩子
I know those kids.

1632
02:08:30,150 --> 02:08:32,480
怎么回事? 到底发生了什么?
What is happening? What's going on?

1633
02:08:32,730 --> 02:08:34,200
他们从哪儿进来的?
Where did they come from?

1634
02:08:36,450 --> 02:08:38,450
在那里 从液压舱进来的
There. Through the hydraulic chamber.

1635
02:08:38,570 --> 02:08:39,910
船长 找到故障原因了
Captain, I think we found the problem!

1636
02:08:39,940 --> 02:08:42,490
- 他们是谁? - 等等!
- Who are these people? - No, wait!

1637
02:08:42,910 --> 02:08:43,740
那个人受伤了
He's injured.

1638
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:45,000
可能出事了
Something must've gone wrong.

1639
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,800
可能出事了? 可能...
Something must've gone wrong? Something must've gone...

1640
02:08:47,870 --> 02:08:50,400
你在开玩笑吗? 当然出事了!
Are you kidding me? Of course something went wrong!

1641
02:08:50,500 --> 02:08:52,500
应该恭喜你们俩
You know, congratulations to the both of you.

1642
02:08:52,600 --> 02:08:53,600
把我们全害死也没关系
Might have gotten us all killed,

1643
02:08:53,650 --> 02:08:56,260
只要你问心无愧 对吧 赫尔姆斯利?
but as long as your conscience is clean, right Helmsley?

1644
02:08:56,290 --> 02:08:58,170
船长 派紧急救援小队下去
Captain, get an emergency team down there,

1645
02:08:58,210 --> 02:08:59,600
我会在液压舱和他们会合
I'll meet them at the hydraulics chamber.

1646
02:08:59,700 --> 02:09:01,000
- 你知道怎么走吗? - 知道
- You know your way around here? - Yeah

1647
02:09:01,050 --> 02:09:02,200
我们走
Let's go!

1648
02:09:02,250 --> 02:09:04,300
距离冲击还有一分钟
1 minute to impact.

1649
02:09:18,030 --> 02:09:18,780
船长?
Captain?

1650
02:09:19,280 --> 02:09:21,000
卓明谷机场已经被摧毁
Cho Ming airfield has been hit.

1651
02:09:21,620 --> 02:09:25,660
- 启动紧急通讯系统 泰勒 - 可以了 船长
- Put me on emergency comm, Mr. Taylor. - You're on it, Captain.

1652
02:09:26,160 --> 02:09:28,370
大家注意 我是船长
This is the Captain speaking

1653
02:09:28,410 --> 02:09:31,210
我们马上就会遭到洪水冲击
We expect to be impacted by water shortly.

1654
02:09:31,420 --> 02:09:32,280
我们得走这里
We need to go this way.

1655
02:09:54,150 --> 02:09:57,400
所有控制台准备接受冲击
All stations prepare for impact.

1656
02:10:43,030 --> 02:10:45,500
冲击压力逼近80帕
Impact pressure just climbed 80 Pascal.

1657
02:10:45,530 --> 02:10:48,300
表面传感器受到0.2密尔的表面压力
Surface compression of valve sensors, Captain.

1658
02:10:48,350 --> 02:10:50,000
我找到赫尔姆斯利博士了
I tracked Dr. Helmsley.

1659
02:10:50,870 --> 02:10:51,250
在那儿
There!

1660
02:10:55,670 --> 02:10:58,590
让开! 让一下! 让一下!
Out of the way! Excuse me. Excuse me.

1661
02:10:59,340 --> 02:11:01,630
丹增 快到了

1662
02:11:02,340 --> 02:11:04,050
尼玛 怎么了?

1663
02:11:06,140 --> 02:11:07,060
塔玛拉!
Tamara!

1664
02:11:07,100 --> 02:11:09,520
把孩子们带过去
Will you take the kids please?

1665
02:11:09,850 --> 02:11:11,020
怎么走?
Which way?

1666
02:11:11,180 --> 02:11:15,200
我们过不去 船尾进水了
We can't get there! Water is entering the stern.

1667
02:11:15,500 --> 02:11:19,200
船后面淹掉后 会自动开始逐舱封闭
The rear of this ship is flooded and will seal up one compartment at a time.

1668
02:11:19,650 --> 02:11:21,150
戈登呢?
Where's Gordon?

1669
02:11:22,490 --> 02:11:23,530
不
No?

1670
02:11:25,570 --> 02:11:27,550
我们得回去
We gotta go back!

1671
02:11:27,590 --> 02:11:29,540
我们必须回去
We have to go back!

1672
02:11:33,080 --> 02:11:34,330
妈咪
Mommy!

1673
02:11:35,290 --> 02:11:36,790
- 救命! - 妈咪!
- Help! - Mommy!

1674
02:11:45,680 --> 02:11:47,000
快爬过去 莉莉
Go over, Lilly!

1675
02:11:50,220 --> 02:11:52,680
凯撒! 莉莉 带上它!
Caesar! Lilly, take him!

1676
02:11:54,850 --> 02:11:57,020
妈咪!
Mommy!

1677
02:12:03,990 --> 02:12:06,360
还有别的路到液压舱吗?
Is there another way to the hydraulics chamber?

1678
02:12:06,570 --> 02:12:07,530
这梯子通到哪儿?
Where does this ladder go?

1679
02:12:07,570 --> 02:12:10,660
- 通向动物区 - 好 快走!
- To the zoological bay. - Okay, let's go!

1680
02:12:16,540 --> 02:12:20,090
教授 那是空军一号
Professor? It's Air Force One.

1681
02:12:37,230 --> 02:12:39,060
中锚被击中了
The mid-ship anchor support is hit.

1682
02:12:39,150 --> 02:12:40,590
可以加固吗?
Can you stabilize it?

1683
02:12:40,620 --> 02:12:42,020
尾锚也不行了
The bow anchor is giving in.

1684
02:13:01,500 --> 02:13:03,400
船长 涡轮没有反应
Captain, the turbines aren't responding.

1685
02:13:03,500 --> 02:13:06,300
跳过这个 手动发动引擎
So override it. Hit the override. Start the engine.

1686
02:13:06,350 --> 02:13:08,600
门没关好就发动不了引擎
We can't start the engine until we close that gate.

1687
02:13:26,820 --> 02:13:29,320
救我 救命啊!
Help me! Help!

1688
02:13:34,200 --> 02:13:38,000
妈妈! 妈妈!
Momma! Momma!

1689
02:13:38,620 --> 02:13:41,500
- 你没事吧? - 我妈咪在那里面 救救她!
- Are you OK? - My mommy is in there. Please help her!

1690
02:13:41,460 --> 02:13:42,790
我们会去救你妈咪的 宝贝
We'll get to your mommy, sweetheart.

1691
02:13:42,830 --> 02:13:44,130
我们会尽全力的 好吗?
They're doing everything they can, okay?

1692
02:13:44,160 --> 02:13:45,300
能和她说话吗?
Can we talk to her?

1693
02:13:45,340 --> 02:13:47,380
我试试看
I'm gonna try to connect us.

1694
02:13:47,420 --> 02:13:48,970
我们要先给他止血!
We have to stop the bleeding!

1695
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:50,180
用我的皮带
How about my belt?

1696
02:13:50,380 --> 02:13:53,350
柯蒂斯先生? 杰克逊?
Mr. Curtis? Jackson?

1697
02:13:54,680 --> 02:13:56,650
救命! 嘿!
Help! Hey!

1698
02:13:56,680 --> 02:13:58,500
我是艾德里安・赫尔姆斯利 我们在黄石公园见过
It's Adrian Helmsley, we met at Yellowstone.

1699
02:13:58,550 --> 02:14:01,500
太好了 快点把这该死的门打开!
Thats great. Open the God damn door!

1700
02:14:01,600 --> 02:14:03,610
你女儿在我这边!
Your daughter is with me!

1701
02:14:03,650 --> 02:14:06,860
- 莉莉? - 诺亚在哪儿?
- Lilly? - Where's Noah?

1702
02:14:06,900 --> 02:14:08,740
我就在这儿 莉莉
I'm right here, Lil!

1703
02:14:08,770 --> 02:14:10,700
冲击警告!
Impact warning!

1704
02:14:10,740 --> 02:14:14,370
30度以西 45度以东
30°West, 45°East.

1705
02:14:14,410 --> 02:14:18,210
目标高度29035英尺(约8850米)
Target elevation 29,035 feet.

1706
02:14:18,250 --> 02:14:21,500
两万九千英尺? 什么意思?
29,000 feet? What the hell is at 29.000 feet?

1707
02:14:21,540 --> 02:14:25,900
正前方就是珠穆朗玛峰北侧 安海斯先生
We're headed straight for the north face of Mount Everest, Mr. Anheuser.

1708
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,090
如果还不能发动引擎
And if we can't start our engines,

1709
02:14:28,120 --> 02:14:30,170
我们就只能等死了
we will not survive the impact.

1710
02:14:40,350 --> 02:14:43,560
杰克逊 舱门封住了 我们过不去
Jackson, you're sealed off! We can't get to you!

1711
02:14:43,600 --> 02:14:45,450
有东西卡住了液压装置
There's something blocking the hydraulics

1712
02:14:45,480 --> 02:14:48,190
如果不弄出来 我们都死定了
If you can't get it out, none of us are gonna make it

1713
02:14:49,280 --> 02:14:51,700
赫尔姆斯利博士 看这个
Dr. Helmsley, look at this.

1714
02:14:52,320 --> 02:14:53,900
下面全都淹没了
It's completely submerged down there

1715
02:14:53,950 --> 02:14:56,200
根本进不去 无法呼吸
and there's no way for them to get any air.

1716
02:14:56,270 --> 02:14:57,420
没别的办法了!
There is no other way!

1717
02:14:57,450 --> 02:14:59,830
但这是去送死 先生!
But it's a suicide mission, sir!

1718
02:15:07,090 --> 02:15:09,630
我知道卡在哪里 我去试试
I know where it is, I'll give it a try.

1719
02:15:16,050 --> 02:15:18,640
爸爸 等等 我要和你一起去!
Dad, wait, I wanna go with you!

1720
02:15:18,720 --> 02:15:21,120
- 不不不 - 爸爸我想帮你

1722
02:15:23,560 --> 02:15:25,400
还记得莉莉出生的时候
Remember when Lilly was born

1723
02:15:25,460 --> 02:15:27,600
你想当她哥哥吗?
and you wanted to be introduced as her big brother?

1724
02:15:28,360 --> 02:15:30,050
她现在很害怕
Well, she's scared now.

1725
02:15:30,080 --> 02:15:31,700
非常需要你
She needs you more than ever.

1726
02:15:31,740 --> 02:15:35,030
如果你安全 我就知道她也安全 明白吗?
If you're safe, I know that she's safe. Do you understand?

1727
02:15:41,540 --> 02:15:43,660
你可以下次再帮我
You can help me out the next time.

1728
02:15:46,540 --> 02:15:48,540
是我们把它卡住了
We caused this thing, it was us.

1729
02:15:48,580 --> 02:15:50,420
我得去搞定它
I gotta go check it out.

1730
02:16:03,640 --> 02:16:05,100
我爱你!
I love you!

1731
02:16:13,360 --> 02:16:16,570
丹增! 他不行了! 他不行了!

1732
02:16:20,660 --> 02:16:22,450
有人能听到我说话吗?
Can you hear me?

1733
02:16:26,360 --> 02:16:27,620
救命!
Help!

1737
02:17:24,890 --> 02:17:27,000

1740
02:17:40,280 --> 02:17:41,950
船长 有影像了
Captain! We have a visual!

1741
02:17:41,990 --> 02:17:43,870
我们找到问题了
I think we found the problem.

1742
02:17:43,900 --> 02:17:45,740
切换到液压舱
Show us the hydraulics chamber

1743
02:18:03,010 --> 02:18:05,060
搞什么! 不是叫你留在上面吗!
God damn it! I told you to stay up there!

1744
02:18:05,090 --> 02:18:06,500
我只是想来帮你
I just wanted to help.

1745
02:18:06,800 --> 02:18:09,730
好吧 没事 你拿着手电筒
Alright, alright. You hold the light.

1746
02:18:09,770 --> 02:18:12,000
我们正在低压区 知道吗?
We're right under the air pocket, okay?

1747
02:18:12,640 --> 02:18:14,400
我还真的需要你帮忙
How did you know I needed help?

1748
02:18:19,360 --> 02:18:22,950
爷爷 奶奶 对不起

1749
02:18:22,990 --> 02:18:24,120
我救不了你们了

1750
02:18:24,490 --> 02:18:27,950
他会回来的 他会修好的

1751
02:18:28,250 --> 02:18:31,000
不可能的

1752
02:18:31,540 --> 02:18:34,040
不要灰心 哥哥

1753
02:19:01,820 --> 02:19:03,000
爸爸!
Dad!

1754
02:19:09,500 --> 02:19:12,210
没信号了 我们死定了
We lost him. We're gonna die!

1755
02:19:34,440 --> 02:19:37,560
干得好 照着那儿 我去拔电缆
Great job! You light the way and I'll go for the cable.

1756
02:19:38,770 --> 02:19:41,650
距离撞击400米
Distance to impact: 400 meters

1757
02:19:41,690 --> 02:19:42,870
前面有山脊!
Underwater ridge ahead!

1758
02:19:42,900 --> 02:19:44,320
我们要搁浅了 船长
We're going to run aground, Captain!

1759
02:20:14,690 --> 02:20:16,190
长官 门关上了
Sir, the gate is sealed!

1760
02:20:16,220 --> 02:20:17,650
确认了 船长!
That's affirmative, Captain!

1761
02:20:17,690 --> 02:20:21,780
- 安东 启动引擎 - 是 船长 全速后退
- Anton, start the engines. - Aye-aye Captain. Full reverse.

1762
02:20:29,490 --> 02:20:31,740
停不下来 船长 还是不行

1768
02:21:22,340 --> 02:21:24,760
左满舵
Hard to port!

1769
02:21:35,850 --> 02:21:38,310
成功了! 我们成功了!
We did it! We did it!

1770
02:21:38,940 --> 02:21:41,400
- 爸爸呢? - 就在我后面
- Where's Dad? - He was right behind me

1771
02:21:42,860 --> 02:21:45,070
液压舱有消息吗?
Any word from the hydraulic chamber?

1772
02:21:45,100 --> 02:21:45,870
他在哪儿?
Where is he?

1773
02:21:45,900 --> 02:21:47,650
你不是说他在你后面吗?
I thought you said he was right behind you.

1774
02:21:47,690 --> 02:21:48,330
是啊
He was!

1775
02:21:48,360 --> 02:21:50,280
- 你确定吗? - 没错
- Are you sure? - Yes.

1776

1777
02:22:00,690 --> 02:22:04,120
爸爸 爸爸!
Dad. Dad!

1778
02:22:04,150 --> 02:22:06,860
快点 杰克逊 出来啊

1782
02:22:36,850 --> 02:22:38,230
他成功了
He did it!

1783
02:23:22,460 --> 02:23:29,840
0001年1月27日

1784
02:23:36,390 --> 02:23:39,310
亚特兰蒂斯号太空船 我们的最后一天
Shuttle Atlantis. Our last day.

1785
02:23:39,350 --> 02:23:42,890
我们只能听到彼此的呼吸
All we can hear is the sound of our own breathing.

1786
02:23:42,930 --> 02:23:48,400
我们还在分享着共同的回忆 希望 和想法
That reminds us we are still sharing our memories, hopes and ideas.

1787
02:23:48,440 --> 02:23:51,990
有趣的是 直到今天早上我们才知道
And isn't it funny? Just this morning we worked it out

1788
02:23:52,020 --> 02:23:57,200
或多或少 我们在威斯康辛州都有亲戚
Somehow or another, we all have relatives in Wisconsin.

1789
02:23:59,580 --> 02:24:01,040
结束
The end.

1790
02:24:10,920 --> 02:24:12,170
真不错
It's good.

1791
02:24:13,050 --> 02:24:14,720
我就知道你会喜欢
I thought you would like it.

1792
02:24:16,680 --> 02:24:21,200
告诉我 威尔逊博士 除了书籍和艺术
Tell me Dr. Wilson, apart from books and art.

1793
02:24:22,470 --> 02:24:25,500
我们还有什么能分享的你觉得
Do you think there's anything else we might possibly share?

1794
02:24:26,400 --> 02:24:28,150
在未来
In the future?

1795
02:24:29,060 --> 02:24:32,800
赫尔姆斯利博士 你是在约我吗?
Are you asking me out on a date, Dr. Helmsley?

1796
02:24:33,440 --> 02:24:36,320
你知道我的行程都很紧凑的
You know my diary is pretty full.

1797
02:24:37,870 --> 02:24:39,450
事实上
Actually.

1798
02:24:41,950 --> 02:24:43,700
对 我是在约你
Yes, I was.

1799
02:24:48,170 --> 02:24:50,750
赫尔姆斯利博士请到控制舱
Dr. Helmsley to the bridge, please.

1800
02:24:50,790 --> 02:24:53,090
赫尔姆斯利博士请到控制舱
Dr. Helmsley to the bridge.

1801
02:24:55,300 --> 02:24:56,760
过来
Come here.

1802
02:25:03,220 --> 02:25:05,730
女士们先生们 我是迈克尔斯船长
Ladies and gentleman, this is captain Michaels speaking.

1803
02:25:05,760 --> 02:25:09,810
等一下 我将下令开启甲板
In a few minutes I will give orders to unseal the decks.

1804
02:25:11,020 --> 02:25:18,000
昨晚11点45分 6号和7号方舟和我们汇合了
At 23:45 last night, our sister Arks 6 and 7 have joined our course.

1805
02:25:18,610 --> 02:25:21,500
我们的旅程第一次出现了晴天 空气清澈
For the first time on our journey, we will have clear skies.

1806
02:25:23,620 --> 02:25:27,100
众所周知 我们的船严重超载
As you know our passenger count is way over capacity.

1807
02:25:27,330 --> 02:25:30,310
所以 请大家走上甲板时 格外小心
So please, be careful when you step out,

1808
02:25:30,350 --> 02:25:33,300
当然 好好享受新鲜空气吧
and of course, enjoy the fresh air.

1809
02:25:36,090 --> 02:25:37,510
我可以抱它吗?
Can I hold him?

1810
02:25:37,550 --> 02:25:40,760
当然 要是你喜欢 它也是你的
Sure, he can be your dog too if you like.

1811
02:25:40,800 --> 02:25:42,050
谢谢
Thanks.

1812
02:25:45,930 --> 02:25:47,430
我的真命天子 你去哪了?
Where have you been all my life?

1813
02:25:47,480 --> 02:25:48,980
去买礼物了
Gift shop.

1814
02:26:46,200 --> 02:26:48,540
嘿 艾德里安 好消息
Oh, Adrian. Excellent.

1815
02:26:48,580 --> 02:26:51,300
我们终于收到了卫星影像资料
I called because we just got our first satellite feet.

1816
02:26:51,500 --> 02:26:54,260
海底的变化
The equalization of the oceanic seabeds

1817
02:26:54,290 --> 02:26:56,960
并不像我们预料的那么糟糕
has not turned out to be as extreme as we expected.

1818
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:58,850
海水在逐渐退去
The waters are receding.

1819
02:26:58,880 --> 02:26:59,970
比我们想像的快得多
Much faster than we thought.

1820
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:01,890
感谢上帝 还有
Thank God. And,

1821
02:27:01,930 --> 02:27:02,900
这很难以置信
This is hard to believe.

1822
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:06,220
不过 喜马拉雅山不再是世界屋脊了
But the Himalayas are no longer the roof of the world.

1823
02:27:06,260 --> 02:27:09,500
现在是尼泊尔 夸祖鲁的 德拉肯斯山脉
It's now the Drakensberg mountains of KwaZulu, Nepal.

1824
02:27:09,560 --> 02:27:12,020
非洲大陆板块整体上升了
The entire African continent has just risen.

1825
02:27:12,050 --> 02:27:14,600
七千英尺 以后不太可能被淹了
7.000 feet, and unlikely they are even flooded.

1826
02:27:14,700 --> 02:27:17,480
所以它才被称为充满希望的好望角
That's why they call it The Cape of Good Hope.

1827
02:27:17,520 --> 02:27:19,360
我们正向那里前进
We've already set course for it.

1828
02:27:26,620 --> 02:27:29,040
爹地 我们什么时候回家?
Daddy, when will we go back home?

1829
02:27:29,070 --> 02:27:30,530
这个嘛 我们讨论过了
Well, we talked about that.

1830
02:27:30,570 --> 02:27:33,000
我们打算在这里重新安家
We're gonna find a new home out here somewhere.

1831
02:27:33,800 --> 02:27:34,670
对吧?
Right?

1832
02:27:34,710 --> 02:27:37,100
只要我们在一起 那就是家了
Wherever we're all together. That's home.

1833
02:27:37,620 --> 02:27:40,090
对吧? 你害怕了吗?
Right? You are scared?

1834
02:27:40,120 --> 02:27:41,470
我才不害怕呢
I am not.

1835
02:27:43,470 --> 02:27:45,340
我不用纸尿裤了
No more pull-ups.

1836
02:27:48,140 --> 02:27:49,640
好极了
Nice.

1837
02:28:43,070 --> 02:28:47,000
