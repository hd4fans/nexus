1
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,002
Peking - China.

2
00:06:22,877 --> 00:06:25,359
The summer
of the year 1900.

3
00:06:26,296 --> 00:06:28,458
The rains are late,

4
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,132
the crops have failed,

5
00:06:31,842 --> 00:06:34,244
a hundred million
Chinese are hungry

6
00:06:34,552 --> 00:06:36,794
and a violent wind
of discontent

7
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:38,457
disturbs the land.

8
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,552
Within the foreign compound

9
00:06:42,016 --> 00:06:44,618
a thousand foreigners
live and work,

10
00:06:44,934 --> 00:06:47,776
citizens of a dozen
far-off nations.

11
00:07:06,574 --> 00:07:08,375
Priests and missionaries,

12
00:07:08,784 --> 00:07:10,946
bankers and businessmen,

13
00:07:11,328 --> 00:07:13,169
engineers and adventurers,

14
00:07:13,455 --> 00:07:16,297
diplomats,
soldiers and students...

15
00:07:16,873 --> 00:07:19,435
People with families, homes,

16
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,001
jobs.

17
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:24,985
Many have lived here
a lifetime and feel secure

18
00:07:25,337 --> 00:07:27,579
as they go about
their daily routine.

19
00:09:01,362 --> 00:09:03,644
What is
that terrible noise?

20
00:09:04,197 --> 00:09:07,240
Different nations
saying the same thing,

21
00:09:07,575 --> 00:09:08,656
We want China.

22
00:09:18,249 --> 00:09:22,132
Sha-shao!

23
00:09:26,254 --> 00:09:28,256
Separated from the compound

24
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:30,909
by only
a wall and a gate,

25
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,141
is the Forbidden City.

26
00:09:34,176 --> 00:09:37,138
Here, in untouchable isolation

27
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,523
lives the Dowager Empress,
last of the Manchus.

28
00:09:42,265 --> 00:09:44,507
Protected by
an army of eunuchs,

29
00:09:44,892 --> 00:09:47,814
she holds court
and confers with her ministers,

30
00:09:48,812 --> 00:09:50,453
mandarins and generals.

31
00:09:51,647 --> 00:09:52,808
Halt the execution.

32
00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:55,000
But Prince Tuan s orders!

33
00:09:56,691 --> 00:09:57,651
Now

34
00:09:57,902 --> 00:09:59,143
you have my orders.
The nightingale will recover.

35
00:11:05,823 --> 00:11:08,145
The Court physician s
arts will work.

36
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:23,597
Only yesterday
I listened to its song.

37
00:11:24,586 --> 00:11:26,507
The execution
has been stopped.

38
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:28,942
Who?

39
00:11:29,213 --> 00:11:30,133
Jung-Lu,

40
00:11:30,632 --> 00:11:31,673
Your Majesty,

41
00:11:42,098 --> 00:11:44,580
I come to ask
your displeasure.

42
00:11:45,142 --> 00:11:47,103
My life instead
of the Colonel s.

43
00:11:47,393 --> 00:11:49,074
We cannot spare you.

44
00:11:49,561 --> 00:11:52,443
I gave the order
to fire on the Boxers.

45
00:11:53,063 --> 00:11:56,386
They were burning missions,
killing foreigners.

46
00:11:58,192 --> 00:11:59,713
We have sad news.

47
00:12:01,111 --> 00:12:02,031
The nightingale...

48
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:03,839
it was your gift.

49
00:12:04,196 --> 00:12:05,837
Do you remember, Jung-Lu?

50
00:12:06,198 --> 00:12:07,439
I have not forgotten.

51
00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:13,283
I live to serve Your Majesty.

52
00:12:13,578 --> 00:12:16,581
How does the attack
on the Boxers serve

53
00:12:16,913 --> 00:12:17,633
Her Highness?

54
00:12:17,873 --> 00:12:20,916
If they are unchecked,
foreign armies will fall

55
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,492
- on China.
- We are tens of millions.

56
00:12:24,293 --> 00:12:28,417
Does the Empress believe that
where the imperial Army has failed,

57
00:12:28,798 --> 00:12:29,919
the rabble will succeed?

58
00:12:30,173 --> 00:12:34,016
- Our Gods are with the Boxers.
- The nightingale is still.

59
00:12:34,842 --> 00:12:37,364
I hear only
the sound of crows.

60
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,471
Your Majesty,

61
00:12:45,391 --> 00:12:47,633
a violent wind
is short-lived.

62
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:51,029
The Boxers have arisen
like the wind and rain,

63
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:52,686
and like the wind

64
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,300
and the rain, will die.

65
00:12:59,693 --> 00:13:02,856
May the Boxers be guided
by the will of the gods.

66
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:05,571
About the Colonel, Your Majesty.

67
00:13:05,864 --> 00:13:07,385
His end
will be a sign,

68
00:13:08,367 --> 00:13:10,529
and a warning
to the foreigners.

69
00:13:11,117 --> 00:13:13,399
His death
is of no consequence.

70
00:13:14,162 --> 00:13:17,285
But his life has set
my Prince against my General

71
00:13:18,206 --> 00:13:21,409
and this disturbs
the morning s tranquility.

72
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:24,211
Let him die
for this offense.

73
00:13:33,216 --> 00:13:35,137
You are concerned, Jung-Lu?

74
00:13:36,844 --> 00:13:40,007
If the Boxers fail,
I will give the foreigners

75
00:13:40,346 --> 00:13:42,508
Prince Tuan s head.

76
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,727
Eyes front, soldier.

77
00:14:32,507 --> 00:14:34,829
All right,
Marines, eyes front!

78
00:14:37,219 --> 00:14:40,622
We re almost in Peking,
the capital city of China.

79
00:14:41,555 --> 00:14:44,718
This is an ancient,
highly cultured civilization,

80
00:14:45,308 --> 00:14:48,110
so don’t think
you re any better than them

81
00:14:48,436 --> 00:14:50,237
because they
can t speak English.

82
00:14:51,228 --> 00:14:53,430
A few Chinese words
go a long way.

83
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,551
Repeat after me.
The word for yes is shih.

84
00:15:00,026 --> 00:15:00,546
Shih.

85
00:15:00,777 --> 00:15:04,340
- The word for no is poo shih.
- Poo shih.

86
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:08,876
it s the same here
as anywhere else in the world,

87
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,136
everything has a price.

88
00:15:11,743 --> 00:15:15,146
Pay your money and
don’t expect any free samples.

89
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,271
Yes, sir.

90
00:15:44,807 --> 00:15:47,249
Right turn!

91
00:15:53,605 --> 00:15:55,607
Column... Halt!

92
00:16:14,452 --> 00:16:16,013
We going to stop that, Major?

93
00:16:19,082 --> 00:16:20,443
Stay right there!

94
00:16:21,957 --> 00:16:23,438
- Murphy!
- Yes, sir?

95
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,820
Ni hao.

96
00:17:05,154 --> 00:17:08,837
Tell the Boxer chief
I want to do business with him.

97
00:17:09,574 --> 00:17:11,135
I want to buy
the old man.

98
00:17:11,701 --> 00:17:13,542
But he's not American.

99
00:17:14,828 --> 00:17:15,989
Twenty dollars.

100
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,093
Hold it!

101
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,932
Tell him the old man
must be alive.

102
00:17:31,965 --> 00:17:33,406
Nothing if he s dead.

103
00:17:37,843 --> 00:17:38,924
Forty dollars.

104
00:17:41,555 --> 00:17:42,556
All right.

105
00:17:50,143 --> 00:17:51,103
He s dead.

106
00:17:55,314 --> 00:17:56,234
But he say

107
00:17:56,482 --> 00:17:58,644
you pay
for spoiling the ceremony.

108
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,941
Nothing doing.

109
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:02,691
Twenty dollars.

110
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:19,558
Tell him
I'll still do business.

111
00:18:20,457 --> 00:18:21,818
I'll buy
the dead Boxer.

112
00:18:24,168 --> 00:18:25,369
Forty dollars.

113
00:18:27,212 --> 00:18:28,333
Twenty dollars.

114
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:44,617
- Did you fire that shot?
- Yes, sir.

115
00:18:45,515 --> 00:18:47,116
Nice shooting, Sergeant.

116
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:48,600
Thank you, Major.

117
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,941
That'll cost you twenty bucks

118
00:18:51,561 --> 00:18:53,482
out of your pay.
Fall in!

119
00:18:53,771 --> 00:18:55,732
Alright...
Fall in!

120
00:19:27,794 --> 00:19:30,476
- Take them to the barracks.
- Yes, sir.

121
00:19:30,797 --> 00:19:32,118
- Murphy!
- Sir?

122
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:16,955
Madame.

123
00:20:18,371 --> 00:20:19,892
Tell her I’m waiting.

124
00:20:20,164 --> 00:20:22,766
I have sent her
a note, Excellency.

125
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,165
You re the owner.
Tell her.

126
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,462
Here s your key, Count.

127
00:20:28,545 --> 00:20:30,466
Excellency, please.

128
00:20:31,255 --> 00:20:34,898
As Russian Minister here
I order you to get her down.

129
00:20:35,258 --> 00:20:36,779
As you wish, Excellency.

130
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:40,613
But remember she is still
a guest. I cannot order her.

131
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:45,232
Excellency, I think
you need a cold drink.

132
00:20:46,015 --> 00:20:48,257
- And so do I.
- Champagne, sir?

133
00:21:00,775 --> 00:21:01,695
How are you?

134
00:21:01,943 --> 00:21:04,065
it's been a long time.

135
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:05,990
Natasha!

136
00:21:07,363 --> 00:21:08,564
Baroness Ivanoff!

137
00:21:09,115 --> 00:21:10,276
Yes, Sergei?

138
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:13,616
You keep me waiting
and then ignore me.

139
00:21:14,327 --> 00:21:16,449
You are a little
nervous, Sergei.

140
00:21:17,287 --> 00:21:19,289
I suggest something cool

141
00:21:20,622 --> 00:21:21,663
for all of us.

142
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:27,080
Excuse me.

143
00:21:38,426 --> 00:21:39,547
Natasha...

144
00:21:40,219 --> 00:21:40,819
Thank you.

145
00:21:44,389 --> 00:21:46,310
I won t talk
about the necklace.

146
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,961
But you are.

147
00:21:48,392 --> 00:21:51,595
- As Russian Minister in Peking...
- Please, Sergei,

148
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:53,788
speak as
my brother-in-law.

149
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:58,150
Natasha,
I've told Bergmann

150
00:21:58,691 --> 00:22:00,492
your visa s canceled.

151
00:22:02,401 --> 00:22:04,883
So you cannot stay
in this hotel.

152
00:22:05,569 --> 00:22:08,491
Or in Peking
or even in China.

153
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:12,073
- By law you don’t exist.
- That s frightening.

154
00:22:12,783 --> 00:22:14,104
Where will you go?

155
00:22:15,202 --> 00:22:16,723
To your Chinese friends?

156
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:18,840
How you hate me, don’t you?

157
00:22:20,163 --> 00:22:21,524
No, you re wrong.

158
00:22:23,124 --> 00:22:24,205
I don’t hate you.

159
00:22:25,876 --> 00:22:26,917
Go!

160
00:22:28,503 --> 00:22:29,624
You fool.

161
00:22:31,421 --> 00:22:32,862
Is it my fault,

162
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:35,940
if you lose everything

163
00:22:36,633 --> 00:22:39,475
and end up naked
in the street...?

164
00:22:39,886 --> 00:22:41,287
Not completely naked.

165
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:43,776
There s still the necklace.

166
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:50,649
Today...

167
00:22:51,143 --> 00:22:53,465
- She has to go today.
- Yes, sir.

168
00:22:54,146 --> 00:22:55,427
I'll see to it.

169
00:23:02,986 --> 00:23:03,946
Good evening.

170
00:23:04,194 --> 00:23:06,476
I want a room
with a bath this time.

171
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:10,062
- Have you reserved, sir?
- You're late, Lewis.

172
00:23:10,574 --> 00:23:11,494
Hello.

173
00:23:12,367 --> 00:23:13,167
Hello.

174
00:23:13,451 --> 00:23:14,652
When did you arrive?

175
00:23:15,451 --> 00:23:17,453
- Today.
- Why so late?

176
00:23:17,871 --> 00:23:19,672
We walked
the last 10 miles.

177
00:23:20,372 --> 00:23:21,893
Don’t the trains work now?

178
00:23:22,165 --> 00:23:24,287
Gentlemen, the railroad
is no more.

179
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,424
- Major Lewis!
- Bergmann.

180
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:29,761
- Is there a room for me?
- They re all taken.

181
00:23:30,213 --> 00:23:31,294
But if you'll wait

182
00:23:31,546 --> 00:23:32,867
- a short while...
- Fine.

183
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,091
Thanks, Chiang.
Here you are.

184
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,185
Any time you need me.

185
00:23:37,843 --> 00:23:40,325
Half my life s here.
Take care of it.

186
00:23:40,636 --> 00:23:42,958
And more of your life’s here.

187
00:23:45,931 --> 00:23:47,172
Oh, yes.

188
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,751
Let me use the bin.

189
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,141
Wont you open it?

190
00:23:55,146 --> 00:23:56,987
Open it and
you must read it.

191
00:23:57,481 --> 00:23:58,802
Then you must answer.

192
00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:00,579
Lewis!

193
00:24:00,817 --> 00:24:02,458
- Ah, Carlo!
- My dear chap!

194
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:04,424
- Captain.
- You re late.

195
00:24:04,695 --> 00:24:05,816
What kept you?

196
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,360
I lost 2 men.
Had to bury them.

197
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,306
- Come on, let's get a drink.
- Alright.

198
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,557
Try and get a room
here too, Andy.

199
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,871
I want to look up the kid.

200
00:24:17,203 --> 00:24:18,884
Ah yes, your little girl.

201
00:24:20,247 --> 00:24:22,409
- How old is she now?
-11.

202
00:24:22,748 --> 00:24:24,149
No, she must be 12.

203
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:27,461
It s a pity. No mother
and practically no father.

204
00:24:27,794 --> 00:24:28,795
What can I do?

205
00:24:29,503 --> 00:24:32,345
She s in a French mission
for Chinese orphans.

206
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:34,153
You re better than most.

207
00:24:35,215 --> 00:24:36,736
You do try to see her.

208
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:40,172
But leaving her in a mission
is no way to raise her.

209
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,631
But what do I do?

210
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:43,450
Take her to Illinois?

211
00:24:43,721 --> 00:24:45,763
How would she make out there?

212
00:24:46,057 --> 00:24:47,978
They'd treat her
like a freak.

213
00:24:48,267 --> 00:24:50,829
She s better off
among her own kind.

214
00:24:51,394 --> 00:24:53,115
- You really think so?
- Sure.

215
00:24:54,896 --> 00:24:56,457
May I have your key?

216
00:24:58,356 --> 00:25:00,958
I need it for
the American officer.

217
00:25:04,361 --> 00:25:05,321
Thank you.

218
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,830
Besides,

219
00:25:07,071 --> 00:25:08,992
you have to live
your own life.

220
00:25:16,827 --> 00:25:18,588
I've just had an invitation.

221
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:28,395
Please sit down, Major.

222
00:25:29,837 --> 00:25:31,839
Ask him and
we'll drink together.

223
00:25:33,339 --> 00:25:34,620
He d tell us his troubles.

224
00:25:35,632 --> 00:25:37,233
What shall I tell you?

225
00:25:38,676 --> 00:25:40,277
That you're happy I’m here.

226
00:25:41,594 --> 00:25:42,875
You re very direct.

227
00:25:43,721 --> 00:25:45,562
I’m a marine.
I’m short on time.

228
00:25:48,099 --> 00:25:49,820
How much is there for me?

229
00:25:51,894 --> 00:25:52,534
All you want.

230
00:25:55,396 --> 00:25:58,158
Have you found
this approach successful?

231
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:01,451
Not really, no.

232
00:26:02,025 --> 00:26:03,306
I don’t know another.

233
00:26:06,111 --> 00:26:07,512
Keep drinking, Major.

234
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,791
The uniform
will hold you.

235
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,972
- Clever women make me nervous.
- No, please...

236
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:23,407
Please don’t go.

237
00:26:30,837 --> 00:26:33,279
What can I offer you?
My life?

238
00:26:33,756 --> 00:26:34,917
My room.

239
00:26:35,715 --> 00:26:36,796
They gave it to you.

240
00:26:41,845 --> 00:26:43,446
Is that too much to ask?

241
00:26:44,055 --> 00:26:46,097
My life isn't worth much,

242
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,622
but hotel rooms here
are at a premium.

243
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:52,950
Do you always offer
your life to strangers?

244
00:26:54,019 --> 00:26:55,460
To a soldier, strangers

245
00:26:55,729 --> 00:26:56,810
are the best friends.

246
00:26:57,063 --> 00:26:58,584
I’m not in uniform, Major.

247
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,001
Things are fine
as they are.

248
00:27:05,277 --> 00:27:06,237
Major Lewis.

249
00:27:07,112 --> 00:27:09,073
A British orderly
to see you.

250
00:27:12,574 --> 00:27:14,936
The Minister wishes
to see you, sir.

251
00:27:15,243 --> 00:27:16,964
He told me to tell you

252
00:27:17,245 --> 00:27:20,248
he s been authorized
to act for your Minister.

253
00:27:20,788 --> 00:27:23,750
Fine. Tell him
I'll be right along.

254
00:27:24,124 --> 00:27:25,044
Yes, sir.

255
00:27:32,462 --> 00:27:33,463
Here s you key.

256
00:27:34,297 --> 00:27:35,217
Thanks.

257
00:27:35,756 --> 00:27:37,077
What about your things?

258
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:45,682
- Put them back.
- But there s only one room.

259
00:27:46,389 --> 00:27:49,672
Let the Baroness
figure it out. She s clever.

260
00:27:51,142 --> 00:27:52,503
Don’t laugh yet, Major.

261
00:27:55,561 --> 00:27:57,282
It s a very small room.

262
00:27:58,522 --> 00:28:00,804
I've been
in tight places before.

263
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,061
So have I, Major.

264
00:28:23,581 --> 00:28:24,862
- Daddy!
- Teresa!

265
00:28:27,001 --> 00:28:27,961
Daddy!

266
00:28:30,044 --> 00:28:30,964
Daddy!

267
00:28:48,306 --> 00:28:50,748
- Hello, Britten.
- Good day, sir.

268
00:28:51,809 --> 00:28:53,370
Wake up, sentries!

269
00:28:54,019 --> 00:28:56,341
Take a tip
from an old soldier.

270
00:28:56,938 --> 00:29:00,301
Whenever you see a Major
of the American Marines,

271
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,651
you will present arms.

272
00:29:03,067 --> 00:29:04,228
And don't forget it!

273
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:09,372
If this be I,
as I suppose it be,

274
00:29:09,821 --> 00:29:12,303
my little dog
will know me.

275
00:29:13,033 --> 00:29:13,993
Come in.

276
00:29:16,285 --> 00:29:18,086
I’m, sorry,
are you busy?

277
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:20,211
Of course I am.
I always am.

278
00:29:20,745 --> 00:29:22,907
Busier than usual?
Or just busy?

279
00:29:23,706 --> 00:29:24,827
Both.

280
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:28,467
Well, what s
the pressing female problem?

281
00:29:29,168 --> 00:29:31,770
Just this,
Am I to pack or not to pack?

282
00:29:32,087 --> 00:29:33,448
Do we go to England?

283
00:29:33,713 --> 00:29:35,995
Do we leave
this year or not?

284
00:29:42,136 --> 00:29:43,137
I don’t know.

285
00:29:43,803 --> 00:29:44,804
You don’t know...

286
00:29:45,055 --> 00:29:48,218
Pack. If we don’t go,
all you need do is unpack.

287
00:29:49,015 --> 00:29:51,297
If men had
to do the packing,

288
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,321
the world
would be different.

289
00:29:53,602 --> 00:29:54,883
- If I had my way...
- What?

290
00:29:55,144 --> 00:29:58,627
We d have packed long since
and now be miles away.

291
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,141
We?

292
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:01,959
A comforting thought.

293
00:30:02,357 --> 00:30:03,758
Thank you, darling.

294
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:07,612
Will it all
go up in flames?

295
00:30:08,529 --> 00:30:10,771
- Not if I can help it.
- What?

296
00:30:11,864 --> 00:30:13,585
I'll put it
in a nutshell.

297
00:30:14,242 --> 00:30:17,725
If I encourage the Great Powers
to be tough with China,

298
00:30:18,077 --> 00:30:21,440
China will become just
another battlefield for them

299
00:30:21,788 --> 00:30:22,949
to fight over.

300
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:27,044
It s wiser to accept
temporary humiliation

301
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:29,176
at the hands
of the Boxers

302
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,062
in the hope that
by damping down the fire,

303
00:30:32,545 --> 00:30:34,426
the kettle
won t boil over.

304
00:30:34,714 --> 00:30:35,835
And then?

305
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:40,223
I shall probably receive
the Government s displeasure,

306
00:30:40,592 --> 00:30:43,554
and we'll be retired
on an inadequate pension.

307
00:30:44,929 --> 00:30:47,251
Remember what Napoleon said?

308
00:30:47,557 --> 00:30:48,718
I never forget it.

309
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,501
Let China sleep.

310
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:53,489
' When she wakes,
the world will tremble.

311
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:57,110
He said a lot, didn't he?

312
00:30:58,604 --> 00:30:59,484
Come in.

313
00:31:01,983 --> 00:31:04,105
- Major Lewis, sir.
- Ask him to wait.

314
00:31:04,401 --> 00:31:07,283
Darling, I have to put on
my official face.

315
00:31:08,737 --> 00:31:10,939
You haven’t forgotten
our soirée?

316
00:31:11,321 --> 00:31:14,083
Twenty-four bottles of champagne
are already on ice.

317
00:31:14,449 --> 00:31:18,132
- Anything else the Sahib requires?
- The first waltz.

318
00:31:18,535 --> 00:31:19,656
I'll consider it.

319
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:28,668
Philip!

320
00:31:33,128 --> 00:31:34,649
Major Lewis, Sir Arthur.

321
00:31:40,383 --> 00:31:44,026
Stand up, sit down,
or walk around the room.

322
00:31:44,804 --> 00:31:47,726
I'll walk around.
You please yourself.

323
00:31:48,056 --> 00:31:50,458
I have an unpleasant
task to fulfill.

324
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:55,451
First, congratulations on
your initiative this morning.

325
00:31:55,811 --> 00:31:57,412
We were a little late.

326
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:00,372
Unfortunate that
a Chinese was killed.

327
00:32:00,773 --> 00:32:03,615
- A Boxer?
- A Chinese citizen, Major.

328
00:32:04,568 --> 00:32:06,810
You re not
in the Wild West now.

329
00:32:07,986 --> 00:32:10,348
You can t shoot
Chinese like red Indians.

330
00:32:10,655 --> 00:32:11,575
No, sir.

331
00:32:12,573 --> 00:32:15,215
Secondly,
I warn you that such

332
00:32:15,575 --> 00:32:17,056
irresponsible behaviour,

333
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:19,169
could easily
involve us all

334
00:32:19,453 --> 00:32:21,855
in a great conflagration.

335
00:32:22,163 --> 00:32:23,324
I understand.

336
00:32:24,706 --> 00:32:26,828
And lastly, since

337
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:30,649
your Minister is suffering
from a diplomatic illness,

338
00:32:31,002 --> 00:32:33,804
you are required
here no longer.

339
00:32:36,256 --> 00:32:38,498
No longer
required by whom?

340
00:32:39,175 --> 00:32:41,897
This is a message
from your own Legation.

341
00:32:42,218 --> 00:32:44,260
I d be delighted
if you stayed.

342
00:32:45,054 --> 00:32:46,014
Yes, sir.

343
00:32:48,055 --> 00:32:50,457
You know all hell s
going to break loose?

344
00:32:51,642 --> 00:32:55,245
If it does, it will not be
because we have provoked it.

345
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:59,143
So we'll all
just walk soft and

346
00:32:59,731 --> 00:33:00,732
hope for the best.

347
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:04,200
If we walked on our knees,
we can t stop it.

348
00:33:04,985 --> 00:33:07,587
I've just marched
from Tientsin.

349
00:33:07,987 --> 00:33:09,508
Boxers are everywhere.

350
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,740
Killing white men,
missionaries,

351
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:14,232
and all Chinese Christians.

352
00:33:14,532 --> 00:33:17,254
The Imperial Army s
doing nothing about it.

353
00:33:17,868 --> 00:33:20,030
Boxers have been
around for years.

354
00:33:20,327 --> 00:33:22,369
You re unnecessarily alarmed.

355
00:33:22,663 --> 00:33:24,184
Well, the next time

356
00:33:24,873 --> 00:33:28,596
I see them killing an English
priest, I'll try not to be.

357
00:33:31,377 --> 00:33:35,100
I've been a soldier myself.
I understand how you feel.

358
00:33:36,132 --> 00:33:38,254
But my job s to see
the larger picture.

359
00:33:38,924 --> 00:33:40,966
I wouldn't know about that.

360
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:44,753
I just patrol the rice paddies
in the back country.

361
00:33:45,512 --> 00:33:46,833
I know this much...

362
00:33:47,388 --> 00:33:50,190
If the Boxers come,
we'll need more soldiers

363
00:33:50,516 --> 00:33:52,558
in these compounds.

364
00:33:55,727 --> 00:33:57,969
Well, now we’ve both
had our say.

365
00:34:03,858 --> 00:34:05,219
I'll go quietly.

366
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:09,691
Oh, by the way,

367
00:34:09,987 --> 00:34:11,828
it s our Queen s birthday.

368
00:34:12,322 --> 00:34:15,204
Tonight we re entertaining.
Why not come?

369
00:34:16,658 --> 00:34:17,578
Thank you.

370
00:34:24,373 --> 00:34:27,496
I won t leave Ming.
I'll pack him in my case.

371
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:29,754
Don’t be silly.
He d suffocate.

372
00:34:30,586 --> 00:34:32,988
- What s that?
- He d suffocate.

373
00:34:33,588 --> 00:34:35,830
- It s only for five weeks.
- Come on.

374
00:34:43,343 --> 00:34:45,264
May we speak
to you, father?

375
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,341
It s very important.

376
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:53,382
There are no negotiations
at the moment. What is it?

377
00:34:54,143 --> 00:34:56,905
Mother says we can't
take Ming to England.

378
00:34:57,604 --> 00:35:00,446
- I wont leave my dog.
- He s my dog.

379
00:35:00,773 --> 00:35:03,856
- Who feeds him?
- Who taught him to sit up?

380
00:35:04,233 --> 00:35:07,155
Tell you what.
We'll cut him exactly in two.

381
00:35:07,485 --> 00:35:08,646
You each get a half.

382
00:35:09,362 --> 00:35:12,485
- Father. Don’t play King Solomon.
- Well, I tried.

383
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:26,966
Atten...

384
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:29,298
shun!

385
00:35:33,337 --> 00:35:35,419
Shoulder...

386
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,631
arms!

387
00:35:45,262 --> 00:35:49,546
Present...

388
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:51,895
arms!

389
00:36:13,031 --> 00:36:16,594
Slope...

390
00:36:17,992 --> 00:36:18,993
arms!

391
00:36:38,715 --> 00:36:41,798
His Excellency,
the Minister of Austria-Hungary

392
00:36:42,259 --> 00:36:44,541
and the Baroness Von Riedel.

393
00:36:45,553 --> 00:36:48,916
Welcome, Prince Tuan,
to Her Majesty s Legation.

394
00:36:49,514 --> 00:36:51,075
I am deeply honoured.

395
00:36:58,604 --> 00:37:02,047
His Imperial Highness,
Prince Tuan.

396
00:37:07,026 --> 00:37:09,428
I bring greetings
from our Empress.

397
00:37:09,737 --> 00:37:11,739
You are
most welcome, Highness.

398
00:37:12,155 --> 00:37:15,238
Greeting and felicitations
to your great queen.

399
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,288
May the lions
of China and Britain

400
00:37:45,386 --> 00:37:47,227
live in peace forever.

401
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:50,092
Our Queen is touched
by the words

402
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,512
of your illustrious Empress.

403
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:56,411
Your Imperial Highness,

404
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,541
Your Excellencies,

405
00:37:58,813 --> 00:38:00,734
ladies and gentlemen,

406
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,083
the first dance
will be the Military Two-Step.

407
00:38:58,854 --> 00:39:01,096
Marvellous, fabulous.

408
00:39:01,855 --> 00:39:03,336
They should be
around my neck.

409
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:06,690
Of course, Sophie,
you look naked without them.

410
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:57,324
- Shall we join the line.
- No.

411
00:39:58,019 --> 00:39:58,939
Not yet.

412
00:40:00,229 --> 00:40:02,431
I've waited
for this a long time,

413
00:40:03,899 --> 00:40:05,740
and I’m enjoying it.

414
00:40:26,873 --> 00:40:29,795
Natasha, you blind us
with your glitter.

415
00:40:30,709 --> 00:40:33,311
Would you recognize me
without them?

416
00:40:34,086 --> 00:40:36,648
I understand
you're going to Tientsin.

417
00:40:37,171 --> 00:40:38,612
That's right, Excellency.

418
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:42,533
There’s a Russian woman
who wishes to leave Peking.

419
00:40:42,883 --> 00:40:44,604
Anyone we know, Sergei?

420
00:40:44,885 --> 00:40:46,366
She d do well
to meet you.

421
00:40:46,636 --> 00:40:49,238
It may be her only chance
to reach Tientsin.

422
00:40:49,972 --> 00:40:50,572
It might be...

423
00:40:50,973 --> 00:40:54,576
If you disregard me the
Russian government will remember.

424
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:21,120
- Sir Arthur.
- Evening, Major.

425
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:22,451
Lady Robertson.

426
00:41:22,703 --> 00:41:24,825
I wanted
to thank you personally

427
00:41:25,122 --> 00:41:27,524
for trying
to help Father Bemish.

428
00:41:29,499 --> 00:41:30,620
You know the Baroness?

429
00:41:32,502 --> 00:41:33,583
Yes, of course.

430
00:41:36,421 --> 00:41:38,302
It s been a long time.

431
00:41:42,592 --> 00:41:45,034
I know my husband
has thanked you.

432
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:47,672
Yes, I've expressed
my gratitude.

433
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:49,731
This is Baroness Ivanoff.

434
00:41:50,722 --> 00:41:52,724
- And Major Lewis.
- Your Highness.

435
00:41:53,141 --> 00:41:54,702
You must be the American

436
00:41:54,975 --> 00:41:58,778
who had the encounter
with the Boxers this morning.

437
00:42:02,939 --> 00:42:05,421
It was the priest
who had the hard time.

438
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,182
My government
is most distressed.

439
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:12,728
But do not conclude
that all Boxers are bandits.

440
00:42:13,071 --> 00:42:15,713
Most of them
are harmless vagabonds.

441
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:18,321
Market place entertainers,

442
00:42:18,699 --> 00:42:21,101
much like the gypsies
in your country.

443
00:42:22,077 --> 00:42:23,358
In fact, Sir Arthur,

444
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:27,303
I have brought such a troupe
to entertain your guests

445
00:42:27,664 --> 00:42:28,624
tonight.

446
00:42:29,249 --> 00:42:30,730
Boxers here?

447
00:42:31,501 --> 00:42:32,862
With your permission.

448
00:42:33,293 --> 00:42:34,694
Of course, Your Highness.

449
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,001
He wants you
to take this sword

450
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:31,251
and try to strike him.

451
00:44:35,295 --> 00:44:37,897
Try it.
It s part of the performance.

452
00:44:48,595 --> 00:44:50,997
If I kill a Boxer,
does that, er...

453
00:44:51,305 --> 00:44:53,347
create a diplomatic incident?

454
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,321
There is no danger.

455
00:45:22,994 --> 00:45:24,475
You've made your point.

456
00:45:25,371 --> 00:45:25,971
Not quite.

457
00:45:33,376 --> 00:45:34,016
Bravo!

458
00:45:42,383 --> 00:45:44,545
I guess he wasn't
a true believer.

459
00:45:45,634 --> 00:45:49,437
It seems, Sir Arthur, that
your troops are invulnerable.

460
00:45:50,389 --> 00:45:52,391
Forgive me,
but the Major

461
00:45:52,681 --> 00:45:54,602
doesn’t seem
to play the game

462
00:45:54,891 --> 00:45:57,013
according to Chinese rules.

463
00:45:59,311 --> 00:46:00,712
I apologize, Sir Arthur.

464
00:46:01,771 --> 00:46:03,372
I don’t think he came here

465
00:46:03,646 --> 00:46:05,127
tonight to play games.

466
00:46:07,441 --> 00:46:08,522
Good night.

467
00:46:18,282 --> 00:46:20,123
Unfortunately, Sir Arthur,

468
00:46:20,408 --> 00:46:23,010
I must return
to my duties at the palace.

469
00:46:23,535 --> 00:46:24,856
No need to escort me.

470
00:46:32,292 --> 00:46:35,895
Ladies and gentlemen,
the next dance will be a waltz.

471
00:46:42,298 --> 00:46:45,661
- Aword, Sir Arthur.
- This is an insult to the British

472
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:47,931
and a challenge
to all Powers!

473
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:50,502
Areport
will reach the Kaiser.

474
00:46:50,847 --> 00:46:52,808
Her Majesty's Government

475
00:46:53,098 --> 00:46:56,781
is not alarmed by this
Boxer invasion of its Embassy.

476
00:46:57,143 --> 00:46:59,865
I shall complain
to the Chinese ministry.

477
00:47:00,186 --> 00:47:02,388
What will you do, Sir Arthur?

478
00:47:02,688 --> 00:47:05,610
I intend to have
a glass of champagne.

479
00:47:19,657 --> 00:47:22,179
You know,
I admire Sir Arthur.

480
00:47:22,535 --> 00:47:25,898
He makes me think
that God must be an Englishman.

481
00:47:34,502 --> 00:47:37,424
We go and we go
and we don't get anywhere.

482
00:47:38,337 --> 00:47:40,339
Why not head back to the hotel?

483
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,642
- Are you tired, Major?
- Tired? No.

484
00:47:44,967 --> 00:47:47,409
Ready to turn in? Maybe.

485
00:47:51,347 --> 00:47:53,389
Ever been
inside this temple?

486
00:47:53,682 --> 00:47:56,044
Wed get a better drink
at the hotel.

487
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:06,252
Very interesting.
Can we go now?

488
00:48:08,942 --> 00:48:11,064
But we haven’t
had our dance yet.

489
00:48:11,361 --> 00:48:12,281
Shall we?

490
00:48:23,285 --> 00:48:25,046
What'll you do
in Tientsin?

491
00:48:25,328 --> 00:48:27,249
I'll be entirely
in your hands.

492
00:48:27,539 --> 00:48:30,782
You are now but you keep
slipping through my fingers.

493
00:48:38,129 --> 00:48:41,892
I think I’ll get you to take me
to San Francisco with you.

494
00:48:43,341 --> 00:48:44,982
Why to San Francisco?

495
00:48:45,259 --> 00:48:47,621
It s where
they found all the gold.

496
00:49:05,564 --> 00:49:06,645
Just a minute.

497
00:49:33,126 --> 00:49:34,967
What s that trinket worth?
A lot of money.

498
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:25,333
We won t leave today. They've
killed the German Minister.

499
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:29,953
But Matt, we must leave...
I have to leave.

500
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,001
You have to wait.

501
00:50:38,254 --> 00:50:39,615
Your sword, Sir Arthur.

502
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:08,045
You are well, Sir Arthur?

503
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:10,327
If you are, Your Majesty.

504
00:51:11,069 --> 00:51:13,951
- We are pleased to receive you.
- It s an honour,

505
00:51:14,612 --> 00:51:15,532
Your Majesty.

506
00:51:15,779 --> 00:51:19,382
We have been informed
of the German Minister s death.

507
00:51:20,367 --> 00:51:22,128
The Boxers
will be punished.

508
00:51:23,076 --> 00:51:26,759
But the people s anger
cannot be quieted so easily.

509
00:51:27,829 --> 00:51:29,871
The Germans
have seized Kiaochow,

510
00:51:30,164 --> 00:51:32,446
the Russians Port Arthur.

511
00:51:32,749 --> 00:51:35,631
The French have obtained
concessions in Yunnan,

512
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,761
Kwangsi and Kwangtung.

513
00:51:38,504 --> 00:51:41,827
In all, thirteen of the
eighteen provinces of China

514
00:51:42,173 --> 00:51:43,734
are under
foreign control.

515
00:51:45,133 --> 00:51:47,135
Warships occupy our harbors,

516
00:51:47,427 --> 00:51:49,348
foreign armies
fill our forts,

517
00:51:50,011 --> 00:51:52,653
foreign merchants
administer our banks,

518
00:51:53,346 --> 00:51:56,909
foreign gods disturb
the spirits of our ancestors.

519
00:51:57,766 --> 00:52:00,128
Is it surprising
our people are aroused?

520
00:52:00,893 --> 00:52:02,734
Please allow me to observe

521
00:52:03,354 --> 00:52:06,957
that Boxer violence cannot
redress China s grievances.

522
00:52:07,648 --> 00:52:09,690
China is a prostrate cow!

523
00:52:10,776 --> 00:52:14,459
The Powers are
butchering her for her meat.

524
00:52:14,862 --> 00:52:18,585
If China is a cow, she is
indeed a marvellous animal

525
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:20,871
that gives
both meat and milk,

526
00:52:21,283 --> 00:52:23,605
but at the same time
grows stronger.

527
00:52:24,577 --> 00:52:26,739
She learns
Western arts of peace.

528
00:52:27,704 --> 00:52:30,867
But China s greatest virtue
is her patience.

529
00:52:31,832 --> 00:52:35,435
If she exercises that now,
she will achieve everything.

530
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:37,211
And if not?

531
00:52:38,211 --> 00:52:39,252
If not,

532
00:52:39,963 --> 00:52:42,645
if violence
and impatience prevail,

533
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:45,742
the blood of millions
will be shed

534
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:47,691
and the agony be prolonged.

535
00:52:50,178 --> 00:52:52,300
Go to the window, Sir Arthur.

536
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,162
I’ve arranged something
for you to see.

537
00:53:30,039 --> 00:53:31,960
Please inform
your government

538
00:53:32,249 --> 00:53:35,131
that Chinese justice
is swift and thorough.

539
00:53:36,002 --> 00:53:39,645
Those men murdered the
German Minister this morning.

540
00:53:40,296 --> 00:53:41,777
Where lies the guilt?

541
00:53:42,464 --> 00:53:45,987
With he who wields the sword
or who gives the command?

542
00:53:46,717 --> 00:53:48,719
You know
who gave the command?

543
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:51,942
With your permission,
I d like to present

544
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:54,023
an eyewitness.

545
00:53:56,224 --> 00:53:57,465
By all means,

546
00:53:57,892 --> 00:53:59,013
Sir Arthur.

547
00:54:15,404 --> 00:54:16,925
Major Lewis, Your Majesty.

548
00:54:19,574 --> 00:54:21,776
Evidently, Major, you possess

549
00:54:22,074 --> 00:54:25,477
secret information
about the Boxer leadership.

550
00:54:27,411 --> 00:54:29,332
It s not much
of a secret.

551
00:54:30,081 --> 00:54:31,802
Please go on, Major Lewis.

552
00:54:32,374 --> 00:54:35,256
I saw the Boxer
commander this morning.

553
00:54:35,668 --> 00:54:37,950
The one who had
the Minister killed.

554
00:54:39,379 --> 00:54:40,380
You would know him?

555
00:54:43,466 --> 00:54:44,547
It was Prince Tuan.

556
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,241
You believe this story?

557
00:54:47,926 --> 00:54:49,047
I do, Your Majesty.

558
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:52,882
And you ask us to take
action against Prince Tuan?

559
00:54:53,555 --> 00:54:55,396
I’ve come here
with the truth

560
00:54:55,681 --> 00:54:59,364
now known by the German
government and the other Powers.

561
00:55:00,017 --> 00:55:03,100
We reject your truth.
And your protest.

562
00:55:03,728 --> 00:55:06,610
We are pleased
to inform you that Prince Tuan

563
00:55:06,939 --> 00:55:08,180
is our closest adviser.

564
00:55:08,774 --> 00:55:11,736
He now heads
the Foreign Office.

565
00:55:16,195 --> 00:55:19,198
For our part, Great Britain
wants nothing more

566
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:21,942
than continued
friendship with China.

567
00:55:23,034 --> 00:55:25,076
Because of the drought,

568
00:55:25,702 --> 00:55:28,504
the hunger and the unrest
among my people,

569
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:32,243
of the merciless demands
of the foreign powers,

570
00:55:33,165 --> 00:55:36,968
the situation in Peking cannot
be expected to become tranquil.

571
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:41,017
Therefore we
earnestly advise you

572
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:45,268
that all foreign residents,
including diplomatic personnel,

573
00:55:46,383 --> 00:55:49,946
should leave Peking
within twenty-four hours.

574
00:55:53,095 --> 00:55:55,016
Is Your Majesty informing me

575
00:55:55,306 --> 00:55:58,589
that she is severing
all diplomatic relations?

576
00:55:59,017 --> 00:56:00,098
Not at all.

577
00:56:01,227 --> 00:56:03,028
Her Majesty
was clear enough.

578
00:56:03,687 --> 00:56:07,370
She is offering informal
advice for your safety

579
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:08,651
and protection.

580
00:56:09,315 --> 00:56:11,397
- I am in favour of that.
- Major.

581
00:56:11,692 --> 00:56:14,855
She can't control the Boxers.
We d better get out.

582
00:56:15,195 --> 00:56:16,516
Prince Tuan,

583
00:56:17,697 --> 00:56:19,859
you will see
that these gentlemen

584
00:56:20,156 --> 00:56:23,239
are escorted safely
to their Legations.

585
00:56:24,827 --> 00:56:26,668
We d do better
on our own.

586
00:56:58,892 --> 00:57:01,494
- Do we walk?
- Yes, very slowly.

587
00:57:29,038 --> 00:57:30,119
Keep walking.

588
00:57:41,838 --> 00:57:42,959
Squad!

589
00:57:44,173 --> 00:57:45,294
Double time.

590
00:58:03,895 --> 00:58:06,537
- Thought you d need some help.
- Thank you.

591
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,601
Count the votes.

592
00:58:16,278 --> 00:58:18,199
We're awaiting
the American Minister.

593
00:58:18,863 --> 00:58:20,024
Oh, Mr. Maxwell.

594
00:58:21,532 --> 00:58:22,533
- Hello.
- Hello.

595
00:58:22,783 --> 00:58:24,384
Sorry to have
got you up,

596
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:26,931
but we need your vote,

597
00:58:27,453 --> 00:58:30,015
on staying in Peking or not.

598
00:58:32,455 --> 00:58:36,178
The United States have no
territorial concessions in China.

599
00:58:37,126 --> 00:58:39,087
Nor are we interested.

600
00:58:41,462 --> 00:58:43,624
I d better abstain, Sir Arthur.

601
00:58:44,256 --> 00:58:45,577
I understand, Mr. Maxwell.

602
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:48,122
I just wanted you to be here.

603
00:58:51,845 --> 00:58:54,848
Congratulations, gentlemen.
It's unanimous.

604
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:58,212
Nine votes
in favour of evacuation.

605
00:58:59,809 --> 00:59:02,731
Great Britain
has decided to stay.

606
00:59:03,144 --> 00:59:04,665
Alone if necessary.

607
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:06,591
That s not possible.

608
00:59:06,939 --> 00:59:08,660
We d look ridiculous

609
00:59:08,939 --> 00:59:11,541
if we left
the British alone in Peking.

610
00:59:12,859 --> 00:59:15,181
Perhaps Britain
has its reasons

611
00:59:15,486 --> 00:59:18,368
for being the only
foreign power in Peking.

612
00:59:18,947 --> 00:59:20,508
Our friend is right.

613
00:59:20,782 --> 00:59:22,703
They may have
secret reports.

614
00:59:23,324 --> 00:59:25,486
I’ve made it
completely clear.

615
00:59:25,785 --> 00:59:27,626
Admiral Sydney
is on his way

616
00:59:27,912 --> 00:59:29,914
with several thousand men.

617
00:59:30,204 --> 00:59:32,646
He’ll be here
in 9 or 10 days.

618
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:36,342
Meanwhile, I refuse
to worry about

619
00:59:36,667 --> 00:59:39,910
the Boxers giving
a victory to Prince Tuan.

620
00:59:40,337 --> 00:59:42,138
Then the Germans stay too.

621
00:59:42,796 --> 00:59:43,716
Sir Arthur,

622
00:59:45,339 --> 00:59:48,342
we Spaniards
fulfill our obligations.

623
00:59:48,676 --> 00:59:51,558
There s no word for
flight in our dictionary.

624
00:59:53,595 --> 00:59:57,558
We feel obliged to protect
the civilians who depend on us.

625
00:59:58,182 --> 01:00:00,464
I recognize
that obligation, Guzmán,

626
01:00:00,767 --> 01:00:03,329
and I believe
that if we stand united

627
01:00:03,769 --> 01:00:05,891
the Chinese
won't dare to attack

628
01:00:06,188 --> 01:00:08,910
the representatives
of 11 great Powers.

629
01:00:09,273 --> 01:00:10,474
If we stand firm,

630
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:14,592
there'll be peace in China
and in the whole world.

631
01:00:16,069 --> 01:00:17,510
Spain is with you.

632
01:00:17,988 --> 01:00:19,909
If the other Powers stay,

633
01:00:20,198 --> 01:00:21,879
so will Austria.

634
01:00:24,117 --> 01:00:27,039
Congratulations, Sir Arthur.
The British win

635
01:00:27,369 --> 01:00:28,730
another bloodless victory.

636
01:00:28,995 --> 01:00:32,118
I take it You’ve
unanimously decided to stay?

637
01:00:32,456 --> 01:00:35,739
I shall report that
the first vote was9 to 1

638
01:00:36,083 --> 01:00:39,486
and that in a friendly spirit
it was then decided

639
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:41,878
to make
the decision unanimous.

640
01:00:42,670 --> 01:00:46,073
Well, then I suggest
we call in the military.

641
01:00:50,968 --> 01:00:52,129
This way, gentlemen.

642
01:00:58,558 --> 01:01:00,720
Colonel Shiba
will give the report.

643
01:01:03,435 --> 01:01:05,797
As to the military aspects,

644
01:01:06,103 --> 01:01:09,146
we have agreed that
with fewer than 400 men,

645
01:01:09,481 --> 01:01:11,362
to defend
a 2-mile perimeter,

646
01:01:11,649 --> 01:01:13,370
the position is untenable.

647
01:01:14,735 --> 01:01:16,937
We recommend
immediate evacuation.

648
01:01:19,655 --> 01:01:23,218
For political reasons the
Ministers say we must remain.

649
01:01:23,866 --> 01:01:27,349
So you must defend
the area until Admiral Sydney s

650
01:01:27,703 --> 01:01:28,824
forces arrive.

651
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:32,373
Sir, what if the relief
column doesn’t make it?

652
01:01:32,915 --> 01:01:35,998
It s over 70 miles
through hostile territory.

653
01:01:36,708 --> 01:01:39,831
We’ll consider
that situation when it arises.

654
01:01:40,544 --> 01:01:42,305
We have 5 defense sectors.

655
01:01:42,587 --> 01:01:45,549
The wall defended
by the Germans and Americans,

656
01:01:45,882 --> 01:01:48,484
the west end,
the British Legation,

657
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,762
the Fu, held by
the Americans and Japanese,

658
01:01:52,470 --> 01:01:56,233
and the east end, held
by the Italians and French.

659
01:02:04,436 --> 01:02:05,837
- Boxers?
- Yes.

660
01:02:06,145 --> 01:02:09,388
- Where the hell are they?
- All around us.

661
01:02:09,731 --> 01:02:12,013
Their purpose is
to make us nervous.

662
01:02:12,317 --> 01:02:16,040
Once the shooting starts You’ll
see them outside that wall.

663
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:19,191
Who's nervous?

664
01:02:23,366 --> 01:02:24,126
No!

665
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:26,391
You cant have them!

666
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:28,193
But Sarah, we agreed.

667
01:02:28,744 --> 01:02:32,147
We need the books
for barricades.

668
01:02:32,497 --> 01:02:35,099
Not the Set of
the Napoleonic Wars.

669
01:02:35,499 --> 01:02:37,861
Mother sent them
for your birthday.

670
01:02:38,167 --> 01:02:40,929
I must confess
that French history bores me.

671
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:47,551
English history? Bah!

672
01:03:48,758 --> 01:03:52,441
- Go away. The shop is closed.
- It s Baroness Ivanoff.

673
01:03:58,598 --> 01:04:01,360
I thought all Peking's
doors were closed to me,

674
01:04:01,726 --> 01:04:04,208
that I d lost face
in the Chinese streets.

675
01:04:04,518 --> 01:04:08,161
Our Empress has
those same fears, Baroness.

676
01:04:09,023 --> 01:04:10,104
The Boxers.

677
01:04:11,065 --> 01:04:12,386
It is hoped

678
01:04:13,067 --> 01:04:16,029
her wisdom will prevail.

679
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:20,451
I got your message, old one.

680
01:04:23,032 --> 01:04:25,754
Your friend thinks
you should leave Peking.

681
01:04:27,868 --> 01:04:30,911
- Which friend, old one?
- General Jung-Lu.

682
01:04:32,787 --> 01:04:34,789
It was not possible before.

683
01:04:35,207 --> 01:04:37,048
We would have been accused

684
01:04:37,333 --> 01:04:39,815
of meddling in
Russian affairs.

685
01:04:40,127 --> 01:04:41,087
And now?

686
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:42,676
Now...

687
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:45,157
it makes no difference.

688
01:04:45,755 --> 01:04:47,396
The Boxers will attack.

689
01:04:47,674 --> 01:04:50,596
If you disappear
in the confusion who d be left

690
01:04:50,926 --> 01:04:52,127
to point a finger?

691
01:04:53,052 --> 01:04:56,575
At 5 p. m. the fighting
will have begun.

692
01:04:57,389 --> 01:05:00,992
You’ll meet a man at the corner
of the French Legation.

693
01:05:02,184 --> 01:05:04,866
He’ll be wearing
a green peasant jacket.

694
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:07,311
You will be there?

695
01:05:19,529 --> 01:05:22,812
- Go up on the ramp and take a look.
- Yes, sir.

696
01:05:26,951 --> 01:05:29,273
- I don’t like this.
- Don’t worry.

697
01:05:31,036 --> 01:05:33,798
Tell those men
to get their backs into it.

698
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:40,501
Whoa there.

699
01:05:46,548 --> 01:05:49,551
- Where are you going?
- I’m getting out of Peking.

700
01:05:49,884 --> 01:05:51,926
Those Boxers
out there are angry.

701
01:05:52,469 --> 01:05:55,111
- Not with me.
- We have 200 rounds each.

702
01:05:56,096 --> 01:05:59,299
- That s 20 per man per day.
- Enough for warming up.

703
01:05:59,641 --> 01:06:01,643
They d better start out warm.

704
01:06:01,933 --> 01:06:03,534
Yes, sir.
I’ll tell them.

705
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:08,041
Get out
before I get mad!

706
01:06:08,313 --> 01:06:12,196
Mad Americans inside, mad Boxers
outside, mad Russians there...

707
01:06:12,565 --> 01:06:13,966
I’ll risk going out.

708
01:06:14,901 --> 01:06:18,664
I split the men in 2
platoons. 4 hours on, 4 hours off.

709
01:06:19,071 --> 01:06:21,793
The sergeant will take
the first watch.

710
01:06:22,113 --> 01:06:23,033
Right.

711
01:06:25,491 --> 01:06:28,814
I wanted to go to Tientsin
but you prefer to stay.

712
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:31,722
I wear a uniform.
They pay me for that.

713
01:06:32,246 --> 01:06:33,567
Go on then.

714
01:06:33,831 --> 01:06:35,352
And get out of my way.

715
01:06:36,707 --> 01:06:38,548
Have a nice war, soldier,

716
01:06:39,084 --> 01:06:40,445
a real nice war.

717
01:06:44,171 --> 01:06:45,412
Where do these go?

718
01:06:46,005 --> 01:06:48,807
Where do you think?
Get up on that wall!

719
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,040
Fire!

720
01:08:49,455 --> 01:08:50,535
Fire!

721
01:08:57,125 --> 01:08:58,165
Let s go!

722
01:09:06,631 --> 01:09:08,031
Forward!

723
01:09:09,216 --> 01:09:10,776
Forward!

724
01:09:29,355 --> 01:09:32,156
- Cease firing.
- Cease firing.

725
01:09:32,732 --> 01:09:34,492
We did it!
We beat them!

726
01:09:35,234 --> 01:09:37,074
What if they come back?

727
01:09:37,861 --> 01:09:40,141
We’ve used
over half our ammunition.

728
01:09:40,945 --> 01:09:42,785
Are you good
with a slingshot?

729
01:09:56,496 --> 01:09:57,976
A friend of yours?

730
01:10:16,052 --> 01:10:16,972
Soldier.

731
01:10:17,345 --> 01:10:20,786
- Can you open the door?
- You cant go through, ma'am.

732
01:10:28,602 --> 01:10:29,802
That was bad luck.

733
01:10:32,604 --> 01:10:35,245
- I’ll be all right.
- I’ll be right back.

734
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:52,311
- What do you make of her?
- This is quite a weapon.

735
01:10:53,035 --> 01:10:55,115
What would you call it?

736
01:10:55,661 --> 01:10:58,742
Across between
an alligator and an ostrich.

737
01:10:59,123 --> 01:11:01,764
We call her Betsy
after the Empress.

738
01:11:02,084 --> 01:11:05,085
It s an old German barrel
with Russian shells

739
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:07,900
of approximately
the same caliber.

740
01:11:08,253 --> 01:11:10,974
The carriage is Italian,
the wheels French,

741
01:11:11,298 --> 01:11:14,099
and that boy's
fool enough to fire it.

742
01:11:14,424 --> 01:11:17,225
Would it be safer
in front or in back?

743
01:11:17,970 --> 01:11:21,091
The point is where is
Betsy going to be fired?

744
01:11:21,470 --> 01:11:24,191
-Major...
- Please, gentlemen.

745
01:11:26,182 --> 01:11:27,902
- Captain Marshall...
- What's up?

746
01:11:28,224 --> 01:11:30,384
The Chinese
are on top of the wall.

747
01:11:30,810 --> 01:11:33,851
- Now we know where Betsy goes.
- You! Over here!

748
01:11:35,145 --> 01:11:37,425
Come on, bring it along.

749
01:11:50,947 --> 01:11:51,787
Run!

750
01:11:53,241 --> 01:11:54,641
Cone on, Andy, run!

751
01:11:55,368 --> 01:11:57,168
Sergeant, get in.
Take cover.

752
01:12:02,873 --> 01:12:03,713
Damn it!

753
01:12:05,251 --> 01:12:06,451
What happened?

754
01:12:07,544 --> 01:12:10,625
We tried but they re too many.
They keep coming.

755
01:12:11,002 --> 01:12:11,882
Major.

756
01:12:36,228 --> 01:12:39,149
- How many did we lose?
- Turner and Spencer.

757
01:12:39,521 --> 01:12:42,522
5 wounded.
The Germans got it even worse.

758
01:12:48,486 --> 01:12:50,726
Why don’t they
rush us right now?

759
01:12:52,030 --> 01:12:53,830
We wouldn’t stand a chance.

760
01:12:54,657 --> 01:12:57,618
Maybe they think
We’ve got millions of men.

761
01:12:57,950 --> 01:13:00,310
Come morning
they'll think different.

762
01:13:01,621 --> 01:13:05,102
They’ll roll down
those ramps like Niagara Falls.

763
01:13:06,248 --> 01:13:08,168
We must get them
off this wall...

764
01:13:08,623 --> 01:13:09,583
We can t.

765
01:13:12,627 --> 01:13:15,107
Or They’ll shoot
into the Legation area.

766
01:13:15,464 --> 01:13:17,384
Like fish in a barrel.

767
01:13:17,716 --> 01:13:21,077
We might just as well
open the gates and let them in.

768
01:13:21,634 --> 01:13:23,874
Take the French priest
to the Legation.

769
01:13:24,219 --> 01:13:25,099
Right.

770
01:13:30,596 --> 01:13:31,916
They wont start

771
01:13:32,181 --> 01:13:33,501
up here till morning.

772
01:13:35,726 --> 01:13:37,406
Just hope they don’t.

773
01:14:16,085 --> 01:14:18,525
- No sign of activity?
- No, sir.

774
01:14:18,878 --> 01:14:20,078
They're all asleep.

775
01:14:21,841 --> 01:14:24,001
Well, we'd better not be.

776
01:14:24,591 --> 01:14:27,031
- Better wake them all up.
- Yes, sir.

777
01:14:30,596 --> 01:14:31,516
Wake up.

778
01:14:33,597 --> 01:14:34,637
Good morning.

779
01:14:37,017 --> 01:14:38,617
Good morning.

780
01:14:40,768 --> 01:14:41,768
Good morning.

781
01:14:46,564 --> 01:14:47,484
Good morning.

782
01:14:48,022 --> 01:14:48,902
Good morning.

783
01:14:51,861 --> 01:14:53,021
Here they come!

784
01:16:37,553 --> 01:16:39,233
Keep rolling!
Keep rolling!

785
01:17:25,295 --> 01:17:26,855
Andy, get down.

786
01:17:37,718 --> 01:17:40,279
Major, what
are we doing here?

787
01:17:40,596 --> 01:17:43,076
- Why didn’t we get out?
- I don’t know.

788
01:17:44,766 --> 01:17:46,166
I really don’t know.

789
01:17:52,102 --> 01:17:54,502
Handley told me
you re-took the wall.

790
01:17:55,354 --> 01:17:57,995
I suppose you heard...
He died too.

791
01:18:00,317 --> 01:18:02,157
The Minister
can tell us why.

792
01:18:02,485 --> 01:18:05,566
And Marshall, too.
He has all the answers.

793
01:18:06,113 --> 01:18:07,353
That s all, sergeant.

794
01:18:07,904 --> 01:18:08,864
Get on back.

795
01:18:15,412 --> 01:18:16,812
He s a good soldier.

796
01:18:17,079 --> 01:18:18,879
When he knows
why he’s fighting.

797
01:18:19,328 --> 01:18:21,448
When it s
something you can see...

798
01:18:21,788 --> 01:18:23,868
a wall, a hill,
a river, it s easier.

799
01:18:24,456 --> 01:18:27,657
But how can you explain
it s for a principle?

800
01:18:30,586 --> 01:18:31,666
You cant.

801
01:18:33,631 --> 01:18:34,951
Not here in China.

802
01:18:36,133 --> 01:18:37,453
It s too far from home.

803
01:18:39,175 --> 01:18:40,055
I know.

804
01:18:52,308 --> 01:18:53,348
I wont stay.

805
01:18:54,102 --> 01:18:54,902
No!

806
01:18:56,020 --> 01:18:56,940
I won t stay!

807
01:18:57,437 --> 01:18:58,317
Don’t let...

808
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,120
Don’t let them take my leg.

809
01:19:02,025 --> 01:19:02,945
Tell them...

810
01:19:03,356 --> 01:19:04,516
Tell them not to...

811
01:19:05,859 --> 01:19:06,939
Please!

812
01:19:07,485 --> 01:19:08,205
Please!

813
01:19:08,654 --> 01:19:11,215
- Tell them!
- There, there.

814
01:19:11,572 --> 01:19:14,293
I don’t want
to live like half a man.

815
01:19:22,078 --> 01:19:23,238
He s only fainted.

816
01:19:30,626 --> 01:19:31,746
You can go now.

817
01:19:32,377 --> 01:19:33,417
Can you save his leg?

818
01:19:40,341 --> 01:19:41,661
May I stay with him?

819
01:19:43,802 --> 01:19:47,283
Your dress is
a breeding-ground for germs.

820
01:19:50,931 --> 01:19:52,491
What re you waiting for?

821
01:19:54,184 --> 01:19:56,024
Take it off
and put on a uniform.

822
01:19:59,812 --> 01:20:01,012
Thank you, doctor.

823
01:20:16,072 --> 01:20:17,152
Who'll tell her?

824
01:20:20,035 --> 01:20:21,875
The captain s little girl.

825
01:20:30,290 --> 01:20:32,170
It s pretty late now.

826
01:20:33,668 --> 01:20:35,308
Tell her in the morning.

827
01:20:35,586 --> 01:20:38,667
But she might hear
about it from somebody else.

828
01:20:40,838 --> 01:20:41,998
I guess not.

829
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:49,136
- Let s get a drink first.
- No, later.

830
01:20:56,559 --> 01:20:57,479
Coming?

831
01:21:00,476 --> 01:21:02,396
- I’m going back to the wall.
- Wait.

832
01:21:07,399 --> 01:21:08,359
All right.

833
01:21:10,609 --> 01:21:11,809
Where'll I find her?

834
01:21:12,819 --> 01:21:14,859
With the orphans in the Fu.

835
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:21,280
How do I tell her?

836
01:21:23,284 --> 01:21:25,284
Like she was
your own, I guess.

837
01:21:26,911 --> 01:21:29,472
Like someone
telling your own kid.

838
01:21:46,673 --> 01:21:48,953
- Do you know which one she is?
- No.

839
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:51,740
So many new children
came in today.

840
01:21:52,177 --> 01:21:53,497
Haven’t you met her?

841
01:21:54,222 --> 01:21:55,222
Just once.

842
01:21:56,013 --> 01:21:57,973
I cant remember
what she s like.

843
01:21:58,392 --> 01:21:59,952
I didn’t pay much attention.

844
01:22:01,227 --> 01:22:02,267
Major Lewis.

845
01:22:04,102 --> 01:22:06,502
We re looking for
the Marshall girl.

846
01:22:06,979 --> 01:22:10,060
Ah, of course.
Yes, Teresa... I heard.

847
01:22:13,775 --> 01:22:16,336
I guess she must
be sleeping, eh?

848
01:22:18,110 --> 01:22:19,990
Please tell her
in the morning.

849
01:22:20,362 --> 01:22:22,562
It s important
you tell her, Major.

850
01:22:22,991 --> 01:22:25,552
She knows you were
her father s friend.

851
01:22:26,532 --> 01:22:27,652
I'll wake her.

852
01:22:33,245 --> 01:22:34,405
Here she is.

853
01:22:34,706 --> 01:22:37,066
A friend of your father's
to see you.

854
01:22:40,210 --> 01:22:41,090
Teresa...

855
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:44,300
You...

856
01:22:46,257 --> 01:22:48,898
- Do you remember me?
- Yes, Major.

857
01:22:50,173 --> 01:22:52,013
I have something to tell you.

858
01:22:53,678 --> 01:22:56,399
Why don’t the two of you
stay here and talk?

859
01:23:16,443 --> 01:23:18,763
You know
there s been some fighting?

860
01:23:23,906 --> 01:23:24,826
Well,

861
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:29,079
I have something to tell you.

862
01:23:31,867 --> 01:23:33,267
Is it about my father?

863
01:23:36,078 --> 01:23:36,878
Yes.

864
01:23:43,125 --> 01:23:44,205
Is he... dead?

865
01:23:45,837 --> 01:23:46,877
Did you know?

866
01:23:55,343 --> 01:23:56,223
Well...

867
01:24:00,637 --> 01:24:02,037
you knew
he was a soldier.

868
01:24:02,681 --> 01:24:04,441
It could happen at any time.

869
01:24:10,392 --> 01:24:11,472
You’ll be taken care of.

870
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:14,400
You won't have to worry.

871
01:24:30,574 --> 01:24:31,534
Well,

872
01:24:35,661 --> 01:24:37,421
You’ll be
all right now, huh?

873
01:24:40,165 --> 01:24:42,165
Wont I be going home then?

874
01:24:43,791 --> 01:24:44,711
Home?

875
01:24:50,045 --> 01:24:52,525
To America.
He said he d take me home.

876
01:24:58,593 --> 01:24:59,553
He did?

877
01:25:11,141 --> 01:25:12,061
When?

878
01:25:13,393 --> 01:25:14,473
Every time.

879
01:25:15,311 --> 01:25:16,511
And just today again.

880
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:37,660
Well...

881
01:25:41,746 --> 01:25:43,466
I don't think
you d like it.

882
01:25:50,209 --> 01:25:51,529
Everything's

883
01:25:53,087 --> 01:25:54,407
very strange.

884
01:25:56,630 --> 01:25:59,110
Things are all different.
The people,

885
01:26:00,131 --> 01:26:03,652
and the food,
the houses, the schools.

886
01:26:10,973 --> 01:26:14,134
If you want, we can talk
some more in a few days,

887
01:26:15,851 --> 01:26:19,172
when things quiet down.

888
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:37,072
I promise.

889
01:26:44,579 --> 01:26:45,579
All right.

890
01:26:54,792 --> 01:26:55,672
Bye.

891
01:27:10,554 --> 01:27:11,754
Think she understood?

892
01:27:15,474 --> 01:27:18,515
When a mother dies,
a child feels deserted.

893
01:27:19,601 --> 01:27:22,041
When a father goes away,

894
01:27:22,395 --> 01:27:24,035
a child feels abandoned.

895
01:27:25,105 --> 01:27:28,906
She s had more than her fair
share. She understands too well.

896
01:27:30,983 --> 01:27:33,183
What else
could I have told her?

897
01:27:35,445 --> 01:27:38,086
A child understands
only one language...

898
01:27:39,865 --> 01:27:40,865
love.

899
01:27:45,203 --> 01:27:47,163
Well, she isn’t mine.

900
01:27:48,872 --> 01:27:51,152
They say that
every man is the father

901
01:27:51,499 --> 01:27:53,299
of every child.

902
01:27:55,293 --> 01:27:56,853
I suppose
it's only true

903
01:27:58,002 --> 01:27:59,842
if you really feel it.

904
01:30:36,003 --> 01:30:38,363
The British Admiral
and his forces

905
01:30:38,711 --> 01:30:41,471
are trapped between
Langfang and Anping.

906
01:30:42,628 --> 01:30:45,788
The Boxers do not climb
a tree to look for a fish.

907
01:30:46,672 --> 01:30:48,512
They have done
their work well.

908
01:30:49,171 --> 01:30:51,611
The railway is destroyed.

909
01:30:52,755 --> 01:30:55,435
He can neither
proceed nor retreat.

910
01:30:56,840 --> 01:31:00,641
You see, the Boxers are not
as useless as you believed.

911
01:31:25,134 --> 01:31:27,574
It does not
require courage or skill

912
01:31:27,926 --> 01:31:30,166
to rip up
a few rails.

913
01:31:30,593 --> 01:31:32,313
The Boxers
flee the foreigners.

914
01:31:34,178 --> 01:31:36,498
If Sydney cannot
use the railway,

915
01:31:36,803 --> 01:31:38,643
he will now
march on Peking.

916
01:31:39,386 --> 01:31:41,306
I expect him
within the week.

917
01:31:42,511 --> 01:31:43,671
It is true.

918
01:31:43,968 --> 01:31:46,488
The Boxers cannot
stop such a force.

919
01:31:48,513 --> 01:31:51,993
Only General Jung-Lu's
Imperial troops can do that.

920
01:31:52,472 --> 01:31:54,792
They have no part
in this uprising.

921
01:31:55,806 --> 01:31:58,566
The troops will do
as Her Majesty commands.

922
01:31:59,305 --> 01:32:01,905
Who can make
muddy water clear?

923
01:32:03,764 --> 01:32:04,324
Your Majesty,

924
01:32:05,597 --> 01:32:07,277
first they said the Boxers

925
01:32:07,555 --> 01:32:10,275
would destroy
the foreigners in two days.

926
01:32:10,806 --> 01:32:14,647
Next that no foreign army
would even approach the city.

927
01:32:16,181 --> 01:32:19,661
If we commit the
Imperial Army against Sydney,

928
01:32:20,308 --> 01:32:23,348
we shall be declaring
waron all the Powers.

929
01:32:25,099 --> 01:32:27,579
Our armies,
for all their courage,

930
01:32:27,892 --> 01:32:30,012
could not
win such a war.

931
01:32:30,476 --> 01:32:32,676
The Boxers
have created an opportunity

932
01:32:32,977 --> 01:32:34,937
for a great
Chinese victory.

933
01:32:35,267 --> 01:32:37,427
If our troops
destroy their forces,

934
01:32:38,018 --> 01:32:40,978
it will prove that China
is no longer helpless,

935
01:32:41,394 --> 01:32:43,274
and be
the beginning of freedom.

936
01:32:44,436 --> 01:32:47,116
Each speaks with
the voice of a patriot.

937
01:32:48,061 --> 01:32:51,101
Prince Tuan counsels
a reckless adventure,

938
01:32:52,188 --> 01:32:55,348
General Jung-Lu counsels
prudence and patience.

939
01:32:58,146 --> 01:33:00,266
Prudence and patience for what?

940
01:33:01,686 --> 01:33:04,246
China's condition
can be no worse.

941
01:33:04,562 --> 01:33:06,922
Even if we start
a war and lose it,

942
01:33:07,314 --> 01:33:09,314
what more can
the powers take?

943
01:33:10,022 --> 01:33:11,222
General Jung-Lu,

944
01:33:12,105 --> 01:33:14,145
you will command our troops

945
01:33:15,232 --> 01:33:17,352
and turn back
the foreign armies.

946
01:33:31,274 --> 01:33:32,434
Stop it, Tommy.

947
01:33:33,191 --> 01:33:36,671
- You’ll wake the baby.
- You can t talk. You re dead.

948
01:33:47,403 --> 01:33:48,803
Don’t play
at that end.

949
01:33:50,902 --> 01:33:51,982
Oh, Tommy!

950
01:34:06,905 --> 01:34:07,745
Tommy!

951
01:34:11,112 --> 01:34:12,792
Mummy! Mummy!

952
01:34:48,992 --> 01:34:51,432
He’ll die
without going home.

953
01:34:53,035 --> 01:34:55,315
Funny how he used
to talk about home,

954
01:34:56,410 --> 01:34:58,450
as if he remembered
how it was.

955
01:34:59,411 --> 01:35:01,731
As if he’d
actually been there.

956
01:35:03,203 --> 01:35:04,163
Arthur.

957
01:35:05,496 --> 01:35:07,336
He used to ask me about it.

958
01:35:08,744 --> 01:35:10,984
He mustn't die. Poor Tommy.

959
01:35:11,661 --> 01:35:13,741
Yes, and poor us too.

960
01:35:14,537 --> 01:35:15,537
Arthur.

961
01:35:16,204 --> 01:35:18,964
I’ve the strangest feeling.

962
01:35:19,328 --> 01:35:20,368
What is it?

963
01:35:23,873 --> 01:35:27,073
Do you think if a child dies
without going home,

964
01:35:27,414 --> 01:35:28,894
that his soul
doesn’t rest?

965
01:35:31,457 --> 01:35:33,137
I think
it goes into limbo.

966
01:35:35,623 --> 01:35:38,543
An enormous,
empty Chinese limbo,

967
01:35:40,165 --> 01:35:42,165
wandering there,
lost and crying.

968
01:35:42,499 --> 01:35:44,619
- He’s fine.
- Why doesn’t he wake up?

969
01:35:44,957 --> 01:35:47,597
The doctor says
he s in a coma.

970
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,880
It may last several days.

971
01:35:50,333 --> 01:35:52,373
He may not
come round at all...

972
01:35:52,791 --> 01:35:54,431
He may never
come round.

973
01:35:55,959 --> 01:35:57,399
Why? Why?

974
01:35:58,127 --> 01:36:00,367
How did he sin?
Against whom?

975
01:36:02,001 --> 01:36:04,241
What s he doing
in this foreign place?

976
01:36:06,502 --> 01:36:08,662
Whose ambition
is he serving?

977
01:36:10,794 --> 01:36:14,675
Must a child die
to serve the ends of ambition?

978
01:36:17,296 --> 01:36:18,896
Who d gain
from his death?

979
01:36:19,211 --> 01:36:20,731
Who'd be
the happier for it?

980
01:36:22,254 --> 01:36:24,254
How many children must die,

981
01:36:25,129 --> 01:36:28,209
how many people suffer,
before there is an end?

982
01:36:29,255 --> 01:36:31,895
A child s life
is too high a price to pay.

983
01:36:32,255 --> 01:36:34,055
I cant stand it!

984
01:36:34,757 --> 01:36:36,197
I cant stand it!

985
01:36:36,963 --> 01:36:40,604
- Sarah, try to understand
- Understand what? Tell me!

986
01:36:41,506 --> 01:36:43,106
- Tell me!
- I feel the pain too.

987
01:36:45,674 --> 01:36:47,834
Have you ever
been to England?

988
01:36:49,591 --> 01:36:50,391
Yes.

989
01:36:51,091 --> 01:36:52,211
Manchester?

990
01:36:54,674 --> 01:36:55,554
No.

991
01:36:56,633 --> 01:36:58,033
Is it a beautiful city?

992
01:37:01,385 --> 01:37:03,185
I wouldn’t
call it beautiful.

993
01:37:04,049 --> 01:37:04,809
But,

994
01:37:05,468 --> 01:37:08,348
you know how it is,
coming from a far place.

995
01:37:11,719 --> 01:37:12,879
Go to sleep now.

996
01:37:14,052 --> 01:37:17,412
Dream of Manchester.
It would be like a visit home.

997
01:37:21,595 --> 01:37:24,315
Litnoff is
the Tsarina s second cousin.

998
01:37:25,386 --> 01:37:27,146
You cannot treat him

999
01:37:27,471 --> 01:37:28,671
like a common soldier.

1000
01:37:28,928 --> 01:37:29,728
The bullet

1001
01:37:29,970 --> 01:37:32,490
wasn’t afraid
of wounding a Count.

1002
01:37:33,055 --> 01:37:36,055
Germs wont care
if he s her first cousin.

1003
01:37:36,929 --> 01:37:39,569
He’ll be treated
like any other man here.

1004
01:37:41,014 --> 01:37:42,134
Good day, Baron.

1005
01:37:49,474 --> 01:37:50,594
I understand

1006
01:37:50,890 --> 01:37:53,210
you are here
early and late.

1007
01:37:55,849 --> 01:37:57,569
A true angel of mercy.

1008
01:38:00,014 --> 01:38:01,774
- The men won t be...
- Quiet!

1009
01:38:02,641 --> 01:38:04,161
...nursed by anyone else.

1010
01:38:08,185 --> 01:38:10,625
I've always
had a way with men.

1011
01:38:11,183 --> 01:38:13,223
Even with
the German doctor.

1012
01:38:13,808 --> 01:38:15,168
He can t do without me.

1013
01:38:15,810 --> 01:38:16,930
And the Major?

1014
01:38:18,518 --> 01:38:19,438
The American?

1015
01:38:22,310 --> 01:38:23,270
What do you want?

1016
01:38:28,811 --> 01:38:30,491
I d like to be present

1017
01:38:30,852 --> 01:38:32,772
when he finds out
what you are.

1018
01:38:33,728 --> 01:38:34,768
You’ll be present.

1019
01:38:36,104 --> 01:38:39,384
You’ll tell him. You're
just waiting for the moment.

1020
01:38:53,690 --> 01:38:54,930
Where is it?

1021
01:38:55,481 --> 01:38:56,281
Right here.

1022
01:39:30,277 --> 01:39:31,237
Open the door.

1023
01:39:37,446 --> 01:39:40,966
Hello, Sir Arthur.
A message from Admiral Sydney.

1024
01:39:41,319 --> 01:39:43,399
Welcome, Reverend Michaelson.

1025
01:39:43,945 --> 01:39:45,345
Heavens.

1026
01:39:46,154 --> 01:39:48,514
Where is it?
I hope I haven t lost it.

1027
01:39:48,862 --> 01:39:52,503
- Where did you see the admiral?
- Here it is.

1028
01:39:58,529 --> 01:40:01,169
We’ll have to decode it.
Come with me.

1029
01:40:03,573 --> 01:40:07,214
With a column
of 2,200 men

1030
01:40:07,615 --> 01:40:10,495
we came
by rail to Anping,

1031
01:40:11,033 --> 01:40:12,753
where we were driven back

1032
01:40:13,075 --> 01:40:16,595
by a large contingent
of Chinese Imperial forces.

1033
01:40:19,617 --> 01:40:23,258
Our troops were decimated
and we lost a huge amount

1034
01:40:23,659 --> 01:40:24,619
of equipment.

1035
01:40:25,075 --> 01:40:27,355
'It is impossible
to march on Peking,

1036
01:40:27,701 --> 01:40:30,301
so we must
fall back to Tientsin,'

1037
01:40:30,659 --> 01:40:32,619
along the River Peigei.

1038
01:40:33,577 --> 01:40:37,298
- 'Signed, Harold Sydney'.
- Is there nothing more?

1039
01:40:37,704 --> 01:40:40,784
- What shall we do now?
- What shall we do?

1040
01:40:59,621 --> 01:41:01,061
You've eaten nothing.

1041
01:41:01,454 --> 01:41:04,334
- Have something now.
- Thank you, Sarah.

1042
01:41:06,748 --> 01:41:07,668
Need more light?

1043
01:41:08,415 --> 01:41:09,375
No, thank you.

1044
01:41:10,914 --> 01:41:14,154
You asked me
why we were here.

1045
01:41:14,958 --> 01:41:16,838
Why we hadn’t left.

1046
01:41:17,415 --> 01:41:19,495
I’m sorry.
I shouldn’t have.

1047
01:41:20,581 --> 01:41:23,181
Sometimes it s
good to wonder why.

1048
01:41:23,790 --> 01:41:26,510
These last few hours
it s all I’ve done.

1049
01:41:27,958 --> 01:41:28,998
What about?

1050
01:41:32,125 --> 01:41:33,085
First,

1051
01:41:33,459 --> 01:41:34,579
Who am I?'

1052
01:41:35,917 --> 01:41:36,877
Second,

1053
01:41:37,377 --> 01:41:40,417
What have I achieved
in 20 years of diplomacy?'

1054
01:41:41,752 --> 01:41:42,712
Third,

1055
01:41:43,253 --> 01:41:45,213
Am I a good diplomat,

1056
01:41:46,003 --> 01:41:47,083
or a failure,

1057
01:41:47,378 --> 01:41:50,458
only fit for
a minor post in Peking?

1058
01:41:51,796 --> 01:41:52,756
Fourth,

1059
01:41:53,504 --> 01:41:56,584
Have I honestly tried
to avoid war with China,'

1060
01:41:58,086 --> 01:42:01,406
or have I only tried
to make a name for myself?

1061
01:42:03,253 --> 01:42:04,173
Fifth,

1062
01:42:04,879 --> 01:42:07,719
Am I a fool
in search of adventure,

1063
01:42:08,755 --> 01:42:10,355
or a sensible man'

1064
01:42:11,256 --> 01:42:13,136
who s taken a risk?

1065
01:42:15,923 --> 01:42:17,563
What kind
of father am I

1066
01:42:17,882 --> 01:42:20,162
to put my family s
lives in danger?

1067
01:42:21,632 --> 01:42:22,792
Am I acting like

1068
01:42:23,298 --> 01:42:26,698
some god playing
with the fate or others?

1069
01:42:28,132 --> 01:42:31,252
I've been with you
since you started your career.

1070
01:42:32,716 --> 01:42:34,836
I know what
You’ve been through

1071
01:42:35,967 --> 01:42:37,407
and I know you well.

1072
01:42:39,091 --> 01:42:41,571
Only an honourable man
says such things.

1073
01:43:07,387 --> 01:43:09,827
- Excellency.
- I was just leaving, Major.

1074
01:43:10,596 --> 01:43:12,956
We were talking
about the good times.

1075
01:43:15,263 --> 01:43:16,383
Don’t go.

1076
01:43:20,348 --> 01:43:22,188
My brother-in-law is eager

1077
01:43:24,015 --> 01:43:25,295
to tell you something.

1078
01:43:25,847 --> 01:43:28,527
This is a family matter.
Don’t discuss it

1079
01:43:28,848 --> 01:43:31,088
- before strangers.
- Don’t play games.

1080
01:43:31,431 --> 01:43:32,791
Get it over with now.

1081
01:43:36,349 --> 01:43:39,669
We were talking about
my dead brother, her husband.

1082
01:43:40,016 --> 01:43:41,336
I'm not interested.

1083
01:43:42,476 --> 01:43:45,076
How do you suppose he was?
Like me?

1084
01:43:45,391 --> 01:43:47,151
Fat, past middle age?

1085
01:43:47,476 --> 01:43:48,396
Something like that.

1086
01:43:49,977 --> 01:43:52,137
The youngest Colonel
in our army.

1087
01:43:52,517 --> 01:43:54,157
With a brilliant future.

1088
01:43:54,602 --> 01:43:56,962
The Tsar himself
had taken notice...

1089
01:43:58,685 --> 01:44:00,325
Do you know
why he died?

1090
01:44:01,644 --> 01:44:02,364
No.

1091
01:44:05,812 --> 01:44:06,572
Go on.

1092
01:44:07,603 --> 01:44:09,443
I cant...
It suddenly seems...

1093
01:44:10,145 --> 01:44:12,625
He was drunk
and had an accident.

1094
01:44:17,145 --> 01:44:18,145
Let s forget it.

1095
01:44:20,273 --> 01:44:21,273
They said

1096
01:44:22,854 --> 01:44:24,134
it was my fault.

1097
01:44:43,607 --> 01:44:46,087
His family tried
to take away all I had.

1098
01:44:49,816 --> 01:44:51,016
Don’t you believe me?

1099
01:44:56,483 --> 01:44:59,363
I guess a man
gets what he deserves.

1100
01:45:01,692 --> 01:45:04,052
What can I offer?
A soldier s pay?

1101
01:45:05,318 --> 01:45:06,158
Yes.

1102
01:45:06,860 --> 01:45:09,300
A soldier's pay
buys a soldiers woman.

1103
01:45:26,822 --> 01:45:30,423
An urgent message
from Her Imperial Highness.

1104
01:45:38,657 --> 01:45:39,617
'Therefore,

1105
01:45:39,864 --> 01:45:43,304
in view of the aggression
of the armed forces'

1106
01:45:43,657 --> 01:45:46,697
of Great Britain,
Germany, Russia, France,

1107
01:45:47,032 --> 01:45:50,152
the United States,
Japan, Italy and Austria

1108
01:45:50,533 --> 01:45:52,733
' under the command
of Admiral Sydney,

1109
01:45:53,282 --> 01:45:56,402
the Imperial
Chinese Government demands

1110
01:45:57,283 --> 01:45:58,563
the immediate

1111
01:45:58,867 --> 01:46:00,307
and unconditional surrender

1112
01:46:00,575 --> 01:46:03,455
of the armed forces
of these nations

1113
01:46:03,825 --> 01:46:05,425
' and of all their weapons.

1114
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:08,120
We will
await your reply.

1115
01:46:20,537 --> 01:46:22,297
I believe, Sir Arthur,

1116
01:46:22,619 --> 01:46:25,259
that you are
the architect of our dilemma.

1117
01:46:25,661 --> 01:46:26,741
What do you propose?

1118
01:46:27,537 --> 01:46:30,537
I think you should all
know the military facts.

1119
01:46:31,245 --> 01:46:34,205
We have had
almost 100 casualties,

1120
01:46:34,578 --> 01:46:36,658
that is about 25%
of our forces.

1121
01:46:37,705 --> 01:46:39,905
Over half
our ammunition is gone,

1122
01:46:40,955 --> 01:46:43,835
food is low, medical
supplies are non-existent,

1123
01:46:46,290 --> 01:46:49,730
and by a reasonable estimate
it will take 4 or 5 weeks

1124
01:46:50,747 --> 01:46:54,508
to assemble forces on the coast
to fight through to Peking.

1125
01:46:55,414 --> 01:46:56,534
What is your answer?

1126
01:46:57,873 --> 01:47:00,553
We are all aware
of our own weakness.

1127
01:47:01,708 --> 01:47:04,388
I’ve been thinking
about the Chinese.

1128
01:47:05,124 --> 01:47:08,885
Prince Tuan persuaded
the Empress to commit her troops

1129
01:47:09,251 --> 01:47:11,291
in the hope
of an easy victory.

1130
01:47:11,584 --> 01:47:15,545
And he allowed Michaelson
through with Sydney's letter

1131
01:47:16,083 --> 01:47:17,683
hoping we d collapse.

1132
01:47:18,460 --> 01:47:20,740
The ultimatum
means he s promised

1133
01:47:21,042 --> 01:47:22,802
our immediate surrender.

1134
01:47:23,502 --> 01:47:24,222
Now,

1135
01:47:24,836 --> 01:47:26,476
if instead of collapsing

1136
01:47:27,004 --> 01:47:29,004
we show unexpected strength,

1137
01:47:29,794 --> 01:47:31,274
and not only hold out

1138
01:47:32,419 --> 01:47:33,979
but attack,
we may destroy

1139
01:47:34,670 --> 01:47:36,150
Tuan s influence

1140
01:47:36,419 --> 01:47:39,499
with the Empress
and force her to face reality.

1141
01:47:40,211 --> 01:47:41,731
This is a man of faith.

1142
01:47:42,045 --> 01:47:44,685
He thinks if we blow
our trumpets, the walls

1143
01:47:45,004 --> 01:47:48,645
of Peking will collapse.
How many trumpets do we have,

1144
01:47:49,048 --> 01:47:49,928
Major?

1145
01:47:52,213 --> 01:47:53,773
I don’t know, Baron.

1146
01:47:54,629 --> 01:47:57,989
But Sir Arthur has
a good idea about the Empress...

1147
01:48:01,048 --> 01:48:03,368
About the Empress, understand

1148
01:48:03,756 --> 01:48:05,876
there must be
no attempt on her life.

1149
01:48:07,549 --> 01:48:09,789
I wouldn’t even
know where to start.

1150
01:48:10,467 --> 01:48:11,747
I don’t want her killed.

1151
01:48:14,508 --> 01:48:15,748
You don't want!

1152
01:48:16,424 --> 01:48:17,904
It would mean chaos.

1153
01:48:18,508 --> 01:48:21,468
Wed be fighting here
for the next 20 years.

1154
01:48:22,258 --> 01:48:24,018
Do you have a better idea?

1155
01:48:24,592 --> 01:48:28,513
I give you my word,
it would only enlarge the war.

1156
01:48:31,551 --> 01:48:33,191
You re the diplomat.

1157
01:48:33,886 --> 01:48:35,926
But let us
fight the battles.

1158
01:48:37,511 --> 01:48:38,631
Come on, Colonel.

1159
01:48:42,636 --> 01:48:44,636
- What do you think?
- Well...

1160
01:48:46,303 --> 01:48:47,263
I’m thinking that

1161
01:48:49,513 --> 01:48:51,033
if you re thinking

1162
01:48:52,347 --> 01:48:54,027
what I think you re thinking,

1163
01:48:54,972 --> 01:48:56,012
then...

1164
01:48:58,931 --> 01:49:00,011
I’m afraid

1165
01:49:00,512 --> 01:49:02,352
I must agree
with Sir Arthur.

1166
01:49:15,807 --> 01:49:17,407
They re using
the big guns.

1167
01:49:17,891 --> 01:49:20,091
The Empress
has committed her troops.

1168
01:49:20,433 --> 01:49:22,993
Get everybody
into the compound.

1169
01:49:23,598 --> 01:49:24,598
Here, take her.

1170
01:49:29,684 --> 01:49:30,604
Arthur,

1171
01:49:32,391 --> 01:49:34,231
Tommy s all right!

1172
01:49:34,726 --> 01:49:36,646
He just woke up
and spoke to me.

1173
01:49:36,934 --> 01:49:39,094
He s going to live!

1174
01:49:39,602 --> 01:49:41,362
- He s going to live!
- Live?

1175
01:50:27,148 --> 01:50:29,908
You wanted to avoid
a war and We’ve got one.

1176
01:50:30,274 --> 01:50:32,314
You wanted
to wait for Sydney.

1177
01:50:32,649 --> 01:50:34,049
Sydney isn’t coming.

1178
01:50:34,443 --> 01:50:36,883
You say we should attack.
Attack whom?

1179
01:50:37,233 --> 01:50:39,473
The Imperial Army?
And with what?

1180
01:50:39,776 --> 01:50:41,776
With 115 rusty guns?

1181
01:50:42,068 --> 01:50:44,028
I’ve heard
Tuan is preparing

1182
01:50:44,360 --> 01:50:46,440
a victory celebration tonight

1183
01:50:46,735 --> 01:50:48,495
in the Imperial Courtyard.

1184
01:50:48,985 --> 01:50:50,545
I suppose
we're all invited?

1185
01:50:51,401 --> 01:50:53,601
Rather than surrender, we must

1186
01:50:53,944 --> 01:50:55,824
make Tuan lose face.

1187
01:50:56,319 --> 01:50:58,159
We could
blow up the palace.

1188
01:50:59,027 --> 01:51:02,668
The Chinese have an arsenal
near the Imperial City.

1189
01:51:03,612 --> 01:51:05,372
- We could...
- I’ve heard of it.

1190
01:51:05,696 --> 01:51:09,096
- Blow it up during their party.
- It's behind their lines.

1191
01:51:09,738 --> 01:51:12,138
Then We’ll go
under their lines.

1192
01:51:12,488 --> 01:51:14,128
- How?
- Look at your map.

1193
01:51:15,322 --> 01:51:17,762
We could get to it
via the sewer

1194
01:51:18,239 --> 01:51:21,199
and blow it up when
Tuan s telling the Empress

1195
01:51:21,573 --> 01:51:23,013
we've been defeated.

1196
01:51:23,281 --> 01:51:26,481
- It's through here.
- Getting back is another matter.

1197
01:51:27,823 --> 01:51:28,783
We...

1198
01:51:29,240 --> 01:51:32,120
You don’t need genius
to crawl up a sewer.

1199
01:58:11,248 --> 01:58:12,408
We can t get away.

1200
01:58:21,626 --> 01:58:23,266
We’ll be blown sky high.

1201
01:58:27,458 --> 01:58:28,618
I’ve got to cut it.

1202
01:59:45,969 --> 01:59:47,129
It s too short.

1203
01:59:48,550 --> 01:59:50,390
If we light it
we won t get clear.

1204
02:00:03,052 --> 02:00:05,292
Get those
two ends joined.

1205
02:01:27,855 --> 02:01:30,255
I suppose you
have come to report

1206
02:01:30,563 --> 02:01:33,163
the destruction
of the Legations,

1207
02:01:33,772 --> 02:01:36,612
for the tenth time
since the last moon.

1208
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:40,880
I have come to ask
Your Majesty s permission

1209
02:01:41,649 --> 02:01:43,369
to impeach
General Jung-Lu

1210
02:01:43,690 --> 02:01:45,930
as a friend
to the barbarians.

1211
02:01:46,525 --> 02:01:49,365
It s true he turned back
the foreign admiral,

1212
02:01:49,734 --> 02:01:53,575
but he has guns the Boxers
need yet refuses to lend them,

1213
02:01:54,067 --> 02:01:55,907
despite your commands.

1214
02:01:56,233 --> 02:01:57,153
Be silent.

1215
02:01:59,109 --> 02:02:00,349
General Jung-Lu.

1216
02:02:02,693 --> 02:02:05,373
Despite the empty
promises of the Boxers,

1217
02:02:06,236 --> 02:02:08,676
the foreign devils
grow stronger.

1218
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:11,960
Even the Forbidden City
is no longer safe.

1219
02:02:13,735 --> 02:02:16,775
Underestimating the enemy
is a great calamity.

1220
02:02:18,363 --> 02:02:21,123
You will speak
to the foreigners, Jung-Lu.

1221
02:02:23,529 --> 02:02:26,089
Tell them peace
is a great blessing

1222
02:02:26,989 --> 02:02:30,790
and that no calamity is greater
than lightly engaging in war.

1223
02:03:01,617 --> 02:03:04,497
- Have they called off the war?
- Throw a line.

1224
02:03:18,910 --> 02:03:20,470
Here, what have we got?

1225
02:03:22,245 --> 02:03:25,805
A message for each
of the Ministers from Jung-Lu.

1226
02:03:29,496 --> 02:03:30,776
They want a truce.

1227
02:03:31,078 --> 02:03:33,398
We spoiled
the Empress s party.

1228
02:03:33,704 --> 02:03:37,024
She s just as likely
to decide to finish us off.

1229
02:03:37,373 --> 02:03:38,293
What does it say?

1230
02:03:38,579 --> 02:03:42,300
'We are disturbed by the
arrival of troops at Tientsin'.

1231
02:03:42,706 --> 02:03:43,666
Tientsin?

1232
02:03:44,123 --> 02:03:47,844
Unless they are withdrawn,
I must consider it

1233
02:03:48,249 --> 02:03:51,649
an act of war and will
commit the Imperial Forces. '

1234
02:03:52,456 --> 02:03:54,736
Allied troops in Tientsin.

1235
02:03:55,833 --> 02:03:59,233
- But they must think we re dead.
- Only 70 miles away.

1236
02:03:59,624 --> 02:04:00,384
Yes.

1237
02:04:01,291 --> 02:04:03,251
If we could
get word to them...

1238
02:04:05,792 --> 02:04:08,512
You mean if I
could get word to them.

1239
02:04:10,668 --> 02:04:11,548
Oh, no.

1240
02:04:12,042 --> 02:04:13,842
Old soldiers never volunteer.

1241
02:04:31,752 --> 02:04:32,792
Natalie.

1242
02:04:41,171 --> 02:04:42,371
I’m going away.

1243
02:04:44,796 --> 02:04:46,196
- When?
- Right now.

1244
02:04:46,504 --> 02:04:47,384
I’m waiting,

1245
02:04:47,631 --> 02:04:48,591
Baroness.

1246
02:04:52,631 --> 02:04:55,151
- Where are you going?
- To get help.

1247
02:04:55,881 --> 02:04:57,361
The patient is waiting!

1248
02:04:57,755 --> 02:05:00,235
This is not
a reception hall.

1249
02:05:05,049 --> 02:05:06,049
Will you come back?

1250
02:05:07,757 --> 02:05:09,037
Sure, if I can.

1251
02:05:10,383 --> 02:05:11,303
Natasha!

1252
02:05:12,008 --> 02:05:12,928
Listen...

1253
02:05:23,259 --> 02:05:24,339
What does he want?

1254
02:05:24,634 --> 02:05:26,554
Do you think
people can change?

1255
02:05:27,260 --> 02:05:30,420
That s something I can t
study under a microscope.

1256
02:05:32,094 --> 02:05:35,174
- You look wonderful. You shaved.
- You noticed.

1257
02:05:35,554 --> 02:05:37,434
Get me some
adhesive please.

1258
02:05:53,180 --> 02:05:54,300
I’m going now.

1259
02:05:56,638 --> 02:05:57,638
You said that.

1260
02:06:00,056 --> 02:06:01,416
Yes, I know but...

1261
02:06:09,057 --> 02:06:10,057
So long.

1262
02:06:40,144 --> 02:06:41,224
Wait a minute.

1263
02:06:48,019 --> 02:06:50,619
We never did
get a chance to talk?

1264
02:06:54,396 --> 02:06:56,396
Look, I have
to go somewhere but...

1265
02:06:57,272 --> 02:06:58,392
I’m coming back.

1266
02:07:00,479 --> 02:07:01,759
Like my father.

1267
02:07:03,854 --> 02:07:06,054
I’m coming back.
We'll talk then.

1268
02:07:10,063 --> 02:07:11,023
All right?

1269
02:07:18,940 --> 02:07:19,780
Come on.

1270
02:07:26,482 --> 02:07:29,202
Where s that other
bottle of ether?

1271
02:07:29,565 --> 02:07:32,165
- You say that every day.
- There was one.

1272
02:07:32,482 --> 02:07:34,442
We used it over a week ago.

1273
02:07:34,776 --> 02:07:37,856
- And the morphine?
- It s all gone. You know it.

1274
02:07:38,818 --> 02:07:39,698
Well,

1275
02:07:40,067 --> 02:07:42,907
We’ll have to operate
on the Italian regardless.

1276
02:07:43,860 --> 02:07:46,140
He may faint
and feel nothing.

1277
02:07:48,943 --> 02:07:49,823
lodine.

1278
02:07:50,402 --> 02:07:51,402
Here.

1279
02:07:52,860 --> 02:07:53,940
This is empty!

1280
02:07:54,904 --> 02:07:55,944
I’m sorry.

1281
02:07:56,485 --> 02:07:59,165
Don’t stand there.
Get me another bottle.

1282
02:08:00,612 --> 02:08:02,092
This was the last bottle.

1283
02:08:03,696 --> 02:08:06,776
No alcohol,
no iodine, amateur nurses...

1284
02:08:08,489 --> 02:08:11,009
We re back
in the Dark Ages.

1285
02:08:21,282 --> 02:08:23,322
No ether
for anesthetics,

1286
02:08:24,324 --> 02:08:26,084
no morphine for pain.

1287
02:08:27,492 --> 02:08:29,372
We are in
the land of opium

1288
02:08:29,822 --> 02:08:31,782
and there are no opiates.

1289
02:08:44,533 --> 02:08:45,213
Look out!

1290
02:09:04,412 --> 02:09:06,532
Rogers, are you all right?

1291
02:09:27,038 --> 02:09:29,398
Major, I’m hurt.
I'm hurt bad.

1292
02:09:32,498 --> 02:09:33,498
I’ll get you back.

1293
02:10:44,965 --> 02:10:47,845
Death s about and yet
your door is open.

1294
02:10:49,467 --> 02:10:52,427
Open or closed it cannot
protect either of us.

1295
02:10:54,258 --> 02:10:55,258
Old man...

1296
02:10:55,968 --> 02:10:57,488
Life and death,

1297
02:10:58,175 --> 02:10:59,735
are they important?

1298
02:11:00,426 --> 02:11:01,466
Not to the gods.

1299
02:11:02,844 --> 02:11:05,484
There are many men dying.
In pain.

1300
02:11:06,217 --> 02:11:07,457
They need drugs.

1301
02:11:07,969 --> 02:11:09,649
I do not deal in opiates.

1302
02:11:09,968 --> 02:11:11,848
There are others who do.

1303
02:11:12,302 --> 02:11:15,302
The Chinese outside
can only help you now.

1304
02:11:18,261 --> 02:11:20,061
Even in war, old man,

1305
02:11:21,971 --> 02:11:23,171
a valuable gift

1306
02:11:23,471 --> 02:11:25,031
can work miracles.

1307
02:11:31,554 --> 02:11:32,754
I want the drugs today.

1308
02:11:34,972 --> 02:11:37,772
And a wagon full
of fruit for the children.

1309
02:12:05,600 --> 02:12:07,640
Come on, Charlie. Rest here.

1310
02:12:49,230 --> 02:12:51,390
Let s see
what s in here.

1311
02:13:32,693 --> 02:13:34,253
All right, open it up!

1312
02:13:47,988 --> 02:13:49,148
How did you do it?

1313
02:14:23,201 --> 02:14:24,441
To your positions.

1314
02:14:24,867 --> 02:14:25,867
The truce is over!

1315
02:16:01,379 --> 02:16:03,379
It s all right.
We made it.

1316
02:16:22,757 --> 02:16:24,037
Get him to hospital.

1317
02:16:35,842 --> 02:16:37,042
I didn’t make it.

1318
02:17:33,182 --> 02:17:34,982
Major, I heard
you were back.

1319
02:17:36,141 --> 02:17:37,661
Off you go.

1320
02:17:39,558 --> 02:17:40,438
Major,

1321
02:17:40,850 --> 02:17:41,370
Major,

1322
02:17:41,643 --> 02:17:43,723
wake up! Wake up!
The railroad...

1323
02:17:44,767 --> 02:17:46,847
tracks are much closer.

1324
02:17:49,516 --> 02:17:50,356
Yes.

1325
02:17:52,852 --> 02:17:55,412
- How close are they?
- Almost to the wall.

1326
02:17:58,060 --> 02:17:58,980
All right.

1327
02:17:59,894 --> 02:18:01,134
Get me a shirt.

1328
02:18:09,021 --> 02:18:11,061
- Did you hear about the Baroness?
- No.

1329
02:18:11,354 --> 02:18:12,634
She was shot.

1330
02:18:14,770 --> 02:18:17,410
- What?
- She s in the hospital.

1331
02:18:21,856 --> 02:18:23,456
Major, we d better hurry.

1332
02:18:32,647 --> 02:18:33,687
Yes... Yes.

1333
02:18:55,361 --> 02:18:56,201
Don’t...

1334
02:18:56,650 --> 02:18:58,850
Don’t take it
so hard, doctor.

1335
02:19:00,818 --> 02:19:02,858
You must
let me try again.

1336
02:19:04,275 --> 02:19:06,115
Soon it will be too late.

1337
02:19:07,612 --> 02:19:09,452
You’ve done
all you can do.

1338
02:19:11,194 --> 02:19:13,634
I must find
the focus of the infection.

1339
02:19:17,152 --> 02:19:20,032
You wont find it
with a knife, doctor.

1340
02:19:23,403 --> 02:19:25,163
Don’t you want to live?

1341
02:19:28,279 --> 02:19:29,599
I...

1342
02:19:30,904 --> 02:19:32,424
I have lived.

1343
02:19:34,114 --> 02:19:35,794
Don’t think of anything

1344
02:19:36,323 --> 02:19:37,923
except living.

1345
02:19:38,323 --> 02:19:39,763
Give yourself

1346
02:19:40,657 --> 02:19:41,777
a chance.

1347
02:19:44,323 --> 02:19:45,363
A chance?

1348
02:19:47,241 --> 02:19:49,121
A chance for what?

1349
02:19:51,533 --> 02:19:53,733
A chance to do
it all over again?

1350
02:19:55,491 --> 02:19:57,811
No, thank you, doctor.

1351
02:20:03,326 --> 02:20:07,167
If you die the light
will be gone from this place.

1352
02:20:10,450 --> 02:20:11,250
No.

1353
02:20:14,786 --> 02:20:16,026
You're...

1354
02:20:16,869 --> 02:20:19,549
the one who makes
all the light here.

1355
02:20:24,869 --> 02:20:27,069
Forgive me
when I say that

1356
02:20:29,996 --> 02:20:32,356
working with you
I’ve learned

1357
02:20:32,704 --> 02:20:34,624
to care for You very much.

1358
02:20:38,788 --> 02:20:41,308
I’m glad
you said that, Hans.

1359
02:20:43,498 --> 02:20:46,218
A woman likes to hear it.

1360
02:20:49,956 --> 02:20:51,876
Most men haven’t

1361
02:20:52,416 --> 02:20:54,936
the courage to say it.

1362
02:21:39,463 --> 02:21:41,943
They re closer
now than when I left.

1363
02:21:42,254 --> 02:21:45,534
If it was for a gun,
they wouldn’t come so close.

1364
02:21:46,004 --> 02:21:46,564
Yes.

1365
02:21:48,838 --> 02:21:49,998
Get Father de Bearn.

1366
02:21:50,298 --> 02:21:51,218
Yes, sir.

1367
02:22:16,801 --> 02:22:18,161
What is it, Major?

1368
02:22:18,466 --> 02:22:20,386
Ever seen
anything like that?

1369
02:22:31,511 --> 02:22:32,911
I certainly have not.

1370
02:23:32,852 --> 02:23:34,812
You can t stop
that with rifles.

1371
02:23:35,143 --> 02:23:36,863
But we have to stop it.

1372
02:23:37,810 --> 02:23:39,970
Get me those urns
from the tower,

1373
02:23:40,311 --> 02:23:42,911
coal oil and
some black powder

1374
02:23:43,229 --> 02:23:45,349
and empty
champagne bottles too.

1375
02:23:57,772 --> 02:24:01,052
Right now, put it
down here, not there.

1376
02:24:02,188 --> 02:24:03,308
Pick up those bags.

1377
02:24:07,857 --> 02:24:11,498
Where are those bottles
and the powder? Come on, hurry!

1378
02:24:12,648 --> 02:24:13,528
That s it.

1379
02:24:22,065 --> 02:24:24,785
With a little prayer
and a lot of luck...

1380
02:24:37,527 --> 02:24:40,847
- Bad luck.
- You weren’t praying hard enough.

1381
02:24:41,775 --> 02:24:42,575
Give me that.

1382
02:24:45,569 --> 02:24:47,409
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

1383
02:24:58,487 --> 02:25:01,087
- Come on.
- We'll pray harder, Father.

1384
02:25:01,404 --> 02:25:02,164
Yes.

1385
02:25:47,535 --> 02:25:49,895
It must be terrible
to be a soldier.

1386
02:25:51,535 --> 02:25:52,335
Yes...

1387
02:25:54,661 --> 02:25:56,261
Sometimes it is.

1388
02:26:20,664 --> 02:26:22,064
I was looking for you.

1389
02:26:23,579 --> 02:26:24,979
The Baroness is dead.

1390
02:26:32,874 --> 02:26:34,474
Nothing to say?

1391
02:26:39,957 --> 02:26:41,717
She didn’t mean
much to you.

1392
02:26:42,458 --> 02:26:43,418
Shut up!

1393
02:26:45,125 --> 02:26:47,485
- Sorry.
- Let me alone! Let me alone!

1394
02:27:45,881 --> 02:27:47,761
I just heard.
I’m sorry.

1395
02:27:51,342 --> 02:27:51,982
Thank you.

1396
02:28:01,383 --> 02:28:04,023
Well, we bought
ourselves another day.

1397
02:28:04,843 --> 02:28:06,643
Still, it wasn’t
a bad fight.

1398
02:28:10,386 --> 02:28:11,466
What time is it?

1399
02:28:15,261 --> 02:28:17,741
5.37 a. m.

1400
02:28:18,262 --> 02:28:20,782
August 14th, 1900.

1401
02:28:23,386 --> 02:28:25,186
How many days
did we hold out?

1402
02:28:26,637 --> 02:28:28,277
Fifty-five.

1403
02:30:21,901 --> 02:30:24,141
Those guns!
They re not Chinese!

1404
02:30:29,735 --> 02:30:30,895
Strange!

1405
02:31:14,616 --> 02:31:16,976
They re ours!
It s the relief forces!

1406
02:31:20,701 --> 02:31:21,821
They re ours!

1407
02:32:31,291 --> 02:32:32,331
They re ours!

1408
02:32:33,127 --> 02:32:36,407
They re here!
They re here!

1409
02:33:06,797 --> 02:33:09,317
They re ours!
They re ours!

1410
02:34:44,060 --> 02:34:46,500
Water can support a ship.

1411
02:34:58,268 --> 02:35:00,268
And water can upset it.

1412
02:35:07,436 --> 02:35:09,436
The dynasty is finished.

1413
02:36:05,610 --> 02:36:06,570
Listen.

1414
02:36:07,112 --> 02:36:09,272
They re playing
different tunes.

1415
02:36:09,569 --> 02:36:12,889
Well, for 55 days
we played the same tune.

1416
02:36:13,987 --> 02:36:16,667
Fifty-five days you
held us together.

1417
02:36:16,988 --> 02:36:18,788
You might
have started something

1418
02:36:19,195 --> 02:36:21,475
that people
will remember some day.

1419
02:36:21,820 --> 02:36:24,180
- We re ready.
- I’ll be right there.

1420
02:36:27,905 --> 02:36:29,665
Will you stay in China?

1421
02:36:30,530 --> 02:36:32,410
Oh, I go where
they send me.

1422
02:36:33,531 --> 02:36:34,531
How about you?

1423
02:36:35,112 --> 02:36:37,032
I’ll be going
home to England.

1424
02:36:37,322 --> 02:36:39,722
Retired to private life,
I suppose.

1425
02:36:40,156 --> 02:36:42,916
In the country with
a dog and a few books.

1426
02:36:43,283 --> 02:36:45,203
An Englishman s dream, really.

1427
02:36:46,490 --> 02:36:48,250
What s home for you?

1428
02:36:49,283 --> 02:36:50,603
I don’t know.

1429
02:36:51,492 --> 02:36:53,052
I may have
to make one.

1430
02:36:55,283 --> 02:36:56,403
Good luck, Matt.

1431
02:36:57,702 --> 02:36:58,622
Thanks.

1432
02:37:28,371 --> 02:37:30,851
Right shoulder... arms!

1433
02:37:59,166 --> 02:38:01,126
Here, take my hand.

1434
02:38:14,001 --> 02:38:16,481
Forward ho!
