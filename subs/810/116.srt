雅什・曹帕拉: 印度知名导演 （1932.9.27～2012.10.12）

2
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:49,000
本片为其遗作 谨向这位贡献了不少佳作的导演致敬

3
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
现代 列城市场 拉达克

4
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,475
喂 你干什么?
Hey, what are you doing?

5
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:58,241
长官 给阿南德少校送防爆衣
Bomb suit for Major Anand, sir

6
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,208
他不会穿的
He won't wear it

7
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,753
但是长官... 我觉得...
But sir... I mean...

8
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:03,716
你看着就是了
Keep watching

9
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,284
德万 情况怎么样?
What is it, Dewan?

10
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:08,617
长官 我搞不定
I can't figure it out, sir,

11
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,491
看起来这是通过无线遥控引爆的
it looks like a radio control servo with a switch,

12
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:14,158
但我找不到接收器
but I can't locate the receiver

13
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:16,501
X光也是什么都找不到
and the x-ray hasn't shown up anything either

14
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,196
你歇着吧 我来看看
You rest, I'll take a look

15
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:20,394
好的 长官
OK, sir

16
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:53,635
长官 他是不是就是那个传说中的
Sir, is this the same Major Samar Anand,

17
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,140
拆弹记录保持者 萨马・阿南德少校?
who has the record for the maximum number of bombs defused?

18
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:58,676
是的 他已拆了九十七枚炸弹
Yup, 97 bombs,

19
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:00,636
这是第九十八枚
this is the 98th,

20
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:03,647
而且 他拆弹的时候就是这样 
and he goes into the lap of each bomb just like this,

21
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,910
不用任何防护
without any protection,

22
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:07,042
好像面对的不是炸弹
as if it's not a bomb,

23
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,279
而是他女朋友的臂弯
but the arms of his girlfriend

24
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:14,653
长官 所以人们都称他为"不死传奇"?
Sir, is that why they call him 'the man who cannot die'?

25
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:18,257
是的 "不死传奇" 
Yes, 'The Man Who Cannot Die'

26
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,929
所有人都终将死去
All of us have to die one day

27
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:22,694
他也一样
and so will he,

28
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:26,927
但我从没在他眼睛里看到过对死亡的恐惧
until today I've never seen the fear of death in his eyes

29
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,170
我也不能理解他为什么选择这种生活
I can't understand the kind of fate he's had written for himself

30
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:08,573
他们把接收器藏在炸药里 然后用铅包住
They had hidden the receiver within the RDX and covered it with lead,

31
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:08,573
{\an8}RDX：三次甲基三硝基胺 军用高能炸药

32
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,739
所以X光检查不出来
that's why the X-ray couldn't catch it

33
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:15,948
辛格 可以开放集市了
Singh, open up the market

34
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:17,019
是的 长官
Okay sir

35
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,054
阿玛努拉 长官 开放集市
Amaanullah, sir, open the market

36
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,846
你顽皮而狡黠的眼神
Your eyes, impish and mischievous

37
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:46,647
你傲慢而冷淡的笑容
Your laughter's nonchalant insolence

38
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:50,052
你随意披散的长发
Your hair unfurled their waves undone

39
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:52,281
我永或不忘
Never shall I forget

40
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:55,593
至死方休 至死方休
Until I breathe this life, Until I breathe this life

41
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:08,031
再握不到你的手
Your hand that abandoned mine

42
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:10,399
枉自凝视你渐远的背景
Your shadow that turned away it's gaze

43
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,171
再不得见你的面容
Your look that never looked back

44
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,145
我永或不忘
Never shall I forgive

45
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,678
至死方休 至死方休
Until I breathe this life, Until I breathe this life

46
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,564
你在雨中洒脱的舞姿
Your unabashed dancing in the rain

47
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:36,766
你傻傻的小任性
Your silly sulkings at all things small

48
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,239
你天真烂漫的小顽皮
Your innocent childlike mischief

49
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,703
足够我珍爱一生
Always I will love

50
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:46,077
不死不休 不死不休
Until I breathe this life, Until I breathe this life

51
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,093
你虚假的誓言和承诺
Your false vows and promises

52
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,898
你癫狂炽热的梦想
Your burning scorching dreams

53
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,274
你残忍无情的祷告
Your cruel ruthless prayers

54
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,298
我永远难以释怀
Always I will hate

55
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,802
不死不休 不死不休
Until I breathe this life, Until I breathe this life

56
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
爱无止境

57
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,716
上帝保佑...
In the name of God...

58
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,293
操!
Oh shit!

59
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,767
这水太凉了...
the water is freezing...

60
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:30,973
救命啊!
Help!

61
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,880
救命啊!
Help!

62
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,712
兵哥!
Soldier!

63
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,021
水好冷... 冷死了... 求求你...
water... col... cold... freezing... please

64
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,321
求你... 救救我...

65
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:46,665
求你了...
please...

66
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,522
如果我死了怎么办?
what if I had died?

67
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:23,734
你就不能早点来救我吗?
Couldn't you have come earlier?

68
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:28,967
你是个军人...
You're a soldier...

69
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,507
你... 你们不是宣过誓...
you'll... have taken some oath haven't you...

70
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:34,736
要保卫同胞的生命吗?
to save lives of fellow lndians?

71
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,950
刚刚我的情况多么危急...
I was in such a dangerous situation...

72
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:41,884
我可能会死掉...
I could have died...

73
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,323
混蛋!
Arsehole!

74
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,032
漂亮!
Nice!

75
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,610
哦 天啊!
Oh God!

76
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,076
亚基拉!
Akira!

77
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:12,143
你居然真的去做了!
I can't believe you actually did it!

78
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:13,180
伙计们 掏钱!
Just pay up guys!

79
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,345
你快把我搞破产了
I'm going bankrupt because of you,

80
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,885
这是三周以来的第五次大冒险了
this is the fifth dare in 3 weeks,

81
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,684
拜托你能少去几次吗?
for once can you not complete a dare?

82
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,021
山姆 别像个胆小鬼 
Stop being such a wuss, Sam,

83
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,528
再过两天你们就要去伦敦探索频道工作了
two more days and you all will be in the London discovery office

84
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,354
而我却只能呆在德里
and I will be stuck in Delhi,

85
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:28,091
那时你们就会思念我了 
and then you will miss me and you'll be like

86
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,198
你们会想当初把所有的钱都给亚基拉就好了
I wish I had given Akira all my money,

87
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,032
毕竟她这个实习生也该劳有所得
after all she got paid shit as an intern

88
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:33,128
我才不会想你
I won't miss you

89
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,140
听好了 停下手头上的活儿
Alright, you lot listen up, stop whatever it is you are doing,

90
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,240
今天我休息
it's my day off,

91
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,836
今天我不想看到你们这群蠢货
so I don't want to see any of your ugly faces today,

92
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,945
但是明天早上我要你们
but tomorrow morning I want your boney arses,

93
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:44,915
七点准时回到这儿
back here at 7 o'clock sharp

94
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,315
好的 队长
Aye, aye, Captain

95
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:47,651
凯瑟琳!
Catherine!

96
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,880
滚开 亚基拉
Piss off, Akira

97
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,819
你有考虑过把带我去伦敦吗?
Did you think about taking me with you to London?

98
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,984
是的 我考虑过 答案是不行 所以滚吧
Yes, I did and the answer is no, so get out of my face

99
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,562
贱人!
Bitch!

100
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,971
哦 天啊...
Oh, God, man...

101
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:15,107
阿琼 我说了我们没戏了
Arjun, I told you it's over between us man,

102
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,416
别再打过来了...
stop calling me...

103
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:20,382
阿琼
Arjun,

104
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,852
我们才处了六个月 你怎么就放不下呢?
it's only a 6-month relationship, why are you getting so hyper?

105
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:28,549
简单点说 你还爱我 但我已经不爱你了
You still love me but now I don't, simple,

106
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:31,228
拜托 放手吧 以后再说!
come on, get over it, we'll talk later!

107
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,908
萨马・阿南德...
Samar Anand...

108
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:58,457
我不知道自己是怎么活过这二十五年的
In a way, I had already lived twenty-five years,

109
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,919
但我的人生从这一天起 才真正开始
but my life, actually began on this day,

110
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:14,739
我人生的第一天
The first day of my story,

111
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:18,099
我第一次看见雪花飞舞
the first time I saw snow fall,

112
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:22,312
第一次目睹天使在漫天雪花里穿行
the first time I saw an angel glide across the snow

113
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:49,634
非得现在下雪吗?
Did You have to make the snow fall right now,

114
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,241
就不能再等十分钟?
couldn't You have waited 10 minutes more?

115
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,308
害得我这么贵重的裙子都被风雪打湿了
Such an expensive dress, it got wet

116
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,941
总之 我的成绩出来了
Anyway, my results are out,

117
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:58,674
全校第一诶
I topped the university

118
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:00,149
爸爸他很高兴
Dad is very happy

119
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,183
谢谢您
Thank You,

120
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,687
我遵守诺言我今后再也不吃巧克力了...
and yes, like I promised You, no more chocolates from today...

121
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,347
绝不 我保证
never, I promise

122
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:08,660
现在请听好了 今天的事情很重要
Okay, now listen carefully, today our work is very important

123
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:12,528
比娜婶婶家要办一场音乐会
There's a music ceremony at Bina aunty's

124
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:15,236
桑格夫人想把我介绍给她儿子 
and Mrs.Sanger wants to hook me up 

125
00:12:15,237 --> 00:12:16,932
就那个华尔街银行家
with her wall street banker son

126
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:21,797
请求您 千万千万确保他不喜欢我
Please, please, please make sure that he doesn't fancy me,

127
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,674
我也会尽量惹他厌恶
I will also fully try to make sure but,

128
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:29,074
但您知道的 印度男人追我的时候都太蠢了
You know how Indian boys behave stupid, when they're around me

129
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:32,117
无论如何 我也不会嫁给印度人的
and in any case, I am not going to marry an Indian boy,

130
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:33,981
还记得我跟你说的话吗?
remember me telling You this?

131
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,385
请不要让我嫁给印度男孩
Please don't get me married to any Indian boy,

132
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:37,956
他们肤色都那么暗沉
they are all very brown

133
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,287
请帮我找一个帅气的白人男孩吧
Please find me a nice handsome white boy,

134
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,657
求你了 求你了

因为当那个所谓的好男人给你戴上戒指时
because when that nice guy, was making you wear the ring,

269
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:42,916
你没有望着他的眼睛
you were not looking into his eyes,

270
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:44,580
而是看着别人...
you were looking at everyone else...

271
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:49,190
现在 你离开了自己的订婚典礼
and now, you've left your own engagement celebration,

272
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,827
独自坐在这里 又是为什么?
and are sitting here alone, why?...

273
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:55,733
你又为什么要向一个陌生人解释你的决定?
and why are you trying to explain your decision to a stranger?

274
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:00,798
说... 明白了吧
Go... got it

275
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,534
快来米拉 叔叔找你都快找疯了
Come on Meera uncle's going nuts looking for you

276
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,110
威尔... 我找到她了
Will... I found her

277
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:18,921
去他妈的...
What the f...

278
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:25,092
新的商标能同时传达出办店的理念和形象
The new logo will reflect the ideals and images of both chains,

279
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:27,275
总计二十五家连锁超市
a total of 25 new supermarkets 

280
00:24:27,276 --> 00:24:29,600
将分别进驻到六个新城镇
will be opened in six new towns

281
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:32,535
整个兼并和扩张的过程将会耗时六个月
and the whole merger and expansion will take six months

282
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:33,635
谢谢
Thank you

283
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:41,240
罗杰 干得好 你考虑的很周到
Well done. Roger, you've thought about everything

284
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:43,810
我想我可以考虑退休了
I think it's time for me to think about my retirement,

285
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:47,477
我马上就五十岁了 是时候该退休了
I am turning 50, best time to retire,

286
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,546
您五十岁生日是什么时候?
When is your Golden Jubilee?

287
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,516
米拉 我们应该办个盛大的生日宴会
Meera, we should plan a big party

288
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,388
别担心 我已经为生日宴会筹划了一年多了
Don't worry, I've been planning this party for more than a year now,

289
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:58,054
这是给最特别的父亲筹划的特别庆祝
it's going to be the most special party for the most special father

290
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:00,731
是的 然后就是我女儿的婚礼了
Yes, and after that my daughter will get married and then,

291
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,963
我这个非常特别的父亲 就要变成孤家寡人啦
from a very special father I'll turn into a very lonely father

292
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:08,870
我不会丢下你不管的
But that will only happen if I leave you alone,

293
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:11,636
我结婚后 罗杰会来和我们住在一起
after our marriage Roger will stay with us

294
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:13,703
我什么时候这么说过?
When did this happen?

295
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:16,679
就是现在 这是我新增的小条款
Just now, just a small little clause I've added in the contract

296
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:18,313
并且不容商议
and it's non negotiable

297
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:21,835
罗杰 抱歉啊 她随我呀 
Sorry Roger, she's gone on me, 

298
00:25:21,836 --> 00:25:24,018
是个非常固执的商业女性
a very stubborn business woman,

299
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,451
学着适应吧
you will have to deal with it

300
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:26,854
我尽量 尽量吧
I am trying, I am trying

301
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:37,234
给 五百镑
Here, 500 pounds,

302
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,001
算你一个月的报酬 每天一小时
for an hour of your time every day, for one month

303
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:42,603
你想买凶杀谁?
Who do I have to kill?

304
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:45,969
你教我唱歌
You'll have to teach me how to sing

305
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:51,539
你为什么要和我学唱歌?
Why do you want to learn how to sing from me?

306
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:54,708
我爸爸来自费朗达尔
My Dad's from Jalandhar,

307
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:57,780
他希望我能讲旁遮普语
and he's always wished that I could speak Punjabi,

308
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,289
但是我没有机会学
but I was never able to learn it

309
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,586
下个月就是他五十岁的生日了
It's his 50th birthday next month

310
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:05,822
我想唱首旁遮普歌 给他个惊喜
and I want to surprise him by singing a Punjabi song,

311
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:09,756
就像你之前唱的那样
Iike the kind that you sing,

312
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,996
你愿意教我唱歌吗?
so will you teach me?

313
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:17,138
五百英镑能让我的生活发生翻天覆地的变化
That way 500 pounds will turn my life around,

314
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:18,514
但如果我收了这笔钱 
but if I take these 

315
00:26:18,515 --> 00:26:19,735
我自己也会发生翻天覆地的变化
then I may also completely turn around

316
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:21,535
我给你解释下
I'll explain

317
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,307
我妈妈从小就教导我
My mother has taught me,

318
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:25,506
教别人是不能收钱的
never take money for teaching someone,

319
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,951
所以现在你知道我的... 额 难处了吧?
so now you understanding my, uh, problem?

320
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,015
既然如此 那你就免费教我好啦
So in that case teach me without taking money

321
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,182
小姐 别看我长得傻乎乎的
Madam, I only look like,

322
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,852
但我其实一点也不傻
but I am not that big a fool, not dumbo

323
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:38,494
那算了吧
Fine

324
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:44,167
唉 等下等下 我们做个交易如何?
Okay, one minute, one second, can we do a deal?

325
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:46,769
我教你唱动听的旁遮普语歌曲
I teach you beautiful Punjabi song

326
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:50,934
但作为回报 你要教我说标准的英式英语
and return gift you teach me good gentleman's English

327
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:53,368
小姐 这可是个超级划算的交易啊
this is now fair and handsome deal ma'am,

328
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:56,140
一个月后你就能在你爸爸的生日派对上
in one month you singing like the Nightingale Lata Mangeshkar,

329
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:57,203
用像夜莺一样美妙声音为他献唱
for your father's birthday

330
00:26:57,315 --> 00:27:01,479
而我能用一口流利标准的英语和白人们聊田
and I speak fit-fat constipation with the white in full tip-top English

331
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,252
那叫聊天
Conversation

332
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,718
都一样的嘛
Same to same

333
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,392
一言为定咯
Done, done, London let's do it

334
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,489
一言为定
Done, done, London

335
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,001
不好意思
Uh sorry

336
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:28,235
请您保佑我能说一口流利的旁遮普语
Please make sure my Punjabi rocks,

337
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:31,346
我希望那天成为我爸爸生命中最快乐的一天
I wish that day to be Dad's happiest day

338
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,050
请保佑我 我向您保证...
Please help me and I promise...

339
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:39,283
我保证再也不抽烟了... 绝对不抽了
I promise... I will never smoke again... ever

340
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,706
早... 早上好
good... good morning

341
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:06,858
女士 这是您点的牛排 
Steak for the lady 

342
00:29:06,859 --> 00:29:08,874
先生 这是您点的鲑鱼
and Salmon for the gentleman,

343
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:11,174
请慢用
enjoy

344
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:26,661
米拉
Meera

345
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,328
米拉 别生气啊 我开玩笑的
Meera listen, I was joking...

346
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,163
等下 先生 您还没结账
Excuse me sir you haven't paid

347
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:34,496
米拉 我身上没钱啊
Meera I don't have money

348
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,910
我们村用旁遮普语说叫Sirsa
Sirsa is the name of my village, in Punjab

349
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:46,873
我爸爸和祖辈的人都参了军
My father and forefathers all served in the army,

350
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,511
但他们全部都战死沙场
but in some war or other they gave their lives fighting

351
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:53,189
所以到我这一代 我妈妈就不让我参军了
When it was my time my mother refused to let me join,

352
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,291
她省吃俭用攒够了钱 把我送到这里
she somehow saved up money and sent me here

353
00:29:57,095 --> 00:30:00,394
她坚信我会在这里闯出一片天地
She had this unsaid faith in me and felt that I'd do well here

354
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,331
她说我很会讨人喜欢
She says that I can win people's love

355
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:05,800
这种人是一定会成功的
and those who can win love will never lose

356
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,599
这就是女性的知觉
Solid maternal instant

357
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,772
是直觉
Instinct

358
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:10,364
我读的就是知觉
Instant

359
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,942
好吧 随便吧...
Okay, what eves...

360
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:15,079
一个一个来 慢用
Come, please come, bon appetite

361
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,704
来 下一个
Come, come in,

362
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:22,383
慢用
Bon appetite...

363
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:24,718
慢用
Bon appetite...

364
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,756
你每周五都来这里?
Do you come here every Friday?

365
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:28,757
是啊
Yes!

366
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:31,123
只有这里?
Just here?

367
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:35,498
不啊 我每周一会去孟加拉孤儿收养所
No, there's a Bangladeshi orphanage that I go to on Mondays

368
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:36,757
还有吗?
And...

369
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:40,369
每周三我去一个妇女救济站
On Wednesdays I go to a women's shelter

370
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:41,769
还有没?
And...

371
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,308
每周日去老年之家帮忙
A senior citizens' home on Sundays

372
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,271
还有吗?
And...

373
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:48,634
就这些
That's it

374
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:50,909
就这点儿?
That's it...

375
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:52,768
周二 周四和周六的时间
Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, 

376
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:54,150
都浪费了啊 太可惜了
they're all wasted, very bad

377
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:56,119
特蕾莎修女终其一生行善
Mother Teresa gave up her whole life,

378
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:58,519
你好啊 我正在给她讲道理呢
oye, explain something to this girl

379
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,708
你好啊 小胖墩 
Oye, fatty, 

380
00:30:59,709 --> 00:31:01,525
你要吃多少啊 该开始节食了
how much will you eat, start a diet,

381
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:03,116
大家都过来吧 每人可以领份免费的食物
come all, free food for everyone

382
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:05,622
一分耕耘一分收获
How much you give is how much you get,

383
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,795
这是生活教会我的
I've learnt this in life,

384
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,095
但是如果每个人都只是一味的索取而不思回报
but if everybody keeps asking for more and no one gives back,

385
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:13,099
那谁还愿意分享?
then how will anything be shared?

386
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:16,096
很多时候 鱼与熊掌是不能兼得的
To get something you have to lose something

387
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:21,177
这就是你总喜欢和耶稣大人做交易的原因吧?
So that's why you keep making deals with sir Jesus

388
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:25,876
不是做交易... 而是虔诚地向上帝祈祷
Not deals... prayers that I make earnestly,

389
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:30,176
这也就是为什么上帝会应允我所有的愿望
and that's why your sir Jesus has agreed to everything I've told him

390
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:33,019
是嘛 那你让他教你唱歌好了
Okay, so tell Him to teach you how to sing

391
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:36,086
不用操心 我已经向他祈祷过了
Don't worry, I've already spoken to Him

392
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:37,126
真的啊...
Really...

393
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,489
上帝也会说旁遮普语?
Sir Jesus knows Punjabi too?

394
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,997
# 哦 朋友们 请不要叫我希尔 #
O friends, do not call me Heer

395
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:46,696
# 请叫我塞班 #
I am Sahiban now

396
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:52,006
# 让我的白马王子策马而来吧 #
Let any Mirza come on a horse...

397
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:57,710
# 让我的白马王子策马而来吧 #
Let any Mirza come on a horse...

398
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:06,781
太不公平了
This is so not fair,

399
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:09,186
在我的帮助下 你的英语提高了那么多
I've managed to improve your English so much

400
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,160
但你连一首歌都还没教会我
and you're not able to teach me even one song

401
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,253
你已经学会唱歌了
You've already learnt how to sing,

402
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:14,931
而且你的旁遮普语也讲得很流利
you're also speaking perfect Punjabi,

403
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:15,966
语调也没什么大问题
the tune is also fine

404
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:17,058
那问题出在哪里啊?
What's the problem then?

405
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:20,627
问题在于你没有把情感注入到你的歌声中去
The problem is that there is no joy when you sing,

406
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:21,694
你的歌声里充满了恐惧
only fear,

407
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,671
你害怕吵到旁边的那位白人女士
you're scared this white woman will be disturbed

408
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,377
你怕吓到那些踢足球的人
Scared that these guys playing football,

409
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:28,219
怕他们会把你误认为是
will think 

410
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,036
从某个印度山沟沟里逃出来的
you've runaway from some poor lndian village

411
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:29,704
振作起来
Come on,

412
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:31,873
如果当着这么点人的面你都不敢唱
if you can't sing in front of two or three strangers,

413
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:33,746
那到时候在几百号人面前你怎么敢开口?
how will you sing to a hundred people at the party?

414
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:34,875
混开!
Oh f... off!

415
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:37,750
你总是这样
Now this you enjoyed doing

416
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:40,718
米拉・塔帕尔小姐 虽然你总是装的一本正经
Miss Meera Thapar, the girl you are when you act dignified,

417
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:41,918
但你肯本不是那样的人
you're not,

418
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:44,925
你就是那种偷偷溜出来抽烟
you're that girl who sneaks out to smoke a cigarette,

419
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:47,760
总是出口成脏的女人
and keeps cussing this what the f...? What the f...? word.

420
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,124
我才不是那样的人
I am not that girl

421
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,295
电话借我用下
I need your phone please,

422
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,530
抱歉
excuse me,

423
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:55,600
稍等片刻
one second

424
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,372
玛利亚你好 我是萨马
Hello Maria, Samar this side,

425
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:03,406
麻烦你今晚带我的一个朋友一起去隧道那边
yes I want you to bring a friend of mine to the tunnel tonight ok,

426
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:05,242
她晚点会联系你的... 玛利亚 还有一点
she will call you... and Maria...

427
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,978
她这个人比较害羞 所以你帮她打扮下吧
she is a little shy type so make her like you,

428
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:12,216
弄的性感点 漂亮点 好 晚上见
Iittle sexy, un dos tres, ok bye

429
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:13,947
玛利亚和我一样在餐馆工作
Maria works in the restaurant with me

430
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:15,958
每周日晚我们所有人都会小聚一下
and every Sunday night all of us party together

431
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:19,427
你现在有她的号码了 六点之后联系她
You have the number in your phone, call her after six

432
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:23,600
那里没人认识你...
And no one knows you there...

433
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:27,497
所以这一晚 放下包袱 随心而动吧
so for just one night listen to your heart

434
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:29,804
你为什么要这么做?
Why are you doing this?

435
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:35,405
因为我想让你知道你自己到底是个什么样的人
Because I want to show you who you really are

436
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:51,959
来吧 亲爱的
Come on, babe

437
00:33:58,236 --> 00:33:58,998
嗨 玛利亚
Hey, Maria!

438
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,298
你好啊
hi

439
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,865
最近还好吧?
What's up?

440
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:05,869
我去去就来
I'll will be right back

441
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,443
壮汉 去把她拿下！
Go get her tiger!

442
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:22,323
嗨 玛利亚
Hey Maria!

443
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:23,451
嗨
Hi...

444
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:37,306
我马上就回来
I'll be right back

445
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:47,776
你好...
Hello...

446
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:53,779
我叫拉兹
I'm Raj,

447
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,388
你叫?
you are?

448
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:02,156
我叫蒂娜...
Tina...

449
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,126
意大利人吗?
Italian?

450
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:06,530
印度人
Indian

451
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:09,835
你看起来一点也不像印度人啊
You don't look Indian at all

452
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:13,835
一看你就是印度人
And you look completely Indian

453
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:15,444
何以见得?
Why?

454
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,244
你不喜欢印度男人?
You don't like lndian men?

455
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,214
印度男人好无趣的
They're very boring,

456
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,482
我喜欢有点冒险精神的男人
I like a bit of danger in a man

457
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,657
那你来这里岂不是如鱼得水嘛
So then this place is like a buffet for you,

458
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:30,050
你看 这么多人任你挑啊
and in any case since you've come they're all just waiting for your cue

459
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,356
随便挑一个吧
Take your pick

460
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:34,654
没看见中意的
I don't see anybody here,

461
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:36,858
没看见那种能伴我同行的人
somebody who'd walk side by side with me,

462
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:41,302
那种只需一个眼神就能掳获我芳心的人
who'd look into my eyes and steal my heart

463
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:45,800
那就只能祝你好运喽 印度姑娘
Best of luck, Indian girl

464
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,706
拉兹...
Raj...

465
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:55,546
才说几句你就放弃了啊
You give up too easily

466
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,712
我又没想讨你欢心
I wasn't even trying

467
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:01,385
为什么? 难道你不喜欢我?
Why, you don't like me?

468
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:02,735
我对你有好感 
I like you, 

469
00:36:02,736 --> 00:36:05,187
但我知道你现在想寻求点新鲜事物
but at the moment you're looking for something else

470
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:07,931
当你倦了累了 自然会回到这里
When you get tired you'll come back here

471
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:10,496
万一我不回来了呢?
And if I don't?

472
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:14,963
你会回来的
You'll come

473
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:19,235
因为那个能伴你同行的人
...because for someone who'd walk by your side,

474
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:21,571
那个会深情的望着你的人
for someone who'd look into your eyes,

475
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:24,506
那个能够掳获你芳心的人就在这里
for someone who'd steal your heart,

476
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,881
除此之外别无他人
there's no one else here

477
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:40,692
米拉 赶紧的 你可不能错过这个啊
Come on Meera, you've got to see this

I've had the best time of my life, Samar,

526
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:53,752
太感谢你了
thank you so much,

527
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:56,492
我真不知道该怎么感谢你好!
thank you, thank you, thank you

528
00:44:57,394 --> 00:44:59,828
你现在知道自己其实是个坏女孩了吧
You know you're actually this bad ass girl,

529
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:02,155
实在搞不懂你怎么会生在那样正统的家庭
how you were born into such a fancy family, I can't understand

530
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:05,267
既然我这么坏 那就别和我做朋友喽
If I'm that bad, don't be friends with me

531
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:07,365
谁说我要和你做朋友啦?
Who wants to be friends?

532
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,286
不过既然我已经爱上了你 
Now that I have fallen for you, 

533
00:45:09,287 --> 00:45:10,598
我有什么办法呢?
what do I do about that?

534
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,913
不是开玩笑 我是真的已经...
I'm not joking, I have really fallen in...

535
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:20,948
... 爱上你了
...Iove

536
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:28,124
你如此不羁的一面
It's this bad ass behaviour of yours,

537
00:45:28,192 --> 00:45:30,888
完全隐藏在你正经的外表下
hiding behind this well behaved suave person,

538
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:34,187
恰恰是这点让我如醉如痴
that's trapped me

539
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,204
萨马...
Samar...

540
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,404
是的 我知道你要说什么... 
Yes, I know... 

541
00:45:43,405 --> 00:45:44,871
你就要嫁给那个英国男人了
you're getting married to that English guy,

542
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:46,855
而且我们之间的约定也已经完成了 
and now our contract is also over 

543
00:45:46,856 --> 00:45:48,102
所以也没有理由再见面了
so there's no reason to meet

544
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:49,404
你不用紧张
So no tension,

545
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:53,176
你的车来了 我们就此分道扬镳
your train's come, you go your way and I go mine,

546
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:54,582
一切到此为止
the end

547
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:46,830
本车的终点站是斯坦莫尔
This train terminates at Stanmore

548
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:48,265
米拉...
Meera...

549
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:52,369
如果我现在吻你...
If I kiss you...

550
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,874
你会煽我一巴掌吗?
will you slap me?

551
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:10,160
我赌你不会煽我
I don't think you will slap me

552
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:17,016
你没煽我
You didn't slap me,

553
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:23,365
你没煽我呦
you didn't slap me

554
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:05,366
# 哦 朋友们 请不要叫我希尔 #
O friends, do not call me Heer

555
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:08,237
# 请叫我塞班 #
I am Sahiban now

556
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:13,541
# 让我的白马王子策马而来吧 #
Let any Mirza come on a horse...

557
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:18,510
# 让我的白马王子策马而来吧 #
Let any Mirza come on a horse...

558
00:49:19,022 --> 00:49:23,152
# 让他把我带走 #
...and abduct me

559
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:34,927
# 哦 朋友们 请不要叫我希尔 #
O friends, do not call me Heer

560
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:37,763
# 请叫我塞班 #
I am Sahiban now

561
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:43,145
# 让我的白马王子策马而来吧 #
Let any Mirza come on a horse...

562
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:48,607
# 让我的白马王子策马而来吧 #
Let any Mirza come on a horse...

563
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:10,098
# 我中有他 他中有我 #
I am just like him. He's just like me

564
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:13,108
# 他的笑声好似清晨的第一缕阳光 #
His laughter is like the morning sunlight

565
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:18,074
# 当他闭上双眼 便是无尽的黑暗 #
Soothing darkness falls when he closes his eyes

566
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:21,978
# 我中有他 他中有我 #
I am just like him. He's just like me

567
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:25,016
# 他的笑声好似清晨的第一缕阳光 #
His laughter is like the morning sunlight

568
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:29,851
# 当他闭上双眼 那便是无尽的黑暗 #
Soothing darkness falls when he closes his eyes

569
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:36,062
# 我中有他 他中有我 #
I am just like him. He's just like me

570
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:42,094
# 我中有他 他中有我 #
I am just like him. He's just like me

571
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:45,974
# 哦 朋友们 请不要叫我希尔 #
O friends, do not call me Heer

572
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:49,039
# 请叫我塞班 #

573
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:54,417
# 让我的白马王子策马而来吧 #
Let any Mirza come on a horse...

574
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:59,354
# 让我的白马王子策马而来吧 #

575
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:03,817
# 让他把我带走 #

576
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:15,729
# 哦 朋友们 请不要叫我希尔 #

577
00:51:15,972 --> 00:51:18,634
# 请叫我塞班 #

# 让我的白马王子策马而来吧 #
Let any Mirza come on a horse...

580
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:37,388
晚上好啊 米拉
Good evening, Meera

581
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:54,203
我真饿死了
I'm famished

582
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:55,971
你想吃点东西吗?
You want to eat?

583
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:10,856
炒面来喽
Chum va fa

584
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:12,829
米拉・塔帕尔小姐 
So, Miss Meera Thapar, 

585
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:14,721
你今天来是因为你也爱上我了吗?
so you've also fallen in love

586
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:17,433
两天没见着我就受不了 是不是?
You couldn't live without me for more than two days, right?

587
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:21,801
要不我们再来一个约定?
Let's do the done done London deal

588
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:26,675
我就要... 嫁给罗杰了
I am going to get married... to Roger,

589
00:52:26,776 --> 00:52:28,641
这是我爸爸的意思
because that's what my father wants

590
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:35,044
从小爸爸就尽力满足我所有的愿望
He's always given me everything I've ever wanted

591
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:38,882
这是第一次我有机会能满足他的愿望
This is the first time he's asked something of me,

592
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:43,693
我不能拒绝他
I can't say no to him

593
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:55,295
我妈妈很早就抛下我和爸爸 跟别的男人跑了
My mother left my father and ran away with someone else,

594
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:01,042
那时我只有十二岁
I was twelve then

595
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,681
这些年来都是爸爸一个人照顾我
My father has taken care of me by himself

596
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:10,817
他总能设法满足我所有的愿望
He has always fulfilled my wishes,

597
00:53:13,456 --> 00:53:15,924
现在我就只有他一个亲人了
we're the only family we have,

598
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:19,288
我们俩相依为命...
there's no one else...

599
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:28,802
我从没跟别人说过这些 就连罗杰也不知道
I haven't told this to anyone before now, not even Roger

600
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:37,313
我之所以跟你说这些 是因为你必须要帮我
I'm telling you this because you have to help me

601
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,799
我们俩必须一起对上帝发誓
Both of us, have to make a promise in front of Him,

602
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,964
我们仅仅只是朋友关系
that we'll remain just friends

603
00:54:04,941 --> 00:54:07,876
绝不越界
and will never cross this line

604
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,906
如果我们当中的任何一个食言
and if we break this promise,

605
00:54:15,218 --> 00:54:18,016
上帝可以以任何方式惩罚我们
He can punish us in any way He chooses

606
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,721
米拉 我不愿和你只是做朋友
I can't be friends with you, Meera,

607
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:30,794
不过你不用担心 我是不会越界的
but don't worry I will never cross any line,

608
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:35,365
我不用向上帝发誓就可以做到
and for that I don't need to make any kind of promise to God

609
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:41,777
这个誓言不是用来约束你的行为
This isn't for you, Samar,

610
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:46,080
而是用来约束我自己的
this is for me,

611
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:51,076
只有这样我才不会犯错
so that I don't make any mistake,

612
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,922
只有这样我才不会心软
so that I may not grow weak,

613
00:54:58,361 --> 00:55:00,955
只有这样我才能够不越界
so that I may not cross the line

614
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:08,033
萨马 拜托了
Please Samar,

615
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:10,996
帮我这一次吧
for me

616
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:36,898
# 你走在我身边 却并不靠近我 #
Walk by my side leaving a space between us

617
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:39,799
# 你近在咫尺 却宛若千里 #
Put your heart or hand there

618
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:44,997
# 我走在你被拉长的影子里 #
I walk in the shade cast by your shadow

619
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:48,844
# 你走在我身边 却并不靠近我 #
Walk by my side leaving a space between us

620
00:55:48,945 --> 00:55:51,709
# 你近在咫尺 却宛若千里 #
Put your heart or hand there

621
00:55:51,815 --> 00:55:56,582
# 我走在你被拉长的影子里 #
I walk in the shade cast by your shadow

622
00:55:57,821 --> 00:56:02,820
# 我中有他 他中有我 #
I am just like him. He's just like me

623
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:08,700
# 我中有他 他中有我 #
I am just like him. He's just like me

624
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:12,760
# 哦 朋友们 请不要叫我希尔 #
O friends, do not call me Heer

625
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:15,698
# 请叫我塞班 #
I am Sahiban now

626
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:20,804
# 让我的白马王子策马而来吧 #
Let any Mirza come on a horse...

627
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:24,642
# 让他把我带走 #
...and abduct me

628
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:36,450
# 哦 朋友们 请不要叫我希尔 #
O friends, do not call me Heer

629
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:39,286
# 请叫我塞班 #
I am Sahiban now

630
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:44,623
# 让我的白马王子策马而来吧 #
Let any Mirza come on a horse...

631
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:50,005
# 让我的白马王子策马而来吧 #
Let any Mirza come on a horse...

632
00:56:57,647 --> 00:56:59,308
- 早上好 小姐 - 早上好
- Good morning ma'am - Good morning

633
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:01,373
你有个包裹
Here is a parcel for you

634
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:14,897
我亲爱的米拉
My dearest Meera,

635
00:57:15,298 --> 00:57:18,159
我在杂志上读到了你结婚的消息 
I read about your marriage in a magazine 

636
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,258
情不自禁给你寄了点东西
and couldn't help myself

637
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:23,099
这么多年过去了 
It's been so many years and not one day has gone by,

638
00:57:23,306 --> 00:57:25,672
没有一天我不想着你
when I haven't thought of you,

639
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:30,642
但是我向你父亲保证过 我永远都不会联系你
but I promised your father that I would never contact you

640
00:57:32,148 --> 00:57:34,207
你每年过生日的时候
For all your birthdays

641
00:57:34,317 --> 00:57:35,978
我都会买一份礼物
I'd buy a gift,

642
00:57:36,252 --> 00:57:38,083
给你写一封信
and write a long letter addressed to you

643
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:40,713
然后把它们保存到柜子里
and then put them both away in the cupboard,

644
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,623
但是这次我再也控制不住自己了
but this time I couldn't stop myself

645
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,228
每个母亲都有这样的梦想
Every mother has a dream

646
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:49,123
梦想着亲手给女儿穿上她的结婚莎丽
to dress her daughter in her wedding sari herself,

647
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:49,123
{\an8}莎丽：印度妇女用以裹身包头的整段布

648
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:50,826
但是我知道...
but I know that...

649
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,796
很多年前我就失去了这项权利
I lost this right many years ago

650
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:56,232
这件莎丽 就是我当年
The wedding sari that I wore 

651
00:57:56,233 --> 00:57:58,133
穿着来到你父亲家的那件
and came to your father's house,

652
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:01,803
我为了这一天一直仔细保存着
I've kept very carefully for this day

653
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:04,840
如果你觉得可以 请穿上它
If you think it is okay, wear it,

654
00:58:05,248 --> 00:58:08,684
我会觉得好像我也亲临了你的婚礼
I will feel like I am also a part of your wedding

655
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:12,415
我知道你恨我
I know that you hate me,

656
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:15,054
但是我每天都向上帝祈祷
but I pray to God everyday,

657
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:19,255
希望有一天你能原谅我
hoping that one day you'll forgive me

658
00:58:19,462 --> 00:58:21,225
愿你被无尽的爱包围着
Lots and lots of love

659
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:23,399
享有无尽的快乐
and lots of happiness,

660
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:26,134
你的母亲 波亚
your mother, Pooja

661
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:29,200
旁遮普 如果用英语发音的话
Punjab, as English say,

662
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:32,299
鲍伯・迪伦就是从那儿来的
Bob Dylan was from there,

663
00:58:33,943 --> 00:58:37,538
鲍柏・辛格・迪伦 鲍勃变成勃勃
Babbar Singh Dhillon, Bob became Bub

664
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:01,103
那么现在你想怎么办?
So now what do you want to do?

665
00:59:03,006 --> 00:59:04,200
我不知道
I don't know

666
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:07,639
米拉不知道
Meera doesn't know,

667
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,710
但是蒂娜知道怎么做
but Tina knows what to do

668
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:17,352
出发?
Should we go?

669
01:00:08,705 --> 01:00:10,036
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

670
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:12,470
跟你在做一样的事情呀
The same thing you're doing

671
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:14,940
你今天是不是有点太放松了?
Aren't you taking it a little too easy today?

672
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,473
前些天你那么忙
These days you are so busy

673
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:20,410
我都没机会跟你呆在一起
I don't get a chance to spend time with you

674
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:23,678
即使你离我这么近 却还是感觉很遥远
Even with you so close to me you're still not with me,

675
01:00:23,753 --> 01:00:26,381
等待着你的时间里 我度日如年
awaiting your return I can't see the end of the day

676
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:29,721
别做这种无聊的诗了 伊姆兰
Stop this boring poetry of yours, lmran

677
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:31,384
- 挺烦人的 - 好吧
- It's annoying.- Okay

678
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:33,429
嘿 P小姐! P小姐!
Hey Miss P! Miss P!

679
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:36,332
什么着急事儿呀 亨利?
Where is the fire, Henry?

680
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:38,730
有人在门廊那儿等你 P小姐
Someone's waiting for you at the porch, Miss P

681
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:39,665
等我?
For me?

682
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:40,667
我今天没有约啊
I've no appointments today

683
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:42,101
是餐馆来的人
It's those people from the restaurant

684
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:44,196
我告诉他们来取葡萄酒的样品
I told them to come and sample the wines

685
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:46,036
那么他们找我干什么?
So why are they asking for me?

686
01:00:46,342 --> 01:00:48,310
因为他们跟你一样无聊
Because they're very boring, like you

687
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:51,313
我告诉他们我不怎么管事了 他们应该找你
I told them I'm mostly out and they should meet you

688
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:53,645
一点也不好笑 伊姆兰
It's not funny, lmran

689
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:55,510
听着
Listen

690
01:00:55,585 --> 01:00:56,483
嗯?
Hmm?

691
01:00:57,086 --> 01:00:58,212
我爱你
I love you

692
01:00:58,287 --> 01:00:59,276
我知道
I know

693
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:04,349
呵呵呵笑什么呢 小屁孩
What's so hehehe, kiddo,

694
01:01:04,794 --> 01:01:07,285
你就没跟某个女孩说过我爱你吗?
you never said I love you to a girl before?

695
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,742
我的孩子...
My baby...

696
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:09,214
我的孩子...
My baby...

697
01:02:32,482 --> 01:02:33,972
我当年才19岁
I was 19 years old,

698
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:36,644
我嫁给你父亲 飘扬过海来到这里后
when I married your father and came from India

699
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,183
我才知道
Until then I had learnt,

700
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:42,886
一个女孩从娘家嫁出来 和她丈夫成了家
that a girl goes from her father's home to her husband's,

701
01:02:42,959 --> 01:02:44,950
就开始了一种新生活
and that becomes her new life

702
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:47,792
你父亲是个好人
Your father was a very nice man,

703
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:51,627
但是我永远都没法爱上他
but I could never love him,

704
01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:55,366
好长一段时间以来 我并没觉得缺了点什么
and for a long time I didn't feel like anything was missing

705
01:02:55,471 --> 01:03:00,306
他忙着做生意 我忙着养育女儿
He was busy with his business and I was busy bringing up my daughter,

706
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:02,200
直到有一天
and then one day

707
01:03:02,845 --> 01:03:04,870
我遇见了伊姆兰...
I met lmran...

708
01:03:05,515 --> 01:03:06,641
那时候我就...
and that's when...

709
01:03:08,351 --> 01:03:09,716
...你坠入了情网
...you fell in love

710
01:03:10,253 --> 01:03:12,744
是 我坠入了情网
Yes, I fell in love

711
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:18,686
你那时才四岁 因此我克制住了...
You were four then that's why I stopped myself...

712
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:20,929
但是当你十二岁的时候
but when you turned twelve

713
01:03:22,565 --> 01:03:25,261
我坚持不下去了
I gave up

714
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:28,801
跟伊姆兰走了
and I went away with lmran

715
01:03:30,706 --> 01:03:33,004
那时候我才明白一件事
By then I understood one thing,

716
01:03:33,943 --> 01:03:35,843
如果你自己不开心
if you aren't happy yourself,

717
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:39,040
你永远都没法使别人开心
you can never keep others happy...

718
01:03:40,249 --> 01:03:41,546
永远
never

719
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:55,727
你知道吗...
You know...

720
01:03:56,632 --> 01:03:58,463
当我告诉伊姆兰
When I told lmran

721
01:03:58,734 --> 01:04:01,294
我不想再要孩子
I do not want another child other than you,

722
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:04,865
他微笑着跟我说 我们并不需要结婚
he smiled and said that we didn't need to get married,

723
01:04:05,374 --> 01:04:10,202
他不需要一纸证明或者征得牧师的同意
that he didn't need a piece of paper or the consent of a priest,

724
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:12,481
才答应一辈子跟我在一起
to be with me for life

725
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:16,318
他疯了... 就像我一样
He's crazy... just like me,

726
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:18,556
那可能也是我们需要彼此扶持
that's probably why we can't survive 

727
01:04:18,557 --> 01:04:19,688
才能活下去的原因
without each other

728
01:04:29,966 --> 01:04:32,958
这么多年来我只知道恨你
For all these years I've only hated you

729
01:04:36,472 --> 01:04:38,838
本来就是我的错...
But the fault was also mine...

730
01:04:39,742 --> 01:04:40,709
不...
No...

731
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:43,173
不是你的错
it wasn't your fault

732
01:04:44,413 --> 01:04:47,678
一个十二岁的女孩没法懂这一点
A 12-year-old girl could not understand this,

733
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:51,209
但我都二十一岁了
but a 21-year-old girl can,

734
01:04:51,921 --> 01:04:53,684
我能理解你...
that what you did...

735
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,351
你的所作所为是完全正确的
was absolutely right

736
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:04,489
我真想你 妈妈
I missed you mama,

737
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:08,396
我好想你
I missed you so much

738
01:05:17,847 --> 01:05:19,872
哦 你知道吗?
Oh, do you know,

739
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:22,576
打小以来我就希望有人能送我个这样的娃娃
since, childhood I've wished someone would give me a doll like this?

740
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:25,251
谢谢 波亚 非常感谢
Thank you, Pooja, thank you very much,

741
01:05:25,354 --> 01:05:26,946
- 见到你真好 - 见到你真好
- Good to see you - Good to see you too

742
01:05:27,056 --> 01:05:27,954
我带你去兜一圈怎么样?
Should I take you for a bike ride?

743
01:05:28,057 --> 01:05:29,354
好啊 我们走
Come on, let's go

744
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:33,421
谢谢你
Thank you,

745
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:37,461
你把我妈妈照顾得这么好
you've given mama so much love

746
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:41,634
实际上我该谢谢你
I should actually thank you,

747
01:05:42,038 --> 01:05:43,300
这么多年来
it's been many years,

748
01:05:43,372 --> 01:05:46,500
我一直都靠插科打诨来填补你的空缺
that I've been clowning about, to make up for your absence,

749
01:05:46,842 --> 01:05:48,776
但现在我可以退休了
but now I can retire

750
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,639
现在波亚都止不住笑
Now Pooja will never stop smiling

751
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:56,745
谢谢你能来 孩子 谢谢你
Thank you for coming my child, thank you

752
01:05:58,821 --> 01:06:00,686
我能问你一件事吗?
Can I ask you one thing?

753
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:05,117
妈妈告诉我 虽然她没做任何承诺
Mama told me you waited eight years for her,

754
01:06:05,761 --> 01:06:07,558
你等了她八年
without any promises

755
01:06:08,998 --> 01:06:13,162
你怎么能那么确定...你们终将会在一起?
How were you so sure that...you would be together one day?

756
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:18,998
每段爱都有它的时机 当时时机并不成熟
Every love has its time. That time was not ours,

757
01:06:19,508 --> 01:06:22,272
但不代表那不是爱
but that doesn't mean it wasn't love

758
01:06:22,678 --> 01:06:24,839
我相信我的爱
I had faith in my love

759
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:28,242
在真爱面前 如果上帝都会屈服
If God can bow down in the face of love,

760
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:29,648
时间怎么可能取胜?
how does time stand a chance?

761
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:31,277
总会时来运转的
It had to change,

762
01:06:32,855 --> 01:06:34,117
谢谢你 亲爱的
thank you darling,

763
01:06:35,725 --> 01:06:36,919
谢谢你
thank you

764
01:06:40,096 --> 01:06:41,757
- 伊姆兰 再见 - 拜拜
- Cheers Imran - Bye

765
01:06:45,801 --> 01:06:47,166
我爱你
I love you

766
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:48,764
我知道
I know

767
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:18,088
来点咖啡吧
Coffee

768
01:07:22,505 --> 01:07:23,938
我爱你
I love you,

769
01:07:31,313 --> 01:07:33,042
我爱你 萨马
I love you Samar,

770
01:07:38,154 --> 01:07:39,621
我爱你
I love you

771
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,130
你越界了 米拉
You're crossing the line, Meera

772
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:09,974
我爱你
I love you

773
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:59,962
# 只要你我的气息相伴 #
As my breath mingles with yours

774
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:02,970
# 我就仿若重获新生 #
I can breathe again

# 我就仿若重获新生 #

# 你的体香直抵我的灵魂深处 #
The fragrance of your body touches my soul

778
01:09:51,253 --> 01:09:53,915
# 如果你靠近 #
If you come near

779
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:40,796
# 我能自持住几时? #
How long can I control my senses?

780
01:10:41,003 --> 01:10:46,339
# 何不任由感官跃动 #
Let them fly if they will

781
01:10:46,942 --> 01:10:52,574
# 狂乱的心何时才能安分下来? #
When has the heart walked the straight and narrow?

782
01:10:52,681 --> 01:10:58,244
# 何不任由心意徜徉 #
Let it wander if it will

783
01:10:58,721 --> 01:11:04,125
# 深深地陷入对你的思念之中 #
Lost in thoughts of you

784
01:11:04,526 --> 01:11:09,088
# 即便离群索居也能让我面带笑意 #
Solitude pleases me

785
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:14,806
# 只要你我的气息相伴 #
As my breath mingles with yours,

# 我就仿若重获新生 #
I can breathe again

787
01:12:29,445 --> 01:12:35,008
# 是夜只要有你陪在身边 #
If the sweet night is spent by your side

788
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:40,520
# 次日必有和风阳光叩开拂晓的序幕 #
The dawn will break with light and air

789
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:46,790
# 只要我们四目相接 #
Since my eyes caught sight of you

790
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:52,629
# 我的眼里满满的只有你 #
They brim over with you alone

791
01:12:52,768 --> 01:12:58,400
# 再次轻抚我 告诉我... #
Touch me again and tell me...

792
01:12:58,607 --> 01:13:03,704
# ...你许下了什么心愿? #
...what did you wish for?

793
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:09,984
# 只要你我的气息相伴 #
As my breath mingles with yours

替我祝夏洛特生日快乐 附带一个吻
Wish Charlotte a happy birthday for me, with a kiss

800
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:07,370
我今天要跟爸爸坦白 他会同意的 是吧?
I am going to speak with papa today, he'll agree, won't he?

801
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:09,240
他会同意的 如果不同意 给我打电话
He'll agree, if he doesn't, call me

802
01:14:09,344 --> 01:14:11,471
我会用一个吻来使他信服
I'll convince him with a kiss

803
01:14:12,147 --> 01:14:15,048
我现在要走了 否则我就要因此失业了
I'm leaving now, or because of your papa I'll loose my job

804
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:17,085
听着 那我的...
Listen, what about mine...

805
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:25,150
米拉!!
Meera!!

820
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:10,668
请让他完好无损
please let him be okay,

821
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:13,065
不要因我的错而惩罚他
don't punish him for my mistake,

822
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:19,942
请让他活着吧
You keep him alive,

823
01:15:20,048 --> 01:15:22,482
不遭受灾难 我保证
don't let anything happen to him and I promise,

824
01:15:23,452 --> 01:15:26,148
我保证我再也不见他了
I promise I will never meet him,

825
01:15:26,755 --> 01:15:28,484
求你了 上帝! 请让他完好无缺
please God! Let him be okay

826
01:15:33,061 --> 01:15:34,961
我保证... 我保证...
I promise... I promise...

827
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:36,722
请让他活过来
Please bring him back

828
01:15:36,832 --> 01:15:39,665
我向你保证我再也不会跟他见面
and I promise You I will never meet him again,

829
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:41,530
这件事过去之后我再也不会见他了 
after this I will never meet him, 

830
01:15:41,531 --> 01:15:42,395
拜托 拜托 上帝
please, please, please, God

831
01:15:42,504 --> 01:15:44,131
我将会永远离开他
I will leave him forever

832
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:45,230
先生
Sir

833
01:15:46,775 --> 01:15:49,335
拜托 请让他活过来...
Please, bring him back...

834
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:52,646
好的 准备好了 电击!
Okay clear. Shock!

835
01:17:38,954 --> 01:17:40,945
该死 我还是打不通米拉的电话
Shit ya, I still can't get through Meera's phone

836
01:17:41,223 --> 01:17:43,248
四天了 她都没打过来 她也没来医院
For four days she hasn't called, nor did she come to the hospital

837
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:45,589
你觉得是不是她父亲对她大发雷霆了?
Do you think her father's upset with her,

838
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:47,285
你去店里找过她了吗?
did you find out from her store?

839
01:17:47,429 --> 01:17:50,296
找过 保安说她也没去过
Yes, the guard was saying that she hasn't come there either,

840
01:17:50,365 --> 01:17:51,855
我也不知道怎么回事
I don't know what the scene is

841
01:17:51,967 --> 01:17:54,162
混蛋... 你真该去学学该怎么泡茶
Son of a... learn to make a simple cup of tea

842
01:17:54,436 --> 01:17:55,994
朋友 再忍一周
My friend, adjust for one more week,

843
01:17:56,071 --> 01:17:57,902
之后我就走了 你也喝不到我泡的茶了
after that neither will I be here, nor my tea

844
01:17:58,006 --> 01:17:59,332
为什么 你不是在白金汉宫
Why, you've got a job 

845
01:17:59,333 --> 01:18:00,770
找到了一份保安的工作了吗?
at Buckingham Palace, as a guard?

846
01:18:01,143 --> 01:18:03,077
没有 我要回拉合尔了
No, ya, I am going back to Lahore

847
01:18:03,278 --> 01:18:05,610
我呆在伦敦 也没什么奔头
Nothing is going to happen for me in London

848
01:18:05,814 --> 01:18:06,884
我靠你救济 继续找工作 
Till when will I live off your money 

849
01:18:06,885 --> 01:18:08,044
这种生活什么时候是个头呀?
and keep looking for a job?

850
01:18:08,116 --> 01:18:10,846
而且现在米拉也要来了...
And now Meera is also coming...

851
01:18:10,919 --> 01:18:13,024
于是我给我妈妈打电话 
so I called my mother 

852
01:18:13,025 --> 01:18:15,322
告诉她你儿子真没用...
and told her your son is useless...

853
01:18:15,557 --> 01:18:16,615
他要回去了
he's coming back

854
01:18:16,892 --> 01:18:18,621
想办法接受事实吧 还能怎么办?
Oh deal with it, what to do?

855
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:23,921
卡普尔叔叔 进来 不用见外
Kapoor Uncle, come in,think of it as your home,

856
01:18:24,466 --> 01:18:25,660
哦 糟糕
oh shucks

857
01:18:28,503 --> 01:18:29,470
米拉!
Meera!

858
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:31,838
啊 糟糕...
Ahh shucks...

859
01:18:35,811 --> 01:18:38,746
我去... 买点茶 买点糖
I'll... get that tea, that sugar,

860
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:41,213
我去买点东西 你好啊 米拉
I'll get something. Hello Meera

861
01:18:41,283 --> 01:18:43,080
- 拜 - 拜
- Bye - Bye

862
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:00,866
你爸爸不同意?
So papa didn't agree?

863
01:19:02,804 --> 01:19:04,499
我没告诉他
I didn't speak with him

864
01:19:04,873 --> 01:19:06,773
那你这些天在干什么?
So what were you doing all these days?

865
01:19:10,345 --> 01:19:11,744
我在祈祷
I was praying

866
01:19:12,547 --> 01:19:13,775
向耶稣大人祈祷吗?
To sir Jesus?

867
01:19:16,785 --> 01:19:17,877
实现了吗?
Was it fulfilled?

868
01:19:20,388 --> 01:19:21,446
当然了
Of course,

869
01:19:24,025 --> 01:19:25,151
你祈求的是什么?
What did you ask for?

870
01:19:26,128 --> 01:19:27,288
你的生命
Your life

871
01:19:28,563 --> 01:19:30,463
作为回报 你放弃了什么?
And in return, what did you give up?

872
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:32,957
你!
You!

873
01:19:37,973 --> 01:19:39,099
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

874
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:43,742
我祈祷说 无论如何 只要他能让你活下来
I prayed that He, by any means, keep you alive

875
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:47,676
作为回报 我将放弃一个对我来说
and in return, the one thing that is most precious to me,

876
01:19:48,650 --> 01:19:50,117
最珍贵的东西
I will leave that,

877
01:19:51,753 --> 01:19:52,879
永远
forever

878
01:19:54,389 --> 01:19:55,151
你疯了吗?
You've gone mad?

879
01:19:55,257 --> 01:19:56,622
萨马 拜托
Samar, please,

880
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:59,821
到这儿来看你已经够让我为难了
it's been very difficult for me to come here to you

881
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:02,422
我知道 你认为这些话就像是在胡扯
I realize that you think all this is rubbish,

882
01:20:02,731 --> 01:20:03,959
你不会懂的
you won't understand,

883
01:20:04,699 --> 01:20:05,688
但是这是我的信仰
but this is my belief,

884
01:20:05,901 --> 01:20:08,301
你因为我的错而受到了惩罚
that you were punished for my faults,

885
01:20:09,137 --> 01:20:13,301
如果我继续跟你在一起 你的生命...
that if I remain with you, your life...

886
01:20:15,944 --> 01:20:18,538
没人能打破这种信仰
now no one can break this belief,

887
01:20:19,047 --> 01:20:21,379
你不能 上帝也不能
neither you nor God

888
01:20:23,385 --> 01:20:25,216
我来这只为告诉你
I have come here only to tell you

889
01:20:25,387 --> 01:20:26,979
我要跟罗杰结婚了
that I am marrying Roger

890
01:20:31,626 --> 01:20:33,787
还想要你答应我一件事...
I've come to ask you for one thing...

891
01:20:35,197 --> 01:20:38,189
可能的话 请离开这座城市 远走高飞
that if possible, leave this city, and go away somewhere far,

892
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,398
拜托了...
please...

893
01:20:41,136 --> 01:20:42,467
权当是为了我
for my sake

894
01:20:48,977 --> 01:20:50,672
你没什么要说的吗?
You won't say anything?

895
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:07,084
祝贺你...
Congratulations...

896
01:21:11,233 --> 01:21:13,098
一言为定
Done, done London

897
01:21:15,937 --> 01:21:17,905
- 萨马 对不起... - 别...
- Samar, I'm sorry... - Don't...

898
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:25,110
别...
Don't...

899
01:21:50,505 --> 01:21:53,201
呃 这是什么?
Uh, what's this?

900
01:22:03,952 --> 01:22:06,477
给你妈妈打电话 告诉她 她儿子并非没用
Call your mother and tell her that her son is not useless,

901
01:22:06,554 --> 01:22:07,851
他不会回去了
that he's not coming back

902
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:11,188
也告诉她 她的另外一个儿子要回印度
and also tell her that her other son is going back to India

903
01:22:11,359 --> 01:22:13,259
请她为我祈祷
Ask her to pray for him

904
01:22:13,495 --> 01:22:15,759
我把我所有的钱都留给了你 我要走了
I am leaving all my money for you and going

905
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:17,525
现在你可以用它做份大买卖
Now make something big out of it,

906
01:22:17,999 --> 01:22:20,365
有一天我会回来拿我的那份的
I'll come back one day to take my share

907
01:22:21,202 --> 01:22:23,534
我会很想念你的那杯茶的
I'll really miss that tea of yours,

908
01:22:23,672 --> 01:22:26,300
你的朋友 萨马 再见
your friend, Samar, bye

909
01:22:44,259 --> 01:22:45,851
事情不该这样
This isn't right,

910
01:22:47,128 --> 01:22:48,390
都错了
it's all wrong,

911
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:51,098
彻底错了
completely wrong,

912
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:55,766
我和你正式开战
the war between you and me has begun

913
01:22:58,006 --> 01:23:00,600
你把我的爱从我这里偷走了...
You stole my love from me...

914
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:04,544
我要从你那儿偷走她对你的信仰
I'll steal her belief from You

915
01:23:07,015 --> 01:23:09,609
她相信如果我不跟她在一起
She believes if I am not with her

916
01:23:09,851 --> 01:23:11,341
我就能活下去...
I will live...

917
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:16,385
所以从现在开始
So from now on,

918
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:19,516
我每天都要拥抱死亡
I will embrace death every day,

919
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:25,226
走着瞧吧...
Let's see...

920
01:23:27,068 --> 01:23:29,628
你能让我活多久
till how long You keep me alive

921
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:56,418
谢谢你...
Thank you...

922
01:25:00,061 --> 01:25:01,426
萨马・阿南德
Samar Anand

923
01:25:03,398 --> 01:25:05,263
如果你是萨马的话 那就是说
If you're Samar that means,

924
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:07,231
米拉也是确有其人咯
there's also a Meera

925
01:25:09,571 --> 01:25:12,506
你为什么不回去找她呢?
Why didn't you go back?

926
01:25:13,041 --> 01:25:14,599
难道此后你再没见过米拉?
Didn't you meet Meera ever again?

927
01:25:15,443 --> 01:25:17,934
听着 兵哥 这事我本不该插手
Look soldier, I shouldn't actually involve myself in this,

928
01:25:18,012 --> 01:25:19,877
但显然我已无法置身事外了
but I am already involved now

929
01:25:20,982 --> 01:25:23,849
你不认识我
You don't know me,

930
01:25:24,085 --> 01:25:25,382
我可是个硬气的女孩
I'm a hardcore, kinda girl

931
01:25:25,487 --> 01:25:26,920
从不轻易落泪
I never cry and all,

932
01:25:27,589 --> 01:25:30,023
但是你的爱情故事深深地触动了我
but your love story made me fully sentimental

933
01:25:31,593 --> 01:25:34,187
我二十一岁了
Look, I'm this 21 year old,

934
01:25:34,496 --> 01:25:35,861
在这种随随便便和人上床
from this instant make out,

935
01:25:35,930 --> 01:25:37,955
说分手就分手的时代
instant breakup generation

936
01:25:38,066 --> 01:25:40,626
人们先上床 再考虑是否相爱
First we have sex and then we think if it was love or not

937
01:25:41,636 --> 01:25:46,096
人们不懂爱情的本质
with these fundamentals of love there's solid confusion

938
01:25:46,641 --> 01:25:50,236
兵哥 我想知道
Soldier, all I want to know is,

939
01:25:51,012 --> 01:25:52,502
真爱确实存在吗?
is there such kind of love?

940
01:25:52,847 --> 01:25:53,871
我是说
what I mean is,

941
01:25:54,215 --> 01:25:55,961
要是它发生在了你身上 
if it's happened to you 

942
01:25:55,962 --> 01:25:57,707
就可能发生在任何人身上
it could happen to anybody,

943
01:25:58,253 --> 01:26:00,346
甚至是我?
maybe even me?

944
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:05,553
那么你告诉我
So tell me now,

945
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:07,418
这些到底是真的
was all this true or

946
01:26:07,896 --> 01:26:10,126
还是只是你杜撰的消磨时间的故事?
just a story you wrote to pass time?

947
01:26:11,633 --> 01:26:12,725
你叫什么名字?
What's your name?

948
01:26:13,201 --> 01:26:14,099
亚基拉!
Akira!

949
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:15,101
日本人?
From Japan?

950
01:26:16,404 --> 01:26:17,336
德里人
Delhi

951
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:18,828
你挺有意思的...
You're cool...

952
01:26:19,674 --> 01:26:22,165
就把它当作一个故事吧 别那么介怀
consider this a story and let it go

953
01:26:23,111 --> 01:26:24,237
你会一如既往地那么硬朗...
you'll remain cool...

954
01:26:34,923 --> 01:26:36,015
阿琼...
Arjun...

955
01:26:37,325 --> 01:26:39,088
你爱我吗?
do you love me?

956
01:26:41,596 --> 01:26:43,427
你愿意等我十年吗?
Can you wait ten years for me?

957
01:26:45,433 --> 01:26:46,559
不行?
No?

958
01:26:47,001 --> 01:26:49,561
那你就没机会了! 挂了吧!
Then you don't stand a chance!Put the phone down!

959
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:54,103
是你让我明白 兵哥
I give you this, soldier,

960
01:26:54,342 --> 01:26:56,902
什么是真正的爱情!
if it's love it better be this way!

1099
01:35:53,447 --> 01:35:55,415
# 他只身流浪 #
...and a tear

1100
01:35:55,516 --> 01:35:58,713
# 沿着街道漫无目的地流浪 #
Wanders aimless from street to street

1101
01:35:59,553 --> 01:36:01,487
# 处处为家 #
Belonging to all

1102
01:36:01,589 --> 01:36:03,489
# 又处处无家 #
Yet none to call my own

1103
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:06,924
# 沿着街道漫无目的地流浪 #
Wanders aimless from street to street

1104
01:36:08,496 --> 01:36:13,229
# 这癫狂的流浪汉在寻找着什么? #
What does this crazy wanderer seek?

1105
01:36:14,568 --> 01:36:18,561
# 这癫狂的流浪汉在寻找着什么? #
What does this crazy wanderer seek?

1106
01:36:18,672 --> 01:36:22,506
# 何处是我家? #
Where is my home?

1107
01:36:22,676 --> 01:36:25,372
# 他逢人必问 #
He asks every passer-by

1108
01:36:26,881 --> 01:36:31,717
# 这癫狂的流浪汉在寻找着什么? #
What does this crazy wanderer seek?

1109
01:36:35,556 --> 01:36:38,184
你白天敢与炸弹厮混
You play around with bombs in the day,

1110
01:36:38,993 --> 01:36:40,927
晚上会唱着浪漫的歌曲
and sing romantic songs by night

1111
01:36:43,030 --> 01:36:44,861
让我怎能不爱上你啊?
How is it possible not to fall in love with you?

1112
01:36:45,933 --> 01:36:46,900
等着瞧吧
You wait,

1113
01:36:47,668 --> 01:36:50,569
不出两周 你就会给亚基拉唱旁遮普民歌了吧
in two weeks you will sing Punjabi songs for Akira,

1114
01:36:50,805 --> 01:36:52,466
这就是我挑战
this is my challenge,

1115
01:36:53,107 --> 01:36:55,439
晚安 帅哥
good night, sexy

1116
01:37:24,638 --> 01:37:25,200
真他...
What the...

1117
01:37:25,206 --> 01:37:26,867
对不起...球拿来
Sorry... ball

1118
01:37:29,343 --> 01:37:30,275
扎尔
Afzal

1119
01:37:52,733 --> 01:37:55,361
唉 倒霉 摄像机坏了
Oh shucks, the camera broke

1120
01:38:01,442 --> 01:38:04,934
不行 亚基拉 不能用了
No ya, Akira, now this will not work,

1121
01:38:05,613 --> 01:38:07,911
在扎莫连配件都买不到
and we won't get these parts even in Jammu,

1122
01:38:08,449 --> 01:38:10,940
只能拿回德里修了
this can be fixed only in Delhi

1123
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:14,448
对不起 亚基拉 我...我...
I'm sorry, Akira I'm... I'm...

1124
01:38:14,555 --> 01:38:16,614
没事的 克里斯南   不是你的错
Hey it's okay,Krishnan, it's not your fault

1125
01:38:16,690 --> 01:38:17,850
见识到我那梅西式的射门技术
After seeing my Messi like kick,

1126
01:38:17,958 --> 01:38:19,619
惊得丢掉摄像机也是很正常的
anybody would have dropped the camera,

1127
01:38:19,927 --> 01:38:23,624
探索频道怎么会选用我拍摄的东西呢?
and in any case where was Discovery Channel going to take me?

1128
01:38:23,697 --> 01:38:25,961
我哪里还有什么机会
It was just a one-off chance I was taking

1129
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:28,468
晚安吧
Okay good night

1130
01:38:36,744 --> 01:38:37,733
兵哥
Soldier,

1131
01:38:39,179 --> 01:38:41,545
不用再麻烦你招待亚基拉啦
Akira's entertainment was only till here,

1132
01:38:41,615 --> 01:38:43,776
明早我就走了 回德里
tomorrow morning it's about-turn,back to Delhi,

1133
01:38:44,351 --> 01:38:45,648
你终于可以摆脱我了
finally you get rid of me,

1134
01:38:45,753 --> 01:38:48,119
现在 至少给我来个媚笑吧
at least now give me one sexy smile

1135
01:38:50,691 --> 01:38:52,124
无所谓了 你还是那么个脾气
Fine then, remain grumpy

1136
01:38:52,493 --> 01:38:55,462
亚基拉 至少吃点东西
Oye, Akira, at least eat your food

1137
01:38:55,996 --> 01:38:57,623
不了 辛格 我不饿
No ya, Singh, I'm not hungry

1138
01:38:59,934 --> 01:39:01,333
你们俩都得吃点
Both of you'll eat

1139
01:39:02,069 --> 01:39:03,058
不吃了 长官
No sir

1140
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:07,768
不吃算了
Fine don't eat

1141
01:39:20,354 --> 01:39:21,912
亚基拉! 微笑...
Akira! Smile...

1142
01:39:21,989 --> 01:39:23,149
现在大家看到的是
And now we have

1143
01:39:23,257 --> 01:39:25,346
来自探索频道的奥斯卡最佳微笑获得者 
Discovery Channel's Oscar-winning 

1144
01:39:25,347 --> 01:39:26,624
制作人亚基拉・拉埃小姐
film-maker miss Akira Rai,

1145
01:39:26,694 --> 01:39:27,922
跟你的粉丝们说点什么吧...
a few words for your fans...

1146
01:39:27,995 --> 01:39:29,121
嘿! 怎么修好的?
Hey! How is it fixed?

1147
01:39:29,196 --> 01:39:32,222
萨马修的 他精通电子设备
Samar did it,he's an electronics genius,

1148
01:39:32,333 --> 01:39:34,301
他修了一晚上
he worked all night on it

1149
01:39:35,703 --> 01:39:36,829
他在哪?
Where's that genius?

1150
01:39:46,580 --> 01:39:48,377
你这人怎么这么复杂?
Why are you so complicated?

1151
01:39:48,949 --> 01:39:52,248
让人又爱又恨
Neither can one fully hate you nor love you

1152
01:39:54,621 --> 01:39:56,452
现在我才明白
Actually I've understood now,

1153
01:39:56,523 --> 01:39:59,981
你看了我的泳装造型 就回心转意啦
after seeing me in my swimsuit,you've changed your mind,

1154
01:40:00,194 --> 01:40:01,855
觉得我很性感 是吧?
now I've started looking hot to you, right?

1155
01:40:04,264 --> 01:40:06,732
别这么盯着我 兵哥
Don't give me such intense looks, soldier,

1156
01:40:06,934 --> 01:40:09,528
让我感觉怪怪的
it fills me with this weird kind of sensation

1157
01:40:09,636 --> 01:40:12,503
你再废话连篇 我就去把摄像机砸了
Stop talking rubbish or I'll break the camera again

1158
01:40:12,773 --> 01:40:14,236
你先回答我... 
First tell me... 

1159
01:40:14,237 --> 01:40:16,675
为什么要忙一晚上帮我修摄像机?
why did you stay up all night and fix my camera?

1160
01:40:21,248 --> 01:40:23,079
你说到过追求
You spoke about passion

1161
01:40:24,018 --> 01:40:26,987
要是有人热衷某物又偏偏得不到
When someone is passionate about something and doesn't get it,

1162
01:40:27,388 --> 01:40:30,186
他会不惜倾其一生苦苦追寻
he spends a lifetime going mad chasing it

1163
01:40:31,458 --> 01:40:33,756
就像你眼前的这个癫狂的我
There's one mad man standing in front of you,

1164
01:40:34,795 --> 01:40:37,263
我不希望你也变成我这样
there is no place here for another mad person,

1165
01:40:38,732 --> 01:40:43,466
所以 拿着你的摄像机去完成心愿吧 走吧
so pick your camera,fulfill your passion and leave

1166
01:40:48,675 --> 01:40:53,271
随便你怎么说 你阻止不了我的
Try as hard as you can,you won't save me from going mad

1167
01:40:55,616 --> 01:40:57,550
靠近我一点 再往前来点
Towards me, more towards me

1168
01:40:57,684 --> 01:40:59,083
干得好
Nice, nice

1169
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:01,952
再来点 再来点
A little bit, a little bit

1170
01:41:02,456 --> 01:41:03,923
让我看看这设备
Let me see the device

1171
01:41:04,158 --> 01:41:04,988
好
Yup

1172
01:41:05,092 --> 01:41:06,252
就在这!
Exactly!

1173
01:41:11,465 --> 01:41:12,159
怎么了 德万?
What's happened, Dewan?

1174
01:41:12,232 --> 01:41:14,200
大桥中央发现了炸弹
Sir, it's bang in the centre of the bridge

1175
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:15,130
带计时器?
Any timer?

1176
01:41:15,235 --> 01:41:18,363
炸药与计时器通过电线相连
Yes, sir, and the wires go to the dynamite through the relay

1177
01:41:18,739 --> 01:41:20,366
电线缠绕在装炸药的罐子外面
They're wrapped around cans filled with Anfo

1178
01:41:20,507 --> 01:41:21,371
知道了
Ya

1179
01:41:22,576 --> 01:41:24,567
哎 大记者
Oye Kurusawa,

1180
01:41:25,746 --> 01:41:28,442
是时候实现你的梦想了
come fulfill your passion

1181
01:41:32,319 --> 01:41:33,308
太棒了!
Wow great!

1182
01:41:40,461 --> 01:41:41,758
你不怕?
You're not scared?

1183
01:41:42,729 --> 01:41:45,061
我身边这位可是"不死传奇"呢
I'm hanging here with 'The man who cannot die',

1184
01:41:45,866 --> 01:41:47,128
货真价实!
Literally!

1185
01:41:47,534 --> 01:41:49,468
我用不着害怕
There's no chance of being scared,

1186
01:41:49,636 --> 01:41:52,537
老大 你生来就是拆弹高手
your destiny is working on a strike rate of 100%, boss

1187
01:41:53,006 --> 01:41:56,066
我们这种工作 一次失手就在劫难逃
In our line of work destiny betrays you just once

1188
01:41:56,610 --> 01:41:59,044
别怕 不会是今天
Don't worry, today's not that day,

1189
01:41:59,246 --> 01:42:02,044
因为我可不想这么快就死
'cause I have no plans of dying so quickly

1190
01:42:02,182 --> 01:42:04,377
我还要做很多纪录片呢
I have to make many more documentaries

1191
01:42:04,485 --> 01:42:06,282
让全世界都看到
and show them in every country in the world,

1192
01:42:06,386 --> 01:42:09,287
我还要跟世界各地的帅哥上床
I have to have sex with guys with different accents

1193
01:42:10,124 --> 01:42:12,092
你是读着性爱圣经长大的吗?
Did you grow up reading the Kama Sutra?

1194
01:42:12,326 --> 01:42:13,918
满脑子里都是这些东西?
Is this all you think of?

1195
01:42:13,994 --> 01:42:17,452
兵哥 我这个年龄段的人就这样
Soldier, at my age,this is all we think of

1196
01:42:17,531 --> 01:42:20,125
我长到你那么大时 才会思考到底什么是爱
When I grow older like you,I'll start thinking of love,

1197
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:24,466
做一个好市民 以及朝圣之类的 明白?
being a good citizen,the ways of God, okay?

1198
01:42:24,872 --> 01:42:25,964
随便
Okay 

1199
01:42:29,510 --> 01:42:31,102
顺便问下 兵哥
By the way, soldier,

1200
01:42:31,578 --> 01:42:34,445
你这辈子就只爱米拉一个吗?
do you plan on being in love with Meera all your life,

1201
01:42:34,548 --> 01:42:36,880
你还有没有可能爱上别人?
or is there a chance for someone else in between?

1202
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:42,655
我忽然想到个好主意 你想知道吗?
There's a mind blowing offer,do you want to hear it?

1203
01:42:43,657 --> 01:42:44,282
我有的选吗?
Is there a choice?

1204
01:42:44,424 --> 01:42:45,152
没有
No

1205
01:42:45,392 --> 01:42:46,654
让我当你的女朋友吧
Make me your girlfriend

1206
01:42:48,462 --> 01:42:49,326
为什么?
Why?

1207
01:42:49,663 --> 01:42:53,326
我年轻... 幽默... 又性感
I'm young... I'm entertaining...I'm sexy,

1208
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:55,195
你已经见识过我的身材了
you've already checked my body out,

1209
01:42:55,302 --> 01:42:57,702
事实上 我是你的无上之选
actually I'm like a jackpot for you

1210
01:42:57,804 --> 01:42:59,863
机会仅此一次... 考虑下啦
it's a limited offer... think about it

1211
01:43:04,011 --> 01:43:07,606
兵哥 兵哥 听着...
Soldier, soldier, listen...

1212
01:43:09,449 --> 01:43:12,077
我从未向上帝祈求过什么
I never ask God for anything,

1213
01:43:12,286 --> 01:43:13,548
我的承诺仅此一点
so by making promises and all

1214
01:43:13,620 --> 01:43:15,952
我绝不要离开你
and leaving you is out of the question

1215
01:43:21,795 --> 01:43:23,922
我把你逗笑了 你是我的人啦
I made you laugh, you're mine now

1216
01:43:56,830 --> 01:44:04,737
# 我带着梦想的翅膀飞离 #

01:47:06,119 --> 01:47:08,587
# 张开双臂拥抱生活 #
Embracing life with open arms

1235
01:47:35,582 --> 01:47:37,072
萨马・阿南德少校
So Major Samar Anand,

1236
01:47:37,784 --> 01:47:39,911
此行的最后一个问题
the last question of our trip,

1237
01:47:40,854 --> 01:47:43,015
怎么你从来都不穿防爆服?
why haven't you worn a bomb suit till now?

1238
01:47:45,659 --> 01:47:46,387
呃...
Um...

1239
01:47:48,028 --> 01:47:50,360
防爆服是为了能让你远离危险
Bomb suits are meant to protect you from danger,

1240
01:47:51,364 --> 01:47:54,492
远离伤害 伤痛
to protect you from getting hurt, or being wounded,

1241
01:47:56,002 --> 01:47:57,970
但能伤到你的不是炸弹 而是生活
but more than bombs it's life, that hurts you,

1242
01:47:59,639 --> 01:48:03,302
每个角落都上演着背叛 痛苦...
at every corner there's betrayal, some pain...

1243
01:48:05,979 --> 01:48:09,779
如果不穿防爆服能把我们从困境中解救出来
so if we don't wear bomb suits to save us from the dangers of life,

1244
01:48:11,351 --> 01:48:13,819
穿着它徒然求生又有什么意义?
what's the point of wearing it to save us from death?

1245
01:48:16,022 --> 01:48:18,718
生活一天天地将我们消磨
Every day, life kills us a little,

1246
01:48:19,860 --> 01:48:22,158
炸弹才能让你一了百了
a bomb will kill us just once

1247
01:48:31,371 --> 01:48:33,931
好了 兵哥 完事啦
Okay soldier, that's a wrap,

1248
01:48:34,407 --> 01:48:37,638
影片拍好了 也不用再折磨你了
the end of my film and your torture

1249
01:48:44,551 --> 01:48:46,178
你这是在打量我吗?
Are you checking me out?

1250
01:48:46,686 --> 01:48:49,484
我在想以前对你的看法是多么的错误
I was thinking how wrong I was about you

1251
01:48:49,956 --> 01:48:52,686
我以前认为你熬不过两天的
I'd thought that you wouldn't last more than two days with us,

1252
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:55,721
但你却是个真正的强者
but you turned to be really tough boss

1253
01:48:56,329 --> 01:48:58,923
你以前有问过我的事吗?
Have you ever asked me anything about myself?

1254
01:48:59,032 --> 01:49:01,227
你总是这副抓狂的表情
All you gave were intense angry looks

1255
01:49:01,535 --> 01:49:05,130
我是国家级游泳运动员 州级网球运动员
I'm a national level swimmer, a state level tennis player,

1256
01:49:05,372 --> 01:49:07,465
我四分钟可以跑一千米
I can run a kilometer in four minutes,

1257
01:49:07,707 --> 01:49:08,765
我还是名深海潜水员
I'm a deep sea diver,

1258
01:49:08,875 --> 01:49:10,968
基本上我是超女啦 什么事我都能做到
basically I'm Super Girl, make me do anything

1259
01:49:11,611 --> 01:49:14,671
就没有你做不到的事吗?
So, there's nothing that you can't do?

1260
01:49:16,216 --> 01:49:17,513
还真有件
There's one thing

1261
01:49:18,785 --> 01:49:19,717
什么?
What?

1262
01:49:20,854 --> 01:49:22,344
我无法让你爱上我
I couldn't make you fall for me

1263
01:49:22,722 --> 01:49:25,213
真是 你又开始说笑了
There, you've started again

1264
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:28,755
我已经爱上你了 萨马
I'm in love with you, Samar

1265
01:49:35,235 --> 01:49:38,796
完全地 彻底地 疯狂地
Totally, completely, madly,

1266
01:49:39,973 --> 01:49:41,565
亚基拉已深深地爱上了你
Akira has fallen flat in love with you

1267
01:49:48,448 --> 01:49:50,040
你没必要说什么
There's no need to say anything,

1268
01:49:50,650 --> 01:49:53,065
我知道你对我完全没有兴趣 
I know you're not at all interested, 

1269
01:49:53,066 --> 01:49:54,552
这... 没事啦
and it's... it's totally cool

1270
01:49:55,889 --> 01:49:58,380
迄今为止 都是男生围着我转
Until now, boys have always run after me,

1271
01:49:59,025 --> 01:50:00,925
我从未主动过
I've never run after anybody,

1272
01:50:04,764 --> 01:50:06,789
你很特别
but you're this special piece, ya

1273
01:50:08,134 --> 01:50:11,194
同龄人中 我再也找不到一个像你这样的情人
In my generation I'll never find a lover like you,

1274
01:50:12,205 --> 01:50:14,139
我既然遇见了你
and now that I've met you,

1275
01:50:14,708 --> 01:50:16,733
就无力再爱上别人
I can't love someone lesser than you,

1276
01:50:18,378 --> 01:50:22,007
换句话说 芳心彻底被你俘获啦 大佬
so basically, I'm screwed, boss

1277
01:50:37,130 --> 01:50:39,189
你说话的口气和我一样
You deliver dialogues just like me,

1278
01:50:39,666 --> 01:50:40,462
只是...
just...

1279
01:50:41,635 --> 01:50:43,398
不要像我那样为爱痴狂...
don't end up falling in love like me...

1280
01:50:47,173 --> 01:50:49,278
因为如果你的笑容不再 
because if your laughter, 

1281
01:50:49,279 --> 01:50:51,576
也不再耍小性子 不再吵闹
this mischief, this abusive language, stops,

1282
01:50:54,881 --> 01:50:56,940
这世界就更无趣了
this world will surely lose something

1283
01:51:18,438 --> 01:51:21,100
怎么会哭呢?
Where do these come from?

1284
01:51:24,310 --> 01:51:25,106
克里斯南  !
Krishnan!

1285
01:51:25,178 --> 01:51:26,338
再会 亚基拉
See you, Akira

1286
01:51:27,013 --> 01:51:28,105
德万!
Dewan!

1287
01:51:30,917 --> 01:51:32,111
再见 辛格
Bye Singh

1288
01:51:32,285 --> 01:51:33,274
保重 亚基拉
Take care, Akira

1289
01:51:43,396 --> 01:51:45,762
别担心 我不会哭的
Don't worry, I'm not going to cry

1290
01:51:45,865 --> 01:51:48,197
我知道 你可是超女呢
Ya ya, I know, you're super girl

1291
01:51:48,268 --> 01:51:49,565
那是
That I am

1292
01:51:52,972 --> 01:51:54,496
照顾好自己
Take care of yourself,

1293
01:51:55,275 --> 01:51:56,674
别死掉了
don't die or anything like that

1294
01:51:56,976 --> 01:51:59,069
要不然我们就真成悲惨爱情故事了
ours is going to be a deadly love story

1295
01:51:59,345 --> 01:52:00,505
你不要因我而改变
You're not going to change

1296
01:52:01,748 --> 01:52:03,375
太晚了
There's no chance

1297
01:52:07,987 --> 01:52:09,215
我可不要友谊式的拥抱
I don't want these friendly hugs,

1298
01:52:09,355 --> 01:52:10,652
如果你要亲我 那就来吧
if you want to kiss me, then do that

1299
01:52:29,342 --> 01:52:30,502
这算吻吗?
This was a kiss?

1300
01:52:31,010 --> 01:52:32,477
那是战友间的亲吻
That's how the army's taught us

1301
01:52:33,213 --> 01:52:34,180
等着我
You wait,

1302
01:52:34,481 --> 01:52:36,711
等我回来 给你展示什么才是真正的亲吻
Iet me come back, and show you how to kiss for real

1303
01:52:36,816 --> 01:52:37,680
真的?
Really?

1304
01:52:39,352 --> 01:52:40,819
再会...
I'll see you...

1305
01:52:56,503 --> 01:52:58,630
好啦 我们一小时后还要赶去巴拉穆拉
Come on, we have to reach Baramullah in one hour

1306
01:52:58,938 --> 01:53:00,371
别让自己情绪失控
control your emotions

1307
01:53:01,274 --> 01:53:03,299
否则就无法胜任排爆工作了
otherwise the bomb will be out of control

1308
01:53:14,854 --> 01:53:18,551
如果不穿防爆服能把我们从困境解救中出来
So if we don't wear bomb suits to save us from the dangers of life,

1309
01:53:20,260 --> 01:53:22,728
穿着它徒然求生又有什么意义?
what's the point of wearing it to save us from death?

1310
01:53:24,898 --> 01:53:27,458
生活一天天地将我们消磨
every day, life kills us a little,

1311
01:53:28,668 --> 01:53:30,636
炸弹才能让你一了百了
a bomb will kill us just once

1312
01:53:49,789 --> 01:53:51,882
你把我这种铁石心肠的人都感动哭了!
You made the bitch cry!

1313
01:53:54,594 --> 01:53:55,822
大爱呀!
I love it!

1314
01:53:56,329 --> 01:53:57,796
我保证他们会把这播出去
I'm going to make sure they run this

1315
01:54:00,567 --> 01:54:03,968
你个蠢货在我改变主意之前赶紧滚开
Get off me you stupid girl before I change my mind

1316
01:54:04,070 --> 01:54:06,231
我们会将它命名为"不死传奇"
We are going to title it 'The Man Who Cannot Die'

1317
01:54:06,306 --> 01:54:08,137
我要把它排在九月版的头条
I want it to be the lead for the September issue,

1318
01:54:08,241 --> 01:54:09,833
亚基拉 让他搭个航班
so Akira, put him on a flight

1319
01:54:09,943 --> 01:54:11,046
尽快把他带到伦敦
and get him to London as soon as possible,

1320
01:54:11,578 --> 01:54:13,637
上层想要证实他故事的真实性
the big boys will want to authenticate his story

1321
01:54:13,746 --> 01:54:15,008
他一定得亲自过来吗?
Does he have to come here for that?

1322
01:54:15,114 --> 01:54:16,672
我是说 我们不能就在他的驻地完成吗?
I mean, can't we just do this there?

1323
01:54:16,783 --> 01:54:19,149
因为你是新手 不能 就把他带过来
For a story done by a rookie, no, just get him here

1324
01:54:19,219 --> 01:54:20,516
他是不会来的
He won't come!

1325
01:54:21,254 --> 01:54:22,551
怎么会不来?
Why the hell not?

1326
01:54:22,655 --> 01:54:24,919
他就是不会
He just won't

1327
01:54:25,291 --> 01:54:27,486
听着 虽然我不是老板
Listen girl, I don't run this company

1328
01:54:27,560 --> 01:54:30,085
但是我保证要是他不来的话
but I do know that if he doesn't get his arse over here,

1329
01:54:30,196 --> 01:54:32,164
你的报道就只能被束之高阁了
your story stays in the edit room,

1330
01:54:32,398 --> 01:54:34,889
给你二十四小时 带他来见我
you've got 24 hours to get back to me

1331
01:54:40,840 --> 01:54:42,137
上帝保佑吧!
In the name of God!

1332
01:54:42,642 --> 01:54:47,170
兵哥 他们看了纪录片 被打动了
Soldier, they've flipped it after seeing your story,

1333
01:54:47,447 --> 01:54:50,610
他们想把它做成九月版的主打故事
they want to make it the cover story for the September issue

1334
01:54:50,783 --> 01:54:53,115
还答应和我签约 起薪二万五千英镑啊
and sign me for a starting salary of 25 thousand quid

1335
01:54:53,186 --> 01:54:55,120
为期三年
and a three-3 year contract

1336
01:54:55,188 --> 01:54:57,179
恭喜 超女
Okay congratulations, super girl

1337
01:54:57,657 --> 01:54:59,557
我死之前 你还让我火了一把啊
you made me famous before I died

1338
01:55:00,093 --> 01:55:01,390
但是 兵哥...
But soldier...

1339
01:55:02,662 --> 01:55:05,495
有个小问题
there's a small... problem

1340
01:55:06,799 --> 01:55:08,460
你能有什么问题?
What problem can you have?

1341
01:55:08,935 --> 01:55:12,462
问题就是那个报道 签约
The problem is that this story, this contract,

1342
01:55:12,906 --> 01:55:17,900
这些 前提是你要来次伦敦
all this, will happen only if you come to London

1343
01:55:20,980 --> 01:55:23,881
这是我第一份报道 我是新人
This is my first story and I'm new,

1344
01:55:24,384 --> 01:55:27,876
所以这是他们约定俗成的惯例
so it's their system it can't be changed

1345
01:55:28,988 --> 01:55:30,819
就一天啦 兵哥
It's only for one day, soldier,

1346
01:55:30,890 --> 01:55:33,017
我保证 二十四个小时后你就又回印度了
in twenty- four hours you'll be back in lndia, I promise

1347
01:55:37,931 --> 01:55:39,762
我知道你也挺为难的
I know it's not easy for you,

1348
01:55:40,133 --> 01:55:41,862
但这是我人生的转折点
but my life is at stake here,

1349
01:55:42,201 --> 01:55:45,261
这会让我事业至少快进五年
my career will get at least a 5 year kick start,

1350
01:55:45,939 --> 01:55:48,430
求求你啦 兵哥哥 就为我!
please soldier, for me!

1351
01:55:52,178 --> 01:55:53,270
我去不了!
I can't come!

1352
01:55:55,315 --> 01:55:56,509
抱歉 亚基拉!
Sorry Akira!

1353
01:55:57,684 --> 01:55:58,708
没事的
It's okay

1354
01:56:09,329 --> 01:56:10,921
他个混蛋!
What an arsehole!

1355
01:56:11,764 --> 01:56:13,197
他不是混蛋 约翰
He's not an arsehole, John

1356
01:56:13,366 --> 01:56:14,924
那是怎么回事?
So what's his problem then?

1357
01:56:16,336 --> 01:56:20,705
他只是... 有烦心事 说来话长啦
He's just... messed up, it's a long story

1358
01:56:21,307 --> 01:56:22,467
那你要回去吗?
Are you heading back?

1359
01:56:23,476 --> 01:56:25,239
是呀
Ya, I mean,

1360
01:56:25,311 --> 01:56:27,677
这一周来 凯瑟琳一直在尝试说服领导们
it's been a week since Catherine's been trying to convince the bosses,

1361
01:56:27,780 --> 01:56:29,543
但是... 没用呀
but... it's not working,

1362
01:56:30,149 --> 01:56:32,640
所以我猜我要回德里去了
so I guess I'm back to Delhi's belly

1363
01:56:33,286 --> 01:56:34,947
真是个混蛋!
What an arsehole!

1364
01:56:40,493 --> 01:56:41,221
喂?
Hello?

1365
01:56:41,327 --> 01:56:43,420
你们这探索频道是有多少办公室呀?
How many offices do these Discovery Channel guys have?

1366
01:56:43,529 --> 01:56:46,191
我这有个岔路 真不知道要往哪边走
I am standing at a cross road, I can't understand where to go

1367
01:56:46,532 --> 01:56:47,191
你在哪?
Where are you?

1368
01:56:47,266 --> 01:56:49,234
探索频道办公室附近
I am standing somewhere near the Discovery Channel office,

1369
01:56:49,335 --> 01:56:50,700
这些房子看起来没啥区别
all the buildings look the same

1370
01:56:50,970 --> 01:56:53,404
你 就在那等着 我马上来
You, you wait right there, I'm coming

1371
01:56:53,773 --> 01:56:55,764
他... 来... 啦!
He... is... here!

1372
01:56:55,842 --> 01:56:57,742
我就说他不是混蛋吧
I told you he is not an arsehole

1373
01:57:30,309 --> 01:57:31,333
抱歉
Sorry

1374
01:57:36,349 --> 01:57:38,510
谢谢你 兵哥 谢谢
Thank you soldier, thank you,

1375
01:57:38,618 --> 01:57:40,848
太谢谢啦 兵哥哥
Thank you soldier,

1376
01:57:43,723 --> 01:57:46,521
我知道 你能来伦敦真是不容易 
it's a big deal that you've come to London, I know this,

1377
01:57:47,427 --> 01:57:51,488
你能为我而来 真是我人生中的幸事
but that you've come here for me is the biggest thing in my life

1378
01:57:51,564 --> 01:57:54,192
别在这自恋了 我又不是为你而来
Don't get sentimental, I haven't come for you,

1379
01:57:54,267 --> 01:57:56,531
我就顺便来看看你
I've come to set you here, permanently,

1380
01:57:56,736 --> 01:57:59,102
然后我能永远地摆脱你了
so that I'm free from you for forever

1381
01:57:59,205 --> 01:58:01,639
休想 兵哥
No chance, soldier,

1382
01:58:01,874 --> 01:58:04,968
以前这故事只是一厢情愿
so far this story has been one - sided,

1383
01:58:05,078 --> 01:58:08,138
现在看来又有新转机啦
now it looks like there's going to be a twist in the story

1384
01:58:08,347 --> 01:58:09,336
亚基拉!!
Akira!!

1385
01:58:24,697 --> 01:58:25,891
让下 让下
Move, move

1386
01:58:27,133 --> 01:58:31,069
萨马 萨马 你能听见我吗
Samar, Samar, can you hear me,

1387
01:58:31,137 --> 01:58:32,729
萨马... 你是医生吗?
Samar... are you a doctor?

1388
01:58:33,940 --> 01:58:35,168
拜托帮忙联系医生 好吗?
Can someone please call a doctor?

1389
01:58:35,274 --> 01:58:36,901
拜托帮忙叫下救护车 好吗?
Can someone please call an ambulance?

1390
01:58:36,976 --> 01:58:38,841
萨马 萨马 萨马
Samar, Samar, Samar,

1391
01:58:40,446 --> 01:58:41,743
我该怎么办?
What do I do?

1392
01:58:42,648 --> 01:58:43,205
萨马!
Samar!

1393
01:59:08,241 --> 01:59:11,301
醒醒 打扰下 他想见你
Excuse me, sorry he's asking for you

1394
01:59:29,495 --> 01:59:30,154
米拉在哪?
Where's Meera?

1395
01:59:36,903 --> 01:59:38,302
没事了 萨马
It's okay, Samar

1396
01:59:41,707 --> 01:59:44,107
你能帮我叫下米拉...
Can you call Meera please...

1397
01:59:46,379 --> 01:59:48,939
那个护士说她在外面等我
the other nurse said she is waiting outside for me...

1398
01:59:49,081 --> 01:59:52,175
你可以帮我叫她... 帮我叫她过来
Will you call her... will you call her please

1399
01:59:53,519 --> 01:59:55,885
护士... 你能帮我叫米拉过来吗?
Nurse... will you please call Meera?

1400
01:59:55,988 --> 01:59:57,425
你刚说她在外面等我 
you said she is waiting for me... 

1401
01:59:57,426 --> 01:59:59,151
我... 我现在就要见她
I...... I need to see her now...

1402
01:59:59,225 --> 02:00:00,351
你怎么不凑近一点?
Why aren't you going to him?

1403
02:00:00,426 --> 02:00:01,893
我要见她
I need to see her

1404
02:00:01,994 --> 02:00:03,325
我不是米拉!
I'm not Meera!

1405
02:00:04,664 --> 02:00:05,653
怎么了!
What's wrong!

1406
02:00:05,731 --> 02:00:06,755
怎么你们不去叫 米拉?
Why aren't you calling Meera?

1407
02:00:06,866 --> 02:00:08,060
去叫汗医生
Go get Dr. Khan

1408
02:00:09,035 --> 02:00:10,127
她没事吧?
Is she okay?

1409
02:00:10,236 --> 02:00:11,965
她是不是出事了?
Has something happened to her?

1410
02:00:12,138 --> 02:00:13,571
怎么你们都不说话?
Why aren't you saying something?

1411
02:00:13,639 --> 02:00:15,004
拜托了 我...
please, l...

1412
02:00:16,175 --> 02:00:17,767
帮我去叫米拉
Call Meera please

1413
02:00:17,843 --> 02:00:19,811
我要见她
I need to see Meera

1414
02:00:51,844 --> 02:00:53,311
早上好 萨马!
Good morning, Samar!

1415
02:00:53,980 --> 02:00:56,107
我是佐雅・阿里・汗医生
I'm Dr. Zoya Ali Khan,

1416
02:00:56,182 --> 02:00:58,172
昨晚是我为你做的手术 
Last night I operated on you, 

1417
02:00:58,173 --> 02:00:59,982
你现在感觉怎么样了?
how are you feeling now?

1418
02:01:00,052 --> 02:01:00,950
嗯
Hmm

1419
02:01:03,122 --> 02:01:04,680
全名?
Full name?

1420
02:01:05,191 --> 02:01:06,658
萨马・阿南德
Samar Anand

1421
02:01:06,826 --> 02:01:07,918
年龄?
Age?

1422
02:01:08,160 --> 02:01:09,650
二十八岁
28 years

1423
02:01:13,432 --> 02:01:15,900
今年是哪一年 萨马?
What year are we in, Samar?

1424
02:01:17,470 --> 02:01:18,630
2002年
2002

1425
02:01:25,444 --> 02:01:28,007
在这之前萨马有发生过意外
Has Samar been in an accident 

1426
02:01:28,008 --> 02:01:30,143
或遭受过严重创伤吗?
or gone through serious trauma before this?

1427
02:01:31,450 --> 02:01:36,149
十年前有过一次车祸 就在伦敦...
10 years ago there was an accident... here in London...

1428
02:01:36,489 --> 02:01:40,186
这是那次车祸后第一次回来
after that he's come back to London for the first time

1429
02:01:40,559 --> 02:01:42,322
那就说得通了
That explains it,

1430
02:01:43,629 --> 02:01:46,894
萨马患的是逆行性遗忘
Samar is suffering from retrograde amnesia

1431
02:01:46,966 --> 02:01:49,400
他的记忆倒退了十年
he has regressed ten years,

1432
02:01:49,735 --> 02:01:53,501
他的记忆 停留在了2002年
his memory, is stuck in the year 2002

1433
02:01:55,808 --> 02:01:57,503
这次车祸所造成的创伤
the trauma of this accident has

1434
02:01:57,610 --> 02:02:01,068
使他的记忆倒退到上次的车祸
regressed his memory to the previous accident,

1435
02:02:01,514 --> 02:02:04,176
他记得那车祸之前的所有事
he remembers everything up until the previous accident,

1436
02:02:04,383 --> 02:02:07,147
但是之后的事他就没有印象了
but after that he remembers nothing

1437
02:02:09,088 --> 02:02:12,216
那他会... 会康复的 对吧?
But he'll... become okay, won't he?

1438
02:02:13,859 --> 02:02:16,259
像这种情况 很难说
In cases like these, it's impossible to say,

1439
02:02:16,629 --> 02:02:21,066
有些患者在一天后就恢复记忆 但有些...
some patients get their memory back in a day and for some...

1440
02:02:21,133 --> 02:02:21,895
永远无法恢复!
never!

1441
02:02:26,906 --> 02:02:28,965
那 现在怎么办?
So... now?

1442
02:02:29,442 --> 02:02:33,344
首先我们要找来他以前认识的人
Firstly we will have to bring in the people he knew

1443
02:02:33,579 --> 02:02:36,377
当他和自己信任的人在一起时
when he is with the people he trusts,

1444
02:02:36,482 --> 02:02:39,713
会同时缓解他的紧张感与精神创伤
his shock and trauma will both lessen

1445
02:02:40,119 --> 02:02:42,485
那样也许我们能把他的记忆找回来
and then we might be able to bring him back

1446
02:02:43,189 --> 02:02:46,716
这是萨马提供的一些名字 地址和电话号码
These are some names, addresses and numbers, Samar has given,

1447
02:02:46,826 --> 02:02:49,090
我不知道这些是否仍然有效
I don't know if these are still valid,

1448
02:02:49,695 --> 02:02:52,357
但要是你尽量多找几个 总会有用...
but if you find as many as possible, it will help...

1449
02:02:52,431 --> 02:02:55,559
对了 这女孩是关键
and yes, the most important is this girl,

1450
02:02:55,634 --> 02:02:56,566
米拉!
Meera!

1451
02:02:57,036 --> 02:02:59,402
萨马从昨天开始就一直在找她
Samar's been asking for her, since yesterday

1452
02:03:08,848 --> 02:03:10,281
兵哥哥呀
Aye soldier,

1453
02:03:10,950 --> 02:03:14,613
怎么会那么戏剧化 就只把我忘了?
why so much drama, just to forget me?

1454
02:03:18,557 --> 02:03:20,218
但是现在你听着
but now you listen,

1455
02:03:20,726 --> 02:03:22,318
随你怎样
do what you want,

1456
02:03:23,095 --> 02:03:25,757
亚基拉是不会让你忘记她的
Akira won't let you forget her

1457
02:04:35,100 --> 02:04:37,933
宝贝 宝贝 看镜头
Honey, honey look into the camera

1458
02:04:39,738 --> 02:04:41,569
你们真漂亮
You look beautiful

1459
02:04:43,275 --> 02:04:44,674
嗨 爸爸
Hi daddy

1460
02:04:44,777 --> 02:04:45,903
嗨...
Hi...

1461
02:05:28,988 --> 02:05:30,148
米拉!
Meera!

1462
02:05:30,756 --> 02:05:31,848
啊?
Yes?

1463
02:05:31,957 --> 02:05:34,517
我要跟你谈谈...
I need to talk to you...

1464
02:05:35,494 --> 02:05:37,894
抱歉 我... 好像不认识你吧
I'm sorry l... can't seem to place you

1465
02:05:38,097 --> 02:05:41,032
对 我们是没见过
No... ya... um we've never met...

1466
02:05:41,700 --> 02:05:43,964
我是亚基拉... 几分钟就好
I'm Akira... I just need a few minutes

1467
02:05:44,236 --> 02:05:46,261
我真的是开会要迟到了
You know I'm extremely late for a meeting,

1468
02:05:46,372 --> 02:05:47,202
真是抱歉
I'm really sorry,

1469
02:05:47,273 --> 02:05:49,741
麻烦你先跟我的助理预约一下吧...
but would you mind making an appointment with my assistant...

1470
02:05:49,808 --> 02:05:51,503
真是抱歉!
I'm really sorry!

1471
02:05:53,445 --> 02:05:54,810
是关于萨马!
It's about Samar!

1472
02:06:08,827 --> 02:06:11,352
我知道你有难处...
I know how difficult this is for you...

1473
02:06:13,065 --> 02:06:15,898
你有幸福的家庭... 有丈夫...
you have a family... a husband...

1474
02:06:15,968 --> 02:06:17,196
还有女儿...
a daughter...

1475
02:06:18,437 --> 02:06:21,372
但是他除了你 一无所有
but beside you, there's no one else who can do this

1476
02:06:22,608 --> 02:06:25,236
萨马一直在找你
Samar keeps asking for you,

1477
02:06:26,111 --> 02:06:27,942
他就是想见你
he only wants to see you

1478
02:06:30,382 --> 02:06:33,010
医生觉得要是他能见你一次
The doctor feels if he see's you just once,

1479
02:06:33,218 --> 02:06:37,552
看到你 他也许能接受事实...
meets you, he might be able to hear the truth...

1480
02:06:39,091 --> 02:06:40,820
就一次 米拉...
just come once, Meera...

1481
02:06:41,827 --> 02:06:42,851
求求你了...
please...

1482
02:06:44,330 --> 02:06:45,354
为了萨马...
for Samar...

1483
02:06:52,571 --> 02:06:55,802
米拉 和萨马谈话你要特别注意
Meera, you'll have to handle Samar very carefully,

1484
02:06:55,975 --> 02:06:58,671
他的精神状态不稳定
his mental state is very delicate,

1485
02:06:58,777 --> 02:07:02,286
任何震惊或坏消息对他来说 
any kind of shock or bad news 

1486
02:07:02,287 --> 02:07:04,716
可能都是种永久伤害
could permanently damage his system

1487
02:07:04,917 --> 02:07:07,545
这样就更难以把他带回现实了
and then bringing him back may be impossible

1488
02:07:08,454 --> 02:07:11,116
还有米拉 要记住...
and Meera, just remember...

1489
02:07:11,557 --> 02:07:16,522
你是萨马通往外界的桥梁
you are the bridge that joins Samar to the outside world

1490
02:07:19,431 --> 02:07:20,420
准备好了吗?
Are you ready?

1491
02:07:20,532 --> 02:07:22,193
可以开始了吗?
Shall we do this?

1492
02:07:25,104 --> 02:07:26,036
很好!
Great!

1493
02:07:26,639 --> 02:07:28,732
我先去看看他 再叫你
I'll just check on him and call you

1494
02:07:35,814 --> 02:07:37,111
谢谢!
Thank you!

1495
02:07:53,365 --> 02:07:58,270
# 有你的身影浮现在我眼中 #
Seeing you makes me feel

1496
02:07:59,471 --> 02:08:04,273
# 远去的梦境再次重现 #
A departed dream returns to me

1497
02:08:08,580 --> 02:08:13,580
# 度过了如世纪般漫长的夜晚 #
Passing through that century-long night

1498
02:08:14,453 --> 02:08:19,153
# 清晨的曙光突现在我的眼帘 #
A burst of morning returns to me

1499
02:08:20,592 --> 02:08:32,299
# 神采飞扬 翻山越岭 #
Keeping awake, crossing miles

1500
02:08:32,871 --> 02:08:37,672
# 魂牵梦绕 #
The dream held me by the hand

1501
02:08:38,610 --> 02:08:43,608
# 我沉寂了这些许年月 #
Breath held for many years

1502
02:08:45,050 --> 02:08:47,780
# 如今终又重获新生 #
I can breathe again

1503
02:08:56,729 --> 02:09:01,066
# 只要你我的气息相生相伴 #
As my breath mingles with yours

1504
02:09:03,235 --> 02:09:05,795
# 我就仿若重获新生 #
I can breathe again

1505
02:09:35,300 --> 02:09:39,202
萨马 在车祸前你记得最后一件事是什么?
Samar, what's the last thing you remember before the accident?

1506
02:09:42,107 --> 02:09:43,005
米拉...
Meera...

1507
02:09:45,077 --> 02:09:47,739
米拉穿了件性感的粉色裙子...
Meera is dressed in a sexy pink dress...

1508
02:09:48,147 --> 02:09:49,444
披着头发...
her hair is open...

1509
02:09:49,782 --> 02:09:53,479
她微笑着... 看我表演摩托特技
she's smiling... watching me do stunts on my bike,

1510
02:09:54,686 --> 02:09:57,814
突然一辆车撞向我 然后...
and then suddenly a car slams into me and then...

1511
02:09:58,690 --> 02:09:59,486
眼前一片漆黑!
Black!

1512
02:10:00,192 --> 02:10:01,386
整个世界都是如此!
Full black!

1513
02:10:05,898 --> 02:10:10,859
萨马 你刚说的车祸发生在十年前
Samar, the accident you are talking about happened ten years ago

1514
02:10:12,571 --> 02:10:16,439
现在不是2002年 现在是2012年
and we're not in 2002, we are in the year 2012

1515
02:10:18,777 --> 02:10:20,142
什么!
What!

1516
02:10:22,881 --> 02:10:25,179
米拉... 这... ?
Meera... this... ?

1517
02:10:25,284 --> 02:10:26,308
萨马!
Samar!

1518
02:10:27,519 --> 02:10:28,679
先听她说
Just listen to her

1519
02:10:28,854 --> 02:10:30,116
我来解释一下
Let me explain,

1520
02:10:30,189 --> 02:10:34,182
萨马你因头部受伤而导致部分记忆缺失
Samar because of the head injury you have amnesia,

1521
02:10:34,426 --> 02:10:36,053
逆行性遗忘
Retrograde amnesia

1522
02:10:36,361 --> 02:10:38,761
这在头部创伤中非常常见
and it is very common with head injuries

1523
02:10:39,064 --> 02:10:40,964
所以别担心
so please don't worry,

1524
02:10:41,266 --> 02:10:43,894
随着时间的推移 你会慢慢记起一切
with time you will remember everything,

1525
02:10:44,036 --> 02:10:46,197
你会完全康复的
and you will become absolutely okay

1526
02:10:47,039 --> 02:10:50,668
我知道你有很多疑问
I know you have a lot of questions that you want answers for

1527
02:10:51,643 --> 02:10:53,110
米拉会陪着你
Meera is with you

1528
02:10:53,178 --> 02:10:57,877
有需要就随时叫我 我就在外面 好吗?
and whenever you need me. I'm right outside, okay?

1529
02:11:01,186 --> 02:11:02,551
待会见
I'll see you

1530
02:11:12,231 --> 02:11:14,529
我无法理解 米拉...
I don't understand, Meera...

1531
02:11:15,868 --> 02:11:17,062
十年了...
10 years...

1532
02:11:19,504 --> 02:11:20,562
已经十年了!
10 years!!

1533
02:11:22,007 --> 02:11:23,668
萨马 没事的...
Samar It's ok...

1534
02:11:24,643 --> 02:11:25,803
没事的...
it's ok...

1535
02:11:28,614 --> 02:11:30,946
我们在一起十年了?
We've been together for 10 years?

1536
02:11:38,924 --> 02:11:41,324
我们结婚多久了?
How long have we been married?

1537
02:11:47,165 --> 02:11:48,598
五年
Five years

1538
02:11:53,505 --> 02:11:55,530
我想要记起每件事..
I want to remember everything...

1539
02:11:56,942 --> 02:11:59,274
记起和你一起度过的每分每秒...
everyday, every second I've spent with you...

1540
02:11:59,344 --> 02:12:01,244
我想要记起所有的事...
I want to remember everything...

1541
02:12:01,880 --> 02:12:04,974
我... 我想记起所有的事...
I... I want to remember everything...

1542
02:12:16,261 --> 02:12:19,162
不 米拉 可以了...
No, ya Meera, no more...

1543
02:12:20,265 --> 02:12:22,062
你已经做了很多了
you've already done so much and

1544
02:12:22,234 --> 02:12:24,031
要你再花时间
to ask you for more of your time,

1545
02:12:24,102 --> 02:12:25,467
在这些事情上
to do all this drama

1546
02:12:26,705 --> 02:12:28,104
我觉得心里有愧
I don't feel right

1547
02:12:29,274 --> 02:12:32,300
你有你的家庭 你老公 还有女儿
you have a family, a husband, a daughter

1548
02:12:32,411 --> 02:12:33,605
亚基拉...
Akira...

1549
02:12:36,448 --> 02:12:37,779
我没结婚
I'm not married

1550
02:12:43,622 --> 02:12:45,647
我也没有女儿...		
And nor do I have any daughter...

1551
02:12:52,664 --> 02:12:54,894
我许诺离开萨马
I made a promise to leave Samar,

1552
02:12:56,802 --> 02:12:58,565
不是去结婚...
not to get married...

1553
02:13:01,306 --> 02:13:05,265
罗杰是老朋友了 一生一世的老朋友
Roger is an old friend and has always remained a friend

1554
02:13:06,378 --> 02:13:07,310
他离婚了 所以...
He is divorced so...

1555
02:13:07,412 --> 02:13:10,279
我每年都帮他安排他女儿的生日派对
every year I help him arrange his daughter's birthday

1556
02:13:13,352 --> 02:13:15,946
我不忍心看到萨马这样
I can't bear to see Samar like this,

1557
02:13:17,823 --> 02:13:20,758
我想尽我所能去帮他
and I want to do whatever I can,

1558
02:13:23,462 --> 02:13:25,862
但是我要先告诉你
but before that, it was necessary for me to tell you this

1559
02:13:29,935 --> 02:13:31,562
我爱萨马 亚基拉
I love Samar, Akira,

1560
02:13:34,206 --> 02:13:37,266
以前爱他 以后也会一直爱他
always have, always will,

1561
02:13:40,645 --> 02:13:42,840
但我永远不能和他在一起
but I can never be his

1562
02:13:46,018 --> 02:13:48,009
现在你都知道了
Now after knowing all this,

1563
02:13:48,520 --> 02:13:50,215
你要做什么...
what needs to be done...

1564
02:13:51,723 --> 02:13:53,020
全凭你决定
is up to you

1565
02:14:00,265 --> 02:14:02,028
萨马说得对
Samar was right,

1566
02:14:02,634 --> 02:14:06,468
我听了他的爱情故事 就该一笑置之
I should have left his love story as just a story and forgotten about it

1567
02:14:06,738 --> 02:14:08,097
我以前不这么感情用事... 
I was cool... 

1568
02:14:08,098 --> 02:14:09,263
我应该一直保持原样...
I would've remained cool,

1569
02:14:09,708 --> 02:14:14,270
但我爱他爱得太深 怎能随便放弃
but I got trapped in his love so much, now I can't let it go

1570
02:14:20,819 --> 02:14:23,814
来吧... 我们先接他出院 
Come... let's get him back 

1571
02:14:23,815 --> 02:14:26,382
然后再一起帮他找回记忆吧
and then beat him up together,

1572
02:14:35,567 --> 02:14:37,933
来瓶上好的智利红酒?
A nice bottle of Chilean Red?

1573
02:14:38,603 --> 02:14:40,230
当然...
Definitely, ya sure...

1574
02:14:41,773 --> 02:14:42,797
一切都好么 先生?
Is everything alright sir?

1575
02:14:42,908 --> 02:14:43,806
是的 很好 谢谢
Yes very well thank you

1576
02:14:43,909 --> 02:14:44,933
好的
Okay,

1577
02:14:46,711 --> 02:14:47,507
都还好么 夫人?
All okay ma'am?

1578
02:14:47,612 --> 02:14:48,977
嗯 谢谢
Hmm Thank you

1579
02:14:50,515 --> 02:14:53,006
玛利亚 史密斯夫人已经等了45分钟了
Maria, Mrs. Smith has been waiting for 45 minutes

1580
02:14:53,118 --> 02:14:55,143
如果她要吃玛利亚特别料理
If she's asked for Maria's special of the day

1581
02:14:55,220 --> 02:14:57,381
她就得花点时间等着
then she will have to wait for it to be special,

1582
02:14:57,489 --> 02:14:58,820
走开 别烦我了
now leave me alone

1583
02:14:58,990 --> 02:15:01,254
好吧 这就是跟一个白人结婚的...
Superb, here's getting married to a white...

1584
02:15:05,864 --> 02:15:07,058
米拉...
Meera...

1585
02:15:22,981 --> 02:15:27,647
扎因 如果你不愿意做的话就直说吧
Zain, if you can't do this feel free to say so,

1586
02:15:28,954 --> 02:15:31,354
我们知道这些要求可能太过分了
we realize that we're probably asking for a bit too much

1587
02:15:31,523 --> 02:15:32,490
过分?
Too much?

1588
02:15:33,258 --> 02:15:35,920
不 亚基拉 你们一点也不过分
No, Akira, you're asking for too little

1589
02:15:36,094 --> 02:15:39,860
这个餐厅 我的房子都是萨马的
This restaurant, my house all of it is Samar's

1590
02:15:40,031 --> 02:15:42,522
我是用他给我的钱开始创业的
... I started all this with the money that he gave me,

1591
02:15:42,834 --> 02:15:46,133
不然我这个拉合尔人怎么可能有这些成就?
otherwise how would this Lahori have done all this?

1592
02:15:47,772 --> 02:15:51,230
他告诉过我有一天他会来要他的那一份
He told me that he'd come one day to take his share

1593
02:15:52,210 --> 02:15:53,802
可不应该是这种方式...
but not like this...

1594
02:15:58,750 --> 02:16:00,183
你们别担心
You'll don't worry,

1595
02:16:00,385 --> 02:16:03,877
玛利亚和我会搬去温布利的老房子
Maria and I will shift into our old Wembley flat

1596
02:16:04,189 --> 02:16:06,885
餐厅 房子从现在起就是萨马的了
The restaurant, the house is all Samar's from now,

1597
02:16:07,192 --> 02:16:09,683
只要告诉我你们什么时候带他来
just tell me when are you bringing him

1598
02:16:09,828 --> 02:16:10,760
明天...
Tomorrow...

1599
02:16:11,630 --> 02:16:16,090
就像萨马以前说的那样 一言为定
So as Samar used to say, done, done, London...

1600
02:16:17,802 --> 02:16:18,928
一言为定
Done, done, London...

1601
02:16:19,437 --> 02:16:20,631
谢谢你 扎因
Thank you, Zain

1602
02:16:20,872 --> 02:16:22,362
不客气
Oh never mind

1603
02:16:37,155 --> 02:16:38,713
你在看什么?
What are you looking at?

1604
02:16:39,658 --> 02:16:40,522
伦敦...
London...

1605
02:16:41,092 --> 02:16:44,528
我们一年年老去 这座城市却越来越年轻
we're growing older but this city is getting younger

1606
02:16:47,532 --> 02:16:48,760
你怎么说的来着...
What were you saying...

1607
02:16:48,867 --> 02:16:50,562
我们有自己的餐厅?
we have our own restaurant?

1608
02:16:50,802 --> 02:16:52,861
是的 先生! 叫萨马之家
Yes, sir! Samar's Kitchen,

1609
02:16:53,004 --> 02:16:56,462
属于伦敦十大最佳餐厅之一
it's amongst the top 10 restaurants in London

1610
02:16:56,775 --> 02:16:58,834
我从来没想过 我们会有自己的餐厅
I'd never imagined, that we'd have our own restaurant,

1611
02:16:58,944 --> 02:17:00,571
小屋 还有车...
a bungalow, a car...

1612
02:17:01,479 --> 02:17:04,107
可能是上帝一不小心对我们太好了
Accidently God's been too kind. I think

1613
02:17:04,482 --> 02:17:06,313
所以他现在要拿点什么走
that's why He's making things even now

1614
02:17:06,384 --> 02:17:09,285
是啊 不过他只是想让你休息一下 别多想
Oye, He is letting you rest for a while, nothing else

1615
02:17:09,454 --> 02:17:11,854
不要太情绪化了 不然我们又要出意外了
Don't get too emotional or we'll meet with another accident

1616
02:17:13,391 --> 02:17:15,382
其他的我都能理解
Everything else I can understand

1617
02:17:15,560 --> 02:17:17,528
只有一件事我很纳闷
One thing I can't understand,

1618
02:17:18,630 --> 02:17:20,427
你是怎么勾搭上玛利亚的?
is how did you hook Maria?

1619
02:17:22,534 --> 02:17:27,130
巴帕帅...巴基斯坦的帕坦人的魅力
PPK... Pakistani Pathan's charisma

1620
02:17:27,572 --> 02:17:30,507
所以你现在是"拉合尔之光"了
So now Lahore's famous because of you

1621
02:17:40,285 --> 02:17:43,015
到了 我们到家了
Here you go, we've come home

1622
02:18:00,272 --> 02:18:02,968
米拉 好好照顾你的宝贝
Meera, here, take care of your prized possession,

1623
02:18:03,141 --> 02:18:06,133
我和玛利亚明天再来... 拜拜
I will come with Maria tomorrow... bye

1624
02:18:31,636 --> 02:18:33,536
现在你不管耶稣大人了
Now you've left Sir Jesus

1625
02:18:33,905 --> 02:18:35,736
开始转拜克里希纳神了...
and you're making deals with Shree Krishna...

1626
02:18:33,905 --> 02:18:35,736
{\an8}克里希纳：印度主神之一 意译为“黑天”

1627
02:18:35,807 --> 02:18:37,274
不然我怎么办啊
So what should I do,

1628
02:18:37,842 --> 02:18:40,504
如果你再出意外怎么办?
if you meet with one accident after another?

1629
02:18:40,745 --> 02:18:43,908
我得让各路神灵都高兴啊
I'll have to, keep all the Gods happy

1630
02:18:46,451 --> 02:18:49,545
不会再有意外了 我保证 好吧
No more accident's, I promise okay

1631
02:18:52,557 --> 02:18:55,856
来 老婆 带我看看我的家
Come, my wife, show me my home

1632
02:18:56,094 --> 02:18:58,722
就我们俩住这么大个房子
We live alone in such a big house,

1633
02:18:58,797 --> 02:19:00,662
还是与其他人合住啊?
or is there someone else on rent here?

1634
02:19:00,899 --> 02:19:01,797
哇哦
Wow

1635
02:19:02,200 --> 02:19:03,531
我们中过彩票么?
Did we win a lottery?

1636
02:19:32,230 --> 02:19:34,164
耶稣大人还灵验吗?
How is sir Jesus doing?

1637
02:19:35,066 --> 02:19:37,125
你祈祷的事情现在如何?
How are the deals coming along?

1638
02:19:38,536 --> 02:19:40,936
我不再祈求什么了
I've stopped making deals and vows

1639
02:19:42,273 --> 02:19:44,104
我现在什么都不要
Now I don't ask for anything of anybody

1640
02:19:44,175 --> 02:19:47,008
为什么会这样呢?
Wow, how did this happen?

1641
02:19:49,881 --> 02:19:51,439
我有你
I got you,

1642
02:19:53,118 --> 02:19:55,450
我再无他求了
so there is no need to ask for anything else

1643
02:20:05,697 --> 02:20:07,255
你这么爱我?
You love me that much?

1644
02:20:17,041 --> 02:20:18,065
怎么了?
What?

1645
02:20:19,944 --> 02:20:23,471
汗医生说 这些天都不能...
Doctor Khan has said, for a couple of days no...

1646
02:20:30,822 --> 02:20:31,789
天啊
Oh man

1647
02:20:32,190 --> 02:20:33,680
可是我伤的是头啊
But I've got injured on my head,

1648
02:20:33,925 --> 02:20:37,258
而且汗医生是神经学家又不是性科学家
and Dr Khan is a neurologist, not a sexologist

1649
02:20:38,563 --> 02:20:40,155
她肯定是个百合...
I think she's a lesbian...

1650
02:21:09,527 --> 02:21:10,585
米拉!
Meera!

1651
02:21:13,398 --> 02:21:14,524
到这里来
Come here

1652
02:21:30,114 --> 02:21:34,483
你是不是又变漂亮了?
Have you become more beautiful than before?

1653
02:21:41,726 --> 02:21:46,028
为什么我觉得好多年没见你了?
Why does it feel like I am meeting you after so many years?

1654
02:21:48,166 --> 02:21:50,293
好多年没摸过你了
Touching you after so many years

1655
02:21:55,306 --> 02:21:57,638
别别别 别走
No, no, no, stay here,

1656
02:21:59,511 --> 02:22:01,604
就这么抱着
just stay here

1657
02:22:05,116 --> 02:22:08,108
汗医生允许这样 对不?
Dr.Khan's allowed this much, hasn't she?

1658
02:23:37,508 --> 02:23:38,634
汗医生...
Dr.Khan...

1659
02:23:38,910 --> 02:23:42,141
成天念叨汗医生的嘱咐
Dr.Khan has become Changez Khan,

1660
02:23:42,313 --> 02:23:43,837
把她电话号码给我
give me her telephone number,

1661
02:23:44,015 --> 02:23:46,506
作为一个女人 她一点也不善解人意
being a woman, she doesn't have the heart of a mother

1662
02:23:58,529 --> 02:24:00,258
我做不下去了
I can't do this any more

1663
02:24:02,533 --> 02:24:04,125
我做不下去了
I can't do this any more

1664
02:24:08,072 --> 02:24:08,970
求你了 米拉...
Please, Meera...

1665
02:24:09,907 --> 02:24:11,772
再坚持几天...
just a few more days...

1666
02:24:12,543 --> 02:24:15,637
汗医生说萨马恢复得很好
Dr.Khan is saying that Samar is recovering very well,

1667
02:24:16,014 --> 02:24:18,505
他精神状态非常稳定
his mental condition is very stable

1668
02:24:18,950 --> 02:24:22,113
很快就会有能刺激他恢复记忆的事情发生了
and that very soon something may trigger his memory

1669
02:24:22,186 --> 02:24:24,177
我坚持不下去了 亚基拉
I can't go on, Akira,

1670
02:24:27,892 --> 02:24:29,553
医生 求求你...
doctor, please you...

1671
02:24:31,262 --> 02:24:32,661
我明白...
I understand...

1672
02:24:33,131 --> 02:24:34,098
真的
I do

1673
02:24:38,436 --> 02:24:42,304
理想的情况是两周之后再走这一步...
Ideally I wanted to take this step after two weeks...

1674
02:24:42,640 --> 02:24:44,733
不过也许现在就是个好时机...
but maybe this is the right time...

1675
02:24:45,410 --> 02:24:48,174
亚基拉 你去见萨马
Akira, you will meet Samar,

1676
02:24:48,780 --> 02:24:52,978
也许看到你他就什么都想起来了
maybe seeing you will trigger his memory immediately

1677
02:24:53,151 --> 02:24:55,517
虽然有点冒险
Yes, this is slightly risky

1678
02:24:55,953 --> 02:24:58,649
但目前这是我们最好的选择了
but at this point it is our best chance

1679
02:24:59,023 --> 02:25:00,532
我觉得是时候... 
I think it's time... 

1680
02:25:00,533 --> 02:25:03,551
让萨马・阿南德少校... 见见亚基拉了!
for Major Samar Anand... to meet Akira!

1681
02:25:06,631 --> 02:25:08,565
扎因 我不想去做这个访问
Zain, I don't want to do this interview,

1682
02:25:08,666 --> 02:25:09,724
你没必要逼我去
you're unnecessarily forcing me

1683
02:25:09,801 --> 02:25:11,826
萨马 这不是什么一般的访问
Samar, it's not just any interview,

1684
02:25:11,903 --> 02:25:13,700
这是探索频道啊 兄弟
these are the Discovery Channel guys,

1685
02:25:13,771 --> 02:25:17,207
他们要在伦敦寻访十个印度裔成功人士的故事
they're covering the success story of 10 lndians in London,

1686
02:25:17,308 --> 02:25:20,709
想想这对我们的餐厅是多好的宣传
imagine how good marketing it is for our restaurant

1687
02:25:20,778 --> 02:25:21,802
什么宣传!
What marketing!

1688
02:25:21,913 --> 02:25:23,073
干脆让我穿比基尼照些相片
Instead make me wear a bikini

1689
02:25:23,181 --> 02:25:24,512
然后把相片挂在餐厅外面好了
and put its photo outside the restaurant?

1690
02:25:24,582 --> 02:25:26,015
嘿 这主意也不错
Hey, that is also a good idea

1691
02:25:26,084 --> 02:25:28,348
你很兴奋嘛 帕坦人 巴帕帅
You're excited uh Pathan, PPK

1692

探索频道的工作人员

1697
02:25:43,801 --> 02:25:46,292

1708
02:27:10,021 --> 02:27:11,886
没! 没见过
No! I don't think so

1709
02:27:12,056 --> 02:27:14,991
对不起 我的记忆都休眠了
I'm sorry, my memory is on a long break

1710
02:27:15,092 --> 02:27:18,255
所以这些天很多人看起来都很熟悉
so these days every face looks familiar to me

1711
02:27:18,462 --> 02:27:19,451
没关系 萨马
It's okay, Samar,

1712
02:27:19,697 --> 02:27:21,597
我知道你的情况

别担心 我不会麻烦你太多的

1714
02:27:23,668 --> 02:27:24,930
不 不 不怕麻烦
No, no, no, please trouble me,

1715
02:27:25,002 --> 02:27:28,369
也许这些有助于我恢复记忆
maybe that might help trigger some lost memory

1716
02:27:29,841 --> 02:27:32,833
好吧 准备好应付麻烦吧
Okay then, get ready for the trouble

1717
02:27:32,910 --> 02:27:34,241
我打扮得还行?

1718
02:27:36,414 --> 02:27:37,346
-嗯 - 好
- Yeah - Yeah

我以前扫过雪

1722
02:27:43,054 --> 02:27:46,888
为杰克先生工作 四镑一小时

这里对我来说很特别
this is a very special place for me, 

1724
02:27:50,002 --> 02:27:51,420
你叫亚基拉...对吧?
uh Akira... right?

1725
02:27:52,263 --> 02:27:54,458
并不是因为这是我的第一份工作
Not because this was my first job,

1726
02:27:54,665 --> 02:27:57,634
而是因为我就是在这里与米拉邂逅的...
but because this is where I saw Meera for the first time...

1727
02:27:58,936 --> 02:27:59,994
就在这里
right there

1728
02:28:01,339 --> 02:28:03,000
她穿梭于飞舞的雪花中
In the middle of white snow,

1729
02:28:03,307 --> 02:28:05,673
好像红衣仙女一样飘过雪地
Like a fairy dressed in red, glide across the snow

1730
02:28:06,244 --> 02:28:08,178
只用了一秒 我就爱上了她...
It took one second and I fell flat for her...

1731
02:28:08,946 --> 02:28:11,437
你还没见过我老婆吧?
you haven't seen my wife, hmm?

1732
02:28:12,750 --> 02:28:15,116
她是世界上最美的女人
She's the world's most beautiful woman,

1733
02:28:15,586 --> 02:28:18,453
我不知道她怎么会爱上我这样一个小丑
I have no idea how she fell for a clown like me

1734
02:28:25,863 --> 02:28:29,264
哦哇哦 我超爱这种车

If it wasn't for Frank sir, I would probably have gone back to Punjab

1748
02:29:35,466 --> 02:29:38,958
然后像我爸爸和祖辈一样参军
and join the army like my father and forefathers

1749
02:29:41,072 --> 02:29:42,615
我从没告诉我妈

1750
02:29:42,616 --> 02:29:45,509
不过炸弹啊 枪啊 我真的好怕怕

1751
02:29:45,876 --> 02:29:47,503
弗兰克先生 他救了我

1764
02:30:19,910 --> 02:30:21,400
你怎么回事儿?
What is wrong with you?

1765
02:30:32,089 --> 02:30:36,082
# 这癫狂的流浪汉在寻找着什么? #
What does this crazy wanderer seek?

1766
02:30:36,394 --> 02:30:40,091
# 何处是我家? #
Where is my home?

1767
02:30:40,431 --> 02:30:43,298
# 他逢人必问 #
He asks every passer-by

1768
02:30:43,701 --> 02:30:45,669
# 亦曾欣喜 亦曾悲伤 #
Wanders with a smile...

1769
02:30:45,770 --> 02:30:47,704
# 他只身流浪 #
...and a tear

1770
02:30:47,805 --> 02:30:51,070
# 沿着街道漫无目的地流浪 #
Wanders aimless from street to street

1771
02:30:51,842 --> 02:30:53,366
# 处处为家 #
Belonging to all

1772
02:30:53,477 --> 02:30:55,445
我为米拉写了这首歌...
I wrote this song for Meera...

1773
02:30:55,880 --> 02:30:56,938
知道一切都是命中注定...
and see my fate...

1774
02:30:57,148 --> 02:30:58,172
就像今天这样的一个傍晚
it was an evening just like this,

1775
02:30:58,249 --> 02:31:00,444
我在唱歌...结果一睁开眼
I was singing... and when I opened my eyes

1776
02:31:00,551 --> 02:31:02,416
米拉就站在我眼前
Meera was standing in front of me

1777
02:31:03,054 --> 02:31:04,954
我声由心发 为她吟唱
For who my heart sung this song,

1778
02:31:05,589 --> 02:31:07,318
我的歌声令她怦然心动
it reached out and found her heart

1779
02:31:09,427 --> 02:31:11,987
这不是命中注定我爱你的爱情故事么?
Isn't it a made-for-each-other love story?

1780
02:31:12,163 --> 02:31:13,357
来吧 伙计们
Come on, guys

1781
02:31:13,864 --> 02:31:15,923
噢 兄弟 真高兴见到你
O, dude, cool good to see you

1782
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:17,092
给你一张钞票
A note for you

1783
02:31:19,170 --> 02:31:24,075
# 这癫狂的流浪汉在寻找着什么? #
What does this crazy wanderer seek?

1784
02:31:25,476 --> 02:31:30,004
# 这癫狂的流浪汉在寻找着什么? #
What does this crazy wanderer seek?

1785
02:31:33,284 --> 02:31:38,019
# 这癫狂的流浪汉在寻找着什么? #
What does this crazy wanderer seek?

1786
02:32:06,250 --> 02:32:08,514
今天 我去见了萨马・阿南德
Today I met Samar Anand,

1787
02:32:09,753 --> 02:32:12,483
他就像个陌生人
a man who I had never met before,

1788
02:32:13,924 --> 02:32:16,586
我认识的萨马好像只是... 鬼魂
the Samar that I know is like... a ghost,

1789
02:32:16,727 --> 02:32:17,785
一个影子
a shadow,

1790
02:32:18,129 --> 02:32:19,460
再也不存在了
that's not alive

1791
02:32:21,866 --> 02:32:24,300
萨马只为爱你而活
Samar lives only to love you,

1792
02:32:25,503 --> 02:32:28,404
没有你他活不下去
without you there's no breath in his life

1793
02:32:32,710 --> 02:32:33,540
你知道吗!
You know!

1794
02:32:34,245 --> 02:32:36,008
我一整天都在想
I was thinking the whole day

1795
02:32:36,147 --> 02:32:38,342
如果我们同时出现在他的生命中
that if we were in his life together the same time,

1796
02:32:38,516 --> 02:32:39,574
会怎么样
what would happen,

1797
02:32:40,084 --> 02:32:43,281
就算在我的梦里 你也是遥遥领先
and even in my dreams, I was miles behind you

1798
02:32:46,423 --> 02:32:47,947
你不了解我
You don't know me,

1799
02:32:48,592 --> 02:32:51,527
我一直傲视群芳
I've been a topper all my life,

1800
02:32:52,963 --> 02:32:55,431
荣誉学生 每项运动都拿金牌...
an honour student, a gold medalist in every sport...

1801
02:32:56,534 --> 02:32:58,593
我每三个月就甩个男朋友
I dump my boyfriends every three months,

1802
02:32:58,669 --> 02:33:00,728
不会给他们甩掉我的机会
before they leave me,

1803
02:33:02,072 --> 02:33:04,006
因为我无法接受拒绝
because I can't handle rejection

1804
02:33:07,144 --> 02:33:11,581
所以在萨马恢复前 跟我大谈友情之前
So now before Samar recovers and lectures me on friendship and all,

1805
02:33:12,183 --> 02:33:14,413
我主动放弃这段感情...
I am getting out of this love...

1806
02:33:15,252 --> 02:33:18,813
虽然要花点时间 但是我会恢复的
it'll take time but then I'll be okay,

1807
02:33:21,859 --> 02:33:24,726
所以我来告诉你
So I've come to tell you that,

1808
02:33:25,229 --> 02:33:27,754
如果你是因为我而却步
if it's because of me that you're stopping yourself,

1809
02:33:28,265 --> 02:33:29,493
那你真的在浪费时间
then you're wasting time,

1810
02:33:31,101 --> 02:33:33,763
因为我从来就没有在萨马的爱情故事里存在过
because I've never existed in Samar's love story

1811
02:33:35,139 --> 02:33:39,633
他的爱情故事里一直都有米拉 也只有米拉
His love story's always had Meera and will only have Meera in it

1812
02:33:45,049 --> 02:33:47,745
我不是因为你才迟迟没有行动的 亚基拉
I wasn't stopping myself because of you, Akira

1813
02:33:48,886 --> 02:33:51,218
是因为萨马
It is because of Samar I'm stopping myself

1814
02:33:52,756 --> 02:33:57,250
每天我都想打破我的承诺跟他在一起
Everyday I want to break my promise and fall into his arms,

1815
02:33:58,262 --> 02:34:00,924
但是如果他出事了怎么办?
but what if something happens to him?

1816
02:34:02,633 --> 02:34:05,796
我是因为害怕 才一直克制自己
It is this if that scares me and why I stop myself

1817
02:34:09,006 --> 02:34:11,736
每天我都为他祈祷
Everyday I pray for his life

1818
02:34:13,644 --> 02:34:15,874
一天天坐等年华老去
and every day I die a little

1819
02:34:19,450 --> 02:34:23,011
现在说这个...上帝 祈祷 承诺啥的
Now this... God, prayers, promises and all,

1820
02:34:23,220 --> 02:34:25,245
我不懂...
I don't understand...

1821
02:34:25,489 --> 02:34:27,480
我很少祈祷...
I really don't pray much...

1822
02:34:28,959 --> 02:34:31,621
但是我走之前想告诉你...
but before going there's one tip I'm giving you...

1823
02:34:33,697 --> 02:34:37,098
你是为了让他活着所以离开他
You left him so that he stays alive,

1824
02:34:38,302 --> 02:34:40,531
可是如果你不跟他在一起 
but now if you're not with him 

1825
02:34:40,532 --> 02:34:42,204
他和死了没什么分别
he is as good as dead

1826
02:34:43,440 --> 02:34:45,840
也许你的上帝是想告诉你
maybe your God's trying to tell you,

1827
02:34:46,143 --> 02:34:48,634
嘿 米拉 够了
Hey Meera, enough is enough,

1828
02:34:49,246 --> 02:34:52,079
现在去为你自己而活吧
now go and live a little

1829
02:34:57,388 --> 02:34:58,650
再见
See you

1830
02:35:18,642 --> 02:35:19,472
喂 扎因
Ya, Zain

1831
02:35:19,543 --> 02:35:20,874
萨马 我们新餐厅的地址
Samar, our new restaurant's site

1832
02:35:20,978 --> 02:35:22,741
在大理石拱门地铁站前面 知道么?
is in front of Marble Arch Station, okay?

1833
02:35:22,846 --> 02:35:25,906
好的 你先去 我搭火车去
Okay, you get there, I'll catch the train and come

1834
02:35:26,016 --> 02:35:27,244
好的 快点
Okay come quick

1835
02:35:31,922 --> 02:35:35,119
女士们 先生们 紧急疏散 这边走
Ladies and gents we need to evacuate this station come this way,

1836
02:35:35,225 --> 02:35:37,921
大家这边走 快点
Everybody come on this way start moving up this way

1837
02:35:38,929 --> 02:35:41,796
大家这边走 通报中说车上有炸弹
Everybody up this way - Due to a reported bomb aboard the train,

1838
02:35:42,166 --> 02:35:45,431
各位乘客请马上出站
all passengers are requested to leave the station immediately,

1839
02:35:45,502 --> 02:35:47,402
请各位乘客从身边最近的出口撤离
by the nearest available exit

1840
02:35:47,705 --> 02:35:50,572
请遵照安保人员的指示
Please obey the instructions of the security personnel

1841
02:36:12,162 --> 02:36:15,131
通报中表示发现炸弹... 炸弹...
Due to a reported bomb... bomb... bomb

1842
02:36:33,050 --> 02:36:34,517
三分钟 再重复一遍
Three minutes copy

1843
02:36:34,852 --> 02:36:35,910
先生你不能呆在这里
Mister you can't be here,

1844
02:36:36,019 --> 02:36:38,249
车上有炸弹 请你马上离开
there's a bomb on board you need to evacuate now

1845
02:36:40,391 --> 02:36:42,086
十磅塞姆汀塑胶炸药
Ten pounds symtex,

1846
02:36:43,127 --> 02:36:44,958
可能还附有榴霰弹
possibly with shrapnel,

1847
02:36:46,096 --> 02:36:47,859
不是动敏式的
not motion sensitive,

1848
02:36:48,499 --> 02:36:49,693
远程遥控
remote detonator

1849
02:36:51,101 --> 02:36:52,261
查理...
Charlie...

1850
02:36:54,204 --> 02:36:56,695
他也许是个内行 让他过来
This guy might just know what he's talking about, let him through

1851
02:38:07,044 --> 02:38:09,274
我是唐古・维克托 191号控制点
Tango Victor, 191 control

1852
02:38:09,379 --> 02:38:10,937
排爆工作已完成
The bomb has now been defused,

1853
02:38:11,048 --> 02:38:14,176
重复 排爆工作已完成
I repeat the bomb has now been defused

1854
02:38:15,219 --> 02:38:16,243
真是太感谢你了
Thank you so much

1855
02:38:16,353 --> 02:38:17,615
先生 请问您尊姓大名?
What's your name Sir?

1856
02:38:19,156 --> 02:38:21,056
我是萨马・阿南德少校!
I'm Major Samar Anand!

1857
02:38:22,826 --> 02:38:23,952
印度军人!
Indian Army!

1858
02:38:24,828 --> 02:38:26,352
拆弹小组
Bomb Disposal Squad

1859
02:39:20,517 --> 02:39:21,711
萨马
Samar,

1860
02:39:27,124 --> 02:39:28,751
你在这儿干什么?
what are you doing?

1861
02:39:29,893 --> 02:39:33,420
为什么把我叫到这儿来?
Why have you called me here?

1862
02:39:50,681 --> 02:39:52,945
在我失去的众多记忆中
For all the moments that I have lost in the past,

1863
02:39:53,617 --> 02:39:56,450
今天我找回了这样一幕
today I have come to steal back one moment,

1864
02:39:57,154 --> 02:40:01,557
今天我将再一次 再娶你一次
today I'm going to,once again, marry you

1865
02:40:09,433 --> 02:40:11,298
你愿意嫁给我吗 米拉?
Will you marry me, Meera?

1866
02:40:13,570 --> 02:40:16,232
萨马 别这样 我们不能就这样结婚
Stop it, Samar,we can't just get married like this

1867
02:40:16,340 --> 02:40:18,672
为什么 为什么不能?
Why, why can't we?

1868
02:40:19,076 --> 02:40:20,805
你曾说我们就应该这样结婚
You'd said this is how we got married,

1869
02:40:20,877 --> 02:40:23,744
不需要婚礼 只有你我...
no celebrations, just you and me...

1870
02:40:24,348 --> 02:40:27,010
那么让我们重来一次... 为了我
So let's just do it again... for me

1871
02:40:27,751 --> 02:40:30,413
来吧 我先开始
Come on, I'll start

1872
02:40:31,154 --> 02:40:34,612
对不起 我不记得上次我说了什么
I'm sorry, what I said last time or how

1873
02:40:34,725 --> 02:40:36,317
也不记得是怎样说的
I don't remember,

1874
02:40:36,727 --> 02:40:39,821
但是这一次我只想说 我非常爱米拉
but all I will say this time is that I love Meera a lot

1875
02:40:41,031 --> 02:40:43,295
并且我保证我将会永远
and I promise that I will forever

1876
02:40:43,367 --> 02:40:44,857
不要说了 萨马
Stop it, Samar

1877
02:40:46,203 --> 02:40:47,693
这可不是玩笑!
This is not a joke!

1878
02:40:49,873 --> 02:40:51,363
哇 真是想不到
Wow, this is amazing,

1879
02:40:52,342 --> 02:40:54,572
你不仅把我们的婚姻当做玩笑 还欺骗了我
you've made our marriage a joke and lied about it

1880
02:40:56,513 --> 02:40:59,073
我就不能来个小小的恶作剧?
and I can't even play a small little prank?

1881
02:41:12,129 --> 02:41:14,324
记忆真是有意思...
Memory is such a funny thing...

1882
02:41:15,132 --> 02:41:18,033
我们用一生尝试着忘掉一些事情
we spend a whole lifetime trying to forget something

1883
02:41:18,201 --> 02:41:19,463
却忘不掉
but we can't

1884
02:41:19,870 --> 02:41:22,134
我们想记住的某些小小片段
and then if we try to remember some thing small

1885
02:41:22,205 --> 02:41:23,672
却怎么也记不住
we're unable to

1886
02:41:24,675 --> 02:41:25,869
你知道吗 米拉
You know, Meera,

1887
02:41:26,076 --> 02:41:28,067
在军队里的每一天我都会想
everyday in the army I used to think,

1888
02:41:28,545 --> 02:41:30,570
为什么上帝会让我活下来?
why is it that He keeps me alive?

1889
02:41:31,081 --> 02:41:33,072
今天我明白了...
Today I figured that out...

1890
02:41:33,617 --> 02:41:36,586
他对自己加诸于我身上的一切还不是很满意
He wasn't fully satisfied with what He had done to me

1891
02:41:37,287 --> 02:41:39,653
他先将我从你的生命中赶走
He first tears me away from your life,

1892
02:41:39,756 --> 02:41:42,316
他说走吧 去过那种没有她陪伴的生活
He says go... go live without her

1893
02:41:42,993 --> 02:41:44,620
所以每一天...
So I go and everyday...

1894
02:41:44,728 --> 02:41:48,186
我都徘徊在死亡的臂弯里 试图打败上帝
I live in the arms of death, hoping to defeat God

1895
02:41:48,632 --> 02:41:50,998
但是他就没输过
But out there also He kept winning,

1896
02:41:51,268 --> 02:41:53,532
他没让我死
He didn't let me die...

1897
02:41:54,971 --> 02:41:56,836
然后有一天 奇迹般的 
and then one day, like magic,

1898
02:41:56,837 --> 02:41:58,702
他把你送回了我的生命中
He brings you back into my life,

1899
02:41:58,809 --> 02:42:00,572
接着送回了我失去的记忆
He brings back all my lost memories,

1900
02:42:00,677 --> 02:42:01,666
他让我再次飞翔起来
He makes me fly again

1901
02:42:01,745 --> 02:42:05,681
接着又出其不意地狠狠将我摔回地上
and then in a flash He slams me back onto the ground

1902
02:42:08,185 --> 02:42:10,779
他将我从梦中唤醒 就想告诉我
He wakes me up from my dreams and tells me,

1903
02:42:10,887 --> 02:42:15,324
你的生活不过如此了
your life is exactly how it is,

1904
02:42:16,493 --> 02:42:20,361
米拉 仍然是我的 你休想得到她
Meera is still Mine,she will never be yours,

1905
02:42:20,831 --> 02:42:22,799
因为直到今天
because even till today,

1906
02:42:23,133 --> 02:42:24,430
她向我许下的承诺
the promise she made to me,

1907
02:42:24,501 --> 02:42:26,833
比她向你许下的承诺要珍贵得多
is greater than the promise she made to you,

1908
02:42:27,704 --> 02:42:30,696
这么简单的事实你怎么就不明白呢
there's this simple little thing you don't seem to understand,

1909
02:42:32,809 --> 02:42:37,246
她爱我胜过于爱你
more than you, she's in love with me

1910
02:42:41,084 --> 02:42:43,780
如果你是为了另一个人而离开我
If you'd at least left me for another person,

1911
02:42:43,887 --> 02:42:46,412
我可怜他 也能原谅他
I would've felt pity and forgiven him

1912
02:42:47,290 --> 02:42:51,283
但是... 我该怎样可怜上帝?
But... how do I feel pity for God?

1913
02:42:55,165 --> 02:42:56,189
我要回去了
I'm going back,

1914
02:42:58,935 --> 02:43:01,165
十年来 我都习惯没有你的生活了
I spent 10 years without you

1915
02:43:01,838 --> 02:43:03,635
每天怀着对你的爱恋
By loving you every single day,

1916
02:43:03,707 --> 02:43:05,174
我再独自生活一百年都不是问题
I can live for another 100 years

1917
02:43:05,242 --> 02:43:09,576
要么... 要么上帝就杀了我
Either... either He kills me,

1918
02:43:12,082 --> 02:43:17,045
要么他就接受失败 将你送到我身边
or then accepts defeat and sends you to me

1919
02:43:20,290 --> 02:43:21,655
萨马...
Samar...

1920
02:43:43,046 --> 02:43:44,513
你的护照 飞机票...
Your passport, ticket...

1921
02:43:44,581 --> 02:43:46,048
入境登记表 我会帮你填的...
immigration form,I'll fill it for you...

1922
02:43:46,116 --> 02:43:47,913
入境登记处在那儿...
but the immigration is there...

1923
02:43:48,618 --> 02:43:51,416
我现在已经恢复记忆了 记得吗?
My memory is back now, remember?

1924
02:43:52,956 --> 02:43:55,584
我希望能将你从我的记忆里删除
I wish I could delete you from my memory

1925
02:43:56,927 --> 02:44:00,090
我曾是那么没心没肺的一个人
I was such a heartless carefree bitch

1926
02:44:00,797 --> 02:44:03,493
看现在你把我变成了什么样子
and now see what you've made me

1927
02:44:06,736 --> 02:44:08,169
亚基拉 问题是
Akira, the thing is,

1928
02:44:09,472 --> 02:44:11,531
上帝和我相处的不是很好
God and me don't get along too well,

1929
02:44:12,509 --> 02:44:13,917
但是我相信看到人之将死 
but while dying 

1930
02:44:13,918 --> 02:44:15,444
他甚至会听从我这个敌人的话
I believe He listens even to His enemies,

1931
02:44:15,879 --> 02:44:17,676
所以时机来临时
so when my time comes,

1932
02:44:18,281 --> 02:44:20,442
我会向他祈求来生
I'll ask Him for another life,

1933
02:44:22,319 --> 02:44:24,116
用下辈子去爱你!
to love you!

1934
02:44:26,756 --> 02:44:29,919
此生我生错年代了
This time around I was born in the wrong generation,

1935
02:44:30,126 --> 02:44:33,960
有一点过时了 不是吗?
I became a bit old fashioned, no?

1936
02:44:35,398 --> 02:44:37,127
但是我保证来生
But I promise next time

1937
02:44:37,801 --> 02:44:40,497
会成为像你一样的时髦恋人
I'll come as a modern lover like you,

1938
02:44:41,071 --> 02:44:43,631
我们会是英伦爱情故事里圆满的一对
and ours will be a full on English style love story

1939
02:44:43,907 --> 02:44:45,340
好极了 兵哥
Very good soldier,

1940
02:44:46,209 --> 02:44:48,098
你将我改造成了一个浪漫的人 
you've made me into a complete romantic 

1941
02:44:48,099 --> 02:44:49,178
你也越来越时髦了
and you're turning modern

1942
02:44:49,779 --> 02:44:51,644
如果你还会回来 就像现在这样回来
If you want to come, come back exactly like this,

1943
02:44:51,915 --> 02:44:53,644
从头到脚一模一样
from head to toe,

1944
02:44:54,217 --> 02:44:56,879
亚基拉怎么轮回都不会缺男朋友的
Akira will never have a shortage of boyfriends in any life

1945
02:44:58,722 --> 02:45:00,417
不要变成我这样...
Don't become like me...

1946
02:45:04,928 --> 02:45:06,759
太晚了 兵哥
Too late soldier

1947
02:45:08,131 --> 02:45:09,189
太晚了
Too late

1948
02:45:48,738 --> 02:45:51,730
待我给出解除警报的信号后再通告其他车辆
Inform the other vehicles only after I give the All Clear signal

1949
02:45:52,542 --> 02:45:54,237
好了 完毕
Alright. Over and out

1950
02:46:52,836 --> 02:46:53,564
安全了
We are safe

1951
02:46:53,837 --> 02:46:54,633
好的 长官
Okay, sir

1952
02:46:55,405 --> 02:46:56,463
- 克里斯南   - 到 长官
- Krishnan - Yes, sir

1953
02:46:56,706 --> 02:46:57,900
和以前一样...
Same again...

1954
02:46:58,441 --> 02:46:59,567
这些天都很平淡啊
Everything's become so common these days

1955
02:47:00,010 --> 02:47:01,841
我建议...你去支援大桥
I suggest...that you support the bridge

1956
02:47:01,911 --> 02:47:02,605
好的 长官
Okay, sir

1957
02:47:39,282 --> 02:47:41,546
今天是我的死期吗?
Am I going to die today?

1958
02:47:43,353 --> 02:47:46,447
萨马 这十年你并非独自承受苦痛
You didn't bear these 10 years all by yourself, Samar,

1959
02:47:47,690 --> 02:47:50,420
我同你一样 每天都是坐待年华老去...
I've been dying everyday along with you...

1960
02:47:53,363 --> 02:47:56,628
我用了十年才想明白这个简单的事
it's taken me 10 years to understand a simple thing,

1961
02:47:59,736 --> 02:48:02,705
并不是只有我离开你 上帝才容许你活下去
that He didn't keep you alive to be without me,

1962
02:48:05,742 --> 02:48:07,733
他让你活着 是让你和我在一起
He kept you alive to be with me

1963
02:48:11,047 --> 02:48:13,607
你怎么不早一点明白...
Couldn't you have understood this a little sooner...

1964
02:48:14,451 --> 02:48:15,713
早一点就好了
just a little

1965
02:48:20,290 --> 02:48:22,451
你一开始就知道的
You knew this from the beginning,

1966
02:48:22,826 --> 02:48:27,195
我得多花一点的时间才能想明白
that I take a little more time to understand things,

1967
02:48:28,765 --> 02:48:32,496
有人告诉我
and someone had told me

1968
02:48:33,536 --> 02:48:36,164
每段爱都有它的时机 
that every love has it's time,

1969
02:48:37,407 --> 02:48:39,432
当时时机还不成熟
that time, was not ours,

1970
02:48:42,112 --> 02:48:44,012
但是现在 时机刚刚好
but this, is our time

1971
02:48:45,148 --> 02:48:48,311
长官 我们发现了另一枚炸弹
Sir we've located another LED

1972
02:48:52,622 --> 02:48:54,351
再等一会儿
Wait for some more time,

1973
02:48:55,658 --> 02:48:58,149
我把工作处理好就回来
I'll finish a bit of work and come back

1974
02:49:00,363 --> 02:49:01,489
听着!
And listen!

1975
02:49:02,499 --> 02:49:04,160
用不着祈祷
Don't pray for anything

1976
02:49:04,968 --> 02:49:06,492
爱我就足够了...
just love me...

1977
02:49:07,537 --> 02:49:09,164
炸弹也好 上帝也罢
because there's no bomb,

1978
02:49:09,506 --> 02:49:12,873
没啥能阻止我回到你身边
or God, that can keep me from coming back to you

1979
02:49:14,410 --> 02:49:15,843
我知道
I know

1980
02:49:22,385 --> 02:49:26,287
萨马・阿南德 "不死传奇"!
Samar Anand, The Man Who Cannot Die!

1981
02:49:26,856 --> 02:49:30,917
他拆过一百零七枚炸弹 毫发无伤
He has defused 107 bombs without a scratch on his body

1982
02:49:31,294 --> 02:49:32,941
我们说话的这会儿 
He's right now as we speak 

1983
02:49:32,942 --> 02:49:35,321
他正在拆除第一百零八枚炸弹
defusing his 108th

1984
02:49:35,798 --> 02:49:37,891
这不是一个有关勇气的故事
This is not a story of courage,

1985
02:49:38,334 --> 02:49:40,666
这不是一个有关... 奇迹的故事
its not a story of... miracles!

1986
02:49:41,538 --> 02:49:44,701
这只是一个简单的关于爱的故事
Its just a simple story of love,

1987
02:49:45,775 --> 02:49:48,608
男人付诸女人的永不磨灭的爱
undying love that a man had for a woman,

1988
02:49:49,212 --> 02:49:52,443
女人付诸男人的无畏无惧的爱
unflinching love that a woman had for a man,

1989
02:49:52,949 --> 02:49:56,476
还有上帝必将眷顾他们的无穷信仰
and unending faith that God had on their love

1990
02:49:57,754 --> 02:49:59,585
接触这个故事之前 我想着
I got into this story thinking

1991
02:49:59,656 --> 02:50:02,181
这是我入职搜索频道的敲门砖
that this was my big ticket to Discovery channel,

1992
02:50:02,659 --> 02:50:04,524
我以为我会倾向于讲述一个关于勇气
I'm going to discover a story of courage,

1993
02:50:05,094 --> 02:50:08,086
胆量 危险 或者奇迹的故事
bravery, danger, miracles

1994
02:50:09,699 --> 02:50:11,667
但是最后 我选择了爱
But I ended up discovering love

1995
02:50:12,535 --> 02:50:14,366
这种爱让你们两地分散
Love that breaks you,

1996
02:50:14,571 --> 02:50:16,300
却心意相牵
but still keeps you together,

1997
02:50:17,106 --> 02:50:18,903
这种爱让你们天涯海角
Love that creates distances,

1998
02:50:19,576 --> 02:50:21,544
却近在咫尺
but still brings you closer,

1999
02:50:22,579 --> 02:50:24,171
真实的
Love that is true,

2000
02:50:24,747 --> 02:50:26,078
永远的爱...
and forever...

2001
02:50:26,449 --> 02:50:27,916
我还发现
and I learnt that,

2002
02:50:28,151 --> 02:50:30,483
如果你有能力这样去爱一个人
if you have the power to love like that,

2003
02:50:30,720 --> 02:50:33,951
上帝定会成全你 让你情有所属
then God makes sure that your love finds its way

2004
02:50:34,591 --> 02:50:37,822
你要做的 就是坚持住
All you have to do is just hang in there

2005
02:50:38,428 --> 02:50:39,622
耐心地等待...
and wait...

2006
02:50:40,196 --> 02:50:41,663
等待你们的时机
wait for your time

2007
02:50:43,366 --> 02:50:44,560
就在我说话的这会儿
As we speak right now

2008
02:50:45,301 --> 02:50:48,293
萨马正在拆除他的第一百零八枚炸弹
Samar is defusing his 108th bomb,

2009
02:50:49,138 --> 02:50:50,503
最后一枚
his last one,

2010
02:50:51,274 --> 02:50:54,107
这当然不是因为他突然开始畏惧死亡
its his last not because he's suddenly scared of dying,

2011
02:50:54,444 --> 02:50:55,706
之所以是最后一枚
it's his last,

2012
02:50:55,945 --> 02:50:58,106
是因为现在是时候开始他的新生活了
because it's his time to live now,

2013
02:50:58,715 --> 02:51:01,309
他的等待终于功德圆满了...
his wait is finally over...

2014
02:51:01,918 --> 02:51:03,909
属于他的时机已经到来
his time has come...

2015
02:51:04,654 --> 02:51:06,519
成全自己的爱的时机!
his time to love!

2016
02:51:12,662 --> 02:51:14,687
你愿意嫁给我吗?
Will you marry me?

2017
02:51:15,498 --> 02:51:16,590
我愿意...
Yes...

2018
02:51:50,133 --> 02:51:52,328
这不是一个有关于勇气的故事!
This is not a story of courage!

2019
02:51:52,502 --> 02:51:54,868
不是一个有关于奇迹的故事!
It's not a story of miracles!

2020
02:51:55,238 --> 02:52:00,099
这只是一个简单的关于爱的故事!
It's just a simple story of love!
