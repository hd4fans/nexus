1
00:01:03,628 --> 00:01:05,300
Dad, what's happening?

2
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,923
Nick, listen to me,

3
00:01:07,928 --> 00:01:09,413
like we're the last 2 people on the planet.

4
00:01:09,418 --> 00:01:10,300
Okay? Nick,

5
00:01:11,106 --> 00:01:14,406
Some day a girl is gonna give you a flower.

6
00:01:15,377 --> 00:01:16,842
You got that? A flower.

7
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,500
And you have to help her.

8
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,400
You help her and you help us all.

9
00:01:20,885 --> 00:01:22,476
Okay?

10
00:01:24,115 --> 00:01:26,310
I know it doesn't make any sense right now,

11
00:01:26,418 --> 00:01:28,545
but I believe the woman who told me that.

12
00:01:29,254 --> 00:01:30,983
You think you could believe me?

13
00:01:32,991 --> 00:01:34,549
I love you.

14
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,221
I always said you were special, Nick.

15
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:42,823
Turns out I was right.

16
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,740
Division's here. Nick. Just keep moving.

17
00:01:54,813 --> 00:01:57,543
And don't make any decisions that any watcher can track.

18
00:02:41,593 --> 00:02:43,561
I just wanted to have a conversation.

19
00:03:05,884 --> 00:03:07,374
What a waste.

20
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,647
Bring his body to the lab.

21
00:03:16,928 --> 00:03:18,987
There are special people in this world.

22
00:03:19,698 --> 00:03:21,529
We don't ask to be special.

23
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:23,796
We're just born this way.

24
00:03:28,306 --> 00:03:30,706
We pass you on the streets every day,

25
00:03:31,643 --> 00:03:33,474
unnoticed by most.

26
00:03:43,021 --> 00:03:45,046
It started in 1945.

27
00:03:45,724 --> 00:03:48,989
The Nazis were conducting experiments in psychic warfare...

28
00:03:49,728 --> 00:03:53,255
trying to turn those with psychic abilities into soldiers.

29
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,823
Lots of us died.

30
00:03:56,935 --> 00:03:58,163
The war ended,

31
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,438
but the experiments never stopped.

32
00:04:01,106 --> 00:04:02,767
Other governments around the world

33
00:04:02,907 --> 00:04:05,171
set up what they called "Divisions"...

34
00:04:08,413 --> 00:04:10,711
trying to do what the Nazis couldn't,

35
00:04:10,815 --> 00:04:12,407
to turn us into weapons.

36
00:04:12,617 --> 00:04:16,747
Division's agents are trained to track and hunt us down like animals...

37
00:04:16,855 --> 00:04:19,187
take us away from our families and friends.

38
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,821
There are children stuffed away all over the world.

39
00:04:23,061 --> 00:04:25,461
They test us and categorize us.

40
00:04:25,764 --> 00:04:27,595
I'm what they call a "watcher".

41
00:04:27,732 --> 00:04:28,994
We can see the future,

42
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:31,149
even if that's not always as simple as it sounds.

43
00:04:31,154 --> 00:04:35,021
The jumbo jet crashed. There are no reports of survivors.

44
00:04:35,206 --> 00:04:36,696
Others are called "movers",

45
00:04:37,075 --> 00:04:39,202
just an easy way of saying "telekinetic".

46
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,349
"Pushers" put thoughts in your head

47
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:48,783
and make whatever lie they come up with the truth.

48
00:04:48,887 --> 00:04:51,378
They'd already begun to control my mind...

49
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:58,993
"Sniffs", "shifters", "shadows",

50
00:04:59,063 --> 00:05:01,531
"bleeders", it goes on and on.

51
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:05,167
In Division's eyes, we're all just lab rats.

52
00:05:06,337 --> 00:05:09,773
Only one problem: we keep dying.

53
00:05:09,874 --> 00:05:13,935
The evidence shows that the kids were given milk with radioactive iodine.

54
00:05:14,012 --> 00:05:17,277
No one has ever survived the drug meant to boost our powers.

55
00:05:17,715 --> 00:05:19,148
My name is Cassie Holmes.

56
00:05:19,784 --> 00:05:21,376
Division took my mom from me.

57
00:05:21,653 --> 00:05:24,417
Right now the future I see doesn't look so great.

58
00:05:24,489 --> 00:05:27,481
The good news is the future is always changing...

59
00:05:27,826 --> 00:05:31,523
in the largest of ways by the smallest of things.

60
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,261
They've been winning a lot of battles.

61
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:37,133
Now it's our turn to win the war.

62
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,498



" PRESENT DAY "

63
00:05:43,966 --> 00:05:46,478



" DIVISION LAB "

64
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,494
She survived the injection.

65
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:22,164
She's our patient zero. Bring me every sniffer we have.

66
00:07:22,273 --> 00:07:24,366
But she's on foot. She can't get far.

67
00:07:26,377 --> 00:07:28,902
She'll get help from anyone she can lay her eyes on.

68
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:35,040
Do whatever is necessary to get her and that syringe back!

69
00:07:35,045 --> 00:07:35,944
 Now!!

70
00:07:39,457 --> 00:07:42,334



" 2 DAYS FROM NOW "

71
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,680
- Good morning.      - Good morning.

72
00:09:16,184 --> 00:09:18,584
You-- You are lucky.

73
00:09:21,993 --> 00:09:24,584
You still want to play? You've lost 5 grand now...

74
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:27,210
Chan said you still haven't paid him off your debt, huh?

75
00:09:28,215 --> 00:09:29,557
He lied...

76
00:09:29,634 --> 00:09:32,501
He lied? Are you suggesting I'm lying?

77
00:09:32,603 --> 00:09:34,434
You already got 15 grand of debts, do the math.

78
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:36,734
You want to bet or not?

79
00:09:37,442 --> 00:09:39,376
How arrogant-- Okay!

80
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,943
If he loses again, we gonna fix him up with punches.

81
00:09:40,988 --> 00:09:41,788
Hurry up!

82
00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:44,186
If you lose, we gonna have to beat you up this time.

83
00:09:44,187 --> 00:09:45,687
Watch your step.

84
00:10:20,017 --> 00:10:23,145
You still owe me 5 grand!

85
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,887
What do you say, Nick?

86
00:11:02,627 --> 00:11:03,423
Who are you?

87
00:11:03,528 --> 00:11:05,462
- We're with Division.      - Like you didn't know.

88
00:11:06,631 --> 00:11:07,832
- Go to hell.      - Easy, son.

89
00:11:07,832 --> 00:11:09,800
If we wanted you, you'd be in the back of a van.

90
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:12,165
You gonna let us in or are we gonna have to be rude?

91
00:11:15,873 --> 00:11:18,068
Smart move living in a shithole like this.

92
00:11:18,743 --> 00:11:21,507
One on top of the other. Took you far off the radar.

93
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:22,807
Not far enough.

94
00:11:26,384 --> 00:11:27,976
Would you believe this is how we found you?

95
00:11:28,052 --> 00:11:31,021
From your old toothbrush from that encounter 10 years ago.

96
00:11:31,155 --> 00:11:32,452
Barely a scent left.

97
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:38,660
Thought you were in Tokyo.

98
00:11:41,432 --> 00:11:42,660
Then Malaysia.

99
00:11:51,876 --> 00:11:55,107
Finally we got a few readings on some buildings.

100
00:12:04,222 --> 00:12:08,352
There's a lot of runaway psychics in Hong Kong trying to disappear. Nick.

101
00:12:08,859 --> 00:12:11,828
People with no country, no loyalty...

102
00:12:11,929 --> 00:12:14,796
No desire to get involved in political bullshit.

103
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,900
Nobody but you in this apartment for a long time, Nick.

104
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:35,146
Why? You looking for someone besides me?

105
00:12:35,686 --> 00:12:36,581
A girl.

106
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,655
She has something belonging to us.

107
00:12:39,457 --> 00:12:40,981
Better than a hunch you know her.

108
00:12:43,828 --> 00:12:45,386
Obviously I don't.

109
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:52,067
In case we need to get hold of you again.

110
00:12:52,169 --> 00:12:54,831
I've got some old toilet paper you boys might like more.

111
00:12:55,406 --> 00:12:57,033
Don't bother running.

112
00:12:58,409 --> 00:12:59,899
We know where you are now.

113
00:13:09,053 --> 00:13:10,520
Shit.

114
00:13:36,013 --> 00:13:37,378
- Yeah?      - Hey, Nick.

115
00:13:37,715 --> 00:13:39,444
- Who is this?      - Open up, Nick.

116
00:13:40,084 --> 00:13:41,779
And put your gun down.

117
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:58,325
Put that thing away. Got you something.

118
00:14:00,104 --> 00:14:02,572
Where's the chicken? There it is.

119
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:07,803
Hey, whoa! Excuse me?

120
00:14:08,813 --> 00:14:10,178
Is this how you treat your guests?

121
00:14:10,247 --> 00:14:14,240
This is how I treat random strangers who barge into my apartment.

122
00:14:14,385 --> 00:14:16,546
Like the Division sniffers who were just here?

123
00:14:17,555 --> 00:14:18,544
Who are you?

124
00:14:19,523 --> 00:14:20,990
I'm Cassie.

125
00:14:22,226 --> 00:14:23,557
I'm here to help you.

126
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,195
Listen, Cassie...

127
00:14:27,264 --> 00:14:30,199
I'm sure your mom and dad are nervous about you right now, so why don't you...

128
00:14:30,935 --> 00:14:32,869
- You don't understand.      - You've got that right.

129
00:14:33,804 --> 00:14:36,170
This is about us finding 6 million dollars.

130
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,304
That's us.

131
00:14:42,146 --> 00:14:43,511
And that's our money.

132
00:14:45,983 --> 00:14:47,575
And that's my toothbrush.

133
00:14:48,152 --> 00:14:49,346
You're a watcher.

134
00:14:51,155 --> 00:14:53,385
So is there a place we can get something to eat besides chicken?

135
00:14:56,827 --> 00:14:57,987
I'm buying.

136
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:13,699
Lose a bet with your hairdresser?

137
00:15:14,445 --> 00:15:15,673
I like color.

138
00:15:58,923 --> 00:16:02,154
First things first. I know you're a second-generation mover.

139
00:16:02,226 --> 00:16:03,784
Is that what the kids are calling it these days?

140
00:16:03,861 --> 00:16:05,192
I'll let you know when I see one.

141
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:06,797
You don't really use your powers,

142
00:16:06,864 --> 00:16:08,627
which means you haven't practiced and you kind of suck at it.

143
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:10,189
- How am I doing so far?      - Go on.

144
00:16:10,267 --> 00:16:11,393
I'm a watcher.

145
00:16:12,303 --> 00:16:13,861
Second generation, like you.

146
00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:15,836
- Wow. That's.      - Complicated.

147
00:16:16,173 --> 00:16:18,164
Because the future can change just by talking about it.

148
00:16:18,275 --> 00:16:19,902
So I see glimpses and I draw in my book.

149
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,500
But I'm not really good at it.

150
00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:23,274
I'm kind of a crappy artist, but...

151
00:16:23,814 --> 00:16:25,338
I'm sure you already knew that.

152
00:16:27,485 --> 00:16:29,248
But I got the sniffs in your apartment, right?

153
00:16:29,553 --> 00:16:31,247
That's why I brought you a new toothbrush.

154
00:16:31,247 --> 00:16:34,131
- Chief. I want to eat shrimps.      - Okay.

155
00:16:35,025 --> 00:16:36,219
You speak Chinese?

156
00:16:36,494 --> 00:16:39,190
Cantonese. I'm surprised you didn't know that,

157
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,522
being a watcher.

158
00:16:40,664 --> 00:16:42,393
I get things wrong sometimes.

159
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:43,690
I know the feeling.

160
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,570
Are you worried about the thugs you owe money to?

161
00:16:49,573 --> 00:16:51,234
Don't. Thank you.

162
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,172
We'll be able to take care of it in a couple days.

163
00:16:54,778 --> 00:16:56,769
With your 6 million dollars.

164
00:16:57,848 --> 00:16:59,782
- Where's the money?      - It's on its way here.

165
00:17:00,818 --> 00:17:01,910
With a girl.

166
00:17:03,254 --> 00:17:04,243
Don't tell me.

167
00:17:04,388 --> 00:17:06,379
Same girl Division sniffs are looking for.

168
00:17:09,994 --> 00:17:11,427
It's Cassie, right?

169
00:17:12,263 --> 00:17:13,628
Enjoy your food.

170
00:17:14,532 --> 00:17:15,931
- That's it?      - That's it.

171
00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:18,660
Sorry. Some 12-year old that knew I needed a new toothbrush...

172
00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:20,498
isn't enough to get me involved with Division.

173
00:17:20,604 --> 00:17:21,901
Even if it's not a con.

174
00:17:23,807 --> 00:17:27,174
I'm 13. And I've been told I look at least 14.

175
00:17:27,311 --> 00:17:29,302
- Right.      - And this is not a con.

176
00:17:29,413 --> 00:17:31,881
This is a way for everyone to get something they want.

177
00:17:31,982 --> 00:17:33,540
I've actually used that line before.

178
00:17:33,817 --> 00:17:36,308
Fine. Don't believe me.

179
00:17:37,655 --> 00:17:39,589
- But you will help me.      - Really?

180
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,282
Because I'm getting a message.

181
00:17:41,425 --> 00:17:44,087
It's telling me "find somebody else".

182
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,025
If we don't find the case and that girl,

183
00:17:48,132 --> 00:17:49,929
really bad things happen, Nick.

184
00:17:52,036 --> 00:17:54,334
What? What's wrong?

185
00:17:58,876 --> 00:18:02,141
Shit. They're here in the market.

186
00:18:02,212 --> 00:18:03,338
Who?

187
00:18:04,181 --> 00:18:06,376
- Who?      - They're in the market! Come on!

188
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,781
- Division?      - Bleeders!

189
00:18:07,885 --> 00:18:09,011
We've got to get out of here!

190
00:18:23,567 --> 00:18:24,829
- How does this end?      - I have no idea.

191
00:18:24,935 --> 00:18:26,266
Where is the girl?

192
00:18:26,937 --> 00:18:28,962
My daughter has already seen you with her.

193
00:18:29,073 --> 00:18:30,472
Told you.

194
00:18:31,709 --> 00:18:34,337
I've told 3 people already today, I don't know this girl.

195
00:18:36,213 --> 00:18:39,239
Stupid child. I already saw how you die.

196
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,978
Then you know it's not here and it's not today.

197
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:50,351
Damn.

198
00:18:52,529 --> 00:18:53,996
Go, go!

199
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,107
Go, go!

200
00:19:13,851 --> 00:19:15,375
Go, go!

201
00:19:21,825 --> 00:19:23,383
- Nick!      - Come here! Come here!

202
00:19:30,768 --> 00:19:32,360
The big tanks... Go!

203
00:19:33,103 --> 00:19:34,661
- Quick!      - This way!

204
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,261
Stop!

205
00:20:02,366 --> 00:20:04,800
- Stop!      - Run, Cassie!

206
00:20:06,136 --> 00:20:07,330
Stop!

207
00:20:22,653 --> 00:20:23,847
Not like this.

208
00:20:24,221 --> 00:20:26,189
lf we kill him we lose the girl.

209
00:23:31,775 --> 00:23:33,504
I already know you're here.

210
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:43,782
You must be Cassie Holmes.

211
00:23:45,022 --> 00:23:46,990
- Who sent you?      - Your mother.

212
00:23:49,626 --> 00:23:51,594
A week before she was captured by Division,

213
00:23:51,828 --> 00:23:54,058
she told me to be at that fish market today.

214
00:23:55,832 --> 00:23:57,265
Stay away from him.

215
00:23:57,834 --> 00:23:59,199
If that's what you want.

216
00:23:59,269 --> 00:24:02,102
Just be sure to add his picture to the Wall of the Dead.

217
00:24:03,573 --> 00:24:04,631
You're a stitch.

218
00:24:04,741 --> 00:24:06,766
That should be obvious to a watcher.

219
00:24:07,577 --> 00:24:10,102
If you had even a modicum of your mother's talent...

220
00:24:10,213 --> 00:24:11,510
I've been dealing with a lot.

221
00:24:11,581 --> 00:24:14,448
Years ago your mother did me a favor.

222
00:24:14,551 --> 00:24:16,644
Now it would seem I need to pay off my debt.

223
00:24:36,807 --> 00:24:39,935
I hear they've got your mother buried deep inside Division.

224
00:24:42,746 --> 00:24:46,375
Have her so drugged up she can't even hold a spoon.

225
00:24:47,617 --> 00:24:50,609
I bet they suck the future right out of her.

226
00:25:25,956 --> 00:25:27,685
You help her and you help us all.

227
00:25:29,092 --> 00:25:30,218
A flower

228
00:25:48,045 --> 00:25:49,376
Is he okay?

229
00:26:25,215 --> 00:26:27,513
- You okay?      - Yeah.

230
00:26:32,022 --> 00:26:33,182
Wow.

231
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,621
That woman's got magic fingers.

232
00:26:45,335 --> 00:26:46,632
For you.

233
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,701
What is that?

234
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,129
It's a lotus.

235
00:27:12,229 --> 00:27:13,992
I heard what she said about your mother.

236
00:27:15,732 --> 00:27:17,097
You did?

237
00:27:21,104 --> 00:27:22,628
Division's got her.

238
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:26,703
They locked her up because she's the... greatest watcher they've ever seen.

239
00:27:27,777 --> 00:27:29,301
They're afraid of her.

240
00:27:29,646 --> 00:27:31,511
And they're afraid they can't control her.

241
00:27:33,183 --> 00:27:35,208
They killed my father for the same reason.

242
00:27:38,054 --> 00:27:39,544
But I guess you already knew that.

243
00:27:41,024 --> 00:27:43,788
I see the future, not the past.

244
00:27:45,595 --> 00:27:48,860
And right now our future isn't that great.

245
00:27:50,967 --> 00:27:52,229
That's new?

246
00:27:52,769 --> 00:27:54,566
Now the sniffs from your apartment

247
00:27:54,704 --> 00:27:56,365
are going to get the girl and the case.

248
00:27:57,974 --> 00:27:59,339
It's changed.

249
00:28:00,143 --> 00:28:02,270
I don't know why...

250
00:28:02,779 --> 00:28:05,270
something I did, a mistake I made...

251
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:09,746
Doesn't matter, it just has.

252
00:28:12,856 --> 00:28:15,188
My mother told me that case...

253
00:28:15,325 --> 00:28:18,624
is the key to bringing down Division and freeing her.

254
00:28:21,431 --> 00:28:23,729
There's no money in that case, is there?

255
00:28:27,938 --> 00:28:30,031
Unless I'm missing something,

256
00:28:31,141 --> 00:28:32,574
they don't have the case yet.

257
00:28:34,144 --> 00:28:35,805
It's still out there.

258
00:28:39,416 --> 00:28:41,008
If your mother's such a great fortune-teller,

259
00:28:41,151 --> 00:28:42,584
how did she get caught?

260
00:28:43,086 --> 00:28:45,213
I'm just going to have to ask her that myself.

261
00:28:46,523 --> 00:28:48,423
I haven't even gotten to the bad part yet.

262
00:28:52,329 --> 00:28:53,523
What is that?

263
00:28:54,531 --> 00:28:55,896
We die.

264
00:28:57,667 --> 00:28:59,225
Great.

265
00:29:24,828 --> 00:29:26,295
Hello, Kira.

266
00:29:31,234 --> 00:29:32,531
You have a plane to catch.

267
00:29:32,869 --> 00:29:34,666
Come on. You want to come with us.

268
00:29:48,818 --> 00:29:51,343
Christ. Get a load of that.

269
00:29:51,454 --> 00:29:55,982
She must use that 10 times a day. That's a keeper.

270
00:29:56,426 --> 00:29:58,951
You're not gonna have a lot of lipstick opportunities where you're going.

271
00:29:59,029 --> 00:30:00,291
You know what I mean?

272
00:30:04,034 --> 00:30:05,262
She's doing it again.

273
00:30:05,335 --> 00:30:07,929
- Get the hell out of my head!      - No! No!

274
00:30:08,872 --> 00:30:11,170
- What does she want?      - She's got to go to the bathroom.

275
00:30:11,508 --> 00:30:13,066
To throw up or something.

276
00:30:13,176 --> 00:30:15,371
Carver will kill us if anything happens to her.

277
00:30:29,726 --> 00:30:31,387
- Bathroom?      - This way.

278
00:30:33,496 --> 00:30:34,588
Come on.

279
00:30:38,635 --> 00:30:40,762
Coffee, black, with sugar.

280
00:30:54,984 --> 00:30:56,815
Alright. In you go.

281
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,497
You're a good man, Agent Mack.

282
00:31:14,104 --> 00:31:16,129
I bet you come from a good family.

283
00:31:18,074 --> 00:31:20,304
It must have been hard for you when he died.

284
00:31:21,177 --> 00:31:22,337
Who died?

285
00:31:23,413 --> 00:31:24,744
Your brother.

286
00:31:25,315 --> 00:31:27,715
- I don't have a brother, sweetheart.      - No, you do.

287
00:31:28,551 --> 00:31:30,416
I've got something that will make you feel better.

288
00:31:31,221 --> 00:31:33,553
And you loved him very much.

289
00:31:37,193 --> 00:31:38,990
But he was murdered.

290
00:31:39,129 --> 00:31:41,529
And you know who did it, don't you?

291
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:54,741
But he was murdered...

292
00:31:55,412 --> 00:31:57,676
And you know who did it, don't you?

293
00:32:01,584 --> 00:32:05,111
You know who did it, don't you? But he was murdered...

294
00:32:19,636 --> 00:32:23,470
You know who did it he was murdered...

295
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:28,397
Lame.

296
00:34:29,332 --> 00:34:31,630
We've got to work on your skills if we're going to change anything.

297
00:34:31,701 --> 00:34:33,191
Don't bite your nails.

298
00:34:36,372 --> 00:34:38,363
The lollipop chick freaks me out.

299
00:34:40,209 --> 00:34:42,268
- She's a watcher.      - Like you.

300
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:44,305
Yeah.

301
00:34:45,348 --> 00:34:47,942
I know this place. This is...

302
00:34:48,985 --> 00:34:52,580
I know this place. Club B, boss. Science Museum Road.

303
00:34:53,323 --> 00:34:54,585
Thank you.

304
00:34:56,259 --> 00:34:57,851
Why is that olive out of the glass?

305
00:34:59,028 --> 00:35:02,191
- That's not an olive. It's a bead.      - It's a bead?

306
00:35:02,832 --> 00:35:06,063
Yeah, it's a bead. A shimmery kind of thing...

307
00:35:06,169 --> 00:35:08,637
Well, it looks like a pimento. If I was going to draw a bead, I'd...

308
00:35:08,738 --> 00:35:10,672
It's a bead with a shimmer.

309
00:35:11,374 --> 00:35:12,898
What does the bead have to do with it?

310
00:35:13,009 --> 00:35:15,569
I don't know what the shiny, shimmery bead has to do with it.

311
00:35:16,112 --> 00:35:17,272
Great.

312
00:35:18,147 --> 00:35:19,478
Let's keep it simple.

313
00:35:19,816 --> 00:35:21,807
We'll start with the bead and see where it takes us.

314
00:35:21,884 --> 00:35:25,320
Sounds like a plan, but... what about the part where we die?

315
00:35:40,536 --> 00:35:42,163
I remember growing up together.

316
00:35:42,572 --> 00:35:44,369
Where we went to school.

317
00:35:45,308 --> 00:35:46,605
How he died.

318
00:35:48,378 --> 00:35:50,369
So except for this brother you never had...

319
00:35:51,347 --> 00:35:53,838
is there anything else she might have put in your head?

320
00:35:54,283 --> 00:35:56,410
I'm only asking because I don't want to be shot in the face...

321
00:35:56,552 --> 00:35:59,043
for screwing some made up sister you don't really have.

322
00:36:00,423 --> 00:36:01,788
I don't have a sister?

323
00:36:08,831 --> 00:36:11,595
Agent Mack, you are relieved of duty.

324
00:36:11,701 --> 00:36:13,566
Get on a plane, eat some peanuts, and go home.

325
00:36:13,703 --> 00:36:15,034
She won't push me again, sir.

326
00:36:15,104 --> 00:36:16,503
She just caught me off-guard.

327
00:36:16,572 --> 00:36:19,132
The only thoughts in my head are my own.

328
00:36:20,443 --> 00:36:22,411
You're willing to risk your life on that?

329
00:36:23,413 --> 00:36:24,471
Yes, sir.

330
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:27,708
Then put the gun in your mouth and pull the trigger.

331
00:36:31,621 --> 00:36:32,952
Don't worry.

332
00:36:33,289 --> 00:36:36,053
You already checked it. It's not loaded.

333
00:36:44,133 --> 00:36:47,125
Spread these beads to any sniff, any watcher,

334
00:36:47,203 --> 00:36:49,405
any goddamn expatriate reader in Hong Kong

335
00:36:49,405 --> 00:36:52,704
who knows up from down until we find Kira.

336
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,775
What about the Chinese government and their guys?

337
00:36:56,245 --> 00:36:59,271
The story is out, bleeders all over the country will be looking for her.

338
00:36:59,716 --> 00:37:01,149
We can't let them get the drug.

339
00:37:01,551 --> 00:37:03,382
Then we put a price on her head.

340
00:37:10,993 --> 00:37:12,290
Yeah, this is it.

341
00:37:12,929 --> 00:37:15,796
Hey, can you... I don't have any...

342
00:37:15,865 --> 00:37:17,924
Yeah! Sure. I got it.

343
00:37:19,836 --> 00:37:22,361
There you go. You can keep it. Thanks.

344
00:37:25,575 --> 00:37:26,542
How much do you have?

345
00:37:26,609 --> 00:37:27,974
Don't give him all of that.

346
00:37:28,044 --> 00:37:29,978
- It's not gonna be enough.      - It's enough.

347
00:37:30,046 --> 00:37:31,411
- Just give me the...      - It's enough. / Excuse me, sir?

348
00:37:31,547 --> 00:37:32,741
Hey. We need 5 minutes.

349
00:37:32,815 --> 00:37:33,907
- 5 minutes      - Yeah!

350
00:37:35,585 --> 00:37:38,748
Listen, this is a place for grown-ups,

351
00:37:38,821 --> 00:37:40,686
- so behave yourself.      - Shut up.

352
00:37:41,424 --> 00:37:42,755
That sounds about right.

353
00:37:49,098 --> 00:37:52,067
- Choose another.      - Yeah! Show me...

354
00:37:52,168 --> 00:37:53,328
- Concentrate.      - Yes.

355
00:37:53,569 --> 00:37:57,471
- Queen of hearts.      - Okay. Watch. It's already here.

356
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:04,912
Show me... Ace of spades.

357
00:38:09,619 --> 00:38:10,950
Think I know why we're here.

358
00:38:13,723 --> 00:38:15,190
You've got good hands.

359
00:38:15,258 --> 00:38:17,419
- Nick! You alright?      - Yeah.

360
00:38:17,527 --> 00:38:19,757
What's going on? Sit down.

361
00:38:21,264 --> 00:38:22,891
- Vodka martini?      - Thank you.

362
00:38:23,032 --> 00:38:24,192
I'll have one of those.

363
00:38:25,268 --> 00:38:26,394
She'll have a Coke.

364
00:38:26,502 --> 00:38:28,663
My mom drinks when she wants to get really clear images.

365
00:38:28,805 --> 00:38:29,965
She's famous for it.

366
00:38:30,606 --> 00:38:32,130
Maybe something without caffeine.

367
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:33,975
I've got it. Whoa.

368
00:38:34,844 --> 00:38:36,209
There's 5.

369
00:38:37,713 --> 00:38:38,907
Keep the change.

370
00:38:39,015 --> 00:38:39,982
Thank you.

371
00:38:43,419 --> 00:38:44,613
I know who you are.

372
00:38:46,823 --> 00:38:48,188
When I was in Division,

373
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:51,283
her mother was at the top of every watch list there was.

374
00:38:52,428 --> 00:38:53,588
You worked for Division?

375
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:59,028
You want to know about Division?

376
00:39:00,736 --> 00:39:03,830
10 years. No thank you, no pension.

377
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,773
I was put out on the street with a threat to not shift again.

378
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,478
Only the sniffs caught up with me in Chicago.

379
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:13,515
I was just trying to buy something nice for my wife.

380
00:39:14,784 --> 00:39:17,514
Next day I get a call, she's dead.

381
00:39:18,454 --> 00:39:20,012
Car accident.

382
00:39:21,257 --> 00:39:24,192
But my wife doesn't drive.

383
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:30,393
But I don't have to remind you how that feels, right?

384
00:39:37,373 --> 00:39:39,671
- We need this.      - An olive?

385
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:42,209
It's a bead.

386
00:39:43,412 --> 00:39:46,381
It's supposed to lead us to someone we need to find before Division does.

387
00:39:47,984 --> 00:39:49,918
Excuse me! May I?

388
00:39:52,421 --> 00:39:53,615
Thank you.

389
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:55,552
You're welcome.

390
00:39:59,996 --> 00:40:01,020
Got it right?

391
00:40:02,064 --> 00:40:04,464
It's a little more round and shinier.

392
00:40:05,768 --> 00:40:07,167
That's it.

393
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:08,937
That's just how I saw it.

394
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,098
It won't last long.

395
00:40:13,209 --> 00:40:16,940
I'd take it Emily Hu. She's ex-pat sniff.

396
00:40:17,246 --> 00:40:19,737
Only works by referral. Here's her address.

397
00:40:21,417 --> 00:40:22,782
Thank you, Hook.

398
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,614
Bye bye.

399
00:40:26,889 --> 00:40:28,288
Good luck.

400
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,933
That's her comb.

401
00:40:44,307 --> 00:40:46,275
Is she with another man?

402
00:40:58,587 --> 00:41:00,054
Yes

403
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:05,024
I see a man... and a boat

404
00:41:05,227 --> 00:41:06,819
Is she happy?

405
00:41:07,463 --> 00:41:09,124
Will she come back to me?

406
00:41:09,231 --> 00:41:11,927
That was a very big yacht.

407
00:41:19,408 --> 00:41:20,375
May I help you?

408
00:41:20,509 --> 00:41:22,136
Hook Waters sent us.

409
00:41:23,379 --> 00:41:26,473
A bead that looks like this one is supposed to lead us to a girl.

410
00:41:33,856 --> 00:41:35,221
You with Division?

411
00:41:36,425 --> 00:41:37,983
Are you looking at us?

412
00:41:39,261 --> 00:41:41,320
The truth is, the girl who dropped that bead...

413
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:43,990
is supposed to have a suitcase that will bring down Division.

414
00:41:44,066 --> 00:41:47,365
Cassie here thinks that if we don't find it, we die.

415
00:41:47,536 --> 00:41:49,026
And you believe her?

416
00:41:50,673 --> 00:41:52,300
She's pretty convincing.

417
00:41:52,408 --> 00:41:54,774
Well, consider me unconvinced.

418
00:42:02,585 --> 00:42:04,576
Looks like we've just got to wait.

419
00:42:04,754 --> 00:42:05,778
For what?

420
00:42:05,855 --> 00:42:07,618
You have about one minute to help us.

421
00:42:09,625 --> 00:42:10,819
And what's that?

422
00:42:10,993 --> 00:42:13,553
That's your... poster.

423
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:16,991
- That's the bead.      - That's the clock.

424
00:42:17,767 --> 00:42:19,894
- It's... right now...      - You've got about a minute.

425
00:42:23,372 --> 00:42:25,169
You guys can't be serious.

426
00:42:25,274 --> 00:42:26,571
Don't look at me.

427
00:42:26,809 --> 00:42:28,970
This girl's been going at it with that plan all day.

428
00:42:29,178 --> 00:42:31,874
Everything that ends up on this pad seems to be coming true.

429
00:42:32,214 --> 00:42:34,375
I just see it like I'm looking at a photograph.

430
00:42:38,687 --> 00:42:41,053
Look... we want Division out of Hong Kong...

431
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:42,657
just as much as you do.

432
00:42:43,025 --> 00:42:46,051
It's going to be a whole lot easier if you help us find the girl.

433
00:42:47,263 --> 00:42:49,493
You remind me of someone...

434
00:42:49,565 --> 00:42:51,430
I used to know

435
00:42:56,205 --> 00:42:57,536
Fine.

436
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:03,974
They've been spreading these all over the city.

437
00:43:16,058 --> 00:43:20,586
You'll find who you're looking for on Kwun Tong Pier.

438
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:50,051
- Where do you wanna go?      - Hmm?

439
00:43:52,294 --> 00:43:53,591
Excuse me!

440
00:43:55,097 --> 00:43:55,550
Excuse me.

441
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,900
Speak any English?

442
00:43:58,234 --> 00:43:59,394
- No.      - No.

443
00:43:59,502 --> 00:44:03,734
It doesn't really matter. I just need a ride.

444
00:44:05,808 --> 00:44:07,275
We're old friends, right?

445
00:44:09,441 --> 00:44:12,344
Didn't know you were here. Long time no see.

446
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:14,192
You look great! Have you lost weight lately?

447
00:44:14,197 --> 00:44:15,817
I know, I know, I should have called.

448
00:44:15,822 --> 00:44:17,722
Hop in my car.

449
00:44:34,136 --> 00:44:35,364
Whoa, whoa!

450
00:44:36,405 --> 00:44:36,900
Kira?

451
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:38,700
Damm it!

452
00:44:38,908 --> 00:44:40,876
- What the hell are you doing here?      - There goes my ride!

453
00:44:41,443 --> 00:44:43,604
- Don't.      - Don't. Don't what?

454
00:44:43,812 --> 00:44:45,336
You're the girl everyone's looking for?

455
00:44:45,414 --> 00:44:46,779
- I should kill you, Nick.      - Hey!

456
00:44:46,949 --> 00:44:48,246
You know this psycho?

457
00:44:48,384 --> 00:44:50,045
- What happened to you?      - Now you want to know?

458
00:44:50,586 --> 00:44:52,417
What does that suppose to mean? I thought you left.

459
00:44:52,555 --> 00:44:53,544
You stopped returning my calls.

460
00:44:53,656 --> 00:44:55,385
Division caught me and locked me up.

461
00:44:55,491 --> 00:44:57,391
- What?      - And you never came.

462
00:44:57,459 --> 00:44:59,586
I looked for you. I did!

463
00:45:01,564 --> 00:45:02,826
You didn't find me.

464
00:45:03,732 --> 00:45:06,530
It's done! You had a thing. Get over it.

465
00:45:06,835 --> 00:45:09,429
I really suggest we discuss this somewhere else.

466
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,305
Let's go, Nick.

467
00:45:26,222 --> 00:45:28,486
Kira. Division's looking for you.

468
00:45:29,058 --> 00:45:30,889
They're looking for the case.

469
00:45:31,427 --> 00:45:32,655
And so are you.

470
00:45:33,095 --> 00:45:34,585
What's in that case, Kira?

471
00:45:35,164 --> 00:45:36,426
I don't know.

472
00:45:36,832 --> 00:45:38,322
All I know is that I woke up on a boat

473
00:45:38,434 --> 00:45:40,527
next to a note I'd written saying to look for you

474
00:45:40,603 --> 00:45:42,366
and you'd help me find the case.

475
00:45:44,607 --> 00:45:47,167
I don't remember anything about the last couple of days...

476
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:49,675
no matter how hard I try.

477
00:45:50,446 --> 00:45:52,004
You must have had yourself wiped.

478
00:45:53,015 --> 00:45:55,575
Erased memories make it harder for Division to track you.

479
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:59,744
Not the ones of you.

480
00:46:03,225 --> 00:46:04,749
Can I talk to you for a sec?

481
00:46:05,594 --> 00:46:06,788
Can it wait?

482
00:46:07,129 --> 00:46:08,221
I'm kind of in the middle of something.

483
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:09,524
No.

484
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:15,965
You, me, and my mom.

485
00:46:16,972 --> 00:46:19,167
I've never seen my mom's death before.

486
00:46:20,342 --> 00:46:21,570
It's her, Nick.

487
00:46:22,211 --> 00:46:24,975
She's changing the future, and she's making it worse.

488
00:46:25,114 --> 00:46:26,672
- We've got to dump her.      - Dump her?

489
00:46:27,016 --> 00:46:28,313
Cassie, we...

490
00:46:29,618 --> 00:46:30,983
Cassie! We just found her.

491
00:46:31,086 --> 00:46:32,610
And she doesn't have the case.

492
00:46:32,688 --> 00:46:33,655
Which is what we're looking for,

493
00:46:33,789 --> 00:46:35,222
- if you remember.      - Yeah! I know.

494
00:46:36,458 --> 00:46:38,358
We find her, we find the case.

495
00:46:38,427 --> 00:46:40,657
- The 3 of us.      - Yeah, and then Division finds her.

496
00:46:40,829 --> 00:46:42,524
Oh yeah, the 3 of us.

497
00:46:45,768 --> 00:46:47,963
We'll get a shadow so they can't trace her.

498
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:49,731
- Satisfied?      - No.

499
00:46:51,807 --> 00:46:53,138
Cassie, you've got to trust me.

500
00:46:53,208 --> 00:46:55,142
I'm not the one with the trust issues here.

501
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:56,370
You better do something quick

502
00:46:56,445 --> 00:46:58,675
because I'm getting sick of drawing dead bodies.

503
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:29,672
That's him.

504
00:47:31,046 --> 00:47:32,479
- Hey, Pinky.      - Hey, Nick.

505
00:47:32,581 --> 00:47:35,141
- Hey.      - Alright, who's feeling the heat?

506
00:47:37,486 --> 00:47:38,783
Alright.

507
00:47:39,688 --> 00:47:40,985
Here's how this works:

508
00:47:41,056 --> 00:47:43,490
I get 10 grand a day for shadowing Miss Trouble.

509
00:47:43,592 --> 00:47:45,389
As long as she stays within 20 feet of me,

510
00:47:45,461 --> 00:47:46,951
no sniff is gonna find her.

511
00:47:47,029 --> 00:47:48,053
I don't care if they're standing right on top

512
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:49,859
of us with a piece of her fingernail.

513
00:47:50,432 --> 00:47:52,525
- Happy?      - Overcome.

514
00:47:52,835 --> 00:47:54,928
Come on. Let's find a place to think.

515
00:47:57,973 --> 00:48:01,500
So Pinky, your wife give you that name?

516
00:48:02,144 --> 00:48:04,135
No, the Division did, sweetheart.

517
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,277
Back in the day.

518
00:48:15,224 --> 00:48:18,352
I'm sorry. I can't remember anything about the case.

519
00:48:18,861 --> 00:48:20,453
Shocking.

520
00:48:23,832 --> 00:48:25,993
Can I clean up without getting killed?

521
00:48:26,068 --> 00:48:28,093
Don't forget to wash behind your ears.

522
00:48:32,374 --> 00:48:33,932
Nice girlfriend you've got there.

523
00:48:34,009 --> 00:48:36,773
Yeah. She used to be.

524
00:48:36,845 --> 00:48:39,780
I met her running cons on Coney Island tourists.

525
00:48:40,816 --> 00:48:42,807
We did everything together. Everything.

526
00:48:42,885 --> 00:48:44,318
So we're just gonna sit around

527
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:46,149
and wait for her to get her memory back...

528
00:48:46,221 --> 00:48:49,190
and hope that she'll tell us where the case is before Carver gets it?

529
00:48:50,192 --> 00:48:51,591
Or us.

530
00:48:52,428 --> 00:48:53,827
Great plan.

531
00:48:54,329 --> 00:48:55,523
Where you going?

532
00:48:55,731 --> 00:48:58,291
I saw a chicken place downstairs. Want to come?

533
00:48:58,434 --> 00:49:00,925
No, I'm good. I want to stay here, see if I can help.

534
00:49:01,003 --> 00:49:02,300
Have fun with that.

535
00:49:22,458 --> 00:49:23,618
Where you going?

536
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:25,888
Relax, Romeo.

537
00:49:26,028 --> 00:49:28,223
I can shade her just fine out in the hall.

538
00:49:29,832 --> 00:49:32,027
I don't need to be a watcher to see where this is going.

539
00:50:22,818 --> 00:50:24,649
Oh! Sorry about that.

540
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,980
I thought the bathroom was on fire.

541
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:30,820
I had to get you to come in somehow.

542
00:50:31,827 --> 00:50:33,089
Did you push me?

543
00:50:33,228 --> 00:50:34,525
You didn't like it?

544
00:50:36,565 --> 00:50:38,089
Push back.

545
00:51:14,036 --> 00:51:16,834
My father expects me to find that suitcase.

546
00:51:16,905 --> 00:51:18,167
So does my mother.

547
00:51:18,574 --> 00:51:20,974
But you don't see it clearly, do you?

548
00:51:21,443 --> 00:51:23,138
Too many things keep changing.

549
00:51:24,446 --> 00:51:26,471
I already saw how you die.

550
00:51:27,349 --> 00:51:28,782
Did you see it yet?

551
00:51:33,855 --> 00:51:35,379
You can change it, you know.

552
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:37,981
Plenty of planes leaving Hong Kong every day.

553
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:39,789
Oh, we are going to change it.

554
00:51:40,295 --> 00:51:42,320
You put a shadow on the girl.

555
00:51:43,332 --> 00:51:45,459
You know that's only temporary.

556
00:51:46,268 --> 00:51:49,965
That girl is the one who brings all your little fantasies crashing down.

557
00:51:50,572 --> 00:51:52,904
So tell Nick something for me, little girl.

558
00:51:53,342 --> 00:51:56,743
Tell him my family is going to make his brain pop like a tomato.

559
00:51:57,045 --> 00:51:59,809
Tell him that's the future I see.

560
00:52:14,763 --> 00:52:16,196
Oh, boy.

561
00:52:18,333 --> 00:52:19,527
Hello?

562
00:52:21,136 --> 00:52:21,600
There you are.

563
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,600
Where is the chicky-chicky who gets us all killed?

564
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,670
Are you drunk?

565
00:52:25,741 --> 00:52:26,833
Yeah.

566
00:52:27,476 --> 00:52:29,774
I'm sorry. I didn't know the procedure for stopping a blitzed 10-year-old.

567
00:52:29,845 --> 00:52:33,781
I'm 13! And I am powering my use!

568
00:52:33,849 --> 00:52:35,817
I can't believe this.

569
00:52:35,817 --> 00:52:37,114
I am working.

570
00:52:38,086 --> 00:52:40,782
- You screw it all up!      - Alright...

571
00:52:40,856 --> 00:52:42,949
Give me this. What is this? We talked about this, Cassie.

572
00:52:43,025 --> 00:52:44,049
Nobody is going anywhere.

573
00:52:44,126 --> 00:52:45,991
- What is this?      - You don't get it, Nick.

574
00:52:47,329 --> 00:52:49,695
She is the one that kills us all, basically.

575
00:52:49,831 --> 00:52:50,798
Then I guess we're all gonna get killed.

576
00:52:50,866 --> 00:52:52,333
Yeah. Screwed up.

577
00:52:52,434 --> 00:52:54,527
By "we", you mean not...

578
00:52:54,603 --> 00:52:55,695
You, too.

579
00:52:57,172 --> 00:52:59,834
Pop Girl's a better watcher than I am.

580
00:52:59,975 --> 00:53:02,273
Whoa! No one said anything about a watcher.

581
00:53:02,344 --> 00:53:04,369
I can only work long-term against the sniffs.

582
00:53:04,446 --> 00:53:06,744
- Good.      - No! True story.

583
00:53:06,815 --> 00:53:09,147
You've got a watcher after you. It's just a matter of time.

584
00:53:10,419 --> 00:53:12,853
Then we'll split up.

585
00:53:12,988 --> 00:53:15,354
We'll give her 2 things to track instead of one.

586
00:53:15,424 --> 00:53:18,860
- Pinky, take Kira somewhere safe      - I'm not going with him.

587
00:53:19,027 --> 00:53:20,187
No offense.

588
00:53:20,295 --> 00:53:21,819
None taken, cupcake.

589
00:53:21,963 --> 00:53:23,521
I know you're sweet on the champ.

590
00:53:24,066 --> 00:53:25,294
I'll find you.

591
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,075
Let's let her sleep for a bit.

592
00:54:03,548 --> 00:54:05,413
She's one step ahead of our sister.

593
00:54:05,483 --> 00:54:06,751
Pa pa would be very angry.

594
00:54:06,751 --> 00:54:08,116
She saw me coming.

595
00:54:10,955 --> 00:54:12,513
I think you underestimated her.

596
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,316
She still dies!

597
00:54:23,168 --> 00:54:24,726
She's gone, you know.

598
00:54:27,539 --> 00:54:29,200
I'm just saying...

599
00:54:32,711 --> 00:54:35,009
- You okay?      - No...

600
00:54:36,948 --> 00:54:38,882
Not until we find that case.

601
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:41,118
When was the last time you saw it?

602
00:54:41,252 --> 00:54:42,549
Not since yesterday.

603
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:45,619
Not for lack of trying, though.

604
00:54:47,292 --> 00:54:50,784
If we don't find it soon, they're gonna kill my mom.

605
00:54:51,763 --> 00:54:53,253
And it's gonna be my fault.

606
00:55:10,415 --> 00:55:11,780
Look at me.

607
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,908
Hey! Look at me.

608
00:55:14,552 --> 00:55:16,110
You really think I'm gonna let that happen?

609
00:55:17,889 --> 00:55:19,481
You said the future's always changing, right?

610
00:55:19,591 --> 00:55:20,615
It can change just by knowing it?

611
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:23,718
It can change. It doesn't mean it will.

612
00:55:27,165 --> 00:55:28,757
- Good enough.      - What are you doing?

613
00:55:29,334 --> 00:55:30,392
What are you gonna go do?

614
00:55:30,468 --> 00:55:31,901
I'm gonna try and make a better one.

615
00:55:33,171 --> 00:55:35,139
Going after Carver doesn't change anything.

616
00:55:35,306 --> 00:55:36,796
It doesn't save me, it doesn't save you,

617
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,001
it doesn't save her.

618
00:55:38,109 --> 00:55:39,872
It's just a matter of time, Cassie.

619
00:55:39,978 --> 00:55:41,843
If I don't go to him, he'll come for us.

620
00:55:51,189 --> 00:55:52,315
Emily, it's Nick.

621
00:55:53,358 --> 00:55:55,485
Listen, Division sent a pusher named Carver to Hong Kong.

622
00:55:55,593 --> 00:55:56,753
I need you to find him.

623
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:00,511
Just use that bead they gave you.

624
00:56:00,516 --> 00:56:02,031
I'm sure his hands were all over it.

625
00:56:30,562 --> 00:56:32,860
- We're not open yet.      - I'm not hungry.

626
00:57:30,755 --> 00:57:32,279
Henry Carver.

627
00:57:36,227 --> 00:57:39,094
Now there's a face I haven't seen in a long time.

628
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:46,803
Sit down.

629
00:57:47,272 --> 00:57:49,467
The food is actually pretty good here.

630
00:57:55,446 --> 00:57:57,971
Give me one good reason not to kill you right now.

631
00:58:00,151 --> 00:58:01,345
Good.

632
00:58:01,786 --> 00:58:03,651
Gonna try and get inside my head?

633
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:05,887
Go ahead.

634
00:58:05,957 --> 00:58:08,551
See if you can push me before I pull the trigger.

635
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:13,964
Wow! 10 years is a long time to hold a grudge.

636
00:58:14,098 --> 00:58:15,759
My father would disagree.

637
00:58:15,967 --> 00:58:20,028
- You piece of shit.      - Your father I had respect for.

638
00:58:20,138 --> 00:58:22,333
He took a stand with great integrity,

639
00:58:22,407 --> 00:58:24,967
which is more than anyone can say about you.

640
00:58:30,148 --> 00:58:32,810
- If this is your attempt at...      - Think I don't know this future?

641
00:58:33,484 --> 00:58:34,712
Huh?

642
00:58:34,786 --> 00:58:37,812
I've got 20 of the best watchers in the world...

643
00:58:37,922 --> 00:58:40,857
tracking every moment of this time right now.

644
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:43,884
You die, Nick.

645
00:58:45,196 --> 00:58:46,788
You all die.

646
00:58:47,332 --> 00:58:48,731
You know who doesn't?

647
00:58:50,668 --> 00:58:52,533
- Me.      - You sure about that?

648
00:58:55,173 --> 00:58:56,731
Okay.

649
00:58:57,775 --> 00:58:59,936
Kira is our patient zero.

650
00:59:00,378 --> 00:59:03,404
And with her we're going to create an army the world's

651
00:59:03,514 --> 00:59:06,150
- never seen before...      - I'm sorry. Am I supposed to care?

652
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:09,517
Fine. Fuck patriotism.

653
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:13,118
The girl will die unless she receives the necessary injections.

654
00:59:14,826 --> 00:59:17,522
And you're not going to find it anywhere but with me.

655
00:59:19,831 --> 00:59:21,628
Maybe you care about that.

656
00:59:25,803 --> 00:59:27,236
Tell me something, Nick.

657
00:59:28,172 --> 00:59:30,470
Her blood turn black yet?

658
00:59:31,909 --> 00:59:34,139
No? Insides running out?

659
00:59:38,249 --> 00:59:40,649
Or is she keeping that away from you, too?

660
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:49,184
I'll take that as a yes.

661
01:02:00,458 --> 01:02:02,949
You already know the ending to this story.

662
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:05,153
You can only draw it so many ways.

663
01:02:08,199 --> 01:02:09,757
We're going to change it.

664
01:02:13,171 --> 01:02:15,002
You don't believe that, do you?

665
01:02:15,573 --> 01:02:16,972
Please...

666
01:02:18,509 --> 01:02:21,034
don't make me do anything to myself.

667
01:02:22,046 --> 01:02:24,207
Hurting you would change the future.

668
01:02:25,049 --> 01:02:27,108
And I like how this future goes.

669
01:02:28,085 --> 01:02:29,450
So will killing him.

670
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:46,832
Victor!

671
01:03:07,091 --> 01:03:08,956
I think I just saved your life.

672
01:03:10,194 --> 01:03:12,924
There's no need to thank me. You should just start listening to me.

673
01:03:19,437 --> 01:03:20,734
You look like shit.

674
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:41,954
- Where is she?      - 5-A.

675
01:03:42,093 --> 01:03:43,754
- Is she safe?      - Yeah.

676
01:03:43,828 --> 01:03:45,921
She's sick, though. Pretty bad.

677
01:04:34,478 --> 01:04:36,275
I need to ask you a question.

678
01:04:38,516 --> 01:04:40,040
What's in the case?

679
01:04:45,056 --> 01:04:47,320
It's a drug.

680
01:04:47,892 --> 01:04:51,692
Some sort of psychic steroid that boosts our abilities...

681
01:04:52,296 --> 01:04:53,661
but kills us.

682
01:04:58,402 --> 01:05:00,131
They want me back

683
01:05:00,237 --> 01:05:03,206
because I'm the only one... who survived the injection.

684
01:05:08,746 --> 01:05:11,044
Tell me why I just drew a picture of me holding her shoe.

685
01:05:25,196 --> 01:05:26,356
Is she okay?

686
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:30,968
What? No. You've got to be kidding me.

687
01:05:30,968 --> 01:05:32,833
- She's dying.      - You are not bringing me into this.

688
01:05:33,371 --> 01:05:34,497
You're already in it.

689
01:05:35,072 --> 01:05:36,937
We need to know what this key unlocks.

690
01:05:37,842 --> 01:05:39,139
Please.

691
01:05:41,379 --> 01:05:43,313
Cassie, how much do the Chinese know?

692
01:05:43,514 --> 01:05:45,209
Whatever we do. It could be more.

693
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:47,317
Their watcher is better than me.

694
01:05:47,451 --> 01:05:49,885
We know there's a suitcase with a Division drug in it.

695
01:05:49,954 --> 01:05:51,444
Kira hid it somewhere in Hong Kong.

696
01:05:51,522 --> 01:05:52,614
Can you draw us a way out of this?

697
01:05:52,723 --> 01:05:54,520
We can't change anything with that bitch tracking us.

698
01:05:54,658 --> 01:05:56,125
The second we do, she's gonna see it.

699
01:05:56,193 --> 01:05:58,162
- What do you mean?      - She sees intentions.

700
01:05:58,162 --> 01:05:59,720
What we decide to do.

701
01:05:59,797 --> 01:06:02,527
I decide to cross the street, so she sees me crossing the street.

702
01:06:03,033 --> 01:06:04,933
What if nothing we did made sense?

703
01:06:05,836 --> 01:06:07,167
Or we just kept changing our mind,

704
01:06:07,238 --> 01:06:09,331
we didn't know exactly what we were gonna do?

705
01:06:09,774 --> 01:06:11,139
Would that throw her off?

706
01:06:11,208 --> 01:06:13,403
It might, but we still have to find the case.

707
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:27,013
Whatever this key unlocks is being shadowed.

708
01:06:27,491 --> 01:06:29,322
Like I've never seen before.

709
01:06:30,694 --> 01:06:32,059
It's this way.

710
01:06:36,767 --> 01:06:38,428
That really narrows it down.

711
01:06:42,773 --> 01:06:44,968
If it's shadowed, I won't be able to draw.

712
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:57,815
There's a building missing.

713
01:07:04,328 --> 01:07:05,317
I thought shadows weren't supposed

714
01:07:05,396 --> 01:07:07,296
to be effective against watchers like Cassie.

715
01:07:07,364 --> 01:07:08,695
They're not.

716
01:07:09,366 --> 01:07:12,392
We're not supposed to be able to shade entire buildings either.

717
01:07:37,161 --> 01:07:38,924
You wanted to see me?

718
01:07:42,366 --> 01:07:43,958
I'm going to need your help.

719
01:07:48,405 --> 01:07:50,532
Watchers from everywhere are tracking us.

720
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:52,166
Carver... the Chinese...

721
01:07:52,243 --> 01:07:53,972
Anything we think we're gonna do, they know about it.

722
01:07:54,078 --> 01:07:56,478
That's why we all keep dying in Cassie's book.

723
01:07:57,047 --> 01:07:59,675
- Pardon?      - You die outside an elevator.

724
01:08:00,651 --> 01:08:02,084
Oh.

725
01:08:03,521 --> 01:08:05,853
How are we gonna make the future unpredictable?

726
01:08:05,956 --> 01:08:07,924
By not knowing what we're gonna do

727
01:08:08,692 --> 01:08:10,125
until right before we do it.

728
01:08:10,194 --> 01:08:13,129
- Like a plan without planning.      - Yes. Right.

729
01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:14,488
Okay!

730
01:08:15,332 --> 01:08:18,597
I'll write letters to each of you giving you specific instruction.

731
01:08:19,270 --> 01:08:21,033
You don't open them until I tell you.

732
01:08:23,707 --> 01:08:26,267
Then the last letter, I write to myself...

733
01:08:27,778 --> 01:08:29,712
and wipe the memory of ever having written them.

734
01:08:29,847 --> 01:08:32,213
That's why I need you to find the guy that wiped Kira.

735
01:08:33,117 --> 01:08:35,608
- Sure thing.      - That sounds like a great plan.

736
01:08:37,121 --> 01:08:39,646
- Do you have a better one?      - We're flying blind.

737
01:08:39,957 --> 01:08:41,083
Yeah.

738
01:08:43,394 --> 01:08:44,691
Cassie...

739
01:08:44,895 --> 01:08:46,760
I need one more drawing out of you.

740
01:08:47,097 --> 01:08:50,089
I need to know the exact size and shape of that case.

741
01:08:50,234 --> 01:08:51,701
And that syringe.

742
01:10:00,037 --> 01:10:02,631
Our watcher said that the package is here now.

743
01:10:03,207 --> 01:10:04,401
Pa pa,

744
01:10:04,508 --> 01:10:07,068
I know what Division is looking for.

745
01:10:07,177 --> 01:10:08,439
It's a syringe.

746
01:10:10,514 --> 01:10:14,006
With this drug we'll be more powerful than Division.

747
01:10:32,469 --> 01:10:36,530
The girl will die unless she receives the necessary injections.

748
01:10:37,074 --> 01:10:40,373
You're not going to find the stuff anywhere but with me.

749
01:10:46,517 --> 01:10:48,109
You die, Nick.

750
01:10:49,286 --> 01:10:51,481
You all die.

751
01:11:18,949 --> 01:11:20,814
You need the medicine that Carver has.

752
01:11:23,153 --> 01:11:25,212
I'm not gonna watch you die.

753
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:31,289
I'll come back for you.

754
01:11:37,568 --> 01:11:38,933
I promise.

755
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:54,315
When do I open it?

756
01:11:56,553 --> 01:11:58,350
When you start to doubt the truth.

757
01:12:17,975 --> 01:12:20,409
- You know when to open these.      - You sure this is right?

758
01:12:21,478 --> 01:12:22,843
No.

759
01:12:30,387 --> 01:12:31,479
Nick?

760
01:12:33,924 --> 01:12:35,289
Take an umbrella.

761
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:37,593
It's gonna rain.

762
01:12:39,296 --> 01:12:41,127
You be careful, too.

763
01:13:05,455 --> 01:13:07,855
You make us chase you halfway across the world...

764
01:13:07,958 --> 01:13:10,984
then you let a hack like Pinky Stein bring you in?

765
01:13:11,128 --> 01:13:13,494
- I'm sick.      - You're sick?

766
01:13:13,730 --> 01:13:15,197
You don't know what you are.

767
01:13:18,168 --> 01:13:19,533
Victor, pay the man.

768
01:13:40,324 --> 01:13:41,655
Of course.

769
01:13:49,633 --> 01:13:51,396
I knew I wouldn't get paid yet.

770
01:13:51,568 --> 01:13:52,830
Wait here.

771
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:55,165
Were you followed?

772
01:13:55,639 --> 01:13:57,163
I'm never followed.

773
01:13:59,076 --> 01:14:00,338
Where is this guy?

774
01:14:00,878 --> 01:14:02,436
- Which one?      - The yellow one.

775
01:14:02,546 --> 01:14:04,036
- The big one?      - Yep.

776
01:14:36,213 --> 01:14:37,510
Wo Chiang?

777
01:14:41,151 --> 01:14:42,641
You are here about the girl?

778
01:14:42,753 --> 01:14:44,311
You're the one that wiped Kira?

779
01:14:44,955 --> 01:14:49,187
12 years ago, a woman told me an American girl would come.

780
01:14:49,393 --> 01:14:52,157
That was 2 days ago, Kira showed.

781
01:14:54,097 --> 01:14:55,291
I have a job for you.

782
01:14:58,969 --> 01:15:00,834
2 hours ago, I wrote 7 letters.

783
01:15:00,971 --> 01:15:03,132
I need you to erase the memory of ever having written them.

784
01:15:05,842 --> 01:15:08,470
7 letters, 2 hours of memory.

785
01:15:10,147 --> 01:15:12,274
The woman tell me those things.

786
01:15:13,884 --> 01:15:15,715
She did not pay for you, too.

787
01:15:20,157 --> 01:15:22,284
And when you're done, I need you to open this and read it.

788
01:15:25,195 --> 01:15:26,162
7:34pm

789
01:15:26,596 --> 01:15:28,894
- I need a minute.      - As you wish.

790
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:41,040
I'm not gonna wake up and forget who I am, am I?

791
01:16:05,836 --> 01:16:08,737
Wait, wait. No, just... go.

792
01:16:34,297 --> 01:16:35,662
It's all gone.

793
01:16:36,767 --> 01:16:39,895
The future has... disappeared.

794
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:41,502
I lost the connection.

795
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:02,915
Sir, your credential, please.

796
01:17:03,527 --> 01:17:05,256
I'm here for inspection.

797
01:17:07,097 --> 01:17:09,395
I want to know where the lockers are.

798
01:17:09,533 --> 01:17:11,398
The top floor, sir.

799
01:17:11,768 --> 01:17:13,531
You can find them up there.

800
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:15,865
- Up this way?      - Yes.

801
01:17:59,683 --> 01:18:01,446
No problem.

802
01:18:36,052 --> 01:18:37,485
The job is over.

803
01:18:37,554 --> 01:18:39,112
You don't have to shadow the building anymore.

804
01:18:39,256 --> 01:18:40,951
The girl sent me...

805
01:19:01,845 --> 01:19:03,278
Thank you.

806
01:19:03,513 --> 01:19:04,775
You ready?

807
01:19:08,018 --> 01:19:09,713
Right size, right shape.

808
01:19:10,153 --> 01:19:11,518
No problem.

809
01:19:12,322 --> 01:19:14,256
Better hurry. Won't last long.

810
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:31,600
"HIDE"

811
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:35,500
Crap.

812
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:11,800
" Go Home "

813
01:20:35,071 --> 01:20:36,402
The Lord giveth.

814
01:20:42,679 --> 01:20:45,910
Did you really think you could slip out of town with this?

815
01:20:56,693 --> 01:20:59,184
Tell me, was this worth dying for?

816
01:21:17,547 --> 01:21:19,913
No. He dies slowly.

817
01:21:20,016 --> 01:21:23,747
Your sister promised me that and a great deal of money.

818
01:21:38,168 --> 01:21:41,194
Do you know how many people in the world would kill for this drug?

819
01:21:45,041 --> 01:21:46,065
Now...

820
01:21:52,649 --> 01:21:54,116
Where is Cassie?

821
01:21:58,054 --> 01:21:59,885
Get me back on my feet.

822
01:22:18,675 --> 01:22:20,575
You don't seem to be reliable.

823
01:22:31,388 --> 01:22:33,413
Didn't see that one coming, did you?

824
01:22:33,523 --> 01:22:36,048
Do you really want to do this, little girl?

825
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:37,751
I know where the drug is.

826
01:22:37,827 --> 01:22:40,853
More importantly, I know how you die.

827
01:22:40,964 --> 01:22:43,091
Do you want to know what the tiger means?

828
01:22:49,973 --> 01:22:51,338
The drug is here.

829
01:22:51,441 --> 01:22:53,375
See if that will make him love you.

830
01:23:03,353 --> 01:23:04,754
My note says I'm supposed to tell you...

831
01:23:04,754 --> 01:23:07,348
the Division has Kira. 216 Batang Street.

832
01:23:08,591 --> 01:23:11,492
It said a lot on there. Was everyone's that complicated?

833
01:23:12,595 --> 01:23:14,062
I knew you could handle it.

834
01:23:20,437 --> 01:23:22,496
This immuno-suppressant will save your life

835
01:23:22,605 --> 01:23:24,869
and allow you to reach your full potential.

836
01:23:26,810 --> 01:23:29,370
You're going to be a better you, Kira.

837
01:23:33,716 --> 01:23:36,048
You need to accept this reality.

838
01:23:37,554 --> 01:23:39,818
We're not trying to hurt you. Kira.

839
01:23:40,156 --> 01:23:43,057
Matter of fact, your well being means everything to us.

840
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,152
Understand it's not your fault you're forgetting

841
01:23:45,228 --> 01:23:46,855
who you are and running from us.

842
01:23:46,930 --> 01:23:48,488
The drug has side effects.

843
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:50,692
We have no way of knowing the severity.

844
01:23:51,534 --> 01:23:54,765
I want you to know that I blame myself for that, Agent Hollis.

845
01:24:03,346 --> 01:24:05,041
This isn't real.

846
01:24:14,757 --> 01:24:16,952
You volunteered, Kira.

847
01:24:17,627 --> 01:24:19,322
I was against it.

848
01:24:20,563 --> 01:24:23,691
You were certain you'd be the one to survive the drug.

849
01:24:23,933 --> 01:24:27,699
I had to support you. After all, we were partners.

850
01:24:30,006 --> 01:24:31,871
Then you panicked.

851
01:24:35,178 --> 01:24:36,645
Did you think you made it all the way here...

852
01:24:36,746 --> 01:24:39,681
and eluded us for so long without any training?

853
01:24:41,217 --> 01:24:43,242
That's the Division in you. Kira.

854
01:24:44,921 --> 01:24:46,650
Now let me help you remember.

855
01:24:49,893 --> 01:24:51,588
Let me help you remember.

856
01:25:03,172 --> 01:25:06,198
I keep trying to draw something different, but I can't.

857
01:25:08,578 --> 01:25:10,307
It's something to do with how I die.

858
01:25:10,446 --> 01:25:11,470
It's a tiger.

859
01:25:11,748 --> 01:25:13,648
I'm serious.

860
01:25:15,351 --> 01:25:17,546
I don't know how I know, but I just know.

861
01:25:19,455 --> 01:25:22,618
I know I act like I don't care sometimes,

862
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:25,653
- but I don't want to die.      - Cassie...

863
01:25:30,333 --> 01:25:32,096
It's not gonna happen, okay?

864
01:25:32,969 --> 01:25:35,437
Just tell me that I'm a crappy artist and that I'm wrong.

865
01:25:35,572 --> 01:25:39,133
You are a crappy artist and you are wrong.

866
01:25:39,208 --> 01:25:40,334
Listen to me.

867
01:25:41,578 --> 01:25:43,671
You've already done more than enough for everyone.

868
01:25:44,347 --> 01:25:46,110
The only thing you've got to worry about right now

869
01:25:46,215 --> 01:25:48,809
- is keeping yourself safe.      - But how?

870
01:25:50,186 --> 01:25:51,312
Just start walking.

871
01:25:51,454 --> 01:25:52,512
Don't even think about where you're going.

872
01:25:52,589 --> 01:25:55,717
Just keep moving. And don't make any decisions any watcher can track.

873
01:25:56,726 --> 01:25:58,591
And when you come across someplace safe,

874
01:25:59,295 --> 01:26:02,128
you hide. Simple as that.

875
01:26:02,732 --> 01:26:04,927
I don't know how, but I know this is gonna work out.

876
01:26:05,134 --> 01:26:08,160
I promise. No need to be scared. Trust me.

877
01:26:10,373 --> 01:26:11,840
That's more like it.

878
01:26:31,894 --> 01:26:33,122
What are you gonna do?

879
01:26:36,132 --> 01:26:37,326
I can't tell you.

880
01:27:33,741 --> 01:27:35,241
" Wan Chi Market "

881
01:28:04,843 --> 01:28:07,043
One cup of English tea, no sugar.

882
01:28:07,944 --> 01:28:11,444
- 2 Wonton noodles.      - Very cheap. On sale!

883
01:28:11,544 --> 01:28:15,644
- Wonton noodles. - It tastes pretty good. I'm so happy.

884
01:28:15,744 --> 01:28:16,744
Food delivery.

885
01:28:38,046 --> 01:28:39,246
" Registrated "

886
01:29:32,475 --> 01:29:35,444
You make me look like a fool in front of my family!

887
01:29:41,851 --> 01:29:43,216
Don't worry.

888
01:29:51,227 --> 01:29:52,956
You won't remember a thing.

889
01:29:56,365 --> 01:29:58,230
Your mother's very proud.

890
01:30:09,812 --> 01:30:13,270
I want to make a deal. The drug for the girl.

891
01:30:15,885 --> 01:30:17,284
Okay.

892
01:30:18,688 --> 01:30:21,088
Dock 4, Man Yuen Street.

893
01:30:36,973 --> 01:30:38,531
Where is the case, Nick?

894
01:30:38,674 --> 01:30:39,834
Kira!

895
01:30:45,615 --> 01:30:46,912
Go ahead.

896
01:30:49,685 --> 01:30:52,085
Remember that night under the roller coaster?

897
01:30:54,357 --> 01:30:57,155
We parked in the rain and got those little bottles of Jack.

898
01:31:04,734 --> 01:31:07,134
That was the first time you told me you loved me.

899
01:31:10,706 --> 01:31:11,934
He remembers.

900
01:31:14,310 --> 01:31:16,335
I want to hear it from him.

901
01:31:18,714 --> 01:31:20,079
I remember.

902
01:31:23,286 --> 01:31:24,719
It never happened.

903
01:31:27,757 --> 01:31:29,918
We met for the first time yesterday.

904
01:31:31,727 --> 01:31:33,592
You've never been to Coney Island.

905
01:31:35,598 --> 01:31:37,589
Nobody's been to Coney Island.

906
01:31:40,770 --> 01:31:42,499
I used you, Nick.

907
01:31:44,507 --> 01:31:47,567
And the quicker we find that case, the quicker I'll let you forget it.

908
01:31:52,148 --> 01:31:53,911
You might as well.

909
01:31:58,321 --> 01:32:02,087
My card says you have to take the drug. Give me Carver.

910
01:32:02,158 --> 01:32:03,489
It's for you.

911
01:32:11,133 --> 01:32:13,226
- Hello!      - You want the case,

912
01:32:13,436 --> 01:32:14,767
you let them live.

913
01:32:14,971 --> 01:32:17,166
I'll tell you exactly where it is.

914
01:32:22,511 --> 01:32:24,570
- Another?      - Sure.

915
01:32:28,751 --> 01:32:30,309
One for the road.

916
01:33:21,537 --> 01:33:23,164
Don't feel too bad.

917
01:33:23,873 --> 01:33:26,842
That push of Kira's has worked on better men.

918
01:34:18,194 --> 01:34:19,559
4100

919
01:34:42,751 --> 01:34:44,241
Kill him.

920
01:34:46,555 --> 01:34:48,147
If that's alright with you?

921
01:34:49,525 --> 01:34:50,992
The case...

922
01:34:59,168 --> 01:35:00,499
Agent Carver.

923
01:35:10,146 --> 01:35:12,114
The contents of this case are the property

924
01:35:12,248 --> 01:35:13,875
of the United States government.

925
01:35:13,949 --> 01:35:16,611
Government? We are the only government here.

926
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:20,155
Be reasonable. There is no need for anyone to die.

927
01:35:22,558 --> 01:35:25,152
We're not much for diplomacy these days.

928
01:35:34,970 --> 01:35:38,133
Victor! Make me a way out of here!

929
01:35:52,788 --> 01:35:54,119
Kira!

930
01:37:30,052 --> 01:37:31,110
Kira!

931
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:52,966
Kira...

932
01:40:32,367 --> 01:40:35,495
Whoa! I'm impressed.

933
01:40:35,571 --> 01:40:38,734
The engineers are always conservative with their projections...

934
01:40:38,807 --> 01:40:39,774
but this is something else.

935
01:40:39,875 --> 01:40:42,844
Hey! We are on the same side. Remember?

936
01:40:43,045 --> 01:40:44,444
Now why don't you march the men

937
01:40:44,513 --> 01:40:47,175
who tried to kill us off this roof, and we'll call it a day.

938
01:40:48,350 --> 01:40:51,547
Wait! Kira! Don't do this!

939
01:40:51,787 --> 01:40:54,722
It's a push. What Carver told you is a lie.

940
01:40:54,790 --> 01:40:56,485
I'm sure they make a card for this.

941
01:41:01,530 --> 01:41:02,895
Where were we?

942
01:41:03,765 --> 01:41:05,528
Where were we?

943
01:41:27,256 --> 01:41:28,814
You don't want to do that.

944
01:41:29,458 --> 01:41:30,447
Watch me.

945
01:41:30,626 --> 01:41:32,787
You'd be doing me a favor if you did.

946
01:41:32,961 --> 01:41:34,485
What's in that needle will kill you.

947
01:41:34,596 --> 01:41:37,064
I went through hundreds of potentials to find her.

948
01:41:37,933 --> 01:41:39,332
She's our survival.

949
01:41:43,272 --> 01:41:44,398
Look at me.

950
01:41:49,511 --> 01:41:50,773
You know me.

951
01:41:53,482 --> 01:41:54,847
I know you.

952
01:42:00,656 --> 01:42:02,021
Look at me...

953
01:42:03,759 --> 01:42:04,987
Look at me.

954
01:42:11,967 --> 01:42:13,332
Let him do it.

955
01:43:03,085 --> 01:43:04,746
What a waste.

956
01:43:43,392 --> 01:43:45,326
I told you to bring an umbrella.

957
01:43:50,165 --> 01:43:51,962
Thought you said it was gonna rain.

958
01:43:52,534 --> 01:43:54,729
I also told you I get things wrong sometimes.

959
01:44:00,876 --> 01:44:02,969
Maybe it will wash the crap out of your hair.

960
01:44:09,117 --> 01:44:10,846
So where's the real case?

961
01:44:24,666 --> 01:44:25,997
There it is.

962
01:44:27,936 --> 01:44:32,134
How long do you think your mother has been planning this?

963
