1
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,065
Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter..
And Spring

2
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:16,703
Spring

3
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:27,838
Wake up.

4
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,592
- Master!
- Yes, my boy?

5
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,798
Where do you want to go?

6
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,835
I want to pick herbs for medicine.

7
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,134
Then let us go.
Come along.

8
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,400
I'm going to pick herbs now, Master.

9
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:38,198
Watch out for snakes.

10
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:46,057
- Wait for me, Master.
- Yes.

11
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,904
I've picked a lot of herbs, Master.

12
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:04,073
Really? You've picked a lot?

13
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,782
Careful!

14
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:31,134
Stop! Throw this away, my boy.

15
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,738
Why? It looks the same.

16
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:38,610
Even though it looks the same,
this is a deadly plant.

17
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,912
The other one can save lives.

18
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,080
It still looks the same.
How can I know?

19
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:50,328
Look closely. Here at the tip
you can see a white line.

20
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,690
If you ate this plant, you'd die.

21
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:58,225
You mustn't pick
this sort of plant next time.

22
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,270
- Is this one alright to eat?
- Yes, this one is good.

23
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:06,861
Master, there is a stone on my back..
Please take it off.

24
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:10,803
- Does it torment you?
- Yes, Master.

25
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:14,446
Didn't you also do it to the fish?

26
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:16,481
Yes, Master.

27
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,948
Didn't you also do it to the frog?

28
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,813
Yes, Master.

29
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:25,283
Didn't you also do it to the snake?

30
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,291
Yes, Master.

31
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,951
Stand up!

32
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,660
Walk around!

33
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:45,241
I can't walk, it's too heavy.

34
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:50,448
How do you think the fish,
the frog and the snake endured it?

35
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:54,248
It was wrong to do it.

36
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:58,550
Go and find all the animals
and release them from the stones.

37
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:00,955
Then I will release you from yours.

38
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:07,198
But if any of the animals, the fish,
the frog or the snake is dead,

39
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:14,031
you will carry the stone in your heart
for the rest of your life.

40
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:10,162
Summer

41
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:22,425
You look so very healthy.

42
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:35,629
This tree is over 300 years old.

43
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:40,273
You will grow
as healthy as this tree.

44
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:15,772
Greetings.

45
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,843
Come in!

46
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:16,799
Will she recover, wise one?

47
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:21,227
I believe that her soul is suffering.

48
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:26,240
When she finds peace in her soul,
her body will return to health.

49
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:30,908
Please take care of her!

50
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:12,411
Excuse me!

51
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:16,250
You are not allowed to sit on that.

52
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:18,652
The master will be angry with you.

53
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:47,335
Why are you praying all of a sudden?

54
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:22,506
Would you like to come along?

55
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:19,470
Gently!
It must prepared with your true heart!

56
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:39,353
Drink!

57
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:42,326
It will clear your head.

58
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:29,920
The boat is floating away!

59
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,911
Stop it!

60
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:37,604
Stop it!

61
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:02,968
Have you recovered now?

62
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:05,633
Yes, I have completely recovered.

63
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:07,638
Strange.

64
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,705
When I can't see you,
I go insane.

65
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:13,046
What is wrong with me?

66
00:44:14,447 --> 00:44:15,447
No idea!

67
00:46:58,081 --> 00:47:01,016
Cold! It's cold!

68
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:03,512
What shall I do?

69
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,558
I did wrong, Master.
Forgive me.

70
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:15,796
That happens by itself.
It is just nature.

71
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:21,635
Are you still sick?

72
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:23,936
No.

73
00:47:25,476 --> 00:47:28,240
Then it was the right medicine.

74
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:34,847
Now that you have recovered,
you can leave this place.

75
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:37,213
No, Master! She can't!

76
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:44,327
Lust awakens the desire to possess.
And that awakens the intent to murder.

77
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:47,662
Get in!

78
00:51:23,346 --> 00:51:27,442
Autumn

79
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:52,567
That was tiring, huh?

80
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:35,808
MAN, 30, FLEES AFTER MURDERING WIFE

81
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:53,946
You have grown a lot!

82
00:55:55,251 --> 00:55:56,809
Get in!

83
00:56:53,143 --> 00:56:58,240
So? Have you led
a happy life up till now?

84
00:56:58,348 --> 00:57:01,784
Tell me something
interesting about your life.

85
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,756
The world of men has grown
agonizing for you, hasn't it?

86
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:11,090
Leave alone, Master.
Can you not see I am suffering?

87
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,161
What causes you to suffer?

88
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:15,823
My only sin was to love.

89
00:57:16,066 --> 00:57:18,364
I wanted nothing except her.

90
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:20,601
So?

91
00:57:20,703 --> 00:57:23,263
She went with another man.

92
00:57:23,406 --> 00:57:24,896
Ah, that was it.

93
00:57:25,075 --> 00:57:28,272
How can that be?
She said that she'd love only me.

94
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:31,810
- And then?
- I couldn't bear it any more.

95
00:57:31,915 --> 00:57:34,315
Didn't you know beforehand
how the world of men is?

96
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:37,887
Sometimes we have to
let go of things we like.

97
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:41,452
What you like,
others will also like!

98
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:43,424
But still, how could she do that?

99
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:46,287
The bitch!

100
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:50,725
- Is it so unbearable for you?
- Yes!

101
01:00:34,864 --> 01:00:36,764
Master!

102
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:41,302
Master!

103
01:02:09,092 --> 01:02:11,424
Young fool!

104
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:14,986
Young fool!

105
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:55,188
Though you can so easily kill,
you yourself cannot be easily killed.

106
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:59,794
Carve out all of
these characters with the knife.

107
01:05:00,162 --> 01:05:05,259
And while you cut out each one,
drive out the anger from your heart.

108
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,491
Holy one!

109
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:17,867
Holy one!

110
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:45,027
We've come to investigate something.

111
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:17,028
- Drop the knife!
- Otherwise I'll shoot!

112
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:23,968
What are you doing?
Continue cutting!.

113
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:35,813
Prajnaparamita Sutra.
It helps restore inner peace.

114
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:38,611
Please let him finish!

115
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,552
How long will it take?

116
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:43,151
Until tomorrow morning.

117
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:05,609
- No connection.
- No?

118
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:07,579
It's quite a deep valley, isn't it?

119
01:08:29,705 --> 01:08:31,400
What?

120
01:12:17,633 --> 01:12:20,363
They make white paint
from these mussels.

121
01:13:29,805 --> 01:13:31,670
Stand up!

122
01:13:32,307 --> 01:13:34,036
It's time to go!

123
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:51,183
Detective Choi,
let's go as we are.

124
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:28,890
Detective Chi,
the boat won't move.

125
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:37,563
Ah, now it's going.

126
01:18:59,634 --> 01:19:03,161
Winter

127
01:38:42,483 --> 01:38:46,351
And Spring
