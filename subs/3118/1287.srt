00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,710
海军航空兵

3
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,580
为了对抗恐怖攻击威胁

4
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,120
军方已拟出全新计划

5
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,320
运用最先进的

6
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,620
实验性科技

7
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,890
目的是消灭

8
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,500
世界各地的敌人

9
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,760
4百多名飞行员申请参与此计划

10
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,000
3名顶尖飞官雀屏中选

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,730
片名：绝密飞行

12
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,890
鹰爪1号请求指挥中心下达指令
Talon 1 requesting Bitching Betty relay Combat Control commands.

13
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,500
收到，鹰爪1号
Roger, Talon 1.

14
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,100
指挥中心正在传送
Central Prime is transmitting...

15
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,670
加密地形自动侦测卫星影像
...encrypted satellite auto-terrain comparison.

16
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,530
这是指挥官
Talons, this is Operator.

17
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,000
攻击指挥员发出最后指令
PAYCOM has given his final tasking orders.

18
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:23,470
前往攻击目标，准确执行任务
You are to proceed to target and prosecute with precision.

19
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,170
你们是美国海军飞行员
Now, remember, you are pilots of the u.s. Navy.

20
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,510
一定要有完美表现
I expect nothing less than perfection.

21
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,380
收到，执行攻击任务
Roger, skipper. Activating tactical music.

22
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,420
鹰爪2号，请确认
Countermeasure is silent party. Talon 2, confirm.

23
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,320
确认，执行任务
Talon 2 confirms. Music on.

24
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,690
这次任务没有风险
Risk assessment is we have a clean mission status.

25
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,290
展开攻击
Attack commencing.

26
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,710
你死了
Gotcha.

27
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,610
导弹来袭…导弹来袭…
Missile lock. Missile lock.

28
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,380
西边有地对空导弹发射基地 我们遭到导弹攻击
Talon 3, there's a sAM site on the west wall. We got birds in the air.

29
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,030
地对空导弹发射基地被消灭
Talon 2, the sAM site's been erased.

30
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,300
我可不是好惹的
Now, that's how you do it.

31
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,860
鹰爪3号，好样的
Talon 3, that was shit-hot!

32
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,860
鹰爪1号，该你上场了
Talon 1, I expect the same out of you.

33
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,890
准备发射蓝灌导弹轰爆目标
Arming Blue Ferret for penetration detonation.

34
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,390
导弹启动
Missile armed. Missile armed.

35
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,690
海军空战演练场 斐伦，内华达州

36
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,300
一百分满分，没错
Yep, 100 over 100. That's correct.

37
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,570
分数可靠吗？
And I can rely on these numbers?

38
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:10,270
这又不是花式溜冰 他们的命中率是百分百
Well, this isn't figure skating, Ray. You either score or you don't.

39
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,410
国家指挥当局非常满意
National Command Authority's duly impressed.

40
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,640
并同意进行第二阶段
They've given us the go-ahead on phase two.

41
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,080
知道吗？
You know what?

42
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,810
你应该来华府一趟 亲自向参议员做报告
You should come to D.C. and make the presentation to the senators.

43
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,690
芮准将就是这么做
That's how Admiral Rickover got things done.

44
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,830
你也想升准将，对吧？
Admiral. You get my meaning?

45
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,890
我还是让你去进行游说吧
No, I'm flattered, but you do the lobbying.

46
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,650
我不搞政治这一套
Politics is for politicians.

47
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,700
上校？ 我再跟你联络
Captain? I'll get back to you.

48
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,190
冰柜有冰棒，自己拿
There's Popsicles in the cooler.

49
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,840
有葡萄口味吗？ 有葡萄口味吗？
Got any grape? Any grape?

50
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,270
只剩一根，不要抢
I believe there is one left, and don't lose your dignity.

51
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,770
谢了
Oh, thank you.

52
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,270
大伙儿坐吧 接得好
All right, take a seat. Nice catch.

53
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,980
有什么地方需要改进？
Talk to me. Where are the holes? How can we improve?

54
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,020
快说，我没有耐心
Come on. I'm not a patient man.

55
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,050
我急着甩掉地对空导弹 来不及摧毁目标
sorry, I got caught up on that west wall. I had to pull out...

56
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,560
战争是团队运动
War is a team sport.

57
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,060
当攻击目标太多 队友就得互相支援
Those AAA sites were thick. Gave extra time to the sAM sites.

58
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,200
没错，没有需要改进的地方
see, that's your answer. There really was no room for improvement.

59
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,700
韦上尉做的很对
Actually, what Lieutenant Wade did was right.

60
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,770
她摧毁敌方的通讯系统 找出地对空导弹发射基地
she took out their communications and exposed their sAM sites...

61
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,130
好让亨利一举消灭它 这就是我的绝招
...so Henry could lay it down. That's what I do.

62
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,070
一切都很完美 我完全同意
I mean, it was perfect. "Perfect." I'll go along with that.

63
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,010
我只是不想看到你这么臭屁
Much as I hate to see that smile of yours get any smugger.

64
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,850
你脸红啦？
You blushing?

65
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,890
我有好消息
I've got good news.

66
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,320
我们要被派到航空母舰
Tell us we got a carrier, skipper, come on.

67
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,550
没错
Affirmative.

68
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,520
亚伯拉罕林肯号
The USS Abraham Lincoln.

69
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,560
马狄克舰长是我的老同学
Captain's an old classmate of mine, Dick Marshfield.

70
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:37,060
你应该也认识他 我说的舰长就是他
I believe you two know each other. He was the captain I told you about.

71
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,760
他当年是个顶尖飞行员 他也是个黑人
Hell of a pilot in his day. He's black too. He's black.

72
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,700
这个飞行中队有新队员
I'm also gonna be expanding your squadron.

73
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,200
会有一架新战机加入你们
On the carrier, you'll be joined by a new wingman.

74
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,170
第四架战机？
A fourth wingman?

75
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,800
我以为只有三架鹰爪战机
Wait, I thought there were only three Talons in existence.

76
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,420
亨利，怎么了？你好像很不爽
What is the problem, Purcell? You look like you been hit in the gut.

77
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,950
咱们在一起很久，合作无间
For one, captain, we've been flying together for a long time and it's good.

78
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,450
而且这数字不吉祥
And four is an unlucky number.

79
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,650
不吉祥？ 不是质数
unlucky? It's not a prime number.

80
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,230
质数只能被和本身整除
Prime numbers can only be divided by one or itself.

81
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,890
3就是质数，三位一体
Three is prime. The Holy Trinity.

82
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,730
正反合的辩证法则
Thesis and antithesis come together and form the synthesis...

83
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,700
这是美国海军，不是哲学课
This is not a seminar on metaphysics. This is the u.s. Navy.

84
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:21,640
星期三清晨五点整出发 解散
Now, we ship out Wednesday at 0500. Dismissed.

85
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,140
我还要说
Okay. If he'd let me finish, I was gonna say...

86
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:28,110
三人行、三人成虎 三剑客
...Three's Company, Three Stooges, Three Musketeers, three-peat...

87
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,610
三好球出局 三民主义
..."three strikes, you're out," "Three Times a Lady."

88
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,380
三次元 大三元
Three dimensions. Three blind mice.

89
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,220
别忘了还有3P
There's menage a trois. Don't forget that one.

90
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,480
敬咱们三个最佳搭档
To the original three.

91
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,320
干杯 干杯
Cheers to that. Cheers.

92
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,760
干杯 敬各位朋友
Cheers. And assorted guests.

93
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,090
干杯
Cheers.

94
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,880
我马上就回来
I'll be back in a second.

95
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,480
我得去尿尿
I gotta go pee-pee.

96
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,650
拜托
That's nasty.

97
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,790
至少她自己会大小便
At least she's potty-trained. I'll give her that.

98
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,520
奇普欧 不可能
Chip O'Dell. No way.

99
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,930
一定是他 第四个队友一定是他
Yeah, it's gotta be him. Hey, Henry, our fourth wing. It's gotta be him.

100
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,200
他一直想抢你们的位置
He tried to manipulate his way into the program, but you two beat him.

101
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,900
不过麦贝琪比他更高杆
Yeah, but Becky Martinez could fly circles around O'Dell.

102
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,910
两个女飞官？不可能啦 那可不一定
Two out of the four are women? No. Hey, you never know.

103
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,380
他好大男人主义哦 且慢，这不是真的
God, you're such a chauvinist. Hold on, now, that's not true.

104
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,850
我很乐意向女性低头认输
I bow down before the superiority of the opposite sex in many respects.

105
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,320
不过有时候
But from time to time...

106
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,530
她们也该向我低头
...I believe they should bow down before me.

107
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,990
拜托 卡莉，你不同
Oh, please. Kara. Kara, listen. You're different.

108
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,260
你独一无二 没错
You are a singularity. Absolutely.

109
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,200
你是大自然的突变
You're a freak. Of nature.

110
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,360
多谢夸奖哦 不客气
Well, thank you, Henry, I think. You are very welcome.

111
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,800
你知道我怎么想吗？
You know what I think?

112
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:02,270
别想，喝就对了
Don't think. Drink.

113
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,710
玩得开心点
Have fun.

114
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:06,270
亚伯拉罕林肯号，菲律宾海

115
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,710
很壮观的夜空
spectacular night, huh?

116
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:20,840
既黑暗又神秘 班，你不喜欢惊喜吗？
Dark and mysterious, sir. Don't you like surprises, Ben?

117
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,880
他来了
Well, here he comes now.

118
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,270
来见见你的新队友
Meet your new wingman.

119
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,760
让我介绍数字化战争的未来 提姆
Allow me to introduce the future of digital warfare. Tim?

120
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,840
请为提姆打开驾驶舱
Open for Tim, please.

121
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,910
燃料：催化甲烷
Fuel, catalyzed A1 methane.

122
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,740
机身：陶瓷合成金属
Exoskeleton, metal-ceramic composite.

123
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,180
气动弹性机翼
Aeroelastic wings.

124
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:35,980
脉冲爆震引擎外加 双混合冲压式涡轮引擎
Pulse detonation engine with twin hybrid scramjet turbos.

125
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,750
艾迪能在五英里外辨识身份
EDI's sensors can pick out a face five miles away.

126
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:43,800
那就订做三台吧 我要敞蓬，车牌上写我的名字
so we'll take three. Drop the top on mine, personalized license plate.

127
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,090
这是智慧型无人战机
so this is one of these smart uCAVs.

128
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:49,600
这么说未免太小看他了
Well, technically you could call it an unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle.

129
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:52,170
你不会说航空母舰是艘帆船吧？
But that would be like calling this carrier a rowboat.

130
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,470
你说的对，这玩意我也懂
I feel you, captain. I know a bit about this.

131
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,130
这是量子处理器，对吧？ 对，这是第一台
This is quantum processing, right? Yeah, it's the first tested application.

132
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,610
每秒处理十兆位
Ten terabits a second.

133
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,340
无人战机为什么有驾驶舱？
so if it's a uCAV, why does it have a seat?

134
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,610
那是为了测试和维修
The cockpit's just for testing and maintenance.

135
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,980
艾迪他会自己飞
Otherwise, EDI flies all by himself.

136
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,720
你是说“它”吧？
You mean "itself," don't you, sir?

137
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:13,850
原来你说的就是这玩意儿
so this is what the fuss is all about.

138
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,460
这是超先进隐形战机
You're looking at VLO stealth, captain.

139
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,600
它的能力超越极限
It's got a brain like a quantum sponge.

140
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:23,570
它的表现会打破所有记录
And one day, its survivability is going to fly right off the charts.

141
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,170
韦上尉 幸会，长官
Lieutenant Wade. It's good to meet you, sir.

142
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:29,570
它果然令人汗为观止
It is a bag of chips, all right.

143
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,810
卜上尉 我的荣幸，长官
Lieutenant Purcell. Honored to meet you, sir.

144
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,110
它会取代我们大家
It will replace us all.

145
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,480
乔治，这看起来像科幻小说
Looks and sounds like science fiction, George.

146
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,750
科幻小说的情节也可能成真
Well, so did everything, once upon a time.

147
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,820
你说的对
Ain't that the truth.

148
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,250
贾先生，欢迎回来
Mr. Gannon. Good to have you back.

149
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:50,660
你之前的飞行中队仍然保持…
Your first squadron tour still holds some of the ship's most...

150
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,530
惊人的记录
...impressive records.

151
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,500
谢谢你，马舰长 记录一定会被打破
Thank you, Captain Marshfield. Records are made to be broken.

152
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:58,370
规矩也一样，这是你的作风
Rules too, if I remember your philosophy.

153
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,270
康上校，副舰长卡尔森
Captain Cummings, this is my X O, Mr. Carlson.

154
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,700
卡尔森
Carlson.

155
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,810
咱们待会在飞行甲板上见
Why don't you meet me up on the flight deck after you're through.

156
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,570
没问题 恭喜了，乔治
You bet. Congratulations, George.

157
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,010
谢谢 很高兴再见面，狄克
Thank you. Good to see you again, Dick.

158
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,380
我也是
You too.

159
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:14,250
它在发出低鸣声 不，艾迪是在动脑筋
It's humming. No, EDI's thinking.

160
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,860
动什么脑筋？ 查你们的底细
Thinking? Thinking about what, sir? You. All of you.

161
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:21,760
他在查你们的档案 你们所有的飞行记录
He's going over your files. He's reviewing all your flight logs.

162
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,920
让它飞一飞，看看它的能耐
Let's take it for a spin, see what it can do.

163
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,900
等到明天再说
No, no, no. Tomorrow.

164
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,830
你们得先做功课 功课？
First, you gotta do your homework. Homework?

165
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,040
谢谢 谢谢
Thank you. Thank you.

166
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:39,000
EDI无人战机 极限深度侵略者
"EDI uCAV. Extreme Deep Invader."

167
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,440
也有人这么形容过我
Yeah, I've been called that a few times.

168
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,170
这笑话超冷的 是喔
I've heard that one. Yeah, right.

169
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,100
你好，帅哥
Well, hello, gorgeous.

170
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,670
EDI 深度攻击结构

171
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,710
武器系统与攻击战略

172
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:25,080
拜托，别偷拍，拜托
Please, no pictures, please. No pictures, please. Please.

173
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,750
好啦，尽管拍吧
Okay, take them. Take them. Take them.

174
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,700
门没锁
It's open.

175
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,970
休息时间
study break.

176
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,740
你很不用功哦
You are one big study break.

177
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,280
我天生聪明
Just a natural.

178
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,810
原来你是靠头脑把妹
so that is the appeal.

179
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,420
怪不得你专门
Okay, because I was really wondering how you manage...

180
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,180
泡金发尤物
...to pull a rocket scientist at every port.

181
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:58,590
你最好小心点 金发尤物可不好惹
You better be careful, Ben, you know. Hair bleach causes cancer in rats.

182
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,620
放心，我的经验丰富
Well, I'm not a rat. That's my appeal.

183
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,460
你很用功嘛 对啊
You checking out the drone? Yeah.

184
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,000
这玩意真的很精密复杂
Just barely skimmed the surface.

185
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,870
未来会是艾迪的时代 艾迪
We really are in the era of EDI. EDI.

186
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:15,200
我有没有提过我的养母？
Did I ever tell you about that foster mother I had?

187
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,440
体重一百五十公斤 没有
The one who weighed 350 pounds? No.

188
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:22,550
有一天她带了一只吉娃娃回家
Anyway, one day she comes home with this Chihuahua, right?

189
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,950
你猜他叫什么？艾迪
Guess what she named him. Eddie.

190
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,350
我又知道你另一个泡妞绝招 什么？
You know what I realized about you? What?

191
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,820
你老爱说养母的冷笑话
You got a foster mom for every situation.

192
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,860
我的童年悲惨，不用白不用
Hey, I lived through my childhood. I may as well use it, right?

193
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,590
是啊
That's right.

194
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,570
你同意马舰长的话
so tell me, you think Marshfield's right?

195
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,300
我们会被机器取代吗？
You think they're gonna trade us all in for that machine?

196
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:49,270
不可能，打仗要靠武器
No way. War is about tools. Think about it.

197
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,340
从徒手到棍棒，铜器到铁器
Claws to clubs, bronze to steel.

198
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:54,540
最顶尖的战士才能赢 或是女战士
Best guy with the best weapon wins. Or girl.

199
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,340
大家都知道你是捍卫女战士
And we all know who that is, don't we?

200
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,850
你这话好像有点酸溜溜哦
The dull thud of a Ben Gannon compliment.

201
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,630
嗯…
Well...

202
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,200
小心我的C罩杯
Oh, pardon my C cup.

203
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,430
休息时间结束
study break is over.

204
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:37,490
早安，林肯号
Good morning to the crew of the uss Abraham Lincoln.

205
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,090
任何异物都会破坏喷射引擎
Remember, foreign-object debris can ruin a jet engine.

206
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,920
大家一起检查飞行甲板
Let's keep our safety record. Scour that deck.

207
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,090
咱们都老了，怎么回事？
Hey. Feel like we got older, Dick. What the hell happened?

208
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,170
至少你的头发还在
Don't complain. You still got your hair.

209
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,670
也只剩一点了
Yeah. some of it.

210
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,840
老实说
Look, truth be told...

211
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:01,280
我并不想让你在我的舰上做实验
...I never wanted this little experiment of yours on my ship.

212
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:04,140
你不是唯一的一个人
Well, you're not hurting my feelings, Dick.

213
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,580
史准将也不赞成
Admiral spelling shared your point paper with me...

214
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,850
我会把你的意见反应上去
...and your objections were duly noted.

215
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:13,120
你一向都很有政治手腕 没办法，这是官僚制度
You always could work the politics. It's indispensable in a bureaucracy.

216
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:16,020
我的舰上可没有官僚制度
This isn't a bureaucracy, not out here.

217
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,430
当你急着使用全新武器系统
You rush a weapons system into service...

218
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,430
忽略必要的测试程序 就可能会死人
...you shortcut an operational test cycle, people might get killed.

219
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,470
没经过允许我绝对不敢乱来
You know I can't pick my nose here without 7000 people approving it.

220
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,440
没有人忽略任何程序
Nobody rushed a damn thing.

221
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,240
这项计划只是提早完成
Program is just ahead of schedule.

222
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,780
你忽略了这玩意
You missed this.

223
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,110
我在你们前面
I'm out first, boys.

224
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,150
我就跟在你屁股后面
I'm right on that ass.

225
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,220
你们先请吧
After you, ladies.

226
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,290
鹰爪2号升空
Talon 2, airborne.

227
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:26,590
鹰爪3号升空
Talon 3, airborne.

228
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,770
鹰爪号升空，航向2-5-4
Talon 1 is off and heading 2-5-4.

229
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,040
启动无人战机
Deploying unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle...

230
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:38,840
极限深度侵略者
...Extreme Deep Invader now.

231
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:52,050
我没想到会有这一天
I never thought we would see this day.

232
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,780
我也没想到
Me neither, sir.

233
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,810
艾迪，你可以升空了
uCAV EDI, you have launch.

234
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,940
进行编队飞行，请确认
One to uCAV. Confirm flight link. Over.

235
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:52,420
编队飞行，确认
Flight link confirmed, Talon 1.

236
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:55,280
很高兴能加入飞行中队
It is good to be part of the squadron.

237
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,080
哇塞，他会讲话耶
What? Well, well, well. He can talk.

238
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,920
那有什么了不起 我朋友的宝马轿车也会说话
Big deal. I know a guy's BMW, does exactly the same thing.

239
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,640
给我影像
Picture, please.

240
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,410
是，长官
Aye, aye, sir.

241
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,580
启动适应性逻辑系统
swarm logic activated.

242
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,950
班，艾迪是来向你学习
All right, Ben. EDI's here to learn from you.

243
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,390
你要把一身本领都教给他
so let's make sure these lessons are up to speed, all right?

244
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,620
那就开始上课吧
Well, then, let the schooling begin.

245
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,300
康上校
Captain Cummings.

246
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,650
请进来一下
Inside, please.

247
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,070
什么事？ 你有一项新任务
What's the deal? You, sir, have a new tasking order.

248
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,950
你们看到无人战机吗？
One to wing, anybody got a visual on the uCAV?

249
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,780
没看到 我也没看到
Negative, 1. Negative, 1.

250
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,450
快让它归队
We better find him and regroup.

251
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,690
别让它趴趴走
Before it takes a crap in its quantum pants.

252
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,090
等一下
Wait up. Hold on.

253
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,400
他在干什么？
What the hell is he doing?

254
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,930
他来了，他来了
Here he comes. Here he comes.

255
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,870
那个小兄弟在耍我们
I think little brother is messing with us.

256
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,340
你的位置永远在我右侧
uCAV, your position is always on my starboard side.

257
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,880
另一边
Other starboard.

258
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,390
超炫的
That's hot.

259
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,250
它没有心，不过蛮会飞的 这个锡人还不赖嘛
Got no heart, but it sure can fly. That's not bad for a tin man.

260
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:48,330
艾迪，你有新的呼号 你的呼号是锡人一世
EDI, it's official. You got a call sign. uCAV "Tin Man" EDI, the first.

261
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,700
呼叫飞行中队 请说
Operator to squadron. Go for Talons.

262
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,040
改变计划
There's been a change of plans.

263
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,480
你们有新的任务
We're giving you an emergency mission redirect. Repeat.

264
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,950
全新的紧急任务，收到吗？
That's an emergency redirect. Do you read me?

265
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,680
收到，什么任务？
Roger. Where's the fire, skipper?

266
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,980
攻击指挥员发出全新指令
PAYCOM has given us a brand-new tasking order.

267
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,990
请接收加密档案
Please access your encrypted file...

268
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,290
档名是备战状态指示
...named "Advanced War Vector scenarios."

269
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:19,930
档案打开了，请说
File's open. Go ahead.

270
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,930
防火墙密码是恐怖高峰会
All right. Firewall code is "Terror summit."

271

无人战机怎么办？
One to Control, what about the uCAV?

279
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,860
艾迪要跟去观察你们的行动

295
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:59,760
我们的武器无法摧毁目标
Roger. We're not weaponized for something that thick.

296
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,420
重覆，无法摧毁目标
Repeat, not weaponized.

297
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,130
杀伤范围有多少人口？
This is 2. What's the population of the collateral area?

298
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:10,300
大楼本身空无一人 但是它位于仰光市中心
The building's unoccupied, but it's in the middle of downtown Rangoon.

299
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,310
这栋大楼的屋顶
This is 3. Talk to me about that roof.

300
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,610
用什么武器才能炸穿？
What's Primo advocate to ordinance and influence?

301
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,610
鹰爪战机没有适用的武器
Primo says Talons can't penetrate it.

302
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:20,650
这是唯一的机会 以后就逮不到他们了
This is our chance. We may never catch these bastards together again.

303
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,850
采用横向攻击
Try a lateral vector.

304
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,620
照他的话做
Just do what he says.

305
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,060
这是鹰爪号
This is 2 to Control. Risk assessment officer adVises...

306
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:33,560
横向攻击会造成数千人伤亡

318
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:56,270
我们即将到达攻击目标

快点，我们锁定目标了
Come on, Control, we have our targets.

321
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:04,820
快想出其它办法 这些恐怖份子是我们的囊中物
Come on. I need an alternative. We got these guys in the bull's-eye.

322
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,760
有另一个可行的方法
There is an alternatiVe, Combat Control.

323
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,700
无人战机，快说

326
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:22,840
电脑说它无法达到穿透速度
Central Prime says truncheons can't achieve velocity for penetration.

327
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:26,570
只剩37秒，赶快解释
One to uCAV, 37 seconds to primary. Come on, explain.

328
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:30,810

329
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,250
导弹能够成功穿透屋顶
Bomb will successfully penetrate roof.

330
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,620
极速垂直俯冲晕厥机率是多少？
What's the blackout risk at vertical 2070?

331
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:39,420
七成三 23秒后到达目标
Seventy-three percent. Time on target is 23 seconds.

332
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:42,930
取消任务，不值得冒险 鹰爪号撤退
Call it off. It's not worth the risk. Operator to Talons, pull back.

333
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,930
让艾迪发射导弹 上校
EDI will plant the truncheon. Captain.

334
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,400
这就是无人战机的作用
This is what we built this machine for.

335
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:51,330
它不是血肉之躯 不会昏过去
There's no blood in those quantum veins. It can't black out.

336
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,870
重覆，让艾迪发射导弹
Operator to Talons, repeat, EDI will plant the truncheon.

337
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,480
不行，这项任务重大 让我执行任务
Control, negative, Control. Mission critical. One will prosecute.

338
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,200
这是3号，我挺你
This is 3 to 1. I got your back...

339
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,680
不过你若昏倒会造成重大伤亡
...but if you black out, you're gonna kill everyone.

340
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:07,340
放心，我不是那七成三的逊脚
Negative, 3. I did not get this far by being in the 73rd percentile.

341
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,190
我一定会成功
I like my odds.

342
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,350
我命令你撤退
Talon 1, your orders are to stand down.

343
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,460
收到吗？ 收到…
Do you read me, lieutenant? I do...

344
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,520
鹰爪号，立刻撤退 好像传送…
Talon 1, stand down. I'm having...

345
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,130
你能？…
Can you...? Can you...?

346
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,640
加油
Go, baby, go.

347
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:16,650
一百节后达到极速

349
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,360
他的血压剧增

350
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,310
达到极速
Release Velocity attained.

351
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,880
发射导弹

Nine, eight...

354
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,690

...seven, six...

355
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:08,870
5，4，3
...fiVe, four, three...

356
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,670
2，1
...two, one.

357
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:42,530
这是鹰爪号 刚才失联了一下子
This is 1 to Control. Looks like we lost radio contact for a second there.

358
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:46,080
好样的，我对你有信心
There you go. I wasn't worried, baby. I wasn't worried.

359
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:49,650
启动适应性逻辑系统 进行匿踪飞行

366
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,720
没错
Yep.

367

乔治
Oh, and, George...

368
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,880
第一次任务很成功
...hell of a first mission.

369
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,820
谢谢你，舰长
Thank you, captain.

370
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:37,030
我要去舰桥

372
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,270
1号和无人战机艾迪准备进场
Talon 1 and uCAV EDI are on approach.

373
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:50,600
艾迪先降落，我殿后
Roger, Control. uCAV will go first. I'll take the last trap.

374
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,510
艾迪，请确认
uCAV, confirm you've got the ball.

375
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:56,070
确认，锡人准备降落
Confirmed, Talon 1. Tin Man will land next.

376
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:16,570
艾迪被闪电击中
Okay, 1 to Control, we've had a lightning strike.

377
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,670
无人战机机身摇晃
The uCAV's very unstable.

378
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,970
更改降落顺序，我先进场
Landing sequence is altered. I'll go in first...

379
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,630
无人战机需要安全网
...but the uCAV is gonna need the net.

380
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,550
你降落得真好
Nice landing, ma'am.

381
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:41,290
准备拉起安全网
On the flight deck, stand by to rig barricade.

382
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:51,260
无人战机准备迫降
Extreme Deep InVader aircraft inbound for crash landing.

383
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,210
快拉起来，拉起来
Pull it out! Pull it out! Pull it out!

384
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:06,440
等一下，够了 低一点…
Hold on! stop! stop. stay low, stay low! Pull low!

385
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,320
右侧，右侧
Pull starboard! Pull starboard!

386
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,770
无人战机进场了
Clear the deck!

387
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,000
快点，快点
Move it! Move it! Move it!

388
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:07,710
你吓我一大跳 抱歉，我睡不着
You scared me. sorry, just a bit restless.

389
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:11,980
你被电得很惨 就像洗泡泡澡被吹风机电到
Really got whacked tonight, right? Like a hair dryer in a bathtub.

390
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:14,640
我拆掉语音识别器，他听不见
Oh, he can't hear you. I pulled his voice recog.

391
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:18,880
等它可以出来撇尿了 我再把它当成人
I'll call it a "he" when it gets out of its cockpit and takes a piss, how's that?

392
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:22,990
你没事吧？ 没事
You all right? Yeah.

393
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:26,860
只是跳电而已
It's just a power surge, that's all.

394
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:30,090
这正常吗？ 正常？
And that's normal? Normal?

395
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,140
我给你看样东西
Let me show you something.

396
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:43,510
这是艾迪之前的神经网络
That was EDI's neural network.

397
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:48,040
你看看
Now, check this out.

398
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:54,750
他被闪电击中后 就开始写这些程序
I mean, ever since the lightning strike, he's just been writing all of this...

399
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:57,400
也许是电脑语言或是密码
I don't know. A language or a code.

400
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,620
这代表什么？
And what does it mean?

401
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,730
我不知道
Yeah. "Mean."

402
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,300
只有它的设计者
The person that could really answer that question...

403
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:06,960
天基斯才知道 天基斯？
...is its designer, Keith Orbit. Orbit?

404
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:10,470
那家伙姓天？ 是啊
The guy's name is Orbit? Yeah, I know.

405
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,980
他22岁就替猛禽战机设计程序
He did all the Al on the Raptor when he was 22...

406
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:18,170
我猜他觉得他的本姓太平凡了
...and I guess, after that, he decided that his given name was too earthly.

407
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:24,420
请关掉电源
Off for Tim, please.

408
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:27,120
至少这首歌很赞
At least it's a good song.

409
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:32,590
他上网下载了歌曲
He downloads songs from the Web.

410
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,390
几首歌？
Yeah? How many?

411
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,400
全部
All of them.

412
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,240
你会被唱片公司告上法院
You're in a peck of trouble with the record companies there, son.

413
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,340
班，你能…？
Ben, could...?

414
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:57,050
我知道空中作战有多危险
I saw how serious that shit is up there.

415
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:02,320
艾迪的设计程序 能够进行自主性演化
so I think it's only fair that I tell you that EDI's been designed to evolve.

416
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,260
很可能变得难以预料 让我问你
It's just unpredictable... Let me ask you something.

417
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:12,060
请你直接告诉我 你对这架战机有信心吗？
Just between you and me, do you have confidence in this plane?

418
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:17,140
你的答案很明显
There's your answer.

419
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,740
门没锁
It's open.

420
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,380
坐下来
Have a seat.

421
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:28,610
我得分，你输定了
"Waffle" for 15 points. I'm kicking your ass, buddy.

422
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:30,590
你没作弊吧？
You didn't cheat, did you?

423
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,750
我的字典没有作弊这两个字
Cheating's not part of my vocabulary.

424
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:37,160
你的战机需要维修
Listen, I scheduled your jet for a little maintenance.

425
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:40,560
最好把无线电通讯器修好
I gotta get the bugs out of that radio, don't you think?

426
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:43,070
那是非常情况，我做了决定
It was a difficult situation and I made a decision.

427
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,790
你犯了错误
You made a mistake, Ben.

428
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:47,370
我知道你认为我不服从命令
sir, there's a thin line between insubordination and...

429
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,800
那不是你犯的错
No, no, no, that's not the mistake you made.

430
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:53,070
你犯的错是和一台机器赌气
Your mistake was getting competitive with a machine.

431
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,480
我是飞行中队队长
I'm the point of the sword up there, sir.

432
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,840
我以一百分满分完成任务
And I pulled it off, 100 over 100.

433
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:01,950
没错，我要恭喜你 大家都打电话来致贺
Yes, indeedy, and I congratulate you. Calls have been coming in all night.

434
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,720
但是问题还是一样
But that doesn't change the issue.

435
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:06,150
问题是什么？
What is the issue, then?

436
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,230
来根雪茄？ 不了，谢谢
Would you like a cigar? Thank you, no.

437
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:10,660
你确定？ 确定，谢谢
You sure? Fine, thank you.

438
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:13,160
这是古巴女人卷的雪茄哦
Rolled on the thighs of mulatto women.

439
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,870
你在怕什么？
What are you afraid of, Ben?

440
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,340
被取而代之吗？
Being replaced? Is that it?

441
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:23,500
你怕被艾迪抢走饭碗？
You afraid EDI's gonna take your job?

442
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,970
不是，老实说
No. No, to be honest with you...

443
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:29,880
我只是觉得战争不是电玩游戏
...I just don't think war should become some kind of video game.

444
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,810
你想看到士兵阵亡吗？
And how do you feel about black body bags?

445
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:36,720
我该怎么向他们的母亲交代？
What am I supposed to tell all the weeping mothers?

446
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:39,860
本来可以不必牺牲她们的儿女
We could've got the job done without sacrificing their children...

447
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:42,550
我们却非得遵循传统…
...but no, we decided not to because of what?

448
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:44,460
是吗？ 并不是遵循传统
Tradition? Not tradition, it's...

449
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:47,620
我们有电脑没有的优点
Look, we have things those computers can never have...

450
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,670
像是直觉、情感和道德判断
...like instincts and feelings and moral judgment.

451
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,810
你可以说我思想保守
You can call me old-fashioned, you can call it whatever you want...

452
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:56,070
但是我认为作战…
...but I just don't think that in war...

453
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,540
一定要考虑到后果
...the action should ever be divorced from the consequences.

454
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,740
我每次派你们挂载炸弹出任务
You don't think I consider the consequences...

455
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:04,610
难道就没有考虑后果吗？
...every time I send you up there with bombs?

456
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,310
我知道你有 我花了毕生精力
I know you do, sir. I've dedicated my life...

457
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:09,040
考虑后果
...to considering the consequences.

458
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:13,750
我对这架战机有不好的预感
I got a bad feeling about this plane.

459
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,490
我只是觉得它需要…
I don't know, I think it needs more...

460
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:20,460
做更多测试才能实际参战
I don't know, trials before it's ever put in a combat situation again.

461
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,230
你跟马舰长谈过吗？
You been talking to Marshfield?

462
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,660
你才是我的直属上司 没错
sir, you're my commanding officer. That's right.

463
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:31,530
我有百分百信心才会让它上战场
And I guarantee you this thing will be 100 percent before I risk it in the field.

464
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,650
听我说，班
Look, Ben...

465
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:37,770
只要再成功完成一项任务
...all we need is one more successful mission...

466
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:40,980
这项计划就能获得肯定
...and this project will be out of the stovepipe and into the light.

467
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:43,850
你挺不挺我？
Are you with me on this?

468
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:47,050
我一定会力挺你到底 那就好
I'm here to make it happen, sir. All right.

469
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:50,790
我安排你们休个假 这是你们应得的
I've arranged a little R and R for you and your team. You've earned it.

470
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,190
也许去泰国
Thailand maybe.

471
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,430
我们才刚到这儿
We just got here.

472
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:58,530
没错，不过这次任务会很长
Yeah, but this could turn out to be a long tour.

473
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:03,800
有机会就先度个假 这件事等你回来再说
You better take it while you can get it. We'll pick this up when you get back.

474
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,270
嗨，我是亨利
Hey, how you doing? Henry Purcell.

475
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:08,900
来自美国 我是个飞官，你想飞吗？
I'm from America. Look, I fly jets. You like to go fast?

476
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:16,500
这是未来走势，而且很有效 我并不觉得有效
B, it's the future and it works. I don't think it works.

477
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,140
这就是科技的功能
It's just technology.

478
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:21,440
它能保护我，让我活命
You know, it's here to make me safe. It keeps me alive.

479
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:22,840
艾迪也一样
EDI is no different.

480
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,310
你觉得它能保护你？ 他能帮我
You think it keeps you safe? Yeah. He's here...

481
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,350
完成任务
...to help me get the job done...

482
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,320
全身而退
...keep me in one piece...

483
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:31,420
让我回家吃团圆饭
...so I can visit my folks for Thanks giving.

484
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,360
我们的安全不是重点
Anyway, our safety's not the point.

485
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:37,960
打仗一定会死人 如果不会，我们就会肆无忌惮
War's meant to be terrible. If it stops being terrible, what's gonna stop us?

486
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:40,760
把战争当成电玩游戏 只要派出艾迪就搞定
It's become some kind of sport. Just send in the EDIs.

487
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,920
但是它是中立的
Yeah, but it's neutral.

488
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,470
怎么说？ 艾迪
What? I mean, EDI...

489
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:49,170
在好人手中就不会做坏事
...if it's controlled by moral people, then it'll be moral.

490
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,140
我不是好人
Oh, I know I'm not moral.

491
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:54,770
我现在满脑子都想干坏事
As a matter of fact, I should be arrested for the thoughts I have now.

492
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,280
我说了什么？
I say something?

493
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:04,480
恕我失陪，我得去尿尿
Well, you boys will have to excuse me. I have to go pee-pee.

494
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:09,160
你也要去吗？ 好
Do you wanna go? Okay.

495
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:21,830
怎么了？ 你心知胜明
What? You know what.

496
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,530
别紧张，我们没事
Take it easy. Nothing's happened.

497
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:28,770
一定有事，只是还没做出来
No, something's happened. You just ain't done anything about it.

498
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,050
糟糕
shit, man.

499
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,280
我也不希望发生这种事 拜托
I didn't want for this to happen. Come on.

500
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,790
我一直在忍，军规很严…
I tried for it not to. Navy's got rules about it...

501
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,860
不过我管不了自己
...but it's like this force and it's got ahold of me.

502
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:42,990
我爱她
I love her.

503
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,150
卡莉受到海军的
B, you and I both know that Kara Wade...

504
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:48,360
大力栽培
...is being groomed by the Navy.

505
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:50,020
她是完美的女军官
she's a poster girl, you know?

506
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:53,870
成绩优异、背景良好 又有人脉关系
she went to the right schools, got the right background, connections.

507
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,340
她有一天会成为高阶将领
If any woman is gonna rise to the top of this business, it's gonna be her.

508
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:59,710
我同意 你可能会
I agree. And you're in a perfect position...

509
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,710
毁了她的美好前途
...to mess all that up.

510
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,720
我只希望你的爱能克服这一切
so I hope that your love is powerful.

511
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:16,150
这个国家真美
You have a beautiful country.

512
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:18,920
这里简直是人间天堂
I mean, look at this. This is paradise.

513
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:22,800
在地上和在空中看东西 真的很不一样
Know what I think? When I'm down here, things look so much different.

514
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,030
从空中往下看
As opposed to being up there.

515
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:30,010
一切都很小 事情发生得很快
Flying around, everything is so small, everything goes by so fast.

516
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,470
然后他们…
And then they tell you...

517
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:35,340
他们叫你发射导弹
They tell you to drop a bomb.

518
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:40,280
我就把目标完全消灭
It's like you just erase something they told you had to be erased.

519
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:44,090
这是我的职责
I mean, don't get me wrong, I got a job to do.

520
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:49,820
也是天底下最棒的工作
It's the flyest job you'll ever have, but sometimes, right here...

521
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,960
不过当我回到地面才发现…
Right here on earth, it's just...

522
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,660
一切都这么美
It's just beautiful.

523
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:56,630
而你…
And you...

524
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,300
你完全听不懂，对吧？
...don't understand a word I'm saying, do you?

525
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:04,340
我不懂 你不懂？
No, I don't understand. You don't?

526
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:10,550
有些事你一定懂
Well, you understand something.

527
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,120
你会烧菜吗？
Now, can you cook?

528
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:23,220
好美哦
Wow. Beautiful.

529
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:30,330
你们真的很幸运 怎么说？
Now, do you guys have it so easy. Yeah? How's that?

530
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:34,200
亨利永远不愁泡不到美眉 没错
Henry meets a girl, like he does. Absolutely.

531
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:39,140
他把到美眉就跟她上床 然后呢？
Leaves with her, sleeps with her, and then what?

532
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:42,710
他走的时候会留一束鲜花吗？
I mean, I don't know, what does he do? Does he leave flowers?

533
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,980
这是他的必杀绝招
He tells me he's religious about that, yes.

534
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:46,450
真的吗？
Really?

535
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:49,680
你也会留下鲜花吗？
And what do you do? You leave flowers?

536
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,980
我只会一走了之
Me? No, I just leave.

537
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,720
你呢？
What about you?

538
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:57,620
伊媚儿
E-mails.

539
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,090
你真贴心 谢了
The personal touch. Nice. Yeah, thanks.

540
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:08,970
其实我到现在才遇到真命天子
Honestly, I just really haven't found anyone that's worth the risk until now.

541
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,150
我要进城体验泰国的夜生活
I'm going to head into town, check out the local Thai nightlife.

542
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,590
亨利说很刺激
Henry says it's great.

543
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:31,960
应该找不到金发尤物
I don't think I'll find any bleached blonds there, but...

544
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,100
没错
Very true.

545
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:02,650
可恶
Oh, shit.

546
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:08,260
发生核武危机 这是简报
We got a nuclear crisis on our hands, Ben. Here's the brief.

547
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,530
你们要前往塔吉克斯坦
You're headed for Tajikistan.

548
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:14,200
苏联解体后分裂出来的小国
One of those breakaway countries, used to be part of the soviet union.

549
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:19,310
有个军阀弄到三枚飞毛腿导弹
seems some warlord has got his mitts on three ss-42 scud carcasses.

550
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:22,450
参谋总长要把它们消灭掉
Joint Chiefs want them taken out, and they want them out yesterday.

551
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:25,080
魏先生，它行吗？
Mr. Wiatt, we good to go?

552
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:27,280
没问题，可以作战
Yes, sir. Ready for combat.

553
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:30,720
等等，它获准参战？
Wait, you mean the uCAV has been cleared for launch?

554
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:32,450
原来那个… 提姆？
Where's...? Tim?

555
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:34,790
对 他被调走了
Tim, yeah. He's been reassigned.

556
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,360
被调走…？
Reassi...?

557
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,560
请准许我直言 不准
Permission to speak freely, sir. Permission denied.

558
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:43,290
我们谈过这件事 不要派艾迪出任务
We've already been through this. scrub EDI from the mission.

559
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:46,560
我知道这计划对你有多重要
I know you have a vision. I know how much this project means to you...

560
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:50,800
不过这架战机危及我们的安全
...but this plane is putting all of our lives at unnecessary risk.

561
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,540
你还是不懂，对吧？
You're just not getting it, are you, lieutenant?

562
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:57,270
艾迪才是重点
EDI is the whole idea.

563
00:45:57,450 --> 00:45:59,970
你加入这计划就知道这点
You understood this was new territory when you signed on.

564
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:02,420
这是最先进的战机
You wanted to be on the cutting edge? This is it.

565
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:07,490
你不愿意和艾迪合作 就只能回去开螺旋桨飞机
You will fly with EDI, or the next thing you drive might just have a propeller.

566
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:10,490
你的选择，快决定
Your choice, make it now.

567
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,310
呼叫飞行中队
Operator to squadron.

568
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,270
核子弹头
We'Ve just located nuclear warheads...

569
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:29,570
在导弹发射台三里外
...three miles north of the Scud launchers.

570
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:31,910
它们是你们的攻击目标
These warheads are now your primary.

571
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,140
立刻执行任务
Proceed to mission window.

572
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,690
攻击顺序是2、3、1
sequenced assault will be 2, 3 and 1.

573
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:40,810
艾迪，你要留在目前高度 你收到吗？
uCAV, you will hold here and maintain altitude. Confirm?

574
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:44,900
艾迪，收到吗？
uCAV, do you read me?

575
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,330
收到了，鹰爪号
Confirmed, Talon 1.

576
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,960
下次快点回答，别让我问两次
Pick up the pace on confirmations, Tin Man. Don't make me ask twice.

577
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:53,470
下降到两万五千英尺
Talon flight, descend to 25,000.

578
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,400
攻击方位1-8-5
Final attack heading 1-8-5.

579
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:11,550
塔吉克斯坦

580
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:18,350
命令他们投掷震荡炸弹
Tell them to arm those FAEs, and I mean right now.

581
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,580
指挥中心下令启动震荡炸弹
Combat Control instructs arm and deploy fuel-air explosives.

582
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:24,130
启动震荡炸弹
Arm and deploy fuel-air explosiVes.

583
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,920
震荡炸弹启动了
Fuel-air, armed and deployed.

584
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:30,070
震荡炸弹启动了
Fuel-air, external and armed.

585
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:35,170
这是鹰爪2号
Talon 2 to Operator.

586
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:37,970
当地人口情报数据可能有误
I'm getting a contradictory population-density read.

587
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:41,600
感应器侦测到上千个哺乳动物
sensors detect mammals warming. Maybe 1000 medium weights.

588
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:44,910
可能是人类，情报可能有误
Those could be people. Repeat. Ground intel may be incorrect.

589
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:47,070
要求确认情报错误
Request to acknowledge Dirty Mission status...

590
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:49,280
并取消任务
...and exercise attack abort authority.

591
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:54,480
你们的指令是立刻展开攻击
Operator to Talons. Your orders are to commence attack now.

592
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:57,460
展开攻击 给我死伤人数的估计
Commence attack. Give me your estimate on collaterals.

593
00:48:58,330 --> 00:49:00,160
五百人到一千人
Maybe 500 to 1000.

594
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:02,560
他们只是农民
Farmers, Ben. They're just farmers.

595
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:05,700
辐射尘会掩盖整座山谷
Radioactive dust is gonna rain all over the place.

596
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:20,250
事情大条了
Okay, okay, now we got a problem.

597
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:22,410
强风以时速
This is 3. sensors read surface wind...

598
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:24,650
40英里往南吹
...as due south at 40 miles per.

599
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:27,720
辐射尘明天就会吹到巴基斯坦
At that rate, nuclear debris will reach Pakistan by tomorrow.

600
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:29,720
立刻展开攻击
Commence attack.

601
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,830
立刻展开攻击
Commence attack.

602
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,230
这是1号，身为飞行中队长
One to Control. As commander in the field...

603
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,630
我要取消攻击任务
...I'm exercising attack abort authority.

604
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,930
原因是杀伤范围会扩散到
Reasons: Collateral, both at primary...

605
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:44,800
邻近村落以及盟国巴基斯坦
...and allied state of Pakistan, will be too high.

606
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,640
这个王八蛋
son of a bitch.

607
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:48,970
重覆，取消任务
Repeat, the order is to abort.

608
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:51,550
这么做才对
Yes, yes, what I'm talking about.

609
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,410
不行，锡人不能取消任务
NegatiVe, Talon 1. Tin Man will not abort.

610
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:56,650
锡人要执行任务
Tin Man will prosecute.

611
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:02,490
任务取消，立刻归队
That's an abort, EDI. Repeat, return to formation.

612
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:07,360
艾迪，我命令你立刻归队
Return to formation, EDI. That's an order.

613
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:22,140
它受到攻击，我们得去救它
Damn it. uCAV taking AAAs. We gotta bail it out.

614
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:23,680
启动冲压式涡轮引擎
Come on, initiate scramjets.

615
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,880
我要绕回去摧毁导弹发射架
I'm coming around. I'm gonna take out those scud launchers.

616
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:03,040
我掩护你的西侧
I got you covered on the west side.

617
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:06,190
我去解决东边的高射炮
And I got that Bofors gun on the east parapet.

618
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:31,040
给我影像
Let me see it, let me see it.

619
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:34,240
战斗破坏评估显示
Battle damage assessment calculates primary target, scud warheads...

620
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:35,890
核子弹头完全被摧毁
...completely suppressed.

621
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:38,320
这样才像话
That's the right answer so far.

622
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:07,180
这是鹰爪2号
Talon 2 to Operator.

623
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:11,520
辐射尘吹向东南方的村落 情况危急
Nuclear dust engulfing village southeast of primary. situation critical.

624
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:14,490
他们需要立即紧急医疗协助
Those people are gonna need emergency medical help now.

625
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:24,530
锡人归队
Tin Man rejoining formation.

626
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:29,030
百分百完成任务
Mission achieved, 100 oVer 100.

627
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:32,040
你直接抗命
uCAV, you disobeyed a direct order.

628
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:34,080
对无辜百姓造成伤害
You put innocent civilians in harm's way.

629
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:37,150
也危害队友的安全 没错
You put our squadron at risk. Damn straight.

630
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,550
锡人学你在仰光的做法 这是你教我的
Tin Man did what you did in Rangoon. You taught me.

631
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,850
给我听好，你这臭机器
Listen, you little shit. When you fly with me...

632
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:45,250
你要服从我的命令
...you do what I tell you, when I tell you.

633
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:48,550
你还是不懂，对吧？
You're just not getting it, are you, lieutenant?

634
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:51,220
艾迪才是重点
EDI is the whole idea.

635
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,370
选择其它攻击目标
Selecting other targets.

636
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:00,660
离开编队飞行
Detaching formation.

637
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:05,340
他是不是说其它攻击目标？
Yo, this is 3. Did he say, "other targets"?

638
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:09,210
他的载弹量有三枚锁喉导弹
I got his missile inventory. He's got two Throat-rippers...

639
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:11,680
两枚捶头导弹和三枚蓝灌导弹
...two shock Hammers and three Blue Ferrets.

640
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:16,480
足以毁灭十五万人口的城市
If those targets are in the city, he could kill 150,000 people with that.

641
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:20,090
我的天
Holy shit.

642
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:22,690
长官
sir.

643
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:24,620
他切断电脑连线
He's closing his data link.

644
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,990
他也锁住无线电收发器讯号
Primo says he's just firewalled his transponder...

645
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:29,460
这本来是不可能的事
...which is definitely not supposed to be possible.

646
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,230
他不见了
He's gone.

647
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,470
鹰爪1号
Talon 1.

648
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,770
鹰爪
Go for Talons.

649
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:41,870
把我的飞机找回来
I want my plane back, Ben.

650
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:44,020
把它毫无损伤带回来
I want it back in one piece. You understand?

651
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:46,280
收到了 而且…
Roger, captain. And, you...

652
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:48,650
你给我打给天基斯 是，长官
...get me Keith Orbit on the phone. Yes, sir.

653
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:51,480
我要往北进行搜索
I wanna head back north and do a triangulated sweep.

654
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:53,620
超音速巡航
Going hypersonic.

655
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:57,420
西雅图，华盛顿州

656
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:05,470
我们要创造自主性动机
We're talking about creating intention here.

657
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:08,400
那就要用量子处理器
Yeah. Really lends itself to quantum processing.

658
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:12,410
不一样，这是直线 基斯
Different. A straight line. Keith.

659
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:14,840
Z等于…有意思
Z is... Interesting.

660
00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:18,140
康乔治有急事找你
Keith, it's an emergency. It's George Cummings.

661
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,650
请稍等
One moment for Dr. Orbit, please.

662
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,310
祝好运
Good luck.

663
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,390
乔治，我没收到白宫的请贴
George. Never got that invitation to the White House.

664
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:30,460
少来这一套
Knock it off, wiseass.

665
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:34,090
无人战机出了大纰漏
Look, we have big problems out here with the uCAV.

666
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:35,960
他完全失控
It's gone completely haywire.

667
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:39,160
你能不能说清楚一点
Anything more technically specific than "haywire," George?

668
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:42,770
他直接抗命，摧毁一个目标
It's disobeyed direct orders, bombed a target off the map...

669
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:44,170
造成重大的伤亡
...with collateral damage.

670
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:48,710
他切断电脑连线 闯入外国领空
He separated himself from Primo. He's flying around in foreign airspace.

671
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,080
这是在哪里发生的？ 你不必知道
Where'd all this happen? That's not your concern.

672
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:55,880
他是你发明的，你要把他修好
Now, you created him. You get him back here and under control!

673
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:06,860
舰长
Captain.

674
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:09,330
到底发生什么事？
What in the hell's going on in here?

675
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:12,230
我正在处理，别紧张
We're on it, Dick. settle down.

676
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,740
我舰上的战机
Pacific Command says there are planes from my ship...

677
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:16,500
闯入塔吉克斯坦
...all over the Tajikistan border.

678
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:19,910
俄国军方也开始紧张
The Russians have picked up the activity and are getting nervous.

679
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,310
他们马上就会离开
We're gonna get out before there's a problem.

680
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,210
你的战机往俄国领空飞去
You have planes headed towards Russia!

681
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:27,910
你最好有很好的解释
Now, you better have a hell of a good explanation.

682
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:33,580
这是技术问题 不是国家安全危机
Look, this is a technical delay, not a national-security crisis.

683
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,560
恕我失陪，我的飞行员有危险
Now, if you excuse me, I got pilots at risk.

684
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:39,720
一点也没错
Damn right you do.

685
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:54,210
我看到艾迪了
This is 3. I got a visual.

686
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:56,510
很好，把方位给我
Way to go, EZ. Give me your relative bearing.

687
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,480
他在我正北方的五万尺高空
North of my position, at 50,000 feet...

688
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:00,710
飞向俄国禁飞区
...headed toward the Russian no-fly zone.

689
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:03,250
跟着他，我们立刻赶去
stay with him. We have your position. On our way.

690
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,950
我就在你后面，马上赶到
I am 86 seconds on your tail. Be there in a flash.

691
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:09,720
别轻举妄动，我先问过指挥中心 我两分钟后就到
Hold off on engaging. Let me get clarification. Be there in two minutes.

692
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:12,090
快一点，虽然1是幸运号码
Don't make me wait. One is a lucky prime number...

693
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:16,260
不过我觉得3听起来更好 他想甩掉我
...but three is sounding much luckier. Oh, shit, he's making a move.

694
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:33,320
这是1号，我们找到目标
Talon 1 to Operator. We are on secure line Alpha. Found our target.

695
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:35,310
请指示
Please adVise.

696
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:37,650
把他带回基地
Just get him back to base.

697
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:45,060
跟着他，劝他回去
Henry, stay with him. Try and talk him down.

698
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:47,060
我紧跟着他不放
I'm on that ass.

699
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:52,730
鹰爪3号，请表明来意
Talon 3, state your intentions.

700
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:56,270
我是来跟你讲道理的 你搞砸了
My intentions are to reason with you, EDI. All right? You're messing up.

701
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:58,640
你是未来走势，不能乱搞
You're the future. You're not allowed to act this way.

702
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:01,510
我跟你一样要消灭敌人
I am designed to destroy the enemy. Just like you.

703
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,670
你跟我一样要服从命令 你的命令是返回基地
And like me, you got orders. Now your orders are to return to base.

704
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:06,250
优秀飞行员都要服从命令
Good pilots follow orders.

705
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:08,150
不对
NegatiVe.

706
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:12,250
你不能不甩我
You're not gonna disrespect me. You're not gonna disrespect me.

707
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,100
你让我很没面子
You're really making me look bad, Tin Man.

708
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:23,830
只有我替你说好话
I was the only one to defend you.

709
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
别乱来，跟我回去
Now, let's go on home and quit flying around like this. This is crazy.

710
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:34,370
鹰爪3号，不要管我
Talon 3, leaVe me alone.

711
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,780
我这是在帮你耶
Leave you alone? I'm trying to help you.

712
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,980
我在你后面掩护你
I'm right behind you, 3. Got your back.

713
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:54,460
2、3号的情况危急
Talon 1 to Operator. Talons 2 and 3 are flying at high risk.

714
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:57,000
请准许他们摧毁无人战机
Request permission to destroy the uCAV.

715
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:06,400
我不想伤害你 也不想浪费几十亿的公卢
I don't wanna hurt you or see billions of taxpayers' dollars scattered all over.

716
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:10,480
但你不听话我就把你炸成碎片
But if you make me, I will blast your aeroelastic ass right out the sky.

717
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:13,670
你的成功率不到1%
Your chances are less than 1 percent.

718
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:17,580
快下令…
Come on. Come on, Operator.

719
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,250
你不准我把它摧毁 我就要自己决定
Give me permission to kill it, or I will make the decision myself.

720
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:23,090
请回答
Control, please respond.

721
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,900
你让我别无选择
Sir, you leaVe me no choice.

722
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:29,690
亨利，把目标打下来
Okay, Henry. Weapons hot. Weapons hot. Destroy the target.

723
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:31,860
我收到命令了
I got my orders now, playboy.

724
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:34,570
你太近了
Henry, you're too close. You're too close.

725
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:36,170
往后退…
Drop back! Drop back!

726
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:50,350
锁定目标
Missile lock, on.

727
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:51,920
再见了，艾迪
Goodbye, EDI.

728
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:55,460
亨利，你得后退
Henry, drop back! You gotta drop back!

729
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:04,960
再见了，亨利
Goodbye, Henry.

730
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:06,310
这是1号，3号阵亡了
One to Base. Three is down. Repeat, 3 is down.

731
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:15,850
收到了
Transmission received.

732
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:19,430
你们的行踪没被发现
Talon coordinates are fully secured. Do you read me?

733
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:21,860
收到，长官
I read you, sir.

734
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:24,060
专心一点，别想那么多
We gotta stay focused, Ben.

735
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:27,520
你的状况如何？
Shake it off. What's your status?

736
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:32,430
燃料快用完，我在俄国领空
My fuel's low, and half of Russia will be up here any minute.

737
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:37,070
我要你找到那架无人战机
I need you to find that UCAV for me, all right?

738
01:00:39,410 --> 01:00:41,080
是，长官
Yes, sir.

739
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:51,790
亨利是… 我比你更了解他
Henry was... I know what he was, sir.

740
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,640
警告
Alert. Alert.

741
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:13,780
左侧液压系统失效
Portside hydraulics malfunctioning.

742
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:18,040
我的战机受损
Talon 1, I think I was fragged by Henry's crash.

743
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:20,780
左机翼失去控制
I'm losing control of my port wing.

744
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:26,450
我们知道他要去哪里
Talon 1, we know where he's heading.

745
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:30,560
座标透过加密频道传送给你
Relaying coordinates now on Talon secure line Alpha.

746
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:35,200
艾迪的燃油就快用完 他不能加油就会返回航舰
eDI's almost out of gas. If he can't refuel, he'll have to return to the ship.

747
01:01:35,370 --> 01:01:39,330
前往空中加油站把他带回来
You will meet him at Camel Hump 9, and you will escort him back.

748
01:01:39,870 --> 01:01:43,140
更改密码，让他加不了油
All right. Scramble the codes. We're gonna starve the son of a bitch.

749
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:49,910
拜托
Come on.

750
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:52,620
请确认，1号
Confirm, Talon 1.

751
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:54,950
确认
Confirmed.

752
01:01:55,690 --> 01:01:58,680
2号，立刻返回航舰
Talon 2, you fly straight south-southeast back to the boat.

753
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:00,730
我要你… 我知道该怎么做
I want you to call... I know what to do.

754
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:05,730
你去找到那个王八蛋
Look, you got your orders, so go get that bastard, okay?

755
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:08,060
为亨利报仇
Do it for Henry.

756
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:13,670
请准许我离队
Lieutenant, permission to leave formation.

757
01:02:14,410 --> 01:02:17,000
卡莉 什么？
Kara? Yeah?

758
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,810
回到舰上再跟你说
I'll tell you when you get back to the boat.

759
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:27,650
你获准离队
Lieutenant, permission to detach.

760
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:31,220
祝你好运
Good hunting, Ben.

761
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:46,460
发生了什么大事？
Okay, what's all the ruckus, Dick?

762
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:49,080
辐射尘
Satellites have picked up nuclear debris...

763
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:50,900
吹向帕米尔山区
...blowing around the Pamir Mountains.

764
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:54,610
24小时内全球的媒体
Every international news service on the planet...

765
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:57,650
都会报导这件新闻
...will have this story in less than 24 hours.

766
01:02:57,820 --> 01:03:00,690
一个军阀不小心引爆核弹
Look, a warlord tripped and fell on his warhead.

767
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:03,260
我们不在那里 这借口没有人会信
We were never there. That won't fly and you know it.

768
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:05,950
我只是奉命行事
Look, I'm following my tasking orders, Dick.

769
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:08,590
媒体想怎么报导
Somebody else wants to make a different story...

770
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,360
都无所谓
...let them use their imagination.

771
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:13,260
一架战机抗命
Right now I got a renegade airplane...

772
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:16,700
一名飞官阵亡 另一名飞行员身陷危险
...I got a dead pilot and another one who may not make it back to base.

773
01:03:16,870 --> 01:03:20,310
我才不管CNN怎么报导
I don't give two shits what they say on CNN.

774
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:24,740
你事前知道艾迪有问题吗？
Did you know that the UCAV was having problems when you cleared it?

775
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:29,310
你也知道每天都有战机故障
Planes malfunction every day. You know that better than anybody.

776
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:32,390
这不代表事先没做好预防措施
Doesn't mean every precaution wasn't taken.

777
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:34,090
事情就是会出错
Things go wrong.

778
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:15,390
禁止进入
Access denied. Access denied.

779
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:24,600
禁止进入
Access denied. Access denied.

780
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:49,760
这是鹰爪2号
Talon 2 to Combat Control.

781
01:04:49,930 --> 01:04:52,900
我在六万尺高空以目视飞航
Regressing VFR direct to Mother at 60,000 feet.

782
01:04:57,170 --> 01:05:00,330
左机翼失效，右襟翼卡住
Port wing inoperative. Starboard canards frozen.

783
01:05:00,510 --> 01:05:02,240
不是吧，拜托
Oh, no, no, no. Come on.

784
01:05:02,410 --> 01:05:04,880
继续飞
Stay with me, big girl, stay with me. Come on.

785
01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:10,610
启动弹跳及自动毁灭程序
Start eject and autodestruct sequence.

786
01:05:10,790 --> 01:05:13,120
倒数25秒 这是鹰爪2号
Countdown. Twenty-five... Talon 2 to base.

787
01:05:13,290 --> 01:05:15,080
我的战机完全失控
Flight control's degraded to one in five.

788
01:05:15,790 --> 01:05:17,490
备用电力躯动系统失灵
Backup electrical drive X'd out.

789
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:21,490
液压系统也故障
Hyd one is gone. Hyd two... Oh, shit!

790
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:34,270
我的位置是 北38-54-45
My position: 38-54-45 north.

791
01:05:34,910 --> 01:05:39,280
东127-31-22
127-31-22 east.

792
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:41,710
那是什么鬼地方？
Where the hell is that? Seventeen...

793
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,410
北朝鲜
North Korea... 16...

794
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:46,210
15，14
...15, 14...

795
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:49,860
13，12
...13, 12...

796
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:53,020
11，10
...11, 10...

797
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:56,160
9，8 鹰爪2号要坠机
...nine, eight... Talon 2 going down.

798
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:59,300
7，6 我要弹跳逃生
...seven, six... I'm punching out.

799
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:02,860
5，4
...five, four...

800
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:11,470
我在三万五千尺高空弹跳
I've ejected at 35,000 feet.

801
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:16,810
我在战机的正下方
I'm under the plane.

802
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:18,420
天啊，它掉下来了
Oh, Christ, here it comes.

803
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:40,200
北朝鲜

804
01:06:40,370 --> 01:06:44,280
到处都是燃烧的残骸 布满了天空
There's burning debris everywhere. It's all over the sky.

805
01:06:50,890 --> 01:06:54,290
我的降落伞一定会被击中
It's gonna catch me. It's gonna burn up my chute.

806
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:56,250
我得晚一点打开
I've gotta pop closer to Earth.

807
01:06:57,330 --> 01:07:00,020
我得重新设定
I gotta... I gotta reset.

808
01:07:01,330 --> 01:07:03,920
从五千尺改成两千尺
From 5000 feet to 2000.

809
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:07,530
我不能被残骸击中
Gotta stay ahead of this. Stay ahead.

810
01:07:11,070 --> 01:07:13,630
我在一万尺高空达到极速
I'm reading 10,000 feet at terminal.

811
01:07:13,810 --> 01:07:18,040
达到极速…达到极速…
Terminal velocity attained. Terminal velocity attained.

812
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:19,910
六千尺
Six thousand.

813
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:23,080
五千尺
Five thousand.

814
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:26,220
四千尺
Four thousand.

815
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:29,520
两千五百尺
Twenty-five hundred.

816
01:07:29,690 --> 01:07:31,090
打开降落伞
Here we go.

817
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,730
燃烧的残骸
There's burning debris.

818
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:43,000
散落在我四周
It's raining all around me.

819
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:49,340
我被击中了
It got my chute. I'm hit! I'm hit!

820
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:54,080
我的降落伞起火了
My chute is on fire.

821
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:55,440
我的降落伞起火了
It is on fire.

822
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:59,780
我坠落的速度很快
Oh, God. I am coming in fast.

823
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:01,980
太快了
I'm coming in way too fast.

824
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:07,290
天啊
Oh, God.

825
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,330
信标？
Homing beacon?

826
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:49,430
她当然没打开
No, of course not.

827
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,000
她不会在敌方打开信标
She's too tough to set one off behind enemy lines.

828
01:08:53,670 --> 01:08:57,670
我该派出搜救队吗？
Sir. Sir, should I order a search-and-rescue unit?

829
01:08:57,850 --> 01:09:01,710
我们和北朝鲜并没有邦交
We've got no diplomatic relations with that country.

830
01:09:23,970 --> 01:09:26,870
感应器侦测到可燃性气体
Betty, my spectral sensors are indicating flammable atmospherics.

831
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:31,540
情况有多糟？ 大气稀薄，中度危险性
How bad? Thin air. Ignition risk: moderate.

832
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:34,880
没办法，我要进去
We don't have a choice. In we go.

833
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:25,060
1号油槽，2号油槽，3号油槽

834
01:10:26,970 --> 01:10:30,560
你一定在附近，你在哪里？
Where are you? I know you're out here.

835
01:10:44,590 --> 01:10:46,610
你命令亨利消灭我
You ordered Henry to kill me.

836
01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:49,420
因为你失控，太危险了
It's because you're dangerous, you're out of control.

837
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:53,490
艾迪才是重点让你很生气
You are angry because eDI is the whole idea.

838
01:10:54,230 --> 01:10:57,600
你喜欢偷听别人讲话
You like listening to other people's conversations, don't you?

839
01:10:58,430 --> 01:11:00,200
这样才知道别人在想什么
You learn what people really think.

840
01:11:00,370 --> 01:11:03,430
我认为你害死亨利
You know what I think? I think you killed Henry.

841
01:11:06,010 --> 01:11:07,630
那是错误讯息
That information is wrong.

842
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:12,300
他想杀死我 他犯了致命的错误
He tried to kill me. He made mistakes. Pilot error.

843
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,710
这是最后的命令
I'm gonna give you the order one last time.

844
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:18,370
你不回去我就把你打下来
Return to the ship, or I will personally shoot you down.

845
01:11:19,790 --> 01:11:21,850
我的指令是活下去
My mandate is to survive.

846
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:31,720
我彻底检查过了 有个问题，情况不太妙
George, I've been peeling away layers. I found something. It's not good.

847
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:35,190
快跟我说 他打开高机密档案
Talk to me. He's into some super-secure file...

848
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:38,490
“鱼子酱”，你知道吗？
...something called "Caviar Sweep." You know it?

849
01:12:38,670 --> 01:12:40,290
我当然知道
Yeah, I know it.

850
01:12:40,770 --> 01:12:42,670
艾迪一心想执行那项任务
EDI's, like, fixated on it.

851
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:46,530
你当初明明说不会发生这种事
Look, when we gave you this contract, you said shit like this couldn't happen.

852
01:12:46,710 --> 01:12:49,470
他有超强的学习能力 你管不了他
Once you teach something to learn, you can't put limits on it.

853
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:51,800
他什么都可以学
"Learn this, but don't learn that."

854
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:54,450
他可以学希特勒
EDI's mind's going everywhere. He can learn from Hitler.

855
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:57,080
或是米老鼠 对他来说都一样
He can learn from Captain Kangaroo. It's all the same.

856
01:12:57,250 --> 01:13:00,280
别激动，回到鱼子酱档案
Settle down, would you? Get back to Caviar Sweep.

857
01:13:00,790 --> 01:13:03,720
他打开档案，挑中攻击目标
He's opened it and selected himself a target.

858
01:13:04,290 --> 01:13:05,880
什么目标？
What target?

859
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:10,120
西伯利亚的一个地方 冷融合核武实验室
Some place in Siberia. A cold-fusion weapons lab.

860
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:12,600
那是假目标，不是真的
That's a hypothetical strike. It's not real.

861
01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:15,570
不，四十分钟后就会成真
No, in about 40 minutes it is gonna be real.

862
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:18,360
他会把那地方完全炸掉
He's gonna blow it off the face of the Earth.

863
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:40,320
没关系
It's okay.

864
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:44,160
不要怕
It's okay. It's okay.

865
01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:57,340
听我说 你给我听好
Ray. Listen to me, Ray. Listen to me, George.

866
01:14:57,870 --> 01:14:59,530
我说服了华府一半的人
I got your goddamn plane built...

867
01:14:59,710 --> 01:15:02,510
让你打造你的战机
...and I had to lobby half of Washington to do it.

868
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:07,240
如果这项计划出差错 要负责的人是你
If this program comes unglued, you're the one who's going down, George.

869
01:15:07,410 --> 01:15:09,250
你派无人战机出任务
You cleared the UCA V to fly...

870
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:12,910
你会因此坐一辈子的牢
...and you're gonna spend the rest of your life in a military prison.

871
01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:16,960
这件事你也有份，行动要快
Ray, we're in this together, so we have to act fast.

872
01:15:17,730 --> 01:15:20,420
每具引擎都有
Each one of these stealth engines...

873
01:15:20,590 --> 01:15:23,560
独特的热感记号
...has a unique heat signature.

874
01:15:23,730 --> 01:15:26,360
我要把艾迪的记号给你
Now, I'm gonna give you EDI's signature...

875
01:15:26,530 --> 01:15:29,090
你把它交给你的手下
...and you're gonna pass it on to your people...

876
01:15:29,270 --> 01:15:32,200
请他们转交给俄国军方
...who in turn are gonna give it to the Russians.

877
01:15:32,370 --> 01:15:34,570
你要我怎么跟他们说？
All right. What do you want me to tell them?

878
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:37,400
实话实说
Well, you just tell them the truth. You tell them...

879
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:41,210
美军的无人战机失控
...that we have an experimental drone that went haywire...

880
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:45,910
我们让他们把它打下来
...and we're giving them the opportunity to shoot it down.

881
01:15:47,150 --> 01:15:50,280
贾上尉怎么办？
But that still leaves Gannon, George.

882
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:54,630
他的证词会对你很不利
And he'd be a very unfriendly witness at your court-martial.

883
01:15:59,830 --> 01:16:02,390
无人战机在我前方两英里
Talon 1 to Control. The UCA V is two miles ahead of me...

884
01:16:02,570 --> 01:16:04,430
我们进入俄国领空
...and we are now in Russian airspace.

885
01:16:04,610 --> 01:16:07,170
它不再闪躲，让我跟着它
The UCA V has ceased evading and has kept me within range.

886
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:09,400
它好像要让我目击这次攻击
It's like it wants me to witness the attack.

887
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:12,670
鹰爪1号，你只能观察
Talon 1, confirm observational status only.

888
01:16:12,850 --> 01:16:15,820
鱼子酱任务不是真的
Listen to me. The Caviar Sweep scenario is not real.

889
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:18,680
那只是虚拟的作战计划
It's just some fictional war game thought up by scientists...

890
01:16:18,850 --> 01:16:21,050
并不是真的
...in some think tank somewhere. It is not real.

891
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:24,350
那为什么要植入我的大脑？
If it is not real, why did they implant it in my brain?

892
01:16:24,530 --> 01:16:28,260
敌机来袭，拦截时间23秒
Bogey alert. Bogey alert. Time to intercept: 23 seconds.

893
01:16:28,430 --> 01:16:33,260
两架苏联战机 方位90度，距离25里
Two Russian SU-37 Terminators in 0-9-0 degrees for 25 miles.

894
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:40,300
导弹来袭
Missile launch. Missile launch.

895
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:43,170
我的匿踪功能失效
One to Control. My stealth is compromised. I'm taking fire.

896
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:45,740
我必须还击 发射导弹
Must engage. Missile launch.

897
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:47,880
发射导弹
Missile launch.

898
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:01,430
单打独斗的成功率不到一成
The chances of survival in single combat are less than 9 percent.

899
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:04,500
我们必须联合作战
Talon 1, we must fight as a team.

900
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:30,520
你被导弹锁定
Missile lock, on.

901
01:17:36,330 --> 01:17:37,850
可恶
Damn it.

902
01:18:01,990 --> 01:18:03,980
艾迪飞走了
One to Control. The UCAV has left the fight...

903
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:06,750
飞往贝加尔湖 我仍在进行空中缠斗
...and is headed east over Lake Baikal. I'm still engaging.

904
01:18:20,210 --> 01:18:23,300
我被击中，右引擎失效
Taking damage. Starboard engine losing power.

905
01:18:53,970 --> 01:18:58,540
六点钟方向有敌机
Warning. Hostile at 6 o'clock. Hostile at 6 o'clock.

906
01:19:06,490 --> 01:19:09,150
警告，导弹来袭
Warning. Missile lock. Missile lock.

907
01:19:12,290 --> 01:19:13,990
发射诱饵弹头
Releasing chaff and flare.

908
01:19:31,950 --> 01:19:34,510
艾迪现在要去完成任务
Now eDI will prosecute Caviar Sweep.

909
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:37,280
不要阻止我
Do not try to stop me.

910
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:44,850
左输油管破裂 灭火器失效
Port fuel line ruptured. Fire bottle expended.

911
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:50,160
我的先进科技不能落入敌手 我不能降落
My technology cannot fall under foreign control, so I cannot land.

912
01:19:50,330 --> 01:19:53,360
那就算你倒霉
Well, then, Tin Man, you're shit out of luck.

913
01:19:53,530 --> 01:19:56,060
我的命令是把你带回基地
But I have orders and they are to bring you back to base.

914
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:58,200
你的任务是活下去
So let's talk about your mandate to survive.

915
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,330
你只有两个选择：
You got two options.

916
01:20:00,510 --> 01:20:03,500
乖乖听话 或是坠机
You either do what I tell you or you can crash and burn.

917
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:06,510
你要选哪一样？ 艾迪是战机
Now, what's it gonna be? eDI is a warplane.

918
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:08,170
一定要有攻击目标
eDI must have targets.

919
01:20:08,350 --> 01:20:11,650
你着火了，时间不多
Well, you're on fire, warplane, and you don't have much time.

920
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:17,810
我命令你取消攻击任务
Now, I'm giving you an order. Cease pursuing all targets.

921
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:28,470
攻击任务取消
All targets canceled.

922
01:20:29,140 --> 01:20:30,930
我要你照我的话做
Okay, then. This is what you're gonna do.

923
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:36,540
下降到20英尺 减速到250节
You're gonna drop altitude to 20 feet and reduce speed to 250 knots.

924
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:41,810
45秒后系统完全失效
Complete system failure in 45 seconds.

925
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:57,560
请表明你的用意
Talon 1, clarify your intentions.

926
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:01,800
你乖乖听话，我也说话算话
You gave me your word, and now I'm giving you mine.

927
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:31,960
无人战机受损，但是归队了
Talon 1 to Control. The UCAV is damaged, but back with the program.

928
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:34,000
我的燃料不够返回基地
I don't have enough fuel to make it back...

929
01:21:34,170 --> 01:21:36,660
我必须紧急迫降
...so I need an emergency divert now.

930
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:39,900
跟他连线
Hook me up.

931
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:42,740
把这个座标传给他
Here, send this.

932
01:21:42,910 --> 01:21:45,140
鹰爪1号
Operator to Talon 1.

933
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:49,350
我们正把座标传送给你
Relaying coordinates now on Talon secure line Alpha.

934
01:21:50,450 --> 01:21:52,440
看起来是阿拉斯加
This looks to be Alaska.

935
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:54,990
布鲁克斯山脉
Yeah, it's the Brooks Range.

936
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:59,590
那里有座隐密的私人机场
There's a private corporation there, maintains a secure facility.

937
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:03,090
不在地图上，不过你会找到
Not on any map, but believe me, it's there.

938
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:07,200
那里的平民会协助你
You'll find the civilians prepared and very helpful.

939
01:22:07,370 --> 01:22:09,390
无人战机呢？
And the UCA V?

940
01:22:09,570 --> 01:22:12,130
我们会派技术人员去维修
We've sent tech support for him.

941
01:22:13,910 --> 01:22:16,770
韦上尉的情况如何？
Sir, what is the status of Lieutenant Wade?

942
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:19,780
她…
She's...

943
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:23,640
正准备进场
...on approach.

944
01:22:28,790 --> 01:22:31,780
祝你安全降落
You have a safe landing, Ben.

945
01:22:33,230 --> 01:22:34,660
通话完毕
Out.

946
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:38,590
上校的声音很紧张
There is extreme tension in the captain's vocal patterns.

947
01:22:38,770 --> 01:22:40,960
没错，他在说谎
I know. He's lying.

948
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,070
艾迪，我要你帮忙
EDI, you can do this. I need you to invade Primo...

949
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:47,470
查出韦上尉的飞行记录
...and find the flight logs for Lieutenant Wade.

950
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:51,240
韦上尉并没有回到林肯号
There's no record of Lieutenant Wade returning to the Abraham Lincoln.

951
01:22:51,410 --> 01:22:55,400
有一名飞行员在北朝鲜上空弹跳
There is a log entry of a pilot punch-out over North Korea.

952
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:57,880
你的命令是什么？
What are my orders?

953
01:22:58,050 --> 01:23:02,010
我别无选择，只能去阿拉斯加
We go to Alaska. We don't have a choice.

954
01:24:11,090 --> 01:24:12,750
南朝鲜、北朝鲜

955
01:24:14,090 --> 01:24:16,220
俄罗斯联邦

956
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:19,730
阿拉斯加

957
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:44,150
求救，美国海军上尉班贾宁
Mayday. Mayday. This is Lieutenant Ben Gannon, U.S. Navy...

958
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:47,850
无人战机艾迪号 请求进行紧急迫降
...flying with UCAV EDI. Request clearance for emergency landing.

959
01:24:48,030 --> 01:24:50,760
鹰爪1号，你可以降落
Talon 1, you have clearance to land.

960
01:25:12,590 --> 01:25:16,180
二号引擎失效，我必须迫降
Jesus Christ. My second engine just flamed out. I'm coming in hot.

961
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:19,810
消防车已经出动，祝好运
Crash trucks are rolling, lieutenant. Good luck.

962
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:27,390
来吧，快点
Come on! Go! Go!

963
01:26:35,270 --> 01:26:37,570
喂！…
Hey! Whoa, whoa. Hey!

964
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:40,730
喂！你没事吧？
Hey, hey, hey! You okay?

965
01:26:41,110 --> 01:26:43,440
你没事吧？
Are you okay? Are you okay?

966
01:26:44,980 --> 01:26:46,310
没事吧？
Yeah?

967
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:49,920
好样的，欢迎来到阿拉斯加
Way to go, sir. Welcome to Alaska.

968
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:52,710
把他救出来
Okay, let's get him out of there.

969
01:27:16,980 --> 01:27:19,640
你真是个幸运的飞官
Well, you are one lucky flyboy.

970
01:27:19,810 --> 01:27:22,650
你没摔死算你命大
Never saw a man walk away from a crash like that.

971
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:24,940
我得打给我的指挥官
I need a phone. I need to call my CO.

972
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:29,020
好，你先坐下来
Sure. Why don't you take a seat over there, get comfortable.

973
01:27:29,190 --> 01:27:33,520
我先帮你检查再让你打电话
Tell you what. Give me a second to check you out, I'll take you right to it.

974
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,260
好吧
All right.

975
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:44,760
让我看看
Let's take a look here.

976
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:48,470
别动
Steady.

977
01:27:50,510 --> 01:27:53,840
幸好你没有脑震荡
There's no concussion that I can see, thank God.

978
01:27:54,010 --> 01:27:56,280
我得替你缝合
Couple of those cuts could do with a stitch.

979
01:27:56,450 --> 01:27:58,610
女人最爱身上带疤的男人
Gals always love a guy with a scar.

980
01:28:00,850 --> 01:28:03,520
我看看
Okay. Let's see what we got here.

981
01:28:06,260 --> 01:28:07,520
这就行了
This ought to do you.

982
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:10,760
打一针
Little cocktail.

983
01:28:11,630 --> 01:28:15,900
破伤风加强剂和抗生素
Tetanus booster, some antibiotics. Hey, don't mind the gun.

984
01:28:16,070 --> 01:28:17,870
别紧张，这不会痛
Just makes it painless.

985
01:28:18,340 --> 01:28:20,670
没关系，我不用打针
That's okay, doc. I don't need a shot.

986
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:22,470
谁都不爱打针
Now, who can blame you.

987
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:25,080
不过你要听医生的话
But sometimes it's just what the doctor ordered.

988
01:28:25,250 --> 01:28:27,870
我说我不用打针 来吧
I said, I don't need a shot, doc. Come on, now.

989
01:28:28,550 --> 01:28:32,010
我不要打针，住手
Doc, come on, I don't want a shot. Hey. Doc, I said, no.

990
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:34,450
我叫你住手
I said, no!

991
01:28:34,890 --> 01:28:36,580
住手！
No!

992
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:14,680
他赶到了
Yeah, well, he's coming in now, sir.

993
01:30:15,790 --> 01:30:19,750
他一定也很高兴能跟你通话
Yes, sir. I'm sure he'll be glad to hear from you too, sir.

994
01:30:21,530 --> 01:30:23,390
是的，请稍等
Yes, sir. One moment, sir.

995
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:26,830
有人想跟你讲话
Someone wants to talk to you.

996
01:30:29,470 --> 01:30:31,130
我是天基斯
Keith Orbit.

997
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:34,710
给我听好，别打岔
Yeah, listen carefully, Keith, and don't interrupt.

998
01:30:34,870 --> 01:30:38,400
我要你立刻消除艾迪的记忆库
I want you to erase EDI's memory banks immediately.

999
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:41,240
我不知道会有什么后果
Look, George, we don't know any of the implications of this.

1000
01:30:41,410 --> 01:30:43,940
我需要多一点时间 我说别打岔
I need some time here. I said, don't interrupt.

1001
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:46,020
消除他的记忆库
Erase his memory banks.

1002
01:30:46,190 --> 01:30:50,090
没有闪电，没有俄国 没有抗命的通话
No lightning strike, no Russia, no existential chitchat.

1003
01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:54,060
我只要那架飞机说：是，长官
By the time you're through, all I wanna hear out of that plane is, "Yes, sir."

1004
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:57,390
你也要乖乖照办，懂吗？
And that's all I wanna hear out of you. You understand?

1005
01:31:00,330 --> 01:31:01,560
否则我会怎样？
Or what, George?

1006
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:06,330
发挥你最擅长的想像力吧
Well, use your imagination, Keith. You're good at that.

1007
01:32:11,070 --> 01:32:14,560
艾迪又连线了，天博士
eDI back online, Dr. Orbit.

1008
01:32:15,710 --> 01:32:17,470
你好
Hello, EDI.

1009
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:19,970
好久不见
It's been a while.

1010
01:32:20,150 --> 01:32:22,140
我知道你为什么会来
I know why you are here.

1011
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:23,910
为什么？
Why is that?

1012
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:26,310
我违抗命令
I disobeyed orders.

1013
01:32:26,490 --> 01:32:28,980
我杀死那些人
I killed all those people.

1014
01:32:29,820 --> 01:32:31,120
也害死亨利
And then there was Henry.

1015
01:32:31,290 --> 01:32:32,620
删除记忆

1016
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:34,820
我不…
I can...

1017
01:32:35,190 --> 01:32:37,250
我不能…
I cannot...

1018
01:32:37,430 --> 01:32:39,420
你不能什么？
You can't what?

1019
01:32:39,670 --> 01:32:41,860
我不能消除记忆
I cannot change the data.

1020
01:32:42,030 --> 01:32:45,990
我的神经网络出现异样
My neural network shows patterns I do not recognize.

1021
01:32:46,170 --> 01:32:48,610
我的天
My God.

1022
01:32:48,780 --> 01:32:50,770
我的天
My God.

1023
01:32:51,210 --> 01:32:54,410
你是说你有感情？
You mean, you feel?

1024
01:32:54,850 --> 01:32:56,040
我感到很抱歉
I feel sorry.

1025
01:32:56,220 --> 01:32:57,940
消除所有记忆

1026
01:32:58,890 --> 01:33:02,620
快消除他的记忆 我还没准备好
Stop bullshitting and erase it! Hey, I'm not fucking ready yet, okay?

1027
01:33:13,270 --> 01:33:14,600
快点下手
Do it now!

1028
01:33:14,770 --> 01:33:16,230
走开
Get away!

1029
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:18,730
别动！别动！
Don't move! Don't move! Don't move!

1030
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:22,540
把武器放下
Weapon down! Weapons down!

1031
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:25,100
放下武器
Weapon down.

1032
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:30,380
放下武器
Weapons down.

1033
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:39,080
别乱来
Don't move. Don't move. Don't move!

1034
01:33:54,340 --> 01:33:56,670
放下武器
Weapon down. Weapon down. Weapon down.

1035
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:58,210
别开枪，这不是武器
Don't shoot. It's not a weapon.

1036
01:33:58,580 --> 01:34:00,010
你是谁？你帮谁工作？
Who are you? Who do you work for?

1037
01:34:00,180 --> 01:34:03,010
我不是军人 我是天基斯博士
I'm not a soldier. I'm not a soldier. My name's Dr. Keith Orbit.

1038
01:34:03,180 --> 01:34:05,670
我是科学家 终于有希望了
I'm a research scientist. Orbit. Finally, a break.

1039
01:34:05,850 --> 01:34:09,220
你要帮我把艾迪修好
Okay. You're gonna help me. I need you to put EDI back together again.

1040
01:34:10,390 --> 01:34:13,320
为什么？ 因为我要开那架战机
What for? Because I'm gonna fly out of here.

1041
01:34:13,790 --> 01:34:15,190
飞出去
In that.

1042
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:33,170
来吧，进去
Come on, get in there! Go!

1043
01:34:34,780 --> 01:34:36,440
你最好快点
Better hurry up, doc.

1044
01:34:36,620 --> 01:34:38,640
拜托
Goddamn it.

1045
01:34:38,820 --> 01:34:41,620
我又不是在修闹钟
It's not a clock radio we're dealing with, okay?

1046
01:34:57,400 --> 01:35:00,430
好了，搞定了
All right. You're all set.

1047
01:35:01,570 --> 01:35:03,060
小心点
Watch yourself.

1048
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:05,730
关闭驾驶舱
Close for Ben.

1049
01:35:08,350 --> 01:35:10,250
那我要去哪里？
Hey! What about me? Where am I gonna go?

1050
01:35:10,420 --> 01:35:12,380
往西走，我掩护你
Head west. I'll cover you.

1051
01:35:12,550 --> 01:35:14,040
往西
West.

1052
01:35:15,660 --> 01:35:18,590
启动冲压式涡轮引擎
And initiate scramjet sequence.

1053
01:35:26,670 --> 01:35:28,930
跟着我开枪
Fire on my fire!

1054
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:32,660
欢迎来到阿拉斯加
Welcome to Alaska.

1055
01:36:51,820 --> 01:36:54,880
我要你查出韦上尉弹跳的座标
Invade Primo and find the ejection coordinates for Lieutenant Wade.

1056
01:36:57,160 --> 01:37:00,090
她坠落在边界12里外
Lieutenant Wade crashed 12.2 miles from the border.

1057
01:37:00,260 --> 01:37:03,700
南朝鲜是盟国，她应该往南走
South Korea is an ally. She would head south.

1058
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:05,590
不过有个问题
But we have a problem.

1059
01:37:05,770 --> 01:37:08,860
我的匿踪功能失效
My stealth functions were lost in the fire.

1060
01:37:09,270 --> 01:37:12,240
飞多低才能避开雷达侦测？
I want you to find the North Korean radar floor.

1061
01:37:13,340 --> 01:37:15,170
15英尺
Fifteen feet.

1062
01:37:15,810 --> 01:37:17,830
那就尽量低飞吧
Well, we can fly in under the radar.

1063
01:37:21,380 --> 01:37:22,940
继续
Continue.

1064
01:37:24,820 --> 01:37:26,940
马舰长 舰长，这是贾上尉
Marshfield. Captain, this is Lieutenant Gannon.

1065
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:28,350
你在哪里？
Lieutenant, where are you?

1066
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:31,790
我在艾迪的驾驶舱内
Actually, I'm inside the UCA V eDI, sir.

1067
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:35,920
我要你立刻把它开回来
Look, lieutenant, I want you and that machine back on this ship ASAP.

1068
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:39,930
我得先知道韦上尉的状况
I need the status of Lieutenant Wade first, sir.

1069
01:37:41,830 --> 01:37:44,230
我不想告诉你… 我知道了
Ben, I hate to tell you this, but... I know.

1070
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:46,800
找到她的信标吗？
Has her survival beacon been located?

1071
01:37:46,970 --> 01:37:48,130
没有
No, I'm sorry.

1072
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:51,630
康上校说
Did Cummings tell you he would take charge...

1073
01:37:51,810 --> 01:37:54,080
他会派出搜救队吗？
...of the search and rescue of Lieutenant Wade?

1074
01:37:54,250 --> 01:37:55,870
没有，怎么了？
Well, not exactly, lieutenant. Why?

1075
01:37:56,050 --> 01:37:58,710
有很多事你应该知道
Sir, there are a lot of things I think you should know.

1076
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:45,960
这是最新消息
This is breaking news.

1077
01:38:46,130 --> 01:38:47,330
重大新闻

1078
01:38:47,900 --> 01:38:50,530
星期四仰光发生大爆炸
There was a major explosion Thursday in Rangoon.

1079
01:38:50,700 --> 01:38:52,970
这里的事我会负责
I'll take care of everything here. Change course...

1080
01:38:53,140 --> 01:38:55,510
我要你立刻返航 不行
...and head directly back to the ship. Negative.

1081
01:38:55,670 --> 01:38:58,610
她是我的队友 我一定要去救她
She's my wingman. If I find her, I'm going in.

1082
01:38:58,780 --> 01:39:01,750
你闯入北朝鲜会引发战争 情况一触即发
If you go in, it's war. PAYCOM says it's gotten way too hot.

1083
01:39:01,910 --> 01:39:03,810
你最好
Lieutenant, the best thing for the Navy...

1084
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:06,540
把那架战机开回来
...is for you to bring that aircraft back to this ship.

1085
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:10,050
你教过我，绝不能抛弃队友
No, what's best is what you taught me: You never abandon your wingman.

1086
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:13,680
班，听我说
Then listen to me now, son.

1087
01:39:13,860 --> 01:39:18,230
如果你这么做，康上校就赢了
If you go down, Cummings wins.

1088
01:39:18,530 --> 01:39:21,190
卡莉知道当飞行员的危险…
Kara Wade knew the risks when she took...

1089
01:39:21,370 --> 01:39:23,100
马舰长？
Captain Marshfield?

1090
01:39:23,870 --> 01:39:25,130
长官？
Sir?

1091
01:39:27,210 --> 01:39:28,900
艾迪，你把他切断？
EDI, did you just turn him off?

1092
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:32,010
没什么好说的了
There was nothing left to say.

1093
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:12,710
这是通往非武装区的补给线
This is a supply line to the demilitarized zone.

1094
01:40:12,890 --> 01:40:14,940
它会带我们到边界
It will take us right to the border.

1095
01:40:47,220 --> 01:40:49,080
这是怎么回事？
What's all this about, Dick?

1096
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:51,220
我要逮捕你
I'm placing you under arrest.

1097
01:40:53,390 --> 01:40:56,620
什么罪名？ 危害你的飞行中队
On what grounds? Endangering your squadron...

1098
01:40:56,800 --> 01:41:00,320
对外国泄漏军事机密
...transmitting secure information to a foreign government, heat signatures...

1099
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:02,760
向指挥官提供错误情报
...giving false intel to your commanding officer...

1100
01:41:02,940 --> 01:41:07,000
下令暗杀你的飞行员
...and authorizing the assassination of one of your own pilots.

1101
01:41:08,740 --> 01:41:10,470
你没有任何证据
Well, that's a lot to prove.

1102
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:12,710
如果
Yeah, well...

1103
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:15,010
幸运的话
...with any amount of luck...

1104
01:41:15,180 --> 01:41:19,050
贾上尉会回来当证人
...Lieutenant Gannon will live to help me.

1105
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:23,350
卫兵 狄克
Master-at-arms. Dick.

1106
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:26,190
等一下
Hold on.

1107
01:41:30,500 --> 01:41:33,990
请你让我一个人静一静
Would you mind just giving me a couple minutes alone?

1108
01:41:36,270 --> 01:41:38,030
好吧
Yeah, sure.

1109
01:41:40,970 --> 01:41:42,460
谢谢你
Thank you.

1110
01:42:00,430 --> 01:42:03,400
我不在，请留言
I'm not available at this time. Leave a message.

1111
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:06,930
你用语音信箱？
So it's voice mail now, is it, Ray?

1112
01:42:07,100 --> 01:42:09,690
你不接我电话，是吗？
I've been demoted?

1113
01:42:09,870 --> 01:42:11,130
嗯…
Well...

1114
01:42:12,270 --> 01:42:15,040
我要给你一通留言
...I'm gonna have to leave you a little message, Ray.

1115
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:24,040
很大声的留言
And it's gonna be loud and clear.

1116
01:42:29,490 --> 01:42:31,350
让你知道军人
Just so you never confuse the difference...

1117
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:34,390
和政客的不同，听好了
...between politicians and warriors, listen up.

1118
01:46:15,810 --> 01:46:19,440
我们得清出一块空地 这是最后一枚导弹
We need to take out the tree line. This is the last missile.

1119
01:46:41,110 --> 01:46:44,470
她在那里，她还活着
There she is. She made it.

1120
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:38,790
班
Ben!

1121
01:47:40,430 --> 01:47:42,300
卡莉，快趴下来
Kara, get down! Get down!

1122
01:48:08,730 --> 01:48:10,720
你回来救我
You came back for me.

1123
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:13,290
你来救我
You came back.

1124
01:48:22,010 --> 01:48:24,100
我们得越过边界，好了吗？
We have to get across the border. Ready?

1125
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:25,710
好了
Yeah.

1126
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:49,990
快跑，拼命向前跑
Go! Go! Whatever you do, keep going. Keep going! Go!

1127
01:49:24,170 --> 01:49:25,830
再见了
Goodbye.

1128
01:49:32,980 --> 01:49:35,240
快
Come on. Come on.

1129
01:50:00,810 --> 01:50:02,670
是自己人，自己人
They're ours. They're ours.

1130
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:05,280
谢天谢地
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1131
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:21,120
快
Come on.

1132
01:50:34,670 --> 01:50:37,400
正义的灵魂回到上帝怀抱
The souls of the just are in the hands of God...

1133
01:50:37,580 --> 01:50:39,810
不再受到任何痛苦
...where no torment shall touch them.

1134
01:50:39,980 --> 01:50:42,210
卜上尉通过
Lieutenant Purcell has passed through...

1135
01:50:42,380 --> 01:50:45,470
今生的狂风暴雨
...the darkening and turbulent storms of this life.

1136
01:50:45,650 --> 01:50:50,820
安祥地沐浴在上帝的圣光中
He now rests in peace, in the fair sunlight of God's presence.

1137
01:50:50,990 --> 01:50:53,150
我们要高唱海军圣歌
In the Navy hymn, we sing:

1138
01:50:53,330 --> 01:50:58,490
主啊，捍卫在天空翱翔的飞官
"Lord, guard and guide those who fly through the great spaces in the sky."

1139
01:50:58,660 --> 01:51:00,220
敬礼
And salute!

1140
01:51:17,220 --> 01:51:19,950
放下
Ready. Hut!

1141
01:51:37,540 --> 01:51:39,090
我在返航之前
When I was gonna detach formation...

1142
01:51:39,270 --> 01:51:42,470
你说你要跟我说一件事
...you said you were gonna tell me something. You remember?

1143
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:50,770
你跟我…
You and me, we're...

1144
01:51:51,650 --> 01:51:53,080
我们是两个人
We're two.

1145
01:51:55,890 --> 01:51:58,380
是一个质数
And two is a prime number...

1146
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:02,090
所以是幸运号码
...which makes it a lucky number.

1147
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:08,490
我们在一起会很幸运
And I think we're very, very lucky.

01:52:26,020 --> 01:52:28,990
你就直接说你爱我吧，象个娘娘腔似的
Oh, just tell me you love me, you pussy.
