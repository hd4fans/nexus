(BELLS TOLLING)

2
00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:54.903
MRS. DE WINTER: Last night,I dreamt I went to Manderlay again.

3
00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:59.279
It seemed to me I stood by the iron gate leading to the drive,

4
00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:04.242
and for a while,I could not enter,for the way was barred to me.

5
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:06.782
Then,like all dreamers,

6
00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:10.957
I was possessed of a sudden with supernatural powers

7
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:14.623
and passed like a spirit through the barrier before me.

8
00:02:15.427 --> 00:02:18.043
The drive wound away in front of me,

9
00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:21.133
twisting and turning as it had always done.

10
00:02:21.642 --> 00:02:23.303
But as I advanced,

11
00:02:23.477 --> 00:02:26.310
I was aware that a change had come upon it.

12
00:02:26.647 --> 00:02:30.481
Nature had come into her own again,and littla by little

13
00:02:30.651 --> 00:02:35.065
had encroached upon the drive with long,tenacious fingers.

14
00:02:37.616 --> 00:02:42.076
On and on wound the poor thread that had once been our drive,

15
00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:46.245
and finally,there was Manderley.

16
00:02:47.084 --> 00:02:49.826
Manderley,secretive and silent.

17
00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.837
Time could not mar the perfect symmetry of those wells.

18
00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:57.753
Moonlight can play odd tricks upon the fancy,

19
00:02:58.095 --> 00:03:02.338
and suddenly it seemed to me that light came from the windows.

20
00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:08.184
And then a cloud came upon the moon

21
00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:12.351
and hovered an instant like a dark hand before a face.

22
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.351
The illusion went with it.

23
00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:19.229
I looked upon a desolate shell

24
00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:23.901
with no whisper of the past about its staring walls.

25
00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:28.155
We can never go back to Manderley again.

26
00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:30.039
That much is certain.

27
00:03:30.252 --> 00:03:34.336
But sometimes in my dreams,I do go back

28
00:03:34.506 --> 00:03:36.588
to the strange days of my life

29
00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:39.875
which began for me in the South of France

30
00:04:14.755 --> 00:04:16.040
No! Stop!

31
00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:19.797
What the devil are you shouting about?

32
00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:24.628
Who are you? What are you staring at?

33
00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:28.299
I'm sorry,I didn't mean to stare,but I... I only thought...

34
00:04:28.477 --> 00:04:31.093
Oh,yon did,did yon? Well,what are you doing here?

35
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:32.807
I was only walking.

36
00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:36.314
Well,get on with your walking. Don't hang about here screaming.

37
00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:04.672
I'll never come to Monte Carlo out of season again.

38
00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:08.134
Not e single well-known personality in the hotel

39
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.891
Stone cold. Waiter!

40
00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:14.769
Gargon! Call him. Tell him to get me some...

41
00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:17.139
Why,it's Max de Winter.

42
00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:19.891
How do you do?

43
00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:25.317
How do you do?

44
00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:28.609
I'm Edytde Van Hopper. It's so nice to run into you here,

45
00:05:28.787 --> 00:05:32.325
just when I was beginning to despair of finding any old friends here in Monte.

46
00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:34.160
But do sit down and have some coffee.

47
00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:35.665
Mr.de Winter is having some coffee with me.

48
00:05:35.836 --> 00:05:38.293
Go and ask that stupid waiter for another cup.

49
00:05:38.463 --> 00:05:40.328
I'm afraid I must contradict you.

50
00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:43.044
You shall both have coffee with me.

51
00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:44.833
Gargon. Coffee,please.

52
00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:46.547
-Cigarette? -No,thank you.

53
00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:49.428
You know I recognized you as soon as you came in,

54
00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:53.558
though I haven't seen you since that night at the casino at Palm Beach.

55
00:05:53.854 --> 00:05:56.220
Perhaps you don't remember an old woman like me.

56
00:05:56.398 --> 00:05:58.229
Are you playinp the tables much here at Monte?

57
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.233
No.I'm afraid that sort of thing ceased to amuse me years ago.

58
00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:02.859
I can well understand that.

59
00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:05.190
As for me,if I had a home like Manderley

60
00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:07.196
I should certainly never come to Monte.

61
00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:09.983
I hear it's one of the biggest places is that part of the country,

62
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:11.867
and you just can't beat it for beauty.

63
00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:15.280
What do you think of Monte Carlo? Or don't you think of it at all?

64
00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:17.699
Well. I think it's rather artificial.

65
00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:20.039
She's spoiled,Mr.de Winter that's her trouble.

66
00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:23.080
Most girls will give their eyes for a chance to see Monte.

67
00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:25.795
Wouldn't that rather defeat the purpose?

68
00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:29.299
Now that we've found each other again,I hope I shall see something of you.

69
00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:31.633
You must come and have a drink in my suite.

70
00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:33.548
I hope they've given you a good room.

71
00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:36.890
The place is empty,so if you're uncomfortable,mind you make s fuss.

72
00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:39.054
Your valet has unpacked for you,I suppose?

73
00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:42.224
I'm afraid I don't possess one. Perhaps you would like to do it for me?

74
00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:46.235
Well,I... I hardly think...

75
00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:48.442
Perhaps you could make yourself useful to Mr. de Winter

76
00:06:48.617 --> 00:06:49.902
if he wants anything done.

77
00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:51.907
You're a capable child in many ways.

78
00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:55.036
That's a charming suggestion,but I'm afraid I cling to the old motto,

79
00:06:55.206 --> 00:06:59.415
¡°He travels fastest who travels alone.¡± Perhaps you've not heard it. Good night.

80
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.331
What do you make of that?

81
00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:05.542
Do you suppose that sudden departure was intended to be funny?

82
00:07:05.717 --> 00:07:08.129
Come,don't sit there gawking,let's go upstairs.

83
00:07:08.303 --> 00:07:10.214
-Have you got the key? -Yes Mrs.Van Hopper

84
00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:13.380
I remember,when I was younger,there was e well-known writer

85
00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:16.641
who used to dart down the back way whenever ha saw we coming.

86
00:07:16.811 --> 00:07:20.429
I suppose he was in love with me and wasn't quite sure of himself.

87
00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:22.347
Well,c'est la vie.

88
00:07:23.735 --> 00:07:26.602
By the way,my dear,don't think that I mean to be unkind,

89
00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:30.029
but you were just a teeny-weeny bit forward with Mr. be Winter.

90
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.691
Your effort to enter the oouversation quite embarrassed me,

91
00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:36.327
and I'm sure it did him. Men loathe that sort of thing.

92
00:07:36.498 --> 00:07:40.366
Oh,come,don't sulk. After all,I am responsible for your behavior here.

93
00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:42.121
Perhaps hedidn¡¯tnotice it.

94
00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:45.662
Poor thing,I suppose he just can't get over his wife's death.

95
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.586
They say he simply adored her.

96
00:07:58.561 --> 00:08:00.051

(CUTLERY CLINKING)

98
00:08:09.447 --> 00:08:11.153
Oh... How awkward of me.

99
00:08:13.243 --> 00:08:15.734
What a stupid thing to do. Oh,I'm so sorry.

100
00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:17.448
Please don't bother. It doesn't really matter.

101
00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:19.613
No,leave that,leave that. Go and lay another place at my table.

102
00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:22.407
-Mademoiselle will have lunch with we. -Oh,but I couldnn't possibly.

103
00:08:22.585 --> 00:08:24.826
-Why not? -Oh,well,please don't be polite. I...

104
00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:27.496
It's very kind of you but I'll be all ripht if they just change the cloth.

105
00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:28.584
I wasn't being polite.

106
00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:29.668
I should have asked you to have lunch with we

107
00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:31.504
even if you hadn't upset the vase so clumsily.

108
00:08:31.678 --> 00:08:32.838
Come along.

109
00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:35.428
We needn't talk to each other if we don't feel like it.

110
00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:37.338
Well,thank you very much.

111
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.846
Oh,I...I'll just have some scrambled eggs.

112
00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:46.356
Oui,mademoiselle.

113
00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:52.441
-What's happened to your friend? -She's ill is bed with a cold.

114
00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:55.406
I'm sorry I wss so rude to you yesterday

115
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:59.368
The only excuse I can offer is that I've become boorish through living alone.

116
00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:02.076
You weren't really. You simbly wanted to be alone and...

117
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:06.118
Tell me,is Mrs.Van Hopper a friend of yours or just a relation?

118
00:09:06.296 --> 00:09:09.379
No,she's my employer.I'm what is known as¡°a paid companion.¡±

119
00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:11.255
I didn't know companionship could be bought.

120
00:09:11.426 --> 00:09:13.212
I looked at the word¡°companion¡± in the dictionary once.

121
00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:15.752
It said,¡°a friend of the bosom.¡±

122
00:09:16.598 --> 00:09:18.509
I don't envy you the privilege.

123
00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:21.720
Well,she's very kind,really,and I have to earn my living.

124
00:09:21.895 --> 00:09:23.431
Haven't you any family?

125
00:09:23.605 --> 00:09:26.017
No. My mother died years and years ago,

126
00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:29.558
and there was only my father,and he died last summer.

127
00:09:30.487 --> 00:09:32.227
And then I took this job.

128
00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:33.899
How rotten for you.

129
00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:37.237
Yes it was rather,because,you see,we got on so well together

130
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.616
You and your father?

131
00:09:38.787 --> 00:09:41.779
Yes. He was a lovely person,very unusual.

132
00:09:41.956 --> 00:09:43.696
-What was he? -A painter.

133
00:09:43.875 --> 00:09:45.240
Ah! Was he a good one?

134
00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:48.831
Well,I thought so,but people didn't understand him.

135
00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:50.916
Yes,that's often the trouble.

136
00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:54.754
He painted trees. At least,it was one tree.

137
00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:57.044
You mean,he painted the same tree over end over again?

138
00:09:57.222 --> 00:10:01.215
Yes. You see,he had a theory that if you should find one perfect thing

139
00:10:01.392 --> 00:10:03.303
or place or person,you should stick to it.

140
00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:04.934
Do you think that's really silly?

141
00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:07.596
Not at all. I'm a firm believer in that myself.

142
00:10:07.774 --> 00:10:10.811
And what did you find to do with yourself while he was painting his tree?

143
00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:14.523
Well,I sat with him and I sketched a little. I don't do it very well,though.

144
00:10:14.697 --> 00:10:16.062
Were you going sketching this afternoon?

145
00:10:16.241 --> 00:10:17.230
Yes.

146
00:10:17.408 --> 00:10:18.944
-Where? -Well,I haven't made up my mind.

147
00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:20.609
I'll drive you somewhere in the car.

148
00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:22.118
Oh,no,I didn't mean...

149
00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:24.529
Oh,nonsense. Finish up that mess,and we'll get along.

150
00:10:24.707 --> 00:10:27.574
Thank you.It's very kind of you,but I'm not very hungry.

151
00:10:27.752 --> 00:10:30.334
Come on. Eat it up like a good girl.

152
00:10:41.724 --> 00:10:43.180
You've taken long enough for that sketch.

153
00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:45.137
I shall expect a really fine work of art.

154
00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:47.097
Oh,no,don't look at it. It's not nearly good enough.

155
00:10:47.272 --> 00:10:49.183
Well,it can't be as bad as all that. Nowbss¡¯tmb it all sat.

156
00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:50.392
Let me see it first.

157
00:10:50.567 --> 00:10:52.603
Well it's the perspective. I never can get it right.

158
00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:54.768
Let me see it,let me see it. Oh,dear.

159
00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:58.029
Tell me,is it the perspective that gives my nose that curious

160
00:10:58.199 --> 00:10:59.188
twist in the middle?

161
00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:01.942
Well,you're not a very easy subject to sketch.Your...

162
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.656
Your expression keeps changing all the time.

163
00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:04.819
Does it?

164
00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:07.910
Well,I'd...I'd concentrate on the view instead,if I were you.

165
00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:10.283
Much more worthwhile.

166
00:11:11.171 --> 00:11:14.413
It rather reminds me of our coastline at home. Do you know Cornwall at all?

167
00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:18.129
Yes,I went there once with my father on holiday. I was in a shop once,

168
00:11:18.344 --> 00:11:23.088
and I saw a postcard with a beautiful house on it,right by the sea.

169
00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:27.100
I asked whose house it was,and the old lady said,¡°That's Manderley.¡±

170
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.931
I felt ashamed for not knowing.

171
00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:30.595
Manderley is beautiful.

172
00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:34.441
But to me,it's just the place where I was horn,

173
00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:38.027
and have lived in all my life.

174
00:11:38.865 --> 00:11:41.732
But now,I don't suppose I shall ever see it again.

175
00:11:48.499 --> 00:11:52.538
(STUTTERING)We're lucky not to be home during the bad weather,aren't we?

176
00:11:54.172 --> 00:11:58.632
I cent ecer remember nn)nying nmimming in Englend till June,nun ynn9

177
00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:04.630
The water's so warm here that I could stay in all day.

178
00:12:04.807 --> 00:12:08.425
There's a dangerous undertow and there was a man drowned here lest year.

179
00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:13.263
I never have any fear of drowning. Have you?

180
00:12:20.698 --> 00:12:22.734
Come,I'll take you home.

181
00:12:36.714 --> 00:12:40.377
Oh,yes,I know Mr.de Winter well. I knew his wife too.

182
00:12:40.551 --> 00:12:43.793
Before she married she was the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth,you know.

183
00:12:43.972 --> 00:12:46.588
She was drowned,poor dear,while she was sailing near Manderley.

184
00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:49.382
He never talks about it,of course,but he's a broken man.

185
00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.471
I suppose I'd better have it.

186
00:12:51.646 --> 00:12:53.386
Wretched stuff! Give me a chocolate,quick!

187
00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:56.935
Oh,there you are.It's about time.

188
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.726
Hurry up. I want to play some rummy.

189
00:13:06.828 --> 00:13:09.194
EDYTHE: She was the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth,you know.

190
00:13:09.372 --> 00:13:11.283
They say he simply ahored her.

191
00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:13.539
She was the beautiful Rebecca Hilbreth,you know.

192
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.996
I suppose he just can't get over his wife's death.

193
00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:18.035
She was the beautiful Rebecca Hilbreth,you know.

194
00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:20.079
But he's a broken man.

195
00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:23.874
Bonjour

196
00:13:24.429 --> 00:13:26.761
-Well,where are you going? -I thought I'd take a tennis lesson.

197
00:13:26.931 --> 00:13:27.966
I see.

198
00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:31.633
I suppose you've had a look at the pro,and he's desperately handsome,

199
00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:34.302
and you've conceived a schoolgirl crush on him.

200
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.186
All right. Go ahead. Make the most of it.

201
00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:40.434
Off duty?

202
00:13:40.611 --> 00:13:43.023
Well,yes. Mrs.Van Hopper's cold's turned into flu,

203
00:13:43.197 --> 00:13:44.232
so she's got a trained nurse.

204
00:13:44.407 --> 00:13:46.113
I'm sorry for the nurse. You keen on tennis?

205
00:13:46.284 --> 00:13:49.526
-Well,not particularly -That's good.We'll go for a drive.

206
00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.006
Good afternoon Mrs.Van Hopper. How are you feeling¡¯?

207
00:14:12.268 --> 00:14:15.055
You got on rather well with him,didn't you?

208
00:14:15.813 --> 00:14:18.805
That pro must have been teaching you other things than tennis.

209
00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:22.562
Hurry up,I want you to make some calls.

210
00:14:22.904 --> 00:14:25.816
I wonder if Mr.de Winter is still in the hotel.

211
00:15:19.168 --> 00:15:20.624
May I go now?

212
00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:24.246
For the number of lessons you've had,you ought to be ready for Wimbledon.

213
00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:26.415
But this will be your last,so make the most of it.

214
00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:29.049
The trouble is,with me laid up like this,you haven't had enough to do.

215
00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:33.088
I'm getting rid of that nurse today.And from now on,you'll stick to your job.

216
00:15:34.183 --> 00:15:35.969
Yes,Mrs.Van Hopper.

217
00:15:38.104 --> 00:15:40.140
-Nurse? -Yes,Mrs.Hopper?

218
00:15:40.314 --> 00:15:43.602
Are you absolutely sure you left those messages for Mr.de Winter?

219
00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:46.609
-Why,yes,madame. -I simply can't believe it.

220
00:15:46.863 --> 00:15:48.945
He would most certainly have called me back.

221
00:15:49.115 --> 00:15:52.198
Oh,well. Poor boy,I simply hate to see him so alone.

222
00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:02.871
You know,I... I wish there could be an invention

223
00:16:03.045 --> 00:16:07.129
that bottled up the memory,like perfume,and it never faded,

224
00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.335
never got stale.

225
00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:11.296
Then whenever I wanted to,I could uncork the bottle

226
00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:13.257
and live the memory all over again.

227
00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:16.047
And what particular moment in your young life would you want to keep?

228
00:16:16.225 --> 00:16:18.181
All of them. All these last few days.

229
00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:22.972
I feel as though I'd...I'd collected a whole shelf full of bottles.

230
00:16:24.609 --> 00:16:27.066
Sowetiwes,you know,those little bottles contain demons

231
00:16:27.236 --> 00:16:28.646
that have a way of popping out at you,

232
00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:31.403
just as you're trying most desperately to forget.

233
00:16:42.752 --> 00:16:44.617
Stop biting your nails.

234
00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:50.707
I wish I were a woman of 36,dressed in black satin with a atring of pearls.

235
00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:54.010
You wouldn't be here with me if you were.

236
00:16:55.932 --> 00:16:59.971
Would you please tell me,Mr.be Winter,why you asked me to come out with you?

237
00:17:00.144 --> 00:17:05.264
It's obvious you want to be kind,but why do you choose me for your charity?

238
00:17:11.739 --> 00:17:15.152
I asked you to come out with me because I wanted your company.

239
00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:16.941
You've blotted out the past for me more than

240
00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:19.861
all the bright lights of Monte Carlo.

241
00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:22.325
But if you think I just asked you out of kindness or charity,

242
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.207
you can leave the car now and find your own way home.

243
00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:27.710
Go on. Open the door and get out.

244

-Better blow your nose. -Thank you.

245
00:17:40.101 --> 00:17:42.467
Please don't call me Mr.de Winter

246
00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:45.182
I have a very impressive array of first name.

00:17:54.532 --> 00:17:57.899
please promise me never to wear black satin or pearls,

251
00:17:58.661 --> 00:18:00.526
or to be 36 years old.

Of course,if you don¡¯t love me,that¡¯s a different thing.

It was so rude of me not to let you know.

That¡¯s rather a coincidence,Mrs.Van Hopper.

00:32:39.416 --> 00:32:42.453
Mrs.Danvers,I do hope we¡¯ll be friends.

466
00:32:43.336 --> 00:32:45.122
You must be petiest with me.

467
00:32:45.297 --> 00:32:48.960
This sort of life is new to me and I do want to make a success of it,

468
00:32:49.134 --> 00:32:50.840
and make Mr.de Winter happy,

469
00:32:51.011 --> 00:32:53.468
so I know I can leave all the household arrangements to you.

470
00:32:53.638 --> 00:32:57.256
Very well.I hope I shall do everything to your satisfaction,madam.

471
00:32:57.434 --> 00:32:59.470
I¡¯ve managed the house since Mrs.de Winter¡¯s death

472
00:32:59.644 --> 00:33:02.010
and Mr.de Winter has never complained.

473
00:33:09.154 --> 00:33:11.486
I think I¡¯ll go downstairs now.

474
00:33:47.192 --> 00:33:51.105
That room in the west wing I was telling you about in there,through that door.

475
00:33:51.279 --> 00:33:52.940
It¡¯s not used now.

476
00:33:53.698 --> 00:33:56.360
It¡¯s the most beautiful room is the house,

477
00:33:56.535 --> 00:33:59.652
the only one that looks down across the lawns to the sea.

478
00:34:01.706 --> 00:34:03.947
It was Mrs.de Winter¡¯s room.

479
00:35:22.912 --> 00:35:25.119
-Good morning. -Good morning.

480
00:35:25.457 --> 00:35:27.448
-Yon¡¯re Mrs.de Winter,aren't you? -Yes.

481
00:35:28.126 --> 00:35:31.664
My name¡¯s Crawley.I manage the estate for Maxim.

482
00:35:32.255 --> 00:35:34.166
Awfully glad to meet you.

483
00:35:34.966 --> 00:35:35.876
(CRAWLEY TITTERS)

484
00:35:36.051 --> 00:35:38.633
A fearful lot of stuff piled up while Maxim was away.

485
00:35:38.803 --> 00:35:42.796
Yes I¡¯m sure there must have been. I do wish I could help with some of it.

486
00:35:43.141 --> 00:35:45.928
No,no. Frank never allows anybody to help him.

487
00:35:46.102 --> 00:35:48.718
He¡¯s like an old mother hen with his bills and rents and taxes.

488
00:35:48.897 --> 00:35:50.478
Come on,Frank,we must go over these estimates.

489
00:35:50.649 --> 00:35:51.980
I¡¯ll get my papers.

490
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:53.560
You¡¯ll find quantities of breakfast over there.

491
00:35:53.735 --> 00:35:55.646
But you must eat it all,or Cook will be mortally offended.

492
00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.276
I¡¯ll do my best,Maxim.

493
00:35:57.447 --> 00:35:58.903
I have to go over the place with Frank,

494
00:35:59.074 --> 00:36:00.655
just to make sure that he hasn't lost any of it.

495
00:36:00.825 --> 00:36:04.534
You¡¯ll be all right,won¡¯t you? Getting acquainted with your new howe?

496
00:36:05.288 --> 00:36:06.903
Have a look at The Times. There¡¯s a thrilling article

497
00:36:07.082 --> 00:36:09.323
on what¡¯s the matter with English cricket.

498
00:36:10.085 --> 00:36:12.167
Oh,yes...

499
00:36:13.088 --> 00:36:15.124
My sister,Beatrice,and her husband,Giles Lacy,

500
00:36:15.298 --> 00:36:16.663
have invited themselves over for lunch.

501
00:36:16.841 --> 00:36:18.206
-Today? -Yes.

502
00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:21.376
I suppose the old girl can¡¯t wait to look you over.

503
00:36:21.554 --> 00:36:23.010
You¡¯ll find her very direct.

504
00:36:23.181 --> 00:36:26.014
If she doesn¡¯t like you,she¡¯ll probably tell you so to your face.

505
00:36:26.393 --> 00:36:28.850
Don¡¯t worry,darling,I¡¯ll be back in time to protect you from her.

506
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:31.682
-Goodbye,darling. -Goodbye,Maxim.

507
00:36:32.107 --> 00:36:33.688
-Goodbye. -Goodbye.

508
00:37:13.773 --> 00:37:16.310
-Good morning,madam. -Good morning,Frith.

509
00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:24.572
Isn¡¯t there anything I could get for you,madam?

510
00:37:24.743 --> 00:37:27.610
No,thank you,Frith. I¡¯m really not very hungry.

511
00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:29.911
Thank you.

512
00:37:30.373 --> 00:37:33.240
-The paper,madam. -Oh,yes. Thank you,Frith.

513
00:37:38.173 --> 00:37:39.504
I slipped.

514
00:37:39.966 --> 00:37:41.581
Thank you,Frith.

515
00:37:46.598 --> 00:37:49.385
-It¡¯s big,isn¡¯t it? -Yes,madam,Manderley is a big place.

516
00:37:49.559 --> 00:37:51.675
This was the banquet hall is the old days.

517
00:37:51.853 --> 00:37:55.596
It¡¯s still used on great occasions,such as a big dinner or a ball.

518
00:37:55.815 --> 00:37:58.602
And the public is admitted here,you know,once a week.

519
00:37:59.652 --> 00:38:01.062
That¡¯s nice.

520
00:38:24.302 --> 00:38:25.542
I beg pardon,madam.

521
00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:29.053
I¡¯m afraid the fire is not usually lit in the library until the afternoon.

522
00:38:29.224 --> 00:38:31.010
But you¡¯ll find one in the morning room.

523
00:38:31.184 --> 00:38:33.300
Of course,if you wish this fire lit now,madam...

524
00:38:33.478 --> 00:38:35.844
No,Frith. I wouldn¡¯t dream of it.

525
00:38:37.232 --> 00:38:38.642
Mrs.de Winter...

526
00:38:39.818 --> 00:38:41.308
I mean,the late Mrs.de Winter

527
00:38:41.486 --> 00:38:44.273
always did her correspondence and telephoning in the morning room,

528
00:38:44.447 --> 00:38:45.436
after breakfast.

529
00:38:45.615 --> 00:38:47.230
Thank you,Frith.

530
00:38:54.332 --> 00:38:55.947
Is anything wrong,madam?

531
00:38:56.125 --> 00:38:58.491
Oh,no. Which way is the morning room?

532
00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:00.752
Oh,it¡¯s that door there,on the left.

533
00:39:00.922 --> 00:39:02.253
Oh,yes,thank you.

534
00:39:50.555 --> 00:39:52.341
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

535
00:39:56.686 --> 00:39:59.644
Mrs.de Winter? Oh,I¡¯m afraid you¡¯ve made a mistake.

536
00:39:59.814 --> 00:40:02.681
Mrs.de Winter¡¯s been dead for ever a year.

537
00:40:03.902 --> 00:40:05.267
Oh,I mean...

538
00:40:08.573 --> 00:40:09.562
Oh.

539
00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:12.441
That was the house telephone,madam.

540
00:40:12.785 --> 00:40:15.993
Probably the head gardener wishing instruction.

541
00:40:17.165 --> 00:40:19.372
Did you want to see me,Mrs.Danvers?

542
00:40:19.584 --> 00:40:22.041
Mr.de Winter informed me that his sister,Mrs.Lacy,and Major Lacy

543
00:40:22.211 --> 00:40:23.747
are expected for luncheon.

544
00:40:24.088 --> 00:40:25.953
I¡¯d like to know if you approve of the menu.

545
00:40:26.132 --> 00:40:29.966
Oh ,well I¡¯m sure it¡¯s very suitable,very nice indeed.

546
00:40:30.136 --> 00:40:32.878
You will notice,madam,that I¡¯ve left a blank space for the sauce.

547
00:40:33.056 --> 00:40:35.843
Mrs.de Winter was most particular about sauces.

548
00:40:36.434 --> 00:40:39.892
Let's have whatever you think that Mrs.de Winter would have ordered.

549
00:40:40.063 --> 00:40:41.769
Thank you,madam.

550
00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:45.432
When you¡¯ve finished your letters,Robert will take them to the post.

551
00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:46.941
My... My letters?

552
00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:51.442
Oh,yes,of course. Thank you,Mrs.Danvers.

553
00:41:49.257 --> 00:41:51.373
-BEATRICE: How are you,Frith? -Good morning,Mrs.Lacy.

554
00:41:51.551 --> 00:41:52.461
Where¡¯s Mr.de Winter?

555
00:41:52.635 --> 00:41:55.172
FRICH: I believe he went down to the farm with Mr.Crawley.

556
00:41:55.346 --> 00:41:58.884
BEATRICE: How tiresome of him not to be bere when we arrive,and how typical.

557
00:42:01.227 --> 00:42:02.512
(WHINING)

558
00:42:11.362 --> 00:42:13.978
BEATRICE: I must say old Danvers keeps the house looking lovely.

559
00:42:14.157 --> 00:42:17.024
She¡¯s certainly learned that trick of arranging flowers from Rebecca.

560
00:42:17.201 --> 00:42:19.032
GIlES: I wonder how she likes it now,

561
00:42:19.203 --> 00:42:21.410
being ordered about by an ex-chorus girl.

562
00:42:21.664 --> 00:42:23.200
BEATRICE: Now,where on Earth did you get the idea

563
00:42:23.374 --> 00:42:24.363
she¡¯s an ex-chorus girl?

564
00:42:24.542 --> 00:42:26.533
He picked her up in the South of France,didn¡¯t he?

565
00:42:26.711 --> 00:42:27.700
What if he did?

566
00:42:28.212 --> 00:42:30.544
Well,I mean to say,there you are.

567
00:42:36.888 --> 00:42:38.879
How do you do?I¡¯m Maxim¡¯s wife.

568
00:42:39.057 --> 00:42:40.388
How do you do?

569
00:42:40.558 --> 00:42:43.140
Well I must say you¡¯re quite different from what I expected.

570
00:42:43.311 --> 00:42:45.768
Don¡¯t be so silly. She¡¯s exactly what I told you she¡¯d be.

571
00:42:45.938 --> 00:42:47.894
Well,how do you like Manderley?

572
00:42:48.066 --> 00:42:49.226
It¡¯s very beautiful,isn¡¯t it?

573
00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:51.561
And how do you get along with Mrs.Danvers?

574
00:42:51.736 --> 00:42:52.725
Well. I...

575
00:42:52.904 --> 00:42:55.236
I¡¯ve never met anyone quite like her before.

576
00:42:55.406 --> 00:42:56.316
You mean,she scares you.

577
00:42:56.491 --> 00:42:58.573
She¡¯s not exactly an oil painting,is she?

578
00:42:58.951 --> 00:43:01.658
Giles,you¡¯re very much in tha way here. Go somewhere else.

579
00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:03.820
Well,I'll try and find Maxim,shall I?

580
00:43:04.123 --> 00:43:05.283
Giles.

581
00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:09.826
I didn¡¯t mean to say anything against Mrs.Danvers.

582
00:43:10.004 --> 00:43:11.995
Oh,there¡¯s no need for you to be frightened of her,

583
00:43:12.173 --> 00:43:15.165
but I shouldn¡¯t have any more to do with her than you can help.

584
00:43:15.343 --> 00:43:18.050
-Shall we sit down? -Yes. Yes,please.

585
00:43:19.138 --> 00:43:21.754
You see,she¡¯s bound to be insanely jealous at first

586
00:43:21.933 --> 00:43:24.174
and she must resent you bitterly.

587
00:43:24.352 --> 00:43:25.558
But why should she?

588
00:43:25.728 --> 00:43:27.218
Don¡¯t you know?

589
00:43:27.396 --> 00:43:29.933
I should have thought Maxim would have told you.

590
00:43:30.108 --> 00:43:32.224
She simply adored Rebecca.

591
00:43:42.328 --> 00:43:44.193
-How are you,Robert? -Quite well,thank you,madam.

592
00:43:44.372 --> 00:43:47.284
-Still having trouble with your teeth? -Unfortunately,you,madam.

593
00:43:47.458 --> 00:43:49.414
You must have them out,all of them.

594
00:43:50.128 --> 00:43:52.494
-Wretched nuisances,teeth. -Thank you,madam.

595
00:43:52.672 --> 00:43:53.787
What a plateful.

596
00:43:53.965 --> 00:43:54.954
Do you hunt?

597
00:43:55.133 --> 00:43:57.249
No,I don¡¯t. I¡¯m afraid I don¡¯t even ride.

598
00:43:57.426 --> 00:43:59.291
Yon have to ride down here,we all do.

599
00:43:59.971 --> 00:44:02.804
Which do you ride,sidesaddle or astride?

600
00:44:03.015 --> 00:44:04.801
Well,of course,I forgot. You don¡¯t,do you?

601
00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:07.516
You must. Nothing else to do around here.

602
00:44:07.687 --> 00:44:10.144
Maxim,when are you going to have parties here again,like the old days?

603
00:44:10.314 --> 00:44:11.520
I haven¡¯t thought about it.

604
00:44:11.691 --> 00:44:14.728
-But everyone¡¯s dying to see you and... -Yes,I bet they are.

605
00:44:14.902 --> 00:44:18.315
Why don¡¯t you have the masquerade ball again this summer?

606
00:44:18.573 --> 00:44:20.359
My dear,are you fond of dancing?

607
00:44:20.533 --> 00:44:22.694
I love it,but I¡¯m not very good at it.

608
00:44:22.869 --> 00:44:24.109
Do you rumba?

609
00:44:24.287 --> 00:44:25.993
-Never tried. -You must teach me.

610
00:44:26.164 --> 00:44:28.951
Actually,I¡¯m trying to find out exactly what your wife does do.

611
00:44:29.792 --> 00:44:30.907
She sketches a little.

612
00:44:31.085 --> 00:44:32.200
Sketches.

613
00:44:32.378 --> 00:44:35.336
Not this modern stuff,I hope,you know,portrait of a lampshade upside down

614
00:44:35.506 --> 00:44:37.371
to represent a soul in torment.

615
00:44:37.842 --> 00:44:39.173
Don¡¯t sail,do you?

616
00:44:39.343 --> 00:44:40.332
No,I don¡¯t.

617
00:44:40.511 --> 00:44:42.422
Thank goodness for that.

618
00:44:43.556 --> 00:44:44.591
Huh?

619
00:44:55.193 --> 00:44:58.026
You¡¯re very much in love with Maxim,aren¡¯t you?

620
00:44:58.237 --> 00:44:59.898
Yes,I can see you are.

621
00:45:00.072 --> 00:45:03.405
Don¡¯t mind my saying so,but why don¡¯t you do something about your hair?

622
00:45:03.576 --> 00:45:06.693
Whydon¡¯tyon days it oat or nwnng it band dndind ynnrsara¡¯?

623
00:45:08.831 --> 00:45:10.696
Oh,no,that¡¯s worse.

624
00:45:10.917 --> 00:45:13.374
What does Maxim say about it? Does he like it like that?

625
00:45:13.544 --> 00:45:15.080
Well,he never mentions it.

626
00:45:15.254 --> 00:45:16.869
Oh. well,don¡¯t go by me.

627
00:45:17.048 --> 00:45:19.790
I can see by the way you dress you don¡¯t care a hoot how you look.

628
00:45:19.967 --> 00:45:23.926
But I wonder Maxim hasn¡¯t been at you. He¡¯s so particular about clothes.

629
00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:26.671
I don¡¯t think he ever notices what I wear.

630
00:45:26.849 --> 00:45:29.261
Oh. He must have changed a lot,then.

631
00:45:32.813 --> 00:45:35.304
You mustn¡¯t worry about old Maxim and his moods.

632
00:45:35.483 --> 00:45:38.190
One never knows what goes on in that quiet mind of his.

633
00:45:38.361 --> 00:45:41.068
Often,he gets into a terrible rage,and when he does...

634
00:45:41.239 --> 00:45:42.445
(WHISTLES)

635
00:45:42.615 --> 00:45:44.151
I don¡¯t suppose he¡¯ll lose his temper with you?

636
00:45:44.325 --> 00:45:45.906
You seem such a placid little thing.

637
00:45:46.077 --> 00:45:48.238
Come on,old girl.We¡¯ve got to go on the first ten at 3:00.

638
00:45:48.412 --> 00:45:49.572
All right,I¡¯m coming.

639
00:45:49.789 --> 00:45:51.745
GILES: Well,goodbye,Maxim,old boy.

640
00:45:51.916 --> 00:45:54.157
Goodbye,Giles. Thanks for coming,old boy.

641
00:45:54.502 --> 00:45:57.619
Goodbye,my dear. Forgive me for asking you so many rude questions.

642
00:45:57.797 --> 00:45:59.708
We both really hope yon¡¯ll be very happy.

643
00:46:00.174 --> 00:46:02.290
Thank you,Beatrice,thank you very much.

644
00:46:02.635 --> 00:46:04.921
And I must congratulate you upon the way Maxim looks.

645
00:46:05.096 --> 00:46:07.428
We were very worried about him this time last year.

646
00:46:07.598 --> 00:46:10.761
But then of course,you know the whole story

647
00:46:12.311 --> 00:46:14.427
-MAXIM: Goodbye,Beatrice. -Goodbye,old boy.

648
00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:20.725
-Goodbye. -Goodbye.

649
00:46:22.196 --> 00:46:23.606
Well,thank heavens they¡¯ve gone.

650
00:46:23.781 --> 00:46:24.941
Now we can have a walk about the place.

651
00:46:25.116 --> 00:46:27.607
Looks as though we might have a shower.but you won¡¯t mind that,will you?

652
00:46:27.785 --> 00:46:29.150
No,but wait a minute. I¡¯ll go upstairs and get a coat.

653
00:46:29.328 --> 00:46:31.740
There¡¯s a heap of mackintoshes in the flower room. Robert?

654
00:46:31.956 --> 00:46:34.618
Run and get a coat from the flower room for Mrs.de Winter,will you?

655
00:46:34.875 --> 00:46:36.115
What do you think of Beatrice?

656
00:46:36.294 --> 00:46:38.250
Oh,I liked her very much,but she kept saying

657
00:46:38.421 --> 00:46:40.161
that I was quite different from what she expected.

658
00:46:40.339 --> 00:46:41.374
What the devil did she expect?

659
00:46:41.549 --> 00:46:45.212
Oh,someone smarter and more sophisticated,I¡¯m afraid.

660
00:46:46.637 --> 00:46:48.377
Do you like my hair?

661
00:46:48.639 --> 00:46:51.255
Your hair? Yes,of course I do. What¡¯s the matter with it?

662
00:46:51.434 --> 00:46:53.470
Oh,I don¡¯t know. I just wondered.

663
00:46:54.186 --> 00:46:55.847
How funny you are.

664
00:46:56.188 --> 00:46:57.177
Thank you.

665
00:46:58.316 --> 00:47:00.272
-Do I have to put it on? -Yes,certainly,certainly,certainly.

666
00:47:00.443 --> 00:47:01.899
You can¡¯t be too careful with children.

667
00:47:02.069 --> 00:47:04.401
Come on,Jasper.Come and take some of that fat off.

668
00:47:14.457 --> 00:47:16.743
Jasper! Here. Hot that way! Come here!

669
00:47:16.917 --> 00:47:18.498
(MAXIM WHISTLES)

670
00:47:19.170 --> 00:47:20.751
Where does that lead to?

671
00:47:20.921 --> 00:47:23.458
Oh,it leads to a little cove where we used to keep a boat.

672
00:47:23.632 --> 00:47:24.667
Oh.let¡¯s go down there.

673
00:47:24.842 --> 00:47:26.958
Well,no.It¡¯s a perfectly dull,uninteresting stretch of sand,

674
00:47:27.136 --> 00:47:29.593
-just like any other. -Oh,please.

675
00:47:29.764 --> 00:47:34.178
Well,all right.We¡¯ll walk down and take a look if you really want to.

(BARKING)

677
00:47:41.692 --> 00:47:44.308
That¡¯s Jasper.There must be something wrong.

678
00:47:44.487 --> 00:47:46.569
-Perhaps he¡¯s hurt himself. -No,he¡¯s all right,leave him alone.

679
00:47:46.739 --> 00:47:47.694
Don¡¯t you think I¡¯d better go and see?

680
00:47:47.865 --> 00:47:49.776
Don¡¯t bother about him,I tell you,he can't come to any harm.

681
00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:51.815
He¡¯ll find his own way back!

What do you want in there,Jasper? Come on. Come on home.Let¡¯s go home.

686
00:48:14.517 --> 00:48:15.597
Jasper...

687
00:48:26.612 --> 00:48:27.601
Oh.

688
00:48:28.864 --> 00:48:31.571
I didn¡¯t know that there was anybody...

689
00:48:31.742 --> 00:48:33.357
I know that dog.

690
00:48:33.536 --> 00:48:35.242
He comes from the house.

691
00:48:35.413 --> 00:48:36.744
He ain¡¯t yours.

692
00:48:36.914 --> 00:48:39.075
No.He¡¯s Mr.de Winter¡¯s dog.

693
00:48:40.418 --> 00:48:43.125
Have you anything I could tie him with?

694
00:49:16.245 --> 00:49:17.530
Come on,Jasper.

695
00:49:17.705 --> 00:49:20.993
You won¡¯t tell anyone you saw me in there,will you?

696
00:49:21.167 --> 00:49:22.953
Don¡¯t you belong on the estate?

697
00:49:23.127 --> 00:49:24.833
I weren¡¯t doing nothing.

698
00:49:25.004 --> 00:49:27.461
I was just putting me shells away.

699
00:49:27.631 --> 00:49:30.043
She¡¯s gone in the sea,ain¡¯t she?

700
00:49:30.718 --> 00:49:33.050
She¡¯ll never come back no more.

701
00:49:33.804 --> 00:49:35.965
No.She¡¯ll never come back.

702
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:38.964
Come on,Jasper.

703
00:49:57.828 --> 00:50:00.194
Maxim!What¡¯s the matter?

704
00:50:00.623 --> 00:50:01.783
Maxim!

705
00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:07.417
I¡¯m sorry I was such a time,but I had to find a rope for Jasper.

706
00:50:07.588 --> 00:50:09.419
Hurry up,Jasper,for heaven¡¯s sake.

707
00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:12.832
Please wait for me. Maxim,what is it? You look so angry.

708
00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:15.217
You know I didn¡¯t want you to go there,but you deliberately went.

709
00:50:15.387 --> 00:50:18.379
Why not? There was only a cottage down there and a strange man who...

710
00:50:18.557 --> 00:50:20.843
-You didn¡¯t go in the cottage,did yon? -Yes,the door was...

711
00:50:21.018 --> 00:50:22.474
-Don¡¯t go there again,do you hear? -Well,why not?

712
00:50:22.645 --> 00:50:24.055
Because I hate the place. And if you had my memories,

713
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:26.016
you wouldn¡¯t go there or talk about it or even think about it.

714
00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:28.306
What¡¯s the matter? Oh,l¡¯m sorry,please.

715
00:50:29.193 --> 00:50:30.899
We should have stayed away.

716
00:50:31.487 --> 00:50:34.399
We should never have come back to Manderley.

717
00:50:35.407 --> 00:50:37.318
Oh,what a fool I was.

718
00:50:39.495 --> 00:50:42.328
I¡¯ve made you unhappy.Somehow,I¡¯ve hurt you.

719
00:50:42.831 --> 00:50:45.163
Oh,I can¡¯t bear to see you like this

720
00:50:45.709 --> 00:50:47.825
because I love you so much.

721
00:50:49.505 --> 00:50:50.711
Do you?

722
00:50:52.716 --> 00:50:53.876
Do you?

723
00:50:55.886 --> 00:50:57.751
I¡¯ve made you cry.

724
00:50:58.222 --> 00:50:59.553
Forgive me.

725
00:51:02.935 --> 00:51:06.302
I sometimes seem to fly off the handle for no reason at all.

726
00:51:08.941 --> 00:51:10.181
Don¡¯t I?

727
00:51:11.735 --> 00:51:15.978
Come,we¡¯ll go home and have some tea and forget all about it.

728
00:51:16.156 --> 00:51:18.488
Yes,let¡¯s forget all about it.

729
00:51:18.951 --> 00:51:20.987
Here,let me have Jasper.

730
00:51:50.399 --> 00:51:53.232
-Hello. Come in. -Oh,please don't get up,Mr.Crawley.

731
00:51:53.402 --> 00:51:55.768
I was just wondering if you meant what you said the other day

732
00:51:55.946 --> 00:51:59.063
-about showing me the run of things. -Of course I did.

733
00:51:59.617 --> 00:52:00.857
What are you doing now?

734
00:52:01.035 --> 00:52:01.945
Notifying all the tenants

735
00:52:02.119 --> 00:52:04.906
that in celebration of Maxim¡¯s return with his bride,

736
00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:06.365
this week¡¯s rent will he free.

737
00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:07.495
Oh,is that Maxim¡¯s idea?

738
00:52:07.666 --> 00:52:10.282
Oh,yes,all the servants get an extra week¡¯s wages,too.

739
00:52:10.461 --> 00:52:12.122
Od,he didn¡¯t tell me.

740
00:52:12.963 --> 00:52:15.625
Can¡¯t I help you? I could at least lick the stamps.

741
00:52:15.799 --> 00:52:18.586
Well,that¡¯s terribly nice of you. Won¡¯t you sit down?

742
00:52:18.761 --> 00:52:20.297
Yes,thank you.

743
00:52:25.809 --> 00:52:28.892
I was down at the cottage on the beach the other day.

744
00:52:29.271 --> 00:52:31.808
There was a man there,a queer sort of person.

745
00:52:31.982 --> 00:52:33.472
Jasper kept barking at him.

746
00:52:33.651 --> 00:52:35.482
Oh,yes,it must have been Ben.

747
00:52:35.653 --> 00:52:37.689
Excuse me.He¡¯s quite harmless.

748
00:52:37.863 --> 00:52:40.070
We give him odd jobs now and then.

749
00:52:40.491 --> 00:52:43.153
That cottage bay seemed to be going to rack and ruin.

750
00:52:43.327 --> 00:52:45.443
Why isn't something done about it?

751
00:52:45.621 --> 00:52:49.239
I think if Maxim wanted anything done about it,he¡¯d tell me.

752
00:52:50.584 --> 00:52:53.496
Are those all Redecca¡¯s things down there?

753
00:52:54.546 --> 00:52:55.626
Yes.

754
00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:57.830
Yes,they are.

755
00:52:58.842 --> 00:53:01.003
What did she use the cottage for?

756
00:53:01.178 --> 00:53:03.043
The boat used to be moored near there.

757
00:53:03.222 --> 00:53:05.133
What boat? What happened to it?

758
00:53:05.307 --> 00:53:08.299
Was that the boat she was sailing in when she was drowned?

759
00:53:10.229 --> 00:53:14.563
Yes. It capsized and sank. She was washed overboard.

760
00:53:14.733 --> 00:53:17.224
Wasn¡¯t she afraid to go out like that alone?

761
00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:20.606
She wasn¡¯t afraid of anything.

762
00:53:23.701 --> 00:53:25.692
Where did they find her?

763
00:53:27.913 --> 00:53:29.153
Near Edgecombe,

764
00:53:29.331 --> 00:53:32.118
about 40 miles up channel about two months afterwards.

765
00:53:32.793 --> 00:53:35.079
Maxim went up to identify her.

766
00:53:35.796 --> 00:53:37.707
It was horrible for him.

767
00:53:38.048 --> 00:53:39.913
Yes,it must have been.

768
00:53:43.804 --> 00:53:47.717
Mr.Crawley,please don¡¯t think me morbidly curious. It isn¡¯t that.It¡¯s...

769
00:53:47.891 --> 00:53:50.678
It¡¯s just that I feel at such a disadvantage.

770
00:53:50.894 --> 00:53:54.682
All the time,whenever I meet anyone,Maxim¡¯s sister or even the servants,

771
00:53:54.857 --> 00:53:56.563
I know they¡¯re all thinking the same thing,

772
00:53:56.734 --> 00:54:00.272
that they¡¯re all comparing me with her with Rebecca.

773
00:54:00.446 --> 00:54:02.232
You mustn¡¯t think that.

774
00:54:02.406 --> 00:54:04.863
I can¡¯t tell you how glad I am that you married Maxim.

775
00:54:05.033 --> 00:54:07.240
It¡¯s going to make all the difference to his life.

776
00:54:07.411 --> 00:54:09.743
From my point of view,it¡¯s very refreshing

777
00:54:09.913 --> 00:54:11.449
to find someone like yourself,

778
00:54:11.623 --> 00:54:14.911
who¡¯s not entirely in tune,shall we say,with Manderley.

779
00:54:15.627 --> 00:54:17.583
That¡¯s very sweet of you.

780
00:54:17.921 --> 00:54:20.412
I daresay I¡¯ve been stupid,

781
00:54:20.716 --> 00:54:25.085
but every day I realize the things she had that I lack.

782
00:54:25.596 --> 00:54:28.383
Beauty and wit and intelligence,

783
00:54:28.557 --> 00:54:31.720
and all the things that are so important in a woman.

784
00:54:31.894 --> 00:54:34.510
You have qualities that are just as important,

785
00:54:34.688 --> 00:54:36.599
more important,if I may say so.

786
00:54:37.107 --> 00:54:39.769
Kindliness and sincerity,

787
00:54:40.152 --> 00:54:42.484
and if you¡¯ll forgive me,modesty,

788
00:54:42.654 --> 00:54:46.272
mean more to a husband than all the wit and beauty in the world.

789
00:54:46.784 --> 00:54:48.866
We,none of us want to live in the past,

790
00:54:49.036 --> 00:54:50.776
Maxim least of all.

791
00:54:51.246 --> 00:54:54.659
It¡¯s up to you,you know,to lead us away frow it.

792
00:54:55.542 --> 00:54:56.452
Right.

793
00:54:56.627 --> 00:54:59.334
I promise you I won¡¯t bring this up again,

794
00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:01.791
but before we end this conversation,

795
00:55:01.965 --> 00:55:04.456
would you answer just one more question?

796
00:55:04.843 --> 00:55:08.961
If it's something I¡¯m able to answer,I¡¯ll do my best.

797
00:55:10.307 --> 00:55:13.049
Tell we,what was Rebecca really like?

798
00:55:22.986 --> 00:55:24.396
I suppose...

799
00:55:25.823 --> 00:55:29.532
I suppose she was the most beautiful creature I ever saw.

800
00:56:01.984 --> 00:56:03.349
Good evening,Maxim.

801
00:56:03.527 --> 00:56:05.939
Hello. The films of the honeymoon have arrived at last.

802
00:56:06.113 --> 00:56:08.399
Do we have time,do you think,before dinner?

803
00:56:13.287 --> 00:56:15.118
What on Earth have you done to yourself?

804
00:56:15.289 --> 00:56:17.701
Oh,nothing. I just ordered a new dress frow London.

805
00:56:17.875 --> 00:56:19.035
I hope you don¡¯t mind.

806
00:56:19.209 --> 00:56:23.043
Oh,no,no. Only,do you think that sort of thing¡¯s right for you?

807
00:56:23.213 --> 00:56:26.705
-It doesn¡¯t seem your type at all. -I thought you¡¯d like it.

808
00:56:26.884 --> 00:56:29.500
And what have you done to your hair?

809
00:56:30.053 --> 00:56:31.384
Oh,I see.

810
00:56:31.847 --> 00:56:33.587
Dear,oh,dear.I¡¯m sorry.

811
00:56:34.433 --> 00:56:36.344
You look lovely,lovely.

812
00:56:36.518 --> 00:56:38.759
It¡¯s very nice,for a change.

813
00:56:41.648 --> 00:56:45.061
-Shall we see these pictures? -Yes. I'd love to see them.

814
00:56:53.702 --> 00:56:56.193
Look now,look at that.

815
00:56:56.371 --> 00:56:57.611
MRS.De WINTER:Wasn¡¯t it wonderful,darling?

816
00:56:57.789 --> 00:56:58.824
Can¡¯t we go back there someday?

817
00:56:58.999 --> 00:57:01.206
MAXIM:Yes,of course. Of course. Look at you.

818
00:57:01.376 --> 00:57:04.834
Won¡¯t our grandchildren be delighted when they see how lovely you were?

819
00:57:05.005 --> 00:57:06.085
MRS.DE WINTER:Oh,look at you.

820
00:57:06.256 --> 00:57:07.871
(MAXIM LAUGHING)

821
00:57:08.926 --> 00:57:10.257
MRS.DE WINTER:Oh,I like that.

822
00:57:11.219 --> 00:57:12.208
Look at that.

823
00:57:12.721 --> 00:57:13.927
MAXIM: Yes,very nice.

824
00:57:14.431 --> 00:57:15.716
-Remember that? -MAXIM:Yes.

825
00:57:15.891 --> 00:57:18.132
I wish our honeymoon could have lasted forever,Maxim.

826
00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:20.050
Dash it,look.

827
00:57:21.438 --> 00:57:22.769
Hang it.

828
00:57:23.273 --> 00:57:25.764
I¡¯ve threaded it up wrong as usual or something.

829
00:57:29.446 --> 00:57:30.401
Yes,Frith. What is it?

830
00:57:30.572 --> 00:57:32.779
Excuse me,sir. May I have a word with you?

831
00:57:34.284 --> 00:57:36.445
Yes. Come in.

832
00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:38.611
It¡¯s about Robert,sir

833
00:57:39.122 --> 00:57:41.238
There¡¯s been a slight unpleasantness between him and Mrs.Danvers.

834
00:57:41.416 --> 00:57:42.371
Oh. dear.

835
00:57:42.542 --> 00:57:44.749
-Robert is very upset. -This is trouble.

836
00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:45.875
What is it?

837
00:57:46.046 --> 00:57:49.334
It appears that Mrs.Danvers has accused Robert of stealing a valuable ornament

838
00:57:49.508 --> 00:57:50.463
from the morning room.

839
00:57:50.634 --> 00:57:53.671
Robert denies the accusation most emphatically,sir.

840
00:57:55.305 --> 00:57:57.796
-What was the thing,anyway? -China cupid,sir.

841
00:57:57.975 --> 00:57:59.966
Oh,dear.That¡¯s one of our treasures,isn¡¯t it?

842
00:58:00.352 --> 00:58:02.718
Well,tell Mrs. Danvers to get to the bottom of it somehow.

843
00:58:02.896 --> 00:58:05.558
-Tell her I¡¯m sure it wasn¡¯t Robert. -Very good,sir.

844
00:58:05.732 --> 00:58:08.940
Why do they come to me with these things?That¡¯s your job,sweetheart.

845
00:58:09.152 --> 00:58:12.485
Maxim,I wanted to tell you,but I forgot.

846
00:58:14.574 --> 00:58:17.316
The fact is,I broke the china cupid.

847
00:58:17.494 --> 00:58:18.404
You broke it?

848
00:58:18.578 --> 00:58:21.661
Now,why on Earth didn¡¯t you say something about it when Frith was here?

849
00:58:21.832 --> 00:58:23.823
I don¡¯t know. I didn¡¯t like to.

850
00:58:24.001 --> 00:58:25.741
I was afraid he¡¯d think me a fool.

851
00:58:25.919 --> 00:58:27.500
He¡¯ll think you much more of a fool now.

852
00:58:27.671 --> 00:58:29.502
You¡¯ll have to explain to him and Mrs.Danvers.

853
00:58:29.673 --> 00:58:31.459
Oh,no,Maxim. You do it.I¡¯ll go upstairs.

854
00:58:31.633 --> 00:58:32.839
Don¡¯t be such a littla idiot,darling.

855
00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:35.342
Anybody would think you were afraid of them.

856
00:58:36.722 --> 00:58:37.711
MAXIM:It¡¯s all a mistake,Mrs.Danvers.

857
00:58:37.889 --> 00:58:39.345
Apparently,Mrs.be Winter broke the cupid herself

858
00:58:39.516 --> 00:58:42.007
end forgot to say anything about it.

859
00:58:42.185 --> 00:58:46.394
I¡¯m so sorry. I never thought that I¡¯d get Robert into trouble.

860
00:58:46.565 --> 00:58:48.897
Is it possible to repair the ornament,madam?

861
00:58:49.317 --> 00:58:52.229
No,I¡¯m afraid it isn¡¯t. It smashed into pieces.

862
00:58:53.030 --> 00:58:55.442
What did you do with the pieces?

863
00:58:56.575 --> 00:59:00.363
Well,I put them at the back of one of the drawers in the writing desk.

864
00:59:00.537 --> 00:59:02.493
Well,it looks as though Mrs.de Winter was afraid

865
00:59:02.664 --> 00:59:04.905
you were going to put her in prison,doesn¡¯t it,Mrs. Danvers?

866
00:59:05.083 --> 00:59:07.199
Well,never mind. Do what you can to find the pieces.

867
00:59:07.377 --> 00:59:10.619
See if they can be mended,and above all,tell Robert to dry his tears.

868
00:59:10.797 --> 00:59:14.255
I shall apologize to Robert,of course. Perhaps if such a thing happens again,

869
00:59:14.426 --> 00:59:16.007
Mrs.de Winter will tell me personally.

870
00:59:16.178 --> 00:59:17.964
MAXIM:Yes,yes,all right. Thank you,Mrs.Danvers.

871
00:59:23.602 --> 00:59:26.309
Well,I suppose that clip will hold all right. I don¡¯t know.

872
00:59:31.735 --> 00:59:35.193
MRS.DE WINTER:I¡¯m awfully sorry darling.It was very careless of me.

873
00:59:35.697 --> 00:59:38.359
-Mrs.Danvers must be furious with me. -Hang Mrs.Danvers.

874
00:59:38.533 --> 00:59:40.649
Why on Earth should you be frightened of her?

875
00:59:40.827 --> 00:59:43.193
You behave more like an upstairs maid or something,

876
00:59:43.371 --> 00:59:46.579
-not the mistress of the house at all. -Yes. I know I do.

877
00:59:47.167 --> 00:59:49.203
But I feel so uncomfortable.

878
00:59:49.377 --> 00:59:53.336
I try my best every day,but it¡¯s very difficult with people looking me

879
00:59:53.507 --> 00:59:56.499
up and down as if I were a prize cow.

880
00:59:56.676 --> 00:59:58.291
What does it matter if they do? You must remember

881
00:59:58.470 --> 01:00:02.463
that life at Manderley is the only thing that interests anybody down here.

882
01:00:02.641 --> 01:00:05.428
What a slap in the aye I must have been to them,then.

883
01:00:05.852 --> 01:00:07.888
I suppose that¡¯s why you married me,

884
01:00:08.063 --> 01:00:11.555
because you knew I was dull and gauche and inexperienced,

885
01:00:11.733 --> 01:00:14.190
and there¡¯d never be any gossip about me.

886
01:00:14.361 --> 01:00:17.273
Gossip?What do you mean?

887
01:00:17.906 --> 01:00:20.898
I don¡¯t know. I just said it for something to say.

888
01:00:21.076 --> 01:00:23.692
Don¡¯t look at me like that. Maxim.

889
01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:27.367
What¡¯s the matter? What have I said?

890
01:00:33.713 --> 01:00:35.920
Wasn¡¯t a very attractive thing to say,was it?

891
01:00:36.091 --> 01:00:39.675
No.It was rude,hateful.

892
01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:47.933
I wonder if I did a very selfish thing in marrying you.

893
01:00:48.103 --> 01:00:49.639
How do you mean?

894
01:00:49.813 --> 01:00:52.304
I¡¯m not much of a companion to you,am I?

895
01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:55.815
You don¡¯t get much fun,do you?

896
01:00:56.653 --> 01:01:00.020
You ought to have married a boy,someone of your own age.

897
01:01:00.282 --> 01:01:03.490
Maxim,why do you say this? Of course we¡¯re companions.

898
01:01:03.869 --> 01:01:07.202
Ars we? I don't know.

899
01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:10.701
-I¡¯m very difficult to live with. -No,you¡¯re not difficult.

900
01:01:10.876 --> 01:01:12.332
You¡¯re easy,very easy.

901
01:01:13.044 --> 01:01:16.252
Our marriage is a success,isn¡¯t it,a great success?

902
01:01:16.423 --> 01:01:19.165
We¡¯re happy,aren¡¯t we? Terribly happy?

903
01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:29.716
If you don¡¯t think we are happy,

904
01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:33.436
it would be much better if you didn¡¯t pretend.

905
01:01:34.274 --> 01:01:35.730
I¡¯ll go away.

906
01:01:39.237 --> 01:01:41.193
Why don¡¯t you answer me?

907
01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:45.273
How can I answer you

908
01:01:45.911 --> 01:01:48.527
when I don¡¯t know the answer myself?

909
01:01:50.165 --> 01:01:53.328
If you say we¡¯re happy,let¡¯s leave it at that.

910
01:01:53.835 --> 01:01:56.827
Happiness is something I know nothing about.

911
01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:05.718
Oh,look.There¡¯s the one when I left the camera

912
01:02:05.889 --> 01:02:08.221
running on the tripod,remember?

913
01:02:08.683 --> 01:02:10.048
(INAUDIBLE)

914
01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:03.689
Pardon me,madam. Is there anything I can do for you?

915
01:03:03.863 --> 01:03:06.024
I¡¯m all right,Hilda. Thank you very much.

916
01:03:06.366 --> 01:03:09.278
I¡¯ll bring the sandwiches immediately,madam.

917
01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:35.888
-Hilda. -Yes,madam?

918
01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:40.518
The west wing. Nobody ever uses it anymore,do they?

919
01:03:40.692 --> 01:03:43.980
No,madam. Not since the death of Mrs.de Winter.

920
01:04:02.464 --> 01:04:03.954

(DOOR CLOSING)

922

MRS.DANVERS:Come along,Mr.Jack,or someone may see you.

923
01:04:08.219 --> 01:04:11.006
FAVELL:Well,Danny old harpy it¡¯s been good to see you again.

924
01:04:11.348 --> 01:04:13.839
I¡¯ve been simply breathless to pick up all the news.

(BARKING)

926
01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:17.141
MRS.DANVERS: I really don¡¯t think it¡¯s wise for you to come here,Mr.Jack.

927
01:04:17.312 --> 01:04:18.222
(SOFTLY)Jasper,come here.

928
01:04:18.396 --> 01:04:20.887
FAVELL: Oh,nonsense,nonsense. It¡¯s just like coming back home.

929
01:04:21.066 --> 01:04:22.021
MRS. DANVERS: Quiet,Mr.Jack.

930
01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:24.683
FAVELL:Yes.We must be careful not to shock Cinderella,mustn¡¯t we?

931
01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:26.351
MRS.DANVERS: She¡¯s in the morning room.

932
01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:28.520
If you leave through the garden door,she won¡¯t see you.

933
01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:30.689
FAVELL:I must say,I feel a little like the poor relation,

934
01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:33.028
sneaking around through back doors.

935
01:04:33.787 --> 01:04:35.277
Well,toodle-oo,Danny

936
01:04:35.455 --> 01:04:37.537
MRS.DANVERS: Goodbye,Mr.Jack,and please be careful.

937
01:04:37.707 --> 01:04:38.742
(DOOR CLOSING)

938
01:04:38.917 --> 01:04:39.827
(WHINING)

939
01:04:40.001 --> 01:04:41.616
Jasper,be quiet.

940
01:04:44.214 --> 01:04:45.704
FAVELL: Looking for me?

941
01:04:46.091 --> 01:04:47.922
-I didn¡¯t make you jump,did I? -No.

942
01:04:48.134 --> 01:04:51.046
Of course not. I didn¡¯t quite know who it was.

943
01:04:51.221 --> 01:04:55.464
Yes.You¡¯re pleased to see me,aren¡¯t you,old boy?

944
01:04:55.642 --> 01:04:59.100
I¡¯m glad there¡¯s someone in the family to welcome me back to Manderley.

945
01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:03.726
And how is dear old Max?

946
01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:06.565
Very well,thank you.

947
01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:10.403
I hear he went up to London,left his little bride all alone.

948
01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:12.109
It¡¯s too bad.

949
01:05:12.409 --> 01:05:16.243
Isn't he rather afraid that somebody might come down and carry you off?

950
01:05:17.705 --> 01:05:20.913
Danny,all your precautions were in vain.

951
01:05:21.084 --> 01:05:24.417
The mistress of the house was hiding behind the door.

952
01:05:26.464 --> 01:05:29.752
Oh. What about presenting me to the bride?

953
01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:32.042
This is Mr.Favell.madam.

954
01:05:32.804 --> 01:05:34.294
How do you do?

955
01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:37.088
How do you do?

956
01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:43.307
-Won¡¯t you have some tea or something? -Now,isn¡¯t that a charming invitation?

957
01:05:43.481 --> 01:05:46.393
I¡¯ve been asked to tea,Danny,and I¡¯ve a good mind to accept.

958
01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:51.273
Oh,well,perhaps you're right. Pity,just when we were getting on so nicely.

959
01:05:51.614 --> 01:05:54.856
We mustn¡¯t lead the young bride astray must me,Jasper?

960
01:05:55.743 --> 01:05:58.155
Goodbye.It¡¯s been fun meeting you.

961
01:05:58.371 --> 01:06:02.239
Oh,and by the way,it would be very decent of you if you didn¡¯t mention

962
01:06:02.417 --> 01:06:04.624
this little visit to your revered husband.

963
01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:07.418
He doesn¡¯t exactly approve of me.

964
01:06:08.047 --> 01:06:10.709
-Very well. -That¡¯s very sporting of you.

965
01:06:11.217 --> 01:06:14.425
I wish I had a young bride of three months waiting for me at home.

966
01:06:15.138 --> 01:06:17.925
I¡¯m just a lonely old bachelor.

967
01:06:18.099 --> 01:06:19.635
Fare thee well.

968
01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:23.719
Oh,and I know what was wrong with that introduction.

969
01:06:23.897 --> 01:06:25.637
Danny didn¡¯t tell you,did she?

970
01:06:26.316 --> 01:06:28.648
I am Rebecca¡¯s favorite cousin.

971
01:06:30.445 --> 01:06:31.776
Toodle-oo!

972
01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:27.096
(WINDOW SLAMMING)

973
01:08:29.731 --> 01:08:31.847
Do you wish anything,madam?

974
01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:40.947
I didn¡¯t expect to see you,Mrs.Danvers.

975
01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:43.859
I noticed that a window wasn¡¯t cloned and I came up to see

976
01:08:44.037 --> 01:08:46.153
-if I could fasten it. -Why did you say that?

977
01:08:46.331 --> 01:08:51.200
I closed it before I left the room. You opened it yourself,didn¡¯t you?

978
01:08:52.587 --> 01:08:55.294
You¡¯ve always wanted to see this room,haven¡¯t you,madam?

979
01:08:55.465 --> 01:08:57.626
Why did you never ask me to show it to you?

980
01:08:58.426 --> 01:09:00.712
I was ready to show it to you every day.

981
01:09:05.350 --> 01:09:07.591
It¡¯s a lovely room,isn¡¯t it?

982
01:09:07.769 --> 01:09:09.930
Loveliest room you¡¯ve ever seen.

983
01:09:10.104 --> 01:09:12.561
Everything is kept just as Mrs. de Winter liked it.

984
01:09:12.732 --> 01:09:15.064
Nothing has been altered since that last night.

985
01:09:15.652 --> 01:09:18.359
Come.I¡¯ll show you her dressing room.

986
01:09:21.783 --> 01:09:24.399
Thin is where I keep all her clothes.

987
01:09:25.286 --> 01:09:28.119
You would like to see them,wouldn¡¯t you?

988
01:09:39.342 --> 01:09:40.673
Feel this.

989
01:09:42.553 --> 01:09:45.761
It was a Christmas present from Mr.de Winter.

990
01:09:48.267 --> 01:09:51.350
He was always giving her expensive gifts,the whole year round.

991
01:09:53.856 --> 01:09:56.347
I keep her underwear on this side.

992
01:09:58.736 --> 01:10:02.524
They were made specially for her by the nuns in the Convent of St.Claire.

993
01:10:06.452 --> 01:10:09.615
I always used to wait up for her no matter how late.

994
01:10:09.789 --> 01:10:13.657
Sometimes she and Mr.de Winter didn¡¯t come home until dawn.

995
01:10:15.712 --> 01:10:19.000
While she was undressing,she¡¯d tell me about the party she¡¯d been to.

996
01:10:19.173 --> 01:10:21.255
She knew everyone that mattered.

997
01:10:21.426 --> 01:10:23.166
Everyone loved her.

998
01:10:25.847 --> 01:10:27.963
When she finished her bath,

999
01:10:28.391 --> 01:10:31.428
she¡¯d go into the bedroom and go over to the dressing table.

1000
01:10:42.113 --> 01:10:45.401
Oh,you¡¯ve moved her brush,haven¡¯t you? There.That's better.

1001
01:10:45.575 --> 01:10:47.736
Just as she always laid it down.

1002
01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:50.071
¡°Come on,Danny. Hair drill,¡± she would say.

1003
01:10:50.455 --> 01:10:54.698
And I¡¯d stand behind her like this and brush away for 20 minutes at a time.

1004
01:10:55.752 --> 01:10:59.290
And then she would say,¡°Good night,Danny,¡±

1005
01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:02.455
and step into her bed.

1006
01:11:10.224 --> 01:11:14.217
I embroidered this case for her myself,and I keep it here always.

1007
01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:25.777
Did you ever see anything so delicate?

1008
01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:42.416
Look. You can see my hand through it.

1009
01:12:04.403 --> 01:12:07.816
You wouldn¡¯t think she¡¯d been gone so long,would you?

1010
01:12:08.533 --> 01:12:10.819
Sometimes when I walk along the corridor,

1011
01:12:11.035 --> 01:12:13.367
I fancy I hear her just behind me.

1012
01:12:13.538 --> 01:12:17.030
That quick light step. I couldn't mistake it anywhere.

1013
01:12:18.125 --> 01:12:21.743
Not only in this room,it¡¯s in all the rooms in the house.

1014
01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:25.163
I can almost hear it now.

1015
01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:29.504
Do you think the dead come back and watch the living?

1016
01:12:29.679 --> 01:12:31.670
No.I don¡¯t believe it.

1017
01:12:32.723 --> 01:12:37.308
Sometimes I wonder if she doesn¡¯t come back here to Manderley,

1018
01:12:38.271 --> 01:12:40.808
and watch you and Mr.de Winter together.

1019
01:12:43.276 --> 01:12:44.812
You look tired.

1020
01:12:45.444 --> 01:12:48.356
Why don¡¯t you stay here a while and rest?

1021
01:12:48.573 --> 01:12:50.234
And listen to the sea.

1022
01:12:52.618 --> 01:12:54.028
So soothing.

1023
01:12:56.789 --> 01:12:58.245
Listen to it.

1024
01:13:02.378 --> 01:13:03.538
Listen.

1025
01:13:06.799 --> 01:13:08.460
Listen to the sea.

1026
01:13:37.288 --> 01:13:40.075
Tell Mrs.Danvers I wish to see her immediately.

1027
01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:09.020
You sent for me,madam?

1028
01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:11.940
Yes,Mrs.Danvers.

1029
01:14:12.782 --> 01:14:14.647
I want you to get rid of all these things.

1030
01:14:14.825 --> 01:14:19.535
-These are Mrs.de Winter's things. -I am Mrs.de Winter now.

1031
01:14:21.415 --> 01:14:23.326
Very well.I¡¯ll give the instructions.

1032

(CAR HONKING)

1033
01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:29.245
Just a moment,please.

1034
01:14:31.592 --> 01:14:35.130
Mrs.Danvers,I intend to say nothing to Mr.de Winter

1035
01:14:35.304 --> 01:14:37.215
about Mr.Favell¡¯s visit.

1036
01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:40.974
In fact,I prefer to forget everything that happened this afternoon.

1037
01:14:50.027 --> 01:14:52.188
Maxim,Maxim,you¡¯ve been gone all day.

1038
01:14:52.363 --> 01:14:54.024
You¡¯re choking me.

1039
01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:56.572
Well,well,well,what have you been doing with yourself?

1040
01:14:56.742 --> 01:14:59.233
-I¡¯ve been thinking. -What did you want to do that for?

1041
01:14:59.412 --> 01:15:01.448
Come in here and I¡¯ll tell you.

1042
01:15:03.416 --> 01:15:07.785
Darling,could we have a costume ball just as you used to?

1043
01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:11.996
Now what put that into your mind?

1044
01:15:12.174 --> 01:15:13.334
Has Beatrice been at you?

1045
01:15:13.509 --> 01:15:15.841
No,no,but I feel that we ought to do something

1046
01:15:16.012 --> 01:15:19.550
to make people feel that Manderley is just the name as it always was.

1047
01:15:22.184 --> 01:15:24.516
Ok,please,darling,could we?

1048
01:15:27.148 --> 01:15:29.230
You don¡¯t know what it would mean,you know.

1049
01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:32.733
You¡¯d have to be hostess to hundreds of people,all the county.

1050
01:15:33.529 --> 01:15:35.440
And a lot of young people would come up from London,

1051
01:15:35.614 --> 01:15:38.572
-and turn the house into a nightclub. -Oh,yes. But I want to. Please.

1052
01:15:38.743 --> 01:15:41.530
I¡¯ve never been to a large party,but I could learn what to do.

1053
01:15:41.704 --> 01:15:44.616
And I promise you,you wouldn¡¯t be ashamed of me.

1054
01:15:53.841 --> 01:15:55.456
All right,if you think you¡¯d enjoy it.

1055
01:15:55.634 --> 01:15:57.374
You¡¯d better get Mrs.Danvers to help you out,won¡¯t you?

1056
01:15:57.553 --> 01:16:00.966
No,so.I don¡¯t need Mrs.Danvers to help me. I can do it myself.

1057
01:16:01.891 --> 01:16:03.506
All right,my sweet.

1058
01:16:03.684 --> 01:16:05.800
Thank you,darling.Thank you.

1059
01:16:07.563 --> 01:16:09.053
-What¡¯ll you go as? -I never dress up.

1060
01:16:09.231 --> 01:16:11.222
That¡¯s the one privilege I claim as the host.

1061
01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.766
What will you be? Alice in Wonderland,with that ribbon around your hair?

1062
01:16:13.944 --> 01:16:14.899
No,I won¡¯t tell you.

1063
01:16:15.071 --> 01:16:18.563
I¡¯ll design a costume all by myself and give you the surprise of your life.

1064

(KNOCK AT DOOR)

1065
01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:37.256
Come in.

1066
01:16:41.764 --> 01:16:43.925
Robert found these sketches in the library,madam.

1067
01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:46.933
-Did you intend throwing them away? -Yes,Mrs.Danvers,I did.

1068
01:16:47.103 --> 01:16:50.266
They were just some ideas I was sketching for my costume for the ball.

1069
01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:52.430
Hasn¡¯t Mr.de Winter suggested anything?

1070
01:16:52.608 --> 01:16:55.645
No,I want to surprise him. I don¡¯t want him to know anything about it.

1071
01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:58.436
I merely thought that you might find a costume

1072
01:16:58.614 --> 01:17:00.775
among the family portraits that would suit you.

1073
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:04.158
Oh,you mean those at the top of the stairs?I¡¯ll go and look at them.

1074
01:17:11.502 --> 01:17:14.915
This one,for instance. Might have been designed for you.

1075
01:17:15.589 --> 01:17:18.001
I¡¯m sure you could have it copied.

1076
01:17:18.217 --> 01:17:21.960
I¡¯ve heard Mr.de Winter say that this is his favorite of all the paintings.

1077
01:17:22.263 --> 01:17:24.720
It¡¯s Lady Caroline de Winter,one of his ancestors.

1078
01:17:25.266 --> 01:17:29.305
Oh,well,that¡¯s a splendid idea,Mrs.Danvers.I¡¯m very grateful.

Excuse me,sir,are you supposed to be a schoolmaster?

1081
01:18:03.554 --> 01:18:06.011
Oh,no. This is just my old cap and gown.

1082
01:18:06.182 --> 01:18:10.050
It certainly makes a very nice costume,sir.And economical,too.

1083

Yes. That was the idea.

Good evening,Robet. Not very good weather for the ball.

1085
01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:29.743
-No,sir. -Very misty on the way and very chilly.

1086
01:18:30.456 --> 01:18:33.368
Oh,this wig¡¯s so tight they ought to send an aspirin with it.

Where¡¯s the child?

1094
01:18:47.723 --> 01:18:48.883
Well,she¡¯s keeping her costume a terrific secret.

1095
01:18:49.058 --> 01:18:50.218
Wouldn¡¯t even let me into her room.

Oh,lovely.

1097
01:18:53.145 --> 01:18:55.010
I¡¯ll go up and give her a hand.

01:18:55.481 --> 01:18:58.143
-I could do with a drink. -Won¡¯t you catch a cold in that thing?

I watched you go down,just as I watched her a year ago.

1126
01:21:47.569 --> 01:21:49.901
Even in the same dress,you couldn¡¯t compare.

You knew it.

1128

You knew that she wore it,and yet you deliberately suggested I wear it.

Why do you hate me? What have I done to you that you should ever hate me so?

They¡¯re the same as those first weeks after she died.

01:29:27.362 --> 01:29:28.977
It wan all a lie.

1231
01:29:30.866 --> 01:29:33.323
I knew where Rebecca¡¯s body was,

1232
01:29:34.703 --> 01:29:37.570
lying on that cabin floor on the bottom of the sea.

1233
01:29:38.039 --> 01:29:40.030
How did you know,Maxim?

1234
01:29:40.667 --> 01:29:43.875
Because I put it there.

1235
01:29:52.387 --> 01:29:56.130
Will you look into my eyes and tell me that you love me now?

1236
01:30:08.695 --> 01:30:11.437
Yon see? I was right.

1237
01:30:13.825 --> 01:30:15.281
It¡¯s too late.

1238
01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:24.867
No,it¡¯s not too late. You¡¯re not to say that.

1239
01:30:25.045 --> 01:30:27.252
I love you more than anything in thu world.

1240
01:30:27.505 --> 01:30:30.417
-Oh,please,Maxim,kiss me,please. -No.

1241
01:30:31.301 --> 01:30:33.917
It¡¯s no use.It¡¯s too late.

1242
01:30:34.095 --> 01:30:37.633
Oh,we can¡¯t lose each other now. We must be together always.

1243
01:30:37.807 --> 01:30:39.138
No secrets,no shadows.

1244
01:30:39.309 --> 01:30:42.267
We may only have a few days,a few hours.

1245
01:30:42.437 --> 01:30:44.348
Maxim,why didn¡¯t you tell me before?

1246
01:30:44.522 --> 01:30:47.355
I nearly did sometimes,but you never seemed close enough.

1247
01:30:47.525 --> 01:30:50.892
How could we be close when I knew you were always thinking of Rebecca?

1248
01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:55.739
How could I even ask you to love me,when I knew you Rebecca still?

1249
01:30:57.077 --> 01:30:59.193
What are you talking about?

1250
01:31:00.246 --> 01:31:01.861
What do you mean?

1251
01:31:03.083 --> 01:31:06.541
Whenever you touched me,I knew you were comparing me with Rebecca.

1252
01:31:08.004 --> 01:31:12.373
Whenever you looked at we or spoke to me or walked with me in the garden,

1253
01:31:12.801 --> 01:31:17.135
I knew you were thinking,¡°This I did with Rebecca,and this,and this.¡±

1254
01:31:17.722 --> 01:31:19.087
Oh it¡¯s true,isn¡¯t it?

1255
01:31:19.307 --> 01:31:22.674
You thought I loved Rebecca? You thought that?

1256
01:31:26.147 --> 01:31:27.683
I hated her.

1257
01:31:40.161 --> 01:31:44.621
Oh,I was carried away by her,enchanted by her as everyone was.

1258
01:31:45.875 --> 01:31:49.993
And when I was married,I was told I was the luckiest man in the world.

1259
01:31:53.133 --> 01:31:56.546
She was so lovely,so accomplished,

1260
01:31:57.303 --> 01:31:58.668
so amusing.

1261
01:31:59.639 --> 01:32:03.131
¡°She¡¯s got the three things that really matter in a wife,¡±everyone said.

1262
01:32:03.351 --> 01:32:05.683
¡°Breeding brains and beauty.¡±

1263
01:32:06.021 --> 01:32:08.603
And I believed them. Completely.

1264
01:32:10.358 --> 01:32:13.395
But I never had a moment¡¯s happiness with her.

1265
01:32:13.653 --> 01:32:15.644
She was incapable of love

1266
01:32:16.031 --> 01:32:17.567
or tenderness

1267
01:32:18.450 --> 01:32:19.815
or decency.

1268
01:32:20.952 --> 01:32:23.443
You didn¡¯t love her. You didn¡¯t love her.

1269
01:32:24.956 --> 01:32:28.323
Do you remember that cliff where you first saw me in Monte Carlo?

1270
01:32:29.919 --> 01:32:32.501
Well. I went there with Rebecca on our honeymoon.

1271
01:32:33.006 --> 01:32:36.715
That¡¯s where I found out about her,four days after we were married.

1272
01:32:38.636 --> 01:32:42.549
She stood there laughing,her black hair blowing in the wind

1273
01:32:43.933 --> 01:32:47.801
and told me all about herself.Everything.

1274
01:32:50.565 --> 01:32:53.147
Things I¡¯ll never tell a living soul.

1275
01:32:54.194 --> 01:32:55.980
I wanted to kill her.

1276
01:32:56.279 --> 01:32:58.736
It would have been so easy.You remember the precipice?

1277
01:33:01.117 --> 01:33:04.735
I frightened you,didn¡¯t I? You thought I was mad.

1278
01:33:05.622 --> 01:33:08.705
Perhaps I was. Perhaps I am mad.

1279
01:33:10.085 --> 01:33:13.043
It wouldn¡¯t make for sanity,would it? Living with the devil?

1280
01:33:16.591 --> 01:33:18.798
¡°I¡¯ll make a bargain with you,¡± she said.

1281
01:33:18.968 --> 01:33:21.300
¡°You¡¯d look rather foolish trying to divorce me now

1282
01:33:21.471 --> 01:33:22.836
after four days of marriage,

1283
01:33:23.014 --> 01:33:24.629
so I¡¯ll play the part of a devoted wife,

1284
01:33:24.808 --> 01:33:26.344
mistress of your precious Manderley.

1285
01:33:26.518 --> 01:33:29.555
I¡¯ll make it the most famous showplace is England,if you like,

1286
01:33:29.729 --> 01:33:31.344
and people will visit us and envy us,

1287
01:33:31.523 --> 01:33:34.606
and say we¡¯re the luckiest,happiest couple is the courtry.

1288
01:33:36.986 --> 01:33:39.773
What a grand joke it¡¯ll be. What a triumph,¡±

1289
01:33:44.869 --> 01:33:48.737
I should never have accepted her dirty bargain,but I did.

1290
01:33:50.458 --> 01:33:54.576
I was younger then,and tremendously conscious of the family honor.

1291
01:33:56.422 --> 01:33:57.878
Family honor.

1292
01:33:59.008 --> 01:34:01.966
She knew that I'd sacrifice everything rather than stand up in a divorce court

1293
01:34:02.137 --> 01:34:05.049
and give her away,admit that our marriage was a rotten fraud.

1294
01:34:07.976 --> 01:34:09.807
You despise me,don¡¯t you?

1295
01:34:10.603 --> 01:34:11.638
As I despise myself

1296
01:34:11.813 --> 01:34:14.680
You can¡¯t understand what my feelings were,

1297
01:34:15.984 --> 01:34:16.973
can you?

1298
01:34:18.319 --> 01:34:20.731
Of course I can,darling. Of course I can.

1299
01:34:23.825 --> 01:34:27.317
Well,I kept the bargain and so did she,apparently.

1300
01:34:27.495 --> 01:34:29.907
Oh,she played the game brilliantly,

1301
01:34:30.165 --> 01:34:32.577
but after a while,she began to grow careless.

1302
01:34:32.834 --> 01:34:35.997
She took a flat in London,and she'd stay away for days at a time.

1303
01:34:36.337 --> 01:34:38.828
Then she started to bring her friends down here.

1304
01:34:39.174 --> 01:34:40.880
I warned her,but she shrugged her shoulders.

1305
01:34:41.050 --> 01:34:43.257
¡°What¡¯s it got to do with you?¡± she said.

1306
01:34:43.845 --> 01:34:45.756
She even started on Frank.

1307
01:34:46.347 --> 01:34:47.962
Poor,faithful Frank.

1308
01:34:48.892 --> 01:34:52.680
Then there was a cousin of hers,a man named Favell.

1309
01:34:53.146 --> 01:34:55.853
Yes. I know him. He came the day you went to London.

1310
01:34:57.317 --> 01:34:58.853
Why didn¡¯t you tell me?

1311
01:34:59.027 --> 01:35:00.688
I didn¡¯t like to.

1312
01:35:01.279 --> 01:35:03.770
I thought it would remind you of Rebecca.

1313
01:35:04.574 --> 01:35:05.905
Remind me?

1314
01:35:07.785 --> 01:35:09.776
As if I needed reminding.

1315
01:35:11.372 --> 01:35:14.034
Favell used to visit her here in this cottage.

1316
01:35:14.375 --> 01:35:16.616
I found out about it,and I warmed her that if he come here again,

1317
01:35:16.794 --> 01:35:18.250
I¡¯d shoot them both.

1318
01:35:20.256 --> 01:35:23.794
One night,when I found she had come back quietly from London,

1319
01:35:24.052 --> 01:35:26.213
I thought that Favell was with her,

1320
01:35:26.429 --> 01:35:28.761
and I knew then that I couldn¡¯t stand

1321
01:35:28.932 --> 01:35:32.140
this life of filth and deceit any longer.

1322
01:35:32.352 --> 01:35:36.140
I decided to come down here and have it out with both of them.

1323
01:35:38.775 --> 01:35:40.265
But she was alone.

1324
01:35:40.443 --> 01:35:43.526
She was expecting Favell,but he hadn¡¯t come.

1325
01:35:44.197 --> 01:35:48.110
She was lying on the divan,a large tray of cigarette stubs beside her.

1326
01:35:49.911 --> 01:35:51.776
She looked ill,queer.

1327
01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:55.993
Suddenly,she got up,started to walk toward me.

1328
01:35:58.002 --> 01:36:00.744
¡°When I have a child,¡±she said,¡°neither you nor anyone else

1329
01:36:00.922 --> 01:36:02.878
could ever prove it wasn¡¯t yours.

1330
01:36:03.633 --> 01:36:04.918
You would like to have an heir,wouldn¡¯t you,Max,

1331
01:36:05.093 --> 01:36:06.799
for your precious Manderley?¡±

1332
01:36:07.512 --> 01:36:09.002
Then she started to laugh.

1333
01:36:09.597 --> 01:36:12.555
¡°How funny.How supremely,wonderfully funny.

1334
01:36:13.059 --> 01:36:16.176
I¡¯ll be the perfect mother,just as I¡¯ve been the perfect wife.

1335
01:36:16.354 --> 01:36:18.094
No one will ever know.

1336
01:36:18.398 --> 01:36:20.514
It ought to give you the thrill of your life,Max,

1337
01:36:20.692 --> 01:36:23.399
to watch my son grow bigger day by day

1338
01:36:23.569 --> 01:36:26.527
and to know that when you die,Manderley will be his.¡±

1339
01:36:28.616 --> 01:36:30.857
She was face to face with me.

1340
01:36:31.286 --> 01:36:34.870
One hand is her pocket,the other holding a cigarette.

1341
01:36:36.291 --> 01:36:37.872
She was smiling.

1342
01:36:38.918 --> 01:36:40.283
¡°Well,Max?

1343
01:36:40.753 --> 01:36:43.290
What are you going to do about it?

1344
01:36:44.257 --> 01:36:46.464
Aren¡¯t you going to kill me?¡±

1345
01:36:48.970 --> 01:36:51.461
I suppose I went mad for a moment.

1346
01:36:52.682 --> 01:36:54.593
I must have struck her.

1347
01:36:58.730 --> 01:37:00.686
She stood staring at me.

1348
01:37:02.317 --> 01:37:04.524
She looked almost triumphant.

1349
01:37:06.195 --> 01:37:09.687
Then she started toward me again. Smiling.

1350
01:37:10.908 --> 01:37:13.320
Suddenly,she stumbled and fell.

1351
01:37:18.791 --> 01:37:20.031
When I looked down,

1352
01:37:20.209 --> 01:37:23.121
ages afterwards,it seemed,she was lying on the floor.

1353
01:37:23.296 --> 01:37:27.665
She had struck her head on a heavy piece of ship¡¯s tackle.

1354
01:37:30.178 --> 01:37:33.261
I rememder wondering why she was still smilling.

1355
01:37:34.849 --> 01:37:36.510
Then I realized she was dead.

1356
01:37:36.684 --> 01:37:39.676
But you didn¡¯t kill her.It was an accident.

1357
01:37:40.271 --> 01:37:42.057
Who would believe me?

1358
01:37:42.774 --> 01:37:44.310
I lost my head.

1359
01:37:44.692 --> 01:37:47.684
I just knew I had to do something. Anything.

1360
01:37:48.863 --> 01:37:51.195
I carried her out to the boat.

1361
01:37:51.866 --> 01:37:54.448
It was very dark. There was no moon.

1362
01:37:55.536 --> 01:37:56.946
I put her in the cabin.

1363
01:37:57.872 --> 01:38:00.158
When the boat seemed a safe distance from the shore,I took a spike,

1364
01:38:00.333 --> 01:38:03.200
and drove it again and again through the planking of the hull.

1365
01:38:03.378 --> 01:38:06.370
I had opened up the seacocks and the water began to come in fast.

1366
01:38:06.839 --> 01:38:09.205
I climbed over into the dinghy and pulled away.

1367
01:38:10.468 --> 01:38:12.584
I saw the boat heel over

1368
01:38:14.013 --> 01:38:15.253
and sink.

1369
01:38:17.058 --> 01:38:19.219
I pulled back into the cove.

1370
01:38:20.895 --> 01:38:22.601
It started raining.

1371
01:38:23.022 --> 01:38:27.641
-Maxim,does anyone else know of this? -No. No one except you and me.

1372
01:38:29.987 --> 01:38:31.727
We must explain it.

1373
01:38:32.115 --> 01:38:35.073
It¡¯s got to be the body of someone you¡¯ve never seen before.

1374
01:38:35.243 --> 01:38:39.236
No,they¡¯re bound to know her. Her rings,bracelets she always wore.

1375
01:38:40.248 --> 01:38:44.412
They¡¯ll identify her body then they¡¯ll remember the other woman.

1376
01:38:45.753 --> 01:38:48.335
The other woman buried in the crypt.

1377
01:38:48.881 --> 01:38:50.667
If they find out it was Rebecca,

1378
01:38:50.842 --> 01:38:53.584
you must simply say you made a mistake about the other body.

1379
01:38:53.886 --> 01:38:55.296
That the day you went to Edgecombe,you were ill,

1380
01:38:55.471 --> 01:38:56.927
you didn¡¯t know what you were doind.

1381
01:38:57.098 --> 01:38:59.589
Rebecca¡¯s dead.That¡¯s what we¡¯ve got to rememdar.Rebecca¡¯s dead.

1382
01:38:59.767 --> 01:39:03.430
She can't speak. She can't bear witness. She can't harm you anymore.

1383
01:39:03.604 --> 01:39:06.516
We¡¯re the only two people in the worlh thet know,Maxiw,yon and I.

1384
01:39:06.691 --> 01:39:09.774
I'd told you once that I¡¯d done a selfish thing in marrying you.

1385
01:39:10.736 --> 01:39:13.318
You can understand now what I meant.

1386
01:39:14.031 --> 01:39:16.113
I¡¯ve loved you,my darling.

1387
01:39:16.701 --> 01:39:18.692
I shall always love you,

1388
01:39:19.245 --> 01:39:20.951
but I¡¯ve known all along

1389
01:39:21.622 --> 01:39:23.613
that Rebecca would win in the end.

1390
01:39:23.791 --> 01:39:25.952
No. no. She hasn't won.

1391
01:39:26.294 --> 01:39:29.081
No matter what happens now,she hasn¡¯t won.

Hello. Frank.

Hello,Frank. Yes.

01:39:50.651 --> 01:39:52.391
Who? Colonel Julyan?

1397
01:39:54.030 --> 01:39:57.614
Yes. Tell him I¡¯ll meet him there as soon as I possibly can.

1398
01:39:57.950 --> 01:39:59.030
What?

1399
01:40:01.162 --> 01:40:02.151
Well...

1400
01:40:02.830 --> 01:40:06.448
Say we could talk about that when we¡¯re sure about the matter.

1401
01:40:09.962 --> 01:40:11.668
What¡¯s happened?

1402
01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:14.671
Colonel Julyan called.

1403
01:40:15.134 --> 01:40:17.500
He¡¯s the chief constable of the county.

1404
01:40:17.678 --> 01:40:20.385
He¡¯s been asked by the police to go to the mortuary.

1405
01:40:21.057 --> 01:40:24.140
He wanted to know if I could possibly have made a mistake

1406
01:40:25.186 --> 01:40:26.676
about that other body.

1407
01:40:47.208 --> 01:40:51.247
Well,Colonel Julyan,apparently I did make a mistake about that other body.

1408
01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:53.456
Tha mistake was natural under the circumstances.

1409
01:40:53.631 --> 01:40:57.374
-Besides,you weren¡¯t well at the time. -That¡¯s nonsense. I was perfectly well.

1410
01:40:57.718 --> 01:41:01.586
Don¡¯t let it worry you,Maxim. Nobody can blame you for making a mistake.

1411
01:41:02.723 --> 01:41:05.806
The pity is,you¡¯ve got to go through the same thing all over again.

1412
01:41:05.977 --> 01:41:07.217
What do you mean?

1413
01:41:07.395 --> 01:41:11.138
There¡¯ll have to be another inquest,of course. Same formality and red tape.

1414
01:41:12.066 --> 01:41:15.479
Wish you could be spared the publicity of it,but I¡¯m afraid that's impossible.

1415
01:41:15.653 --> 01:41:17.814
Oh,yes,publicity.

1416
01:41:18.239 --> 01:41:22.482
I suppose Mrs.de Winter went below for something and a squall hit the boat

1417
01:41:22.868 --> 01:41:24.574
with nobody at the helm.

1418
01:41:24.745 --> 01:41:27.111
I imagine that¡¯s about the solution now,don¡¯t you think so,Crawley?

1419
01:41:27.290 --> 01:41:29.906
Oh,yes. Probably the door jammed,and she couldn't get on deck again.

1420
01:41:30.084 --> 01:41:31.039
Yeah.

1421
01:41:31.210 --> 01:41:35.078
Tabb,the boat builder,will undoubtedly come to some such conclusion.

1422
01:41:35.256 --> 01:41:37.463
Why,what would he know about it?

1423
01:41:37.967 --> 01:41:41.835
Well,he¡¯s examining the boat now. Purely as a matter of routine,you know.

1424
01:41:42.388 --> 01:41:45.846
I¡¯ll be at the inquest tomorrow,Maxim,quite unofficially,you know.

1425
01:41:46.142 --> 01:41:48.975
We must get together for a game of golf when it¡¯s all over,eh?

1426
01:41:49.145 --> 01:41:50.134
Bys-bye.

1427
01:42:03.909 --> 01:42:06.321
I have the evening papers,madam. Would you care to see them?

1428
01:42:06.495 --> 01:42:07.484
Oh,no thank you,Frith,

1429
01:42:07.663 --> 01:42:10.200
and I prefer that Mr.de Winter weren¡¯t troubled with them,either.

1430
01:42:10.374 --> 01:42:13.958
I understand,madaw. Permit me to say that we¡¯re all most distressed outside.

1431
01:42:14.128 --> 01:42:15.288
Thank you,Frith.

1432
01:42:15.463 --> 01:42:18.455
I¡¯m afraid the news has been a great shock to Mrs. Danvers.

1433
01:42:18.633 --> 01:42:20.498
Yes,I rather expected it would be.

1434
01:42:20.676 --> 01:42:23.588
It seems there¡¯s to be a coroner¡¯s inquest,madam?

1435
01:42:23.763 --> 01:42:26.220
Yes,Frith.It¡¯s purely a formality

1436
01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:28.005
Of course,madam. I...

1437
01:42:28.184 --> 01:42:31.551
I wanted to say that if any of us might be required to give avidence,

1438
01:42:31.729 --> 01:42:34.892
I should be only too pleased to do anything that might help the family.

1439
01:42:35.066 --> 01:42:36.647
Oh,thank you,Frith,why,I...

1440
01:42:36.817 --> 01:42:39.399
I¡¯m sure Mr.de Winter will be very happy to hear it.

1441
01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:42.311
But I don¡¯t think anything will be necessary.

1442
01:42:55.378 --> 01:42:56.538
Maxim.

1443
01:42:58.756 --> 01:43:00.292
Hello,darling.

1444
01:43:01.592 --> 01:43:04.675
Oh,Maxim,I¡¯m worried about what you¡¯ll do at the inquest tomorrow.

1445
01:43:05.096 --> 01:43:06.711
What do you mean?

1446
01:43:07.473 --> 01:43:09.054
You won¡¯t lose your temper,will you?

1447
01:43:09.225 --> 01:43:11.932
Promise me that they won¡¯t make you angry.

1448
01:43:12.103 --> 01:43:14.845
All right,darling.I promise.

1449
01:43:15.022 --> 01:43:18.480
No matter what he asks you,you won¡¯t lose your head?

1450
01:43:18.734 --> 01:43:20.395
Don¡¯t worry,dear.

1451
01:43:21.070 --> 01:43:23.186
They can¡¯t do anything at once,can they?

1452
01:43:23.364 --> 01:43:25.070
No.

1453
01:43:25.741 --> 01:43:27.481
Then we¡¯ve a little time left to be together.

1454
01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:28.820
Yes.

1455
01:43:30.287 --> 01:43:34.371
-I want to go to the inquest with you. -I¡¯d rather you didn¡¯t,darling.

1456
01:43:34.709 --> 01:43:36.825
But I can't wait here alone.

1457
01:43:37.002 --> 01:43:39.789
I promise you,I won¡¯t be any trouble to you.

1458
01:43:40.881 --> 01:43:43.042
And I must be near you so that no matter what happens,

1459
01:43:43.217 --> 01:43:46.084
we won¡¯t be separated for a moment.

1460
01:43:47.221 --> 01:43:48.836
All right,dear.

1461
01:43:50.725 --> 01:43:53.808
I don¡¯t mind this whole thing except for you.

1462
01:43:54.437 --> 01:43:57.053
I can't forget what it¡¯s done to you.

1463
01:43:57.565 --> 01:44:00.978
I¡¯ve been thinking of nothing else since it happened.

1464
01:44:04.530 --> 01:44:06.236
It¡¯s gone forever,

1465
01:44:07.074 --> 01:44:10.987
that funny,young,lost look I loved.

1466
01:44:12.204 --> 01:44:14.195
It won¡¯t ever come back.

1467
01:44:15.082 --> 01:44:18.165
I killed that when I told you about Rebecca.

1468
01:44:18.961 --> 01:44:20.292
It¡¯s gone.

1469
01:44:21.297 --> 01:44:25.666
In a few hours,you¡¯ve grown so much older.

1470

(SOBBING)Oh,Maxim Maxim.

01:44:56.457 --> 01:44:58.368
Black Jack Brady was his name.

1472
01:44:58.542 --> 01:45:01.158
The most important arrest I ever made.

1473
01:45:01.337 --> 01:45:03.328
It must have been about two years ago now.

1474
01:45:03.506 --> 01:45:06.748
Of course,there was no doubt about it. He was hung a month after I caught him.

1475
01:45:07.176 --> 01:45:08.791

1478
01:45:15.476 --> 01:45:17.558
-She¡¯s gone. -Yes,we know that.

1479
01:45:18.103 --> 01:45:21.937
-She went in the sea. The sea got her. -That's right.That¡¯s right.

1480
01:45:22.107 --> 01:45:24.598
Now we want you to tell us whether you were on the shore

1481
01:45:24.777 --> 01:45:26.859
-that last night she went sailing. -Eh?

1482
01:45:27.321 --> 01:45:31.655
Were you on the shore that last sight she went ou,when she didn't come back?

1483
01:45:32.243 --> 01:45:36.657
I didn¡¯t see nothing. I don¡¯t want to go to the asylum.

1484
01:45:36.831 --> 01:45:38.662
Them cruel folks there.

1485
01:45:38.833 --> 01:45:40.744
Now,nobody¡¯s going to send you to the asylum.

1486
01:45:40.918 --> 01:45:43.830
All we want you to do is tell us what you saw.

1487
01:45:44.004 --> 01:45:45.665
I didn¡¯t see nothing.

1488
01:45:45.881 --> 01:45:46.961
CORONER: Come,come.

1489
01:45:47.132 --> 01:45:50.920
Did you see Mrs.de Winter get into her boat that last night?

1490
01:45:51.262 --> 01:45:53.048
I don¡¯t know nothing.

1491
01:45:53.472 --> 01:45:55.884
I don¡¯t want to go to the asylum.

1492
01:45:59.019 --> 01:46:00.509
Very well.You may go.

1493

I do,so help me God.

The late Mrs.de Winter used to send her boat

1499
01:46:20.624 --> 01:46:23.366
-to your shipyard for reconditioning. -That¡¯s right,sir.

1500
01:46:23.544 --> 01:46:24.829
CORONER: Can you remember any occasion

1501
01:46:25.004 --> 01:46:26.869
when she had any sort of accident with the boat?

1502
01:46:27.047 --> 01:46:29.959
TABB: No,sir. I often said Mrs.de Winter was a born sailor.

1503
01:46:30.134 --> 01:46:32.591
Now,when Mrs.de Winter went below,as is supposed,

1504
01:46:32.761 --> 01:46:34.752
and a sudden gust of wind came down,

1505
01:46:34.930 --> 01:46:37.262
that would be enough to capsize the boat,wouldn¡¯t it?

1506
01:46:37.433 --> 01:46:41.051
Excuse we,sir. But there's a little more to it than that.

1507
01:46:41.437 --> 01:46:44.520
-What do you mean,Mr.Tabb? -I mean,sir,the seacocks.

1508
01:46:44.690 --> 01:46:45.975
What are the seacocks?

1509
01:46:46.150 --> 01:46:47.139
Sea...

1510
01:46:48.611 --> 01:46:51.819
The seacocks are the valves to drain out the boat.

1511
01:46:52.406 --> 01:46:55.739
They¡¯re always kept tight closed when you¡¯re afloat.

1512
01:46:56.160 --> 01:46:57.240
Yes?

1513
01:46:57.745 --> 01:47:01.329
Well,yesterday,when I examined that boat,I found they¡¯d been opened.

1514
01:47:01.540 --> 01:47:03.201
Whet could be the reason for that?

1515
01:47:03.375 --> 01:47:06.742
Just this,that¡¯s what flooded the boat and sunk her.

1516
01:47:08.172 --> 01:47:11.881
Are you implying that boat never capsized at all?

1517
01:47:12.259 --> 01:47:15.843
I know it¡¯s a terrible thing to say,sir,but in my opinion,

1518
01:47:16.013 --> 01:47:17.002
she was scuttled.

1519
01:47:20.643 --> 01:47:23.601
-And there¡¯s them holes. -What holes?

1520
01:47:24.188 --> 01:47:26.804
-Is her planking. -What are you talking about?

1521
01:47:27.274 --> 01:47:30.516
Of course,that boat¡¯s been underwater for over a year,

1522
01:47:30.694 --> 01:47:33.606
and the tide¡¯s been knocking her against the ridge.

1523
01:47:33.781 --> 01:47:38.366
But it seemed to me them holes looked as if she¡¯d made them from the inside.

1524
01:47:39.787 --> 01:47:42.028
Then you believe she must have done it deliberately.

1525
01:47:42.206 --> 01:47:46.165
Couldn¡¯t have been no accident not with her knowledge of boats.

1526
01:47:48.754 --> 01:47:50.585
You know the former Mrs.de Winter very well,I believe?

1527
01:47:50.756 --> 01:47:51.666
Oh,yes.

1528
01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:53.956
Would you have believed her capable of suicide?

1529
01:47:54.677 --> 01:47:58.135
No.Frankly,I would not. But you never can tell.

1530
01:47:59.306 --> 01:48:01.513
You way stand down,Mr.Tabb.

1531

01:48:13.487 --> 01:48:15.694
Sorry to drag you back for furthur questioning,Mr.de Winter.

1535
01:48:15.864 --> 01:48:17.195
But you¡¯ve heard the statement of Mr.Tabb.

1536
01:48:17.366 --> 01:48:19.072
I wonder if you can help us in any way.

1537
01:48:19.243 --> 01:48:20.198
I¡¯m afraid not.

1538
01:48:20.369 --> 01:48:21.984
Can you think of any reason why there should be holes

1539
01:48:22.162 --> 01:48:24.323
in the planking of the late Mrs.de Winter¡¯s boat?

1540
01:48:24.498 --> 01:48:26.910
Well,of course I can't think of any reason.

1541
01:48:27.167 --> 01:48:29.283
Has anyone ever discussed these holes with you before?

1542
01:48:29.461 --> 01:48:31.292
Well,since the boat has been at the bottom of the ocean,

1543
01:48:31.463 --> 01:48:33.044
I scarcely think that likely.

(PEOPLE LAUGHING)

1545
01:48:34.341 --> 01:48:36.332
Mr.be Winter,I want you to believe we all feel very deeply

1546
01:48:36.510 --> 01:48:37.499
for you in this matter.

1547
01:48:37.678 --> 01:48:39.384
But you must remember that I don¡¯t conduct this inquiry

1548
01:48:39.555 --> 01:48:40.510
for my own amusement.

1549
01:48:40.681 --> 01:48:42.546
-That¡¯s rather obvious,isn¡¯t it? -I hope that it is.

1550
01:48:42.725 --> 01:48:44.261
Well,since she went sailing alone,

1551
01:48:44.435 --> 01:48:46.346
are we to believe that she drove those doles herself?

1552
01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:48.056
You may believe what you like.

1553
01:48:48.230 --> 01:48:51.063
Can you enlighten us as to why Mrs.de Winter should have wanted

1554
01:48:51.233 --> 01:48:52.598
to end her own life?

1555
01:48:52.776 --> 01:48:54.232
I know of no reason whatever.

1556
01:48:54.403 --> 01:48:57.145
Mr.de Winter,however painful it may be,

1557
01:48:57.322 --> 01:48:59.028
I have to ask you a very personal question.

1558
01:48:59.491 --> 01:49:03.825
Were relations between you and the late Mrs.de Winter perfectly happy?

1559
01:49:04.830 --> 01:49:08.448
Were relations between you and the late Mrs.be Winter perfectly happy?

1560
01:49:08.625 --> 01:49:12.117
I won¡¯t stand this any longer! You might as well know now...

1562
01:49:13.464 --> 01:49:14.829
CORONER:We¡¯ll adjourn till after lunch.

1563
01:49:15.007 --> 01:49:18.625
Mr.de Winter,I presume you¡¯ll be available for us then?

1564
01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:21.711
I told you,you should have had some breakfast.

1565
01:49:21.889 --> 01:49:24.301
You¡¯re hungry. That¡¯s what¡¯s the matter with you.

1566
01:49:29.396 --> 01:49:31.432
Mr.Frith thought you might like to have some lunch from the house,

1567
01:49:31.607 --> 01:49:32.596
and sent me with it.

1568
01:49:32.775 --> 01:49:34.390
No,that¡¯s fine. Pull around the corner.

1569
01:49:34.568 --> 01:49:36.229
Very good,sir.

1570
01:49:45.746 --> 01:49:47.486
Awfully foolish of me,fainting like that.

1571
01:49:47.664 --> 01:49:50.406
Nonsense. If you hadn¡¯t fainted like that,I¡¯d have really lost my temper.

1572
01:49:50.584 --> 01:49:52.324
Daring,please be careful.

1573
01:49:59.676 --> 01:50:02.292
Darling,wait here a few moments. I¡¯ll see if I can old Frank.

1574
01:50:02.471 --> 01:50:04.211
Of course,darling. Don¡¯t worry about me.I¡¯ll be all right.

1575
01:50:04.389 --> 01:50:05.378
Sure?

1576
01:50:07.810 --> 01:50:11.143
Here,try a spot of this. Do you good.

1577
01:50:11.313 --> 01:50:12.644
Thank you.

1578
01:50:15.609 --> 01:50:18.100
-Are you all right? -Yes,of course.

1579
01:50:18.862 --> 01:50:21.194
-I won¡¯t be long. -Right you are.

1580
01:50:24.493 --> 01:50:25.653
Hello.

1581
01:50:26.453 --> 01:50:29.286
And how does the bride find herself today?

1582
01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:35.083
I say,marriage with Max is not exactly a bed of roses,is it?

1583
01:50:35.254 --> 01:50:37.119
I think you¡¯d better go before Maxim gets back.

1584
01:50:37.297 --> 01:50:40.789
Oh,jealous,in he? Well,I can¡¯t say I blame him.

1585
01:50:40.968 --> 01:50:43.675
But you don¡¯t think I¡¯m the big bad wolf,do you?

1586
01:50:43.846 --> 01:50:46.713
I¡¯m not,you know.I¡¯m a perfectly ordinary,harmless bloke.

1587
01:50:47.015 --> 01:50:51.133
And I think you¡¯re behaving splendidly over all this. Perfectly splendidly.

1588
01:50:52.229 --> 01:50:55.471
You know,you¡¯ve grown up a bit since I last saw you. It's no wonder...

1589
01:50:55.649 --> 01:50:57.230
What do you want,Favell?

1590
01:50:57.401 --> 01:51:00.734
Oh,hello,Max. Things are going pretty well for you,aren't they?

1591
01:51:00.904 --> 01:51:02.485
Better than you ever expected.

1592
01:51:02.656 --> 01:51:05.489
I was rather worried about you at first. That's why I came down to the inquest.

1593
01:51:05.659 --> 01:51:07.024
Well,I'm touched by your solicitude.

1594
01:51:07.202 --> 01:51:09.818
But if you don't mind,we¡¯d rather like to have our lunch.

1595
01:51:09.997 --> 01:51:13.990
Lunch? I say,what a jolly idea. Rather like a picnic,isn¡¯t it?

1596
01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:17.827
I¡¯m so sorry. Do you mind if I put this there?

1597
01:51:18.005 --> 01:51:21.873
You know,Max,old boy,I really think I ought to talk things over with you.

1598
01:51:22.050 --> 01:51:23.915
Talk what things over?

1599
01:51:24.386 --> 01:51:27.503
Well,those holes in the planking,for one thing.

1600
01:51:27.723 --> 01:51:30.089
Those holes that were drilled from the inside.

1601
01:51:30.267 --> 01:51:31.928
-Oh,Mullen? -Yes,sir?

1602
01:51:32.769 --> 01:51:35.260
Would you,like a good fellow,have my car filled with petrol?

1603
01:51:35.439 --> 01:51:36.724
-It¡¯s almost empty. -Very good,sir.

1604
01:51:36.899 --> 01:51:39.356
-And,Mullen,close the door,will you? -Yes,sir.

1605
01:51:40.819 --> 01:51:42.400
Does this bother you?

1606
01:51:50.162 --> 01:51:52.869
You know,old boy,I buys a strong feeling that before the day¡¯s out,

1607
01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:56.407
somebody¡¯s going to make use of that rather expressive,

1608
01:51:56.585 --> 01:51:59.702
though somewhat old-fashioned term,¡°foul play.¡±

1609
01:52:01.381 --> 01:52:03.588
Am I boring you with all this?

1610
01:52:04.509 --> 01:52:05.544
No?

1611
01:52:07.262 --> 01:52:11.221
Good.Well,you see,Max,I find myself in a rather awkward position.

1612
01:52:11.558 --> 01:52:15.221
You¡¯ve only got to read this note to understand.It¡¯s from Rebecca.

1613
01:52:15.395 --> 01:52:18.353
And,what¡¯s more,she had the foresight to put a date on it.

1614
01:52:19.858 --> 01:52:21.473
She wrote me the day she died.

1615
01:52:21.652 --> 01:52:23.984
Incidentally,I was at a party on that night

1616
01:52:24.154 --> 01:52:25.735
so I didn¡¯t get it until the next day.

1617
01:52:25.906 --> 01:52:27.988
And what makes you think that note would interest me?

1618
01:52:28.158 --> 01:52:29.819
Oh,I¡¯m not gonna bother you with the contents now.

1619
01:52:29.993 --> 01:52:32.154
But I can assure you that it is not the note of a woman

1620
01:52:32.329 --> 01:52:35.241
who intends to drown herself that same night.

1621
01:52:38.585 --> 01:52:42.419
By the way,what do you do with old bones? Bury them?

1622
01:52:43.882 --> 01:52:46.168
However,for the time being...

1623
01:52:48.387 --> 01:52:51.220
You know,Max,I¡¯m getting fed up with my job as a motorcar salesman.

1624
01:52:51.390 --> 01:52:53.130
I don¡¯t know if you¡¯ve ever experienced the feeling

1625
01:52:53.308 --> 01:52:55.924
of driving an expensive motorcar which isn¡¯t your own?

1626
01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:58.727
But it can be very,very exasperating.

1627
01:52:58.897 --> 01:53:01.559
You know what I mean. You want to own the car yourself.

1628
01:53:01.733 --> 01:53:04.725
I oftan wonder what it would be like to ratire to the country.

1629
01:53:04.903 --> 01:53:08.111
Have a nice little place with a few acres of shooting.

1630
01:53:08.282 --> 01:53:09.897
I¡¯ve never figured out what it what it would cost a year,

1631
01:53:10.075 --> 01:53:11.986
but I¡¯d like to talk about it with you.

1632
01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:16.153
I¡¯d like to have your advice on how to live comfortably without hard work.

1633
01:53:17.749 --> 01:53:20.365
Hello,Favell. You looking for me,Maxim?

1634
01:53:20.669 --> 01:53:21.749
Yes.

1635
01:53:22.713 --> 01:53:25.546
Mr.Favell and I have a little business transaction on hand.

1636
01:53:25.716 --> 01:53:28.253
I think we had better conduct it over at the inn.

1637
01:53:28.969 --> 01:53:31.506
They may have a private room there.

1638
01:53:32.639 --> 01:53:34.379
Well,see you later.

1639
01:53:35.642 --> 01:53:38.679
Find Colonel Julyan. Tell him I want to see him immediately.

1640
01:53:39.021 --> 01:53:40.477
Come on.Favell.Let¡¯s go.

1641
01:53:45.902 --> 01:53:50.145
-Have you a private room,please? -Of course,sir. Through there,sir.

1642
01:53:53.869 --> 01:53:55.655
Hope this will do,Mr.de Winter.

1643
01:53:55.829 --> 01:53:58.070
Splendid.Splendid. Exactly like the Ritz.

1644
01:53:58.498 --> 01:53:59.578
Any orders,gents?

1645
01:53:59.750 --> 01:54:01.741
Yes. You might bring me a large brandy and soda.

1646
01:54:01.918 --> 01:54:05.502
How about you,Max? Have one on me. I feel I can afford to play host.

1647
01:54:05.672 --> 01:54:06.832
Thanks. I don¡¯t mind if I do.

1648
01:54:07.007 --> 01:54:08.292
Make it two,will you,like a good fellow?

1649
01:54:08.467 --> 01:54:10.298
-Very good,sir. -COLONEL JULYON:Where¡¯s Mr.de Winter?

1650
01:54:10.469 --> 01:54:12.755
PROPRIETOR: Through the other door,sir.

1651
01:54:12.929 --> 01:54:15.261
Colonel Jnlyan,this is Mr.Favell.

1652
01:54:16.391 --> 01:54:18.677
Oh,I know Colonel Jnlyan. We¡¯re old friends,aren¡¯t we?

1653
01:54:18.852 --> 01:54:20.763
Since you¡¯re old friends,I assume you also know

1654
01:54:20.937 --> 01:54:22.222
he¡¯s head of the police here.

1655
01:54:22.397 --> 01:54:25.184
He might be interested to hear your proposition. Tell him all about it.

1656
01:54:25.359 --> 01:54:27.725
I don't know what you mean. I merely said I hoped to give up selling cars

1657
01:54:27.903 --> 01:54:29.018
and retire into the country.

1658
01:54:29.196 --> 01:54:31.687
Actually,he offered to withhold a vital piece of evidence from the inquest

1659
01:54:31.865 --> 01:54:33.480
if I made it worth his while.

1660
01:54:33.658 --> 01:54:35.740
I only want to see justice done,Colonel.

1661
01:54:35.911 --> 01:54:38.653
Now,that boatbuilder¡¯s evidence suggested certain possible theories

1662
01:54:38.830 --> 01:54:41.663
concerning Rebecca¡¯s death. One of them,of course,is suicide.

1663
01:54:41.833 --> 01:54:43.824
Now I have a little note here which I consider

1664
01:54:44.002 --> 01:54:46.493
puts that possibility quite out of court.

1665
01:54:46.838 --> 01:54:48.453
Read it,Colonel.

1666
01:54:48.757 --> 01:54:50.088
¡°Jack,darling,

1667
01:54:50.258 --> 01:54:53.375
I¡¯ve just seen the doctor and I¡¯m going down to Manderley right away.

1668
01:54:53.553 --> 01:54:55.009
I shall be at the cottage all this evening

1669
01:54:55.180 --> 01:54:57.171
and shall leave the door open for you.

1670
01:54:57.349 --> 01:54:59.806
I have something terribly important to tell you.

1671
01:54:59.976 --> 01:55:00.886
Rebecca.¡±

1672
01:55:01.061 --> 01:55:02.426
Now,does that look like the note of a woman

1673
01:55:02.604 --> 01:55:04.515
who had made up her mind to kill herself?

1674
01:55:04.689 --> 01:55:06.054
And apart from that,do you mean to tell me

1675
01:55:06.233 --> 01:55:08.394
that if you wanted to commit suicide,you would go to all the trouble

1676
01:55:08.568 --> 01:55:11.059
of putting out to sea is a boat,and then take a hammer and chisel

1677
01:55:11.238 --> 01:55:13.945
and laboriously knock holes through the bottom of it?

1678
01:55:14.116 --> 01:55:16.482
Come,Colonel.As an officer of the law,

1679
01:55:16.660 --> 01:55:19.948
don¡¯t you feel there are some slight grounds for suspicion?

1680
01:55:20.122 --> 01:55:21.987
-Of murder? -What else?

1681
01:55:22.332 --> 01:55:25.574
You¡¯ve known Max a long time. So you know he¡¯s the old-fashioned type,

1682
01:55:25.752 --> 01:55:28.960
who¡¯d die to defend his honor,or who¡¯d kill for it.

1683
01:55:29.172 --> 01:55:31.333
It¡¯s blackmail,pure and simple.

1684
01:55:31.508 --> 01:55:33.794
Blackmail is not so pure,nor so simple.

1685
01:55:33.969 --> 01:55:36.301
It can bring a lot of trouble to a great many people.

1686
01:55:36.471 --> 01:55:39.634
And the blackmailer sometimes find himself in jail at the end of it.

1687
01:55:39.808 --> 01:55:42.595
Oh,I see.You¡¯re going to hold de Winter¡¯s hand through all this.

1688
01:55:42.769 --> 01:55:44.680
Just because he¡¯s the big noise around here

1689
01:55:44.855 --> 01:55:46.595
and he¡¯s actually permitted you to dine with him.

1690
01:55:46.773 --> 01:55:49.560
Be careful,Favell. You¡¯ve brought an eccusation of murder.

1691
01:55:49.734 --> 01:55:52.100
-Have you any witnesses? -I do have a witness.

1692
01:55:52.279 --> 01:55:53.610
It¡¯s that fellow,Ben.

1693
01:55:53.780 --> 01:55:55.941
If that stupid coroner hadn¡¯t been as much of a snob as you are,

1694
01:55:56.116 --> 01:55:58.107
he¡¯d have seen that half-wit wes hiding something.

1695
01:55:58.285 --> 01:55:59.274
And why should Ben do that?

1696
01:55:59.453 --> 01:56:00.863
Because we caught him once,Rebecca and I,

1697
01:56:01.037 --> 01:56:02.948
peering at us through the cottage window.

1698
01:56:03.123 --> 01:56:05.660
Rebecca threatened him with the asylum. That's why he was afraid to speak.

1699
01:56:05.834 --> 01:56:08.541
But he was always hanging about. He must have seen this whole thing.

1700
01:56:08.712 --> 01:56:11.419
It¡¯s ridiculous,even listening to all this.

1701
01:56:11.590 --> 01:56:14.457
You¡¯re like a little trade union,all of you,aren¡¯t you?

1702
01:56:14.634 --> 01:56:16.670
And if my guess in right,Cramley,

1703
01:56:16.845 --> 01:56:19.928
there¡¯s a bit of malice in your soul toward me,isn¡¯t there?

1704
01:56:20.098 --> 01:56:22.635
Crawley didn¡¯t have much success with Rebecca,

1705
01:56:22.809 --> 01:56:25.642
but he ought to have more luck this time.

1706
01:56:25.812 --> 01:56:28.679
And the bride will be grateful for your fraternal arm,Crawley,

1707
01:56:28.857 --> 01:56:31.644
in a week or so. Every time she faints,in fact.

1708
01:56:32.027 --> 01:56:34.439
-De Winter! -Maxiw,please!

1709
01:56:35.155 --> 01:56:36.941
That temper of yours will do you in yet,Max.

1710
01:56:37.115 --> 01:56:38.651
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

1711
01:56:41.620 --> 01:56:43.406
Excuse me,gentlemen.

1712
01:56:44.289 --> 01:56:46.746
-Now is there anything else? -Yes.

1713
01:56:47.834 --> 01:56:49.449
You might bring Mr.de Winter a sedative.

1714
01:56:49.628 --> 01:56:51.994
-No,no. Nothing at all. Just leave us. -Very good.

1715
01:56:55.383 --> 01:56:57.339
Now,Fevell,let¡¯s get this business over.

1716
01:56:57.511 --> 01:56:59.422
As you seew to have worked out the whole thing so carsfully,

1717
01:56:59.596 --> 01:57:01.086
perhaps you can provide us also with a motive.

1718
01:57:01.264 --> 01:57:03.721
I know you were going to bring that up,Colonel.

1719
01:57:03.892 --> 01:57:07.805
I¡¯ve read enough detective stories to know that there must always be a motive.

1720
01:57:07.979 --> 01:57:11.062
And if you¡¯ll all excuse me,I might supply that,too.

1721
01:57:12.692 --> 01:57:15.354
I wish you¡¯d go home. You ought not to he here through all this.

1722
01:57:15.529 --> 01:57:17.110
Please let me stay. Maxim.

1723
01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:19.487
Surely,Colonel Julyan,you¡¯re not going to allow this fellow to...

1724
01:57:19.658 --> 01:57:22.616
My opinion of Favell is no higher than yours,Crawley.

1725
01:57:22.786 --> 01:57:25.118
But in my official capacity,I have no altnrnative

1726
01:57:25.288 --> 01:57:28.530
But to pursue his accusations. I entirely agree with you,Colonel.

1727
01:57:28.708 --> 01:57:31.700
In matters as serious as this,we must make sure of every point

1728
01:57:31.878 --> 01:57:33.869
and explore every avenue.

1729
01:57:34.214 --> 01:57:38.127
And in fact,if I may coin a phrase,leave no stone unturned.

1730
01:57:38.552 --> 01:57:42.545
Here she is,the missing link,the witness who will help supply the motive.

1731
01:57:43.014 --> 01:57:45.926
Colonel Julyan Mrs.Danvers. I believe you know everyone else.

1732
01:57:46.101 --> 01:57:47.136
Won¡¯t you sit down?

1733
01:57:47.310 --> 01:57:49.517
No offense,Colonel,but I think I¡¯ll put this to Danny.

1734
01:57:49.688 --> 01:57:50.723
She¡¯ll understand it more easily.

1735
01:57:50.897 --> 01:57:53.229
Danny,who was Rebecca¡¯s doctor?

1736
01:57:53.567 --> 01:57:55.933
Mrs.de Winter always had Dr.McClean from the village.

1737
01:57:56.111 --> 01:57:59.353
Now,you heard. I said Rebecca¡¯s doctor in london.

1738
01:58:01.741 --> 01:58:02.856
I don¡¯t know anything about that.

1739
01:58:03.034 --> 01:58:05.446
Oh,don¡¯t give me that,Danny.You knew everything about Rebecca.

1740
01:58:05.620 --> 01:58:07.656
You knew she was in love with we,didn¡¯t you?

1741
01:58:07.831 --> 01:58:10.197
Surely you haven¡¯t forgotten the good times she and I used to have

1742
01:58:10.375 --> 01:58:12.582
down at the cottage on the beach.

1743
01:58:12.752 --> 01:58:14.834
She had a right to amuse herself,didn¡¯t she?

1744
01:58:15.005 --> 01:58:18.748
Love was a game to her. Only a game. It make her laugh,I tell you.

1745
01:58:18.925 --> 01:58:21.416
She used to sit and rock with laughter at the lot of you.

1746
01:58:21.595 --> 01:58:25.429
Can you think of why Mrs.de Winter should have taken her own life?

1747
01:58:25.849 --> 01:58:27.055
No,no. I refuse to believe it.

1748
01:58:27.225 --> 01:58:28.965
I knew everything about her and I won¡¯t believe it.

1749
01:58:29.144 --> 01:58:32.011
There. You see?It¡¯s impossible. She knows that an well as I do.

1750
01:58:32.188 --> 01:58:33.223
Now,listen to me,Danny.

1751
01:58:33.398 --> 01:58:34.888
We know that Rebecca went to a doctor in London

1752
01:58:35.066 --> 01:58:37.102
on the last day of her life. Who was it?

1753
01:58:37.319 --> 01:58:38.729
I don¡¯t know.

1754
01:58:39.112 --> 01:58:40.568
I understand,Danny

1755
01:58:40.739 --> 01:58:43.572
You think we¡¯re asking you to reveal secrets of Rebecca¡¯s life.

1756
01:58:43.742 --> 01:58:45.698
You¡¯re trying to defend her.But that's what I¡¯m doing.

1757
01:58:45.869 --> 01:58:48.451
I¡¯m trying to clear her name of the suspicion of suicide.

1758
01:58:48.622 --> 01:58:52.911
Mrs.Danvers,it has been suggested

1759
01:58:53.168 --> 01:58:54.954
that Mrs.de Winter was deliberately murdered.

1760
01:58:55.128 --> 01:58:56.709
There you buys it in e nutshell,Danny.

1761
01:58:56.880 --> 01:58:59.542
But there¡¯s one more thing you¡¯ll want to know,the name of the murderer.

1762
01:58:59.716 --> 01:59:02.799
It¡¯s a lovely name that rolls off the tongue so easily.

1763
01:59:02.969 --> 01:59:06.461
George Fortescue Maximilian de Winter.

1764
01:59:12.687 --> 01:59:14.302
There was a dactor.

1765
01:59:14.648 --> 01:59:16.639
Mrs.de Winter sometimes went to him privately.

1766
01:59:16.816 --> 01:59:18.898
She used to go to him even before she was married.

1767
01:59:19.069 --> 01:59:22.436
We don¡¯t want reminiscences,Danny.What was his name?

1768
01:59:30.330 --> 01:59:33.288
Dr.Baker. 165 Goldhawk Road,Shepherd¡¯s Bush.

1769
01:59:33.458 --> 01:59:36.165
There you are,Colonel. There¡¯s where you¡¯ll find your motive.

1770
01:59:36.336 --> 01:59:39.328
Go and question Dr.Baker. He¡¯ll tell you why Rebecca went to him.

1771
01:59:39.506 --> 01:59:42.043
To confirm the fact that she was going to have a child.

1772
01:59:42.217 --> 01:59:44.253
A sweet,curly-headed little child.

1773
01:59:44.427 --> 01:59:47.134
It isn¡¯t true. It isn¡¯t true. She would have told me.

1774
01:59:47.347 --> 01:59:49.679
She told Max about it. Max knew he wasn¡¯t the father.

1775
01:59:49.849 --> 01:59:53.307
So,like the gentleman of the old school that he is,he killed her.

1776
01:59:53.478 --> 01:59:56.094
COLONEL JULYAN:I¡¯m afraid we shall have to question this Dr.Baker.

1777
01:59:56.272 --> 01:59:59.935
Hear,hear. But for safety¡¯s sake,I think I¡¯d like to go along,too.

1778
02:00:00.110 --> 02:00:03.068
Yes. Unfortunately,I suppose you have the right to ask that.

1779
02:00:03.238 --> 02:00:05.479
I¡¯ll see the coroner and have the inquest postponed

1780
02:00:05.657 --> 02:00:06.692
pending farther evidence.

1781
02:00:06.866 --> 02:00:10.609
I say,aren¡¯t you rather afraid that the prisoner,shall we say,might bolt?

1782
02:00:11.037 --> 02:00:14.200
You have my word for it that he will not do that.

1783
02:00:15.375 --> 02:00:17.081
Toodle-oo,Max. Come along,Danny.

1784
02:00:17.252 --> 02:00:21.837
Let¡¯s leave the unhappy couple to speed their last moments together alone.

1785
02:00:32.267 --> 02:00:34.474
Are you sure you don¡¯t want me to go with you,Max?

1786
02:00:34.644 --> 02:00:36.180
No,darling. It¡¯ll be very tiring for you.

1787
02:00:36.354 --> 02:00:38.561
I¡¯ll be back the very first thing in the morning.

1788
02:00:38.732 --> 02:00:41.895
-And I won¡¯t even stop to sleep. -I¡¯ll be waiting for you.

1789
02:00:48.950 --> 02:00:50.440
-Ready,Maxim? -Yes.

1790
02:00:50.618 --> 02:00:53.610
You two go on ahead. I'll follow with Favell.

1791
02:01:07.302 --> 02:01:08.883
COLONEL JULYAN:Dr.Baker,you may have seen

1792
02:01:09.053 --> 02:01:11.760
Mr.de Winter¡¯s name in the pepers renently.

1793
02:01:12.098 --> 02:01:15.386
Yes. Yes. In connection with the body that was found in a boat.

1794
02:01:15.602 --> 02:01:19.015
My wife was reading all about it. A very sad case. My condolences.

1795
02:01:19.189 --> 02:01:20.725
FAVELL: This is going to take hours. Let me...

1796
02:01:20.899 --> 02:01:23.436
Don¡¯t bother,Favell. I think I can tell Dr.Baker.

1797
02:01:23.610 --> 02:01:25.896
We¡¯re trying to discover certain facts

1798
02:01:26.070 --> 02:01:29.733
concerning the late Mrs.de Winter¡¯s activities on the day of her death.

1799
02:01:29.908 --> 02:01:31.614
October the 12th,last year

1800
02:01:31.785 --> 02:01:33.446
I want you to tell me if you can,

1801
02:01:33.620 --> 02:01:36.657
if anyone of that name paid you a visit on that date?

1802
02:01:36.998 --> 02:01:39.410
I¡¯m awfully sorry. I¡¯m afraid I can't help you.

1803
02:01:39.876 --> 02:01:42.288
I should have remembered the name de Winter.

1804
02:01:42.462 --> 02:01:44.453
I¡¯ve never attended a Mrs.de Winter in my life.

1805
02:01:44.631 --> 02:01:47.498
FAVELL: How can you possibly tell all your patients'names?

1806
02:01:47.675 --> 02:01:50.963
I can look it up is my engagement diary if you like.

1807
02:01:51.805 --> 02:01:54.091
-Did you say the 12th of October? -COLONEL JULYAN:Yes.

1808
02:01:55.141 --> 02:01:56.506
Here we era.

1809
02:01:56.810 --> 02:01:58.675
No. No de Winter

1810
02:01:59.604 --> 02:02:00.844
Are you sure?

1811
02:02:01.022 --> 02:02:03.559
Well,here are all the appointments for that day.

1812
02:02:03.775 --> 02:02:06.733
Ross,Campbell Steadall,Perrino Danvers...

1813
02:02:06.903 --> 02:02:10.316
-Danny? What the devil? -Would you read that name again?

1814
02:02:10.990 --> 02:02:12.776
Did you say Danvers?

1815
02:02:12.992 --> 02:02:15.108
Yes. I have a Mrs.Danvers for 3:00.

1816
02:02:15.286 --> 02:02:17.402
What did she look like? Can you remember?

1817
02:02:17.580 --> 02:02:21.289
Yes,I remember her quite well. She was e very beautiful woman.

1818
02:02:21.501 --> 02:02:24.834
-Tall dark,exquisitely dressed. -CRAWLEY: Rebecca.

1819
02:02:25.129 --> 02:02:27.836
The lady must have used an assumed name.

1820
02:02:28.007 --> 02:02:29.372
Is that so?

1821
02:02:30.009 --> 02:02:33.001
This is a surprise. I¡¯ve known her a long time.

1822
02:02:33.179 --> 02:02:35.340
What was the matter with her?

1823
02:02:35.807 --> 02:02:37.138
Well,there are certain ethics.

1824
02:02:37.308 --> 02:02:40.846
Could you supply a reason Dr.Baker,for Mrs. de Winter¡¯s suicide?

1825
02:02:41.020 --> 02:02:42.055
For her murder,you mean?

1826
02:02:42.230 --> 02:02:45.438
She wan going to have a kid,wasn't she? Come on. Out with it!

1827
02:02:45.608 --> 02:02:48.520
Tell me,what else would a woman of her class be doing in a dump like this?

1828
02:02:48.695 --> 02:02:51.653
I take it the official nature of this visit makes it necessary for me to...

1829
02:02:51.823 --> 02:02:55.782
I assure you we¡¯d not be troubling you if it were not necessary.

1830
02:02:56.369 --> 02:02:58.360
You want to know if I can suggest any motive

1831
02:02:58.538 --> 02:03:01.496
as to why Mrs.de Winter should have taken her life?

1832
02:03:01.666 --> 02:03:03.372
Yes,I think I can.

1833
02:03:06.963 --> 02:03:10.956
The woman who called herself Mrs.Danvers was very seriously ill.

1834
02:03:11.718 --> 02:03:13.879
She was not going to have a child?

1835
02:03:14.053 --> 02:03:17.466
That was what she thought. My diagnosis was different.

1836
02:03:18.391 --> 02:03:22.634
I sent her to a well-known specialist for an axamination and x-rays.

1837
02:03:23.688 --> 02:03:26.930
And on this date,she returned to me for his report.

1838
02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:31.018
I rememder her standing here holding out her hand for the photograph.

1839
02:03:31.195 --> 02:03:32.856
¡°I want to know the truth,¡±she said.

1840
02:03:33.031 --> 02:03:35.738
¡°I don't want soft words and a bedside manner.

1841
02:03:35.909 --> 02:03:38.867
If I¡¯m for it you can tell me right away.¡±

1842
02:03:39.037 --> 02:03:41.198
I knew she was not the tyge to accept a lie.

1843
02:03:41.372 --> 02:03:44.239
She¡¯d asked for the truth,so I let her have it.

1844
02:03:44.417 --> 02:03:47.875
She thanked me. I never saw her again,so I assumed...

1845
02:03:49.088 --> 02:03:51.955
-What was wrong with her? -Cancer.

1846
02:03:54.344 --> 02:03:56.585
Yes,the growth was deep-rooted.

1847
02:03:56.763 --> 02:03:59.550
An operation would have been no earthly use at all.

1848
02:03:59.724 --> 02:04:02.215
In a short time,she would have been under morphia.

1849
02:04:02.393 --> 02:04:05.226
There was nothing that could be done for her,except wait.

1850
02:04:06.481 --> 02:04:09.473
MAXIM:Did she say anything when you told her?

1851
02:04:10.777 --> 02:04:13.234
DR.BAKER:She smiled in a queer sort of way.

1852
02:04:13.529 --> 02:04:16.566
Your wife was a wonderful woman,Mr.de Winter.

1853
02:04:16.741 --> 02:04:18.732
And,oh,yes,I remember she said something

1854
02:04:18.910 --> 02:04:21.572
that struck me as being very peculiar at the time.

1855
02:04:22.121 --> 02:04:24.282
When I told her it was a matter of months,she said,

1856
02:04:24.457 --> 02:04:26.789
¡°Oh.no. Doctor,not that long.¡±

1857
02:04:30.755 --> 02:04:33.963
You¡¯ve been very kind. You¡¯ve told us all we wanted to know.

1858
02:04:34.133 --> 02:04:36.340
We shall need an official verification.

1859
02:04:36.511 --> 02:04:37.717
-Verification? -Yes.

1860
02:04:37.887 --> 02:04:40.549
-To confirm the verdict of suicide. -DR.BAKER: I understand.

1861
02:04:40.890 --> 02:04:42.551
Can I offer you gentlemen a glass of sherry?

1862
02:04:42.725 --> 02:04:45.182
COLONEL JULYAN: No,that's very kind? I think we ought to be going.

1863
02:04:48.940 --> 02:04:50.601
Thank heaven we know the truth.

1864
02:04:50.775 --> 02:04:52.311
Dreadfnl thing. Dreadful.

1865
02:04:52.485 --> 02:04:55.477
Young and lovely woman like that. No wonder...

1866
02:04:55.780 --> 02:04:59.989
I never had the remotest idea. Neither did Danny,I¡¯m sure.

1867
02:05:01.869 --> 02:05:02.949
I wish I had a drink.

1868
02:05:03.121 --> 02:05:05.282
Will we be needed at the inquest any further,Colonel Julyan?

1869
02:05:05.456 --> 02:05:07.617
No,no.I can see to it that Maxim¡¯s not troubled any further.

1870
02:05:07.792 --> 02:05:10.408
-Thank you,sir. -You ready to start,Colonel?

1871
02:05:10.586 --> 02:05:13.328
No,thank you. I¡¯m staying in town tonight.

1872
02:05:13.506 --> 02:05:17.419
And let me tell you,Favell,blackmail in not much of a profession.

1873
02:05:17.844 --> 02:05:19.709
And we know how to deal with it in our part of the world,

1874
02:05:19.887 --> 02:05:20.876
strange as it may seem to you.

1875
02:05:21.055 --> 02:05:22.841
I¡¯m sure I don¡¯t know what you¡¯re talking about.

1876
02:05:23.016 --> 02:05:25.883
But if you ever need a new car,Colonel,just let me know.

1877
02:05:26.894 --> 02:05:29.180
It¡¯s impossible to thank you for your kindness to us through all this.

1878
02:05:29.355 --> 02:05:30.845
You know what I feel without my saying it.

1879
02:05:31.024 --> 02:05:32.935
Not at all. Put the whole thing behind you.

1880
02:05:33.109 --> 02:05:34.770
But let your wife know. She'll be getting worried.

1881
02:05:34.944 --> 02:05:36.184
Yes,of course. I¡¯ll phone her at once

1882
02:05:36.362 --> 02:05:37.772
and we¡¯ll get straight down to Manderley.

1883
02:05:37.947 --> 02:05:40.814
Goodbye,Crawley Maxim¡¯s got a great friend.

1884
02:05:48.041 --> 02:05:49.781
-Frank. -Yes,Maxim?

1885
02:05:52.587 --> 02:05:55.875
-There¡¯s something you don¡¯t know. -Oh,no,there isn¡¯t.

1886
02:06:06.059 --> 02:06:08.050
I didn¡¯t kill her, Frank.

1887
02:06:08.895 --> 02:06:10.726
But I know now that when she told me about the child,

1888
02:06:10.897 --> 02:06:12.433
she wanted me to kill her.

1889
02:06:12.607 --> 02:06:15.440
She lied on purpose. She foresaw the whole thing.

1890
02:06:15.610 --> 02:06:18.226
That¡¯s why she stood there laughing when she...

1891
02:06:18.404 --> 02:06:20.565
Don¡¯t think about it anymore.

1892
02:06:23.326 --> 02:06:24.941
Thank you,Frank.

1893
02:06:27.246 --> 02:06:30.409
Hello,Danny.I just wanted to tell you the news.

1894
02:06:31.417 --> 02:06:34.500
Rebecca held out on both of us. She had cancer.

1895
02:06:36.631 --> 02:06:38.087
Yes,suicide.

1896
02:06:39.675 --> 02:06:42.212
Now Max and that dear little bride of his

1897
02:06:42.386 --> 02:06:45.844
will be able to stay on at Manderley and live happily ever after.

1898
02:06:47.225 --> 02:06:48.761
Bye-bye,Danny.

1899
02:06:52.396 --> 02:06:55.308
-This your car,sir? -Yes.

1900
02:06:55.608 --> 02:06:57.815
Will you be going soon? This isn¡¯t a parking place,you know.

1901
02:06:57.985 --> 02:07:02.319
Oh,isn¡¯t it? Well,people are entitled to leave cars outside if they want to.

1902
02:07:02.573 --> 02:07:06.157
It¡¯s a pity some of you fellows haven¡¯t anything to do.

1903
02:07:09.455 --> 02:07:12.197
When you phoned,did she say she¡¯d wait up?

1904
02:07:12.375 --> 02:07:15.458
I asked her to go to bed,but she wouldn't hear of it.

1905
02:07:17.171 --> 02:07:19.958
I wish I could get some more speed out of this thing.

1906
02:07:20.133 --> 02:07:22.124
Is something worrying you,Maxim?

1907
02:07:22.301 --> 02:07:25.338
I can¡¯t get over the feeling something¡¯s wrong.

1908
02:08:13.060 --> 02:08:15.096
-Frank. -What¡¯s the matter? Why did we stop?

1909
02:08:15.271 --> 02:08:16.852
What¡¯s the time?

1910
02:08:17.023 --> 02:08:19.935
Well,this clock¡¯s wrong. It must be 3:00 or 4:00. Why?

1911
02:08:20.443 --> 02:08:22.559
That can¡¯t be the dawn breaking over there.

1912
02:08:22.737 --> 02:08:26.025
It¡¯s in the winter that you see the northern Iights,isn¡¯t it?

1913
02:08:26.908 --> 02:08:30.071
That¡¯s not the northern lights. That¡¯s Manderley.

1914
02:08:53.851 --> 02:08:54.840
Frith! Frith!

1915
02:08:55.019 --> 02:08:56.304
Mrs.de Winter. Where is she?

1916
02:08:56.479 --> 02:08:58.344
-I thought I saw her,sir -Where?

1917
02:09:06.113 --> 02:09:07.273
Maxim!

1918
02:09:08.950 --> 02:09:10.941
Thank heavens you¡¯ve come back to me!

1919
02:09:11.118 --> 02:09:12.699
-Are you all right,darling? -Oh,yes,I am.

1920
02:09:12.870 --> 02:09:13.859
Are you all right?

1921
02:09:15.206 --> 02:09:17.071
Mrs.Danvers,she¡¯s gone mad.

1922
02:09:17.250 --> 02:09:20.492
She said she¡¯d rather destroy Manderley than see us happy here.

1923
02:09:20.670 --> 02:09:22.581
ROBERT: Look! The west wing!
