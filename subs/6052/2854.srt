1
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,743
快啊，葛斯，快一点
Come on, Gus-Gus. Faster!

2
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,997
杰克，赶什么嘛，赶什么嘛
What's the hurry, Jaq-Jaq?
What's the hurry?

3
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:47,498
神仙教母来了
Fairy Godmother's here.

4
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,046
她要念仙度瑞拉的故事耶
She's gonna read us
the Cinderelly story.

5
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:52,591
庞庞
Pom-Pom.

6
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:01,550
“庞庞”
Pom-Pom

7
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,455
葛斯，来吧
Come on, Gus!

8
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:31,540
仙度瑞拉跟王子
从此就过着幸福快乐的日子
"Cinderella and the Prince
lived happily ever after.

9
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:35,088
说完了
"The end."

10
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,886
我们错过了
We missed it?

11
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:43,012
你可以念点别的啊
葛斯，对不起
-Maybe you could read another one.
-I'm sorry, Gus,

12
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,970
这是唯一的一本
仙度瑞拉故事书
but that's the onIy
Cinderella book there is.

13
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:50,808
对啊，葛斯 你也听到了
说完了 没有了
Yeah, Gus-Gus. You heard her.
The end. That's all.

14
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:53,439
我们可以自己做一本书
Maybe we could mak e another book.

15
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,317
我们来说故事
还要加上图画
-We can telI the stories.
-And make the drawings!

16
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:57,693
对啊…
对啊…
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

17
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,651
真是一个好主意啊
What an excellent idea.

18
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:02,657
不对，不对，等一下
No, no, wait a minute.

19
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:05,364
有谁会想要看老鼠做成的故事
Who'd wanna read a book
made by mice?

20
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,541
如果是你们做的
Cinderella would read it.

21
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:11,541
仙度瑞拉就会想看
我知道她一定会喜欢的
And if you made it,
I know that she'd love it.

22
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,793
我们又不知道怎么做书啊
But we don't know how to mak e a book.

23
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:17,718
亲爱的，别担心
这点我可以帮忙
Don't worry, dear. I think I can help.

24
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:25,426
神奇魔法
大变身
Salagadoola mechicka boola
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

25
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,727
都放在一起
会得到什么
Put 'em together
and what have you got?

26
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,350
大变身布
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

27
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,113
还要什么
Now, what do we need?

28
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,539
铅笔、蜡笔
-A pencil, indeed.
-And crayons.

29
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:48,911
颜料 胶水和擦布
-And glitter.
-And glue.

30
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,334
再用针和麻线把书牢牢缝好
We'll sew up the book
with a thread and a hook.

31
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,161
大变身布
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

32
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:57,838
哦！非常好,小老鼠做得好
可是还欠了点儿东西
Very nice. Well done, little mice.
But something is missing, it's true.

33
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:00,044
你看纸上是空的
Look there. The pages are bare.

34
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:03,596
故事得由你们来补
谁？我们？
-We need a story from you.
-Who, us?

35
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:06,221
不行，我们哪知道什么好故事
No, no, we don't know any good stories.

36
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:10,805
等一等，等一等！
这个呢 第一天进宫的故事
Wait, wait!
How's about "First Day in Castle"?

37
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,891
对，这个故事很棒
Oh, yeah. That is a good one.

38
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:17,611
我也很想听听这个故事
I'd love to hear all about it.

39
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,743
这是仙度瑞拉和王子刚结完婚
It was right after
Cinderelly and the Prince married.

40
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:31,667
小老鼠全都搬到了大皇宫里面
Mice-mice moved to the big castle.

41
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,789
整个皇宫都是我们的了
We had it all to ourselves,

42
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,043
我们也过着非常的悠闲
and we were having
the time of our lives.

43
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,806
仙度瑞拉回来了
Cinderelly's back!

44
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,635
老天，他们回来了
他们回来了
-Oh, dear, they're back!
-They're back!

45
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,431
他们回来了
他们回来了
-They're back!
-They're back!

46
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,696
我们回来了
欢迎回家
-We're back!
-Welcome home.

47
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,620
我会住在城堡里
我还是不敢相信
I still can't believe
I'm going to live in a castle.

48
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:11,289
告诉我，我真的不是在作梦
Are you sure this isn't just a dream?

49
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,207
你现在是王子妃了
You're a princess now.

50
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,870
仙度瑞拉王妃
Princess Cinderella.

51
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:20,253
她根本就不知道
怎么当一个王妃
She won't even know the first thing
about being a princess.

52
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,335
她刚刚才度蜜月回来嘛
She just got back from her honeymoon.

53
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,342
好好教导那个女孩是你的责任
It's going to be your duty
to prepare the girl.

54
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,266
国王陛下，这是我的荣幸
Your Majesty, I am honoured.

55
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,014
傻瓜，不是你 普露登丝
Not you, ninny. Prudence!

56
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,561
当然不是你
Of course not you.

57
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:37,106
国王陛下这一次
想把事情给做好
He wants the job done right
the first time.

58
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:41,563
从现在开始
国宴就是仙度瑞拉的责任了
The royal banquet
will be Cinderella's responsibility now.

59
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,068
您说的是…国宴
The royal banquet?

60
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,775
你要教她应该知道的一切事情
You'll teach her everything
she needs to know.

61
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,955
但是…陛下，她根本不知道
怎么样去策划一个国宴
But, sire, she won't know anything
about planning a royal banquet.

62
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:55,159
我根本就不知道
怎样策划一个国宴
I don't know anything about
planning a royal banquet.

63
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,539
不过我可以留到十二点以后
Oh, well.
At least I can stay past midnight.

64
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:01,040
我会永远待在你身边
好极了
Perfect! And I'll be right by your side.

65
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,758
你要我现在就出门
I have to go? Now?

66
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,969
我不能就这样丢下我的王妃
父王
Father, I can't just
abandon my princess!

67
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,924
只剩下两天了
尤其现在离国宴
Not with the royal banquet
only two days away.

68
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:13,727
我们有很重要的
国家大事要处理
胡说八道
Nonsense! We have important
matters of state to attend to.

69
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:16,055
很重要的国家大事
lmportant matters of state!

70
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,980
父王…
Father...

71
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,184
她没有时间可以准备
She hasn't had time to prepare.

72
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,394
她以前又没有当过王妃
She's never been a princess before.

73
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:28,029
陛下，恕我斗胆
您也非常看重您的国宴吧
I dare say, Majesty,
you do like your banquets just so, eh?

74
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,952
有点儿太过份了
这样要求王子妃
It's a great deal to ask of the poor girl.

75
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,449
胡说八道
Nonsense!

76
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:37,956
国王陛下，我可以做好这些准备工作
就跟以前一样
Your Majesty, I can take care
of the preparations as I always do.

77
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,537
只管教她怎么做
Just show her what to do!

78
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:45,046
我们现在有王妃了
策划国宴是她的责任
We have a princess now.
It's her duty to plan the banquet.

79
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:49,379
而忍受这些是国王的责任
And the King's duty to endure it.

80
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,136
是的，国王陛下
Yes, Your Majesty.

81
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:55,219
好了，我们出发了
Now off we go!

82
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,642
谢谢了
对不起，一回来我就得离开你
-Thank you.
-I'm sorry I have to rush off.

83
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,849
别担心，我不会有事的
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

84
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:04,311
一定会出乎我们意料
我相信你策划的宴会
I know you're gonna surprise us
with an incredible feast.

85
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,988
只希望到时候你们不会太意外
I just hope you're not too surprised.

86
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,437
仙度瑞拉
Cinderelly!

87
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:44,893
杰克！葛斯！玛丽！嗨，老朋友们
Jaq! Gus! Mary! Hello, old friends.

88
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:47,946
布鲁诺
Bruno!

89
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:53,618
你们快看，好大的椅子
是仙度瑞拉王妃的
Look-look.
Big chair for Princess Cinderelly!

90
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:56,909
我的天啊
Oh, my.

91
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,910
城堡也好大
Big castle, too.

92
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:06,214
仙度瑞拉，别担心
我们老鼠来帮忙了
Don't worry, Cinderelly.
Us mice here to help.

93
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:10,214
杰克，谢谢
我们明天还有一整天要忙呢
Why, thank you, Jaq. We've got
a big day ahead of us tomorrow.

94
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,633
各位，往这一边
This way, fellas.

95
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,574
早安，王妃殿下
Good morning, Your Highness.

96
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:44,703
王妃殿下
Your Highness!

97
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,337
早餐做好罗
今天吃起司蛋卷怎么样啊
Ready for breakfast?
How does a cheese omelette sound?

98
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,510
王妃不见了
The Princess is missing!

99
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,895
喂！女孩
你有没有看见王妃啊
You! You, girI!
Have you seen the Princess?

100
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,938
普露登丝，你早啊
Good morning, Prudence.

101
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:08,985
我以为你…
哎哟！看你那一身衣服
Oh, I thought you...
But those awful clothes!

102
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:13,236
我刚刚没认出你来
王妃殿下
Well, I didn't recognise you,
Your Highness.

103
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,988
容我介绍你的帖身侍女
Allow me to introduce
your ladies-in-waiting.

104
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,321
碧翠斯跟戴芙妮
很高兴认识你们
-Beatrice and Daphne.
-Pleased to meet you.

105
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,407
刚好来吃早餐吧
You're just in time for breakfast.

106
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,959
吃早餐？土司加果酱？
Breakfast? With toast and jam?

107
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,254
王妃殿下
王妃绝对不用自己准备早餐的
Your Highness, a princess
never prepares her own meals.

108
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:35,132
我们皇宫的规矩不是这样的
That is not how things are done.

109
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,339
这里连早餐都有规矩
There are rules about breakfast?

110
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:40,801
我们这里有很多规矩
王妃殿下
Of course there are rules,
Your Highness.

111
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:45,355
但是你不知道城堡里的规矩
并不是你的错
But it's not your fault that you
don't know the traditions of the castle.

112
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:49,230
正是国王希望我教你的
这些事情
That's what the King
expects me to teach you.

113
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,899
我相信我很快就会学会
I'm sure I can learn it in no time.

114
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,655
来吧，没时间胡搞了
Come along.
There's no time to dally.

115
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:57,906
只管听我的一切就会没事了
Just do as I say,
and everything will be fine.

116
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,332
要是国王一定会吓坏的
The King would be horrified

117
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:09,584
看到国宴的女主人
打扮的像一个洗碗的女佣
to find the hostess of the royal banquet
dressed like a scullery maid!

118
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:13,132
王妃一定要穿得像一个皇族
A princess must be attired like royalty.

119
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:17,171
我一定要天天穿着这个吗
Do I have to wear this all the time?

120
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,426
当然不是，王妃殿下
Oh, of course not, Your Highness.

121
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:22,099
还要穿得更正式才行
你晚餐的时候
You'll need something
much more formal for dinner.

122
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,933
我可不可以穿我自己的衣服
Couldn't I just wear
one of my own dresses?

123
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:32,110
真是有趣，王妃殿下
这是绝不可能的
Very amusing, Your Highness,
but it simply isn't done.

124
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,917
今天的天气非常好
我们把窗帘打开吧
It's such a beautiful day.
Why don't we open the curtains?

125
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:51,496
不行…
这些窗帘从来没有拉开过
No, no, no!
These curtains are never opened.

126
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:55,964
而且也不该由王妃来拉开
And certainly not by a princess.

127
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:59,296
这是绝对不可能的事
It most definitely isn't done.

128
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,268
公爵和子爵坐的最靠近国王
Duk es and viscounts
sit nearest the King

129
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,471
除非现场还有侯爵
unless there is a marquis present.

130
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,557
不是很好吗
大家都坐自己喜欢的位置
Wouldn't it be nice
if people could sit where they like?

131
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:16,488
不行，公爵绝对不能坐在
侯爵之上，男爵之下
No. You must never seat a duke
above a marquis or below a baron.

132
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,573
王妃殿下，哪个颜色才对
Which colour is correct, Your Highness?

133
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,947
黄色还是米色
Cream or ecru?

134
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,237
米色好了
Ecru?

135
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,618
拜托，不行
黄色
Goodness, no. Cream.

136
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,700
那两个颜色没什么差别
But there isn't any difference.

137
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:32,788
老天，这么少时间，这么多要学
Oh, my. So much to learn. So little time.

138
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,751
在国宴里依照惯例
At the banquet, as always,

139
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:41,213
国宴的菜单包括
半熟的烤牛肉
the royal menu shall consist
of the rarest roast beef,

140
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:45,175
法式洋葱汤
新鲜马铃薯泥,法式烤面包
French onion soup, tarragon mashed
potatoes, freshly baked baguettes,

141
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:49,354
国内最棒的巧克力
至于甜点呢
the finest truffles in the kingdom
and, for dessert,

142
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,561
有挪威式炖梅子
Norwegian stewed prunes.

143
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:56,228
梅子…当甜点
Prunes? For dessert?

144
00:10:56,322 --> 00:11:00,281
这是从来没有改变过的传统
国王喜欢的
The King expects it.
It is a tradition that is never broken.

145
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:03,360
而且我…也喜欢
Besides, I like them.

146
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:11,581
王妃殿下会在这个地点
欢迎她的贵宾
Your Highness shall pause here
to greet her noble guests.

147
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:15,789
请记得
对皇族点点头,对贵族挥挥手
Remember.
Curtsy to royalty, wave to nobility.

148
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:18,591
我知道，这个我会
I know I can do this right.

149
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,385
仙度瑞拉
仙度瑞拉…嗨
-Cinderella!
-Cinderella! Hi!

150
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:24,635
我的朋友！你们好
My friends! Hello! Hello!

151
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:28,560
看到你们好开心 请等一下
How nice to see you. Wait just a minute.

152
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,479
把大门打开
不行，不行
-Open the gate!
-No, no, no!

153
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:34,683
大门只能为皇族的贵宾打开
These gates are onIy opened
for royal visitors.

154
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:39,396
你一定要记得这些规矩
You must remember the rules.

155
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:43,241
平民是绝对不准进入皇宫
Commoners are never allowed
in the palace.

156
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,114
这根本不可能
It simply isn't done.

157
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,576
再见
Bye-bye!

158
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,776
王妃殿下,皇族一定要
At the very least,
one must learn to dance

159
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,070
自然优雅地跳舞
with poise and grace.

160
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:25,526
我在努力了,我…我只是需要多加练习
I'm trying, I just need more practise.

161
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:31,865
一定要十全十美
这是国王最喜欢的舞曲
It must be perfect.
It is the King's favourite dance.

162
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:43,335
不对，不对,王妃殿下
你一定要跳的更慢更正式
No, no, no, Your Highness.
It must be slower and more formal.

163
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,011
王妃殿下，粉色或白色
Your Highness, eggshell or bone?

164
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,714
粉色      白色
-Eggshell?
-Bone.

165
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:50,391
请问谁坐在伯爵旁边
Now, who sits next to the count?

166
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,764
是侯爵
公爵吗
-The duk e?
-The marquis.

167
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,595
做什么的
金或银
-Gold or silver?
-For what?

168
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,148
男爵还是子爵    谁？
-Baron or viscount?
-Who?

169
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,772
应该喝红茶还是清茶
我不知道
-Pekoe or Darjeeling?
-I don't know!

170
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,568
炖的还是烤的
Braised or broiIed?

171
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,567
站着还是坐着
鱼还是鸡
-Fish or fowl?
-Stand or sit?

172
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:05,740
注意节奏    往上往下
-Mind the music!
-Hair up or down?

173
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,317
错还是对    小心椅子
挥手还是敬礼
左或右…
-Left or right?
-One or two?

174
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,368
王妃殿下，王妃殿下
-Watch the chair!
-Your Highness!

175
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:22,170
这支舞曲最好是站起来跳
王妃殿下
Your Highness, the dance
is best performed on one's feet.

176
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,194
哼！这下可有好戏看
This is a disaster.

177
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,507
可怜的仙度瑞拉 拜托不要哭
Poor Cinderelly. Please don't cry.

178
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:08,883
仙度瑞拉不快乐
小老鼠也不开心
Cinderelly not happy,
mice-mice not happy.

179
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:12,181
杰克，我该怎么办才好
Jaq, what am I going to do?

180
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:15,385
我根本就当不好王妃
I'm a complete failure as a princess.

181
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:22,225
我为什么没有办法做好呢
Why can't I Iearn to do this right?

182
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,443
你看看我
Look at me.

183
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,694
仙度瑞拉看来不像仙度瑞拉了
Cinderelly not look like Cinderelly.

184
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:34,371
真的耶 反正就是有点不太对劲
It's true. Something's just not right here.

185
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,581
比方炖梅子
like stewed prunes?

186
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:42,162
一点也没错
还有他们为什么要让皇宫那么暗
Exactly, Gus. And why do they
have to keep the palace so dark?

187
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,338
还有那个可怕的舞
And that awful dance.

188
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,292
还有那些
看起来全都一样的无聊颜色
And those boring colours
that all look the same.

189
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,752
还有炖梅子
And stewed prunes!

190
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:52,589
尤其是那些
不准平民进来皇宫的规矩
Especially those rules about
keeping commoners out of the palace!

191
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,345
王子娶我的时候我是个女佣
Why, I was a dish maid
when the Prince married me.

192
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:58,599
他爱的人是…原来的我
And he loves me because I'm me.

193
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:03,023
我一直在跟着别人的规矩
去想当别人
I've been trying to obey someone else's
rules about who I should be

194
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,022
去学怎么样穿衣服
and how I should dress.

195
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,814
还有这个发型
This hair!

196
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:16,116
我知道我做得到的
只要我不要再去学着当别人了
l know I can do this. I just have to
stop trying to be someone else.

197
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,531
杰克，她会怎么做
What'll she do, Jaq-Jaq?

198
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:22,915
我要照自己的方式来策划国宴
葛斯
Gus, I'm going to plan
this banquet my way.

199
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:27,957
红尘世事多变
没有规则能永远
Who's to say the rules
must stay the same forevermore?

200
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,213
把大门打开
Open the gates!

201
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:36,925
规定会一再出现
反覆只是一瞬间
Whoever made them had to change
the rules that came before

202
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,226
走自己的路
So make your own way

203
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:42,271
梦想迎你往前
Show the beauty within

204
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:48,319
朝着心的方向
前方一片蓝天
When you follow your heart
there's no heart you can't win

205
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,822
谢谢你
Why, thank you!

206
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:57,282
王妃殿下
国王绝对不会赞成
Your Highness,
the King would not approve.

207
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:01,116
你应该要邀请公爵、伯爵
还有其他的贵族
You're supposed to be inviting dukes
and counts and other aristocrats.

208
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:05,499
我会邀请他们
还会邀请我在村子里所有的朋友
I am inviting them, along with
all my friends here in the village.

209
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:10,417
王妃殿下
我真心的建议您别这样
Your Highness,
I strongly advise against it.

210
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:14,470
这种改变
在皇宫是绝对不可能的
It's simply not the way things are done.

211
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:19,225
趁这个机会
你也应该试试新的改变
Perhaps the time has come
to try something new.

212
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:23,726
展开你双臂天际不再遥远
So reach for the sky
it's not high as it seems

213
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:30,062
你终于发现
实践让你实现
Just follow your heart
go as far as your dreams

214
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:34,195
这个宴会是需要改变
就从甜点开始
This party needs help,
starting with dessert.

215
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,492
不要梅子
No prunes. Yuck!

216
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,953
杰克喜欢巧克力
Jaq-Jaq love chocolate.

217
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:50,715
巧克力布丁
这个甜点听起来好多了
Chocolate pudding!
Now that sounds good.

218
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:57,505
“梅子”
Prunes

219
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,144
我从来没有跳过这种舞
We never get to dance like this.

220
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,896
尽情地探索不怕犯错
Dance if you want to
don't fear you'll fall

221
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:20,913
努力过，才算无怨地
无悔地忠于自我
Take a chance, 'cause it's better
than never to chance it at all

222
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:26,618
这是不可能的 这根本就是不可能的
It simply isn't done. It simply isn't done!

223
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,672
这是不可能的
It simply isn't done!

224
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:37,254
根本不可能
根本不可能，根本不可能
It simply isn't done,
it simply isn't done, it simply isn't done.

225
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:43,973
世界纵然瞬息万变不要惊慌
There's a world full of changing
and you've just begun

226
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:47,643
勇敢往前闯，释放出能量
Don 't let them tell you
it's simply not done

227
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:54,650
阳光指引你心的方向在前方
When you follow your heart
you'll shine bright as the sun

228
00:17:56,867 --> 00:18:01,406
王妃殿下，黄色还是肤色
你喜欢哪个颜色
-Your Highness, sand or buff?
-Which colour do you like?

229
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:03,617
粉红
Pink!

230
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,910
就是它
Perfect.

231
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:11,041
好像还是少了一样什么东西
Something's still missing.

232
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,424
这样才比较像样一点
Now, that's more like it.

233
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:22,511
国王会怎么说
我知道这是一大改变
-What will the King say?
-I know this is a big change.

234
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,558
让我用我的方式试试
But I have to try this my way.

235
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:30,603
好吧，我希望你知道
你自己在做什么
Well, then, I certainly hope
you know what you're doing.

236
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,488
仙度瑞拉，他们回来了
他们回来了
They're here, Cinderelly! They're here!

237
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:48,158
好吧，现在回头已经来不及了
Well, it's too late to turn back now.

238
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:08,769
这种舞才比较像话嘛
Now, this dance is more like it.

239
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,523
这种舞真是太可怕了
This dance is horrifying!

240
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,557
国王陛下，要来了
The King has arrived.

241
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,058
有布丁啊
Pudding!

242
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,653
这里到底是怎么一回事
What in blazes is going on here?

243
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,200
国王陛下
Your Majesty!

244
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:11,540
是谁把窗帘拉开的
全是王妃殿下的杰作
-Who opened those curtains?
-This is all Princess Cinderella's doing!

245
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,877
好可爱的月亮
What a lovely moon.

246
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:19,333
我劝过她好几回
有平民进了皇宫
-I tried to teach her, sire.
-Commoners in the palace?

247
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:21,793
她就是不肯听我的
She simply refused to listen.

248
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,550
阿昌，是你啊
这真是丑闻
-Oh, hello, Giuseppe!
-It's a scandal!

249
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,348
国王陛下…我可以解释
Your Majesty, I can explain.

250
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,472
这是什么
What is this?

251
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,474
陛下，是您的甜点
Your dessert, sire.

252
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,977
甜点不吃梅子了吗？
No prunes for dessert?

253
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,354
这点真是太可恶了
An absolute outrage!

254
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,855
巧克力，很好吃嘛
Chocolate. My favourite!

255
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:51,038
音乐是怎么了
大家一起跳舞吧
What happened to the music?
Everybody dance!

256
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:11,016
我就说我们这里
需要点新的改变
I always said we needed
some new traditions around here.

257
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:15,142
普露登丝，去玩吧
别错过这儿的乐趣
Go on, now, Prudence.
You're missing all the fun.

258
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,733
我错过了什么吗
还好啦
-Did I miss something?
-Surprise!

259
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,908
成功的国宴，棒极了
Splendid job. Splendid!

260
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:36,163
这一切都要归功给仙度瑞拉王妃
陛下
It is the Princess
who deserves your praise, sire.

261
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:41,213
而我非常荣幸
能为王妃殿下服务
And I am honoured to be
at Her Highness's service.

262
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,167
将来我们一定会是好朋友的
I think we're going to be great friends.

263
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,439
我告诉我儿子他可真会挑
I told my son he had chosen well.

264
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:08,900
你是天生的王妃
You're a natural.

265
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:12,327
万岁！万岁！
Hooray! Hooray!

266
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,120
再继续跳吧
Another dance!

267
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:17,450
我很高兴你照自己的方式做
I'm glad you do things your own way.

268
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:20,127
总有一天我会是一个好王妃
Someday I'll get
this princess thing right.

269
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:22,250
我想那一天就是今天
I think that day is today.

270
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:35,969
仙度瑞拉真的改变了
皇宫里的很多事
Well, Cinderella certainly
turned things around, didn't she?

271
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,145
对，不用梳高高的头发
Yeah, no more big hair.

272
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:39,893
也没有梅子
Or prunes.

273
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,865
“墨汁”
INK

274
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:50,073
我拿不起来
Can't get it.

275
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,201
我来帮点忙吧
Let me help with that.

276
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,037
我不太喜欢这些法术
小心啊
Watch it. I don't like that magic stuff.

277
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:04,373
还记得上次发生的事情吗
我们应该也纪录下那个故事
-Remember what happened last time.
-Oh, now there's a story we should tell.

278
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,707
对，真的很精采
Yeah, that's a good one!

279
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:12,179
不要，不要…
那个故事非常的无聊
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Very, very boring story.

280
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:14,507
我们可不想听那个故事
We don't want to hear that one.

281
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:18,686
杰克，那个我爱听
好，那就说吧
-But, Jaq, it's my favourite.
-Okay, let's hear it.

282
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:22,685
那个愿望是很不寻常
亲爱的，杰克
Well, it certainly was
an unusual wish, Jaq, dear.

283
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:27,361
事情的发展
可惜也没照你计划的
But things didn't turn out
quite the way you had planned.

284
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:30,861
杰克，我们在花园里做什么
What are we doing
in the garden, Jaq-Jaq?

285
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,158
葛斯还没有吃早餐呢
Gus-Gus not had breakfast yet.

286
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,371
葛斯，我们要摘一些花朵
去送给仙度瑞拉
Gus-Gus, we're going to pick flowers
for Cinderelly.

287
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,868
为什么啊
What for?

288
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:41,371
我们都还没有机会为她做点事
因为到现在
We never get to do anything
for Cinderelly now.

289
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:43,498
我们做过了
Sure we do.

290
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:47,332
做过什么
我看看哦
-like what?
-Well, let's see.

291
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,916
看吧
See?

292
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:54,889
仙度瑞拉不需要老鼠
有很多人在帮她了
Cinderelly don't need mice-mice.
She got lots of people to help her.

293
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:58,138
我想要带一大束花送给她
Well, I want to bring her
a big bunch of flowers.

294
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:25,373
这样够了
眼光要放大，葛斯
-That's enough!
-You've got to think big, Gus-Gus.

295
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:28,839
是庞庞…
Pom-Pom!

296
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,442
王妃殿下，您的花
谢谢
-Your flowers, Highness.
-Well, thank you.

297
00:24:56,537 --> 00:25:00,371
这些比昨天的花更漂亮
Oh, these are even prettier
than yesterday's.

298
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:05,208
这是明天的节庆还剩下
必须准备进行的准备工作
Here's the list of remaining preparations
for the festival tomorrow.

299
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:10,043
我们这里举办的宴会还真多
We sure throw a lot of parties
around here, don't we?

300
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,466
这一次不只是宴会，殿下
This is no mere party, Highness.

301
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:15,090
这是春季的嘉年华会
This is the Spring Festival!

302
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:24,470
两位，你们早安啊
你们拿了什么来
Oh, good morning, fellas.
What do you have there?

303
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:28,107
给你的 可惜花太小了
For you. But they're too small.

304
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:34,981
这些花好漂亮
你们好体帖，谢谢
They're beautiful!
How very sweet. Thank you.

305
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,615
王妃殿下，嘉年华会的委员们
Your Highness, the festival committee

306
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,284
全都在会议室
is assembled in the library

307
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,862
等候您的指示
awaiting your instructions.

308
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:45,870
你的澡盆在浴室等着你呢
And the bath is in the pantry
awaiting you.

309
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,747
两位，稍候见罗
I'll see you later, boys.

310
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,579
早安，杰克
Good morning, Jaq.

311
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,965
嗨！玛丽，漂亮的外套
Hello, Mary. Pretty coat!

312
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:56,423
我为你做的
I made it for you.

313
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,715
想试试看吗
Want to try it on?

314
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,095
真好耶
Oh, very nice.

315
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:05,807
仙度瑞拉，忘了宴会清单
Cinderelly forgot party list!

316
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:10,437
把清单拿给仙度瑞拉
杰克可以帮忙
Jaq can help. Take list to Cinderelly!

317
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:22,237
我来接！没问题
I got it! No problem.

318
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,575
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

319
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:32,000
王子和我会一起剪彩
然后嘉年华会就开始
The Prince and I will
cut the ribbon to begin the festival.

320
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:33,581
还有其他建议吗
Any other suggestions?

321
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:38,089
我建议
我们把春季嘉年华会延到夏天
I propose we move
the Spring festival to summer.

322
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:42,219
这一点我怎么没有想到呢
真天才
Genius!
I wish I had thought of it myself.

323
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:45,722
春季嘉年华会了
那么我想这就不叫
It wouldn't be
a Spring Festival any more.

324
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:47,144
对…说的是
Yes, yes, quite so.

325
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:49,938
当然不算了
王妃殿下
Of course not,
I dare say, Your Highness.

326
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,060
好香
Yummy.

327
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:54,234
我们不应该邀请小孩
Perhaps we should
not invite the children.

328
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:59,065
别让他们来
不要小孩 真是好主意
-Can't open.
-No children. A brilliant idea.

329
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,195
但是嘉年华会是为小孩办的
The festival is for children.

330
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,777
这个提议更杰出
An even more brilliant rebuttal!

331
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:08,741
我只有同意了
但是要排好长的队伍
Oh, I suppose.
But the lines are so long.

332
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:11,748
没问题，再多加一些木马
No problem.
We'll add more rides.

333
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:21,387
救命啊！好可怕的小老鼠
真是恶心，救命啊
Help! I can't stand mice!
Oh, no! Disgusting!

334
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,104
杰克，你还好吗
Jaq, are you all right?

335
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:39,313
没有帮到仙度瑞拉
杰克只会制造麻烦
No help to Cinderelly.
Just mak e a big mess.

336
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:42,275
杰克，我也很难过 这样吧
I'm sorry, Jaq. Tell you what.

337
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:45,782
我打算到园游会场地去
你跟我一块儿去好了
I'm about to go out to the fairgrounds.
Why don't you come?

338
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:49,661
我真的需要你的帮忙
帮忙，啧啧
-I could really use your help.
-Help? Zug-zug!

339
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,458
十分钟以后在马厩跟我碰面
Meet me at the stabIes in ten minutes.

340
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:53,877
没问题
No problem.

341
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:57,714
马儿乖啊
Here we are. There, Charger.

342
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:17,226
不知道仙度瑞拉在这里
能找得到我吗
Wow. Not sure Cinderelly
can find me down here.

343
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,582
杰克
Jaq?

344
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,920
杰克
仙度瑞…
-Jaq?
-Hey, Cind...

345
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,545
杰克    
Jaq?

346
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:44,629
王妃殿下
你的护卫在外面等你
Your Highness,
your escort is waiting outside.

347
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,930
谢谢 杰克
Thank you. Jaq?

348
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:48,515
仙度瑞拉
Cinderelly!

349
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,927
算了，他大概有事吧
Oh, well. I guess he couldn't come.

350
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,271
完了
Oh, no!

351
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,771
仙度瑞拉，等等
Cinderelly, wait!

352
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,114
仙度瑞拉
Cinderelly!

353
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:17,002
嗨！
Hey!

354
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:19,121
嗨
Hey.

355
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,380
仙度瑞拉
Cinderelly?

356
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:35,054
我没有办法做任何事
我帮不上忙
I never get to do anything any more.
I never get to help.

357
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:38,106
被丢在后面 甩在泥巴里
我以前帮的忙很多啊
Get left behind sitting in the dirt.
Used to help a lot.

358
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:41,606
现在太小不能做这个
太小不能做那个
Now I'm too small to do this,
too small to do that,

359
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,653
太小帮不了仙度瑞拉
too small to help Cinderelly.

360
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,321
对任何人都没有用
No good to anybody!

361
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,566
皇宫不像老家那样
Castle not like old house.

362
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:50,448
皇宫是给大人住的
哪里都不适合老鼠
Castle for big people.
No place for mice!

363
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:53,497
什么东西都比我还大
连花都比我大
Everything's bigger than me.
Even flowers bigger!

364
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:57,000
我不喜欢这么小
不喜欢当一只老鼠
Don't like being small.
Don't like being a mouse.

365
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:58,452
我真希望很大
I wish I was big!

366
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,134
好了，亲爱的
There, there, dear.

367
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,062
告诉我…
Tell me all...

368
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:19,140
杰克 杰克
Jaq? Jaq?

369
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:24,561
亲爱的，你在这儿啊
Oh, there you are, dear.

370
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:29,901
我听到你许的愿了
你不喜欢现在这样子吗
I heard your wish, Jaq.
Aren't you happy the way you are?

371
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:33,032
只有大人才能帮仙度瑞拉
我希望我大一点
Only big people help Cinderelly.
I want to be big!

372
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:35,785
不对，我希望变成…人类
No, I want to be human.

373
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:38,117
人类？我的老天啊
Human? Oh, good heavens!

374
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:43,547
杰克，你一直在用你的方式
帮助仙度瑞拉的
But, Jaq, you've always helped
Cinderella just the way you are.

375
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:47,342
仙度瑞拉现在是王妃了
没时间理老鼠
Cinderelly's a princess now.
No time for mice.

376
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,090
反正也没有人喜欢老鼠
Nobody likes mice anyway.

377
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:51,172
原来你是这么想的
So that's what you think.

378
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:56,602
我被大猫欺负 还有马匹
还有可怕的胖女人
I get beat up by cat and horse
and big, scary lady!

379
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,397
人类比较大 比较大比较好
Humans are bigger. Bigger better.

380
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:05,061
如果你真的这么觉得的话呢
lf you really feel that way

381
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:10,900
那我只有实现你的愿望
才会知道罗
perhaps it would be for the best
to grant your wish.

382
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,578
大变身布
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

383
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,969
阳光跟着你普照大地
The sun's up shining, silver lining

384
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:33,172
这将是多美好的一天
It's gonna be a beautiful day

385
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:36,804
真想不到我是人了 你好吗
Jaq. The human Jaq. How do you do?

386
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:40,638
听那钟声鸟儿欢唱
Church bells ringing, birds all singing

387
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,439
多快乐活似神仙
Everything's going my way

388
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:46,519
活似神仙
我真的是人了
Zug-zug. I really am human.

389
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:52,032
微风吹闻花香
Climb the trees, smell the breeze

390
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:55,782
开怀放声笑
Laugh with all your might

391
00:31:55,872 --> 00:32:01,458
白云蓝天呼唤我不怕考验
Blue skies showing
everything's going right

392
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,963
只抱怨不会行动
You'll never stop the raining
by sitting and complaining

393
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:11,043
谁也无法改变在你四周的事
It all comes down to you

394
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:14,722
展开笑颜参考意见
You'll smile again, it happens when

395
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:17,220
自然有快乐时
You change your point of view

396
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:21,223
我喜欢上面这里的风景
I love the view from up here!

397
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:24,226
个子小心眼好
When you're small, one-inch tall

398
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:27,901
突然变成六英尺高
And then you're 6'2"

399
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:33,449
你成了大人物
全世界都仰赖你法宝
You've hit the big time now
and the world is looking up to you

400
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:35,992
她在哪里
我应该怎么说
There she is. What am I going to say?

401
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:40,155
仙度瑞拉王妃
是我，杰克
Princess Cinderelly, it's me, Jaq!

402
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,617
你看我变成人了
我现在也是人了
Look, I'm human now.
I'm human now, too!

403
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:47,375
个子小心眼好
When you're small, one-inch tall

404
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:50,754
突然变成六英尺高
And then you're 6'2"

405
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:52,630
你成了大人物
You've hit the big time now

406
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:54,006
仙度瑞拉！是我！
Cinderelly! It's me!

407
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:56,258
全世界都仰赖你法宝
The world is looking up to you

408
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,885
法宝
Yeah, you

409
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,058
亲爱的先生
我是人
-My dear sir.
-Oh, you poor man!

410
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:01,931
爵士…
我是…
-Sir...
-I'm...

411
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,853
休爵士，你好啊
Sir Hugh, is it?

412
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:08,274
很高兴认识你
我也…很高兴认识你
-Well, then. Pleased to know you.
-I knows to please you, too!

413
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:10,977
休爵士，你还好吗
是的，是的，我…
-Are you all right, Sir Hugh?
-Yes, yes, I...

414
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:14,690
姓休？是比利时的姓吧
什么，不对，不对
-Hugh, eh? Would that be Belgian?
-What? Eh, no, no.

415
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,866
当然不对
你没有口音
No, no, no, of course not. No accent.

416
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:20,787
不好意思弄脏你衣服
来，我帮你擦一擦
I'm so sorry about the mess.
Here, let me help you.

417
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:24,116
这就是我来这儿的原因
不用…
No, no, that's why I'm here.
To help you. I'm...

418
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:26,247
委员会派你来的
我是来帮你的
The committee sent you!

419
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,954
你是来帮忙嘉年华会的
You're here to help
with the Spring Festival?

420
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:31,961
你是荷兰人
不对，我是说…我是…
-You're Dutch!
-No. I mean yes. But I'm...

421
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:37,383
迟到了！王妃殿下，我们迟到了
我们该回皇宫去了
Late! Your Highness, it is late.
We're expected back at the palace.

422
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:42,138
一起骑马回去吧
骑马，骑在马背上
-Shall we ride back together?
-Ride? On horses?

423
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,554
乖乖马
休爵士
-Nice horsie!
-Sir Hugh?

424
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,981
你以前骑过马吗
Have you ridden before?

425
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:55,780
休爵士，休爵士？你在这里
Sir Hugh? Sir Hugh? There you are.

426
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:00,819
哇！一大束桃花耶
Peach blossoms.

427
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:03,747
你真好，这些花好美，谢谢
Aren't you sweet?
They're beautiful. Thank you.

428
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,956
王妃殿下，你来了
Highness, there you are.

429
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,834
裁缝现在惊慌失措
厨师那儿有个麻烦
The tailor is in a dither.
The cook is having a crisis.

430
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:15,668
动物训练师被吓破了胆子
他们全都要找你
The animal trainer is flummoxed!
And they're all asking for you.

431
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:19,755
请帮这些花找个花瓶好吗
我马上就回来
Could you please find a vase for these?
I'll be right back.

432
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,340
你帮了好多忙
休爵士，谢谢你
Thank you, Sir Hugh. You're a big help.

433
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:30,106
帮仙度瑞拉处理这些花
好极了
Perfect.
Helping Cinderelly with flowers.

434
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,082
庞庞
Pom-Pom!

435
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:55,965
我不应该怕一只猫的
I shouldn't be afraid of cat!

436
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,592
我现在是人了
比猫还大
I am human now. Bigger than cat.

437
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,557
但是我还是怕猫
But I am still afraid of cat!

438
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,684
真好，你找到花瓶了
Oh, good. You found a vase.

439
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:18,567
刚刚好耶 我要跟王妃说
Happy to help. What I want to...

440
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,866
女伯爵来了
在大厅等您
The Countess Legrande
is awaiting you in the dining hall.

441
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,944
你能先帮我招呼她吗
休爵士
Think you could keep
her company till I get there?

442
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,001
老鼠
A mouse!

443
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,749
我在干嘛？我现在是人了
What am I doing? I'm a man now.

444
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:41,712
又大又肥的老鼠
不，是葛斯
-A big, fat mouse!
-Oh, no. Gus-Gus!

445
00:35:43,183 --> 00:35:44,423
滚开
Get away!

446
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:57,565
我的英雄，你救了我
My hero. Oh, you saved me.

447
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:01,524
太好了，我们找到带头
跳第一支舞的人了
Well, I think we just found the couple
to lead the first dance.

448
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:08,280
我们最好赶快开始准备
休爵士，我会派个车夫给你
We better go get ready.
I'll send a valet for you, Sir Hugh.

449
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,331
嘉年华会见罗
See you at the festival.

450
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,801
玛丽，杰克在哪里啊
Hey, Mary, where's Jaq-Jaq?

451
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:29,885
葛斯，我不知道啊
我也在为他担心
I don't know, Gus.
I'm worried about him.

452
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,059
我在这里
Here I am.

453
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,810
等一等
Wait!

454
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,561
是我耶
It's me.

455
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:42,864
杰克，亲爱的，一切都还好吗
Jaq, is everything all right, dear?

456
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:46,034
对，很好，没问题
Yes. Great. No problem.

457
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:50,489
你把你的朋友们吓了一大跳呢
Well, I think you gave your friends
a bit of a fright.

458
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:56,332
他们居然不理我 玛丽也跑了
They ran away from me. Even Mary.

459
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:59,756
你不会还想当一只老鼠吧
Now surely you don't miss
being a mouse.

460
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:02,505
不会我想不会吧
No, I guess not.

461
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,927
你当人不快乐吗
Aren't you happy being human?

462
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:08,723
快乐 可是没有我想得这么容易
Yeah. Sure not as easy as I thought.

463
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:13,929
我会撑下去的
But I know I'll get it.

464
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:19,192
仙度瑞拉王妃殿下正在找您
Cinderella is asking for you.

465
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:21,736
嘉年华会就要开始了
The evening's festivities are upon us.

466
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:28,284
啧啧
杰克
-Zug-zug!
-Jaq?

467
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:32,910
啧啧，爵士，我对这个名词并不很熟悉
Zug-zug, eh? I don't believe
I'm familiar with that expression.

468
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:36,118
那当然，那是法文
It means... It's French.

469
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:39,830
法文是吗
这就难怪了
French, is it?
Well, that explains everything.

470
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,714
各位先生、女士
春季嘉年华会正式开始
Ladies and gentlemen,

好好玩
-I'll race you to the Ferris wheel!
-Look there.

472
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,983
我要去看小丑
Hi, kids!

473
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:13,113
有大象，走啊
我最喜欢大象了
An elephant! Come on!
I just love elephants!

474
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:15,870
国王陛下，我…
走
-Your Majesty...
-Let's go!

475
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:19,286
各位仔细看
你们会不会啊
Around the world!

476
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:24,249
我厉不厉害，你看看
Up and down. Up and down.
Around like a Ferris wheel.

477
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:27,006
玛丽，你确定杰克在这里吗
Are you sure Jaq-Jaq's here, Mary?

478
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,758
葛斯，他一定在 我们去找他
He must be, Gus. Let's find him.

479
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:35,431
休爵士，玩得还愉快吗
Sir Hugh, are you enjoying yourself?

480
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:38,605
我…有件事我…
Well, there's something...

481
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:42,604
你不是要说我的悄悄话吧，爵士
You're not whispering
about me, are you?

482
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:45,402
我答应要请你们两位来开舞的
I believe I promised you two
the first dance.

483
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,743
你跳得多可爱，天啊
What a lovely dancer. Oh, my!

484
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:09,461
休爵士！
Sir Hugh!

485
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:11,672
这是你的小猫咪吗
Is that your kitty?

486
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,845
真的很可爱
Isn't she precious?

487
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,398
准备跳下一支舞了吗
Ready for the next dance?

488
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:51,757
乖乖猫
Nice kitty.

489
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:09,024
我讨厌大象
I hate elephants!

490
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:13,900
停下来
Stop!

491
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:20,415
这全是我的错
我真希望神仙教母在这里
This is all my fault!
Wish Fairy Godmother was here.

492
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:26,041
杰克，这是你可以帮忙的机会了
Jaq, this is your chance to help.

493
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,713
我能做什么
What can I do?

494
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:32,586
哦！一只大象
你想什么可以阻止大象啊
An elephant.
What do you think could stop him?

495
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:35,547
我命令你停下来
我不知道
-Stop in the name of the King!
-Don't know.

496
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:38,179
比方说一只老鼠
Perhaps a mouse?

497
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:42,895
所有的大象好像都怕老鼠
Aren't all elephants afraid of mice?

498
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:47,768
你是个人，还是老鼠
Are you a man or a mouse?

499
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,990
我是一只老鼠
I'm a mouse!

500
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,958
坐下，坐下
Sit down, sit down.

501
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:02,581
老天啊
Oh, dear, now!

502
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,961
别动，别动
Hold it, Hold it.

503
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,963
这咒语怎么念的
How does it go again?

504
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,966
停下来
Stop.

505
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:09,967
停下来
Stop.

506
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,545
对了，
Oh, yes!

507
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:14,211
大变身布
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

508
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:19,302
救命啊
Help!

509
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:26,481
我可以看到我的城堡
I can see my castle!

510
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:37,317
只有老鼠才办得到的
我猜有些事
I guess there are some things
only a mouse can do.

511
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,326
我是只老鼠
I'm a mouse!

512
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,205
对，我是只老鼠
Yes! I'm a mouse!

513
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,080
我好高兴我是只老鼠
我是只老鼠
I'm a mouse! I'm so glad I'm a mouse!

514
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:50,663
杰克回来了
I'm a mouse! Jaq is back!
I'm a mouse! A mouse!

515
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:53,500
我是只小老鼠
我是只老鼠，我是只老鼠
M-O-U-S-E. I'm a mousie mousie!

516
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:57,178
是休爵士的小猫咪
Sir Hugh's kitty!

517
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:02,634
来吧，甜心
我们去找你的主人
Come, sweetums.
Let's go find your master.

518
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:06,847
你真是最可爱最宝贝的小东西
Aren't you just the sweetest,
little, most precious baby?

519
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,811
杰克，你刚刚好勇敢
Jaq, that was so brave!

520
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:15,396
玛丽，我真的好想你
Mary, I really missed you.

521
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:17,482
你真是英雄
You're a hero!

522
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:21,741
杰克，你救了大家
每次需要你的时候
Jaq, you saved the day!
I can always count on you.

523
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:24,163
你就在我身边，真好
是吗
-You're right there when I need you.
-I am?

524
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,241
是啊，真的
Yes, you are.

525
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,207
我好高兴你回来了
I'm so glad you're back!

526
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:34,924
我也是
Me, too!

527
00:42:56,616 --> 00:43:00,108
谢天谢地结束了
是啊
-Thank goodness that's over.
-Yeah.

528
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:03,070
杰克再也不需要魔法
No more magic for Jaq-Jaq!

529
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:05,530
一点点也不要吗
哇
-Not even a little?
-Whoa!

530
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,628
魔法可以让书快点完成
Hey, magic make this go a lot faster!

531
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,095
去工作了
Let's go to work.

532
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:45,160
我的老天啊
完了
-Good gracious!
-Oh, no!

533
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:48,744
我正在缝呢
我被泼了一身
-I'm trying to sew.
-I'm splattered!

534
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:51,417
真是可怕
现在怎么办
-How awful!
-It's tragic!

535
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:54,086
我觉得有点头晕
小心我的尾巴
-I feel a bit pale.
-Watch out! That's my tail!

536
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:56,505
不好，我们用的魔法太多了
I think we've had quite enough magic.

537
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:04,885
真是一团糟
-What a mess!
-It's a mess, all right.

538
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:06,136
就是嘛，乱七八糟
非常乱七八糟
A big, stinky mess.

539
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:08,343
对啊
我们碰过更糟的
-We've seen worse!
-Yeah.

540
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,519
记得安泰西亚恋爱的时候吗
Remember when Anastasia fell in love?

541
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,096
我记得
I sure do.

542
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:15,433
仙度瑞拉的姐姐
那个安泰西亚
Cinderella's stepsister?
That Anastasia?

543
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:18,361
那个故事真是一团糟
对
-Yeah!
-Now that's a messy story.

544
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:21,189
不对，那是一个爱情故事
No. It's a love story.

545
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,963
鲁斯佛
Lucifer!

546
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:53,722
别再占着镜子不放
Stop hogging the mirror!

547
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,101
那是我的
不对，是我的
-That's mine!
-No! It's mine!

548
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:01,108
不对，是我的
不对，那是我的
-No! Mine!
-Hey! That's mine!

549
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:05,236
你说的对
Oh, you're right.

550
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:08,866
还给你好了
你是故意这样的
-It is yours.
-You did that on purpose!

551
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:10,571
才不是呢
是
-Did not!
-Did too!

552
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:11,701
才不是
绝对是
-Did not!
-Did too.

553
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:15,831
女儿们，不准你们这样吵架
Girls, stop all this bick ering at once!

554
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:19,756
仙度瑞拉的舞会明天晚上举行
所以注意听好
Cinderella's ball is tomorrow night,
so pay attention!

555
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:23,342
国内所有的单身贵族都会到场
Every noble bachelor
in the kingdom will be there.

556
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:28,640
如果你们想找到丈夫
你们就必须好好的利用这个好机会
lf you want to find a husband, you have
to mak e the most of this opportunity.

557
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,934
你们不准再让我失望，懂吗
I won't let you fail me, again.

558
00:45:32,772 --> 00:45:34,728
是的，妈妈
-Yes, Mother.
-Yes, Mother.

559
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:37,352
崔西里亚，脸上再扑点粉
Drizella, pin back those curls.

560
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:41,061
安泰西亚，腮红再加深一点
Anastasia, put more colour
in your cheeks!

561
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:45,899
完美的外表
是吸引合格绅士唯一的办法
A perfect appearance is the only way
to attract a proper gentleman.

562
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:49,861
我一定要替你们找到有钱
有势的贵族
We shall find you
men of wealth and nobility.

563
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:52,739
或者是公爵
也许是个伯爵
-Maybe a count.
-Or a duke.

564
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,744
一点也没错，过来吧
Precisely.

565
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:57,793
我们一起去添几件新衣服
Come along now.
We need new gowns for the both of you.

566
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:01,422
还有珠宝
还有新鞋子
-With new shoes.
-And jewellery.

567
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:04,967
越时髦越好 鲁斯佛，来
The fancier the better. Lucifer, come.

568
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:08,630
鲁斯佛
Lucifer!

569
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:24,612
早安，仙度瑞拉
为什么打扮成这样
Morning, Cinderelly!
Why you dressed like that?

570
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:27,941
我想装成平民去市场逛逛
让大家认不出我
I'm going to the market in disguise
so no one will recognise me.

571
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:31,448
顺便还要买个花环
给王子一个惊喜
I want to surprise the Prince
with a garland of flowers.

572
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:34,656
好耶…
一起来吧
-Want to come along?
-Oh, yeah. Let's go!

573
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,240
葛斯也要去
Gus-Gus come along.

574
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,979
记得这个传统
Remember the tradition.

575
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:08,106
在舞会上送花环给对方
你们就会长相厮守
Give these to each other at the ball,
and you'll always be together.

576
00:47:09,702 --> 00:47:12,444
你要不要买个玫瑰花环
去参加舞会啊
Don't you need
a garland of roses for the ball?

577
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:18,453
保证你可以赢得他的心
Guaranteed to win you his heart.

578
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,956
安泰西亚，你在做什么
Anastasia, what are you doing?

579
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:23,709
没什么，我来了
Nothing. Coming.

580
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:05,334
你烤的这些面包闻起来好香哦
Everything smells so good.

581
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:08,882
小心，还很烫
你想吃一个吗
Would you like one?
Be carefuI. They're hot.

582
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:13,679
安泰西亚，我们可以走了
Anastasia, I think not.

583
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:18,226
这店里所有的东西都很廉价
Everything in this shop is inferior.

584
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,770
去盖房子了
你可以用这些硬面包
You can build a house
out of these bricks.

585
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,893
安泰西亚，快来
Come along, Anastasia.

586
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:32,024
一个卖面包的师傅
你跟他说什么
You're not to say a word
to that shopk eeper.

587
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:34,905
我绝对不答应
是的，妈妈
-I forbid it!
-Yes, Mother.

588
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:38,537
看他的表情
He's got that look,

589
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,036
我看过那种神情
and I know that look.

590
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:43,117
晕船了
Seasick?

591
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:49,416
这不好笑 我想他们恋爱了
Oh, very funny. I think they're in love.

592
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:53,219
安泰西亚恋爱
怎么可能，仙度瑞拉
Anastasia's in love?
That's crazy, Cinderelly!

593
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:56,638
拜托，你们两个
任何人都会恋爱
Come on, you two.
Anyone can fall in love.

594
00:48:56,976 --> 00:48:59,308
安泰西亚例外
Anyone but Anastasia.

595
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:04,143
也许她需要小小的帮忙
对，很大的帮忙
-Maybe she just needs some help.
-Yeah, lots of help.

596
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:07,316
当初你们也帮了我很多的忙
记得吗
Well, I had lots of help, too, remember?

597
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:12,400
我们必须想办法
让他们再碰一次面
We have to figure out
how to get them together again.

598
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:17,827
对了，把他们引到广场
我们就这么做，
I know! We'll lure them into the square,
and here's how we'll do it.

599
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:19,244
小鸟去抢她的帽子
The birds will get her hat.

600
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:21,743
你们去引面包师注意
带安泰西亚回来
Get the baker's attention.
Bring Anastasia here.

601
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:24,917
他们会在店门口碰面
把面包师引出来
Get the baker outside.
They'll meet in front of the shop.

602
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:29,497
对啊，葛斯
绝对神不知鬼不觉
That's right, Gus.
They'll never know what hit them.

603
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:40,223
-嗨
-好的，伙计们...
-Hey.
-Okay, fellas...

604
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:43,053
引起他的注意，好了，各位
记得要做得俐落一点
Get his attention, and remember,
keep it simple.

605
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:11,664
老鼠在我的面包里
Mice in my baguettes!

606
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:21,469
鲁斯佛
Lucifey!

607
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:33,110
回来啊
讨厌的东西
Come back here!
Filthy creatures!

608
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:54,418
你还好吗
Are you okay?

609
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,343
真糗
Oh, no!

610
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:20,449
安泰西亚
Anastasia?

611
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:25,701
你来这里做什么
还穿成那样
What are you doing here
dressed like that?

612
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:28,157
你看起来像个洗衣女工
You look like a laundry maid.

613
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,501
脸上有蛋的人可不是我
I'm not the one with egg on my face.

614
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:38,713
我看到你在面包店的事了
I saw you in the baker's shop.

615
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,128
他一定认为我…
He must think I'm...

616
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:47,601
他会认为这是一个意外
还有别这么快就放弃
He saw it was an accident.
Don't give up so fast.

617
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:51,397
你知道些什么
你长得那么漂亮
What would you know?
You're beautiful.

618
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:53,769
对你一切向来都很轻松
It's always been easy for you.

619
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:57,228
轻松？我记得的可不是这样
Easy? That's not how I remember it.

620
00:51:57,323 --> 00:52:00,941
安泰西亚
你只是需要帮忙罢了
Look, Anastasia, you just need
a little help, that's all.

621
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:03,742
要是我没有那么笨手笨脚
lf I weren't so clumsy and plain...

622
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:06,115
别急，你跟我一起回皇宫
Listen, why don't you
come back to the castle?

623
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,406
先把你洗干净
然后让你们两个再见一次面
We'll clean you up
and then we'll get you two together.

624
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:14,078
但是妈妈禁止这样
她认为他配不上我
But Mother forbids it!
She thinks he's beneath me.

625
00:52:14,173 --> 00:52:17,586
可是我认为她错了
那个面包师很棒
And I think she's wrong.
The baker's terrific.

626
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:19,337
而且他还会做菜
And he cooks, too.

627
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:43,839
鲁斯佛喜欢庞庞对吧
Lucifey like Pom-Pom, yes?

628
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:49,014
老鼠可以帮忙，不过
鲁斯佛要保证不再追老鼠
Mice can help if Lucifey promise
to stop chasing mice!

629
00:53:49,101 --> 00:53:50,136
成交吗
Deal?

630
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:04,696
好了，跟新的一样好
还不要停啊
-There. Good as new.
-Don't stop now!

631
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:07,490
妈妈说过外表比一切都重要
Mother says that looks
count for everything.

632
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:10,695
你当然要表现最好的一面
Well, of course you want to
look your best,

633
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,700
但是这一点并不是最重要的
but that's not the most important thing.

634
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:15,999
对，我需要的是全新的面貌
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What I need is a whole new look.

635
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,669
让我迷人
让我变辣
Make me look good
make me look swell

636
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:21,748
让我好看
Make me look fine

637
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:25,793
我使出全力
We're pourin' it on, you just sit back

638
00:54:25,888 --> 00:54:29,096
你放轻松等看我打扮
'Cause, baby, you're mine

639
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:32,346
改变我焕然一新
You send me into a spin

640
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:35,348
挥挥手出现眼前
Make a splash when you waIk in

641
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:39,398
可爱红唇秀发迷人
Those eyes so rare, the Iips, the hair

642
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:41,521
国色天香佳人
You're a breath of fresh air

643
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:46,446
理理胡须
刷刷毛发
Brushing the fur, comb the hair out

644
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,524
修修指甲
Trim up the toes

645
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,944
换上洋装和新鞋
Give me the dress and the shoes

646
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:55,623
戴钻戒和发夹
And the jewellery and clothes

647
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:58,621
人不可貌相，海水不可斗量
You can judge your books
from how the cover looks

648
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:02,079
看我锐不可档
Wear makeup by the ounce

649
00:55:02,174 --> 00:55:07,339
但千万记住内在美能发光
But didn't they tell you
it's what's inside that counts?

650
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:10,296
让我潇洒
让我漂亮
Make me a star, make me look great

651
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:13,473
让我高贵
Make me look grand

652
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,643
我优雅又出色
虽然我浓妆艳抹
I've got style and grace
but it's a painted-up face

653
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,312
我会成功
Gets you a man

654
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:22,433
修剪结束之后
Snip, cut, when we are through

655
00:55:22,528 --> 00:55:25,395
让他人惊艳直发抖
You're gonna look so good, it's true

656
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:28,652
毛发、花夹、下巴、脚爪
The fur, the bows, the chin, the nose

657
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:31,828
呜啦啦
Oooh lala!

658
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:37,290
藏不住内在美会发光
Looks won't hide
it's what's inside that counts

659
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:43,372
你想当个新娘
内在美会发光
You wanna be a bride
it's what's inside that counts

660
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:45,789
戴一条项链怎么样
What about a necklace?

661
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:51,838
鲁斯佛
大笨猫
-Lucifer!
-Stupid cat.

662
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:58,644
用蜂蜜会比醋吸引更多的苍蝇
请记住
Remember, you'll catch more flies
with honey than with vinegar.

663
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:01,813
这是什么意思
谁会想吸引苍蝇
What does that mean?
Who'd want to catch flies?

664
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:06,735
想赢得面包师的好感
我是说最棒的方式就是对他好
I mean the best way to impress
the bak er is just to be nice to him.

665
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:11,407
那我要怎么做
你可以从微笑开始
-How do I do that?
-You could start with a smile.

666
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:13,825
还是给我大一点的项链
Better get me a bigger necklace.

667
00:56:17,249 --> 00:56:18,489
笑一个
Come on.

668
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:43,514
婴儿都会被我吓哭的
来
-I mak e babies cry, too.
-Here.

669
00:56:47,446 --> 00:56:49,687
他绝对没有办法抗拒的
He'll never be able to resist.

670
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:51,271
是这样吗
You think so?

671
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:54,528
万一被妈妈抓到了那我怎么办
But what if Mother catches me?

672
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:57,783
她警告我不准跟面包师说话的
She told me never to speak
to the baker again!

673
00:56:57,873 --> 00:57:00,535
你该学着
不要事事都听别人的
It's time to stop following
someone else's orders

674
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:03,368
应该多听听自己的意思
and start following your heart.

675
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:06,870
现在很晚了，我要走了
It's late! I have to go!

676
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,956
那面包师怎么办
But what about the baker?

677
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:13,627
我可以陪你去他的店里
I could walk you to his shop.

678
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:16,930
明天中午到市场见罗
Meet you in the mark et
at noon tomorrow?

679
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:18,678
我已经快等不及了
I can hardly wait!

680
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:35,379
妈妈，我要到城里一趟
我们没有面包了
Mother, I have to run to town.
We're out of bread.

681
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:37,381
嗨！
Hey!

682
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,380
对不起，马车借我 谢谢
Excuse me. Can I borrow this? Thanks!

683
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:45,010
小姐，等一等
Mademoiselle. Senorita.
Just a moment.

684
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:19,924
我在水果店旁边等你
I'll wait for you by the apple cart.

685
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:32,316
你想她会喜欢吗
好漂亮！她一定会很喜欢的
-Do you think she'll like them?
-They're beautiful! She'll love them!

686
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,669
怎么？怎么了？
What? What happened?

687
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:05,882
安泰西亚！
Anastasia!

688
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:32,059
快逃命啊
Run for it!

689
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:58,286
交易取消了
The deal is off!

690
01:02:53,061 --> 01:02:55,803
不要看我！我的样子一定很糟！
Don't look at me! I look horrible!

691
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:58,225
别走，等一下
Wait! Please!

692
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,831
安泰西亚
Anastasia!

693
01:03:21,423 --> 01:03:24,460
你居然敢不听我的话
How dare you defy me?

694
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:27,008
我禁止你跟那个人说话的
You were forbidden
to speak to this man!

695
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:30,758
你看她！实在是土到家了！
Look at her! It's a disaster!

696
01:03:30,849 --> 01:03:33,841
我们一定会变成
所有人的笑柄的
We'll be the laughingstock
of the entire town.

697
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:38,562
你的这些愚蠢行为
已经害你丢脸丢到家了
You've embarrassed yourself
quite enough with this foolishness.

698
01:03:40,025 --> 01:03:44,940
亲爱的，你应该知道
我全心全意都是为了你们好
Dear child, you know I only have
your best interests at heart.

699
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:47,772
他哪配的上你，跟我走
You deserve better. Come along.

700
01:03:47,866 --> 01:03:50,653
我不走，妈，你错了
No, Mother! You're wrong!

701
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:55,613
他很体帖
她很完美
-He's sweet.
-She's wonderful.

702
01:03:55,707 --> 01:04:00,542
他很浪漫
而且我们要一起去参加皇宫舞会
He's romantic.
And we are going to the ball together.

703
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:11,302
崔西里亚，我们走

我从来没想到我会这么开心
Thank you!

709
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:30,044
葛斯，你的蝴蝶结呢
