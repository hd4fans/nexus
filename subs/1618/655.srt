他受到打击。 但我想
earlier this year, but I really think...

他会度过难关的！
that he's starting to turn a corner.

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,293
长官，我是不是可以说一句？
Officers, if I might, uh, interject here.

103
00:06:38,338 --> 00:06:41,771
我是著名的物理学家， 德尔波特·多普勒博士
I am the noted astrophysicist Dr. Delbert Doppler.

104

你们应该听说过我
Perhaps you've heard of me.

105

不知道？嗯，我这里有个剪报！

111
00:06:57,152 --> 00:06:59,618
啊咳，以后别让我这么做了
Ahem. Don't ever let me do that again.

112
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,744
由于他再三违反15C条例
Due to repeated violations of statute 1 5-C...

113
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,780

00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:19,298
-好自为之！ -我们走！
-You take care now. -Let's motor.

121
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:29,243
吉姆，我早就跟你说过了！
Jim, I have had it.

122
00:07:29,278 --> 00:07:31,574
你真的想去少管所？ 是不是？
Do you want to go to Juvenile Hall? Is that it?

123
00:07:32,712 --> 00:07:34,976
吉姆？
Jim?

124
00:07:35,016 --> 00:07:36,641
吉姆，看着我！
Jim, look at me.

125
00:07:36,683 --> 00:07:38,673
我辛辛苦苦维持这个旅馆
It's been hard enough keeping this place...

126
00:07:38,717 --> 00:07:40,582
全是我一个人忙呼， 你做过什么？
afloat by myself without you going--

127
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,813
妈妈，别大惊小怪的！ 一直都是你一个人！
Mom, it's no big deal. There was nobody around.

128
00:07:42,854 --> 00:07:45,551
那些警察只是把我的车子拿走了
Those cops just won't get off my--

129
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:49,389
算了吧
Forget it.

130

132
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:56,426
吉姆，我只是不想看到你...
Jim, I just don't want to see you...

133
00:07:56,465 --> 00:07:59,592
放弃自己的将来
throw away your entire future.

134
00:08:01,635 --> 00:08:03,569
将来, 什么将来？
Yeah, what future?

135
00:08:14,714 --> 00:08:17,703
难以想象你是怎么维持下来的，莎拉
I really don't know how you manage it. Sarah.

136
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,477
要经营生意， 还要带大一个像
Trying to run a business while raising a felon like--

137
00:08:20,518 --> 00:08:24,351
像吉姆这样的孩子
felon...fellow... fellow like Jim.

138
00:08:24,386 --> 00:08:27,254
维持？ 我已经没办法了
Managing it? I'm at the end of my rope.

139
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:29,189
对他父亲的离开
Ever since his father left...

140
00:08:29,226 --> 00:08:32,715
吉姆一直都耿耿于怀
well. Jim's just never recovered.

141
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:34,990
你知道他有多聪明的
And you know how smart he is.

142
00:08:35,028 --> 00:08:39,054
他八岁的时候 做了第一个太阳能滑板
He built his first solar surfer when he was eight!

143
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:41,531
之后，他就没上过学
And yet. he's failing at school...

144
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:43,626
他不断地惹麻烦
he is constantly in trouble...

145
00:08:43,668 --> 00:08:46,466
跟他说话的时候， 他就像个陌生人
and when I talk to him. he's like a stranger to me.

146
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:49,302
我不知道为什么。德尔波特， 我已经尽力了！
I don't know. Delbert. I've tried everything--

147
00:08:58,382 --> 00:08:59,847
嗨，先生！
Hey, Mister?

148
00:08:59,882 --> 00:09:01,781
罐子里的先生，你还好吗？
Mister,

149
00:09:01,816 --> 00:09:03,307
啊——！
Aah!

150
00:09:06,387 --> 00:09:08,014
他马上来了
He's a-comin'.

151
00:09:08,054 --> 00:09:10,022
你听到他说话了吗？
Can you hear him?

152
00:09:10,056 --> 00:09:13,047
那些齿轮和陀螺呼呼的转着
Those gears and gyros clickin' and whirrin'...

153
00:09:13,093 --> 00:09:14,753
就像那个恶魔一样！
Iike the devil himself!

154
00:09:14,793 --> 00:09:17,693
哦，撞晕头了？
Uh, hit your head there pretty hard, didn't ya?

155
00:09:17,729 --> 00:09:19,322
他来抢我的箱子
He's after me chest...

156
00:09:19,365 --> 00:09:23,697
那个残忍的机器人 还有他的屠杀部队
that fiendish cyborg and his band of cutthroats.

157
00:09:25,434 --> 00:09:27,061
但是他们必须
But they'll have to pry it...

158
00:09:27,104 --> 00:09:33,236
先从比利·鲍恩斯冰冷的 死人的手指中探察
from old Billy Bones' cold, dead fingers afore l--argh!

159
00:09:34,911 --> 00:09:36,376
哦，我的...
Oh, my--

160
00:09:36,411 --> 00:09:39,108
哦，来吧，把胳膊给我
Uh, come on, give me your arm.

161
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:41,879
对了
That's it.

162
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,810
-好孩子。 -我这么做妈妈会很高兴的
-Good lad. -Mom's gonna love this.

163
00:09:55,859 --> 00:09:58,988
德尔波特，感谢您听你我唠叨。
Thanks for listening, Delbert.

164
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:02,226
我好多了
It helps.

165
00:10:04,633 --> 00:10:07,829
一切都会好的
It's going to be OK.

166
00:10:07,869 --> 00:10:09,633
放心吧
You'll see.

167
00:10:09,671 --> 00:10:12,333
我一直希望， 有一天我打开门...
I keep dreaming one day I'll open that door...

168
00:10:12,372 --> 00:10:14,999
他会像以前一样
and there he'll be just the way he was.

169
00:10:15,042 --> 00:10:18,373
一个开朗、快乐的男孩， 抱着一只新宠物...
A smiling, happy little boy, holding a new pet...

170
00:10:18,411 --> 00:10:21,073
让我允许收留它
and begging me to let him keep it.

171
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,006
詹姆斯·普莱迪斯·霍金斯
James Pleiades Hawkins!

172
00:10:26,051 --> 00:10:28,280
妈妈，他受伤了 伤得很重
Mom, he's hurt...bad!

173
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,979
我的箱子，小伙子
Me chest, lad.

174
00:10:36,124 --> 00:10:38,355
他马上就来了
He'll be comin' soon.

175
00:10:39,728 --> 00:10:42,218
不能让他找到这东西
Can't let them find this.

176
00:10:42,263 --> 00:10:43,593
谁要来？
Who's coming?

177
00:10:43,631 --> 00:10:46,724
机器人！
The cyborg!

178
00:10:46,766 --> 00:10:51,361
小心那机器人！
Beware the cyborg!

179
00:10:58,177 --> 00:10:59,335
哦！
Ohh!

180
00:11:11,987 --> 00:11:13,386
快！我们必须马上离开这儿！
Quick! We gotta go!

181
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,650
-哦！ -啊！
-Ohh! -Aah!

182
00:11:15,689 --> 00:11:17,815
我想这时候我离不开吉姆了！
I believe I'm with Jim on this one!

183
00:11:28,935 --> 00:11:30,594
黛利拉！（原是圣经中人物） 哈利路亚！
Delilah! Hallelujah!

184
00:11:31,801 --> 00:11:32,996
呆在那儿！ 别动！
Stay! Don't move!

185
00:11:33,037 --> 00:11:34,903
那东西呢？
Where is it?!

186
00:11:34,939 --> 00:11:36,564
把它找出来！
Find it!

187
00:11:36,605 --> 00:11:37,936
不用担心，莎拉！
Don't worry. Sarah.

188
00:11:37,973 --> 00:11:40,203
我是个物理学专家
I'm an expert in the laws of physical science.

189
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,299
-我们数到三。一... -三！
-On the count of three--one... -Three!

190
00:11:42,342 --> 00:11:44,833
-啊！ -啊！
-Aah! -Aah!

191
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,506
快，黛利拉，快！
Go, Delilah! Go!

192
00:11:46,546 --> 00:11:49,879
快走！对极了！快！
Go! That's it! That's it! Go!

193
00:11:56,122 --> 00:11:57,316
驾！驾！
Hyah! Hyah!

194
00:12:11,253 --> 00:12:13,915
我跟警察说了
I just spoke with the constabulary.

195
00:12:13,956 --> 00:12:17,015
那些海盗逃走的时候 没有留下任何线索！
Those blaggard pirates have fled without a trace.

196
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,049
我很难过，莎拉！
I'm sorry, Sarah.

197
00:12:20,093 --> 00:12:24,188
我想老本鲍旅馆已经化为灰烬了
I'm afraid the old Benbow lnn has burned to the ground.

198
00:12:28,668 --> 00:12:34,531
对了， 都是那个小球带来的麻烦！
Ahem. Well, certainly a lot of trouble...over that odd little sphere.

199
00:12:34,572 --> 00:12:37,267
那些标记看起来挺奇怪的
Those markings baffle me.

200
00:12:37,307 --> 00:12:39,467
我从没见过像这样的东西
Unlike anything I've ever encountered.

201
00:12:40,678 --> 00:12:42,109
就是以我丰富的经验
Even with my vast experience...

202
00:12:42,143 --> 00:12:43,610
和惊人的智慧
and superior intellect...

203
00:12:43,644 --> 00:12:46,738
都得花好几年才能打开它
it would take me years to unlock its--hey!

204
00:12:49,917 --> 00:12:53,681
什么？是张地图！
Why, it's a map!

205
00:12:54,988 --> 00:12:56,180
等等！等等！
Wait. Wait, wait, wait!

206
00:12:56,222 --> 00:12:59,157
这是我们，在特雷斯普行星
This is us,

207
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:03,985
那是麦哲伦云层
That's the Magellanic Cloud!

208
00:13:04,028 --> 00:13:06,120
哦！珊瑚星系！
Whoo! The Coral Galaxy!

209
00:13:06,162 --> 00:13:07,254
哦！
Oh!

210
00:13:07,297 --> 00:13:09,424
那是天鹅星座！
That's the Cygnus Cross...

211
00:13:09,465 --> 00:13:11,899
克里安黑洞！
and that's the Kerian Abyss.

212
00:13:11,934 --> 00:13:15,369
等等！这是什么？这是什么？ 奇怪，它是...
Wait. What's this? What's this? Why, it--it's...

213
00:13:15,404 --> 00:13:17,234
星银岛！
Treasure Planet.

214
00:13:17,271 --> 00:13:18,636
不！
No!

215
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,606
是星银岛！
That's Treasure Planet!

216
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,302
弗林特的宝藏？
Flint's trove?

217
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,311
掠夺上千个世界的战利品？
The loot of a thousand worlds?

218
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,972
你知道这意味着什么吗？
You know what this means?

219
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:29,468
就是说所有的财宝只是在一艘船上。
It means that all that treasure is only a boat ride away.

220
00:13:29,514 --> 00:13:33,043
有了它就有了全世界
Whoever brings it back would hold an eternal place...

221
00:13:33,086 --> 00:13:36,611
高高的站在万神殿上受万人朝拜！ 想必他就是这样！
atop the pantheon of explorers! He'd be able to experience--

222
00:13:36,653 --> 00:13:39,054
哦！刚才怎么了？
Whoo! What just happened?

223
00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:42,148
妈妈，就是这个！ 这是所有问题的答案！
Mom, this is it. This is

224
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,420
吉姆，这绝对不可能！
Jim, there is

225
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:47,019
您还记得那些故事吗？
Don't you remember, all those stories?

226
00:13:47,062 --> 00:13:49,895
就是了，他们只是故事！
That's all they were--stories!

227
00:13:49,932 --> 00:13:51,057
有了那些财宝
With that treasure...

228
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:53,724
我们可以建造数百个本鲍旅馆
we could rebuild the Benbow a hundred times over!

229
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,463
哦，这是...这到底是...
Well, this is--

230
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,903
德尔波特，你可以解释这个荒谬的事情？
Delbert, would you please explain how ridiculous this is?

231
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:01,235
真是太荒谬了
It's totally preposterous...

232
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:03,299
一个人穿过整个星系
traversing the entire galaxy alone.

233
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,400
好了，现在乖乖呆在这儿吧
Now at last,

234
00:14:05,443 --> 00:14:08,071
-所以我要和你一起去！ -德尔波特！
-That's why I'm going with you. -Delbert!

235
00:14:08,111 --> 00:14:10,511
用我的积蓄来作为探险队的费用
I'll use my savings to finance the expedition.

236
00:14:10,547 --> 00:14:14,005
我要搞艘船， 雇一个船长还有一个水手队！
I'll commission a ship, hire a captain and a crew.

237
00:14:14,051 --> 00:14:15,346
你不是认真的吧？
You're not serious.

238
00:14:15,385 --> 00:14:17,979
我这辈子就等这么个机会了
All my life I've been waiting for an opportunity like this...

239
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,456
我听到了一个声音： “前进吧，德尔波特！前进吧，德尔波特”
and here it is screaming, "Go, Delbert! Go, Delbert!"

240
00:14:21,489 --> 00:14:24,616
好了，好了！ 你们两个都疯了！
OK. OK! You're both grounded!

241
00:14:25,893 --> 00:14:27,791
妈妈，你看
Mom. Iook...

242
00:14:27,827 --> 00:14:31,354
我知道我让这里乱七八糟的
I know that I keep messing everything up...

243
00:14:31,398 --> 00:14:34,128
我知道
and I know...

244
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:36,156
我让你失望
that I let you down.

245
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,833
但这是我向你证明我自己的机会
But this is my chance to make it up to you.

246
00:14:40,872 --> 00:14:43,532
我会把一切处理的妥妥当当的
I'm gonna set things right.

247
00:14:43,573 --> 00:14:46,303
莎拉？
Sarah?

248
00:14:46,342 --> 00:14:48,536
可以吗？
If I may?

249
00:14:48,577 --> 00:14:51,011
你说你已经没办法了
You said yourself, you've tried everything.

250
00:14:51,047 --> 00:14:52,673
没有比在太空中锻炼的几个月
There are much worse remedies...

251
00:14:52,714 --> 00:14:55,842
更好的补救方法了
than a few character-building months in space.

252
00:14:55,884 --> 00:14:58,679
你这么说是因为 这么做是对的
Are you saying this because it's the right thing...

253
00:14:58,718 --> 00:15:00,981
还是因为你真的想去？
or because you really want to go?

254
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,749
真的，真的，真的， 真的想去
I really, really, really, really want to go...

255
00:15:03,789 --> 00:15:05,722
而且这么做是对的！
and it's the right thing.

256
00:15:13,197 --> 00:15:14,390
吉姆
Jim...

257
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:17,092
我不想失去你
I don't want to lose you.

258
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:20,659
妈妈，我也舍不得
Mom...you won't.

259
00:15:20,703 --> 00:15:22,864
我不会让你失望的
I'll make you proud.

260
00:15:24,438 --> 00:15:26,464
好了，哦
Well. uh. ahem.

261
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,065
我们这不是在一起吗？
There we are then.

262
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,343
我们马上开始准备
We'll begin preparations at once.

263
00:15:30,344 --> 00:15:30,743
我们马上开始准备
We'll begin preparations at once.

264
00:15:30,777 --> 00:15:35,076
吉姆，我的孩子， 我们马上要升上太空了
Jim, my boy, soon we'll be off to the spaceport.

265
00:16:15,646 --> 00:16:18,581
吉姆，等等我！
Jim! Oh. Jim! Wait for me!

266
00:16:25,254 --> 00:16:28,450
哦，吉姆，我们
Well, Jim, this should be

267
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,649
应该好好的互相了解一下
for the two of us to get to know one another.

268
00:16:30,691 --> 00:16:33,057
你知道他们说什么， 亲情沟通，呣
You know what they say, familiarity breeds, um...

269
00:16:33,094 --> 00:16:35,060
这样说不太礼貌 但是，在我么看来...
well, contempt, but, in our case--

270
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:39,190
走吧，找找我们的船！
Look, let's just find the ship. OK?

271
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:43,915
-你右手边的第二个泊位！ -你可以找到的！
-Second berth on your right! -You can't miss it.

272
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:46,226
嘿，谢谢！
Hey, thanks.

273
00:16:46,263 --> 00:16:48,857
合适吗？
It's the suit, isn't it?

274
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:51,264
那个可恶的女店员！
to that pushy two-headed saleswoman.

275
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,631
这个说合适！
This one said it fit,

276
00:16:53,668 --> 00:16:56,693
哦不知道该怎么办。 我都有些混乱了！哦！
I didn't know what to do. I get so flustered. Ooh!

277
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,566
欧，吉姆！这是我们的船！ R.L.S.的遗产！
Oh, Jim! This is our ship! The R.L.S. Legacy!

278
00:17:06,345 --> 00:17:08,211
哇！
Whoa!

279
00:17:09,616 --> 00:17:12,641
把这些桶搬上去！
Stow those casks forward!

280
00:17:12,683 --> 00:17:15,152
拉上去！
Heave together now!

281
00:17:15,186 --> 00:17:18,018
太酷了！
How cool is this?

282
00:17:19,256 --> 00:17:21,053
对不起，我是说...
Sorry about that. I didn't mean--

283
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,689
让我来
Allow me to handle this.

284
00:17:35,836 --> 00:17:37,268
吉姆，我的弗拉图拉语很流利！
I'm fluent in Flatula, Jim.

285
00:17:37,303 --> 00:17:38,930
我在大学里学了两年！
Took two years of it in high school.

286
00:17:40,406 --> 00:17:43,203
弗拉图拉？太酷了！
Flatula? Cool.

287
00:17:44,508 --> 00:17:47,500
早上好，船长！ 都准备好了吗？
Good morning, Captain. Everything shipshape?

288
00:17:47,545 --> 00:17:51,173
都准备好了，先生！ 但是我不是船长！
Shipshape it is, sir, but I'm not the captain.

289
00:17:51,214 --> 00:17:53,044
船长在上面！
The captain's aloft.

290
00:18:00,021 --> 00:18:02,216
埃柔先生，我已经
Mr. Arrow, I've checked

291
00:18:02,257 --> 00:18:06,692
上上下下检查过了
from stem to stern,

292
00:18:06,726 --> 00:18:08,750
你怎么都不会出点错？
Can you get nothing wrong?

293
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,160
您过讲了，船长
You flatter me, Captain.

294
00:18:12,998 --> 00:18:16,093
啊，多普勒博士，我没认错吧？
Ah, Dr. Doppler, I presume?

295
00:18:16,135 --> 00:18:17,930
哦，是的，我...
Uh, um, yes. I--

296
00:18:17,969 --> 00:18:21,200
-你好啊，你能听到我说话吗？ -是的，我可以，不要再敲了！
-Hello! Can you hear me? -Yes, I can! Stop that banging!

297
00:18:21,238 --> 00:18:23,900
博士，这东西使用时
If I may, Doctor, this works so much better...

298
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,067
可以工作的更好
when it's right-way up and plugged in.

299
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:28,236
-哦！ -你真是太可爱了！
-Ooh! -Lovely. There you go.

300
00:18:28,278 --> 00:18:30,905
您要是不介意， 我想我可以自己来控制
If you don't mind, I can manage my own plugging!

301
00:18:30,946 --> 00:18:32,071
我是阿米莉娅船长
I'm Captain Amelia...

302
00:18:32,113 --> 00:18:33,916
普洛腾舰队的后起之秀
Iate of a few run-ins with the Protean armada.

303
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:36,110
龌龊的买卖， 但我不想因我的创伤烦扰你
Nasty business, but I won't bore you with my scars.

304
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,914
您已经见过我的助手了 ——埃柔先生
You've met my first officer, Mr. Arrow.

305
00:18:37,952 --> 00:18:40,045
淳朴，强壮，可靠， 诚实，勇猛，忠实
Sterling, tough, dependable, honest, brave, and true.

306
00:18:40,088 --> 00:18:41,712
行了，船长
Please, Captain.

307
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:43,721
哦，闭嘴，埃柔！ 我是说你一样都不是
Oh, shut up, Arrow. You know I don't mean a word of it.

308
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:47,122
啊哈，打扰一下。 我不喜欢打断人家！
Ahem, excuse me. I hate to interrupt. It's not much better.

309
00:18:47,158 --> 00:18:49,626
但是，我可以跟你们介绍， 吉姆·霍金斯
but may I introduce to you, Jim Hawkins?

310
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,959
吉姆，你们知道， 就是找到那些珍宝的男孩
Jim, you see, is the boy who found the treasure--

311
00:18:52,997 --> 00:18:55,157
博士，够了！
Doctor, please!

312
00:18:57,768 --> 00:19:00,234
到我船舱来， 我跟你谈谈
I'd like a word with you in my stateroom.

313
00:19:01,469 --> 00:19:06,930
博士，在这些多嘴的人面前
Doctor, to muse and blabber about the treasure now

314
00:19:06,974 --> 00:19:08,943
说这些关于财宝的事情
in front of this particular crew...

315
00:19:08,976 --> 00:19:11,205
只能说明
demonstrates a level of ineptitude...

316
00:19:11,244 --> 00:19:13,403
你简直就是一个低能儿
that borders on the imbecilic...

317
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:15,437
这么说，我已经是很人道了
and I mean that in a very caring way.

318
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:18,938
低能？你这么说我？ 愚蠢，我..
Imbecilic, did you say? Foolishness, I've--

319
00:19:18,984 --> 00:19:20,609
我可以看看地图吗？
May I see the map, please?

320
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,449
看吧
Here.

321
00:19:29,058 --> 00:19:31,491
呣，太好了
Hmm. Fascinating.

322
00:19:33,195 --> 00:19:35,162
霍金斯先生，以后
Mr. Hawkins, in the future...

323
00:19:35,196 --> 00:19:37,096
你可以叫我“船长”或者是“先生”
you will address me as "Captain" or "Ma'am."

324
00:19:37,132 --> 00:19:38,258
明白了吗？
Is that clear?

325
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:40,768
啊
Ugh...

326
00:19:40,802 --> 00:19:42,097
霍金斯先生？
Mr. Hawkins?

327
00:19:43,137 --> 00:19:46,104
-知道了，先生
-Yes, ma'am.

328
00:19:46,139 --> 00:19:49,097
先生们，这东西不用的时候， 我们必须把它锁起来
Gentlemen, this must be kept under lock and key...

329
00:19:49,097 --> 00:19:52,970
博士，我用我最诚挚的敬意 再说一遍
when not in use. And, Doctor, again...with the greatest possible respect...

330
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:55,034
不要再大声嚷嚷！
zip your howling screamer.

331
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:56,740
船长，我保证
Captain, I assure you l--

332
00:19:56,782 --> 00:20:00,272
我简短的说一下
Let me make this as monosyllabic as possible.

333
00:20:00,316 --> 00:20:04,616
我不在乎你雇用的这些水手
I don't much care for this crew you hired.

334
00:20:04,654 --> 00:20:07,054
他们...埃柔， 你说我要怎么形容这些人？
They're...how did l describe them, Arrow?

335
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:09,420
早茶之前我说得很清楚了
I said something rather good this morning before coffee.

336
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:13,757
“一帮滑稽可笑的留着口水的傻子！”先生
"A ludicrous parcel of driveling galoots," ma'am.

337
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:17,320
-就是这样！太有诗意了！ -现在，看着我
-There you go--poetry. -Now, see here--

338
00:20:17,363 --> 00:20:21,526
博士，我想和所有的船员聊天
Doctor, I'd love to chat to the whole ship crew.

339
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:22,897
但是，我得负责这艘船的航行
but I have a ship to launch...

340
00:20:22,934 --> 00:20:25,036
你也擦亮了你的装备
and you've got your outfit to buff up.

341
00:20:25,035 --> 00:20:27,366
埃柔先生，请你把这两个新人
Mr. Arrow, please escort these two neophytes...

342
00:20:27,404 --> 00:20:28,928
带下去
down to the galley straightaway.

343
00:20:28,973 --> 00:20:31,702
年轻的霍金斯就跟着 我们的厨师席尔瓦先生
Young Hawkins will be working for our cook, Mr. Silver.

344
00:20:31,742 --> 00:20:34,175
什么？厨师？
What? The cook?

345
00:20:35,547 --> 00:20:38,016
死女人，属猫的！
That woman! That...feline!

346
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,245
她搞清楚谁才是头儿了没有？
Who does she think is working for whom?

347
00:20:40,286 --> 00:20:42,616
那是我的地图， 她是拿我的工钱的！
It's my map, and she's got me bussin' tables?

348
00:20:42,653 --> 00:20:45,383
不许你们说我船长的坏话！
I'll not tolerate a cross word about our captain!

349
00:20:45,422 --> 00:20:49,755
再也找不到比她更好的长官了！
There's no finer officer in this or any galaxy.

350
00:20:52,728 --> 00:20:54,855
席尔瓦先生？
Mr. Silver?

351
00:20:54,897 --> 00:20:57,127
怎么了？埃柔先生？
Why, Mr. Arrow, sir.

352
00:20:57,165 --> 00:20:59,564
您的到来
Bringin' in such fine and distinguished gents...

353
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,567
使这里蓬荜生辉
to grace my humble galley.

354
00:21:01,602 --> 00:21:04,070
您有何指示？
Had I known,

355
00:21:04,105 --> 00:21:05,535
呵呵呵呵
Heh heh heh heh!

356
00:21:08,607 --> 00:21:10,574
机器人！
A cyborg!

357
00:21:10,609 --> 00:21:12,839
这是多普勒博士！
May I introduce Dr. Doppler?

358
00:21:12,876 --> 00:21:15,276
我们此次航行的投资者
The financier of our voyage.

359
00:21:15,313 --> 00:21:17,439
博士，您装备很可爱
Lovely outfit, Doc.

360
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,008
哦，谢谢！ 您的眼睛也很不错！
Well, thank you. Um, lovely eye.

361
00:21:21,051 --> 00:21:23,780
这个小家伙是吉姆·霍金斯
Uh, this young lad is Jim Hawkins.

362
00:21:24,885 --> 00:21:26,978
吉姆！哦...
Jimbo! Uh...

363
00:21:31,158 --> 00:21:35,787
啊，不要被这大家伙吓着了
Aw, now, don't be too put off by this hunk of hardware.

364
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:43,792
哇！
Whoa!

365
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:46,098
这装置可以用来...
These gears have been tough getting used to...

366
00:21:46,137 --> 00:21:49,903
但是他们的确很方便
but they do come in mighty handy from time to time.

367
00:21:57,947 --> 00:21:59,674
呣！
Mmm!

368
00:21:59,713 --> 00:22:04,810
好了，来，尝尝！
Here, now, have a taste

369
00:22:07,721 --> 00:22:07,920
呣！我喜欢这味道， 浓烈的味道
Mmm! Delightfully tangy, yet robust.

370
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,547
呣！我喜欢这味道， 浓烈的味道
Mmm! Delightfully tangy, yet robust.

371
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,150
祖传秘方！
Old family recipe.

372
00:22:14,192 --> 00:22:15,283
啊！
Aah!

373
00:22:15,326 --> 00:22:18,954
实际上，那是祖传秘方中的一部分！
In fact, that was part of the old family!

374
00:22:18,996 --> 00:22:21,965
哈哈哈哈！
Ha ha ha!

375
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:25,024
欧欧欧！博士，我只是开个玩笑！
Oh, ho! I'm just kiddin', Doc!

376
00:22:25,068 --> 00:22:26,398
哦，是的，没事
Uh, yeah, well...

377
00:22:26,435 --> 00:22:28,960
我要不开玩笑， 那不就是我了
I'm nothin' if I ain't a kidder.

378
00:22:29,004 --> 00:22:31,495
喝吧，吉姆！
Go on, Jimbo. Have a swig.

379
00:22:39,012 --> 00:22:40,172
墨菲！
Morph!

380
00:22:40,213 --> 00:22:43,476
你这个淘气的水滴！
You jiggle-headed blob of mischief!

381
00:22:43,515 --> 00:22:46,007
你刚才藏哪儿去了？
So that's where you was hiding!

382
00:22:50,722 --> 00:22:53,517
哇！哈！ 这是什么？
Wha--? Ha! What is that thing?

383
00:22:53,555 --> 00:22:54,888
“这是什么？”
"What is that thing?"

384
00:22:54,925 --> 00:22:56,722
他是个变种！
He's a morph.

385
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,728
我在变体1中装了形状转换装备
I rescued the little shape-shifter on Proteus 1.

386
00:23:01,328 --> 00:23:03,889
啊哈，他看上我了
Aw, he took a shine to me.

387
00:23:03,933 --> 00:23:06,695
我们一直在一起
We been together ever since.

388
00:23:06,734 --> 00:23:09,566
好极了，啊，乖孩子
Right? Yeah. Nice boy.

389
00:23:09,602 --> 00:23:11,001
走吧，我们下去吧
We're about to get underway.

390
00:23:11,037 --> 00:23:13,163
博士，您要不要参观一下这艘飞船？
Would you like to observe the launch, doctor?

391
00:23:13,205 --> 00:23:14,434
我可以吗？
Would l?

392
00:23:14,473 --> 00:23:18,134
现在的星系核有超光速飞机吗？
Does an active galactic nucleus have superluminal jets?

393
00:23:18,176 --> 00:23:20,541
你带路！
I'll follow you.

394
00:23:20,578 --> 00:23:24,376
席尔瓦先生， 霍金斯先生留在这里听你的指示！
Mr. Hawkins will stay here in your charge, Mr. Silver.

395
00:23:25,582 --> 00:23:27,881
先生，您能再说一遍吗？
Beggin' your pardon, sir, but--

396
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,820
这是船长的命令， 别让这个新来的服务生闲着！
Captain's orders! See to it the new cabin boy's kept busy.

397
00:23:32,855 --> 00:23:35,618
-啊，但是不行...
-Aw, but, no, but--

398
00:23:40,094 --> 00:23:44,052
这样，船长让你和我在一起？
So, Captain's put you with me, eh?

399
00:23:44,096 --> 00:23:45,962
不管怎么样
Whatever.

400
00:23:45,997 --> 00:23:51,400
我一个低贱的机器人 是不能和船长争论的
Well, who be a humble cyborg to argue with a captain?

401
00:23:51,436 --> 00:23:53,734
是的
Yeah.

402
00:23:53,771 --> 00:23:56,763
你知道的，这些小狗
You know...these purps...

403
00:23:56,807 --> 00:24:01,072
他们就像是 从蒙特里莎回来的一样
they're kind of like the ones back home on Montressor.

404
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:02,703
你去过那儿？
You ever been there?

405
00:24:02,746 --> 00:24:05,406
吉姆，不能说是我去过
I can't say as I have, Jimbo.

406
00:24:06,982 --> 00:24:09,643
仔细想想
Come to think of it,

407
00:24:09,684 --> 00:24:11,709
我碰到这个老家伙
I met this old guy, who was, um...

408
00:24:11,753 --> 00:24:15,118
他在找他的机器人伙伴
he was kind of looking for a cyborg buddy of his.

409
00:24:15,155 --> 00:24:16,452
是吗？
Is that so?

410
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:17,819
是的
Yeah.

411
00:24:17,857 --> 00:24:21,690
那人叫什么名字？
What was that old salamander's name?

412
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:24,217
哦，哦，鲍恩斯
Oh, yeah. Bones.

413
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:26,196
比利·鲍恩斯？
Billy Bones?

414
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:29,323
鲍恩斯？鲍恩斯？
Bones? Bones?!

415
00:24:29,366 --> 00:24:31,663
呣，他有摇铃吗？
Mm-mmm. T'ain't ringin' any bells.

416
00:24:31,701 --> 00:24:33,965
一定是另外一个机器人！
Must have been a different cyborg.

417
00:24:34,003 --> 00:24:37,267
在这艘船上还有许多机器人
There's a slew of cyborgs roamin' this port.

418
00:24:38,506 --> 00:24:40,236
准备起飞！
Prepare to cast off!

419
00:24:40,276 --> 00:24:44,210
哦，去吧，小伙子， 去看看起飞吧
Eh, off with you, lad, and watch the launch.

420
00:24:44,244 --> 00:24:48,180
还有许多工作等着你做呢
There'll be plenty work a-waitin' for you afterwards.

421
00:24:52,485 --> 00:24:58,786
我们最好盯着这个男孩， 是不是，墨菲？
We best be keepin' a sharp eye on this one, eh, Morph?

422
00:24:58,822 --> 00:25:03,726
我们不能让他多管闲事！
We wouldn't want him strayin' into things he shouldn't.

423
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:06,960
船长，我们都准备好了
We're all clear, Captain!

424
00:25:07,002 --> 00:25:10,334
哦，朋友， 我们是不是可以让这破船起飞了？
Well, my friend. Are we ready to raise this creaking tub?

425
00:25:10,372 --> 00:25:12,463
船长，荣幸之至！
My pleasure, Captain.

426
00:25:12,506 --> 00:25:15,497
各就各位！
All hands to stations!

427
00:25:16,743 --> 00:25:17,868
快点！
Smartly now!

428
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,468
快点，你这个渣仔！ 我要追上你！
Come on, you scurvy scum! I'll race you!

429
00:25:23,248 --> 00:25:26,478
打开所有太阳能帆！
Loose all solar sails!

430
00:25:31,587 --> 00:25:32,747
快！
Come on!

431
00:25:37,626 --> 00:25:40,686
把帆拉紧！
Heave up the braces.

432
00:25:40,729 --> 00:25:42,525
拉紧！
Brace up.

433
00:25:56,942 --> 00:25:58,636
哦，哦！
Ooh. Oh.

434
00:25:58,676 --> 00:26:01,576
佐夫先生，加强船的吸引力
Mr. Zoff, engage the dropt

435
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:12,449
腾巴克先生，南偏西， 转向：2－1－0－0
South by southwest, Mr. Turnbuckle, heading 2-1-0-0.

436
00:26:12,486 --> 00:26:15,354
是，船长。2－1－0－0
Aye, Captain. 2-1-0-0.

437
00:26:17,724 --> 00:26:19,918
全速前进。埃柔先生！
Full speed, Mr. Arrow, if you please.

438
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,257
全速前进！
Take her away!

439
00:26:25,231 --> 00:26:27,357
博士，您能不能坚强一点？
Brace yourself, Doctor.

440
00:26:27,398 --> 00:26:29,365
“您能不能坚强一点？”
"Brace yourself."

441
00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:31,391
啊！哦！
Aah! Oof!

442
00:26:50,617 --> 00:26:51,744
哇！
Whoa.

443
00:27:08,365 --> 00:27:12,596
难以置信 这就是冥界的银河？
Upon my word, an Orcus Galacticus.

444
00:27:14,302 --> 00:27:15,599
笑一个
Smile.

445
00:27:15,637 --> 00:27:17,195
哦，博士，你最好站远点
Uh, Doctor, I'd stand clear--

446
00:27:20,508 --> 00:27:22,032
哈
Ha.

447
00:27:22,076 --> 00:27:25,101
啊，船长 真是航运史上一个伟大的日子
Ah. 'tis a grand day for sailing. Captain...

448
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,577
看看您
and look at you.

449
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:29,239
您衣冠楚楚，就像
You're as trim and as bonny as a sloop...

450
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:32,078
一艘上了新帆， 涂了新漆的帆船
with new sails and a fresh coat of paint.

451
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:33,948
席尔瓦先生， 你可以把你的这些恭维
You can keep that kind of flim-flammery...

452
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,850
送给那些在空间站的妓女
for your spaceport floozies, Silver.

453
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:37,353
飞船基地的妓女 飞船基地的妓女
Spaceport floozy, spaceport floozy--

454
00:27:37,388 --> 00:27:39,789
船长，你也太打击我了
You cut me to the quick, Captain.

455
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,758
我一直有什么说什么
I speaks nothing but me heart at all times.

456
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:44,019
自是肺腑之言
Nothing but me heart.

457
00:27:44,058 --> 00:27:46,856
对了，那是你的帮手吗？
And, by the way, isn't that your cabin boy...

458
00:27:46,896 --> 00:27:50,591
在桅杆上闲逛的？
aimlessly footling about in those shrouds?

459
00:27:50,631 --> 00:27:52,258
是的，他...哦
Yep, it--oh...

460
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:57,327
只是一时的失误，船长！ 马上就会恢复正常！吉姆！
A momentary aberration, Cap'n, soon to be addressed. Jimbo!

461
00:27:58,804 --> 00:28:01,600
我新交了两个朋友， 我想你见见他们
I got two new friends I'd like you to meet.

462
00:28:03,042 --> 00:28:07,943
跟拖把先生和水桶小姐问好吧
Say hello to Mr. Mop and Mrs. Bucket.

463
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,912
呵呵呵呵！
Heh heh heh heh!

464
00:28:09,947 --> 00:28:11,277
好啊
Yippee.

465
00:28:13,217 --> 00:28:15,047
好了，我认识拖把先生了
Yeah, I got your Mr. Mop.

466
00:28:18,253 --> 00:28:21,050
小心点，笨蛋
Watch it, twerp.

467
00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:37,561
看什么看，怪物！
What are you looking at, weirdo?

468
00:28:38,836 --> 00:28:40,995
就是，怪物
Yeah, weirdo.

469
00:28:44,508 --> 00:28:51,138
服务生要学会 专心干自己的事！
Cabin boys should learn to mind their own business.

470
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:53,670
为什么？你把什么东西藏起来了？ 亮眼睛的家伙？
Why? You got something to hide, bright eyes?

471
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:59,947
看来你的耳朵有问题
Maybe your ears don't work so well.

472
00:28:59,986 --> 00:29:01,955
是的，啊
Yeah. Ahem.

473
00:29:01,988 --> 00:29:04,014
坏透了， 但是我的鼻子却很正常
Too bad my nose works just fine.

474
00:29:04,058 --> 00:29:08,048
什么！你这个没有家教的家伙！
Why, you impudent little--

475
00:29:10,062 --> 00:29:11,824
继续，把他剁了！
Go ahead! Slice him! Dice him!

476
00:29:13,731 --> 00:29:17,825
你再说一遍？服务生！
Any last words, cabin boy?

477
00:29:20,169 --> 00:29:21,534
斯科洛先生
Mr. Scroop...

478
00:29:24,204 --> 00:29:27,037
你知道
you ever see what happens to a fresh purp...

479
00:29:27,075 --> 00:29:30,942
狗被用力掐的下场吗？
when you squeeze real hard?

480
00:29:33,145 --> 00:29:34,611
出什么事了！
What's all this. then?

481
00:29:38,117 --> 00:29:39,948
你们知道规矩的
You know the rules.

482
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:42,612
船上不许大声喧哗
There'll be no brawling on this ship.

483
00:29:42,654 --> 00:29:43,847
是的，是的，先生
Aye, aye, sir.

484
00:29:43,887 --> 00:29:47,583
以后谁要再犯，
Any further offenders will be confined to the brig...

485
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:50,387
就只能呆在狭窄的双桅船里了
for the remainder of the voyage.

486
00:29:50,425 --> 00:29:54,054
斯科洛先生， 我说得够明白吗？
Am I clear, Mr. Scroop?

487
00:29:59,767 --> 00:30:02,201
知道了
Transparently.

488
00:30:07,673 --> 00:30:10,469
做的好，埃柔先生！
Well done, Mr. Arrow, sir!

489
00:30:10,507 --> 00:30:13,375
一艘团结的船， 一艘令人愉快的船！
A tight ship's a happy ship, sir.

490
00:30:14,544 --> 00:30:17,273
吉姆，给你个活干！
Jimbo, I gave you a job.

491
00:30:17,314 --> 00:30:19,715
嘿，之前我一直在做！
Hey, I was doing it until that bug thing--

492
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:24,912
闭嘴， 现在我要你把甲板拖的干干净净
Belay that! Now, I want this deck swabbed spotless...

493
00:30:24,953 --> 00:30:28,513
我回来之前还没做好， 你就祈求上帝保佑吧
and heaven help you if I come back and it's not done.

494
00:30:28,555 --> 00:30:32,253
墨菲， 看着这小子
Morph? Keep an eye on this pup...

495
00:30:32,293 --> 00:30:34,920
随时留意着他有没有分心
and let me know if there be any more distractions.

496
00:30:34,962 --> 00:30:36,120
是，遵命！
OK. Aye-aye.

497
00:30:45,233 --> 00:30:47,563
好了，大家都到齐了
So, we're all here, then.

498
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,832
-来了 -很好
-Excuse me. -Fine.

499
00:30:52,204 --> 00:30:57,335
先生们，请原谅我的坦率
Now, if you pardon my plain speaking, gentlemen...

500
00:30:57,376 --> 00:30:59,036
你们都是
are you all...

501
00:30:59,078 --> 00:31:02,775
笨蛋， 彻彻底底的蠢货吗！？
stark-raving, totally blinking daft?!

502
00:31:04,082 --> 00:31:06,344
我好不容易让大家
After all me finagling getting us hired...

503
00:31:06,382 --> 00:31:08,009
以水手的身份上船
as an upstanding crew...

504
00:31:08,051 --> 00:31:11,816
你们想让计划全部败露吗？
you want to blow the whole mutiny before it's time?

505
00:31:11,854 --> 00:31:14,822
那男孩已经有所察觉了！
The boy was sniffing about.

506
00:31:14,857 --> 00:31:20,452
是你差点让计划失败的，笨蛋！
You just stick to the plan, you bug-brained twit.

507
00:31:20,494 --> 00:31:24,190
至于那个小孩， 我会给他一堆的活儿
As for the boy, I'll run him so ragged...

508
00:31:24,229 --> 00:31:26,288
让他没有时间去想
he won't have time to think.

509
00:31:36,873 --> 00:31:39,501
这真是有趣的一天
Well, this has been a fun day

510
00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:44,000
交了新朋友，像那个蜘蛛
Making new friends like that spider psycho.

511
00:31:44,045 --> 00:31:45,979
蜘蛛，蜘蛛
Spider psycho, spider psycho.

512
00:31:46,014 --> 00:31:47,844
呵呵，有点丑
Heh. A little uglier.

513
00:31:47,882 --> 00:31:50,315
哈哈哈哈
Mwah-ha-ha-ha!

514
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,579
闭上嘴吧
Pretty close.

515
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,879
哦
Well...

516
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:55,910
这真要感谢上帝了
thank heavens for little miracles.

517
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,547
上来一个小时了
Up here for an hour...

518
00:31:57,591 --> 00:31:59,888
甲板还是老样子
and the deck's still in one piece.

519
00:31:59,925 --> 00:32:02,893
嗯，你知道，哦
Um, look, l, uh...

520
00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:06,328
你所做的
What you did...

521
00:32:08,601 --> 00:32:10,032
谢谢
Thanks.

522
00:32:11,934 --> 00:32:13,868
难道没人教你
Didn't your pap ever teach you...

523
00:32:13,903 --> 00:32:16,199
要好好控制自己的情绪吗？
to pick your fights a bit more carefully?

524
00:32:21,442 --> 00:32:24,001
你父亲没有教你？
Your father's not the teachin' sort.

525
00:32:24,044 --> 00:32:25,841
没有！
No.

526
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:30,009
他离家出走了， 再也没回来！
He was more the taking off and never coming back sort.

527
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:31,879
哦！
Oh.

528
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,217
对不起，小伙子
Sorry, lad.

529
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:39,851
嘿，没事 我很好
Hey, no big deal. I'm doing just fine.

530
00:32:39,892 --> 00:32:43,518
真的？
Is that so?

531
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:47,221
既然船长把你安排在我这里
Well, since the captain has put you in my charge...

532
00:32:47,263 --> 00:32:49,423
不管我喜不喜欢你
Iike it or not,

533
00:32:49,464 --> 00:32:51,865
都不能让你惹上麻烦
into that thick head of yours to keep you out of trouble.

534
00:32:51,901 --> 00:32:53,229
-什么？ -从现在起
-What? -From now on...

535
00:32:53,266 --> 00:32:55,529
我会一直盯着你
I'm not letting you out of me sight.

536
00:32:55,568 --> 00:32:56,696
你不能这么做！
You can't do--

537
00:32:56,804 --> 00:32:58,497
你不能想吃就吃 想睡就睡
You won't so much as eat, sleep...

538
00:32:58,539 --> 00:33:01,633
没我同意的话， 你什么都不许做
or scratch your bum without my say-so.

539
00:33:01,675 --> 00:33:03,140
你别在这儿给我出馊主意！
Don't do me any favors!

540
00:33:03,176 --> 00:33:05,974
哦，小伙子， 你要相信我！
Oh, you can be sure of that, my lad.

541
00:33:06,011 --> 00:33:06,067
相信我！
You can be sure of that.

542
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,364
相信我！
You can be sure of that.

543
00:33:08,402 --> 00:33:09,960
哈哈哈哈！
Heh heh heh heh!

544
00:33:14,073 --> 00:33:16,563
用点力气
Put some elbow into it.

545
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:31,651
（歌词） 爱通往神秘的地方
I am a question to the world

546
00:33:31,687 --> 00:33:34,918
我不清楚的方向
Not an answer to be heard

547
00:33:34,957 --> 00:33:40,087
跌跌撞撞，会不会鲁莽
Or a moment that's held in your arms

548
00:33:40,128 --> 00:33:44,690
星光照亮苍白的天堂
And what do you think you'd ever say

549
00:33:44,732 --> 00:33:47,927
燃烧胆怯的魔杖
I won't listen anyway

550
00:33:47,967 --> 00:33:49,664
一股力量
You don't know me

551
00:33:49,702 --> 00:33:52,497
在推着我体会冒险
And I'll never be what you want

552
00:33:52,536 --> 00:33:54,937
的真相
Made of pain

553
00:33:59,542 --> 00:34:04,103
勇敢口袋唯一的行囊
And what do you think you'd understand?

554
00:34:04,147 --> 00:34:07,377
对抗没落的权杖
I'm a boy. no. I'm a man

555
00:34:07,415 --> 00:34:12,317
面对风暴绝对不投降
You can take me and throw me away

556
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:17,152
飞翔迎着空气的冰凉
And how can you learn what's never shown

557
00:34:17,189 --> 00:34:20,250
心却越烧越滚烫
Yeah. you stand here on your own

558
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:21,952
这趟旅程不会一样
They don't know me

559
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:27,328
宝藏葬在风暴的港湾
'Cause I'm not here

560
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:31,322
我在怀疑，我在想
And I want a moment to be real

561
00:34:31,367 --> 00:34:34,962
不够坚强，别和他较量
Want to touch things I don 't feel

562
00:34:35,004 --> 00:34:40,030
宝藏，没有清楚的模样
Want to hold on and feel I belong

563
00:34:40,075 --> 00:34:44,637
没有真实的重量
And how can the world want me to change

564
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:47,771
依然发现终生难忘
They're the ones that stay the same

565
00:34:47,815 --> 00:34:49,908
伙伴还有几个在身旁
They don 't know me

566
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:54,385
同样坚持和倔强
But I'm still here

567
00:34:54,419 --> 00:34:59,321
不曾遗忘当初的信仰
And you see the things they never see

568
00:34:59,357 --> 00:35:02,519
尽管路途遥远而漫长
All you wanted. I could be

569
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,185
充满未知和虚幻
Now you know me

570
00:35:04,226 --> 00:35:07,059
只要记得
And I'm not afraid

571
00:35:07,097 --> 00:35:12,159
你至诚的我在手上
And I want to tell you who I am

572
00:35:12,201 --> 00:35:15,363
宝藏葬在风暴的港湾
Can you help me be a man?

573
00:35:15,403 --> 00:35:16,993
我在怀疑，我在想
They can 't break me

574
00:35:17,036 --> 00:35:21,369
不够坚强，别和他较量
As long as I know who I am

575
00:35:23,609 --> 00:35:27,010
宝藏，没有清楚的模样
They can 't tell me who to be

576
00:35:30,247 --> 00:35:34,808
没有真实的重量
'Cause I'm not what they see

577
00:35:34,852 --> 00:35:36,843
依然发现终生难忘
Yeah. the world is still sleeping

578
00:35:36,886 --> 00:35:39,689
手里紧握藏宝图
While I keep on dreaming for me

579
00:35:39,689 --> 00:35:41,553
背诵你的祝福
While I keep on dreaming for me

580
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,956
城市一点点一点点
And the words are just whispers and lies

581
00:35:43,992 --> 00:35:49,623
慢慢消失
That I'll never believe

582
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:56,098
勇气渐渐的渐渐的
And I want a moment to be real

583
00:35:56,137 --> 00:35:59,195
写成故事
Want to touch things I don 't feel

584
00:35:59,238 --> 00:36:02,935
宝藏葬在风暴的港湾
Want to hold on and feel I belong

585
00:36:02,973 --> 00:36:04,270
哇！
Whoa!

586
00:36:04,307 --> 00:36:08,972
我在怀疑我在想
How can you say I never change?

587
00:36:09,012 --> 00:36:11,878
不够坚强别和他较量
They're the ones that stay the same

588
00:36:11,913 --> 00:36:13,938
宝藏没有清楚的模样
I'm the one now

589
00:36:13,982 --> 00:36:18,749
没有真实的重量
'Cause I'm still here

590
00:36:18,787 --> 00:36:24,019
依然拥有终生难忘
I'm the one son still here

591
00:36:24,058 --> 00:36:27,390
那宝藏是成长
I'm still here

592
00:36:27,427 --> 00:36:31,418
是成长，是成长，在成长
I'm still here

593
00:36:47,673 --> 00:36:48,799
哦，哦，哦！
Oh, ho ho!

594
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:50,169
你有麻烦了？
You having a little trouble there?

595
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:51,333
哦，离我远点！
Oh, get away from me.

596
00:36:52,842 --> 00:36:54,606
哦，吉姆
Oh, Jimbo.

597
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:59,013
我在你这年纪的时候要是会开船
If I could maneuver a skiff like that when I was your age...

598
00:36:59,048 --> 00:37:02,175
那今天走街上， 他们都会向我鞠躬
they'd be bowing in the streets when I walked by today.

599
00:37:02,216 --> 00:37:03,343
在街上鞠躬
Bowing in the streets.

600
00:37:03,386 --> 00:37:04,784
-噢。 -噢。
-Oof. -Oof.

601
00:37:04,819 --> 00:37:06,685
我不知道
I don't know.

602
00:37:06,721 --> 00:37:10,781
我离开家的时候 他们并没有对我表示赞扬。
They weren't exactly singing my praises when I left home.

603
00:37:10,824 --> 00:37:13,224
-呵。喔。 -喔。
-Heh. Whew. -Whew.

604
00:37:14,594 --> 00:37:16,388
但是我要改变这一切
But I'm gonna change all that.

605
00:37:16,428 --> 00:37:19,487
现在？怎么改变？
Are you now? How so?

606
00:37:19,531 --> 00:37:23,193
哦，我有计划。
Uh, I got some plans.

607
00:37:23,233 --> 00:37:26,326
让他们对我刮目相看
Gonna make people see me a little different.

608
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:29,394
哦
Ooh.

609
00:37:29,438 --> 00:37:32,999
有时，人算不如天算
Sometimes, plans go astray.

610
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,407
这一次不会
Not this time.

611
00:37:35,443 --> 00:37:36,968
呣
Hmm.

612
00:37:41,447 --> 00:37:42,916
哦
Ooh...

613
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:47,340
欧，谢谢，墨菲
Oh, thank you, Morphy.

614
00:37:49,588 --> 00:37:53,023
哦，为什么
So, uh, how that happened anyway

615
00:37:55,961 --> 00:38:01,261
你放弃了许多事情， 来实现一个梦想
You give up a few things chasing a dream.

616
00:38:01,297 --> 00:38:03,424
值吗？
Was it worth it?

617
00:38:04,499 --> 00:38:06,161
呵
Heh.

618
00:38:09,337 --> 00:38:11,237
我希望如此，吉姆
I'm hoping it is, Jimbo.

619
00:38:11,271 --> 00:38:13,761
我一直坚信
I most surely am.

620
00:38:20,546 --> 00:38:22,604
怎么回事？
What the devil?

621
00:38:22,647 --> 00:38:24,307
我的天
Good heavens.

622
00:38:24,349 --> 00:38:26,782
是流星雨
The star Pelusa...

623
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,942
是超新星
it's gone supernova!

624
00:38:28,985 --> 00:38:31,215
紧急回避，腾巴克先生
Evasive action, Mr. Turnbuckle!

625
00:38:31,254 --> 00:38:32,448
是 ，船长
Aye-aye, Captain.

626
00:38:35,258 --> 00:38:38,693
所有人，把自己的救生索绑好了 各就各位
All hands,

627
00:38:52,104 --> 00:38:55,470
埃柔先生，收帆
Mr. Arrow, secure those sails!

628
00:38:55,506 --> 00:38:57,906
收帆
Secure all sails!

629
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:00,568
伙计们，把它们都收下来
Reef them down. men!

630
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:14,418
吔，宝贝！击中了！ 哈哈哈哈！
Yeah, baby! Ba-boom! Ha ha ha ha!

631
00:39:19,592 --> 00:39:21,718
-啊！ -席尔瓦！
-Aah! -Silver!

632
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:28,595
哇！谢谢！伙计！
Whoa. Thanks, lad.

633
00:39:50,283 --> 00:39:54,480
船长，那颗星...
Captain, the star!

634
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,680
它飞向了一个...
It's devolving into a...

635
00:39:56,722 --> 00:40:00,657
一个黑——洞！
a black hole!

636
00:40:00,692 --> 00:40:03,752
我们就要被拉进去了！ 哦！
We're being pulled in! Ohh!

637
00:40:03,793 --> 00:40:05,488
不，不行！
No, you don't, you--

638
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:16,533
这见鬼的波浪！ 他们太奇怪了！
Blast these waves! They're so deucedly erratic!

639
00:40:16,571 --> 00:40:18,801
不，船长。 他们是有规律的！
No, Captain. They're not erratic at all.

640
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:22,171
四秒钟之后还有一波！
There'll be one more in precisely 4  seconds.

641
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:24,871
后面还有一个更大的
Followed by the biggest magilla of them all!

642
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:26,969
当然，聪明的博士！
Of course! Brilliant, Doctor!

643
00:40:27,012 --> 00:40:29,844
我们可以借助最后一波的冲力 离开这里
We'll ride that last magilla out of here.

644
00:40:29,882 --> 00:40:32,315
船长，帆都收好了！
All sails secured, Captain!

645
00:40:32,351 --> 00:40:35,877
好样的！ 现在把它们全部打开！
Good man! Now release them immediately!

646
00:40:37,355 --> 00:40:40,150
遵命，船长！ 你们都听到了，伙计们！
Aye, Captain. You heard her, men.

647
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:42,315
把帆全部展开
Unfurl those sails.

648
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:43,917
-什么？！ -我们刚刚收起来！
-What?! -But we just finished...

649
00:40:43,961 --> 00:40:47,487
-坚持住！ -一定要坚持住！
-Tying them down! -Make up your blooming minds!

650
00:40:49,396 --> 00:40:50,863
霍金斯先生！
Mr. Hawkins...

651
00:40:50,898 --> 00:40:54,857
确定所有救生索的结都打紧了！
make sure all lifelines are secured good and tight!

652
00:40:54,901 --> 00:40:56,369
遵命，船长
Aye-aye, Captain.

653
00:41:03,608 --> 00:41:05,543
很结实，船长！
Lifelines secured, Captain!

654
00:41:05,577 --> 00:41:06,735
好极了！
Very good!

655
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:12,977
哇！啊——！
Gaah! Whoa!

656
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:15,710
喔！
Oof!

657
00:41:24,423 --> 00:41:26,448
啊！
Aah!

658
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,899
船长，最后一波了！
Captain. the last wave!

659
00:41:35,934 --> 00:41:37,925
它来了！
Here it comes!

660
00:41:37,968 --> 00:41:40,027
先生们，抓紧你们的救生索！
Hold on to your lifelines, gents!

661
00:41:40,069 --> 00:41:42,435
下面的航行会很颠簸！
It's gonna be a bumpy ride!

662
00:42:00,553 --> 00:42:01,485
喔！
Oof!

663
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:24,933
船长！哦，我的天。那是..
Captain! That--oh, my goodness. That was--

664
00:42:24,969 --> 00:42:26,526
那真是.. 那是最...
that was absolutely-- that was the most--

665
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:28,934
哦
Oh, tish-tosh.

666
00:42:28,971 --> 00:42:31,805
你天文学的建议功劳最大了
your astronomical advice was most helpful.

667
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:35,503
哦，哦，谢谢。 非常感谢！
Well, uh, uh--thank you. Thank you very much.

668
00:42:35,543 --> 00:42:37,738
哦，我可以在解剖学上提供帮助
Well, I have a lot of help to offer anatomically--

669
00:42:37,779 --> 00:42:41,179
解剖学，解剖学
amanamonically-- as-astronomically.

670
00:42:41,214 --> 00:42:44,047
对了，席尔瓦先生， 我该恭喜你
Well, I must congratulate you, Mr. Silver.

671
00:42:44,084 --> 00:42:45,210
你的服务生男孩
It seems your cabin boy...

672
00:42:45,251 --> 00:42:47,776
在救生索上做了很大贡献啊
did a bang-up job with those lifelines.

673
00:42:49,387 --> 00:42:51,820
所有人都做的很好
All hands accounted for,

674
00:42:54,858 --> 00:42:56,019
埃柔先生？
Mr. Arrow?

675
00:42:58,095 --> 00:43:02,554
我想埃柔先生失踪了
I'm afraid Mr. Arrow has been lost.

676
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,568
他的救生索没有绑紧
His lifeline was not secured.

677
00:43:10,538 --> 00:43:12,164
不可能，我都检查了
No, I checked them all.

678
00:43:15,941 --> 00:43:19,536
我..我的确都检查过了！ 他们都很牢靠！.
I--I did. I checked them all. They were secure.

679
00:43:19,577 --> 00:43:21,306
我发誓！
I swear.

680
00:43:32,388 --> 00:43:35,482
埃柔先生是个...
Mr. Arrow was a...

681
00:43:35,525 --> 00:43:39,722
啊，很好的宇航员
Ahem. Fine spacer...

682
00:43:39,761 --> 00:43:43,697
我们中最好的 是我们的榜样
finer than most of us could ever hope to be...

683
00:43:45,198 --> 00:43:48,325
他知道这有风险
but he knew the risks,

684
00:43:48,367 --> 00:43:51,859
回到你们的岗位上， 我们继续前进
Resume your posts. We carry on.

685
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:18,285
你知道吗？ 那不是你的错！
It weren't your fault, you know?

686
00:44:21,327 --> 00:44:26,026
怎么了，如果不是你 一半的人会被卷进黑洞的
Why, half the crew would be spinning in that black abyss--

687
00:44:26,065 --> 00:44:29,430
你还不明白了吗？ 是我把事情弄糟了
Look, don't you get it?! I screwed up!

688
00:44:29,467 --> 00:44:31,432
只需两秒钟
For two seconds,

689
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:33,832
我本可以把事情做好，但是...
I could do something right, but--

690
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:36,964
啊！我只是...
Aagh! I just--

691
00:44:40,107 --> 00:44:43,133
算了！算了！
Just forget it. Forget it.

692
00:44:49,349 --> 00:44:53,718
现在，听我说， 詹姆斯·霍金斯
Now, you listen to me, James Hawkins.

693
00:44:53,752 --> 00:44:57,187
年轻人，虽然你有本事
You got the makings of greatness in ya...

694
00:44:57,222 --> 00:45:00,555
但你必须为自己的理想掌舵
but you gotta take the helm and chart your own course.

695
00:45:00,593 --> 00:45:04,048
好好努力
Stick to it,

696
00:45:04,094 --> 00:45:06,289
机会来时
and when the time comes you get the chance...

697
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:08,594
你就可以检验自己所做的了
to really test the cut of your sails...

698
00:45:08,632 --> 00:45:14,193
向他们展示你努力的成果 我希望我能看到
and show what you're made of, well, I hope I'm there...

699
00:45:14,236 --> 00:45:18,796
抓住机会，你大有前途
catching some of the light coming off ya that day.

700
00:45:31,048 --> 00:45:33,073
呵呵
There, there.

701
00:45:33,118 --> 00:45:35,915
小伙子，好了，吉姆
Lad, it's all right, Jimbo.

702
00:45:35,952 --> 00:45:38,546
好了
It's all right.

703
00:45:41,957 --> 00:45:44,722
不，吉姆，哦...
Now, Jim, l, um...

704
00:45:44,761 --> 00:45:47,284
我得去值班了
I best be getting about my watch...

705
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:50,387
你得回去睡觉了
and you best be getting some shut-eye.

706
00:46:06,243 --> 00:46:10,234
我深陷其中了，墨菲
Getting in too deep here, Morphy.

707
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:14,478
他们会说我越来越心软了
Next thing ya know, they'll be saying I've gone soft.

708
00:46:43,386 --> 00:46:47,083
哦，欧！哦，欧！
Uh--oh! Oh! Ugh!

709
00:46:54,462 --> 00:46:55,861
墨菲？
Morph?

710
00:47:01,534 --> 00:47:05,060
墨菲，别闹了 天还没亮呢
Morph, knock it off. It's too early for this.

711
00:47:05,103 --> 00:47:06,593
哦！嘿，墨菲！
Ow! Hey, Morph!

712
00:47:10,775 --> 00:47:13,038
-嘿，回来！ -回来！
-Hey, come back here! -Come back here!

713
00:47:16,945 --> 00:47:18,912
抓到你了，墨菲！
Gotcha, Morph!

714
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:24,050
够了，小鱿鱼！
That's it, you little squid.

715
00:47:24,084 --> 00:47:26,052
小鱿鱼！ 小鱿鱼！
You little squid. You little squid.

716
00:47:26,086 --> 00:47:28,076
鱿鱼！鱿鱼！鱿鱼！鱿鱼！
Squid. Squid. Squid. Squid.

717
00:47:31,824 --> 00:47:34,553
哦！哦！
Ungh! Unh!

718
00:47:44,436 --> 00:47:46,733
哈！你完了！
Ha! Busted!

719
00:47:49,539 --> 00:47:52,632
我们要说的是我们等不及了！
Look. what we're saying is we're sick of all this waiting.

720
00:47:52,674 --> 00:47:54,073
他们只剩三个了！
There's only three of them left.

721
00:47:54,108 --> 00:47:56,268
我们就等着行动了
We are wanting to move.

722
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:59,244
在拿到珍宝之前， 我们不能行动
We don't move till we got the treasure in hand.

723
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,476
我是说把他们全杀了
I say we kill 'em all now.

724
00:48:02,515 --> 00:48:06,075
这里我说的算！
I say what's to say!

725
00:48:06,118 --> 00:48:07,779
埃柔先生已经死了
Disobey my orders again...

726
00:48:07,821 --> 00:48:09,879
再违背我的命令
Iike that stunt you pulled with Mr. Arrow...

727
00:48:09,922 --> 00:48:12,991
你的下场就和他一样！
and so help me, you'll be joining him!

728
00:48:12,991 --> 00:48:13,479
你的下场就和他一样！
and so help me, you'll be joining him!

729
00:48:16,025 --> 00:48:21,326
言重了， 我知道
Strong talk, but I know otherwise.

730
00:48:21,362 --> 00:48:23,990
斯科洛，你要说什么？
You got something to say. Scroop?

731
00:48:24,031 --> 00:48:26,900
那个男孩
It's that boy.

732
00:48:28,002 --> 00:48:32,961
我发现你对他很温柔
Methinks you have a soft spot for him.

733
00:48:33,006 --> 00:48:35,165
是啊
Yeah.

734
00:48:35,208 --> 00:48:38,301
现在，看着我，你们
Now, mark me, the lot of ya.

735
00:48:38,343 --> 00:48:42,005
我只关心一件事， 只有一件事！
I care about one thing, and one thing only!

736
00:48:42,046 --> 00:48:44,572
弗林特的宝藏！
Flint's trove.

737
00:48:44,616 --> 00:48:46,674
你们以为我会因为
You think I'd risk it all for the sake...

738
00:48:46,717 --> 00:48:50,310
这个小孩子，放弃吗？
of some nose-wiping little whelp?

739
00:48:50,352 --> 00:48:52,013
那现在怎么办？
What was it now?

740
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:56,956
你在这年轻人身上投入了太多
"Oh. you got the makings of greatness in ya. "

741
00:48:56,991 --> 00:48:58,482
闭嘴！
Shut your yap!

742
00:48:58,527 --> 00:49:03,020
我只是让他惬意， 不至于察觉我们的事情
I cozied up to that kid to keep him off our scent.

743
00:49:03,063 --> 00:49:05,293
我不会心软
But I ain't gone soft.

744
00:49:05,332 --> 00:49:07,321
发现大陆了
Land ho!

745
00:49:13,805 --> 00:49:16,068
哈哈哈，就在那里
Ha ha ha! There it is!

746
00:49:16,106 --> 00:49:18,802
你们到了那里 就可以一饱眼福了
Feast eyes and click heels if you got 'em.

747
00:49:27,149 --> 00:49:29,241
我的望远镜呢？
Where the devil's me glass?

748
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:38,951
吉姆
Jimbo.

749
00:49:42,327 --> 00:49:46,263
我们在捉迷藏？
Playing games, are we?

750
00:49:46,297 --> 00:49:48,288
是的
Yeah.

751
00:49:48,332 --> 00:49:50,392
是的，我们是在捉迷藏
Yeah, we're playing games.

752
00:49:50,434 --> 00:49:57,396
哦，我明白了， 好了，我从不放弃
Oh, I see. Well, I was never

753
00:49:57,439 --> 00:50:01,034
我讨厌失败
Always hated to lose.

754
00:50:01,076 --> 00:50:03,042
呣
Hmm.

755
00:50:03,077 --> 00:50:04,043
我也是！
Me, too!

756
00:50:04,078 --> 00:50:05,603
啊——！
Yaaah!

757
00:50:09,448 --> 00:50:10,609
右边
Right-o...

758
00:50:14,487 --> 00:50:17,512
哦，计划全乱了
Ohh...blast it all.

759
00:50:21,958 --> 00:50:24,586
伙计们，计划有变
Change in plan, lads!

760
00:50:24,628 --> 00:50:26,755
现在马上行动
We move now!

761
00:50:31,265 --> 00:50:34,291
挂上我们的旗帜，奥讷斯先生
Strike our colors, Mr. Onus.

762
00:50:34,335 --> 00:50:36,827
非常高兴，船长先生
With pleasure, Captain.

763
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:51,358
我船上有海盗？ 我要杀光他们！
Pirates on my ship? I'll see they all hang.

764
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:53,827
我船上有海盗？ 我要杀光他们！
Pirates on my ship? I'll see they all hang.

765
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:54,985
博士，会玩这东西吗？
Doctor, familiar with these?

766
00:50:56,197 --> 00:50:57,754
哦，我见过

霍金斯先生，你死都要保住它
Mr. Hawkins! Defend this with your life.

770
00:51:07,539 --> 00:51:09,028
墨菲，把它给我
Morph! Give me that!

771
00:51:12,308 --> 00:51:15,104
哦，你们已经等了很久了

看这边！
Chew on this,

781
00:52:08,753 --> 00:52:11,152
你瞄准了打的？
Did you actually aim for that?

782
00:52:11,187 --> 00:52:12,815

784
00:52:23,165 --> 00:52:25,396
博士，我说“现在”的时候 把前面那缆绳打断
Doctor, when I say "now", shoot out the forward cable.

785
00:52:25,434 --> 00:52:26,560
放心吧，我做得到
I'll take this one.

参数正确 水力学派上用场了
Parameters met. Hydraulics engaged.

800

找到了，来爸爸这吧

801
00:53:16,473 --> 00:53:20,001
不要开炮！ 地图在他们身上！
Hold your fire! We'll lose the map!

802
00:53:21,912 --> 00:53:23,845

00:53:56,071 --> 00:53:58,437
太好玩了， 我都想再来一次
That was more fun than I ever want to have again.

807
00:53:58,473 --> 00:54:04,200
这不是我最成功的着陆！
That's not one of my...gossamer landings. Unh!

808
00:54:04,243 --> 00:54:05,871

只是小伤，没事
Slight bruising. That's all.

813
00:54:13,017 --> 00:54:15,211
来杯茶， 我马上就会好了

墨菲，地图呢？
Morph, where's the map?!

820
00:54:31,533 --> 00:54:34,558
你说真的？！它还在船上？？？
Are you serious?! It's back on the ship?

821
00:54:35,935 --> 00:54:39,393
让那水滴别再吵了
Stifle that blob and get low.

822
00:54:40,975 --> 00:54:43,375
我们的伙伴来了
We've got company.

823
00:54:48,112 --> 00:54:50,808
我们得找个好地方防守
We need a more defensible position.

824
00:54:50,847 --> 00:54:53,008
霍金斯先生，前面探路
Mr. Hawkins, scout ahead.

825
00:54:54,884 --> 00:54:56,011
遵命，船长
Aye, Captain.

826
00:54:56,052 --> 00:54:59,144
-哦！ -小心点，小心点！
-Unh! -Steady, steady.

827
00:54:59,187 --> 00:55:01,781
现在，看看这个
Now, let's have a look at that.

828
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:32,366
嘘——
Shh. shh.

829
00:55:40,172 --> 00:55:42,231
-啊！ -啊！
-Aah! -Aah!

830
00:55:42,274 --> 00:55:43,800
哦，真是太神奇了
Oh, this is fantastic!

831
00:55:43,843 --> 00:55:46,867
终于来了一个 炭组织结构的东西来救我了
A carbon-based life form come to rescue me at last!

832
00:55:46,911 --> 00:55:48,902
我只是想拥抱你
I just want to hug you and squeeze you...

833
00:55:48,946 --> 00:55:50,710
把你抱得紧紧的
and hold you close to me.

834
00:55:50,748 --> 00:55:53,979
好了，你还让不让我走？
All right. OK. Would you just let go of me?

835
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,746
哦，对不起，对不起，对不起！
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

836
00:55:55,786 --> 00:55:59,380
我已经一个人很久了
It's just I've been marooned for so long.

837
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:02,083
我是说，孤独真好
I mean, solitude's fine.

838
00:56:02,123 --> 00:56:03,954
已经几百年了
For hundreds years

839
00:56:03,992 --> 00:56:07,621
你滚远点 哈哈哈
you go a little nuts! Ha ha ha!

840
00:56:07,662 --> 00:56:09,424
对不起，是不是我...
I'm sorry. Am l...

841
00:56:09,461 --> 00:56:10,860
我，嗯...
I am, um...

842
00:56:10,897 --> 00:56:14,527
我叫..
My name is, uh...

843
00:56:18,736 --> 00:56:21,135
本！是了，我叫本
B.E.N.! Of course, I'm B.E.N.

844
00:56:21,171 --> 00:56:23,868
生物电子学航海家
Bioelectronic Navigator. Oops.

845
00:56:23,908 --> 00:56:25,535
-你是？ -吉姆
-And you are? -Jim.

846
00:56:25,576 --> 00:56:27,099
哦，很高兴见到你，吉米
Oh, what a pleasure to meet you, Jimmy.

847
00:56:27,143 --> 00:56:29,374
-是吉姆 -无论如何...
-It's Jim. -Anyway...

848
00:56:29,413 --> 00:56:30,878
你看，我是个...
Look, I'm kind of

849
00:56:30,913 --> 00:56:33,507
我想找个可以藏身的地方， 有海盗在追我
I got to find a place to hide, and there's pirates chasing me.

850
00:56:33,549 --> 00:56:36,745
哦，海盗！ 别让我见到海盗！
Oh, pirates! Don't get me started on pirates!

851
00:56:36,784 --> 00:56:39,844
我不喜欢他们！ 我记得弗林特船长。
I don't like them. I remember Captain Flint.

852
00:56:39,886 --> 00:56:42,150
这家伙火气太大了
This guy had such a temper.

853
00:56:42,188 --> 00:56:44,281
等等，你认识弗林特船长？
Wait, wait, wait. You knew Captain

854
00:56:44,325 --> 00:56:47,258
我想他经常情绪起伏不定
I think he suffered from mood swings, personally.

855
00:56:47,293 --> 00:56:49,056
我不是个医学家
I'm not a therapist, and anyway...

856
00:56:49,094 --> 00:56:51,220
但我..我在散步的时候认识了你
but l--you let me know when I'm rambling.

857
00:56:51,262 --> 00:56:52,592
就是说...
But that means--but wait.

858
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:54,995
你知道财宝的事？
But then you gotta know about the treasure?

859
00:56:55,032 --> 00:56:56,692
-财宝？ -是的，弗林特的宝藏？
-Treasure? -Yeah, Flint's trove?

860
00:56:56,733 --> 00:56:58,700
你知道的， 从几千个世界掠夺来的战利品
You know,

861
00:56:58,735 --> 00:57:00,670
那是，那是...
It's--well, it's...

862
00:57:00,703 --> 00:57:04,229
有那么一点点.. 一点点印象
it's all a little-- little--little fuzzy.

863
00:57:04,272 --> 00:57:07,868
等等，我想起来了
Wait. I--I r-r-remember.

864
00:57:07,909 --> 00:57:09,968
是的，我...财宝
I do. I--treasure!

865
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:12,911
许许多多的财宝埋在
Lots of treasure buried in the centroid--

866
00:57:12,947 --> 00:57:14,971
那些机械装置的核心
centroid--centroid of the mechanism.

867
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:18,278
有一个大门 开开关关
And there was this big door opening and closing...

868
00:57:18,317 --> 00:57:20,342
开开关关
and opening and closing...

869
00:57:20,386 --> 00:57:21,978
弗林特船长要确定
and Captain Flint wanted to make sure...

870
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:23,612
没人可以找到他的财宝
nobody could ever get to his treasure...

871
00:57:23,655 --> 00:57:26,646
所以，我帮了他
so I helped him...

872
00:57:26,691 --> 00:57:29,249
啊！数据错误！重新启动！
Aah! Data inaccessible! Reboot!

873
00:57:29,293 --> 00:57:31,488
本？本？本！ 重新启动....
B.E.N.? B.E.N.? B.E.N.!

874
00:57:31,527 --> 00:57:34,120
重新启动！啊！你是？
Reboot! Aah! And you are?

875
00:57:34,162 --> 00:57:35,527
等等，财宝怎么样了？
Wait, wait, wait!

876
00:57:35,565 --> 00:57:36,997
我要说，拉里
I want to say Larry.

877
00:57:37,032 --> 00:57:39,192
机械装置的核心...
The--the centroid of the mechanism, or--

878
00:57:39,233 --> 00:57:42,396
对不起，我的内存已经改变
I'm sorry. My memory isn't what it used to be.

879
00:57:42,435 --> 00:57:42,502
我都忘了，哈哈！ 我都忘了！
I've lost my mind. Ha ha! I've lost my mind.

880
00:57:42,503 --> 00:57:45,529
我都忘了，哈哈！ 我都忘了！
I've lost my mind. Ha ha! I've lost my mind.

881
00:57:45,573 --> 00:57:47,004
你有没有找到它？
You haven't found it, have you?

882
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:50,737
哦，我丢了的那一块？ 我的主存储器电路？
Uh, my missing piece? My primary memory circuit?

883
00:57:50,777 --> 00:57:55,305
本，我真的要 找一个可以藏身的地方？OK？
Look, B.E.N., I really need to find a place to hide, OK?

884
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:59,373
所以，我只是想， 你知道的，继续前进
So I'm just gonna be, you know, moving on.

885
00:57:59,417 --> 00:58:02,873
哦，哦，好了，那...
Oh, uh, so, well, then...

886
00:58:02,919 --> 00:58:06,787
我想这就是分别了？
I guess, uh... this is good-bye, huh?

887
00:58:06,821 --> 00:58:11,723
我对我程序紊乱表示道歉
I'm sorry that I'm so dysfunctional.

888
00:58:11,759 --> 00:58:16,787
好了，你走你的吧 我明白
So, uh, go ahead and... I do understand.

889
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:20,287
我明白，再见
I do. Bye-bye.

890
00:58:23,436 --> 00:58:25,903
好了，你要是不想一个人呆着
Look, if you're gonna come along...

891
00:58:25,937 --> 00:58:27,633
你就不要再说什么了
you're gonna have to stop talking.

892
00:58:27,672 --> 00:58:31,268
呜呼！哈哈哈！ 真是太好了
Huzzah! Ha ha ha! Oh, this is fantastic!

893
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:35,073
我和我最好的伙伴要找一个...÷
Me and my best buddy are lookin' for a...

894
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,579
小声点
Being quiet.

895
00:58:38,615 --> 00:58:40,913
你以后不要再碰我
And you have to stop touching me.

896
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:44,612
以后我都不许 碰你，跟你说话！
Touching and talking. That's my two big no-nos.

897
00:58:44,652 --> 00:58:46,711
好了，现在，我想...
OK. Now, I think

898
00:58:46,753 --> 00:58:49,846
听着，在我们开始找之前
Say, listen, before we go out on our big search...

899
00:58:49,889 --> 00:58:54,383
嗯，您是不是先看看我的地方？
um, would you mind if we made a quick pit stop at my place?

900
00:58:54,427 --> 00:58:56,394
挺急迫的，呵呵
Kind of urgent.

901
00:58:56,429 --> 00:58:59,956
本，我想这正是我想要的
I think you just solved my problem.

902
00:59:04,067 --> 00:59:06,001
不好意思，我这里那么乱
Uh. pardon the mess. people.

903
00:59:06,035 --> 00:59:07,161
你们可以想象， 这一百多年来
You'd think in a hundred years...

904
00:59:07,203 --> 00:59:09,034
这里布满了灰尘
I would've dusted a little more often...

905
00:59:09,071 --> 00:59:11,403
但是，你们住进来了
but, you know, when you're batchin' it...

906
00:59:11,441 --> 00:59:14,033
我会收拾好的
you tend to, uh, let things go.

907
00:59:14,075 --> 00:59:16,305
啊，真是太可爱了
Aw, isn't that sweet?

908
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:19,609
我发现过去流行的罗曼史是那么动人！
I find old-fashioned romance so touching, don't you?

909
00:59:19,648 --> 00:59:21,478
我们是不是要为 这对快乐的夫妻喝一杯？
How about drinks for the happy couple?

910
00:59:21,514 --> 00:59:23,674
哦，哦，哦！不！
Oh, uh, ooh. Uh, no.

911
00:59:23,716 --> 00:59:25,616
谢谢，我们不喝酒
Thank you, we don't drink...

912
00:59:25,652 --> 00:59:27,914
还有，我们不是夫妻
and, uh, we're not a couple.

913
00:59:29,988 --> 00:59:32,456
啊哈，看这些标记
Ahem. Look at these markings.

914
00:59:32,490 --> 00:59:35,822
和地图上的一模一样
They're identical to the ones on the map.

915
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:39,757
我猜想这是远古文化中 的象形文字留下来的
I suspect these are the hieroglyphic remnants...of an ancient culture.

916
00:59:39,795 --> 00:59:41,286
霍金斯先生
Mr. Hawkins...

917
00:59:41,331 --> 00:59:44,266
别让任何人靠近
stop anyone who tries to approach. Ohh!

918
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:45,857
是的，是的，现在听我说
Yes, yes. Now listen to me...

919
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:50,097
不要操心指挥的事， 安静的躺一会儿
stop giving orders for a few milliseconds and lie still.

920
00:59:50,138 --> 00:59:52,229
不错的建议，博士
Very forceful, Doctor.

921
00:59:52,272 --> 00:59:54,331
继续，说点别的
Go on. Say something else.

922
00:59:54,375 --> 00:59:54,545
嘿，看那儿，还有几个你们的朋友
Hey. Iook! There's some more of your buddies!

923
00:59:54,545 --> 00:59:57,775
嘿，看那儿，还有几个你们的朋友
Hey. Iook! There's some more of your buddies!

924
00:59:57,813 --> 01:00:00,782
嗨，伙计们！ 我们在这儿！
Hey, fellas! We're over here, fellas!

925
01:00:00,816 --> 01:00:03,908
哦哦哦！
Oh! Uhh! Ooh! Ohh!

926
01:00:05,986 --> 01:00:10,183
不要浪费子弹！
Stop wastin' your fire!

927
01:00:11,223 --> 01:00:13,715
你们好啊，上面的人！
Hello. up there!

928
01:00:16,227 --> 01:00:17,923
吉姆？
Jimbo?

929
01:00:17,963 --> 01:00:21,329
你和船长他们都好吗？
If it's all right with the captain...

930
01:00:21,365 --> 01:00:24,265
我跟你说句话
I'd like a short word with ya.

931
01:00:24,302 --> 01:00:27,895
不是圈套
No tricks,

932
01:00:27,936 --> 01:00:30,633
肯定是冲着地图来的
Come to bargain for the map, doubtless.

933
01:00:30,673 --> 01:00:31,800
这个垃圾...
Pestilential...

934
01:00:31,841 --> 01:00:33,900
-啊！ -船长
-Ugh! -Captain.

935
01:00:33,942 --> 01:00:39,379
那就是说， 他还以为地图在我们手上？
That means...that he thinks we still have it.

936
01:00:44,284 --> 01:00:50,221
啊，墨菲， 我还以为你跑哪儿去了呢
Ah, Morphy! I wondered where you was off to.

937
01:00:53,858 --> 01:00:55,086
哦
Ooh.

938
01:00:55,125 --> 01:00:58,423
哦，这条老腿
Oh, this poor old leg's downright snarky...

939
01:00:58,461 --> 01:01:01,430
我们在船上的那次 捉迷藏之后就不中用了
since that game attack we had in the galley.

940
01:01:03,532 --> 01:01:05,124
啊
Ahh.

941
01:01:07,201 --> 01:01:10,135
无论你在那里听到了什么
Whatever you heard back there...

942
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:12,435
至少那些关于你的
at least the part concerning you...

943
01:01:12,473 --> 01:01:16,340
我说的都是实话
I didn't mean a word of it.

944
01:01:16,375 --> 01:01:20,504
那些残忍的家伙 都认为我变的心软了
Had that bloodthirsty lot thought I'd gone soft...

945
01:01:20,545 --> 01:01:22,978
他们会把我们两个都杀了
they'd have gutted us both.

946
01:01:25,116 --> 01:01:29,644
听着，如果我们处理得当
Listen to me. If we play our cards right...

947
01:01:29,685 --> 01:01:34,986
有了这些钱， 我们可以去当国王了
we can both walk away from this rich as kings.

948
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:37,458
-是吗？ -呵呵呵
-Yeah? -Ha ha ha.

949
01:01:37,493 --> 01:01:40,586
你把地图给我
You get me that map...

950
01:01:40,629 --> 01:01:42,391
哦
and, uh...

951
01:01:42,429 --> 01:01:46,921
财宝中的很大一部分， 就是你的了
an even portion of the treasure is yours.

952
01:01:52,639 --> 01:01:54,970
孩子
Boy.

953
01:01:55,007 --> 01:02:00,404
你在船上说的那些 冠冕堂皇的话都是真心的吗？
You are really something.All that talk of greatness...

954
01:02:00,444 --> 01:02:04,036
让我看到了希望... 呵呵，真是可笑
Iight coming off my sails... what a joke.

955
01:02:04,078 --> 01:02:05,876
看着我，吉姆
Now, just see here, Jimbo--

956
01:02:05,915 --> 01:02:07,143
我想，至少
I mean, at least

957
01:02:07,182 --> 01:02:08,545
要坚持下去，是不是？
Stick to it, right?

958
01:02:08,583 --> 01:02:10,551
对了，那就是我要做的
Well, that's just what I'm gonna do.

959
01:02:10,585 --> 01:02:12,212
我会让你永远看不到
I'm gonna make sure that you never see...

960
01:02:12,254 --> 01:02:14,879
我的那些财宝
one drabloon of my treasure!

961
01:02:14,921 --> 01:02:18,449
那些财宝是属于我的！
That treasure is owed me,

962
01:02:18,492 --> 01:02:22,860
好了，那你就试着 不要用我的地图，去找到它吧
Well, try to find it without my map, by thunder!

963
01:02:22,894 --> 01:02:27,989
哦，你还不知道 怎么发挥你的斗志是不是？
Oh, you still don't know how to pick your fights, do you, boy?

964
01:02:28,031 --> 01:02:31,469
好，看着我
Now, mark me.

965
01:02:31,503 --> 01:02:35,129
你有两个选择： 天亮之前把地图给我
Either I get that map by dawn tomorrow...

966
01:02:35,171 --> 01:02:39,301
或是协助我， 否则，我会用船上的大炮
or so help me, I'll use the ship's cannons...

967
01:02:39,341 --> 01:02:43,140
把你们炸烂！
to blast ya all to kingdom come!

968
01:02:43,178 --> 01:02:46,203
墨菲，跟我走
Morph, hop to it.

969
01:02:47,581 --> 01:02:49,047
马上过来！
Now!

970
01:02:51,618 --> 01:02:53,381
哦，见鬼！
Oh, blast it!

971
01:03:05,027 --> 01:03:06,825
先生们
Gentlemen...

972
01:03:06,863 --> 01:03:10,798
我们必须呆在一起， 还有...
we must stay together and...

973
01:03:10,833 --> 01:03:12,664
还有...哦
and...ohh.

974
01:03:12,702 --> 01:03:14,497
还有什么？什么？
And what? What?!

975
01:03:14,536 --> 01:03:17,061
我们必须呆在一起， 还有什么？
We must stay together and what?!

976
01:03:17,105 --> 01:03:22,598
博士，你的眼睛真迷人
Doctor,

977
01:03:22,642 --> 01:03:24,236
她已经神智不清了
She's lost her mind!

978
01:03:24,278 --> 01:03:25,505
哦，你应该赶紧帮帮她
Well, you gotta help her.

979
01:03:25,545 --> 01:03:27,875
该死，吉姆，我是个 天文学家，不是医生
Dang it, Jim. I'm an astronomer, not a doctor.

980
01:03:27,913 --> 01:03:30,279
我是说，我是个博士
I mean, I am a doctor,

981
01:03:30,315 --> 01:03:31,941
我有博士头衔， 但那不是一回事儿
I have a doctorate. It's not the same thing.

982
01:03:31,983 --> 01:03:33,450
这博士头衔救不了人
You can't help people with a doctorate.

983
01:03:33,484 --> 01:03:36,009
你怎么只是坐在那里， 也不来帮忙？
You just sit there, and you're useless.

984
01:03:36,052 --> 01:03:38,315
好了，博士
It's OK, Doc.

985
01:03:38,355 --> 01:03:40,082
没事的
It's all right.

986
01:03:40,122 --> 01:03:43,525
是的，博士！ 吉姆知道怎么离开这里。
Yeah, Doc! Jimmy knows exactly how to get out of this.

987
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:46,686
只有吉姆能想到这些办法
It's just Jimmy has this knowledge of things.

988
01:03:46,793 --> 01:03:50,355
吉姆，有主意了吗？
Jim, any thoughts at all?

989
01:03:50,398 --> 01:03:53,491
没有地图，我们就完蛋了
Without the map, we're dead.

990
01:03:54,668 --> 01:03:57,500
我们想要逃走， 肯定是死
If we try to leave, we're dead.

991
01:03:57,536 --> 01:03:59,526
-呆在这里... -我们死定了
-lf we stay here-- -We're dead!

992
01:03:59,572 --> 01:04:01,039
我们死定了！我们死定了！
We're dead! We're dead!

993
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:09,838
好了，我想吉姆要静下来想想。
Well, I think that Jimmy could use a little quiet time. Heh.

994
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:13,109
所以，我要从后门出去了
So I'll just slip out the back door.

995
01:04:13,149 --> 01:04:15,343
-后门？ -是的
-Back door? -Oh, yeah.

996
01:04:15,383 --> 01:04:17,543
我从这儿可以轻松逃走
I get this delightful breeze through here...

997
01:04:17,586 --> 01:04:18,848
我想这很重要
which I think is important...

998
01:04:18,887 --> 01:04:20,285
因为在朋友之间活动...
because ventilation among friends--

999
01:04:20,321 --> 01:04:22,881
哇，这是什么？
Whoa. What is all this stuff?

1000
01:04:22,922 --> 01:04:25,186
你是说那些远处的机器
You mean the miles and miles of machinery that run...

1001
01:04:25,226 --> 01:04:27,455
在行星中是怎么运转的吗？
through the entire course of the inside of this planet?

1002
01:04:27,493 --> 01:04:29,188
你在说什么？
Not a clue.

1003
01:04:29,229 --> 01:04:31,629
博士，博士， 我想我找到出口了
Hey, Doc! Doc! I think I found a way out of here!

1004
01:04:31,664 --> 01:04:34,130
不，不，吉姆，等等 船长让我们呆在一起
No, no. Jim, wait.

1005
01:04:34,165 --> 01:04:37,064
-我会回来的 -冲啊！
-I'll be back. -Cannonball!

1006
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:38,692
呜呼！
Woof.

1007
01:04:46,941 --> 01:04:49,466
-有什么计划？ -嘘，本，安静！
-So, what's the plan? -Shh. B.E.N., quiet.

1008
01:04:53,581 --> 01:04:54,945
好了，是这样
OK, here it is.

1009
01:04:54,983 --> 01:04:58,509
我们偷偷回到船上， 毁掉激光炮
We sneak back to the Legacy, disable the laser cannons...

1010
01:04:58,550 --> 01:05:00,213
把地图带回来
and bring back the map.

1011
01:05:00,254 --> 01:05:01,481
计划听起来很不错
That's a good plan.

1012
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,111
我喜欢。 只是..
I like that plan. The only thing is...

1013
01:05:03,153 --> 01:05:05,587
我想我们要怎么回去？
I'm wondering, how do we get there?

1014
01:05:05,624 --> 01:05:07,056
用那个
On that.

1015
01:05:07,092 --> 01:05:09,252
哦
Ooh.

1016
01:05:13,496 --> 01:05:15,826
哦
Oop?

1017
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:19,733
啊！ -本，嘘！
Aah! -B.E.N.. shh!

1018
01:05:19,768 --> 01:05:22,827
对不起，对不起，对不起
Sorry. sorry. Sorry.

1019
01:05:29,276 --> 01:05:31,938
好了，我去拿地图， 你呆在这里！
OK, I'll get the map. You wait here.

1020
01:05:31,977 --> 01:05:34,639
收到，吉米。 我会看着激光炮的！
Roger, Jimmy. I'll neutralize laser cannons, sir!

1021
01:05:34,679 --> 01:05:36,146
本！本！
B.E.N.! B.E.N.!

1022
01:05:36,181 --> 01:05:38,977
哟呼，哟呼 我也过上海盗生活了
Yo-ho. yo-ho. a pirate's life for me

1023
01:05:41,319 --> 01:05:45,277
破坏激光炮。 我应该怎么做呢？
Disable a few laser cannons. What is the big deal?

1024
01:05:45,322 --> 01:05:48,017
我要做的只是找到那条线
All we gotta do is find that one little wire.

1025
01:05:48,057 --> 01:05:51,718
哦，我的妈
Oh, mama.

1026
01:05:56,563 --> 01:05:58,292
就是你了
Yes.

1027
01:05:59,667 --> 01:06:01,463
坏了，本，坏事了
Bad, B.E.N. Bad.

1028
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:02,626
好了，修好了
OK, fixing.

1029
01:06:02,669 --> 01:06:05,638
那愚蠢的机器人 会害死我们的
That stupid robot's gonna get us all...killed.

1030
01:06:05,672 --> 01:06:07,934
服务生！
Cabin boy.

1031
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:17,809
啊！
Aah!

1032
01:06:35,294 --> 01:06:37,694
喔，OK，不着急
Whoops. OK. don't panic.

1033
01:06:37,729 --> 01:06:40,059
吸气，呼气
Breathing in... breathing out...

1034
01:06:54,843 --> 01:06:55,968
-啊！ -呣？
-Aah! -Hmm?

1035
01:06:56,009 --> 01:06:57,773
啊！
Raah!

1036
01:07:01,515 --> 01:07:03,071
这条应该是激光炮的了
This has gotta be cannons.

1037
01:07:04,585 --> 01:07:05,642
完了，不是
Maybe not.

1038
01:07:12,957 --> 01:07:14,185
啊！
Rraar!

1039
01:07:21,631 --> 01:07:24,121
呵呵
Heh heh.

1040
01:07:28,470 --> 01:07:30,800
过来，过来，过来
Come on, come on, come on.

1041
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:32,498
不！
No!

1042
01:07:32,539 --> 01:07:34,802
哦，好极了！
Oh, yes.

1043
01:07:34,841 --> 01:07:37,968
记得跟埃柔先生问好
Do say hello to Mr. Arrow.

1044
01:07:39,911 --> 01:07:41,641
啊！
Rraar!

1045
01:07:41,679 --> 01:07:43,511
你自己跟他说吧！
Tell him yourself!

1046
01:07:46,717 --> 01:07:51,779
啊——！
Aah!

1047
01:07:53,256 --> 01:07:56,486
给我回去， 你这淘气的插头！
Back you go, you naughty plug! Oh!

1048
01:07:56,525 --> 01:07:59,585
哦！
Unh!

1049
01:08:06,166 --> 01:08:07,793
墨菲？
Morph?

1050
01:08:07,835 --> 01:08:09,495
激光炮已经破坏
Laser cannons disconnected...

1051
01:08:09,536 --> 01:08:11,092
吉米船长！
Captain Jimmy, sir!

1052
01:08:11,136 --> 01:08:13,229
并不是很难
Gee, that wasn't so tough.

1053
01:08:21,517 --> 01:08:23,246
博士，博士！醒醒！
Doc! Doc, wake up!

1054
01:08:23,285 --> 01:08:26,482
我找到地图了
I got the map.

1055
01:08:26,521 --> 01:08:31,788
干得好，吉姆 谢谢你帮我
Fine work, Jimbo.

1056
01:08:35,929 --> 01:08:38,725
孩子，谢谢你帮我们找到那条路
Thanks for showing us the way, boy.

1057
01:08:42,168 --> 01:08:44,066
啊！
Aah!

1058
01:08:46,837 --> 01:08:49,238
这堆烂铁是什么玩意儿？
What's this sorry stack of metal?!

1059
01:08:49,273 --> 01:08:50,570
不要碰我的脸！
Not the face!

1060
01:08:50,607 --> 01:08:53,475
吉姆，你跟我一样
You're just like me, Jimbo.

1061
01:08:53,511 --> 01:08:56,603
你讨厌失败
Ya hates to lose.

1062
01:09:04,985 --> 01:09:07,351
怎么回事？
What the devil's the...

1063
01:09:11,425 --> 01:09:13,051
打开它
Open it.

1064
01:09:21,765 --> 01:09:24,132
我得开始工作了
I'd get busy.

1065
01:09:40,747 --> 01:09:44,374
看到没，多么神奇啊
Oh, the powers that be. Would you look?

1066
01:09:48,586 --> 01:09:50,780
哈哈哈哈
Ha ha ha ha!

1067
01:09:50,822 --> 01:09:54,814
绑紧他让他们一起呆着， 直到我们...什么？
Tie him up and leave him with the others till we--what?

1068
01:09:55,891 --> 01:09:57,450
你要地图
You want the map...

1069
01:09:57,493 --> 01:09:59,325
就把我带上
you're taking me, too.

1070
01:10:02,697 --> 01:10:04,165
呣
Hmm.

1071
01:10:07,302 --> 01:10:09,133
把他们都带走
We'll take 'em all.

1072
01:10:20,878 --> 01:10:22,642
哦
Unh.

1073
01:10:31,489 --> 01:10:34,184
没事，墨菲，没事的
It's OK, Morph. It's OK.

1074
01:10:34,222 --> 01:10:36,122
吉米，我不知道你为什么...
Jimmy, l--I don't know about you...

1075
01:10:36,158 --> 01:10:39,990
我看到我的一生在我眼前滑过
but I'm starting to see my life pass in front of my eyes.

1076
01:10:40,027 --> 01:10:42,017
至少，那是我的一生
At least, I think it's my life.

1077
01:10:42,062 --> 01:10:45,190
我和一个叫着卢皮的机器人跳过舞？
Was I ever dancing with an android named Lupe?!

1078
01:10:45,231 --> 01:10:47,358
本，嘘
B.E.N., shh.

1079
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,559
还没完
This isn't over yet.

1080
01:10:50,770 --> 01:10:53,238
伙计们，我们越来越靠近了
We're gettin' close. Iads.

1081
01:10:53,272 --> 01:10:56,534
我闻到了财宝的味道... 它就在前面
I smell treasure a-waitin'.

1082
01:11:01,779 --> 01:11:02,904
哦？
Huh?

1083
01:11:02,944 --> 01:11:05,004
在哪儿？
Where is it?

1084
01:11:05,046 --> 01:11:09,540
我什么都没看到！ 狗屎，怎么什么都没有？
I see nothing! One great, big stinking hunk of nothing!

1085
01:11:09,584 --> 01:11:12,485
怎么回事，吉姆？
What's going on, Jimbo?

1086
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:15,386
我不知道， 我打不开了
I don't know. I can't get it open.

1087
01:11:15,421 --> 01:11:18,118
我们早就不该跟着这小子了！
We should've never followed this boy!

1088
01:11:18,157 --> 01:11:19,591
嘿！
Hey!

1089
01:11:19,626 --> 01:11:21,389
我劝你最好
I'd suggest you get...

1090
01:11:21,427 --> 01:11:23,554
把那东西弄好！快点！
that gizmo going again. and fast!

1091
01:11:23,596 --> 01:11:26,893
把他杀了，剖开他的肚子！
Let's rip his gizzard right out right now!

1092
01:11:26,930 --> 01:11:29,558
把他从山崖上扔下去！
Throw him off the cliff!

1093
01:11:50,649 --> 01:11:53,049
哦，原谅他吧
Oh, have mercy.

1094
01:11:54,487 --> 01:11:56,851
星云图？
The Lagoon Nebula?

1095
01:11:56,887 --> 01:12:00,449
那只是星系中的一部分
But that's halfway across the galaxy.

1096
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:04,627
有个大门
A big door...

1097
01:12:04,661 --> 01:12:06,788
开开关关
opening and closing.

1098
01:12:10,698 --> 01:12:12,495
让我看看
Let's see.

1099
01:12:12,534 --> 01:12:15,991
金纳皮斯（地名）
Kinapis.

1100
01:12:16,037 --> 01:12:17,663
蒙特里莎空间站
Montressor spaceport.

1101
01:12:20,873 --> 01:12:22,841
弗林特就是这么做的
So that's how Flint did it.

1102
01:12:22,875 --> 01:12:28,073
他用这个入口 到世界各地去掠夺财宝的！
He used this portal to roam the universe stealing treasure.

1103
01:12:28,113 --> 01:12:30,513
他把它们都藏到哪儿去了呢？
But where'd he stash it all?

1104
01:12:31,781 --> 01:12:34,944
那个该死的财宝在哪儿？
Where's that blasted treasure?!

1105
01:12:34,984 --> 01:12:37,145
财宝！财宝！
Treasure! Treasure!

1106
01:12:37,187 --> 01:12:39,177
它被埋在...
It's buried in the--

1107
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:43,555
埋在机器的中央核心处
Buried in the centroid of the mechanism.

1108
01:12:43,592 --> 01:12:47,391
如果这个行星就是那个机器
What if the whole planet is the mechanism...

1109
01:12:47,428 --> 01:12:51,692
财宝就埋在行星的中央
and the treasure is buried in the center of this planet?

1110
01:12:55,402 --> 01:12:58,426
太令人失望了， 我们怎么样才能到那里？
And how in blue blazes are we supposed to get there?

1111
01:12:58,470 --> 01:13:01,927
只要打开右边的门就可以了
Just open the right door.

1112
01:13:18,657 --> 01:13:21,953
等等我！等等我！
Wait for me! Wait for me!

1113
01:13:30,699 --> 01:13:35,102
从数千个世界掠夺来的战利品
The loot of a thousand worlds.

1114
01:13:38,071 --> 01:13:41,234
我们要一只更大的船！
We are going to need a bigger boat!

1115
01:13:53,684 --> 01:13:56,981
这怎么看起来这么眼熟？
This is all seeming very familiar.

1116
01:13:59,020 --> 01:14:02,616
为什么？
I can't remember why.

1117
01:14:02,657 --> 01:14:03,954
本，跟我来
B.E.N., come on.

1118
01:14:03,992 --> 01:14:06,426
我们离开这里， 但不能空手离开
We're getting out of here, and we're not leaving empty-handed.

1119
01:14:06,461 --> 01:14:08,620
但是，但是，吉米，吉米！
But--but, Jimmy! Jimmy!

1120
01:14:10,029 --> 01:14:13,658
我这一生的追求
A lifetime of searching.

1121
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:16,759
最后
And at long last...

1122
01:14:17,869 --> 01:14:20,633
我终于找到了
I can touch it.

1123
01:14:20,671 --> 01:14:21,865
你没觉得奇怪吗？
Do you know what's strange?

1124
01:14:21,906 --> 01:14:23,806
我没法阻止这件事情发生，吉米
I can't tell you how frustrating this is, Jimmy...

1125
01:14:23,841 --> 01:14:25,330
因为有些想法...
'cause there's something just--

1126
01:14:25,374 --> 01:14:27,466
在我的脑子里盘旋不去
it's nagging at the back of my mind.

1127
01:14:27,510 --> 01:14:29,206
啊！
Aah!

1128
01:14:29,246 --> 01:14:32,736
-弗林特船长？ -还是个人形！
-Captain Flint? -ln the flesh!

1129
01:14:32,781 --> 01:14:36,580
哦，还保持完好
Well, s-sort of,

1130
01:14:36,618 --> 01:14:39,313
或者说是像个人形
or anything that--that--that resembles flesh...

1131
01:14:39,353 --> 01:14:41,343
不是的
that's not there.

1132
01:14:41,387 --> 01:14:43,447
怎么这么奇怪？ 你看出来了吗？
And yet it's so odd. you know?

1133
01:14:43,490 --> 01:14:46,550
我记得有些很恐怖的事
I remember there was something horrible...

1134
01:14:46,592 --> 01:14:48,652
弗林特不想任何人知道...
Flint didn't want anyone else to know...

1135
01:14:48,694 --> 01:14:52,686
但是我就是想不起来是什么
but I--I just can't remember what it was.

1136
01:14:52,731 --> 01:14:56,096
哦，一件很恐怖的事情...
Oh, a mind

1137
01:14:58,268 --> 01:15:00,758
本，我想我找到你的脑子了
B.E.N.,

1138
01:15:00,803 --> 01:15:01,997
别动
Hold still.

1139
01:15:02,037 --> 01:15:05,233
啊！吉米，你的手太冰了
Aah! Jimmy, your hands are very, very cold.

1140
01:15:07,008 --> 01:15:08,736
哇！
Whoa!

1141
01:15:08,776 --> 01:15:10,676
你好啊
Hello.

1142
01:15:10,711 --> 01:15:13,305
哦，吉米，我在想...
You know, uh, Jimmy, I was just thinking...

1143
01:15:13,347 --> 01:15:15,872
我在想...
I was just think--

1144
01:15:15,915 --> 01:15:18,941
我的记忆全回来了
It's all flooding back! All my memories!

1145
01:15:18,985 --> 01:15:20,713
对了，弗林特把我的存储器电路拔下来
Right up until Flint pulled my memory circuits...

1146
01:15:20,753 --> 01:15:23,654
我就无法告诉 别人他设下的陷阱！
so I could never tell anybody about his booby trap!

1147
01:15:24,922 --> 01:15:27,914
-说什么？ -啊？
-Speaking of which... -Huh?

1148
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:30,986
弗林特要保证...
Flint wanted to make sure...

1149
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:32,426
没人可以偷走他的财宝
that nobody could ever steal his treasure...

1150
01:15:32,462 --> 01:15:33,723
所以，他控制了整个行星
so he rigged this whole planet...

1151
01:15:33,763 --> 01:15:37,061
它会把你炸得比卡勒希安风筝还高
to blow higher than a Kalepsian kite!

1152
01:15:47,841 --> 01:15:49,740
快跑，吉米！快逃命吧！
Run, Jimmy! Run for your life!

1153
01:15:49,776 --> 01:15:51,300
你回去帮船长和博士！
You go back and help the captain and Doc!

1154
01:15:51,343 --> 01:15:54,675
如果我5分钟之后还没回去 你们就先走
If I'm not there in 5 minutes,

1155
01:15:54,712 --> 01:15:57,873
我不会离开我的朋友，吉米
I am not leaving my buddy Jimmy.

1156
01:15:57,915 --> 01:16:01,042
除非他这么看着我
Unless he looks at me like that.

1157
01:16:01,084 --> 01:16:02,414
再见，吉姆
Bye, Jim!

1158
01:16:08,924 --> 01:16:12,325
不！不！哦！不！哦！不！
No! No! Oh, no! Oh, no!

1159
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:13,485
不！啊！
No! Aah!

1160
01:16:15,262 --> 01:16:18,992
-啊！ -啊！
-Aah! -Aah!

1161
01:16:22,968 --> 01:16:25,697
回来，笨蛋！
Come back here, ya blighters!

1162
01:16:41,150 --> 01:16:45,482
我这一生都想要 一次像这样的冒险
All my life, I dreamed of an adventure like this.

1163
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:47,510
哦，对不起
I'm just sorry...

1164
01:16:47,555 --> 01:16:50,751
我不能好好的帮你
I couldn't have been more helpful to you.

1165
01:16:50,790 --> 01:16:52,758
哦，别傻了
Oh, don't be daft.

1166
01:16:52,792 --> 01:16:56,521
其实，你已经帮了我很多
You've been very helpful. Truly.

1167
01:16:56,562 --> 01:17:01,760
我觉得自己就像 一个无能的家伙
I feel like such a useless weakling...

1168
01:17:01,799 --> 01:17:04,359
我没用多大劲啊
with abnormally thin wrists.

1169
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:06,595
对不起，海盗先生
Excuse me, brutish pirate.

1170
01:17:07,803 --> 01:17:09,600
对了，就是你，我有个问题
Yes, you. I have a question.

1171
01:17:09,639 --> 01:17:11,869
你的身材对于你那小小的脑袋
Is it that your body is too massive...

1172
01:17:11,907 --> 01:17:13,431
是不是太过于臃肿了？
for your teeny-tiny head...

1173
01:17:13,475 --> 01:17:15,908
或者说是你的脑袋对于你壮硕的身躯
or is it that your head is too teeny-tiny...

1174
01:17:15,944 --> 01:17:18,811
太过渺小了？
for your big, fat body?

1175
01:17:18,847 --> 01:17:20,938
我要好好教训你！
I pummel you good!

1176
01:17:20,981 --> 01:17:23,280
是的，我想你会这么做的。 但这之前
Yes, I'm sure you will, but before you do...

1177
01:17:23,317 --> 01:17:26,341
我还有一个问题。 这是你的吗？
I have one more question. Is this yours?

1178
01:17:26,385 --> 01:17:27,785
哦
Uhh...

1179
01:17:34,592 --> 01:17:36,787
是的！墨菲， 我们就要出去了！
Yes! Morph, we are so out of here!

1180
01:17:38,295 --> 01:17:39,784
啊，吉姆！
Ah. Jimbo!

1181
01:17:40,997 --> 01:17:44,830
你真是世界的第七大奇迹！
Aren't you the seventh wonder of the universe?

1182
01:17:44,867 --> 01:17:47,301
退回去！
Get back!

1183
01:17:51,405 --> 01:17:55,340
我喜欢你，小伙子 我远道而来
I like you, lad, but I've come too far...

1184
01:17:55,375 --> 01:17:57,740
你却阻扰我拿回我的财宝
to let you stand between me and me treasure.

1185
01:18:02,813 --> 01:18:04,440
啊！
Aah!

1186
01:18:17,659 --> 01:18:20,355
哦，不，哦，不要！
Oh, no, you don't!

1187
01:18:29,069 --> 01:18:30,263
什么？
What?

1188
01:18:34,406 --> 01:18:35,805
吉姆
Jimbo.

1189
01:18:38,675 --> 01:18:40,802
抓住了
Reach for me now!

1190
01:18:40,843 --> 01:18:43,811
抓住！
Reach!

1191
01:18:43,845 --> 01:18:45,608
我...我够不着！
I--I can't!

1192
01:18:45,647 --> 01:18:48,207
啊！
Aah!

1193
01:18:54,423 --> 01:18:56,116
我...
I...

1194
01:19:00,693 --> 01:19:05,823
哦，我简直就是个疯子！
Oh, blast me for a fool!

1195
01:19:05,863 --> 01:19:07,387
啊！
Aah!

1196
01:19:28,591 --> 01:19:30,388
席尔瓦，你放弃了？
Silver, you gave up?

1197
01:19:30,427 --> 01:19:34,294
它困扰了我一生，吉姆！ 我会克服的！
Just a lifelong obsession, Jim. I'll get over it.

1198
01:19:34,330 --> 01:19:36,161
欢迎你回来，吉米！
Aloha. Jimmy!

1199
01:19:38,467 --> 01:19:40,298
快点！只剩2分34秒
Hurry, people! We got exactly two minutes...

1200
01:19:40,335 --> 01:19:43,324
行星就要爆炸了
and thirty-four seconds till planet's destruction!

1201
01:19:43,369 --> 01:19:44,667
做的很好，博士
You're doing fine, Doctor.

1202
01:19:44,704 --> 01:19:46,934
现在让它放松一点， 慢慢来，慢慢来！
Now ease her over gently--gently!

1203
01:19:48,307 --> 01:19:52,504
啊！我们呆在行星上都比这好
Aah! We were better off on exploding planet!

1204
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:56,744
赶紧让我们离开这里，金属人！
Take us out of here, metal man!

1205
01:19:56,780 --> 01:19:58,271
遵命，船长
Aye, Captain!

1206
01:20:01,884 --> 01:20:04,682
船长，你简直就是神女下凡...
Captain, you dropped from the heavens in the nick of--

1207
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:07,448
把讨好的话跟法官说吧，席尔瓦
Save your claptrap for the judge, Silver!

1208
01:20:17,865 --> 01:20:19,525
导弹尾部被破坏了
Missile tail demobilized,

1209
01:20:19,565 --> 01:20:21,328
推进器只剩30％的能量
Thrusters at only 30% of capacity.

1210
01:20:21,367 --> 01:20:23,301
30％？就是说，我们...
30%? That means we're--

1211
01:20:23,335 --> 01:20:26,428
我们无法在行星爆炸之前离开了
We'll never clear the planet's explosion in time.

1212
01:20:34,310 --> 01:20:37,211
-调头回去。 -什么？
-We gotta turn around. -What?

1213
01:20:37,246 --> 01:20:40,146
那里有个入口， 我们可以从那里离开
There's a portal back there. It can get us out of here!

1214
01:20:40,182 --> 01:20:42,479
对不起，吉姆。 那个入口还没打开
Pardon me. Jim. but didn't that portal open...

1215
01:20:42,518 --> 01:20:44,677
回到火一般的地狱？
onto a raging inferno?!

1216
01:20:44,718 --> 01:20:47,687
是的，我要把更改入口
Yes, but I'm gonna change that.

1217
01:20:47,721 --> 01:20:50,382
打开另外一个门
I'm gonna open a different door.

1218
01:20:51,724 --> 01:20:53,022
船长，真的吗？ 我觉得那太不可思议
Captain, really, I don't see how this is possible--

1219
01:20:53,059 --> 01:20:55,219
照着他说的做
Listen to the boy!

1220
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:57,819
离行星爆炸还有1分20秒
One minute, twenty-nine seconds till planet's destruction!

1221
01:20:57,861 --> 01:21:01,354
-我们还要怎么做？吉姆？ -想想怎么绑住这东西！
-What do you need, Jim? -Just some way to attach this.

1222
01:21:01,399 --> 01:21:03,889
好的，后退，后退一点！
All right. Stand back. Stand back, now.

1223
01:21:05,502 --> 01:21:07,731
可以走了
There you go.

1224
01:21:07,769 --> 01:21:08,963
可以走了
There you go.

1225
01:21:10,072 --> 01:21:12,472
好了，不管发生什么
OK. Now,

1226
01:21:12,508 --> 01:21:14,973
把飞船直接冲向入口
keep the ship heading straight for that portal.

1227
01:21:15,009 --> 01:21:17,875
还剩58秒
Fifty-eight seconds!

1228
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:26,842
好了，你们听到他说的了
Well, you heard him!

1229
01:21:26,884 --> 01:21:30,217
调头
Get this blasted heap turned 'round!

1230
01:21:31,288 --> 01:21:32,812
博士，把船头对准入口
Doctor,

1231
01:21:32,856 --> 01:21:34,222
遵命，船长
Aye, Captain.

1232
01:21:56,808 --> 01:21:58,571
向右，右边！
Go to the right! The right!

1233
01:21:58,609 --> 01:22:02,205
我知道，我知道！ 我只是在试试
I know, I know!

1234
01:22:04,415 --> 01:22:06,281
25秒！
Twenty-five seconds!

1235
01:22:11,221 --> 01:22:12,653
不！不！
No! No!

1236
01:22:16,124 --> 01:22:17,921
加油，小伙子！
Come on, lad.

1237
01:22:19,393 --> 01:22:22,226
17秒！
Seventeen seconds!

1238
01:22:37,275 --> 01:22:38,604
7...
Seven...

1239
01:22:38,641 --> 01:22:41,702
6...5...4...
six... five... four...

1240
01:22:41,744 --> 01:22:44,269
3...2...
three...two...

1241
01:22:52,353 --> 01:22:55,343
哇！吔！
Wow! Y eah!

1242
01:22:55,388 --> 01:22:58,379
你成功了，吉米！
You done it. Jimmy!

1243
01:22:58,424 --> 01:23:02,019
你成功了！哈哈哈！
You done it, boy! Ha ha ha!

1244
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:04,654
我早说过了这孩子很出色！
Didn't I say the lad had greatness in him?

1245
01:23:16,905 --> 01:23:20,601
太好了
Unorthodox,

1246
01:23:20,642 --> 01:23:22,507
我很荣幸把你推荐给
I'd be proud to recommend you...

1247
01:23:22,543 --> 01:23:26,240
星际学院， 他们需要一个像你这样的人
to the interstellar academy. They could use a man like you.

1248
01:23:26,278 --> 01:23:29,214
等着吧， 你妈妈听到这个肯定很高兴！
Just wait until your mother hears about this!

1249
01:23:29,249 --> 01:23:31,408
那当然，我们不用再为生计犯愁了
Of course, we may downplay the life-threatening parts.

1250
01:23:31,450 --> 01:23:35,319
吉米，这真是终生难忘的时刻
Jimmy, that was unforgettable!

1251
01:23:35,354 --> 01:23:36,650
我知道你不喜欢我碰你
I know you don't like touching...

1252
01:23:36,687 --> 01:23:39,918
但是，准备好， 我要好好的拥抱你
but get ready for a hug, big guy, 'cause I gotta hug ya!

1253
01:23:39,958 --> 01:23:41,151
哈哈哈！
Ha ha ha ha!

1254
01:23:43,127 --> 01:23:45,423
嘿，你也回过来抱我了
Hey, you hugged me back.

1255
01:23:45,461 --> 01:23:48,259
哦，我发誓不再哭的
Oh, I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

1256
01:23:54,502 --> 01:23:57,470
你们谁有纸巾？
Does anyone have a tissue?

1257
01:23:58,913 --> 01:24:02,075
-墨菲，我们做标记！ -我知道
-Morphy, we gotta make tracks. -I know.

1258
01:24:02,115 --> 01:24:04,378
你不会离开的，是不是？
You never quit. do you?

1259
01:24:04,417 --> 01:24:07,145
啊，吉姆！哈哈
Ah, Jimbo! Ha ha!

1260
01:24:07,185 --> 01:24:09,246
我只是检查一下，看看...
I was merely checking to make sure...

1261
01:24:09,287 --> 01:24:12,414
看看我们最后 一艘船是不是完好无损！
our last longboat was safe and secure.

1262
01:24:13,558 --> 01:24:16,026
呣！
Mmm.

1263
01:24:16,059 --> 01:24:17,218
哦
Well...

1264
01:24:18,829 --> 01:24:19,988
应该绑紧了
that should hold it.

1265
01:24:20,029 --> 01:24:23,520
呵呵，我教得很好啊
Heh heh heh. I taught you too well.

1266
01:24:25,567 --> 01:24:29,058
如果你不介意， 我可不想进监狱
If you don't mind, we'd just as soon avoid prison.

1267
01:24:29,103 --> 01:24:34,199
小墨菲在这里自由自在
Little morphy here, he's a free spirit.

1268
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:37,970
关在笼子里， 它会很伤心的
Being in a cage, it'd break his heart.

1269
01:24:51,353 --> 01:24:53,343
哦！
Ohh!

1270
01:24:55,589 --> 01:24:58,992
小伙子，跟我一起走吧
What say you ship out with us, lad?

1271
01:24:59,027 --> 01:25:01,357
你和我
You and me,

1272
01:25:01,395 --> 01:25:06,161
只有我们，没人约束我们
full of ourselves and no ties to anyone!

1273
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:12,732
你知道
You know,

1274
01:25:12,771 --> 01:25:16,866
我原本会和你一起走的
I would've taken you up on that offer in a second...

1275
01:25:16,906 --> 01:25:21,240
但是，哦，我有一个很好的朋友
but, uh,

1276
01:25:21,277 --> 01:25:24,734
但是他教过我， 我可以规划我的一生
and he taught me that I could chart my own course.

1277
01:25:27,416 --> 01:25:29,008
那正是我要做的
That's what I'm gonna do.

1278
01:25:29,050 --> 01:25:35,681
那你怎么看你的那个朋友？
And what do you see of that pal of yours?

1279
01:25:35,722 --> 01:25:37,211
是将来
A future.

1280
01:25:37,256 --> 01:25:39,850
为什么？
Why...

1281
01:25:39,893 --> 01:25:44,920
看看你，充满了活力
Iook at ya, glowing like a solar fire.

1282
01:25:44,963 --> 01:25:47,691
你会很出色的，吉姆
You're something special, Jim.

1283
01:25:47,731 --> 01:25:51,860
你会很有成就的
You're gonna rattle the stars, you are.

1284
01:26:00,708 --> 01:26:03,608
我的机器眼睛要加点润滑油了
Got a bit of grease in this cyborg eye of mine.

1285
01:26:09,016 --> 01:26:12,813
哦，嘿，墨菲， 我们还会再见的，OK？
Oh, hey, Morph. I'll see ya around, OK?

1286
01:26:12,850 --> 01:26:14,010
还会再见的！
See ya around.

1287
01:26:23,493 --> 01:26:27,087
墨菲，我要你做件事！
Morphy, I got a job for ya.

1288
01:26:27,129 --> 01:26:32,395
你给我好好盯着这个小子
I need you to keep an eye on this here pup.

1289
01:26:34,769 --> 01:26:37,396
你愿意帮我吗？
Will ya do me that little favor?

1290
01:26:37,438 --> 01:26:38,995
遵命，船长！
Aye-aye, Captain.

1291
01:26:45,945 --> 01:26:48,105
哦，还有件事
Oh, and one more thing.

1292
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:51,912
这是给你妈妈的
This is for your dear mother...

1293
01:26:51,950 --> 01:26:55,041
让她重建她的旅馆！
to rebuild that inn of hers.

1294
01:26:57,186 --> 01:26:57,253
别再惹麻烦了，老家伙！
Stay out of trouble, ya old scalawag.

1295
01:26:57,253 --> 01:27:00,381
别再惹麻烦了，老家伙！
Stay out of trouble, ya old scalawag.

1296
01:27:00,422 --> 01:27:02,982
哈哈，吉姆，小伙子
Why, Jimbo, lad...

1297
01:27:03,024 --> 01:27:05,892
我做过什么吗？
when have I ever done otherwise?

1298
01:27:39,178 --> 01:27:42,171
哦！
Oh!

1299
01:29:12,020 --> 01:29:16,547
（歌词） 沐浴着阳光，我沉醉在这里的一切
It's good to see the sun and feel this place

1300
01:29:16,590 --> 01:29:20,786
从未有如此强烈的家的感觉
This place I never thought would feel like home

1301
01:29:20,826 --> 01:29:23,090
我胆怯
And I ran forever

1302
01:29:23,129 --> 01:29:25,323
远远逃离
Far away

1303
01:29:25,363 --> 01:29:29,959
总以为我要在这里孤独终结
And I always thought I'd end up here alone

1304
01:29:30,001 --> 01:29:33,730
缘何一切突然转变
Somehow the world has changed

1305
01:29:33,769 --> 01:29:35,897
我回来了
And I've come home

1306
01:29:35,939 --> 01:29:40,170
带回了，他们从你身上抢走的
To give you back the things they took from you

1307
01:29:40,209 --> 01:29:42,199
找到了你的感觉
And I feel you now

1308
01:29:42,244 --> 01:29:44,438
我不再孤单
I'm not alone

1309
01:29:44,478 --> 01:29:50,711
我总能感觉到你的存在
I always know where you are

1310
01:29:50,749 --> 01:29:53,150
我看着我自己
When I see myself

1311
01:29:53,185 --> 01:29:59,680
我总能感觉到你的存在
I always know where you are

1312
01:29:59,725 --> 01:30:04,661
你的存在
Where you are

1313
01:30:04,693 --> 01:30:08,755
我发现总有些事情
And I found something that was always there

1314
01:30:08,797 --> 01:30:13,392
它总会在你发现之前伤害你
Sometimes it's got to hurt before you feel

1315
01:30:13,434 --> 01:30:17,802
现在，我长大了，我不会再倒下
But now I'm strong. and I won 't kneel

1316
01:30:17,838 --> 01:30:21,829
感谢所有爱护我的人们
Except to thank who's watching over me

1317
01:30:21,875 --> 01:30:26,037
现在我感觉我如此强大
And somehow I feel so strong

1318
01:30:26,078 --> 01:30:30,014
我已不再是
And I've begun to be the one

1319
01:30:30,049 --> 01:30:32,278
从前的我
I never thought I'd be

1320
01:30:32,316 --> 01:30:34,477
我能真切的感觉到你
And I feel you now

1321
01:30:34,518 --> 01:30:36,952
我不再孤独
I'm not alone

1322
01:30:36,987 --> 01:30:43,049
我总能感觉到你的存在
I always know where you are

1323
01:30:43,091 --> 01:30:45,616
我看着我自己
And when I see myself

1324
01:30:45,660 --> 01:30:51,996
我总能感觉到你的存在
I always know where you are

1325
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:57,400
你的存在
Where you are

1326
01:30:57,435 --> 01:31:00,963
现在一切都如此的美丽
Now it's all so clear

1327
01:31:01,006 --> 01:31:03,304
我坚信
And I believe

1328
01:31:03,341 --> 01:31:07,208
我能克服一切困难
That everything's been opened up to me

1329
01:31:07,243 --> 01:31:09,303
我真切的感觉到你
And I feel you now

1330
01:31:09,345 --> 01:31:11,643
我不再孤独
I'm not alone

1331
01:31:11,681 --> 01:31:13,647
我清楚的知道
I always know

1332
01:31:13,682 --> 01:31:20,212
我总能感觉到你的存在
I always know where you are

1333
01:31:20,254 --> 01:31:22,585
我看着我自己
And when I see myself

1334
01:31:22,623 --> 01:31:28,958
我总能感觉到你的存在
I always know where you are

1335
01:31:28,995 --> 01:31:30,984
我沐浴着阳光
And when I feel the sun

1336
01:31:31,029 --> 01:31:37,558
我总能感觉到你的存在
I always know where you are

1337
01:31:37,601 --> 01:31:40,035
我看着我自己
And when I see myself

1338
01:31:40,070 --> 01:31:46,304
我总能感觉到你的存在
I always know where you are

1339
01:31:46,342 --> 01:31:52,041
你的存在
Where you are

1340
01:31:52,079 --> 01:31:58,967
谢谢观赏
