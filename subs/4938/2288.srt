00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:13,257
我们最初相恋时的梦
# Dreams, dreams of when we had just started things #

4
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:18,262
# 只属于你我的梦 #
# Dreams of me and you #

Nice.

6
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:24,852
# 似乎这些回忆 我无法忘怀 #
# It seems, it seems that I can't shake those memories #

7
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,898
# 你是否也有同感 #
# I wonder if you feel the same way too #

12
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:43,830
我要跟洛杉矶时报的人说点事 你就安静一会儿吧
I have to give a sound bite for the L.A. Times, so no noise for a minute.

13
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,750
我等下可能也有电话 所以如果吵的话 就说明我也在接电话
I might actually get a call too, so if it's noisy, I'll be on a call.

14
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,794
好吧 好了没?
Okay. Ready?

15

All right. This year, all trends will head toward simplicity and comfort.

16
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,175
网络电视播放器...
Things like Roku, Vudu...

17
00:02:56,343 --> 00:03:00,429
菜谱和便装会在市场上大受欢迎

18

19
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,059

21
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,982
说真的 你就不能坐着不动吗?
Seriously, can you not sit still for like two minutes?

22
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,526
我们谈过的 你得戒烟
We talked about this. No more smoking.

- Not doing what?  - I am not doing that.

25
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:21,158
- 它只是一栋建筑  - 我懂了 因为那不是潮流
- It's just a building.  - It's not trending.

26
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:25,496

Wanna go titty for titty? My arms are longer. My boobs are smaller.

27
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,790

- Focus on driving.  - I am focused on dri...

28
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,211
- 很好  - 杰西 那地方真神奇
- Great.  - Jess, that place is amazing.

29
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,213
我在接重要电话
I'm on a really important call.

30
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,591

- Was that about the magazine job?  - No.

35
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,062
不过 塞莱斯特 昨晚有个大潮来了
But, Celeste, a swell came in last night.

36

Northwest.

37
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,233
很明显 这浪又大又清
Apparently, it is overhead and it is glassy.

38
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,861
- 你到底在说什么?  - 马里布

00:03:57,029 --> 00:04:00,698
- 那里波浪正涌  - 你在说冲浪? 你竟然在说冲浪
- The waves are crushing right now.  - Are you talking about surfing? You're talking about surfing.

40
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,700
对啊 你为什么不兴奋了?
Yeah. Why are you not more excited?

41
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:05,703
我好激动 刚才我以为是杂志社打来的
I'm so psyched. I just thought that was about that job.

42
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:08,956
- 那个插画工作  - 对 他们没回我电话
- The illustration job.  - Right. They haven't called me back.

43
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:10,750
说实话 我不是很想在那儿工作
Honestly, I'm not dying to work there.

44
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,294
听上去你根本就不想工作
Doesn't seem like you're dying to work at all.

45
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:16,255
我在准备一个展览 你知道要卖出去东西很花时间
I'm putting together a show. I'm going to sell stuff. You know it takes time.

46
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,925
- 我了解  - 那好 现在我可以载你回家了吗?
- I know. I know.  - Okay. Can I drop you off at home now?

47
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,636
- 我刚错过了一道波浪  - 我觉得吧...

48
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,346
- 又一道  - 好吧

50
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,224
- 我本可以激情冲浪的  - 送我回家吧
- I could be on those.  - Take me home.

- 六点钟回来好吗? 这样就还能洗个澡  - 为什么要洗澡?
- Be back by 6 so you can shower?  - Why shower?

52
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,372

谢了
Thank you.

56
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:00,841
结果你们上周去看那个乐队表演了?
Did you guys end up seeing that band last week?

57
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,259
没错 是说草泥马乐队吧?
Oh, yeah. Fuck Your Mom?

58
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,178
- 他们很棒 老兄  - 对
- They were for reals, dude.  - Yeah.

59
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:08,391
可以请他们当你的婚礼乐队 他们很吵不过却很便宜
You should get them as your wedding band. They're loud but probably pretty cheap.

60
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,644
或者帮他们开场的神佑世人乐队也不错
Or the band that opened for them, Please us, Christ. They were good.

61
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,105
- 他们棒极了  - 我告诉过你们 这事儿已经定下来了
- They kind of shredded.  - Guys, It's done. I told you.

62
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,940
我们请到了最好的摇摆乐队
We've already got the greatest swing band in New England.

63
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:18,943
- 糖足和摇摆鱼乐队  - 没有 其实没请
- Sugarfoot and the Swingin' Scrod.  - No, no, no. We actually didn't.

64
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:21,404
我们商量过 摇摆音乐太过时了
We talked about this. Swing is so late 90s.

65
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,573
我们不请摇摆乐队 我们...
We're not gonna do that. We're not doing it. We're not...

66
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,118
我要亲遍你的脸 爱死你了
I'm gonna eat your face, I love you so much.

67
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,621
- 我们等下再说  - 那现在我们看看菜单
- We'll talk about it later.  - And so now we turn to the menu.

68
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:35,501
好 我觉得最好点玉米饼和玉米卷...
Yes, I think the best idea is to get enchiladas and tacos...

69
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,795
然后分着吃?
and then we split the two, ja?

70
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:41,632
这是一个不错的选择 但我还是要反对...
This is a clinical choice, but I must object to your strategy...

71
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,552
因为我想独自享受玉米卷
for I wish to enjoy the tacos alone.

72
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,140
不 这不公平 我就咬一口 不行吗?
No, but that is not fair. As long as I can have some bites, ja?

73
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,642
- 但我们都知道你的"咬一口"是什么意思  - 才没有
- But we know about your bites, don't we?  - No.

74
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,894
你咬完一口 就会接着咬很多口
You take one and then you take many.

75
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,647
- 这是真的  - 哦 就是
- Ja, this is true.  - Ja, you do.

76
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,983
这是真的
This is true.

77
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,406
我们不能再这样下去了
We can't do this anymore.

78
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,160
天啊
Oh, God.

79
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:13,748
亲爱的 婚礼会有压力 但是我向你保证
Honey, weddings are so stressful, but I promise you, we know.

80
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,708
- 你们会很好的  - 很好的
- You guys will be fine.  - Just fine.

81
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:19,003
- 对 我们很好  - 对 我们很好
- Yeah. Oh, yeah, we are fine.  - No, we're good.

82
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:22,465
你们到底在干嘛?
What the fuck are you two doing?

83
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,301
- 什么意思?  - 对 你什么意思?
- What do you mean?  - Yeah. What do you mean?

84
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:27,678
我什么意思? 你们两个不在一起了
What do I mean? You two are not together.

85
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,014
很不正常 好吗?
It's not normal, okay?

86
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,683
你们已经分开六个月了
You guys have been separated for six months.

87
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,102
都要离婚了 知道不?
You're getting divorced, all right?

88
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,315
可是你们两个还每天同进同出 好像根本没离婚这回事
And you spend every day together hanging out as if, like, it's no big deal.

89
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:42,485
- 知道吗 这非常奇怪  - 少说两句吧...
- Guess what. It's fucking weird.  - I don't think this is...

90
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:46,781
- 告诉他们你的感觉  - 我们都别装了 真的好奇怪的
- No. Tell them what you think.  - Let's not play charades. It's weird.

91
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,700
- 我们根本没在装呀  - 没有
- There's no charades being played here.  - No charades.

92
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,327
- 根本没有  - 就是
- No charading.  - No.

93
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:54,914
我们离婚了 但还是朋友 你们应该高兴才对
We are separated, and we're friends. You guys should be happy.

94
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:57,208
以前我们老是吵架 现在都不吵了
We fought all the time. We don't anymore.

95
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,377
你们应该兴奋才对 都不用选边站 这才是完美离婚
You should be thrilled. You don't have to choose sides. It's the perfect breakup.

96
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,712
对 对大家都好
Yeah, everyone's cool.

97
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,714
- 大家都不好  - 不好
- Everyone is not cool.  - Not cool.

98
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:05,966
这里没人好
No one is cool here.

99
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,011
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,722
我实在受不了了 抱歉
I can't do this anymore. I'm sorry.

101
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,183
- 宝贝  - 贝丝
- Baby.  - Beth.

102
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:21,398
- 贝丝很生气  - 嗯 她气疯了
- Beth is so angry.  - Ja, she is buber angry.

103
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,110
这太奇怪了
This is too weird.

104
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,749
嘿 小赛
Hey, C.

105
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:43,379
- 你能帮我个忙吗?  - 什么?
- Can you help me with something?  - What?

106
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,386
我不想给你压力...
Don't wanna pressure you into anything...

107
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:53,222
但这位先生实在是寂寞难耐...

小点声
Wait, be quiet.

113
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,943
我室友就在隔壁 别出声
My roommate's next door. Don't make any sound.

117
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:16,662

120
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:32,720
我是说我们同进同出并不奇怪
I mean, it is not weird that we hang out all the time.

121
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,722
你觉得我们同进同出奇怪吗?
Do you think it's weird we hang out all the time?

Last time we didn't speak for more than a week was in 10th grade...

124
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:43,189
就是你去加拿大太空营的时候

125
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,024
那五个星期好痛苦
That was a brutal five weeks.

126
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,986
那失重体验真的很棒
The antigravity training was crazy, though.

127
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,281
不过我很想你
But I missed you.

128
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,866
我也是
Me too.

129
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,120
看看谁回来了
Look who's back.

130
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:01,040
- 他恢复得很快  - 哦 不
- His recovery time is insane.  - Oh, no.

131
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,375
他是个大学生 准备好再来一发了
He's a college boy and he's ready to rock.

132
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,419
就是这样
Here we go.

133
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:10,424
- 我累死了  - 我也是
- I'm exhausted.  - Yeah, me too.

134
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:13,636
- 甜品很棒 对吧?  - 是很不错
- Dessert was good, right?  - Oh, so good.

135
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,013
- 晚安  - 晚安
- Night.  - Night.

136
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,476
嘿 今天晚上挺冷的 你那边的制热怎么样?
Hey, it's kind of chilly tonight. How's your heat in there?

137
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:24,438
- 很好 没事  - 好 那就好
- It's fine. I'm fine.  - Okay. Good.

138
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:28,984
嘿 很抱歉我还住在这里
Hey, sorry I'm still living back here.

139
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,528
你想住多久就多久 这是你的工作室
Stay as long as you want. It's your studio.

140
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:35,199
- 而且有你在这里真好  - 我也觉得
- Also, it's really nice having you here.  - For me too.

141
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,701
- 晚安  - 晚安 爱你
- Night.  - Night. Love you.

142
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,453
我也爱你
Love you too.

143
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:12,194
- 你是要...?  - 您点的印度拉茶
- Are you gonna...? No.  - Here's your chai latte.

144
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,490
- 能给我杯大杯咖啡吗?  - 大卫先生点了杯大豆卡布奇诺
- Can I get a large coffee to go?  - Soy cappuccino for David.

145
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,786
抱歉 先生
Excuse me, sir? Sir.

146
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,496
先生 对 就是你
Sir. Yeah, you. Sorry.

147
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:26,875
你知道插了很多人的队吗?
You do realize that you just cut in front of a bunch of people, right?

148
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,545
- 我很抱歉 我不知道  - 你不知道?
- I'm so sorry. I didn't know.  - Did you not know?

149
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:32,381
- 我很急 所以...  - 所以你是知道的
- I'm just in a big rush, so...  - So you did know.

150
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:36,635
- 我确定这里排队的人都很急  - 好吧 你真的要跟我争论吗?
- And I'm sure everyone here is in a rush.  - Okay, is this really happening?

151
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:40,014
她在看糕点 所以我想...
She was looking at the pastries, so I just... I thought...

152
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,641
不只是她 是她后面的所有人
It's not just her. It's everyone behind her.

153
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:47,855
如果你想问一下是不是所有人都不介意 请便
If you wanna ask every single person if it's okay that you cut, be my guest.

154
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:51,025
别以为自己的时间比别人的重要
Don't assume your time is more important than others'.

155
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,903
谢谢你的演讲 祝大家今天愉快 除了你
Thank you for the lecture. Have a great day, everybody. Not you.

156
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:02,453
美国文化正在死去 这个国家正在萌生一种无情的喜好...
American culture is dying, and there's an unrelenting appetite in this country...

157
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:07,333
例如真人秀 像赖利・班克斯这样毫无天赋的流行明星...
for reality shows, talentless pop stars like Riley Banks...

158
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,752
以及陈词滥调的系列电影
recycled, bloated movie franchises.

159
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,421
我们越是消费这些废物 就会越想接着消费
The more we consume crap, the more we want crap.

160
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:13,714
人如其食
You are what you eat.

161
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:16,717
听起来毫无希望了 这就是结果吗?
It sounds utterly hopeless. Is there an upshot?

162
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:20,220
我想会有一个大潮流 趋向简约朴素
I think there will be a groundswell movement toward simplicity.

163
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:23,849
人们会渴望精神 心理和身体的营养
People will crave spiritual, mental and physical nourishment.

164
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,602
- 会追求最基础的东西  - 这很值得品味
- It'll be back to basics.  - A lot to chew on.

165
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,355
想要继续探究这个沉重却有趣的话题...
For more on this gloomy but interesting subject...

166
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,441
欢迎购买塞莱斯特・马汀的新书...
look out for Celeste Martin's new book, Shitegeist...

167
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,360
星期一上市
on bookshelves Monday.

168
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,987
- 昨晚我和闹剧二人组吃饭了  - 谁?
- I had dinner with the drama club last night.  - Who's that?

169
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:40,115
贝丝和塔克 他们吃到一半就走了...
Beth and Tucker. They left in the middle of dinner...

170
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:43,369
因为他们不支持我和杰西在一起 你能想象吗?
because they don't approve of me and Jesse hanging out. Can you believe that?

171
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:47,956
我们很好 如果我们是同性恋 就不会有这段对话
It is so judgy. We're fine. If we were gay, we wouldn't be having this conversation.

172
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:52,169
- 我们只是朋友 根本没想这么多  - 你们还没准备让对方离开
- We'd just be friends. We don't even think about it.  - You are not ready to let go of each other.

173
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:55,881
- 这完全没错呀  - 的确没错
- There's nothing wrong with that.  - There's nothing wrong with it.

174
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,676
- 我在问你的想法  - 老实说吧...
- I mean, what do you think?  - Well, to be honest...

175
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,887
天啊 我们要签下赖利・班克斯?
Oh, my God. We're signing Riley Banks?

176
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:06,058
怎么回事 斯科特? 我刚才还在电视上说她是垃圾
What the fuck, Scott? I just trashed her on TV.

177
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:09,144
这就是我把你叫到办公室的原因 这是件大事
That's why I wanted you to come in. It's a huge account.

178
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:13,190
我们组建公司 就是为了不要去签像赖利・班克斯这样的人
We built this company so we didn't have to sign accounts like Riley Banks.

179
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:16,735
如果不签赖利・班克斯 这公司就可能会倒闭
You and I may not have a company if we don't take Riley Banks.

180
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,655
我不明白 她就只有绯闻和难看发型而已
I don't understand. She's like a vagina and a hairdo.

181
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,156
她要发行一张新专辑了
She's releasing a new CD.

182
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:23,992
她想要我们公司发行和推广
She wants us to do the branding and merchandising.

183
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,665
好吧 我去把意见往肚子里吞
Fine. I'm gonna go eat my feelings.

184
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:33,001
如果你想要我的意见 我的确认为你该去约约会
If you want my opinion, I do think you should start dating.

185
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:37,089
斯科特 我没事 我时间很多 所以不担心
Scott, I'm fine. I have so much time. I'm not worried.

186
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:40,634
帮我一个忙 你换对象之前 可千万别乱搞
Do me a favor and get your fuck on before you meet the next guy.

187
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,595
这算什么? 你在做什么?
What is that? What are you doing?

188
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:47,599
抱歉 我想假装是你可爱的同志朋友
Sorry. I was trying to be your saucy gay friend.

189
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:51,311
- 感觉不太好  - 不 别这样
- Didn't feel good.  - No. Don't.

190
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,523
经济状况真是不好 老兄
The economic climate is real bad, man.

191
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,443
我觉得自己的生意从没这么艰难过
I think my business is taking the hardest hit of all.

192
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,612
这很残酷 是只有我生意凄惨还是都没人开口?
It's brutal. Is it just me or is nobody talking about it?

193
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,073
- 你可是买烟草的 斯基尔斯  - 现在不是了
- You sell weed, Skillz.  - Not for long, dude.

194
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:06,326
你看到满地都是烟草店了吗?
You seen those weed pharmacies on every fucking corner?

195
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,870
他们要把我杀死了
They're killing me.

196
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:12,499
我是说 我在想改行 卖点冰毒
I mean, I think I gotta branch out, start working in methamphetamines.

197
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,168
或者去教幼儿园 知道不?
Or teach preschool, you know?

198
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:17,671
我喜欢孩子 而且我一直都想去教幼儿园
I love kids, and I just, I don't know, always wanted to do that.

199
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,548
抱歉 兄弟
Sorry, dude.

200
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:23,844
我知道这是很严肃的话题 但看看那姑娘的屁屁
I know this is serious talky time, but look at the fucking seat on that girl.

201
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:27,848
- 还真是翘啊  - 还没结束
- That is a party.  - I don't think it's over.

202
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:31,477
- 什么? 她的屁股? 不 它永远都在  - 不 兄弟 是说我和塞莱斯特
- What? Her butt? No, it goes on forever.  - No, man. Me and Celeste.

203
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:35,189
她有压力还很困惑 但是我想她开始接受了
She's overwhelmed and confused, but I think she's gonna come around.

204
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,648
不是吧 兄弟?
Oh, no. Really, pal?

205
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,817
我是说已经有段时间了...
I mean, it's been a while, you know...

206
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,695
但是时候看清现实 继续生活了
but I think it's time to accept that and move on.

207
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:45,157
- 对吧? 给维罗妮卡打电话  - 不 哥们 这不是一夜情
- Right? Call that dime Veronica.  - No, dude. That was a one-time thing.

208
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,910
塞莱斯特还不知道这件事 别告诉她
Celeste does not know about it, so don't tell her.

209
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:52,247
我不知道还要敌进我退 好像你没那么喜欢她...
I didn't know that was a hit-and-run. It's not like you really liked her, so...

210
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,333
她很好 不过她不是塞莱斯特
She was cool, but she's not Celeste.

211
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,960
但你要记住 不能脚踏两条船
Okay, but remember, you can't reheat a souffle.

212
00:13:57,128 --> 00:14:00,214
- 什么意思?  - 这里是洛杉矶 到处是美女
- What does that mean?  - It's L.A. There's bettys everywhere.

213
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:03,217
的确得提醒一下塞莱斯特 你还是很有吸引力的 对吧?
It's good to remind Celeste you can pull a little wool, right?

214
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,344
- 让她紧张一下  - 对
- Make her sweat a bit.  - Yeah, I guess.

215
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:06,553
- 你还好吗?  - 非常好
- How are you?  - Good.

216
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:10,265
- 那你想怎么样?  - 我不想重新开始
- So, what do you want, man?  - Maybe I just don't wanna start over.

217
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:14,228
不 我是问你想要吃什么? 酸奶怎么样?
No, I meant, like, what do you want? Do you want yogurt?

218
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:18,899
我要枸杞绿茶加酸奶薯条和麦片
Can I have a goji-berry-and-green-tea swirl with yogurt chips and Cap'n Crunch?

219
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,318
- 你想和我朋友出去玩吗?  - 别这样
- Would you go out with my friend ever?  - No.

220
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:24,488
你老婆在哪? 你们两个每天都一起来这里
Where's your wife? You guys are here every day together.

221
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:27,783
- 我和老婆离婚了  - 哦 好的
- We're actually separated.  - Oh, cool.

222
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:30,577
我是说 不管怎么样 我答应了
I mean, bummer or whatever, but, okay, I'll go.

223
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:32,538
就是这样
Just like that.

224
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,914
好极了
Cool.

225
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:36,667
你想把料搅进去还是放在一边?
You want it swirled or side by side?

226
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,176
- 怎么了?  - 我要说一件事
- What?  - I need to say one thing.

227
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,679
以后我就不会再说了
Then I'm not gonna say another word about it.

228
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:53,141
我很抱歉那天在晚餐时发火 可是我认为你们不在一起是很愚蠢的
I'm sorry I wigged on you at dinner. But I think it's stupid you're not together.

229
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,978
我知道 你们是好朋友
I do. You guys are best friends.

230
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,438
这就是重点 其它事情都没关系
That's the hard part. Nothing else matters.

231
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,232
贝丝 我深爱着杰西...
Beth, I love Jesse dearly...

232
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,527
但是他既没存款 也没像样的衣服
but he doesn't have a checking account or dress shoes.

233
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:07,406
我孩子的父亲要有车 知道吗?
The father of my children will have a car. You know?

234
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,866
杰西会一直是我的好朋友
Jesse will always be my best friend.

235
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,827
好吧 我说了我该说的
Okay. I said what I had to say.

236
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:14,871
以后不会再说了 我只是必须要说出来
Not gonna say another word. I just needed to say that.

237
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,085
他住在客房就是个大错误
It's a huge mistake that he's living in that guesthouse.

238
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:25,465
- 塞莱斯特 你这是在煎熬他的心  - 杰西没事
- Celeste, you are breaking his heart, slowly.  - Jesse is fine.

239
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,301
他很好
He's fine.

240
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:37,644
嘿
Hey.

241
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,605
你不工作?
You're not working?

242
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:44,192
又在看北京奥运会?
You're watching the Beijing Olympics again?

243
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,695
而且又哭了
And you're crying again.

244
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:49,740
马赛厄斯的老婆去年出车祸死了
Matthias' wife died in a car accident last year.

245
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,952
嘿 你完成流行论坛的艺术画了吗?
Hey, did you finish that artwork for the Pop Formm website yet?

246
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,705
没 还没完成 我还在画
No, it's not done yet. I'm still working on it.

247
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,875
- 我想你会喜欢的  - 今晚能完成吗?
- I think you're gonna like it.  - Can you finish it tonight?

248
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,546
不 实际上...
No. Actually...

249
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:08,342
坐下来 我要告诉你一些重要的事
sit down for one second. I wanna tell you something important.

250
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,635
好
Okay.

251
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,721
如果是你欠我工作的事...
Does it have something to do with the work you owe me...

252
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:15,432
现在才谈是不是有点晚了?
that's late that we were just talking about?

253
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,646
今晚我要去约会
Tonight I am going on a date.

254
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:24,608
和别人约会
And I'm gonna date people.

255
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,861
很好啊
That's great.

256
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,322
- 是吗?  - 嗯
- It is?  - Yeah.

257
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,700
杰西 别哭了 真为你高兴
No, Jess. Please don't cry again. Good for you.

258
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:40,207
- 你不困扰吗?  - 不
- Doesn't bother you?  - No.

259
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:44,211
好吧 是个酸奶店的服务员
Okay. Yeah, it's yogurt girl from Yogurt Yurt.

260
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:47,839
那个酸奶妹很可爱
Yogurt girl. Yeah, she's cute.

261
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,842
- 她很年轻 对吧?  - 非常年轻
- She's really young, right?  - Super young, yeah.

262
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:55,138
- 但她的身材就一般了  - 好吧 没必要这样 但是...
- But her body is, like, all-time.  - Okay, there's no need for that, but...

263
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,349
哇 那很好啊 真的很好
Wow, that's great. That's really great.

264
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,935
那就好 找下个老婆前就该约约会
This is good. You gotta crawl before you walk.

265
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:02,896
虽然她不会是你下一任老婆 但无所谓了
She's not gonna be wife number two, but whatever.

266
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,148
不 这只是个约会
No. It's just a date.

267
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,068
嘿 大进展
Hey. Big move.

268
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,320
我为你自豪
I'm proud of you.

269
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:13,407
- 谢了  - 我能起来了吗?
- Thank you.  - Can I get up now?

270
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,700
- 可以  - 好
- Oh, yeah.  - Okay.

271
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,953
约会顺利 以后再联系
You're gonna be great. Call me after.

272
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,413
不
No.

273
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:23,083
我当年还在念书 但我辍学了 因为我太想在时尚圈工作了
I was in school, but I dropped out because I really wanna work in fashion.

274
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,711
但真的很难找一个带薪实习的工作
But it's really hard to find a paid internship.

275
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,797
所以我回到学校 然后现在在酸奶店工作
So I went back to school, and now I work at Yogurt Yurt.

276
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:31,508
赚钱做我喜欢的事
I'm looking to make money doing something I love.

277
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:33,468
我确定世界都会支持我
I'm sure the universe has my back.

278
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,804
好的事情总会来的 知道吗?
The right thing will come along, you know?

279
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:40,308
- 很明显你明白了 对吗?  - 完全明白
- I mean, you get it, obviously, right?  - Totally.

280
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,440
天啊
Oh, my God.

281
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,446
天啊 杰西
Oh, my God, Jesse.

282
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:21,099
"在我脸上做"?
"Do It on My Face"?

283
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,811
这首歌是关于怎么做自己的
This song is about being who you are.

284
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:27,647
除非你很逊
Unless who you are sucks.

285
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,941
所有人闭嘴
Everybody shut up.

286
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:50,045
他们说会在最新上架的地方
They said it would be in new releases.

287
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,673
在哪呢?
Where is it?

288
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,345
没有
No.

289
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,396
这就是我说的陈列问题
Now, that's what I call placement.

290
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,570
即使是你的书 你也不能偷
You shouldn't steal it, even if it is your book.

291
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:18,073
我只是要重新换个位置
I'm just rearranging some things.

292
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,537
- 好了  - 你不能这样做
- There.  - You can't do that.

293
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,872
- 我可以  - 书店的人没有选你的书
- Yes, I can.  - An employee didn't pick you.

294
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,457
没关系
Doesn't matter.

295
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,293
嘿 书店选了你的书
Hey. Employee picks.

296
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:32,587
- 恭喜了 酷毙了  - 谢了
- Congrats. That's awesome.  - Thanks.

297
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:35,674
- 怎么了?  - 书店选了她的书
- What happened?  - Employee picks.

298
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,719
杰西?
Jesse?

299
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:42,514
- 嘿  - 维罗妮卡

- You look great.  - Thanks. You too.

306
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,611
你在这干嘛?
What are you doing here?

307
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,739
找几本书
Checking out books.

308
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,284
- 我也是  - 嗯
- Same.  - Yep.

309
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,287
你的晾衣夹插画画得怎么样了?
How's your clothespin collage going?

310
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:07,956
你还记得那个
You remember that.

311
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,542
很好 虽然速度慢 但很顺利
It's good. It's good. Slow but good.

312
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,421
呃 别放弃 因为那很特别 也很漂亮
Well, don't give it up, because it's really unique and beautiful.

313
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:19,050
- 我希望听起来没那么...  - 不 不 很谢谢你这么说...
- I hope that didn't sound too...  - No, no. That's really sweet and...

314
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,386
- 好吧  - 对我意义颇深 谢了
- Good.  - Yeah, that means a lot. Thank you.

315
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,680
不客气
You're welcome.

316
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:27,142
那晚我和你玩得很开心 很抱歉没有打电话给你
I had so much fun with you that night. I'm sorry I didn't call.

317
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,561
我也很开心
I had a lot of fun too.

318
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,605

319
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:33,440
- 嘿  - 嗨

321
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,611

You wrote that book.

327
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,080
我在网上看了它的摘要 很吸引人

334
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:04,638
维罗妮卡
Veronica.

335
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,056
- 什么情况?  - 没什么
- Story?  - No story.

336
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,391
只是我前段时间认识的女孩儿罢了
Just a girl I met a little while ago.

337
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,187
她挺漂亮的 像年轻时的我
She's pretty. She looks like a young me.

338
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:13,939
打扰一下 嗨
Excuse me. Hi.

339
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,942
我想送几本Shitegeist给朋友...
Do you have any more copies of this book Shitegeist...

340
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,445
你们还有多的吗? 听说这书相当不错呢
for me to give to my friends? Because I heard it's excellent.

341
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:35,043
- 别接 别接  - 稍等一会儿 喂
- No, no.  - Just one second. Hey.

342
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:37,212
- 刚看完表演  - 怎么样?
- Just got out of the show.  - How was it?

343
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,506
- 简直酷毙了  - 你现在忙吗?
- Fucking dope.  - Hey, are you busy now?

344
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:42,509
- 不 我不忙  - 能过来帮我装一下梳妆台吗?
- No, I'm not busy.  - Can you help me build this dresser?

345
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:44,094
- 好  - 我一个人装不了
- Okay.  - I can't do it alone.

346
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:47,013
- 好吧 我马上过去 拜  - 杰西 我需要你
- All right, all right. Okay, bye.  - Jesse, I need you.

347
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:48,223
伙计 我得回家了
Dude, I gotta go home.

348
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:50,350
表演完了有余兴派对
After the show, it's the after-party.

349
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:54,270
我知道 但是她买了个宜家的梳妆台 需要我帮她"装一下"
I know, but she's got an IKEA dresser she needs me to help her "build."

350
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,522
哦 真是这样?
Oh, it's like that?

351
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:58,608
我跟你说过 她只是需要更多的时间来适应
I told you, man, she just needed a little bit more time.

352
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:00,986
- 我明白的  - 喔 她很快就会懂了
- I got this.  - Oh, she's about to get it.

353
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,406
我在这儿 该死的瑞典人(宜家是瑞典公司)
I'm in here. Fuck Sweden.

354
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,784
怎样了?
What up?

355
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:12,998
- 造布鲁克林大桥也比这个容易  - 没问题 就是个梳妆台而已
- It's easier to build the Brooklyn Bridge.  - We got this. It's just a dresser.

356
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,333
真该死 我靠!
Fucking fuck. Fuck me!

357
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:21,506
难道他们故意造了一件组装不好的家具...
What, do they make a piece of furniture that's impossible to build on purpose...

358
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,800
专门跟你作对?
just to fuck with you?

359
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,011
谢谢夸奖
Thank you.

360
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,223
等等
Wait.

361
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,600
我知道了
I've got it.

362
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:39,816
- 太完美了  - 完美的接合
- Perfect.  - Fucking layup.

363
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:46,614
就像孔思风格加上巴斯奎特涂鸦风...
It's like Koons meets Basquiat meets...

364
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:50,326
再加上塞拉...
Serra meets...

365
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:53,872
和"春风吹又生"里的科尔奇风
Corky from Life Goes On.

366
00:22:56,834 --> 00:23:01,046
- 他是素食者  - 哦 珍惜吧
- He's a vegan, you know.  - Oh, cherish.

367
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:05,383
- 太可爱了  - 你才可爱
- That is so cute.  - You're cute.

368
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,303
你才可爱
You're cute.

369
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:54,015
你在干什么?
Hey. What are you doing?

370
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,142
我爱你
I love you.

371
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,478
好了
Okay.

372
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:13,159
真是个馊主意 对不起
That was a bad idea. So sorry.

373
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:16,871
不 别抱歉 这很好
No, don't be sorry. It was nice.

374
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,791
杰西
Jess.

375
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,417
行了
Come on.

376
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:24,838
我们喝醉了 那个梳妆台...
Drinking and the dresser and....

377
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,882
我想 你懂的... 我们都在跟别人约会
I think, you know.... We're seeing other people.

378
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:31,302
是 但那都是因为...
Well, yeah, but just because....

379
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,311
天啊

- My acupuncturist said that's a myth.  - No. I think that...

00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:20,766
我觉得你可以多用点时间来走出离婚的阴影
I think you could use a little more time to get over your divorce.

525
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:25,146
我也是离婚后很长一段时间才开始约会的 我很理解
I mean, look, it took me a long time to start dating after mine. I get it.

谢谢你的关心 我很好
I appreciate your concern, but I'm fine.

527

- 好像有12英里?  - 13.6英里
- Isn't that like 12 miles?  - Thirteen-point-six.

537
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:33,255
跑步很好啊 可以帮我增加脑内啡的释放
But it's good because it just, like, really gets my endorphins up.

538
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:35,591
让我的脑袋更清醒
It helps me clear my head.

539
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:39,678
赖利的单子真棘手 我快崩溃了
The Riley account is a handful. I have been so swamped.

Good. I'm glad you've been so busy. Have you spoken to Jesse?

541
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:47,394
碰到过他一次 我觉得他好像胖了
I actually ran into him, and I thought he was actually looking a little fat.

542
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:51,190
是吗? 我怎么觉得看到他的时候他更健壮了
Really? I feel like when I saw him, he was looking kind of fit.

543
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:54,985
- 所以你也见过杰西?  - 是啊 是的 我见过他
- So you saw Jesse?  - Yeah. Yeah, I have. I've seen him.

544
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,947
所以你也跟那个叫什么名字的出去了?
And you've hung out with what's-her-name?

545
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,490
维罗妮卡? 是的
Veronica? Yes, I have.

546
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:03,869
- 可以寄急件吗?  - 她很蠢 是吧?
- Can I get a rush delivery on that?  - She's dumb, right?

547
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:07,540
不啊 她不蠢 她... 挺简单的
No, she's not dumb. She's... She's simple.

548
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:10,167
上午7点到晚上9点可以吗?
Does 7 A.M. to 9 P.M. work as a window for you?

549
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:11,794
简单就是愚蠢嘛
Simple means dumb, though.

550
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:15,548
真的不是 简单得很优雅
No, actually. Simple in a really elegant way.

551
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,299
优雅
Elegant.

552
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:20,594

- 我以为你会为杰西高兴  - 哦 当然了 我很高兴啊
- I thought you would be happy for Jesse.  - Oh, no, I totally am.

554
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:27,643
我只是看不出来那个莫妮卡哪里优雅了
I just didn't realize that Monica was elegant.

555
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:32,273
你知道她叫维罗妮卡 说实话 亲爱的 你会喜欢她的
You know her name's Veronica. And honestly, honey, you'd really like her.

556
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,150
拜托 别这样
Okay, don't do that.

557
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:39,488
你后悔离开杰西了吗?
Are you having regrets about Jesse?

558
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:42,658
什么? 没有啊 一点都没有
What? No. Not one.

559
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:45,744
我送你回家吧? 我怕你被汗淹死了
Will you let me drive you home? I'm afraid you'll drown.

560
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:49,874

564
00:36:58,592 --> 00:37:02,845

Oh, my God. He's so hot. But he's like 11 years old.

- Oh, fuck, I love that movie.  - I know.

569
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:15,441
# 一颗星辰划过天幕 #
# A star fell from the sky #

570
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:17,401
# 看着你 我突然醒悟 #
# Look at you and I realize #

571
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,615
# 这就是你在起舞 #

In thinking about your new brand, we wanted a sense of where you currently exist.

为此我们要在全国范围内设立重点行销区域
We set up a number of focus groups throughout the country.

I mean, where are the guys who don't wear makeup for a living?

617
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:20,000
能不能有点智慧? 智商高点儿又不会死人
How about a little intellect? Intellect never hurt anybody.

618
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:22,920
- 等等 你没见过尼克 对吧?  - 尼克?

00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:48,570
你要再努力一点才能成为基佬 斯科特
You gotta work a little harder to integrate the gayness, Scott.

626

- 宝贝背带是什么玩意儿?  - 是一个非常非常袖珍的瑞典男人
- What the fuck is a BabyBjorn?  - It's a very, very tiny Swedish man.

632
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:11,385
是一种婴儿背带 能让父母跟宝宝更加亲密...
It's actually a child carrier that allows the baby to benefit from intimacy...

633
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:13,720
而不是只用婴儿车
without the confinement of a stroller.

634
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,681
- 你怎么知道的?  - 贝丝说的
- How do you know that?  - Beth.

635
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:18,100
没错 我们参加过无数次迎婴派对
Yeah, we go to a lot of baby showers.

636
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:20,185
而我帮好多女士有了宝宝
I put a lot of babies in the ladies.

637
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:21,979
- 塞莱斯特最近怎么样?  - 谁?
- How's Celeste?  - Who?

638
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:23,522
- 塞莱斯特  - 她还行
- Celeste.  - She's all right.

639
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:27,860
我改良了她对大麻的接受程度 她不错
I'm kind of fine-tuning her cannabis levels right now, but she's okay.

640
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:31,238
- 她不抽大麻  - 现在抽了 爱不释手
- She doesn't smoke weed.  - She does now. She loves that shit.

641
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:33,699
史诺普・道格的歌听多了吧
Fucking Snoop Dogg.

642
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:39,872
婴儿毛巾 抽乳器 尿布? 我去
Birthing towel, breast pump, diaper genie? Fuck.

- 我真的要有个宝宝了  - 你会很棒的
- I'm seriously having a baby.  - You'll do great, man.

644
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:48,172
嘿 斯基尔斯 你那位朋友是谁?
Hey, Skillz. Who's your buddy?

645
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:51,508
我不知道 我以为那是你们的朋友
I don't know. I thought he was your friend.

646
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:52,801
- 不是我的  - 真假?
- Not with me.  - Really?

647
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:54,178
我不认识他
I don't know him.

648
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:01,560
我等了估计有21个小时 三个都被我尿湿了
I waited like 21 hours, three of them soaked in my own pee.

649
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:05,314
- 哦 天呐  - 但是我最终还是拍到卡扎菲了
- Oh, my God.  - But I finally got the shot of Gaddafi.

650
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,316
天呐 我绝对见过这张
My God, I've totally seen this one.

651
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,026
- 你见过了?  - 是啊
- You've seen it?  - Yeah.

652

- I'm such a big fan. That's so cool.  - Thank you.

653
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:15,991
- 我觉得他还在笑  - 没错
- I feel like he's kind of smiling.  - He is.

654
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:21,413
我觉得是我牛仔裤上那摊尿渍逗他笑的
I mean, I think the piss stain running down my jeans made him laugh.

655
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:22,831
真的 那天全湿了
Seriously, I was soaked.

656
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:27,044
全世界都以为你聪明过人 只有我才知道真相是什么
The world will think you're brilliant. I'll be the only one who knows.

657
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:28,462
怎么了?
What?

658
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:31,048
- 我在餐厅预订了8点半的座位 现在晚了  - 不是吧
- We missed our reservation for 8:30.  - Oh, no.

659
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:34,134
你想让我恳求他们 让我们进去吗?
You want me to call down, see if they can still take us?

660
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:35,928
我该怎么说呢... ?
Should I just, like...?

661
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:38,764
我们9点或者9点一刻的时候能进去吗?
You guys still take us for like 9, 9:15?

662
00:42:38,932 --> 00:42:41,934
- 我觉得没有人会...  - 行吗?
- I don't think anybody...  - Is that cool?

663
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,769
- 不行吗?  - 是可以
- You can't do that?  - You can.

664
00:42:43,937 --> 00:42:46,104
但我觉得没人会听你的
I just don't think anybody will hear you.

665
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:49,733
你知道吗? 如果直接叫外卖的话...
You know what? I actually would be cool...

666
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,652
我也没有问题

667
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,403
- 外卖?  - 没错

668
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,155
好啊 叫外卖我没意见
Okay. I could do room service.

669
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:57,532
- 好吧  - 我喜欢叫外卖
- Cool.  - That sounds good. I like that.

670
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:01,620
我很高兴能聊的这么开心 认识你很高兴
I'm so happy this worked out. It's so nice to meet you.

671
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,757
我都忘了上次有这种感觉是什么时候了
Can't remember the last time I felt like this.

672
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,927
没错
Yes.

673
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:29,648
- 你在干吗?  - 你觉得我在干吗?
- What are you doing?  - What do you think I'm doing?

674
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:34,903
不 不 不 不要这样 刚才还很顺的
No, no, no. Don't do that. Things were going so well.

675
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:37,447
- 我想让你看着我  - 我不要看你
- I want you to watch me.  - There's no watching.

676
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,575
- 我快了  - 快什么了? 不要 不 我不能...
- I'm almost there.  - Where? Don't. No. I can't...

677
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,744
马上了

素食餐厅是个什么鬼地方?

684
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,658

00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:17,464
呃 我知道整件事情都很怪
Well, I know all this has been really weird.

703
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:20,092
只有你觉得怪的时候才怪
It's only weird if you think it's weird.

704
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:22,386
好吧
Okay.

705
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:26,973
很显然你一直没在离婚协议上签字...
There's apparently a holdup on the divorce papers on your end...

706
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:30,602
而维罗妮卡不是美国人 所以...
and Veronica's actually not a citizen, so...

707

Well, I've been busy with work, because some of us work for a living...

714
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:58,463
所以很抱歉我没时间帮你搞好你的新生活
so I'm sorry I haven't had time to focus on helping you get on with your new life.

715
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:00,132
我知道 我也不愿意总是找你
I know. I'm sorry.

716
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:05,387
你怎么会认为自己适合当爸爸?
What makes you think you're suitable to be a dad, even?

717
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:09,015
- 我们从来没聊过要孩子  - 你对孩子的问题总是有所保留
- We never talked about kids.  - You had reservations about kids.

718
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:12,310
- 我是在和你要孩子上有所保留  - 是 彼此彼此
- I had reservations about kids with you.  - Yeah, well, ditto.

我觉得维罗妮卡会是一个很棒的妈妈
I think Veronica's gonna be an amazing mother.

722
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:23,321
而你很可笑 这个餐厅也很可笑
You're ridiculous. This place is ridiculous.

723
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:26,199
什么腰果-素食-海带乱七八糟的
Fucking cashew-vegan-kelp bullshit.

724
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,414
杰西居然是素食主义者?

怎么会有人理解他那些作品... ?
How does anybody even know about his art... ?

729
00:46:40,465 --> 00:46:42,883
你知道吗? 我一点都不想知道
You know what? I don't wanna know anything.

730
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,177
天呐 他现在太火了
My God, he's on fire right now.

731
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:48,013
和我分手是他做过的最正确的事情
Breaking up with me was the best thing he ever did.

732
00:46:48,181 --> 00:46:50,140
- 我也该和自己分手  - 哦 别这样说
- I should break up with me.  - Oh, stop.

733
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:52,893
别人的成功不等于你的失败啊
Somebody else's success does not mean your demise.

734
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,352
除了杰西

- I haven't seen you there in a while.  - I know. I've been running a lot.

758

- 因为跑步对塑形很有用  - 看出来对你起作用了
- It really helps you keep in better shape.  - I can see that's important to you.

- 你扮的谁?  - 我很显然是麦片杀手
- What are you?  - I'm a cereal killer, obviously.

762
00:48:12,682 --> 00:48:14,266
嘿 你说的没错
Hey, you were right.

763
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:17,102
- 什么意思?  - 你说我的事说对了
- What do you mean?  - You were right about me.

764
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:20,313
关于车 手机...
The car, the phone...

765
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:21,523
还有瑜伽
the yoga.

766
00:48:21,691 --> 00:48:24,693
除了我读的常春藤学院不对 我上的是康奈尔大学
Except I went to an Ivy League school. I went to Cornell.

Barely.

770

Let's go. Me too.

772
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:42,961
很抱歉那天在瑜伽馆的事 我每次练完瑜伽都觉得很开放
I'm sorry for that day at the studio. I just feel really open after yoga.

773
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:46,089
别说"开放" 别这样说
Don't say "open." No.

774
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:48,717
你的今天的打扮太棒了 你打算毁了它吗
Your costume is so great. You're gonna ruin it.

775
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:51,511
我开玩笑的 你知道我为什么练瑜伽吗?
I'm kidding. You know why I go to yoga?

776
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:54,431
我练瑜伽是为了认识女孩
I go to yoga to meet girls.

777
00:48:55,016 --> 00:48:56,266
- 这个我信  - 你信?
- I believe that.  - You do?

778
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:57,809
嗯
Yeah.

779
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:03,857
说到这了 咱俩到底什么关系? 我是说 我们之间...?
Speaking of, what's the deal with you and me? I mean, are we...?

780
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:08,737
是彼此喜欢吗还是有别的问题?
Is it happening or what?

781
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:10,655
嗯 你和我之间的问题...
Well, the deal with you and me...

782
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:13,825
是我结婚六年的老公想要离婚...
is that my husband of six years wants a divorce...

783
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:18,580
因为他想和一个怀了他孩子的女人结婚
because he wants to marry the woman who's carrying his child.

784
00:49:18,748 --> 00:49:21,416
这就是我们之间的问题
That's the deal with you and me.

785
00:49:21,751 --> 00:49:23,418
听起来很难解决啊
Sounds tough.

786
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:25,754
他几乎不了解她
He barely knows her.

787
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:28,798
他只是迷失了...
He's just lost...

788
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:34,721
但他要把所有事都一起搞砸
and he's just going about everything so wrong.

789
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:37,349
你说的没错
And you're right.

790
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:39,934
准备怎么办?
Now what?

791
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,855
什么意思?
What does that mean?

792
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:46,941
我的意思是 你是想要做正确的 还是想要做快乐的?
I mean, do you wanna be right, or do you wanna be happy?

793
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:51,279
行了 听着 瑜伽男 我不想管对错 因为我就是对的那个 明白?
Okay, listen, Yoga, I don't wanna be right. I know I'm right, okay?

794
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:55,617
总有人会让你失望 我接受这个事实
People will let you down. I have accepted that fact.

795
00:49:55,785 --> 00:49:58,244
但是既然知道了这些...
But knowing that...

796
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:02,123
就很难快乐起来
makes it impossible to be happy.

797
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:03,958
但至少这是真实的
But at least it's fucking real.

798
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:08,630
从来没人能穿这个垃圾袋还说出处这么一堆...
No one has ever given a more self-righteous monologue...

799
00:50:08,798 --> 00:50:11,341
- 自以为是的独白  - 快闭嘴吧
- wearing a trash bag.  - Shut up.

800
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:14,219
好了 醉鬼 该回家了

00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,351
- 你还想再来一杯吗?  - 多来几杯吧

806
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:23,269

You're gonna be a really good dad.

810
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:44,476
怎么会想这么说?
What made you say that?

811
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:49,063
我也不知道 就是知道你会是
I don't know. I just know it.

812
00:51:56,655 --> 00:52:02,160
对于一个自由艺术家和他的比利时新娘来说真是够奢侈
Well, that's an extravagant purchase for a freelance artist and his Belgian bride.

813
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:11,753
我靠
Shit.

814

He's trying, but it's not all rainbows and unicorns over there, you know?

848
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,376
- 所以他们不快乐?  - 不 我可没这么说

Good crowd? Like your grandma? Where are we?

881
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,264
这是什么?
What is this?

882
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:53,808
这是她第一次来这
This is her first time here.

883
00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:55,601
来吧
Check it out.

884
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:02,275
哦 天呐
Oh, my God.

885
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:09,365
- 这里太棒了  - 你看起来很吃惊啊
- This place is really cool.  - You sound surprised.

886
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:12,326
我是吃惊 你可是住西木区的人
I am surprised. You live in Westwood.

887
00:56:15,831 --> 00:56:18,374
- 想喝点什么?  - 啤酒?
- What do you want to drink?  - Beer?

888
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:19,876

889
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:23,546
你好啊 老兄?
How you doing, man?

890
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:26,674
嗨 宝贝儿 给我来两瓶啤酒
Hi, sweetheart. Can I get two beers?

891
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:31,012
别烫着自己了 老天
Don't burn yourself. Jesus.

892
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:33,806
- 谢谢  - 谢谢
- Thank you.  - Thanks.

893
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:36,184
- 干杯  - 干杯
- Cheers.  - Cheers.

894
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,272
这地方真不错
This is quite a spot.

895
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:46,611
哦 不
Oh, no.

896
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:51,574
- 你喜欢跳舞吗?  - 嗯 我猜你也喜欢
- You like to dance?  - Yeah. Guess you do too.

897
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:54,285
- 你跳的很好  - 哦 你也不赖
- You're good.  - Oh, you're good.

898
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,307
这是什么意思?
What was that for?

899
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:20,770
超脱的意思 老兄 不去试图掌控一切
Vairagya, bro. Don't try to control everything.

900
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:34,909
- 我很喜欢那个封面  - 哦 很好 没错我也觉得很漂亮
- I really like the logo.  - Oh, good. Yeah, I think it's perfect.

901
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:37,578
是啊 波普艺术的影响太广泛了
Yeah, the Keith Haring influence is pretty cool.

902
00:57:37,746 --> 00:57:40,081
是啊 的确是小有影响
Yeah, there is a little bit of that going on.

903
00:57:40,249 --> 00:57:42,542
- 你在嘲笑我吗?  - 没有啊 我只是...
- Are you mocking me?  - No, I just...

904
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,503
你对艺术的了解让我印象深刻
I'm impressed that you know about art.

905
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:48,673
为什么? 因为我是流行歌手还是因为我是家庭教育长大的?
Why? Because I'm a pop star or because I was homeschooled?

906
00:57:48,841 --> 00:57:51,634
随便你怎么想 但是你知道你的问题在哪吗?
Whatever. Do you know what your problem is?

907
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:55,805
- 妄下定论  - 你说什么?
- Contempt prior to investigation.  - I'm sorry?

908
00:57:55,973 --> 00:58:01,102
你自以为比别人都聪明 这就是你的黑暗面
You think you're smarter than everybody, and that is your dark little prison.

909
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:02,436
鞋子很漂亮
Nice shoes.

910
00:58:05,941 --> 00:58:08,317
黑暗面?
Dark little prison?

911
00:58:09,153 --> 00:58:11,320
你不了解我的人生 不知道我是谁
You don't know my life. You don't know me.

912
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:15,616
你懂什么叫黑暗面 黑暗面就是只靠穿着露脐装维持生计
You know what's a dark little prison is having to wear midriffs for a living.

913
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:18,411
那才是黑暗面 省省吧
That's a dark little prison. Give me a break.

914
00:58:18,579 --> 00:58:20,538
这才是我要说的
That's what I'm talking about.

915
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,625
我操啊
What the fuck?

916
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:37,305
- 我又开始抽烟了  - 看出来了
- I started smoking again.  - Yeah, I can see that.

917
00:58:40,893 --> 00:58:44,812
我不知道你有哪些底线 但我敢肯定我在打破它们...
I don't know what the rules are, and I'm sure I'm breaking them...

918
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:48,441
但是我真的想你了
but I really miss you.

919
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,740
你想进来吗?
Do you wanna come in?

920
00:58:55,908 --> 00:58:59,952
维罗妮卡和画廊里的助理是好朋友
Veronica's actually pretty good friends with the assistant gallerist there...

921
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,371
他很喜欢我的作品 所以...
and he really liked my stuff, so....

922
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:06,125
- 我也不知道 走着瞧吧  - 杰西 这很好啊
- I don't know, we'll see.  - Jess, that's so great.

923
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:09,295
- 我很替你开心啊 -是啊
- I'm so happy for you.  - Yeah.

924
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:12,840
是啊 太棒了
Yeah, it's great.

925
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:23,935
- 我应该回家了  - 是啊
- I should probably get home.  - Yeah.

926
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:27,021
很高兴见到你
It's really nice to see you.

927
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:10,022
你该走了
You should go.

928
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:18,406
我们能在这稍微躺一会儿吗?
Can't we just lie here a little bit?

929
01:00:42,723 --> 01:00:47,143
真不敢相信我有了孩子 却不是和你的
Can't believe I'm having a baby and it's not with you.

930
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:06,996
喂?
Yeah?

931
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:09,915
嘿 我们出了个大问题
Hey, we have a massive problem on our hands.

932
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:13,461
我不... 我不明白什么意思
I don't... I don't see anything.

933
01:01:16,465 --> 01:01:18,883
这是爆菊啊
It's a penis and a butt.

934
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:22,595
什么? 不是吧 我没... 我看不出来啊
Really? No, I don't... I don't see it.

935
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:26,724
这是根阴茎 而这是这个阴茎插进屁股里
There's a penis, and there's the penis going into the butt.

936
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:32,772
哦 天呐
Oh, my God.

937
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:37,902
哦 我的天呐 这是个鸡鸡... 这是个鸡鸡... 这是个爆菊
Oh, my God, it's a cock... It's a cock... It's a cock in a butt.

938
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:40,112
哦 我的天...
Oh, my Go...

939
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,449
哦 天呐 太糟糕了
Oh, my God. That's really bad.

940
01:01:43,617 --> 01:01:45,159
这不是玩笑 塞莱斯特
This isn't a joke, Celeste.

941
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:48,371
封面上有性行为的标志
There's homosexual butt sex in the logo.

942
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:52,875
赖利以为我们傻吗? 我想说 这都是群什么烂货啊?
Does Riley think we're stupid? I mean, who are these sick people?

943
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:55,920
我们目前还没法联系到赖利本人...
Neither Riley nor a representative from Pop Form...

944
01:01:56,088 --> 01:01:59,131
以及流行论坛设计公司的发言人联系上...
the marketing company responsible, could be reached...

945
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:30,287
给你
There you go.

946
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:32,957
- 如果需要别的就给我说一声  - 谢谢
- Let me know if you need anything else.  - Thanks.

947
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:40,798
- 嗨  - 嗨
- Hey.  - Hey.

948
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:44,218
谢谢你能出来见我
Thanks for meeting me here.

949
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:46,137
我也不知道该穿什么出来
I don't know what I'm wearing.

950
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:49,557
- 你看起来像个养猫的疯女人  - 是啊
- You kind of look like a crazy cat lady.  - Yeah.

951
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:53,686
我不能买漂亮的衣服 因为我会糟蹋了的 你懂吗? 
I just can't buy anything nice, because they'll just ruin it, you know?

952
01:02:56,606 --> 01:03:00,109
- 听我说 塞莱斯特...  - 让我先说 好吗?
- Look, Celeste...  - No, let me just say something, okay?

953
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:03,362
我不知道你那边情况怎么样...
I don't know what's going on in your other situation...

954
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:07,491
不过我只是想说 我搞砸了
but for the record, I fucked up.

955
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:12,288
过去我对你很漫不经心 还认为理所应当
I was cavalier with you, and I took us for granted.

956
01:03:12,456 --> 01:03:17,084
我知道这很疯狂 但是若不这样我会觉得被怠慢...
And I know this sounds crazy, but I would be remiss if I didn't just...

957
01:03:17,252 --> 01:03:22,006
如果你能接受 我一定能...
If you were open to it, I feel like I could do better...

958
01:03:22,174 --> 01:03:25,217
更好的处理我们的关系
with you, with us.

959
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:29,472
我想知道我们还有没有希望 
And if there is still a chance, I'd love to know.

960
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:38,939
杰西啊
Jesse.

961
01:03:39,483 --> 01:03:41,275
抱歉
I'm sorry.

962
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:43,986
我不能这么做
I can't.

963
01:03:52,746 --> 01:03:54,538
嘿
Hey.

964
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:58,959
嘿 你昨晚为什么过来?
Hey. Why'd you come over last night?

965
01:04:00,128 --> 01:04:02,254
- 我不知道  - 不 我想你很清楚
- I don't know.  - No, I think you do know.

966
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:06,300
- 那就是个错误 我不该去  - 你个懦夫
- It was a mistake. I shouldn't have come.  - You fucking coward.

967
01:04:06,468 --> 01:04:08,177
我和别人有孩子了
I'm having a baby.

968
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:11,347
我必须和维罗妮卡好好过日子
I need to figure out a way to make it work with Veronica.

969
01:04:11,515 --> 01:04:14,642
- 我正在尝试改变  - 你为什么不肯为我改变?
- I'm trying to change.  - Why didn't you change for me?

970
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:17,353
我觉得你根本不需要我改变
I don't think you really wanted me to.

971
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:21,774
哇哦 我一直在等你成熟起来
Wow. Wow. All I did was wait for you to grow up.

972
01:04:21,942 --> 01:04:24,610
我一直支持你 我为一切买单
I rooted for you. I fucking paid for everything.

973
01:04:24,778 --> 01:04:27,947
- 我为你付出一切  - 是啊 但是我永远赶不上你
- I did everything for you.  - Yeah, and I was never your equal.

974
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:29,907
我觉得你喜欢这样的生活
And you know what,I think you preferred it that way.

975
01:04:30,075 --> 01:04:33,786
等等 我知道我的成就让你不安
Wait. Wait. I know that my success was never okay for you.

976
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:38,415
- 你到底想怎样?  - 我要你承认错误
- What do you want?  - I want you to admit that you're wrong.

977
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:39,917
我做错了什么?
Wrong about what?

978
01:04:40,085 --> 01:04:43,462
你到底想要我怎么做 等你先和别人约会?
What did you expect me to do, wait for you to meet someone first?

979
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:45,589
这就是你想要的?
Is that how you saw it happening?

980
01:04:45,757 --> 01:04:48,759
听着 我也不想这么快就约会 但是已经发生了
Look, I didn't expect to meet someone so fast, but I did.

981
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:52,096
我有机会抓住幸福 我不想搞砸
I have a real chance of being happy. I don't wanna blow that.

982
01:04:52,264 --> 01:04:56,392
你知道什么 杰西? 你一定会搞砸
Well, you know what, Jesse? You definitely will blow it.

983
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:01,855
我真为你悲哀
You know, I feel sorry for you.

984
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:05,150
你或许会孤独终老
You might actually be alone your whole life.

985
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:10,030
- 永远别给我打电话  - 放心 我不会的
- Don't ever call me.  - Yeah, don't worry about it.

986
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:28,507
不 不 不
No, no, no.

987
01:05:28,675 --> 01:05:29,842
别这样
No, no.

988
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:32,970
好吧
Okay.

989
01:05:36,558 --> 01:05:37,766
谢谢
Thank you.

990
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:45,816
- 他好悲伤  - 没错
- He's so sad.  - Totally.

991
01:05:45,984 --> 01:05:47,860
等一下
Wait.

992
01:05:49,237 --> 01:05:52,448
不对 他在画兔子 他很高兴 
No. He's painting little rabbits. He's so happy.

993
01:05:52,616 --> 01:05:56,452
我能看出来 他很悲伤 我去过艺术展
He's so sad. I know. I went to art camp.

994
01:05:58,371 --> 01:06:00,456
什么?
Oh, word?

995
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:03,000
靠
Fuck.

996
01:06:03,168 --> 01:06:05,085
好吧
All right.

997
01:06:05,253 --> 01:06:09,131
要堕落就现在堕落吧
If that's how it's going down, that's how it's going down right now.

998
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:12,509
抽吧 
Hit it. Go get it.

999
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:21,644
这是近几个月来最开心的事情了
That's the best thing that's happened to me in months.

1000
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,854
会时来运转的
Shit will get better.

1001
01:06:24,022 --> 01:06:26,065
会吗? 你都不了解
Will it? You don't know that.

1002
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:33,238
- 真没想到他会这样对我  - 谁? 杰西吗?
- I can't believe he did this to me.  - Who? J?

1003
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:36,700
他没做错什么 是你想要离婚的
He didn't do nothing. You wanted a divorce.

1004
01:06:36,868 --> 01:06:38,869
没错 但是我不想以这种方式收场
Yeah, but I didn't want it like this.

1005
01:06:39,037 --> 01:06:42,498
如果改变不了环境
When we're no longer able to change a situation...

1006
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:45,542
那就改变自己吧
we're challenged to change ourselves.

1007
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:48,420
维克多・弗兰克(心理学家)说的
Viktor Frankl.

1008
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:51,590
也可能是大大小小(说唱歌手)说的
Or Biggie Smalls. It might be Biggie Smalls.

1009
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:54,218
我不记得了
I don't know. I don't remember.

1010
01:06:54,386 --> 01:06:56,887
靠 我嗑高了 你高了吗?
Fuck, man. I am fucking high. Are you high?

1011
01:06:57,305 --> 01:07:00,265
我嗨爆了 得走了
I'm so high. All right, I gotta go.

1012
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:02,142
- 我能跟你去吗?  - 不行
- Can I come?  - No.

1013
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:04,561
- 能给我带点玉米卷吗?  - 不能
- Can you get me some Del Taco?  - No.

1014
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:07,189
你觉得奥巴马夫妇是真心相爱吗?
Do you think the Obamas really love each other?

1015
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:09,733
是的 我相信
Yeah. Yeah, I really do.

1016
01:07:11,236 --> 01:07:12,277
没问题了吧
No more questions.

1017
01:07:13,655 --> 01:07:16,615
嗑药小心点 那对孩子不益
Take it easy on that shit. It is not for kids.

1018
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:42,599
嗨
Hey.

1019
01:07:43,518 --> 01:07:44,643
- 嗨 亲爱的  - 嗨
- Hi, honey.  - Hi.

1020
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:47,521
- 还记得艾琳吧  - 还有沙拉酱吗?
- You remember Eileen.  - You have more ranch dressing?

1021
01:07:47,689 --> 01:07:49,857
- 太好吃了  - 你吃完...?
- It's the fucking bomb.  - Did you finish...?

1022
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:51,942
贝丝就要结婚了
Beth is getting married.

1023
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:56,029
我也曾结过婚 还记得吗? 你们以后一定会有矛盾的
I was married once. You remember? These guys are in for a fucking dogfight.

1024
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:58,157
- 我给你倒杯苏打水吧  - 有矛盾
- Let's go get you a soda.  - A dogfight.

1025
01:07:58,324 --> 01:07:59,533
矛盾重重
You're a dogfight.

1026
01:07:59,701 --> 01:08:01,744
我不想孤独终老
I don't wanna be alone forever.

1027
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:05,080
亲爱的 你不会孤独终老的
Oh, honey. You're not gonna be alone forever.

1028
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:07,708
你只是需要点时间重振旗鼓
You're just in a time-out till you sober up.

1029
01:08:07,876 --> 01:08:10,753
我就坐这里 不会再让你尴尬了 好吧?
I'm gonna sit here. I'm not gonna embarrass you, okay?

1030
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,129
- 好的  - 好的
- Okay.  - Okay.

1031
01:08:27,395 --> 01:08:30,147
我们应该让尼克・诺尔蒂离开 是吧?
We should get Nick Nolte out of here, huh?

1032
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:35,194
嘿 赖利 我想跟你谈一下...
Hey, Riley. I am calling to talk to you...

1033
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:39,656
封面上的错误
about the error in your logo.

1034
01:08:39,824 --> 01:08:41,658
我真的非常非常抱歉
I'm so, so sorry.

1035
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:45,996
我想告诉你我正在尽力补救
And I just wanna let you know that I am on top of it.

1036
01:08:46,164 --> 01:08:48,165
请回话 谢谢
Please call me back. Thank you.

1037
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:52,419
你觉得我应该穿这件碎花的还是玫瑰花的?
Do you feel like the dress I'm wearing reads more like eggshell or rose petal?

1038
01:08:52,587 --> 01:08:56,089
玫瑰花瓣不错 连着两天都穿碎花太单调了
Rose petal's okay. Eggshell is too whitish to do two days in a row.

1039
01:08:56,257 --> 01:08:58,425
- 你看起来棒极了  - 亲爱的 我需要你的帮助
- You look great.  - Honey, I need your help.

1040
01:08:58,593 --> 01:09:01,011
我还有一小时 你欠我的哦...
I have like an hour, and you owe me...

1041
01:09:01,179 --> 01:09:03,222
因为你昨天让我难堪
because you humped my nana yesterday.

1042
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:05,182
赖利・班克斯知道什么啊?
The fuck does Riley Banks know?

1043
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:08,060
什么都不知道 她就是个烂人
Nothing. She's a tart.

1044
01:09:08,228 --> 01:09:11,104
没错 她是烂人 也就有性感的身材罢了
Yes, she's a tart. She's got a cute little hot bod.

1045
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:14,149
- 她资质平平  - 没到平均值
- She's moderately talented.  - Not even.

1046
01:09:14,317 --> 01:09:17,444
- 五年后她就会一脸皱纹  - 可能三年或四年就会的
- Five years and it's a wrap on that face.  - If. Three, four.

1047
01:09:17,612 --> 01:09:19,947
她为何戳中我的痛处?
Why is she telling me anything about my life?

1048
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:21,782
她就是个愚蠢的小...
She's a stupid litt...

1049
01:09:24,744 --> 01:09:28,580
- 天啊 我的天啊  - 怎么了?
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.  - What?

1050
01:09:28,748 --> 01:09:31,416
我还没挂断电话 一直在录音
I never hung up. I didn't hang up the call.

1051
01:09:35,797 --> 01:09:37,381
完蛋了
Crap.

1052
01:09:42,262 --> 01:09:44,012
接电话吧
You gotta get it.

1053
01:09:44,639 --> 01:09:46,557
嗨 赖利 有事儿吗?
Hey, Riley, what's up?

1054
01:09:49,102 --> 01:09:51,270
嗨
Hi.

1055
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:54,523
听我说 我... 这里真漂亮
Listen, I... This is a really nice place.

1056
01:09:54,691 --> 01:09:57,943
事实上 最近我的日子很不好过
The thing is, I've been having a hard time in my own life.

1057
01:09:58,111 --> 01:10:01,488
因此当你说我藐视别人的时候...
So when you said that thing about contempt and investigation...

1058
01:10:01,656 --> 01:10:04,700
你就不能闭嘴吗?
Can you just shut up for a minute?

1059
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:10,581
我刚刚发现男朋友背叛了我
I just found out that my boyfriend cheated on me.

1060
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:17,713
哦 天啊 抱歉 我都不知道你有男朋友
Oh. Oh, God, I'm so sorry. I didn't even know you had a boyfriend.

1061
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:20,090
是啊 没人知道
Yeah, exactly. Nobody knew.

1062
01:10:20,258 --> 01:10:24,344
他不想别人知道 怕影响他的形象...
He didn't want anyone to know, because it would be bad for his image and....

1063
01:10:24,512 --> 01:10:26,305
真是个混蛋
He's just such a fucking asshole.

1064
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:30,726
现在我的前途也要毁了 就因为你在我的封面上放了个阴茎
Now my career might be over because you decided to put a penis in my logo.

1065
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:36,523
- 真得"谢谢"你啊  - 真的很抱歉 非常抱歉
- Thank you for that.  - I know. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1066
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:40,694
过来
Come here.

1067
01:10:40,862 --> 01:10:44,156
- 干嘛?  - 到这来 没事的
- Why?  - Come here. Just come here. It's okay.

1068
01:10:44,324 --> 01:10:45,991
没事的 没事了
It's okay. It's okay.

1069
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:51,204
我现在身心俱疲
I'm just so sad. And tired.

1070
01:10:51,372 --> 01:10:53,790
我要和你一样孤苦伶仃了
And now I'm gonna be alone like you.

1071
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:57,669
你现在语无伦次 会没事的
Okay, you don't know what you're saying right now. It's okay.

1072
01:11:15,939 --> 01:11:19,024
你看体育节目竟然会哭?
Are you crying about sports?

1073
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:23,320
这让我想到了一些往事
Just reminds me of someone.

1074
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:25,322
跟那个女孩有关吗?
Is this about a girl?

1075
01:11:27,075 --> 01:11:30,744
- 我不是同性恋  - 知道 我是指那个男的
- I'm not gay.  - No, I know. I meant a boy.

1076
01:11:32,664 --> 01:11:33,705
没错
Yeah.

1077
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:36,792
你想他吗?
Do you miss him?

1078
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:39,461
嗯 想他
Yeah, I do.

1079
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:42,255
他们都是混蛋
They all fucking suck.

1080
01:11:43,424 --> 01:11:45,133
没错
Kind of.

1081
01:11:46,219 --> 01:11:50,222
真的不会好起来吗? 就算你年华已逝?
It really never gets better? Like, not even when you're old?

1082
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:54,393
是啊
No.

1083
01:11:57,230 --> 01:11:59,106
不过你可以
But you do.

1084
01:12:02,193 --> 01:12:05,237
- 能再抱抱吗?  - 好吧
- Can we hug again?  - Yeah.

1085
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:11,827
不会的 靠
I won't, no. Crap.

1086
01:12:11,995 --> 01:12:14,871
不会的 我到机场了
No, no, no. I'm at the airport.

1087
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:16,957
贝丝 我就坐在候机厅
Beth, I'm sitting at the gate.

1088
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:18,834
我当然穿礼服了
Of course I have my dress.

1089
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:25,173
嗨 先生 抱歉打扰你 能让我插个队吗?
Hi, sir. I'm so sorry to bother you, but is there any way I could cut in line?

1090
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:28,885
我要赶去当伴娘 嗨 抱歉打扰你
I'm the maid of honor at this wedding. Hi. I'm sorry to bother you.

1091
01:12:29,053 --> 01:12:33,223
你可能听到我刚才和最后那位男士的对话了 我真的着急取回礼服
Maybe you heard me talking to the last gentleman, but I need to get my dress.

1092
01:13:51,052 --> 01:13:54,304
当时她正和西班牙人热恋
She pursued her love of Spanish man

1093
01:13:54,472 --> 01:13:57,808
但却对她的塔克异常想念
but missed her Tucker more than just a friend.

1094
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:02,854
后来我们的公主与她挚爱的王子一同归家
Our princess returned home to her loving prince

1095
01:14:03,022 --> 01:14:06,191
从此他们过上了幸福的生活
and they've been together ever since.

1096
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:08,610
我们爱你 贝丝
We love you, Bethy.

1097
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,658
现在该塞莱斯特发言了...
Now we're gonna turn it over to Celeste...

1098
01:14:14,826 --> 01:14:18,120
她是贝丝最好的朋友
Beth's best friend in the world.

1099
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:30,799
哇哦 这个... 谢谢了 美女们
Wow. That... Thanks, girls.

1100
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:35,345
真的... 真的不知道说什么好
That was.... There are no words for what that was.

1101
01:14:37,849 --> 01:14:40,517
呃... 怎样让修女怀孕? 和她做爱
Um... Ahem. How do you get a nun pregnant? You fuck her.

1102
01:14:43,354 --> 01:14:46,022
谢谢你捧场 牧师 感激不尽
Thank you, Reverend. Appreciate it a lot.

1103
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:50,902
从洛杉矶到罗德岛真不容易
It is not easy to get to Rhode Island from Los Angeles.

1104
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:57,534
先要做出租到机场 再做出租到火车站 还要到租车厂
There was a cab to a plane to a cab to a train to a rental car.

1105
01:14:57,702 --> 01:15:01,163
可能还要做人力车
There was maybe a rickshaw in there somewhere.

1106
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:02,831
甚至可能要骑驴
Somewhere a donkey.

1107
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:05,750
但是事实上...
But the truth is...

1108
01:15:05,918 --> 01:15:10,297
我愿意为贝丝到任何地方...
I would go anywhere for Beth...

1109
01:15:10,464 --> 01:15:14,176
因为她是我最好的朋友 我非常爱她...
because she's my best friend and I love her so much...

1110
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:16,511
我真为她高兴
and I'm so happy for her.

1111
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:20,682
在大学快毕业那年 我们有个传统
When we were in college, senior year we had this tradition.

1112
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:24,519
贝丝和塔克还有我和杰西...
Beth and Tucker and me and Jesse would meet...

1113
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:28,190
每周日都去拜访主教 无论是晴天还是阴天
come rain or shine, every Sunday at the Bishop.

1114
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:31,693
他们两个总是有些暧昧...
And there was always something there with these two...

1115
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:33,987
尽管当时他们还是朋友
even though they were just friends.

1116
01:15:34,155 --> 01:15:39,201
他们很有默契
Just, like, an ease that they had with each other.

1117
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:42,329
他们是天作之合
They are perfect.

1118
01:15:43,247 --> 01:15:46,750
最后 爱情战胜了一切
At last, love wins.

1119
01:15:55,218 --> 01:15:56,718
贝丝和塔克...
Beth and Tucker...

1120
01:15:57,220 --> 01:16:01,223
你们很幸运 如此幸运能成为好朋友
you guys are lucky, so lucky to be best friends.

1121
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:04,226
你们要懂得珍惜
Work hard at that.

1122
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:07,187
还要懂得感恩
And respect that.

1123
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:13,026
要有耐心
Be patient.

1124
01:16:14,487 --> 01:16:16,321
还有...
And...

1125
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:19,950
不必事事较真
you don't always have to be right.

1126
01:16:22,536 --> 01:16:24,579
即使你是对的...
Even if you are...

1127
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:27,749
也不要太计较
doesn't fucking matter anyway.

1128
01:16:30,336 --> 01:16:32,671
要为爱奋斗每一天
Fight for it every day.

1129
01:16:34,507 --> 01:16:36,424
真希望我当时能懂
I wish I had.

1130
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:39,010
祝贺你们
Cheers.

1131
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:11,418
可能现在说这个不合时宜...
This might not be the best time to talk about it...

1132
01:17:11,585 --> 01:17:15,714
不过我们也许该赞一下塔克的舞步
but at some point we're gonna have to address Tucker's dance moves.

1133
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:25,765
他真的很特别
He's so special.

1134
01:17:27,393 --> 01:17:29,644
你的发言...
So your speech was...

1135
01:17:29,812 --> 01:17:31,563
不错啊
beautiful

1136
01:17:35,192 --> 01:17:36,776
谢谢
Thank you.

1137
01:17:37,862 --> 01:17:39,612
我是发自肺腑的
I meant it.

1138
01:17:41,282 --> 01:17:43,074
我知道
I know.

1139
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:49,247
你知道还有什么不错吗?

- Oh, nothing. Just....  - It's this thing that Jesse and I do.

1155
01:18:29,372 --> 01:18:33,708
我们把这个东西当做 一个小阴茎...
We take this thing that resembles, like, a tiny little penis...

1156
01:18:33,876 --> 01:18:36,127
然后我们 就像...

- 我爱你 亲爱的  - 我爱你 亲爱的
- I love you, baby.  - I love you, baby.

1164
01:20:22,443 --> 01:20:24,986
你的发言逊毙了
It sounds like the most embarrassing speech ever.

1165
01:20:25,154 --> 01:20:27,155
你以后怎么还有脸出现在你朋友面前?
How are you gonna show your face in front of your friends again?

1166
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:31,451
是啊 很奇怪 我挺高兴那么做 不管怎样我觉得好些了
Yeah, well, weirdly, I'm happy that I did it. I feel better somehow.

这首歌是我的最爱! 耶!
This song is my bitch! Yeah!

1168
01:20:36,207 --> 01:20:40,376
- 基佬还挺会搞派对的 不是吗?  - 你什么意思?
- The gays really know how to party, huh?  - What do you mean?

1169
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:42,086
这是同志俱乐部
This is a gay club.

1170
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:45,131
这只是首场 以后会发展成什么样说不准呢
It's opening night. It doesn't know what it is yet.

1171
01:20:45,299 --> 01:20:49,385
- 赖利 这里被称作"吞吐"  - 我还和那家伙约过会
- Riley, the club is called Swallow.  - I totally dated that guy.

1172
01:20:51,764 --> 01:20:56,935
打扰一下 你能转告赖利 我们很崇拜她吗?
Excuse me. Could you tell your friend Riley that we worship her?

1173
01:20:57,102 --> 01:20:58,311
她太美了
She's so pretty.

1174
01:20:58,479 --> 01:21:00,813
没问题 等她跳完舞我就告诉他
Sure. I'll tell her when she's done dancing.

1175
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:06,861
- 你没发现那个标志是个...?  - 爆菊标志吗? 注意到了
- You are aware that the logo is a...?  - A dick in a butt? Yeah.

1176
01:21:07,613 --> 01:21:12,951
我的朋友都很喜欢这个 它就像是同志穿的服装
All of our friends are, like, rocking it. It's kind of become like gay Izod.

1177
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:15,578
太赞了
It's amazing.

1178
01:21:21,168 --> 01:21:23,336
- 嗨  - 虽然年轻人不喜欢她了...
- Yo.  - The tweens don't want her anymore...

1179
01:21:23,504 --> 01:21:25,088
斯科特 但是同志们喜欢
Scott, but the gays do.

1180
01:21:25,256 --> 01:21:28,633
你也是同志 站在同志的角度上思考 美国有十分之一的人是同性恋
You're gay. Start thinking gay. Ten percent of Americans are gay.

1181
01:21:28,801 --> 01:21:30,593
同志的最爱 太棒了
Gay Izod. It's great.

1182
01:21:30,761 --> 01:21:33,846
明年此时她就能像Lady Gaga一样火了 市场潜力无限啊
She could be Lady Gaga by this time next year. Huge market.

1183
01:21:34,974 --> 01:21:37,559
或许你能让爆菊标志发扬光大呢
You might have turned the cock in the butt around.

1184
01:21:37,726 --> 01:21:39,602
这个将会一发不可收拾
Cock in the butt is gonna be huge.

1185
01:21:42,606 --> 01:21:43,648
嗨
Hi.

1186
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:48,194

Thirty-eight points for me, plus 50 points for using all my tiles.

1187
01:21:48,362 --> 01:21:50,863
- 等一下 起名"祖伊莎"怎么样?  - 是啊
- Wait, wait, wait. "Zooecia"?  - Yeah.

1188
01:21:51,031 --> 01:21:53,866

No, that's not a word. That's my hoochie cousin's name.

1189
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:06,045
有一晚我到这泡吧 有个怪人和我穿的一样
So I was at this club the other night, and there was a tranny dressed like me.

1190
01:22:06,213 --> 01:22:08,172

01:22:10,968 --> 01:22:13,428
- 我还是我  - 真不错
- I mean, it was still me.  - That is so sweet.

1193
01:22:13,596 --> 01:22:15,597
- 嗨 塞莱斯特  - 嗨 鲁珀特
- Celeste.  - Rupert.

1194
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:17,348
你都没给我打过电话
You never called me back.

1195
01:22:17,516 --> 01:22:20,476
你了解的 我弄丢了...
You know, I think I lost my....

1196
01:22:20,644 --> 01:22:25,106
- 你认识赖利吗? 这位是鲁珀特  - 嗨 其实我是他的超级粉丝
- Do you know Riley? This is Rupert.  - Hi. I'm actually a big fan.

1197
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:26,316
我也是你的超级粉丝
Likewise.

1198
01:22:27,067 --> 01:22:29,193
从这开始 这里开唱
Get in there. Get in there.

1199
01:22:35,326 --> 01:22:37,076
好温柔
Very gentle.

1200
01:22:40,456 --> 01:22:41,789
这里帮我唱一下
Help me out here.

1201
01:23:08,359 --> 01:23:09,859
好了 该一起唱了
All right, both of us.

1202
01:23:10,653 --> 01:23:12,028
不行
I can't do it.

1203
01:23:12,905 --> 01:23:14,697
很抱歉
This. I'm sorry.

1204
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:21,663
什么意思? 你是认真的吗? 为什么?
What do you mean? Are you serious? Why?

1205
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:23,414
我...
I...

1206
01:23:24,625 --> 01:23:27,168
我想保持单身
I think I need to be alone.

1207
01:23:27,961 --> 01:23:31,089
- 我正准备离婚  - 我知道你要离婚
- I'm getting a divorce.  - I know you're getting divorced.

1208
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:35,551
我觉得应该一个人处理这件事
I know, but I think I have to do that alone.

1209
01:23:36,887 --> 01:23:38,888
好吧
Yeah.

1210
01:23:39,932 --> 01:23:42,141
我尊重你的选择
I respect that.

1211
01:23:42,309 --> 01:23:45,311
你准备好了再去做 别强迫自己
You're not ready till you're ready. Don't force it.

1212
01:23:45,979 --> 01:23:48,523
我指的是瑜伽
That's some yoga shit.

1213
01:23:50,192 --> 01:23:52,318

是有机纤维的吗?
Is it made out of organic mung beans?

1223
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:37,238
不 实际上 我从你丢掉的垃圾里翻出来的
No, actually, I found it digging through your trash.

1224
01:24:50,294 --> 01:24:53,337

01:25:03,766 --> 01:25:05,266
你准备做什么?
What are you doing right now?

1229
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:16,903
粤语口音 完全听不懂他们在说什么
Cantonese voices. No respect for when their mouths are actually open.

1230
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:19,447
天啊 我觉得我做不到
Oh, my God. I don't think I could focus on it.

1231
01:25:19,615 --> 01:25:23,367
你不行 那一点都不性感 不过很有趣
You couldn't. It's not sexy, but it's damn funny.

1232
01:25:25,788 --> 01:25:27,747
真漂亮
It's beautiful.

I know we just got divorced, but nobody died, right?

1237
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:54,023
我也不知道怎么了 就是...
I don't know. It's just....

1238

我在想要怎么样...
I was just thinking about how...

1239
01:25:59,530 --> 01:26:01,280
你说的没错
you were right.

1240
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:05,910
我都不知道自己在做什么
I don't know what I'm doing.

1241

那么奋斗也是值得的
Then it's worth fighting for.

1243
01:26:39,361 --> 01:26:41,028

Now I know why you fucking cry all the time.

1245
01:26:44,741 --> 01:26:47,910
- 是在宣泄情感  - 我一直都想告诉你
- This shit's emotional.  - I've been trying to tell you.

1246

You deserve to be happy.

1247

1252
01:27:36,084 --> 01:27:39,962
没错 我可不希望你被某个交响乐团的人抢劫
I should. I don't want you to get mugged by someone from the philharmonic.

1253
01:27:40,130 --> 01:27:41,589
没错
Good idea.
