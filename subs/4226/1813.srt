6
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,400
不

7
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,360
帶目擊者進來

8
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,300
你認識這人嗎?

00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,010
認識

10
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,030

我是他妻子

14
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,680
被告 你能證實這事嗎?

15
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,900
是

16
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,710
目擊者 關於被告你有什麼話要說嗎?

17
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:44,720
從他談話 我知道了他批評黨...

18
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:51,570
特別是蘇聯領導人 史達林同志

19
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,960
他們對你做了什麼?

20
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,460
被告 你能證實這些指控嗎?

21
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,710
目擊者 關於被告你還知道什麼?

22
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,560
他為外國勢力當間諜

23
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,880
被告 你能證實這事嗎?

24
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,900
不是

25
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,470
目擊者 你被寬恕了 守衛!

26
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,530
她已經簽署了充分完整的聲明...

27
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,970
詳述你的間諜和陰謀破壞活動

28
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,690
現在你會簽嗎?

29
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,750
你們對她做了什麼?

30
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,900
1940年 西伯利亞

31
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,040
人民的敵人們

32
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,400
你們四處看看就能瞭解...

33
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:29,480
不是我們的槍 或狗 或鐵絲網 構成你們的監獄

34
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,770
西伯利亞是你們的監獄

35
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:39,150
它所有面積是500萬平方英哩

36
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:46,950
大自然是你們的枷鎖 而且它毫不留情

37
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:56,030
如果大自然沒殺了你...當地人會

38
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:03,200
有一項恩惠是給每位逃犯的頭的

39
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,670
看那些可憐人
Look at those poor men.

40
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,250
他們得到了夜盲癥
They've got night blindness.

41
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,340
我在過渡集中營見過

42
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,350
因為飢餓缺乏維生素
It's vitamin deficiency from starvation.

43
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,380
這裡 這裡

44
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,840
你計劃用一半的配額生存嗎 孩子?

45
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:08,960
看 他是個老人
Look, he's an old man.

46
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,590
我也是老人
I'm an old man.

47
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,140
早上我會活著 他不會
I'll be alive in the morning. He won't.

48
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:19,220
仁慈
Kindness.

49
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,100
在這裡會要了你的命
That can kill you here.

50
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,310
他是美國人
He's American.

51
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,990
在這裡? 怎麼會?
In Here? How?

52
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,990
史達林恨外國人
Stalin hates foreigners,

53
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,530
包括波蘭人
and that includes Poles.

54
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,200
你是波蘭人嗎?
You're Polish, no?

55
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,370
啊哈

56
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,330
我喜歡你們波蘭人
I like you Poles.

57
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,160
你們打抱不平
Your burning sense of injustice,

58
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,840
渴望自由
the yearning for freedom.

59
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,340
卡巴洛夫.安卓.提摩菲耶維屈
Khabarov- Andrei Timofeyevich.

60
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,540
維斯塞克.亞努思
Weiszczek- Janusz.

61
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,390
我能問一下你的罪名嗎 亞努思?
Your charge, may I ask, Janusz?

62
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:58,930
第58條第10項
58-10.

63
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,730
間諜罪
A spy.

64
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,720
他們是那麼告訴我的
That's what they told me.

65
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,220
10年?
Ten years?

66
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,270
不 20年
No. 20.

67
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,400
第58條第14項 破壞罪 10年
58-14. Sabotage. Ten years.

68
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,730
你在蘇聯邊境
And you were on Soviet side of line,

69
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,410
他們逮捕你 控告你間諜罪
and they arrest you. They accuse you of spying.

70
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,870
折磨你 嗯?
Torture you, huh?

71
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,410
你簽認罪書了嗎?
Did you sign confession?

72
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,900
沒有
No.

73
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,610
沒有 我不簽
No, I wouldn't sign,

74
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,950
所以他們 他們折磨別人
so they-they tortured someone else.

75
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,760
原諒我
Forgive me.

76
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,920
我是位演員
I was actor.

77
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,460
電影
Moving pictures.

78
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:38,220
上次電影 我演貴族
In my last picture, I played aristocrat.

79
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,550
當影片發佈時他們逮捕我
They arrested me when the film was released.

80
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,100
為什麼?
Why?

81
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,890
它被控訴
it was claimed

82
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:49,440
我在鼓吹舊貴族地位
I was elevating the status of the old nobility.

83
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,990
所以你因為在影片中表演 而被判刑10年
So you got ten years for a performance in a film.

84
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,490
我的公告好一點
I've had better notices.

85
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,200
不
Nyet.

86
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,760
我繼續賒帳

87
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,260
賒帳? 你已經負債中了

88
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,300
烏爾奇幫
The Urki.

89
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:25,140
你知道這些人是誰?
Do you know who these are?

90
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,810
職業犯
Professional criminals.

91
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,140
殺人犯和小偷
Murderers and thieves.

92
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,150
別盯他們看
Don't stare at them.

93
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,650
警衛讓他們在這裡圍事
The guards let them run things in here,

94
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,280
而且他們令人害怕
and they are to be feared.

95
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,110
那麼為何他們讓他們圍事?
Then why would they let them run things?

96
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,190
因為他們是中產階級的產物
Because they are byproduct of bourgeois society

97
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,280
和所謂人民的朋友
and so friends of people.

98
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:49,490
我們是政治犯和所謂人民的敵人
We are political prisoners and so enemies of people.

99
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:53,050
蘇聯已經變成一個大監獄
The Soviet Union has become one vast prison.

100
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,120
奴役勞工
Slave labor.

101
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,340
他們遠在蘇聯帝國之外
They are from far reaches of Soviet Empire,

102
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:02,720
全被抓進相同的鐵絲網
all caught up in same net.

103
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,970
啊 他們之中有人設法 逃離這個鐵絲網嗎?
And, uh, do any of them wriggle out of the net?

104
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,100
沒有 亞努思 你必須更小心點
No, Janusz. You must be more careful.

105
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,400
史達林到處有耳目
Stalin has eyes and ears everywhere,

106
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:17,980
甚至在這裡面
even in here.

107
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,990
如果你不更小心點
If you are not more careful,

108
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,240
一年後你會死
you will die after one year.

109
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:24,910
即使不是字面上的死
If not literally,

110
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,000
那麼就是心死
then spirit.

111
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,750
你在這裡面多久了?
And how long have you been in here?

112
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,080
11個月又29天
Eleven months and 29 days.

113
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,800
我要這件毛衣

114
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:49,890
拿這件外套吧

115
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,890
我要毛衣

116
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,620
你祖母做給你的嗎?

117
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,380
你在這裡沒有權力

118
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,000
毛衣

119
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,470
換香腸

120
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:17,210
你替我畫
You do for me.

121
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,910
你要我畫你?
You want me to draw you?

122
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:21,090
不 不是我
No. Not me.

123
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:26,890
當海盜盯著他時 吉姆身體感到一陣顫抖

124
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,800
他全身是傷疤和刺青

125
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,440
而且他只有一條腿

126
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,570
他說"我是隆.約翰.席爾維" (名著金銀島的海盜船長)

127
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:45,200
我知道一個像那類型的故事 記得伊果嗎? 他有一條腿

128
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,260
閉嘴

129
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,670
繼續講 你會獲得一些麵包的

130
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,950
那麼這位隆.約翰.席爾維如何找到寶藏的?

131
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:09,400
因此吉姆與這幫窮兇惡極之徒航向金銀島

132
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:20,320
這些人殺人不眨眼 這些人只愛金子

133
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,120
寄生蟲?
Lice?

134
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,950
吃我為生
Eating me alive.

135
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,950
關於那個 我有祖傳秘方 過來
For that I have old folk remedy. Come.

136
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,340
礦坑
The mine.

137
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,390
他們晚上炸
They blast at night.

138
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,800
你在幹什麼?
What are you doing?

139
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:59,140
我們必須快點
We must be quick.

140
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,640
否則在早上這個不會在這裡了
Or this will not be here in the morning.

141
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,070
你打算留它在這裡過夜? 為什麼?
You're going to leave it here overnight? Why?

142
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,730
你會知道的
You'll see.

143
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,670
這事做得到的
It can be done.

144
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,370
我知道穿越鐵絲網的辦法
I know a way through the wire.

145
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,830
怎麼穿越?
How?

146
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,790
拉扎爾 我的同伴
Lazar, my associate,

147
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,880
他是建築物的監工
he is overseer of construction.

148
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,180
他指給我看的
He showed me.

149
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:40,010
如果你曾想逃離這集中營
If you ever escape the camps,

150
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,140
而我一直等待像你這樣的人很久了
and I've been waiting so long for someone like you,

151
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,320
有力量
someone with the strength,

152
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,520
有意志能克服
the will to see it through.

153
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,520
但去哪裡?
But to go where?

154
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,700
我意思是 我們不能往西走
I mean, we can't go west.

155
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,490
我意思是 除了德國人外 就是蘇聯人
I mean, apart from the Germans, there's the Soviets.

156
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,070
而東邊 整個蘇聯直到太平洋
And east, all Soviet right to the Pacific.

157
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,700
不 不 不 不
No, no, no, no.

158
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,370
北邊 必須是... 必須是南邊
North. Have to be- have to be south.

159
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,170
答對了
Correct.

160
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,870
但你知道我們在哪裡嗎? 我意思是 確切位置?
But do you know where we are? I mean, exactly?

161
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:12,800
我相信我們大約在 貝加爾湖北方500公里地方
I beileve we are about 500 kilometers north of Lake Baikal.

162
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:15,050
這是湖
This is the lake.

163
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,550
集中營在這裡
Camp is here.

164
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,390
邊境在這裡
And the border is here.

165
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,550
我們可以順著湖這裡的邊緣
We could follow the edge of the lake here.

166
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,430
往南
That runs due south.

167
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,890
正是 然後我們穿越西伯利亞大鐵路
Exactly. Then we cross the Trans-Siberian Railway

168
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,520
到蒙古邊境獲得自由
to the Mongolian border and freedom.

169
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:30,270
春天已經來了
Spring is already upon us.

170
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,940
我們必須等到秋天
We will have to wait till autumn.

171
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,240
不 為什麼等?
No. Why wait?

172
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,280
為什麼?
Why?

173
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:38,080
因為到邊境是1000公里 也許更多
Because it is a thousand kilometers to the border, maybe more.

174
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,700
我們需要小心計劃 我們需要屯積食物
We need careful planning. We need to stockpile food.

175
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,280
我已經開始交易 分配
I've already begun trading, dealing.

176
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,120
你必須做一樣的事
You must do the same.

177
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,920
秋天天氣較能預測
And in autumn, the weather is more predictable.

178
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,890
我們可以用新雪掩蓋我們的足跡
We can use the new snow to cover our tracks.

179
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,310
還有我們帶上我的朋友
And we bring my friends.

180
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,260
你的朋友? 你信任他們?
Your friends? You trust them?

181
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,880
當然
Of course.

182
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,770
他們不會全部生存的
They won't all survive.

183
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,850
但他們死時會是自由人
But they will die free men.

184
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,400
自由
Free.

185
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,720
停

186
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,030
看 天氣越來越壞了

187
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,120
我們能怎麼辦?

188
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,420
你決定

189
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,300
我們會凍死的

190
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,010
我們應該回去

191
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,420
對 然後他們會要我腦袋

192
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:44,900
指揮官 我們即將死在這裡

193
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,030
休息

194
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,110
我們會凍死的

195
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,600
我們死定了

196
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,210
蹲到地上

197
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:54,850
蹲下

198
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,650
不到一小時我們就會凍死

199
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,520
如果你現在倒斃 我不會有意見的

200
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,690
對 但損失200人...

201
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,400
你們就得解釋一番了

202
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,100
事情可能對你們很糟

203
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,090
蹲到地上

204
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:12,310
我們可以前進森林找掩蔽

205
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,350
蹲到地上

206
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,370
站住

207
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,800
留在你的位置

208
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,280
我會開槍的

209
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,780
那是個真正勇敢的人!
That's a really brave man!

210
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:56,340
讓犯人在森林裡掩蔽

211
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:02,140
如果他們跑就射殺他們

212
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,170
首先我們需要大樹枝!
First we need big branches!

213
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,220
一邊一個 然後一個在後面!

214
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,510
幫我 卡濟

215
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,440
這些放那裡 放在樹枝上
These down there, put it there on the branch.

216
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,010
好 好
Yes, yes.

217
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,600
跟我來 我們都像這樣做
Follow me. We'll both go like this.

218
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:36,730

222
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,370
作為防風牆
For a wind break.

223
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,160
進去 來吧
Get in. Come on.

你瘋了嗎? 他們會射殺你的

在集中營裡沒有無緣無故的事情

你是個冷血的討厭鬼 密斯特

我依然活著 就我所知

我以為你是個獨行俠
I thought you were a loner.

286
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,240
獨自一人是無法辦到的

而且 你有個弱點

你對我可能有用
You could be useful to me.

289
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,740
那是什麼?
And what is that?

00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,790
仁慈
Kindness.

291

我得靠你背我

暴風雪會掩蓋我們的足跡
The storm will cover our tracks.

302
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,980
不 不 不 你在說什麼? 它是個過境暴風雪!
No, no, no. What are you talking about? It's a passing storm!

303
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,270
不 這樣就夠了
No, it's enough.

304
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,850
亞努思 那是不可能的
Janusz, that is impossible.

305
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:17,190
我們需要...我們需要周詳的準備
We need- We need detailed preparation,

306
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,820
我們需要計劃 我們需要地圖
we need plans, we need maps.

307
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:20,990
不 不 時機永遠不會完美的
No, no, the timing will never be perfect.

308
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,780
看 他們現在沒有預期到暴風雪
Look, they won't expect it now.

309
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:24,200
你瘋了嗎?
Are you crazy?

310
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:26,120
距離呢?
What about the distances, huh?

311
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:28,450
它是...它是1000公里 並且我們需要食物
It's, it's a thousand kilometers, and we need food.

312
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,030
大量的食物
Plenty of food.

313
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:31,460
但是...但是我們有食物 你有食物
But, but we have food. You have food.

314
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,040
注意 美國人跟我們一起
Look, the American is with us.

315
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,840
我們一直在交易 就像你說的
We've been trading, just like you said.

316
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,170
那能持續多久?
How long will that last?

317
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,550
注意 我已經花費半生
Look, I've spent half my life

318
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,840
在森林和山裡
In the woods and mountains.

319
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:41,670
離開這地方我們可以活下去
We can live off the land.

320
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,840
你不明白 你太年輕
You don't understand. You are too young.

321
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:44,890
這事是辦不到的
It cannot be done.

322
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,010
還有什麼?
What else is there?

323
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,180
你聽到我說的嗎?
You hear me?

324
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,310
待在這裡然後死?
To stay here and die?

325
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,930
這事是辦不到的
It cannot be done.

326
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,860
安卓! 我們要如何穿越鐵絲網?
Andrei! How do we get through that wire?

327
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,020
我不知道你在說什麼
I don't know what you are talking about.

328
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,060
你的朋友拉扎爾...
Your friend Lazar-

329
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,650
我意思是 他知道不是嗎?
I mean, he knows, doesn't he?

330
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,360
是你告訴我的
You told me that.

331
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,800
馬上離開
Piss off now.

332
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,520
你看不見對吧?
You can't see, can you?

333
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,220
拜託不要丟下我
Please don't leave me behind.

334
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,850
答應我 安德瑞斯
Promise me, Andrejs.

335
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:38,110
晚上我可以抓住你的肩膀
I can hold onto your shoulder by night.

336
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,610
我可以 我可以看見形狀
I can-I can see shapes.

337
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,410
白天我可以剛剛好看見
By day I can see just fine.

338
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:46,080
我不會阻礙你的
I won't hold you up.

339
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,240
拜託不要告訴其他人
Please don't tell the others.

340
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:53,920
在這裡面我會死
In here, I die.

341
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,000
瑞士的
Swiss.

342
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,170
金錶

343
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,270
首先你必須停止發電機

344
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,550
燈光會暗下來 可能只有10分鐘

345
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,670
那是你的機會

346
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,930
你必須等到最後的哨兵換班

347
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:06,490
這裡沒有秘密
There are no secrets here.

348
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,160
你要做什麼?
What do you want?

349
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,660
遊戲我輸了
The game goes against me.

350
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:13,780
小債 他們剁手指
Small debt, they take fingers.

351
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,490
大債 他們砍頭
Big debt, they take head.

352
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,790
我 大債
Me, big debt.

353
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,500
但我永遠不會賭我的狼
But I never gambie my Wolf.

354
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,050
在森林裡 你需要刀子
In forest, you need knife,

355
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,670
而我需要奇? 帶我離開這裡
and I need miracle. Get me out of here.

356
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,260
他們砍斷了柱子

357
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,660
我看不見

358
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:09,350
那裡! 鐵絲網被剪斷了

359
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:15,960
放狗

360
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,960
來吧! 來吧!
Come on! Come on!

361
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,800
小心! 繼續走 繼續走!
Look! keep going. Keep going!

362
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:54,220
我們必須繼續走! 起來!
We must keep going! Get up!

363
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,770
起來!
Get up!

364
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,590
動起來 否則我們馬上會死
Activity, or we die right now.

365
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:59,930
你知道狗跑得多快
You know how fast the dogs are.

366
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,650
跑啊 該死!
Run, damn you!

367
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:04,100
密斯特 來啊 看著我
Mister, come on, look at me.

368
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:06,440
到了我背你的時候嗎?
Is it time for me to carry you?

369
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,730
來吧 來吧
Come on. Come on.

370
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,190
來吧!
Come on!

371
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:17,290
亞努思 我們看不見東西!
Janusz, we can't see anything!

372
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:20,240
雪讓我們看不見!
The snow is blinding us!

373
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,000
亞努思!
Janusz!

374
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,050
我需要你的刀!
I need your knife!

375
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,640
給我刀子!
Give me the knife!

376
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:40,560
你的刀!
Your knife!

377
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:50,980
亞努思 我們必須找掩蔽!
Janusz, we must take shelter!

378
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:52,360
我們無法繼續下去!
We can't go on!

379
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:55,490
你不明白嗎? 這太完美了!
Don't you see? This is perfect!

380
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,160
像這樣他們永遠不會發現我們
They'll never find us like this.

381
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,400
永遠不會!
Never!

382
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,980
你盯著我像是蛇盯著兔子
You stare at me like snake at rabbit.

383
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,190
他教我英語
He teach me English.

384
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,690
說得很好吧?
Speak good, huh?

00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:43,080
麵包換語言 不是嗎 牛仔?
Bread for words, wasn't it, cowboy?

386
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:45,080
我們已經來到多遠?
How far have we come?

387
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:48,710
也許20 30公里
Maybe 20, 30 kilometers.

388
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,260
就那樣?
That's all?

389
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,330
更少 如果我們一直繞圈子的話
Less, if we've been going in circles

390
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,260
像無頭雞一樣
like chicken without head.

391
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:58,680
好吧 我們看看有什麼
All right, let's see what we have.

392

你有嗎?
Do you have?

397
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,610
那件外套
And that coat.

398
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,070
它不是你的外套
It's not your coat.

399
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,200
那是卡巴洛夫的外套
That is Khabarov's coat.

400
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:25,530
對 他給我的

還有...
And...

00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,590
嗯? 嗯?

403

看見了嗎?
See?

404
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,800
他要去告發
He was going to inform.

405
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,760
別擔心 我跟他說了
Don't worry. I talk to him.

406
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:48,180
一切沒事
Everything okay.

407
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,610
你和魔鬼做了交易
You've made a bargain with the devil.

408
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,940
你瞭解嗎?
You realize that?

409
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,450
你有刀嗎?
Do you have a knife?

410
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:14,120
他用草和苔蘚辨認方向 那是什麼?
For direction he uses grass and the mosses. What's that?

411
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:16,250
我向上帝發誓 他最好知道他在幹嘛
I swear to God he better know what he's doing.

412
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:18,510
你應該感激 你畢竟在這裡
You should be grateful you're here at all.

413
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,460
感激是給狗的
Grateful is for dogs.

414
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:31,310
是什麼... 那是什麼?
What- What's that?

415
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,980
狼 只是狼而已
Woives. It's only wolves.

416
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,730
只是狼而已

417
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,210

到貝加爾湖
To Lake Baikal.

419
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:53,060
你是"帕坎"

420
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,190
是嗎?
Am I?

00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,390
什麼是帕坎?
What is a Pakhan?

422
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,240
烏爾奇幫的老大
Boss of Urki.

423
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,530
我們不是罪犯
We are not criminals.

424
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,900
我們脫離了罪犯
We are escaping from criminals.

425
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,400
我一直在注視你
I have been watching you.

426
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,240
我向上帝發誓 你贏得我的尊敬

427
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:10,410
包括你的手杖和松果
with your sticks and pine cones.

428
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,910
在你面臨生死之際 我會為你挺身而出
I'll come between you and death.

429
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,210
所以你想當我的保鑣?
So you want to be my bodyguard?

430
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,790
這是Urka的方式
It's the Urka way.

431
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,800
你有我 而且你有這隻狼
You have me, and you have the Wolf.

432
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:23,750
嗯?

433
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:26,260
亞努思 我們到達湖要多久?
Janusz, how long till we get to the lake?

434
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,430
多久?
How long?

435
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:29,300
三 四個星期

436
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,180
也許更多
Maybe more.

437
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:43,450
我猜我們在這裡某處
I have us here somewhere.

438
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:46,440
下去這裡 西伯利亞大鐵路

439
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,780
然後蒙古邊境

440
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,990
蒙古似乎很遠
Mongolia seems so far away.

441
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,790
蒙古? 我走更遠

442
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,120

我們沒有火柴了

445

但我們仍然有卡巴洛夫的打火石

446
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,310

447
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:11,470
我會做陷阱
I can make traps.

448
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,970
我們移動太快 等不及陷阱
We'll be moving too fast to wait for traps.

449
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:17,520
我們找農場 村莊那裡取得食物
We find farms, villages, get food there.

450
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:19,820
看 有項恩惠在我們頭上 記得嗎
Look, there's a bounty on our heads. Remember that.

451
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,610
我們晚上偷 他們永遠不會知道
We steal it. At night. They never know.

452
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,150
我們不是小偷
We are not thieves.

453
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,990
那麼我會偷 而且我會吃
Then I'll steal it, and I'll eat.

454
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,160
你可以看
You can watch.

455
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,280
那是什麼?
What is that?

456
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:30,580
帶刺鐵絲網
Barbed wire.

457
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,500
他在做魚鉤
He's making a fish-hook.

458
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,960
那就是我們如何生存的方法了
That's how we will survive.

459
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:34,830
吃魚?
With fish?

460
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,000
啊

461
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,790
但我不吃魚
But I don't eat fish.

462
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,870
那麼你會死
Then you'll die.

463
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,170
來吧
Come on,

464
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,670
我們需要生火
we need to make a fire.

465
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,170
來吧 要很多木材
Come on, lots of wood.

466
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:50,050
今晚會在零下40度
It'll be 40 below tonight.

467
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,100
托馬斯?
Tomasz?

468
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:08,360
不 不 不要太多 不要太多
No, no, not too much, not too much.

469
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:22,790
卡濟?
Kazik?

470
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:29,090
卡濟?
Kazik?

471
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:32,590
他仍然在外面找木材
He's still out, looking for wood.

472
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,930
他有夜盲癥
He has night blindness.

473
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:37,970
卡濟!
Kazik!

474
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:38,640
卡濟!
Kazik!

475
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,820
亞努思!
Janusz!

476
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,090
亞努思!
Janusz!

477
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,140
教授
Professor.

478
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,770
我從礦坑來找你
I came from the mine to find you.

479
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,860
我以為我是獨自一人
I thought I was alone.

480
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:10,650
我一直跟著你走了一些時間了
I've been walking with you for some time.

481
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:13,360
我...我只是坐一會兒
I'll- I'll just sit for a minute.

482
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:29,790
不遠了
Not far to go.

483
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:38,770
我們做到了
We made it.

484
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,890
我們真的做到了
We really made it.

485
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:49,360
那不是很了不起嗎?
Isn't that something?

486
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:43,910
上帝 安息這個無辜的靈魂吧
Lord, take this innocent soul into thy keeping.

487
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,460
阿門
Amen.

488
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:51,830
今天一位自由人死在這裡
A free man died here today.

489
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,720
此外 少了一張嘴要養
Still, one less mouth to feed.

490
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,600
怎麼?
What?

491
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:29,680
他們會發現我們的骨頭和你的畫
They'll find our bones and your drawings

492
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:31,810
今後100年
a hundred years from now

493
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:36,390
然後說"看 早先古拉格集中營的很好例子"
and say "Look, a fine example of Early Gulag Man. "

494
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:38,850
閉上你的玩笑
Shut up with your jokes.

495
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:40,700
像其他人一樣去找食物
Go and find food like the others do.

496
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,650
你才要閉嘴!
You do the shutting up!

497
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:44,360
整天畫畫 好像你在過節日
Drawing all day like you're on holiday.

498
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:45,660
我生病了
I'm sick.

499
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:47,860
我煮東西 他們找食物
I cook. They find food.

500
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,040
你做過什麼?
What do you ever do?

501
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:52,040
沒有
Nothing.

502
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:54,490
但我讓你笑開懷
But I make you all laugh.

503
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:56,800
不 不再是了 你沒有
No, not anymore, you don't.

504
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:25,690
那麼...
So...

505
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:30,280
誰會是第一個?
who will be first?

506
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:31,960
你是什麼意思 第一個?
What do you mean, first?

507
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,910
第一個死
The first to die.

508
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,960
我想是藝術家
I think the artist.

509
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:40,260
但如果是他更好 這個搞笑人
But better if it was him, the funny man.

510
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:43,920
為何最好是佐仁?
Why better if it's Zoran?

511
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:46,590
較軟
More soft.

512
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,770
較...嫩
More-tender.

513
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:56,720
密斯特現在只能抓很少的魚
Mister only catch little fish now.

514
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,730
我們必須吃肉 否則我們會死在這裡
We must have meat, or we die here.

515
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:01,060
你是帕坎 你思考過了
You're the Pakhan, you've thought of it.

516
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,860
我們全都思考過了
We all have.

517
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:04,610
那就是為何你帶額外的人 不是嗎?
That's why you brought extra people, isn't it?

518
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:05,570
為了食物?
For food?

519
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,450
不 不 不
No, no, no.

520
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:09,120
我們會得到更多的食物 當我們到達貝加爾湖時
We will get more food when we get to Lake Baikal.

521
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,990
那裡會有很多魚
There will be plenty of fish there.

522
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:14,920
你一周前說我們會看見湖
You said we would have seen lake a week ago.

523
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,290
嗯?

524
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:20,330
我們迷路了 帕坎
We're lost, Pakhan.

525
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:12,170
啊!

526
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:14,130
呀!

527
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:19,680
呀!

528
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:22,110
呀! 呀!

529
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:53,920
注意 如果我 啊 如果我找到湖
Look, if I, uh, if I find the lake,

530
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:56,890
一周內我會回來
I will be back in a week.

531
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:02,940
如果我沒回來 那麼就看你們自己了
If I don't, well, you're on your own.

532
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:08,060
我知道
I know.

533
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:10,240
我們的朋友瓦卡
Our friend Valka.

534
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,480
別讓他脫離你的視線
Don't let him out of your sight.

535
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:17,370
給你

我看到湖了
I saw the Lake.

543
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:31,670
放鬆 放鬆
Easy, easy.

00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,170
距離這裡三天
Three days from here.

545
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:34,920
石頭! 收集石頭!
Stones! Gather stones!

546
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:36,470
把它們用火加熱!
Heat them in the fire!

547
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:25,480
怎麼了?
What is it?

548
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:28,560
噓 噓

549

噓 嘿
Hey.

550

有人一直在跟我們
Someone's been following us.

551
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:41,780
他在那簇漆黑的森林後面
He's behind that dark clump of trees.

552
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:43,280
如果他告發我們
If he gives us away,

553
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:46,240
他們會立即遍佈我們周圍
they'll be all over us in no time.

554
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:49,170
他說得對 我們必須這麼做
He's right. We have to do this.

555
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:50,290
不能殺人
No killing.

556
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:51,630
不能?
No?

557
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:53,420
我想你之前已經殺過人
I think you've killed before.

558
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:57,470
你為無辜的人說太多禱告了
You say too many prayers for an innocent man.

559
00:51:57,470 --> 00:51:59,090
瓦卡 你走後面
Valka, you go behind

560
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:01,050
以防他跑去告發 去
in case he makes a run for it. Go.

561
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:06,850
散開 散開
Spread out, spread out.

562
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:21,780
瓦卡 不要
Valka, no.

563
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:23,110
不要!
No!

564
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:36,000
我們...我們不會傷害你
We-we won't hurt you.

565
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:49,340
嗯

566
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,640
波蘭婦女
A Polka.

567
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:52,350
波蘭婦女? 她要幹嘛?
Polka? What does he want?

568
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:53,730
我不知道 是個女孩
I don't know. It's a girl.

569
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:55,680
而且她是波蘭人
And she's Polish.

570
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:57,440
她一直跟著我們好幾天了
She's been following us for several days.

571
00:52:57,530 --> 00:52:59,110
然後怎樣?
And what?

572
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,860
嗯 她需要食物 你知道 保護
Well, she needs food, you know, protection.

573
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:02,990
她一直太害怕接近我們
She's been too afraid to approach us

574
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,360
直到她確認我們不是蘇聯人
until she was sure we weren't Russian.

575
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:06,830
她想跟我們一起旅行嗎?
She wants to travel with us?

576
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:09,080
她在逃亡 像我們一樣
She's on the run, like us.

577
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:11,370
她會拖慢我們速度
She'll slow us down.

578
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,750
她說她逃離
She said she's escaped

579
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,920
從一個蘇聯集中農場
from a Russian collective farm.

580
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:19,840
我知道這類型...街頭吉普賽
I know this type- street gypsies.

581
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:23,010
有好幾千個像那樣的人 比一條狗還沒用!
There are thousands like that, less use than a dog!

582
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:27,590
帕坎 別這麼做 嗯?
Pakhan, don't do this?

583
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:29,390
噢 拜託 她餓死了
Oh, come on. She's starving.

584
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,390
我幾乎無法養我們自己
We can barely feed ourselves.

585
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,010
對 也許丟下她比較好
Yeah, maybe it's kinder to leave her.

586
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:35,190
不 她被送到我們這裡 我們不能丟下她
No, she was sent to us. We can't leave her.

587
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,890
亞努思 我們沒有選擇
Janusz, we have no choice.

588
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,420
嘿 嘿 嘿 嘿!

Stay back.

591
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:17,730
後退 小心泥漿
Stay back. Careful of the mud.

592

593
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,650

596
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,570
她名字叫艾琳娜

597
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,660
肥皂準備好了嗎?

598
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:49,980
對

攪拌

601
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:06,710
那個?

什麼事那麼好笑?
What's so funny?

603
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:11,010
你...
Are you-

604
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:13,260
你今天早上要去辦公室嗎?

605
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:34,740
瓦卡?
Valka?

606
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:35,870
瓦卡

607
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,070

你是下一個 去 去

609
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:41,170
瓦卡 來吧!
Valka, come on!

610
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:50,760
現在脫掉你的襯衫
Now take off your shirt.

611
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:55,130
我們為何做這事?
Why do we do this?

612
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:59,440
那麼我們不會看起來 像是小偷和強盜
So we don't look like thieves and robbers.

613
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:02,050
頭抬起來
Head up.

614
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:07,140
現在別動
Now, still.

615
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:10,940
千萬別動 拜託
Very still, please.

616
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:12,400
頭抬起來
Head up.

617
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:14,990
再抬高一點
More.

618
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:19,360
不
Nyet.

619
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:06,830
你知道嗎 我啊 不相信她是波蘭人
You know, I, uh, can't beiieve she's Polish.

620
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,880
她啊 她受過教育
She's, uh, she's educated.

621
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:11,000
會說流利英語 法語
Speaks good English, French.

622
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:12,670
那樣對嗎?
Is that right?

623
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,670
你不喜歡她嗎?
You don't like her, do you?

624
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,340
跟瓦卡談到她
Speak to Valka about her.

625
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:18,260
他甚至不認為她是波蘭人
He doesn't even think she's Polish.

626
00:58:18,350 --> 00:58:19,560
嗯 我的確和他談過
Well, I did speak to him.

627
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:21,300
還有其他人
And the others.

628
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,850
他們都贊成她跟我們一起來
They agree she comes with us.

629
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,350
怎麼 你不贊成?
What, you disagree?

630
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:30,480
沒有多愁善感的餘地了 你知道的
There's no room for sentimentality, you know that.

631
00:58:30,570 --> 00:58:33,440
撇開食物不說 她會拖慢我們的速度
Apart from food, she'll slow us down.

632
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:04,230
不 它無法承擔我們的重量
No, it won't take our weight.

633
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:06,050
我們必須游泳過去
We'll have to swim across.

634
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:12,100
你會游嗎?
Can you swim?

635
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,610
會 密斯特
Yes, Mister.

636
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:16,190
你不會騙我吧
You wouldn't lie to me.

637
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:17,520
我沒說謊 同志
I'm not lying, Comrade.

638
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:19,570
別叫我同志
And don't call me Comrade.

639
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:29,910
艾琳娜 不要!
Irena, no!

640
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:57,570
這裡 來吧
Here, come on.

641
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,030
這裡 拿著食物
Here, take the food.

642
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:18,170
你父母和你一起被逮捕嗎?
Were your parents arrested with you?

643
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:20,250
他們死了
They're dead.

644
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:23,130
我們住在華沙外的農場
We lived on a farm outside Warsaw.

645
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:24,840
當蘇聯人來時
When the Russians came,

646
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:26,470
他們說我們是富農
they said we were kulaks

647
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:28,850
而且剝削農人
and exploiting the peasants.

648
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:33,480
我父母害怕並把我藏在穀倉內
My parents were afraid and hid me in the barn.

649
01:00:33,490 --> 01:00:35,820
我之後發現他們
I found them later.

650
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:46,820
我...
I-

651
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:53,830
我發現他們臉部向下倒在泥漿中
I found them face-down in the mud.

652
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:58,760
他們被毆打並被帶刺的鐵絲網勒死
They'd been bashed and strangled with barbed wire.

653
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:07,510
之後 蘇聯人抓到我
Later, the Russians caught me

654
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:11,970
然後送我去一個集中農場
and sent me to a collective farm.

655
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:14,480
他們對我很殘酷
They were cruel to me.

656
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:17,180
我逃離了
I ran away.

657
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,360
我沒有食物
I had no food.

658
01:01:19,450 --> 01:01:21,480
然後我看到你們
And then I saw you.

659
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:31,580
你不會游泳嗎?
You can't swim, can you?

660
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,460
什麼?
What?

661
01:01:36,550 --> 01:01:38,210
你一生中從未接近過水
You've never been near the water in your life.

662
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,880
但我過去了不是嗎? 而且你跟隨
But I got across, didn't I? And you followed.

663
01:01:40,890 --> 01:01:44,220
你說你住在靠近華沙的一個農場?
And you said you lived on a farm near Warsaw?

664
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:45,510
對
Yes.

665
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,090
蘇聯不會到那麼遠
Soviets didn't get that far.

666
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:51,720
那是德國領土
That was German territory.

667
01:01:51,810 --> 01:01:55,180
你父母沒被殺害對吧?
Your parents weren't murdered, were they?

668
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,520
你虛構了所有的事
You made all that up.

669
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:04,110
我們可都做了可怕的事以求生存
We've all done terrible things to survives.

670
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,320
因此不要再對我說謊
But don't ever lie to me again.

671
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,290
我們已經受夠了謊話
We've had enough of lies.

672
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:28,970
我們必須繞過去
We have to go around it.

673
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:31,300
快點通過它
Quicker through it.

674
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,260
不 他們有狗
No, they have dogs.

675
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:35,770
如果他們鳴警鈴 那麼我們就沒希望了
If they raise the alarm, then we don't stand a chance.

676
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:37,640
我們再度需要食物 帕坎
We need food again, Pakhan.

677
01:02:37,730 --> 01:02:39,470
看好 我知道我們需要食物
Look, I know we need food,

678
01:02:39,570 --> 01:02:41,900
但我們不能走進那個鎮冒險被捕
but we can't go into that town and risk arrest.

679
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:43,400
我們在浪費時間
We're wasting time.

680
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:02,460
怎麼了? 什麼問題?
What is it? What's wrong?

681
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:03,960
瓦卡在哪裡?
Where's Valka?

682
01:03:03,970 --> 01:03:05,460
他在佐仁後面
He was behind Zoran.

683
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:07,670
佐仁 你沒看著他嗎?
Zoran, weren't you watching him?

684
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:11,850
我不是他的監護人
I'm not his keeper.

685
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:13,550
該死的他
Damn him.

686
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:15,640
他可能為了獎賞改變了我們命運
He could turn us in for the bounty.

687
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:16,940
還有冒險被捕?
And risk arrest?

688
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:19,310
他是個賭徒
He's a gambler.

689
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:22,610
艾琳娜 你想他會那麼做嗎?
Irena, do you think he would do that?

690
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:23,900
他可能會
He might.

691
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:25,350
我們不需要他的刀子
We don't need his knife.

692
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:27,360
我們可以從鹿的骨頭做一個
We can make one out of deer bone.

693
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:29,570
這是個擺脫他的機會
It's an opportunity to get rid of him.

694
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:34,040
好吧 好吧
All right, all right.

695
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:35,710
來吧 我們走
Come on, let's go.

696
01:03:35,790 --> 01:03:38,000
當心點好笑的人?
Watch it funny man?

697
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,490
嘿 嘿 嘿!
Hey, hey, hey!

698
01:03:39,590 --> 01:03:42,170
你想讓我們都被殺嗎? 嗯?
You want to get us all killed? Hmm?

699
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:44,670
嗯?

700
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:48,010
放輕鬆 牛仔
Easy, cowboy.

701
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:50,880
你撕破我的外套
You tear my coat.

702
01:03:50,970 --> 01:03:51,960
白癡
Idiot.

703
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:55,520
白癡? 哈
Idlot? Ha.

704
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,940
是我嗎?
Am I?

705
01:03:57,020 --> 01:03:58,850
我們看誰是白癡
Let's see who is idiot.

706
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:05,060
怎麼?
What?

707
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:06,320
我殺了?
Did I kill?

708
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:09,690
對
Yes.

709
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:11,190
一隻狗
A dog.

710
01:04:11,290 --> 01:04:14,030
不相信我就不要吃
Don't believe me, then don't eat.

711
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:18,910
但你們會吃的不是嗎 因為你們想生存
But you will, won't you, because you want to survive.

712
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,834
我一輩子都知道生存
I know about survive.

713
01:04:20,884 --> 01:04:24,672
All my life.

714
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:27,370
還有...
And-

715
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:29,220
今天是我的生日
it's my birthday.

716
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:32,720
在蘇聯 那意謂我們要喝酒
In Russia, that means we drink.

717
01:05:21,570 --> 01:05:26,360
她住在街上 像我一樣
She lived in the streets, like me.

718
01:05:28,610 --> 01:05:30,900
所以你告訴我們的故事不是真的
So the story you told us wasn't true.

719
01:05:30,990 --> 01:05:32,950
我以為那故事會比較悲傷
I thought that story would be more sad

720
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:34,820
你們不會把我丟下不管
and you wouldn't leave me behind.

721
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:45,920
我父母是波蘭共產黨員
My parents were Polish Communists.

722
01:05:46,010 --> 01:05:50,630
他們帶我們住在蘇聯莫斯科
They took us to live in Soviet Union, to Moscow.

723
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:53,250
他們想從事革命
They want to work for the Revolution.

724
01:05:55,390 --> 01:05:57,630
我們住在盧克斯旅館
We lived in the Hotel Lux,

725
01:05:57,730 --> 01:06:00,840
和許多外國共產黨員一起
with lots of foreign Communists.

726
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:07,480
但他們在1937年逮捕他們
But they arrested them in 1937.

727
01:06:07,570 --> 01:06:09,030
他們說他們是間諜
They said they were spies.

728
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:14,820
他們的人在孤兒院抓到我
The people pot me in the orphanage.

729
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:16,450
和我弟弟
And my brother,

730
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:18,620
他死了
he died.

731
01:06:18,710 --> 01:06:20,700
我當時10歲
I was ten years old.

732
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:28,210
他們叫我莉可
They called me Rykov,

733
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:36,300
但我記得我們的波蘭名字...吉琳斯卡
but I remembered our Polish name- Zielinska.

734
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:42,510
每晚我睡覺前習慣說這名字
I used to say it every night before I went to sleep.

735
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:43,890
所以你逃跑了
So you ran away.

736

那不是很怪嗎?

我們遭遇所有事之後
After all we've faced,

745
01:07:39,290 --> 01:07:42,370
這些小蟲可能擊倒我們

746
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:54,880
在那裡又一次

你沒有彼此交談嗎?
Don't you talk to each other?

775
01:09:35,110 --> 01:09:38,900
在集中營裡你學會盡可能少說話

782
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,710

也許四 五天之遠

790
01:11:17,710 --> 01:11:19,620
我們能從其他地方穿越嗎?

791
01:11:19,710 --> 01:11:21,200
這裡 這是主幹道

792

每個地方都會像這個一樣

793
01:11:23,130 --> 01:11:25,970
他說的對 我們等到晚上

794
01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:33,300

我意思是 他們應該在你屁股上

801
01:11:52,410 --> 01:11:54,830
每次你大便時 你就坐在他們上面
so you can sit on them every time you take a shit.

802
01:11:54,830 --> 01:11:56,540

然後他兩者都拿

你知道他們...他們會抓你

815
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:39,260
是啊 坐牢還好

816
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:40,760
債務不好
Debt is bad.

817
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:42,440
然而有許多的監獄
But there are many prisons,

818
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:43,680
他們找不到我
they don't find me.

819
01:13:46,530 --> 01:13:49,390
美國怎麼辦?
What about America?

820
01:13:49,490 --> 01:13:53,610
哦 它不適合我 自由

我不知道怎麼面對 我發誓
I wouldn't know what to do with it, I swear to God.

822
01:13:59,370 --> 01:14:06,120
所以我們必須說再見了 我的狼和我
So we must say goodbye, my Wolf and me.

823
01:14:06,130 --> 01:14:09,120
你不再需要他了
You don't need him anymore.

824

密斯特!

836
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:06,450
所以這裡也一樣了

837
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:17,630
這改變了所有事
This changes everything.

838
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:21,880
無處可躲
There's nowhere to hide.

839
01:16:38,910 --> 01:16:40,570
它是個佛教廟宇
It's a Buddhist temple.

840
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:43,240
他們可能接納我們
They might take us in.

841
01:16:43,330 --> 01:16:45,790
他們也可能和政權一起工作
They might also be working with the regime.

842
01:16:45,870 --> 01:16:48,080
這是個賭注
It's a risk.

843
01:17:44,310 --> 01:17:46,840
這裡發生什麼事了?
What happened here?

844
01:17:46,850 --> 01:17:49,390
和在蘇聯發生的事一樣
The same as happened in Russia.

845
01:17:54,730 --> 01:17:58,480
教會關閉...

牧師被槍殺或抓去集中營...

847
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:04,820
宗教禁止

848
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:12,820
他們來到我在拉脫維亞的教會
They came to my church, in Latvia.

849
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:15,130
毀損每樣東西 很像這座廟宇
Destroyed everything, much like this.

850
01:18:20,510 --> 01:18:23,750
之後那晚我回去了
I went back later that night,

851
01:18:23,850 --> 01:18:26,510
有一個孤獨...孤獨的守衛
and there was a lone- lone guard.

852
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:30,340
只是一個男孩
Just a boy.

853
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:32,220
然後我勒死他
And I strangled him

854
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:35,270
直到他的眼睛爆出他的頭
until his eyes popped right out of his head.

855
01:18:44,990 --> 01:18:48,910
不知瓦卡怎麼知道的
Valka knew somehow.

856
01:18:48,910 --> 01:18:51,450
他知道我冷血殺人
He knew I'd killed in cold blood.

857
01:19:01,510 --> 01:19:02,870
中國距離多遠?
How far is China?

858
01:19:02,970 --> 01:19:04,580
我不知道
I don't know.

859
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:08,920

860

六百公里?

861
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:13,380
中國自由嗎?

他們正在對抗日本人
They're fighting the Japs.

863
01:19:14,730 --> 01:19:15,850
我只知道那麼多
I know that much.

864
01:19:15,940 --> 01:19:17,810
中國之後是西藏
After China is Tibet.

865
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:20,730
我們可以去首都拉薩
We could go to Lhasa, the capital.

866
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:38,080
什麼? 你在說什麼?

867
01:19:38,170 --> 01:19:39,960
他們說我們可以經過西藏

868

對抗納粹 然後對抗蘇聯

873
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:50,460
越過喜馬拉雅山?
Go over the Himalayas?

874
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:54,180
怎麼過? 坐魔毯嗎?

875
01:19:54,270 --> 01:19:56,480
怎麼過?

880

我正要吃些鹽
I was about to eat some salt.

881
01:20:36,270 --> 01:20:38,310
我幾乎?到了
I almost taste it.

882
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,230
我只是想回去那個夢裡
I just want to go back to that dream.

883
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:43,060
這是非常簡單的食譜
It's a very simple recipe.

884
01:20:43,150 --> 01:20:45,990
你只需要兩根迷迭香
You just need two sprigs of rosemary

885
01:20:46,070 --> 01:20:47,690
和一撮肉豆蔻
and a pinch of nutmeg.

886
01:20:47,780 --> 01:20:50,190
肉豆蔻? 鹽怎麼辦?
Nutmeg? What about the salt?

887
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:52,240
不 我們會...我們會說到的 現在...
No, we'll-we'll get to that. Now-

888
01:20:52,330 --> 01:20:53,410
加點油...
add the oil-

889
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:54,780
嗯嗯

890
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:56,200
然後你將它放進去醃
and you leave it to marinate

891
01:20:56,290 --> 01:20:57,660
當你的雞準備好時
while you prepare the chicken.

892
01:20:57,750 --> 01:20:58,490
這地方放鹽進來
This is where the salt comes in.

893
01:20:58,580 --> 01:21:00,120
很好
Good.

894
01:21:00,210 --> 01:21:01,870
你把它抹在雞的表皮上
You rub it into the skin of the chicken

895
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:03,420
加點辣椒粉
with a little bit of the paprika.

896
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:05,040
但是雙倍的鹽
But double the salt.

897
01:21:05,130 --> 01:21:06,540
注意 你不能只放雙倍的鹽
Look, you cannot just doubie the sait.

898
01:21:06,630 --> 01:21:08,090
那樣會太咸了
It'll be too salty then.

899
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:09,880
我不在乎 就放雙倍的鹽
I don't care, just doubie the sait.

900
01:21:09,890 --> 01:21:11,720
我不打算破壞它
I'm not going to ruin it.

901
01:21:11,810 --> 01:21:13,420
放雙倍的鹽就好 拜託
just double the salt, please.

902
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:14,880
不行
No.

903
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:16,010
托馬斯...
Tomasz-

904
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:17,140
不行
No.

905
01:21:26,990 --> 01:21:28,440
好了 好了 大家保持安靜
All right, all right. Everybody keep calm.

906
01:21:28,530 --> 01:21:29,090
噢 我的天!
Oh, my God!

907
01:21:29,090 --> 01:21:33,242
不 不 不! 別跑! 別跑
No, no, no! Don't run! Don't run.

908
01:21:33,330 --> 01:21:35,490
保持鎮定和微笑 很友善的
Be calm and smile. Be friendly.

909
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:42,290
嘿 喔! 喔!
Hey, whoa! Whoa!

910
01:21:42,380 --> 01:21:43,710
大家微笑
Everybody smile.

911
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:46,360
哈羅 哈羅
Hello. Hello.

912
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:48,980
蘇聯人

913
01:21:49,110 --> 01:21:50,940
不 美國人

914
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:54,040
你去拉薩嗎?

915
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:56,490
拉薩 對 西藏

916
01:21:56,740 --> 01:21:57,420
朝聖

917
01:21:57,850 --> 01:21:58,480
對

918
01:21:59,010 --> 01:22:00,260
沒馬嗎?

919
01:22:01,030 --> 01:22:04,610
我們太窮了沒馬

920
01:22:05,150 --> 01:22:06,120
妻子?

921
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:08,700
不 女兒

922
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:50,070
有水嗎?

923
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:40,200
那是南方
That's south.

924
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:17,360
我們打算吃那個嗎?
Are we going to eat that?

925
01:24:17,450 --> 01:24:20,360
要嘛這個 或是魚
It's either this or fish.

926
01:24:26,290 --> 01:24:28,370
看起來像是鳥巢
It looks like a bird's nest.

927
01:24:28,460 --> 01:24:30,700
它能為你遮蔽陽光
It will protect you from the sun.

928
01:24:35,630 --> 01:24:37,970
艾琳娜 試試你的腳
Irena, try this for your feet.

929
01:25:24,430 --> 01:25:26,140
南方
South.

930
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:28,130
來吧 我們繼續走
Come on, we keep going.

931
01:25:45,290 --> 01:25:47,780
不 它是另一個海市蜃樓
No, it's another mirage.

932
01:25:47,870 --> 01:25:49,080
我們沒有水
We have no water.

933
01:25:50,630 --> 01:25:52,120
那裡有樹
There's trees there.

934
01:25:52,210 --> 01:25:56,000
如果有樹 就有水
If there's trees, there-there's water.

935
01:25:56,010 --> 01:25:57,370
不 我不在乎
No, I don't care.

936
01:25:57,470 --> 01:25:59,330
那是東方 我們要往南
It's east. We're going south.

937
01:25:59,430 --> 01:26:01,960
但是 亞努思 我們必須試一下
But, Janusz, we've got to give it a try.

938
01:26:02,050 --> 01:26:04,510
不 不 不 我們必須繼續往南
No, no, no. We must keep going south,

939
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:05,800
否則你殺了我們全部人
or you'll kill us all.

940
01:26:05,890 --> 01:26:07,350
該死!
Damn it!

941
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:11,220
亞努思 我們快死了
Janusz, we're dying.

942
01:26:11,310 --> 01:26:12,640
我們已經要死了
We're already dying.

943
01:26:12,730 --> 01:26:14,140
停
Stop.

944
01:26:37,630 --> 01:26:39,290
它是個海市蜃樓!
It's a mirage!

945
01:26:40,510 --> 01:26:42,670
它只是個海市蜃樓
It's just a mirage.

946
01:27:14,330 --> 01:27:16,870
海市蜃樓沒有鳥
Mirages don't have birds.

947
01:27:21,590 --> 01:27:23,960
海市蜃樓沒有鳥!
Mirages don't have birds!

948
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:35,810
那是口井!
It's a well!

949
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:55,290
別喝太多 你會生病的
Don't fill yourselves. You'll get sick.

950
01:29:28,930 --> 01:29:30,710
至少這裡我們有水
At least we have water here.

951
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,590
噓 噓 你會吵醒她
Shh. Shh. You'll wake her.

952
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:34,550
是啊 但是沒食物
Yeah, but no food.

953
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:36,550
也許遊牧民族會帶他們的牲畜來喝水
Maybe nomads will come to water their flocks.

954
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:38,350
什麼時候?
When?

955
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:40,350
下周 下月?
Next week, next month?

956
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:43,180
我們應該待這裡至少幾天
We should stay here at least a few more days.

957
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:47,110
注意聽好 沒有食物 我們只會越來越虛弱
Look, without food, we'll only get weaker.

958
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:50,060
然後也許太虛弱了無法旅行
And then maybe too weak to travel.

959
01:29:50,070 --> 01:29:56,440
我不知道 經歷過去幾天之後...
I don't know. After these last days-

960
01:29:56,540 --> 01:29:58,620
我不知道我是否能再經歷一次
I don't know if I can go through that again.

961
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:02,920
找到這口井是個奇?
It was a miracle finding this.

962
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,870
我們能寄望另一個嗎?
Can we count on another?

963
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:07,080
亞努思?
Janusz?

964
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:14,960
好 盡你所能給我倒
Okay, give me your best.

965
01:30:21,310 --> 01:30:22,550
哦!

966
01:30:22,650 --> 01:30:23,930
啊 哈 哈!

967
01:30:24,020 --> 01:30:26,440
等 等 等!
Wait, wait, wait!

968
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:27,730
開始 托馬斯!
Go, Tomasz!

969
01:30:30,780 --> 01:30:32,110
請摘下帽子
Hat, please.

970
01:30:35,740 --> 01:30:37,230
低一點
Lower.

971
01:31:46,230 --> 01:31:48,640
跑! 跑!
Run! Run!

972
01:31:48,730 --> 01:31:51,020
回頭 回頭! 找掩蔽!
Get back, get back! Take cover!

973
01:31:57,030 --> 01:31:58,320
躲在那沙丘後面!
Behind that dune!

974
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:07,920
艾琳娜! 趴下!
Irena! Get down!

975
01:32:10,170 --> 01:32:11,580
別害怕!
Don't be afraid!

976
01:32:21,980 --> 01:32:25,090
艾琳娜
Irena.

977
01:32:25,190 --> 01:32:29,270
艾琳娜

978
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:33,570
曬乾的魚
Sun-dried fish.

979
01:32:33,650 --> 01:32:34,940
謝謝
Thank you.

980
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:39,410
給你
Here.

981
01:32:52,590 --> 01:32:54,550
你能找到我們回井的路嗎?
Can you find our way back to the well?

982
01:32:54,630 --> 01:32:57,470
當然不行
It was way off course.

983
01:32:57,550 --> 01:33:00,290
記得嗎? 我意思是 東邊方向
Remember? I mean, way east.

984
01:33:00,390 --> 01:33:01,880
沒有...
There's no-

985
01:33:01,970 --> 01:33:04,210
這片荒土沒有特徵
There's no features in this wasteland.

986
01:33:04,310 --> 01:33:06,600
我可能永遠找不到
I could never find it.

987
01:33:37,130 --> 01:33:39,170
當我在農田里幫我爸爸
When I helped my father in the fields

988
01:33:39,260 --> 01:33:40,920
在嚴熱夏天期間
during the hot summers,

989
01:33:41,010 --> 01:33:43,170
我們習慣含這樣的小石頭
we used to suck on small stones like these.

990
01:33:43,270 --> 01:33:45,470
讓我們感覺比較不渴
Made us feel less thirsty.

991
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:01,020
亞努思!
Janusz!

992
01:34:21,970 --> 01:34:23,430
中暑?
Sunstroke?

993
01:34:30,850 --> 01:34:32,520
我快變成討厭的人了
I'm becoming a nuisance.

994
01:34:33,940 --> 01:34:37,680
不 不 不
No, no, no.

995
01:34:37,780 --> 01:34:40,520
他們有傷害你嗎?
Do they hurt you?

996
01:34:40,530 --> 01:34:44,650
沒有 一點也沒有
No, not at all.

997
01:34:44,740 --> 01:34:48,080
它們一定腫起來了 因為我已經走太遠了
They must be swelling because I've walked so far.

998
01:34:50,330 --> 01:34:53,240
你不認為嗎 密斯特?
Don't you think, Mister?

999
01:34:53,340 --> 01:34:54,320
是啊
Yes.

1000
01:34:57,210 --> 01:34:58,750
現在你背部躺下來
You lie back down now.

1001
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:00,710
我要替你包?腳
I'm gonna cover your legs up for you.

1002
01:35:20,950 --> 01:35:23,110
艾琳娜 我們可以停一會兒
Irena, we can stop for a while.

1003
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:26,570
不用
No.

1004
01:35:26,660 --> 01:35:28,570
吸吮這個就好
just suck on this.

1005
01:35:48,140 --> 01:35:50,430
不! 拜託 不! 不!
No! Please, no! No!

1006
01:35:50,430 --> 01:35:53,800
噓 噓

1007
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:06,360
來吧 我們必須繼續走
Come on. We've got to keep going.

1008
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:16,950
我名字叫艾琳娜.吉琳斯卡
My name is Irena Zieilnska.

1009
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:19,830
噓

1010
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:21,830
我名字叫艾琳娜.吉琳斯卡
My name is Irena Zieilnska.

1011
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:23,210
噓 噓 噓

1012
01:36:42,110 --> 01:36:44,690
把我放到地上 安德瑞斯
Put me on the ground, Andrejs.

1013
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:50,240
把我放到地上就好
just lay me on the ground.

1014
01:37:57,230 --> 01:37:59,140
沒關係
It's okay.

1015
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:51,310
請主你的天使來接她
Command thine angels to receive her

1016
01:38:51,410 --> 01:38:53,940
並帶她到天堂...
and to take her to heaven-

1017
01:38:53,950 --> 01:38:56,820
她的國度
her country.

1018
01:38:56,910 --> 01:39:02,080
阿門
Amen.

1019
01:41:24,980 --> 01:41:26,970
我真的喜歡這一個
I really like this one.

1020
01:41:27,060 --> 01:41:28,770
你何時畫的?
When did you do that?

1021
01:41:28,860 --> 01:41:31,100
在古拉格第二晚
Second night in the Gulag.

1022
01:41:31,190 --> 01:41:37,400
可憐的卡濟 腳總是有麻煩
Poor Kazik, always in trouble with his feet.

1023
01:41:37,490 --> 01:41:40,950
這是誰?
Who is this?

1024
01:41:41,030 --> 01:41:42,820
你
You.

1025
01:41:42,910 --> 01:41:45,620
看起來像我父親
Looks like my father.

1026
01:41:45,620 --> 01:41:46,950
那個是我現在的樣子嗎?
Is that how I look now?

1027
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:48,330
不
No.

1028
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:50,950
現在你看起來更糟
Now, you look worse.

1029
01:41:56,970 --> 01:41:59,250
你抓住她的笑容
You caught her smile.

1030
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:02,930
看
Look.

1031
01:42:03,010 --> 01:42:06,970
這只是草圖
This is-just a sketch.

1032
01:42:06,980 --> 01:42:09,810
但我會繼續畫它
But I'll work on it.

1033
01:42:09,900 --> 01:42:11,430
我會畫它
I'll do it.

1034
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:14,510
那真是傑出的工作
That's really fine work.

1035
01:42:14,610 --> 01:42:20,320
你是個很棒的藝術家 托馬斯
You're a great artist, Tomasz.

1036
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:22,030
它幾乎就像一張相片
It's almost like a photography.

1037
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:25,320
它是影像
It's the shadow.

1038
01:42:25,410 --> 01:42:27,740
它真的很漂亮
It's really nice.

1039
01:43:05,790 --> 01:43:08,320
我們必須到那些山丘
We have to get to those hills.

1040
01:43:08,410 --> 01:43:12,530
水可能收集在那裡
Water may be trapped there.

1041
01:43:12,540 --> 01:43:16,210
來吧 來吧 起來 起來
Come on. Come on, get up. Get up.

1042
01:43:20,970 --> 01:43:22,830
密斯特

1043
01:43:22,930 --> 01:43:25,760
來吧
Come on.

1044
01:43:25,850 --> 01:43:30,390
留下我繼續走
Go on without me.

1045
01:43:30,390 --> 01:43:31,970
我完了
I'm done.

1046
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:37,010
去吧
Go.

1047
01:43:45,070 --> 01:43:48,360
佐仁...
Zoran...

1048
01:43:48,450 --> 01:43:52,240
你到山丘找水
you go to the hills and look for water.

1049
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:53,700
然後你在那裡等我們
And you wait for us there.

1050
01:43:53,790 --> 01:43:54,780
不
No.

1051
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:55,960
去吧
Yes.

1052
01:43:56,040 --> 01:43:58,330
我們會趕上的
We'll catch up.

1053
01:44:36,540 --> 01:44:37,830
你找到水了嗎?
Did you find water?

1054
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:39,030
沒有
No.

1055
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:20,330
給我看
Show me.

1056
01:45:20,420 --> 01:45:22,630
拜託給我看
Please show me.

1057
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:30,260
在哪裡?
Where-?

1058
01:45:37,190 --> 01:45:38,600
你在哪裡?
Where are you?

1059
01:45:55,580 --> 01:45:56,570
有...
There's-

1060
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:00,030
水!
water!

1061
01:46:38,370 --> 01:46:40,860
佐仁
Zoran.

1062
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:42,370
這附近
Around here.

1063
01:46:57,230 --> 01:46:59,560
看啊?
Look at that, uh?

1064
01:46:59,640 --> 01:47:01,930
要是它有毒呢? 我們怎麼吃它?
What if-if it's poisonous? How can we eat it?

1065
01:47:02,020 --> 01:47:04,060
不 不 不 我們砍掉它的頭
No, no, no, we cut off its head.

1066
01:47:04,150 --> 01:47:06,640
給我刀子
Here. Give me the knife.

1067
01:47:06,730 --> 01:47:09,150
啊 看一下
Ah, look at that.

1068
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:32,970
吃起來像雞肉
Tastes like chicken.

1069
01:47:33,050 --> 01:47:34,710
對
Yeah.

1070
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:37,800
一隻大又黑 有毒的無腳雞
A big, black, poisonous chicken with no legs.

1071
01:47:37,810 --> 01:47:39,470
嗯 不錯
Well, it's not bad.

1072
01:47:42,980 --> 01:47:47,350
你知道嗎 瓦卡談到彼此吃人
You know, Valka talked of eating each other

1073
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:48,980
當我們在西伯利亞時
when we were in Siberia.

1074
01:47:51,450 --> 01:47:52,180
他有說?
He did?

1075
01:47:52,280 --> 01:47:53,690
對
Yes.

1076
01:47:53,780 --> 01:47:56,570
然後? 你會吃我嗎?
And? Would you have eaten me?

1077
01:47:56,660 --> 01:47:59,320
會
Yeah.

1078
01:47:59,330 --> 01:48:01,820
會 當然
Yeah, of course.

1079
01:48:01,830 --> 01:48:03,990
我永遠不會吃你
I would never have eaten you.

1080
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:05,620
這個嘛 為何不會?
Well, why not?

1081
01:48:05,710 --> 01:48:07,250
太多筋和太苦了
Too stringy and bitter.

1082
01:48:07,340 --> 01:48:09,120
我寧可吃蛇
I'd rather eat snake.

1083
01:48:37,030 --> 01:48:38,820
這裡一些水
Here's some water.

1084
01:48:47,290 --> 01:48:49,530
它可能殺了你 記得嗎?
It can kill you, remember?

1085
01:48:49,550 --> 01:48:50,880
什麼?
What?

1086
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:53,710
仁慈
Kindness.

1087
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:56,880
靠泥漿和蛇 你能活多久?
How long can you survive on mud and snakes?

1088
01:48:58,180 --> 01:49:00,220
留我在這裡就好
Just leave me here.

1089
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:06,850
你不能 對吧?
You can't, can you?

1090
01:49:14,490 --> 01:49:15,900
注意聽著 密斯特
Look, Mister-

1091
01:49:15,990 --> 01:49:18,100
什麼?
What?

1092
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:23,360
你知道 我可能不知道你的名字
You know, I may not even know your first name,

1093
01:49:23,450 --> 01:49:25,450
但我 啊...
but I ...

1094
01:49:25,540 --> 01:49:28,030
我知道你兒子的名字
I know your son's name.

1095
01:49:28,130 --> 01:49:30,910
艾琳娜告訴你的?
Irena told you?

1096
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,580
對
Yes.

1097
01:49:37,300 --> 01:49:38,710
我可以說他的名字嗎?
Can I say his name?

1098
01:49:42,010 --> 01:49:43,000
大衛
David.

1099
01:49:45,230 --> 01:49:50,140
說他的名字無法讓他起死回生
Saying his name won't bring him back.

1100
01:49:50,230 --> 01:49:51,600
你打算做的
What are you trying to do,

1101
01:49:51,690 --> 01:49:52,770
是給我活下去的意志嗎?
give me the will to live?

1102
01:49:52,860 --> 01:49:54,270
是那意思嗎?
Is that it?

1103
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:55,980
叫我不要放棄?
Stop me from giving up?

1104
01:49:56,070 --> 01:49:57,810
而你正在放棄?
And are you giving up?

1105
01:49:57,910 --> 01:50:00,400
在集中營裡 有些人視死亡為自由
In the camps, some saw death as freedom.

1106
01:50:00,490 --> 01:50:03,900
那麼為何你不自殺就好?
Then why didn't you just kill yourseif?

1107
01:50:03,990 --> 01:50:06,410
生存是一種抗議
Survival was a kind of protest.

1108
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:09,580
活著是我的懲罰
Being alive was my punishment.

1109
01:50:09,670 --> 01:50:12,000
懲罰什麼?
Punishment for what?

1110
01:50:12,090 --> 01:50:14,750
我帶大衛去蘇聯
I brought David to Russia.

1111
01:50:22,260 --> 01:50:25,680
現在沒人能原諒你
And now no one can forgive you.

1112
01:50:25,770 --> 01:50:28,100
你不能原諒你自己
And you can't forgive yourself.

1113
01:50:30,730 --> 01:50:35,270
艾琳娜告訴我...
Irena told me...

1114
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:37,980
他們折磨你妻子...
that they tortured your wife...

1115
01:50:40,240 --> 01:50:42,730
而她告發你
and she informed on you.

1116
01:50:48,460 --> 01:50:49,950
對
Yes.

1117
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:53,780
他們對我孩子做一樣的事
They did the same thing to my boy.

1118
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:56,710
然後他們在他頭上開了一槍
Then they shot him in the head.

1119
01:51:03,720 --> 01:51:05,550
我妻子還活著
My wife is alive.

1120
01:51:08,270 --> 01:51:09,880
她活著...
She lived-

1121
01:51:09,980 --> 01:51:15,810
而且被釋放了 我知道就那麼多
and was released. That much I know.

1122
01:51:15,900 --> 01:51:18,230
但她永遠不能原諒她自己
But she'll never be able to forgive herseif

1123
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:21,030
對於她所做的事
for what she's done.

1124
01:51:21,030 --> 01:51:24,320
你知道嗎 只有我能做那事
You see, only I can do that.

1125
01:51:24,410 --> 01:51:27,400
她會折磨她自己 就像你一樣
She will be torturing herself, just like you.

1126
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:31,530
因此你明白 我必須回去
So you see, I have to get back.

1127
01:51:31,620 --> 01:51:34,960
我必須回去
I- have-to-get-back.

1128
01:52:02,150 --> 01:52:03,820
亞努思
Janusz.

1129
01:52:12,290 --> 01:52:14,280
打包你的東西 快
Pack your things, quick.

1130
01:53:48,840 --> 01:53:50,380
亞努思!
Janusz!

1131
01:54:36,640 --> 01:54:38,050
你聽到了嗎?
Do you hear that?

1132
01:54:39,270 --> 01:54:40,350
那是什麼?
What is that?

1133
01:55:22,350 --> 01:55:23,640
西藏
Tibet.

1134
01:56:06,270 --> 01:56:07,600
拉薩
Lhasa.

1135
01:56:13,490 --> 01:56:15,150
印度在哪裡?
And where is India?

1136
01:56:15,160 --> 01:56:17,940
嗯

1137
01:56:21,870 --> 01:56:23,160
印度
India.

1138
01:56:59,580 --> 01:57:01,910
印度 是啊
India. Yes.

1139
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:06,530
翻過山有條鐵路到錫金
There is the track to Sikkim, over the mountains.

1140
01:57:06,630 --> 01:57:08,710
很多人去那裡
Many people go there.

1141
01:57:08,790 --> 01:57:10,910
路上有村莊嗎?
Are there villages on the way?

1142
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,040
小村莊 有的
Small villages, yes.

1143
01:57:13,050 --> 01:57:14,880
他們會給你食物
They give you food.

1144
01:57:14,970 --> 01:57:17,210
生火用燃料
Fuel for fire.

1145
01:57:17,220 --> 01:57:19,630
但你們現在不能走
But you can't go now.

1146
01:57:19,720 --> 01:57:21,130
為什麼?
Why?

1147
01:57:21,220 --> 01:57:25,060
如果大雪來 很困難
If big snow comes, very difficult.

1148
01:57:25,060 --> 01:57:29,100
你們等到春天
You wait until spring.

1149
01:57:29,190 --> 01:57:31,480
這個家庭收留你們
This family keep you.

1150
01:57:36,610 --> 01:57:39,360
嗯 我們在冬天不能越過山
Well, we can't cross the mountains in winter.

1151
01:57:39,450 --> 01:57:42,410
他說很難 但不是不可能
He said it was difficult but not impossible.

1152
01:57:42,410 --> 01:57:44,120
亞努思 只有3個月
Janusz, it's only three months.

1153
01:57:44,200 --> 01:57:46,570
注意聽著 我們不能放鬆
Look, we can't let go.

1154
01:57:46,580 --> 01:57:48,320
你是什麼意思?
What do you mean?

1155
01:57:48,420 --> 01:57:52,040
如果我們現在停止 那麼我們就會屈服於疲憊
If we stop now, then we'll give In to exhaustion.

1156
01:57:52,130 --> 01:57:54,250
不 不是屈服
No, it's not giving in.

1157
01:57:54,340 --> 01:57:57,580
我們筋疲力盡了
We are exhausted.

1158
01:57:57,590 --> 01:58:00,430
我會睡到春天 就像熊在洞穴裡
I will sleep till spring like a bear in a cave.

1159
01:58:00,430 --> 01:58:03,760
你可以研究佛經並成為和尚
You can study Buddhism and become a monk.

1160
01:58:03,770 --> 01:58:07,800
但首先你必須學習如何喜歡他們的茶
But first you must learn how to like their tea.

1161
01:58:07,900 --> 01:58:10,230
我已經喜歡上茶了
I already like the tea.

1162
01:58:10,310 --> 01:58:11,600
晚安
Good night.

1163
01:58:15,690 --> 01:58:17,610
你呢 密斯特?

What are you going to do for three or four months?

1165
01:58:23,200 --> 01:58:25,110
我要去拉薩
I'm going to Lhasa.

1166
01:58:25,120 --> 01:58:27,080
我們的朋友已經聯繫

1167
01:58:27,160 --> 01:58:29,250
他認為他能經由中國把我弄出去
He thinks he can get me out through China.

1168
01:58:29,330 --> 01:58:33,950
那裡有個美軍任務
There's a U.S. military mission there.

1169
01:58:33,960 --> 01:58:35,830
先為自己著想
Looking out for number one.

1170
01:58:35,920 --> 01:58:37,790
那不是你們美國人說的嗎?
Isn't that what you Americans say?

1171
01:58:37,800 --> 01:58:39,920
佐仁
Zoran-

1172
01:58:40,010 --> 01:58:41,130
佐仁
Zoran.
