1939年9月 希特勒从西边入侵波兰 几天后史达林从东边入侵
他们瓜分了这个国家

6
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,400
不

7
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,360
带目击者进来

8
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,300
你认识这人吗?

9
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,010
认识

10
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,030

我是他妻子

14
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,680
被告 你能证实这事吗?

15
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,900
是

16
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,710
目击者 关于被告你有什么话要说吗?

17
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:44,720
从他谈话 我知道了他批评党...

18
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:51,570
特别是苏联领导人 史达林同志

19
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,960
他们对你做了什么?

20
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,460
被告 你能证实这些指控吗?

21
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,710
目击者 关于被告你还知道什么?

22
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,560
他为外国势力当间谍

23
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,880
被告 你能证实这事吗?

24
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,900
不是

25
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,470
目击者 你被宽恕了 守卫!

26
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,530
她已经签署了充分完整的声明...

00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,970
详述你的间谍和阴谋破坏活动

28
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,690
现在你会签吗?

29
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,750
你们对她做了什么?

00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,900
1940年 西伯利亚

31
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,040
人民的敌人们

32
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,400
你们四处看看就能了解...

33
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:29,480
不是我们的枪 或狗 或铁丝网 构成你们的监狱

34
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,770
西伯利亚是你们的监狱

35
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:39,150
它所有面积是500万平方英里

36
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:46,950
大自然是你们的枷锁 而且它毫不留情

37
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:56,030
如果大自然没杀了你...当地人会

38
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:03,200
有一项恩惠是给每位逃犯的头的

39
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,670
看那些可怜人
Look at those poor men.

40
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,250
他们得到了夜盲症
They've got night blindness.

41

我在过渡集中营见过

因为饥饿缺乏维生素

00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,590

早上我会活着 他不会
I'll be alive in the morning. He won't.

仁慈

49
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,100
在这里会要了你的命

史达林恨外国人

包括波兰人

00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,200
你是波兰人吗?
You're Polish, no?

55
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,370
啊哈

56
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,330
我喜欢你们波兰人
I like you Poles.

57
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,160
你们打抱不平
Your burning sense of injustice,

58
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,840
渴望自由
the yearning for freedom.

59
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,340
卡巴洛夫.安卓.提摩菲耶维屈

维斯塞克.亚努思

他们是那么告诉我的

00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,220
10年?
Ten years?

66
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,270
不 20年
No. 20.

67
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,400
第58条第14项 破坏罪 10年
58-14. Sabotage. Ten years.

68
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,730
你在苏联边境
And you were on Soviet side of line,

69
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,410
他们逮捕你 控告你间谍罪
and they arrest you. They accuse you of spying.

70
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,870
折磨你 嗯?
Torture you, huh?

71
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,410
你签认罪书了吗?
Did you sign confession?

72
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,900
没有

没有 我不签
No, I wouldn't sign,

74
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,950
所以他们 他们折磨别人
so they-they tortured someone else.

75
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,760
原谅我
Forgive me.

76
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,920
我是位演员

77
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,460
电影
Moving pictures.

78
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:38,220
上次电影 我演贵族
In my last picture, I played aristocrat.

79
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,550
当影片发布时他们逮捕我
They arrested me when the film was released.

80
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,100
为什么?
Why?

81
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,890
它被控诉
it was claimed

82
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:49,440
我在鼓吹旧贵族地位
I was elevating the status of the old nobility.

83
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,990
所以你因为在影片中表演 而被判刑10年
So you got ten years for a performance in a film.

84
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,490
我的公告好一点

85
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,200
不
Nyet.

86
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,760
我继续赊帐

87
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,260
赊帐? 你已经负债中了

88
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,300
乌尔奇帮
The Urki.

89
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:25,140
你知道这些人是谁?
Do you know who these are?

90
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,810
职业犯
Professional criminals.

91
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,140
杀人犯和小偷
Murderers and thieves.

92
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,150
别盯他们看
Don't stare at them.

93
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,650
警卫让他们在这里围事
The guards let them run things in here,

94
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,280
而且他们令人害怕
and they are to be feared.

95
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,110
那么为何他们让他们围事?
Then why would they let them run things?

96
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,190
因为他们是中产阶级的产物
Because they are byproduct of bourgeois society

97
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,280
和所谓人民的朋友
and so friends of people.

98
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:49,490
我们是政治犯和所谓人民的敌人
We are political prisoners and so enemies of people.

99
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:53,050
苏联已经变成一个大监狱

100
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,120
奴役劳工

101
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,340
他们远在苏联帝国之外
They are from far reaches of Soviet Empire,

102
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:02,720
全被抓进相同的铁丝网
all caught up in same net.

103
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,970
啊 他们之中有人设法 逃离这个铁丝网吗?
And, uh, do any of them wriggle out of the net?

104
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,100
没有 亚努思 你必须更小心点
No, Janusz. You must be more careful.

105
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,400
史达林到处有耳目
Stalin has eyes and ears everywhere,

106
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:17,980
甚至在这里面
even in here.

107
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,990
如果你不更小心点
If you are not more careful,

108
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,240
一年后你会死
you will die after one year.

109
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:24,910
即使不是字面上的死
If not literally,

110
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,000
那么就是心死
then spirit.

111
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,750
你在这里面多久了?
And how long have you been in here?

112
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,080
11个月又29天
Eleven months and 29 days.

113
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,800
我要这件毛衣

114
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:49,890
拿这件外套吧

115
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,890
我要毛衣

116
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,620
你祖母做给你的吗?

117
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,380
你在这里没有权力

118
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,000
毛衣

119
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,470
换香肠

120
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:17,210
你替我画
You do for me.

121
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,910
你要我画你?
You want me to draw you?

122
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:21,090
不 不是我
No. Not me.

123
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:26,890
当海盗盯着他时 吉姆身体感到一阵颤抖

124
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,800
他全身是伤疤和刺青

125
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,440
而且他只有一条腿

126
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,570
他说"我是隆.约翰.席尔维" (名著金银岛的海盗船长)

127
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:45,200
我知道一个像那类型的故事 记得伊果吗? 他有一条腿

128
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,260
闭嘴

129
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,670
继续讲 你会获得一些面包的

130
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,950
那么这位隆.约翰.席尔维如何找到宝藏的?

131
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:09,400
因此吉姆与这帮穷凶恶极之徒航向金银岛

132
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:20,320
这些人杀人不眨眼 这些人只爱金子

133
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,120
寄生虫?
Lice?

134
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,950
吃我为生
Eating me alive.

135
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,950
关于那个 我有祖传秘方 过来

136
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,340
矿坑
The mine.

137
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,390
他们晚上炸
They blast at night.

138
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,800
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

139
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:59,140
我们必须快点
We must be quick.

140
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,640
否则在早上这个不会在这里了
Or this will not be here in the morning.

141
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,070
你打算留它在这里过夜? 为什么?
You're going to leave it here overnight? Why?

142
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,730
你会知道的
You'll see.

143
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,670
这事做得到的
It can be done.

144
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,370
我知道穿越铁丝网的办法
I know a way through the wire.

145
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,830
怎么穿越?
How?

146
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,790
拉扎尔 我的同伴
Lazar, my associate,

147
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,880
他是建筑物的监工
he is overseer of construction.

148
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,180
他指给我看的
He showed me.

149
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:40,010
如果你曾想逃离这集中营
If you ever escape the camps,

150
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,140
而我一直等待像你这样的人很久了
and I've been waiting so long for someone like you,

151
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,320
有力量
someone with the strength,

152
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,520
有意志能克服
the will to see it through.

153
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,520
但去哪里?
But to go where?

154
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,700
我意思是 我们不能往西走
I mean, we can't go west.

155
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,490
我意思是 除了德国人外 就是苏联人
I mean, apart from the Germans, there's the Soviets.

156
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,070
而东边 整个苏联直到太平洋
And east, all Soviet right to the Pacific.

157
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,700
不 不 不 不
No, no, no, no.

158
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,370
北边 必须是... 必须是南边
North. Have to be- have to be south.

159
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,170
答对了
Correct.

160
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,870
但你知道我们在哪里吗? 我意思是 确切位置?
But do you know where we are? I mean, exactly?

161
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:12,800
我相信我们大约在 贝加尔湖北方500公里地方
I beileve we are about 500 kilometers north of Lake Baikal.

162
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:15,050
这是湖
This is the lake.

163
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,550
集中营在这里
Camp is here.

164
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,390
边境在这里
And the border is here.

165
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,550
我们可以顺着湖这里的边缘
We could follow the edge of the lake here.

166
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,430
往南
That runs due south.

167
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,890
正是 然后我们穿越西伯利亚大铁路
Exactly. Then we cross the Trans-Siberian Railway

168
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,520
到蒙古边境获得自由
to the Mongolian border and freedom.

169
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:30,270
春天已经来了
Spring is already upon us.

170
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,940
我们必须等到秋天
We will have to wait till autumn.

171
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,240
不 为什么等?
No. Why wait?

172
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,280
为什么?
Why?

173
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:38,080
因为到边境是1000公里 也许更多
Because it is a thousand kilometers to the border, maybe more.

174
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,700
我们需要小心计划 我们需要屯积食物
We need careful planning. We need to stockpile food.

175
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,280
我已经开始交易 分配
I've already begun trading, dealing.

176
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,120
你必须做一样的事
You must do the same.

177
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,920
秋天天气较能预测
And in autumn, the weather is more predictable.

178
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,890
我们可以用新雪掩盖我们的足迹
We can use the new snow to cover our tracks.

179
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,310
还有我们带上我的朋友
And we bring my friends.

180
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,260
你的朋友? 你信任他们?
Your friends? You trust them?

181
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,880
当然
Of course.

182
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,770
他们不会全部生存的
They won't all survive.

183
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,850
但他们死时会是自由人
But they will die free men.

184
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,400
自由
Free.

185
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,720
停

186
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,030
看 天气越来越坏了

187
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,120
我们能怎么办?

188
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,420
你决定

189
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,300
我们会冻死的

190
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,010
我们应该回去

191
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,420
对 然后他们会要我脑袋

192
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:44,900
指挥官 我们即将死在这里

193
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,030
休息

194
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,110
我们会冻死的

195
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,600
我们死定了

196
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,210
蹲到地上

197
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:54,850
蹲下

198
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,650
不到一小时我们就会冻死

199
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,520
如果你现在倒毙 我不会有意见的

200
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,690
对 但损失200人...

201
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,400
你们就得解释一番了

202
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,100
事情可能对你们很糟

203
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,090
蹲到地上

204
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:12,310
我们可以前进森林找掩蔽

205
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,350
蹲到地上

206
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,370
站住

207
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,800
留在你的位置

208
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,280
我会开枪的

209
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,780
那是个真正勇敢的人!
That's a really brave man!

210
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:56,340
让犯人在森林里掩蔽

211
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:02,140
如果他们跑就射杀他们

212
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,170
首先我们需要大树枝!
First we need big branches!

213

00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,270
不 这样就够了
No, it's enough.

304
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,850
亚努思 那是不可能的
Janusz, that is impossible.

305
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:17,190
我们需要...我们需要周详的准备
We need- We need detailed preparation,

306
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,820
我们需要计划 我们需要地图

307
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:20,990
不 不 时机永远不会完美的
No, no, the timing will never be perfect.

308
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,780
看 他们现在没有预期到暴风雪
Look, they won't expect it now.

309
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:24,200
你疯了吗?
Are you crazy?

310
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:26,120
距离呢?
What about the distances, huh?

311
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:28,450
它是...它是1000公里 并且我们需要食物

注意 美国人跟我们一起

我们一直在交易 就像你说的
We've been trading, just like you said.

316
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,170
那能持续多久?
How long will that last?

317
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,550
注意 我已经花费半生
Look, I've spent half my life

318
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,840
在森林和山里
In the woods and mountains.

319
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:41,670
离开这地方我们可以活下去
We can live off the land.

320
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,840
你不明白 你太年轻
You don't understand. You are too young.

321
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:44,890
这事是办不到的
It cannot be done.

322
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,010
还有什么?
What else is there?

323
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,180
你听到我说的吗?
You hear me?

324
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,310
待在这里然后死?
To stay here and die?

325
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,930
这事是办不到的
It cannot be done.

326
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,860
安卓! 我们要如何穿越铁丝网?
Andrei! How do we get through that wire?

327
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,020
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you are talking about.

328
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,060
你的朋友拉扎尔...
Your friend Lazar-

329
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,650
我意思是 他知道不是吗?
I mean, he knows, doesn't he?

330
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,360
是你告诉我的
You told me that.

331
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,800
马上离开
Piss off now.

332
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,520
你看不见对吧?
You can't see, can you?

333
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,220
拜托不要丢下我
Please don't leave me behind.

334
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,850
答应我 安德瑞斯
Promise me, Andrejs.

335
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:38,110
晚上我可以抓住你的肩膀
I can hold onto your shoulder by night.

336
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,610
我可以 我可以看见形状

337

白天我可以刚刚好看见
By day I can see just fine.

338
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:46,080
我不会阻碍你的
I won't hold you up.

339
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,240
拜托不要告诉其他人

340

在这里面我会死

瑞士的
Swiss.

342
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,170
金表

343
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,270
首先你必须停止发电机

344
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,550
灯光会暗下来 可能只有10分钟

345
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,670
那是你的机会

346
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,930
你必须等到最后的哨兵换班

347
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:06,490
这里没有秘密
There are no secrets here.

348
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,160
你要做什么?
What do you want?

349
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,660
游戏我输了
The game goes against me.

350
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:13,780
小债 他们剁手指
Small debt, they take fingers.

351
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,490
大债 他们砍头

352

我 大债
Me, big debt.

353
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,500
但我永远不会赌我的狼
But I never gambie my Wolf.

354
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,050
在森林里 你需要刀子
In forest, you need knife,

355
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,670
而我需要奇? 带我离开这里
and I need miracle. Get me out of here.

356
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,260
他们砍断了柱子

357
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,660
我看不见

358
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:09,350
那里! 铁丝网被剪断了

359
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:15,960
放狗

360

来吧! 来吧!
Come on! Come on!

361
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,800
小心! 继续走 继续走!

00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,590
动起来 否则我们马上会死

365
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:59,930
你知道狗跑得多快
You know how fast the dogs are.

366
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,650

到了我背你的时候吗?
Is it time for me to carry you?

369
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,730
来吧 来吧

370
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,190
来吧!
Come on!

371
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:17,290
亚努思 我们看不见东西!
Janusz, we can't see anything!

372
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:20,240
雪让我们看不见!
The snow is blinding us!

373
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,000
亚努思!
Janusz!

374
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,050

亚努思 我们必须找掩蔽!
Janusz, we must take shelter!

378
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:52,360
我们无法继续下去!
We can't go on!

379
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:55,490
你不明白吗? 这太完美了!
Don't you see? This is perfect!

380
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,160
像这样他们永远不会发现我们
They'll never find us like this.

381
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,400
永远不会!
Never!

382
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,980
你盯着我像是蛇盯着兔子

面包换语言 不是吗 牛仔?

我们已经来到多远?

也许20 30公里

就那样?
That's all?

389
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,330
更少 如果我们一直绕圈子的话
Less, if we've been going in circles

390
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,260
像无头鸡一样

391
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:58,680
好吧 我们看看有什么
All right, let's see what we have.

那件外套
And that coat.

398
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,070
它不是你的外套
It's not your coat.

399
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,200
那是卡巴洛夫的外套

对 他给我的

00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:48,180
一切没事
Everything okay.

407
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,610
你和魔鬼做了交易

你有刀吗?

你应该感激 你毕竟在这里

感激是给狗的

414
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:31,310
是什么... 那是什么?
What- What's that?

415

什么是帕坎?

00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,240
乌尔奇帮的老大
Boss of Urki.

423
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,530
我们不是罪犯
We are not criminals.

00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,900
我们脱离了罪犯
We are escaping from criminals.

425

我一直在注视你

我向上帝发誓 你赢得我的尊敬

包括你的手杖和松果

在你面临生死之际 我会为你挺身而出

所以你想当我的保镳?

430

这是Urka的方式

431

你有我 而且你有这只狼

432
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:23,750
嗯?

00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:26,260
亚努思 我们到达湖要多久?

437
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:43,450
我猜我们在这里某处

下去这里 西伯利亚大铁路

蒙古似乎很远

441

我们移动太快 等不及陷阱

我们找农场 村庄那里取得食物

Look, there's a bounty on our heads. Remember that.

我们晚上偷 他们永远不会知道

那么我会偷 而且我会吃

吃鱼?

我从矿坑来找你

我以为我是独自一人

那不是很了不起吗?

486
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:43,910
上帝 安息这个无辜的灵魂吧

直到她确认我们不是苏联人

575
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:06,830
她想跟我们一起旅行吗?

597
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,660
肥皂准备好了吗?

598
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:49,980
对
Yes.

599
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,490
啊 很好
Ah, good.

600
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:53,120
搅拌

601
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:06,710
那个?

602

什么事那么好笑?
What's so funny?

603
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:11,010
你...

605
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:34,740
瓦卡?

606
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:35,870
瓦卡

607
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,070

瓦卡 来吧!

610
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:50,760
现在脱掉你的衬衫
Now take off your shirt.

611
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:55,130
我们为何做这事?
Why do we do this?

612
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:59,440
那么我们不会看起来 像是小偷和强盗
So we don't look like thieves and robbers.

613
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:02,050
头抬起来
Head up.

614
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:07,140
现在别动
Now, still.

615
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:10,940
千万别动 拜托
Very still, please.

616
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:12,400
头抬起来
Head up.

617
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:14,990
再抬高一点
More.

618
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:19,360
不
Nyet.

619
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:06,830
你知道吗 我啊 不相信她是波兰人
You know, I, uh, can't beiieve she's Polish.

620
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,880
她啊 她受过教育
She's, uh, she's educated.

621
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:11,000
会说流利英语 法语
Speaks good English, French.

622
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:12,670
那样对吗?
Is that right?

623
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,670
你不喜欢她吗?
You don't like her, do you?

624
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,340
跟瓦卡谈到她
Speak to Valka about her.

625
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:18,260
他甚至不认为她是波兰人
He doesn't even think she's Polish.

626
00:58:18,350 --> 00:58:19,560
嗯 我的确和他谈过
Well, I did speak to him.

627
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:21,300
还有其他人

628
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,850
他们都赞成她跟我们一起来
They agree she comes with us.

629
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,350
怎么 你不赞成?
What, you disagree?

630
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:30,480
没有多愁善感的余地了 你知道的
There's no room for sentimentality, you know that.

631
00:58:30,570 --> 00:58:33,440
撇开食物不说 她会拖慢我们的速度
Apart from food, she'll slow us down.

632
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:04,230
不 它无法承担我们的重量
No, it won't take our weight.

633
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:06,050
我们必须游泳过去
We'll have to swim across.

634
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:12,100
你会游吗?
Can you swim?

635
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,610
会 密斯特
Yes, Mister.

636
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:16,190
你不会骗我吧
You wouldn't lie to me.

637
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:17,520
我没说谎 同志
I'm not lying, Comrade.

638
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:19,570
别叫我同志
And don't call me Comrade.

639
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:29,910
艾琳娜 不要!
Irena, no!

640
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:57,570
这里 来吧
Here, come on.

641
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,030
这里 拿着食物
Here, take the food.

642
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:18,170
你父母和你一起被逮捕吗?
Were your parents arrested with you?

643
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:20,250
他们死了
They're dead.

644
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:23,130
我们住在华沙外的农场
We lived on a farm outside Warsaw.

645
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:24,840
当苏联人来时
When the Russians came,

646
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:26,470
他们说我们是富农
they said we were kulaks

647
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:28,850
而且剥削农人
and exploiting the peasants.

648
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:33,480
我父母害怕并把我藏在谷仓内
My parents were afraid and hid me in the barn.

649
01:00:33,490 --> 01:00:35,820
我之后发现他们
I found them later.

650
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:46,820
我...
I-

651
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:53,830
我发现他们脸部向下倒在泥浆中
I found them face-down in the mud.

652
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:58,760
他们被殴打并被带刺的铁丝网勒死
They'd been bashed and strangled with barbed wire.

653
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:07,510
之后 苏联人抓到我
Later, the Russians caught me

654
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:11,970
然后送我去一个集中农场
and sent me to a collective farm.

655
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:14,480
他们对我很残酷
They were cruel to me.

656
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:17,180
我逃离了
I ran away.

657
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,360
我没有食物
I had no food.

658
01:01:19,450 --> 01:01:21,480
然后我看到你们
And then I saw you.

659
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:31,580
你不会游泳吗?
You can't swim, can you?

660
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,460
什么?
What?

661
01:01:36,550 --> 01:01:38,210
你一生中从未接近过水
You've never been near the water in your life.

662
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,880
但我过去了不是吗? 而且你跟随
But I got across, didn't I? And you followed.

663
01:01:40,890 --> 01:01:44,220
你说你住在靠近华沙的一个农场?
And you said you lived on a farm near Warsaw?

664
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:45,510
对
Yes.

665
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,090
苏联不会到那么远
Soviets didn't get that far.

666
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:51,720
那是德国领土
That was German territory.

667
01:01:51,810 --> 01:01:55,180
你父母没被杀害对吧?
Your parents weren't murdered, were they?

668
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,520
你虚构了所有的事
You made all that up.

669
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:04,110
我们可都做了可怕的事以求生存
We've all done terrible things to survives.

670
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,320
因此不要再对我说谎
But don't ever lie to me again.

671
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,290
我们已经受够了谎话
We've had enough of lies.

672
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:28,970
我们必须绕过去
We have to go around it.

673
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:31,300
快点通过它
Quicker through it.

674
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,260
不 他们有狗
No, they have dogs.

675
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:35,770
如果他们鸣警铃 那么我们就没希望了
If they raise the alarm, then we don't stand a chance.

676
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:37,640
我们再度需要食物 帕坎
We need food again, Pakhan.

677
01:02:37,730 --> 01:02:39,470
看好 我知道我们需要食物
Look, I know we need food,

678
01:02:39,570 --> 01:02:41,900
但我们不能走进那个镇冒险被捕
but we can't go into that town and risk arrest.

679
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:43,400
我们在浪费时间
We're wasting time.

680
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:02,460
怎么了? 什么问题?
What is it? What's wrong?

681
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:03,960
瓦卡在哪里?
Where's Valka?

682
01:03:03,970 --> 01:03:05,460
他在佐仁后面
He was behind Zoran.

683
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:07,670
佐仁 你没看着他吗?
Zoran, weren't you watching him?

684
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:11,850
我不是他的监护人
I'm not his keeper.

685
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:13,550
该死的他
Damn him.

686
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:15,640
他可能为了奖赏改变了我们命运
He could turn us in for the bounty.

687
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:16,940
还有冒险被捕?
And risk arrest?

688
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:19,310
他是个赌徒
He's a gambler.

689
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:22,610
艾琳娜 你想他会那么做吗?
Irena, do you think he would do that?

690
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:23,900
他可能会
He might.

691
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:25,350
我们不需要他的刀子
We don't need his knife.

692
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:27,360
我们可以从鹿的骨头做一个
We can make one out of deer bone.

693
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:29,570
这是个摆脱他的机会
It's an opportunity to get rid of him.

694
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:34,040
好吧 好吧
All right, all right.

695
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:35,710
来吧 我们走
Come on, let's go.

696
01:03:35,790 --> 01:03:38,000
当心点好笑的人?
Watch it funny man?

697
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,490
嘿 嘿 嘿!
Hey, hey, hey!

698
01:03:39,590 --> 01:03:42,170
你想让我们都被杀吗? 嗯?
You want to get us all killed? Hmm?

699
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:44,670
嗯?

700
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:48,010
放轻松 牛仔
Easy, cowboy.

701
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:50,880
你撕破我的外套
You tear my coat.

702
01:03:50,970 --> 01:03:51,960
白痴
Idiot.

703
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:55,520
白痴? 哈
Idlot? Ha.

704
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,940
是我吗?
Am I?

705
01:03:57,020 --> 01:03:58,850
我们看谁是白痴
Let's see who is idiot.

706
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:05,060
怎么?
What?

707
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:06,320
我杀了?
Did I kill?

708
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:09,690
对
Yes.

709
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:11,190
一只狗
A dog.

710
01:04:11,290 --> 01:04:14,030
不相信我就不要吃
Don't believe me, then don't eat.

711
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:18,910
但你们会吃的不是吗 因为你们想生存
But you will, won't you, because you want to survive.

712
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,834
我一辈子都知道生存
I know about survive.

713
01:04:20,884 --> 01:04:24,672
All my life.

714
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:27,370
还有...
And-

715
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:29,220
今天是我的生日
it's my birthday.

716
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:32,720
在苏联 那意谓我们要喝酒
In Russia, that means we drink.

717
01:05:21,570 --> 01:05:26,360
她住在街上 像我一样
She lived in the streets, like me.

718
01:05:28,610 --> 01:05:30,900
所以你告诉我们的故事不是真的
So the story you told us wasn't true.

719
01:05:30,990 --> 01:05:32,950
我以为那故事会比较悲伤
I thought that story would be more sad

720
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:34,820
你们不会把我丢下不管
and you wouldn't leave me behind.

721
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:45,920
我父母是波兰共产党员
My parents were Polish Communists.

722
01:05:46,010 --> 01:05:50,630
他们带我们住在苏联莫斯科
They took us to live in Soviet Union, to Moscow.

723
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:53,250
他们想从事革命
They want to work for the Revolution.

724
01:05:55,390 --> 01:05:57,630
我们住在卢克斯旅馆
We lived in the Hotel Lux,

725
01:05:57,730 --> 01:06:00,840
和许多外国共产党员一起
with lots of foreign Communists.

726
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:07,480
但他们在1937年逮捕他们
But they arrested them in 1937.

727
01:06:07,570 --> 01:06:09,030
他们说他们是间谍
They said they were spies.

728
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:14,820
他们的人在孤儿院抓到我
The people pot me in the orphanage.

729
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:16,450
和我弟弟
And my brother,

730
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:18,620
他死了
he died.

731
01:06:18,710 --> 01:06:20,700
我当时10岁
I was ten years old.

732
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:28,210
他们叫我莉可
They called me Rykov,

733
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:36,300
但我记得我们的波兰名字...吉琳斯卡
but I remembered our Polish name- Zielinska.

734
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:42,510
每晚我睡觉前习惯说这名字
I used to say it every night before I went to sleep.

735
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:43,890
所以你逃跑了
So you ran away.

736
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:49,430
喔

737
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:21,600
他们没蚊子
They have no mosquitoes.

738
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:27,850
我们能怎么做?
What can we do?

739
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:29,680
偷艘船?
Steal a boat?

740
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:31,390
不 太冒险了
No, it's too risky.

741
01:07:31,490 --> 01:07:33,600
我们的人快要得病了

01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:39,200
我们遭遇所有事之后
After all we've faced,

745
01:07:39,290 --> 01:07:42,370
这些小虫可能击倒我们

746
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:54,880
在那里又一次

你没有彼此交谈吗?
Don't you talk to each other?

775
01:09:35,110 --> 01:09:38,900
在集中营里你学会尽可能少说话
In the camps you learn to say as little as possible.

776
01:09:38,990 --> 01:09:40,570

我们能从其他地方穿越吗?

这里 这是主干道

792

每个地方都会像这个一样

794
01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:33,300

我意思是 他们应该在你屁股上

801
01:11:52,410 --> 01:11:54,830
每次你大便时 你就坐在他们上面

802
01:11:54,830 --> 01:11:56,540

然后他两者都拿

你知道他们...他们会抓你

817
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:42,440
然而有许多的监狱

818
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:43,680
他们找不到我
they don't find me.

819
01:13:46,530 --> 01:13:49,390
美国怎么办?
What about America?

820
01:13:49,490 --> 01:13:53,610
哦 它不适合我 自由

821
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:56,360
我不知道怎么面对 我发誓
I wouldn't know what to do with it, I swear to God.

822
01:13:59,370 --> 01:14:06,120
所以我们必须说再见了 我的狼和我
So we must say goodbye, my Wolf and me.

823

你不再需要他了

828
01:15:10,650 --> 01:15:12,230
会 我是这么想的

829
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,150

838
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:21,880
无处可躲
There's nowhere to hide.

839
01:16:38,910 --> 01:16:40,570
它是个佛教庙宇
It's a Buddhist temple.

840
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:43,240
他们可能接纳我们
They might take us in.

841
01:16:43,330 --> 01:16:45,790
他们也可能和政权一起工作

842
01:16:45,870 --> 01:16:48,080
这是个赌注

843
01:17:44,310 --> 01:17:46,840
这里发生什么事了?
What happened here?

844
01:17:46,850 --> 01:17:49,390
和在苏联发生的事一样

848
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:12,820
他们来到我在拉脱维亚的教会
They came to my church, in Latvia.

849
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:15,130
毁损每样东西 很像这座庙宇
Destroyed everything, much like this.

850
01:18:20,510 --> 01:18:23,750
之后那晚我回去了
I went back later that night,

851
01:18:23,850 --> 01:18:26,510
有一个孤独...孤独的守卫

852
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:30,340
只是一个男孩
Just a boy.

853
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:32,220
然后我勒死他
And I strangled him

854
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:35,270
直到他的眼睛爆出他的头
until his eyes popped right out of his head.

855
01:18:44,990 --> 01:18:48,910
不知瓦卡怎么知道的
Valka knew somehow.

856
01:18:48,910 --> 01:18:51,450
他知道我冷血杀人
He knew I'd killed in cold blood.

857
01:19:01,510 --> 01:19:02,870
中国距离多远?

858
01:19:02,970 --> 01:19:04,580
我不知道
I don't know.

01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:08,920
也许往南五 六百公里

861
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:13,380

我只知道那么多

864
01:19:15,940 --> 01:19:17,810
中国之后是西藏
After China is Tibet.

865
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:20,730
我们可以去首都拉萨
We could go to Lhasa, the capital.

866
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:38,080
什么? 你在说什么?

867
01:19:38,170 --> 01:19:39,960
他们说我们可以经过西藏

868
01:19:40,050 --> 01:19:41,580
越过高山到印度

873
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:50,460
越过喜马拉雅山?

874
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:54,180
怎么过? 坐魔毯吗?

875
01:19:54,270 --> 01:19:56,480
怎么过?
How?

来吧 起床
Come on, wake up.

879
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:33,680
我正好美梦之中
I was in the middle of this beautiful dream.

880
01:20:33,770 --> 01:20:36,180
我正要吃些盐

881

我只是想回去那个梦里
I just want to go back to that dream.

883

这是非常简单的食谱

885
01:20:46,070 --> 01:20:47,690
和一撮肉豆蔻

886
01:20:47,780 --> 01:20:50,190
肉豆蔻? 盐怎么办?
Nutmeg? What about the salt?

887
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:52,240
不 我们会...我们会说到的 现在...
No, we'll-we'll get to that. Now-

888
01:20:52,330 --> 01:20:53,410
加点油...
add the oil-

889
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:54,780
嗯嗯

890
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:56,200
然后你将它放进去腌
and you leave it to marinate

891
01:20:56,290 --> 01:20:57,660
当你的鸡准备好时
while you prepare the chicken.

892
01:20:57,750 --> 01:20:58,490
这地方放盐进来
This is where the salt comes in.

893
01:20:58,580 --> 01:21:00,120
很好
Good.

894
01:21:00,210 --> 01:21:01,870
你把它抹在鸡的表皮上
You rub it into the skin of the chicken

895
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:03,420
加点辣椒粉
with a little bit of the paprika.

896
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:05,040
但是双倍的盐
But double the salt.

897
01:21:05,130 --> 01:21:06,540
注意 你不能只放双倍的盐
Look, you cannot just doubie the sait.

898
01:21:06,630 --> 01:21:08,090
那样会太咸了
It'll be too salty then.

899
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:09,880
我不在乎 就放双倍的盐
I don't care, just doubie the sait.

900
01:21:09,890 --> 01:21:11,720
我不打算破坏它
I'm not going to ruin it.

901
01:21:11,810 --> 01:21:13,420
放双倍的盐就好 拜托
just double the salt, please.

902
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:14,880
不行
No.

903
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:16,010
托马斯...
Tomasz-

904
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:17,140
不行
No.

905
01:21:26,990 --> 01:21:28,440
好了 好了 大家保持安静
All right, all right. Everybody keep calm.

906
01:21:28,530 --> 01:21:29,090
噢 我的天!
Oh, my God!

907
01:21:29,090 --> 01:21:33,242
不 不 不! 别跑! 别跑
No, no, no! Don't run! Don't run.

908
01:21:33,330 --> 01:21:35,490
保持镇定和微笑 很友善的
Be calm and smile. Be friendly.

909
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:42,290
嘿 喔! 喔!
Hey, whoa! Whoa!

910
01:21:42,380 --> 01:21:43,710
大家微笑
Everybody smile.

911
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:46,360
哈罗 哈罗
Hello. Hello.

912
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:48,980
苏联人

913
01:21:49,110 --> 01:21:50,940
不 美国人

914
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:54,040
你去拉萨吗?

915
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:56,490
拉萨 对 西藏

916
01:21:56,740 --> 01:21:57,420
朝圣

917
01:21:57,850 --> 01:21:58,480
对

918
01:21:59,010 --> 01:22:00,260
没马吗?

919
01:22:01,030 --> 01:22:04,610
我们太穷了没马

920
01:22:05,150 --> 01:22:06,120
妻子?

921
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:08,700
不 女儿

922
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:50,070
有水吗?

923
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:40,200
那是南方
That's south.

924
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:17,360
我们打算吃那个吗?
Are we going to eat that?

925
01:24:17,450 --> 01:24:20,360
要嘛这个 或是鱼
It's either this or fish.

926
01:24:26,290 --> 01:24:28,370
看起来像是鸟巢
It looks like a bird's nest.

927
01:24:28,460 --> 01:24:30,700
它能为你遮蔽阳光
It will protect you from the sun.

928
01:24:35,630 --> 01:24:37,970
艾琳娜 试试你的脚
Irena, try this for your feet.

929
01:25:24,430 --> 01:25:26,140
南方
South.

930
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:28,130
来吧 我们继续走
Come on, we keep going.

931
01:25:45,290 --> 01:25:47,780
不 它是另一个海市蜃楼
No, it's another mirage.

932
01:25:47,870 --> 01:25:49,080
我们没有水
We have no water.

933
01:25:50,630 --> 01:25:52,120
那里有树
There's trees there.

934
01:25:52,210 --> 01:25:56,000
如果有树 就有水
If there's trees, there-there's water.

935
01:25:56,010 --> 01:25:57,370
不 我不在乎
No, I don't care.

936
01:25:57,470 --> 01:25:59,330
那是东方 我们要往南
It's east. We're going south.

937
01:25:59,430 --> 01:26:01,960
但是 亚努思 我们必须试一下
But, Janusz, we've got to give it a try.

938
01:26:02,050 --> 01:26:04,510
不 不 不 我们必须继续往南
No, no, no. We must keep going south,

939
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:05,800
否则你杀了我们全部人
or you'll kill us all.

940
01:26:05,890 --> 01:26:07,350
该死!
Damn it!

941
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:11,220
亚努思 我们快死了
Janusz, we're dying.

942
01:26:11,310 --> 01:26:12,640
我们已经要死了
We're already dying.

943
01:26:12,730 --> 01:26:14,140
停
Stop.

944
01:26:37,630 --> 01:26:39,290
它是个海市蜃楼!
It's a mirage!

945
01:26:40,510 --> 01:26:42,670
它只是个海市蜃楼
It's just a mirage.

946
01:27:14,330 --> 01:27:16,870
海市蜃楼没有鸟
Mirages don't have birds.

947
01:27:21,590 --> 01:27:23,960
海市蜃楼没有鸟!
Mirages don't have birds!

948
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:35,810
那是口井!
It's a well!

949
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:55,290
别喝太多 你会生病的
Don't fill yourselves. You'll get sick.

950
01:29:28,930 --> 01:29:30,710
至少这里我们有水
At least we have water here.

951
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,590
嘘 嘘 你会吵醒她
Shh. Shh. You'll wake her.

952
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:34,550
是啊 但是没食物
Yeah, but no food.

953
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:36,550
也许游牧民族会带他们的牲畜来喝水
Maybe nomads will come to water their flocks.

954
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:38,350
什么时候?
When?

955
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:40,350
下周 下月?
Next week, next month?

956
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:43,180
我们应该待这里至少几天
We should stay here at least a few more days.

957
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:47,110
注意听好 没有食物 我们只会越来越虚弱
Look, without food, we'll only get weaker.

958
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:50,060
然后也许太虚弱了无法旅行
And then maybe too weak to travel.

959
01:29:50,070 --> 01:29:56,440
我不知道 经历过去几天之后...
I don't know. After these last days-

960
01:29:56,540 --> 01:29:58,620
我不知道我是否能再经历一次
I don't know if I can go through that again.

961
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:02,920
找到这口井是个奇?
It was a miracle finding this.

962
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,870
我们能寄望另一个吗?
Can we count on another?

963
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:07,080
亚努思?
Janusz?

964
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:14,960
好 尽你所能给我倒
Okay, give me your best.

965
01:30:21,310 --> 01:30:22,550
哦!

966
01:30:22,650 --> 01:30:23,930

967
01:30:24,020 --> 01:30:26,440
等 等 等!
Wait, wait, wait!

968
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:27,730

Go, Tomasz!

969
01:30:30,780 --> 01:30:32,110
请摘下帽子
Hat, please.

970
01:30:35,740 --> 01:30:37,230
低一点
Lower.

971
01:31:46,230 --> 01:31:48,640
跑! 跑!
Run! Run!

972
01:31:48,730 --> 01:31:51,020
回头 回头! 找掩蔽!
Get back, get back! Take cover!

973
01:31:57,030 --> 01:31:58,320
躲在那沙丘后面!
Behind that dune!

974
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:07,920
艾琳娜! 趴下!
Irena! Get down!

975
01:32:10,170 --> 01:32:11,580
别害怕!
Don't be afraid!

976
01:32:21,980 --> 01:32:25,090
艾琳娜
Irena.

977
01:32:25,190 --> 01:32:29,270
艾琳娜

978
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:33,570
晒干的鱼
Sun-dried fish.

979
01:32:33,650 --> 01:32:34,940
谢谢
Thank you.

980
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:39,410
给你
Here.

981
01:32:52,590 --> 01:32:54,550
你能找到我们回井的路吗?
Can you find our way back to the well?

982
01:32:54,630 --> 01:32:57,470
当然不行
It was way off course.

983
01:32:57,550 --> 01:33:00,290
记得吗? 我意思是 东边方向
Remember? I mean, way east.

984
01:33:00,390 --> 01:33:01,880
没有...
There's no-

985
01:33:01,970 --> 01:33:04,210
这片荒土没有特征
There's no features in this wasteland.

986
01:33:04,310 --> 01:33:06,600
我可能永远找不到
I could never find it.

987
01:33:37,130 --> 01:33:39,170
当我在农田里帮我爸爸
When I helped my father in the fields

988
01:33:39,260 --> 01:33:40,920
在严热夏天期间
during the hot summers,

989
01:33:41,010 --> 01:33:43,170
我们习惯含这样的小石头
we used to suck on small stones like these.

990
01:33:43,270 --> 01:33:45,470
让我们感觉比较不渴
Made us feel less thirsty.

991
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:01,020
亚努思!
Janusz!

992
01:34:21,970 --> 01:34:23,430
中暑?
Sunstroke?

993
01:34:30,850 --> 01:34:32,520
我快变成讨厌的人了
I'm becoming a nuisance.

994
01:34:33,940 --> 01:34:37,680
不 不 不
No, no, no.

995
01:34:37,780 --> 01:34:40,520
他们有伤害你吗?
Do they hurt you?

996
01:34:40,530 --> 01:34:44,650
没有 一点也没有
No, not at all.

997
01:34:44,740 --> 01:34:48,080
它们一定肿起来了 因为我已经走太远了
They must be swelling because I've walked so far.

998
01:34:50,330 --> 01:34:53,240
你不认为吗 密斯特?
Don't you think, Mister?

999
01:34:53,340 --> 01:34:54,320
是啊
Yes.

1000
01:34:57,210 --> 01:34:58,750
现在你背部躺下来
You lie back down now.

1001
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:00,710
我要替你包?脚
I'm gonna cover your legs up for you.

1002
01:35:20,950 --> 01:35:23,110
艾琳娜 我们可以停一会儿
Irena, we can stop for a while.

1003
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:26,570
不用
No.

1004
01:35:26,660 --> 01:35:28,570
吸吮这个就好
just suck on this.

1005
01:35:48,140 --> 01:35:50,430
不! 拜托 不! 不!
No! Please, no! No!

1006
01:35:50,430 --> 01:35:53,800
嘘 嘘

1007
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:06,360
来吧 我们必须继续走
Come on. We've got to keep going.

1008

我名字叫艾琳娜.吉琳斯卡
My name is Irena Zieilnska.

1009
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:19,830

把我放到地上 安德瑞斯
Put me on the ground, Andrejs.

1013
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:50,240
把我放到地上就好
just lay me on the ground.

1014
01:37:57,230 --> 01:37:59,140
没关系
It's okay.

1015
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:51,310
请主你的天使来接她
Command thine angels to receive her

1016
01:38:51,410 --> 01:38:53,940
并带她到天堂...

她的国度
her country.

1018
01:38:56,910 --> 01:39:02,080

1021

在古拉格第二晚

1022

可怜的卡济 脚总是有麻烦

但我会继续画它

1033
01:42:09,900 --> 01:42:11,430
我会画它

那真是杰出的工作

你是个很棒的艺术家 托马斯

它几乎就像一张相片
It's almost like a photography.

1037
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:25,320
它是影像
It's the shadow.

1038
01:42:25,410 --> 01:42:27,740
它真的很漂亮
It's really nice.

1039
01:43:05,790 --> 01:43:08,320
我们必须到那些山丘
We have to get to those hills.

1040
01:43:08,410 --> 01:43:12,530
水可能收集在那里

1047
01:43:45,070 --> 01:43:48,360

你到山丘找水

然后你在那里等我们

1051
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:55,960

这附近
Around here.

1063
01:46:57,230 --> 01:46:59,560
看啊?
Look at that, uh?

1064
01:46:59,640 --> 01:47:01,930
要是它有毒呢? 我们怎么吃它?
What if-if it's poisonous? How can we eat it?

1065
01:47:02,020 --> 01:47:04,060
不 不 不 我们砍掉它的头

Ah, look at that.

1068
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:32,970
吃起来像鸡肉
Tastes like chicken.

1069
01:47:33,050 --> 01:47:34,710
对
Yeah.

01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:37,800
一只大又黑 有毒的无脚鸡
A big, black, poisonous chicken with no legs.

1071
01:47:37,810 --> 01:47:39,470
嗯 不错
Well, it's not bad.

1072
01:47:42,980 --> 01:47:47,350
你知道吗 瓦卡谈到彼此吃人
You know, Valka talked of eating each other

1073
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:48,980
当我们在西伯利亚时

1074

1075
01:47:52,280 --> 01:47:53,690

我永远不会吃你

1080
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:05,620
这个嘛 为何不会?
Well, why not?

1081
01:48:05,710 --> 01:48:07,250
太多筋和太苦了
Too stringy and bitter.

1082
01:48:07,340 --> 01:48:09,120
我宁可吃蛇
I'd rather eat snake.

1083
01:48:37,030 --> 01:48:38,820
这里一些水
Here's some water.

1084
01:48:47,290 --> 01:48:49,530
它可能杀了你 记得吗?

1085
01:48:49,550 --> 01:48:50,880
什么?
What?

01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:53,710
仁慈

1087
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:56,880
靠泥浆和蛇 你能活多久?
How long can you survive on mud and snakes?

1088
01:48:58,180 --> 01:49:00,220
留我在这里就好
Just leave me here.

1089
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:06,850
你不能 对吧?
You can't, can you?

1090
01:49:14,490 --> 01:49:15,900
注意听着 密斯特
Look, Mister-

1091
01:49:15,990 --> 01:49:18,100
什么?
What?

1092
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:23,360
你知道 我可能不知道你的名字
You know, I may not even know your first name,

1093
01:49:23,450 --> 01:49:25,450
但我 啊...
but I ...

1094
01:49:25,540 --> 01:49:28,030
我知道你儿子的名字
I know your son's name.

1095
01:49:28,130 --> 01:49:30,910
艾琳娜告诉你的?
Irena told you?

1096
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,580
对
Yes.

1097
01:49:37,300 --> 01:49:38,710
我可以说他的名字吗?
Can I say his name?

1098
01:49:42,010 --> 01:49:43,000
大卫
David.

1099
01:49:45,230 --> 01:49:50,140
说他的名字无法让他起死回生
Saying his name won't bring him back.

1100
01:49:50,230 --> 01:49:51,600
你打算做的
What are you trying to do,

1101
01:49:51,690 --> 01:49:52,770
是给我活下去的意志吗?

1102
01:49:52,860 --> 01:49:54,270
是那意思吗?
Is that it?

1103
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:55,980
叫我不要放弃?
Stop me from giving up?

1104
01:49:56,070 --> 01:49:57,810
而你正在放弃?
And are you giving up?

1105
01:49:57,910 --> 01:50:00,400
在集中营里 有些人视死亡为自由
In the camps, some saw death as freedom.

1106
01:50:00,490 --> 01:50:03,900
那么为何你不自杀就好?
Then why didn't you just kill yourseif?

1107
01:50:03,990 --> 01:50:06,410
生存是一种抗议
Survival was a kind of protest.

1108
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:09,580
活着是我的惩罚
Being alive was my punishment.

1109
01:50:09,670 --> 01:50:12,000
惩罚什么?
Punishment for what?

1110
01:50:12,090 --> 01:50:14,750
我带大卫去苏联

1111
01:50:22,260 --> 01:50:25,680
现在没人能原谅你
And now no one can forgive you.

1112
01:50:25,770 --> 01:50:28,100
你不能原谅你自己
And you can't forgive yourself.

1113
01:50:30,730 --> 01:50:35,270
艾琳娜告诉我...
Irena told me...

1114
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:37,980
他们折磨你妻子...
that they tortured your wife...

1115
01:50:40,240 --> 01:50:42,730
而她告发你
and she informed on you.

1116
01:50:48,460 --> 01:50:49,950
对
Yes.

1117
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:53,780
他们对我孩子做一样的事
They did the same thing to my boy.

1118
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:56,710
然后他们在他头上开了一枪
Then they shot him in the head.

1119
01:51:03,720 --> 01:51:05,550
我妻子还活着
My wife is alive.

1120
01:51:08,270 --> 01:51:09,880
她活着...
She lived-

1121
01:51:09,980 --> 01:51:15,810
而且被释放了 我知道就那么多
and was released. That much I know.

1122
01:51:15,900 --> 01:51:18,230
但她永远不能原谅她自己
But she'll never be able to forgive herseif

1123
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:21,030
对于她所做的事
for what she's done.

1124
01:51:21,030 --> 01:51:24,320
你知道吗 只有我能做那事
You see, only I can do that.

1125
01:51:24,410 --> 01:51:27,400
她会折磨她自己 就像你一样
She will be torturing herself, just like you.

1126
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:31,530
因此你明白 我必须回去
So you see, I have to get back.

1127
01:51:31,620 --> 01:51:34,960
我必须回去
I- have-to-get-back.

1128
01:52:02,150 --> 01:52:03,820
亚努思
Janusz.

1129
01:52:12,290 --> 01:52:14,280
打包你的东西 快
Pack your things, quick.

1130
01:53:48,840 --> 01:53:50,380
亚努思!
Janusz!

01:54:36,640 --> 01:54:38,050
你听到了吗?
Do you hear that?

1132
01:54:39,270 --> 01:54:40,350
那是什么?
What is that?

1133
01:55:22,350 --> 01:55:23,640
西藏
Tibet.

1134
01:56:06,270 --> 01:56:07,600
拉萨
Lhasa.

1135
01:56:13,490 --> 01:56:15,150
印度在哪里?
And where is India?

1136
01:56:15,160 --> 01:56:17,940
嗯

1137

印度 是啊

1139
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:06,530
翻过山有条铁路到锡金
There is the track to Sikkim, over the mountains.

1140
01:57:06,630 --> 01:57:08,710
很多人去那里

1141
01:57:08,790 --> 01:57:10,910
路上有村庄吗?
Are there villages on the way?

1142
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,040
小村庄 有的
Small villages, yes.

1143
01:57:13,050 --> 01:57:14,880
他们会给你食物
They give you food.

1144
01:57:14,970 --> 01:57:17,210
生火用燃料
Fuel for fire.

1145
01:57:17,220 --> 01:57:19,630
但你们现在不能走
But you can't go now.

1146
01:57:19,720 --> 01:57:21,130
为什么?
Why?

1147
01:57:21,220 --> 01:57:25,060
如果大雪来 很困难
If big snow comes, very difficult.

1148
01:57:25,060 --> 01:57:29,100
你们等到春天

1149
01:57:29,190 --> 01:57:31,480
这个家庭收留你们
This family keep you.

1150
01:57:36,610 --> 01:57:39,360
嗯 我们在冬天不能越过山
Well, we can't cross the mountains in winter.

1151
01:57:39,450 --> 01:57:42,410
他说很难 但不是不可能
He said it was difficult but not impossible.

1152
01:57:42,410 --> 01:57:44,120
亚努思 只有3个月

1153
01:57:44,200 --> 01:57:46,570
注意听着 我们不能放松
Look, we can't let go.

1154
01:57:46,580 --> 01:57:48,320
你是什么意思?
What do you mean?

1155
01:57:48,420 --> 01:57:52,040
如果我们现在停止 那么我们就会屈服于疲惫
If we stop now, then we'll give In to exhaustion.

1156
01:57:52,130 --> 01:57:54,250
不 不是屈服
No, it's not giving in.

1157
01:57:54,340 --> 01:57:57,580
我们筋疲力尽了
We are exhausted.

1158
01:57:57,590 --> 01:58:00,430
我会睡到春天 就像熊在洞穴里
I will sleep till spring like a bear in a cave.

1159
01:58:00,430 --> 01:58:03,760
你可以研究佛经并成为和尚

1160
01:58:03,770 --> 01:58:07,800
但首先你必须学习如何喜欢他们的茶

我们的朋友已经联系

他认为他能经由中国把我弄出去

先为自己着想
Looking out for number one.

1170
01:58:35,920 --> 01:58:37,790
那不是你们美国人说的吗?
Isn't that what you Americans say?

1171
01:58:37,800 --> 01:58:39,920
佐仁
Zoran-

1172
01:58:40,010 --> 01:58:41,130

1173
01:58:41,140 --> 01:58:42,130

What?

1174
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:43,300
我们逃脱了
We escaped.

1175

我们做到了
We made it.

01:58:50,190 --> 01:58:51,430
你说的对
You're right.

1177
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:53,390
他说的对
He's right.

1178
01:58:53,480 --> 01:58:57,270
除了几座山外 我们到了
Apart from a few mountains, we are there.

1179
01:58:57,360 --> 01:58:59,270
我们做到了
We made it.

1180
01:58:59,360 --> 01:59:01,150
不是我们全部人
Not all of us.
