1
00:07:28,684 --> 00:07:30,675
Look at those poor men.

2
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:32,259
They've got night blindness.

3
00:07:32,354 --> 00:07:34,345
I saw it in the transit camp.

4
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:37,351
It's vitamin deficiency from starvation.

5
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,381
Here, here.

6
00:08:05,429 --> 00:08:07,841
You planning on surviving on half rations, son?

7
00:08:07,931 --> 00:08:08,966
Look, he's an old man.

8
00:08:09,057 --> 00:08:10,593
I'm an old man.

9
00:08:10,684 --> 00:08:13,141
I'll be alive in the morning. He won't.

10
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:19,227
Kindness.

11
00:08:19,318 --> 00:08:21,104
That can kill you here.

12
00:08:24,906 --> 00:08:26,316
He's American.

13
00:08:26,408 --> 00:08:29,992
In Here? How?

14
00:08:30,078 --> 00:08:32,990
Stalin hates foreigners,

15
00:08:33,081 --> 00:08:35,538
and that includes Poles.

16
00:08:35,542 --> 00:08:37,203
You're Polish, no?

17
00:08:38,378 --> 00:08:40,334
I like you Poles.

18
00:08:40,422 --> 00:08:43,164
Your burning sense of injustice,

19
00:08:43,258 --> 00:08:45,840
the yearning for freedom.

20
00:08:45,927 --> 00:08:49,340
Khabarov- Andrei Timofeyevich.

21
00:08:49,431 --> 00:08:51,547
Weiszczek- Janusz.

22
00:08:51,558 --> 00:08:54,391
Your charge, may I ask, Janusz?

23
00:08:54,478 --> 00:08:58,938
58-10.

24
00:08:59,024 --> 00:09:00,730
A spy.

25
00:09:00,817 --> 00:09:02,728
That's what they told me.

26
00:09:02,819 --> 00:09:04,229
Ten years?

27
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:06,277
No. 20.

28
00:09:06,365 --> 00:09:09,402
58-14. Sabotage. Ten years.

29
00:09:09,493 --> 00:09:11,734
And you were on Soviet side of line,

30
00:09:11,828 --> 00:09:14,410
and they arrest you. They accuse you of spying.

31
00:09:14,414 --> 00:09:16,871
Torture you, huh?

32
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,414
Did you sign confession?

33
00:09:18,418 --> 00:09:19,908
No.

34
00:09:20,003 --> 00:09:22,619
No, I wouldn't sign,

35
00:09:22,714 --> 00:09:25,956
so they-they tortured someone else.

36
00:09:26,051 --> 00:09:29,760
Forgive me.

37
00:09:29,763 --> 00:09:31,924
I was actor.

38
00:09:31,932 --> 00:09:33,468
Moving pictures.

39
00:09:33,558 --> 00:09:38,222
In my last picture, I played aristocrat.

40
00:09:38,313 --> 00:09:40,554
They arrested me when the film was released.

41
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:42,105
Why?

42
00:09:42,192 --> 00:09:43,898
it was claimed

43
00:09:43,985 --> 00:09:49,446
I was elevating the status of the old nobility.

44
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:52,991
So you got ten years for a performance in a film.

45
00:09:53,078 --> 00:09:55,490
I've had better notices.

46
00:10:10,262 --> 00:10:11,627
Nyet.

47
00:10:21,064 --> 00:10:22,304
The Urki.

48
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,141
Do you know who these are?

49
00:10:25,235 --> 00:10:27,817
Professional criminals.

50
00:10:27,904 --> 00:10:30,145
Murderers and thieves.

51
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,151
Don't stare at them.

52
00:10:32,242 --> 00:10:34,654
The guards let them run things in here,

53
00:10:34,744 --> 00:10:36,280
and they are to be feared.

54
00:10:36,371 --> 00:10:38,111
Then why would they let them run things?

55
00:10:38,206 --> 00:10:41,198
Because they are byproduct of bourgeois society

56
00:10:41,293 --> 00:10:43,284
and so friends of people.

57
00:10:43,378 --> 00:10:49,499
We are political prisoners and so enemies of people.

58
00:10:49,593 --> 00:10:53,051
The Soviet Union has become one vast prison.

59
00:10:53,138 --> 00:10:55,129
Slave labor.

60
00:10:55,223 --> 00:10:58,340
They are from far reaches of Soviet Empire,

61
00:10:58,435 --> 00:11:02,724
all caught up in same net.

62
00:11:02,814 --> 00:11:05,977
And, uh, do any of them wriggle out of the net?

63
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:10,106
No, Janusz. You must be more careful.

64
00:11:13,533 --> 00:11:16,400
Stalin has eyes and ears everywhere,

65
00:11:16,495 --> 00:11:17,985
even in here.

66
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,991
If you are not more careful,

67
00:11:21,082 --> 00:11:23,243
you will die after one year.

68
00:11:23,335 --> 00:11:24,916
If not literally,

69
00:11:28,048 --> 00:11:31,006
then spirit.

70
00:11:31,092 --> 00:11:34,755
And how long have you been in here?

71
00:11:34,846 --> 00:11:38,589
Eleven months and 29 days.

72
00:14:13,171 --> 00:14:17,210
You do for me.

73
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,915
You want me to draw you?

74
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:21,092
No. Not me.

75
00:15:37,046 --> 00:15:38,126
Lice?

76
00:15:38,214 --> 00:15:39,954
Eating me alive.

77
00:15:39,966 --> 00:15:42,958
For that I have old folk remedy. Come.

78
00:15:49,225 --> 00:15:50,340
The mine.

79
00:15:50,435 --> 00:15:52,391
They blast at night.

80
00:15:53,813 --> 00:15:55,804
What are you doing?

81
00:15:55,815 --> 00:15:59,148
We must be quick.

82
00:15:59,235 --> 00:16:01,647
Or this will not be here in the morning.

83
00:16:01,738 --> 00:16:04,070
You're going to leave it here overnight? Why?

84
00:16:05,742 --> 00:16:06,731
You'll see.

85
00:16:24,636 --> 00:16:27,673
It can be done.

86
00:16:27,764 --> 00:16:29,379
I know a way through the wire.

87
00:16:29,474 --> 00:16:30,839
How?

88
00:16:30,934 --> 00:16:32,799
Lazar, my associate,

89
00:16:32,894 --> 00:16:34,885
he is overseer of construction.

90
00:16:34,979 --> 00:16:37,186
He showed me.

91
00:16:37,273 --> 00:16:40,015
If you ever escape the camps,

92
00:16:40,026 --> 00:16:43,143
and I've been waiting so long for someone like you,

93
00:16:43,238 --> 00:16:45,320
someone with the strength,

94
00:16:45,406 --> 00:16:47,522
the will to see it through.

95
00:16:47,617 --> 00:16:49,528
But to go where?

96
00:16:49,619 --> 00:16:51,701
I mean, we can't go west.

97
00:16:51,704 --> 00:16:54,491
I mean, apart from the Germans, there's the Soviets.

98
00:16:54,582 --> 00:16:58,074
And east, all Soviet right to the Pacific.

99
00:16:58,169 --> 00:16:59,705
No, no, no, no.

100
00:16:59,712 --> 00:17:01,373
North. Have to be- have to be south.

101
00:17:01,464 --> 00:17:03,170
Correct.

102
00:17:03,258 --> 00:17:05,874
But do you know where we are? I mean, exactly?

103
00:17:05,885 --> 00:17:12,802
I beileve we are about 500 kilometers north of Lake Baikal.

104
00:17:12,892 --> 00:17:15,053
This is the lake.

105
00:17:15,144 --> 00:17:16,554
Camp is here.

106
00:17:16,563 --> 00:17:18,394
And the border is here.

107
00:17:18,398 --> 00:17:20,559
We could follow the edge of the lake here.

108
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,436
That runs due south.

109
00:17:22,527 --> 00:17:24,893
Exactly. Then we cross the Trans-Siberian Railway

110
00:17:24,988 --> 00:17:28,526
to the Mongolian border and freedom.

111
00:17:28,616 --> 00:17:30,277
Spring is already upon us.

112
00:17:30,368 --> 00:17:31,949
We will have to wait till autumn.

113
00:17:32,036 --> 00:17:33,242
No. Why wait?

114
00:17:33,246 --> 00:17:35,282
Why?

115
00:17:35,373 --> 00:17:38,080
Because it is a thousand kilometers to the border, maybe more.

116
00:17:38,084 --> 00:17:41,702
We need careful planning. We need to stockpile food.

117
00:17:41,796 --> 00:17:44,287
I've already begun trading, dealing.

118
00:17:44,382 --> 00:17:46,122
You must do the same.

119
00:17:46,217 --> 00:17:48,924
And in autumn, the weather is more predictable.

120
00:17:52,807 --> 00:17:56,891
We can use the new snow to cover our tracks.

121
00:17:56,978 --> 00:17:59,310
And we bring my friends.

122
00:17:59,397 --> 00:18:01,262
Your friends? You trust them?

123
00:18:01,274 --> 00:18:02,889
Of course.

124
00:18:02,984 --> 00:18:05,771
They won't all survive.

125
00:18:05,862 --> 00:18:07,853
But they will die free men.

126
00:18:11,075 --> 00:18:12,406
Free.

127
00:20:38,556 --> 00:20:41,389
That's a really brave man!

128
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,176
First we need big branches!

129
00:21:19,263 --> 00:21:22,221
One on each side and then one on the back!

130
00:21:27,855 --> 00:21:29,516
Help me, Kazik.

131
00:21:29,607 --> 00:21:32,440
These down there, put it there on the branch.

132
00:21:32,527 --> 00:21:34,017
Yes, yes.

133
00:21:34,112 --> 00:21:35,602
Follow me. We'll both go like this.

134
00:21:35,696 --> 00:21:36,731
What?

135
00:21:36,823 --> 00:21:38,108
Good.

136
00:21:41,035 --> 00:21:43,151
Yes. Put it there.

137
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,871
Zoran! Your blanket!

138
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:50,371
For a wind break.

139
00:21:50,461 --> 00:21:53,168
Get in. Come on.

140
00:21:53,256 --> 00:21:54,746
Come!

141
00:21:54,841 --> 00:21:57,207
Please come with us! We have shelter!

142
00:22:10,481 --> 00:22:15,521
I am Zoran, Yugoslav. That's Janusz.

143
00:22:15,528 --> 00:22:17,234
And he's Kazik.

144
00:22:17,321 --> 00:22:18,310
Horodinsky.

145
00:22:18,406 --> 00:22:19,486
They are Polish.

146
00:22:19,574 --> 00:22:23,658
Voss. I'm Latvian.

147
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:26,736
It's a League of Nations.

148
00:22:26,831 --> 00:22:28,037
And you are?

149
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,247
Smith.

150
00:22:30,334 --> 00:22:31,870
And your first name.

151
00:22:31,961 --> 00:22:34,247
Mister.

152
00:22:34,338 --> 00:22:35,999
Mr. Smith.

153
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,500
That's right.

154
00:23:07,705 --> 00:23:11,289
Might as well have shot us yesterday.

155
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:14,867
We're for the mines.

156
00:23:36,776 --> 00:23:41,145
These collars same as used by ancient Egyptian people.

157
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:44,106
Yes, but on their horses, probably.

158
00:23:44,116 --> 00:23:46,983
No. No, no, no. Same for people.

159
00:23:47,078 --> 00:23:48,409
How do you know?

160
00:23:48,496 --> 00:23:50,782
I was professor of Egyptology,

161
00:23:50,873 --> 00:23:53,489
Leningrad University.

162
00:24:53,936 --> 00:24:56,348
Are you crazy? They'll shoot you.

163
00:24:56,355 --> 00:24:57,970
I've got to get out of here.

164
00:24:58,065 --> 00:25:02,687
I have to get back.

165
00:25:09,535 --> 00:25:10,650
It can be done.

166
00:25:10,745 --> 00:25:12,110
What can be done?

167
00:25:12,204 --> 00:25:13,444
He knows a way through the wire.

168
00:25:16,292 --> 00:25:17,452
He has a plan.

169
00:25:17,543 --> 00:25:19,875
Shh. Who has a plan?

170
00:25:19,879 --> 00:25:22,541
His name is Khabarov.

171
00:25:22,631 --> 00:25:24,087
The actor.

172
00:25:24,175 --> 00:25:25,631
Do you know him?

173
00:25:25,718 --> 00:25:27,674
He has no intention of escaping.

174
00:25:30,765 --> 00:25:31,754
What do you mean?

175
00:25:31,849 --> 00:25:33,555
He's a liar.

176
00:25:33,642 --> 00:25:36,224
He's been here for years.

177
00:25:36,228 --> 00:25:38,560
Seeks out new arrivals.

178
00:25:38,647 --> 00:25:40,683
Me, when I first came here.

179
00:25:40,775 --> 00:25:43,562
He just likes to talk about escape.

180
00:25:43,652 --> 00:25:45,358
I've known others like him.

181
00:25:45,446 --> 00:25:47,562
Why should I believe you?

182
00:25:47,656 --> 00:25:49,942
Nothing is for nothing in the camps.

183
00:25:50,034 --> 00:25:54,118
From you he gets your energy, your spirit.

184
00:25:54,205 --> 00:25:56,366
You feed his dream of escape.

185
00:25:56,457 --> 00:25:58,243
You help keep him alive.

186
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:01,037
He's nothing but a leech.

187
00:26:01,128 --> 00:26:03,414
You are a cold bastard, Mister.

188
00:26:03,506 --> 00:26:07,545
I'm still alive, that's all I know.

189
00:26:07,635 --> 00:26:09,921
But I won't be in another six months,

190
00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:11,590
and neither will you. Not here.

191
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,011
Not in these mines.

192
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:24,315
But if you are serious-

193
00:26:24,402 --> 00:26:29,271
really serious about making a run for it-

194
00:26:29,365 --> 00:26:32,949
I'm with you.

195
00:26:33,035 --> 00:26:35,071
I thought you were a loner.

196
00:26:35,162 --> 00:26:37,244
It can't be done alone.

197
00:26:37,331 --> 00:26:41,449
Besides, you have a-a weakness.

198
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,916
You could be useful to me.

199
00:26:43,003 --> 00:26:44,743
And what is that?

200
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:46,795
Kindness.

201
00:26:46,882 --> 00:26:48,463
If anything happens to me,

202
00:26:48,467 --> 00:26:50,503
I'm counting on you carrying me.

203
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,299
Khabarov.

204
00:26:58,394 --> 00:26:59,429
Khabarov, come.

205
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,555
What?

206
00:27:00,646 --> 00:27:01,806
Come with me. Now.

207
00:27:01,897 --> 00:27:02,932
What is it? What? What?

208
00:27:03,023 --> 00:27:04,012
Come. Look at this.

209
00:27:04,108 --> 00:27:05,439
Look at this.

210
00:27:05,526 --> 00:27:08,313
We can go. We can go tonight.

211
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,356
The storm will cover our tracks.

212
00:27:10,448 --> 00:27:11,984
No, no, no. What are you talking about? It's a passing storm!

213
00:27:11,991 --> 00:27:13,276
No, it's enough.

214
00:27:13,367 --> 00:27:14,857
Janusz, that is impossible.

215
00:27:14,952 --> 00:27:17,193
We need- We need detailed preparation,

216
00:27:17,288 --> 00:27:18,824
we need plans, we need maps.

217
00:27:18,914 --> 00:27:20,996
No, no, the timing will never be perfect.

218
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:22,789
Look, they won't expect it now.

219
00:27:22,877 --> 00:27:24,208
Are you crazy?

220
00:27:24,295 --> 00:27:26,126
What about the distances, huh?

221
00:27:26,213 --> 00:27:28,454
It's, it's a thousand kilometers, and we need food.

222
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:30,039
Plenty of food.

223
00:27:30,134 --> 00:27:31,465
But, but we have food. You have food.

224
00:27:31,552 --> 00:27:33,042
Look, the American is with us.

225
00:27:33,137 --> 00:27:34,843
We've been trading, just like you said.

226
00:27:34,847 --> 00:27:36,178
How long will that last?

227
00:27:36,265 --> 00:27:37,550
Look, I've spent half my life

228
00:27:37,641 --> 00:27:38,847
In the woods and mountains.

229
00:27:38,934 --> 00:27:41,676
We can live off the land.

230
00:27:41,687 --> 00:27:43,848
You don't understand. You are too young.

231
00:27:43,856 --> 00:27:44,891
It cannot be done.

232
00:27:44,982 --> 00:27:46,017
What else is there?

233
00:27:46,025 --> 00:27:47,185
You hear me?

234
00:27:47,276 --> 00:27:48,311
To stay here and die?

235
00:27:48,402 --> 00:27:49,938
It cannot be done.

236
00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:51,860
Andrei! How do we get through that wire?

237
00:27:51,947 --> 00:27:54,029
I don't know what you are talking about.

238
00:27:54,033 --> 00:27:56,069
Your friend Lazar-

239
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,651
I mean, he knows, doesn't he?

240
00:27:58,746 --> 00:28:00,361
You told me that.

241
00:28:18,265 --> 00:28:19,801
Piss off now.

242
00:28:28,192 --> 00:28:29,523
You can't see, can you?

243
00:28:32,488 --> 00:28:34,228
Please don't leave me behind.

244
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,855
Promise me, Andrejs.

245
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:38,111
I can hold onto your shoulder by night.

246
00:28:38,202 --> 00:28:39,612
I can-I can see shapes.

247
00:28:39,703 --> 00:28:42,410
By day I can see just fine.

248
00:28:42,498 --> 00:28:46,082
I won't hold you up.

249
00:28:46,085 --> 00:28:50,249
Please don't tell the others.

250
00:28:50,339 --> 00:28:53,923
In here, I die.

251
00:29:20,327 --> 00:29:21,692
Swiss.

252
00:30:04,538 --> 00:30:06,494
There are no secrets here.

253
00:30:06,582 --> 00:30:08,163
What do you want?

254
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,662
The game goes against me.

255
00:30:10,669 --> 00:30:13,786
Small debt, they take fingers.

256
00:30:13,881 --> 00:30:16,497
Big debt, they take head.

257
00:30:16,508 --> 00:30:18,794
Me, big debt.

258
00:30:18,886 --> 00:30:22,504
But I never gambie my Wolf.

259
00:30:22,514 --> 00:30:24,050
In forest, you need knife,

260
00:30:24,141 --> 00:30:26,678
and I need miracle. Get me out of here.

261
00:31:49,476 --> 00:31:50,966
Come on! Come on!

262
00:31:51,061 --> 00:31:52,801
Look! keep going. Keep going!

263
00:31:52,896 --> 00:31:54,227
We must keep going! Get up!

264
00:31:54,314 --> 00:31:55,770
Get up!

265
00:31:55,858 --> 00:31:57,598
Activity, or we die right now.

266
00:31:57,693 --> 00:31:59,934
You know how fast the dogs are.

267
00:31:59,945 --> 00:32:01,651
Run, damn you!

268
00:32:01,739 --> 00:32:04,105
Mister, come on, look at me.

269
00:32:04,199 --> 00:32:06,440
Is it time for me to carry you?

270
00:32:06,452 --> 00:32:08,738
Come on. Come on.

271
00:32:08,829 --> 00:32:10,194
Come on!

272
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:17,292
Janusz, we can't see anything!

273
00:32:17,379 --> 00:32:20,246
The snow is blinding us!

274
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,001
Janusz!

275
00:32:31,643 --> 00:32:33,053
I need your knife!

276
00:32:36,231 --> 00:32:38,643
Give me the knife!

277
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:40,561
Your knife!

278
00:32:48,076 --> 00:32:50,988
Janusz, we must take shelter!

279
00:32:50,996 --> 00:32:52,361
We can't go on!

280
00:32:52,456 --> 00:32:55,493
Don't you see? This is perfect!

281
00:32:55,584 --> 00:32:57,165
They'll never find us like this.

282
00:32:57,169 --> 00:32:58,409
Never!

283
00:33:29,368 --> 00:33:32,986
You stare at me like snake at rabbit.

284
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,196
He teach me English.

285
00:33:35,207 --> 00:33:37,698
Speak good, huh?

286
00:33:37,793 --> 00:33:43,083
Bread for words, wasn't it, cowboy?

287
00:33:43,173 --> 00:33:45,084
How far have we come?

288
00:33:45,175 --> 00:33:48,713
Maybe 20, 30 kilometers.

289
00:33:48,804 --> 00:33:50,260
That's all?

290
00:33:50,347 --> 00:33:52,338
Less, if we've been going in circles

291
00:33:52,432 --> 00:33:54,263
like chicken without head.

292
00:33:54,351 --> 00:33:58,685
All right, let's see what we have.

293
00:34:00,107 --> 00:34:01,688
Everyone, come on.

294
00:34:01,775 --> 00:34:05,609
We share everything.

295
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:07,232
And you?

296
00:34:07,322 --> 00:34:08,357
What?

297
00:34:08,448 --> 00:34:10,063
Do you have?

298
00:34:17,082 --> 00:34:18,618
And that coat.

299
00:34:18,709 --> 00:34:20,074
It's not your coat.

300
00:34:20,168 --> 00:34:22,204
That is Khabarov's coat.

301
00:34:22,296 --> 00:34:25,538
Yes, he gave me.

302
00:34:25,632 --> 00:34:26,667
And...

303
00:34:35,684 --> 00:34:36,764
See?

304
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,806
He was going to inform.

305
00:34:43,901 --> 00:34:46,768
Don't worry. I talk to him.

306
00:34:46,778 --> 00:34:48,188
Everything okay.

307
00:34:58,081 --> 00:35:00,618
You've made a bargain with the devil.

308
00:35:00,709 --> 00:35:01,949
You realize that?

309
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,450
Do you have a knife?

310
00:35:11,261 --> 00:35:14,128
For direction he uses grass and the mosses. What's that?

311
00:35:14,139 --> 00:35:16,255
I swear to God he better know what he's doing.

312
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:18,511
You should be grateful you're here at all.

313
00:35:18,602 --> 00:35:20,467
Grateful is for dogs.

314
00:35:28,278 --> 00:35:31,315
What- What's that?

315
00:35:31,406 --> 00:35:33,988
Woives. It's only wolves.

316
00:35:33,992 --> 00:35:35,732
Only wolves.

317
00:36:37,681 --> 00:36:41,219
South.

318
00:36:41,309 --> 00:36:43,721
To Lake Baikal.

319
00:36:50,694 --> 00:36:53,060
You are the Pakhan.

320
00:36:53,155 --> 00:36:54,190
Am I?

321
00:36:54,281 --> 00:36:56,397
What is a Pakhan?

322
00:36:56,408 --> 00:36:59,241
Boss of Urki.

323
00:36:59,327 --> 00:37:01,534
We are not criminals.

324
00:37:01,621 --> 00:37:03,907
We are escaping from criminals.

325
00:37:03,915 --> 00:37:05,405
I have been watching you.

326
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,242
And I swear to God you win my respect

327
00:37:08,336 --> 00:37:10,418
with your sticks and pine cones.

328
00:37:10,505 --> 00:37:13,918
I'll come between you and death.

329
00:37:13,925 --> 00:37:16,211
So you want to be my bodyguard?

330
00:37:16,303 --> 00:37:17,793
It's the Urka way.

331
00:37:17,888 --> 00:37:21,801
You have me, and you have the Wolf.

332
00:37:23,852 --> 00:37:26,264
Janusz, how long till we get to the lake?

333
00:37:26,271 --> 00:37:27,431
How long?

334
00:37:27,439 --> 00:37:29,304
Three, four weeks.

335
00:37:29,399 --> 00:37:31,185
Maybe more.

336
00:37:40,869 --> 00:37:43,451
I have us here somewhere.

337
00:37:43,455 --> 00:37:46,447
And down here, the Trans-Siberian Railway,

338
00:37:46,541 --> 00:37:48,782
and the border of Mongolia.

339
00:37:50,337 --> 00:37:51,998
Mongolia seems so far away.

340
00:37:52,089 --> 00:37:54,796
Mongolia? I go more.

341
00:37:54,883 --> 00:37:58,125
To America.

342
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:03,135
It's like this- we have food for another week.

343
00:38:03,225 --> 00:38:04,635
We have no more matches.

344
00:38:04,726 --> 00:38:07,763
But still we have Khabarov's flint.

345
00:38:07,854 --> 00:38:09,310
We need meat.

346
00:38:09,314 --> 00:38:11,475
I can make traps.

347
00:38:11,483 --> 00:38:13,974
We'll be moving too fast to wait for traps.

348
00:38:14,069 --> 00:38:17,527
We find farms, villages, get food there.

349
00:38:17,614 --> 00:38:19,821
Look, there's a bounty on our heads. Remember that.

350
00:38:19,908 --> 00:38:22,615
We steal it. At night. They never know.

351
00:38:22,702 --> 00:38:24,158
We are not thieves.

352
00:38:24,162 --> 00:38:26,995
Then I'll steal it, and I'll eat.

353
00:38:27,082 --> 00:38:28,162
You can watch.

354
00:38:28,166 --> 00:38:29,281
What is that?

355
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,582
Barbed wire.

356
00:38:30,669 --> 00:38:32,500
He's making a fish-hook.

357
00:38:32,504 --> 00:38:33,960
That's how we will survive.

358
00:38:34,047 --> 00:38:34,832
With fish?

359
00:38:36,091 --> 00:38:37,797
But I don't eat fish.

360
00:38:37,884 --> 00:38:38,873
Then you'll die.

361
00:38:41,805 --> 00:38:43,170
Come on,

362
00:38:43,265 --> 00:38:45,677
we need to make a fire.

363
00:38:45,684 --> 00:38:47,174
Come on, lots of wood.

364
00:38:47,185 --> 00:38:50,052
It'll be 40 below tonight.

365
00:38:50,147 --> 00:38:51,102
Tomasz?

366
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:08,362
No, no, not too much, not too much.

367
00:39:21,678 --> 00:39:22,793
Kazik?

368
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:29,095
Kazik?

369
00:39:29,186 --> 00:39:32,599
He's still out, looking for wood.

370
00:39:32,689 --> 00:39:34,930
He has night blindness.

371
00:39:36,693 --> 00:39:37,978
Kazik!

372
00:39:38,069 --> 00:39:38,649
Kazik!

373
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,825
Janusz!

374
00:40:03,511 --> 00:40:05,092
Janusz!

375
00:40:58,483 --> 00:41:00,144
Professor.

376
00:41:00,235 --> 00:41:01,771
I came from the mine to find you.

377
00:41:04,906 --> 00:41:06,862
I thought I was alone.

378
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:10,659
I've been walking with you for some time.

379
00:41:10,745 --> 00:41:13,361
I'll- I'll just sit for a minute.

380
00:41:27,554 --> 00:41:29,795
Not far to go.

381
00:41:37,314 --> 00:41:38,770
We made it.

382
00:41:41,276 --> 00:41:43,892
We really made it.

383
00:41:47,032 --> 00:41:49,364
Isn't that something?

384
00:42:39,417 --> 00:42:43,911
Lord, take this innocent soul into thy keeping.

385
00:42:44,005 --> 00:42:49,466
Amen.

386
00:42:49,552 --> 00:42:51,838
A free man died here today.

387
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,722
Still, one less mouth to feed.

388
00:43:01,523 --> 00:43:03,605
What?

389
00:44:26,816 --> 00:44:29,683
They'll find our bones and your drawings

390
00:44:29,694 --> 00:44:31,810
a hundred years from now

391
00:44:31,905 --> 00:44:36,399
and say "Look, a fine example of Early Gulag Man. "

392
00:44:36,493 --> 00:44:38,859
Shut up with your jokes.

393
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:40,701
Go and find food like the others do.

394
00:44:40,788 --> 00:44:42,653
You do the shutting up!

395
00:44:42,749 --> 00:44:44,364
Drawing all day like you're on holiday.

396
00:44:44,459 --> 00:44:45,665
I'm sick.

397
00:44:45,752 --> 00:44:47,868
I cook. They find food.

398
00:44:47,962 --> 00:44:49,042
What do you ever do?

399
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:52,042
Nothing.

400
00:44:52,133 --> 00:44:54,499
But I make you all laugh.

401
00:44:54,594 --> 00:44:56,801
No, not anymore, you don't.

402
00:45:23,831 --> 00:45:25,696
So...

403
00:45:25,792 --> 00:45:30,286
who will be first?

404
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:31,961
What do you mean, first?

405
00:45:32,048 --> 00:45:33,913
The first to die.

406
00:45:34,008 --> 00:45:36,966
I think the artist.

407
00:45:37,053 --> 00:45:40,261
But better if it was him, the funny man.

408
00:45:40,265 --> 00:45:43,928
Why better if it's Zoran?

409
00:45:43,935 --> 00:45:46,597
More soft.

410
00:45:46,688 --> 00:45:49,771
More-tender.

411
00:45:53,987 --> 00:45:56,729
Mister only catch little fish now.

412
00:45:56,823 --> 00:45:58,734
We must have meat, or we die here.

413
00:45:58,825 --> 00:46:01,066
You're the Pakhan, you've thought of it.

414
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,866
We all have.

415
00:46:02,954 --> 00:46:04,615
That's why you brought extra people, isn't it?

416
00:46:04,706 --> 00:46:05,570
For food?

417
00:46:05,665 --> 00:46:07,451
No, no, no.

418
00:46:07,542 --> 00:46:09,123
We will get more food when we get to Lake Baikal.

419
00:46:09,127 --> 00:46:10,992
There will be plenty of fish there.

420
00:46:11,087 --> 00:46:14,921
You said we would have seen lake a week ago.

421
00:46:17,302 --> 00:46:20,339
We're lost, Pakhan.

422
00:47:51,062 --> 00:47:53,929
Look, if I, uh, if I find the lake,

423
00:47:54,023 --> 00:47:56,890
I will be back in a week.

424
00:47:56,984 --> 00:48:02,945
If I don't, well, you're on your own.

425
00:48:06,828 --> 00:48:08,068
I know.

426
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:10,240
Our friend Valka.

427
00:48:10,248 --> 00:48:12,489
Don't let him out of your sight.

428
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:17,376
Here.

429
00:48:20,675 --> 00:48:22,461
Fresh this morning.

430
00:48:25,388 --> 00:48:26,798
Thank you.

431
00:48:28,474 --> 00:48:29,509
Good luck.

432
00:48:33,062 --> 00:48:35,644
And you.

433
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:27,130
Janusz!

434
00:50:27,218 --> 00:50:29,083
I saw it. I saw it.

435
00:50:29,178 --> 00:50:30,509
I saw the Lake.

436
00:50:30,596 --> 00:50:31,676
Easy, easy.

437
00:50:31,764 --> 00:50:33,174
Three days from here.

438
00:50:33,266 --> 00:50:34,927
Stones! Gather stones!

439
00:50:35,017 --> 00:50:36,473
Heat them in the fire!

440
00:51:24,025 --> 00:51:25,481
What is it?

441
00:51:28,654 --> 00:51:32,021
Hey.

442
00:51:35,494 --> 00:51:38,076
Someone's been following us.

443
00:51:38,164 --> 00:51:41,782
He's behind that dark clump of trees.

444
00:51:41,876 --> 00:51:43,286
If he gives us away,

445
00:51:43,377 --> 00:51:46,244
they'll be all over us in no time.

446
00:51:46,339 --> 00:51:49,172
He's right. We have to do this.

447
00:51:49,258 --> 00:51:50,293
No killing.

448
00:51:50,301 --> 00:51:51,632
No?

449
00:51:51,719 --> 00:51:53,425
I think you've killed before.

450
00:51:53,512 --> 00:51:57,471
You say too many prayers for an innocent man.

451
00:51:57,475 --> 00:51:59,090
Valka, you go behind

452
00:51:59,185 --> 00:52:01,050
in case he makes a run for it. Go.

453
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:06,851
Spread out, spread out.

454
00:52:19,956 --> 00:52:21,787
Valka, no.

455
00:52:21,874 --> 00:52:23,114
No!

456
00:52:34,053 --> 00:52:36,009
We-we won't hurt you.

457
00:52:49,443 --> 00:52:50,649
A Polka.

458
00:52:50,736 --> 00:52:52,351
Polka? What does he want?

459
00:52:52,446 --> 00:52:53,731
I don't know. It's a girl.

460
00:52:53,823 --> 00:52:55,688
And she's Polish.

461
00:52:55,783 --> 00:52:57,444
She's been following us for several days.

462
00:52:57,535 --> 00:52:59,116
And what?

463
00:52:59,203 --> 00:53:00,864
Well, she needs food, you know, protection.

464
00:53:00,955 --> 00:53:02,991
She's been too afraid to approach us

465
00:53:03,082 --> 00:53:05,368
until she was sure we weren't Russian.

466
00:53:05,376 --> 00:53:06,832
She wants to travel with us?

467
00:53:06,919 --> 00:53:09,080
She's on the run, like us.

468
00:53:09,171 --> 00:53:11,378
She'll slow us down.

469
00:53:11,465 --> 00:53:13,751
She said she's escaped

470
00:53:13,843 --> 00:53:15,925
from a Russian collective farm.

471
00:53:16,012 --> 00:53:19,846
I know this type- street gypsies.

472
00:53:19,932 --> 00:53:23,015
There are thousands like that, less use than a dog!

473
00:53:23,102 --> 00:53:27,596
Pakhan, don't do this?

474
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:29,396
Oh, come on. She's starving.

475
00:53:29,483 --> 00:53:31,394
We can barely feed ourselves.

476
00:53:31,402 --> 00:53:33,017
Yeah, maybe it's kinder to leave her.

477
00:53:33,112 --> 00:53:35,194
No, she was sent to us. We can't leave her.

478
00:53:35,281 --> 00:53:38,899
Janusz, we have no choice.

479
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,425
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

480
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,681
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

481
00:54:14,445 --> 00:54:16,106
Stay back.

482
00:54:16,197 --> 00:54:17,733
Stay back. Careful of the mud.

483
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:22,032
Easy. Easy. Easy.

484
00:54:24,663 --> 00:54:26,654
Valka.

485
00:54:26,749 --> 00:54:28,580
Here you are.

486
00:54:52,608 --> 00:54:54,018
Find some wood.

487
00:55:14,088 --> 00:55:15,578
Her name is Irena.

488
00:55:47,329 --> 00:55:48,660
Is the soap ready?

489
00:55:48,747 --> 00:55:49,987
Yes.

490
00:55:50,082 --> 00:55:51,492
Ah, good.

491
00:55:51,584 --> 00:55:53,120
Stir.

492
00:56:05,556 --> 00:56:06,716
Well?

493
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:09,340
What's so funny?

494
00:56:09,435 --> 00:56:11,016
Are you-

495
00:56:11,103 --> 00:56:13,264
you are going to the office this morning?

496
00:56:33,626 --> 00:56:34,741
Valka?

497
00:56:34,835 --> 00:56:35,870
Valka.

498
00:56:35,961 --> 00:56:37,076
Come on.

499
00:56:37,171 --> 00:56:38,502
You're next. Go, go.

500
00:56:38,589 --> 00:56:41,171
Valka, come on!

501
00:56:49,183 --> 00:56:50,764
Now take off your shirt.

502
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:55,136
Why do we do this?

503
00:56:55,231 --> 00:56:59,440
So we don't look like thieves and robbers.

504
00:56:59,443 --> 00:57:02,059
Head up.

505
00:57:06,158 --> 00:57:07,147
Now, still.

506
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:10,947
Very still, please.

507
00:57:11,038 --> 00:57:12,403
Head up.

508
00:57:13,832 --> 00:57:14,992
More.

509
00:57:17,753 --> 00:57:19,368
Nyet.

510
00:58:02,548 --> 00:58:06,837
You know, I, uh, can't beiieve she's Polish.

511
00:58:06,844 --> 00:58:08,880
She's, uh, she's educated.

512
00:58:08,971 --> 00:58:11,007
Speaks good English, French.

513
00:58:11,098 --> 00:58:12,679
Is that right?

514
00:58:12,766 --> 00:58:14,677
You don't like her, do you?

515
00:58:14,768 --> 00:58:16,349
Speak to Valka about her.

516
00:58:16,353 --> 00:58:18,264
He doesn't even think she's Polish.

517
00:58:18,355 --> 00:58:19,561
Well, I did speak to him.

518
00:58:19,648 --> 00:58:21,309
And the others.

519
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,856
They agree she comes with us.

520
00:58:25,446 --> 00:58:27,357
What, you disagree?

521
00:58:27,364 --> 00:58:30,481
There's no room for sentimentality, you know that.

522
00:58:30,576 --> 00:58:33,443
Apart from food, she'll slow us down.

523
00:59:02,149 --> 00:59:04,231
No, it won't take our weight.

524
00:59:04,318 --> 00:59:06,058
We'll have to swim across.

525
00:59:10,741 --> 00:59:12,106
Can you swim?

526
00:59:13,202 --> 00:59:14,612
Yes, Mister.

527
00:59:14,703 --> 00:59:16,193
You wouldn't lie to me.

528
00:59:16,288 --> 00:59:17,528
I'm not lying, Comrade.

529
00:59:17,623 --> 00:59:19,579
And don't call me Comrade.

530
00:59:28,884 --> 00:59:29,919
Irena, no!

531
00:59:55,661 --> 00:59:57,572
Here, come on.

532
01:00:04,503 --> 01:00:06,039
Here, take the food.

533
01:00:16,223 --> 01:00:18,179
Were your parents arrested with you?

534
01:00:18,267 --> 01:00:20,258
They're dead.

535
01:00:20,352 --> 01:00:23,139
We lived on a farm outside Warsaw.

536
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:24,845
When the Russians came,

537
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:26,476
they said we were kulaks

538
01:00:26,567 --> 01:00:28,853
and exploiting the peasants.

539
01:00:28,944 --> 01:00:33,483
My parents were afraid and hid me in the barn.

540
01:00:33,490 --> 01:00:35,822
I found them later.

541
01:00:43,333 --> 01:00:46,825
I-

542
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:53,837
I found them face-down in the mud.

543
01:00:53,927 --> 01:00:58,762
They'd been bashed and strangled with barbed wire.

544
01:01:05,147 --> 01:01:07,513
Later, the Russians caught me

545
01:01:07,608 --> 01:01:11,977
and sent me to a collective farm.

546
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:14,482
They were cruel to me.

547
01:01:14,573 --> 01:01:17,189
I ran away.

548
01:01:17,284 --> 01:01:19,366
I had no food.

549
01:01:19,453 --> 01:01:21,489
And then I saw you.

550
01:01:29,755 --> 01:01:31,586
You can't swim, can you?

551
01:01:34,801 --> 01:01:36,462
What?

552
01:01:36,553 --> 01:01:38,214
You've never been near the water in your life.

553
01:01:38,305 --> 01:01:40,887
But I got across, didn't I? And you followed.

554
01:01:40,891 --> 01:01:44,224
And you said you lived on a farm near Warsaw?

555
01:01:44,228 --> 01:01:45,513
Yes.

556
01:01:45,604 --> 01:01:47,094
Soviets didn't get that far.

557
01:01:47,189 --> 01:01:51,728
That was German territory.

558
01:01:51,818 --> 01:01:55,185
Your parents weren't murdered, were they?

559
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,521
You made all that up.

560
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:04,111
We've all done terrible things to survives.

561
01:02:08,168 --> 01:02:10,329
But don't ever lie to me again.

562
01:02:14,049 --> 01:02:16,290
We've had enough of lies.

563
01:02:27,271 --> 01:02:28,977
We have to go around it.

564
01:02:29,064 --> 01:02:31,305
Quicker through it.

565
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,265
No, they have dogs.

566
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:35,772
If they raise the alarm, then we don't stand a chance.

567
01:02:35,862 --> 01:02:37,648
We need food again, Pakhan.

568
01:02:37,739 --> 01:02:39,479
Look, I know we need food,

569
01:02:39,575 --> 01:02:41,907
but we can't go into that town and risk arrest.

570
01:02:41,994 --> 01:02:43,404
We're wasting time.

571
01:03:00,554 --> 01:03:02,465
What is it? What's wrong?

572
01:03:02,472 --> 01:03:03,962
Where's Valka?

573
01:03:03,974 --> 01:03:05,464
He was behind Zoran.

574
01:03:05,559 --> 01:03:07,675
Zoran, weren't you watching him?

575
01:03:07,769 --> 01:03:11,853
I'm not his keeper.

576
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:13,555
Damn him.

577
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:15,641
He could turn us in for the bounty.

578
01:03:15,736 --> 01:03:16,942
And risk arrest?

579
01:03:17,029 --> 01:03:19,315
He's a gambler.

580
01:03:19,406 --> 01:03:22,614
Irena, do you think he would do that?

581
01:03:22,701 --> 01:03:23,907
He might.

582
01:03:23,994 --> 01:03:25,359
We don't need his knife.

583
01:03:25,454 --> 01:03:27,365
We can make one out of deer bone.

584
01:03:27,456 --> 01:03:29,572
It's an opportunity to get rid of him.

585
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:34,041
All right, all right.

586
01:03:34,129 --> 01:03:35,710
Come on, let's go.

587
01:03:35,797 --> 01:03:38,004
Watch it funny man?

588
01:03:38,008 --> 01:03:39,498
Hey, hey, hey!

589
01:03:39,593 --> 01:03:42,175
You want to get us all killed? Hmm?

590
01:03:44,681 --> 01:03:48,014
Easy, cowboy.

591
01:03:48,101 --> 01:03:50,888
You tear my coat.

592
01:03:50,979 --> 01:03:51,968
Idiot.

593
01:03:52,064 --> 01:03:55,522
Idlot? Ha.

594
01:03:55,609 --> 01:03:56,940
Am I?

595
01:03:57,027 --> 01:03:58,858
Let's see who is idiot.

596
01:04:02,074 --> 01:04:05,066
What?

597
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:06,320
Did I kill?

598
01:04:06,411 --> 01:04:09,699
Yes.

599
01:04:09,706 --> 01:04:11,196
A dog.

600
01:04:11,291 --> 01:04:14,033
Don't believe me, then don't eat.

601
01:04:14,127 --> 01:04:18,917
But you will, won't you, because you want to survive.

602
01:04:19,007 --> 01:04:20,872
I know about survive.

603
01:04:20,884 --> 01:04:24,672
All my life.

604
01:04:24,763 --> 01:04:27,379
And-

605
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:29,222
it's my birthday.

606
01:04:29,309 --> 01:04:32,722
In Russia, that means we drink.

607
01:05:21,570 --> 01:05:26,360
She lived in the streets, like me.

608
01:05:28,618 --> 01:05:30,904
So the story you told us wasn't true.

609
01:05:30,996 --> 01:05:32,952
I thought that story would be more sad

610
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:34,825
and you wouldn't leave me behind.

611
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:45,924
My parents were Polish Communists.

612
01:05:46,011 --> 01:05:50,630
They took us to live in Soviet Union, to Moscow.

613
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:53,256
They want to work for the Revolution.

614
01:05:55,395 --> 01:05:57,636
We lived in the Hotel Lux,

615
01:05:57,731 --> 01:06:00,848
with lots of foreign Communists.

616
01:06:00,942 --> 01:06:07,484
But they arrested them in 1937.

617
01:06:07,574 --> 01:06:09,030
They said they were spies.

618
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:14,827
The people pot me in the orphanage.

619
01:06:14,915 --> 01:06:16,451
And my brother,

620
01:06:16,541 --> 01:06:18,623
he died.

621
01:06:18,710 --> 01:06:20,701
I was ten years old.

622
01:06:25,759 --> 01:06:28,216
They called me Rykov,

623
01:06:28,303 --> 01:06:36,301
but I remembered our Polish name- Zielinska.

624
01:06:36,394 --> 01:06:42,515
I used to say it every night before I went to sleep.

625
01:06:42,609 --> 01:06:43,894
So you ran away.

626
01:07:20,021 --> 01:07:21,602
They have no mosquitoes.

627
01:07:26,236 --> 01:07:27,851
What can we do?

628
01:07:27,946 --> 01:07:29,686
Steal a boat?

629
01:07:29,781 --> 01:07:31,396
No, it's too risky.

630
01:07:31,491 --> 01:07:33,607
People are going to get ill.

631
01:07:33,702 --> 01:07:35,738
I know.

632
01:07:35,829 --> 01:07:37,569
Isn't it strange?

633
01:07:37,664 --> 01:07:39,200
After all we've faced,

634
01:07:39,291 --> 01:07:42,374
these tiny insects might bring us down.

635
01:07:52,679 --> 01:07:54,886
There it is again.

636
01:07:54,973 --> 01:07:56,383
No mosquitoes!

637
01:07:56,474 --> 01:07:57,589
Zoran! Zoran!

638
01:08:02,689 --> 01:08:05,271
What's he doing, for God's sake?

639
01:08:22,125 --> 01:08:23,740
Mosquito repellent.

640
01:08:27,631 --> 01:08:30,168
So what you say to him?

641
01:08:30,258 --> 01:08:31,839
Who?

642
01:08:31,927 --> 01:08:33,463
The mosquito man.

643
01:08:35,305 --> 01:08:36,636
I'm an escaped convict

644
01:08:36,723 --> 01:08:38,008
who is plagued by mosquitoes.

645
01:08:38,099 --> 01:08:39,464
Yeah, very funny.

646
01:08:39,476 --> 01:08:40,932
No, really, what did you say?

647
01:08:41,019 --> 01:08:42,725
Come on, man.

648
01:08:44,731 --> 01:08:45,766
Clown.

649
01:08:51,780 --> 01:08:53,520
Goodbye, Lake Baikal.

650
01:08:53,615 --> 01:08:54,980
Well done.

651
01:09:05,001 --> 01:09:07,162
Mister, did you know Voss is a priest?

652
01:09:07,253 --> 01:09:09,869
No, I didn't know that.

653
01:09:09,965 --> 01:09:12,047
And Tomasz is a pastry chef,

654
01:09:12,133 --> 01:09:13,669
but he wants to be an artist.

655
01:09:13,677 --> 01:09:15,338
You don't say.

656
01:09:15,428 --> 01:09:18,636
And Zoran was on business in Moscow,

657
01:09:18,723 --> 01:09:20,634
arrested in Red Square.

658
01:09:20,725 --> 01:09:23,387
He said he was just taking a photo of the Kremlin.

659
01:09:23,478 --> 01:09:26,015
He's an accountant.

660
01:09:26,106 --> 01:09:28,017
Well, I'll be damned.

661
01:09:28,024 --> 01:09:30,015
I never knew a funny accountant.

662
01:09:32,946 --> 01:09:35,028
Don't you talk to each other?

663
01:09:35,115 --> 01:09:38,903
In the camps you learn to say as little as possible.

664
01:09:38,994 --> 01:09:40,575
Mr. Smith?

665
01:09:40,662 --> 01:09:42,653
Working on the Moscow Metro?

666
01:09:42,747 --> 01:09:44,362
He's an engineer.

667
01:09:44,457 --> 01:09:46,197
His father was Finnish.

668
01:09:46,209 --> 01:09:49,542
Grew up in America, but he could speak Russian.

669
01:09:49,629 --> 01:09:53,042
And why would an American move to Russia, for God's sake?

670
01:09:53,049 --> 01:09:54,710
The Depression.

671
01:09:54,718 --> 01:09:57,050
His son came with him.

672
01:09:57,137 --> 01:10:00,595
What happened to his son?

673
01:10:00,682 --> 01:10:02,673
They shot him.

674
01:10:02,767 --> 01:10:04,177
He was 17.

675
01:11:12,629 --> 01:11:14,119
The Mongolian border

676
01:11:14,214 --> 01:11:15,920
is on the other side of those tracks-

677
01:11:16,007 --> 01:11:17,622
maybe four, five days away.

678
01:11:17,717 --> 01:11:19,628
Can we cross somewhere else?

679
01:11:19,719 --> 01:11:21,209
Here, this is the main line.

680
01:11:21,304 --> 01:11:23,135
It's going to be like this everywhere.

681
01:11:23,139 --> 01:11:25,972
He's right. We wait till tonight.

682
01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:33,305
What?

683
01:11:33,399 --> 01:11:34,855
Nothing. just looking.

684
01:11:34,943 --> 01:11:36,604
Don't look.

685
01:11:44,577 --> 01:11:45,817
Valka?

686
01:11:45,912 --> 01:11:47,903
What?

687
01:11:47,997 --> 01:11:50,283
Why do you have assholes tattooed on your chest?

688
01:11:50,375 --> 01:11:52,331
I mean, they should be on your ass

689
01:11:52,418 --> 01:11:54,830
so you can sit on them every time you take a shit.

690
01:11:54,838 --> 01:11:56,544
You think it's funny?

691
01:11:56,631 --> 01:11:58,371
They are great men.

692
01:12:00,552 --> 01:12:02,383
Whoa, whoa! Valka! Valka!

693
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:05,507
Don't you know what "Stalin" means, funny man?

694
01:12:05,598 --> 01:12:07,384
Means Man-of-Steel.

695
01:12:07,475 --> 01:12:09,511
He takes from rich and gives to poor.

696
01:12:09,602 --> 01:12:11,888
Yes, of course he does.

697
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:14,016
Then he takes both of them

698
01:12:14,023 --> 01:12:15,979
and puts them in a Gulag for 25 years.

699
01:12:16,067 --> 01:12:18,308
Watch your eyes, crow bait.

700
01:12:59,152 --> 01:13:01,894
Thank you, Mother Russia, for your hospitality,

701
01:13:01,905 --> 01:13:04,021
but I will definitely not be coming back.

702
01:13:33,102 --> 01:13:36,265
You know, they'll- they'll catch you.

703
01:13:36,356 --> 01:13:39,268
Yeah. Prison is okay.

704
01:13:39,275 --> 01:13:40,765
Debt is bad.

705
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:42,441
But there are many prisons,

706
01:13:42,445 --> 01:13:43,685
they don't find me.

707
01:13:46,532 --> 01:13:49,399
What about America?

708
01:13:49,494 --> 01:13:53,612
Oh. It's not for me, freedom.

709
01:13:53,706 --> 01:13:56,368
I wouldn't know what to do with it, I swear to God.

710
01:13:59,379 --> 01:14:06,126
So we must say goodbye, my Wolf and me.

711
01:14:06,135 --> 01:14:09,127
You don't need him anymore.

712
01:14:15,061 --> 01:14:18,645
Good luck, Valka.

713
01:14:18,648 --> 01:14:20,639
Goodbye, Janusz.

714
01:15:04,986 --> 01:15:07,693
Look. See?

715
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:10,567
Do you think we'll get there by tonight?

716
01:15:10,658 --> 01:15:12,239
Yes, I think so.

717
01:15:12,327 --> 01:15:14,158
What will we do?

718
01:15:14,245 --> 01:15:16,361
We will eat.

719
01:15:16,372 --> 01:15:17,327
Yes.

720
01:15:17,415 --> 01:15:18,905
We will sleep.

721
01:15:23,546 --> 01:15:24,831
We made it.

722
01:15:50,531 --> 01:15:52,146
Mister!

723
01:15:57,789 --> 01:15:59,529
They're communists.

724
01:16:04,587 --> 01:16:06,452
So it's here too.

725
01:16:15,348 --> 01:16:17,634
This changes everything.

726
01:16:20,019 --> 01:16:21,884
There's nowhere to hide.

727
01:16:38,913 --> 01:16:40,574
It's a Buddhist temple.

728
01:16:40,665 --> 01:16:43,247
They might take us in.

729
01:16:43,334 --> 01:16:45,791
They might also be working with the regime.

730
01:16:45,878 --> 01:16:48,085
It's a risk.

731
01:17:44,312 --> 01:17:46,849
What happened here?

732
01:17:46,856 --> 01:17:49,393
The same as happened in Russia.

733
01:17:54,739 --> 01:17:58,482
Churches closed...

734
01:17:58,576 --> 01:18:03,195
priests shot or taken to camps...

735
01:18:03,206 --> 01:18:04,821
religion banned.

736
01:18:08,586 --> 01:18:12,829
They came to my church, in Latvia.

737
01:18:12,924 --> 01:18:15,131
Destroyed everything, much like this.

738
01:18:20,515 --> 01:18:23,757
I went back later that night,

739
01:18:23,851 --> 01:18:26,513
and there was a lone- lone guard.

740
01:18:26,604 --> 01:18:30,347
Just a boy.

741
01:18:30,441 --> 01:18:32,227
And I strangled him

742
01:18:32,318 --> 01:18:35,276
until his eyes popped right out of his head.

743
01:18:44,997 --> 01:18:48,910
Valka knew somehow.

744
01:18:48,918 --> 01:18:51,455
He knew I'd killed in cold blood.

745
01:19:01,514 --> 01:19:02,879
How far is China?

746
01:19:02,974 --> 01:19:04,589
I don't know.

747
01:19:04,684 --> 01:19:08,927
Maybe five, six hundred kilometers due south.

748
01:19:08,938 --> 01:19:12,055
600 kilometers?

749
01:19:12,149 --> 01:19:13,389
Is Chlna free?

750
01:19:13,484 --> 01:19:14,644
They're fighting the Japs.

751
01:19:14,735 --> 01:19:15,850
I know that much.

752
01:19:15,945 --> 01:19:17,810
After China is Tibet.

753
01:19:17,905 --> 01:19:20,738
We could go to Lhasa, the capital.

754
01:19:35,965 --> 01:19:38,081
What? What are you talking about?

755
01:19:38,175 --> 01:19:39,961
They say we could go beyond Tibet,

756
01:19:40,052 --> 01:19:41,588
over the mountains to India.

757
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:42,634
What mountains?

758
01:19:42,722 --> 01:19:44,132
The Himalayas.

759
01:19:44,223 --> 01:19:45,679
Join the British Army.

760
01:19:45,766 --> 01:19:47,506
Fight Nazls, then fight the Russians.

761
01:19:47,602 --> 01:19:50,469
Go over the Himalayas?

762
01:19:50,563 --> 01:19:54,181
How? On a magic carpet?

763
01:19:54,275 --> 01:19:56,482
How?

764
01:19:56,485 --> 01:19:58,191
We walk.

765
01:20:13,377 --> 01:20:14,366
Careful.

766
01:20:28,267 --> 01:20:30,633
Come on, wake up.

767
01:20:30,728 --> 01:20:33,686
I was in the middle of this beautiful dream.

768
01:20:33,773 --> 01:20:36,185
I was about to eat some salt.

769
01:20:36,275 --> 01:20:38,311
I almost taste it.

770
01:20:38,402 --> 01:20:41,235
I just want to go back to that dream.

771
01:20:41,322 --> 01:20:43,062
It's a very simple recipe.

772
01:20:43,157 --> 01:20:45,990
You just need two sprigs of rosemary

773
01:20:46,077 --> 01:20:47,692
and a pinch of nutmeg.

774
01:20:47,787 --> 01:20:50,199
Nutmeg? What about the salt?

775
01:20:50,206 --> 01:20:52,242
No, we'll-we'll get to that. Now-

776
01:20:52,333 --> 01:20:53,413
add the oil-

777
01:20:54,877 --> 01:20:56,208
and you leave it to marinate

778
01:20:56,295 --> 01:20:57,660
while you prepare the chicken.

779
01:20:57,755 --> 01:20:58,494
This is where the salt comes in.

780
01:20:58,589 --> 01:21:00,125
Good.

781
01:21:00,216 --> 01:21:01,877
You rub it into the skin of the chicken

782
01:21:01,884 --> 01:21:03,420
with a little bit of the paprika.

783
01:21:03,511 --> 01:21:05,047
But double the salt.

784
01:21:05,137 --> 01:21:06,547
Look, you cannot just doubie the sait.

785
01:21:06,639 --> 01:21:08,095
It'll be too salty then.

786
01:21:08,182 --> 01:21:09,888
I don't care, just doubie the sait.

787
01:21:09,892 --> 01:21:11,723
I'm not going to ruin it.

788
01:21:11,811 --> 01:21:13,426
just double the salt, please.

789
01:21:13,521 --> 01:21:14,886
No.

790
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:16,015
Tomasz-

791
01:21:16,107 --> 01:21:17,142
No.

792
01:21:26,992 --> 01:21:28,448
All right, all right. Everybody keep calm.

793
01:21:28,536 --> 01:21:29,992
Oh, my God!

794
01:21:30,079 --> 01:21:33,242
No, no, no! Don't run! Don't run.

795
01:21:33,332 --> 01:21:35,493
Be calm and smile. Be friendly.

796
01:21:38,587 --> 01:21:42,296
Hey, whoa! Whoa!

797
01:21:42,383 --> 01:21:43,714
Everybody smile.

798
01:21:43,801 --> 01:21:47,965
Hello. Hello.

799
01:23:38,749 --> 01:23:40,205
That's south.

800
01:24:15,327 --> 01:24:17,363
Are we going to eat that?

801
01:24:17,454 --> 01:24:20,366
It's either this or fish.

802
01:24:26,297 --> 01:24:28,379
It looks like a bird's nest.

803
01:24:28,465 --> 01:24:30,706
It will protect you from the sun.

804
01:24:35,639 --> 01:24:37,971
Irena, try this for your feet.

805
01:25:24,438 --> 01:25:26,144
South.

806
01:25:26,148 --> 01:25:28,139
Come on, we keep going.

807
01:25:45,292 --> 01:25:47,783
No, it's another mirage.

808
01:25:47,878 --> 01:25:49,084
We have no water.

809
01:25:50,631 --> 01:25:52,121
There's trees there.

810
01:25:52,216 --> 01:25:56,004
If there's trees, there-there's water.

811
01:25:56,011 --> 01:25:57,376
No, I don't care.

812
01:25:57,471 --> 01:25:59,336
It's east. We're going south.

813
01:25:59,431 --> 01:26:01,968
But, Janusz, we've got to give it a try.

814
01:26:02,059 --> 01:26:04,516
No, no, no. We must keep going south,

815
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:05,805
or you'll kill us all.

816
01:26:05,896 --> 01:26:07,352
Damn it!

817
01:26:07,439 --> 01:26:11,227
Janusz, we're dying.

818
01:26:11,318 --> 01:26:12,649
We're already dying.

819
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:14,146
Stop.

820
01:26:37,636 --> 01:26:39,297
It's a mirage!

821
01:26:40,514 --> 01:26:42,675
It's just a mirage.

822
01:27:14,339 --> 01:27:16,876
Mirages don't have birds.

823
01:27:21,597 --> 01:27:23,963
Mirages don't have birds!

824
01:27:34,109 --> 01:27:35,815
It's a well!

825
01:27:52,503 --> 01:27:55,290
Don't fill yourselves. You'll get sick.

826
01:29:28,932 --> 01:29:30,718
At least we have water here.

827
01:29:30,809 --> 01:29:32,595
Shh. Shh. You'll wake her.

828
01:29:32,686 --> 01:29:34,551
Yeah, but no food.

829
01:29:34,646 --> 01:29:36,557
Maybe nomads will come to water their flocks.

830
01:29:36,648 --> 01:29:38,354
When?

831
01:29:38,442 --> 01:29:40,353
Next week, next month?

832
01:29:40,444 --> 01:29:43,186
We should stay here at least a few more days.

833
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:47,114
Look, without food, we'll only get weaker.

834
01:29:47,201 --> 01:29:50,068
And then maybe too weak to travel.

835
01:29:50,078 --> 01:29:56,449
I don't know. After these last days-

836
01:29:56,543 --> 01:29:58,625
I don't know if I can go through that again.

837
01:30:00,964 --> 01:30:02,920
It was a miracle finding this.

838
01:30:03,008 --> 01:30:05,875
Can we count on another?

839
01:30:05,969 --> 01:30:07,084
Janusz?

840
01:30:13,101 --> 01:30:14,966
Okay, give me your best.

841
01:30:24,029 --> 01:30:26,441
Wait, wait, wait!

842
01:30:26,448 --> 01:30:27,733
Go, Tomasz!

843
01:30:30,786 --> 01:30:32,117
Hat, please.

844
01:30:35,749 --> 01:30:37,239
Lower.

845
01:31:46,236 --> 01:31:48,648
Run! Run!

846
01:31:48,739 --> 01:31:51,025
Get back, get back! Take cover!

847
01:31:57,039 --> 01:31:58,324
Behind that dune!

848
01:32:04,963 --> 01:32:07,921
Irena! Get down!

849
01:32:10,177 --> 01:32:11,587
Don't be afraid!

850
01:32:21,980 --> 01:32:29,276
Irena.

851
01:32:29,363 --> 01:32:33,572
Sun-dried fish.

852
01:32:33,658 --> 01:32:34,943
Thank you.

853
01:32:38,205 --> 01:32:39,411
Here.

854
01:32:52,594 --> 01:32:54,550
Can you find our way back to the well?

855
01:32:54,638 --> 01:32:57,471
It was way off course.

856
01:32:57,557 --> 01:33:00,299
Remember? I mean, way east.

857
01:33:00,394 --> 01:33:01,884
There's no-

858
01:33:01,978 --> 01:33:04,219
There's no features in this wasteland.

859
01:33:04,314 --> 01:33:06,600
I could never find it.

860
01:33:37,139 --> 01:33:39,175
When I helped my father in the fields

861
01:33:39,266 --> 01:33:40,927
during the hot summers,

862
01:33:41,017 --> 01:33:43,178
we used to suck on small stones like these.

863
01:33:43,270 --> 01:33:45,477
Made us feel less thirsty.

864
01:33:59,744 --> 01:34:01,029
Janusz!

865
01:34:21,975 --> 01:34:23,431
Sunstroke?

866
01:34:30,859 --> 01:34:32,520
I'm becoming a nuisance.

867
01:34:33,945 --> 01:34:37,688
No, no, no.

868
01:34:37,782 --> 01:34:40,524
Do they hurt you?

869
01:34:40,535 --> 01:34:44,653
No, not at all.

870
01:34:44,748 --> 01:34:48,081
They must be swelling because I've walked so far.

871
01:34:50,337 --> 01:34:53,249
Don't you think, Mister?

872
01:34:53,340 --> 01:34:54,329
Yes.

873
01:34:57,219 --> 01:34:58,755
You lie back down now.

874
01:34:58,845 --> 01:35:00,710
I'm gonna cover your legs up for you.

875
01:35:20,951 --> 01:35:23,112
Irena, we can stop for a while.

876
01:35:23,203 --> 01:35:26,570
No.

877
01:35:26,665 --> 01:35:28,576
just suck on this.

878
01:35:48,144 --> 01:35:50,430
No! Please, no! No!

879
01:36:03,326 --> 01:36:06,363
Come on. We've got to keep going.

880
01:36:14,921 --> 01:36:16,957
My name is Irena Zieilnska.

881
01:36:19,926 --> 01:36:21,837
My name is Irena Zieilnska.

882
01:36:42,115 --> 01:36:44,697
Put me on the ground, Andrejs.

883
01:36:48,163 --> 01:36:50,245
just lay me on the ground.

884
01:37:57,232 --> 01:37:59,143
It's okay.

885
01:38:47,449 --> 01:38:51,317
Command thine angels to receive her

886
01:38:51,411 --> 01:38:53,948
and to take her to heaven-

887
01:38:53,955 --> 01:38:56,822
her country.

888
01:38:56,916 --> 01:39:02,081
Amen.

889
01:41:24,981 --> 01:41:26,972
I really like this one.

890
01:41:27,066 --> 01:41:28,772
When did you do that?

891
01:41:28,860 --> 01:41:31,101
Second night in the Gulag.

892
01:41:31,195 --> 01:41:37,407
Poor Kazik, always in trouble with his feet.

893
01:41:37,493 --> 01:41:40,951
Who is this?

894
01:41:41,039 --> 01:41:42,825
You.

895
01:41:42,916 --> 01:41:45,623
Looks like my father.

896
01:41:45,627 --> 01:41:46,958
Is that how I look now?

897
01:41:47,045 --> 01:41:48,330
No.

898
01:41:48,421 --> 01:41:50,958
Now, you look worse.

899
01:41:56,971 --> 01:41:59,257
You caught her smile.

900
01:42:01,601 --> 01:42:02,932
Look.

901
01:42:03,019 --> 01:42:06,978
This is-just a sketch.

902
01:42:06,981 --> 01:42:09,814
But I'll work on it.

903
01:42:09,901 --> 01:42:11,437
I'll do it.

904
01:42:11,527 --> 01:42:14,519
That's really fine work.

905
01:42:14,614 --> 01:42:20,325
You're a great artist, Tomasz.

906
01:42:20,328 --> 01:42:22,034
It's almost like a photography.

907
01:42:22,121 --> 01:42:25,329
It's the shadow.

908
01:42:25,416 --> 01:42:27,748
It's really nice.

909
01:43:05,790 --> 01:43:08,327
We have to get to those hills.

910
01:43:08,418 --> 01:43:12,536
Water may be trapped there.

911
01:43:12,547 --> 01:43:16,210
Come on. Come on, get up. Get up.

912
01:43:20,972 --> 01:43:22,837
Mister.

913
01:43:22,932 --> 01:43:25,765
Come on.

914
01:43:25,852 --> 01:43:30,391
Go on without me.

915
01:43:30,398 --> 01:43:31,979
I'm done.

916
01:43:35,903 --> 01:43:37,018
Go.

917
01:43:45,079 --> 01:43:48,367
Zoran...

918
01:43:48,458 --> 01:43:52,246
you go to the hills and look for water.

919
01:43:52,253 --> 01:43:53,709
And you wait for us there.

920
01:43:53,796 --> 01:43:54,785
No.

921
01:43:54,881 --> 01:43:55,961
Yes.

922
01:43:56,049 --> 01:43:58,335
We'll catch up.

923
01:44:36,547 --> 01:44:37,832
Did you find water?

924
01:44:37,924 --> 01:44:39,039
No.

925
01:45:17,964 --> 01:45:20,330
Show me.

926
01:45:20,424 --> 01:45:22,631
Please show me.

927
01:45:28,808 --> 01:45:30,264
Where-?

928
01:45:37,191 --> 01:45:38,601
Where are you?

929
01:45:55,585 --> 01:45:56,574
There's-

930
01:45:58,921 --> 01:46:00,036
water!

931
01:46:38,377 --> 01:46:40,868
Zoran.

932
01:46:40,963 --> 01:46:42,373
Around here.

933
01:46:57,230 --> 01:46:59,562
Look at that, uh?

934
01:46:59,649 --> 01:47:01,935
What if-if it's poisonous? How can we eat it?

935
01:47:02,026 --> 01:47:04,062
No, no, no, we cut off its head.

936
01:47:04,153 --> 01:47:06,644
Here. Give me the knife.

937
01:47:06,739 --> 01:47:09,151
Ah, look at that.

938
01:47:31,764 --> 01:47:32,970
Tastes like chicken.

939
01:47:33,057 --> 01:47:34,718
Yeah.

940
01:47:34,809 --> 01:47:37,801
A big, black, poisonous chicken with no legs.

941
01:47:37,812 --> 01:47:39,473
Well, it's not bad.

942
01:47:42,984 --> 01:47:47,353
You know, Valka talked of eating each other

943
01:47:47,446 --> 01:47:48,982
when we were in Siberia.

944
01:47:51,450 --> 01:47:52,189
He did?

945
01:47:52,285 --> 01:47:53,695
Yes.

946
01:47:53,786 --> 01:47:56,573
And? Would you have eaten me?

947
01:47:56,664 --> 01:47:59,326
Yeah.

948
01:47:59,333 --> 01:48:01,824
Yeah, of course.

949
01:48:01,836 --> 01:48:03,997
I would never have eaten you.

950
01:48:04,005 --> 01:48:05,620
Well, why not?

951
01:48:05,715 --> 01:48:07,251
Too stringy and bitter.

952
01:48:07,341 --> 01:48:09,127
I'd rather eat snake.

953
01:48:37,038 --> 01:48:38,824
Here's some water.

954
01:48:47,298 --> 01:48:49,539
It can kill you, remember?

955
01:48:49,550 --> 01:48:50,881
What?

956
01:48:50,885 --> 01:48:53,718
Kindness.

957
01:48:53,804 --> 01:48:56,887
How long can you survive on mud and snakes?

958
01:48:58,184 --> 01:49:00,220
Just leave me here.

959
01:49:04,523 --> 01:49:06,855
You can't, can you?

960
01:49:14,492 --> 01:49:15,902
Look, Mister-

961
01:49:15,993 --> 01:49:18,109
What?

962
01:49:18,204 --> 01:49:23,369
You know, I may not even know your first name,

963
01:49:23,459 --> 01:49:25,450
but I ...

964
01:49:25,544 --> 01:49:28,035
I know your son's name.

965
01:49:28,130 --> 01:49:30,917
Irena told you?

966
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:32,589
Yes.

967
01:49:37,306 --> 01:49:38,716
Can I say his name?

968
01:49:42,019 --> 01:49:43,008
David.

969
01:49:45,231 --> 01:49:50,146
Saying his name won't bring him back.

970
01:49:50,236 --> 01:49:51,601
What are you trying to do,

971
01:49:51,695 --> 01:49:52,775
give me the will to live?

972
01:49:52,863 --> 01:49:54,273
Is that it?

973
01:49:54,281 --> 01:49:55,987
Stop me from giving up?

974
01:49:56,075 --> 01:49:57,815
And are you giving up?

975
01:49:57,910 --> 01:50:00,401
In the camps, some saw death as freedom.

976
01:50:00,496 --> 01:50:03,909
Then why didn't you just kill yourseif?

977
01:50:03,999 --> 01:50:06,411
Survival was a kind of protest.

978
01:50:06,502 --> 01:50:09,585
Being alive was my punishment.

979
01:50:09,672 --> 01:50:12,004
Punishment for what?

980
01:50:12,091 --> 01:50:14,753
I brought David to Russia.

981
01:50:22,268 --> 01:50:25,681
And now no one can forgive you.

982
01:50:25,771 --> 01:50:28,103
And you can't forgive yourself.

983
01:50:30,734 --> 01:50:35,273
Irena told me...

984
01:50:35,364 --> 01:50:37,980
that they tortured your wife...

985
01:50:40,244 --> 01:50:42,735
and she informed on you.

986
01:50:48,461 --> 01:50:49,951
Yes.

987
01:50:50,045 --> 01:50:53,788
They did the same thing to my boy.

988
01:50:53,883 --> 01:50:56,716
Then they shot him in the head.

989
01:51:03,726 --> 01:51:05,557
My wife is alive.

990
01:51:08,272 --> 01:51:09,887
She lived-

991
01:51:09,982 --> 01:51:15,818
and was released. That much I know.

992
01:51:15,905 --> 01:51:18,237
But she'll never be able to forgive herseif

993
01:51:18,324 --> 01:51:21,031
for what she's done.

994
01:51:21,035 --> 01:51:24,323
You see, only I can do that.

995
01:51:24,413 --> 01:51:27,405
She will be torturing herself, just like you.

996
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:31,539
So you see, I have to get back.

997
01:51:31,629 --> 01:51:34,962
I- have-to-get-back.

998
01:52:02,159 --> 01:52:03,820
Janusz.

999
01:52:12,294 --> 01:52:14,285
Pack your things, quick.

1000
01:53:48,849 --> 01:53:50,385
Janusz!

1001
01:54:36,647 --> 01:54:38,057
Do you hear that?

1002
01:54:39,274 --> 01:54:40,354
What is that?

1003
01:55:22,359 --> 01:55:23,644
Tibet.

1004
01:56:06,278 --> 01:56:07,609
Lhasa.

1005
01:56:13,494 --> 01:56:15,155
And where is India?

1006
01:56:21,877 --> 01:56:23,162
India.

1007
01:56:59,581 --> 01:57:01,913
India. Yes.

1008
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:06,539
There is the track to Sikkim, over the mountains.

1009
01:57:06,630 --> 01:57:08,712
Many people go there.

1010
01:57:08,799 --> 01:57:10,915
Are there villages on the way?

1011
01:57:11,009 --> 01:57:13,045
Small villages, yes.

1012
01:57:13,053 --> 01:57:14,884
They give you food.

1013
01:57:14,972 --> 01:57:17,213
Fuel for fire.

1014
01:57:17,224 --> 01:57:19,636
But you can't go now.

1015
01:57:19,726 --> 01:57:21,136
Why?

1016
01:57:21,228 --> 01:57:25,062
If big snow comes, very difficult.

1017
01:57:25,065 --> 01:57:29,104
You wait until spring.

1018
01:57:29,194 --> 01:57:31,480
This family keep you.

1019
01:57:36,618 --> 01:57:39,360
Well, we can't cross the mountains in winter.

1020
01:57:39,454 --> 01:57:42,412
He said it was difficult but not impossible.

1021
01:57:42,416 --> 01:57:44,122
Janusz, it's only three months.

1022
01:57:44,209 --> 01:57:46,575
Look, we can't let go.

1023
01:57:46,587 --> 01:57:48,327
What do you mean?

1024
01:57:48,422 --> 01:57:52,040
If we stop now, then we'll give In to exhaustion.

1025
01:57:52,134 --> 01:57:54,250
No, it's not giving in.

1026
01:57:54,344 --> 01:57:57,586
We are exhausted.

1027
01:57:57,598 --> 01:58:00,431
I will sleep till spring like a bear in a cave.

1028
01:58:00,434 --> 01:58:03,767
You can study Buddhism and become a monk.

1029
01:58:03,770 --> 01:58:07,809
But first you must learn how to like their tea.

1030
01:58:07,900 --> 01:58:10,232
I already like the tea.

1031
01:58:10,319 --> 01:58:11,604
Good night.

1032
01:58:15,699 --> 01:58:17,610
What about you, Mister?

1033
01:58:17,701 --> 01:58:20,488
What are you going to do for three or four months?

1034
01:58:23,206 --> 01:58:25,117
I'm going to Lhasa.

1035
01:58:25,125 --> 01:58:27,081
Our friend has a contact.

1036
01:58:27,169 --> 01:58:29,251
He thinks he can get me out through China.

1037
01:58:29,338 --> 01:58:33,957
There's a U.S. military mission there.

1038
01:58:33,967 --> 01:58:35,832
Looking out for number one.

1039
01:58:35,928 --> 01:58:37,793
Isn't that what you Americans say?

1040
01:58:37,804 --> 01:58:39,920
Zoran-

1041
01:58:40,015 --> 01:58:41,130
Zoran.

1042
01:58:41,141 --> 01:58:42,130
What?

1043
01:58:42,225 --> 01:58:43,305
We escaped.

1044
01:58:46,229 --> 01:58:47,935
We made it.

1045
01:58:50,192 --> 01:58:51,432
You're right.

1046
01:58:51,526 --> 01:58:53,391
He's right.

1047
01:58:53,487 --> 01:58:57,275
Apart from a few mountains, we are there.

1048
01:58:57,366 --> 01:58:59,277
We made it.

1049
01:58:59,368 --> 01:59:01,154
Not all of us.

1050
01:59:01,244 --> 01:59:04,407
No, not all of us.

1051
01:59:09,336 --> 01:59:11,327
What are you going to do, Mister?

1052
01:59:11,421 --> 01:59:13,036
When you go back home.

1053
01:59:13,131 --> 01:59:14,712
Home?

1054
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:16,165
Build Metros?

1055
01:59:16,176 --> 01:59:19,168
Might drift a while.

1056
01:59:19,179 --> 01:59:22,842
I will fight.

1057
01:59:22,933 --> 01:59:27,802
First Germans, then Russians.

1058
01:59:27,896 --> 01:59:29,511
And then?

1059
01:59:29,606 --> 01:59:30,891
Re-build your church?

1060
01:59:30,983 --> 01:59:33,520
No.

1061
01:59:33,610 --> 01:59:35,771
I will die fighting.

1062
01:59:39,116 --> 01:59:42,028
I'm going to get Tomasz' pictures to a newspaper

1063
01:59:42,119 --> 01:59:44,576
or get them published somehow.

1064
01:59:44,663 --> 01:59:49,202
And then I'm going to cook his chicken

1065
01:59:49,209 --> 01:59:53,248
but with extra salt, just-just to annoy him.

1066
01:59:56,008 --> 01:59:58,875
And you, Janusz?

1067
01:59:58,885 --> 02:00:01,046
As long as the communists are in Poland,

1068
02:00:01,054 --> 02:00:02,840
you cannot go back.

1069
02:00:02,931 --> 02:00:06,594
They'll shoot you, Janusz.

1070
02:00:06,685 --> 02:00:11,554
I'll just, uh-keep going, you know, until it's over.

1071
02:00:18,488 --> 02:00:20,570
I'll just keep walking.

1072
02:00:36,757 --> 02:00:38,167
He's gone.

1073
02:00:44,264 --> 02:00:46,596
Janusz!

1074
02:00:46,600 --> 02:00:48,136
Janusz!

1075
02:02:17,023 --> 02:02:19,309
Namaste.

1076
02:02:34,499 --> 02:02:36,831
Namaste.

1077
02:02:36,918 --> 02:02:38,203
Welcome to India.

1078
02:02:38,295 --> 02:02:39,535
Paper passport, please.

1079
02:02:39,629 --> 02:02:41,870
Passport.

1080
02:02:41,882 --> 02:02:43,088
We-we-we don't have.

1081
02:02:43,175 --> 02:02:45,211
Never mind. Come with me.

1082
02:02:49,556 --> 02:02:50,887
Where have you come from?

1083
02:02:50,891 --> 02:02:52,051
Siberia.

1084
02:02:52,058 --> 02:02:53,298
Siberia?

1085
02:02:55,687 --> 02:02:57,348
And how did you come, sir?

1086
02:02:57,439 --> 02:02:58,895
We walked.

1087
02:02:58,982 --> 02:03:00,472
Walked?

1088
02:05:45,673 --> 02:05:53,107
