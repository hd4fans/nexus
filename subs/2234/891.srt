1
00:00:23,763 --> 00:00:26,482
There is no place on earth quite like it...

2
00:00:31,636 --> 00:00:34,799
Here the astonishing is commonplace.

3
00:00:38,045 --> 00:00:41,128
Fish leap from the water
to catch their prey...

4
00:00:41,796 --> 00:00:43,047
and cats swim.

5
00:00:44,561 --> 00:00:47,803
It is a realm both beautiful...and brutal.

6
00:00:49,996 --> 00:00:52,715
Where adaptation is the key to sumival.

7
00:00:56,605 --> 00:00:59,278
This is the Wild Amazon.

8
00:01:15,074 --> 00:01:16,484
The Amazon Basin.

9
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,850
One of the worlds
greatest natural habitats.

10
00:01:23,841 --> 00:01:26,287
Home to one tenth of all the plant

11
00:01:26,325 --> 00:01:28,407
and animal species on earth.

12
00:01:31,075 --> 00:01:32,929
The world's largest rainforest

13
00:01:32,966 --> 00:01:35,685
is watered by the world¡¦s mightiest river.

14
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:37,154
The Amazon,

15
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:40,159
6,000 kilometres long.

16
00:01:43,513 --> 00:01:47,165
This mysterious region
is finally giving up its secrets...

17
00:01:48,638 --> 00:01:50,367
In the past 10 years

18
00:01:50,404 --> 00:01:54,773
a new species has been discovered
on average every three days.

19
00:01:55,795 --> 00:01:58,081
But the Amazon is changing fast...

20
00:01:58,325 --> 00:02:00,202
threatening the animals and plants

21
00:02:00,247 --> 00:02:02,613
that have evolved here
for millions of years.

22
00:02:06,605 --> 00:02:09,927
The race is onto learn more
about this remarkable place

23
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:11,328
before its too late.

24
00:02:21,246 --> 00:02:24,636
One of the Amazons
most elusive and mysterious creatures

25
00:02:24,714 --> 00:02:27,615
is also the biggest cat in the Americas.

26
00:02:29,355 --> 00:02:31,289
A male jaguar like this one

27
00:02:31,356 --> 00:02:35,406
can grow up to 2 metres long
and weigh 160 kilos.

28
00:02:37,482 --> 00:02:39,484
His name, from an Indian word,

29
00:02:39,561 --> 00:02:42,257
means he who kills with one leap

30
00:02:44,153 --> 00:02:45,723
Md he lives up to that name:

31
00:02:46,324 --> 00:02:49,919
A jaguar usually kills with a single bite
to the back of the head.

32
00:02:53,246 --> 00:02:56,773
His powerful jaws
and 3 centimetre long canines

33
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:59,202
can easily pierce the skull 0f his prey.

34
00:03:03,997 --> 00:03:06,602
Unlike many cats, who avoid water,

35
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,274
the jaguar is well sdapted to swimming.

36
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:15,641
He travels along the Amazon¡¦s
intricate maze of waterways

37
00:03:15,712 --> 00:03:17,794
to reach his favourite hunting sites.

38
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:23,996
But even the jaguar has to be cautious
in these muddy waters.

39
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,509
There are giant snakes,
like anacondas, lurking here...

40
00:03:35,037 --> 00:03:37,358
and they¡¦ve been known to kill jaguars.

41
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:55,270
Back on dry land, he shifts instantly
into hunting mode.

42
00:03:58,985 --> 00:04:02,830
He¡¦s equipped with keen eyesight
and an acute sense of hearing,

43
00:04:04,518 --> 00:04:07,487
but stealth is another important weapon.

44
00:04:11,191 --> 00:04:14,911
For the animals sharing his habitat,
he¡¦s a creature to fear.

45
00:04:45,778 --> 00:04:48,906
But even a jaguar doesn¡¦t always get
what he¡¦s after.

46
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,592
He may be a top predator,

47
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:55,671
but that doesnt make his life easy.

48
00:04:59,592 --> 00:05:02,163
Each jaguar¡¦s markings are unique

49
00:05:02,311 --> 00:05:04,905
ideal camouflage in the dense jungle.

50
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:09,592
But theyve made these big cats a target
for the fur trade.

51
00:05:17,232 --> 00:05:20,781
In the 1960s more than 15,111 jaguars

52
00:05:20,826 --> 00:05:23,431
were killed for their pelts every year.

53
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,827
The trade is now banned,

54
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,318
but the jaguar is still threatened.

55
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,116
These forests are a last refuge.

56
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:54,516
The Amazon River basin dominates
the northern half of South America.

57
00:05:57,418 --> 00:06:00,342
mm area over half the size Australia.

58
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:03,421
it¡¦s the green heart of a massive continent.

59
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:08,759
Md its forests are truly the lungs
0f the planet.

60
00:06:10,983 --> 00:06:13,804
But now,
after millions of years of adaptation,

61
00:06:13,904 --> 00:06:15,872
the Amazons wildlife is threatened,

62
00:06:16,184 --> 00:06:18,391
as the forest around them changes.

63
00:06:26,107 --> 00:06:28,393
Ps the biggest lend predator here,

64
00:06:28,428 --> 00:06:33,525
a jaguar needs as much as
300 square kilometres of forest to thrive.

65
00:06:37,154 --> 00:06:40,703
Scientists are eager to get
a better estimate of the jaguar population

66
00:06:40,795 --> 00:06:42,194
to learn how theyre faring.

67
00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:46,153
If they can determine what¡¦s happening
to this top predator,

68
00:06:46,193 --> 00:06:50,118
they¡¦ll have a better understanding
0f the forest¡¦s interdependent web of life.

69
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:55,708
If the jaguars are thriving,
there must be plenty 0f prey,

70
00:06:56,155 --> 00:06:59,352
which would be a sign
that that the habitat is healthy too.

71
00:06:59,826 --> 00:07:02,750
But first the scientists must catch one.

72
00:07:03,747 --> 00:07:06,193
They think there are still some in this part
of the jungle

73
00:07:06,262 --> 00:07:08,674
but in four years have only caught three.

74
00:07:10,262 --> 00:07:13,117
Either the cats are simply too wary
to be caught,

75
00:07:13,185 --> 00:07:15,756
or the population here is dangerously low.

76
00:07:16,952 --> 00:07:21,241
With traps set,
the scientists can only wait and hope.

77
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:30,522
Even ins tropical rainforest
there¡¦s a change of seasons.

78
00:07:31,794 --> 00:07:34,115
In December storm clouds tether,

79
00:07:34,184 --> 00:07:36,596
heralding the start of the hea rains.

80
00:07:40,951 --> 00:07:42,157
For one group of birds

81
00:07:42,194 --> 00:07:44,833
it¡¦s their last chance
to catch a female¡¦s eye

82
00:07:44,952 --> 00:07:46,874
before rain stops play...

83
00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:52,705
The brilliant feathers of male
band¡Xtailed manakin act like a beacon,

84
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:56,626
signalling to any passing female
to stop by and check him out.

85
00:08:05,388 --> 00:08:06,878
Its up to the female to decide

86
00:08:06,951 --> 00:08:10,546
who has the most dazzling feathers
and the smoothest moves.

87
00:08:10,982 --> 00:08:14,395
Only the best and the brightest
will win a chance to breed.

88
00:08:15,903 --> 00:08:18,110
For this young white¡Xthroated manakin,

89
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:20,982
colour is less important than dance.

90
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:25,191
Md hes careful to keep his arena
in perfect order.

91
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:30,313
Even a single stray leaf
can cost him points.

92
00:08:37,872 --> 00:08:41,114
Its quickly disposed of and with style.

93
00:08:51,436 --> 00:08:55,156
But try as he might,
he doesnt manage to impress this female.

94
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,953
Md he may not get another chance
this season

95
00:09:01,387 --> 00:09:02,718
There isnt much time.

96
00:09:09,747 --> 00:09:13,592
By the end 0f December
the rains have arrived with full force.

97
00:09:22,357 --> 00:09:27,158
In some areas an incredible three meters
will fall in just a few months.

98
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:37,031
The creatures that live here
must adapt or drown.

99
00:09:44,106 --> 00:09:47,678
Snowmelt from the Andes
and rain from the cloud forests

100
00:09:47,747 --> 00:09:53,310
send over 2tt billion metric tons of water
thundering down the valleys.

101
00:09:55,873 --> 00:10:00,367
Even the Amazon River, the largest
freshwater reservoir on the planet

102
00:10:00,436 --> 00:10:02,552
cant contain that much water.

103
00:10:05,436 --> 00:10:07,677
Every year it overflows its banks,

104
00:10:07,748 --> 00:10:10,751
growing in width by 5 times or more.

105
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:17,261
Md flooding an area
about the size of the United Kingdom.

106
00:10:25,796 --> 00:10:29,038
Dawn breaks over a world transformed.

107
00:10:52,905 --> 00:10:57,114
Trees here have evolved to deal
with this annual inundation.

108
00:10:58,512 --> 00:11:02,312
They can survive,
even standing in t metres of water.

109
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:07,239
The forest will stay flooded for op
to seven months.

110
00:11:20,786 --> 00:11:24,404
For animals of the forest floor
it can spell disaster,

111
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:25,870
unless they can get away.

112
00:11:32,475 --> 00:11:37,765
The long nosed armadillo lives on dry land
and usually travels only at night.

113
00:11:43,145 --> 00:11:47,684
Forced from her flooded burrow
this female desperately swims for safety.

114
00:11:48,145 --> 00:11:49,635
Shes in trove danger.

115
00:11:50,396 --> 00:11:53,923
Predators like the black caiman cruise
the waterways...

116
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:57,118
and she could sink under the weight
0f her heays shell.

117
00:11:58,678 --> 00:12:00,475
She can hold her breath for a few minutes,

118
00:12:00,515 --> 00:12:02,790
and even walk on the river bottom
if she has to.

119
00:12:05,426 --> 00:12:07,200
To make it across this wide channel,

120
00:12:07,316 --> 00:12:09,716
she swallows air and inflates her stomach

121
00:12:09,786 --> 00:12:11,708
creating a temporary life jacket.

122
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,475
But swimming this far is exhausting.

123
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,720
Md hungry predators are on patrol.

124
00:12:24,396 --> 00:12:27,149
The floods have driven the armadillo out
of her burrow

125
00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:30,117
and into the swollen river
to swim for her life.

126
00:12:36,241 --> 00:12:37,890
This time shes lucky.

127
00:12:53,551 --> 00:12:57,840
Below the surface the flooded forest
is a surreal landscape.

128
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:06,356
A shadow fgure swims among the branches
where birds once few.

129
00:13:07,398 --> 00:13:10,890
Its a manatee, seeking food and shelter.

130
00:13:14,786 --> 00:13:18,244
The Amazonian manatee
is the smallest of its species...

131
00:13:18,911 --> 00:13:23,041
and the only one in the world
that lives exclusively in fresh water.

132
00:13:28,834 --> 00:13:30,961
M incredibly slow metabolic rate

133
00:13:31,038 --> 00:13:33,836
allows it to stay undemwter
for up to 20 minutes

134
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,767
before it has to surtace for air.

135
00:13:43,348 --> 00:13:46,920
This female has migrated
from the river into the flooded forest.

136
00:13:51,882 --> 00:13:55,557
Floating grasses and water hyacinth flourish
at this time...

137
00:13:56,272 --> 00:13:59,241
and she gorges
on the newly available vegetation.

138
00:14:02,349 --> 00:14:05,887
She can eat up to 15 percent
0f her body weight per day.

139
00:14:09,068 --> 00:14:13,198
Plenty 0f plant matter helps her
produce plenty of milk for her baby.

140
00:14:21,835 --> 00:14:25,043
It will take almost a year for the calf
to be fully weaned.

141
00:14:28,473 --> 00:14:32,716
Md the young manatee may stay with its
mother for another year beyond that,

142
00:14:33,474 --> 00:14:37,604
sheltering in her shadow
and learning how to survioe.

143
00:15:07,522 --> 00:15:12,357
Even in this lush environment,
competition for food can be fierce.

144
00:15:17,192 --> 00:15:21,435
Survivors have evolved ways
to find food where their rivals fail.

145
00:15:28,163 --> 00:15:31,075
One fish has come up
with an extraordinary solution.

146
00:15:32,194 --> 00:15:36,710
Its the silver arowana,
local people call it the water monkey.

147
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,242
It hunts out of the water
as well as below it.

148
00:16:01,802 --> 00:16:06,444
Loitering in shallow pools close to trees,
it stays near the surface...

149
00:16:06,552 --> 00:16:09,168
and keeps an eye out for any movement above.

150
00:16:17,835 --> 00:16:19,325
Once it spots a target,

151
00:16:19,358 --> 00:16:22,714
the arowana launches itself out of the water
and into the air.

152
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:33,998
It can leap more than two metres
above the surface.

153
00:16:41,552 --> 00:16:44,999
Gaining a crucial edge in the race for food.

154
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,481
These waters are teeming with fish...

155
00:17:15,193 --> 00:17:17,605
which attract plenty of fish hunters.

156
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:26,195
The Amazon is the last stronghold
for the endangered giant otters

157
00:17:26,272 --> 00:17:28,888
which can grow to almost 2 metres.

158
00:17:30,444 --> 00:17:32,992
They live snd hunt in large social groups.

159
00:17:34,598 --> 00:17:36,998
This group of ten is an extended family,

160
00:17:37,036 --> 00:17:38,640
headed up by mum&dad.

161
00:17:43,084 --> 00:17:44,733
The pack is a welcome sight

162
00:17:44,765 --> 00:17:47,882
to the native Kayapo Indians
who live down river.

163
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:51,444
Like the fish they eat, giant otters

164
00:17:51,522 --> 00:17:54,320
can only thrive in clean and healthy rivers.

165
00:17:55,552 --> 00:17:58,760
As the planet¡¦s greatest waterway
becomes more polluted,

166
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,733
their sumival is threatened.

167
00:18:07,758 --> 00:18:09,999
People and otters
share this stretch of river

168
00:18:10,086 --> 00:18:13,203
with a small fish with a bad reputation...

169
00:18:14,835 --> 00:18:16,245
the red piranha.

170
00:18:18,474 --> 00:18:21,602
Piranha have a mouth
full of razor sharp teeth.

171
00:18:21,676 --> 00:18:23,883
Md when they¡¦re whipped
into a feeding frenzy

172
00:18:24,114 --> 00:18:26,912
they can rip their prey apart in seconds.

173
00:18:32,272 --> 00:18:36,481
M injured fish discarded
by the otters becomes a convenient victim.

174
00:18:48,036 --> 00:18:50,812
Sound and movement
attract their attention...

175
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:52,915
but blood is the reel lure.

176
00:18:56,913 --> 00:18:59,370
The Kayapo know it¡¦s safe
for them to swim here.

177
00:19:00,366 --> 00:19:03,961
Despite the rumors,
pirsnhs have little interest in humans.

178
00:19:18,086 --> 00:19:20,407
Living deep in the heart
of the Amazon jungle

179
00:19:20,476 --> 00:19:23,013
the Kayapo were once a powerful nation.

180
00:19:25,913 --> 00:19:29,724
Today, these villagers
are some of the few thousand that remain,

181
00:19:29,912 --> 00:19:32,608
living in scattered settlements
along the riverbank.

182
00:19:37,913 --> 00:19:40,643
They see themselves as part of the forest,

183
00:19:40,725 --> 00:19:42,636
like the creatures with whom they share it.

184
00:19:44,758 --> 00:19:47,841
They depend on the generosity
0f the river and forest,

185
00:19:47,883 --> 00:19:50,169
but theyre careful to take no more
than they need.

186
00:20:08,883 --> 00:20:13,525
At this season, the flooded rivers
offer the only route into the dense jungle.

187
00:20:16,193 --> 00:20:20,197
Today two village elders
are hunting a creature they prize...

188
00:20:20,473 --> 00:20:21,531
and theyve found it...

189
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,047
the long¡Xnosed armadillo.

190
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:36,562
They believe that the forests plants
and animals share a universal energy,

191
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,443
which must be kept in balance.

192
00:20:44,006 --> 00:20:48,010
They understand that they should respect
all 0f the forests inhabitants...

193
00:20:48,084 --> 00:20:49,836
and be grateful for its gifts.

194
00:20:54,803 --> 00:20:57,476
So, as the elders head home
with their prize,

195
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,125
they sing to the armadillos spirit,

196
00:21:04,287 --> 00:21:08,610
giving thanks for helping the tribe
to survive at least one more day.

197
00:21:15,554 --> 00:21:19,809
The beauty and bounty
0f the Amazon often mask hidden dangers...

198
00:21:21,835 --> 00:21:23,655
Md dark secrets.

199
00:21:24,115 --> 00:21:27,835
Plants are armed with spikes
and laced with poisons...

200
00:21:28,239 --> 00:21:30,116
and snare many animals.

201
00:21:35,475 --> 00:21:37,921
These forests are no garden of Eden,

202
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,916
but a battlefield of survival

203
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:42,806
and the inhabitants
have had to adapt to its dangers.

204
00:21:44,522 --> 00:21:48,913
The bright markings of the Uakari dart frog
mean only one thing...

205
00:21:49,756 --> 00:21:50,609
keep away...

206
00:21:52,756 --> 00:21:56,601
Chemicals in its skin make it bitter
and unpleasant to eat.

207
00:21:58,928 --> 00:22:02,807
That might explain why the female
can risk laying only a few eggs...

208
00:22:02,843 --> 00:22:05,403
and on a very exposed leaf.

209
00:22:09,553 --> 00:22:13,933
Over time the eggs develop
into tadpoles and start to move.

210
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:18,961
Md that makes these young ones
even more vulnerable.

211
00:22:20,397 --> 00:22:22,251
Movement can alert predators.

212
00:22:23,524 --> 00:22:27,608
So their father stands guard
during his offsprings first weeks of life.

213
00:22:30,194 --> 00:22:34,198
Predators have learned that the frogs
markings mean an unpleasant supper.

214
00:22:35,115 --> 00:22:37,527
Its tadpoles may taste bad too...

215
00:22:38,832 --> 00:22:41,289
But they dont...not yet.

216
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:44,756
Their survival now depends
on his protection...

217
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:48,655
and on one last task
that will help secure their future.

218
00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:52,454
Hell take them on a bold
and dangerous journey

219
00:22:52,523 --> 00:22:54,730
to a higher and safer place.

220
00:22:56,397 --> 00:22:59,366
First the babies have to climb
onto his back.

221
00:23:00,394 --> 00:23:03,318
A thin tim of mucus
will hold them in place.

222
00:23:03,722 --> 00:23:06,475
As they take the ride of their lives.

223
00:23:46,429 --> 00:23:49,637
Pools 0f rainwater captured
by bromeliad plants

224
00:23:49,672 --> 00:23:53,233
provide a secure hiding place
for the developing tadpoles.

225
00:23:55,428 --> 00:23:58,306
This will be the father¡¦s last gift
to his young.

226
00:24:04,148 --> 00:24:07,515
It¡¦s only now
that he will finally leave them.

227
00:24:15,068 --> 00:24:18,640
The pools provide a safe haven
and the nutrient rich water

228
00:24:18,671 --> 00:24:22,198
will sustain the young tadpole
for the neut three months.

229
00:24:23,742 --> 00:24:27,826
Then the small frog will acquire
its own personal tooic defence

230
00:24:27,993 --> 00:24:29,915
and the cycle will begin again.

231
00:24:42,867 --> 00:24:47,281
This hothouse of biodiversity
is slowly giving up its secrets.

232
00:24:48,351 --> 00:24:49,636
Scientists have discovered

233
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:54,306
more than 1,200 new animals and plants
over the course of a decade.

234
00:24:55,303 --> 00:24:58,795
Md they¡¦re learning how they depend
on one another to survive.

235
00:25:00,022 --> 00:25:03,230
Its a fragile web
0f interlocking relationships.

236
00:25:15,593 --> 00:25:20,087
During the hea rains
many rainforest trees burst into flower.

237
00:25:21,435 --> 00:25:25,439
Their rich nectar attracts bees
and other insects.

238
00:25:31,749 --> 00:25:36,243
Md it also captures the attention
of an extraordinary group of birds.

239
00:25:38,031 --> 00:25:41,273
Hummingbirds are found only in the Americas.

240
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,955
Their beaks and tongues
are specially adapted

241
00:25:43,991 --> 00:25:47,631
to penetrate flower heads
and extract sugary nectar.

242
00:25:48,826 --> 00:25:52,034
The plants have evolved
flower shapes to match,

243
00:25:52,109 --> 00:25:55,556
allowing the hummingbirds
to pollinate them as well as feed.

244
00:25:57,343 --> 00:26:00,631
These tiny birds
may weigh less than two grams

245
00:26:00,703 --> 00:26:02,671
about as much as a couple 0f paper clips.

246
00:26:02,905 --> 00:26:06,159
But they can flap their wings
up to 80 times per second,

247
00:26:06,311 --> 00:26:08,984
and their ability to hover
while feeding on a blossom

248
00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:12,032
is a skill unmatched by any other birds.

249
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,798
To fuel their high¡Xspeed lifestyle,

250
00:26:21,906 --> 00:26:24,807
some can visit up
to twenty flowers s minute.

251
00:26:27,155 --> 00:26:30,238
They¡¦re drawn to red, orange,
and yellow lowers

252
00:26:30,273 --> 00:26:34,437
because those provide the sweetest nectar,
packed with the most energy.

253
00:26:51,546 --> 00:26:56,188
It is during the rainy season that
many species breed and raise their young.

254
00:26:57,263 --> 00:26:59,914
The female long¡Xtailed hermit hummingbird

255
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:05,525
builds a fragile nest from plant fibres,
spider web and her own saliva.

256
00:27:06,516 --> 00:27:07,995
To keep her hungry chick fed,

257
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:11,321
she must shuttle constantly
between nest and lowers,

258
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:15,952
returning with a life sustaining mixture
of nectar&insects.

259
00:27:17,156 --> 00:27:20,444
Shell do the same for the second chick,
once it hatches.

260
00:27:20,623 --> 00:27:24,161
Her intensive feeding regimen
will take up to 2t days,

261
00:27:24,232 --> 00:27:26,837
until the chicks are strong enough
to leave the nest.

262
00:27:31,438 --> 00:27:35,727
For animals that live so fast,
they dont necessarily die young.

263
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:47,954
This mother may go on producing chicks
for another four years.

264
00:28:01,077 --> 00:28:01,873
It is April.

265
00:28:04,155 --> 00:28:07,545
After nearly five months
the hea rains have subsided.

266
00:28:08,905 --> 00:28:11,521
Md sunny days are more frequent now.

267
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:17,083
The stage is set
for an extraordinary event...

268
00:28:17,235 --> 00:28:20,398
One of the most unusual partnerships
in the Amazon.

269
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:31,185
Flooded lagoons on the fringes
of the rainforest offer an ideal home,

270
00:28:31,232 --> 00:28:33,234
for a floating giant...

271
00:28:37,829 --> 00:28:42,243
The Amazon ian giant water lily
is truly a colossus.

272
00:28:45,312 --> 00:28:49,828
It has the second largest
single leaf of any plant in the world.

273
00:28:51,639 --> 00:28:53,516
It grows amazingly fast

274
00:28:53,591 --> 00:28:56,446
up to 25 centimetres every day...

275
00:28:56,514 --> 00:28:59,756
and its strong enough to support
as much as 60 kilos.

276
00:29:00,468 --> 00:29:04,370
This 2 metre long caiman
uses it to lounge in the sun...

277
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:13,546
and the leaves form a perfect
fshing platform for a green heron.

278
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:23,515
But its not just its size
that makes this plant remarkable...

279
00:29:23,671 --> 00:29:25,548
Its how it reproduces.

280
00:29:28,469 --> 00:29:30,676
The different coloured flowers
are the clue.

281
00:29:35,234 --> 00:29:39,443
Ps night falls the white flowers
internal temperature rises

282
00:29:39,513 --> 00:29:42,516
up to it degrees warmer
than the surrounding air.

283
00:29:43,388 --> 00:29:45,720
That prompts the flower to open.

284
00:29:46,795 --> 00:29:50,037
The white flower is female
and cant produce pollen.

285
00:29:50,672 --> 00:29:54,915
But it does produce a strong
sweet pineapple¡Xlike scent.

286
00:29:56,032 --> 00:30:01,550
That aroma attracts a tiny scarab beetle,
just 2 centimetres long.

287
00:30:04,029 --> 00:30:06,600
Its one of the lilys main pollinators.

288
00:30:07,952 --> 00:30:10,603
It climbs into the heart
0f the female tower...

289
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:15,398
carrying a dusting of pollen
picked up from male lily flowers.

290
00:30:23,109 --> 00:30:26,954
As dawn approaches,
the flower cools and closes.

291
00:30:28,389 --> 00:30:31,369
My beetles still inside are now trapped.

292
00:30:35,282 --> 00:30:39,525
But that¡¦s no problem.
They¡¦re safe from heat and danger.

293
00:30:43,874 --> 00:30:48,925
Md even better: they get to spend
all day feasting on starchy nectar.

294
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:54,750
As the beetle eats,
its load of pollen drops off,

295
00:30:54,827 --> 00:30:57,955
falling onto the flowers
reproductive parts.

296
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:02,833
There it triggers
a magical transformation.

297
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,282
The white flower blushes pink...

298
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:08,165
and turns from female to male...

299
00:31:08,358 --> 00:31:10,724
so that it can now produce its own pollen.

300
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,954
When night falls again, the lower opens,

301
00:31:14,029 --> 00:31:17,829
and the beetle
now carrying the newly male flowers pollen

302
00:31:17,998 --> 00:31:22,651
escapes to search for another
sweetly scented white female lily.

303
00:31:24,157 --> 00:31:28,400
Pollination complete, the pink male flower
will die back to a seed

304
00:31:28,468 --> 00:31:30,163
and sink to the bottom of the pool.

305
00:31:30,921 --> 00:31:33,515
Its fertilized seed
will germinate and mature...

306
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:38,084
to repeat the water lilys
magical transformation next year.

307
00:31:40,029 --> 00:31:43,032
The Amazon is a living laboratory,

308
00:31:43,358 --> 00:31:47,010
where nature has been experimenting
for millions of years.

309
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,750
But habitat destruction
is undoing natures handiwork,

310
00:31:53,563 --> 00:31:55,963
putting many species here at risk.

311
00:31:57,233 --> 00:31:59,030
Knowing the condition of top predators

312
00:31:59,076 --> 00:32:01,749
is a good way to gauge
the health of the forest.

313
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:04,156
That¡¦s why scientists
have been trying to track

314
00:32:04,233 --> 00:32:07,282
and study jaguars here for your years,

315
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:11,003
but so far they have only managed
to catch three.

316
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,210
That is not enough for their research.

317
00:32:15,874 --> 00:32:18,286
So they¡¦ve come up with a creative solution.

318
00:32:21,436 --> 00:32:24,087
They¡¦re using some unlikely technology...

319
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:33,801
M MP3 player and speakers broadcast
a jaguar call into the jungle.

320
00:32:47,561 --> 00:32:50,724
Hopefully an inquisitive cat
will investigate.

321
00:32:51,875 --> 00:32:55,083
Its a long shot but the scientists
are running out of options,

322
00:32:55,158 --> 00:32:57,524
and the jaguars are running out of time.

323
00:33:09,311 --> 00:33:11,211
Many creatures flourish here.

324
00:33:12,998 --> 00:33:16,035
There are over a thousand
species of frogs...

325
00:33:16,719 --> 00:33:20,007
and more than 1500 kinds of birds.

326
00:33:21,236 --> 00:33:24,524
The most successful of all are the insects.

327
00:33:25,874 --> 00:33:30,163
A single square kilometre
may contain 30,000 species.

328
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:37,798
None are more prolific than the ants.

329
00:33:38,953 --> 00:33:42,002
They¡¦ve changed little
since the time 0f the dinosaurs...

330
00:33:42,438 --> 00:33:44,679
and today they make up over 30 percent

331
00:33:44,797 --> 00:33:47,755
0f the total weight of animals
in the Amazon.

332
00:33:49,391 --> 00:33:51,962
They exploit all parts 0f the forest.

333
00:33:53,078 --> 00:33:57,924
Under the forest floor, up in the treetops,
and everhere in between.

334
00:33:59,748 --> 00:34:03,957
Mts consume more vegetation
in the Amazon than any other creature...

335
00:34:06,672 --> 00:34:09,880
and the cecropia tree
is vulnerable to attack...

336
00:34:10,594 --> 00:34:14,439
Unlike many trees in the Amazon
its leaves arent poisonous

337
00:34:14,749 --> 00:34:17,001
but neither is it defenceless.

338
00:34:18,561 --> 00:34:23,203
The cecropia has evolved
a survival strategy that welcomes an ant,

339
00:34:24,031 --> 00:34:27,159
though the relationship
doesnt seem to start well.

340
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:33,116
The queen Azteca ant bores a hole
in a soft area of the tree¡¦s branch.

341
00:34:34,033 --> 00:34:38,879
She quickly gets to work colonising
hollow chambers ioside the stems,

342
00:34:39,718 --> 00:34:42,926
perfect for raising an entire army of ants.

343
00:34:44,358 --> 00:34:48,203
The workers tend to the queen
as she lays her precious eggs.

344
00:34:50,437 --> 00:34:52,314
The eggs are placed together,

345
00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:54,928
where they¡¦ll develop
into the nest generation.

346
00:35:10,717 --> 00:35:13,390
There¡¦s also a third party
in this relationship.

347
00:35:13,718 --> 00:35:16,243
They¡¦re called scale insects.

348
00:35:21,282 --> 00:35:25,321
They feed off sugars found
in the inner part of the tree¡¦s bark.

349
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,393
When the ants manipulate the scale insects,

350
00:35:30,435 --> 00:35:34,599
some of this oozes out through their bodies
and is eaten by the ants.

351
00:35:40,283 --> 00:35:43,855
So why does the tree
tolerate these alien invaders?

352
00:35:52,436 --> 00:35:57,282
That becomes clear when a hungry beetle
makes its way to the trees leaves.

353
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:02,594
Movement on the stems alerts the snts.

354
00:36:07,439 --> 00:36:11,364
The workers mobilize...
and immediately respond...

355
00:36:12,765 --> 00:36:16,485
They track down their target... and attack.

356
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,963
The ants have a ferocious bite
and grab the soft parts of the beetle.

357
00:36:35,641 --> 00:36:38,929
The beetle is soon covered with ants...

358
00:36:42,076 --> 00:36:46,570
fighting for its life...against an army
thats defending its home tort.

359
00:36:50,922 --> 00:36:54,574
For the beetle,
a hasty retreat is the only option.

360
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:58,282
The ants are free
to enjoy the trees hospitality

361
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,362
while taking only what they need...

362
00:37:01,795 --> 00:37:04,923
and the tree has its own defence force.

363
00:37:05,592 --> 00:37:07,765
Its a perfect partnership for survival.

364
00:37:18,957 --> 00:37:24,281
The rain forest¡¦s upper canopy can reach up
to 50 metres above the forest floor.

365
00:37:26,881 --> 00:37:31,170
So inaccessible that many of its creatures
remain a mystery.

366
00:37:32,474 --> 00:37:36,763
When scientists get the chance
to eoplore it they often find something new.

367
00:37:40,832 --> 00:37:42,606
Just in the last decade,

368
00:37:42,724 --> 00:37:45,375
nine new primates have been discovered.

369
00:37:49,647 --> 00:37:51,968
The canopy¡¦s wide range of habitats,

370
00:37:52,038 --> 00:37:55,041
can accommodate a wide variety of primates.

371
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,398
Tiny tamarins, the size of a coconut,

372
00:38:02,473 --> 00:38:05,761
live alongside t kilo howler monkeys.

373
00:38:07,724 --> 00:38:09,601
One of the most bizarre looking...

374
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:15,016
is the Red Uakari that shares
its name with the poison frog.

375
00:38:16,552 --> 00:38:19,043
Local people call it the English monkey

376
00:38:19,115 --> 00:38:22,084
because its red face looks like
a pale skinned foreigner

377
00:38:22,161 --> 00:38:23,833
whos been in the sun for too long.

378
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:29,531
In fact that red face serves
an important purpose.

379
00:38:33,725 --> 00:38:36,319
The brighter the colour,
the healthier the animal.

380
00:38:37,117 --> 00:38:40,041
That¡¦s a vital sign to look
for in selecting a mate.

381
00:38:44,192 --> 00:38:49,289
When trees are in fruit uakaris spend most
0f their time foraging in the upper canopy.

382
00:38:59,553 --> 00:39:02,204
They use their amazingly strong lower jaws

383
00:39:02,288 --> 00:39:05,655
to open the tough skins
of unripe fruits and nuts

384
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,802
which other primates have to abandon.

385
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:14,447
Their small tails are unique
among Amazon monkeys.

386
00:39:16,193 --> 00:39:20,323
But that shortcoming doesn¡¦t stop them
travelling through the trees with ease.

387
00:39:28,521 --> 00:39:30,011
Family members groom each other

388
00:39:30,082 --> 00:39:33,324
to strengthen bonds
and to establish a pecking order.

389
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:44,558
Their social hierarchy is crucial
for keeping the troop together.

390
00:39:56,723 --> 00:40:01,683
Juvenile males forge their own relationships
throogh play and mock ights

391
00:40:06,288 --> 00:40:09,007
Sometimes its hard to tell which is which.

392
00:40:33,288 --> 00:40:35,574
Their antics seme another purpose:

393
00:40:35,609 --> 00:40:39,830
helping young monkeys develop the skills
theyll need to survive in the csnopy.

394
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:50,040
The dry season is approaching

395
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:54,368
and the troop must take advantage
of the last remaining fruits of the flood.

396
00:41:05,638 --> 00:41:07,754
A careless fumble provides a treat

397
00:41:07,826 --> 00:41:11,239
to the tambaqui fish
lurking in the shallows below.

398
00:41:26,354 --> 00:41:30,632
The lush green world of the canopy
is not withoot dangers.

399
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:35,945
A squirrel monkey spots
a harpy eagle and sounds the alarm,

400
00:41:36,458 --> 00:41:38,824
alerting everything in earshot.

401
00:41:51,912 --> 00:41:56,076
The giant Harpy eagle is well¡Xadapted
to life in the thick canopy.

402
00:42:01,193 --> 00:42:05,072
Md it¡¦s fully capable
of plucking a monkey right off a branch.

403
00:42:06,507 --> 00:42:10,637
A determined male with a chick
to feed poses a special threat.

404
00:42:11,351 --> 00:42:14,275
Ranging far and wide to find food,

405
00:42:14,786 --> 00:42:18,870
its nest is over 3 kilometres away
at the top of a giant tree.

406
00:42:21,835 --> 00:42:25,362
The cumaru tree can grow up
to a height of 5t metres.

407
00:42:26,068 --> 00:42:29,310
Local people prize its bsrk
and seeds as medicine,

408
00:42:29,382 --> 00:42:32,715
using it to treat everything
from snake bite to earache.

409
00:42:39,864 --> 00:42:43,994
The female harpy eagle
and her chick nest safely in its crown.

410
00:42:46,068 --> 00:42:48,024
She is truly a giant,

411
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:51,110
the largest raptor in the Americas,

412
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:53,991
with ewing span of up to two meters.

413
00:42:56,069 --> 00:42:59,311
Her talons are as large as a grizzly bears.

414
00:43:00,584 --> 00:43:04,350
capable of grabbing prey
that weighs half as much as she does.

415
00:43:07,708 --> 00:43:09,630
In spite of her size end strength,

416
00:43:09,707 --> 00:43:12,232
her chick is at risk from many enemies,

417
00:43:16,352 --> 00:43:19,389
including disease¡Xcarrying flies.

418
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:31,794
Like the native tribes,

419
00:43:31,866 --> 00:43:36,280
it seems the mother understsnds something
about the health benefits of plants.

420
00:43:41,664 --> 00:43:46,351
She frequently brings fresh green twigs
and branches to freshen the nest.

421
00:43:49,552 --> 00:43:54,114
Her efforts seem to keep parasites
and insects away from her precious chick.

422
00:44:11,631 --> 00:44:15,590
But there are other threats
for which she has no defence.

423
00:44:33,225 --> 00:44:37,912
The valuable hardwood
0f the cumaru tree is sought out by loggers.

424
00:44:51,304 --> 00:44:53,920
Man may not be king of this jungle,

425
00:44:54,428 --> 00:44:58,068
but with a chainsaw in his hand,
he can rule supreme.

426
00:45:36,914 --> 00:45:40,953
Nearly 20 percent 0f the Amazon rainforest
has already been cleared,

427
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:44,631
threatening not only the harpy eagle,
but all life on earth.

428
00:45:53,302 --> 00:45:56,510
The forest is a vast storehouse of carbon.

429
00:45:56,944 --> 00:46:02,667
Md its destruction releases massive amounts
of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

430
00:46:03,834 --> 00:46:06,871
That contributes to global climate change.

431
00:46:08,708 --> 00:46:12,712
As the trees disappear,
the worldwide threat grows...

432
00:46:13,427 --> 00:46:16,282
and wildlife in the Amazon is in peril.

433
00:46:24,149 --> 00:46:28,711
Forest loss presents a special danger
for the threatened harpy eagle,

434
00:46:30,553 --> 00:46:33,226
This is the mothers third attempt
at nest¡Xbuilding.

435
00:46:33,756 --> 00:46:36,350
Md the third tree she has selected.

436
00:46:37,349 --> 00:46:39,670
The previous two have been cut down.

437
00:46:40,755 --> 00:46:44,202
It takes harpy eagles a year
to raise a single chick.

438
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:47,398
Will this one grow to adolthood?

439
00:46:49,116 --> 00:46:52,074
The foresters are only a kilometre away.

440
00:47:00,505 --> 00:47:05,431
Ps the season shifts from wet to dry,
water levels are dropping.

441
00:47:09,194 --> 00:47:14,314
The receding floodwaters will allow jaguars
to expand their hunting grounds.

442
00:47:14,632 --> 00:47:18,147
Md that could give the scientists
a better chance of locating

443
00:47:18,225 --> 00:47:19,840
and capturing their quarry.

444
00:47:23,709 --> 00:47:26,872
They are eater to learn more
about the big cats behaviour...

445
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:30,482
and to assess the overall health
0f this part 0f the Mnazon.

446
00:47:35,149 --> 00:47:38,767
The speakers are already
broadcasting jaguar calls.

447
00:47:40,116 --> 00:47:43,358
Maybe this simple technology
will make the difference.

448
00:47:47,301 --> 00:47:48,916
They dont have long to wait.

449
00:47:52,632 --> 00:47:55,351
They¡¦ve captured
a young female in her prime.

450
00:47:56,991 --> 00:47:59,039
She¡¦ll soon be ready to breed...

451
00:47:59,226 --> 00:48:03,048
and her success will be a real test
0f the health of the environment.

452
00:48:05,709 --> 00:48:08,587
They need to sedate her quickly and safely.

453
00:48:18,194 --> 00:48:20,913
This is the most dangerous part
of the project,

454
00:48:21,711 --> 00:48:25,124
for both the scientists and the animal.

455
00:48:42,117 --> 00:48:43,948
The drugs work fast.

456
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:47,712
Now they can the gather information
they need.

457
00:48:55,677 --> 00:48:58,225
A radio collar and GPS tracking tag

458
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:02,559
will allow the scientists to follow
the jaguars movements through the forest.

459
00:49:06,508 --> 00:49:08,999
This research will provide clues
to her behaviour

460
00:49:09,038 --> 00:49:10,835
during the dry season to come.

461
00:49:11,507 --> 00:49:14,328
Md that will help the scientists
understand more clearly

462
00:49:14,475 --> 00:49:17,069
how she survives in her secret domain.

463
00:49:24,865 --> 00:49:29,689
The insights they gain could help secure
the future 0f the forest itself.

464
00:49:35,834 --> 00:49:39,406
The Amazon is I lied
with questions waiting to be answered...

465
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:42,115
Mysteries to be solved.

466
00:49:43,036 --> 00:49:45,561
Ceaseless change is at its heart.

467
00:49:46,037 --> 00:49:49,484
With the end of the floods,
the forest re¡Xemerges.

468
00:49:50,226 --> 00:49:53,514
Birds return to brsnches
that sheltered fish.

469
00:49:58,398 --> 00:50:00,514

00:50:00,584 --> 00:50:04,042
have been the key to survival here
for millions of years.

00:50:06,428 --> 00:50:08,430
But as the world changes,

472
00:50:08,911 --> 00:50:10,913
can the Amazon endure?
