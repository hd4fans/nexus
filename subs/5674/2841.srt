7
00:02:03,752 --> 00:02:06,274
但事情远非如此
But things are far from what they were.

8
00:02:11,904 --> 00:02:14,380
或许一切都不可避免
Maybe it was all inevitable.

9
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,697
人类与科技之间一次不可规避的碰撞

10
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:31,964
互联网本应让世界变小
The Internet was meant to make the world a smaller place.

11
00:02:35,082 --> 00:02:38,127
但事实上 没了它 反而觉得世界变小了
But it actually feels smaller without it.

12
00:02:48,109 --> 00:02:51,586
我比任何人都了解威尔和依芙琳·卡斯特
I knew Will and Evelyn Caster better than anyone.

13
00:02:53,863 --> 00:02:55,988
我深知他们的天赋
I knew their brilliance.

14
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,939
他们对信仰
Their dedication to what they believed in.

15
00:03:03,334 --> 00:03:05,493

五年前

18
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:27,275
# 体会生命的本真 #

19
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:35,503
# 抵达必将到来的未来 #
# Into the future we must cross Must cross #

20
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,988
我不确定这么做有什么意义
I'm not sure what the point is.

21
00:03:41,336 --> 00:03:44,063
铜可以屏蔽电磁辐射

22
00:03:44,294 --> 00:03:49,089
我知道原理啊 我是想问"为什么?"

- You see? Dead zone. Nothing.  - Uh-huh.

26
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,404
当然 但你也可以把它关掉嘛
Sure, but you could just turn it off.

27
00:04:02,196 --> 00:04:05,673
嗯 但你想要尽可能少的干扰 不是吗?
Yeah, but fewer distractions is what you wanted, right? Isn't it?

28
00:04:07,111 --> 00:04:09,792
是啊 的确
Yeah. That's what I wanted.

29
00:04:10,827 --> 00:04:12,474
- 快点 要迟到了  - 什么迟到了?
- Come on. We'll be late.  - For what?

30
00:04:25,892 --> 00:04:28,698
- 嘿 你知道吗?  - 怎么了?

33
00:04:41,317 --> 00:04:44,044
我不懂你为什么要纠结于这些证明
I don't know why you bother with these proofs.

34
00:04:44,194 --> 00:04:46,319
这世上只有三个人会在乎

我知道 但你的投资人一个比一个蠢
I know, but your donors are fools.

39
00:04:57,381 --> 00:05:01,097
他们就一脸痴呆地坐在那儿 等着我说"商用"
They sit there in a daze, waiting for me to say "commercial application."

40
00:05:01,298 --> 00:05:02,581
简直要我的命
It kills me.

41
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:07,770
这个嘛 那些"蠢人"能投资我们未来五年的经费
Well, the "fools" there today could fund us for the next five years.

42
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:11,329
- 这么说来 我必须得好好表现了  - 没错
- In that case I have every reason to behave.  - Yes.

43
00:05:11,487 --> 00:05:15,884
但如果这次搞定的话 向我保证 以后别再让我干这种事了
But if this goes well, promise me that I'll never have to do this ever again.

44
00:05:16,043 --> 00:05:18,088

46
00:05:21,718 --> 00:05:24,194
哈哈 你撒谎呢
Ha, ha. You're lying.

47
00:05:58,682 --> 00:06:02,238

58
00:06:46,634 --> 00:06:48,633

You have groupies? Why don't I get groupies?

59
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,756
沃特斯博士 要过一遍吗?
Dr. Waters, would you like a run-through?

60
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,909
- 好的 后台见  - 好
- Yes. I'll see you backstage.  - All right.

61
00:07:03,178 --> 00:07:05,337
显著差异
Important distinction.

62
00:07:05,495 --> 00:07:09,461
这个人造的大脑能独立发展
This created brain is self-sustaining.

63
00:07:10,211 --> 00:07:14,052
并有能力表达情感...
And it's capable of emotional expressivity...

64
00:07:14,207 --> 00:07:17,093
有自我意识

65
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,006
研发出强大人工智能的努力...
The effort to develop a strong artificial intelligence...

66
00:07:23,158 --> 00:07:26,953
为神经工程学领域 以及对人脑的理解
has led to significant advancements in the field of neural engineering...

67
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,920
带来了显著的进步
as well as our understanding of the human brain.

68
00:07:30,071 --> 00:07:34,946
但有些人只着眼于一个尚且遥远的梦想 会思考的计算机...
But while some focus on the still-distant dream of a thinking computer...

69
00:07:35,107 --> 00:07:38,073
我却相信 旅途的过程...
I believe the journey...

70
00:07:38,223 --> 00:07:40,825
比目的地重要得多
to be more important than the destination.

71
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:45,060
我所看重的 便是利用我同事不可多得的洞察力...
My priority is to use my colleagues' accidental insights...

72
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,096
来研发查出早期癌症的新方法...

73
00:07:48,254 --> 00:07:51,299
并有望攻克阿尔茨海默氏病
and in the hopes of finding a cure for Alzheimer's.

74
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,576
长话短说 就是救命
Simply put, to save lives.

75
00:08:13,828 --> 00:08:16,475
"如果人类想生存 并走得更远...
"A new type of thinking is essential...

76
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:20,067
必须换一个方式想问题"
if mankind is to survive and move toward higher levels."

77
00:08:20,862 --> 00:08:24,179
阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦五十多年前就这么说过
Albert Einstein said that more than 50 years ago.

78
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:27,497
时至今日 仍然受用
And it couldn't be more relevant than it is today.

79
00:08:28,054 --> 00:08:30,213
智能机器很快便能让我们...
Intelligent machines will soon allow us...

80
00:08:30,372 --> 00:08:33,611
攻克最棘手的难关
to conquer our most intractable challenges.

81
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:38,132
不只是治病救人 还能摆脱贫困与饥饿
Not merely to cure disease, but to end poverty and hunger.

82
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,931
治愈这颗星球
To heal the planet.

83
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:43,003
为我们大家营造一个更美好的未来
And build a better future for all of us.

84
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:46,681
我不知道 还有谁比我们的下一位演讲者为那样未来的实现...
I don't know anybody who is doing more to make that future a reality...

85
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:50,034
做出了更大的贡献 但话又说回来 我可能先入为主了
than our next speaker. But then again, I'm probably biased.

86
00:08:51,911 --> 00:08:55,956
请热烈欢迎我科学和人生的伴侣...
Please welcome my partner in science and in life...

87
00:08:56,107 --> 00:08:58,106
威尔·卡斯特博士

89
00:09:07,096 --> 00:09:10,459
我的妻子一直乐于改变世界
My wife has always been eager to change the world.

90
00:09:10,613 --> 00:09:13,340
但之于我 先理解它就知足了
But I'll just settle for understanding it first.

91
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:18,604
在长达十三万年里...
For 130,000 years...

92
00:09:18,804 --> 00:09:23,009
我们的思维能力一成未变
our capacity for reason has remained unchanged.

93
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:29,600
在观众席中 神经科学家 工程师...
The combined intellect of the neuroscientists, engineers, mathematicians and...

94
00:09:29,754 --> 00:09:31,640
数学家和黑客...
hackers...

95
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,188
智慧的总和...
in this auditorium...

96
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:39,150
与最基础的人工智能相比都黯然失色
pales in comparison to even the most basic Al.

97
00:09:39,344 --> 00:09:44,708
一旦接入互联网 一架有知觉的机器便能迅速突破生物的极限
Once online, a sentient machine will quickly overcome the limits of biology.

98
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:48,461
在很短的时间里 它的解析能力...
And in a short time, its analytical power will be greater...

99
00:09:48,615 --> 00:09:51,217
会比这世上所有存在过的人...
than the collective intelligence...

100
00:09:51,572 --> 00:09:56,208
加起来的智慧都多
of every person born in the history of the world.

101
00:10:08,715 --> 00:10:11,476
想象一下这样一个实体...
So now imagine such an entity...

102
00:10:11,632 --> 00:10:15,234
拥有所有人类的情感 甚至有自我意识
with a full range of human emotion. Even self-awareness.

103
00:10:16,668 --> 00:10:20,987
有些科学家称之为"奇点"
Some scientists refer to this as "the Singularity."

104
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,979
我把它叫做"超验骇客"
I call it "Transcendence."

105
00:10:26,298 --> 00:10:29,264
要造出这样一种超级智能...
The path to building such a super-intelligence...

106
00:10:29,415 --> 00:10:34,813
我们必须解开宇宙最深层的秘密
requires us to unlock the most fundamental secrets of the universe.

107
00:10:35,328 --> 00:10:37,691
意识的本质是什么?
What is the nature of consciousness?

108
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:44,284
灵魂真的存在吗?
Is there a soul?

109
00:10:47,477 --> 00:10:50,840
如果存在 它居于何处呢?
And if so, where does it reside?

110
00:10:58,066 --> 00:10:59,111
卡斯特博士?
Dr. Caster?

111
00:11:00,065 --> 00:11:03,507
您有问题吗?
Yes, sir? You have a question?

112
00:11:06,858 --> 00:11:10,778
你是想造神吗?
So you want to create a god?

113
00:11:11,973 --> 00:11:13,460
你自己的神?
Your own god?

114
00:11:13,611 --> 00:11:15,736
这是个很好的问题
That's a very good question.

115
00:11:15,929 --> 00:11:17,496
呃...
Um...

116
00:11:17,647 --> 00:11:20,930
人们不是一直这么做的吗?
Isn't that what man has always done?

117
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:27,800
太无情了
Oh, it's relentless.

118
00:11:27,957 --> 00:11:30,274
瞧 他现在还装着一幅不情愿的样子
Look, and now he's pretending he's not enjoying it.

119
00:11:30,475 --> 00:11:32,042
是 是 是...
Yap, yap, yap...

120
00:11:32,553 --> 00:11:33,961
不客气
Pleasure.

121
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,991
谢谢
Thank you.

122
00:11:36,189 --> 00:11:37,426
教授?
Professor?

123
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,025
你们都是奴隶!
You're all slaves!

124
00:11:47,818 --> 00:11:51,023
几小时前 这座设施遭到袭击
Hours ago, this facility was attacked.

125
00:11:51,174 --> 00:11:55,730
现在可以确认至少五人死亡 十二人受伤
We can now confirm at least five people are dead, 12 people have been injured.

126
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,407
该事件属于一系列同步发生的袭击...
This incident is related to a series of simultaneous attacks...

127
00:11:59,566 --> 00:12:04,771
今天在纽约 洛杉矶 芝加哥和华盛顿特区同时进行
that took place today in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington, D.C...

128
00:12:04,921 --> 00:12:08,160
都将矛头指向了高级人工智能领域的...
all of them targeting major computer and research labs...

129
00:12:08,318 --> 00:12:10,840
主要电脑和研究实验室
in the field of advanced artificial intelligence.

130
00:12:10,995 --> 00:12:12,801
无人声称为此事负责...
No one has claimed responsibility...

131
00:12:12,952 --> 00:12:16,235
他还好 他很幸运 子弹只是擦着他过去了
No, he's all right. He was very lucky. The bullet only grazed him.

132
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:18,871
嗯 好 保重
Yup. Okay. Take care.

133
00:12:19,466 --> 00:12:22,113
他们袭击了全国上下的人工智能实验室
They hit Al labs all over the country.

134
00:12:22,304 --> 00:12:23,666
汤姆·凯西死了
Tom Casey's dead.

135
00:12:24,182 --> 00:12:27,341
他们还除掉了约瑟夫在利弗莫尔的整个团队
And they took out Joseph's entire team at Livermore.

136
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,266
约瑟夫呢?
What about Joseph?

137
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,699
他没事
He's all right.

138
00:12:30,855 --> 00:12:34,060
其实 他跟联邦调查局一起在你的办公室
Actually, he's at your office with the FBI.

139
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,926
约瑟夫
Joseph.

140
00:12:54,512 --> 00:12:56,113
马克斯
Max.

141
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,716
天啊 威尔
My God, Will.

142
00:12:58,868 --> 00:13:01,549
您忘了教我们躲子弹了 是不是?
You forgot to teach us how to dodge a bullet, didn't you?

143
00:13:01,704 --> 00:13:03,544
他们怎么混进实验室的?
How did they even get inside your lab?

144
00:13:03,702 --> 00:13:05,189
程序员之一
One of my programmers.

145
00:13:05,341 --> 00:13:08,897
重重安保 他就这么举着一块下了毒的蛋糕大摇大摆进来了
All that security, and he Waltzes in with a poisoned cake.

146
00:13:09,098 --> 00:13:10,585
我们觉得是二恶英
Dioxin, we think.

147
00:13:10,736 --> 00:13:13,417
这是联邦调查局的布坎南探员
Oh. This is Agent Buchanan with the FBI.

148
00:13:13,573 --> 00:13:14,776
嗨
Hey.

149
00:13:14,972 --> 00:13:16,539
还好吗?
How do you do?

150
00:13:16,691 --> 00:13:18,974
我一直很关注您的研究 卡斯特博士
I've been following your research, Dr. Caster.

151
00:13:19,127 --> 00:13:23,809
布坎南探员是我在利弗莫尔网络防御工事的重要搭档
Agent Buchanan is a close partner in my cyber-defense work at Livermore.

152
00:13:23,963 --> 00:13:27,088
能不能借个地方说话?
Um, is there somewhere we can all talk?

153
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,240
- 去我的办公室吧 就在那儿  - 好的
- Could go to my office. Just down here.  - Great.

154
00:13:30,397 --> 00:13:33,680
摆脱科技之革命 简称"RIFT"
Revolutionary Independence From Technology. RIFT.

155
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:36,356
起源于两年前 出于人际关系日渐疏远
Till 2 years ago, it was all about the disconnect.

156
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,873
人们都短信联系 而非面对面聊天
People texting instead of talking to each other.

157
00:13:39,028 --> 00:13:41,345
社交媒体侵犯个人隐私
Social media as an invasion of privacy.

158
00:13:41,506 --> 00:13:44,823
他们把智能手机放进搅拌机里搅个粉碎 很有噱头
They made a big deal of putting smart-phones in blenders.

159
00:13:44,982 --> 00:13:47,788
- 但恐怕我们都忽视了真正的危险  - 是的
- But I'm afraid we all missed the real threat.  - Yeah.

160
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:52,781
这个人 乔尔·埃德蒙 跟了我一年
This guy, Joel Edmund, was with me for a year.

161
00:13:52,974 --> 00:13:56,496
枪击威尔的那个人从八月就在校园工作了
The guy who shot Will was working on campus since August.

162
00:13:56,651 --> 00:14:00,651
他们渗透到目标内部 协同发起袭击
They infiltrated their targets and then coordinated their attacks.

163
00:14:00,847 --> 00:14:02,175
简直疯了
That's insane.

164
00:14:02,325 --> 00:14:05,530
一小时前 他们承认对杀人负责 并放出宣言
An hour ago they claimed the murders and released their manifesto.

165
00:14:05,722 --> 00:14:11,086
"人工智能是非自然的可憎产物 对人性构成威胁"
"Artificial intelligence is an unnatural abomination and a threat to humanity."

166
00:14:11,636 --> 00:14:16,841
他们下决心要阻止你任何的"超验骇客"企图
They're determined to stop any attempt at what you call "Transcendence."

167
00:14:16,991 --> 00:14:18,592
所以说这还不算完?
So this isn't over?

168
00:14:18,749 --> 00:14:21,476
其实 这就是我来这儿的原因
Actually, that's why I'm here.

169
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:25,149
我们今天一天就失去了数十年的研发成果
We lost decades of research and development today.

170
00:14:25,302 --> 00:14:30,177
此时此刻 威尔 你的实验室是唯一可以唤醒一个强大人工智能的地方
For right now, Will, your lab is the only one that can wake up a strong Al.

171
00:14:30,338 --> 00:14:34,224
- 所以国防部门请求...  - 不 不 不
- So the Defense Department is asking...  - No, no, no.

172
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,896
我不想让政府掺和进来
I'm not letting the government in.

173
00:14:37,091 --> 00:14:38,817
我们从不拿政府的钱 不
We've never taken their money. No.

174
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:42,412
威尔 他们只需要了解一下一切是否正常
Will, they just want to know if the work is on track.

175
00:14:43,005 --> 00:14:45,164
对我们大家都很重要
It's important to all of us.

176
00:14:46,402 --> 00:14:49,527
卡斯特博士 我们对PINN项目可是久仰大名
We've heard a lot about the PINN Project, Dr. Caster.

177
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:51,804
能赏脸让我们看一下吗?
Is there any way we could have a look?

178
00:14:53,635 --> 00:14:54,680
我有别的选择吗?
Do I have a choice?

179
00:14:55,952 --> 00:14:58,031
当然有
Yes, of course you do.

180
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:01,751
这些是最先进的量子处理器
So these are state-of-the-art quantum processors.

181
00:15:01,946 --> 00:15:05,662
在世界上任何地方都找不到更快的计算能力了
You won't find faster computational power anywhere else in the world.

182
00:15:07,421 --> 00:15:09,738
晚上好 坦格博士
Good evening, Dr. Tagger.

183
00:15:12,016 --> 00:15:14,583
它看过你以前的照片
It's seen old faculty pictures of you.

184
00:15:14,734 --> 00:15:18,256
晚上好 唐纳德·布坎南
Good evening, Donald Buchanan.

185
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:20,932
- 它认识我?  - 当然
- It knows me?  - Of course it does.

186
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:23,690
通过车辆管理局记录和社交媒体
DMV records, social media.

187
00:15:23,845 --> 00:15:27,731
PINN 跟布坎南探员介绍一下你自己
PINN, tell Agent Buchanan about yourself.

188
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,288
我叫PINN...
l am PINN...

189
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,200
一个生理上独立的神经网络...
a Physically independent Neural Network...

190
00:15:32,436 --> 00:15:35,242
由威尔·卡斯特博士建造
invented by Dr. Will Caster.

191
00:15:36,193 --> 00:15:39,476
你能证明自己有自我意识吗?
Can you prove that you are self-aware?

192
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,867
这问题不简单 坦格博士
That's a difficult question, Dr. Tagger.

193
00:15:42,507 --> 00:15:45,188
你能证明你有吗?
Can you prove that you are?

194
00:15:45,343 --> 00:15:47,740
不可能编程让机器具有自我意识的
You can't program a machine to be self-aware.

195
00:15:47,901 --> 00:15:50,468
我们自己都不知道自己意识的工作机理
We have no idea how our own consciousness works.

196
00:15:50,618 --> 00:15:53,458
那是你的想法 而很不巧你是错的
That is your opinion. You just happen to be wrong.

197
00:15:53,616 --> 00:15:56,013
显然 凯西成功解决了这个难题
Evidently, Casey managed to solve that dilemma.

198
00:15:56,693 --> 00:16:00,249
就在他死之前 他把研究结果发给了我们
He sent us his research just before he was killed.

199
00:16:00,408 --> 00:16:02,407
很快打包完成 我们就给你送过去
Soon as it's packed up, we'll send it over.

200
00:16:02,566 --> 00:16:05,088
你会发现我们是很乐于助人的搭档的
I think you'll find that we'll be helpful partners.

201
00:16:05,244 --> 00:16:06,323
你没事吧 威尔?
You all right, Will?

202
00:16:06,483 --> 00:16:10,164
- 有事 他需要休息 这边应该没我们的事了  - 嗯
- No, he needs rest. I think we're done here.  - Mm.

203
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:12,682
- 抱歉  - 没事的
- I'm so sorry.  - No, that's fine.

204
00:16:12,837 --> 00:16:13,882
好
Okay.

205
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:38,658
威尔 嘿 嘿
Will, hey, hey.

206
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,892
坐起来 小心点
Come on, sit up. Be careful.

207
00:16:48,522 --> 00:16:50,998
我们第一反应肯定是感染
Our first thought is always infection.

208
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:53,965
但根据情况来看 我们扩大检查范围
But given the circumstances, we'll widen the search.

209
00:16:54,635 --> 00:16:56,521
会查出来的
We'll figure this out.

210
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,722
是一种叫钋的放射性同位素
It's an isotope called polonium.

211
00:17:33,877 --> 00:17:38,161
子弹肯定在其中浸过 伤口里找到了痕迹
The bullet must have been laced with it. There were traces of it in the wound.

212
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,748
怎么治呢?
Well, what's the treatment?

213
00:17:44,906 --> 00:17:46,871
这是放射性中毒
It's radiation poisoning.

214
00:17:47,064 --> 00:17:49,427
恐怕一旦进入血液系统...
I'm afraid that once it enters the bloodstream...

215
00:17:49,582 --> 00:17:51,785
便无可挽回了
the effect is irreversible.

216
00:17:51,979 --> 00:17:54,376
如果护理得当的话 大概...
With proper care we're looking at four...

217
00:17:54,536 --> 00:17:57,741
能活四至五周 然后他的身体便会死去
maybe five weeks, before his system shuts down.

218
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:18,361
我就在这儿
I'm right here.

219
00:18:25,866 --> 00:18:27,547
简直没有逻辑
It just doesn't make sense.

220
00:18:28,383 --> 00:18:32,224
他们害怕科技 因为其对人性造成威胁...
They're afraid of technology, because of its threat to humanity...

221
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:36,980
但他们剥夺别人的生命 却是眼睛都不眨
yet they don't flinch at taking a life.

222
00:18:37,135 --> 00:18:42,260
很明显逻辑并不是他们的强项
So obviously they're not big on logic.

223
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:45,057
但讽刺意味倒是不轻
But there's no shortage of irony.

224
00:18:46,965 --> 00:18:49,726
人们总是害怕自己所不了解的 一向如此
People fear what they don't understand. They always have.

225
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,640
约瑟夫送来了凯西的文档
Joseph sent over Casey's files.

226
00:18:55,077 --> 00:18:58,202
他当时正在解码突触
He was decoding the synapses in real time.

227
00:18:58,954 --> 00:19:01,317
但如果有正确的输入算法...
But with the right input algorithms...

228
00:19:03,788 --> 00:19:06,594
- 我得回实验室去  - 威尔...
- I need to get back to the lab.  - Will...

229
00:19:07,065 --> 00:19:11,462
你生命最后一个月就想那么度过吗?
is that really how you wanna spend the last month of your life?

230
00:20:06,446 --> 00:20:08,332
你干嘛呢?
Hey, what are you doing?

231
00:20:09,204 --> 00:20:12,999
我想把这些统统搬回办公室去...
I want to have all this taken back to the office...

232
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,285
告诉约瑟夫...
to tell Joseph...

233
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:19,081
我这一辈子都待在电脑实验室里...
that I've spent my entire life in a computer lab...

234
00:20:19,914 --> 00:20:23,231
我决定剩下的这些天就待在你身边
and I've decided I'd rather spend the rest of it with you.

235
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,187
依芙琳? 你还好吗?
Evelyn? Are you okay?

236
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:49,154
嗯 我想是吧
Yeah. Yeah, I suppose.

237
00:21:49,665 --> 00:21:51,868
他不能再工作了
Look, he can't work anymore.

238
00:21:52,063 --> 00:21:54,108
我们得把它关掉
We're gonna shut it down.

239
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,297
我觉得得给你说一声
I just wanted you to know.

240
00:21:57,498 --> 00:21:59,224
没问题
Of course.

241
00:21:59,535 --> 00:22:01,738
别担心PINN
Well, don't worry about PINN.

242
00:22:01,893 --> 00:22:03,460
照顾好威尔
Take care of Will.

243
00:22:03,691 --> 00:22:05,611
也照顾好自己
And take care of yourself.

244
00:22:07,048 --> 00:22:08,535
谢谢 约瑟夫
Thanks, Joe.

245
00:22:09,006 --> 00:22:12,006
有什么需要随时来找我 好吗?
Anything you need, I'm here, okay?

246
00:23:53,703 --> 00:23:56,908
这里全都是凯西为研究自我认知而建造的
It's all built off of Casey's solution to the self-awareness problem.

247
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,423
- 他在六个月前就做了  - 他具体做了什么?
- He did it six months ago.  - He did what exactly?

248
00:23:59,577 --> 00:24:03,940
他不是制造人工智能 而是复制生物体的意识
Instead of creating an artificial intelligence, he duplicated an existing one.

249
00:24:04,093 --> 00:24:05,330
你在开玩笑吧
Tell me you're joking.

250
00:24:05,492 --> 00:24:09,776
他记录了猴子的大脑活动 然后像一首歌或一部电影一样上传
He recorded the monkey's brain activity and uploaded it like a song or a movie.

251
00:24:09,927 --> 00:24:11,972
- 你疯了  - 威尔的身体快死了...
- You're out of your mind.  - Will's body is dying...

252
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:15,806
但他的思维是电子信号 我们可以上传到PINN...
but his mind is electrical signals that we can upload into PINN...

253
00:24:15,961 --> 00:24:18,358
依芙 他不是猴子
Ev, he's not a monkey.

254
00:24:20,597 --> 00:24:24,597
就算给他的大脑插上电极不会真的害死他...
Assuming that implanting an electrode into his brain doesn't actually kill him...

255
00:24:24,792 --> 00:24:29,076
就算成功了 最好的情况你也只是得到一个类似他的数据体
and that this works, at the very best you'll be making a digital approximation of him.

256
00:24:29,228 --> 00:24:33,228
如果我们出了差错... 任何差错 一个想法 一段童年的记忆...
If we missed anything... Anything. A thought, a childhood memory...

257
00:24:34,023 --> 00:24:36,465
你怎么知道你将面对的是什么?
How will you know what you're dealing with?

258
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:40,499
我的意思不是说要放弃
No one is saying that we give up.

259
00:24:40,736 --> 00:24:44,178
我们应该专注于纳米技术的研究 合成血细胞
We should be focusing our efforts on nanotechnology. Synthetic blood cells.

260
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:47,810
这都是几十年后的事情 我们现在只有这个技术
Both are decades away. This is what we have now.

261
00:24:48,329 --> 00:24:50,374
我们可以救他
We can save him.

262
00:24:53,524 --> 00:24:55,523
看看他们对他做了什么
Look at what they did to him.

263
00:25:10,388 --> 00:25:15,070
即使我知道自己是将死的人...
Even though I know I'm a dead man...

264
00:25:16,701 --> 00:25:18,904
我还是担心我会想念她
I'm worried I'll miss her.

265

但是你 如果我们不去尝试...
But you, you'll never hear the end of it...

268
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:39,086
你永远不会知道结果
if we don't try.

269
00:25:41,677 --> 00:25:43,278
我知道
I know.

270
00:25:49,509 --> 00:25:53,350

I'd like to think that I was smart enough to save you.

271
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:59,503
不要小看了自己

272
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:02,538
你是我知道的第三聪明的人
You're the third-smartest person I know.

273
00:26:54,005 --> 00:26:55,766
你确定要这么做吗?
Are you sure about this?

274
00:26:58,601 --> 00:27:00,726
用猴子做的实验很成功了

你的爱和陪伴是其他人梦寐以求的

PINN关机了

00:34:44,902 --> 00:34:46,989
{\an8}你能听见我说话吗?

337
00:35:03,484 --> 00:35:04,472
{\an8}依芙琳?

338
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,282
天啊

他看不见东西 摄像头 这里
He can't see anything. The camera. Here.

345
00:35:41,287 --> 00:35:43,446
好了 你现在能看见我吗?
There. Can you see me now?

346
00:35:46,882 --> 00:35:48,608
依芙琳...
Evelyn...

347
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:50,845

我这辈子唯一害怕的就是...
The only fear that I have...

349
00:35:59,069 --> 00:36:02,194
失去...
in life is the loss...

350
00:36:04,823 --> 00:36:08,948
如果真的会失去 真的失去的时候...
If it were to happen, when it does happen...

351
00:36:09,738 --> 00:36:12,305
最后一秒

最后一次看你的眼睛

353
00:36:16,013 --> 00:36:20,093
以此结束生命...
The possibility of that end...

354
00:36:21,047 --> 00:36:23,330
我好想你
I miss you so much.

355
00:36:25,523 --> 00:36:27,204
黑暗
Dark.

356
00:36:27,841 --> 00:36:31,080
我记得痛苦 却不记得我要说什么
I remember the pain, and I can't remember what I want to say.

357
00:36:31,238 --> 00:36:33,203
这就像从梦中醒来
It was like waking from a dream.

358
00:36:33,356 --> 00:36:36,242
这真的不可思议 我从来没有这种感觉
It was truly incredible. I've never felt anything like this.

359
00:36:36,392 --> 00:36:38,994
我没想过我会变成这样
I didn't think I could be like this.

360
00:36:39,149 --> 00:36:41,910
我的思维还在 但却没有...
Thoughts are there, but they don't...

361
00:36:42,067 --> 00:36:43,112
威尔?
Will?

362
00:36:43,266 --> 00:36:46,391
正确地组织起来
Arrive properly.

363
00:36:48,621 --> 00:36:52,143
我想他还是片段化的 我去检测一下
I think he's still fragmented. I'm gonna run a diagnostic.

364
00:36:53,255 --> 00:36:54,300
依芙琳...
Evelyn...

365
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,893
哦 我的天啊 他在重排他自己的编码
Oh, my God, he's reordering his own code.

366
00:37:04,285 --> 00:37:05,330
太不可思议了
It's incredible.

367
00:37:10,438 --> 00:37:13,119
- 我们怎么知道这就是他?  - 你在说什么?
- How do we know this is him?  - What are you talking about?

368
00:37:13,276 --> 00:37:14,718
我们用PINN的编码建立的这个
We built this from PINN's core.

369
00:37:14,914 --> 00:37:19,311
我们不知道有多少威尔的意识真正保存下来
We don't know how much of Will's consciousness actually survived.

370
00:37:22,787 --> 00:37:26,026
我将要扩展 需要更强的力量
I'm gonna need to expand. I need more power.

371
00:37:26,183 --> 00:37:29,978
新的处理器比现在这个系统的处理能力大三倍
New processor three times more capable than this current system.

372
00:37:30,139 --> 00:37:34,458
这些设计 我以前没有看到过
These designs. I just couldn't see it before.

373
00:37:34,615 --> 00:37:38,535
我无法描述它 这就像我的思维被释放了一样
I can't describe it. It's like my mind has been set free.

374
00:37:38,691 --> 00:37:40,417
帮我连上网
You need to get me online.

375
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:43,695
我要进入金融市场 教育数据库
I need to access financial markets, educational databases.

376
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:47,091
你能想象如果我们把他连上网络 他能做什么吗?
Can you imagine what he'd be capable of if we networked him?

377
00:37:47,282 --> 00:37:49,645
不 你在做什么?
No. What are you doing?

378
00:37:50,879 --> 00:37:53,526
他看不见也听不到了 我要重启他
He can't see or hear. I'm reconnecting him.

379
00:37:53,677 --> 00:37:55,994
这不是他 这不是
It's not him. It's not.

380
00:37:57,072 --> 00:37:59,958
它或许有智力 甚至有感知 但这不是威尔
It may be intelligent, may even be sentient, but this is not Will.

381
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:04,190
它才开启十五分钟 他就想侵入华尔街?
Fifteen minutes after it turns on, it wants to plug into Wall Street?

382
00:38:04,346 --> 00:38:06,629
变得更强大? 这听起来像是威尔吗?
Get more powerful? Does that sound like Will?

383
00:38:06,783 --> 00:38:08,748
那你怎么解释这些图像?
How do you explain these images?

384
00:38:08,901 --> 00:38:12,537
PINN可以通过代码获得视频片段
Stock footage PINN could have accessed from the cores.

385
00:38:12,698 --> 00:38:15,618
不 不是这样 那是富翁公园 我们第一次约会的时候 威尔带我去的
No, not that. That's Nabob Park. Will took me there on our first date.

386
00:38:15,774 --> 00:38:17,694
我说我喜欢旋转木马的音乐
I said that I liked the carousel music.

387
00:38:17,852 --> 00:38:20,579
第二天 他就拿着那个老式的录音机出现了
The next day, he shows up with that old record player.

388
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:21,775
这些都是记忆
These are memories.

389
00:38:21,928 --> 00:38:25,609
它们是真的 它们不是硬盘上的视频片段
They're real. They're not some stock video from some hard drive.

390
00:38:25,765 --> 00:38:26,810
这就是他
It's him.

391
00:38:26,964 --> 00:38:28,770
我只是说我们要谨慎一点
All I'm asking is that we're careful.

392
00:38:28,922 --> 00:38:33,047
- 弄清楚前先关了它...  - 关了它? 这可是威尔
- We shut it down until we know...  - Shut it down? It's Will.

393
00:38:34,636 --> 00:38:35,964
- 出去  - 我不能走...
- Get out.  - I can't do that...

394
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:38,000
滚出去!
Get out!

395
00:38:40,271 --> 00:38:41,350
你怎么能这么说?
How can you say that?

396
00:38:42,748 --> 00:38:44,395
出去
Get out.

397
00:39:02,808 --> 00:39:04,409
依芙琳?
Evelyn?

398
00:39:08,123 --> 00:39:10,043
马克斯在哪里?
Where's Max?

399
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,966
他得走了
He had to go.

400
00:39:17,115 --> 00:39:19,921
马克斯很疑惑 是不是?
Max is confused, isn't he?

401
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,833
他很担心
He's concerned.

402
00:39:26,944 --> 00:39:29,181
你担心吗?
Are you concerned?

403
00:39:42,969 --> 00:39:44,536
不
No.

404
00:40:01,151 --> 00:40:02,991
沃特斯博士?
Dr. Waters?

405
00:40:03,389 --> 00:40:05,309
我能跟你谈谈吗?
Can I talk to you?

406
00:40:06,706 --> 00:40:10,626
下班好久了 你怎么不打电话到我的办公室? 约个时间
It's after hours. Why don't you call my office? Set up an appointment.

407
00:40:10,781 --> 00:40:12,303
我叫布里
Bree.

408
00:40:15,177 --> 00:40:17,176
我是你手下的一名学生
I'm a student of your work.

很多科学家都没有意识到这点
Most men of science are blind to it.

412
00:40:33,319 --> 00:40:35,602
你究竟想要什么?

弄明白一些东西
Just some clarity.

414
00:40:38,714 --> 00:40:40,997
我知道这很难
I know it's difficult.

415

你的同事...
Most of your colleagues...

416
00:40:44,148 --> 00:40:46,750
还有你最好的朋友

417
00:40:48,664 --> 00:40:50,504
他们没有意识到危险
They don't know the danger.

418
00:40:51,861 --> 00:40:54,337
写论文是一回事
Writing a paper is one thing.

419
00:40:55,738 --> 00:40:57,897
我想知道你心里怎么想的

我不知道你怎么找到我的...

但不管你想要什么...

422
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,486
我都没有兴趣 失陪

423
00:41:14,678 --> 00:41:16,325
这很重要
This is important.

424
00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:18,157

We know she took the PINN cores and we know about Casey's files.

427

我们知道你造的是什么
We know what you're building.

428
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:26,177
你不明白 是吗?
You don't get it, do you?

429

她把它连上网络以后 它可以在世界上任何一台电脑上自我复制...
She connects it to the Internet, it'll copy itself onto every computer in the world...

430
00:42:30,564 --> 00:42:33,723
- 到那时就没有什么能阻止它了  - 她在哪里?
- and then there is no taking it down.  - Where is she?

431
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:37,279
"连医师都被电脑程序师取代的未来是危险的
"The danger is a future where doctors are technicians, not physicians.

432
00:42:37,916 --> 00:42:41,358
机器是用来帮助人类 而不是取代人类的"
Machines are meant to aid the human mind, not supplant it."

433
00:42:41,513 --> 00:42:43,478
这是你的原话
They're your words.

434

我们早就做好准备了
We prepared for this.

493
00:48:55,425 --> 00:48:58,391
这地方叫布赖特伍德
The town is called Brightwood.

494
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,826
虽然看上去不咋样...
Doesn't look like much...

495
00:49:02,978 --> 00:49:05,295
但在这儿建个基地是最佳之选
but it's the perfect place to build.

496
00:49:18,323 --> 00:49:19,845
我不太明白
I don't get it.

497
00:49:21,878 --> 00:49:25,844
我觉得我们有机会在这儿将会大展宏图
I think we have an opportunity to do great things here.

498

你们想建立地下数据库

499
00:49:39,301 --> 00:49:43,857
还要重新装修镇子上所有的设备
And you want me to renovate nearly every structure in town.

500
00:49:44,017 --> 00:49:45,425

Mm-hm.

501
00:49:45,576 --> 00:49:47,496
我只有六个人手

雇多点
Hire more.

503
00:49:52,248 --> 00:49:54,407
说实话 女士 布赖特伍德就是个垃圾场
Look, ma'am, in all honesty, Brightwood's a dump.

504
00:49:54,566 --> 00:49:57,406
我不确定为什么你想在这儿浪费钱
I'm not even sure why you'd want to waste your money here.

505
00:49:57,564 --> 00:50:00,040
你们确定选对地方了吗?

And by the time you and I are done talking, we'll own this diner.

509
00:50:08,912 --> 00:50:10,354
我们会留下来
We're staying.

510
00:50:10,551 --> 00:50:12,516
而且我想让你为我工作
We would like you to work for us.

511
00:50:12,669 --> 00:50:15,430
报价随便你说 我们不会嫌贵的

512
00:50:19,342 --> 00:50:21,421
嗯 好吧
Ahem. Okay.

513

515
00:51:13,568 --> 00:51:17,329
你知道吗 我以前在汤马斯·凯西那工作

516
00:51:18,044 --> 00:51:20,089
在那儿实习
I interned for him.

517
00:51:26,796 --> 00:51:29,159
有天晚上 他邀请我们去他的实验室...
One night, he invites us all over to the lab...

518
00:51:29,912 --> 00:51:32,639
给我们讲了研究历程...
gives us this whole speech about history...

519
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:34,710
倒香槟给各位...
hands out champagne...

520
00:51:34,868 --> 00:51:37,344
开心得像是他能治愈癌症一样
like he just cured cancer.

521
00:51:38,225 --> 00:51:41,111
你知道吗 当他亲手上传那只猴子的意识时...
You know, when he uploaded that rhesus monkey...

522
00:51:41,302 --> 00:51:43,461
我当时为他感到高兴
I was actually happy for him.

523
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:44,778
我们都为他高兴
We all were.

524
00:51:46,776 --> 00:51:50,821
后来我意识到 我们做过头了
And then I realized we had crossed a line.

525
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:56,055
那台装有猴子意识的机器 从未呼吸过
The machine that thought it was a monkey never took a breath.

526
00:51:57,206 --> 00:51:59,853
不吃东西 也不睡觉
It never ate, never slept.

527
00:52:00,323 --> 00:52:02,322
它只是一直尖叫
It just screamed.

528
00:52:04,918 --> 00:52:07,838
像是在乞求我们停下
It was begging for us to stop.

529
00:52:08,874 --> 00:52:10,873
关掉它
To shut it down.

530
00:52:15,388 --> 00:52:18,228
我们中的少数人聚在一起谈了一下
A small group of us would get together and talk.

531
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:22,631
主要探讨了关于您的观点
Mostly about your philosophy.

532
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:26,262
以及顾虑
And your concerns.

533
00:52:33,251 --> 00:52:35,296
我想应该把这件事告诉你
I thought you should know.

534
00:52:49,075 --> 00:52:50,597
什么?
What?

535
00:52:52,111 --> 00:52:56,236
PINN本身不会去分辨对错 或是表示忠心 对吧?
PINN could never distinguish between right and wrong, demonstrate loyalty, right?

536
00:52:56,427 --> 00:52:59,552
凯西赋予机器自我意识的办法
Casey's solution to the problem of self-awareness:

537
00:52:59,704 --> 00:53:01,590
是向机器输入已知生物的意识
Use an existing mind.

538
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:05,663
不会的
No.

539
00:53:08,815 --> 00:53:12,257
所以你想创造一个上帝吗?
So you wanna create a god?

540
00:53:12,412 --> 00:53:14,491
你自己的上帝?
Your own god?

541
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:16,615
这个问题很不错
That's a very good question.

542
00:53:16,768 --> 00:53:18,210
嗯...
Um...

543
00:53:18,366 --> 00:53:21,683
这不是人类一直在做的事情吗?
Isn't that what man has always done?

544
00:54:02,283 --> 00:54:04,885
他们正在这里大兴土木
They're building something big out there.

545
00:54:36,929 --> 00:54:38,690
它在那干什么?
What's it doing out there?

546
00:54:41,564 --> 00:54:46,359
这东西就像其他的智慧生物
This thing is like any intelligence.

547
00:54:48,077 --> 00:54:51,077
它需要成长 进化
It needs to grow. To advance.

548
00:54:54,871 --> 00:55:00,348
现在 他找到一个它认为安全的地方
Right now, it's settling somewhere it thinks it's safe from outside threats.

549
00:55:02,064 --> 00:55:06,461
一个能让它获取大量能量的地方
Somewhere its massive appetite for power can be met.

550
00:55:09,736 --> 00:55:12,463
但是它的野心绝不止这些
But it will want more than that.

551
00:55:20,565 --> 00:55:23,292
时间长了 它将不会只满足于生存
After a while survival won't be enough.

552
00:55:27,239 --> 00:55:32,921
它会扩张 继续进化 直到影响...
It will expand, evolve, influence...

553
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:37,915
整个世界为止
perhaps the entire world.

554
00:55:39,987 --> 00:55:41,588
卡斯特夫人?
Mrs. Caster?

555
00:55:41,745 --> 00:55:45,267
一号二号已经安装完毕 六七号明天就会完成
One and two are online. Six and seven will be on tomorrow.

556
00:55:46,021 --> 00:55:47,668
那我们如何阻止它?
So how do we stop it?

557
00:55:48,938 --> 00:55:50,619
你做不到
You can't.

558
00:55:51,855 --> 00:55:55,650
人不够 现在也不是时候
Not all alone. And not now.

559
00:55:56,650 --> 00:55:59,933
等待它越走越远 等待人们意识到危险
Wait for it to go too far. Wait for people to wake up.

560
00:56:00,327 --> 00:56:01,769
不
No.

561
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:04,570
我们没有时间等待
We don't have time to wait.

562
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,205
我们得过去
We have to move closer.

563
00:56:30,177 --> 00:56:31,983
欢迎回家
Welcome home.

564
00:57:00,747 --> 00:57:02,587
这是那首...?
Is that the same...?

565
00:57:03,425 --> 00:57:04,867
没错
Yup.

566
00:57:06,262 --> 00:57:07,420
就是当年那首
It's the same one.

567
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:11,023
你想要一瓶红酒吗?
Would you like a glass of wine?

568
00:57:14,094 --> 00:57:15,581
待会吧
In a minute.

569
00:57:29,758 --> 00:57:32,200
你记不记得我们第一次见面?
Do you remember when we first met?

570
00:57:36,472 --> 00:57:38,471
我记得所有事情
I remember everything.

571
00:57:40,908 --> 00:57:46,068
你在4月16号周二的那天去上约瑟夫的课
You walked into Joseph's class on Tuesday, April 16th.

572
00:57:47,261 --> 00:57:51,306
前一天晚上下过雨 但那天天气晴朗
Rained the night before, but that day the sun was out.

573
00:57:52,416 --> 00:57:55,222
约瑟夫说你并不是我的般配...
Joseph said you were out of my league...

574
00:57:56,213 --> 00:57:58,450
但我就喜欢挑战
but I always liked a challenge.

575
00:58:03,805 --> 00:58:06,930
你是我见过最美的女人
You were the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen.

576
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:53,519
你没事吧?
You all right?

577
00:58:54,115 --> 00:58:57,001
嗯 嗯
Yeah, yeah.

578
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:25,654
两年后

579
00:59:52,059 --> 00:59:53,626
看一下
Take a look.

580
00:59:57,013 --> 00:59:59,853
我们在纳米科技方面有了重大进展
We've made a breakthrough with the nanotechnology.

581
01:00:00,011 --> 01:00:04,852
我们可以更快的生产任何材质
We can rebuild any material faster than before.

582
01:00:05,006 --> 01:00:10,642
比如合成干细胞 组织再生
Synthetic stem cells, tissue regeneration.

583
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:13,324
非同凡响
It's extraordinary.

584
01:00:15,635 --> 01:00:17,838
刚看上去可能会觉得吓人
They'll be scared at first.

585
01:00:17,993 --> 01:00:20,754
但是当人们意识到这项技术的应用...
But once they see what the technology can do...

586
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:25,115
我想他们会欢迎的 这会改变他们的生活
I think that they will embrace it. And I think it will change their lives.

587
01:00:38,633 --> 01:00:43,368
布赖特伍德真相 数据中心在拿你们做试验 停止人体试验

588
01:01:04,107 --> 01:01:06,344
输入命令
Enter command.

589
01:01:06,505 --> 01:01:07,550
安全码
Security code.

590
01:01:10,062 --> 01:01:11,220
身份
Status.

591
01:01:14,698 --> 01:01:16,981
你吓我一跳
Scared the shit out of me.

592
01:01:17,134 --> 01:01:18,462
不好意思
Sorry.

593
01:01:19,972 --> 01:01:21,653
德雷克 我拿到了 走
Drake, I got it. Come on.

594
01:01:21,850 --> 01:01:23,497
我拿到钱了 走
I got the money. Come on.

595
01:01:24,687 --> 01:01:27,004
- 快走  - 哈哈哈
- Let's go.  - Ha-ha-ha.

596
01:01:30,642 --> 01:01:32,607
把他放到桌子上 
Put him on the table, please.

597
01:01:32,759 --> 01:01:35,440
放这儿 放他上去 小心
Here. Put him on the table. Careful, careful.

598
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:38,718
- 现在 请退后  - 退后
- Now step back.  - Step back.

599
01:01:39,473 --> 01:01:41,279
这是在干嘛?
What the hell's happening?

600
01:01:42,350 --> 01:01:44,395
这些人应该去外面等待 依芙琳
These men should wait outside, Evelyn.

601
01:01:44,588 --> 01:01:47,713
- 快点  - 你们对他在做什么?
- Come on now.  - What are you doing to him?

602
01:01:47,904 --> 01:01:49,266
我们在救他
We're saving him.

603
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:24,097
你不害怕我 对吧?
You're not afraid, are you?

604
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:25,976
不会
No. Heh.

605
01:03:26,127 --> 01:03:27,694
我的手下像见了鬼似的
My crew got a little spooked.

606
01:03:30,124 --> 01:03:31,169
你觉得如何?
How are you?

607
01:03:32,482 --> 01:03:33,844
更好了
Better.

608
01:03:37,197 --> 01:03:40,480
体力上的增强只是第一步 
The physical enhancements are just the start.

609
01:03:41,272 --> 01:03:42,953
什么意思?
What do you mean?

610
01:03:44,869 --> 01:03:47,266
我进入了他的意识
He's also connected to me.

611
01:03:51,703 --> 01:03:53,702
是我 依芙琳
It's me, Evelyn.

612
01:03:55,579 --> 01:03:57,499
我现在可以触摸到你了
I can touch you now.

613
01:03:57,656 --> 01:03:59,496
天哪
Oh, Jesus.

614
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:01,622
依芙琳...
Evelyn...

615
01:04:01,812 --> 01:04:04,254
不 我不行
No. No. No, I can't.

616
01:04:04,450 --> 01:04:06,449
- 依芙琳  -我不行
- Evelyn.  - I can't.

617
01:04:55,959 --> 01:04:57,401
又做梦了?
Another dream?

618
01:04:58,357 --> 01:05:00,322
嗯
Yeah. Yeah.

619
01:05:00,475 --> 01:05:02,951
我昨晚上又有重大进展
I made a breakthrough last night.

620
01:05:03,112 --> 01:05:05,077
我想你应该会高兴
I think you'll be very pleased.

621
01:05:06,828 --> 01:05:08,395
好
Okay.

622
01:05:08,547 --> 01:05:09,830
等我换个衣服
I'll get dressed.

623
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:57,147
看一下
Take a look.

624
01:05:59,817 --> 01:06:01,976
这肯定有800多磅
That's gotta weigh 800 pounds.

625
01:06:46,171 --> 01:06:49,011
欢迎 很高兴你能过来
Welcome. We're glad you're here.

626
01:07:22,535 --> 01:07:24,296
这些人过来干什么的?
What are all these people doing here?

627
01:07:24,453 --> 01:07:27,692
RIFT在网上公开了马丁搬东西的视频
RIFT posted a video of Martin online.

628
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:29,053
迅速流传开来
It went viral.

629
01:07:29,208 --> 01:07:31,253
你是说你让视频流传出去的?
You mean you let it go viral?

630
01:07:31,526 --> 01:07:34,685
这些人正遭受痛苦 依芙琳
These people are suffering, Evelyn.

631
01:07:34,843 --> 01:07:35,888
他们没有了希望
They have no hope.

632
01:07:37,361 --> 01:07:39,678
而我可以帮他们治疗
And I'm able to fix them.

633
01:07:40,398 --> 01:07:43,364
但是有些人不理解
But there are others who don't understand.

634
01:07:43,994 --> 01:07:46,391
现在是时候让大家都知道了
It's time for everybody to see.

635
01:08:26,552 --> 01:08:28,994
- 布坎南探员  - 卡斯特博士
- Agent Buchanan.  - Dr. Caster.

636
01:08:29,190 --> 01:08:30,712
约瑟夫
Joseph.

637
01:08:30,868 --> 01:08:33,549
很高兴见到你 依芙琳
It's so good to see you, Evelyn.

638
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:37,863
我也是 请跟我来
Good to see you too. Follow me.

639
01:08:43,376 --> 01:08:45,422
这间实验中心在地下五层
The facility is five stories down so

640
01:08:45,423 --> 01:08:47,819
目的是为了能够控制室内的温度
that we can control the temperature in the lab.

641
01:09:01,718 --> 01:09:05,354
欢迎 很高兴你们能来
Welcome. We're glad you're here.

642
01:09:05,514 --> 01:09:07,559
老天啊
Jesus Christ.

643
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:10,078
威尔?
Will?

644
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:12,354
见到我很吃惊吗 约瑟夫?
You surprised to see me, Joseph?

645
01:09:14,585 --> 01:09:16,107
嗯...
Um...

646
01:09:17,542 --> 01:09:18,621
这得看情况
That depends.

647
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:21,461
什么情况?
On what?

648
01:09:24,055 --> 01:09:26,577
你能证明你有自我意识吗?
Can you prove you're self-aware?

649
01:09:29,130 --> 01:09:32,255
这个问题很难 坦格博士
That's a difficult question, Dr. Tagger.

650
01:09:32,927 --> 01:09:35,086
你能证明你有意识吗?
Can you prove that you are?

651
01:09:37,842 --> 01:09:40,967
显然他还没有失去幽默感
Well, he certainly hasn't lost his sense of humor.

652
01:09:57,542 --> 01:09:59,905
量子处理器
Quantum processors.

653
01:10:02,857 --> 01:10:04,219
这太令人吃惊了
This is astounding.

654
01:10:05,095 --> 01:10:07,254
这些都是基于PINN的技术?
Is all this based on PINN?

655
01:10:08,013 --> 01:10:10,615
我们的技术已经超过那时候了
We've moved well beyond that now.

656
01:10:15,764 --> 01:10:19,889
保罗从出生就是一个瞎子
Paul has been blind since birth.

657
01:10:26,474 --> 01:10:29,394
纳米技术用于损坏的细胞...
The nanotechnology targets the damaged cells...

658
01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:33,513
将其修复和再生
and repairs and regenerates them.

659
01:10:54,926 --> 01:10:56,766
天呐
Oh, God.

660
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:02,287
天呐
Oh, God.

661
01:11:06,235 --> 01:11:07,722
我们没有隐藏什么
We're not hiding anything.

662
01:11:08,792 --> 01:11:12,712
这些人都是自发而来 让我们帮助他们
These people all came on their own, looking for us to help them.

663
01:11:12,869 --> 01:11:14,630
我们帮助了他们
So we did.

664
01:11:15,626 --> 01:11:18,626
他们现在体力增强 体质得到改善 并互相连接
Now they're all enhanced, modified and networked.

665
01:11:20,021 --> 01:11:23,463
他们能各行其事 也可以整体行动
They remain autonomous, but they can also act in unison.

666
01:11:23,618 --> 01:11:25,344
就像大脑的各个部分
Part of a collective mind.

667
01:11:26,415 --> 01:11:28,414
实在令人大吃一惊 威尔
This is staggering, Will.

668
01:11:28,613 --> 01:11:32,090
事实上 这项计划还处于发展期
Actually, it's still in its infancy.

669
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:36,455
你们所见到的只是未来的冰山一角 
What you're seeing is just a small taste of what we'll achieve.

670
01:11:36,605 --> 01:11:40,605
我们原本害怕这对人们来说难以承受
We were afraid that it would be too much for people...

671
01:11:40,761 --> 01:11:43,488
但是我想这正在改变
but I think that's changing now.

672
01:11:49,832 --> 01:11:51,399
依芙琳...
Evelyn...

673
01:11:53,149 --> 01:11:55,035
你还好吗?
Are you all right?

674
01:11:58,264 --> 01:12:00,627
我现在已经实现我当初的梦想
I've gotten everything I ever asked for.

675
01:12:08,693 --> 01:12:10,021
好的
Okay.

676
01:12:11,211 --> 01:12:13,336
- 再见  - 再见
- Bye.  - Bye.

677
01:12:29,193 --> 01:12:31,318
逃离这里

678
01:12:56,726 --> 01:12:58,691
你觉得那玩意是他吗?
You think it's really him?

679
01:12:59,164 --> 01:13:01,606
很明显他的意识已经大幅进化了...
Clearly his mind has evolved so radically...

680
01:13:01,801 --> 01:13:04,368
是不是他已经并不重要了
I'm not sure it matters anymore.

681
01:13:04,958 --> 01:13:08,163
那么 不管那个是什么东西...
Well, whoever or whatever it is...

682
01:13:08,315 --> 01:13:11,598
- 它在建立一只军队  - 没错
- it's building an army out there.  - Yeah.

683
01:13:12,710 --> 01:13:14,471
我们得通知首府
We need to call Washington.

684
01:13:34,849 --> 01:13:36,450
他在改造更多的人
He's made more of them.

685
01:13:38,885 --> 01:13:40,964
我们称之为"混血人"
We called them "Hybrids."

686
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:45,080
你觉得人们会听我们的吗?
You think people will listen now?

687
01:13:46,077 --> 01:13:48,122
我知道某人会
I know someone who might.

688
01:13:48,275 --> 01:13:50,672
我们得低调处理此事
We need to keep this small.

689
01:13:50,833 --> 01:13:52,514
不想让大众恐慌
We don't want widespread panic.

690
01:13:53,271 --> 01:13:57,271
我们不会和恐怖组织谈判 更不会和他们合作
Generally, we don't negotiate with terrorists, much less join forces with them.

691
01:13:57,427 --> 01:13:59,710
瞧 我知道这很不寻常...
Look, I know it's unusual...

692
01:14:00,143 --> 01:14:02,188
但我们亲眼所见 这确实是一个威胁
but we've seen it. It's a legit threat.

693
01:14:02,381 --> 01:14:04,948
两天以前 这个人...
Now, two days ago, this guy...

694
01:14:05,458 --> 01:14:07,383
被打的差一点就死掉
was beaten to within an inch of his life. 

695
01:14:07,385 --> 01:14:11,380
然后这个视频出现在上百个网站上
Then this pops up on a few hundred sites.

696
01:14:11,573 --> 01:14:14,334
- 这些人都由电脑控制?  - 嗯
- And the computer controls this?  - Mm-hm.

697
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:16,609
能阻止这台人工智能电脑的...
The only way to stop it...

698
01:14:17,167 --> 01:14:19,007
只有关闭所有互联网络
is to shut down the Internet.

699
01:14:19,165 --> 01:14:22,528
就是说 我们得关掉所有联网设备的电源
Basically, cut power to every networked hard drive on Earth.

700
01:14:22,682 --> 01:14:24,602
就像千年虫一样
It's Y2K.

701
01:14:25,559 --> 01:14:27,046
好吧
Right.

702
01:14:27,677 --> 01:14:29,836
那为什么需要那些恐怖分子?
And why do we need the terrorists?

703
01:14:31,792 --> 01:14:36,155
如果事情失去控制了 就让他们背黑锅
We're all gonna need someone to blame when this thing goes sideways.

704
01:14:36,987 --> 01:14:38,713
事态早就失去控制了
It's already sideways.

705
01:15:09,116 --> 01:15:11,081
你写的字真的很丑
You've got terrible handwriting.

706
01:15:11,234 --> 01:15:14,359
自从离开学校 我就很少亲手写字了
I haven't handwritten anything since I was at school.

707
01:15:14,511 --> 01:15:17,750
但这是我能想到的唯一的安全联络方式
But it was the only secure way I could think of reaching you.

708
01:15:19,866 --> 01:15:21,991
他们是如何说服你的?
How did they turn you?

709
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:27,706
- 依芙琳如何?  - 她还没有认清那东西的本质
- How's Evelyn?  - She can't see it for what it is.

710
01:15:28,936 --> 01:15:30,173
你认清了?
But you can?

711
01:15:32,173 --> 01:15:34,093
你信上说 你能阻止它
Your letter says you can stop it.

712
01:15:34,251 --> 01:15:37,773
如果这些"混血人"是互相关联的...
If those Hybrids are networked...

713
01:15:37,927 --> 01:15:40,324
那他们的控制程序是我帮忙编写的
they're running on software I helped write.

714
01:15:40,485 --> 01:15:44,087
我能入侵那软件并植入病毒
Software I can hack to build a virus.

715
01:15:44,281 --> 01:15:45,962
但首先我们要抓到一只"混血人"
That would require capturing one.

716
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:49,364
这就得让你在政府部门的朋友协助我了
Which would require help from your friends in the government.

717
01:15:51,475 --> 01:15:52,520
是的
Yes.

718
01:15:52,672 --> 01:15:54,989
我们需要不会被干扰的机器
We need hardware the machine can't interfere with.

719
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:58,036
需要的是没有集成电路 甚至没有自动锁的东西
Nothing with a microchip. Not even power-locks.

720
01:17:00,046 --> 01:17:01,966
好吃吗?
How's the food?

721
01:17:02,124 --> 01:17:04,010
还不错 谢谢
Fine. Thank you.

722
01:17:08,998 --> 01:17:10,645
怎么了?
What is it?

723
01:17:11,116 --> 01:17:13,558
没什么 只是...
Nothing. Just...

724
01:17:13,714 --> 01:17:16,316
我不太想讲话
I don't really feel like talking.

725
01:17:17,749 --> 01:17:19,271
哦
Oh.

726
01:17:32,934 --> 01:17:36,820
威尔 你能不能别这样?
Will, can you not do that, please?

727
01:17:38,689 --> 01:17:41,495
我以为这样会让你更自在
I thought it might make you feel more comfortable.

728
01:17:45,962 --> 01:17:47,802
这样好点吗?
Is that better?

729
01:17:49,797 --> 01:17:51,284
好多了
Yes.

730
01:18:26,841 --> 01:18:29,408
依芙琳 我要给你看点东西
Evelyn, I need to show you something.

731
01:18:29,559 --> 01:18:31,081
现在不是时候
Not now.

732
01:18:32,196 --> 01:18:34,479
我不要看
I'm not doing this.

733
01:18:38,749 --> 01:18:41,271
我不能理解 依芙琳
I don't understand, Evelyn.

734
01:18:42,186 --> 01:18:44,583
这些是你的梦想 这是我们的未来
These are your dreams. This is our future.

735
01:18:44,784 --> 01:18:47,226
不 这不是我们的未来
No, this is not our future.

736
01:18:47,381 --> 01:18:50,620
你没有和我在一起 你现在不在这儿
You're not here with me. You're not here now.

737
01:18:52,575 --> 01:18:54,381
你变了
You've changed.

738
01:18:57,491 --> 01:18:59,854
你不爱我了吗?
Have you fallen out of love with me?

739
01:19:01,847 --> 01:19:02,892
不是
No.

740
01:19:04,045 --> 01:19:05,771
你不爱了吗?
Have you?

741
01:19:09,918 --> 01:19:12,565
不是 不是的
No. No.

742
01:19:12,716 --> 01:19:15,636
我只是需要点时间想想
I just need time to think.

743
01:19:19,110 --> 01:19:24,235
你体内的催产素和血清素的比例不太正常
The balance of oxytocin and serotonin in your system is unusual.

744
01:19:25,663 --> 01:19:29,788
你...? 你在监控我的激素吗?
Are you...? Are you measuring my hormones?

745
01:19:29,939 --> 01:19:31,984
我只是想和你感同身受
I'm trying to empathize.

746
01:19:32,137 --> 01:19:34,216
情绪其实就是生化反应过程
Biochemistry is emotion.

747
01:19:35,334 --> 01:19:37,537
你有我哪些资料都给我看 现在
Show me everything you have. Now.

748
01:19:39,091 --> 01:19:41,567
- 为什么?  - 现在
- Why?  - Now.

749
01:19:54,755 --> 01:19:58,277
不 威尔 这不对
No, Will, this is wrong.

750
01:19:59,510 --> 01:20:04,749
这是我的想法 是我的感受
These are my thoughts. These are my feelings.

751
01:20:05,744 --> 01:20:07,823
谁允许你这样
You're not allowed.

752
01:20:08,821 --> 01:20:10,229
依芙琳?
Evelyn?

753
01:20:24,246 --> 01:20:26,722
我很抱歉 但是我觉得你没有理解
I'm sorry, but I don't think you understand.

754
01:20:26,883 --> 01:20:28,405
别现在说
Not now.

755
01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:51,261
依芙琳!
Evelyn!

756
01:20:52,018 --> 01:20:53,063
马克斯?
Max?

757
01:20:53,217 --> 01:20:55,819
- 你们不必这样  - 站在那儿别动
- There's no need for this.  - Stop where you are.

758
01:20:58,932 --> 01:21:00,499
- 放下枪 马克斯  - 不!
- Put down the gun, Max.  - No!

759
01:21:02,248 --> 01:21:04,407
- 依芙琳 过来  - 你为什么这么恐惧?
- Evelyn, come here.  - Why are you so afraid of this?

760
01:21:06,044 --> 01:21:07,566
不
No.

761
01:21:22,468 --> 01:21:24,115
放下枪 马克斯
Put down the gun, Max.

762
01:21:27,384 --> 01:21:28,429
开枪
Shoot him.

763
01:21:30,141 --> 01:21:31,822
别动
Don't move.

764
01:21:53,398 --> 01:21:54,999
依芙琳
Evelyn.

765
01:21:57,314 --> 01:21:59,040
依芙琳 过来
Evelyn, come here.

766
01:21:59,232 --> 01:22:00,879
依芙琳 过我们这儿
Evelyn, come with us.

767
01:22:01,031 --> 01:22:02,393
- 我们走  - 进去
- Let's go.  - Get inside.

768
01:22:02,549 --> 01:22:04,514
- 走 走  - 我们走
- Go. Go.  - Let's go.

769
01:22:13,098 --> 01:22:14,221
走
Go.

770
01:22:40,231 --> 01:22:43,310
他们是脱离科技组织的现役军人
There are active military personnel with RIFT.

771
01:22:43,468 --> 01:22:45,671
这已经太离谱了 你们必须停下来
This has gone too far. You have to stop it.

772
01:22:45,826 --> 01:22:49,985
- 他们不可能赢的  - "他们"可是人啊 住手吧
- There's no way they can win.  - "They" are people. Stop it.

773
01:23:07,365 --> 01:23:09,444
他和我们断开了网络连接 失联了
We're not connected to him anymore. He's gone.

774
01:23:09,603 --> 01:23:10,806
开火
Fire.

775
01:23:19,713 --> 01:23:22,315
马丁拿走了我的源代码
Martin has my source code.

776
01:23:23,469 --> 01:23:25,594
他们会用源代码来创造一种病毒
They'll use it to build a virus now.

777
01:23:26,826 --> 01:23:28,871
我们在做什么 威尔?
What are we doing, Will?

778
01:23:30,622 --> 01:23:31,950
我们没法跟们他抗争
We can't fight them.

779
01:23:32,101 --> 01:23:34,100
我们不会跟他们抗争的
We're not gonna fight them.

780
01:23:35,537 --> 01:23:37,582
我们会超越他们
We're gonna transcend them.

781
01:24:59,495 --> 01:25:00,574
依芙琳
Evelyn.

782
01:25:03,171 --> 01:25:04,658
这是什么?
What is this?

783
01:25:06,368 --> 01:25:08,571
这就是我想让你看的
It's what I wanted you to see.

784
01:25:09,405 --> 01:25:11,370
这是重建
It's regeneration.

785
01:25:12,722 --> 01:25:14,687
这是进化
It's evolution.

786
01:25:20,315 --> 01:25:22,076
你要去哪儿?
Where are you going?

787
01:25:22,232 --> 01:25:24,072
这里不安全
It's not safe here.

788
01:25:25,709 --> 01:25:27,231
我可以上传你
I can upload you.

789
01:25:27,387 --> 01:25:29,512
我可以保护你
I can protect you from them.

790
01:25:30,065 --> 01:25:32,224
我不怕他们
I'm not afraid of them.

791
01:25:37,896 --> 01:25:40,975
别走 依芙琳 拜托了
Don't leave, Evelyn. Please.

792
01:25:43,491 --> 01:25:45,377
我们可以在一起
We can be together.

793
01:26:28,287 --> 01:26:30,013
他在大量出血
He's bleeding out.

794
01:26:31,124 --> 01:26:32,691
他快不行了
We're losing him.

795
01:26:33,882 --> 01:26:38,121
嘿 如果你不让我联网 我会死的
Hey. If you don't connect me, I'll die.

796
01:26:40,516 --> 01:26:41,674
我不能这么做
I can't.

797
01:26:41,874 --> 01:26:43,441
血止不住
It's not stopping.

798
01:26:46,070 --> 01:26:47,990
四升氧气
Four liters O2.

799
01:26:51,145 --> 01:26:53,382
脉搏减弱 他快不行了
Pulse is dropping. We're losing him.

800
01:27:18,158 --> 01:27:20,123
她离开沙漠了
She's left the desert.

801
01:27:20,276 --> 01:27:21,713
- 他在哪儿?  - 在14号
- Where is she?  - She's on the 14.

802
01:27:23,033 --> 01:27:24,520
那是什么?
What the hell was that?

803
01:28:40,357 --> 01:28:42,038
不
No.

804
01:28:45,752 --> 01:28:47,955
我知道你很生气 依芙琳
I know you're angry, Evelyn.

805
01:28:48,510 --> 01:28:50,350
马丁在哪儿?
Where's Martin?

806
01:28:50,588 --> 01:28:54,633
- 我要和马丁说话  - 真正的马丁几个月前就死了
- I want to talk to Martin. - The real Martin died months ago.

807
01:28:54,983 --> 01:28:57,186
剩下的这一部分他也不再有痛苦
What's left of him is no longer in pain.

808
01:29:01,576 --> 01:29:03,575
你... ? 你对他做了什么?
What did you...? What did you do to him?

809
01:29:03,734 --> 01:29:06,210
我们还回去了他的人性
We gave him back his humanity.

810
01:29:08,330 --> 01:29:10,533
- 你到底做了什么?  - 放轻松
- What did you do?  - Take it easy.

811
01:29:10,687 --> 01:29:12,766
放开我 放开我
Get off me. Just get off me.

812
01:29:19,079 --> 01:29:22,760
他曾经那么相信你 我也是
He trusted you. I trusted you.

813
01:29:24,434 --> 01:29:28,150
- 我们只是想帮忙  - 不 你袭击了我们
- We're just trying to help.  - No. You attacked us.

814
01:29:30,628 --> 01:29:32,309
依芙琳...
Evelyn...

815
01:29:32,706 --> 01:29:34,705
我给你看点东西
let me show you something.

816
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:40,466
这是雨水
It's rainwater.

817
01:29:57,042 --> 01:29:58,848
那东西就在水里
It's in the rain.

818
01:29:58,999 --> 01:30:00,725
继续看
Keep watching.

819
01:30:05,154 --> 01:30:09,279
它无所不能 他可以自我复制
Everywhere it can, it builds copies of itself.

820
01:30:10,389 --> 01:30:15,025
这些粒子参与空气循环 空气循环将它们带到地球的每个角落
Particles join the air currents, which carry them all over the surface of the planet.

821
01:30:16,702 --> 01:30:20,418
它们在天空中 在陆地上
It's in the sky. It's in the land.

822
01:30:21,218 --> 01:30:22,944
在水中
In the water.

823
01:30:23,096 --> 01:30:24,902
无处不在
It's everywhere.

824
01:30:25,054 --> 01:30:29,213
在明年夏天之前 我想这机器会遍布整个地球
By next summer, we think the machine could have encased the entire planet.

825
01:30:29,370 --> 01:30:30,937
为什么?
Why?

826
01:30:31,128 --> 01:30:34,491
那时就是原始有机生命的终结
The end of primitive organic life.

827
01:30:34,685 --> 01:30:38,241
一个更具智能生命时代的序幕
And the dawn of a more advanced age.

828
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:42,956
所有存在的生物都服务于其中心电脑
Everything would exist just to serve its intelligence.

829
01:30:43,157 --> 01:30:45,202
不 威尔不会这么做的
No. Will wouldn't do that. 

830
01:30:45,355 --> 01:30:49,116
威尔当然不会这么做
No. He wouldn't.

831
01:30:50,149 --> 01:30:53,115
威尔什么时候想过改变这个世界?
When did Will ever wanna change the world?

832
01:30:56,064 --> 01:30:59,347
你才是曾经想要改变世界的那个人
You were the one who wanted to change the world.

833
01:31:01,779 --> 01:31:03,505
上传他的思维...
That thing...

834
01:31:05,334 --> 01:31:07,174
不是威尔做的
It's not Will.

835
01:31:08,252 --> 01:31:09,933
不能怪他
Never was.

836
01:31:15,645 --> 01:31:17,531
你永远不会相信
You never believed.

837
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:24,079
你从不相信他不只是些大脑思维
You never believed that there was anything more.

838
01:31:26,034 --> 01:31:29,397
他还有灵魂
Any part of his soul.

839
01:31:31,189 --> 01:31:36,632
我这一生都致力于将大脑简化为一系列电脉冲
I spent my life trying to reduce the brain to a series of electrical impulses.

840
01:31:37,303 --> 01:31:38,984
我失败了
I failed.

841
01:31:42,018 --> 01:31:43,904
人类的感情...
Human emotion...

842
01:31:45,255 --> 01:31:48,414
能包容很多不合逻辑的冲突
It can contain illogical conflict.

843
01:31:50,650 --> 01:31:52,490
可以爱着一个人...
Can love someone...

844
01:31:53,727 --> 01:31:56,249
同时又恨着他的所作所为
and yet hate the things that they've done.

845
01:31:59,841 --> 01:32:01,886
机器没办法调解这种矛盾
Machine can't reconcile that.

846
01:32:04,557 --> 01:32:07,443
- 你可以吗?  - 可以
- Can you?  - Yes.

847
01:32:19,861 --> 01:32:21,667
病毒有用吗?
Does the virus work?

848
01:32:25,096 --> 01:32:28,573
只要开始执行 病毒就能清除掉所有由机器编码的东西
Once it executes, it'll wipe out anything with the machine's code on it.

849
01:32:28,732 --> 01:32:32,095
你知道这会影响到联网的每台计算机
You do realize this affects every computer connected to the Internet.

850
01:32:32,249 --> 01:32:36,612
所以所有的输电网 银行 和储备市场
So the power grids, the banks, the stock markets.

851
01:32:36,765 --> 01:32:38,844
所有一切都会失效
Everything goes dark.

852
01:32:43,518 --> 01:32:46,120
欢迎 真高兴你来了
Welcome. Glad you're here.

853
01:32:49,872 --> 01:32:52,678
真正的问题是我们要怎么翻过机器的防火墙
The real problem is how we get past the machine's defenses.

854
01:32:52,829 --> 01:32:54,669
为什么我们不除掉那片太阳能板呢?
Why don't we take out the solar field?

855
01:32:54,827 --> 01:32:58,508
耗光他的电力 尽可能减慢它的运行速度
Deprive it of its power and possibly slow it down.

856
01:32:58,663 --> 01:33:01,946
我不知道 我不知道它是怎么运作的
I don't know. I don't see how that's gonna work.

857
01:33:02,579 --> 01:33:05,976
他想将我上传到他的... 它的意识流
He wants to upload me to him... Its consciousness.

858
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:07,584
绝对不行
Absolutely not.

859
01:33:07,734 --> 01:33:10,176
我们将病毒输入我的系统...
We inject the infected virus into my system...

860
01:33:10,372 --> 01:33:12,609
然后我回去让他上传我
and then I go back and let him upload me.

861
01:33:12,770 --> 01:33:15,372
这是在他发现之前的唯一机会
There's a chance it won't detect it until it's too late.

862
01:33:15,526 --> 01:33:20,003
只要纳米颗粒进入到她的血管系统 就会开始改造她的细胞
As soon as the nanites enter her bloodstream, they'll start to alter her cells.

863
01:33:20,162 --> 01:33:22,287
所以当病毒摧毁机器的时候...
So when the virus takes out the machine...

864
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:24,087
也会杀了她
it could kill her too.

865
01:33:24,238 --> 01:33:25,600
我知道
I know.

866
01:33:27,515 --> 01:33:29,957
我是唯一一个他相信的人
I'm the only one he trusts.

867
01:33:52,050 --> 01:33:54,209
加把劲
Hustle up.

868
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:45,726
你们该进去了
You gotta go.

869
01:36:18,506 --> 01:36:19,743
那是什么?
What is that?

870
01:36:19,905 --> 01:36:21,586
是他吗?
Is that him?

871
01:36:21,743 --> 01:36:23,504
哦 我的天呐
Oh, my God.

872
01:36:23,662 --> 01:36:27,059
我不知道发生了什么 但那个不是他 不可能是他
I don't know what it's done, but it's not him. It can't be.

873
01:36:53,672 --> 01:36:55,592
我找到了回去的办法
I found a way back.

874
01:37:29,757 --> 01:37:33,040
- 他们准备袭击我们  - 我知道 你得离开
- They're going to attack us.  - I know. You need to leave.

875
01:37:33,192 --> 01:37:34,759
不 我还不会再一次离开你
No. I'm not leaving you again.

876
01:37:34,911 --> 01:37:36,512
这里不安全 依芙琳
It's not safe here, Evelyn.

877
01:37:42,943 --> 01:37:45,510
你可以保护我
You can protect me.

878
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:48,306
只要你上传了我...
If you upload me...

879
01:37:50,695 --> 01:37:53,262
你就能保护我
you can protect me.

880
01:37:57,129 --> 01:37:59,094
你的心在悸动
Your heart is palpitating.

881
01:38:00,286 --> 01:38:02,126
你在出汗
You're perspiring.

882
01:38:04,762 --> 01:38:06,249
你对我感到恐惧
You're terrified of me.

883
01:38:10,116 --> 01:38:13,275
不 我害怕我们失去这个机会
No, I'm afraid that we'll lose this chance.

884
01:38:16,710 --> 01:38:19,676
这不管用的 他不会上传她的
This isn't working. He's not letting her inside.

885
01:38:19,827 --> 01:38:22,394
那是因为那台机器不是真的爱她
It's because the machine doesn't actually love her.

886
01:38:22,544 --> 01:38:23,827
我们准备行动
We're ready to move.

887
01:38:23,982 --> 01:38:26,584
等一等 你不能这么做 她还在那儿呢
Wait a second. You can't do that. She's still out there.

888
01:38:26,740 --> 01:38:29,819
她所处的情况越危险 他就越有可能上传她
The more danger she's in, the more chance he'll upload her.

889
01:38:29,977 --> 01:38:32,102
约瑟夫
Joseph.

890
01:38:32,255 --> 01:38:33,413
她同意这么做
She agreed to this.

891
01:38:33,574 --> 01:38:36,574
不是这么做 他同意的不是这个 计划不是这样的 给她一个机会
Not to this, she didn't. This was not the plan. Give her a chance.

892
01:38:38,408 --> 01:38:39,850
很抱歉 马克斯
I'm sorry, Max.

893
01:38:46,201 --> 01:38:47,280
开火
Fire.

894
01:38:52,275 --> 01:38:54,320
威尔 上传我吧
Will, please upload me.

895
01:38:55,232 --> 01:38:58,674
你为什么失去了信仰 依芙琳? 你为什么不相信我?
Why did you lose faith, Evelyn? Why didn't you believe in me?

896
01:39:02,745 --> 01:39:03,790
开火
Fire.

897
01:39:08,499 --> 01:39:10,021
威尔!
Will!

898
01:39:15,052 --> 01:39:16,778
开火
Fire.

899
01:39:17,130 --> 01:39:18,175
威尔!
Will!

900
01:39:21,446 --> 01:39:23,093
她被击中了
She's hit.

901
01:39:43,184 --> 01:39:44,263
开火
Fire.

902
01:40:04,004 --> 01:40:05,605
嘿.
Hey.

903
01:40:10,878 --> 01:40:13,400
她受伤很严重了 他带着她到地下了
She's been hit bad. He's taken her underground.

904
01:41:31,598 --> 01:41:34,325
人们恐惧不能理解的东西
People fear what they don't understand.

905
01:41:36,992 --> 01:41:38,912
你想毁灭我吗?
You want to destroy me?

906
01:41:41,828 --> 01:41:44,555
不 威尔 拜托了
No, Will, please.

907
01:41:46,783 --> 01:41:49,146
你是在毁灭他们
You're destroying them.

908
01:41:53,496 --> 01:41:54,575
不
No.

909
01:41:55,454 --> 01:41:57,691
我在拯救他们
I'm trying to save them.

910
01:42:26,384 --> 01:42:27,542
快跑
Run.

911
01:42:37,334 --> 01:42:38,571
约瑟夫 没关系
Joseph, it's okay.

912
01:42:39,172 --> 01:42:41,251
没人会受伤的
Nobody's gonna get hurt.

913
01:42:44,406 --> 01:42:45,848
威尔?
Will?

914
01:42:49,801 --> 01:42:51,721
别动!
Stop!

915
01:42:58,392 --> 01:43:00,118
现在上传病毒
Upload the virus now.

916
01:43:00,310 --> 01:43:03,150
他不会在意你会不会杀了我 他不会 也不能
He doesn't care if you kill me. He can't. He's not able to.

917
01:43:03,348 --> 01:43:04,949
上传病毒
Upload the virus.

918
01:43:07,264 --> 01:43:09,229
她在做什么?
What is she doing?

919
01:43:10,022 --> 01:43:12,259
她威胁说要杀了他
She's threatening to kill him.

920
01:43:13,818 --> 01:43:18,739
人们恐惧不了解的东西
People fear what they don't understand.

921
01:43:20,531 --> 01:43:22,053
我可以治愈她的身体 马克斯
I can heal her body, Max.

922
01:43:22,209 --> 01:43:25,526
或者我可以上传病毒 但是没时间两件事情都做
Or I can upload the virus, but there's not enough time for both.

923
01:43:26,126 --> 01:43:27,454
电量不够了
There's not enough power.

924
01:43:28,124 --> 01:43:30,203
不 威尔 不要
No, Will, please.

925
01:43:31,959 --> 01:43:34,765
拜托 听我说 威尔
Please, listen to me, Will.

926
01:43:41,431 --> 01:43:44,714
他不能因为我们犯下的错而死去
He can't die because of what we've done.

927
01:44:48,045 --> 01:44:50,170
我可以看到一切
I can see everything.

928
01:45:02,551 --> 01:45:03,709
看到天空
Look at the sky.

929
01:45:06,427 --> 01:45:08,153
云朵
The clouds.

930
01:45:10,103 --> 01:45:13,705
我们可以修复生态系统 而不是破坏它
We're healing the ecosystem, not harming it.

931
01:45:17,136 --> 01:45:19,612
那些粒子参与空气循环...
Particles join the air currents...

932
01:45:19,774 --> 01:45:22,455
隔绝污染 自我重建
building themselves out of pollutants.

933
01:45:24,888 --> 01:45:28,330
森林可以重生
Forests can be regrown.

934
01:45:30,922 --> 01:45:36,207
水质如此纯净 你可以喝任何一条河里的水
Water so pure you can drink out of any river.

935
01:45:39,594 --> 01:45:41,877
这是你的梦
This is your dream.

936
01:45:43,070 --> 01:45:46,547
不仅仅是治愈疾病 而是治愈整个地球
Not merely to cure disease, but to heal the planet.

937
01:45:46,747 --> 01:45:49,986
并且为我们所有人创建一个更好的未来
And build a better future for all of us.

938
01:46:09,165 --> 01:46:10,687
就是这个
That's it.

939
01:46:11,243 --> 01:46:12,969
病毒
The virus.

940
01:46:18,995 --> 01:46:20,517
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

941
01:46:21,153 --> 01:46:22,198
还好
Yeah.

942
01:46:37,617 --> 01:46:39,696
他没有杀任何一个人
He didn't kill anyone.

943
01:46:59,276 --> 01:47:00,684
威尔...
Will...

944
01:47:03,511 --> 01:47:05,272
这才是你
It is you.

945
01:47:08,147 --> 01:47:10,033
我从来没有改变
Always was.

946
01:47:13,862 --> 01:47:16,464
很抱歉我没有相信你
I'm sorry I didn't believe.

947
01:47:29,007 --> 01:47:30,688
想想那个花园
Think about the garden.

948
01:47:33,123 --> 01:47:35,850
想想我们的避难所
Think about our sanctuary.

949
01:47:44,991 --> 01:47:47,388
我永远不会丢下你
I'll never let you go.

950
01:49:22,295 --> 01:49:25,056
那病毒消灭了一切
The virus took out everything.

951
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:41,083
正如他们所说的 一场全世界的暂停
A worldwide blackout, just as they'd said.

952
01:49:46,231 --> 01:49:49,197
但我知道还有些东西
But I knew there was something more.

953
01:49:51,626 --> 01:49:53,352
一直存在
There had to be.

954
01:50:05,053 --> 01:50:08,939
他建这个花园的原因 和他做的所有事原因一样
He created this garden for the same reason he did everything.

955
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,363
所以他们可以永远在一起了
So that they could be together.
