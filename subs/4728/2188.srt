好的  我意思是  我能和她谈谈吗
Okay. I mean, so can I go talk to her?

124
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:14,344
艾默霍先生  对不起  但是你妻子已经死了
Mr. Emhoff, I'm sorry. Your wife is dead.

125
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,419
我刚还看着她  刚在家里还是好好的
I mean, I just saw her. We were just at home.

126
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,391
你还有其他可以联系到的亲人吗
Is there somebody that we can call?

127
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,327
你觉得应该在这儿陪伴你的人?
Someone who you think should be here with you?

128
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:36,537
我们一起吃的晚饭  一起吃披萨  她说她只是有点时差反应
I mean, we had dinner. We had pizza. She said she was jet-lagged.

129
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:39,109
你提到过她去过很远的地方  是香港吗?
You mentioned that she was away. Hong Kong?

130
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,346
我们看过最新的报告
We checked the latest bulletins.

131
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,948
那儿有麻疹和H1N1病毒病史
The only things there were measles and H1N1...

132
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:46,346
但你妻子得的不是这两种病
...and this was not that.

133
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,214
那是什么病?
Then what was it?

134
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:49,684
我们也不确定
We don't always know.

135
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:53,882
我是说  有些人得了病活得好好的  
而有些人变得虚弱最后死去
I mean, some people get a disease 
and live  some get sicker and die.

136
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,324
我们得通知法医…
We're gonna have to notify 
the medical examiner...

137
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,395
…他们也许会请求做尸检
...and they may request an autopsy.

138
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:01,032
或者你希望的话  我们可以安排下
Or if you wish, we can order one.

139
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,499
但是我不保证这会让你得到更多有用的信息
But I can't guarantee it's gonna tell you any more than I can.

140
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,504
我最好的猜测是这既不是脑膜炎  也不是脑炎
I mean, my best guess is that this was either 
meningitis or encephalitis...

141
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:11,734
对于脑炎  我们现在知之甚少
...and with encephalitis, we're in 
the dark a lot of the time.

142
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:16,109
如果这是发生在夏天  我可能会认为是臭虫咬的  
比如西尼罗河病毒
If it was summer, I might say a bug bite
you know, West Nile.

143
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,546
- 我不知道 - 疱疹可引起脑炎
- I don't know...  - Herpes can cause encephalitis.

144
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:21,152
她没有疱疹
She didn't have herpes.

145
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,912
- 你在说些什么东西  - 别激动
- What are you talking about? - Okay.

146
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,920
她到底怎么了?
What happened to her?

147
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,086
- 她到底怎么了  - 冷静点  冷静点
- What happened to her? - Okay, okay.

148
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,491
艾默霍先生  那边有悲痛辅导人员
Mr. Emhoff, there are grief counselors...

149
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:35,327
…他们对开导这种失去亲人的悲痛的家属很有帮助
...who are very helpful with this sort of passing, okay?

150
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:38,334
你可以向他们寻求一些帮助
You might find some resolution there.

151
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,836
现在  我只能说很抱歉
Now, I am sorry.

152
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:02,193
喂?
Hello?

153
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:08,792
挂掉电话  赶紧拨911  马上拨打911报警
Hang up the phone and call 911 right now. Right now. 911.

154
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:12,168
他说他头痛  所以我让他睡一下
He said he had a headache, so I put him to bed.

155
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,465
我觉得他没有呼吸了
I don't think he's breathing.

156
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:21,709
克拉克  克拉克
Clark. Clark.

157
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,746
噢  天哪  他死了吗
Oh, my God, is he dead?

158
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,809

164

中国广东省  人口: 九千六百一十万

165
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:39,655
我们如何定义"遏制"的?
How are we defining "contained?"

166
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,821
他们使用的是特地为非典建立的应急方案
They're using the same protocols established for SARS.

167
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:45,759
他们在隔离人群并进行症状病人筛选
They're quarantining the complex and screening for symptoms.

168
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,593
九龙是世界上最稠密的人口居住区
Kowloon is the most densely populated area in the world...

169
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,633
…香港的地形是个港湾

170
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:51,929
疫情会迅速扩散
It's going to spread.

171

香港正给我们寄来血液样本

我们也在调查来自伦敦的样本

173
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,410
一个死在旅馆里  另外一个死在健身俱乐部
One at a hotel, the other at a health club.

174
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,549

175

还有一个死于东京公交车上的男子

尼尔先生  你要坚持住
Mr. Neal, I want you to stay with me here.

179
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,694
能听到我说话吗  你以前有过癫痫发作吗 尼尔先生?
Can you hear me? Have you had seizures before? Mr. Neal?

180
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:28,863
- 如果可以请睁开你的眼睛  - 他还有呼吸吧?
- I want you to open your eyes if you can.  - He's breathing, right?

181
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:32,442
我叫不醒他  我回到家就发现他这样了  我叫不醒他
I couldn't wake him. I got home, I couldn't wake him.

182
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,909
今天早上起来我们俩感觉很虚弱

小心撞到头
Watch your head.

184
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,324

大脑皱沟已经被损坏了  检查下其他地方
Well, the sulci are obliterated. Let's look at the base.

186
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,277
噢  天哪
Oh, my God.

187
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:12,046
要取个样本吗?  还是?

188
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,743
我想让你离手术桌远点儿

200
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,386
新闻一定会铺天盖地
It's gonna be all over the news.

你觉得当务之急是什么?
What's your single overriding communications objective?

We're isolating the sick and quarantining 
those who we believe were exposed.

203
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:05,827

If you need resources, call me. 
If you get into a political dogfight, call me.

If you find yourself wide awake, staring at the walls at 3 a. M...

209
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:24,380
我们前往调查的地方可是易感风寒之地
We're looking at around zero with the wind chill.

210
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,586

你爸爸被隔离了

They're, you know, just making sure.

221
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:32,249
但你和他们在一起  你可能会感染的
But you were with them. You could still get it.

222

No, I won't. Um, they said this happens really, really fast.

And, uh, I'm fine. There's nothing wrong with me.

If something had happened to you, I mean, I'd...

236
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,470

It's a weekend. These numbers might be low.

People are staying home for a couple days, see if they get better.

245
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,907
根据这点判断  我认为是呼吸感染
At this point, I think we have to believe this is respiratory.

246
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,807
- 也可能是受感染的衣服和被褥等  - 什么意思?
- Maybe fomites too. - What's that, fomites?

247
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:04,210
呃  是指病毒通过表面介质传播  
Uh, it refers to transmission from surfaces.

248
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:07,784
平均每人每天触摸他们自己的体表2-3000次
The average person touches their face 2- or 3000 times a day.

249
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:13,220
- 2-3000次每天?  
- 醒着的每一分钟平均触摸3-5次
- Two- or 3000 times a day? 
- Three to five times every waking minute.

250
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:16,327
期间  我们会接触门把手…
In between, we're touching doorknobs...

251
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:19,225
…饮水机  电梯按钮  还有其他东西等
 ...water fountains, elevator buttons and each other.

252
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,798
这些东西会变成污染物源
Those things become fomites.

253
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:25,334
这是我们要公布的东西?  呼吸系统疾病和污染物?
Is this something we wanna release to the press? Respiratory and fomites?

254
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:29,201
- 公众会作何反应?  
- 很难说  一部电影里的塑料鲨鱼…
- How's the public gonna react?  
- Hard to say. A plastic shark in a movie...

255
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:32,866
…会让人害怕到远离海洋  但是关于香烟的警告
...will keep people from getting in the ocean, 
but a warning on cigarettes...

256
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:36,503
在大家惊慌失措前我们必须通知政府相关人员
We need to walk the governor through this before we freak everybody out.

257
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:40,914
我是指  我们现在甚至不能告诉公众
他们应该害怕的东西是什么
I mean, heh, we can't even tell people right 
now what they should be afraid of.

258
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:44,180
以前猪流感爆发时我们试过这样做 
结果使得健康的人们非常惧怕
We tried that with swine flu. 
All we did was get healthy people scared.

259
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:46,153
这是今年最大的购物周末
It's the biggest shopping weekend of the year.

260
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,122
我们需要考虑关闭学校

261
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,524
谁留在家里陪孩子?  他们都在商店上班
And who stays home with the kids? People that work at stores.

262
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,961
政府工作者  在医院工作的人们
Government workers. People that work at hospitals.

263
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,660
什么时候我们才知道这是什么病毒? 
是什么引起的? 什么药物可以治愈?
When will we know what this is?
 What causes it, what cures it?

264
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:00,134
这些可以让公众保持镇定
Things that keep people calm.

265
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:04,969
我们需要决定的是:
What we need to determine is this:

266
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,874
因为这些已经感染病毒的人…
For every person who gets sick...

267
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:11,641
…其他正常的人有多少可能会被感染
...how many other people are they likely to infect?

268
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:15,481
对季节性流感来说  一般为1
So for seasonal flu, that's usually about one.

269
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:19,215
如果是天花   这个数字大于3
Smallpox, on the other hand,it's over three.

270
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:20,858
现在  还没有疫苗之前…
Now, before we had a vaccine...

271
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:25,360
脊髓灰质炎的传播速率在4-6之间
...polio spread at a rate between four and six.

272
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,557
现在  我们称这些数字为…
Now, we call that number...

273
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,962
R0平均数
(即R0 表示某个传染病患者将疾病传染给其他人的平均数)
(如果小于1 传染病就会自己消亡 如果大于1 病毒会传播开来)
the R-nought.

274
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:35,971
R代表该病毒的繁殖率
R stands for the reproductive rate of the virus.

275
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:38,405
能知道这种病毒的传输速率吗?
Any ideas what that might be for this?

276
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:42,741
传播速度取决于多种因素
How fast it multiplies depends on a variety of factors.

277
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,782
病毒的潜伏期  一个人会感染的时期长短
The incubation period, how long a person is contagious.

278
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:49,182
有时候即使人们没有症状也会有传染性
Sometimes people can be contagious 
without even having symptoms.

279
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,015
我们必须清楚这个
We need to know that too.

280
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,354
我们需要知道容易感染该病毒的人群的基数有多大
We need to know how big the population of 
people susceptible to the virus might be.

281
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,587
这样说来所有有手、嘴和鼻子的人都有可能了
So far that appears to be everyone with hands, a mouth and a nose.

282
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:02,757
只要我们知道了R0的平均数值  
我们就可以着手处理大规模的疫情
Once we know the R-nought, 
we'll be able to get a handle on the scale of the epidemic.

283
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:05,768
这么说这是种流行病  什么流行病?
So it's an epidemic now. An epidemic of what?

284
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,735
我们已经给疾控中心寄去了样本
We sent samples to the CDC.

285
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,268
如果幸运的话  72小时之内就可以知道是什么病毒了
In 72 hours, we'll know what it is, if we're lucky.

286
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:15,310
很明显  我们不太走运
Clearly, we're not lucky.

287

- Mine was great, thanks. - Oh.

295
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,679
病毒呈现多形性 但主要倾向于卵形
It's pleomorphic, but tends toward ovoid in shape.

296
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,785
表面结构看起来很像糖蛋白
I see structures on the surface 
that look like glycoproteins...

297
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,387
但是没有病毒特有的形态
...but there's nothing morphologically pathognomonic.

298
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:33,547
我们测试了她身上所有的抗体    
交叉反应不多
We tested all her antibodies. 
I didn't see much cross-reactivity.

299
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:37,092
她的身体完全没有抵抗能力  情况不断恶化
Her body had no idea what to do with it. It just kept amplifying.

300
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:39,127
把这个发给旧金山的萨斯曼
Send it to Sussman in San Francisco.

301
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,391
如果他也查不出这是什么病毒的话  没人会知道了
If he doesn't know what it is, nobody does.

302
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:46,162
这种病毒显示了新奇的特性  
跟原生细胞嵌合在一起
It shows novel characteristics 
and appears to be chimeric in origin.

303
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:52,299
病毒有15至19个碱基长度  拥有6-10个基因
Virus is 15 to 19 kilobases in length and 
containing six to 10 genes.

不  我是个作家  没错
Yes, I am a writer. Yes, I am.

310
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:13,190
写个博客可算不上作家  
只不过是标点符号的拼凑罢了
Blogging is not writing. 
It's graffiti with punctuation.

311
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:17,062
我是个记者  我的博客有知情讨论相关的板块
I am a journalist, and there's informed

大概10天
About 10 days.

363
00:24:56,895 --> 00:25:01,855
没关系  潜伏期低于这个时间段
That's okay. The incubation period is less than that.

364
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:04,729
还有其他人可能和她接触过吗?

366
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:09,600
巴恩斯?  他在另一层楼工作
Barnes? He worked on another floor.

367
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:12,709
巴恩斯有她需要的文档  他去机场接的她
There were documents she needed.
He picked her up from the airport.

368
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,741
巴恩斯去机场接的她?  巴恩斯现在在哪?
He picked her up from the airport? Where is he?

369
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:17,939
喂?
Hello?

370
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:20,983
- 你好  巴恩斯先生吗?  - 你好  我是
- Hello? Mr. Barnes? - Hello? Yes.

371
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,588
我是疾控中心的米尔丝医生
This is Dr. Mears from the Centers for Disease Control.

372
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:25,780
- 我认为…  - 嗨
- I believe...  - Hi.

373
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:29,984
嗨  我相信你上个星期和贝丝・艾默霍接触过
Hi. I believe you may have had contact
with Beth Emhoff last week.

374
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:32,527
是的  我去机场接她  怎么了?
Yeah, I picked her up at the airport. 
What's this about?

375
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:36,959
- 你今天感觉如何?  - 呃  老实说  很难受
- And how are you feeling today?
- Uh, pretty cruddy, to be honest.

376
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:39,467
我头很痛  可能是被什么小虫子咬了
My head is pounding.
I probably picked up some bug.

377
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:42,869
- 你现在什么地方?  - 去上班的公交车上
- Where are you right now? - I'm on the bus, heading to work.

378
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,066
- 我建议你立即下车  - 什么?
- I'd like you to get off immediately. - What?

379
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:46,904
- 他在公交车上  - 哪个位置?
- He's on a bus. - Where?

380
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:51,014
- 哪儿  公交车在哪个地方  亚伦?  - 嗯… 呃…  
-Where? Where's the bus, Aaron?  - Em... Uh...

381
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:53,673
- 现在刚到Lake and Lyndale. 怎么了?  
- 他在Lake and Lyndale.
- Lake and Lyndale. What's going on?
- Lake and Lyndale.

382
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:55,649
我需要你立即下车
I really need you to get off that bus.

383
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,880
很有可能你已经感染了传染性疾病
It's possible you've come in contact with an infectious disease...

384
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,491
并且有高度的传染性  明白了吗?
...and you're highly contagious. Do you understand?

385
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,561
我要你马上下车  远离人群  避免和人接触
I want you to get off now.
And stay away from other people.

386
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:05,753
现在我该怎么做?
Now what do I do?

387
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:08,331
不要触碰任何人  不要与任何人说话
Don't talk to anyone, don't touch anyone.

388
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,400
这是最重要的事情
That's the most important thing.

389
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,561
- 我们会派人去接公交车  - 好的
- We'll send somebody to meet the bus. - Okay.

390
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,206
我现在过去接你  亚伦
I'm on my way to you now, Aaron.

391
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:23,611
我孩子怎么办?  我接触过他们了
What about my kids? I touched them.

392
00:26:56,848 --> 00:27:00,807
那是一个新工厂的奠基仪式
It was a groundbreaking ceremony for a new factory.

393
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:03,887
她因为工作需要经常出差
She traveled a lot for work.

394
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:06,615
她的工作会涉及到以任何方式与牲畜接触吗?
Did her work involve contact with livestock in any way?

395
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,555
- 你家里养了什么宠物吗  - 没有
- Did you keep any pets at home? - No.

396
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,228
没有养
No.

397
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:16,332
她有提过说和带病的人见过面吗?
Did she mention seeing anyone who was sick?

398
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:19,166
在飞机上?
Anyone on a plane?

399
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:21,805
没有
No.

400
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:27,209
她早上11:15经过芝加哥的海关…
She went through customs in Chicago at 11:15 a. M...

401
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:31,406
然后乘飞机在下午6点到达明尼阿波利斯
...and then took a flight to Minneapolis at 6 p.m.

402
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:34,279
知道她在芝加哥临时滞留期间都做过什么吗?
Any idea what she did in Chicago during that layover?

403
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:35,476
比如开会?
Did she have meetings?

404
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:40,751
有什么事情让她必须离开机场?
Is there any reason she might have left the airport?

405
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:47,364
为什么这么问?  难道芝加哥有人感染了这种病吗?
Why? I mean, is there someone sick in Chicago?

406
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:57,639
呃  在我们结婚之前  我妻子和一个
Uh, before we were married, my wife had a relationship...

407
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:00,744
叫做乔恩・尼尔的人有过一段感情
...with a man in Chicago named Jon Neal.

408
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,843
乔恩・尼尔感染了?
Is Jon Neal sick?

409
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,112
我们是因为他而传染的?
Did we get this from him?

410
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:15,620
- 我们在调查所有的可能性
- 不  我觉得我有权利知道事情真相
- We're investigating all the possibilities.
- No. I think I have a right to know.

411
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:18,456
看看我现在呆的这个地方
看看我现在呆的这个地方
Look at where I am here.
Look at where I am here.

412
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:22,964
- 我不能透露信息  抱歉
- 不是  我只是想弄明白
- I can't disclose that information. I'm sorry.
- No, I'm just... I'm just trying to understand.

413
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:24,226
我理解
I know.

414
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:26,393
从萨斯曼那儿得到的结果一样
We're getting the same results as Sussman.

415
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:28,903
我们已经给病毒测序  确定病毒源
 We've sequenced the virus, determined its origin...

416
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:32,532
我们制作了病毒侵入肺和脑细胞的过程模型
...and we've modeled the way
it enters the cells of the lung and the brain.

417
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,941
这种病毒含有蝙蝠和猪的基因序列
The virus contains both bat and pig sequences.

418
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:37,911
深绿的部分代表猪  浅绿色代表蝙蝠
The dark green is pig, and the light green is bat.

419
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,108
这里你可以看到交叉事件的发生过程
And here you can see the crossover event.

420
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:43,777
呃  蝙蝠  蝙蝠  然后是猪  蝙蝠
Uh, bat, bat, and pig, bat.

421
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:47,755
这个模型阐述了病毒是如何寄宿在宿主身上
And here is a model of the virus and how it attaches to its host.

422
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:52,920
蓝色的部分是病毒  金色的是人类基因
红色部分是病毒附着蛋白
The blue is virus, and the gold is human,
and the red is the viral attachment protein...

423
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:55,692
绿色代表人体细胞内的受体部分
...and the green is its receptor in the human cells.

424
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:59,769
这些受体在呼吸道以及…
These receptors are found in the cells of both the respiratory tract...

425
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,530
…中枢神经系统的细胞内都有发现
...and the central nervous system.

426
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:07,508
这些病毒就像钥匙插进锁里一般附着在细胞上
And the virus attaches to the cell like a key slipping into a lock.

427
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,978
世界上的某个角落  一头倒霉的猪遇到了带病的蝙蝠
Somewhere in the world, the wrong pig met up with the wrong bat.

428
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:15,552
- 你见过这种病毒吗
- 没有  而且这种病毒一直在变化着
- You ever seen anything like this before?
- No. And it's still changing.

429
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,245
病毒识别我们人类细胞的速度比人类基因识别病毒快多了
It's figuring us out faster than we're figuring it out.

430
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,653
病毒就只干这个了
It doesn't have anything else to do.

431
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:23,794
这么说我们遇到的一种新型病毒
So we have a novel virus with a mortality rate in the low 20s...

432
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:26,692
而目前没有治疗方法  也没有疫苗
...no treatment protocol, and no vaccine at this time.

433
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,560
完全正确
That is correct.

434
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:35,329
从现在开始  就让BSL-4全力负责研究这个
(BSL 生物安全实验室 BSL4为最高等级)
From here on out, I want no one working on this except at BSL-4.

435
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:40,103
我们还需要做的是停止其他实验室继续研究这个病毒
Last thing we need is for this to walk out of
the lab on the bottom of someone's shoe.

436
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:54,348
这里是萨斯曼医生办公室
Dr. Sussman's office.

437
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:56,721
是我  Ally Hextall
Lan, hi. Ally Hextall.

438
00:29:56,895 --> 00:30:00,353
我们需要关掉你的实验室  这件事情太棘手了  呃…
We need to shut you down. This thing's too hot. Uh...

439
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:04,525
- 现在只授权给BSL-4级实验室来负责
- 这是个错误的决定
- BSL-4 only at this point.
- I think that's a mistake.

440
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:08,565
销毁你那儿的样本  呃  销毁一切相关的东西
Cook your samples. Uh, destroy everything.

441
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,907
- 我们不能冒险  - 我们正有所进展
- We can't risk it.  - We're making progress.

442
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:15,910
把这个交给政府管理的BSL-4级实验室来做太不明智了
You limit this to government-run BSL-4s, it'll take forever.

443
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,604
我可以办到的
I can do this.

444
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,010
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

445
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:24,177
随便你
Yeah.

446
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:25,879
当然了 艾丽.
Sure, Ally.

447
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,324
你能重复下目前为止受感染的城市吗
Can you repeat the affected cities so far?

448
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,126
再说一次  受到感染的城市有…
Again, the affected cities are...

449
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:41,295
明尼阿波利斯  芝加哥  洛杉矶  波士顿和盐湖城
Minneapolis, Chicago, Los Angeles, Boston and Salt Lake.

450
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:44,202
我们期望这个名单增长的速度…
We expect that list to grow...

451
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:46,673
… 人们都度假结束返家了
...as people return home from their holidays.

452
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,107
什么事?
Yes?

453
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,747
米切尔医生  有多少人已经感染了病毒?
Dr. Cheever, how many people are infected...

454
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:52,109
…死亡人数是多少?
...and how many have died?

455
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:54,945
这些数字在我们讲话的同时不断变化着
Those numbers are changing as we speak...

456
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,587
所以我给你的数字很可能要低些
...so any figure I give you is likely to be low.

457
00:30:57,755 --> 00:31:00,315
我们在精确计算这个时间段的死亡率
We're still calculating the mortality rate at this time.

458
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:03,120
呃  米切尔医生  你是否注意到
Uh, Dr. Cheever, are you concerned...

459
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:05,592
现在疾控中心面临着一个诚信的问题
..that the CDC faces a credibility issue here...

460
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:08,630
…自从对H1N1的过度反应后?
...after the perceived overreaction to H1 N1?

461
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,961
我倒是希望事情发展证明我们真的反应过度了
I'd rather the story be that we overreacted...

462
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:14,366
总比因为我们做的不够导致许多人失去了生命好吧
than that many people lost their lives because we didn't do enough.

463
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,733
这是我们站在这里的原因
That's why we're here.

464
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:21,004
这也是为什么世界卫生组织要派
一名流行病学家前往香港调查
It's also why the World Health Organization
is sending an epidemiologist to Hong Kong.

465
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,579
不调查病毒的源头很难去深入调查病毒
Hard to know what it is without where it came from.

466
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:26,876
我们的首要工作就是找到病毒源头
Our first job with these things is to find ground zero.

467
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,485
查出它是如何流入人群开始传播的
Figure out how it jumped into the population.

468
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:32,885
我们知道一个在明尼苏达州的患者
...We do know that a patient in Minnesota...

469
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,025
曾经去过全球很多地方旅行
traveled to that part of the world.

470
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:40,395
香港  人口: 七百一十万

471
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:49,563
我们相信目前大约有89,000个疑似病例
We believe that there are approximately
 89,000 cases at this point...

472
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:54,162
我们将面对的是可能有267,000人会感染
...and that we are heading toward 267,000.

473
00:32:54,939 --> 00:33:00,309
从那儿开始  利用我们建好的模型 基于R0平均数为2…
And from there, using our model, based on an R-nought of two...

474
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:03,606
这些是未来48小时会扩散到的地区
...here is where we expect to be in 48 hours.

475
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:07,217
米切尔医生  也许你有什么进一步的消息
Dr. Cheever, perhaps you can update us on the research.

476
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:11,482
目前为止  没人找到一个成功的
培育病毒在细胞内的成长的方法来
As of right now, no one has found
a good way to grow the virus in cells.

477
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,283
为什么
Why is that?

478
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:17,519
因为病毒杀死了我们放进去的所有细胞
不管是猪的细胞  或者鸡的  所有生物细胞都一样
Because it kills every cell we put it in.
A pig, a chicken, everything.

479
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:21,256
除非能培育这种病毒  而且是大量的  
不然没法做实验
Until we can grow it, and a great deal of it,
we can't experiment with it.

480
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,559
在这之前  我们不能接种疫苗
And until then, we can't vaccinate against it.

481
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:29,139
你们找到任何的治疗方法了没? 
任何有用的抗体?  有吗?
Have you found any treatment at all?
Any antivirus? Anything?

482
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,164
没有
No.

483
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:36,610
贝丝・艾默霍在澳门赌场使用过一个自动取款机
Beth Emhoff used an ATM at a casino in Macao.

484
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:38,749
花旗银行给出了她的账单记录
Citibank released her records.

485
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:44,513
她在10:43的时候使用过这台ATM  
当时刚从赌场出来
We have her using the machine at 10:43
just off the casino floor.

486
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:49,353
我需要查看赌场这2个小时内的监控录像
I wanna see the casino security footage
for two hours on either side of that.

487
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:52,486
有什么问题吗
Is there a problem?

488
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:56,155
哦  他们是我老家的村民  
他们那儿发现了新的感染人群
Oh, they're from my village.
They found a new cluster there.

489
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:57,693
抱歉
Oh.

490
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:02,169
- 你家里人还在那儿吗
- 我的母亲出现了症状
- Is your family still there?
- My mother has symptoms.

491
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,571
我给你取监控录像  稍等
I'll get you the footage you require. Excuse me.

492
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:51,445
萨斯曼医生  我听说他们打算中止我们进行实验
Dr. Sussman, I heard that they were shutting us down.

493
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:53,817
是的  我正要处理这些样本
Yeah, I just have to deal with the samples.

494
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:56,482
如果只是销毁他们  我能胜任这个工作
If it's just a matter of destroying them, I can do it.

495
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:58,561
不用了  我来就行  你回家吧
No, I'll take care of it. You go on home.

496
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:01,562
我做完后会再核对下数据
I'll do that, and then I just 
want to recheck some data.

497
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,321
他培育成功了
He grew it.

498
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,933
他通过抗体和免疫膜攻击复合体 
He tried antibodies and immunological MAC outlines...

499
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:39,695
但关键是来自吉朗的蝙蝠胎儿细胞株
...but the key was a fetal-bat cell line from Geelong.

500
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:42,465
- 我们没有这个东西
- 他在3级的生物安全实验室就培育成功了
- We didn't have it.
- He grew it in a BSL-3.

501
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,404
艾丽  他在BSL-3级实验室都干什么工作?
Ally, what the hell was he doing working with it in a BSL-3?

502
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:46,838
忽视我
Ignoring me.

503
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:52,916
他一定会把这个发布的  妈的  他想要什么?
He's gonna publish. Shit. What does he want?

504
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,382
一盒雪茄  他本可以有选择的  埃利斯
A box of cigars. He had a choice, Ellis.

505
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:57,646
他完全可以自己一人靠着这个发财
He could have gone into business for himself.

506
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,723
毫无意问他已经培育病毒成功了
但是他把这个给了我们
There's no doubt he was approached,
but he gave it to us.

507
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:04,293
- 这么说我们只能相信他?
- 看来我们只能这样了
- And we're supposed to trust him?
- We don't have a choice.

508
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:09,124
美国疾病预防控制中心…
The Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention in the United States...

509
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,427
以及瑞士世界卫生组织
...and the World Health Organization in Switzerland...

510
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:14,162
今天证实  旧金山的萨斯曼医生
...confirmed today that Dr. Lan Sussman of San Francisco...

511
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:18,399
已经成功地在实验室环境中成功培育出MEV-1病毒
...has succeeded in growing the MEV-1 virus in a laboratory setting.

512
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:22,444
疾病预防控制中心的官员说现在取得的突破
Officials at the CDC cautioned that the
 breakthrough is only the first step...

513
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:24,240
只是研制疫苗的第一步
...toward developing a vaccine...

514
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:27,350
离人体试验阶段至少还有几个月
...which is likely still months away from human trials.

515
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:32,251
世界卫生组织估计
全球受感染人群超过8百万
The WHO estimates the number of people
infected worldwide to be over 8 million.

516
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:34,891
现在情况有所改变
Now it all changes.

517
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:38,261
萨斯曼成为国家科学院的受膏者
Sussman gets anointed by the National Academy of Sciences...

518
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:41,330
所有的医药行政人员都变得苛刻
...and every pharmaceutical executive  gets a hard-on.

519
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:43,831
他们会在地球上所有的实验室培育这种病毒
They'll be growing the virus in every lab on Earth.

520
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:46,561
对猕猴来说真是糟糕的一天
It's a bad day to be a rhesus monkey.

521
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:51,800
我们先是让他们进入大家的视线
现在我们要全神贯注于病毒
Crikey, first we shoot them into space,
now we'll be shooting them full of virus.

522
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,841
所以现在就是需要你专业知识的时候了
So this is where we need your expertise.

523
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:56,343
医药股票已经达到高盘了
Pharmaceutical stocks are already through the roof.

524
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:59,881
接下来是什么?  机遇在哪里?
What's next? Where's the opportunity?

525
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,611
是你首先看到日本公交车上死亡男子的视频的
Now, you saw that Shinko bus thing day one.

526
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:04,812
那才是我们会面的目的
That's why we wanted this meeting.

527
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,581
今天早上当我打开电脑时
When I turned on my computer this morning...

528
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:12,252
我的博客有超过200万访问人次来寻求真相
...I had over 2 million unique visitors, all looking for the truth.

529
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:16,525
你认为他们会愿意看到我和对冲基金的人谈判吗
You think they wanna see me talking to some hedge-fund guy?

530
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:19,898
克鲁姆维德先生  我们不是发明需求的
Mr. Krumwiede, we don't invent need here.

531
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:24,007
我们只是分析和预测
We just analyze it, predict it.

532
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:28,002
你直接告诉我  多少的报价你才愿意
You tell me what it costs to look into your crystal ball.

533
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:33,450
你真像连翘
You're familiar with forsythia?

534
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:36,579
- 不  我不是  - 我想告诉你的是…
- No, I'm not.  - What I'm about to tell you is backed up...

535
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,382
备份的证据将会短暂的出现在媒体面前
...by testimonials that will appear shortly in the media.

536
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:43,118
我会找个时机进行广泛的讨论
I'll be talking about it extensively in the days ahead.

537
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:45,888
连翘是干什么的?
What does forsythia do?

538
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:48,659
是一种药物
It's the cure.

539
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:52,360
如果我是免疫的  你不能用我的血液来治疗吗
If I'm immune, can't you use my blood to cure this?

540
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:55,869
培养血清需要很长一段时间  而且很昂贵
Blood serums can take a long time to make
 and are very expensive.

541
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,532
但好的一方面是你不会得病
But the good news here is that
 you're not going to get sick.

542
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:02,806
好的  呃…
Okay. Um...

543
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,778
你的意思是我女儿也不会染上这种病毒了  对吧?
Then that would mean that my daughter can't get it either, right?

544
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,180
我不能保证
I can't promise you that.

545
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:11,549
但她不是会继承我的一些基因吗
But isn't that something that she would inherit from me?

546
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:14,213
这个嘛  她一半的免疫系统来自于你
Well, half her immune system came from you...

547
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:17,122
但另一半免疫系统继承的是她妈妈的
...but the other half came from her mother.

548
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:25,626
快3个小时了
Almost three hours.

549
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,964
我需要医生或者护士来给我检查下
I need to see a doctor or a supervisor or something.

550
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,869
我想知道他是否也感染上了报道中说的那种病毒
I wanna know if he has this thing on the news.

551
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:34,034
很抱歉  但是我们已经在尽力了
I'm sorry, sir, we're doing the best we can.

552
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:36,736
我能和你们的负责人谈谈吗?  不管是谁都行
Can I just speak to an administrator or something? Anybody.

553
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:38,848
先生 请耐心一点  我们会让你…
Sir, please be patient. We'll get you in...

554
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:40,347
他病了
He's sick!

555
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:43,652
在车库的时候 我妻子让我脱掉了衣服
y wife makes me take off my clothes in the garage.

556
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:46,756
然后她给我准备了一桶温水和肥皂
Then she leaves out a bucket of warm water and some soap.

557
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:51,020
我离开后她把所有东西都消毒了
And then she douses everything in hand sanitizer after I leave.

558
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:53,493
我是想说  她有点反应过度  对吗
I mean, she's overreacting, right?

559
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:57,532
不尽然  还有别摸你的脸了  戴维
Not really. And stop touching your face, Dave.

560
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:06,275
好了  我们把气障病患者安置在这儿
Okay, we'll put the air lock here.

561
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:10,904
放25排  每排10张床  发烧最严重的病人安排在那边上
I want 25 rows of 10 beds apiece. The most febrile cases at this end.

562
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:15,314
联邦应急管理署会负责食物供应这块
We'll set up triage outside, FEMA can 
handle food in the basement...

563
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:19,513
我们必须在接下来的24-48小时内完成
...and we'll need to be operational 
within the next 24 to 48 hours.

564
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,157
知道了
Gotcha.

565
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:25,585
- 做得好 戴维  这个应该有效  - 谢谢
 - Nice job, Dave. This will work. - Thanks.

566
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:27,196
现在还需要3个这样的地方
Now find me three more just like it.

567
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:32,696
打扰了 米尔丝医生 这些花费是由你负责还是我们自己出?
Excuse me, Dr. Mears. Is this coming out of your budget or ours?

568
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:36,500
世界卫生组织已经证实了香港的样本
WHO has confirmed that the Hong Kong sample...

569
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:38,539
和伦敦、东京以及阿布扎比的病毒是匹配的
...matches London, Tokyo and Abu Dhabi...

570
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:42,611
我们还在检测法兰克福和开罗的感染人群
...and we're seeing large clusters in from Frankfurt and Cairo.

571
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,214
查找病毒源头携带者有什么进展没?
Are we any closer to an index patient?

572
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,944
可能是贝丝・艾默霍或者日本的死在公交车上那人
Could be your Beth Emhoff or the guy on the bus in Japan.

573
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,283
有些人上不了网   你情况怎么样?
Someone else who crawled off the grid. How you doing?

574
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:54,515
进展不错  我准备去会见…
Yeah, good. I'm going into a meeting with...

575
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:57,684
不是  我不是问你事情的进展 
我是问你的身体还好吗?
No, I didn't ask what you were doing,
I asked how you were doing.

576
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:59,056
你还好吗
How are you doing?

577
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:01,662
我  呃…
I'm, uh...

578
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,291
我很好
I'm fine.

579
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:06,231
很好?
Fine?

580
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,065
你也知道  我干这行15年了
You know, I was in the field for 15 years.

581
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:12,141
我遇到过很多糟糕的事情  如果你感觉不适  随时打电话给我
I've seen a lot of shit. If you're not doing fine, you can tell me.

582
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:15,435
你试过不得不告诉一个刚刚失去妻子和继子的男人
You ever have to tell a man who just lost his wife and stepson...

583
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:18,582
她妻子去世前还在欺骗他吗?
...that his wife was cheating on him before she died?

584
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,307
不  我没有这种经历
No, I haven't.

585
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:22,452
我相信你尽了最大努力
I'm sure you did the best you could.

586
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:26,112
- 呃 嗯  - 你好像很累了
- Uh-uh.  - You sound tired.

587
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,281
你一定要记得偶尔休息一会儿
You gotta try to remember to sleep once in a while.

588
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:33,289
还记得上次自动售货机卖不出东西来是什么时候的事了?
When was the last time you had something that
 didn't come out of a vending machine?

589
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,331
是在Taco Bell
(快餐连锁)
Taco Bell.

590
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:40,027
当地官员说超过3000病例被确认感染了病毒
Local officials are now saying over 3000 
cases have been confirmed...

591
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:41,535
在西部郊区地方
...in the western suburbs...

592
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:45,197
以及拉姆齐、卡尔顿和圣路易斯县报告的首例感染者
...as well as the first cases reported in Ramsey,
 Carlton and Saint Louis counties...

593
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,809
病毒在持续蔓延
...as the virus continues to spread.

594
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,374
- 来了  - 国家卫生署发言人...
- Got it!  - A state Health Department spokesperson...

595
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:53,915
目前呼吁爱荷华州的医院…
...at this hour is appealing to hospitals
as far away as Iowa for medicine.

596
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:56,609
不要开门  不要开门
No, don't open that door. 
Don't open the door.

597
00:40:56,787 --> 00:41:00,917
- 是 安德鲁 - 呃  抱歉  安德鲁  我不能让你进来
- It's Andrew. - Uh, sorry, Andrew, I can't let you in.

598
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:03,286
我只是过来表示下  艾默霍先生
安慰I just came to give my condolences, Mr. Emhoff.

599
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,624
我明白  谢谢你的关心  呃  但是我不能让你进来
I understand. Thank you. Uh, but I can't let you in.

600
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:09,826
那我把这些花放在这儿吧
I'll just leave them, then.

601
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,128
不用 最好你一起带走吧  
 呃  还是谢谢你
No, actually, you should take them.
Uh, thank you, though.

602
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:17,402
- 我等下给你打电话  - 拜拜
- I'll call you later.  - Bye.

603
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:23,843
我们不能冒险让其他人进来
We just, you know, aren't gonna take any chances.

604
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:41,559
- 你知道这个怎么玩吗?
- 不 我完全不懂这个
- Do you know how to play this?
- No, I have no idea what's going on.

605
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:44,764
不过看起来很有趣
But it looks fun.

606
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:46,994
你要试试吗
You wanna try?

607
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:49,797
好吧
Okay.

608
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:53,336
我玩玩看
We'll see.

609
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,479
你好  你好
Hello. Hi.

610
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:57,136
噢  轮到我了
Oh, yeah, my turn, okay.

611
00:41:57,815 --> 00:42:00,147
押这个  好的
This one. Crab. Okay.

612
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:05,788
- 你赢了  - 噢  啊
- Hey. - Oh! Aah!

613
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:06,980
噢
Oh...

614
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:10,126
噢  天哪  我…  那是什么?  哪个是?
Oh, my God. I'll do... What is that? Which one is this?

615
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:11,761
- 筹码  - 那个是筹码
- Coin. - It's a coin.

616
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:16,622
噢  要吹口气  好的
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

617
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,928
已经开始传播了  我们只需知道具体方向
It's transmission. So we just need to know which direction.

618
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,970
可是也看不出是哪里来的
But we don't know where it comes from.

619
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:29,773
我认为病毒早于澳门就出现了
I would like to suggest
that the virus started before Macao...

620
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:31,710
最先出现的地方可能是香港
...and maybe here in Hong Kong.

621
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:43,951
你的这些猜测都没有足够的证据  
不能随便发表声明
You're considering pronouncements 
with serious implications.

622
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:48,994
通过摄影机是看不见病毒的
A virus is too small to be seen on video camera.

623
00:42:51,739 --> 00:42:54,406
疾病爆发第14天

624
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:15,754
不是吧
Please, God.

625
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,723
不要
Please, God.

626
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:28,301
不好  不好  不好
No, no, no.

627
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:46,483
你好
Hello?

628
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:50,058
我是821房间的艾琳・米尔斯医生
This is Dr. Erin Mears in Room 821.

629
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:56,796
我需要你查下过去24小时内进入过这个房间的人员名单
I need you to get me the names of everyone
who serviced this room in the last 24 hours.

630
00:43:56,967 --> 00:44:00,232
此外  你还要联系下
Also, you need to get in touch with the waiter...

631
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:02,599
昨晚到过这个房间的服务员
...who brought me my room service last night.

632
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:07,073
我需要所有他们的联系方式  
家里的电话  手机号 等等
I need all of their numbers.
Home, cell, everything, yes.

633
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:17,517
米尔丝? 米尔丝? 
Mears? Mears?

634
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:19,519
米切尔医生
Dr. Cheever...

635
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:22,123
我好像也感染了
...I think I'm sick.

636
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:25,887
什么?  怎么回事?  你有哪些症状?
What? What's going on?
What kind of symptoms do you have?

637
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:29,931
咽不下东西  头很痛
Can't swallow. Severe headache. Ahem.

638
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,863
你体温多少度?
What's your temperature?

639
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:35,062
- 华氏101.8°F(约38.7°C)  - 呃  听着 你不能…  你只是
- 101.8 - Uh, listen, you can't... You just...

640
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:36,866
- 你现在别慌  好吗  - 我知道
- You can't panic now, okay? - I know.

641
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:40,909
- 你一个人吗  - 我肯定感染了其他人
- Are you alone? - I've definitely infected other people.

642
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:42,875
你还不能确定
You don't know that.

643
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:47,644
- 我该做些什么?
- 嗯  你先留在房间里不要出去
- So, what should I do?
- Well, I want you to stay in your room.

644
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:50,378
我会通知健康部门  告知他们你的处境
I'll call the Health Department, tell them you're there.

645
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:54,888
- 艾琳  你不会有事的
- 是的  我知道  我知道
- Erin, just... You're gonna be okay.
- No, I know. I know.

646
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:56,993
- 好的  - 你得派其他人来执行任务了
- Okay. - You gotta send somebody else.

647
00:44:57,161 --> 00:44:59,561
我会的  你现在不要太担心了  好吗
Yes, but you don't worry about that right now, okay?

648
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,789
- 嘿  我…  -  你照顾好自己
- Hey, I'm... - You take care of yourself.

649
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:03,626
很抱歉我没能完成工作
I'm sorry I couldn't finish.

650
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:07,498
没关系  别想太多  我看看有什么办法能让你回来
That's... Never mind that. Let me see
what I can do about getting you back here.

651
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:10,765
- 我会尽可能让你健康的回来  - 谢谢
- I'm gonna get you home if I can, healthy.
 - Thank you.

652
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:13,842
- 你要坚持住  - 拜拜
- Now, you hang in there.  - Bye.

653
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:15,774
再见
Bye. Bye.

654
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:38,763
现在的问题是  我们不能运送尸体
The problem is, we just can't take delivery of the bodies.

655
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,865
我们自己的员工有些保险方面的问题
We have insurance issues with our own employees...

656
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,703
更别提要考虑送葬者的健康问题
...with our union, not to mention the health of the mourners, to consider.

657
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:51,579
我只是想把我妻子和继子安葬了
I just...  I wanna bury my wife and my stepson...

658
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,809
找一个我的朋友和家人能来举行仪式的地方
...and have a service where our friends and our family can come...

659
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:56,782
方便让他们悼念下
...and pay their respects and grieve.

660
00:45:57,321 --> 00:46:00,848
我理解你的心情  请节哀顺变
I understand, and I am truly sorry about your loss.

661
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:05,059
你考虑过其他的方式吗?
Have you considered other options?

662
00:46:05,562 --> 00:46:10,363
他们怎么能这样做  现在这儿有奇案
How can they do that? We have a family plot here.

663
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:13,560
他们让我们考虑下火化
They want us to think about cremation.

664
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:17,400
他们说目前这种情形  火化是最安全的方式
They just say that it's the safest thing in a situation like this.

665
00:46:17,574 --> 00:46:22,841
我想把我女儿和外孙
I wanna be buried with my daughter and grandson...

666
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:24,310
和我父母葬在一起
...with Jack and my parents.

667
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:26,346
我想大家能在一起
I want us all together.

668
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:30,851
他们不会运送的  萨拉
他们不会运送尸体
They're not gonna take them, Sarah.
They're not gonna take the bodies.

669
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:34,953
我会想想办法
我会想想办法
I'll figure something out.
I'll figure something out.

670
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:44,664
她确实犯过错误  米奇
She made mistakes, Mitch...

671
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:49,534
但是我知道她很爱你
...but I know she loved you very much.

672
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:03,879
我去买点喝的来  怎么样?
I'm gonna use some of these to
 get us some drinks, okay?

673
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:15,994
现在无法接通乔恩・尼尔
You have not reached Jon Neal...

674
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,532
你可以选择留个短消息
...but you will if you leave a message.

675
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:23,970
嗨  是我  呃…
Hi. It's me. Um...

676
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:30,312
我查过航班了  我可以赶上更早点的飞机
I checked the flights, and I can actually get an earlier flight...

677
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:36,146
如果可以在芝加哥滞留5个小时的话
...that would give me a five-hour layover in Chicago...

678
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:41,819
如果你想让我做点什么  请给我电话
...so let me know if that's something that you'd like me to do.

679
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:48,390
- 这是给你的小费  - 噢  谢谢
- That's for you, okay?  - Oh, thank you.

680
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:52,092
非常感谢  谢谢
Thank you very much. Thank you.

681
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:55,671
- 你忘了手机  - 噢  天哪
- Excuse me.  - Oh, my God.

682
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:01,771
谢谢
Thank...

683
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:06,314
- 这个乌克兰人捡到了艾默霍的手机 
- 这表明有接触
- Emhoff gave it to the Ukrainian.
- That just shows contact.

684
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:09,350
也可能是其他方式传播的  李辉的情况如何?
Maybe it went the other way. What about Li Fai?

685
00:48:10,153 --> 00:48:12,451
- 他当时也在赌场  -  看看这个
- He was on the casino floor.  - Watch this.

686
00:48:17,694 --> 00:48:21,494
喔  噢  太好了  过来一起合个影吧
 Whoa. Oh, good. Okay, come on.
Let's get one together. Ready?

687
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:24,225
干杯
Cheers.

688
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:25,698
嗯
Mm.

689
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:27,302
走吧
Let's go.

690
00:48:43,205 --> 00:48:46,436
这个就是12：08时和艾默霍在一起的那个人
That's him with Emhoff at 12:08.

691
00:48:46,608 --> 00:48:50,271
我可以给你看下电梯的
监控录像拍下的那个乌克兰女人
I can show you the Ukrainian woman
on the security camera in the elevator...

692
00:48:50,445 --> 00:48:53,141
倒退到20分钟之前她的房间的画面
...going back to her room 20 minutes earlier.

693
00:48:53,315 --> 00:48:55,977
在李晖开始工作前她就走了
She was gone before Li Fai started work.

694
00:48:56,718 --> 00:48:58,743
病毒源自这儿
It came from here.

695
00:48:59,321 --> 00:49:00,618
艾默霍是首例病人
Emhoff is the index patient.

696
00:49:00,789 --> 00:49:03,553
我们必须查出她来澳门前都去过哪些地方
We need to know everywhere she went before the casino.

697
00:49:03,992 --> 00:49:06,859
我想再看看她的行程安排
I want to see her itinerary again.

698
00:49:07,663 --> 00:49:10,598
他们说法国和美国人有治疗方法
They say the French and Americans have a cure.

699
00:49:10,766 --> 00:49:13,098
他们在秘密的研制
They're manufacturing it in secret.

700
00:49:13,268 --> 00:49:16,237
世界卫生组织也知道  但他们和美国人是串通的
WHO knows, but they're in bed with the Americans.

701
00:49:16,405 --> 00:49:19,431
- 听谁说的  - 网上传言
- Who says? - The Internet.

702
00:49:19,608 --> 00:49:24,045
- 网上传言?  你相信吗?  - 我不确定
- The Internet? And you believe it? - I don't know.

703
00:49:25,514 --> 00:49:26,845
你妈妈怎么样?
How's your mother?

704
00:49:29,685 --> 00:49:33,177
我们试过给她服用连翘  但是她没能熬过去
We tried forsythia, but she wasn't strong.

705
00:49:33,355 --> 00:49:36,085
大屿山有个万人坑
(香港境内最大的岛屿)
There's a mass grave in Lan Tau.

706
00:49:38,026 --> 00:49:39,755
对不起
I'm sorry.

707
00:49:43,398 --> 00:49:48,097
我准备把这些交给政府部门的人  
我们要把这些寄去日内瓦
I'm taking this to the ministry.
We need to send this to Geneva.

708
00:50:42,491 --> 00:50:44,584
你和我一起去
I need you to come with me.

709
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,352
- 你要做什么?  - 求你了
- What are you doing? - Please.

710
00:50:46,528 --> 00:50:47,893
不要
No.

711
00:50:48,063 --> 00:50:51,760
怎么回事?  孙峰  怎么了  你在干什么?
What's going on? Sun Feng.
What's going on? What are you doing?

712
00:51:08,417 --> 00:51:11,875
- 你在干什么?  - 对不起
- What are you doing? - I'm sorry.

713
00:51:12,053 --> 00:51:14,283
我们不能再等了
We couldn't wait any longer.

714
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:32,565
当他们在治愈其他人的时候   我们…
While they cure each other, we're here...

715
00:51:33,308 --> 00:51:35,469
是最后才能得到救治的人
...at the end of the line.

716
00:51:35,644 --> 00:51:38,670
整个村子就剩这些人了
This is what is left of my village.

717
00:51:40,215 --> 00:51:43,582
- 他们都感染了吗?  - 还没有
- Are they sick? - Not yet.

718
00:51:44,152 --> 00:51:46,382
我们会努力不让他们感染
And we're gonna keep it that way.

719
00:51:46,555 --> 00:51:49,718
在他们找到治愈方法前你必须呆在这儿
You'll stay here with us until they find a cure.

720
00:51:49,891 --> 00:51:52,086
我在这儿能帮什么忙?
How is that gonna help?

721
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:55,058
你必须想办法让我们优先得到治疗
You're gonna get us to the front of the line.

722
00:52:07,309 --> 00:52:09,243
米尔丝医生
Dr.Mears.

723
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,745
米切尔医生又来电话了
Dr. Cheever called again.

724
00:52:14,683 --> 00:52:18,551
现阶段我们也很艰难  没有足够的能力送你回去
We're just having a hard time
with the logistics of evacuating you.

725
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,278
找架飞机什么的
Finding a plane and all.

726
00:52:21,089 --> 00:52:22,989
你的手机在我这儿
I got your phone.

727
00:52:24,893 --> 00:52:29,057
米切尔医生交代  如果你方便可以给他打个电话
Dr. Cheever, he asked you to call if you feel up to it.

728
00:52:29,731 --> 00:52:31,562
我们为医护人员和急救先遣队
Now, we're setting up a special ward...

729
00:52:31,733 --> 00:52:34,759
在学校里准备了一个特殊的病房
...for medical personnel and first responders at the university.

730
00:52:34,936 --> 00:52:37,029
我想把你转移到那儿去
I wanna move you there...

731
00:52:37,205 --> 00:52:41,107
但护士工会现在请求停工
...but the nurses' union is calling a work stoppage...

732
00:52:41,276 --> 00:52:43,005
直到有效治疗感染的方法出现
...until protocols are in place.

733
00:52:43,178 --> 00:52:47,080
他们都是志愿者  但是…
There are volunteers, but it's just...

734
00:52:47,716 --> 00:52:52,278
现在很难确定什么地方是比较安全的
It's hard right now to know where's the right place.

735
00:52:52,454 --> 00:52:55,252
你在要求我在一个病人身上使用过量的资源
You're asking me to spend a lot of resources on one person...

736
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:57,118
目前这个情形  我不能那么做
...and right now, I can't do that.

737
00:52:57,292 --> 00:52:58,691
我想米切尔医生也会赞同我的做法
Dr. Mears would agree with me.

738
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:01,124
她是自己人  是我们派她去出任务的
She's one of our own, Lyle. We sent her up there.

739
00:53:01,296 --> 00:53:03,992
好吧  是我派她去的  我希望能带她回来
Okay, I sent her up there. I would like to go get her back.

740
00:53:04,165 --> 00:53:06,030
我们有架配有隔离舱的飞机
We have a plane with an isolation pod...

741
00:53:06,201 --> 00:53:09,261
特地为我们的人感染后回来用的  对吗?
...to bring our people in the field home when they're sick, right?

742
00:53:12,207 --> 00:53:14,334
到底怎么了  莱尔
What's going on, Lyle?

743
00:53:15,477 --> 00:53:19,277
华盛顿伊利诺伊州的一个众议员病倒了
There's a sick congressman from Illinois in D.C.

744
00:53:19,447 --> 00:53:23,076
他在芝加哥度假
He was in Chicago over the holiday.

745
00:53:23,652 --> 00:53:25,517
他正乘坐这架飞机返回家
They're using the pod to fly him home.

746
00:53:25,687 --> 00:53:28,315
之后他们打算关闭中途岛和芝加哥奥黑尔国际机场
Then they're closing down Midway and O'Hare.

747
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:31,926
政府人员正调用国民警卫队  目前在设置路障
The governor is calling the National Guard.
They're setting up roadblocks.

748
00:53:32,093 --> 00:53:34,618
他们正关停贸易和公共交通
They're shutting down trade, public transportation.

749
00:53:34,796 --> 00:53:36,923
已经禁止通行了
The Teamsters are pulling drivers off the road.

750
00:53:37,098 --> 00:53:39,589
- 还是会有漏网之鱼的  - 没错
- People are still gonna slip through.  - Yes, they will.

751
00:53:39,768 --> 00:53:42,794
特勤局正转移总统到秘密基地
The Secret Service is moving the president underground.

752
00:53:42,971 --> 00:53:46,737
国会的人正考虑如何通过网络来解决问题
Congress is figuring out how to work online.

753
00:53:46,908 --> 00:53:48,739
如果这些话传出去
When the word goes out...

754
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:52,971
这些银行、加油站、杂货店肯定会大乱的
...there will be a run on the banks,
gas stations, grocery stores, you name it.

755
00:53:53,148 --> 00:53:56,015
公众将会惊慌失措  到时候可比病毒还棘手了
People will panic. The virus will be the least of our worries.

756
00:53:56,184 --> 00:53:57,446
会闹翻天的
It will tip over now.

757
00:53:57,719 --> 00:54:02,520
我们只是需要尽可能封锁消息
We just need to make sure
that nobody knows until everybody knows.

758
00:54:02,691 --> 00:54:04,386
我体温是华氏101°(约38.3°C)
My temperature's 101.

759
00:54:06,127 --> 00:54:08,425
比之前更高了
Higher than it was earlier.

760
00:54:09,731 --> 00:54:11,631
我头很痛
My head hurts...

761
00:54:12,601 --> 00:54:15,263
嗓子也很难受
...and my throat feels like it's closing.

762
00:54:16,338 --> 00:54:18,363
这个是连翘
This is forsythia.

763
00:54:18,873 --> 00:54:24,869
自从出现症状一来我就一直在服用
I've been taking it since the onset of the symptoms.

764
00:54:37,926 --> 00:54:41,953
如果我能活到明天  你们就知道这东西是管用的
If I'm here tomorrow, you'll know it works.

765
00:54:43,798 --> 00:54:46,995
真实的血清  我是艾伦・克鲁姆维德
Truth Serum Now. I'm Alan Krumwiede.

766
00:54:48,837 --> 00:54:50,998
大概会死多少人?
How many people are gonna die?

767
00:54:51,172 --> 00:54:53,265
这个嘛  在1918年…
Well, in 1918...

768
00:54:53,441 --> 00:54:56,274
1%的人口最后死于西班牙流感
...1 percent of the population died from Spanish flu.

769
00:54:56,444 --> 00:55:00,039
它是一种新型病毒  就像现在这种病毒  没人见过
It was novel, like this, no one had ever seen it before.

770
00:55:00,215 --> 00:55:04,311
- 1%的美国人死了?
- 是1%的全球人口
- One percent of America?
- One percent of the world.

771
00:55:04,853 --> 00:55:08,118
将有7千万的人会因此丧命  也许更多
As many as 70 million people could die,　baby, maybe more.

772
00:55:10,592 --> 00:55:13,288
- 那我们该怎么办?
- 我不知道  我们在寻求解决方案
- So, what do we do?
- I don't know. We try to figure it out.

773
00:55:13,461 --> 00:55:15,656
这也是我派米尔丝医生前往明尼苏达州调查的原因
This is why I sent Mears up there, to Minnesota.

774
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:17,422
但现在我不能把她带回来
And now I can't get her back.

775
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:20,159
她也感染了  奥布里  而我什么也不能做
She's sick, Aubrey, and I can't do anything for her...

776
00:55:20,335 --> 00:55:21,802
因为那里没有护士
...because there are no nurses.

777
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:24,268
- 为什么没有护士?  - 因为他们正在举行罢工
- Why not? - Because they're on strike.

778
00:55:24,439 --> 00:55:27,203
- 他们怎么能这样做?
- 因为对于这种病毒他们也无能为力
- How can they do that?
- Because there's nothing they can do.

779
00:55:27,375 --> 00:55:29,707
健康的人群正和感染了的病人们相离很近
We're putting healthy people next to sick people...

780
00:55:29,878 --> 00:55:32,142
希望这些健康的人群不会染病
...and hoping the healthy people don't get sick.

781
00:55:32,313 --> 00:55:36,147
- 对此我表示遗憾  埃利斯  但这不是你的错
- 是我派她去那出任务的  奥布里
- - I'm sorry, Ellis, but that's not your fault.
I sent her up there, Aubrey.

782
00:55:36,317 --> 00:55:40,276
逝者已矣 生者如斯  别太自责  好吗
If one in four are dying, that means
three out of four are living, right?

783
00:55:40,455 --> 00:55:42,946
空白时间轴
So the odds are in her favor.

784
00:55:43,491 --> 00:55:46,483
我想你立即驱车前往亚特兰大
I want you to get in your car
and drive down here to Atlanta now.

785
00:55:46,661 --> 00:55:48,356
听到了吗   奥布里
You hear me, Aubrey?

786
00:55:50,498 --> 00:55:51,760
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

787
00:55:51,933 --> 00:55:54,458
我想你现在驾车离开芝加哥
I want you to get in your car and leave Chicago.

788
00:55:54,636 --> 00:55:58,231
到亚特兰大去  你自己一人开车
I want you to drive here to Atlanta. Drive by yourself.

789
00:55:58,406 --> 00:56:02,775
抓紧时间  赶紧  不要告诉任何人  中途也别停下来
You do it. You do it now. Don't tell anyone and don't stop.

790
00:56:02,944 --> 00:56:06,744
远离其他人群  明白吗  和其他人保持距离
Stay away from other people, understand?
Keep your distance from other people.

791
00:56:06,915 --> 00:56:09,509
你上路后打个电话给我   奥布里
Call me when you're on the road, Aubrey.

792
00:56:18,493 --> 00:56:20,120
罗杰
Roger.

793
00:56:21,896 --> 00:56:22,988
你刚全听到了?
Did you hear?

794
00:56:23,164 --> 00:56:26,190
我也有家人  米切尔医生
I got people too, Dr. Cheever.

795
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:28,267
我们都有亲人
We all do.

796
00:56:48,089 --> 00:56:49,681
喂
Hello?

797
00:56:49,858 --> 00:56:53,055
嘿  你怎么不一起吃晚餐?
Hey, friend, what's up with blowing off dinner?

798
00:56:53,228 --> 00:56:57,324
- 对不起 莉斯  - 你怎么感觉怪怪的  你还好吗
- I'm sorry, Liz. - Why you so flaky? You feeling okay?

799
00:56:58,032 --> 00:57:00,159
这该死的流感
This flu sh...

800
00:57:00,335 --> 00:57:04,465
实在是很怪异  埃利斯怎么说?
Stuff is really spooky. What does Ellis say?

801
00:57:07,275 --> 00:57:10,301
他说情况…  他说情况很严重
He says it's... He says it's serious.

802
00:57:13,815 --> 00:57:15,840
很严重是什么意思?
What do you mean, serious?

803
00:57:16,017 --> 00:57:17,245
你在哪儿?
Where are you?

804
00:57:17,418 --> 00:57:19,909
- 我准备离开芝加哥  - 什么?
- I'm getting out of town.  - What?

805
00:57:24,592 --> 00:57:27,220
我透露点信息给你吧
I'm gonna tell you something...

806
00:57:27,395 --> 00:57:29,488
你不要说出去
...and you're not gonna repeat it.

807
00:57:52,946 --> 00:57:55,075
疾病爆发第18天

808
00:58:05,967 --> 00:58:08,595
- 你就不能捂着嘴再咳吗?  - 去你妈的  
- Cover your mouth, please. - Fuck off, lady.

809
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:12,171
今天只有50份剂量的了
We will only be able to give out 50 doses today.

810
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:14,137
- 什么  - 这是我们的配额
- What? - That's our allotment.

811
00:58:15,577 --> 00:58:16,805
简直是胡扯
This is bullshit.

812
00:58:16,978 --> 00:58:20,072
嘿  那谁  谁允许你插队了  太过分了
Hey. There... Excuse me, there's a line here. Excuse me!

813
00:58:52,747 --> 00:58:54,442
天哪
Jesus.

814
00:58:55,083 --> 00:58:58,449
怎么没有消防人员来救火?
Where's the fire department?

815
00:59:14,369 --> 00:59:16,428
难道都没人值班吗
Is anyone even working here?

816
00:59:16,604 --> 00:59:18,663
你去拿麦片
Just get the cereal.

817
00:59:23,044 --> 00:59:26,343
- 乔瑞  别碰任何东西  -  救救我
- Jory, don't touch anything. - Help me.

818
00:59:29,918 --> 00:59:31,647
赶紧丢掉你的手套
Okay, take your gloves off.

819
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:34,247
把手给我
Here, give me your hands.

820
00:59:39,027 --> 00:59:40,961
快走  快走
Okay, okay, come on.

821
00:59:44,499 --> 00:59:46,228
- 快走  快   - 嗯
- Come on, come on.  - Unh.

822
00:59:47,035 --> 00:59:48,730
嘿  你们给我滚开点  滚开
Hey, get away from there. Get away.

823
00:59:55,643 --> 00:59:57,304
锁上门
Lock the door.

824
01:00:02,417 --> 01:00:05,477
请回到你的车里  先生  请回到车里
Get back in your car, sir. Get back in your car.

825
01:00:05,653 --> 01:00:07,553
-  不  不 我没感染  我是免疫的 - 请退后
- No, no, I'm not... I'm immune.  - Stay back.

826
01:00:07,722 --> 01:00:08,848
我以前得过
I've already had it.

827
01:00:09,023 --> 01:00:11,116
- 我女儿并没有感染  - 她病了?
- And my daughter's not sick. - She's sick?

828
01:00:11,292 --> 01:00:14,056
她没染病  没有  我们只是想去威斯康星州
She's not, no. We're just trying to get to Wisconsin.

829
01:00:14,228 --> 01:00:17,061
道路已经封锁了  政府要求隔离检疫
The border is sealed. The governor has declared a quarantine.

830
01:00:17,231 --> 01:00:18,255
请回到你车里
Get back in your car.

831
01:00:18,433 --> 01:00:20,867
不  我们才不要回去  我们想离开这儿
No, we don't wanna go back there.
We wanna go across.

832
01:00:21,035 --> 01:00:23,833
- 这是不可能的  请回车上去
- 我们没有感染
- There is no way across. Get in your car.
- We're not sick.

833
01:00:24,005 --> 01:00:27,168
请回车上去  否则我要逮捕你了
Get back in your car or I will detain you.

834
01:00:27,342 --> 01:00:29,003
回哪儿去?
Where?

835
01:00:29,177 --> 01:00:30,542
回车上去
Get in the car!

836
01:00:42,857 --> 01:00:45,724
- 怎么了  - 我们必须回去
- What happened?  - We have to go home.

837
01:00:56,590 --> 01:00:58,272
疾病预防控制中心的人在撒谎

838
01:01:07,749 --> 01:01:09,683
你在这儿干什么
What are you doing here?

839
01:01:11,786 --> 01:01:14,550
我觉得自己病发了
I think I had a seizure.

840
01:01:15,456 --> 01:01:16,923
糟透了
Oh.

841
01:01:17,091 --> 01:01:21,528
药店里已经买不到药了
I can't... I can't find any in the stores. I tried.

842
01:01:21,696 --> 01:01:25,792
听着  我这里也没有了  有人闯进来过
Look, I don't have any here. People broke in.

843
01:01:27,535 --> 01:01:29,366
我  我怀孕了  艾伦
I'm... I'm pregnant, Alan.

844
01:01:29,537 --> 01:01:35,635
我有…  我有钱
And I have... I have money.

845
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:39,576
我可以给你钱
I can give you some money.

846
01:01:40,214 --> 01:01:42,808
洛伦  你不该出来到处走的
Lorraine, you shouldn't be out.

847
01:01:42,984 --> 01:01:44,042
- 求你了  艾伦  - 回家去吧
- Please, Alan.  - Go home.

848
01:01:44,218 --> 01:01:46,982
如果我得到了连翘  到时候我会带给你的
I'll bring it to you when I get it.

849
01:02:03,304 --> 01:02:07,638
我在想能否再弄张毯子来
I was wondering if I could get another blanket.

850
01:02:07,809 --> 01:02:09,538
这张太潮湿了
This one's very damp now.

851
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:12,235
很抱歉  先生  但是已经没有多余的毯子了
I'm truly sorry, sir. We're out of blankets.

852
01:02:12,413 --> 01:02:16,213
我们希望能收到更多捐赠  我们已经发出公告了
We're hoping for more to be donated. We put the word out.

853
01:02:16,384 --> 01:02:19,512
那暖气呢  温度能调高点吗
What about the heat? Can we turn that up?

854
01:02:19,687 --> 01:02:21,450
我想想办法
I'll find out.

855
01:03:06,501 --> 01:03:11,097
- 装尸袋什么时候用完的?  - 2天以前
- When did we run out of body bags? - Two days ago.

856
01:03:11,272 --> 01:03:15,436
我们想从加拿大再运点来
但是他们想等等看
We're trying to get more in from Canada,
but they just wanna wait and see.

857
01:03:22,917 --> 01:03:28,446
拒绝谎言  拒绝谎言  拒绝谎言
No more lies! No more lies! No more lies!

858
01:03:41,135 --> 01:03:44,070
网上传言说印度和其他地区
There are stories on the Internet that in India and elsewhere...

859
01:03:44,238 --> 01:03:47,867
利巴韦林药物在抵抗这种病毒方面有一定疗效
 ...the drug ribavirin has been shown
to be effective against this virus.

860
01:03:48,042 --> 01:03:51,409
国土安全局告知疾控中心
除非能确保该种药物有足够的库存
Yet Homeland Security is telling the CDC
not to make any announcements...

861
01:03:51,579 --> 01:03:53,843
否则不能发布任何声明
...until stockpiles of the drug could be secured.

862
01:03:54,015 --> 01:03:57,712
嗯  我们会继续评估几种药物的作用
Well, Dr. Gupta, there continue  to be evaluations of several drugs.

863
01:03:57,885 --> 01:03:59,716
其中包括利巴韦林
Ribavirin is among them.

864
01:03:59,887 --> 01:04:03,755
但目前的情况  抵御病毒最好的方法是远离人群
But right now, our best defense
has been social distancing.

865
01:04:03,925 --> 01:04:06,325
不要握手  如果染病一定要留在家里
No hand-shaking, staying home when you're sick...

866
01:04:06,494 --> 01:04:08,553
经常洗手
...washing your hands frequently.

867
01:04:08,729 --> 01:04:12,426
你能告诉我们  迄今为止   
有多少人死于这种病毒吗
Can you tell us, to date, how many people have died from this virus?

868
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:17,037
很难说  我们正在努力确认这个统计数字
Very difficult. We're still working
on, uh, confirming that number.

869
01:04:17,205 --> 01:04:19,400
全国有50个不同的州
There are 50 different states in this country...

870
01:04:19,574 --> 01:04:22,270
意味着有50个不同的健康部门
...which means there are 50 different Health Departments...

871
01:04:22,443 --> 01:04:25,207
拥有50种不同的应急方案
...followed by 50 different protocols.

872
01:04:25,846 --> 01:04:28,212
现在有请艾伦・克鲁姆维德参与到讨论中来
Let me bring Alan Krumwiede into this debate as well.

873
01:04:28,382 --> 01:04:29,906
呃   艾伦是个自由撰稿人
Uh, Alan's a freelance journalist.

874
01:04:30,084 --> 01:04:33,144
呃  他是第一个跟踪调查"日本新光公交车死亡男子"视频的人
Uh, he was the first to track the "Shinko Bus Man" video.

875
01:04:33,321 --> 01:04:34,982
呃  艾伦  今天在推特上
Uh, Alan, today on Twitter...

876
01:04:35,156 --> 01:04:38,819
你说关于这种病毒的真相一直被
...you wrote that the truth about this virus
is being kept from the world...

877
01:04:38,993 --> 01:04:41,518
疾控中心  世界卫生组织掩盖着
...by the CDC, by the World Health Organization...

878
01:04:41,696 --> 01:04:44,756
让某些人从中窃取暴利
...to allow friends of the administration to benefit from it...

879
01:04:44,932 --> 01:04:47,196
包括财政上和物质方面
...both financially and physically.

880
01:04:47,368 --> 01:04:52,305
嗯  目前我们知道有些药物在防治病毒方面
是有一定疗效的  比如连翘
Uh, there are therapies we know
are effective right now, like forsythia...

881
01:04:52,473 --> 01:04:54,964
但这些并没有公布在疾控中心的官网上
...and they don't even appear  on the CDC website.

882
01:04:55,142 --> 01:04:56,769
在你的博客中  还写到
On your blog, you also wrote...

883
01:04:56,944 --> 01:05:00,880
世界卫生组织和制药公司是串通好了的
...that the World Health Organization
is in bed with pharmaceutical companies?

884
01:05:01,048 --> 01:05:02,572
因为他们确实是串通的
Because they are.

885
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:06,015
他们就是从中获利的代表  他们狼狈为奸
That's who stands to gain from this.
They're working hand in glove.

886
01:05:06,587 --> 01:05:08,646
他们的贼手正伸向我们的口袋
And the hand is reaching into our pockets.

887
01:05:08,823 --> 01:05:11,986
疾控中心在研究连翘和其他同类疗法
The CDC is exploring forsythia and other homeopathic treatments.

888
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:15,492
但是目前  没有科学依据能支撑这些言论
But right now, there's no science to back any of these claims.

889
01:05:15,663 --> 01:05:20,066
米切尔医生或者掌控他的幕后人士能因此获利
Or no way Dr. Cheever or the people who put him into power can profit from it.

890
01:05:20,234 --> 01:05:21,667
我们不排除任何可能性
We're not ruling anything out.

891
01:05:21,836 --> 01:05:25,203
人们被感染了  他们快要死了  而我们却在这…
There are people who are sick, people who are dying
 and we are doing...

892
01:05:25,373 --> 01:05:27,807
他们不再保证我们的安全
They're not keeping us safe
 from this any more than...

893
01:05:27,975 --> 01:05:30,273
我们关心所有的美国公民的生命安全
We're concerned about every American citizen.

894
01:05:30,444 --> 01:05:36,007
米切尔医生在说"每个美国公民"的时候是有点虚伪的
Dr. Cheever is being a bit disingenuous
when he says "every American citizen."

895
01:05:36,183 --> 01:05:39,641
我们在竭尽全力寻找病毒源头  如何抵御病毒
We're working very hard to find out
where this virus came from, treat it...

896
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:41,583
以及接种疫苗
...and vaccinate against it if we can.

897
01:05:41,756 --> 01:05:43,815
问题是我们目前还没有发现  我们还没找到有效的方法
We don't know all of that yet, we just don't.

898
01:05:43,991 --> 01:05:46,357
我们目前所知的是病毒传染的方式有
What we do know is that in order to become sick...

899
01:05:46,527 --> 01:05:50,395
和带病毒的人群有接触  
或者摸过这些病人碰过的东西
...you have to first come in contact with
a sick person or something they touched.

900
01:05:51,232 --> 01:05:54,793
大家要保持镇定  不要被谣言蛊惑
In order to get scared, all you have to do
is come in contact with a rumor...

901
01:05:54,969 --> 01:05:56,402
或者网上传言等
...television or the Internet.

902
01:05:56,570 --> 01:06:01,007
我觉得克鲁姆维德先生散步谣言的危害
比这种疾病本身还要危险得多
I think what Mr. Krumwiede is spreading
is far more dangerous than the disease.

903
01:06:01,175 --> 01:06:03,075
-  噢  真的吗  - 没错
- Oh, really?  - Yes.

904
01:06:03,244 --> 01:06:04,768
- 真是搞笑  - 有什么好笑的 
- That's funny. - What's funny?

905
01:06:04,945 --> 01:06:07,209
你在说笑吧  如果大家有上Facebook的话
You're funny, because if you check on Facebook...

906
01:06:07,381 --> 01:06:11,147
你们会发现这都归咎于米切尔医生
...you'll find a communiqué attributed
to Dr. Cheever by Elizabeth Nygaard...

907
01:06:11,319 --> 01:06:15,016
在公布芝加哥人群检疫结果前做过不光彩的事情
...about the quarantine of Chicago hours
before it was announced to the public.

908
01:06:15,189 --> 01:06:17,487
这就是我认为他有点虚伪的原因
That's why I think he's a bit disingenuous...

909
01:06:17,658 --> 01:06:20,684
当他说会平等对待所有人  
而不仅仅是他的朋友们时
...when he says equal care 
for all and not just his friends.

910
01:06:21,562 --> 01:06:23,928
米切尔医生 你打算如何回应这些指控
Some pretty wild allegations here, Dr. Cheever.

911
01:06:24,098 --> 01:06:27,033
你能透露下这个交谈的内容及发生时间吗
Can you tell us what communication appeared and when?

912
01:06:27,201 --> 01:06:29,635
你和Nygaard之间真正的关系是什么?
What is the nature of your relationship with Nygaard?

913
01:06:29,804 --> 01:06:32,898
我没有在任何社交网站上看到这件事情归咎于我的新闻
I'm not aware of anything attributed to me on any social network.

914
01:06:33,074 --> 01:06:36,737
我确定你没有  事实摆在那儿  事实摆在那儿
I'm sure you're not. It is there. It is there.

915
01:06:36,911 --> 01:06:40,142
告诉他们R0平均数为2真正的含义  米切尔医生  
Tell them what an R-nought of two really means, Dr. Cheever.

916
01:06:40,314 --> 01:06:42,248
给他们讲点数学知识 如何?
Teach them some math. Hm?

917
01:06:42,817 --> 01:06:44,148
你不愿意?  我可会这么做
No? I'll do it.

918
01:06:44,318 --> 01:06:47,947
第一天  有2个人感染  然后会有4个人感染
On day 1, there were two people with it
and then there were four.

919
01:06:51,826 --> 01:06:54,590
接下来是256人    再然后是65000人
...but next it's 256, and then it's 65,000...

920
01:06:54,762 --> 01:06:57,253
你会发现你周围的人很多都感染了
...and it's behind you, above you, and all around you.

921
01:06:57,431 --> 01:07:00,457
如此持续计算30步  将会有10亿人感染
In 30 steps, it's a billion sick.

922
01:07:00,634 --> 01:07:03,330
只需要3个月时间   这个大家都可以很容易计算出来的
Three months. It's a math problem you can do on a napkin.

923
01:07:03,504 --> 01:07:05,495
这就是我们会面临的事实
And that's where we're headed.

924
01:07:05,673 --> 01:07:08,733
这就是你不愿意告诉我们死亡人数的原因
And that's why you won't even tell us the number of the dead...

925
01:07:08,909 --> 01:07:10,103
你会告诉我们吗  米切尔医生?
...will you, Dr. Cheever?

926
01:07:10,277 --> 01:07:12,939
但你却告诉你的朋友们赶在其他人之前
But you'll tell your friends when to get out of Chicago...

927
01:07:13,114 --> 01:07:15,674
离开芝加哥
...before anyone else has a chance.

928
01:07:17,952 --> 01:07:20,614
他们只是在寻找替罪羊
They're looking for a scapegoat.

929
01:07:20,788 --> 01:07:23,154
你别想太多
You just made it easy.

930
01:07:25,025 --> 01:07:28,119
我们没和总检察长说的原因是
The only reason we're not taking this to the attorney general...

931
01:07:28,295 --> 01:07:30,354
现在找不到人来顶替你
...is because we can't replace you right now.

932
01:07:30,531 --> 01:07:33,830
但是会对你进行调查  你明白了吗
But there's gonna be an investigation. Do you understand that?

933
01:07:38,272 --> 01:07:41,332
此外  我们不想再看到你上电视
And we don't wanna see you in front of the cameras anymore.

934
01:07:42,961 --> 01:07:46,259
疾病爆发第21天

935
01:07:52,953 --> 01:07:56,047
喔  喔   喔  这是哪来的  
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where did you come from?

936
01:07:58,793 --> 01:08:01,523
- 被替换了  - 结果是好是坏?
- It's mutated.  - Which way, better or worse?

937
01:08:01,695 --> 01:08:04,721
赶上非洲艾滋病感染人口了
It's moved into an African HIV AIDS population.

938
01:08:04,899 --> 01:08:07,891
德班的人群太分散了
The Durban cluster is highly divergent.

939
01:08:09,503 --> 01:08:13,303
现在有了新的R0平均数  埃利斯  不再是2了
We have a new R-nought, Ellis. It's not two anymore.

940
01:08:31,192 --> 01:08:34,525
我还以为你说一旦我们培育成功病毒  
就可以研制疫苗预防它了
I thought you said once we could
grow it, we could vaccinate against it.

941
01:08:34,695 --> 01:08:38,825
我们试图利用死亡的病毒
和蛋白质神经组织结合来增强免疫反应
We tried using dead virus combined
with atrophins to boost immune response.

942
01:08:38,999 --> 01:08:40,023
结果呢
And?

943
01:08:40,201 --> 01:08:42,795
没有产生保护性的抗体  死了很多用于试验的猴子
No protective antibodies, a lot of dead monkeys.

944
01:08:42,970 --> 01:08:46,701
- 好的一方面呢
- 现在我们必须试试减毒株病毒
- Can you get to the good news?
- Now we have to try a live attenuated virus.

945
01:08:46,941 --> 01:08:48,431
- 像小儿麻痹症那种  - 没错
- Like with polio? - Exactly.

946
01:08:48,609 --> 01:08:50,304
减毒株唯一危险的是
The only danger with a live virus...

947
01:08:50,478 --> 01:08:53,914
它可能会恢复到野生型并杀死宿主
...is the possibility that it will revert to wild type and kill the host.

948
01:08:54,081 --> 01:08:56,413
什么时候能得到试验结果
And when will we know about that?

949
01:08:57,218 --> 01:08:58,879
这得问那些试验猴子了
I'll ask the monkeys.

950
01:08:59,053 --> 01:09:01,851
截止目前  感染人群死亡率在
As of right now, the mortality rate is fluctuating...

951
01:09:02,022 --> 01:09:04,684
25%-30之间波动
...between 25 and 30 percent...

952
01:09:04,859 --> 01:09:07,623
根据基本的医疗条件
...depending upon underlying medical conditions...

953
01:09:07,795 --> 01:09:11,287
社会经济因素、营养供给、新鲜的水
...socioeconomic factors, nutrition, fresh water.

954
01:09:11,465 --> 01:09:13,057
随着新的突变
With the new mutation...

955
01:09:13,234 --> 01:09:17,637
我们预测RO平均数不会小于4
...we are predicting an R-nought of no less than four.

956
01:09:17,805 --> 01:09:20,330
加上没有疫苗  我们预料…
And without a vaccine, we can anticipate...

957
01:09:20,508 --> 01:09:27,107
这个星球上多达1/12的人口将会感染这种疾病
...that approximately one in 12 people
on the planet will contract the disease.

958
01:10:27,468 --> 01:10:31,402
疾病爆发第26天

959
01:10:40,154 --> 01:10:41,712
大家请注意
Folks, attention.

960
01:10:41,889 --> 01:10:45,757
感谢大家的耐心  我们也在尽力而为
We appreciate your patience
and we're doing the best we can.

961
01:10:45,926 --> 01:10:49,487
我们已经用完了本来为今天准备的肉食
We have exhausted our supply
of meals ready-to-eat for today.

962
01:10:49,663 --> 01:10:51,028
什么
What?

963
01:10:51,198 --> 01:10:52,688
请大家保持镇定  我们会…
Please remain calm. We'll be sending...

964
01:10:52,866 --> 01:10:55,494
请…   嘿   有人能去帮帮忙吗
Please... Hey. Can we get some help over here?

965
01:10:56,870 --> 01:10:58,599
请大家保持秩序
Leave the park in an orderly fashion.

966
01:10:58,772 --> 01:11:00,239
救救我
Help me!

967
01:11:04,778 --> 01:11:06,245
- 你还好吗  - 谢谢
- You okay? - Thank you.

968
01:11:06,413 --> 01:11:09,177
-  对不起  他们抢走一个  - 到卡车那边看看
- Sorry, they got one of them.  - Get the trucks!

969
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:11,813
去检查下卡车
Get the trucks!

970
01:11:28,202 --> 01:11:31,330
那儿   那儿什么也没有
There's... There's nothing in there!

971
01:11:32,272 --> 01:11:35,207
有证据表明  现在美国的死亡人数…
As the death toll in the United States is now believed...

972
01:11:35,376 --> 01:11:36,707
已经达到了二百五十万人
...to have reached 2.5 million...

973
01:11:36,877 --> 01:11:40,244
今天总统在一个秘密地点发布了一个声明
...the president issued a statement today
from an undisclosed location...

974
01:11:40,414 --> 01:11:43,747
在达拉斯  克里夫兰 迈阿密和凤凰城发生了暴乱后
...implementing mandatory curfews
in major metropolitan areas...

975
01:11:43,917 --> 01:11:47,785
决定在大城市强制性执行宵禁
...after a second consecutive day of riots
in Dallas, Miami, Cleveland and Phoenix.

976
01:11:47,955 --> 01:11:50,947
执法人员缺勤率接近25%
Absenteeism in law enforcement is nearing 25 percent...

977
01:11:51,125 --> 01:11:52,592
根据报告
...according to reports...

978
01:12:18,519 --> 01:12:21,317
由于大量的911电话打进来…
Because of the high volume of 911 calls...

979
01:12:21,488 --> 01:12:23,422
请遵照以下提示
...please use the following directory:

980
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:29,859
如果你有该疾病症状  请挂掉电话  拨打专线612-188-6336
If you have symptoms, please hang up and call 612-188-6336.

981
01:12:30,030 --> 01:12:34,057
报告死亡信息或者撤销登记  请按1

982
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:39,842
疾病爆发第29天

983
01:12:45,145 --> 01:12:47,170
喂?  有人在家吗?
Hello? Anybody home?

984
01:12:50,284 --> 01:12:51,945
马克在吗
Hey, Mark?

985
01:13:24,451 --> 01:13:26,043
嘿  乔瑞?
Hey, Jor?

986
01:13:31,558 --> 01:13:33,082
乔瑞
Jor?

987
01:14:03,524 --> 01:14:05,822
我的手都冻僵了
I can't feel my hands.

988
01:14:09,329 --> 01:14:11,763
你把我雪天使播放器弄坏了
That messed up my snow angel.

989
01:14:13,033 --> 01:14:14,193
我没感染  乔瑞
I'm fine, Jory.

990
01:14:14,368 --> 01:14:17,667
如果我们两个都没染病  那么我们不会互相传染的
If neither of us have it, then we can't give it to each other.

991
01:14:23,143 --> 01:14:24,508
-  离她远点儿  -  爸爸
- Get away from her.  - Dad!

992
01:14:24,678 --> 01:14:26,771
- 离开这儿 离开这儿  - 爸爸
- Get away. Get away.  - Dad!

993
01:14:26,947 --> 01:14:29,415
- 你干什么?  - 你给我呆那儿
- What are you doing? - Stay there.

994
01:14:29,583 --> 01:14:31,744
回家去吧   安德鲁
Go home, Andrew.

995
01:14:40,727 --> 01:14:41,751
起来
Get up.

996
01:14:50,204 --> 01:14:52,434
有进展吗
Are we even close?

997
01:14:53,907 --> 01:14:56,398
就算我们现在已经培育出有用的疫苗
If we even had a viable vaccine right now...

998
01:14:56,577 --> 01:14:59,774
还得做临床试验  这至少得花几个星期
...we would still have to do human trials
 and that would take weeks.

999
01:14:59,947 --> 01:15:02,541
之后必须得到批准
And then we would have to 
get clearance and approval...

1000
01:15:02,716 --> 01:15:04,581
联系药品制造商和分销渠道
...figure out manufacturing and distribution.

1001
01:15:04,751 --> 01:15:06,116
可能要花几个月时间
That would take months.

1002
01:15:06,286 --> 01:15:08,550
然后才能对幸存者预防接种疫苗
And then training survivors to give inoculations.

1003
01:15:08,722 --> 01:15:11,213
多拖几个月  死亡人数将会更多
More months, more deaths.

1004
01:15:11,758 --> 01:15:13,623
国土安全局想知道
Well, Homeland Security wants to know...

1005
01:15:13,794 --> 01:15:17,696
我们能否把疫苗投放在输水管道里  
就像氟化物那样
...if we can put a vaccination
in the water supply, like fluoride.

1006
01:15:17,865 --> 01:15:19,662
可以立即治愈所有人
Cure everyone all at once.

1007
01:15:21,501 --> 01:15:24,902
我马上要回家了  埃利斯  现在很晚了
I'm going home now, Ellis. It's getting late.

1008
01:15:25,072 --> 01:15:26,505
圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas.

1009
01:15:30,978 --> 01:15:32,912
圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas.

1010
01:17:02,803 --> 01:17:04,703
- 你在干什么  - 没事的  爸爸
- What are you doing? - It's okay, Dad.

1011
01:17:04,871 --> 01:17:09,035
- 不  这太危险了
- 你还记得巴尼・马歇尔医生吗
- No, it's not okay.
- Do you remember Dr. Barry Marshall?

1012
01:17:09,209 --> 01:17:13,543
他认为溃疡是由细菌引发的  而不是压力
Thought that bacteria caused ulcers, not stress.

1013
01:17:13,714 --> 01:17:15,807
他给自己注射了药物  最后治好了
Gave himself the bug and then cured himself.

1014
01:17:15,983 --> 01:17:18,144
你跟我提起过他
You taught me about him.

1015
01:17:19,619 --> 01:17:22,281
我在测试自己研制的疫苗
I'm testing my vaccine.

1016
01:17:23,223 --> 01:17:25,350
不  这次情况不同
No, this is different.

1017
01:17:25,525 --> 01:17:27,891
我不想看到你染病
I don't want to get you sick.

1018
01:17:28,061 --> 01:17:29,585
艾丽  你不能冒险
Ally, you can't take that chance.

1019
01:17:29,997 --> 01:17:34,093
噢  爸爸  你能取得现在的成就
是因为你一直注重实践
Oh, Dad, you're here because you 
stayed in your practice...

1020
01:17:34,267 --> 01:17:36,963
别人都回家了  而你还在治疗病人
...treating sick people after everyone else went home.

1021
01:17:37,137 --> 01:17:40,903
你在冒险  你每天都在冒险
You took that chance.
You took that chance every day.

1022
01:17:51,218 --> 01:17:52,845
怎么了
What?

1023
01:17:55,288 --> 01:17:57,256
他获得了诺贝尔奖
He won a Nobel Prize.

1024
01:17:57,424 --> 01:18:00,951
-  是的  我知道  爸爸  呵呵  - 巴尼・马歇尔
- Yes, I know, Dad. Ha, ha.  - Barry Marshall.

1025
01:18:10,837 --> 01:18:13,704
食品和药物管理局正在
The Food and Drug Administration
 is accelerating approval...

1026
01:18:13,874 --> 01:18:15,739
加紧审批MEV-1型号疫苗
...of the MEV-1 vaccine...

1027
01:18:15,909 --> 01:18:19,845
当前正在美国和欧洲的5个秘密地点进行生产
...currently in production at five
secret locations in the U.S. And Europe...

1028
01:18:20,013 --> 01:18:24,677
据说首批用于人类的疫苗会在未来90天内生产出来
...saying the first doses could be available for human use within 90 days.

1029
01:18:24,851 --> 01:18:27,376
世界卫生组织估计这将花费将近1年的时间
The WHO estimates that it could take nearly a year...

1030
01:18:27,554 --> 01:18:30,887
来制造和分发出去基本需求数量的的疫苗
...to manufacture and distribute the 
necessary amount of the vaccine...

1031
01:18:31,058 --> 01:18:33,026
以此抑制病毒的持续传播
...to stop the spread of the virus...

1032
01:18:33,193 --> 01:18:37,152
目前该病毒在全球范围内已经夺去了超过260万人的生命
...which so far has taken over 26 million lives worldwide.

1033
01:18:37,330 --> 01:18:41,164
在实验室加紧生产救命药物的同时
But as labs work around the clock to 
produce the life-saving formula...

1034
01:18:41,334 --> 01:18:44,633
哪些人应该首先得到救治?
Who gets it first?

1035
01:18:46,118 --> 01:18:48,384
疾病爆发第131天

1036
01:18:55,749 --> 01:18:57,649
- 别碰我  - 东西在哪儿?
- Don't touch me. - Where is it?

1037
01:18:57,951 --> 01:19:00,852
- 我们没有  
- 胡说  他在这儿工作  他肯定是最先得到的
- We don't have it.
- Bullshit. He works there. He gets it first.

1038
01:19:01,021 --> 01:19:02,989
我们确实没有  我们必须等到
We don't have it. We have to wait...

1039
01:19:32,052 --> 01:19:34,020
- 奥布里? - 埃利斯?
- Aubrey? - Ellis?

1040
01:19:34,187 --> 01:19:35,882
你在哪儿
Where are you?

1041
01:19:36,523 --> 01:19:40,084
被抢劫是因为他们看到你上了电视新闻节目 
而且知道了发生的事情
It's because they saw you on the news 
and they heard about what happened.

1042
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:42,251
- 你还好吗  - 他们知道你的住处
- You all right?  - They knew where you worked.

1043
01:19:42,429 --> 01:19:43,953
他们等到你离家后才行动
They waited for you to leave.

1044
01:19:45,732 --> 01:19:49,532
- 起来坐这儿  让我看看你
- 我曾试过阻止他们
- Get up here. Come on. Let me look at you.
- I tried to stop them.

1045
01:19:49,703 --> 01:19:51,500
我试过
I tried.

1046
01:19:52,105 --> 01:19:56,838
- 他们碰你了没?  他们看起来像是染病了的吗?
- 他们戴了面具和手套  埃利斯
- Did they touch you? Did they look sick?
They had masks on, Ellis, and gloves.

1047
01:19:57,010 --> 01:20:01,106
别告诉我你…  我们明天才能领到疫苗
Don't tell me that...
Aubrey, we get the vaccine tomorrow.

1048
01:20:01,281 --> 01:20:04,045
你要相信我  埃利斯
You have to trust me, Ellis.

1049
01:20:04,217 --> 01:20:06,412
他们真的没有碰我
They didn't touch me.

1050
01:20:07,087 --> 01:20:10,784
在1918年西班牙流感爆发以后  有些人变得富有
After the Spanish flu in 1918, you know, people got rich.

1051
01:20:10,957 --> 01:20:14,654
生产维克斯达姆膏和来苏水(一种消毒剂)的人  靠它发财了
The Vicks VapoRub people, the Lysol people, look it up.

1052
01:20:14,828 --> 01:20:18,389
一个人死了  另一人靠卖棺材挣钱
One man dies, another man makes money off his coffin.

1053
01:20:18,565 --> 01:20:21,864
一个国家捕杀了所有的鸡  
然后猪牛羊肉等成为了高需求的东西
One country culls all their chickens,
red meat goes into higher demand.

1054
01:20:22,035 --> 01:20:23,935
我又不是第一个靠这种事情赚钱的人
I'm not the first person to make money...

1055
01:20:24,104 --> 01:20:27,699
再说我们的免疫系统也在不断变化
..off the fact that our immune system is a work in progress.

1056
01:20:27,874 --> 01:20:30,866
医药行业每个季度都会做一次
The pharmaceutical industry do it every quarter.

1057
01:20:31,044 --> 01:20:33,808
我可不认为有人愿意错过机遇  艾伦
I don't think anyone is immune to opportunity, Alan.

1058
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:37,313
没有任何研究表明说能证明连翘对这个病毒有疗效
It's just that studies show
that there is no proof that forsythia works.

1059
01:20:37,484 --> 01:20:39,076
谁在进行研究工作?
Who conducted the studies?

1060
01:20:39,252 --> 01:20:42,653
"有效的定义"是什么?  抵御哪种类型的病毒?
What defines "works"? Against what strain of the virus?

1061
01:20:42,822 --> 01:20:45,450
你还记得上次我们会面时谈论的那些研究吗
Did you know about the studies
when we met the last time?

1062
01:20:45,625 --> 01:20:47,092
我们可能卷入很大的麻烦
We can get in a lot of trouble...

1063
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:51,321
你真的以为这个疾控中心的Hextall医生
是穿白大褂的耶稣吗?
Do you really think this Dr. Hextall 
CDC person is Jesus in a lab coat?

1064
01:20:51,498 --> 01:20:53,625
是政府赶着要试验
The government rushed the trials.

1065
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:56,860
律师们让这些制药公司免于受罚
The lawyers indemnified the drug companies.

1066
01:20:57,037 --> 01:21:01,974
这些药物可能会在10年后引起自闭症或嗜睡症
Maybe it causes autism or narcolepsy
or cancer 10 years from now.

1067
01:21:02,142 --> 01:21:04,474
谁知道呢?
Who knows?

1068
01:21:04,644 --> 01:21:05,941
你… 这个…
You... The...

1069
01:21:06,112 --> 01:21:10,105
猪流感疫苗于1976年爆发后遗症  让许多人送命
The swine flu vaccine killed people back in 1976.

1070
01:21:10,283 --> 01:21:11,307
神经性疾病
Nerve disease.

1071
01:21:11,484 --> 01:21:14,078
所以我们现在全都是小豚鼠
So we're all guinea pigs, starting from today.

1072
01:21:14,254 --> 01:21:19,590
等等  他们就如制作电影的人
在一开始就会声明有哪些副作用
Just wait, they'll start listing side effects
like the credits at the end of a movie.

1073
01:21:19,759 --> 01:21:23,195
人们信任你  艾伦  如果你告诉他们不要服药
People trust you, Alan. If you tell them not to take it...

1074
01:21:23,363 --> 01:21:25,160
没错
That's right.

1075
01:21:25,332 --> 01:21:28,995
他们信任我  这1千2百万访问者们
They trust me. All 12 million unique visitors.

1076
01:21:29,169 --> 01:21:31,433
我是一个值得信任在媒体前发表言论的人
I'm a trusted man stepping up to a microphone...

1077
01:21:31,605 --> 01:21:34,506
在大量的民众面前
...in front of a very large crowd.

1078
01:21:34,674 --> 01:21:37,700
我就是这种人  这就是名人效应
That's who I am. That's the brand.

1079
01:21:37,877 --> 01:21:40,368
我说的一切全是合理的
I say the right thing, nobody shows up for their shot.

1080
01:21:40,547 --> 01:21:42,811
也许他们宁愿相信连翘是有作用的
Maybe they'd rather roll the dice with forsythia.

1081
01:21:44,351 --> 01:21:45,716
我可以办到
I can make that happen.

1082
01:21:45,885 --> 01:21:49,013
我只是想知道我在合适的位置来做这些事情
I just wanna know I'm in the best position possible when I do.

1083
01:21:49,189 --> 01:21:51,316
什么意思  说真的
What does that mean, exactly?

1084
01:21:52,592 --> 01:21:55,959
假如我站在十字路口  我想知道…
If I'm gonna step into the crosshairs,
I wanna know what's in...

1085
01:21:59,332 --> 01:22:01,323
- 他是和你一起的吗  - 什么  你说谁?
- Is he with you?  - What? Who?

1086
01:22:01,501 --> 01:22:03,526
你是不是带了窃听设备?
Are you wearing a wire?

1087
01:22:05,472 --> 01:22:08,999
艾伦  我没得选择  他们看到了你博客
Alan, I didn't have a choice. they've seen your blog.

1088
01:22:09,576 --> 01:22:10,668
抓住他
Get him.

1089
01:22:15,649 --> 01:22:19,050
- 看你跑得了多远  -  为什么抓我  告诉我
- Far enough, far enough.
- For what? Tell me, for what?

1090
01:22:19,219 --> 01:22:22,848
涉嫌证券欺诈  合谋  过失杀人
Securities fraud, conspiracy, and most likely manslaughter.

1091
01:22:23,023 --> 01:22:26,049
- 它把我治好了  连翘治愈了我
- 我们会查明白的  艾伦
- It cured me. Forsythia cured me.
- We'll see, Alan.

1092
01:22:26,626 --> 01:22:28,560
这明显是诱捕行为
This is entrapment.

1093
01:22:28,728 --> 01:22:32,960
你不能抽我的血液  
你不能这么做,那是我的私人财产
You can't take my blood.
You can't, that's my property.

1094
01:22:40,173 --> 01:22:43,836
我们也许永远也不知道病毒的起源地
We may never know where this disease came from.

1095
01:22:44,010 --> 01:22:46,774
但是我们知道这个疫苗
But we do know that this vaccine is the result...

1096
01:22:46,946 --> 01:22:51,747
是很多人用毅力和勇气换来的
...of the courage and perseverance of a remarkable few.

1097
01:22:52,919 --> 01:22:57,049
现在我们开始摇号  约翰
We shall now begin the drawing. John.

1098
01:23:00,427 --> 01:23:03,794
首批接受MEV-1疫苗接种的是…
The first MEV-1 vaccination...

1099
01:23:03,963 --> 01:23:07,922
…出生日期为3月10日的人群
...are those people born on March 10th.

1100
01:23:08,101 --> 01:23:09,125
3月10日
March 10th.

1101
01:23:09,302 --> 01:23:14,103
必须提醒大家在排队的时候  相互之间要
We remind all of you to stay 10 feet apart from each other...

1102
01:23:14,274 --> 01:23:16,208
保持10步的距离
...while on line.

1103
01:23:25,318 --> 01:23:26,580
你不是该在下面的吗
Shouldn't you be downstairs?

1104
01:23:26,753 --> 01:23:29,187
我在跟踪疫苗批号
I'm tracking vaccine batch numbers.

1105
01:23:29,356 --> 01:23:31,756
这个是你眼下必须做的工作吗
This is what you have to be doing right this minute?

1106
01:23:31,925 --> 01:23:34,826
这是我眼下很想做的事情
This is what I want to do right this minute.

1107
01:23:36,496 --> 01:23:38,293
放松下  艾丽
Take a bow, Ally.

1108
01:23:38,465 --> 01:23:39,830
大家已经失去了很多
People have for a lot less.

1109
01:23:39,999 --> 01:23:42,661
你给自己打针算不上什么难事
It's not that hard to give yourself an injection.

1110
01:23:42,836 --> 01:23:47,068
米尔丝医生  我爸爸他们怎么样了? 还有你
  What about Mears or my father or you?

1111
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:51,108
等你在国会面前被带走的时候我能放松下?
I'm gonna take a bow 
while you get hauled in front of Congress?

1112
01:23:51,277 --> 01:23:54,212
他们问起来我该怎么说
What do I say when they ask about that?

1113
01:23:55,014 --> 01:23:57,812
你告诉他们我跟一个自己心爱的人说了
她又告诉另外一个心爱的人
You tell them that I told a loved one
who told a loved one...

1114
01:23:57,984 --> 01:23:59,281
而且我下次还会这么做
...and that I'd do it again.

1115
01:23:59,452 --> 01:24:03,013
艾丽   你拯救了上百万的生命
Ally, you have saved millions of lives.

1116
01:24:03,189 --> 01:24:05,453
这是一个伟大的故事  也可能变为现实
That's a great story. It also happens to be true.

1117
01:24:05,625 --> 01:24:07,286
现在  你多久能说一次?
Now, how often can you say that?

1118
01:24:10,130 --> 01:24:13,395
下一批接受MEV-1疫苗接种的市民是…
The next citizens to receive the MEV-1 vaccination...

1119
01:24:13,566 --> 01:24:16,399
…是出生日期为…
...are those born on the date...

1120
01:24:17,003 --> 01:24:19,471
是哪天?  1月11日
What is that? January 11th.

1121
01:24:19,639 --> 01:24:23,973
好吧  已经叫到第114批了
Okay. All right, 144.

1122
01:24:24,677 --> 01:24:27,475
那个…  那还有  呃  200…
That's... Ahem. There's still, uh, 200...

1123
01:24:27,647 --> 01:24:30,946
还有超过200个出生日期没叫到呢 
所以还是有希望的
More than 200 birthdays, hon,
that haven't been called, so that's good.

1124
01:24:31,117 --> 01:24:32,584
是个好数字
That's a good number.

1125
01:24:33,119 --> 01:24:35,519
- 如果他们的疫苗用完了呢? - 不会的
- What if they run out?
- They're not gonna run out.

1126
01:24:35,688 --> 01:24:38,919
他们一定会满足我们的需求  他们已经承诺过
They have enough to keep up with demand.
They said that already.

1127
01:24:39,092 --> 01:24:42,220
也许我和你一样是免疫的  我不需要接种疫苗
Maybe I'm immune like you and I don't even need it.

1128
01:24:42,395 --> 01:24:45,125
我们不能冒这种险
That's not a chance we're gonna take.

1129
01:24:45,298 --> 01:24:49,291
相反的是我们失去了春天和夏天 
So instead we lose spring, we lose summer...

1130
01:24:49,469 --> 01:24:53,235
失去了再也不会发生的144天
...we lose another 144 days that don't happen again.

1131
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:57,737
为什么他们不发明一个阻止时间流逝的东西?
Why can't they invent a shot
that keeps time from passing?

1132
01:24:58,344 --> 01:25:01,541
一切都会恢复正常的  乔瑞
It's gonna start getting normal again, Jory.

1133
01:25:39,853 --> 01:25:44,187
这个怎么称呼  "fish" 用中文怎么说
How do you call this, "fish," in Chinese?

1134
01:25:44,791 --> 01:25:46,816
这是鱼
This is yú.

1135
01:25:48,962 --> 01:25:52,090
- 太漂亮了  - 谢谢
- This is beautiful. - Thank you.

1136
01:25:52,265 --> 01:25:55,962
时间到了  我们必须走了  他们的飞机到了
It's time. We have to run. He just landed.

1137
01:25:56,569 --> 01:25:59,037
你继续画画…
I want you to keep drawing...

1138
01:25:59,205 --> 01:26:03,642
Assand会来继续上这堂课的  好吗
...and Assand will come and finish the class, all right?

1139
01:26:03,810 --> 01:26:05,368
再见
I'll see you soon.

1140
01:26:05,545 --> 01:26:07,945
- 再见  - 再见
- See you.  - See you.

1141
01:26:18,358 --> 01:26:21,452
3号高速公路旁的荃湾坟场(位于香港九龙)
Tsuen Wan Cemetery off the Number 3 Expressway.

1142
01:26:21,628 --> 01:26:25,064
离这里不远  只需要15分钟路程
It's close to where you are now. In 15 minutes.

1143
01:26:25,231 --> 01:26:29,327
100份的剂量  不能有政府部门的人或警察
One hundred doses. Nobody from the ministry, no police.

1144
01:26:29,502 --> 01:26:34,201
如果我们看到有其他车辆  你就再也见不到她了
If we see anybody else, any other vehicles, 
you'll never see her again.

1145
01:26:37,410 --> 01:26:38,934
喂
Yes?

1146
01:26:39,812 --> 01:26:43,145
是的  我没事  按照他们的要求做
Yes, I'm fine. Please give them what they ask.

1147
01:26:43,316 --> 01:26:45,409
我只是想回家
I just wanna go home.

1148
01:26:47,387 --> 01:26:51,551
只要我们得到了疫苗 
就会告诉你到哪儿去找她
Once we have the vaccine,
we'll tell you where to find her.

1149
01:27:39,172 --> 01:27:42,801
- 是法国还是美国的?
- 从法国弄的不够
- Is it French or American?
- We could not get enough from the French.

1150
01:27:42,976 --> 01:27:45,672
疫苗是在这里生产的  都是同样的配方
It's been made here. The same formula, though.

1151
01:27:46,579 --> 01:27:49,104
我保证是有效的
It is effective, I promise.

1152
01:27:49,983 --> 01:27:51,507
全在这儿  小心点
There, be careful.

1153
01:28:02,428 --> 01:28:04,623
等等  她在哪儿?
Wait, where is she?

1154
01:28:10,203 --> 01:28:14,037
- 我们不确定这是不是真的
- 但我们没有其他选择
- We don't know what it is.
- Well, we have no choice.

1155
01:28:16,242 --> 01:28:17,436
Orantes医生在哪?
Where is Dr. Orantes?

1156
01:28:31,691 --> 01:28:34,353
等等   我们说好的可不是这样
Now, wait, this is not what we agreed on.

1157
01:28:43,469 --> 01:28:45,198
你还好吗
Are you okay?

1158
01:28:48,708 --> 01:28:50,767
没事  我很好
Yes, I'm fine.

1159
01:28:50,943 --> 01:28:52,638
我没事
I'm good.

1160
01:29:09,929 --> 01:29:12,056
噢  我差点忘了
Oh, I almost forgot.

1161
01:29:15,735 --> 01:29:17,794
- 这是什么  - 给你的疫苗
- What's that? - Your vaccine.

1162
01:29:17,970 --> 01:29:20,564
刚给你注射的是安慰剂
The one you took was a placebo.

1163
01:29:21,207 --> 01:29:22,640
什么
What?

1164
01:29:23,743 --> 01:29:27,679
世上太多绑架了   不只是这里才会发生
There have been many abductions, not just here.

1165
01:29:27,847 --> 01:29:29,678
俄国 墨西哥  到处都有
In Russia, Mexico, all over.

01:29:29,849 --> 01:29:34,411
政府官员 科学家  或者西方的大富豪们
Government officials, scientists,
or Westerners with great wealth.

1167
01:29:34,587 --> 01:29:37,522
很多犯有组织犯罪或革命性组织
Mostly perpetrated by organized 
crime or revolutionary groups...

1168
01:29:37,690 --> 01:29:39,123
试图借药品敲诈
...trying to extort medicines.

1169
01:29:39,292 --> 01:29:42,625
中国人不和绑匪谈判  这不是我们能决定的
The Chinese don't negotiate
with kidnappers. It wasn't up to us.

1170
01:29:42,795 --> 01:29:45,958
我们的供给本来就像其他人一样非常有限
We've got a limited supply, just like everyone else.

1171
01:29:46,132 --> 01:29:48,225
莉奥诺拉
Leo... Leonora.

1172
01:29:48,701 --> 01:29:50,635
你去哪儿?
Where are you going?

1173
01:30:22,135 --> 01:30:25,161
血液检测结果出来了,克鲁・姆维德先生
Blood results came back, Mr. Krumwiede.

1174
01:30:25,338 --> 01:30:30,275
你身体里根本没有病毒  根本没有抗体  你撒谎了
You never had the virus.
You have no antibodies. You lied.

1175
01:30:30,443 --> 01:30:32,934
你们的实验室当然会这么说了
Of course that's what your labs say.

1176
01:30:33,112 --> 01:30:35,342
连翘有疗效也是谎言
Forsythia is a lie.

1177
01:30:35,515 --> 01:30:38,712
这是个谎言  因为你浪费了4百50万美元
It's a lie, and you made $4.5 million for telling it.

1178
01:30:38,885 --> 01:30:40,750
你会把这个放到博客上去吗
You wanna blog about that?

1179
01:30:42,822 --> 01:30:47,282
你得消失一段时间了  克鲁・姆维德先生  还有你的发财梦
You are going to go away, Mr. Krumwiede, 
and so is all your money.

1180
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:51,021
我甚至不敢想象所有的民事诉讼人士将和你对簿公堂
I can't even imagine all the civil suits
people are gonna file against you...

1181
01:30:51,197 --> 01:30:53,062
我的想象力一直不错
...and I have a pretty good imagination.

1182
01:30:53,232 --> 01:30:55,496
现在你要告诉人们不要接种疫苗
Now you wanna tell people not to get vaccinated...

1183
01:30:55,668 --> 01:30:58,102
但接种疫苗是他们能得到的最好的机会
...when that's the best chance  they've got.

1184
01:30:59,105 --> 01:31:01,335
真想把你送进监狱
If I could throw your computer in jail, I would.

1185
01:31:05,711 --> 01:31:07,269
他被保释了
Made bail.

1186
01:31:12,218 --> 01:31:14,152
我们谈完了吗
Are we done here?

1187
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:17,312
很显然  还有像你一样疯狂的一千二百万民众
Evidently, there are 12 million other people as crazy as you are.

1188
01:31:17,490 --> 01:31:19,651
你成功保释了  恭喜你
You made bail. Congratulations.

1189
01:31:30,169 --> 01:31:34,299
米切尔医生和你妻子的  替我恭喜下奥布里
Cheever and wife. Congratulate Aubrey for me.

1190
01:31:34,473 --> 01:31:37,965
我本该和你握手  但是我不想作个坏的榜样
I'd shake your hand, but I don't wanna set a bad example.

1191
01:31:38,244 --> 01:31:42,578
呃  等大家可以聚集在一起的时候会有个公务接待的
Um, we're gonna have an official reception
when we can get everybody in one place...

1192
01:31:42,748 --> 01:31:44,943
真的很希望你能和我们在一起
...and we really hope you can be with us.

1193
01:31:45,117 --> 01:31:48,052
当然  你准备好注射了吗?  我的已经注射了
Sure. So are you ready for yours? I've got mine.

1194
01:31:48,221 --> 01:31:51,019
不了  我想她回希望我们能一起做这个
No, I think she's gonna wanna do these together.

1195
01:31:51,190 --> 01:31:54,387
- 她准备了一些香槟庆祝  - 嗯
- I know she sprang for some champagne. - Hm.

1196
01:31:55,494 --> 01:32:00,898
他们已经安排好了听证会  
到时候我们会出庭作证的
They have scheduled the hearings.
We'll both be expected to testify.

1197
01:32:01,067 --> 01:32:02,534
谢谢
Right.

1198
01:32:03,836 --> 01:32:05,360
祝你好运
Good luck.

1199
01:32:28,194 --> 01:32:30,162
头向后仰  安东尼
Head back, Anthony.

1200
01:32:32,598 --> 01:32:33,622
可以了
There you go.

1201
01:32:40,606 --> 01:32:41,698
很好
Good job.

1202
01:32:41,874 --> 01:32:47,335
我不能给他手链  但至少你知道他是安全的
I can't give him the bracelet,
but at least you know he'll be safe.

1203
01:32:47,513 --> 01:32:50,607
好的  耐心等待7个月
Yeah, beats waiting another seven months.

1204
01:32:52,451 --> 01:32:54,316
好了  你想说点什么?

1206
01:32:59,525 --> 01:33:01,891
你知道握手的来历吗?
You know where this comes from, shaking hands?

1207
01:33:02,061 --> 01:33:03,085
不知道
No.

1208
01:33:03,262 --> 01:33:07,631
古时候 人们用和陌生人握手的方式
来表明他身上没携带武器
It was a way of showing a stranger you
weren't carrying a weapon in the old days.

1209
01:33:08,401 --> 01:33:12,132
- 好了  去做你的功课吧  - 好的

1210
01:33:13,272 --> 01:33:14,796
好了
Yeah.

1211
01:33:14,974 --> 01:33:18,671
通过展示你空的双手来表明你没有危险
You offered your empty right hand
to show that you meant no harm.

1212
01:33:18,844 --> 01:33:22,439
- 噢  我以前不知道
- 我希望病毒会知道
- Oh, I didn't know that.
- I wonder if the virus does.

1213
01:33:23,082 --> 01:33:26,677
嗯  米切尔医生  非常感谢
Well, Dr. Cheever, thanks.

1214
01:33:30,756 --> 01:33:32,587
保重  罗杰
Take care, Roger.

1215
01:33:32,758 --> 01:33:34,419
你也一样
You too.

1216
01:33:51,777 --> 01:33:54,109
你不会因为这个惹上麻烦吧?
You're not gonna get in trouble for this, are you?

1217
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:55,872
你能安静下吗
Will you be quiet?

1218
01:33:56,048 --> 01:33:58,516
我的号码是287  埃利斯
My number is 287, Ellis.

1219
01:33:58,684 --> 01:34:01,312
如果我们没有结婚  现在必须得等将近1年
If we weren't married,
I'd have to wait almost a year.

1220
01:34:01,487 --> 01:34:03,580
看来我们已经结婚了是件好事
Then it's a good thing we're married.

1221
01:34:03,856 --> 01:34:04,880
头往后仰
Hold your head back.

1222
01:34:05,057 --> 01:34:07,582
我只是不想他们再找你的麻烦
I don't wanna give them another reason to go after you.

1223
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:10,490
你能安静会儿  把头往后仰点吗?
Will you please be quiet and hold your head back?

1224
01:34:12,932 --> 01:34:13,956
嗯  好了
Okay, go.

1225
01:34:15,334 --> 01:34:16,858
- 太好了  - 嗯
- Good.  - Mm.

1226
01:34:17,803 --> 01:34:20,795
还有这边
And go.

1227
01:34:20,973 --> 01:34:21,997
很好
Good.

1228
01:34:24,143 --> 01:34:25,770
好了
All right.

1229
01:34:26,358 --> 01:34:29,171
就如你所说…
Like you said, baby...

1230
01:34:29,248 --> 01:34:34,510
照顾好所有身边的人
...just taking care of everybody that's in my lifeboat.

1231
01:34:34,901 --> 01:34:38,584
