1
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:11,270
Everyone has an angel.

2
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:14,936
A guardian who watches over us.

3
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:18,565
We can't know what form they'll take.

4
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,447
One day, old man.

5
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:25,697
Next day, little girl.

6
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:30,038
But don't let appearances fool you.

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,329
They can be as fierce as any dragon.

8
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:37,625
Yet they're not here to Fight our battles...

9
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,837
...but to whisper from our heart...

10
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,377
...reminding that it's us.

11
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:48,800
It's every one of us who holds the power over the worlds we create.

12
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:13,370
No!

13
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,496
No.

14
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,568
We can deny our angels exist...

15
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,609
...convince ourselves they can't be real.

16
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,741
But they show up anyway.

17
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,997
At strange places.

18
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,578
And at strange times.

19
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:28,583
They can speak through any character we can imagine.

20
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,373
They'll shout through demons if they have to...

21
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,758
...daring us...

22
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,215
...challenging us to Fight.

23
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:35,647
Female. Age 20.

24
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,810
- You're the father?       - Stepfather.

25
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,647
That's right. We talked on the phone.

26
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,326
Okay, come with me.

27
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,707
We're gonna take her into the theater.

28
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:34,083
Dr. Gorski's gonna want to take a look at her. She likes to see all the new girls.

29
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,087
Don't worry, Dad. Everything's gonna be fine.

30
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,219
I've got everything under control around here.

31
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,051
Okay? Come on. Follow me.

32
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:01,239
So this is what we call the theater.

33
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,163
Liar!

34
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,128
Oh, girls. Yes, go, go.

35
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,963
Hey. Come here.

36
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,969
Girls. Behave.

37
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,506
- Break it up. Break it up.       - Will you stop them?

38
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,594
Lynn.

39
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,473
Amy.

40
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,103
Sit down.

41
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,309
Sit.

42
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:39,653
Anyway. So the girls use this place to be social.

43
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:44,237
Dr. Gorski, she uses it to help them deal with their issues.

44
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,702
Polish therapy.

45
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:52,700
It's quite a show, watching them act out who touched them or beat them.

46
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,289
Dr. Gorski seems to think it helps. I'm not so sure.

47
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:58,296
But whether it does or doesn't won't matter much to you.

48
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,049
Once we take care of a little bit of business...

49
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,756
- ...there won't be any of that for this one.       - Good.

50
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:07,468
She'll be in paradise, if you know what I mean.

51
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:13,137
And all of your troubles will be over.

52
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:18,525
Now, I know we said 1400 on the phone ....

53
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,687
I'm taking a really big risk here...

54
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:25,482
...so it's gonna have to be 2 grand even.

55
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,322
What the hell are you talking about? We had a deal.

56
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:33,491
Listen, Father, I'm not gonna tell you what to do.

57
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,034
Clearly you're a man that can take care of himself.

58
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:40,752
I don't know what you did to this girl. And, frankly, I don't wanna know.

59
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:44,009
What are you gonna tell the detectives when they come around?

60
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,340
They're gonna love her side of the story.

61
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:47,925
- Yeah.       - Okay.

62
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,928
I'm going to start your music.

63
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,226
You are safe.

64
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,102
It's all safe.

65
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,227
Now relax.

66
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,853
And just let go.

67
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,738
Now, here's the other thing:

68
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:07,775
I don't have a doctor on staff who does lobotomies.

69
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,364
- What?       - But...

70
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:14,031
...there happens to be one scheduled to come in in five days.

71
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:17,121
So I'll just forge her signature. I've done it a dozen times.

72
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,785
it's like we talk about.

73
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,209
You control this world.

74
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,049
I told the police she lost her mind when her mother died.

75
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,381
The truth is a little more complicated.

76
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,717
Let the pain go.

77
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,470
Let the hurt go.

78
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,802
Let the guilt go.

79
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:39,189
What you're imagining right now...

80
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,941
...that world you control?

81
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,194
That place can be as real as any pain.

82
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,355
I don't want her to remember a thing.

83
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:52,494
Don't worry, she won't even remember her name when I'm done with her.

84
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:26,829
Stop.

85
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,549
Get that thing away from me.

86
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:30,754
Get it away from me.

87
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:32,798
Where is my mind?

88
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,305
And shut off that damn music.

89
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,925
Undo these straps.

90
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,936
Don't forget my ankles.

91
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,019
Hurry.

92
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,977
Is there a problem, Sweet Pea?

93
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,821
This is a joke, right?

94
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,446
Don't you get the point of this?

95
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,361
It's to turn people on.

96
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,073
I get the sexy little schoolgirl.

97
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:04,960
I even get the helpless mental patient, right? That can be hot.

98
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,711
But what is this?

99
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,796
Lobotomized vegetable?

100
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:14,298
How about something a little more commercial, for God's sakes?

101
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,760
Sweet Pea, could you come here, please?

102
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,977
You gotta help me.

103
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,688
I'm the star of the show, remember?

104
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,979
I'll figure something out.

105
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,775
All right, ladies. Wrap it up.

106
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,691
Sweet Pea, I want you to meet somebody. This...

107
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:37,950
Don't tell me.

108
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:42,576
The priest brought you here from the orphanage to lose your virginity, right?

109
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,868
Oh, let me rephrase that.

110
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,081
To sell it.

111
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,245
Heh, heh, heh. Yeah, that's right.

112
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,585
How original.

113
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,292
The High Roller is coming for her in five days.

114
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,963
He's gonna, you know, just do a little flower picking.

115
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,344
And he's gonna pay a lot of money for that.

116
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,883
Mm. Luck you.

117
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,764
Can you do me a favor, honey?

118
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:07,772
Can you show this little baby doll around, give her a tour of the establishment?

119
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,777
Blue, you saw the show, okay? I don't have the time.

120
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,441
Let my sister take her.

121
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,107
Rocket.

122
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,123
Show her around, will you, sis?

123
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,871
All right, come on. Let's go.

124
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,999
Don't worry, I don't bite very hard.

125
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,134
Goodbye, my dear.

126
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:39,553
Jesus!

127
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,339
You'll get what you deserve when the High Roller comes!

128
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:43,224
- Calm down.       - I will not calm down.

129
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:46,057
- You see what she did? I hope you rot!       - I did. I'm sorry.

130
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,891
This way.

131
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:53,647
You're gonna be okay. It just takes e little while to get used to.

132
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:57,189
So how'd you become an orphan?

133
00:14:57,355 --> 00:15:00,825
Oh, I get it. It's complicated, right?

134
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:04,032
Well, we all have our stories in here. Mine's...

135
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,287
...complicated

136
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,667
These are the rooms where we take the clients.

137
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:13,672
There's fresh towels in all the bathrooms and...

138
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,044
Turn that on.

139
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,261
Blue owns the club.

140
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,268
And we, my dear, heh...

141
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:31,565
...are the main attractions. Ta-da.

142
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,475
The club's a front for his business.

143
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:38,192
Guns, gambling, medications, special favors.

144
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,486
He brings in his clients, and we gotta make them feel, you know...

145
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,244
...special.

146
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,862
New girl.

147
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,408
This is our backstage.

148
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:56,214
It's just for us, so don't bring any clients back here, okay? Or Blue's gonna get pissed.

149
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,918
Uh, cleaning closet.

150
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:04,464
You'll find all the mops, brooms, disinfectants.

151
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,383
New girls get cleaning duties.

152
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,641
I don't make the rules.

153
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:14,808
And if you don't do what you're told, Blue locks us in here...

154
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,727
...until we become a bit more cooperative.

155
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,322
Don't worry. it's not gonna happen to you.

156
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,240
This is the kitchen.

157
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,537
We all work in here.

158
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,623
Time for rehearsal.

159
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:40,083
She looked nice. She looked stuck-up to me.

160
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,092
No. She's scared.

161
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,343
I feel sorry for her.

162
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,722
Amber, you feel sorry for everyone.

163
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,760
Do you remember when you first got here? Nobody felt sorry for you.

164
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,554
Well, don't get too attached to her, okay?

165
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,438
Blue's saving her for the High Roller.

166
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,604
She's no virgin.

167
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:03,777
Babydoll, that's Amber, Blondie, and you've met my sister, Sweet Pea.

168
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,193
- Watch yourself.       - Come on, just give her a break.

169
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,532
Yeah, she hasn't done anything to you guys.

170
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,321
You best friends now?

171
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,741
Will you just let me finish my tour, please?

172
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,544
Thank you.

173
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,790
Everybody gets a dance, a routine.

174
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:24,507
We practice, practice, practice, and the men come and watch us perform.

175
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:27,673
And if they like what they see ....

176
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:32,394
Well, you'll see tonight.

177
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,224
Good evening, gentlemen.

178
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,190
We've got a great night in store for you.

179
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,817
I see a lot of new faces out there.

180
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,823
As well as some familiar ones.

181
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,734
So I'm not gonna yammer on too long.

182
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,450
I want you all to sit back, enjoy the service...

183
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,410
...the scenery.

184
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,667
But most of all, enjoy the show.

185
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,665
Hit it.

186
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,926
Ooh. Au right.

187
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,727
it ain't no big thing

188
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,895
To wait for the bell to ring

189
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,103
It ain't no big thing

190
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:27,573
The toll of the bell

191
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:33,113
Aggravated, spare for days

192
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:36,783
I troll downtown The red light place

193
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:40,745
Jump up, bubble up What's in store

194
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:44,837
Love is the drug And I need to score

195
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:48,386
Showing out, showing out, Hit and run

196
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,215
Boy meets girl Well, the beat goes on

197
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:56,227
Stitched up tight I can't shake free

198
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,431
Because love is the drug for me

199
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:03,188
Oh

200
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:09,233
Love is the drug

201
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:13,077
Late that night I park my car

202
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:17,286
Stake my place in the singles bar

203
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,210
Face to face, Toe to toe

204
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,964
Heart to heart as we hit the floor

205
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:28,756
Lumber up, limbo down

206
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:32,885
The locked embrace, the stumble round

207
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,799
I say go

208
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,558
And I say yes

209
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:40,430
Dim the lights, you can guess the rest

210
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,275
Oh

211
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,104
Love is the drug

212
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,691
Oh

213
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,866
Love is the drug

214
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:59,407
Oh

215
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:05,289
Love is Love is the drug

216
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,507
Love is the drug for me

217
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,578
Oh, catch that buzz

218
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:45,336
Because love is the drug I'm thinking of

219
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,793
Oh

220
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:51,050
Can't you see Love is the drug

221
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,753
Got a hook in me

222
00:20:53,919 --> 00:21:01,178
Oh, catch that buzz Because love is the drug that I'm thinking of

223
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:08,648
Oh, can't you see Love is the drug for me

224
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:16,446
Ain't no big thing Yeah, no big thing

225
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,034
Whoo!

226
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:23,120
Can't you see Love is the drug for me

227
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:27,712
Oh

228
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:31,374
Love is the drug

229
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,511
Oh

230
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,261
Love is, love is

231
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:45,722
Love is the drug

232
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,275
Drug, drug. The drug is love.

233
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,267
Give me that.

234
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:03,196
Somebody! Help me!

235
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,371
Shh.

236
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,719
Let her go, pig.

237
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:32,480
I didn't mean nothing.

238
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:35,391
Just having a little fun.

239
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,248
Are you okay?

240
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,330
Yeah. Let's just go.

241
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,251
We don't wanna be late.

242
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:03,590
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

243
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:07,928
Two, two, three, four, arms, six, seven, eight. Stop.

244
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:10,388
Stop.

245
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,603
Where are you right now?

246
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:16,224
Are you with us or not?

247
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,109
Sweet Pea, take break.

248
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,062
Yeah.

249
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:29,912
Babydoll.

250
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,619
Come over here.

251
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,492
Come, come.

252
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,798
Let me look at you.

253
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:48,965
Hm.

254
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,805
You seem fit enough.

255
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,355
I'm going to play you some music, okay?

256
00:25:56,513 --> 00:26:00,893
I want you to just relax. Feel the music.

257
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:04,481
Open your heart to it. Let it in.

258
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,068
And when you are ready...

259
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:08,780
...I want you to dance.

260
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:42,606
If you do not dance, you have no purpose.

261
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:47,820
And we don't keep things here that have no purpose.

262
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:53,363
You see, your fight for survival starts right now.

263
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:57,033
You don't want to be judged? You won't be.

264
00:26:57,199 --> 00:27:00,920
You don't think you're strong enough? You are.

265
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:04,962
You're afraid. Don't be.

266
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:08,094
You have all the weapons you need.

267
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:09,595
Now fight.

268
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,177
Again.

269
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,416
Stand up

270
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:51,004
You've got to manage

271
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,240
Hello?

272
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,238
- Excuse me, could you help me? I'm...       - Shoes.

273
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:02,874
I'm sorry?

274
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:04,956
Your shoes.

275
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:07,955
You're tracking snow everywhere.

276
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:11,045
Oh, I'm sorry. Should I take them off?

277
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,801
That time has passed.

278
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:16,012
What can I do for you?

279
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,303
Nothing. I just...

280
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:21,059
Let me ask it another way:

281
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,762
What are you looking for?

282
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:25,522
A way out, I guess.

283
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:26,769
You guess?

284
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,359
No, I...

285
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,021
I know.

286
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,107
I need to get out of here.

287
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,276
Freedom.

288
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,864
That wasn't so hard, was it?

289
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:42,699
I'm going to help you to be free.

290
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,081
What do I have to do?

291
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,622
These are your weapons.

292
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:57,012
When you take them, you begin your journey.

293
00:29:57,838 --> 00:30:00,091
Your journey to freedom.

294
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:17,407
You will need five items for this journey.

295
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,864
The first is a map.

296
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:22,951
Then fire, a knife and a key.

297
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,657
You said five things.

298
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,498
The fifth thing is a mystery.

299
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:32,123
It is the reason. It is the goal.

300
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:37,177
It will be a deep sacrifice and a perfect victory.

301
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:44,677
Only you can find it.

302
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:46,929
And if you do...

303
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:50,770
...it will set you free.

304
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,731
Oh, and one more thing:

305
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,823
Defend yourself.

306
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,001
What was that?

307
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,963
Seriously, you're gonna have to teach me how to dance like that.

308
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,502
That was crazy.

309
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:14,264
That was so amazing. I'm, like, shaking.

310
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:19,929
I've never seen Madame Gorski clap like that before.

311
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:21,347
Well, get over it.

312
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,015
It's nearly lights out.

313
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,399
She's not easily impressed.

314
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:29,313
She wasn't impressed. All that gyrating and moaning.

315
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:32,403
The dance should be more than just titillation.

316
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:36,615
Mine's personal. It says who I am.

317
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,072
What the heck does yours say?

318
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:41,412
It says I'm gonna escape from here.

319
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:43,626
That I'm gonna be free.

320
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:46,838
Well, send me a postcard from paradise.

321
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:51,293
Are you really gonna try to escape?

322
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,637
Yeah. Before the High Roller comes.

323
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,969
- Can I come?       - Me too.

324
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:02,013
- Yeah, of course.       - You're not going anywhere, Rocket.

325
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,680
I'm gonna do what I wanna do.

326
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:07,226
No one's ever escaped from here. You know that.

327
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:10,316
Yeah. You know, the last three girls that tried died.

328
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:13,323
And the same thing'll happen to the next fool.

329
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,483
Look, why don't you just listen to my plan?

330
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,823
Don't wanna hear your plan, okay?

331
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,952
None of us do.

332
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,636
Now, let's get ready, girls.

333
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,518
Rehearsal in 15 minutes.

334
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:07,244
We're not helping Baby.

335
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,914
- Am I clear?       - What if it's a good plan?

336
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,833
Then she can go through with it.

337
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,344
I'm not letting you get hurt.

338
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:21,383
- I kept us safe through a lot of shit.       - I know you have.

339
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:24,056
I'm not gonna get hurt.

340
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:29,066
I just can't be here anymore.

341
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:31,352
And if it is a good plan, we're both going.

342
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:33,737
No, we're not.

343
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:36,364
You're on your own.

344
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,669
Well, I've been on my own before.

345
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,675
Sure you have.

346
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:58,720
Look where that got us.

347
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:11,851
Baby saved me from the Cook the other day.

348
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,855
What?

349
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:20,530
I was working in the kitchen and he comes in behind me.

350
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:24,538
And he pushes me down and he gets on top of me...

351
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:26,869
...and I can't even move.

352
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:32,454
And there she was, just like that.

353
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:36,458
She had a knife to his throat.

354
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,256
She saved me.

355
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:08,286
The High Roller comes for me in three days.

356
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:11,376
But I'm getting out of here before he does.

357
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:15,463
So if you guys wanna come with me, this is how I plan to do it.

358
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,133
Well?

359
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,673
Okay.

360
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:30,228
If we can collect all four of these items, we can be free.

361
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:31,854
Okay.

362
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,515
- How do we use them?       - Wait up.

363
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,233
First things first.

364
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,815
How do you plan on getting these things?

365
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:42,824
Well, whoever has the item we need, we get them to watch me dance.

366
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:45,618
While we run around and pick their pockets?

367
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:48,951
- Yeah, that's right.       - But we'd be taking all the risk.

368
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,957
We'd be doing the work while you prance around with an alibi.

369
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:55,211
No. As long as I'm dancing, they won't even know you're there.

370
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,714
Okay, so the first thing we need is a map...

371
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:06,347
...to figure out where all the exits are, where the guards are located.

372
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:09,305
Blue has that in his office. it's behind his desk.

373
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,764
Right. Good.

374
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:13,889
Second thing we need is something to start a fire with...

375
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:16,399
...as a distraction for when we escape.

376
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,193
Plus, the fire should disable all the checkpoints.

377
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,154
And the third thing is a knife...

378
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,361
...in case we run into trouble.

379
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,071
The Cook.

380
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,954
- We can do it.       - Okay.

381
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:31,865
And the last thing's a key.

382
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,034
Blue wears a key around his neck.

383
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,373
What door does it open?

384
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:39,915
It's for all of them, I think. it's a master key.

385
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:42,800
This plan is crazy.

386
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,757
There's armed guards everywhere, okay?

387
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,264
And if Blue finds out, we're dead.

388
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:52,769
It's not gonna be, "Oh, sorry, Blue, we won't do it again." We'll be dead.

389
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,809
We're already dead.

390
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:03,696
- I'm in.       - So am I.

391
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,527
Me too.

392
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,321
All right.

393
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:17,335
But I'm only doing this because you guys'd get caught without me, okay?

394
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,086
And if it gets too hairy...

395
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:22,211
...if I say it's over...

396
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,091
...we stop.

397
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,797
Okay.

398
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:28,880
Okay.

399
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:32,933
I'll get the map.

400
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:41,105
I went for a walk down the railroad track.

401
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,148
Next thing you know, some...

402
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:46,440
- What do you want?       - She's dancing.

403
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:48,199
Who is dancing?

404
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:50,535
Your baby doll.

405
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:44,373
One pill makes you larger

406
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:51,053
One pill makes you larger

407
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:55,683
And one pill makes you small

408
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:11,566
Baby.

409
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,785
Baby.

410
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:18,493
He's coming. He's gonna start the briefing.

411
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:45,441
All right, here's the drill:

412
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,025
The Germans are preparing a report for the kaiser. it's a map...

413
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:52,191
...that shows troop locations and trench layouts.

414
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:55,735
Their field commander's sending the map via courier...

415
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:57,825
...back to Germany on a zeppelin today.

416
00:44:58,029 --> 00:44:59,451
How do we intercept it?

417
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:03,118
You're gonna cross no man's land, enter the enemy trenches...

418
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:06,128
...and take the map from the field commander's bunker...

419
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:08,460
...before the courier can reach the zeppelin.

420
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:10,500
Sounds like fun.

421
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:13,795
Oh, and I've arranged something special for Amber.

422
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,463
Give you some cover.

423
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:17,553
Get you out of there when you're done.

424
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:21,636
Let's go.

425
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:21,120
What do you think?

426
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,907
I like it.

427
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:43,722
German doctors and engineers...

428
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:47,184
...have worked out how to return their fallen to the front lines.

429
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:51,772
They're using steam power and clockworks to keep them moving.

430
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:56,531
So don't feel bad about killing them.

431
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,367
They're already dead.

432
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:09,828
Remember, ladies:

433
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:11,913
If you don't stand for something...

434
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,582
...you'll fall for anything.

435
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,260
Oh, and one last thing:

436
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,801
Try and work together.

437
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:33,998
Son of a...

438
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,779
Come on, guys. The bunker's this way.

439
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:50,090
- Cover!       - Rocket!

440
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:52,805
Sweet Pea! Help!

441
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:04,153
Unh. Sweet Pea!

442
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:16,638
Rocket.

443
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,981
Are you okay?

444
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:32,778
it's right here.

445
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,273
Rocket. That's enough.

446
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,600
Wow.

447
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:56,815
Very good.

448
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:58,692
- Nice work.       - Thanks.

449
00:57:58,850 --> 00:57:59,942
Very good.

450
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:05,319
Okay, this gives me an idea.

451
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:09,203
What about a private dance for the Mayor.

452
00:58:09,361 --> 00:58:10,408
What?

453
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:13,414
Nothing touchy-feely, just something to get him wound up.

454
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,246
Get him ready to spend some money.

455
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:17,537
All she has to do is do what she did just now.

456
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:22,667
That is out of the question. She is not ready. It is too raw.

457
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:24,380
Did you just say she's not ready?

458
00:58:24,543 --> 00:58:26,671
She doesn't have a costume. There is no set.

459
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:30,592
Honey, she doesn't need that bullshit. She's perfect.

460
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:34,895
Perhaps. But that is not for you to decide, that is for me to decide.

461
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,100
Ch.

462
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:41,394
It's my show, and I say she's not ready.

463
00:58:41,977 --> 00:58:45,732
Clearly, I've offended you, and I apologize.

464
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:47,399
Thank you.

465
00:58:47,566 --> 00:58:49,034
Here's the thing:

466
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,445
This show might be yours...

467
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:55,991
...but the girls and you...

468
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,827
...are mine.

469
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,963
Right?

470
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,508
You're mine.

471
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:10,005
And if you need a stronger reminder of that, you let me know, okay?

472
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:12,803
That won't be necessary.

473
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:17,142
So with or without your blessing, she's gonna be on that stage tomorrow?

474
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:21,979
- I'll see what I can do.       - Attagirl.

475
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:23,314
All right.

476
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:26,026
You look fantastic, by the way.

477
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:29,324
Big show, girls.

478
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:35,993
Thank you.

479
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:38,534
- For what?       - The Cook.

480
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,043
- It was nothing.       - Shut up.

481
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:44,335
No one takes a risk for anyone in here.

482
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:46,921
So thank you.

483
00:59:47,084 --> 00:59:48,131
You're welcome.

484
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:50,796
You got family?

485
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:54,512
No.

486
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:56,472
Oh, that's rig ht.

487
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:58,808
I forgot, you're an orphan.

488
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,189
I ran away from mine.

489
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:04,685
I thought I was pretty smart at the time, but ....

490
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,354
Sweet Pea followed.

491
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:12,694
Which is crazy, because she never even had a real problem with Mom and Dad.

492
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:16,238
She just cares about you a lot.

493
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:22,415
Have you just ever wanted to just take something back?

494
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:24,876
You know, something you said.

495
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:26,381
Something you did.

496
01:00:29,918 --> 01:00:31,716
All the time.

497
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:27,938
Amber?

498
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:29,648
The Mayor comes tonight.

499
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:32,780
I've never seen him without a big stogie in his mouth.

500
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:36,989
Ugh. I hate those cigars. I can never get that stink out of my hair.

501
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:41,623
- What?       - it's you.

502
01:01:42,324 --> 01:01:45,294
- You have to get his lighter.       - I'm not doing that.

503
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:47,420
- I can't.       - Yes, you can.

504
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:49,126
Come on, be reasonable.

505
01:01:49,289 --> 01:01:52,293
There's got to be another way, or someone else who can do it.

506
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:56,088
He's your client.

507
01:01:57,297 --> 01:01:59,015
Yeah, but what if I screw it up?

508
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:00,805
You can do this.

509
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:06,645
Well, he keeps it here, you know. In his breast pocket.

510
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:10,481
So then you do the good old kiss-the-neck...

511
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:12,191
...rub-his-chest...

512
01:02:12,354 --> 01:02:13,606
...reach in...

513
01:02:13,772 --> 01:02:15,194
...and bam...

514
01:02:15,357 --> 01:02:17,075
...you're gold.

515
01:02:18,485 --> 01:02:20,078
Yeah.

516
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:22,080
Kiss the neck.

517
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:24,245
- He'll like that.       - Heh, heh.

518
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:26,877
Don't part with your illusions.

519
01:02:27,035 --> 01:02:31,882
When they are gone, you may still exist, but you will cease to live.

520
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:35,340
Who said that? Mark Twain.

521
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:39,180
Wise man. You are going to be fine tonight.

522
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:41,049
All right.

523
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:42,843
Now...

524
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:45,303
...showtime.

525
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:07,723
Gentlemen. Welcome.

526
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:12,983
We have a new girl for you tonight. Something extra special.

527
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,027
It is a work-in-progress...

528
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:20,942
...so I apologize in advance for the raw nature of the performance.

529
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:22,575
I will say, however...

530
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:26,246
...that is part of the charm.

531
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:29,742
It is my pleasure to introduce to you...

532
01:04:30,325 --> 01:04:32,669
...this little baby doll.

533
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,497
Okay. This is how it's gonna go.

534
01:05:17,664 --> 01:05:20,167
Amber will keep the bird on station.

535
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:23,678
Blondie, you'll operate the 50 cal here and the 30 down there.

536
01:05:25,088 --> 01:05:30,140
The rest of you, drop into the courtyard and kill the creatures in your way.

537
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:34,602
Now, when you reach the nest, you'll find the baby.

538
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:36,516
You'll have to slit its throat.

539
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:40,521
Down inside its neck are two crystals...

540
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:45,909
...that, when struck together, produce the most magnificent fire you'll ever see.

541
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:49,366
Amber...

542
01:05:49,863 --> 01:05:51,160
...put us on approach.

543
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:54,201
Roger that. Starting my run.

544
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:16,438
Nice.

545
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:19,230
Remember:

546
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:23,063
Don't ever write a check with your mouth you can't cash with your ass.

547
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:26,528
Oh, yeah, and one more thing.

548
01:06:28,276 --> 01:06:29,949
Don't wake the mother.

549
01:06:49,881 --> 01:06:51,098
Here we go, ladies.

550
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:56,855
Go! Go! Go!

551
01:07:09,234 --> 01:07:10,952
Go!

552
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:15,535
Up!

553
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:18,371
Go!

554
01:07:23,331 --> 01:07:24,833
Up!

555
01:09:34,087 --> 01:09:35,339
Whoa!

556
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:34,960
I got an idea.

557
01:13:35,995 --> 01:13:37,087
Hold on!

558
01:13:57,767 --> 01:13:59,269
I got you now!

559
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:06,943
Take that, you ugly mother.

560
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:11,656
Amber, where is she?

561
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:13,324
Check our 6. I don't see her.

562
01:14:19,789 --> 01:14:22,668
Blondie, keep your eyes peeled.

563
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:46,778
I'll kill yo...

564
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:55,579
She's all yours, Baby.

565
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:29,885
I can't believe I did it.

566
01:16:30,044 --> 01:16:32,012
Damn, that girl can dance.

567
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:34,424
See what you can do?

568
01:16:35,132 --> 01:16:37,385
Wow, Amber.

569
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:39,637
Check it out.

570
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:41,765
- Halfway home.       - Yeah.

571
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:43,353
Let me see it.

572
01:16:46,352 --> 01:16:47,774
it's just like I said:

573
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:50,861
You kiss the neck, it works every time.

574
01:16:52,191 --> 01:16:54,569
- Good job.       - How'd we do?

575
01:16:55,402 --> 01:16:57,871
Nice. Here.

576
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:02,372
- And he didn't even notice.       - No. No idea.

577
01:17:10,584 --> 01:17:12,302
Good work, Amber.

578
01:17:13,546 --> 01:17:15,048
- Thanks, Baby.       - Cheers.

579
01:17:15,214 --> 01:17:17,558
- Cheers.       - Cheers?

580
01:17:17,842 --> 01:17:19,594
What are we celebrating?

581
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:21,144
Huh?

582
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:24,015
Who should I be congratulating?

583
01:17:24,181 --> 01:17:26,900
It was just Babydoll's first time on stage.

584
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:28,561
You know how scary that can be.

585
01:17:29,186 --> 01:17:30,403
Yeah.

586
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,982
The bond of the theater.

587
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:35,944
Hm?

588
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:39,075
I mean, what else could it be?

589
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:45,829
I mean, it's not like any of you have anything to hide, is it?

590
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:47,420
No.

591
01:17:47,746 --> 01:17:50,249
It's not like anyone was in my office...

592
01:17:50,875 --> 01:17:53,378
...messing with my shit.

593
01:17:54,086 --> 01:17:57,511
No. it's not like people are missing things.

594
01:17:57,673 --> 01:18:01,598
You know, small little objects here and there.

595
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:06,607
No. No, that would be outrageous. That would be crazy.

596
01:18:06,765 --> 01:18:07,937
Right?

597
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:12,571
Because we have such an obvious explanation for this exuberance.

598
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:15,233
It's the fraternity of performers.

599
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:20,326
It's the adrenaline from the curtain rising.

600
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:23,536
Maybe this is my fault.

601
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:27,124
You know, maybe I've just become too familiar with you girls.

602
01:18:27,286 --> 01:18:29,459
Maybe I need to make an example of someone.

603
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:33,047
Re-establish the parameters of our relationship. What do you think?

604
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:36,008
Blondie, girls?

605
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:41,388
And what about you?

606
01:18:41,967 --> 01:18:43,310
Huh?

607
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:46,055
Ch.

608
01:18:47,181 --> 01:18:48,899
You think you're special, don't you?

609
01:18:49,934 --> 01:18:53,188
Well, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.

610
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:58,534
If I was not about to make a small fortune on you with the High Roller...

611
01:19:00,653 --> 01:19:05,955
...I would take you right now and I would pop that little smile...

612
01:19:06,116 --> 01:19:08,335
...right off of your face.

613
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:16,464
It saddens me that I have to resort to threats with you girls.

614
01:19:16,627 --> 01:19:18,595
I thought we were past that.

615
01:19:19,338 --> 01:19:22,968
I just... I need this bullshit to stop!

616
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:26,638
Gut of mutual respect.

617
01:19:26,804 --> 01:19:31,435
Let's get things back to how they were.

618
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:44,663
Well ....

619
01:19:46,865 --> 01:19:48,538
So much for that little experiment.

620
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:52,462
What are you saying?

621
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:54,373
I'm saying it's over.

622
01:19:55,207 --> 01:19:56,959
Right, Baby?

623
01:19:57,710 --> 01:19:58,757
I don't know.

624
01:19:59,253 --> 01:20:01,096
What do you mean, you don't know?

625
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:03,264
Blue's onto us.

626
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:04,716
We had a deal.

627
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:07,102
If I say it's over, it's over.

628
01:20:07,261 --> 01:20:09,434
We're this close, though. We can't just stop.

629
01:20:09,596 --> 01:20:13,567
Did you not hear Blue? He knows we're up to something.

630
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:14,978
He knows what we're doing.

631
01:20:15,144 --> 01:20:18,398
If he catches us for real, it won't be a lecture. You saw him.

632
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:22,410
Sweet Pea. Rocket is right. The High Roller comes tomorrow.

633
01:20:22,568 --> 01:20:25,993
- If we can just stick with the plan till then...       - No! You're screwed.

634
01:20:28,615 --> 01:20:30,242
We're out.

635
01:20:32,328 --> 01:20:33,580
Rocket...

636
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:36,291
...we're out.

637
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:39,593
I'm finishing this.

638
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:42,504
We are all finishing this.

639
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:45,845
You know it's the only way we can get out of here.

640
01:20:49,887 --> 01:20:51,935
You're gonna choose her...

641
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:54,934
...someone you barely know...

642
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:56,852
...over me?

643
01:20:57,144 --> 01:20:59,317
After all I've sacrificed for you.

644
01:21:02,191 --> 01:21:03,613
I'm sorry.

645
01:21:49,446 --> 01:21:50,698
Blondie?

646
01:21:50,864 --> 01:21:53,492
What are you doing down there? Are you all right?

647
01:21:53,659 --> 01:21:54,876
I'm sorry, it's nothing.

648
01:21:55,035 --> 01:21:57,254
What? What's wrong? Did someone hurt you?

649
01:21:57,413 --> 01:22:01,168
- No, it's not like that. It's really nothing.       - Clearly...

650
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:03,836
...it is not nothing.

651
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:06,259
Hey.

652
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:10,927
You can tell me. I am good listener.

653
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:13,850
Madame Gorski...

654
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:15,643
...please.

655
01:22:15,806 --> 01:22:17,683
I know that look.

656
01:22:18,475 --> 01:22:21,820
You think you're all alone, and that no one can help you.

657
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:25,153
There is a way to fix anything.

658
01:22:25,983 --> 01:22:27,451
Now...

659
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:30,446
...tell me what is wrong, child.

660
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:35,246
Okay.

661
01:22:38,287 --> 01:22:40,335
Promise you can keep a secret?

662
01:22:40,497 --> 01:22:41,999
- Yes.       - Yes.

663
01:23:01,059 --> 01:23:03,278
- Where the hell is she?       - I don't know.

664
01:23:03,437 --> 01:23:05,531
We need your music.

665
01:23:08,066 --> 01:23:12,537
You know what, forget it. No, it's too late. Sweet Pea was right.

666
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:16,792
What are you talking about? The three of us, we can...

667
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:18,577
I don't think we can do this.

668
01:23:19,453 --> 01:23:22,923
I don't wanna do something stupid that's gonna put you guys in danger.

669
01:23:23,874 --> 01:23:24,921
I'm sorry.

670
01:23:27,127 --> 01:23:29,300
Hey, we got this far, right?

671
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:32,304
I mean, that's something not a lot of people could have done.

672
01:23:34,927 --> 01:23:37,555
How bad can the High Roller be, anyway?

673
01:23:43,894 --> 01:23:47,114
Don't you girls have some work you should be doing?

674
01:23:48,315 --> 01:23:49,942
- You came to help us.       - No.

675
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:53,074
I came to keep you from getting killed.

676
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:54,696
Thank you.

677
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:56,410
We don't have a lot of time.

678
01:23:56,573 --> 01:23:59,497
If you're done with the pleasantries, you got a dance to do.

679
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:02,334
Amber, radio.

680
01:24:28,438 --> 01:24:30,611
What the hell are you doing?

681
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:48,960
You're gonna wanna watch this.

682
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:04,478
Turn off your mind

683
01:25:04,641 --> 01:25:08,145
Relax and float downstream

684
01:25:09,354 --> 01:25:12,358
It is not dying

685
01:25:13,066 --> 01:25:16,696
It is not dying

686
01:25:17,529 --> 01:25:19,281
Lay down all thought

687
01:25:19,448 --> 01:25:22,873
Surrender to the void

688
01:25:24,453 --> 01:25:27,377
It is shining

689
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:31,044
It is shining

690
01:25:38,634 --> 01:25:42,684
Ladies, this is what's on our dance card for tonight.

691
01:25:42,846 --> 01:25:46,817
The bomb, code-named "Kitchen Knife," is on a hijacked train.

692
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:49,819
It is protected by a couple dozen mechanized gunmen.

693
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:51,612
The idea is simple:

694
01:25:51,772 --> 01:25:56,573
Take care of the gunmen, deactivate the bomb, then steal it.

695
01:25:56,735 --> 01:26:01,081
The code numbers for the bomb and the jetpacks for your escape are in that duffel.

696
01:26:01,281 --> 01:26:02,578
Got it.

697
01:26:02,908 --> 01:26:04,785
Sweet Pea.

698
01:26:04,951 --> 01:26:07,079
I'm glad you changed your mind.

699
01:26:13,502 --> 01:26:16,096
Well, there you have it.

700
01:26:16,546 --> 01:26:20,221
You know, for those who fight for it...

701
01:26:20,384 --> 01:26:24,810
...life has a flavor the sheltered will never know.

702
01:26:25,347 --> 01:26:28,271
Oh, yeah. One last thing.

703
01:26:28,767 --> 01:26:32,863
The bomb's timer is set to detonate when it reaches the city.

704
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:37,151
So if I were you, I'd hurry!

705
01:27:13,937 --> 01:27:15,109
Weapons hot, ladies.

706
01:27:15,981 --> 01:27:17,028
Hot.

707
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:18,942
- Hot.       - Hot.

708
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:28,327
I've got a lock.

709
01:27:38,754 --> 01:27:40,097
Good luck.

710
01:27:52,726 --> 01:27:55,354
- We're down.       - Copy that.

711
01:30:37,182 --> 01:30:38,855
Warning:

712
01:30:39,017 --> 01:30:41,861
Weapon will activate in four minutes, 15 seconds.

713
01:30:44,397 --> 01:30:45,444
- Warning:       - Codes!

714
01:30:45,607 --> 01:30:49,532
Weapon will activate in four minutes, 10 seconds.

715
01:30:50,612 --> 01:30:55,459
Warning: Weapon will activate in four minutes, five seconds.

716
01:30:58,662 --> 01:31:01,836
A deactivation procedure has been initiated.

717
01:31:05,418 --> 01:31:07,841
Deactivation procedure complete.

718
01:31:08,004 --> 01:31:09,381
Weapon deactivated.

719
01:31:16,805 --> 01:31:17,852
Whoa!

720
01:31:31,653 --> 01:31:35,328
Hurry, Amber. We gotta get this thing out of here.

721
01:31:35,657 --> 01:31:37,204
On my way.

722
01:31:48,086 --> 01:31:50,464
Please refer to the operations manual.

723
01:31:50,630 --> 01:31:52,598
For details on ....

724
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:00,603
Amber, she's good.

725
01:32:01,224 --> 01:32:02,851
I'm taking her out.

726
01:32:06,312 --> 01:32:07,985
Guys, it's caught on something.

727
01:32:08,606 --> 01:32:11,405
Hold up. We missed one.

728
01:32:37,886 --> 01:32:40,810
Override procedures complete.

729
01:32:41,264 --> 01:32:43,358
Weapon active.

730
01:32:44,809 --> 01:32:50,111
Proximity warning.

731
01:32:51,608 --> 01:32:55,454
Proximity warning.

732
01:33:37,070 --> 01:33:39,289
Amber, the bomb's active.

733
01:33:39,697 --> 01:33:43,622
Warning: Weapon will activate in 45 seconds.

734
01:33:43,785 --> 01:33:45,128
Get free.

735
01:33:49,124 --> 01:33:50,467
Whoa!

736
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:52,468
Rocket, let's go.

737
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:54,925
Weapon will activate in 25 seconds.

738
01:33:55,088 --> 01:33:57,591
It's broke. it's not gonna work.

739
01:33:58,633 --> 01:34:00,931
I'm on full burn. We'll go together.

740
01:34:01,094 --> 01:34:03,062
It's not gonna carry the both of us.

741
01:34:03,221 --> 01:34:05,974
- We have to try.       - Okay, we'll try.

742
01:34:06,141 --> 01:34:08,143
But you've gotta promise me two things.

743
01:34:08,309 --> 01:34:09,731
Rocket, let's go.

744
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:12,738
- The first thing is...       - Weapon will activate in 15 seconds.

745
01:34:12,897 --> 01:34:14,240
...don't get mad about this.

746
01:34:14,399 --> 01:34:16,072
About what?

747
01:34:17,569 --> 01:34:19,037
This.

748
01:34:22,115 --> 01:34:23,788
Rocket!

749
01:34:36,629 --> 01:34:41,556
Weapon will activate in 10, nine...

750
01:34:41,718 --> 01:34:46,519
...eight, seven, six...

751
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:49,810
...five, four...

752
01:34:49,976 --> 01:34:54,732
."three, two, one.

753
01:35:31,309 --> 01:35:32,856
The second thing is...

754
01:35:35,647 --> 01:35:37,490
...when you get home...

755
01:35:39,651 --> 01:35:41,153
...when you get free...

756
01:35:44,656 --> 01:35:47,205
...you tell Mom I love her.

757
01:35:48,826 --> 01:35:51,295
- I'll tell her.       - Mom.

758
01:35:51,454 --> 01:35:53,081
I promise.

759
01:36:11,057 --> 01:36:12,730
Oh, my.

760
01:36:12,892 --> 01:36:16,567
You, what did you do? You simple, inbred idiot.

761
01:36:16,729 --> 01:36:19,027
Sir, don't know what happened. I just...

762
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:21,033
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

763
01:36:21,192 --> 01:36:23,536
Get her up. Get her up, CJ!

764
01:36:25,863 --> 01:36:27,581
Yes. Yeah, look.

765
01:36:27,740 --> 01:36:29,788
I want you to look at what you did.

766
01:36:29,951 --> 01:36:33,125
Look at what you did, you bitch!

767
01:36:33,871 --> 01:36:35,214
Amber, sweetheart.

768
01:36:35,373 --> 01:36:38,798
You've got Sweet Pea's slot in tonight's show. Go get ready.

769
01:36:40,211 --> 01:36:43,385
Go get ready.

770
01:36:44,799 --> 01:36:46,142
Go!

771
01:36:49,137 --> 01:36:51,231
Take her to the closet.

772
01:36:55,435 --> 01:36:57,483
As for you...

773
01:36:59,731 --> 01:37:00,778
...it's Showtime.

774
01:37:20,835 --> 01:37:24,715
The High Roller is here. I need you to focus for me.

775
01:37:24,881 --> 01:37:27,009
Ah. Thank you.

776
01:37:29,385 --> 01:37:30,807
Girls?

777
01:37:30,970 --> 01:37:35,942
Can you just gather around for a second? I wanna say a few words.

778
01:37:37,852 --> 01:37:40,901
That's all right. You can just finish getting her dressed.

779
01:37:41,522 --> 01:37:43,820
Okay. There we go.

780
01:37:43,983 --> 01:37:45,826
Very nice.

781
01:37:47,528 --> 01:37:49,121
All right.

782
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:55,496
I try to give you all...

783
01:37:56,162 --> 01:37:57,789
...a good life.

784
01:37:58,706 --> 01:38:01,175
I try. I do.

785
01:38:02,126 --> 01:38:05,801
And all I ask for in return is just for...

786
01:38:06,297 --> 01:38:07,970
...respect...

787
01:38:08,633 --> 01:38:10,681
...honesty.

788
01:38:10,843 --> 01:38:12,595
You know... Oh, that's okay, Margaret.

789
01:38:12,762 --> 01:38:15,686
A give-and-take relationship.

790
01:38:16,307 --> 01:38:19,151
But it's come to my attention... it's come to our attention...

791
01:38:19,310 --> 01:38:22,689
...that a few bad eggs...

792
01:38:22,855 --> 01:38:24,778
...led by one little egg in particular...

793
01:38:26,317 --> 01:38:30,072
...have spit in the face of that generosity...

794
01:38:30,238 --> 01:38:33,993
...and are plotting against me.

795
01:38:34,784 --> 01:38:36,252
Me.

796
01:38:37,495 --> 01:38:38,747
Your father.

797
01:38:39,580 --> 01:38:41,332
Your lover.

798
01:38:42,083 --> 01:38:44,427
Your employer.

799
01:38:45,962 --> 01:38:49,592
Plotting to take from me my most precious possessions.

800
01:38:49,757 --> 01:38:50,929
Your very selves.

801
01:38:51,134 --> 01:38:52,477
Blue, what you doing?

802
01:38:53,010 --> 01:38:56,184
- Hm?       - You got the information. You have won.

803
01:38:56,806 --> 01:38:59,400
This little fantasy of freedom is all they have.

804
01:39:01,018 --> 01:39:05,023
No, no, no. No one's buying that, honey. No one's buying that, Vera.

805
01:39:05,982 --> 01:39:09,407
There is nothing you can do to me that you haven't already done.

806
01:39:09,610 --> 01:39:12,864
You listen to me, you old whore.

807
01:39:13,030 --> 01:39:17,706
It's too late to play the good guy. it's far too late.

808
01:39:17,869 --> 01:39:22,170
You're suddenly not aware of what it is we do here?

809
01:39:22,331 --> 01:39:27,428
I teach them to survive you.

810
01:39:29,672 --> 01:39:33,427
- All right.       - I'm sorry! I didn't mean to say anything.

811
01:39:33,593 --> 01:39:34,640
I'm sorry.

812
01:39:34,802 --> 01:39:36,475
No, Blondie.

813
01:39:36,637 --> 01:39:38,890
I didn't mean to.

814
01:39:39,140 --> 01:39:40,813
He said everything would be okay.

815
01:39:42,059 --> 01:39:43,857
Blue, this is a mistake.

816
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:45,397
Please don't do this, okay?

817
01:39:45,563 --> 01:39:49,284
That's right. Our dear Blondie came to us...

818
01:39:49,442 --> 01:39:52,821
...desperately trying to help her sisters off this most dangerous path.

819
01:39:52,987 --> 01:39:54,830
At first, we didn't even believe her.

820
01:39:54,989 --> 01:40:00,086
But after hearing who was involved, frankly, it started to make sense.

821
01:40:00,661 --> 01:40:02,755
- Right here?       - Blue.

822
01:40:05,249 --> 01:40:08,378
"Map. Fire."

823
01:40:10,254 --> 01:40:14,760
Looks like that chicken was counted a little before it hatched.

824
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:18,513
Ain't that right, Amber?

825
01:40:21,849 --> 01:40:24,819
You have anything to say? Anything?

826
01:40:25,853 --> 01:40:28,823
Blue, we didn't... We were still...

827
01:40:28,981 --> 01:40:30,608
You know what, sweetheart?

828
01:40:30,775 --> 01:40:32,322
It's okay.

829
01:40:32,735 --> 01:40:34,282
It's okay.

830
01:40:37,990 --> 01:40:39,037
NO!

831
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:40,827
- Oh, my God!       - Okay, calm down.

832
01:40:40,993 --> 01:40:44,714
This will all be over soon and we can get back to business as usual.

833
01:40:44,872 --> 01:40:47,466
Blondie, I wanna thank you for everything you've done.

834
01:40:47,625 --> 01:40:48,922
I am so sorry.

835
01:40:49,085 --> 01:40:52,305
The thing is, we hate snitches, so ....

836
01:40:55,841 --> 01:40:57,388
No!

837
01:41:02,682 --> 01:41:04,901
Okay. Here.

838
01:41:05,059 --> 01:41:06,606
I hate guns.

839
01:41:06,769 --> 01:41:09,488
I hope everyone's learned a valuable lesson here.

840
01:41:09,647 --> 01:41:13,572
Especially you, Madame Gorski. Get her out of here.

841
01:41:13,734 --> 01:41:15,828
Let's get these bodies out of here, please.

842
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:19,540
And the rest of you, you got a show to do. So go on, go get them, girls.

843
01:41:19,699 --> 01:41:21,622
Make it count.

844
01:41:37,675 --> 01:41:40,144
I've been thinking a lot...

845
01:41:41,721 --> 01:41:44,895
...about all that money you're gonna make me.

846
01:41:45,391 --> 01:41:49,396
I've been thinking a lot about the High Roller and his hands all over you.

847
01:41:49,562 --> 01:41:52,907
I've been thinking about all those people out there...

848
01:41:53,941 --> 01:41:56,160
...just watching you and lusting after you.

849
01:41:56,319 --> 01:41:58,287
And you'd think that would give me pleasure.

850
01:41:58,446 --> 01:42:01,541
I mean, I'm in the business of pleasure.

851
01:42:02,491 --> 01:42:04,789
But you know what it makes me feel like?

852
01:42:04,952 --> 01:42:08,923
I'm gonna be honest with you. it makes me feel like I'm this little boy...

853
01:42:09,081 --> 01:42:11,209
...sitting in the corner of the sandbox...

854
01:42:11,375 --> 01:42:14,925
...while everybody gets to play with my toys...

855
01:42:16,339 --> 01:42:17,807
...but me.

856
01:42:18,716 --> 01:42:20,218
So you know what I'm gonna do?

857
01:42:20,968 --> 01:42:24,347
I'm gonna take my toys and I'm gonna go home.

858
01:42:26,724 --> 01:42:29,398
I'm going home now... Oh, that's good! That's it.

859
01:42:29,602 --> 01:42:31,980
Oh, is that it'?! That's my little bitch.

860
01:42:35,399 --> 01:42:36,867
This what you like?

861
01:42:37,026 --> 01:42:38,869
Come here!

862
01:42:40,404 --> 01:42:42,077
What? No, no, no.

863
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:44,708
Come on. Come on!

864
01:42:45,534 --> 01:42:48,583
Did you lose your fight? Huh?

865
01:42:49,121 --> 01:42:50,498
No.

866
01:42:52,208 --> 01:42:53,425
I just found it.

867
01:43:05,012 --> 01:43:07,060
You'll never have me.

868
01:43:08,557 --> 01:43:09,183
Ever.

869
01:43:09,809 --> 01:43:10,025
Ever.

870
01:43:18,943 --> 01:43:21,412
- Sweet Pea.       - Where's Amber and Blondie?

871
01:43:22,321 --> 01:43:23,664
It's just us now.

872
01:43:24,782 --> 01:43:27,285
We have to go, Sweet Pea. Come on.

873
01:44:05,489 --> 01:44:06,991
- That's it.       - Okay.

874
01:44:32,057 --> 01:44:34,310
- Now what?       - Wait for it.

875
01:44:45,196 --> 01:44:46,539
Come on.

876
01:45:09,804 --> 01:45:11,397
Damn it.

877
01:45:12,848 --> 01:45:14,521
This can't be.

878
01:45:15,059 --> 01:45:16,356
We did everything right.

879
01:45:17,228 --> 01:45:21,734
A map, fire, a knife, a key, and one thing more.

880
01:45:22,233 --> 01:45:23,701
One thing more.

881
01:45:29,031 --> 01:45:30,578
It's me.

882
01:45:31,075 --> 01:45:32,543
What?

883
01:45:32,701 --> 01:45:35,500
Oh, it's me. Of course it's me.

884
01:45:36,163 --> 01:45:38,507
It's the only way this ever could have ended.

885
01:45:38,666 --> 01:45:40,259
What do you mean?

886
01:45:43,587 --> 01:45:45,089
I'm saying you go home.

887
01:45:45,923 --> 01:45:48,017
Go home to your family.

888
01:45:48,926 --> 01:45:51,395
You tell your mom what Rocket said.

889
01:45:51,637 --> 01:45:53,435
Make her happy.

890
01:45:55,099 --> 01:45:57,397
Go out and live a normal life...

891
01:45:57,601 --> 01:45:59,069
...love...

892
01:45:59,603 --> 01:46:01,196
...be free.

893
01:46:02,606 --> 01:46:04,700
You have to live for all of us now.

894
01:46:05,192 --> 01:46:08,412
- Baby, no. You can't do that.       - Yes, Sweet Pea.

895
01:46:08,571 --> 01:46:10,448
You're the strongest.

896
01:46:10,614 --> 01:46:13,618
You're the only one of us that ever had a chance out there.

897
01:46:13,784 --> 01:46:16,253
You going home and living, that's how we win.

898
01:46:16,829 --> 01:46:19,298
It's okay. it's okay. it's better this way.

899
01:46:21,458 --> 01:46:23,005
Now listen.

900
01:46:23,711 --> 01:46:25,429
I'm gonna walk out there...

901
01:46:26,463 --> 01:46:29,216
...and when they come after me, you go, okay?

902
01:46:29,967 --> 01:46:31,685
There's gotta be another way.

903
01:46:32,469 --> 01:46:33,937
No.

904
01:46:35,097 --> 01:46:36,644
This is right.

905
01:46:39,602 --> 01:46:41,775
This was never my story.

906
01:46:42,563 --> 01:46:44,110
It's yours.

907
01:46:44,523 --> 01:46:46,275
Now, don't screw it up, okay?

908
01:46:51,447 --> 01:46:54,326
You stay off the roads and you find a bus station, all right?

909
01:46:55,492 --> 01:46:57,210
You're gonna be fine.

910
01:47:21,936 --> 01:47:24,064
Where you going, sweetheart?

911
01:47:34,823 --> 01:47:37,918
I said, where you going?

912
01:48:38,637 --> 01:48:40,355
There you are.

913
01:48:41,473 --> 01:48:43,851
You gave us quite a scare, you know?

914
01:48:45,686 --> 01:48:47,188
Where am I?

915
01:48:47,604 --> 01:48:50,278
You're safe for now.

916
01:48:53,110 --> 01:48:57,741
I don't know how to put this delicately so I will spare you the insult of being vague...

917
01:48:59,283 --> 01:49:01,706
...that you and I are supposed to screw.

918
01:49:02,578 --> 01:49:05,127
I hope you'll forgive my language...

919
01:49:05,289 --> 01:49:08,634
...but I think you'll find it is in keeping with the spirit of the arrangement.

920
01:49:09,334 --> 01:49:14,340
Now I have absolutely no intention of simply taking you.

921
01:49:15,424 --> 01:49:16,846
In fact...

922
01:49:18,010 --> 01:49:19,762
...I can think of nothing more offensive.

923
01:49:21,055 --> 01:49:24,400
You see, I am what you might call a man who has everything.

924
01:49:25,267 --> 01:49:30,319
And yet, I lack the one thing money can't buy.

925
01:49:31,815 --> 01:49:34,489
- Love?       - Close.

926
01:49:35,444 --> 01:49:36,821
Truth...

927
01:49:37,488 --> 01:49:38,831
...is more accurate.

928
01:49:41,450 --> 01:49:45,876
I seek a true moment, a moment of truth.

929
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:48,173
In this...

930
01:49:49,124 --> 01:49:50,967
...world of lies.

931
01:49:52,753 --> 01:49:55,506
It just so happens that...

932
01:49:55,672 --> 01:49:57,891
...that moment...

933
01:49:58,050 --> 01:50:02,806
...that fragile, delicate thing like a glass egg...

934
01:50:02,971 --> 01:50:07,602
...or a sand castle, well, that moment...

935
01:50:08,102 --> 01:50:12,027
...can only be given by a non-faker.

936
01:50:13,607 --> 01:50:15,280
A non-actor.

937
01:50:16,151 --> 01:50:17,744
That's you.

938
01:50:18,612 --> 01:50:20,205
I don't understand.

939
01:50:22,074 --> 01:50:24,293
Well, I have spent...

940
01:50:24,451 --> 01:50:28,081
...a small fortune getting you in this room.

941
01:50:28,831 --> 01:50:31,175
This golden cage.

942
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:37,431
You're supposed to give yourself to me.

943
01:50:38,549 --> 01:50:40,301
It's completely physical.

944
01:50:41,343 --> 01:50:45,143
I might have your body...

945
01:50:45,305 --> 01:50:47,399
...but the real you that...

946
01:50:48,767 --> 01:50:53,068
."intangible, and indefinable spark that is you.

947
01:50:55,107 --> 01:50:57,326
Well, that you I will never know.

948
01:50:59,528 --> 01:51:01,906
And, yet, that is precisely what I want.

949
01:51:10,122 --> 01:51:11,749
I'm sorry.

950
01:51:13,584 --> 01:51:15,257
You seem really nice.

951
01:51:17,421 --> 01:51:19,423
You want me to lie to you?

952
01:51:20,048 --> 01:51:22,096
No, I don't.

953
01:51:22,759 --> 01:51:25,057
All I require from you...

954
01:51:25,929 --> 01:51:28,057
...is a sliver of a moment.

955
01:51:29,766 --> 01:51:31,985
To have you not by force...

956
01:51:33,270 --> 01:51:35,773
...but simply as a man and a woman.

957
01:51:38,275 --> 01:51:42,121
To see in your eyes that simple truth...

958
01:51:43,363 --> 01:51:45,536
...that you give yourself to me freely.

959
01:51:46,408 --> 01:51:48,627
Not because you have to...

960
01:51:49,620 --> 01:51:51,418
...but because you want to.

961
01:51:54,124 --> 01:51:57,924
Now, of course, you're such a gem...

962
01:52:00,088 --> 01:52:01,806
...I will give as well.

963
01:52:04,635 --> 01:52:06,637
I'm willing to give you freedom.

964
01:52:08,805 --> 01:52:11,149
Pure and total freedom.

965
01:52:11,516 --> 01:52:14,144
Freedom from the drudgery of every day life...

966
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:19,741
...freedom as abstract ideal.

967
01:52:21,235 --> 01:52:23,112
Freedom from pain...

968
01:52:25,822 --> 01:52:28,166
...freedom from responsibility...

969
01:52:30,535 --> 01:52:32,412
...freedom from guilt...

970
01:52:34,498 --> 01:52:35,875
...from regret...

971
01:52:37,876 --> 01:52:39,719
...freedom from sadness...

972
01:52:42,256 --> 01:52:44,384
...freedom from loss...

973
01:52:47,970 --> 01:52:50,018
...the freedom to be happy.

974
01:53:00,524 --> 01:53:02,367
Don't close your eyes.

975
01:53:03,819 --> 01:53:05,446
I need you to look at me.

976
01:53:09,950 --> 01:53:11,793
The freedom to love.

977
01:53:32,764 --> 01:53:34,391
Jesus.

978
01:53:39,229 --> 01:53:40,651
Did... '?

979
01:53:41,648 --> 01:53:43,867
Did you see the way she looked at me?

980
01:53:45,902 --> 01:53:49,156
Just in that last moment. It was like ....

981
01:53:57,914 --> 01:53:59,382
Doctor?

982
01:53:59,708 --> 01:54:00,755
Is it done?

983
01:54:00,917 --> 01:54:04,672
Dr. Gorski, what do you know about this one?

984
01:54:04,838 --> 01:54:07,466
Uh, there was something very peculiar.

985
01:54:07,632 --> 01:54:10,932
Yes. Her mother's death plunged her into a deep depression.

986
01:54:11,094 --> 01:54:14,974
And then in a fit, she accidentally killed her sister.

987
01:54:15,140 --> 01:54:16,266
Poor child.

988
01:54:17,225 --> 01:54:22,152
It's a shame I couldn't do more for her. I wasn't given much time, you see.

989
01:54:22,314 --> 01:54:24,863
Yes, but you recommended the procedure.

990
01:54:25,025 --> 01:54:26,777
Oh, I'm afraid not.

991
01:54:26,943 --> 01:54:29,287
I will admit she has been quite a handful.

992
01:54:29,446 --> 01:54:34,327
In just one week here, she stabbed an orderly, started a fire...

993
01:54:34,493 --> 01:54:37,121
...and helped another patient to escape.

994
01:54:39,414 --> 01:54:41,963
But I don't agree with this solution, doctor.

995
01:54:42,125 --> 01:54:45,971
But why would you sign for a procedure you don't agree with?

996
01:54:46,129 --> 01:54:47,472
Well, I...

997
01:54:51,468 --> 01:54:53,311
That is your signature, is it not?

998
01:54:53,929 --> 01:54:56,808
I've been doing this for quite some time, doctor...

999
01:54:56,973 --> 01:55:00,648
...and to be honest with you, I've wondered myself whether or not it's right.

1000
01:55:00,811 --> 01:55:05,282
And I have seen some tortured souls in here. Believe me.

1001
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:06,657
But this one ....

1002
01:55:07,567 --> 01:55:09,661
Something in her eyes.

1003
01:55:09,986 --> 01:55:12,239
I've never seen anyone that ....

1004
01:55:13,156 --> 01:55:15,158
it's the way she looked at me.

1005
01:55:15,325 --> 01:55:17,544
It's like she wanted me to do it.

1006
01:55:22,249 --> 01:55:23,671
I hope it helps her.

1007
01:56:07,085 --> 01:56:08,712
Hi.

1008
01:56:12,174 --> 01:56:13,892
You remember me?

1009
01:56:14,885 --> 01:56:18,355
Listen. Listen, I got a bad feeling, okay?

1010
01:56:18,513 --> 01:56:19,730
These boys do too.

1011
01:56:20,765 --> 01:56:22,813
This is not the way we should be running this place.

1012
01:56:22,976 --> 01:56:25,104
We don't run the place. I run it.

1013
01:56:25,270 --> 01:56:27,113
In the chair.

1014
01:56:29,399 --> 01:56:30,742
Look...

1015
01:56:32,402 --> 01:56:33,745
...I'm not....

1016
01:56:34,488 --> 01:56:37,583
- I'm not hurting these girls anymore.       - I'm not doing this.

1017
01:56:37,741 --> 01:56:40,995
Guys, don't do this to me now, please.

1018
01:56:41,161 --> 01:56:42,913
I need her in that chair.

1019
01:56:44,789 --> 01:56:47,588
Put her in the goddamn chair!

1020
01:56:50,545 --> 01:56:52,263
Thank you.

1021
01:56:55,884 --> 01:56:57,807
Close the door, please.

1022
01:57:03,391 --> 01:57:07,737
What? What is it, you're not here? Huh?

1023
01:57:07,896 --> 01:57:11,867
You're not here, you're in paradise? No, no, no. No, no, no.

1024
01:57:12,025 --> 01:57:13,743
No, no, no.

1025
01:57:16,446 --> 01:57:18,289
You're still here.

1026
01:57:18,615 --> 01:57:20,788
You're here with me.

1027
01:57:22,327 --> 01:57:24,295
In all this shit.

1028
01:57:25,455 --> 01:57:28,299
And you don't go away unless I say so.

1029
01:57:29,042 --> 01:57:30,464
Okay?

1030
01:57:44,182 --> 01:57:45,980
That's not right.

1031
01:57:46,434 --> 01:57:48,402
That's not right.

1032
01:57:48,812 --> 01:57:50,109
Come back.

1033
01:57:55,318 --> 01:57:57,787
No! No!

1034
01:57:57,946 --> 01:57:59,823
I said you don't go!

1035
01:58:00,574 --> 01:58:02,702
You come back to me.

1036
01:58:05,829 --> 01:58:08,673
- Stop right there. Move away from the girl.       - What are you doing?

1037
01:58:08,832 --> 01:58:12,006
Aah! Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Wait. Aah!

1038
01:58:12,168 --> 01:58:14,170
What in God's name have you been doing up here?

1039
01:58:14,337 --> 01:58:17,011
I wasn't doing anything. Look at her.

1040
01:58:17,173 --> 01:58:19,596
She's gone. Look at her face! She's not here.

1041
01:58:19,759 --> 01:58:22,808
What do you think I wanna do? I take care of these girls.

1042
01:58:22,971 --> 01:58:25,520
I look out for them. These are my girls. Tell them.

1043
01:58:26,349 --> 01:58:28,101
Tell them!

1044
01:58:28,268 --> 01:58:29,690
Get him out of here.

1045
01:58:29,853 --> 01:58:33,357
- Now.       - Wait. Wait, wait, wait! Wait.

1046
01:58:33,523 --> 01:58:35,776
It's not me you want, it's her stepfather.

1047
01:58:35,942 --> 01:58:39,663
I'll tell you everything. I'll tell you... I'll tell you about the money.

1048
01:58:39,988 --> 01:58:42,241
Just keep going down the hall.

1049
01:58:43,450 --> 01:58:45,202
You all right, miss?

1050
01:58:49,414 --> 01:58:50,882
Miss?

1051
01:59:01,635 --> 01:59:05,765
And finally, this question:

1052
01:59:06,222 --> 01:59:09,522
The mystery of whose story it will be...

1053
01:59:09,976 --> 01:59:12,445
...of who draws the curtain.

1054
01:59:13,271 --> 01:59:16,775
Who is it that chooses our steps in the dance?

1055
01:59:17,609 --> 01:59:19,907
Who drives us mad...

1056
01:59:20,445 --> 01:59:21,822
...lashes us with whips...

1057
01:59:21,988 --> 01:59:26,084
...and crowns us with victory when we survive the impossible?

1058
01:59:27,035 --> 01:59:28,503
Who is it...

1059
01:59:29,663 --> 01:59:32,166
...that does all these things?

1060
01:59:33,667 --> 01:59:37,046
Bus 22 southbound to Fort Wayne will now begin loading.

1061
01:59:37,212 --> 01:59:40,307
Please have your tickets ready to show the driver.

1062
01:59:55,105 --> 01:59:56,357
Excuse me, miss?

1063
02:00:00,610 --> 02:00:02,453
Miss, can we have a word?

1064
02:00:02,696 --> 02:00:05,074
Is there a problem, gentlemen?

1065
02:00:05,240 --> 02:00:08,039
This doesn't concern you. I have questions for the lady.

1066
02:00:08,201 --> 02:00:11,045
Well, could you make it snappy? I need to stay on schedule.

1067
02:00:11,204 --> 02:00:13,081
- We understand.       - Do you?

1068
02:00:13,248 --> 02:00:15,751
That young woman's been on this bus since Hartford.

1069
02:00:15,917 --> 02:00:20,138
I don't see what she could possibly know about anything happening around here.

1070
02:00:20,296 --> 02:00:21,468
Is that true, miss?

1071
02:00:21,631 --> 02:00:25,477
I just let her off to use the restroom. Mine's not working.

1072
02:00:29,139 --> 02:00:32,564
- All right.       - Oh, and one more thing.

1073
02:00:33,143 --> 02:00:36,989
- She's been a joy the entire journey.       - Yes, I said, all right.

1074
02:00:39,399 --> 02:00:42,903
Sorry about the inconvenience, miss. You have yourself a nice trip now.

1075
02:00:43,069 --> 02:00:44,412
It's no problem.

1076
02:00:54,372 --> 02:00:57,967
- I don't have a ticket.       - I know. it's okay.

1077
02:00:58,126 --> 02:01:01,596
Go find a seat in the back. Try and get some sleep.

1078
02:01:02,297 --> 02:01:04,675
We got a long way to go.

1079
02:01:06,217 --> 02:01:07,469
Thank you.

1080
02:01:15,518 --> 02:01:19,364
Who honors those we love with the very life we live?

1081
02:01:20,356 --> 02:01:23,109
Who sends monsters to kill us...

1082
02:01:23,526 --> 02:01:27,156
...and at the same time sings that we'll never die?

1083
02:01:28,198 --> 02:01:33,125
Who teaches us what's real and how to laugh at lies?

1084
02:01:34,037 --> 02:01:38,167
Who decides why we live and what we'll die to defend?

1085
02:01:38,833 --> 02:01:40,801
Who chains us?

1086
02:01:41,002 --> 02:01:44,506
And who holds the key that can set us free?

1087
02:01:46,382 --> 02:01:47,884
It's you.

1088
02:01:48,593 --> 02:01:51,142
You have all the weapons you need.

1089
02:01:51,304 --> 02:01:52,351
Now Fight.
