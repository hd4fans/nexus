5
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:03,020
Previously on The Big Bang Theory:

6
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,120
This is just a minor setback.

7
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,410
No, it's not, okay?

8
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,010
I've been out here for, like, ten years.

9
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,750
I have nothing to show for it.

10
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,670
Well, you have me.

11
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,200
I do have you.

12
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,360
Leonard Hofstadter,

13
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,350
will you marry me?

14
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,950
Did you seriously just say, "Um..."?

15
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,530
- It's an outrage. - I know.

16
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,870
The university-- they think they can do whatever they want.

17
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,530
We just have to sit there and take it.

18
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,730
You need to let it go, Sheldon.

19
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,900
You work tirelessly for someone, and this is what you get.

20
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:45,550
Oh, my God!

21
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,900
They're just making you use your vacation days!

22
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,710
But I don't want a vacation.

23
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,420
Okay, listen, I don't mean to diminish what you're going through,

24
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,340
but I'm a little distracted right now.

25
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,180
Oh, this again?

26
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,820
So, Penny proposed, you didn't say yes,

27
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,940
and now you think you may have lost her love forever.

28
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,910
How does this compare to me being forced

29
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,590
to relax for a few days?

30
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,520
- It doesn't! - Thank you!

31
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm gonna go talk to Penny.

32
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,170
I'm going to go inside, put on my coziest pajamas,

33
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,440
curl up with a good book

34
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,970
and wait for this nightmare to be over.

35
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,800
Penny.

36
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,240
Sorry.

37
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,650
Hey. Look, I'm sorry I didn't text you back.

38
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,080
I just needed some time to think.

39
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,110
- Okay. - Here. Come in.

40
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,140
Look, if you want to break up, just say it.

41
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,620
- Leonard... - No, no, no, no. I take it back.

42
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,840
Don't say it. Just-just hate me, but stay with me.

43
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,930
It worked for my parents.

44
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,560
Listen, I don't want to break up with you.

45
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,140
Oh. O-Okay.

46
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,080
Good, good.

47
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,740
So, it's cool if I cry a little?

48
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,800
Yeah, I probably wouldn't.

49
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,850
Yeah.

50
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,900
Look, you did the right thing last night.

51
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,230
I was a mess.

52
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,680
I was just frustrated because my career is going nowhere.

53
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,670
Look, I get it, and I want you to know

54
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,220
that I support whatever you want to do.

55
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,110
Great, because I've been thinking,

56
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,660
if I really want this acting thing to work,

57
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,780
I need to focus all my energy on it.

58
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,870
And to do that,

59
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,330
I should quit waitressing at The Cheesecake Factory.

60
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,740
- That-That's a big step. - I know.

61
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,850
So, you know, before making any rash...

62
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,820
- I already quit. - And I support you!

63
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,520
- Come on, take me to work with you. - No.

64
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,680
- You're on vacation. - Please.

65
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,320
What if there's a big breakthrough in science today

66
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,720
and I'm not there to see it?

67
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,230
Do you really think there's gonna be a breakthrough

68
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,440
without you there to do it?

69
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,890
No. I was just tricking you.

70
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,440
Bye.

71
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,860
Leonard, wait!

72
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,660
- Take me with you.- No!

73
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,870
- Please. - No!

74
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,220
Too bad. I'm coming with you.

75
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,730
- Oh, Sheldon, stay! - But...

76
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,500
I said stay!

77
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,710
I'm going to work.

78
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,800
Do not follow me.

79
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,600
Hey, Stuart.

80
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,130
- Hey. - Sorry. Did I startle you?

81
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,180
Yes, but at this point, pretty much any customer does.

82
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,610
What can I do for you?

83
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,100
Well, I need a little help.

84
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,860
I accidentally destroyed one of Howard's comic books this morning,

85
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,630
and I was hoping I could replace it.

86
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,060
Wow. What happened?

87
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,280
Batman got his ass kicked by my curling iron.

88
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,290
Well, don't let The Riddler know that.

89
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,100
It's a comic book joke.

90
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,160
Or maybe it's not.

91
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,090
Do you have this one?

92
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,910
Uh, well, it's-it's pretty rare.

93
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,340
Can you give me a few days to track it down?

94
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,560
Ooh, I was kind of hoping to get it

95
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,150
before Howie comes home from work.

96
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,220
Oh. What's the hurry?

97
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,210
Well, he's always saying

98
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,400
I should be more careful with my curling iron,

99
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,740
and it seems like a dangerous precedent

100
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,930
to let him think he can be right.

101
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,740
Well, I'll do what I can,

102
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,310
but I can't make any promises.

103
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,260
You know, I do work at a pharmaceutical company.

104
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,000
If you can make this happen today,

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,500
I can hook you up with anxiety medication,

106
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,310
- antidepressants. - Really?

107
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,790
Do you have any of these?

108
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,230
Hello, Mr. Rat Brain.

109
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,840
Not so bitey without the rest of the rat

110
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,820
to back us up now, are we?

111
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,070
Anybody home?

112
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,100
Hey, what brings you guys here?

113
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,340
Well, we were just on our way to lunch

114
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,590
and wanted to see if you'd like to join.

115
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:33,390
Why?

116
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,650
Because Sheldon's not here this week,

117
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,130
and you don't think I have any other options?

118
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,180
I'm just kidding. I'll get my purse.

119
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,190
Hi, Amy. I... Oh.

120
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,180
I'm sorry. I didn't know you had any company.

121
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,010
That's okay.

122
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,660
Uh, Bert, this is Howard and Rajesh.

123
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,110
Guys, this is Bert.

124
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,260
- Hey. Good to see you. - Hey.

125
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,570
Anyway, I wanted to show you

126
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,540
this tourmalinated quartz that we got in the lab.

127
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,900
This is so pretty.

128
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,530
- Bert works for the geology department. - Yeah.

129
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,700
You know what, uh, geologists and Bon Jovi have in common?

130
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,180
You're both into rock?

131
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,990
Yeah.

132
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,420
Well, see ya.

133
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,570
Oh, you forgot your quartz.

134
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,210
Oh, it's okay.

135
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,210
I want you to have it.

136
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,130
Bye.

137
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,020
He's nice.

138
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,920
Yeah, he's nice because he likes you.

139
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,460
What?! No, he doesn't.

140
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,190
He brought you a pretty rock.

141
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,900
So? He does that every day...Oh.

142
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,920
You know, if you'd rather skip lunch

143
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,670
and hang out with your boyfriend Bert, it's totally okay.

144
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,040
He's not my boyfriend.

145
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,010
Are you sure? He's tall, pale and awkward.

146
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,090
That sounds like your type.

147
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,660
Should someone as lonely as you really be making fun of me?

148
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,090
Yeah, grow up, Howard. God.

149
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,160
What do I do? I don't want to hurt his feelings.

150
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,560
Maybe the problem is he thinks you're available.

151
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,260
Does he know you're dating Sheldon?

152
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,590
I guess it hasn't come up.

153
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,260
There you go.

154
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,130
And does Sheldon know you're dating Sheldon?

155
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:06,170
I'm sorry. Who are you dating?

156
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,490
Yeah, knock it off, Howard!

157
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,390
Hey, Sheldon.

158
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,270
Hello.

159
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,400
You okay?

160
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,820
I'm on vacation. What do you think?

161
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,830
Why are you sitting in the stairwell?

162
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,020
Leonard told me to stay.

163
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,110
Oh. Well, good boy.

164
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,530
Where are you going?

165
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,670
Oh, I have a ton of errands to run.

166
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,840
I need to make copies of my headshot,

167
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,920
send them off to agents

168
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,340
and sign up for a new acting class and...

169
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,870
- Well, have fun. - Okay.

170
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,980
- You want to come with me? - Really?

171
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,090
Come on, boy. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

172
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,960
Get in the car. Come on.

173
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,300
All right, thanks a lot.

174
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,970
They have one at Capital Comics.

175
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,970
- Oh, that's great. - No, it's not.

176
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,540
I hate that place.

177
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,610
Guy who owns it is a jerk.

178
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,910
He's always making me feel bad about myself.

179
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,610
Oh, that's terrible.

180
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,360
What's the address?

181
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,810
You know, why don't I just take you there?

182
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,590
That way, I can make sure he doesn't rip you off.

183
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,510
Oh, thanks, but I don't want you to close up.

184
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,700
I mean, won't you lose business?

185
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,470
Sorry. That was mean.

186
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,500
- Penny really quit The Cheesecake Factory? - Yeah.

187
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,840
- So, what is she doing today? - I don't know.

188
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,300
She already thinks I don't support this,

189
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,780
so if I call, it might look like I'm checking up on her.

190
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,960
Well, do you support this?

191
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,230
Of course I do.

192
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,570
She's a great actress.

193
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,480
I'm proud she's taking this risk.

194
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,410
That's nice.

195
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,900
You bought that? Great!

196
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,300
I got to call her before I forget how I said it.

197
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,020
Hi. What's up?

198
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,790
Oh, how's it going?

199
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,230
You taking Hollywood by storm?

200
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,870
Actually, I'm at The Cheesecake Factory.

201
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,290
You got your job back. That is great news.

202
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,800
I didn't want to say anything,

203
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,420
but you are making the right choice.

204
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,750
To plunge yourself into debt right now

205
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,000
- would be literally insane. Yeah.

206
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,560
I'm just returning my uniform.

207
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,920
And I support you.

208
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,940
Before we begin your guided meditation,

209
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,800
close your eyes

210
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,300
and picture yourself in a peaceful environment.

211
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,320
Okay.

212
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:55,090
I'm inside the CERN super collider.

213
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:59,330
Now, take a deep, relaxing breath in through your nose.

214
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,890
And let it out.

215
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,690
Didn't see that coming.

216
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,290
In.

217
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,400
Let me guess.

218
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,160
And out.

219
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,190
What was I gonna do? Two "ins" in a row?

220
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,720
Where's my lemonade?

221
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,390
I didn't get it.

222
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,490
A fitting swan song to your career as a waitress

223
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:30,440
to forget my order one last time.

224
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,880
Do you think quitting my job was a mistake?

225
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,470
Do you see me drinking lemonade?

226
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,920
No. I'm serious.

227
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,940
Why do you ask?

228
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,210
Because Leonard just pissed me off.

229
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,380
Am I being an idiot or not?

230
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,850
No, I don't think you are.

231
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,210
Really?

232
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,150
The best way to achieve a goal is to devote 100%

233
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,510
of your time and energy to it.

234
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,650
When I decided I was going to be a physicist,

235
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,190
I didn't take some other job

236
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,110
in case it didn't work out.

237
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,130
Which wasn't easy because there was a lot of pressure

238
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:11,500
from Ms. Pierson for me to be chalk monitor that year.

239
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,270
Thank you. I needed to hear that.

240
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,700
Why can't Leonard understand it?

241
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,680
Because he's not like us, Penny.

242
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,530
We're dreamers.

243
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,870
Yeah, I need to start cracking the window

244
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,000
when I leave you in the car.

245
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,520
Hello, Bert.

246
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,080
So, anyway, there's this big, uh, rock and mineral show

247
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,350
next week in Santa Monica and...

248
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,030
Listen, um, Bert,

249
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,820
before you say anything else, I...

250
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,000
I have a boyfriend.

251
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,540
This is awkward.

252
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,290
You thought I was gonna ask you to go with me

253
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:57,940
to the mineral show. - Weren't you?

254
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,940
Yeah.

255
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,970
That's very nice of you, but...

256
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,000
I do have a boyfriend.

257
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,660
That's what you all say.

258
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,860
You just don't want to go out with me

259
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,020
because I have an off-putting personality.

260
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,700
No, that's not true.

261
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,230
My boyfriend has an off-putting personality, too.

262
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,420
Like, way worse than you.

263
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,460
Don't worry.

264
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,590
I'm used to it.

265
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:25,270
I mean, I'm big and weird and funny-looking

266
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,910
and no one ever wants to do anything with me.

267
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,330
Don't say that.

268
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:31,870
It's okay.

269
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,650
I know I'm a monster.

270
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,010
No, Bert, come on.

271
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,120
I'd love to go to the mineral show with you.

272
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,110
Sweet.

273
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,000
It's a date.

274
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,790
No, it's not.

275
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,440
Too late!

276
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,240
Yeah. Haven't seen this many people in my store

277
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,800
since that Korean church bus

278
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,970
crashed through my front window.

279
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,650
Hey! Stuart!

280
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:08,590
Jesse.

281
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,430
Haven't seen you in forever.

282
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,080
Look how gray you've gotten.

283
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,390
My hair's exactly the same color as always.

284
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,950
No, I was talking about your skin.

285
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,270
Look, uh, my friend here needs a comic book...

286
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,900
And she went into your store by mistake.

287
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,450
Good thing there was no one there to see you.

288
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,330
What do you need?

289
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,470
Oh, yeah, yeah. I got this.

290
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,290
Right over here.

291
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,320
Even you, Sweatpants?

292
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,600
Free popcorn.

293
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,440
Can I offer you a coffee?

294
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,930
Espresso? Latte?

295
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:42,650
No, thanks.

296
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,830
How about you, Stu? Mocha? Scone?

297
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:48,330
Directions to the nearest soup kitchen?

298
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,670
He knows where the soup kitchen is.

299
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,650
It's on Merton Avenue.

300
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,390
I don't think I like the way you're treating my friend.

301
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,810
Sorry.

302
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,330
You want the book or not?

303
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,660
Not from you.

304
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,730
Let's go, Stuart.

305
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,550
You know something, Jesse?

306
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,810
You may have a successful business

307
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,670
a-and the kind of pink complexion

308
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,860
that comes with good nutrition...

309
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,880
...but I have something more important.

310
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,450
What's that?

311
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:25,490
Friendship.

312
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,360
Which I would trade in a heartbeat for all of this.

313
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,770
The mineral and rock show?

314
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:39,090
That would be awful even without Bert.

315
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,700
So what am I supposed to do now?

316
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,280
Prepare your uterus for his gigantic offspring?

317
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,090
This isn't funny.

318
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,410
I'm gonna have to tell him the truth:

319
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,950
that even if I didn't have a boyfriend,

320
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,530
I wouldn't be interested in him.

321
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,700
I've heard those words so many times.

322
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,890
From Linda Nosenchuck, Tammy Rosenworcel...

323
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,710
Padma Kapur, Neha Chowdury...

324
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,450
...Marci Grossman, Lisa Mazzarino...

325
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,300
- ...Megan Pincus... - ...Tammy Cho...

326
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,620
Oh, who was that girl from our Starbucks?

327
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,600
- Arlene Russel! - Yes! Arlene!

328
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,840
She wrote "no way" on both our cappuccinos.

329
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,050
Poor Bert.

330
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,680
That guy's got a rough afternoon ahead of him.

331
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,570
Well, how would you want a girl

332
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,570
to tell you she wasn't interested?

333
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:23,510
I guess, uh, I'd like her to sit me down,

334
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,640
look me in the eye and say,

335
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,380
"I was wrong. I love you."

336
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:32,040
And then maybe she could touch me in a special way.

337
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,750
That's how you reject a guy.

338
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,240
Okay, I don't have time for this.

339
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,790
I'm just gonna go find him and be brutally honest.

340
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,450
- No, don't. - He'll be so upset.

341
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,950
He'll probably climb up the Empire State Building

342
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,020
and start swatting at planes.

343
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,000
You want us to talk to him?

344
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,040
Really?

345
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,620
- You would do that? - Sure.

346
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,760
We've both been in his shoes.

347
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,730
We'll let him down with compassion and respect.

348
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,390
Thank you.

349
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,430
Let's go.

350
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,370
So we tell him she's a lesbian, right?

351
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,790
Of course we tell him she's a lesbian.

352
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,840
And hold three...

353
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,680
two... one.

354
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,620
Very good.

355
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,170
Now let's try Warrior II.

356
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,180
And hold.

357
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,710
I've read that there are great yogis

358
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:36,080
who have such mastery over their bodies

359
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,890
they can draw water in through their genitals.

360
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,770
Yeah, well, I don't think we're gonna get to do that today.

361
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,070
Too bad.

362
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,730
It seems like a good way to drink a milk shake

363
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,290
without getting brain freeze.

364
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:05,180
And now we go to Reverse Warrior.

365
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,660
How did she get you to do yoga?

366
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,920
Well, to be honest, I thought she said "Yoda."

367
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,230
I'm helping him relax because, unlike you,

368
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,730
he supports me.

369
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,740
Oh, how many times do I have to say it?

370
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,370
I support you.

371
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:27,880
Sheldon, take a break.

372
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,790
Namaste.

373
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,900
Okay, if you support me, what was with that phone call?

374
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,460
Fine. I'm not sure you should have quit.

375
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,910
But if you care so much what I think,

376
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,610
why didn't you ask me before you did it?

377
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,200
Oh, so now I need your permission?

378
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,720
Would you have asked me before you quit your job?

379
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,690
Yes.

380
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,220
I thought we were in the kind of relationship

381
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,570
where we make decisions together.

382
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,190
If I'm wrong, then maybe we need to talk about

383
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,010
the kind of relationship we're actually in.

384
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,440
Yeah, well, maybe we do.

385
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,820
I'm willing to if you guys are.

386
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,970
Can we please have some privacy?

387
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,230
Y... No.

388
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:02,430
I'm as much a part of this relationship as you two,

389
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:05,160
and I think it's high time we put all our cards on the table.

390
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,620
Yeah. For example, where is this going?

391
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,610
Are you two ever getting married?

392
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,690
And, if so, where will we all live?

393
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,990
Have you thought about that?

394
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,880
- No. - Penny?

395
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,370
Okay, wait. What are we doing?

396
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,420
For some reason, we're planning a future

397
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,510
where we both live with Sheldon forever.

398
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:24,660
Good. Now we're getting somewhere.

399
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,780
Look, I know you think I'm being reckless,

400
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,670
and you might be right,

401
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,140
but I need to take this shot.

402
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,230
Yeah, no kidding.

403
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,000
Despite what it says on her resume,

404
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,500
she is no longer 22.

405
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,130
I swear, I am on your side.

406
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,680
You keep saying you're on my side,

407
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,970
- but you don't act like it. - He does that to me, too.

408
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:46,560
Why do we put up with it?

409
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,580
Listen, I could never do what you're doing, okay?

410
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,270
I would be terrified.

411
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,690
Well, it's scary for me, too.

412
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,630
I'm fine with it.

413
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,780
My point is, just because I couldn't do it

414
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,150
doesn't mean you shouldn't.

415
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:04,180
And I'm proud of you.

416
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:08,740
Okay. Thank you.

417
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,610
Well, to celebrate this reconciliation,

418
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:12,400
let's all share a milk shake.

419
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,220
Uh, Penny, you'll need a straw.

420
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,700
- You're back. - Yes, I am!

421
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,360
There's a few more things I want to say to you.

422
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,040
Stuart's store is just fine,

423
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,670
and he's a much nicer person than you are,

424
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,810
and if you still have that comic,

425
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:31,530
I'd like to buy it right now!

426
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,450
No problem.

427
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,660
Oh, you want a latte while you wait?

428
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,640
No, I don't want a latte!

429
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,830
I want a cappuccino and a blueberry scone!

430
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,680
I only have chocolate chip.

431
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,870
Well, that sounds even better!

432
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,740
Thanks for coming to the mineral and rock show with me.

433
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:04,870
We're sorry Amy didn't want to go.

434
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:08,450
Really, really sorry.

435
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,800
Who needs her when I have you guys?

436
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,700
Rock show!

437
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,410
Rock show! Rock show!

438
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,470
Rock show! Rock show!

439
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,380
Rock show!

440
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,650
Rock show...!
