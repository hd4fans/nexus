生活大爆炸
第七季  第十三集

11
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:03,020
《生活大爆炸》前情回顧
Previously on The Big Bang Theory:

12
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,120
這只是一點小挫折
This is just a minor setback.

13
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,410
這不是  明白嗎 
No, it's not, okay?

14
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,010
我已經離家拼搏十年了  
I've been out here for, like, ten years.

15
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,750
我依然一無所有
I have nothing to show for it.

16
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,670
你有我啊
Well, you have me.

17
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,200
我的確擁有你
I do have you.

18
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,360
萊納德·霍夫斯塔德
Leonard Hofstadter,

19
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,350
你愿意娶我嗎
will you marry me?

20
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,950
你剛才那一聲是在猶豫嗎
Did you seriously just say, "Um..."?

21
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,990
事到如今

22
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,530
-這太過分了  -我明白
- It's an outrage. - I know.

23
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,870
大學的高層覺得他們想干嘛就能干嘛
The university-- they think they can do whatever they want.

24
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,530
我們只能乖乖任由擺布
We just have to sit there and take it.

25
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,730
別老拽著這事不放了  謝爾頓
You need to let it go, Sheldon.

26
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,900
我沒日沒夜地為他們干活  卻落得如此下場
You work tirelessly for someone, and this is what you get.

27
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:45,550
我的老天啊
Oh, my God!

28
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,900
他們就是讓你把年假用掉而已
They're just making you use your vacation days!

29
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,710
可我不想放假
But I don't want a vacation.

30
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,420
我不想輕視你心靈受到的創傷
Okay, listen, I don't mean to diminish what you're going through,

31
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,340
但我現在真的沒心思
but I'm a little distracted right now.

32
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,180
又是因為那事啊
Oh, this again?

33
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,820
不就是佩妮求了婚  你沒答應嘛
So, Penny proposed, you didn't say yes,

34
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,940
所以現在你天天發愁到底會不會失去她
and now you think you may have lost her love forever.

35
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,910
這破事怎么比得上我被人
How does this compare to me being forced

36
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,590
逼迫放假來得慘啊
to relax for a few days?

37
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,520
-完全比不上  -就是嘛
- It doesn't! - Thank you!

38
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,000
我要去跟佩妮談談
I'm gonna go talk to Penny.

39
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,170
我要回家穿上我最舒服的睡衣
I'm going to go inside, put on my coziest pajamas,

40
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,440
蜷在床上看本好書
curl up with a good book

41
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,970
等待這場噩夢的結束
and wait for this nightmare to be over.

42
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,800
佩妮
Penny.

43
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,240
抱歉  情不自禁
Sorry.

44
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,650
抱歉沒回你短信
Hey. Look, I'm sorry I didn't text you back.

45
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,080
我只是需要點時間想想
I just needed some time to think.

46
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,110
-沒事  -來  進來吧
- Okay. - Here. Come in.

47
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,140
如果你是想要分手  就說出來吧
Look, if you want to break up, just say it.

48
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,620
-萊納德...  -別別別  我收回那句話
- Leonard... - No, no, no, no. I take it back.

49
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,840
千萬別分手  恨我就好  別離開我
Don't say it. Just-just hate me, but stay with me.

50
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,930
反正我爸媽也這樣
It worked for my parents.

51
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,560
聽我說  我沒想要跟你分手
Listen, I don't want to break up with you.

52
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,140
那就好
Oh. O-Okay.

53
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,080
很好  很好
Good, good.

54
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,740
不介意我落兩滴男兒淚吧
So, it's cool if I cry a little?

55
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,800
要我就不會這么做
Yeah, I probably wouldn't.

56
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,850
同意
Yeah.

57
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,900
你昨晚的做法是正確的
Look, you did the right thing last night.

58
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,230
我當時腦子不清楚
I was a mess.

59
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,680
當時我因為事業不順  內心嚴重受挫
I was just frustrated because my career is going nowhere.

60
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,670
我理解  我也想你知道
Look, I get it, and I want you to know

61
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,220
無論你想做什么事  我都支持你
that I support whatever you want to do.

62
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,110
那就好  因為我在想
Great, because I've been thinking,

63
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,660
如果我真想要演員事業能成功
if I really want this acting thing to work,

64
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,780
我就得身心完全投入
I need to focus all my energy on it.

65
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,870
為了做到真正投入
And to do that,

66
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,330
我決定辭芝士蛋糕工廠的服務員工作
I should quit waitressing at The Cheesecake Factory.

67
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,740
-這是個大改變啊  -我知道
- That-That's a big step. - I know.

68
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,850
所以在你做任何沖動的...
So, you know, before making any rash...

69
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,820
-我已經辭職了  -那我也支持你
- I already quit. - And I support you!

70
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,520
-好嘛  帶我跟你去上班  -不行
- Come on, take me to work with you. - No.

71
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,680
-你在放假  -求你了
- You're on vacation. - Please.

72
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,320
萬一今天科學界有重大突破
What if there's a big breakthrough in science today

73
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,720
我卻錯過無法見證呢
and I'm not there to see it?

74
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,230
你真的覺得你如果不在  科學界能有什么
Do you really think there's gonna be a breakthrough

75
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,440
重大突破嗎
without you there to do it?

76
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,890
當然不會有  這是陷阱題
No. I was just tricking you.

77
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,440
再會
Bye.

78
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,860
萊納德  等等
Leonard, wait!

79
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,660
-帶我一起去  -不行
- Take me with you.- No!

80
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,870
-求你了  -就是不行
- Please. - No!

81
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,220
抱歉  我就是要跟著你
Too bad. I'm coming with you.

82
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,730
-謝爾頓  停  -但是...
- Oh, Sheldon, stay! - But...

83
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,500
乖乖待著
I said stay!

84
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,710
我要去上班了
I'm going to work.

85
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,800
不許跟著我
Do not follow me.

86
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,600
斯圖爾特
Hey, Stuart.

87
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,130
-你好啊  -抱歉  我嚇到你了嗎
- Hey. - Sorry. Did I startle you?

88
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,180
沒關系  這時間所有客人都會嚇到我
Yes, but at this point, pretty much any customer does.

89
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,610
你要買什么
What can I do for you?

90
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,100
我需要你幫個忙
Well, I need a little help.

91
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,860
今早我不小心弄壞了霍華德的一本漫畫書
I accidentally destroyed one of Howard's comic books this morning,

92
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,630
所以我想買一本來替換
and I was hoping I could replace it.

93
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,060
發生了什么事
Wow. What happened?

94
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,280
蝙蝠俠被我的燙發棒給虐了
Batman got his ass kicked by my curling iron.

95
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,290
可別把這個秘密告訴謎語人
Well, don't let The Riddler know that.

96
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,290
蝙蝠俠敵手

97
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,100
這是個漫畫哏啦
It's a comic book joke.

98
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,160
也可能不是哏吧
Or maybe it's not.

99
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,090
你還有這本書嗎
Do you have this one?

100
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,910
這本書市面上很少見了
Uh, well, it's-it's pretty rare.

101
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,340
我需要幾天時間找一下
Can you give me a few days to track it down?

102
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,560
我還希望能在華仔下班
Ooh, I was kind of hoping to get it

103
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,150
回家之前就把書換掉
before Howie comes home from work.

104
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,220
干嘛這么著急
Oh. What's the hurry?

105
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,210
他平時就愛念叨
Well, he's always saying

106
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,400
讓我用燙發棒的時候多注意點
I should be more careful with my curling iron,

107
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,740
要是讓他發現
and it seems like a dangerous precedent

108
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,930
他也有說對的時候就慘了
to let him think he can be right.

109
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,740
我盡力而為吧
Well, I'll do what I can,

110
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,310
但我可不敢打包票一定能找到
but I can't make any promises.

111
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,260
其實我在制藥公司工作呢
You know, I do work at a pharmaceutical company.

112
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,000
如果你今天能幫我找到書
If you can make this happen today,

113
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,500
我就能幫你搞點抗焦慮
I can hook you up with anxiety medication,

114
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,310
-和抗抑郁的藥  -是嗎
- antidepressants. - Really?

115
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,790
那你有這些藥嗎
Do you have any of these?

116
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,230
鼠腦君  你好嗎
Hello, Mr. Rat Brain.

117
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,840
沒了身體的其他部分  
Not so bitey without the rest of the rat

118
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,820
現在沒法咬我了吧
to back us up now, are we?

119
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,070
有人嗎
Anybody home?

120
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,100
你倆來干什么
Hey, what brings you guys here?

121
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,340
我們要去吃午飯
Well, we were just on our way to lunch

122
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,590
順道看看你想不想一起去
and wanted to see if you'd like to join.

123
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:33,390
為什么
Why?

124
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,650
因為這周謝爾頓不上班
Because Sheldon's not here this week,

125
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,130
你們就覺得我沒有別人陪伴了嗎
and you don't think I have any other options?

126
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,180
開玩笑的  我拿上包就走
I'm just kidding. I'll get my purse.

127
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,190
艾米  我
Hi, Amy. I... Oh.

128
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,180
抱歉  我不知道你有客人在
I'm sorry. I didn't know you had any company.

129
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,010
沒關系
That's okay.

130
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,660
伯特  這是霍華德和拉杰什
Uh, Bert, this is Howard and Rajesh.

131
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,110
這位是Bert
Guys, this is Bert.

132
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,260
-很高興見到你  -你好
- Hey. Good to see you. - Hey.

133
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,570
我是想過來給你看看
Anyway, I wanted to show you

134
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,540
我們在實驗室弄出來的石英晶體
this tourmalinated quartz that we got in the lab.

135
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,900
真漂亮
This is so pretty.

136
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,530
-伯特在地質系工作  -沒錯
- Bert works for the geology department. - Yeah.

137
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,700
你們知道地質學家和邦·喬飛的共同點是什么嗎
You know what, uh, geologists and Bon Jovi have in common?

138
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,180
你們都喜歡石頭[搖滾]嗎
You're both into rock?

139
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,990
答對了
Yeah.

140
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,420
再見
Well, see ya.

141
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,570
你忘了把石英拿走了
Oh, you forgot your quartz.

142
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,210
沒關系
Oh, it's okay.

143
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,210
送給你吧
I want you to have it.

144
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,130
再見
Bye.

145
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,020
他人真好
He's nice.

146
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,920
他對你好是因為他喜歡你
Yeah, he's nice because he likes you.

147
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,460
什么呀  他才不喜歡我呢
What?! No, he doesn't.

148
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,190
他送你一塊漂亮的石頭
He brought you a pretty rock.

149
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,900
那又怎樣  他每天都送我...
So? He does that every day...Oh.

150
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,920
如果你不想吃午飯
You know, if you'd rather skip lunch

151
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,670
而想和你男友伯特在一起  我們完全沒意見
and hang out with your boyfriend Bert, it's totally okay.

152
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,040
他才不是我男朋友呢
He's not my boyfriend.

153
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,010
你確定嗎  他個高  膚白  人怪
Are you sure? He's tall, pale and awkward.

154
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,090
貌似就是你的菜啊
That sounds like your type.

155
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,660
你這種萬年沒人愛的家伙也敢來取笑我嗎
Should someone as lonely as you really be making fun of me?

156
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,090
沒錯  霍華德  你成熟點好不好
Yeah, grow up, Howard. God.

157
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,160
我該怎么做呢  我不想傷害他的感情
What do I do? I don't want to hurt his feelings.

158
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,560
也許問題就出在他不知道你名花有主了
Maybe the problem is he thinks you're available.

159
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,260
他知道你在跟謝爾頓談戀愛嗎
Does he know you're dating Sheldon?

160
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,590
好像從沒提過這事
I guess it hasn't come up.

161
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,260
看吧
There you go.

162
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,130
那謝爾頓知道你們倆是算在談戀愛嗎
And does Sheldon know you're dating Sheldon?

163
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:06,170
不好意思  那你又是跟誰在戀愛
I'm sorry. Who are you dating?

164
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,490
就是  把嘴閉上  霍華德
Yeah, knock it off, Howard!

165
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,390
謝爾頓
Hey, Sheldon.

166
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,270
你好
Hello.

167
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,400
你沒事吧
You okay?

168
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,820
我在上班  你覺得呢
I'm on vacation. What do you think?

169
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,830
那你為什么坐在樓梯上
Why are you sitting in the stairwell?

170
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,020
萊納德讓我待在這
Leonard told me to stay.

171
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,110
真聽話  乖孩子[狗狗]
Oh. Well, good boy.

172
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,530
你要去哪里
Where are you going?

173
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,670
我要出去辦一堆事
Oh, I have a ton of errands to run.

174
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,840
我得去多洗幾張我的大頭照
I need to make copies of my headshot,

175
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,920
寄給不同的經濟人
send them off to agents

176
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,340
然后去報一門新的表演課
and sign up for a new acting class and...

177
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,870
-祝你忙得開心  -好的
- Well, have fun. - Okay.

178
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,980
-你要不要一起來  -可以嗎
- You want to come with me? - Really?

179
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,090
當然可以  走吧  快  乖孩子[狗狗]
Come on, boy. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

180
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,960
快上車  走
Get in the car. Come on.

181
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,300
謝天謝地
All right, thanks a lot.

182
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,970
首都漫畫店有一本
They have one at Capital Comics.

183
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,970
-那太棒了  -才不是
- Oh, that's great. - No, it's not.

184
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,540
我討厭那地方
I hate that place.

185
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,610
那個店主就是一個混蛋
Guy who owns it is a jerk.

186
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,910
他總愛讓我產生強烈的自卑感
He's always making me feel bad about myself.

187
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,610
太糟糕了
Oh, that's terrible.

188
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,360
那家店在哪里
What's the address?

189
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,810
算了  要不我帶你去吧
You know, why don't I just take you there?

190
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,590
這樣我能確保他不會趁機敲詐
That way, I can make sure he doesn't rip you off.

191
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,510
多謝啦  但我不希望你關門
Oh, thanks, but I don't want you to close up.

192
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,700
你會損失客人的
I mean, won't you lose business?

193
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,470
抱歉  這話太損了
Sorry. That was mean.

194
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,500
-佩妮真的辭掉了服務員的工作嗎  -是的
- Penny really quit The Cheesecake Factory? - Yeah.

195
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,840
-那她今天干什么  -我不知道
- So, what is she doing today? - I don't know.

196
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,300
她已經認為我在這方面不支持她
She already thinks I don't support this,

197
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,780
所以如果我打給她  就會像查崗一樣
so if I call, it might look like I'm checking up on her.

198
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,960
那你支持她嗎
Well, do you support this?

199
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,230
當然支持
Of course I do.

200
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,570
她是一名很棒的女演員
She's a great actress.

201
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,480
她敢冒這個險  真讓我感到驕傲
I'm proud she's taking this risk.

202
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,410
你真貼心
That's nice.

203
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,900
你還真信啊  太棒了
You bought that? Great!

204
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,300
我要在忘記怎么演之前  趕快打給佩妮
I got to call her before I forget how I said it.

205
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,020
怎么了
Hi. What's up?

206
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,790
進展如何
Oh, how's it going?

207
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,230
你有沒有襲卷好萊塢啊
You taking Hollywood by storm?

208
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,870
其實我現在在芝士蛋糕工廠呢
Actually, I'm at The Cheesecake Factory.

209
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,290
你要回工作啦  那真是太好了
You got your job back. That is great news.

210
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,800
我本來不想多說什么
I didn't want to say anything,

211
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,420
但你這么做才是正確的
but you are making the right choice.

212
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,750
現在就切斷自己的經濟來源
To plunge yourself into debt right now

213
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,000
-簡直就是瘋了嘛  -是啊
- would be literally insane. Yeah.

214
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,560
我是來這還工作服的
I'm just returning my uniform.

215
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,920
對了  我支持你哦
And I support you.

216
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,940
在開始接受冥想引導前
Before we begin your guided meditation,

217
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,800
閉上眼
close your eyes

218
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,300
想象自己處于一個平和安詳的環境
and picture yourself in a peaceful environment.

219
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,320
好的
Okay.

220
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:55,090
我處于歐洲核子研究中心的超級對撞機里
I'm inside the CERN super collider.

221
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:59,330
現在用鼻子輕松地深吸一口氣
Now, take a deep, relaxing breath in through your nose.

222
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,890
然后呼氣
And let it out.

223
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,690
真是"沒想到"啊
Didn't see that coming.

224
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,290
吸氣
In.

225
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,400
下一步肯定是...
Let me guess.

226
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,160
呼氣
And out.

227
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,190
不然咧  連吸兩口氣憋死自己嗎
What was I gonna do? Two "ins" in a row?

228
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,720
我的檸檬汁呢
Where's my lemonade?

229
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,390
我忘了
I didn't get it.

230
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,490
告別你服務員職業生涯的最佳方式
A fitting swan song to your career as a waitress

231
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:30,440
就是最后一次忘記我的點單
to forget my order one last time.

232
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,880
你認為我辭職是個錯誤嗎
Do you think quitting my job was a mistake?

233
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,470
你有看到我在喝檸檬汁嗎
Do you see me drinking lemonade?

234
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,920
我是說真的
No. I'm serious.

235
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,940
干嘛這么問
Why do you ask?

236
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,210
因為萊納德剛剛氣到我了
Because Leonard just pissed me off.

237
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,380
我辭職是不是特傻啊
Am I being an idiot or not?

238
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,850
不啊  我不這么認為
No, I don't think you are.

239
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,210
真的嗎
Really?

240
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,150
達到目標的最好辦法就是投入自己
The best way to achieve a goal is to devote 100%

241
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,510
百分之百的時間和精力
of your time and energy to it.

242
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,650
當我決心要成為一個物理學家時
When I decided I was going to be a physicist,

243
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,190
我沒有隨便找一份工作
I didn't take some other job

244
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,110
好給自己留一條后路
in case it didn't work out.

245
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,130
這決定不容易  因為那年皮爾森老師
Which wasn't easy because there was a lot of pressure

246
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:11,500
不斷對我施壓  讓我當補粉筆專員
from Ms. Pierson for me to be chalk monitor that year.

247
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,270
謝謝  我需要這樣的鼓勵
Thank you. I needed to hear that.

248
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,700
為什么萊納德就是不明白呢
Why can't Leonard understand it?

249
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,680
因為他不像咱倆  佩妮
Because he's not like us, Penny.

250
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,530
我們是夢想家
We're dreamers.

251
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,870
是是  下次再把你留在車里
Yeah, I need to start cracking the window

252
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,000
得留個縫  免得你腦子缺氧了
when I leave you in the car.

253
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,520
你好  伯特
Hello, Bert.

254
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,080
對了  下周在圣塔莫尼卡有個
So, anyway, there's this big, uh, rock and mineral show

255
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,350
大型的巖石礦物展
next week in Santa Monica and...

256
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,030
聽著  伯特
Listen, um, Bert,

257
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,820
在你說出口之前  我想告訴你
before you say anything else, I...

258
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,000
我有男朋友了
I have a boyfriend.

259
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,540
這下尷尬了
This is awkward.

260
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,290
你以為我是邀請你跟我一起
You thought I was gonna ask you to go with me

261
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:57,940
-去看展覽嗎  -難道不是嗎
to the mineral show. - Weren't you?

262
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,940
是的
Yeah.

263
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,970
多謝你的好意  但
That's very nice of you, but...

264
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,000
我的確有男朋友了
I do have a boyfriend.

265
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,660
你們都這么說
That's what you all say.

266
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,860
你們只是不想跟我出去約會
You just don't want to go out with me

267
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,020
因為我是個令人討厭的人
because I have an off-putting personality.

268
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,700
不  不是的
No, that's not true.

269
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,230
我的男朋友也是一個讓人討厭的人
My boyfriend has an off-putting personality, too.

270
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,420
而且比你討厭多了
Like, way worse than you.

271
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,460
別擔心
Don't worry.

272
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,590
我習慣了
I'm used to it.

273
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:25,270
我這么大只  個性古怪  長相奇怪
I mean, I'm big and weird and funny-looking

274
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,910
從來不會有人想跟我一起玩
and no one ever wants to do anything with me.

275
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,330
別那樣說
Don't say that.

276
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:31,870
沒關系
It's okay.

277
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,650
我知道我就是一怪物
I know I'm a monster.

278
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,010
不  伯特  別走
No, Bert, come on.

279
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,120
我很樂意陪你去看礦物展
I'd love to go to the mineral show with you.

280
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,110
太棒了
Sweet.

281
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,000
那就算約會啦
It's a date.

282
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,790
才不算呢
No, it's not.

283
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,440
為時已晚啦
Too late!

284
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,240
自從那輛韓國教堂大巴
Yeah. Haven't seen this many people in my store

285
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,800
從我店前門玻璃撞進來后
since that Korean church bus

286
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,970
我店再也沒有見過那么多人
crashed through my front window.

287
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,650
斯圖爾特
Hey! Stuart!

288
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:08,590
杰西
Jesse.

289
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,430
好久不見
Haven't seen you in forever.

290
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,080
你看你都灰成這樣了
Look how gray you've gotten.

291
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,390
我的頭發一直都是這個顏色
My hair's exactly the same color as always.

292
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,950
不  我是在說你的膚色
No, I was talking about your skin.

293
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,270
我的朋友要找一本漫畫書
Look, uh, my friend here needs a comic book...

294
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,900
她應該是無意走進你的店吧
And she went into your store by mistake.

295
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,450
幸好他家店沒人  不會有人知道你走錯地方
Good thing there was no one there to see you.

296
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,330
你要找什么
What do you need?

297
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,470
這本啊  我這里有
Oh, yeah, yeah. I got this.

298
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,290
就在這邊
Right over here.

299
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,320
運動褲肥仔  連你也拋棄我
Even you, Sweatpants?

300
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,600
這里有免費爆米花呢
Free popcorn.

301
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,440
要不要來一杯咖啡
Can I offer you a coffee?

302
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,930
是濃縮咖啡還是拿鐵呢
Espresso? Latte?

303
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:42,650
不用了  謝謝
No, thanks.

304
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,830
你呢  斯圖  摩卡還是司康餅
How about you, Stu? Mocha? Scone?

305
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:48,330
還是要這附近施舍處的地址啊
Directions to the nearest soup kitchen?

306
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,670
他知道施舍處在哪
He knows where the soup kitchen is.

307
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,650
在默頓大道上
It's on Merton Avenue.

308
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,390
我不喜歡你這樣對待我的朋友
I don't think I like the way you're treating my friend.

309
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,810
抱歉
Sorry.

310
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,330
你還想不想要這本書了
You want the book or not?

311
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,660
想要也不買你的
Not from you.

312
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,730
我們走  斯圖爾特
Let's go, Stuart.

313
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,550
你知道嗎  杰西
You know something, Jesse?

314
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,810
雖說你生意興隆
You may have a successful business

315
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,670
均衡營養
a-and the kind of pink complexion

316
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,860
養得一臉粉嫩
that comes with good nutrition...

317
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,880
但我擁有更重要的東西
...but I have something more important.

318
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,450
是什么
What's that?

319
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:25,490
友誼
Friendship.

320
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,360
但我會毫不猶豫放棄友誼來換取這一切
Which I would trade in a heartbeat for all of this.

321
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,770
礦物巖石展覽
The mineral and rock show?

322
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:39,090
即使不跟伯特去  聽著都很沒勁
That would be awful even without Bert.

323
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,700
那我現在應該怎么辦
So what am I supposed to do now?

324
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,280
讓你的子宮為他的巨人嬰兒做好準備
Prepare your uterus for his gigantic offspring?

325
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,090
不許拿這事開玩笑
This isn't funny.

326
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,410
我必須跟他說實話
I'm gonna have to tell him the truth:

327
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,950
就算我沒有男友
that even if I didn't have a boyfriend,

328
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,530
也不會喜歡他
I wouldn't be interested in him.

329
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,700
這話我聽過太多遍了
I've heard those words so many times.

330
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,890
琳達·諾森恰克  譚米·羅森沃塞爾
From Linda Nosenchuck, Tammy Rosenworcel...

331
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,710
帕德瑪·卡普爾  內哈·恰德瑞  
Padma Kapur, Neha Chowdury...

332
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,450
馬茜·格羅斯曼  莉薩·馬扎里諾
...Marci Grossman, Lisa Mazzarino...

333
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,300
-梅根·平卡斯  -譚米·周
- ...Megan Pincus... - ...Tammy Cho...

334
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,620
我們常去那家星巴克的女生叫什么來著
Oh, who was that girl from our Starbucks?

335
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,600
-艾琳·羅素  -沒錯  艾琳
- Arlene Russel! - Yes! Arlene!

336
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,840
她在我倆的卡布奇諾杯上  都寫上了"不可能"
She wrote "no way" on both our cappuccinos.

337
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,050
可憐的伯特
Poor Bert.

338
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,680
有一個悲催的下午在等著他
That guy's got a rough afternoon ahead of him.

339
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,570
你們希望一個女生
Well, how would you want a girl

340
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,570
如何拒絕你們
to tell you she wasn't interested?

341
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:23,510
我希望她和我好好坐著
I guess, uh, I'd like her to sit me down,

342
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,640
看著我的眼睛說
look me in the eye and say,

343
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,380
"我錯了  我愛你"
"I was wrong. I love you."

344
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:32,040
或許再用上特別的方式愛撫我
And then maybe she could touch me in a special way.

345
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,750
沒錯  拒絕男生就要這樣
That's how you reject a guy.

346
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,240
我沒時間聽你倆瞎掰
Okay, I don't have time for this.

347
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,790
我要直接去找他  殘忍地說出真相算了
I'm just gonna go find him and be brutally honest.

348
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,450
-別這樣  -他會很傷心的
- No, don't. - He'll be so upset.

349
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,950
他很可能會爬上帝國大廈  
He'll probably climb up the Empire State Building

350
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,020
像電影里的金剛一樣亂拍飛機泄憤
and start swatting at planes.

351
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,000
要我們幫你說嗎
You want us to talk to him?

352
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,040
可以嗎
Really?

353
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,620
-你們愿意代勞嗎  -當然
- You would do that? - Sure.

354
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,760
我們都曾有過這樣的經歷
We've both been in his shoes.

355
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,730
我們會讓他失望的同時  感覺到同情與尊重
We'll let him down with compassion and respect.

356
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,390
謝謝
Thank you.

357
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,430
我們走
Let's go.

358
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,370
跟他說她是拉拉嗎
So we tell him she's a lesbian, right?

359
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,790
當然是說她是拉拉啦
Of course we tell him she's a lesbian.

360
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,840
保持三
And hold three...

361
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,680
二  一
two... one.

362
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,620
非常好
Very good.

363
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,170
現在試試戰士二式
Now let's try Warrior II.

364
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,180
保持
And hold.

365
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,710
有報道指出有些偉大的瑜伽修行者  
I've read that there are great yogis

366
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:36,080
可以隨心所欲掌控自己的身體  
who have such mastery over their bodies

367
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,890
他們能通過生殖器汲水
they can draw water in through their genitals.

368
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,770
我們今天還不會練到這一層次
Yeah, well, I don't think we're gonna get to do that today.

369
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,070
太遺憾了
Too bad.

370
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,730
感覺用這種辦法喝奶昔不錯
It seems like a good way to drink a milk shake

371
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,290
至少大腦不會冰到痛
without getting brain freeze.

372
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:05,180
現在是反轉戰士式
And now we go to Reverse Warrior.

373
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,660
她是怎么說服你做瑜伽的
How did she get you to do yoga?

374
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,920
說實話  我以為她說的是"尤達"
Well, to be honest, I thought she said "Yoda."

375
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,920
《星戰》里的大師  音似瑜伽

376
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,230
我在幫他放松  因為他和你不同  
I'm helping him relax because, unlike you,

377
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,730
他支持我
he supports me.

378
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,740
究竟要我說多少次啊
Oh, how many times do I have to say it?

379
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,370
我支持你
I support you.

380
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:27,880
謝爾頓  休息下
Sheldon, take a break.

381
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,790
合十致敬
Namaste.

382
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,900
如果你支持我  那通電話是什么意思
Okay, if you support me, what was with that phone call?

383
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,460
好吧  我不確定你是否該辭職
Fine. I'm not sure you should have quit.

384
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,910
但如果你這么在乎我的想法
But if you care so much what I think,

385
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,610
你為什么不在辭職前問我呢
why didn't you ask me before you did it?

386
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,200
所以現在我做事需要你的批準嗎
Oh, so now I need your permission?

387
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,720
你在辭職前會征求我的意見嗎 
Would you have asked me before you quit your job?

388
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,690
當然會
Yes.

389
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,220
我覺得我們的關系已經到了
I thought we were in the kind of relationship

390
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,570
什么事都一起做決定的階段
where we make decisions together.

391
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,190
如果我錯了  那也許我們應該談談
If I'm wrong, then maybe we need to talk about

392
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,010
我們的關系究竟在哪一階段
the kind of relationship we're actually in.

393
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,440
也許是需要談談了
Yeah, well, maybe we do.

394
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,820
你們想談的話  我也很樂意談
I'm willing to if you guys are.

395
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,970
給我們一些空間好嗎
Can we please have some privacy?

396
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,230
不行
Y... No.

397
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:02,430
除了你們倆  我也是這段關系的一名成員
I'm as much a part of this relationship as you two,

398
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:05,160
我覺得是時候大家把話說開了
and I think it's high time we put all our cards on the table.

399
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,620
比如  這段感情的未來在哪里
Yeah. For example, where is this going?

400
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,610
你們到底會不會結婚
Are you two ever getting married?

401
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,690
還有婚后  我們仨要住在哪里
And, if so, where will we all live?

402
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,990
你們有考慮這個問題嗎
Have you thought about that?

403
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,880
-沒有  -佩妮呢
- No. - Penny?

404
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,370
慢著  我們這是在干嘛
Okay, wait. What are we doing?

405
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,420
不知為何  我們現在談的是
For some reason, we're planning a future

406
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,510
我們與謝爾頓永遠住在一起的未來
where we both live with Sheldon forever.

407
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:24,660
很好  總算有點進展了
Good. Now we're getting somewhere.

408
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,780
我知道你覺得我太過魯莽  
Look, I know you think I'm being reckless,

409
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,670
也許你是對的
and you might be right,

410
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,140
但我需要把握這次機會
but I need to take this shot.

411
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,230
對  這是說真的
Yeah, no kidding.

412
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,000
盡管她在簡歷上造假
Despite what it says on her resume,

413
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,500
她早就不是22歲了
she is no longer 22.

414
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,130
我發誓  我向來支持你
I swear, I am on your side.

415
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,680
你總是口頭上說支持我
You keep saying you're on my side,

416
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,970
-而你的言行完全不一致  -他對我也是這樣
- but you don't act like it. - He does that to me, too.

417
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:46,560
我們為什么要容忍你這種行為
Why do we put up with it?

418
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,580
聽我說  我永遠做不到你現在做的事
Listen, I could never do what you're doing, okay?

419
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,270
我沒這么大膽
I would be terrified.

420
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,690
其實我心里也很害怕
Well, it's scary for me, too.

421
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,630
我還好啦
I'm fine with it.

422
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,780
我的意思是  不能因為我做不到
My point is, just because I couldn't do it

423
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,150
就代表你不應該去做
doesn't mean you shouldn't.

424
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:04,180
我為你驕傲
And I'm proud of you.

425
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:08,740
好的  謝謝
Okay. Thank you.

426
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,610
為了慶祝重歸于好
Well, to celebrate this reconciliation,

427
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:12,400
咱們分享一杯奶昔吧
let's all share a milk shake.

428
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,220
佩妮  你用吸管  我們"龍汲水"
Uh, Penny, you'll need a straw.

429
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,700
-你還是回來了  -是的
- You're back. - Yes, I am!

430
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,360
我還有一些話要對你說
There's a few more things I want to say to you.

431
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,040
斯圖爾特的店挺好的
Stuart's store is just fine,

432
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,670
而且他人也比你好多了
and he's a much nicer person than you are,

433
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,810
如果那本漫畫書還在
and if you still have that comic,

434
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:31,530
我現在就想買
I'd like to buy it right now!

435
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,450
沒問題
No problem.

436
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,660
等的時候要來杯拿鐵嗎
Oh, you want a latte while you wait?

437
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,640
不  我才不要拿鐵
No, I don't want a latte!

438
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,830
我要卡布奇諾和藍莓司康餅
I want a cappuccino and a blueberry scone!

439
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,680
我這里只有巧克力曲奇餅
I only have chocolate chip.

440
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,870
這更符合姐心意
Well, that sounds even better!

441
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,740
多謝你們陪我去看礦物巖石展
Thanks for coming to the mineral and rock show with me.

442
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:04,870
很抱歉艾米不想去
We're sorry Amy didn't want to go.

443
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:08,450
我們真的深感抱歉[后悔]
Really, really sorry.

444
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,800
有你們陪我  還要她干嘛
Who needs her when I have you guys?

445
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,700
巖石展覽
Rock show!

446
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,410
巖石展覽  巖石展覽
Rock show! Rock show!

447
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,470
巖石展覽  巖石展覽
Rock show! Rock show!

448

449
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,650
巖石展覽
Rock show...!
