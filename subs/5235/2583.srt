-Why?
-Payoff, I guess.

45
00:08:03,773 --> 00:08:05,832
什么?你猜?你不知道?
What, you guess? You don't know?

46
00:08:20,523 --> 00:08:24,015
靠!你他妈的有胆回来
Damn it! You've got a fucking lot
of nerve coming around here

47
00:08:24,126 --> 00:08:27,527
还趾高气扬的,怎么,你带了个婊子一块是吧?
all fucking high and mighty. What,
you bring your whore with you, did you?

48
00:08:37,907 --> 00:08:40,000
- 不.
- 看着!
-No, no, no.

Look, see. Look at that.
That's before we met, baby.

50
00:08:45,181 --> 00:08:46,443
给我想想.
Think about it.

51
00:09:00,429 --> 00:09:01,623
哦, 天啊.
Oh, God.

52
00:09:05,301 --> 00:09:06,529
哦, 天啊.
Oh, God.

53
00:09:13,643 --> 00:09:17,306
- 你想怎么样,波特?
- 我要把我的钱要回来.
-So, what are you gonna do, Porter?
-I'm gonna get my money back.

54
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,181
你看,我只好来找你了
You mean, what am I gonna do to you.

55
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,320
这由你决定
Well, that depends on you.

56
00:09:31,827 --> 00:09:32,953
瓦尔在哪?
Where's Val?

57
00:09:35,164 --> 00:09:36,859
我告诉过你,我不知道
I told you, I don't know.

58
00:09:40,703 --> 00:09:43,900
他不是老早就有财团了吗
Did he ever buy his way back
into the syndicate?

59
00:09:46,042 --> 00:09:47,134
嗯
Yeah.

60
00:09:49,345 --> 00:09:51,370
你是怎么从他那里拿钱的?
How do you get your payoffs?

61

送信的,一开始每月都投个带现金的信封

leaves an envelope with cash in it.

62
00:10:06,062 --> 00:10:10,294

So, who was she, anyway?
That girl in the picture.

63
00:10:12,034 --> 00:10:14,161
我出狱的时候遇见她
I met her when I got out of prison.

64
00:10:15,004 --> 00:10:18,440
我利用了她,本想在事做完之后确保她安全
I used to drive her,
keep her safe while she worked.

65
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,271
你算什么?拉皮条的?
What were you, her pimp?

66
00:10:24,146 --> 00:10:25,943
不.
No, no.

67
00:10:28,351 --> 00:10:30,342
我们一起为那个B工作过
We both worked for that asshole.

68
00:11:28,344 --> 00:11:29,572
现在不行
Not now.

69
00:11:31,414 --> 00:11:32,540
嗯
Yeah.

70

你没有毒瘾
You're cleaning up.

71
00:11:37,253 --> 00:11:38,220
是.
No.

72
00:14:01,997 --> 00:14:03,965
<i>瓦尔想和你通话.</i>
Val still wants to talk to you.

73
00:14:07,536 --> 00:14:08,662
<i>对不起,亲爱的.</i>
Sorry, babe.

74
00:14:10,706 --> 00:14:13,197
<i>我要让他再打给你吗?</i>
Shall I tell him to call back again?

75
00:14:13,976 --> 00:14:15,500
不,我来吧.
No, I'll talk to him.

76
00:14:15,978 --> 00:14:17,673
叫他别烦我
Shut him up, anyway.

77
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:21,874
瓦尔.
Val.

78
00:14:23,552 --> 00:14:26,020
啊,老样子,你呢?
Yeah, same as always. You?

79
00:14:26,455 --> 00:14:27,854
嗯,好,很好.
Yeah, good, good.

80
00:14:29,558 --> 00:14:31,150
什么?你现在在那?
Why? You there now?

81
00:14:34,964 --> 00:14:37,865
别怕，他们觉得白人都一个样
Well, don't sweat it, Val.
I mean, we all look alike to them.

82
00:14:40,302 --> 00:14:42,167
姓周的手下，同一批人
Same crew. The Chows.

83

- 三十五万到五十万.
-How much money in the case?

-And how much do you need, Val?
-We split it 50-50.

88
00:15:08,664 --> 00:15:12,259
我是指你需要多少才能回去
No, I mean, how much do you need to,
you know, buy your way back?

89
00:15:16,372 --> 00:15:19,637
重回组织.多少？
lnto the syndicate. How much?

90
00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:22,001
- 你是说黑道？
- 对啦
-You mean the outfit?
-Whatever.

91
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,170
天啊，你什么都知道
Jesus, you know everything.

92
00:15:25,681 --> 00:15:27,080
嗨，小妹妹
Hi, sweetie.

94
00:15:38,894 --> 00:15:41,158
漂亮的是...他们不会报警，
The beauty of the Chows
is they won't go to the cops.

95
00:15:41,263 --> 00:15:45,563
只能吃闷亏,他们也不会心痛
They keep everything in-house,
and they don't feel pain the way we do.

96
00:15:46,035 --> 00:15:48,003
这些人有什么不对劲？
You notice anything
about those guys, Val?

97
00:15:48,103 --> 00:15:49,468
都是狠角色
They look nasty.

98
00:15:49,571 --> 00:15:51,698
没准都是他妈的功夫高手
Probably all kung fu motherfuckers.

99

00:17:02,611 --> 00:17:04,010
你看他.
Looky here.

103
00:17:13,555 --> 00:17:15,455
被撞得很爽吧？
How's that vinyl taste?

104
00:17:29,838 --> 00:17:30,862
瓦尔!
Val!

105
00:17:31,607 --> 00:17:32,574
干嘛？
What?

106

那家伙怎么扁都扁不死

一小时后你还想再来一次
an hour later you wanna do it again.

108
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:55,387
Huh?

十四万
140 grand.

110
00:18:11,747 --> 00:18:13,078
各分十四万
140 apiece.

111
00:18:14,316 --> 00:18:15,442
总共
Total.

112
00:18:17,019 --> 00:18:18,247
总共？
Total?

113
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,222
这只有7万?
That's... That's what? That's 70 grand?

114
00:18:24,626 --> 00:18:26,389
-对我根本就不够
-我够了
-That's not enough.
-lt is for me.

115
00:18:26,495 --> 00:18:29,123
我要休息几个月
袋子交给你，亲爱的
I'm taking the next few months off.
Here's the bag, baby.

116
00:18:29,231 --> 00:18:30,823
我还缺...
Yeah, well, I'm up short.

117
00:18:30,933 --> 00:18:34,096
六万块钱. 那些臭家伙!
60 short. Fucking slants!

118
00:18:34,236 --> 00:18:37,034
早该礼拜二下手，可恶！
Should've hit them Tuesday. Fuck!

119
00:18:38,907 --> 00:18:42,900
这一笔干得干净俐落
还抢了一大笔钱
We got away clean
and got something to show for it.

120
00:18:43,979 --> 00:18:47,380
知足常乐，第一条规矩,瓦尔
Always be grateful for what you get.
Rule number one, Val.

121
00:18:48,884 --> 00:18:49,976

122
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:52,550
是啊...第一条规矩
Yeah. Rule number one.

123
00:19:03,332 --> 00:19:04,390
干嘛？
What?

124
00:19:11,306 --> 00:19:12,933
没事了
Everything's cool.

125
00:19:14,243 --> 00:19:16,541
只是钱不够
It's just not enough, all right?

126
00:19:16,912 --> 00:19:18,311
钱永远都不够，瓦尔
It never is, Val.

127
00:19:19,414 --> 00:19:22,247
亲爱的，把钱放车上
Hey, baby, just put the money
in the car, will you?

128
00:19:31,493 --> 00:19:32,960
难以想像...我们应该
I can't fucking believe it. We should...

129
00:19:33,061 --> 00:19:35,825
波特，你知道吗？
You know... You know what?
You know what, Porter?

130
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:40,359
很好笑. 你会笑死
This is funny. This'll kill you.

131
00:19:43,205 --> 00:19:44,900
我早就知道是十四万
It's always $140,000.

132
00:19:51,213 --> 00:19:53,374
应该有人颁我哲学博士头衔
Someone ought to give me a PhD.

133
00:19:54,183 --> 00:19:55,241
你...
You...

00:19:56,752 --> 00:19:57,980
妈的!
Shit!

135
00:19:58,854 --> 00:20:01,652
天, 林恩,
等我先躲开好吗？
Jesus, Lynn,
wait till I'm out of the fucking way!

136
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:14,965
没事了，宝贝
Okay, everything's cool, baby.

137
00:20:18,207 --> 00:20:20,937
Oh! Oh!

138
00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:26,470
你很棒，你很棒
You were great. You were great.

139
00:20:26,582 --> 00:20:28,709
没事了，枪给我
Everything's cool. Give me the... Okay.

140
00:20:28,817 --> 00:20:30,512
好吧，枪还是你拿着
Okay, okay, keep the gun.

141
00:20:30,619 --> 00:20:32,917
结束了，没事了
That's it. Everything's cool.

142
00:20:33,655 --> 00:20:36,419
都照计划进行
Just like we planned. Come on.

143
00:20:36,525 --> 00:20:38,425
振作点，可不要精神崩溃
Don't fall apart on me now.

144
00:20:39,628 --> 00:20:41,095
来吧
There we go.

145
00:20:52,307 --> 00:20:56,266
我打赌你的脑子里满是问题
Oh, I bet you got a lot of questions
rattling around in your head.

146
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,412
我也不晓得,宝贝
I don't know, pally.

147
00:21:03,518 --> 00:21:07,079
太太会对情人醋劲那么大
I guess wives get funny
when it comes to girlfriends, huh?

148
00:21:10,058 --> 00:21:11,116
什么？
What?

149
00:21:12,694 --> 00:21:14,059
我听不清楚
I didn't get that.

150
00:21:15,664 --> 00:21:16,995
是你要的哦
You got it.

151
00:21:52,701 --> 00:21:55,226
波特小姐，我没闲工夫等
Come on, Miss Porter,
I don't have all day!

152
00:22:15,157 --> 00:22:18,422
波特小姐在吗？
ls... Is Miss Porter here?

153
00:22:19,728 --> 00:22:20,956
是波特太太
Mrs. Porter.

154
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,095
随便啦
Yeah, whatever.

155
00:22:29,638 --> 00:22:31,572
王八蛋!
You motherfucker!

156
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,377
起来，转过去
Get up, turn around.

00:22:36,578 --> 00:22:38,409
起来
Come on. Get up. Come on.

158

-How much in here, huh?
-There's two grand.

160
00:22:51,126 --> 00:22:52,388
这是什么？
What's in here?

161
00:22:52,494 --> 00:22:55,019
氦? 你想会是什么？是海洛因!
Helium. What the fuck you think it is?
It's heroin.

162
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,290
Oh, fuck!

163
00:23:03,939 --> 00:23:05,998
惨了，惨了
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

他在哪？
Where is he?

167
00:23:13,648 --> 00:23:15,513
你想知道吗？
You wanna know where he is?

168
00:23:16,651 --> 00:23:20,178
他在这儿，你看.操你.
He's right here. Look. Look. Fuck you.

169
00:23:20,288 --> 00:23:21,778
答错了
Wrong answer.

170
00:23:23,358 --> 00:23:25,758
你这混蛋
Shit! You motherfucker!

171
00:23:26,294 --> 00:23:28,626
- 该死!
- 瓦尔雷斯尼克.

从来没听过,靠
I never heard of him, man. Fuck.

173
00:23:32,701 --> 00:23:35,135
钱和毒品哪儿来的？
Where'd you get the envelope
and the shit?

174
00:23:35,135 --> 00:23:37,435
拜托，他们会杀了我
Come on, man,
they're gonna fucking kill me.

175
00:23:37,506 --> 00:23:39,269
他们会把我杀了
They're gonna kill me, man.

176
00:23:43,245 --> 00:23:45,213
你以为我不敢？
What do you think I'm gonna do?

177
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,642
想活就快说
Worry about me.

178
00:23:47,349 --> 00:23:49,283
别这样，好啦...好啦...
Oh, come on. Okay.

179
00:23:49,384 --> 00:23:51,079
好, 好, 好.
Okay, okay, okay.

180
00:23:51,453 --> 00:23:54,684
史泰曼...亚瑟史泰曼那烂人
Stegman... Stegman, man.
Arthur fucking Stegman. Okay?

181
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,455

184
00:24:06,201 --> 00:24:07,361
谢了
Thanks.

00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,494
不客气

186
00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:35,897
我找亚瑟史泰曼
I'm looking for Arthur Stegman.

187
00:24:36,164 --> 00:24:38,689
他不在，我能效劳吗？
He ain't here.
Something I can help you with?

188
00:24:39,468 --> 00:24:41,800
不，你不能，他人呢？
No, you can't. Where is he?

189
00:24:42,771 --> 00:24:44,568
不晓得，他不在
I don't know. He ain't here.

190
00:24:46,842 --> 00:24:48,002
猜猜看
Take a guess.

191
00:24:49,044 --> 00:24:50,102
什么？
What?

192
00:24:52,514 --> 00:24:54,482
猜猜看他会在哪里
Take a guess about where he is.

193
00:25:04,659 --> 00:25:05,921
他在家吗？
Is he at home?

194
00:25:10,165 --> 00:25:12,133
你为啥不找个地方打手枪?
Why don't you go fuck yourself?

195
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,601
好,开始
All right, here we go.

196
00:25:16,705 --> 00:25:18,229
快点掷, 我赢了!
Hey, come on, roll it!

197
00:25:18,807 --> 00:25:21,640
- 等下,那是我的!
- 这不是你的,伙计.
-Wait a minute. That was mine!
-lt was not yours, man.

198
00:25:22,777 --> 00:25:24,108
我赢了
I get one more shot.

199
00:25:28,316 --> 00:25:30,375
有人要找你
There's somebody here to see you.

200
00:25:34,789 --> 00:25:36,450
我找史泰曼
I'm looking for Stegman.

201
00:25:41,429 --> 00:25:42,919
你是什么人？
Who the hell are you?

202
00:25:43,565 --> 00:25:44,623
我是波特
I'm Porter.

203
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,463
波特，看起来你...
犯了攻击罪
Well, Porter,
that looks like assault to me.

204
00:25:52,274 --> 00:25:55,573
看起来波特也会拒捕
Porter looks to me like the kind
that likes to resist arrest.

205
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,738
-Hey!
-Whoa!

206
00:25:59,848 --> 00:26:00,974
可恶，别在这里开枪
Fuck, no! Not in here.

207
00:26:01,082 --> 00:26:03,346
伙计们.他只是有话要说
Jesus, guys, he just... He wants to talk.

208
00:26:03,952 --> 00:26:06,079
对吧？ 对不对？
Am I right? Did I call it?

209
00:26:10,058 --> 00:26:11,616
你是史泰曼吗？
Are you Stegman?

210
00:26:13,228 --> 00:26:15,696
也许是. 你要什么？
Maybe. What do you want?

211
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:19,492
你手下的货没送成
Your boy didn't make his delivery.

212
00:26:20,835 --> 00:26:21,824
天啊
Jesus.

213
00:26:21,937 --> 00:26:23,837
哈,亚瑟.
Whoa, Artie.

214
00:26:23,939 --> 00:26:26,533
嘿,别担心这个
我们出去谈谈好吗
Hey, listen, don't worry about it.
Why don't we talk outside?

215
00:26:26,641 --> 00:26:28,233
亚瑟，你是毒贩？
Artie, you're a dealer?

216
00:26:28,877 --> 00:26:31,175
别多管闲事，好吗？
Just forget about it, all right?

217
00:26:31,646 --> 00:26:33,876
还有别碰我的钱
And don't touch my money, either.

218
00:26:34,049 --> 00:26:36,142
- 走吧
- 这是海洛因?
-Come on. Let's...
-This is heroin?

219
00:26:38,286 --> 00:26:40,914
- 这是海洛因
- 伙计们...
-This is heroin.
-Guys, just...

220
00:26:41,022 --> 00:26:44,924
别担心，轻松一点
咱们出去谈
Don't worry about it, all right?
Just take it easy. Let's talk. Come on.

221
00:26:46,294 --> 00:26:48,819
看什么看？玩你的牌
What are you guys looking at?
Play your game.

222
00:26:49,497 --> 00:26:52,830
你想把血都滴到我的睡椅上吗?
走吧. 走吧.
And you're bleeding all over my couch.
Come on, you. Come on.

223
00:26:58,907 --> 00:27:00,966
史泰曼在瞒着我们
Steggie's been holding out on us.

224
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:03,843
我去查一查
I'll check it out.

225
00:27:05,146 --> 00:27:06,272
瓦尔雷斯尼克
Val Resnick.

226
00:27:09,017 --> 00:27:11,178
- 他怎样？
- 他在哪？
-What about him?
-You're gonna tell me where he is.

227
00:27:11,286 --> 00:27:14,278
不行，就算我知道也不会说
No. No. Even if I knew,
the answer would still be no.

228
00:27:14,389 --> 00:27:16,619
你在哪里碰到送货小弟？
Now, where'd you meet up
with my delivery boy?

229
00:27:16,725 --> 00:27:17,749
送货的地方
At his drop.

230
00:27:17,859 --> 00:27:18,951
他死了？
Is he dead?

231
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:22,257
没有，不过女的死了，吸毒过量
No, but she is. OD'd on that crap
you've been sending her.

232
00:27:23,064 --> 00:27:24,053
又怎样？
So?

233
00:27:24,499 --> 00:27:26,990
- 关你什么事？
- 我是她先生
-What do you care?
-I'm her husband.

234
00:27:29,004 --> 00:27:31,438
你不会杀我吧？
You're not gonna fucking kill me,
are you?

235
00:27:34,376 --> 00:27:36,105
在孩子面前不会
Not in front of these kids.

236
00:27:38,113 --> 00:27:39,478
他人呢？
Where is he?

237
00:27:43,985 --> 00:27:45,384
不知道
I don't know.

238
00:27:45,687 --> 00:27:46,711
是真的
That's the truth.

239
00:27:46,821 --> 00:27:49,483
货是昨晚才送给我的
You see, this stuff gets delivered to me,
too, you know. Last night.

240
00:27:49,591 --> 00:27:52,116
下个月才会再联络
And I won't see anyone again
till next month.

241
00:27:53,995 --> 00:27:55,462
干嘛这么麻烦？
Why all the trouble?

242
00:27:55,664 --> 00:27:57,859
他怕那女的
Well, he's afraid of the girl.

243
00:27:57,966 --> 00:28:01,732
我是说... 波特太太
You know, I mean, of... Of Mrs. Porter.

244
00:28:05,306 --> 00:28:07,797
我知道的就这么多
Look, I don't know nothing
about this, okay?

245
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:09,706
其他我都不知道
I know Val from the old days.

246
00:28:09,811 --> 00:28:12,746
三个月前他找到我,要我帮忙
Three months ago he shows up,
asks me to do him a favor.

247
00:28:12,847 --> 00:28:16,180
我每月多赚一千，何乐不为？
I make an extra grand a month,
so I figure, what the hell, right?

248
00:28:16,284 --> 00:28:18,218
你干嘛要威胁要杀我？
Now you come around
threatening to kill me?

249
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:21,049
相信我,
我又不是瓦尔的死党
Believe me,
that much a buddy of Val's, I am not.

250
00:28:21,456 --> 00:28:23,481
我只知道他还在城里
He's in the city. That's it.
That's all I know.

251
00:28:23,591 --> 00:28:26,560
- 我得进去了
- 你怎么知道他在？
-I got a game going on in here.
-How do you know that?

252
00:28:26,861 --> 00:28:27,885
他说的.
He said so.

253
00:28:27,996 --> 00:28:30,055
- 几时？
- 哦
-When?
-When he... Then.

254
00:28:30,165 --> 00:28:31,154
他来我这里时
When he came around.

255
00:28:31,266 --> 00:28:33,359
跟我说他又回到黑帮
Said that he squared himself
with the syndicate.

256
00:28:33,468 --> 00:28:35,231
这次肯定能吃香喝辣
Said he was back in the big time.

257
00:28:35,336 --> 00:28:37,736
他很兴奋
Back for good. He was very excited.

258
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:40,637
你跟他说波特也回来了
Well, you tell him
that Porter is back, too,

259
00:28:41,476 --> 00:28:43,706
来跟他要钱
波特要讨回他的钱
and he wants his money,
Porter wants his money.

260
00:28:43,812 --> 00:28:45,279
否则我会来找你
Or I'll come back here
and pay you a visit

261
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,746
- 等孩子不在的时候
- 啊...
-when these kids are not around.
-Well...

262
00:28:50,552 --> 00:28:52,042
我该几时跟他说？
When would I tell him this?

263
00:29:13,975 --> 00:29:15,306
请讲.
Talk to me.

264
00:29:15,543 --> 00:29:19,035
<i>有位小姐找你，她叫珀尔.</i>
There's a young lady to see you, sir.
Her name is Pearl.

265
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,441
她有两种不良嗜好
She's got two very bad habits.

266
00:29:21,549 --> 00:29:24,518
现在,
我只对其中一种有兴趣
Right now,
I'm only interested in one of them.

267
00:29:25,286 --> 00:29:26,651
让她上来.
Send her up.

268
00:29:29,891 --> 00:29:32,917
718室, 小姐. 请上去.
Apartment 71 8, ma'am. Go right on up.

269
00:29:52,814 --> 00:29:55,544
<i>- 叫她上来，搞什么？
- 瓦尔,我是哈斯卡.</i>
-Send her up. What's the problem?
-Hey, Val, it's Haskell.

270
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:57,413
<i>抱歉打扰你,不过我想..</i>
Sorry to be calling you at home,
but I thought...

271
00:29:57,519 --> 00:29:59,783
别道歉，不要烦我
Don't be sorry, sweetie. Just don't call.

272
00:29:59,888 --> 00:30:01,617
<i>我想,这应该是大事.</i>
Well, I thought it might be important.

273
00:30:01,723 --> 00:30:04,157
<i>南区计程车行的小子来电.</i>
I got a call from a cab guy
out in the south end.

274
00:30:04,259 --> 00:30:06,386
<i>- 什么事？
- 史泰曼那小子.</i>
-What is it?
-Well, it's this guy, Stegman.

275
00:30:06,494 --> 00:30:08,359
可恶，等一下
Shit. Hold on a second.

276
00:30:17,005 --> 00:30:20,236
跪下来，婊子
我要好好教训你
On your knees, bitch.
I want satisfaction.

277
00:30:21,476 --> 00:30:23,171
我在讲电话，珀尔
I'm on the phone, Pearl.

278
00:30:27,081 --> 00:30:29,709
叫我珀尔夫人，臭狗屎
That's Mistress Pearl,
you piece of dog shit.

279
00:30:29,818 --> 00:30:31,979
我正在讲电话
I'm on the fucking phone!

280
00:30:36,524 --> 00:30:38,219
有屁快放
Make it quick, huh?

281
00:30:38,326 --> 00:30:41,659
<i>史泰曼打电话来
他很紧张</i>
So, anyhow, this guy Stegman called.
He sounded all nervous.

282
00:30:41,963 --> 00:30:45,057
<i>听上去吓得屁滚尿流.</i>
Sounded like something
scared the shit out of him.

283
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:48,693
<i>他想找你，我说我会安排</i>
He said he had to talk to you.
I said I'd see what I could do, Val.

284
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,438
他没说是什么事？
Y eah? Did he tell you
what it was about?

285
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:53,700
<i>他说林恩死了.</i>
He said to tell you Lynn was dead.

286
00:30:53,808 --> 00:30:56,868
<i>他说有个家伙放话要找你</i>
He said some guy came around
talking mean and wanted you.

287
00:30:56,978 --> 00:31:00,209
<i>他没说别的.我只想让你知道</i>
And that's all he said.
I thought you ought to know.

288
00:31:00,315 --> 00:31:03,716
做得好，我会去找那个婊子养的
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you did right.
I wanna talk to that son of a bitch.

289
00:31:03,818 --> 00:31:05,251
<i>谁？史泰曼吗？</i>
Who, Stegman?

290
00:31:06,354 --> 00:31:09,187
还尼克森总统吗?
当然是史泰曼
No, President Nixon.
Of course Stegman.

291
00:31:09,691 --> 00:31:12,057
叫他到桥下的瓦里克酒吧等我
T ell him Varrick's by the bridge.

292
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,557
这样吧...
Make it...

293
00:31:15,563 --> 00:31:17,497
二十分钟后, 知道吗?
Make it 20 minutes, huh?

294
00:31:31,212 --> 00:31:32,338
- 史泰曼.
- 瓦尔.
-Steggie.
-Hey, Val.

295
00:31:32,447 --> 00:31:33,607
你知道,我一直想和你联系
You know, I tried to call you,

296
00:31:33,715 --> 00:31:36,115
不过你好像换了号码了,我找不到你
but you must have changed your
number again. 'Cause I got nothing.

297
00:31:36,217 --> 00:31:39,812
我从来没有给你过我的固定电话,史泰曼
I never gave you
my original number, Steg.

298
00:31:40,889 --> 00:31:42,447
那个家伙长什么样
What did this guy look like?

299
00:31:42,557 --> 00:31:45,788
嗯,他有黑头发,蓝眼睛
Well, he had, like, dark hair, blue eyes.

300
00:31:45,894 --> 00:31:48,590
长的象克鲁马努人一样发育不全.
He was like
a real Cro-Magnon-looking bastard.

301
00:31:48,696 --> 00:31:51,256
那么,林恩死了 就有人来找事,是吧?
Well, if Lynn's dead,
maybe he did us a favor, huh?

302
00:31:51,366 --> 00:31:54,301
我知道你什么意思
我不是希罕这一千块钱
I know what you mean, except
I'm out like a grand a month, you know?

303
00:31:54,402 --> 00:31:56,700
是啊我们可以协商解决
Well, maybe we can
work something out.

304
00:31:57,338 --> 00:31:59,033
你有那人的名字吗?
Did you get a name?

305
00:31:59,707 --> 00:32:01,800
他说他叫波特
He said his name was Porter.

306
00:32:02,877 --> 00:32:04,504
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

307
00:32:05,313 --> 00:32:09,409
- 他说他为了波特而来
- 不,不是,他说他叫波特
-He said he was there for Porter?
-No. No, he said he was Porter.

308
00:32:15,123 --> 00:32:17,057
我要跟你老实说
Yeah. I'll tell you something.

309
00:32:17,292 --> 00:32:20,284
我不想让那家伙盯着我,你要理解我
I wouldn't want that guy after me, either.
I know how you must feel.

310
00:32:20,395 --> 00:32:22,693
我是谁?无名氏吗?
What am l, a nobody?

311
00:32:22,897 --> 00:32:24,990
- 不是.
- 我有手下.
-No.
-I've got friends.

312
00:32:25,466 --> 00:32:27,093
只要我吩咐一声
All I have to do is point.

313
00:32:27,201 --> 00:32:29,965
拿起电话，说出他的名字，他就死定了
I pick up a phone, say his name,
and he's a dead man.

314
00:32:30,071 --> 00:32:31,902
这次他活不了！
And this time he stays dead!

315
00:32:32,006 --> 00:32:34,839
好好，瓦尔，冷静
好吗?
All right, Val, try to keep it down.
All right?

316
00:32:34,943 --> 00:32:36,240
别激动.
It's okay.

317
00:32:37,245 --> 00:32:39,713
- 他提到我什么？
- 没什么
-What did he say about me?
-He just... Nothing.

318
00:32:39,814 --> 00:32:43,341
- 他说你欠他钱.
- 没说别的吗？
-He just said you owed him money.
-Not why? Nothing else?

319
00:32:43,484 --> 00:32:44,678
没有.
Nothing.

320
00:32:45,053 --> 00:32:48,318
- 怎么?你欠他多少？
- 不关你的屁事
-Why? How much you owe him?
-None of your goddamn business.

321
00:32:49,123 --> 00:32:50,215
呃，我想...
Well, I just, you know...

322
00:32:50,325 --> 00:32:52,987
我只是觉得他想杀你
I got the feeling
he'd like to kill you, that's all.

323
00:32:53,094 --> 00:32:54,425
天啊
Oh, Christ.

324
00:32:55,596 --> 00:32:56,756
波特
Porter.

325
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,328
什么?
What?

326
00:33:03,972 --> 00:33:05,769
你跟他都说了什么？
What did you tell him?

327
00:33:05,873 --> 00:33:08,137
没有. 我能说什么？
Nothing. What could I tell him?

328
00:33:08,309 --> 00:33:10,800
你告诉他，那笔钱，海洛因
You tell him about the money?
The heroin?

329
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,607
都在他手上
He had it with him.

330
00:33:12,714 --> 00:33:14,113
我只说货是我送的.
I just... I told him I delivered it.

331
00:33:14,215 --> 00:33:17,548
- 没说别的吗？
- 我什么也不知道
-You didn't tell him nothing else?
-I don't know nothing else.

332
00:33:18,086 --> 00:33:20,213
不，你跟他说什么了
Nah. You gave him something.

333
00:33:20,722 --> 00:33:22,917
你一定招出名字让他来找我
A name, maybe.
Someone who knows where to find me.

334
00:33:23,024 --> 00:33:26,460
- 我向我老母发誓...
- 去你老母!
-I swear, Val, on my mother...
-Hey, fuck your mother!

335
00:33:27,161 --> 00:33:30,426
骂人就不好了，冷静点
Hey, that's not nice.
Now, why don't you try to take it easy?

336
00:33:30,531 --> 00:33:32,158
- 看什么看？
- 冷静
-What the fuck you looking at?
-Take it easy.

337
00:33:32,266 --> 00:33:34,291
瓦尔别这样
不要闹事了
Val, don't. Come on. Not again.
Don't do that.

338
00:33:34,402 --> 00:33:37,394
- 你他妈看什么看？
- 瓦尔，拜托你，别闹事
-What the fuck you looking at?
-No, Val, no. Come on. Not again.

339
00:33:37,505 --> 00:33:40,133
- 你他妈看什么看？
- 瓦尔，拜托你，别闹事
-What the fuck are you looking at?
-Val, come on, don't. Not again.

340
00:33:40,241 --> 00:33:42,334
- 快点住手
- 有问题吗？
-Come on, just forget it.
-ls there some trouble here?

341
00:33:42,443 --> 00:33:44,911
没有，你知道，呃...
我们正要走
No, you know what? We're...
We're just... We're leaving.

342
00:33:45,013 --> 00:33:46,241
马上走
We're leaving.

343
00:33:46,848 --> 00:33:49,282
这样吧，瓦尔，我请客
You know what, Val?
This one's on me, okay?

344
00:33:49,384 --> 00:33:51,045
难道要我掏钱请客吗？
You see me reaching
for my fucking wallet?

345
00:33:51,152 --> 00:33:52,141
不.
No.

346
00:33:56,357 --> 00:34:00,054
- 老兄，迈克尔在吗？
- 他在那里
-Hey, pal, is there a Michael here?
-That's him over yonder.

347
00:34:02,697 --> 00:34:03,891
迈克尔
Michael.

348
00:34:04,298 --> 00:34:07,859
听说你认识高级应召女郎
I'm told you're the man to see
about expensive horizontal refreshment.

349
00:34:07,969 --> 00:34:10,096
我在找一位叫萝丝的女孩
I'm looking for a girl named Rosie.

350
00:34:10,805 --> 00:34:14,673
召妓是违法的,
你说什么我不懂
Prostitution is illegal,
and you're speaking Greek.

351
00:34:18,312 --> 00:34:21,873
这种事通常要低调一点
Usually these matters are conducted
with more discretion.

352
00:34:26,587 --> 00:34:28,145
这样够低调吗？
Be discreet now.

353
00:34:33,661 --> 00:34:35,561
- 她叫什么？
- 萝丝
-What was her name again?
-Rosie.

354
00:34:35,663 --> 00:34:37,187
谁要找她？
And who should I say is looking for her?

355
00:34:37,298 --> 00:34:38,765
打给她就是了
Just call her.

356
00:34:48,543 --> 00:34:49,601
<i>- 萝丝？
- 是我</i>
-Rosie?
-Yeah.

357
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,337
电话给我
Give me the phone.

358
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,238
拿着
Here.

359
00:34:53,781 --> 00:34:55,646
拿好你的钱.
Take care of that.

360
00:34:56,884 --> 00:34:59,045
<i>- 萝丝？.
- 你是什么人？</i>
-Rosie.
-Who the hell is this?

361
00:34:59,554 --> 00:35:02,682
<i>- 波特
- 少来，波特死了</i>
-Porter.
-Try again, honey. Porter's dead.

362
00:35:03,858 --> 00:35:07,692
我以前是你的司机兼保镖
I used to drive for you,
provide a safe work environment.

363
00:35:08,663 --> 00:35:09,823
<i>波特？</i>
Porter?

364
00:35:10,932 --> 00:35:11,921
嗯.
Yeah.

365
00:35:51,672 --> 00:35:52,696
嗨.
Hi.

366
00:35:57,278 --> 00:35:58,905
快进来
Come on. Come in.

367
00:36:00,414 --> 00:36:02,905
你这死人气色挺好的
You look pretty good for a dead guy.

368
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:12,687
- 你怎么听说的？
- 有人在放话.
-How'd you hear about it?
-People who know were talking.

369
00:36:13,227 --> 00:36:16,253
我也听说你老婆也自己回来了
Plus, I heard
your wife was back in town alone.

370
00:36:17,832 --> 00:36:19,163
她死了
She's dead.

371
00:36:20,601 --> 00:36:22,228
很遗憾，波特
I'm sorry, Porter.

372
00:36:23,704 --> 00:36:24,728
为什么？
Why?

373
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:29,667
天啊，你还是没变
你还是一样冷酷无情
Jesus. Surly Porter.
You're the same as ever, aren't you?

374
00:36:34,215 --> 00:36:36,274
这不像你的作风
This doesn't look like you.

375
00:36:37,652 --> 00:36:39,643
人都会改变
Yeah, well, people change.

376
00:36:40,621 --> 00:36:43,021
不要动，没关系
Stay. It's okay, baby. It's okay.

377
00:36:43,691 --> 00:36:45,625
没关系，宝贝，好的
Come on, sweetheart. It's okay.

378
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:48,824
这是世上最悍的狗
Meet the nastiest damn dog
who ever lived.

379
00:36:51,499 --> 00:36:53,467
- 叫什么？
- 波特
-What's his name?
-Porter.

380
00:36:55,336 --> 00:36:57,429
你走后，它负责保护我
He took your job after you left.

381
00:36:57,538 --> 00:37:00,701
跟你一样狠，只是不会离开我
He's just as tough,
but he won't leave me, will you, baby?

382
00:37:09,684 --> 00:37:11,174
我要你帮忙
I need a favor.

383
00:37:12,153 --> 00:37:13,347
帮忙？
A favor?

384
00:37:14,155 --> 00:37:16,555
也许你真的变了
Maybe you're not the same as ever.

385
00:37:19,727 --> 00:37:22,025
我找地下组织的人
I'm looking for a syndicate boy.

386
00:37:23,631 --> 00:37:25,792
那是黑道，已没人说地下组织
It's the outfit, baby.
We don't say syndicate anymore.

387
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,334
你知道我什么意思。随你怎么说
Well, you know what I mean.
Whatever the hell you call it.

388
00:37:28,436 --> 00:37:30,927
别生气，波特
他叫什么？
Don't get touchy, Porter.
What's his name?

389
00:37:31,906 --> 00:37:33,271
瓦尔雷斯尼克
Val Resnick.

390
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,644
那狗娘养的
Oh, that son of a bitch.

391
00:37:38,946 --> 00:37:40,937
- 你认识他？
- 没错
-You know him?
-Yeah.

392
00:37:42,116 --> 00:37:44,778
几年前见过面
I met up with him once a few years ago.

393
00:37:44,986 --> 00:37:48,251
他喜欢毒打应召女郎
He can't use Star Service anymore
because he beats up all the girls.

394
00:37:48,356 --> 00:37:50,153
差点打死一个
He almost killed one.

395
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,383
就是你？
You?

396
00:37:56,664 --> 00:37:59,929
重要吗？你丢下我不管
Does it matter?
You quit looking after me, remember?

397
00:38:03,537 --> 00:38:06,170
你知道他在哪儿吗？
Would you happen to have a line
on where he might be?

398
00:38:08,342 --> 00:38:11,743
- 我想他住在旅馆吧？
- 哪一家？
-I suppose he's at the hotel.
-Which one?

399
00:38:11,846 --> 00:38:14,007
黑道住的旅馆，他们都住那.
The outfit hotel. They're all there.

400
00:38:15,316 --> 00:38:17,011
你有地址吗？
You got an address?

401
00:38:18,886 --> 00:38:20,649
我们是朋友，对吧？
We're friends, right?

402
00:38:21,555 --> 00:38:23,386
至少以前是
I mean, we used to be.

403
00:38:24,325 --> 00:38:25,383
我现在也是黑道手下
But I'm an employee, too,

404
00:38:25,493 --> 00:38:27,393
我想他们不喜欢我告诉你
and I don't think
the outfit would like me telling you

405
00:38:27,495 --> 00:38:28,826
旅馆在哪里
where the hotel was, would they?

406
00:38:28,929 --> 00:38:31,591
- 肯定，你认为我会干嘛
- 你有多强悍，波特？
-No. What do you think I'm gonna do?
-How strong are you, Porter?

407
00:38:31,699 --> 00:38:35,499
我认为你是世上最强悍的人
Personally, I think you are
the strongest man I have ever met.

408
00:38:35,903 --> 00:38:37,996
不过这还不够
But I wonder if it's enough.

409
00:38:38,472 --> 00:38:39,700
为什么？
For what?

410
00:38:40,675 --> 00:38:44,338
你一定是想找他麻烦
If I know you, you want this Resnick guy
for something he won't like.

411
00:38:44,445 --> 00:38:46,208
对，我要杀他
Yeah, I'm gonna kill him.

412
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:51,314
他不会喜欢的
That's something he won't like.

413
00:38:53,587 --> 00:38:55,452
要是你没干好被抓到
What if something goes wrong,
and they grab you

414
00:38:55,556 --> 00:38:57,717
他们问你消息是谁说的
and they ask you
where you found out about the hotel?

415
00:38:57,825 --> 00:39:00,453
这个你不用担心
我不会把你招出来
Why are we even talking about this?
You know I wouldn't turn you in.

416
00:39:00,561 --> 00:39:02,358
我不会招出来是谁说的
I wouldn't talk about who told me what.

417
00:39:02,463 --> 00:39:04,658
如果他们会对你严刑拷打呢
But what if they ask you hard?

418
00:39:05,633 --> 00:39:08,966
我就说是计程车行的史泰曼
I'll tell them it was a cab dispatcher
named Stegman.

419
00:39:13,407 --> 00:39:15,773
橡木旅馆，联合街和十七街路口
The Oakwood Arms, Union and 1 7th.

420
00:39:24,752 --> 00:39:27,721
直到现在，你都故意没问我的情况
All this time, you don't even pretend
to ask how I've been.

421
00:39:31,192 --> 00:39:33,183
现金还是其他的？
You need any cash or anything?

422
00:39:37,865 --> 00:39:41,198
你去死吧，混蛋
我会跟他说你来的
Get yourself killed, prick.
I ought to tell him you're coming.

423
00:40:18,439 --> 00:40:19,633
你好，瓦尔
Hi, Val.

424
00:40:22,109 --> 00:40:23,701
钱呢？
Where's my money?

425
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:32,915
不在那儿，你的枪在这儿
No, it's not there. I took your gun.
It's back here.

426
00:40:33,487 --> 00:40:34,454
你看起来像个男妓
You look like a pro.

427
00:40:34,555 --> 00:40:37,524
你乖乖闭嘴，就能活着走出去
You keep your mouth shut,
and you'll walk out of here.

428
00:40:41,128 --> 00:40:42,993
我的七万，我要讨回
My 70 grand, I want it.

429
00:40:44,999 --> 00:40:47,024
已经不在我这里
I don't have it right now.

430
00:40:47,802 --> 00:40:48,860
在哪里？
Where is it?

431
00:40:48,969 --> 00:40:53,633
我把十三万都给了黑道
I gave all $130,000 to the outfit.
I gave it all to them.

432
00:40:54,909 --> 00:40:58,709
跟他们说那不是你的钱
Well, tell them you gave them
money that doesn't belong to you,

433
00:40:59,914 --> 00:41:01,472
去要回来
and get it back.

434
00:41:01,649 --> 00:41:05,016
办不到，波特，你不知道这些人...
Now, Porter, I can't do that.
I mean, you don't know these...

435
00:41:06,454 --> 00:41:09,719
不管怎样你都会杀我
You're gonna kill me
whether I get the money or not.

436
00:41:09,924 --> 00:41:12,688
好吧，我去拿钱
All right, I'll get it. I'll get it.
I'll get the money.

437
00:41:12,793 --> 00:41:14,283
给我几天的时间，好不好？
Just give me a few days, all right?

438
00:41:14,395 --> 00:41:16,488
你在干嘛？
What the fuck are you doing?

439
00:41:17,364 --> 00:41:20,299
明天中午，快答应
Noon. Tomorrow. Say it.

440
00:41:20,868 --> 00:41:21,994
好吧
All right.

441
00:41:22,102 --> 00:41:26,129
拜托你，波特原谅我吧
我是不得已的，你应该了解
You know, this may sound crazy, Porter,
but no hard feelings, huh?

442
00:41:26,707 --> 00:41:29,870
你会感激我所做的
I did what I had to do.
You could appreciate that.

443
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,873
我能够了解
你个婊子养的
Yeah, I appreciate that,
you son of a bitch.

444
00:41:31,979 --> 00:41:33,606
不，不，别
No, no, no. Don't.

445
00:41:35,049 --> 00:41:37,279
请，让我来
Please. Allow me.

446
00:41:45,693 --> 00:41:47,752
天啊，上帝
Jesus. God.

447
00:41:53,868 --> 00:41:54,892
上帝
God.

448
00:41:56,103 --> 00:41:57,502
臭婊子！
You bitch!

449
00:42:00,174 --> 00:42:01,607
让她干活
Let her work.

450
00:42:15,222 --> 00:42:16,883
我爱你，宝贝
Me love you, baby.

451
00:42:18,859 --> 00:42:20,986
我要好好地玩你
Me love you long time.

452
00:42:27,601 --> 00:42:29,296
不，等一下
Wait up, hon. Wait.

453
00:42:35,576 --> 00:42:37,567
明天. 中午
Tomorrow. Noon.

454
00:42:38,178 --> 00:42:42,581
你把钱带到第七街和富兰克林街口
You and the money, be at the corner
of 7th and Franklin at the pay phone.

455
00:42:44,018 --> 00:42:46,179
好，好
Okay. Okay.

456
00:42:48,322 --> 00:42:50,085
这是哪儿来的？
Where'd you get this?

457
00:42:52,026 --> 00:42:54,324
一个妓女的架子上
Some hooker had it on her shelf.

458
00:42:54,662 --> 00:42:57,426
我认出你，所以偷偷拿走
I recognized you.
I swiped it in case I could use it.

459
00:42:57,531 --> 00:42:59,123
你有打她吗？
Did you hurt her?

460
00:43:00,134 --> 00:43:02,295
你有打那妓女吗？
The hooker, did you hurt her?

461
00:43:02,403 --> 00:43:05,065
什么跟什么吗？
What does that have to do
with anything?

462
00:43:13,347 --> 00:43:15,247
我有几分钟空档
I've got a few minutes.

463
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:18,077
去煮蛋吧
So go boil an egg.

464
00:43:31,265 --> 00:43:32,755
需要效劳吗？
Can I help you?

465
00:43:35,769 --> 00:43:38,966
瓦尔雷斯尼克.
我和卡特先生约好了
Val Resnick.
I got an appointment with Mr. Carter.

466
00:43:40,407 --> 00:43:41,465
好的
Yes.

467
00:43:43,611 --> 00:43:44,669
转过身去
Turn around, please.

468
00:43:44,778 --> 00:43:46,268
听着，伙计，你没必要这么干
Listen, sweetie,
you don't have to do that.

469
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,779
转身
Turn around.

470
00:43:50,618 --> 00:43:51,949
谢谢
Thank you.

471
00:44:02,162 --> 00:44:04,187
- 很好
- 你喜欢吗?
-Very nice.
-You like that?

472
00:44:08,369 --> 00:44:11,099
- 下面.
- 是的.
-It's down there.
-Yes.

473
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,365
这么说你来者不善啊
This isn't how
Mr. Carter likes his visitors.

474
00:44:15,476 --> 00:44:16,670
我知道.
I know.

475
00:44:17,044 --> 00:44:19,774
我是惹上麻烦了才这样.
It's just I'm in a little bit of trouble
right now.

476
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,178
是的，卡特先生也这么认为
Yes, Mr. Carter thinks so, too.

477
00:44:23,584 --> 00:44:25,211
这边请.
This way, please.

478
00:44:25,886 --> 00:44:29,549
菲利浦说你惹上麻烦需要帮忙
Philip tells me you have a problem
you need help with.

479
00:44:30,124 --> 00:44:31,352
是的，老大
Yes, sir.

480
00:44:32,326 --> 00:44:36,126
就是昨晚闯进旅馆的家伙？
Is it your problem who breached
our security last night at the Oakwood?

481
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:37,458
是的，老大
Yes, sir.

482
00:44:37,765 --> 00:44:39,494
他闯进我房间...
Then he breaks into my apartment...

483
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,125
我们有3个方法可以搞定这事
There's three ways
that we can handle this.

484
00:44:42,236 --> 00:44:44,397
一，我们可以帮你
One, we can help you.

485
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:47,707
二，我们让你自生自灭
Two, we can allow you to help yourself.

486
00:44:47,808 --> 00:44:50,333
三呢，我们把你做掉
And three, we can have you replaced.

487
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,875
我们在你身上做了投资，雷斯尼克
We have an investment in you, Resnick.

488
00:44:54,982 --> 00:44:59,351
所以帮你可以说是保护投资
So assisting you would be,
in a way, protecting our investment.

489
00:45:00,721 --> 00:45:03,383
这一向是我们最好的政策
And that is always
good business policy.

490
00:45:04,058 --> 00:45:08,188
是的，老大，卡特先生
谢谢你，你不会后悔的
Yes, sir. Yes, sir, Mr. Carter.
Thank you, sir. You won't regret it.

491
00:45:08,862 --> 00:45:09,886
现在,
Now,

492
00:45:12,232 --> 00:45:15,759
菲利浦说有人想杀你？
according to Philip,
a man has come to town to kill you?

493
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,927
是的，老大
Yes, sir.

494
00:45:17,037 --> 00:45:19,972
据你说他是个职业抢匪，只有一个人
And you say that he's alone
and that he's a professional robber.

495
00:45:20,074 --> 00:45:21,098
是不是?
Is that correct?

496
00:45:21,208 --> 00:45:25,167
是的. 他抢薪水和银行，天生坏胚子
Yes, sir. He does payroll jobs, banks,
you know, stuff like that.

497
00:45:25,446 --> 00:45:27,437
- 他叫什么？
- 波特
-What's his name?
-Porter.

498
00:45:28,849 --> 00:45:30,942
呃，名字是什么？
Well, what's his first name?

499
00:45:34,855 --> 00:45:35,947
这个我不知道
You know, I don't know it.

500
00:45:36,056 --> 00:45:38,183
他自称波特外没别的名字了
He never called himself
anything but Porter.

501
00:45:50,037 --> 00:45:53,336
那十三万是哪儿来的？
Where did you get the $130,000?

502
00:45:56,877 --> 00:45:59,641
他为这笔钱来城里找你？
That's why
this man has come to town, huh?

503
00:46:00,114 --> 00:46:02,605
为了你还我们的十三万？
The $130,000 that you paid us back?

504
00:46:03,117 --> 00:46:05,677
是的，老大，只有七万是他的
Yes, sir, but only $70,000 of it was his.

505
00:46:05,786 --> 00:46:08,277
又没问你钱的来路
Well, we never asked you
where you got the money.

506
00:46:08,388 --> 00:46:10,049
这与我们无关
It was none of our business.

507
00:46:10,157 --> 00:46:13,217
不过现在似乎与我们有关了
But now it appears
it has become our business.

508
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:19,123
他的档案，卡特老大
Here's his file, Mr. Carter.

509
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,669
你知道你对组织的用处吗？雷斯尼克？
Do you understand your value
to the organization, Resnick?

510
00:46:32,713 --> 00:46:36,410
你丧尽天良，这迟早有用
You're a sadist. You lack compunction.
That comes in handy.

511
00:46:37,017 --> 00:46:39,986
不过现在你却让个人的私事
But now you've allowed an area
of your personal life

512
00:46:40,087 --> 00:46:42,055
危害到组织
to become a danger to us.

513
00:46:44,324 --> 00:46:48,090
我们要的是坚强独立的手下
A man in our organization
needs to be tough and self-reliant.

514
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:52,597
如果你能自己解决问题
Were you to handle this problem
on your own,

515
00:46:54,735 --> 00:46:56,635
毫无疑问地
there would be no doubt

516
00:46:58,472 --> 00:47:00,497
你就符合我们的要求
that you're the kind of man we want.

517
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,904
我想解决问题
I want to.

518
00:47:02,176 --> 00:47:05,270
- 我要自己处理，卡特老大
- 太好了
-I want to handle it myself, Mr. Carter.
-Great.

519
00:47:06,513 --> 00:47:07,673
在事情没结束之前
Until the matter is handled,

520
00:47:07,781 --> 00:47:10,579
我要你先搬出橡木旅馆
I want you to move out
of the Oakwood Arms.

521
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,151
可是我没地方...
But I don't have a place...

522
00:47:15,255 --> 00:47:18,383
我不能再让旅馆出事
I don't want any more unpleasantness
at the hotel.

523
00:47:20,694 --> 00:47:21,922
是的，老大
Yes, sir.

524
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:25,060
瓦尔丢尽了颜面，斯派德
That's it. Val's in the doghouse, Spider.

525
00:47:25,165 --> 00:47:26,962
我建议我们另谋他路
I'll fill you in on the way.

526
00:47:29,269 --> 00:47:31,134
他喜欢我，我们走吧
He loves me. Let's go.

527
00:47:32,139 --> 00:47:33,834
他不顶你，瓦尔
He doesn't love you, Val.

528
00:47:34,174 --> 00:47:36,665
对不起，我们另有任务
Sorry. We've been reassigned.

529
00:47:39,379 --> 00:47:40,641
无所谓
Go ahead.

530
00:47:40,981 --> 00:47:44,781
昨晚到现在，没有你们我一样很安全
看着我，看看
After last night, I'm safer without you.
Look at me. Look at this.

531
00:47:44,885 --> 00:47:46,819
好的不得了
What the fuck good are you, huh?

532
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,512
滚
Get out of here.

533
00:47:48,856 --> 00:47:51,518
我不会忘了你们的逼脸的
Never forget a pussy's face,
you remember that.

534
00:47:53,861 --> 00:47:55,522
我自己解决
I'll do it myself.

535
00:47:57,764 --> 00:48:01,393
我自己解决。你要想干得好
Do it myself. You want it done right!

536
00:48:01,635 --> 00:48:04,035
就得亲自动手！
You got to do it yourself!

537
00:48:05,639 --> 00:48:07,903
这就是美式作风！
It's the American way!

538
00:48:15,115 --> 00:48:17,811
- 喂？
- 你的朋友来了吗？
-Yes?
-Did your friends make it to town?

539
00:48:18,118 --> 00:48:20,746
来了，昨晚就来了
Oh, yeah. Last night, baby.

540
00:48:21,188 --> 00:48:24,248
<i>你有说波特抢走他们的钱吗？</i>
Good. Now, did you tell them
it was Porter took that payroll?

541
00:48:24,358 --> 00:48:28,021
说了. 而且他们要报仇了
I did. And they want retribution.

542
00:48:28,795 --> 00:48:31,127
很好，就这么办吧
All right. All right. Here's what we do.

543
00:49:33,126 --> 00:49:34,388
糟糕.
Oh, shit.

544
00:49:57,217 --> 00:49:58,309
该死.
Shit.

545
00:50:03,056 --> 00:50:04,455
下次你死定了
Next time, Porter.

546
00:50:08,595 --> 00:50:11,029
看来波特交了新朋友
Looks like Porter's
made some new friends.

547
00:50:30,083 --> 00:50:32,574
- 小心点
- 我没事，我不告他们
-Easy, mister.
-I'm okay. I don't want to press charges.

548
00:50:32,686 --> 00:50:34,813
- 他们是谁？
- 不晓得，没关系
-Who were they, pal?
-I don't know. I don't know.

549
00:50:34,921 --> 00:50:37,856
我很好，我不想...
原来是你们
All right. I don't wanna...
Oh, it's you guys.

550
00:50:37,958 --> 00:50:40,859
史泰曼说你能弄到一大笔钱
Our buddy Stegman says you got a line
on a load of cash there, Porter.

551
00:50:40,961 --> 00:50:42,861
整整二十五万
250 grand, to be exact.

552
00:50:44,131 --> 00:50:45,120
七万
70.

553
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,628
- 拜托，老兄，别碰我
- 好的，好的.
-Come on, man. Get off of me.
-All right, all right, all right.

554
00:50:49,736 --> 00:50:52,296
你把我们当白痴吗？
What do you take us for, huh? ldiots?

555
00:50:52,939 --> 00:50:55,134
没有人会为了七万这么做
Nobody'd go through all this shit
for 70 grand.

556
00:50:55,242 --> 00:50:56,573
我们不喜欢麻烦，伙计
We don't like trouble, buddy.

557
00:50:56,676 --> 00:50:58,473
但你是个大麻烦
You look like a whole bunch of trouble
to us.

558
00:50:58,578 --> 00:51:00,808
有具女尸吸食海洛因
We found a dead girl full of heroin.

559
00:51:00,914 --> 00:51:02,313
现场有争斗的痕迹,
There were signs of a struggle,

560
00:51:02,416 --> 00:51:04,577
验尸官不确定是吸毒过量致死
and the coroner's not so sure
it was an OD.

561
00:51:04,684 --> 00:51:06,447
有个目击证人
We got a witness, though.

562
00:51:06,553 --> 00:51:08,418
只剩一个鼻孔
记得他吗？
A guy with only one nostril.
Remember him?

563
00:51:08,522 --> 00:51:09,511
嗯
Yeah.

564
00:51:09,623 --> 00:51:12,524
别怕，波特，我们会罩你
Hey, don't worry, Porter.
We're gonna give you immunity.

565
00:51:12,626 --> 00:51:14,924
让你作案，不怕坐牢
Room to operate,
"Get Out of Jail Free" card.

566
00:51:15,028 --> 00:51:17,496
你只要把钱给我们
All you got to do is get the money.

567
00:51:17,697 --> 00:51:19,892
我们不能帮忙
Oh, we can't help you, though.

568
00:51:20,801 --> 00:51:23,861
- 那是犯法的
- 懂了吗？波特？
-lt'd be against the law.
-You understand, Porter?

569
00:51:24,438 --> 00:51:26,668
- 那是我的钱
- 错了,波特.
-It's my money.
-Wrong, Porter.

570
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:27,932
操!
Fuck!

571
00:51:28,909 --> 00:51:31,742
那是我们的钱
我和我伙伴的
It's our money, Porter.
Me and my partner's money.

572
00:51:32,312 --> 00:51:33,904
你乖乖听话就能分一份
You be a good boy,
we'll give you a piece.

573
00:51:34,014 --> 00:51:35,413
很容易的，波特
It will be easy, Porter.

574
00:51:36,316 --> 00:51:37,647
懂不懂？
You got it?

575
00:51:37,984 --> 00:51:40,248
- 他懂啦
- 懂吗？
-Yeah, he's got it.
-You understand?

576
00:51:41,354 --> 00:51:42,878
保重，再联络
You take it easy, huh? We'll be in touch.

577
00:51:42,989 --> 00:51:44,422
好，谢了
Sure, thanks.

578
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:48,220
蠢蛋
Fuck.

579
00:52:29,603 --> 00:52:32,299
天啊，你得去看医生
Jesus Christ, Porter,
you need to see a doctor.

580
00:52:32,405 --> 00:52:33,463
是.
Yeah.

581
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:37,339
- 会有点痛
- 尽管清洗伤口，好吗？
-It's gonna sting.
-Just clean it up, all right?

582
00:52:38,445 --> 00:52:40,470
- 按住
- 好，没问题
-You hold it there.
-Yeah, right.

583
00:52:53,026 --> 00:52:54,357
让我来
I'll do it.

584
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,191
告诉我，波特
Tell me something, Porter.

585
00:53:04,604 --> 00:53:08,631
你在我们上床那晚决定走的吗
When did you decide to leave?
Was it that night we slept together?

586
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:11,099
不是
No.

587
00:53:13,547 --> 00:53:16,812
是在隔天开车送你的路上
It was the next day
when I had to drive you to work.

588
00:53:21,721 --> 00:53:24,019
你可以叫我不干
You could have asked me to quit.

589
00:53:28,195 --> 00:53:31,460
你也可以叫我送你到别处
You could have asked me to drive you
somewhere else.

590
00:53:45,458 --> 00:53:47,187
Hubba, hubba, hubba.

591
00:53:55,568 --> 00:53:56,728
谢了
Thanks.

592
00:53:57,670 --> 00:53:59,900
- 合身吗？
- 当然
-Does it fit?
-Oh, yeah.

593
00:54:00,773 --> 00:54:02,707
好像是量身订做的
Like it was made for me.

594
00:54:03,943 --> 00:54:06,241
穿着进棺材很帅
lt'll look great in your casket.

595
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:19,021
你知道吗？
You know what I think?

596
00:54:19,459 --> 00:54:23,862
我觉得你死的谣言是真的
I think that all those stories
about you being dead were true.

597
00:54:23,997 --> 00:54:26,761
你只是不肯承认
You're just too thick-headed to admit it.

598
00:54:54,961 --> 00:54:57,259
波特，我好想你
Porter. God, I missed you.

599
00:54:58,064 --> 00:54:59,531
我好想你
I missed you.

600
00:55:08,174 --> 00:55:10,506
- 别说话
- 不，我...
-Don't talk. Don't.
-Oh, no, l...

601
00:55:11,544 --> 00:55:13,409
不行，我有...
I can't. I got...

602
00:55:15,882 --> 00:55:17,679
事情要做
Stuff to do. I got...

603
00:56:01,461 --> 00:56:02,621
波特
Porter.

604
00:56:09,902 --> 00:56:11,267
他人呢？
Where is he?

605
00:56:15,141 --> 00:56:16,870
波特在哪儿？
Porter. Where is he?

606
00:56:17,677 --> 00:56:19,406
他在卧室
He's in the bedroom.

607
00:56:34,994 --> 00:56:36,484
他伤得重吗？
Is he hurt bad?

608
00:56:38,331 --> 00:56:40,891
医生马上就到
The doctor should be here any minute.

609
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,963
胡说八道
No. That's bullshit.

610
00:56:57,617 --> 00:57:00,609
我来了，老友
Porter, here I come, pally.

611
00:57:01,054 --> 00:57:02,214
波特!
Porter!

612
00:57:06,059 --> 00:57:07,526
该死
Goddamn!

613
00:57:13,232 --> 00:57:14,665
给我过来!
Get in there!

614
00:57:21,207 --> 00:57:23,175
- 他人呢？
- 他走了!
-Where is he?
-He's gone!

615
00:57:23,342 --> 00:57:25,139
他走了，他走了
He's gone. He's gone.

616
00:57:25,244 --> 00:57:26,541
走了吗？
Gone, huh?

617
00:57:30,416 --> 00:57:33,442
我认得你，你是照片上的妓女
I know you.
You're that whore from the picture.

618
00:57:35,922 --> 00:57:36,980
没错.
Yeah.

619
00:57:37,156 --> 00:57:38,919
你怎么会认识他？
How do you know him?

620
00:57:39,258 --> 00:57:41,021
他以前替我开车
He used to drive me.

621
00:57:41,794 --> 00:57:42,920
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

622
00:57:45,732 --> 00:57:48,098
我现在要替你开苞
I'm driving you now, honey.

623
00:57:49,535 --> 00:57:51,969
- 你知道你是什么吗？
- 告诉我呀
-You know what you are?
-Educate me.

624
00:57:52,071 --> 00:57:53,163
好.
Okay.

625
00:57:53,272 --> 00:57:57,003
你是专门打女人的臭猪
An ugly pig who beats up women
on account he can't get it up

626
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:59,840
你的胆量跟那话儿一样小
'cause he's too terrified
of his own fucking shadow!

627
00:57:59,946 --> 00:58:01,140
- 是吗？
- 是！
-ls that right?
-Yep!

628
00:58:01,247 --> 00:58:02,509
- 是吗？
- 是！
-ls that right?
-Yeah.

629
00:58:02,615 --> 00:58:04,776
我猜你今天一定很走运
Then I guess you must be the lucky girl.

630
00:58:07,653 --> 00:58:10,816
我要把你操得不成人形
Sweetie, I am gonna fuck you
six ways from Sunday.

631
00:58:30,109 --> 00:58:31,269
天！
Jesus.

632
00:58:34,614 --> 00:58:36,309
我忘了拿香烟
Forgot my cigarettes.

633
00:58:41,788 --> 00:58:42,880
妈的.
Shit.

634
00:58:46,959 --> 00:58:48,392
那么，瓦尔.
All right, Val.

635
00:58:49,262 --> 00:58:52,254
这个黑道组织，无所谓叫啥了
This syndicate, or outfit
or whatever the hell you call it,

636
00:58:52,365 --> 00:58:53,798
一定有个头儿，是吧？
it's got a head man, right?

637
00:58:54,634 --> 00:58:55,965
是谁？
Who is it?

638
00:58:56,369 --> 00:58:58,030
他们会宰了我，波特
They'll kill me, Porter.

639
00:58:58,137 --> 00:59:00,435
你以为我不敢杀你吗？
现实点
What do you think I'm gonna do to you?
Worry about me.

640
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:01,905
该死!
Goddamn!

641
00:59:03,075 --> 00:59:04,599
说出名字，快点
Names. Come on.

642
00:59:05,645 --> 00:59:07,078
斐法斯和卡特
Fairfax and Carter.

643
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:09,205
斐法斯和卡特在这里是老大

They run the whole city.

644
00:59:09,315 --> 00:59:10,714

645
00:59:10,817 --> 00:59:12,114
他们在哪里？
Where do I find them?

646
00:59:13,019 --> 00:59:14,919
斐法斯现在不在城里
Fairfax isn't in town right now.

647
00:59:15,588 --> 00:59:18,148
卡特呢？他在吗？在哪里？
What about Carter? Where is he?
Is he in town?

648
00:59:19,659 --> 00:59:22,059
找他也没有用
Porter, it won't do you any good.

649
00:59:22,161 --> 00:59:24,595
他们会.. 天! 你...
They're gonna... Jesus! You...

650
00:59:26,532 --> 00:59:30,798

654
00:59:42,882 --> 00:59:46,943
你是个疯子，为了七万甘愿卯上黑道
You're fucking nuts going up
against the outfit for 70 grand,

655
00:59:47,053 --> 00:59:49,248
- 不过我帮你

谢了. 我...

00:59:57,730 --> 01:00:00,961
那里防守严密，我带你进去
I can get you in there.
Place is tighter than a drum.

659
01:00:01,067 --> 01:00:03,433
- 有几名守卫？
- 不过，呃...
-How many guys in there?
-But, well...

660
01:00:03,536 --> 01:00:05,094
多得数不完
It's tighter than hell.

661
01:00:05,204 --> 01:00:07,172
外面只有一个
They got only one guy
on the outside, though,

662
01:00:07,273 --> 01:00:09,104
我带你绕进去
so I got a way around...

663
01:00:12,612 --> 01:00:16,742
你疯了
你这个疯子够变态
You are crazy.
You are a crazy son of a bitch.

664
01:00:17,149 --> 01:00:18,946
- 所以我才爱你
- 呵.
-That's why I love you.
-Yep.

665
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:22,486
- 有打火机吗？
- 我...什么?
-You got a light?
-l... What?

666
01:00:22,889 --> 01:00:24,186
有火吗？
You got a light?

667
01:00:26,525 --> 01:00:28,288
没有...没有...
No. No.

668
01:00:28,928 --> 01:00:31,123
- 那你还有什么用？
- 等等!
-Well, then what good are you?
-Wait!

669
01:00:54,754 --> 01:00:55,880
萝丝
Rosie.

670
01:00:56,956 --> 01:00:58,048
萝丝
Rosie.

671
01:01:00,092 --> 01:01:02,026
租约用你的名字吗？
Is your name on the lease here?

672
01:01:06,666 --> 01:01:09,157
黑道，都是黑道出的钱
The outfit.
The outfit pays for everything.

673
01:01:10,803 --> 01:01:13,772
我要你收拾贵重的物品
I want you to gather everything up
that you need,

674
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,871
离开这地方
say goodbye to this place.

675
01:01:16,709 --> 01:01:17,801
好吗?
Okay?

676
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:54,911
- 我告诉过你他会来的.
- 把那该死的钱给我.
-I told you he'd show up.
-Give me my goddamn money, please.

677
01:01:55,014 --> 01:01:56,641
嗯，把钱也给我
Yeah, give me my money, too.

678
01:01:57,049 --> 01:01:59,984
把那该死的钱给我.
Give me my goddamn money, please.

679
01:02:00,086 --> 01:02:02,145
- 那是他吗？
- 是的，快
-Sure that's him?
-Yeah, that's him, come on.

680
01:02:03,489 --> 01:02:04,751
- 非常感谢
- 谢谢.
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

681
01:02:04,857 --> 01:02:06,757
你来说吧
Yeah, there you go.

682
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:10,488
- 怎么样了，哥们
- 我们的钱在里面
-What you up to, buddy?
-Well, our money's in there

683
01:02:12,031 --> 01:02:13,191
如果你还感兴趣的话
if you're still interested.

684
01:02:13,299 --> 01:02:17,167
我想要的是用钱买的船
Well, not in the dough
but the boat I'm gonna buy with it.

685
01:02:20,606 --> 01:02:24,804
- 他在这儿干嘛？
- 见者有份，波特
-What's he doing here?
-It's a ride-along, Porter.

686
01:02:25,077 --> 01:02:28,012
你的份越来越小了
You see, your piece of the pie
just got a little smaller.

687
01:02:28,114 --> 01:02:30,548
别怕，我会留点渣给你
But don't worry,
I'll leave you some crust.

688
01:02:32,885 --> 01:02:36,912
你还等什么？快去拿钱呀
去拿我们的钱
What are you waiting for, Porter?
Go get it. Go get our money.

689
01:02:39,291 --> 01:02:42,488
- 帮个忙好吗？
- 我们很乐意帮忙
-You guys do me a favor?
-We're here to help, buddy.

690
01:02:43,362 --> 01:02:45,353
当我进去时，我会被搜身
Well, they're probably gonna frisk me
when I go in there,

691
01:02:45,464 --> 01:02:47,955
帮我保管一下
so I wonder if you wouldn't mind
holding on to this.

692
01:02:48,067 --> 01:02:49,193
天啊
Jesus.

693
01:02:49,902 --> 01:02:51,893
只要一会
You know, just for a little while.

694
01:02:53,272 --> 01:02:54,432
好吧，波特
Sure, Porter.

695
01:02:57,643 --> 01:02:59,907
好枪
Hey, nice balance.

696
01:03:03,549 --> 01:03:04,607
臭小子.
Douche bag.

697
01:03:13,993 --> 01:03:15,221
我能帮什么忙？
Can I help you?

698
01:03:16,062 --> 01:03:18,826
- 我要见卡特先生.
- 你是谁？
-Yeah, I want to see Mr. Carter.
-And who are you?

699
01:03:19,665 --> 01:03:22,225
就说是我干掉瓦尔
Tell him I'm the guy
that whacked Val Resnick.

700
01:03:22,535 --> 01:03:23,729
抱歉, 我没...
I'm sorry, I don't...

701
01:03:25,538 --> 01:03:27,130
我没听到，请重复
Didn't copy. Repeat.

702
01:03:31,343 --> 01:03:32,503
好
Right.

703
01:03:34,013 --> 01:03:37,380
卡特先生要见你，让我搜身
Mr. Carter will see you.
Turn around so I can frisk you.

704
01:03:41,854 --> 01:03:43,583
你把瓦尔干掉了?
So you popped old Val, huh?

705
01:03:45,658 --> 01:03:47,683
谢谢，左边口袋
Thanks. Left pocket.

706
01:03:52,231 --> 01:03:54,699
- 要拿着吗
- 是的，它会帮点小忙
-Saving up?
-Yeah, every little bit helps.

707
01:03:56,001 --> 01:03:57,059
跟我来
Follow me.

708
01:04:18,858 --> 01:04:20,519
干得好. 坐下
Bravo. Sit down.

709
01:04:26,932 --> 01:04:29,025
我要称赞你
他们2个是好手
My compliments.
They were two of my best.

710
01:04:29,135 --> 01:04:31,194
不，他们都太逊了
No, they lull too easy.

711
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:39,272
48.
48.

712
01:04:44,383 --> 01:04:46,078
你想向我要什么
There's something you want from me.

713
01:04:46,185 --> 01:04:49,416
瓦尔雷斯尼克给你十三万
Val Resnick gave you $1 30,000.

714
01:04:49,522 --> 01:04:51,080
那是他欠我们的债
Paid us. It was a debt.

715
01:04:52,391 --> 01:04:55,292
七万是我的，我要讨回来
Well, $70,000 of it was mine,
and I want it back.

716
01:04:56,862 --> 01:05:00,457
抱歉，雷斯尼克跟我说过，不过我忘了你叫什么
I'm sorry. Resnick told me, but
I seem to have misplaced your name.

717
01:05:00,566 --> 01:05:02,761
- 波特
- 波特，是的.
-Porter.
-Porter. Right.

718
01:05:03,269 --> 01:05:04,930
我不会再忘记的
I won't forget it again.

719
01:05:06,138 --> 01:05:08,436
我们不是不讲道理，波特
The outfit is not unreasonable, Porter,

720
01:05:09,508 --> 01:05:13,103
不过谁也不会同意你的要求
but no corporation in the world
would agree to what you're asking.

721
01:05:13,212 --> 01:05:15,840
斐法斯会还钱吗？
What about Fairfax?
Will he give me my money?

722
01:05:16,782 --> 01:05:19,182
雷斯尼克真多嘴
Resnick told you quite a bit, didn't he?

723
01:05:19,285 --> 01:05:21,219
斐法斯也会这么说
Fairfax will tell you
the same thing I have.

724
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:23,618
我们不能做这种决定
We're not authorized
to do things like this.

725
01:05:23,722 --> 01:05:26,714
- 谁？谁能做决定？
- 委员会
-Who is? Who makes the decisions?
-Well, a committee would make

726
01:05:26,825 --> 01:05:29,385
- 得投票表决.
- 不，肯定有一个人可以.
-a decision in this case.
-No, no. One man.

727
01:05:29,495 --> 01:05:32,020
你已经是高层了，一定能接触那个人，谁？
You go high enough,
you always come to one man. Who?

728
01:05:43,709 --> 01:05:46,610
是的, 弗里德卡特
我要和布朗森先生通话
Yeah, Fred Carter.
I wanna talk to Bronson.

729
01:05:51,850 --> 01:05:55,286
对不起打扰你了，有个事...
Yeah, sorry to bother you,
but I have a problem.

730
01:05:55,754 --> 01:05:58,279
有个家伙在我的办公室里拿着枪要杀了我
There's a man in my office with a gun
who says he's gonna kill me

731
01:05:58,390 --> 01:06:01,052
如果组织不给他13万美金的话...
if the outfit doesn't pay him $130,000...

732
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:05,119
7万，是7万...让我和他说话
$70,000. It's 70... Let me talk to him.

733
01:06:07,233 --> 01:06:08,222
她。
Her.

734
01:06:12,972 --> 01:06:14,633
他想和你通话
He wants to speak to you.

735
01:06:18,277 --> 01:06:19,369
免提
The speaker.

736
01:06:26,352 --> 01:06:27,751
<i>我是布朗森.</i>
This is Bronson.

737
01:06:27,853 --> 01:06:30,447
这个叫卡特的人对你值多少钱?
How much is this guy Carter
worth to you?

738
01:06:30,556 --> 01:06:32,854
<i>多少钱？你什么意思？</i>
Worth? What do you mean?

739
01:06:32,958 --> 01:06:35,358
要么我拿回我的钱，要么卡特死掉
Well, either I get my money,
or I'll kill Carter.

740
01:06:36,395 --> 01:06:37,828
<i>我不喜欢被人威胁.</i>
I don't like to be threatened.

741
01:06:37,930 --> 01:06:39,989
我不是威胁你,
我是在威胁卡特先生.
I'm not threatening you,
I'm threatening Carter.

742
01:06:40,099 --> 01:06:41,088
真的?
Touche.

743
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,293
<i>有胆子！你是谁？</i>
An audacious man. Who are you?

744
01:06:43,802 --> 01:06:45,565
我的钱，给不给？
My money, yes or no?

745
01:06:47,706 --> 01:06:48,695
<i>不给.</i>
No.

746
01:06:52,411 --> 01:06:54,675
<i>卡特? 卡特?</i>
Carter? Carter?

747
01:06:55,714 --> 01:06:57,375
<i>卡特，发生什么事了？</i>
Carter, what's happening?

748
01:06:58,450 --> 01:07:01,010
<i>快派人去商业大道，快！</i>
Get some people down
to Commerce street. Now.

749
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:02,412
<i>卡特?</i>
Carter?

750
01:07:03,422 --> 01:07:05,549
<i>说话，卡特？</i>
Speak to me. Carter?

751
01:07:05,658 --> 01:07:08,650
你还是没搞懂，你这个蠢蛋
You just don't get it, do you,
you dumb fuck?

752
01:07:10,195 --> 01:07:12,720
<i>我希望你是对他说的不是对我说.</i>
I sure hope you're talking to him
and not me.

753
01:07:12,831 --> 01:07:14,799
<i>卡特？卡特！</i>
Carter! Carter!

754
01:07:14,933 --> 01:07:16,059
我刚把他杀了
I just croaked Carter.

755
01:07:16,168 --> 01:07:18,398
我希望你能通知斐法斯，告诉他
I want you to call Fairfax
and tell him that.

756
01:07:18,504 --> 01:07:20,335
<i>自己去舔屁眼吧，混蛋.</i>
Smoke them if you got 'em, asshole.

757
01:07:20,906 --> 01:07:22,999
<i>你活不过24小时.</i>
You've got 24 hours left to breathe.

758
01:07:23,108 --> 01:07:26,373
<i>明天找人收尸吧.</i>
That's one day to get
your tiny little world in order.

759
01:07:26,478 --> 01:07:29,276
<i>听到了没有，宝贝，嗯？</i>
Do you understand that, sweetheart?
Do you?

760
01:07:29,815 --> 01:07:32,010
波特，波特，波特，把钱给我
Porter, Porter, Porter, get my money.

761
01:07:32,718 --> 01:07:35,084
- 我看到他了，我看到他了，我看到他了
- 赶紧，赶紧，赶紧
-I see him, I see him, I see him.
-Come on, come on, come on.

762
01:07:35,187 --> 01:07:36,347
就在这里
Right here.

763
01:07:39,024 --> 01:07:41,891
- 我没看到现金.
- 他们写的支票？
-I don't see any cash.
-They write you a check?

764
01:07:42,328 --> 01:07:45,092
我被耍了，我得见另一个人
They gave me the run around.
I have to go and see another guy.

765
01:07:45,197 --> 01:07:47,757
最后一次机会，否则我们就得找你问女尸的事
Last one, then we got a dead woman,
an assault,

766
01:07:47,866 --> 01:07:50,460
所有的证据都指向你
and all kinds of stuff
to talk to you about.

767
01:07:50,569 --> 01:07:54,027
需要做很多报告，波特
我们很不想处理这么多公文
That means more paperwork, Porter,
and we don't like paperwork.

768
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:58,638
真可惜，波特
别这么垂头丧气
Damn shame, Porter,
but don't let the bastards get you down.

769
01:08:00,012 --> 01:08:02,446
没错，波特，别放弃
That's right, Porter. Don't give up.

770
01:08:05,718 --> 01:08:08,414
- 把枪还给我
- 好
-Hey, can I have my piece back?
-Oh, yeah.

771
01:08:17,229 --> 01:08:21,188
好棒的枪
重得可以当钳子用
Nice roscoe, Porter.
Heavy enough to be a nutcracker.

772
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:23,061
再联络，洛基
We'll be in touch, Rocky.

773
01:08:25,371 --> 01:08:26,895
继续好好努力
Keep up the good work.

774
01:08:27,039 --> 01:08:29,166
洛基? 这是啥意思?
Rocky? Where did you get Rocky from?

775
01:08:29,274 --> 01:08:32,107
<i>动画片里的一只松鼠《洛基和布温克》</i>
Squirrel on the cartoon.
Rocky and Bullwinkle.

776
01:09:20,225 --> 01:09:22,523
欢迎回来，斐法斯先生
Good to have you back in town,
Mr. Fairfax.

777
01:09:22,628 --> 01:09:24,289
高兴才怪
I wish I could say I was glad to be back.

778
01:09:24,396 --> 01:09:26,956
我本应今早上和海豚一起戏水
I was swimming with the dolphins
this morning.

779
01:09:28,734 --> 01:09:29,758
轻点，行不？
Easy, would you?

780
01:09:29,868 --> 01:09:32,666
这可是真品鳄鱼皮箱，老天，你小心点
It's genuine alligator, for God's sake.
What's the matter with you?

781
01:09:32,771 --> 01:09:34,466
对不起，斐法斯先生
Sorry, Mr. Fairfax.

782
01:09:35,641 --> 01:09:37,905
- 你好，斐法斯先生
- 怎么了，查理
-Hello, Mr. Fairfax.
-How's it going, Charlie?

783
01:09:42,281 --> 01:09:43,942
我们和另外两个警探
Well, between us
and our neighborhood cops,

784
01:09:44,049 --> 01:09:46,540
把波特盯死了
I'd say we got him
pretty well covered, huh?

785
01:09:47,753 --> 01:09:49,220
华特，醒醒
Walter, wake up.

786
01:09:51,490 --> 01:09:52,650
华特!
Walter!

787
01:09:53,258 --> 01:09:54,418
醒醒!
Wake up!

788
01:09:55,461 --> 01:09:57,122
把箱子举高，两位
Keep those bags up, boys.

789
01:09:58,163 --> 01:10:01,621
- 你是什么人？
- 你为了我提早回来
-Who the hell are you?
-I'm the reason you're back early.

790
01:10:03,368 --> 01:10:04,892
- 你是波特？
- 正是在下。
-You're Porter?
-That's right.

791
01:10:05,003 --> 01:10:06,834
拿箱子的手要平举
Keep those bags up above
shoulder level, boys.

792
01:10:06,939 --> 01:10:08,668
否则我就开枪
You drop them and I'll drill you.

793
01:10:12,344 --> 01:10:15,472
怎么？你要我倒立吗？
Well, what'll you have me do,
stand on my head?

794
01:10:16,114 --> 01:10:19,550
不是我要你帮我个忙
打电话给布朗森先生
No. I want you to do me a favor
and call Mrs. Bronson,

795
01:10:19,651 --> 01:10:21,778
一起商量一下钱的事
see what we can do about my money.

796
01:10:21,887 --> 01:10:24,856
哦，她让卡特送死
Well, she let Carter die.

797
01:10:25,324 --> 01:10:29,055
那个暴牙老爹死得好
But that poor buck-toothed bastard
is probably better off dead anyway.

798
01:10:29,962 --> 01:10:31,896
她或许也会让我死
She'd probably let me die, too.

799
01:10:31,997 --> 01:10:34,124
不，上次她以为我在虚张声势
No, with Carter
she thought I was bluffing.

800
01:10:37,302 --> 01:10:38,496
试试看
Try her.

801
01:10:39,338 --> 01:10:40,396
好吧
All right.

802
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:43,767
你们两个被开除了
You two are fired.

803
01:10:47,346 --> 01:10:49,837
喂? 是这样子的
Hello? Yes, it's like this.

804
01:10:50,415 --> 01:10:53,407
我的客厅有个叫波特的人
I'm standing in my living room
and there's a man here named Porter

805
01:10:53,519 --> 01:10:56,886
他说你迟早得付钱给他
who says that he expects you
to pay him sooner or later.

806
01:10:58,223 --> 01:10:59,656
当然
Yes, of course.

807
01:11:00,692 --> 01:11:03,718
- 她想跟你讲话
- 用免提
-She wants to talk to you.
-Put her on the speaker.

808
01:11:10,068 --> 01:11:11,296
我是波特
This is Porter.

809
01:11:11,403 --> 01:11:13,530
<i>我想你可以干掉斐法斯</i>
I should probably have you
just shoot Fairfax

810
01:11:13,639 --> 01:11:16,199
<i>然后我雇你替代他们.</i>
and then hire you to run the city for me.

811
01:11:16,308 --> 01:11:19,766
<i>不过你这家伙没脑子。</i>
Too bad you're just a punk
with the right balls-to-brains ratio.

812
01:11:20,379 --> 01:11:24,042
<i>亲爱的，我不会付你十三万</i>
Honey, I wouldn't even
get out of bed for 1 30 grand.

813
01:11:24,349 --> 01:11:26,840
你的人听错了，不是13万...
You people aren't listening.
It's not 1 30 grand...

814
01:11:26,952 --> 01:11:30,444
<i>不，你听着，你将无处可逃.</i>
No, you listen.
You got no place to go, Porter.

815
01:11:30,856 --> 01:11:33,791
<i>你完了，明白我说的吗？</i>
You're finished.
Do you get what I'm talking about?

816
01:11:35,127 --> 01:11:36,185
<i>斐法斯？</i>
Fairfax?

817
01:11:36,328 --> 01:11:38,319
<i>- 你在干嘛？
- 斐法斯？</i>
-Hey, what the hell are you doing, man?
-Fairfax?

818
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:40,864
<i>- 你没事吧
- 没事.</i>
-Are you okay?
-Yes. No, it's all right.

819
01:11:40,966 --> 01:11:44,800
他把我的鳄鱼皮箱打穿了，给我的衣服开了个洞
He's just killing my alligator bags
and shooting holes in my suit.

820
01:11:44,903 --> 01:11:48,031
<i>- 只是说说
- 好，波特，我认输.</i>
-Man, that's just mean.
-Okay, Porter, I give up.

821
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:50,174
<i>在哪里把钱给你？</i>
Where do you wanna
pick up your money?

822
01:11:51,176 --> 01:11:52,541
王十字车站.
King's Cross Station.

823
01:11:52,644 --> 01:11:55,738
派一个人，蓝色背包装满现金
Send one man
with a blue backpack full of cash.

824
01:11:56,081 --> 01:11:57,878
我会在月台.
I'll be on the platform.

825
01:11:58,116 --> 01:12:01,711
<i>- 车站名是什么?
- 到此为止.</i>
-What's the name of the stop?
-It's the end of the line.

826
01:12:02,621 --> 01:12:04,282
<i>你也一样，甜心.</i>
For you, too, sweetheart.

827
01:12:10,062 --> 01:12:12,553
你为了13万美元签死刑.
You just signed your own death warrant
for $1 30,000.

828
01:12:12,664 --> 01:12:17,328
我不明白，这算啥？
为了原则吗？
I don't... I don't get that. What is it,
the principle or something, huh?

829
01:12:17,903 --> 01:12:20,428
不，我只想要回我的钱
No, I just want my money back.

830
01:12:26,612 --> 01:12:28,409
只是70
And it's only 70.

831
01:12:29,014 --> 01:12:31,778
70? 你说什么，只是70?
70? What do you mean it's only 70?

832
01:12:32,217 --> 01:12:34,014
7万?
Only 70,000?

833
01:12:34,753 --> 01:12:36,812
该死，我的西装都不只七万
Hell, my suits are worth more than that.

834
01:12:37,589 --> 01:12:40,524
听好了 “欧森雷桑德斯”号
Listen to this. "Ocean Ray Sundancer.

835
01:12:41,026 --> 01:12:45,258
"真空吸水马桶. 80,000元."
"Vacuum-flush head. 80,000 bucks."

836
01:12:47,299 --> 01:12:49,392
我告诉你，他肯定拿不到钱
I'm telling you, you ain't gonna have it.

837
01:12:49,501 --> 01:12:52,629
- 你想打赌吗？
- 不，我才不想赌
-You wanna bet?
-No, I don't wanna bet.

838
01:12:53,171 --> 01:12:54,866
我已经输了一百五
I'm out $150 already.

839
01:12:56,341 --> 01:13:00,505
一百五买不了船
他最好拿到钱
$150 I'm getting my damn boat.
Better come down with something.

840
01:13:00,612 --> 01:13:01,977
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

841
01:13:02,714 --> 01:13:04,477
希克、李瑞
Hicks, Leary,

842
01:13:04,583 --> 01:13:07,848
我们是荷伦和范欧文
内务部的
we're Holland and Vanowen.
lnternal Affairs.

843
01:13:10,689 --> 01:13:13,123
别找碴，我们在盯梢
You boys wanna back off?
We're on a stakeout here.

844
01:13:13,225 --> 01:13:16,194
- 请你们下车
- 干什么？
-You wanna step out of the car, please?
-What for?

845
01:13:16,294 --> 01:13:18,728
两位警探，你们最好下车
I think you better
step out of the car, Detectives.

846
01:13:29,941 --> 01:13:32,842
- 到底是怎么回事？
- 我不知道
-What the hell's going on?
-I don't know.

847
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:36,978
这是你的警徽吗？探长？
你报失的那枚
Is this your badge, Detective?
The one you reported missing?

848
01:13:39,484 --> 01:13:42,544
- 是，在哪儿找到的？
- 你在哪儿弄丢的？
-Yeah. Where'd you find it?
-Where exactly did you lose it?

849
01:13:46,324 --> 01:13:47,951
这是你的吗？
Does this belong to you?

850
01:13:53,665 --> 01:13:56,998
- 是波特，跟上去
- 我会跟着他
-It's Porter. Follow him.
-I got that motherfucker.

851
01:14:07,446 --> 01:14:08,504
嘿.
Hey.

852
01:14:14,252 --> 01:14:15,719
波特，上车
Get in, Porter.

853
01:14:22,427 --> 01:14:23,689
关上车门
Close the door.

854
01:14:25,163 --> 01:14:27,256
把枪放在地板上
Now set the roscoe on the floor.

855
01:14:29,401 --> 01:14:30,493
慢慢来
Slow.

856
01:14:34,806 --> 01:14:38,674
我要把你交给黑道换奖赏
See, I am gonna turn you in
to the outfit for a reward.

857
01:14:38,877 --> 01:14:41,675
也许他们会让我加入
And maybe they'll be so impressed
that they'll ask me to join,

858
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:43,509
这样我就发达了
and I'll be on easy street.

859
01:14:43,815 --> 01:14:45,783
又有医疗、牙医保险
Medical, dental.

860
01:14:46,985 --> 01:14:49,647
我要亲自把你送上门
I'm just... I'm gonna walk you right in.

861
01:14:49,888 --> 01:14:51,617
活捉波特
Porter on the hoof.

862
01:14:52,157 --> 01:14:54,091
除非你敢乱来
Unless you get rambunctious.

863
01:14:54,192 --> 01:14:57,286
我就得把你做掉..
Then I'll just have
to take care of you myself...

864
01:14:59,998 --> 01:15:02,398
你不会杀我吧？
You're not gonna fucking kill me,
are you?

865
01:15:09,474 --> 01:15:10,702
放开他
Let him go.

866
01:15:12,544 --> 01:15:13,636
快点.
Now.

867
01:15:19,284 --> 01:15:20,808
Hubba, hubba, hubba.

868
01:16:48,907 --> 01:16:52,172
嘿， 波特！
Hey. Hey. Hey, Porter!

869
01:16:52,677 --> 01:16:53,701
嘿!
Hey!

870
01:16:54,846 --> 01:16:56,279
来啊!
Hey, come on!

871
01:17:23,408 --> 01:17:26,343
嘿，帅哥，这里是装货场
Hey, handsome. This is a loading zone.

872
01:17:27,712 --> 01:17:29,043
来我离开.
So move me.

873
01:17:30,282 --> 01:17:31,442
当然.
So move.

874
01:17:32,684 --> 01:17:33,878
你是波特?
You Porter?

875
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:36,945
转弯开到你兄弟那里.
Over there by your buddy. U-turn.

876
01:17:58,610 --> 01:18:00,805
我们有新位置，进来.
We're taking a new position. Get in.

877
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:11,818
- 哪里
- 想活命就老实点
-Where to?
-Relax and you'll survive this.

878
01:18:12,424 --> 01:18:15,154
把你的手放到我可以看到的地方.
下个路口左转.
Keep your hands where I can see them.
Take the next left.

879
01:18:22,167 --> 01:18:25,330
我想我办过你.
You know, I think I fucked you once.

880
01:18:26,471 --> 01:18:27,597
哦，是吗？
Oh, yeah?

881
01:18:31,543 --> 01:18:33,534
你觉得还有第二次吗?
What do you think
the odds are on twice?

882
01:18:38,049 --> 01:18:41,485
- 10分钟内在L处集合.
- 我会的.
-I'll meet you at the L in 10 minutes.
-I'll be there.

883
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:50,389
我不认为你有机会.
I don't think your odds are good.

884
01:18:53,431 --> 01:18:55,058
你还有什么要说的吗？
You got anything to say?

885
01:18:55,867 --> 01:18:57,357
没有，谢谢.
No, thank you.

886
01:18:57,969 --> 01:18:59,402
那就老实待在这里.
Then just stay here.

887
01:19:25,563 --> 01:19:26,689
别动
Don't move.

888
01:19:27,632 --> 01:19:29,657
还有其他的人在这里吗？
You got any friends here
I should know about?

889
01:19:29,768 --> 01:19:31,633
男厕所
You should try the men's room.

890
01:20:28,226 --> 01:20:29,250
嗨
Hey.

891
01:20:31,362 --> 01:20:32,420
波特？
Porter?

892
01:20:40,138 --> 01:20:42,629
过来这里
Step back here. Come on.

893
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:04,053
那个人说你应该喝这个
The guy says you should drink this.

894
01:21:04,362 --> 01:21:06,023
- 谁？
- 我。
-What guy?
-Me.

895
01:21:06,164 --> 01:21:07,893
用右手拿
Take it in your right hand.

896
01:21:10,869 --> 01:21:12,336
坐下
Sit down.

897
01:21:14,772 --> 01:21:16,171
你们的枪呢？
Where's your piece?

898
01:21:16,708 --> 01:21:18,505
- 午餐盒.
- 打开它
-Lunchbox.
-Open it.

899
01:21:21,346 --> 01:21:22,438
关上吧
Close it.

900
01:21:38,229 --> 01:21:39,526
上火车
Get on the train.

901
01:22:34,619 --> 01:22:35,643
干什么...
What...

902
01:22:55,139 --> 01:22:56,299
钱在这里
Here it is.

903
01:23:03,014 --> 01:23:04,072
打开
Open it.

904
01:23:05,016 --> 01:23:07,143
全都在这里了，13万
It's all there. 130 grand.

905
01:23:07,285 --> 01:23:09,845
7万，你这个蠢蛋，打开它
It's 70, you dumb bastards. Open it.

906
01:24:00,204 --> 01:24:01,501
嗨，菲尔
Hey, Phil.

907
01:24:07,412 --> 01:24:09,676
天啊，他怎么做到的？
Jesus, how'd he make it?

908
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:17,112
快点！闪开！
Come on! Move it!

909
01:24:51,956 --> 01:24:54,720
<i>你觉得你可以搞定任何事，是不是？</i>
You think you can make
everything okay, don't you?

910
01:24:55,827 --> 01:24:57,795
<i>你有多彪悍，波特？</i>
How strong are you, Porter?

911
01:24:58,329 --> 01:25:01,025
<i>听着可能有点疯狂，不过...</i>
You know, this may sound crazy,
Porter, but...

912
01:25:01,165 --> 01:25:02,826
<i>你不会得到的，你个..</i>
You just don't get it, do you, you dumb...

913
01:25:03,768 --> 01:25:05,292
<i>我们星期五下手.</i>
We'll hit them on Friday.

914

<i>有人该给我颁哲学博士学位</i>
Someone ought to give me a PhD.

915

916
01:25:09,907 --> 01:25:12,432
<i>求你了，答应我</i>
Please. Allow me.

917
01:25:12,577 --> 01:25:15,740
<i>这算什么？为了原则吗？</i>
What is it,
the principle or something, huh?

918
01:25:15,847 --> 01:25:17,439
<i>你这死人气色挺好的</i>
You look pretty good for a dead guy.

919
01:25:17,782 --> 01:25:19,750
快点，亲爱的，我们要离开这里
Come on, baby,
we got to get you out of here.

920
01:25:19,851 --> 01:25:22,513
快点，我们得走了
Come with me.
Come on, baby, we gotta go.

921
01:25:22,987 --> 01:25:26,923
波特？醒醒！快点！
Come on. Porter? Come on! Come on!

922
01:25:27,358 --> 01:25:28,586
波特？
