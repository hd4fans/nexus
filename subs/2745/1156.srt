00:00:08,578 --> 00:00:12,093
Live from the Dolby Theatre
in Hollywood and Highland,

2
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:14,171
it¡¯s the Oscars!

3
00:00:14,497 --> 00:00:18,331
Ladies and Gentlemen,
please welcome your host,

4
00:00:18,402 --> 00:00:20,734
Ellen DeGeneres!

5
00:00:25,044 --> 00:00:29,014
Thank you. Thank you very much.

6
00:00:35,293 --> 00:00:36,737
Thank you very much.

7
00:00:46,605 --> 00:00:48,300
Thank you very much. Thanks.

8
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,688
Thanks so much. Welcome to the Oscars.

9
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,055
For those of you watching around the world,

10
00:00:53,091 --> 00:00:55,377
it has been a tough couple
of days f or us here.

11
00:00:55,499 --> 00:00:56,659
It has been raining.

12
00:00:59,294 --> 00:01:00,500
Were fine.

13
00:01:02,091 --> 00:01:03,501
Thank you for your prayers.

14
00:01:06,371 --> 00:01:08,942
Tm happy to be back.
I hosted seven years ago

15
00:01:09,011 --> 00:01:12,424
and I¡¯m so honoured and flattered
that they have been back so quickly.

16
00:01:19,966 --> 00:01:21,046
Things are so different now.

17
00:01:21,138 --> 00:01:23,538
Last time, for instance, when I was here,

18
00:01:23,606 --> 00:01:26,507
Cate Blanchett was nominated,
Meryl Streep was nominated,

19
00:01:27,575 --> 00:01:31,045
Leonardo DiCaprio was nominated,
Martin Scorsese was nominated.

20
00:01:31,089 --> 00:01:31,965
So different.

21
00:01:34,684 --> 00:01:36,504
There are some first time nominees
here tonight.

22
00:01:36,576 --> 00:01:39,329
June Squibb is nominated for Nebraska.

23
00:01:44,887 --> 00:01:48,095
At 84 years old, she is the oldest nominee.

24
00:01:48,137 --> 00:01:49,786
She was wonderful in ¡°Nebraska¡¯.

25
00:01:55,417 --> 00:01:58,454
Tm telling everyone that
you were wonderful in Nebraska¡¯.

26
00:01:58,887 --> 00:02:01,219
The film that you did ... wonderful.

27
00:02:06,779 --> 00:02:08,326
We have other first time nominees.

28
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,944
Lupita Nyongo is here. Amazing.

29
00:02:16,684 --> 00:02:20,654
anazing performance in
¡®12 Years a Slave¡¯.

30
00:02:20,693 --> 00:02:22,684
She is from Kenya, she is a Kenyan.

31
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,460
Md Barkhard Abdi is here.

32
00:02:25,498 --> 00:02:28,149
He is nominated for Captain Phillips.

33
00:02:32,888 --> 00:02:35,425
He¡¯s from Somalia, he is a sommelier,

34
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:39,417
so he knows a lot about wine
and that is impressive.

35
00:02:42,527 --> 00:02:44,427
Whos the wine captain now?

36
00:02:46,809 --> 00:02:50,017
Whos the wine captain, now?

37
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,899
The real Captain Phillips is here tonight

38
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:56,709
and the real Philomena is here tonight.

39
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:08,738
Mdl have to say one of the most amazing
Liza Minnelli impersonators

40
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,335
lye ever seen in my entire life.

41
00:03:11,373 --> 00:03:14,069
Just, really, seriously.

42
00:03:16,138 --> 00:03:18,584
Good job, sir. I mean, that is really

43
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:21,702
thats

44
00:03:29,887 --> 00:03:31,787
Tonights theme is Heroes in Hollood

45
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:33,889
and we need heroes now more than ever.

46
00:03:33,935 --> 00:03:35,891
People around the world
are going through hard times

47
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:39,141
and movies offer us an escape.

48
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:40,497
Movies inspire us.

49
00:03:40,607 --> 00:03:43,303
Tm not saying that movies
are the most important thing in the world

50
00:03:43,341 --> 00:03:46,424
because we all know the most important
thing in the world is yooth.

51
00:03:49,886 --> 00:03:52,605
Now, we know that the most important thing
in life is love

52
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,460
and friendship and family,

53
00:03:55,576 --> 00:03:58,227
and if people don¡¯t have those things,
well, then,

54
00:03:58,341 --> 00:04:01,014
they usually get into show business. So...

55
00:04:03,888 --> 00:04:07,426
Here we all, were one big frightened family
is what we are,

56
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:09,529
but I want you to know that I love you

57
00:04:09,606 --> 00:04:12,097
and I think ynure talented. I do.

58
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,346
Md I think you should think of yourselves
as winners.

59
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:17,066
Not all of you,

60
00:04:17,137 --> 00:04:21,221
but the people who have won before
should think 0f yourselves as winners.

61
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:22,421
Mdl know what you¡¯re thinking:

62
00:04:22,498 --> 00:04:23,704
Ellen, that¡¯s easy for yoo to say,

63
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,530
youve been chosen the host

64
00:04:24,608 --> 00:04:26,735
and thats sort of the highest award
there is.

65
00:04:27,294 --> 00:04:31,503
Thank you. Thank you.

66
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:38,538
But lets try to focus on you tonight,
if we can.

67
00:04:38,606 --> 00:04:40,460
Seriously, the work that you¡¯ve done
is incredible,

68
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:41,712
and I did a little bit of research,

69
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:44,380
and between all of the nominees
here tonight,

70
00:04:44,499 --> 00:04:47,093
youve made over 1400 films.

71
00:04:47,217 --> 00:04:50,983
1400 films, and you¡¯ve gone to
a total 0f sio years of college.

72
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,986
I¡¯m kidding. Kids, stay in school.

73
00:04:59,059 --> 00:05:01,710
I¡¯m sure these people went to college.

74
00:05:01,809 --> 00:05:04,528
I mean, Amy Adams,
you went to college, right?

75
00:05:04,934 --> 00:05:05,377
No.

76
00:05:05,451 --> 00:05:06,736
Well ... who cares?!

77
00:05:07,857 --> 00:05:08,733
You¡¯re an amazing actress.

78
00:05:08,811 --> 00:05:12,577
You¡¯re in, not one, but two nominated films
tonight you were in.

79
00:05:12,617 --> 00:05:13,663
That¡¯s just

80
00:05:17,576 --> 00:05:20,147
That is so, what is the word for it

81
00:05:20,215 --> 00:05:21,500
selfish, I guess.

82
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:26,350
I really do think its
an exceptional year for movies,

83
00:05:26,418 --> 00:05:28,989
of course, one of the nominees is ¡®Her¡¯,

84
00:05:29,091 --> 00:05:31,139
and by her, I mean Meryl Streep.

85
00:05:34,983 --> 00:05:39,784
Meryl has been nominated
for an Oscar a total of 18 times.

86
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:49,063
Now it sounds good,
but if you do the math,

87
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:52,500
between dresses, hair and makeup,
that¡¯s hundreds of thousands of dollars.

88
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,499
Simply put, Meryl cannot
afford to be nominated again.

89
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:58,019
That is...a lot of money.

90
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:02,143
Tm listing all these people like
youre up against each other...

91
00:06:02,217 --> 00:06:05,061
and ynure all so talented
I dont want you to think 0f

92
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:07,420
any kind of a competition.
Its a celebration.

93
00:06:07,981 --> 00:06:09,892
PJthough who are we kidding?
Its the Hunger Games.

94
00:06:09,934 --> 00:06:11,731
I mean there are cameras evernhere.
Ynure starving.

95
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:14,896
Jennifer Lawrence won last year.
It is the Hunger Games.

96
00:06:16,295 --> 00:06:17,102
Jennifer, by the way,

97
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:20,939
I¡¯m not gonna bring up what happened
last year when you¡¯re...you know...

98
00:06:24,577 --> 00:06:26,499
It¡¯s ridiculous, I mean, you...
something like that happens,

99
00:06:26,576 --> 00:06:29,898
and it¡¯s embarrassing and then
people just talk about it and...

100
00:06:29,981 --> 00:06:31,733
it¡¯s just, you know...

101
00:06:33,777 --> 00:06:35,449
For those of you who don¡¯t know
whst I¡¯m talking about,

102
00:06:35,497 --> 00:06:40,457
when Jennifer, last year,
she fell on the way up, tripped...

103
00:06:41,936 --> 00:06:44,427
I dont know if you got caught
on the tip of the dress.

104
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,633
Lets just show the clip,
because what happened...

105
00:06:47,294 --> 00:06:49,501
Tm kidding.
Tm not going to show the clip.

106
00:06:50,654 --> 00:06:51,985
Tm kidding. lam.

107
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,865
I¡¯m not. I¡¯m not. But let¡¯s just...

108
00:06:55,895 --> 00:06:58,341
Md you know, the thing,
when you fell out of the car tonight,

109
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,737
when youre getting out of the car,

110
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,217
no one needs to know that.
Tm not going to mention that...

111
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,664
she fell on the way out of the car.

112
00:07:07,295 --> 00:07:09,536
Like on an orange cone...
you tripped or something.

113
00:07:10,578 --> 00:07:13,274
If you win tonight, I think
we should bring you the Oscar.

114
00:07:13,303 --> 00:07:16,170
I don¡¯t wanns risk...unless somebody...

115
00:07:21,887 --> 00:07:24,014
We can do that, right?
Can we do that?

116
00:07:24,701 --> 00:07:25,531
No ones here.

117
00:07:27,702 --> 00:07:30,660
Win or lose, you look beautiful.
Oh you all look beautiful tonight.

118
00:07:30,734 --> 00:07:34,374
Sandy you look beautiful and Cate
you look...eoerybody looks beautiful.

119
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,990
I¡¯m not going to say
who looks the most beautiful,

120
00:07:36,576 --> 00:07:40,626
but it¡¯s clear, it¡¯s Jared Leto,
I mean he¡¯s the prettiest.

121
00:07:46,809 --> 00:07:48,458
Boy, is he pretty? I mean,

122
00:07:48,528 --> 00:07:51,383
he is nominated for
Best Supporting Actor,

123
00:07:51,451 --> 00:07:53,908
and Matthew McConaughey,
also pretty, by the way,

124
00:07:53,946 --> 00:07:58,383
but different, like a rugged dirty...
a dirty pretty. Like a rugged dirty pretty.

125
00:07:59,452 --> 00:08:01,534
No, good dirty, not bad dirty.

126
00:08:02,576 --> 00:08:05,864
Both nominated for Dallas Boyers Club,
a very important movie.

127
00:08:12,373 --> 00:08:16,343
It deals with the serious issue of
people who have sex at rodeos.

128
00:08:18,984 --> 00:08:19,587
Dont do it.

129
00:08:19,655 --> 00:08:21,509
It looks appealing, but...uhh...

130
00:08:24,498 --> 00:08:27,820
Speaking of sex at the rodeos,
Bruce Dern is here tonight.

131
00:08:28,497 --> 00:08:32,012
I had a repeated transition.
I had no idea.

132
00:08:34,293 --> 00:08:38,741
A little background on Bruce. His
grandfather was the governor of Utah.

133
00:08:38,857 --> 00:08:41,985
His great uncle was a
Pulitzer prize¡ªwinning poet.

134
00:08:42,023 --> 00:08:44,742
and his godmother was
Eleanor Roosevelt.

135
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:48,372
Md here you are amongst us tonight.
What went wrong?

136
00:08:52,168 --> 00:08:56,662
Jonah Hill is nominated for his amazing
performance in Wolf of Wall Street.

137
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:00,218
That...

138
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:04,858
I honestly, I have to say,
you showed us something in that film...

139
00:09:04,905 --> 00:09:07,783
that I have not seen
for a very very long time.

140
00:09:16,215 --> 00:09:17,091
Do you get it?

141
00:09:20,623 --> 00:09:23,865
Well we should get started.
Its gonna bean exciting night.

142
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,025
Mything can happen.
So many different possibilities.

143
00:09:27,093 --> 00:09:30,176
Possibility No. 1,
12 Years a Slave wins Best Picture.

144
00:09:34,935 --> 00:09:37,904
Possibility No. 2, you¡¯re all racists.

145
00:09:45,702 --> 00:09:49,502
Md now please welcome our first
white presenter, Anne Hathaway...

146
00:10:07,014 --> 00:10:07,742

Richie.

149
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:18,457
Spanning decades,

150
00:10:18,499 --> 00:10:20,194
continents and cultures,

151
00:10:20,263 --> 00:10:21,548
these unforgettable characters...

152
00:10:21,623 --> 00:10:24,660
reprexent vastly different facets
0f the human experience,

153
00:10:24,732 --> 00:10:26,711
but have one thing in common:

154
00:10:26,857 --> 00:10:30,384
The extraordinary talent of the
actors who brought them to life.

155
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:33,218
Here are the nominees for
actor in a supporting role.

In 1971, Bossier City, Louisiana,

172
00:13:44,374 --> 00:13:50,859
there was a teenage girl who was
pregnant with her second child.

She...

174
00:13:53,982 --> 00:13:56,780

a single mom.

176
00:13:59,186 --> 00:14:04,431
But somehow, she managed to make a
better life for herself and her children.

177
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:08,871
She encouraged her kids
to be creative, to work hard,

178
00:14:08,985 --> 00:14:11,988
and to do something special.

179

It must be tiring
being a nominee.

227
00:17:08,138 --> 00:17:11,790
So much you have to do, so many dinners,
so many people to talk to.

228
00:17:11,828 --> 00:17:13,625
It can really zap your adrenals.

238
00:17:51,543 --> 00:17:53,943

239
00:17:55,311 --> 00:17:56,676
Its intense, man.

240
00:17:57,578 --> 00:18:01,753
For decades, HoIIsood has relied
upon a special kind of magic...

241
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,827
to conjure movie heroes
0f all shapes and sizes.

and talking toys,

243
00:18:07,702 --> 00:18:10,466
to lying elephants
and dancing penguins.

244
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:14,706
Oftourse, this magic
I¡¯m referring to is LSD.

245
00:18:21,459 --> 00:18:22,983
I might be reading that wrong.

246
00:18:24,821 --> 00:18:26,698
Its animation. Wow.

247
00:18:28,613 --> 00:18:30,331

249
00:18:37,456 --> 00:18:39,333
Its a dynamic art form
all its own.

00:18:39,408 --> 00:18:44,209
A professional playground populated
with criminally creative minds.

251
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:45,492
Md without it,

heroes would never have existed.

Lets take a look
at our animated heroes, shall we?

254
00:20:14,124 --> 00:20:17,207
Myone else feel that was
a little light on Finding Nemo?

255
00:20:21,047 --> 00:20:23,891
Our next presenter may take home

433
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,427

444
00:30:40,984 --> 00:30:45,944
about power, greed,
and the definition of success.

445
00:30:45,983 --> 00:30:51,148

that go into making films.

00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:03,536
to be a little bit more optimistic

736
00:55:03,576 --> 00:55:05,976

about all of the things

that were happening in our lives.

01:04:07,374 --> 01:04:08,784
One of the beauties of film,

848
01:04:08,858 --> 01:04:10,780
is that it knows no boundaries.

849
01:04:10,827 --> 01:04:12,374
From three continents

850
01:04:12,468 --> 01:04:14,470

Ps diverse as they are dynamic,

856
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:26,736
these films transcend borders

857
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:27,633
and connect us

858
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:29,119

859
01:04:29,148 --> 01:04:30,661

899
01:06:27,328 --> 01:06:28,568
Ladies and gentlemen,

900
01:06:28,609 --> 01:06:31,407
please welcome, Tyler Perry.

901
01:06:39,607 --> 01:06:42,258
In our fourth nominee for best picture,

902
01:06:42,326 --> 01:06:43,930
a simple road trip shines

903
01:06:43,999 --> 01:06:46,047
an unflinching light on the angst of aging

904
01:06:46,124 --> 01:06:49,093
under the weight of unrealized dreams.

905
01:06:49,134 --> 01:06:51,455
Spare, sensitive, and svulful,

906
01:06:51,493 --> 01:06:52,642
Nebraska.

907
01:06:52,688 --> 01:06:53,894
Depicts a journey

908
01:06:53,930 --> 01:06:55,921
from confusion and conflict

909
01:06:55,967 --> 01:06:58,253
to compassion and connection,

910
01:06:58,374 --> 01:06:59,568
proving that nothing in the end

911
01:06:59,638 --> 01:07:00,821
is really black nor white,

912
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:03,455
but rather radiant shades of gray.

913
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,255
The near future beckons in

914
01:07:05,289 --> 01:07:07,007
a gorgeously original love story

915
01:07:07,045 --> 01:07:10,048
between a human and an operating system

916
01:07:10,092 --> 01:07:11,491
in our fifth nominee,

917
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:14,533
simultaneously intimate and universal,

918
01:07:14,570 --> 01:07:16,640
unsettling and engaging,

919
01:07:16,811 --> 01:07:18,381
the film is an evocative

920
01:07:18,414 --> 01:07:21,383
evploration of love, loss sod healing,

921
01:07:21,414 --> 01:07:23,279
and high¡ªwaisted pants.

922
01:07:23,327 --> 01:07:25,966
It¡¯s funny and fresh,

923
01:07:26,006 --> 01:07:27,610
and strange and soothing,

924
01:07:27,647 --> 01:07:30,024
and poignant and provocative.

925
01:07:30,092 --> 01:07:31,411
It is Her.

926
01:07:31,968 --> 01:07:34,050
Sudden disaster propels our

927
01:07:34,093 --> 01:07:35,890
sioth nominee for best picture

928
01:07:35,931 --> 01:07:37,569
on an adrenaline¡ªdrenched ride

929
01:07:37,609 --> 01:07:39,406
into the deepest reaches

930
01:07:39,453 --> 01:07:40,818
of space and consciousness.

931
01:07:40,851 --> 01:07:42,375
Boomeranging between

932
01:07:42,414 --> 01:07:45,281
explosive action and haunting stillness,

933
01:07:45,326 --> 01:07:46,327
Gravity,

934
01:07:46,405 --> 01:07:49,249
probes elemental questions of courage,

935
01:07:49,288 --> 01:07:50,732
fear, and survival,

936
01:07:50,772 --> 01:07:52,285
leaving us breathless

937
01:07:52,326 --> 01:07:54,567
and leaving us inspired.

938
01:09:37,015 --> 01:09:38,687
I put different clothes on.

939
01:09:38,764 --> 01:09:39,571
That¡¯s right.

940
01:09:41,296 --> 01:09:42,536
I¡¯m almost embarrassed

941
01:09:42,570 --> 01:09:43,457
to introduce this man

942
01:09:43,491 --> 01:09:45,049
because he needs no introduction

943
01:09:45,091 --> 01:09:47,013
and yet, if I don¡¯t introduce him,

944
01:09:47,053 --> 01:09:48,611
he would never know when to come out.

945
01:09:48,654 --> 01:09:50,815
So here¡¯s a man, like I said,

946
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:52,181
needs no introduction,

947
01:09:52,210 --> 01:09:54,656
please welcome, Brad Pitt.

948
01:10:05,092 --> 01:10:06,377
Our next performers are the

949
01:10:06,414 --> 01:10:07,608
biggest rock bend in the world.

950
01:10:07,654 --> 01:10:08,848
So its only fitting

951
01:10:08,887 --> 01:10:10,661
that theyve used their considerable gifts

952
01:10:10,694 --> 01:10:12,013
to pay tribute to one of the most

953
01:10:12,053 --> 01:10:12,894
profoundly good

954
01:10:12,934 --> 01:10:15,095
and courageous heroes 0f our time.

955
01:10:15,132 --> 01:10:17,851
Here to perform their song, Ordinary Love,

956
01:10:17,937 --> 01:10:18,813
from the tim

957

please welcome, U2.

959
01:10:35,373 --> 01:10:37,170
The sea wants to kiss

960
01:10:37,210 --> 01:10:39,212
The golden shore

961
01:10:39,249 --> 01:10:42,298
The sunlight warms your skin

962
01:10:43,125 --> 01:10:44,490
PJI the beauty

963
01:10:44,531 --> 01:10:47,250
That¡¯s been lost before

964
01:10:47,328 --> 01:10:50,411
Wants to fnd us again

965
01:10:51,296 --> 01:10:54,379
I cant fight you anymore

966
01:10:55,326 --> 01:10:58,329
Its you I¡¯m fighting for

967
01:10:59,374 --> 01:11:02,377
The sea throws rocks together

968
01:11:02,415 --> 01:11:07,409
But time leaves us polished stones

969
01:11:07,453 --> 01:11:10,536
We cant fall any further

970
01:11:10,571 --> 01:11:15,179
If we can¡¯t feel ordinary love

971
01:11:15,211 --> 01:11:18,453
We cannot reach any higher

972
01:11:18,491 --> 01:11:24,134
If we can¡¯t deal with ordinary love

973
01:11:30,734 --> 01:11:34,659
Birds fly high in the summer sky

974
01:11:34,696 --> 01:11:38,382
Md rest on the breeze

975
01:11:38,607 --> 01:11:40,973
The same wind will take care

976
01:11:41,013 --> 01:11:42,617
of you and I

977
01:11:42,685 --> 01:11:46,576
Well build our house in the trees

978
01:11:46,615 --> 01:11:49,812
Your heed is on my sleeve

979
01:11:49,852 --> 01:11:54,414
Did you put it there with a magic marker?

980
01:11:54,485 --> 01:11:57,613
For years I would believe

981
01:11:57,688 --> 01:12:02,375
That the world couldnt wash us away

982
01:12:02,452 --> 01:12:05,455
We cant fall any further

983
01:12:05,491 --> 01:12:10,099
if we cant feel ordinary love

984
01:12:10,131 --> 01:12:13,305
We cannot reach any higher

985
01:12:13,336 --> 01:12:19,582
If we can¡¯t deal with ordinary love

986
01:12:20,218 --> 01:12:23,483
Ordinary love

987
01:12:23,733 --> 01:12:27,533
Ordinary love

988
01:12:32,888 --> 01:12:35,812
We cant fall any further

989
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:40,413
if we cant feel ordinary love

990
01:12:40,453 --> 01:12:43,775
We cannot reach any higher

991
01:12:43,843 --> 01:12:48,940
If we can¡¯t deal with ordinary love

992
01:12:50,013 --> 01:12:51,685
Ordinary love

993
01:12:51,732 --> 01:12:55,577
We cant feel ordinary love

994
01:12:55,616 --> 01:12:58,665
We cannot reach any higher

995
01:12:58,695 --> 01:13:02,768
If we can¡¯t deal with ordinary love

996
01:13:02,844 --> 01:13:05,586
We can¡¯t fall any further

997
01:13:05,619 --> 01:13:09,976
if we cant feel ordinary love

998
01:13:10,014 --> 01:13:13,484
We cannot reach any higher

999
01:13:13,576 --> 01:13:19,219
If we can¡¯t deal with ordinary love

1000
01:13:19,326 --> 01:13:21,021
Darling love

1001
01:14:05,778 --> 01:14:07,530
Dont be scared of me.

1002
01:14:08,247 --> 01:14:09,862

01:14:37,258 --> 01:14:39,613
Meryl, here¡¯s my idea, okay?

1019
01:14:39,656 --> 01:14:43,046
So you were nominated the
record¡ªbreaking 18 times, right?

1020
01:14:43,092 --> 01:14:45,788
So I thought we would try to break
another record right now,

1021
01:14:45,819 --> 01:14:48,743
with the most Retweets of a photo.

1022
01:14:48,856 --> 01:14:49,299
Okay.

1023
01:14:49,334 --> 01:14:51,973
So right now,
I¡¯m gonna take a pictore of on.

1024
01:14:52,012 --> 01:14:52,455
Okay.

1025
01:14:52,497 --> 01:14:53,247
Md then well see

1026
01:14:53,293 --> 01:14:54,043

1027
01:14:54,089 --> 01:14:55,420
¡ª for the most Retweets.

Move it this way. This way.

1041
01:15:17,538 --> 01:15:19,142
If we wanted to be re¡ªtweeted this

1042
01:15:19,178 --> 01:15:19,815
Meryl?

¡ª Meryl.

01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:23,101

1045
01:15:23,171 --> 01:15:24,661
Can you take it, Meryl?

1046
01:15:24,936 --> 01:15:27,177
Meryl, can you take it?
I can¡¯t get everybody in here.

1047
01:15:27,218 --> 01:15:28,458
il right, I got it for you.

01:15:28,499 --> 01:15:30,069

¡ª We did it.
¡ª Thank you.

1055
01:15:42,294 --> 01:15:44,535
Oh, I¡¯ve never tweeted before.

1056
01:15:44,576 --> 01:15:45,577
We tweeted!.

1057
01:15:45,655 --> 01:15:47,384
This is the most re¡ªtweeted in history.

1058
01:15:47,422 --> 01:15:50,744
¡ª Chiwetel! Were you in here?

Oh, did you get in on that too?
God, you¡¯re a photo hog.

1063
01:15:59,693 --> 01:16:02,218
Please welcome,

1064

1065
01:16:03,137 --> 01:16:05,537
and the star of Frozen, Kristen Bell.

1066
01:16:15,966 --> 01:16:18,617
The movies that speak directly to our hearts

1067
01:16:18,655 --> 01:16:21,146
are diligently crafted by impressive minds.

1068
01:16:21,178 --> 01:16:22,975
Each year since 1931,

1069
01:16:23,012 --> 01:16:24,968
the Academy has honoured the scientists,

1070
01:16:25,011 --> 01:16:28,014
innovators and engineers
whose pioneering work

1071
01:16:28,059 --> 01:16:29,936
has made a difference in the world of film.

1072
01:16:29,974 --> 01:16:32,898
The tradition of celebrating
these extraordinary people

1073
01:16:32,936 --> 01:16:34,892
continued on February 15th

1074
01:16:34,936 --> 01:16:38,099
at the Academys Annual Scientific
and Technical Awards.

1075
01:16:38,139 --> 01:16:40,710
Here are some of the highlights

1076
01:16:40,811 --> 01:16:42,972
which Michael and I
were privileged enough to host.

1077
01:16:45,856 --> 01:16:48,529
The class of 2013 was a large one,

1078
01:16:48,575 --> 01:16:52,090
with 21 awards going to 54 honorees.

1079
01:16:52,137 --> 01:16:53,297
On the mechanical side,

1080
01:16:53,341 --> 01:16:55,297
the Achievements included two miniature

1081
01:16:55,335 --> 01:16:56,859
helicopter camera platforms,

1082
01:16:56,935 --> 01:17:00,063
and a safe, air¡ªpowered way
to lip cam over.

1083
01:17:00,421 --> 01:17:02,252
On the software side,

1084
01:17:02,342 --> 01:17:04,788
the honours went to companies
and individuals

1085
01:17:05,013 --> 01:17:07,425
whose computer programms
have revolutionized

1086
01:17:07,498 --> 01:17:09,944
virtually every phase of filmmaking.

1087
01:17:10,059 --> 01:17:13,779
Charles ¡®Tad¡± Marburg received
the John A. Banner Medal of Commendation.

1088
01:17:13,818 --> 01:17:17,618
Md Peter Anderson was given
the Gordon E. Sawer Award,

1089
01:17:17,655 --> 01:17:19,862
an Oscar, for his many achievements

1090
01:17:19,936 --> 01:17:22,860
in two¡ªdimensional
and three¡ªdimensional llmmaking.

1091
01:17:22,937 --> 01:17:24,609
A special Academy Award of Merit

1092
01:17:24,656 --> 01:17:26,817
was bestowed on all the men and women

1093
01:17:26,858 --> 01:17:30,021
who have worked in film laboratories
since movies were invented.

1094
01:17:30,091 --> 01:17:33,060
Director Christopher Nolan
accepted on their behalf.

1095
01:17:33,372 --> 01:17:38,139
This awsrd is in recognition of a very
special form of alchemy,

1096
01:17:38,177 --> 01:17:41,658
that is turning silver and plastic
into dreams.

1097
01:17:52,936 --> 01:17:54,176
Our next presenters

1098
01:17:54,217 --> 01:17:56,788
probably think theyre so greet
because they are.

1099
01:17:56,819 --> 01:18:00,539
Please welcome Chris Hemsworth
and Oscar winner Charlize Theron.

1100
01:18:10,297 --> 01:18:13,255
Movies are a fully sensory esperience,

1101
01:18:13,297 --> 01:18:15,504
heard and felt, as well as seen.

1102
01:18:15,577 --> 01:18:19,661
But without the handiwork of
sound mixers and sound editors,

1103
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:21,144
theyd be lost.

1104
01:18:21,177 --> 01:18:22,940
Just by imagining Star Wars

1105
01:18:22,981 --> 01:18:25,176
without the hum and swoosh
of the lightsabers.

1106
01:18:25,216 --> 01:18:27,582
Or Jurassic Park
without the roar of the T¡ªrex.

1107
01:18:27,616 --> 01:18:28,992
Well, luckily,

1108
01:18:29,022 --> 01:18:29,738
we don¡¯t have to,

1109
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:31,896
thanks to the gifted men and women

1110
01:18:31,936 --> 01:18:35,531
who bring the movies to life
through the magic of sound.

1111
01:18:37,608 --> 01:18:38,586
Is that me?

1112
01:18:38,655 --> 01:18:39,656
I think so.

1113
01:18:39,702 --> 01:18:43,297
Oh, and here are the nominees

The Oscar goes to...

1126
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:30,429

I¡¯d like to thank my lovely wife,

1451
01:40:09,532 --> 01:40:11,375
When I was a kid,

1452
01:40:11,530 --> 01:40:13,407
there were a couple of things that I knew.

1453
01:40:13,448 --> 01:40:14,813
Christmas was coming.

1454
01:40:14,886 --> 01:40:17,684
But I knew before that was coming,
Thanksgiving was coming,

1455
01:40:17,730 --> 01:40:20,767
which meant The Wizard 0f Oz was coming.

1456
01:40:20,961 --> 01:40:24,044
You see, back in the olden days,

1457
01:40:24,089 --> 01:40:26,410
you only got to see it once a year.

1458
01:40:26,526 --> 01:40:30,917
So ittorns oot, yoo see, not all heroes
wear capes and masks.

1459
01:40:31,012 --> 01:40:32,843
Sometimes they wear...

1460
01:40:34,835 --> 01:40:36,086
ruby slippers.

1461
01:40:42,914 --> 01:40:44,734
Now in 1939,

1462
01:40:44,806 --> 01:40:47,479
moviegoers first fell in love
with s girl named Dorothy

1463
01:40:47,524 --> 01:40:50,118
who longed for a life
different from her own.

1464
01:40:50,195 --> 01:40:56,043
Md in one of the most beloved cinematic,
magic joorneys of all time,

1465
01:40:56,118 --> 01:40:58,484
and with the help
of some very memorable friends,

1466
01:40:58,554 --> 01:41:00,658
a tin man, a lion and a scarecrow,

1467
01:41:00,758 --> 01:41:02,919
Dorothy got her wish.

1468
01:41:03,037 --> 01:41:05,323
Now that year,
the incredible Judy Garland,

1469
01:41:05,397 --> 01:41:07,126
one of my personal heroes,

1470
01:41:07,194 --> 01:41:09,651
received an honorary Juvenile Oscar

1471
01:41:09,689 --> 01:41:13,011
after following the Yellow Brick Road
right into nor hearts.

1472
01:41:13,049 --> 01:41:17,736
Md tonight, here to commemorate
the legacy of The Wizard of Oz

1473
01:41:17,805 --> 01:41:20,808
and of Judy, are Judys kids.

1474
01:41:20,882 --> 01:41:24,272
Oscar winner Liza Minnelli,
the fabulous Lorna Luft

1475
01:41:24,365 --> 01:41:26,196
and the amazing Joey Luft.

1476
01:41:26,272 --> 01:41:29,651
Kids, stand up and take a bow.

1477
01:41:44,914 --> 01:41:49,965
So to celebrate the 75th anniversary
0f this magical film,

1478
01:41:50,038 --> 01:41:51,448
please welcome the gorgeous

Oh, I¡¯m terribly sorry.

1481
01:41:55,242 --> 01:41:57,016
That¡¯s what I call her
when we¡¯re at the house,

1482
01:41:57,086 --> 01:41:57,962
you know, hanging out.

1483
01:41:58,086 --> 01:42:02,011
Buti know the rest of you
probably know her as Pink.

1484
01:42:14,162 --> 01:42:17,450
When all the world is a hopeless jumble

1485
01:42:17,553 --> 01:42:21,455
Md the raindrops tumble all around

1486
01:42:22,727 --> 01:42:29,200
Heaven opens a magic lane

1487
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:35,657
When all the clouds darken up the skvay

1488
01:42:35,726 --> 01:42:39,844
There¡¯s a rainbow highway to be found

1489
01:42:41,085 --> 01:42:47,888
Leading from your window pane

1490
01:42:48,477 --> 01:42:52,243
To a place behind the sun

1491
01:42:53,163 --> 01:43:00,012
Just a step beyond the rein

1492
01:43:04,397 --> 01:43:12,759
Somewhere over the rainbow

1493
01:43:14,196 --> 01:43:18,690
Way up high

1494
01:43:21,678 --> 01:43:28,322
There¡¯s a land that I heard of

1495
01:43:28,397 --> 01:43:34,529
Once in a lullaby

1496
01:43:36,446 --> 01:43:43,454
Somewhere over the rainbow

1497
01:43:43,601 --> 01:43:48,117
Skies are blue

1498
01:43:49,037 --> 01:43:56,170
Md the dreams that you dare to dream

1499
01:43:56,243 --> 01:44:00,327
Really do come true

1500
01:44:10,194 --> 01:44:12,890
Someday I¡¯ll wish upon a star

1501
01:44:12,928 --> 01:44:20,687
Md wake up where the clouds
are far behind me

1502
01:44:21,570 --> 01:44:24,448
Where troubles melt
like lemon drops

1503
01:44:24,524 --> 01:44:27,015
Up way above the chimney tops

1504
01:44:27,087 --> 01:44:32,935
That¡¯s where you¡¯ll find me

1505
01:44:35,163 --> 01:44:40,806
Somewhere over the rainbow

1506
01:44:41,759 --> 01:44:45,934
Bluebirds fly

1507
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:53,297
Birds fly over the rainbow

1508
01:44:53,366 --> 01:44:59,214
Why, then, oh, why can¡¯t I?

1509
01:45:02,930 --> 01:45:07,048
If happy little bluebirds fly

1510
01:45:07,727 --> 01:45:11,766
Beyond the rainbow

1511
01:45:12,086 --> 01:45:25,250
Why, oh, why cant 1?

1512
01:46:13,055 --> 01:46:13,851
Did I miss it?

1513
01:46:15,008 --> 01:46:15,940
Is it over?

1514
01:46:21,052 --> 01:46:23,725
Not cool, guys. They were gonna call me.

1515
01:46:29,162 --> 01:46:30,368
III do it by myself.

1516

It must have been cold there
In my shadow

1593
01:57:39,315 --> 01:57:45,038
To never have sunlight
On your face

1594
01:57:46,567 --> 01:57:51,402
You were content to let me shine

1595
01:57:51,444 --> 01:57:53,890
That¡¯s your way

1596
01:57:54,240 --> 01:58:00,292
You always walked a step behind

1597
01:58:00,847 --> 01:58:07,082
So I was the one
With all the glory

1598
01:58:07,207 --> 01:58:14,522
While you, you were the one
With all the strength

A beautiful face without a name
For so loot

A beautiful smile
To hide the pain

1601
01:58:30,488 --> 01:58:37,883
Did you ever know
That youre my hero?

1602

Than an eagle

1604
01:58:52,127 --> 01:58:59,807
Because you, you are the wind
Beneath my wings

1605
01:59:04,444 --> 01:59:10,371
It might have appeared
To go unnoticed

1606
01:59:10,410 --> 01:59:17,600
But I¡¯ve got it, I¡¯ve got it
nj1 here in my heart

Md perhaps those of us in the industry

2057
02:34:07,957 --> 02:34:10,699
who are still foolishly clinging to the idea

2058
02:34:10,770 --> 02:34:14,524
that female films with women at the centre

2059
02:34:14,645 --> 02:34:16,647
are niche experiences.

2060
02:34:16,693 --> 02:34:17,853
They are not.

2061
02:34:17,928 --> 02:34:22,251
Audiences went to see them
and in fact, they earn money, so¡ª¡ª

2062
02:34:24,600 --> 02:34:28,138

to respect others.

2151

That¡¯s who I chase.

2160
02:41:45,710 --> 02:41:47,166
Now when I was 15 years old,

2161
02:41:47,273 --> 02:41:48,968
I had a very important person
in my life come to me and say,

2162
02:41:49,001 --> 02:41:50,275
whoa your hero
and I said I dont know

2163
02:41:50,352 --> 02:41:51,717
Igot to think about that
give me a couple weeks.

2164
02:41:51,757 --> 02:41:52,792
I come back two weeks later

2165
02:41:52,835 --> 02:41:54,325
this person comes says
Whos your hero?

2166
02:41:54,429 --> 02:41:55,407
I said, I thought about it.

2167
02:41:55,475 --> 02:41:57,921
Md you know who it is I said,
it¡¯s me in 10 years.

2168
02:41:58,880 --> 02:42:01,041
So I turned 25, 10 years later.

2169
02:42:01,163 --> 02:42:02,403
That same person comes up to me

2170
02:42:02,438 --> 02:42:03,564
Md goes ¡®So are you a hero?¡±

2171
02:42:03,633 --> 02:42:05,715
Mdl was like, ¡®not even close.¡±

2172
02:42:05,836 --> 02:42:10,045
No, no, no. She said, why? I said,
because my hero¡¯s me at 35.

2173
02:42:10,079 --> 02:42:13,196
So, every day, every week, every month
and every year of my life,

2174
02:42:14,429 --> 02:42:15,680
My hero¡¯s always 10 years away.

2175
02:42:15,718 --> 02:42:17,481
Tm never gonna be my hero.

2176
02:42:17,600 --> 02:42:19,636
Tm not gonna attain that.
I know Tm not.

2177
02:42:19,677 --> 02:42:20,530
Md thats just fine with me

2178
02:42:20,599 --> 02:42:23,841
because that keeps me with
somebody to keep on chasing.

2179
02:42:24,476 --> 02:42:27,274
So, to any of us,
whatever those things are,

2180
02:42:27,320 --> 02:42:28,400
whatever it is we look up to,

2181
02:42:28,960 --> 02:42:30,439
whatever it is we look forward to

2182
02:42:30,523 --> 02:42:32,047
and whoever it is were chasing,

2183
02:42:32,080 --> 02:42:33,206
to that, I say amen.

2184
02:42:33,321 --> 02:42:35,846
To that, I say, all right,
all right, all right.

2185
02:42:37,429 --> 02:42:40,603
In that I say, just keep living, huh?
Thank you.

2186
02:42:55,320 --> 02:42:56,719
mu right. It is time.
