1
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,840
片名：享受吧! 一個人的旅行

2
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,959
我有個朋友叫黛博拉
她是個心理學家
l have a friend, Deborah,
a psychologist...

3
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:45,294
費城政府要求她.
...who was asked
by the city of Philadelphia...

4
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:49,549
為剛剛來到這裏的柬埔寨難民
...if she could offer psychological
counseling to Cambodian refugees...

5
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:53,261
和海上難民提供心理咨詢
...boat people,
who had recently arrived in the city.

6
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:56,556
黛博拉被嚇壞了
因為這些柬埔寨人
Deborah was daunted by the task.
These Cambodians...

7
00:00:56,724 --> 00:01:01,728
經歷了種族屠殺和大饑荒
眼睜睜看著親人被殺害
...had suffered genocide, starvation,
relatives murdered before their eyes...

8
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:05,648
在難民營待過多年
悲慘地坐船逃到西方世界
...years in refugee camps,
harrowing boat trips to the West.

9
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:07,984
她怎麼能理解他們的感受?
How could she relate
to their suffering?

10
00:01:08,152 --> 00:01:09,819
她怎麼能幫到這些人呢?
How could she help these people?

11
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,703
大家猜猜  這些難民和黛博拉
So guess what all these people
wanted to talk about...

12
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:21,622
我這位心理學家朋友  談得最多的是什麼...
...with my friend Deborah,
the psychologist.

13
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:26,544
幾乎都是"我是在難民營遇見他的
lt was all,
"l met this guy in the refugee camp.

14
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:29,547
我覺得他真的很愛我 但分開了以後
I thought he really loved me,
but when we got separated...

15
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:32,300
他和我表妹好上了
現在他還說他愛我
...he took up with my cousin.
Now he says he loves me...

16
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:35,928
還老是打電話給我 他們已經結婚了
我該怎麼辦?"
...and keeps calling me. They're
married now. What should l do?"

17
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,180
因為大家都這樣
This is how we are.

18
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,556
有什麼我能幫您的嗎?
May I help you?

19
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:41,392
我是麗茲.吉爾伯特 我在寫一篇有關
巴里島的文章
I'm Liz Gilbert. I'm writing
a magazine article on Bali.

20
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,019
我想來見見一位巫醫
I wanted to meet a medicine man.

21
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:46,272
大家都跟我說我該見見科圖.賴爺 我來對地方了嗎?
Everyone said I should meet
Ketut Liyer. Am l in the right place?

22
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,523
等一下
Wait.

23
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:52,028
你瞧 現在我來到了這
見一個第九代傳人的巫醫
l mean, here I am with
a ninth-generation medicine man...

24
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:54,697
我該問他些什麼問題呢?
...and what do I wanna
ask him about?

25
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:57,200
如何走近上帝?
Getting closer to God?

26
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,912
怎麼拯救全世界挨餓的兒童?
Saving the world's
starving children?

27
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,207
很高興見到你 我是科圖.賴爺
Happy to see you. l am Ketut Liyer.

28
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:09,295
才不 我要和他說說我的戀愛史
Nope. l wanna discuss
my relationship.

29
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:15,134
你在全世界旅行
You are a world traveler.

30
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,386
你會活很長一段時間
You will live a long time...

31
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,890
交到很多朋友 擁有許多人生體驗
...have many friends,
many experiences.

32
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:26,145
你會結兩次婚 一次很長 一次很短
You will have two marriages.
One long, one short.

33
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,272
我現在的是長的還是短的?
Am l in the long one
or the short one?

34
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,358
天機不可泄露
Can't tell.

35
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:34,487
你還會變成窮光蛋
Also you will lose all your money.

36
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,825
就在未來六到十個月內
I think in next six to 1 0 months.

37
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:43,204
不過別擔心 你會掙回來的
Don't worry.
You will get it all back again.

38
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,290
而且你還會回到巴里島
And you will come back to Bali...

39
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:52,755
住大概三四個月 教我英語
...and live here for three or four
months and teach me English.

40
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:56,384
我一直找不到人和我練英語
I never had anybody
to practice my English with.

41
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,719
然後...
And then...

42
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:04,267
我會把我懂的都教給你
...l will teach you everything l know.

43
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:08,938
等等
Wait.

44
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,069
這個給你
I have this for you.

45
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:18,698
要腳踏實地
你就會感覺有四條腿
Keep grounded so it's like
you have four legs.

46
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,367
這樣你就能好好停留在這個世界
That way, you can stay in this world.

47
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:25,913
還有 不要用你的頭腦看這個世界
Also, no looking at world
through your head.

48
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,499
用你的心看
Look through your heart instead.

49
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,793
這樣你才能瞭解上帝
That way, you will know God.

50
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:34,463
這就是你來這裏的原因吧?
Which is why you came here, no?

51
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:39,051
後會有期了  小鱷魚(俏皮話)
See you later, alligator.

52
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,050
六個月後

53
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:56,819
我校對了她所有的手稿
I proofread all of her manuscripts.

54
00:03:56,987 --> 00:04:00,489
我老婆非常非常漂亮
不過她拼不來單詞
My wife is very, very beautiful,
but she can't spell for anything.

55
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,326
看 是史蒂芬叔叔
Look at Uncle Stephen.

56
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:05,995
還有麗茲阿姨
And Auntie Liz.

57
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:09,874
我正掐表計算這聚會什麼時候結束
我就能回去穿上大號褲子了
I'm counting the minutes for this to be
over so l can get in my big girl pants.

58
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,001
你看起來太棒了 你才剛生完孩子
You look fantastic.
You just had a baby.

59
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,170
哦 你騙我 我肥死了 還累得要死
Oh, you're lying.
I'm fat, I'm exhausted...

60
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:16,881
腦子裏就不能有兩個想法並存
我覺得自己就像麗莎明妮莉
...l can't keep two thoughts.
I feel like Liza Minnelli.

61
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,716
史蒂芬 你能抱著傑克嗎?
Stephen, can you hold Jack?

62

Hey, dude, you wanna grab a beer

我餵了他玉米脆餅 沒關係吧?
I fed him nachos. ls that bad?

70

81
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:15,356
哦 沒有 這樣多好玩啊
Oh, no. This is so much fun.

82
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,526
你還記得自己是什麼時候想生孩子的?
Did you know the exact moment
you wanted to have a baby?

83
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:23,197
不記得了 但是在我結婚之前
就拿到那盒子了
I can't remember, but l've had the box

I will laugh at you,
but you still have to tell me.

87
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,000
好吧

88
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,168
床底下
Under the bed.

89
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:45,261
我一直把各種小寶寶的東西放進去

90
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:48,264
等待著安迪想做父親的那一天
...waiting until Andy

91
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,227

All the places l wanna see

96
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:14,874
麗茲 生個孩子就像在臉上紋身
Liz, having a baby is like
getting a tattoo on your face.

97
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,461
你差不多要全身心投入
You kind of wanna be
fully committed.

98
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:25,801
所以我下個禮拜去阿魯巴島
只是一些很基礎的安排
So my trip to Aruba next week,
which is just a basic, you know...

99
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:28,596
睡哪啦 去游泳啦 品嘗美食...
..."where to sleep, swim
and stuff your face" piece....

100
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:30,222
我還買了件新的比基尼
I got a new bikini.

101
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,893
然後我就發現自己可以
無限制使用客房冰箱
And it turns out,
I have unlimited minibar access.

102
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,895
- 你懂什麼意思吧?
- 時差反應?
-You know what that means?
-Jet lag?

103
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,773
你 和我
You, me...

104

...盡情享用夏威夷果實

105
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,943
不錯啊
That was cute.

106
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:46,322
你知道我剛在聚會上聊天的那個人
讓我挺佩服的...
You know who l was talking to
at the party who was really inspiring...

107
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,865
- 布萊恩  - 塔拉的朋友
- Brian
-...was Tara's friend.

108
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:51,202
就是布萊恩 太不可思議了
他是個老師 你知道嗎?
Brian. Unbelievable.
He's a teacher, you know that?

109
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,120
是代課老師吧?
He's a substitute teacher, isn't he?

110
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:56,332
對 他跟我聊起現在教育費用的預算縮減
Yeah. He was talking about the
budget cuts that are happening now.

111
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,250
學校幾乎一分錢也沒有了
There's no money for anything.

112
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,087
音樂課取消了 藝術課取消了
There's no music classes,
there's no arts classes.

113
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,215
現在他們只能在課後義務教這些課
They're volunteering their time
to do all of this after school.

114
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,425
就是他們這些人在教我們的孩子
你知道嗎?
They're educating our kids,
you know?

115
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,470
你會是個好老師的 親愛的
I think you'd make
a great teacher, honey.

116
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:12,848
謝謝 不過其實我在想
Thank you,
but I was thinking more of like...

117
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,769
回學校繼續學習 拿到碩士學位
...education. Getting my masters,
going back to school. l don't know.

118
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,604
你覺得呢?
You know?

119
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,488
我...

- 回到學校哦
- 我就是想到什麼說什麼
-Going back to school.
-l'm just thinking out loud.

121
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:38,290
我有個不祥的預感
覺得科圖的預言正在成真
I was getting the sinking feeling that
Ketut's prophecy was coming true.

122
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,127
現在是不是我那段短暫的婚姻?
Was l in the shorter marriage?

123
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,881
我們一年前才買了這棟房子
We'd only bought this house
a year ago.

124
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,967
這不是我想要的生活嗎?
Hadn't I wanted this?

125
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:54,723
我積極熱切地參與到這段生活的
I had actively participated
in every moment of the creation...

126
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,725
...無時無刻都積極
...of this life.

127
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:00,229
那為什麼我還覺得不是生活在其中?
So why didn't I see myself
in any of it?

128
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:09,572
唯一比留下來更不可思議的事情是...
The only thing more impossible
than staying...

129
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,615
...離開
...was leaving.

130
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:17,413
我不想傷害任何人
只想從後門悄悄溜走
I didn't wanna hurt anybody. l wanted
to slip quietly out the back door...

131
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:21,083
不停地奔向格陵蘭
...and not stop running
until l reached Greenland.

132
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:28,090
不過 我做了個相反的決定
lnstead, l made a decision.

133
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,426
祈禱
To pray.

134
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:34,096
其實就是 和上帝對話
You know, like, to God.

135
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:39,351
對我來說這事太過怪異
一開始我居然是這麼說的
And it was such a foreign concept to
me, that l swear l almost began with:

136
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,520
我很崇拜您的工作
"l'm a big fan of your work."

137
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,821
你好 上帝?
Hello, God?

138
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,785
很高興認識你 我...
Nice to finally meet you. l....

139
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:03,959
很抱歉以前從來沒直接跟你說過話...
I am sorry l've never spoken
directly to you before...

140
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,794
但是...
...but...

141
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,465
我希望我已經向你表示過...
...l hope l've expressed my...

142
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:14,178
對於你在我的生活中...
...ample gratitude for all
the blessings you've given...

143
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,639
所給予的幸福的感激...
...to me in my life.

144
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,984
我現在有大麻煩了
I'm in serious trouble.

145
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,322
我不知道該怎麼辦
I don't know what to do.

146
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:37,159
我需要答案
I need an answer.

147
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:41,872
請求你告訴我該怎麼做
Please, tell me what to do.

148
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,335
哦 上帝 幫幫我 拜託
Oh, God, help me, please.

149
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,469
告訴我該怎麼辦 我會照辦的
Tell me what to do and l'll do it.

150
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:01,016
回床上睡覺 麗茲
Go back to bed, Liz.

151
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,373
我不想去阿魯巴島
I don't wanna go to Aruba.

152
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:30,629
我不想要婚姻
I don't wanna be married.

153
00:10:40,562 --> 00:10:41,559
《誰動了我的奶酪》

154
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:43,112
《不幸到幸福》

155
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:50,733
樓下有一整櫃有關離婚的書
You know, there's a whole
divorce section downstairs.

156
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,086
- ''胡椒研磨機''
- 她現在正處於
-"Pepper grinder."
-She's having...

157
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,464
- 精神崩潰之中
- 女人就是這樣的
-...a nervous breakdown.
-This is what girls do.

158
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,133
- 她在自我處理
- 她幹嘛不去喝個爛醉或找人上床?
-She's processing.
-Why doesn't she get drunk or laid?

159
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,302
如果你離開我我就會這麼干
That's what l would do if you left me.

160
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,845
不 你不會的
No, you wouldn't.

161
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,723
- 嗯 我不會的
- 她搬了出來 和法庭申請離婚
-No, I wouldn't.
-She moved out, she filed for divorce.

162
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:26,185
他們在一起八年了 她沒其他地方去
They were together eight years.
She's got no home.

163
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:35,194
''遺產''
"Legacy."

164
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:42,618
每個意大利單詞就像一塊巧克力糖
一個魔術
Every word in Italian is like a truffle.
A magic trick.

165
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,163
親愛的我懂 現在它是你的救生筏
Honey, l get it.
It's your life raft right now.

166
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:49,583
我和安迪離婚兩個星期後
我買了架織布機
When Andy and l broke up
for two weeks, l bought a loom.

167
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:52,586
我居然買了架要命的織布機
他居然要搞微釀啤酒
A frigging loom.
And he tried to start a microbrewery.

168
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:55,714
我不知道你們現在有多討厭我
反正我自己都討厭自己
I don't know how you guys
aren't sick of me now. I'm sick of me.

169
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,133
說什麼呢? 我們喜歡和你在一起
Are you kidding me?
We love having you.

170
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,427
就像我們有個駐家作家一樣
It's kind of like having
a writer in residence.

171
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:03,097
可你是個作家 你應該寫點什麼
But you are a writer.
You should be writing something.

172
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:07,434
也許我可以寫寫一個去意大利
學意大利語的女人
Maybe I could write about a woman
who goes to Italy to learn ltalian.

173
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:11,063
書名就叫《碳水化合物和變位動詞》
Call it
Carbohydrates and Conjugations.

174
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,774
我要自己找個地方住了
I'll start looking for a place.

175
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:18,237
- 我愛上你了
- 我不是你以為的那個人
-l'm falling in love with you.
-l'm not who you think I am.

176
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:19,905
我只是你的幻想
I'm just your fantasy.

177
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:24,284
不 瞎說 你是真實的
No, that's bullshit. You're real.

178
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,454
你的傷痕 你的才華
Your scars, your talent.

179
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,706
事實上 我不過只有一個爛酒吧...
The fact that
I own a piece-of-crap bar...

180
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,126
你卻能接受我只有這點能耐
...and you accept that
that's all l'm gonna do.

181
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,669
得了 這太爛了
Okay, this sucks.

182
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:36,338
- 我同意
- 別這麼無情
-l second that.
-Don't be rude.

183
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,556
我愛你的痛楚
I love your pain.

184
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:50,269
當我們在一起的時候
我很高興能抹去你的痛楚
And l love that when we're together,
I can make it go away.

185
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:52,855
- 哦 他演得不錯
- 你的愛...
-Oh, he's good.
-You're love...

186
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:56,692
- 他是很帥 但不代表他演技好
- ...就像熱麵包
-He's hot, there's a difference.
-...is like a hot panini.

187
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,989
當我看著你的眼睛
我能聽到海豚在擊掌輕拍
And when I look into your eyes,
I hear dolphins clapping.

188
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:04,658
那句話不是我寫的
I did not write that line.

189
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,326
他所不知道的是
Here's what he doesn't know yet.

190
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:11,290
我消失在了我愛的人之中
I disappear into the person l love.

191
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:16,378
我就是一層滲透膜 如果我愛你
你就能得到所有
I am the permeable membrane.
If l love you, you can have it all.

192
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:19,381
我的金錢 我的時間 我的身體
My money, my time, my body...

193
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:23,051
我的狗 我狗的金錢
...my dog, my dog's money.

194
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:26,388
我將承擔你的債務 對你投注
I will assume your debts
and project upon you...

195
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:31,727
所有你從未擁有過的俏皮可愛
...all sorts of nifty qualities you've
never actually cultivated in yourself.

196
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:34,480
我會給你這所有甚至更多
I will give you all this and more...

197
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,483
直到我精疲力竭耗盡自己
...until l am so exhausted
and depleted...

198
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,486
只有一種方法我能復原
...the only way l can recover...

199
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,197
就是迷上另一個人
...is by becoming infatuated
with someone else.

200
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,623
- 伊莉莎白 嗨
- 嗨
-Elizabeth, hi.
-Hi.

201
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,416
哦 真的嗎?
Oh, really?

202
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,421
你好嗎?
How you doing?

203
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,454
乾杯
Cheers.

204
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,583
- 謝謝
- 我該和你說聲對不起
-Thank you.
-l owe you an apology.

205
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:40,629
- 我走神了
- 沒有 我不是人見人愛的那型
-For the walkouts.
-Well, l'm not everyone's cup of tea.

206
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,340
我很懷疑
I doubt that.

207
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:46,093
我呢 另一方面來說 就是坨屎
I, on the other hand, was shit.

208
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:51,640
- 雖然我很努力在演了
- ''屎''這個字重了
-Although l was trying very hard.
-"Shit" is a strong word.

209
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,517
多謝
Thank you.

210
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:56,645
你真人看起來比在台上矮一點
You seem shorter in person
than on the stage.

211
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,730
- 是嗎? 我老聽人這麼說
- 對不起
-Really? l hear that a lot.
-Sorry.

212
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,440
沒關係
It's okay.

213
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,360
當一個陌生人比自己能更清楚地
It's unnerving when...

214
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:07,489
看清自己時 讓人非常緊張
...a total stranger sees you
more clearly than you see yourself.

215
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,908
我說你矮是這個意思
That's what l mean
by saying you're short.

216
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,583
是不是現在聽到海豚的擊掌輕拍了?
Are you hearing dolphins clapping
right now?

217
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,337
我剛才看到你就冒昧自己編了那句
I took a few liberties
with your material.

218
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,799
現在我允許你盡情來取笑我
我知道你一定很想
I give you full permission to make
fun of me. I know you're dying to.

219
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,387
你太迷人了 我都不知道怎麼取笑你
You're far too charming
to make fun of.

220
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,019
還是海豚的擊掌輕拍
I'm still hearing them.

221
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:48,322
這是你的精神導師嗎?
Is that your guru?

222
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:52,284
你逗我的吧 不過 是的
You're joking, but, yes, it is.

223
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,495
她很美
She's beautiful.

224
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,332
嗯 一個朋友跟我說起的
Yeah. A friend told me about her.

225
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,127
當時我失業 極度渴望點寄托
I was out of work and feeling
pretty desperate for something.

226
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:05,130
不是我最近一次失業 是更之前的
Not the last time I was out of work,
the time before that.

227
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:10,552
我有一種感覺 我找的地方都不對
And l just had this feeling like
I was looking in all the wrong places.

228
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,970
找什麼?
Looking for what?

229
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,347
上帝
God.

230
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:18,268
她在印度有個修行的地方
我一直很想去 可是
She has an ashram in India.
I'm dying to go, but...

231
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:21,772
你知道啦 一定要達到一定級別
好像三級肝炎什麼的
...you know, you have to get, like,
three stages of hepatitis shots...

232
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,816
而且我的保險費總是透支
...and my insurance always runs out.

233
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,943
等時機成熟我就去
I'll go when the time's right.

234
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:30,280
她的徒弟每天早晨都聚會
There's a gathering of her students
every morning.

235
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,409
如果你願意 我想帶你去
If you want,
I could take you sometime.

236
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:39,915
如果你不會因為100個
唸著梵文的人緊張不安的話
If you're not unnerved by 100
crunchy people chanting in Sanskrit.

237
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,001
我需要緊張不安
I need to be unnerved.

238
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:17,577
大衛 來自紐約郊區的瑜伽信徒
David. A yogi from Yonkers.

239
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:22,499
其實我並沒有愛上他
I didn't exactly fall in love
with the guy.

240
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:26,586
我只是跳出了自己的婚姻
What happened was
I dove out of my marriage...

241
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,380
投入了大衛的懷抱
...and into David's arms...

242
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:31,800
就像卡通裏的馬戲演員
...exactly the same way
a cartoon circus performer...

243
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:36,596
從高高的跳台上跳下
投入一個小水杯裏
...dives off a high platform
and into a small cup of water...

244
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,473
然後消失得無影無蹤
...vanishing completely.

245
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,068
你的小內衣 女王陛下
Your underwear, my queen.

246
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,241
他剛剛疊好了我的貼身衣物
He just folded my delicates.

247
00:17:56,409 --> 00:18:00,120
哦 我的天 你有大麻煩了
Oh, my God, baby,
you are in so much trouble.

248
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:53,548
36樓?
Thirty-six?

249
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,731
我的委託人不想離婚
My client is simply not interested
in a divorce.

250
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,777
他是認真的?
Is he serious?

251
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,821
他真的要代表自己?
Is he really representing himself?

252
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,073
我可是上過一個學期的法學院的
One semester of law school
right here, baby.

253
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:20,992
很好 那怎麼才能
讓你的委託人想離婚呢?
Great. Well, what would it take
to interest your client?

254
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,746
好 這樣吧 你搞砸了我的生活
Okay, so here's the deal.
You have screwed up my life...

255
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:27,791
可是我想知道的是 你為什麼不能...
...but what l wanna know
is why couldn't you find yourself...

256
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:30,836
在我們的婚姻中找到你自己呢?
為什麼你不能說出自己的感受?
...in our marriage? Why didn't you
say what you were thinking?

257
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,505
- 我說了 你從來不聽我說話
- 不 你從來沒說過
-l did. You never listened to me.
-No. You never said:

258
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,424
''嘿 你知道嗎? 你爛透了
我非常非常得不快樂''
"Hey, you know what?
You suck. l'm deeply unhappy."

259
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,928
你只是起身離開 從來沒給我機會
來解決這些問題
You just took off. You never gave me
a chance to address those problems.

260
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:42,931
這不公平 你就這麼放棄了
我可是立了誓言的
That's not fair. That's just quitting.
I took vows.

261
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:46,017
死亡才能分開我們 我是認真的
Till death.
And l take them seriously.

262
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,396
我相信這只是一個階段
我們等一等就會過去的
I believe this is just a phase
and l'm willing to wait it out.

263
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:51,022
你總是在等待 史蒂芬
You are always waiting, Stephen.

264
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,441
等待我回家 等待我想要孩子...
Waiting for me to come home,
to wanna have kids...

265
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,278
等待我給你做晚飯
我不知道為什麼我們就不能接受...
...to make you dinner.
I don't know why we can't accept...

266
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,613
事實就是我們不想
再這麼不幸福地生活下去了
...we don't wanna live
in unhappiness anymore.

267
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,283
我承認我偶爾會讓你感覺靠不住
I accept the fact that
I am occasionally unreliable...

268
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,703
還經常分散注意力到別的事情上去
可我以為你就喜歡我這樣
...and l often get sidetracked,
but I thought you liked that about me.

269
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:07,205
我以為你就喜歡我擁有希望和理想
I thought it was okay
that I had hopes and dreams.

270
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:10,959
擁有理想 史蒂芬 很好 太好了
那就去實現啊 但只能選一樣
Have a dream. Stephen, great,
fine. Do that. Just pick one.

271
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,128
好 我選一樣 我選你
Okay, l pick one. I pick you.

272
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,348
我知道這很難受
I know this is awful.

273
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:31,396
但是我身體中的每一個分子都相信
你會找到那個...
But l believe with every molecule of
my body that you will find the person...

274
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:34,149
和你有共同理想的人
...that wants just what you want.

275
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:37,652
那個給予你所需要和值得的東西
而我不是那個人
That will give you what you want
and what you deserve. l'm not her.

276
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:42,157
顯然你根本不知道我需要什麼
Well, you obviously know nothing
about what l want.

277
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,495
我的委託人要呈上一首自編的歌曲
My client would like to submit
a song he wrote...

278
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:52,000
他認為此歌曲與本訴訟有關
這首歌是這樣的
...that he believes is relevant to these
proceedings. Goes something like this:

279
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,628
你開玩笑吧?
Are you kidding?

280
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,134
逃兵 逃兵 逃兵!
Quitter, quitter, quitter!

281
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:04,262
那算我錯了怎麼樣? 我不能再忍受
How about l take the blame?
I am the one who couldn't deal...

282
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,432
每個週末漫步在大型超市中...
...with another weekend roaming
some box-shaped superstore...

283
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,142
刷卡購買家用電器...
...buying appliances on credit...

284
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:13,480
假裝像別的夫妻一樣
其實我們都不知道什麼是婚姻
...and pretending to be a couple that
neither one of us ever knew how to be.

285
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:15,023
要買烤麵包機的人是你
You wanted that toaster.

286
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:20,528
你喜歡假裝 好吧 你很有耐力
我是失敗者 我不會假裝
"You like faking it, fine. You're stellar.
I'm the failure. l suck at faking it."

287
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:23,698
- 我表現得很潑婦
- 那現在事情進行到哪一步了?
-lt was not my finest hour.
-So where do things stand now?

288
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:26,284
我們準備提供所有財產的一半
We're prepared
to offer half of everything...

289
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:29,496
以及我委託人的退休賬戶
...and my client's retirement accounts.

290
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:32,874
都拿走吧 全給你
Take it all then. Everything.

291
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:35,377
他還是拒絕
He still said no.

292
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,672
- 他現在一定很恨我
- 他不恨你
-He hates me now.
-He doesn't hate you.

293
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,216
他只是心碎了
His heart is broken.

294
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:45,887
我覺得他恨你
I think he hates you.

295
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,014
小心我永遠把你鎖進地下室
I'm never letting you
out of the basement.

296
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:51,434
我們下周看事情怎麼樣了再談吧?
Why don't we talk next week
and we'll see where things stand?

297
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:53,186
- 好的
- 這種事情總有...
-Okay.
-These things have a way...

298
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:54,980
解決之道的
...of working themselves out.

299
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,830
你怎麼會成為素食主義者的?
So why'd you become a vegetarian?

300
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:14,249
有一次我看到好多牛被殺掉
I saw some cows slaughtered
one time.

301
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:16,251
基本沒吃晚飯啊
Barely touched your dinner.

302
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:18,753
他才28歲
He's 28.

303
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,676
這對他來說太苛刻了是吧?
那你呢?
This is hard for him, isn't it?
And you?

304
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,178
冥想挺有用的
The meditations help.

305
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,764
麗茲
Liz.

306
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:33,226
還記得幾年前
你廢寢忘食地...
You remember a couple of years ago,
when you threw yourself into...

307
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:36,062
重新裝修你家廚房?
當時看你...
...the renovation of your kitchen?
You were consumed...

308
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,148
多像個完美的妻子和家庭煮婦啊
...with being the perfect wife and cook.

309
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,733
我那只是試圖讓生活有點起色
I was trying to make it work.

310
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,777
那我認為頌歌和冥想也一樣...
Well, l think chanting and meditation
is the same thing...

311
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:44,612
...只是形式不同罷了
...in a different costume.

312
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:49,951
一定要把那紀錄片給我看看
Definitely give me that documentary.

313
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,078
我一直在考慮素食的問題
I've been thinking
about vegetarianism.

314
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:54,205
我的脂肪肝比屋頂都高了
My triglycerides
are through the roof.

315
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,707
沒問題 謝謝款待
Yeah. Thanks for everything.

316
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,917
我們也很高興
Great to meet you.

317
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:06,176
- 怎麼了?
- 沒什麼 只是...
-What?
-Nothing. lt's just...

318
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,303
...你過去看起來有點像史蒂芬
...you know,
you used to look like Stephen.

319
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:10,805
現在你看起來像大衛了
Now you kind of look like David.

320
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,599
懂我的意思嗎?
You know?

321
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:18,146
我想說的是 這跟人和自己的狗狗
越長越像差不多
What l meant was, you know how
people start resembling their dogs?

322
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,109
他這麼說是什麼意思
我們長得像同一隻狗?
Why would he say that,
we look like the same dog?

323
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:24,819
- 他在開玩笑
- 不好笑
-He was joking.
-Not funny.

324
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:27,530
他喝了五罐海尼根 喝醉了
Well, he had five Heinekens.
He was bombed.

325
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:29,908
一點都不好笑
Well, not funny.

326
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,535
我們不可能像同樣的狗
We don't look like the same dog.

327
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:38,792
就算是 你就是牧羊犬
我則是藏獒
If anything, you're a collie
and l'm a Tibetan mastiff.

328
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:51,971
別讓我做只能想念你的人
Don't you wanna give me a chance
to miss you.

329
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:15,829
起初你愛慕的對象...
It begins when
the object of your affection...

330
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:19,541
帶給你如魔幻般醉人的...
...bestows upon you
a heady hallucinogenic dose...

331
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,710
你連想都不敢想的東西...
...of something you've never
even dared to admit you wanted...

332
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:26,798
...情感的興奮劑
帶給你如狂風暴雨般的愛和激情
...an emotional speedball
of thunderous love and excitement.

333
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:30,260
很快你開始渴望
近乎癡迷地渴望那種關注...
Soon you start craving that attention
with the hungry obsession...

334
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,053
...如同上癮一般
...of any junkie.

335
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:35,723
當愛慕不再
你變得鬱鬱寡歡 神經質 更不用提...
When it's withheld, you turn sick,
crazy, not to mention resentful...

336
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:39,060
對使你陷入如此地步的人怨恨不已...
...of the dealer who encouraged
this addiction in the first place...

337
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:41,604
...而眼中已看不到美好的事物
...but now refuses to pony up
the good stuff.

338
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:44,732
我只是鬱悶 關心你而已
我就是不明白
Just frustrated, l'm concerned.
I don't understand.

339
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,401
你不懂什麼?
What don't you get?

340
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:48,653
到底怎麼回事?
你不再看著我的眼睛
What's going on?
You don't look me in the eye.

341
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:51,197
- 你沒...
- 沒人讓你整理床
-You don't finish your--
-Nobody's asking you to make the bed!

342
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:54,117
- 你不再跟我做愛!
- 有時候我沒性趣!
-You don't have sex with me!
-Sometimes I'm not in the mood!

343
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:56,911
真該死 他過去都是免費給的
Goddamn him, and he used to
give it to you for free.

344
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:00,081
接下來你發現
瘦弱的自己在角落裏發抖...
Next stage finds you skinny,
shaking in a corner...

345
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:02,250
...心想只要能再一次
擁有那種感覺...
...certain only that
you'd sell your soul...

346
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:04,502
...就算是靈魂你也願意出賣
...just to have that one thing
one more time.

347
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,297
那為什麼我們不談談?
攤開來說清楚?
Well, then why don't we discuss it?
Why don't we sort it?

348
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,800
- 為什麼不能像成年人一樣?
- 那好 我能有一點自己的空間嗎?
-Why don't we act like adults?
-Okay. Can I have a little space?

349
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:12,594
- 怎麼樣?
- 同時...
-How about that?
-Meanwhile...

350
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:16,180
...你愛慕的對象被你排擠
...the object of your adoration
is now repulsed by you.

351
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,225
- 你也不是總讓我感到難受的
- 真是安慰到我了
-You don't always make me miserable.
-There's a comfort.

352
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:22,854
我只是...偶爾回到家...
I just-- Sometimes l need to
come home...

353
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,273
...需要一些獨處的時間
...and have a little David time.

354
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:28,776
他看著你如同陌生人
He looks at you like someone
he's never met before.

355
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,695
- 這可以嗎?
- 噢 那真是不錯啊
-ls that okay?
-Yeah. No, it's fine.

356
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,948
我沒必要為這辯解
And not have to, like, you know,
justify it.

357
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:37,243
諷刺的是你卻不能責怪他
The irony is
you can hardly blame him.

358
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:40,788
因為看看自己吧 一團糟
I mean, check yourself out.
You're a mess.

359
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,458
即使你都無法認出自己
Unrecognizable
even to your own eyes.

360
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:45,627
你叫我搬過來
我來了
You asked me to come here?
Here l am.

361
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,629
但事情變了 不再是那樣了
And it turned into something else.

362
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:50,256
- 對吧?
- 你真是太幼稚了
-Didn't it?
-You are such a child.

363
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:57,805
- 好吧 我不想再這樣下去了
- 很好 太好了
-Right. I can't take this anymore.
-Great. Perfect.

364
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:01,309
你這樣真是有責任感啊
That's a great response
to a conversation.

365
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:02,518
見鬼
Goddamn it.

366
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:07,607
你最後來到了癡迷的最終階段
You have now reached
infatuation's final destination.

367
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:14,447
不帶一絲憐憫的自我貶低
The complete
and merciless devaluation of self.

368
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,024
你要走一年?
You wanna go away for a year?

369
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,318
你知道我今早醒來是什麼感覺嗎 迪莉亞?
Do you know what I felt
when l woke up, Delia?

370
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:57,073
什麼都沒有 沒有激情 沒有活力
沒有信仰 沒有靈感 一丁點都沒有
Nothing. No passion, no spark,
no faith, no heat. Absolutely nothing.

371
00:26:57,241 --> 00:27:00,451
我必須得擺脫這種可怕的情況
I've gotten past the point where
I can be calling this a bad moment.

372
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,955
我被嚇死了 天啊
這比死了還可怕...
And it just terrifies me. Jesus,
this is like worse than death to me...

373
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,958
...一想到從今以後我將一直如此
...the idea that this is the person
I'm gonna be from now on.

374
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,418
知道嗎 人人都這樣
You know what, This happens to people.

375
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,670
他們20幾歲墜入愛河
結婚生子...
They fall in love in their 20s,
get married...

376
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:13,798
...30幾歲買下帶花園和廚房的屋子...
...do the granite countertop,
white-picket fence in their 30s...

377
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,342
...又突然之間意識到
"我不應該這樣"
...and somewhere they realize,
"This is not for me."

378
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:20,013
然後他們意志消沉 覺得身處地獄
但還是得打起精神...
So they fail and they fall down,
they hurt like hell, they straighten up...

379
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,432
...到壓抑的辦公室來上班
...and march their asses
to the shrink's office.

380
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:26,102
- 沒人能一走了事
- 我沒有一走了事
-They can't just check out.
-l am not checking out.

381
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,770
我是需要改變
I need to change.

382
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:30,189
這裏有支持你的人 麗茲

你有愛你的朋友和親人
You have friends and family
who love you.

384
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:36,029
你感覺到我對你的愛和支持了嗎  沒有吧
And do you feel my love for you?
My support for you? No.

385
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,698
什麼都沒有 我就像個死人
There's, like, nothing. l have no pulse.

-What did you have for lunch?
-l don't know. A salad.

388

就是這樣 我以前對食物對人生
也是這種態度...
Exactly. l used to have this appetite
for food, for my life...

389
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:52,962
...現在都沒了
...and it is just gone.

390
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:58,843
我要去那些能讓我感到驚艷的地方
I wanna go someplace
where l can marvel at something.

- 你說起話來像個學生

-You're talking like a college kid.
-l've been acting like one.

393
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:09,228
從我15歲開始 我要麼在談戀愛
要麼在分手
Since I was 15, I've either been
with a guy or breaking up with a guy.

394
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:12,356
從未有過兩個星期的空閒...
I have not given myself
two weeks of a breather...

395
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,818
...去好好的考慮下自己
...to just deal with, you know, myself.

396
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:20,031
你跟大衛怎麼了?
What's going on
with you and David?

397
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:29,749
怎麼了 掉到床下了?
What, did you fall out?

398
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:32,126
我不知道如何適應這里
I don't know how to be here.

399
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:35,922
你想知道怎麼適應這里?
別在一直期待什麼了
You wanna know how to be here?
Stop constantly waiting for something.

400
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:45,306
我要先去意大利 之後去
大衛的精神導師在印度的靜修處
I'm going to Italy and then l'm going
to David's guru's ashram in lndia...

401
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:48,893
...這一年的最後我會去巴里島
...and l'm going to end the year
in Bali.

402
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,439
這就是我的計劃
That's what l'm gonna do.

403
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:56,275
真是難以辯駁
那沙灘真是不錯 但是為什麼?
That's harder to argue with.
The beaches are nice. But why?

404
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,444
- 科圖跟我說過
- 那個沒有牙齒的傢伙
-Ketut told me I would.
-Guy with no teeth.

405
00:28:58,612 --> 00:28:59,695
但你處於絕望之中...
When you're desperate...

406
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:02,365
...有這麼一個人
沒錯 他看起來是有點像尤達大師
...and some guy who,
yes, looks a little like Yoda...

407
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:05,785
...遞給你這樣一個預言
不得不相信點什麼
...hands you a prophecy,
you have to respond.

408
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:08,121
- 抗抑鬱藥要麼?
- 肯定
-Do you need a Xanax?
-Always.

409
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:12,458
好吧 我就說一句
說完這一句就不說了
Okay, l'm just gonna say it.
I'm gonna say it and be done with it.

410
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:13,709
如果沒用怎麼辦?
What if it doesn't work?

411
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:21,050
我整個人生就這樣裝進了
12平方英尺大小的隔間裏
My whole life
fits in a 1 2-foot-square box.

412
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:25,471
你知道這話我一天要聽幾次嗎?
You know how many times
I hear that in a day?

413
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:27,932
其中大部分人再也沒回來過
Most of them never come back
for their whole life.

414
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:33,980

身無分文又得了痢疾
I'll probably be back in a week,
penniless with dysentery.

417

走 走 走
Go, go, go.

422
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,176
你知道最好笑的是什麼?

This is the first time in my life
there's no one waiting at home for me.

424
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:51,015

I don't even have a home
to come back to.

425
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,516
老天 你會交到新朋友的

It'd be great to get away.

428

找間小別墅住一個月
Andy and l were talking about getting
a little villa in Florence for a month.

你知道我為什麼會這麼阻撓你嗎?
You know why l was giving you
such a hard time?

我愛的工作 老公 孩子
但是...
I love my job, my guy and my kid,

old Italian joke...

437
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,835

...about a poor man
who goes to church every day...

438
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:05,339
在一尊偉大的神像前祈禱說...
...and prays before the statue
of a great saint, begging:

439
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:12,138
"我敬愛的神啊 懇求你 懇求你
讓我中樂透獎吧"
"Dear saint, please, please, please
let me win the lottery."

440
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:15,766
最終 惱怒的神像動了起來...
Finally, the exasperated statue
comes to life...

441
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,144
低頭望著那祈禱的人說...
...and looks down at the begging man
and says:

442
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:23,733
"我的子民啊 也拜託你幫幫忙
先買張彩卷吧"
"My son, please, please, please
buy a ticket."

443
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:26,360
現在我算是聽懂這個笑話了
So now l get the joke.

444

00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:32,017
良藥
Therapist.

499
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:33,977
- 不會吧
- 很好 你得學點幽默感
-Come on.
-Good. You gotta learn humor.

500
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,646
- 才不是
- 來 乾杯
-lt's not.
-Come on. Cheers.

501
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:46,240
- 星期二五點我們繼續?
- 好的
-Shall we continue Tuesday at 5?
-Yes.

502
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:49,576
- 再來一瓶良藥?
- 當然
-With another bottle of the therapy?
-Of course.

503
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,121
- 你學得很快 麗茲
- 謝謝
-You're doing very well, Liz.
-Thank you.

504
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,456
當你學會些新東西時...
And you must be very polite
with yourself...

505
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:56,125
...你肯定很自豪
...when you learn something new.

506
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,085
是的 謝謝 我同意你的說法
Yes. Grazie, I agree.

507
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:01,797
但你的英語水準...
你跟我說這些不太合理吧?
But your English-- How are you
even talking to me like this right now?

508
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:04,508
應該是你教我多過我教你的
I think you're gonna teach me
more than I teach you.

509
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,593
你意大利語不錯 很好了
You have good Italian. Very good.

510
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:08,220
好吧
All right.

511
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:54,808
我孤身一人
I am alone.

512
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:56,263
我感到很愧疚
都到羅馬三周了...
I feel so guilty.
I've been in Rome for three weeks...

513
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:58,932
...我所做的一切只是
學會一點意大利語和吃東西
...all l've done is learn
a few ltalian words and eat.

514
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,934
你感到愧疚是因為你是美國人
You feel guilty
because you're American.

515
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:02,978
你們不懂得如何讓自己快樂
You don't know
how to enjoy yourself.

516
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:05,355
- 你說什麼?
- 是真的
-l beg your pardon?
-lt's true.

517
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,775
美國人知道怎麼娛樂
卻不知道什麼是快樂
Americans know entertainment,
but don't know pleasure.

518
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:12,195
這位是盧卡.斯帕蓋蒂
This is Luca Spaghetti, by the way,
you know.

519
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,906
你叫盧卡 斯帕蓋蒂(意大利麵)?
Your name is Luca Spaghetti?

520
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,950
是的 那是我家族的姓氏
Yes, that's what our family is called.

521
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:19,953
意大利麵是我們發明的
我是很認真的 聽我說
We invented it.
I'm serious. Listen to me.

522
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:22,497
你想知道問題的癥結所在麼? 美國人
You want to know your problem?
Americans.

523
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:25,083
你們工作太努力了
你們精疲力竭
You work too hard.
You get burned out.

524
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:27,919
當你們回到家 整個週末...
Then you come home
and spend the whole weekend...

525
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:30,714
...居然是穿著睡衣看一天的電視
...in your pajamas in front of the TV.

526
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:32,633
好像是這樣 差不多
That's not far off, actually.

527
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,970
但你們不知道什麼是快樂
還需要別人告訴你們才行
But you don't know pleasure.
You have to be told you've earned it.

528
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:40,057
有個廣告說
"是享受Miller(美樂啤酒)的時間了"
You see a commercial that says,
"It's Miller time"...

529
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:44,311
...然後你就想
"沒錯 我現在就去買一打"
...and you say, "That's right.
Now I will go to buy a six-pack."

530
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:49,316
然後就一口氣全喝了
第二天早上醒來 感覺糟透了
And drink the whole thing and wake up
the next morning and you feel terrible.

531
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:52,319
意大利人就不需要別人提醒
But an ltalian doesn't need
to be told.

532
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:56,698
有個意大利人被告知說
"你需要休息一下"...
He walks by a sign that says,
"you deserve a break today"...

533
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:58,325
...然後他說 "哦 這我知道...
...and he says, "Yeah, l know.

534
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:02,329
...所以我才計劃中午到你家...
That's why I'm planning on
taking a break at noon...

535
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:05,749
...休息一下 跟你妻子睡一覺"
...to go over to your house
and sleep with your wife."

536
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:09,836
我們稱之為 "dolcee far nirentee"
We call it "dolce far niente."

537
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,421
意思是...
It means...

538
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:15,509
...無所事事的快樂
意大利人是這方面的專家
...the sweetness of doing nothing.
We are masters of it.

539
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,232
他說沒錯 他說...
He's right. He says...

540
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,150
...你不能這樣學意大利語
...you can't learn ltalian like this.

541
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:36,738
你不僅要用嘴說 還要用手
You don't speak the language just with
your mouth, speak it with your hands.

542
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:37,948
像這樣?
Like this?

543
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:44,204
好啦 這是大聲嚷嚷
Okay. ls yelling.

544
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:49,459
"這菜太美味了"
'THAT MEAL WAS EXCELLENT'

545
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:01,054
"得了吧你"
'SUCK IT'

546
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:05,016
這些真讓人眼花繚亂
All this gives me a stomachache.

547
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:07,436
"去你媽的"
'SCREW YOU'

548
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:11,231
- 那好像是我鄰居羅蘭索
- 非常迷人(諷刺口吻)
-l think that's my neighbor Lorenzo.
-Charming.

549
00:44:14,736 --> 00:44:17,195
另一種 "去你媽的"
ANOTHER WAY
TO SAY 'SCREW YOU'

550
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:30,542
好了 開始點菜吧 我要...
So anyway, to start off l'd say....

551
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,377
抱歉
Excuse me.

552
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,962
過來一下
Come here.

553
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:37,674
都要六人份量...
For the table...

554
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:40,927
...一大盤猶式洋薊
...a big platter
of artichoke alla giudia...

555
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:42,596
...意式熏火腿配甜瓜...
...prosciutto with melon...

556
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:45,140
...意式奶酪燴茄子
...and eggplant
with ricotta affumicata.

557
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:48,018
乾酪沙司意大利麵...
Then spaghetti alla carbonara...

558
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,771
...兔肉沙司意式粗麵...
...pappardelle with ragu of rabbit...

559
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,898
...意式寬麵配蛤蜊
...and linguini with clams.

560
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:55,275
羅馬牛肚...
Then tripe alla romana...

561
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:56,443
...還有意式煎小牛肉火腿卷
...and saltimbocca.

562
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:59,613
以及兩升岡扎諾葡萄酒
And two more liters
of the vino sfuso from Genzano.

563
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:01,072
謝謝
Thank you.

564
00:45:03,493 --> 00:45:06,286
你辦到了 真棒
You did it. Yes.

565
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:08,455
麗茲.吉爾伯特  你現在是羅馬女人了
Liz Gilbert,
you are a Roman woman now.

566
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:10,916
僅僅是名譽頭銜而已
No, only honorary.

567
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,043
那才是真正的羅馬女人
That is a real Roman woman.

568
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:19,424
和跨種族的朋友一起
Yeah, with a lot
of international friends.

569
00:45:19,592 --> 00:45:21,134
要是我就一口咬了
That one, I'd bite.

570
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:24,846
也許你和羅馬有不同的詞
Maybe you and Rome
just have different words.

571
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:26,640
- 不同的詞?
- 是的
-Different words?
-Yeah.

572
00:45:26,808 --> 00:45:30,477
如果你認真想想
每個城市都有其獨特的詞
Yeah. lt's like each city has a word,
if you really think about it.

573
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:33,480
就像倫敦的詞是什麼?
Like, what is the word for London?

574
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:36,107
- 我說是 "窒息"
- 這我同意
-l would say "stuffy."
-l would agree with that.

575
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:39,653
- 斯德哥爾摩的呢?
- 開什麼玩笑 當然是 "舒適"
-What's the word for Stockholm?
-Are you kidding? "Conform."

576
00:45:39,821 --> 00:45:41,112
紐約呢?
And New York?

577
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,658
"慾望" 或者 "煤煙"
"Ambition" or "soot."

578
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,160
那羅馬的詞是什麼?
What's the word for Rome?

579
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,412
這有點難
It's kind of difficult to think about.

580
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,789
這問題不錯
It's classic.

581
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:52,457
"性感"
"Sex."

582
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:56,670
顯然
Of course.

583
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:26,700
那你的詞呢 麗茲
我很好奇 我想不出來
So, what's your word, Liz?
I'm curious. l can't figure it out.

584
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:28,535
這個嘛...
Well....

585
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:33,373
可能是...
It might be....

586
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:39,045
以 "女兒"開始
我做得挺好 之後是...
It started as "daughter."
I was good at that. And then...

587
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:42,382
..."妻子" 不怎麼樣
..."wife." Not so good.

588
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:44,384
"女友"
"Girlfriend."

589
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:47,053
也不怎麼樣
Not so good.

590
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,680
還有 "作家"
My word's "writer."

591
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:52,350
那些都是你曾做過的
但不代表你是個什麼樣的人 對吧?
Yeah, but that's what you do.
That isn't who you are, no?

592
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:55,020
或許你是個在尋找自己詞的女人
Maybe you're a woman
in search of her word.

593
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:12,579
蘇菲 我是麗茲 我們去那不勒斯吧
或許我的詞就是"披薩"
Hey, Sofi, it's Liz. Let's go to Naples.
Maybe my word is "pizza."

594
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:30,680
聽著 女士 雖然我只有7歲
但是我看得出來你腦袋有問題...
Listen, lady, I am only 7, but l
can tell you're a complete moron...

595
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:33,183
...因為我是那不勒斯人
...because I am from Naples.

596
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:36,061
我喜歡這地方
但喬凡尼說來這裏得提高警惕
I love this place,
but Giovanni said to watch out.

597
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:38,772
他堂兄在這裏被搶了
還是在博物館裏
His cousin got mugged here
in a museum.

598
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,441
- 當真?
- 真的 要當心騎摩托車的
-Are you serious?
-Watch out for the scooter. Yeah.

599
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:58,959
我戀愛了 我愛上披薩了
I'm in love. l'm having
a relationship with my pizza.

600
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:02,420
你好像跟你的披薩分手了 怎麼了?
You look like you're breaking up
with the pizza. What's the matter?

601
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:03,797
我不能吃
I can't.

602
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:06,424
你不能吃是什麼意思?
這是那不勒斯的披薩
What do you mean, you can't?
This is pizza in Napoli.

603
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,760
享受這披薩是你應盡的義務
It is your moral imperative
to eat that pizza.

604
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:13,264
我也想吃 但我長胖了大概10磅
I want to,
but I've gained, like, 10 pounds.

605
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,433
我是說 我在這有...
I mean, l've got this....

606
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:17,811
就這位置 那叫什麼? 怎麼說的?
Right here. What's it called?
What's the word?

607
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:20,313
游泳圈
A muffin top.

608
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:22,816
我也有
I have one too.

609
00:48:22,984 --> 00:48:25,735
5分鐘前我鬆開紐扣看著它
I unbuttoned my jeans
five minutes ago just looking at this.

610
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,195
我問你
Let me ask you a question.

611
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:30,448
這麼多年來 每當你在這麼多的男人面前脫衣服...
In all the years you've ever
undressed in front of a gentleman....

612
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:34,285
- 沒有很多男人
- 好吧 那...
-Hasn't been that many.
-All right, well...

613
00:48:34,704 --> 00:48:36,329
他有要你離開嗎?
...has he ever asked you to leave?

614
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:39,290
- 他自己有離開? 走掉?
- 沒有
-Has he ever walked out? Left?
-No.

615
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:41,126
因為他不介意
Because he doesn't care.

616
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:44,004
他和一個裸女共處一室 他中獎了
He's in a room with a naked girl.
He's won the lottery.

617
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:48,008
我已厭倦了"控制食量" 還要在早晨醒來...
I'm so tired of saying no
and then waking up in the morning...

618
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:51,136
...回想昨日吃過的每樣東西
...and recalling every single thing
I ate the day before.

619
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:53,346
計算攝入的卡路里以便準確得知...
Counting every calorie
so l know exactly...

620
00:48:53,514 --> 00:48:56,474
...究竟有多少自我厭惡感被帶進了浴室
...how much self-loathing
to take into the shower.

621
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:58,518
我討厭這樣
I'm going for it.

622
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:02,022
我不想變成胖子 我只是把內疚感拋之腦後
I have no interest in being obese.
I'm just through with the guilt.

623
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,983
我要做的 就是把這比薩餅搞定...
This is what l'm gonna do.
I'm gonna finish this pizza...

624
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:07,986
...然後我們去看足球比賽
...and then we're gonna go
watch the soccer game.

625
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:10,572
...到了明天再一起出外
And tomorrow we're gonna go
on a little date...

626
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:14,159
...給自己買幾件更大號的牛仔褲
...and buy ourselves
some bigger jeans.

627
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:17,829
喬凡尼喜歡游泳圈
Giovanni likes a muffin.

628
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:22,208
真乖
Attagirl.

629
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:38,892
他在說"你是為誰效力的?"
He's saying,
"For whom are you playing?"

630
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:40,310
為誰
Per chi, for whom.

631
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:50,111
拉 拉 我在用力塞進去
Pull, pull. l'm sucking it in.

632
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:53,531
給它來點瑞典式蠻力
Put some Swedish muscle into this.

633
00:49:57,912 --> 00:49:59,913
你覺得這也發生在蘇菲亞·羅蘭(義大利電影女演員)身上嗎?
You think this happened
to Sophia Loren?

634
00:50:00,081 --> 00:50:01,539
就是這樣 差不多了
There it goes. Almost got it.

635
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,418
加油 加油 你都沒在用力
Go, go, go. You're not trying.

636
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:10,048
快成功了 快成功了 我做到了
I've almost got it. l've almost got it.
I did it.

637
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,074
真漂亮 你該買下來
Oh, that's beautiful.
You should get it.

638
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,369
為誰而買?
For whom?

639
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:42,622
為你自己 麗茲 就為你自己
For you, Liz. Just for you.

640
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,962
不了 我買大號褲子就好
No, I'm happy just
with my big lady pants.

641
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:08,398
今天感謝你 還有為我騰出座位
Thanks for the day.
And the leg room.

642
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:11,317
那很有意思
It was fun.

643
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,113
我們要去吃東西 要來嗎?
We're gonna go for food.
Wanna come?

644
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:17,824
不了
No. No, l'm good.

645
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,679
無所事事的快樂
The sweetness of doing nothing.

646
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,736
求你 求你從地板上起來
Please. Please get off the floor.

647
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:48,039
能不能請你...? 可以上來這嗎?
Will you please just...?
Will you come up here?

648
00:52:57,883 --> 00:53:02,512
我們彼此都知道這段關係被搞砸了...
What if we just acknowledge that
we have a screwed-up relationship...

649
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,556
但無論如何 我們依然堅持到底
你覺得這樣如何?
...and we stick it out anyway?

650
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:10,103
我們承認彼此間有很多爭吵...
We accept that we fight a lot...

651
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:13,106
...幾乎不再做愛...
...and we hardly have sex anymore...

652
00:53:13,274 --> 00:53:17,026
...但彼此都不希望失去了對方
...but that we don't wanna
live without each other.

653
00:53:17,486 --> 00:53:20,655
雖然我倆共同生活是如此...
And that way we can spend
our lives together...

654
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:22,865
...痛苦...
...miserable...

655
00:53:23,993 --> 00:53:26,953
...但依然樂於彼此間沒走向分離
...but happy not to be apart.

656
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:36,713
親愛的大衛:
Dear David:

657
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,965
有好一段日子沒聯繫了...
We haven't had any communication
in a while...

658
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:42,135
...那給了我時間思考
...and it's given me time
I needed to think.

659
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:45,888
還記得你說過為了彼此的快樂...
Remember when you said we should
live with each other and be unhappy...

660
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,390
...我們要為對方不快樂的活著?
...so we could be happy?

661
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:49,809
把那想成是我對你的愛之宣言吧...
Consider it a testimony
to how much I love you...

662
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:52,645
...我花了長時間試圖實現那宣言...
...that I spent so long
pouring myself into that offer...

663
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:54,981
...努力希望能成功
...trying to make it work.

664
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:58,318
但在某天 我被朋友帶到那神奇的地方
But a friend took me to the most
amazing place the other day.

665
00:53:58,485 --> 00:53:59,986
它名叫奧古斯都堡
It's called the Augusteum.

666
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:03,906
奧大維.奧古斯建造了它
以作為自己的存世之作
Octavian Augustus built it
to house his remains.

667
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:07,493
當外族入侵來到 他們把它跟
其他東西一樣當廢物毀掉了
When the barbarians came, they
trashed it along with everything else.

668
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:11,164
羅馬史上首位偉大的君主奧古斯...
The great Augustus,
Rome's first true great emperor...

669
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,291
...他又怎能想像到羅馬...
...how could he have imagined
that Rome...

670
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:17,003
...他的心能與之顧及到的整個世界
會成為斷壁殘垣?
...the whole world, as far as he was
concerned, would be in ruins?

671
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:20,923
在黑暗的中世紀
有人來到這把君主的骨灰偷走了
During the Dark Ages, someone came
in here and stole the emperor's ashes.

672
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,593
在12世紀 它成了一軍事堡壘...
In the 12th century,
it became a fortress...

673
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:25,136
...然後是鬥牛場
...then a bullring.

674
00:54:25,304 --> 00:54:27,305
之後他們就把這變成了儲存木柴的地方
They stored fireworks in here
after that.

675
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,683
如今 它是無家可歸者的澡堂...
Nowadays, it's a bathroom
for the homeless...

676
00:54:30,893 --> 00:54:33,686
...你要小心別踩空
...so you better watch your step
going down.

677
00:54:36,315 --> 00:54:40,693
那裏是羅馬城最安靜和最孤獨的地方之一
It's one of the quietest
and loneliest places in Rome.

678
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:44,322
城市已經在它周圍成長了幾個世紀
The city has grown up
around it over centuries.

679
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:46,491
它就如一珍貴的傷口...
It feels like a precious wound...

680
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:50,370
就如破碎的心
那傷痛之深刻以致你無法釋懷
...like a heartbreak you won't let go of
because it hurts too good.

681
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,705
我就喜歡凌亂
I like it messy.

682
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:56,042
我們都希望一切如舊 大衛
We all want things
to stay the same, David.

683
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:58,878
我猜你的前任肯定是個天使 對吧?
I guess the guy before me
must've been some angel, huh?

684
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:00,421
在痛苦中過著安定的生活...
Settle for living in misery...

685
00:55:00,589 --> 00:55:03,674
...因為我們害怕改變
害怕事物會變得支離破碎
...because we're afraid of change,
of things crumbling to ruins.

686
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:08,388
我環看這四周 處在一團混亂中....
Then I looked around in this place,
at the chaos it's endured...

687
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:11,391
...它忍受著自身被(環境)改變
被焚燒 被掠奪...
...the way it's been adapted,
burned, pillaged...

688
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:15,812
...然後找到重塑自己的方式
(那一刻)我就釋然了
...then found a way to build itself
back up again, and I was reassured.

689
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:19,232
或許我的人生沒如此複雜混亂
世界就是這個樣子而已...
Maybe my life hasn't been so chaotic.
It's just the world that is...

690
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:23,027
...需要注意的是
它正觸及(我人生的)各方面
...and the only real trap
is getting attached to any of it.

691
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:26,239
毀滅是一份恩賜
Ruin is a gift.

692
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:29,575
毀滅是通往改變的道路
Ruin is the road to transformation.

693
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,411
嗨
Hey.

694
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:33,579
可以走了嗎?
You ready?

695
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:36,332
可以
Yeah.

696
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:46,217
儘管在這座永恆的城市
奧古斯都堡依然向我展示了...
Even in this eternal city,
the Augusteum showed me...

697
00:55:46,385 --> 00:55:50,763
...我們應該為永無休止的改變做好準備
...that we must always be prepared
for endless waves of transformation.

698
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:57,520
比起綁在一起 我們都應該過得更好...
Both of us deserve better
than staying together...

699
00:55:57,688 --> 00:56:00,898
...不要害怕分開帶來的傷害
...because we're afraid
we'll be destroyed if we don't.

700
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:01,709
- 我母親正在填塞料
- 硬麵包 胡桃 拿那些過來
My mother's stuffing.
Stale bread, walnuts, got those.

701
00:57:01,877 --> 00:57:04,128
能多拿點馬鈴薯給我嗎?
Will you get me
some more potatoes?

702
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:06,339
我總是要幫你拿多點馬鈴薯
Oh, l'm always getting you
more potatoes.

703
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:09,800
那是我的夢想 過上地道的美式感恩節
It's my dream,
a real American Thanksgiving.

704
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:13,179
那是向麗茲送行的最好方式
The perfect way to say goodbye
to our Liz.

705
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,349
那麼...
So...

706
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:19,560
- 你要在這周離開嗎?
- 是的
- ...you leave this week, huh?
-Yes.

707
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,813
要去哪 伊朗?
And where are you going? lran?

708
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:24,690
印度
India.

709
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:29,445
麗茲今晚為我們帶來了真實的美國風
Liz is making us
an American meal tonight.

710
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:32,573
- 你還沒結婚吧?
- 沒有
-You are not married, yeah?
-No.

711
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:36,494
你朋友是怎麼了? 她是拉拉嗎?
What's wrong with your friend,
is she a lesbian?

712
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:42,542
不 媽媽 她不是拉拉
還有 她聽得懂意大利語
No, Mama, she's not a lesbian.
And she understands ltalian.

713
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:44,877
她在世界的另一邊...
How's she going to find
another husband and start a family...

714
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:47,713
...怎麼可能找到丈夫與之共築愛巢呢?
...when she's on the other side
of the world?

715
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:53,553
如果有男人說"我願以一年時間作交換
用來結識好朋友..."
If a man said, "l'm going to travel for
a year and meet wonderful people...."

716
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,221
她又不是男人
But she's not a man.

717
00:57:55,764 --> 00:58:01,018
對女人來說 要讓自己有選擇的權利是很困難的
It's more difficult for a woman to feel
that she has the right to make choices.

718
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:03,896
- 那需要很大勇氣
- 正是
-lt takes a lot of courage.
-Exactly.

719
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:07,233
你說是勇氣 我認為是愚蠢
You call it courage, I call it stupidity.

720
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:09,193
媽 夠了
Mama, enough.

721
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:12,613
我知道有很多人會同意你的看法
I know a number of people
who would agree with you.

722
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,241
盧卡?
Luca?

723
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:17,410
火雞什麼時候能好?
What time will the turkey be ready?

724
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,704
火雞....
The turkey....

725
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:21,247
我還沒解凍
I haven't defrosted it yet.

726
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:26,627
該死
Oh, shit.

727
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:29,422
只要你做這件事 你竟然搞砸了
You only had one thing to do
and you screwed it up.

728
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:32,883
我分神了 常有的事
I was distracted! It can happen!

729
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:34,885
好吃的東西太多
Too much good food!

730
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,887
女人太多
Too many women!

731
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:38,973
然後我就忘了
And l forgot!

732
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:41,267
我們在吃之前 各位...
Now, before we eat, everyone...

733
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:44,395
...感恩節 讓我們來做感恩禱告
...it is Thanksgiving,
so let us give thanks.

734
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:47,273
- 來吧 手拉手
- 好的
-Yeah. Come on, join hands.
-Okay.

735
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:49,567
就說我們...
So we just say what we....

736
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:53,654
我們今晚要感謝上帝
蘇菲 要不你先來?
What we thank God for tonight.
Sofi, why don't you start?

737
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:59,452
我感謝你 麗茲...
I am grateful for you, Liz...

738
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:03,956
...你幫我熱愛生活...
...for helping me appreciate life...

739
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:07,460
....以及這種熱愛帶來的一切...
...with all that comes with it...

740
00:59:08,462 --> 00:59:11,213
...游泳圈和不開心的日子
...muffin tops and bad times.

741
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:12,923
對於喬凡尼...
And for Giovanni...

742
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:16,052
...感謝你讓我感受到了...
...for making me feel...

743
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,803
...愛與安全感
...loved and secure.

744
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:21,641
到朱利歐
And Giulio.

745
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:25,686
我對家庭表示感激
Me, l'm grateful for
my beautiful family.

746
00:59:25,854 --> 00:59:28,230
我的妻子和兩個女兒
My two little daughters and my wife.

747
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:32,735
我感謝主和聖女...
I thank God and the Holy Virgin...

748
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:34,904
...為我們帶來如此特別的日子
...for this very, very special day.

749
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:38,991
如此美好的家庭...
And for this beautiful family...

750
00:59:39,451 --> 00:59:40,910
...那讓今天的意義變得更重大

751
00:59:42,371 --> 00:59:43,496
非常重大

752
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:52,505
我感謝你帶來這種新的慶祝方式

01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:19,824
繼續啊 喬凡尼

我感謝主...
I thank God for...

761
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:25,329
...賜予我惶恐感...
...fear...

762
01:00:25,497 --> 01:00:29,375
...因為這是首次...
...because for the first time...

763
01:00:30,252 --> 01:00:33,087
...害怕坐在我旁的...
...l'm afraid the person next to me...

764
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,173
...將會是想離開的那一方
...will be the one who wants to leave.

765
01:00:41,722 --> 01:00:43,431
麗茲?
Liz?

766
01:00:45,517 --> 01:00:50,187
我感激所有這一切
Well, this all makes me so grateful.

767
01:00:51,523 --> 01:00:53,566
看到你們這群快樂的人...
Seeing all you happy people...

768
01:00:53,734 --> 01:00:57,278
...你們懂得互愛和互助
...who know how to love each other
and take care of each other.

769
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:03,200
我看著那讓我無比仰慕的出色女人...
I look at the amazing women l've met
who l admire so much...

770
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:08,456
...還有男人 照顧著自己的女人...
...and the great men,
taking care of their women...

771
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:11,459
...抱自己的孩子上床
...and putting their children to bed.

772
01:01:12,961 --> 01:01:15,296
我感到開心...
I just feel happy...

773
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:19,467
...看見並參與到其中
...to see it and to be part of it.

774
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:27,308
我是世界上最幸運的女孩
I'm the luckiest girl in the world.

775
01:02:55,063 --> 01:02:57,565
早餐真美味 對吧?
It's a good breakfast, huh?

776
01:04:22,734 --> 01:04:24,944
我把這些帶到你房間去
I will take this to your room.

777
01:04:30,075 --> 01:04:31,951
已經開始了
It has already started.

778
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:20,958
- 我睡著了
- 是的 遺憾啊
-l fell asleep.
-Yeah. Pity.

779
01:05:21,126 --> 01:05:25,337
你可能是世上第一個在冥思中睡著的人
Probably the only person in the world
who ever fell asleep during meditation.

780
01:05:32,971 --> 01:05:36,557
- 這路通往冥想園
- 精神導師在這嗎?
-This leads to the meditation garden.
-ls the guru here?

781
01:05:36,725 --> 01:05:40,102
- 一直都在
- 我意思是 她真的在這裡嗎?
-She's always here.
-l know, but is she "here" here?

782
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:42,354
她現在紐約的修行地
She's at her ashram in New York.

783
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:44,898
但我是從紐約來這看她的
But l came from New York
to see her here.

784
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:47,735
聽著像是她玩的小把戲
Sounds like one of her little tricks.

785
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:53,741
冥想室
The meditation cave.

786
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:58,954
全天候開放 帶空調
It's open 24/7
and it's air-conditioned.

787
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:08,464
科瑞拉?
Corella?

788
01:06:08,757 --> 01:06:12,468
- 這是麗茲.吉爾伯特
- 很高興見到你
-This is Liz Gilbert.
-Hi. Nice to meet you.

789
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:19,433
- 你在哪得到這胸牌的?
- 在書店有賣
-Where did you get that button?
-They sell them in the bookstore.

790
01:06:19,601 --> 01:06:23,187
那正是我需要的 我不聆聽
That is exactly what I need. I need
something like that. l don't listen.

791
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:26,273
我一直都是這樣
我媽過去總是稱呼我"嘰嘰喳喳小姐"
I never have. My mom used to
call me Little Miss Chatty Cathy...

792
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:28,358
...因為我這人是話多嘮叨 我是嘮叨鬼
...because I just ramble.
I am a rambler.

793
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:31,403
我現在就在嘮叨了 對不起
I am rambling now. l'm sorry.

794
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:34,114
沉默是一種美妙的精神練習...
Silence is a wonderful
spiritual practice...

795
01:06:34,282 --> 01:06:38,077
...如果科瑞拉能說話 她會告訴你
做起來比看著更有挑戰性
...but if Corella could speak, she'd tell
you it's more challenging than it looks.

796
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:41,121
- 你可能要過一段時間再試
- 好的
-Wait till you've been here for a while.
-Okay.

797
01:06:53,301 --> 01:06:56,136
謝謝你 科瑞拉 我會轉告她的
Thank you, Corella.
I'll be sure to tell her.

798
01:06:56,304 --> 01:06:58,639
- 她說什麼了?
- 不知道
-What did she say?
-No idea.

799
01:06:58,807 --> 01:07:01,475
換上工作服 我要把你帶進seva(服務)
Change into your work clothes.
I'll take you to your seva.

800
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:04,311
那是印度語 意為"無私奉獻的工作"
It's a Hindu word
for "selfless devotional work."

801
01:07:04,479 --> 01:07:08,524
- 每個留下來的人都必須做
- 好的 謝謝你
-lt's required of everyone who stays.
-Okay. Thank you.

802
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:38,679
世上還有比印度青少年更瘦小的同齡人嗎?
Is there anything in this world skinnier
than an lndian teenage boy?

803
01:07:41,266 --> 01:07:43,142
- 我叫圖絲  - 麗茲

-l'm Tulsi.
-Liz.

804
01:07:43,685 --> 01:07:44,852
你來自哪裏?
Where are you from?

805
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:48,981
隔壁村 我父母皈依精神導師很多年了
The next town. My parents have been
devotees of the guru for many years.

806
01:07:49,149 --> 01:07:50,524
我們花很多時間在這
We spend a lot of time here.

807
01:07:50,692 --> 01:07:52,359
可是...
But...

808
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:55,946
他們要把我嫁出去 這裏的傳統
...they are trying to marry me off.
That's the custom.

809
01:07:56,114 --> 01:08:00,492
- 那不是你想要的?
- 才不 那糟透了
-That's not what you want?
-No way. lt sucks.

810
01:08:05,373 --> 01:08:10,210
我想跟精神導師一樣 上大學修讀心理學
I want to study psychology, just as our
guru did when she attended college.

811
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:13,547
在這年紀 我選擇與主而不是與男孩一起
I prefer to be with God
than boys my age.

812
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:17,342
家裏沒人明白我大老遠跑來印度是為何
No one in my family understands
my coming all the way to India.

813
01:08:17,886 --> 01:08:21,847
你曾否有過看著他們在想
"我待在這個家是幹什麼?"
Do you ever look at them and wonder,
"What am I doing in this family?"

814
01:08:22,849 --> 01:08:24,224
那你可無法想像
You have no idea.

815
01:08:51,002 --> 01:08:55,589
這古老的精神詩文內容包含了182篇詩文
The Guru Gita is an ancient text
1 82 verses long.

816
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:58,884
裏面說 巴瓦娣女神問濕婆神
或者叫上帝...
In it, the goddess Parvati
is asking Shiva, or God...

817
01:08:59,427 --> 01:09:01,261
...(怎樣)實行的秘密
...for the secrets of fulfillment.

818
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:05,474
上帝說 那需要轉化的特質
It's said to have
transforming qualities.

819
01:09:05,934 --> 01:09:09,311
我想冒昧地說一下...
I would just like to take a risk here
and say....

820
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:13,690
精神導師和我處得不太好
Me and Guru Gita,
we just do not get along.

821
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:16,693
- 你有什麼困難?
- 所有的一切
-What is it you have trouble with?
-Everything.

822
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,988
它如此冗長沉悶 我跟不上
It's long, it's tedious,
I can't keep up...

823
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:24,993
...然後它讓我對生活中所有事物
都抱有神經質般的焦慮...
...and l get these insane anxieties
about everything in my life...

824
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,912
...我已經找不到屬於自己的位置了
...and l've lost my place.

825
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:28,997
聽來像是起了很好的作用...
Sounds like it has a positive effect...

826
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:32,584
...能讓你在情感上和行為上有這麼強烈的反應
...if you're having such strong
emotions and physical reactions.

827
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:35,879
你繼續努力
You keep trying.

828
01:09:43,805 --> 01:09:46,181
你結束婚姻的舉動真是讓人敬佩
It is most commendable
that you ended your marriage.

829
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:49,267
你現在是個自由快樂的人了
You seem like such a
happy, free person now.

830
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:52,479
我想前夫會說我自私
I think my ex-husband
would describe me as selfish.

831
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:57,150
你不該對自己生氣或失望
You mustn't be angry with yourself
or disappointed.

832
01:09:57,318 --> 01:10:01,321
你不用為生孩子或結婚組建家庭而煩惱
You don't have to make children
or be married to have a family.

833
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:06,159
天 這裏的蚊子個頭真大...
Oh, man. They got mosquitoes
here big enough...

834
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:08,662
...直接就伏在上面 把雞給幹掉了
...to stand flat-footed
and screw a chicken.

835
01:10:09,998 --> 01:10:12,165
- 我好崇拜你
- 麗茲 你見過...
-l love you.
-Liz, have you met...

836
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:14,668

- 你好 來自德州的理查
-...Richard from Texas?
-Hello, Richard from Texas.

837
01:10:14,836 --> 01:10:17,170
- 很高興見到你 食品雜貨小姐  - 食品雜貨?
-Nice to meet you, Groceries.
-Groceries?

838
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:20,507
- 是的
- 見到你之前我聽到你在吃東西
Yeah. Yeah, l heard you eating
before l saw you.

839
01:10:20,717 --> 01:10:23,510
我從沒見過有人能一次吃那麼多
I never seen anybody
eat so much at one time.

840
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:26,013
你的確挺享受你的食物
You sure do enjoy your groceries.

841
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:30,809
要知道 今天很難熬
如果大家不介意的話
You know, it's been a rough day,
and if no one takes it personally...

842
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:34,813
...我另找地方能安靜地吃完這頓飯
...l'm going to take my large meal
someplace else to eat it in silence.

843
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:37,149
不用 留下吧 我吃完了
Oh, no, stay. I'm done.

844
01:10:41,529 --> 01:10:43,655
看來你今天早上聊了些.
Looked like you were
working through some...

845
01:10:43,823 --> 01:10:46,491
挺痛苦的話題
...pretty rough stuff this morning.

846
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:48,535
有關你前夫的?
Stuff with your ex-husband?

847
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:51,496
我有個前妻
I got an ex-wife.

848
01:10:52,123 --> 01:10:55,167
她想我是把名字改成了"王八羔子"
She thinks l changed my name
to "Motherfucker."

849
01:10:58,546 --> 01:11:00,380
我--
I--

850
01:11:00,882 --> 01:11:05,886
我在羅馬待了些日子
剛來這兒時我感覺很好
I just spent some time in Rome
and l came here feeling so great.

851
01:11:06,054 --> 01:11:09,514
現在我心底有種...
And now here l am, at the source...

852
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:12,559
...從未有過的隔絕
...and l feel more disconnected
than ever.

853
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:15,020
你為什麼來這裏?
Why'd you come here?

854
01:11:16,564 --> 01:11:17,898
想在這裏找到安寧
I just want some peace.

855
01:11:18,483 --> 01:11:20,233
安寧?
Peace?

856
01:11:21,861 --> 01:11:24,529
要想到達城堡(意思想得到想要的一切)
食品雜貨小姐...
You wanna get
to the castle, Groceries...

857
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:26,281
...你必須游過護城河
(必須通過自身艱苦主動的努力)
...you got to swim the moat.

858
01:11:29,577 --> 01:11:32,579
給你 我知道你能吃完的
Here, you can finish that.
I know you can.

859
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:40,087
好的
Okay.

860
01:11:40,588 --> 01:11:44,299
簡單地清空雜念
Simply empty your mind.

861
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:45,926
呼吸
Breathe.

862
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:51,389
這年我都幹什麼了?
What am l going to do
when this year is over?

863
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:53,266
我將要到哪去住?
Where am I going to live?

864
01:11:53,434 --> 01:11:54,726
芝加哥吧 也許
Well, maybe Chicago.

865
01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:59,397
對了 我可以建個冥想室
Oh, my God.
I could build a meditation room--

866
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:03,568
不 別想了 為何就這麼難?
No. Stop thinking.
Why is this so hard?

867
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:11,743
去你的 科瑞拉 她是怎樣做到的?
Screw you, Corella.
How the hell does she do this?

868
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:14,538
她就像那該死的德雷莎修女
She looks like
frigging Mother Teresa.

869
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:19,459
天呀 殺了我吧
Oh, my God, kill me.

870
01:12:22,547 --> 01:12:24,131
- 今天誰泡在護城河裏了?
- 閉嘴
-Who's in the moat today?
-Shut up.

871
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,466
看來你被鱷魚纏上了
Sounds like you wrestled
some big-ass crocs.

872
01:12:26,634 --> 01:12:29,886
要是你這麼聰明 幹嘛還待在這?
You know what? lf you're so goddamn
smart, what are you doing here?

873
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:31,972
你能來這已經是一個聰明的舉動
If you're here,
it makes you smart already.

874
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:35,433
- 你要談談嗎?
- 對著你不用 謝謝
-Do you wanna talk about what--?
-No, not to you. Thank you.

875
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:38,645
這裏只有我在 你遲早點都要說的
I'm the only one here. You're gonna
talk about it sooner or later.

876
01:12:38,855 --> 01:12:39,938
我在那裏精神不能集中
I cannot focus in there.

877
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:44,359
腦裏想的都是怎樣裝潢冥想室
All I think about is my meditation room
and how to decorate.

878
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,487
你在跟我耍花樣嗎?
Are you shitting me?

879
01:12:48,322 --> 01:12:49,322
你在跟我開玩笑嗎?
Are you kidding me?

880
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:52,826
冥想室存在於內心 食品雜貨小姐
還裝潢它
The meditation room is within,
Groceries. Decorate that.

881
01:12:52,994 --> 01:12:54,786
你說話時總是喜歡闡明宗教立場的嗎?
Do you always talk
in bumper sticker?

882
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:56,329
是的 這裏還有一句
I do, and here's another one.

883
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:59,499
你必須像每天選擇衣服一樣...
You have to learn to select
your thoughts the way you select...

884
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:02,502
...選擇自己的思維
這是你可以培養出來的能力
...your clothes every day.
That's a power you can cultivate.

885
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:05,922
你過來這是為了掌控自己的生活
You wanna come here and control
your life so bad, work on the mind.

886
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:07,966
從意念著手 那才是你該掌控的地方
That's the only thing
you should control.

887
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:10,802
如果不能掌控思維 你麻煩就大了
If you can't master your thoughts,
you're in trouble.

888
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:12,012
我在嘗試中
I am trying.

889
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:15,182
這正是問題所在 別嘗試了 投降吧
Yeah, hello, that's the damn problem.
Stop trying. Surrender.

890
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:18,852
就到院子裏坐著 停止一切想法...
Go out into the garden
and just sit there and still your mind...

891
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,520
...然後看會有什麼事發生
...and you watch what happens.

892
01:13:20,688 --> 01:13:22,522
為何你就不能放手?
Why don't you just let it be?

893
01:13:24,525 --> 01:13:27,027
有人說過你像詹姆斯泰勒(歌手)嗎?
Has anyone ever told you
you look like James Taylor?

894
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:32,908
每天都有
Every day.

895
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:42,083
天 他還真像
God, he really does.

896
01:13:47,215 --> 01:13:48,882
我父母一直是那樣
My prayers were always the same.

897
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:53,220
"神啊 求求你 向我敞開心扉 給我神啟"
"Please, God, please.
Open my heart, send me a sign...

898
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:57,140
因為我們都知道我不是屋裏最鋒利的工具
(不是最聰穎 最有神性的人)
...because we both know
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed."

899
01:13:58,893 --> 01:14:01,228
看看你 神遊到加爾各答去了
(印度東北部港口城市)
Look at you,
floating through Calcutta.

900
01:14:01,896 --> 01:14:04,022
看來你有了次很棒的冥想
Looks like you had
a great meditation.

901
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:05,899
我也許患上了瘧疾
I probably have malaria now.

902
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:07,525
痛楚會消失的
The bites will go away.

903
01:14:08,069 --> 01:14:09,903
最終 所有一切都會消失
Eventually everything goes away.

904
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:12,739
祈求神啟 你之前做過嗎 食品雜貨小姐?
You ever done that, Groceries?
Begged for a sign?

905
01:14:14,742 --> 01:14:16,076
這曖昧的意蘊聽著怪熟悉的
That sounds vaguely familiar.

906
01:14:16,244 --> 01:14:18,703
小心所許的願 有可能會成真的
Be careful what you wish for.
You just might get it.

907
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:20,080
你沒問題吧?
What is your problem?

908
01:14:20,248 --> 01:14:24,084
是不是錯愛了某人什麼的?
Did you fall in love
with the wrong woman or something?

909
01:14:24,752 --> 01:14:26,253
打擾了 吉爾伯特小姐
Excuse me, Miss Gilbert.

910
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:28,588
你有電話
You have a phone call.

911
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,259
精神導師對你還好嗎?
How's the Guru Gita treating you?

912
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:36,096
不錯 你會喜歡上她的
Fine. You'd like her.

913
01:14:37,265 --> 01:14:39,683
收到郵件了嗎?
Did you get my e-mail?

914
01:14:40,393 --> 01:14:44,354
收到了 抱歉不能早點給你電話
Yeah. l'm sorry l didn't call sooner.

915
01:14:44,522 --> 01:14:45,939
為什麼?
Why didn't you?

916
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:47,440
因為如果我不回電...
Because if l didn't respond...

917
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:51,611
...我們之間還存在溝通解決問題的可能
我依然還有希望
...we were still having a conversation.
I was still in it.

918
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:57,993
抱歉 只是我們的時機不對
I'm sorry. We were just bad timing.

919
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:04,624
我只想事情變得簡單
那樣一來我倆的關係就會好好的
I just wanted things to be easy.
We were good when things were easy.

920
01:15:04,792 --> 01:15:09,129
不是說我現在不想要"簡單"點
只是不想逼得自己太"緊"
It's not that I need "easy" right now.
I just can't have "so hard."

921
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:12,507
聽起來你過得很好
Well, you sound good.

922
01:15:13,384 --> 01:15:14,801
變堅強了
Stronger.

923
01:15:15,011 --> 01:15:16,303
你也是
So do you.

924
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:19,639
我可是名演員 麗茲
Yeah, well, l'm an actor, Liz.

925
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:25,020
我得到了個角色
I got a part.

926
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:30,150
不是百老匯的 但也很不錯
It's off-Broadway,
but it's pretty cool.

927
01:15:30,318 --> 01:15:32,485
我為你感到高興
I'm happy for you.

928
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:36,156
好了
All right.

929
01:15:36,324 --> 01:15:38,825
那麼 日後再見吧
Well, l'll see you around, kid.

930
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:06,853
你好啊
Check you out.

931
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:10,065
從沒看過你如此聚精會神
I have never seen you so focused.

932
01:16:22,078 --> 01:16:23,203
你要來瓶"大拇指"
(印度知名可樂品牌 可口可樂公司出品)
You need a Thums Up.

933
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:29,876
不 嘴唇別碰到瓶子
No, no. No lips on the bottle.

934
01:16:30,086 --> 01:16:32,837
"除己之外 別碰任何東西"
印度第一準則
First rule in lndia is never
touch anything but yourself.

935
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:41,513
天 這口感 比可口可樂甜了5倍
Oh, good God. That's, like,
five times sweeter than Coke.

936
01:16:45,559 --> 01:16:48,395
我想這裏面或加了甲基苯丙胺
I think it might have
methamphetamines in it.

937
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:51,147
希望不是吧
We can only hope.

938
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:56,069
我知道你感覺糟透了
I know you feel awful.

939
01:16:57,571 --> 01:16:59,864
但你的生活正在發生變化
But your life's changing.

940
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:02,242
那不是壞事
That's not a bad thing.

941
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:06,037
你現又正處在極佳的地方
臣服在神的恩賜下
And you're in the perfect place for it.
Surrounded by grace.

942
01:17:06,997 --> 01:17:11,209
我本以為跟他的事結束了 但是...
I thought I was over him, but...

943
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:12,919
...我愛他
...l love him.

944
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:14,421
有什麼大不了
Big deal.

945
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:17,090
- 就是說你愛上了某人
- 我真的很想他
-So you fell in love with someone.
-l really miss him.

946
01:17:17,258 --> 01:17:18,758
那就去想吧
So miss him.

947
01:17:18,926 --> 01:17:22,637
每次想他時就給他送去點愛與光明
然後再把它們放下
Send him some light and love every
time you think of him, then drop it.

948
01:17:23,431 --> 01:17:27,183
如果能清空存於你腦海中...
You know, if you could clear out
all that space in your mind...

949
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:29,436
...用來迷戀這傢伙的...
...that you're using
to obsess over this guy...

950
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:32,939
...以及你那失敗婚姻的那些空間
你就能在門前騰出位置
...and your failed marriage,
you'd have a vacuum with a doorway.

951
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:36,276
知道茫茫宇宙能通過那門來幹什麼嗎?
(這裏的宇宙指人類無限的思維空間)
And you know what the universe
would do with that doorway?

952
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:40,947
上帝會由此處衝入
Rush in. God would rush in.

953
01:17:41,157 --> 01:17:46,286
為你注滿你沒奢望過的大量的愛
Fill you with more love
than you ever dreamed of. Man.

954
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:52,292
食品雜貨小姐
Groceries.

955
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:56,796
我想將來的某一天
你會擁有能容下整個世界的愛
I think you have the capacity someday
to love the whole world.

956
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:04,304
那邊在賣什麼?
What do they sell over there?

957
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:13,313
象鼻神 能為你掃清一切障礙
Ganesh. Remover of obstacles.

958
01:18:16,066 --> 01:18:17,859
我得需要很多這個
I'm gonna need a lot of these.

959
01:18:18,027 --> 01:18:22,655
說到大象 現正有一厲害角色來了這裏
Speaking of elephants, there's a rogue
elephant on the loose in the area.

960
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:24,324
他正在做巡演
He was with carnival.

961
01:18:24,492 --> 01:18:28,119
人們都說它高不可測
They say he is very,
very unpredictable and volatile.

962
01:18:28,287 --> 01:18:30,371
那只會讓她對其更著迷
That just makes him more attractive
to her.

963
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:33,500
你怎麼會這麼有才?
我想當中肯定經歷了艱辛吧
How'd you get to be so smart?
I'll bet it was the hard way.

964
01:18:33,667 --> 01:18:34,876
別轉話題
Don't change the subject.

965
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:39,756
天 什麼時候能跳過這些悲情的調子?
Well, when is this grieving phase
going to pass?

966
01:18:39,924 --> 01:18:42,258
你想要個確切的日子嗎?
You want a day on a calendar
you can circle?

967
01:18:42,426 --> 01:18:45,345
- 你能給我嗎?
- 不 你得去努力
-Can you give me one?
-No. You got to do the work.

968
01:18:45,513 --> 01:18:48,181
冥思 去做seva(服務)...
Meditate and go to seva...

969
01:18:48,349 --> 01:18:51,559
...最重要的是每天早上把屁股坐到坐墊上...
...and most important, get your butt
down to the Geet every morning...

970
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:53,019
...然後 事情自然會起變化
...and something'll change.

971
01:18:53,187 --> 01:18:57,190
我不能達到精神導師的境界
找到那種虔誠與奉獻的感覺
I just cannot get through the Guru Gita.
I can't find that feeling of devotion.

972
01:18:57,358 --> 01:19:01,444
虔誠在於愛 找個你想奉獻的人或事
Okay. Devotion's love. Pick somebody
or something you wanna devote it to.

973
01:19:01,612 --> 01:19:04,864
不一定要是精神導師 對她來說 那都一樣
It doesn't have to be the guru.
It's all the same to her.

974
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:07,242
跟你自己有關
This is about you.

975
01:19:08,786 --> 01:19:13,540
能否跟你說點事 食品雜貨小姐?
你有很嚴重的控制情結
Can l tell you something, Groceries?
You got some serious control issues.

976
01:19:13,707 --> 01:19:15,542
那麼明顯呀?
Is it obvious?

977
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:19,671
好了 理查 從我腦海裏出來吧
All right, Richard,
get out from inside my head now.

978
01:19:19,838 --> 01:19:20,880
把門關上
Shut the door.

979
01:19:23,342 --> 01:19:26,052
- 那就是他?
- 那就是他
-That's him?
-That's him.

980
01:19:26,554 --> 01:19:31,224
- 他很醜
- 才不 他很可愛
-He's hideous.
-No, he's not. He's cute.

981
01:19:31,392 --> 01:19:32,767
他是射手座
He's a Sagittarius.

982
01:19:33,394 --> 01:19:35,353
他在德里進修計算機編程
He studies computer programming
in Delhi.

983
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:37,355
成績很好
He has very good grades.

984
01:19:37,523 --> 01:19:40,900
家裏也很富有
And his family is very, very wealthy.

985
01:19:41,569 --> 01:19:46,906
他肯定是既自負又獨裁的人
He will be very conceited
and dictatorial.

986
01:19:48,075 --> 01:19:49,909
我的人生就終結在17歲了
My life is over at 1 7.

987
01:19:56,917 --> 01:19:58,793
圖絲
Tulsi.

988
01:22:34,908 --> 01:22:37,243
女士們 先生們 歡迎來到舞池...
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the dance floor...

989
01:22:37,411 --> 01:22:40,580
...現在有請麗茲和史蒂芬為各位
開始第一支舞
...for their very first couples dance,
Liz and Stephen.

990
01:22:53,093 --> 01:22:54,969
我的朋友們
My people.

991
01:22:55,596 --> 01:22:56,971
- 準備好了嗎?
- 準備好了
-Are you ready?

992
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:01,434
- 你看起來真漂亮
- 謝謝你
-You look beautiful.
-Thank you.

993
01:23:01,602 --> 01:23:03,936
我跟一位辣妹結婚了
I married a hottie.

994
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:09,358
- 這是什麼呀? 不是我們的曲子
- 不 確實不是
-What is that? That's not our song.
-No, it is not.

995
01:23:09,526 --> 01:23:11,110
親愛的 這不是我們的曲子呀
Baby, that's not our song.

996
01:23:11,278 --> 01:23:13,780
- 肯定不是
- 大家都在看著我們呢
-Definitely not.
-Everybody's looking at us.

997
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:17,241
沒關係 我去跟那個人說 沒事的
It's okay. I'm gonna go talk to the guy.
It's gonna be fine.

998
01:23:28,629 --> 01:23:31,088
- 我跟你說了我搞得定
- 你就是這麼搞定的啊?
-l told you l'd get it.
-This is taking care of it?

999
01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:33,150
我欠你一份結婚禮物
因為不知道送什麼好
I owe you a wedding gift.
I didn't know what was appropriate.

1000
01:24:35,696 --> 01:24:38,573
我想跟你說我已經...
I wanted to tell you l've been...

1001
01:24:38,949 --> 01:24:41,075
...打算把我的印度經典"古魯梵歌"
獻給你了
...dedicating my Guru Gita to you.

1002
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:46,873
想像你幸福的樣子
讓我領悟到梵歌的意義
Imagining you happy
is what got me through it.

1003
01:24:49,877 --> 01:24:52,044
我幸福的時候...
What did it look like...

1004
01:24:52,212 --> 01:24:54,380
...是什麼樣子?
...when I was happy?

1005
01:24:58,010 --> 01:25:01,304
我想像著你和瑞修...
I imagine you and Rijul...

1006
01:25:01,471 --> 01:25:04,473
...微笑著看著彼此...
...smiling and looking
at each other...

1007
01:25:05,392 --> 01:25:07,852
...眼神充滿愛和仁慈
...with love and kindness.

1008
01:25:08,645 --> 01:25:11,397
感覺十分真實
It seemed very real.

1009
01:25:13,817 --> 01:25:16,235
真的謝謝你 麗茲
Thank you so much, Liz.

1010
01:25:17,237 --> 01:25:20,197
我也會因此相信一切都會美好
That helps me to believe it as well.

1011
01:25:36,548 --> 01:25:38,925
在想你自己的婚禮嗎?
Thinking about your own wedding?

1012
01:25:39,676 --> 01:25:41,427
嗯 我也是
Yeah, me too.

1013
01:25:41,637 --> 01:25:45,431
婚禮最有意思的地方就在於
最後總會想到自己
The funny thing about weddings,
you end up thinking about yourself.

1014
01:25:46,308 --> 01:25:51,228
你給自己辦了一個盛大的舞會嗎?
那種大大軟軟的白色婚紗?
Did you throw yourself a big shindig?
Big, white, floppy dress?

1015
01:25:51,855 --> 01:25:57,610
是的 全都是我安排的
誰也沒強迫我做什麼
Yep. l arranged it all.
Nobody forced me into anything.

1016
01:25:57,778 --> 01:26:00,237
嗯 而你現在卻不能原諒自己
Yeah. And now
you can't forgive yourself.

1017
01:26:00,405 --> 01:26:04,784
說實話 我是在等他來原諒我
Honestly, I'm waiting for him
to forgive me.

1018
01:26:04,952 --> 01:26:06,452
讓我釋然
To release me.

1019
01:26:06,662 --> 01:26:09,747
等他原諒你就是浪費時間
浪費時間就是浪費生命 食品雜貨小姐
Waiting for him to forgive you
is a damn waste of time, Groceries.

1020
01:26:09,915 --> 01:26:11,791
原諒你自己吧
Forgive yourself.

1021
01:26:13,085 --> 01:26:15,294
不是那麼簡單的
It's not that easy.

1022
01:26:16,630 --> 01:26:18,130
是啊
Yeah.

1023
01:26:33,814 --> 01:26:35,106
晚安 理查
Good night, Richard.

1024
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,775
- 跟我來吧
- 我累了
-Follow me.
-l'm tired.

1025
01:26:38,151 --> 01:26:39,443
趕緊過來
Get your butt up here.

1026
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:08,848
雖然不是個好故事...
It's not a pretty story...

1027
01:27:09,808 --> 01:27:11,976
...但是相當典型
...but it's pretty classic.

1028
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:18,149
大量的酗酒 吸毒 還有無心的欺騙
Too much alcohol, too many drugs,
too much mindless cheating.

1029
01:27:19,943 --> 01:27:21,819
遺憾而已
Just regret.

1030
01:27:24,448 --> 01:27:26,699
傷逝成海 追悔莫及
Ocean of regret.

1031
01:27:29,036 --> 01:27:31,370
我失去了一切
I lost everything.

1032
01:27:32,122 --> 01:27:34,540
我的自尊 我的工作
My pride, my job.

1033
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:37,209
我的家庭
My family.

1034
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:42,006
我失去了我的家人
I lost my family.

1035
01:27:53,894 --> 01:27:58,397
有一天下班之後 我在酒吧駐足
喝得爛醉
One day after work, l stopped off
at a bar and I got shitfaced.

1036
01:27:59,066 --> 01:28:01,484
那時的我和你很像
I was a lot like you, you know.

1037
01:28:01,651 --> 01:28:05,237
我只是... 我不知道
我想太多 我感覺太....
I was just-- I don't know.
I thought too much, I felt too....

1038
01:28:06,782 --> 01:28:09,283
我希望自己是麻木的
I wanted to feel nothing.

1039
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:14,205
我本來可以叫輛出租車 但沒有
I should've called a cab, but I didn't.

1040
01:28:14,372 --> 01:28:17,625
我鑽進車裏 開回家
I just got in my car
and l drove home.

1041
01:28:21,588 --> 01:28:23,506
我的兒子
My little boy....

1042
01:28:28,512 --> 01:28:31,555
那時候他才8歲 他在...
He was 8 years old at the time.
He was pl--

1043
01:28:36,228 --> 01:28:41,190
他在坐在車道上玩著汽車模型
等著他那失敗又...
He was sitting in the driveway with his
little Hot Wheels, waiting for his lost...

1044
01:28:41,358 --> 01:28:43,776
窮困的酒鬼老爸...
...drunk, miserable dad...

1045
01:28:44,945 --> 01:28:47,738
...回家跟他玩
...to come home and play with him.

1046
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:51,325
我沒看見他
I didn't see him.

1047
01:28:52,244 --> 01:28:57,623
我沒看見 我只是把車開到車道上
卻沒看見我的兒子
I didn't. I just roared into that driveway
and l didn't see my little boy.

1048
01:28:59,084 --> 01:29:01,710
但他...不 他....
But he-- No, he....

1049
01:29:03,130 --> 01:29:05,256
他閃開了
He got out of the way.

1050
01:29:09,970 --> 01:29:12,888
當我在車道附近 他都知道要躲遠一點
He was used to getting out of the way
when I was around.

1051
01:29:14,224 --> 01:29:15,933
而我卻...卻...
And l-- You know, I don't--

1052
01:29:16,101 --> 01:29:17,893
什麼都不記得了
I don't know.
I don't remember a thing.

1053
01:29:18,061 --> 01:29:20,771
隔天我醒來 他們已經走了
Next day, l woke up
and they were gone.

1054
01:29:22,399 --> 01:29:27,319
我妻子從窗子看著發生的一切
My wife had been watching
what happened out the window.

1055
01:29:28,155 --> 01:29:29,989
她再也不....
She just wasn't gonna....

1056
01:29:31,825 --> 01:29:34,368
她再也不想過這樣的生活
She just wasn't gonna
do it anymore.

1057
01:29:35,495 --> 01:29:37,163
所以....
So....

1058
01:29:41,835 --> 01:29:43,586
他現在18歲了
He's 1 8 now.

1059
01:29:43,753 --> 01:29:47,381
他在上學 而且 特別聰明
He's in school and,
oh, God, he's so smart.

1060
01:29:52,637 --> 01:29:55,639
上帝啊 他那麼討人喜歡而且....
God, he's so funny and he's....

1061
01:29:58,185 --> 01:30:00,186
那麼窩心
He's so sweet.

1062
01:30:06,526 --> 01:30:08,444
我卻錯過這一切
I missed it all.

1063
01:30:08,612 --> 01:30:10,487
我錯過了...
I missed...

1064
01:30:12,365 --> 01:30:15,784
...兒子成長的過程 我也錯過了
...my son's growing up. Just missed it.

1065
01:30:28,798 --> 01:30:30,549
你了解嗎?
Okay?

1066
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:34,720
來
Come here.

1067
01:30:42,729 --> 01:30:43,729
這事兒這麼辦
Here's the deal.

1068
01:30:44,564 --> 01:30:47,399
在你原諒自己之前 就先在這呆著
You're gonna stay here
till you forgive yourself.

1069
01:30:47,567 --> 01:30:49,443
聽見沒有?
You hear me?

1070
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:53,447
其它一切事兒都自有安排
Everything else
will take care of itself.

1071
01:30:54,741 --> 01:30:57,576
你就是在這兒自我原諒的?
Is this where you forgave yourself?

1072
01:31:00,914 --> 01:31:03,582
我在盡力而為 伊莉莎白
I'm trying, Elizabeth.

1073
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:05,960
我在盡力而為
I am trying.

1074
01:31:54,634 --> 01:31:56,218
嘿
Hey.

1075
01:31:58,888 --> 01:32:02,808
我敢說這就是
我們婚禮上本應演奏的曲子
I believe this is the song they were
supposed to play at our wedding.

1076
01:32:39,262 --> 01:32:41,805
我的確愛過你 史蒂芬
I did love you, Stephen.

1077
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:50,356
我知道
I know.

1078
01:32:52,817 --> 01:32:55,319
但我還是很愛你
But l still love you.

1079
01:33:04,704 --> 01:33:06,789
那就愛我吧
So love me.

1080
01:33:12,379 --> 01:33:14,546
但我思念你
But l miss you.

1081
01:33:18,009 --> 01:33:20,302
那就思念吧
So miss me.

1082
01:33:21,304 --> 01:33:25,641
每當想起我的時候
就用愛和光芒來潤澤我...
Send me love and light
every time you think of me...

1083
01:33:25,809 --> 01:33:27,059
...再黯然熄滅
...then drop it.

1084
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:48,205
不會永遠的
It won't last forever.

1085
01:33:49,874 --> 01:33:52,000
沒有永遠
Nothing does.

1086
01:34:11,312 --> 01:34:13,397
- 拜拜
- 再見 理查先生
-Bye-bye.
-Goodbye, Mr. Richard.

1087
01:34:13,565 --> 01:34:15,441
我們再會
I'll see you.

1088
01:34:16,317 --> 01:34:19,778
你要走了的話
每天誰還來給我當頭棒喝呢?
Now that you're going,
who is gonna kick my ass every day?

1089
01:34:19,946 --> 01:34:23,782
噢 直到雨季讓我不得不離開之前
我都盡量一直在這兒了 拜拜
Oh, l'd stay till a monsoon
swept me away if I could. Bye-bye.

1090
01:34:23,950 --> 01:34:26,201
但是你還得付賬單 還得蓋房子
But you've got bills to pay
and houses to build.

1091
01:34:26,369 --> 01:34:29,455
你就繼續做事 過日子 成麼?
You just keep doing the work
and move on with your life, will you?

1092
01:34:29,622 --> 01:34:32,291
你這人都要上飛機了
卻還在對我指手畫腳
The man is getting on a plane
and you're still bossing me.

1093
01:34:32,459 --> 01:34:37,921
你說的我都記下來了: 接著過日子
看到不順眼的去向真主禱告...
I've got your whole list: move on,
use mosquito repellent and....

1094
01:34:38,089 --> 01:34:41,258
我不知道 還有些別的事兒
我都寫下來
I don't know. There were some
other things. I wrote them down.

1095
01:34:45,889 --> 01:34:48,599
回德克薩斯去吧 理查
Go back to Texas, Richard.

1096
01:34:57,567 --> 01:35:00,486
這已經是我在這兒的極限了
Well, l ain't getting
any prettier standing here.

1097
01:35:02,906 --> 01:35:04,114
所以我準備走了
So l'm off.

1098
01:35:14,167 --> 01:35:16,126
嘿 食品雜貨小姐
Hey, Groceries.

1099
01:35:16,628 --> 01:35:17,836
再次相信愛情吧
Believe in love again.

1100
01:35:41,736 --> 01:35:44,196
麗茲 麗茲 我今天把標識摘下來了
Liz. Liz, l've just taken
my badge off today.

1101
01:35:44,364 --> 01:35:47,366
我做得真不賴啊
四個星期一聲不吭 真累啊
I've done so well.
Four weeks of silence. lt was so dull.

1102
01:35:47,534 --> 01:35:49,910
但是這就像做了個整容
因為你的臉...
But it's like a facelift
because your face...

1103
01:35:50,078 --> 01:35:54,790
...那個 放鬆之後 你的喉嚨就會下垂
就是這麼回事兒
...you know, just relaxes and your
throat just drops down. It's a bargain.

1104
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:56,542
我們有好多好多要補聊的
We've got so much to catch up on.

1105
01:35:59,796 --> 01:36:05,342
噢 沒事 對你有好處
你會受益良多的
Oh, golly. Good for you.
You will get so much out of that.

1106
01:36:05,885 --> 01:36:09,346
你的嗓音也會清澈無比
And your throat will look amazing
as well.

1107
01:36:13,309 --> 01:36:14,518
抱歉 伊莉莎白
Excuse me, Elizabeth.

1108
01:36:14,686 --> 01:36:17,563
他們要你在晚飯之後
到互助者辦公室報到...
They're asking you to report
to the seva office after dinner...

1109
01:36:17,772 --> 01:36:19,064
...如果你不介意的話
...if you don't mind.

1110
01:36:19,691 --> 01:36:22,067
我們準備讓你不再擦洗地板了
We're taking you off
the floor-scrubbing team.

1111
01:36:22,277 --> 01:36:25,737
明天會從世界各地
來50個左右的志願者...
There are about 50 devotees arriving
tomorrow from all over the world...

1112
01:36:25,905 --> 01:36:29,408
...隱居大概10天 我們打算讓你來
讓你當女主持
...for a 1 0-day retreat and we'd
like you to be the key hostess.

1113
01:36:29,909 --> 01:36:33,078
我們想請你就不要去參加冥想了
We ask that you don't take part
during the meditations.

1114
01:36:33,288 --> 01:36:38,083
我們需要你照顧來賓
確保每個人都賓至如歸
We need you to watch over the flock,
make sure everyone is all right.

1115
01:36:38,418 --> 01:36:42,379
我們管這職位的人叫小小乳酪奶油小姐
We call the person who does
this job Little Suzy Cream Cheese.

1116
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:47,092
你得八面玲瓏 長袖善舞
還要一直微笑
You need to be social and bubbly
and smiling all the time.

1117
01:36:50,597 --> 01:36:52,431
女士...
Madam...

1118
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:54,933
...我就是妳要找的人
...l'm your girl.

1119
01:37:10,116 --> 01:37:12,951
那就去找一下你的箱子吧
應該就在這兒附近的...
So just find your suitcase,
it should be here somewhere...

1120
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:15,329
...然後就趕緊回房間
...and then head down the path
to your room.

1121
01:37:16,372 --> 01:37:21,835
這樣的話 印度大冒險的千言萬語
可以匯成一句話
So the holy truth of the whole
adventure here in India is in one line:

1122
01:37:22,211 --> 01:37:25,714
神與汝共鳴 神與汝同在
God dwells within you as you.

1123
01:37:25,882 --> 01:37:28,133
上帝對看那些善男信女們的...
God's not interested
in watching a performance...

1124
01:37:28,343 --> 01:37:30,636
...所作所為可不感興趣
...of how a spiritual person
looks and behaves.

1125
01:37:30,803 --> 01:37:33,722
安靜的女孩兒 悄無聲息地飄過...
The quiet girl who glides silently

That's lngrid Bergman
in The Bells of St. Mary's, not me.

1128
01:37:42,357 --> 01:37:46,652
神與我共鳴 神與我同在
God dwells within me as me.

1129
01:38:55,930 --> 01:38:58,223
被惡魔摧殘的孩子啊
Child tormented by demon.

1130

Same thing.

-Oh, good.
-You sad girl from New York.

1146
01:40:06,292 --> 01:40:08,919
- 沒錯

1149
01:40:12,715 --> 01:40:14,633
我們好久不見
So long ago we meet.

1150
01:40:14,801 --> 01:40:19,971
上一次見你 你那麼憂心忡忡
那麼情緒低落
Last time, you have too much worry,
too much sorrow.

1151
01:40:20,139 --> 01:40:23,099
上次見你 你就像個
一臉愁苦的老太太
Last time,
you look like sad old woman.

1152
01:40:24,227 --> 01:40:26,895
現在你可真漂亮

...因為很多事情啦 真的
...a lot of things, really.

1155
01:40:32,151 --> 01:40:34,986
不過我在羅馬待了四個月大吃大喝
But l was in Rome for four months,
just feeding myself...

1156
01:40:35,154 --> 01:40:37,614
...後來我去了印度的一座佛祠
...and then I went to live
at an ashram in lndia.

1157
01:40:37,782 --> 01:40:40,158
而今我們相聚了
Now, we put together.

1158
01:40:40,326 --> 01:40:41,827
沒錯 我就是為了這個來的
Exactly. That's why l'm here.

1159

- 科圖很願意這樣

你還想讓我幫你學英語嗎?
Do you still want me to help you
with your English?

1161
01:40:50,503 --> 01:40:52,629
回頭再說英語的事兒 麗茲
English later, Liss.

1162
01:40:52,797 --> 01:40:56,007
首先 一個更好的主意
First, better idea.

1163
01:41:00,471 --> 01:41:02,514
這些都有多少年月了?
How old are these?

1164
01:41:02,682 --> 01:41:05,350
從祖父那一輩就有了
非常重要的法術
From grandfather.
Very important spells.

1165
01:41:05,518 --> 01:41:08,019
還有符咒和藥劑
Also mantras, cures.

1166
01:41:08,187 --> 01:41:10,438
一千多年了
Thousand years' worth.

1167
01:41:10,606 --> 01:41:14,150
我擁有的一切 我知道的一切
全在這兒了
All I have, all l know, right here.

1168
01:41:14,318 --> 01:41:15,485
能給我抄一份兒嗎?
You copy for me?

1169
01:41:15,653 --> 01:41:17,696
沒問題 我去城裏把這些拿...
Absolutely. l can go to town
and take these--

1170
01:41:17,864 --> 01:41:19,698
不 你不能拿走
No. You don't take.

1171
01:41:22,952 --> 01:41:25,370
你就抄在這兒 這樣更好 麗茲
You copy here, better, Liss.

1172
01:41:25,538 --> 01:41:28,081
我得打個盹兒 我年紀大了
I take a nap now. l very old.

1173
01:41:30,209 --> 01:41:31,543
你多大年紀了 科圖?
How old are you, Ketut?

1174
01:41:31,711 --> 01:41:33,336
一百零一歲了...
One hundred and one...

1175
01:41:33,504 --> 01:41:36,715
...或者也有可能是六十四歲
...or maybe 64.

1176
01:41:36,883 --> 01:41:39,217
不記得了
Don't remember.

1177
01:41:47,226 --> 01:41:49,394
我後半輩子就全花在這上了
This is gonna take me
the rest of my life.

1178
01:41:49,562 --> 01:41:53,231
他使你漂亮 為你找個愛人
你為他努力工作
He make you pretty, find you husband,
you work hard for him.

1179
01:41:53,399 --> 01:41:55,525
這跟我來這兒的原因正相反
That's exactly opposite
of why l'm here.

1180
01:41:55,693 --> 01:41:58,111
誰都得找個愛人啊
Everybody need husband.

1181
01:42:04,118 --> 01:42:05,744
能麻煩你給我拿點兒水嗎?
Would you mind getting me water?

1182
01:42:05,912 --> 01:42:07,412
我不去
No.

1183
01:42:07,622 --> 01:42:12,250
好吧 接著抄 我去拿水
Fine. Keep making copies.
I get water.

1184
01:42:26,098 --> 01:42:29,434
麗茲 巴里島人相信巴里島就是宇宙的中心
So, Liz, the Balinese believe
that Bali's the center of the universe.

1185
01:42:29,602 --> 01:42:31,269
而我們現在就在巴里島的中心
And here we are
in the center of Bali.

1186
01:42:31,437 --> 01:42:33,772
你有個臥室 有個釣魚池
You got the one bedroom,
got your fish pond.

1187
01:42:33,940 --> 01:42:35,649
你有自己的廟宇 可以冥想
You got your own meditation temple.

1188
01:42:35,942 --> 01:42:38,568
我跟你說啊 在炸彈事件之後
遊客是一天比一天少...
I tell you, since the bombing,
tourism's been way down...

1189
01:42:38,736 --> 01:42:42,197
...所以我可以開一個非常非常優惠
的價錢租給你這個地方
...so l can give you this place
at a very, very good price right now.

1190
01:42:42,365 --> 01:42:44,282
天堂

1191
01:42:47,036 --> 01:42:49,245
- 我就要它了
- 巴里島的人們明白...
-l'll take it.
-People in Bali understand...

1192
01:42:49,413 --> 01:42:52,457
...為了快樂常在 就要時時刻刻...
...in order to stay happy,
must always know where you are...

1193
01:42:52,667 --> 01:42:54,125
...領悟自己所處之境
...every moment.

1194
01:42:54,293 --> 01:42:58,922
這兒就是完美的平衡
天與地恰巧於此交匯
Right here is perfect balance.
Right at meeting of heaven and earth.

1195
01:43:00,132 --> 01:43:02,884
沒那麼多的高風亮節
沒那麼多的爾虞我詐
Not too much God,
not too much selfish.

1196
01:43:03,052 --> 01:43:06,137
否則的話 生活就太瘋狂了
Otherwise, life too crazy.

1197
01:43:06,305 --> 01:43:09,766
失去了平衡就失去了力量
You lose balance, you lose power.

1198
01:43:09,934 --> 01:43:13,311
早上起來 你做印度式的冥想
In morning,
you do meditation from India.

1199
01:43:13,813 --> 01:43:15,814
認真 要非常認真
Serious. Very serious.

1200
01:43:15,982 --> 01:43:18,108
白天呢 就要享受巴里島
In day, you enjoy Bali.

1201
01:43:27,994 --> 01:43:30,996
下午的話 就來找我
Then in afternoon, come see me.

1202
01:43:38,212 --> 01:43:40,964
一天將盡之時 你還要再次冥想
End of day, you do new meditation.

1203
01:43:41,132 --> 01:43:42,173
很簡單
Very simple.

1204
01:43:42,341 --> 01:43:46,011
靜坐 微笑
Sit in silence and smile.

1205
01:43:47,263 --> 01:43:48,638
我已經感覺到平衡了
I feel balanced already.

1206
01:43:48,806 --> 01:43:50,181
沒這麼簡單 麗茲
Not so easy, Liss.

1207
01:43:50,349 --> 01:43:55,020
臉上要笑 心裏更要笑
Smile with face. Smile with mind.

1208
01:43:55,229 --> 01:43:58,231
甚至連肝臟都要有微笑
Even smile in liver.

1209
01:44:00,151 --> 01:44:02,527
回頭見 小鱷魚
See you later, alligator.

1210
01:45:15,434 --> 01:45:17,060
噢 天啊
Oh, God.

1211
01:45:17,228 --> 01:45:19,437
- 你還好吧?
- 你瞎了嗎?
-Are you all right?
-Are you blind?

1212
01:45:19,605 --> 01:45:24,442
- 請讓我帶你去看醫生吧
- 我沒事兒 我只是...
-Please, let me take you to a doctor.
-l'm fine. l just--

1213
01:45:28,114 --> 01:45:29,781

It looks bad.

1214
01:45:29,949 --> 01:45:31,616
很不好 麗茲
Very bad, Liss.

男人? 有錢嗎?
A man? He rich?

1217
01:45:38,290 --> 01:45:39,749
這很嚴重啊
This very hot.

- 有你啊 你不就是個配藥方的人嗎
-You need healer.

- 是的
-No. You need Wayan.
-Yeah.

1220
01:45:57,017 --> 01:46:00,645
這是加姆藥草 把這個喝了
比抗生素還管用
Jamu. Drink this.
Better than antibiotic.

1221
01:46:06,986 --> 01:46:08,945
她也讓你喝這個嗎?
She make you drink this?

1222
01:46:09,113 --> 01:46:11,156

1226
01:46:24,837 --> 01:46:26,754
好吧 有那麼一次...
Okay, well,

1227

我離過婚的時候 他們都大惑不解
...but l find when l tell people in Bali

結果就撞到你了
And l leaned over to fix it

01:56:27,522 --> 01:56:28,898
真狡猾
Subtle.

1379
01:56:29,775 --> 01:56:32,276
你去巴里島之前一直住在巴西嗎?
Did you always live in Brazil
before you came to Bali?

1380
01:56:32,486 --> 01:56:33,778
沒有啦 住了20年而已
No, no. Only for 20 years.

1381
01:56:33,945 --> 01:56:38,199
然後我認識了我的太太
和她一起搬去了澳大利亞
Then l met my wife
and l moved with her to Australia.

1382
01:56:38,366 --> 01:56:41,410
她因為工作的緣故四處遊走
She traveled a lot
because of the job.

1383
01:56:41,578 --> 01:56:45,122
- 我就在家帶孩子
- 男女平等的好老公
-And I stayed home with the children.
-A good feminist husband.

1384
01:56:45,290 --> 01:56:48,793
對啊 可惜這不是她想要的
Yeah. Yeah. Didn't turn out to be
what she wanted, l'm afraid.

1385
01:56:49,002 --> 01:56:50,461
- 怎麼了?
- 怎麼了?
-What happened?
-What happened?

1386
01:56:50,629 --> 01:56:51,962
孩子長大了
Well, the children were grown.

1387
01:56:52,130 --> 01:56:57,802
我做起珠寶進出口的生意
所以我想住哪都行
And l run an import-export jewelry
business, so I could live anywhere.

1388
01:56:58,011 --> 01:57:02,807
巴里島看起來是個
讓人走出離婚陰影的聖地
And Bali seemed like the perfect place
to recover from a divorce.

1389
01:57:04,935 --> 01:57:07,937
我就來了 來到這裏 就是這樣
And here l am. Here l am.

1390
01:57:08,104 --> 01:57:09,772
- 你呢?
- 沒你那麼悲啦
-And you?
-Well, far less tragic.

1391
01:57:09,940 --> 01:57:15,486
我們都不成熟 結婚太早 於是分開了
We were immature and really too
young to get married. We grew apart.

1392
01:57:15,654 --> 01:57:17,154
你們都很心碎
Hearts were broken.

1393
01:57:17,781 --> 01:57:19,657
是的
Yes.

1394
01:57:19,825 --> 01:57:21,909
那我們都一樣
Then it's the same.

1395
01:57:27,541 --> 01:57:28,958
這太完美啦
This is just perfect.

1396
01:57:29,543 --> 01:57:31,418
你也是
So are you.

1397
01:57:31,586 --> 01:57:34,463
知道你怎樣嗎 你是假瘦
You know what you are?
You're a falsa magra.

1398
01:57:34,631 --> 01:57:36,507
- 知不知道什麼意思?
- 什麼?
-You know what that is?
-What?

1399
01:57:36,675 --> 01:57:40,177
遠看苗條優雅
You are slender and elegant
in a distance...

1400
01:57:40,345 --> 01:57:43,848
近看卻圓潤豐腴
...but up close,
you are round and fleshy.

1401
01:57:45,517 --> 01:57:47,560
巴西人太可愛了
Thank God for Brazilians.

1402
01:57:51,481 --> 01:57:53,357
別這樣!
Stop that!

1403
01:57:59,614 --> 01:58:01,699
你是世界旅行者
You are a world traveler.

1404
01:58:01,867 --> 01:58:03,200
他見誰都這樣說
He says that to everyone.

1405
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:05,494
已經賺到了錢
Already make your money.

1406
01:58:06,329 --> 01:58:09,331
你缺乏年輕人的勃勃雄心
You don't have young-man ambition.

1407
01:58:10,166 --> 01:58:14,503
- 他好厲害
- 你有三個小孩
-He's good.
-You have three children.

1408
01:58:14,671 --> 01:58:16,881
兩個啦 那是個老繭
Two. That's a callous.

1409
01:58:19,509 --> 01:58:20,843
你離婚了
And you have divorce.

1410
01:58:22,095 --> 01:58:23,345
很不好受
Very difficult.

1411
01:58:23,513 --> 01:58:26,515
你很愛她
You loved her very much.

1412
01:58:27,559 --> 01:58:29,101
你的傷還沒痊癒
You haven't healed that wound.

1413
01:58:29,895 --> 01:58:34,106
現在你不敢打開心扉
Now you are scared
to open your heart.

1414
01:58:35,066 --> 01:58:38,402
害怕再次受傷
You are afraid
hurt will happen to you again.

1415
01:58:39,112 --> 01:58:41,030
療傷的唯一關鍵
Only way to heal...

1416
01:58:41,197 --> 01:58:43,741
在於信任
...is to trust.

1417
01:58:45,619 --> 01:58:49,872
沒關係的 曾經心碎意味著你曾付出
This okay. To have broken heart
mean you have tried for something.

1418
01:58:53,960 --> 01:58:57,087
我的心 還會再碎一次嗎?
Is it going to be broken again?

1419
01:58:57,255 --> 01:58:59,423
麗茲 他是個好男人 你需要好男人
He a good man, Liz.
You need a good man.

1420
01:59:01,927 --> 01:59:03,594
謝謝
Thank you.

1421
01:59:03,762 --> 01:59:06,347
真的 科圖知道的
True. Ketut knows.

1422
01:59:10,685 --> 01:59:13,562
誰都說我需要個男人 聽的都煩了
I am so sick of people telling me
I need a man.

1423
01:59:13,730 --> 01:59:17,775
麗茲 你不需要男人
你需要王者
You don't need a man, Liz.
You need a champion.

1424
01:59:23,782 --> 01:59:27,117
- 放春假了吧?
- 快點啦 你們跟烏龜似的
-Some spring break, huh?
-Come on. You're moving like turtles.

1425
01:59:27,285 --> 01:59:28,953
他的熱情快要耗盡了
His enthusiasm is exhausting.

1426
01:59:29,120 --> 01:59:31,455
十歲時他送我去學校...
Try being dropped off at school
when you're 10...

1427
01:59:31,623 --> 01:59:33,791
吻別還要親嘴
...and having your father
kiss you on the mouth.

1428
01:59:33,959 --> 01:59:35,542
到現在還這樣
He still does it.

1429
01:59:35,710 --> 01:59:39,421
我知道在巴西這很平常
可我又不是在巴西長大的
I'm sure it's all normal in Brazil,
but I didn't grow up in Brazil.

1430
01:59:39,589 --> 01:59:41,382
我都被朋友們笑死了
Friends would tease
the crap out of me.

1431
01:59:41,549 --> 01:59:43,050
那你怎麼不叫他別這樣呢?
Why didn't you ask him to stop?

1432
01:59:43,218 --> 01:59:45,678
算了 一開始我說了 然後我意識到
No, I did at first,
but then l realized...

1433
01:59:45,845 --> 01:59:48,639
我放棄堅持 他就高興的很
...how happy it made the old guy
and l just gave in.

1434
01:59:48,807 --> 01:59:53,602
知道嗎 我奶奶比你們走得都快呢
You know what? My grandmother
hikes faster than you both...

1435
01:59:53,770 --> 01:59:56,230
可她早就去世了
...but she's already dead.

1436
01:59:56,398 --> 01:59:59,149
揍他 去揍他
Get him. Go get him.

1437
01:59:59,317 --> 02:00:02,486
不如你來背一會兒背包吧?
How about you carry the packs
for a while, eh?

1438
02:00:02,737 --> 02:00:05,280
過來這裏 你們看
Come here. Look at this.

1439
02:00:05,657 --> 02:00:07,574
很漂亮吧?
Is it nice?

1440
02:00:08,118 --> 02:00:09,159
寶貝
Baby.

1441
02:00:10,161 --> 02:00:12,246
我殿後了
Bringing up the rear.

1442
02:00:22,007 --> 02:00:24,758
- 你和她上床了嗎?
- 什麼意思?
-So have you slept with her yet?
-What was that?

1443
02:00:24,926 --> 02:00:26,301
你和她上床了嗎?
Have you slept with her yet?

1444
02:00:26,469 --> 02:00:28,178
你問得過分了
Crossing the line.

1445
02:00:28,346 --> 02:00:32,141
老爸 都十年了 是時候了
Dad, it's been 10 years. lt's time.

1446
02:00:44,612 --> 02:00:46,989
避開漂亮的女人
Stay away from
all the beautiful girls.

1447
02:00:47,157 --> 02:00:49,533
他們很危險的
They are dangerous.

1448
02:00:54,372 --> 02:00:56,123
- 一個星期太短了
- 對
-A week is too short.

1449
02:00:56,291 --> 02:00:59,209

- 對
-A week is too short.
-Yup.

1450

我幫你做了個合輯

1451
02:01:03,882 --> 02:01:06,383
作為禮物送給你

謝謝
Thank you.

1453
02:01:09,929 --> 02:01:12,723
我已經開始想你了
I'm missing you already.

1454
02:01:20,565 --> 02:01:22,316
再見 麗茲

1455
02:01:24,569 --> 02:01:27,029
- 小心的
- 你也是

1456
02:01:29,532 --> 02:01:31,075
怎麼不親我了?
So don't I get a kiss?

1457
02:01:31,284 --> 02:01:33,077
不知道

1459
02:01:52,430 --> 02:01:55,099
很傻 我知道
So stupid, I know.

1460

他19歲了 有男子氣概了
He's 19 years old
and he's such a man.

1461
02:02:02,398 --> 02:02:04,233
很貼心
It's sweet.

1462
02:02:04,567 --> 02:02:06,443
你很貼心
You're sweet.

1463
02:03:40,705 --> 02:03:42,497
親愛的

1466
02:04:38,721 --> 02:04:42,099
麗茲 過來 我得告訴你一些事
Liz. Come here.
I have to tell you something.

1467
02:04:48,273 --> 02:04:50,941
不 我真的要冥想了
No. I should really,
really be meditating.

1468

去吧 去冥想
Go, go. Do it.

1469
02:05:00,994 --> 02:05:03,412
我已經兩個星期沒去見科圖了
You know, I have not been
to see Ketut in two weeks.

1470
02:05:03,579 --> 02:05:04,621
- 真的?
- 真的
-Really?
-Yes.

1471
02:05:04,789 --> 02:05:06,999
- 好的 去吧
- 好
-Okay. Go, go.
-Okay.

1472
02:05:10,378 --> 02:05:14,298
天哪 可是你比科圖可愛多了
Oh, gosh. But you are just
so much cuter than Ketut.

1473
02:05:17,135 --> 02:05:21,305
別 我得走了 我得走了

1474
02:05:28,479 --> 02:05:30,272
為什麼?
Why?

1475
02:05:42,535 --> 02:05:44,953
你膀胱感染了
You have bladder infection.

1476
02:05:45,121 --> 02:05:49,666
通常是因為一段日子沒做愛
接著又性愛過度
Common after no sex,
then too much sexy time.

1477
02:05:49,834 --> 02:05:53,420
我們這兩星期來 一分鐘都沒分開過
We haven't even been apart
for a minute in two weeks.

1478
02:05:58,760 --> 02:06:01,178
你害怕了 是吧?
You're afraid now, right?

1479
02:06:01,346 --> 02:06:02,679
我懂
I understand.

1480
02:06:02,847 --> 02:06:04,973
你不想失去自我
You don't want to lose yourself.

1481
02:06:05,350 --> 02:06:08,518
愛情令人恐懼 危險重重
Love is scary, dangerous.

1482
02:06:08,686 --> 02:06:10,187
我曾經歷過
Happen to me.

02:06:11,522 --> 02:06:15,192
我每天都在祈禱 丈夫卻對我不好
I pray every day,
but husband bad for me.

1484
02:06:15,693 --> 02:06:17,569
我要離開他
I have to get away from him.

1485
02:06:18,863 --> 02:06:22,157
他打我這兒
This from where he hit me...

1486
02:06:22,325 --> 02:06:23,867
用摩托頭盔打我
...with motorcycle helmet.

1487
02:06:24,869 --> 02:06:27,162
然後我的女兒
And then my daughter...

1488
02:06:28,039 --> 02:06:30,165
求我離開他
...she begged me to leave him.

1489
02:06:30,333 --> 02:06:31,875
對嗎 親愛的?

1490
02:06:32,085 --> 02:06:34,878
我說 媽咪 我認為你應該離婚
I said, "I think you should
get a divorce, Mommy."

1491
02:06:35,088 --> 02:06:38,673
她說那話的時候才四歲
She was 4 years old
when she said it.

1492
02:06:43,846 --> 02:06:46,807
不要討厭菲利培
Don't feel bad about Felipe.

1493
02:06:46,974 --> 02:06:49,559
誰都渴望愛 親愛的
Everybody needs affection, honey.

1494
02:06:49,727 --> 02:06:51,728
愛讓人們舉止幼稚
Make people do funny things.

1495
02:06:51,896 --> 02:06:55,232
在一段感情開始的時候
人人都會這樣的
Everyone gets like that
at beginning of relationship.

1496
02:06:55,400 --> 02:06:59,027
奢望太多的快樂 太多的歡愉
Want too much happiness,
too much pleasure...

1497
02:06:59,195 --> 02:07:02,197
直到自己厭倦
...until make yourself sick.

1498
02:07:02,615 --> 02:07:06,910
我的感情初始之際
我 懷恩 也有這樣的感覺
Even to Wayan, this happen

1499
02:07:07,120 --> 02:07:09,913

慶祝方式是
A cheaper, more lovely way

1508
02:07:33,771 --> 02:07:36,523
一無所有的女人 連孩子都失去了
...a woman gets nothing,
not even her children.

1509
02:07:36,691 --> 02:07:40,735
為了得到她女兒圖蒂的監護權
懷恩變賣了所有的家當
To gain custody of her daughter, Tutti,
Wayan had to sell everything...

1510
02:07:40,903 --> 02:07:43,447
連浴室的腳墊都賣了
只為支付律師費
...even her bath mat,
to pay for a lawyer.

1511
02:07:44,449 --> 02:07:46,450
幾年來 她們不停的搬遷
For years,
they've moved from place to place.

1512
02:07:46,659 --> 02:07:50,287
每搬一次懷恩都會失去客戶
圖蒂不得不轉學
Each time, Wayan loses clientele
and Tutti has to change schools.

1513
02:07:51,205 --> 02:07:55,125
巴里島的這一小撮人成了我的家人
This little group of people in Bali
have become my family.

1514
02:07:55,293 --> 02:07:58,795
不論在哪裏和家人相遇
我們都要照顧他們
And we must take care of our
families, wherever we find them.

1515
02:07:58,963 --> 02:08:02,299
今天我看到圖蒂在玩
馬路上撿到的一塊藍色磁磚...
Today l saw Tutti playing with
a blue tile she'd found in the road...

1516
02:08:02,467 --> 02:08:05,135
...在一棟旅館興建工地附近撿到的
她和我說
...near a hotel construction site.
She told me:

1517
02:08:05,303 --> 02:08:07,971
或許某天我們會有個家
Maybe if we have
a house someday...

1518
02:08:08,181 --> 02:08:10,974
家裏鋪著這種漂亮的藍色地板
...it can have a pretty blue floor
like this.

1519
02:08:11,809 --> 02:08:13,602
我在意大利的時候 學到一個詞
When I was in Italy,
I learned a word--

1520
02:08:13,769 --> 02:08:15,020
是"圖蒂" 有兩個T
It's "tutti" with double T.

1521
02:08:15,980 --> 02:08:20,442
意大利語意思是"每個人"
這是我學到的一課
--which in ltalian means "everybody."
So that's the lesson, isn't it?

1522
02:08:20,610 --> 02:08:23,153
當你從世界出發 想幫助自己
When you set out in the world
to help yourself...

1523
02:08:23,321 --> 02:08:25,614
結果或許會是你幫助了圖蒂
(每個人)
...sometimes you end up
helping Tutti.

1524
02:08:28,951 --> 02:08:32,162
- 再說一次
- 一萬八千美金
-Tell me again.
-Eighteen thousand American dollars.

1525
02:08:32,330 --> 02:08:34,998
我把郵件帶來給你看了
I brought you the e-mails to look at.

1526
02:08:37,460 --> 02:08:38,668
我的天哪
Oh, my God.

1527
02:08:38,836 --> 02:08:40,128
我們有家了
We get a house.

1528
02:08:40,296 --> 02:08:43,507
這是每個人的家!
It can be the house for everybody!

1529
02:08:45,510 --> 02:08:48,845
我可以擁有一間藥房! 一個圖書館!
I can have a pharmacy!
I can have a library!

1530
02:08:50,014 --> 02:08:52,682
- 好啦 天哪
- 再閉一次 閉上眼睛
-All right. Oh, God.
-Close them again. Close your eyes.

1531
02:08:52,850 --> 02:08:55,185
小心點 別磕掉牙齒了
Careful. You don't wanna
break a tooth or anything.

1532
02:08:55,353 --> 02:08:58,188
- 不用擔心 閉上眼睛就好
- 你要帶我去哪裏?
-Don't worry, but close your eyes.
-Where are you taking me?

1533
02:08:58,356 --> 02:08:59,356
你會知道的
You will see.

1534
02:08:59,524 --> 02:09:02,025
- 你幫助懷恩得到了一座房子
- 我知道
-You helped Wayan to get a house...
-l know.

1535
02:09:02,193 --> 02:09:03,693
我們得慶祝一番
...and we're going to celebrate.

1536
02:09:03,861 --> 02:09:05,487
- 在這裏 在這
- 好
-Here, here, here.
-All right.

1537
02:09:05,655 --> 02:09:08,156
- 睜眼 睜開眼吧
- 我知道我們在沙灘上 可沒帶泳衣
-Turn, turn, turn.
-l know we're at the beach.

1538
02:09:08,324 --> 02:09:10,200
就是這裏
Here you go.

1539
02:09:11,369 --> 02:09:13,328
我們要划船
We're going to take a little boat trip.

1540
02:09:14,539 --> 02:09:15,539
- 去哪?
Where?

1541
02:09:15,748 --> 02:09:18,708
- 去哪?
- 去一座附近的小島
Where? To a little island nearby.

1542
02:09:18,876 --> 02:09:22,379
是我在全世界最喜歡的地方
我幫我們打點好行李了
It's my favorite place in the world.
I've packed for two.

1543
02:09:22,547 --> 02:09:27,384
我們可以在那裏待到下週二
在最好的野營點享受一番
We can stay there until next Tuesday.
And l have the perfect camping spot.

1544
02:09:27,885 --> 02:09:31,555
只有你我 和四百隻鸚鵡
Just you and l and 400 parrots.

1545
02:09:34,392 --> 02:09:36,518
你喜歡嗎?
Do you like it?

1546
02:09:38,563 --> 02:09:43,233
我本想晚上再說的
但現在時機成熟了
I was going to save it for tonight,
but I think this is the right moment.

1547
02:09:43,401 --> 02:09:46,194
我必須待在巴里島
是因為我的事業在這裏
I have to be in Bali
because my business is here...

1548
02:09:46,362 --> 02:09:48,071
你必須待在紐約
...and you have to be in New York...

1549
02:09:48,239 --> 02:09:50,907
是因為你的生活在那裏 對嗎?
...because that's
where your life is, right?

1550
02:09:51,409 --> 02:09:55,370
不如我們在這兩個地方之間
創建一種新的生活方式?
What if we tried to create a life that
is divided between the two places?

1551
02:10:00,543 --> 02:10:02,294
你為什麼要這樣做?
Why would you wanna do that?

1552
02:10:02,795 --> 02:10:04,921
因為我愛上你了
Because I'm in love with you.

1553
02:10:10,553 --> 02:10:12,804
- 我們走吧 我們走吧
- 不 我....
-Let's go. Let's go.
-Oh, no. I....

1554
02:10:13,931 --> 02:10:16,057
- 怎麼?
- 我做不到 很抱歉
-What?
-l can't. l'm sorry.

1555
02:10:16,601 --> 02:10:17,767
- 只不過我
- 你做不到?
-l just....
-You can't?

1556
02:10:17,935 --> 02:10:19,436
- 我很抱歉 我做不到
- 做不到什麼?
-l'm sorry. I can't.
-Can't what?

1557
02:10:19,604 --> 02:10:24,441
我現在不能出行 懂嗎 我....
I can't go on a trip right now,
okay? I....

1558
02:10:24,609 --> 02:10:28,445
我5天沒回家 幾周沒見科圖
I haven't been home in five days.
I haven't seen Ketut in weeks.

1559
02:10:28,613 --> 02:10:31,114
- 太久了
- 不算太久
-lt's just too much.
-lt's not much.

1560
02:10:33,784 --> 02:10:35,452
出行
To go...

1561
02:10:35,620 --> 02:10:37,120
雙人之旅
...by ourselves...

1562
02:10:37,288 --> 02:10:41,625
遠離塵囂 幾天而已
對你來說太久了嗎?
...apart from everything else for
a couple of days, is that much for you?

1563
02:10:41,834 --> 02:10:44,878
我不明白 問題在哪裏  麗茲?
Liz, não entendo.
What's the problem, Liz?

1564
02:10:45,046 --> 02:10:48,715
我心裏有恐懼 我和你受過一樣的傷
I mean, l have the same fears,
I have the same scars that you have...

1565
02:10:48,883 --> 02:10:50,925
我讓你看我的傷口
...and l show them to you.

1566
02:10:51,093 --> 02:10:54,721
你我之間唯一不同之處是
But l guess the only difference
between you and l is that...

1567
02:10:55,097 --> 02:10:56,806
你失去了愛的勇氣
...you are afraid to love again.

1568
02:10:56,974 --> 02:10:58,350
親愛的 事實擺在眼前
My darling, this is it.

1569
02:10:58,726 --> 02:11:01,645
你要看著我的眼睛 告訴我實情
You have to look me in the eye
and let me know the truth.

1570
02:11:02,271 --> 02:11:06,107
拜託了 你愛我 還是不愛?
Please. Do you love me
or do you love me not?

1571
02:11:10,154 --> 02:11:11,738
看著我的眼睛 告訴我
Look me in the eyes and tell me...

1572
02:11:11,906 --> 02:11:15,367
你愛我 還是不愛? 很簡單的
...do you love me or don't
you love me not? lt's very easy.

1573
02:11:15,951 --> 02:11:18,495
我知道你也有一樣的感覺
為什麼你不能說出口?
I know you feel the same way.
Why can't you say it back?

1574
02:11:18,663 --> 02:11:20,747
我不知道原因
I don't know why.

1575
02:11:22,792 --> 02:11:24,000
為什麼我不能?
Why can't l?

1576
02:11:24,168 --> 02:11:27,504
因為你怕 我的愛人
可是沒關係的 我也怕
Because you're terrified, my love.
But listen, it's fine. Me too.

1577
02:11:27,880 --> 02:11:30,840
但我還是希望可以和你一起上船
But l still want to get
into that boat with you.

1578
02:11:31,008 --> 02:11:33,510
- 不 你看 你看
- 什麼?
-No. Okay, look. Look.
-What?

1579
02:11:33,678 --> 02:11:36,680
我不知道為什麼你不懂
I don't know why
you can't understand this.

1580
02:11:36,889 --> 02:11:40,433
我找到某個東西 我不能放棄
I found something
and l can't give it up.

1581
02:11:40,601 --> 02:11:44,854
相信我 如果我放棄了
你也不會如此愛我
And trust me, if I did,
you wouldn't be so all in love with me.

1582
02:11:45,022 --> 02:11:48,525
好 是平衡 你環遊世界尋找你的平衡
Okay, the balance thing. You traveled
around the world to find your balance.

1583
02:11:48,693 --> 02:11:51,194
你以為自己找到了什麼平衡?
And the balance that you think
you've found is what?

1584
02:11:51,404 --> 02:11:55,323
冥想20分鐘 然後去見個老巫醫?
Meditating for 20 minutes and
going to see an old medicine man?

1585
02:11:55,491 --> 02:11:59,202
平衡 我的愛人啊
平衡不是讓某人愛你
Listen, balance, my darling, balance
is not letting anybody love you...

1586
02:11:59,412 --> 02:12:02,372
- 少於你愛自己
- 你懂什麼 你懂什麼
-...less than you love yourself.
-You know what? You know what?

1587
02:12:02,540 --> 02:12:06,459
不用你告訴我
我在過去一年學到什麼
Do not tell me what lessons l have
and haven't learned in the last year...

1588
02:12:06,627 --> 02:12:09,045
也不用告訴我 你有多平衡多睿智
...and don't tell me how balanced
and wise you are...

1589
02:12:09,213 --> 02:12:11,548
我表達自己有多失敗
...and how I can't express myself.

1590
02:12:11,716 --> 02:12:15,385
不要再叫我"親愛的"因為我不稀罕了
And do not say "darling" to me again
because l am just gonna lose it.

1591
02:12:15,553 --> 02:12:19,848
聽我說! 我不要通過愛你
來證明我愛自己
Listen to me! l do not need to love you
to prove that l love myself.

1592
02:12:26,814 --> 02:12:28,732
你要離開我嗎?
Run away from me?

1593
02:12:29,400 --> 02:12:34,863
你放棄了自己生命中
各種絕妙的可能
You are running away from all
the great possibilities of your own life.

1594
02:12:38,701 --> 02:12:41,077
我要上船了
I'm getting into that boat.

1595
02:14:08,332 --> 02:14:09,499
給你的
For you.

1596
02:14:09,667 --> 02:14:12,001
離別的禮物
A goodbye gift.

1597
02:14:20,344 --> 02:14:21,845
科圖
Ketut.

1598
02:14:32,857 --> 02:14:34,691
麗茲
Liss...

1599
02:14:35,067 --> 02:14:37,318
你治癒了我
...you healed me.

1600
02:14:39,488 --> 02:14:41,990
你也治癒了我 科圖
You healed me too, Ketut.

1601
02:14:44,618 --> 02:14:47,620
要不是你 我不會回到巴里島...
If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't have come back to Bali...

1602
02:14:47,788 --> 02:14:50,540
或許就沒法面對自我
...and l wouldn't have come back
to myself.

1603
02:14:50,708 --> 02:14:53,001
你要咖啡嗎? 還是烤豬肉?
You want coffee? Roast pig?

1604
02:14:54,461 --> 02:14:56,045
咖啡
Coffee.

1605
02:14:56,213 --> 02:14:57,505
我幫你倒咖啡
I get you coffee.

1606
02:14:57,673 --> 02:14:59,549
你馬上就要飛回美國了嗎?
You fly back to America soon?

1607
02:14:59,717 --> 02:15:01,885
還有兩小時
In two hours.

1608
02:15:02,052 --> 02:15:03,887
你坐過飛機嗎 科圖?
Have you ever been
on an airplane, Ketut?

1609
02:15:04,597 --> 02:15:07,390
科圖不能坐飛機
Ketut cannot fly on aeroplane.

1610
02:15:08,726 --> 02:15:11,227
科圖沒有牙
Ketut have no teeths.

1611
02:15:14,899 --> 02:15:18,067
你是我的好朋友
You are good friend to me.

1612
02:15:18,235 --> 02:15:19,903
就像個女兒
You are like daughter.

1613
02:15:21,030 --> 02:15:23,156
我死的時候
When I die...

1614
02:15:23,324 --> 02:15:26,701
你會回到巴里島 看我火化嗎?
...you will come back to Bali?
Come to my cremation?

1615
02:15:27,620 --> 02:15:30,121
巴里島人的火化儀式很有趣的
Balinese cremation ceremony
is very fun.

1616
02:15:30,915 --> 02:15:32,916
- 你會喜歡的
- 好吧
-You will like it.
-Okay.

1617
02:15:34,376 --> 02:15:39,380
你還會像我和你說那樣開懷大笑吧
You still smile with your liver,
like l tell you?

1618
02:15:39,548 --> 02:15:40,590
是的
Yes.

1619
02:15:40,758 --> 02:15:44,761
你還會像你印度導師教導那樣冥想吧
You still meditate like your guru
in India teach you?

1620
02:15:45,137 --> 02:15:47,138
- 是的
- 你現在對上帝滿意嗎?
-Yes.
-You happy now with God?

1621
02:15:48,223 --> 02:15:52,060
- 是的
- 你愛你的新男友嗎?
-Yes.
-You love your new boyfriend?

1622
02:15:57,942 --> 02:15:59,859
我和他分開了
I ended it.

1623
02:16:01,654 --> 02:16:03,905
我不懂 為什麼你要分開?
Don't understand.
Why you do that?

1624
02:16:07,785 --> 02:16:10,787
我沒法保持平衡
I couldn't keep my balance.

1625
02:16:12,289 --> 02:16:16,376
麗茲 聽科圖的話
Liss, listen to Ketut.

1626
02:16:16,543 --> 02:16:20,713
有時候因愛失衡
Sometimes to lose balance
for love...

1627
02:16:20,881 --> 02:16:25,176
也是平衡生活的一部分
...is part of living balanced life.

1628
02:16:39,316 --> 02:16:41,150
在最後
In the end...

1629
02:16:41,318 --> 02:16:46,114
我相信了我稱之為
"尋覓物理學"的東西
...I've come to believe in something
I call "The Physics of the Quest."

1630
02:16:48,158 --> 02:16:52,996
一種自然界的力
就如萬有引力定律一樣真實
A force in nature governed by laws
as real as the laws of gravity.

1631
02:16:53,497 --> 02:16:57,000
尋覓物理學的法則是這樣的
The rule of Quest Physics
goes something like this:

1632
02:16:57,209 --> 02:17:01,295
如果你有足夠的勇氣
放棄所有熟悉安心的事物
If you're brave enough to leave behind
everything familiar and comforting...

1633
02:17:01,463 --> 02:17:04,966
這包括你的家
或是累積在心底的怨恨
...which can be anything from your
house to bitter, old resentments...

1634
02:17:05,134 --> 02:17:07,677
開始一段尋求真相的旅程
...and set out
on a truth-seeking journey...

1635
02:17:07,845 --> 02:17:10,805
無論是外在的還是內在的
...either externally or internally...

1636
02:17:10,973 --> 02:17:13,516
如果你真的願意
...and if you are truly willing
to regard everything...

1637
02:17:13,684 --> 02:17:16,686
把所有經歷看做成一種啟示
...that happens to you on that journey
as a clue...

1638
02:17:16,854 --> 02:17:21,357
如果你把所有遇見的人都當成導師
...and if you accept everyone you
meet along the way as a teacher...

1639
02:17:25,863 --> 02:17:28,364
最重要的是 如果你準備好
...and if you are prepared,
most of all...

1640
02:17:28,532 --> 02:17:32,869
去面對 原諒那部分並不討喜的自我
...to face and forgive some
very difficult realities about yourself...

1641
02:17:33,037 --> 02:17:35,371
那麼 沒人可以阻止你瞭解真相
...then the truth
will not be withheld from you.

1642
02:17:36,040 --> 02:17:37,790
菲利培?
Felipe?

1643
02:17:50,137 --> 02:17:52,788
我自身的經歷使我不由得相信
I can't help but believe it,
given my experience.

1644
02:17:52,888 --> 02:17:53,888
日落時分  碼頭見

1645
02:18:25,756 --> 02:18:28,299
我決定了屬於我的詞
I decided on my word.

1646
02:18:36,433 --> 02:18:38,434
意思是
It means:

1647
02:18:40,270 --> 02:18:42,605
"讓我們跨越過去"
"Let's cross over."
