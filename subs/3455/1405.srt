1
00:04:14,856 --> 00:04:18,883
Come on. It's all right.

2
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:21,188
Yes, it's all right.

3
00:04:29,037 --> 00:04:31,232
Wake up, Will.

4
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:40,306
Starboard bow ahoy.

5
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:51,181
- What is it, Slade?
- Thought I heard somethin'.

6
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:53,352
Sounded like a bell.

7
00:04:54,929 --> 00:04:59,161
- Native fishermen, perhaps.
- Or a reef marker, sir.

8
00:04:59,234 --> 00:05:02,203
Mr Calamy, the lead, if you please.

9
00:05:17,118 --> 00:05:21,282
- By the mark, five fathom.
- Five fathom.

10
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,769
Sand and broken shell.

11
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:47,911
What is it?

12
00:05:49,984 --> 00:05:52,612
Two points off the starboard bow,
in the fog bank.

13
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,745
What was it? A sail?

14
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:59,316
- I don't know what it was.
- Should we beat to quarters?

15
00:06:06,601 --> 00:06:10,970
- I can't be certain.
- You're officer of the watch.

16
00:06:11,072 --> 00:06:14,064
Hollom, you must make a decision.

17
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,908
We shall beat to quarters.

18
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:23,277
Rouse up. Sleepers awake.

19
00:06:27,522 --> 00:06:29,615
Move. Move along.

20
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:32,819
Jump to it, boys. Jump to it.

21
00:06:34,295 --> 00:06:36,195
Light along there.

22
00:06:57,986 --> 00:06:59,613
Sighting in heavy fog.

23
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:03,214
- Handsomely on the yards tackle.
- Topmen aloft.

24
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:14,297
Where away?

25
00:07:14,369 --> 00:07:19,136
Two points off the starboard bow, sir.
Not a mile distant.

26
00:07:22,043 --> 00:07:25,012
- You sure, Mr Hollom?
- Yes, sir.

27
00:07:26,381 --> 00:07:28,474
Man-of-war?

28
00:07:30,485 --> 00:07:32,350
I don't know, sir.

29
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:36,254
It was only for a moment.
I thought I saw a shape.

30
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:42,492
- Did you see it, Mr Calamy?
- No, sir.

31
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:49,229
You did the right thing, Mr Hollom.
Go to your stations.

32
00:07:50,705 --> 00:07:53,071
The deck's yours, Tom.

33
00:07:53,174 --> 00:07:54,607
Sir.

34
00:07:57,111 --> 00:08:00,911
Clear away. And launch boats.

35
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:11,720
- Quit your dawdling.
- You heard the man.

36
00:08:11,793 --> 00:08:14,261
Lower away.

37
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,224
Haul both your yard tackles.

38
00:08:23,538 --> 00:08:25,301
Strike the bell.

39
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,900
Down. All hands down.

40
00:09:09,317 --> 00:09:13,413
Hands to your stations.
Mr Hollar, damage report, if you please.

41
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:26,364
18-pounders. We'll have to get closer.
Run out the starboard battery.

42
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:30,267
Mr Allen, come up on the wind.
Lay me alongside at pistol-shot.

43
00:09:36,444 --> 00:09:38,674
Sharpshooters to the tops, Mr Howard.

44
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,340
Sergeant. Take your section
into the main top.

45
00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:44,384
We stand tall on the quarterdeck.
All of us.

46
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,489
- Mr Boyle, run up the colors.
- Aye, sir.

47
00:09:53,494 --> 00:09:57,453
Note for the log, Mr Watt.
"Engaged enemy frigate at six bells."

48
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:04,563
- Straight at 'em, Mr Mowett.
- Straight at 'em, sir.

49
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:07,072
Bill.

50
00:10:07,175 --> 00:10:10,042
Leave the swords.
Get the captain's silver below.

51
00:10:10,144 --> 00:10:14,171
She's not in range yet.
Stand fast till she's close enough.

52
00:10:14,248 --> 00:10:18,082
- Close with him amidships.
- Midships it is, sir.

53
00:10:18,753 --> 00:10:21,085
For God's sake, don't drop anything.

54
00:10:26,394 --> 00:10:27,588
Steady.

55
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:31,222
- Hold your positions.
- Hold your position. Courage, now.

56
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:36,700
- Hold steady, boys.
- Don't worry, lads, we'll serve 'em out yet.

57
00:10:36,771 --> 00:10:41,174
Mr Pullings, sir.
Davies, Jemmy, get Mr Pullings below.

58
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:42,903
Aye, sir.

59
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,535
Mr Blakeney, pass the word for the captain.

60
00:10:45,613 --> 00:10:48,377
Clear the forward pin rails.

61
00:10:54,789 --> 00:10:56,416
More sand on the floor.

62
00:10:58,025 --> 00:11:00,084
On the up-roll, fire!

63
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:14,768
Down!

64
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:28,279
Relieving-tackles on the tiller.
You men, collect these wounded.

65
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:35,486
- Keep 'em spitting, Mr Calamy.
- Aye, sir. Reload and give 'em hell.

66
00:12:01,656 --> 00:12:03,954
Sir. To the taffrail.

67
00:12:10,498 --> 00:12:13,592
The rudder's shot away.
The steering don't answer.

68
00:12:13,668 --> 00:12:15,966
We're fish in a barrel.

69
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,542
Why are we not firing?

70
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:31,507
Let me through.

71
00:12:31,619 --> 00:12:34,110
Here, Joe.

72
00:12:34,188 --> 00:12:36,281
Hold it in there.

73
00:12:40,728 --> 00:12:45,722
- He's on the larboard bow, sir.
- Bring up your small arms.

74
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:51,327
Prepare to repel boarders.

75
00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:54,568
Seize your weapons
and wait for the word.

76
00:12:56,677 --> 00:12:59,009
Your orders, sir?

77
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:04,350
Call the gun crews to deck. Rig man-ropes
over the stern and pull the boats in.

78
00:13:04,418 --> 00:13:07,012
Put us in that fog, Tom.

79
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:20,524
Pull together, men.

80
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:22,728
Pull for the fog bank.

81
00:13:24,105 --> 00:13:26,665
Run 'em out.

82
00:13:31,045 --> 00:13:32,706
Fire!

83
00:13:34,015 --> 00:13:38,042
She's opened up a seam.
We need to get some oakum and pound it in.

84
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:40,883
Joe, a mallet and some irons.

85
00:13:46,794 --> 00:13:49,024
She's gaining on us.

86
00:13:56,137 --> 00:14:00,073
- We're nearly there, boys.
- Pull.

87
00:14:00,141 --> 00:14:03,372
- Reach for it, men.
- We're home inside that fog.

88
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:09,446
Fire!

89
00:14:11,052 --> 00:14:13,953
Pull for Lucky Jack.

90
00:14:14,055 --> 00:14:16,216
We've done it.

91
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:21,392
Pipe down. Silence on deck.

92
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:34,433
They'll not find us in here.

93
00:14:34,508 --> 00:14:38,137
Quiet, lads. No shouts, no calls.

94
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,335
Avast rowing.

95
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:13,678
Well done, lads.

96
00:15:37,705 --> 00:15:41,038
Two feet six inches, sir, and holding.

97
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:47,408
- Good work, Mr Lamb.
- Thank you, sir.

98
00:15:57,992 --> 00:16:00,153
So, what's the butcher's bill?

99
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:02,821
Nine dead, 27 wounded.

100
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:13,539
Joe Plaice.

101
00:16:13,607 --> 00:16:18,943
He has a severely depressed fracture of
the skull. I don't think he'll see out the night.

102
00:16:19,046 --> 00:16:21,844
Lord Blakeney.

103
00:16:24,218 --> 00:16:26,516
Just a broken arm, sir.

104
00:16:27,788 --> 00:16:30,757
You're in very good hands.

105
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:39,057
I'm doing everything I can.
I know you were close to his father.

106
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:43,536
His father would've understood.
He knew the life. His mother, however...

107
00:16:43,604 --> 00:16:47,096
Let me take a look at that brow of yours.

108
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,073
What?

109
00:16:53,814 --> 00:16:56,908
Damn, he was good.
Just came out of nowhere.

110
00:16:56,984 --> 00:17:02,115
Hit us with a full broadside,
cut across our tail and took out our rudder.

111
00:17:02,223 --> 00:17:04,453
Damn fine gunnery.

112
00:17:05,426 --> 00:17:10,090
We only slipped away because of the fog.
Quite fortunate, really.

113
00:17:10,164 --> 00:17:14,931
He may have had the weather gauge,
but we had the weather gods.

114
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:21,806
I have no idea what it is you're talking about,
but he did seem to come off rather well.

115
00:17:22,743 --> 00:17:28,079
Seven weeks sailing, and he happens
in darkness on our exact position.

116
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:34,581
The French have their spies
in England and elsewhere. As do we.

117
00:17:35,189 --> 00:17:37,089
Indeed.

118
00:17:38,292 --> 00:17:44,356
If he knew we were looking for him, he could
have stood to sea and passed well clear.

119
00:17:44,465 --> 00:17:47,628
Well then, perhaps he was looking for us.

120
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:16,352
If she was a frigate, then I am a Dutchman.

121
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:19,398
It was an unfair match.
There was no dishonor in it.

122
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,730
She was more like a ship of the line.

123
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:25,168
You have to wonder about her hull.
Our shots wouldn't penetrate.

124
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:27,867
Triple-shotted at 200 yards - no effect.

125
00:18:27,975 --> 00:18:31,706
She had the weather gauge
and a clear advantage in firepower.

126
00:18:31,812 --> 00:18:34,372
What is the weather gauge?

127
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:38,008
- Shall I show you again, Stephen?
- Not on the cloth.

128
00:18:40,087 --> 00:18:44,217
It means she had the wind in her favor,
therefore control of the engagement.

129
00:18:44,325 --> 00:18:47,658
And she had longer guns,
so she could hit us beyond our range.

130
00:18:47,728 --> 00:18:51,391
The simple fact is we were soundly beaten.

131
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:58,931
- Heavy frigate like that in the Pacific...
- Could tip the war in Napoleon's favor.

132
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:04,569
By comparison, the Surprise
is a somewhat aged man-of-war.

133
00:19:08,282 --> 00:19:13,083
- Am I not correct?
- Would you call me an aged man of war?

134
00:19:13,187 --> 00:19:16,520
The Surprise is not old.
No one would call her old.

135
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:22,756
She has a bluff bow, lovely lines.
She's a fine sea boat, weatherly, stiff and fast.

136
00:19:22,863 --> 00:19:26,230
Very fast, if she's well-handled.

137
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,427
No, she's not old.

138
00:19:29,737 --> 00:19:31,762
She's in her prime.

139
00:19:31,872 --> 00:19:36,434
We can patch up the main and mizzen.
Foresail's gone, so we'll bend our spare.

140
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:40,604
Mr Lamb is confident with basic repairs.
We can get home as we are.

141
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:43,547
We're not going home.

142
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:56,623
But to refit we need a port,
and the Acheron may be still looking for us.

143
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:01,064
We can refit at sea.
Here, where it shoals.

144
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:07,002
As you said, she is taking the war to
the South Seas. We are supposed to stop her.

145
00:20:07,107 --> 00:20:14,343
But, sir - with respect - she's a vastly
heavier ship. She's out of our class.

146
00:20:15,282 --> 00:20:18,979
She could be halfway to Cape Horn
by the time we're repaired.

147
00:20:19,086 --> 00:20:22,783
Well then, there's not a moment to lose.

148
00:20:41,175 --> 00:20:44,338
Is it true they put the last stitch
through your nose?

149
00:20:44,445 --> 00:20:46,504
What do you mean?

150
00:20:47,548 --> 00:20:52,884
Joe said when you die, they stitch you in your
hammock with the last stitch in your nose,

151
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:56,183
just to make sure you're not asleep.

152
00:20:59,827 --> 00:21:03,285
Not through the nose. You'll tell them?

153
00:21:59,953 --> 00:22:04,447
It's all right.
It's just the laudanum speaking.

154
00:22:38,058 --> 00:22:40,822
I've never seen a braver patient.

155
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:49,727
Poor darling.
Never mind, soon have you fixed up.

156
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:51,771
I want good work now.

157
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:56,332
I'll need two men into the starboard
forechannels. Roberts, Chadwick.

158
00:22:56,443 --> 00:22:58,502
That's nice work there.

159
00:22:58,612 --> 00:23:01,911
Repair won't do here.
I need these replaced.

160
00:23:08,622 --> 00:23:11,955
Mr Calamy. There's something
might interest you here.

161
00:23:12,025 --> 00:23:16,621
Look. The captain carved that.
When he was a mid, no more than your age.

162
00:23:16,697 --> 00:23:18,597
He's known this ship man and boy.

163
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:23,864
He says there's enough of his blood in the
woodwork for the ship to almost be a relation.

164
00:23:23,971 --> 00:23:28,203
I do understand your point.
Your knowledge is beyond question.

165
00:23:28,308 --> 00:23:33,712
However, a week in the Brazilian rain forest
looking for a new mast simply will not do.

166
00:23:33,814 --> 00:23:36,044
The Acheron will be halfway to China.

167
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:41,883
Mr Lamb, as always, will do his best. Which
is all I can hope to expect from any man.

168
00:24:15,922 --> 00:24:17,719
Is them his brains?

169
00:24:17,824 --> 00:24:21,692
No, that's just dried blood.
Those are his brains.

170
00:24:27,034 --> 00:24:30,367
Physician, he is.
Ain't one of your common surgeons.

171
00:24:30,437 --> 00:24:33,600
- Can I have the coin, please?
- Sir.

172
00:24:38,345 --> 00:24:41,075
He wouldn't look at you
for under ten guineas on land.

173
00:24:41,181 --> 00:24:43,342
And he knows his birds and beasts.

174
00:24:43,417 --> 00:24:46,784
You show him a beetle
and he'll tell you what it's thinking.

175
00:24:46,887 --> 00:24:50,414
Back to work, you loafers.
Eckhart, use your pipe.

176
00:24:50,524 --> 00:24:52,924
Let's get on with it, gentlemen.

177
00:24:53,026 --> 00:24:56,792
You're not a pennyweight of use
gawpin' here.

178
00:25:03,403 --> 00:25:05,963
Still hasn't said a word, sir.

179
00:25:11,411 --> 00:25:14,403
Lord Blakeney. Feeling better?

180
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:16,574
Much better, thank you, sir.

181
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,743
Well, good. Good.

182
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:24,750
The doctor told me
you were fond of reading, so I...

183
00:25:30,997 --> 00:25:34,489
It has all of his major battles
and some fine illustrations.

184
00:25:34,601 --> 00:25:36,501
Thank you, sir.

185
00:25:37,738 --> 00:25:40,298
Did you ever meet Lord Nelson, sir?

186
00:25:40,407 --> 00:25:44,104
I had the honor of serving with him.
At the Nile. A great victory.

187
00:25:44,177 --> 00:25:50,275
You can find it in here, actually.
Page 135, if I'm not mistaken.

188
00:25:51,685 --> 00:25:53,585
Yes.

189
00:25:59,493 --> 00:26:03,361
May I beg you to tell me
what kind of man he is?

190
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:07,590
You should read the book.

191
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:10,261
I will, sir. Thank you.

192
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:36,054
Here we go again.
Scrape-scrape, screech-screech.

193
00:26:36,163 --> 00:26:40,065
Never a tune you could dance to,
not if you were drunk as Davy's sow.

194
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:51,807
How about this?

195
00:26:51,878 --> 00:26:56,338
Or are you in the mood
for something more aggressive?

196
00:28:09,723 --> 00:28:11,884
Salute.

197
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:13,892
Hats off.

198
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:18,223
What's all this about?

199
00:28:20,967 --> 00:28:24,300
- What's this?
- It's the phantom, sir.

200
00:28:24,404 --> 00:28:28,170
Excuse me. That's what the men call it.
It's the Acheron, sir.

201
00:28:28,275 --> 00:28:31,176
You see, Will here, he seen her being built.

202
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:36,443
In Boston, sir. During the peace.
But she's Yankee-built, sir.

203
00:28:36,516 --> 00:28:40,452
He was getting married, and his wife's
second cousin works in the yards,

204
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,784
so Will here saw the ship out of water.

205
00:28:42,856 --> 00:28:48,123
Sir, I saw there was something right strange
about her, so I asked Joe...

206
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:51,493
So he described it to me
and I knocked you up a model, sir.

207
00:28:51,598 --> 00:28:56,331
- And this framing is accurate?
- Exactly accurate, sir.

208
00:28:56,436 --> 00:28:58,996
- Thank you, lads.
- Thank you, sir.

209
00:28:59,105 --> 00:29:02,336
Killick, an extra ration of rum for these men.

210
00:29:02,442 --> 00:29:04,842
Thank you very much, sir.

211
00:29:04,945 --> 00:29:07,937
- Which I was saving for Salutin' Day.
- We'll drink wine.

212
00:29:08,014 --> 00:29:10,141
Oh, drink wine on Salutin' Day.

213
00:29:10,216 --> 00:29:12,878
Bluff above the water and sharp below.

214
00:29:12,986 --> 00:29:18,390
Gives the hull a finer entry and a long run
as she goes aft. That's why she's so fast.

215
00:29:18,491 --> 00:29:21,119
Heavier, but fast despite it.

216
00:29:22,162 --> 00:29:27,498
That's the future.
What a fascinating modern age we live in.

217
00:29:27,567 --> 00:29:31,469
Planking and framing like that
would make her hull 2ft thick. Solid oak.

218
00:29:31,538 --> 00:29:36,498
That's why we couldn't dent her. She's
probably capable of making 12 to 14 knots.

219
00:29:37,177 --> 00:29:40,510
Now we know. Thank God for Warley
and his wife's second cousin.

220
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,549
She could be doing up to 280 miles a day.

221
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:49,680
Even if we did catch up with her,
I mean, to take her...

222
00:29:49,756 --> 00:29:53,886
She's out of our class.
She's a 44-gun ship.

223
00:29:55,495 --> 00:29:59,932
She's still vulnerable at the stern,
like the rest of us.

224
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,706
Hello, darling. How much for a kiss?

225
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,509
Quanto cost-o kiss-o?

226
00:30:19,586 --> 00:30:22,783
- Name?
- My name is Maria.

227
00:30:22,889 --> 00:30:26,188
Give us arrows. I give ax. Quick, mate.

228
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:28,523
Thank you, mate.

229
00:30:37,137 --> 00:30:40,072
Gangway for the mail, please.

230
00:30:41,207 --> 00:30:44,608
Here we are. Very important mail. Letters.

231
00:30:44,711 --> 00:30:47,976
What's he saying?

232
00:30:51,584 --> 00:30:55,418
A large man-of-war, French, stopped here
on the 10th, then headed south.

233
00:31:01,161 --> 00:31:02,992
Somewhere here.

234
00:31:03,096 --> 00:31:05,656
A full three weeks ahead.

235
00:31:05,765 --> 00:31:07,630
Damn.

236
00:31:08,568 --> 00:31:11,332
All right, Tom, let's get all this squared away.

237
00:31:11,438 --> 00:31:15,340
Aye, sir. Mr Hollar.
Let us complete our business here.

238
00:31:15,442 --> 00:31:18,172
Hands, prepare to weigh anchor.

239
00:31:20,146 --> 00:31:27,348
Put that woman down, Slade. This is a ship
of His Majesty's Navy, not a floating bordello.

240
00:31:30,156 --> 00:31:34,286
All hands, get these provisions stowed.

241
00:31:46,773 --> 00:31:48,365
Well done.

242
00:31:48,475 --> 00:31:50,534
Gentlemen.

243
00:31:51,544 --> 00:31:56,538
To wives and to sweethearts.

244
00:31:56,649 --> 00:32:00,016
May they never meet.

245
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:04,022
Mr Howard, the bottle.
The bottle stands by you, sir.

246
00:32:04,624 --> 00:32:06,956
Sir?

247
00:32:07,794 --> 00:32:12,356
Excuse me, sir, but Mr Blakeney said that
you served under Lord Nelson at the Nile.

248
00:32:12,465 --> 00:32:17,368
Indeed. I was a young lieutenant,
not much older than you are now.

249
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:21,031
And Mr Pullings was
a sniveling midshipman,

250
00:32:21,141 --> 00:32:23,507
still yearning for hearth and home.

251
00:32:23,576 --> 00:32:26,739
Did you meet him, sir?
Can you tell me what he's like?

252
00:32:26,846 --> 00:32:29,974
I have had the honor
of dining with him twice.

253
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:32,916
He spoke to me on both occasions.

254
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:36,182
A master tactician
and a man of singular vision.

255
00:32:36,256 --> 00:32:41,523
He always said in battle "Never mind
the maneuvers, just go straight at 'em."

256
00:32:41,594 --> 00:32:45,758
Some would say not a great seaman,
but a great leader.

257
00:32:45,865 --> 00:32:48,891
He's England's only hope
if old Boney intends to invade.

258
00:32:49,002 --> 00:32:52,369
Sir, might we press you for an anecdote?

259
00:32:55,341 --> 00:32:58,401
The first time that he spoke to me,

260
00:32:58,511 --> 00:33:03,710
I shall never forget his words.
I remember it like it was yesterday.

261
00:33:03,783 --> 00:33:07,549
He leaned across the table,
he looked me straight in the eye,

262
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:12,284
and he said "Aubrey,
may I trouble you for the salt?"

263
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:19,525
I've always tried to say it
exactly as he did ever since.

264
00:33:25,305 --> 00:33:30,709
The second time,
the second time he told me a story

265
00:33:30,777 --> 00:33:34,304
about how someone offered him
a boat cloak on a cold night.

266
00:33:34,414 --> 00:33:39,283
And he said no, he didn't need it.
That he was quite warm.

267
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:44,049
His zeal for king and country kept him warm.

268
00:33:44,123 --> 00:33:48,150
I know it sounds absurd,
and were it from another man,

269
00:33:48,261 --> 00:33:53,563
you'd cry out "What pitiful stuff"
and dismiss it as mere enthusiasm.

270
00:33:53,633 --> 00:33:55,726
But with Nelson,

271
00:33:57,604 --> 00:34:00,437
you felt your heart glow.

272
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:11,739
- Wouldn't you say, Mr Pullings?
- You did indeed, sir.

273
00:34:12,318 --> 00:34:18,780
Well then, he would seem to be the exception
to the rule that authority corrupts.

274
00:34:18,858 --> 00:34:22,191
To Lord Nelson.

275
00:34:25,965 --> 00:34:29,332
Do you see those two weevils, Doctor?

276
00:34:29,435 --> 00:34:30,959
I do.

277
00:34:31,037 --> 00:34:33,369
Which would you choose?

278
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:40,310
Neither. There's no difference between them.
They're the same species of curculio.

279
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,814
If you had to choose.

280
00:34:42,882 --> 00:34:46,340
If you were forced to make a choice.
If there was no other...

281
00:34:46,452 --> 00:34:50,047
Well then, if you're going to push me,

282
00:34:52,358 --> 00:34:55,350
I would choose the right-hand weevil.

283
00:34:55,461 --> 00:34:59,192
It has significant advantage
in both length and breadth.

284
00:34:59,299 --> 00:35:02,632
There, I have you.
You're completely dished.

285
00:35:02,702 --> 00:35:08,641
Do you not know that in the service one must
always choose the lesser of two weevils?

286
00:35:15,315 --> 00:35:18,716
He who would pun would pick a pocket.

287
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:22,483
Really. Weevils.

288
00:35:22,555 --> 00:35:27,891
To the lesser of two weevils.

289
00:35:38,538 --> 00:35:41,507
Yay, Joe.

290
00:35:44,043 --> 00:35:46,102
Go on, Joe.

291
00:36:04,764 --> 00:36:07,062
The Lord taketh,

292
00:36:08,267 --> 00:36:11,202
and the Lord giveth away.

293
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:14,137
You hear that? He said something.

294
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,107
Doctor. He spoke, Doctor.

295
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:19,110
Well done indeed, Stephen.

296
00:36:19,212 --> 00:36:22,204
Adieu to you Spanish ladies

297
00:36:22,281 --> 00:36:26,411
Farewell and adieu to you ladies of Spain

298
00:36:26,486 --> 00:36:31,423
For we've received orders
to sail for old England

299
00:36:31,491 --> 00:36:37,657
We hope in a short time
to see you again

300
00:36:38,564 --> 00:36:42,728
What a wonderfully true voice
Mr Hollom possesses.

301
00:36:42,802 --> 00:36:45,327
Indeed.

302
00:36:46,472 --> 00:36:49,168
Come, all you bold young thoughtless men

303
00:36:49,275 --> 00:36:51,766
A warning take by me

304
00:36:51,844 --> 00:36:56,440
And never leave your happy homes
to sail the raging sea

305
00:37:08,194 --> 00:37:11,322
On deck there. Sail ho.

306
00:37:12,298 --> 00:37:14,493
Looks like a frigate.

307
00:37:19,105 --> 00:37:21,198
How did it get there?

308
00:37:21,307 --> 00:37:24,970
- We must turn and fight.
- But he has the weather gauge again.

309
00:37:25,044 --> 00:37:28,343
He must've been watching us
from some inlet.

310
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:35,845
My God. What can we do?
He has us by the hip.

311
00:37:35,955 --> 00:37:37,946
Run like smoke and oakum.

312
00:37:38,024 --> 00:37:41,960
- We'll have to bend every sail.
- We'll put up our handkerchiefs if we have to.

313
00:37:42,028 --> 00:37:45,987
We must survive this day.
Let's get about it. Mr Allen, gentlemen.

314
00:37:46,065 --> 00:37:48,124
All hands, make sail.

315
00:37:48,201 --> 00:37:53,138
This is the second time he's done this to me.
There will not be a third.

316
00:38:09,021 --> 00:38:14,755
I tell ya, the devil's at the wheel
of that there phantom ship.

317
00:38:14,861 --> 00:38:17,261
You better hold fast.

318
00:38:23,536 --> 00:38:25,697
What is it with this man?

319
00:38:25,771 --> 00:38:31,573
Did I kill a relative of his in battle, perhaps?
His boy, God forbid?

320
00:38:31,677 --> 00:38:33,702
He fights like you, Jack.

321
00:38:52,298 --> 00:38:55,233
Bring the sun down to the horizon.

322
00:38:55,301 --> 00:38:59,533
When its lower limb is touching the horizon...
Williamson, look to your sextant.

323
00:38:59,605 --> 00:39:03,473
When the orb is no longer rising,

324
00:39:03,576 --> 00:39:07,137
then it has reached its zenith
and that would be noon.

325
00:39:07,246 --> 00:39:09,612
- Sir?
- Mr Pullings.

326
00:39:09,715 --> 00:39:11,910
- Do you make noon, Mr Hollom?
- Yes, sir.

327
00:39:11,984 --> 00:39:14,475
Call noon. It's your class.

328
00:39:16,789 --> 00:39:20,156
- Sir, that's noon.
- Mr Nichols, make that twelve.

329
00:39:20,259 --> 00:39:22,591
Six hours?

330
00:39:22,662 --> 00:39:24,926
Five at most.

331
00:39:24,997 --> 00:39:28,956
Just keep us out of her reach until nightfall.

332
00:39:37,109 --> 00:39:42,012
She's to look like us, lads, don't forget.
Jibbo, make fast those whips.

333
00:39:42,114 --> 00:39:45,572
We didn't want to make it any taller,
on account of this wind.

334
00:39:45,651 --> 00:39:51,783
- Excuse me, sir, but what are they building?
- Your first command.

335
00:39:57,663 --> 00:40:00,029
Quickly. She'll be on top of us.

336
00:40:00,132 --> 00:40:03,033
Take the weight on the yard tackles.

337
00:40:03,135 --> 00:40:05,433
Fend her off.

338
00:40:05,504 --> 00:40:07,995
Lower away on the main.

339
00:40:14,981 --> 00:40:18,144
- Wouldn't want to lose you.
- Aye, sir.

340
00:40:29,228 --> 00:40:34,791
There's a painter. Pass her aft.
Outside everything, mind.

341
00:40:34,867 --> 00:40:39,167
Lively now.
We've not ten minutes before he's up with us.

342
00:40:45,344 --> 00:40:49,178
- Mind what the captain told you.
- Pull, boys. That's it.

343
00:41:12,738 --> 00:41:13,762
Now.

344
00:41:19,445 --> 00:41:22,380
Killick there. Douse your light.

345
00:41:28,788 --> 00:41:30,415
Mr Allen, make ready.

346
00:42:11,564 --> 00:42:14,055
Hello. We caught a fish.

347
00:42:15,601 --> 00:42:17,501
Take the helm, Bonden.

348
00:42:17,603 --> 00:42:21,300
- Now, tell me that wasn't fun.
- Yes, sir.

349
00:42:23,075 --> 00:42:25,771
Hard a'larboard.

350
00:42:54,673 --> 00:42:59,167
Stand the men down, Mr Pullings.
I'll take this watch.

351
00:42:59,278 --> 00:43:00,870
Aye, sir.

352
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:05,542
Mr Mowett, Mr Allen, calmly now.
You know his orders.

353
00:43:05,651 --> 00:43:07,710
Well done, sir.

354
00:43:09,522 --> 00:43:14,118
She's a right phantom, she is. The way
she come up again, right behind us like that.

355
00:43:14,193 --> 00:43:19,529
Out of nowhere. And right behind us.
Like that first time, out the fog.

356
00:43:19,632 --> 00:43:22,123
With our shot bouncin' off her.

357
00:43:22,201 --> 00:43:25,170
Captain's not called Lucky Jack for no reason.

358
00:43:25,237 --> 00:43:29,333
Phantom or no, she's a privateer,
and Lucky Jack'll have her.

359
00:43:29,408 --> 00:43:32,343
You need more than luck 'gainst a phantom.

360
00:43:34,146 --> 00:43:37,377
- Is she like a pirate?
- No, they're not pirates, Lofty.

361
00:43:37,483 --> 00:43:42,011
Oh, no. If they were,
we could hang them when we catch 'em.

362
00:43:42,087 --> 00:43:44,885
Privateer gets a piece of paper
from the Frenchies

363
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:47,652
says they can hunt down
anything with our flag.

364
00:43:47,726 --> 00:43:51,389
They go after rich merchantmen and the like.

365
00:43:51,497 --> 00:43:55,228
But think on our share of the prize money.

366
00:43:55,334 --> 00:44:00,328
She'll be loaded with gold
and ambergris and all the gems of Araby.

367
00:44:00,406 --> 00:44:03,898
That's all very well, Nagle.
Got to get home to spend it, but.

368
00:44:04,009 --> 00:44:06,341
Never met a dead man
who bought me a drink.

369
00:44:06,412 --> 00:44:10,371
And I've never met a live one
that you bought one for, neither.

370
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:17,882
Sitting up all night, catching your death
of cold. That's the last of the coffee, too.

371
00:44:17,957 --> 00:44:20,050
Thank you, Killick.

372
00:44:24,396 --> 00:44:26,421
Bonden.

373
00:44:26,532 --> 00:44:29,695
That's enough easting.
Set a course sou'-sou'west.

374
00:44:29,768 --> 00:44:33,761
Aye, sir. Sou'-sou'west.

375
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:40,278
Sail.

376
00:44:40,379 --> 00:44:43,576
Two points off starboard bow.

377
00:44:44,116 --> 00:44:46,584
Three cheers for Lucky Jack.

378
00:44:52,725 --> 00:44:55,091
She's ours, boys.

379
00:45:04,837 --> 00:45:09,001
Foul. You got away before me.

380
00:45:13,178 --> 00:45:16,147
- Set royals and courses.
- Sir.

381
00:45:16,248 --> 00:45:18,739
Have the idlers placed along the rails.

382
00:45:18,817 --> 00:45:20,785
I've never seen the like.

383
00:45:20,853 --> 00:45:24,812
It has to be more than 100 sea miles
and he brings us up on his tail.

384
00:45:24,924 --> 00:45:29,088
That's seamanship, Mr Pullings.
My God, that's seamanship.

385
00:45:29,161 --> 00:45:32,494
Told you it would work, Will.
We'll have them by nightfall.

386
00:45:32,598 --> 00:45:36,090
- I think we've got him, sir.
- And the wind favors us this time.

387
00:45:36,168 --> 00:45:39,467
Don't count your eggs
before they're in the pudding.

388
00:45:39,538 --> 00:45:44,475
Still, if we can close this gap
and get up behind her, she may well be ours.

389
00:45:44,543 --> 00:45:46,943
Touch wood. Scratch a stay.

390
00:45:47,546 --> 00:45:51,141
Turn three times.
May the Lord and saints preserve us.

391
00:46:06,632 --> 00:46:08,327
Turn.

392
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,234
Move along, man.
We'll have lost him before you rig it up.

393
00:46:12,338 --> 00:46:14,465
Hold.

394
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,835
- 12 knots, sir.
- That's 12 knots. That's good.

395
00:46:18,911 --> 00:46:23,575
I want more. Have all the spare hands
placed on the windward rail.

396
00:46:23,682 --> 00:46:26,981
Mr Hollar. Rouse up the off-watch.

397
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,253
All hands on starboard rail.

398
00:46:31,924 --> 00:46:35,325
Come up the larboard topsail sheets.

399
00:46:52,945 --> 00:46:57,405
- We're crackin' on.
- We'll be crackin' up if he don't watch it.

400
00:46:57,516 --> 00:47:02,112
Captain knows this ship.
He knows what she can take.

401
00:47:06,291 --> 00:47:10,728
Mr Hollar, I want lifelines fore and aft.

402
00:47:10,796 --> 00:47:12,525
No lounging, boy.

403
00:47:12,598 --> 00:47:18,298
Lifelines, fore and aft.
Double-grape that launch.

404
00:47:20,539 --> 00:47:22,939
Cape Horn, Doctor.

405
00:47:38,757 --> 00:47:41,749
Close the lid.
There's enough water in the grog.

406
00:47:41,827 --> 00:47:43,727
Thank you for that, Davies.

407
00:47:43,796 --> 00:47:48,665
Reckon the captain will follow him
round the Horn, every stitch of canvas flying?

408
00:47:48,767 --> 00:47:51,235
I reckon he'd follow him to the gates of hell.

409
00:47:51,303 --> 00:47:55,831
It's a devil ship, I tell ya.
And it's leadin' us right into a trap.

410
00:47:59,244 --> 00:48:02,111
She's making a run for the Horn, sir.

411
00:48:02,181 --> 00:48:05,150
I'll not vouch for this mast.
Not around the Horn.

412
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:08,276
Thank you. Your comments
will be noted in the log.

413
00:48:08,353 --> 00:48:14,622
Sail trimmers to their stations.
Get the sails off her, lads. She's over-pressed.

414
00:48:14,693 --> 00:48:16,854
Give 'em a pull and belay.

415
00:48:32,344 --> 00:48:35,836
We're closing on her, Tom.
I'll not give up now.

416
00:48:35,948 --> 00:48:39,179
Come up on the wind, Barret.
Set a course sou'west by west.

417
00:48:39,284 --> 00:48:41,878
Sou'west by west, sir.

418
00:48:43,055 --> 00:48:44,784
Mr Calamy.

419
00:48:44,857 --> 00:48:47,553
Idlers and waisters below.

420
00:48:51,363 --> 00:48:54,161
We're for the Horn, boys.

421
00:48:58,137 --> 00:49:00,071
Close reef topsails.

422
00:49:13,585 --> 00:49:15,348
Lively, lads.

423
00:49:19,658 --> 00:49:24,425
Batten down those hatches
before we're on the bottom.

424
00:49:34,006 --> 00:49:36,839
Johansson, Truelove. To the mizzen.

425
00:49:38,243 --> 00:49:40,177
All secure.

426
00:49:40,245 --> 00:49:42,213
Down ye go, lads.

427
00:49:48,687 --> 00:49:53,386
Mr Hollom, help young Warley
on the mizzen topgallant.

428
00:49:56,862 --> 00:50:00,229
- I'll need more men, sir.
- Yes. Go.

429
00:50:08,574 --> 00:50:12,271
Mr Hollom, sir. Help me.

430
00:50:19,084 --> 00:50:22,747
Tudor, Ellers. To Mr Allen.

431
00:50:22,821 --> 00:50:27,815
You men, lay aloft.
The mizzen topgallant. Light along.

432
00:50:35,767 --> 00:50:37,826
Help.

433
00:50:40,906 --> 00:50:42,931
Help me.

434
00:50:48,814 --> 00:50:51,578
Man overboard.

435
00:50:52,751 --> 00:50:57,245
Mizzen's gone. Hands to the taffrail.

436
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:11,200
He's over there, sir.

437
00:51:11,303 --> 00:51:14,966
Swim for the wreckage, man. Swim.

438
00:51:15,774 --> 00:51:17,469
Over here.

439
00:51:17,542 --> 00:51:22,844
Mr Allen, gratings and barrels,
anything that floats, overboard.

440
00:51:22,948 --> 00:51:27,044
She's broaching. We're losing her.

441
00:51:27,152 --> 00:51:30,485
Sir, the wreckage is acting as a sea anchor.

442
00:51:30,555 --> 00:51:34,116
We must cut it loose.
It's going to sink us.

443
00:51:34,192 --> 00:51:38,026
Sir, he's going to make it. He can do it.

444
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:42,157
- Come on, Will.
- Come on. Hand over hand.

445
00:51:42,234 --> 00:51:47,399
For God's sake, Will, swim.
Swim for the wreckage, Will.

446
00:51:56,048 --> 00:51:57,982
You can do it, Will.

447
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:02,214
- Swim. Come on.
- Come on, Will. Swim.

448
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:35,306
- He's been at it again.
- Who's that, then?

449
00:54:35,373 --> 00:54:38,206
- The Jonah.
- What's that?

450
00:54:48,587 --> 00:54:53,047
The deaths in actual battle
are the easiest to bear.

451
00:54:53,758 --> 00:55:00,823
For my own part, those who die under my
knife, or from some subsequent infection,

452
00:55:00,899 --> 00:55:06,838
I have to remind myself that it was
the enemy that killed them, not me.

453
00:55:09,007 --> 00:55:11,601
That young man was a casualty of war.

454
00:55:14,346 --> 00:55:18,578
As you said yourself,
you have to choose the lesser of two evils.

455
00:55:18,683 --> 00:55:20,742
Weevils.

456
00:55:24,189 --> 00:55:28,592
The crew will take it badly.
Warley was popular.

457
00:55:28,693 --> 00:55:32,754
Have they expressed
any feelings on the matter to you?

458
00:55:40,038 --> 00:55:43,064
Jack, before answering,
I'm compelled to ask,

459
00:55:43,141 --> 00:55:47,271
am I speaking with my old friend
or to the ship's captain?

460
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:51,975
To the captain I'd say
there's little I detest more than an informer.

461
00:55:52,083 --> 00:55:55,314
- Now you're talking like an Irishman.
- I am an Irishman.

462
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:57,445
As a friend, then.

463
00:55:57,556 --> 00:56:03,392
As a friend, I would say that I have never once
doubted your abilities as a captain.

464
00:56:03,461 --> 00:56:05,395
Speak plainly, Stephen.

465
00:56:07,165 --> 00:56:11,898
Perhaps we should have
turned back weeks ago.

466
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:15,838
The men, of course
they would follow Lucky Jack anywhere,

467
00:56:15,941 --> 00:56:18,171
rightfully confident of victory.

468
00:56:18,276 --> 00:56:23,908
But therein lies the problem.
You're not accustomed to defeat.

469
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:31,650
And chasing this larger, faster ship with
its long guns is beginning to smack of pride.

470
00:56:31,756 --> 00:56:35,157
It's not a question of pride.
It is a question of duty.

471
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:37,694
Duty. Yes, I've heard it well spoken of.

472
00:56:37,796 --> 00:56:42,426
Be as satiric as you like. Viewing the world
through a microscope is your prerogative.

473
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:47,028
This is a ship of war. I will grind whatever
grist the mill requires to fulfill my duty.

474
00:56:47,138 --> 00:56:49,504
Whatever the cost?

475
00:56:49,608 --> 00:56:51,838
Whatever the cost.

476
00:56:51,943 --> 00:56:54,707
To follow orders with no regard for cost.

477
00:56:54,813 --> 00:56:59,113
Can you really claim there's
nothing personal in this call to duty?

478
00:56:59,184 --> 00:57:01,675
Orders are subject
to the requirement of the service.

479
00:57:01,786 --> 00:57:08,055
My orders were to follow him as far as Brazil.
I exceeded my orders a long time ago.

480
00:57:10,295 --> 00:57:12,354
Got it.

481
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:18,892
The wind's backing, sir.

482
00:57:19,004 --> 00:57:23,031
Sir, we just can't hold
this westerly course any longer.

483
00:57:23,642 --> 00:57:29,672
If we can't sail through the damn wind, Tom,
we'll bloody well sail around it. Due south.

484
00:57:29,748 --> 00:57:32,740
How far south, sir?

485
00:57:32,851 --> 00:57:36,378
As far as is necessary, Mr Pullings.

486
00:57:36,488 --> 00:57:38,922
- Aye, sir.
- Lively.

487
00:57:40,025 --> 00:57:44,189
- Due south, please, Mr Bonden.
- Due south, sir.

488
00:57:46,731 --> 00:57:49,894
Heave. Steady.

489
00:58:25,203 --> 00:58:29,537
Clearly something nautical and fascinating
just happened. I am at a loss.

490
00:58:29,607 --> 00:58:34,101
We have made our turn northward.
We are headed back toward the sun.

491
00:58:34,212 --> 00:58:36,271
To the sun.

492
00:58:38,917 --> 00:58:42,546
And by way of anticipation of this event,

493
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:48,252
I have asked Killick
to prepare something special.

494
00:58:48,326 --> 00:58:52,626
- Killick. Killick there.
- I'm already here, ain't I?

495
00:58:55,133 --> 00:58:59,331
Gentlemen, I give you,

496
00:59:00,138 --> 00:59:02,436
our destination.

497
00:59:08,747 --> 00:59:12,478
- It's the Galapagos Islands.
- The Galapagos Islands.

498
00:59:15,086 --> 00:59:17,350
Our whaling fleet is there.

499
00:59:17,455 --> 00:59:22,916
And their cargo would put a pretty penny
into old Bones-aparte's invasion purse.

500
00:59:22,994 --> 00:59:28,694
That's where the Acheron will be.
Sure as there's carts to horses.

501
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,462
So, Mr Pullings, if you'll permit me,

502
00:59:31,536 --> 00:59:34,528
a slice of Albemarle.

503
00:59:35,507 --> 00:59:39,136
And for you, Doctor, Redondo Rock.

504
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:40,541
Perfect.

505
00:59:40,645 --> 00:59:43,375
And the Acheron for me.

506
00:59:49,554 --> 00:59:54,821
Safe and sound at home again
Let the waters roar, Jack

507
00:59:54,893 --> 00:59:59,853
Safe and sound at home again
Let the waters roar, Jack

508
00:59:59,964 --> 01:00:06,199
Long we tossed on the rolling main
Now we're safe ashore, Jack

509
01:00:06,304 --> 01:00:11,640
Don't forget your old shipmates

510
01:00:11,709 --> 01:00:17,147
We have worked the selfsame gun
Quarterdeck division

511
01:00:17,215 --> 01:00:22,881
Sponger I, and loader you
Through the whole commission

512
01:00:22,987 --> 01:00:29,358
Long we tossed on the rolling main
Now we're safe ashore, Jack

513
01:00:29,427 --> 01:00:36,697
Don't forget your old shipmates

514
01:01:20,979 --> 01:01:27,817
The Enchanted Isles. They're said
to be full of strange and wonderful beasts.

515
01:01:28,653 --> 01:01:31,747
When we get there,
we'll have to stop for food and water.

516
01:01:31,823 --> 01:01:35,782
I promise you, during that time -
several days at least -

517
01:01:35,894 --> 01:01:40,297
you can wander at will, collecting bugs
and beetles to your heart's content.

518
01:01:40,398 --> 01:01:44,892
You'll be the first naturalist
to set foot on the islands, I'll wager.

519
01:01:44,969 --> 01:01:48,336
I would like that of all things.

520
01:01:51,976 --> 01:01:55,241
- Is it an insect?
- Yes.

521
01:01:57,081 --> 01:02:01,916
Doesn't look like one.
I mean, it looks like a stick.

522
01:02:02,687 --> 01:02:05,087
Yes, that's the whole point.

523
01:02:05,156 --> 01:02:09,115
It's disguised itself in order to survive.

524
01:02:13,131 --> 01:02:17,795
There's a spider
that's disguised itself as an ant.

525
01:02:17,869 --> 01:02:25,173
And here's an insect that's taken on the shape
of a thorn to save itself from the birds.

526
01:02:26,678 --> 01:02:28,873
Did God make them change?

527
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:32,347
Does God make them change?
Yes, certainly.

528
01:02:32,450 --> 01:02:35,886
But do they also change themselves?

529
01:02:35,987 --> 01:02:38,820
Now that is a question, isn't it?

530
01:02:40,858 --> 01:02:43,520
Sir, we've raised the Galapagos.

531
01:02:43,628 --> 01:02:45,687
I'm coming.

532
01:03:20,565 --> 01:03:24,365
- Look. Beyond the rock.
- Yes, I see.

533
01:03:24,435 --> 01:03:28,098
What is it? Curious, eh?
Some type of gull?

534
01:03:28,206 --> 01:03:33,667
- There's an ugly devil.
- Disgusting. It's got warts all over it.

535
01:03:33,745 --> 01:03:36,714
Ugly devils, aren't they?

536
01:03:37,682 --> 01:03:40,344
I can't see any women.
Just ducks and lizards.

537
01:03:40,418 --> 01:03:43,353
What, no women? It ain't natural.

538
01:03:44,689 --> 01:03:46,554
How extraordinary.

539
01:03:46,624 --> 01:03:48,455
What is, sir?

540
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:52,586
Those birds. They're a species of cormorant,
but they are flightless.

541
01:03:52,697 --> 01:03:55,359
Do you see their underdeveloped wings?

542
01:03:55,433 --> 01:03:59,028
By all that's holy,
I think that's unknown to science.

543
01:03:59,103 --> 01:04:02,903
The dragons don't seem to bother them.

544
01:04:03,541 --> 01:04:07,978
They're a type of iguana, I should think.
Therefore, they're vegetarian.

545
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:11,139
- Will you catch one?
- A pair of them, I should think.

546
01:04:11,249 --> 01:04:14,446
Then you can present
one of their offspring to the king.

547
01:04:14,552 --> 01:04:18,249
- Look. There's one going for a swim.
- Iguanas don't swim.

548
01:04:18,322 --> 01:04:20,586
These ones do.

549
01:04:29,634 --> 01:04:31,761
I'll be damned.

550
01:04:31,836 --> 01:04:38,139
Two new species in as many minutes.
That's remarkable.

551
01:05:01,499 --> 01:05:06,459
All hands about ship. Off tacks and sheets.
Prepare the mainsail to haul.

552
01:05:15,713 --> 01:05:19,308
- Aubrey.
- Hogg. Master of the Albatross.

553
01:05:19,383 --> 01:05:22,841
God bless you, Captain.
God bless you all.

554
01:05:23,855 --> 01:05:26,824
- Mr Calamy, food and water for these men.
- Aye, sir.

555
01:05:26,891 --> 01:05:30,349
- Mr Howard, stand your men down.
- Royal Marines, trail arms.

556
01:05:31,229 --> 01:05:34,289
We was coming back for fresh lines
no more than a week ago.

557
01:05:34,365 --> 01:05:39,826
Hid in that inlet yonder. Burnt our bloody
ship to the waterline. Fucking pirates.

558
01:05:39,904 --> 01:05:42,202
Crew prisoner, captain dead.

559
01:05:42,306 --> 01:05:46,402
She were a big black three-master.
Break your heart, it would.

560
01:05:46,511 --> 01:05:51,710
$12,000 sterling of the finest grade oil they
took. We been out more than two years.

561
01:05:51,816 --> 01:05:53,716
And her course?

562
01:05:53,818 --> 01:05:56,981
Maybe a point south of west,
following the rest of the fleet.

563
01:05:57,054 --> 01:06:00,251
Mr Pullings, enter these men's names
into the ship's books.

564
01:06:00,358 --> 01:06:03,555
Mr Allen, set a course. West by south.

565
01:06:03,661 --> 01:06:05,891
All hands, make sail.

566
01:06:05,997 --> 01:06:09,023
Sir, should we not take on fresh provisions?

567
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:12,228
Mr Mowett, there's not a moment to lose.

568
01:06:27,385 --> 01:06:32,413
- Have you forgotten your promise?
- Subject to the requirements of the service.

569
01:06:32,523 --> 01:06:35,720
I cannot delay for the sake
of an iguana or a giant peccary.

570
01:06:35,793 --> 01:06:39,251
Fascinating, no doubt,
but of no immediate application.

571
01:06:39,363 --> 01:06:43,390
There is, I think, an opportunity here
to serve both our purposes.

572
01:06:43,467 --> 01:06:46,595
As I understand it, this is a long, thin island.

573
01:06:46,704 --> 01:06:50,231
You need to sail around it.
I could walk across it.

574
01:06:50,308 --> 01:06:54,244
I have known you to spend hours
staring into a deserted bird's nest.

575
01:06:54,312 --> 01:06:58,271
I could walk briskly, pausing only
for important measurements.

576
01:06:58,382 --> 01:07:02,546
Making discoveries that could advance
our knowledge of natural history.

577
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:06,716
If wind and tide had been against us,
I should have said yes.

578
01:07:06,791 --> 01:07:09,988
They're not. I'm obliged to say no.

579
01:07:11,662 --> 01:07:15,393
I see. So after all this time in your service,

580
01:07:15,466 --> 01:07:20,335
I must simply content myself
to form part of this belligerent expedition,

581
01:07:20,438 --> 01:07:25,432
hurry past wonders, bent on destruction.
I say nothing of the corruption of power...

582
01:07:25,509 --> 01:07:29,104
- You forget yourself, Doctor.
- No, Jack.

583
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:33,480
You've forgotten yourself. For my part,
I look upon a promise as binding.

584
01:07:33,584 --> 01:07:37,918
The promise was conditional.
I command a king's ship, not a private yacht.

585
01:07:37,989 --> 01:07:42,119
We do not have time for
your damned hobbies, sir.

586
01:08:10,054 --> 01:08:12,522
All right.

587
01:08:14,492 --> 01:08:20,055
Get those fish below.
Sluice down this deck.

588
01:08:20,164 --> 01:08:23,395
Davies, don't leave them there.
Get them below.

589
01:08:23,501 --> 01:08:25,162
Mr Blakeney.

590
01:08:25,236 --> 01:08:29,468
Sir, I found a curious beetle
walking along the deck.

591
01:08:32,677 --> 01:08:35,510
I think it's a Galapagos beetle.

592
01:08:36,547 --> 01:08:38,310
I'm sure of it.

593
01:08:39,483 --> 01:08:44,682
Were you to walk all day on the island,
you might never come across it.

594
01:08:46,857 --> 01:08:50,190
Yes, that is more than likely sure.

595
01:08:50,928 --> 01:08:53,362
You can have it, sir.

596
01:09:09,747 --> 01:09:12,341
Mr Blakeney.

597
01:09:13,551 --> 01:09:16,577
- Thank you.
- Sir.

598
01:09:30,034 --> 01:09:32,025
Last gun fired, sir.

599
01:09:32,103 --> 01:09:35,732
- Timing?
- Two minutes and one second, sir.

600
01:09:35,806 --> 01:09:41,142
Lads, that's not good enough.
We need to fire two broadsides to her one.

601
01:09:41,245 --> 01:09:44,442
- Want to see a guillotine in Piccadilly?
- No.

602
01:09:44,548 --> 01:09:47,745
- Do you want to call Napoleon your king?
- No.

603
01:09:47,818 --> 01:09:50,582
- Want your children to sing The Marseillaise?
- No.

604
01:09:50,654 --> 01:09:53,919
Mr Mowett, Mr Pullings, starboard battery.

605
01:09:56,961 --> 01:10:00,260
Jump to it, lads. Cadence and rhythm.

606
01:10:02,933 --> 01:10:06,266
- Mark your targets.
- Come on, lads, faster now.

607
01:10:06,337 --> 01:10:08,430
Come on, swab it.

608
01:10:20,251 --> 01:10:22,651
Heave.

609
01:10:22,753 --> 01:10:25,950
- Report, Mr Mowett.
- Third and fourth divisions ready.

610
01:10:26,023 --> 01:10:28,924
Right. Starboard battery, fire!

611
01:11:02,793 --> 01:11:04,988
One minute and ten seconds.

612
01:11:06,831 --> 01:11:09,493
Well done, lads.
Extra grog for all of you.

613
01:11:13,637 --> 01:11:16,071
Gangway for the captain, lads.

614
01:11:16,173 --> 01:11:18,835
Marked improvement, Mr Calamy. Well done.

615
01:11:18,909 --> 01:11:21,002
Thank you, sir.

616
01:11:27,384 --> 01:11:32,822
Killick. Killick there.
What do you have for us tonight?

617
01:11:32,890 --> 01:11:35,415
Which it's soused hog's face.

618
01:11:35,526 --> 01:11:40,190
- Which it is soused hog's face.
- My favorite.

619
01:11:40,264 --> 01:11:46,897
And when they run, the Surprise
will blow her to kingdom come.

620
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:46,627
One more week of this and
they'd give it up for a cup of water.

621
01:12:46,730 --> 01:12:48,891
I can't make it rain.

622
01:12:50,768 --> 01:12:54,295
I can harness the wind,
but I ain't its goddamn creator.

623
01:12:54,405 --> 01:12:57,067
I have never known such a run of bad luck.

624
01:13:13,424 --> 01:13:19,329
"And they said unto him
'For what caused the evil?"'

625
01:13:23,167 --> 01:13:25,499
Where'd that come from?

626
01:13:26,437 --> 01:13:31,340
It's from the Bible, that. That is
from the Bible. The story of the Jonah.

627
01:13:31,442 --> 01:13:35,310
They found out on their ship
that one of their men - this Jonah cove -

628
01:13:35,379 --> 01:13:38,439
he'd offended God
and was the cause of all their bad luck.

629
01:13:38,515 --> 01:13:44,147
Evil comes from him
who evil thinks and evil is.

630
01:13:44,221 --> 01:13:48,954
No. Joe knows a thing or two about evil.

631
01:13:49,827 --> 01:13:53,490
From personal experience. Right, Joe?

632
01:14:05,209 --> 01:14:10,647
It's like Killick says. Morning of the battle,
he doesn't have the guts to beat to quarters.

633
01:14:10,714 --> 01:14:15,344
Then his entire gun crew's killed.
Soon as he went up the mizzen, Will falls.

634
01:14:15,419 --> 01:14:19,219
And whose watch was it
when we lost our wind?

635
01:14:41,578 --> 01:14:44,206
You there. Stand fast.

636
01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:50,514
Master-at-arms, take that man below
and clap him in irons.

637
01:14:50,587 --> 01:14:54,114
Mr Pullings, defaulters at eight bells.

638
01:14:54,224 --> 01:14:55,919
Aye, sir.

639
01:14:57,361 --> 01:15:00,694
Bring Hollom down to my cabin.

640
01:15:04,702 --> 01:15:07,967
A man pushed past you,
yet you said nothing. Why?

641
01:15:08,072 --> 01:15:10,973
I intended to, sir, but the right words didn't...

642
01:15:11,075 --> 01:15:16,274
The right words?
He was deliberately insubordinate.

643
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:19,440
I've tried to get to know the men, sir,
and be friendly,

644
01:15:19,550 --> 01:15:22,986
but they've taken a set against me.

645
01:15:23,654 --> 01:15:28,489
Always whispering when I go past
and giving me looks.

646
01:15:28,592 --> 01:15:31,493
I'll set that to rights.
I'll be much tougher on them.

647
01:15:31,595 --> 01:15:35,122
You don't make friends
with the foremastjacks, lad.

648
01:15:35,232 --> 01:15:39,498
They'll despise you in the end,
think you weak.

649
01:15:39,603 --> 01:15:43,300
- Nor do you need to be a tyrant.
- No, sir.

650
01:15:43,407 --> 01:15:45,671
I'm very sorry, sir.

651
01:15:45,776 --> 01:15:49,177
- You're 26? 27?
- I'm 30 next Friday, sir.

652
01:15:49,279 --> 01:15:50,837
30?

653
01:15:50,948 --> 01:15:54,179
You've failed to pass for lieutenant twice.

654
01:15:54,284 --> 01:15:59,153
I know you have, but you're not a bad sailor.
You can't spend your life a midshipman.

655
01:15:59,256 --> 01:16:02,851
No, sir. I will try much harder, sir.

656
01:16:04,428 --> 01:16:07,829
Look, Hollom, it's leadership they want.

657
01:16:07,931 --> 01:16:09,956
Strength.

658
01:16:10,033 --> 01:16:15,494
You find that within yourself,
and you will earn their respect.

659
01:16:17,107 --> 01:16:20,668
Without respect,
true discipline goes by the board.

660
01:16:21,779 --> 01:16:24,543
Yes, sir.

661
01:16:24,648 --> 01:16:29,711
Strength, respect and discipline, sir.

662
01:16:33,657 --> 01:16:37,616
It's an unfortunate business, Hollom.

663
01:16:38,629 --> 01:16:41,462
Damned unfortunate.

664
01:16:42,199 --> 01:16:45,066
- That'll be all.
- Yes, sir.

665
01:16:48,338 --> 01:16:52,331
- I am not a flogging captain.
- Hollom is a scapegoat for all the bad luck,

666
01:16:52,409 --> 01:16:55,708
real or imagined, on this voyage.

667
01:16:55,813 --> 01:16:58,338
Mr Lamb? If you please.

668
01:16:58,415 --> 01:17:01,680
They're exhausted.
These men are exhausted.

669
01:17:01,752 --> 01:17:04,653
You've pushed them too hard.

670
01:17:04,721 --> 01:17:08,384
Stephen, I invite you
to this cabin as my friend.

671
01:17:08,492 --> 01:17:12,758
Not to criticize nor to comment
on my command.

672
01:17:12,863 --> 01:17:18,392
Shall I leave you until you're in
a more harmonious frame of mind?

673
01:17:19,670 --> 01:17:23,436
- What would you have me do?
- Tip the ship's grog over the side.

674
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:26,998
- Stop their grog?
- Nagle was drunk when he insulted Hollom.

675
01:17:27,077 --> 01:17:30,376
Stop 200 years of privilege and tradition.

676
01:17:30,447 --> 01:17:33,610
I'd rather have them three sheets to the wind
than face a mutiny.

677
01:17:33,717 --> 01:17:36,015
I'm rather understanding of mutinies.

678
01:17:36,086 --> 01:17:40,921
Men pressed from their homes, confined
for months aboard a wooden prison...

679
01:17:41,024 --> 01:17:47,793
I respect your right to disagree with me,
but I can only afford one rebel on this ship.

680
01:17:49,233 --> 01:17:53,533
I hate it when you talk of the service
in this way. It makes me so very low.

681
01:17:53,604 --> 01:17:55,367
You think I want to flog Nagle?

682
01:17:55,439 --> 01:17:59,034
A man who hacked the ropes
that sent his mate to his death?

683
01:17:59,109 --> 01:18:01,976
Under my orders?

684
01:18:02,079 --> 01:18:06,413
Do you not see? The only things that keep
this wooden world together are hard work...

685
01:18:06,483 --> 01:18:08,917
Jack, the man failed to salute.

686
01:18:08,986 --> 01:18:11,716
There's hierarchies even in nature.

687
01:18:11,788 --> 01:18:17,055
- There is no disdain in nature. There is no...
- Men must be governed.

688
01:18:17,127 --> 01:18:19,652
Often not wisely, but governed nonetheless.

689
01:18:19,763 --> 01:18:24,063
That's the excuse of every tyrant in history,
from Nero to Bonaparte.

690
01:18:24,134 --> 01:18:28,264
I, for one, am opposed to authority.
It is an egg of misery and oppression.

691
01:18:28,338 --> 01:18:32,798
You've come to the wrong shop
for anarchy, brother.

692
01:18:35,646 --> 01:18:37,477
Four.

693
01:18:38,949 --> 01:18:40,314
Five.

694
01:18:42,619 --> 01:18:44,280
Six.

695
01:18:45,522 --> 01:18:47,319
Seven.

696
01:18:48,592 --> 01:18:50,116
Eight.

697
01:18:50,827 --> 01:18:52,590
Nine.

698
01:18:54,965 --> 01:18:56,830
Ten.

699
01:18:57,935 --> 01:18:59,129
Eleven.

700
01:19:01,171 --> 01:19:03,139
Twelve.

701
01:19:06,143 --> 01:19:08,338
Cut him down.

702
01:19:32,302 --> 01:19:34,668
Not so loud.

703
01:20:28,792 --> 01:20:31,454
Put that dirk down, Boyle.

704
01:20:33,964 --> 01:20:36,558
You OK, Mr Hollom?

705
01:20:36,633 --> 01:20:39,727
- He's not ill, just dodging work as usual.
- Shut up.

706
01:20:39,803 --> 01:20:42,897
- You shut up.
- Just leave him be.

707
01:20:42,973 --> 01:20:45,965
- Have some water.
- Thank you.

708
01:20:50,213 --> 01:20:52,545
Sir, it's Mr Hollom.

709
01:20:59,656 --> 01:21:05,617
There's nothing physically wrong with him.
He thinks he's been cursed.

710
01:21:07,397 --> 01:21:11,094
Sailors can abide a great deal,
but not a Jonah.

711
01:21:11,768 --> 01:21:14,828
My God. You believe it too.

712
01:21:16,506 --> 01:21:19,964
Not everything is in your books, Stephen.

713
01:21:26,483 --> 01:21:28,417
It's him, innit?

714
01:21:30,987 --> 01:21:33,979
The Jonah.

715
01:21:34,091 --> 01:21:36,082
He's causing it.

716
01:21:38,595 --> 01:21:41,826
He's callin' it up, don't you see?

717
01:21:41,932 --> 01:21:46,596
Every time he's on watch, that ship appears.

718
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:52,702
You wait and see.

719
01:21:52,809 --> 01:21:57,803
Anytime tonight,
that ghost ship's gonna turn up.

720
01:21:58,982 --> 01:22:03,783
And it's gonna take us all with it,
straight down to the hot place.

721
01:22:24,474 --> 01:22:26,806
Mr Hollom.

722
01:22:26,877 --> 01:22:29,573
You gave me such a start.

723
01:22:32,048 --> 01:22:34,209
Are you feeling better now?

724
01:22:34,317 --> 01:22:37,844
Yes. Much better, thank you.

725
01:22:49,166 --> 01:22:53,535
The captain thinks
we'll get our wind tomorrow.

726
01:22:53,603 --> 01:22:55,696
I'm sure of it.

727
01:23:24,634 --> 01:23:28,195
You've always been very kind to me.

728
01:23:35,278 --> 01:23:37,712
Goodbye, Blakeney.

729
01:24:45,982 --> 01:24:50,783
The simple truth is, not all of us become
the men we once hoped we might be.

730
01:24:50,854 --> 01:24:53,823
But we are all God's creatures.

731
01:24:56,559 --> 01:25:00,893
If there are those among us
who thought ill of Mr Hollom,

732
01:25:01,831 --> 01:25:04,527
or spoke ill of him,

733
01:25:06,236 --> 01:25:09,865
or failed him in respect of fellowship,

734
01:25:11,141 --> 01:25:14,668
then we ask for your forgiveness, Lord.

735
01:25:14,744 --> 01:25:16,905
And we ask for his.

736
01:25:32,696 --> 01:25:35,256
God be praised. Mr Mowett?

737
01:26:00,623 --> 01:26:03,091
Avast there.

738
01:26:16,806 --> 01:26:19,934
- Doctor, have you seen the bird?
- What sort of bird?

739
01:26:20,043 --> 01:26:26,972
Some sort of albatross. Either that, or
he's a prodigious great mew. There it goes.

740
01:26:33,323 --> 01:26:37,259
There he is. My bird. Damn.

741
01:26:38,928 --> 01:26:40,896
It's circling, lads.

742
01:26:48,004 --> 01:26:49,062
Doctor?

743
01:26:49,139 --> 01:26:51,471
My God. Doctor.

744
01:26:52,909 --> 01:26:57,744
I'm so sorry, man.
The bird dropped low. I didn't see you.

745
01:27:00,450 --> 01:27:03,681
- Calamy, get Higgins.
- I'm fine, Jack.

746
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:19,998
The bullet took in a piece of shirt with it.

747
01:27:20,103 --> 01:27:25,131
Unless it's removed,
it's gonna suppurate and fester.

748
01:27:25,208 --> 01:27:27,176
Are you equal to the task?

749
01:27:27,277 --> 01:27:33,341
I'll need to read up on the doctor's books.
Study some pictures he has.

750
01:27:33,450 --> 01:27:35,350
Study some pictures?

751
01:27:35,452 --> 01:27:38,512
It's just to get my bearings, that's all.

752
01:27:38,621 --> 01:27:45,220
It'd be a lot easier if I were on dry land.
You wouldn't have the...

753
01:27:45,328 --> 01:27:47,819
I'll manage. You'll see.

754
01:28:12,255 --> 01:28:15,986
Sail on the horizon, sir. Running west.

755
01:28:16,526 --> 01:28:19,393
We're not sure, but we think it's her, sir.

756
01:28:23,333 --> 01:28:25,324
Better get...

757
01:28:26,703 --> 01:28:28,762
Goodbye, sir.

758
01:28:47,056 --> 01:28:51,117
No mistakin' it. She's the Frenchie.

759
01:28:58,701 --> 01:29:01,864
Shall we beat to quarters, sir?

760
01:29:40,276 --> 01:29:42,767
Tell me this wasn't on my account.

761
01:29:42,845 --> 01:29:47,976
No, not at all.
I just needed to stretch my legs.

762
01:29:49,686 --> 01:29:52,120
Gently there.

763
01:29:58,861 --> 01:30:02,661
Briskly now. Secure this line.

764
01:30:02,765 --> 01:30:06,030
Royal Marines posted every 20 yards, sir.

765
01:30:17,113 --> 01:30:19,673
- All set, Higgins?
- Yes, sir.

766
01:30:19,782 --> 01:30:22,182
No.

767
01:30:22,785 --> 01:30:25,777
I do this with my own hand.

768
01:30:31,227 --> 01:30:34,321
If everything is under control,
I'll just be outside.

769
01:30:34,397 --> 01:30:37,491
A spare pair of steady hands
wouldn't go amiss.

770
01:30:37,567 --> 01:30:43,062
That is, if, of course, you have
the constitution for this kind of thing.

771
01:30:43,473 --> 01:30:51,380
My dear doctor, I have been amongst
and around wounds all my life.

772
01:30:51,914 --> 01:30:54,075
Good, then.

773
01:30:54,183 --> 01:30:59,246
Put your hand on my belly,
pressing firmly when I give the word.

774
01:30:59,355 --> 01:31:02,813
Higgins, the catling, if you please.

775
01:31:10,266 --> 01:31:12,530
Padeen, please.

776
01:31:25,782 --> 01:31:28,273
The sounder, Mr Higgins.

777
01:31:29,686 --> 01:31:31,745
Swab.

778
01:31:41,798 --> 01:31:43,891
All right.

779
01:31:46,803 --> 01:31:50,068
Mr Higgins, you'll have to raise the rib.

780
01:31:52,875 --> 01:31:57,107
Take a good grip with the square retractor.

781
01:32:00,583 --> 01:32:02,778
Right in.

782
01:32:02,885 --> 01:32:04,819
And lift up.

783
01:32:04,921 --> 01:32:06,388
Lift up.

784
01:32:19,469 --> 01:32:22,063
Swab, Jack. I can't see.

785
01:32:26,442 --> 01:32:29,468
Are you all right?

786
01:32:39,455 --> 01:32:41,514
I got it.

787
01:32:53,169 --> 01:32:55,467
A tad more pressure.

788
01:33:06,315 --> 01:33:09,011
- Is that all of it?
- Aye, sir.

789
01:33:09,719 --> 01:33:11,949
She'll patch up nicely.

790
01:33:12,021 --> 01:33:13,955
Thank God I got it.

791
01:33:59,735 --> 01:34:01,566
That's good.

792
01:34:09,212 --> 01:34:11,009
Sir.

793
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:14,914
- Padeen and I have been collecting for you.
- Have you really?

794
01:34:15,017 --> 01:34:18,612
The beetles each come with a specimen
of the plant they were found on.

795
01:34:18,721 --> 01:34:21,189
Padeen, that one's got away.

796
01:34:21,257 --> 01:34:25,523
Sir, I've made a few notes,
if you want to see them.

797
01:34:41,544 --> 01:34:45,571
Mr Blakeney, it would appear that
you have the makings of a naturalist.

798
01:34:45,648 --> 01:34:52,577
Perhaps I could combine them to be
a sort of fighting naturalist, like you, sir.

799
01:34:54,757 --> 01:34:58,090
They don't combine too well, I find.

800
01:34:58,160 --> 01:34:59,218
Right.

801
01:34:59,295 --> 01:35:01,661
Should you really be getting up, sir?

802
01:35:01,764 --> 01:35:05,222
- Mr Blakeney, are you also a doctor?
- No, sir.

803
01:35:05,301 --> 01:35:08,737
No, you're not. Padeen, if you please.

804
01:35:15,177 --> 01:35:19,614
How long does the captain
intend that we stay? Do you know?

805
01:35:21,484 --> 01:35:23,952
- Oh, a week perhaps.
- A week?

806
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:28,081
- There's no great hurry.
- Mustn't we make haste for the Marquesas?

807
01:35:28,157 --> 01:35:31,092
I'm not even sure
it was the Acheron we sighted.

808
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:36,188
And if it was, she'll be well away by now.
Like looking for an honest man in parliament.

809
01:35:36,299 --> 01:35:41,430
No, we shall head home. Before peace
breaks out with France, God forbid.

810
01:35:45,041 --> 01:35:48,477
I fear you may have burdened me
with a debt I can never repay.

811
01:35:48,544 --> 01:35:53,777
Tosh. Name a shrub after me.
Something prickly and hard to eradicate.

812
01:35:53,849 --> 01:35:58,513
A shrub? Nonsense.
I'll name a great tortoise after you.

813
01:35:58,621 --> 01:36:01,385
Testudo aubreii.

814
01:36:43,065 --> 01:36:46,398
Come on, pack up your things.
We should be going.

815
01:36:46,502 --> 01:36:49,699
- Back to camp, sir?
- No, to the other side of the island.

816
01:36:49,772 --> 01:36:54,232
- But, sir, that must be at least ten miles.
- Then there's not a moment to lose.

817
01:36:54,343 --> 01:36:57,335
That's where I saw my flightless cormorant.

818
01:36:57,413 --> 01:36:59,347
Come on.

819
01:37:10,259 --> 01:37:13,228
Seven inches in length.

820
01:37:14,230 --> 01:37:16,255
Four inches wide.

821
01:37:16,365 --> 01:37:18,856
15-inches-long neck.

822
01:37:19,935 --> 01:37:24,269
Width at the widest point, six inches.

823
01:37:30,312 --> 01:37:33,873
Padeen, put the net down
and use your hands. They won't bite.

824
01:37:33,949 --> 01:37:36,213
Here's a good one.

825
01:37:37,953 --> 01:37:40,717
Pick them up carefully.

826
01:37:41,323 --> 01:37:44,224
Sir, I think we should be getting back.

827
01:37:44,293 --> 01:37:49,788
Naval discipline doesn't operate out here,
Mr Blakeney. I must find that cormorant.

828
01:37:49,899 --> 01:37:52,561
And should it indeed prove flightless,

829
01:37:52,635 --> 01:37:56,469
you can join me at the Royal Society dinner
as co-discoverer.

830
01:39:20,222 --> 01:39:21,746
Mr Blakeney.

831
01:39:36,906 --> 01:39:39,204
Sir, we must hurry.

832
01:39:41,410 --> 01:39:47,110
Padeen, you must carry him. Put those down.
Leave them. Just put everything down.

833
01:39:50,619 --> 01:39:53,383
Open the cages.

834
01:40:07,803 --> 01:40:12,706
- All hands, unmoor ship.
- Mr Allen, I'll have her on a starboard tack.

835
01:40:12,775 --> 01:40:15,972
Let's have hands to stow these tortoises.

836
01:40:16,078 --> 01:40:20,139
Barret Bonden,
put your helm hard to starboard.

837
01:40:22,218 --> 01:40:25,619
He has a head start of two hours on us
and he's bearing south.

838
01:40:25,721 --> 01:40:29,418
That can only mean King Charles Island.
He's looking for water.

839
01:40:29,491 --> 01:40:36,659
If we caught up with her, to take her,
we'd have to be bloody invisible.

840
01:40:37,900 --> 01:40:40,835
Brace the yards to starboard.

841
01:40:50,112 --> 01:40:53,240
So, Stephen, did you get to see your bird?

842
01:40:53,315 --> 01:40:57,308
No. Well, yes, but I couldn't catch one.

843
01:40:58,020 --> 01:41:00,989
My greatest discovery was your phantom.

844
01:41:01,090 --> 01:41:06,118
Indeed it was. I'm sorry you had to leave
the majority of your collection behind.

845
01:41:06,195 --> 01:41:12,191
In actual fact, Mr Blakeney and I
did make one very interesting find.

846
01:41:12,301 --> 01:41:14,963
Is that right?

847
01:41:15,037 --> 01:41:17,301
Let me guess. A stick?

848
01:41:24,446 --> 01:41:26,505
Tell him about it, Mr Blakeney.

849
01:41:26,615 --> 01:41:29,982
- It's a rare phasmid, sir.
- A phasmid?

850
01:41:30,052 --> 01:41:36,548
It's an insect that disguises itself as a stick
in order to confuse its predators.

851
01:42:28,877 --> 01:42:31,107
A nautical phasmid, Doctor.

852
01:42:31,213 --> 01:42:36,207
At least, to a hungry eye,
if one has an appetite for whalers.

853
01:42:36,285 --> 01:42:40,619
I intend to take a greater interest
in the bounty of nature from now on.

854
01:42:40,723 --> 01:42:45,251
I had no idea that a study of nature
could advance the art of naval warfare.

855
01:42:45,361 --> 01:42:47,352
I see.

856
01:42:47,429 --> 01:42:50,557
Now to pull this predator in close
and spring our trap.

857
01:42:50,632 --> 01:42:52,122
- Jack?
- Yes.

858
01:42:52,234 --> 01:42:55,067
You're the predator.

859
01:42:56,305 --> 01:43:01,402
There. Hull-down,
broad off the larboard bow.

860
01:43:01,477 --> 01:43:03,411
That's a frigate, all right.

861
01:43:03,479 --> 01:43:06,710
Damn, you've got good eyes, Barret.

862
01:43:06,782 --> 01:43:10,912
- Mr Allen. More smoke.
- Aye, sir.

863
01:43:10,986 --> 01:43:13,614
That'll bring 'em about.

864
01:43:24,466 --> 01:43:29,267
That's it, lads. Clean 'em up
so they fly straight and true.

865
01:43:31,807 --> 01:43:34,901
Let's have fresh flints in all the locks.

866
01:43:44,019 --> 01:43:48,854
Larboard battery,
unship your rear wheels.

867
01:43:53,362 --> 01:43:55,455
Drop the gun.

868
01:43:58,667 --> 01:44:02,296
- Come on, Killick, you too. Get dressed.
- Oh, God.

869
01:44:02,371 --> 01:44:05,306
- Tom?
- Our preparations are completed, sir.

870
01:44:05,374 --> 01:44:10,107
Good. Right, from now on
no "sirs," no salutes, no whistles, no bells.

871
01:44:10,179 --> 01:44:11,840
Aye, sir.

872
01:44:11,947 --> 01:44:15,542
Yes, I think we're all
finding that quite difficult.

873
01:44:16,485 --> 01:44:19,477
There'll be 30 or more whalers
locked in the Acheron's hold.

874
01:44:19,555 --> 01:44:22,956
After we board, Mr Calamy
should take a party and free them.

875
01:44:23,025 --> 01:44:26,893
- You think him ready, sir?
- Were you ready, Tom?

876
01:44:26,995 --> 01:44:29,793
- He may well turn the tide.
- Indeed, sir.

877
01:44:40,375 --> 01:44:42,639
She's taken the bait. Let's come about.

878
01:44:42,711 --> 01:44:46,738
Make a show of fleeing, panicky
and disorganized, like a whaler might.

879
01:44:46,849 --> 01:44:49,249
Present company excepted, Mr Hogg.

880
01:44:49,351 --> 01:44:51,216
Hurry up, or they'll see you.

881
01:44:51,320 --> 01:44:55,552
Eckhart, leave that. Just come up quick
and get some whaler's slops on.

882
01:45:08,737 --> 01:45:12,696
- Congratulations. Acting third lieutenant.
- Thank you.

883
01:45:12,774 --> 01:45:17,507
- I hear we're to free the whalers.
- You're to be stationed on the quarterdeck.

884
01:45:17,579 --> 01:45:20,013
I'm sorry, Will.

885
01:45:21,950 --> 01:45:27,411
Make a bad show of keeping your course.
Let her run up and luff every now and then.

886
01:45:28,223 --> 01:45:31,192
- Excuse me, sir.
- Remove your hat. We're whalers.

887
01:45:31,260 --> 01:45:35,458
Mr Calamy says I'm not
on the boarding party. I want to say...

888
01:45:35,564 --> 01:45:39,625
I know what you want to say.
And my answer is no.

889
01:45:39,735 --> 01:45:44,104
You'll lead your gun crew, then when
we board, you'll take command of the ship.

890
01:45:44,206 --> 01:45:48,575
- Do I make myself clear?
- Take command of the ship? Thank you, sir.

891
01:45:48,644 --> 01:45:51,204
- Back to your station.
- Yes, sir.

892
01:45:54,383 --> 01:45:57,580
On your right upper arm,
to tell friend from foe.

893
01:45:57,653 --> 01:46:00,281
Davies, this arm. Starboard arm.

894
01:46:00,389 --> 01:46:04,120
- Is that the arm you got or don't got?
- Less of that cheek, Davies.

895
01:46:04,226 --> 01:46:07,992
Take your neck cloths
and put them round your right upper arm.

896
01:46:08,096 --> 01:46:10,656
Make way for the captain.

897
01:46:12,067 --> 01:46:14,126
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

898
01:46:14,236 --> 01:46:15,760
Right, lads.

899
01:46:15,837 --> 01:46:18,169
I know there's not a faint heart among you,

900
01:46:18,273 --> 01:46:22,073
and I know you're as anxious as I am
to get into close action.

901
01:46:22,144 --> 01:46:25,739
But we must bring him right up beside us
before we spring this trap.

902
01:46:25,814 --> 01:46:27,805
That will test our nerve.

903
01:46:27,916 --> 01:46:31,977
And discipline will count
just as much as courage.

904
01:46:32,087 --> 01:46:37,491
The Acheron is a tough nut to crack.
More than twice our guns and numbers.

905
01:46:37,593 --> 01:46:40,824
And they will sell their lives dearly.

906
01:46:42,664 --> 01:46:46,930
Topmen, your handling of the sheets
to be lubberly and un-navylike,

907
01:46:47,002 --> 01:46:49,664
until the signal
to spill the wind from our sails.

908
01:46:49,771 --> 01:46:53,172
This will bring us almost to a complete stop.

909
01:46:53,275 --> 01:46:56,870
Gun crews, you must run out and tie down
in double-quick time.

910
01:46:56,979 --> 01:47:02,281
With the rear wheels removed you've gained
elevation, but without recoil you can't reload.

911
01:47:02,351 --> 01:47:07,653
So, gun captains, that gives you one shot
from the larboard battery. One shot only.

912
01:47:07,723 --> 01:47:12,524
You'll fire for her mainmast.
Much will depend on your accuracy.

913
01:47:12,628 --> 01:47:20,967
However, even crippled she will still
be dangerous, like a wounded beast.

914
01:47:21,903 --> 01:47:23,962
Captain Howard and the marines

915
01:47:24,039 --> 01:47:28,339
will sweep their weather deck with swivel gun
and musket fire from the tops.

916
01:47:28,410 --> 01:47:31,470
They'll try and even the odds for us
before we board.

917
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:36,809
They mean to take us as a prize.

918
01:47:36,885 --> 01:47:43,586
And we are worth more to them undamaged.
Their greed will be their downfall.

919
01:47:45,427 --> 01:47:48,260
England is under threat of invasion.

920
01:47:48,363 --> 01:47:52,527
And though we be on the far side
of the world, this ship is our home.

921
01:47:54,169 --> 01:47:57,036
This ship is England.

922
01:48:00,175 --> 01:48:04,703
So it's every hand to his rope or gun.
Quick's the word and sharp's the action.

923
01:48:04,780 --> 01:48:08,216
After all, surprise is on our side.

924
01:48:19,695 --> 01:48:22,596
- Toss them high so they can see them.
- Hello, Doctor.

925
01:48:22,698 --> 01:48:24,063
Jack.

926
01:48:24,132 --> 01:48:26,396
- Care for a cigar?
- Thank you, no.

927
01:48:26,468 --> 01:48:29,062
If you please, Doctor.

928
01:48:30,472 --> 01:48:33,737
- I took the liberty, Doctor.
- Thank you, Killick.

929
01:48:33,809 --> 01:48:38,473
- There's three lumps in there.
- How kind.

930
01:49:33,268 --> 01:49:35,759
- Good luck, Will.
- Good luck, Peter.

931
01:49:37,539 --> 01:49:41,100
- See you afterwards.
- And you.

932
01:49:42,144 --> 01:49:45,773
Steady now, lads. Keep calm.

933
01:49:48,216 --> 01:49:51,811
English whaler Syren, this is Acheron.

934
01:49:51,887 --> 01:49:53,548
- Barret.
- Sir.

935
01:49:53,655 --> 01:49:58,456
You have no possibility, no chance.
But you have had warning.

936
01:49:58,527 --> 01:50:01,985
Stop now, or we will destroy your ship.

937
01:50:02,063 --> 01:50:05,499
English whaler, this is your last warning.

938
01:50:05,567 --> 01:50:09,867
Stop now, or we will destroy you.

939
01:50:09,971 --> 01:50:12,201
Let fly!

940
01:50:14,176 --> 01:50:17,976
Haul your yards there.

941
01:50:19,314 --> 01:50:21,475
Run out, boys.

942
01:50:21,550 --> 01:50:22,710
Fire!

943
01:50:23,919 --> 01:50:25,716
Fire!

944
01:50:34,596 --> 01:50:37,258
For the mainmast, lads.

945
01:50:44,239 --> 01:50:46,707
- Let me through.
- Fire!

946
01:51:14,302 --> 01:51:16,395
Hard a-larboard.

947
01:51:17,105 --> 01:51:19,630
Right the headsails. Set the topsails.

948
01:51:19,741 --> 01:51:21,038
Heave.

949
01:51:22,110 --> 01:51:24,977
Man the starboard battery.

950
01:51:31,119 --> 01:51:33,485
Fire as she bears.

951
01:51:53,975 --> 01:51:56,944
Get to it.

952
01:51:57,012 --> 01:51:59,640
It's the fallen mast. We can't lay alongside.

953
01:51:59,748 --> 01:52:02,774
Cross the wreckage as best you can.
I'll draw their fire.

954
01:52:02,851 --> 01:52:06,810
- My division to join Mr Pullings.
- Clew up topsails.

955
01:52:06,922 --> 01:52:09,914
Huzzah for Lucky Jack.

956
01:52:09,991 --> 01:52:12,619
Grappling hooks away.

957
01:52:12,694 --> 01:52:15,128
Run out the boarding planks.

958
01:52:17,265 --> 01:52:22,430
- My division, follow me.
- For England, for home, and for the prize.

959
01:52:23,038 --> 01:52:25,632
Here we go, lads.

960
01:52:29,811 --> 01:52:31,870
Pipe down. Silence.

961
01:52:54,669 --> 01:52:56,660
Looks like the job is done, sir.

962
01:52:56,738 --> 01:52:58,501
Acheron.

963
01:53:12,821 --> 01:53:14,015
Fire!

964
01:53:30,739 --> 01:53:33,105
Mr Blakeney, the nine-pounder.

965
01:53:33,208 --> 01:53:35,073
That's it.

966
01:53:35,176 --> 01:53:36,234
Fire!

967
01:53:37,545 --> 01:53:39,843
Keep moving, men. Keep moving.

968
01:54:28,963 --> 01:54:30,828
Joe.

969
01:54:36,738 --> 01:54:38,330
Grenades, ready.

970
01:54:48,516 --> 01:54:51,485
They're aiming for our hull.

971
01:54:51,586 --> 01:54:54,248
They could sink us. Depress the muzzle.

972
01:54:54,322 --> 01:54:56,347
Padeen, train it aft.

973
01:54:56,458 --> 01:54:58,119
Together now.

974
01:54:59,027 --> 01:55:01,188
Stand clear.

975
01:55:01,262 --> 01:55:03,025
Fire!

976
01:55:03,932 --> 01:55:06,332
Arm yourselves. We must board them.

977
01:55:07,702 --> 01:55:09,795
Follow me.

978
01:55:25,220 --> 01:55:26,983
Now.

979
01:55:31,659 --> 01:55:35,789
Whalers, follow me.
Mr Hogg, down below. Quickly now.

980
01:55:38,233 --> 01:55:42,033
Albatrosses. Albatrosses, do you hear me?

981
01:55:43,004 --> 01:55:45,029
To the guns.

982
01:55:48,643 --> 01:55:50,975
Boyle, douse that gun's priming.

983
01:56:26,181 --> 01:56:29,173
Lively there. Come on. Move.

984
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:35,382
Now do your worst.

985
01:57:06,754 --> 01:57:08,722
- Mr Howard.
- Sir.

986
01:57:08,790 --> 01:57:11,418
- Have they struck their colors?
- I believe so.

987
01:57:11,492 --> 01:57:15,155
- Has their captain been sighted?
- Not yet, sir.

988
01:57:15,263 --> 01:57:17,254
- Carry on.
- Aye, sir.

989
01:58:19,127 --> 01:58:21,527
Docteur de Vigny, monsieur.

990
01:58:21,629 --> 01:58:24,393
I did what I could for him.

991
01:58:29,504 --> 01:58:33,634
Before the capitaine died,
he said I was to give you this.

992
02:00:03,631 --> 02:00:06,600
No. I'll do it.

993
02:00:20,314 --> 02:00:22,748
Can you help me?

994
02:00:46,607 --> 02:00:48,438
Our Father,

995
02:00:48,509 --> 02:00:52,536
who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

996
02:00:52,647 --> 02:00:56,515
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done,

997
02:00:56,617 --> 02:00:58,983
on earth as it is in heaven.

998
02:00:59,654 --> 02:01:02,384
Give us this day our daily bread,

999
02:01:02,490 --> 02:01:07,393
and forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who trespass against us.

1000
02:01:07,495 --> 02:01:11,556
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

1001
02:01:11,666 --> 02:01:13,634
For thine is the kingdom,

1002
02:01:13,701 --> 02:01:15,726
the power and the glory,

1003
02:01:15,837 --> 02:01:17,896
forever and ever.

1004
02:01:18,005 --> 02:01:19,529
Amen.

1005
02:01:20,174 --> 02:01:23,632
Robert Gardner, able seaman.

1006
02:01:23,711 --> 02:01:27,545
James Lloyd, boatswain's mate.

1007
02:01:27,648 --> 02:01:30,674
Robert Kemp, able seaman.

1008
02:01:31,886 --> 02:01:35,822
John Antonio, quartermaster's mate.

1009
02:01:37,058 --> 02:01:41,017
Michael Doudle, able seaman.

1010
02:01:42,530 --> 02:01:46,193
Joseph Nagle, carpenter's mate.

1011
02:01:47,835 --> 02:01:51,066
John Allen, sailing master.

1012
02:01:56,577 --> 02:01:58,568
Peter Miles Calamy,

1013
02:02:03,284 --> 02:02:05,548
lieutenant.

1014
02:02:07,955 --> 02:02:11,220
We therefore commit
their bodies to the deep,

1015
02:02:11,292 --> 02:02:13,453
to be turned into corruption,

1016
02:02:13,561 --> 02:02:17,395
looking for the resurrection of the body
when the sea shall give up her dead,

1017
02:02:17,465 --> 02:02:20,366
and the life of the world to come,

1018
02:02:20,434 --> 02:02:23,767
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

1019
02:02:23,871 --> 02:02:25,930
Amen.

1020
02:02:54,802 --> 02:02:57,100
It's our old friend.

1021
02:03:51,492 --> 02:03:54,484
Pass down a barrel of paint, please.

1022
02:04:01,002 --> 02:04:05,166
Sir, the whalers are all aboard
and that's the last detachment of marines.

1023
02:04:05,239 --> 02:04:06,866
Good.

1024
02:04:06,974 --> 02:04:09,738
I think I shall return to the Galapagos.

1025
02:04:09,844 --> 02:04:13,575
Take on food and water and give
the doctor a few days to find his bird.

1026
02:04:13,681 --> 02:04:14,875
Very good, sir.

1027
02:04:14,982 --> 02:04:18,418
You, however,
shall take the Acheron south to Valparaiso.

1028
02:04:18,519 --> 02:04:23,718
Parole the prisoners there, refit as necessary,
and we shall rendezvous in Portsmouth.

1029
02:04:23,824 --> 02:04:26,850
I believe Mr Hogg
would be a good choice for sailing master.

1030
02:04:26,927 --> 02:04:31,694
However, that will be your decision,
Captain Pullings.

1031
02:04:36,604 --> 02:04:38,697
Your orders.

1032
02:04:42,510 --> 02:04:45,240
- Thank you, sir.
- Godspeed, Tom.

1033
02:04:45,346 --> 02:04:47,337
And to you, sir.

1034
02:04:53,087 --> 02:04:55,055
- Mr Mowett?
- With pleasure, sir.

1035
02:04:55,122 --> 02:04:57,784
- Good luck.
- See you in Portsmouth.

1036
02:04:57,892 --> 02:05:01,384
Now, lads, huzzah for Captain Pullings.

1037
02:05:09,036 --> 02:05:12,767
- Good luck, sir.
- Good luck, Captain.

1038
02:05:28,789 --> 02:05:30,723
Here we go again.

1039
02:05:30,791 --> 02:05:33,259
Killick. Killick there.

1040
02:05:33,327 --> 02:05:36,125
Which it will be ready when it's ready.

1041
02:05:41,669 --> 02:05:44,604
I'll rest easier when I know
they've reached shore.

1042
02:05:44,672 --> 02:05:49,974
So many wounded, and only that poor
unfortunate Higgins to tend to them.

1043
02:05:50,077 --> 02:05:53,740
Still, he's better than no doctor at all.

1044
02:05:53,814 --> 02:05:58,615
- I met their doctor. I spoke to him.
- No, he died of fever months ago.

1045
02:05:58,686 --> 02:06:01,280
De Vigny?

1046
02:06:12,800 --> 02:06:16,600
- Pass the word for Mr Mowett.
- Mr Mowett to the great cabin.

1047
02:06:16,670 --> 02:06:19,696
Their "doctor" gave me this sword.

1048
02:06:20,674 --> 02:06:21,868
Sir.

1049
02:06:21,976 --> 02:06:25,002
Mr Mowett, change of course.
Southeast by east.

1050
02:06:25,112 --> 02:06:28,604
We'll intercept the Acheron
and escort them into Valparaiso.

1051
02:06:28,682 --> 02:06:31,549
Aye, sir. Sou'east by east.

1052
02:06:32,620 --> 02:06:35,350
- And William.
- Sir?

1053
02:06:35,456 --> 02:06:38,186
- Beat to quarters.
- Very good, sir.

1054
02:06:43,230 --> 02:06:46,688
Subject to the requirements of the service.

1055
02:06:54,141 --> 02:06:57,474
Well, Stephen, the bird's flightless?

1056
02:06:57,545 --> 02:06:58,637
Yes.

1057
02:06:59,713 --> 02:07:02,375
It's not going anywhere.

1058
