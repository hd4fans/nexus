22
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:47,911

What is it?

23
00:05:49,984 --> 00:05:52,612
右舷22度半浓雾中有东西
Two points off the starboard bow, in the fog bank.

25
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:59,316
-我不知道  -该击鼓备战吗?
-I don't know what it was. -Should we beat to quarters?

26
00:06:06,601 --> 00:06:10,970
-我不确定  -你可是值星官
-I can't be certain. -You're officer of the watch.

27
00:06:11,072 --> 00:06:14,064
哈伦  你要做决定
Hollom, you must make a decision.

28

-Did you see it, Mr Calamy? -No, sir.

61
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:07,072
比尔
Bill.

62
00:10:07,175 --> 00:10:10,042
别拿剑  下去
Leave the swords. Get the captain's silver below.

63
00:10:10,144 --> 00:10:14,171
还没进入射程  等到接近了再开炮
She's not in range yet. Stand fast till she's close enough.

64
00:10:14,248 --> 00:10:18,082
-再靠近一点  -遵命
-Close with him amidships. -Midships it is, sir.

65
00:10:18,753 --> 00:10:21,085
千万别弄掉了
For God's sake, don't drop anything.

66
00:10:26,394 --> 00:10:27,588
稳住
Steady.

67
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:31,222
-坚守岗位  -坚守岗位  勇敢一点

你受伤了长官  戴维斯  杰米  把他带下去
Mr Pullings, sir. Davies, Jemmy, get Mr Pullings below.

70
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:42,903
是  长官
Aye, sir.

71
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,535
布雷克尼  通知船长
Mr Blakeney, pass the word for the captain.

72
00:10:45,613 --> 00:10:48,377
赶快清理
Clear the forward pin rails.

73
00:10:54,789 --> 00:10:56,416
沙子多洒一点
More sand on the floor.

74
00:10:58,025 --> 00:11:00,084
乘着浪头  开炮
On the up-roll, fire!

75
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:14,768
趴下
Down!

76
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:28,279

-Keep 'em spitting, Mr Calamy. -Aye, sir. Reload and give 'em hell.

78
00:11:59,341 --> 00:12:01,571
"地狱号"

79
00:12:01,656 --> 00:12:03,954
船长  快到船尾
Sir. To the taffrail.

80
00:12:10,498 --> 00:12:13,592
方向舵损坏  无法掌舵
The rudder's shot away. The steering don't answer.

81
00:12:13,668 --> 00:12:15,966
我们成了瓮中之鳖
We're fish in a barrel.

82
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,542
怎么不开炮?
Why are we not firing?

83
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:31,507
让我过去
Let me through.

84
00:12:31,619 --> 00:12:34,110
这儿  乔
Here, Joe.

85
00:12:34,188 --> 00:12:36,281
快塞住
Hold it in there.

86
00:12:40,728 --> 00:12:45,722
-他在左船首  -拿出手枪
-He's on the larboard bow, sir. -Bring up your small arms.

87
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:51,327
准备抗敌登船
Prepare to repel boarders.

88
00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:54,568
拿了枪  等船长下令
Seize your weapons and wait for the word.

89
00:12:56,677 --> 00:12:59,009
请下令
Your orders, sir?

90
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:04,350
叫炮兵到甲板船尾绑绳索  下去划小艇
Call the gun crews to deck. Rig man-ropes over the stern and pull the boats in.

91
00:13:04,418 --> 00:13:07,012
把船拖进浓雾
Put us in that fog, Tom.

92
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:20,524
用力划拼命划  大家一起划
Pull together, men.

93
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:22,728
划进浓雾
Pull for the fog bank.

94
00:13:24,105 --> 00:13:26,665
大炮搬过来
Run 'em out.

95
00:13:31,045 --> 00:13:32,706
开炮
Fire!

96
00:13:34,015 --> 00:13:38,042
船身破裂  快塞住缺口
She's opened up a seam. We need to get some oakum and pound it in.

97
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:40,883
拿槌子和铁条
Joe, a mallet and some irons.

98
00:13:46,794 --> 00:13:49,024
它追上来了
She's gaining on us.

99
00:13:56,137 --> 00:14:00,073
-我们快要摆脱了  -快划呀
-We're nearly there, boys. -Pull.

100
00:14:00,141 --> 00:14:03,372
-用力划呀  -进了那团雾就好了
-Reach for it, men. -We're home inside that fog.

101
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:09,446
开炮
Fire!

102
00:14:11,052 --> 00:14:13,953
为杰克船长用力划
Pull for Lucky Jack.

103
00:14:14,055 --> 00:14:16,216
成功了
We've done it.

104
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:21,392
不要出声
Pipe down. Silence on deck.

105
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:34,433
他们不会找到我们
They'll not find us in here.

106
00:14:34,508 --> 00:14:38,137
安静  不准大喊大叫
Quiet, lads. No shouts, no calls.

107
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,335
不要划了
Avast rowing.

108
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:13,678
干得好  各位
Well done, lads.

109
00:15:37,705 --> 00:15:41,038
水只淹到两英尺六英寸  就停了
Two feet six inches, sir, and holding.

110
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:47,408
-干得好  拉姆  -谢谢
-Good work, Mr Lamb. -Thank you, sir.

111
00:15:57,992 --> 00:16:00,153
有多少人伤亡?
So, what's the butcher's bill?

112
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:02,821
9人阵亡  27人受伤
Nine dead, 27 wounded.

113
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:13,539
乔・普雷斯
Joe Plaice.

114
00:16:13,607 --> 00:16:16,452
他的头骨破裂  很严重
He has a severely depressed fracture of the skull. 

115
00:16:16,453 --> 00:16:18,943
恐怕撑不过今晚
I don't think he'll see out the night.

116
00:16:19,046 --> 00:16:21,844
布雷克尼勋爵
Lord Blakeney.

117
00:16:24,218 --> 00:16:26,516
我只是断了只手臂
Just a broken arm, sir.

118
00:16:27,788 --> 00:16:30,757
你不用担心
You're in very good hands.

119
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:39,057
你跟他父亲是好朋友  我会尽力而为
I'm doing everything I can. I know you were close to his father.

120
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:43,536
他父亲一定会谅解  他的母亲就...
His father would've understood. He knew the life. His mother, however...

121
00:16:43,604 --> 00:16:47,096
我看看你的伤口
Let me take a look at that brow of yours.

122
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,073
什么?
What?

123
00:16:53,814 --> 00:16:56,908
他很厉害  突然冒出来进行偷袭
Damn, he was good. Just came out of nowhere.

124
00:16:56,984 --> 00:17:02,115
先开炮来个下马威  然后攻击船尾把方向舵打断
Hit us with a full broadside, cut across our tail and took out our rudder.

125
00:17:02,223 --> 00:17:04,453
对方的炮兵神准
Damn fine gunnery.

126
00:17:05,426 --> 00:17:10,090
起浓雾我们才能脱身  运气真好
We only slipped away because of the fog. Quite fortunate, really.

127
00:17:10,164 --> 00:17:14,931
他有上风优势  我有老天保佑
He may have had the weather gauge, but we had the weather gods.

128
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:19,471
我不太明白你在说什么  
I have no idea what it is you're talking about, 

129
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:21,806
不过他是蛮厉害的
but he did seem to come off rather well.

130
00:17:22,743 --> 00:17:28,079
我们航行了七个礼拜  他却知道在哪里偷袭我们
Seven weeks sailing, and he happens in darkness on our exact position.

131
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:34,581
法军在英国和各地都有间谍  我们也一样
The French have their spies in England and elsewhere. As do we.

132
00:17:35,189 --> 00:17:37,089
没错
Indeed.

133
00:17:38,292 --> 00:17:44,356
他若知道我们在找他  就该闪避
If he knew we were looking for him, he could have stood to sea and passed well clear.

134
00:17:44,465 --> 00:17:47,628
也许他也在找我们
Well then, perhaps he was looking for us.

135
00:18:04,439 --> 00:18:06,498
暗礁

136
00:18:09,344 --> 00:18:11,778
暗沙

137
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:16,352
它不是护卫舰才有鬼
If she was a frigate, then I am a Dutchman.

138
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:19,398
敌强我弱  输了并不丢脸
It was an unfair match. There was no dishonor in it.

139
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,730
它是艘二重甲板船
She was more like a ship of the line.

140
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:25,168
你会不禁对它的船身感到惊讶
You have to wonder about her hull. Our shots wouldn't penetrate.

141
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:27,867
从两百码外开炮都伤不了它
Triple-shotted at 200 yards -no effect.

142
00:18:27,975 --> 00:18:31,706
它有上风优势和猛烈的炮火优势
She had the weather gauge and a clear advantage in firepower.

143
00:18:31,812 --> 00:18:34,372
什么是上风优势?
What is the weather gauge?

144
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:38,008
-你要我画给你看吗?  -别在桌布上乱画
-Shall I show you again, Stephen? -Not on the cloth.

145
00:18:40,087 --> 00:18:44,217
它的位置在上风处  所以能左右战局
It means she had the wind in her favor, therefore control of the engagement.

146
00:18:44,325 --> 00:18:47,658
它的大炮也射得比我们远
And she had longer guns, so she could hit us beyond our range.

147
00:18:47,728 --> 00:18:51,391
承认吧  我们一败涂地
The simple fact is we were soundly beaten.

148
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:58,931
-拿破仑在太平洋部署重型护卫舰  -这样一来他就稳操胜算
-Heavy frigate like that in the Pacific... -Could tip the war in Napoleon's favor.

149
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:04,569
跟这艘军舰比起来  "惊奇号" 太老了
By comparison, the Surprise is a somewhat aged man-of-war.

150
00:19:08,282 --> 00:19:13,083
-我说错了吗?  -你说我老了吗?
-Am I not correct? -Would you call me an aged man of war?

151
00:19:13,187 --> 00:19:16,520
"惊奇号" 并不老  一点都不老
The Surprise is not old. No one would call her old.

152
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:22,756
它的船首方正船身线条优美  船坚炮利  迅速敏捷
She has a bluff bow, lovely lines. She's a fine sea boat, weatherly, stiff and fast.

153
00:19:22,863 --> 00:19:26,230
看是谁操纵了  可以非常快
Very fast, if she's well-handled.

154
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,427
它一点都不老
No, she's not old.

155
00:19:29,737 --> 00:19:31,762
它正值黄金年华
She's in her prime.

156
00:19:31,872 --> 00:19:36,434
主桅和后帆需要修复  前桅帆破裂  要用备用帆
We can patch up the main and mizzen. Foresail's gone, so we'll bend our spare.

157
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:40,604
拉姆认为只要稍作修补  我们就能安全返航
Mr Lamb is confident with basic repairs. We can get home as we are.

158
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:43,547
我们还不回去
We're not going home.

159
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:56,623
修船一定要靠岸  "地狱号" 可能还在找我们
But to refit we need a port, and the Acheron may be still looking for us.

160
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:01,064
我们可以在海上修船  这儿有暗沙的浅水海域
We can refit at sea. Here, where it shoals.

161
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:07,002
地狱号要到南太平洋开战  我们必须阻止它
As you said, she is taking the war to the South Seas. We are supposed to stop her.

162
00:20:07,107 --> 00:20:14,343
但是请恕我直言  它的实力比我们强太多了
But, sir...with respect...she's a vastly heavier ship. She's out of our class.

163
00:20:15,282 --> 00:20:18,979
等我们修好船它都到合恩角了
She could be halfway to Cape Horn by the time we're repaired.

164
00:20:19,086 --> 00:20:22,783
那就更不能浪费时间
Well then, there's not a moment to lose.

165
00:20:41,175 --> 00:20:44,338
最后一针是穿过鼻孔吗?
Is it true they put the last stitch through your nose?

166
00:20:44,445 --> 00:20:46,504
什么意思?
What do you mean?

167
00:20:47,548 --> 00:20:49,513
乔说  你死后  
Joe said when you die, 

168
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:52,884
他们会在你鼻孔上面缝一针
they stitch you in your hammock with the last stitch in your nose,

169
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:56,183
确定你不是在睡觉
just to make sure you're not asleep.

170
00:20:59,827 --> 00:21:03,285
别缝我的鼻孔好不好?
Not through the nose. You'll tell them?

171
00:21:59,953 --> 00:22:04,447
没关系鸦片酊能止痛
It's all right. It's just the laudanum speaking.

172
00:22:38,058 --> 00:22:40,822
你是最勇敢的病人
I've never seen a braver patient.

173
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:49,727
放心  我很快会把你修好
Poor darling. Never mind, soon have you fixed up.

174
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:51,771
快去工作
I want good work now.

175
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:56,332
两个人去修补前桅板  罗伯茨  查德威克
I'll need two men into the starboard forechannels. Roberts, Chadwick.

176
00:22:56,443 --> 00:22:58,502
做得很好
That's nice work there.

177
00:22:58,612 --> 00:23:01,911
这修不好的  这些给我更换掉
Repair won't do here. I need these replaced.

178
00:23:08,622 --> 00:23:11,955
科勒米  你一定有兴趣
Mr Calamy. There's something might interest you here.

179
00:23:12,025 --> 00:23:16,621
你看  这是船长当见习官时刻的
Look. The captain carved that. When he was a mid, no more than your age.

180
00:23:16,697 --> 00:23:18,597
他从小就待在这艘船上
He's known this ship man and boy.

181
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:21,883
这艘船上流了太多他的血  
He says there's enough of his blood in the woodwork 

182
00:23:21,884 --> 00:23:23,864
几乎算是他的亲人
for the ship to almost be a relation.

183
00:23:23,971 --> 00:23:28,203
我同意你的说法  你真是知识渊博
I do understand your point. Your knowledge is beyond question.

184
00:23:28,308 --> 00:23:32,210
但是如果现在才去找木材  
However, a week in the Brazilian rain forest 

185
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:33,712
一定来不及
looking for a new mast simply will not do.

186
00:23:33,814 --> 00:23:36,044
"地狱号" 早就到中国了
The Acheron will be halfway to China.

187
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:41,883
拉姆会尽全力抢修船身  大家都要跟他一样
Mr Lamb, as always, will do his best. Which is all I can hope to expect from any man.

188
00:24:15,922 --> 00:24:17,719
那是他的脑浆吗?
Is them his brains?

189
00:24:17,824 --> 00:24:21,692
不这是血浆  这才是他的大脑
No, that's just dried blood. Those are his brains.

190
00:24:27,034 --> 00:24:30,367
他可是妙手回春的医生
Physician, he is. Ain't one of your common surgeons.

191
00:24:30,437 --> 00:24:33,600
把硬币给我
-Can I have the coin, please? -Sir.

192
00:24:38,345 --> 00:24:41,075
他在陆地上不轻易替人看病
He wouldn't look at you for under ten guineas on land.

193
00:24:41,181 --> 00:24:43,342
他也很了解鸟兽习性
And he knows his birds and beasts.

194
00:24:43,417 --> 00:24:46,784
他连甲虫在想什么都知道
You show him a beetle and he'll tell you what it's thinking.

195
00:24:46,887 --> 00:24:50,414
回去做事吧懒虫  吹哨子
Back to work, you loafers. Eckhart, use your pipe.

196
00:24:50,524 --> 00:24:52,924
赶快回去做事
Let's get on with it, gentlemen.

197
00:24:53,026 --> 00:24:56,792
别净在这儿打混
You're not a pennyweight of use gawpin' here.

198
00:25:03,403 --> 00:25:05,963
他还是没开口
Still hasn't said a word, sir.

199
00:25:11,411 --> 00:25:14,403
布雷克尼勋爵  好点吗?
Lord Blakeney. Feeling better?

200
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:16,574
好多了  谢谢
Much better, thank you, sir.

201
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,743
那就好
Well, good. Good.

202
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:24,750
医生说你很爱看书  所以我...
The doctor told me you were fond of reading, so I...

203
00:25:26,948 --> 00:25:30,907
《纳尔逊将军的胜仗》

204
00:25:30,997 --> 00:25:34,489
有他打的胜仗和很棒的插图
It has all of his major battles and some fine illustrations.

205
00:25:34,601 --> 00:25:36,501
谢谢你  船长
Thank you, sir.

206
00:25:37,738 --> 00:25:40,298
你见过纳尔逊将军吗?
Did you ever meet Lord Nelson, sir?

207
00:25:40,407 --> 00:25:44,104
我为他打过尼罗河战役  伟大的胜仗
I had the honor of serving with him. At the Nile. A great victory.

208
00:25:44,177 --> 00:25:50,275
这本书上有记载  如果我没记错是第135页
You can find it in here, actually. Page 135, if I'm not mistaken.

209
00:25:51,685 --> 00:25:53,585
是的
Yes.

210
00:25:59,493 --> 00:26:03,361
他是个什么样的人?
May I beg you to tell me what kind of man he is?

211
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:07,590
你只要看书就知道
You should read the book.

212
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:10,261
我会的  谢谢
I will, sir. Thank you.

213
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:36,054
他们又在拉了  叽叽嘎嘎
Here we go again. Scrape-scrape, screech-screech.

214
00:26:36,163 --> 00:26:40,065
没有一首能跳舞  喝得烂醉了也不行
Never a tune you could dance to, not if you were drunk as Davy's sow.

215
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:51,807
这样如何?
How about this?

216
00:26:51,878 --> 00:26:56,338
你想来首激昂的曲子吗?
Or are you in the mood for something more aggressive?

217
00:28:05,006 --> 00:28:07,531
"挚爱的苏菲..."

218
00:28:09,723 --> 00:28:11,884
敬礼
Salute.

219
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:13,892
脱帽
Hats off.

220
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:18,223
什么事?
What's all this about?

221
00:28:20,967 --> 00:28:24,300
-这是什么?  -那艘鬼船
-What's this? -It's the phantom, sir.

222
00:28:24,404 --> 00:28:28,170
大家都说 "地狱号" 是鬼船
Excuse me. That's what the men call it. It's the Acheron, sir.

223
00:28:28,275 --> 00:28:31,176
他看到它的建造过程
You see, Will here, he seen her being built.

224
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:36,443
在波士顿  在战前  它是美国佬建造的
In Boston, sir. During the peace. But she's Yankee-built, sir.

225
00:28:36,516 --> 00:28:40,452
他在那里结婚  他妻子的表弟在船坞工作
He was getting married, and his wife's second cousin works in the yards,

226
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,784
带他看过那艘船
so Will here saw the ship out of water.

227
00:28:42,856 --> 00:28:48,123
我看到那艘船有点古怪  所以就请乔...
Sir, I saw there was something right strange about her, so I asked Joe...

228
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:51,493
我照他说的做了模型
So he described it to me and I knocked you up a model, sir.

229
00:28:51,598 --> 00:28:56,331
-这个模型很准确?  -完全准确
-And this framing is accurate? -Exactly accurate, sir.

230
00:28:56,436 --> 00:28:58,996
-谢谢两位  -谢谢
-Thank you, lads. -Thank you, sir.

231
00:28:59,105 --> 00:29:02,336
多给他们一份朗姆酒
Killick, an extra ration of rum for these men.

232
00:29:02,442 --> 00:29:04,842
谢谢船长
Thank you very much, sir.

233
00:29:04,945 --> 00:29:07,937
-那是留着过节喝的  -过节喝葡萄酒
-Which I was saving for Salutin' Day. -We'll drink wine.

234
00:29:08,014 --> 00:29:10,141
不可思议
Oh, drink wine on Salutin' Day.

235
00:29:10,216 --> 00:29:12,878
上宽下窄的船首
Bluff above the water and sharp below.

236
00:29:12,986 --> 00:29:18,390
流线形的船身  所以船速才会那么快
Gives the hull a finer entry and a long run as she goes aft. That's why she's so fast.

237
00:29:18,491 --> 00:29:21,119
船身虽重  船速却很快
Heavier, but fast despite it.

238
00:29:22,162 --> 00:29:27,498
这是未来的设计  我们生活的时代真是无比惊奇
That's the future. What a fascinating modern age we live in.

239
00:29:27,567 --> 00:29:31,469
它的船壳至少有两英尺厚
Planking and framing like that would make her hull 2ft thick. Solid oak.

240
00:29:31,538 --> 00:29:36,498
怪不得射不穿  船速最快大概能到12至14节
That's why we couldn't dent her. She's probably capable of making 12 to 14 knots.

241
00:29:37,177 --> 00:29:40,510
多亏有瓦利跟他妻子的表弟
Now we know. Thank God for Warley and his wife's second cousin.

242
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,549
它一天能航行280英里
She could be doing up to 280 miles a day.

243
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:49,680
就算追得上它  想要击败它...
Even if we did catch up with her, I mean, to take her...

244
00:29:49,756 --> 00:29:53,886
比登天还难  它有44管大炮
She's out of our class. She's a 44-gun ship.

245
00:29:55,495 --> 00:29:59,932
它的罩门跟我们一样是船尾
She's still vulnerable at the stern, like the rest of us.

246
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,706
亲爱的  一个吻多少钱?
Hello, darling. How much for a kiss?

247
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,509
(葡萄牙语) 一个吻多少钱?
Quanto cost-o kiss-o?

248
00:30:19,586 --> 00:30:22,783
-你的名字?  -我叫玛莉亚
-Name? -My name is Maria.

249
00:30:22,889 --> 00:30:26,188
我要用斧头换箭  快点
Give us arrows. I give ax. Quick, mate.

250
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:28,523
谢谢
Thank you, mate.

251
00:30:37,137 --> 00:30:40,072
借过一下
Gangway for the mail, please.

252
00:30:41,207 --> 00:30:44,608
拿去  这是重要的邮件
Here we are. Very important mail. Letters.

253
00:30:44,711 --> 00:30:47,976
他说什么?
What's he saying?

254
00:30:51,584 --> 00:30:55,418
一艘法国战舰  10号在这里靠岸后往南航行
A large man-of-war, French, stopped here on the 10th, then headed south.

255
00:31:01,161 --> 00:31:02,992
附近的某处
Somewhere here.

256
00:31:03,096 --> 00:31:05,656
比我们快三星期
A full three weeks ahead.

257
00:31:05,765 --> 00:31:07,630
可恶
Damn.

258
00:31:08,568 --> 00:31:11,332
汤姆  赶快完成交易
All right, Tom, let's get all this squared away.

259
00:31:11,438 --> 00:31:15,340
霍拉  尽快完成交易
Aye, sir. Mr Hollar. Let us complete our business here.

260
00:31:15,442 --> 00:31:18,172
准备起锚
Hands, prepare to weigh anchor.

261
00:31:20,146 --> 00:31:22,246
别光顾着泡妞  
Put that woman down, Slade. 

262
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:27,348
这是皇家海军  不是让你来逛窑子的
This is a ship of His Majesty's Navy, not a floating bordello.

263
00:31:30,156 --> 00:31:34,286
大家动手  把补给品搬上去
All hands, get these provisions stowed.

264
00:31:46,773 --> 00:31:48,365
很好
Well done.

265
00:31:48,475 --> 00:31:50,534
各位
Gentlemen.

266
00:31:51,544 --> 00:31:56,538
敬妻子和情人
To wives and to sweethearts.

267
00:31:56,649 --> 00:32:00,016
愿她们永不相见
May they never meet.

268
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:04,022
霍华德  把酒瓶拿来
Mr Howard, the bottle. The bottle stands by you, sir.

269
00:32:04,624 --> 00:32:06,956
船长?
Sir?

270
00:32:07,794 --> 00:32:12,356
布雷克尼说  你为纳尔逊将军打过仗
Excuse me, sir, but Mr Blakeney said that you served under Lord Nelson at the Nile.

271
00:32:12,465 --> 00:32:17,368
没错  当年我是个年轻的上尉  年纪跟你差不多
Indeed. I was a young lieutenant, not much older than you are now.

272
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:21,031
普灵只是个见习官
And Mr Pullings was a sniveling midshipman,

273
00:32:21,141 --> 00:32:23,507
还一直吵着想回家
still yearning for hearth and home.

274
00:32:23,576 --> 00:32:26,739
你见过他吗?  能谈谈他吗?
Did you meet him, sir? Can you tell me what he's like?

275
00:32:26,846 --> 00:32:29,974
我很荣幸与他共餐两次
I have had the honor of dining with him twice.

276
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:32,916
他两次都有跟我说话
He spoke to me on both occasions.

277
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:36,182
他是个有远见的战略家
A master tactician and a man of singular vision.

278
00:32:36,256 --> 00:32:41,523
他打仗时总是说  "别用什么战略  冲上去就打"
He always said in battle "Never mind the maneuvers, just go straight at 'em."

279
00:32:41,594 --> 00:32:45,758
他也许没谋略  却有领导才能
Some would say not a great seaman, but a great leader.

280
00:32:45,865 --> 00:32:48,891
英国要靠他对抗拿破仑
He's England's only hope if old Boney intends to invade.

281
00:32:49,002 --> 00:32:52,369
请你说说他的趣事
Sir, might we press you for an anecdote?

282
00:32:55,341 --> 00:32:58,401
他第一次跟我说的话
The first time that he spoke to me,

283
00:32:58,511 --> 00:33:03,710
我永远也忘不了  好像是昨天一样
I shall never forget his words. I remember it like it was yesterday.

284
00:33:03,783 --> 00:33:07,549
他从餐桌另一边看着我说:
He leaned across the table, he looked me straight in the eye,

285
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:12,284
"奥布里  请把盐瓶递给我"
and he said "Aubrey, may I trouble you for the salt?"

286
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:19,525
我一直试着模仿他的口气
I've always tried to say it exactly as he did ever since.

287
00:33:25,305 --> 00:33:30,709
第二次他说了个故事
The second time, the second time he told me a story

288
00:33:30,777 --> 00:33:34,304
有人在寒夜里请他穿大衣
about how someone offered him a boat cloak on a cold night.

289
00:33:34,414 --> 00:33:39,283
他并没有穿  他说他很暖和
And he said no, he didn't need it. That he was quite warm.

290
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:44,049
他的爱国心让他全身暖呼呼
His zeal for king and country kept him warm.

291
00:33:44,123 --> 00:33:48,150
听起来很做作  如果是别人
I know it sounds absurd, and were it from another man,

292
00:33:48,261 --> 00:33:53,563
我一定瞧不起他  觉得他很假
you'd cry out "What pitiful stuff" and dismiss it as mere enthusiasm.

293
00:33:53,633 --> 00:33:55,726
但出自纳尔逊的口
But with Nelson,

294
00:33:57,604 --> 00:34:00,437
你知道那是真心话
you felt your heart glow.

295
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:11,739
-对吧普灵  -没错
-Wouldn't you say, Mr Pullings? -You did indeed, sir.

296
00:34:12,318 --> 00:34:18,780
他是唯一没被权力腐化的人
Well then, he would seem to be the exception to the rule that authority corrupts.

297
00:34:18,858 --> 00:34:22,191
敬纳尔逊将军
To Lord Nelson.

298
00:34:25,965 --> 00:34:29,332
你看到这两只小虫吗?
Do you see those two weevils, Doctor?

299
00:34:29,435 --> 00:34:30,959
看到了
I do.

300
00:34:31,037 --> 00:34:33,369
你会选哪一只?
Which would you choose?

301
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:40,310
这两只其实一模一样  它们都是象鼻虫
Neither. There's no difference between them. They're the same species of curculio.

302
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,814
如果你非选不可呢?
If you had to choose.

303
00:34:42,882 --> 00:34:46,340
必须要做出一个抉择的话...
If you were forced to make a choice. If there was no other...

304
00:34:46,452 --> 00:34:50,047
如果你硬要我选
Well then, if you're going to push me,

305
00:34:52,358 --> 00:34:55,350
我会选右边这只
I would choose the right-hand weevil.

306
00:34:55,461 --> 00:34:59,192
它看起来比较凶恶
It has significant advantage in both length and breadth.

307
00:34:59,299 --> 00:35:02,632
我赢了  你被我说倒了
There, I have you. You're completely dished.

308
00:35:02,702 --> 00:35:08,641
你要知道  在军中有句话说  二恶相权取其轻
Do you not know that in the service one must always choose the lesser of two weevils?

309
00:35:15,315 --> 00:35:18,716
这笑话太冷了
He who would pun would pick a pocket.

310
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:22,483
逊毙了
Really. Weevils.

311
00:35:22,555 --> 00:35:27,891
二恶相权取其轻
To the lesser of two weevils.

312
00:35:38,538 --> 00:35:41,507
乔
Yay, Joe.

313
00:35:44,043 --> 00:35:46,102
乔  继续
Go on, Joe.

314
00:36:04,764 --> 00:36:07,062
上帝可以收回我的灵魂
The Lord taketh,

315
00:36:08,267 --> 00:36:11,202
也可以把它还给我
and the Lord giveth away.

316
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:14,137
听到吗?  他开口了耶
You hear that? He said something.

317
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,107
医生  他说话了
Doctor. He spoke, Doctor.

318
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:19,110
干得好  史蒂芬
Well done indeed, Stephen.

319
00:36:19,212 --> 00:36:22,204
*Adieu to you Spanish ladies*

320
00:36:22,281 --> 00:36:26,411
*Farewell and adieu to you ladies of Spain*

321
00:36:26,486 --> 00:36:31,423
*For we've received orders to sail for old England*

322
00:36:31,491 --> 00:36:37,657
*We hope in a short time to see you again*

323
00:36:38,564 --> 00:36:42,728
哈伦的歌声真好听
What a wonderfully true voice Mr Hollom possesses.

324
00:36:42,802 --> 00:36:45,327
是啊
Indeed.

325
00:36:46,472 --> 00:36:49,168
*Come, all you bold young thoughtless men*

326
00:36:49,275 --> 00:36:51,766
*A warning take by me*

327
00:36:51,844 --> 00:36:56,440
*And never leave your happy homes to sail the raging sea*

328
00:37:08,194 --> 00:37:11,322
海上有动静
On deck there. Sail ho.

329
00:37:12,298 --> 00:37:14,493
好像是一艘船
Looks like a frigate.

330
00:37:19,105 --> 00:37:21,198
它怎么来的?
How did it get there?

331
00:37:21,307 --> 00:37:24,970
-我们一定要转过去迎敌  -但是它又有上风优势
-We must turn and fight. -But he has the weather gauge again.

332
00:37:25,044 --> 00:37:28,343
它一定早就在等我们上钩
He must've been watching us from some inlet.

333
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:35,845
它吃定我们了  怎么办?
My God. What can we do? He has us by the hip.

334
00:37:35,955 --> 00:37:37,946
逃得越快越好
Run like smoke and oakum.

335
00:37:38,024 --> 00:37:41,960
-船帆不够用  -若有必要连手帕都要用上
-We'll have to bend every sail. -We'll put up our handkerchiefs if we have to.

336
00:37:42,028 --> 00:37:45,987
我们一定要逃走  快去吧  艾伦
We must survive this day. Let's get about it. Mr Allen, gentlemen.

337
00:37:46,065 --> 00:37:48,124
全体船员  扬帆
All hands, make sail.

338
00:37:48,201 --> 00:37:53,138
这是他第二次占上风  不会有第三次
This is the second time he's done this to me. There will not be a third.

339
00:38:09,021 --> 00:38:14,755
那是一艘恶魔开的鬼船
I tell ya, the devil's at the wheel of that there phantom ship.

340
00:38:14,861 --> 00:38:17,261
你最好小心点
You better hold fast.

341
00:38:23,536 --> 00:38:25,697
这家伙跟我有仇吗?
What is it with this man?

342
00:38:25,771 --> 00:38:31,573
我是不是杀了他的亲人?  他的爱子?
Did I kill a relative of his in battle, perhaps? His boy, God forbid?

343
00:38:31,677 --> 00:38:33,702
他的作风跟你很像  杰克
He fights like you, Jack.

344
00:38:52,298 --> 00:38:55,233
把太阳调到海平线上
Bring the sun down to the horizon.

345
00:38:55,301 --> 00:38:59,533
当它碰到海平线  威廉森  注意看
When its lower limb is touching the horizon... Williamson, look to your sextant.

346
00:38:59,605 --> 00:39:03,473
当太阳不再动
When the orb is no longer rising,

347
00:39:03,576 --> 00:39:07,137
它就达到了顶点  那就是正午
then it has reached its zenith and that would be noon.

348
00:39:07,246 --> 00:39:09,612
-船长  -普灵
-Sir? -Mr Pullings.

349
00:39:09,715 --> 00:39:11,910
-你会了吗?  -会了
-Do you make noon, Mr Hollom? -Yes, sir.

350
00:39:11,984 --> 00:39:14,475
那就去教他们吧
Call noon. It's your class.

351
00:39:16,789 --> 00:39:20,156
-正午了  -尼克斯  中午十二时
-Sir, that's noon. -Mr Nichols, make that twelve.

352
00:39:20,259 --> 00:39:22,591
还有六小时?
Six hours?

353
00:39:22,662 --> 00:39:24,926
最多五小时
Five at most.

354
00:39:24,997 --> 00:39:28,956
天黑前别被它追上来
Just keep us out of her reach until nightfall.

355
00:39:37,109 --> 00:39:42,012
它会跟我们一样  动作要快一点
She's to look like us, lads, don't forget. Jibbo, make fast those whips.

356
00:39:42,114 --> 00:39:45,572
风势太大  主桅不能做太高
We didn't want to make it any taller, on account of this wind.

357
00:39:45,651 --> 00:39:51,783
-他们在做什么?  -你的第一艘船
-Excuse me, sir, but what are they building? -Your first command.

358
00:39:57,663 --> 00:40:00,029
快点  它要追上来了
Quickly. She'll be on top of us.

359
00:40:00,132 --> 00:40:03,033
放下吊在船桅上的木筏
Take the weight on the yard tackles.

360
00:40:03,135 --> 00:40:05,433
把木筏推出去
Fend her off.

361
00:40:05,504 --> 00:40:07,995
放下去
Lower away on the main.

362
00:40:14,981 --> 00:40:18,144
-我可不想失去你  -是  先生
-Wouldn't want to lose you. -Aye, sir.

363
00:40:29,228 --> 00:40:34,791
那里有系索  把它拖到船尾
There's a painter. Pass her aft. Outside everything, mind.

364
00:40:34,867 --> 00:40:39,167
快  它十分钟后就能追上来
Lively now. We've not ten minutes before he's up with us.

365
00:40:45,344 --> 00:40:49,178
-记着船长教你的  -用力拉
-Mind what the captain told you. -Pull, boys. That's it.

366
00:41:12,738 --> 00:41:13,762
现在
Now.

367
00:41:19,445 --> 00:41:22,380
基里克  熄灯
Killick there. Douse your light.

368
00:41:28,788 --> 00:41:30,415
艾伦  准备好
Mr Allen, make ready.

369
00:42:11,564 --> 00:42:14,055
我们钓到一条大鱼
Hello. We caught a fish.

370
00:42:15,601 --> 00:42:17,501
你来掌舵  波登
Take the helm, Bonden.

371
00:42:17,603 --> 00:42:21,300
这很好玩吧
-Now, tell me that wasn't fun. -Yes, sir.

372
00:42:23,075 --> 00:42:25,771
左满舵
Hard a'larboard.

373
00:42:54,673 --> 00:42:59,167
叫大家下去休息  我来值星
Stand the men down, Mr Pullings. I'll take this watch.

374
00:42:59,278 --> 00:43:00,870
是  长官
Aye, sir.

375
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:05,542
莫维  艾伦  别出声  快去吧
Mr Mowett, Mr Allen, calmly now. You know his orders.

376
00:43:05,651 --> 00:43:07,710
干得好
Well done, sir.

377
00:43:09,522 --> 00:43:14,118
它一定是艘鬼船  它突然就跟在后面
She's a right phantom, she is. The way she come up again, right behind us like that.

378
00:43:14,193 --> 00:43:19,529
不晓得从哪儿冒出来  就像第一次在浓雾中出现
Out of nowhere. And right behind us. Like that first time, out the fog.

379
00:43:19,632 --> 00:43:22,123
用大炮打它都没用
With our shot bouncin' off her.

380
00:43:22,201 --> 00:43:25,170
难怪船长的绰号是幸运杰克
Captain's not called Lucky Jack for no reason.

381
00:43:25,237 --> 00:43:29,333
不管怎样它还是艘私掠船  幸运杰克会打败它的
Phantom or no, she's a privateer, and Lucky Jack'll have her.

382
00:43:29,408 --> 00:43:32,343
对付鬼船不能只靠运气
You need more than luck 'gainst a phantom.

383
00:43:34,146 --> 00:43:37,377
-那是海盗船吗?  -他们不是海盗
-Is she like a pirate? -No, they're not pirates, Lofty.

384
00:43:37,483 --> 00:43:42,011
如果是的话  我们就能把他们吊死
Oh, no. If they were, we could hang them when we catch 'em.

385
00:43:42,087 --> 00:43:44,885
法国佬给私掠船的命令是
Privateer gets a piece of paper from the Frenchies

386
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:47,652
只要看到英国船就可以开炮
says they can hunt down anything with our flag.

387
00:43:47,726 --> 00:43:51,389
他们也抢了不少商船
They go after rich merchantmen and the like.

388
00:43:51,497 --> 00:43:55,228
逮到他们就能分不少钱
But think on our share of the prize money.

389
00:43:55,334 --> 00:44:00,328
船上一定有很多黄金  龙涎香  还有用不完的金银珠宝
She'll be loaded with gold and ambergris and all the gems of Araby.

390
00:44:00,406 --> 00:44:03,898
就算发了财也得活着回家
That's all very well, Nagle. Got to get home to spend it, but.

391
00:44:04,009 --> 00:44:06,341
死人可不会请我喝酒
Never met a dead man who bought me a drink.

392
00:44:06,412 --> 00:44:10,371
你也没请活人喝过酒
And I've never met a live one that you bought one for, neither.

393
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:17,882
你何必三更半夜挨寒受冻  最后一杯咖啡
Sitting up all night, catching your death of cold. That's the last of the coffee, too.

394
00:44:17,957 --> 00:44:20,050
谢谢你
Thank you, Killick.

395
00:44:24,396 --> 00:44:26,421
波登
Bonden.

396
00:44:26,532 --> 00:44:29,695
不必向东了  设定航向  西南偏南
That's enough easting. Set a course sou'-sou'west.

397
00:44:29,768 --> 00:44:33,761
遵命  西南偏南
Aye, sir. Sou'-sou'west.

398
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:40,278
前有船只
Sail.

399
00:44:40,379 --> 00:44:43,576
右舷船首22度半
Two points off starboard bow.

400
00:44:44,116 --> 00:44:46,584
幸运杰克万岁
Three cheers for Lucky Jack.

401
00:44:52,725 --> 00:44:55,091
是我们的了
She's ours, boys.

402
00:45:04,837 --> 00:45:09,001
你赢了
Foul. You got away before me.

403
00:45:13,178 --> 00:45:16,147
升起高低前桅帆
-Set royals and courses. -Sir.

404
00:45:16,248 --> 00:45:18,739
叫人站在栏杆边
Have the idlers placed along the rails.

405
00:45:18,817 --> 00:45:20,785
他太神了
I've never seen the like.

406
00:45:20,853 --> 00:45:24,812
绕一百海里后咬住敌舰船尾
It has to be more than 100 sea miles and he brings us up on his tail.

407
00:45:24,924 --> 00:45:29,088
这才叫航海高手
That's seamanship, Mr Pullings. My God, that's seamanship.

408
00:45:29,161 --> 00:45:32,494
我就说会成功  天黑就能追上去
Told you it would work, Will. We'll have them by nightfall.

409
00:45:32,598 --> 00:45:36,090
-他们死定了  -风向对我们有利
-I think we've got him, sir. -And the wind favors us this time.

410
00:45:36,168 --> 00:45:39,467
话别说的太早
Don't count your eggs before they're in the pudding.

411
00:45:39,538 --> 00:45:44,475
不过只要能追上去  就能逮到他们
Still, if we can close this gap and get up behind her, she may well be ours.

412
00:45:44,543 --> 00:45:46,943
老天保佑快刮强风
Touch wood. Scratch a stay.

413
00:45:47,546 --> 00:45:51,141
转三圈  愿老天保佑我们
Turn three times. May the Lord and saints preserve us.

414
00:46:06,632 --> 00:46:08,327
转过来
Turn.

415
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,234
动作快点  快把救生索绑好
Move along, man. We'll have lost him before you rig it up.

416
00:46:12,338 --> 00:46:14,465
停
Hold.

417
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,835
-船速十二节  -十二节  很好
-12 knots, sir. -That's 12 knots. That's good.

418
00:46:18,911 --> 00:46:23,575
再多点  派人站到上风面
I want more. Have all the spare hands placed on the windward rail.

419
00:46:23,682 --> 00:46:26,981
霍拉  把大家都叫起来
Mr Hollar. Rouse up the off-watch.

420
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,253
全都站到右舷栏杆
All hands on starboard rail.

421
00:46:31,924 --> 00:46:35,325
迎风扬起左顶帆
Come up the larboard topsail sheets.

422
00:46:52,945 --> 00:46:57,405
-船帆全都升起  -超过极限  船帆就会被吹走
-We're crackin' on. -We'll be crackin' up if he don't watch it.

423
00:46:57,516 --> 00:47:02,112
船长知道这艘船的极限
Captain knows this ship. He knows what she can take.

424
00:47:06,291 --> 00:47:10,728
把前后救生索绑好
Mr Hollar, I want lifelines fore and aft.

425
00:47:10,796 --> 00:47:12,525
别偷懒
No lounging, boy.

426
00:47:12,598 --> 00:47:18,298
前后救生索把小艇绑牢
Lifelines, fore and aft. Double-grape that launch.

427
00:47:20,539 --> 00:47:22,939
那是合恩角
Cape Horn, Doctor.

428
00:47:38,757 --> 00:47:41,749
快盖起来  这儿的水够多了
Close the lid. There's enough water in the grog.

429
00:47:41,827 --> 00:47:43,727
多谢了
Thank you for that, Davies.

430
00:47:43,796 --> 00:47:48,665
船长还想追下去吗?
Reckon the captain will follow him round the Horn, every stitch of canvas flying?

431
00:47:48,767 --> 00:47:51,235
就算追到地狱  他也要追上去
I reckon he'd follow him to the gates of hell.

432
00:47:51,303 --> 00:47:55,831
那艘恶魔船要把我们带入陷阱
It's a devil ship, I tell ya. And it's leadin' us right into a trap.

433
00:47:59,244 --> 00:48:02,111
它要带我们冲向合恩角
She's making a run for the Horn, sir.

434
00:48:02,181 --> 00:48:05,150
我很怕船桅会被吹断
I'll not vouch for this mast. Not around the Horn.

435
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:08,276
我会把你的话记在日志
Thank you. Your comments will be noted in the log.

436
00:48:08,353 --> 00:48:14,622
掌帆员站好岗位  风太大了  快收帆
Sail trimmers to their stations. Get the sails off her, lads. She's over-pressed.

437
00:48:14,693 --> 00:48:16,854
用力拉下来
Give 'em a pull and belay.

438
00:48:32,344 --> 00:48:35,836
就快追到了  我不会放弃
We're closing on her, Tom. I'll not give up now.

439
00:48:35,948 --> 00:48:39,179
迎风转向  设定航向  西南偏西
Come up on the wind, Barret. Set a course sou'west by west.

440
00:48:39,284 --> 00:48:41,878
遵命  西南偏西
Sou'west by west, sir.

441
00:48:43,055 --> 00:48:44,784
科勒米
Mr Calamy.

442
00:48:44,857 --> 00:48:47,553
西南偏西
Idlers and waisters below.

443
00:48:51,363 --> 00:48:54,161
我们要去合恩角
We're for the Horn, boys.

444
00:48:58,137 --> 00:49:00,071
把顶帆收起来
Close reef topsails.

445
00:49:13,585 --> 00:49:15,348
快点  伙计们
Lively, lads.

446
00:49:19,658 --> 00:49:24,425
封舱  别等沉船了就来不及了
Batten down those hatches before we're on the bottom.

447
00:49:34,006 --> 00:49:36,839
约翰逊  图拉维  收起后帆
Johansson, Truelove. To the mizzen.

448
00:49:38,243 --> 00:49:40,177
都绑紧了
All secure.

449
00:49:40,245 --> 00:49:42,213
很好
Down ye go, lads.

450
00:49:48,687 --> 00:49:53,386
帮瓦利把后桅顶帆拉下来
Mr Hollom, help young Warley on the mizzen topgallant.

451
00:49:56,862 --> 00:50:00,229
-我需要更多人手  -快去
-I'll need more men, sir. -Yes. Go.

452
00:50:08,574 --> 00:50:12,271
哈伦  帮帮我
Mr Hollom, sir. Help me.

453
00:50:19,084 --> 00:50:22,747
快去帮忙
Tudor, Ellers. To Mr Allen.

454
00:50:22,821 --> 00:50:27,815
爬上去把后桅顶帆收起来
You men, lay aloft. The mizzen topgallant. Light along.

455
00:50:35,767 --> 00:50:37,826
救命啊
Help.

456
00:50:40,906 --> 00:50:42,931
救命啊
Help me.

457
00:50:48,814 --> 00:50:51,578
有人落海
Man overboard.

458
00:50:52,751 --> 00:50:57,245
后桅没有了  大伙到船艉
Mizzen's gone. Hands to the taffrail.

459
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:11,200
在那儿
He's over there, sir.

460
00:51:11,303 --> 00:51:14,966
快游过去  快点
Swim for the wreckage, man. Swim.

461
00:51:15,774 --> 00:51:17,469
我在这儿
Over here.

462
00:51:17,542 --> 00:51:22,844
快把木桶等等能浮的东西都丢下海
Mr Allen, gratings and barrels, anything that floats, overboard.

463
00:51:22,948 --> 00:51:27,044
船身在倾斜  就快翻船了
She's broaching. We're losing her.

464
00:51:27,152 --> 00:51:30,485
残骸会把船身拖下去
Sir, the wreckage is acting as a sea anchor.

465
00:51:30,555 --> 00:51:34,116
不砍断救生索就会沉船
We must cut it loose. It's going to sink us.

466
00:51:34,192 --> 00:51:38,026
他就快游到了
Sir, he's going to make it. He can do it.

467
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:42,157
-加油  -快游呀
-Come on, Will. -Come on. Hand over hand.

468
00:51:42,234 --> 00:51:47,399
快游呀  快游过去  就快沉船了
For God's sake, Will, swim. Swim for the wreckage, Will.

469
00:51:56,048 --> 00:51:57,982
你行的
You can do it, Will.

470
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:02,214
-加油  -加油  威尔
-Swim. Come on. -Come on, Will. Swim.

471
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:08,066
1805年直布罗陀  瓦利

472
00:54:08,134 --> 00:54:10,432
重返家园

473
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:35,306
-他又来了  -谁?
-He's been at it again. -Who's that, then?

474
00:54:35,373 --> 00:54:38,206
-瘟神  -什么东西?
-The Jonah. -What's that?

475
00:54:48,587 --> 00:54:53,047
打仗时  战死比较能令人接受
The deaths in actual battle are the easiest to bear.

476
00:54:53,758 --> 00:55:00,823
死在我的手术刀下  或是因为感染而死的弟兄
For my own part, those who die under my knife, or from some subsequent infection,

477
00:55:00,899 --> 00:55:06,838
我总是说他们是死在敌人手上  不是死在我手上
I have to remind myself that it was the enemy that killed them, not me.

478
00:55:09,007 --> 00:55:11,601
他是战争的牺牲者
That young man was a casualty of war.

479
00:55:14,346 --> 00:55:18,578
你也说二恶相权取其轻
As you said yourself, you have to choose the lesser of two evils.

480
00:55:18,683 --> 00:55:20,742
小虫
Weevils.

481
00:55:24,189 --> 00:55:28,592
瓦利人缘很好  船员都会很难过
The crew will take it badly. Warley was popular.

482
00:55:28,693 --> 00:55:32,754
他们有向你反映什么吗?
Have they expressed any feelings on the matter to you?

483
00:55:40,038 --> 00:55:43,064
我在回答之前要先问下
Jack, before answering, I'm compelled to ask,

484
00:55:43,141 --> 00:55:47,271
我该把你当朋友还是船长?
am I speaking with my old friend or to the ship's captain?

485
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:51,975
我会跟船长说我最痛恨内奸
To the captain I'd say there's little I detest more than an informer.

486
00:55:52,083 --> 00:55:55,314
-你活像个爱尔兰人  -我就是爱尔兰人
-Now you're talking like an Irishman. -I am an Irishman.

487
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:57,445
那就把我当朋友
As a friend, then.

488
00:55:57,556 --> 00:56:03,392
身为你的朋友  我从没怀疑过你当船长的能力
As a friend, I would say that I have never once doubted your abilities as a captain.

489
00:56:03,461 --> 00:56:05,395
有话就直说吧
Speak plainly, Stephen.

490
00:56:07,165 --> 00:56:11,898
也许我们早就该返航
Perhaps we should have turned back weeks ago.

491
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:15,838
跟随幸运杰克的弟兄们
The men, of course they would follow Lucky Jack anywhere,

492
00:56:15,941 --> 00:56:18,171
都很有自信能打胜仗
rightfully confident of victory.

493
00:56:18,276 --> 00:56:23,908
这就是问题所在  你很少吃败仗
But therein lies the problem. You're not accustomed to defeat.

494
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:29,066
追逐这艘比我们更强的战舰  
And chasing this larger, faster ship with its long guns 

495
00:56:29,067 --> 00:56:31,650
也许是你的自尊心在作祟
is beginning to smack of pride.

496
00:56:31,756 --> 00:56:35,157
这不是自尊  这是我的职责
It's not a question of pride. It is a question of duty.

497
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:37,694
职责  你说的好伟大哦
Duty. Yes, I've heard it well spoken of.

498
00:56:37,796 --> 00:56:42,426
尽管嘲笑我吧  反正你只会在鸡蛋里挑骨头
Be as satiric as you like. Viewing the world through a microscope is your prerogative.

499
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:43,940
这是艘战舰  
This is a ship of war. 

500
00:56:43,941 --> 00:56:47,028
为了尽好职责  我什么都愿意做
I will grind whatever grist the mill requires to fulfill my duty.

501
00:56:47,138 --> 00:56:49,504
甚至不惜一切?
Whatever the cost?

502
00:56:49,608 --> 00:56:51,838
不惜一切
Whatever the cost.

503
00:56:51,943 --> 00:56:54,707
盲目地服从命令
To follow orders with no regard for cost.

504
00:56:54,813 --> 00:56:59,113
这难道不是意气用事吗?
Can you really claim there's nothing personal in this call to duty?

505
00:56:59,184 --> 00:57:01,675
军人的天职就是服从命令
Orders are subject to the requirement of the service.

506
00:57:01,786 --> 00:57:08,055
我奉命一定要追到巴西  我早就完成任务了
My orders were to follow him as far as Brazil. I exceeded my orders a long time ago.

507
00:57:10,295 --> 00:57:12,354
我抓住了
Got it.

508
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:18,892
风向改变了
The wind's backing, sir.

509
00:57:19,004 --> 00:57:23,031
我们不能继续向西航行
Sir, we just can't hold this westerly course any longer.

510
00:57:23,642 --> 00:57:29,672
不能直走就绕过去  往南航行
If we can't sail through the damn wind, we'll bloody well sail around it. Due south.

511
00:57:29,748 --> 00:57:32,740
多远?
How far south, sir?

512
00:57:32,851 --> 00:57:36,378
要多远就多远
As far as is necessary, Mr Pullings.

513
00:57:36,488 --> 00:57:38,922
-是  船长  -打起精神
-Aye, sir. -Lively.

514
00:57:40,025 --> 00:57:44,189
-往南航行  波登  -是  往南
-Due south, please, Mr Bonden. -Due south, sir.

515
00:57:46,731 --> 00:57:49,894
用力稳住
Heave. Steady.

516
00:58:25,203 --> 00:58:29,537
很显然发生了很有趣的事  只是我完全不懂
Clearly something nautical and fascinating just happened. I am at a loss.

517
00:58:29,607 --> 00:58:34,101
我们往北转向  我们又朝着太阳航行
We have made our turn northward. We are headed back toward the sun.

518
00:58:34,212 --> 00:58:36,271
敬太阳
To the sun.

519
00:58:38,917 --> 00:58:42,546
为了庆祝这件事
And by way of anticipation of this event,

520
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:48,252
我请基里克做了些好东西
I have asked Killick to prepare something special.

521
00:58:48,326 --> 00:58:52,626
-基里克  好了没  -我早就好了
-Killick. Killick there. -I'm already here, ain't I?

522
00:58:55,133 --> 00:58:59,331
各位  这就是...
Gentlemen, I give you,

523
00:59:00,138 --> 00:59:02,436
我们的目的地
our destination.

524
00:59:08,747 --> 00:59:12,478
-那是加拉巴哥群岛  -加拉巴哥群岛
-It's the Galapagos Islands. -The Galapagos Islands.

525
00:59:15,086 --> 00:59:17,350
我们的捕鲸船队在那儿
Our whaling fleet is there.

526
00:59:17,455 --> 00:59:22,916
它们的渔获量很值钱  拿破仑想抢来当战争经费
And their cargo would put a pretty penny into old Bones-aparte's invasion purse.

527
00:59:22,994 --> 00:59:28,694
"地狱号" 一定在那儿  我敢打包票
That's where the Acheron will be. Sure as there's carts to horses.

528
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,462
普灵  别客气
So, Mr Pullings, if you'll permit me,

529
00:59:31,536 --> 00:59:34,528
来一块艾贝玛小岛
a slice of Albemarle.

530
00:59:35,507 --> 00:59:39,136
至于你医生  雷东达岩礁
And for you, Doctor, Redondo Rock.

531
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:40,541
太好了
Perfect.

532
00:59:40,645 --> 00:59:43,375
"地狱号" 是我的
And the Acheron for me.

533
00:59:49,554 --> 00:59:54,821
*经过大风和大浪*
Safe and sound at home again Let the waters roar, Jack

534
00:59:54,893 --> 00:59:59,853
*经过大风和大浪*
Safe and sound at home again Let the waters roar, Jack

535
00:59:59,964 --> 01:00:06,199
*安全重返旧家园*
Long we tossed on the rolling main Now we're safe ashore, Jack

536
01:00:06,304 --> 01:00:11,640
*勿忘你的老战友*
Don't forget your old shipmates

537
01:00:11,709 --> 01:00:17,147
*同仇敌忾并肩作战*
We have worked the selfsame gun Quarterdeck division

538
01:00:17,215 --> 01:00:22,881
*你装弹药我开炮  打赢胜仗凯旋归*
Sponger I, and loader you Through the whole commission

539
01:00:22,987 --> 01:00:29,358
*安全重返旧家园*
Long we tossed on the rolling main Now we're safe ashore, Jack

540
01:00:29,427 --> 01:00:36,697
*勿忘你的老战友*
Don't forget your old shipmates

541
01:01:13,225 --> 01:01:15,625
加拉巴哥群岛

542
01:01:18,025 --> 01:01:19,925
拉斯安甘达斯
Las...

543
01:01:20,979 --> 01:01:27,817
魔幻之岛  听说那儿充满了奇异生物
The Enchanted Isles. They're said to be full of strange and wonderful beasts.

544
01:01:28,653 --> 01:01:31,747
我们到了就补充粮食和水
When we get there, we'll have to stop for food and water.

545
01:01:31,823 --> 01:01:35,782
我答应你  我们至少要待几天...
I promise you, during that time...several days at least...

546
01:01:35,894 --> 01:01:40,297
你可以尽情搜集昆虫样本
you can wander at will, collecting bugs and beetles to your heart's content.

547
01:01:40,398 --> 01:01:44,892
你是第一个去那儿的自然学家
You'll be the first naturalist to set foot on the islands, I'll wager.

548
01:01:44,969 --> 01:01:48,336
那就太好了
I would like that of all things.

549
01:01:51,976 --> 01:01:55,241
-这是一种昆虫吗?  -对
-Is it an insect? -Yes.

550
01:01:57,081 --> 01:02:01,916
看起来不像  好像一根树枝
Doesn't look like one. I mean, it looks like a stick.

551
01:02:02,687 --> 01:02:05,087
这就是重点
Yes, that's the whole point.

552
01:02:05,156 --> 01:02:09,115
它必须伪装才能存活
It's disguised itself in order to survive.

553
01:02:13,131 --> 01:02:17,795
这只蜘蛛伪装成一只蚂蚁
There's a spider that's disguised itself as an ant.

554
01:02:17,869 --> 01:02:22,616
这种昆虫必须伪装成花刺  
And here's an insect that's taken on the shape of a thorn 

555
01:02:22,617 --> 01:02:25,173
才不会被鸟吃掉
to save itself from the birds.

556
01:02:26,678 --> 01:02:28,873
上帝改变了它们?
Did God make them change?

557
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:32,347
上帝改变它们?  是  没错
Does God make them change? Yes, certainly.

558
01:02:32,450 --> 01:02:35,886
但是它们自己会改变吗?
But do they also change themselves?

559
01:02:35,987 --> 01:02:38,820
这问题才值得深思
Now that is a question, isn't it?

560
01:02:40,858 --> 01:02:43,520
加拉巴哥岛到了
Sir, we've raised the Galapagos.

561
01:02:43,628 --> 01:02:45,687
我来了
I'm coming.

562
01:03:20,565 --> 01:03:24,365
-瞧  在岩石后面  -我看到了
-Look. Beyond the rock. -Yes, I see.

563
01:03:24,435 --> 01:03:28,098
那是什么东西  海鸥吗?
What is it? Curious, eh? Some type of gull?

564
01:03:28,206 --> 01:03:33,667
-丑得要命  -好恶心  全身都长满疣
-There's an ugly devil. -Disgusting. It's got warts all over it.

565
01:03:33,745 --> 01:03:36,714
全都是丑八怪
Ugly devils, aren't they?

566
01:03:37,682 --> 01:03:40,344
没有女人  只有鸭子跟蜥蜴
I can't see any women. Just ducks and lizards.

567
01:03:40,418 --> 01:03:43,353
没有女人真是不自然
What, no women? It ain't natural.

568
01:03:44,689 --> 01:03:46,554
太不可思议了
How extraordinary.

569
01:03:46,624 --> 01:03:48,455
什么?
What is, sir?

570
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:52,586
那些鸟是某种鸬鹚  但是它们不能飞
Those birds. They're a species of cormorant, but they are flightless.

571
01:03:52,697 --> 01:03:55,359
它们的翅膀退化了?
Do you see their underdeveloped wings?

572
01:03:55,433 --> 01:03:59,028
这是新发现的物种
By all that's holy, I think that's unknown to science.

573
01:03:59,103 --> 01:04:02,903
它们不怕那些恐龙
The dragons don't seem to bother them.

574
01:04:03,541 --> 01:04:07,978
那是鬣鳞蜥  素食动物
They're a type of iguana, I should think. Therefore, they're vegetarian.

575
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:11,139
-你要抓一只吗?  -抓一对吧?
-Will you catch one? -A pair of them, I should think.

576
01:04:11,249 --> 01:04:14,446
它们生下的后代  你可以送给国王
Then you can present one of their offspring to the king.

577
01:04:14,552 --> 01:04:18,249
-有一只要游泳  -它们不会游泳
-Look. There's one going for a swim. -Iguanas don't swim.

578
01:04:18,322 --> 01:04:20,586
这些就会游泳
These ones do.

579
01:04:29,634 --> 01:04:31,761
我的天啊
I'll be damned.

580
01:04:31,836 --> 01:04:38,139
才刚来就发现两个新物种  太惊人了
Two new species in as many minutes. That's remarkable.

581
01:05:01,499 --> 01:05:06,459
各就各位  抛下缆索准备救人
All hands about ship. Off tacks and sheets. Prepare the mainsail to haul.

582
01:05:15,713 --> 01:05:19,308
-我是奥布里船长  -我是信天翁号领航员霍格
-Aubrey. -Hogg. Master of the Albatross.

583
01:05:19,383 --> 01:05:22,841
老天保佑你  老天保佑大家
God bless you, Captain. God bless you all.

584
01:05:23,855 --> 01:05:26,824
-科勒米  给这些人食物和清水  -是
-Mr Calamy, food and water for these men. -Aye, sir.

585
01:05:26,891 --> 01:05:30,349
-霍华德  解除戒备  -陆战队员  把枪放下
-Mr Howard, stand your men down. -Royal Marines, trail arms.

586
01:05:31,229 --> 01:05:34,289
我们一星期前来补充装备时
We was coming back for fresh lines no more than a week ago.

587
01:05:34,365 --> 01:05:39,826
遭到偷袭  狗娘养的海盗把我们的船烧掉
Hid in that inlet yonder. Burnt our bloody ship to the waterline. Fucking pirates.

588
01:05:39,904 --> 01:05:42,202
船员被囚  船长遇害
Crew prisoner, captain dead.

589
01:05:42,306 --> 01:05:46,402
一艘黑色三桅帆船  损失惨重
She were a big black three-master. Break your heart, it would.

590
01:05:46,511 --> 01:05:51,710
一万两千英镑和上等鱼油  我们出海两年的收获
$12,000 sterling of the finest grade oil they took. We been out more than two years.

591
01:05:51,816 --> 01:05:53,716
它的航向?
And her course?

592
01:05:53,818 --> 01:05:56,981
西偏南11度  跟着捕鲸船队
Maybe a point south of west, following the rest of the fleet.

593
01:05:57,054 --> 01:06:00,251
普灵  记下他们的名字
Mr Pullings, enter these men's names into the ship's books.

594
01:06:00,358 --> 01:06:03,555
艾伦  航向西偏南
Mr Allen, set a course. West by south.

595
01:06:03,661 --> 01:06:05,891
全体船员启航
All hands, make sail.

596
01:06:05,997 --> 01:06:09,023
不补充粮食吗?
Sir, should we not take on fresh provisions?

597
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:12,228
一分一刻都不能浪费
Mr Mowett, there's not a moment to lose.

598
01:06:27,385 --> 01:06:32,413
-你忘了你的承诺吗?  -我必须完成任务
-Have you forgotten your promise? -Subject to the requirements of the service.

599
01:06:32,523 --> 01:06:35,720
不能为了抓髭鳞蜥延误时间
I cannot delay for the sake of an iguana or a giant peccary.

600
01:06:35,793 --> 01:06:39,251
它们很有趣但是没有用
Fascinating, no doubt, but of no immediate application.

601
01:06:39,363 --> 01:06:43,390
有个方法能让我们两全其美
There is, I think, an opportunity here to serve both our purposes.

602
01:06:43,467 --> 01:06:46,595
这是座狭长小岛
As I understand it, this is a long, thin island.

603
01:06:46,704 --> 01:06:50,231
你一定要绕过去才能出海  我可以走到小岛另一边
You need to sail around it. I could walk across it.

604
01:06:50,308 --> 01:06:54,244
你光是看空鸟巢就会看半天
I have known you to spend hours staring into a deserted bird's nest.

605
01:06:54,312 --> 01:06:58,271
我可以走快点  只做重要的测量
I could walk briskly, pausing only for important measurements.

606
01:06:58,382 --> 01:07:02,546
这些是自然历史的重大发现
Making discoveries that could advance our knowledge of natural history.

607
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:06,716
如果风向允许我就会答应
If wind and tide had been against us, I should have said yes.

608
01:07:06,791 --> 01:07:09,988
可惜没有  我必须说不
They're not. I'm obliged to say no.

609
01:07:11,662 --> 01:07:15,393
我明白了  所以我只能委曲求全
I see. So after all this time in your service,

610
01:07:15,466 --> 01:07:20,335
乖乖参加这场无谓的追逐战
I must simply content myself to form part of this belligerent expedition,

611
01:07:20,438 --> 01:07:25,432
你错过自然的宝藏  只为摧毁敌人  权力让你完全腐化
hurry past wonders, bent on destruction. I say nothing of the corruption of power...

612
01:07:25,509 --> 01:07:29,104
-别忘了你的身份  -不
-You forget yourself, Doctor. -No, Jack.

613
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:33,480
你才忘了自己是谁  做人一定要信守承诺
You've forgotten yourself. For my part, I look upon a promise as binding.

614
01:07:33,584 --> 01:07:37,918
我的承诺有条件  这是艘战舰不是私人游艇
The promise was conditional. I command a king's ship, not a private yacht.

615
01:07:37,989 --> 01:07:42,119
我们可没时间陪你玩
We do not have time for your damned hobbies, sir.

616
01:08:10,054 --> 01:08:12,522
好吧
All right.

617
01:08:14,492 --> 01:08:20,055
把鱼拿下去  冲洗甲板
Get those fish below. Sluice down this deck.

618
01:08:20,164 --> 01:08:23,395
把他们带下去
Davies, don't leave them there. Get them below.

619
01:08:23,501 --> 01:08:25,162
布雷克尼
Mr Blakeney.

620
01:08:25,236 --> 01:08:29,468
我在甲板上找到一只怪虫
Sir, I found a curious beetle walking along the deck.

621
01:08:32,677 --> 01:08:35,510
我猜是加拉巴哥甲虫
I think it's a Galapagos beetle.

622
01:08:36,547 --> 01:08:38,310
一定是
I'm sure of it.

623
01:08:39,483 --> 01:08:44,682
你在岛上走半天可能都找不到
Were you to walk all day on the island, you might never come across it.

624
01:08:46,857 --> 01:08:50,190
没错  很有可能
Yes, that is more than likely sure.

625
01:08:50,928 --> 01:08:53,362
你可以拿去
You can have it, sir.

626
01:09:09,747 --> 01:09:12,341
布雷克尼
Mr Blakeney.

627
01:09:13,551 --> 01:09:16,577
谢谢你
-Thank you. -Sir.

628
01:09:30,034 --> 01:09:32,025
发射完毕
Last gun fired, sir.

629
01:09:32,103 --> 01:09:35,732
-时间?  -两分零一秒
-Timing? -Two minutes and one second, sir.

630
01:09:35,806 --> 01:09:41,142
各位  这太慢了  一定要比敌人快两倍
Lads, that's not good enough. We need to fire two broadsides to her one.

631
01:09:41,245 --> 01:09:44,442
-你们想被法国佬打败吗?  -不想
-Want to see a guillotine in Piccadilly? -No.

632
01:09:44,548 --> 01:09:47,745
-想让拿破仑当国王吗?  -不想
-Do you want to call Napoleon your king? -No.

633
01:09:47,818 --> 01:09:50,582
-想让小孩唱法国国歌吗  -不想
-Want your children to sing The Marseillaise? -No.

634
01:09:50,654 --> 01:09:53,919
准备到右舷开炮
Mr Mowett, Mr Pullings, starboard battery.

635
01:09:56,961 --> 01:10:00,260
动作要快整齐划一
Jump to it, lads. Cadence and rhythm.

636
01:10:02,933 --> 01:10:06,266
-瞄准目标  -快点
-Mark your targets. -Come on, lads, faster now.

637
01:10:06,337 --> 01:10:08,430
上弹药
Come on, swab it.

638
01:10:20,251 --> 01:10:22,651
哈伦跟上去
Heave.

639
01:10:22,753 --> 01:10:25,950
-报告  -我们准备好了
-Report, Mr Mowett. -Third and fourth divisions ready.

640
01:10:26,023 --> 01:10:28,924
好  右舷炮兵开炮
Right. Starboard battery, fire!

641
01:11:02,793 --> 01:11:04,988
一分十秒
One minute and ten seconds.

642
01:11:06,831 --> 01:11:09,493
干得好  大家都有酒喝
Well done, lads. Extra grog for all of you.

643
01:11:13,637 --> 01:11:16,071
让给船长过
Gangway for the captain, lads.

644
01:11:16,173 --> 01:11:18,835
进步很多  干得好
Marked improvement, Mr Calamy. Well done.

645
01:11:18,909 --> 01:11:21,002
谢谢你
Thank you, sir.

646
01:11:27,384 --> 01:11:32,822
基里克好了没  今晚吃什么?
Killick. Killick there. What do you have for us tonight?

647
01:11:32,890 --> 01:11:35,415
酒酿猪脸肉
Which it's soused hog's face.

648
01:11:35,526 --> 01:11:40,190
-酒酿猪脸肉  -我最爱吃的菜
-Which it is soused hog's face. -My favorite.

649
01:11:40,264 --> 01:11:46,897
*我们要把它轰回姥姥家...*
And when they run, the Surprise will blow her to kingdom come.

650
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:46,627
再过一礼拜他们就会被渴死
One more week of this and they'd give it up for a cup of water.

651
01:12:46,730 --> 01:12:48,891
我不会造雨
I can't make it rain.

652
01:12:50,768 --> 01:12:54,295
我只能驭风  我不是万能的
I can harness the wind, but I ain't its goddamn creator.

653
01:12:54,405 --> 01:12:57,067
我从来没碰过这种霉运
I have never known such a run of bad luck.

654
01:13:13,424 --> 01:13:19,329
"众人问他  灾祸是谁造成的?"
"And they said unto him 'For what caused the evil?"'

655
01:13:23,167 --> 01:13:25,499
他从哪儿蹦出这句话?
Where'd that come from?

656
01:13:26,437 --> 01:13:31,340
圣经  旧约圣经  约拿书
It's from the Bible, that. That is from the Bible. The story of the Jonah.

657
01:13:31,442 --> 01:13:35,310
他们在船上发现约拿...
They found out on their ship that one of their men...this Jonah cove...

658
01:13:35,379 --> 01:13:38,439
他触怒上帝  带来霉运
he'd offended God and was the cause of all their bad luck.

659
01:13:38,515 --> 01:13:44,147
邪恶来自心存邪念  做坏事的人
Evil comes from him who evil thinks and evil is.

660
01:13:44,221 --> 01:13:48,954
不  乔的确对邪恶略知一二
No. Joe knows a thing or two about evil.

661
01:13:49,827 --> 01:13:53,490
你有亲身经验对吧?
From personal experience. Right, Joe?

662
01:14:05,209 --> 01:14:07,656
基里克说的没错  
It's like Killick says. 

663
01:14:07,657 --> 01:14:10,647
那天早上他不敢击鼓备战
Morning of the battle, he doesn't have the guts to beat to quarters.

664
01:14:10,714 --> 01:14:15,344
结果他的手下都挂了  他一爬上后桅  瓦利就落海了
Then his entire gun crew's killed. Soon as he went up the mizzen, Will falls.

665
01:14:15,419 --> 01:14:19,219
换他值星  结果风就停了?
And whose watch was it when we lost our wind?

666
01:14:41,578 --> 01:14:44,206
你站住
You there. Stand fast.

667
01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:50,514
把他带下去  铐起来
Master-at-arms, take that man below and clap him in irons.

668
01:14:50,587 --> 01:14:54,114
第八钟响时举行鞭刑
Mr Pullings, defaulters at eight bells.

669
01:14:54,224 --> 01:14:55,919
遵命
Aye, sir.

670
01:14:57,361 --> 01:15:00,694
把哈伦带到我的舱房
Bring Hollom down to my cabin.

671
01:15:04,702 --> 01:15:07,967
你被他顶撞了怎么一句话也不说?
A man pushed past you, yet you said nothing. Why?

672
01:15:08,072 --> 01:15:10,973
我想说  却说不出口
I intended to, sir, but the right words didn't...

673
01:15:11,075 --> 01:15:16,274
说不出口?  他这是以下犯上
The right words? He was deliberately insubordinate.

674
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:19,440
我试着跟他们做朋友
I've tried to get to know the men, sir, and be friendly,

675
01:15:19,550 --> 01:15:22,986
他们却故意整我
but they've taken a set against me.

676
01:15:23,654 --> 01:15:28,489
老在我背后说我坏话  不停地给我白眼
Always whispering when I go past and giving me looks.

677
01:15:28,592 --> 01:15:31,493
以后我会对他们凶一点
I'll set that to rights. I'll be much tougher on them.

678
01:15:31,595 --> 01:15:35,122
你不能跟水手做朋友
You don't make friends with the foremastjacks, lad.

679
01:15:35,232 --> 01:15:39,498
他们会看不起你
They'll despise you in the end, think you weak.

680
01:15:39,603 --> 01:15:43,300
你也不必当暴君
-Nor do you need to be a tyrant. -No, sir.

681
01:15:43,407 --> 01:15:45,671
是  对不起
I'm very sorry, sir.

682
01:15:45,776 --> 01:15:49,177
-你26还是27岁?  -下礼拜就满30了
-You're 26? 27? -I'm 30 next Friday, sir.

683
01:15:49,279 --> 01:15:50,837
30
30?

684
01:15:50,948 --> 01:15:54,179
你两次考上尉都没过
You've failed to pass for lieutenant twice.

685
01:15:54,284 --> 01:15:59,153
你表现不差  也有航海知识  你不能一辈子都当见习官
I know you have, but you're not a bad sailor. You can't spend your life a midshipman.

686
01:15:59,256 --> 01:16:02,851
是的  我会更努力
No, sir. I will try much harder, sir.

687
01:16:04,428 --> 01:16:07,829
听好  他们需要的是领导
Look, Hollom, it's leadership they want.

688
01:16:07,931 --> 01:16:09,956
还有力量
Strength.

689
01:16:10,033 --> 01:16:15,494
找出自身那种特质  就会得到他们的尊敬
You find that within yourself, and you will earn their respect.

690
01:16:17,107 --> 01:16:20,668
没有尊敬哪来的纪律?
Without respect, true discipline goes by the board.

691
01:16:21,779 --> 01:16:24,543
是的
Yes, sir.

692
01:16:24,648 --> 01:16:29,711
力量  尊敬  还有纪律
Strength, respect and discipline, sir.

693
01:16:33,657 --> 01:16:37,616
这是件很遗憾的事
It's an unfortunate business, Hollom.

694
01:16:38,629 --> 01:16:41,462
实在遗憾
Damned unfortunate.

695
01:16:42,199 --> 01:16:45,066
-下去吧  -是
-That'll be all. -Yes, sir.

696
01:16:48,338 --> 01:16:52,331
-我也不喜欢鞭刑  -大家都认为是哈伦...
-I am not a flogging captain. -Hollom is a scapegoat for all the bad luck,

697
01:16:52,409 --> 01:16:55,708
带来霉运
real or imagined, on this voyage.

698
01:16:55,813 --> 01:16:58,338
请你过来
Mr Lamb? If you please.

699
01:16:58,415 --> 01:17:01,680
他们都筋疲力尽
They're exhausted. These men are exhausted.

700
01:17:01,752 --> 01:17:04,653
你把他们操练得太凶
You've pushed them too hard.

701
01:17:04,721 --> 01:17:08,384
我是请你来跟我聊天
Stephen, I invite you to this cabin as my friend.

702
01:17:08,492 --> 01:17:12,758
不是质疑我的命令
Not to criticize nor to comment on my command.

703
01:17:12,863 --> 01:17:18,392
我是不是该等你气消了才来?
Shall I leave you until you're in a more harmonious frame of mind?

704
01:17:19,670 --> 01:17:23,436
-你要我怎样?  -把船上的酒都倒掉
-What would you have me do? -Tip the ship's grog over the side.

705
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:26,998
-不给他们喝酒?  -纳格当时喝醉了
-Stop their grog? -Nagle was drunk when he insulted Hollom.

706
01:17:27,077 --> 01:17:30,376
你要我取消两百年的传统
Stop 200 years of privilege and tradition.

707
01:17:30,447 --> 01:17:33,610
他们有酒喝就不会叛变
I'd rather have them three sheets to the wind than face a mutiny.

708
01:17:33,717 --> 01:17:36,015
我倒能理解他们会想叛变
I'm rather understanding of mutinies.

709
01:17:36,086 --> 01:17:40,921
他们离乡背井  被困在监狱一般的船上...
Men pressed from their homes, confined for months aboard a wooden prison...

710
01:17:41,024 --> 01:17:47,793
我很尊重你的意见  但是我不能承受船员叛变
I respect your right to disagree with me, but I can only afford one rebel on this ship

711
01:17:49,233 --> 01:17:53,533
你看不起海军就是看不起我
I hate it when you talk of the service in this way. It makes me so very low.

712
01:17:53,604 --> 01:17:55,367
你以为我想鞭打纳格吗?
You think I want to flog Nagle?

713
01:17:55,439 --> 01:17:59,034
他跟我切断绳子  害他好友送死
A man who hacked the ropes that sent his mate to his death?

714
01:17:59,109 --> 01:18:01,976
在我的命令下
Under my orders?

715
01:18:02,079 --> 01:18:06,413
看到没  没有纪律  这艘船就会一团混乱
Do you not see? The only things that keep this wooden world together are hard work...

716
01:18:06,483 --> 01:18:08,917
他只是没向长官敬礼
Jack, the man failed to salute.

717
01:18:08,986 --> 01:18:11,716
连大自然都有阶级之分
There's hierarchies even in nature.

718
01:18:11,788 --> 01:18:17,055
-大自然没有鄙视和羞辱  -不管他们是不行的
-There is no disdain in nature. There is no... -Men must be governed.

719
01:18:17,127 --> 01:18:19,652
有时候管不好 但一定要管
Often not wisely, but governed nonetheless.

720
01:18:19,763 --> 01:18:24,063
这是史上每个暴君的藉口 从尼禄到拿破仑都一样
That's the excuse of every tyrant in history, from Nero to Bonaparte.

721
01:18:24,134 --> 01:18:28,264
我反对独裁专制 那只会带来痛苦与迫害
I, for one, am opposed to authority. It is an egg of misery and oppression.

722
01:18:28,338 --> 01:18:32,798
你想搞革命来错地方了
You've come to the wrong shop for anarchy, brother.

723
01:18:35,646 --> 01:18:37,477
四
Four.

724
01:18:38,949 --> 01:18:40,314
五
Five.

725
01:18:42,619 --> 01:18:44,280
六
Six.

726
01:18:45,522 --> 01:18:47,319
七
Seven.

727
01:18:48,592 --> 01:18:50,116
八
Eight.

728
01:18:50,827 --> 01:18:52,590
九
Nine.

729
01:18:54,965 --> 01:18:56,830
十
Ten.

730
01:18:57,935 --> 01:18:59,129
十一
Eleven.

731
01:19:01,171 --> 01:19:03,139
十二
Twelve.

732
01:19:06,143 --> 01:19:08,338
把他放下来
Cut him down.

733
01:19:32,302 --> 01:19:34,668
轻声一点
Not so loud.

734
01:20:28,792 --> 01:20:31,454
把刀子放下来
Put that dirk down, Boyle.

735
01:20:33,964 --> 01:20:36,558
你没事吧?
You OK, Mr Hollom?

736
01:20:36,633 --> 01:20:39,727
-他没病  只是想偷懒  跟以前一样  -闭嘴
-He's not ill, just dodging work as usual. -Shut up.

737
01:20:39,803 --> 01:20:42,897
-你闭嘴  -别管他
-You shut up. -Just leave him be.

738
01:20:42,973 --> 01:20:45,965
-喝一点水  -谢谢你
-Have some water. -Thank you.

739
01:20:50,213 --> 01:20:52,545
哈伦生病了
Sir, it's Mr Hollom.

740
01:20:59,656 --> 01:21:05,617
他的身体没病  他认为自己受到诅咒
There's nothing physically wrong with him. He thinks he's been cursed.

741
01:21:07,397 --> 01:21:11,094
水手什么都不怕  只怕碰到瘟神
Sailors can abide a great deal, but not a Jonah.

742
01:21:11,768 --> 01:21:14,828
你怎么也信怪力乱神这一套
My God. You believe it too.

743
01:21:16,506 --> 01:21:19,964
不是每件事都有科学根据的
Not everything is in your books, Stephen.

744
01:21:26,483 --> 01:21:28,417
就是他对吧?
It's him, innit?

745
01:21:30,987 --> 01:21:33,979
他是瘟神
The Jonah.

746
01:21:34,091 --> 01:21:36,082
都是他害的
He's causing it.

747
01:21:38,595 --> 01:21:41,826
鬼船是他召来的
He's callin' it up, don't you see?

748
01:21:41,932 --> 01:21:46,596
每次他值星  那艘船就会出现
Every time he's on watch, that ship appears.

749
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:52,702
等着瞧吧
You wait and see.

750
01:21:52,809 --> 01:21:57,803
今晚他值星  鬼船一定会出现
Anytime tonight, that ghost ship's gonna turn up.

751
01:21:58,982 --> 01:22:03,783
它会把我们带到十八层地狱
And it's gonna take us all with it, straight down to the hot place.

752
01:22:24,474 --> 01:22:26,806
哈伦
Mr Hollom.

753
01:22:26,877 --> 01:22:29,573
你吓了我一大跳
You gave me such a start.

754
01:22:32,048 --> 01:22:34,209
你好点了吗?
Are you feeling better now?

755
01:22:34,317 --> 01:22:37,844
好多了  谢谢
Yes. Much better, thank you.

756
01:22:49,166 --> 01:22:53,535
船长说明天就会起风
The captain thinks we'll get our wind tomorrow.

757
01:22:53,603 --> 01:22:55,696
一定会的
I'm sure of it.

758
01:23:24,634 --> 01:23:28,195
你一直都对我很好
You've always been very kind to me.

759
01:23:35,278 --> 01:23:37,712
再见了  布雷克尼
Goodbye, Blakeney.

760
01:24:27,518 --> 01:24:29,611
约拿书

761
01:24:45,982 --> 01:24:50,783
事实是  不是所有人都能如愿以偿
The simple truth is, not all of us become the men we once hoped we might be.

762
01:24:50,854 --> 01:24:53,823
但我们都是上帝的子民
But we are all God's creatures.

763
01:24:56,559 --> 01:25:00,893
如果有人对哈伦有微词
If there are those among us who thought ill of Mr Hollom,

764
01:25:01,831 --> 01:25:04,527
说过他坏话
or spoke ill of him,

765
01:25:06,236 --> 01:25:09,865
或是瞧不起他这个人
or failed him in respect of fellowship,

766
01:25:11,141 --> 01:25:14,668
我们乞求上帝的原谅
then we ask for your forgiveness, Lord.

767
01:25:14,744 --> 01:25:16,905
还有他的原谅
And we ask for his.

768
01:25:32,696 --> 01:25:35,256
赞美上帝
God be praised. Mr Mowett?

769
01:26:00,623 --> 01:26:03,091
停在那儿
Avast there.

770
01:26:16,806 --> 01:26:19,934
-有只鸟跟着我们  -什么鸟?
-Doctor, have you seen the bird? -What sort of bird?

771
01:26:20,043 --> 01:26:26,972
有点像信天翁  要不然就是大个海鸥  它又来了
Some sort of albatross. Either that, or he's a prodigious great mew. There it goes.

772
01:26:33,323 --> 01:26:37,259
那儿  它是我的
There he is. My bird. Damn.

773
01:26:38,928 --> 01:26:40,896
它在兜圈子
It's circling, lads.

774
01:26:48,004 --> 01:26:49,062
医生
Doctor?

775
01:26:49,139 --> 01:26:51,471
天  医生
My God. Doctor.

776
01:26:52,909 --> 01:26:57,744
对不起  那只鸟冲下来  我没看到你
I'm so sorry, man. The bird dropped low. I didn't see you.

777
01:27:00,450 --> 01:27:03,681
-科勒米  快去叫希根  -我没事
-Calamy, get Higgins. -I'm fine, Jack.

778
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:19,998
子弹把一块布打进去了
The bullet took in a piece of shirt with it.

779
01:27:20,103 --> 01:27:25,131
不取出来就会生脓溃烂
Unless it's removed, it's gonna suppurate and fester.

780
01:27:25,208 --> 01:27:27,176
你行吗?
Are you equal to the task?

781
01:27:27,277 --> 01:27:33,341
我先得看医生的书  研究一些图片
I'll need to read up on the doctor's books. Study some pictures he has.

782
01:27:33,450 --> 01:27:35,350
研究图片?
Study some pictures?

783
01:27:35,452 --> 01:27:38,512
先让我搞清状况
It's just to get my bearings, that's all.

784
01:27:38,621 --> 01:27:45,220
在陆地上比较容易  不会摇摇晃晃
It'd be a lot easier if I were on dry land. You wouldn't have the...

785
01:27:45,328 --> 01:27:47,819
我行的  等着瞧
I'll manage. You'll see.

786
01:28:12,255 --> 01:28:15,986
海平线上有船帆  往西
Sail on the horizon, sir. Running west.

787
01:28:16,526 --> 01:28:19,393
我们不确定  但应该就是它
We're not sure, but we think it's her, sir.

788
01:28:23,333 --> 01:28:25,324
要去...
Better get...

789
01:28:26,703 --> 01:28:28,762
再见了医生
Goodbye, sir.

790
01:28:47,056 --> 01:28:51,117
就是那艘法国船
No mistakin' it. She's the Frenchie.

791
01:28:58,701 --> 01:29:01,864
你要击鼓备战吗?
Shall we beat to quarters, sir?

792
01:29:40,276 --> 01:29:42,767
跟我说  这是不是为了我
Tell me this wasn't on my account.

793
01:29:42,845 --> 01:29:47,976
当然不是  我只想下来走走  伸伸腿
No, not at all. I just needed to stretch my legs.

794
01:29:49,686 --> 01:29:52,120
轻点
Gently there.

795
01:29:58,861 --> 01:30:02,661
快点  准备好
Briskly now. Secure this line.

796
01:30:02,765 --> 01:30:06,030
每20码都有陆战队员驻守
Royal Marines posted every 20 yards, sir.

797
01:30:17,113 --> 01:30:19,673
-准备好了吗?  -好了
-All set, Higgins? -Yes, sir.

798
01:30:19,782 --> 01:30:22,182
不
No.

799
01:30:22,785 --> 01:30:25,777
我要自己来
I do this with my own hand.

800
01:30:31,227 --> 01:30:34,321
没事的话我就出去等
If everything is under control, I'll just be outside.

801
01:30:34,397 --> 01:30:37,491
你的手很稳  我需要你
A spare pair of steady hands wouldn't go amiss.

802
01:30:37,567 --> 01:30:43,062
除非你见到血就会昏倒
That is, if, of course, you have the constitution for this kind of thing.

803
01:30:43,473 --> 01:30:51,380
亲爱的医生  我什么血腥的场面都见过了
My dear doctor, I have been amongst and around wounds all my life.

804
01:30:51,914 --> 01:30:54,075
那就好
Good, then.

805
01:30:54,183 --> 01:30:59,246
把手放在我肚子上  我会叫你用力按
Put your hand on my belly, pressing firmly when I give the word.

806
01:30:59,355 --> 01:31:02,813
希根  手术刀
Higgins, the catling, if you please.

807
01:31:10,266 --> 01:31:12,530
巴丁  镜子
Padeen, please.

808
01:31:25,782 --> 01:31:28,273
探测器
The sounder, Mr Higgins.

809
01:31:29,686 --> 01:31:31,745
擦血
Swab.

810
01:31:41,798 --> 01:31:43,891
好
All right.

811
01:31:46,803 --> 01:31:50,068
希根  你要帮我把肋骨撑开来
Mr Higgins, you'll have to raise the rib.

812
01:31:52,875 --> 01:31:57,107
用力握住牵引器
Take a good grip with the square retractor.

813
01:32:00,583 --> 01:32:02,778
插进去
Right in.

814
01:32:02,885 --> 01:32:04,819
往上扳
And lift up.

815
01:32:04,921 --> 01:32:06,388
往上
Lift up.

816
01:32:19,469 --> 01:32:22,063
帮我擦血  我看不到
Swab, Jack. I can't see.

817
01:32:26,442 --> 01:32:29,468
你还好吧?
Are you all right?

818
01:32:39,455 --> 01:32:41,514
夹到了
I got it.

819
01:32:53,169 --> 01:32:55,467
按用力一点
A tad more pressure.

820
01:33:06,315 --> 01:33:09,011
-全都在吗?  -对
-Is that all of it? -Aye, sir.

821
01:33:09,719 --> 01:33:11,949
能完全缝回去
She'll patch up nicely.

822
01:33:12,021 --> 01:33:13,955
谢天谢地
Thank God I got it.

823
01:33:59,735 --> 01:34:01,566
很好喝
That's good.

824
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:14,914
-我跟巴丁替你采集样本?  -真的吗?
-Padeen and I have been collecting for you. -Have you really?

825
01:34:15,017 --> 01:34:18,612
我连甲虫栖息的植物也带回来了
The beetles each come with a specimen of the plant they were found on.

826
01:34:18,721 --> 01:34:21,189
那只逃走了
Padeen, that one's got away.

827
01:34:21,257 --> 01:34:25,523
你要是愿意看的话  我做了一些笔记
Sir, I've made a few notes, if you want to see them.

828
01:34:41,544 --> 01:34:45,571
布雷克尼  你有当自然学家的料
Mr Blakeney, it would appear that you have the makings of a naturalist.

829
01:34:45,648 --> 01:34:52,577
我可以跟你一样文武双全
Perhaps I could combine them to be a sort of fighting naturalist, like you, sir.

830
01:34:54,757 --> 01:34:58,090
战争和科学不太搭轧
They don't combine too well, I find.

831
01:34:58,160 --> 01:34:59,218
好
Right.

832
01:34:59,295 --> 01:35:01,661
你还不能起来吧?
Should you really be getting up, sir?

833
01:35:01,764 --> 01:35:05,222
-你也是医生吗?  -不是
-Mr Blakeney, are you also a doctor? -No, sir.

834
01:35:05,301 --> 01:35:08,737
没错  巴丁  扶我
No, you're not. Padeen, if you please.

835
01:35:15,177 --> 01:35:19,614
你知道船长打算待多久吗?
How long does the captain intend that we stay? Do you know?

836
01:35:21,484 --> 01:35:23,952
-一个礼拜吧  -一礼拜?
-Oh, a week perhaps. -A week?

837
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:28,081
-我并不急  -不是该去马克萨斯吗?
-There's no great hurry. -Mustn't we make haste for the Marquesas?

838
01:35:28,157 --> 01:35:31,092
我都不确定那是不是 "地狱号"
I'm not even sure it was the Acheron we sighted.

839
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:34,033
就算是它也早就走远了  
And if it was, she'll be well away by now. 

840
01:35:34,034 --> 01:35:36,188
要找到它是海底捞针
Like looking for an honest man in parliament.

841
01:35:36,299 --> 01:35:41,430
趁英法和谈之前回家吧
No, we shall head home. Before peace breaks out with France, God forbid.

842
01:35:45,041 --> 01:35:48,477
你这份恩情我恐怕无法报答
I fear you may have burdened me with a debt I can never repay.

843
01:35:48,544 --> 01:35:53,777
用我的名字替灌木命名  全身带刺难以消灭的那种
Tosh. Name a shrub after me. Something prickly and hard to eradicate.

844
01:35:53,849 --> 01:35:58,513
灌木?  才不要  我要用你的名字替大乌龟命名
A shrub? Nonsense. I'll name a great tortoise after you.

845
01:35:58,621 --> 01:36:01,385
欧氏海龟
Testudo aubreii.

846
01:36:43,065 --> 01:36:46,398
东西收一收  该走了
Come on, pack up your things. We should be going.

847
01:36:46,502 --> 01:36:49,699
-回营地吗?  -不  到小岛另一端
-Back to camp, sir? -No, to the other side of the island.

848
01:36:49,772 --> 01:36:54,232
-至少要走十英里路  -那就更一刻也不能耽搁
-But, sir, that must be at least ten miles. -Then there's not a moment to lose.

849
01:36:54,343 --> 01:36:57,335
我在那儿看到过不会飞的鸬鹚
That's where I saw my flightless cormorant.

850
01:36:57,413 --> 01:36:59,347
走吧
Come on.

851
01:37:10,259 --> 01:37:13,228
长七英寸
Seven inches in length.

852
01:37:14,230 --> 01:37:16,255
宽四英寸
Four inches wide.

853
01:37:16,365 --> 01:37:18,856
颈长十五英寸
15-inches-long neck.

854
01:37:19,935 --> 01:37:24,269
最宽处的宽度是六英寸
Width at the widest point, six inches.

855
01:37:30,312 --> 01:37:33,873
可以用手抓它们  不会咬人
Padeen, put the net down and use your hands. They won't bite.

856
01:37:33,949 --> 01:37:36,213
这只不错
Here's a good one.

857
01:37:37,953 --> 01:37:40,717
小心抓
Pick them up carefully.

858
01:37:41,323 --> 01:37:44,224
我们该回去了
Sir, I think we should be getting back.

859
01:37:44,293 --> 01:37:49,788
在这儿军纪一点也没有用  我一定要找到鸬鹚
Naval discipline doesn't operate out here, Mr Blakeney. I must find that cormorant.

860
01:37:49,899 --> 01:37:52,561
要是它真的不会飞
And should it indeed prove flightless,

861
01:37:52,635 --> 01:37:56,469
你可以跟我并列名为发现者
you can join me at the Royal Society dinner as co-discoverer.

862
01:39:36,906 --> 01:39:39,204
我们要快一点
Sir, we must hurry.

863
01:39:41,410 --> 01:39:47,110
你来背他  放下来  别管了
Padeen, you must carry him. Put those down. Leave them. Just put everything down.

864
01:39:50,619 --> 01:39:53,383
把笼子打开
Open the cages.

865
01:40:07,803 --> 01:40:12,706
-快上船  各就各位  -方向舵向右
-All hands, unmoor ship. -Mr Allen, I'll have her on a starboard tack.

866
01:40:12,775 --> 01:40:15,972
帮忙把乌龟放好
Let's have hands to stow these tortoises.

867
01:40:16,078 --> 01:40:20,139
波登  方向舵向右
Barret Bonden, put your helm hard to starboard.

868
01:40:22,218 --> 01:40:25,619
它往南航行了两个钟头
He has a head start of two hours on us and he's bearing south.

869
01:40:25,721 --> 01:40:29,418
目的地一定是查理王岛  它在找清水
That can only mean King Charles Island. He's looking for water.

870
01:40:29,491 --> 01:40:36,659
就算追得上去也无法偷袭它  除非我们能隐形
If we caught up with her, to take her, we'd have to be bloody invisible.

871
01:40:37,900 --> 01:40:40,835
帆往右舷拉
Brace the yards to starboard.

872
01:40:50,112 --> 01:40:53,240
史蒂芬  你发现那只鸟了吗?
So, Stephen, did you get to see your bird?

873
01:40:53,315 --> 01:40:57,308
没有  不过...其实有啦  只是没办法抓到
No. Well, yes, but I couldn't catch one.

874
01:40:58,020 --> 01:41:00,989
我最大的发现是那艘鬼船
My greatest discovery was your phantom.

875
01:41:01,090 --> 01:41:06,118
没错  很遗憾你得把样本丢掉
Indeed it was. I'm sorry you had to leave the majority of your collection behind.

876
01:41:06,195 --> 01:41:12,191
其实呢  我跟威尔有一样有趣的发现
In actual fact, Mr Blakeney and I did make one very interesting find.

877
01:41:12,301 --> 01:41:14,963
是吗?
Is that right?

878
01:41:15,037 --> 01:41:17,301
让我猜猜  这是一根树枝?
Let me guess. A stick?

879
01:41:24,446 --> 01:41:26,505
告诉他
Tell him about it, Mr Blakeney.

880
01:41:26,615 --> 01:41:29,982
-这是罕见的竹节虫  -竹节虫?
-It's a rare phasmid, sir. -A phasmid?

881
01:41:30,052 --> 01:41:36,548
它为了躲避掠食者  可以伪装成树枝
It's an insect that disguises itself as a stick in order to confuse its predators.

882
01:42:04,708 --> 01:42:07,108
"妖女号"

883
01:42:28,877 --> 01:42:31,107
这也算是一种伪装
A nautical phasmid, Doctor.

884
01:42:31,213 --> 01:42:36,207
对敌人来说这就是一艘捕鲸船
At least, to a hungry eye, if one has an appetite for whalers.

885
01:42:36,285 --> 01:42:40,619
我打算从现在开始  多了解自然生物
I intend to take a greater interest in the bounty of nature from now on.

886
01:42:40,723 --> 01:42:45,251
没想到研究自然生态也能有助于提高海上战略水平
I had no idea that a study of nature could advance the art of naval warfare.

887
01:42:45,361 --> 01:42:47,352
我懂了
I see.

888
01:42:47,429 --> 01:42:50,557
我要设下陷阱逮这个掠食者
Now to pull this predator in close and spring our trap.

889
01:42:50,632 --> 01:42:52,122
-杰克?  -在
-Jack? -Yes.

890
01:42:52,234 --> 01:42:55,067
你才是掠食者
You're the predator.

891
01:42:56,305 --> 01:43:01,402
在那儿看不到船身
There. Hull-down, broad off the larboard bow.

892
01:43:01,477 --> 01:43:03,411
就是它  没错
That's a frigate, all right.

893
01:43:03,479 --> 01:43:06,710
你的眼力真好
Damn, you've got good eyes, Barret.

894
01:43:06,782 --> 01:43:10,912
浓烟再多一点
-Mr Allen. More smoke. -Aye, sir.

895
01:43:10,986 --> 01:43:13,614
这样就能把它引过来
That'll bring 'em about.

896
01:43:24,466 --> 01:43:29,267
擦干净才会射得更直更准
That's it, lads. Clean 'em up so they fly straight and true.

897
01:43:31,807 --> 01:43:34,901
打火石要放进去
Let's have fresh flints in all the locks.

898
01:43:44,019 --> 01:43:48,854
把左舷大炮后轮卸下来
Larboard battery, unship your rear wheels.

899
01:43:53,362 --> 01:43:55,455
放下来
Drop the gun.

900
01:43:58,667 --> 01:44:02,296
-基里克  你也要换衣服  -天
-Come on, Killick, you too. Get dressed. -Oh, God.

901
01:44:02,371 --> 01:44:05,306
-汤姆  -一切准备就绪
-Tom? -Our preparations are completed, sir.

902
01:44:05,374 --> 01:44:10,107
很好  现在起  不准叫我长官  不准敬礼  不准鸣笛...
Good. Right, from now on no "sirs," no salutes, no whistles, no bells.

903
01:44:10,179 --> 01:44:11,840
是  长官
Aye, sir.

904
01:44:11,947 --> 01:44:15,542
...我们都不太习惯
Yes, I think we're all finding that quite difficult.

905
01:44:16,485 --> 01:44:19,477
地狱号上关了30名捕鲸船员
There'll be 30 or more whalers locked in the Acheron's hold.

906
01:44:19,555 --> 01:44:22,956
科勒米负责率人营救他们
After we board, Mr Calamy should take a party and free them.

907
01:44:23,025 --> 01:44:26,893
-他行吗?  -当年你行吗?
-You think him ready, sir? -Were you ready, Tom?

908
01:44:26,995 --> 01:44:29,793
-也许他能扭转战局  -没错
-He may well turn the tide. -Indeed, sir.

909
01:44:40,375 --> 01:44:42,639
它上钩了  转向
She's taken the bait. Let's come about.

910
01:44:42,711 --> 01:44:46,738
装成捕鲸船员  动作慌张
Make a show of fleeing, panicky and disorganized, like a whaler might.

911
01:44:46,849 --> 01:44:49,249
除了霍格以外
Present company excepted, Mr Hogg.

912
01:44:49,351 --> 01:44:51,216
各就各位  快点  别让他们看到
Hurry up, or they'll see you.

913
01:44:51,320 --> 01:44:55,552
别管了  快上来扮成捕鲸船员
Eckhart, leave that. Just come up quick and get some whaler's slops on.

914
01:45:08,737 --> 01:45:12,696
-恭喜了  彼得  你升了三副   -谢谢
-Congratulations. Acting third lieutenant. -Thank you.

915
01:45:12,774 --> 01:45:17,507
-听说我们要去营救捕鲸船员  -你要在后甲板留守
-I hear we're to free the whalers. -You're to be stationed on the quarterdeck.

916
01:45:17,579 --> 01:45:20,013
很遗憾
I'm sorry, Will.

917
01:45:21,950 --> 01:45:27,411
我要你们把船开得歪七扭八  让它迎风追上来
Make a bad show of keeping your course. Let her run up and luff every now and then.

918
01:45:28,223 --> 01:45:31,192
-对不起  -把帽子脱下来  我们是捕鲸人
-Excuse me, sir. -Remove your hat. We're whalers.

919
01:45:31,260 --> 01:45:35,458
我想跟你谈谈  科勒米说我不能登船进攻...
Mr Calamy says I'm not on the boarding party. I want to say...

920
01:45:35,564 --> 01:45:39,625
我知道你想说什么  我的答案是不行
I know what you want to say. And my answer is no.

921
01:45:39,735 --> 01:45:44,104
你要率领你的炮兵  等我登上敌舰后指挥这艘船
You'll lead your gun crew, then when we board, you'll take command of the ship.

922
01:45:44,206 --> 01:45:48,575
-你明白吗?  -你要我指挥这艘船?  谢谢
-Do I make myself clear? -Take command of the ship? Thank you, sir.

923
01:45:48,644 --> 01:45:51,204
-回到岗位上  -是
-Back to your station. -Yes, sir.

924
01:45:54,383 --> 01:45:57,580
绑在右手辨别敌我
On your right upper arm, to tell friend from foe.

925
01:45:57,653 --> 01:46:00,281
绑在这只手  你的右手
Davies, this arm. Starboard arm.

926
01:46:00,389 --> 01:46:04,120
-是你断的那只手吗?  -说话小心点
-Is that the arm you got or don't got? -Less of that cheek, Davies.

927
01:46:04,226 --> 01:46:07,992
把领巾绑在右臂
Take your neck cloths and put them round your right upper arm.

928
01:46:08,096 --> 01:46:10,656
船长来了
Make way for the captain.

929
01:46:12,067 --> 01:46:14,126
恭喜了  三副
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

930
01:46:14,236 --> 01:46:15,760
很好  伙伴们
Right, lads.

931
01:46:15,837 --> 01:46:18,169
我知道你们都很英勇
I know there's not a faint heart among you,

932
01:46:18,273 --> 01:46:22,073
你们跟我一样很想杀敌报国
and I know you're as anxious as I am to get into close action.

933
01:46:22,144 --> 01:46:25,739
但是我们要先把他们引过来
But we must bring him right up beside us before we spring this trap.

934
01:46:25,814 --> 01:46:27,805
这要考验我们的胆识
That will test our nerve.

935
01:46:27,916 --> 01:46:31,977
还有纪律  跟勇气一样重要
And discipline will count just as much as courage.

936
01:46:32,087 --> 01:46:37,491
地狱号不好对付  大炮和船员比我们多两倍
The Acheron is a tough nut to crack. More than twice our guns and numbers.

937
01:46:37,593 --> 01:46:40,824
他们会顽强抵抗
And they will sell their lives dearly.

938
01:46:42,664 --> 01:46:46,930
掌帆员  你们要先装得笨手笨脚
Topmen, your handling of the sheets to be lubberly and un-navylike,

939
01:46:47,002 --> 01:46:49,664
等我下令就把帆一收
until the signal to spill the wind from our sails.

940
01:46:49,771 --> 01:46:53,172
我们就会停下来
This will bring us almost to a complete stop.

941
01:46:53,275 --> 01:46:56,870
炮兵要迅速把大炮推出炮门
Gun crews, you must run out and tie down in double-quick time.

942
01:46:56,979 --> 01:46:59,756
没有后轮能射得更高  
With the rear wheels removed you've gained elevation, 

943
01:46:59,757 --> 01:47:02,281
但是却不能重新装弹药
but without recoil you can't reload.

944
01:47:02,351 --> 01:47:07,653
所以左舷大炮只能开一次炮  记着  只能开一次
So, gun captains, that gives you one shot from the larboard battery. One shot only.

945
01:47:07,723 --> 01:47:12,524
瞄准主桅射击  一定要把它击倒
You'll fire for her mainmast. Much will depend on your accuracy.

946
01:47:12,628 --> 01:47:18,967
它就算动不了也很危险  就像受伤的野兽
However, even crippled she will still be dangerous, like a wounded beast.

947
01:47:21,903 --> 01:47:23,962
霍华德队长率领你的陆战队员...
Captain Howard and the marines

948
01:47:24,039 --> 01:47:28,339
要用回旋炮跟毛瑟枪  攻击对方的露天甲板
will sweep their weather deck with swivel gun and musket fire from the tops.

949
01:47:28,410 --> 01:47:31,470
先替我们解决一些敌人
They'll try and even the odds for us before we board.

950
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:36,809
他们把这艘船当成大肥羊
They mean to take us as a prize.

951
01:47:36,885 --> 01:47:43,586
这艘船如果没有损坏会比较值钱  他们的贪心会害他们送命
And we are worth more to them undamaged. Their greed will be their downfall.

952
01:47:45,427 --> 01:47:48,260
祖国受到入侵者威胁
England is under threat of invasion.

953
01:47:48,363 --> 01:47:52,527
这艘船就是我们的家园
And though we be on the far side of the world, this ship is our home.

954
01:47:54,169 --> 01:47:57,036
这艘船就是祖国
This ship is England.

955
01:48:00,175 --> 01:48:04,703
大家都要坚守岗位  以迅雷不及掩耳之速进攻
So it's every hand to his rope or gun. Quick's the word and sharp's the action.

956
01:48:04,780 --> 01:48:08,216
杀他个措手不及屁滚尿流
After all, surprise is on our side.

957
01:48:19,695 --> 01:48:22,596
丢高一点  让他们看到
-Toss them high so they can see them. -Hello, Doctor.

958
01:48:22,698 --> 01:48:24,063
杰克
Jack.

959
01:48:24,132 --> 01:48:26,396
-抽根雪茄  -不了谢谢
-Care for a cigar? -Thank you, no.

960
01:48:26,468 --> 01:48:29,062
这是你的
If you please, Doctor.

961
01:48:30,472 --> 01:48:33,737
-我替你叫了咖啡  -谢谢
-I took the liberty, Doctor. -Thank you, Killick.

962
01:48:33,809 --> 01:48:38,473
-我加了三块方糖  -你真好心
-There's three lumps in there. -How kind.

963
01:49:33,268 --> 01:49:35,759
-祝好运  威尔  -好运
-Good luck, Will. -Good luck, Peter.

964
01:49:37,539 --> 01:49:41,100
-待会见  -好
-See you afterwards. -And you.

965
01:49:42,144 --> 01:49:45,773
稳住  保持冷静
Steady now, lads. Keep calm.

966
01:49:48,216 --> 01:49:51,811
"妖女号" 捕鲸船  这是地狱号
English whaler Syren, this is Acheron.

967
01:49:53,655 --> 01:49:58,456
你们已经无处可逃  这算是警告
You have no possibility, no chance. But you have had warning.

968
01:49:58,527 --> 01:50:01,985
不停船就把你们炸毁
Stop now, or we will destroy your ship.

969
01:50:02,063 --> 01:50:05,499
英国捕鲸船  这是最后的警告
English whaler, this is your last warning.

970
01:50:05,567 --> 01:50:09,867
不停船就把你们炸毁
Stop now, or we will destroy you.

971
01:50:09,971 --> 01:50:12,201
大家上
Let fly!

972
01:50:14,176 --> 01:50:17,976
拖过去
Haul your yards there.

973
01:50:19,314 --> 01:50:21,475
快点
Run out, boys.

974
01:50:21,550 --> 01:50:22,710
开炮
Fire!

975
01:50:23,919 --> 01:50:25,716
开炮
Fire!

976
01:50:34,596 --> 01:50:37,258
瞄准主桅
For the mainmast, lads.

977
01:50:44,239 --> 01:50:46,707
-让我过去  -开炮
-Let me through. -Fire!

978
01:51:14,302 --> 01:51:16,395
向左急转
Hard a-larboard.

979
01:51:17,105 --> 01:51:19,630
张起前桅帆和中桅帆
Right the headsails. Set the topsails.

980
01:51:19,741 --> 01:51:21,038
升起来
Heave.

981
01:51:22,110 --> 01:51:24,977
快到右舷
Man the starboard battery.

982
01:51:31,119 --> 01:51:33,485
看到目标就开炮
Fire as she bears.

983
01:51:53,975 --> 01:51:56,944
接近
Get to it.

984
01:51:57,012 --> 01:51:59,640
被主桅挡住  过不去
It's the fallen mast. We can't lay alongside.

985
01:51:59,748 --> 01:52:02,774
划小艇试着过去  我会尽量掩护你们
Cross the wreckage as best you can. I'll draw their fire.

986
01:52:02,851 --> 01:52:06,810
-跟普灵一起去  -收起中桅帆
-My division to join Mr Pullings. -Clew up topsails.

987
01:52:06,922 --> 01:52:09,914
幸运杰克万岁
Huzzah for Lucky Jack.

988
01:52:09,991 --> 01:52:12,619
抛出勾绳
Grappling hooks away.

989
01:52:12,694 --> 01:52:15,128
放下登船跳板
Run out the boarding planks.

990
01:52:17,265 --> 01:52:22,430
-跟我来  -为了祖国和这只大肥羊
-My division, follow me. -For England, for home, and for the prize.

991
01:52:23,038 --> 01:52:25,632
冲啊
Here we go, lads.

992
01:52:29,811 --> 01:52:31,870
别出声  安静
Pipe down. Silence.

993
01:52:54,669 --> 01:52:56,660
看来他们全军覆没
Looks like the job is done, sir.

994
01:52:56,738 --> 01:52:58,501
地狱号
Acheron.

995
01:53:12,821 --> 01:53:14,015
开火
Fire!

996
01:53:30,739 --> 01:53:33,105
布雷克尼  快开炮
Mr Blakeney, the nine-pounder.

997
01:53:33,208 --> 01:53:35,073
来吧
That's it.

998
01:53:35,176 --> 01:53:36,234
开炮
Fire!

999
01:53:37,545 --> 01:53:39,843
继续前进  前进
Keep moving, men. Keep moving.

1000
01:54:28,963 --> 01:54:30,828
乔
Joe.

1001
01:54:36,738 --> 01:54:38,330
丢炸弹
Grenades, ready.

1002
01:54:48,516 --> 01:54:51,485
他们瞄准了我们
They're aiming for our hull.

1003
01:54:51,586 --> 01:54:54,248
想把我们炸沉  炮管朝下
They could sink us. Depress the muzzle.

1004
01:54:54,322 --> 01:54:56,347
把后面抬起来
Padeen, train it aft.

1005
01:54:56,458 --> 01:54:58,119
消灭敌人
Together now.

1006
01:54:59,027 --> 01:55:01,188
让开
Stand clear.

1007
01:55:01,262 --> 01:55:03,025
开炮
Fire!

1008
01:55:03,932 --> 01:55:06,332
拿武器攻过去
Arm yourselves. We must board them.

1009
01:55:07,702 --> 01:55:09,795
跟我来
Follow me.

1010
01:55:25,220 --> 01:55:26,983
上啊
Now.

1011
01:55:31,659 --> 01:55:35,789
捕鲸船员  跟我来  快点跟上来
Whalers, follow me. Mr Hogg, down below. Quickly now.

1012
01:55:38,233 --> 01:55:42,033
信天翁号船员  听到吗?
Albatrosses. Albatrosses, do you hear me?

1013
01:55:43,004 --> 01:55:45,029
快阻止他们
To the guns.

1014
01:55:48,643 --> 01:55:50,975
把火药浇熄
Boyle, douse that gun's priming.

1015
01:56:26,181 --> 01:56:29,173
快点  快走
Lively there. Come on. Move.

1016
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:35,382
英勇杀敌吧
Now do your worst.

1017
01:57:06,754 --> 01:57:08,722
霍华德
-Mr Howard. -Sir.

1018
01:57:08,790 --> 01:57:11,418
-他们降旗了吗?  -降了
-Have they struck their colors? -I believe so.

1019
01:57:11,492 --> 01:57:15,155
-找到船长了吗?  -还没有
-Has their captain been sighted? -Not yet, sir.

1020
01:57:15,263 --> 01:57:17,254
继续吧
-Carry on. -Aye, sir.

1021

我是狄医生
Docteur de Vigny, monsieur.

1022
01:58:21,629 --> 01:58:24,393
我已经尽力了
I did what I could for him.

1023
01:58:29,504 --> 01:58:33,634
船长死前要我把这把剑交给你
Before the capitaine died, he said I was to give you this.

1024
02:00:03,631 --> 02:00:06,600
不  让我来
No. I'll do it.

1025
02:00:20,314 --> 02:00:22,748
请你帮忙
Can you help me?

1026

我们在天上的父
Our Father,

1027
02:00:48,509 --> 02:00:52,536
愿人都尊你的名为圣
who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.

1028
02:00:52,647 --> 02:00:56,515
愿你的国降临  愿你的旨意行在地上
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,

赐给我们日用的饮食
Give us this day our daily bread,

1031
02:01:02,490 --> 02:01:07,393
免我们的债  如同我们免了人的债
and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.

1032
02:01:07,495 --> 02:01:11,556
不叫我们遇见试探  救我们脱离凶恶
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

1033
02:01:11,666 --> 02:01:13,634
因为国度
For thine is the kingdom,

1034
02:01:13,701 --> 02:01:15,726
权柄  荣耀
the power and the glory,

1035
02:01:15,837 --> 02:01:17,896
全是你的  直到永远
forever and ever.

1036
02:01:18,005 --> 02:01:19,529

lieutenant.

1046
02:02:07,955 --> 02:02:11,220
我们将他们的遗体抛入大海
We therefore commit their bodies to the deep,

1047
02:02:11,292 --> 02:02:13,453
让他们腐朽
to be turned into corruption,

1048
02:02:13,561 --> 02:02:17,395
等待大海让他们死而复生
looking for the resurrection of the body when the sea shall give up her dead,

1049
02:02:17,465 --> 02:02:20,366
在天国得到永生
and the life of the world to come,

1050
02:02:20,434 --> 02:02:23,767
以主耶稣基督之名
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

1051
02:02:23,871 --> 02:02:25,930
阿门
Amen.

1052
02:02:54,802 --> 02:02:57,100
我们的老朋友
It's our old friend.

1053
02:03:51,492 --> 02:03:54,484
把油漆传过来
Pass down a barrel of paint, please.

1054
02:04:01,002 --> 02:04:05,166
捕鲸船员和陆战队员都上船了
Sir, the whalers are all aboard and that's the last detachment of marines.

1055
02:04:05,239 --> 02:04:06,866
很好
Good.

1056
02:04:06,974 --> 02:04:09,738
我要回加拉巴哥岛

1057
02:04:09,844 --> 02:04:13,575
补充粮水  让医生找他的鸟
Take on food and water and give the doctor a few days to find his bird.

1058
02:04:13,681 --> 02:04:14,875
好的
Very good, sir.

1059
02:04:14,982 --> 02:04:18,418
你要带地狱号到瓦尔帕莱索港
You, however, shall take the Acheron south to Valparaiso.

1060
02:04:18,519 --> 02:04:23,718
卸下人犯后到朴茨茅斯会合
Parole the prisoners there, refit as necessary, and we shall rendezvous in Portsmouth.

1061
02:04:23,824 --> 02:04:26,850
霍格将会是很好的领航员
I believe Mr Hogg would be a good choice for sailing master.

1062
02:04:26,927 --> 02:04:31,694
我让你自己决定  普灵船长
However, that will be your decision, Captain Pullings.

1063
02:04:36,604 --> 02:04:38,697
这是你的指令
Your orders.

1064
02:04:42,510 --> 02:04:45,240
-谢谢你  -祝你一帆风顺

-Good luck, sir. -Good luck, Captain.

1070
02:05:28,789 --> 02:05:30,723
他们又来了
Here we go again.

1071
02:05:30,791 --> 02:05:33,259
基里克  好了吗
Killick. Killick there.

1072
02:05:33,327 --> 02:05:36,125
好了我就会叫你
Which it will be ready when it's ready.

1073
02:05:41,669 --> 02:05:44,604
等他们靠岸我才放心
I'll rest easier when I know they've reached shore.

1074
02:05:44,672 --> 02:05:49,974
这么多伤患  只有可怜的希根照顾
So many wounded, and only that poor unfortunate Higgins to tend to them.

1075
02:05:50,077 --> 02:05:53,740
不过总比没医生来得好
Still, he's better than no doctor at all.

-我要见莫维  -莫维请到船长室
-Pass the word for Mr Mowett. -Mr Mowett to the great cabin.

1079
02:06:16,670 --> 02:06:19,696
这是他们的 "医生" 给我的
Their "doctor" gave me this sword.

1080
02:06:21,976 --> 02:06:25,002
改变航向  东南偏东
Mr Mowett, change of course. Southeast by east.

1081
02:06:25,112 --> 02:06:28,604

We'll intercept the Acheron and escort them into Valparaiso.

1082

1085
02:06:43,230 --> 02:06:46,688
你必须完成任务对吧
Subject to the requirements of the service.

1086
02:06:54,141 --> 02:06:57,474
史蒂芬  那只鸟不会飞吧?
Well, Stephen, the bird's flightless?

1087
02:06:57,545 --> 02:06:58,637
没错
Yes.

1088
02:06:59,713 --> 02:07:02,375
它哪儿也不会去的
It's not going anywhere.
