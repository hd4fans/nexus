1
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:12,066
Beware, the balance. Bassoon. Softer...

2
00:03:23,035 --> 00:03:24,745
- Hello.
- Teddy, it's me.

3
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,665
Love, I've told you
not to call me here!

4
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:32,211
This is urgent, I need twenty
people for tomorrow.

5
00:03:32,336 --> 00:03:37,633
Twenty people canceled, because of the funeral
of a supermarket owner.

6
00:03:37,758 --> 00:03:40,386
- They pay them better there.
- Filipov!

7
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:45,099
- I am sorry. You got the wrong number.
- Andrei semionovitch filipov!

8
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:50,104
You are banned from the reharsal.
You clean here!

9
00:03:50,354 --> 00:03:54,817
I am sorry, Leonid Dmitrievitch.
But you promised...

10
00:03:54,942 --> 00:03:59,822
No, no. Don't start again, please.
You will lead again in due course.

11
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:04,285
Not a word about "your orchestra"!
Please follow me.

12
00:04:06,954 --> 00:04:10,041
This is all the respect you have
for the Great Bolshoi?

13
00:04:10,082 --> 00:04:11,959
How can I trust you?

14
00:04:12,084 --> 00:04:15,338
We will speak about your orchestra
when everything is clean.

15
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,758
- It will be clean
- Before tomorrow morning!

16
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:46,744
Theater Chatelet, Paris....

17
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,880
Official invitation....

18
00:04:58,714 --> 00:05:02,134
Deleted. Vanished.
Never arrived.

19
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:05,638
Go ahead Goliath!
Go hire Bill Gates to find it back now!

20
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:10,601
I need the contract for Genkin's wedding.
A thousand guests

21
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:13,062
- Genkin is in the mafia.
- They are all in the mafia!

22
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:18,025
They dress up better, they send their
sons to study in London...

23
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:21,696
What's the difference? He wants
a party with a 1000 people, you understand?

24
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,115
He probably knows only 200 people
at most...

25
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:27,368
that means, Teddy,
that we will find him 800 people.

26
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,747
we can earn enough to buy
a pot of land,

27
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,791
to grow our vegetables.

28
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,461
We will never have to buy
overpriced veggies again.

29
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:40,673
My pension went up 100 rubli,
my rent went up 300.

30
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:45,178
30 rubli for a kg of potatoes
how can we keep going like this?

31
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:48,431
- We might sell the piano.
- Never.

32
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:53,144
That stupid Genkin wants to have
more guest than Makarov.

33
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:56,772
- To show off he's got bigger balls
- Irina!

34
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:01,194
You will help me, Teddy, right?
You will find some people?

35
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,572
- Irina?
- Hi, Sacha, any news?

36
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:08,242
- I have called my friend. Everything settled.
- You are an angel, you saved my life.

37
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,244
- Four more.
- That makes only 18.

38
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:14,207
- We need 19 at least.
- Well, worst case I can go.

39
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,627
- Ok. See you later than.
- Later.

40
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:28,763
Teddy... I understand.
I know you are tired, but...

41
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:32,308
I still need another
person.

42
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,397
Coming.
I go and get changed.

43
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,331
- Home for all!
- A job for all!

44
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:02,880
The nation! The people
is on our side!

45
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:06,634
History is on our side!

46
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,722
We will built together
a better society!

47
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:15,101
Long live communism!

48
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:20,648
- Long live!

49
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,275
- Don't run away, we have to talk.
- What?

50
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:25,945
Together towards the
great revolution!

51
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:29,365
Everyday the government
makes new pledges

52
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:33,828
Twenty eight, twenty nine and thirty.
You have asked me 30 and I brought them to you.

53
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:37,206
And now you have to pay
me for thirty.

54
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,586
Can we average out?
500 rubli per person.

55
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,713
Plus a hundred each as a bonus

56
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,424
If so, you will all come back
next Sunday as well

57
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,843
600 rubli for two Sundays.
What do you think?

58
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:52,638
Gavrilov, forget about it.
Every Sunday is the same story.

59
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:56,309
Our tariff is 400 rubli each person
for each day of protest

60
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,729
- Don't you have faith anymore, Irina?
- You can all go to hell for what I care...

61
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:05,484
Give me my money, 12,000
Not a ruble short, clear?

62
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:09,363
- This is extorsionate.
- Come on, come on.

63
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,907
- Extorsion, really.
- Of course.

64
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:15,161
Moscow Union of Musicians

65
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:44,106
Come on, Andrei. Just a gulp.
you are not going to die

66
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,235
Come on

67
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:52,114
You are still our director
You are our leader, aren't you?

68
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:03,084
- Have you heard that? He said no!
- Come with me.

69
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,467
Read.

70
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:16,722
Attention Mr. Leonid
Vinitchenko, director of Bolshoi.

71
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:21,435
Dear Mr Vinitchenko, I have learned
from your website that your orchestra

72
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,022
could be available for a concert
in fifteen days,

73
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:28,317
on Saturday June 13th.
Los Angeles Philarmonic

74
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:32,446
was supposed to tour in France
but they canceled at last minute

75
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:36,325
We would be delighted to have you
in our theater to replace them

76
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,871
in order to offer our audience
an unforgettable night

77
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:43,791
This is an official invitation
I will arrange a telephic appointment

78
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,170
to clarify details day after tomorrow
at 4pm, Moscow time.

79
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:51,757
My sincere best... Olivier... Morne...

80
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,385
Duplessis, director
of Chatelet Theater.

81
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,804
It's written in Russian
It's a joke

82
00:09:56,888 --> 00:10:02,185
It's signed. Stamped. There is a French
address. Chatelet Theater.

83
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,773
- So what?
- We are going, instead of the Bolshoi.

84
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:11,068
Paris, Sacha! Chatelet Theater,
our life dream!

85
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:14,405
Bolshoi Orchestra in Paris.
At the Chatelet!

86
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:18,701
Are you insane? Do you want to prentend
we are the Bolshoi?

87
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,454
They are terrible. We are better.

88
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,796
Hide this away, before we
are all going to jail

89
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,469
Teddy, are you there?

90
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:44,769
- Yeah, we are here.
- Andrei, are you alright?

91
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,731
- Open the door
- He's well, don't worry.

92
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:55,655
- We are chatting, love.
- You scared me. Such kids.

93
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,995
We have not played for 30 years,
we are a bunch of failures.

94
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,414
- How can you put up a full orchestra?
- Turn right

95
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:09,502
No money, not an organization

96
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,629
how can we be a real orchestra?

97
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:15,341
fifteen days to find 80 musicians.
you are out of your mind

98
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,302
- why don't we also provide a ballet too?
- Keep on right

99
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:24,141
We only need 55 musicians

100
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,895
Stop here. Here we are.

101
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,814
Communist Party. Directorate

102
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:35,236
Tomorrow the Chatelet will make
a call to Leonid

103
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:38,072
- and it's all over
- No. We will call them first

104
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:42,076
What is this?
Communist Party? Are you crazy?

105
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:46,873
Gavrilov, the KGB!. You are totally
burned. What are we doing here?

106
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:52,086
Ivan was the best impresario in Moscow.
And he speaks French better than Moliere

107
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,380
- Of course, Moliere is dead!
- He is the man we need.

108
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:58,467
- He is the man who ruined us.
- He has only obeyed orders.

109
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:02,972
He stormed on stage during
the Caikovsky violin concerto

110
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,850
and he interrupted it to humiliate
you in front of your audience!

111
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:09,854
He is the devil! He had an orgasm,
watching you go down!

112
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:14,817
I am not going in. You can't escape alive
twice from a communist dictatorship

113
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,027
you should know

114
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:20,072
Wouldn't you like to play
the cello again?

115
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:23,284
Or would you prefer to drive an
ambulance for the rest of your life?

116
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:28,623
Ivan gavrilov owes us a concerto.
Owes us "The Concerto"!

117
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,253
Are you still able to be
an Orchestra Impresario?

118
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,923
Which orchestra? You should greet first
Which orchestra?

119
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,842
Good morning. Bolshoi Orchestra.
But not exactly the Bolshoi

120
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:43,846
- Is the Bolshoi or not? Be clear!
- Yes and no. Both and either.

121
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:47,558
We need an impresario
for a concerto abroad.

122
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:51,854
- We? Who is "we"?
- We! You ruined us thirty years ago!

123
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,440
The orchestra you shoved in the
toilet thirty years ago!

124
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,276
All the tour abroad you stopped us from
doing, you piece of shit!

125
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:01,864
Such an idiot! Thirty years ago
you would have asked asylum anywhere

126
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:07,411
Even in Patagonia! You would have
immediately betrayed our beloved motherland

127
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:12,375
You would have talked with the imperialists.
You would have spit on your own land.

128
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:16,128
The land that nourished you
I had my information at the time

129
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:20,341
What fucking motherland are you
talking about, you wanker!

130
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:23,928
You ruined us all. You humiliated us,
you have crashed us!

131
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:27,932
You stripped us bare,
sent us on the street like dogs

132
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,977
You bastard, son of a bitch!

133
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,230
Fucking idiot!
Stupid ambulance driver

134
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,524
It's only your fault if I drive
the ambulance

135
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,943
It's your fault my family
has left me

136
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:43,906
You only have to blame yourself.
You could have gone to Israel with them

137
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,410
- I have my information
- This is my country!

138
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:51,998
- Driver for the dead!
- Stop it, stop now!

139
00:13:55,126 --> 00:14:00,006
We came to talk about Paris.
A concerto at the Chatelet Theater

140
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,676
- The need confirmation by tomorrow
- Who? What Paris?

141
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:06,679
It's for the Bolshoi

142
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:10,308
But they play like amateurs now
they are not good enough for this

143
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:13,728
can you imagine the French press?
this would destroy them

144
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,105
- Did you say Paris?
- They would write something like...

145
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:20,526
"Russian Orchestras are not as they
used to be, they are only a memory"

146
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:25,740
- How can we Russians stand this?
- Paris. Why do you need me?

147
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,743
You can help us negotiate, as
the good old times.

148
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:33,289
You were the best impresario
the Bolshoi has ever had

149
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:39,629
Paris. Ok, I am in.

150
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:45,718
Why? What is your goal with this?
What are you hiding? Speak clear.

151
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,470
- What do you want to help us?
- I want nothing.

152
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,514
- You are cheating us.
- Nothing? Really?

153
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,015
Not a ruble

154
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:56,479
A comrade pass for the metro,
buses, railways...

155
00:14:56,562 --> 00:15:00,858
don't need that, I have one already
I am interested. I am in.

156
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,277
You have my word.

157
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:07,990
Did you see his smile? You can't trust
that snake! he will cheat us

158
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:10,201
let's give us. give the fax back.

159
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:14,163
I have seen the fire in his eyes.
He wants to try it.

160
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,643
Paris.

161
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:57,957
- How many seats in the Chatelet?
- Dont know. Maybe 1500.

162
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:00,918
Two thousand maybe.

163
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:11,387
I have found it on the internet.

164
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,932
Two thousand, I think.

165
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:22,106
Andrei, I will ask for divorce

166
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:27,528
if you are not going to Paris

167
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:33,326
Show me you are still the Maestro
and you can direct this concerto.

168
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:40,666
I have been waiting thirty years
Thirty years

169
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,311
Concerto.

170
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,876
Enemy of the people!

171
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,753
Down the curtains!

172
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:20,451
- Does this telephone work?
- I always use it to call Israel.

173
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,453
It works perfectly

174
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:24,997
And you don't pay for it?
You steal your call from the People?

175
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,542
Telephone belongs to the country,
you steal from the community

176
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,753
- What do you want me to use, smoke signals?
- Shut up! We are on.

177
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,588
Shithead.

178
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,092
- Hello?
- Good morning my dear lady.

179
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,011
My best wishes.
How is your health today?

180
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:42,181
This is the illustrious comrade
Ivan Gavrilov speaking.

181
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:45,101
Director of the Bolshoi.

182
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,937
I would be joyful to be merrily
entertained with Mr. Duplessis.

183
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:50,106
Could you gracefully have him
introduced to me?

184
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,567
What? Just a minute.
I'll check if he's in the office.

185
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:56,404
A minute?
I call from Moscow! A minute...

186
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,365
Ah, Mr. Gavrilov, what a pleasure!
how are you?

187
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:03,536
Enormously well, my dear friend!

188
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,622
If I knew that it was you again
to run the Bolshoi, I would have

189
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,291
sent you that fax directly

190
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:11,669
Do not forgive yourself, please.
It's unforgivable.

191
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:17,008
Mr Duplessis, I am not calling you
from my office now. We have...

192
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:20,511
some problems with
the post office

193
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:24,599
- Don't shout, I can hear you well.
- I beg your pardon.

194
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:29,312
It is a necessity that me being the
one to bell you, it's safer this way

195
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,521
Alright.

196
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:34,275
I would like to confide in you
my walking telephone number

197
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,278
- Of course.
- Can you inscribe it?

198
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,488
Sure, I am listening

199
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:46,037
- Zero, zero. Seven. Nine ten.
- Ok.

200
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,873
fortysix. eighteen.
eight thirty.

201
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:53,836
Very well. Do you think
you can make the concerto?

202
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:59,800
Depends on the conditions. We would have to
deny a very lucrative concerto...

203
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,845
On your site I have read that
you are totally available

204
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,389
It's a private concerto.
Very very private.

205
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:08,017
For the gas king in Eastern
Russia, you see...

206
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,645
It's his concubine birthday...

207
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:13,981
As you name it.
A descreet and intime concerto

208
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:16,025
But the orchestra is all invited

209
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:21,614
I will send you today a protocal
to screw you our conditions

210
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:27,703
And if it charms you, we can
rapidly pose our seal

211
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:32,291
Hurry up, we only have two weeks.
What about the program?

212
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,252
- The program?
- Yes.

213
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:39,257
Naturally, the program...
Idiots, what's the program?

214
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:41,801
Cajkovskij.

215
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:48,015
Hello, Ivan?
Ivan, are you there? Hello?

216
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,310
We will play Cajkovskij.

217
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:54,021
- Concerto for violin and orchestra.
- I can't hear you anymore.

218
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:57,859
- Oh, no. We start again.
- Excuse me. Did you say Cajkovskij?

219
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:02,864
Cajkovskij.
Concerto for violin and orchestra.

220
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:07,869
Can't hear you. Hello?
Ivan! I will wait for your proposal.

221
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:15,585
- Well done, you cheated me. Are you happy now?
- And you? Thirty years ago?

222
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:20,715
- What about it?
- Great job. You are still the best.

223
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:30,183
I know. Negotiation is like going on a
bicicle. If you learn, you don't forget.

224
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:33,644
What did they say?
Do they agree?

225
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:35,938
We have them by the balls!

226
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,984
Two thousand dollars per head,
I doubled the tariff.

227
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,278
No, it's a wedding.
Bring the whole family

228
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,865
- Plus 30 euros per day for the expenses
- 350 rubli.

229
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:48,701
- And of course: free dinner.
- Andrei: four thousand dollars.

230
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:52,371
The program.
Cajkovskij concerto. What after?

231
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:56,083
- What do you mean after?
- It's too short

232
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:58,878
Sacha will bring you all back
home on the ambulance

233
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:02,381
Cajkovskij serenade and
Prokofiev, concerto n.1

234
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:06,719
Perfect. Tickets and insurance
will be paid by Paris

235
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,474
Once it was the government to pay
for these expenses, but now it's no more

236
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:14,727
Trip planning
Day one: arrival in Paris

237
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:20,107
Outing and rich dinner in the
famous restaurant "le trou normand".

238
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:23,152
Day two:
orchestra reharsal

239
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:28,449
And a must: in the evening
boat trip on the Sein

240
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:33,037
Day three: concerto.
Approved, gentlemen? Approved?

241
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:35,998
- Of course.
- All clear?

242
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:42,088
I have got the wedding, thousand guests!
We will have our home grown veggies!

243
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:44,173
- Irina, sugar please.
- Be right back.

244
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:46,592
I'll give you a hand

245
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:49,178
I reckon there will be a hotel
close to the theathre, right?

246
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:51,973
- He wants to play Cajkovskij!
- I know. And you will help him too

247
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:55,393
- Me?
- Yes, you. Come on, come on, come on!

248
00:23:57,019 --> 00:24:00,690
I will demand to have the
Hotel Paris Lumiere.

249
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:05,027
Champs - elysees, it's the best
incredibly luxurious

250
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:08,322
let's get to the important stuff

251
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:10,449
Who's going to do the violin solo?

252
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:16,122
The only violin I want is
Anne marie Jacquet.

253
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:21,669
- You are kidding, right? She is a star.
- Exactly, that is what we need!

254
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:27,758
Are we not stars ourselves?
We won't play without Jacquet.

255
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,137
Are we not asking a bit too much?

256
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:36,142
We need to be demanding.
Capricious. That will make us strong.

257
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:38,561
And professional.

258
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:40,938
Are these net or gross amounts?

259
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:43,691
They look like pay from
before the Perestroika

260
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:47,778
It must be for your friendship with
Gavrilov. He is doing you a favour.

261
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:52,575
- Unless it is a trap.
- We need them, Mr. Duplessis.

262
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,994
We have promised to correct the
situation with a concerto

263
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:58,080
both prestigious and proficuous:
Los Angeles Philarmonic

264
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:01,417
Without Los Angeles we have a debt
of 1,2 million Euros

265
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:04,420
- Not the 500 thousand we declared
- Don't blast my balls with numbers!

266
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:10,051
- What else do they want?
- Three days in Paris.

267
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:13,596
Plus some weird request...
bateau-mouche... and le trou normand.

268
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:14,972
- Do you know that restaurant?
- No.

269
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:18,518
Fuck them! I will tell them no.
You take them on the bateau-mouche!

270
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:22,230
- They are still very cheap!
- Three days, the Sein, the restaurant...

271
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:26,025
This let them feel more professional.
The slavic soul.

272
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:28,653
- What about Anne marie Jacquet?
- What's her cost?

273
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:32,031
Very high. But her cost, plus
her agent, plus tax, insurance,

274
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:36,369
the orchestra, their weird requests, it's
still cheaper than the Los Angeles

275
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:39,372
Fifty per cent margin.
If we refuse Anne marie Jacquet,

276
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:40,373
We raise to 75.

277
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:42,542
Without Anne marie Jacquet,
no Bolshoi, no concerto.

278
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:46,087
If she is not there, they won't come.
Bertrand, you still don't get it!

279
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:48,172
Call her agent.

280
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:51,551
No, I understand very well, Olivier,
but I can't do anything about it.

281
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:57,098
I am very sorry. Yes, I am sorry
too. Good luck, good bye.

282
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:05,106
- 45 minutes and we have to go.
- Who was it?

283
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:08,276
Nobody. An interview for a
brazilian magazine

284
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:09,986
Why you are not married,
things like that.

285
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:12,572
And they asked you why I
don't play Cajkovskij?

286
00:26:12,697 --> 00:26:16,200
- Cajkovskij? No!
- I've heard you saying...

287
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:21,831
- She does not play Cajkovskij
- Yes, it's true, they have asked me

288
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:28,588
- what are you doing?
- I call back the last dialled number.

289
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:32,633
Duplessis. Chatelet Theater,
Cajkovskij concerto.

290
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:36,554
In two weeks. Go figure.
Just between Madrid and Chicago

291
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:39,473
So late in time. And what manners!

292
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:44,478
- Which orchestra?
- The Bolshoi.

293
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:47,440
What? You said no to the Bolshoi?

294
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:50,359
Darling, you have never played
Cajkovskij and this happens between

295
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:52,195
Madrid and Chicago, it's unfeasible.

296
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:57,033
Wholewheat bread was not fresh,
I didn't take it. The honey arrives tomorrow.

297
00:26:57,158 --> 00:27:00,328
Guylene, are you joking?

298
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:03,498
I have always dreaded to
perform Cajkovskij, it's true.

299
00:27:03,623 --> 00:27:09,879
But I dream the Cajkovskij
with the Bolshoi. And you know it, Guylene.

300
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:14,842
The Bolshoi is not anymore what it was
It's too big of a risk

301
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:19,764
- what's the name of the director?
- I can't remember, I think it was...

302
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:22,892
Andrei Filipov Marazov,
something like that...

303
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:29,815
Yes. It is him. Rings a bell?

304
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:35,738
Are you kidding? Rings a bell?
The maestro, Guylene. The maestro!

305
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:39,659
A living legend. Cajkovskij
with him? And you are still thinking?

306
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:42,453
He has not directed for thirty years.

307
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:46,916
Call Duplessis.
I will do it, no matter what

308
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:50,002
Clear?

309
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:57,802
My friend. She is very tired
I will try my best, but I am afraid....

310
00:27:57,885 --> 00:28:02,765
- There is Madrid first, then Chicago...
- Guylene, how much?

311
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:07,747
By God! Rivka, come and
see who's here!

312
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,583
Here is the man who sent
Breznev to fuck himself!

313
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:14,128
- How are your lips?
- How is the ashma?

314
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:16,130
He does not want to get better,
he coughs like a donkey

315
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:19,175
I play much better when
I cough. Make yourself at ease

316
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,947
Are there still sinagogues in Paris?
They get along with us jewish?

317
00:29:41,072 --> 00:29:44,408
There are more sinagogues than churches,
one in every corner

318
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:47,745
Churches are almost all gone,
christian French are all laic

319
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,914
Really? What about Notre Dame?

320
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:53,668
Haven't you watched on tv?
The funeral of cardinal whathisname?

321
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:56,379
They recited the kaddish
in front of Notre Dame.

322
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:58,506
Nowadays it's jewish outside
and catholic inside

323
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:03,719
Half and half
Will you come with us, Viktor?

324
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:10,101
- I'd do it for you, Andrei.
- You are great for us.

325
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:12,937
And Moses should come too.
Our son

326
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:16,941
It's the Louis Armstrong of the Simphonic
even better than his dad

327
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:19,360
- God bless you.
- Amen.

328
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:50,683
- Andrei!
- Sacha! My friend!

329
00:31:19,587 --> 00:31:22,673
- Andrei! Sacha!
- How are you?

330
00:31:31,766 --> 00:31:35,269
Go away, Andrei.
You are a disgrace! Get lost!

331
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:46,739
Watch out! Slow down!

332
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:57,750
The Violin!

333
00:31:59,544 --> 00:32:01,671
You move when I call you!

334
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:04,317
- You know when they arrive?
- In a week. As usual.

335
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:06,194
Yes, right.

336
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:10,573
Shall we get moving?

337
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:14,160
It's in three days. We don't have
percussions nor double bass

338
00:33:14,243 --> 00:33:16,204
I can do double bass with my mouth
let's get going

339
00:33:16,287 --> 00:33:20,041
it's madness, we will never get to a
real orchestra

340
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:24,086
- Listen, we will go to Paris
- Going is not enough!

341
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:28,549
- The problem is not to get to Paris!
- Sure, problem is Cajkovskij!

342
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:33,596
It's been thirty years. I shouldn't
have put up this chaos

343
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:37,767
You have it in your blood! You remember,
right? You got us drunk with that concerto,

344
00:33:37,892 --> 00:33:40,269
it was an obsession, a part of your body

345
00:33:40,353 --> 00:33:43,940
How many times did you direct
in your head during these thirty years?

346
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:50,905
I and Irina are tired! Will you free
once and for all that poor Cajkovskij?

347
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:56,911
- You were against the idea!
- Absolutely not. I adore Paris

348
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:17,265
Congratulations!

349
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:33,573
Thanks a lot. Follow her,
she will bring you to your table

350
00:34:37,702 --> 00:34:38,786
Please

351
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:47,628
Anybody wants to come to Paris?
A concerto at Chatelet theatre.

352
00:34:47,712 --> 00:34:51,757
- Cajkovskij, the Violin concerto.
- No thanks.

353
00:34:51,883 --> 00:34:55,136
What's wrong with you, Andrei?
You got drunk again?

354
00:35:00,975 --> 00:35:04,478
We got guests. Makarov.

355
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:21,787
Honestly, he looks a bit pissed off.

356
00:35:21,913 --> 00:35:25,249
I am sure of it. Only five hundred
people at his wedding

357
00:35:25,374 --> 00:35:32,048
To my table! Up their arse, my
in-laws! Applause!

358
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:34,967
- Good evening.
- Have you been invited? This is a private party.

359
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:39,889
Paris does not want to pay in advance
for plane tickets, they will reimburse us
when we get there.

360
00:35:40,014 --> 00:35:42,225
- Why?
- Times have changed.

361
00:35:42,308 --> 00:35:46,771
All travel expenses must be paid in advance.
Give me a drink.

362
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:50,900
This is only one of your bloody tricks to
sabotage our concerto.

363
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:53,611
- You have to find a solution
- What do you expect me to find?

364
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:57,365
- A sponsor. It's the only solution
- Go for a round between those big cars.

365
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:58,741
An oligarch.

366
00:35:58,825 --> 00:36:03,037
They all prefer to put money in football
they don't give a shit about music

367
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,831
And definitely not this kind of
borgeous music.

368
00:36:04,956 --> 00:36:08,209
Don't even try it, Gavrilov.

369
00:36:08,334 --> 00:36:12,630
30 years have done since your circus
number during my husband concerto.

370
00:36:12,713 --> 00:36:15,800
You digged him into alchool, you
ruined his life.

371
00:36:15,925 --> 00:36:18,678
Even when we lost the best friends
we have ever had

372
00:36:18,803 --> 00:36:21,347
I never said a thing and I know
I was wrong about it

373
00:36:21,472 --> 00:36:25,935
Now you don't say one more word
about his music or I will chop your balls off.

374
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:30,314
Excuse me now, I need to finish.

375
00:36:30,398 --> 00:36:35,444
Find him a sponsor
And a flight to take them all to Paris.

376
00:36:35,903 --> 00:36:40,783
And if something goes wrong, don't come back.
You better ask for asylum,

377
00:36:40,908 --> 00:36:43,995
I can assure you that your
Sunday committee

378
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,623
would become quickly sad monologues
to a desert square

379
00:36:47,707 --> 00:36:51,294
You would not find anybody to bring
you even the worst people for a walk-on.

380
00:36:51,419 --> 00:36:53,880
Trust me, nobody! Is that clear?

381
00:36:57,091 --> 00:37:01,095
This time I am ready to
choke you with my own hands

382
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,264
if you hurt my Teddy

383
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:12,398
Bravo!

384
00:37:12,523 --> 00:37:16,194
Shhh! Silent!

385
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:21,282
It's now the moment, ladies and gents,
my dear dear guests,

386
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:25,703
dear lord minister
dear lords of the Duma

387
00:37:25,786 --> 00:37:28,873
it's now the moment to introduce
to you the Gas Zar

388
00:37:28,998 --> 00:37:34,670
the Cobalt King, who represents
the best part of our beloved Russia

389
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:41,385
A great friend of mine, who is also
the most talented viol... cellist

390
00:37:41,511 --> 00:37:44,680
of the planet! Piotr Tretiakin!

391
00:37:44,764 --> 00:37:49,477
- Applause! Stronger Applause!
- Bravo! Bravo!

392
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:52,230
Bravo!

393
00:37:52,355 --> 00:37:54,065
Go for it, Piotr!

394
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:05,743
- Oh, yes! Bravo! Yes!
- Bravo! You are great!

395
00:38:05,827 --> 00:38:09,956
- Bravo!
- Altogether go! Go, go!

396
00:38:10,623 --> 00:38:13,543
Go, go, go. Together!

397
00:38:14,001 --> 00:38:17,255
Great, great, great Piotr!
The best of the world!

398
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:20,675
I think it is much better to have
ashma than to be deaf

399
00:38:20,758 --> 00:38:22,635
Shut up, that's enough.

400
00:38:29,433 --> 00:38:35,857
Hello. Oh oh, Duplessis?
Ivan gavrilov. Yes, yes, yes!

401
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,703
I don't care. No
Trou Normand, no concerto.

402
00:38:48,786 --> 00:38:53,082
I need the Trou... Normand!

403
00:39:07,722 --> 00:39:10,516
He has hanged up on me.
He wants the Trou Normand.

404
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:15,563
No, it's not my fault. I can't find
this Trou Normand. Not where he says it is.

405
00:39:16,439 --> 00:39:21,486
We have even Anne Marie Jacquet.
She is alright, but...

406
00:39:25,156 --> 00:39:30,786
where he says it should be, there is a different
restaurant. We will change it for a night!

407
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:36,209
Tell him we accept all clauses.
Just sign the bloody contract.

408
00:39:36,292 --> 00:39:39,378
It's only a week away, start with the
press campaign

409
00:39:39,462 --> 00:39:40,463
and call france television.

410
00:39:47,637 --> 00:39:50,556
Andrei filipov e
Anne Marie Jacquet. Grand!

411
00:39:53,142 --> 00:39:56,229
Die you son of a bitch!

412
00:40:19,293 --> 00:40:22,004
Wait, wait, don't shoot I beg you!

413
00:40:22,088 --> 00:40:23,965
Mr Tretiakin!

414
00:40:24,715 --> 00:40:27,635
You play gorgeously!

415
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:34,684
I am Ivan Gavrilov.
You must have heard about me, right?

416
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:37,353
I heard you all right, you were
talking on the phone!

417
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:40,898
Sorry, this is a misunderstanding
I truly appreciate your musical talent!

418
00:40:40,982 --> 00:40:43,609
I am the director of the Bolshoi
We need to go to Paris

419
00:40:43,693 --> 00:40:46,946
to do a concerto
in the prestigious Chatelet Theatre.

420
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:50,032
You are a refined art lover,
would you care to sponsor us?

421
00:40:50,158 --> 00:40:52,285
- You really are the Bolshoi director?
- Yes!

422
00:40:52,368 --> 00:40:54,078
- And you will play in Paris?
- Yes!

423
00:40:54,203 --> 00:40:57,874
- At the Chatelet?
- Yes, Chatelet Theathre!

424
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:10,052
Cheers, gentlemen. It's a pleasure. See
mommy? The lessons were useful.

425
00:41:10,178 --> 00:41:16,100
Stupid toad. You were supposed to buy a team!
Paris Saint Germain.

426
00:41:16,184 --> 00:41:21,856
That one is cheap. Then you buy
Messi and let him play ahead.

427
00:41:21,981 --> 00:41:27,570
My sincere thanks, Mr Tretiakin.
We will keep in contact

428
00:41:27,695 --> 00:41:31,365
- Mother, my regards.
- I will walk you down.

429
00:41:37,246 --> 00:41:39,207
No, no, no. I am the one to thank you.

430
00:41:39,332 --> 00:41:41,542
My driver will come pick up
the score.

431
00:41:41,626 --> 00:41:45,546
I am honored to play in your orchestra
and believe me, I am ready

432
00:41:45,671 --> 00:41:49,592
Business is not important, it's just
a hobby for me. But music...

433
00:41:49,717 --> 00:41:52,178
Music is all my life!

434
00:41:52,261 --> 00:41:54,639
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

435
00:41:56,098 --> 00:41:58,643
Spasibo bolchoi. Spasibo.

436
00:42:06,484 --> 00:42:09,654
I am a musician, not a
beat-boxer!

437
00:42:09,737 --> 00:42:12,907
Come back, fast!
We need to take back the cheque right away!

438
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:14,951
The whole Europe will
laugh at us!

439
00:42:15,034 --> 00:42:17,411
can you please calm down, Andrei?
we now have the orchestra.

440
00:42:17,495 --> 00:42:20,289
we have Anne Marie Jacquet,
we have the plane tickets

441
00:42:20,373 --> 00:42:24,126
And a cellist that is a
music serial killer!

442
00:42:24,252 --> 00:42:25,336
What did you say?

443
00:42:25,461 --> 00:42:29,048
I said that I need to give you
a good news and a bad news

444
00:42:29,173 --> 00:42:33,219
Bad news first. To go to France
we need a visa

445
00:42:33,302 --> 00:42:36,013
Half of the musicians don't even
have a passport

446
00:42:37,306 --> 00:42:40,393
Three weeks for a passport.
Eight days for a visa.

447
00:42:40,476 --> 00:42:43,187
Perfect!
And you tell us only now?

448
00:42:43,271 --> 00:42:46,524
And what's the good news?

449
00:42:46,649 --> 00:42:49,485
We have got the Trou Normand!

450
00:42:51,279 --> 00:42:54,532
Fiftyfive passports inclusive of
Visa. Yourself included?

451
00:42:54,657 --> 00:42:58,244
- Including Ivan is fiftysix.
- Make it sixty.

452
00:42:58,369 --> 00:43:00,997
All blank. We will put names
on at last

453
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,833
Can you do something like
that in 24 hours?

454
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:07,253
No problem. But this is an
expensive thing to do.

455
00:43:07,962 --> 00:43:10,590
How much? We are not millionaire...
The people...

456
00:43:10,673 --> 00:43:12,550
... but we can pay, we will pay

457
00:43:12,675 --> 00:43:17,054
OK, bring your passport pictures.
We will do all there at the airport

458
00:43:18,973 --> 00:43:23,603
- Vassili, we need another favour
- Anything for you, maestro

459
00:43:24,979 --> 00:43:27,690
We are a few instruments short

460
00:43:27,773 --> 00:43:30,526
A few of us had to sell them
during hard times

461
00:43:30,651 --> 00:43:34,572
as they have also sold the concerto
suit and the shoes

462
00:43:37,158 --> 00:43:43,080
It's not easy. But we can speak about this
in Paris. I have many friends there.

463
00:43:43,206 --> 00:43:46,542
It's too much of a risk to wait
till Paris

464
00:43:47,126 --> 00:43:50,963
Andrei! Do you know what
my grandma used to say?

465
00:43:51,088 --> 00:43:55,092
"Do not forgot, my dear grandson,
sun only rises at morning time".

466
00:43:55,176 --> 00:43:56,969
"never in the evening".

467
00:43:57,094 --> 00:43:59,138
was she drunk?

468
00:44:00,765 --> 00:44:03,142
You didn't get it. I'll explain it to you.

469
00:44:03,267 --> 00:44:08,898
Now it is evening. And we are here.
Tomorrow we are in Paris. And it is
morning

470
00:44:27,208 --> 00:44:31,254
Viktor, watch out for Moses
Don't sleep with the windows open.

471
00:44:31,379 --> 00:44:34,632
- Mum, I am thirty five.
- And you still did not get married!

472
00:44:34,715 --> 00:44:37,468
Even Leon the hunchback
managed to find himself a wife!

473
00:44:37,552 --> 00:44:40,805
- Shalom alekum, dear friends!
- Shalom!

474
00:44:53,818 --> 00:44:57,572
Come on, comrades. Hurry up!

475
00:44:58,281 --> 00:45:01,242
As soon as you get to your room
hang up the trousers

476
00:45:01,325 --> 00:45:04,829
those luxury hotels don't always have
the pressing iron in the room

477
00:45:04,912 --> 00:45:07,999
And ask them to shiny your shoes
I don't want you to go around as a...

478
00:45:08,082 --> 00:45:11,169
... beggar. Are you listening?

479
00:45:12,628 --> 00:45:16,048
- Where are the vans?
- Patience, patience!

480
00:45:18,634 --> 00:45:23,097
- already 45 minutes late.
- end of the adventure. happy?

481
00:45:23,431 --> 00:45:28,394
- hey, have you seen any bus at all?
- i have seen a van face

482
00:45:28,477 --> 00:45:31,397
- a van face?
- did you pay them advance?

483
00:45:31,522 --> 00:45:34,609
- of course I have paid them
- then they will never show up! Good job!

484
00:45:34,692 --> 00:45:35,776
Best impresario in Moscow!

485
00:45:35,902 --> 00:45:37,862
Let's try call some taxis.
How many do we need?

486
00:45:37,945 --> 00:45:41,991
We cannot afford them.
Don't panic, we have got plenty of time

487
00:45:42,366 --> 00:45:45,536
- Gavrilov, I am going to kill you
- Calm down, we have got many hours!

488
00:45:45,661 --> 00:45:47,205
Why did we come out so early then?

489
00:45:47,288 --> 00:45:51,918
A good impresario is cautious
and I am a pro.

490
00:45:52,001 --> 00:45:55,421
I thought we could have
a problem with the vans

491
00:46:21,906 --> 00:46:24,033
There they are!

492
00:46:25,493 --> 00:46:28,246
Comrades, one at a time!

493
00:46:28,454 --> 00:46:31,624
Stay in the line, stay in the line.
Calm down, come here.

494
00:46:32,208 --> 00:46:33,709
Thank you, thanks a lot!

495
00:46:35,586 --> 00:46:39,507
With your picture in hand
Don't push, calm down

496
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:42,844
wait for your turn
double check your data

497
00:46:42,969 --> 00:46:45,888
Come on, come on, don't jam the line
did you prepare the picture?

498
00:46:45,972 --> 00:46:49,141
- yes
- come on, come on. well?

499
00:47:01,654 --> 00:47:03,281
Come on Moses

500
00:47:03,781 --> 00:47:07,451
France Visa only?
Ten more dollars and you get Morocco as well

501
00:47:07,577 --> 00:47:10,121
- I don't know anybody in Morocco
- Get it daddy, you never know

502
00:47:10,204 --> 00:47:12,915
- I have said no.
- Laminated cover? It's an optional

503
00:47:12,999 --> 00:47:14,709
- No
- Three dollars only!

504
00:47:14,834 --> 00:47:17,503
- No, spasibo.
- Leather cover?

505
00:47:17,587 --> 00:47:19,297
- Daddy...
- no.

506
00:47:26,262 --> 00:47:29,015
Where are you going, handsome?
Shall I give you a manicure?

507
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:32,226
Or maybe I can read your luck?

508
00:47:33,436 --> 00:47:35,646
- Sorry?
- He is with us.

509
00:47:38,274 --> 00:47:42,028
Youlia, yes, I told you already

510
00:47:42,153 --> 00:47:44,280
Read me the contract.

511
00:47:46,282 --> 00:47:47,658
No, non accettable.

512
00:47:48,117 --> 00:47:52,246
- There you go, have a safe trip.
- Here you are, sir.

513
00:47:54,123 --> 00:47:55,666
Have a safe trip.

514
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:12,058
Mr Duplessis? This is Jean Paul.
Sure, all is good, plane has landed.

515
00:48:26,614 --> 00:48:29,367
Good morning, Mr. Filipov.
Welcome to Paris.

516
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:31,410
What a honor. Ah, Mrs Filipov...

517
00:48:31,536 --> 00:48:35,373
I forgive you very much, Sir Duplessis.
This is not Sir Filipov.

518
00:48:35,456 --> 00:48:38,876
- And I am not Mr. Duplessis.
- Charmed, I take a bow.

519
00:48:39,001 --> 00:48:42,755
This Sir names himself Sir Tretiakin.
Here lies Andrei Filipov.

520
00:48:44,674 --> 00:48:47,218
I am not Olivier Duplessis,
My name is Jean Paul Carrere.

521
00:48:47,343 --> 00:48:51,180
- Duplessis sends you his best regards.
- Where is sir Duplessis?

522
00:48:51,305 --> 00:48:53,349
- Where is the orchestra?
- Try to have patient.

523
00:48:53,474 --> 00:48:56,143
We travel no stop for
many weeks

524
00:48:56,227 --> 00:48:57,603
Everybody are
obnoxiously exhausting

525
00:48:57,728 --> 00:48:59,689
- Yes I see that.
- You can't see squat.

526
00:48:59,814 --> 00:49:02,358
Let's venture ourselves to the hotel!
Do I make me understood well?

527
00:49:02,441 --> 00:49:03,359
Very well.

528
00:49:10,158 --> 00:49:14,954
Good evening.
Welcome to the Bristol. This way, please.

529
00:49:40,062 --> 00:49:43,566
One at a time, gentlemen
Yes, just a moment

530
00:49:43,691 --> 00:49:47,904
Mr... Mr. Gorshin?
5-0-9, Mr Vilikov.

531
00:49:47,987 --> 00:49:52,950
Tomorrow reharsal. In the evening Mr
Filipov will dine with...

532
00:49:53,075 --> 00:49:55,703
madame Anne Marie Jacquet.
As per your request.

533
00:49:55,786 --> 00:49:59,373
And to end the night, we have booked
the most beautiful bateau-mouche

534
00:49:59,499 --> 00:50:02,919
for a trip on the Sein.
It will last about 2 hours and 20 minutes

535
00:50:03,002 --> 00:50:04,962
- What about the Trou Normand?
- That is for tonight.

536
00:50:05,087 --> 00:50:08,841
- We have reserved the whole place.
- Cheater, thief!

537
00:50:08,925 --> 00:50:11,844
- Give it to us, bastard!
- What's wrong with him?

538
00:50:11,969 --> 00:50:16,349
- We want half of everything.
- Cigarettes. To smoke.

539
00:50:16,432 --> 00:50:19,435
- And drinks! Drinks!
- Expenses. They claim their travel expenses.

540
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:23,022
No problem, we will give you
all travel expenses tomorrow morning

541
00:50:23,189 --> 00:50:26,025
Give us the money. Bastard. Thief!
We will kill you!

542
00:50:26,234 --> 00:50:29,195
- There are no expenses tonight!
- Give us the money or we will kill you!

543
00:50:29,278 --> 00:50:31,906
You are waited at the Trou Normand
in half an hour for dinner!

544
00:50:31,989 --> 00:50:33,783
Our money! Shell it up!
You are a dirty thief!

545
00:50:33,908 --> 00:50:37,578
- Come on, let them reason
- I would pay them, if I were you...

546
00:50:37,662 --> 00:50:41,332
- Just a second, listen to me!
- They are savages!

547
00:50:41,415 --> 00:50:43,042
They will kill me.
They want their expenses immediately!

548
00:50:43,167 --> 00:50:44,627
- They will wait
- No, no, no they won't!

549
00:50:44,752 --> 00:50:47,046
I cannot take money on my credit card
for the whole orchestra!

550
00:50:47,171 --> 00:50:48,422
- Why not?
- Mr Duplessis...

551
00:50:48,548 --> 00:50:50,675
Last time you have reimbursed me
four months later!

552
00:50:50,758 --> 00:50:53,052
They took away credit card and
cheques from me for a whole year!

553
00:50:53,135 --> 00:50:55,763
- But they gave them back in the end
- Yes they gave them back. Just yesterday!

554
00:50:55,847 --> 00:50:59,433
Then don't blast my balls!
Give them the money or you're fired!

555
00:50:59,517 --> 00:51:01,978
- Alright, Mr Duplessis.
- Did you understand what I said?

556
00:51:02,103 --> 00:51:03,479
Sure, there's no problem.

557
00:51:03,604 --> 00:51:06,774
Gentlemen, attention please

558
00:51:06,899 --> 00:51:11,779
Gentlemen, listen to me
Our young friend here

559
00:51:11,863 --> 00:51:16,659
understands your needs,
and he brought us the money

560
00:51:16,742 --> 00:51:19,495
Hurray!

561
00:51:19,579 --> 00:51:24,458
- Comrades, don't push!
- You need to sign a receipt

562
00:51:24,584 --> 00:51:26,377
We are waited for dinner at the
Trou Normand! Let's go eat!

563
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,838
- One at a time, the receipt!
- Let's go to the Trou Normand!

564
00:51:28,963 --> 00:51:31,507
Calm down, calm down!

565
00:51:31,591 --> 00:51:34,427
Slow down! One hundred euros each.

566
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:37,847
Thanks. Ah, sir.
Calm down, I beg you!

567
00:51:53,988 --> 00:51:59,035
Tomorrow morning reharsal
The van leaves at 10.00am sharp.

568
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:02,079
Don't be late, I beg you!

569
00:52:12,798 --> 00:52:15,510
Have you got a key?

570
00:52:26,979 --> 00:52:28,773
Yes, it's me.

571
00:52:29,273 --> 00:52:32,860
O my God. Guylene!

572
00:52:33,361 --> 00:52:37,114
I am... happiness to see you.

573
00:52:37,198 --> 00:52:42,078
- How are you? You is not changed.
- Of course, sit down.

574
00:52:46,415 --> 00:52:50,086
Be honest.
Did you come to speak with her?

575
00:52:50,169 --> 00:52:52,880
Why you talk this?
Me not at all

576
00:52:52,964 --> 00:52:55,591
Are you sure?

577
00:52:55,675 --> 00:52:58,427
Look me in the eyes.

578
00:52:59,637 --> 00:53:04,600
I have only come for concerto
She has got her life, she is grown up

579
00:53:04,934 --> 00:53:08,771
I don't want problems. It's already
difficult enough as it is

580
00:53:08,896 --> 00:53:13,109
I can never do this
What do you think am...

581
00:53:13,651 --> 00:53:18,364
- you thinks that I can... never.
- Good. We agree then.

582
00:53:18,447 --> 00:53:21,075
Right, Andrei?

583
00:53:21,534 --> 00:53:24,954
Good night.

584
00:53:26,122 --> 00:53:27,999
Good night.

585
00:54:08,331 --> 00:54:11,584
Excuse yourself, Sir.
Have you by god visioned the others?

586
00:54:11,709 --> 00:54:14,378
- They have all gone
- To Trou Normand, alone?

587
00:54:14,462 --> 00:54:17,882
I don't know, maybe
they have walked there

588
00:54:29,602 --> 00:54:32,355
- Yes
- are you ready? I am starving

589
00:54:32,438 --> 00:54:36,192
Andrei, do you really intend to
play Cajkovskij serenade?

590
00:54:36,317 --> 00:54:38,528
And Prokofiev number 1?
You hate Prokofiev.

591
00:54:38,653 --> 00:54:40,947
We will play Cajkovskij
and nothing else.

592
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:43,866
I don't care of the serenade
and of Prokofiev.

593
00:54:43,991 --> 00:54:48,454
- New shoes. Show them to me.
- Don't touch.

594
00:54:52,375 --> 00:54:56,671
- You have got all Anne Marie Jacquet CDs!
- From first to last.

595
00:54:56,796 --> 00:54:59,549
And all newspaper articles
I have managed to find

596
00:54:59,674 --> 00:55:02,927
You never say! So you are a
big fan.... or maybe....

597
00:55:03,511 --> 00:55:06,472
- how is it going with Irina?
- Sacha, try to think.

598
00:55:06,556 --> 00:55:10,560
- How old is she, do you think?
- Who? Anne marie jacquet?

599
00:55:10,977 --> 00:55:14,147
- Twentysix at most
- Not quite. Look at her better.

600
00:55:14,522 --> 00:55:18,442
She is twentynine.
What happened twentynine years ago?

601
00:55:18,526 --> 00:55:21,445
How would I know?

602
00:55:24,866 --> 00:55:29,495
By God, you don't mean that
she.... she is...

603
00:55:31,289 --> 00:55:34,792
Yes. Congratulations.
You managed to understand.

604
00:55:35,126 --> 00:55:36,669
It's her!

605
00:55:36,752 --> 00:55:39,839
French Communist Party

606
00:56:03,946 --> 00:56:05,656
- Good evening sir.
- Good evening to you.

607
00:56:05,781 --> 00:56:10,161
- Good evening.
- Is this the Trou Normand?

608
00:56:10,244 --> 00:56:14,248
Trou Normand, exactly.
This is the Trou Normand... and you?

609
00:56:14,332 --> 00:56:18,628
and you...
and you are the Bolshoi?

610
00:56:18,711 --> 00:56:21,797
Don't upset yourself, please.
The others won't be delayed

611
00:56:21,923 --> 00:56:25,259
- They will land from 8th arrondissement
- From the 8th! Very beautiful 8th

612
00:56:25,384 --> 00:56:28,137
by chance, comrade Maurice is
perveined?

613
00:56:29,222 --> 00:56:31,682
No, he is not perveined

614
00:56:33,142 --> 00:56:36,312
- Would you care to sit down?
- Many thanks.

615
00:56:36,437 --> 00:56:41,234
Not a problem, choose a sit.
Wherever. Here, there. Where you fancy.

616
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:43,152
- Here, here.
- Very good. Here you are.

617
00:56:43,236 --> 00:56:47,698
Jessica! Come on! We are starting.
Come on. The Bolshoi!

618
00:56:47,782 --> 00:56:53,621
Here we are! Please.
Yes, please?

619
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:03,756
One hamburger. The most least expensive.
No cheese. No bacon,

620
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:06,509
little meat, lots of bread...

621
00:57:07,301 --> 00:57:11,138
- ninetyfive cents.
- Really? Then make it two

622
00:57:11,264 --> 00:57:15,017
And two glasses of water,
inside the tap

623
00:57:17,353 --> 00:57:20,356
So much cheaper than the mcdonald
we have in Moscow

624
00:57:20,481 --> 00:57:23,442
I have even taken 10 bags of
mustard and ketchup each

625
00:57:23,526 --> 00:57:27,905
- They are free anyway
- Ivan is waiting for us at the Trou Normand

626
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:33,077
I am not going to have dinner with Kgb.
Does Irina know about all of this?

627
00:57:33,202 --> 00:57:35,413
- About Anne Marie Jacquet?
- Eh.

628
00:57:35,538 --> 00:57:38,207
- No, it's a secret.
- Have you ever spoken with Anne Marie?

629
00:57:38,291 --> 00:57:40,585
She doesn't know anything?

630
00:57:42,879 --> 00:57:47,341
You have come here just to direct
the orchestra, right?

631
00:57:47,466 --> 00:57:50,386
You can't mix the professional life
and private life

632
00:57:50,511 --> 00:57:54,015
You are here to direct... Cajkovskij.

633
00:57:54,724 --> 00:57:58,060
Only to direct Cajkovskij...
till the end.

634
00:57:58,352 --> 00:57:59,979
till the end.

635
00:58:04,317 --> 00:58:07,737
Promise me that you won't say
a word to Anne Marie

636
00:58:20,875 --> 00:58:22,835
What shall we do?
Shall we wait longer, sir?

637
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,796
No, no. Please table the foods.
I am very hunger

638
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:28,174
Perfect!
We are also very hunger!

639
00:58:32,678 --> 00:58:35,056
Yes, go.
More, more more.

640
00:58:36,557 --> 00:58:40,853
Are you already Teddy?
You sound so sad

641
00:58:41,646 --> 00:58:45,775
All is good, my love. It's just
that I miss you a bit, that's all

642
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:50,696
I miss you too, my Teddy.
Sleep well, you need to rest.

643
00:58:50,822 --> 00:58:57,245
Irina, I am afraid I can't do it.
I wish you were here, you know?

644
00:58:57,328 --> 00:59:01,958
But I am there, Teddy!
You will do it, I believe in you

645
00:59:02,083 --> 00:59:07,046
I hang up now, or we will spend too much.
I love you. Please call me before the concerto

646
00:59:07,171 --> 00:59:10,508
Have a great reharsal tomorrow.
Many kisses my love

647
00:59:10,633 --> 00:59:12,677
Kisses

648
00:59:25,439 --> 00:59:27,316
- There you go.
- What is this?

649
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,777
It's late, I am very sleep.
We close.

650
00:59:29,902 --> 00:59:33,322
It's ridiculous. You fart!
Do you royally believe that

651
00:59:33,447 --> 00:59:36,534
I will shell 1107 euro
for a jar of cous cous?

652
00:59:36,659 --> 00:59:39,662
- It was for 60 people.
- But I was only me.

653
00:59:39,787 --> 00:59:43,040
I am not talking about the food you had,
but of the food I cooked

654
00:59:43,124 --> 00:59:45,793
and I had to throw away.
I should make you pay double for this.

655
00:59:45,877 --> 00:59:48,171
- No more talking, please pay
- But it is the Chatelet Theater

656
00:59:48,254 --> 00:59:51,507
that has to remunerate!
They reserved the reservation!

657
00:59:51,591 --> 00:59:54,218
Listen to me. I will let you
belly dance on this table

658
00:59:54,302 --> 00:59:58,431
for the rest of your life if you don't pay.
My name is Ahmed al Qaeda.

659
00:59:58,514 --> 01:00:01,851
- Yes yes yes. I pour, I pour it all
- Good. Pour.

660
01:00:12,612 --> 01:00:14,155
You have delay. Were was you?

661
01:00:14,238 --> 01:00:18,367
I am sorry Ivan but I had to attend
an endless party committee

662
01:00:18,493 --> 01:00:22,538
- I am happy to see you
- what happened to the trou normand?

663
01:00:22,663 --> 01:00:25,833
- It was our headquarter
- Ah... we lost some members

664
01:00:25,917 --> 01:00:28,628
we had to sell.
We will need to sell the direction too

665
01:00:28,711 --> 01:00:31,964
There are more offices than members.
We can't cover up expenses

666
01:00:32,089 --> 01:00:34,133
Let's go to a french bistrot,
would it suit yourself?

667
01:00:34,258 --> 01:00:37,053
True French coffee
You need to ransack

668
01:00:41,724 --> 01:00:44,018
It's now the time
of a true change

669
01:00:44,143 --> 01:00:46,854
To put back the communist party
on the roof of France

670
01:00:46,938 --> 01:00:50,608
and of the world!
To shine the example to all!

671
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:52,527
Are you alert?

672
01:00:55,488 --> 01:00:58,574
Russian Television

673
01:01:13,714 --> 01:01:16,008
Good morning.

674
01:01:19,554 --> 01:01:22,640
Maestro! Mr Filipov.
What a pleasure to have you here.

675
01:01:22,765 --> 01:01:25,852
It's all sold out, your fans
have answered to your call

676
01:01:25,935 --> 01:01:29,272
Maestro, we did not forget you
There is not one free seat

677
01:01:29,355 --> 01:01:31,399
- Wonderful, right?
- Spaciba bolchoi.

678
01:01:31,482 --> 01:01:34,735
Olivier Morne Duplessis,
to honor you and eternally grateful

679
01:01:34,861 --> 01:01:38,114
- Spaciba bolchoi
- What's up, do you think I am crazy?

680
01:01:38,239 --> 01:01:40,032
Why do you keep saying that,
I know you are the Bolshoi

681
01:01:40,116 --> 01:01:43,452
no! Bolshoi means "big",
I thank you "very much"

682
01:01:43,536 --> 01:01:46,789
On, in that case, thanks
bolshoi to you!

683
01:01:48,249 --> 01:01:49,959
He kidnapped my hand

684
01:01:50,418 --> 01:01:52,628
can we fill this
areal to the maximum?

685
01:01:52,753 --> 01:01:57,633
Don't worry, we have a thousand members
One per cent at the election. Almost two!

686
01:01:57,717 --> 01:02:01,387
So, 44 millions voters,
divided by....

687
01:02:01,470 --> 01:02:04,390
we will place it right there,
alright?

688
01:02:04,473 --> 01:02:08,227
- What is it?
- The flag! The symbol!

689
01:02:08,352 --> 01:02:12,482
Of the party congress in
Moscow 1966.

690
01:02:12,565 --> 01:02:14,859
Can you memorize those elections, momo?

691
01:02:14,984 --> 01:02:18,488
Hundred per cent of votes.
Hundred per cent.

692
01:02:18,905 --> 01:02:22,575
The whole people unified
by a just cause

693
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:28,247
How can I forget. Hundred per cent.
Nobody has ever done better

694
01:02:28,331 --> 01:02:35,087
Oh, I am delayed.
I need to speed me up. I entrust it to you

695
01:02:35,630 --> 01:02:39,300
Come, come. Trust me, come.

696
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:45,973
- Start with the cables, come on
- Hurry up

697
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:49,477
Mr Duplessis, can I have my money back
They stopped my credit card

698
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,521
I need to give a cheque to the bank
by four o'clock

699
01:02:51,646 --> 01:02:54,357
- Calm down. Everything at its time
- But this is its time!

700
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:57,527
Yesterday I saved them. They were
in a russian restaurant, not at the
trou normand.

701
01:02:57,610 --> 01:02:59,237
And I have had to pay the bill
for all of them

702
01:02:59,362 --> 01:03:01,656
At six o clock in the morning
1500 euro of drinks

703
01:03:01,739 --> 01:03:03,616
they did not eat.
I gave them an uncovered cheque

704
01:03:03,699 --> 01:03:06,160
If you saved them, as you say,
where are them now?

705
01:03:06,244 --> 01:03:08,621
Can you hear any music, by chance?
Any unknown Cajkovskij?

706
01:03:08,704 --> 01:03:11,374
A "Silence for violin and orchestra"?

707
01:03:11,457 --> 01:03:15,837
A problem in communication?
It's an orchestra or a quartet?

708
01:03:15,962 --> 01:03:17,755
Where is the orchestra, Mr Filipov?
Where is it?

709
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:22,176
I am honorable to re-meet you.
Do not bother yourself, please

710
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:24,720
They will come here
very immediately

711
01:03:24,804 --> 01:03:27,807
They are not French, believe me.
And not at all Germans.

712
01:03:27,932 --> 01:03:30,935
For Russian people, it is a
matter of education

713
01:03:31,018 --> 01:03:33,479
to overcome a bit in delay.
Try to understand this.

714
01:03:33,563 --> 01:03:35,773
- It shows you a courtesy
- Ivan gavrilov?

715
01:03:35,857 --> 01:03:37,316
- Yes.
- You are late!

716
01:03:37,441 --> 01:03:39,735
With all your goddamn
spasiba bolchoi!

717
01:03:39,819 --> 01:03:42,905
Why should have we picked them Russian!
Americans, English even better...

718
01:03:42,989 --> 01:03:45,908
Where are them? Where are them?
This is your job!

719
01:03:45,992 --> 01:03:48,995
Not too expensive, caviar, taste

720
01:03:49,328 --> 01:03:53,958
- How much?
- 200 euro. Friendly price

721
01:03:54,083 --> 01:03:56,294
More than in a supermarket!
No, thanks.

722
01:03:56,419 --> 01:04:00,089
- But it is better, isn't it?
- No.

723
01:04:04,677 --> 01:04:07,138
- Caviar is not in anymore
- Do you want to teach me my trade?

724
01:04:07,263 --> 01:04:10,516
Dad, if we had chinese mobile
phones, we would have sold out by now!

725
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:14,187
A russian Jew selling Chinese mobile
phones? It's a sin!

726
01:04:14,270 --> 01:04:16,814
It's like a pigmey cooking
a catfish

727
01:04:16,898 --> 01:04:18,524
even if it is organic, it is
still not kosher

728
01:04:28,117 --> 01:04:33,080
- dear, so good to meet you
- my pleasure

729
01:04:33,164 --> 01:04:35,458
Hurry up!

730
01:04:41,255 --> 01:04:43,883
Here is our maestro!

731
01:04:49,931 --> 01:04:53,351
- Glad to meet you
- Nice to meet you too

732
01:04:54,769 --> 01:04:58,773
It is really arousing to
meet you!

733
01:04:59,565 --> 01:05:01,526
We are a little late, but nothing
too serious

734
01:05:01,609 --> 01:05:04,695
- The Slav temperament, I imagine
- Yes, more or less

735
01:05:04,821 --> 01:05:07,490
- What about this one?
- Everything up there. Close to them.

736
01:05:07,573 --> 01:05:10,034
Ok, boss.
Igor, Yuri, up your arses!

737
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:12,453
Lady.
Get off the way!

738
01:05:16,749 --> 01:05:19,043
Can anybody get Jean Paul here?

739
01:05:22,713 --> 01:05:25,716
You could have brought the Chinese
mobile phones, smarty pants!

740
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,427
I did bring them, look!

741
01:05:28,511 --> 01:05:30,972
I have given one to each musician
to clear the customs

742
01:05:31,055 --> 01:05:33,891
Everybody except Andrei, Sacha e Ivan,
they don't know about this

743
01:05:33,975 --> 01:05:37,812
Fifty. Consim card. Free talking
world-wide. It's counterfeited!

744
01:05:37,895 --> 01:05:40,565
- a gread deal, daddy
- dear son!

745
01:05:40,648 --> 01:05:43,109
When your mother will know what
you have done! You are a genius

746
01:05:43,234 --> 01:05:46,904
Exactly like your dad!
We are rich, eventually!

747
01:05:47,029 --> 01:05:49,740
There is a problem, dad.
They guys won't give them back...

748
01:05:49,824 --> 01:05:53,244
- What? Who? Dumbass, call them.
- They don't pick up

749
01:05:53,286 --> 01:05:55,413
- Give that to me
- It's useless

750
01:05:55,538 --> 01:05:57,665
- Tell me their numbers
- They are in the phone

751
01:05:57,790 --> 01:06:02,670
Beware, don't scratch it
Watch out for the door

752
01:06:19,061 --> 01:06:22,648
Let's call their mobile.
They might be in a traffic jam

753
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:26,652
There is nobody in the hotel
We need to make it on our own

754
01:06:26,777 --> 01:06:30,281
How? Cajkovskij with only
three instruments?

755
01:06:30,448 --> 01:06:35,244
It's ridiculous! How long
shall we wait?

756
01:07:08,361 --> 01:07:11,197
No, don't stop. It's nice

757
01:07:11,781 --> 01:07:15,284
- What's your name, sir?
- Alexandr Abramovich Grossman.

758
01:07:15,368 --> 01:07:20,331
Pardon I beg, beg pardon
it is a very happy compliment for me

759
01:07:20,414 --> 01:07:25,711
I no good, bad I am,
greatest difficulty for me

760
01:07:25,795 --> 01:07:29,882
- I is the least good of the orchestra
- Are you joking?

761
01:07:30,383 --> 01:07:36,055
No really. Maestro tell me...
play! play! Sacha, bad bad

762
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:40,226
Others no play never. I always

763
01:07:40,351 --> 01:07:44,480
Need many play to get
good leveling

764
01:07:44,564 --> 01:07:48,401
It's true. I don't feel like trying
because there are cameras, you see...

765
01:07:48,526 --> 01:07:53,322
- It could kill the spontainety
- So no reharsal?

766
01:07:53,406 --> 01:07:58,995
No reharsal. We beg forgiveness
if you came here for nothing

767
01:07:59,078 --> 01:08:03,708
But we think spontainety is important.
Music is spontainety.

768
01:08:03,833 --> 01:08:07,336
Considering that Bolshoi's tecnique is...
.... so perfect...

769
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:11,716
You think we are snub,
I understand. But no is tecnique

770
01:08:11,799 --> 01:08:17,430
Soul. Spirit.
You ask where is musicians

771
01:08:17,513 --> 01:08:21,976
They are learning.
Suck inspiration in Paris.

772
01:08:22,101 --> 01:08:28,524
Ville Lumiere, Louvre, Rodin Museum,
Pompidou centre!

773
01:08:28,608 --> 01:08:32,361
- Right, Sacha?
- I am sorry! Andrei!

774
01:08:33,237 --> 01:08:36,240
They are my cousins who live here
The only instrument we are missing

775
01:08:36,324 --> 01:08:38,701
is a bagpipe. Unfortunately one
of our leases did not go well

776
01:08:38,784 --> 01:08:42,455
Police is everywhere here.

777
01:08:42,705 --> 01:08:45,249
Bring everything here
Put it on the chairs

778
01:08:45,333 --> 01:08:49,795
Violins here, reed on the other side.
Cello goes there, clarinet above that

779
01:08:49,879 --> 01:08:51,672
Costumes on the corner, come on

780
01:08:52,131 --> 01:08:56,761
Double bass and oboe up there
Flute goes close to the horn

781
01:08:56,886 --> 01:09:00,807
Shoes all here
There is the plug, start pressing

782
01:09:00,932 --> 01:09:02,725
Quick, we need to start

783
01:09:02,850 --> 01:09:07,730
Socks, come on, hurry
Come on, y'all

784
01:09:12,235 --> 01:09:14,987
So cool, Andrei

785
01:09:15,071 --> 01:09:19,367
We can rent it for weddings.
How much do they want for a night?

786
01:09:21,953 --> 01:09:24,664
That's enough.
Call Duplessis

787
01:10:14,172 --> 01:10:17,258
Here you go, darling
I don't steal

788
01:10:17,466 --> 01:10:20,386
- How did you do this?
- How did I do what?

789
01:10:20,511 --> 01:10:23,347
That arpeggio, so nice
How did you do that?

790
01:10:23,598 --> 01:10:26,142
- With me fingering!
- What technique did you use?

791
01:10:26,267 --> 01:10:29,020
I have never seen it before
Excuse me, where did you learn that

792
01:10:29,103 --> 01:10:32,607
Andrei! Where did you take
this babe from?

793
01:10:32,690 --> 01:10:34,484
What are you talking about?

794
01:10:37,195 --> 01:10:39,655
I beg your pardon

795
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:43,117
I am a bit confused

796
01:10:43,242 --> 01:10:44,869
- Shall we get rid of these things?
- I am sorry if I have been capricious

797
01:10:44,952 --> 01:10:48,122
- No problem, miss
- Come on, hurry!

798
01:10:48,247 --> 01:10:51,501
Can we have dinner tonight?
Are you still available?

799
01:10:51,584 --> 01:10:55,796
- Yes, of course
- Then tonight at 8.

800
01:10:56,214 --> 01:10:59,800
You do not have the TV rights.
Do you understand the word "rights"?

801
01:10:59,884 --> 01:11:03,304
I am the orchestra sponsor.
Without me there is no orchestra.

802
01:11:03,429 --> 01:11:06,349
- Do you understand the word "orchestra"?
- Don't be offensive, will you.

803
01:11:06,474 --> 01:11:09,977
- Who are you?
- The Director, Olivier Morne Duplessis.

804
01:11:10,102 --> 01:11:13,022
Never heard before.

805
01:11:13,147 --> 01:11:16,734
We have an exclusive contract
with France Television

806
01:11:16,859 --> 01:11:19,946
Your own problem. I did sell
the concerto to Russian tv

807
01:11:20,071 --> 01:11:23,574
Fifty million people will watch.
The president, my dear friend,

808
01:11:23,658 --> 01:11:26,911
will watch live via satellite.
I have invited him over

809
01:11:27,036 --> 01:11:28,037
in my dacia

810
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,957
Do you want us to cut the gas
provisions to western countries?

811
01:11:31,415 --> 01:11:33,292
Ask the germans what they
think about this...

812
01:11:33,417 --> 01:11:35,294
You wanted the russians....

813
01:11:35,378 --> 01:11:38,714
it's a situation we need to
solve, huh....

814
01:11:39,090 --> 01:11:40,716
it's specified in the contract

815
01:11:40,842 --> 01:11:42,885
that we are not responsible of
natural deportment

816
01:11:43,010 --> 01:11:44,095
natural deportment?

817
01:11:44,178 --> 01:11:46,722
Sure. A TV signal gets lost
in the sky....

818
01:11:46,806 --> 01:11:49,016
reaches the wrong satellite and

819
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:51,394
casually arrives to another country,
or another planet

820
01:11:51,477 --> 01:11:54,981
- It's a natural deportment
- We can't be on top of everything.

821
01:11:55,106 --> 01:11:59,026
There are satellites that capture
musical notes, various images

822
01:11:59,152 --> 01:12:03,698
- Do you agree, Mr Tretiakin?
- I don't give a shit

823
01:12:04,448 --> 01:12:09,412
We will find them, you see.
They won't sabotage us after all this

824
01:12:09,537 --> 01:12:10,872
- You don't believe it yourself
- Me?

825
01:12:10,955 --> 01:12:13,916
It's true. We are nothing else
than failures

826
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:20,339
What did I have in mind?
I am having a nightmare!

827
01:12:32,143 --> 01:12:36,939
It's them!
You are my orchestra!

828
01:12:50,912 --> 01:12:54,332
It's your fault, you're too fat!
You are fat and slow

829
01:12:54,457 --> 01:12:59,795
Do you want to go back down there.
I could spend the whole night searching.
Calm down

830
01:13:00,046 --> 01:13:02,089
- Finally
- Andrei. Mr. Duplessis.

831
01:13:02,173 --> 01:13:04,300
Silence please. I'll speak

832
01:13:04,383 --> 01:13:07,720
I have never seen such an
unprofessional behaviour

833
01:13:07,845 --> 01:13:10,306
Do you think I could swallow the story
of Russians not reharsing?

834
01:13:10,389 --> 01:13:13,226
- Mr. Duplessis, our orchestra...
- Don't say anymore

835
01:13:13,976 --> 01:13:19,106
Listen to me. This is a warning.
You have a contract and you need to honor it

836
01:13:19,232 --> 01:13:22,568
If you are not there tomorrow
two hours before the concerto, I cancel all

837
01:13:22,652 --> 01:13:26,239
You don't believe me?
I have done it once and I'll do it again

838
01:13:27,031 --> 01:13:31,994
- Nobody back yet?
- No. Not even the keys

839
01:13:32,078 --> 01:13:35,581
- I have placed a note under the door
- Don't give a fuck about notes or keys

840
01:13:35,706 --> 01:13:38,876
I have seen them in the metro,
go look for them

841
01:13:40,336 --> 01:13:43,756
- If you cancel it, we are all fired
- Do you think I am an idiot?

842
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,216
We have never sold so much

843
01:13:45,299 --> 01:13:48,052
Tv, radio, internet,
mobile phones, cd, dvds.

844
01:13:48,135 --> 01:13:52,431
The return of the legend, together with
Anne Marie Jacquet. Ah, fantastic!

845
01:13:52,557 --> 01:13:56,227
It's always the same thing
With Russians you need psychology

846
01:13:56,310 --> 01:13:58,980
you need to beat them up to
make them walk. Ah ah

847
01:13:59,272 --> 01:14:01,816
Send them a fax to the hotel
with tomorrow schedule

848
01:14:01,941 --> 01:14:04,068
So they have no excuses to delay

849
01:14:04,193 --> 01:14:07,780
Ok, I'll send it pronto
Urgent fax to the Bolshoi

850
01:14:22,253 --> 01:14:25,840
- Please, sir.
- Leonid Dmitrievich, a fax for you!

851
01:14:25,923 --> 01:14:29,760
It can wait. I am on holiday.
I'll go for a nice trip. Paris!

852
01:14:50,281 --> 01:14:53,784
- To the concert.
- To the concert.

853
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:05,046
- Mr Filipov...
- Andrei. If you don't mind

854
01:15:05,129 --> 01:15:09,050
Is it true that you had to fight the
regime to defend jewish musicians?

855
01:15:09,175 --> 01:15:12,261
And not only them, but the whole orchestra...

856
01:15:12,470 --> 01:15:17,266
It was nothing heroic
Understand?

857
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:21,354
There was not much choice.
Difficult time.

858
01:15:21,437 --> 01:15:26,567
- Complex... complex choices...
- Yes

859
01:15:26,692 --> 01:15:30,988
we had to do. understand?

860
01:15:36,410 --> 01:15:41,123
This concerto... is...
like... understand?

861
01:15:41,916 --> 01:15:47,588
A confession.
A cry.

862
01:15:47,713 --> 01:15:51,884
There is a life in each note, Anne Marie.

863
01:15:51,968 --> 01:15:59,851
Notes... all... search...
harmony. Search... happiness

864
01:16:02,061 --> 01:16:06,232
- Can I confide something in you?
- Yes

865
01:16:06,315 --> 01:16:09,986
I have been raised by an
extraordinary person

866
01:16:10,069 --> 01:16:14,699
Guylene. You have seen her, at the
reharsals. She is a mother to me

867
01:16:14,782 --> 01:16:18,619
Besides being my agent,
my manager.... she is a friend

868
01:16:18,703 --> 01:16:22,206
The only one I have

869
01:16:23,082 --> 01:16:26,836
I have not met my parents

870
01:16:27,879 --> 01:16:32,842
- I beg your pardon.
- No, you don't have to

871
01:16:32,967 --> 01:16:36,053
I beg you. Continue

872
01:16:39,098 --> 01:16:42,768
I am looking for the eyes of my
parents since I was a baby

873
01:16:42,894 --> 01:16:46,814
Everywhere, on the streets

874
01:16:47,523 --> 01:16:54,197
When I play, I'd like to have
their glance.... on me

875
01:16:54,822 --> 01:16:59,452
For an instant.
Just a second

876
01:17:00,912 --> 01:17:05,458
They were brilliant people,
Richard and Sophie Jacquet.

877
01:17:05,541 --> 01:17:10,421
Two great scientists.
He was a biologist, she was an
anthropologist

878
01:17:12,048 --> 01:17:16,260
Guylene told me, she was their
best friend

879
01:17:17,053 --> 01:17:19,597
They died right after I was born

880
01:17:21,724 --> 01:17:25,228
A plane crash, on the alpes

881
01:17:25,770 --> 01:17:28,773
All right, gentlemen?

882
01:17:29,065 --> 01:17:30,858
Sir.

883
01:17:43,663 --> 01:17:47,166
I introduce you Ivan Tikhomirov
and Igor Nabokov.

884
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:48,501
- My pleasure.
- Pleasure

885
01:17:48,584 --> 01:17:51,587
Great musicians.

886
01:17:52,088 --> 01:17:54,048
- What a night, huh?
- Paris is magic!

887
01:17:54,173 --> 01:17:57,927
Who are you calling? Who?

888
01:17:58,010 --> 01:18:00,930
- Don't worry, everything is alright
- It's a beautiful night, yes.

889
01:18:01,013 --> 01:18:05,476
Eventually I managed to fulfill my dream
to come to Paris

890
01:18:05,601 --> 01:18:09,438
What a joy to play this wonderful
theathre. Chatelet!

891
01:18:09,564 --> 01:18:12,316
Dad, they said 10 o clock. They are
not here. They left, can you see?

892
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:15,194
It was 10.30

893
01:18:15,987 --> 01:18:19,490
Come on, then.
On the Bateau-mouche.

894
01:18:27,832 --> 01:18:30,126
Why did you ask for me?

895
01:18:37,341 --> 01:18:42,138
I very worked much... at
concerto Cajkovskij.

896
01:18:42,597 --> 01:18:47,727
Because I maniac.
Ill.... understand?

897
01:18:48,561 --> 01:18:54,317
I always think... concerto....
reach... supreme harmony

898
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:58,654
Musical absolute.
Perfection

899
01:19:00,031 --> 01:19:05,703
Then I searched...
solo violin.

900
01:19:05,912 --> 01:19:12,752
I found. Lea. Lea Strum.
Brilliant, unique

901
01:19:13,628 --> 01:19:19,133
Big friends immediately. All big
friends then, Lea, Yitzhak, her husband

902
01:19:20,051 --> 01:19:25,681
We continue to practice.
Search. Not a normal life

903
01:19:27,809 --> 01:19:30,770
Crazy

904
01:19:31,813 --> 01:19:37,109
One day my friend told me Breznev
wants to kick out jewish

905
01:19:37,193 --> 01:19:43,032
I go panic
Lea is jewish

906
01:19:43,950 --> 01:19:49,372
Together we decide...
to play concerto Cajkovskij.

907
01:19:49,497 --> 01:19:56,003
I did not defend jewish,
Anne Marie.

908
01:19:56,671 --> 01:20:04,303
I, selfish, defend concerto.
Crazy dream

909
01:20:05,346 --> 01:20:13,354
Me needed, Lea and jewish...
to reach harmony

910
01:20:18,901 --> 01:20:21,362
Then?

911
01:20:21,445 --> 01:20:26,659
12 june 1980.

912
01:20:29,871 --> 01:20:31,581
Concerto.

913
01:20:31,664 --> 01:20:33,791
- were you ready?
- No.

914
01:20:34,542 --> 01:20:37,712
Yes. How you know?

915
01:20:45,511 --> 01:20:49,182
Bolshoi theathre.

916
01:20:50,266 --> 01:20:53,186
Sold out.

917
01:20:53,269 --> 01:20:57,273
Many people.
World journalists

918
01:20:57,356 --> 01:21:01,277
Managers, musicians.

919
01:21:03,988 --> 01:21:06,449
Concerto.

920
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:10,244
Start

921
01:21:10,745 --> 01:21:13,915
Miracle happens

922
01:21:18,753 --> 01:21:21,422
Sublime.

923
01:21:22,423 --> 01:21:28,095
Magic violin raises
me and orchestra...

924
01:21:28,429 --> 01:21:35,144
towards heaven.
higher and higher.

925
01:21:35,478 --> 01:21:44,487
We and audience fly to
supreme harmony

926
01:21:55,748 --> 01:22:01,170
But concerto interrupted at half
Never arrived to supreme harmony

927
01:22:01,879 --> 01:22:06,843
Breznev stopped concerto at half
to humiliate us in front of audience

928
01:22:07,677 --> 01:22:12,557
Breznev cut winds
We fell to floor

929
01:22:13,808 --> 01:22:16,477
Then...

930
01:22:17,603 --> 01:22:23,359
Jewish all out
Lea, Sacha, all.

931
01:22:24,026 --> 01:22:27,780
- You have been sent away as well?
- Yes but all had ended

932
01:22:27,864 --> 01:22:31,033
I could play not with not them

933
01:22:34,662 --> 01:22:36,455
What happened to Lea?

934
01:22:36,873 --> 01:22:40,042
Lea and Yitzhak have done
interview at Radio Free Europe.

935
01:22:40,126 --> 01:22:44,255
American radio, forbidden in
Soviet Union. Them...

936
01:22:46,090 --> 01:22:51,304
criticize Breznev.
understand?

937
01:22:56,434 --> 01:23:00,021
- Then?
- Nothing.

938
01:23:04,525 --> 01:23:07,069
You want me to replace Lea

939
01:23:08,905 --> 01:23:11,991
She did not want me

940
01:23:15,369 --> 01:23:17,747
I am not Lea, though.

941
01:23:19,290 --> 01:23:22,877
You have not directed for 30 years.
I have never played Cajkovskij.

942
01:23:23,002 --> 01:23:25,755
We have never even reharsed

943
01:23:27,006 --> 01:23:30,343
I understand your story,
your sorrow

944
01:23:31,803 --> 01:23:34,180
But I am not Lea

945
01:23:34,972 --> 01:23:38,559
And together we will not
reach supreme harmony

946
01:23:39,769 --> 01:23:42,313
I dreamt this concerto

947
01:23:42,939 --> 01:23:45,066
together with her

948
01:23:47,443 --> 01:23:50,696
You should see a doctor

949
01:23:52,031 --> 01:23:54,742
You cannot make the past happen again

950
01:23:58,246 --> 01:24:00,915
I don't think we should do this
concerto together

951
01:24:00,998 --> 01:24:04,335
It is a sure failure

952
01:24:06,295 --> 01:24:08,756
Do you want me to take you home?

953
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:19,350
- When he wants to, please call him a taxi.
- Yes, madam

954
01:24:21,227 --> 01:24:26,274
I will do it.
I am very sorry

955
01:24:55,803 --> 01:24:57,930
yes

956
01:25:00,433 --> 01:25:02,477
Then?

957
01:25:02,894 --> 01:25:04,937
Nothing

958
01:25:06,397 --> 01:25:13,362
- What happened?
- Nothing. Cancel the Chatelet

959
01:25:22,747 --> 01:25:25,291
- You really could not avoid it, huh?
- Don't yell at me

960
01:25:25,374 --> 01:25:30,004
- Nobody is yelling. And the vodka?
- It's French

961
01:25:30,087 --> 01:25:32,215
Stupid

962
01:25:32,632 --> 01:25:35,885
It's over, it's all over

963
01:25:36,886 --> 01:25:41,432
Concerto, cajkovskij,
the orchestra, Anne Marie, kaput.

964
01:25:41,808 --> 01:25:44,644
Good job Breznev, you won again

965
01:25:44,727 --> 01:25:51,484
Irina deserved children, a good husband
I destroyed her life. Give this to her

966
01:25:51,567 --> 01:25:55,738
You give it to her. Don't do the
same mistake twice

967
01:25:55,822 --> 01:25:58,825
What happened then it was none
of your fault

968
01:25:58,950 --> 01:26:03,579
- I brought Lea to be crazy
- Not true

969
01:26:04,330 --> 01:26:08,626
She was possessed of your
same folly

970
01:26:11,754 --> 01:26:14,507
Let's go, let's go
come one

971
01:26:15,883 --> 01:26:16,634
Gentlemen.

972
01:26:36,863 --> 01:26:39,657
Guylene, beg you, beg you.
I speak need with her

973
01:26:39,740 --> 01:26:42,535
He too much alchool.
Drunk. Say stupidity

974
01:26:42,618 --> 01:26:46,789
Very... emotioned for you.
But does nothing!

975
01:26:46,873 --> 01:26:50,209
Beg you. Concerto,
the most important for him

976
01:26:50,334 --> 01:26:53,504
No concerto, dead!
You kill him

977
01:26:53,588 --> 01:26:58,634
- Sir, please go away
- Guylene! Let him in

978
01:26:59,177 --> 01:27:01,888
You don't have any rights

979
01:27:01,971 --> 01:27:06,184
- Most good in world. Breznev...
- I know the story

980
01:27:06,476 --> 01:27:10,771
Career finished, he ruined.
He most biggest director

981
01:27:10,897 --> 01:27:15,276
He genius. They transformed
him in failure

982
01:27:15,359 --> 01:27:20,072
- Him alcohol.. alcohol...
- alcoholic

983
01:27:20,156 --> 01:27:25,369
- Alcoholic. I jewish like...
- Lea e Yitzhak Strum, I know.

984
01:27:25,453 --> 01:27:29,999
I do not ask you you love Andrei
Just, play violin

985
01:27:30,124 --> 01:27:34,504
Beg you.
You come, play concerto

986
01:27:37,298 --> 01:27:41,302
I am very sorry for Mr.
Filipov and his friends

987
01:27:41,928 --> 01:27:46,224
But a concerto will never be
a psychotherapy sitting for me

988
01:27:46,974 --> 01:27:49,769
That man is sick

989
01:27:49,852 --> 01:27:52,772
He asks me to become somebody else

990
01:27:54,065 --> 01:27:58,110
To dive into the same folly of
that unluck violinist

991
01:28:01,614 --> 01:28:05,535
I don't want to do that.
Goodbye.

992
01:28:06,869 --> 01:28:09,872
Sir...

993
01:28:15,586 --> 01:28:22,635
what if... after concerto...
you find... your parents?

994
01:28:28,391 --> 01:28:30,935
What do you mean?

995
01:28:31,769 --> 01:28:34,772
Well, that...

996
01:28:34,897 --> 01:28:37,358
Oh my god.

997
01:28:37,942 --> 01:28:41,112
Music very often help
we to grow

998
01:28:41,195 --> 01:28:45,324
Give answers to us
We afraid

999
01:28:45,408 --> 01:28:50,204
We afraid, before play music
Afraid of truth

1000
01:28:50,955 --> 01:28:55,918
I don't understand you.
Speak clearly

1001
01:28:57,587 --> 01:29:02,550
Clearly? Nothing clearly

1002
01:29:02,633 --> 01:29:05,178
Nothing ever clearly

1003
01:29:05,261 --> 01:29:10,308
I poor idiot, all wrong in my
life, all lost,

1004
01:29:10,433 --> 01:29:15,062
wife, children, and I give
lessons to you

1005
01:29:16,022 --> 01:29:21,694
You ask me words. But words are
dirty, words are betray

1006
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:27,533
Only music is still beauty.
But music is trapped in us.

1007
01:29:27,617 --> 01:29:32,497
Music no want to get out of us

1008
01:29:32,914 --> 01:29:35,291
Why?

1009
01:29:37,793 --> 01:29:42,256
Beg pardon to bother.
Pardon.

1010
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:47,553
Goodbye
Goodbye, Guylene

1011
01:30:12,578 --> 01:30:14,372
Mr Grossman.

1012
01:30:16,249 --> 01:30:19,752
Either you said too little...
or too much....

1013
01:30:19,836 --> 01:30:23,881
Why do you know Guylene?
And what does it mean:

1014
01:30:24,465 --> 01:30:28,511
"after concerto,
you find your parents"?

1015
01:30:29,428 --> 01:30:32,515
And you are jewish?
You don't care about shabbat or kippur.

1016
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:34,934
Do you think it's good enough to be called
Moses to be jewish?

1017
01:30:35,017 --> 01:30:37,228
How do you think to speak with God
using a fax?

1018
01:30:37,353 --> 01:30:41,983
- Please answer me.
- Sacha!

1019
01:30:42,483 --> 01:30:46,863
You are so pale
Do you need an aspirin?

1020
01:30:46,988 --> 01:30:49,365
Madam

1021
01:30:49,782 --> 01:30:53,995
Shut up. Madam,
forgive me. Goodbye.

1022
01:30:54,078 --> 01:30:57,165
Ah... she... she... she...

1023
01:31:15,892 --> 01:31:20,188
My dear, play this concerto,
play cajkovskij.

1024
01:31:20,396 --> 01:31:24,233
At the end, maybe you will find
out the truth about your parent

1025
01:31:24,317 --> 01:31:27,320
I am sorry if I lied to you
for all these many years

1026
01:31:27,403 --> 01:31:30,740
I wanted to protect you
To take care of you

1027
01:31:31,073 --> 01:31:36,746
Many years ago Andrei Filipov gave me
Lea Strum hand written score

1028
01:31:36,871 --> 01:31:40,041
I give it to you. It's yours.
Don't look for me.

1029
01:31:40,166 --> 01:31:43,169
When you will read these words
I will be already far away

1030
01:31:43,294 --> 01:31:45,838
I love you. Guylene.

1031
01:32:42,395 --> 01:32:45,398
- Hotel Paris lumiere.
- Sacha Grossman, please.

1032
01:32:46,232 --> 01:32:53,030
Eternal bliss give to him, my Lord,
and perpetual light shines on him...

1033
01:33:11,257 --> 01:33:13,718
Come back. for Lea.

1034
01:33:21,184 --> 01:33:23,311
Paris

1035
01:33:24,812 --> 01:33:26,772
Stop, stop, stop

1036
01:33:46,626 --> 01:33:52,381
Tonight only!
I AM THE Bolshoi!

1037
01:34:31,212 --> 01:34:36,342
Tonight no talk of money.
Cajkovskij. It will be magical

1038
01:34:36,551 --> 01:34:42,140
No money tonight. Just music.
Cajkovskij. The composer.

1039
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:45,268
- Madame Minister, Sir.
- Good evening.

1040
01:34:45,351 --> 01:34:46,519
- Your excellency.
- Good evening

1041
01:34:46,602 --> 01:34:49,313
- Ambassador. Madam.
- Good evening

1042
01:34:49,397 --> 01:34:50,148
- Evening
- Evening

1043
01:34:50,231 --> 01:34:54,068
where are our seats?

1044
01:34:54,193 --> 01:34:55,695
I, don't...

1045
01:35:03,286 --> 01:35:06,455
fiftyone, fiftytwo and
fifty three

1046
01:35:06,539 --> 01:35:08,833
- who is missing?
- Sacha. Calm down, they will get here.

1047
01:35:08,916 --> 01:35:12,503
- Trumpets. Viktor and his son.
- They have sent us a sms

1048
01:35:12,628 --> 01:35:16,215
- Call them then!
- They took away my mobile

1049
01:35:16,507 --> 01:35:20,720
All straight, then right at the river
and left on Chatelet square

1050
01:35:20,845 --> 01:35:24,515
How can you live in Paris.
You don't know Chatelet theathre?

1051
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:27,185
- What does it mean "later"?
- Means see you later

1052
01:35:27,268 --> 01:35:31,105
- you cannot leave
- you are here, that is the important part

1053
01:35:31,230 --> 01:35:33,774
I have been listening Cajkovskij for
thirty years, I know him by heart

1054
01:35:33,900 --> 01:35:35,943
More than his mother or himself.
I have better things to do

1055
01:35:36,027 --> 01:35:38,237
There is no more important things, Ivan,
of the concerto

1056
01:35:38,362 --> 01:35:42,909
Sure there is. My speech at the party.
There is a big committee

1057
01:35:43,034 --> 01:35:44,994
- Let me go.
- You came all the way to Paris

1058
01:35:45,119 --> 01:35:47,330
just for a pathetic party
committee?

1059
01:35:47,455 --> 01:35:49,749
Don't you have enough of your
shitty speeches in Moscow?

1060
01:35:49,832 --> 01:35:54,086
You don't understand. I came here
to build the biggest dream.

1061
01:35:54,170 --> 01:35:56,714
Do you understand me?
The biggest dream!

1062
01:35:56,798 --> 01:35:59,759
I know what you mean....
"Proletariat of the world, get united!"

1063
01:35:59,842 --> 01:36:01,719
United... one against the other.

1064
01:36:01,803 --> 01:36:05,932
You are so selfish. You only care
about the concerto

1065
01:36:06,015 --> 01:36:09,101
you think about yourself.
just yourself!

1066
01:36:09,227 --> 01:36:14,273
The orchestra is a world.
Ivan, ivan, a world.

1067
01:36:14,357 --> 01:36:18,110
Everybody contributes with his own
istrument. With his talent

1068
01:36:18,194 --> 01:36:22,031
For the time of a concerto, we are all
united and we play together.

1069
01:36:22,156 --> 01:36:26,869
Hoping to arrive to a magic sound.
To harmony.

1070
01:36:26,953 --> 01:36:30,289
This is the real communism

1071
01:36:30,540 --> 01:36:33,167
For the length of a concerto

1072
01:36:51,185 --> 01:36:55,231
Maestro! Can I introduce you to
Raymond Laudeyrac?

1073
01:36:55,356 --> 01:37:00,862
It's a great pleasure. I cannot wait
to hear your... ideas.

1074
01:37:02,196 --> 01:37:05,616
It's our most influential critic, but
don't worry, he is always like that

1075
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:08,077
He detests russian music,
especially Cajkovskij.

1076
01:37:08,202 --> 01:37:10,955
Good luck, it will be a success!

1077
01:37:15,418 --> 01:37:19,338
Anne marie, this is Olivier. I am with
Laudeyrac who wants to say hi.

1078
01:37:33,478 --> 01:37:37,064
All together towards tomorrow

1079
01:37:37,190 --> 01:37:42,403
Comrades! Comrades!
The moment has come!

1080
01:37:42,487 --> 01:37:46,866
Once again Moscow supports us and
it sent us....

1081
01:37:46,991 --> 01:37:51,370
Ivan Gavrilov!
A real russian leader!

1082
01:37:55,917 --> 01:37:59,962
- Ivan Gavrilov, you?
- No! Thank God you are here!

1083
01:38:00,046 --> 01:38:03,466
A scandal, a real dishonor!
I was alone, I have been crushed

1084
01:38:03,549 --> 01:38:05,426
Jewish got back in charge!

1085
01:38:05,551 --> 01:38:08,095
Leonid, it's the providence who
brought you back to help me

1086
01:38:08,179 --> 01:38:10,556
Quick quick, they are about
to start

1087
01:38:10,681 --> 01:38:12,391
hurry up
that way

1088
01:38:12,517 --> 01:38:16,187
Camera 1 on me, close up.
Camera 2 on me, very close up.

1089
01:38:16,270 --> 01:38:19,857
Camera 3 on my hands.
Camera 4 on my orchestra.

1090
01:38:19,941 --> 01:38:23,444
- Camera 5 on my audience. Clear?
- Clear and sound.

1091
01:38:23,569 --> 01:38:27,073
Camera 1 test.
Camera 2 test. Camera 3?

1092
01:38:27,198 --> 01:38:28,825
Ok with 3.

1093
01:38:36,999 --> 01:38:39,210
- Honestly incomprehensible.
- So strange

1094
01:38:39,710 --> 01:38:41,420
Absurd

1095
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,048
No, I don't understand

1096
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:46,968
Concerto for violin and
orchestra in D major

1097
01:38:47,051 --> 01:38:49,846
It's opera 35 by cajkovskij.

1098
01:38:49,929 --> 01:38:53,975
It was written in 1878
in Clarens, close to Geneve

1099
01:38:54,058 --> 01:38:55,768
in collaboration with
violinist Joseph Kotek,

1100
01:38:55,893 --> 01:38:58,980
who gave him suggestions on the
execution of the concerto.

1101
01:38:59,063 --> 01:39:01,023
He should also have been the first
solo violin....

1102
01:39:25,214 --> 01:39:27,592
I can't work this way.
They will ruin my reputation

1103
01:39:27,675 --> 01:39:30,219
It's my bar, they are my clients.
I am the only one to sell

1104
01:39:30,344 --> 01:39:34,390
But try to understand. It's the third
time I call you

1105
01:39:37,351 --> 01:39:41,189
There is also the leaflet included
Yes, 300 euro.

1106
01:39:41,314 --> 01:39:44,317
Spasibo. Spasibo bolshoi.

1107
01:39:53,326 --> 01:39:54,702
They are here.

1108
01:40:05,296 --> 01:40:07,256
Run!

1109
01:40:08,174 --> 01:40:09,425
this way, this way!

1110
01:41:40,391 --> 01:41:42,018
where are them?

1111
01:42:53,965 --> 01:42:56,092
this way, this way!

1112
01:42:58,052 --> 01:43:00,847
Gavrilov! Open up!

1113
01:43:48,644 --> 01:43:52,231
If you are up there, please prove it to me
This is the moment.

1114
01:43:52,356 --> 01:43:54,650
Do the miracle, give me a proof

1115
01:46:29,180 --> 01:46:32,767
I would never have guessed!
You really do exist!

1116
01:46:44,070 --> 01:46:47,406
Anne marie,
I have not told you all

1117
01:46:48,115 --> 01:46:52,578
Because of the interview with Radio
Free Europe, Lea and Yitzhak,

1118
01:46:52,703 --> 01:46:58,709
were arrested by KGB. They had a
six months old baby

1119
01:46:59,710 --> 01:47:04,340
Seeing KGB about to arrive, they gave
the baby to a neighbour

1120
01:47:04,423 --> 01:47:07,093
- Bring her to France
- Who gave us

1121
01:47:07,176 --> 01:47:09,303
Bring to France. Please.

1122
01:47:09,387 --> 01:47:14,100
What was destiny of girl, daughter of
jewish, enemy of the state

1123
01:47:14,183 --> 01:47:17,103
condemned to lifetime gulag?

1124
01:47:17,854 --> 01:47:22,108
Irina, Sacha and me sent her
to France

1125
01:47:22,191 --> 01:47:27,697
with a friend, a theather agent
who was in Moscow

1126
01:48:19,582 --> 01:48:23,085
Lea and Yitzhak were
deported in Siberia

1127
01:48:23,377 --> 01:48:27,924
Until the end of her life,
Lea played in her mind

1128
01:48:28,007 --> 01:48:33,429
concerto by cajkovskij.
they call her... the crazy.

1129
01:48:35,014 --> 01:48:39,727
she died of cold and hunger in 1981

1130
01:48:41,354 --> 01:48:44,857
Yitzhak died of sorrow
six months after

1131
01:48:49,445 --> 01:48:54,867
Cajkovskij...
violin concerto.

1132
01:48:56,786 --> 01:49:02,458
I dragged Lea in her folly

1133
01:49:27,608 --> 01:49:31,445
Lea was your mother

1134
01:50:36,302 --> 01:50:39,639
Enemy of the state

1135
01:50:40,014 --> 01:50:41,974
Down the curtain

1136
01:50:43,851 --> 01:50:47,438
Forgive me

1137
01:52:03,181 --> 01:52:08,144
Mum, there is daddy in tv.
He is playing in Paris!

1138
01:52:08,144 --> 01:52:09,854
Sacha...
in Paris?

1139
01:52:22,950 --> 01:52:27,246
Orchestra Andrel Filipov
5 additional shows

1140
01:55:51,909 --> 01:55:53,286
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

1141
01:56:41,292 --> 01:56:42,835
Bravo!
