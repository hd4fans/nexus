1880年代末起
since the late 1880s

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,461
视觉艺术家和讲故事的人
visual artist and story-tellers

4
00:00:43,462 --> 00:00:46,990
开始使用活动影像来创造神奇的世界
have used moving images to create amazing worlds

5
00:00:49,832 --> 00:00:51,690
电影给我们启示
movies have inspired us

6
00:00:53,908 --> 00:00:56,973
激励我们并捕获我们的想象
thrilled us and capture our imaginations

7
00:00:58,254 --> 00:01:02,248
胶片，曾帮助我们分享经验和梦想
film, has helped us to share our experiences and dreams

8
00:01:05,196 --> 00:01:08,168
100年来，化学胶片曾经是
photo chemical film, has been the exclusive format

9
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:13,180
捕获、冲显、放映和储存动态影像
capture, develop, project and store moving images

10
00:01:13,181 --> 00:01:15,088
的唯一格式
for over 100 years

11
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,683
近些年才发展起一种新技术
it was only resently that a new technology had immerged

12
00:01:24,699 --> 00:01:29,575
正挑战着胶片所代表的影像质量和工作流程的黄金地位
that challenging film place of gold standards for quality and workflow

13
00:01:30,685 --> 00:01:33,611
数字技术已经进化到可以替代胶片
digital technology is evolving to a point that

14
00:01:33,612 --> 00:01:36,444
执行最主要的任务：
means very well replace film as the prirary mean

15
00:01:36,445 --> 00:01:40,066
创造和分享动态影像
of creating and sharing motion pictures

16
00:01:40,573 --> 00:01:43,451
这部记录作品叫《side by side》
the documentary doing is called <i>side by side<i>

17
00:01:43,756 --> 00:01:48,493
涉及到数字电影的科学、艺术和影响
it's the documentary about science, art and impact of digital cinema

18
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:51,583
一百年的化学胶片发展
100 years of photo chemical film making

19
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:56,436
目前已经到达了一个临界状态
right now it reached a kind of threshold of tipping point

20
00:01:57,114 --> 00:02:01,492
这场对话，这个时间点
in this conversaton, in this intersection of time

21
00:02:01,493 --> 00:02:02,607
是历史性的
is historic

22
00:02:02,686 --> 00:02:05,612
我们怕是已经来到了
we've kind of come to this place where

23
00:02:05,613 --> 00:02:08,677
胶片的末日
it is the end of film

24
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,928
我们今在何方
where are we today

25
00:02:11,201 --> 00:02:15,287
这很令人兴奋，因为这是重新创造的新媒介
it's exciting, because it's a re-invention of new medium

26
00:02:16,755 --> 00:02:21,028
如果化学摄影法可以承载我们文化中的美德
if the photo chemical process has virtues through our culture

27
00:02:22,326 --> 00:02:23,766
另一形式有何不可？
why aren't you another level

28
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,295
关键是你怎么用它讲故事
how do you use it to tell a story

29
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,541
怎么用它去描绘一个场景
how do you use it to paint apicture

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,439
您算和胶片一刀两断了吗？
are you done with film

31
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:33,575
不要故意带我，基努
don’t hold me to it, Keanu

32
00:02:33,578 --> 00:02:34,922
不过
but…

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,399
我想是的
I think I am

34
00:02:37,918 --> 00:02:43,305
数字摄影机是电影业的新美学手段
digital cameras are the new aesthetic that coming to cinema

35
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,422
同时我们又哀悼胶片的衰落
and at the same time we are going to mourn the loss of film

36
00:02:49,781 --> 00:02:53,636
我清楚知道在哪、为什么要用胶片拍电影
I am costly(?) to justify where and why I shoot a film by film

37
00:02:53,909 --> 00:03:00,579
不过实话说我没听说过谁知道为啥一定要用数字拍电影
But I don’t hear anybody being honestly to justify why they want to shoot a film digitally

38
00:03:00,746 --> 00:03:04,322
我希望我所想象的一切都能真实展示
I want everything I could imagine to be something we can realize

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,690
不过胶片很难实现这一点
I saw the door opening on a field of possibility that you just couldn’t do it with film

40
00:03:10,622 --> 00:03:13,269
如今比较悲哀的是
It’s really sad right now

41
00:03:13,316 --> 00:03:18,099
摄影开始批量使用数码技术
to see cameras cording imagery a serial way

42
00:03:18,595 --> 00:03:21,195
取代胶片
starting to take over film

43
00:03:21,195 --> 00:03:25,111
{\a6}胶片拍摄

44
00:03:21,396 --> 00:03:25,111
我才不要把油画换成蜡笔画（画面质感）
I’m not gonna trade my oil paintings to seta crayons

45
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,600
{\a6}数字拍摄

46
00:03:28,267 --> 00:03:31,750
有人看好数字技术
there will be people who will chip in digital

47
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:36,023
也有人不仅想杀掉这只生金蛋的鹅
there will be people who will not only kill the goose lay the golden egg

48
00:03:36,024 --> 00:03:39,297
还要在之前把它搞的一团糟
they’ll sort of mess it first

49
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:41,620
如果数字技术取代胶片
if the intention of that digital will replace film

50
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:45,871
恰恰是因为我们所讨厌它的一些方面，那很悲哀
I’ll be sad if it's doing acturally exactly where we hate it

51
00:03:48,915 --> 00:03:53,838
因为数字能够做的胶片效果胶片自然可以做到更好
because that digital now can make it look like film that film is inherently better

52
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:55,768
就因为我们喜欢这种更好的感觉
just we like the way it looks better

53
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:58,555
（就否定数字技术）这有点专断
which seems kind of arbitrary that we were used to

54
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,983
胶片是19世纪的发明
film is a 19th century invention

55
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:04,559
我们已经到达了化学照相法的顶峰
we are on the top of photo chemical process

56
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,278
很难再有进步
this is about as far as ever we can go

57
00:04:06,827 --> 00:04:08,591
数字技术发展至今
digital is here now

58
00:04:08,705 --> 00:04:09,820
还有很长的路要走
but it’s gonna keep going

59
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:11,619
你会是数字发展的参与者
and you’re gonna be part of that

60
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,801
参与者将决定数字技术的未来
who’s be gonna be a part of that dictating where that goes

61
00:04:14,453 --> 00:04:15,885
我觉得胶片不会怎样
I don’t think films going anywhere

62
00:04:15,886 --> 00:04:20,948
我觉得完全摒弃胶片无论对人还是影片画面都不能
I don’t think it’s to the image or anybody to totally eliminate film

63
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:23,177
会有很多人加入我们，为胶片而战
there gonna be many of us, they’ll fight for film

64
00:04:23,272 --> 00:04:25,223
为在感光剂上摄影的经验而战
fight for the experience of shooting on emulsion

65
00:04:26,871 --> 00:04:30,865
我们处于某种变革的迷雾中
we really are in the mist of some sort of revolution

66
00:04:30,866 --> 00:04:33,698
这种变革威胁到影片的基本质量
that threatens the status qual

67
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:38,017
所以这既是可怕的又是自由的
it’s so potentially either scary thing or very liberating thing

68
00:04:38,334 --> 00:04:45,718
阴阳相成

69
00:04:52,647 --> 00:04:55,241
电影制作第一步：
one of the first steps of production process

70
00:04:55,242 --> 00:04:58,802
捕获影像
is capturing the images in camera

71
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:03,711
导演、演员、摄像师和全体制作组
the director, actors, cinematographer and the entire production team

72
00:05:03,712 --> 00:05:06,173
共同努力把剧本变活
work together to bring the script to life

73
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:12,034
摄像技师，也叫摄影指导或DP
the cinematographer, also called the director of photography or DP

74
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:15,162
帮助导演达成电影的影像效果
helps the director achieve the look of the movie

75
00:05:16,178 --> 00:05:19,615
DP的职责在于决定摄影装备
the DP is responsible for knowing what equipment is needed

76
00:05:19,616 --> 00:05:22,726
以及了解其摄影原理
and how it works in order to capture the scenes

77
00:05:28,103 --> 00:05:33,085
摄影指导要注意颜色和构图
a director of photography looks at color and composition

78
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:35,862
{\a6}大卫 芬奇 导演
（社交网络/搏击会/七宗罪）

79
00:05:33,086 --> 00:05:38,148
以及角度和其它构成电影的元素
and angles and all those things in terms of how the movie is being built

80
00:05:38,515 --> 00:05:41,255
光照到皮肤的效果，光穿过头发的效果
the quality of light of skin, the quality of light through hair,

81
00:05:41,256 --> 00:05:44,367
光透过窗户再从地板反射的效果
the quality of light through the window and bouncing off the floor

82
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:48,734
这些都要等同真实世界的构造
they’re equating the building of this world

83
00:05:48,821 --> 00:05:51,890
和真实世界的
and terms of energy

84
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:54,773
能量反射效果
that reflects off objects

85
00:05:54,774 --> 00:05:58,581
问题是
the question is about

86
00:05:58,582 --> 00:06:02,028
构图，情感，怎么去让人感觉
framing, sensibility, how to make people feel

87
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:05,028
{\a6}迈克尔 查普曼，摄影
（出租车司机/愤怒的公牛/粗野少年）

88
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:04,769
把情绪付诸光线
bringing emotion into the lights

89
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,884
基于要恰当的处理光线
comes from being appropriate and somehow being

90
00:06:06,885 --> 00:06:09,670
不过最棒的是要高于“恰当”
the really great is, more than appropriate

91
00:06:09,671 --> 00:06:11,946
真正让人惊奇的是
they really startle you with how wonderfully

92
00:06:11,946 --> 00:06:14,871
我能如何漂亮的展现所有动作
I could have this look is on whatever they’re doing

93
00:06:11,964 --> 00:06:14,871
{\a6}出租车司机，1976

94
00:06:15,596 --> 00:06:20,797
这种专业技术水平上
That level of crossmanship? or technical expertise

95
00:06:17,596 --> 00:06:20,670
{\a6}约翰 马西森，摄影
（角斗士/浪人47/X战警：第一战）

96
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:22,422
你没法解释自己要做什么
You can’t explain what you’re gonna do

97
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:25,441
所以他们必须把你当回事
so there is a certain matter of leap of faith that they have to having you

98
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,100
{\a6}现代启示录，1979

99
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:33,670
{\a6}维托里奥 斯托拉罗，摄影
（现代启示录/末代皇帝/小活佛）

100
00:06:28,332 --> 00:06:30,515
作为摄影师
To be a cinematographer

101
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:33,859
要有艺术方面的知识
is to have the knowledge of the art

102
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:40,500
毫无疑问，电影是一种利用科技实现的综合艺术
Without any doubt, cinema today is a mix of art in technology

103
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,670
{\a6}大卫 斯坦普，视觉特效
（X战警，X战警2，火星人玩转地球）

104
00:06:40,592 --> 00:06:44,121
如今在这个领域还要懂点技术才行
Today, in this area, you also have to be a bit of technician

105
00:06:44,122 --> 00:06:45,514
你得懂设备
You have to know the equipment

106
00:06:45,514 --> 00:06:51,598
明白成像流程的所有环节对DP来说非常重要
It’s really important for DP to understand the entire links of the image chain

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,499
从获取到开掘
From acquisition to excavation

108
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,761
摄像机是测量光子并使其聚焦
The camera is a tool that focuses and measures

109
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,594
并以图片形式将其记录的工具
Photons of light and record them in images

110
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,835
通过胶片摄像机
With a film camera

111
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:19,922
光透过镜头并照射到电影胶片上
Light enter through the lens and hits the frame film behind the lens

112
00:07:21,836 --> 00:07:26,758
胶片表面覆有含卤化银晶体颗粒的乳剂
The film is covered emulsion that contain grains of silver halides crystals

113
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:30,573
这些晶体在光照下会发生化学反应
These crystals react chemically when light hits them

114
00:07:30,745 --> 00:07:34,102
显影时晶体会转化为金属银
And the crystal change to silver metal when they are developed

115
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:38,127
这样拍摄的影像就在胶片上形成了
A photograph image is formed on the film

116
00:07:40,102 --> 00:07:43,102
{\a6}瑞德 穆拉诺，摄影
（冰冻之河/小小鸟/为了艾伦）

117
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,851
对于胶片的质感和颗粒感
There is something about the texture of the grain structure of film

118
00:07:44,852 --> 00:07:51,260
我个人会调整直到觉得舒服
That personally I hold on till it’s like a comforting thing to me

119
00:07:51,312 --> 00:07:53,912
这种感觉更像是可触的
And it feels more tangible

120
00:07:54,751 --> 00:07:58,280
我打开并轻击它们的时候很有质感
How I open up and flip themselves give sort of touch of quality

121
00:07:59,102 --> 00:08:02,102
{\a6}布拉德福德 杨，摄影
（作品都是没听过的独立制作，就不翻了…）

122
00:07:58,524 --> 00:08:01,403
这种图片的颗粒感
Still have some granularity in the image that

123
00:08:01,404 --> 00:08:04,375
可以让强光生动
keeps high light living and keeps blacks

124
00:08:04,376 --> 00:08:06,000
并赋予暗光更多微妙特性
with a little bit more nuance characters in them

125
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,400
{\a6}迪克 蒲伯，摄影
（秘密与谎言/魔术师/无忧无虑）

126
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,065
我热爱颗粒感和纹理
I greaten grain and texture

127
00:08:09,065 --> 00:08:13,012
它们能给你多种多样的选择
they give you a variety of different opportunities

128
00:08:09,065 --> 00:08:12,065
{\a6}魔术师，2006

129
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,833
胶片拍摄的基本流程
The workflow on the film set

130
00:08:15,834 --> 00:08:20,338
就是你要带上几千尺的胶片
Basically means that you take thousand-foot load of film

131
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:22,567
装到胶卷盒里
loaded in to the magazines

132
00:08:22,617 --> 00:08:28,283
每卷也就够你拍个10分钟多点
And that enable you to shoot for roughly 10+ minutes per roll of film

133
00:08:31,103 --> 00:08:34,122
接着是休息时间
And it gives a natural break of action

134
00:08:34,123 --> 00:08:36,722
这时候有人把拍满的胶卷拽出来
when someone pulls the magazine off the camera

135
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,486
再把新胶卷放进去
And put a new magazine on

136
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:44,064
接着这些胶片会被送到胶片实验室
Then the film goes away to the film lab

137
00:08:45,069 --> 00:08:47,623
过夜显影
And it developed over night

138
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,853
然后冲印
And printed

139
00:08:56,428 --> 00:08:59,121
第二天样片出炉
And in the next day, you could see dailys

140
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,554
有好多年这都是一件乐事
There was a joy for many many years

141
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:07,889
{\a6}珊迪 希瑟，摄影
（拜见布朗一家/早安孟买/阶梯下的恶魔）

142
00:09:04,555 --> 00:09:08,640
因为我们是片场幽灵
For us to be the genes on set

143
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:10,544
所以我们热爱样片
That’s why we like dailys

144
00:09:10,545 --> 00:09:13,842
我们都去表演，我们喜欢这样
We’d all go, we’d act, we’d like

145
00:09:13,843 --> 00:09:15,746
我们爱干嘛干嘛，也喜欢我们干的事
We’d do all we do, and we’d love what we did

146
00:09:15,747 --> 00:09:17,464
接着每个人都入了迷
and then everybody would rapt

147
00:09:17,465 --> 00:09:19,647
然后第二天一早我们回实验室的时候
and the next morning we came back in the lab

148
00:09:19,648 --> 00:09:21,736
我们都惊呼：看看我们都干了些什么
We went “wow, look what we got.”

149
00:09:21,737 --> 00:09:22,873
这真是神奇
You know it was magic

150
00:09:23,746 --> 00:09:26,746
{\a6}唐纳 麦卡派恩，摄影
（金刚狼/红磨坊/铁血战士）

151
00:09:22,874 --> 00:09:25,427
摄影指导是魔术师
The director of photography was a magician

152
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:29,963
他是唯一真正可能知道
He was the only? one who actually, probably knew

153
00:09:29,964 --> 00:09:32,192
第二天样片会怎么样的人
what’s gonna beyond the screen the next day

154
00:09:32,457 --> 00:09:35,754
这给了你不少权利和伙伴
And this gets you a lot of authority and pal

155
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:40,079
拍摄的时候你得有种鉴定的信念
There is a certain believe of faith you take when you shoot the film

156
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,365
这很浪漫的
And there are something really romantic about that

157
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:46,591
样片回来每个人都兴冲冲想看看你拍了些什么
Get your dailys back and everyone being really excited to see what you got

158
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:51,059
我不喜欢被样片背叛
I don’t like the betrayal of dailys

159
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:57,049
我不喜欢去全神贯注的看表演时候
I don’t like going in and seeing and getting swept up with the performance

160
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:00,950
在25尺的屏幕上发现拍摄失焦了
And then seeing go out focus on 25-foot screen

161
00:10:00,951 --> 00:10:04,387
而且还知道这重来不了
and knowing that there’s no way to retrieve that

162
00:10:04,387 --> 00:10:08,387
{\a6}罗伯特 罗德里格兹，导演/摄影
（罪恶之城/非常小特务/墨西哥往事）

163
00:10:04,388 --> 00:10:06,466
拍电影的时候有种感觉
But in like a film about that feeling

164
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:09,020
过了半天一天
midway to the day, end of the day

165
00:10:09,021 --> 00:10:11,203
真的拍了什么东西吗？我想不起来我拍了点啥
did we get anything, that day? I didn’t remember, I didn’t get it

166
00:10:11,302 --> 00:10:13,577
因为你看不见所以没有拍过的痕迹
Didn’t feel we put the flag in it cause you couldn’t see

167
00:10:13,578 --> 00:10:15,249
就像关了灯画画
it’s like painting with the lights off

168
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:16,782
但是DP会告诉你：
But the DP will tell you: 

169
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,568
没啊，灯没关，都在我脑子里呢
it’s not, the lights aren’t off, it’s in my head

170
00:10:19,864 --> 00:10:21,304
在他脑子里，这不错
It’s in his head, well that’s great

171
00:10:21,305 --> 00:10:22,836
但扛摄像机的不是我
but I’m off bringing the camera

172
00:10:22,837 --> 00:10:25,576
选镜头的也不是我，我就管表演怎么样
picking the lenses, I’m judging the performances

173
00:10:27,602 --> 00:10:30,435
数位摄像机不使用胶片
A digital camera does not use film

174
00:10:30,531 --> 00:10:35,175
相对的，镜头后是电子传感器或芯片
Instead, it has an electronic sensor or chip behind the lens

175
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,900
传感器由许多微小的图像元素构成
The sensor, is made up with millions of tiny picture elements

176
00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:41,860
或简称像素
or pixels for short

177
00:10:42,825 --> 00:10:44,451
当光进入摄像机的时候
when light enters the camera

178
00:10:44,452 --> 00:10:49,000
击打像素并产生各自独立的电子电荷
it hit the pixels and create individual electronic charges

179
00:10:49,267 --> 00:10:54,700
这些电荷被放大后转化为代表图像的数位信息
these charges are magnifying converted into digital data that represent the image

180
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,900
{\a6}大卫 塔特肖，摄影
（星球大战1-3/极速赛车手/绿里奇迹）

181
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:58,751
用胶片拍摄由于它一直在转
ring the film that it just constantly moving

182
00:10:58,752 --> 00:11:01,689
所以总有点模糊
So the result is kind of fuzziness

183
00:11:03,452 --> 00:11:05,821
而像素这样的东西
well the pixel kind

184
00:11:05,822 --> 00:11:11,301
是非常细致精确的
is very fine-line, accurate, exact thing

185
00:11:18,307 --> 00:11:20,443
用带显示器的数位摄像机
with digital cameras in monitors

186
00:11:20,444 --> 00:11:24,715
你能在拍摄的同时观看拍下的东西
you are able to see exactly what you are recording on sight as you’re shooting

187
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:27,991
不同于胶片摄像机
unlike film cameras

188
00:11:27,992 --> 00:11:30,731
你不用等上一天才能看自己拍了些什么
you don’t have to wait a day to see what you’ve captured

189
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:32,715
样片不再是“隔天的”
they’re no longer dailys

190
00:11:33,186 --> 00:11:35,369
而是“即取的”
they are “immediatelys”

191
00:11:37,443 --> 00:11:40,443
{\a6}费尔 麦休克斯
（皇家赌场/佐罗传奇/蓝精灵）

192
00:11:35,749 --> 00:11:38,536
你坐在片场或帐篷什么的地方
You sit round back of the set or in the tent somewhere

193
00:11:38,537 --> 00:11:40,254
看着巨型显示器
looking at the huge monitor

194
00:11:40,254 --> 00:11:41,635
然后通过这个作调整
and make adjustment from that

195
00:11:41,636 --> 00:11:42,843
这和现场调整没什么两样
which is actually quite alike

196
00:11:42,844 --> 00:11:45,629
因为你看到画面就是现场
because that means you seeing the picture exactly it is

197
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,722
用胶片的话，一个拍摄
And with old film, a capture

198
00:11:47,723 --> 00:11:49,998
要过夜才能看，而且有时会担心
it was overnight and sometime you got the burden

199
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:51,438
我是不是拍的没问题
that “I wonder if I go there right”

200
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:55,710
(?)我认为不管样片有多好都得有个后备措施
(?)I think we need more backine and don’t worry how great daily is

201
00:11:52,843 --> 00:11:55,843
{\a6}乔治 卢卡斯，导演/制片人
（星球大战1-4/500年后/美国风情画）

202
00:11:56,394 --> 00:11:59,041
谁都知道看样片怎么回事
They know as well as anybody that you go to dailys

203
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:01,409
不过我真觉得应该有更多后备措施
and I really think there should be more backline in there

204
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,896
你要是在片场干过
But If you do it on the set

205
00:12:02,897 --> 00:12:05,310
就知道后备措施的重要性了
You can understand it, more backlines

206
00:12:06,363 --> 00:12:08,732
（数位摄像）实现了这点，这很好，就是我想要的
And they do it, it’s ok cause that is exactly what I want

207
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:11,054
因为在电影院放出来也是这样
cause it exactly is the way could be in the movie theater

208
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,525
人们都这么说：
People speak about:

209
00:12:12,526 --> 00:12:14,382
谢天谢地，我能看见我正在拍的东西
thank god, I can see what I’m getting on

210
00:12:14,383 --> 00:12:16,147
我不用等到明天早上了
I don’t have to wait until tomorrow

211
00:12:16,148 --> 00:12:18,655
我能更专注，我知道我在拍什么
I can see it and focus on it I know what I’m getting

212
00:12:19,732 --> 00:12:22,732
{\a6}克里斯托弗 诺兰，导演
（黑暗骑士/盗梦空间/记忆碎片）

213
00:12:18,723 --> 00:12:20,581
在片场看显示器
few watching the monitor on set

214
00:12:20,582 --> 00:12:23,197
你觉得你真的看到你拍的东西了
and you feel that you really seeing what you’ve got

215
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:24,544
其实这种想法欺骗了你
this thinking is fooling yourself

216
00:12:24,545 --> 00:12:29,560
你的观众是要在1000倍大的屏幕上看这些东西
Your audience are gonna watch the film on the screen is 1000 times bigger

217
00:12:29,561 --> 00:12:31,371
你只是在大电视上看
you watch it on large TV

218
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:35,310
没错，你能看见自己拍了什么，就在那
Yes, you see what you get it, that’s right there

219
00:12:36,227 --> 00:12:39,227
{\a6}马丁 斯科塞斯，导演
纽约黑帮/出租车司/机好家伙

220
00:12:36,227 --> 00:12:39,013
我的经验建议之后再看拍的东西
Proof for me that I think you need to see rushes later

221
00:12:39,527 --> 00:12:41,756
我认为这是集中精力的方法
I think it’s concentrate

222
00:12:42,073 --> 00:12:45,097
表演或仅仅是动作
But the performances or just the movement

223
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,977
你可以在特定的时间去看
that is something you can see in a special time

224
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:54,502
摄制电影的过程是摄影指导的技术和秘密
The process of shooting film was the DP’s art and secret

225
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,560
{\a6}查理 何兹费得，特艺彩色纽约市场部高级副总裁

226
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:58,810
现在摄影师只是数位摄影前面的显示器
Today the cinematographer is a monitor on the digital shoot

227
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:04,800
他们拍什么都能被看见，并任人评判
and everything they are doing could seen, criticized and questioned

228
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,748
有时这挺让人分心的
It’s very distractive sometimes

229
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,800
{\a6}乔 舒马赫，导演
（永远的蝙蝠侠/电话亭/粗野少年）

230
00:13:07,749 --> 00:13:10,117
我和几个演员一起工作
I work with a couple of actors

231
00:13:10,118 --> 00:13:14,795
每天坚持和其中某一个看（样片）
that insist on I’m look at it everyday with one of the actors

232
00:13:14,796 --> 00:13:16,421
我可以边看边说
I was able to talk among of it

233
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:18,929
因为这能让他的表演变得非常自信
because it’s making his performances very self-conscious

234
00:13:18,976 --> 00:13:19,858
是吗？
Right?

235
00:13:19,859 --> 00:13:23,999
你是不是听说他们都只看他们的头发而已？
Are you also convinced that everybody is just looking at their hair?

236
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:28,458
作为摄影师最大乐趣之一
One of the great pleasure that being a cameraman was

237
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:32,136
那些尊崇制片人意愿的人
that the people who was the suits on the producer

238
00:13:32,137 --> 00:13:33,214
他们都觉得自己知道怎么表演
They all think they know how to act

239
00:13:33,215 --> 00:13:34,458
他们都觉得自己知道怎么写剧本
they all think they know how to write

240
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:35,572
他们都觉得自己知道怎么导演
they all think they know how to direct

241
00:13:35,573 --> 00:13:37,254
但是他们都知道自己不会摄像
But they knew they didn’t knew how to shoot

242
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,880
这完全取决于你
So I say this is really got on you

243
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:41,412
你可以说：看吧，这片子是你做的
you could say: here, this the media you do it

244
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:42,797
我才是魔术师
I was the charmer

245
00:13:43,219 --> 00:13:47,306
不过现在会摄像是另一码事了
But now, being a thing that you can shoot is not like it used to be

246
00:13:47,518 --> 00:13:52,115
有些摄像师之所以当摄像师
There’re cinematographers who became cinematographers

247
00:13:52,301 --> 00:13:55,691
是因为他们热爱摄像的魔力
because they love the voodoo of it

248
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,229
他们喜欢导演对他们说：
They love it when the director said to them:

249
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,715
“那个角落
“down that cornor”

250
00:13:59,716 --> 00:14:03,058
你能看见吗？好像要消失了”
will you able to that? that’s kind of melt away”

251
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:05,879
他们倒是机灵：“明天看嘛，肯定超惊喜，包你满意”
they get to guile: “ just wait till tomorrow, it’s gonna be amazing, you’re gonna love it.”

252
00:14:05,999 --> 00:14:08,999
{\a6}七宗罪，1995

253
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:11,396
接下来，我经历过的，他们把样片搞定了，我就会…
and then, I had this experience, they’ve set the dailys then I’ve gone 

254
00:14:11,397 --> 00:14:14,934
比如《七宗罪》里有些令人兴奋的东西就是表现不出来
some of the durance can’t just work on <i>se7en<i> you just go "wow"

255
00:14:15,385 --> 00:14:20,000
不过倒是有个差不多的人在，所以你就会
but there is the an equal man on time so you go:

256
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,673
看着它说：“这他妈怎么回事？”
look at it and say: “what the fuck?”

257
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,325
现在有了数位摄像机
Now with digital cameras

258
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:32,248
人人都能看见拍摄的结果
everyone could see exactly what things were going to look like

259
00:14:32,249 --> 00:14:33,791
这改变了你从前对摄像的喜爱方式
that changes the way you like it

260
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,554
甚至改变了你的表演
it may even change your performance

261
00:14:36,555 --> 00:14:39,015
因为这给拍电影带来了完全不同的感受
Because it creates a different feelings in the whole thing

262
00:14:39,255 --> 00:14:42,042
这让我们的创造性有了更多空间
It gives us more scope to be creative

263
00:14:42,043 --> 00:14:43,156
这点令人兴奋
That was exciting

（街头霸王：春丽传/变异编年史/黑暗乡村）

265
00:14:43,188 --> 00:14:46,671
对我来说这就是数位摄像机革命的全部

乔治史密斯和威乐鲍尔
George Smith and Willard Boyle

269
00:14:54,688 --> 00:14:57,520
提出电荷藕合装置（CCD）构想
came up with the idea for the charged couple device

270
00:14:54,688 --> 00:14:57,520
{\a6}<i>两位老爷子因此获得2009年诺贝尔物理学奖<i>

271
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:01,328
并发明了第一个CCD芯片
and the first CCD chip was created

272
00:15:02,142 --> 00:15:05,625
<i>CCD的特点之一是<i>
<i>One of the things that makes the CCD unique<i>

273
00:15:05,626 --> 00:15:09,665
<i>它可以执行某些特殊功能<i>
<i>is its ability to performs specialized functions<i>

274
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:12,359
<i>例如当摄像机用<i>
<i>such as acting as a camera<i>

275
00:15:12,558 --> 00:15:16,134
<i>你所看到的我们在电视上的图像<i>

<i>就是在我们前方的这个小CCD摄像机拍摄的<i>
<i>is being produced by the small CCD camera which is directly in front of us here<i>

277
00:15:21,137 --> 00:15:25,274
70年代早期，在参观贝尔实验室后
In the early 1970s, after a visit to bell labs

278
00:15:25,275 --> 00:15:30,843
索尼公司开始应用CCD技术推广并发展新产品
SONY started investing in and developing products using the CCD technology

279
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:35,419
盛田昭夫是索尼之父
Akio Morita was the father of SONY

280
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,625
{\a6}阿列克 沙匹罗，索尼市场部高级副总裁

281
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,608
他是好莱坞的拥簇
He was always an amor of Hollywood

282
00:15:37,609 --> 00:15:42,391
而设计电子摄像机是他的梦想
And it was his dream to design an electronic camera

283
00:15:42,391 --> 00:15:48,428
能创造和35mm胶片同等或更佳质量的图像
That could create images were equaling or better than the 35mm film

284
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,211
<i>广告：随时随地，想拍就拍<i>
<i>record what you want , when you want<i>

80年代中期
In the mid of 1980s

286
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:57,109
索尼生产了第一批消费型CCD便携式摄像机
SONY was producing its first consumer quality CCD camcorders

287
00:15:57,109 --> 00:16:00,109
{\a6}哥本哈根，丹麦

288
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,117
90年代
In the 1990s

289
00:16:01,118 --> 00:16:05,436
小型标清摄像机开始用于数位拍摄
small standard definition cameras began recording digitally

290
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:09,644
它们开始用于电影拍摄
They were first to use cinematically

291
00:16:09,645 --> 00:16:14,123
始于在丹麦兴起的“道格玛95”运动
when they were embraced by the dogma 95 movement in Denmark

292
00:16:14,243 --> 00:16:15,822
您能不能谈谈
Can you speak a little bit about

293
00:16:15,823 --> 00:16:19,165
您是什么时候开始使用数位…
Where did you first coming to digital…

294
00:16:19,165 --> 00:16:22,165
{\a6}拉斯 冯 提尔，导演
（抑郁症/反基督者/黑暗中的舞者）

295
00:16:19,165 --> 00:16:22,834
实际上是偶然
Actually it’s by chance

296
00:16:22,835 --> 00:16:26,596
因为我们搞了个“道格玛95”
Because we made this thing called dogma 95

297
00:16:27,088 --> 00:16:29,828
而且制定了一些规则
And we made up some rules

298
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:31,576
其中一条是
And one of them was that

299
00:16:31,577 --> 00:16:36,300
必须使用35mm拍摄
the thing has to be filmed by academy 35mm

300
00:16:36,594 --> 00:16:37,755
接着另一条又说
And on e of them said

301
00:16:37,756 --> 00:16:40,541
必须是手持摄像机
it had to be hand-held camera also

302
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,494
然后我提议，既然如此
And then I said, if that is the case

303
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,841
我们也能用录像
we can also use video

304
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:50,400
那时候又正好这些摄像机问世了
And that was just at the same time that these cameras came to appear

305
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:54,584
安东尼 多德 曼妥是第一个拍摄“道格玛95”的DP
Anthony Dod Mantle was the DP who shot the first dogma film

306
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,507
由托马斯 温特伯格执导的《家宴》
Thomas Winterberg‘s  <i>celebration<i>

307
00:16:57,907 --> 00:17:03,712
(?)用数位拍摄还能保证电影的纯粹性吗？
(?)Was it pure also of digital video？

308
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,925
摄像机比较轻，这么点重量不足以…
The lightness of the camera, the weight that you couldn’t…

309
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:09,154
我第一次用这个是这样的：
I tell you it was the first hit me

310
00:17:09,155 --> 00:17:11,430
我去哥本哈根的农贸市场
I was coming up the food market in Copenhagen

311
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,430
{\a6}安东尼 多德 曼妥，摄影
 （家宴/惊变28天/贫民窟的百万富翁）

312
00:17:11,618 --> 00:17:16,355
我有台索尼PC3，就是我拍《家宴》的那一台
I had a SONY PC 3 and that’s the exact camera I end shooting <i>celebration<i>

313
00:17:16,356 --> 00:17:20,813
我记起生机勃勃的拥挤场景
and I remember scenes crowd with lives

314
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:25,568
假设我们穿过这样工业化背景的地方
Supported us just moving across this field with a industrial backdrop

315
00:17:25,607 --> 00:17:28,161
有雾，模糊，这种感觉很哥特
Into mist and hazing, it’s gothic

316
00:17:29,714 --> 00:17:31,432
我才开始学习怎么用它
I was just learning how to play with it

317
00:17:31,433 --> 00:17:36,076
到处拍，对这小东西有种怪怪的感觉
Swept it around and I got this weird moment of this midgetcy

318
00:17:36,544 --> 00:17:38,680
又轻又小
Of lightness and midgetcy

319
00:17:38,681 --> 00:17:40,585
而当我看到画面时又颇感震惊
and I looked at the image and said “my god”

320
00:17:40,586 --> 00:17:42,814
这可以是很好的摄像机
and that’s gonna be nice cameras

321
00:17:42,915 --> 00:17:44,308
我认为
I called that

322
00:17:44,318 --> 00:17:47,318
{\a6}家宴，1998

323
00:17:47,755 --> 00:17:50,820
用微型摄像机拍摄《家宴》有很多话可说
Too much say when I was shooting in <i>celebration<i> on the small cameras

324
00:17:50,887 --> 00:17:53,024
因为我想成为《家宴》的主角
Casuse I want to be a protagonist on <i>celebration<i>

325
00:17:56,778 --> 00:18:00,725
电影的构成实际上就是摄像机充满情绪化的移动
The combination of the movie is actually emotional movements of the camera

326
00:18:00,742 --> 00:18:04,204
这决定了电影的视角
which probably defined that film’s visual line

327
00:18:04,205 --> 00:18:05,622
应该把它与演员的表演
should depart them from the actors

328
00:18:05,623 --> 00:18:07,062
和剧本的指导分离开
and the watching great script

329
00:18:14,411 --> 00:18:17,615
用这台摄像机，这些问题迎刃而解
with that camera and I suddenly solve these smooth

330
00:18:17,595 --> 00:18:20,103
这种移动方式是从前的摄影经验里没有的
it’s possible movements I didn’t know in my cinema

331
00:18:21,878 --> 00:18:24,896
而这变成了我对《家宴》的贡献
And that became my donation for <i> celebration<i>

332
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,532
《家宴》意味着什么
What <i> celebration<i> meant

333
00:18:26,533 --> 00:18:30,000
其它这个领域的电影又意味着什么
and what a lot of the other films at that area meant?

334
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
{\a6}白痴，1998

335
00:18:30,127 --> 00:18:35,421
是不是要完全重新思考电影制作的技术层面了呢
Was that you just have to completely rethink the technical side of the film making

336
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:37,000
{\a6}敏郎悲歌，1999

337
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,786
这些电影让人完全可以为了创意而创作
they brought people to film making for creativities sake

338
00:18:37,062 --> 00:18:40,000
{\a6}驴孩朱丽安，1999

339
00:18:40,062 --> 00:18:43,062
{\a6}国王不死，2000

340
00:18:42,402 --> 00:18:46,800
这些电影证明电影制作原理只是为创意服务而已
They pointed out that the mechanism of film making only serves creative

341
00:18:46,954 --> 00:18:49,954
{\a6}查克和贝克，2000

342
00:18:52,675 --> 00:18:54,208
用DV拍摄
With DV

343
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:57,208
{\a6}杰森 科略特，制片
（查克和贝克/咖啡与香烟/夺命手术）

344
00:18:54,347 --> 00:18:55,926
都是为了…
Came this whole idea of

345
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:57,273
等等
wait a second

346
00:18:57,274 --> 00:18:59,687
要是我们能降低预算
if we lower our budgets

347
00:19:00,137 --> 00:19:04,410
作为导演和制片人来说就能有更大的自由度
we get more freedom as directors and producers

348
00:19:04,468 --> 00:19:08,137
用DV拍电影意味着这就是一坨屎
Shooting a film on video of that point meant it was crap

349
00:19:04,468 --> 00:19:07,468
{\a6}乔弗利 吉尔莫，电影节导演
（翠贝卡电影节/圣丹斯电影节）

350
00:19:08,267 --> 00:19:13,097
这基本上是个难以接受的事实
It was almost unaccepted truth

351
00:19:13,098 --> 00:19:15,100
你并没有认真拍电影
that you didn’t shoot films

352
00:19:15,101 --> 00:19:19,320
因为那是录像格式
that you’re serious about on any kind of video format

353
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,560
我们去那然后说：
We just started going out there and we are saying:

354
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:23,975
听着，我们要用数位拍摄
Look, we’re gonna make movie digitally

355
00:19:23,976 --> 00:19:25,786
我们要做导演最终剪辑
we’re gonna give director’s final cut

356
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:27,505
全程尽在掌握
Totally create of control

357
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,685
不过我们会让这一切更省钱
But we’ll make them cheaper

358
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,136
我们的第一部电影是《查克和贝克》
And our very first movie was <i>chuck and buck<i>

359
00:19:32,147 --> 00:19:33,447
<i>你好啊贝克<i>
<i>Hey Buck<i>

360
00:19:33,612 --> 00:19:34,587
<i>…好呀<i>
<i>uh, Hi<i>

361
00:19:36,797 --> 00:19:38,329
<i>喝点啥吗？<i>
<i>can I get you something to drink?<i>

362
00:19:38,505 --> 00:19:40,919
<i>不用，没事<i>
<i>oh, no, that’s alright<i>

363
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:43,516
看回放会吓到自己
Looking at rushes it will scary yourself

364
00:19:43,697 --> 00:19:45,044
<i>冰糕要吗？<i>
<i>would you like some icecream?<i>

365
00:19:45,624 --> 00:19:50,030
<i>真的吗，我爱冰糕耶<i>
<i>really? uh, I like icecream <i>

366
00:19:50,031 --> 00:19:51,888
天哪，看起来真够业余
Oh god, it looks so amateur

367
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,182
很多人其实…
A lot of people actually…

368
00:19:55,254 --> 00:19:57,854
都是模仿
come it on hell modeled it looked

369
00:19:57,855 --> 00:19:59,928
<i>你特么想什么呢<i>
<i>what you’re thinking you fucking doing, man<i>

370
00:20:00,126 --> 00:20:02,540
我记得我们把它在圣丹斯上放映的情形
I remember when we presenting it on Sundance

371
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,537
可吓死他们了
they were scared to death

372
00:20:04,645 --> 00:20:07,339
观影指南上写的就是这是拿DV拍的
The direction would be “this was shot on video”

373
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:11,224
这样的数位摄制作品作为
The digital presentation did not look nearly

374
00:20:11,698 --> 00:20:15,460
胶片的替代品简直难以接受
at any way gonna be acceptable substitute of what film was

375
00:20:15,461 --> 00:20:18,845
因为...毛片
Because of…porn

376
00:20:18,846 --> 00:20:20,610
还有纪录片
And because of documentary

377
00:20:20,611 --> 00:20:21,864
还有新闻报道
and because of news footage

378
00:20:21,865 --> 00:20:25,532
小型摄像机视频让你觉得：
Video occupied the space in your mind like:

379
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,849
我在这，在这房间里，天，一切真的在发生
I’m here I’m in that room oh my god, this is really happening

380
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:31,000
而这让《查克和巴克》更好
And that makes <i>chuck and buck<i> better

381
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
{\a6}艾伦 库拉斯，摄影
（迷途人生/暖暖内含光/大毒枭）

382
00:20:31,001 --> 00:20:32,950
人们开始
People were starting to think

383
00:20:32,951 --> 00:20:35,226
用完全不同的眼光去审视
in a completely different way about

384
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:37,809
技术和媒介
How could the technology and medium

385
00:20:37,879 --> 00:20:42,244
如何帮助我们重新思考电影制作
help us to rethink film making

386
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,715
你发现人们开始挑战传统观念
You start to see people start to challenge the idea

387
00:20:45,715 --> 00:20:48,715
{\a6}迷途人生，2002

388
00:20:46,716 --> 00:20:49,826
像InDigEnt（独立数位娱乐）这样的组织
as the group as InDigEnt (Independent Digital Entertainment )

389
00:20:50,727 --> 00:20:54,024
他们制作标清视频
They were creating standard def video

390
00:20:54,141 --> 00:20:59,343
然后用视频拼成电影再放出
That within they converted to film for seen actual released

391

作为一个独立电影人
I think as a independent film maker

393
00:21:01,054 --> 00:21:03,978
我认为我们正处于最令人兴奋的时代
we are at the most exciting time ever

394
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,040
因为现在我们能出去用DV拍摄电影
Because now we can go out and make a film on DV

395
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,440
{\a6}蝌蚪，2002

396
00:21:08,584 --> 00:21:10,534
<i>奥斯卡交了新女友<i>
<i>Oscar has a new girlfriend<i>

397
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:12,468
<i>真的吗<i>
<i>really? <i>

398
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,715
<i>我们昨天好像讨论了很长时间这个话题了<i>
<i>it seems last day we get quite late for that conversation<i>

399
00:21:17,181 --> 00:21:21,361
有种想法是你要是用数位拍那就一定便宜
The idea was that if you shoot digitally it was cheap

400
00:21:21,512 --> 00:21:25,738
所以彻底的帮助提升了电影制作的数量
And absolutely helped fill the number of movies that gotten make

401
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,136
我记得我在圣丹斯的头一年
I remember my first year on Sundance

402
00:21:28,301 --> 00:21:32,806
在虚构作品类中我们遣返了35部提交作品
we return 35 submissions total of the fiction category

403
00:21:33,103 --> 00:21:35,379
几年以后就翻了10倍
few years later it was 10 times of that

404
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,145
在圣诞斯电影节上
back to that Sundance days

405
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:45,354
有InDigEnt的作品，人们都觉得还好，毕竟是独立作品
the releases of InDigEnt, people were saying that’s ok for you as independent

406
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,040
{\a6}卡罗林 卡普兰，制片
（蝌蚪/迷途人生/四月碎片）

407
00:21:45,402 --> 00:21:47,910
不过这不是电影
But this isn’t cinema this isn’t…

408
00:21:48,443 --> 00:21:53,644
这种说法很流行，用DV做电影再去圣丹斯
That was a huge saying to make film on a video camera and go to Sundance

409
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:57,624
我们因《迷途人生》赢得了最佳导演和最佳影片
And win best director, and win beat film for <i>personal velocity<i>

410
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,036
盖瑞自己的《蝌蚪》
Gary’s own film <i>tadpole<i>

411
00:22:00,037 --> 00:22:02,637
就比较倾向于大众
And being sort of for normal man’s money

412
00:22:02,638 --> 00:22:05,330
每个人都在努力：娱乐大众好赚钱
Everyone worked on it: make money from that sale

413
00:22:05,603 --> 00:22:11,548
这就是大家都觉得用数位摄像没问题的时候
And that’s when a lot of the idea you can shoot film digitally

414
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,229
就像是对商品美学的品头论足
And it’s almost like a production aesthetic

415
00:22:14,535 --> 00:22:16,393
争论开始了
And that’s when all those debates started

416
00:22:16,425 --> 00:22:18,685
您一定知道
You must have heard that late 90s

417
00:22:18,686 --> 00:22:22,911
90年代末电影的金标准和您使用的工具是什么呢
film’s gold standard and the tool you playing with are what?

418
00:22:22,912 --> 00:22:24,885
贬低或推崇
debasing, fattening

419
00:22:25,574 --> 00:22:27,711
我曾经受过打击…
I have been slapped around if you wanna…

420
00:22:27,712 --> 00:22:28,779
“打击”是怎么回事
What do you mean “slapped around”？

421
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:33,559
(?)我被说成是个爆发基佬
(?)I mean I’ve been exploded and homosexualcated for the sentence

422
00:22:33,873 --> 00:22:37,217
对我来说转投数位摄影是显然的
It was a quite obvious to me to go to digital

423
00:22:37,218 --> 00:22:41,907
因为你可以熟练使用摄像机
because of mature you can have the camera

424
00:22:41,908 --> 00:22:44,843
这种成熟程度显而易见
The amount of the mature you can have your camera was obvious

425
00:22:45,783 --> 00:22:50,287
既然我决定用另一种工作方式创作
since I was trying to create another way of working with other tools

426
00:22:50,734 --> 00:22:52,313
这点是比较重要的
And that was essential

427
00:22:52,406 --> 00:22:55,406
{\a6}大卫 林奇，导演
（蓝丝绒/象人/穆赫兰道）

428
00:22:52,406 --> 00:22:54,914
为了拍长镜头
I imagine there was collaboration for you than

429
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:58,731
我猜您需要和演员密切合作是吗
terms of the relationship with your actors for longer takes？

430
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:01,006
是啊，基努
Yes you know, Keanu

431
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:04,587
10分钟到头了，其实根本没10分钟
10-minute is maximum, it wasn’t really 10

432
00:23:04,588 --> 00:23:05,980
9分钟吧也就
9 or something

433
00:23:06,257 --> 00:23:08,700
当那玩意儿开始转的时候
When that thing starts rolling

434
00:23:09,425 --> 00:23:11,747
有种感觉
There’s kina underline feeling

435
00:23:11,748 --> 00:23:14,700
宝贝开始转了
that precious stuff rolling through there

436
00:23:14,872 --> 00:23:18,309
这让所有东西都紧张
And it puts kind of a tension on things

437
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,677
我想拍多长拍多长
Like a shoot as much as I wanted

438
00:23:20,678 --> 00:23:22,303
我可以有最好的表演
I can get the best performances

439
00:23:22,304 --> 00:23:25,600
我不用担心拍片是烧胶片
I didn’t have to worry about shooting is a little burst of film

440
00:23:25,601 --> 00:23:27,423
这太荒谬了，不过我曾经就是这么担心的
That was ridiculous but that was what I had to do

441
00:23:27,424 --> 00:23:30,581
相对来说曾经就是那么贵
that’s how expensive it was comparatively

442
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:36,017
数位摄影的话，一个小东西能拍40分钟
Digital, a little gizmo, 40 minutes

443
00:23:36,018 --> 00:23:39,732
你能边拍
And you can be running this camera

444
00:23:39,733 --> 00:23:42,008
边和演员讲话
and talking to the actor

445
00:23:42,009 --> 00:23:43,865
再来也没问题
Starting over again

446
00:23:50,786 --> 00:23:52,690
他们能够融入进去
And they get down in there

447
00:23:52,691 --> 00:23:55,940
能抓拍以前的巨型设备
And catch a thing never would get caught

448
00:23:55,941 --> 00:23:58,820
几乎从来没拍到过的东西
if you have the giant thing there

449
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,820
{\a6}达内尔 马丁，导演
（冷门独立，不翻了…）

450
00:23:58,821 --> 00:24:00,558
我喜欢用摄像机工作
I love to on the camera

451
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,587
尤其是到感情洋溢的地方，魔法就发生了
Especially when we were at the emotional place that magic is happening

452
00:24:04,588 --> 00:24:08,453
你喊停的时候，突然间所有人都去那了
When you go cut, That all of a sudden everybody’s in there

453
00:24:08,454 --> 00:24:13,118
而你就在那
And you were at a place where it is just there

454
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,604
接着万物静止
And then everything stops

455
00:24:14,605 --> 00:24:16,045
接着是“好了，我们继续”
then “that’s ok, now go back to that”

456
00:24:16,046 --> 00:24:18,460
而我说：“等等，要搞下摄像机，一分钟就好”
And I said “no, just went to the camera, back to one”

457
00:24:21,817 --> 00:24:25,857
你要能够快归位
As fast as you can get back to your position

458
00:24:22,867 --> 00:24:25,867
{\a6}约翰 马尔科维奇，演员
（危险关系/太阳帝国/赤焰战场）

459
00:24:26,145 --> 00:24:27,678
你还能再次离开
You can go again

460
00:24:28,406 --> 00:24:31,610
我就是觉得等待的时间好多啊
I just thought there was way too much waiting

461
00:24:31,611 --> 00:24:35,755
电影于我总有个动力问题
Because movies for me there is always momentum problem

462
00:24:35,755 --> 00:24:40,904
因为我成长于剧院，那也是我接受表演训练的地方
Cause I grow up in the theater and that’s how I was trained

463
00:24:40,905 --> 00:24:43,133
不过在拍电影的大多数时间我…
and a lot of time in movies I…

464
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,174
总有种感觉：“我们能走了么？”
feel like “can we go？”

465
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:50,520
对我来说连拍45分钟简直太难了
it‘s very tough for me to be able to shoot 45 minutes

466
00:24:50,521 --> 00:24:51,887
不是摄像机换胶卷的问题
Not reload of the cameras

467
00:24:51,888 --> 00:24:55,000
因为整个团队都不能再集中精神
Because it’s true this entire group can’t get on concentrate

468
00:24:55,001 --> 00:24:59,272
演员就能集中那么久，所以你需要2-3分钟的休息
The actors can only concentrate for so long and you need 2-min-break, 3-min-break

469
00:24:59,273 --> 00:25:00,757
正好换胶卷
during which time you reload

470
00:25:00,762 --> 00:25:02,759
当你用胶片摄像机拍摄的时候
When you’re running a film camera on sight

471
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,917
每个人都比较严肃
everyone seems to take things a little bit more seriously

472
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:07,989
当他们听见胶卷转的时候
When they hear the film running

473
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:10,713
其实基本上听见的都是钱的声音
they hear the money running on the camera basically

474
00:25:10,714 --> 00:25:12,524
每个人都全神贯注
Everybody brings an aim

475
00:25:16,878 --> 00:25:22,915
我头次听说摄像机里有胶卷在转的时候
The first time I’d ever heard the word a film going through a camera

476
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,800
{\a6}格蕾塔 葛韦格，演员
（格林伯格/亚瑟/爱情无线牵）

477
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:27,960
又兴奋又紧张
It was thrilling also make me very nervous because

478
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:35,475
因为突然间每一帧都要算钱，而我以前从未经历过
All of a sudden each take counted in a way that I never really experienced before

479
00:25:35,476 --> 00:25:37,472
在你喊“开始”的瞬间感觉如何
what about that moment after you say “action”

480
00:25:37,473 --> 00:25:39,701
比如对我来说，摄像机开始工作
Like for me, when that cameras rolling

481
00:25:39,702 --> 00:25:41,466
我猜肯定是和钱有联系，不过
I guess maybe it’s connected to the money but...

482
00:25:41,467 --> 00:25:43,881
10分钟也太有限了
the 10-minute reel is so finite

483
00:25:43,882 --> 00:25:47,178
这简直就像竞技体育，你得集中再集中..
It’s almost athletic thing like focus, focus…

484
00:25:43,882 --> 00:25:46,882
{\a6}理查德 林克莱特，导演
（黑暗扫描仪/都市浪人/年少轻狂）

485
00:25:48,538 --> 00:25:52,485
然后，“嗯这个不错”这样
Like that’s good for them

486
00:25:52,486 --> 00:25:54,381
其实就是个气氛
that’s just atmosphere though

487
00:25:55,295 --> 00:25:57,476
我的意思是，你要是那么想肯定感觉的到
I mean if you want that you can create that, right

488
00:25:57,476 --> 00:26:00,476
{\a6}丹尼 鲍尔，导演
（海滩/惊变28天/贫民窟的百万富翁）

489
00:25:57,477 --> 00:25:59,380
我觉得演员的情况会不一样
I thought it could make a difference through actors

490
00:25:59,381 --> 00:26:00,970
不用给一堆第二次拍摄机会
Don’t give a dozen particularly twice

491
00:26:00,971 --> 00:26:06,447
我可以不断的调整到他们觉得合适
I Just infinitely give adjust whatever way they have to tell it they’ll tell it

492
00:26:06,448 --> 00:26:09,698
你不会暂停也不说：“嘿，能停了么”
You didn’t ask for a break you didn’t say:”hey, can we stop”

493
00:26:09,699 --> 00:26:11,973
你现在用的是数位摄像吗？--没错
You are on digital now -- yeah

494
00:26:11,974 --> 00:26:16,292
我第一次经历到没有暂停的拍摄是
Though my first experience is, without which is, there is no cut

495
00:26:16,849 --> 00:26:20,054
和理查德 林克莱特合作的《黑暗扫描仪》
I worked with Richard Linklater on the film called <i>Scanner Darkly<i>

496
00:26:20,055 --> 00:26:22,183
就像--你继续吧
It just lik -- you can just go on

497
00:26:22,184 --> 00:26:24,737
对，我哀求道“我们停下来吧”
Yeah, I just like “can we please stop”

498
00:26:25,615 --> 00:26:26,637
停下吧~
Stop~

499
00:26:27,828 --> 00:26:29,175
不，没那必要
No, we don’t have to

500
00:26:29,176 --> 00:26:30,847
但是我想停下来啊！
But I want to！

501
00:26:32,318 --> 00:26:35,708
罗伯特唐尼找到我说：
Robert Downey actually came up to me, and he said: 

502
00:26:35,709 --> 00:26:37,333
“这样工作我不行的
“I can’t work like this,

503
00:26:37,334 --> 00:26:40,360
“我找不到我的拖车，我从来也没整理过自己的东西
“I never get to my trailer, I never get my shit together

504
00:26:40,361 --> 00:26:43,685
“我一天站14个小时，我一直在拍啊拍啊。”
“I’m on my feet 14 hours a day, I’m shooting all the time.”

505
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:48,998
他把盛尿的石头罐子放片场了
He actually left mason jars of urine on the set

506
00:26:49,186 --> 00:26:50,765
就放角落里
Just like over in the corner stuff

507
00:26:50,766 --> 00:26:52,832
他会出去尿完了再放回来
just he will go off and pee in it and bring it back

508
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:54,968
拿这个跟我抗议
this is like a form of protest

509
00:26:55,819 --> 00:27:00,570
以前，用赛璐珞拍片真的好兴奋啊
Previously, what’s on celluloid only really has been thrilled

510
00:27:00,563 --> 00:27:04,082
那种获得赛璐珞圣杯的感觉，很神奇
to arrive a holy grail of celluloid, it’s amazing

511
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:05,800
所以我们的头几部电影是用赛璐珞拍的
so we made the first few films on celluloid

512
00:27:05,801 --> 00:27:07,936
而且我做了道不错的好莱坞大餐
and I made a very big of Hollywood film

513
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,224
《海滩》
<i>the beach<i>

514
00:27:09,224 --> 00:27:12,224
{\a6}海滩，2000

515
00:27:09,225 --> 00:27:12,243
和李奥纳多迪卡普里奥，还有很大的一个工作团队
with Leonardo Di Caprio, and a big crew

516
00:27:12,244 --> 00:27:13,776
不过这一点也不适合我
and it didn’t suit me at all

517
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,761
感觉担子实在太重
I felt it was too much weight for me really somehow

518
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:21,393
接下来我看到了《家宴》
And so I then saw <i>celebration<i>

519
00:27:21,393 --> 00:27:24,143
{\a6}家宴，1998

520
00:27:24,239 --> 00:27:27,118
不像电影，也不像眼见
wasn’t so much the film, wasn’t even a look

521
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:29,486
单纯的摄像机操作
It was the camera operating

522
00:27:29,487 --> 00:27:31,205
和摄像移动
Movement of the camera

523
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:36,954
所以我找到拍摄它的人：安东尼 多德 曼妥
So I got with the guy who shot it, Anthony Dod Mantle

524
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:40,948
我觉得像是离经叛道
And I said I feel like not doing the right thing any more

525
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,338
“我们一起做点什么吧，用数位摄像”
“Can we do something together, Digitally”

526
00:27:44,339 --> 00:27:47,914
我都不知道自己在说啥，不过觉得像个新世界
which I didn’t know what I ‘m saying by saying that It was kind like a new world anyway

527
00:27:47,915 --> 00:27:50,608
接着我们就着手制作《惊变28天》
Then we came with the script <i>28 days later<i>

528
00:27:50,899 --> 00:27:53,899
{\a6}惊变28天，2002

529
00:27:51,459 --> 00:27:53,595
这是我们用消费型摄像机拍的
And we shot it on consumer cameras

530
00:27:54,691 --> 00:27:56,548
但是我记得安东尼对我说过
But I remember Anthony saying to me

531
00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:02,028
这个格式没问题的，不过我们这辈子也没法得奥斯卡了
It’s all vey well working in this format and he said we’ll never get an Oscar

532
00:28:03,327 --> 00:28:07,320
开始的时候有个场景，斯里安墨菲要演的
There was a scene in the beginning what the character Cillian Murphy wanted it run

533
00:28:07,321 --> 00:28:08,806
荒废的伦敦
A deserted London

534
00:28:11,041 --> 00:28:13,874
要是用胶片，这片子怕是无法完成
We will not be able to achieve the film on film

535
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:16,893
因为我们没那么多钱去阻断交通
Because we have to stop the traffic and we did not get enough money to do it

536
00:28:16,894 --> 00:28:19,911
所以我们只是短暂的挡了一会儿交通
So what we do is just hold the traffic briefly

537
00:28:19,912 --> 00:28:23,394
但是因为我们是用这些摄像机拍的，能用10个一起拍
But because we run these cameras, we could use ten of them

538
00:28:23,395 --> 00:28:24,462
因为太便宜了
cause it’s so cheap

539
00:28:25,584 --> 00:28:28,927
而且他可以走过伦敦中心和其他区域
and he can walk through central London and areas of it

540
00:28:28,928 --> 00:28:32,457
我们有10台摄像机，只要交通停止几分钟就行
We have 10 cameras of that, so you only have to stop the traffic for a few minutes

541
00:28:32,458 --> 00:28:34,779
接着就有10个拍摄画面了
Then you would actually have 10 shots

542
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:36,961
这可是一大进步
That was enormous advantage

543
00:28:37,302 --> 00:28:39,253
我们拿摄像机到处转
We plays cameras around

544
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,817
不是随机的、坏的、漫无目的的
Not coinciding not badly not loosely

545
00:28:41,818 --> 00:28:44,371
我试图控制每个角度而且我知道哪些更好
I tried to control every angle and I know what few ways is best

546
00:28:44,705 --> 00:28:45,959
用哪个更好
What’s gonna be used

547
00:28:46,218 --> 00:28:50,212
不过之前可以任意看，来获得新的设想
But that said you can let anyone there, and have a little new guesses there

548
00:28:50,596 --> 00:28:53,429
你是在拍有很小人像的广角镜头
You are in a wide shot with small figures in it

549
00:28:53,669 --> 00:28:56,030
也就2-3个像素
They were just like 2-3 pixels

550
00:28:56,031 --> 00:28:57,748
我是说那几乎啥也没有，就是颜色而已
I mean there’s nothing there, they were just color

551
00:28:58,127 --> 00:29:01,843
颜色是比较明智的做法，要是同质拷贝到胶片上
color is wise if you put it up against exact copy of they were on film

552
00:29:01,844 --> 00:29:03,607
那这张胶片会巨大无比
The film will be imagerily superior

553
00:29:03,823 --> 00:29:08,188
不过你却可以偷着拍，代替性的拍，不让人知道
But you can shoot illegally, substitutedly without people knowing

554
00:29:08,189 --> 00:29:10,046
你可以不照套路出牌
You could do unconventional things

555
00:29:10,047 --> 00:29:13,714
这时影片的节奏
And the rhythm of film which is passed on since it began

556
00:29:13,848 --> 00:29:15,195
(?)镜头的连续
(?)Cruise of lens

557
00:29:15,196 --> 00:29:17,471
就都被打断了,我喜欢这种自由感
You interrupted that, I love that freedom

558
00:29:17,472 --> 00:29:21,511
所以尝到甜头后，我知道这样的设计要怎么做了
And I got taste for it then, I knew which way to chalk that sequence

559
00:29:22,143 --> 00:29:25,069
所以我正在做这件事，而结果也和我想要的一样
so I was gonna work on it now, that wasI want it to work

560
00:29:27,381 --> 00:29:34,626
这让剪辑的工作变得特别（繁杂），因为常常有大量的材料涌入
It makes the editor’s job extraordinary cause it’s often plumbing through Masses and masses and masses material

561
00:29:35,407 --> 00:29:37,265
70-80年代
In the 1970s and 80s

562
00:29:37,256 --> 00:29:42,188
电气公司开始着手可以取代胶片剪辑的解决方案
electronics companies began working on solutions to replace film editing

563
00:29:42,835 --> 00:29:48,494
100多年来，剪辑人员都是手动剪切粘贴胶片的
For over 100 years, editing man physically cutting and connecting pieces of film

564
00:29:48,622 --> 00:29:50,852
我们以前常去剪辑室
we used to go to the editing room

565
00:29:50,836 --> 00:29:52,787
他们把胶卷抽到剪切盒里
they were rolling them into the trim basket

566
00:29:53,081 --> 00:29:56,939
把现在的胶片放到滚动轴上
they took the film now, and put that through the moving roll

567
00:29:57,093 --> 00:30:00,093
{\a6}汤姆 罗斯曼，福克斯影业首席CEO

568
00:29:57,093 --> 00:29:58,579
然后像这样啪啪的把他们粘到一起
and you slap it together like this

569
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:01,691
那些戴白手套的干这个难以置信的快
you remember the white gloves and they’re incredibly fast at it

570
00:30:01,692 --> 00:30:08,378
我摸到（胶片）边缘，有时候很锋利，会把手指割出血
I find a frame and Sometimes blazing and get your fingertips bloodied

571
00:30:08,379 --> 00:30:10,241
这可是真的“电影上的血”啊
that’s just really the blood in the film

572
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:14,049
我是说真的血，不过现在这一切都变成神奇小按钮了
So I mean really had it and now it’s fascinating buttons

573
00:30:14,094 --> 00:30:16,230
<i>这是一张大家都熟悉的软盘...<i>
<i>now this is the floppy disk we all familiar…<i>

574
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:19,696
早期的剪辑系统使用可塑磁碟
early editing systems use moldable magnetic disks

575
00:30:19,697 --> 00:30:21,739
磁带机和镭射光碟
tape machines and laser disks

576
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,433
来存储并读取数字化的胶片
to store and read digitaled of film

577
00:30:24,449 --> 00:30:27,653
这些系统大多特别贵
most of the systems are enormously very costly

578
00:30:27,856 --> 00:30:30,856
{\a6}费尔 曼休斯，摄影
（皇家赌场/佐罗传奇/偷天陷阱）

579
00:30:27,856 --> 00:30:32,221
我想后来改变一切的第一件事应该是我知道了剪辑机器
the first thing I have read that changed everything I think it was the digital editing machine

580
00:30:32,712 --> 00:30:35,545
可以花一天把胶片变成影带
which spend a daily set and converted film into tape

581
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,954
所以一切从这开始
so that’s started the whole thing going

582
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:43,639
我们研发了一台全数字化的图像剪辑系统
we start a picture editing system that was all digital

583
00:30:43,771 --> 00:30:46,771
{\a6} “editdroid”剪辑系统

584
00:30:43,771 --> 00:30:47,672
我们的第一台editdroid在1980年开始工作
we had the first “editdroid” working in 1980

585
00:30:48,338 --> 00:30:51,542
我们最后把它卖给了AVID
and we eventually sold the system to AVID

586
00:30:51,825 --> 00:30:53,264
80年代末
by the late 1980s

587
00:30:53,265 --> 00:30:59,534
AVID把数位剪辑发展成了密集型、有偿高效、全电脑控制的系统
AVID had developed digital editing into a compacted cost-effective computer-based system

588
00:30:59,781 --> 00:31:02,411
我第一次看到AVID的时候
when I first saw the AVID

589
00:30:59,781 --> 00:31:02,781
{\a6}格雷格 伍德，剪辑
（加勒比海盗/浪人47/午夜凶铃）

590
00:31:02,782 --> 00:31:07,800
我看见又小又灰暗的图像在里面
I have a dimmer image quality was block in, tiny

591
00:31:07,811 --> 00:31:13,013
然后我说，这个要是在五年时间内能把图像质量提高就好了
and I said: this is gonna be really good if they give the image quality right about in 5 years time

592
00:31:13,013 --> 00:31:16,013
{\a6}沃特 默奇，剪辑
（现代启示录/英国病人/冷山）

593
00:31:13,013 --> 00:31:14,532
为什么不试试AVID
why not try it on the AVID

594
00:31:14,533 --> 00:31:17,706
我也是最早那批采用者之一
I’m also one of the earlier adopter people

595
00:31:17,707 --> 00:31:19,876
我喜欢探索未知世界
I like to leap into the unknown

596
00:31:22,342 --> 00:31:24,896
我记得做《英国病人》的时候
I remember on the <i>English patient<i>

597
00:31:24,897 --> 00:31:31,955
我看着它的画面说：“天啊，我要怎么做啊”
I look at in the images and “no, how I’m gonna to be able to do this?”

598
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,220
{\a6}德里克 安布罗西，剪辑
（致命急件）

599
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,564
我和老一辈的剪辑一起工作时
when I work with elder editors

600
00:31:35,565 --> 00:31:39,419
他们总是提起电脑刚刚被被用到这项工作上的时候
they’ll often to talk about the time when computers were starting to come in

601
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:44,297
他们对此比较抵触，因为他们不熟悉电脑
and they were very resistant to it because they weren’t familiar with computers

602
00:31:44,409 --> 00:31:48,124
他们害怕因为对电脑了解不够
they were just scared that they didn’t know enough about it

603
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:54,440
可能导致不小心按错键或是意外关机开机，然后啥都没了
if you push that button or if you accidentally turn it off wrong or turn it on wrong that everything will be gone

604
00:31:54,441 --> 00:31:58,527
但你要是拿手去做这些情况不可能发生
while that could never happen if you actually physically have the film in your hand

605
00:31:58,528 --> 00:32:00,941
他们觉得自己根本就没在剪辑，剪辑其实是…
they thought that was not editing, editing is…

606
00:32:02,072 --> 00:32:04,951
不管胶片怎么剪辑
so when you’re editing the movie on film

607
00:32:04,952 --> 00:32:07,598
都是技术而已，而艺术
that’s just technology, the art form

608
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:10,570
是操纵画面来讲故事
is the manipulation of images to tell a story

609
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:13,570
{\a6}安 科兹，剪辑
（阿拉伯的劳伦斯/永不妥协/黄金罗盘）

610
00:32:10,571 --> 00:32:13,032
操作起来挺难的
it was extremely difficult major that

611
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:16,709
因为我以前没用过电脑
because I haven’t used a computer

612
00:32:16,961 --> 00:32:21,366
我见过老鼠（鼠标）到处跑，不过可不是在剪辑室
I’ve seen a mouse somewhere across the floor but not in the editing room

613
00:32:21,652 --> 00:32:26,269
不过我学了，还用了很长一段时间
but I learnt and I keep the machine quite a bit

614
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:29,693
不过不用电脑我也无所谓，我也喜欢这样
but once I don’t doing on it that’s ok and I like it

615
00:32:29,712 --> 00:32:31,644
剪辑处没有胶片
there’s no film in the editing bay

616
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,780
一切都
it’s all…

617
00:32:35,433 --> 00:32:38,594
{\a6}克里斯 莱本森
（爱丽丝梦游仙境/世界末日/壮志凌云）

618
00:32:35,433 --> 00:32:36,594
一切都好安静
it’s quite

619
00:32:36,595 --> 00:32:38,767
我听不见以前常听见的“rururu”的声音
I don’t hear I used to hear the “rururu…”

620
00:32:38,768 --> 00:32:41,228
就是工作台上的卷轴发出的
the reel on the benches

621
00:32:41,229 --> 00:32:44,897
一直都是非常吵杂的工作环境
it was very noisy kind of buzzing atmosphere

622
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:52,560
不过现在特别安静，好像所有的声音都能像蜡烛一样被烧掉
and now it’s very quite, almost like that you can burn any sound like candles

623
00:32:55,116 --> 00:32:58,367
数位技术把事情变得高效
digital bring you the speed and almost

624
00:32:58,552 --> 00:33:03,570
不过同时也在挑战你：“我能想那么快吗？”
challenge you the sense of “can I think that fast”

625
00:33:03,812 --> 00:33:05,623
“我有时间喘气吗”
“do I need time to breathe?”

626
00:33:06,242 --> 00:33:10,979
有时年轻的剪辑总是充满兴趣，还做着非常有趣的工作
sometime are young editors are over-interesting and doing extremely interesting work

627
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:16,923
但他们不总是有时间安静坐下来并思考自己到底在做什么
but they don’t always have the time to sit back and think about what they are doing

628
00:33:17,592 --> 00:33:19,961
不过我想他们要是用胶片来工作
and I think if they work on film

629
00:33:19,962 --> 00:33:24,001
就必须要训练他们的思想来实现这点
they probably have to train their mind to do that

630
00:33:24,511 --> 00:33:26,973
真的是另一种思考方式
so it’s a different way of thinking, really

631
00:33:27,084 --> 00:33:29,731
胶片用条条框框折磨你
film torture you with discipline

632
00:33:29,732 --> 00:33:32,732
{\a6}持摄影机的人，1929

633
00:33:29,909 --> 00:33:33,439
用电脑的话就没那么痛苦了
that it’s gone a little bit from the computer

634
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,013
因为一旦你动了剪子
because you once put the scissors in

635
00:33:36,364 --> 00:33:39,052
就得拿胶布再粘起来
you’ve been got to join it back with sticky tape

636
00:33:39,136 --> 00:33:41,400
再连到机器上
and bond it through the machine

637
00:33:41,401 --> 00:33:43,230
这个过程你是关键
you’re much more decisive about that

638
00:33:44,331 --> 00:33:45,956
剪辑过程变更好了吗？
has editing got any better?

639
00:33:46,151 --> 00:33:48,705
就因为选择变多了？我觉得不一定
because it’s infinite the choice? I’m not so sure

640
00:33:47,705 --> 00:33:50,705
{\a6}洛伦佐 狄波纳文图拉，制片
（变形金刚/特工绍特/窗台上的男人）

641
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:51,916
不过有件事情比较肯定，现在的很多电影更烂了
but I’m pretty sure that a lot of movies are getting worse

642
00:33:52,542 --> 00:33:56,768
因为你将它推向死亡
because you manipulate it to death

643
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:58,456
我们会失去很多东西
we may lost something

644
00:33:58,771 --> 00:34:03,554
《阿拉伯的劳伦斯》中，当他划亮火柴
the cutting that <i>Lawrence of Arabia<i> when he blows the match up

645
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,466
<i>看得出来您有着有趣的幽默感<i>
<i>this is recognized that you have a funny sense of fun<i>

646
00:34:07,668 --> 00:34:09,758
这只是写在剧本里
that was the solving script

647
00:34:09,845 --> 00:34:12,956
不过要是有我们今天的数字技术
and if you’ve been on digital as we have on that today

648
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,832
看准就行了
you just have to see it

649
00:34:16,117 --> 00:34:19,229
不过那时候，电影都是一段一段粘起来的
in those days, the film were bonded together like that

650
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,668
就靠剪辑
just with the direct cut

651
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:24,809
所以当我们看到这个，我们都惊呼不可思议
so when we saw it, we got “wow, that’s fantastic”

652
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:28,872
想想吧，当时那种感情
just work it, just imagine it, when you feel that feeling

653
00:34:30,727 --> 00:34:37,136
作为影像和声音的承载体，数位拥有不可思议的可塑性
digital is unbelievably malleable plastic of imatery and sound

654
00:34:37,137 --> 00:34:39,969
这很有吸引力，因为我们要的就是可塑性
and that’s seductive, because that’s all we do

655
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:44,245
我们是图像和声音的雕塑者
we are sculptors of images and sound

656
00:34:44,246 --> 00:34:46,149
不是说胶片就做不了
it’s not that you can’t do it in film

657
00:34:46,304 --> 00:34:51,923
就是操作麻烦，而且想做好很难
it’s just harder to do that and make it look good

658
00:34:53,872 --> 00:34:56,798
在数字技术不断发展的同时
as digital technology continued to grow

659
00:34:56,799 --> 00:35:00,188
计算机生成图像，及通常说的CGI
computer generated images or CGI

660
00:35:00,387 --> 00:35:03,035
越来越多的出现在电影中
were appearing more and more in movies

661
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:06,050
{\a6}大都会，1927

662
00:35:05,668 --> 00:35:08,362
视觉特效，或VFX
visul FX or VFX (Visual Special Effects)

663
00:35:08,365 --> 00:35:11,891
自电影成长初期起就成为了电影制作的一部分
have been part of film making since the earliest years

664
00:35:11,891 --> 00:35:14,891
35:11
{\a6}伊阿宋与金羊毛，1963

665
00:35:12,806 --> 00:35:17,683
摄像技巧，灯光技术，精细模型和实验室操作
camera tricks, lighting techniques, elaborate models and lab processes

666
00:35:14,892 --> 00:35:17,892
{\a6}第三类接触，1977

667
00:35:17,859 --> 00:35:22,689
都被用作改变真实并提高电影体验
have all been used to alter realty and enhance the movie going experience

668
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:23,020
{\a6}夺宝奇兵：法柜奇兵，1981

669
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:26,020
{\a6}星际迷航2，1982

670
00:35:23,306 --> 00:35:26,975
好多电影都不是想拍就拍的
on many films that the number is unpredicted you can’t go out and shoot

671
00:35:26,976 --> 00:35:31,549
所以那些你想要的画面就只能想办法制作
so the images you need to see you need to be manufactory in somewhere

672
00:35:28,383 --> 00:35:31,383
{\a6}约翰 科诺，工业光魔视觉特效总监
（阿凡达/加勒比海盗/星球大战1-3）

673
00:35:31,549 --> 00:35:34,549
{\a6}帝国反击战，1980

674
00:35:32,655 --> 00:35:35,953
作为视觉特效总监你得明白
things of visual FX supervisor called on you to understand

675
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
{\a6}蒂姆 韦伯，FrameStone 视觉特效总监
（阿凡达/黑暗骑士/人类之子）

676
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,458
你得了解到这个世界的时时刻刻方方面面
a huge variety of different aspect of the world around us at any one time

677
00:35:40,482 --> 00:35:45,823
你还得明白光反射不同表面的物理知识
you also understand the physics of the way that light reacts of different surfaces

678
00:35:40,482 --> 00:35:43,482
{\a6}独立日，1996

679
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,783
你得明白动画绘制，人怎么动，其他的东西怎么做
you got to understand animation, you got understand the way people move creatures move

680
00:35:51,491 --> 00:35:54,800
你得同时成为艺术家和技师	
you have to be an artist and a technician at the same time

681
00:35:54,834 --> 00:35:57,481
这是个奇妙的组合
that’s an interesting combination

682
00:35:57,783 --> 00:36:00,783
{\a6}丹尼斯 莫伦，工业光魔视觉特效总监
（星球大战/E.T./侏罗纪公园）

683
00:35:57,718 --> 00:36:01,386
最初的视觉特效师和头一百年特效师干的没什么两样
originally visual FX was done was the first hundred years of the FX was done

684
00:36:01,632 --> 00:36:09,480
用模型和胶片摄影，能做的实际很有限
they were done with models and with film cameras and they are very limit what you can do

685
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:16,168
我们花费了很多时间、经历和人们的努力来做《星球大战》
but a lot of time and energy and people worked a lot to being able to make <i>star wars<i> film

686
00:36:21,741 --> 00:36:24,620
22年前我入行的时候
when I first doing this about 22 years ago

687
00:36:24,841 --> 00:36:28,603
我学习的环境是真实的，有个舞台
the environment I learned it was a physical one, it was a stage

688
00:36:24,877 --> 00:36:27,877
{\a6}亚当 瓦尔德斯，MPC视觉特效总监
（指环王/纳尼亚传奇/星河战队）

689
00:36:28,672 --> 00:36:31,690
微缩模型、灯光和其他的一些东西都在那
miniatures, camera lights and everything in it

690
00:36:32,898 --> 00:36:35,777
做真实模型有个好处
the great thing about making real stuff is 

691
00:36:35,778 --> 00:36:39,817
你要用上全部感情和身体感知
you got to use all of your senses and your physical perceptions and

692
00:36:39,818 --> 00:36:42,842
接着3个人和其他挑剔的模型师站过去
stand there are 3 different people and critical modelers

693
00:36:42,843 --> 00:36:46,604
讨论着某件东西在真实光源中是有多酷，那感觉真满足
talks about how cool something looks like in real lighting is pretty satisfying

694
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:52,217
拍出来的东西送去用光学印片机
and all those photography was on the optical printer in the end

695
00:36:53,453 --> 00:36:57,725
就是一部大机器，把多层胶片压在一起
that’s a large device that actually compress layers of film together

696
00:36:57,906 --> 00:37:01,157
然后用这些组合胶片曝光
and creates new exposures of the film so you can combine it the layers

697
00:37:01,158 --> 00:37:03,850
这样组合出来的图像就是电影的最终效果
with images into the final one that you’ve seen in the movie

698
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:13,105
视觉特效部，就是实打实的把胶片一张又一张再一张的叠起来
the visual FX department was literately sandwiching one piece of film next to another piece of film next to another piece of film

699
00:37:08,111 --> 00:37:11,111
{\a6}乔纳森 福克纳，FrameStone视觉特效总监
（阿凡达/大侦探福尔摩斯/V字仇杀队）

700
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:17,173
而这个过程可能引入巨大的人为破坏
and that really introduces huge mantle depredation

701
00:37:18,849 --> 00:37:23,400
1978年，我们刚刚完成了《星球大战》
in 1978, we had just finished <i>star wars<i>

702
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,320
那时候我们没找到更好的数字方法，所以制作还是比较艰苦的
we don’t find digital sharps in there which were very very cruel

703
00:37:28,605 --> 00:37:31,070
比如那个场景的数学图像和其他的一些东西
the diagram with that part kind of thing

704
00:37:31,071 --> 00:37:34,090
不过我知道有些人正在用数位技术做电影
but I knew a lot of guys, they were working with the digital film

705
00:37:34,395 --> 00:37:36,067
所以我成立了一个电脑部门
so I start a computer division

706
00:37:36,627 --> 00:37:40,832
我们在那给工业光魔创立了皮克斯
we developed the pixar computer for ILM

707
00:37:41,186 --> 00:37:44,777
我现在就在我们工业光魔3个电脑室之一
I’m right now with one of our three computer rooms we have here in ILM

708
00:37:44,778 --> 00:37:46,449
我们在这有
and what we have here are

709
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:50,905
时时刻刻都在运行的千千万万的电脑程序
thousand and millions of cycles of computer power going by every single second

710
00:37:50,906 --> 00:37:54,202
我有点强迫他们尽可能取工业光魔的资源
so I kind push the staff use as much as they could in ILM

711
00:37:54,437 --> 00:37:57,502
在视觉组能够提供的情况下
with this graphics crew that we have

712
00:37:56,502 --> 00:37:59,502
{\a6}星际迷航2， 1982

713
00:38:00,335 --> 00:38:01,729
令人兴奋的是
the exciting about it was

714
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:03,540
（数字制作）没那么多规矩
they didn’t feel like with a lot of rules

715
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,322
一点也不像“狂野西部”
they really don’t seems like kind of wild west

716
00:38:06,323 --> 00:38:15,551
扫描胶片到电脑上并在那做修改成为可能
it starts to become possible to scanning film and bringing the film into the computer and make changes to that

717
00:38:17,441 --> 00:38:21,109
数字化胶片的好处太多了
massive advantage to digitizing your film

718
00:38:21,271 --> 00:38:24,847
可以不必造成任何破坏
with that you couldn’t get any depredation

719
00:38:25,342 --> 00:38:28,315
一旦数字化，就是一堆0和1
once it’s digital there is 1s and 0s

720
00:38:28,316 --> 00:38:31,658
这些0和1在整个过程中都不会改变
they just stay 1s and 0s all the way down the pipe

721
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:34,995
数字技术对特效来说变得非常重要
(?)digital became important for a FX point of view

722
00:38:35,081 --> 00:38:39,679
特效斗兽场中的第一条通途
the first path through the system was in the FX arena

723
00:38:39,912 --> 00:38:46,042
利用数字技术来让幻想成真
it was using digital technology to realize visions

724
00:38:46,043 --> 00:38:48,503
要是能把胶片转换成数字
if you can take piece of film you can turn it into numbers

725
00:38:48,688 --> 00:38:51,614
你能够操纵这些数字再变回影片
you can manipulate those numbers through back to the film

726
00:38:51,681 --> 00:38:54,679
不过却没有任何限制
but there’s no limit to what you could do

727
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:58,112
整个世界的大门由此打开
the entire world is wide open

728
00:38:58,262 --> 00:39:02,302
我们所制作的第一个完全数字化的画面
the first real image that we did that was completely digital

729
00:39:02,344 --> 00:39:04,666
是在《少年福尔摩斯》中
was in <i>young Sherlock Holmes<i>

730
00:39:04,666 --> 00:39:07,666
{\a6}少年福尔摩斯，1985

731
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,729
我们有个彩色玻璃做的角色
we have a character made of stained glass

732
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:11,145
那个玻璃看起来像真的
the glass actually looks real

733
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,159
不像画出来的
not like a graphic in that sort

734
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:18,070
花了6个月和7场拍摄，很复杂
and it took 6 months and 7 shots which was pretty complicated

735
00:39:18,071 --> 00:39:20,488
不过最后效果出来的时候很不错
but it’s amazing we got it done at that time

736
00:39:20,496 --> 00:39:23,496
{\a6}詹姆斯 卡梅伦，导演/制片
（阿凡达/泰坦尼克号/终结者）

737
00:39:20,496 --> 00:39:23,190
乔治总是在数字技术上更进一步
George was always progressive about digital

738
00:39:23,409 --> 00:39:29,539
而且技术平台的交互性让人觉得很舒服，很早以前就是如此
(?)and something about the fetch communer you just got comfortable with it really early on

739
00:39:28,189 --> 00:39:31,189
{\a6}深渊，1989

740
00:39:32,174 --> 00:39:35,174
{\a6}终结者2，1991

741
00:39:35,353 --> 00:39:38,110
{\a6}侏罗纪公园，1993

742
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:41,110
{\a6}小猪宝贝，1995

743
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,432
<i>我现在要当一只羊<i>
<i>I was just trying to be a sheep now<i>

744
00:39:40,443 --> 00:39:42,519
<i>哼，狼已经来了<i>
<i>huh, that wolf’s in the world already<i>

745
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:45,519
{\a6}第五元素，1997

746
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:50,302
{\a6}星河战队，1997

747
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,136
那时我们还是用胶片摄像机
now we are still shooting on film

748
00:39:52,227 --> 00:39:54,315
还不能直接使用数字拍摄
we ain’t able to shoot on digital cameras yet

749
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,720
{\a6}泰坦尼克号，1997

750
00:39:54,484 --> 00:39:57,270
不过所有的后期制作已经提前数字化了
but all of the post processes is start in front of line

751
00:40:00,796 --> 00:40:03,066
你怎么进到电脑里的
how did you going into the computer?

752
00:40:04,558 --> 00:40:08,227
我拿出手来让他们照张相
I would have my hand and then they would take a picture of it

753
00:40:08,462 --> 00:40:11,809
{\a6}黑客帝国，1999

754
00:40:09,809 --> 00:40:10,809
然后会有台电脑
and then there was a computer

755
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:13,425
把所有都处理成银一样，那就是我的手
it would do the animation of all look silver and silver hand

756
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,212
然后他们就把这个放到大屏幕上给你看
and they will show you on the movie screen

757
00:40:18,505 --> 00:40:21,756
我们在《黑客帝国三部曲》的经验是
our experience on the trilogy

758
00:40:18,505 --> 00:40:21,520
{\a6}拉娜/安迪 沃卓斯基，导演/制片
（黑客帝国三部曲/极速赛车手/云图）

759
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,390
当你意识到这点其实很有趣
what was really interesting with that you realize

760
00:40:24,391 --> 00:40:28,438
你其实是在碰运气
you are really creating these images in toss

761
00:40:29,433 --> 00:40:33,626
你拍不到这些而只能在电脑上做
you couldn’t shoot the image you made the image in the computer

762
00:40:36,215 --> 00:40:38,723
90年代中后期
middle to late 90s

763
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:44,976
(?)您是如何开始进行视觉特效的？
I guess its standard death… visual FX… where do you get in

764
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:47,283
我们在工业光魔有个做特效的项目
we have program in ILM doing our FX

765
00:40:47,284 --> 00:40:50,719
我们要把胶片转换为数字才能完成
we have convert from film to digital in order to do it

766
00:40:50,831 --> 00:40:54,453
这得花一大笔钱，现在我们已经不用再进行这样的转换了
it’s a huge amount of money just now we don’t have to convert any more

767
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,271
胶片很难处理
film is cumbersome

768
00:40:57,272 --> 00:41:01,798
我想省钱省时间，我要解决这个问题
so I just want to take my money and my time, I’m gonna fix it

769
00:41:02,645 --> 00:41:05,849
我们去索尼公司和他们说
when we went to SONY, and we said:

770
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:10,307
我们帮你造个数位摄像机吧	
we would like to help you work with you to build a digital camera

771
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:16,059
他（卢卡斯）决定星战（前传）第二部要用数位技术拍
he was on the determine that <i>star wars<i> episode 2 can kind be shot digitally

772
00:41:16,553 --> 00:41:20,965
这就意味所有的工作都要为
that means get all that work out, get pipeline figured out for doing

773
00:41:20,096 --> 00:41:23,925
数位拍摄电影准备好
our production at digital cameras

774
00:41:24,151 --> 00:41:27,216
早期数位摄像的问题之一是
one of the problems with early digital capture

775
00:41:27,433 --> 00:41:28,919
图像的分辨率
was resolution

776
00:41:29,105 --> 00:41:32,078
分辨率是由很多因素决定的
resolution is depended on many factors

777
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,121
不过最基本的因素是
but in the most basic terms

778
00:41:34,122 --> 00:41:37,418
摄像机所能记录的像素数
it is the number of pixels that the camera can record

779
00:41:37,419 --> 00:41:40,870
像素数越多，分辨率越高
the more pixels you had, the higher the resolution

780
00:41:40,871 --> 00:41:43,749
图像所具有的细节也更多
and more detail a image would have

781
00:41:44,184 --> 00:41:47,481
一部标准标清摄像机
a typical standard definition of resolution of SD camera

782
00:41:47,482 --> 00:41:52,822
通常具有720 × 480的分辨率
usually have a resolution of about 720 × 480 pixels

783
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:57,455
转折发生在2000年
really, the turn-in point was in the year 2000

784
00:41:57,456 --> 00:42:02,398
我们推出了F900，第一部高清摄像机
we came out with F900 camera which was the first high definition camera

785
00:42:02,399 --> 00:42:05,479
在那之前，所有的数位拍摄看起来都像录像
before that, whatever you look was really look like video

786
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:14,396
高清摄像机可以达到1920分辨率，也就是2K以下
high definition cameras record resolution about 1920 pixels across, just under 2K

787
00:42:15,422 --> 00:42:18,422
{\a6}克隆人进攻，2002

788
00:42:20,313 --> 00:42:22,310
2002年
in 2002

789
00:42:22,311 --> 00:42:24,400
我们完成了《克隆人的进攻》
we did <i>the attack of the clones<i>

790
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:29,160
这是第一部高清摄像的电影
it was the first major feature that was shot high definition

791
00:42:31,596 --> 00:42:34,475
乔治在《星球大战》中
what George did in <i>star wars<i> movie

792
00:42:34,476 --> 00:42:37,866
实验性的使用了高清摄像机
was take experimental HD camera

793
00:42:37,867 --> 00:42:41,395
其画面质量已达到胶片水平
and ply it to feature film parallel

794
00:42:41,396 --> 00:42:44,396
{\a6}卢卡斯影业，旧金山，加利福尼亚

795
00:42:42,472 --> 00:42:44,515
这在当时是不可想象的
that was unthinkable at that time

796
00:42:45,775 --> 00:42:48,979
不仅仅是对电影协会
it meant that it was around the entire film community

797
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:51,952
更是对胶片电影本身
but more deeply mean it was around film itself

798
00:42:52,424 --> 00:42:56,975
那时的好莱坞人们经历了严重两极分化的时期
it became a really really polarizing time for a lot people in Hollywood

799
00:42:56,975 --> 00:43:00,179
有好多大会都说我是个骗子
we got a lot bit big meetings saying I was doubling carneys

800
00:43:00,613 --> 00:43:03,539
说我会摧毁电影工业和好多人的工作
I was going to destroy our industry, I was going to destroy our jobs

801
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:08,853
在影院里他们说：“他嘴上说《克隆人的进攻》是数字拍的，其实不是，
in theater that he said he shot <i>the attack of the clones<i> digitally, but he didn’t

802
00:43:08,854 --> 00:43:11,420
“我们听说他其实还是用胶片拍的，
we have the words that he actually used film cameras 

803
00:43:11,421 --> 00:43:14,531
“他没用数位拍摄，他欺骗了所有人。”
he’s not shooting digital, he’s lying to everybody

804
00:43:15,227 --> 00:43:19,128
在1920分辨率下，我觉得画质真的令人震惊
with 1900, I thought the images out there is truly appalling

805
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,390
就是影院品质
I think that was a cinematic camera at all

806
00:43:23,803 --> 00:43:29,608
早些年，我不觉得数位摄像（和胶片）一样
in early years, I didn’t feel digital capture or digital production was the same

807
00:43:29,609 --> 00:43:32,116
他们总说：看，能看出差别吗？
they would always say: see, if you can tell the difference?

808
00:43:32,475 --> 00:43:34,240
然后我说能
and I could tell the difference

809
00:43:34,847 --> 00:43:39,584
我们的F900并非为拍摄电影而设计
our first F900 wasn’t designed like a film camera

810
00:43:40,162 --> 00:43:42,902
不过乔治卢卡斯用它拍了《星战前传》后
of course George Lucas had it shoot <i>star wars<i> 

811
00:43:42,903 --> 00:43:45,920
就再也不打算用胶片拍电影了
like he wouldn’t shoot another film on film again

812
00:43:46,218 --> 00:43:49,515
这在好莱坞也获得了很多支持
and that created quite enough pro in Hollywood

813
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:52,399
数字技术和数字摄像机
digital technology and digital cameras

814
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,368
看起来像是一种对
looked like a threat to people’s existence in

815
00:43:57,369 --> 00:43:59,133
人们思考和工作方式的威胁
way of thinking and way of working

816
00:43:59,492 --> 00:44:00,793
电影制作是艺术
film making is an art

817
00:44:00,794 --> 00:44:04,368
对于传统的电影制作者来说
to the traditional film maker it looks like

818
00:44:04,576 --> 00:44:06,341
我们像是在糟蹋艺术
we were messing around with art

819
00:44:06,418 --> 00:44:09,437
他们说你为什么不思进取
and they said why you went backwards, you know what

820
00:44:09,658 --> 00:44:14,766
不过也有很多人说这是有必要的，是前进的必要环节
but it’s a lot said about the necessity, a link back be able to spring forward

821
00:44:14,767 --> 00:44:17,767
{\a6}天行者牧场，加利福尼亚

822
00:44:15,714 --> 00:44:19,058
10年前乔治卢卡斯把大家聚在一起
George Lucas putting up together everybody 10 years ago

823
00:44:19,059 --> 00:44:21,937
在旧金山的天行者牧场开了个会
what a conference he gave the ranch up in San Francisco

824
00:44:22,656 --> 00:44:29,251
澄清了一个事实
and went object of our roles about the idea that

825
00:44:29,443 --> 00:44:32,555
数字技术是不是会把电影摄制终结
digital will put an end to the old cinematography

826
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,016
他说这就是另一个工具而已
he point out that it’s just another tool

827
00:44:36,259 --> 00:44:37,280
而且这一点不错
and that’s true

828
00:44:37,281 --> 00:44:39,509
当人们看到了乔治卢卡斯的测试
when people saw George Lucas’s test

829
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,435
他们说，这可行不通
they said: that’s not gonna work

830
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:46,640
不过也有人想，我大概会在10年内接受它
it was the same sort of close mind that we’re gonna work 10 years to adopt that

831
00:44:46,641 --> 00:44:49,741
我得等等，有人上我就上，我上了大家就都上了
I was gonna wait a little, if someone followed I will be one, I will one and that will be entire

832
00:44:49,742 --> 00:44:51,646
我知道是时候了，总是这样的
I know the time is it, it always does

833
00:44:49,742 --> 00:44:52,742
{\a6}《墨西哥往事》片场，2003，设备：SONY F900

834
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:55,454
我知道这是某件大事的开端
I can tell this is gonna be the beginning of something big

835
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:57,265
而我想成为这件事的一部分
and I want to be there for that

836
00:44:57,266 --> 00:44:58,672
但是画面很烂啊
but the image sucked

837
00:44:58,673 --> 00:45:02,341
画面没那么差，就是不如胶片拍的好
the image wasn’t bad, but the image wasn’t as good as film

838
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:06,138
不过却可以让我做一些从没法完成的事
but it allowed me to do something you cannot ever done

839
00:45:06,138 --> 00:45:09,138
{\a6}罪恶之城，2005

840
00:45:08,507 --> 00:45:12,362
我想到了《罪恶之城》那本书，我知道该怎么做了
I picked it in my <i>sin city<i> book, and I know how to do it now

841
00:45:12,363 --> 00:45:14,034
我应该用数字拍摄
I got shoot this digital

842
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:16,115
可以就像漫画书里表现的那样
I can make it looks just like the book

843
00:45:16,116 --> 00:45:17,648
<i>夜晚如地狱般炎热<i>
<i>the night is hot as hell<i>

844
00:45:18,493 --> 00:45:20,351
<i>楼上有一位女神<i>
<i>upstairs there is a goddess<i>

845
00:45:21,003 --> 00:45:22,814
<i>她说她要我<i>
<i>she’s telling me she wants me<i>

846
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:25,400
如果不是数字摄像，《罪恶之城》不会存在
<i>sin city<i> will not exist if I didn’t choose digital film

847
00:45:25,401 --> 00:45:27,133
我甚至根本想不到去拍
I wouldn’t even thought to do it

848
00:45:28,194 --> 00:45:31,491
他们想要一些事情推动艺术形式的发展
they wish to do thing that push the art form

849
00:45:31,492 --> 00:45:34,417
技术推动艺术，而艺术也推动技术发展
technology push the art and art push technology

850
00:45:35,723 --> 00:45:37,952
《罪恶之城》的出现石破天惊
<i>sin city<i> came out hit people like break eggs

851
00:45:37,953 --> 00:45:40,042
他们不知道他们看的是什么
they have no idea what they are looking at

852
00:45:40,043 --> 00:45:43,711
他们想要在表面下的有些东西消失
something hiding from it under rock and hopes it goes away

853
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,890
你完成了一些人么认为不可能的事情
you end it up doing something that people didn’t realize was possible

854
00:45:49,235 --> 00:45:54,018
效果如此惊人，你知道一切皆有可能
it’s so amazed that which it had that knowing anything is possible

855
00:45:54,019 --> 00:45:57,919
这个系统有着你从没感受过的颜色广度
the system got better for color and you didn’t working of that color space

856
00:46:03,543 --> 00:46:07,583
电影经过了拍摄、剪辑和视觉特效合成后
after the movie is shot, edited and VFX being added

857
00:46:07,584 --> 00:46:12,367
色彩配光师会在实验室里继续调整电影的画面
the colorist or color timers in the lab make adjustment to the look of the movie

858
00:46:13,394 --> 00:46:15,623
在传统化学摄像法中
in the traditional photo chemical method

859
00:46:15,624 --> 00:46:18,456
底片要经过显影和印片
the negative is developed in print is made

860
00:46:19,312 --> 00:46:23,770
在黑白电影时代的配光
timing goes back to the days when there’s only black and white

861
00:46:19,312 --> 00:46:22,312
{\a6}唐 希亚那，特艺彩色配光师

862
00:46:23,771 --> 00:46:28,693
<i>这些画面展示了旧时实验室的暗房操作<i>
<i>these scenes showed the dark room operations of the laboratory in the old days<i>

863
00:46:28,694 --> 00:46:34,126
主要就是自己看底片
I had my job it’s looked at the negative and the side how long

864
00:46:34,127 --> 00:46:36,913
以及要在显影床里泡多长时间
it would have to stay in the beds

865
00:46:36,914 --> 00:46:38,826
<i>第一次如果不行…<i>
<i>if the first wasn’t right…<i>

866
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:41,065
那就继续泡
dunk, dunk again

867
00:46:41,066 --> 00:46:44,863
所以这就是配光跟时间的关系
so, it was time related

868
00:46:45,687 --> 00:46:47,637
随着彩色胶片的发明
with the advent of color film

869
00:46:47,637 --> 00:46:50,637
{\a6}绿野仙踪，1939

870
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:50,981
配光师的工作也变成更具创造性的过程
the timers became more involved into creative process

871
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:58,012
实验室里，色彩配光师、摄影指导和导演决定
at the lab, the color timer, DP, and director determine the look

872
00:46:58,013 --> 00:47:02,053
最后的印片样式，以在影院上映
for the final prints there will be seen by the public in the theaters

873
00:47:03,666 --> 00:47:06,452
化学摄像中唯一能做的调整是
the only adjustment that can make photo chemically

874
00:47:06,453 --> 00:47:11,375
红绿蓝三原色及亮度的整合
are color bands between red, green, blue and brightness

875
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:18,780
我们的工作就是达成导演和摄影想要的结果
our job basically is to achieve the vision of the director and the DP

876
00:47:15,363 --> 00:47:18,363
{\a6}泰瑞 海格，特艺彩色配光师

877
00:47:19,109 --> 00:47:21,570
并在胶片上实现
and make it happen on a piece of film

878
00:47:22,555 --> 00:47:25,248
我会和导演和摄影坐在一起
like I was sitting with the director and the DP

879
00:47:25,249 --> 00:47:28,499
他们会说这有点太红或太模糊或太蓝了
and they’ll say that is a little bit too red, too smear, too blue

880
00:47:28,922 --> 00:47:34,309
然后我们就在头脑中调整
and we will manipulated in our minds as how much to

881
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:39,743
怎么改变或做不同的对比度平衡
change it or to make different cuts balance with each othe

882
00:47:40,813 --> 00:47:42,345
胶片时代的配光
when the time was on the film

883
00:47:42,054 --> 00:47:46,664
基本上靠脑袋想然后用嘴说
they got to do it pretty much from the head by the tuition

884
00:47:46,664 --> 00:47:47,407
是么
yeah

885
00:47:47,408 --> 00:47:49,497
这很难的，非常难
it was hard, very hard

886
00:47:47,408 --> 00:47:50,408
{\a6}安德烈 巴克维亚，摄影
（非法入侵/生死时速/魔鬼代言人）

887
00:47:55,665 --> 00:47:56,665
所以为了做到要付出很多劳动和艺术心血
so in order to do this there were a lot of art and labor involved in it

888
00:47:55,666 --> 00:47:58,312
为了达到最后的效果，这些人很努力
these people really work hard to that, achieve that

889
00:47:59,578 --> 00:48:05,569
配光是个很令人沮丧的过程
I still found it very very frustrating that timing process

890
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:09,470
在片子播放的时候在不停的说，还要跟上剪辑的速度
you kind of talking over the thing while it’s running and trying to keep up with the cuts

891
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:12,470
{\a6}史蒂文 索德伯格，导演/摄影
（11罗汉/切格瓦拉/传染病）

892
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:12,311
然后还有些专业词汇
and saying that I don’t know it’s a little science to me

893
00:48:12,312 --> 00:48:15,609
他们就不停地把脚注写下来
something in the guys they are trying to write it down, write the footage down

894
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:20,576
这个过程一直就是这样，感觉很疯狂
as it goes on you can’t stop and that seems crazy

895
00:48:23,364 --> 00:48:27,776
数字色彩校正工具首先被使用到短片中
digital color correction tools were first to use for shorter pieces

896
00:48:27,777 --> 00:48:30,098
例如广告和音乐录像
such as commercials and music videos

897
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,420
在音乐录像中配光
basting time in music videos

898
00:48:32,421 --> 00:48:35,421
{\a6}史蒂凡 索纳菲德，DI配光师
（借刀杀人/斯巴达300勇士/爱丽丝漫游仙境）

899
00:48:32,421 --> 00:48:41,012
我们完成了最疯狂的和最具突破性的视觉体验
and we came up some of the craziest and ground breaking visual images

900
00:48:41,498 --> 00:48:46,095
而来到这样的一个房间
and it was just amazing ability to come to a room like this

901
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:52,365
制作人么从没见过的画面，本来就很神奇
and manipulate something to create images that people never seen before

902
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,340
数字色彩校正开始取代传统的化学摄像色彩配光
digital color correction began replacing traditional photo chemical methods of color timing

903
00:49:03,151 --> 00:49:06,151
{\a6}吉尔 博格丹诺维茨，DI配光师
（胡佛/老爷车/灵魂歌王）

904
00:49:03,151 --> 00:49:07,860
我的工作就是保证制作人能够达到他们想要的效果
my job is to be able to make sure the creatives get everything what they want

905
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:11,041
保证摄影得到他要的对比度
make sure the photographer gets the pilot of contrast that he wants

906
00:49:11,042 --> 00:49:14,000
保证导演想要的电影色调
and the director gets the feelings he wants around movie

907
00:49:14,001 --> 00:49:16,322
保证我们能看到演员的眼睛
make sure that we can see all actors eyes

908
00:49:16,323 --> 00:49:18,736
饱含他想要的感情
and see all the emotion that he wants to see

909
00:49:19,641 --> 00:49:23,217
现在我来建立一个我们说的能量窗
I can now start building what we call power window

910
00:49:23,218 --> 00:49:28,418
在这我可以做任何我想要的改动
in a power window I can change any kind of view I want

911
00:49:28,518 --> 00:49:32,180
比如左边的这些树
I just want these trees over on the left

912
00:49:32,181 --> 00:49:37,427
我可以改变它们的颜色
I can take the color that I want on those trees

913
00:49:37,428 --> 00:49:40,260
我能把它隔离出来
and I can isolate it

914
00:49:40,261 --> 00:49:44,765
接着就可以变成任何颜色了
now I can change those trees in any color I want

915
00:49:45,127 --> 00:49:48,982
导演和摄影会来和我们一起几周
the cinematographer and the director coming and we spend a couple of weeks

916
00:49:48,983 --> 00:49:51,983
{\a6}蒂姆 斯蒂潘，DI配光师
（黑天鹅/摔跤王/切格瓦拉）

917
00:49:48,983 --> 00:49:52,418
把电影调整到更好看
grading the film and give it that look make it look beautiful

918
00:49:52,419 --> 00:49:55,127
到他们想要的程度
however they want to look

919
00:49:55,128 --> 00:49:59,802
只要合理我都能做到，这种感觉很棒
I had a great feeling that I can do just about anything you asked me to do it in reason

920
00:49:59,803 --> 00:50:01,938
是谁发明了这个系统呢
who invented this process

921
00:50:01,939 --> 00:50:04,910
你知道曾经用在音乐录像上的技术吧
the same technology people used for music videos

922
00:50:04,911 --> 00:50:06,397
把画面变得很酷
create how cool it looks

923
00:50:06,398 --> 00:50:10,158
而现在的技术是过去的10年间发展起来的
and basically what happened was over last 10 years

924
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:13,223
只是更加进化并自由了
it just evolved and it becomes a lot more free mind

925
00:50:13,223 --> 00:50:16,223
{\a6}逃狱三王，2000

926
00:50:15,586 --> 00:50:18,373
这是第一部从头到尾
Over there were art that it was really the first movie

927
00:50:18,374 --> 00:50:21,113
使用特效配光的电影
where at basically that every single frame was the visual fact

928
00:50:21,114 --> 00:50:25,524
为了达到效果用数字技术配光
So its all color times digitally for the look

929
00:50:25,525 --> 00:50:31,004
所以这是第一部DI
So it’s a first DI. It’s just kind of…

930
00:50:31,005 --> 00:50:33,610
罗杰迪金斯（《逃狱三王》摄影）在这说：
Roger Deakins sit in the room and saying

931
00:50:33,611 --> 00:50:37,557
我不能用化学摄像法
I can’t get what I want in photo chemical

932
00:50:37,558 --> 00:50:38,672
因为每次我想要给配光成美丽的金色蓝天就全没了
Because every time I color time this nice golden color I lose my blue sky

933
00:50:38,673 --> 00:50:40,622
我该怎么办啊
what am I gonna do

934
00:50:40,623 --> 00:50:42,479
<i>有点太黄了是不是<i>
<i>it’s a little bit yellow isn’t it<i>

935
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,236
<i>应该更棕一点<i>
<i>should be sort of more brown<i>

936
00:50:46,237 --> 00:50:51,438
所以我跟他说
So he came in to testing actually I sat with him and showed him

937
00:50:51,439 --> 00:50:54,875
我们能做，我们能做到画面中的每个细节
Ok we can key it, what we do is we can basically affect everything in the image

938
00:50:54,876 --> 00:50:57,221
不过蓝天是不行了，因为这会毁掉其他的东西
except for the blue in the sky also they will ruin overalls

939
00:50:57,222 --> 00:51:00,936
所以蓝色就不能用了
so the blue’s in wardrobe

940
00:51:00,937 --> 00:51:02,608
不过其他的，像这些绿树如果不是你要的颜色
but everything else like the green trees that are not in pilot that you want

941
00:51:02,608 --> 00:51:02,700
我们可以把它调成棕黄色
we can exaggerate them in brown gold

942
00:51:06,213 --> 00:51:10,161
所以这部电影的画面很成功
so out of the successive look for the movie

943
00:51:10,162 --> 00:51:12,400
接着其他的人也跟进
and other people catching on and say

944
00:51:12,401 --> 00:51:15,003
“哇，我也可以试试那个”
woo, I can use that in

945
00:51:15,004 --> 00:51:18,572
接着（DI）就变得流行起来
it just became more and more popular

946
00:51:18,573 --> 00:51:21,350
化学摄像配光法真的很令人沮丧
timing is a very frustrating process on photo chemical

947
00:51:21,351 --> 00:51:24,284
很残酷而且也基本上干不了什么
it’s very cruelled, hardly to do anything

948
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:26,049
不过DI就不一样了
that’s a whole thing about DI

949
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:30,580
我可以圈出一个小东西，可以让一张脸更红
while I can go in to circle a little thing and make a face a little bit redder

950
00:51:30,597 --> 00:51:34,080
还可以隔离背景，简直是天堂啊
and bring out the background I was just in heaven

951
00:51:34,081 --> 00:51:36,960
太不可思议了，我可以做任何事来完成一部电影
it’s amazing I can do anything to success movie

952
00:51:36,961 --> 00:51:39,647
现在回想比较有趣的是
what I find interesting now looking back

953
00:51:39,648 --> 00:51:45,382
从我最初成为摄影师的时候开始
to the beginning of experimentation of as a cinematographer like myself

954
00:51:45,383 --> 00:51:48,383
{\a6}暖暖内含光，2004

955
00:51:45,383 --> 00:51:49,540
从电影诞生到数码世界
Going from a film original and the digital world

956
00:51:49,541 --> 00:51:54,693
我们一直在寻找能够控制画面并更具操控力的方法
Seeking more control of the image and being able to manipulate the image more

957
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:57,294
不过现在却是我们失去了更多控制
And now we actually have lost control

958
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:02,635
我们放弃了底片，也放弃了成品
Because we then give away our negative, give away our product

959
00:52:02,636 --> 00:52:06,257
能拿到的人都可以对其进行操作
Anybody can take it after that and can manipulate it

960
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:10,979
这是最后成品很重要的一个方面
(?)this cording is really an important aspect of the final product

961
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:15,502
我是把电影做成更好的样子
I’m the one that pushing these buttons to make your film look a certain way

962
00:52:15,503 --> 00:52:17,313
虽然我要接受指示
Yes I’m getting the direction but

963
00:52:17,314 --> 00:52:21,490
不过这需要很多自己的东西来承担这个责任
it’s a lot of my own confidence to crane that certain amount

964
00:52:21,491 --> 00:52:23,583
把它带领到一个正确的方向
And push that into a certain direction

965
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:27,577
所以我基本上是真正接触它的人
So I’m kind of like the last person who really gets the touch of it

966
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:31,705
摄影和配光师之间开始变得对抗
It started to become very adversarial between cinematographer and colorist

967
00:52:31,706 --> 00:52:35,838
因为他们都想“他不是决定电影画面的人，我才是”
because they were like “he shouldn’t be determining how the film looks like, I do that”

968
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,157
不过过程之美就在于这是个团队啊
the beauty of this process is it’s a team

969
00:52:39,158 --> 00:52:42,548
这有可能把DP的权利削弱
it could take the power away from the DP but I think it’s

970
00:52:42,549 --> 00:52:47,795
不过我认为作为摄影的工作就是尽量让拍出来的东西好看
your job as a cinematographer to try your best to see it through the eye

971
00:52:48,445 --> 00:52:52,114
他们会尽量控制DI
They will do everything to make sure they president the DI

972
00:52:52,115 --> 00:52:56,572
来实现他们所想的画面
And that will supervise that the dare vision they intend was executed

973
00:52:56,573 --> 00:52:59,573
{\a6}迈克尔 包豪斯，摄影
（纽约黑帮/好家伙/无间道风云）

974
00:52:56,573 --> 00:52:59,452
在《纽约黑帮》里，他们要我做DI
In <i>gangs of New York <i> they offer me to do a DI

975
00:52:59,453 --> 00:53:02,453
{\a6}纽约黑帮，2002

976
00:53:02,729 --> 00:53:06,676
因为每件事都已经准备好了
But because everything was built for us

977
00:53:06,677 --> 00:53:10,020
我们从大屏幕上看见的就是我们想要的
what we had on screen was exactly what we wanted

978
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:14,711
并不需要DI去改变什么
It didn’t have to have a DI to change everything

979
00:53:16,707 --> 00:53:19,261
我通常都是通过摄像机
but I’m trying always to do it in camera

980
00:53:19,281 --> 00:53:22,917
用光，滤镜和镜头来调整图像
and with lighting and with filters and lenses

981
00:53:22,918 --> 00:53:25,425
而不是拍完了用DI
But not later in the DI

982
00:53:25,426 --> 00:53:28,908
不过如果你有个特别的故事
OK, if you have a special story

983
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:32,020
需要你改变现实
when you need to change the reality

984
00:53:32,021 --> 00:53:34,109
那DI就的确是个好东西
Then the DI is something wonderful

985
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:37,174
因为你可以在画面上实现你想做的一切
because you can do whatever you want in the image

986
00:53:37,175 --> 00:53:39,729
这很不错
which can be great, which can be wonderful

987
00:53:41,406 --> 00:53:43,960
一旦电影数字化的拷贝完成了
Once we get done digitally clap cracking your movie

988
00:53:44,378 --> 00:53:47,629
我们会做一份全新的底片去印片
We make a brand new negative and then make a print of that negative

989
00:53:48,136 --> 00:53:52,176
然后我们会对比数字和印片
then we look at the print versus the data in the side by side fashion

990
00:53:57,647 --> 00:53:58,647
把印片和数字匹配
And we dealt in the print to match the data

991
00:53:58,826 --> 00:54:01,612
处理成需要的样子
To make the print exact the way it should

992
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:10,345
你对制作母片的工作有什么感觉
How do you feel about you do all these work to have a pristine

993
00:54:10,346 --> 00:54:14,943
有些印片很完美，有些就（不那么好）
and you got to have some prints perfect, and some prints…

994
00:54:14,944 --> 00:54:17,961
完成之后你能放得下么
Will you let it go once you created it?

995
00:54:17,962 --> 00:54:21,119
说实话去电影院的时候
honestly the truth of the fact is that when you go to a theater

996
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:24,323
你看到了几周心血的最终版
You watch that prints used to spend weeks of labor on

997
00:54:24,324 --> 00:54:26,413
其实每家影院都不一样
Every theater looks different

998
00:54:26,827 --> 00:54:30,125
放映机的光照强度不一样
They have the lumination on their projector in different level

999
00:54:30,126 --> 00:54:32,075
还有其他的许多原因
or other so many variables

1000
00:54:28,492 --> 00:54:36,982
我们真正担心的改变画面的东西实际上是放映机
The real alter alternatively from the picture we used to worry about is projections

1001
00:54:36,983 --> 00:54:38,468
声音可大可小
Sounds could be loud and low

1002
00:54:38,469 --> 00:54:40,743
演员的头可能看见也可能看不见
You can see the head of the actor or not

1003
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:43,065
因为放出框了，他们（放映员）挺忙的
Cause they can frame you out, cause they’re busy

1004
00:54:43,066 --> 00:54:44,350
总有事情要做
They got things to do

1005
00:54:45,567 --> 00:54:48,492
可能一卷胶片发蓝，另一卷发黄
film come up one reel be blue and another reel be brown

1006
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:50,118
都是因为放映机
because use the projector like

1007
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:53,090
我们曾经还挺享受这个，因为是电影的一部分嘛
we got to enjoy that because that’s the part of film

1008
00:54:53,091 --> 00:54:57,409
我看到印片总是失望
it’s always a huge disappointment for me to see a film print

1009
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:58,616
因为真是太让人郁闷了
because it’s depressing

1010
00:54:58,617 --> 00:55:02,006
一点也不清晰，没个分明的断点
it’s not sharp, it does not have any snap

1011
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:05,304
摇摇晃晃，脏兮兮，相当可恨
it’s shaking, it’s dirty, I hate it

1012
00:55:06,712 --> 00:55:09,266
我把它放大巨大的显示屏上
I put it in the tremendous monitor effort

1013
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:11,304
{\a6}乔司 维克诺，摄影
（潜艇风暴/全面回忆/星河战队）

1014
00:55:09,266 --> 00:55:14,189
就是为了我所想的影响成真
To make my images the way I have them in mind

1015
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:19,158
我为此制作它们，在摄像机上完成它们
And I create them; I have them on the finish product in the camera

1016
00:55:19,159 --> 00:55:21,248
不过看看后来呢
But what happens afterwards

1017
00:55:21,583 --> 00:55:23,580
影院里电影的质量真是不堪目睹
The quality of film is terrible at theater

1018
00:55:24,181 --> 00:55:25,760
每个好莱坞人都说：
And anybody in Hollywood they say:

1019
00:55:25,761 --> 00:55:27,664
“天啊，在摄像机上看着可不是这样啊”
“Oh, it’s not that of camera, no”

1020
00:55:27,665 --> 00:55:29,986
所以他们从来不去电影院，看看真正的影院放映是个什么样子
so they never go to a theater to see it in the real theater

1021
00:55:29,988 --> 00:55:35,234
《泰坦尼克号》播放的次数太多了，我们的印片实际已经散架了
<i>Titanic<i> plays so long in theaters we actually had our prints fell apart

1022
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,600
早些时候从放映机里掉出来摔碎了
They’d early just dropped out the projectors and in pieces

1023
00:55:39,523 --> 00:55:42,914
所以我们绞尽脑汁去获得更好的放映质量
So we were struggling of trying to get qualities in the theaters

1024
00:55:43,594 --> 00:55:46,751
事实是，如果使用数码放映
And out of that came the fact that if it was digital

1025
00:55:47,578 --> 00:55:51,408
那效果就很棒了，没有划痕，也不会被撕裂
You have a brilliant thing, you wouldn’t have to scratch it, you wouldn’t have to tear it

1026
00:55:51,409 --> 00:55:53,637
<i>…这部电影已经席卷了…<i>
<i>…the movie has been overwhelming…<i>

1027
00:55:53,638 --> 00:55:57,585
1999年，我们实现了数字放映《幽灵的威胁》
In 1999, we were able to project <i>phantom menace<i> digitally

1028
00:55:57,586 --> 00:56:00,600
2家在纽约，2家在洛杉矶
We have 2 theaters in New York, 2 theaters in LA

1029
00:56:00,862 --> 00:56:05,749
那是主流好莱坞电影第一次用数字放映
And that was the first time that major Hollywood movie projected digitally

1030
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:08,532
那时候全国也就40家（数字放映影院）
There were up to 40 there in this country

1031
00:56:09,495 --> 00:56:11,027
99年的时候
Just for in 99

1032
00:56:11,769 --> 00:56:16,878
2002年，有150家多点
By 2002, there were still over 150

1033
00:56:17,705 --> 00:56:20,166
不过已经落后了
The post flow was already there

1034
00:56:20,266 --> 00:56:21,195
全都数字化了
it is all digital

1035
00:56:21,428 --> 00:56:23,330
所以电影工业的其它也会跟进
And the rest of the industry was going there

1036
00:56:23,331 --> 00:56:27,883
声音已经数字化了，剪辑方式也是
Sound was already got there, Editorial was got there

1037
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:30,298
摄像机拖后腿了
The camera is lagging behind

1038
00:56:30,462 --> 00:56:33,462
{\a6}借刀杀人，2004

1039
00:56:33,718 --> 00:56:37,155
新的公司开始发展高清摄像机
New companies began to develop high definition cameras

1040
00:56:37,156 --> 00:56:40,313
其它的好莱坞电影也开始跟随卢卡斯脚步
And the other Hollywood films followed Lucas’s lead

1041
00:56:42,272 --> 00:56:45,615
迈克尔曼的《借刀杀人》使用了汤姆森蝰蛇
Michael Mann’s <i> Collateral<i> used the Thomson viper

1042
00:56:45,616 --> 00:56:50,027
这是一架在黑暗环境中优于胶片摄影机的高清摄像机
a HD camera that outperform film in shooting darker enviroments

1043
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
{\a6}设备：汤姆森蝰蛇，2004

1044
00:56:51,747 --> 00:56:53,698
迈克尔想要在夜里也能看见
Micheal wants to see into the night

1045
00:56:56,404 --> 00:56:59,404
{\a6}迪奥 毕博，摄影
（借刀杀人/绿灯侠/芝加哥）

1046
00:56:56,404 --> 00:57:02,074
对于数位摄像机来说这是大显身手的时间
and that point is really best time for digital cameras

1047
00:57:02,075 --> 00:57:08,105
把（摄像）边界推向数字摄像机所擅长的方面
twit up and pushed the boundry on what digital was capable of

1048
00:57:09,909 --> 00:57:11,952
《借刀杀人》有意思在哪
<i>Collateral<i> is interesting that

1049
00:57:12,249 --> 00:57:15,128
它看起来完全是我们所见的那种
it was suppose to look exactly the way it looks

1050
00:57:18,833 --> 00:57:22,037
室外的纽约在晚上不是黑的
The New York outside at night you don’t see black

1051
00:57:22,037 --> 00:57:26,091
你可以看见整个城市有
You see all around the city of

1052
00:57:26,093 --> 00:57:31,016
绿色，大红，紫色的光和天空的雾霭
Green, magenta, purple lights and haze in the sky 

1053
00:57:31,017 --> 00:57:32,687
你可以看见所有这些疯狂的颜色
you just see all these crazy colors

1054
00:57:32,688 --> 00:57:36,217
能够捕获这样的影像，只能用数位摄像机
the only way that capture them at that time was digitally

1055
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,972
现在都在说晚上照相的事
you got a lot of this on night talking on photography going now

1056
00:57:42,265 --> 00:57:45,739
不过就是用了不同感光度的CCD
this just using the different sensitivities of your CCD chips

1057
00:57:46,063 --> 00:57:49,128
晚上能够捕捉更多的紫外线
it seizes a little more UV spectrum

1058
00:57:49,129 --> 00:57:54,347
所以就鼓励电影人去拍不同的夜景
so you got film makers try to use that to give a different ascetic to night time lighting

1059
00:57:54,348 --> 00:57:58,201
不过对我来说这些还是和录像差不多
(?)but to me it’s still of all we’re telling the flame of video

1060
00:57:58,644 --> 00:58:02,824
蝰蛇摄像机的出现告诉我
the viper was the first camera that really told me that

1061
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,995
数码时代强劲崛起
the digital age was right jetting up in a tensity

1062
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,204
数位摄像机竞争将随即而至
I can see the foot race and the cameras coming

1063
00:58:11,766 --> 00:58:17,849
2005年，潘那维申，胶片摄像机制造的先驱
In 2005, Panavision, an established force in the film camera business

1064
00:58:17,850 --> 00:58:23,097
进行了对单传感器摄像机的一系列动作
Made a serial push into digital with large sensor of single chip camera

1065
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:26,069
我们开始将这视作一种真正的影片格式
We started looking at this as real format

1066
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:29,069
{\a6}鲍勃 哈维，潘纳维申全球市场部高级副总裁

1067
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:31,642
我们觉得最好是我们来设计一台
And we decided the best thing we can do is design

1068
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:34,661
我叫它“能用影带的胶片摄像机”
What I used to call it a film camera that takes tape

1069
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:38,569
然后我们开始着手于“创世”
And that’s when we started drawing up the <i>genesis<i>

1070
00:58:38,569 --> 00:58:41,569
{\a6}设备：潘纳维申 创世，2005

1071
00:58:39,787 --> 00:58:43,503
“创世”具有全幅45mm芯片
“Genesis” is a full frame, 45mm chip

1072
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:47,543
这可以使影像获得和胶片相似的景深
that allows depth of field very similar to film

1073
00:58:49,663 --> 00:58:52,635
而且可以使用我们的45mm镜头
And we can use all our 45mm lenses

1074
00:58:52,636 --> 00:58:55,422
总共有上千种
Which total for thousands, literally

1075
00:58:55,423 --> 00:58:58,921
我们和索尼合作
And we went to the work partner up to SONY on it

1076
00:58:58,922 --> 00:59:02,404
他们负责设计电器元件
they design the electronics and we put it together

1077
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:05,701
接着第一台被用于电影正片制作的
and we introduced the first full frame digital camera

1078
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,651
全幅摄像机就诞生了
For making feature films

1079
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:10,850
“创世”的画质超级高，因为潘那维申制造嘛
The “genesis” was high to hell because it’s from Panavision

1080
00:59:10,851 --> 00:59:14,054
还有潘那维申专用特级系统
And it was so designing A system for Panavision

1081
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:18,141
最好的是还能使用潘那维申的镜头
The good about it was it took Panavision lenses

1082
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:20,509
具有全幅传感器
It was with a 35mm sensor

1083
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:24,085
而“蝰蛇”的只是2/3寸传感器
While the viper used 2/3’’ sensor

1084
00:59:24,874 --> 00:59:27,874
{\a6}超人归来，2006

1085
00:59:24,874 --> 00:59:28,729
人们想获得和35mm胶片一样的感受
people wanted the same feel same look they got from 35mm

1086
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:30,401
“创世”能够做到
which caught what you got with “genesis”

1087
00:59:30,402 --> 00:59:32,909
而且画面超好
And it gave pretty good images

1088
00:59:32,910 --> 00:59:36,206
这是我们为电影制作精心设计的
We were very careful to design it for film crews

1089
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:40,339
要是说对比以前有什么变化
So the transition, if there’s going to be one

1090
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,032
那就是制作电影更加简便
Would be easy for the people making movies

1091
00:59:43,529 --> 00:59:47,955
迪恩塞姆勒因为《与狼共舞》获得了学院奖
Dean Semler who was academic award cinematographer, financer of <i>dance with wolves<i>

1092
00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:50,784
他在墨西哥拍摄《启示录》的时候
Shot <i> apocalypto<i> down in Mexico

1093
00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:51,090
{\a6}《启示录》片场，2006

1094
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:54,499
那的温度有100（华氏），湿度200
where the tempreture was 100 degrees and humility was 200

1095
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:57,378
而且基本没变化（不停工）
And never had a second of down time

1096
00:59:57,379 --> 00:59:59,236
他感觉这就和摄像机一样
He felt it was like a film camera

1097
01:00:01,747 --> 01:00:03,094
35磅重
It’s 35 ponds

1098
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:05,199
他妈的破机器有这么大
Fucking cameras this big

1099
01:00:05,845 --> 01:00:09,653
在顶上还有一个像胶卷盒的东西
And on the top of it, it looks like film magazine

1100
01:00:09,807 --> 01:00:11,419
录像机和机身连在一起
The recorder attached to it

1101
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:14,915
和胶卷盒一样
The same way the mag will attach at the top on the back

1102
01:00:14,916 --> 01:00:16,727
我想看看刚拍了什么
I want to see what we just got shot

1103
01:00:17,372 --> 01:00:18,951
能回放吗
does it a playback off that?

1104
01:00:18,952 --> 01:00:21,041
不能，就和底片一样
no, you never touch that like original negative

1105
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:22,295
我就直说了
so if you see I get straight

1106
01:00:22,296 --> 01:00:26,225
你和索尼在摄像机研发上花了几百万
you got to spend how many millions developing camera with SONY

1107
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:30,311
然后你告诉我不能回看
and I can’t play the HD back to look at it

1108
01:00:30,312 --> 01:00:31,379
因为这是底片吗？
because that’s the negative?

1109
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:34,380
{\a6}迈阿密风云，2006，数字拍摄

1110
01:00:32,526 --> 01:00:34,615
在06/07年的时候
where we were in those 06, 07

1111
01:00:34,616 --> 01:00:37,913
我们已经有了不错的色度和分辨率
we had the color space and the revolution

1112
01:00:37,914 --> 01:00:39,570
不过动态范围还不行
but we didn’t have the dynamic range

1113
01:00:37,914 --> 01:00:39,570
{\a6}*动态范围：亮度反差的范围*

1114
01:00:39,571 --> 01:00:42,464
所以取景的时候一定要小心
so we had to be careful on the sight

1115
01:00:42,541 --> 01:00:44,491
动态范围是硬伤
dynamic range is veto

1116
01:00:44,473 --> 01:00:47,204
对我来说动态范围比什么都总要
dynamic range is more important than anything to me

1117
01:00:47,205 --> 01:00:49,805
这也拖慢了我换数位摄像的进程
so that really me slow down to shoot digitally

1118
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:52,220
看看动态范围的事吧
if you have thought of the range

1119
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:55,378
要是黑与白本来的感觉是这样
if the dark and bright is felt like this

1120
01:00:55,379 --> 01:00:58,379
{\a6}潜艇风暴，1981，胶片拍摄

1121
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,253
要使用数位拍摄
as shoot in digital

1122
01:00:57,254 --> 01:00:59,390
就没有这么宽的范围了
you don’t have this wide range

1123
01:00:59,391 --> 01:01:02,873
填不满光亮和黑暗之间的空间
which fill the heights between the blacks and the lights

1124
01:01:03,063 --> 01:01:05,478
所以亮些的没有了
so whatever up here is cut off

1125
01:01:05,479 --> 01:01:07,707
暗些的也没有了
and whatever down there is also cut off

1126

（黑暗骑士/盗梦空间/记忆碎片）

1127
01:01:07,865 --> 01:01:12,834
我就是不知道它怎么能能让我达到想要的效果
I just don’t feel how it is allowed to enable me to do what I want to do

1128
01:01:12,834 --> 01:01:15,834
{\a6}数字拍摄

1129
01:01:12,873 --> 01:01:17,431
你不能指望5档过度曝光还能看到什么
you can’t overexpose by 5 stops and still have something in the image

1130
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:22,400
你也不能指望4档曝光不足还能看到些什么
you can’t underexpose it by 4 stops and still have traces in the image

1131
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:25,054
我觉得只能是一片空白
I think you’ll find plain in those areas

开始制作一架面向影院市场的数位摄像机
set out to create a new cinematic affordable digital camera

{\a6}吉姆 詹那德，RED数位电影创始人

1136
01:01:40,350 --> 01:01:45,643
数字对胶片不够尊重
digital wasn’t paying enough respect to film

1137
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:47,918
也不如胶片好
it wasn’t as good as film

1138
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,731
对我来说一切皆可更好
and to me everything in the world can and will be made better

1139
01:01:51,732 --> 01:01:54,192
就看何时何人了
the only question is when and by whom

1140
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:00,944
取代胶片的运动开始了
there was a technological movements towards the eventual replacement of film

{\a6}泰德 施洛维茨，RED数位电影

1142
01:02:01,597 --> 01:02:04,894
当时的现象就是，主流厂商
what was happening in some of the major manufactures

1143
01:02:04,895 --> 01:02:08,795
都想在做自己的HD摄像产品
is they were creating video level tools essentially HD tools

1144
01:02:08,796 --> 01:02:12,231
并试图将其推广到电影市场
and tried to push that into the cinema

1145
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:16,364
不过我们所看到的是这些产品都差很远
and what we saw was that it’s not any close to good enough

1146
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:20,869
我们想定一个很高的目标，那样才有意义
we want to set a high enough target so that was meaningful

1147
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:23,234
这就是RED的本质
that’s the nature of RED

01:02:23,235 --> 01:02:26,856
我们想把胶片送进养老院
we want to help to send the film to the retirement home

1149
01:02:26,857 --> 01:02:30,386
并用更好的来取代它
and have a few good about what took it place

1150
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:36,030
2007年，RED 1面世
in 2007, the RED 1 was available to the public

1151
01:02:38,102 --> 01:02:43,211
在这个时代里，数位摄像机可以拍摄比HD更高的像素
this new generation, digital cameras could now shoot more resolution than HD

1152
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:47,762
把像素数目从2K提高到4K
and increased pixels from 2k to 4k

1153
01:02:49,223 --> 01:02:53,915
当我看到RED的时候我想我真该给胶片打个电话：来认识下某人
when I saw the RED I really thought I should call the film on the phone and said: met someone

1154
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:57,954
因为我认为这就是未来
cause I really thought this is the future

1155
01:02:57,955 --> 01:03:00,955
{\a6}切格瓦拉，2008

1156
01:02:59,215 --> 01:03:03,069
无论分辨率、场景弧度还是看起来的感觉
the resolution, the curve, the way it saw like

1157
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:05,159
都是全新的
I just felt this is a new thing

1158
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:09,803
所以我坚持要用它来拍摄《切格瓦拉》
and I was insisted that we shoot <i>CHE<i> on it

1159
01:03:11,859 --> 01:03:16,689
数字技术在一开始很烂地球人都知道
digital at the beginning was really bad, everybody knew that

1160
01:03:16,689 --> 01:03:19,689
{\a6}维尔莫斯 齐格蒙德，摄影
（猎鹿人/激流四勇士/花村）

1161
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:23,219
这部比以前的要好
that kind of that camera which was better than previous ones

1162
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:27,538
至少便宜，但是还是不够好
at least it was cheaper, ok, but it’s not good enough

1163
01:03:27,943 --> 01:03:32,077
因为总是有经验不足的问题
actually there is a experience limitation of that

1164
01:03:33,072 --> 01:03:37,577
它的确存在问题，它打压了小厂竞争，它是台电脑
(?)it has problems, it crushed occasion of the mob, it’s a computer

1165
01:03:37,578 --> 01:03:42,161
但是RED不顾胶片摄像机的尸体曾经怎样
but then again RED ignored everything about normal film camera bodies

1166
01:03:42,162 --> 01:03:44,345
转而使用自己觉得正确的东西
and use what they thought was right

1167
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,925
最坏的情况也就是
even with the worst stories of being out

1168
01:03:47,925 --> 01:03:50,867
因为过热把所有东西上敷个冰袋
is that the heating had a ice pack on all that stuff

1169
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,198
不过我不在乎
none of that bother me

1170
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:55,588
因为得到的实在特别
because the get was so significant

1171
01:03:55,667 --> 01:04:00,450
很多天内都不用在100多度的情况下
in this case, not having to log film magazines up and down

1172
01:04:00,451 --> 01:04:03,515
用手把胶卷盒拿进拿出
this for days on hand in hundred degree

1173
01:04:03,516 --> 01:04:06,533
是不是能用闪存拍摄不重要
whether they are able to shoot on flash card

1174
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:09,181
换存储盒只要50秒
change magazines in 50 seconds

1175
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,874
这就已经是不错的冷却了
that alone was huge frost

1176
01:04:11,878 --> 01:04:14,242
也能让拍出的画面更好
it resulted in a better movie

1177
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:11,874
{\a6}*RED 1采用磁盘阵列或CF卡存储，相对胶卷和录像带拍摄时间大大延长*

1178
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:21,175
我很喜欢吉姆詹那德这次的设计，我喜欢他们公司的理念
I really love the Jim Jannard’s doing, I love what their company’s about 

1179
01:04:21,176 --> 01:04:25,308
我喜欢他们使用的技术，这不仅仅是
and I love the tech they took, that’s very much no holds barred like

1180
01:04:25,309 --> 01:04:29,906
“撸袖子大干一场爆眼球的什么东西”这样
let’s roll up our sleeves let’s get it in and up to our eyeballs, let’s figure this shit out

1181
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:32,700
{\a6}社交网络，2010

1182
01:04:30,911 --> 01:04:35,217
RED 1有9磅，加镜头14磅
RED 1 is 9 pounds when put up lens on it is 14 pounds

1183
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:40,279
拍《社交网络》的时候很多时候要拍那些小船
on <i>Social Network<i> I went too many seconds I got to shoot these tiny boats

1184
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:42,369
我觉得它们轻的就像薯片一样
and I think it’s like potato chips

1185
01:04:42,370 --> 01:04:48,824
所以我不能把30磅重的设备放到船顶的帆上
and I can’t add 30 pounds a camera out on this side sail top on this boat

1186
01:04:48,825 --> 01:04:50,774
然后他说：“好吧，你要我怎么做”
he said “ Ok what you want me to do”

1187
01:04:50,775 --> 01:04:53,748
我说：“你自己拿着，或者和别人搭伙
I said “you got to take one, you got to board out you got

1188
01:04:53,749 --> 01:04:55,746
不管怎样你要想出办法
whatever you got to do you have to figure out the way

1189
01:04:55,747 --> 01:04:58,625
给我个印第赛车版的RED 1”
you got to give me the indycar version of the RED 1”

1190
01:04:55,747 --> 01:04:58,625
{\a6}*印第赛车是美国的方程式赛车，相对重量较轻*

1191
01:04:59,156 --> 01:05:01,432
这是在周五
this was on Friday

1192
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,275
周日他就打电话给我说：
on Sunday, he called me and said:

1193
01:05:04,276 --> 01:05:08,780
“我用碳纤做了个机身，你什么时候来拿，就在我桌上”
“I made one of body in carbon fibers, when you can have about it, it’s on my desk”

1194
01:05:09,379 --> 01:05:13,327
然后用上的时候，这东西只有5磅半
and went down, and pick up to it and they were 5 and a half pounds

1195
01:05:13,575 --> 01:05:16,176
这在电影业中从未出现过
that never existed before for film cameras

1196
01:05:16,177 --> 01:05:19,845
这么快的回应
this sort of immediate calling responds

1197
01:05:20,175 --> 01:05:24,216
在电影制作人和摄像机制作人之间
between the people who are shooting and the people who are creating the cameras

1198
01:05:24,216 --> 01:05:27,216
{\a6}贫民窟的百万富翁，2008

1199
01:05:26,624 --> 01:05:29,782
我迫切的想要制作点充满新鲜空气的东西
I was desperate to make something that had all the fresh air in

1200
01:05:29,783 --> 01:05:32,615
尤其是你去印度孟买的时候
and cause when you go to India in Bombay especially

1201
01:05:32,616 --> 01:05:37,200
鲜活的生命气息扑面而来，对你狂叫着
it’s got life, it’s just coming screaming on you all the time in everywhere

1202
01:05:37,201 --> 01:05:41,280
丹尼激动的产生了一个想法，我们应该在剧本中
Danny come to an idea, rage, come to an idea of speed energy use

1203
01:05:41,281 --> 01:05:44,630
用到速度和活力的元素
and that’s what we need on the script

1204
01:05:44,631 --> 01:05:47,430
跑，对，这就是我们要在印度用的
and then running, that’s it, that’s we use in India

1205
01:05:47,431 --> 01:05:50,313
那真是世界上最神奇的地方
it’s just the most wonderful place of the world

1206
01:05:50,314 --> 01:05:55,283
我们想要制作一部与众不同的电影，如果摄像机能实现那一点的话
for a different kind film we wanted the camera would trying somehow catch a bit of that

1207
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:58,998
就是要找一部摄像机，任务明确了
it’s about finding camera, the task is there, it’s clear

1208
01:05:58,999 --> 01:06:05,453
我要做的就是用我狂妄自大又符合正统的经验去找到一件工具
my job is to find, with all my anarchic and conventional experience there, to find a tool

1209
01:06:05,453 --> 01:06:08,453
{\a6}设备：矽映 SI-2K，2007

1210
01:06:05,842 --> 01:06:09,232
像矽映SI-2K这样的摄像机
cameras like Silicon Imaging SI-2K

1211
01:06:09,233 --> 01:06:12,204
可以到达对于胶片摄像机和早期
have been able to go places and get shots that

1212
01:06:12,205 --> 01:06:17,127
高清摄像机非常难以到达的地点进行拍摄
would have been very difficult with film or earlier versions of HD cameras

1213
01:06:17,128 --> 01:06:20,730
这里有个电脑传感器在后面
it’s a sensor of computer back on it

1214
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:23,294
你想要把摄像机做的看起来像电脑一样吗
so do you make a computer look like a film camera?

1215
01:06:23,666 --> 01:06:29,006
或者你会把摄像机线拔掉，和笔记本连接在一起？
or do you say: “the hell of that, take this and ease that cable and connected into a laptop”

1216
01:06:29,007 --> 01:06:31,387
这就是SI摄像机的本事
and that will be the SI camera was

1217
01:06:31,388 --> 01:06:34,348
单凭这点世界上还没有如此之小的摄像机能够做到
at that point no one camera in the world is small enough

1218
01:06:34,348 --> 01:06:37,348
{\a6}阿里 普莱斯勒，矽映总裁

1219
01:06:34,349 --> 01:06:39,642
安东尼想要在大街上追着孩子们跑
Anthony wanted to run into the streets and track the children as they were running

1220
01:06:39,643 --> 01:06:43,032
还得是和小孩一样的高度
and be as the same height level as the kids

1221
01:06:43,033 --> 01:06:48,101
所以他们把笔记本带上装包里
so they took macbook pros and put them into a bag pack

1222
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:52,022
用作捕获和记录的系统
to use for their capture and recording system

1223
01:06:53,184 --> 01:06:58,849
胶片摄像机，就算从稳固架或起重机上卸下来
film cameras, even when off the legs or off the steadicam or off the crane

1224
01:06:58,850 --> 01:07:00,893
还是要和摄影者的身体连接在一起
still connected on the camera man’s body

1225
01:07:00,894 --> 01:07:03,633
他或者就这么追着你跑
he’s either chasing you down the street

1226
01:07:03,634 --> 01:07:07,162
或者把东西架在这然后转身带着那一大堆东西回来
or he’s got it here, or he turns round and runs back with things like that

1227
01:07:07,163 --> 01:07:09,484
不过用SI-2K就动能做到
with this SI-2K you can do that

1228
01:07:11,849 --> 01:07:13,985
因为它不再连着摄影者的身体了
it’s no longer connected to the camera man’s body

1229
01:07:13,986 --> 01:07:15,563
你能做好多其他的事
you can do different things with that

1230
01:07:15,564 --> 01:07:19,500
在片场可以真正做到“自由发挥”
during the scene it’s just literally improvising

1231
01:07:26,364 --> 01:07:32,819
2009年，《平民窟的百万富翁》获得了最佳摄影学院奖
in 2009, <i>slum dog millionaire<i> won the academic award for best cinematography

1232
01:07:33,308 --> 01:07:39,075
这是该奖项第一次颁发给几乎全程使用数字拍摄的电影
it was the first time that award was giving to a movie shot almost entirely on digital camera

1233
01:07:39,342 --> 01:07:41,106
所以既然您获得了学院奖
so you had the academic award

1234
01:07:41,107 --> 01:07:47,562
您觉得数字拍摄是否已经被主流接受了呢
so do you feel like that the film make digital be accepted by the main stream now?

1235
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:51,185
《贫民窟》在评论界和观众当中的成功
the success of the <i>slum dog<i > with critics and audience

1236
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:55,044
代表了一个时代的某些特点
symbolizes something of an époque

1237
01:07:55,045 --> 01:08:00,271
也算是为数字拍摄打定了基础
it perhaps puts hammers and stakes a little bit in the ground

1238
01:08:00,272 --> 01:08:03,682
这样看来数字格式已经被接受了
this far was acceptance of digital format

1239
01:08:03,683 --> 01:08:06,659
这是第一个对大规模使用数字技术的奖项
it was the first really acknowledgement on the large scale of digital

1240
01:08:06,918 --> 01:08:09,286
为此我非常为安东尼高兴
I was very pleased for Anthony for that

1241
01:08:09,287 --> 01:08:13,559
因为我以为他会觉得他永远也不能拿到这个奖
because I think he felt it was some acknowledgement he would never arrive at

1242
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:16,902
因为他是如此特立独行于数码世界
because he’s chosen to specialized too much in the digital world

1243
01:08:16,903 --> 01:08:20,210
不过现在他的成就改变了所有人的看法
I think that was where he goes and everybody changed

1244
01:08:20,211 --> 01:08:23,211
{\a6}公众之敌，2009
设备：SONY F23

1245
01:08:23,212 --> 01:08:26,212
{\a6}第9区，2009
设备：SONY F23

1246
01:08:26,213 --> 01:08:29,213
{\a6}泰特罗，2009
设备：SONY F23

1247

{\a6}告密者，2009
设备：RED 1

1248
01:08:32,215 --> 01:08:35,215
{\a6}阿凡达，2009
设备：SONY F950

1249
01:08:35,108 --> 01:08:37,430
《阿凡达》本来是我在《泰坦尼克号》之后的下一部电影
<i>avatar<i> was gonna be my next movie after <i>titanic<i>

1250
01:08:37,431 --> 01:08:40,310
所以在99年的时候我想把它拍成3D的
so I converted to think about it shoot in 3D in ‘99

1251
01:08:40,853 --> 01:08:46,101
我立刻就想到能在未来拍摄3D的唯一方法就是数字拍摄
I knew immediately that the only way to shoot 3D, the future of shooting 3D is digital

1252
01:08:46,682 --> 01:08:50,351
我们做了个实验，我们把2部高清摄影机并排放在一块
we’re starting to an experiment, we took 2 HD cameras side by side

1253
01:08:50,766 --> 01:08:52,716
我觉得结果还是相当酷的
I thought the result was pretty cool

1254
01:08:53,538 --> 01:08:56,610
接着我就和佩斯合作建立起了自己的摄像系统
then with Pace I built the vision camera system

1255
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,690
一台摄像机放在这，另一台放到顶端
we’ve decided to put one camera here and another camera on top

1256
01:09:05,104 --> 01:09:08,819
那应该怎么整合这两个呢
so what happened in here to marry this two

1257
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:12,130
因为从观测上说是需要两个画面的对吧？
cause there scopicly you need two images exist right?

1258
01:09:12,131 --> 01:09:13,125
没错
correct

1259
01:09:13,496 --> 01:09:16,692
我们有一个问题就是在摄像机较大的时候
one of the problems we have was the larger camera is a fact

1260
01:09:16,693 --> 01:09:19,943
我们不能像我们两眼位置一样把他们并排放置
that we wouldn’t put them side by side like your 2 eyeballs, right

1261
01:09:18,178 --> 01:09:21,178
{\a6}文森 佩斯，卡佩3D技术CEO

1262
01:09:19,944 --> 01:09:23,240
你不能在现实世界把两架摄影机这么放
you couldn’t put those cameras physically in that position

1263
01:09:23,241 --> 01:09:25,230
他们会撞到的
they will run in to each other

1264
01:09:25,231 --> 01:09:28,302
所以我们利用镜面反射
so we use reflect of a mirror

1265
01:09:28,997 --> 01:09:33,362
这样在你的脑海里
and then that allows us to overlaid the 2 camera systems

1266
01:09:33,363 --> 01:09:35,637
两架摄影机的实际位置可以重叠
of your imagine form a physical stand point

1267
01:09:35,638 --> 01:09:39,600
而这样就不再有两眼间距离的限制
where there is no limitation how close we get these eyes together

1268
01:09:39,601 --> 01:09:42,697
而这一点对3D来说是非常重要的
and that’s really important to 3D

1269
01:09:43,535 --> 01:09:45,299
要制作3D效果
to create 3D

1270
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:49,247
两架摄影机要像两只眼睛一样
2 cameras works a pair just like our 2 eyes

1271
01:09:49,248 --> 01:09:52,590
从稍微不同的角度获取画面
they capture pictures from slightly different angle

1272
01:09:52,591 --> 01:09:56,259
从而制造三维空间的深度和广度
providing the sense in 3 dimensional depth and distance

1273
01:09:56,260 --> 01:09:58,720
我有个圈内笑话
I have a joke of most people all around me

1274
01:09:58,721 --> 01:10:00,510
我属于平面世界
I long for when the world was flat

1275
01:10:00,511 --> 01:10:03,800
因为不止适应系统要互相复制
because it’s not only the cameras system duplicated

1276
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,600
制作流程上的每件事都要相互复制
everything duplicates down the chain, right

1277
01:10:06,601 --> 01:10:09,108
一个镜头控制另一个镜头
so lensing control over lensing

1278
01:10:09,608 --> 01:10:13,060
很多人说这要加倍的难搞，实际上不对
and a lot people said that’s as twice as hard than that’s incorrect statement

1279
01:10:13,061 --> 01:10:14,330
不止是这样
that’s more than that

1280
01:10:14,331 --> 01:10:17,642
因为两架摄影机要像完全分不出来的双胞胎那样工作
because these 2 cameras have to operate like sign-missed twins

1281
01:10:17,643 --> 01:10:20,010
他们必须完美的复制对方
they have to mimic each other perfectly

1282
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,715
如果电影制作完成一切正常的话
I think when films are done right and when it really works is when

1283
01:10:25,716 --> 01:10:29,500
你会觉得身临其境，自己就在那个旅程之中，完全沉浸于故事里
you feels I’m there, I’m in this journey and immerged the story line

1284
01:10:29,501 --> 01:10:34,321
对我来说最有趣的地方在于把这个工具交给真正的创造之手
the fun part for me is to really get this tools in the creative hands

1285
01:10:34,322 --> 01:10:38,269
这样就有人带你去你从未想象过的地方了
so people can really take you to place that you never imagine before

1286
01:10:39,403 --> 01:10:43,583
《阿凡达》出来的时候我真的很骄傲于它的画面，太棒了
<i>Avatar<i> came out and I was really proud of those images, look gorgeous

1287
01:10:44,484 --> 01:10:48,756
紧接着《爱丽丝梦游仙境》和《驯龙高手》也上映了
and it was followed up by <i>Alice to wonderland<i> and <i>how to train your dragon<i>

1288
01:10:48,990 --> 01:10:53,726
邦邦邦，市场上接二连三出现了3部3D电影
boo boo boo, 3 movies on the markets one after another and all of them were (?)

1289
01:10:53,834 --> 01:10:56,156
而且都是年度票房大户
the 3 of them were the top grossing films of the year

1290
01:10:56,157 --> 01:11:01,266
所以突然间大门敞开了
so all of a sudden the door just blow wide open on the whole thing

1291
01:11:01,267 --> 01:11:05,260
人们看到了这里的市场前景
people really saw the potential of this as a market

1292
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:08,923
电影消费提升了观众
this consumptions of films has increased our audiences

1293
01:11:08,924 --> 01:11:11,857
的观影品味和理解能力
both appetite for them and now knowledge of them

1294
01:11:11,858 --> 01:11:14,644
所以想要制作惊人之作越来越难了
so therefore it’s getting harder and harder to impress

1295
01:11:15,206 --> 01:11:17,621
这就是3D为什么这么流行的原因之一
it’s one of the reasons why 3D’s taking off

1296
01:11:17,622 --> 01:11:20,407
换个口味看电影而已
just a way looking at a film

1297
01:11:20,408 --> 01:11:24,679
演员如同一尊雕塑，就是会走会动呼之欲出
the actor is like a sculpture or something only it’s moving and comes out

1298
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:28,582
就像从剧院到电影，从无声到有声之类的一样
and like a combination when theater went film, music and everything

1299
01:11:29,628 --> 01:11:33,482
我恨3D，我带上了眼镜会觉得反胃
I hate 3D, I put on those glasses and I get sick in my stomach

1300
01:11:33,483 --> 01:11:35,665
黑的什么也看不清
it’s too dark looking through them

1301
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:39,937
整个的3D现象实际上就是他妈的市场炒作难道不是吗？
the whole 3D phenomenon is a marketing fucking scheme isn’t it?

1302
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:41,532
作为一个旁观者我可以肯定的说
I can safely say as a viewer

1303
01:11:41,533 --> 01:11:43,483
我完全不感兴趣
I’m totally uninterested in it

1304
01:11:43,484 --> 01:11:45,990
丁点兴趣也没有
I’m without any interests whatsoever

1305
01:11:45,991 --> 01:11:47,244
我觉得这就是一时火爆
I think it’s a fad

1306
01:11:47,245 --> 01:11:48,777
早晚烧个精光
I think it will burn out

1307
01:11:48,778 --> 01:11:52,167
电影工作室把什么都做成3D是不明智的
the studio’s not wise to slap 3D on everything

1308
01:11:52,893 --> 01:11:56,423
《阿凡达》之所以做成3D是有原因的
with <i>Avatar<i> there is a reason this movie is in 3D

1309
01:11:57,033 --> 01:11:59,450
它要给你一种体验
because it’s taking you on an experience

1310
01:11:59,451 --> 01:12:05,350
不是为了赚钱、哗众取宠或者玩把戏
it isn’t something that was on for money or a joke or a gimmick

1311
01:12:06,158 --> 01:12:09,780
因为它是被创作成那个样子的
it’s there because it was created that way

1312
01:12:10,973 --> 01:12:13,992
《阿凡达》结合了两种完全不同的电影制作方式
<i>Avatar<i> is 2 completed different forms of film making combine

1313
01:12:13,993 --> 01:12:16,314
我们只实际拍摄了1/3的内容
we only use lenses for about 1/3 of the movement

1314
01:12:16,315 --> 01:12:19,240
都是普通的东西
it all sets in just normal stuff

1315
01:12:19,241 --> 01:12:21,128
灯光，布景，拍5场
(?)lighting, mural, 5 action

1316
01:12:21,453 --> 01:12:24,332
其余的2/3是特效
it was virtual FX to the other 2/3

1317
01:12:25,882 --> 01:12:28,434
我们从来没去真的丛林，我们创造了一个丛林
we never shot a real jungle, we have create a jungle

1318
01:12:28,435 --> 01:12:29,736
都是建模
it’s all peer modeling

1319
01:12:29,737 --> 01:12:32,848
每个草叶每只蹦来蹦去的虫子
every blade of grass, every bug bouncing around

1320
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:37,074
没有一个是真实丛林的场景
not one foot film shot in a real jungle

1321
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:43,897
数学建模能完美创造真实世界
you have this idea that you could hold a mathematically perfect model for creating reality

1322
01:12:43,898 --> 01:12:47,520
只要计算机和软件就好
you just threw on the computing power at it, you just put software on it

1323
01:12:47,589 --> 01:12:50,004
我们就是这么干的，我们要求
cause it’s all we found, we required

1324
01:12:50,005 --> 01:12:55,577
艺术家和摄影师研究光在物体上如何反射
artist and people who trained in photography looking at how light interact with those things

1325
01:12:55,578 --> 01:12:59,014
然后以此为基础写代码，创造一个看起来很逼真的世界
to figure out how to write the code, to make it look real

1326
01:12:59,378 --> 01:13:03,850
数字操控带给眼睛的幻觉
what I find was that the manipulations the digital made your eyes to do

1327
01:13:04,863 --> 01:13:08,020
的确很引人入胜但却很空洞
they are all seductive but alternately a little bit hollow

1328
01:13:08,021 --> 01:13:10,993
我常用的一个比喻是我想起有个夏天
the analogy I used t use was I remember the summer when

1329
01:13:10,994 --> 01:13:15,986
玉米油可以让巧克力饼干很软
chips oil give these chocolate cookies (?) soft

1330
01:13:15,987 --> 01:13:18,215
这很不错啊，让饼干变软
that’s amazing, just soft cookie and

1331
01:13:18,216 --> 01:13:19,955
不过几个月过后
and then after a couple of months

1332
01:13:19,956 --> 01:13:23,392
在上面的完全是一坨化学XX
what’s on it is some horrible chemical crap

1333
01:13:23,393 --> 01:13:26,434
开始只是给了你美好的幻想
give you bad illusion it fooled you first

1334
01:13:26,435 --> 01:13:30,382
我所担心的是现在大规模使用CGI
my concern is that the image alternately with CGI

1335
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:35,068
我们的年轻人也许不会再相信电影荧幕上的任何东西了
I don’t know the younger generation is believing anything anymore on screen

1336
01:13:35,489 --> 01:13:37,254
都不是真实的
it’s not real

1337
01:13:37,255 --> 01:13:42,455
你呈现了一个感觉真实却完全不是真实的世界
you are presenting complete unreality and make them feel like it was real

1338
01:13:42,456 --> 01:13:45,473
甚至都先于拍摄任何真实场景…
and before it was captured in reality…

1339
01:13:45,474 --> 01:13:49,792
好吧，你也进过不少片场吧
alright, you’ve been on a couple of movie sets

1340
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:51,973
真实过吗
when was it ever real?

1341
01:13:51,974 --> 01:13:54,573
一堵墙，什么也没有
there was a kind of wall, there is nothing over there

1342
01:13:54,574 --> 01:13:56,240
30个人忙忙碌碌
there were 30 people stand around

1343
01:13:56,241 --> 01:13:59,961
一个拿着麦克风，一个在梯子上的人把屁股沟露出来了(=  =)
a guy with a boom mic, the other guy upon a ladder with his ass crack hanging out

1344
01:13:59,962 --> 01:14:06,399
还有个起重机，纽约的夜晚可能是伯班克的白天
there is a sit crane, your street night exterior New York was a day exterior Burbank

1345
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,513
哪里真实了？
what was it ever real

1346
01:14:07,514 --> 01:14:10,514
{\a6}极速赛车手，2008

1347
01:14:09,806 --> 01:14:15,240
在老的拍摄技法中我们更为灵活
we are free of the old technology of capturing images

1348
01:14:15,241 --> 01:14:19,327
摄像机，胶片，镜头，曝光
camera, film, lens, exposure

1349
01:14:19,328 --> 01:14:23,878
我能掌控很多，有更多选择，更多点子
it give me more control, more choice, more wits

1350
01:14:23,879 --> 01:14:27,500
去达成脑中的想象
to access what you are imagining in your head

特效分解

1352
01:14:29,869 --> 01:14:32,469
电脑技术只能越来越好
computers will only get better and better

1353
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:36,463
你能够把任何东西创造的足够真实
will be able to produce anything you want completely realistic

1354
01:14:36,962 --> 01:14:42,860
而且换个想法，如果时间足够，你也可以融入到那个世界
and alternately, if you got enough time, the world is all yours there

{\a6}守望者，2009

1359
01:14:49,247 --> 01:14:52,497
你要抓紧学习抓住自己的想象
you have to try to outpace study and seize your imagination

1360
01:14:52,798 --> 01:14:57,234
做出人们从没见过的东西，而这样的东西一年比一年更真实
do something they haven’t seen before and every year it getting more and more real

1361

艺术家和电影制作者在不断提升画面的内涵、视觉效果和真实性
the artiest and the film maker are constantly trying to up the immanence spectacle and realism

1363
01:15:05,814 --> 01:15:09,504
所以现在的情况是从来没出现过的
so that really put this in a positions of like never before

1364
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:12,801
同时拓宽了艺术和技术
really having to wide technology and art

1365
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,461
数字技术真的很厉害
that was great about the digital technology

1366
01:15:18,462 --> 01:15:21,619
一两年内就可能再上一个新台阶
it should doubled in everything in one or two years

1367
01:15:23,078 --> 01:15:25,632
你想做什么只要想好
once you set your mind on that path

1368
01:15:25,633 --> 01:15:28,883
一切变的容易，不过是时间的问题
it all becomes very simple, it just be a matter of time

1369
01:15:28,884 --> 01:15:31,025
因为数字技术在不断进步
cause digital is gonna continue to improve

1370
01:15:31,336 --> 01:15:34,819
摄像机公司像RED，阿莱，索尼和其他的
camera companys like RED, ARRI, SONY and others

1371
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:38,668
在不断改进自己的商品
are constantly developing new products continue to make advances

1372
01:15:38,669 --> 01:15:42,012
让它们在动态范围、分辨率和颜色上有更好表现
on dynamic range, resolution and color

1373
01:15:42,994 --> 01:15:45,800
我喜欢看这些厂商竞争
I love that all these manufactures are competing against each other

1374
01:15:45,801 --> 01:15:51,721
把大摄像机做的更小，更快，更便宜，传感更好
to make big cameras smaller, faster and cheaper, better sensored

1375
01:15:52,134 --> 01:15:54,270
最近数位摄像机的
with dynamic range of digital camera

1376
01:15:54,271 --> 01:15:57,839
动态范围卡在10档
up until recently have been limited to really match to 10 stop

{\a6}设备：RED EPIC

1378
01:15:59,333 --> 01:16:03,605
不过在EPIC或ALEXA上你不用担心这个问题
but you don’t see that problem in the EPIC or the ALEXA

1379
01:16:02,107 --> 01:16:05,107
{\a6}设备：阿莱 ALEXA

1380
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,715
数位摄像机的动态范围已经比原来好多了
the dynamic range was much better when I was use to with digital

1381
01:16:08,184 --> 01:16:11,899
90年代中期的时候，阿莱生产的还全是化学照相摄像机
up untill the mid-90s, for ARRI, it was all photo chemical

当我觉得数字技术已经成熟
we solve the digital technology mature to a point that were

1384
01:16:15,286 --> 01:16:17,792
我们也开始发展自己的数字摄像机
we began and invite the digital technology

1385
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:20,950
我们用在ALEXA上的传感器
the sensor that we used now on the ALEXA camara

{\a6}设备：阿莱 ALEXA，2010

1387
01:16:20,951 --> 01:16:25,981
让我们骄傲的说，其拍摄质量足以制作电影正片
allowed us to offer a camera that we can proudly promote as a feature film camera

1388
01:16:26,349 --> 01:16:29,135
ALEXA拥有所有令我们兴奋的元素
the ALEXA takes all of that we are excited about

1389
01:16:29,136 --> 01:16:33,501
在电影制作中可以带来胶片具有的质感
in film making and brings those textural qualities that film has

1390
01:16:33,502 --> 01:16:35,766
及熟悉的色彩表现
brings that definitely familiar color space

1391
01:16:35,767 --> 01:16:40,736
最近我才对ALEXA感兴趣，因为他是阿莱的新产品
and only recently I’m realy interested in ALEXA made by Arriflex not heard

1392
01:16:40,897 --> 01:16:44,845
而且和用胶片拍摄没什么不同
that it’s like shooting film with digital format

1393
01:16:44,846 --> 01:16:47,677
非要我使用数字拍摄的话
if I’m push to shoot on digital

1394
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:52,094
我会用ALEXA，因为可以得到很好的效果
I will take the ALEXA and that could help me get good result

1395
01:16:49,215 --> 01:16:52,215
{\a6}雨果，2011
设备：阿莱ALEXA

1396
01:16:52,216 --> 01:16:55,216
{\a6}亡命驾驶，2011
设备：阿莱ALEXA

1397
01:16:55,217 --> 01:16:57,217
{\a6}忧郁症，2011
设备：阿莱ALEXA

1398
01:16:57,218 --> 01:16:59,218
{\a6}时间规划局，2011
设备：阿莱ALEXA

1399
01:16:59,630 --> 01:17:01,906
这是RED的新产品，我们叫它EPIC
this is the new RED, we just call it EPIC, so

1400
01:17:01,907 --> 01:17:07,479
信不信由你，可是比RED 1提高了60%的像素
this is, believe it or not, 60% more resolution than the RED 1

1401
01:17:09,717 --> 01:17:11,899
吉姆詹那德给我看他的新产品EPIC
when Jim Jannard showed me the EPIC

1402
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:13,432
我看着它说：“等等，
I looked at it and I said: “ wait a minute

1403
01:17:13,450 --> 01:17:15,104
“这个能干什么？
“what did that do?

1404
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:18,715
“能怎么帮助你将故事？”
“how could that free you as a story teller”

1405
01:17:18,716 --> 01:17:21,716
{\a6}龙纹身的女孩，2011
设备：RED EPIC

1406
01:17:23,226 --> 01:17:26,226
{\a6}超凡蜘蛛侠，2012
设备：RED EPIC

1407
01:17:23,226 --> 01:17:25,548
它能拍摄非常美丽、丰富、
this camera created those beautiful, rich,

1408
01:17:25,549 --> 01:17:29,449
自然或者说格调独特的颜色
very natural or very stylisticly wonderful colors

1409
01:17:26,837 --> 01:17:29,837
{\a6}霍比特人，2012
设备：RED EPIC

1410
01:17:31,093 --> 01:17:36,387
我们要用分辨率4K的放映机在超大屏幕上放映
we’ve taken a digitally projective 4k images on a gigantic screen

1411
01:17:36,556 --> 01:17:38,738
那效果一定震人心魄
and it is absolutely mind-blowing

1412
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,086
影院的运输方式要改变了
the delivery system of cinema is going to change

1413
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:51,795
这比摄影机本身更令我兴奋
and that’s actually more exciting a way for me beside the actual camera

1414
01:17:52,715 --> 01:17:55,780
因为那种老掉牙的一套：
cause the ancient system of

1415
01:17:55,900 --> 01:18:00,496
送电影上卡车，到不同的城市，再卸货
film on a truck driving into a city and unloading it

1416
01:18:00,497 --> 01:18:01,936
要被取代了
that being replaced

1417
01:18:02,392 --> 01:18:08,197
运送巨大的胶卷铁盒子到处跑是相当费钱的
the old way of having ship giant film case around is very very expensive

1418
01:18:09,409 --> 01:18:15,540
所以人们意识到如果使用数字放映
so the business realized that there was a tremendous possible savings

1419
01:18:15,541 --> 01:18:18,936
可以省一大笔钱
in digital delivery and digital projection

1420
01:18:20,336 --> 01:18:24,701
我们都想要母片，底片的第一版
we are all want the pristine print, first print of all the negative

1421
01:18:24,702 --> 01:18:26,326
不过这不可能
but we cannot have that

1422
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:27,534
你必须拷贝
so you have to copy it

1423
01:18:27,610 --> 01:18:30,820
但是用数字放映就没必要拷贝了
and the advance of DCP is not real copying

1424
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:33,525
扫描完成后不需要复印
once it scanned, it doesn’t get copied again

1425
01:18:33,882 --> 01:18:36,436
更像是克隆，完全一样的东西
it’s cloned, so it’s exactly the same thing

1426
01:18:37,672 --> 01:18:40,041
我对数字放映机更有好感
I’m getting more impressed with digital projection

1427
01:18:40,042 --> 01:18:44,313
我不是技术帝
as much as…I’m not big on technology

1428
01:18:44,314 --> 01:18:47,007
但我觉得数字放映机的发展前景是极好的
I think digital projections will come a long way 

1429
01:18:47,008 --> 01:18:53,787
过去的两年我们卖了10000台数字放映机到影院
in the last 2 years we’ve sold 10,000 digital projectors into cinemas

1430
01:18:54,398 --> 01:18:57,138
全球都在换
the conversion is taking place globally

1431
01:18:57,139 --> 01:19:00,807
现在我们已经完成了50%
we were probably 50% or more there

1432
01:19:00,808 --> 01:19:03,825
剩下的很快就会完成
and the rest of the conversion will happen very quickly

1433
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,811
既然令人惊叹的电影已经制作出来
they produce gorgeous pictures

1434
01:19:05,812 --> 01:19:08,310
那么我们就必须创造更好的表现方式
and you had to study building up a wave

1435
01:19:08,311 --> 01:19:12,777
所以我们要让数字屏幕在2015年达到200000块
that’s why we’re gonna up to 200,000 digital screens by 2015

1436
01:19:14,957 --> 01:19:20,948
传统的印片方式岌岌可危
the model for printing film is endangered

1437
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:26,839
但我不希望最终胶片也是这样
and ultimately I hope that it doesn’t take film with it

1438
01:19:29,732 --> 01:19:32,091
小时候去看电影
as a kid, I went to the movies

1439
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:35,249
坐下后看到红色的幕帘
you sat down and looked at a big red curtain

1440
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:37,199
接着幕帘拉开
and then that curtain parted

1441
01:19:39,475 --> 01:19:42,587
电影就开始了
and there is the movie was going to begin right?

1442
01:19:42,588 --> 01:19:45,588
{\a6}巴瑞 莱文森，导演
（恐怖海湾/少年福尔摩斯/雨人）

1443
01:19:42,588 --> 01:19:45,791
然后你惊呼：“天啊，真带劲儿！”
and you went “oh, my gosh! oh, this is special!”

1444
01:19:46,201 --> 01:19:48,848
这是我童年时代的印象
that’s my childhood image

1445
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:50,520
如今这已经不是带劲儿的事了
it’s not special anymore

1446
01:19:50,530 --> 01:19:52,610
已经是别的了
it’s another thing

1447
01:19:52,611 --> 01:19:55,164
一个世纪以来电影院都跟教堂似的
in a way cinema was a church between a century

1448
01:19:55,165 --> 01:19:57,857
因为同样是很多人进到一个又大又黑的房间
because we come to this large dark room and sit

1449
01:19:57,858 --> 01:20:00,179
看着屏幕想这会是个什么故事
looked up and think what it would tell you

1450
01:20:00,180 --> 01:20:03,180
{\a6}卡萨布兰卡，1942

1451
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:04,717
好多关于穿衣、行为、怎么讨好姑娘和怎么扮演英雄
enormous amount how to dress how to act be with woman how to act hero

1452
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:11,250
那个时代的屏幕很不同
something is extraordinary about the scene

1453
01:20:11,251 --> 01:20:13,850
有40尺高
at that age is 40 feet high

1454
01:20:14,221 --> 01:20:15,707
那么大一块屏幕
and in 40 feet high,

1455
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:19,179
相对日常生活很多事都变得神奇起来
something mythic about it is beyond your everyday life

1456
01:20:19,328 --> 01:20:23,647
跨度也很广，应该有80尺
it’s so much big huge span, it should be 80 feet wide

1457
01:20:23,648 --> 01:20:25,597
观众应该被屏幕包围
you should envelop the audience in the screen

1458
01:20:26,125 --> 01:20:28,494
因为那才是电影院- -对，那才是电影院
cause that’s cinema--yeah, that’s cinema

1459
01:20:28,510 --> 01:20:30,510
声音也每时每刻包围着你
and the sound around you every minute

1460
01:20:30,511 --> 01:20:34,086
我真是不明白为什么有人喜欢在电脑上看电影
I mean why people want to watch movies on their computers I should never know

1461
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,644
我经常在地铁上看到有人用iPhone看电影，人后我就想…
I see people watch movies on their iphone in subway all the time…

1462
01:20:41,552 --> 01:20:43,085
“不要啊！！”
and I went “---no!!!”

1463
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,065
有人说这不是好事，不过也不一定非有那么糟
who might say this is bad, it doesn’t have to be bad

1464
01:20:47,066 --> 01:20:50,176
晚上我妻子睡了，我睡不着
late at night, my wife sleeps and I can’t sleep

1465
01:20:50,177 --> 01:20:52,266
我就会拿起我的iPhone
and I put my xx on my iphone

1466
01:20:52,267 --> 01:20:55,641
再带上副不错的耳机，把屏幕几乎贴脸的看电影
put up good headphone and watch films close to my face

1467
01:20:55,642 --> 01:20:57,452
这很有趣
and this sound interesting about that

1468
01:20:57,650 --> 01:21:00,292
一切都很私人
you‘ve got everything very privately 

1469
01:21:00,293 --> 01:21:03,900
所以挺怀念想哭的却不想人看见的时候
I think it was missing I want to cry without people seeing it

1470
01:21:03,901 --> 01:21:06,880
我放《钢铁木兰花》的时候哭了
I want to cry without people seeing it, I’ll put the <i>steel Magnolias<i>

1471
01:21:06,881 --> 01:21:09,720
要是我妻子醒了，我只好暂停，再藏到枕头里
and I cry and if my wife wakes up I just get pause and put it under a pillow

1472
01:21:09,721 --> 01:21:11,113
这很有趣
and get something interesting about that

1473
01:21:11,114 --> 01:21:13,899
因为以前不可能有机会经历
because you didn’t have a chance to experience before

1474
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:16,900
{\a6}莱娜 杜汉，演员/导演
（微型家具）

1475
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:16,681
约会已经不会有人问“去看电影吧”
You can ask on a date no body’s like “let’s get on the movies” any more

1476
01:21:16,682 --> 01:21:19,560
甚至现在已经是这样的
I don’t even felt that’s going on, I felt like

1477
01:21:19,561 --> 01:21:22,840
人们会说“我们在床上看看Netflix有什么吧”
people like “let’s watch something on Netflix streaming on my bed” which

1478
01:21:19,561 --> 01:21:22,840
{\a6}*Netflix：相当于掌上影院*

1479
01:21:22,841 --> 01:21:25,500
然后一群24岁的年轻人就在床上等着
was 24 years old guys waiting to get you sit on their bed

1480
01:21:25,501 --> 01:21:27,550
不过这确实是正在发生的事情
but I think that’s what’s happening

1481
01:21:27,551 --> 01:21:31,452
我能看到正在上映的电影，能从平板电脑或其他的什么上看任何电影
I can get any on movie I can get any movie from pad or anything

1482
01:21:31,453 --> 01:21:34,285
对我来说再自然不过，坐下就看呗
That’s naturalest thing to me I can sit down and watching

1483
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:37,750
不过会丢掉好多细节啊，那就没法感受电影的魅力了
but you will not see all the detail that you won’t be able to feel it

1484
01:21:37,751 --> 01:21:39,329
比如说就没法感受…
like if you be able to feel…

1485
01:21:39,330 --> 01:21:41,371
我的高清电视大着呢
my big HDTV is 20 big

1486
01:21:41,372 --> 01:21:44,285
你是说和女孩子亲热这类的东西吗？
You mean go to see make up with girls like that

1487
01:21:44,286 --> 01:21:46,469
没兴趣，我早过了那个年龄了
But that, no, I’m way past that

1488
01:21:46,470 --> 01:21:47,398
真的吗？
Are you sure?

1489
01:21:47,399 --> 01:21:48,744
相信我啦
Believe me

1490
01:21:48,745 --> 01:21:51,299
看电影的方式越来越多
So many different way for watching movie

1491
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:54,271
分享经历的方式
That sharing experience aspect to it

1492
01:21:54,761 --> 01:21:58,894
正在改变看去影院看电影的习惯
That shifting, going to the movies

1493
01:21:58,952 --> 01:22:02,516
也很大程度上变得虚拟了
Well it’s also becoming much larger virtually

1494
01:22:02,517 --> 01:22:05,813
可视世界已经大大像虚拟化延伸了
Mural space was definitely spanned virtually

1495
01:22:05,814 --> 01:22:10,782
大家在虚拟世界里分享电影
So they’re watching movies together in this sort of virtual worlds

1496
01:22:10,790 --> 01:22:13,267
几乎是不可避免的
And that will be inevitable

1497
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,786
费洛蒙也要虚拟交换么？
You had to get the Pheromone to exchange virtually

1498
01:22:17,787 --> 01:22:24,706
（啥？）怎么流血怎么流汗，不接触怎么爽啊
(Yeah?) how do you bleed and sweat and be comfortable without getting together

1499
01:22:24,707 --> 01:22:26,563
你在影院做那些吗？穿着拉风风衣？
You do that in the theater? In your trench coat

1500
01:22:26,564 --> 01:22:30,278
倒没有，不过可以一起笑一起哭啊
No but laughing together and crying together

1501
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:35,062
有时候虚拟的经验反而更加奏效
Some way the virtual experience is more rewarding because

1502
01:22:35,063 --> 01:22:37,198
因为总有实际的对话框在
There is a actual dialog going on

1503
01:22:38,637 --> 01:22:40,820
这些20多岁的小年轻不在乎
So these 20-year-old does not care

1504
01:22:40,821 --> 01:22:45,185
不过在共享空间倒有很多影院呢
But there are lots of cinemas in the communal space

1505
01:22:45,186 --> 01:22:49,504
他们只谈论在脸书还是什么上又交了什么好友
There they just sit in and tell a story getting friends on Facebook or whatever it is

1506
01:22:49,505 --> 01:22:52,291
你得适应，你要适应不了也没事
You got to go with it, if you can’t be able to deal with it

1507
01:22:52,292 --> 01:22:55,542
因为你的时代已经过去了
that’s fine, because it means your time is finished

1508
01:22:55,543 --> 01:22:58,003
大家看开点吧
it’s time for all the people to take it on

1509
01:22:58,747 --> 01:23:01,022
30以下的小孩们
the kids, 30 and under

1510
01:23:01,023 --> 01:23:07,059
在电脑电视上看了无数的数字影像
have seen endless digital image on their computer, on their television

1511
01:23:07,379 --> 01:23:11,048
对于他们，那就是他们的电影
and that to them is their film

1512
01:23:11,309 --> 01:23:14,978
我曾经希望这些小型摄像机
I just had hoped that these little cameras

1513
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:20,365
可以促成民间电影的一场革命
will make a revolution where you would say the folk films good

1514
01:23:20,366 --> 01:23:22,337
不过自己制作的话
Just do it ourselves

1515
01:23:22,338 --> 01:23:27,213
许多才华和人才都因为免费而得不到足够尊重
so a lot of talent and stuff could be free by less respect

1516
01:23:27,214 --> 01:23:29,117
全民都在解读电影
Everyone is interpreting

1517
01:23:29,387 --> 01:23:34,077
他们通过镜头和画面解读事实或者自以为的事实
Their reality or what they did their reality through an image, through a lens

1518
01:23:34,078 --> 01:23:39,000
不过有些孩子真的还挺擅长这个的
And some kids are really good at it, I’ll tell you

1519
01:23:39,001 --> 01:23:42,001
{\a6}微型家具，2010
设备：佳能 7D

1520
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:46,455
我热爱DV文化，否则我也不会拍这部电影
I love digital video culture, or I won’t never making with this

1521
01:23:46,456 --> 01:23:49,600
因为我是作家出身，而我认为
Because I came out as a writer and I thought that as

1522
01:23:49,601 --> 01:23:51,426
电影制作人应该是有专业知识
you have certain kind of knowledg

1523
01:23:51,427 --> 01:23:53,191
然后可以自由操控
and basically my head keeps a thought like a dude

1524
01:23:53,192 --> 01:23:55,746
拍摄机器的那么一个人
who operational machine to do this job

1525
01:23:55,747 --> 01:23:58,903
我觉得真踏上那条路我会害怕的
I think I would be scared to step into that road

1526
01:23:58,904 --> 01:24:04,476
巨大的摄像机和15人的灯光团队
If it had to involve getting a huge camera and get a 15 lightening technicians together

1527
01:24:04,477 --> 01:24:11,565
我觉得用这样小而且私人的方式体验电影制作就可以了
I was able to experience making movies small private way which I need to do

1528
01:24:11,566 --> 01:24:14,352
佳能5D和尼康单反如何呢
What about the 5Ds, what about the DLSRs

1529
01:24:14,353 --> 01:24:18,021
这些相机是给记者设计的
These cameras are designed to the request of APM writers

1530
01:24:18,030 --> 01:24:25,102
摄影师可以拍摄新闻视频给网站
So there news photographers could shoot news video for their websites

1531
01:24:25,733 --> 01:24:27,173
仅此而已
That’s it

1532
01:24:27,815 --> 01:24:29,766
人们会觉得
then people came along went:

1533
01:24:29,767 --> 01:24:32,784
“哇，还不错，我也要用”
“woo, I like the look of that, I’m gonna use that”

1534
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:34,693
然后效果也不错
And it can work

1535
01:24:34,695 --> 01:24:37,157
不过拍电影可不行 --  为什么？
but I hate it being used as movie cameras -- Why?

1536
01:24:37,158 --> 01:24:39,197
不够好
It’s not good enough

1537
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:42,538
但是它们便宜，人人都能拍电影
But they ain’t expensive, people can make movies

1538
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:46,206
如果我是艺校的学生，有台7D或5D
If I’ve been in art school and I have a Canon 7D or 5D

1539
01:24:46,207 --> 01:24:48,203
那肯定很棒
It would be wonderful

1540
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,136
你今晚用什么拍？
What are you shooting on tonight?

1541
01:24:52,137 --> 01:24:54,783
7D。天，7D耶
-7D. Oh my God, that’s 7D

1542
01:24:54,784 --> 01:24:56,826
是为了研二的作业
For my second year of grad film

1543
01:25:01,674 --> 01:25:08,152
我猜是因为易用，拍的不赖，而且不贵
I guess it’s accessible, give you a lot that you can capture, but it’s not super expensive

1544
01:25:08,153 --> 01:25:11,153
{\a6}舒提 甘古利，纽约大学研究生

1545
01:25:08,153 --> 01:25:13,586
我用7D或5D拍摄主要是预算原因
I want to shoot with the 7D or 5D primarily for budget reasons

1546
01:25:13,746 --> 01:25:19,623
还因为只有一周时间可用了
And because we are given a week in which we have to shoot our film

1547
01:25:19,624 --> 01:25:24,917
大部分时间都花在了选题、约场地
And in amount of time we were lose in terms like changing film checking the gate

1548
01:25:24,918 --> 01:25:30,546
所以时间不够用也是原因
And then I would probably not be able to film the soon I want to

1549
01:25:30,550 --> 01:25:36,781
想要讲自己的故事变得很便宜
It becomes the very cheap way for us to tell our stories about ourselves

1550
01:25:37,912 --> 01:25:41,846
它已经跳出了与环境抗争的艺术载体
It takes this art format out of where fighting environment

1551
01:25:41,847 --> 01:25:44,168
很多人都加入了艺术创作的行列
and a lot more people to make art

1552
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:51,153
人人都有纸和笔
Everybody and his little brother has a piece of paper and pencil

1553
01:25:51,521 --> 01:25:54,600
但伟大的故事又
But how many great stories had been written

1554
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,630
在这纸上写出多少呢
on that piece of paper

1555
01:25:57,310 --> 01:26:01,211
现在同样的事要发生在电影身上了
Now the same thing is gonna happen in cinema

1556
01:26:01,212 --> 01:26:07,563
几个电影人聚在一起
There used to be in conference when film making guys

1557
01:26:08,018 --> 01:26:10,201
坐在咖啡店闲谈
people sat in coffee shop and saying

1558
01:26:10,202 --> 01:26:13,544
说如果有机会，自己会制作多么伟大的电影
What great film they would make if the man would ever give me a chance

1559
01:26:13,545 --> 01:26:18,223
现在好了，人人有机会，放手去做就行
It was kind of great when the day came that it was we go do it

1560
01:26:19,149 --> 01:26:23,329
现在每个人都能做电影，电影遍地开花，这不错
Everybody can make a movie now, movies are everywhere, that’s a good thing

1561
01:26:23,787 --> 01:26:26,945
我不这么认为，其实好处少
I don’t think so actually, there’s less good

1562
01:26:26,946 --> 01:26:28,152
坏处多
There’s more bad

1563
01:26:28,153 --> 01:26:31,125
因为每个人都想做什么做什么
because everybody is able to do whatever they want to do

1564
01:26:31,126 --> 01:26:34,375
真是民主，真是不错
That’s democratization out there, that’s fantastic

1565
01:26:34,376 --> 01:26:36,090
但是我们的下一代会吃苦头的
But I think my kids will suffer

1566
01:26:36,091 --> 01:26:38,662
他们再不会享受到我们成长时期所拥有的品质了
they will not have the qualities we have been growing up

1567
01:26:38,663 --> 01:26:40,756
因为不会再有人…
Cause there isn’t somebody there…

1568
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:43,073
不会再有人在乎品味了
There isn’t a taste make involved

1569
01:26:43,266 --> 01:26:44,189
天
Wow!

1570
01:26:48,236 --> 01:26:51,180
胶片已经完了么？您怎么看
Is this the end of film? What do you think?

1571
01:26:51,181 --> 01:26:56,247
我觉得，赛璐珞仍然是个选择
I think celluloid is still gonna be a choice

1572
01:26:56,248 --> 01:26:57,248
{\a6}大艺术家，2011，胶片摄制

1573
01:26:57,249 --> 01:26:58,249
{\a6}点球成金，2011，胶片摄制

1574
01:26:58,250 --> 01:27:01,249
{\a6}碟中谍：幽灵协议，2011，胶片摄制

1575
01:27:01,250 --> 01:27:04,249
{\a6}生命之树，2011，胶片摄制

1576
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:07,249
{\a6}战马，2011，胶片摄制

1577
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,990
{\a6}饥饿游戏，2012，胶片摄制

1578
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
{\a6}黑暗骑士崛起，2012，胶片摄制

1579
01:27:13,612 --> 01:27:17,420
转变只因为有一个新的选择
a transition starts with people offering a new choice

1580
01:27:17,421 --> 01:27:20,578
不过是否意味着旧的选择即将被取代
But if it finished it will take the old choice away

1581
01:27:20,579 --> 01:27:23,968
我不认为现在的技术已经准备好了
I don’t think techniques are ready to do that yet

1582
01:27:23,969 --> 01:27:28,008
我们有100多年纯粹用胶片拍摄的历史
we have hundred years of experience basically shooting on film

1583
01:27:28,851 --> 01:27:31,126
而现在胶片也还在使用
And film it still around

1584
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:34,432
不管乔治卢卡斯说什么“胶片已死”
No matter what George Lucas said that “film is dead”

1585
01:27:34,433 --> 01:27:36,700
他其实20年前就这么说了
he said that 20 years ago

1586
01:27:36,934 --> 01:27:41,021
但是胶片没有死，人们还是喜欢用胶片
But film is not dead because people like to shooting on film

1587
01:27:41,022 --> 01:27:45,015
因为胶片真的可以呈现难以置信的美
because it really has an incredibly beautiful look

1588
01:27:45,016 --> 01:27:46,393
谁在乎啊
Who cares

1589
01:27:46,394 --> 01:27:49,783
20年内他们就不会再说胶片怎样怎样
In 20 years from now they wouldn’t be saying what looks like film

1590
01:27:49,784 --> 01:27:51,965
转而说“看看我的数位摄像机能做什么吧”
they would be saying “look what I can do with my digital”

1591
01:27:51,966 --> 01:27:54,380
我会是最后还在使用胶片摄像的人
I will be the one last guy shooting film

1592
01:27:54,381 --> 01:27:57,167
因为没人剩下了
Cause no one else would be left shooting film

1593
01:27:57,168 --> 01:28:01,950
而且我确定在10年间我也会开始使用数字技术
But I certain will be use digital technology within the next 10 years

1594
01:28:01,951 --> 01:28:05,005
我希望，要是5到10年内胶片还存在的话
I hope, if in another 5 or 10 years film still exists

1595
01:28:05,006 --> 01:28:07,327
我还是打算继续用胶片拍
I still plan to shoot on film

1596
01:28:07,328 --> 01:28:09,637
胶片是不是完了？
Is it the end of film? 

1597
01:28:11,228 --> 01:28:13,271
对，我猜它是完了
Yeah, I guess it is

1598
01:28:13,272 --> 01:28:16,522
而且我认为5年之内，胶片就会
And I think in 5 years, film will be

1599
01:28:16,908 --> 01:28:20,066
胶片就几乎不会存在了
film will be exception, I really do

1600
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:25,493
胶片设备销售在2007年达到了顶峰
Film production peaked in 2007

1601
01:28:25,494 --> 01:28:28,494
{\a6}比尔 罗素，阿莱摄像部副总裁

1602
01:28:25,494 --> 01:28:31,158
我们在那时已经是10%过盛生产胶片摄像机了
Our factory at that time was working 110% to produce film cameras

1603
01:28:31,159 --> 01:28:32,134
然后呢
Then what happened?

1604
01:28:32,743 --> 01:28:34,508
然后世界变了
Then the world changed

1605
01:28:35,592 --> 01:28:38,286
所有的订单都变成数字的了
New purchases are all digital

1606
01:28:39,568 --> 01:28:42,261
胶片摄影机可以延续数十年
Film cameras can last for decades

1607
01:28:42,262 --> 01:28:45,233
仍能使用也仍被使用
They will be still available and in use

1608
01:28:45,234 --> 01:28:48,662
然而，主流厂商
However, our major manufactures

1609
01:28:48,663 --> 01:28:51,356
已经停止新胶片摄像机的发展
have seized the development of new film cameras

1610
01:28:50,386 --> 01:28:53,386
{\a6} “结束了，阿莱、潘纳维申的胶片摄像机”

1611
01:28:53,387 --> 01:28:56,387
{\a6}“电影摄像机公司已静静停止生产胶片摄像机”

1612
01:28:51,848 --> 01:28:53,984
他们不再生产胶片摄影机了
They no longer make them

1613
01:28:55,098 --> 01:28:57,095
我们不得不和赛璐珞说再见了
We will have to say goodbye to celluloid

1614
01:28:57,096 --> 01:28:59,170
胶片会消失
it will go away I’m afraid

1615
01:28:58,288 --> 01:29:01,288
{\a6}“胶片像影机，1888-2011”

1616
01:28:59,171 --> 01:29:00,897
因为某些特殊用途它们还是会存在
And they will be cared for special occasions

1617
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:03,495
但是其它的都要变了
I think, but it’s gonna change

1618
01:29:03,496 --> 01:29:06,051
一旦这个选择消失了
once that option is gone

1619
01:29:06,052 --> 01:29:07,119
嗯
Right

1620
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:10,183
一旦现在的年轻人不再有胶片电影的体验
Once young people don’t have the experience

1621
01:29:10,184 --> 01:29:14,316
我觉得我们正在经历这场全面变革
I think we are living through this total transformation

1622
01:29:14,317 --> 01:29:18,078
我觉得大概人们都会担心这会是没完没了的吵杂
I think in general people will fear it’s just endless noise

1623
01:29:18,079 --> 01:29:20,678
没人说的清什么是好的，什么是坏的
no one was able to tell what’s good or bad

1624
01:29:20,679 --> 01:29:23,279
没人能真正做出好东西
No one will be able to make good things

1625
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:25,090
所有好的都会消失
And good things will just get lost

1626
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:28,527
我觉得我们的文化继承岌岌可危
That in danger I think, the continuation of our culture

1627
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:30,988
一切归于尘土
What will back to me need to back to the wild

1628
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:31,563
嗯
Right

1629
01:29:31,564 --> 01:29:36,067
你从哪里获得文化、艺术和知识的给养呢
Where did you get the nourishment of culturally, artistically, intellectually

1630
01:29:36,068 --> 01:29:37,128
哪里呢
Where did you get it

1631
01:29:37,711 --> 01:29:42,123
电影制作的关键一步是存档
And an important step of movie making process is archival

1632
01:29:42,548 --> 01:29:47,471
把成片和其他材料储存起来
Storing the final complete movie and materials used to create it

1633
01:29:48,114 --> 01:29:51,039
没人把存档当回事
Nobody takes archival seriously

1634
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:53,222
人们都把东西存在硬盘里
They’re all save it on hard drive

1635
01:29:53,223 --> 01:29:56,008
放了一年再拿出来
And if the hard drive on the shelf and a year later

1636
01:29:56,009 --> 01:29:58,645
放的时候可能就出现“哒哒哒”的声音
You load it, it just got “ter…ter…”

1637
01:29:58,648 --> 01:30:00,413
因为卡住了
Because they stick

1638
01:30:01,232 --> 01:30:03,647
它不会总是这样
You don’t find them all time they stick

1639
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:05,644
不过要是你发现了
If You do find out all the time

1640
01:30:05,645 --> 01:30:09,359
那就是坏了，然后哒哒响
they wear out and go “ter…ter…”

1641
01:30:09,647 --> 01:30:13,966
1950年代起，在电视广告开始兴盛的时期
Since the early 1950s, since the advance of the commercial television

1642
01:30:14,616 --> 01:30:17,616
{\a6}迈克尔 五井，摄影，美国摄影师协会主席

1643
01:30:13,967 --> 01:30:17,402
有80多种视频格式
There had been 80 formats of video

1644
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:20,000
现在这80多种视频格式
Today, these 80 formats of video

1645
01:30:21,950 --> 01:30:24,620
的大多数已经完全不能播放了
most cannot be played anymore

1646
01:30:24,621 --> 01:30:27,105
就因为播放器已经不存在了
Cause the machine simply don’t exist

1647
01:30:27,421 --> 01:30:32,205
拍电影的时候我们会把样片做2个数字备份
When we make a movie we have 2 digital copies of all of the dailys

1648
01:30:32,206 --> 01:30:34,680
你把这些拷贝装箱的时候
When you box those how to be stored

1649
01:30:34,681 --> 01:30:38,534
最好放个播放器在旁边
Yet put a reader in with that thing

1650
01:30:38,751 --> 01:30:45,996
我有8种80年代做的音乐短片和广告存档格式
I have archival 8 formats for music video and commercials I did n 1980s

1651
01:30:46,786 --> 01:30:50,404
已经没机器能播了
And there’s no machine that can play them

1652
01:30:50,405 --> 01:30:53,650
在数字世界你完全找不到
There are no archives or formats or anything

1653
01:30:53,651 --> 01:30:56,455
任何实体存档格式
in the digital world that you will put any stock in

1654
01:30:56,456 --> 01:30:59,334
所以数字格式的存档问题含待解决
so their archive issues are simply not being dealt with yet

1655
01:30:59,335 --> 01:31:01,702
对于电影
The only thing you can sure of the on film

1656
01:31:01,703 --> 01:31:03,931
或其他的动态影像来说
or anything of the moving image

1657
01:31:03,932 --> 01:31:06,393
你能保证存储个六七十年的
is gonna be around may by for 60 or 70 years from now

1658
01:31:06,394 --> 01:31:08,390
很有趣也很讽刺
Interestingly enough, ironically enough

1659
01:31:08,391 --> 01:31:09,551
只有赛璐珞
The celluloid

1660
01:31:15,498 --> 01:31:18,498
{\a6}盖瑞 因豪斯，柯达首席技术官

1661
01:31:15,498 --> 01:31:16,288
胶片是特别的
Film is unique

1662
01:31:16,289 --> 01:31:19,028
因为胶片同时是捕获和存储介质
Because film is a capture medium and an storage medium

1663
01:31:20,347 --> 01:31:22,322
所以你要回看的话
So if you really want to go back

1664
01:31:22,323 --> 01:31:24,510
只要保存得当
and if you can restore it in the right conditions

1665
01:31:25,271 --> 01:31:27,686
100年后只要有光
A hundred years later all you have to do is shining light through it

1666
01:31:27,687 --> 01:31:28,800
也还是可以看
And you are able to see it

1667
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:31,540
不会有格式淘汰的问题
There were never be format obsolete

1668
01:31:31,564 --> 01:31:34,564
{\a6}爱德 斯塔拉德曼，动态影像助理馆长
乔治 伊斯特曼博物馆（世界最古老的摄影博物馆和影片藏馆）

1669
01:31:31,564 --> 01:31:33,653
1909年
There was a conference in 1909

1670
01:31:33,654 --> 01:31:37,322
胶片的规格和标准被整理确定
Where they put together the standard for film

1671
01:31:38,268 --> 01:31:40,683
102年未变
While it hasn’t changed for 102 years

1672
01:31:41,752 --> 01:31:43,841
我用氮气保存的胶片
I have a film in my nitrogen forms 

1673
01:31:43,842 --> 01:31:46,628
现在仍能在放映机上放映
I can pull it out and run it on the projector today

1674
01:31:46,629 --> 01:31:49,315
尽管我知道这是1895年拍摄完成的
even know it was made in 1895

1675
01:31:50,549 --> 01:31:53,661
如果换个观点，想想存档
If the point, alternately the archiving is

1676
01:31:53,662 --> 01:31:57,469
可以是原始作品的完全复制
the faithful reproduction of the original product

1677
01:31:59,009 --> 01:32:02,771
那电影人现在有更好的机会
Film makers now have a better chance

1678
01:32:02,772 --> 01:32:06,500
让自己的作品可以
of something I may being showed properly 50 years from now

1679
01:32:06,501 --> 01:32:09,091
在50年后仍完美展现
that I ever have in history

1680
01:32:09,092 --> 01:32:12,853
可人们总说“我们可不知道50年后会发生什么
people keep saying “we don’t know what’s going to happen in 50 years,

1681
01:32:12,854 --> 01:32:15,128
“也许就没法播放了
“we don’t know how to read the information or

1682
01:32:15,129 --> 01:32:19,096
“也许就烂掉了，你必须转换它要不就没有了”
“it’s going to decay, you have to migrated or it will die”

1683
01:32:19,097 --> 01:32:21,789
对，没错，得转换，不过还有一件事
yeah, sure, you will, and some of the those things are true

1684
01:32:21,790 --> 01:32:24,251
这样的解决方案总比胶片好
all of them are better scenario than film

1685
01:32:28,276 --> 01:32:30,737
几乎这世界上的所有东西
all of everything in this whole world

1686
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:32,455
都在用数字存储
is stored digitally

1687
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:34,081
是啊
yeah

1688
01:32:34,082 --> 01:32:37,424
对啊，问题就在这里
Yeah, there are problems with it

1689
01:32:38,075 --> 01:32:39,839
但是问题是可以被解决的
But they are gonna solve those problems

1690
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:40,954
这点我保证
I’ll guarantee that

1691
01:32:41,648 --> 01:32:43,459
这么多的数字信息
There’s too much digital information out there

1692
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:46,484
不可能没有更全面的存储解决办法
not to figure out a full proof way to storage forever

1693
01:32:46,749 --> 01:32:50,557
历史总是在进步
Archeology always improves

1694
01:32:50,558 --> 01:32:54,040
某些我们无法控制的变化
So as the way we lose things change

1695
01:32:54,041 --> 01:32:57,306
也许正是我们找到解决方案的契机
The way that we invent to find them changes

1696
01:32:57,307 --> 01:32:59,303
所以您并不担心这些消失的东西咯
So you are not worried about all these disappearing

1697
01:33:00,308 --> 01:33:02,445
如果某件事对人类真的是重要的
Is things are important for human beings

1698
01:33:02,446 --> 01:33:04,070
那就肯定会有保存的办法
we figure out a way to preserve them

1699
01:33:04,071 --> 01:33:05,556
这总是没错的
It’s always been truth

1700
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,065
这是我们生活的一部分
Yes we do that part of life

1701
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:14,304
有一天我们也许会在舞台上展示胶片印片
We might get to the stage where a print of a film

1702
01:33:14,306 --> 01:33:18,902
因为稀有而使它更像一件艺术品
Is so rare is almost like an art object

1703
01:33:19,148 --> 01:33:20,959
而我们可以说：
And we can go back and say

1704
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:25,232
“这是一份胶片的印片，全世界唯一一份”
“this is actually a print of film and it’s the only one of the world.”

1705
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:31,761
一两百年后这些都不会剩下任何踪迹
100, 200 years from now there won’t be a trace of this left

1706
01:33:32,333 --> 01:33:36,048
我们现在所制造的东西也都没有任何踪迹
And there won’t be trace of anything we make now

1707
01:33:39,375 --> 01:33:41,279
所以你身在何方？能把你怎样
So where are we? what fucked you?

1708
01:33:47,486 --> 01:33:49,994
我从不相信
I don’t believe in one second that

1709
01:33:49,995 --> 01:33:52,919
数字影片或数字技术
digital imaging or digital technology

1710
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:56,580
会改变人类讲故事的方式
will ever take the way the humanity of story-telling

1711
01:33:56,810 --> 01:33:59,810
{\a6} 2001太空漫游，1968

1712
01:33:56,581 --> 01:33:58,585
因为这关于我们的本质
beause story-telling in it on ourselves

1713
01:33:58,586 --> 01:34:01,650
这是神圣的人类事物
it’s a holy human concern

1714
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:06,400
艺术家比较淳朴，科学家也比较淳朴
artist primordial, science also quite primordial

1715
01:34:06,401 --> 01:34:10,450
这其实很和谐
so kind of all these things are very harmony things

1716
01:34:10,451 --> 01:34:12,586
他们总是在互相推进
They always had to push on one another

1717
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:15,942
我们已经达到化学摄像技术的顶端
We are at the top of photo chemical process

1718
01:34:15,943 --> 01:34:17,660
也就能走这么远了
This is about far as we’re ever gonna go

1719
01:34:17,661 --> 01:34:20,400
但是用数字技术的话，我们就重新回归到初始了
When you are using digital, you are at the very bottom again

1720
01:34:20,890 --> 01:34:24,512
所以要跳出传统帮助创新
So you should jump over and help to build that

1721
01:34:24,860 --> 01:34:27,182
因为越多人使用才能使这项技术越好
Cause more people use it, the better it gets

1722
01:34:28,643 --> 01:34:31,522
除非你参与到这场变革中
Unless you are participate into the revolution

1723
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,904
否则就会被落下
Or you will be lost in past

1724
01:34:34,599 --> 01:34:37,478
我们不能说“没我的事
We can’t call ourselves as “we don’t care

1725
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,486
看你们了”
They are up to your guys now”

1726
01:34:40,704 --> 01:34:42,887
我们要参与其中
So we have to be in it

1727
01:34:42,888 --> 01:34:47,985
每个人都能参与到这个过程中
Everyone will have access to both the means of the production

1728
01:34:47,986 --> 01:34:51,468
也能立刻了解到曾经发生的事
and watch everything ever exist instantly

1729
01:34:51,469 --> 01:34:55,742
随着数字技术持续改变我们讲故事的本质
As digital continues to change the nature of story-telling

1730
01:34:55,743 --> 01:34:57,274
我们也在改变
We also continue to change

1731
01:34:57,275 --> 01:34:59,875
甚至这种改变我自己都不能理解
In ways that I could not even understand

1732
01:35:00,154 --> 01:35:04,565
不过所有的都在改变，这就成了一场巨大的变革
But all things do that and it becomes a giant revolution

1733
01:35:05,502 --> 01:35:10,425
人们喜欢好故事，好故事能带他们去从未体验过的世界
People love great stories, they let them getting into the world they haven’t experienced

1734
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:16,044
至于是怎么去的，我觉得并不重要
And how they get there, it doesn’t really matter

1735
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:20,083
我们开始使用数字技术到如今的程度，并不意味着停滞不前了
One shouldn’t even think we stop when now we reach digital this is it

1736
01:35:21,122 --> 01:35:24,883
完全不是，想想看娱乐形式如何表现
No, no, think about where the entertainment imports

1737
01:35:24,884 --> 01:35:27,809
大众需求又何去何从
Where the need is going to go

1738
01:35:27,810 --> 01:35:31,896
您能感觉到技术上您所在的位置吗？
Do you feel technologically with where you are

1739
01:35:31,897 --> 01:35:33,103
您是否觉得自由？
Dou you feel free

1740
01:35:33,104 --> 01:35:35,843
我不认为我想要去感觉
I’m not sure that I ever want to feel

1741
01:35:35,844 --> 01:35:39,373
我们已经到达了某处，从技术上讲
that we arrived, technologically

1742
01:35:39,374 --> 01:35:41,978
我觉得我们总能做得更好
I always feel that there is something we can do better

1743
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:46,483
我们的前辈给了世界去梦想的新时代
The people who coming to us gave the world new ace to dream

1744
01:35:46,780 --> 01:35:49,380
我认为我们要继续他们的事业
I think it’s our job to continue that

1745
01:35:49,381 --> 01:35:52,306
继续给人们创造梦想
and to try to give people new ace to dream

1746
01:35:52,637 --> 01:35:56,027
所有最后都会回归到一件事
Everything comes down to one thing

1747
01:35:56,028 --> 01:35:58,860
如果你用心去做
If you do something with your heart

1748
01:35:58,860 --> 01:36:02,907
如果你能够让我们感受到它
if you do something convince us to feel about it

1749
01:36:03,424 --> 01:36:06,443
那你用什么做到的并不重要
It doesn’t matter what you using
