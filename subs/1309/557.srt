1
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:17,934
It's a wonder...

2
00:02:18,103 --> 00:02:21,104
...Wonder Woman...

3
00:02:21,273 --> 00:02:25,982
You're so wild and wonderful

4
00:02:27,654 --> 00:02:30,572
'Cause it seems whenever...

5
00:02:32,076 --> 00:02:34,198
...we're together...

6
00:02:34,369 --> 00:02:38,367
...the planets all stand still.

7
00:03:01,855 --> 00:03:04,940
Barbarella's psychedelia...

8
00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:09,652
...there's a kind of cockle shell
about you.

9
00:03:10,531 --> 00:03:14,279
Barbarella... Bar... Barbarella.

10
00:03:14,451 --> 00:03:17,452
You dazzle me with rainbow
colors...

11
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:21,998
Fade away the duller shade
of living...

12
00:03:22,918 --> 00:03:25,207
Get me up high...

13
00:03:26,004 --> 00:03:28,080
Teach me to fly...

14
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:30,508
Electrify...

15
00:03:33,178 --> 00:03:35,254
A night with starry light...

16
00:03:35,431 --> 00:03:38,431
...above the stratosphere.

17
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,720
Bring your dearness near

18
00:03:41,895 --> 00:03:44,647
Till the dawn comes tumbling down

19
00:03:44,815 --> 00:03:46,558
Don't make a sound.

20
00:03:46,734 --> 00:03:51,230
Every word we need
comes from the sky.

21
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:54,572
Can't you read my mind

22
00:03:54,742 --> 00:03:56,781
Say in love

23
00:03:58,746 --> 00:04:03,740
Don't you give me a cold shoulder

24
00:04:03,917 --> 00:04:06,954
Still I'm dying, girl, to hold you

25
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:09,086
And make love...

26
00:04:12,468 --> 00:04:13,843
...Iove...

27
00:04:17,723 --> 00:04:20,724
Barbarella's psychedelia...

28
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:25,305
...never can a fella name or clone you...

29
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,682
Barbarella Bar... Barbarella

30
00:04:50,297 --> 00:04:53,666
Stand by for a message from Dianthus...

31
00:04:53,842 --> 00:04:59,263
...President of Earth and Rotating Premier of the Sun System.

32
00:05:10,651 --> 00:05:13,106
- Barbarella?
- Mr. President.

33
00:05:17,241 --> 00:05:19,198
- Love!
- Love!

34
00:05:20,619 --> 00:05:22,161
Just a minute. I'll slip something on.

35
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:25,615
Don't trouble yourself. This is an affair of state.

36
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:29,919
What I must say not only is grave... It's a secret.

37
00:05:30,087 --> 00:05:31,462
A secret?

38
00:05:32,423 --> 00:05:37,168
Have you ever heard of a young scientist named Duran Duran?

39
00:05:37,344 --> 00:05:40,713
- Yes.
- Recently en route to the North Star...

40
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:44,175
...he vanished into the uncharted regions of Tau Ceti.

41
00:05:44,351 --> 00:05:46,178
But... why is that a secret?

42
00:05:46,353 --> 00:05:50,849
Because Duran Duran is the inventor of the Positronic Ray.

43
00:05:51,024 --> 00:05:54,643
- It's a weapon.
- Weapon?

44
00:05:56,071 --> 00:05:58,194
Why would anyone want to invent a weapon?

45
00:05:58,365 --> 00:06:00,025
How should I know?

46
00:06:01,952 --> 00:06:04,621
The universe has been pacified for centuries, sir.

47
00:06:04,788 --> 00:06:10,791
As far as we know. Yet we know nothing of Tau Ceti or its inhabitants.

48
00:06:10,961 --> 00:06:13,748
Could they still be in a primitive state of neurotic irresponsibility?

49
00:06:13,922 --> 00:06:19,083
Precisely. And If they learn from this young scientist...

50
00:06:19,261 --> 00:06:21,834
...the secret of the Positronic Ray...

51
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:27,257
...they will be able to shatter the loving union of the universe.

52
00:06:27,853 --> 00:06:33,060
- That might mean archaic insecurity...
- And war.

53
00:06:33,984 --> 00:06:38,397
- You mean selfish competition and...
- I mean war.

54
00:06:38,572 --> 00:06:42,617
- Bloody conflict among entire tribes.
- I don't believe it.

55
00:06:42,785 --> 00:06:46,236
Neither do I. But we can't take a chance.

56
00:06:47,414 --> 00:06:52,123
- Something must be done.
- Yes. You're the girl who must do it.

57
00:06:52,294 --> 00:06:56,873
- Why me?
- I have no armies or police.

58
00:06:57,049 --> 00:07:04,925
I can't spare the presidential band. Plus, you're a 5-star Astro-Navigatrix.

59
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:09,595
Your mission then: Find Duran Duran...

60
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:14,479
...and use your incomparable talents to preserve the security of the stars...

61
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,734
...and our own mother planet. How do you read me?

62
00:07:17,903 --> 00:07:23,573
- Straight.
- Here's the one known photo of Duran.

63
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:28,739
Age 26. Hazel eyes. A rather handsome fellow.

64
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:34,333
I don't think I'll be able to recognize him, sir.

65
00:07:34,503 --> 00:07:38,714
Now, this is a portable brainwave detector.

66
00:07:41,885 --> 00:07:47,472
Attention... Set your atom transmitter at 0-3-5.

67
00:07:48,726 --> 00:07:52,095
- Positive.
- Object in transit.

68
00:07:53,564 --> 00:07:55,521
Object received.

69
00:07:55,691 --> 00:08:01,397
In order to test for Duran Duran's presence, simply press this contact.

70
00:08:01,572 --> 00:08:07,325
- Light will glow. The alarm will sound.
- It has a built-in tongue box.

71
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:12,112
Here is something you may need.

72
00:08:15,961 --> 00:08:18,879
- It's a weapon?
- For self-preservation.

73
00:08:19,048 --> 00:08:22,167
We borrowed it from the Museum of Conflict.

74
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:27,217
That's my good girl. One day, Barbarella...

75
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:30,224
...we must meet in the flesh.

76
00:08:31,977 --> 00:08:36,604
Thank you. And... love!

77
00:08:37,357 --> 00:08:38,816
Love!

78
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:45,815
Armed... Like a naked savage.

79
00:09:07,721 --> 00:09:10,806
Alpha 7 to Base... Alpha 7 to Base.

80
00:09:11,392 --> 00:09:16,813
We leave the Zone of Solar Attraction in 7 minutes. Acknowledge.

81
00:09:17,648 --> 00:09:19,973
Base to Alpha 7. Acknowledge.

82
00:09:22,236 --> 00:09:25,237
Prepare for acceleration into temporal space.

83
00:09:25,406 --> 00:09:29,534
Acceleration into temporal space... Continuum now beginning.

84
00:09:40,462 --> 00:09:43,712
Alphy, when do we get to the Tau Ceti gravitational field?

85
00:09:43,882 --> 00:09:49,125
154 hours, seven minutes, elapses Earth Time.

86
00:09:49,304 --> 00:09:50,680
Right.

87
00:09:56,061 --> 00:10:00,770
- Wake me up in 154 hours.
- Confirmed.

88
00:10:02,484 --> 00:10:06,102
- Good night, Alphy.
- Confirmed.

89
00:10:44,943 --> 00:10:48,395
De-acceleration looks in line...

90
00:10:49,031 --> 00:10:53,693
Barbarella rise and shine.

91
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:04,077
Prepare to insert nourishment.

92
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:20,393
End of course in temporal acceleration in 7 seconds.

93
00:11:21,271 --> 00:11:23,976
Alphy... It's Tau Ceti.

94
00:11:29,613 --> 00:11:33,397
- What's happening?
- Magnetic disturbances.

95
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:39,202
Magnetic disturbances?

96
00:11:44,628 --> 00:11:46,621
Emergency systems!

97
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:55,008
All emergency systems will now operate.

98
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:07,066
- Our magnetic screens are dead!
- Force of magnetic hurricane is 1 1.9.

99
00:12:07,234 --> 00:12:13,522
Gyro compass is not, repeat, not functioning.

100
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:17,198
- You mean you can't navigate?
- That is correct.

101
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:21,283
I'll switch it to manual. What are our chances?

102
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,252
Our present possibilities of non-destruction...

103
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:30,840
...are 0.00002 to 10,000.

104
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:44,520
My number 2 stabilizer has been damaged.

105
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:52,127
- Where am I?
- That's what I was going to ask you.

106
00:13:53,549 --> 00:13:59,919
Planet 16 in the system Tau Ceti. Air density 0.051.

107
00:14:00,097 --> 00:14:03,680
Cool weather with the possibility of stormy precipitations.

108
00:14:03,851 --> 00:14:08,892
Analysis of the atmosphere: terrestial with a mild excess of oxygen.

109
00:14:09,064 --> 00:14:14,438
I count 600324 molecules per cubic millimeter.

110
00:14:14,611 --> 00:14:16,937
Well, at least I'll be able to breathe.

111
00:15:04,244 --> 00:15:07,494
What marvelous little girls! Hi!

112
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:11,831
Do you speak English?

113
00:15:15,464 --> 00:15:17,872
Parlez-vous francais?

114
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:22,213
Wait, let me adjust my tongue box. Must be a Galactic 5 dialect.

115
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,974
But I haven't skied in ages!

116
00:16:50,893 --> 00:16:54,392
But that's Duran Duran's spaceship!

117
00:17:07,201 --> 00:17:08,743
Hi!

118
00:17:30,474 --> 00:17:35,100
Listen, children, this game is amusing, but it's gone too far.

119
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:40,478
I don't want to hurt you. I want to know some things about this spaceship.

120
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:44,277
Come on, untie me or I'll call your parents.

121
00:17:49,952 --> 00:17:51,825
That's very sweet, but I...

122
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:15,934
No!

123
00:18:44,173 --> 00:18:45,548
Help!

124
00:18:46,467 --> 00:18:47,842
Help!

125
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,016
Stop!

126
00:20:18,767 --> 00:20:20,143
Hello!

127
00:20:25,232 --> 00:20:26,607
Thank you!

128
00:20:29,403 --> 00:20:30,778
No!

129
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:37,694
I can't understand.

130
00:20:38,996 --> 00:20:41,487
Parlez-vous francais?

131
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,116
Better adjust my tongue box.

132
00:20:50,758 --> 00:20:52,133
Are you all right?

133
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:57,004
I think so... Who are you?

134
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:01,555
I am Mark Hand, the catchman. And who are you?

135
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:06,852
I'm from the Planet Earth. Tell me what you know of this spaceship.

136
00:21:07,024 --> 00:21:13,228
I know nothing. It was here when I accepted the job of the catchman.

137
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:18,945
- Catchman?
- Yes. Children live on icey Weir...

138
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:22,453
...until they have reached a serviceable age.

139
00:21:22,623 --> 00:21:26,834
- Serviceable?
- Then I capture them just as you saw.

140
00:21:27,002 --> 00:21:31,000
- I turn them over to the authorities.
- I see.

141
00:21:34,218 --> 00:21:38,547
Thank you. Ever heard the name Duran Duran?

142
00:21:38,722 --> 00:21:45,176
I know nothing. I live alone on icey Weir. Such is a catchman's life.

143
00:21:47,564 --> 00:21:51,265
Only in Sogo will you find the answer to your question.

144
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:55,227
- Sogo? Is it near?
- It's just beyond that ice-deck.

145
00:22:02,913 --> 00:22:06,578
Did I see your spacecraft at the far edge of this lake?

146
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,621
Yes, but I'm afraid it's broken down.

147
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:13,330
- Magnetic storms ruined my stabilizer.
- Perhaps, I can help.

148
00:22:13,507 --> 00:22:21,253
I'm quite experienced mechanically. I service and maintain this icecraft.

149
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:27,346
- If you wish, I'll take you to your ship.
- But there's no wind.

150
00:22:28,397 --> 00:22:29,891
Hold on.

151
00:22:40,117 --> 00:22:42,323
- What a lovely cabin!
- Wind.

152
00:23:01,638 --> 00:23:05,422
I'm so grateful for your help. How can I ever thank you?

153
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:09,385
I'm sure my government would repay you.

154
00:23:09,563 --> 00:23:14,272
If there's anything I can do, please tell me.

155
00:23:14,443 --> 00:23:17,894
You could let me make love to you.

156
00:23:18,072 --> 00:23:20,741
- Make love?
- Yes.

157
00:23:20,908 --> 00:23:24,407
You don't even know my psycho-cardiogram.

158
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,037
On earth people don't make love...

159
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:33,284
...unless their psycho-cardiograms are in perfect confluence.

160
00:23:33,462 --> 00:23:37,590
You asked me what you could do for me. And I told you.

161
00:23:37,758 --> 00:23:41,376
All right. But I don't see what good it will do.

162
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:43,345
- Do you have any pills?
- Pills?

163
00:23:44,181 --> 00:23:49,176
- Never mind, I have some here.
- What is this pill?

164
00:23:50,854 --> 00:23:53,974
An exaltation transference pill, of course.

165
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:56,854
- I know nothing of this.
- I see.

166
00:23:57,027 --> 00:24:01,938
On earth when our psycho-cardiograms are in harmony for lovemaking...

167
00:24:02,116 --> 00:24:04,239
...we take an exaltation transference pill.

168
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:07,280
And remain like this. Here let me show you.

169
00:24:08,288 --> 00:24:11,455
For one minute or until full rapport is achieved.

170
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:25,839
I don't care for that. This is what I mean... the bed!

171
00:24:28,475 --> 00:24:32,722
That? But nobody's done that for centuries!

172
00:24:32,896 --> 00:24:36,431
Except the poor who can't afford the pill or psycho-cardiograms.

173
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:42,029
- Why not?
- It impedes maximum efficiency.

174
00:24:42,197 --> 00:24:47,903
Also substitutes for ego support and self-esteem are now available.

175
00:24:48,078 --> 00:24:53,867
- So, you won't do it?
- If you insist, I guess so.

176
00:24:54,543 --> 00:24:58,244
But there's really no point at all in doing it like this.

177
00:25:04,053 --> 00:25:07,801
- Without your garments, please.
- Oh.

178
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:06,862
Now I'll have a look at your stabilizers.

179
00:26:12,329 --> 00:26:17,952
Since your garment is torn, help yourself to my furs, Barbarella.

180
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:30,282
I think I've found the trouble. You may proceed now to Sogo.

181
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:35,989
It's there you will find Duran Duran Jr. If he still lives...

182
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,414
Good.

183
00:27:40,084 --> 00:27:43,453
Now, Barbarella, don't you agree with me...

184
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:47,876
...that in some things, the old-fashioned ways are best?

185
00:27:48,801 --> 00:27:53,048
What...? Oh, that.

186
00:27:53,222 --> 00:27:56,970
Yes, I must admit it was rather interesting.

187
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:59,764
Still, it is distracting.

188
00:27:59,937 --> 00:28:05,097
- Are you coming with me to Sogo?
- No, I prefer the tranquility of Weir.

189
00:28:05,275 --> 00:28:08,229
Sogo is too strict, the people too dedicated.

190
00:28:08,404 --> 00:28:13,362
Perhaps you'll stop here again... at the end of your mission.

191
00:28:13,534 --> 00:28:16,404
Yes, perhaps I will...

192
00:28:18,205 --> 00:28:21,206
Well, goodbye. And thanks again...

193
00:28:23,127 --> 00:28:24,918
For everything.

194
00:28:25,087 --> 00:28:27,542
It was my pleasure.

195
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:37,803
- Please advise present situation.
- You wouldn't understand.

196
00:28:55,743 --> 00:28:59,740
- Stabilizer's malfunctioning.
- I've been repaired in reverse.

197
00:29:00,956 --> 00:29:03,910
We're going in. I'll activate the Terra screw.

198
00:29:26,774 --> 00:29:28,897
Barbarella!

199
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:32,773
Barbarella!

200
00:29:34,073 --> 00:29:37,073
Full operational power on all subterranean systems.

201
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,457
45 degree ascent.

202
00:29:49,463 --> 00:29:51,290
Quarter-to-half for surfacing.

203
00:30:23,539 --> 00:30:26,326
Got to get rid of this tail.

204
00:31:39,865 --> 00:31:42,356
- I'm dead.
- No.

205
00:31:47,873 --> 00:31:52,085
- Where am I?
- In the labyrinth of the City of Night.

206
00:31:52,252 --> 00:31:56,795
- Are you an angel?
- I'm Pygar, the last ornithanthrope.

207
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:02,882
- How do you do?
- And you?

208
00:32:04,098 --> 00:32:07,716
I'm from Planet Earth. My name is Barbarella.

209
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:14,264
But you're soft and warm. We're told that earth beings are cold.

210
00:32:14,441 --> 00:32:15,935
Not all of us...

211
00:32:17,236 --> 00:32:20,569
My poor spaceship. Look at it.

212
00:32:22,783 --> 00:32:24,158
I'm so sorry.

213
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:28,496
Pygar, what happened to your eyes?

214
00:32:28,664 --> 00:32:32,080
I fell during a magnetic storm and was carried off to Sogo.

215
00:32:32,251 --> 00:32:33,661
Sogo?

216
00:32:33,836 --> 00:32:38,047
The City of Night ruled by the Great Tyrant. There they blinded me.

217
00:32:38,215 --> 00:32:41,999
I was left to die in the labyrinth until Professor Ping found me.

218
00:32:42,177 --> 00:32:43,969
That's terrible.

219
00:32:48,058 --> 00:32:51,059
Can you really fly?

220
00:32:51,228 --> 00:32:53,600
No, I've lost the will to fly.

221
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:58,351
- How awful!
- It no longer matters. It's the past.

222
00:32:58,527 --> 00:33:04,363
- Have you heard of Duran Duran?
- Duran Duran?

223
00:33:04,533 --> 00:33:08,578
Yes, Duran Duran. He's an astronaut from Earth.

224
00:33:08,746 --> 00:33:11,450
I do not know of such things.

225
00:33:13,709 --> 00:33:17,374
- Perhaps Professor Ping can help.
- Professor Ping?

226
00:33:17,546 --> 00:33:20,666
He's very wise and knows all about Sogo.

227
00:33:20,841 --> 00:33:25,218
- Where can I find him?
- He's with the others, eating.

228
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:39,534
- He's there. Professor Ping?
- Professor Ping?

229
00:34:39,712 --> 00:34:42,547
- Yes?
- My name is Barbarella.

230
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:47,964
Tell me. What is your origin?

231
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:57,637
You have the aspect of an earthling. You are of female gender, right?

232
00:34:57,813 --> 00:34:59,852
That is correct.

233
00:35:02,276 --> 00:35:04,849
- Is that an orchid?
- Yes.

234
00:35:05,028 --> 00:35:10,236
Orchids have very little food value and are hard to grow in this climate.

235
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:16,328
It amuses the Great Tyrant to resent the expense of feeding orchids to slaves.

236
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:24,380
- What kind of place is this?
- That is Sogo, the City of Night...

237
00:35:24,548 --> 00:35:29,091
...ruled by the Great Tyrant and dedicated to evil in every form.

238
00:35:29,261 --> 00:35:32,262
And this is the labyrinth.

239
00:35:32,431 --> 00:35:37,009
All that is not evil is exiled to the labyrinth.

240
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:39,643
Look!

241
00:35:49,573 --> 00:35:54,152
- Who is that gentleman?
- That is a Grand Grotesque.

242
00:35:54,328 --> 00:35:58,326
That's the classic way of ending life in the labyrinth.

243
00:36:01,919 --> 00:36:07,209
Professor Ping, have you ever heard of Duran Duran?

244
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:13,758
Duran Duran from Earth? Yes, indeed.

245
00:36:13,931 --> 00:36:18,059
- He's alive? Where?
- In Sogo, no doubt.

246
00:36:18,227 --> 00:36:20,599
I must go there at once.

247
00:36:21,814 --> 00:36:26,606
But as you've seen, no one may leave the labyrinth.

248
00:36:26,777 --> 00:36:31,937
- I have a spaceship, if only it worked.
- My child, perhaps I can help you.

249
00:36:32,116 --> 00:36:36,528
If only you could... Let me take you there.

250
00:36:36,703 --> 00:36:39,491
Pygar, will you show us the way?

251
00:37:14,074 --> 00:37:19,780
- What seems to be the trouble?
- I think it's the stabilizers.

252
00:37:19,955 --> 00:37:21,864
Let's have a look.

253
00:37:29,465 --> 00:37:31,623
Pygar, pen...

254
00:37:34,678 --> 00:37:37,845
Here... Thank you.

255
00:37:39,767 --> 00:37:43,136
Thank heaven the hypodontical molecules are undamaged.

256
00:37:43,312 --> 00:37:48,602
- Will it take long?
- Hours? Days? Weeks?

257
00:37:48,776 --> 00:37:50,318
Who knows?

258
00:37:50,486 --> 00:37:53,356
Genius is mysterious.

259
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:56,282
I can't wait weeks.

260
00:37:58,327 --> 00:37:59,702
Pygar?

261
00:38:01,705 --> 00:38:05,785
- You can fly me there.
- No, I can't.

262
00:38:05,959 --> 00:38:08,367
Atrophy of the greater alea muscle.

263
00:38:08,545 --> 00:38:11,997
The angel is aerodynamically sound.

264
00:38:14,885 --> 00:38:17,886
It's all a question of morale.

265
00:38:22,684 --> 00:38:28,271
There's nothing to do but wait. Pygar, where do you live?

266
00:38:29,483 --> 00:38:32,686
Come. I'll tell you how to lead me.

267
00:38:39,118 --> 00:38:42,569
- Just ahead.
- It's a nest.

268
00:38:43,622 --> 00:38:47,834
- Why, yes. That's where I live.
- It's marvelous.

269
00:38:49,503 --> 00:38:51,412
I'm glad you like it.

270
00:38:55,008 --> 00:38:57,546
Wait! They're coming.

271
00:39:06,979 --> 00:39:08,556
Help!

272
00:39:10,983 --> 00:39:12,477
Pygar, right in front of you.

273
00:39:14,862 --> 00:39:17,816
Pygar, no, to the right.

274
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,614
Now!

275
00:39:30,169 --> 00:39:35,792
- What is it?
- One of Great Tyrant's Black Guards.

276
00:39:35,966 --> 00:39:41,802
- There isn't anybody in there.
- No, Black Guards are leathermen.

277
00:39:41,972 --> 00:39:44,973
They're without fleshy substance.

278
00:39:47,478 --> 00:39:50,265
Pygar, you saved my life.

279
00:40:12,294 --> 00:40:13,954
Pygar?

280
00:40:15,422 --> 00:40:18,542
Pygar... Oh, Pygar!

281
00:40:18,717 --> 00:40:20,793
Be careful!

282
00:40:22,346 --> 00:40:24,220
Oh, Pygar!

283
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:29,801
Interesting therapy!

284
00:40:42,491 --> 00:40:46,192
- I've regained the will to fly.
- I know.

285
00:40:47,329 --> 00:40:51,030
Oh, it was... It was just heavenly.

286
00:40:52,167 --> 00:40:55,999
- Can you take me to Sogo?
- But I cannot see.

287
00:40:56,171 --> 00:40:59,754
- I will be your eyes, Pygar.
- I do not believe it is possible.

288
00:40:59,925 --> 00:41:03,092
We'll be shot down by Black Guard patrols.

289
00:41:03,262 --> 00:41:06,465
Not with my mini-missile projector, we won't.

290
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:56,887
- Are you all right, Pygar?
- Yes, thank you.

291
00:42:18,921 --> 00:42:20,296
I don't like the looks of that.

292
00:42:41,568 --> 00:42:43,228
A little to the right.

293
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:56,201
Pygar, watch out!

294
00:43:03,799 --> 00:43:05,377
I got him!

295
00:43:08,929 --> 00:43:10,969
To the right!

296
00:43:40,711 --> 00:43:43,831
Up, Pygar, up...

297
00:43:57,436 --> 00:43:59,761
We can hide behind that mountain.

298
00:44:04,485 --> 00:44:05,943
Pygar!

299
00:44:11,575 --> 00:44:13,069
Pygar!

300
00:44:44,358 --> 00:44:46,730
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

301
00:45:15,389 --> 00:45:18,722
Just in time. My energy box is completely dead.

302
00:45:18,892 --> 00:45:20,719
Are we all right now?

303
00:45:21,979 --> 00:45:25,430
I think so. Excuse me.

304
00:45:36,869 --> 00:45:40,238
We're there! It's right below us.

305
00:45:40,414 --> 00:45:43,699
We must land in a back street, for your sake.

306
00:45:43,876 --> 00:45:47,327
To be seen in Sogo with an angel would be anathema.

307
00:45:52,342 --> 00:45:55,012
Pygar, keep your head down.

308
00:46:25,876 --> 00:46:31,712
Oh my, we must find something to hide your wings.

309
00:46:52,236 --> 00:46:54,145
Wait, Barbarella!

310
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:05,331
- Don't be afraid, Pygar.
- I sense danger. Guard yourself.

311
00:47:07,835 --> 00:47:11,453
There's nothing. I promise you. Come!

312
00:47:36,989 --> 00:47:38,946
Barbarella!

313
00:47:39,116 --> 00:47:41,239
Pygar, wait for me!

314
00:47:43,287 --> 00:47:45,575
What do you want of me?

315
00:47:48,042 --> 00:47:49,417
Oh!

316
00:47:58,552 --> 00:48:01,588
Hello, pretty-pretty.

317
00:48:03,682 --> 00:48:05,057
Hello.

318
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:11,439
Thank you very much.

319
00:48:11,607 --> 00:48:15,106
Do you want to come and play with me?

320
00:48:15,277 --> 00:48:18,444
For someone like you I charge nothing.

321
00:48:23,118 --> 00:48:26,155
You're very pretty, pretty-pretty.

322
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:29,331
My name isn't "Pretty-Pretty". It's Barbarella.

323
00:48:45,265 --> 00:48:50,058
- Have you seen an angel anywhere?
- The strange bird?

324
00:48:50,229 --> 00:48:51,604
Yes.

325
00:49:01,573 --> 00:49:04,111
What's that screaming?

326
00:49:04,284 --> 00:49:07,819
A good many dramatic situations begin with screaming.

327
00:49:31,937 --> 00:49:33,479
Pygar!

328
00:49:44,658 --> 00:49:46,033
Poor Pygar...

329
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:01,333
Pygar, back up. There's a room behind you.

330
00:50:18,317 --> 00:50:20,642
They're not following.

331
00:50:22,821 --> 00:50:25,526
Pygar, come.

332
00:50:27,618 --> 00:50:30,025
Tell me what that means.

333
00:50:30,537 --> 00:50:34,915
"Chamber of Ultimate...

334
00:50:38,379 --> 00:50:40,252
...Solution".

335
00:50:40,422 --> 00:50:42,379
I don't like the sound of that.

336
00:50:48,347 --> 00:50:50,589
We'd better get out of here.

337
00:50:53,811 --> 00:50:56,681
Ye who have chosen to die, be welcome.

338
00:50:56,855 --> 00:51:02,609
To terminate the bitterness of Ilfe, you may select from three exciting...

339
00:51:02,778 --> 00:51:05,613
...and surprising forms of death.

340
00:51:05,781 --> 00:51:10,490
One of each awaits behind the doors you see before you.

341
00:51:10,661 --> 00:51:16,082
If you fail to choose, you'll be given to the Mathmos. There is no appeal.

342
00:51:17,751 --> 00:51:19,827
Next solution.

343
00:51:47,114 --> 00:51:49,652
Next solution.

344
00:51:49,825 --> 00:51:51,864
We'd better take the chance.

345
00:52:07,009 --> 00:52:09,001
Wait!

346
00:52:18,854 --> 00:52:21,606
Thank you very much.

347
00:52:22,816 --> 00:52:25,058
You must come with me.

348
00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:31,150
What is your name? What do you do in life?

349
00:52:31,325 --> 00:52:34,160
I'm Concierge to the Great Tyrant.

350
00:52:34,328 --> 00:52:38,278
- I congratulate you on your timing.
- That wasn't me.

351
00:52:38,457 --> 00:52:42,585
- That was ordained by the Great Tyrant.
- I see.

352
00:52:42,753 --> 00:52:46,252
What is that horrible thing under the floor?

353
00:52:48,717 --> 00:52:52,667
- That is the Mathmos, my child.
- The Mathmos?

354
00:52:52,846 --> 00:52:56,465
You really are from Earth. You don't understand.

355
00:52:56,642 --> 00:52:59,975
- No.
- The Mathmos...

356
00:53:00,145 --> 00:53:03,977
The whole city is built over a lake.

357
00:53:04,149 --> 00:53:08,942
A very curious lake. Composed like you and I of living energy...

358
00:53:09,113 --> 00:53:11,686
...but energy in liquid form.

359
00:53:11,865 --> 00:53:14,191
And it watches us.

360
00:53:16,036 --> 00:53:23,166
It is magnetic. Being positively charged, it feeds on negative psychic vibrations.

361
00:53:23,335 --> 00:53:25,826
What you would call "evil".

362
00:53:26,004 --> 00:53:32,374
It thrives on evil thoughts, deeds and flesh.

363
00:53:32,553 --> 00:53:35,838
In return, it gives us warmth, light and life itself.

364
00:53:36,014 --> 00:53:39,798
But it has a terrible appetite.

365
00:53:40,602 --> 00:53:43,603
Perhaps you'll see some other time.

366
00:53:44,648 --> 00:53:46,356
Pygar! Pygar!

367
00:53:46,525 --> 00:53:50,190
Don't be concerned. You'll see him again soon.

368
00:53:50,362 --> 00:53:53,233
Now, if you'll just come this way.

369
00:53:54,283 --> 00:53:59,324
Here, sit. I'm afraid you must do as I say.

370
00:54:02,332 --> 00:54:04,290
There, sit.

371
00:54:05,335 --> 00:54:08,455
Forward... Please.

372
00:54:17,139 --> 00:54:18,966
- Oh, Moxys...
- What?

373
00:54:19,141 --> 00:54:22,474
Look, Moxys. The earthling.

374
00:54:22,644 --> 00:54:25,135
You get her. Get her now.

375
00:54:25,314 --> 00:54:30,474
The Concierge will never let us. He always spoils our fun. Let's try anyway.

376
00:54:50,089 --> 00:54:52,710
- Play with us, earthling.
- You must play with us.

377
00:54:52,883 --> 00:54:56,584
- We have lots of dolls.
- My God, what are they doing here?

378
00:54:56,762 --> 00:55:00,297
Stomoxys and Glossina are nieces of the Great Tyrant.

379
00:55:00,474 --> 00:55:02,716
They're highly favored in our court.

380
00:55:02,893 --> 00:55:05,349
- Why not with us?
- That's not fair.

381
00:55:05,521 --> 00:55:08,724
- The Great Tyrant goes first, children.
- We saw her first.

382
00:55:08,899 --> 00:55:13,111
- Be good, girls.
- Stomoxys, Glossina... stay by me.

383
00:55:32,339 --> 00:55:35,257
So, my pretty-pretty, we meet again.

384
00:55:56,947 --> 00:56:00,446
You...! The little one-eyed wench.

385
00:56:00,617 --> 00:56:03,571
You have a good memory, Pretty-Pretty.

386
00:56:03,746 --> 00:56:08,407
Sometimes I like to go among my people... be like them.

387
00:56:08,584 --> 00:56:12,795
Ordinary. Evil, as you call it.

388
00:56:15,007 --> 00:56:19,087
So, I'm your little one-eyed wench.

389
00:56:19,261 --> 00:56:22,926
I'm also the Great Tyrant.

390
00:56:23,098 --> 00:56:27,594
- Well, that's nice.
- It amuses me immensely.

391
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:32,432
Now, you want some privileged information about a certain man, yes?

392
00:56:32,608 --> 00:56:38,148
Yes, I'm here on the orders of the President of the Republic of Earth.

393
00:56:38,322 --> 00:56:43,743
- I'm here to find Duran Duran.
- I don't mean him, but the angel!

394
00:56:43,911 --> 00:56:47,695
- Pygar?
- Yes, Pygar.

395
00:56:47,873 --> 00:56:52,784
He has escaped the labyrinth. Crime!

396
00:56:52,961 --> 00:56:58,418
He's destroyed 12 of my Black Guards. Crime!

397
00:56:58,592 --> 00:57:04,677
And he dares to deprive me of a pleasure unique in Sogo...

398
00:57:04,848 --> 00:57:08,134
...An earthling. Crime! Crime!

399
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:13,268
- Where is Pygar?
- You want your fine-feathered friend?

400
00:57:14,358 --> 00:57:15,733
There he is.

401
00:57:26,537 --> 00:57:28,031
Pygar!

402
00:57:36,922 --> 00:57:43,969
Amusing, isn't it, Pretty-Pretty? Don't you feel like playing?

403
00:57:44,138 --> 00:57:46,925
Pretty-Pretty... You can play with us if you want.

404
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:52,805
- Yes, why not!
- Good, Pretty-Pretty.

405
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:56,930
The Mathmos is having its effect on you already.

406
00:57:59,611 --> 00:58:04,439
It's the fumes. They make one want to play.

407
00:58:09,788 --> 00:58:11,532
- Decrucify the angel!
- What?

408
00:58:11,707 --> 00:58:14,743
Decrucify him or I'll melt your face!

409
00:58:24,636 --> 00:58:28,219
My face! My beautiful face...

410
00:58:28,932 --> 00:58:32,052
- Stop or I'll shoot.
- Stop!

411
00:58:32,227 --> 00:58:34,600
- My face!
- I warn you.

412
00:58:35,731 --> 00:58:38,981
How dare you endanger my face!

413
00:58:40,903 --> 00:58:44,236
Observe her power buckle, Your Majesty.

414
00:58:45,532 --> 00:58:49,660
Depleted. This weapon is as harmless as a child's toy.

415
00:58:52,664 --> 00:58:58,288
So, it was a trick, was it? You should have saved your tricks for...

416
00:58:58,462 --> 00:59:02,958
- For the birds, Your Majesty?
- Yes, the birds.

417
00:59:03,133 --> 00:59:06,087
The birds. Give it to the birds.

418
00:59:07,304 --> 00:59:09,213
You must...

419
00:59:27,783 --> 00:59:31,401
Tell me, my fancy, fuzzy freak.

420
00:59:31,578 --> 00:59:34,828
What do you think of when you make love to Barbarella?

421
00:59:34,998 --> 00:59:38,617
Make love? I do not understand.

422
00:59:38,794 --> 00:59:42,922
Don't be coy with me. You are in no position.

423
00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:46,755
If only you had one eye, you would see what a delight I am.

424
00:59:46,927 --> 00:59:49,679
My face, my body.

425
00:59:49,847 --> 00:59:52,801
All my things are a delight.

426
00:59:53,726 --> 00:59:56,513
An exquisite delight.

427
00:59:57,688 --> 01:00:01,638
- What is it you want?
- I shall share my delights with you.

428
01:00:01,817 --> 01:00:04,438
You shall make love to me.

429
01:00:06,447 --> 01:00:10,029
An angel doesn't make love. An angel is love.

430
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,323
Then you're a dead duck.

431
01:00:12,494 --> 01:00:13,870
Guards!

432
01:00:15,914 --> 01:00:18,750
To the Mathmos with this winged fruitcake.

433
01:00:32,097 --> 01:00:36,177
Come along... Get inside.

434
01:00:54,119 --> 01:00:58,247
Oh, how darling. Oh, my...

435
01:01:20,354 --> 01:01:22,643
Help!

436
01:01:25,859 --> 01:01:27,318
Help!

437
01:01:31,865 --> 01:01:34,154
This is really much too poetic a way to die.

438
01:02:00,018 --> 01:02:04,265
- Password, quickly.
- I don't understand.

439
01:02:06,984 --> 01:02:10,400
- You're a political prisoner?
- I don't think so.

440
01:02:11,321 --> 01:02:14,987
- Are you not one of us?
- I'm from Earth.

441
01:02:15,159 --> 01:02:20,948
Earth...? Planet of the Revolutions. Will you join our cause?

442
01:02:21,123 --> 01:02:23,792
What cause? Who are you?

443
01:02:25,002 --> 01:02:30,423
I'm Dildano, head of the Revolutionary Forces. This is our headquarters.

444
01:02:34,678 --> 01:02:36,303
- Long live the Revolution!
- The Revolution!

445
01:02:36,472 --> 01:02:37,966
Patrol report.

446
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:48,476
Second level immediately... No, take the secret passage.

447
01:03:05,209 --> 01:03:06,786
The door!

448
01:03:15,761 --> 01:03:17,919
Are you typical of earth women?

449
01:03:20,265 --> 01:03:21,641
I'm about average.

450
01:03:23,352 --> 01:03:28,061
- How did I get out of the bird cage?
- Through a secret escape chute.

451
01:03:28,232 --> 01:03:34,068
We've established secret escape chutes throughout the city.

452
01:03:40,744 --> 01:03:43,615
It's for the protection of our group.

453
01:03:47,543 --> 01:03:52,584
- You realize you saved my life.
- A life without cause is without effect.

454
01:03:53,424 --> 01:03:55,630
I'm sure my government would repay you.

455
01:03:58,262 --> 01:04:01,595
Earthwoman, shall I tell you what I would like?

456
01:04:03,851 --> 01:04:06,139
I think I know.

457
01:04:12,901 --> 01:04:19,105
No! Not like that. Like on earth... the pill.

458
01:04:19,283 --> 01:04:22,284
- I have the pill!
- But...

459
01:04:27,916 --> 01:04:32,246
Couldn't we do it your way? I don't want to change your traditions.

460
01:04:32,421 --> 01:04:34,330
I'm not a savage.

461
01:04:41,972 --> 01:04:44,843
- The pill.
- Right.

462
01:04:46,894 --> 01:04:49,467
Five years I've waited for this experience.

463
01:04:50,355 --> 01:04:51,814
Wait!

464
01:05:52,251 --> 01:05:54,160
Long live the Revolution!

465
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:02,172
My group must...

466
01:06:19,945 --> 01:06:21,985
Hello!

467
01:06:24,199 --> 01:06:25,741
Sorry!

468
01:06:32,249 --> 01:06:34,123
My group must have more...

469
01:07:13,082 --> 01:07:18,158
Where did you get those pills? Only Earth people know of those pills.

470
01:07:24,843 --> 01:07:27,132
You there... What news?

471
01:07:27,304 --> 01:07:31,432
My group must have more weapons before we can launch an attack.

472
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:35,929
- Back to position. Await your orders.
- Right.

473
01:07:38,148 --> 01:07:43,487
- You will receive your orders!
- Long live the Revolution!

474
01:07:43,654 --> 01:07:46,026
The door... the door... Door!

475
01:07:52,704 --> 01:07:56,536
You must tell me! Did an earth person give you those pills?

476
01:07:56,709 --> 01:08:01,002
- A man called Duran Duran?
- That's correct.

477
01:08:01,171 --> 01:08:04,623
- Where is he?
- He gave me the pills when he arrived.

478
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:09,011
Haven't see him since. I think he's alive... probably in the castle.

479
01:08:09,179 --> 01:08:13,307
- Do you have anything I can...
- Of course, have a secret uniform.

480
01:08:13,475 --> 01:08:14,851
Thank you.

481
01:08:17,438 --> 01:08:20,641
I was sent here by my government to find Duran Duran.

482
01:08:20,816 --> 01:08:23,141
Your government...?

483
01:08:23,318 --> 01:08:29,439
That must mean that you have a spacecraft and weapons.

484
01:08:29,616 --> 01:08:33,032
Yes, of course... I don't like this red.

485
01:08:33,203 --> 01:08:35,955
Would you lend your equipment to our cause?

486
01:08:36,123 --> 01:08:40,915
No, I couldn't do that. Not till I've completed my own mission.

487
01:08:48,427 --> 01:08:53,385
- Perhaps we can strike a bargain.
- What do you mean?

488
01:08:54,683 --> 01:08:57,933
Only the Black Queen knows the whereabouts of Duran Duran.

489
01:08:58,103 --> 01:09:02,730
Her one vulnerable moment is when she's in her secret Chamber of Dreams.

490
01:09:03,901 --> 01:09:06,356
- Chamber of Dreams?
- Yes.

491
01:09:06,528 --> 01:09:09,897
She sleeps alone in a room above the Mathmos...

492
01:09:10,074 --> 01:09:13,988
...surrounded by a wall of energy, to which she has a secret key.

493
01:09:14,161 --> 01:09:20,531
There is, however, a second key, which is now in my possession.

494
01:09:20,709 --> 01:09:25,620
You want to find Duran Duran. I want to capture the Black Queen.

495
01:09:25,798 --> 01:09:28,371
You follow my meaning?

496
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:32,963
If you really have a second key, why haven't you used it already?

497
01:09:38,018 --> 01:09:40,307
Because our forces are not yet strong enough.

498
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:46,482
To capture the Black Queen, we need to have a military coup.

499
01:09:46,652 --> 01:09:48,941
We can do this with your weaponry and spacecraft.

500
01:09:49,113 --> 01:09:53,241
Get control of the Black Queen and you'll know where to find Duran Duran.

501
01:09:53,409 --> 01:09:55,200
- Yes, I see.
- Good.

502
01:09:56,662 --> 01:09:59,616
I need six hours to ready my attack.

503
01:10:01,166 --> 01:10:05,793
First, we need to reach Professor Ping to find out if Alpha 7 has been repaired.

504
01:10:05,963 --> 01:10:09,961
Easily done. I have a secret radio transmitter.

505
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:27,894
Professor Ping to Headquarters... Professor Ping to Headquarters.

506
01:10:28,068 --> 01:10:30,524
- Professor Ping to Headquar...
- No!

507
01:10:30,696 --> 01:10:34,065
Headquarters to Professor Ping... Headquarters to Professor Ping.

508
01:10:34,241 --> 01:10:37,277
- Come in, please.
- This is Ping. I hear you loud and clear.

509
01:10:37,453 --> 01:10:39,944
- I have the earthling...
- Barbarella.

510
01:10:40,122 --> 01:10:44,285
...Barbarella with me. We can use her spacecraft and weaponry.

511
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:51,458
- Is her spacecraft in working order?
- Yes, the craft is ready for flight now.

512
01:10:53,177 --> 01:10:56,261
- Excellent!
- There is one danger, however.

513
01:10:56,430 --> 01:11:00,759
A Black Guard patroller spotted the craft and may return to destroy it.

514
01:11:00,934 --> 01:11:03,093
Good heavens!

515
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:07,897
I have programmed the craft to go a hidden location outside the labyrinth.

516
01:11:08,067 --> 01:11:12,064
- You're a wizard, Ping.
- It's taking off even now.

517
01:11:12,237 --> 01:11:16,021
There it goes. Perfect flight pattern.

518
01:11:17,451 --> 01:11:24,118
Our rendez-vous point is 1600 hours. Our password is...

519
01:11:24,291 --> 01:11:27,956
"Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrn- drobwllllantysiliogogogoch."

520
01:11:28,128 --> 01:11:29,504
You mean the secret is...

521
01:11:29,671 --> 01:11:32,542
"Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrn- drobwllllantysiliogogogoch."

522
01:11:32,716 --> 01:11:34,092
Exactly!

523
01:11:36,512 --> 01:11:38,504
- Right?
- Right.

524
01:11:40,015 --> 01:11:43,680
Headquarters signing off. Headquarters signing off.

525
01:11:57,741 --> 01:12:00,778
The time is right. The Queen is in her Chamber of Dreams.

526
01:12:00,953 --> 01:12:04,203
- What about the key?
- The key!

527
01:12:10,129 --> 01:12:13,248
- There is the secret key.
- Where?

528
01:12:14,466 --> 01:12:19,508
It's invisible. Only an invisible key can open an invisible wall.

529
01:12:25,018 --> 01:12:26,394
Where?

530
01:12:30,482 --> 01:12:33,602
My Mathmos... the key!

531
01:12:37,948 --> 01:12:39,407
The key...

532
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:44,947
I have it!

533
01:12:54,506 --> 01:12:57,543
I'll put it around your secret neck.

534
01:13:02,222 --> 01:13:03,717
Invisible.

535
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:12,433
Now, the secret map that will lead you to the 12th corridor.

536
01:13:13,275 --> 01:13:14,935
What corridor?

537
01:13:19,656 --> 01:13:21,115
Good!

538
01:13:22,326 --> 01:13:23,701
This way!

539
01:13:34,046 --> 01:13:38,708
"Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrn- drobwllllantysiliogogogoch."

540
01:13:40,010 --> 01:13:41,754
Long live the Revolution!

541
01:13:47,017 --> 01:13:48,392
One moment.

542
01:14:19,508 --> 01:14:22,081
I'm just not the tube type.

543
01:15:11,018 --> 01:15:15,727
Excuse me. Could you tell me how to get to the 12th corridor?

544
01:15:27,785 --> 01:15:30,026
I have a taste for you.

545
01:15:44,218 --> 01:15:47,634
- What is it?
- Essence of Man.

546
01:15:48,263 --> 01:15:50,303
Essence of Man?

547
01:16:05,948 --> 01:16:08,699
So, you escaped the birds!

548
01:16:09,493 --> 01:16:14,404
Just as well. It is my turn for some amusement.

549
01:16:14,581 --> 01:16:16,408
Come with me.

550
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:20,118
This way, please!

551
01:17:07,634 --> 01:17:11,679
- What is this thing?
- You will soon see, my dear.

552
01:17:11,847 --> 01:17:16,224
"Sonata for Executioner and Various Young Women".

553
01:17:20,105 --> 01:17:24,317
It's... sort of nice, isn't it?

554
01:17:24,485 --> 01:17:28,778
Yes. It is nice... In the beginning.

555
01:17:35,204 --> 01:17:40,245
Wait until the tune changes. It may change your tune as well.

556
01:17:40,834 --> 01:17:43,871
Goodness, what do you mean?

557
01:17:58,143 --> 01:18:02,473
When we reach the crescendo, you will die... of pleasure.

558
01:18:02,648 --> 01:18:06,432
Your end will be swift, but sweet... very sweet.

559
01:19:47,044 --> 01:19:50,744
What is this? I don't believe it.

560
01:19:50,923 --> 01:19:52,465
It couldn't be!

561
01:19:53,008 --> 01:19:57,172
Wretched girl... What have you done to my excessive machine?

562
01:19:57,346 --> 01:20:01,046
You've undone it. You've undone me. Look, look!

563
01:20:01,725 --> 01:20:05,770
Energy cables are shrinking. You've turned them into faggots.

564
01:20:05,938 --> 01:20:11,478
You've burned out the excessive machine. You've blown all its fuses.

565
01:20:11,652 --> 01:20:13,312
My goodness!

566
01:20:13,487 --> 01:20:17,948
You've exhausted its power. It couldn't keep up with you.

567
01:20:19,201 --> 01:20:24,575
Incredible! What kind of girl are you? Have you no shame?

568
01:20:28,544 --> 01:20:33,538
Shame! Shame on you! You'll pay for this.

569
01:20:35,134 --> 01:20:40,674
I've got something for you. You'll wish you had died of pleasure.

570
01:20:40,848 --> 01:20:43,339
Now you shall learn the wisdom of the lash.

571
01:20:43,517 --> 01:20:46,138
Haven't you done enough to me?

572
01:20:46,311 --> 01:20:50,808
I'll do things to you that are beyond all known philosophies.

573
01:20:50,983 --> 01:20:53,556
Wait until I get my devices.

574
01:21:09,752 --> 01:21:11,127
Duran Duran?

575
01:21:24,391 --> 01:21:28,175
Oh, recognized me?

576
01:21:29,396 --> 01:21:31,104
Recognized you?

577
01:21:31,273 --> 01:21:36,860
I'd never have recognized you. I thought you were only 25. What happened?

578
01:21:37,029 --> 01:21:41,607
- The Mathmos is not without its effect.
- But you've aged 30 years!

579
01:21:41,784 --> 01:21:47,620
The Mathmos has its own means of nourishment. In return, it teaches truth.

580
01:21:47,790 --> 01:21:51,372
Dr. Duran, could you hand me a garment?

581
01:21:52,294 --> 01:21:57,039
The President of the Republic of Earth sent me here to save you.

582
01:21:57,216 --> 01:22:00,798
- And to return you to Earth.
- Earth planet? Never!

583
01:22:00,969 --> 01:22:04,552
Shall I tell you why? Because I know too much.

584
01:22:04,723 --> 01:22:07,641
Here in Sogo I have learned truth and essence.

585
01:22:07,810 --> 01:22:11,642
I speak of the dignity, the nobility of pure Evil.

586
01:22:11,814 --> 01:22:14,387
My boots, please.

587
01:22:14,566 --> 01:22:18,944
Humanism! Morals! Principles...! It's rubbish! Nonsense!

588
01:22:19,113 --> 01:22:21,651
I speak only of truth and of essence.

589
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:25,952
- Where is the Positronic Ray?
- So, that's it.

590
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:28,361
What does it do?

591
01:22:28,539 --> 01:22:34,707
All persons and objects within its path are de-miniminized to the 4th level.

592
01:22:34,878 --> 01:22:36,752
- You mean...?
- That's right.

593
01:22:36,922 --> 01:22:41,335
Replaced in the 4th dimension irretrievably.

594
01:22:41,510 --> 01:22:46,136
- But that's monstrous!
- Yes, it is. Isn't it?

595
01:22:46,306 --> 01:22:48,797
Why didn't you take power here in Sogo?

596
01:22:48,976 --> 01:22:51,348
The Black Queen must first be destroyed.

597
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:56,312
But as you know, she is always surrounded by her Black Guards.

598
01:22:56,483 --> 01:23:00,896
Whoever succeeds in killing her will be put immediately to a horrible death.

599
01:23:01,071 --> 01:23:03,313
Hence, my prudence.

600
01:23:04,533 --> 01:23:10,156
I find horrible the idea that one could do to me that which I do to others.

601
01:23:10,330 --> 01:23:14,791
But I was told the Black Queen is vulnerable while she sleeps.

602
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:18,578
Oh, yes. There are no Black Guards in the Chamber of Dreams.

603
01:23:18,756 --> 01:23:21,543
That's because there's no access to the Chamber.

604
01:23:21,717 --> 01:23:26,462
But, now's time for my pleasure... and your death.

605
01:23:27,639 --> 01:23:29,015
Wait!

606
01:23:31,852 --> 01:23:34,888
I know how you can enter the Chamber of Dreams.

607
01:23:35,064 --> 01:23:39,310
- How? Speak!
- I have the key.

608
01:23:41,528 --> 01:23:44,613
- What does it look like?
- It's invisible.

609
01:23:52,289 --> 01:23:55,041
Take me to the Chamber of Dreams.

610
01:23:56,085 --> 01:23:58,658
After you, Barbarella.

611
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:21,937
To the right, Barbarella...

612
01:24:23,237 --> 01:24:24,861
Now, to the left...

613
01:24:26,657 --> 01:24:28,032
Stop.

614
01:24:29,535 --> 01:24:31,077
Open it!

615
01:24:37,209 --> 01:24:41,538
- This must be the invisible wall.
- Yes. Now, where's the key?

616
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:51,885
- Come on, stop stalling.
- I'm trying to find the keyhole.

617
01:25:12,202 --> 01:25:15,571
You're trapped. You're trapped in the Chamber of Dreams.

618
01:25:15,748 --> 01:25:18,784
- The Mathmos will devour you.
- Your Majesty!

619
01:25:18,959 --> 01:25:24,962
It's no use. I've got the two keys. The wall's sealed for all eternity.

620
01:25:25,132 --> 01:25:27,919
Dr. Duran, give up this madness!

621
01:25:28,093 --> 01:25:34,630
- Return to Earth with me now.
- I'll return to Earth, but as its conqueror!

622
01:25:34,808 --> 01:25:40,395
Thanks to you, the Queen, my last obstacle, has been removed.

623
01:25:40,564 --> 01:25:42,936
Thank you, Barbarella.

624
01:25:45,819 --> 01:25:50,446
Nothing can stop me now. Today, Master of Sogo...

625
01:25:50,616 --> 01:25:57,365
Tomorrow, Master of the Earth, Master of the Galaxy, Master of the Universe!

626
01:26:16,225 --> 01:26:22,393
Tell me, my fine, feathered friend, what do you think of...

627
01:26:22,564 --> 01:26:25,316
...when you make love to Barbarella?

628
01:26:26,819 --> 01:26:31,315
An angel doesn't make love. An angel is love.

629
01:27:45,647 --> 01:27:49,479
Wake up, Your Majesty! You must wake up.

630
01:27:51,820 --> 01:27:56,529
Vade retro, Earthgirl! I know you don't really exist.

631
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:59,452
That may be, Your Majesty. But we'd better stick to what we see.

632
01:28:01,538 --> 01:28:06,414
Wretched girl, what have you done? No one must enter while I sleep.

633
01:28:06,585 --> 01:28:09,871
Your Concierge is taking over the throne.

634
01:28:11,006 --> 01:28:15,502
- What are you saying?
- It's true. He's taken your key.

635
01:28:18,889 --> 01:28:25,093
- We're locked in, Your Majesty.
- The key. He's stolen the key!

636
01:28:25,270 --> 01:28:29,482
We are doomed... Doomed!

637
01:28:33,362 --> 01:28:37,691
He said the Mathmos would devour us. What did he mean?

638
01:28:39,618 --> 01:28:45,123
It is said that unless I am alone in my Chamber of Dreams...

639
01:28:45,290 --> 01:28:47,082
...the Mathmos will claim me.

640
01:28:55,843 --> 01:29:00,588
- It's the throne room.
- I can see all of the City and labyrinth.

641
01:29:00,764 --> 01:29:03,302
Unfortunately, it's a one-way screen.

642
01:29:03,475 --> 01:29:06,761
No one can see that bloody dog has locked me in.

643
01:29:06,937 --> 01:29:11,979
Your Majesty! We're under attack. The creatures in the labyrinth.

644
01:29:12,151 --> 01:29:14,357
They're revolting!

645
01:29:14,528 --> 01:29:19,902
How dare he interrupt my coronation! Dispatch the air armada!

646
01:29:22,661 --> 01:29:24,535
Quick, Your Majesty, the labyrinth.

647
01:29:28,250 --> 01:29:32,164
It's Dildano. He will save us.

648
01:30:03,118 --> 01:30:07,614
- Your Majesty, they're all destroyed.
- Good.

649
01:30:07,790 --> 01:30:10,993
- Not a creature left in the labyrinth.
- No aircraft left!

650
01:30:11,168 --> 01:30:13,659
They have Earth weapons!

651
01:30:15,172 --> 01:30:21,045
Fool! Liar! Idiots! Must I do everything myself?

652
01:30:22,679 --> 01:30:27,009
- I must destroy this rabble.
- He'll use the Positronic Ray.

653
01:31:07,391 --> 01:31:09,134
It works!

654
01:31:10,477 --> 01:31:12,968
It works... It works.

655
01:31:32,958 --> 01:31:34,333
All is lost.

656
01:31:36,420 --> 01:31:42,672
I must die, very well, but it is I who shall have the last laugh.

657
01:31:42,843 --> 01:31:46,426
The imbecile doesn't know the secret of the Great Tyrant.

658
01:31:46,597 --> 01:31:52,137
The supreme weapon. I shall free the Mathmos.

659
01:31:52,311 --> 01:31:56,309
- Do you think that's wise?
- Sogo will disappear.

660
01:31:57,608 --> 01:32:01,024
It will be the end. The Apocalypse!

661
01:32:34,478 --> 01:32:38,013
- Where are we?
- In the Mathmos. And alive!

662
01:32:38,190 --> 01:32:39,815
I can see that, but why?

663
01:32:39,983 --> 01:32:45,737
The Mathmos created this bubble to protect itself from your innocence.

664
01:32:45,906 --> 01:32:47,281
That's nice.

665
01:32:54,623 --> 01:32:57,659
No, no, stop! I command it.

666
01:32:57,835 --> 01:32:59,412
I'm Duran Duran.

667
01:33:03,006 --> 01:33:04,964
I'm Master of the Mathmos.

668
01:33:08,595 --> 01:33:10,588
Fall back!

669
01:33:10,764 --> 01:33:12,140
Fall back!

670
01:33:14,268 --> 01:33:18,100
I'll destroy you with my Positronic Ray.

671
01:33:42,296 --> 01:33:45,166
You're so good, you make the Mathmos vomit.

672
01:33:45,340 --> 01:33:47,214
Pygar! What did you do to Pygar?

673
01:33:47,384 --> 01:33:52,509
He was sent to the Mathmos, but was no more digestible than you are.

674
01:33:52,681 --> 01:33:54,389
You can't be dead.

675
01:33:55,809 --> 01:34:00,720
You win, Barbarella. But the earth has lost its last great dictator.

676
01:34:00,898 --> 01:34:04,598
The genius of the Positronic Ray...

677
01:34:12,076 --> 01:34:15,030
Why don't you give him a mouth-to-mouth?

678
01:34:15,204 --> 01:34:17,280
I have a better idea.

679
01:34:25,339 --> 01:34:28,209
Please... Pygar, please.

680
01:34:29,802 --> 01:34:31,711
Please wake up!

681
01:34:35,891 --> 01:34:40,683
We must fly back to my spaceship. Do you have the strength?

682
01:35:21,145 --> 01:35:27,562
Pygar, why did you save her after all the terrible things she did to you?

683
01:35:27,735 --> 01:35:29,976
An angel has no memory!
