我们在一起

00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:09,652
这里是一种关于你的柯克贝壳

about you.

11
00:03:10,531 --> 00:03:14,279
芭芭丽娜

00:03:35,431 --> 00:03:38,431
在平流层之上
...above the stratosphere.

19
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,720
亲近一些
Bring your dearness near

20
00:03:41,895 --> 00:03:44,647
直到黎明来临
Till the dawn comes tumbling down

别出声

别为难你自己 这是整个国家的事
Don't trouble yourself. This is an affair of state.

38
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:29,919
我必须要说的不但重要 是一个秘密
What I must say not only is grave... It's a secret.

39
00:05:30,087 --> 00:05:31,462
秘密？
A secret?

40
00:05:32,423 --> 00:05:37,168
你曾经听说过一个叫杜兰杜兰的年轻科学家吗？
Have you ever heard of a young scientist named Duran Duran?

41
00:05:37,344 --> 00:05:40,713
- 恩，听说过
- 最近在去往北极星的途中
- Yes.
- Recently en route to the North Star...

42
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:44,175
他消失了 在Tau Ceti的未知区域
...he vanished into the uncharted regions of Tau Ceti.

43
00:05:44,351 --> 00:05:46,178
但是为什么是个秘密呢？
But... why is that a secret?

44
00:05:46,353 --> 00:05:50,849
因为杜兰杜兰是射线的发明家
Because Duran Duran is the inventor of the Positronic Ray.

45
00:05:51,024 --> 00:05:54,643
- 是一种武器
- 武器？
- It's a weapon.
- Weapon?

46
00:05:56,071 --> 00:05:58,194
为什么有些人要发明武器？
Why would anyone want to invent a weapon?

47
00:05:58,365 --> 00:06:00,025
我怎么知道？
How should I know?

48
00:06:01,952 --> 00:06:04,621
宇宙已经平静了几个世纪，先生
The universe has been pacified for centuries, sir.

49
00:06:04,788 --> 00:06:10,791
据我们所知。我们对于Tau Ceti和它的居民一无所知
As far as we know. Yet we know nothing of Tau Ceti or its inhabitants.

50
00:06:10,961 --> 00:06:13,748
他们可能仍然处于一个原始的精神不受支配的国度？
Could they still be in a primitive state of neurotic irresponsibility?

51
00:06:13,922 --> 00:06:19,083
这正是我要说的，如果他们从这个年轻的科学家身上学习到
Precisely. And If they learn from this young scientist...

52
00:06:19,261 --> 00:06:21,834
射线的秘密
...the secret of the Positronic Ray...

53
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:27,257
他们就有能力破坏宇宙这个充满爱的大家庭
...they will be able to shatter the loving union of the universe.

54
00:06:27,853 --> 00:06:33,060
- 这可能意味着陈旧的不安全感...
- 战争
- That might mean archaic insecurity...
- And war.

55
00:06:33,984 --> 00:06:38,397
- 你的意思是自私的竞争和。。
- 我是说战争
- You mean selfish competition and...
- I mean war.

56
00:06:38,572 --> 00:06:42,617
- 所有部落之间充满血腥冲突
- 我不相信
- Bloody conflict among entire tribes.
- I don't believe it.

57
00:06:42,785 --> 00:06:46,236
我也不相信  但是我们不能冒险
Neither do I. But we can't take a chance.

58
00:06:47,414 --> 00:06:52,123
- 我们必须做些什么
- 对，你就是必须阻止这些事情发生的女孩
- Something must be done.
- Yes. You're the girl who must do it.

59
00:06:52,294 --> 00:06:56,873
- 为什么是我？
- 我没有武器我也不是警察
- Why me?
- I have no armies or police.

60
00:06:57,049 --> 00:07:04,925

I can't spare the presidential band. Plus, you're a 5-star Astro-Navigatrix.

61
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:09,595
你的任务是：找到杜兰杜兰
Your mission then: Find Duran Duran...

62
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:14,479
利用你无可比拟的才能来保卫这个宇宙所有星球的安全
...and use your incomparable talents to preserve the security of the stars...

63
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,734
和你自己的星球 你觉得我怎么样？
...and our own mother planet. How do you read me?

64
00:07:17,903 --> 00:07:23,573
- 正直
- 这是一张杜兰杜兰的照片
- Straight.
- Here's the one known photo of Duran.

65
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:28,739
26岁，眼神深邃 一个相当帅的家伙
Age 26. Hazel eyes. A rather handsome fellow.

66
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:34,333
我觉得我认不出他来，先生
I don't think I'll be able to recognize him, sir.

67
00:07:34,503 --> 00:07:38,714
这个是便携式脑波探测器
Now, this is a portable brainwave detector.

68
00:07:41,885 --> 00:07:47,472
注意 把你的原子信息传导器设置到0-3-5
Attention... Set your atom transmitter at 0-3-5.

69
00:07:48,726 --> 00:07:52,095
- 一切正常

00:20:38,996 --> 00:20:41,487
你讲法语吗？
Parlez-vous francais?

133
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,116
最好调一个我的话筒
Better adjust my tongue box.

134
00:20:50,758 --> 00:20:52,133
你还好吧？
Are you all right?

135
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:57,004
还好，你是谁？
I think so... Who are you?

136
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:01,555
我是马克，汉德，逮捕者。或者翻译成 警察 你是谁？
I am Mark Hand, the catchman. And who are you?

137
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:06,852
我从地球来，告诉我你所知道的关于这个宇宙飞船的事
I'm from the Planet Earth. Tell me what you know of this spaceship.

138
00:21:07,024 --> 00:21:13,228
我什么也不知道。 在我做逮捕者之前这个飞船就已经在这里了。
I know nothing. It was here when I accepted the job of the catchman.

139
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:18,945
- 逮捕者？
- 是的，孩子们生活在冰偃
- Catchman?
- Yes. Children live on icey Weir...

140
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:22,453
知道他们到了可用的年纪
...until they have reached a serviceable age.

141
00:21:22,623 --> 00:21:26,834
- 可用的？
- 然后，我抓住他们，就像你看到的
- Serviceable?
- Then I capture them just as you saw.

142
00:21:27,002 --> 00:21:31,000
- 我把他们交给相关政局。
- 我明白了
- I turn them over to the authorities.
- I see.

143
00:21:34,218 --> 00:21:38,547
谢谢你 你听说过杜兰杜兰这个名字吗？
Thank you. Ever heard the name Duran Duran?

144
00:21:38,722 --> 00:21:45,176
没有，我独自一个人生活在冰偃 就是警察的生活
I know nothing. I live alone on icey Weir. Such is a catchman's life.

145
00:21:47,564 --> 00:21:51,265
只有在sogo你能找到这个问题的答案
Only in Sogo will you find the answer to your question.

146
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:55,227
-  sogo？在这附近吗？
- 就在冰层的上面
- Sogo? Is it near?
- It's just beyond that ice-deck.

147
00:22:02,913 --> 00:22:06,578
我刚才好像看到了你的航天器在这个湖边？
Did I see your spacecraft at the far edge of this lake?

148
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,621
是的，恐怕已经坏了
Yes, but I'm afraid it's broken down.

149
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:13,330
- 磁暴毁坏了我的稳定系统。
- 或许，我能帮上忙
- Magnetic storms ruined my stabilizer.
- Perhaps, I can help.

150
00:22:13,507 --> 00:22:21,253
我对磁的东西非常在行。 我服务并维护这个冰艇。
I'm quite experienced mechanically. I service and maintain this icecraft.

151
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:27,346
- 如果你愿意，我可以带你去你的船。
- .但是没有风
- If you wish, I'll take you to your ship.
- But there's no wind.

152
00:22:28,397 --> 00:22:29,891
抓紧了
Hold on.

153
00:22:40,117 --> 00:22:42,323
- 多可爱的机舱阿
- .风
- What a lovely cabin!
- Wind.

154
00:23:01,638 --> 00:23:05,422
太感谢你的帮助了 我该怎么感谢你呢？
I'm so grateful for your help. How can I ever thank you?

155
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:09,385
我相信我的政府会回报你的。
I'm sure my government would repay you.

156
00:23:09,563 --> 00:23:14,272
如果有什么我能帮的上忙的尽管告诉我。
If there's anything I can do, please tell me.

157
00:23:14,443 --> 00:23:17,894
你可以让我跟你做爱
You could let me make love to you.

158
00:23:18,072 --> 00:23:20,741
- 做爱？
- 恩
- Make love?
- Yes.

159
00:23:20,908 --> 00:23:24,407
你可能不知道我已经心动了
You don't even know my psycho-cardiogram.

160
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,037
在地球上人们不做爱
On earth people don't make love...

161
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:33,284
除非他们的心动是完美的汇合了
...unless their psycho-cardiograms are in perfect confluence.

162
00:23:33,462 --> 00:23:37,590
你问我你能为我做些什么，我告诉你了
You asked me what you could do for me. And I told you.

163
00:23:37,758 --> 00:23:41,376
没错 但是我没看出来这么做有什么益处
All right. But I don't see what good it will do.

164
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:43,345
- 你有药片吗？
- 药片？
- Do you have any pills?
- Pills?

165
00:23:44,181 --> 00:23:49,176
- 不要紧，我这里有一些
- 这是什么药？
- Never mind, I have some here.
- What is this pill?

166
00:23:50,854 --> 00:23:53,974
当然，是一片移情药片。（应该是类似春药的东西）
An exaltation transference pill, of course.

167
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:56,854
- 我对这个一无所知
- 看出来了
- I know nothing of this.
- I see.

168
00:23:57,027 --> 00:24:01,938
在地球上，在和谐的做爱中有有所心动
On earth when our psycho-cardiograms are in harmony for lovemaking...

169
00:24:02,116 --> 00:24:04,239
我们吃一粒移情药片
...we take an exaltation transference pill.

170
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:07,280
并且保持这样让展示给你看
And remain like this. Here let me show you.

171
00:24:08,288 --> 00:24:11,455
一分钟或直到实现全面的和谐。
For one minute or until full rapport is achieved.

172
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:25,839
我不关系那些 我的意思是床
I don't care for that. This is what I mean... the bed!

173
00:24:28,475 --> 00:24:32,722
那个？ 但是没有人做爱几个世纪
That? But nobody's done that for centuries!

174
00:24:32,896 --> 00:24:36,431
除了那些负担不起药钱的穷人或者心理有问题的
Except the poor who can't afford the pill or psycho-cardiograms.

175
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:42,029
- 为什么不？
- 它阻碍了最高效率。
- Why not?
- It impedes maximum efficiency.

176
00:24:42,197 --> 00:24:47,903
也替代了自我支持和自尊，都是先在可用的。
Also substitutes for ego support and self-esteem are now available.

177
00:24:48,078 --> 00:24:53,867
- 这么说，你不会做了？
- 如果你坚持，我想是这样的
- So, you won't do it?
- If you insist, I guess so.

178
00:24:54,543 --> 00:24:58,244
但是，像那样做真的没有什么意义。
But there's really no point at all in doing it like this.

179
00:25:04,053 --> 00:25:07,801
- 请脱下你的衣服
- 哦
- Without your garments, please.
- Oh.

180
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:06,862
现在我要看看你的稳定器。
Now I'll have a look at your stabilizers.

181
00:26:12,329 --> 00:26:17,952
知道你的衣服都脱掉了，你可以使用我的皮草， 芭芭丽娜。
Since your garment is torn, help yourself to my furs, Barbarella.

182
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:30,282
我想我知道哪里出了问题 现在你可以继续去sogo了
I think I've found the trouble. You may proceed now to Sogo.

183
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:35,989
这那里你能找到杜兰杜兰，如果他还活着
It's there you will find Duran Duran Jr. If he still lives...

184
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,414
好的
Good.

185
00:27:40,084 --> 00:27:43,453
现在，芭芭丽娜 你还不认同我
Now, Barbarella, don't you agree with me...

186
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:47,876
在一些事情上，还是老式的方法最好？
...that in some things, the old-fashioned ways are best?

187
00:27:48,801 --> 00:27:53,048
什么？  哦，那个
What...? Oh, that.

188
00:27:53,222 --> 00:27:56,970
是的，我不得不承认这一点颇为有趣。
Yes, I must admit it was rather interesting.

189
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:59,764
尽管如此，这些正在消失
Still, it is distracting.

190
00:27:59,937 --> 00:28:05,097
- 你跟我一起去sogo吗？  sogo-崇光-汗。。。
- 不，我还是喜欢平静的威尔。
- Are you coming with me to Sogo?
- No, I prefer the tranquility of Weir.

191
00:28:05,275 --> 00:28:08,229
Sogo 过于严格，人们都很专制。
Sogo is too strict, the people too dedicated.

192
00:28:08,404 --> 00:28:13,362
在你任务结束的时候你可能还会停经这里
Perhaps you'll stop here again... at the end of your mission.

193
00:28:13,534 --> 00:28:16,404
可能我会的
Yes, perhaps I will...

194
00:28:18,205 --> 00:28:21,206
好吧，再见了，再次谢谢你
Well, goodbye. And thanks again...

195
00:28:23,127 --> 00:28:24,918
为所有的事
For everything.

196
00:28:25,087 --> 00:28:27,542
都是我的荣幸
It was my pleasure.

197
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:37,803
- 请回报现在的情况
- 你不会明白的
- Please advise present situation.
- You wouldn't understand.

198
00:28:55,743 --> 00:28:59,740
- .稳定器故障
- 我已经修复了
- Stabilizer's malfunctioning.
- I've been repaired in reverse.

199
00:29:00,956 --> 00:29:03,910
我们正在进入 我要激活落地螺钉
We're going in. I'll activate the Terra screw.

200
00:29:26,774 --> 00:29:28,897
芭芭丽娜
Barbarella!

201
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:32,773
芭芭丽娜
Barbarella!

202
00:29:34,073 --> 00:29:37,073
所有的内部系统都马力充足
Full operational power on all subterranean systems.

203
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,457
45度上升
45 degree ascent.

204
00:29:49,463 --> 00:29:51,290
距离表层四分之一到二分之一之间
Quarter-to-half for surfacing.

205
00:30:23,539 --> 00:30:26,326
必须摆脱这个尾巴
Got to get rid of this tail.

206
00:31:39,865 --> 00:31:42,356
- 我完了
- 不
- I'm dead.
- No.

207
00:31:47,873 --> 00:31:52,085
- 我在哪儿？
- 夜城的迷宫
- Where am I?
- In the labyrinth of the City of Night.

208
00:31:52,252 --> 00:31:56,795
- 你是天使吗？
- 我是pygar，最后一个ornithanthrope
- Are you an angel?
- I'm Pygar, the last ornithanthrope.

209
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:02,882
- 你好
- 你好
- How do you do?
- And you?

210
00:32:04,098 --> 00:32:07,716
我从地球来 我叫芭芭丽娜
I'm from Planet Earth. My name is Barbarella.

211
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:14,264
你是柔软的温暖的 我们听说地球上的生物都是冰冷的
But you're soft and warm. We're told that earth beings are cold.

212
00:32:14,441 --> 00:32:15,935
并不是所有的
Not all of us...

213
00:32:17,236 --> 00:32:20,569
我可怜的航天器，看
My poor spaceship. Look at it.

214
00:32:22,783 --> 00:32:24,158
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

215
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:28,496
你的眼睛怎么了？
Pygar, what happened to your eyes?

216
00:32:28,664 --> 00:32:32,080
在一场磁暴中我的航天器坠落了，阻碍了我去SOGO。
I fell during a magnetic storm and was carried off to Sogo.

217
00:32:32,251 --> 00:32:33,661
Sogo?
Sogo?

218
00:32:33,836 --> 00:32:38,047
夜城被大暴君统治着，在那里他们瞧不起我
The City of Night ruled by the Great Tyrant. There they blinded me.

219
00:32:38,215 --> 00:32:41,999
我被遗弃在迷宫里等死，直到平教授发现了我。
I was left to die in the labyrinth until Professor Ping found me.

220
00:32:42,177 --> 00:32:43,969
真可怕
That's terrible.

221
00:32:48,058 --> 00:32:51,059
你真的会飞？
Can you really fly?

222
00:32:51,228 --> 00:32:53,600
不，我已经失去了飞的意愿。
No, I've lost the will to fly.

223
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:58,351
- 多么可怕
- 没事了，都过去了。
- How awful!
- It no longer matters. It's the past.

224
00:32:58,527 --> 00:33:04,363
- 你听说过杜兰杜兰吗
- 杜兰杜兰？
- Have you heard of Duran Duran?
- Duran Duran?

225
00:33:04,533 --> 00:33:08,578
是的，杜兰杜兰 他是从地球来的宇航员。
Yes, Duran Duran. He's an astronaut from Earth.

226
00:33:08,746 --> 00:33:11,450
我不知道这些事
I do not know of such things.

227
00:33:13,709 --> 00:33:17,374
- 也许平教授能帮上忙。
- 平教授？
- Perhaps Professor Ping can help.
- Professor Ping?

228
00:33:17,546 --> 00:33:20,666
他非常聪明而且知道关于SOGO的所有事情。
He's very wise and knows all about Sogo.

229
00:33:20,841 --> 00:33:25,218
- 我在哪里能找到他？
- 他正在跟别人一起吃东西。
- Where can I find him?
- He's with the others, eating.

230
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:39,534
- 他在那儿。 平教授？
- 平教授？
- He's there. Professor Ping?
- Professor Ping?

231
00:34:39,712 --> 00:34:42,547
- 是的？
- 我是芭芭丽娜。
- Yes?
- My name is Barbarella.

232
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:47,964
告诉我，你的由来是什么？
Tell me. What is your origin?

233
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:57,637
你有地球生物的特征 你是女性，对吗？
You have the aspect of an earthling. You are of female gender, right?

234
00:34:57,813 --> 00:34:59,852
是的
That is correct.

235
00:35:02,276 --> 00:35:04,849
- 那是兰花吗？
- 是的
- Is that an orchid?
- Yes.

236
00:35:05,028 --> 00:35:10,236
兰花基本没有食用价值，而且在这种气候下很难生长。
Orchids have very little food value and are hard to grow in this climate.

237
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:16,328
兰花使大暴君心情很愉快，这样他就不会去怨恨用兰花喂养奴隶的那些花销了。
It amuses the Great Tyrant to resent the expense of feeding orchids to slaves.

238
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:24,380
- 这是什么地方？
- 那是SOGO，夜城
- What kind of place is this?
- That is Sogo, the City of Night...

239
00:35:24,548 --> 00:35:29,091
被大暴君统治，并且致力于各个方面各种形式都是邪恶的。
...ruled by the Great Tyrant and dedicated to evil in every form.

240
00:35:29,261 --> 00:35:32,262
这个是迷宫。
And this is the labyrinth.

241
00:35:32,431 --> 00:35:37,009
所有不邪恶的都流亡在这个迷宫里
All that is not evil is exiled to the labyrinth.

242
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:39,643
看
Look!

243
00:35:49,573 --> 00:35:54,152
- 那个绅士是谁？
- 那是一个大怪诞
- Who is that gentleman?
- That is a Grand Grotesque.

244
00:35:54,328 --> 00:35:58,326
这是在迷宫里结束生命的传统的方法
That's the classic way of ending life in the labyrinth.

245
00:36:01,919 --> 00:36:07,209
平教授，你听说过杜兰杜兰吗？
Professor Ping, have you ever heard of Duran Duran?

246
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:13,758
从地球来的杜兰杜兰？ 是的，没错
Duran Duran from Earth? Yes, indeed.

247
00:36:13,931 --> 00:36:18,059
- 他还活着吗？在哪儿？
- 毫无疑问，在SOGO。
- He's alive? Where?
- In Sogo, no doubt.

248
00:36:18,227 --> 00:36:20,599
我必须马上去那里
I must go there at once.

249
00:36:21,814 --> 00:36:26,606
但是正如你所见，没有人能离开迷宫
But as you've seen, no one may leave the labyrinth.

250
00:36:26,777 --> 00:36:31,937
-我有一个航天器，只要它能运转。
- 我的孩子，也许我能帮助你。
- I have a spaceship, if only it worked.
- My child, perhaps I can help you.

251
00:36:32,116 --> 00:36:36,528
如果你可以 我带你去那里
If only you could... Let me take you there.

252
00:36:36,703 --> 00:36:39,491
你能告诉我怎么走吗？
Pygar, will you show us the way?

253
00:37:14,074 --> 00:37:19,780
- 看起来有什么问题？
- 我觉得是稳定器
- What seems to be the trouble?
- I think it's the stabilizers.

254
00:37:19,955 --> 00:37:21,864
让我们看看
Let's have a look.

255
00:37:29,465 --> 00:37:31,623
Pygar, 笔
Pygar, pen...

256
00:37:34,678 --> 00:37:37,845
给你，谢谢
Here... Thank you.

257
00:37:39,767 --> 00:37:43,136
谢天谢地，hypodontical分子没被破坏
Thank heaven the hypodontical molecules are undamaged.

258
00:37:43,312 --> 00:37:48,602
- 要花费多长时间？
- 几个小时？几天？几周？
- Will it take long?
- Hours? Days? Weeks?

259
00:37:48,776 --> 00:37:50,318
谁知道？
Who knows?

260
00:37:50,486 --> 00:37:53,356
天才是神秘的
Genius is mysterious.

261
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:56,282
我等不了几周。
I can't wait weeks.

262
00:37:58,327 --> 00:37:59,702
Pygar?
Pygar?

263
00:38:01,705 --> 00:38:05,785
- 你可以带我飞过去，
- 我不能，
- You can fly me there.
- No, I can't.

264
00:38:05,959 --> 00:38:08,367
收缩更大的alea肌肉
Atrophy of the greater alea muscle.

265
00:38:08,545 --> 00:38:11,997
天使听起来是空气动力学的
The angel is aerodynamically sound.

266
00:38:14,885 --> 00:38:17,886
这是一个士气的问题。
It's all a question of morale.

267
00:38:22,684 --> 00:38:28,271
除了等待我们什么也做不了 pygar，你住在哪里？
There's nothing to do but wait. Pygar, where do you live?

268
00:38:29,483 --> 00:38:32,686
来，我告诉你怎么引导我
Come. I'll tell you how to lead me.

269
00:38:39,118 --> 00:38:42,569
- .就在前面
- 是个鸟窝
- Just ahead.
- It's a nest.

270
00:38:43,622 --> 00:38:47,834
- 为什么，是的，我就住在那里
- 太奇妙了
- Why, yes. That's where I live.
- It's marvelous.

271
00:38:49,503 --> 00:38:51,412
很高兴你喜欢它
I'm glad you like it.

272
00:38:55,008 --> 00:38:57,546
等等，他们来了
Wait! They're coming.

273
00:39:06,979 --> 00:39:08,556
救命
Help!

274
00:39:10,983 --> 00:39:12,477
Pygar, 就在你右前方
Pygar, right in front of you.

275
00:39:14,862 --> 00:39:17,816
pygar，不，向右
Pygar, no, to the right.

276
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,614
现在
Now!

277
00:39:30,169 --> 00:39:35,792
- 是什么？
- 大暴君的一个黑卫队。
- What is it?
- One of Great Tyrant's Black Guards.

278
00:39:35,966 --> 00:39:41,802
- 那里没人
- 不，黑卫队是皮革人。
- There isn't anybody in there.
- No, Black Guards are leathermen.

279
00:39:41,972 --> 00:39:44,973
他们没有肉质物质。
They're without fleshy substance.

280
00:39:47,478 --> 00:39:50,265
Pygar, 你救了我的命
Pygar, you saved my life.

281
00:40:12,294 --> 00:40:13,954
Pygar?
Pygar?

282
00:40:15,422 --> 00:40:18,542
Pygar... Oh, Pygar!
Pygar... Oh, Pygar!

283
00:40:18,717 --> 00:40:20,793
当心
Be careful!

284
00:40:22,346 --> 00:40:24,220
Oh, Pygar!
Oh, Pygar!

285
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:29,801
有趣的疗法
Interesting therapy!

286
00:40:42,491 --> 00:40:46,192
- 我重获了飞的意愿
- 我知道
- I've regained the will to fly.
- I know.

287
00:40:47,329 --> 00:40:51,030
Oh,这.这是上天的安排
Oh, it was... It was just heavenly.

288
00:40:52,167 --> 00:40:55,999
- 你能带我去SOGO吗？
- 但是我看不见
- Can you take me to Sogo?
- But I cannot see.

289
00:40:56,171 --> 00:40:59,754
-  Pygar.我来做你的眼睛
- 我觉得这不太可能
- I will be your eyes, Pygar.
- I do not believe it is possible.

290
00:40:59,925 --> 00:41:03,092
我们会被黑卫队巡逻队击落
We'll be shot down by Black Guard patrols.

291
00:41:03,262 --> 00:41:06,465
不带我的小型导弹投影机，我们不会被击落的。
Not with my mini-missile projector, we won't.

292
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:56,887
- 你还好吧，pygar？
- 是的
- Are you all right, Pygar?
- Yes, thank you.

293
00:42:18,921 --> 00:42:20,296
我不喜欢那个样子
I don't like the looks of that.

294
00:42:41,568 --> 00:42:43,228
向右一点点
A little to the right.

295
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:56,201
Pygar, 当心
Pygar, watch out!

296
00:43:03,799 --> 00:43:05,377
我抓住他了
I got him!

297
00:43:08,929 --> 00:43:10,969
向右
To the right!

298
00:43:40,711 --> 00:43:43,831
向上，pygar，向上
Up, Pygar, up...

299
00:43:57,436 --> 00:43:59,761
我们可以躲在山后面
We can hide behind that mountain.

300
00:44:04,485 --> 00:44:05,943
Pygar!
Pygar!

301
00:44:11,575 --> 00:44:13,069
Pygar!
Pygar!

302
00:44:44,358 --> 00:44:46,730
- 你还好吧？
- 是的
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

303
00:45:15,389 --> 00:45:18,722
真是时候 我的能量盒完全用完了
Just in time. My energy box is completely dead.

304
00:45:18,892 --> 00:45:20,719
我们现在还安全吧？
Are we all right now?

305
00:45:21,979 --> 00:45:25,430
我想是的。打扰一下
I think so. Excuse me.

306
00:45:36,869 --> 00:45:40,238
我们在这儿，它就在我们正右边。
We're there! It's right below us.

307
00:45:40,414 --> 00:45:43,699
因为你的缘故，我们必须回到回到地面
We must land in a back street, for your sake.

308
00:45:43,876 --> 00:45:47,327
如果在SOGO被发现与一个天使在一起是要被诅咒的。
To be seen in Sogo with an angel would be anathema.

309
00:45:52,342 --> 00:45:55,012
pygar，低头
Pygar, keep your head down.

310
00:46:25,876 --> 00:46:31,712
我们必须找些东西把你的翅膀遮住
Oh my, we must find something to hide your wings.

311
00:46:52,236 --> 00:46:54,145
等等，芭芭丽娜
Wait, Barbarella!

312
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:05,331
- Pygar.别怕
- 我感觉到了危险，保护好你自己
- Don't be afraid, Pygar.
- I sense danger. Guard yourself.

313
00:47:07,835 --> 00:47:11,453
什么也没有 我确定，来
There's nothing. I promise you. Come!

314
00:47:36,989 --> 00:47:38,946
芭芭丽娜
Barbarella!

315
00:47:39,116 --> 00:47:41,239
pygar，等等我
Pygar, wait for me!

316
00:47:43,287 --> 00:47:45,575
你要我做什么？
What do you want of me?

317
00:47:48,042 --> 00:47:49,417
哦
Oh!

318
00:47:58,552 --> 00:48:01,588
喂，美人，美人
Hello, pretty-pretty.

319
00:48:03,682 --> 00:48:05,057
.喂
Hello.

320
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:11,439
非常感谢你
Thank you very much.

321
00:48:11,607 --> 00:48:15,106
你想要过来和我一起玩吗？
Do you want to come and play with me?

322
00:48:15,277 --> 00:48:18,444
对于一些像你这样的人我是收取回报的。
For someone like you I charge nothing.

323
00:48:23,118 --> 00:48:26,155
你太可爱了，小可爱
You're very pretty, pretty-pretty.

324
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:29,331
我的名字不是小可爱 是芭芭丽娜
My name isn't "Pretty-Pretty". It's Barbarella.

325
00:48:45,265 --> 00:48:50,058
- 你在哪里看到一只天使了吗？
- 那个奇怪的鸟？
- Have you seen an angel anywhere?
- The strange bird?

326
00:48:50,229 --> 00:48:51,604
是的
Yes.

327
00:49:01,573 --> 00:49:04,111
是什么在尖叫？
What's that screaming?

328
00:49:04,284 --> 00:49:07,819
很多戏剧性的情况都是开始于尖叫的
A good many dramatic situations begin with screaming.

329
00:49:31,937 --> 00:49:33,479
Pygar!
Pygar!

330
00:49:44,658 --> 00:49:46,033
可怜的pygar
Poor Pygar...

331
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:01,333
振作起来 在你后面有一个房间
Pygar, back up. There's a room behind you.

332
00:50:18,317 --> 00:50:20,642
他们没有跟过来
They're not following.

333
00:50:22,821 --> 00:50:25,526
Pygar,快
Pygar, come.

334
00:50:27,618 --> 00:50:30,025
告诉我那是什么意思
Tell me what that means.

335
00:50:30,537 --> 00:50:34,915
终极会馆
"Chamber of Ultimate...

336
00:50:38,379 --> 00:50:40,252
...解决方案
...Solution".

337
00:50:40,422 --> 00:50:42,379
我不喜欢那样的声音
I don't like the sound of that.

338
00:50:48,347 --> 00:50:50,589
我们最好离开这里
We'd better get out of here.

339
00:50:53,811 --> 00:50:56,681
这里欢迎那些选择死亡的人
Ye who have chosen to die, be welcome.

340
00:50:56,855 --> 00:51:02,609
要想终止生活的痛苦，你要从三个令人激动
To terminate the bitterness of Ilfe, you may select from three exciting...

341
00:51:02,778 --> 00:51:05,613
并且令人惊讶的死亡方式中选择
...and surprising forms of death.

342
00:51:05,781 --> 00:51:10,490
在你面前的每一扇门后面都有一个死亡方式
One of each awaits behind the doors you see before you.

343
00:51:10,661 --> 00:51:16,082
如果你选择失败，你就会被送给mathmos （mathmos应该是个怪兽的名字），没有申诉
If you fail to choose, you'll be given to the Mathmos. There is no appeal.

344
00:51:17,751 --> 00:51:19,827
下一个解决方案
Next solution.

345
00:51:47,114 --> 00:51:49,652
下一个解决方案
Next solution.

346
00:51:49,825 --> 00:51:51,864
我们最好冒险尝试一下
We'd better take the chance.

347
00:52:07,009 --> 00:52:09,001
等等
Wait!

348
00:52:18,854 --> 00:52:21,606
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

349
00:52:22,816 --> 00:52:25,058
你最好跟我一起来
You must come with me.

350
00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:31,150
你叫什么名字？ 你是做什么的？
What is your name? What do you do in life?

351
00:52:31,325 --> 00:52:34,160
我是大暴君的礼宾
I'm Concierge to the Great Tyrant.

352
00:52:34,328 --> 00:52:38,278
- 你对于时机的把握很好，祝贺你
- 不是我
- I congratulate you on your timing.
- That wasn't me.

353
00:52:38,457 --> 00:52:42,585
- 那是被大暴君祝贺的 -我明白了
- That was ordained by the Great Tyrant.
- I see.

354
00:52:42,753 --> 00:52:46,252
地板下面的恐怕东西是什么？
What is that horrible thing under the floor?

355
00:52:48,717 --> 00:52:52,667
- 是我的孩子，mathmos
- mathmos？
- That is the Mathmos, my child.
- The Mathmos?

356
00:52:52,846 --> 00:52:56,465
你真的是从地球来的 你不明白
You really are from Earth. You don't understand.

357
00:52:56,642 --> 00:52:59,975
- 恩，不明白
- The Mathmos...
- No.
- The Mathmos...

358
00:53:00,145 --> 00:53:03,977
整个城市是建在一个湖上的
The whole city is built over a lake.

359
00:53:04,149 --> 00:53:08,942
一个非常奇怪的湖。 跟你的成分很像，我生活的能量来源
A very curious lake. Composed like you and I of living energy...

360
00:53:09,113 --> 00:53:11,686
而且一种液态形式的能量
...but energy in liquid form.

361
00:53:11,865 --> 00:53:14,191
它在看我们
And it watches us.

362
00:53:16,036 --> 00:53:23,166
这是磁场，目前正处于正电荷， 它助长了负电荷的震动。
It is magnetic. Being positively charged, it feeds on negative psychic vibrations.

363
00:53:23,335 --> 00:53:25,826
什么是你所谓的“邪恶”
What you would call "evil".

364
00:53:26,004 --> 00:53:32,374
它助长邪恶的思想，行为和躯体。
It thrives on evil thoughts, deeds and flesh.

365
00:53:32,553 --> 00:53:35,838
反过来，它给我们温暖，光明和它自己的生命
In return, it gives us warmth, light and life itself.

366
00:53:36,014 --> 00:53:39,798
但是它有一个可怕的胃口
But it has a terrible appetite.

367
00:53:40,602 --> 00:53:43,603
也许下次我会看到一些
Perhaps you'll see some other time.

368
00:53:44,648 --> 00:53:46,356
Pygar! Pygar!
Pygar! Pygar!

369
00:53:46,525 --> 00:53:50,190
别担心 你很快就能见到他的
Don't be concerned. You'll see him again soon.

370
00:53:50,362 --> 00:53:53,233
现在，如果你想，请这边走
Now, if you'll just come this way.

371
00:53:54,283 --> 00:53:59,324
坐在这儿 恐怕你得按照我说的做
Here, sit. I'm afraid you must do as I say.

372
00:54:02,332 --> 00:54:04,290
坐在那儿
There, sit.

373
00:54:05,335 --> 00:54:08,455
请向前一点
Forward... Please.

374
00:54:17,139 --> 00:54:18,966
- Oh, Moxys...moxys（人名）
- 什么？
- Oh, Moxys...
- What?

375
00:54:19,141 --> 00:54:22,474
moxys，看，地球生物
Look, Moxys. The earthling.

376
00:54:22,644 --> 00:54:25,135
你得到了她
You get her. Get her now.

377
00:54:25,314 --> 00:54:30,474
礼宾不会让我们玩的。他总是扫我们的兴。不管怎么样我们还是试一试。
The Concierge will never let us. He always spoils our fun. Let's try anyway.

378
00:54:50,089 --> 00:54:52,710
- 地球生物，跟我们一起玩
- 你必须跟我们一起玩
- Play with us, earthling.
- You must play with us.

379
00:54:52,883 --> 00:54:56,584
- 我们有很多洋娃娃
- 我的天啊，你们在这里做什么？
- We have lots of dolls.
- My God, what are they doing here?

380
00:54:56,762 --> 00:55:00,297
Stomoxys（人名）和 Glossina（人名）是大暴君的侄女
Stomoxys and Glossina are nieces of the Great Tyrant.

381
00:55:00,474 --> 00:55:02,716
在我们这里她们非常受欢迎
They're highly favored in our court.

382
00:55:02,893 --> 00:55:05,349
- 为什么不跟我们一起？
- 那不公平
- Why not with us?
- That's not fair.

383
00:55:05,521 --> 00:55:08,724
- 孩子们，大暴君优先
- 我们先看到她的
- The Great Tyrant goes first, children.
- We saw her first.

384
00:55:08,899 --> 00:55:13,111
- 听话，姑娘们
- 站在我旁边
- Be good, girls.
- Stomoxys, Glossina... stay by me.

385
00:55:32,339 --> 00:55:35,257
我的小可爱，我们又见面了
So, my pretty-pretty, we meet again.

386
00:55:56,947 --> 00:56:00,446
你 ！ wench我觉得应该是witch（女巫）单眼睛小女巫
You...! The little one-eyed wench.

387
00:56:00,617 --> 00:56:03,571
你记性很好，小可爱
You have a good memory, Pretty-Pretty.

388
00:56:03,746 --> 00:56:08,407
有时候我想回到我的人民中去，就像他们
Sometimes I like to go among my people... be like them.

389
00:56:08,584 --> 00:56:12,795
普通的，邪恶的，就像你叫的那样
Ordinary. Evil, as you call it.

390
00:56:15,007 --> 00:56:19,087
所以，我是你的单眼睛小情人
So, I'm your little one-eyed wench.

391
00:56:19,261 --> 00:56:22,926
我也是大暴君
I'm also the Great Tyrant.

392
00:56:23,098 --> 00:56:27,594
- 很好
- 它是我乐趣无穷
- Well, that's nice.
- It amuses me immensely.

393
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:32,432
现在，你想要某个人的特权信息，对吧？
Now, you want some privileged information about a certain man, yes?

394
00:56:32,608 --> 00:56:38,148
是的，我在这里是奉地球总统的命令。
Yes, I'm here on the orders of the President of the Republic of Earth.

395
00:56:38,322 --> 00:56:43,743
- 来这里找杜兰杜兰
- 我不是指他，是天使
- I'm here to find Duran Duran.
- I don't mean him, but the angel!

396
00:56:43,911 --> 00:56:47,695
- Pygar?pygar？
- 是的，pygar
- Pygar?
- Yes, Pygar.

397
00:56:47,873 --> 00:56:52,784
他逃离了迷宫，罪恶阿
He has escaped the labyrinth. Crime!

398
00:56:52,961 --> 00:56:58,418
他摧毁了我黑卫队的12名成员 罪恶
He's destroyed 12 of my Black Guards. Crime!

399
00:56:58,592 --> 00:57:04,677
他竟然敢剥夺整个SOGO城的快乐
And he dares to deprive me of a pleasure unique in Sogo...

400
00:57:04,848 --> 00:57:08,134
...一个地球生物，罪恶，罪恶
...An earthling. Crime! Crime!

401
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:13,268
- pygar在那儿？
- 你想要找到你羽毛漂亮的朋友？
- Where is Pygar?
- You want your fine-feathered friend?

402
00:57:14,358 --> 00:57:15,733
他在那儿
There he is.

403
00:57:26,537 --> 00:57:28,031
Pygar!pygar
Pygar!

404
00:57:36,922 --> 00:57:43,969
有趣，不是吗？ 小可爱？ 难道你不喜欢玩？
Amusing, isn't it, Pretty-Pretty? Don't you feel like playing?

405
00:57:44,138 --> 00:57:46,925
小可爱 如果你想你可以跟我们一起玩
Pretty-Pretty... You can play with us if you want.

406
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:52,805
- 好的，为什么不呢？
- 好的，小可爱
- Yes, why not!
- Good, Pretty-Pretty.

407
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:56,930
Mathmos对你产生影响了
The Mathmos is having its effect on you already.

408
00:57:59,611 --> 00:58:04,439
这是烟雾 他们会让一个人有想玩的念头
It's the fumes. They make one want to play.

409
00:58:09,788 --> 00:58:11,532
- 摧毁这个天使
- 什么？
- Decrucify the angel!
- What?

410
00:58:11,707 --> 00:58:14,743
摧毁他，不然我就溶化掉你的脸
Decrucify him or I'll melt your face!

411
00:58:24,636 --> 00:58:28,219
我的脸 我漂亮的脸蛋
My face! My beautiful face...

412
00:58:28,932 --> 00:58:32,052
- 住手，不然我就射击了
- 住手
- Stop or I'll shoot.
- Stop!

413
00:58:32,227 --> 00:58:34,600
-我的脸
- 我警告你
- My face!
- I warn you.

414
00:58:35,731 --> 00:58:38,981
你怎么敢威胁伤害我的脸
How dare you endanger my face!

415
00:58:40,903 --> 00:58:44,236
陛下，观察她的能量扣
Observe her power buckle, Your Majesty.

416
00:58:45,532 --> 00:58:49,660
能量耗竭了，这个武器就像孩子的玩具一点用都没有了
Depleted. This weapon is as harmless as a child's toy.

417
00:58:52,664 --> 00:58:58,288
所以，这只是一个骗局，是吧？ 你应该保存你的伎俩
So, it was a trick, was it? You should have saved your tricks for...

418
00:58:58,462 --> 00:59:02,958
- 为那些鸟，我的陛下？
- 是的，那些鸟
- For the birds, Your Majesty?
- Yes, the birds.

419
00:59:03,133 --> 00:59:06,087
那些鸟 把它给那些鸟
The birds. Give it to the birds.

420
00:59:07,304 --> 00:59:09,213
你必须
You must...

421
00:59:27,783 --> 00:59:31,401
告诉我，我奇妙的，迷糊的
Tell me, my fancy, fuzzy freak.

422
00:59:31,578 --> 00:59:34,828
当你和芭芭丽娜做爱的时候你会想什么？
What do you think of when you make love to Barbarella?

423
00:59:34,998 --> 00:59:38,617
做爱？我不明白
Make love? I do not understand.

424
00:59:38,794 --> 00:59:42,922
别在我面前害羞，你现在没有立场可言。
Don't be coy with me. You are in no position.

425
00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:46,755
如果你只有一只眼睛，你就会看到我是一个多么快乐的人
If only you had one eye, you would see what a delight I am.

426
00:59:46,927 --> 00:59:49,679
我的脸，我的身体
My face, my body.

427
00:59:49,847 --> 00:59:52,801
我所以的东西都是快乐的
All my things are a delight.

428
00:59:53,726 --> 00:59:56,513
讲究的快乐
An exquisite delight.

429
00:59:57,688 --> 01:00:01,638
- 你想要什么？
- 我要与你分享我的快乐
- What is it you want?
- I shall share my delights with you.

430
01:00:01,817 --> 01:00:04,438
你要和我做爱
You shall make love to me.

431
01:00:06,447 --> 01:00:10,029
一个天使不做爱 天使就是爱
An angel doesn't make love. An angel is love.

432
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,323
那你就是一个死鸭子了
Then you're a dead duck.

433
01:00:12,494 --> 01:00:13,870
卫队
Guards!

434
01:00:15,914 --> 01:00:18,750
把这个带翅膀的水果蛋糕给Mathmos
To the Mathmos with this winged fruitcake.

435
01:00:32,097 --> 01:00:36,177
走吧，。。进来
Come along... Get inside.

436
01:00:54,119 --> 01:00:58,247
哦，我亲爱的，我。。
Oh, how darling. Oh, my...

437
01:01:20,354 --> 01:01:22,643
救命
Help!

438
01:01:25,859 --> 01:01:27,318
救命
Help!

439
01:01:31,865 --> 01:01:34,154
这实在是太富有诗意的死亡方式
This is really much too poetic a way to die.

440
01:02:00,018 --> 01:02:04,265
- 密码，快
- 我不明白
- Password, quickly.
- I don't understand.

441
01:02:06,984 --> 01:02:10,400
- 你是一个政治犯吗？
- 我不这样认为
- You're a political prisoner?
- I don't think so.

442
01:02:11,321 --> 01:02:14,987
- 你不是我们中的一个？
- 我来自地球
- Are you not one of us?
- I'm from Earth.

443
01:02:15,159 --> 01:02:20,948
地球？革命的星球 你要加入我们的事业吗？
Earth...? Planet of the Revolutions. Will you join our cause?

444
01:02:21,123 --> 01:02:23,792
什么事业？你是谁？
What cause? Who are you?

445
01:02:25,002 --> 01:02:30,423
我是Dildano，革命部队的首领，这是我们的总部
I'm Dildano, head of the Revolutionary Forces. This is our headquarters.

446
01:02:34,678 --> 01:02:36,303
- 革命万岁
- 大革命
- Long live the Revolution!
- The Revolution!

447
01:02:36,472 --> 01:02:37,966
巡逻部队报告
Patrol report.

448
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:48,476
立即开始第二个层次的。。。。 不，采取秘密通道
Second level immediately... No, take the secret passage.

449
01:03:05,209 --> 01:03:06,786
那扇门
The door!

450
01:03:15,761 --> 01:03:17,919
你是典型的地球女人吗？
Are you typical of earth women?

451
01:03:20,265 --> 01:03:21,641
我是一般的，并不是典型
I'm about average.

452
01:03:23,352 --> 01:03:28,061
- 我是怎么从那个鸟笼里出来的？
- 通过一个秘密的斜道。
- How did I get out of the bird cage?
- Through a secret escape chute.

453
01:03:28,232 --> 01:03:34,068
我们已经在全城建立了秘密通道
We've established secret escape chutes throughout the city.

454
01:03:40,744 --> 01:03:43,615
为了保护我们的组织。
It's for the protection of our group.

455
01:03:47,543 --> 01:03:52,584
- 我知道你救了我的命
- 没有事业的生活是没有效果的。
- You realize you saved my life.
- A life without cause is without effect.

456
01:03:53,424 --> 01:03:55,630
我相信我的政府会回报你的。
I'm sure my government would repay you.

457
01:03:58,262 --> 01:04:01,595
地球女人，我能告诉你我喜欢什么吗？
Earthwoman, shall I tell you what I would like?

458
01:04:03,851 --> 01:04:06,139
我想我知道
I think I know.

459
01:04:12,901 --> 01:04:19,105
不，不是那样的 就像在地球上，那个药片
No! Not like that. Like on earth... the pill.

460
01:04:19,283 --> 01:04:22,284
- 我有药片
- 但是
- I have the pill!
- But...

461
01:04:27,916 --> 01:04:32,246
我们不能按照你的方式做吗？ 我不想改变你的传统
Couldn't we do it your way? I don't want to change your traditions.

462
01:04:32,421 --> 01:04:34,330
我不是奴隶
I'm not a savage.

463
01:04:41,972 --> 01:04:44,843
- 药片
- 好吧
- The pill.
- Right.

464
01:04:46,894 --> 01:04:49,467
我等这个经历已经等了五年了
Five years I've waited for this experience.

465
01:04:50,355 --> 01:04:51,814
等等
Wait!

466
01:05:52,251 --> 01:05:54,160
革命万岁
Long live the Revolution!

467
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:02,172
我的组织必须。。。。
My group must...

468
01:06:19,945 --> 01:06:21,985
喂！
Hello!

469
01:06:24,199 --> 01:06:25,741
抱歉
Sorry!

470
01:06:32,249 --> 01:06:34,123
我的组织必须有更多。。。
My group must have more...

471
01:07:13,082 --> 01:07:18,158
你从哪里得到的这些药片？ 只要地球人知道这些药片
Where did you get those pills? Only Earth people know of those pills.

472
01:07:24,843 --> 01:07:27,132
你在那里，有什么消息吗？
You there... What news?

473
01:07:27,304 --> 01:07:31,432
在能发动进攻之前我的组织必须有更多的武器
My group must have more weapons before we can launch an attack.

474
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:35,929
- 回到原位，等待命令
- 好的
- Back to position. Await your orders.
- Right.

475
01:07:38,148 --> 01:07:43,487
- 你会接受到命令的
- 革命万岁
- You will receive your orders!
- Long live the Revolution!

476
01:07:43,654 --> 01:07:46,026
那扇门，门
The door... the door... Door!

477
01:07:52,704 --> 01:07:56,536
你必须告诉我，是一个地球人给了你这些药片吗？
You must tell me! Did an earth person give you those pills?

478
01:07:56,709 --> 01:08:01,002
- 一个叫杜兰杜兰的人？ -没错
- A man called Duran Duran?
- That's correct.

479
01:08:01,171 --> 01:08:04,623
- 他在哪里？
- 他来的时候给了我这些药片
- Where is he?
- He gave me the pills when he arrived.

480
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:09,011
从那以后就没见过他了，我觉得他还活这，可能在城堡里
Haven't see him since. I think he's alive... probably in the castle.

481
01:08:09,179 --> 01:08:13,307
- 你有什么东西我可以 。。。。
- 当然，一件秘密制服
- Do you have anything I can...
- Of course, have a secret uniform.

482
01:08:13,475 --> 01:08:14,851
谢谢你
Thank you.

483
01:08:17,438 --> 01:08:20,641
我被我的政府派到这里来找杜兰
I was sent here by my government to find Duran Duran.

484
01:08:20,816 --> 01:08:23,141
你的政府？
Your government...?

485
01:08:23,318 --> 01:08:29,439
那意味这你有一个空间飞行器和武器
That must mean that you have a spacecraft and weapons.

486
01:08:29,616 --> 01:08:33,032
是的，当然，我不喜欢这个红色
Yes, of course... I don't like this red.

487
01:08:33,203 --> 01:08:35,955
你能借你的设备给我们吗？为了我们的事业
Would you lend your equipment to our cause?

488
01:08:36,123 --> 01:08:40,915
不，我不能那样做 除非我能把握自己的任务完成。
No, I couldn't do that. Not till I've completed my own mission.

489
01:08:48,427 --> 01:08:53,385
- 也许我们能做笔交易
- 怎么讲？
- Perhaps we can strike a bargain.
- What do you mean?

490
01:08:54,683 --> 01:08:57,933
只有黑皇后知道杜兰杜兰在哪里
Only the Black Queen knows the whereabouts of Duran Duran.

491
01:08:58,103 --> 01:09:02,730
每当她脆弱的时候她都会在她秘密的梦想会所里。
Her one vulnerable moment is when she's in her secret Chamber of Dreams.

492
01:09:03,901 --> 01:09:06,356
- 梦想会所？
- 是的
- Chamber of Dreams?
- Yes.

493
01:09:06,528 --> 01:09:09,897
她独自住在Mathmos上面的一个房间里
She sleeps alone in a room above the Mathmos...

494
01:09:10,074 --> 01:09:13,988
被一堵能量墙包围着， 只有她有一把秘密的钥匙
...surrounded by a wall of energy, to which she has a secret key.

495
01:09:14,161 --> 01:09:20,531
这个，另外一把钥匙，现在在我这里
There is, however, a second key, which is now in my possession.

496
01:09:20,709 --> 01:09:25,620
我要找到杜兰杜兰 我要捕获黑皇后
You want to find Duran Duran. I want to capture the Black Queen.

497
01:09:25,798 --> 01:09:28,371
你懂了我的意思吗？
You follow my meaning?

498
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:32,963
如果你真的有另外一把钥匙，为什么你一只没用它？
If you really have a second key, why haven't you used it already?

499
01:09:38,018 --> 01:09:40,307
因为我们的力量还不够强大。
Because our forces are not yet strong enough.

500
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:46,482
要捕获黑皇后，我们需要有一次军事政变
To capture the Black Queen, we need to have a military coup.

501
01:09:46,652 --> 01:09:48,941
用你的飞行器和武器我们就能做到
We can do this with your weaponry and spacecraft.

502
01:09:49,113 --> 01:09:53,241
控制住黑皇后，你就能知道在哪里能找到杜兰杜兰了
Get control of the Black Queen and you'll know where to find Duran Duran.

503
01:09:53,409 --> 01:09:55,200
- 好的，我明白了
- 好
- Yes, I see.
- Good.

504
01:09:56,662 --> 01:09:59,616
我需要6个小时准备袭击
I need six hours to ready my attack.

505
01:10:01,166 --> 01:10:05,793
首先，我们需要联系上平教授， 看看阿尔法7号是否已经修好。
First, we need to reach Professor Ping to find out if Alpha 7 has been repaired.

506
01:10:05,963 --> 01:10:09,961
顺利完成 我有一个秘密的无线电发射器。
Easily done. I have a secret radio transmitter.

507
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:27,894
平教授呼叫总部 平教授呼叫总部
Professor Ping to Headquarters... Professor Ping to Headquarters.

508
01:10:28,068 --> 01:10:30,524
- 平教授呼叫总部
- 不
- Professor Ping to Headquar...
- No!

509
01:10:30,696 --> 01:10:34,065
总部呼叫平教授 总部呼叫平教授
Headquarters to Professor Ping... Headquarters to Professor Ping.

510
01:10:34,241 --> 01:10:37,277
- 请进
- 我是平，我能听清你说话
- Come in, please.
- This is Ping. I hear you loud and clear.

511
01:10:37,453 --> 01:10:39,944
- 我有地球生物。。。
- 芭芭丽娜
- I have the earthling...
- Barbarella.

512
01:10:40,122 --> 01:10:44,285
...芭芭丽娜和我在一起，我们能用她的飞行器和武器
...Barbarella with me. We can use her spacecraft and weaponry.

513
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:51,458
- 她的飞行器还能运行吗？
- 是的，飞行器已经能飞了
- Is her spacecraft in working order?
- Yes, the craft is ready for flight now.

514
01:10:53,177 --> 01:10:56,261
- 太棒了
- 不过，还有一点不足
- Excellent!
- There is one danger, however.

515
01:10:56,430 --> 01:11:00,759
黑卫队的人巡逻时发现了飞行器， 并可能回来破坏飞行器。
A Black Guard patroller spotted the craft and may return to destroy it.

516
01:11:00,934 --> 01:11:03,093
谢天谢地
Good heavens!

517
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:07,897
我已经通过编程让飞行器 在迷宫外面的隐蔽地方躲起来了。
I have programmed the craft to go a hidden location outside the labyrinth.

518
01:11:08,067 --> 01:11:12,064
- 你是一个巫师，平
- 飞行器现在起飞了
- You're a wizard, Ping.
- It's taking off even now.

519
01:11:12,237 --> 01:11:16,021
它在那儿，完美的飞行模式
There it goes. Perfect flight pattern.

520
01:11:17,451 --> 01:11:24,118
我们的。。。是1600小时 我们的密码是。。。
Our rendez-vous point is 1600 hours. Our password is...

521
01:11:24,291 --> 01:11:27,956
"Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrn- drobwllllantysiliogogogoch."
"Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrn- drobwllllantysiliogogogoch."

522
01:11:28,128 --> 01:11:29,504
你的意思是秘密是。。
You mean the secret is...

523
01:11:29,671 --> 01:11:32,542
"Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrn- drobwllllantysiliogogogoch."
"Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrn- drobwllllantysiliogogogoch."

524
01:11:32,716 --> 01:11:34,092
正是
Exactly!

525
01:11:36,512 --> 01:11:38,504
- 对吗？
- 对
- Right?
- Right.

526
01:11:40,015 --> 01:11:43,680
总部签署 总部签署
Headquarters signing off. Headquarters signing off.

527
01:11:57,741 --> 01:12:00,778
时机成熟，黑皇后在她的梦想会管。
The time is right. The Queen is in her Chamber of Dreams.

528
01:12:00,953 --> 01:12:04,203
- 钥匙呢？
- 钥匙
- What about the key?
- The key!

529
01:12:10,129 --> 01:12:13,248
- 秘密钥匙在那儿
- 哪儿？
- There is the secret key.
- Where?

530
01:12:14,466 --> 01:12:19,508
是隐形的，只有隐形钥匙能打开隐形的墙
It's invisible. Only an invisible key can open an invisible wall.

531
01:12:25,018 --> 01:12:26,394
哪里？
Where?

532
01:12:30,482 --> 01:12:33,602
Mathmos... 钥匙
My Mathmos... the key!

533
01:12:37,948 --> 01:12:39,407
钥匙
The key...

534
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:44,947
我有
I have it!

535
01:12:54,506 --> 01:12:57,543
我会把它系在你神秘的脖子上
I'll put it around your secret neck.

536
01:13:02,222 --> 01:13:03,717
看不见的
Invisible.

537
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:12,433
现在，这张秘密地图会指引你去第12走廊。
Now, the secret map that will lead you to the 12th corridor.

538
01:13:13,275 --> 01:13:14,935
什么走廊？
What corridor?

539
01:13:19,656 --> 01:13:21,115
好的！
Good!

540
01:13:22,326 --> 01:13:23,701
这边走
This way!

541
01:13:34,046 --> 01:13:38,708
"Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrn- drobwllllantysiliogogogoch."   （是一串密码）
"Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrn- drobwllllantysiliogogogoch."

542
01:13:40,010 --> 01:13:41,754
革命万岁
Long live the Revolution!

543
01:13:47,017 --> 01:13:48,392
.一会儿就好
One moment.

544
01:14:19,508 --> 01:14:22,081
我正好不负责管子的样式。
I'm just not the tube type.

545
01:15:11,018 --> 01:15:15,727
打扰一下，你能告诉我第12走廊怎么走吗？
Excuse me. Could you tell me how to get to the 12th corridor?

546
01:15:27,785 --> 01:15:30,026
我喜欢你
I have a taste for you.

547
01:15:44,218 --> 01:15:47,634
- 那是什么？？
- 人的本质
- What is it?
- Essence of Man.

548
01:15:48,263 --> 01:15:50,303
人的本质？
Essence of Man?

549
01:16:05,948 --> 01:16:08,699
所以，你逃脱了那些鸟
So, you escaped the birds!

550
01:16:09,493 --> 01:16:14,404
刚刚好 到我娱乐的时间了
Just as well. It is my turn for some amusement.

551
01:16:14,581 --> 01:16:16,408
跟我来
Come with me.

552
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:20,118
这边请
This way, please!

553
01:17:07,634 --> 01:17:11,679
- 这是什么东西？
- 你很快就知道了，我亲爱的
- What is this thing?
- You will soon see, my dear.

554
01:17:11,847 --> 01:17:16,224
刽子手和各种各样的年轻女人的奏鸣曲
"Sonata for Executioner and Various Young Women".

555
01:17:20,105 --> 01:17:24,317
这。。。。从某个意识上说很好，不是吗？
It's... sort of nice, isn't it?

556
01:17:24,485 --> 01:17:28,778
是的，开头不错
Yes. It is nice... In the beginning.

557
01:17:35,204 --> 01:17:40,245
等到调子变化 可能也会变化你的调子
Wait until the tune changes. It may change your tune as well.

558
01:17:40,834 --> 01:17:43,871
天啊，你什么意思？
Goodness, what do you mean?

559
01:17:58,143 --> 01:18:02,473
当我们达到高潮 你就会没有痛苦的死去
When we reach the crescendo, you will die... of pleasure.

560
01:18:02,648 --> 01:18:06,432
你的生命会结束的很迅速，但是很美，非常美
Your end will be swift, but sweet... very sweet.

561
01:19:47,044 --> 01:19:50,744
这是什么？我不相信
What is this? I don't believe it.

562
01:19:50,923 --> 01:19:52,465
不可能的
It couldn't be!

563
01:19:53,008 --> 01:19:57,172
可怜的姑娘，你对我的机器做过什么？
Wretched girl... What have you done to my excessive machine?

564
01:19:57,346 --> 01:20:01,046
你已经撤销了它 撤销了我，看，看
You've undone it. You've undone me. Look, look!

565
01:20:01,725 --> 01:20:05,770
能量舱正在变小你把他们捆起来
Energy cables are shrinking. You've turned them into faggots.

566
01:20:05,938 --> 01:20:11,478
你把这些使用过渡的机器烧毁了 你炸掉了所有的燃料
You've burned out the excessive machine. You've blown all its fuses.

567
01:20:11,652 --> 01:20:13,312
我的天啊
My goodness!

568
01:20:13,487 --> 01:20:17,948
你浪费了所有的能源 它无法跟着你了
You've exhausted its power. It couldn't keep up with you.

569
01:20:19,201 --> 01:20:24,575
难以置信，你是什么样的女孩？ 难道你不羞愧吗？
Incredible! What kind of girl are you? Have you no shame?

570
01:20:28,544 --> 01:20:33,538
羞愧，为你感到羞愧 你会为此付出代价的。
Shame! Shame on you! You'll pay for this.

571
01:20:35,134 --> 01:20:40,674
我已经给你准备了一些东西 祝你死的愉快
I've got something for you. You'll wish you had died of pleasure.

572
01:20:40,848 --> 01:20:43,339
现在你应该学习睫毛的智慧。
Now you shall learn the wisdom of the lash.

573
01:20:43,517 --> 01:20:46,138
你对我做的还不够吗？
Haven't you done enough to me?

574
01:20:46,311 --> 01:20:50,808
我会对你做一些超越所有已知哲学的事
I'll do things to you that are beyond all known philosophies.

575
01:20:50,983 --> 01:20:53,556
等我拿到我的设备在做
Wait until I get my devices.

576
01:21:09,752 --> 01:21:11,127
杜兰杜兰？
Duran Duran?

577
01:21:24,391 --> 01:21:28,175
哦，认出我了？
Oh, recognized me?

578
01:21:29,396 --> 01:21:31,104
认出你？
Recognized you?

579
01:21:31,273 --> 01:21:36,860
我从来没有认出你。 我之前以为你只有25岁，发生了什么？
I'd never have recognized you. I thought you were only 25. What happened?

580
01:21:37,029 --> 01:21:41,607
- mathmos发挥了它的作用/功效
-  你现在是30岁了。
- The Mathmos is not without its effect.
- But you've aged 30 years!

581
01:21:41,784 --> 01:21:47,620
Mathmos有它自己的营养方式 作为回报，它教给你真理
The Mathmos has its own means of nourishment. In return, it teaches truth.

582
01:21:47,790 --> 01:21:51,372
杜兰杜兰博士，你能递给我一件衣服吗？
Dr. Duran, could you hand me a garment?

583
01:21:52,294 --> 01:21:57,039
地球的总统派我过来救你
The President of the Republic of Earth sent me here to save you.

584
01:21:57,216 --> 01:22:00,798
- 并且带你回地球
- 地球？ 永远不
- And to return you to Earth.
- Earth planet? Never!

585
01:22:00,969 --> 01:22:04,552
我能告诉你为什么吗？ 因为我知道的太多了
Shall I tell you why? Because I know too much.

586
01:22:04,723 --> 01:22:07,641
在崇光我学到了真理和本质
Here in Sogo I have learned truth and essence.

587
01:22:07,810 --> 01:22:11,642
我说的是尊严，崇高的邪恶。
I speak of the dignity, the nobility of pure Evil.

588
01:22:11,814 --> 01:22:14,387
请把靴子给我
My boots, please.

589
01:22:14,566 --> 01:22:18,944
以人为本，道德，原则 都是垃圾，毫无疑义
Humanism! Morals! Principles...! It's rubbish! Nonsense!

590
01:22:19,113 --> 01:22:21,651
我只说真想和本质。
I speak only of truth and of essence.

591
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:25,952
-Positronic射线在哪儿？
- 他就是
- Where is the Positronic Ray?
- So, that's it.

592
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:28,361
这个是做什么用的？
What does it do?

593
01:22:28,539 --> 01:22:34,707
de-miniminized 到了第4级 所有人和物体都在其路径
All persons and objects within its path are de-miniminized to the 4th level.

594
01:22:34,878 --> 01:22:36,752
- 你的意思是。。。？
- 没错
- You mean...?
- That's right.

595
01:22:36,922 --> 01:22:41,335
不可逆转的取代第四层面。
Replaced in the 4th dimension irretrievably.

596
01:22:41,510 --> 01:22:46,136
- 太可怕了
- 是的，难道不是吗？
- But that's monstrous!
- Yes, it is. Isn't it?

597
01:22:46,306 --> 01:22:48,797
在SOGO你为什么不携带武器？
Why didn't you take power here in Sogo?

598
01:22:48,976 --> 01:22:51,348
黑皇后必须第一个被摧毁
The Black Queen must first be destroyed.

599
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:56,312
正像你所知道的她总是被她的黑卫队包围着。
But as you know, she is always surrounded by her Black Guards.

600
01:22:56,483 --> 01:23:00,896
第一个成功杀死她的人会被立即处死。
Whoever succeeds in killing her will be put immediately to a horrible death.

601
01:23:01,071 --> 01:23:03,313
因此，我要谨慎。
Hence, my prudence.

602
01:23:04,533 --> 01:23:10,156
我发现了这个可怕的想法， 我对别人做了什么别人也会对我这样做 （以牙还牙吧）
I find horrible the idea that one could do to me that which I do to others.

603
01:23:10,330 --> 01:23:14,791
但是我听说黑皇后在睡觉的时候很脆弱
But I was told the Black Queen is vulnerable while she sleeps.

604
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:18,578
是的，在梦想会馆里没有黑卫队
Oh, yes. There are no Black Guards in the Chamber of Dreams.

605
01:23:18,756 --> 01:23:21,543
那是因为会馆没有入口
That's because there's no access to the Chamber.

606
01:23:21,717 --> 01:23:26,462
现在是我享受的时候了 也就是你的死期了
But, now's time for my pleasure... and your death.

607
01:23:27,639 --> 01:23:29,015
等等
Wait!

608
01:23:31,852 --> 01:23:34,888
我知道你是怎么进入梦想会馆的
I know how you can enter the Chamber of Dreams.

609
01:23:35,064 --> 01:23:39,310
- 怎么？说
- 我有钥匙
- How? Speak!
- I have the key.

610
01:23:41,528 --> 01:23:44,613
- 钥匙是什么样子的？
- 是透明的，不可见的
- What does it look like?
- It's invisible.

611
01:23:52,289 --> 01:23:55,041
带我去梦想会馆
Take me to the Chamber of Dreams.

612
01:23:56,085 --> 01:23:58,658
芭芭丽娜，在你后面
After you, Barbarella.

613
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:21,937
向右
To the right, Barbarella...

614
01:24:23,237 --> 01:24:24,861
现在向左
Now, to the left...

615
01:24:26,657 --> 01:24:28,032
停
Stop.

616
01:24:29,535 --> 01:24:31,077
打开它
Open it!

617
01:24:37,209 --> 01:24:41,538
- 这一定就是透明墙
- 是的，钥匙呢？
- This must be the invisible wall.
- Yes. Now, where's the key?

618
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:51,885
- 来吧，别拖了
- 我正在找钥匙孔
- Come on, stop stalling.
- I'm trying to find the keyhole.

619
01:25:12,202 --> 01:25:15,571
你被困住了，你被困在了梦想会馆里
You're trapped. You're trapped in the Chamber of Dreams.

620
01:25:15,748 --> 01:25:18,784
-  Mathmos会吃了你
-  我的陛下
- The Mathmos will devour you.
- Your Majesty!

621
01:25:18,959 --> 01:25:24,962
没用的，我有两把钥匙。 这堵墙是被永久密封的。
It's no use. I've got the two keys. The wall's sealed for all eternity.

622
01:25:25,132 --> 01:25:27,919
杜兰杜兰博士，别犯傻了
Dr. Duran, give up this madness!

623
01:25:28,093 --> 01:25:34,630
- 跟我回地球
- 除非作为地球的征服者我才回去
- Return to Earth with me now.
- I'll return to Earth, but as its conqueror!

624
01:25:34,808 --> 01:25:40,395
多亏你，黑皇后，我最后的障碍，已经被清除掉了。
Thanks to you, the Queen, my last obstacle, has been removed.

625
01:25:40,564 --> 01:25:42,936
谢谢你，芭芭丽娜 现在什么也阻止不了我 今天，SOGO城的主人
Thank you, Barbarella.

626
01:25:45,819 --> 01:25:50,446
Nothing can stop me now. Today, Master of Sogo...

627
01:25:50,616 --> 01:25:57,365
明天，地球的主人，银河系的主人，宇宙的主人
Tomorrow, Master of the Earth, Master of the Galaxy, Master of the Universe!

628
01:26:16,225 --> 01:26:22,393
告诉我，我的好的，带羽毛的朋友，你觉得怎么样？
Tell me, my fine, feathered friend, what do you think of...

629
01:26:22,564 --> 01:26:25,316
你什么时候和芭芭丽娜做爱？
...when you make love to Barbarella?

630
01:26:26,819 --> 01:26:31,315
一个天使不做爱的 天使就是爱的象征。
An angel doesn't make love. An angel is love.

631
01:27:45,647 --> 01:27:49,479
醒醒，我的陛下 你必须起来
Wake up, Your Majesty! You must wake up.

632
01:27:51,820 --> 01:27:56,529
Vade retro（不知道啥意思）地球女孩 我知道你并不是真的存在
Vade retro, Earthgirl! I know you don't really exist.

633
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:59,452
可能是，我的陛下 但是我们最好坚持我们看到的。 （意思是她是真实存在的）
That may be, Your Majesty. But we'd better stick to what we see.

634
01:28:01,538 --> 01:28:06,414
可怜的姑娘，你都做了什么？ 我睡觉的时候没人能进来
Wretched girl, what have you done? No one must enter while I sleep.

635
01:28:06,585 --> 01:28:09,871
你的礼宾正在接管王位。
Your Concierge is taking over the throne.

据说除非我一个人在梦想会馆
It is said that unless I am alone in my Chamber of Dreams...

641

不幸的是，这个屏幕是单向的， 我能看到所有的城市和迷宫，但是别人看不到我。
Unfortunately, it's a one-way screen.

644

他们有地球上的武器
They have Earth weapons!

653
01:30:15,172 --> 01:30:21,045
傻瓜，骗子，蠢才 每件事都要我自己做吗？
Fool! Liar! Idiots! Must I do everything myself?

654
01:30:22,679 --> 01:30:27,009
- 我必须消灭这群乌合之众
- 他会使用Positronic射线
- I must destroy this rabble.

它起作用了
It works!

656
01:31:10,477 --> 01:31:12,968

所有都失去了
All is lost.

658
01:31:36,420 --> 01:31:42,672
我必须死，非常好但是我是笑到最后的那一个。
I must die, very well, but it is I who shall have the last laugh.

659
01:31:42,843 --> 01:31:46,426
低能儿不知道大暴君的秘密。
The imbecile doesn't know the secret of the Great Tyrant.

660

- Where are we?
- In the Mathmos. And alive!

664
01:32:38,190 --> 01:32:39,815
我能看到，为什么？
I can see that, but why?

665
01:32:39,983 --> 01:32:45,737
Mathmos制造了这个气泡来保护它自己
The Mathmos created this bubble to protect itself from your innocence.

666
01:32:45,906 --> 01:32:47,281
太好了
That's nice.

667
01:32:54,623 --> 01:32:57,659
不，不，住手，我命令它

你对pygar做了什么？
Pygar! What did you do to Pygar?

675

他被送到了Mathmos，但是他不想你更容易被消化

我有一个更好的主意
