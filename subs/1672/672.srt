1
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,961
and I'll tell you what, the
storm system's still moving west.

2
00:00:40,072 --> 00:00:43,064
What are you looking at, Caroline?

3
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:45,667
The wind, Mom.

4
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:51,181
They say the hurricane is coming.

5
00:00:52,851 --> 00:00:56,014
I'm on a boat.

6
00:00:56,121 --> 00:00:58,385
I'm drifting.

7
00:01:00,726 --> 00:01:03,024
Can I do anything for you, Mom?

8
00:01:04,396 --> 00:01:06,261
Make anything easier?

9
00:01:07,232 --> 00:01:08,631
Oh, sugar...

10
00:01:09,168 --> 00:01:11,432
There's nothing left to do.

11
00:01:11,937 --> 00:01:13,529
Is what it is.

12
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,009
Finding it harder to keep my eyes open.

13
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:23,106
My mouth's full of cotton.

14
00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:25,776
There, there, Miss Daisy.

15
00:01:25,884 --> 00:01:28,614
You gonna scratch yourself to ribbons.

16
00:01:33,525 --> 00:01:36,323
Do you want any more medication, Mother?

17
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:40,426
Doctor said you could have as much as you want.

18
00:01:40,532 --> 00:01:42,796
No need for anybody to suffer.

19
00:01:57,783 --> 00:02:00,684
A friend told me that she never had the chance

20
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:03,084
to say goodbye to her mother.

21
00:02:06,225 --> 00:02:08,557
- I wanted to...
- It's okay.

22
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,187
I wanted to tell you how much I'm gonna miss you so...

23
00:02:12,664 --> 00:02:13,756
Mom.

24
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:17,530
Oh, Caroline.

25
00:02:23,342 --> 00:02:24,832
Are you afraid?

26
00:02:24,943 --> 00:02:26,638
I'm curious.

27
00:02:28,413 --> 00:02:30,040
What comes next?

28
00:02:35,587 --> 00:02:40,354
They built the train station in 1918.

29
00:02:41,393 --> 00:02:44,123
My father was there the day it opened.

30
00:02:45,797 --> 00:02:48,493
He said they had

31
00:02:50,435 --> 00:02:51,732
a tuba band playing.

32
00:02:56,508 --> 00:03:00,569
They had the finest clockmaker in all of the South

33
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,978
to build that glorious clock.

34
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:07,409
His name was...

35
00:03:09,321 --> 00:03:11,118
Mr. Gateau.

36
00:03:15,494 --> 00:03:16,654
Mr. Cake.

37
00:03:19,231 --> 00:03:23,395
He was married to a Creole of Evangeline Parish

38
00:03:23,502 --> 00:03:25,732
and they had a son.

39
00:03:27,673 --> 00:03:32,770
Mr. Gateau was, from birth, absolutely blind.

40
00:03:35,047 --> 00:03:39,279
When their son was old enough, he joined the army.

41
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:44,588
And they prayed God would keep him out of harm's way.

42
00:03:47,526 --> 00:03:52,259
For months, he did nothing but work on that clock.

43
00:03:56,335 --> 00:03:57,768
One day,

44
00:03:59,137 --> 00:04:01,037
a letter came.

45
00:04:06,278 --> 00:04:10,009
And Mr. Gateau, done for the night,

46
00:04:10,716 --> 00:04:13,207
went up, alone, to bed.

47
00:04:15,887 --> 00:04:18,685
And their son came home.

48
00:04:23,862 --> 00:04:26,660
They buried him in the family plot,

49
00:04:26,765 --> 00:04:30,667
where he would be with them when their time came.

50
00:04:32,671 --> 00:04:35,765
Mr. Cake worked on his clock,

51
00:04:38,644 --> 00:04:42,239
laboring to finish.

52
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:47,482
It was a morning to remember.

53
00:04:48,787 --> 00:04:51,915
Papa said there were people everywhere.

54
00:04:53,358 --> 00:04:55,918
Even Teddy Roosevelt came.

55
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:15,544
It's running backwards!

56
00:05:17,182 --> 00:05:18,911
I made it that way

57
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,384
so that perhaps the boys that we lost in the war

58
00:05:22,487 --> 00:05:23,852
might stand and come home again.

59
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,193
Home to farm,

60
00:05:31,296 --> 00:05:32,490
work,

61
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:35,761
have children.

62
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:41,539
To live long, full lives.

63
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,406
Perhaps my own son might come home again.

64
00:05:56,088 --> 00:05:58,613
I'm sorry if I've offended anybody.

65
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:02,456
I hope you enjoy my clock.

66
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:07,230
Mr. Cake was never seen again.

67
00:06:11,603 --> 00:06:16,006
Some say he died of a broken heart.

68
00:06:17,776 --> 00:06:20,040
Some say he went to sea.

69
00:06:25,183 --> 00:06:26,343
Excuse me.

70
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:29,011
Do you mind if I make a call?
Somebody's watching my little boy.

71
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:30,349
Sure.

72
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:42,829
I hope I haven't disappointed you.

73
00:06:42,934 --> 00:06:46,028
You couldn't disappoint me.

74
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:52,375
Well, I know I don't have much to show for myself.

75
00:06:54,946 --> 00:06:57,380
Find my dark suitcase.

76
00:07:01,753 --> 00:07:04,654
There's a diary.

77
00:07:06,825 --> 00:07:07,883
This?

78
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:13,530
Could you read it to me?

79
00:07:14,032 --> 00:07:16,330
Is this what you want to do?

80
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:20,337
I tried to read it a hundred different times.

81
00:07:21,306 --> 00:07:23,297
Mom, it's not exactly...

82
00:07:23,408 --> 00:07:26,809
It's just the sound of your voice, darling.

83
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:28,640
Okay.

84
00:07:31,783 --> 00:07:34,752
It's dated April 4th, 1985.

85
00:07:35,887 --> 00:07:38,219
And it says New Orleans.

86
00:07:38,323 --> 00:07:41,053
"This is my last will and testament.

87
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:45,357
"I don't have much to leave, few
possessions, no money, really.

88
00:07:45,764 --> 00:07:50,997
"I will go out of this world the same
way I came in, alone and with nothing.

89
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,505
"All I have is my story,

90
00:07:53,638 --> 00:07:57,039
"and I'm writing it now while I still remember it.

91
00:07:57,843 --> 00:08:01,006
"My name is Benjamin. Benjamin Button."

92
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:04,473
And I was born under unusual circumstances.

93
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,680
The First World War had ended,

94
00:08:08,386 --> 00:08:12,254
and I've been told it was an
especially good night to be born.

95
00:08:13,892 --> 00:08:16,053
Thank God it's over!

96
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:17,958
We won the war!

97
00:08:32,878 --> 00:08:34,675
The Great War is over!

98
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:47,982
What are you doing here?

99
00:08:48,093 --> 00:08:49,390
Thomas,

100
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:52,062
I'm afraid she's going to die.

101
00:08:52,163 --> 00:08:53,323
What?

102
00:08:54,499 --> 00:08:58,128
That's enough. All of you, get away from her.

103
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:04,433
I came as quickly as I could. The
streets are filled with people.

104
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:05,805
Thomas.

105
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:08,905
Promise me he has a place.

106
00:09:11,316 --> 00:09:12,442
Yeah.

107
00:09:13,818 --> 00:09:15,809
She gave her life for me.

108
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:19,824
And for that, I am forever grateful.

109
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:30,833
Mr. Button.

110
00:09:46,151 --> 00:09:47,379
Thomas!

111
00:09:47,485 --> 00:09:48,713
Thomas.

112
00:09:50,722 --> 00:09:52,883
Thomas? Where are you going?

113
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,851
Hey! What are you doing there?

114
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:27,115
What do you have there?

115
00:11:24,783 --> 00:11:27,115
- Come on, Queenie.
- Now, Mr. Weathers!

116
00:11:27,218 --> 00:11:30,585
Come on, now, you know I ain't got
nothing but work to do around here.

117
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:32,953
- Come on. Just take some time.
- Stop all this foolishness.

118
00:11:36,161 --> 00:11:37,924
The air is sweet.

119
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:45,427
You look very handsome tonight, Miss Queenie.

120
00:11:46,771 --> 00:11:48,898
Handsome as I've ever seen.

121
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:52,571
The brown matches your eyes.

122
00:11:52,677 --> 00:11:54,008
Oh, hush!

123
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,610
Let's see here. You ain't no slouch yourself.

124
00:12:08,193 --> 00:12:09,990
Hambert's back in town.

125
00:12:10,095 --> 00:12:13,861
He came home legless, but he's home.

126
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:17,494
I know you were sweet on him one time.

127
00:12:18,036 --> 00:12:19,901
Sweeter than I should have been.

128
00:12:20,004 --> 00:12:21,904
Miss Simone messed herself.

129
00:12:22,006 --> 00:12:23,234
Oh, sweet Jesus.

130
00:12:23,341 --> 00:12:25,866
She got to stop doing that or it's diapers for her.

131
00:12:25,977 --> 00:12:28,002
- I'll be right there, Miss Jameson!
- Now, Queenie, now come on.

132
00:12:28,113 --> 00:12:30,673
Okay, Queenie'll be right there.

133
00:12:30,782 --> 00:12:32,044
It's awful nice out here.

134
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:35,347
Come on out back for a moment.
Take your mind off things.

135
00:12:35,453 --> 00:12:36,477
You're so bad.

136
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:39,056
- What in God's name?
- What's this?

137
00:12:49,434 --> 00:12:51,664
Oh, the Lord done something here.

138
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:55,262
Hope I didn't hurt it none stepping on it like that.

139
00:12:55,373 --> 00:12:56,897
We best leave that for the police.

140
00:12:57,008 --> 00:12:58,498
Poor baby.

141
00:12:59,344 --> 00:13:00,675
I'll go.

142
00:13:01,346 --> 00:13:05,009
It's for sure nobody wanted to keep it. Come on, baby.

143
00:13:07,685 --> 00:13:10,119
Queenie? Where are you, Queenie?

144
00:13:10,221 --> 00:13:12,155
Hold your water! You go deal with it.

145
00:13:12,257 --> 00:13:14,350
Okay. No, go, I'll be back.

146
00:13:15,226 --> 00:13:18,491
Queenie, Apple, she went and
messed herself all over again!

147
00:13:18,596 --> 00:13:20,461
Jane Childress, start her a bath!

148
00:13:20,565 --> 00:13:22,624
And mind your own business, Mrs. Duprey.

149
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:24,531
You'll be messing yourself soon enough.

150
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:26,194
Somebody stole my necklace.

151
00:13:26,304 --> 00:13:29,239
Okay. All right, Mrs. Hollister,
I'll be right with you, okay?

152
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,535
Go on back upstairs, hear?

153
00:13:37,849 --> 00:13:40,374
You are as ugly as an old pot

154
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:42,146
but you're still a child of God.

155
00:13:42,253 --> 00:13:44,619
Queenie, Apple, she won't take a bath without you!

156
00:13:44,722 --> 00:13:46,189
Mercy.

157
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,259
I'll be right there!

158
00:13:51,296 --> 00:13:54,231
Okay. You just wait right here for me now, okay?

159
00:13:57,569 --> 00:14:02,199
My sister gave me those pearls.
I can't find them anywhere.

160
00:14:02,307 --> 00:14:06,141
- Somebody's been stealing my jewelry.
- They're right here, Mrs. Hollister. See?

161
00:14:06,244 --> 00:14:09,543
Right around your pretty white neck.
Now, come on. Hush all that noise.

162
00:14:09,647 --> 00:14:12,241
- Is Dr. Rose still here?
- I don't know.

163
00:14:15,053 --> 00:14:16,350
Your heart is strong.

164
00:14:16,454 --> 00:14:19,423
You just want to avoid any undue stimulation.

165
00:14:20,024 --> 00:14:23,118
I trust you ladies will help me out with that?

166
00:14:23,228 --> 00:14:26,356
I have something. Could you come downstairs?

167
00:14:30,068 --> 00:14:33,765
Never seen anything like it.
Nearly blind from cataracts.

168
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:37,933
I'm not sure if he can hear. His
bones indicate severe arthritis.

169
00:14:38,776 --> 00:14:43,145
His skin has lost all elasticity,
and his hands and feet are ossified.

170
00:14:43,248 --> 00:14:47,844
He shows all the deterioration,
the infirmities, not of a newborn,

171
00:14:47,952 --> 00:14:50,580
but of a man well in his 80s on his way to the grave.

172
00:14:50,688 --> 00:14:51,677
He's dying?

173
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:55,020
His body is failing him before his life's begun.

174
00:14:57,395 --> 00:14:58,828
Where'd he come from?

175
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:03,299
My sister's child. From Lafayette.
She had an unfortunate adventure.

176
00:15:03,401 --> 00:15:07,303
The poor child, he got the worst of it. Come out white.

177
00:15:10,341 --> 00:15:14,937
There are places for unwanted
babies like these, Queenie.

178
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,242
No room for another mouth to feed here.

179
00:15:18,349 --> 00:15:20,874
The Nolan Foundation, despite their good intentions,

180
00:15:20,985 --> 00:15:23,749
thinks this place is a large nuisance as it is.

181
00:15:23,855 --> 00:15:26,014
- A baby...
- You said he don't have long.

182
00:15:26,124 --> 00:15:30,686
Queenie, some creatures aren't meant to survive.

183
00:15:34,098 --> 00:15:37,829
No, this baby, he is a miracle. That's for certain.

184
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:40,928
Just not the kind of miracle one hopes to see.

185
00:15:43,975 --> 00:15:46,466
Y'all listen. Y'all listen up here.

186
00:15:47,245 --> 00:15:48,269
We're gonna have us a visitor

187
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:51,473
that's gonna be staying with us for a little while.

188
00:15:51,582 --> 00:15:55,279
My sister had a child and she
couldn't see right by it, so...

189
00:15:57,555 --> 00:15:59,284
He's known as...

190
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,857
Benjamin.

191
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:05,826
Benjamin.

192
00:16:06,731 --> 00:16:09,666
He's not a well child, so we're
gonna have to take good care of him.

193
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:10,825
I had 10 children.

194
00:16:10,935 --> 00:16:14,268
There's not a baby I can't care for. Let me see him.

195
00:16:16,474 --> 00:16:20,103
God in Heaven. He looks just like my ex-husband.

196
00:16:20,945 --> 00:16:23,573
Look, he's prematurely old.

197
00:16:24,082 --> 00:16:27,609
Dr. Rose said he ain't got
much more time on this earth.

198
00:16:27,952 --> 00:16:29,078
Join the club.

199
00:16:34,192 --> 00:16:35,659
He's smiling!

200
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:45,095
Hambert sends his remembrances to you.

201
00:16:54,912 --> 00:16:57,244
Are you right out of your mind?

202
00:16:58,549 --> 00:17:01,916
I know you ain't got all the parts
it takes to make one of your own,

203
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,248
but this ain't yours to keep.

204
00:17:03,354 --> 00:17:05,618
It may not even be humankind.

205
00:17:14,766 --> 00:17:17,166
Mr. Weathers, come back here.

206
00:17:19,504 --> 00:17:20,732
Please.

207
00:17:37,088 --> 00:17:39,648
You never know what's coming for you.

208
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:52,033
It seemed I had found a home.

209
00:17:55,206 --> 00:17:56,264
Is any of this true?

210
00:17:56,374 --> 00:17:59,741
You have such a lovely voice.

211
00:18:00,311 --> 00:18:04,975
Mom, it's an ancient streetcar token.

212
00:18:06,684 --> 00:18:09,812
That clock just kept going,

213
00:18:10,822 --> 00:18:15,020
year after year after year.

214
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,230
But I didn't know I was a child.

215
00:18:21,332 --> 00:18:23,800
Same old crap every day.

216
00:18:24,702 --> 00:18:27,466
I thought I was like everyone else there.

217
00:18:28,473 --> 00:18:30,634
An old man in the twilight of his life.

218
00:18:30,741 --> 00:18:33,073
Could you make him stop that?

219
00:18:34,078 --> 00:18:37,138
Stop banging that fork. It's used
for eating, not for playing with.

220
00:18:37,248 --> 00:18:40,081
And use your napkin, please, Mr. Benjamin.

221
00:18:42,453 --> 00:18:43,715
Queenie!

222
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,097
Hey, boy.

223
00:19:04,475 --> 00:19:06,773
Always had a healthy curiosity.

224
00:19:07,945 --> 00:19:11,403
What was up the street? Or around the next corner?

225
00:19:13,284 --> 00:19:14,581
Go get him!

226
00:19:14,685 --> 00:19:18,382
Benjamin! That is dangerous. Come back over here.

227
00:19:19,123 --> 00:19:20,852
Stay put, child.

228
00:19:23,227 --> 00:19:25,161
I loved her very much.

229
00:19:25,963 --> 00:19:27,590
She was my mother.

230
00:19:27,698 --> 00:19:28,858
Mama.

231
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:30,693
Mama.

232
00:19:31,502 --> 00:19:35,268
Some days I feel different than the day before.

233
00:19:36,707 --> 00:19:40,734
Everybody feels different about
themselves, one way or another.

234
00:19:41,712 --> 00:19:44,010
But we're all going the same way.

235
00:19:45,383 --> 00:19:49,046
Just taking different roads to get there, that's all.

236
00:19:49,153 --> 00:19:51,621
You're on your own road, Benjamin.

237
00:19:54,392 --> 00:19:57,054
Mama? How much longer I got?

238
00:19:57,562 --> 00:20:00,861
Just be thankful for what you're given, hear?

239
00:20:00,965 --> 00:20:04,025
You're already here longer than you're supposed to.

240
00:20:06,938 --> 00:20:09,839
Some nights, I'd have to sleep alone.

241
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:20,210
I didn't mind.

242
00:20:21,118 --> 00:20:23,848
I would listen to the house breathing.

243
00:20:25,056 --> 00:20:27,115
All those people sleeping.

244
00:20:28,593 --> 00:20:30,788
I felt safe.

245
00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:54,243
It was a place of great routine.

246
00:20:54,352 --> 00:20:57,253
Every morning at 5:30, no matter the weather,

247
00:20:57,355 --> 00:21:01,416
General Winslow, U.S. Army,
Retired, would raise the flag.

248
00:21:04,295 --> 00:21:08,254
Mrs. Sybil Wagner, once an opera singer of some note,

249
00:21:08,366 --> 00:21:10,994
well, she sang Wagner.

250
00:21:22,813 --> 00:21:24,246
All right, baby, come on.

251
00:21:24,348 --> 00:21:28,182
We got to put some life into these old sticks for you.

252
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:32,586
Get you walking so you can help me
out around here. Come on now, hear?

253
00:21:33,691 --> 00:21:37,525
No matter the season, supper
was served promptly at 5:30.

254
00:21:37,628 --> 00:21:39,789
Molasses.

255
00:21:39,897 --> 00:21:41,125
Molasses.

256
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:43,924
Molasses.

257
00:21:44,902 --> 00:21:47,427
I learned to read when I was five.

258
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:51,940
My grandfather was a dresser for a famous actor.

259
00:21:52,043 --> 00:21:54,739
He brung home every play for me to read.

260
00:21:56,981 --> 00:22:00,712
"Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,

261
00:22:01,652 --> 00:22:05,247
"Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.

262
00:22:06,023 --> 00:22:08,753
"Even like a man new haled from the rack,

263
00:22:08,859 --> 00:22:11,555
"So fare my limbs with long imprisonment.

264
00:22:12,296 --> 00:22:15,925
"And these gray locks, the pursuivants of death,

265
00:22:16,567 --> 00:22:19,536
"Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer."

266
00:22:23,441 --> 00:22:26,502
You thought I was plain ignorant, didn't you?

267
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:30,239
The actor my grandfather worked
for was John Wilkes Booth.

268
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,575
He killed Abraham Lincoln.

269
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:38,982
You never know what's coming for you.

270
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:43,285
On Saturday nights, Mama would make me go to church.

271
00:22:47,098 --> 00:22:48,463
Benjamin!

272
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:00,367
- Amen! Amen!
- Amen! Amen!

273
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,312
What can I do for you, sister?

274
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:20,620
Her parts are all twisted up inside
and she can't have little children.

275
00:23:24,435 --> 00:23:28,462
Lord, if you could see clear
to forgive this woman her sins

276
00:23:28,572 --> 00:23:30,665
so she can bear the fruit of the womb.

277
00:23:30,775 --> 00:23:33,175
Out, damnable affliction!

278
00:23:33,277 --> 00:23:35,438
- Praise God!
- Praise God!

279
00:23:35,546 --> 00:23:36,706
Hallelujah!

280
00:23:36,814 --> 00:23:38,281
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

281
00:23:40,351 --> 00:23:43,081
And what's this old man's irrediction?

282
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:46,222
He's got the Devil on his back,

283
00:23:46,323 --> 00:23:49,588
trying to ride him into the grave before his time.

284
00:23:52,897 --> 00:23:54,330
- Out, Zebuchar!
- Yes!

285
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:56,263
- Out, Beelzebub!
- Yes!

286
00:23:58,169 --> 00:23:59,898
How old are you?

287
00:24:00,004 --> 00:24:02,495
Seven. But I look a lot older.

288
00:24:03,574 --> 00:24:05,064
God bless you.

289
00:24:05,676 --> 00:24:07,143
He's seven.

290
00:24:09,947 --> 00:24:13,883
Now, this is a man with optimism in his heart.

291
00:24:13,984 --> 00:24:15,679
- All right.
- Belief in his soul!

292
00:24:15,786 --> 00:24:16,775
- Yes!
- Yes!

293
00:24:16,887 --> 00:24:18,684
We are all children in the eyes of God!

294
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:20,086
- Yes!
- Hallelujah!

295
00:24:20,191 --> 00:24:23,058
We are gonna get you out of that chair.

296
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,185
- And we're gonna have you walk.
- Amen.

297
00:24:26,063 --> 00:24:27,621
It's all right.

298
00:24:28,566 --> 00:24:30,761
In the name of God's glory...

299
00:24:31,635 --> 00:24:33,068
Rise up!

300
00:24:34,572 --> 00:24:35,937
Come on.

301
00:24:37,775 --> 00:24:39,538
Come on. Walk.

302
00:24:39,643 --> 00:24:41,076
Come on, son. Come on.

303
00:24:41,178 --> 00:24:43,908
- Come on with it, son. Come on.
- Come on.

304
00:24:44,014 --> 00:24:47,381
Now God is gonna see you the rest of the way.

305
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:52,286
He's gonna see this little old man walk
without the use of a crutch or a cane.

306
00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:54,186
He's gonna see that you walk from faith...

307
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:57,260
- Hallelujah!
- and divine inspiration alone!

308
00:24:57,361 --> 00:24:58,521
- Yes.
- Hey, Ben!

309
00:24:58,629 --> 00:24:59,926
- Go, son!
- Now walk.

310
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,258
- Yes.
- Come on.

311
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,027
Don't touch him.

312
00:25:07,404 --> 00:25:09,133
Rise up, old man.

313
00:25:10,207 --> 00:25:12,767
Rise up like Lazarus.

314
00:25:12,877 --> 00:25:15,004
I said, rise up!

315
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,044
Hallelujah!

316
00:25:19,216 --> 00:25:20,410
Yes.

317
00:25:20,885 --> 00:25:22,079
Come on.

318
00:25:22,186 --> 00:25:23,175
Say hallelujah.

319
00:25:23,287 --> 00:25:24,652
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

320
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,584
Walk.

321
00:25:28,392 --> 00:25:30,451
Walk on. Yes.

322
00:25:34,331 --> 00:25:35,355
That's right, Benjamin.

323
00:25:35,466 --> 00:25:38,697
Now when I look back on it, it was miraculous.

324
00:25:38,802 --> 00:25:42,829
But you know the saying, the Lord
giveth and the Lord taketh away.

325
00:25:43,107 --> 00:25:44,972
Glory in the highest!

326
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:50,239
Sweet Jesus!

327
00:25:50,381 --> 00:25:51,473
- No!
- No!

328
00:25:53,951 --> 00:25:55,282
There were so many birthdays.

329
00:25:55,386 --> 00:25:58,913
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow...

330
00:25:59,023 --> 00:26:01,617
So we wouldn't run out, we would spare the candles.

331
00:26:01,725 --> 00:26:05,752
Queenie, you know I don't like
birthdays and I don't like cake.

332
00:26:06,463 --> 00:26:10,399
And death was a common visitor. People came and went.

333
00:26:12,236 --> 00:26:14,636
You always knew when someone left us.

334
00:26:14,738 --> 00:26:17,229
There was a silence in the house.

335
00:26:31,322 --> 00:26:33,586
It was a wonderful place to grow up.

336
00:26:33,691 --> 00:26:38,151
I was with people who had shed all
the inconsequences of earlier life.

337
00:26:38,862 --> 00:26:42,958
Left wondering about the weather,
the temperature of a bath,

338
00:26:44,201 --> 00:26:46,396
the light at the end of a day.

339
00:26:50,808 --> 00:26:54,767
For everyone that died, someone
would come to take their place.

340
00:26:55,846 --> 00:26:58,110
I've been married five times.

341
00:26:58,649 --> 00:27:02,346
My fifth wife and I are captured
by a neighbor tribe of cannibals.

342
00:27:02,453 --> 00:27:03,511
Oh, goodness gracious.

343
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:05,088
We escaped across the river.

344
00:27:05,189 --> 00:27:08,556
My wife, she can't swim, so, sadly, she eaten.

345
00:27:08,659 --> 00:27:09,853
Oh, my God.

346
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,793
My second wife steps on cobra and dies.

347
00:27:13,364 --> 00:27:16,128
It was very bad luck to be married to me.

348
00:27:16,233 --> 00:27:19,259
That's Mr. Oti. He's an acquaintance
of an acquaintance of mine.

349
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:21,463
- The next summer I'm captured...
- He's a Pygmy.

350
00:27:21,572 --> 00:27:23,437
with three others by the Baschiele tribe.

351
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:28,409
They trade us for pigs, shoes, and
beer to a very strange American man.

352
00:27:47,531 --> 00:27:50,022
I hear you're not so old as you're looking.

353
00:27:50,134 --> 00:27:52,364
You just fooling everybody.

354
00:27:52,936 --> 00:27:55,962
What's the matter? Did you get Madjembe?

355
00:27:56,073 --> 00:27:57,438
What's Madjembe?

356
00:27:57,541 --> 00:27:58,838
Worms.

357
00:27:59,243 --> 00:28:01,507
I don't think I have worms.

358
00:28:02,179 --> 00:28:03,703
This is just how I am.

359
00:28:03,814 --> 00:28:06,681
- Did you take your pills today?
- No, ma'am.

360
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:09,116
Come. Let's get a cold root beer.

361
00:28:09,219 --> 00:28:11,346
I found the medication under your pillow.

362
00:28:11,455 --> 00:28:14,618
I'm not supposed to. It's dangerous.

363
00:28:14,725 --> 00:28:17,455
Who said that? Come on, little man.

364
00:28:18,762 --> 00:28:20,423
Hello, children.

365
00:28:31,675 --> 00:28:33,165
Hold, please.

366
00:28:35,846 --> 00:28:40,146
Then I'm in the monkey house
at Philadelphia Zoological Park.

367
00:28:41,051 --> 00:28:44,543
Three thousand people show up my first day.

368
00:28:45,889 --> 00:28:46,878
Look.

369
00:28:48,692 --> 00:28:50,592
What's it like living in a cage?

370
00:28:50,694 --> 00:28:52,161
It stinks.

371
00:28:52,796 --> 00:28:55,060
But the monkeys.

372
00:28:55,866 --> 00:28:57,891
They do some tricks there.

373
00:28:58,135 --> 00:29:00,831
I throw a spear, wrestle with Kowali.

374
00:29:01,672 --> 00:29:03,401
She is orangutan.

375
00:29:03,841 --> 00:29:07,368
When I'm not playing with the monkeys,
they want me to run to the bars

376
00:29:07,478 --> 00:29:09,571
in my cage, with my teeth.

377
00:29:19,523 --> 00:29:21,582
So then what'd you do?

378
00:29:21,692 --> 00:29:27,528
Then I leave zoo, go here, go
there. Wandered most of the time.

379
00:29:27,998 --> 00:29:29,022
You were all alone?

380
00:29:29,133 --> 00:29:31,431
Plenty of time you'll be alone.

381
00:29:31,535 --> 00:29:34,971
When you're different like us, it's gonna be that way.

382
00:29:38,008 --> 00:29:39,839
But I'll tell you a little secret.

383
00:29:39,943 --> 00:29:43,242
Fat people, skinny people, tall people,

384
00:29:43,347 --> 00:29:46,339
white people, they're just as alone as we are.

385
00:29:46,884 --> 00:29:49,079
But they're scared shitless.

386
00:29:55,292 --> 00:29:57,920
I think about the river I grew up on.

387
00:29:58,395 --> 00:30:01,296
It would be nice to sit by my river again.

388
00:30:03,567 --> 00:30:05,933
Come, I have an appointment.

389
00:30:08,338 --> 00:30:10,898
There's my little man. You ready, sugar?

390
00:30:11,008 --> 00:30:13,340
Always ready. Always ready.

391
00:30:15,145 --> 00:30:17,238
Filamena, Mr. Benjamin.

392
00:30:18,282 --> 00:30:21,342
- It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
- My pleasure, ma'am.

393
00:30:21,451 --> 00:30:23,419
You can find your own way home, can't you?

394
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,250
Take the St. Charles line to Napoleon.

395
00:30:32,262 --> 00:30:33,854
Hey! Hey!

396
00:30:54,184 --> 00:30:57,676
Where in God's name have you been? Get in here.

397
00:30:59,189 --> 00:31:02,454
I mean, you take my breath away, you know that?

398
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,454
Oh, Lord, I was so worried about you.

399
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:11,726
It had been the best day of my life.

400
00:31:12,669 --> 00:31:15,365
- How's her breathing?
- It's shallow.

401
00:31:15,472 --> 00:31:16,996
They say it'll reach us in a few hours,

402
00:31:17,107 --> 00:31:20,008
so I gotta get my baby and take him to my sister's.

403
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,578
They say there's nothing to
worry about here in the hospital.

404
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:25,170
Nurses'll be right here if you need them. Are you okay?

405
00:31:25,282 --> 00:31:29,013
- Yeah, I'm okay reading.
- I shouldn't be more than an hour.

406
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:33,048
Was there just company?

407
00:31:33,624 --> 00:31:36,024
It was just Dorothy leaving.

408
00:31:38,195 --> 00:31:39,628
Go on, Caroline.

409
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:42,824
"On Sundays, the families would come and visit."

410
00:31:43,233 --> 00:31:46,168
It was Thanksgiving, 1930.

411
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:49,239
I met the person who changed my life forever.

412
00:32:01,318 --> 00:32:03,377
Well, Benjamin.

413
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:07,119
Might I say you are looking strikingly youthful.

414
00:32:07,591 --> 00:32:09,149
Good day, Mrs. Fuller.

415
00:32:09,259 --> 00:32:12,524
A single cane, back straight as an arrow.

416
00:32:12,629 --> 00:32:14,995
What elixir have you been drinking?

417
00:32:15,098 --> 00:32:18,465
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Grandma! Look at me!

418
00:32:20,904 --> 00:32:23,236
That was really something.

419
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,205
Come on over here, you.

420
00:32:25,342 --> 00:32:28,140
Now, this is my granddaughter, Daisy.

421
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:30,910
This is Mr....

422
00:32:31,048 --> 00:32:34,711
I'm afraid, Benjamin, I don't
rightly know your last name.

423
00:32:34,818 --> 00:32:36,445
Benjamin's fine.

424
00:32:37,087 --> 00:32:39,419
I never forgot her blue eyes.

425
00:32:39,856 --> 00:32:42,518
Good people, supper is served.

426
00:32:42,626 --> 00:32:48,724
Health and food, for love and friends.
For everything thy goodness sends.

427
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:50,326
Amen.

428
00:32:50,434 --> 00:32:51,662
- Amen!
- Amen!

429
00:32:55,372 --> 00:32:57,932
Did you know turkeys aren't really birds?

430
00:32:58,041 --> 00:32:59,065
Why do you say that?

431
00:32:59,176 --> 00:33:02,304
They're in the pheasant family, can't hardly fly.

432
00:33:02,412 --> 00:33:04,937
It's sad, don't you think? Birds that can't fly?

433
00:33:05,048 --> 00:33:07,209
I love birds that can't fly.

434
00:33:07,317 --> 00:33:09,308
They are so delicious.

435
00:33:10,487 --> 00:33:12,955
- That's terrible.
- I have something to tell y'all

436
00:33:13,056 --> 00:33:16,219
while we're giving thanks for God's blessings.

437
00:33:16,326 --> 00:33:18,260
I had a miracle happen.

438
00:33:18,762 --> 00:33:21,390
The Lord saw fit to answer my prayers.

439
00:33:25,102 --> 00:33:27,400
What does she mean, answered her prayers?

440
00:33:27,504 --> 00:33:29,028
Thanks. Thank you.

441
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:31,505
She's gonna have a baby, silly.

442
00:33:32,476 --> 00:33:35,468
That's what my mama said when
I was gonna have a baby brother,

443
00:33:35,579 --> 00:33:37,843
but he didn't live long,

444
00:33:39,082 --> 00:33:41,414
'cause he didn't breathe right.

445
00:33:44,287 --> 00:33:48,280
"In the afternoon, when he
had got his beautiful hind legs

446
00:33:48,392 --> 00:33:51,987
"just as Big God Nqong had promised.

447
00:33:52,863 --> 00:33:55,058
"You can see that it is 5:00,

448
00:33:55,165 --> 00:33:59,124
"because Big God Nqong's clock says so."

449
00:33:59,236 --> 00:34:01,067
Isn't that something?

450
00:34:01,638 --> 00:34:03,003
Again, read it again.

451
00:34:03,106 --> 00:34:05,404
Oh, read it again, please.

452
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:08,808
All right. But afterwards, you must go to bed.

453
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,578
I promise.

454
00:34:12,549 --> 00:34:14,380
"Old Man Kangaroo."

455
00:34:18,688 --> 00:34:20,349
Are you sleeping?

456
00:34:21,892 --> 00:34:23,382
Who's that?

457
00:34:23,493 --> 00:34:25,051
It's me, Daisy.

458
00:34:26,096 --> 00:34:27,563
Oh, hi!

459
00:34:28,165 --> 00:34:29,655
'Kay, come on.

460
00:34:40,811 --> 00:34:42,540
Where are we going?

461
00:34:43,713 --> 00:34:46,511
Come on. Under here.

462
00:34:56,059 --> 00:34:57,492
Here, you light it.

463
00:34:57,594 --> 00:34:59,687
I'm not supposed to play with matches.

464
00:34:59,796 --> 00:35:02,060
Don't be a chicken. Light it.

465
00:35:13,176 --> 00:35:16,111
I'll tell you a secret if you'll tell me one.

466
00:35:16,213 --> 00:35:17,646
Okay.

467
00:35:17,747 --> 00:35:21,080
I saw my mama kissing another man.

468
00:35:21,485 --> 00:35:23,544
Her face was red from it.

469
00:35:25,822 --> 00:35:27,312
Your turn.

470
00:35:30,627 --> 00:35:32,925
I'm not as old as I look.

471
00:35:33,029 --> 00:35:34,587
I thought so.

472
00:35:36,566 --> 00:35:39,000
You don't seem like an old person.

473
00:35:39,669 --> 00:35:41,830
- Like my grandma.
- I'm not.

474
00:35:43,607 --> 00:35:45,199
Are you sick?

475
00:35:45,775 --> 00:35:48,938
Well, I heard Mama and Tizzy whispering.

476
00:35:49,045 --> 00:35:53,209
They said I was gonna die soon, but maybe not.

477
00:35:55,452 --> 00:35:56,976
You're odd.

478
00:35:57,754 --> 00:36:00,621
You're different than anybody I've ever met.

479
00:36:03,793 --> 00:36:05,954
- May I?
- Okay.

480
00:36:13,203 --> 00:36:15,637
What are you doing under there?

481
00:36:15,739 --> 00:36:19,175
You come right out here and get back up to bed!

482
00:36:19,276 --> 00:36:21,039
It's after midnight!

483
00:36:21,144 --> 00:36:23,237
You are not to be playing together.

484
00:36:23,346 --> 00:36:24,870
Yes, ma'am.

485
00:36:24,981 --> 00:36:27,142
Now you get back to bed, little lady.

486
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:31,209
You're too young to be wandering
around in the night on your own.

487
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:37,724
And you ought to be ashamed of yourself.

488
00:36:53,009 --> 00:36:55,068
You are a different child.

489
00:36:55,845 --> 00:36:56,937
A man-child.

490
00:36:57,047 --> 00:37:01,507
And, baby, people aren't gonna
understand just how different you are.

491
00:37:07,824 --> 00:37:09,985
What's wrong with me, Mama?

492
00:37:10,927 --> 00:37:12,690
Come here.

493
00:37:14,864 --> 00:37:17,094
God hasn't said yet, baby.

494
00:37:21,538 --> 00:37:25,030
Now go on to bed, hear? And behave yourself.

495
00:37:26,376 --> 00:37:28,936
Go on. Say your prayers, hear?

496
00:37:40,757 --> 00:37:44,818
Did I ever tell you I've been
struck by lightning seven times?

497
00:37:47,163 --> 00:37:50,064
Once when I was repairing a leak on the roof.

498
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:57,401
Once I was just crossing the road to get the mail.

499
00:38:13,456 --> 00:38:14,753
I never forgot her...

500
00:38:14,858 --> 00:38:16,348
"blue eyes."

501
00:38:17,827 --> 00:38:19,385
Mom?

502
00:38:19,496 --> 00:38:24,263
Did you get that this Benjamin loved
you from the first time that he saw you?

503
00:38:25,535 --> 00:38:27,969
Not many people experience that.

504
00:38:29,472 --> 00:38:31,235
Want me to go on?

505
00:38:33,243 --> 00:38:35,234
He crosses something out.

506
00:38:35,345 --> 00:38:38,644
When that baby came, things were different.

507
00:38:38,748 --> 00:38:42,081
Your mama gone away And your daddy gonna stay

508
00:38:42,185 --> 00:38:45,985
Didn't leave nobody but the baby

509
00:38:47,457 --> 00:38:50,051
Babies were born, people died.

510
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,793
A lot of folks been through that old house.

511
00:38:55,765 --> 00:38:58,996
I've come to say goodbye. I'm going away.

512
00:38:59,102 --> 00:39:00,364
Going?

513
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,394
Where?

514
00:39:02,505 --> 00:39:04,063
I haven't figured that out yet,

515
00:39:04,174 --> 00:39:06,642
but I'll send you a postcard when I get there.

516
00:39:06,743 --> 00:39:09,507
What about your friend, the tall lady?

517
00:39:09,612 --> 00:39:11,011
We are not friends anymore.

518
00:39:11,114 --> 00:39:14,379
That's what happens with tall people sometimes.

519
00:39:14,484 --> 00:39:17,248
Well, goodbye.

520
00:39:36,539 --> 00:39:39,303
Spent a lot of time by myself that year.

521
00:39:40,677 --> 00:39:41,905
Hello?

522
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,443
- Hi.
- I'm moving in today.

523
00:39:45,548 --> 00:39:48,381
Welcome. We've been expecting you.

524
00:39:48,485 --> 00:39:51,511
Can you please show her up to Mrs. Rousseau's old room?

525
00:39:51,621 --> 00:39:54,954
I'm sorry, but we usually
don't allow dogs in the house.

526
00:39:55,058 --> 00:39:58,050
Well, she's old as the hills. She's almost blind.

527
00:39:58,161 --> 00:40:01,096
She won't be a bother much longer.

528
00:40:01,197 --> 00:40:04,894
Well, all right, long as she stays from up underfoot.

529
00:40:05,001 --> 00:40:06,195
Right this way, ma'am.

530
00:40:06,302 --> 00:40:09,430
As hard as I try, I can't remember her name.

531
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:12,667
Mrs. Lawson, or Mrs. Hartford.

532
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,473
Maybe it was Maple.

533
00:40:15,578 --> 00:40:17,910
It's funny how sometimes the
people we remember the least

534
00:40:18,014 --> 00:40:20,539
make the greatest impression on us.

535
00:40:21,151 --> 00:40:23,483
I do remember she wore diamonds.

536
00:40:23,586 --> 00:40:27,386
And she always dressed in fine
clothing, as if she was going out.

537
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:31,051
Although she never did and
nobody ever came to visit her.

538
00:40:32,796 --> 00:40:35,128
She taught me to play the piano.

539
00:40:40,503 --> 00:40:43,131
It's not about how well you play.

540
00:40:43,873 --> 00:40:46,706
It's how you feel about what you're playing.

541
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:48,141
Try this.

542
00:41:04,494 --> 00:41:07,725
You can't help putting yourself in the music.

543
00:41:15,805 --> 00:41:17,796
There were many changes.

544
00:41:17,907 --> 00:41:20,967
Some you could see, some you couldn't.

545
00:41:22,111 --> 00:41:24,944
Hair had started growing in all sorts of places,

546
00:41:25,482 --> 00:41:27,450
along with other things.

547
00:41:28,751 --> 00:41:31,481
I felt pretty good, considering.

548
00:41:32,555 --> 00:41:35,217
Darling, the pain.

549
00:41:35,325 --> 00:41:37,850
All right, Mom, I'll get the nurse.

550
00:41:40,396 --> 00:41:43,058
Look at this eye. This is a major hurricane,

551
00:41:43,633 --> 00:41:46,158
a slow hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of...

552
00:41:46,269 --> 00:41:48,100
Not doing too good?

553
00:41:48,972 --> 00:41:52,237
Nobody seems to know whether to stay or leave.

554
00:41:52,342 --> 00:41:54,640
I'm gonna ride it out.

555
00:41:54,744 --> 00:41:57,611
There. That should make things much easier.

556
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:04,247
Have you had a chance to say your goodbyes?

557
00:42:04,354 --> 00:42:07,846
My father waited four hours for my
brother to get here from Boger City.

558
00:42:07,957 --> 00:42:09,925
Couldn't go without him.

559
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:13,122
- She seems like a sweet woman.
- Yeah.

560
00:42:13,796 --> 00:42:15,491
I haven't had as much time with her as I would have...

561
00:42:15,598 --> 00:42:17,498
- You busy? I could use your help.
- Excuse me.

562
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,828
Sure.

563
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:39,045
"Queenie would let me go with Mr. Daws..."

564
00:42:39,155 --> 00:42:42,955
to Poverty Point to watch the
boats go up and down the river.

565
00:42:43,059 --> 00:42:44,993
These were hard times.

566
00:42:48,031 --> 00:42:51,728
Did I ever tell you I was
struck by lightning seven times?

567
00:42:52,669 --> 00:42:56,070
Once when I was in the field, just tending to my cows.

568
00:43:02,612 --> 00:43:04,876
My fourth hand didn't show up.

569
00:43:07,116 --> 00:43:10,574
Anybody want to make $2 for a day's work 'round here?

570
00:43:12,522 --> 00:43:14,217
What's the matter?

571
00:43:14,324 --> 00:43:17,054
Nobody wants to do an honest
day's work for an honest day's pay?

572
00:43:17,193 --> 00:43:18,717
He never pays.

573
00:43:20,196 --> 00:43:22,494
- Nobody wants a job?
- I do.

574
00:43:24,133 --> 00:43:26,966
You got your sea legs about you, old man?

575
00:43:28,071 --> 00:43:29,436
I think.

576
00:43:33,409 --> 00:43:35,843
Well, that's good enough for me.

577
00:43:35,945 --> 00:43:39,403
Get your ass on board. We'll sure as hell find out.

578
00:43:44,921 --> 00:43:46,548
I was as happy as I could be.

579
00:43:46,656 --> 00:43:47,918
I need a volunteer!

580
00:43:48,024 --> 00:43:49,355
I would do anything.

581
00:43:49,459 --> 00:43:50,892
Yes, Captain!

582
00:43:50,994 --> 00:43:53,292
Scrape off all this bird shit!

583
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:55,725
Right away, sir.

584
00:43:56,566 --> 00:44:01,026
And I was actually gonna be paid for
something I would have done for free.

585
00:44:02,705 --> 00:44:05,037
His name was Captain Mike Clark.

586
00:44:06,042 --> 00:44:08,943
He'd been on a tugboat since he was seven.

587
00:44:09,979 --> 00:44:11,708
Get moving, then.

588
00:44:12,649 --> 00:44:14,139
Come here.

589
00:44:16,219 --> 00:44:19,313
Can you still get it up?

590
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:22,681
I do every morning.

591
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:26,760
The old pole, huh? The high, hard one?

592
00:44:27,397 --> 00:44:28,694
I guess.

593
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,928
When was the last time you had a woman?

594
00:44:36,472 --> 00:44:38,372
- Never.
- Never?

595
00:44:38,875 --> 00:44:40,934
Not that I know of, sir.

596
00:44:41,444 --> 00:44:43,207
Wait a minute, now.

597
00:44:44,013 --> 00:44:48,143
You mean to say you've been on
this earth however many years

598
00:44:48,251 --> 00:44:51,516
and you've never had a woman?

599
00:44:56,192 --> 00:44:59,252
Damn, that's the saddest thing
I've ever heard in my life.

600
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:01,958
Never?

601
00:45:02,732 --> 00:45:03,824
No.

602
00:45:06,469 --> 00:45:10,565
Well, then, by Jesus, you are coming with me.

603
00:45:21,584 --> 00:45:23,176
What did your father do?

604
00:45:23,286 --> 00:45:25,311
I never met my father.

605
00:45:25,421 --> 00:45:27,355
You lucky bastard.

606
00:45:28,257 --> 00:45:30,885
All fathers want to do is hold you down.

607
00:45:33,529 --> 00:45:36,930
Out on my father's boat, working the two-a-day,

608
00:45:37,266 --> 00:45:39,700
this little, fat bastard.

609
00:45:39,802 --> 00:45:41,497
"Tug Irish," they called him.

610
00:45:41,604 --> 00:45:44,971
Anyway, I finally work up the nerve and tell him,

611
00:45:45,875 --> 00:45:49,572
"I don't want to spend the rest
of my life on a goddamn tugboat."

612
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:51,647
You know what I'm saying?

613
00:45:52,048 --> 00:45:54,710
You don't want to spend the
rest of your life on a tugboat.

614
00:45:54,817 --> 00:45:57,115
Absolutely! Damn right!

615
00:45:59,889 --> 00:46:02,483
So you know what my father says to me?

616
00:46:03,326 --> 00:46:07,763
He says, "Who the hell do you think you are?

617
00:46:07,864 --> 00:46:10,594
"What the hell do you think you can do?"

618
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,561
So I tell him.

619
00:46:13,202 --> 00:46:16,399
"Well, if you're asking,

620
00:46:18,674 --> 00:46:20,699
"I want to be an artist."

621
00:46:21,277 --> 00:46:23,177
He laughs.

622
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:28,673
"An artist? God meant for you
to work a tugboat, just like me.

623
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:31,413
"And that's exactly what you're gonna do."

624
00:46:31,521 --> 00:46:34,752
Well, I turned myself into an artist.

625
00:46:37,226 --> 00:46:38,955
A tattoo artist!

626
00:46:41,397 --> 00:46:44,195
I put on every one of these myself.

627
00:46:46,736 --> 00:46:50,536
You have to skin me alive to
take my art away from me now.

628
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:54,832
When I'm dead, I'm gonna send him my arm.

629
00:46:56,112 --> 00:46:57,511
That one.

630
00:46:59,849 --> 00:47:02,477
Don't let anyone tell you different.

631
00:47:02,585 --> 00:47:05,179
You gotta do what you're meant to do.

632
00:47:05,288 --> 00:47:08,382
And I happen to be a goddamned artist.

633
00:47:08,991 --> 00:47:11,289
But you're a tugboat captain.

634
00:47:11,894 --> 00:47:13,623
Captain Mike?

635
00:47:13,729 --> 00:47:16,459
We're ready for you and your friend.

636
00:47:18,201 --> 00:47:21,227
Let's go, old timer, eh? Break your cherry.

637
00:47:22,438 --> 00:47:25,134
- Hello, my lovelies!
- Hey, Captain.

638
00:47:25,274 --> 00:47:26,241
- Hi, Captain.
- Hi.

639
00:47:28,411 --> 00:47:29,503
- Hi.
- Hi.

640
00:47:29,612 --> 00:47:32,638
He gives me the willies. That is not for me.

641
00:47:34,584 --> 00:47:36,848
How are you tonight, grandpa?

642
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,647
It was a night to remember.

643
00:47:45,394 --> 00:47:49,057
What are you, Dick Tracy or
something? I've got to rest.

644
00:47:50,199 --> 00:47:51,427
Again.

645
00:47:52,735 --> 00:47:55,067
- Thank you.
- No, thank you. You have a nice night.

646
00:47:55,171 --> 00:47:57,298
- Will you be here tomorrow?
- Every night but Sunday.

647
00:47:57,406 --> 00:48:01,103
It sure made me understand
the value of earning a living.

648
00:48:01,744 --> 00:48:03,575
Good night, sweetie. Come back now.

649
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:05,874
Things money can buy you.

650
00:48:23,566 --> 00:48:25,227
It's nasty out.

651
00:48:25,701 --> 00:48:28,602
Can I offer you a ride somewhere?

652
00:48:30,373 --> 00:48:32,637
Well, that's awfully kind of you, sir.

653
00:48:41,984 --> 00:48:44,452
My name is Thomas, Thomas Button.

654
00:48:45,121 --> 00:48:47,214
- I'm Benjamin.
- Benjamin.

655
00:48:48,491 --> 00:48:50,618
It's a pleasure to know you.

656
00:48:52,161 --> 00:48:55,392
Would you like to stop somewhere and have a drink?

657
00:48:55,498 --> 00:48:56,863
All right.

658
00:48:58,167 --> 00:49:00,431
Evening, Mr. Button.

659
00:49:05,007 --> 00:49:06,941
What'll it be, sir?

660
00:49:07,677 --> 00:49:10,703
- I'll have whatever he's having.
- Sazerac for the both of us.

661
00:49:10,813 --> 00:49:13,179
With whiskey, not brandy.

662
00:49:13,282 --> 00:49:14,772
You don't drink, do you?

663
00:49:14,884 --> 00:49:17,478
- It's a night for firsts.
- How's that?

664
00:49:17,586 --> 00:49:19,645
I've never been to a brothel, either.

665
00:49:19,755 --> 00:49:22,519
Well, it's an experience.

666
00:49:22,658 --> 00:49:25,752
It certainly is. There's a time for everything.

667
00:49:25,861 --> 00:49:28,261
- True enough.
- Your drinks.

668
00:49:29,932 --> 00:49:35,131
I don't mean to be rude, but
your hands. Is that painful?

669
00:49:35,471 --> 00:49:38,099
Well, I was born with some form of disease.

670
00:49:38,207 --> 00:49:39,765
What kind of disease?

671
00:49:39,875 --> 00:49:41,604
I was born old.

672
00:49:43,145 --> 00:49:44,840
- I'm sorry.
- No need to be.

673
00:49:44,947 --> 00:49:47,472
There's nothing wrong with old age.

674
00:49:56,359 --> 00:49:59,385
My wife passed away many years ago.

675
00:50:00,796 --> 00:50:02,627
I'm so, so sorry.

676
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:05,965
She died in childbirth.

677
00:50:09,472 --> 00:50:11,997
- To children.
- To mothers.

678
00:50:16,846 --> 00:50:19,110
What line of work you in, Mr. Button?

679
00:50:19,215 --> 00:50:23,345
Buttons. Button's Buttons. There
isn't a button that we don't make.

680
00:50:25,554 --> 00:50:27,920
Our biggest competition is B.F. Goodrich

681
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:29,753
and his infernal zippers.

682
00:50:29,859 --> 00:50:32,657
Would you gentlemen like anything else?

683
00:50:32,762 --> 00:50:34,787
One for the road, Benjamin?

684
00:50:34,897 --> 00:50:37,730
Only if you let me pay for it, Mr. Button.

685
00:50:39,001 --> 00:50:41,469
So, what line of work do you do?

686
00:50:42,905 --> 00:50:45,339
I'm a tugboat man.

687
00:50:51,547 --> 00:50:53,572
I enjoyed talking to you.

688
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:56,177
I enjoyed drinking with you.

689
00:50:59,789 --> 00:51:01,188
Benjamin?

690
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:04,726
Would you mind if, time to time,
I stopped by and said hello?

691
00:51:04,827 --> 00:51:08,228
Anytime. Good night, Mr. Button.

692
00:51:08,764 --> 00:51:10,527
Good night, Benjamin.

693
00:51:11,267 --> 00:51:12,632
Drive on.

694
00:51:18,307 --> 00:51:19,638
Where have you been?

695
00:51:19,742 --> 00:51:24,736
Nothing. I met some people and listened to some music.

696
00:51:27,516 --> 00:51:29,711
Oh, sweet Jesus, boy!

697
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:33,813
Growing up's a funny thing. Sneaks up on you.

698
00:51:34,757 --> 00:51:39,091
One person is there, then suddenly
somebody else has taken her place.

699
00:51:39,695 --> 00:51:41,356
She wasn't all elbows and knees anymore.

700
00:51:41,464 --> 00:51:43,159
Benjamin! Come on!

701
00:51:43,532 --> 00:51:44,897
Okay.

702
00:51:46,168 --> 00:51:47,726
I loved those weekends when she'd come

703
00:51:47,837 --> 00:51:50,635
and spend the night with her grandmother.

704
00:51:58,714 --> 00:52:01,182
Daisy. Daisy.

705
00:52:02,384 --> 00:52:04,511
You want to see something?

706
00:52:05,688 --> 00:52:10,455
You gotta keep it a secret, so get
dressed. I'll meet you out back.

707
00:52:15,998 --> 00:52:17,363
Come on.

708
00:52:19,168 --> 00:52:22,296
- Can you swim?
- I can do anything you can do.

709
00:52:22,404 --> 00:52:24,998
Here, put this on. We gotta hurry.

710
00:52:37,953 --> 00:52:39,477
Is he okay?

711
00:52:39,588 --> 00:52:41,021
Captain?

712
00:52:42,658 --> 00:52:44,148
Captain Mike?

713
00:52:47,897 --> 00:52:50,593
Morning, Captain. Can you take us out?

714
00:52:51,767 --> 00:52:54,065
Do you know what day it is?

715
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:55,432
Sunday?

716
00:52:55,538 --> 00:52:57,665
Do you know what that means?

717
00:52:59,008 --> 00:53:01,408
Means I was very drunk last night.

718
00:53:02,011 --> 00:53:04,275
Well, you're drunk every night.

719
00:53:06,749 --> 00:53:09,013
- Is that a girl?
- Close friend.

720
00:53:09,752 --> 00:53:10,844
I want to show her the river.

721
00:53:10,953 --> 00:53:14,252
You're not supposed to go joyriding with civilians.

722
00:53:15,424 --> 00:53:17,551
I could lose my license.

723
00:53:27,369 --> 00:53:28,836
What are you waiting for?

724
00:53:59,034 --> 00:54:02,128
Pulled in for repair a wounded duck.

725
00:54:03,572 --> 00:54:05,699
She's flying now, huh?

726
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:07,869
Ahoy, sailor!

727
00:54:12,448 --> 00:54:14,780
I wish we could go with them.

728
00:54:20,789 --> 00:54:23,053
Did you say something, Mom?

729
00:54:30,833 --> 00:54:32,801
It's getting really bad.

730
00:54:34,837 --> 00:54:36,600
Can you hear me, Mom?

731
00:54:39,241 --> 00:54:41,903
Time just seeped out of me.

732
00:54:48,684 --> 00:54:50,481
"Things were changing quickly."

733
00:54:50,586 --> 00:54:54,682
I don't know how it's possible,
but you seem to have more hair.

734
00:54:56,225 --> 00:54:59,194
What if I told you that I wasn't getting older,

735
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:02,594
but I was getting younger than everybody else?

736
00:55:02,698 --> 00:55:06,600
Well, I'd feel sorry for you,

737
00:55:06,702 --> 00:55:09,535
to have to see everybody you love die before you do.

738
00:55:09,638 --> 00:55:11,538
It's an awful responsibility.

739
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:15,201
I'd never thought about life or death that way before.

740
00:55:16,845 --> 00:55:20,906
Benjamin, we're meant to lose the people we love.

741
00:55:21,383 --> 00:55:24,750
How else would we know how important they are to us?

742
00:55:27,856 --> 00:55:32,316
And one fall day, a familiar
visitor came knocking on our door.

743
00:55:34,063 --> 00:55:36,861
You want to go with me to the drugstore?

744
00:55:47,009 --> 00:55:49,375
She taught me how to play the piano.

745
00:55:49,478 --> 00:55:50,740
- Amen.
- Amen.

746
00:55:50,846 --> 00:55:54,009
And she taught me what it meant to miss somebody.

747
00:55:58,587 --> 00:56:00,020
Let's go.

748
00:56:01,056 --> 00:56:02,990
I had gone to a brothel.

749
00:56:03,092 --> 00:56:05,390
I'd had my first drink.

750
00:56:05,494 --> 00:56:08,952
Said goodbye to one friend and buried another.

751
00:56:09,498 --> 00:56:14,367
In 1936, when I was coming to the
end of the 17th year of my life,

752
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:17,303
I packed my bag, said goodbye.

753
00:56:17,406 --> 00:56:19,738
- Bye, Benjamin.
- Goodbye.

754
00:56:19,842 --> 00:56:24,302
I knew, life being what it was,
I'd probably never see them again.

755
00:56:26,515 --> 00:56:28,142
Bye, Mr. Benjamin.

756
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:30,718
- Good luck to you, son.
- Thank you.

757
00:56:35,257 --> 00:56:38,158
- I love you, Mama.
- I love you, too, baby.

758
00:56:39,361 --> 00:56:42,592
I want you to say your prayers every night, hear?

759
00:56:47,469 --> 00:56:49,494
Be safe, hear?

760
00:57:00,916 --> 00:57:02,281
Benjamin!

761
00:57:05,387 --> 00:57:08,015
- Where you going?
- To sea.

762
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:11,484
I'll send you a postcard.

763
00:57:13,328 --> 00:57:15,262
From everywhere.

764
00:57:15,364 --> 00:57:17,958
Write me a postcard from everywhere.

765
00:57:32,481 --> 00:57:34,346
Can you imagine?

766
00:57:36,752 --> 00:57:42,850
He sent me a postcard from everywhere he went.

767
00:57:44,426 --> 00:57:46,394
Every place he worked.

768
00:57:47,729 --> 00:57:50,789
Newfoundland. Baffin Bay.

769
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:54,460
Glasgow. Liverpool. Narvik.

770
00:57:55,270 --> 00:58:00,003
He had gone with that Captain Mike.

771
00:58:02,044 --> 00:58:04,274
Captain Mike had contracted for three years

772
00:58:04,379 --> 00:58:06,677
with Moran Brothers Tug and Salvage.

773
00:58:06,782 --> 00:58:10,650
The old ship had been refitted with
a diesel engine and a new sea winch.

774
00:58:10,752 --> 00:58:13,653
We went around Florida and up the Atlantic seaboard.

775
00:58:13,755 --> 00:58:17,156
We were a crew of seven now. Captain Mike and me.

776
00:58:17,259 --> 00:58:20,592
Cookie, Prentiss Mayes from Wilmington, Delaware.

777
00:58:20,696 --> 00:58:23,096
The Brody twins, Rick and Vic,

778
00:58:23,198 --> 00:58:25,428
who got along fine at sea but, for some reason,

779
00:58:25,534 --> 00:58:28,594
once they were on dry land couldn't
stand the sight of each other.

780
00:58:28,704 --> 00:58:32,265
You know, one in every eight boats never returns.

781
00:58:32,374 --> 00:58:34,501
There was John Grimm, who sure fit his name.

782
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:36,441
All hands lost at sea.

783
00:58:36,545 --> 00:58:38,775
From Belvedere, South Dakota.

784
00:58:40,182 --> 00:58:43,015
And Pleasant Curtis from Asheville, Notch.

785
00:58:43,118 --> 00:58:46,281
Never said a word to anyone, except himself.

786
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:51,284
I wrote him constantly.

787
00:58:52,928 --> 00:58:57,922
I told him I had been invited
to audition in New York City

788
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:01,162
for the School of American Ballet.

789
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:02,669
Please stay.

790
00:59:02,771 --> 00:59:04,898
Thank you. Thank you.

791
00:59:06,875 --> 00:59:08,137
You can stay.

792
00:59:10,646 --> 00:59:13,706
But I was relegated to the corps.

793
00:59:14,049 --> 00:59:16,415
Another dancing gypsy.

794
00:59:20,722 --> 00:59:22,246
Benjamin!

795
00:59:22,891 --> 00:59:25,359
How is it when you showed up

796
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:29,328
you were no bigger than a bollard
with one foot in the grave,

797
00:59:29,431 --> 00:59:33,629
but now, either I drink a hell
of a lot more than I think I do,

798
00:59:34,903 --> 00:59:36,530
or you sprouted?

799
00:59:37,439 --> 00:59:39,202
What's your secret?

800
00:59:40,642 --> 00:59:42,200
Well, Captain,

801
00:59:44,012 --> 00:59:45,809
you do drink a lot.

802
00:59:50,619 --> 00:59:54,885
We stayed in a small hotel with
a grand name, The Winter Palace.

803
00:59:54,990 --> 00:59:57,754
You have no idea what you're talking about.

804
00:59:57,859 --> 01:00:01,317
The hummingbird is not just another bird.

805
01:00:02,064 --> 01:00:05,761
Its heart rate's 1,200 beats per minute.

806
01:00:07,536 --> 01:00:10,232
Its wings beat 80 times a second.

807
01:00:12,174 --> 01:00:15,166
If you was to stop their wings from beating,

808
01:00:15,811 --> 01:00:18,644
it would be dead in less than 10 seconds.

809
01:00:19,648 --> 01:00:22,310
This is no ordinary bird.

810
01:00:22,985 --> 01:00:25,078
This is a fricking miracle.

811
01:00:28,256 --> 01:00:32,158
They slowed down their wings with moving pictures,

812
01:00:32,828 --> 01:00:35,023
and you know what they saw?

813
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:38,328
Their wingtips are doing that.

814
01:00:42,371 --> 01:00:46,205
You know what the figure eight
is the mathematical symbol for?

815
01:00:49,211 --> 01:00:50,735
Infinity.

816
01:00:50,846 --> 01:00:52,177
Infinity!

817
01:00:55,684 --> 01:00:58,585
Everybody, no matter what differences they had,

818
01:00:58,687 --> 01:01:02,714
the languages, the color of their
skin, had one thing in common.

819
01:01:03,659 --> 01:01:06,025
They were drunk every single night.

820
01:01:06,128 --> 01:01:07,652
Three, please.

821
01:01:07,763 --> 01:01:09,355
Could you hold, dear, for us, please?

822
01:01:09,464 --> 01:01:11,728
Thank you very much. Good evening.

823
01:01:11,833 --> 01:01:14,529
Her name was Elizabeth Abbott.

824
01:01:14,636 --> 01:01:17,935
She was not beautiful. She was plain as paper.

825
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:20,838
But she was pretty as any picture to me.

826
01:01:22,144 --> 01:01:24,169
What are you looking at?

827
01:01:26,415 --> 01:01:28,940
If you must know, we have a longstanding agreement

828
01:01:29,051 --> 01:01:30,416
never to go to bed sober.

829
01:01:30,519 --> 01:01:32,919
- Isn't that right, darling?
- Whatever you say, darling.

830
01:01:33,021 --> 01:01:35,080
Her husband was Walter Abbott.

831
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:39,092
He was Chief Minister of the
British Trade Mission in Murmansk,

832
01:01:39,194 --> 01:01:40,821
and he was a spy.

833
01:01:40,929 --> 01:01:43,796
- Darling.
- Oh, thank you, my darling.

834
01:01:43,899 --> 01:01:45,924
- Key, darling.
- Oh, yes.

835
01:01:50,439 --> 01:01:53,465
I broke my heel off one of my shoes.

836
01:01:53,575 --> 01:01:57,170
I'm not in the habit of walking
about in my stocking feet.

837
01:02:01,583 --> 01:02:03,744
They were long days there.

838
01:02:11,259 --> 01:02:13,227
And even longer nights.

839
01:02:15,430 --> 01:02:18,991
One particular night, I was having trouble sleeping.

840
01:02:20,435 --> 01:02:21,959
I'm sorry.

841
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:25,568
I couldn't sleep.

842
01:02:38,487 --> 01:02:41,945
I was gonna make some tea. Would you like some?

843
01:02:42,858 --> 01:02:44,689
Oh, no. Thank you.

844
01:03:22,531 --> 01:03:24,089
Milk? Honey?

845
01:03:24,733 --> 01:03:26,667
A bit of honey, please.

846
01:03:27,202 --> 01:03:28,965
I hope you like flies in your honey.

847
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:30,731
Oh, perhaps not.

848
01:03:45,587 --> 01:03:49,819
Oh, maybe better to let it steep a little.

849
01:03:50,826 --> 01:03:52,020
Steep?

850
01:03:52,394 --> 01:03:53,452
Soak.

851
01:03:53,728 --> 01:03:57,391
I don't know, I mean, there's
a proper way of making tea.

852
01:03:57,499 --> 01:04:00,730
Well, where I'm from, people just want it to be hot.

853
01:04:00,836 --> 01:04:02,929
Well, quite right.

854
01:04:11,847 --> 01:04:14,247
- Now, you're a seaman.
- A sailor.

855
01:04:14,349 --> 01:04:17,079
I hope you won't think me impolite, but I have to ask,

856
01:04:17,185 --> 01:04:19,312
aren't you a little old to be working on a boat?

857
01:04:19,421 --> 01:04:22,822
There's no age limit, as long as you can do the work.

858
01:04:33,635 --> 01:04:35,933
And you have trouble sleeping? Thank you.

859
01:04:36,037 --> 01:04:39,234
I didn't think I did. I usually sleep like a baby.

860
01:04:40,208 --> 01:04:42,642
Something's been keeping me up.

861
01:04:43,879 --> 01:04:45,073
My father, in his 80s,

862
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:48,445
he was so convinced he was gonna die in his sleep,

863
01:04:49,084 --> 01:04:52,212
he limited himself to having afternoon naps.

864
01:04:52,988 --> 01:04:55,752
He was so determined he was gonna cheat death.

865
01:04:56,925 --> 01:04:58,790
- Did he?
- Did he what?

866
01:04:58,927 --> 01:05:00,554
Die in his sleep?

867
01:05:02,264 --> 01:05:04,858
He died sitting in his favorite chair

868
01:05:04,966 --> 01:05:07,594
listening to his favorite program on the wireless.

869
01:05:07,702 --> 01:05:10,170
He must have known something.

870
01:05:15,911 --> 01:05:20,974
My husband's the British Trade Minister,
and we've been here for 14 months.

871
01:05:21,082 --> 01:05:24,415
- Good God.
- We were supposed to go to Peking

872
01:05:24,519 --> 01:05:27,977
but it never seemed to work out.

873
01:05:29,457 --> 01:05:31,152
Have you been in the Far East?

874
01:05:31,259 --> 01:05:33,454
No. I've never been anywhere, really.

875
01:05:33,561 --> 01:05:35,995
I mean, outside of harbors.

876
01:05:36,097 --> 01:05:37,758
And where is it that you're from?

877
01:05:37,866 --> 01:05:40,357
New Orleans. Louisiana.

878
01:05:41,870 --> 01:05:44,168
I didn't know there was another.

879
01:05:46,474 --> 01:05:51,502
And she told me about all the places
she had been, and what she had seen.

880
01:05:53,114 --> 01:05:56,015
And we talked till just before the dawn.

881
01:05:57,052 --> 01:05:58,519
I'm just a lush, myself.

882
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:03,557
And we went back to our rooms, to our separate lives.

883
01:06:08,997 --> 01:06:12,296
But every night, we'd meet again in that lobby.

884
01:06:17,639 --> 01:06:21,541
A hotel in the middle of the
night can be a magical place.

885
01:06:24,412 --> 01:06:27,313
A mouse running, and stopping.

886
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:30,843
A radiator hissing.

887
01:06:31,853 --> 01:06:33,718
A curtain blowing.

888
01:06:37,492 --> 01:06:40,859
There's something peaceful, even comforting

889
01:06:40,962 --> 01:06:44,193
knowing that the people you
love are asleep in their beds

890
01:06:44,299 --> 01:06:46,529
where nothing can harm them.

891
01:06:49,637 --> 01:06:52,572
Elizabeth and I would lose track of the night

892
01:06:53,108 --> 01:06:55,269
until just before daybreak.

893
01:06:57,879 --> 01:07:00,677
I think I may have given you the wrong impression.

894
01:07:00,782 --> 01:07:02,306
Beg pardon?

895
01:07:02,417 --> 01:07:06,217
Well, married women don't customarily sit around

896
01:07:06,321 --> 01:07:08,346
in the middle of the night with strange men in hotels.

897
01:07:08,456 --> 01:07:11,983
I wouldn't know what a married
woman does or doesn't do.

898
01:07:17,766 --> 01:07:19,199
Good night.

899
01:07:21,536 --> 01:07:22,833
Murmansk.

900
01:07:25,473 --> 01:07:28,533
"I've met somebody, and I've fallen in love."

901
01:07:28,643 --> 01:07:29,837
Mom?

902
01:07:33,681 --> 01:07:36,206
That was over 60 years ago.

903
01:07:37,519 --> 01:07:38,543
Did you love him, Mother?

904
01:07:38,653 --> 01:07:41,417
What does a girl know about love?

905
01:08:15,023 --> 01:08:16,217
Well...

906
01:08:18,726 --> 01:08:22,492
- I'm not dressed.
- Oh, you look splendid, just as you are.

907
01:08:24,766 --> 01:08:27,826
Don't waste any time bothering about
the wine or the cheese in Murmansk,

908
01:08:27,936 --> 01:08:30,962
'cause they're really completely ordinary,

909
01:08:31,072 --> 01:08:36,032
but the caviar and the vodka

910
01:08:36,611 --> 01:08:40,707
are sublime and plentiful.

911
01:08:44,519 --> 01:08:45,781
So.

912
01:08:51,092 --> 01:08:52,389
Savor it.

913
01:08:54,529 --> 01:08:56,497
And don't eat it all at once,

914
01:08:56,598 --> 01:08:59,692
because that way, there's nothing left to enjoy.

915
01:09:01,369 --> 01:09:05,703
And now, take a little swallow of
vodka while it's still in your mouth.

916
01:09:20,588 --> 01:09:23,421
You haven't been with many women, have you?

917
01:09:24,626 --> 01:09:26,253
Not on Sundays.

918
01:09:28,463 --> 01:09:30,192
And you've never had caviar before, have you?

919
01:09:30,298 --> 01:09:31,925
No, ma'am.

920
01:09:37,772 --> 01:09:39,433
When I was 19,

921
01:09:40,441 --> 01:09:46,710
I attempted to become the first woman
ever to swim the English Channel.

922
01:09:47,715 --> 01:09:49,114
Really?

923
01:09:49,751 --> 01:09:52,777
But the current that day was so strong that,

924
01:09:52,887 --> 01:09:55,981
for every stroke I took, I was pushed back two.

925
01:09:56,591 --> 01:09:59,185
I was in the water for 32 hours.

926
01:10:00,161 --> 01:10:03,995
And when I was two miles from Calais,

927
01:10:05,133 --> 01:10:06,862
it started to rain.

928
01:10:07,602 --> 01:10:09,502
That's it! Steady on!

929
01:10:10,038 --> 01:10:12,666
When I couldn't go any further,

930
01:10:14,275 --> 01:10:15,708
I stopped.

931
01:10:17,111 --> 01:10:18,703
I just stopped.

932
01:10:19,314 --> 01:10:24,183
And everybody asked me, would I try again?

933
01:10:24,919 --> 01:10:26,784
For why wouldn't I?

934
01:10:29,691 --> 01:10:31,386
But I never did.

935
01:10:32,827 --> 01:10:37,059
As a matter of fact, I've never done
anything with my life after that.

936
01:10:41,202 --> 01:10:43,227
Your hands are so coarse.

937
01:10:53,581 --> 01:10:56,141
I can feel the wind in your cheek.

938
01:11:02,924 --> 01:11:05,415
I'm afraid it's the witching hour.

939
01:11:11,332 --> 01:11:14,563
It was the first time a woman had ever kissed me.

940
01:11:15,136 --> 01:11:17,536
It's something you never forget.

941
01:11:28,049 --> 01:11:30,074
I think you make me feel younger.

942
01:11:30,184 --> 01:11:32,709
You make me feel years younger, too.

943
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:34,412
I wish I was.

944
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:37,550
So many things I'd change.

945
01:11:38,259 --> 01:11:40,591
I'd undo all my mistakes.

946
01:11:40,695 --> 01:11:42,390
What mistakes?

947
01:11:45,733 --> 01:11:47,894
I kept waiting, you know?

948
01:11:48,536 --> 01:11:53,030
Thinking that I'd do something
to change my circumstances.

949
01:11:54,309 --> 01:11:56,038
Do something.

950
01:11:57,612 --> 01:12:00,843
Such an awful waste. You never get it back.

951
01:12:01,316 --> 01:12:02,783
Wasted time.

952
01:12:09,090 --> 01:12:11,490
If we're going to have an affair,

953
01:12:12,226 --> 01:12:15,059
you're never to look at me during the day.

954
01:12:15,697 --> 01:12:18,632
And we're always to part before sunrise.

955
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:21,928
And we will never say "I love you."

956
01:12:23,571 --> 01:12:25,368
Those are the rules.

957
01:12:27,975 --> 01:12:30,136
- Are you cold?
- I'm freezing.

958
01:12:30,244 --> 01:12:32,178
Oh, you! You're frozen.

959
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:35,477
What an idiot, I'm standing here
in this fur. How thoughtless of me.

960
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:11,948
She was the first woman that ever loved me.

961
01:13:14,922 --> 01:13:16,150
You want me to skip some?

962
01:13:16,257 --> 01:13:22,025
No, I'm glad he had somebody to keep him warm.

963
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:28,168
"I couldn't wait to see her again."

964
01:13:41,082 --> 01:13:43,380
We saw each other every night.

965
01:13:43,985 --> 01:13:46,283
We always used the same room.

966
01:13:48,256 --> 01:13:51,589
But each time seemed new and different.

967
01:13:52,994 --> 01:13:54,427
Come here.

968
01:14:01,903 --> 01:14:03,302
Elizabeth.

969
01:14:04,672 --> 01:14:06,071
Good night.

970
01:14:08,776 --> 01:14:10,403
Until one night.

971
01:14:47,682 --> 01:14:53,279
Yesterday, December 7th, 1941,

972
01:14:53,387 --> 01:14:56,481
a date which will live in infamy...

973
01:14:56,591 --> 01:15:00,721
It's a meeting, a policy meeting regarding your future,

974
01:15:01,662 --> 01:15:03,220
possibly beyond.

975
01:15:04,632 --> 01:15:07,192
There's been a change of plan, lads.

976
01:15:07,401 --> 01:15:09,995
As you may or may not know,

977
01:15:10,104 --> 01:15:12,698
the Japs bombed Pearl Harbor yesterday.

978
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:16,598
Frank D. Roosevelt's asked each of us to do our part.

979
01:15:17,111 --> 01:15:21,207
The Chelsea's been commissioned
to serve in the United States Navy.

980
01:15:21,649 --> 01:15:24,914
To repair, to salvage, and to rescue.

981
01:15:26,454 --> 01:15:30,788
Anybody doesn't want to go to
war, now is the time to say so.

982
01:15:30,892 --> 01:15:35,090
Once you set foot on that boat,
you're in the Navy, friend.

983
01:15:38,332 --> 01:15:41,358
Yeah, I've been meaning to talk with you, Mike.

984
01:15:41,469 --> 01:15:43,460
My wife's doing poorly.

985
01:15:43,571 --> 01:15:46,301
I'd like to maybe see her one more time.

986
01:15:48,042 --> 01:15:51,842
You're free to make your way
home any way you can, Mr. Mayes.

987
01:15:57,485 --> 01:15:59,248
Well, if he's leaving, who's gonna cook?

988
01:15:59,353 --> 01:16:03,414
Food poisoning's one of the
leading causes of death at sea.

989
01:16:03,524 --> 01:16:05,890
Right after inadequate safety equipment.

990
01:16:05,993 --> 01:16:08,621
I can cook, Captain. Been doing it all my life.

991
01:16:08,729 --> 01:16:13,132
I don't know. You're a little moody for war, Benjamin.

992
01:16:13,234 --> 01:16:15,202
What the hell?

993
01:16:15,303 --> 01:16:19,637
I'll take any man wants to kick the
shite out of the Japs and the Huns.

994
01:16:21,042 --> 01:16:24,808
That's it, pack your gear.
We're going to war, gentlemen!

995
01:16:31,686 --> 01:16:33,449
She had left a note.

996
01:16:34,822 --> 01:16:37,552
She wrote, "It was nice to have met you."

997
01:16:38,326 --> 01:16:39,918
And that was it.

998
01:16:43,164 --> 01:16:46,224
It wasn't the war any of us expected.

999
01:16:46,334 --> 01:16:49,963
We would just tow crippled
ships, scraps of metal, really.

1000
01:16:50,571 --> 01:16:53,540
If there was a war, we didn't see it.

1001
01:16:55,443 --> 01:16:59,504
There was a man assigned to us.
The Chief Gunner loved the Navy.

1002
01:16:59,614 --> 01:17:01,809
But most of all, he loved America.

1003
01:17:01,916 --> 01:17:04,817
There is no other country in the world.

1004
01:17:04,919 --> 01:17:06,011
When you spell America...

1005
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:10,284
His name was Dennis Smith, and
he was a full-blooded Cherokee.

1006
01:17:10,391 --> 01:17:13,485
His family had been Americans for over 500 years.

1007
01:17:13,594 --> 01:17:18,122
These pacifists. They say
they won't fight on conscience.

1008
01:17:18,232 --> 01:17:21,827
Now, where would be if everybody decided to act

1009
01:17:21,936 --> 01:17:25,895
- according to their conscience?
- Keep it down, would you, Chief?

1010
01:17:42,123 --> 01:17:45,493
Hey. I've been watching you.

1011
01:17:46,661 --> 01:17:48,458
You seem trustworthy.

1012
01:17:50,264 --> 01:17:52,357
If something happens to me,

1013
01:17:56,437 --> 01:17:58,997
could you see that this gets to my wife?

1014
01:17:59,106 --> 01:18:03,634
He'd given me all of his pay.
Hadn't spent a dime of it.

1015
01:18:05,546 --> 01:18:08,811
I want my family to know I was thinking about them.

1016
01:18:13,587 --> 01:18:15,418
All hands on deck!

1017
01:18:17,925 --> 01:18:20,723
Get your asses up here, you lazy bastards!

1018
01:18:42,016 --> 01:18:44,211
The war had finally found us.

1019
01:18:46,921 --> 01:18:48,388
All stop!

1020
01:18:51,125 --> 01:18:53,116
Pleasant, man that light.

1021
01:19:01,001 --> 01:19:05,165
A transport carrying 1,300 men
had been split by a torpedo.

1022
01:19:07,575 --> 01:19:09,839
We were first to arrive at the scene.

1023
01:19:09,944 --> 01:19:13,505
- Cut the engines!
- All stop!

1024
01:19:18,652 --> 01:19:20,552
We were the only sound.

1025
01:19:34,502 --> 01:19:35,901
Fellas!

1026
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:46,938
Sub!

1027
01:19:51,752 --> 01:19:54,550
We sure as hell can't outrun them fuckers.

1028
01:19:56,290 --> 01:19:58,588
Battle stations!

1029
01:20:08,469 --> 01:20:09,458
Thank you, Chief.

1030
01:20:11,772 --> 01:20:12,864
What?

1031
01:20:25,853 --> 01:20:27,650
Is that the last one?

1032
01:21:49,050 --> 01:21:50,350
Captain!

1033
01:22:05,950 --> 01:22:08,550
They shot the hell out of my painting!

1034
01:22:09,850 --> 01:22:11,650
Give me your other hand.

1035
01:22:17,050 --> 01:22:18,050
You'll be all right, Captain.

1036
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:22,450
They got a nice spot in Heaven
waiting for you. Nice spot.

1037
01:22:24,050 --> 01:22:27,050
You can be as mad as a mad dog at the way things went.

1038
01:22:30,050 --> 01:22:33,750
You could swear, curse the Fates.

1039
01:22:36,050 --> 01:22:38,150
But when it comes to the end,

1040
01:22:40,350 --> 01:22:42,050
you have to let go.

1041
01:22:49,150 --> 01:22:50,350
Captain?

1042
01:23:11,150 --> 01:23:14,450
Thirteen hundred and twenty eight men died that day.

1043
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:20,050
I said my goodbyes to the Cherokee, Dennis Smith.

1044
01:23:20,950 --> 01:23:24,150
John Grimm, who was right, he was gonna die there.

1045
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:28,350
I sent Pleasant Curtis' wife his money.

1046
01:23:29,250 --> 01:23:32,350
I said goodbye to the twin, Vic Brody,

1047
01:23:32,450 --> 01:23:37,050
and to Mike Clark, captain of the tugboat Chelsea.

1048
01:23:39,550 --> 01:23:44,050
I said goodbye to all the other
men who had dreams of their own,

1049
01:23:44,150 --> 01:23:46,650
all the men who wanted to be insurance salesmen

1050
01:23:46,750 --> 01:23:49,750
or doctors or lawyers or Indian chiefs.

1051
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:52,550
This don't get fixed.

1052
01:23:54,650 --> 01:23:57,750
Out here, death didn't seem natural.

1053
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:17,950
I'd never seen a hummingbird that far out to sea.

1054
01:24:19,450 --> 01:24:21,050
Before or since.

1055
01:24:27,050 --> 01:24:33,050
And in May of 1945, when I was 26 years old,

1056
01:24:33,450 --> 01:24:34,550
I came home.

1057
01:24:35,450 --> 01:24:38,050
I'm ready! I'm ready!

1058
01:24:38,150 --> 01:24:39,550
I'm coming!

1059
01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:44,050
- I'm ready!
- All right, I'm coming, Miss Alfalina.

1060
01:24:44,150 --> 01:24:45,650
- Queenie?
- Yes?

1061
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:57,450
Sweet Jesus! Oh, you're home! Oh, Lord, you came back!

1062
01:24:58,350 --> 01:25:00,350
- Let me look at you.
- Who's that, Mama?

1063
01:25:00,450 --> 01:25:03,650
- Child, it's your brother, Benjamin.
- I didn't know he was my brother.

1064
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:05,450
There's a shitload of things you don't know, child.

1065
01:25:05,550 --> 01:25:06,750
Get on out there and finish sweeping.

1066
01:25:06,850 --> 01:25:08,950
Come here, wash your hands, help
me with the table. Go on, now.

1067
01:25:09,050 --> 01:25:12,950
Turn around. You look like you've been born again.

1068
01:25:13,050 --> 01:25:15,350
Younger than the springtime.

1069
01:25:15,450 --> 01:25:19,050
I think that preacher laid hands
on you gave you a second life.

1070
01:25:19,150 --> 01:25:22,850
I knew it that moment I saw you, you were special.

1071
01:25:22,950 --> 01:25:24,750
I tell you what, my knees are sore,

1072
01:25:24,950 --> 01:25:27,450
'cause I've been on them every night asking the Lord,

1073
01:25:27,550 --> 01:25:31,250
I said, "God, just bring him home safely."

1074
01:25:31,350 --> 01:25:33,850
Remember what I told you?

1075
01:25:33,950 --> 01:25:35,650
"You never know what's coming for you"?

1076
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:37,650
That's right. Sit down.

1077
01:25:39,050 --> 01:25:43,150
Well, you learn anything worth repeating?

1078
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:49,450
- I sure saw some things.
- Oh, you seen some pain.

1079
01:25:50,950 --> 01:25:53,750
- Some joy, too?
- Sure. Sure, I did.

1080
01:25:53,850 --> 01:25:57,950
Yeah, that's what I want to hear. Look at you.

1081
01:25:58,050 --> 01:26:01,550
- Where's Tizzy?
- Oh, baby.

1082
01:26:04,050 --> 01:26:07,950
Mr. Weathers died in his sleep one night last April.

1083
01:26:08,050 --> 01:26:11,450
- Mama, I'm so sorry.
- Don't you worry about that, baby.

1084
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:15,850
Yeah, well, it's only one or two of them left now.

1085
01:26:15,950 --> 01:26:17,450
They all just about new.

1086
01:26:17,550 --> 01:26:21,450
Guess they're waiting their
turn like everybody else, huh?

1087
01:26:21,550 --> 01:26:24,250
I'm so glad you're back home with me!

1088
01:26:24,350 --> 01:26:27,450
Now, we're gonna have to find you
a wife and a new job! That's right.

1089
01:26:27,550 --> 01:26:29,450
Come on in here, help me with this table.

1090
01:26:32,650 --> 01:26:34,250
Benjamin.

1091
01:26:34,350 --> 01:26:37,450
You're wasting your time, baby. She's stone deaf.

1092
01:26:37,550 --> 01:26:41,650
Oh, and you'll be staying in
what was Mrs. DeSeroux's old room.

1093
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:44,650
You're too big to be rooming with anybody else.

1094
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:51,350
It's a funny thing about coming home.

1095
01:26:52,050 --> 01:26:55,750
Looks the same, smells the same, feels the same.

1096
01:26:58,550 --> 01:27:02,350
Did I ever tell you I've been
struck by lightning seven times?

1097
01:27:04,050 --> 01:27:07,450
Once when I was sitting in my
truck, just minding my own business.

1098
01:27:13,350 --> 01:27:16,750
You realize what's changed is you.

1099
01:27:19,450 --> 01:27:23,450
And late one morning, not long after I'd been back...

1100
01:27:23,850 --> 01:27:25,150
Thank you.

1101
01:27:47,250 --> 01:27:48,350
Hey.

1102
01:27:52,950 --> 01:27:56,750
- Excuse me, is Queenie here?
- Daisy?

1103
01:28:00,550 --> 01:28:04,150
- It's me, Benjamin.
- Benjamin?

1104
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:09,850
Oh, my God!

1105
01:28:11,150 --> 01:28:15,050
Of course it's you! Benjamin!

1106
01:28:17,150 --> 01:28:20,050
How are you? It's been such a long time.

1107
01:28:20,150 --> 01:28:22,850
There's so much I want to know. When did you get back?

1108
01:28:22,950 --> 01:28:24,350
Well, I got back a few weeks ago.

1109
01:28:24,450 --> 01:28:28,450
I spoke to Queenie, she said you
were in the war, somewhere at sea.

1110
01:28:28,550 --> 01:28:32,350
- We were so, so worried about you.
- Oh, I'm okay.

1111
01:28:32,450 --> 01:28:36,250
Well, look at you. You're so lovely.

1112
01:28:38,050 --> 01:28:39,850
You stopped writing.

1113
01:28:41,950 --> 01:28:47,050
"When I had left, she was a girl.
And a woman had taken her place.

1114
01:28:47,450 --> 01:28:50,550
"She was the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen."

1115
01:28:50,650 --> 01:28:52,050
Beautiful.

1116
01:28:54,250 --> 01:28:56,050
"The most beautiful."

1117
01:28:57,850 --> 01:28:59,550
- You remember Grandma Fuller?
- Why, sure I do.

1118
01:28:59,650 --> 01:29:02,750
- She passed.
- I heard that. I'm sorry.

1119
01:29:02,850 --> 01:29:07,450
I just can't believe we're both here. Must be fate.

1120
01:29:07,550 --> 01:29:09,450
No, no, what do they call it?

1121
01:29:09,550 --> 01:29:10,950
Kismet.

1122
01:29:11,050 --> 01:29:12,950
Do you know about Edgar Cayce, the psychic?

1123
01:29:13,050 --> 01:29:14,050
I don't believe I...

1124
01:29:14,150 --> 01:29:17,050
He says that everything is predetermined,

1125
01:29:17,150 --> 01:29:20,550
but I like to think of it as fate.

1126
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:26,950
I'm not sure how it works, but I'm glad it happened.

1127
01:29:27,050 --> 01:29:30,650
Have you been to Manhattan? It's
right across the river from me.

1128
01:29:30,750 --> 01:29:32,950
Now, I can see the Empire State Building

1129
01:29:33,050 --> 01:29:34,750
if I stand on my bed.

1130
01:29:34,850 --> 01:29:36,850
What about you? Where have you been?

1131
01:29:36,950 --> 01:29:40,550
Tell me everything. Last time you
wrote, you said you'd been to Russia.

1132
01:29:40,650 --> 01:29:44,850
I've always wanted to go to
Russia. Is it as cold as they say?

1133
01:29:44,950 --> 01:29:47,750
- Twice as cold.
- My goodness.

1134
01:29:48,350 --> 01:29:52,950
We always said you were different.
But I think you really are.

1135
01:29:55,150 --> 01:29:58,650
You wrote that you met somebody. Did it work out?

1136
01:29:59,150 --> 01:30:00,850
It ran its course.

1137
01:30:02,150 --> 01:30:04,250
Hey, do you remember this?

1138
01:30:15,150 --> 01:30:17,850
"This is the picture of Old Man Kangaroo

1139
01:30:17,950 --> 01:30:20,050
"at 5:00 in the afternoon."

1140
01:30:21,850 --> 01:30:24,050
Would you like to have dinner?

1141
01:30:31,550 --> 01:30:34,450
Did I tell you that I danced for Balanchine?

1142
01:30:35,150 --> 01:30:39,650
Oh, he's a famous choreographer.
He said that I had perfect line.

1143
01:30:41,450 --> 01:30:45,950
You know, in a rehearsal once, a dancer fell.

1144
01:30:46,050 --> 01:30:48,850
And he just... He just put
it right into the production.

1145
01:30:48,950 --> 01:30:52,450
I mean, can you imagine that?
Like in a classical ballet?

1146
01:30:52,550 --> 01:30:55,750
You know, a dancer, intentionally falling.

1147
01:30:55,850 --> 01:30:59,550
There's a whole new word for
dance now. It's called "abstract."

1148
01:30:59,650 --> 01:31:00,950
No, he's not the only one, though.

1149
01:31:01,050 --> 01:31:04,950
There's Lincoln Kirstein and Lucia Chase, and oh, my...

1150
01:31:05,050 --> 01:31:07,550
Oh, there's Agnes de Mille.

1151
01:31:07,650 --> 01:31:09,750
She's just torn up all those conventions,

1152
01:31:09,850 --> 01:31:11,850
you know, all that straight-up-and-down stuff.

1153
01:31:11,950 --> 01:31:15,150
It's not about the formality of the dance,
it's about what the dancer's feeling.

1154
01:31:15,250 --> 01:31:17,950
As she told me about this big new world,

1155
01:31:18,050 --> 01:31:20,550
names that didn't mean a thing to me,

1156
01:31:20,650 --> 01:31:22,650
I didn't really hear very much of what she was saying.

1157
01:31:22,750 --> 01:31:25,050
It's new and it's modern and it's American.

1158
01:31:25,150 --> 01:31:28,250
They understand our vigor and our physicality.

1159
01:31:28,350 --> 01:31:30,550
Oh, my God. I've just been talking and talking.

1160
01:31:30,750 --> 01:31:35,150
No, no, I've enjoyed listening.
I didn't know you smoked.

1161
01:31:35,250 --> 01:31:36,750
I'm old enough.

1162
01:31:40,150 --> 01:31:42,650
I'm old enough for a lot of things.

1163
01:31:45,550 --> 01:31:48,050
In New York, we stay up all night,

1164
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:52,050
watch the sun come up over the warehouses.

1165
01:31:54,450 --> 01:31:56,750
There's always something to do.

1166
01:32:14,450 --> 01:32:16,550
I have to go back tomorrow.

1167
01:32:17,650 --> 01:32:19,850
- So soon.
- Wish I could stay.

1168
01:32:24,650 --> 01:32:27,750
Dancers don't need costumes or scenery anymore.

1169
01:32:27,850 --> 01:32:31,450
I can imagine dancing completely naked.

1170
01:32:32,750 --> 01:32:35,050
Have you read D.H. Lawrence?

1171
01:32:35,150 --> 01:32:37,250
- Well...
- His books were banned.

1172
01:32:37,450 --> 01:32:40,950
The words are like making love.

1173
01:33:25,450 --> 01:33:30,050
In our company, we have to trust each other.

1174
01:33:35,350 --> 01:33:39,050
Sex is a part of it.

1175
01:33:43,450 --> 01:33:46,350
You know, a lot of the dancers are lesbians.

1176
01:33:48,550 --> 01:33:51,550
There was one woman who wanted to sleep with me.

1177
01:33:58,950 --> 01:34:01,950
- Does that upset you?
- Which part?

1178
01:34:03,050 --> 01:34:05,450
Somebody wanting to sleep with me.

1179
01:34:05,950 --> 01:34:07,150
You're a desirable woman.

1180
01:34:07,250 --> 01:34:10,950
I would think most of them
would want to sleep with you.

1181
01:34:11,050 --> 01:34:13,150
Let's go back to the house.

1182
01:34:14,150 --> 01:34:16,550
Or we could get a room somewhere.

1183
01:34:19,550 --> 01:34:22,650
- We could lay down your jacket.
- I don't know, Daisy.

1184
01:34:22,850 --> 01:34:28,150
It's not that I wouldn't like to or
anything. I think I'll just disappoint you.

1185
01:34:29,050 --> 01:34:32,150
Oh, Benjamin, I've been with older men.

1186
01:34:32,950 --> 01:34:34,950
You're going back to New York in the morning.

1187
01:34:35,050 --> 01:34:37,350
You should be with your friends.

1188
01:34:38,350 --> 01:34:40,850
- You're only young once.
- Oh, I'm old enough.

1189
01:34:40,950 --> 01:34:43,550
Daisy, just not tonight, is all.

1190
01:34:57,150 --> 01:34:59,250
We could go hear some music.

1191
01:35:01,550 --> 01:35:04,250
Our lives are defined by opportunities.

1192
01:35:05,050 --> 01:35:07,050
Even the ones we miss.

1193
01:35:07,950 --> 01:35:11,550
You look so handsome and so distinguished.

1194
01:35:11,650 --> 01:35:13,850
They're saying the hurricane's
gonna miss us, blow right on by.

1195
01:35:13,950 --> 01:35:18,550
- Oh, that's great.
- I'll stay under the blankets with Mother.

1196
01:35:18,650 --> 01:35:22,750
She says nothing... Benjamin?

1197
01:35:24,650 --> 01:35:25,750
"Things were becoming different..."

1198
01:35:25,850 --> 01:35:26,950
for me.

1199
01:35:27,150 --> 01:35:30,650
My hair had very little gray and grew like weeds.

1200
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:34,550
My sense of smell was keener. My hearing, more acute.

1201
01:35:34,650 --> 01:35:37,350
I could walk further and faster.

1202
01:35:37,450 --> 01:35:43,150
While everybody else was aging,
I was getting younger, all alone.

1203
01:35:46,250 --> 01:35:47,450
Come in.

1204
01:35:48,850 --> 01:35:50,150
Benjamin.

1205
01:35:51,150 --> 01:35:54,350
- Do you remember me?
- Well, sure I do, Mr. Button.

1206
01:35:55,050 --> 01:35:58,650
- What happened to you?
- Darn foot. Got infected, so...

1207
01:36:00,350 --> 01:36:01,550
Welcome home, my friend.

1208
01:36:04,250 --> 01:36:07,350
I see you're still drinking your Sazerac with whiskey.

1209
01:36:07,450 --> 01:36:08,650
Creature of habit.

1210
01:36:08,750 --> 01:36:10,850
You still visiting the house on Bourbon Street?

1211
01:36:10,950 --> 01:36:12,750
Not for a long time.

1212
01:36:14,350 --> 01:36:16,450
Interesting times, though.

1213
01:36:16,550 --> 01:36:20,950
We went from making 40,000 to
nearly half a million buttons a day.

1214
01:36:21,050 --> 01:36:23,050
We employed 10 times the number of people.

1215
01:36:23,150 --> 01:36:25,650
We were operating around the clock.

1216
01:36:30,250 --> 01:36:31,550
Damn shame.

1217
01:36:32,750 --> 01:36:35,650
The war has been kind to the button industry.

1218
01:36:38,450 --> 01:36:39,750
You know,

1219
01:36:42,050 --> 01:36:45,350
I'm sick. I don't know how much longer I have.

1220
01:36:45,450 --> 01:36:48,250
- I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Button.
- No...

1221
01:36:49,650 --> 01:36:52,750
I don't have any people. I keep to myself.

1222
01:36:55,250 --> 01:36:58,250
I hope you don't mind, but, whenever possible,

1223
01:36:58,350 --> 01:37:00,350
I'd enjoy your company.

1224
01:37:00,450 --> 01:37:02,950
I'll certainly do what I can.

1225
01:37:06,250 --> 01:37:09,150
Benjamin, do you know anything about buttons?

1226
01:37:12,750 --> 01:37:17,450
Now, Button's Buttons has been
in our family for 124 years.

1227
01:37:18,050 --> 01:37:22,650
My grandfather was a tailor, and
he had a small shop in Richmond.

1228
01:37:22,750 --> 01:37:25,150
After the Civil War, he moved to New Orleans,

1229
01:37:25,250 --> 01:37:30,350
where my father had the wisdom to make our own buttons.

1230
01:37:30,450 --> 01:37:35,250
So, with his help, the tailor shop grew to this.

1231
01:37:36,050 --> 01:37:38,650
And today, I can't sew a stitch.

1232
01:37:42,850 --> 01:37:45,150
That's very, very interesting.

1233
01:37:48,650 --> 01:37:51,250
You sure have done well for yourself.

1234
01:37:52,150 --> 01:37:56,250
So, what can I do for you, Mr. Button?

1235
01:37:58,750 --> 01:38:01,750
Benjamin? You're my son.

1236
01:38:09,350 --> 01:38:11,950
I'm so sorry I never told you before.

1237
01:38:14,150 --> 01:38:17,550
You were born the night the Great War ended.

1238
01:38:19,450 --> 01:38:23,150
Your mother died giving birth to you.

1239
01:38:24,650 --> 01:38:26,850
I thought you were a monster.

1240
01:38:30,350 --> 01:38:33,650
I promised your mother I'd make sure you were safe.

1241
01:38:40,050 --> 01:38:42,550
I should never have abandoned you.

1242
01:38:46,650 --> 01:38:48,050
My mother?

1243
01:38:49,350 --> 01:38:52,350
At the summer house on Lake Pontchartrain.

1244
01:38:52,450 --> 01:38:55,850
When I was a boy, I'd love
to wake up before anyone else,

1245
01:38:55,950 --> 01:38:58,950
run down to that lake and watch the day begin.

1246
01:39:00,650 --> 01:39:03,250
It was as if I was the only one alive.

1247
01:39:05,050 --> 01:39:07,750
I fell in love the first time I saw her.

1248
01:39:08,350 --> 01:39:10,950
Your mother's name was Caroline Murphy.

1249
01:39:11,650 --> 01:39:14,450
She worked in your grandfather's kitchen.

1250
01:39:17,750 --> 01:39:19,450
She's from Dublin.

1251
01:39:20,150 --> 01:39:24,550
In 1903, Caroline and all her
brothers and sisters came to live here,

1252
01:39:24,650 --> 01:39:26,150
in New Orleans.

1253
01:39:28,250 --> 01:39:31,150
I'd find excuses to go down to that kitchen

1254
01:39:31,950 --> 01:39:34,050
just so I could look at her.

1255
01:39:40,450 --> 01:39:44,150
April 25th, 1918. Happiest day of my life.

1256
01:39:44,950 --> 01:39:47,150
The day I married your mother.

1257
01:39:48,950 --> 01:39:51,050
Why didn't you just tell me?

1258
01:39:51,950 --> 01:39:54,750
I plan on leaving everything I have to you.

1259
01:39:56,350 --> 01:39:58,750
- I have to go.
- Where?

1260
01:39:59,850 --> 01:40:01,150
Home.

1261
01:40:01,850 --> 01:40:03,250
And what does he think, anyway?

1262
01:40:03,350 --> 01:40:04,650
He thinks he can just show up

1263
01:40:04,750 --> 01:40:06,550
and everything's supposed to be fine and dandy.

1264
01:40:06,650 --> 01:40:09,250
Everybody's just supposed to be friends.

1265
01:40:09,350 --> 01:40:12,250
Well, he got another thing coming, that's for sure.

1266
01:40:12,350 --> 01:40:15,750
God be my witness, he got another thing coming.

1267
01:40:15,850 --> 01:40:18,950
He left us $18 that night you was found.

1268
01:40:19,050 --> 01:40:20,850
Eighteen ratty dollars

1269
01:40:20,950 --> 01:40:22,650
- and a filthy diaper.
- Good night, Mama.

1270
01:40:24,050 --> 01:40:25,250
Good night, baby.

1271
01:40:38,550 --> 01:40:42,850
Did I ever tell you I was
struck by lightning seven times?

1272
01:40:44,650 --> 01:40:46,750
Once, I was walking my dog down the road.

1273
01:40:51,750 --> 01:40:55,550
I'm blind in the one eye, can't hardly hear,

1274
01:40:56,850 --> 01:41:01,450
get twitches and shakes out of nowhere,
always losing my line of thought.

1275
01:41:03,050 --> 01:41:04,650
But you know what?

1276
01:41:05,450 --> 01:41:08,350
God keeps reminding me I'm lucky to be alive.

1277
01:41:14,150 --> 01:41:15,650
Storm's coming.

1278
01:41:43,650 --> 01:41:45,850
May I help you, sir? Up the stairs, first bedroom.

1279
01:41:45,950 --> 01:41:47,050
Thank you.

1280
01:42:02,850 --> 01:42:04,150
Wake up.

1281
01:42:06,650 --> 01:42:08,550
Let's get you dressed.

1282
01:42:35,950 --> 01:42:37,550
Now that's something.

1283
01:42:40,950 --> 01:42:42,250
Thank you.

1284
01:43:42,350 --> 01:43:46,350
You can be mad as a mad dog at the way things went.

1285
01:43:46,450 --> 01:43:48,850
You can swear and curse the Fates.

1286
01:43:50,450 --> 01:43:52,650
But when it comes to the end,

1287
01:43:53,950 --> 01:43:55,650
you have to let go.

1288
01:44:17,650 --> 01:44:20,250
Well, it sure is a beautiful service.

1289
01:44:22,150 --> 01:44:24,950
He'll be buried right next to your mother.

1290
01:44:26,350 --> 01:44:28,050
You're my mother.

1291
01:44:31,850 --> 01:44:33,050
My baby.

1292
01:44:37,650 --> 01:44:39,850
Now, I'd never seen New York.

1293
01:46:08,050 --> 01:46:11,350
- Excuse me, I'm a friend of Daisy's.
- Right this way.

1294
01:46:12,450 --> 01:46:17,750
- Daisy has company. Daisy! Daisy!
- Yes!

1295
01:46:18,150 --> 01:46:21,450
- We need the wardrobe.
- Is somebody looking for me?

1296
01:46:24,050 --> 01:46:26,250
- Benjamin.
- Hi.

1297
01:46:27,550 --> 01:46:31,350
- What are you doing here?
- Thought I'd come visit.

1298
01:46:31,450 --> 01:46:34,850
Spend some time with you, if I could.

1299
01:46:35,050 --> 01:46:40,850
Oh, well, I wish you would have
called. You took me by surprise.

1300
01:46:42,250 --> 01:46:46,350
- You can just throw them out.
- No. Thank you, they're lovely.

1301
01:46:47,050 --> 01:46:51,850
I couldn't take my eyes off of
you. I thought you were mesmerizing.

1302
01:46:53,850 --> 01:46:56,650
Thank you. That's very kind of you to say.

1303
01:47:01,950 --> 01:47:04,050
I better get changed. A group
of us are going to a party.

1304
01:47:04,150 --> 01:47:07,350
- Would you want to come?
- Someone told me about a restaurant

1305
01:47:07,550 --> 01:47:08,750
I thought you might enjoy.

1306
01:47:08,850 --> 01:47:11,350
I made a reservation, just in case.

1307
01:47:11,450 --> 01:47:14,450
Just, all the dancers go out after the show. You're...

1308
01:47:14,550 --> 01:47:18,350
You're welcome to come with
us. I'll get changed. All right?

1309
01:47:24,850 --> 01:47:26,950
She choreographs for the Ballets Russes.

1310
01:47:27,050 --> 01:47:28,350
She's divine.

1311
01:47:28,950 --> 01:47:30,850
You were breathtaking.

1312
01:47:36,550 --> 01:47:37,750
Sweetie.

1313
01:47:38,950 --> 01:47:41,850
This is David. He dances with the company.

1314
01:47:42,850 --> 01:47:44,850
- This is Benjamin.
- Who?

1315
01:47:44,950 --> 01:47:48,150
- I told you about him.
- Oh, yeah. How you doing?

1316
01:47:48,250 --> 01:47:51,750
- I'll go get you a drink.
- All right. Thanks.

1317
01:47:59,450 --> 01:48:02,650
So, you were a friend of her grandmother's?

1318
01:48:02,750 --> 01:48:04,650
Or something like that?

1319
01:48:05,750 --> 01:48:07,550
Something like that.

1320
01:48:07,850 --> 01:48:09,450
Hey, excuse me.

1321
01:48:31,750 --> 01:48:33,050
Come on.

1322
01:48:54,350 --> 01:48:55,450
Hey!

1323
01:48:56,450 --> 01:48:58,950
Now, I had no idea you were coming.

1324
01:48:59,950 --> 01:49:01,450
Lord, Benjamin.

1325
01:49:04,050 --> 01:49:07,950
What did you expect? What,
you want me to drop everything?

1326
01:49:08,050 --> 01:49:10,050
Now, this is my life.

1327
01:49:10,150 --> 01:49:12,550
Babe! You going downtown?

1328
01:49:17,550 --> 01:49:20,650
Come on. You'll have a good time.

1329
01:49:21,550 --> 01:49:22,950
There's lots of musicians, interesting people.

1330
01:49:23,150 --> 01:49:26,050
You don't have to do that. This is my fault.

1331
01:49:27,150 --> 01:49:28,550
I should have called.

1332
01:49:28,650 --> 01:49:31,450
I thought I'd come here

1333
01:49:31,550 --> 01:49:34,250
and sweep you off your feet or something.

1334
01:49:35,750 --> 01:49:40,250
- Daisy! Come on! Let's go.
- Be right there.

1335
01:49:42,050 --> 01:49:43,450
Seems nice.

1336
01:49:44,750 --> 01:49:46,350
Do you love him?

1337
01:49:49,550 --> 01:49:50,850
I think so.

1338
01:49:53,050 --> 01:49:54,650
I'm happy for you.

1339
01:49:56,650 --> 01:49:58,750
Maybe I'll see you at home.

1340
01:50:01,350 --> 01:50:02,450
Okay.

1341
01:50:04,550 --> 01:50:06,250
I enjoyed the show!

1342
01:50:13,850 --> 01:50:18,350
He came to tell me his father had died.

1343
01:50:20,150 --> 01:50:21,220
You couldn't have known.

1344
01:50:21,238 --> 01:50:26,050
I was 23. I... I just didn't care.

1345
01:50:28,650 --> 01:50:30,050
What did you do next?

1346
01:50:30,150 --> 01:50:37,050
Some photographs, I think, in the front of my bag.

1347
01:50:39,150 --> 01:50:43,250
I was as good a dancer as I was ever gonna be.

1348
01:50:45,150 --> 01:50:47,050
For five years, I...

1349
01:50:49,850 --> 01:50:51,650
I danced everywhere.

1350
01:50:53,050 --> 01:50:56,550
London, Vienna, Prague.

1351
01:50:57,150 --> 01:50:59,050
I've never seen these.

1352
01:51:02,450 --> 01:51:03,450
Mom.

1353
01:51:04,750 --> 01:51:07,450
You never talked about your dancing.

1354
01:51:07,550 --> 01:51:09,550
Well, I was the only American

1355
01:51:09,650 --> 01:51:14,650
to be invited to dance with the Bolshoi, sugar.

1356
01:51:16,450 --> 01:51:18,450
It was glorious.

1357
01:51:22,950 --> 01:51:26,650
But Benjamin was never far from my thoughts.

1358
01:51:29,850 --> 01:51:33,350
And I'd find myself saying...

1359
01:51:33,550 --> 01:51:35,250
Good night, Benjamin.

1360
01:51:37,350 --> 01:51:40,950
- "Good night, Daisy."
- He said that?

1361
01:51:43,150 --> 01:51:44,250
"Life wasn't all that complicated.

1362
01:51:45,150 --> 01:51:47,950
"If you want, you might say
I was looking for something."

1363
01:51:57,350 --> 01:52:00,350
Benjamin? Mrs. La Tourneau just passed.

1364
01:52:06,750 --> 01:52:10,450
- Letter for Mr. Benjamin Button?
- That'd be me.

1365
01:52:13,350 --> 01:52:14,650
Thank you.

1366
01:52:41,050 --> 01:52:42,950
Miss Daisy Fuller.

1367
01:52:43,050 --> 01:52:45,850
- Just a minute. Please have a seat.
- Sure.

1368
01:52:53,250 --> 01:52:57,650
Sometimes we're on a collision
course and we just don't know it.

1369
01:52:58,250 --> 01:53:02,750
Whether it's by accident or by design,
there's not a thing we can do about it.

1370
01:53:05,550 --> 01:53:08,650
A woman in Paris was on her way to go shopping.

1371
01:53:09,950 --> 01:53:13,750
But she had forgotten her coat, went back to get it.

1372
01:53:13,850 --> 01:53:16,050
When she had gotten her coat, the phone had rung.

1373
01:53:16,150 --> 01:53:19,150
So she had stopped to answer it
and talked for a couple of minutes.

1374
01:53:20,650 --> 01:53:22,450
While the woman was on the phone,

1375
01:53:22,550 --> 01:53:26,750
Daisy was rehearsing for a
performance at the Paris Opera House.

1376
01:53:26,850 --> 01:53:29,550
And while she was rehearsing,
the woman, off the phone now,

1377
01:53:29,650 --> 01:53:31,950
had gone outside to get a taxi.

1378
01:53:36,550 --> 01:53:38,850
Now, a taxi driver had dropped off a fare earlier,

1379
01:53:38,950 --> 01:53:41,650
and had stopped to get a cup of coffee.

1380
01:53:42,550 --> 01:53:45,250
And all the while, Daisy was rehearsing.

1381
01:53:48,850 --> 01:53:51,350
And this cab driver, who dropped off the earlier fare

1382
01:53:51,450 --> 01:53:53,350
and had stopped to get the cup of coffee,

1383
01:53:53,450 --> 01:53:55,150
he picked up the lady who was going shopping

1384
01:53:55,250 --> 01:53:57,950
and had missed getting the earlier cab.

1385
01:53:58,950 --> 01:54:01,350
The taxi had to stop for a man crossing the street,

1386
01:54:01,450 --> 01:54:04,250
who had left for work five
minutes later than he normally did

1387
01:54:04,350 --> 01:54:06,850
because he forgot to set his alarm.

1388
01:54:07,650 --> 01:54:10,950
While that man, late for work, was crossing the street,

1389
01:54:11,050 --> 01:54:14,450
Daisy had finished rehearsing and was taking a shower.

1390
01:54:14,950 --> 01:54:16,250
And while Daisy was showering,

1391
01:54:16,350 --> 01:54:20,050
the taxi was waiting outside a boutique
for the woman to pick up a package

1392
01:54:20,150 --> 01:54:21,250
which hadn't been wrapped yet,

1393
01:54:21,350 --> 01:54:23,150
because the girl who was supposed to wrap it

1394
01:54:23,250 --> 01:54:26,850
had broken up with her boyfriend
the night before and forgot.

1395
01:54:27,550 --> 01:54:30,750
When the package was wrapped, the
woman, who was back in the cab,

1396
01:54:30,850 --> 01:54:32,450
was blocked by a delivery truck.

1397
01:54:32,550 --> 01:54:35,250
All the while, Daisy was getting dressed.

1398
01:54:36,750 --> 01:54:40,150
The delivery truck pulled away,
and the taxi was able to move

1399
01:54:40,250 --> 01:54:42,350
while Daisy, the last to be dressed,

1400
01:54:42,450 --> 01:54:45,950
waited for one of her friends
who had broken a shoelace.

1401
01:54:46,450 --> 01:54:49,350
While the taxi was stopped,
waiting for a traffic light,

1402
01:54:49,450 --> 01:54:53,350
Daisy and her friend came out the back of the theater.

1403
01:54:53,450 --> 01:54:56,850
And if only one thing had happened differently,

1404
01:54:56,950 --> 01:54:59,050
if that shoelace hadn't broken

1405
01:54:59,150 --> 01:55:01,650
or that delivery truck had moved moments earlier

1406
01:55:01,750 --> 01:55:03,650
or that package had been wrapped and ready

1407
01:55:03,750 --> 01:55:06,450
because the girl hadn't broken up with her boyfriend,

1408
01:55:06,550 --> 01:55:10,250
or that man had set his alarm
and got up five minutes earlier

1409
01:55:10,350 --> 01:55:13,450
or that taxi driver hadn't stopped for a cup of coffee

1410
01:55:13,550 --> 01:55:17,550
or that woman had remembered her
coat and got into an earlier cab,

1411
01:55:18,150 --> 01:55:20,850
Daisy and her friend would have crossed the street

1412
01:55:20,950 --> 01:55:23,350
and the taxi would have driven by.

1413
01:55:34,450 --> 01:55:36,150
But, life being what it is,

1414
01:55:36,250 --> 01:55:39,250
a series of intersecting lives and incidents

1415
01:55:39,350 --> 01:55:41,150
out of anyone's control,

1416
01:55:42,050 --> 01:55:44,750
that taxi did not go by,

1417
01:55:44,850 --> 01:55:47,650
and that driver was momentarily distracted.

1418
01:55:48,650 --> 01:55:49,650
Daisy!

1419
01:55:49,850 --> 01:55:51,050
And that taxi hit Daisy.

1420
01:55:51,150 --> 01:55:52,850
Daisy! Help!

1421
01:55:56,050 --> 01:55:58,050
And her leg was crushed.

1422
01:56:05,450 --> 01:56:06,650
Daisy?

1423
01:56:10,950 --> 01:56:13,450
- Who told you?
- Your friend wired me.

1424
01:56:14,550 --> 01:56:18,550
Very kind of you to come all this
way to see that I was all right.

1425
01:56:20,150 --> 01:56:22,150
You'd do the same for me.

1426
01:56:24,050 --> 01:56:25,250
My God.

1427
01:56:27,450 --> 01:56:30,850
Look at you. You're perfect.

1428
01:56:33,750 --> 01:56:38,250
I wish you hadn't come here. I
don't want you to see me like this.

1429
01:56:44,650 --> 01:56:46,950
Her leg had been broken in five places.

1430
01:56:47,050 --> 01:56:50,150
And with therapy and time, she might walk again.

1431
01:56:51,750 --> 01:56:53,650
But she'd never dance.

1432
01:56:55,250 --> 01:56:57,650
I'm gonna take you home with me.

1433
01:56:57,750 --> 01:57:00,550
- I want to look after you.
- I'm not going back to New Orleans.

1434
01:57:00,650 --> 01:57:02,850
Then I'll stay here in Paris.

1435
01:57:03,450 --> 01:57:06,450
Don't you understand? I don't want your help.

1436
01:57:07,550 --> 01:57:11,850
I know I'm feeling sorry for myself,
but I don't want to be with you.

1437
01:57:11,950 --> 01:57:15,650
Tried to tell you that in New York. You don't listen.

1438
01:57:17,250 --> 01:57:19,150
You might change your mind.

1439
01:57:19,250 --> 01:57:22,250
We are not little children anymore, Benjamin.

1440
01:57:24,250 --> 01:57:27,450
Just stay out of my life.

1441
01:57:50,350 --> 01:57:53,550
I was awfully cruel.

1442
01:57:54,650 --> 01:58:00,050
He didn't understand. I couldn't
have him see me like that.

1443
01:58:02,750 --> 01:58:04,150
"I didn't leave right away.

1444
01:58:06,750 --> 01:58:10,050
"I stayed in Paris for a while to look out for her."

1445
01:58:13,750 --> 01:58:15,550
I never knew that.

1446
01:58:18,950 --> 01:58:23,050
Oh, darling, could you get the nurse?

1447
01:58:26,750 --> 01:58:31,750
I taught myself to walk again.

1448
01:58:34,850 --> 01:58:37,350
I took the train to Lourdes.

1449
01:58:38,750 --> 01:58:44,350
Let's take a look. That's
normal. Pulse rate is slowing.

1450
01:58:44,450 --> 01:58:46,450
She is gonna struggle to breathe.

1451
01:58:46,550 --> 01:58:48,750
- Will you be all right?
- Yeah.

1452
01:59:01,950 --> 01:59:07,850
All right, he says, "I went back home."
And then there's a lot of pages torn out.

1453
01:59:08,050 --> 01:59:11,750
"I listened to the sound of
the house." I read that already.

1454
01:59:12,650 --> 01:59:13,750
He...

1455
01:59:14,750 --> 01:59:17,950
He spilt something on it, so it's hard to read, Mom.

1456
01:59:19,150 --> 01:59:21,850
Something about sailing, does that make sense?

1457
01:59:22,650 --> 01:59:26,050
I learned to sail an old boat of
my father's from the lake house.

1458
01:59:35,250 --> 01:59:37,150
I can't lie.

1459
01:59:37,250 --> 01:59:40,050
I did enjoy the company of a woman or two.

1460
01:59:48,450 --> 01:59:49,950
Or maybe three.

1461
02:00:26,550 --> 02:00:30,750
Don't know why you bother, Sam,
just gonna be there again tomorrow.

1462
02:00:35,150 --> 02:00:36,250
Mama.

1463
02:00:41,150 --> 02:00:43,550
And in the spring of 1962,

1464
02:00:47,450 --> 02:00:48,950
she came back.

1465
02:01:08,350 --> 02:01:11,950
- You want to know where I've been?
- No.

1466
02:01:13,950 --> 02:01:18,850
How come you didn't write or
nothing? Just disappearing like that.

1467
02:01:18,950 --> 02:01:21,550
It was something I needed to do for myself.

1468
02:01:21,650 --> 02:01:25,350
Yeah, well, I never took you to be the selfish type.

1469
02:01:25,450 --> 02:01:27,950
I sure hope I'm not wrong.

1470
02:01:29,050 --> 02:01:31,150
I'm usually not wrong about people.

1471
02:01:31,250 --> 02:01:33,750
- Good night, Mama.
- Good night, baby.

1472
02:01:34,750 --> 02:01:36,350
Y'all have fun.

1473
02:01:39,150 --> 02:01:43,550
- You haven't said two words.
- I don't want to ruin it.

1474
02:02:13,750 --> 02:02:16,050
- Sleep with me?
- Absolutely.

1475
02:02:53,750 --> 02:02:56,150
I asked her to come away with me.

1476
02:02:58,450 --> 02:03:01,550
We sailed into the Gulf along the Florida Keys.

1477
02:03:42,850 --> 02:03:47,250
I am so glad we didn't find one another when I was 26.

1478
02:03:47,350 --> 02:03:51,650
- Why do you say that?
- I was so young.

1479
02:03:51,750 --> 02:03:53,550
And you were so old.

1480
02:03:54,250 --> 02:03:57,150
It happened when it was supposed to happen.

1481
02:03:57,250 --> 02:04:00,350
I will enjoy each and every moment I have with you.

1482
02:04:05,550 --> 02:04:08,050
I bet I can stay out here longer than you.

1483
02:04:08,150 --> 02:04:09,750
I bet you can't.

1484
02:04:12,550 --> 02:04:15,050
Barely a line or a crease.

1485
02:04:15,550 --> 02:04:18,650
Every day I have more wrinkles. It's not fair.

1486
02:04:20,350 --> 02:04:24,050
I love your wrinkles. Both of them.

1487
02:04:29,750 --> 02:04:32,050
What's it like growing younger?

1488
02:04:34,550 --> 02:04:39,150
I can't really say. I'm always looking out my own eyes.

1489
02:04:44,150 --> 02:04:47,950
Will you still love me when
my skin grows old and saggy?

1490
02:04:48,050 --> 02:04:52,550
Will you still love me when I
have acne? When I wet the bed?

1491
02:04:53,850 --> 02:04:56,750
When I'm afraid of what's under the stairs?

1492
02:05:04,150 --> 02:05:05,250
What?

1493
02:05:11,250 --> 02:05:15,250
- What are you thinking?
- Well, I was thinking how nothing lasts.

1494
02:05:17,650 --> 02:05:19,650
And what a shame that is.

1495
02:05:22,650 --> 02:05:24,250
Some things last.

1496
02:05:26,650 --> 02:05:30,750
- Good night, Daisy.
- Good night, Benjamin.

1497
02:05:47,250 --> 02:05:48,250
Mom?

1498
02:05:50,550 --> 02:05:54,550
- When did you meet Dad?
- Some time after that.

1499
02:05:57,750 --> 02:06:02,450
- Did you tell him about this Benjamin?
- He knew enough, darling.

1500
02:06:22,450 --> 02:06:23,550
Mama?

1501
02:06:30,750 --> 02:06:32,050
Queenie?

1502
02:06:35,250 --> 02:06:36,550
Hello?

1503
02:06:36,950 --> 02:06:40,550
Oh, hi, Mrs. Carter, it's Benjamin. Where is everybody?

1504
02:06:40,650 --> 02:06:45,850
Oh, Benjamin. Queenie died. I'm so sorry.

1505
02:07:14,550 --> 02:07:17,950
I'm so sorry for your loss. She was a great woman.

1506
02:07:18,050 --> 02:07:19,850
Our deepest condolences.

1507
02:07:25,050 --> 02:07:28,050
We buried her beside her beloved Mr. Weathers.

1508
02:07:35,050 --> 02:07:38,450
And so we might have memories of our own,

1509
02:07:38,650 --> 02:07:40,550
we sold my father's house on Esplanade.

1510
02:07:40,650 --> 02:07:43,250
It is a wonderful old place, darling.

1511
02:07:43,850 --> 02:07:46,750
I think we are going to be so happy here.

1512
02:07:46,850 --> 02:07:49,750
Oh, what a long family history you have.

1513
02:07:49,850 --> 02:07:51,850
They come with the house.

1514
02:07:54,450 --> 02:07:57,350
- Come on.
- You have to see the master suite.

1515
02:07:58,850 --> 02:08:01,050
We bought ourselves a duplex.

1516
02:08:03,150 --> 02:08:05,150
I loved that house.

1517
02:08:07,650 --> 02:08:09,550
It smelled like firewood.

1518
02:08:10,750 --> 02:08:13,950
Don't... Don't stop, darling.

1519
02:08:14,550 --> 02:08:17,450
"It was one of the happiest times of my life."

1520
02:08:17,550 --> 02:08:20,050
We didn't have a stick of furniture.

1521
02:08:20,850 --> 02:08:23,550
We would have picnics in the living room.

1522
02:08:27,050 --> 02:08:31,050
We ate when we felt like it.
Stayed up all night when we wanted.

1523
02:08:32,450 --> 02:08:34,450
We vowed never to fall into routine,

1524
02:08:34,550 --> 02:08:37,450
to go to bed or wake up at the same time.

1525
02:08:37,550 --> 02:08:39,550
We lived on that mattress.

1526
02:09:15,250 --> 02:09:18,750
Our neighbor, a Mrs. Van Dam, was a physical therapist.

1527
02:09:20,350 --> 02:09:23,050
We lived four blocks from a public pool.

1528
02:10:01,550 --> 02:10:04,250
You know, you might have got
a few more years out of it,

1529
02:10:04,350 --> 02:10:08,450
but you chose to do something so special and unique

1530
02:10:09,950 --> 02:10:13,650
that there was only a short
window of time you could do it.

1531
02:10:15,450 --> 02:10:17,950
So, even if nothing ever happened,

1532
02:10:18,050 --> 02:10:21,150
you'd still be right here where you are now.

1533
02:10:21,250 --> 02:10:23,450
I just don't like getting old.

1534
02:10:25,050 --> 02:10:27,550
They put too much chlorine in here.

1535
02:11:08,850 --> 02:11:12,750
I promise you I'll never lose
myself to self-pity again.

1536
02:11:17,050 --> 02:11:20,150
And I think right there and then

1537
02:11:20,250 --> 02:11:24,250
she realized none of us is perfect forever.

1538
02:11:28,150 --> 02:11:29,750
She found peace.

1539
02:11:31,650 --> 02:11:34,650
She opened a studio and taught
young girls how to dance.

1540
02:11:34,750 --> 02:11:37,750
And tendu.

1541
02:11:37,950 --> 02:11:42,950
Come back the other way. And
spot, spot, spot. Excellent.

1542
02:11:44,650 --> 02:11:47,150
- Good night, Miss Daisy.
- Good night.

1543
02:12:12,650 --> 02:12:15,250
You certainly are beautiful to watch.

1544
02:12:17,050 --> 02:12:19,450
Dancing's all about the line.

1545
02:12:21,750 --> 02:12:23,550
The line of your body.

1546
02:12:24,950 --> 02:12:29,250
Sooner or later, you lose that
line, and you never get it back.

1547
02:12:35,150 --> 02:12:41,150
I figure, you were born in 1918, 49 years ago.

1548
02:12:41,250 --> 02:12:42,750
I'm 43.

1549
02:12:44,950 --> 02:12:47,450
We are almost the same age.

1550
02:12:50,750 --> 02:12:54,950
- We're meeting in the middle.
- We finally caught up with each other.

1551
02:12:56,150 --> 02:12:57,250
Wait.

1552
02:12:58,650 --> 02:13:01,250
I want to remember us just as we are now.

1553
02:13:12,150 --> 02:13:13,650
I'm pregnant.

1554
02:13:31,350 --> 02:13:34,950
You know, I swear the nurse
slipped and said it was a boy.

1555
02:13:49,950 --> 02:13:51,950
But I think it's a girl.

1556
02:13:57,250 --> 02:14:00,850
- I know you're afraid.
- I'm not hiding it.

1557
02:14:00,950 --> 02:14:02,050
Okay.

1558
02:14:09,350 --> 02:14:11,950
- What's your worst fear?
- Baby born like me.

1559
02:14:12,050 --> 02:14:14,450
Then I will love it all the more.

1560
02:14:16,550 --> 02:14:21,450
Okay. How can I be a father when
I'm heading in the other direction?

1561
02:14:22,150 --> 02:14:25,450
It's not fair to a child. I
don't want to be anybody's burden.

1562
02:14:25,550 --> 02:14:28,350
Sugar, we all end up in diapers.

1563
02:14:29,850 --> 02:14:31,950
I am gonna make this work.

1564
02:14:34,550 --> 02:14:37,450
I want this, and I want it with you.

1565
02:14:37,550 --> 02:14:40,950
I want you to have everything you want, all of it.

1566
02:14:41,050 --> 02:14:44,250
I'm just not sure how to reconcile this.

1567
02:14:44,350 --> 02:14:46,450
Would you tell a blind man he couldn't have children?

1568
02:14:46,550 --> 02:14:48,150
Here you go.

1569
02:14:48,250 --> 02:14:51,650
You'll be a father for as long as you can.

1570
02:14:51,750 --> 02:14:54,550
I know the consequences. I've accepted that.

1571
02:14:54,650 --> 02:14:57,250
Loving you is worth everything to me.

1572
02:15:01,850 --> 02:15:03,450
I have to go pee.

1573
02:15:17,550 --> 02:15:19,750
The oldest woman to ever swim the English Channel

1574
02:15:19,850 --> 02:15:21,550
arrived here today in Calais...

1575
02:15:21,650 --> 02:15:24,150
- Keep it.
- having made the swim in 34 hours,

1576
02:15:24,250 --> 02:15:26,450
22 minutes and 14 seconds.

1577
02:15:26,550 --> 02:15:31,450
The 68-year-old Elizabeth Abbott
arrived at 5:38 Greenwich mean time,

1578
02:15:31,550 --> 02:15:33,250
exhausted but happy.

1579
02:15:33,350 --> 02:15:36,950
Miss Abbott, how would you sum
up, in words, this achievement?

1580
02:15:37,050 --> 02:15:38,550
I suppose...

1581
02:15:39,950 --> 02:15:41,750
Anything's possible.

1582
02:15:45,750 --> 02:15:46,950
- All right?
- Yes. Thank you.

1583
02:15:47,050 --> 02:15:47,950
- You ready?
- Thank you very much.

1584
02:15:48,050 --> 02:15:50,050
Thank you. Thank you all.

1585
02:15:50,150 --> 02:15:52,050
- Yeah.
- You're very kind.

1586
02:15:59,350 --> 02:16:03,250
In the spring, on a day like any other...

1587
02:16:03,950 --> 02:16:05,950
I'll be back in an hour!

1588
02:16:10,950 --> 02:16:12,150
Honey?

1589
02:16:14,250 --> 02:16:16,250
Go and call an ambulance!

1590
02:16:19,150 --> 02:16:20,850
The baby's coming.

1591
02:16:21,650 --> 02:16:22,750
Operator, I need an ambulance.

1592
02:16:22,850 --> 02:16:25,250
- The baby's coming!
- 2714 Napoleon.

1593
02:16:32,550 --> 02:16:35,150
There you go. Keep breathing.

1594
02:16:36,150 --> 02:16:38,450
Deep breaths. Push.

1595
02:16:48,350 --> 02:16:49,750
There we go.

1596
02:17:06,250 --> 02:17:09,550
Everyone's fine. She's a perfectly healthy baby girl.

1597
02:17:16,450 --> 02:17:17,650
Honey?

1598
02:17:19,650 --> 02:17:23,250
She gave birth to a five pound, four ounce baby girl.

1599
02:17:39,450 --> 02:17:41,350
Did you count the toes?

1600
02:17:45,650 --> 02:17:47,150
She's perfect.

1601
02:17:47,650 --> 02:17:50,850
"And we named her for my mother, Caroline."

1602
02:17:54,650 --> 02:17:56,750
This Benjamin was my father?

1603
02:17:58,250 --> 02:18:00,450
And this is how you tell me?

1604
02:18:06,050 --> 02:18:07,350
Excuse me.

1605
02:18:17,850 --> 02:18:20,650
because all the ingredients
are there for a major storm,

1606
02:18:20,750 --> 02:18:23,250
possibly even up to a Category 5.

1607
02:18:30,050 --> 02:18:33,650
Hey, I know it's hard. You can't smoke in here.

1608
02:18:36,950 --> 02:18:39,250
Nobody can tell you exactly where it's gonna hit,

1609
02:18:39,350 --> 02:18:41,150
but we have to go with the guidance that we have,

1610
02:18:41,250 --> 02:18:44,950
incorporate that information
and then pass it along to you.

1611
02:18:51,850 --> 02:18:56,650
"You grew as the doctor had
promised, normal and healthy."

1612
02:19:05,350 --> 02:19:08,450
You're gonna have to find a real father for her.

1613
02:19:11,650 --> 02:19:13,350
What are you talking about?

1614
02:19:13,450 --> 02:19:16,750
She's gonna need someone to grow old with.

1615
02:19:16,850 --> 02:19:19,650
She'll learn to accept whatever happens. She loves you.

1616
02:19:19,850 --> 02:19:22,550
Honey, she needs a father, not a playmate.

1617
02:19:26,650 --> 02:19:27,950
- Is it me?
- Of course not.

1618
02:19:28,050 --> 02:19:30,050
- Is my age beginning to bother you?
- Of course not.

1619
02:19:30,150 --> 02:19:34,150
- Is that what you're telling me?
- You can't raise the both of us.

1620
02:19:42,850 --> 02:19:47,750
It was your first birthday. We had a party for you.

1621
02:19:48,450 --> 02:19:50,350
The house was filled with children.

1622
02:19:50,450 --> 02:19:52,350
- How are you?
- Hey, man.

1623
02:19:52,450 --> 02:19:56,050
Before you turn around, they'll
be in high school, dating.

1624
02:20:28,550 --> 02:20:32,550
I sold the summer house on Lake Pontchartrain,

1625
02:20:32,650 --> 02:20:35,350
I sold Button's Buttons,

1626
02:20:35,450 --> 02:20:39,950
I sold my father's sailboat, put
it all into a savings account.

1627
02:20:42,250 --> 02:20:45,450
And so that you and your mother might have a life,

1628
02:20:46,650 --> 02:20:50,550
I left, before you could ever remember me.

1629
02:21:40,350 --> 02:21:42,450
"I left with just the clothes on my back."

1630
02:21:43,850 --> 02:21:48,550
I don't want to read this now.
Can you just tell me where he went?

1631
02:21:49,950 --> 02:21:52,250
I don't really know.

1632
02:22:03,450 --> 02:22:08,450
It's for me. 1970. I was two. "Happy Birthday."

1633
02:22:11,250 --> 02:22:14,050
"I wish I could have kissed you good night."

1634
02:22:19,150 --> 02:22:20,950
They're all for me.

1635
02:22:21,950 --> 02:22:26,950
Five. "I wish I could have taken
you to your first day of school."

1636
02:22:31,450 --> 02:22:37,250
Six. "I wish I could have been
there to teach you to play piano."

1637
02:22:40,750 --> 02:22:43,750
1981, 13.

1638
02:22:43,850 --> 02:22:47,150
"I wish I could have told you not to chase some boy.

1639
02:22:48,450 --> 02:22:52,050
"I wish I could have held you
when you had a broken heart.

1640
02:22:53,550 --> 02:22:59,350
"I wish I could have been your father.
Nothing I ever did will replace that."

1641
02:23:06,850 --> 02:23:09,350
I guess he went to India.

1642
02:23:09,450 --> 02:23:11,950
"For what it's worth, it's never too late,

1643
02:23:12,050 --> 02:23:13,850
- "or, in my case, too early..."
- or, in my case, too early,

1644
02:23:15,150 --> 02:23:17,050
to be whoever you want to be.

1645
02:23:21,150 --> 02:23:23,850
There's no time limit. Start whenever you want.

1646
02:23:26,750 --> 02:23:31,150
You can change or stay the same.
There are no rules to this thing.

1647
02:23:33,750 --> 02:23:37,250
We can make the best or the worst of it.

1648
02:23:37,350 --> 02:23:39,650
And I hope you make the best of it.

1649
02:23:42,750 --> 02:23:45,450
I hope you see things that startle you.

1650
02:23:47,650 --> 02:23:51,150
I hope you feel things you never felt before.

1651
02:23:53,650 --> 02:23:57,050
I hope you meet people with a different point of view.

1652
02:23:58,250 --> 02:24:00,950
I hope you live a life you're proud of.

1653
02:24:03,950 --> 02:24:09,050
And if you find that you're
not, I hope you have the strength

1654
02:24:09,150 --> 02:24:12,350
- to start all over again.
- "start all over again."

1655
02:24:13,850 --> 02:24:17,550
He had been gone a long time.

1656
02:24:19,350 --> 02:24:21,450
I'll see you next Thursday.

1657
02:24:24,450 --> 02:24:27,850
- Good night, Miss Daisy.
- Oh, good night, sweetheart.

1658
02:24:45,650 --> 02:24:47,650
I'm sorry, we're closing.

1659
02:24:50,650 --> 02:24:52,150
Can I help you?

1660
02:24:53,750 --> 02:24:56,150
Are you here to pick somebody up?

1661
02:25:06,550 --> 02:25:08,450
Why did you come back?

1662
02:25:10,050 --> 02:25:11,250
Mom?

1663
02:25:12,350 --> 02:25:13,450
Mom?

1664
02:25:14,650 --> 02:25:16,150
You ready yet?

1665
02:25:19,150 --> 02:25:20,250
Mom, what's wrong?

1666
02:25:20,350 --> 02:25:23,950
I was just hearing a very sad
story about a mutual friend

1667
02:25:24,050 --> 02:25:26,750
who I hadn't seen for a very long time.

1668
02:25:28,050 --> 02:25:30,750
Caroline, this is Benjamin.

1669
02:25:30,850 --> 02:25:33,550
You knew him when you were just a baby.

1670
02:25:36,050 --> 02:25:37,250
- Hi.
- Hi.

1671
02:25:39,150 --> 02:25:41,050
Hey.

1672
02:25:43,050 --> 02:25:47,850
- Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were done.
- Oh, this is a friend of my family's.

1673
02:25:47,950 --> 02:25:52,950
Benjamin Button, this is my husband, Robert.

1674
02:25:53,050 --> 02:25:55,450
- How do you do?
- A pleasure.

1675
02:26:03,550 --> 02:26:06,550
Well, it was very nice to meet you.

1676
02:26:06,650 --> 02:26:08,450
- We'll be in the car, darling.
- All right.

1677
02:26:08,550 --> 02:26:09,750
Bye.

1678
02:26:10,450 --> 02:26:12,250
I'm just locking up.

1679
02:26:16,950 --> 02:26:18,050
Wow.

1680
02:26:20,550 --> 02:26:23,450
She's beautiful. Like her mother.

1681
02:26:25,050 --> 02:26:27,550
- Does she dance?
- Not very well.

1682
02:26:27,650 --> 02:26:29,550
I guess that'd be from my side of things.

1683
02:26:29,650 --> 02:26:31,650
She's a dear, sweet girl.

1684
02:26:32,850 --> 02:26:37,150
She seems a little lost. But then, who isn't at 12?

1685
02:26:37,350 --> 02:26:41,650
A lot of her reminds me of you.

1686
02:26:42,550 --> 02:26:46,450
My husband, he's a widower, or was... was a widower.

1687
02:26:46,850 --> 02:26:50,750
He's an incredibly kind, just bright, adventurous man.

1688
02:26:53,950 --> 02:26:56,650
- He's been a terrific father.
- Good.

1689
02:27:01,350 --> 02:27:05,250
- You are so much younger.
- Only on the outside.

1690
02:27:07,350 --> 02:27:08,850
You were right.

1691
02:27:10,650 --> 02:27:14,050
I couldn't have been raising both of you.

1692
02:27:14,150 --> 02:27:15,850
I'm not that strong.

1693
02:27:20,050 --> 02:27:22,150
So, where are you staying?

1694
02:27:24,750 --> 02:27:25,750
What are you gonna do?

1695
02:27:25,850 --> 02:27:29,650
I'm staying at the Pontchartrain Hotel on the Avenue.

1696
02:27:29,750 --> 02:27:33,350
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1697
02:27:33,450 --> 02:27:34,550
But...

1698
02:27:41,150 --> 02:27:42,750
They're waiting.

1699
02:28:24,850 --> 02:28:28,150
I remember that. That was him?

1700
02:28:30,850 --> 02:28:31,950
The hurricane has changed directions.

1701
02:28:32,050 --> 02:28:33,950
It's going to make landfall sometime soon.

1702
02:28:34,050 --> 02:28:35,750
- Am I supposed to do something?
- Arrangements are being made

1703
02:28:35,850 --> 02:28:37,050
to move people, but it's up to you.

1704
02:28:37,150 --> 02:28:39,050
No. No, we're... we're staying.

1705
02:28:39,150 --> 02:28:41,750
I'll let you know if anything changes.

1706
02:28:43,850 --> 02:28:48,150
"That night, while I was sitting
and wondering why I came back at all,

1707
02:28:48,250 --> 02:28:50,650
"there was a knock at the door."

1708
02:28:54,250 --> 02:28:55,450
Come in.

1709
02:29:09,750 --> 02:29:11,450
Are you all right?

1710
02:29:14,550 --> 02:29:18,650
I'm sorry, I don't know what I'm doing here.

1711
02:29:27,750 --> 02:29:29,150
Nothing lasts.

1712
02:29:32,650 --> 02:29:35,050
I have never stopped loving you.

1713
02:29:41,050 --> 02:29:43,750
Oh, but, Benjamin, I'm an old woman now.

1714
02:29:54,350 --> 02:29:56,550
Some things you never forget.

1715
02:30:16,850 --> 02:30:17,950
so few people even know

1716
02:30:18,050 --> 02:30:19,750
that you were ever in jail in the first place.

1717
02:30:19,850 --> 02:30:22,050
I'll tell you, I am sick about it, too,

1718
02:30:22,150 --> 02:30:24,650
because, please, if they're not gonna give you an award

1719
02:30:24,750 --> 02:30:26,850
like "Man of the Year," at least what they could do

1720
02:30:26,950 --> 02:30:29,650
is stop having you listed as an ex-convict

1721
02:30:29,750 --> 02:30:32,250
which I think is, again, so unfair.

1722
02:30:45,050 --> 02:30:46,850
Good night, Benjamin.

1723
02:30:48,350 --> 02:30:50,050
Good night, Daisy.

1724
02:30:53,250 --> 02:30:57,450
And as I knew I would, I watched her go.

1725
02:31:00,250 --> 02:31:02,450
That's the last thing he wrote.

1726
02:31:03,650 --> 02:31:08,250
Sometime after your father passed,

1727
02:31:08,350 --> 02:31:11,150
there was a call.

1728
02:31:14,250 --> 02:31:15,450
Hello.

1729
02:31:16,550 --> 02:31:18,050
Yes, speaking.

1730
02:31:21,350 --> 02:31:23,850
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

1731
02:31:33,750 --> 02:31:35,550
It's the corner house.

1732
02:31:57,750 --> 02:31:59,150
Come on in.

1733
02:32:04,750 --> 02:32:06,750
- I'm Daisy Fuller.
- I'm David Hernandez,

1734
02:32:06,850 --> 02:32:10,550
with the Orleans Parish Department
of Child Welfare Services.

1735
02:32:10,650 --> 02:32:13,250
He was living in a condemned building.

1736
02:32:15,150 --> 02:32:17,450
The police found this with him.

1737
02:32:17,550 --> 02:32:20,450
This address. It's got your name in it a lot.

1738
02:32:21,650 --> 02:32:24,250
He's in very poor health. He was taken to the hospital.

1739
02:32:24,350 --> 02:32:28,450
He doesn't seem to know who or
where he is. He's very confused.

1740
02:32:28,550 --> 02:32:32,050
I was telling Mr. Hernandez that Benjamin is one of us.

1741
02:32:32,150 --> 02:32:36,050
If he needs a place to stay,
it's all right, he can stay here.

1742
02:33:05,450 --> 02:33:06,750
Benjamin?

1743
02:33:10,650 --> 02:33:12,450
You play beautifully.

1744
02:33:15,950 --> 02:33:17,750
He doesn't seem to like to be touched.

1745
02:33:17,850 --> 02:33:19,550
He goes in and out of states of recognition.

1746
02:33:19,650 --> 02:33:21,250
The doctors say, if they didn't know any better,

1747
02:33:21,350 --> 02:33:23,850
he has the beginnings of dementia.

1748
02:33:25,650 --> 02:33:27,350
Do you remember me?

1749
02:33:30,550 --> 02:33:31,850
I'm Daisy.

1750
02:33:34,450 --> 02:33:35,950
I'm Benjamin.

1751
02:33:41,650 --> 02:33:44,250
It's nice to meet you, Benjamin.

1752
02:33:45,950 --> 02:33:51,350
Would you mind if I sit with you?
I would love to hear you play.

1753
02:33:55,250 --> 02:33:56,750
Do I know you?

1754
02:34:01,750 --> 02:34:03,350
- I want some breakfast.
- And every day,

1755
02:34:03,450 --> 02:34:07,450
I would stop by to make sure that he was comfortable.

1756
02:34:07,550 --> 02:34:10,150
- No, I didn't.
- You just finished eating.

1757
02:34:10,250 --> 02:34:12,550
Don't think I don't know what you're doing!

1758
02:34:12,650 --> 02:34:15,450
You're all fucking liars!

1759
02:34:15,550 --> 02:34:18,450
He doesn't believe he just had his breakfast.

1760
02:34:19,750 --> 02:34:23,350
Now, why don't we see

1761
02:34:23,550 --> 02:34:26,850
if we can't find something else for you to do?

1762
02:34:27,050 --> 02:34:30,250
I have a feeling there's a
lot of things I can't remember.

1763
02:34:30,350 --> 02:34:32,250
Well, like what, sugar?

1764
02:34:33,450 --> 02:34:37,450
It's like there's this whole life I had,

1765
02:34:38,950 --> 02:34:41,350
and I can't remember what it was.

1766
02:34:44,150 --> 02:34:45,450
It's okay.

1767
02:34:47,550 --> 02:34:49,050
It's okay to forget things.

1768
02:34:49,250 --> 02:34:54,850
Many times, he would simply forget who or where he was.

1769
02:34:55,250 --> 02:34:56,850
There he is, he's up there on the roof.

1770
02:34:56,950 --> 02:34:58,650
It wasn't easy.

1771
02:34:58,750 --> 02:35:01,050
- Benjamin!
- I can see everything!

1772
02:35:01,150 --> 02:35:02,850
- I can see the big river!
- That's right,

1773
02:35:02,950 --> 02:35:04,750
you can see everything, sweetheart.

1774
02:35:04,850 --> 02:35:06,850
I can see the graveyard where Mama's buried,

1775
02:35:06,950 --> 02:35:10,250
- and all those other people.
- I want you to come down!

1776
02:35:10,350 --> 02:35:14,150
- What if I could fly?
- I knew a man who could fly.

1777
02:35:15,150 --> 02:35:18,050
You come down and I'll tell you all about him.

1778
02:35:21,650 --> 02:35:23,250
Somebody go up there.

1779
02:35:29,850 --> 02:35:32,850
He was five when I moved in.

1780
02:35:32,950 --> 02:35:37,350
Nearly the same age I was when I had met him.

1781
02:35:43,450 --> 02:35:47,350
"This is the picture of Old Man Kangaroo

1782
02:35:47,450 --> 02:35:49,850
"at 5:00 in the afternoon

1783
02:35:49,950 --> 02:35:53,450
"when he had got his beautiful hind legs."

1784
02:35:54,650 --> 02:35:55,950
The days passed.

1785
02:35:56,050 --> 02:36:00,350
And I watched as he forgot how to walk

1786
02:36:05,550 --> 02:36:08,050
- and how to talk.
- What's my name?

1787
02:36:08,450 --> 02:36:09,850
I'm Daisy.

1788
02:36:10,950 --> 02:36:12,750
Can you say "Daisy"?

1789
02:36:14,350 --> 02:36:19,550
In 2002, they put up a new clock in that train station.

1790
02:36:26,450 --> 02:36:30,150
And in the spring of 2003,

1791
02:36:34,550 --> 02:36:36,250
he looked at me

1792
02:36:38,750 --> 02:36:43,850
and I knew that he knew who I was.

1793
02:36:47,350 --> 02:36:53,150
And then he closed his eyes as if to go to sleep.

1794
02:37:25,750 --> 02:37:29,850
- I wish I'd known him.
- Now you do.

1795
02:37:34,350 --> 02:37:38,150
Mom, I think I should go see what's going on.

1796
02:37:45,250 --> 02:37:47,250
Good night, Benjamin.

1797
02:38:17,350 --> 02:38:20,250
Some people are born to sit by a river.

1798
02:38:21,750 --> 02:38:23,650
Some get struck by lightning.

1799
02:38:25,550 --> 02:38:27,650
Some have an ear for music.

1800
02:38:29,250 --> 02:38:30,950
Some are artists.

1801
02:38:32,250 --> 02:38:33,550
Some swim.

1802
02:38:35,050 --> 02:38:36,650
Some know buttons.

1803
02:38:38,450 --> 02:38:39,850
Some know Shakespeare.

1804
02:38:40,950 --> 02:38:42,750
Some are mothers.

1805
02:38:44,750 --> 02:38:47,750
And some people dance.
