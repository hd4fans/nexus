1
00:00:14,203 --> 00:00:16,501
Whoo!

2
00:00:42,097 --> 00:00:47,467
You know, showboating like that
just makes you look desperate.

3
00:00:47,503 --> 00:00:51,269
Yeah, "Look at me. I can flip my ski."
Pathetic.

4
00:00:51,307 --> 00:00:54,401
- Yeah.
- Daniel, that was awesome!

5
00:00:55,444 --> 00:00:57,708
Nicole.

6
00:01:01,483 --> 00:01:03,644
Hey, Daniel, Nicole left, huh?

7
00:01:03,686 --> 00:01:06,814
Should've let me talk to her.

8
00:01:12,628 --> 00:01:14,493
Whoo-hoo!

9
00:01:21,603 --> 00:01:23,093
I love it out here.

10
00:01:26,642 --> 00:01:30,078
The Big Dipper.
It's my favorite.

11
00:01:32,047 --> 00:01:33,742
- Do you know that one?
- No.

12
00:01:33,816 --> 00:01:36,546
I got a D in Astronomy.

13
00:01:40,656 --> 00:01:43,557
So, I never see you with anyone.

14
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:47,026
Do you have a girlfriend
out of town or something?

15
00:01:54,002 --> 00:01:56,095
Daniel? Daniel?

16
00:02:02,845 --> 00:02:06,042
I want you to feel this!

17
00:02:07,383 --> 00:02:10,784
This is what's coming for you.

18
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:15,115
Daniel, are you OK?

19
00:02:17,326 --> 00:02:18,918
Oh, my God.

20
00:02:23,732 --> 00:02:26,929
He's a freak.
He's some kind of freak.

21
00:03:12,714 --> 00:03:13,942
Number Three's dead.

22
00:03:15,517 --> 00:03:17,951
You all right?

23
00:03:18,987 --> 00:03:21,820
- Yeah.
- Anyone else see what happened?

24
00:04:02,464 --> 00:04:06,366
I told you not to keep this crap.
It just slows us down.

25
00:04:33,228 --> 00:04:34,957
All right, let's go.

26
00:04:42,471 --> 00:04:43,938
Daniel.

27
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:54,879
<i>This is the part
I hate the most, the running.</i>

28
00:04:54,917 --> 00:04:58,182
<i>But it's the only thing
in my life that's real.</i>

29
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,051
<i>The rest is a lie.</i>

30
00:05:00,088 --> 00:05:02,283
<i>Even Henri.</i>

31
00:05:02,357 --> 00:05:04,257
<i>People think he's my father.</i>

32
00:05:04,293 --> 00:05:05,920
<i>He's not.</i>

33
00:05:05,961 --> 00:05:10,523
<i>He's a warrior from my planet,
assigned to keep me alive.</i>

34
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,063
<i>I don't remember my father.</i>

35
00:05:14,102 --> 00:05:17,265
<i>All he left for me
was some kind of box.</i>

36
00:05:17,306 --> 00:05:20,070
<i>Henri says he'll pass it on to me
when the time is right.</i>

37
00:05:22,778 --> 00:05:25,872
<i>I got my first scar
when I was nine years old,</i>

38
00:05:25,914 --> 00:05:28,439
<i>near the border of Mexico.</i>

39
00:05:28,517 --> 00:05:31,281
<i>It woke me from my sleep.</i>

40
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,347
<i>It was the first sign that the
Mogadorians had found us here on Earth.</i>

41
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:39,126
<i>The second scar
came when I was 12.</i>

42
00:05:39,194 --> 00:05:42,493
<i>I was in Colorado,
in the middle of a spelling bee.</i>

43
00:05:43,465 --> 00:05:46,696
<i>As soon as I felt it,
I knew Number Two was dead.</i>

44
00:05:47,936 --> 00:05:50,700
<i>Last night, I got my third scar.</i>

45
00:05:53,442 --> 00:05:58,311
<i>I was just a kid when the Mogadorians
invaded my planet, Lorien.</i>

46
00:05:58,347 --> 00:06:00,815
<i>Nine of us children escaped.</i>

47
00:06:00,882 --> 00:06:05,319
<i>We were gifted, meant to protect
our people when we grew up.</i>

48
00:06:05,354 --> 00:06:09,051
<i>We never got the chance.
Everyone was killed.</i>

49
00:06:10,292 --> 00:06:13,159
<i>We are the last of our kind.</i>

50
00:06:13,228 --> 00:06:17,460
<i>Three of us are gone. Dead.</i>

51
00:06:17,499 --> 00:06:20,730
<i>They are hunting us down,
one by one, in order.</i>

52
00:06:22,571 --> 00:06:24,334
<i>I know I'm next.</i>

53
00:06:26,108 --> 00:06:27,507
<i>I am Number Four.</i>

54
00:06:27,576 --> 00:06:28,873
All right, well, so...

55
00:06:28,944 --> 00:06:31,845
Daniel won't be in school
the rest of the semester.

56
00:06:31,913 --> 00:06:34,381
OK. You, too.

57
00:06:36,385 --> 00:06:37,750
Your new ID.

58
00:06:38,587 --> 00:06:43,024
And this time, you stay out of sight,
huh? No school, no teams, nothing.

59
00:06:43,058 --> 00:06:45,049
John Smith. Very original.

60
00:06:45,127 --> 00:06:48,290
I don't want to be original.
I want to be invisible.

61
00:06:52,134 --> 00:06:54,295
This time was different.

62
00:06:54,336 --> 00:06:56,327
I didn't just get a scar.

63
00:06:56,371 --> 00:06:58,965
I, uh... I saw Number Three.

64
00:07:01,043 --> 00:07:04,706
I felt the knife, I felt him die.
I could tell we all did.

65
00:07:05,947 --> 00:07:09,314
- The others.
- We should get moving.

66
00:07:09,351 --> 00:07:12,013
Mogadorians could've
already picked up our scent.

67
00:07:13,321 --> 00:07:17,121
We're going to Paradise.
I have business to take care of.

68
00:08:25,827 --> 00:08:26,953
It's Bernie Kosar.

69
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,397
Played football.

70
00:08:34,102 --> 00:08:38,266
- Yeah, he played for Cleveland.
- Hm. Good to know.

71
00:08:38,306 --> 00:08:41,070
- Next time, I get to pick the place.
- Yeah.

72
00:09:12,874 --> 00:09:15,536
That's all of it.
I'm going to bed.

73
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:19,205
Ooh. Hang on.
I need a new picture.

74
00:09:20,515 --> 00:09:23,006
We have to wipe out anything
that hits the Internet.

75
00:09:23,084 --> 00:09:26,383
Say "Paradise."

76
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,484
Oh, shit.

77
00:09:33,528 --> 00:09:35,723
This is why
I need you to be invisible.

78
00:10:07,262 --> 00:10:08,286
Get back inside.

79
00:10:10,232 --> 00:10:11,597
John.

80
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:15,193
Come on. Come back inside.

81
00:10:24,746 --> 00:10:27,909
Little small for a Mogadorian,
don't you think?

82
00:10:30,285 --> 00:10:32,116
I'm sure he belongs to someone.

83
00:10:32,187 --> 00:10:35,281
He doesn't
have any collar or tags.

84
00:10:35,357 --> 00:10:37,917
Hm. Somebody, somewhere,
must miss you, huh?

85
00:10:40,929 --> 00:10:42,328
Come on.

86
00:10:42,397 --> 00:10:45,093
Another pair of eyes
and ears watching the house?

87
00:10:45,834 --> 00:10:49,133
- I'm gonna need somebody to talk to.
- Talk to me.

88
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:53,439
Yeah, keep the dog.

89
00:10:53,508 --> 00:10:54,907
What are you gonna call him?

90
00:10:56,311 --> 00:10:59,246
How about Bernie Kosar?

91
00:12:36,478 --> 00:12:38,207
What are you doing up?

92
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,871
I changed my mind.

93
00:12:39,948 --> 00:12:41,779
About what?

94
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,910
Look, uh, as much fun
as you are to be around,

95
00:12:44,953 --> 00:12:48,013
I can't be a prisoner.
Uh, I have to go to school.

96
00:12:48,056 --> 00:12:50,081
- No. No way, too risky.
- Come on.

97
00:12:50,158 --> 00:12:52,683
Number Three was completely
off the grid and the Mogs got him.

98
00:12:52,727 --> 00:12:54,251
- Didn't save him.
- Mm-mm.

99
00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:57,890
Come on.
I'm gonna be safer if I blend in.

100
00:12:57,966 --> 00:12:59,433
I promise I'll keep a low profile.

101
00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:01,662
Look. Even if I let you, and I'm not,

102
00:13:01,703 --> 00:13:03,933
you can't just waltz into school
and start class...

103
00:13:04,005 --> 00:13:06,599
Do you think you're the only one
who can forge documents?

104
00:13:07,876 --> 00:13:10,344
Hm. Do you have a...?

105
00:13:10,378 --> 00:13:13,006
Five days of rations,
spare clothes, GPS, cash.

106
00:13:14,449 --> 00:13:15,711
- What's your name?
- John Smith.

107
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,274
- Where are you from?
- Toronto.

108
00:13:17,352 --> 00:13:19,252
You seem kind of tan for Toronto.

109
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,484
Santa Fe, New Mexico.
I know the drill, OK?

110
00:13:27,929 --> 00:13:29,453
You keep this on you.
I'll call you every hour.

111
00:13:29,531 --> 00:13:31,123
If you don't pick up,
I know something's wrong.

112
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:34,396
- Come on, every hour?
- That, or you can home school.

113
00:13:34,436 --> 00:13:36,461
And I'll be your teacher.

114
00:13:37,605 --> 00:13:38,970
Fine.

115
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,942
Hey, John, don't be stupid.
You keep your head down.

116
00:13:43,011 --> 00:13:44,387
I know how to blend in.

117
00:14:07,102 --> 00:14:08,467
OK, doll. Take a seat.

118
00:14:08,503 --> 00:14:10,971
I'll just print up your schedule.
Back in a jiffy.

119
00:14:14,843 --> 00:14:16,470
I know she's
the star photographer,

120
00:14:16,511 --> 00:14:18,411
but it's not fair
to the other students.

121
00:14:18,446 --> 00:14:20,107
She's using up all the vital supplies.

122
00:14:20,148 --> 00:14:23,982
Emory, come on. "Strangers in
Paradise." At least she's creative.

123
00:14:24,052 --> 00:14:26,543
The pictures on her website
are totally inappropriate.

124
00:14:26,621 --> 00:14:30,113
Mr. Behrman, if you want to keep
the photos, you should just say so.

125
00:14:30,158 --> 00:14:32,558
Keep the photos?
They're already all over the Internet!

126
00:14:32,627 --> 00:14:35,994
It's a violation to post things like
this without people's permission.

127
00:14:36,064 --> 00:14:37,361
You have to do something about this.

128
00:14:37,432 --> 00:14:39,866
Mr. Behrman,
excuse us for a few minutes, OK?

129
00:14:47,442 --> 00:14:50,843
Sarah, this is not like you.

130
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,313
Is there something going on?

131
00:14:53,348 --> 00:14:56,249
- Everything's fine.
- Sarah?

132
00:14:56,317 --> 00:14:59,309
- Honestly.
- Have a seat.

133
00:15:00,188 --> 00:15:03,487
You can't let a few negative students
get you down.

134
00:15:03,525 --> 00:15:07,325
Look, I don't want you to isolate
yourself from the rest of the school.

135
00:15:07,362 --> 00:15:12,390
- You should enjoy this year.
- OK, I'll try.

136
00:15:12,467 --> 00:15:15,561
- Good.
- Can I please have my camera back?

137
00:15:15,637 --> 00:15:19,266
No more photos on your website
without teacher and student permission.

138
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,035
OK.

139
00:15:21,109 --> 00:15:22,804
Here's your schedule.

140
00:15:26,314 --> 00:15:30,045
Homeroom is calculus.
That's B-wing, room seven...

141
00:15:30,118 --> 00:15:35,886
Oh, Sarah! Could you show our friend
to his locker? He's from Santa Fe.

142
00:15:35,924 --> 00:15:40,418
<i>Job fair starts tomorrow.
Everybody, job fair starts tomorrow.</i>

143
00:15:40,495 --> 00:15:43,589
What kind of camera do you use?

144
00:15:44,499 --> 00:15:46,865
Eavesdropping?
That's not gonna win you friends.

145
00:15:46,901 --> 00:15:48,528
- Check it out.
- What?

146
00:15:49,871 --> 00:15:52,704
Tell that to the principal
with a fish tank for an office.

147
00:15:53,408 --> 00:15:55,933
It's kind of hard not to hear.

148
00:15:57,245 --> 00:16:01,443
Sorry. This whole place
is kind of a fish tank.

149
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:04,908
Well...
Room seven is down the hall,

150
00:16:04,953 --> 00:16:07,581
and, uh, that's your locker right there.

151
00:16:09,524 --> 00:16:12,652
Good luck... um...

152
00:16:12,727 --> 00:16:14,524
Oh, uh, John...

153
00:16:14,562 --> 00:16:16,655
...Smith.

154
00:16:18,433 --> 00:16:21,732
OK. You don't want to tell me your name.

155
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:22,793
That's fine.

156
00:16:29,711 --> 00:16:33,147
That's really my name.
John Smith.

157
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,950
What's up, man? You new?

158
00:16:46,527 --> 00:16:50,827
Mark James. This is Kevin,
Jackson, Tyler and Max.

159
00:16:50,898 --> 00:16:52,627
- Hey, man, what's up?
- John.

160
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:54,635
Good to meet you, John.
Where are you from?

161
00:16:54,669 --> 00:16:57,638
- Santa Fe.
- Oh, New Mexico.

162
00:16:57,672 --> 00:16:59,003
Play any ball out there?

163
00:16:59,073 --> 00:17:01,633
- Football?
- Yeah.

164
00:17:01,676 --> 00:17:04,270
- No.
- Play anything?

165
00:17:04,312 --> 00:17:06,473
Baseball? Soccer? Ping-pong?

166
00:17:06,547 --> 00:17:08,981
Nope.

167
00:17:09,017 --> 00:17:12,612
OK. No, that's cool, man.
That's totally cool.

168
00:17:12,654 --> 00:17:14,622
We could always use more
boosters in the stands, right?

169
00:17:14,656 --> 00:17:18,956
Listen. You need anything,
you ask us, OK?

170
00:17:18,993 --> 00:17:22,019
- We got you.
- I'll keep that in mind.

171
00:17:22,096 --> 00:17:26,590
Good talking to you, big guy.

172
00:17:27,268 --> 00:17:28,633
Look who it is.

173
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,865
Watch out, man.

174
00:17:30,938 --> 00:17:32,530
Sorry, Sam.

175
00:17:32,607 --> 00:17:36,543
Loser!

176
00:17:39,013 --> 00:17:40,207
Wait up, fool.

177
00:17:40,281 --> 00:17:41,543
Thanks.

178
00:17:43,318 --> 00:17:44,910
Gotta love the classics.

179
00:17:44,986 --> 00:17:47,750
Homecoming king versus
the science nerd.

180
00:17:49,324 --> 00:17:51,815
Just get better with time, don't they?

181
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:55,351
- That guy, Mark, he's...
- Soon to be irrelevant.

182
00:17:55,396 --> 00:17:57,887
He's in the third year of
the best four years of his life.

183
00:19:00,528 --> 00:19:04,624
So, she was like, "The solar system's
sun does not revolve around the Earth."

184
00:19:04,699 --> 00:19:06,633
I said, "Yeah, right."

185
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:10,935
Hey, Spock!

186
00:19:11,005 --> 00:19:13,769
- Nailed it!
- Heads up! UFO, brother!

187
00:19:13,808 --> 00:19:16,140
That had to hurt.

188
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:17,939
Hey, stay down, man.
Just stay down.

189
00:19:18,012 --> 00:19:19,172
He's gonna cry. He's gonna cry.

190
00:19:19,247 --> 00:19:21,715
- Oh, Mommy's coming!
- Oh...

191
00:19:24,051 --> 00:19:26,315
- Right in the face.
- Hey, are you OK?

192
00:19:26,387 --> 00:19:30,289
- Assholes.
- Yo, new dude! Little help?

193
00:19:40,134 --> 00:19:42,068
Jesus!

194
00:19:42,103 --> 00:19:44,230
I'm fine! Get off me.

195
00:19:44,305 --> 00:19:46,068
Come on, man!

196
00:19:46,107 --> 00:19:48,098
- You OK?
- No.

197
00:19:51,913 --> 00:19:54,507
That's quite an arm
you got there.

198
00:19:54,582 --> 00:19:57,415
Yeah. Who knew?

199
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,786
So, uh, what's with the UFO thing?

200
00:20:03,524 --> 00:20:04,889
I know it's your first day and all,

201
00:20:04,959 --> 00:20:07,553
but, uh, sooner or later
you'll figure it out.

202
00:20:08,629 --> 00:20:09,755
Figure what out?

203
00:20:10,932 --> 00:20:13,366
I'm definitely not the guy
you want to hang with.

204
00:21:09,156 --> 00:21:11,215
Invisible.

205
00:21:11,259 --> 00:21:13,227
You heard me
when I said that, right?

206
00:21:13,261 --> 00:21:17,357
Yeah. Yeah, because
I remember you being there.

207
00:22:02,376 --> 00:22:06,278
<i>Let us face,
without panic, the reality of our times.</i>

208
00:22:06,314 --> 00:22:08,214
<i>The fact that atom bombs</i>

209
00:22:08,249 --> 00:22:12,447
<i>may, some day, be dropped on our cities.
And let us prepare for survival</i>

210
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,545
<i>by understanding the weapon
that threatens us.</i>

211
00:22:14,589 --> 00:22:15,613
Yeah.

212
00:22:21,862 --> 00:22:25,320
How you settling in, bro?

213
00:22:26,567 --> 00:22:29,627
- Fine, thanks.
- Good. That's good.

214
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:33,037
I see you and Spock are vibing.

215
00:22:33,107 --> 00:22:35,041
Got a bit of a soft spot
for freaks, do you?

216
00:22:35,109 --> 00:22:36,838
Who's talking?

217
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:41,848
Yikes.

218
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:45,909
Look. It's cute, it really is.
You are an adorable young man.

219
00:22:45,953 --> 00:22:48,148
But I find it irritating,

220
00:22:48,222 --> 00:22:50,349
so keep it on the bleachers, OK?

221
00:22:50,424 --> 00:22:52,517
- All right.
- Good. That's good.

222
00:22:52,593 --> 00:22:54,254
Also, while I'm here,

223
00:22:54,295 --> 00:22:55,922
I'm gonna let you in on a little tip.

224
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:15,210
Find your place fast.
Catch the rest of this flick, OK?

225
00:23:15,282 --> 00:23:17,375
Jesus, dude.
You are soaking wet.

226
00:23:46,847 --> 00:23:48,906
John, get up.
Come on. We gotta go.

227
00:23:48,983 --> 00:23:50,007
John.

228
00:23:50,051 --> 00:23:52,576
- John.
- My hands. What...?

229
00:23:52,653 --> 00:23:54,917
- Henri. My hands burn!
- John...

230
00:23:54,989 --> 00:23:56,923
- Look at me and relax.
- What's happening to me?

231
00:23:56,991 --> 00:23:58,549
They called them legacies back home.

232
00:23:58,626 --> 00:24:01,254
You, the nine,
you're the only ones who have them.

233
00:24:01,328 --> 00:24:02,659
- Legacies?
- That's right.

234
00:24:02,697 --> 00:24:04,722
Your parents were members
of the Lorien Garde.

235
00:24:04,765 --> 00:24:07,256
You've inherited their abilities. Gifts.

236
00:24:07,334 --> 00:24:08,460
- Gifts?
- That's right.

237
00:24:08,536 --> 00:24:10,333
My hands light up like road flares.

238
00:24:10,371 --> 00:24:12,931
- And you call that a gift?
- Each legacy has its own function.

239
00:24:13,007 --> 00:24:15,032
There's...
There's more coming?

240
00:24:15,076 --> 00:24:19,740
As you breathe and focus,
you're gonna learn to control them.

241
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:23,682
- OK. OK.
- Just like you're doing, right now.

242
00:24:23,718 --> 00:24:26,050
OK?

243
00:24:27,254 --> 00:24:28,414
How do your hands feel?

244
00:24:29,523 --> 00:24:33,584
- Better.
- Good.

245
00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:36,953
So, what now?

246
00:24:37,665 --> 00:24:39,155
Now?

247
00:24:39,233 --> 00:24:42,396
We wait. You're gonna keep
growing stronger and faster.

248
00:24:42,436 --> 00:24:44,165
I need you to be careful.

249
00:24:44,205 --> 00:24:47,299
Right now, you have to focus
your mind. Get some control.

250
00:24:47,374 --> 00:24:49,467
When you can do that,
you can get back to school.

251
00:24:49,543 --> 00:24:52,137
I don't want to raise suspicion.
I still have business here.

252
00:24:52,213 --> 00:24:54,044
In the meantime, your powers
will only draw attention.

253
00:24:54,081 --> 00:24:56,413
You keep yourself in check,
you understand?

254
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:59,044
So I got all these powers,
but I'm not allowed to use them?

255
00:24:59,086 --> 00:25:00,280
Exactly.

256
00:27:00,407 --> 00:27:03,638
A little early for Thanksgiving.

257
00:27:04,745 --> 00:27:06,269
Paper or plastic?

258
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,264
Whoa.

259
00:27:52,626 --> 00:27:53,752
And you wind it here...

260
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,309
"Strangers in Paradise"?

261
00:28:17,885 --> 00:28:20,445
I know. Arty, pretentious.

262
00:28:20,487 --> 00:28:22,682
Uh... That's not actually
what I was gonna say.

263
00:28:22,756 --> 00:28:26,055
I just needed a name for my website
and it was right there.

264
00:28:28,295 --> 00:28:32,129
You know, they should've
called this town "Ironic."

265
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:35,192
Ironic, Ohio?
Has a ring to it.

266
00:28:37,905 --> 00:28:41,397
What's up with you?
You look different, or something.

267
00:28:41,475 --> 00:28:43,340
Sarah, come over!
I got a new bike!

268
00:28:43,377 --> 00:28:46,005
OK, I will next week.

269
00:28:46,046 --> 00:28:48,378
- Hold this for a second.
- All right.

270
00:28:48,449 --> 00:28:50,508
Oh, they're so cute.

271
00:28:50,584 --> 00:28:52,677
You know, uh... I mean it.

272
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,312
Uh... Your photographs...

273
00:28:54,355 --> 00:28:56,846
My parents make me babysit
for film money,

274
00:28:56,924 --> 00:29:01,054
and those are two of my victims.

275
00:29:01,128 --> 00:29:03,528
You know, I'm, uh...

276
00:29:03,597 --> 00:29:06,998
I'm actually trying to
pay you a compliment, but, uh...

277
00:29:07,034 --> 00:29:08,433
...it's not going so well.

278
00:29:09,536 --> 00:29:11,060
Oh.

279
00:29:11,739 --> 00:29:14,037
Right. Um...

280
00:29:16,176 --> 00:29:17,370
Thank you.

281
00:29:19,313 --> 00:29:22,714
I don't know, I just, um,
see better through this thing.

282
00:29:25,085 --> 00:29:27,679
It's like my own
personal BS detector.

283
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,218
Come on! Let's go!

284
00:29:33,293 --> 00:29:37,229
Excuse me. Did you forget something?
You had two things to do, you know?

285
00:29:37,297 --> 00:29:39,458
- Lock the door and turn off the lights!
- That's Sam's dad?

286
00:29:39,533 --> 00:29:40,591
His stepdad.

287
00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:43,693
Every night
it's the same thing with you!

288
00:29:49,009 --> 00:29:50,476
This is it.

289
00:29:59,086 --> 00:30:00,348
You live here?

290
00:30:01,588 --> 00:30:04,022
Yeah, I grew up here.

291
00:30:08,462 --> 00:30:12,023
- It's just a house.
- I know.

292
00:30:17,738 --> 00:30:18,932
You hungry?

293
00:30:19,006 --> 00:30:22,305
So, John, just moved
from Santa Fe a few weeks ago.

294
00:30:22,376 --> 00:30:23,968
- The Smiths, right?
- Uh, yes, sir.

295
00:30:24,044 --> 00:30:27,104
- And your father's a writer?
- Yes, he is.

296
00:30:27,147 --> 00:30:29,843
Everybody really does know everything
in this town.

297
00:30:29,917 --> 00:30:32,442
Oh, gossip spreads like Ebola.

298
00:30:32,486 --> 00:30:33,783
Question game!

299
00:30:33,821 --> 00:30:36,119
Oh! Sorry, my bad.

300
00:30:36,156 --> 00:30:38,283
- All right, everybody, surrender them.
- Here you go.

301
00:30:38,358 --> 00:30:41,657
All electronic devices.
Come on, Sarah. Thank you.

302
00:30:41,728 --> 00:30:42,854
Hand them over.

303
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:44,727
- And you.
- Mom?

304
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:47,733
He'll get it back after dinner.
You'll get it back after dinner.

305
00:30:47,768 --> 00:30:50,328
- Thank you, John. See? It's fine.
- All right.

306
00:30:50,404 --> 00:30:54,738
So, Santa Fe's kind of hip, right?
You bored silly here?

307
00:30:54,775 --> 00:30:57,437
Nah, not with the spring carnival
coming up!

308
00:30:57,478 --> 00:31:00,413
It's fun, and you and your folks
should definitely come.

309
00:31:00,447 --> 00:31:02,745
Oh, it's just me and my dad.

310
00:31:03,784 --> 00:31:04,808
Where's your mom?

311
00:31:04,852 --> 00:31:06,444
- Uh... My...
- Mom.

312
00:31:06,487 --> 00:31:10,981
No, it's fine. My dad and mom,
uh, they didn't get married.

313
00:31:11,058 --> 00:31:13,959
Uh, you know, check it out.
Carnival.

314
00:31:13,994 --> 00:31:16,360
Sarah will be there
taking pictures for the paper.

315
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,522
Cheap labor.

316
00:31:17,598 --> 00:31:19,190
- That is not why.
- No.

317
00:31:19,266 --> 00:31:22,030
- She's a very talented photographer.
- Question game!

318
00:31:22,102 --> 00:31:25,162
OK. Keep your voice down,
and we will play.

319
00:31:25,205 --> 00:31:28,902
It's a dinner tradition. Otherwise,
we'd never talk about the good stuff.

320
00:31:28,976 --> 00:31:30,341
Worst advice you ever got?

321
00:31:31,345 --> 00:31:32,642
"Pull this."

322
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:33,907
Oh, stop!

323
00:31:33,981 --> 00:31:35,573
That's really gross.

324
00:31:35,649 --> 00:31:36,843
OK, um...

325
00:31:36,884 --> 00:31:39,148
"Your parents will never know
you're gone."

326
00:31:39,186 --> 00:31:41,211
It worked with your folks.
That's how she got here.

327
00:31:41,288 --> 00:31:42,778
- Stop it. Stop.
- Oh, my God.

328
00:31:42,823 --> 00:31:44,791
- What?
- OK, Sarah, your turn.

329
00:31:44,858 --> 00:31:49,591
Oh. Mom telling me that self-tanner
looks totally natural.

330
00:31:49,663 --> 00:31:51,858
She was orange.

331
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:54,367
Like a traffic cone.
On picture day.

332
00:31:54,434 --> 00:31:55,924
Oh, you should go get that picture.

333
00:31:56,003 --> 00:31:57,231
- We still have the picture!
- John, you are gonna...

334
00:31:57,304 --> 00:31:59,033
Why would you want
to show him that?

335
00:31:59,106 --> 00:32:01,370
I shouldn't have said it.

336
00:32:01,441 --> 00:32:03,534
I think I tore them up.

337
00:32:09,449 --> 00:32:11,280
Sorry about that.

338
00:32:12,486 --> 00:32:16,513
- About what?
- My parents.

339
00:32:16,557 --> 00:32:20,015
They were putting on the
"aren't we cool?" show.

340
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,721
They seem very proud of you.

341
00:32:21,795 --> 00:32:23,729
Yeah, and they're already
trying to convince me

342
00:32:23,797 --> 00:32:26,095
to go to the local community college
in Dayton.

343
00:32:26,166 --> 00:32:29,226
They'd love it if I stayed here.

344
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:32,397
Got into wedding photography.

345
00:32:32,472 --> 00:32:35,441
What do you want to do?

346
00:32:39,546 --> 00:32:41,377
That's my favorite.

347
00:32:41,415 --> 00:32:42,939
It's got all these light leaks

348
00:32:43,016 --> 00:32:46,076
so the photos come out so interesting.

349
00:32:47,221 --> 00:32:48,950
Here, I'll show you.

350
00:32:58,865 --> 00:33:00,992
See that one right there?

351
00:33:01,068 --> 00:33:02,968
That's what I was talking about.

352
00:33:04,638 --> 00:33:06,333
What's this?

353
00:33:08,175 --> 00:33:09,199
Um...

354
00:33:10,978 --> 00:33:16,211
That is kind of private, actually.

355
00:33:18,118 --> 00:33:19,881
It's amazing.

356
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:28,027
- What?
- You...

357
00:33:29,263 --> 00:33:31,788
You're allowed
to look at everyone else...

358
00:33:31,865 --> 00:33:36,131
...take our pictures, but, uh...
we're not allowed to see you?

359
00:33:42,776 --> 00:33:44,971
OK.
That's enough.

360
00:33:48,081 --> 00:33:49,946
Seems like you want to run away.

361
00:33:49,983 --> 00:33:52,008
I'll just be happy
when I can get out of here.

362
00:33:52,085 --> 00:33:53,814
I don't know.
I've been to a lot of places.

363
00:33:53,887 --> 00:33:56,355
You don't have to give me the
"there's no place like home" speech.

364
00:33:56,423 --> 00:33:57,981
I've heard it.

365
00:33:58,025 --> 00:34:01,654
No, no. You can go wherever you want,
see whatever you want to.

366
00:34:01,695 --> 00:34:06,064
But a place is only as good
as the people you know in it.

367
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:10,732
I, uh...

368
00:34:16,443 --> 00:34:19,742
I think this is a pretty good place.

369
00:34:33,327 --> 00:34:36,296
Bernie, you dumb dog.

370
00:34:38,498 --> 00:34:41,058
- Does he belong to you?
- Yeah. I gotta go.

371
00:34:41,134 --> 00:34:44,763
Well, hey. Hold on a sec.

372
00:34:48,408 --> 00:34:49,670
Um...

373
00:34:54,348 --> 00:34:55,781
Your turn.

374
00:35:00,053 --> 00:35:01,384
Thanks.

375
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:18,094
I'm fine.

376
00:35:18,171 --> 00:35:20,605
Heard you made quite an impression
in class yesterday.

377
00:35:20,674 --> 00:35:23,939
Flashlight. It was a dumb prank.
But that class...

378
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:27,036
- Boring as hell? Yeah.
- Yeah.

379
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:31,244
Look, I know it's none of my business,
but you need to stay off the grid.

380
00:35:31,318 --> 00:35:33,081
- What do you mean?
- It's all over the school.

381
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,486
Mark James and his man-tards
have it out for you.

382
00:35:35,555 --> 00:35:37,580
Sarah may act like one of us...

383
00:35:37,657 --> 00:35:38,783
...she's one of them.

384
00:35:38,859 --> 00:35:40,087
He's into Sarah?

385
00:35:40,127 --> 00:35:43,096
More than that.
Nobody can go near her.

386
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:44,825
They were like the town...

387
00:35:44,898 --> 00:35:47,230
Whoa!

388
00:35:47,267 --> 00:35:48,632
Loser!

389
00:35:48,702 --> 00:35:52,570
No... OK, come on...
Oh, God.

390
00:35:53,407 --> 00:35:55,602
- Sucks to be you, bro!
- Seriously.

391
00:35:55,675 --> 00:35:59,236
Want a napkin? Get a cleanup crew!

392
00:36:01,715 --> 00:36:04,047
I wonder who did that?

393
00:36:06,019 --> 00:36:07,316
What a loser.

394
00:36:07,387 --> 00:36:09,048
Leave me alone!

395
00:36:11,825 --> 00:36:13,952
Ah, ah, ah...

396
00:36:17,597 --> 00:36:20,259
Did you have a nice time
last night, John?

397
00:36:21,635 --> 00:36:26,129
You see, in football,
a quarterback needs a few things.

398
00:36:26,173 --> 00:36:27,663
Speed, strength...

399
00:36:27,741 --> 00:36:31,438
Mostly, though, you need intuition.

400
00:36:31,478 --> 00:36:33,844
A feeling when things
are going south.

401
00:36:35,949 --> 00:36:38,884
First time we talked,
I should've listened to mine.

402
00:36:48,195 --> 00:36:51,562
There you go, John.

403
00:36:52,933 --> 00:36:55,663
Good boy.

404
00:36:55,735 --> 00:36:58,465
Maybe you got some intuition
working for you, too.

405
00:37:02,175 --> 00:37:03,506
That was awesome.

406
00:37:09,449 --> 00:37:11,314
Raided lost and found.

407
00:37:11,351 --> 00:37:14,115
- Nobody loses anything cool.
- You gotta be kidding me.

408
00:37:14,154 --> 00:37:18,386
<i>Dude, it was that or the Hannah
Montana sweatshirt. You got off easy.</i>

409
00:37:18,458 --> 00:37:21,450
So, uh...

410
00:37:21,495 --> 00:37:25,124
...who's in the picture?
- My dad.

411
00:37:25,165 --> 00:37:27,463
The real one.

412
00:37:38,111 --> 00:37:39,339
<i>Where was that taken?</i>

413
00:37:40,881 --> 00:37:44,282
Mexico. The Yucatán.

414
00:37:44,317 --> 00:37:48,083
We used to go every year looking
for evidence of ancient astronauts.

415
00:37:48,922 --> 00:37:50,514
Ancient astronauts?

416
00:37:50,557 --> 00:37:53,526
Yeah. UFOs and shit.

417
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,619
Freak show stuff.

418
00:37:55,695 --> 00:37:58,357
He called himself an anthropologist...

419
00:37:58,398 --> 00:38:00,958
<i>He was really just a foreman
at the steel mill.</i>

420
00:38:03,603 --> 00:38:07,095
<i>He spent all his time preparing
for some kind of alien arrival.</i>

421
00:38:08,909 --> 00:38:10,570
I used to think he was a genius.

422
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:13,545
Had to, I guess.

423
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,105
Nobody wants to admit
their dad's a freak.

424
00:38:31,031 --> 00:38:32,123
Sam...

425
00:38:32,899 --> 00:38:34,264
Sam.

426
00:38:38,171 --> 00:38:39,399
Oh!

427
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,771
Malcolm, what were you up to here?

428
00:41:49,028 --> 00:41:51,394
Jimmy, Vince,
come on, slow down, boys!

429
00:42:15,054 --> 00:42:16,783
- Hey, Sarah.
- Hey!

430
00:42:30,303 --> 00:42:33,363
Mark James decided to fire
a warning shot about you.

431
00:42:36,442 --> 00:42:40,708
When you first meet somebody,
do you dump all your stuff on them?

432
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:43,010
All your mistakes, your secrets?

433
00:42:44,184 --> 00:42:48,678
Look, Mark and I, we changed.

434
00:42:48,755 --> 00:42:50,655
I got into photography,

435
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:54,990
and he wanted me to be
his own personal cheerleader.

436
00:42:55,028 --> 00:42:58,555
Said I was becoming a total snob.

437
00:42:58,631 --> 00:43:02,032
And when we broke up,
that's what he told everybody.

438
00:43:02,101 --> 00:43:06,128
That I was a total bitch.
And everyone listened.

439
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:10,202
All my friends.

440
00:43:13,112 --> 00:43:15,672
Uh... I'm sorry.

441
00:43:15,715 --> 00:43:18,878
I'm not. I mean, I was...

442
00:43:19,853 --> 00:43:22,048
...but, um, I don't know,

443
00:43:22,121 --> 00:43:25,215
I kinda look at it like a total gift.

444
00:43:25,258 --> 00:43:27,158
Got away from all of that.

445
00:43:28,528 --> 00:43:32,931
So, uh, what's the hottest attraction
at this place?

446
00:43:39,806 --> 00:43:42,434
You gotta be kidding me, right?
This...

447
00:43:42,508 --> 00:43:44,100
Don't be scared.

448
00:44:04,731 --> 00:44:09,100
<i>Save yourself.</i>

449
00:44:26,252 --> 00:44:29,085
Last year, she was drawn and quartered.

450
00:44:29,122 --> 00:44:31,613
It was awesome.

451
00:44:34,894 --> 00:44:37,624
My God.

452
00:44:48,241 --> 00:44:49,970
Hell's Gate.

453
00:44:50,543 --> 00:44:52,773
Everybody off.

454
00:45:14,033 --> 00:45:15,660
Quite a production.

455
00:45:15,702 --> 00:45:19,695
Hm. Small town.

456
00:45:32,018 --> 00:45:35,351
OK. The last part got to me.

457
00:45:37,056 --> 00:45:39,081
What is that?

458
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,685
Don't! Let him go! Let him go!

459
00:45:42,729 --> 00:45:45,027
Stop it!

460
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,424
Hello?

461
00:45:50,603 --> 00:45:52,901
Was that real? Are you all right?

462
00:45:54,841 --> 00:45:56,866
Let me go! Stop it!

463
00:45:56,943 --> 00:45:58,774
Leave him alone!

464
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,868
- No!
- Whoa! Calm down.

465
00:46:22,902 --> 00:46:25,894
- Oh, my God. Just get off me!
- Sarah, come here!

466
00:46:25,972 --> 00:46:28,566
- Idiot! It's you!
- Calm down! Calm down!

467
00:46:28,641 --> 00:46:30,905
- Let go of me.
- You can take off, OK?

468
00:46:30,977 --> 00:46:33,411
- Let go of me! Let go of me!
- Hey, listen. I will. I will!

469
00:46:34,013 --> 00:46:35,275
Sarah!

470
00:46:49,062 --> 00:46:51,030
Where is she?

471
00:46:51,064 --> 00:46:52,759
It burns, man!

472
00:46:52,799 --> 00:46:56,064
Dude, let go of me, bro, it hurts!

473
00:46:56,102 --> 00:46:59,037
She's at Shepherd Falls!
Dude, put me down. What is that?

474
00:47:04,277 --> 00:47:05,266
Where's John?

475
00:47:05,344 --> 00:47:08,472
I don't get what happened to us.
I don't. I really don't.

476
00:47:08,548 --> 00:47:10,812
So you have your friend
throw me over his shoulder,

477
00:47:10,883 --> 00:47:12,783
drag me through the woods
to come here,

478
00:47:12,819 --> 00:47:16,846
when all you had to do is ask me!
Like a normal person!

479
00:47:16,923 --> 00:47:20,654
You don't have to tell me
I'm being an asshole, OK?

480
00:47:20,726 --> 00:47:23,957
But you're a problem for me, Sarah.

481
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:26,965
Yeah, well, you really
should get over that.

482
00:47:27,033 --> 00:47:30,469
- Wait. Sarah, wait.
- Just stop it!

483
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:32,862
You OK?

484
00:47:45,184 --> 00:47:47,550
I hope you can throw
with your left hand.

485
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:51,886
No, John, stop! Stop!

486
00:48:03,002 --> 00:48:05,300
John. John, stop. Wait.

487
00:48:05,338 --> 00:48:08,364
Hey. I just didn't want you
to break his arm.

488
00:48:08,441 --> 00:48:10,841
It's not you, it's me.
I shouldn't have lost it like that.

489
00:48:10,877 --> 00:48:12,572
Hey.

490
00:48:14,981 --> 00:48:16,812
Will you walk me home?

491
00:48:25,791 --> 00:48:28,021
You should really get that looked at.

492
00:48:29,529 --> 00:48:30,860
I will.

493
00:48:32,165 --> 00:48:33,723
I, uh...

494
00:48:39,438 --> 00:48:40,803
I think we should talk.

495
00:48:44,443 --> 00:48:47,378
I know. It's crazy.

496
00:48:48,548 --> 00:48:50,015
Mark is insane.

497
00:48:50,049 --> 00:48:52,950
And this is our last year.

498
00:48:53,019 --> 00:48:55,010
Who knows where you'll be
in three months?

499
00:48:55,054 --> 00:48:57,682
Exactly.

500
00:48:58,591 --> 00:49:00,149
Who knows?

501
00:49:02,261 --> 00:49:05,094
So, I guess I'll just...

502
00:49:05,164 --> 00:49:07,029
...see you when I see you?

503
00:49:08,267 --> 00:49:09,529
Yeah.

504
00:49:12,138 --> 00:49:13,503
OK.

505
00:49:20,346 --> 00:49:22,439
Your hand's really warm.

506
00:49:39,031 --> 00:49:40,965
All I think about is you.

507
00:49:41,033 --> 00:49:43,661
All I think about is you, too.

508
00:50:07,593 --> 00:50:09,356
Where did you come from?

509
00:50:11,897 --> 00:50:14,297
All right, Mom! I got it!

510
00:50:22,908 --> 00:50:25,001
- I, uh...
- Yeah, I should go.

511
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:35,598
Bye.

512
00:51:34,213 --> 00:51:37,341
John! In here.

513
00:51:40,286 --> 00:51:41,913
So, what are you?

514
00:51:44,457 --> 00:51:47,654
You threw those football players
around like it was nothing.

515
00:51:47,693 --> 00:51:51,561
And the hand thing?
That's not human.

516
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:54,929
So I'm asking you, what are you?

517
00:51:57,570 --> 00:51:59,128
Do I need to threaten you?

518
00:51:59,205 --> 00:52:01,571
All right, 'cause I got
some pictures on my phone,

519
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,039
and they're gonna start
some major questions.

520
00:52:03,075 --> 00:52:05,043
- Give me that.
- No.

521
00:52:05,077 --> 00:52:07,409
You know I can hurt you. Hm?

522
00:52:23,929 --> 00:52:26,159
Knock yourself out.

523
00:52:33,339 --> 00:52:36,365
My entire childhood...

524
00:52:37,443 --> 00:52:39,070
<i>...has been an episode of X- Files.</i>

525
00:52:42,081 --> 00:52:44,572
You know what it's like
to feel something...

526
00:52:45,684 --> 00:52:48,448
...so strong...

527
00:52:48,487 --> 00:52:50,421
...that every day you have
to keep telling yourself

528
00:52:50,456 --> 00:52:53,584
your dad's gonna come back
and take you away from this shithole.

529
00:52:53,626 --> 00:52:56,322
And that everything
we believed in was true.

530
00:52:56,395 --> 00:52:58,863
And that we were not crazy.

531
00:53:03,269 --> 00:53:04,293
Please.

532
00:53:09,708 --> 00:53:11,198
Please.

533
00:53:14,814 --> 00:53:16,145
Your dad was right.

534
00:53:17,917 --> 00:53:19,145
What?

535
00:53:25,291 --> 00:53:26,849
He was right.

536
00:53:29,195 --> 00:53:31,425
About ancient astronauts...

537
00:53:32,398 --> 00:53:34,958
...life on other planets...

538
00:53:37,269 --> 00:53:38,566
...all of it.

539
00:53:42,942 --> 00:53:46,469
Yes! I knew... I knew he
wouldn't just leave us!

540
00:53:46,512 --> 00:53:50,471
I mean, they found his truck near the
border of Mexico, and he was just gone.

541
00:53:50,516 --> 00:53:52,347
- Maybe they took him.
- Sam...

542
00:53:52,418 --> 00:53:54,716
If he knew you were here,
he'd come home.

543
00:53:54,787 --> 00:53:58,120
- You can't tell anyone.
- No, I-I-I wouldn't.

544
00:53:58,157 --> 00:54:00,352
No, no, no. You gotta promise me.
Nobody knows this.

545
00:54:00,426 --> 00:54:04,556
There are others from where I'm from
looking for me.

546
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:06,928
I'm not safe.

547
00:54:06,999 --> 00:54:11,936
Sam! I know you are in there.
Get your ass in the house, now!

548
00:54:13,038 --> 00:54:14,471
Wait until I get inside and then go.

549
00:54:14,507 --> 00:54:16,236
Sam?

550
00:54:18,244 --> 00:54:19,472
I promise.

551
00:54:22,047 --> 00:54:24,743
Yes!

552
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:29,344
Come on.

553
00:54:43,836 --> 00:54:45,736
Hey, you maniac.

554
00:54:45,804 --> 00:54:49,171
- Hello, son.
- Hey, what's with the, uh...?

555
00:54:53,612 --> 00:54:54,601
Hello, Dad.

556
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:56,739
Sheriff James says
some boys got hurt last night.

557
00:54:56,815 --> 00:54:58,874
Couple of them
spent the night in the hospital.

558
00:54:58,918 --> 00:55:00,408
- You said it was four?
- Yeah, four.

559
00:55:00,486 --> 00:55:03,512
- On the football team.
- Yeah, that's right.

560
00:55:03,556 --> 00:55:07,890
Of course, none of them are talking.
That includes my own boy, Mark.

561
00:55:09,595 --> 00:55:13,725
- Your son is Mark?
- Yeah, that's right.

562
00:55:13,766 --> 00:55:15,791
You know, that was his
throwing arm that got hurt.

563
00:55:15,868 --> 00:55:17,859
He said you were there.

564
00:55:20,105 --> 00:55:22,596
Uh, no. I was actually with a girl.

565
00:55:22,641 --> 00:55:26,737
So I wasn't paying any attention.
Um...

566
00:55:26,779 --> 00:55:27,803
Sarah Hart?

567
00:55:31,517 --> 00:55:36,079
Well, no one wants to be the first
one to say what really happened.

568
00:55:36,121 --> 00:55:39,613
But, eventually, someone will.

569
00:55:39,658 --> 00:55:42,354
I'm sure you're right.
Thank you, Sheriff.

570
00:55:42,428 --> 00:55:44,794
If we hear anything,
we'll let you know.

571
00:56:05,017 --> 00:56:07,679
- Four of them, huh?
- Yeah.

572
00:56:09,288 --> 00:56:11,051
Was it difficult?

573
00:56:11,924 --> 00:56:13,983
Piece of cake.

574
00:56:14,026 --> 00:56:16,654
Good. Means you're getting it.

575
00:56:16,695 --> 00:56:18,720
Go upstairs, pack your stuff.

576
00:56:18,797 --> 00:56:20,162
Because of last night?

577
00:56:20,232 --> 00:56:22,826
Because I don't like people
showing up asking questions.

578
00:56:22,901 --> 00:56:25,927
- And I think this is gonna raise a few.
- "They walk among us."

579
00:56:25,971 --> 00:56:27,871
What is this? Some more
"truth is out there" freaks?

580
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:30,841
Except that's actually you.

581
00:56:30,909 --> 00:56:33,070
One of the kids must
have caught you on video.

582
00:56:33,145 --> 00:56:34,544
Oh, shit.

583
00:56:34,613 --> 00:56:36,672
<i>He's some kind of freak!</i>

584
00:56:36,715 --> 00:56:38,012
I can't get through the firewall.

585
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:39,847
We have to go there
and take it down ourselves.

586
00:56:39,918 --> 00:56:42,045
Mogs see this, just a matter of time.

587
00:56:42,121 --> 00:56:44,419
Pack your stuff. We're leaving.

588
00:56:45,791 --> 00:56:47,554
I'm not going.

589
00:56:48,927 --> 00:56:50,724
I'm sorry, what did you say?

590
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:53,491
I'm not going.

591
00:56:53,532 --> 00:56:56,763
OK. If you want to pick
the next place, that's fine...

592
00:56:56,835 --> 00:56:58,530
It's not my fight and it never was!

593
00:56:58,604 --> 00:57:00,868
I can't even remember
a world before this one.

594
00:57:00,939 --> 00:57:02,770
Wait, wait...

595
00:57:02,841 --> 00:57:05,173
...is this because of a girl?

596
00:57:07,012 --> 00:57:09,003
Go upstairs and get your stuff.

597
00:57:10,182 --> 00:57:13,379
- You're not my father.
- No, no, no. He's dead.

598
00:57:13,419 --> 00:57:16,252
He died for you.
In fact, you know what?

599
00:57:16,321 --> 00:57:20,223
You have no idea how many others
have made sacrifices so you could live!

600
00:57:20,292 --> 00:57:21,782
And it wasn't so you could come here

601
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:24,021
and experience puppy love
like a real live boy!

602
00:57:24,063 --> 00:57:25,758
I'm not leaving.

603
00:57:28,567 --> 00:57:31,434
John... John!

604
00:57:31,503 --> 00:57:32,765
I'm not leaving!

605
00:57:34,039 --> 00:57:37,600
Oh, yeah, I can do that now.

606
00:57:43,882 --> 00:57:45,042
Hey, John!

607
00:57:56,028 --> 00:57:58,462
I'm letting go, OK?

608
00:57:59,598 --> 00:58:01,361
- OK?
- OK.

609
00:58:12,344 --> 00:58:15,438
- On our planet...
- Just tell me why they want to kill me.

610
00:58:15,481 --> 00:58:19,975
The Mogs, they don't colonize.
They decimate. And then they move on.

611
00:58:20,052 --> 00:58:22,748
And now, they've moved here.

612
00:58:22,788 --> 00:58:27,725
There are few forces that can stop them.
You and the other five can.

613
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,421
You were saved for a bigger purpose.

614
00:58:29,461 --> 00:58:33,124
I'm not gonna let you throw that away
for a girl.

615
00:58:33,165 --> 00:58:35,633
She's not just a girl.

616
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:40,297
I think about leaving her...

617
00:58:40,939 --> 00:58:42,930
...but I can't.

618
00:58:42,975 --> 00:58:45,409
And I don't know why.

619
00:58:49,381 --> 00:58:53,283
We don't love like the humans.
With us, it's forever.

620
00:58:57,389 --> 00:58:59,220
You never forget.

621
00:59:01,727 --> 00:59:06,164
If she is that for you,
then don't let them win.

622
00:59:06,198 --> 00:59:08,564
Or you'll never forgive yourself.

623
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:12,694
Now, we have to go.

624
00:59:14,006 --> 00:59:16,668
I'll take care of the website tonight.
Buy you a day.

625
00:59:16,742 --> 00:59:20,576
A day? To say goodbye?

626
00:59:20,646 --> 00:59:22,876
That's more than the rest of us had.

627
00:59:41,366 --> 00:59:43,266
<i>He's some kind of freak!</i>

628
00:59:53,879 --> 00:59:56,575
Henri, I'm going to Sarah's.

629
01:00:00,519 --> 01:00:01,543
Henri?

630
01:00:22,841 --> 01:00:25,605
Henri? Hello? Henri?

631
01:00:25,677 --> 01:00:30,307
<i>No, but come here
and I'll tell you how to find him.</i>

632
01:00:30,382 --> 01:00:32,179
Who are you? Where's Henri?

633
01:00:32,217 --> 01:00:35,118
<i>417 Willard Court,
Warsaw, Indiana.</i>

634
01:00:45,931 --> 01:00:48,229
Come on, come on.

635
01:00:48,267 --> 01:00:49,791
I need your help.

636
01:00:54,973 --> 01:00:56,804
So, you guys... you guys don't...

637
01:00:56,875 --> 01:00:59,207
- Abduct people?
- Yeah.

638
01:00:59,244 --> 01:01:00,268
No.

639
01:01:00,312 --> 01:01:03,770
But the other guys,
the ones that are chasing you...

640
01:01:03,849 --> 01:01:05,009
...they do?

641
01:01:26,405 --> 01:01:27,895
That's it.

642
01:01:29,775 --> 01:01:31,106
Thanks.

643
01:01:38,884 --> 01:01:41,375
Whoa! You brought a gun?

644
01:01:41,453 --> 01:01:44,445
I stole it from Ed.
It might come in handy. Let's go.

645
01:01:44,523 --> 01:01:47,856
- No.
- Dude, I came here to help you.

646
01:01:47,926 --> 01:01:51,453
You have. Now, go home.

647
01:02:09,715 --> 01:02:11,376
Whoa!

648
01:02:14,119 --> 01:02:16,178
- What are you doing?
- I'm not bailing.

649
01:02:16,254 --> 01:02:17,983
What if these Mog people took my dad?

650
01:02:50,022 --> 01:02:54,459
Holy shit!

651
01:02:54,526 --> 01:02:56,687
But you just dead-bolted it.

652
01:02:58,196 --> 01:03:00,892
- OK. New plan.
- Yeah.

653
01:03:00,966 --> 01:03:04,060
You follow that guy and you
text me if he comes back, OK?

654
01:03:04,102 --> 01:03:05,933
Copy that. I'm on it.

655
01:04:40,165 --> 01:04:41,189
Henri.

656
01:04:55,647 --> 01:04:57,444
- Are you OK?
- You're not supposed to be here.

657
01:04:57,482 --> 01:04:59,643
- What happened?
- The Mogs set this up.

658
01:04:59,684 --> 01:05:02,517
We need to leave. They're coming.

659
01:05:02,554 --> 01:05:05,523
Everybody stays right where they are
or I'll shoot this kid.

660
01:05:05,557 --> 01:05:08,151
I'll do it!
Get your hands up!

661
01:05:08,193 --> 01:05:09,490
So glad you brought the gun.

662
01:05:10,862 --> 01:05:12,193
You're Malcolm's boy.

663
01:05:13,532 --> 01:05:16,797
- Get the lights, will you?
- Shut up! Get your hands up!

664
01:05:22,674 --> 01:05:23,698
Oh!

665
01:05:28,847 --> 01:05:32,374
You! You're the one
from the video on our site.

666
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:35,510
- The one they're after.
- The one who's after?

667
01:05:35,554 --> 01:05:38,352
- What's he talking about?
- The Mogs, they've been here.

668
01:05:38,390 --> 01:05:39,721
- This was a trap.
- Yeah.

669
01:05:39,791 --> 01:05:43,227
These dudes, whatever they are, man,
they got plans, know what I'm sayin'?

670
01:05:43,261 --> 01:05:45,559
- John...
- I'm that guy, the conspiracy guy.

671
01:05:45,597 --> 01:05:48,532
Nobody gives a crap what I say.
But this is real, man!

672
01:05:48,567 --> 01:05:49,966
John. It's time to leave.

673
01:05:50,035 --> 01:05:53,732
They like it here, Earth. They're gonna
take all this shit, everything!

674
01:05:53,805 --> 01:05:55,102
John! Now!

675
01:05:55,173 --> 01:05:57,198
We either do what they say
or we are all gonna die.

676
01:05:57,242 --> 01:05:59,710
It's time to go! Now!

677
01:06:15,694 --> 01:06:18,788
John. John! John, no!

678
01:06:53,231 --> 01:06:55,096
John, go!

679
01:06:55,133 --> 01:06:56,600
- Now!
- Go!

680
01:07:22,761 --> 01:07:25,286
Start the car.
Come on! Get us out of here!

681
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:27,025
- I can't find the keys!
- What do you mean?

682
01:07:27,098 --> 01:07:29,589
- I can't find the keys!
- Come on! Come on!

683
01:07:30,435 --> 01:07:32,665
Guys, what are we waiting for?

684
01:07:34,506 --> 01:07:36,406
- I've lost the keys!
- John, start the engine.

685
01:07:36,474 --> 01:07:39,602
- What?
- You can do it. Start the car.

686
01:07:42,380 --> 01:07:44,610
- Come on.
- Start the car.

687
01:07:51,356 --> 01:07:53,551
Whoa, whoa. Come on, come on!
He's coming! He's coming!

688
01:07:53,625 --> 01:07:55,024
Start the car! Start the car!

689
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:57,961
Use your magic powers!
Come on! We are so dead!

690
01:07:59,464 --> 01:08:02,024
Oh, my God!

691
01:08:06,004 --> 01:08:08,234
Go! Drive the car!

692
01:08:19,851 --> 01:08:21,546
You take this.

693
01:08:26,891 --> 01:08:29,359
Malcolm was using it
to track the others.

694
01:08:29,394 --> 01:08:32,659
- Wait. So, my dad was...
- He was helping us.

695
01:08:32,697 --> 01:08:34,892
He was supposed to bring us together.

696
01:08:36,701 --> 01:08:38,032
You need to find the others.

697
01:08:38,970 --> 01:08:40,460
Together you'll be more powerful.

698
01:08:53,017 --> 01:08:54,917
I can't do this without you.

699
01:08:57,021 --> 01:08:58,283
Yes, you can.

700
01:08:59,991 --> 01:09:01,686
Yes, you can.

701
01:09:03,795 --> 01:09:07,754
You have no idea
what you're capable of.

702
01:09:14,005 --> 01:09:15,029
Henri.

703
01:10:10,995 --> 01:10:12,428
Just let me talk.

704
01:10:14,098 --> 01:10:16,760
OK. So, I called you like you said.

705
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:21,036
I mean, it's not my fault they got...

706
01:10:22,807 --> 01:10:24,798
I mean, we held up our end.

707
01:10:24,843 --> 01:10:27,334
- Hm.
- We're still in?

708
01:10:27,412 --> 01:10:30,711
The whole new world order thing?

709
01:10:30,782 --> 01:10:34,775
The Locator.

710
01:10:34,819 --> 01:10:37,481
- Where is it?
- OK.

711
01:10:37,522 --> 01:10:41,686
All he had was a knife and that rock.

712
01:10:43,027 --> 01:10:44,119
And I put it...

713
01:10:46,231 --> 01:10:50,600
- It was over there, man.
- "It was over there, man."

714
01:10:50,668 --> 01:10:52,727
But it's not there now.

715
01:11:14,993 --> 01:11:19,225
Cartoons for children.

716
01:11:19,264 --> 01:11:21,858
Where I'm from, men have to work.

717
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:23,765
Look, I'll work hard.

718
01:11:23,835 --> 01:11:27,498
The disregard that so many of you
have for practical matters,

719
01:11:27,539 --> 01:11:32,101
it's... beautiful.

720
01:11:32,176 --> 01:11:34,303
I think we should
all have some fun. Huh?

721
01:11:36,247 --> 01:11:39,307
Gadgets.
You call them "toys for boys."

722
01:11:40,852 --> 01:11:42,615
I have a gadget.

723
01:11:42,687 --> 01:11:46,555
- Would you like to play with it?
- Uh... No, no. I...

724
01:11:46,591 --> 01:11:50,994
It wants to play with you!

725
01:12:04,642 --> 01:12:05,904
Need to talk to you.

726
01:12:05,944 --> 01:12:07,935
Any idea where
I might find your friend?

727
01:12:07,979 --> 01:12:10,607
He's not who you think he is.

728
01:12:10,648 --> 01:12:12,479
Excuse me?

729
01:12:17,956 --> 01:12:19,548
<i>The Paradise Sheriff's Department</i>

730
01:12:19,591 --> 01:12:21,286
<i>raided the home of two suspects,</i>

731
01:12:21,326 --> 01:12:24,090
<i>seizing computers
and several suspicious items.</i>

732
01:12:24,128 --> 01:12:27,461
<i>An APB has been issued on
the suspects and anyone with...</i>

733
01:12:30,935 --> 01:12:32,459
We need to get out of here.

734
01:12:34,238 --> 01:12:35,933
There's a news thing.

735
01:12:35,974 --> 01:12:39,137
The cops think you and Henri
are criminals or terrorists.

736
01:12:49,887 --> 01:12:51,479
We're going back.

737
01:12:54,692 --> 01:12:56,660
I'm outside of
the home here in Warsaw

738
01:12:56,694 --> 01:12:59,857
where the mutilated bodies of
two paranormal website operators

739
01:12:59,931 --> 01:13:01,956
were just found a few hours ago.

740
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,797
The police are not saying
if they have any leads

741
01:13:03,835 --> 01:13:06,201
or even why these
brutal murders occurred.

742
01:13:06,270 --> 01:13:08,602
Police have no suspects
at this time...

743
01:13:19,317 --> 01:13:20,807
- I have one of those!
- What?

744
01:13:20,852 --> 01:13:23,616
One of those.
I took it from my dad's stash.

745
01:13:23,655 --> 01:13:25,850
- I need you to get it.
- Yeah, yeah.

746
01:13:25,923 --> 01:13:29,415
Let me off at Linndale.
Sarah's at a house up there.

747
01:13:29,494 --> 01:13:31,428
I'll call you after.

748
01:13:31,496 --> 01:13:33,862
- And then what?
- Then I get the rock and you go home.

749
01:13:44,909 --> 01:13:47,036
- It's him.
- John?

750
01:13:47,645 --> 01:13:50,978
- Did you see that?
- What's he doing here?

751
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:53,676
Yeah, he's here.

752
01:13:58,423 --> 01:13:59,583
That's him!

753
01:14:15,973 --> 01:14:17,600
Come on.

754
01:14:19,110 --> 01:14:20,270
Come on.

755
01:14:43,201 --> 01:14:45,692
Doesn't seem like your kind of crowd.

756
01:14:48,606 --> 01:14:51,769
Not so sure who my
kind of crowd is right now.

757
01:14:51,809 --> 01:14:54,403
- Look, just...
- John Smith?

758
01:14:54,445 --> 01:14:56,379
I'm such an idiot.

759
01:14:57,749 --> 01:15:00,980
And they're saying that your dad
is some kind of terrorist.

760
01:15:01,052 --> 01:15:03,179
He's not a terrorist.

761
01:15:03,788 --> 01:15:05,187
Tell me the truth.

762
01:15:06,157 --> 01:15:08,387
Who are you?

763
01:15:18,836 --> 01:15:20,098
He's upstairs.

764
01:15:20,938 --> 01:15:22,735
All right, guys, out of the way.

765
01:15:24,709 --> 01:15:26,939
You didn't answer my question.

766
01:15:27,812 --> 01:15:29,439
I just came to say goodbye.

767
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:31,448
- John, wait! What are you... No, John!
- Don't move!

768
01:15:31,482 --> 01:15:33,882
Sarah!

769
01:15:43,094 --> 01:15:44,118
How...

770
01:15:44,162 --> 01:15:45,629
- Move! Move!
- Go!

771
01:16:01,312 --> 01:16:02,973
That was awesome!

772
01:16:03,014 --> 01:16:06,450
Whoa...

773
01:16:12,089 --> 01:16:13,989
What you did is not possible.

774
01:16:14,025 --> 01:16:15,549
Who I am...

775
01:16:15,626 --> 01:16:17,594
...it's all in here.
I took these for you.

776
01:16:17,662 --> 01:16:21,393
Wait. Come with me.
Please.

777
01:16:22,333 --> 01:16:24,699
Any idea where they'd be?

778
01:16:24,769 --> 01:16:27,203
I think I know
where she might go.

779
01:16:37,248 --> 01:16:40,684
- Who the hell are they?
- Big-ass linebackers?

780
01:16:48,993 --> 01:16:51,188
Holy shit...

781
01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:56,962
No, no, no!

782
01:16:59,670 --> 01:17:00,762
Dad!

783
01:17:13,251 --> 01:17:17,085
An alcohol-fuelled
young guy like you...

784
01:17:17,154 --> 01:17:20,988
...healthy and well-fed.

785
01:17:21,058 --> 01:17:24,653
I bet you watch a lot of television,
don't you? Do you? Do you?

786
01:17:24,729 --> 01:17:26,924
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

787
01:17:26,964 --> 01:17:29,524
In this situation here,
you're probably thinking,

788
01:17:29,567 --> 01:17:32,764
"Maybe I could save the day.
Maybe I could be the hero."

789
01:17:32,837 --> 01:17:37,069
But I say... don't do that.

790
01:17:37,108 --> 01:17:38,803
OK?

791
01:17:40,511 --> 01:17:43,742
Tell me now, where is the boy?

792
01:18:11,309 --> 01:18:13,834
These are beautiful.

793
01:18:28,459 --> 01:18:29,983
Can you show me?

794
01:18:57,822 --> 01:19:00,188
- No!
- Get in!

795
01:19:04,395 --> 01:19:07,887
Let me go! Let me go!

796
01:19:12,670 --> 01:19:13,898
Let go of me!

797
01:19:21,479 --> 01:19:23,379
- Hello?
- Where are you?

798
01:19:23,414 --> 01:19:24,506
I'm at the high school.

799
01:19:24,548 --> 01:19:26,311
<i>Yeah, you need to get out of there now.</i>

800
01:19:26,350 --> 01:19:27,374
Why? What's happening?

801
01:19:27,418 --> 01:19:30,216
Your stunt with the car
is already on YouTube.

802
01:19:30,287 --> 01:19:31,686
<i>If they're not right on your ass now,</i>

803
01:19:31,722 --> 01:19:33,451
<i>they will be soon.</i>

804
01:19:34,025 --> 01:19:35,390
Come on.

805
01:19:35,426 --> 01:19:37,587
And don't tell me this is not my fight.

806
01:19:37,661 --> 01:19:42,098
My dad probably knew those guys were
coming and that's why they took him.

807
01:19:42,733 --> 01:19:45,725
And also, I have your dog.

808
01:19:46,570 --> 01:19:47,730
<i>Look, I'm on my way.</i>

809
01:19:47,772 --> 01:19:49,262
<i>I'll meet you out front of the school.</i>

810
01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:51,205
<i>You've got to get out now.</i>

811
01:19:51,776 --> 01:19:53,368
<i>John?</i>

812
01:19:53,411 --> 01:19:54,469
<i>John!</i>

813
01:19:59,116 --> 01:20:00,447
Let's go.

814
01:20:04,021 --> 01:20:07,252
Let go of me!

815
01:20:11,228 --> 01:20:13,753
Jesus!

816
01:20:13,798 --> 01:20:17,598
Sarah! If you're in there, run!

817
01:20:17,668 --> 01:20:20,398
Run!

818
01:20:23,941 --> 01:20:26,910
Let me go!

819
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:35,651
Listen to me. I'm not gonna
let them hurt you, OK?

820
01:20:35,719 --> 01:20:38,381
Do you understand me?
Come on.

821
01:21:52,163 --> 01:21:55,155
Lt'd be a good idea, cowboy, if you
kept your heroics off the Internet.

822
01:21:57,501 --> 01:22:01,733
- Who are you?
- Number Six. Where's your protector?

823
01:22:01,805 --> 01:22:05,206
- Dead.
- Yeah. Mine, too.

824
01:22:05,242 --> 01:22:06,675
Mogs got her four months ago.

825
01:22:06,710 --> 01:22:09,270
- We've been tracking them down.
- Tracking them?

826
01:22:09,346 --> 01:22:11,576
Yeah. Lucky for you, I saved your ass.

827
01:22:11,649 --> 01:22:13,879
You should be watching your own ass.

828
01:22:13,918 --> 01:22:16,216
Mogs have all the exits covered.

829
01:22:16,253 --> 01:22:19,245
Looks like you're gonna
have to fight to get out.

830
01:22:19,323 --> 01:22:21,553
- Are you game?
- Yeah.

831
01:22:21,592 --> 01:22:24,026
There's a tunnel under the school
that leads to the stadium.

832
01:22:24,061 --> 01:22:26,825
Oh, you made friends.
How nice.

833
01:22:28,899 --> 01:22:30,196
Let's go.

834
01:22:31,468 --> 01:22:34,062
Got any other legacies
I should know about?

835
01:22:34,138 --> 01:22:35,696
Stay tuned.

836
01:23:07,871 --> 01:23:10,339
Oh, shit.

837
01:23:17,781 --> 01:23:19,214
Oh, shit!

838
01:23:28,959 --> 01:23:30,790
Careful, they'll see us.

839
01:23:32,096 --> 01:23:33,996
And you're going
to need all your energy.

840
01:23:38,102 --> 01:23:41,094
- What was that?
- They're comin'.

841
01:23:41,138 --> 01:23:43,606
Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

842
01:23:43,641 --> 01:23:46,132
Whoa! Sam, what are you doing?

843
01:23:46,210 --> 01:23:47,575
Did you see what just
flew out of that truck?

844
01:23:47,611 --> 01:23:49,806
And your dog just shape-shifted
into one of them.

845
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:53,008
I thought he was gonna eat me.
Here's your rock.

846
01:23:55,085 --> 01:23:59,021
Hi! I'm Sam. What's your name?

847
01:24:00,024 --> 01:24:01,252
Jane Doe.

848
01:24:01,292 --> 01:24:02,589
That's cool. It's cool.

849
01:24:02,626 --> 01:24:03,991
So, are you a number, too?

850
01:24:04,028 --> 01:24:07,020
- Who is this tool?
- Sam, focus.

851
01:24:07,097 --> 01:24:09,657
What flew out of the truck?

852
01:24:13,771 --> 01:24:16,331
Come on! Go, go!

853
01:24:16,373 --> 01:24:19,672
Sam. Come on! Go!

854
01:24:23,947 --> 01:24:25,710
Come on! Come on!

855
01:24:28,819 --> 01:24:31,151
Come on!

856
01:25:31,181 --> 01:25:32,273
Ahh!

857
01:25:39,923 --> 01:25:42,255
- Hit me.
- What?

858
01:25:42,326 --> 01:25:44,726
With your lumen.
I need to power-up.

859
01:25:46,930 --> 01:25:48,295
Hit me!

860
01:25:59,276 --> 01:26:01,107
Red Bull's for pussies.

861
01:26:03,447 --> 01:26:05,574
He killed Henri. I want him.

862
01:26:37,281 --> 01:26:40,341
Ah!

863
01:26:42,152 --> 01:26:43,551
Four!

864
01:26:55,766 --> 01:26:57,859
You're good with your hands.

865
01:26:57,935 --> 01:26:59,903
- Thanks.
- No problem.

866
01:27:01,405 --> 01:27:05,705
- My dog, he, uh... he just...
- Yeah, he's a chimera.

867
01:27:05,776 --> 01:27:07,903
He came with you from Lorien.

868
01:27:07,978 --> 01:27:10,378
Someone had to look after you.

869
01:28:13,477 --> 01:28:15,570
You brought a gun?
Are you serious?

870
01:28:15,612 --> 01:28:18,046
- What? It might come in handy.
- This way.

871
01:28:28,759 --> 01:28:29,783
Go!

872
01:28:38,769 --> 01:28:40,396
- Take her back to the tunnel!
- Got it! Come on!

873
01:28:47,744 --> 01:28:49,974
- Holy...!
- Ahh!

874
01:28:54,585 --> 01:28:55,882
I play a lot of Xbox.

875
01:29:02,192 --> 01:29:03,216
Oh!

876
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:25,641
Oh! Ahh!

877
01:30:35,485 --> 01:30:39,751
Number Four, I think you
have something I need. Hm?

878
01:30:41,358 --> 01:30:45,727
Oh, thank you for making
this so nice and easy.

879
01:30:45,762 --> 01:30:51,029
Think of how quickly we'll finish off
the rest of the planet. It's fantastic!

880
01:30:51,768 --> 01:30:54,396
Soon, I'll be done with all of you.

881
01:30:54,438 --> 01:30:56,702
Just relax.

882
01:30:58,108 --> 01:31:01,874
You can't stop what's coming.
You never could.

883
01:31:01,912 --> 01:31:04,005
You have...

884
01:31:04,047 --> 01:31:06,481
...no idea...

885
01:31:07,684 --> 01:31:09,151
...what I'm capable of.

886
01:31:25,402 --> 01:31:26,699
Ah!

887
01:32:23,627 --> 01:32:24,821
John.

888
01:32:28,098 --> 01:32:29,793
Fireproof?

889
01:32:30,967 --> 01:32:33,333
I told you to stay tuned.

890
01:33:02,232 --> 01:33:04,359
All right, give me that.
Come on.

891
01:33:05,235 --> 01:33:06,463
Thank you.

892
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:41,493
Oh. Well, that was disappointing.
So, not a tracking device?

893
01:33:41,538 --> 01:33:43,597
No, it was.

894
01:33:43,673 --> 01:33:46,073
- Did you feel that, too?
- Yeah.

895
01:33:46,142 --> 01:33:49,305
- We know where we need to go.
- Yeah, we can find the others.

896
01:33:55,552 --> 01:33:58,749
- Here.
- Thank you.

897
01:33:59,723 --> 01:34:01,588
I hope this doesn't get you in trouble.

898
01:34:01,625 --> 01:34:06,119
Nah. Stuff goes missing from evidence
all the time.

899
01:34:06,196 --> 01:34:08,596
My dad won't even know.

900
01:34:08,632 --> 01:34:11,533
- You want to be heading west now.
- Why?

901
01:34:11,568 --> 01:34:14,059
Because I told my dad you're going east.

902
01:34:21,978 --> 01:34:25,880
- Six, Sam's coming with us.
- What?

903
01:34:26,983 --> 01:34:28,746
- No way.
- He's one of us now.

904
01:34:28,785 --> 01:34:31,015
We need to find his father.

905
01:34:34,624 --> 01:34:38,025
You slow us down,
I'll shoot you myself.

906
01:34:38,094 --> 01:34:40,562
And I believe you.
Could we go now?

907
01:34:46,536 --> 01:34:48,663
You know, I wouldn't leave
if it wasn't, uh...

908
01:34:48,738 --> 01:34:51,502
- Safer.
- Yeah.

909
01:34:51,574 --> 01:34:53,132
I know.

910
01:34:54,344 --> 01:34:56,812
Really sorry about
what happened with Henri.

911
01:34:58,081 --> 01:34:59,844
Me, too.

912
01:35:03,219 --> 01:35:05,710
You know I'll find you again.

913
01:35:08,024 --> 01:35:11,016
Probably still be here.

914
01:35:12,228 --> 01:35:13,820
It's the people that make the place.

915
01:35:14,597 --> 01:35:16,929
- Right?
- Yeah.

916
01:35:23,273 --> 01:35:27,141
Henri warned me that
we only fall for one person.

917
01:35:29,346 --> 01:35:30,813
Ever?

918
01:35:31,648 --> 01:35:33,081
Ever.

919
01:37:05,875 --> 01:37:08,776
<i>This is the first town
I've left without Henri.</i>

920
01:37:09,712 --> 01:37:13,170
<i>But it's also the first one
I have a reason to come back to.</i>

921
01:37:14,551 --> 01:37:18,043
<i>Henri was right,
we're stronger together.</i>

922
01:37:18,588 --> 01:37:21,182
<i>So we will find the others.</i>

923
01:37:23,426 --> 01:37:28,056
<i>My planet is called Lorien,
but Earth is my home now.</i>

924
01:37:29,099 --> 01:37:32,796
<i>It's as good a place
as any in the universe.</i>

925
01:37:32,836 --> 01:37:35,270
<i>And that's how it's going to stay.</i>
