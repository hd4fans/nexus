3
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:03,467
你知道 这样骑让你看起来很绝望
You know, showboating like that just makes you look desperate.

4
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:07,269
是啊 “看看我 我还能反转一圈勒”真可笑
Yeah, "Look at me. I can flip my ski." Pathetic.

5
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,401
- 是啊 - 丹尼尔 刚刚真棒！

00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,644
嘿 丹尼尔 妮可 走了吗？
Hey, Daniel, Nicole left, huh?

8
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,814
你应该让我跟他讲讲话的
Should've let me talk to her.

9
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,800
妮可：去游泳如何？去5号码头见我

10
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,493
哇哦！
Whoo-hoo!

11
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,093
我真爱这个地方
I love it out here.

12
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:46,078
北斗七星 是我的最爱
The Big Dipper. It's my favorite.

13
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:49,742
- 你知道吗？ - 不知道
- Do you know that one? - No.

14
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,546
我天文学才考了D (50～60分)
I got a D in Astronomy.

15
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:59,557
我从来都没看过你跟其他人(女生)再一起
So, I never see you with anyone.

16
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:03,026
还是你有女朋友吗？在外县市？
Do you have a girlfriend out of town or something?

17
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:12,095
丹尼尔？ 丹尼尔？
Daniel? Daniel?

18
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:22,042
我要让你察觉这个！
I want you to feel this!

19
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,784
你接下来所要面对的
This is what's coming for you.

20
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,115
丹尼尔 你还好吗？
Daniel, are you OK?

21
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,918
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

22
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,929
他是个怪物 他是个怪物…
He's a freak. He's some kind of freak.

23
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:29,942
三号 已经死了
Number Three's dead.

24
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:33,951
你还好吗？
You all right?

25
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:37,820
- 还好 - 有其他人看到发生什么事吗？
- Yeah. - Anyone else see what happened?

26
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:22,366
我已经告诉你不要带这个 这只会拖延我们的时间
I told you not to keep this crap. It just slows us down.

27
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:50,957
好吧 我们出发
All right, let's go.

28
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,938
丹尼尔
Daniel.

29
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:10,879
这一部份就是我最讨厌的 搬家(逃避)…
This is the part I hate the most, the running.

30
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:14,182
但它是唯一在我的生活里最真实的
But it's the only thing in my life that's real.

31
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,051
其余的 都不真实
The rest is a lie.

32
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:18,283
即使是 亨利
Even Henri.

33
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:20,257
大家都以为他是我父亲
People think he's my father.

34
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,920
但他不是
He's not.

35
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:26,523
他是从我们的星球派来的一位战士 指派来保护我的生命
He's a warrior from my planet, assigned to keep me alive.

36
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,063
我不记得我的父亲
I don't remember my father.

37
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:33,265
他所留给我的只有一个很奇怪的盒子
All he left for me was some kind of box.

38
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:36,070
亨利说 当时机对的时候 他会把它(盒子)交给我
Henri says he'll pass it on to me when the time is right.

39
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,872
我的第一个伤疤是在我9岁那年
I got my first scar when I was nine years old,

40
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,439
靠近墨西哥边境
near the border of Mexico.

41
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:47,281
让我从睡梦中惊醒
It woke me from my sleep.

42
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,347
这是第一个莫嘎多里安人发现我们在地球上信号
It was the first sign that the Mogadorians had found us here on Earth.

43
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:55,126
我第二个伤疤是在12岁发生的
The second scar came when I was 12.

44
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:58,493
在科罗拉多州 在场拼音考试中…
I was in Colorado, in the middle of a spelling bee.

45
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:02,696
当我感受到… 我就知道二号死了…
As soon as I felt it, I knew Number Two was dead.

46
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,700
昨晚 我得到了我的第三个疤
Last night, I got my third scar.

47
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:14,311
莫嘎多里安人入侵我的星球时[洛林]那时我只是个小孩
I was just a kid when the Mogadorians invaded my planet, Lorien.

48
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,815
我们9个小孩逃跑了
Nine of us children escaped.

49
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:21,319
我们有天赋 当我长大后 要保护我们的人民
We were gifted, meant to protect our people when we grew up.

50
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:25,051
但在还没有机会之前 大家都被杀了
We never got the chance. Everyone was killed.

51
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,159
我们是星球中 最后的生存者
We are the last of our kind.

52
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:33,460
但已经有3个人死亡了…
Three of us are gone. Dead.

53
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:36,730
它们将一个接一个的把我们杀了
They are hunting us down, one by one, in order.

54
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,334
我知道下一个就是我
I know I'm next.

55
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,507
我是第四号
I am Number Four.

56
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:44,873
好吧 所以…
All right, well, so...

57
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,845
丹尼尔 其余的学期 不会在学校
Daniel won't be in school the rest of the semester.

58
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:50,381
好的 你也是…
OK. You, too.

59
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:53,750
你新的身分
Your new ID.

60
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:59,024
还有这一次 避开麻烦 不要上课 不要组队 什么都不要…
And this time, you stay out of sight, huh? No school, no teams, nothing.

61
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,049
约翰・史密斯 装得很像
John Smith. Very original.

62
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:04,290
我不想装得很像 我希望能不被看见
I don't want to be original. I want to be invisible.

63
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,295
这次不一样
This time was different.

64
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,327
我不单只有一个伤疤
I didn't just get a scar.

65
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,965
我 恩… 我看见三号
I, uh... I saw Number Three.

66
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:20,706
我感觉的到刀 感觉的到他死 我们大家都可以感觉到
I felt the knife, I felt him die. I could tell we all did.

67
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:25,314
- 其他人 - 我们要开始行动了
- The others. - We should get moving.

68
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,013
莫嘎多里安人可能已经察觉你的气味
Mogadorians could've already picked up our scent.

69
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:33,121
我们要去天堂 我那边有事情要处理…
We're going to Paradise. I have business to take care of.

70
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:42,953
他是 伯尼・考萨尔
It's Bernie Kosar.

71
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,397
玩美式足球的
Played football.

72
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:54,266
- 是啊 他效力于克里夫兰 - 好的知道
- Yeah, he played for Cleveland. - Hm. Good to know.

73
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:57,070
- 下次 让我来选地方 - 是啊
- Next time, I get to pick the place. - Yeah.

74
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:31,536
全部在这… 我要去睡觉了…
That's all of it. I'm going to bed.

75
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,205
喔 等一下… 我需要一张新照片…
Ooh. Hang on. I need a new picture.

76
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:39,006
我们需要清空网路流传的东西
We have to wipe out anything that hits the Internet.

77
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:42,383
说 “天堂”
Say "Paradise."

78
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,484
喔 该死
Oh, shit.

79
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,723
这就是为什么我要把你消失为无形
This is why I need you to be invisible.

80
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,286
回房子里
Get back inside.

81
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:27,597
约翰
John.

82
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:31,193
快 快进来里面
Come on. Come back inside.

83
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:43,909
它是莫嘎多里安人也太小了吧 你不觉得吗？
Little small for a Mogadorian, don't you think?

84
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:48,116
我确定它是别人养的狗
I'm sure he belongs to someone.

85
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:51,281
它并没任何狗圈跟标志…
He doesn't have any collar or tags.

86
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,917
你的主人在某个地方 一定很想你吗？
Hm. Somebody, somewhere, must miss you, huh?

87
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,328
怎样…
Come on.

88
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,093
多了一双眼睛 耳朵 帮忙顾家…
Another pair of eyes and ears watching the house?

89
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:05,133
- 而且我也需要聊天的伴 - 跟我聊啊
- I'm gonna need somebody to talk to. - Talk to me.

90
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:09,439
是啊 让你养吧
Yeah, keep the dog.

91
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:10,907
要帮它取什么名子呢？
What are you gonna call him?

92
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:15,246
取伯尼・考萨尔呢？
How about Bernie Kosar?

93
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
（天堂谷新闻：钢铁工人马尔科姆・斯贝尔曼仍然下落不明）

94
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,207
你出来干嘛？
What are you doing up?

95
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,871
我改变主意了
I changed my mind.

96
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,779
什么东西？
About what?

97
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,910
听着 在你左右真的很无聊
Look, uh, as much fun as you are to be around,

98
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:04,013
我没办法当犯人 我一定要去上学
I can't be a prisoner. Uh, I have to go to school.

99
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:06,081
- 不 不可能 太冒险了 - 拜托
- No. No way, too risky. - Come on.

100
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,683
三号也是完全与外界脱离而Mogs干掉他了
Number Three was completely off the grid and the Mogs got him.

101
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,251
- 但也保不住他 - 嗯啊
- Didn't save him. - Mm-mm.

102
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:13,890
拜托 如果我融入团体 这样才会更安全
Come on. I'm gonna be safer if I blend in.

103
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,433
我保证 我一定保持低调
I promise I'll keep a low profile.

104
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,662
听着 即使我让你去 也很难行的通
Look. Even if I let you, and I'm not,

105
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,933
你不可能就这样直接去学校上课而不被发现…
you can't just waltz into school and start class...

106
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:22,599
你该不会以为你是唯一会伪造文件的人吧？
Do you think you're the only one who can forge documents?

107
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,344
你有那个…？
Hm. Do you have a...?

108
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,006
5天的粮食 换洗衣服 GPS 现金
Five days of rations, spare clothes, GPS, cash.

109
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:31,711
- 你叫什么名子？ - 约翰・史密斯
- What's your name? - John Smith.

110
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,274
- 你是哪里人？ - 多伦多
- Where are you from? - Toronto.

111
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,252
你的皮肤看起来棕褐色的… 不像多伦多来的
You seem kind of tan for Toronto.

112
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,484
圣菲 新墨西哥 我知道台词 好不好？
Santa Fe, New Mexico. I know the drill, OK?

113
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,453
这个你留着 我每隔一个小时就会打电话给你
You keep this on you. I'll call you every hour.

114
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,123
如果你不接 我就知道可能发生事情了
If you don't pick up, I know something's wrong.

115
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:50,396
- 拜托 每个小时？ - 就是这样 不然你就请家教好了！
- Come on, every hour? - That, or you can home school.

116
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,461
然后家教老师就是我
And I'll be your teacher.

117
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:54,970
好啦
Fine.

118
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,942
嘿 约翰 不要像个白痴 保持低调点
Hey, John, don't be stupid. You keep your head down.

119
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:00,387
我知道如何融入
I know how to blend in.

120
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,467
好了 请坐
OK, doll. Take a seat.

121
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,971
我帮你列印你的时间表 马上回来
I'll just print up your schedule. Back in a jiffy.

122
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,470
我知道她是明星摄影师
I know she's the star photographer,

123
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,411
但这样对其他学生不公平
but it's not fair to the other students.

124
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,107
她把重要的耗材都要用光了…
She's using up all the vital supplies.

125
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:39,982
埃默里 听着 “天堂里的陌生人” 至少她很有创意
Emory, come on. "Strangers in Paradise." At least she's creative.

126
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,543
她的网站上的图片是完全不适当的
The pictures on her website are totally inappropriate.

127
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:46,113
贝尔门先生 如果你想保留这些照片 你可以直说就好
Mr. Behrman, if you want to keep the photos, you should just say so.

128
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,558
保留这些照片吗？他们已经传偏了网络了！
Keep the photos? They're already all over the Internet!

129
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,994
你这样没经过别人的同意就上传到网络上是非常没礼貌的
It's a violation to post things like this without people's permission.

130
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,361
你必须阻止…
You have to do something about this.

131
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,866
贝尔曼先生 失陪几分钟 好吗？
Mr. Behrman, excuse us for a few minutes, OK?

132
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:06,843
莎拉 这不像你
Sarah, this is not like you.

133
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,313
是不是有什么事？
Is there something going on?

134
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:12,249
- 一切都很好 - 莎拉？
- Everything's fine. - Sarah?

135
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,309
- 真的啊 - 坐吧
- Honestly. - Have a seat.

136
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:19,487
你不能让少数坏学生来影响你
You can't let a few negative students get you down.

137
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:23,325
听着 我并不想看你孤零零的跟学校托解
Look, I don't want you to isolate yourself from the rest of the school.

138
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:28,390
- 你应该享受这一年 - 好吧 我试试吧
- You should enjoy this year. - OK, I'll try.

139
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:31,561
- 非常好 - 请把相机还回来？
- Good. - Can I please have my camera back?

140
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:35,266
没有老师和学生的许可 不要再乱上传照片到你的网站 
No more photos on your website without teacher and student permission.

141
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,035
好的
OK.

142
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,804
这里是你的时间表
Here's your schedule.

143
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:46,045
主班为微积分学 B-WING第七间…
Homeroom is calculus. That's B-wing, room seven...

144
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:51,886
哦 莎拉！你能不能带我们的朋友到他的内务柜？他是从圣达菲来的
Oh, Sarah! Could you show our friend to his locker? He's from Santa Fe.

145
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:56,418

Job fair starts tomorrow. Everybody, job fair starts tomorrow.

146
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:59,589
你用什么样的相机？
What kind of camera do you use?

147
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,865
偷听？这样不会让你交到新朋友
Eavesdropping? That's not gonna win you friends.

148
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:04,528
- 看那边 - 什么？
- Check it out. - What?

149
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,704
那你帮我转告校长 办公室的隔音太差了
Tell that to the principal with a fish tank for an office.

150
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,933
不听到也很难…
It's kind of hard not to hear.

151
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:17,443
不好意识 其实学校隔音都很差
Sorry. This whole place is kind of a fish tank.

152
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,908
嗯… 走廊走下去就是第7室了
Well... Room seven is down the hall,

153
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,581
然后 呃 你的内务柜在那里
and, uh, that's your locker right there.

154
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:28,652

157
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:37,732
好的 你不想告诉我你的名字
OK. You don't want to tell me your name.

158
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:38,793
没关系
That's fine.

159
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:49,147
这真是我的名字 约翰・史密斯
That's really my name. John Smith.

160
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,950
嘿 你好 您是新来的？

Good to meet you, John. Where are you from?

164

165
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,003
在哪 都玩什么球类？
Play any ball out there?

166
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:17,633
- 足球？ - 是啊
- Football? - Yeah.

167
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:20,270
- 没有 - 都没玩吗？

168
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,473
棒球？足球吗？乒乓球？
Baseball? Soccer? Ping-pong?

169
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:24,981
没有
Nope.

170
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:28,612
好的 不 没有关系 真的没关系
OK. No, that's cool, man. That's totally cool.

171
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:30,622
多一个帮手也不错 对吧？
We could always use more boosters in the stands, right?

172
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:34,956
听好 你如果需要什么 你要问我们 好吗？
Listen. You need anything, you ask us, OK?

173
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:38,019
- 我们罩着你 - 我会记住的
- We got you. - I'll keep that in mind.

174
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:42,590
聊天愉快 大家伙
Good talking to you, big guy.

175
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:44,633
看看这是谁…？
Look who it is.

176
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,865
小心点啊…！
Watch out, man.

177
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:48,530
对不起 山姆
Sorry, Sam.

178
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:52,543
废物！
Loser!

179
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,207
等等我 白吃！
Wait up, fool.

180
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:57,543
谢谢
Thanks.

181
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,910
一定要爱第一流的…
Gotta love the classics.

182
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,750
国王与校友… 科学的… 书呆子…
Homecoming king versus the science nerd.

183
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,815
这样能让时间好过一点…
Just get better with time, don't they?

184
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:11,351
- 那家伙 马克 他… - 不久就无关紧要了
- That guy, Mark, he's... - Soon to be irrelevant.

185
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:13,887
今年是他的第三年 也是他人生中最威风的四年而已…
He's in the third year of the best four years of his life.

186
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:20,624
所以 她很像“太阳能系统 太阳不围绕地球”
So, she was like, "The solar system's sun does not revolve around the Earth."

187
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,633
""最好是啦""
I said, "Yeah, right."

188
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,935
嘿 斯波克！
Hey, Spock!

189
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:29,769
- 击中了吧！- 当心！飞碟 兄弟！
- Nailed it! - Heads up! UFO, brother!

190
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:32,140
喔那一定很痛
That had to hurt.

191
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,939
嘿 躺在那就好了啦
Hey, stay down, man. Just stay down.

192
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:35,172
他要哭了 他要哭了…
He's gonna cry. He's gonna cry.

193
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,715
- 哦 他妈妈来了耶…！ - 哦…
- Oh, Mommy's coming! - Oh...

194
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:42,315
- 正击中脸耶 - 嘿 你没事吧？
- Right in the face. - Hey, are you OK?

195
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:46,289
- 混蛋 - 哟 新来的！帮个忙？
- Assholes. - Yo, new dude! Little help?

196
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:58,068
天啊！
Jesus!

197
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,230
我没事！ 放开我…
I'm fine! Get off me.

198
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:02,068
干嘛这样啊！
Come on, man!

199
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,098
- 你还好吧？ - 不
- You OK? - No.

200
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:10,507
你手臂的力量还真大
That's quite an arm you got there.

201
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:13,415
是啊 天晓得？
Yeah. Who knew?

202
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,786
那么 什么外星人的事情？
So, uh, what's with the UFO thing?

203
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:20,889
我知道今天是你的第1天
I know it's your first day and all,

204
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,553
但 早晚你都知道的
but, uh, sooner or later you'll figure it out.

205
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:25,755
知道什么啊？
Figure what out?

206
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:29,366
我绝对不配当你的朋友
I'm definitely not the guy you want to hang with.

207
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:27,215
低调？
Invisible.

208
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:29,227
我说的话你有记清楚吗？
You heard me when I said that, right?

209
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
第四号没有死在这儿

210
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:33,357
是啊 因为如果我没记错的话 我不是在对空气讲话
Yeah. Yeah, because I remember you being there.

211
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:22,278
让我们面对现实 不要有恐惧 我们时代的残酷
Let us face, without panic, the reality of our times.

212
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,214
事实上 原子弹…
The fact that atom bombs

213
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:28,447
也许某一天会掉在我们的城市 所以我们要随时准备好…
may, some day, be dropped on our cities. And let us prepare for survival

214
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,545
并了解武器对我们的威胁
by understanding the weapon that threatens us.

215
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:31,613
是啊
Yeah.

216
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:41,320
你适应得如何啊 兄弟？
How you settling in, bro?

217
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:45,627
- 很好 谢谢 - 非常好
- Fine, thanks. - Good. That's good.

218
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:49,037
我看你和史巴克成为了好朋友啊
I see you and Spock are vibing.

219
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,041
没想到怪物也有感性的一面 是吧？
Got a bit of a soft spot for freaks, do you?

220
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,838
谁在讲话？
Who's talking?

221
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:57,848
哎呀
Yikes.

222
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:01,909
听着 你是个可崇拜的年轻人
Look. It's cute, it really is. You are an adorable young man.

223
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,148
但 这样刺激到我
But I find it irritating,

224
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:06,349
所以保持低调 知道吗？
so keep it on the bleachers, OK?

225
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:08,517
- 好 - 非常好
- All right. - Good. That's good.

226
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,254
还有 有我在这的日子
Also, while I'm here,

227
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,922
我给你一个建议
I'm gonna let you in on a little tip.

228
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:31,210
找一个适合自己的地方 其余的就交给我 好吗？
Find your place fast. Catch the rest of this flick, OK?

229
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:33,375
天啊 兄弟 你全身湿透了
Jesus, dude. You are soaking wet.

230
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,906
约翰 起来吧 来吧 我们得走了
John, get up. Come on. We gotta go.

231
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:06,007
约翰
John.

232
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:08,576
- 约翰 - 我的手 什么…？
- John. - My hands. What...?

233
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:10,917
- 亨利 我的手好痛！ - 约翰…
- Henri. My hands burn! - John...

234
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:12,923
- 看着我放松 - 我到底发生什么事？
- Look at me and relax. - What's happening to me?

235
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:14,549
这在家乡叫做遗传能力
They called them legacies back home.

236
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:17,254
9人之中… 都有这样的能力…
You, the nine, you're the only ones who have them.

237
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:18,659
- 遗传能力？ - 是得 没错
- Legacies? - That's right.

238
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,722
你的父母是洛林派成员
Your parents were members of the Lorien Garde.

239
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:23,256
你继承了他们的能力 天赋
You've inherited their abilities. Gifts.

240
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:24,460
- 天赋？ - 是的
- Gifts? - That's right.

241
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,333
我的手看起来像照明灯
My hands light up like road flares.

242
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,931
- 你说这叫做天赋？ - 每个遗传者有自己的功能
- And you call that a gift? - Each legacy has its own function.

243
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:31,032
接下来还会发生什么事？
There's... There's more coming?

244
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:35,740
深呼吸 当你集中注意力 你会学会控制它们
As you breathe and focus, you're gonna learn to control them.

245
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,682
- 好的 好的 - 就像这样…
- OK. OK. - Just like you're doing, right now.

246
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,050
好吗？
OK?

247
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:44,414
你觉得你的手怎么样？
How do your hands feel?

248
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:49,584
- 比较好了 - 很好
- Better. - Good.

249
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:52,953
那么现在要？
So, what now?

250
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,155
现在？
Now?

251
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:58,396
慢慢来 你会越来越强 越来越快
We wait. You're gonna keep growing stronger and faster.

252
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:00,165
所以我需要你注意安全
I need you to be careful.

253
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:03,299
现在 我需要你集中注意力 然后控助它
Right now, you have to focus your mind. Get some control.

254
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:05,467
当然学会如何控制 才能再回去学校上课…
When you can do that, you can get back to school.

255
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:08,137
我不希望引起怀疑 我在这还有事情没完成
I don't want to raise suspicion. I still have business here.

256
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:10,044
在此期间 你的力量只会引起注意
In the meantime, your powers will only draw attention.

257
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,413
随时注意自己 你明白吗？
You keep yourself in check, you understand?

258
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,044
所以 我有这些能力 但却又不能使用它们…
So I got all these powers, but I'm not allowed to use them?

259
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,280
没错
Exactly.

260
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:19,638
还没到感恩节就买这些还真早啊…
A little early for Thanksgiving.

261
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:22,269
纸 或 塑料？
Paper or plastic?

262
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:09,752
要往这边…
And you wind it here...

263
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,309
“天堂有陌生人”？
"Strangers in Paradise"?

264
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:36,445
我知道 附庸风雅 自命不凡
I know. Arty, pretentious.

265
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:38,682
嗯…这实际上并不是我想说的
Uh... That's not actually what I was gonna say.

266
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:42,055
我的网站只是需要一个名字 所以就发现它
I just needed a name for my website and it was right there.

267
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:48,129
他们应该把这个镇叫做“啼笑皆非”
You know, they should've called this town "Ironic."

268
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:51,192
具有讽刺意味 俄亥俄州？
Ironic, Ohio? Has a ring to it.

269
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:57,397
你怎么了？你看起来不一样 还是发生什么事
What's up with you? You look different, or something.

270
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,340
莎拉 过来！我有一辆新自行车！
Sarah, come over! I got a new bike!

271
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:02,005
好吧 下礼拜再去
OK, I will next week.

272
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:04,378
- 帮我拿一下 - 好的
- Hold this for a second. - All right.

273
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,508
喔 他们好可爱
Oh, they're so cute.

274
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:08,677
呃… 我说实话
You know, uh... I mean it.

275
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,312
呃… 你的照片…
Uh... Your photographs...

276
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:12,846
我父母叫我当保姆挣钱买胶卷
My parents make me babysit for film money,

277
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:17,054
所以就找他们两个好了
and those are two of my victims.

278
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:19,528
你知道 我 嗯…
You know, I'm, uh...

279
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:22,998
实际上 我想夸夸你 但是 嗯…
I'm actually trying to pay you a compliment, but, uh...

280
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,433
…但进行的不是很好
...it's not going so well.

281
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,060
喔
Oh.

282
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:30,037
好…嗯…
Right. Um...

283
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,370
谢谢你
Thank you.

284
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:38,714
我不知道 我只是感到 透过相机能看到真实的一面
I don't know, I just, um, see better through this thing.

285
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:43,679
这就像是我自己个人学士探测器
It's like my own personal BS detector.

286
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,218
来吧！让我们走吧！
Come on! Let's go!

287
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:51,261
请问 你是不是忘了什么东西？
Excuse me. Did you forget something? 

288
00:33:51,261 --> 00:33:53,229
你有两件事情要做 你知道吗？
 You had two things to do, you know?

289
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:55,458
- 锁门 关灯！ - 这就是山姆的爸爸吗？
- Lock the door and turn off the lights! - That's Sam's dad?

290
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,591
他的继父
His stepdad.

291
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:59,693
每天晚上都要我一直提醒你！
Every night it's the same thing with you!

292
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:06,476
我到了
This is it.

293
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:16,348
你住这边吗？
You live here?

294
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:20,022
对啊 我在这长大的
Yeah, I grew up here.

295
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:28,023
- 它只是普通的房子 - 我知道
- It's just a house. - I know.

296
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,932
你饿了吗？
You hungry?

297
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:38,305
那么 约翰几个星期前刚从圣达菲搬过来
So, John, just moved from Santa Fe a few weeks ago.

298
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:39,968
- 史密斯 对不对？ - 嗯 是的 先生

299
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:43,104
- 你的父亲是一个作家？ - 是的 他是
- And your father's a writer? - Yes, he is.

300
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:45,843
在这里 每个人都知道镇上的一切啊
Everybody really does know everything in this town.

301
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,442
哦 八卦传播的像病毒一样快
Oh, gossip spreads like Ebola.

302
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:49,783
问题的游戏！
Question game!

303
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:52,119
哦！对不起 我的错
Oh! Sorry, my bad.

304
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:54,283
- 好吧 大家把手机都放在篮子里 - 随你了
- All right, everybody, surrender them. - Here you go.

Hand them over.

307
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,727

- And you. - Mom?

308
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:03,733
晚餐后会还给他 晚餐后就会还给你
He'll get it back after dinner. You'll get it back after dinner.

309
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,328
- 谢谢你 约翰 没事的啦！ - 好的
- Thank you, John. See? It's fine. - All right.

310
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:10,738
圣达菲比较热闹 对不对？搬来这会很无聊吗？
So, Santa Fe's kind of hip, right? You bored silly here?

311
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,437
不会啦 春季嘉年华要到了！
Nah, not with the spring carnival coming up!

312
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:16,413
真的很有趣 你和你的家人一定要来
It's fun, and you and your folks should definitely come.

313
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,745
哦 只有我跟我爸而已…
Oh, it's just me and my dad.

314
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:20,808
那你妈呢？
Where's your mom?

315
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:22,444
- 嗯… 我…  - 妈
- Uh... My... - Mom.

316
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:26,981
没关系 我爸妈没有结婚…
No, it's fine. My dad and mom, uh, they didn't get married.

317
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:29,959
嗯…好啦…你一定要去看看…
Uh, you know, check it out. Carnival.

318
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:32,360
莎拉会在那拍很多照片…
Sarah will be there taking pictures for the paper.

319
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,522
随意拍拍而已
Cheap labor.

320
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:35,190
- 明明就很好 - 不
- That is not why. - No.

321
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:38,030
- 她是一个非常有才华的摄影师 - 问题游戏！
- She's a very talented photographer. - Question game!

322
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:41,162
好吧 小声点… 等等在玩…
OK. Keep your voice down, and we will play.

323
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:44,902
我们吃饭很传统 而且 我们从来不会装得很客套
It's a dinner tradition. Otherwise, we'd never talk about the good stuff.

324
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,341
是你听过最糟糕的吗？
Worst advice you ever got?

325
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:48,642
看看这个…
"Pull this."

326
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:49,907
拜托 停止！
Oh, stop!

327
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,573
很恶心耶…
That's really gross.

328
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,843
好啦…嗯…
OK, um...

329
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:55,148
而且你父母也不会发现你偷跑出来…
"Your parents will never know you're gone."

330
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:57,211
你爸妈也都不知道你偷跑去来… 所以她才会才这…
It worked with your folks. That's how she got here.

331
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:58,778
- 拜托 停 - 我的天啊
- Stop it. Stop. - Oh, my God.

332
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,791
- 什么？ - 好了 莎拉 轮到你了
- What? - OK, Sarah, your turn.

333
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:05,591
哦 我妈妈告诉我自晒看起来很自然
Oh. Mom telling me that self-tanner looks totally natural.

334
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,858
她变成橘色的…
She was orange.

335
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:10,367
看起来像交通锥形桶 而且毕业典礼拍照那天
Like a traffic cone. On picture day.

336
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:11,924
哦 你应该去拿照片出来
Oh, you should go get that picture.

337
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,231
- 照片还留着吗！ - 约翰 你一定会…
- We still have the picture! - John, you are gonna...

338
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:15,033
你干嘛不拿给他看…
Why would you want to show him that?

339
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:17,370
我真不该说这件事的…
I shouldn't have said it.

340
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:19,534
我很想把照片撕烂
I think I tore them up.

341
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:27,280
真不好意是啊…
Sorry about that.

342
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:32,513
- 关于什么？ - 我的父母
- About what? - My parents.

343
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:36,015
他们刚才一直在耍宝…
They were putting on the "aren't we cool?" show.

344
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,721
他们很以你为荣…
They seem very proud of you.

345
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:39,729
我知道而且他们一直在说服我…
Yeah, and they're already trying to convince me

346
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:42,095
去当地的社区大学 在代顿
to go to the local community college in Dayton.

347
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:45,226
他们很希望…我住在这边
They'd love it if I stayed here.

348
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:48,397
然后去婚纱摄影上班
Got into wedding photography.

349
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:51,441
那你想做的事？
What do you want to do?

350
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,377
这是我的最爱
That's my favorite.

351
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:58,939
它有曝光
It's got all these light leaks

352
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:02,076
这样的照片拍出来很有趣
so the photos come out so interesting.

353
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,950
在这里 我给你看
Here, I'll show you.

354
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:16,992
看到那边那张吗？
See that one right there?

355
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,968
这就是我说的那样…
That's what I was talking about.

356
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:22,333
这是什么？
What's this?

357
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:25,199
嗯…
Um...

358
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:32,211
实际上 这有点私人…
That is kind of private, actually.

359
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:35,881
真棒
It's amazing.

360
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:44,027
- 干嘛？ - 你…
- What? - You...

361
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,788
你都可以… 看别人…
You're allowed to look at everyone else...

362
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:52,131
…偷拍我的照片…却… 不让我们看你的照片…
...take our pictures, but, uh... we're not allowed to see you?

363
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,971
好吧 看够了啦…
OK. That's enough.

364
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:05,946
总觉得你要逃避什么…
Seems like you want to run away.

365
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:08,008
当我离开这里后 我会很开心
I'll just be happy when I can get out of here.

366
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:09,814
不知道耶… 我去过很多地方…
I don't know. I've been to a lot of places.

367
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:12,355
你不用跟我说没有地方比家更温暖的大道理…
You don't have to give me the "there's no place like home" speech.

368
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:13,981
听过了
I've heard it.

369
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:17,654
不 不 你可以去你想去的地方 做你想做的事
No, no. You can go wherever you want, see whatever you want to.

370
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:22,064
但一个好的地方 要有关心你的人 认识你的人的地方
But a place is only as good as the people you know in it.

371
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,732
我 嗯…
I, uh...

372
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:35,742
我觉得这里就很棒了
I think this is a pretty good place.

373
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,296
伯尼 你这个笨狗
Bernie, you dumb dog.

374
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:57,058
- 它是你的吗？ - 是的 我必须离开了
- Does he belong to you? - Yeah. I gotta go.

375
00:38:57,134 --> 00:39:00,763
嘿 等一下
Well, hey. Hold on a sec.

376
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:05,670
嗯…
Um...

377
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,781
换你了
Your turn.

378
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:17,384
谢谢
Thanks.

379
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,094
我没事
I'm fine.

380
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:36,605
听说你昨天在课堂上让人印象深刻
Heard you made quite an impression in class yesterday.

381
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:39,939
手电筒 这是一个愚蠢的恶作剧 但是班上…
Flashlight. It was a dumb prank. But that class...

382
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:43,036
- 无聊的要死？是的 - 是啊
- Boring as hell? Yeah. - Yeah.

383
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,162
听着 我知道这不关我的事
Look, I know it's none of my business, 

384
00:39:45,162 --> 00:39:47,244
但是你需要避开网络
but you need to stay off the grid.

385
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:49,081
- 你什么意思？ - 学校的人都在传
- What do you mean? - It's all over the school.

386
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,486
马克詹姆斯和他的人已经盯着你
Mark James and his man-tards have it out for you.

387
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,580
莎拉可能像我们一样…
Sarah may act like one of us...

388
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:54,783
…但她是跟他们一伙的
...she's one of them.

389
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:56,087
他喜欢莎拉？
He's into Sarah?

390
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:59,096
不仅这样 没人可以接近她
More than that. Nobody can go near her.

391
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,825
他们就像镇里的…
They were like the town...

392
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,230
哇！
Whoa!

393
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:04,632
废物！
Loser!

394
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:08,570
不… 好 来吧… 哦 天啊
No... OK, come on... Oh, God.

395
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,602
- 恶心 老兄！ - 真的
- Sucks to be you, bro! - Seriously.

396
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:15,236
要餐巾纸？清干净点！
Want a napkin? Get a cleanup crew!

397
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:20,047
到底是什么干的啊？
I wonder who did that?

398
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:23,316

他称自己是一个人类学家…

当你刚认识一个人的时候
When you first meet somebody, 

438
00:46:54,575 --> 00:46:56,708
你可能把所有的缺点都让对方知道吗？

439
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,010

你和你的朋友 撞了我的肩膀
So you have your friend throw me over his shoulder,

485

486
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:32,846
你只不过要像一个正常的人问我 就可以了
when all you had to do is ask me! Like a normal person!

487

499
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:44,021
你真应该去看看医生
You should really get that looked at.

500
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:46,860
我会的
I will.

是啊
Exactly.

508
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:16,149
谁会知道呢？
Who knows?

509
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:21,094
我想我是…
So, I guess I'll just...

510
00:53:21,164 --> 00:53:23,029
再见到你时“再见”吗？
...see you when I see you?

511
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:25,529
是的

512
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:29,503

约翰！在这
John! In here.

522
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:57,913
那么 你到底是什么？
So, what are you?

523
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:03,654
你把那些球员轻而易举的丢来丢去
You threw those football players around like it was nothing.

524
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:07,561
而且你手上的东西 那不是人类会做的
And the hand thing? That's not human.

525
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:10,929
所以我现在问你 你到底是什么？
So I'm asking you, what are you?

526
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:15,128
你要我威胁你吗？
Do I need to threaten you?

527
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:17,571
好吧 因为我用手机拍了下来
All right, 'cause I got some pictures on my phone,

528
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,039
之后大家就会开始一直问我这些问题了
and they're gonna start some major questions.

529
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:21,043
- 把它给我 - 不
- Give me that. - No.

530
00:56:21,077 --> 00:56:23,409
你知道我可以扁你的？
You know I can hurt you. Hm?

531
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:42,159
留着自己看吧
Knock yourself out.

532
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:52,365
我整个童年…
My entire childhood...

533
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:55,070
…就像X-档案里的故事
...has been an episode of X- Files.

534
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:00,572
你知道是什么滋味吗？
You know what it's like to feel something...

535
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:04,448
这么强烈…
...so strong...

536
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:06,421
…而且每天你都得告诉你自己
...that every day you have to keep telling yourself

537
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:09,584
而相信你爸会带你离开这鬼地方
your dad's gonna come back and take you away from this shithole.

538
00:57:09,626 --> 00:57:12,322
而我所相信的是事实
And that everything we believed in was true.

539
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:14,863
我并没有发疯
And that we were not crazy.

540
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,293
拜托
Please.

541
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:27,198
拜托
Please.

542
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:32,145
你爸是对的
Your dad was right.

543
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:35,145
什么？
What?

544
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,849
我说他是对的
He was right.

545
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:47,425
关于古代宇航员…
About ancient astronauts...

546
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:50,958
其他星球的生物…
...life on other planets...

547
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:54,566
所有的…
...all of it.

548
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:02,469
是的 我… 我知道… 我知道他不会离开我们的
Yes! I knew... I knew he wouldn't just leave us!

549
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:06,471
我是说 在墨西哥边境找到了他的车 但没见到人
I mean, they found his truck near the border of Mexico, and he was just gone.

550
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:08,347
- 也许他们带走了他 - 山姆…
- Maybe they took him. - Sam...

551
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:10,716
你知道的 如果他知道你在这里 他会回来的
If he knew you were here, he'd come home.

552
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:14,120
- 你不能告诉任何人 - 不会 我才不
- You can't tell anyone. - No, I-I-I wouldn't.

553
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,352
不 不 你必须答应我 不可以让任何人知道
No, no, no. You gotta promise me. Nobody knows this.

554
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:20,556
在从我来的星球有人在找我
There are others from where I'm from looking for me.

555
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:22,928
我在这很不安全…
I'm not safe.

556
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:27,936
山姆！我知道你在那里 马上给我滚进来… 现在！
Sam! I know you are in there. Get your ass in the house, now!

557
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:30,471
等我进去你在走…
Wait until I get inside and then go.

558
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,236
山姆？
Sam?

559
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:35,472
我答应你
I promise.

560
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:40,743
太好了！
Yes!

561
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:45,344
来吧
Come on.

562
00:58:59,836 --> 00:59:01,736
嘿 你这个疯子
Hey, you maniac.

563
00:59:01,804 --> 00:59:05,171
- 儿子？ - 到底怎么了…？
- Hello, son. - Hey, what's with the, uh...?

564
00:59:09,612 --> 00:59:10,601
你好 爸爸
Hello, Dad.

565
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,739
詹姆斯警长说有些男孩昨晚受伤了
Sheriff James says some boys got hurt last night.

566
00:59:12,815 --> 00:59:14,874
他们几个昨晚在医院住院
Couple of them spent the night in the hospital.

567
00:59:14,918 --> 00:59:16,408
- 你说是4个吗？ - 是 4个
- You said it was four? - Yeah, four.

568
00:59:16,486 --> 00:59:19,512
- 美式足队的      - 是的
- On the football team. - Yeah, that's right.

569
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:23,890
当然 他们什么也不说… 包括我儿子 马克
Of course, none of them are talking. That includes my own boy, Mark.

570
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:29,725
- 你儿子是马克？ - 是的 我儿子
- Your son is Mark? - Yeah, that's right.

571
00:59:29,766 --> 00:59:31,791
你知道他打球的那只手受伤了
You know, that was his throwing arm that got hurt.

572
00:59:31,868 --> 00:59:33,859
他说当时你在场
He said you were there.

573
00:59:36,105 --> 00:59:38,596
嗯 不 我当时是跟一个女生在那
Uh, no. I was actually with a girl.

574
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:42,737
所以我并没有很注意… 嗯…
So I wasn't paying any attention. Um...

575
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:43,803
莎拉霍尔特？
Sarah Hart?

576
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:52,079
没人想说到底真正发生了什么事…
Well, no one wants to be the first one to say what really happened.

577
00:59:52,121 --> 00:59:55,613
但 最后 会有人说的
But, eventually, someone will.

578
00:59:55,658 --> 00:59:58,354
我相信你是对的 谢谢你警长
I'm sure you're right. Thank you, Sheriff.

579
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,794
如果有任何消息 我们会先告诉你的
If we hear anything, we'll let you know.

580
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:23,679
- 他们有4人？ - 是的
- Four of them, huh? - Yeah.

581
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:27,051
很困难吧？
Was it difficult?

582
01:00:27,924 --> 01:00:29,983
很简单
Piece of cake.

583
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:32,654
很好 你开始掌握了
Good. Means you're getting it.

584
01:00:32,695 --> 01:00:34,720
上楼 收拾行李
Go upstairs, pack your stuff.

585
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,162
就因为昨晚的事嘛？
Because of last night?

586
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:38,826
因为我不喜欢有人一直来问问题
Because I don't like people showing up asking questions.

587
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:41,927
- 我认为这将提高你的能量 - “他们在我们当中”
- And I think this is gonna raise a few. - "They walk among us."

588
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,871
这是什么？ 更多怪异档案吗？
What is this? Some more "truth is out there" freaks?

589
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:46,841
实际上 这是你
Except that's actually you.

590
01:00:46,909 --> 01:00:49,070
一定有人拍到你
One of the kids must have caught you on video.

591
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:50,544
喔 该死
Oh, shit.

592
01:00:50,613 --> 01:00:52,672
他是个怪物
He's some kind of freak!

593
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:54,012
我无法攻破防火墙
I can't get through the firewall.

594
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:55,847
我们必须去那里 靠我们自己解决
We have to go there and take it down ourselves.

595
01:00:55,918 --> 01:00:58,045
他们(Mog)会看见这个 只是时间问题
Mogs see this, just a matter of time.

596
01:00:58,121 --> 01:01:00,419
打包行李 准备走了
Pack your stuff. We're leaving.

597
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:03,554
我不走
I'm not going.

598
01:01:04,927 --> 01:01:06,724
我有听错吗？ 你说什么？
I'm sorry, what did you say?

599
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,491
我说我不去
I'm not going.

600
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:12,763
好 如果你想选下一个地方 给你选…
OK. If you want to pick the next place, that's fine...

601
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:14,530
这从来不是我的战争！
It's not my fight and it never was!

602
01:01:14,604 --> 01:01:16,868
我也不记得有其他的星球
I can't even remember a world before this one.

603
01:01:16,939 --> 01:01:18,770
等等 等等…
Wait, wait...

604
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,173
…是不是因为那个女孩？
...is this because of a girl?

605
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:25,003
上楼 收拾你的行李
Go upstairs and get your stuff.

606
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:29,379
- 你不是我的父亲 - 不 不 不 他已经死了
- You're not my father. - No, no, no. He's dead.

607
01:01:29,419 --> 01:01:32,252
他因为你而死 事实上 你知道吗？
He died for you. In fact, you know what?

608
01:01:32,321 --> 01:01:36,223
你根本不知道有多少人为此牺牲了而你才能活到现在！
You have no idea how many others have made sacrifices so you could live!

609
01:01:36,292 --> 01:01:37,782
牺牲不是为了让你可以在这里
And it wasn't so you could come here

610
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:40,021
享受谈恋爱 跟正常男孩一样地生活！
and experience puppy love like a real live boy!

611
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:41,758
我不走
I'm not leaving.

612
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:47,434
约翰… 约翰！
John... John!

613
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:48,765
我不走！
I'm not leaving!

614
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:53,600
喔 是啊 我现在会这招了
Oh, yeah, I can do that now.

615
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:01,042
嘿 约翰！
Hey, John!

616
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:14,462
我要放开你了 好吗？
I'm letting go, OK?

617
01:02:15,598 --> 01:02:17,361
- 好吗？ - 好
- OK? - OK.

618
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:31,438
- 在我们星球上… - 告诉我他们为何要杀我
- On our planet... - Just tell me why they want to kill me.

619
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:35,975
Mogs他们不是殖民者 他们是屠杀者 他们继续前进
The Mogs, they don't colonize. They decimate. And then they move on.

620
01:02:36,052 --> 01:02:38,748
现在 他们来到了这里
And now, they've moved here.

621
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:43,725
很少人能阻止他们 但你和其他五个可以
There are few forces that can stop them. You and the other five can.

622
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,421
你的生存有重要的意义
You were saved for a bigger purpose.

623
01:02:45,461 --> 01:02:49,124
我不打算让你为了一个女孩儿而放弃
I'm not gonna let you throw that away for a girl.

624
01:02:49,165 --> 01:02:51,633
我不仅是为了女孩
She's not just a girl.

625
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:56,297
我想过要离开她…
I think about leaving her...

626
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:58,930
…但我办不到
...but I can't.

627
01:02:58,975 --> 01:03:01,409
我也不知道为什么
And I don't know why.

628
01:03:05,381 --> 01:03:09,283
我们不能爱上人类 更不能永远和我们在一起
We don't love like the humans. With us, it's forever.

629
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:15,220
你要记在心里
You never forget.

630
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:22,164
如果她是为了你 那就别让他们赢
If she is that for you, then don't let them win.

631
01:03:22,198 --> 01:03:24,564
切记自己的身份
Or you'll never forgive yourself.

632
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:28,694
我们必须走了
Now, we have to go.

633
01:03:30,006 --> 01:03:32,668
我今晚会注意网络的 你只有1天时间
I'll take care of the website tonight. Buy you a day.

634
01:03:32,742 --> 01:03:36,576
1天？ 告别吗？
A day? To say goodbye?

635
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:38,876
比起其他人算多的了
That's more than the rest of us had.

636
01:03:57,366 --> 01:03:59,266
他是个怪物啊！
He's some kind of freak!

637
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:12,575
亨利 我去找莎拉了
Henri, I'm going to Sarah's.

638
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:17,543
亨利？

639
01:04:38,841 --> 01:04:41,605
亨利？喂？亨利？

No, but come here and I'll tell you how to find him.

641
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:48,179

Who are you? Where's Henri?

642
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:51,118
华沙 印第安纳州威拉德417号

But the other guys, the ones that are chasing you...

649
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:21,009
他们会绑架吗？
...they do?

650
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:43,895
是…
That's it.

651
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:47,106
谢谢
Thanks.

652
01:05:54,884 --> 01:05:57,375
哇 你带了把枪？
Whoa! You brought a gun?

653
01:05:57,453 --> 01:06:00,445

I stole it from Ed. It might come in handy. Let's go.

654
01:06:00,523 --> 01:06:03,856
- 不 - 老兄 我来是帮你的

- What are you doing? - I'm not bailing.

658
01:06:32,254 --> 01:06:33,983
万一那些也是抓我爸爸的人呢？
What if these Mog people took my dad?

659
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:10,459
真神了！
Holy shit!

660
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:12,687
你是怎么办到的？
But you just dead-bolted it.

661
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:16,892
- 好了 得计划一下 - 是啊
- OK. New plan. - Yeah.

662

You follow that guy and you text me if he comes back, OK?

663
01:07:20,102 --> 01:07:21,933

665
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:13,444
- 你没事吧？ - 你不应该来这里
- Are you OK? - You're not supposed to be here.

666
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:15,643
- 怎么了？ - Mogs设了一个陷阱
- What happened? - The Mogs set this up.

667

We need to leave. They're coming.

668

你们都不要动 否者我会杀了这孩子
Everybody stays right where they are or I'll shoot this kid.

I'll do it! Get your hands up!

670

很高兴枪派上用场了
