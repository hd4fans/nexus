01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:05,303
Sorry I had to do it that way, boys.
抱歉，孩子们，我不得不采取这样的方法

799
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:07,639
It was the only way I could stop you in time.
这是唯一能及时阻止你们的办法

800
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:09,224
What happened, Colonel?
怎么回事，上校

801
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:11,101
Twelve terrorists got on board.
12个恐怖分子登上了飞机

802
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:14,146
They were in every corner of that plane with machine guns.
他们手持机关枪，遍布飞机上各个角落

803
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:15,856
It would've been a disaster.
我们冲进去就会闯祸的

804
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:18,567
He's an American. He was in the Navy.
他是美国人，美国海军潜水员

805
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:20,694
Where do we go from here?
下一步怎么办？

806
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:22,487
After them, I hope.
我想去追踪他们

807
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:35,208
They're going back to Beirut.
他们正飞回贝鲁特

808
01:02:35,376 --> 01:02:37,169
You mean it's all over for us?
你是说没有我们的事了

809
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:38,754
On the contrary, Colonel.
事情还没有完，上校

810
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:40,881
The president wants you to fly to Israel.
总统要你们飞往以色列

811
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:42,758
Israel?
去以色列？

812
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:45,761
[man] Israel is America's best friend in the Middle East,
以色列是美国在中东的盟友

813
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:47,345
and it's only 20 minutes from Beirut.
而且到贝鲁特只有20分钟的航程

814
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:50,807
You're gonna get anything and everything you want to do it right.
在那里你们可以得到一切援助

815
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:53,477
The president wants those people home.
总统决心要救出这些人质

816
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:56,396
So do we, General. So do we.
我们也是，将军，我们也决心要救出人质

817
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:21,713
We are Americans. Stay down.
我们是美军，快趴下！

818
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:28,887
- Clear.
行了，
- Clear!
行了

819
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:33,558
Not bad, McCoy. Not bad. Twenty seconds. Just like clockwork.
不错，麦考，只用了20秒钟，真不赖啊

820
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:35,852
- We can do it in ten.
应该只用十秒钟好，
- All right, one more time.
再来一次

821
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:42,473
以色列
空军基地7月20日星期六上午5:50

822
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:49,407
Hold it, McCoy. We got visitors.
等一下，麦考，我们有客人

823
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:53,578
- Colonel Alexander?
你是亚历山大上校吗？
- Yeah.
我是

824
01:03:53,746 --> 01:03:56,456
Good morning. I'm Colonel Amir from the Israeli Intelligence.
早上好，我是以色列情报局的阿米尔上校

Oh, yes. How are you? This is Major McCoy.

826
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:01,378
- Good morning, Major.
你好，少校
- Colonel.
你好，上校

827
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:04,214
- Can I talk to you?
上校，能和你谈谈吗？
- Well, certainly.
当然可以

828
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:06,591
Bobby, take over. I want it done in ten seconds.
波比，你来指挥，10秒钟内完成

829
01:04:06,759 --> 01:04:08,802
- You got it, sir.
明白了，
- We'll be right down.
我们这就下来

830
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:10,470
[Nick] So, what's happening?
出了什么事？

831
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:12,430
[Amir] They've taken the hostages off the plane.
他们把人质带离了飞机

832
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:14,182
- [Nick] Where to?
带哪儿去了？
- [Amir] I don't know.
这还不清楚

833
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:15,892
They could be spreading them all over Beirut by now.
他们现在大概被分散藏在贝鲁特各处

834
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:16,893
[Scott] That's bad.
糟糕

835
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:21,022
Colonel, I assume your Mossad still has people planted in Lebanon, right?
我想，你们摩萨德在黎巴嫩一定有许多特工吧

836
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,899
Your assumption is correct.
你猜得很对

837
01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:25,569
I need to get in contact with one of them.
我想和他们联系一下

838
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:29,656
You mean you want to get in and do some reckoning before the rescue?
你的意思是在行动之前去查看一下地形

839
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:30,991
It'd be a great help to us, Colonel.
这将是对我们莫大的帮助，上校

840
01:04:31,158 --> 01:04:32,701
If I may suggest...
我想起来…

841
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:36,288
They've announced an international press conference.
他们宣布说要举行一个新闻发布会

842
01:04:36,455 --> 01:04:38,790
Of course. Now that they got the world's attention,
当然，现在他们受到了全世界的关注

843
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:41,585
they wanna manipulate the press. Perfect.
他们想操纵新闻，这是最好的方法

844
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:48,159
贝鲁特
地中海海滨7月20日星期六上午8:00

845
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,955
让开，让他们进去，快点

846
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:39,354
快把床垫放进去

847
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,836
把他们喂拘

848
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:56,272
默罕默德，去加强守卫，快！

849
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,352
又是一场葬礼

850
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,272
又是一个基督教徒

851
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:50,338
I was in Beirut 20 years ago. You should have been here then.
20年之前我曾住在贝鲁特，现在你们也来这儿了

852
01:06:51,716 --> 01:06:52,757
It was something.
这儿有什么

853
01:06:52,925 --> 01:06:59,139
They had everything: nightclubs, dancing, concerts, laughter.
他们什么都有：夜总会，舞厅，演唱会，笑声

854
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:03,685
It was the Las Vegas of the Middle East.
曾被称为中东的拉斯维加斯

855
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:08,148
Beirut was beautiful then. Beautiful.
那时的贝鲁特是那么美

856
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:26,332
我不喜欢这个

857
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:28,432
你不喜欢什么？

858
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:30,674
这个基督教区

859
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:34,679
那个教堂？它早就在这里了

860
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,030
你要我们去摧毁它妈？

861
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,428
这个神父怎么样？

862
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:39,874
那个希腊人？

863
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:43,073
他从建这教堂起就在这儿了

864
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:46,518
他是个神父又是朋友，我们不能伤害他

865
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:49,239
我不信任这个基督徒

866
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:58,656
Hey, Marine heroes.
晦，陆战队英雄

867
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:02,327
Your friend.
你们的朋友

868
01:08:05,372 --> 01:08:07,207
He made the news.
他上了新闻

869
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:24,099
They killed him. They killed Tom.
他们杀了他，他们杀了汤姆

870
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:35,026
贝鲁特机场
7月22日星期一上午10:00

871
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:36,945
How have they been treating you, Captain?
他们有没有虐待你们，机长？

872
01:08:37,696 --> 01:08:40,031
- Sh!
厄
- Quite well.
还不错

873
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:42,659
They're feeding us. They're letting us use the rest rooms.
他们为我们提供了食物和日用品还让我们使用休息室

874
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:45,411
I suppose, under the circumstances, they're treating us quite well.
我想，在这样的状况下，他们待我们还算不错

875
01:08:45,579 --> 01:08:48,873
Where are the others? Where do they keep the Jews?
其他的人呢？他们还关着犹太人吗？

876
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:50,542
It's true about the selection?
关于有区别的对待是真的吗？

877
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:51,876
Go back!
往后退！

878
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:06,474
One more question!
还有一个问题！

879
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:12,522
If you try to be clever with me, Captain, I will kill you.
如果你想跟我玩花招，我会杀了你

880
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:15,150
That'd make you a real hero, wouldn't it?
那你就真成了英雄了是吗？

881
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:16,985
Yes, yes.
对，没错

882
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:21,406
Now, you go back to the press, but you watch what you say, huh?
现在继续回答记者的问题，但说话要小心

883
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:29,038
Now, ask your questions, please. One at a time.
现在请继续提问吧，每人一次

884
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:35,868
先生，请检查你的箱子…

885
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,673
相机也要检查

886
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:45,239
请出示护照

887
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:51,799
加拿大人，是的，加拿大CBC电视台的

888
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:55,078
今天似乎全世界的电视台都到这儿来了

889
01:09:57,359 --> 01:09:58,860
Belt.
皮带

890
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:01,993
抱歉

891
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:07,714
没事了

892
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:09,628
行了，没事了

893
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,552
祝你们在黎巴嫩过得愉快

894
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:12,948
谢谢

895
01:10:14,126 --> 01:10:15,835
Where'd you get the stupid belt?
你这烂皮带哪来的？

896
01:10:16,003 --> 01:10:17,754
You gave it to me for my birthday.

897
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:20,798
I did? I hope you like it.

898
01:10:44,114 --> 01:10:45,949
[priest] So you're Canadian.

899
01:10:46,116 --> 01:10:49,619
You're blessed with a beautiful and peaceful country.
你们很幸运，加拿大是一个美丽祥和的国家

900
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:51,621
I'd like to go there myself one day.
但愿哪天我也能去看看

901
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:54,499
Well, it's a beautiful country here. It's a shame.

902

Do you know where we need to go?

903
01:10:55,876 --> 01:10:58,211
Yes, my son. We're on our way.

You'll need these.

你朝右边看，可以看见一排主水管

906
01:11:27,866 --> 01:11:30,285
It will lead you directly to the backyard of the school.

907

That is where most of the hostages are.

Their headquarters. The Jews are there. Do you want to come with me?
他们的总部．犹太人就关在那里，你们要跟我去看看吗？

No, go and do what you have to do.
不了，你忙你的去吧

910
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:02,233
Under the seat you'll find something you might need... just in case.

Don't take too long.

头，你对他是否过于信任了

913
01:12:24,256 --> 01:12:27,842
The Israelis say he's the best man they have in Lebanon.
以色列方面说，他是他们在黎巴嫩最得力的人

914
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:30,803
And we need someone to get the message back to Nick.
而且我们必须通过他和尼克联系

915
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:13,346
神父

916
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:22,429
孩子，上帝将宽怒你

917
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:25,229
走

918
01:13:25,984 --> 01:13:27,610

Get the hell outta here.

You OK, Butch?

Yeah, I'm OK, boss.

930
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:55,693
Shit, that was a close one, huh?
妈的，真是太危险了

931
01:17:05,871 --> 01:17:07,204
[Nick] It's already 4:15.

We had him on the radio.
