1
00:02:06,184 --> 00:02:09,210
Oh, man! ls that what l think it is?

2
00:02:09,521 --> 00:02:13,184
All right, cheesedicks. Welcome to the Nam. Follow me.

3
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,525
l'll be dipped in shit. New meat!

4
00:02:23,902 --> 00:02:26,735
You dudes gonna love the Nam. For-fucking-ever.

5
00:02:27,806 --> 00:02:31,469
365 and a wake-up. Oh, lord.

6
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,433
Watch it below!

7
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:03,133
Morehouse, drop back to slack.

8
00:04:12,644 --> 00:04:14,168
Who's on tail-end Charlie?

9
00:04:25,957 --> 00:04:30,087
Eagle, Eagle, Ripper Six, Pos rep follows,'

10
00:04:30,428 --> 00:04:33,420
Lemur, Alpha, Whiskey, Alpha, Foxtrot...,

11
00:04:34,032 --> 00:04:37,092
Warren, you get out on flank.

12
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,235
-Hey, Hoffmeister! -Yo?

13
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:41,504
You got a smoke?

14
00:04:41,873 --> 00:04:44,740
-No, man, l don't. -Sin loi, man.

15
00:04:45,443 --> 00:04:48,037
Bravo 2-6. What's the delay on point?

16
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,745
Having compass trouble again?

17
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,471
Get a move on, boy.

18
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:53,336
Boy, what you waiting for?

19
00:05:53,678 --> 00:05:55,043
He ain't gonna bite you.

20
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,846
That's a good gook. Good and dead.

21
00:06:25,076 --> 00:06:27,408
-Cherry. -Yo, cherry!

22
00:06:28,747 --> 00:06:32,444
Move it out. Six says we're jamming them up back there. Over.

23
00:06:32,784 --> 00:06:35,378
Tell that dipshit to get fucked.

24
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:39,418
This is 2-5. Be advised. We're moving out shortly. Out.

25
00:06:39,758 --> 00:06:41,988
What's the matter with you, Taylor?

26
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,323
You are one simple son of a bitch.

27
00:06:44,663 --> 00:06:45,960
l'm sorry, sergeant.

28
00:06:46,298 --> 00:06:49,665
Get that other cherry up here. Gardner. And the doc.

29
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,866
Gardner, doc, up!

30
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,694
Gardner, doc, to the front!

31
00:06:58,243 --> 00:07:00,803
Gardner, get your ass up the hill, you fat fuck!

32
00:07:01,146 --> 00:07:03,171
Hurry up, bubble-butt!

33
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:22,724
-You all right? -Ants.

34
00:07:23,134 --> 00:07:25,125
l got ants all over my neck.

35
00:07:26,705 --> 00:07:29,071
You got some red ants.

36
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:33,066
Reds are killers. Black ants are the worse.

37
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,940
Hurry up, lard-ass!

38
00:07:38,817 --> 00:07:39,806
l'm so tired!

39
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,645
Just a little.

40
00:07:43,988 --> 00:07:47,116
Don't drink too much. l don't want you drinking any more.

41
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:48,619
l don't want you cramping up.

42
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,292
You're humping too much stuff.

43
00:07:51,663 --> 00:07:53,597
You don't need half this shit.

44
00:07:54,999 --> 00:07:56,796
l'll haul it for you.

45
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:01,003
But next time check with me first, all right?

46
00:08:02,173 --> 00:08:03,367
Thanks, sarge.

47
00:08:09,748 --> 00:08:12,216
-Are you okay? -Yeah.

48
00:08:20,825 --> 00:08:25,387
2-2, this is six, I understand you have a bird inbound at your pos,

49
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,566
Bravo Six, be advised.

50
00:08:31,903 --> 00:08:34,838
Resupply helo is inbound at this time, Over,

51
00:08:38,777 --> 00:08:41,746
Go, you people! Get that ammo off now!

52
00:09:23,655 --> 00:09:26,852
lt ain't D-E-R-E. lt's D-E-A-R.

53
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:30,958
And Sarah ain't got no two R's, King. Damn, you dumb!

54
00:09:31,996 --> 00:09:34,396
Don't matter. She know what l mean.

55
00:09:35,767 --> 00:09:37,860
She don't read too good nohow.

56
00:09:43,575 --> 00:09:45,702
Look at this shit! Pork again!

57
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:50,708
Trade me that turkey loaf for this pork shit, man. l can't eat this shit.

58
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,380
What you been smoking?

59
00:09:53,518 --> 00:09:58,285
l hope you don't get that laundry gig. Your ass need to hump, hump.

60
00:09:58,656 --> 00:10:01,022
Hey, white boy! What you waiting for?

61
00:10:01,826 --> 00:10:03,316
That hole won't dig itself.

62
00:10:03,661 --> 00:10:06,027
Come on. Get your dick skin on that thing!

63
00:10:06,364 --> 00:10:08,662
You ain't got all day! Dig, dig!

64
00:10:10,301 --> 00:10:14,237
Somebody once wrote, ''Hell is the impossibility of reason, ''

65
00:10:14,606 --> 00:10:17,370
That's what this place feels like,' hell,

66
00:10:17,842 --> 00:10:19,833
I hate it already, and it's only been a week,

67
00:10:20,178 --> 00:10:22,476
Some goddamn week, Grandma,

68
00:10:22,947 --> 00:10:27,247
The hardest thing I've ever done is go on point three times this week,

69
00:10:27,652 --> 00:10:29,176
I don't know what I'm doing,

70
00:10:29,521 --> 00:10:32,854
A gook could be right in front of me and I wouldn't know it,

71
00:10:33,224 --> 00:10:34,748
I'm so tired,

72
00:10:35,994 --> 00:10:37,291
We get up at 5,'00 a,m...

73
00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:42,362
...hump all day, camp around 4 or 5, dig a foxhole, eat...

74
00:10:42,734 --> 00:10:46,261
...then put out an all-night ambush or a listening post,

75
00:10:46,638 --> 00:10:49,198
Nobody tells me how to do anything because I'm new,

76
00:10:49,841 --> 00:10:53,777
Nobody cares about the new guys, They don't want to know your name,

77
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:58,674
A new guy's life isn't worth much because he hasn't put his time in yet,

78
00:10:59,017 --> 00:11:03,613
If you're gonna get killed in Nam, it's better to get it in the first weeks,

79
00:11:03,922 --> 00:11:06,686
The logic being, you don't suffer that much,

80
00:11:07,025 --> 00:11:09,050
If you're lucky, you stay in the perimeter...

81
00:11:09,394 --> 00:11:13,592
...then pull a guard shift, so you sleep three or four hours,

82
00:11:13,932 --> 00:11:15,194
But you don't really sleep,

83
00:11:22,874 --> 00:11:25,707
I don't think I can keep this up for a year,

84
00:11:26,077 --> 00:11:27,738
I've made a big mistake coming here,

85
00:11:31,616 --> 00:11:33,777
We got beaucoup movement.

86
00:11:37,355 --> 00:11:40,256
3rd Battalion got hit 1 5 klicks north of here.

87
00:11:40,592 --> 00:11:42,583
Charlie had claymores strung in the trees.

88
00:11:42,927 --> 00:11:46,954
Blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. Bad shit.

89
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,471
Got two lieutenants and a captain.

90
00:11:54,806 --> 00:11:55,966
Jesus.

91
00:11:57,809 --> 00:12:00,039
All right, who do you want on ambush?

92
00:12:01,112 --> 00:12:03,239
Elias, you take your squad out.

93
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:08,543
Warren, stay in, but l need Tex and Junior from your squad.

94
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:09,581
Roger.

95
00:12:09,921 --> 00:12:12,082
Move out in 2-0 mikes.

96
00:12:12,423 --> 00:12:15,358
l thought it was O'Neill's turn tonight.

97
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,160
Tubbs and Morehouse are short.

98
00:12:17,462 --> 00:12:21,728
Fu Sheng is going on R and R tomorrow. You want to send them out on ambush?

99
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,829
You got the fresh meat, buddy.

100
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:28,536
They don't know shit and we'll probably run into something. Think about it.

101
00:12:28,906 --> 00:12:30,771
Great. What do you want me to do?

102
00:12:31,142 --> 00:12:35,306
Get one of my guys zapped so a lame ass can get his beauty sleep?

103
00:12:36,247 --> 00:12:37,612
Hey, O'Neill...

104
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:39,314
...take a break.

105
00:12:39,651 --> 00:12:41,881
You needn't be a prick every day.

106
00:12:42,186 --> 00:12:43,813
Elias, get your men ready.

107
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,058
Guy's in 3 years, thinks he's Jesus Christ.

108
00:12:48,493 --> 00:12:51,485
O'Neill, your short-timers stay in, but you go out.

109
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:53,592
l need veterans out there.

110
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:56,527
Sergeant Barnes?

111
00:13:02,206 --> 00:13:05,903
l think in front of the men, l need to give the orders.

112
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,109
Yes, sir.

113
00:13:15,687 --> 00:13:17,450
Shit, looks like rain.

114
00:13:17,789 --> 00:13:20,189
lt's gonna piss on us all night.

115
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:25,657
lt'll put a serious case of crotch rot on that ugly face of yours.

116
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:30,532
Goddamn, man. You break your ass for the white man.

117
00:13:30,902 --> 00:13:32,233
No justice around here.

118
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:36,165
What's O'Neill got, a nose up the lieutenant's ass already?

119
00:13:36,507 --> 00:13:38,407
Why do we always get fucking ambush?

120
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,574
Because it's politics, man. Politics.

121
00:13:43,247 --> 00:13:46,683
-Did l show you a picture of Lucy Jean? -No, you didn't.

122
00:13:47,218 --> 00:13:49,914
She's the one for me all right, that Lucy Jean.

123
00:13:50,254 --> 00:13:51,846
She's waiting for me too.

124
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,681
She's real pretty. You're a lucky guy, Gardner.

125
00:13:55,026 --> 00:13:56,960
You got a picture of your girl?

126
00:13:57,762 --> 00:14:00,560
That leaves some unlucky girl back home, don't it?

127
00:14:02,433 --> 00:14:03,695
Tuck this in.

128
00:14:05,103 --> 00:14:06,400
Shit-can this.

129
00:14:07,905 --> 00:14:10,271
Don't need this. Turn around.

130
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:14,800
Come on.

131
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:19,446
Tex! You got Junior and Taylor here on your position.

132
00:14:19,784 --> 00:14:21,342
Elias, don't mess with my pig.

133
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:26,351
l ain't getting greased tonight. Keep this cheesedick off my ass.

134
00:14:26,691 --> 00:14:27,749
You got Taylor.

135
00:14:28,092 --> 00:14:29,992
Gardner, you're with me.

136
00:14:30,795 --> 00:14:34,458
ln case anything happens to you, you get lost or separated...

137
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:37,029
-...don't yell out, okay? -Okay.

138
00:14:37,401 --> 00:14:39,392
-Just sit tight and we'll get to you. -All right.

139
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,104
Saddle up! Lock and load!

140
00:15:37,161 --> 00:15:39,493
Mom and Dad didn't want me to come here,

141
00:15:39,831 --> 00:15:41,389
They want me to be just like them,'

142
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:45,759
Respectable, hard-working, a little house, a family,

143
00:15:46,137 --> 00:15:50,471
They drove me crazy with their goddamn world, Grandma, You know Mom,

144
00:15:53,311 --> 00:15:55,575
Having always been sheltered and special...

145
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,438
...I want to be anonymous like everyone else,

146
00:15:58,783 --> 00:16:00,307
Do my share for my country,

147
00:16:00,651 --> 00:16:03,984
Live up to what Grandpa did in the first war, Dad in the second,

148
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:07,383
Well, here I am, Anonymous, all right,

149
00:16:07,725 --> 00:16:10,193
With guys nobody really cares about,

150
00:16:10,628 --> 00:16:12,721
They come from the end of the line,

151
00:16:13,064 --> 00:16:14,793
Small towns you never heard of,

152
00:16:15,132 --> 00:16:18,158
Polaski, Tennessee, Brandon, Mississippi,

153
00:16:18,536 --> 00:16:21,403
Pork Bend, Utah, Wampum, Pennsylvania,

154
00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:24,003
Two years high school's about it,

155
00:16:24,342 --> 00:16:26,970
If they're lucky, a job waiting for them in a factory,

156
00:16:27,311 --> 00:16:28,869
Most of them got nothing,

157
00:16:29,213 --> 00:16:30,976
They're poor and unwanted...

158
00:16:31,315 --> 00:16:33,875
...yet they're fighting for our society and freedom,

159
00:16:34,986 --> 00:16:38,387
It's weird, They're the bottom of the barrel, and they know it,

160
00:16:39,323 --> 00:16:41,188
Maybe that's why they call themselves grunts,

161
00:16:41,525 --> 00:16:44,722
Because a grunt can take it, can take anything,

162
00:16:45,062 --> 00:16:48,520
They're the best I've ever seen, Grandma, The heart and soul,

163
00:16:52,236 --> 00:16:53,362
Hey, Taylor?

164
00:16:54,071 --> 00:16:56,198
Hey, cheesedick, you're up.

165
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,303
-What? -You're up.

166
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,947
-Sure you can work the claymores? -l'm sure.

167
00:17:04,515 --> 00:17:07,450
Flick the safety off and bang on it three times.

168
00:17:07,752 --> 00:17:09,310
Three times. l got it.

169
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:17,484
Don't catch any Z's on me, or l'll sling your sorry ass! Hear me?

170
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,090
Okay.

171
00:17:30,207 --> 00:17:33,699
Maybe I finally found it way down here in the mud,

172
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,146
Maybe from down here I can start up again,

173
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,577
Be something I can be proud of without faking it, Be a fake human being,

174
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:46,456
Maybe I can see something I don't yet see, learn something I don't yet know,

175
00:17:47,558 --> 00:17:50,527
I miss you, I miss you very much,

176
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,261
Tell Mom I miss her too, Chris,

177
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:12,573
Junior.

178
00:18:19,757 --> 00:18:22,692
-All right, motherfucker. -lt's your shift, man.

179
00:18:26,998 --> 00:18:28,522
Here, take this.

180
00:21:10,928 --> 00:21:12,919
Blow the fucking claymore!

181
00:21:13,264 --> 00:21:13,662
Take the safety off! Damn it!

182
00:21:15,533 --> 00:21:16,192
Take the safety off! Damn it!

183
00:21:20,604 --> 00:21:22,071
Get the safety off!

184
00:21:31,715 --> 00:21:34,206
Feed me, Junior! Get over here and feed me!

185
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,732
-Jesus-fucking-Christ! -Easy, boy.

186
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,545
-Doc, Gardner's hit! -Right there!

187
00:22:07,384 --> 00:22:09,944
Oh, shit. l'm hit!

188
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,847
Doc, Taylor's hit! Taylor's hit!

189
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,487
-Oh, shit. -Doc, doc!

190
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:16,819
How bad is it?

191
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:18,753
He didn't blow his claymore!

192
00:22:19,096 --> 00:22:22,327
Relax, man. lt's a scratch. Hold this on here.

193
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,190
Don't lie. How bad is it?

194
00:22:24,568 --> 00:22:27,401
He let them walk right up on us! He was asleep on his shift!

195
00:22:28,105 --> 00:22:29,367
No, l did not.

196
00:22:29,707 --> 00:22:31,504
Big Harold, keep an eye on him.

197
00:22:31,842 --> 00:22:33,469
Don't let him go into shock.

198
00:22:33,844 --> 00:22:34,708
Shut up!

199
00:22:35,045 --> 00:22:38,446
Shut up and take the pain. Take the pain!

200
00:22:47,024 --> 00:22:51,654
Red rag, red rag, bravo six, I have NDPs at this time, Over,

201
00:23:04,808 --> 00:23:07,436
Hey, little guy, you're gonna be okay.

202
00:23:08,812 --> 00:23:09,938
Don't worry.

203
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:16,983
Do you know if you're gonna die?

204
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,749
Do you feel it'll all be fine?

205
00:23:22,092 --> 00:23:24,890
No morbid bullshit. You're about to get out of here.

206
00:23:26,163 --> 00:23:31,100
They're gonna give you three hot meals a day. White sheets.

207
00:23:31,468 --> 00:23:34,869
Pretty white nurses will give you blow jobs if you pay them.

208
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:38,265
-l heard about them white bitches. -Don't baby talk him.

209
00:23:38,609 --> 00:23:42,170
The cocksucker fell asleep. He let them walk right up on us!

210
00:23:42,513 --> 00:23:44,208
Just shut up, Junior.

211
00:23:45,683 --> 00:23:47,150
You relax. Okay, man?

212
00:23:50,521 --> 00:23:52,512
lt's not so bad...

213
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,852
...dying.

214
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,951
How long?

215
00:23:59,363 --> 00:24:01,194
How long?

216
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,832
Bird's on the way. Hang in there. You'll make it.

217
00:24:16,647 --> 00:24:19,810
Come on, Gardner, hang in there. You're gonna make it!

218
00:24:20,284 --> 00:24:22,548
Come on. Don't quit.

219
00:24:24,188 --> 00:24:26,816
Come on, Gardner, help me. Don't give up!

220
00:24:59,523 --> 00:25:02,788
You all take a good look at this lump of shit.

221
00:25:04,895 --> 00:25:06,863
Remember what it looks like.

222
00:25:08,198 --> 00:25:13,295
You fuck up in a firefight and l guarantee you a trip out of the bush...

223
00:25:13,871 --> 00:25:15,338
...in a body bag.

224
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:19,907
Out here, assholes, you keep your shit wired tight at all times.

225
00:25:23,247 --> 00:25:25,112
That goes for you, shit-for-brains.

226
00:25:26,884 --> 00:25:29,876
You don't sleep on no fucking ambush.

227
00:25:32,523 --> 00:25:35,754
The next son of a bitch l catch copping Z's in the bush...

228
00:25:36,093 --> 00:25:39,187
...l'm personally gonna make him suffer.

229
00:25:41,131 --> 00:25:42,792
l shit you not.

230
00:25:45,569 --> 00:25:47,093
Tag him and bag him.

231
00:25:48,939 --> 00:25:50,930
l didn't fall asleep, sergeant.

232
00:25:51,742 --> 00:25:53,676
-lt was Junior. -Shut up, chickenshit.

233
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:55,706
You're in big trouble, boy.

234
00:25:56,046 --> 00:25:58,913
Excuses are like assholes. Everybody's got one.

235
00:25:59,249 --> 00:26:00,716
Knock it off!

236
00:26:03,053 --> 00:26:05,715
We got two men need attention here.

237
00:26:07,157 --> 00:26:09,625
Police up your extra ammo and frags.

238
00:26:09,927 --> 00:26:12,327
Don't leave nothing for the dinks.

239
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:18,065
Carry Gardner.

240
00:26:21,138 --> 00:26:24,699
Man would be alive if he had a few more days to learn something.

241
00:26:52,002 --> 00:26:52,900
Hey, Taylor.

242
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,135
What's in the breeze?

243
00:26:55,472 --> 00:26:57,030
Got light duty. Three days' worth.

244
00:26:57,374 --> 00:27:00,707
No shit. Too bad we're in base camp anyway.

245
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:02,170
What you got? Beers?

246
00:27:02,513 --> 00:27:06,108
Stole some from the Top's supply. Shit, he's been stealing it from us.

247
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:09,984
What are you, back?

248
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,550
Yeah, it looks like it.

249
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,585
Where'd you get the beers, boy?

250
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:15,789
l found it.

251
00:27:16,126 --> 00:27:18,651
Found it? You're going on report, son, now.

252
00:27:18,996 --> 00:27:22,295
Both of you, come with me. l got a job for you.

253
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:30,604
Motherfucker!

254
00:27:36,847 --> 00:27:38,974
l'm too short for this shit, man.

255
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:41,948
They're always fucking with us.

256
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:43,583
No letup.

257
00:27:44,221 --> 00:27:45,916
Politics, man.

258
00:27:46,256 --> 00:27:47,723
Fucking politics.

259
00:27:48,058 --> 00:27:53,155
That O'Neill's got his nose so far up Top's ass, he's gotta be Pinocchio.

260
00:27:54,064 --> 00:27:55,395
Thirty-nine and a wake-up.

261
00:27:55,732 --> 00:27:58,496
A pause for the cause and l'm a gone motherfucker.

262
00:27:59,937 --> 00:28:01,632
-Back to the world. -l hear you.

263
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:03,906
l broke a hundred the other day.

264
00:28:04,274 --> 00:28:08,108
Ninety-two left to go. April 1 7th.

265
00:28:08,445 --> 00:28:10,276
Home to California.

266
00:28:10,614 --> 00:28:14,209
l'll be sitting outside checking out the babes on the beach.

267
00:28:14,518 --> 00:28:16,816
The surfing's gonna be good.

268
00:28:18,088 --> 00:28:20,318
March, man, in Tennessee.

269
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:25,026
Sniff the pines. Sniff that pussy down by the river.

270
00:28:25,362 --> 00:28:26,954
Hot damn!

271
00:28:27,464 --> 00:28:30,456
Hey, Taylor, how long you got left?

272
00:28:31,034 --> 00:28:33,400
-Three hundred and what? -Thirty-two.

273
00:28:35,405 --> 00:28:37,134
Three hundred and thirty-two days.

274
00:28:37,474 --> 00:28:39,305
Sin loi, my boy.

275
00:28:39,743 --> 00:28:43,304
l can't even remember when l was 332, man.

276
00:28:43,647 --> 00:28:47,947
You gotta count backwards or something, like you got 40 days in.

277
00:28:48,251 --> 00:28:50,242
Think positive, dude.

278
00:28:51,922 --> 00:28:55,483
How in the fuck did you get here anyway? You look educated.

279
00:28:55,826 --> 00:28:58,090
-l volunteered for it. -You did what?

280
00:28:58,428 --> 00:28:59,395
l volunteered.

281
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:04,292
l dropped out of college and told them l wanted infantry, combat, Vietnam.

282
00:29:04,668 --> 00:29:07,330
You volunteered for this shit, man?

283
00:29:08,071 --> 00:29:09,265
Can you believe that?

284
00:29:09,973 --> 00:29:12,498
You is a crazy fucker, giving up college.

285
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,440
lt didn't make much sense. l wasn't learning anything.

286
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:21,183
Why should the poor kids go to war and the rich kids get away with it?

287
00:29:21,818 --> 00:29:23,513
What we got here is a crusader.

288
00:29:24,988 --> 00:29:27,286
-Sounds like it. -Shit.

289
00:29:28,358 --> 00:29:31,293
You gotta be rich in the first place to think like that.

290
00:29:32,763 --> 00:29:34,162
Everybody knows...

291
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,561
...the poor's always fucked over by the rich.

292
00:29:38,935 --> 00:29:41,529
Always have, always will.

293
00:29:45,842 --> 00:29:49,209
lf you be cool, l'll introduce you to some of the heads.

294
00:29:49,546 --> 00:29:51,013
What are the heads?

295
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,113
Later, man.

296
00:30:00,624 --> 00:30:01,488
What's up, brother?

297
00:30:06,797 --> 00:30:09,288
Your Highness has arrived. What's happening?

298
00:30:09,666 --> 00:30:13,966
l thought you was hanging ten in Cambodia.

299
00:30:23,313 --> 00:30:24,610
Why are you in the underworld?

300
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:29,612
This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot. This is Chris. He been resurrected.

301
00:30:38,762 --> 00:30:40,855
You lame, Taylor?

302
00:30:41,198 --> 00:30:42,995
Are you lame or something?

303
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:46,796
Go ahead, old man. Smoke it.

304
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,884
Your shit's in the wind, troop.

305
00:31:05,188 --> 00:31:06,712
Hey, man. What's happening?

306
00:31:07,057 --> 00:31:09,287
lf you do that ''baa,'' you do it right.

307
00:31:13,263 --> 00:31:14,730
You're weird, man.

308
00:31:15,465 --> 00:31:18,229
You're a child. l don't waste time on you.

309
00:31:29,212 --> 00:31:31,407
-First time? -Yeah.

310
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:36,918
Then the worm has definitely turned for you, man.

311
00:31:38,822 --> 00:31:40,153
Feel good?

312
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:44,255
Yeah, it feels good. l got no pain in my neck now.

313
00:31:45,295 --> 00:31:47,695
Feeling good's good enough.

314
00:31:58,408 --> 00:32:00,535
Put your mouth on this.

315
00:32:21,765 --> 00:32:24,029
Where the hell is everybody, man?

316
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:29,134
They're getting high. Bunch of hopheads. They think they're special.

317
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,600
Listen to that. That's a bad jam.

318
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:36,337
Redneck noise, dude. That's all it is.

319
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,910
Make about as much sense as you do.

320
00:32:39,349 --> 00:32:42,375
All them chucks be rapping about how they losing their ho...

321
00:32:42,686 --> 00:32:45,450
...saying how they ain't got no bread for beer.

322
00:32:46,723 --> 00:32:50,682
Fuck that honky shit! Gotta get me some Motown jams, dig it?

323
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:54,655
What are you talking that shit for?

324
00:32:54,998 --> 00:32:56,829
Junior, you ever smoke any shit?

325
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,064
That's right.

326
00:32:58,401 --> 00:33:01,962
You trying to keep the black man down and string him out on that shit.

327
00:33:02,339 --> 00:33:05,831
But the time's coming when the black man will throw that yoke off.

328
00:33:06,176 --> 00:33:08,940
Simple. Free your mind, your ass will follow.

329
00:33:09,412 --> 00:33:14,281
Yeah, l can dig it, man. You smoke that shit and everything gets weird.

330
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,579
You hear about gooks putting chemicals in the grass...

331
00:33:17,921 --> 00:33:20,321
...so we don't fight, so we become pacifists.

332
00:33:20,657 --> 00:33:23,592
But don't you worry, Bunny, you's a killer anyway.

333
00:33:23,927 --> 00:33:26,487
But l still like a piece of pussy once in a while.

334
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:29,890
Nothing like a piece of pussy, except maybe the lndy 500.

335
00:33:30,267 --> 00:33:33,828
Only way you get pussy is if the bitch dies and wills it to you...

336
00:33:34,204 --> 00:33:35,296
...and then maybe.

337
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,372
How's it going, Bunny?

338
00:33:42,178 --> 00:33:43,167
L.T.

339
00:33:43,713 --> 00:33:44,771
Check it out.

340
00:33:47,384 --> 00:33:48,442
You like that?

341
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:50,245
Terrific.

342
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,982
l'll send it home.

343
00:33:53,356 --> 00:33:54,220
Hey, Junior.

344
00:33:55,358 --> 00:33:57,326
-Lieutenant. -Hello, sir.

345
00:34:06,436 --> 00:34:08,802
Rodriguez, that's quite a shrine you have.

346
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,434
Thank you, sir.

347
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:14,306
-You need anything? -No, sir.

348
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:16,243
Now, wait. This guy's three or four times my size.

349
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:18,610
Now, wait. This guy's three or four times my size.

350
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:20,644
He's in the O'Neill death grip.

351
00:34:20,951 --> 00:34:23,579
He doesn't know whether to shit or go blind.

352
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,184
-What do you say, L.T.? -How you doing, Red?

353
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:29,458
Not good. This cocksucker has every card in the deck.

354
00:34:29,793 --> 00:34:30,953
Full house.

355
00:34:31,494 --> 00:34:32,859
You're doing all right.

356
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,664
Yeah, and l ain't even cheating yet.

357
00:34:35,999 --> 00:34:40,732
-Lieutenant, some Kentucky windage? -Oh, thanks, Andy.

358
00:34:42,339 --> 00:34:43,328
Play, lieutenant?

359
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:47,473
No. Wouldn't want to get raped by you guys.

360
00:34:47,811 --> 00:34:50,644
Why's that, lieutenant? What are you saving up to be?

361
00:34:50,981 --> 00:34:51,879
Jewish?

362
00:34:57,854 --> 00:34:59,014
l gotta run.

363
00:34:59,589 --> 00:35:02,581
l'll catch you men later. Enjoy yourselves tonight.

364
00:35:09,432 --> 00:35:12,401
That is one sorry-ass motherfucker.

365
00:35:14,671 --> 00:35:18,198
What do you say there, Bob? A guy like that make it? Yes or no?

366
00:35:20,276 --> 00:35:22,437
l have to say that's precisely what l saw.

367
00:35:22,779 --> 00:35:27,113
Sometimes l just look at a guy, and l know he's not going to make it.

368
00:35:27,684 --> 00:35:29,208
Just no fucking way.

369
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,617
New Year's Day, 1 968,

370
00:36:37,187 --> 00:36:40,179
Just another day, Staying alive,

371
00:36:40,523 --> 00:36:45,051
Lots of movement near the Cambodian border, NVA regiments moving across,

372
00:36:45,395 --> 00:36:47,693
A lot of little firefights, ambushes,

373
00:36:48,031 --> 00:36:52,525
We drop bombs, then we walk through the jungle like ghosts in a landscape,

374
00:37:13,289 --> 00:37:14,313
Bunker.

375
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:16,549
Where?

376
00:37:37,614 --> 00:37:41,243
Bravo 2, Bravo 2-5, I've got beaucoup bunkers up here, Over,

377
00:37:42,819 --> 00:37:47,654
2-5, 2, Roger, Bunkers at point, Two actuals on the way, Over,

378
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:33,429
Bravo 6, Bravo 2, Be advised there is a bunker complex up front,

379
00:38:33,803 --> 00:38:36,135
We're on our way down, Over,

380
00:38:38,841 --> 00:38:40,206
See you next week.

381
00:39:00,697 --> 00:39:04,155
Taylor, get your ass up on that flank, about 50 meters.

382
00:39:04,534 --> 00:39:06,900
Washington, you cover this side.

383
00:39:07,503 --> 00:39:09,232
-Yes, sir. -Get off your ass, Harold.

384
00:39:09,572 --> 00:39:10,436
Shit.

385
00:39:11,407 --> 00:39:12,203
Bummer!

386
00:40:04,661 --> 00:40:09,291
Christ, look at that. The teapot's still boiling. They were just here!

387
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:14,734
Man, this is spooky, Sander. Let's get out of here.

388
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,415
Watch it, watch it!

389
00:41:42,754 --> 00:41:44,312
Look what we got, Sal.

390
00:41:44,822 --> 00:41:46,483
We got maps.

391
00:41:48,426 --> 00:41:49,654
We got...

392
00:41:50,261 --> 00:41:53,162
-...S-2 stuff. -That's the gooks' stuff. Let's go!

393
00:41:53,531 --> 00:41:56,125
No, Sal, this is important. This is important.

394
00:42:01,172 --> 00:42:03,072
Come on. Let's go.

395
00:42:05,443 --> 00:42:06,637
Booby trap! Get down!

396
00:42:12,917 --> 00:42:13,975
Medic!

397
00:42:17,388 --> 00:42:18,787
Holy gee!

398
00:42:33,604 --> 00:42:35,367
Goddamn it.

399
00:42:40,578 --> 00:42:43,308
We got two men down, sir. There was an explosion.

400
00:42:43,614 --> 00:42:45,809
This-- We need help, sir. ASAP.

401
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:49,449
Move your ass out of here! One round to get you all!

402
00:42:49,787 --> 00:42:51,778
Rodriguez, move it! Junior, let's go!

403
00:42:52,123 --> 00:42:53,090
Lieutenant.

404
00:42:53,991 --> 00:42:56,789
Tell 6 we need engineers. This pos is full of traps.

405
00:42:57,161 --> 00:42:58,059
They're coming.

406
00:42:58,429 --> 00:43:01,262
NVA were seen at a village half a klick down the river.

407
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,294
Now, 6 says to get there ASAP.

408
00:43:03,634 --> 00:43:06,797
Also, leave four of your men here and a medic.

409
00:43:07,138 --> 00:43:08,264
-All right. -Move it out.

410
00:43:32,063 --> 00:43:34,725
Pull the flanks in! Let's move!

411
00:43:37,134 --> 00:43:38,328
Hey, where's Manny?

412
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:49,876
Manny, where you at?

413
00:44:16,274 --> 00:44:18,174
We had to reach the village before dark,

414
00:44:18,509 --> 00:44:18,770
We left Elias and some men to keep looking and to wait for the engineers,

415
00:44:20,745 --> 00:44:22,212
We left Elias and some men to keep looking and to wait for the engineers,

416
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,004
But it was King who found him...

417
00:44:24,348 --> 00:44:27,784
...about 1 000 yards downriver, not far from the village,

418
00:44:32,657 --> 00:44:34,386
It was the end of the mystery,

419
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:08,315
The motherfuckers.

420
00:45:16,334 --> 00:45:21,169
The village, which was maybe 1 000 years old, didn't know we were coming,

421
00:45:21,539 --> 00:45:23,370
If they had, they would have run,

422
00:45:24,008 --> 00:45:28,877
Barnes was at the eye of our rage and through him, our Captain Ahab...

423
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:30,909
...who would set things right again,

424
00:45:31,248 --> 00:45:33,409
That day, we loved him,

425
00:45:38,856 --> 00:45:40,346
There he goes, sarge.

426
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:49,693
-Pick him up. -Yeah, you got it, sarge.

427
00:45:50,835 --> 00:45:51,893
Let's go.

428
00:45:54,972 --> 00:45:56,940
Get that stupid look off your face!

429
00:45:58,776 --> 00:46:00,767
O'Neill, clear out these hooches.

430
00:46:01,078 --> 00:46:03,444
Hey, piggy-piggy. Hey, pig.

431
00:46:08,786 --> 00:46:11,084
Bunny, you've got to bring the hooches down.

432
00:46:11,422 --> 00:46:15,586
Spread out on the right. Watch your back. Let's go!

433
00:46:17,194 --> 00:46:18,718
What do you got here, huh?

434
00:46:22,133 --> 00:46:23,464
Get over there! Move it!

435
00:46:23,801 --> 00:46:25,268
Come on, let's go!

436
00:46:26,404 --> 00:46:28,463
Let's go, Junior, bring them in.

437
00:46:35,112 --> 00:46:37,603
Get out of there, you fuckheads! Move!

438
00:46:53,397 --> 00:46:54,455
Come on!

439
00:46:57,468 --> 00:46:59,834
-Put them in the pigpen! -Get over here.

440
00:47:01,472 --> 00:47:03,406
Get back! Shut up!

441
00:47:03,741 --> 00:47:05,436
Give me your willie pete.

442
00:47:09,313 --> 00:47:10,507
Get back!

443
00:47:10,981 --> 00:47:12,846
Fire in the hole!

444
00:47:23,894 --> 00:47:25,020
Shut up!

445
00:47:27,732 --> 00:47:29,199
Get them out of here!

446
00:47:29,767 --> 00:47:31,632
Oh, fuck! We got one.

447
00:47:35,973 --> 00:47:37,497
Get the fuck out of the hole!

448
00:47:37,842 --> 00:47:40,242
Get out of there. Come on, motherfucker!

449
00:47:40,544 --> 00:47:42,705
Be cool! Be cool! They're scared, man!

450
00:47:43,047 --> 00:47:45,675
Oh, they're scared, huh? What about me, man?

451
00:47:46,016 --> 00:47:49,645
l'm sick of this fucking shit! Come on, motherfucker, move!

452
00:47:50,354 --> 00:47:51,719
Watch this fucker!

453
00:47:52,056 --> 00:47:54,616
Who the fuck do they think we're fighting for?

454
00:47:54,959 --> 00:47:57,223
-You got one more! -Hey, hey!

455
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,097
Well, what have we here?

456
00:48:07,538 --> 00:48:12,601
They have one, two, three, four Mag 58 Czechoslovakian machine guns.

457
00:48:12,943 --> 00:48:14,706
They got two, four....

458
00:48:16,013 --> 00:48:20,382
Barnes, they got enough rice here to feed a whole fucking regiment.

459
00:48:22,853 --> 00:48:26,016
Sergeant Warren, you bring the honcho over here.

460
00:48:26,357 --> 00:48:29,292
Tubbs, get out of there! Junior, burn it!

461
00:48:30,027 --> 00:48:32,757
What the fuck's the matter? l wasn't gonna hurt you!

462
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:34,688
Look like l was gonna hurt you?

463
00:48:35,065 --> 00:48:38,523
Why didn't you listen to me?! Why didn't you fucking listen to me?!

464
00:48:39,203 --> 00:48:41,899
Fucking stupid?! You stupid asshole!

465
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:45,037
Get the fuck up here! Come here, motherfucker!

466
00:48:45,376 --> 00:48:49,073
What are you smiling at?! Why the fuck didn't you listen to me?!

467
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:50,369
Do them, man!

468
00:48:50,981 --> 00:48:54,382
What are you smiling at?! You want something to smile at, huh?!

469
00:48:54,718 --> 00:48:57,186
-You want something to smile at?! -That's right!

470
00:48:57,521 --> 00:48:59,011
-Dance, motherfucker! -Yeah!

471
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,388
Dance, one-legger!

472
00:49:04,762 --> 00:49:06,923
Dance! Dance!

473
00:49:08,799 --> 00:49:11,427
Dance! One-legged motherfucker!

474
00:49:18,976 --> 00:49:20,944
Come on. Come on, let's go, man.

475
00:49:25,916 --> 00:49:29,374
Fucking pussy, man! He's laughing at you!

476
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:32,181
That's the way the gook laughs.

477
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:34,055
Yeah, sure you are!

478
00:49:34,391 --> 00:49:36,359
You're real sorry, ain't you?

479
00:49:36,694 --> 00:49:40,721
You're just crying your little hearts out about Sandy and Sal and Manny.

480
00:49:41,098 --> 00:49:43,794
Forget about it, Bunny, huh? Let's go.

481
00:49:44,668 --> 00:49:45,692
What do you say?

482
00:50:06,657 --> 00:50:10,252
Holy shit! You see that fucking head come apart, man?

483
00:50:11,495 --> 00:50:14,089
l never seen brains like that before, man.

484
00:50:17,635 --> 00:50:20,604
l bet you the old bitch runs the whole fucking show.

485
00:50:20,938 --> 00:50:25,136
She probably cut Manny's throat. Probably cut my balls off if she could.

486
00:50:25,476 --> 00:50:27,603
Bunny, we leave now, nobody saw a thing!

487
00:50:27,912 --> 00:50:29,436
You understand, Taylor?

488
00:50:30,281 --> 00:50:31,976
Come on, let's fucking do her! Let's do the whole fucking village!

489
00:50:35,419 --> 00:50:38,286
There's scars on this gook honcho, sarge.

490
00:50:40,257 --> 00:50:41,781
Get out of here, Tubbs.

491
00:50:51,669 --> 00:50:53,227
Where did he get these wounds?

492
00:50:58,075 --> 00:51:01,340
-Says he was hit in a bombing raid. -He's a dink for sure.

493
00:51:03,948 --> 00:51:06,109
Ask him why these weapons are here.

494
00:51:09,987 --> 00:51:13,354
They had no choice. The NVA killed the old honcho when he said no.

495
00:51:13,691 --> 00:51:17,252
-He says all the rice is theirs. -Oh, bullshit, Lerner.

496
00:51:17,594 --> 00:51:20,586
Who the hell was the gook we nailed on the riverbank?

497
00:51:27,705 --> 00:51:31,106
He doesn't know. The NVA ain't been here in a couple of months.

498
00:51:31,442 --> 00:51:34,343
-Maybe he was a scout. -Yeah, sure. A scout.

499
00:51:34,645 --> 00:51:37,773
What about the rice and the weapons?! Who they for?!

500
00:51:38,749 --> 00:51:40,239
An NVC!

501
00:51:40,584 --> 00:51:43,212
That cocksucker knows what l'm saying. Don't you?

502
00:51:43,554 --> 00:51:45,681
Goddamn right he does.

503
00:51:46,023 --> 00:51:46,921
He's lying!

504
00:51:47,257 --> 00:51:49,953
Waste the fucker! Then see who talks.

505
00:51:50,361 --> 00:51:52,522
Look, he says he doesn't know anything.

506
00:51:58,202 --> 00:52:01,467
He hates the NVA, but they come when they want and take over.

507
00:52:01,805 --> 00:52:03,067
What's the bitch saying?

508
00:52:03,941 --> 00:52:06,409
She's going on about why we killed the pigs...

509
00:52:06,744 --> 00:52:09,406
...they're farmers, they have to make a living....

510
00:52:18,522 --> 00:52:19,614
Shut up!

511
00:52:20,591 --> 00:52:21,956
Shut her the fuck up!

512
00:52:47,217 --> 00:52:50,812
You tell him to start talking or l'll waste more of them.

513
00:52:51,622 --> 00:52:52,953
Tell him, Lerner!

514
00:52:59,363 --> 00:53:01,422
Let us in on this, all right?

515
00:53:07,004 --> 00:53:09,734
Let's go for it! Let's do the whole fucking village!

516
00:53:10,407 --> 00:53:13,069
Come on, sarge. What the fuck are we waiting for?

517
00:53:16,613 --> 00:53:18,604
-Let's do them! -Out of my way!

518
00:53:21,885 --> 00:53:24,251
This is his daughter, right? Right?

519
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:36,457
You lie! No, you lie! You VC!

520
00:53:45,309 --> 00:53:46,333
Barnes!

521
00:53:54,918 --> 00:53:57,045
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

522
00:54:01,258 --> 00:54:03,351
Stay out of this. lt ain't your show.

523
00:54:04,595 --> 00:54:07,723
You ain't a firing squad, you piece of shit!

524
00:54:08,165 --> 00:54:10,793
-Get him! -Come on, Barnes!

525
00:54:11,635 --> 00:54:15,298
Get him! Get him! Tear his fucking head off!

526
00:54:22,146 --> 00:54:24,774
Come on, Elias. Send him to hell!

527
00:54:26,517 --> 00:54:29,077
Goddamn it! Come on, break it up!

528
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:33,948
Break it up!

529
00:54:37,761 --> 00:54:38,887
Break it up!

530
00:54:40,664 --> 00:54:41,460
Elias, chill.

531
00:54:41,798 --> 00:54:45,734
You're dead, Elias! l swear to fucking God, you're dead!

532
00:54:46,103 --> 00:54:49,129
You! You're gonna do time in LBJ!

533
00:54:49,473 --> 00:54:51,270
This shit won't wash, you puke!

534
00:54:51,608 --> 00:54:54,771
Break it up! Break it up! Shut up!

535
00:54:55,412 --> 00:54:57,778
Break it up! Listen up!

536
00:54:58,515 --> 00:55:00,847
Captain says to torch this place, hear that?

537
00:55:01,185 --> 00:55:02,482
Torch this place!

538
00:55:02,819 --> 00:55:04,116
Blow the weapons in place!

539
00:55:04,721 --> 00:55:08,452
Round up suspected VC and shake it up! We ain't got much light left!

540
00:55:08,792 --> 00:55:11,886
Lieutenant, why the fuck didn't you do something?

541
00:55:12,262 --> 00:55:13,786
What are you talking about?

542
00:55:14,164 --> 00:55:16,530
You know what the fuck l'm talking about.

543
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:21,098
No, l don't. l don't know what the fuck you're talking about, Elias.

544
00:55:25,976 --> 00:55:28,501
Move it out! Let's go! You heard the lieutenant!

545
00:55:28,812 --> 00:55:33,044
Taylor, let's go, for chrissake! Police up the weapons and let's go!

546
00:55:33,383 --> 00:55:34,577
Come on, Harold.

547
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:12,012
Fire in the hole!

548
00:56:22,165 --> 00:56:23,962
Fire in the hole!

549
00:57:08,879 --> 00:57:10,278
Hey, come on.

550
00:57:11,348 --> 00:57:12,906
You fucker! Get out of here!

551
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:16,913
Get the fuck off! Don't do it! Don't do it!

552
00:57:17,254 --> 00:57:20,348
You fucker! What is this, huh?!

553
00:57:24,928 --> 00:57:25,917
You a homosexual?

554
00:57:26,296 --> 00:57:28,696
What's your problem? She's a fucking dink.

555
00:57:29,066 --> 00:57:32,695
She's a fucking human being, man! Fuck you!

556
00:57:33,036 --> 00:57:35,061
Total fucking cherry, Taylor!

557
00:57:35,405 --> 00:57:38,863
Fucking animal! All of you! You're fucking animals!

558
00:57:39,209 --> 00:57:41,040
Fucking lame fuck!

559
00:57:41,345 --> 00:57:43,973
You don't belong in the Nam. This ain't your place.

560
00:57:44,314 --> 00:57:46,509
You don't fucking get it, do you?

561
00:57:47,818 --> 00:57:49,718
You just don't fucking get it.

562
00:57:50,921 --> 00:57:52,115
lt's okay.

563
00:57:56,126 --> 00:57:57,855
Get out of there!

564
00:58:02,065 --> 00:58:04,056
Police up your dicks and let's go.

565
00:59:01,358 --> 00:59:03,189
-l didn't see anything, sir. -l did.

566
00:59:03,527 --> 00:59:05,995
Sergeant Barnes reported the dink as NVA.

567
00:59:06,363 --> 00:59:09,958
My report will have Lieutenant Wolfe as being witness to the shooting.

568
00:59:10,333 --> 00:59:11,732
All right, Elias.

569
00:59:12,669 --> 00:59:15,035
-Staff Sergeant Barnes. -Sir!

570
00:59:15,372 --> 00:59:18,364
l want a full report from you when we get back to the CP.

571
00:59:18,708 --> 00:59:22,735
You got a diary. l have plenty of eyewitnesses, sir.

572
00:59:23,046 --> 00:59:25,310
Not now, goddamn it! Not now!

573
00:59:25,649 --> 00:59:27,640
We'll get into this at the base camp.

574
00:59:27,984 --> 00:59:32,250
l can promise you, if l find out there was an illegal killing...

575
00:59:32,589 --> 00:59:34,250
...there will be a court-martial.

576
00:59:34,624 --> 00:59:39,721
Right now, l need every man in the field, and you two will cease fire.

577
00:59:40,096 --> 00:59:43,122
Staff Sergeant Barnes. Sergeant Elias. You hear me?

578
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:44,364
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

579
00:59:44,701 --> 00:59:48,865
We're going back into that NVA bunker tomorrow, this time from the east.

580
00:59:49,206 --> 00:59:53,802
You people get some rest, and be back here at the CP at 1 900 for a briefing.

581
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:55,338
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

582
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:05,183
Come on, man! You think these chucks give a fuck about you and me?

583
01:00:05,689 --> 01:00:08,556
lt could have been you, Harold, you got in Barnes' way.

584
01:00:09,559 --> 01:00:10,924
And that Bunny?

585
01:00:11,595 --> 01:00:13,460
That motherfucker's crazy.

586
01:00:13,930 --> 01:00:15,227
l mean, he scares me.

587
01:00:16,099 --> 01:00:17,566
He just scares me.

588
01:00:18,401 --> 01:00:20,961
You bloods are getting too hung up on this shit.

589
01:00:21,638 --> 01:00:24,129
These gooks are a lot smarter than you think.

590
01:00:24,474 --> 01:00:26,408
You know, Barnes knows his shit, man.

591
01:00:26,743 --> 01:00:29,507
They was NVA, every last of them.

592
01:00:30,447 --> 01:00:33,211
He got us this far. He'll get us the rest of the way.

593
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:34,482
l don't know, Holmes.

594
01:00:35,385 --> 01:00:38,718
A Christian don't go around a village, cutting off heads and shit.

595
01:00:39,489 --> 01:00:42,822
This shit is really getting out of hand, blowing out of control.

596
01:00:43,293 --> 01:00:46,091
Seems to me that you don't seem to know the difference...

597
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:48,761
...the way you always shoot up that shit.

598
01:00:49,766 --> 01:00:51,233
l don't know, brothers...

599
01:00:53,103 --> 01:00:55,298
...but l'm hurting real bad inside.

600
01:00:58,008 --> 01:01:01,102
Don't worry, sarge. Elias won't be able to prove a thing.

601
01:01:01,411 --> 01:01:02,378
He's a troublemaker.

602
01:01:02,712 --> 01:01:06,273
Elias is a water walker. Like them politicians in Washington...

603
01:01:06,616 --> 01:01:10,245
...trying to fight this war with one hand tied around their balls.

604
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:13,584
Ain't no need or time for a courtroom out here.

605
01:01:15,292 --> 01:01:17,852
-Sarge. -Thanks, Bun.

606
01:01:18,995 --> 01:01:20,292
How did it go there, Bob?

607
01:01:23,166 --> 01:01:26,658
Yeah, thataway, sarge! Fucking Elias, man.

608
01:01:27,003 --> 01:01:28,971
He's a fucking rat, that's what he is.

609
01:01:29,306 --> 01:01:32,139
He'll get everybody in this platoon in deep shit.

610
01:01:32,542 --> 01:01:34,703
Somebody ought to frag his ass.

611
01:01:35,111 --> 01:01:38,547
So, what do you think? Gonna be an investigation or what?

612
01:01:40,216 --> 01:01:41,080
Bob?

613
01:01:42,619 --> 01:01:46,385
O'Neill, you worry too much. Sarge will take care of him.

614
01:01:52,896 --> 01:01:54,261
lt's a beautiful night.

615
01:01:54,631 --> 01:01:56,030
Yeah, l love this place at night.

616
01:01:57,968 --> 01:01:59,333
The stars....

617
01:02:02,105 --> 01:02:06,041
There's no right or wrong in them. They're just there.

618
01:02:06,977 --> 01:02:08,842
That's a nice way of putting it.

619
01:02:13,917 --> 01:02:15,509
Barnes has it in for you, huh?

620
01:02:16,419 --> 01:02:18,717
Barnes believes in what he's doing.

621
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:22,522
And you? Do you believe?

622
01:02:25,862 --> 01:02:28,387
ln '65? Yeah.

623
01:02:30,367 --> 01:02:31,493
Now?

624
01:02:34,304 --> 01:02:35,293
No.

625
01:02:38,742 --> 01:02:41,370
What happened today is just the beginning.

626
01:02:42,946 --> 01:02:44,709
We're gonna lose this war.

627
01:02:45,548 --> 01:02:47,015
Come on.

628
01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:49,910
You really think so? Us?

629
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:53,582
We've been kicking other people's asses for so long...

630
01:02:53,923 --> 01:02:56,153
...l figure it's time we got ours kicked.

631
01:03:06,903 --> 01:03:09,201
Day by day, I struggle to maintain...

632
01:03:09,539 --> 01:03:12,099
...not only my strength, but my sanity,

633
01:03:12,442 --> 01:03:14,000
It's all a blur,

634
01:03:14,310 --> 01:03:16,210
I have no energy to write,

635
01:03:16,713 --> 01:03:19,113
I don't know what's right or wrong anymore,

636
01:03:19,716 --> 01:03:23,243
The morale of the men is low, A civil war in the platoon,

637
01:03:23,586 --> 01:03:26,054
Half the men with Elias, half with Barnes,

638
01:03:26,990 --> 01:03:29,083
There's a lot of suspicion and hate,

639
01:03:29,492 --> 01:03:33,155
I can't believe we're fighting each other instead of them,

640
01:03:35,432 --> 01:03:39,892
Counting days and the six inches in front of my face, Not much else,

641
01:03:40,570 --> 01:03:42,538

Get Barnes! Elias, we got four down. What do you want me to do?

There's holes back here, 3rd Platoon's coming up here, we're here!

673
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:20,089
Dinks get in these holes, we'll be in a crossfire.

674
01:07:20,423 --> 01:07:22,983
-We'll shoot each other. -Sounds far-out to me.

675

You got them! Take off!

l don't want to be stuck out there with my ass hanging in the breeze.

680
01:07:38,741 --> 01:07:41,403
You don't tell me how to run my war, Elias.

681
01:07:41,711 --> 01:07:45,044

You ignorant asshole!

709

What the fuck coordinates are you giving?

710

You wasted a lot of people up there with your fucked-up fire mission!

711
01:10:50,233 --> 01:10:51,598
Do you know that?

712
01:10:52,869 --> 01:10:55,667
Do you know that? Ah, shit!

Stagger yourself across this line. Shoot anything that moves.

717
01:11:23,599 --> 01:11:25,464
They'll be coming from over there.

718
01:11:26,636 --> 01:11:29,969
Any one of them gets through, we are truly fucked.

719
01:11:30,506 --> 01:11:31,996
Where the hell are you going?

720
01:11:32,675 --> 01:11:35,769
Down by the river about 1 00 meters...

721
01:11:36,078 --> 01:11:37,568
...in case they try to flank us.

722
01:11:37,914 --> 01:11:40,508
3rd Platoon is coming behind us. Watch for them.

723

01:16:51,126 --> 01:16:52,388
Elias is dead.

01:16:56,465 --> 01:16:57,489
He's dead?

753
01:16:58,234 --> 01:17:00,566
Yeah, he's back there about 1 00 meters.

754
01:17:00,903 --> 01:17:02,632
You saw him? Where?

Snake 1-9, Fly 4, There's still one of the men down there,

764
01:20:09,162 --> 01:20:11,187
Hold your arms, Guns, hold off,

765
01:21:10,156 --> 01:21:11,384
He killed him.

l know he did. l saw his eyes when he came in.

767
01:21:15,695 --> 01:21:18,994
How do you know the dinks didn't get him? You got no proof.

768
01:21:19,332 --> 01:21:21,630
Proof's in the eyes. When you know, you know.

769
01:21:21,968 --> 01:21:24,027
You saw. l know what you were thinking.

770
01:21:24,371 --> 01:21:25,895

l say let military justice do the job on him.

773
01:21:32,679 --> 01:21:36,171
Come on, fuck the military justice! Are you joking me?

774
01:21:36,516 --> 01:21:40,509
Whose story you think they'll believe? O'Neill's? Bunny's? Bullshit!

775
01:21:40,854 --> 01:21:44,915
You try that, Barnes will shove it back up your ass, with a candle on it.

776
01:21:45,258 --> 01:21:46,919
What do you suggest we do?

777
01:21:47,260 --> 01:21:52,254
Watch your own asses. Barnes will be coming down on all of them.

778
01:21:52,599 --> 01:21:55,762
You gonna forget about Elias? All the good times we had here?

779
01:21:56,102 --> 01:21:59,663
Shit, you trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head.

780
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:03,341
Elias didn't ask you to fight his battles for him.

781
01:22:04,277 --> 01:22:07,838
And if there's a heaven, and God, l hope there is...

782
01:22:08,181 --> 01:22:12,845
...he's sitting up there drunk as a fucking monkey and smoking shit...

783
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:15,821
...because he left his pains down here.

784
01:22:16,156 --> 01:22:19,387
You're wrong! Anyway you cut it, Barnes is a murderer!

785
01:22:19,726 --> 01:22:21,660
-Right on. -Taylor...

786
01:22:22,796 --> 01:22:27,199
...when you first came in here, you told me how you admired the bastard.

787
01:22:27,534 --> 01:22:31,732
-l was wrong. -You've never been right about nothing!

788
01:22:32,939 --> 01:22:35,237
Dig this, you assholes, and dig it good.

789
01:22:36,643 --> 01:22:39,476
Barnes been shot seven times, and he ain't dead.

790
01:22:39,813 --> 01:22:41,678
Does that mean anything to you?

791
01:22:42,649 --> 01:22:44,412
Barnes ain't meant to die.

792
01:22:45,819 --> 01:22:49,220
The only thing that can kill Barnes is Barnes.

793
01:22:50,023 --> 01:22:51,650
Talking about killing?

794
01:23:04,370 --> 01:23:05,837
You all experts?

795
01:23:08,308 --> 01:23:10,003
You all know about killing?

796
01:23:11,478 --> 01:23:13,912
Well, l'd like to hear about it, potheads.

797
01:23:21,287 --> 01:23:24,279
You smoke this shit to escape from reality?

798
01:23:27,227 --> 01:23:29,058
Me, l don't need this shit.

799
01:23:35,768 --> 01:23:37,497
l am reality.

800
01:23:44,010 --> 01:23:47,502
There's the way it ought to be, and there's the way it is.

801
01:23:51,751 --> 01:23:53,309
Elias was full of shit.

802
01:23:55,421 --> 01:23:57,218
Elias was a crusader.

803
01:23:58,892 --> 01:24:02,828
Now, l got no fight with any man who does what he's told.

804
01:24:03,429 --> 01:24:04,828
But when he don't...

805
01:24:05,164 --> 01:24:06,893
...the machine breaks down.

806
01:24:07,867 --> 01:24:12,031
And when the machine breaks down, we break down.

807
01:24:13,273 --> 01:24:15,207
l ain't going to allow that.

808
01:24:15,909 --> 01:24:17,171
From any of you.

809
01:24:18,678 --> 01:24:19,872
Not one.

810
01:24:36,696 --> 01:24:38,459
You all love Elias.

811
01:24:43,903 --> 01:24:45,962
You want to kick ass.

812
01:24:51,911 --> 01:24:55,210
Well, here l am. All by my lonesome.

813
01:24:58,151 --> 01:25:00,142
And ain't nobody gonna know.

814
01:25:06,392 --> 01:25:08,326
Six of you boys against me.

815
01:25:14,834 --> 01:25:15,926
Kill me.

816
01:25:34,053 --> 01:25:35,987
l shit on all of you.

817
01:25:38,825 --> 01:25:40,793
You motherfucker!

818
01:25:47,033 --> 01:25:48,227
Come on, man.

819
01:25:49,268 --> 01:25:50,462
Get him, Chris.

820
01:25:54,907 --> 01:25:57,137
Easy, Barnes. Don't do it, man!

821
01:25:57,510 --> 01:25:59,705
You'll go dinky dau in LBJ, man.

822
01:26:00,079 --> 01:26:03,014
Ten years for killing an enlisted man. Ten years.

823
01:26:03,349 --> 01:26:05,078
Climb the fucking walls, man.

824
01:26:07,687 --> 01:26:09,154
Don't do it.

825
01:26:27,607 --> 01:26:28,665
Death?

826
01:26:29,809 --> 01:26:31,800
What do you all know about death?

827
01:26:46,893 --> 01:26:49,361
They sent us baCk into the valley the next day...

828
01:26:49,696 --> 01:26:53,427
...about 2000 meters from Cambodia into a battalion perimeter,

829
01:26:53,766 --> 01:26:56,599
It felt like we were returning to the sCene of a Crime,

830
01:27:31,237 --> 01:27:34,729
Alpha Company had been hit hard the day before by a sizable forCe,

831
01:27:35,074 --> 01:27:37,338
Charlie Company had been probed that night,

832
01:27:38,044 --> 01:27:40,672
There were other battalions in the valley...

833
01:27:41,013 --> 01:27:43,880
...but we knew we were the bait to lure them out,

834
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:48,779
Somewhere out there was the entire 1 4 1 st NVA regiment,

835
01:28:06,405 --> 01:28:10,705
Caught them trying to pull some shit on Charlie Company last night.

836
01:28:11,077 --> 01:28:13,045
They found maps on them, man.

837
01:28:13,746 --> 01:28:18,080
Got a friend at Battalion, says they had every foxhole here fixed on.

838
01:28:18,384 --> 01:28:22,821
Distances, tree lines, our claymores, everything.

839
01:28:23,156 --> 01:28:24,714
This is bad, man.

840
01:28:25,792 --> 01:28:29,489
-l got bad vibes here. -l also heard we're in Cambodia now.

841
01:28:29,829 --> 01:28:32,389
Cambodia? Man, you're kidding me.

842
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:34,860
You wanted to see me, sir?

843
01:28:36,669 --> 01:28:39,832
Yeah, Ramucci. Looks like you got Elias' squad now.

844
01:28:40,173 --> 01:28:44,041
Squad? l didn't know we were still referring to this platoon as squads.

845
01:28:44,410 --> 01:28:48,710
l want you to take those two holes, right there and there.

846
01:28:49,015 --> 01:28:51,813
Tie it off with Barnes up here and King down there.

847
01:28:53,452 --> 01:28:55,147
Begging your pardon, sir...

848
01:28:55,688 --> 01:28:59,124
...my two holes are so far apart, a regiment could run between them.

849
01:28:59,458 --> 01:29:01,016
l have five live bodies left.

850
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:04,887
l don't want to hear your problems. You'll get new men any day.

851
01:29:05,231 --> 01:29:06,858
Make do like everybody else.

852
01:29:07,266 --> 01:29:09,632
-l didn't ask for this. -l don't want to hear it.

853
01:29:09,969 --> 01:29:12,164
-You don't want to hear it? -That's right.

854
01:29:12,872 --> 01:29:15,807
Because, to tell you the truth, l don't give a shit.

855
01:29:16,642 --> 01:29:18,837
l just don't give a flying fuck anymore.

856
01:29:26,619 --> 01:29:28,450
l'm glad l ain't going with them.

857
01:29:30,857 --> 01:29:33,826
Somewhere out there is the beast and he hungry tonight.

858
01:29:34,994 --> 01:29:36,291
What a fucking bummer.

859
01:29:37,663 --> 01:29:40,860
Ten days and a wake-up, and l'm still dealing with this shit.

860
01:29:44,437 --> 01:29:46,029
What's the matter with you?

861
01:29:47,006 --> 01:29:48,564
Why ain't you writing nobody?

862
01:29:49,375 --> 01:29:50,865
What about your folks?

863
01:29:52,211 --> 01:29:53,769
That grandma you told me about?

864
01:29:56,415 --> 01:29:57,347
Girl?

865
01:30:00,419 --> 01:30:01,716
You got parents, don't you?

866
01:30:02,355 --> 01:30:03,879
There must be somebody.

867
01:30:05,091 --> 01:30:06,820
No, there's nobody.

868
01:30:08,561 --> 01:30:10,893
You been smoking too much of this shit.

869
01:30:13,299 --> 01:30:15,767
Gotta control that. Bring a man down.

870
01:30:16,802 --> 01:30:20,670
l remember when you first come out here to the bush, you's green as--

871
01:30:21,807 --> 01:30:25,299
You ever get caught in a mistake you just can't get out of?

872
01:30:26,379 --> 01:30:28,244
There's a way out of anything.

873
01:30:29,015 --> 01:30:31,984
Just keep your pecker hard and your powder dry...

874
01:30:32,351 --> 01:30:34,216
...and the worm will turn.

875
01:30:37,223 --> 01:30:38,713
How many days you short?

876
01:30:40,026 --> 01:30:43,553
lt's not just me. lt's how the whole thing works.

877
01:30:43,896 --> 01:30:45,523
People like Elias get wasted.

878
01:30:45,865 --> 01:30:49,562
People like Barnes go on making up all the rules any way they want.

879
01:30:49,902 --> 01:30:53,599
So, what do we do? Sit in the middle and suck on it.

880
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:56,838
We just don't add up to dry shit.

881
01:30:57,343 --> 01:31:01,939
Whoever said we did? All you got to do is make it out of here...

882
01:31:02,281 --> 01:31:06,581
...and it's all gravy. Every day, the rest of your life. Gravy.

883
01:31:09,956 --> 01:31:11,947
Oh, shit. Superlifer.

884
01:31:13,225 --> 01:31:16,217
Collect up your shit. Your orders just come through.

885
01:31:16,562 --> 01:31:17,859
Man, don't fuck with me.

886
01:31:18,197 --> 01:31:20,791
Oh, what do you need, a written invitation?

887
01:31:21,233 --> 01:31:25,693
Cocksucker! Oh, wow! The lifers done made a mistake!

888
01:31:26,038 --> 01:31:27,505
They cut me some slack!

889
01:31:27,807 --> 01:31:31,504
You got 1 0 minutes to make the last fucking chopper out of here.

890
01:31:31,877 --> 01:31:33,435
Because if you're not on it...

891
01:31:34,013 --> 01:31:35,310
...l'm gonna be.

892
01:31:36,482 --> 01:31:38,416
Taylor, Francis is coming up.

893
01:31:39,085 --> 01:31:42,418
That's great, King, l'm happy for you. Take it on home for me.

894
01:31:42,755 --> 01:31:45,952
You got my address. You know where to reach me anytime.

895
01:31:46,459 --> 01:31:49,019
l gotta di di, Don't want to miss that chopper.

896
01:31:53,332 --> 01:31:55,664
-You okay? -Yeah, l'm okay.

897
01:31:56,535 --> 01:31:57,729
Remember, take it easy.

898
01:31:58,270 --> 01:32:00,670
Don't think too much. Don't you be no fool.

899
01:32:01,374 --> 01:32:04,639
Remember, ain't no such thing as a coward out here.

900
01:32:05,444 --> 01:32:06,672
My man.

901
01:32:14,353 --> 01:32:15,820
l'll walk you out, man.

902
01:32:21,327 --> 01:32:22,316
Take it easy, King.

903
01:32:22,661 --> 01:32:25,129
-l'll take it any way l can get it. -l hear you. Later.

904
01:32:26,699 --> 01:32:29,293
l'm pretty fucked up, sarge. Don't touch it!

905
01:32:29,935 --> 01:32:31,800
l gotta get on the chopper, man.

906
01:32:32,171 --> 01:32:34,639
-So, what's the problem? -Says he can't walk.

907
01:32:35,508 --> 01:32:37,100
Shit.

908
01:32:38,310 --> 01:32:39,242
Martin...

909
01:32:40,012 --> 01:32:41,377
...get your boots on.

910
01:32:44,550 --> 01:32:48,816
And the next time l catch you spraying skeeter repellent on your feet...

911
01:32:49,155 --> 01:32:51,555
...l'll court-martial your nigger ass.

912
01:32:52,658 --> 01:32:54,649
Then court-martial me, motherfucker!

913
01:32:54,994 --> 01:32:57,326
Bust my ass! Send me to fucking Long Binh!

914
01:32:58,330 --> 01:32:59,456
Do your fucking worst!

915
01:33:00,299 --> 01:33:03,200
You white folks got your last klick out of Junior!

916
01:33:04,236 --> 01:33:06,602
O'Neill, get me that centipede.

917
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:08,805
-Sarge? -Yeah.

918
01:33:09,141 --> 01:33:13,840
That long, hairy, red and black bastard l found in the ammo crate.

919
01:33:15,614 --> 01:33:17,582
l'm gonna put it in this boy's crotch.

920
01:33:17,983 --> 01:33:18,847
l remember now.

921
01:33:20,853 --> 01:33:22,184
Hold up, man!

922
01:33:22,521 --> 01:33:24,250
You just hold up and wait, okay?

923
01:33:24,590 --> 01:33:27,115
Fuck it, l'll walk! l'll fucking walk!

924
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:30,054
Fucking pussy! Sarge, l gotta have him in my hole?

925
01:33:30,396 --> 01:33:31,556
Yeah.

926
01:33:31,964 --> 01:33:34,524
Bob, l'd like to speak to you a minute.

927
01:33:39,472 --> 01:33:40,962
l can't take it no more.

928
01:33:45,044 --> 01:33:46,011
Yeah, what is it?

929
01:33:46,378 --> 01:33:49,472
Bob, l got Elias' R and R. lt's coming up in three days.

930
01:33:49,815 --> 01:33:52,477
l was thinking about going to Hawaii and see Patsy.

931
01:33:53,052 --> 01:33:55,145
l never asked you for a thing over here.

932
01:33:55,488 --> 01:33:57,456
Well, to be honest with you...

933
01:33:57,790 --> 01:34:01,282
...l was hoping you'd put me on a chopper with King. What do you say?

934
01:34:01,927 --> 01:34:03,189
l can't do that for you.

935
01:34:03,529 --> 01:34:06,157
You know we need every swinging dick in the field.

936
01:34:06,499 --> 01:34:09,866
You can talk to me, for chrissake! l'm just asking for three days.

937
01:34:10,202 --> 01:34:12,727
l am talking to you, Red. And l'm telling you no.

938
01:34:13,839 --> 01:34:15,602
Get back in your foxhole.

939
01:34:16,041 --> 01:34:19,636
Bob, l've got a bad feeling on this one, all right?

940
01:34:20,246 --> 01:34:22,407
l mean l've got a bad feeling.

941
01:34:23,182 --> 01:34:25,480
l don't think l'm gonna make it out of here.

942
01:34:25,818 --> 01:34:27,683
You understand what l'm saying?

943
01:34:28,888 --> 01:34:31,516
Everybody gotta die sometime, Red.

944
01:34:39,498 --> 01:34:40,226
Oh, shit!

945
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:58,114
Goodbye, motherfuckers!

946
01:35:10,396 --> 01:35:12,387
Where's that fucking ambush?

947
01:35:13,098 --> 01:35:17,398
They ain't even waiting till later. lt's fucking coming now, man.

948
01:35:17,736 --> 01:35:19,727
Right fucking now.

949
01:35:24,610 --> 01:35:27,909
You know, Junior? Some of the things we done, man...

950
01:35:28,614 --> 01:35:30,844
...l don't feel like we done something wrong.

951
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:33,176
But sometimes, man...

952
01:35:35,254 --> 01:35:37,188
...l get this bad feeling.

953
01:35:40,359 --> 01:35:42,554
l told the padre the truth. l like it here.

954
01:35:42,895 --> 01:35:45,659
You get to do what you want, nobody fucks with you.

955
01:35:46,065 --> 01:35:48,363
The only worry you got is dying.

956
01:35:48,834 --> 01:35:51,064
And if that happens, you won't know about it...

957
01:35:51,403 --> 01:35:53,268

What's going on? Rodriguez's hole just got nailed.

977
01:38:28,227 --> 01:38:30,787
Here it is. We got gooks in the fucking perimeter.

You can do better than that!

1011
01:42:34,539 --> 01:42:37,440
They just keep coming, man! Fuck this shit.

1012

Charlie Company reports hand-to-hand, three holes are down. They need help.

1015
01:43:46,445 --> 01:43:49,676
Okay, get two squads from Alpha down there right away. Go, go!

Hey, you two! Where the fuck are you going?

-Come on, Elmo. -Doc, we got wounded here!

1049
01:51:08,253 --> 01:51:10,721
That must have been some fucking fight.

1050
01:51:12,090 --> 01:51:13,557
You alone here, man?

1051
01:51:14,726 --> 01:51:15,693
Yeah.

1052
01:51:16,761 --> 01:51:19,229
Bunch of fucking faggots. They all left me.

1053
01:52:08,413 --> 01:52:12,042
1 22 wounded and still counting.

1054
01:52:12,383 --> 01:52:13,475

01:52:13,818 --> 01:52:17,948
...Victor Charlie K.l.A. 22 and still counting. Over.

1056
01:52:25,530 --> 01:52:26,497

1057
01:52:27,365 --> 01:52:28,229
Hey, Francis.

1058
01:52:28,566 --> 01:52:31,467
-Hey, man, how you doing? -l'm okay. How you doing?

1059
01:52:31,803 --> 01:52:32,827
Fine, man. Just fine.

1060
01:52:33,171 --> 01:52:36,402
Hey, dig it, we two-timers. We're gonna get out of here, boy.

1061
01:52:36,741 --> 01:52:40,507
l'm gonna see you in the hospital. We gonna get high, high. Yes, sir.

1062
01:52:43,982 --> 01:52:45,813
-How you doing? -l'm just fine, sir.

1063
01:52:46,150 --> 01:52:48,175

01:53:00,999 --> 01:53:02,660
-Ready? -You bet.

1066
01:54:32,123 --> 01:54:34,387
I think now, looking baCk...

1067
01:54:35,860 --> 01:54:39,591
...we did not fight the enemy, we fought ourselves...

1068
01:54:39,931 --> 01:54:42,195
...and the enemy was in us,

1069
01:54:44,502 --> 01:54:46,527
The war is over for me now...

1070
01:54:46,871 --> 01:54:50,671
...but it will always be there the rest of my days,

1071
01:54:51,209 --> 01:54:53,109
As I'm sure Elias will be...

1072
01:54:53,611 --> 01:54:56,944
...fighting with Barnes for, what Rhah Called, possession of my soul,

1073
01:54:59,517 --> 01:55:00,916
There are times sinCe...

1074
01:55:01,285 --> 01:55:05,312
...I have felt like the Child born of those two fathers,

1075
01:55:07,892 --> 01:55:09,723
But be that as it may...

1076
01:55:10,428 --> 01:55:14,023
...those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again,

1077
01:55:14,799 --> 01:55:16,926
To teaCh to others what we know...

1078
01:55:18,336 --> 01:55:20,930
...and to try with what's left of our lives...

1079
01:55:21,272 --> 01:55:25,003
...to find a goodness and meaning to this life,
