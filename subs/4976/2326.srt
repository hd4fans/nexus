They ain't come back for the cocaine.
They came back for the base.

00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,889
All right, let me think about this
a little bit.

115

We going to come off like the Mob.
You understand what l'm saying?

123
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,517
You going to frisk me too?

124
00:10:45,482 --> 00:10:49,812
Yo, my boy, Nino in the house.
Yo, Nino. What's up?

125
00:10:52,907 --> 00:10:54,567
You want a flower?

What's up, crew?

128
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,649
Nino, your girl looks good.

129
00:11:34,577 --> 00:11:36,570
You must like slumming, Kareem.

130
00:11:37,622 --> 00:11:41,999
Why would a guy like you leave
a good computer job at the bank...

131

...come all the way uptown

132

...to work among a den of thieves?

133
00:11:47,591 --> 00:11:48,540
l'm no dummy.

134
00:11:48,967 --> 00:11:51,007
lt's basic common sense and arithmetic.

135
00:11:51,261 --> 00:11:54,381
The difference between
them paying me $800 a week...

136
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,929
...and you paying me $8,000 a week.

137

138
00:11:59,312 --> 00:12:02,147
...that you're in the tradition
of Joe Kennedy.

139
00:12:02,398 --> 00:12:03,478
Who?

140
00:12:05,193 --> 00:12:09,737
Good. Because you got to rob
to get rich in the Reagan era.

141
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:13,034
They running a strange program.

142
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:16,780
More poor and disenfranchised folks
than this place has ever seen.

143
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:19,288
They try to act like it don't exist.

144
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:22,709
-Meanwhile, the rich get richer--
-And the poor get nothing.

145
00:12:22,962 --> 00:12:26,960
Times like these, people want
to get high. Real high and real fast.

146
00:12:27,217 --> 00:12:28,676
And this is going to do it.

147
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:32,676
And make us rich.

148
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:38,136
l mean, what?
People going crazy over this?

149
00:12:38,563 --> 00:12:41,350
lt look like cracked-off
pieces of soap.

150
00:12:43,193 --> 00:12:45,814
The Colombians and Dominicans
have shown us the way.

151
00:12:46,071 --> 00:12:47,980
The shit is large.

152
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:50,274
But we'll do it differently.

153
00:12:50,534 --> 00:12:52,574
No more selling on street corners.

154
00:12:52,828 --> 00:12:55,782
Change the product,
you change the marketing strategy.

155
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,700
l've seen the future.

156
00:12:58,501 --> 00:13:01,206
And its name is The Carter.

157
00:13:01,587 --> 00:13:04,921
Hold up. The Carter Apartments,
that joint is big.

158
00:13:05,216 --> 00:13:08,882
We're talking about
combinating and consolidating.

159
00:13:09,429 --> 00:13:11,505
You're taking over The Carter?

160
00:13:11,765 --> 00:13:16,178
We taking over The Carter. We going to
bum rush the whole damn thing.

161
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:21,023
Now just imagine,
if the tenants cooperate, it's lovely.

162
00:13:21,275 --> 00:13:23,434
They become loyal customers.

163
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,612
lf they don't, it's like Beirut.
They become live-in hostages.

164
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:32,492
We going to set up a lab here,
to make the product.

165
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:37,455
You hook up the computer, watch the
workers, the money and the product.

166
00:13:37,793 --> 00:13:40,000
The Duh Duh Man, Keisha,
we need security...

167
00:13:40,296 --> 00:13:42,704
...to ward off the rival crews,
to screen out customers.

168
00:13:42,965 --> 00:13:44,757
We also need lookouts...

169
00:13:45,134 --> 00:13:47,542
...here, here and here.

170
00:13:47,929 --> 00:13:49,471
Alert us of five-o.

171
00:13:50,307 --> 00:13:55,099
One place to make the product.
One place to collect our money.

172
00:13:56,522 --> 00:13:58,182
We will own this fucking city.

173
00:13:58,441 --> 00:14:02,141
You's a genius, man. A pure, un--

174
00:14:04,238 --> 00:14:08,568
Unadulterated. Would you please shut
the fuck up before you have a seizure?

175
00:14:08,994 --> 00:14:11,200
Hey, man, suck my...

176
00:14:11,413 --> 00:14:12,741
...dick!

177
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:15,908
lt's a brilliant plan.

178
00:14:16,168 --> 00:14:18,244
But one thing concerns me.

179
00:14:18,587 --> 00:14:21,672
That curry-goat-eating, skinny-ass,
Fat Smitty.

180
00:14:22,049 --> 00:14:25,668
He controls The Carter.
Time to sing that fat bitch a lullaby.

181
00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:27,471
Rock-a-bye baby.

182
00:14:27,722 --> 00:14:29,430
He'll be hanging with Elvis.

183
00:14:31,726 --> 00:14:32,675
Damn.

184
00:14:34,104 --> 00:14:35,267
Crack.

185
00:14:43,865 --> 00:14:48,574
Sell my stuff
and stop talking to that bitch!

186
00:14:50,038 --> 00:14:51,616
Let me speak with you.

187
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:55,750
Rastaman, l'm here to tell you
Nino Brown says...

188
00:14:56,003 --> 00:14:59,372
...your services are no longer
needed in the community.

189
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:07,299
That's how you kill somebody.
Get up on the motherfucker and blam!

190
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:12,060
Blow his brains all over the sidewalk,
in broad daylight.

191
00:15:12,354 --> 00:15:13,729
Rock-a-bye baby.

192
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,979
Brother, l think there's been
a little misunderstanding.

193
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:22,691
Now look, you are going to give up
those apartments, huh?

194
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:26,276
And you are going to turn over
control of The Carter.

195
00:15:26,869 --> 00:15:28,696
Because if you don't...

196
00:15:28,955 --> 00:15:31,956
...this shotgun blows your big,
fat head off...

197
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:35,126
...before you can get
your clothes back on.

198
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,618

what will you say "yes" to?

00:18:05,749 --> 00:18:08,419
We say "yes" to education.

223
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:11,623
We say "yes" to dedication.
We climb up...

...to a higher station
of new spiritual motivation...

00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,563
...right under your noses.

229
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,996
lf you lived in The Carter Apartments,
there'd be cops all over the place.

230
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:45,208
Hey, don't walk away. Listen to me!

231
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:49,706
l fought for this country. We pay taxes
and we're prisoners in our home.

232
00:18:52,258 --> 00:18:55,259
l told the commissioner
you were running late.

233
00:18:55,887 --> 00:18:58,508
-You got those files?
-Right here.

234
00:19:05,856 --> 00:19:07,398
Let's hope he buys it.

235
00:19:09,151 --> 00:19:11,358
Peretti and Appleton?
No way, Stone.

236
00:19:11,612 --> 00:19:12,644
Who else you got?

237
00:19:12,905 --> 00:19:14,732
-They're the ones l need.
-You kidding me?

238
00:19:15,033 --> 00:19:17,524
Nick Peretti almost killed
his partner.

239
00:19:17,744 --> 00:19:19,820
Scotty Appleton's on suspension.

240
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:20,987
Probation.

241
00:19:21,248 --> 00:19:22,872
Semantics, Stone.

242
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,084
These two are trouble.

243
00:19:27,671 --> 00:19:31,337
You and l know the system
wasn't ready for this epidemic.

244
00:19:31,592 --> 00:19:34,130
Crack came on the scene
and spread like wildfire.

245
00:19:34,387 --> 00:19:37,139
Now l got the mayor
and the governor on my back.

246
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:40,095
l need some results.
Fast!

247
00:19:40,352 --> 00:19:42,225
You get me Nino Brown!

248
00:19:42,479 --> 00:19:46,014
Forget Peretti and Appleton.
The risk is too high.

249
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,937
With all due respect, sir...

250
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:51,857
...you still don't get it.

251
00:19:52,281 --> 00:19:55,448
You're not giving me what l need
to win this war:

252
00:19:55,701 --> 00:19:57,575
Cops that know these streets.

253
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:00,402
l need new jack cops
for a new jack gangster.

254
00:20:00,707 --> 00:20:04,491
What you call a risk,
l think is our only shot.

255
00:20:04,753 --> 00:20:05,666
Let's go.

256
00:20:15,223 --> 00:20:16,598
You got your men.

257
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:21,763
But l don't want any waves.

258
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:25,183
Not a goddamn ripple.

261
00:20:58,686 --> 00:21:03,812
This is Detective Nick Peretti,
a motorcycle-freak, reject cop like you.

262
00:21:04,276 --> 00:21:06,019
A wild man that no one wants.

263
00:21:06,278 --> 00:21:08,354
He means l'm expendable.

264
00:21:08,614 --> 00:21:12,398
Whatever, man. What did you
come here for? To watch me exercise?

265
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,530
l came here to lay a name on you.
Nino Brown?

266
00:21:15,788 --> 00:21:17,413
His sidekick, Gerald "Gee Money" Wells?

267
00:21:17,665 --> 00:21:21,497
-The "Cash Money Brothers. "
-Stuck up two-bit jewelry stores.

268
00:21:22,253 --> 00:21:26,714
Yeah, thrill-seekers, wannabe
gangsters. l hate them. So what's up?

269
00:21:26,967 --> 00:21:29,540
What's up is this:
We need some evidence.

270
00:21:29,845 --> 00:21:32,087
Evidence of murder,
drug trafficking...

271
00:21:32,348 --> 00:21:35,218
...racketeering, tax evasion.
Anything.

272
00:21:35,685 --> 00:21:38,555
We've never been able
to make anything stick on Brown.

273
00:21:39,105 --> 00:21:41,513
No shit. One-third of the department's
on Nino's payroll.

274
00:21:41,774 --> 00:21:44,729
The other two-thirds don't care
unless it affects their community.

275
00:21:44,986 --> 00:21:46,149
What you saying?

276
00:21:46,696 --> 00:21:49,816
Listen.
l've been authorized to set up...

277
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:52,827
...an independent drug-fighting unit
and l'm picking you.

278
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,071
-Why me?
-What do you mean, why you?

279
00:21:55,331 --> 00:21:58,118
You're from the neighborhood.
l can trust you.

280
00:21:58,334 --> 00:22:00,410
And l know you give a shit.

281
00:22:01,296 --> 00:22:02,790
So what's the catch?

282
00:22:03,798 --> 00:22:06,586
There's no catch.
Why you got to say that?

283
00:22:06,843 --> 00:22:10,972
-Because l know your ass, Stone.
-Peretti goes with you.

284
00:22:11,306 --> 00:22:13,429
This big, biscuit-head looking--

285
00:22:14,393 --> 00:22:17,976
Listen! lt won't be another
one of your wild-ass solo acts.

286
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:21,600
Peretti's the only cop l could find
crazy enough to team with you.

287
00:22:22,694 --> 00:22:24,188
This is my shot.

288
00:22:24,446 --> 00:22:27,067
And you fuck up, it's all on me.

289
00:22:29,409 --> 00:22:34,036
l want to thank you because you know
l want to get back in this war.

290
00:22:34,623 --> 00:22:36,581
But this guy, man... .

291
00:22:38,544 --> 00:22:39,575
You in or out?

292
00:22:40,922 --> 00:22:42,546
l'm in, all right?

293
00:22:49,222 --> 00:22:52,722
What do you mean,
Frazier won't give up the apartments?

294
00:22:53,018 --> 00:22:55,723
l'm not asking him, l'm telling him!

295
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,815
l'll handle that fat bastard myself.

296
00:23:02,904 --> 00:23:05,573
-We're honored.
-No, l'm honored. Really.

297
00:23:11,371 --> 00:23:14,289
We understand you have
a new Peruvian connection.

298
00:23:15,751 --> 00:23:17,245
So what of it?

299
00:23:17,545 --> 00:23:20,629
We know you're centralizing
operations at The Carter.

300
00:23:20,923 --> 00:23:25,799
And you didn't notify Don Armeteo,
who takes such things as an insult.

301
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:29,720
Your point?

302
00:23:29,933 --> 00:23:34,844
My point is you fucking guys are cutting
us out of our agreed upon 10% .

303
00:23:36,732 --> 00:23:38,357
lt's time we renegotiate.

304
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:43,069
l tell you what, message boy.

305
00:23:44,032 --> 00:23:46,320
You go back and tell Don Armeteo:

306
00:23:47,076 --> 00:23:49,449
"No renegotiating. " Fuck that!

307
00:23:50,163 --> 00:23:54,208
The Cash Money Brothers
are a self-contained unit now.

308
00:23:54,543 --> 00:23:56,868
But you come see me next week.

309
00:23:57,129 --> 00:24:01,174
And l'll hook you up with some
collard green linguinis and shit.

310
00:24:02,552 --> 00:24:05,921
Chicken Alfredo. Chitlins Alfredo.

311
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:09,558
Maybe get a better suit!

312
00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:11,352
Fuck you.

313
00:24:14,648 --> 00:24:16,890
Nino, l don't know.

314
00:24:17,276 --> 00:24:19,518
Frankie's an all-right guy.

315
00:24:19,778 --> 00:24:22,566
Fuck them <i>scungili</i> -eating
motherfuckers.

316
00:24:22,823 --> 00:24:27,402
This is ours. They don't want
to roll with it, we'll roll over them.

317
00:24:43,471 --> 00:24:45,179
This <i>moolanyan...</i>

318
00:24:45,389 --> 00:24:49,340
...must have an MX missile instead
of a cock, he gets up so high.

319
00:24:54,816 --> 00:24:56,359
Our snitch was right.

320
00:24:56,652 --> 00:24:58,561
Nino and his Cash Money monkeys...

321
00:24:58,821 --> 00:25:02,272
...are dealing with the spicaroos
up on Broadway and 171 st.

322
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:04,526
He don't even deny it.

323
00:25:04,827 --> 00:25:07,283
Nor does he accept
our partnership no more.

324
00:25:07,664 --> 00:25:09,906
Now, Gee Money, he was cool.

325
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:12,832
lt was that <i>testa dura,</i> Nino.

326
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:19,627
You know what l say?

327
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:23,089
Lay down with Peruvian dogs,
you get Spanish fleas.

328
00:25:23,305 --> 00:25:25,345
Soon Nino will itch.

329
00:25:25,892 --> 00:25:28,893
We'll be there
to scratch the hell out of him.

330
00:25:35,652 --> 00:25:37,194
1700 hours.

331
00:25:37,487 --> 00:25:40,987
Suspects hand out consumables
and the natives are restless.

332
00:25:41,241 --> 00:25:43,365
Yo, shut the fuck up, man!

333
00:25:44,286 --> 00:25:46,279
Ten years as a low-life,
murderous bum.

334
00:25:46,581 --> 00:25:50,994
Nino's purchasing a conscience.
l ain't buying this Robin Hood shit.

335
00:25:52,003 --> 00:25:54,708
Oh, shit!
That's the kid l shot!

336
00:25:56,091 --> 00:26:00,255
Why don't you lose weight? You look
like a boiled yam wearing a belt!

337
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:13,940
What's up? Glad to see
somebody cares about the needy.

338
00:26:14,194 --> 00:26:16,068
Why don't you give me a turkey?

339
00:26:16,321 --> 00:26:21,233
Look at your funky, black ass.
First you want to be a stickup kid.

340
00:26:21,744 --> 00:26:24,151
But then you got shot.
Now you's a basehead.

341
00:26:24,413 --> 00:26:26,453
You're messed up.
Your life is crap.

342
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:29,621
l know l look like stir-fried shit.

343
00:26:29,877 --> 00:26:32,000
Hook me up with some food.

344
00:26:32,255 --> 00:26:33,880
There's a line. You got to wait.

345
00:26:34,591 --> 00:26:36,251
Give him something to eat.

346
00:26:37,344 --> 00:26:39,301
Hook me up.

347
00:26:39,638 --> 00:26:40,587
This all l get?

348
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,670
You want more?

349
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:44,929
l'm a veteran.

350
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,144
Here. How's that, all right?

351
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:52,350
Clean yourself up,
maybe l'll give you a job.

352
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:53,565
All right, man.

353
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,195
Want to buy a turkey?

354
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:57,031
l'm keeping an eye on him.

355
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:04,991
You don't deserve that turkey.
l hooked you up for that last get-high.

356
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:07,538
Why l got to be owing you?

357
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:11,247
l was prom queen of King High School.

358
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:13,297
This is beneath me.

359
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,838
You used to be prom queen, now you're
the prom fiend. Look at you!

360
00:27:23,102 --> 00:27:24,097
Hey what?!

361
00:27:24,645 --> 00:27:26,887
Didn't l hook you up?

362
00:27:27,148 --> 00:27:31,561
Didn't l get that pipe from the lranian
who tried to beat me out of $5?

363
00:27:32,362 --> 00:27:37,190
Didn't l speak to your mother after
she called me a homeless bastard?

364
00:27:37,993 --> 00:27:39,024
Add all that up...

365
00:27:39,286 --> 00:27:43,414
...and the fact that l can beat
your ass. l say it's my turkey!

366
00:27:43,665 --> 00:27:45,373
Get away!
Get the fuck away!

367
00:27:48,963 --> 00:27:51,834
Stop beating on her!
Stop it!

368
00:27:59,224 --> 00:28:00,884
Let go of me, man.

369
00:28:01,393 --> 00:28:05,972
Beat her up over a turkey.
You're a poor excuse for a brother.

370
00:28:06,231 --> 00:28:10,526
Shit, man! Fuck! Shit!
lt's a cop! lt's a cop!

371
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,359
Shut up!

372
00:28:18,244 --> 00:28:20,533
Shut up or l'll blow your brains out.

373
00:28:21,498 --> 00:28:23,040
Don't hurt me.

374
00:28:23,292 --> 00:28:25,534
-Shut up!
-l know l was wrong to beat that girl.

375
00:28:25,794 --> 00:28:27,419
Crack has got me.

376
00:28:27,922 --> 00:28:31,125
l got no control over it.
l tried to kick...

377
00:28:31,384 --> 00:28:35,547
...but the shit be calling me.
lt calling me. l got to go to it.

378
00:28:36,222 --> 00:28:38,298
-l need help, man.
-Come on, man.

379
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:46,522
-We got a crack monster.
-Your mother's a monster!

380
00:28:47,234 --> 00:28:48,728
-Hold him.
-What you writing?

381
00:28:48,986 --> 00:28:52,438
"Pookie" Benny Robinson. Your name.

382
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:57,567
-l'm trying to help you.
-You ain't helping nobody!

383
00:28:57,829 --> 00:28:59,786
-lt's for your own good.
-Fuck you, man!

384
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,071
They'll hook you up.

385
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:02,364
l'm going to die!

386
00:29:04,628 --> 00:29:07,201
They're going to help you.
They'll help you.

387
00:29:24,983 --> 00:29:27,901
l had pretty much
everything l ever wanted.

388
00:29:28,153 --> 00:29:30,063
Everything l thought l wanted.

389
00:29:30,614 --> 00:29:32,987
l always had a need for acceptance.

390
00:29:33,242 --> 00:29:35,365
All my friends were doing it.

391
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,992
Thought l could quit anytime.

392
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,948
That's when l woke up in the hospital.

393
00:29:42,335 --> 00:29:44,043
lt's a very simple program.

394
00:29:44,296 --> 00:29:47,416
We only ask that you don't use
or drink, one day at a time.

395
00:29:47,674 --> 00:29:50,344
Don't leave before the miracle happens.

396
00:29:52,513 --> 00:29:54,636
This program has revolving doors.

397
00:29:54,891 --> 00:29:58,889
But just because you go out,
don't mean you can come back in.

398
00:30:10,574 --> 00:30:12,567
lt's crazy, because...

399
00:30:13,577 --> 00:30:17,789
...l did everything. l whored.
l ripped my family off.

400
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:21,706
l was so scandalous,
l would even sell my baby's Pampers.

401
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:24,748
l have a crack baby.

402
00:30:25,215 --> 00:30:27,124
He was born blind.

403
00:30:29,219 --> 00:30:32,470
l know why he's blind.
Everybody knows why he's blind.

404
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:37,184
l kept telling myself l was
going to kick, but l never did.

405
00:30:37,728 --> 00:30:39,271
l'm a junkie.

406
00:30:40,189 --> 00:30:42,431
l'll be a junkie the rest of my life.

407
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:09,845
lt's the first time
l've been away for so long...

408
00:31:10,097 --> 00:31:13,513
...and personally, l hope l never see
you motherfuckers again.

409
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:17,513
When l get out, l'll just take
everything one day at a time.

410
00:31:17,813 --> 00:31:19,272
One day at a time.

411
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:30,028
Chill out. You been out two minutes
and already you want a job.

412
00:31:30,327 --> 00:31:33,862
lt's not just a job.
You saved my life.

413
00:31:34,123 --> 00:31:38,452
Let me pay you back.
Let me help you bring Nino down.

414
00:31:38,753 --> 00:31:41,789
He promised me a job.
l'll take his money...

415
00:31:42,048 --> 00:31:43,044
...and report to you.

416
00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:44,544
l don't know.

417
00:31:45,385 --> 00:31:48,552
You know what will happen
if l stay on the streets.

418
00:31:48,805 --> 00:31:53,681
l need to be a part of something.
lf you don't believe in me, who will?

419
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,852
<i>Cool. You been inside,</i>
<i>checked out the operations.</i>

420
00:32:03,905 --> 00:32:07,072
All right, Pookie.
Parks, come help me out.

421
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:09,318
Tell me what goes on in this dump.

422
00:32:09,578 --> 00:32:13,243
lt took me awhile,
but l've been through the whole joint.

423
00:32:13,499 --> 00:32:16,998
First, you got to show
a membership card to this runner.

424
00:32:17,837 --> 00:32:19,248
<i>It's like a video club.</i>

425
00:32:19,547 --> 00:32:22,667
<i>Nino's got it hooked up</i>
<i>like</i> Mission: lmpossible.

426
00:32:23,259 --> 00:32:26,463
<i>Walking through that courtyard's</i>
<i>like a nightmare.</i>

427
00:32:26,721 --> 00:32:28,963
<i>It's a nation full of zombies.</i>

428
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:43,189
<i>On the 2nd floor, a worker</i>
<i>rings a buzzer and a code.</i>

429
00:32:43,489 --> 00:32:46,444
<i>A little panel on the wall opens up,</i>
<i>you get the crack.</i>

430
00:32:46,701 --> 00:32:48,777
<i>The code, the buzzer, where that go?</i>

431
00:32:49,037 --> 00:32:53,865
<i>The call goes to "The Drug Store"</i>
<i>where they make the crack.</i>

432
00:32:54,126 --> 00:32:59,084
<i>I heard they got everybody in there</i>
<i>butt-naked. Titties hanging....</i>

433
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,748
Nino don't trust a motherfucker.

434
00:33:09,434 --> 00:33:10,597
Nino's one sick genius.

435
00:33:10,852 --> 00:33:14,637
A mind is a terrible thing to waste.
What happens at The Drug Store?

436
00:33:14,898 --> 00:33:18,433
You can take your goodies home,
or stay at The Enterprise.

437
00:33:19,028 --> 00:33:20,439
<i>What's The Enterprise?</i>

438
00:33:20,696 --> 00:33:22,855
<i>What am I, your ghetto tour guide?</i>

439
00:33:23,115 --> 00:33:25,903
<i>They got all this equipment</i>
<i>and you don't know shit.</i>

440
00:33:26,202 --> 00:33:30,331
<i>When you're smoking crack, they say</i>
<i>you're "beaming up to Scotty. "</i>

441
00:33:30,582 --> 00:33:32,456
<i>You're going to another world.</i>

442
00:33:32,709 --> 00:33:34,334
<i>Crack is the "final frontier. "</i>

443
00:33:34,586 --> 00:33:37,422
<i>That's why they call that room</i>
<i>"The Enterprise. "</i>

444
00:33:38,507 --> 00:33:42,671
<i>People sit down and light that</i>
<i>glass dick and take a hit.</i>

445
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:48,846
<i>It's scary. Their eyes look like</i>
<i>a rocket, getting ready to blast off.</i>

446
00:33:49,269 --> 00:33:51,308
Nino has most of the apartments?

447
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:55,643
Man, are you deaf, or what?
The boy controls the whole place.

448
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:57,894
Nino Brown's a mad scientist.

449
00:33:58,153 --> 00:34:02,448
Marvin said it. "The boy that made
slaves out of men. " That's Nino!

450
00:34:02,783 --> 00:34:04,326
That's deep.

451
00:34:04,619 --> 00:34:09,744
Six, five, four, three,
two, one... .

452
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:12,623
Happy New Year!

453
00:34:15,172 --> 00:34:19,384
Welcome to the Spotlite
with the Flavor Flav.

454
00:34:19,635 --> 00:34:21,793
Everybody say "Happy...

455
00:34:23,055 --> 00:34:24,763
...New Year! "

456
00:34:25,349 --> 00:34:30,308
This is the fruit of our hard work.
The belief in entrepreneurial spirit.

457
00:34:30,563 --> 00:34:32,640
The new American dream.

458
00:34:33,149 --> 00:34:34,229
A toast.

459
00:34:37,029 --> 00:34:40,149
A toast to my family, in life...

460
00:34:41,033 --> 00:34:42,492
...until death.

461
00:34:42,743 --> 00:34:44,154
Happy New Year.

462
00:34:47,331 --> 00:34:49,408
To CMB. On and on.

463
00:34:50,418 --> 00:34:53,336
-Am l my brother's keeper?
-Yes, l am!

464
00:34:53,588 --> 00:34:55,498
Am l my brother's keeper?

465
00:34:56,508 --> 00:34:58,750
Am l my brother's keeper?

466
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,056
l am!

467
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:17,644
Look at it.

468
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:22,117
A big reason for this success is you.

469
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:24,988
But this ain't about success.

470
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,288
This is about survival.

471
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:32,418
We ain't going out like Puss Head,
shot up over a $10 bag. You know?

472
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,499
You got to be smarter than that.

473
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:36,882
We got to look out for one another.

474
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:40,379
l feel the same way.

475
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:45,093
Nothing and no one
will come between you and me.

476
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:46,634
Never.

477
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:48,011
Right?

478
00:35:48,648 --> 00:35:50,142
l love you.

479
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:52,192
l love you too.

480
00:35:53,862 --> 00:35:55,689
Let's go get busy.

481
00:35:59,868 --> 00:36:01,742
Frank Needles out here.

482
00:36:06,167 --> 00:36:07,329
Let him in.

483
00:36:13,091 --> 00:36:15,629
My ace boon coon!
How you doing?

484
00:36:16,094 --> 00:36:17,968
Happy New Year.
What's a matter...

485
00:36:18,221 --> 00:36:20,843
...too rich to toast the New Year
with an old friend?

486
00:36:21,141 --> 00:36:24,676
lf it isn't the thinking man's Rocky.
How are you doing?

487
00:36:24,937 --> 00:36:26,217
Great. Love the hair.

488
00:36:26,564 --> 00:36:30,893
The Don and l, we was thinking,
let's let bygones be bygones.

489
00:36:31,194 --> 00:36:35,358
We congratulate you on your new success.
To show our good faith...

490
00:36:35,907 --> 00:36:37,152
...a gift from the Don.

491
00:36:41,872 --> 00:36:42,702
Open it.

492
00:36:52,925 --> 00:36:54,965
To the <i>moolanyan</i> in charge.

493
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,844
All the best, babe.

494
00:37:06,941 --> 00:37:10,108
You motherfucking creep!
Think you'll get away with that?

495
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,983
l just did.

496
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,822
Step off, Gigantor!

497
00:37:18,286 --> 00:37:22,949
Now get their silly, spaghetti-eating
asses out of my office.

498
00:37:25,252 --> 00:37:28,456
Frank, come on. Let's go.
Let's get out of here!

499
00:37:46,608 --> 00:37:50,060
<i>It's total slamboyancy</i>
<i>in the Spotlite tonight.</i>

500
00:37:50,321 --> 00:37:54,900
You're about to get rocked by some cool,
mellow fellows from Brooklyn.

501
00:37:55,159 --> 00:38:00,035
l'm talking about Aaron, Damien,
Teddy, Slim, Guy.

502
00:38:00,498 --> 00:38:01,779
Give it up.

503
00:38:08,883 --> 00:38:11,006
Slim, give a little bit of bass.

504
00:38:19,853 --> 00:38:23,898
<i>This is the sound</i>
<i>That get harder and get down</i>

505
00:38:24,858 --> 00:38:27,065
<i>Everyone must know</i>

506
00:38:28,737 --> 00:38:33,032
<i>We've been here before</i>
<i>And we're going to give you more</i>

507
00:38:34,076 --> 00:38:36,318
<i>It's time to let it show</i>

508
00:38:37,664 --> 00:38:39,122
<i>Music is funky</i>

509
00:38:39,707 --> 00:38:42,199
<i>Girls are so fly</i>

510
00:38:43,879 --> 00:38:46,037
<i>So sweet and fine</i>

511
00:39:20,043 --> 00:39:22,795
Gee Money, come here,
come here, come here.

512
00:39:24,089 --> 00:39:26,497
That the skeezer you met
at Frankie's?

513
00:39:26,758 --> 00:39:28,418
Yeah, Uniqua.

514
00:39:29,094 --> 00:39:32,345
What's up?
You fucking her correctly or what?

515
00:39:32,765 --> 00:39:36,679
Once, but l just met her.
l need time to get to know her.

516
00:39:38,062 --> 00:39:39,438
l heard that.

517
00:39:41,399 --> 00:39:43,107
Lord, have mercy.

518
00:39:49,283 --> 00:39:51,359
<i>You want to play rough?</i>

519
00:39:52,286 --> 00:39:54,362
<i>Say hello to my little friend.</i>

520
00:40:04,299 --> 00:40:06,042
The world is mine.

521
00:40:06,301 --> 00:40:08,839
And the brothers too, now.
Don't forget us.

522
00:40:09,096 --> 00:40:11,587
The world is yours, Nino.

523
00:40:11,849 --> 00:40:16,345
Only you won't be as careless
as Tony Montana, now will you?

524
00:40:16,604 --> 00:40:18,347
You absolutely right.

525
00:40:18,606 --> 00:40:20,480
l like this girl of yours.

526
00:40:20,775 --> 00:40:23,183
He ain't got no papers,
or a leash on me.

527
00:40:23,445 --> 00:40:26,778
You know what happens
when dogs don't have a leash?

528
00:40:27,115 --> 00:40:29,867
They run the streets
and fuck everything in sight.

529
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:38,117
lt's true. l ain't got no papers
or no leash on her.

530
00:40:38,377 --> 00:40:40,038
But nothing comes between us.

531
00:40:40,338 --> 00:40:42,378
The world is mine!

532
00:40:42,632 --> 00:40:44,340
All mine!

533
00:40:45,218 --> 00:40:47,127
What the fuck are you doing up there?

534
00:40:47,804 --> 00:40:50,556
A man like you, Nino,
needs to leave a legacy.

535
00:40:50,807 --> 00:40:54,722
A son. A mark to let the world know
that he was here.

536
00:40:59,025 --> 00:41:00,602
You know, you absolutely right.

537
00:41:00,902 --> 00:41:03,938
Shit. lt ain't like l ain't
been trying. Ain't that right?

538
00:41:06,908 --> 00:41:08,023
She can't have kids.

539
00:41:09,077 --> 00:41:10,619
She can't fuck, either.

540
00:41:10,913 --> 00:41:13,119
Maybe that's why
she can't have kids.

541
00:41:13,374 --> 00:41:16,043
That ain't right, man.
That ain't right.

542
00:41:17,169 --> 00:41:19,542
-She can't?
-She can't.

543
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:21,920
Too bad.

544
00:41:22,175 --> 00:41:24,381
You're goddamn right that's too bad.

545
00:41:41,571 --> 00:41:44,192
Nino, you need to go get your girl.

546
00:41:47,744 --> 00:41:49,867
You're right. l tell you what.

547
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:57,544
lf l was you, l'd be looking
for the pimples on her booty.

548
00:42:00,299 --> 00:42:02,506
Why the fuck did you have
to say that shit?

549
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,430
l told you before she couldn't
make no babies!

550
00:42:08,934 --> 00:42:10,428
l love you!

551
00:42:10,977 --> 00:42:14,014
And now you're taking me for granted.
How can you do that?

552
00:42:14,273 --> 00:42:16,728
This is corny!
This is soap opera shit!

553
00:42:16,984 --> 00:42:18,893
-You act like l owe you something.
-You do.

554
00:42:19,153 --> 00:42:20,896
l don't owe you jack!

555
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,780
Okay, you did give me
a couple of books to read.

556
00:42:25,076 --> 00:42:29,121
And you helped build the brothers.
But l was your ticket out of boredom.

557
00:42:29,497 --> 00:42:33,578
When your rich doctor daddy was
making house calls at Harlem General.

558
00:42:33,835 --> 00:42:35,828
What's up with that? Right?

559
00:42:36,088 --> 00:42:40,964
When your kleptomaniac mother
was housing shit in Bloomingdales.

560
00:42:41,302 --> 00:42:43,211
Don't throw shit in my face--

561
00:42:43,471 --> 00:42:45,879
You ever touch me again,
l'll--

562
00:43:17,174 --> 00:43:19,463
Yeah, l'm aware of that situation.

563
00:43:19,718 --> 00:43:21,592
<i>Your man hired an ex-dealer.</i>

564
00:43:21,846 --> 00:43:26,259
l know it seems unconventional.
Appleton and Peretti report to me.

565
00:43:26,517 --> 00:43:28,344
<i>-Is it out of control?</i>
-No.

566
00:43:28,645 --> 00:43:29,973
<i>Don't blow this.</i>

567
00:43:30,313 --> 00:43:33,184
-Does the commissioner know about it?
<i>-Not yet.</i>

568
00:43:33,442 --> 00:43:34,390
Good.

569
00:43:40,866 --> 00:43:43,192
l told you about
that new jack cop shit.

570
00:43:43,536 --> 00:43:48,032
l give you a chance, and you hire
a crackhead. What's with you?

571
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:50,491
Why don't you get off my dick?

572
00:43:50,752 --> 00:43:54,370
When you're ready to put yourself
on the frontline, let me know.

573
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,457
Excuse me. ls this a black thing?

574
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:00,838
lt is, so keep your
toy Mafia-butt out of it!

575
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:04,840
Fuck the Mafia! l'll wax
your high-yellow, narrow-ass butt!

576
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:07,473
Cool it!

577
00:44:07,729 --> 00:44:09,223
Relax, all right?

578
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:12,648
lf you won't handle this,
send the white boy...

579
00:44:12,943 --> 00:44:15,149
...inside The Carter with
the National Guard.

580
00:44:18,365 --> 00:44:21,283
What we need is a videotape
of this whole operation.

581
00:44:21,535 --> 00:44:24,655
We need evidence of the
financial records to make it work.

582
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,710
l'm the lookout there from
7 p.m. to 7 a.m... .

583
00:44:29,002 --> 00:44:31,208
...in one of the apartment windows.

584
00:44:31,463 --> 00:44:34,583
l had to fill out an application.
Asked if l still got high.

585
00:44:34,841 --> 00:44:36,585
They remember me from before.

586
00:44:36,843 --> 00:44:40,711
l was one of their first customers.
l used to get fucked up.

587
00:44:40,973 --> 00:44:42,432
Cracker barrel, cracker ass.

588
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:45,720
l got it, l got it.

589
00:44:54,905 --> 00:44:56,862
This belt is really a video camera.

590
00:44:57,449 --> 00:45:00,569
These wire transmitters will be
taped to you.

591
00:45:00,828 --> 00:45:03,153
lt'll send your
communication to us...

592
00:45:03,414 --> 00:45:05,537
...as well as sounds and images
around you.

593
00:45:05,791 --> 00:45:08,117
lt will also pick up
shit you can't even hear.

594
00:45:09,128 --> 00:45:11,750
You'll be great.
You're the best man for this job.

595
00:45:12,048 --> 00:45:13,459
You're a fucking genius.

596
00:45:13,758 --> 00:45:14,873
Your mother.

597
00:45:15,927 --> 00:45:17,635
Pookie, we're counting on you.

598
00:45:18,347 --> 00:45:20,838
You can help us bring down CMB.

599
00:45:22,518 --> 00:45:23,467
Try this on.

600
00:45:25,146 --> 00:45:26,308
You with it?

601
00:45:26,731 --> 00:45:27,810
l'm with it, man.

602
00:45:29,317 --> 00:45:30,941
Let's roll with it.

603
00:45:31,194 --> 00:45:32,308
Put it on.

604
00:45:51,257 --> 00:45:53,879
<i>Pookie, come here, man.</i>
<i>Come here.</i>

608
00:46:03,687 --> 00:46:06,724
<i>Anything that makes them</i>
<i>more money, they like.</i>

609
00:46:06,982 --> 00:46:08,145
This might be it.

610
00:46:08,401 --> 00:46:09,943
<i>We're promoting you.</i>

611
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:11,564
Check it out.

<i>Soon. Let's get going with it.</i>

613
00:46:16,993 --> 00:46:18,274
Jackpot! System!

614
00:46:18,537 --> 00:46:20,364
He's inside! Yes!

615
00:46:21,081 --> 00:46:23,489
This kid's been
bringing us business.

616
00:46:23,834 --> 00:46:26,752
<i>I'd like to take a shot</i>
<i>at one of those computer terminals.</i>

00:46:27,004 --> 00:46:30,420
<i>-Can you program Pascal?</i>
<i>-Can a white man dance?</i>

618
00:46:30,758 --> 00:46:33,380
<i>I guess not.</i>
<i>But people lose interest.</i>

619
00:46:33,636 --> 00:46:36,887
<i>Today's your lucky day, homeboy.</i>
<i>I'm promoting your ass.</i>

620
00:46:38,642 --> 00:46:39,970
<i>You still on the pipe?</i>

621
00:46:40,227 --> 00:46:41,472
<i>No way.</i>

622
00:46:41,728 --> 00:46:42,760
<i>Good. Real good.</i>

623
00:46:43,021 --> 00:46:45,310
<i>Because you'll be working</i>
<i>in The Drug Store.</i>

624
00:46:45,566 --> 00:46:47,724
l'm glad you got confidence in me.

625
00:46:48,068 --> 00:46:49,397
See you.

626
00:46:52,281 --> 00:46:54,654
-Keep an eye on that kid.
-Why? What's wrong?

627
00:46:54,909 --> 00:46:57,447
He's light-fingered.
Keep an eye on the product.

628
00:47:00,373 --> 00:47:03,873
l don't think Pookie's ready
to be in a room full of crack.

629
00:47:04,127 --> 00:47:07,413
l'm ready. Don't l look ready now?
l was born ready.

630
00:47:07,715 --> 00:47:10,420
-Ready to be dead.
-Stay out of this.

631
00:47:13,888 --> 00:47:16,426
He's already on the inside.
With a little more time...

632
00:47:16,683 --> 00:47:20,052
...we'll have enough information
to put Nino away for good.

633
00:47:20,312 --> 00:47:21,854
ln my opinion, we get him out--

634
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:24,015
l don't want your opinion.

635
00:47:26,151 --> 00:47:27,432
l'm against it.

636
00:47:28,153 --> 00:47:30,609
-But it's your call.
-And your funeral.

637
00:47:38,748 --> 00:47:40,741
We told them, man.

638
00:47:41,751 --> 00:47:43,495
Ready? Shit.

639
00:47:44,296 --> 00:47:48,045
You better be ready,
because you owe a lot of people.

640
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,838
You owe me. You owe yourself.

641
00:47:51,262 --> 00:47:53,338
You owe the whole community.

642
00:47:53,598 --> 00:47:56,634
You even owe my mother.
Yeah, that's right.

643
00:47:56,935 --> 00:47:59,556
A junkie just like you
killed my mother in 1974.

644
00:47:59,813 --> 00:48:02,565
Didn't take money or jewelry.

645
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:05,477
Just took her life.

646
00:48:05,777 --> 00:48:09,906
l don't know what you got left
in your so-called rehabilitated body.

647
00:48:10,157 --> 00:48:13,740
But you better find something,
because you owe a lot of people.

648
00:48:13,995 --> 00:48:16,616
A lot of people. You owe, Pook.

649
00:49:35,249 --> 00:49:37,041
You got skim milk
in them titties?

650
00:49:40,588 --> 00:49:43,506
One and a-two and a-three
and a-four... .

651
00:49:43,758 --> 00:49:46,249
<i>I'll give you something</i>
<i>to look at.</i>

652
00:49:47,053 --> 00:49:51,004
Superfly, there's something wrong
with your boy.

653
00:49:51,892 --> 00:49:53,766
What's happening with Pookie?

654
00:49:55,563 --> 00:49:56,677
l have no idea.

655
00:49:56,939 --> 00:49:58,813
You should, he's your plant.

656
00:49:59,066 --> 00:50:01,736
Cool out. You're jumping the gun.

657
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:04,069
Something's wrong with your guy.

658
00:50:04,322 --> 00:50:06,196
<i>Fourscore seven years.</i>

659
00:50:06,449 --> 00:50:09,237
-ls that code for help?
-lt's a black thing.

660
00:50:09,494 --> 00:50:12,365
l'm tired of your stuff.
l'm tired of this dude.

661
00:50:12,623 --> 00:50:13,654
<i>What's wrong?</i>

662
00:50:13,916 --> 00:50:18,625
<i>Just doing a workout. This is</i>
<i>a tough job. Got to stay in shape.</i>

663
00:50:19,589 --> 00:50:21,712
A workout boosts worker morale.

664
00:50:22,133 --> 00:50:23,248
You think l'm stupid.

665
00:50:23,843 --> 00:50:25,587
You're a high motherfucker.

666
00:50:28,306 --> 00:50:29,136
<i>You five-o?</i>

667
00:50:29,391 --> 00:50:31,431
-His cover's blown!
-Let's go!

668
00:50:32,644 --> 00:50:34,352
Are you five-o?!

669
00:50:35,814 --> 00:50:38,981
<i>Take him out and kill him!</i>
<i>And blow the building!</i>

670
00:50:39,527 --> 00:50:41,235
<i>Scotty help me! I'm going to die!</i>

671
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:42,484
Let's go!

672
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:04,800
Let's go!

673
00:51:32,417 --> 00:51:34,077
Let me through!
l'll do her!

674
00:51:51,354 --> 00:51:52,350
Clear!

675
00:52:07,247 --> 00:52:08,789
Police! Get out!

676
00:52:09,249 --> 00:52:10,079
Come on!

677
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:22,049
Shit!

678
00:52:23,764 --> 00:52:25,093
Shit! Nothing here!

679
00:52:25,349 --> 00:52:26,974
Let's get out of here!

680
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,691
Come here. Hold on.
Keep your head down.

681
00:52:41,162 --> 00:52:42,111
Here we go!

682
00:52:53,007 --> 00:52:54,418
Scotty!

683
00:52:55,176 --> 00:52:56,753
Where the hell are you?

684
00:53:02,767 --> 00:53:05,721
-Shit!
-Touch Pookie, it blows.

685
00:53:05,978 --> 00:53:07,722
-Do this.
-There's too many wires.

686
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:09,143
Pick one.

687
00:53:09,815 --> 00:53:11,060
Come on!

688
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:13,517
l can't see.
Give me a light!

689
00:53:13,986 --> 00:53:14,982
Hold it there.

690
00:53:15,238 --> 00:53:16,648
Scotty, on three...

691
00:53:16,948 --> 00:53:20,233
...l want you to slowly,
gently pull out the blue wire.

692
00:53:21,118 --> 00:53:22,198
Slow!

693
00:53:24,288 --> 00:53:25,118
One...

694
00:53:25,665 --> 00:53:26,779
...two...

695
00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:28,031
...three!

696
00:53:32,797 --> 00:53:34,754
-One is the ground.
-Which?

697
00:53:35,049 --> 00:53:36,674
-l don't know!
-Three seconds left!

698
00:54:24,974 --> 00:54:28,557
l knew it! You ain't nothing
but a high-priced whore.

699
00:54:29,103 --> 00:54:30,977
<i>Put Nino on, bitch.</i>

700
00:54:31,564 --> 00:54:33,106
lt's for you.

701
00:54:38,154 --> 00:54:39,565
What's up?

702
00:54:39,822 --> 00:54:43,108
<i>I know you're having a good time,</i>
<i>but we were infiltrated.</i>

703
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:46,578
We shut down The Carter.

704
00:54:47,788 --> 00:54:49,283
Get your ass here now!

705
00:54:49,957 --> 00:54:51,155
<i>Now!</i>

706
00:54:57,256 --> 00:54:58,335
Stop!

707
00:55:11,646 --> 00:55:12,974
What happened?

708
00:55:16,651 --> 00:55:20,814
Don't nobody know nothing?
Don't everybody speak at once.

709
00:55:22,198 --> 00:55:24,155
How the motherfucker get in?

710
00:55:26,827 --> 00:55:30,825
Out of all you motherfuckers,
nobody knows jack shit?

711
00:55:35,002 --> 00:55:37,873
The Duh Duh Man.
Duh Duh, what happened?

712
00:55:43,970 --> 00:55:45,796
l'll be a motherfucker.

713
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:48,338
Don't nobody know nothing?

714
00:55:49,475 --> 00:55:50,803
What up with this?

715
00:55:52,561 --> 00:55:55,313
Somebody got to know something
was going on.

716
00:55:55,564 --> 00:55:56,845
See what l'm saying?

717
00:55:57,525 --> 00:55:59,019
Ain't that right, Gee Money?

718
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:02,482
l think Gee Money definitely
knows something.

719
00:56:03,155 --> 00:56:04,650
Gee Money knows something.

720
00:56:07,326 --> 00:56:10,660
You fucked up.
You fucked up bigtime.

721
00:56:11,038 --> 00:56:13,364
You're incapable of running this shit.

722
00:56:13,833 --> 00:56:16,750
Sit your five-dollar ass down,
before l make change.

723
00:56:18,421 --> 00:56:20,579
Kareem brought him to my attention.

724
00:56:21,173 --> 00:56:22,751
We got 300 employees.

725
00:56:23,009 --> 00:56:26,212
l can't keep my eye on all of them.

726
00:56:28,055 --> 00:56:29,715
lf you was taking care
of business--

727
00:56:30,057 --> 00:56:33,011
What? lf l was what?
Say it again!

728
00:56:33,269 --> 00:56:34,051
What?!

729
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:36,810
Nothing.

730
00:56:37,064 --> 00:56:40,729
That's what l thought you said!
Because that's what l got, nothing!

731
00:56:40,943 --> 00:56:44,193
A million-dollar-a-week business
reduced to rubbish!

732
00:56:49,744 --> 00:56:50,989
lt's your responsibility.

733
00:57:00,087 --> 00:57:03,290
l never liked you anyway,
pretty motherfucker.

734
00:57:14,935 --> 00:57:18,554
What's the matter, Gee?
What's up with you?

735
00:57:19,273 --> 00:57:24,019
You're letting some shit like who
l'm laying the pipe to, fuck with you?

736
00:57:24,278 --> 00:57:25,938
You're bigger than that.

737
00:57:27,907 --> 00:57:31,572
Something like this
can never happen again.

738
00:57:55,142 --> 00:57:56,340
Now...

739
00:57:59,105 --> 00:58:00,515
...leave me.

740
00:58:02,692 --> 00:58:04,649
Get the fuck out.

741
00:58:34,181 --> 00:58:36,470
What Gee Money has brought together...

742
00:58:37,018 --> 00:58:39,010
...let no man put asunder.

743
00:58:40,062 --> 00:58:42,221
l now pronounce us man...

744
00:58:42,565 --> 00:58:43,845
...and wife.

745
00:58:46,152 --> 00:58:47,694
You may kiss the bride.

746
00:58:54,326 --> 00:58:58,656
Be not deceived.
Neither fornicators, nor idolaters...

747
00:58:58,914 --> 00:59:02,533
...nor adulterers, nor abusers
of themselves with mankind...

748
00:59:02,793 --> 00:59:05,249
...shall inherit the kingdom of God.

749
00:59:05,838 --> 00:59:08,246
May your soul rest in peace.

750
00:59:08,716 --> 00:59:10,044
Goodbye, Pookie.

751
00:59:20,853 --> 00:59:23,225
The commissioner's been on my ass.

752
00:59:23,564 --> 00:59:28,392
Washington is blaming us for losing
thousands of dollars in man-hours.

753
00:59:29,236 --> 00:59:31,443
Not to mention all the cops
we got killed.

754
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:34,779
The operation was a failure.

755
00:59:35,701 --> 00:59:37,908
We didn't arrest anyone.
No one, man.

756
00:59:38,788 --> 00:59:42,832
We didn't get any evidence. Nothing.
No financial records, nothing.

757
00:59:43,959 --> 00:59:47,245
We still could be out there
fighting scum like Nino Brown...

758
00:59:47,546 --> 00:59:49,290
...except for two things:

759
00:59:52,885 --> 00:59:56,930
l gambled on you,
and you gambled on a crackhead.

760
00:59:57,473 --> 00:59:58,504
Fuck that!

761
00:59:58,808 --> 00:59:59,839
That's enough, man!

762
01:00:01,894 --> 01:00:05,974
l'm sorry you lost your budget.
But l lost a friend.

763
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:10,726
Let it go.

764
01:00:11,404 --> 01:00:12,981
Operation's over.

765
01:00:17,618 --> 01:00:18,781
lt's over.

766
01:00:21,956 --> 01:00:25,491
lt ain't over.
Pookie didn't die for nothing.

767
01:00:28,921 --> 01:00:30,415
<i>Operation's gone...</i>

768
01:00:30,923 --> 01:00:33,592
...Nino's loose, Pookie is dead.

769
01:00:33,843 --> 01:00:35,716
l got Pookie killed.

770
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:39,553
Cut out this self-pitying shit
about you killing Pookie.

771
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:42,642
lf anyone killed him, it was me.
l could see it.

772
01:00:42,977 --> 01:00:45,812
How you going to tell me
you killed Pookie?

773
01:00:48,816 --> 01:00:51,141
Remember when you said
l didn't care?

774
01:00:53,612 --> 01:00:57,313
When what the hell was l doing
at Pookie's funeral anyway? Remember?

775
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:01,827
l used to be Pookie.

776
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:04,653
How the hell you used to be Pookie?

777
01:01:04,915 --> 01:01:07,157
l was a poor white trash Pookie.

778
01:01:07,626 --> 01:01:11,576
This whole drug shit, it's not
a black thing, it's not a white thing.

779
01:01:12,548 --> 01:01:15,668
lt's a death thing.
Death doesn't give a shit about color.

780
01:01:17,803 --> 01:01:19,179
You don't have to like me.

781
01:01:19,889 --> 01:01:22,012
l don't even know if l like you.

782
01:01:25,478 --> 01:01:27,470
But we're in this together now.

783
01:01:27,855 --> 01:01:32,647
You know, a drug dealer
is the worst kind of brother.

784
01:01:33,652 --> 01:01:36,938
He won't sell it to his sister
or his mother.

785
01:01:37,156 --> 01:01:39,564
But he'll sell it
to his boys in the street.

786
01:01:40,910 --> 01:01:42,570
l don't know about you...

787
01:01:44,038 --> 01:01:46,244
...but l'm ready to kill Nino Brown.

788
01:01:47,208 --> 01:01:48,702
Are you with me?

789
01:01:50,503 --> 01:01:52,045
l'm ahead of you.

790
01:02:06,185 --> 01:02:09,601
Behind door number one,
your head explodes like a melon.

791
01:02:09,814 --> 01:02:14,226
Behind two, you hook us up with
Gee Money and get the prize, Nino Brown.

792
01:02:15,694 --> 01:02:17,354
Let's make a deal.

793
01:02:20,157 --> 01:02:24,903
You and me always had an understanding.
Besides, l needed a haircut.

794
01:02:29,208 --> 01:02:31,616
My <i>cugino</i> and his friend
are hungry.

795
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:35,790
And l got a feeling
they'll cut you a sweeter deal...

796
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:37,714
...than any Peruvian.

797
01:02:38,008 --> 01:02:40,546
Enough to maybe throw in
a finder's fee for me.

798
01:02:44,723 --> 01:02:46,182
lf l swim with this--

799
01:02:46,434 --> 01:02:51,012
You wanted to meet the main man.
From now on, you deal with me...

800
01:02:51,272 --> 01:02:52,647
...and me only.

801
01:03:08,330 --> 01:03:10,370
You will cut me a side deal.

802
01:03:10,791 --> 01:03:12,120
Twenty percent.

803
01:03:12,918 --> 01:03:15,326
And you will be obligated
to report to me...

804
01:03:15,754 --> 01:03:17,130
...and me only.

805
01:03:19,175 --> 01:03:20,088
Give me your number.

806
01:03:46,911 --> 01:03:48,109
Don Armeteo.

807
01:03:49,038 --> 01:03:50,995
Nino is about to itch.

808
01:03:54,043 --> 01:03:57,791
-What the fuck is up?
-What's up? Play ball, that's what.

809
01:03:58,798 --> 01:03:59,793
Check!

810
01:04:07,973 --> 01:04:09,088
Can l help you?

811
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:10,844
l'm here to see Gee Money.

812
01:04:11,685 --> 01:04:13,643
-What's up with these elbows?
-Sucker!

813
01:04:13,979 --> 01:04:15,260
l don't know you.

814
01:04:16,357 --> 01:04:17,436
You know him?

815
01:04:17,691 --> 01:04:20,396
Hold up. l know him. He's cool.

816
01:04:21,403 --> 01:04:23,729
Ease back, playboy. Ease back.

817
01:04:24,532 --> 01:04:27,402
How you feeling, Gee Money, my man?

818
01:04:29,829 --> 01:04:31,702
What's up with your man?

819
01:04:33,874 --> 01:04:35,037
Pat him down.

820
01:04:36,001 --> 01:04:37,164
Pat him down!

821
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:40,922
lt's like that?

822
01:04:42,842 --> 01:04:44,300
What the fuck is this?

823
01:04:44,552 --> 01:04:46,710
l don't know you, that's what.

824
01:04:47,513 --> 01:04:51,463
l know you're my man's new contact,
but l don't trust you.

825
01:04:51,725 --> 01:04:54,561
So since you're interrupting my game,
get the fuck out.

826
01:05:00,401 --> 01:05:01,231
Mr. Money...

827
01:05:01,569 --> 01:05:05,020
...please escort Mr. Washington
off the court. Take him down the block.

828
01:05:05,281 --> 01:05:08,116
And if this dreadlocked
<i>bomboraas</i> even blinks wrong...

829
01:05:08,409 --> 01:05:10,200
...you lullaby his ass.

830
01:05:15,833 --> 01:05:18,953
Don't forget what we talked about
before at Frankie's.

831
01:05:19,211 --> 01:05:21,453
l'm definitely going to be
the next king.

832
01:05:22,756 --> 01:05:25,378
Yo, Keish, l seen that boy
somewhere before.

833
01:05:30,723 --> 01:05:35,135
That's right, l checked him out myself.
He cooler than a fan.

834
01:05:35,561 --> 01:05:39,559
And the product is 60% cheaper
than what the brothers is paying.

835
01:05:40,274 --> 01:05:43,358
<i>That will free up</i>
<i>a whole lot of money...</i>

836
01:05:43,611 --> 01:05:45,603
<i>... to do a lot of other things.</i>

837
01:05:46,238 --> 01:05:48,445
Like, maybe take over
another city project?

838
01:05:49,158 --> 01:05:51,150
<i>All right, let's roll with it.</i>

839
01:05:51,410 --> 01:05:53,568
<i>Rebuild and get stronger.</i>

840
01:05:53,829 --> 01:05:55,905
Most definite. Most definite.

841
01:05:56,165 --> 01:05:57,873
<i>Money, I'll tell you something.</i>

842
01:05:58,334 --> 01:06:00,326
lf he's not who he says he is...

843
01:06:00,628 --> 01:06:02,170
...l'll kill him.

844
01:06:03,297 --> 01:06:04,625
Then l'll kill you.

845
01:06:08,969 --> 01:06:10,796
<i>I don't trust Mr. Washington.</i>

846
01:06:11,013 --> 01:06:14,180
<i>I want him to stick to me</i>
<i>like flies to shit.</i>

847
01:06:17,728 --> 01:06:21,097
When l was young, l was a member
of a gang, the L.A. Boys.

848
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,563
-Lennox Ave.
-You know it.

849
01:06:23,817 --> 01:06:27,021
The leader, Jughead,
told me to prove my loyalty...

850
01:06:27,279 --> 01:06:29,687
...l had to snuff somebody out.

851
01:06:29,949 --> 01:06:31,609
lt was like, "No problem. "

852
01:06:31,867 --> 01:06:35,450
l said, "An enemy?"
He said, "No, that's too easy.

853
01:06:35,704 --> 01:06:38,030
lt's got to be an ordinary mo. "

854
01:06:38,666 --> 01:06:40,326
So l rode down to 23rd.

855
01:06:40,626 --> 01:06:43,995
Copped me a bag of that
red devil angel dust.

856
01:06:48,968 --> 01:06:50,841
l got so zooted.

857
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:56,594
l walked up on this lady.
She must have been a schoolteacher.

858
01:06:56,976 --> 01:06:59,977
l was so fucking crazy,
l didn't even care.

859
01:07:01,355 --> 01:07:03,015
l stepped to her.

860
01:07:08,696 --> 01:07:10,819
l didn't even stay
to see her drop.

861
01:07:11,490 --> 01:07:12,984
l just ran.

862
01:07:15,703 --> 01:07:17,411
You must think l'm a demon.

863
01:07:19,999 --> 01:07:21,991
l guess what you was doing...

864
01:07:23,168 --> 01:07:25,706
...it was like business, right?

865
01:07:26,922 --> 01:07:28,085
lt wasn't personal.

866
01:07:29,091 --> 01:07:30,206
My brother...

867
01:07:31,385 --> 01:07:33,093
...it's always business.

868
01:07:33,929 --> 01:07:35,210
Never personal.

869
01:07:38,434 --> 01:07:41,719
-Tell your moms l want some bean pies.
-Can l get some?

870
01:07:42,021 --> 01:07:43,930
Come on in, little man.

871
01:07:45,357 --> 01:07:46,389
Two for you.

872
01:07:47,943 --> 01:07:49,402
Two for you.

873
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:55,945
Two for you.

874
01:07:58,704 --> 01:08:00,993
-Hold up, Pop.
-Get out of here now.

875
01:08:06,045 --> 01:08:07,836
l can take care of you too.

876
01:08:08,088 --> 01:08:11,540
Take care of yourself,
because you an ignorant bastard.

877
01:08:11,926 --> 01:08:15,758
You committing genocide on your people
with your fancy suits and cars.

878
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:17,211
Step off, grandpa.

879
01:08:19,391 --> 01:08:20,305
ldol worshiper!

880
01:08:20,601 --> 01:08:24,017
Killing your people with the
white devils you put in that bottle.

881
01:08:24,271 --> 01:08:26,063
You an idolater.

882
01:08:26,315 --> 01:08:28,391
Reverend Oates,
why are you with this scum?

883
01:08:28,651 --> 01:08:29,433
Shut up!

884
01:08:29,735 --> 01:08:32,308
Nino, let me smoke this old dude.

885
01:08:39,703 --> 01:08:43,783
Look at you. ln two years,
they'll be marking your gravesite.

886
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:45,656
Me?

887
01:08:46,377 --> 01:08:47,919
l'll be right here.

888
01:08:49,755 --> 01:08:51,130
Kids, get out of here!

889
01:08:56,512 --> 01:08:57,792
These kids... .

890
01:08:59,306 --> 01:09:02,971
All these people gather around you
like you God almighty.

891
01:09:03,477 --> 01:09:04,936
Like you love them.

892
01:09:05,271 --> 01:09:08,271
Devils ain't got no love.
You're killing your people.

893
01:09:08,649 --> 01:09:12,314
What can you offer them?
Another l-have-a-dream speech?

894
01:09:12,611 --> 01:09:15,363
Some of that same shit
you ripping off to me?

895
01:09:15,864 --> 01:09:19,483
Look at us. Not a pot to piss in,
nor a window to throw it out of.

896
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:21,239
You's the fool, old man.

897
01:09:25,541 --> 01:09:27,996
Don't try it.
Don't even think about it!

898
01:09:33,257 --> 01:09:34,799
You don't understand.

899
01:09:37,219 --> 01:09:40,006
ldolater, you reap what you sow!

900
01:09:58,365 --> 01:10:00,157
This is some fly shit.

901
01:10:00,492 --> 01:10:04,241
Some George Raft,
some James Cagney-type shit.

902
01:10:04,496 --> 01:10:05,777
You know what l'm saying?

903
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:08,578
-That's how you living.
-Living large!

904
01:10:15,049 --> 01:10:17,836
Good looking out this afternoon.

905
01:10:18,177 --> 01:10:20,383
Gee Money should've seen it coming.

906
01:10:22,932 --> 01:10:25,339
Old man really wanted to do me.

907
01:10:27,686 --> 01:10:28,718
Old bastard.

908
01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:32,852
But here's something
that's not so funny.

909
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:36,187
Gee Money tried to cut
a side deal with me.

910
01:10:42,076 --> 01:10:44,531
You can't trust anybody these days.

911
01:10:45,412 --> 01:10:48,413
You can trust me.
l got your back.

912
01:10:52,711 --> 01:10:53,707
Thank you.

913
01:10:54,421 --> 01:10:58,040
Now Reverend Oates will say
a few words to the happy couple.

914
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:08,091
You got to wait till somebody else
gets some too, okay?

915
01:11:11,730 --> 01:11:14,731
Before we eat this cake,
we ought to toast...

916
01:11:15,317 --> 01:11:18,769
...my daughter, my new son-in-law
and our gracious host...

917
01:11:19,071 --> 01:11:20,482
...Mr. Nino Brown.

918
01:11:38,173 --> 01:11:39,205
Shit!

919
01:11:40,718 --> 01:11:42,093
Fuck!

920
01:11:47,308 --> 01:11:48,138
Good dog.

921
01:11:55,733 --> 01:11:57,191
Oh, baby.

922
01:11:57,735 --> 01:11:58,814
Come on.

923
01:12:44,198 --> 01:12:45,906
l got something for you.

924
01:12:46,909 --> 01:12:49,234
That's my business card.
Call me sometime.

925
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,658
What's up?
You still mad at me?

926
01:13:33,956 --> 01:13:35,284
Fuck you, then.

927
01:13:36,125 --> 01:13:39,957
-Where is the Duh Duh Man?
-Probably after that skeezer.

928
01:13:40,587 --> 01:13:41,916
What's with Selina?

929
01:13:42,172 --> 01:13:44,545
l don't know. Losing her mind.

930
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,373
Think l care?
This is my world, my money...

931
01:13:47,636 --> 01:13:49,296
...and that's my skeezer.

932
01:13:50,097 --> 01:13:52,422
You'll get it all over your dress.

933
01:13:54,810 --> 01:13:55,973
Hi, Daddy.

934
01:14:03,152 --> 01:14:04,943
Hold up a minute.

935
01:14:07,156 --> 01:14:08,650
Thank you, mister.

936
01:14:17,166 --> 01:14:18,161
Cover me!

937
01:14:38,187 --> 01:14:39,182
Throw me a gun!

938
01:14:40,606 --> 01:14:41,768
Get down!

939
01:14:54,370 --> 01:14:55,615
Motherfuckers!

940
01:15:34,368 --> 01:15:36,526
You're a murderer, Nino!

941
01:15:37,329 --> 01:15:40,247
l've seen you kill too many people!

942
01:15:42,710 --> 01:15:44,252
Cancel that bitch.

943
01:15:44,670 --> 01:15:46,247
l'll buy another one.

944
01:15:49,425 --> 01:15:50,835
l hate you!

945
01:15:51,468 --> 01:15:53,377
l hate you, Nino!

946
01:15:56,390 --> 01:15:59,011
Don Armeteo's on the phone for you.

947
01:16:01,729 --> 01:16:04,646
We made you. We gave you everything.

948
01:16:04,898 --> 01:16:09,228
Shagazzy's, the Spotlite,
the street corners.

949
01:16:10,904 --> 01:16:14,190
So you got cute.
You had to get spanked.

950
01:16:14,450 --> 01:16:17,023
Now you listen to me.
l made this. Me.

951
01:16:17,369 --> 01:16:19,943
l own this city, you slicked-back,
greasy-haired...

952
01:16:20,247 --> 01:16:21,160
<i>...son of a bitch!</i>

953
01:16:21,457 --> 01:16:22,915
You're fucked!

954
01:17:02,623 --> 01:17:04,117
<i>This bulletin just in.</i>

955
01:17:04,458 --> 01:17:07,993
<i>In a scene to rival the famed</i>
<i>St. Valentine's Day Massacre...</i>

956
01:17:08,253 --> 01:17:09,961
<i>...of 1920s Chicago...</i>

957
01:17:10,255 --> 01:17:14,383
<i>...Don Armeteo, reputed crime lord,</i>
<i>and ten of his henchmen...</i>

958
01:17:14,635 --> 01:17:16,923
<i>... were gunned down this afternoon....</i>

959
01:17:17,179 --> 01:17:20,050
<i>I put you two together.</i>
<i>You guys go off on your own.</i>

960
01:17:20,265 --> 01:17:21,760
Now you come back to me?

961
01:17:22,017 --> 01:17:24,389
You're telling me
the disk isn't important?

962
01:17:24,645 --> 01:17:27,646
l'm telling you
l hope it is important.

963
01:17:28,524 --> 01:17:29,354
This is Hawkins.

964
01:17:29,691 --> 01:17:33,310
We go back to law school.
She's the prosecuting attorney.

965
01:17:33,529 --> 01:17:36,483
The son of a bitch used a little girl
as a bulletproof vest.

966
01:17:36,824 --> 01:17:39,575
Watch your language.
Nino is going to fall.

967
01:17:39,827 --> 01:17:43,160
-What about the Pookie video?
-lt helps, but it's not enough.

968
01:17:43,497 --> 01:17:45,822
Nino isn't in the tapes
at The Carter.

969
01:17:46,083 --> 01:17:47,743
He's Mr. Untouchable.

970
01:17:49,962 --> 01:17:53,295
How many more got to die?
l could have smoked him myself.

971
01:17:53,674 --> 01:17:57,173
Can we catch him in a buy?
Or get a witness to testify...

972
01:17:57,428 --> 01:17:59,088
...and connect all the dots?

973
01:17:59,346 --> 01:18:04,174
Nino's got great connections.
Can we nail any and tie them to Nino?

974
01:18:04,852 --> 01:18:06,310
Check this out.

975
01:18:06,854 --> 01:18:10,104
We got it set up so the
CMB brothers will buy from us.

976
01:18:10,858 --> 01:18:14,309
And l also got it so Nino Brown
definitely doesn't trust Gee Money.

977
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:16,479
And we'll get it on videotape.

978
01:18:39,261 --> 01:18:40,672
What's up, fellas?

979
01:18:41,263 --> 01:18:42,508
Got the bucks?

980
01:18:42,765 --> 01:18:45,434
Nice of you to make it.
Know what l'm saying?

981
01:18:45,934 --> 01:18:47,014
What can l say?

982
01:18:48,061 --> 01:18:49,639
What's taking so long?

983
01:18:50,189 --> 01:18:51,849
Nino's not moving.
Shit.

984
01:18:52,107 --> 01:18:54,563
-Let's do this.
-Open the briefcase.

985
01:18:59,239 --> 01:19:00,484
Easy!

986
01:19:00,908 --> 01:19:02,070
Very easy.

987
01:19:02,409 --> 01:19:03,738
l thought we was friends.

988
01:19:04,036 --> 01:19:06,657
l told you, it's never personal, B.

989
01:19:06,914 --> 01:19:09,665
Friends is friends. This is business.

990
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:11,156
Let's see the sample.

991
01:19:11,418 --> 01:19:12,533
Whatever.

992
01:19:19,968 --> 01:19:21,166
All here, baby.

993
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:24,176
l knew l knew Washington.
He's five-o!

994
01:19:26,475 --> 01:19:28,017
Suck-ass motherfucker!

995
01:19:30,813 --> 01:19:32,639
Punch it! Just do it!

996
01:22:55,267 --> 01:22:57,473
You cut a deal
with that motherfucker.

997
01:22:58,854 --> 01:23:01,475
Yes, you did. Yes, you did, Gee.

998
01:23:03,025 --> 01:23:04,400
Fucking Cain.

999
01:23:05,569 --> 01:23:07,312
My brother's keeper.

1000
01:23:08,488 --> 01:23:09,983
Was it this...

1001
01:23:10,866 --> 01:23:13,357
...glass dick you've been sucking on?

1002
01:23:15,621 --> 01:23:19,868
Was that it? Now l see how you
let that motherfucker infiltrate.

1003
01:23:20,209 --> 01:23:22,000
He used you, Gee.

1004
01:23:30,969 --> 01:23:34,587
Whatever happened to
"Am l my brother's keeper?"

1005
01:23:35,807 --> 01:23:37,800
You know what happened to it.

1006
01:23:40,312 --> 01:23:42,305
"The world is mine. "

1007
01:23:45,025 --> 01:23:45,974
Remember that?

1008
01:23:48,111 --> 01:23:51,563
"Everything is mine. Everything! "

1009
01:23:52,866 --> 01:23:54,360
Even my woman.

1010
01:23:55,410 --> 01:23:57,237
ls that what this is about?

1011
01:23:57,579 --> 01:23:58,955
That fucking skeezer?

1012
01:23:59,206 --> 01:24:00,866
You think l give a fuck about her?

1013
01:24:01,124 --> 01:24:03,698
Fuck that ho bitch!
l don't give a fuck about her!

1014
01:24:04,044 --> 01:24:06,037
lt ain't about her.

1015
01:24:07,714 --> 01:24:09,173
lt's about us.

1016
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:14,679
l love you, man.

1017
01:24:22,396 --> 01:24:24,554
You embarrassed me, man!

1018
01:24:27,693 --> 01:24:30,777
ln front of all them people,
you treated me like l was soft.

1019
01:24:31,029 --> 01:24:33,355
You treated me like l was spineless!

1020
01:24:34,575 --> 01:24:38,442
We built this shit!
You didn't do this shit by yourself!

1021
01:24:39,746 --> 01:24:43,115
You forgot about me, man.
Your brother.

1022
01:24:44,543 --> 01:24:46,286
What has this done to us?

1023
01:24:50,465 --> 01:24:51,628
Keisha.

1024
01:24:52,050 --> 01:24:53,248
Dead.

1025
01:24:54,261 --> 01:24:55,720
The Duh Duh Man.

1026
01:24:56,471 --> 01:24:57,385
Dead.

1027
01:24:59,808 --> 01:25:01,884
Let's just make it like it was.

1028
01:25:03,228 --> 01:25:06,146
Let's be a family.
Let's make it like it was.

1029
01:25:06,398 --> 01:25:09,933
Fuck them cars. And them bitches.
And all that shit.

1030
01:25:10,277 --> 01:25:12,269
Fuck that shit!

1031
01:25:13,739 --> 01:25:16,693
Let's do us, me and you.
Let's be a family again.

1032
01:25:28,629 --> 01:25:30,420
l'm on the run.

1033
01:25:32,466 --> 01:25:35,004
lt can never go back
the way it was.

1034
01:25:38,430 --> 01:25:42,642
But l'll tell you how
we can make it right.

1035
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:55,149
CMB.

1036
01:25:55,989 --> 01:25:57,365
CMB!

1037
01:25:57,783 --> 01:25:59,277
We all we got.

1038
01:26:02,329 --> 01:26:04,784
Am l my brother's keeper?

1039
01:26:13,298 --> 01:26:15,042
Yes, l am.

1040
01:26:25,686 --> 01:26:27,725
You know where Nino Brown lives?

1041
01:26:28,188 --> 01:26:30,560
You heard my man.
l ain't telling you shit!

1042
01:26:31,024 --> 01:26:34,109
Last summer, we won
this basketball tournament.

1043
01:26:34,361 --> 01:26:37,944
Bought the whole team new red scooters.
So kiss my ass.

1044
01:26:38,198 --> 01:26:39,229
Kiss my ass with that.

1045
01:26:39,491 --> 01:26:43,536
You know something, B?
This dude is a cop. Five-o! B, out!

1046
01:26:44,246 --> 01:26:45,111
Come here, punk!

1047
01:26:47,666 --> 01:26:49,374
l know where Nino lives.

1048
01:26:49,668 --> 01:26:52,420
He beat this kid with
a baseball bat.

1049
01:26:52,671 --> 01:26:54,877
Poured gas on him,
set him on fire...

1050
01:26:55,340 --> 01:26:57,665
...after he shorted him $5.

1051
01:26:57,926 --> 01:27:00,548
l hope you kill his black,
hardened ass.

1052
01:27:01,388 --> 01:27:03,131
He's in apartment 6C.

1053
01:27:03,515 --> 01:27:06,267
But watch out.
He got bodyguards on the roof.

1054
01:27:10,564 --> 01:27:13,055
<i>Say hello to my little friend.</i>

1055
01:27:20,616 --> 01:27:21,896
Buckwheat.

1056
01:28:23,512 --> 01:28:24,425
Punk!

1057
01:28:26,765 --> 01:28:27,547
Kill him!

1058
01:28:27,808 --> 01:28:32,055
How can you wear this and sell poison
to our people? You ain't shit!

1059
01:28:36,984 --> 01:28:37,932
Toss him to me.

1060
01:28:44,783 --> 01:28:47,108
That teacher you killed?
That was my mother!

1061
01:28:50,122 --> 01:28:52,114
Kick his black ass!

1062
01:28:55,043 --> 01:28:58,543
You've squashed and killed
these people with no retribution.

1063
01:28:59,881 --> 01:29:01,126
Get your ass up.

1064
01:29:08,265 --> 01:29:10,507
This ain't business.
This is personal.

1065
01:29:14,396 --> 01:29:15,890
Do it! Do it!

1066
01:29:16,106 --> 01:29:19,060
l want to shoot you so bad,
my dick's hard.

1067
01:29:19,359 --> 01:29:20,735
Coming through!

1068
01:29:22,571 --> 01:29:25,276
Come on, Scotty.
We'll do it the right way.

1069
01:29:26,992 --> 01:29:28,023
l'll testify.

1070
01:29:28,285 --> 01:29:30,692
Even if it means my life,
l will testify.

1071
01:29:30,954 --> 01:29:33,410
Come on.
We can't go out like this.

1072
01:29:33,790 --> 01:29:35,035
Put the gun down.

1073
01:29:43,633 --> 01:29:46,125
Don't throw your life away
on a piece of shit.

1074
01:29:50,682 --> 01:29:52,509
Give me the gun.
l'll do it!

1075
01:30:03,779 --> 01:30:05,487
l'll be out in a week.

1076
01:30:06,782 --> 01:30:08,490
You're a dead man.

1077
01:30:16,041 --> 01:30:20,619
Was the defendant, Mr. Nino Brown,
head of the CMB?

1078
01:30:33,350 --> 01:30:35,841
Remove the hat and the sunglasses.

1079
01:30:38,188 --> 01:30:41,889
Detective Appleton, when you
infiltrated the CMB...

1080
01:30:42,150 --> 01:30:44,558
...did the defendant, Mr. Nino Brown...

1081
01:30:44,820 --> 01:30:49,695
...attempt to buy two and a half kilos
of cocaine from you?

1082
01:30:50,367 --> 01:30:52,573
Can Michael Jordan slam dunk?

1083
01:30:52,911 --> 01:30:55,367
Of course he did.
He's a dope dealer.

1084
01:30:55,622 --> 01:30:58,030
That's what they do,
buy and sell dope.

1085
01:30:59,626 --> 01:31:00,907
l'm not guilty.

1086
01:31:01,378 --> 01:31:03,121
You're the one who's guilty.

1087
01:31:03,964 --> 01:31:07,380
Lawmakers, the politicians,
the Colombian drug lords.

1088
01:31:07,634 --> 01:31:10,505
All you who lobby against
making drugs legal.

1089
01:31:10,971 --> 01:31:13,722
Just like with alcohol
during Prohibition.

1090
01:31:13,974 --> 01:31:15,765
You're the one who's guilty.

1091
01:31:17,102 --> 01:31:19,640
Let's kick the ballistics here.

1092
01:31:19,938 --> 01:31:22,476
Ain't no Uzis made in Harlem.

1093
01:31:22,816 --> 01:31:26,814
Not one of us in here
owns a poppy field.

1094
01:31:27,112 --> 01:31:30,148
This thing is bigger than Nino Brown.
This is big business.

1095
01:31:30,449 --> 01:31:32,441
This is the American way.

1096
01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:37,243
l'm sure that the court
was enlightened...

1097
01:31:37,497 --> 01:31:39,823
...by your geopolitical tirade.

1098
01:31:40,167 --> 01:31:44,081
Unfortunately, society at large
is not on trial here.

1099
01:31:44,379 --> 01:31:46,835
You are, Mr. Brown.

1100
01:31:47,549 --> 01:31:49,340
Were you or were you not...

1101
01:31:49,676 --> 01:31:54,422
...head of the narcotics consortium,
the murderously bloody...

1102
01:31:54,681 --> 01:31:56,175
...CMB?

1103
01:31:58,518 --> 01:32:01,519
l could not hear you.
Would you please speak up?

1104
01:32:01,813 --> 01:32:03,972
Yes, l was a member.

1105
01:32:04,524 --> 01:32:07,276
But l was forced into
this way of life.

1106
01:32:07,486 --> 01:32:10,190
l've been dealing drugs
since l was 12.

1107
01:32:10,530 --> 01:32:14,314
l didn't have the chances
that you have, Miss Hawkins.

1108
01:32:14,576 --> 01:32:19,203
l wasn't born with a silver spoon
in my mouth, Miss Hawkins.

1109
01:32:21,374 --> 01:32:25,455
l wanted to get out,
but they threatened to kill my mother.

1110
01:32:25,712 --> 01:32:29,081
Who are you talking about,
Mr. Brown? What "they"?

1111
01:32:29,883 --> 01:32:30,879
They.

1112
01:32:32,010 --> 01:32:34,679
Look at him. Kareem Akbar.

1113
01:32:36,098 --> 01:32:40,047
The educated brother from the bank.
He's the head of the CMB.

1114
01:32:40,310 --> 01:32:41,804
The brains behind the whole thing.

1115
01:32:42,104 --> 01:32:45,140
This is bigger than Nino Brown,
and l got a list to prove it.

1116
01:32:45,399 --> 01:32:48,399
lf l'm going down, l'm taking
a lot of people with me.

1117
01:32:48,860 --> 01:32:51,897
-Order in the court!
-Can l speak with my lawyer?

1118
01:33:11,091 --> 01:33:14,127
Your Honor, may counsel
approach the bench?

1119
01:33:16,096 --> 01:33:18,801
-What's going on?
-l don't know.

1120
01:33:22,644 --> 01:33:24,103
What's the discussion?

1121
01:33:31,236 --> 01:33:33,727
The court is not pleased
with this application.

1122
01:33:34,156 --> 01:33:37,690
You understand that by pleading
guilty to a lesser charge...

1123
01:33:38,118 --> 01:33:43,159
...the court, under law, can impose
a sentence of three years to life...

1124
01:33:43,582 --> 01:33:47,626
...with parole eligibility
after 12 months. Do you understand?

1125
01:33:50,130 --> 01:33:51,375
Absolutely.

1126
01:33:52,841 --> 01:33:54,501
How'd you let this happen?

1127
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:58,674
We wanted some of the crack
off the streets. l wanted Nino too.

1128
01:33:58,930 --> 01:34:02,798
He gave up his connections,
and Powell wanted to make the deal.

1129
01:34:03,977 --> 01:34:04,890
Let's go.

1130
01:34:07,105 --> 01:34:09,098
This court is now adjourned.

1131
01:34:10,150 --> 01:34:13,270
What? All he gets is a year?

1132
01:34:13,570 --> 01:34:14,945
This ain't happening.

1133
01:34:16,323 --> 01:34:18,944
l should have
killed you myself, bitch!

1134
01:34:20,035 --> 01:34:22,324
That's the difference between
you and me.

1135
01:34:22,662 --> 01:34:25,663
Don't get mad, Tito. lt's the law.

1136
01:34:26,792 --> 01:34:27,622
Sucks, huh?

1137
01:34:30,420 --> 01:34:33,955
When this is over with,
you can come and work for me.

1138
01:34:39,304 --> 01:34:41,297
Did you turn state's evidence?

1139
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:43,264
Did you sell out CMB?

1140
01:34:43,517 --> 01:34:45,758
-Are you pleased with the outcome?
-Absolutely.

1141
01:34:45,977 --> 01:34:50,474
The justice system is the greatest.
l'm proud to be an American.

1142
01:34:50,732 --> 01:34:52,855
-Hi, Mom.
-ldolater!

1143
01:34:53,110 --> 01:34:56,194
Your soul is required in hell!

1144
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:50:500
Although this is a fictional story,
there are Nino Browns in every major city in America.
If we don't confront the problem realistically --
without empty slogans and promises -- then
drugs will continue to destroy our country.
