1
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:05,231
我能听到别人听不到的
<i>My ears hear what others cannot hear.</i>

2
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:11,571
能看到别人看不到的  微小的遥远的东西
<i>Small, faraway things people cannot normally see are visible to me.</i>

3
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,034
这些感知是渴望了一生的结果
<i>These senses are the fruits of a lifetime of longing.</i>

4
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,495
渴望被拯救
<i>Longing to be rescued.</i>

5
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,205
渴望被补全
<i>To be completed.</i>

6
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,668
就像渴望被风吹起的裙摆
<i>Just as the skirt needs the wind to billow...</i>

7
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:28,588
我并非是由我自身构成
<i>...I'm not formed by things that are of myself alone.</i>

8
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:32,342
我系着爸爸的腰带  穿着妈妈的上衣
<i>I wear my father's belt tied around my mother's blouse.</i>

9
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:36,554
鞋子是我叔叔的
<i>And shoes which are from my uncle.</i>

10
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:39,557
这就是我
<i>This is me.</i>

11
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,148
就像一朵花不能选择它的颜色
<i>Just as a flower does not choose its color...</i>

12
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:51,486
我们也无法为我们的将来负责
<i>...we are not responsible for what we have come to be.</i>

13
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,950
当你意识到这个的时候  你就自由了
<i>Only once you realize this do you become free.</i>

14
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,119
长大
<i>And to become adult...</i>

15
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,913
就自由了
<i>...is to become free.</i>

16
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:13,610
生日快乐

17
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,210
生日快乐  印蒂雅

18
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:46,392
斯托克

理查德  不要
Richard! No!

21
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,693
一个忠于家庭的男人
A family man...

22
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,737
疼爱妻子伊芙琳的丈夫
...devoted husband to his wife, Evelyn...

23
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:01,491
爱护女儿印蒂雅的父亲
...loving father to his daughter, India.

24
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,120
他是我们镇子的楷模
He was a model to our town...

25
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:09,165
这样一个率真  正直的人
...and of what it means to be a man who walks through the world...

26
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:13,670
去了天国
...with openness, honesty and integrity.

27
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,633
-印蒂雅  -命运把理查德·斯托克
<i>-India?</i> -Richard Stoker was taken from us...

28
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,343
永远地带离了我们
...by a cruel twist of fate.

29
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:21,928
印蒂雅
<i>India?</i>

30
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:25,765
原因不明也无法理解
The reasons for which are unknown and unknowable.

31
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:29,310
一起任何人都无法预料的意外
By an accident nobody would have predicted.

32
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:33,064
哪怕是理查德这样
It would have been impossible for even an outstanding architect...

33
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,649
接触的建筑师
<i>...like Richard...</i>

34
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,110
也无法理解上帝的旨意
<i>...to understand God's great design.</i>

35
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,081
印蒂雅
India?

36
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,294
印蒂雅
India.

37
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,133
客人快到了
The guests will be here soon.

38
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:03,011
你可以去厨房给加里克夫人打打下手吗
Can you help Mrs. McGarrick in the kitchen?

39
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,688
拜托
Please?

40
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,569
别这副表情  印蒂雅
Don't do this to me, India.

41
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,363
今天不行
Not today.

42
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,419
他们撬开他车的时候
When they pried open his car...

43
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,297
-他的尸体  -都烧焦了
-...you know, his body was burned... -To a crisp.

44
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,091
太可怕了
Terrible accident.

45
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,176
好可伶  印蒂雅和她爸爸那么亲近
Poor thing. India was so close to her father.

46
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,970
-谁来照顾她呀  -她还有妈妈呢
-Who's gonna look after her? -She's still got her mother.

47
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:49,349
她妈妈照顾她  得了吧
Her mother look after her? More like the other way around.

48
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:52,602
你知道吗  这起意外太奇怪了
You know what? This whole accident is so strange.

49
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,188
你听到传言了吗
Have you heard all the rumors floating around...?

50
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,944
你不觉得他本来要过桥的吗
You don't think he meant to drive off the bridge?

51
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,571
-为什么他要跑到两州外的地方  -不知道
-Why did he have to go two states away? -I don't know.

52
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:07,242
-还好吗  -是  加里克夫人
-Everything all right? -Yes, Mrs. McGarrick.

53
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:26,886
我怀疑是不是冰箱里放久了
Now I'm wondering if I kept them in the fridge too long.

54
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:31,057
你觉得呢  我是不是太舍不得辣椒粉了
What do you think? Was I too stingy with the paprika?

55
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:38,231
你这邪恶的鸡蛋让我想起小时候
Your deviled eggs remind me of when I was a little girl.

56
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:44,029
你也许长大了  但还是把蛋壳搞到地上去
Well, you may be all grown up, but you still get eggshells all over the floor.

57
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,489
你的鞋是不是小了
Have you outgrown your shoes?

58
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,664
你找到生日礼物没
Did you find your birthday present yet?

59
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,463
我找到了盒子  但里面是空的
<i>I found the box, but it was empty.</i>

60
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,007
你确定吗
Are you sure?

61
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,884
检查过了吗
Did you check?

62
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,511
再检查一次
Check again.

63
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:13,808
每年我都以为是爸爸把鞋子送给我做生日礼物
Every year I thought it was my father who left me shoes on my birthday.

64
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,311
但是这次
But all this time, it's been--

65
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,483
告诉我这是什么钥匙
Tell me what it opens.

66
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,444
我哪知道
How would I know?

67
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:26,988
好吧
All right.

68
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,490
那是我弟弟
That was my brother....

69
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:37,457
开始它们是四个
You know, originally they were part of a set of four...

70
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,709
但是我小时候打碎了一个
...but then I broke one as a kid.

71
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:45,674
我现在回来发现肯定有人打碎了另一个
Now I'm seeing in this house someone must have let another break.

72
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:46,925
不  不是我
No, it wasn't me.

73
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:51,763
我们搬进来时  女佣拆包裹打碎了一个
When we-- When we moved in, it broke as the housekeepers were unpacking it.

74
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:56,017
印蒂雅  过来和查理叔叔打个招呼
India. Come and say hello to your Uncle Charlie.

75
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,735
印蒂雅  过来
<i>India? Come over.</i>

76
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,321
待会见
See you soon.

77
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:10,949
你好  印蒂雅
Hello, India.

78
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,161
过来
Come on.

79
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,958
她不喜欢和人接触
She hates to be touched.

80
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,127
即便我是她妈
I'm her mother.

81
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,004
多古怪
What a curse.

82
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,674
查理  理查德以前说
You know, Charlie, Richard used to say...

83
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,385
我们永远找不到你了
...that we had lost you to the rest of the world forever.

84
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,513
印蒂雅  你怎么脸色这么差
Why, India, you're white as a sheet.

85
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,765
出什么事了吗
Is something wrong?

86
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,686
是啊
Yes.

87
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,063
我爸爸死了
My father is dead.

88
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,100
好美
<i>How beautiful.</i>

89
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,314
理查德引以为豪印蒂雅的打猎技术
Richard was so proud of India's hunting

90
00:09:21,476 --> 00:09:24,314
他把她的每个猎物都制成标本
that he stuffed every single thing she killed.

91
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,401
真是浪费时间
What a tragic waste of life.

92
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,904
它们住在森林深处
These live particularly deep in the forest.

93
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,406
肯定很难捉到
They'd be very hard to catch.

94
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,745
我猜理查德和印蒂雅配合默契
I guess Richard and India were a good team.

95
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:53,760
他参加亲哥哥的葬礼居然不穿黑色  太不尊重了
It's kind of disrespectful, him not wearing black to his own brother's funeral.

96
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,805
他肯定刚从中东还是什么地方回来
He must have come back today from the Middle East or something.

97
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,307
是在伊斯坦布尔什么地方挖东西吗
It's just part of a dig in some old part of Istanbul?

98
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:02,894
不  我觉得他是在找不一样的东西  印尼黄金
No, I think he was digging for something quite different. Gold in Indonesia.

99
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:06,064
真的很感谢您今早的悼词
I really want to thank you for your words this morning.

100
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:09,401
你和理查德称得上这些
Well, you and Richard deserve every word.

101
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,057
酒不错
The wine's good.

102
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,879
你在这  来这边
There you are. Come and join us.

103
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,923
他是理查德的弟弟
This is Richard's brother.

104
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,008
你好
Hello.

105
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,634
-他回来了  -幸会
-He's back. -Nice to meet you.

106
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,803
布鲁姆夫妇是我们的好朋友
These are the Blooms, good friends of ours.

107
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,013
晚上好
Good evening.

108
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,848
我都不知道理查德还有个弟弟
I didn't know Richard had a brother.

109
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,058
幸会
Nice to meet you.

110
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,976
为你亲人的逝去  我们很遗憾
We're sorry for your loss.

111
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,978
你怎么认识理查德的
How did you know Richard?

112
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:36,071
他24岁在牛津拿到博士学位
Got his doctorate from Oxford when he was 24.

113
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,739
斯托克很有头脑
Stoker sure had the brains.

114
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,158
是啊  看看印蒂雅
Yeah. Just look at India.

115
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,456
又见面了
Hello, again.

116
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,969
你知道你为什么不爽吗
Do you want to know why you feel at a disadvantage right now?

117
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,973
因为我之前都不知道你的存在
Because I didn't know you existed until today?

118
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:07,018
因为你站得低
Because you're standing below me.

119
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:39,092
你和我爸爸很像
You look like my father.

120
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,680
很遗憾
I am so sorry.

121
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,850
你也失去了亲人
It's your loss too.

122
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,904
大概一分钟以内  你妈妈会告诉你
In about 60 seconds, your mother's gonna tell you...

123
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:02,782
我要在这待一段时间
...that I'm gonna be staying here for a while...

124
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,994
但我希望这是你的决定
...but I want it to be your decision too.

125
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,788
为什么
Why?

126
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,208
因为
Because...

127
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,253
这对我来说很重要
...it's important to me.

128
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:58,171
花园很棒
This really is a beautiful garden.

129
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:02,467
土壤
The soil...

130
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,513
松软
...is so soft.

131
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,556
适宜挖掘
Good for digging.

132
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:35,625
我不知道你用意何在
I'm not exactly sure what you're driving at.

133
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,546
我不想惹麻烦
I don't want any trouble.

134
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,215
我是唯一一个知道所有事情的人
I am the only one who would know anything about it.

135
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,551
我做了你让我做的事情
I did everything you asked of me.

136
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,970
我每年都来通知你
I kept you informed every year.

137
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:52,434
我一直是你的眼睛  耳朵  左右手
I was your eyes, your ears, your hands all this time.

138
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,686
你现在就像用尿布的小娃娃
You're acting like you're in diapers now...

139
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:58,565
从你是孩子起你就那样了  我受够了
...and you've done this to me ever since you were a child. I'm tired of it.

140
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,275

142
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,500
加里克夫人
Mrs. McGarrick?

143
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,506
她去哪了
Where is she?

144
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,425
我也没见着
I haven't seen her yet.

145

151
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:50,033
你今天打算干嘛
What are you doing today?

152
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:52,994
准备
Thought I'd...

153
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:56,456
拉上窗帘  停掉钟表
...draw the curtains, stop the clocks...

154
00:15:56,539 --> 00:16:00,335
按下镜子  宅我屋里
...cover the mirrors and then retire to my room.

155
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,462
别这样
Don't be morbid.

156
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:05,215
别穿这裙子了  这什么裙子
Get rid of that dress. What is that?

157

丧裙
It's my mourning attire.

158
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:10,679
出去转转怎么样
Why don't we get out of here?

159
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,140
逛逛街  吃吃冰淇
Go shopping. We could get some ice cream.

160
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:18,311
在维多利亚时代  寡妇要为丈夫哀悼两年
In Victorian times, a widow was expected to mourn her husband for two years.

161
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:20,313
至少
At least.

162
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:22,524
-印蒂雅  -在中国古代

我们去吃吃冰淇林  呼吸呼吸新鲜空气
You and me, ice cream, fresh air.

165
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,328
来嘛  你老是跟他去打猎
Come on, all these years of hunting trips with him...

166
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:38,498
我只要求这一个下午而已
...and all I'm asking for is one afternoon with me.

167
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,584
你爸爸也希望看到这样的
That's what your father would have wanted.

168
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:48,717
你知道你爸爸和我总是不亲近
You know, your father and I weren't always so distant.

169
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:52,178
我怀念他
I miss when he was...

170
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:55,932
年轻的时候
...young.

成熟的香气
Mature aroma.

175
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,263
年份很好
You chose a good year.

176
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:42,140
你不能和年份尚浅的酒比
You can't compare it to a younger wine.

177
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:44,726
丹宁酸太多

178
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,978
还没准备好被打开
Not ready to be open.

179
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:50,273
你应该加入我们  印蒂雅  敞篷车
You should have come with us, India. Oh, the open top...

180
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:53,568
外面的空气  太棒了

181
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:56,488
半路查理叔叔给你买了冰淇林

183

Did I get it right?

184
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:04,120
我喜欢漩涡混合的
I like the swirl kind.

185
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:08,625
你可以自己混合  懒姑娘
You can make the swirl yourself, you lazy thing.

186
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:11,044
加里克夫人呢
Where's Mrs. McGarrick?

187
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:12,420
不在这
She's still not here.

188
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:14,756
什么  那我们吃什么
What? What are we supposed to do?

189
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,093
我厨艺不好
I'm not much in the kitchen.

190
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:20,428
我会一点点
I can cook a little.

191
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:23,098
不用你做
No, you don't have to do that.

192
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:24,432
我很乐意
I'd love to.

193
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,104
查理  你到底是谁
Charlie, who in the world are you?

194
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:34,651
印蒂雅  把这放到冰柜里好吗
India, would you take these down to the freezer, please?

195
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:40,115
按叔叔说的做
Do as your uncle tells you.

196
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:55,088
-谢谢  -谢谢  印蒂雅
-Thank you. -Thank you, India.

197
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,412
下面很冷吗
Too cold down there?

198
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,125
不会
No.

199
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:36,356
以前理查德
You know, there was a time...

200
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:39,359
也会这样做饭
...Richard used to cook meals like this.

201
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,862
是吧  印蒂雅
Wasn't there, India?

202
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:48,076
哦  那会儿你还没出生呢
I'm sorry, of course. That was before you were born.

203
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:53,373
你在哪学的厨艺  查理
Where did you learn to cook like this, Charlie?

204
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:55,875
跟着雅克恩夫人学的
Madame Jacquin.

205
00:22:56,292 --> 00:23:01,089
她在图卢兹开了家米其林星级餐馆  叫L'Institution
She ran a Michelin-starred restaurant outside of Toulouse called "L'Institution."

206
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:04,676
一个女厨子
A female chef.

207
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:07,929
在她的观念里  没有女人会的事情
In her opinion, there was nothing a man could master...

208
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:10,015
男人学不会的
...that a woman couldn't make.

209
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:11,933
什么意思
What do you mean?

210
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:14,686
用法语说听上去更好
It sounds better in French.

211
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:19,232
回家路上我说了吗  你法语口音很赞
Did I tell you on the way home? Your French accent is perfect.

212
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:24,571
这要归功于我受过的一流的教育
One of the perks of a first-class education.

213
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:27,657
即便余生都被关在这间屋子里
I could stay locked up in this house for the rest of my life...

214
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:31,536
我依旧可以说一口漂亮的法语
...yet still speak impeccable French.

215
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:35,623
我知道你不打算一辈子困在这间屋子里
I know you're not gonna spend the rest of your life locked up in this house.

216
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:39,169
你平时都干嘛  我想了解我的嫂子
How do you spend your days? I want to know my brother's wife.

217
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:45,050
不知道从何说起
Oh, I don't know where to start.

218
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:50,263
查理  你都没吃东西
Charlie, you didn't even touch your food.

219
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:53,183
你在我们的食物里下毒了吗
Did you put poison in the food just for us girls?

220
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:57,145
但是印蒂雅吃光了
But India ate everything.

221
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:00,940
像舔过的一样
Practically licked it clean.

222
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:07,906
很高兴你喜欢吃
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

223
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:10,742
我能拿点别的给你吗
Now, can I get you anything else?

224
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:13,578
冰淇林怎么样
Maybe some ice cream?

225
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:15,413
不
No.

226
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:18,041
要说  不  谢谢你
"No, thank you."

227
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:22,087
我是说  不  谢谢你
I mean, no, thank you.

228
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:29,052
你想晚饭后给我们弹首歌吗
Would you like to play something for us after dinner?

229
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:31,012
我不想
I don't think so.

230
00:24:31,096 --> 00:24:32,263
你呢
Would you?

231
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:34,057
印蒂雅
India.

232
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,226
我是说  不  谢谢你
I mean, no, thank you.

233
00:24:44,526 --> 00:24:46,528
你为什么不告诉我我还有个叔叔
Why didn't you tell me I had an uncle?

234
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:50,281
我自己都不了解查理
Because I barely knew about Charlie myself.

235
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:53,993
我认识你爸爸没多久他就环游世界去了
I mean, he's been traveling the world for as long as I've known your father.

236
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:56,121
他以前和我说
You know, he used to say to me:

237
00:24:56,538 --> 00:25:00,333
不回家的家人哪叫家人
"What kind of family is family that never comes home?"

238
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:05,046
别讨论理查德了  失陪
Let's stop talking about Richard. Excuse me.

239
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:09,134
抱歉
I'm sorry.

240
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:47,047
1994年
1994.

241
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:53,053
你出生的那年
The year you were born.

242
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:30,840
你想干嘛
What do you want from me?

243
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:32,676
和你做朋友
To be friends.

244
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,020
我们没必要做朋友
We don't need to be friends.

245
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:49,359
我们是家人
We're family.

246
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:53,780
全神贯注地观察需要时间
<i>It takes time to observe attentively.</i>

247
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:57,325
等待我们的眼睛
Wait for the moment that our eyes...

248
00:26:57,409 --> 00:27:00,537
最终穿透物体的内部

249
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,080
看  马弗

250
00:27:02,163 --> 00:27:04,541
看到那些花儿了吗  它们悬挂的样子
...see that flower? The way it just hangs there?

251
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:06,668
我的眼睛穿透了你的内在
My eyes are penetrating the inside of you.

252
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:11,047
仔细观察  你会注意到这个植物

00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:28,106
有事吗  费尔德曼先生

259
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,739

我在教他弹琴

270
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:15,815
查理叔叔完全是个初学者

Why don't you take a hot shower first or you'll catch a coId. Come on. Here.

277

你好  印蒂雅
Hello, India.

278
00:30:41,174 --> 00:30:43,385
我拿了理查德的皮带

279
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:46,096
他衣服有点大
His whites are a little big.

280
00:30:47,055 --> 00:30:48,098
准备好了吗
Ready?

281
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:49,641
走了
Let's go.

282
00:30:59,192 --> 00:31:01,111
印蒂雅
India?

283
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:04,906
是我呀
It's me.

284
00:31:04,989 --> 00:31:07,826
来给金姨一个拥抱
Come and give your Auntie Gin a hug.

285
00:31:17,252 --> 00:31:21,423
-你什么时候来的  格温多琳  -4点左右
-What time did you get in, Gwendolyn? -Around 4.

286
00:31:21,715 --> 00:31:23,550
好吧
That's right.

287
00:31:24,968 --> 00:31:26,094
你什么时候走
And when do you fly out?

288
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:31,182
看情况
That remains to be seen.

289
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:34,102
我本来想待个一两天
I'd originally planned to stay for only a day or two...

290
00:31:34,185 --> 00:31:38,023
现在在考虑是不是要多待几天
...but now I'm thinking I should stay a bit longer.

291
00:31:38,106 --> 00:31:40,400
多陪陪印蒂雅
Spend a little quality time with India.

292
00:31:42,944 --> 00:31:44,070
对她真好
How nice for her.

293
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:48,700
-查理  -金姨
-Charles? -Auntie Gin.

294
00:31:48,783 --> 00:31:50,493
你来这多久了
How long have you been here?

295
00:31:51,286 --> 00:31:53,038
不长
Not long.

296
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:57,125
我们很感激他能放下欧洲的事情赶过来
We're so grateful that he's taken time away from his commitments in Europe.

297
00:31:58,168 --> 00:32:00,086
-欧洲  -是的
-Europe? -Yes.

298
00:32:14,851 --> 00:32:20,565
伊维  饭后我们聊聊吧
Evie, dear, after dinner, I was thinking perhaps you and I could talk.

299
00:32:21,107 --> 00:32:23,068
-我们正在聊呀  -单独的
-We are talking. -Alone.

300
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:26,071
-关于什么  -比方说理查德
-About what? -Like Richard, for instance.

301
00:32:26,154 --> 00:32:28,448
-理查德  -是的  伊维  理查德
-Richard? -Yes, Evie. Richard.

302
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:30,325
我侄儿  你亡夫
My nephew, your late husband.

303
00:32:30,408 --> 00:32:32,994
我没那么快就忘掉他的名字
I don't think I'll be forgetting his name any time soon.

304
00:32:33,078 --> 00:32:38,792
当然不会  我是想有没有什么要安排的
Of course not. I just thought there might be arrangements to be made.

305
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:41,461
都安排好了
Things to be settled.

306
00:32:41,544 --> 00:32:46,091
我们律师说了都和你无关  你不在遗嘱里
Our lawyer has said none of this has anything to do with you. You're not in the will.

307
00:32:46,174 --> 00:32:49,636
不是这个  我是说一些不一样的事情
No, dear, I mean something entirely different.

308
00:32:50,136 --> 00:32:52,514
比方说
Like, for example...

309
00:32:52,597 --> 00:32:57,352
聊聊你和查理这样住在这里
...maybe we could talk about your living here with Charlie like this.

310
00:33:00,105 --> 00:33:04,275
指责我  金姨倒是一点都不害羞
Auntie Gin isn't shy when it comes to expressing her opinions about me.

311
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:08,071
就像理查德向我求婚时候
Like when Richard asked me to marry him. What Auntie Gin might be surprised...

312
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:11,991
金姨可能很惊讶那些流言蜚语一点都没被听到
...to learn is that those opinions are neither wanted, needed, or appreciated.

313
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:14,369
-伊维  -你到我家  指责我
-Evie-- -You come into my home and attack me...

314
00:33:14,452 --> 00:33:16,579
在这种时候
...at a time like this.

315
00:33:16,663 --> 00:33:18,081
伊维
Evie--

316
00:33:24,462 --> 00:33:27,674
我觉得金姨不是那个意思
I'm sure Auntie Gin didn't mean anything.

317
00:33:28,133 --> 00:33:29,926
你不是那个意思吧
You didn't mean anything by it, did you?

318
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:31,720
没有
No.

319
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:35,265
当然没有  亲爱的伊维
No, of course not, Evie dear.

320
00:33:35,932 --> 00:33:40,353
你们两个饭后都不给我们弹个曲吗
Now, would either of you two like to play something for us after dinner?

321
00:33:41,146 --> 00:33:42,981
-不  谢谢你  -不  谢谢你
-No, thank you. -No, thank you.

322
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,819
晚安  金姨
Good night, Auntie Gin.

323
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:51,239
别在意伊维  她就是太累了
Don't mind Evie. She's just tired.

324
00:33:52,032 --> 00:33:54,075
你住哪里
What was the name of your hotel again?

325
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:58,997
-比尔提默  -比尔提默
-The Biltmore. -The Biltmore.

326
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,917
也许我们可以一起吃早餐
Maybe we could have breakfast together.

327
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:05,003
-就我们俩  -不一定
-Just us girls. -Oh, I'm not sure.

328
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:09,174
-送到比尔提默  -我早上会头疼
-Can you take her to the Biltmore Hotel? -I'll probably have a headache in the morning.

329
00:34:09,257 --> 00:34:13,178
-慢点开  -金姨  今晚留下来
-Drive carefully. -Auntie Gin, stay the night here.

330
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:19,017
今晚我很开心
You made the evening much nicer.

331
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,644
谢谢  亲爱的
Oh, thank you, dear.

332
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:27,359
但是我这个老女人要时间休整  晚安  孩子
But an old woman needs time on her own to recover. Good night, sweet child.

333
00:34:29,194 --> 00:34:30,904
打给我
Call me.

334
00:34:39,746 --> 00:34:43,166
比尔提默附近有其他酒店吗
Are there any other hotels in town besides the Biltmore?

335
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:48,004
食物紧缺的时候  即便是亲人也没意义
<i>Even family ties have no meaning when food is scarce.</i>

336
00:34:48,088 --> 00:34:52,842
这只知道在打猎中没有哥哥的份儿
<i>This one knows there is no room for his brother in the hunt.</i>

337
00:34:52,926 --> 00:34:58,932
手足之争看似残酷  实则是适者生存
<i>While this sibling rivalry may seem cruel, in the end, it is for the best.</i>

338
00:34:59,891 --> 00:35:03,478
每一天的打猎都使得鹰更成熟
<i>Each day in the hunt brings the eagle closer to maturity.</i>

339
00:35:09,818 --> 00:35:10,944
它自己的雏鹰
<i>--and chicks of his own.</i>

340
00:35:11,027 --> 00:35:15,490
最有耐心的捕食者  黑鹰能盘旋四个小时
<i>The most patient of predators, the black eagle can circle for hours...</i>

341
00:35:15,573 --> 00:35:18,785
等待最佳时机  给予致命一击
<i>...waiting for the perfect moment to strike.</i>

342
00:35:18,868 --> 00:35:23,623
鱼类给它正在成长的身体提供很多营养
<i>The fish will provide much needed nourishment for her growing chicks.</i>

343
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:44,060
我想确认下有没有人打进电话
I was wondering if anyone had turned in a cell phone.

344
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:48,565
可能登记时漏掉了
I think I may have dropped it when I was checking in.

345
00:35:49,149 --> 00:35:51,943
你确定吗
Are you absolutely certain?

346
00:35:52,444 --> 00:35:59,451
好的  等等  我要拨出按哪个号码
All right. Oh, wait, wait. What number do I have to press to dial out?

347
00:35:59,951 --> 00:36:02,746
9  好的  我也这么觉得
Nine. Yes, I thought so.

348
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:53,922
宾馆
349
00:36:56,925 --> 00:36:58,802
晚上请按铃

349
00:37:03,139 --> 00:37:05,392
来吧
<i>Come on.</i>

350
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:08,937
山上可容不得胆小鬼
<i>The mountains are no place for the faint of heart.</i>

351
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:12,482
陡峭地形和严寒气候
<i>The steep terrain and harsh climate make a challenging climate...</i>

352
00:37:12,565 --> 00:37:14,442
对于即便是最强大的动物都是挑战
<i>...for even the strongest of species.</i>

353
00:37:23,326 --> 00:37:24,619
翅膀就代表自由
<i>--wings are freedom.</i>

354
00:37:27,038 --> 00:37:32,210
虽然鹰更愿意自己找寻配偶  帮帮忙也没什么不对
<i>--while the eagle prefers to find its own meals, there is nothing wrong in having a little help.</i>

355
00:37:32,794 --> 00:37:36,840
自然界的任何优势都是天赐  剩下的
<i>Any advantage in nature is to be appreciated, and what the left....</i>

356
00:37:39,175 --> 00:37:44,180
对于明天要继续捕猎的饥饿的鸟类来说是一场丰盛大餐
<i>--a hearty meal for the hungry bird who lived to hunt another day.</i>

357
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:08,830
13磅重  翼长7尺
<i>--thirteen pounds and a wingspan of nearly 7 feet.</i>

358
00:38:23,928 --> 00:38:27,057
你说你住比尔提默酒店的
You said you were staying at the Biltmore Hotel...

359
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,184
可是你在这
...and yet, here you are.

360
00:38:30,602 --> 00:38:32,270
我打了出租车公司的电话
I even had to call the cab company.

361
00:38:42,072 --> 00:38:45,116
被捕食者没有预料到捕食者会在高空一直盘旋
<i>--prey does not suspect the hunter is circling high above...</i>

362
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:48,661
出其不意攻其无备
<i>...and is taken completely by surprise.</i>

363
00:39:38,086 --> 00:39:42,048
-嘿嘿  看看谁来了  -开玩笑呢吧
-Hey, yo, yo. Look who's here. -No kidding?

364
00:39:42,132 --> 00:39:45,051
-是吗  真的吗  -是吗
-Is it--? Is it true? -Is it?

365
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:46,886
米德本高中

366
00:39:51,516 --> 00:39:52,559
拿着
Yo, check this out.

367
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:55,895
-我跟你说  她会说话  -试试看
-I'm telling you, she can talk, bro. -Well, let's find out.

368
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:58,732
-怪人  -好啦
-Oh, creepy, man. -All right.

369
00:39:58,815 --> 00:40:00,567
斯托克
Hey, Stoker.

370
00:40:09,743 --> 00:40:11,745
-斯托克  -去哪
<i>-Hey, Stoker. -Where you going?</i>

371
00:40:11,828 --> 00:40:13,705
跟你说话呢
I'm talking to you.

372
00:40:15,415 --> 00:40:17,500
还是你叫斯卓克[按摩师  这里是双关]
Or do you go by Stroker now?

373
00:40:17,584 --> 00:40:20,211
因为我听说你妈妈和
<i>Because I hear that's what your mom's been doing...</i>

374
00:40:20,295 --> 00:40:22,297
你叔叔干的那事
<i>...to your uncle.</i>

375
00:40:23,631 --> 00:40:25,633
你是不是也参与了
You been getting in on that?

376
00:40:28,053 --> 00:40:29,971
有话要说吗
What did you say?

377
00:40:30,055 --> 00:40:32,974
-她说话了  -你说什么
-She speaks. -"What did you say?"

378
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,227
你听到了  斯卓克
I think you heard me, Stroker.

379
00:40:36,811 --> 00:40:38,021
再说一遍
Say that again?

380
00:40:41,274 --> 00:40:45,236
好吧  你最好小心点  斯卓克
All right. I think you'd better watch your step, Stroker.

381
00:40:45,487 --> 00:40:48,156
你知道惹恼了我有什么后果吗
You know what happens to little girls who mess with me?

382
00:40:49,074 --> 00:40:51,159
看好
Watch this.

383
00:40:54,704 --> 00:40:55,789
怎么样  贱人
What's up, bitch?

384
00:40:56,998 --> 00:40:58,792
怎么样
What's up?

385
00:41:10,553 --> 00:41:12,681
-怎么了怎么了  -天哪
-Hey, come here, you all right? -Oh, my God.

386
00:41:12,764 --> 00:41:14,140
还好吗
You okay?

387
00:41:14,516 --> 00:41:17,560
够了  皮茨
All right, Pitts. That's enough.

388
00:41:17,644 --> 00:41:18,812
滚开  维普
Get out of here, Whip.

389
00:41:20,146 --> 00:41:23,108
玩蛋去  混蛋
Follow the bouncing ball, jackass.

390
00:41:23,191 --> 00:41:25,652
别惹她
She's not interested.

391
00:41:28,071 --> 00:41:29,072
走了走了
Dude, let's just go.

392
00:41:30,532 --> 00:41:34,035
好吧  就像我想在这贱人身上浪费时间一样  走了
Yeah, like I enjoy wasting my time on this bitch, anyways. Let's go.

393
00:41:34,911 --> 00:41:37,247
-怪人  -抱歉
-Freak. -Sorry about that.

394
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:39,416
他是混球  别理他
He's an A-hole, okay? Just ignore him.

395
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,380
你去哪
Where you going?

396
00:42:14,117 --> 00:42:15,952
下面冷吗
<i>Too cold down there?</i>

397
00:42:25,045 --> 00:42:28,173
印蒂雅  把这些拿到冰柜里
<i>India, would you take these down to the freezer, please?</i>

398
00:47:19,381 --> 00:47:22,300
你待得时间太长了
You stayed longer than I thought you would.

399
00:47:25,011 --> 00:47:28,181
该走了
You probably need to move on.

400
00:47:35,438 --> 00:47:37,524
你想我走吗
You want me to leave?

401
00:47:42,862 --> 00:47:43,905
得了吧
Come on.

402
00:47:44,989 --> 00:47:47,325
你可以回雅克恩夫人身边
You could return to Madame Jacquin.

403
00:47:58,628 --> 00:47:59,713
跟我跳一曲
Dance with me.

404
00:48:02,966 --> 00:48:05,051
我老是跟不上节奏
I always end up leading.

405
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:08,013
跟着我  伊维
Well then, lead me, Evie.

406
00:48:26,448 --> 00:48:28,074
你知道
You know...

407
00:48:29,034 --> 00:48:30,160
对我而言
...for me...

408
00:48:30,994 --> 00:48:33,621
你是谁不重要
...it doesn't matter who you are.

409
00:48:34,247 --> 00:48:36,624
我也是这样觉得的
I feel the same.

410
00:48:38,877 --> 00:48:40,503
是吗
Really?

411
00:48:42,589 --> 00:48:45,050
对我而言  我是谁也不重要
It doesn't matter who I am for me, either.

412
00:49:54,411 --> 00:49:55,453
维普
Whip.

413
00:50:02,752 --> 00:50:04,546
我觉得
I just thought I....

414
00:50:06,047 --> 00:50:08,133
我没来过这
I've never been here before.

415
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,593
开什么玩笑
Yeah, no kidding.

416
00:50:12,762 --> 00:50:15,223
明天见
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

417
00:50:15,515 --> 00:50:17,225
玩得开心
Have fun, bro.

418
00:50:29,154 --> 00:50:30,196
那
So....

419
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:33,491
想进去吗
You wanna go inside?

420
00:50:36,995 --> 00:50:39,706
还是你想去哪
Then where would you like to go?

421
00:50:48,131 --> 00:50:52,218
印蒂雅·斯托克  米德本全A生
India Stoker, Middlebend straight-A student...

422
00:50:52,302 --> 00:50:55,764
半夜三更去瑞克斯的停车场
...hanging out in the parking lot at Rockets?

423
00:50:55,847 --> 00:50:58,016
这不是你风格
Doesn't really seem like you.

424
00:50:58,725 --> 00:51:00,852
你不懂
Not that you would know.

425
00:51:02,354 --> 00:51:06,900
是啊  我不懂
Well, I.... I guess you're right. I wouldn't.

426
00:51:07,692 --> 00:51:09,903
就是
It's just that....

427
00:51:09,986 --> 00:51:11,529
是
Yes.

428
00:51:12,405 --> 00:51:14,240
我知道你什么意思
I know what you mean.

429
00:51:15,283 --> 00:51:16,785
是吗
Oh, yeah?

430
00:51:17,744 --> 00:51:19,204
什么意思
How's that?

431
00:51:24,209 --> 00:51:26,378
就像在不知道被拍下来的照片里
Have you ever seen a photograph of yourself...

432
00:51:27,379 --> 00:51:30,882
看到自己
...taken when you didn't know you're being photographed?

433
00:51:32,008 --> 00:51:35,512
看向镜子时看到的天使
From an angle you don't get to see when you look in the mirror.

434
00:51:36,638 --> 00:51:39,265
你就在想  这是我
And you think, "That's me.

435
00:51:40,058 --> 00:51:42,894
那也是我
That's also me."

436
00:51:42,977 --> 00:51:44,437
你
Do you...?

437
00:51:45,105 --> 00:51:47,565
你知道我在说什么吗
Do you know what I'm talking about?

438
00:51:48,983 --> 00:51:52,153
我想我知道
Yeah. I think I do.

439
00:51:58,827 --> 00:52:00,537
好吧
Well...

440
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:03,081
这就是我今夜的感觉
...that's how I feel tonight.

441
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:07,335
你对你自己感到惊讶吗
So you're surprised at yourself?

442
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,973
你不害怕被人碰了
You're not afraid of being touched anymore?

443
00:52:22,183 --> 00:52:24,310
莫负好时光
Please don't spoil it.

444
00:53:11,232 --> 00:53:13,318
操
Holy shit.

445
00:53:13,777 --> 00:53:15,528
大家都说你是个疯子
Everyone said you were crazy.

446
00:53:16,237 --> 00:53:19,032
他们什么都不知道  对吗
But they have no idea, do they?

447
00:53:19,115 --> 00:53:21,284
我要回家了
I wanna go home now.

448
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:23,620
让我走
Let me go.

449
00:53:23,703 --> 00:53:25,163
休想
No, you don't.

450
00:53:25,246 --> 00:53:29,000
你开了这扇门  你就得走过去
You opened this door, and now you're gonna walk through it.

451
00:53:36,424 --> 00:53:38,051
安静点
Quiet.

452
00:53:39,052 --> 00:53:40,887
待在那
Hold still.

453
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:43,306
不疼的
This is not gonna hurt.

454
00:53:44,099 --> 00:53:45,392
操
Shit, what--?

455
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:48,895
停下  停下  停下
Stop, stop, stop.

456
00:53:48,978 --> 00:53:51,147
弄痛我了
I broke my--

457
00:53:51,481 --> 00:53:55,443
庆幸我带了你爸爸的皮带  我的太短了
Glad I borrowed your dad's belt. Mine would've been way too short.

458
00:53:55,527 --> 00:53:58,071
-操  -交给你了
-Shit-- -All yours.

459
00:53:58,154 --> 00:54:01,533
-我受伤了  操  -闭嘴
-I'm seriously hurt. Shit. -Shut up.

460
00:54:24,139 --> 00:54:26,016
印蒂雅  停下
India, stop.

461
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:28,893
印蒂雅
India.

462
00:54:29,769 --> 00:54:31,938
停下  停下
Stop. Stop.

463
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:09,494
我要杀了你
I'll kill you.

464
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:14,249
我不会
I don't give a fuck--

465
00:57:15,477 --> 00:57:17,145
打给我

466
00:59:27,067 --> 00:59:28,693
谁
Yes?

467
00:59:33,698 --> 00:59:35,158
我能进来吗
Can I come in?

468
00:59:38,495 --> 00:59:40,455
现在几点了
Well, what time is it?

469
00:59:55,178 --> 00:59:57,347
帮我梳头
Would you brush my hair?

470
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:01,559
我要睡了
I was just going to bed.

471
01:00:05,063 --> 01:00:07,190
那我帮你梳
Then I'll brush yours.

472
01:00:11,111 --> 01:00:14,114
你穿了我给你买的睡衣
You're wearing the nightgown I bought you.

473
01:00:18,618 --> 01:00:21,996
今夜我感觉像穿了丝绸
Tonight I felt like wearing something silk.

474
01:00:22,539 --> 01:00:26,418
就我有印象以来  我没帮你梳过头
Now that I think about it, I never brushed your hair...

475
01:00:27,085 --> 01:00:28,712
是吧
...did I?

476
01:00:29,045 --> 01:00:30,505
你太忙了
You were busy.

477
01:00:33,758 --> 01:00:34,926
忙什么
With what?

478
01:00:36,094 --> 01:00:37,095
我不知道
I don't know.

479
01:00:37,971 --> 01:00:40,682
你和你爸爸老是去打猎
You and your father were always on your hunting trips.

480
01:00:40,765 --> 01:00:45,562
你们源源不断地带死鸟回来  我怎么处理得完
How could I compete with all of those dead birds you constantly brought home?

481
01:00:59,909 --> 01:01:02,162
今天我看到你在餐厅了
I saw you in the dining room today.

482
01:01:03,621 --> 01:01:05,999
我不知道你怎么想
I don't know what you think you saw...

483
01:01:08,043 --> 01:01:10,253
但是什么都没发生
...but nothing happened.

484
01:01:12,172 --> 01:01:15,717
你走路好轻  我都没听到
You were so still, I never even heard you there.

485
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,094
爸爸教我的
Dad taught me that.

486
01:01:20,013 --> 01:01:21,681
打猎
Hunting.

487
01:01:25,018 --> 01:01:27,103
伺机而动
To wait.

488
01:01:30,273 --> 01:01:32,567
保持安静
<i>In silence.</i>

489
01:01:37,364 --> 01:01:39,908
我们不需要吃饭喝水
<i>We wouldn't need food or drink.</i>

490
01:01:41,076 --> 01:01:43,119
我们能观察一切
<i>We would watch everything.</i>

491
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:47,248
树枝晃动
<i>The patterns of tree branches spreading out...</i>

492
01:01:48,416 --> 01:01:51,795
树影婆娑
<i>...the thousands of shapes clouds make.</i>

493
01:01:52,671 --> 01:01:56,007
我能在五小时内数出树叶的数量
<i>I could count the number of leaves on a tree in five hours.</i>

494
01:02:02,138 --> 01:02:05,308
我一直以为爸爸爱打猎
<i>I always thought Dad liked hunting.</i>

495
01:02:05,558 --> 01:02:07,394
但是今夜我意识到  他是为了我
<i>But tonight I realized he did it for me.</i>

496
01:02:09,938 --> 01:02:12,982
他曾说  有时候你要做点坏事
<i>He used to say, "Sometimes you need to do something bad...</i>

497
01:02:13,066 --> 01:02:16,236
来避免做更坏的事
<i>...to stop you from doing something worse."</i>

498
01:02:33,837 --> 01:02:38,091
明天我要去做头发
Tomorrow, I'm gonna go to the hairdresser...

499
01:02:38,174 --> 01:02:41,344
先要清理你爸爸的工作室
...after I clean out your father's study.

亲爱的印蒂雅  生日快乐
<i>Dear India, happy birthday.</i>

你今天5岁了  我希望我能来你的生日趴
<i>You are 5 years old today. I wish I could be there for your party...</i>

505
01:05:26,134 --> 01:05:29,721
但是叔叔正在非洲给杂志拍照片
<i>...but your uncle is far away in Africa taking pictures for the magazine.</i>

506
01:05:29,804 --> 01:05:32,640
最亲爱的印蒂雅  我现在在佛罗里达给你写信
<i>Dearest India, I'm writing this letter to you from Florence.</i>

507
01:05:32,724 --> 01:05:36,019
昨天我绕着大卫像  他被吊了起来
<i>Yesterday, I circled Michelangelo's David for hours. He carries a sling.</i>

508
01:05:36,102 --> 01:05:38,480
他的束带武器举过左肩
<i>His belted weapon over his left shoulder.</i>

509
01:05:38,563 --> 01:05:41,941
-你是我唯一最亲的侄女  -我安静隐形的伙伴
<i>-You are my dearest and only niece. -My silent and invisible partner.</i>

510
01:05:42,025 --> 01:05:45,070
这是我们共同学习的课程
<i>And these are the lessons for you in our many chapters together.</i>

511
01:05:45,153 --> 01:05:47,030
-亲爱的印蒂雅  -再次生日快乐
<i>-Dear India. -Happy birthday again.</i>

512
01:05:47,113 --> 01:05:49,074
我想念你第一颗牙长出来的时候
<i>I've missed your first teeth coming out.</i>

513
01:05:49,157 --> 01:05:53,703
我看不到你嘴角的酒窝  和他们如何抚养你长大
<i>I'll never see the holes in your smile or how they will fill in as you mature into a young lady.</i>

514
01:05:53,787 --> 01:05:57,874
来自圣埃蒂安的问候  这里的人见面礼都吻双颊
<i>Greetings from Saint-Ètienne, where everyone I meet insists on kissing both cheeks.</i>

515
01:05:57,957 --> 01:06:01,920
-习惯是拥抱和亲吻  -我想你也觉得不舒服
<i>-This custom of hugging and kissing. -I think you, too, would find this uncomfortable.</i>

516
01:06:02,003 --> 01:06:05,006
如果我发现是拥抱你  也许会破个例
<i>If I found it was you in an embrace, I could make an exception.</i>

517
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:07,467
-你会吗  -情人节快乐
<i>-I wonder if you would, too. -Happy Valentine's.</i>

或者是我听的音乐里
<i>Or in the music I hear.</i>

521
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:18,186
流落他乡一个孤独男人的呓语
<i>It is a whistling tune from a lonely man wandering in a foreign land.</i>

522
01:06:18,269 --> 01:06:21,314
事物发展到鼎盛时  我能强烈地感觉到
<i>I sense things so acutely until it becomes almost too much.</i>

523
01:06:21,398 --> 01:06:23,942
不知道你是否也一样  人生艰难
<i>I wonder if for you, too, life is made difficult by--</i>

524
01:06:24,025 --> 01:06:28,071
你能听到别人听不到的  看到别人看不到的
<i>The fact that you can hear what others cannot hear, see what they cannot see.</i>

525
01:06:28,154 --> 01:06:31,616
我知道有一天你会与众不同  印蒂雅  你已经是了
<i>I know that someday you'll be very special, India, and you already are.</i>

526
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:35,120

<i>-I know inside you feel some loneliness. -Because you are the only one.</i>

530

你好
<i>Hello?</i>

540
01:08:45,208 --> 01:08:49,045
我爸爸有一样的太阳镜
My father had the exact same sunglasses.

541
01:08:54,509 --> 01:08:58,930
但只有开车时才带  一般放在车内储物箱里
He wore them only when he was driving so they were always in the glove compartment.

542
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:04,310
我以为连着车子一起融化了
Now I suppose they're all melted up, along with the rest of the car.

543
01:09:05,103 --> 01:09:07,355
妈妈醒来前请离开

01:09:14,487 --> 01:09:16,948
我很好奇乔纳森发生了什么
I'm curious about what happened to Jonathan.

546
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:25,832
这是理查德事件不可分的一个环节
<i>That's an inseparable part of what happened to Richard.</i>

547
01:09:25,915 --> 01:09:30,211
理查德总是带着乔纳森玩
<i>Richard was completely taken with Jonathan.</i>

548
01:09:30,295 --> 01:09:34,966
那年夏天  乔纳森刚学会爬楼梯
<i>That summer, Jonathan had just learned how to climb the stairs.</i>

549
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:36,634
再来一次
<i>Let's go again. Let's go.</i>

550
01:09:36,718 --> 01:09:40,472
每碰到梯子都要爬
<i>He couldn't resist climbing any staircase he came across.</i>

551
01:10:53,878 --> 01:10:58,133
您的家人捐献这座房子给克劳福德已经20年了
<i>It's been 20 years since your family donated this building to Crawford.</i>

552
01:10:58,216 --> 01:11:02,012
可能看上去很旧  可是查理的房间很舒适
It may look old now, but Charlie's room is still very comfortable.

553
01:11:02,721 --> 01:11:05,932
你也知道  他想待在这
As you know, he was the one who wanted to stay here.

554
01:11:06,016 --> 01:11:09,394
他坚持在今天离开
And he insisted on being discharged on this day.

555
01:11:09,477 --> 01:11:11,062
今天
Today.

556
01:11:12,689 --> 01:11:13,773
欢迎来我家
Welcome to my home.

557
01:11:16,901 --> 01:11:19,029
离家在外的家
Away from home.

558
01:11:35,587 --> 01:11:37,714
我们再次见面的时候
Until we meet again.

559
01:11:47,807 --> 01:11:49,351
我为你骄傲
I'm so proud of you.

560
01:12:25,178 --> 01:12:28,014
这是你最爱的车
It always was your favorite car.

561
01:12:31,601 --> 01:12:34,938
我想你会喜欢纽约
I think you're gonna love New York.

562
01:12:35,605 --> 01:12:37,232
我为你置办了一所公寓
I got you your own apartment.

563
01:12:39,609 --> 01:12:41,111
看
You see?

564
01:12:42,445 --> 01:12:44,698
我们不回你家吗
Aren't we going to your house?

565
01:12:45,657 --> 01:12:47,992
你需要的都在这
Everything you need is in here.

566
01:12:50,286 --> 01:12:52,038
我们为什么不回你家
Why aren't we going to your place?

567
01:12:56,501 --> 01:12:57,919
我不能去见印蒂雅吗
I'm not gonna see India?

568
01:12:58,003 --> 01:12:59,170
钥匙
Here are the keys.

569
01:12:59,254 --> 01:13:01,965
一切都办妥了
I think you'll see that I've taken care of all the details.

570
01:13:03,091 --> 01:13:04,384
干嘛这样对我
<i>Why are you doing this to me?</i>

571
01:13:04,467 --> 01:13:08,555
真要我把你知道的事情再说一遍
Do I really have to tell you something you already know?

572
01:13:08,888 --> 01:13:10,724
为什么我不能去
Why can't I go?

573
01:13:10,807 --> 01:13:12,767
查理
Charlie.

574
01:13:12,851 --> 01:13:14,394
为什么
Why not?

575
01:13:19,691 --> 01:13:21,359
告诉我
Tell me.

576
01:13:23,862 --> 01:13:25,113
你听好了
You listen very carefully.

577
01:13:25,196 --> 01:13:27,449
这很重要
This is the most important thing.

578
01:13:28,116 --> 01:13:32,495
-发生任何事  你打电话  -你还是爱我的
-If anything happens, you must call-- -You still love me, don't you, Richie?

579
01:13:34,372 --> 01:13:37,959
当然  我爱你  查理
Yes, of course, I love you, Charlie.

580
01:13:40,587 --> 01:13:45,258
现在我只能爱你少一点了  我不能让你
I just have to love you a little less now. I can't have you--

581
01:13:45,342 --> 01:13:48,970
接近印蒂雅  接近我的家人
Near my India, my family.

582
01:13:49,054 --> 01:13:50,221
我说
And I said:

583
01:13:50,889 --> 01:13:53,058
但是我也是家人
But I'm your family.

584
01:13:55,143 --> 01:13:58,229
不能带回家的家人算哪门子家人
What kind of family is family you can't take home?

585
01:13:58,938 --> 01:14:01,149
-老天  -抱歉
-Jesus. -Excuse me.

586
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,945
老天  查理
Jesus, Charlie.

587
01:14:30,887 --> 01:14:32,555
你还好吗
Are you okay?

588
01:14:33,932 --> 01:14:36,059
我没事  理查
<i>I'm fine, Richie.</i>

589
01:14:37,477 --> 01:14:38,770
我没事了
<i>I'm fine now.</i>

590
01:14:40,897 --> 01:14:42,315
谢谢关心
Thank you for asking.

591
01:14:58,415 --> 01:14:59,457
查理
Charlie?

592
01:15:03,003 --> 01:15:04,004
查理
Oh, Charlie.

593
01:15:16,933 --> 01:15:19,811
当然我还爱你  理查德
Of course, I still love you, Richard.

594
01:15:21,021 --> 01:15:24,315
现在我也只能爱你少一点了
I just have to love you a little bit less now.

595
01:15:39,998 --> 01:15:41,875
为什么是现在
<i>Why now?</i>

596
01:15:44,002 --> 01:15:45,253
为什么现在回来
Why come back now?

597
01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:56,431
我离开克劳福德的那天
The day I left Crawford...

598
01:15:56,931 --> 01:15:58,892
你爸爸发生意外的那天
...the day your father had his accident...

599
01:15:59,559 --> 01:16:01,978
是什么日子  你记得吗
...what day was it, do you remember?

600
01:16:02,062 --> 01:16:03,730
是
Yes.

601
01:16:05,273 --> 01:16:07,025
我记得
I remember.

602
01:16:07,567 --> 01:16:08,985
什么日子
What day was it?

603
01:16:11,404 --> 01:16:14,115
我18岁生日
It was my 18th birthday.

604
01:16:23,917 --> 01:16:25,085
我一直在等待
I was waiting.

605
01:16:26,211 --> 01:16:27,962
为了你
For you.

606
01:16:28,338 --> 01:16:29,798
我做的一切
Everything I've ever done.

607
01:16:31,925 --> 01:16:33,385
都是为了你  印蒂雅
For you, India.

608
01:18:05,435 --> 01:18:07,896
生日快乐  印蒂雅
Happy birthday, India.

609
01:18:16,071 --> 01:18:17,739
警长
Yes, sheriff.

610
01:18:17,822 --> 01:18:21,576
我饿了  就去瑞克斯买炸薯条
I was hungry, so I stopped by Rockets for some fries.

611
01:18:21,659 --> 01:18:26,581
我在停车场碰到维普  就去散散步
I bumped into Whip at the parking lot and we decided to go for a walk.

612
01:18:26,664 --> 01:18:29,709
晚上  树林里很危险
At night? Those woods are dangerous.

613
01:18:29,793 --> 01:18:32,045
我不怕
Oh, I wasn't scared.

614
01:18:32,128 --> 01:18:34,047
和维普在一起我不怕
Not with Whip there.

615
01:18:35,006 --> 01:18:37,008
他很强壮
He's so strong.

616
01:18:38,134 --> 01:18:39,511
是啊
I see.

617
01:18:41,513 --> 01:18:46,184
我们过得很愉快
So we had a very nice time.

618
01:18:49,562 --> 01:18:51,022
然后呢
And then?

619
01:18:51,481 --> 01:18:54,109
然后我回家了
And then I went home.

620
01:18:54,984 --> 01:18:57,445
维普说他也回家了
I thought Whip said he was heading home too.

621
01:18:57,529 --> 01:19:00,031
记得几点吗
Any idea what time that was?

622
01:19:00,490 --> 01:19:02,617
大概
Well, that was....

623
01:19:04,077 --> 01:19:06,079
你什么时候吃薯条的
When did you eat the fries?

624
01:19:08,081 --> 01:19:09,082
什么
Excuse me?

625
01:19:09,165 --> 01:19:12,419
你说你去那因为饿了
Well, you said you went there because you were hungry?

626
01:19:12,502 --> 01:19:19,175
共度美好时光以后  你更饿了
And then, that is, after having a nice time, you would have become even more hungry...

627
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:22,929
如果你去吃薯条
...and if you went to eat some fries...

628
01:19:23,013 --> 01:19:27,017
我也许能找到那会见过你的人
...I could find some people that can remember what time they saw you.

629
01:19:28,226 --> 01:19:29,894
大概
I think I--

630
01:19:30,186 --> 01:19:32,022
大概是
I think I must have been--

631
01:19:32,105 --> 01:19:33,898
我肯定脸色发白
I must have been blushing.

632
01:19:33,982 --> 01:19:36,985
因为是第一次和男孩子出去
It was my first time outside with a boy.

633
01:19:37,068 --> 01:19:39,487
所以不想被看到
I didn't want to be seen.

634
01:19:39,571 --> 01:19:41,865
你回家时是8点半
It was 8:30 when you came home.

635
01:19:41,948 --> 01:19:45,076
PBS正在放游唱诗人
<i>II Trovatore </i>was playing on PBS.

636
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:48,955
是的  我回家时我叔叔在看电视
Yeah, when I came home, my uncle was watching T.V...

637
01:19:49,039 --> 01:19:51,207
我就和他一起看
...so l watched it with him.

638
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:53,710
等等
Just one moment.

639
01:19:53,793 --> 01:19:58,298
游唱诗人
<i>II Trovatore.</i>

640
01:19:58,381 --> 01:20:00,967
那是什么  外国片
What is it? It's a foreign movie?

641
01:20:01,051 --> 01:20:04,346
不是  威尔第的一出歌剧
No. No, it's an opera by Verdi.

642
01:20:04,763 --> 01:20:07,515
-要我帮你写吗  -不用
-Would you like me to write it down? -I'm fine.

643
01:20:08,516 --> 01:20:10,143
希望维普没事
I do hope Whip's okay.

644
01:20:10,226 --> 01:20:12,312
他家人都急死了
Well, his folks are a mess.

645
01:20:12,395 --> 01:20:16,816
不过我感觉他会回来的
Then again, I have a feeling that he'll turn up.

646
01:20:17,067 --> 01:20:18,985
那个年纪的男孩子
Boys that age....

647
01:20:19,611 --> 01:20:20,987
你也知道是什么样
Well, you know how they are.

648
01:20:21,071 --> 01:20:23,156
我了解
I'm sure I do.

649
01:20:23,239 --> 01:20:25,909
要是您听说了什么麻烦告诉我
You will let me know if you hear anything, won't you?

650
01:20:25,992 --> 01:20:27,285
好的
Will do.

651
01:20:28,119 --> 01:20:29,996
好的
Okay.

652
01:20:30,413 --> 01:20:32,624
保持联系
Well, I'll be in touch.

653
01:20:32,707 --> 01:20:33,875
再会  警长
Goodbye, sheriff.

654
01:20:33,958 --> 01:20:35,835
再会  警长
Goodbye, sheriff.

655
01:20:43,718 --> 01:20:49,391
你家管家离开后还有联系吗
Oh, by the way, did your housekeeper ever get in touch after leaving town so quick?

656
01:20:53,103 --> 01:20:54,646
没
No.

657
01:20:55,689 --> 01:20:57,232
没有
She didn't.

658
01:20:57,774 --> 01:21:02,779
就这么消失了真奇怪
Strange how people can just disappear on you.

659
01:21:15,542 --> 01:21:17,377
他还会来的
He'll be back.

660
01:21:20,171 --> 01:21:22,215
我们怎么办
What are we going to do?

661
01:21:23,717 --> 01:21:29,180
现在我想可以去纽约了
I think we'll really love New York.

662
01:21:37,605 --> 01:21:39,566
什么时候
When do we leave?

663
01:22:00,045 --> 01:22:01,963
打扰
I'm sorry.

664
01:22:09,095 --> 01:22:10,680
明晚
Tomorrow night.

665
01:23:29,676 --> 01:23:34,139
-再做一次吗  -我饿了  先吃点东西
-Should we do it again? -I'm hungry. Let's eat first.

666
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:48,570
我总是在想为什么要那么早要孩子
You know, I've often wondered why it is we have children in the first place.

667
01:23:50,113 --> 01:23:53,491
最后得出的结论是
And the conclusion I've come to is...

668
01:23:55,910 --> 01:24:00,749
在某个时间节点上  我们意识到
...at some point in our lives, we realize things are....

669
01:24:00,832 --> 01:24:03,710
我们的关系无法修复了
They're screwed up beyond repair.

670
01:24:05,503 --> 01:24:08,381
所以要重新开始
So we decide to start again.

671
01:24:09,549 --> 01:24:12,010
把过去恩怨一笔勾销
Wipe the slate clean.

672
01:24:13,136 --> 01:24:14,971
重新开始
Start afresh.

673
01:24:18,141 --> 01:24:20,226
所以我们要了孩子
And we have children.

674
01:24:21,853 --> 01:24:27,067
书上这样说  你会做我不能做的
Little carbon copies we can turn to and say, "You will do what I could not.

675
01:24:28,068 --> 01:24:31,780
你成功了在我失败之处
You will succeed where I have failed."

676
01:24:34,074 --> 01:24:37,911
因为我们这次希望有个人是正确的
Because we want someone to get it right this time.

677
01:24:45,085 --> 01:24:47,212
但是不是我
But not me.

678
01:24:52,050 --> 01:24:57,722
就个人而言  我等不及看生活把你撕碎
Personally speaking, I can't wait to watch life tear you apart.

679
01:25:07,732 --> 01:25:09,484
印蒂雅
India...

680
01:25:13,279 --> 01:25:15,156
你到底是谁
...who are you?

681
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:21,705
你应该爱我的  不是吗
You were supposed to love me, weren't you?

682
01:25:46,896 --> 01:25:48,857
来我房里一下
Come up to my room, please.

683
01:25:51,026 --> 01:25:53,570
感谢你的演出
I enjoyed your performance.

684
01:26:00,285 --> 01:26:03,121
印蒂雅  去收拾个小包
India, go and pack a small bag.

685
01:26:03,204 --> 01:26:05,999
待会就走
