1
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,337
When everybody leaves you lonely

2
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:51,091
And times are worse than sad

3
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:59,058
And the world is falling on your head

4
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:04,021
Just remember, for all you know

5
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,441
Good or bad, come what may

6
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,904
You're gonna live tomorrow

7
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:17,242
If you don't die today

8
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:20,788
It takes a muscle to fall in love

9
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:25,167
It takes a muscle to fall in love

10
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:29,171
It takes a muscle to fall in love

11
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,467
Now the fear got in me...?

12
00:01:56,991 --> 00:02:00,369
Your mother said you were having a hard time.

13
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:03,747
Yeah, I... I just broke up with my girlfriend.

14
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,752
We went out from the end of high school till... well, through college.

15
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,921
What did she do?

16
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:16,385
She studied Marketing at school. She's got a job at an ad agency now.

17
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,762
And you?

18
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,431
Me? I... I studied Neuroscience...

19
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,768
with a primary focus on the relationship between the eye and the brain.

20
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,104
My thesis project was about peripheral vision.

21
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,773
It dealt with something called 'crowding' and 'size pooling'.

22
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,942
How the width of one object

23
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:35,070
is given a weighted average of the objects around it.

24
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,448
The effect is called 'size pooling'.

25
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,785
- It was published, actually. - That's great.

26
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,414
I'm not sure I understand, but it's great you were published.

27
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,958
Yeah, that's OK, nobody does.

28
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,838
How long were you together?

29
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,884
For almost 5 years.

30
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,636
I moved in with her right after graduation.

31
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,471
Things were...

32
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,599
Well, they were nice for a while,

33
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:07,644
but then she wasn't happy anymore... or I wasn't making her happy.

34
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,521
She didn't like what she was doing.

35
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:13,150
I tried to be supportive, encourage her not to settle. But then...

36
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,029
I'm living at home now.

37
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:25,662
Excuse me. I'm not feeling so well. I'm still feeling jetlagged.

38
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,540
Do you understand "jetlagged?"

39
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,375
Yeah. Don't worry.

40
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,546
Do you still speak to each other?

41
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,675
No. Not really.

42
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,261
The way that it ended...

43
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,348
She started coming home late from work...

44
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,516
and one night she got into bed with me

45
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,186
and I moved to hold her, and I just...

46
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:53,148
smelled this smell on her.

47
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,900
What do you mean?

48
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,489
I'm sorry. Maybe it's a little inappropriate.

49
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,324
No. Go ahead.

50
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,160
I...

51
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,413
I just smelled this guy on her.

52
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:11,250
She smelled like sex.

53
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,043
Like sweat and latex.

54
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:17,339
And this guy, whoever he was, was all over her.

55
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,762
I mean, she denied it, of course,

56
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,514
but it was clear.

57
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,269
I don't know, maybe I overreacted.

58
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,856
Well, whatever. She's a whore.

59
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,903
I'd like to meet somebody new.

60
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,870
Hello?

61
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,248
OK, thanks, I'll be right down.

62
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,958
My cab is downstairs.

63
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,961
- Can I help you with your bags? - No. Thank you.

64
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,881
So, you know where everything is.

65
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:03,093
Just change the sheets at the end...

66
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,054
make sure the heater is off and the kitchen is clean.

67
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,391
Yeah... yeah. And how long will you be away?

68
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:14,104
I'm going to the south. So maybe a week, maybe a month.

69
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,273
I don't know, it depends.

70
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,942
But you'll be here for a week? Or much longer?

71
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:22,362
No. Just a week. I have to figure out where I'm going to next.

72
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,323
Oh, right.

73
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,075
Leave the key under the mat outside.

74
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,286
I'm sorry I have to leave just when you arrive.

75
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,830
That's OK. Don't worry.

76
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,666
- Have a safe trip. - Thank you.

77
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,920
- Give my love to your mom. - I will... I will.

78
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,715
- Goodbye. - Ciao.

79
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:10,327
If the walls were too thin, you would...?

80
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,620
'Hey, Chelle belle...

81
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,583
"Dear Michelle..."

82
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,420
'Hey, Michelle... How are you?

83
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,922
'How's everything?

84
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,592
'I know you said not to contact you.

85
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,440
'I know, the last time we spoke, we agreed not to contact each other.

86
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:55,515
'But I'm in Paris now, about to start traveling around for a few months.

87
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,767
'And since we always spoke about coming here together,

88
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,729
'I just thought I'd let you know. Things are great.

89
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,023
'So far, things are great.

90
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,234
'I'm spending time with our cousin Carlo and his friends.

91
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,029
'I... I met someone, actually.

92
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,781
'I wanted to tell you I'd met someone.

93
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:16,411
'I'm meeting some interesting people here and practicing my French.

94
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,246
'I miss you.

95
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,459
'I hope you're well and maybe we can speak soon?

96
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,336
'Maybe we can speak soon...

97
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,337
'Love...

98
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,717
'Yours... sincerely.

99
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,178
'Sincerely, Si.'

100
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,679
Cunt!

101
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,855
There was a time...?

102
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:22,060
Heaven has reached down to earth.

103
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,481
And what does this tell us?

104
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,235
That God has not forsaken us.

105
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,697
That He is always watching over us.

106
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,657
That He loves us.

107
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,995
Through this sign, He has manifested His presence.

108
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,581
He is telling us.

109
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,000
You are not alone.

110
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,391
Excuse me.

111
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:06,813
Excuse me... Could I have a light, please?

112
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,064
Yeah.

113
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,323
Thanks, you're very nice.

114
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,413
- OK? - Yeah.

115
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,332
Yeah, thanks.

116
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,169
- Are you taking the Métro? - Of course.

117
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,008
Do you...?

118
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:39,763
- Do you both live in Paris, or not? - We actually live nearby.

119
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:45,060
I'm sorry but... What did you say?

120
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,480
We live right around here... in this neighborhood.

121
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:51,066
Yes, OK, I understand.

122
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:58,031
Me, I stay here for a few days but...

123
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,576
then I leave soon for...

124
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,995
I'm going...

125
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,748
In fact, I leave...

126
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,458
East, maybe...

127
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:13,088
I'm sorry about my French. It's awful, I know.

128
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,048
It's OK, don't worry.

129
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,093
- What's your name? - What?

130
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,012
- What? - Your name?

131
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,016
Got a problem?

132
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,102
What?

133
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,479
Don't you say excuse me?

134
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,523
He's not French...

135
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:32,732
No, I...

136
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,609
I'm sorry, sir.

137
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,403
So he doesn't speak French?

138
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,447
OK. So I'm apologize man.

139
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,616
- OK... - OK?

140
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,034
No regret.

141
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,078
OK, yeah. I'm sorry.

142
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:48,873
You have tiny hands, man. Like a girl.

143
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,417
OK...

144
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,003
And why do you have two girls and I have none?

145
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,672
OK, that's it, enough.

146
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,091
- Look, man, I'm sorry... - Hold on!

147
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,634
Why did you hide these sweethearts?

148
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,840
- Please let go of me, sir! - Are you laughing at me?

149
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,972
No! I am not fucking laughing at you!

150
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,143
Damn it!

151
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:14,566
- Sorry. - No, it's OK.

152
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,818
Do you know what time it is?

153
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,112
It's 10:05.

154
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,157
We don't have time?

155
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,286
Not much. No.

156
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,913
I'm hungry.

157
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,545
It was nice meeting you guys.

158
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:36,796
- Bye. - Bye.

159
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,174
- See you around, maybe? - Nice meeting you.

160
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:13,208
Do you like natural woman?

161
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,959
Fuck me...

162
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,670
I'm very horny.

163
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,299
Please write me what you like.

164
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,512
Can you hear me now?

165
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,141
Fuck...

166
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:35,480
Fuck me in the ass Fuck me in my ass.

167
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,399
Oh, yeah...

168
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,945
Fuck me, babe.

169
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:48,326
So hot ass for you.

170
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,662
Yeah...

171
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,126
Fuck me in the face.

172
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:01,339
Fuck me in the face. Fuck my face.

173
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,552
Fuck me in the face.

174
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,103
Fuck me...

175
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:23,528
Fuck me... Fuck... Fuck me...

176
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,243
Fuck me...

177
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:49,721
Fuck me bad... Fuck me...

178
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,600
Fuck me...

179
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,604
Did you come?

180
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,772
Yeah? Did you come?

181
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,109
Come back for me, love.

182
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,914
You are welcome, buddy.

183
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,166
Thank you, too.

184
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,074
'Hi, Michelle.

185
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,117
'I haven't heard back from you in a while.

186
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,995
'Not sure if you're getting my emails or if you're ignoring me.

187
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:59,707
'I just wanted to see how you were. You could at least get back to me.

188
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,460
'There's nothing I could possibly do from here.

189
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:05,797
'I'm sending you my best. Simon.'

190
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,515
Evening, sir. Excuse me, good evening.

191
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,475
You speak English?

192
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:18,643
- Yeah? - Yeah.

193
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,896
One minute... Do you wanna see French pussy? Lap dance? Strip club?

194
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,357
- No, that's OK, thanks. - Come on, my buddy...

195
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,467
My friend...

196
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,678
Wanna spend the evening with some pretty girls?

197
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:54,929
What?

198
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,724
A nice night with pretty girls. Interested?

199
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,308
Right over there.

200
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,146
What do you mean exactly?

201
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,190
You go in, have a drink, look around...

202
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,609
There are pretty girls to keep you company.

203
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:12,196
And if you want more, if you want sex, that's possible too, OK?

204
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,574
How much is it?

205
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,701
10 Euros for a drink...

206
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,953
If you don't like it, you can leave.

207
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,123
What do you think? It's a great souvenir of Paris.

208
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,250
Trust me, I'm not a crook.

209
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,257
Over there?

210
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:47,815
Good evening.

211
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,443
- Good evening. - Good evening.

212
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,327
- Hi. - What's your name?

213
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,412
My name's Simon.

214
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,372
- Sabrina, nice to meet you. - You too.

215
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,917
Will you have a drink with me?

216
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,794
Yeah, but how much will that be?

217
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,712
- 20 Euros. - 20?

218
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,090
Thank you.

219
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,133
Where are you from?

220
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,219
New York.

221
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,472
- New York City... - Yeah.

222
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,141
I don't speak very well, English.

223
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,478
I present my friend, it's no problem for you?

224
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,980
- OK, sure. - Victoria, come here.

225
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,358
- This is my friend Victoria. - Hi.

226
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,151
Are you all set? No problem?

227
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:35,113
- Sure. - OK, it's very good.

228
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,700
I go in the bathroom and I come back, OK?

229
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,577
- OK. - Bye.

230
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,874
- Thank you. - You want to go in the back?

231
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:50,044
- How much is that? - It's free.

232
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,338
We just sit there, and that's all.

233
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,257
- Yeah, OK. - Come on.

234
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,487
You're very handsome.

235
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,952
I'm not saying that just for work, I really think so.

236
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,164
That's sweet. Thank you.

237
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,554
See this girl?

238
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,265
- Sabrina? - The one I was talking to...

239
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:48,019
This girl, she doesn't need money - she wants money!

240
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:52,773
Today she got three clients and I only got one.

241
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,569
Normally, it's a trade, you know?

242
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,906
If she has one client, I get the next one...

243
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,242
and she gets the next one, and it's a deal.

244
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:09,248
I treat her like a sister. If I have food, I share my food with her.

245
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,876
If she's happy, I'm happy for her.

246
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,796
But for her it's not about sharing.

247
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:21,135
- And me? I need this money. - Yeah, I understand.

248
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,059
So you're visiting Paris?

249
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,810
Yeah. Yeah...

250
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,396
- And you have a girlfriend? - No.

251
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,690
What do you do?

252
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:39,612
For now? Nothing. I just finished school.

253
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,075
I don't see you very well.

254
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,078
I need to look at you closer.

255
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,872
I have myopia.

256
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,749
Yeah?

257
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:55,461
I studied eyes in college.

258
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,464
- Really? - Yes.

259
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:04,679
I studied the relationship between the brain and the eye.

260
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:08,140
- You speak French very well. - No, that's not true.

261
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:12,103
- Yes, you do. - I studied in high school, but it's bad.

262
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,901
Do you want to make love?

263
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,864
How much is that?

264
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,660
If you say 150, I say OK.

265
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:33,124
Some girls say "It's the price" and they won't go down... 200.

266
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:37,128
With me, I can go down for 150.

267
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,921
- 150...? - Yeah.

268
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:42,216
I give half to my boss. If I make 50, I give him 25.

269
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,426
OK.

270
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,052
But...

271
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:50,933
with you, it's not like sleeping with an old fat, ugly man. You know?

272
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,811
With you, I will like it.

273
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,397
I...

274
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,069
I spent all my money at the bar. I only have a credit card.

275
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,865
- You have a credit card? - Yeah.

276
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,576
That's OK. You can give it to me.

277
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,121
OK.

278
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,339
Thank you.

279
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,054
Nadia?

280
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,947
Sorry.

281
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,616
That's OK.

282
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,659
I have a scar.

283
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,496
A scarf?

284
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:57,625
No, a scar. S-C-A-R... 'scar'.

285
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,127
Here, you know.

286
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,421
- That's OK. - I just prefer to tell you.

287
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:06,092
I prefer to say it before to people.

288
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,360
How are you feeling?

289
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:26,904
I feel good.

290
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,235
Can I...

291
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,362
Can I just look at you?

292
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:09,530
Yes.

293
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:14,994
- This is the scar. - It's OK.

294
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,459
Can you turn around, please?

295
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,420
Jesus!

296
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:08,506
Oh, Jesus Christ!

297
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,800
Fuck...

298
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:17,515
- I'm sorry. - It's OK.

299
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,308
I didn't wanna come.

300
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,936
It's OK. As long as you're happy.

301
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,483
Yeah... I'm happy. I'm happy.

302
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,796
Thank you.

303
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,786
Are you OK?

304
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,205
- And you? - Yeah.

305
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,549
What is that?

306
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:40,764
It's a fox. My mother gave it to me.

307
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,982
Look.

308
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,280
Here.

309
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,160
- It's a mess. - No... it's OK.

310
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,911
Hold on...

311
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,581
I have to take it off.

312
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,252
It's better off.

313
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,342
Take my number, if you like.

314
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:21,055
Take my number, so we can see each other outside.

315
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:24,141
It's the same price, but it's better.

316
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,602
OK.

317
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,556
I miss her.

318
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,977
'I know, honey.

319
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,439
'It's OK now. It's gonna get better.'

320
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,858
Yeah.

321
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,495
'Have you talked to her?

322
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,422
'Si?

323
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,636
'Si, can you look at me?

324
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,515
'Hello? Hello!'

325
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,352
No. I haven't talked to her.

326
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,314
'Well, I don't get that.

327
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,734
'If you still wanna make this work,

328
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,111
'maybe you should call her.'

329
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,238
Hh. I don't know.

330
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,199
Yeah, I guess.

331
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,244
I wasn't good to her.

332
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,499
'That's ridiculous.

333
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,710
'Everything you did for her...

334
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,588
'Look, do you still wanna be with her?'

335
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:22,009
I don't know.

336
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,098
'Go meet a French girl.

337
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,602
'Meet an Italian girl. Meet somebody.

338
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:34,146
'Just stop being miserable.

339
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,273
'It's not healthy.'

340
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,405
'Si?'

341
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,884
I'm not your girlfriend, you can say what you want.

342
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:06,553
Yeah?

343
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,097
OK.

344
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:16,855
- Say, "Fuck me." - Fuck me.

345
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:22,528
Say, "Fuck me."

346
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,572
Fuck me.

347
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:46,927
'Hey, Simon. I'm happy to hear

348
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,096
"'you've been traveling and doing well."

349
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,682
'I've been hesitant to write back to you because the way we left it.

350
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,226
'I thought it would be better for us to take some time apart,

351
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,019
'in every sense of the word.

352
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:58,105
'I don't know when you're coming back to the city.

353
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:01,567
'But when you do, please respect me and my space.

354
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:05,195
The truth is that I don't think I know you, or that I'll ever really know you.

355
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:07,573
'I don't think you ever knew me.

356
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,534
'I've come to realize that in the past few months.

357
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,994
'I'm happy now.

358
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,288
'The last time we saw each other, you frightened me

359
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,915
'and I don't feel comfortable being around you any more.

360
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:20,544
'I wish you all the best. Sincerely, Michelle.'

361
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,614
Really? I missed a party?

362
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,325
No, it was great. I had it all to myself.

363
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,619
What, like I don't need cash?

364
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,080
Hi, girls!

365
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,415
- How's it going? - Everybody's here.

366
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,710
Where else would we be?

367
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,629
Want a drag?

368
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,509
Why you staring?

369
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:36,013
You got a problem?

370
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,640
I was attacked in the street. Can I come in?

371
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,777
Who did this to you?

372
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:36,448
I was... I was attacked. These kids, they took all my stuff.

373
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,284
Where?

374
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,620
At this train station.

375
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,208
I'm sorry.

376
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:49,211
What do you want me to do? I'm working now.

377
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,629
I...

378
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,589
You don't have any friends?

379
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,300
No, I...

380
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,928
I just needed some help

381
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,430
and I didn't know where else to go.

382
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,729
Do you think I could just stay with you for a few minutes?

383
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,397
No, not now.

384
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:17,823
OK...

385
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:38,510
If you want, we can meet in 2 hours

386
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:41,054
in the bar called Le Café au Rendezvous.

387
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,890
On the left, at the corner.

388
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:45,851
It's OK?

389
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:50,772
Wh-when will you be there?

390
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,816
When I finish work.

391
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:55,652
In two hours.

392
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,655
OK.

393
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,702
- Are you OK? - Yeah, I'm fine.

394
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,356
So, where do you live?

395
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:36,109
I... I don't.

396
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,236
You don't know where you live?

397
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,323
No... I was supposed to leave.

398
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,826
- What? - I was supposed to leave tonight.

399
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:54,586
And now you don't have a place to stay.

400
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,296
No.

401
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:58,590
Not for now.

402
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:07,474
OK. So... do you wanna stay at my place?

403
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,978
Is that OK?

404
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:19,653
- Let's go. Should I pay for this? - Yeah, thanks. Thank you.

405
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,163
Sit over there.

406
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:43,093
- You have a nice place. - I rent it from an old lady.

407
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,887
She's a bit lonely.

408
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,688
Your parents...

409
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,608
you can't call them for help?

410
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:01,152
I don't really talk to my parents any more.

411
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:04,781
But I'll try and figure something out tomorrow.

412
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,872
Thank you.

413
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:37,105
Fuck... It stings.

414
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,500
- That it? - Yes.

415
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,843
Do you have any other wounds?

416
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:09,763
I'm sorry, what?

417
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,514
Where...

418
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,392
where else did they hurt you?

419
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:20,482
I don't know. I'm not... I'm not sure.

420
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:26,780
Let me see.

421
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,770
What do you want?

422
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:02,399
I can't sleep.

423
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:06,069
Could you talk to me for a few minutes?

424
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,363
About what?

425
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,288
I don't know.

426
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,791
Anything.

427
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:26,923
Is Victoria your real name?

428
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,807
My name is Noura.

429
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,395
- Nora? - Noura...

430
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,313
Noura.

431
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:50,363
How long have you worked at the bar?

432
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,408
A few months.

433
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,831
What did you do before?

434
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:05,837
I was working in a supermarket outside Paris.

435
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:08,673
Is that where you're from?

436
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,135
Yeah.

437
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:15,763
I lived there until I...

438
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,765
I was divorced.

439
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,480
You were married?

440
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,029
Was it bad?

441
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,663
He was very violent.

442
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:46,711
He never let me go out.

443
00:41:57,264 --> 00:42:00,183
Once, I woke up in the middle of the night.

444
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:04,687
I was pregnant.

445
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:09,609
I had a baby boy inside me.

446
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,361
My belly was so big.

447
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,280
I woke up suddenly...

448
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,286
and there was blood everywhere.

449
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:27,252
And I walked into the kitchen.

450
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:32,840
And my husband was there. He looked at me.

451
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:36,803
I was covered in blood, it was everywhere.

452
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,389
And before going to the hospital...

453
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:43,393
he fucked me in the kitchen.

454
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,615
Did you understand what I just said?

455
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:02,036
I think so, yeah. You have a son.

456
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,136
Thanks for being so nice to me.

457
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:13,775
'Hey, Mom. I'm in Prague and about to head to Sarajevo.

458
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,944
'I'm sorry I've been out of touch, my reception's awful out here.

459
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:20,490
'I'm feeling better than I have in a long time, so don't worry about me.

460
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:23,284
'I met somebody, by the way. I think you'd like her.

461
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,411
'She's not a bitch..

462
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,455
'When I get back, I really wanna focus again

463
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:30,875
'and not be such a pain to you and Dad, moping around the house all the time.

464
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:34,337
'I feel good being out here and it was worth taking this trip.

465
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:37,924
'I think you'll be surprised by how focused I am when I get back.

466
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,635
'I love you. Send my best to Dad.

467
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:43,262
'Love... your fox, Si.'

468
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:48,518
- Are you there? - Yeah.

469
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:54,065
- Hey, how are you? - Bad day.

470
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,275
What happened?

471
00:44:57,736 --> 00:45:00,154
I saw a client at a hotel.

472
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:02,907
Very aggressive.

473
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,118
But he left me some coke.

474
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:08,287
Want a glass of wine?

475
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:11,791
Yeah, sure. That'd be nice.

476
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:40,570
You know...

477
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:44,574
the night I came into the bar to say goodbye

478
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,118
and I saw you with that other guy?

479
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:55,001
I know that I shouldn't have felt this way,

480
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:58,296
but it made me feel really weird.

481
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,381
Does it make you feel weird?

482
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,094
I was working.

483
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:10,641
Do you think people do what they do just because they like it

484
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,643
and not because they have to?

485
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:21,194
You know, most of these guys...

486
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:27,742
If they would get hit by a car, I would not even care.

487
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:35,124
W-w-what about their wives?

488
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:38,169
I mean, do you ever think about their wives?

489
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,379
No, I don't think about that.

490
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,049
No...

491
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:48,429
Well, I mean, think about it for a second, because...

492
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:52,266
most of these guys, they are probably married, right?

493
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:56,771
And if their wives knew about you, then...

494
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,983
well, they'd be very upset.

495
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:04,028
- It would ruin their lives. - Probably.

496
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:11,327
And take the guy tonight, for instance.

497
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:14,622
I mean, is he married?

498
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:19,168
Yeah. He is.

499
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:21,128
Does he have money?

500
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:23,965
He does.

501
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:29,095
OK, I mean, imagine this.

502
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:33,850
Your phone... it doesn't have a camera.

503
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:37,645
But, if it did, you'd take this

504
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:40,147
and you'd put it right here.

505
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,024
Go sit over there.

506
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:49,949
And whatever happened in that room... you would have it.

507
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,871
And then what?

508
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:01,210
And then...

509
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,841
And then...?

510
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:16,225
I mean,

511
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:21,397
instead of taking a little money

512
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:24,400
from a lot of men,

513
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:29,113
you could take a lot of money from one.

514
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:36,913
And it's so easy to use these guys.

515
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:43,753
Do you mind if I change the music?

516
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:45,171
No, go ahead.

517
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,716
It was the one thing they didn't take.

518
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:16,869
When everybody leaves you lonely

519
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:20,623
And times are worse than sad

520
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:28,589
And the world is falling on your head

521
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:33,552
Just remember, for all you know

522
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:36,973
Good or bad, come what may

523
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:41,435
You're gonna live tomorrow

524
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:46,774
If you don't die today

525
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:50,319
It takes a muscle to fall in love

526
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:54,699
It takes a muscle to fall in love

527
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:58,703
It takes a muscle to fall in love

528
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:02,999
Now the fear got in me

529
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,127
Cutting me deep

530
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:10,423
That's where it's gonna stay

531
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:14,593
And never leave

532
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:19,390
Someone come and lay my worry

533
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:21,767
Someone come and kill...?

534
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:28,190
I can't sleep.

535
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,079
Are you OK?

536
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:52,965
I was thinking about these guys.

537
00:50:58,263 --> 00:50:59,805
They have wives.

538
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:04,643
They have money.

539
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:14,403
I don't know where they live, but I have their numbers.

540
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,825
OK.

541
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:27,124
That's OK.

542
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:31,170
We could figure that out.

543
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,597
I got the phone.

544
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,726
Take a look.

545
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:52,441
I bought you a shirt.

546
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,111
Thank you.

547
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:57,905
- Do you like blue? - Yeah... I do.

548
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:00,866
I love navy blue. It's got class.

549
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,455
It's perfect. Thank you.

550
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,749
Try it, like this.

551
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:23,222
Hold on! It's not right.

552
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:07,224
There was a time when my world was filled with darkness

553
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,893
DDDarkness

554
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:13,522
And I stopped dreaming now I'm supposed to fill it up with something

555
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:15,024
Something, something

556
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,778
Sorry, excuse me.

557
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:02,696
Are you Jean?

558
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:07,034
- Yes. - Did you see a girl tonight?

559
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:11,038
What?

560
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:15,292
You have the number for Victoria? Please send her a message with your email.

561
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,086
Why?

562
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,129
We have something to show you.

563
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:21,548
Well. Let's see it now.

564
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:27,054
No, I'm sorry. That's not possible.

565
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:31,016
OK. I'm going to speak in French, do you understand?

566
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:34,561
Yes, I understand.

567
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:36,438
I'm a cop.

568
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:38,482
Cop.

569
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:41,026
Understand?

570
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:42,152
Yes.

571
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:45,030
That means that I could,

572
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:47,283
if I wanted to...

573
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:51,620
I can break your fucking head!

574
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:54,540
Do you understand?

575
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:55,916
Yes.

576
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,795
If I fuck a whore, what's it to you?

577
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:05,050
Do you really have something, or are you just fucking with me?

578
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:07,594
Cause if you do, I'll hurt you.

579
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,263
Understand?

580
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:11,974
I'm sorry. It's nothing. Forget it.

581
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:15,686
No!

582
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,109
Stop it.

583
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:07,988
Stop.

584
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:08,257
Stop. Want to see what it feels like?

585
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:10,008
You're such a fucking pain!

586
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:11,802
Hold on, let me show you.

587
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,345
Turn around.

588
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,102
Do you like that?

589
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:21,103
- Yeah? - Yeah.

590
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,563
Like that?

591
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,148
OK, come here.

592
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:32,114
Like that?

593
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,657
Yeah, that's good.

594
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:38,454
- Faster? - Yeah...!

595
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:01,268
Oh, fuck.

596
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,195
Fuck!

597
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,249
Come here.

598
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:19,137
You OK?

599
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:22,224
- Yes. And you? - Yeah.

600
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:55,173
Have I told you about the first time I saw a woman on the Boulevard?

601
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:03,307
I walked down the Boulevard. My mother held my hand.

602
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:06,643
We were going to Sacré Coeur. It was a Sunday.

603
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:13,609
That day...

604
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:17,904
I noticed a woman leaning against the side of a building.

605
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:24,536
She was big.

606
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:27,956
She was wearing a miniskirt, without stockings.

607
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:30,459
She stared at me.

608
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:32,336
She was beautiful.

609
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:35,839
She stared at me.

610
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:43,722
And with her finger, she gave me a sign like this.

611
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:50,979
She was so close, I could smell her.

612
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:56,985
At that time, I didn't know what the smell was.

613
01:00:57,111 --> 01:00:58,153
Now, I know.

614
01:00:58,279 --> 01:00:59,905
It was sex.

615
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:10,499
When I was older I went back to find her,

616
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:14,670
just to ask her, "What did you want with me?"

617
01:01:16,297 --> 01:01:18,256
You see?

618
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:22,260
"What did you want to do with an 8-year-old boy?"

619
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:35,148
Undress.

620
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:20,754
René?

621
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:22,923
Yeah.

622
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:25,717
You have Victoria's number?

623
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:28,136
Excuse me?

624
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,722
There's something Victoria would like to show you.

625
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:32,849
Please send her a message with your email.

626
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:35,185
Why?

627
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:38,438
So she can send you this video. I could also leave it in your mailbox.

628
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:41,733
Wait, wait, wait...

629
01:05:02,106 --> 01:05:03,356
René?

630
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,903
You're a kid.

631
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:10,655
Is this it?

632
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:15,452
- Do you have the film for me? - No, not now.

633
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:22,918
It wasn't easy for me to get this money.

634
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:25,670
I've got a wife, a kid, a home.

635
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:28,882
- Yeah, I understand. - I have responsibilities.

636
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:33,553
Yeah. Yeah... This isn't for me. This is for her.

637
01:05:33,846 --> 01:05:35,680
Is this it?

638
01:05:35,806 --> 01:05:38,850
Come on. Don't make a scene. Please.

639
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:30,193
- I should buy you some shoes. - Yes.

640
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:40,203
- Are you gonna hop on the Métro? - Why?

641
01:06:41,622 --> 01:06:43,373
I think I'm just gonna walk from here.

642
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:44,624
- Yes? - Yeah.

643
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:48,795
- Here? - Yeah. There's a shop close by.

644
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:50,964
- I'll see you in a few hours... OK? - OK.

645
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:52,882
- Bye. - Bye, sweetie.

646
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:58,930
- Bye. - Bye.

647
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:03,643
Are you sure about how you're feeling?

648
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:05,311
Look me in the eyes.

649
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:08,523
So?

650
01:07:08,649 --> 01:07:11,359
Enough said. Want a drink?

651
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:13,695
Just a coke, please.

652
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:22,412
You'll come by again...

653
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:24,122
- I hope so. - You won't forget us?

654
01:07:24,248 --> 01:07:25,707
Of course not.

655
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:28,251
You're staying in Paris, I hope?

656
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:31,379
No, no, I'm not leaving.

657
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:33,590
No, one day at a time.

658
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:35,592
Love's fleeting.

659
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:38,219
Whatever it is, I'm much better right now.

660
01:07:38,345 --> 01:07:40,972
Here's to love!

661
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:43,058
May you find love, too!

662
01:08:10,711 --> 01:08:12,045
Hey!

663
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:18,301
Do you... remember me?

664
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:22,388
Yes! Yes, I remember you.

665
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:24,849
Yeah, Simon. You're...

666
01:08:24,975 --> 01:08:26,017
Marianne.

667
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:27,644
Marianne.

668
01:08:29,814 --> 01:08:32,023
You live around here?

669
01:08:32,149 --> 01:08:33,399
Yes...

670
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:35,568
What about you?

671
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:42,200
- Yeah... - I thought you left Paris.

672
01:08:42,743 --> 01:08:46,412
I was gonna leave, but I liked it so much here

673
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:49,916
that I decided to stick around for a little while.

674
01:08:50,042 --> 01:08:52,752
And... where are you living?

675
01:08:52,878 --> 01:08:55,547
I'm staying at a hotel nearby.

676
01:08:55,673 --> 01:09:00,260
Look. I'm gonna meet somebody right now, but can I call you?

677
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:02,595
- Yeah. You want my number? - Yeah.

678
01:09:05,432 --> 01:09:07,475
- Do you have paper? - Yeah.

679
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:12,832
Look.

680
01:10:17,254 --> 01:10:19,088
This is your fault.

681
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:28,973
It's you who did this.

682
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:12,475
What do I do?

683
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:17,981
- What? - He didn't take the money.

684
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:20,275
OK.

685
01:11:33,664 --> 01:11:35,540
Can I get you anything?

686
01:11:42,172 --> 01:11:44,215
Here, I have something for you.

687
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:50,305
When I was a kid

688
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:53,516
my mom gave me this pin

689
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:57,687
because she said I reminded her of a little fox.

690
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:14,871
Me... I always wanted to be a tiger.

691
01:12:16,081 --> 01:12:17,415
Oh, yeah?

692
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:28,968
I always thought of myself as more of a lion.

693
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:33,931
I always thought of myself as more of a lion.

694
01:12:50,407 --> 01:12:51,908
And what are you studying?

695
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:53,368
French Literature.

696
01:12:53,494 --> 01:12:55,161
- Yeah? - Yeah.

697
01:12:55,287 --> 01:12:56,746
OK. What period?

698
01:12:56,872 --> 01:12:58,831
The Middle Ages and the Renaissance.

699
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:02,543
And what are you studying?

700
01:13:02,669 --> 01:13:06,172
I graduated, earlier this year actually.

701
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:08,508
But I was studying Neuroscience.

702
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:11,928
My focus was the relationship between the eye and the brain.

703
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:15,348
My thesis project was about peripheral vision.

704
01:13:15,474 --> 01:13:18,434
It dealt with something called 'crowding' and 'size pooling'.

705
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:23,398
How the width of one object is given a weighted average of the objects around it.

706
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:25,358
It's called 'size pooling'.

707
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:28,611
Anyway, it's boring, I know.

708
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:32,907
But it was published, actually.

709
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:36,285
And what are you doing in Paris?

710
01:13:38,455 --> 01:13:40,039
Honestly?

711
01:13:40,165 --> 01:13:41,582
Yeah.

712
01:13:42,292 --> 01:13:45,378
Absolutely nothing. I...

713
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:48,881
I came here to do nothing at all for a little while.

714
01:13:50,175 --> 01:13:51,467
OK.

715
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:55,471
- Do you mind if I ask you something? - No.

716
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:58,933
I was curious about...

717
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:03,104
your eyes... how they move like this.

718
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:04,188
Yeah...

719
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:08,901
It comes from my father.

720
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:13,114
And it is called "nystagmus."

721
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,199
- Nystagmus. - Yeah.

722
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:18,411
OK. I don't know what that would be in English.

723
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:19,912
Yeah.

724
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:25,835
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to embarrass you. It's very...

725
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:29,714
very charming, actually.

726
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,175
Thank you. I'm OK.

727
01:14:33,093 --> 01:14:35,470
I mean it. It's very pretty.

728
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:37,930
Thank you.

729
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:19,430
- Simon? - Yeah, it's me.

730
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:22,558
Where were you?

731
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:24,644
I went to get us some food.

732
01:15:26,563 --> 01:15:29,023
Why were you gone for so long?

733
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:32,401
Yeah, I'm... I'm sorry about that.

734
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:34,362
I went for a walk.

735
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:41,035
Are you OK?

736
01:15:57,010 --> 01:16:00,054
Listen. Tomorrow, I'm gonna need some money

737
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:02,306
because I'd like to buy you something.

738
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:09,772
What are you doing?

739
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:18,114
Make love to me.

740
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:20,866
Oh, no, no, no, no...

741
01:17:47,746 --> 01:17:50,873
'René. Leave me a message after the beep.'

742
01:17:50,999 --> 01:17:53,876
Hey, René, it's me again.

743
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:57,463
Listen. We didn't expect to have to call you again so soon, but...

744
01:17:57,589 --> 01:17:59,423
we need to talk about more money.

745
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:04,720
I'm just gonna keep calling you until I reach you. And, OK...

746
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:06,222
Thank you, goodbye.

747
01:18:19,861 --> 01:18:21,737
'René. Leave me a...'

748
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:28,661
René. Leave me a message after the beep.

749
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:36,293
René. Leave me a message after the beep.

750
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:39,755
René, pick up your fucking phone when I call you.

751
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:05,531
Walking up to me expecting

752
01:19:05,657 --> 01:19:09,201
Walking up to me expecting words

753
01:19:09,327 --> 01:19:11,162
It happens all the time

754
01:19:12,956 --> 01:19:15,332
Present company accepted

755
01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:18,502
Present company except the worst

756
01:19:19,045 --> 01:19:20,963
It happens every night

757
01:19:26,511 --> 01:19:30,473
Present company excluded in every way

758
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:37,855
Present company

759
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:40,649
Makes me wanna stay

760
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:59,376
Killing it with close inspection

761
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:02,463
Killing it can only make it worse

762
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:05,007
It sort of makes it breed

763
01:20:06,843 --> 01:20:09,178
Present company accepting

764
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:11,972
Presently we all expect the worst

765
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:14,892
Works just like a need

766
01:20:20,398 --> 01:20:22,066
Present company

767
01:20:22,776 --> 01:20:24,652
Included in the fight

768
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:08,779
Don't you want me to wake up?

769
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:12,491
Then give me just a bit of your...?

770
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:22,793
Could I just look at you?

771
01:21:22,919 --> 01:21:25,129
- Yes. - Yeah?

772
01:21:52,282 --> 01:21:54,116
I don't like this.

773
01:21:56,202 --> 01:21:59,246
- What? - The way you're looking at me.

774
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:05,169
Why? You're beautiful.

775
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:06,545
Come here.

776
01:22:53,593 --> 01:22:56,261
- Are you hungry? - Yeah.

777
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:11,735
- Where should we go? - Montmartre.

778
01:23:28,962 --> 01:23:30,546
Jesus... I'm sorry.

779
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:32,339
Who is it?

780
01:23:32,465 --> 01:23:36,427
It's just my... my cousin who I've been staying with.

781
01:23:40,306 --> 01:23:41,390
What?

782
01:23:41,516 --> 01:23:45,060
No... I thought you were staying at a hotel.

783
01:23:45,979 --> 01:23:47,021
What?

784
01:23:47,147 --> 01:23:48,939
Yeah, you told me so.

785
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:53,986
No... I was staying at a hotel when I first arrived. Now I'm staying with my cousin.

786
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:58,782
But he keeps calling me...

787
01:23:58,908 --> 01:24:02,494
and, in case it's important, I should talk to him.

788
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:05,080
Can you get the bill, maybe order me another coffee?

789
01:24:05,206 --> 01:24:06,582
- Yeah. - Thank you.

790
01:24:09,627 --> 01:24:11,837
Hey... Everything all right?

791
01:24:11,963 --> 01:24:14,673
'Why didn't you come home last night?'

792
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:18,385
I... I know.

793
01:24:18,511 --> 01:24:20,804
I'm sorry I stayed out late.

794
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:23,182
'Who are you with?'

795
01:24:23,308 --> 01:24:25,559
Just a friend.

796
01:24:25,685 --> 01:24:27,061
'What friend?'

797
01:24:27,937 --> 01:24:32,357
Listen. I can't talk right now, but don't worry. I'll be home soon.

798
01:24:38,948 --> 01:24:41,533
- Are you OK? - Yeah, I'm fine.

799
01:24:41,659 --> 01:24:45,204
It's just my parents, they were worried about me.

800
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:47,414
They kept calling my cousin apparently.

801
01:24:48,458 --> 01:24:50,709
I haven't talked to them in a week.

802
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:56,590
- But your parents are divorced. - What?

803
01:24:58,259 --> 01:25:00,719
You told me your parents are divorced.

804
01:25:00,845 --> 01:25:04,723
Yeah, they are divorced. I mean, my mother and my biological father.

805
01:25:04,849 --> 01:25:07,142
But my mother remarried. I have a step-dad.

806
01:25:10,897 --> 01:25:12,481
One second.

807
01:25:13,691 --> 01:25:17,486
- Hello, René? - 'No. Who is this?'

808
01:25:17,695 --> 01:25:21,657
- I'm sorry. Who's this? - 'Mathilde.

809
01:25:22,283 --> 01:25:24,743
'Did you call René's phone earlier?'

810
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:27,913
I... Yes, but can I please speak to René?

811
01:25:28,039 --> 01:25:30,707
'No, you won't be able to speak to René.'

812
01:25:32,502 --> 01:25:35,003
- Excuse me, what did you say? - René's gone.

813
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:39,258
'Tell me why you were calling René's phone so many times.'

814
01:25:39,843 --> 01:25:43,929
Listen, now's not a good time for me. Can you please have René call me?

815
01:25:44,347 --> 01:25:45,973
Not now, sir!

816
01:25:50,436 --> 01:25:53,480
I'm sorry. This guy... Jesus!

817
01:25:55,316 --> 01:25:57,025
Are you all right?

818
01:25:57,402 --> 01:26:00,320
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just having a bad day.

819
01:26:03,783 --> 01:26:05,909
It's fun having coffee with you!

820
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:07,411
What?

821
01:26:07,537 --> 01:26:09,371
I'm just kidding.

822
01:26:09,497 --> 01:26:12,082
- What does that mean? - Nothing! I'm kidding.

823
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:15,294
Jesus Christ!

824
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:16,962
You know what, I'm sorry. I...

825
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:19,047
- If you have to go, go. - I...

826
01:26:19,966 --> 01:26:23,135
I don't have any money. Can I get you back?

827
01:26:23,261 --> 01:26:24,386
Yeah.

828
01:26:24,971 --> 01:26:26,388
I had fun.

829
01:26:27,724 --> 01:26:29,558
OK, I'll call you.

830
01:26:30,768 --> 01:26:32,603
Excuse me.

831
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:56,376
I got a call

832
01:26:56,502 --> 01:26:58,587
from a woman today.

833
01:27:00,632 --> 01:27:02,674
And I think that we need to leave.

834
01:27:04,093 --> 01:27:06,011
Where were you last night?

835
01:27:07,972 --> 01:27:09,806
Why didn't you come home?

836
01:27:11,976 --> 01:27:13,769
I told you.

837
01:27:14,562 --> 01:27:16,063
I was out.

838
01:27:18,816 --> 01:27:20,108
Listen.

839
01:27:22,403 --> 01:27:25,864
We need to go as soon as possible.

840
01:27:46,636 --> 01:27:48,428
You disgust me.

841
01:27:50,598 --> 01:27:53,809
Did you not hear what I just said? We need to go.

842
01:27:55,979 --> 01:27:57,688
Get the fuck out.

843
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:02,484
You're a piece of shit.

844
01:28:03,361 --> 01:28:04,903
And you lie.

845
01:28:05,029 --> 01:28:08,407
- I don't understand when you speak French. - You're a liar.

846
01:28:10,994 --> 01:28:12,077
All right.

847
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:17,291
I'm leaving.

848
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:20,627
That's right, leave. You're pathetic.

849
01:28:20,753 --> 01:28:22,879
And take your money.

850
01:28:23,006 --> 01:28:24,673
Take it.

851
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:26,800
I don't need your money.

852
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:33,557
Look at yourself, look...

853
01:28:33,683 --> 01:28:35,392
You're a coward.

854
01:28:38,521 --> 01:28:40,981
You're not a man.

855
01:28:43,693 --> 01:28:47,154
You know, we get what we deserve.

856
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,865
What the fuck are you talking about?

857
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:53,910
I did this for you. You could use that money for your son.

858
01:29:08,634 --> 01:29:11,303
I never asked you for anything, Simon.

859
01:29:14,057 --> 01:29:16,183
I was doing just fine as I was.

860
01:29:24,317 --> 01:29:25,734
I called.

861
01:29:28,029 --> 01:29:29,821
What?

862
01:29:30,490 --> 01:29:32,407
You heard me.

863
01:29:37,413 --> 01:29:38,955
You called who?

864
01:29:42,877 --> 01:29:45,629
- What did you do? - I called her!

865
01:29:48,424 --> 01:29:50,092
Oh, you cunt.

866
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:54,429
You're all fucking cunts.

867
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:00,769
I love you.

868
01:30:02,605 --> 01:30:04,981
I love you. I do. I love you.

869
01:30:06,192 --> 01:30:07,442
You're crazy.

870
01:30:08,152 --> 01:30:09,903
You're a sick man.

871
01:30:10,905 --> 01:30:12,155
You're sick!

872
01:30:14,867 --> 01:30:16,243
Fucking bitch!

873
01:30:37,515 --> 01:30:39,391
Put your fucking arms down!

874
01:31:52,798 --> 01:31:54,549
Fuck.

875
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:22,911
- Hey. - Hi.

876
01:32:24,956 --> 01:32:27,123
I'm sorry, I'm freezing.

877
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:30,418
I was waiting outside for somebody to let me in.

878
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:39,678
- I'm sorry about earlier. - That's OK.

879
01:32:43,349 --> 01:32:44,724
Are you OK?

880
01:32:48,271 --> 01:32:49,938
No, I'm...

881
01:32:52,108 --> 01:32:53,984
I don't feel well.

882
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:59,239
I'm sorry, I...

883
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:04,035
I didn't know where else to go. I just wanted to see you.

884
01:33:10,501 --> 01:33:14,045
Do you think I could stay with you guys for just a couple of days?

885
01:33:19,969 --> 01:33:23,096
Would you come in and sit?

886
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:37,485
I... I'm sorry to interrupt.

887
01:33:44,285 --> 01:33:48,079
It would just be for a couple of days, until I figure out...

888
01:33:50,249 --> 01:33:52,167
where else to go.

889
01:33:56,213 --> 01:33:59,924
Yeah, I'm...

890
01:34:01,177 --> 01:34:04,971
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

891
01:34:14,315 --> 01:34:16,149
You can't stay here.

892
01:34:16,275 --> 01:34:18,026
- OK... - Sorry...

893
01:34:47,431 --> 01:34:51,559
Happy birthday to you

894
01:34:51,769 --> 01:34:55,313
Happy birthday to you...

895
01:34:55,940 --> 01:35:00,694
Happy birthday, Carlo

896
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:05,240
Happy birthday to you

897
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:15,542
Thanks guys!

898
01:35:16,627 --> 01:35:18,253
Oh, shit.

899
01:35:18,379 --> 01:35:20,672
Carlo, someone's here to see you.

900
01:35:25,511 --> 01:35:27,721
What are you doing here?

901
01:35:27,847 --> 01:35:29,764
I'm sorry to interrupt, but...

902
01:35:31,225 --> 01:35:35,729
I didn't know anybody would be here. I just came to get my luggage.

903
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:39,399
- Are you OK? - Yeah, I'm fine.

904
01:35:39,525 --> 01:35:42,485
I met a girl. I was traveling light for a little while.

905
01:35:42,611 --> 01:35:44,529
- That's good. - Yeah.

906
01:35:44,905 --> 01:35:48,074
It's my birthday so I'm having a few friends here...

907
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:49,951
- Happy birthday. - Thank you.

908
01:35:51,829 --> 01:35:55,039
Let me introduce you. He's the son of my mother's friend.

909
01:35:55,166 --> 01:35:57,000
Sort of my American cousin.

910
01:35:57,209 --> 01:35:58,835
- Hi. - Hi.

911
01:35:59,044 --> 01:36:00,795
You want to drink a glass?

912
01:36:00,921 --> 01:36:02,839
Do you mind if I take a shower?

913
01:36:02,965 --> 01:36:04,716
No... Please do.

914
01:36:06,427 --> 01:36:07,594
Excuse me.

915
01:36:07,928 --> 01:36:09,888
- Have a nice evening. - You, too.

916
01:36:23,068 --> 01:36:25,945
I was putting him up for a while and...

917
01:36:26,322 --> 01:36:28,531
He didn't stay long.

918
01:37:52,825 --> 01:37:56,578
'Your call has been forwarded to an automated voice message system.'

919
01:37:56,787 --> 01:37:59,539
'Hi, you've reached Mary. Please leave a message.'

920
01:38:01,250 --> 01:38:01,750
Mom?

921
01:38:11,135 --> 01:38:14,929
Mom...

922
01:38:16,181 --> 01:38:17,432
Mom!

923
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:20,685
Mom...

924
01:38:54,678 --> 01:38:56,554
'Michelle...

927

'I've never cried as much as I have in that time about anything or anyone.

928
01:39:07,942 --> 01:39:12,695
'I know now that the only way for either one of us to grow, especially me,

929
01:39:12,821 --> 01:39:14,989
'is for us to have time apart.

930
01:39:19,745 --> 01:39:22,288
'I became too nested and reliant on you.

931
01:39:22,414 --> 01:39:25,041
'Emotionally and even financially, in a way -

932
01:39:25,167 --> 01:39:27,627
'something I had never expected, or wanted.

933
01:39:27,836 --> 01:39:32,757
'I know my behavior at times probably only made the atmosphere more toxic.

934
01:39:32,883 --> 01:39:36,844
'I have so much love in my heart to give, and I know the man that I want to become.

01:39:36,971 --> 01:39:39,305
'The kind of man that would make my father proud.

'It's not lost on me that for almost 5 years

937
01:39:41,433 --> 01:39:44,227
'I had one of the finest women I've ever known as my partner.

938
01:39:44,353 --> 01:39:47,605
'I had the love of my life, and now I don't and that kills me.'

939
01:39:48,065 --> 01:39:51,526
- No, take the passport out, please. - What?

940
01:39:51,735 --> 01:39:54,696
You take the passport out of the wallet.

941
01:39:57,866 --> 01:39:58,950
OK.

942
01:40:03,414 --> 01:40:06,916
So, what have you been doing in Paris?

943
01:40:07,042 --> 01:40:08,835
I was here on holiday.

944
01:40:10,754 --> 01:40:14,424
And what did you do?

945
01:40:17,219 --> 01:40:19,262
- Excuse me? - What do you do?

946
01:40:20,139 --> 01:40:23,474
- What is your job? - I was a student, but I graduated.

947
01:40:24,643 --> 01:40:27,854
And what do you study?

948
01:40:30,315 --> 01:40:31,941
French Literature.

949
01:40:35,779 --> 01:40:38,489
You know that you stayed more than 90 days.

950
01:40:41,076 --> 01:40:42,577
No, I...

951
01:40:43,245 --> 01:40:45,204
I'm sorry. I didn't realize.

952
01:40:47,207 --> 01:40:48,666
Hold on.

953
01:40:49,835 --> 01:40:53,713

OK, it's fine. You can go.

When everybody leaves you lonely

973
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:51,091
And times are worse than sad

974
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:59,058
And the world is falling
on your head

975
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:04,021
Just remember, for all you know

976
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,441
Good or bad, come what may

977
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,904
You're gonna live tomorrow

978

If you don't die today

979
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:20,788
It takes a muscle to fall in love

980
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:25,167
It takes a muscle
to fall in love

981
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:29,171
It takes a muscle to fall in love

982
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,467
Now the fear got in me...?

983
00:01:56,991 --> 00:02:00,369
你母亲说你现在正处于困难期

984
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:03,747
是的, 我...我和女朋友分手了.

985
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,752
我们从高中结束的时候开始...直到大学结束.

986
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,921
她做什么的？

987
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:16,385
她在学校学市场管理.她在广告代理业找到了分工作.

988
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,762
你呢?

989
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,431
我? 我...我是学神经系统科学的...

990
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,768
研究眼睛和大脑的关系的.

991
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,104
我的论文项目是间接视力.

992
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,773
它是通过 'crowding'和 'size pooling'来处理的.

993
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,942
一个物体有多宽

994
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:35,070
是由周围物体加权平均决定的.

995
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,448
这种效应称为 'size pooling'.

996
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,785
- 实际上，它被出版了.- 很好啊.

997
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,414
我不确定我明白,但很高兴你的论文被出版了。

998
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,958
是的，这很好, 没什么人会知道。

999
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,838
你们在一起多久了?

1000
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,884
大约5年了.

1001
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,636
毕业后我和她一起住.

1002
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,471
事情...

1003
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,599
开始的时候还好,

1004
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:07,644
不久之后，她就不再高兴了...或者说我没去让她高兴.

1005
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,521
她不喜欢她现在做的.

1006
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:13,150
我尝试去支持她,鼓励她去解决. 但是之后...

1007
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,029
我现在住在家里了.

1008
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:25,662
打扰一下.我现在感觉不太好.还在倒时差.

1009
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,540
你明白"时差?"

1010
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,375
是的. 不用担心.

1011
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,546
你们现在还可以聊天吗?

1012
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,675
不.

1013
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,261
我们结束的方式...

1014
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,348
她开始下班晚回家...

1015
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,516
一天晚上，她和我一起睡

1016
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,186
我去抱她,然后我...

1017
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:53,148
在她身上闻到到那种味道.

1018
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,900
什么意思?

1019
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,489
不好意思.这可能有点不恰当.

1020
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,324
不会，继续.

1021
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,160
我...

1022
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,413
我闻到这些东西.

1023
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:11,250
她闻起来像性爱.

1024
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,043
像汗水还有乳胶.

1025
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:17,339
然后这些家伙, 无论他是谁,都是上了她.

1026
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,762
我的意思是, 她否认了,

1027
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,514
但是这很明显.

1028
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,269
我不知道, 可能是我反应过度了.

1029
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,856
无论怎样，她是个婊子.

1030
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,903
我想去认识些新的人.

1031
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,870
你好?

1032
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,248
OK,谢谢了,我马上下去.

1033
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,958
我的出租车就在楼下.

1034
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,961
- 我需要帮你拿行李吗?- 不用了.

1035
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,881
你知道所有的东西在哪了吧.

1036
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:03,093
走之前换一下床单...

1037
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,054
确保微波炉关了还有厨房的清洁.

1038
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,391
是的... 是的.你会离开多久啊?

1039
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:14,104
我要去南部.所以可能是一个星期，可能是一个月.

1040
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,273
不知道，要看情况.

1041
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,942
但是你要在这儿呆一个星期吗？或者更长的时间呢?

1042
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:22,362
不. 只是一个星期. 我要确定我要去的下一个地方.

1043
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,323
噢，好的.

1044
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,075
把钥匙留在外面垫子底下.

1045
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,286
我对你刚来到我就要离开感到很抱歉.

1046
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,830
没关系.不用担心.

1047
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,666
- 旅途安全.- 谢谢.

1048
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,920
- 替我问候你妈妈.- 我会的....

1049
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,715
- 拜拜.- Ciao.

1050
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:10,327
如果墙壁太薄，你会...... ?

1051
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,620
'嘿, Chelle belle...

1052
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,583
"亲爱的Michelle..."

1053
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,420
'嘿, Michelle... 最近还好吗?

1054
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,922
'一切还顺利吗?

1055
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,592
'我知道你说过叫我不用联系你.

1056
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,440
'我知道，上次我的谈话,我同意不去联系你.

1057
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:55,515
'但是我现在在巴黎, 开始为期几个月的环游旅程.

1058
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,767
'我们经常说要一起来这里,

1059
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,729
'我只是想让你知道.这里非常棒.

1060
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,023
'目前为止,一切都很棒.

1061
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,234
'我和我表兄Carlo还有他朋友在一起。
.

1062
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,029
'我... 我碰见了一个人, 实际上.

1063
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,781
'我想告诉你我遇见了一个人.

1064
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:16,411
'我在这里遇见了一些有趣的人，还有在练习我的法语.

1065
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,246
'我想你了.

1066
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,459
'希望你一切都好,然后也许我们很快就可以说话了?

1067
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,336
'也许我们很快就可以说话了...

1068
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,337
'Love...

1069
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,717
'Yours... sincerely.

1070
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,178
'Sincerely, Si.'

1071
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,679
艹!

1072
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,855
There was a time...?

1073
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:22,060
天堂已经到达了人间.

1074
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,481
这告诉了我们什么?

1075
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,235
上帝没有抛弃我们.

1076
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,697
他在注视着我们.

1077
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,657
他爱我们.

1078
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,995
虽然这只是信号,他已经展示出了他的存在.

1079
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,581
他在告诉我们.

1080
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,000
你不是孤单一人.

1081
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,391
抱歉.

1082
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:06,813
不好意思...可以借个火吗?

1083
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,064
可以.

1084
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,323
谢谢，你们人很好.

1085
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,413
- 可以了吗?
- 嗯.

1086
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,332
谢谢.

1087
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,169
- 你们要去 Métro?- 当然.

1088
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,008
你们...?

1089
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:39,763
- 你们都住在巴黎吗?- 实际上我们住在附近.

1090
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:45,060
很抱歉但是...什么?

1091
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,480
我们都住在这附近....

1092
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:51,066
好的，我明白了.

1093
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:58,031
我, 我在这里住几天但是...

1094
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,576
然后我会去...

1095
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,995
会去...

1096
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,748
事实上，我会去...

1097
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,458
东部，可能...

1098
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:13,088
我对我的法语很抱歉.它很糟糕，我知道.

1099
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,048
还可以，不用担心.

1100
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,093
- 你叫什么名字?-什么?

1101
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,012
- 什么?- 你的名字?

1102
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,016
有问题?

1103
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,102
什么?

1104
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,479
你连道歉都不用说?

1105
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,523
他不是法国人...

1106
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:32,732
不，我...

1107
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,609
我很抱歉，先生.

1108
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,403
他不说法语?

1109
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,447
好吧，那我想你道歉吧.

1110
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,616
- 好的...- 好的?

1111
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,034
不用内疚.

1112
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,078
好的，我很抱歉.

1113
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:48,873
你的手很小.就想女人一样.

1114
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,417
很好...

1115
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,003
为什么你有两个女人，我一个都没有?

1116
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,672
你够了.

1117
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,091
- 听着，我很抱歉...- 等下!

1118
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,634
你为什么要把这些美女藏起来?

1119
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,840
- 请松手!- 你在嘲笑我吗?

1120
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,972
没有，他妈的我没在嘲笑你!

1121
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,143
操!

1122
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:14,566
- 对不起.- 不用，还好.

1123
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,818
你知道现在几点吗?

1124
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,112
10:05.

1125
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,157
我们没时间了

1126
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,286
不是很多.

1127
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,913
肚子饿了.

1128
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,545
很高兴见到你们

1129
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:36,796
- 拜.- 拜.

1130
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,174
- 回头见?- 很高兴认识你.

1131
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:13,208
你喜欢正常女人吗?

1132
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,959
操我...

1133
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,670
我很好色.

1134
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,299
写下来你喜欢什么.

1135
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,512
你现在可以听到我吗?

1136
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,141
操...

1137
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:35,480
操我菊花 ,操我菊花.

1138
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,399
噢，Yeah...

1139
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,945
操我, 宝贝.

1140
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:48,326
你的菊花太热情了.

1141
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,662
Yeah...

1142
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,126
给我颜射.

1143
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:01,339
给我颜射.给我颜射.

1144
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,552
给我颜射.

1145
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,103
操我...

1146
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:23,528
操我..操我... 操我...

1147
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,243
操我...

1148
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:49,721
狠狠地操我... 操我...

1149
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,600
操我...

1150
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,604
你射了吗?

1151
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,772
是的?射了吗?

1152
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,109
再找我, 甜心.

1153
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,914
不用客气, 伙计.

1154
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,166
谢谢.

1155
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,074
'你好, Michelle.

1156
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,117
'这段时间都没收到你的回信.

1157
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,995
我不确定你是没收到邮件还是在忽视我.

1158
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:59,707
我只是想知道你最近怎样了.至少你可以回一下我.

1159
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,460

- 是吗?- 是的.

1164
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,896
一分钟... 你想试一下法国阴道吗？钢管舞? 脱衣舞夜总会?

1165

1166
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,467
我的朋友...

想和些美女度过这个晚上吗？

1168
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:54,929

一个美好的夜晚，加上几个美女.有兴趣吗?

1170
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,308
就在这附近.

1171
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,146
你想说什么?

1172
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,190
进去, 喝杯东西, 看看周围...

1173
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,609
就会有美女过来.

1174
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:12,196
你如果想要更多, 你想做爱,那也是可以的, OK?

1175
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,574
多少钱?

1176
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,701
10欧元每杯饮料...

1177
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,953
如果你不喜欢,你可以离开.

1178
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,123
怎么样?这是在巴黎很好的一个纪念品.

1179
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,250
相信我, 我不是骗子.

- Sabrina, 很高兴认识你.- 一样.

1186
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,917

00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,794

纽约.

1192
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,472
- 纽约市...- 是的.

1193
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,141
我说得不是很好, 英语.

1194
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,478
我介绍一下我的朋友,对你来说有问题吗?

1195
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,980
- 好的，可以.- Victoria, 过来这里.

1196
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,358
- 这是我的朋友Victoria.- Hi.

1197
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,151
你都准备好了? 没问题?

1198
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:35,113
- 确定.- 好的，很好.

1199
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,700
我去下洗手间再回来, OK?

1200
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,577
- OK.- 拜.

1201
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,874

1202
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:50,044
- 多少钱?- 免费.

1203
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,338
我们只坐在那里,就是这些.

00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,257
- 嗯，好的.- 来吧.

1205
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,487
你很帅

1206
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,952
我不想告诉你这只是为了工作,我这么认为.

1207
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,164
这很好. 谢谢.

1208
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,554
看到这些女孩吗?

1209
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,265
- Sabrina?- 和我聊天那个人...

1210
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:48,019
这个女人，她不是需要钱，她是渴望钱!

1211
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:52,773
今天她有3个客,而我只有一个.

1212
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,569
一般来说, 这就是个交易, 懂?

1213
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,906
如果她接了一个客人,那下一个就是我的..

1214
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,242
然后下一个是她的,这是约定.

1215
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:09,248
我对她就像姐妹那样. 我有吃的,就会和她分享.

1216
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,876
她高兴了, 我会替她高兴.

1217
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,796
但是对她来说，她不怎么分享.

1218
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:21,135
- 对于我?我很需要这些钱.- 我明白.

1219
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,059
所以你是来游览巴黎的?

1220
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,810
是的。是的...

1221
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,396
- 你有女朋友吗?- 没有.

1222
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,690
你做什么的?

1223
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:39,612
现在?没有.我刚毕业.

1224
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,075
你看起来不太好.

1225
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,078
我要近些看你.

1226
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,872
我近视.

1227
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,749
是吗?

1228
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:55,461
我在大学研究眼睛.

1229
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,464
- 真的?- 是的.

1230
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:04,679
我研究眼睛和大脑的关系的.

1231
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:08,140
- 你的法语很好.- 不，不是的.

1232
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:12,103
- 是的，你说的很好.-我在高中学的, 可是很糟糕.

1233
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,901
你要做爱吗?

1234
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,864
多少钱?

1235
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,660
如果你说150, 我会说 OK.

1236
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:33,124
一些女生会说"就这个价钱",然后她们不会低于... 200.

1237
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:37,128
和我, 我可以去到150.

1238
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,921
- 150...?- 是的.

1239
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:42,216
我给一半给我老板.如果我赚50,我会给她 25.

1240
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,426
OK.

1241
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,052
但是...

1242
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:50,933
和你一起, 就不像是和那些胖子, 丑男人一起睡. 你知道?

1243
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,811
和你,我会挺喜欢的.

1244
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,397
我...

1245
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,069
我把钱都花在酒吧了.我只有信用卡了

1246
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,865
-你有信用卡?- 是的.

1247
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,576
那也可以.把它给我.

1248
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,121
OK.

1249
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,339
谢谢.

1250
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,054
Nadia?

1251
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,947
对不起.

1252
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,616
没关系.

1253
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,659
我有个伤疤.

1254
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,496
一条围巾?

1255
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:57,625
不,伤疤. S-C-A-R... 'scar'.

1256
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,127
这里.

1257
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,421
- 没关系.- 我只是认为最后告诉你.

1258
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:06,092
我喜欢事先告诉别人.

1259
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,360
感觉怎样?

1260
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:26,904
非常好.

1261
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,235
我可以...

1262
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,362
我可以看看你吗?

1263
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:09,530
可以.

1264
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:14,994
- 这就是那伤疤.- 没关系.

1265
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,459
你可以转过去吗?

1266
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,420
天哪!

1267
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:08,506
噢，天哪!

1268
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,800
操...

1269
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:17,515
- 对不起.- 没关系.

1270
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,308
我不想来

1271
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,936
没关系.只要你高兴.

1272
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,483
是的... 我很高兴.我很高兴.

1273
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,796
谢谢.

1274
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,786
你还好吗?

1275
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,205
- 你呢?- 还好.

1276
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,549
那是什么?

1277
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:40,764
一个狐狸.我母亲给我的.

1278
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,982
看.

1279
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,280

1280
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,160
- 很乱.- 不... 还好.

1281
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,911
等下...

1282
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,581
我要把它脱了.

1283
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,252
脱了感觉好点.

1284
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,342
记一下我的号码,你喜欢的话.

1285
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:21,055
记一下我的号码,我们可以在外面见面.

1286
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:24,141
同样价钱, 但是更好.

1287
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,602
OK.

1288
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,556
我想她.

1289
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,977
'我知道,甜心.

1290
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,439
'现在过得还可以.会变得更好的.'

1291
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,858
是的.

1292
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,495
你有和他聊天吗?

1293
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,422
'Si?

1294
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,636
'Si, 你可以看着我吗?

1295
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,515
'喂? 喂!'

1296
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,352
没有.我没和她说过话.

1297
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,314
'我不明白.

1298
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,734
如果你还想和她一起,

1299
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,111
你应该打给她.'

1300
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,238
唔.我不知道.

1301
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,199
是的，我猜.

1302
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,244
这对她不好.

1303
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,499
'这很可笑.

1304
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,710
'所有你对她所做的...

'去找个法国女孩吧.

'Si?'

1312

我不是你女朋友,你可以告诉哦你要的是什么.

1313
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:06,553
是吗?

1314
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,097
好的.

1315

- 说, "操我."- 操我.

1316

说, "操我

1317

事实是我不认为我了解你,或者说我根本不了解你.

1326
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:07,573
'我不认为你了解我.

1327
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,534
'我在前几个月意识到这些.

1328
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,994
'我现在很幸福.

1329
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,288
'最后一次我们见面,你吓到我了

1330
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,915
'在你身边我不再感到舒适.

1331
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:20,544
'希望你一切都好.Sincerely, Michelle.'

1332
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,614
真的? 我想念一个派对?

1333
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,325
不, 那个非常棒.我为我自己办的.

1334
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,619
什么, 就像我不需要钱?

1335
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,080
嘿,女孩们!

1336
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,415
- 最近怎么样了?- 所以人都在这里了.

1337
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,710
我们还能去什么地方?

1338
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,629
要烟吗?

1339
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,509
你为什么周围看?

1340
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:36,013
你有毛病吗?

1341
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,640
我在街上被攻击了.我可以进来吗?

1342
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,777
谁打你了?

1343
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:36,448
我...我被攻击了.那些人,他们拿走了我的东西.

1344
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,284
哪里?

1345
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,620
地铁站.

1346
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,208
对不起.

1347
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:49,211
你想我做什么?我在工作.

1348
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,629
我...

1349
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,589
你没有朋友吗?

1350
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,300
不，我...

1351
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,928
我只是需要些帮助

1352
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,430
还有我不知道我能去什么地方.

1353
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,729
我可以很你呆几分钟吗?

1354
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,397
不，现在不行.

1355
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:17,823
OK...

1356
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:38,510
如果你想的画, 我们可以在2小时之后见面

1357
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:41,054
在那个叫Le Café au Rendezvous那里.

1358
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,890
左边, 角落了.

1359
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:45,851
可以了吗?

1360
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:50,772
你什么时候去那里?

1361
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,816
下班之后.

1362
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:55,652
两个小时之内.

1363
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,655
OK.

1364
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,702
- 你还好吗?- 是的，还可以.

1365
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,356
你住在哪里?

1366
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:36,109
我，我不....

1367
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,236
你不知道你住哪里?

1368
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,323
不...我应该要离开了.

1369
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,826
- 什么?- 我应该今晚就离开的.

1370
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:54,586
你现在没地方住了.

1371
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,296
不.

1372
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:58,590
不是现在.

1373
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:07,474
好吧，那... 你愿意住在我的房子?

1374
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,978
那样可以吗?

1375
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:19,653
- 走吧. 我来付钱?- 是的，谢谢你.

1376
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,163
坐在那里e.

1377
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:43,093
- 你的房子很漂亮.- 我从一个老太太那里租的.

1378
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,887
她有些孤独.

1379
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,688
你的父母...

1380
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,608
你不能向他们求助吗?

1381
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:01,152
我不和我父母说话了.

1382
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:04,781
但是我明天会想出些解决办法的.

1383
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,872
谢谢.

1384
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:37,105
操... 刺痛.

1385
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,500
- 就这样?- 是的.

1386
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,843
你还有其他伤口吗?

1387
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:09,763
对不起, 什么?

1388
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,514
哪里...

1389
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,392
还有哪里疼?

1390
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:20,482
我不知道.我不... 我不确定.

1391
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:26,780
让我看看.

1392
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,770
你想要什么?

1393
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:02,399
我睡不着.

1394
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:06,069
你可以和我聊多一会吗?

1395
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,363
关于什么的?

1396
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,288
我不知道.

1397
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,791
任何东西.

1398
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:26,923
Victoria是你的真名吗?

1399
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,807
我的名字是Noura.

1400
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,395
- Nora?- Noura...

1401
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,313
Noura.

1402
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:50,363
你在酒吧工作了多久?

1403
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,408
几个月.

1404
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,831
What did you do before?

1405
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:05,837
我之前在巴黎外面的一间超市上班.

1406
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:08,673
你从那里过来的?

1407
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,135
是的.

1408
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:15,763
我住在那里直到...

1409
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,765
我离婚了.

1410
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,480
你结过婚?

1411
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,029
他很坏吗?

1412
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,663
他神暴力.

1413
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:46,711
他从不让我出去.

1414
00:41:57,264 --> 00:42:00,183
有一次，我醒了,在午夜的时候.

1415
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:04,687
我怀孕了.

1416
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:09,609
我有了个宝宝在我身体里.

1417
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,361
我的肚子太大了.

1418
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,280
我突然就醒了...

1419
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,286
然后周围都是血.

1420
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:27,252
我去到厨房.

1421
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:32,840
我丈夫也在那里.他看着我.

1422
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:36,803
我全身都是学,到处都是.

1423
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,389
在我到医院之前...

1424
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:43,393
他在厨房上了我.

1425
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,615
你明白我刚才说的吗?

1426
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:02,036
我认为是的,你有一个儿子.

1427
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,136
谢谢你对我这么好.

1428
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:13,775
'嘿，妈妈. 我在Prague,然后准备去Sarajevo.

1429
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,944
'我很抱歉没和你联系,这里信号很差.

1430
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:20,490
'我比之前感觉好很多,所以不用担心我

1431
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:23,284
我遇见了某个人, 我认为你会喜欢她.

1432
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,411
'她不是个婊子..

1433
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,455
'当我回去的时候,我想重新思考

1434
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:30,875
'不让你和父亲那样痛苦,总是围着房子闷闷不乐.

1435
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:34,337
'我在这里感觉很好,这旅程值了.

1436
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:37,924
'我认为你会惊讶我回去是会吸引多少焦点.

1437
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,635
'我爱你. 想父亲问候.

1438
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:43,262
'Love... your fox, Si.'

1439
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:48,518
- 你在那里吗?- 是的.

1440
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:54,065
- 嘿, 你怎么样了?- 难受的一天.

1441
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,275
发生什么了?

1442
00:44:57,736 --> 00:45:00,154
我在旅馆见到一个客人.

1443
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:02,907
很好强.

1444
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,118
但是留给了我一些可乐.

1445
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:08,287
要被酒吗？

1446
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:11,791
好的.

1447
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:40,570
你知道...

1448
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:44,574
那晚我去酒吧然后说再见

1449
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,118
我看到你和另外一些人在一起?

1450
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:55,001
我知道我不应该这么想,

1451
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:58,296
但这让我感到很奇怪.

1452
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,381
这让你感到奇怪

1453
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,094
我在工作.

1454
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:10,641
你认为人们做事情只是因为喜欢

1455
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,643
而不是因为需要去做?

1456
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:21,194
你知道,这些人大部分...

1457
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:27,742
如果他们撞车了,
我都不会在乎.

1458
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:35,124
他们的老婆呢?

1459
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:38,169
我的意思是, 你有没有想过他们的老婆?

1460
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,379
不,我不是那样想的.

1461
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,049
不...

1462
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:48,429
我的意思是, 想一下, 因为...

1463
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:52,266
这些人大部分都可能结婚了,是吗?

1464
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:56,771
如果他们老婆知道你,然后...

1465
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,983
她们会很不高兴.

1466
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:04,028
- 这会摧毁他们的生活的.- 可能吧.

1467
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:11,327
就拿今晚那个人来说.

1468
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:14,622
他结婚了吗?

1469
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:19,168
是的，他结了.

1470
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:21,128
他有钱吗?

1471
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:23,965
有.

1472
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:29,095
OK, 想象一下.

1473
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:33,850
你的手机... 没有照相机.

1474
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:37,645
但是,如果有的话

1475
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:40,147
你把它放这里.

1476
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,024
你去坐那里.

1477
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:49,949
无论发生什么事...
你都记下来了.

1478
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,871
然后怎样?

1479
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:01,210
然后...

1480
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,841
然后...?

1481
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:16,225
我的意思是,

1482
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:21,397
与其从很多男人

1483
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:24,400
身上的得到一点钱,

1484
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:29,113
你可以从一个男人身上得到很多钱

1485
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:36,913
这些人很好利用的.

1486
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:43,753
你介意我换下音乐吗?

1487
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:45,171
u，继续.

1488
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,716
It was the one thing they didn't take.

1489
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:16,869
When everybody leaves you lonely

1490
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:20,623
And times are worse than sad

1491
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:28,589
And the world is falling
on your head

1492
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:33,552
Just remember, for all you know

1493
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:36,973
Good or bad, come what may

1494
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:41,435
You're gonna live tomorrow

1495
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:46,774
If you don't die today

1496
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:50,319
It takes a muscle to fall in love

1497
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:54,699
It takes a muscle
to fall in love

1498
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:58,703
It takes a muscle to fall in love

1499
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:02,999
Now the fear got in me

1500
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,127
Cutting me deep

1501
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:10,423
That's where it's gonna stay

1502
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:14,593
And never leave

1503
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:19,390
Someone come and lay my worry

1504
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:21,767
Someone come and kill...?

1505
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:28,190
我睡不着.

1506
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,079
你还好吗?

1507
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:52,965
我在想那些家伙.

1508
00:50:58,263 --> 00:50:59,805
他们有妻子.

1509
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:04,643
他们有钱.

1510
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:14,403
我不知道他们住哪里,但是我有他们的号码.

1511
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,825
OK.

1512
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:27,124
那很好.

1513
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:31,170
我们可以一起想办法.

1514
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,597
我去拿电话.

1515
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,726
看一下.

1516
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:52,441
我帮你买了意见衬衫.

1517
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,111
谢谢.

1518
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:57,905
- 你喜欢蓝色吗?- 是的.

1519
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:00,866
我喜欢海军蓝..

1520
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,455
完美. 谢谢你.

1521
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,749
试一下, 想这样.

1522
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:23,222
等一下! 这样子不对.

1523
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:07,224
There was a time when my world was filled with darkness

1524
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,893
DDDarkness

1525
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:13,522
And I stopped dreaming now I'm supposed to fill it up with something

1526
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:15,024
Something, something

1527
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,778
对不起，打扰一下.

1528
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:02,696
你是Jean吗?

1529
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:07,034
- 是的.- 你今晚见到一个女生吗?

1530
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:11,038
什么?

1531
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:15,292
你有Victoria的电话吗?请用你的邮箱发个邮件给她.

1532
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,086
为什么?

1533
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,129
我们有点东西给你看.

1534
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:21,548
我们现在看吧.

1535
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:27,054
不，不好意思.那不可能.

1536
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:31,016
OK.我要书法语了,你能明白吗?

1537
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:34,561
是的，我能明白.

1538
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:36,438
我是个警察.

1539
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:38,482
警察.

1540
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:41,026
明白?

1541
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:42,152
是的.

1542
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:45,030
那意味这我可以,

1543
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:47,283
如果我想...

1544
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:51,620
我可以打爆你的头!

1545
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:54,540
你明白吗?

1546
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:55,916
是的.

1547
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,795
如果我操了个妓女,关你什么事?

1548
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:05,050
你真的的有东西,或者你在耍我?

1549
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:07,594
如果是那样,我要揍你了.

1550
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,263
明白?

1551
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:11,974
对不起. 没事了.忘了它吧.

1552
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:15,686
不!

1553
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,109
停下来.

1554
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:07,988
停.

1555
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:08,257
停.
想试下什么感觉吗?

1556
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:10,008
你就是个累赘!

1557
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:11,802
等下,我来告诉你.

1558
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,345
转过去.

1559
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,102
你喜欢那样吗?

1560
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:21,103
- 是吗?- 是的.

1561
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,563
像那样?

1562
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,148
OK, 过来这里.

1563
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:32,114
这样?

1564
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,657
是的，很好.

1565
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:38,454
- 快点?- Yeah...!

1566
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:01,268
哦, 操.

1567
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,195
操!

1568
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,249
过来.

1569
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:19,137
你还好吗?

1570
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:22,224
- 是的，你呢?- 嗯.

1571
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:55,173
我有没有告诉你我第一次见到一个女人在Boulevard?

1572
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:03,307
我走去Boulevard.我母亲拉着我的手.

1573
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:06,643
我们要去Sacré Coeur.那天是星期天.

1574
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:13,609
那天...

1575
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:17,904
我注意到一个女人在那栋建筑旁学习.

1576
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:24,536
她很大.

1577
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:27,956
她穿这件迷你裙,没有穿袜子.

1578
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:30,459
她看着我.

1579
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:32,336
她很漂亮.

1580
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:35,839
她看着我.

1581
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:43,722
然后用她的手指,像这样给我做了个动作.

1582
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:50,979
她太近了, 我可以闻到她的味道了.

1583
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:56,985
在那时候,我不知道那种味道是什么.

1584
01:00:57,111 --> 01:00:58,153
现在，我知道了.

1585
01:00:58,279 --> 01:00:59,905
性爱.

1586
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:10,499
当我大了一点我去找她,

1587
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:14,670
只是问他,"你想从我这里得到什么?"

1588
01:01:16,297 --> 01:01:18,256
明白吗?

1589
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:22,260
"你想从一个8岁小孩身上得到什么?"

1590
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:35,148
不穿衣服.

1591
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:20,754
René?

1592
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:22,923
是的.

1593
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:25,717
你有Victoria的号码吗?

1594
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:28,136
不好意思?

1595
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,722
有些东西 Victoria想给你看.

1596
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:32,849
请用你的邮箱给她发条信息.

1597
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:35,185
为什么?

1598
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:38,438
她才能给你送段视频过去.我才可以把东西留在你的邮箱.

1599
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:41,733
等一下,等一下,等一下...

1600
01:05:02,106 --> 01:05:03,356
René?

1601
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,903
你在开玩笑.

1602
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:10,655
是吗?

1603
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:15,452
- 你有文件给我吗?- 不，不是现在.

1604
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:22,918
我赚那些钱不容易y.

1605
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:25,670
我有老婆,孩子, 家庭

1606
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:28,882
- 是的，我明白.- 我有责任在身上.

1607
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:33,553
是的. 是的...这不是给我的.是给她的。

1608
01:05:33,846 --> 01:05:35,680
就这样?

1609
01:05:35,806 --> 01:05:38,850
不用闹大了.

1610
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:30,193
- 我应该给你买双鞋子了.- 是的.

1611
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:40,203
- 你要去Métro吗?- 为什么?

1612
01:06:41,622 --> 01:06:43,373
我正想从这里走过去.

1613
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:44,624
- 是吗?- 是的.

1614
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:48,795
- 这里?- 是的.附近有家商店.

1615
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:50,964
- 稍后见... OK?- OK.

1616
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:52,882
- Bye.- Bye, 甜心.

1617
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:58,930
- Bye.- Bye.

1618
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:03,643
你确定你的感觉吗?

1619
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:05,311
看这我的眼睛.

1620
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:08,523
所以?

1621
01:07:08,649 --> 01:07:11,359
这就足够了. 想要被饮料吗?

1622
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:13,695
可乐.

1623
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:22,412
你又从这里经过了...

1624
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:24,122
- 希望是.- 你不会忘记我们吧?

1625
01:07:24,248 --> 01:07:25,707
当然不会.

1626
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:28,251
你留在巴黎吗, 我想?

1627
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:31,379
不，不，我要离开了.

1628
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:33,590
不, 一天一次.

1629
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:35,592
爱情稍纵即逝.

1630
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:38,219
不管什么,我现在感觉好多了.

1631
01:07:38,345 --> 01:07:40,972
为爱情干杯!

1632
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:43,058
我也可以找到爱情吗!

1633
01:08:10,711 --> 01:08:12,045
嘿!

1634
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:18,301
你还...记得我吗?

1635
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:22,388
是的! 是的,我记得你.

1636
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:24,849
是的, Simon.你是...

1637
01:08:24,975 --> 01:08:26,017
Marianne.

1638
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:27,644
Marianne.

1639
01:08:29,814 --> 01:08:32,023
你住这附近?

1640
01:08:32,149 --> 01:08:33,399
是的..

1641
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:35,568
你呢?

1642
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:42,200
-是的...- 我还以为你离开巴黎了.

1643
01:08:42,743 --> 01:08:46,412
我准备离开,但我很喜欢这里

1644
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:49,916
所以我打算待久一点.

1645
01:08:50,042 --> 01:08:52,752
还有... 你住哪里?

1646
01:08:52,878 --> 01:08:55,547
我在附近的旅馆.

1647
01:08:55,673 --> 01:09:00,260
看k.我现在要去见人了,我怎么联系你?

1648
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:02,595
- 你要我的号码?-是的.

1649
01:09:05,432 --> 01:09:07,475
- 你有纸吗?- 有.

1650
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:12,832
看.

1651
01:10:17,254 --> 01:10:19,088
这是你的过错.

1652
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:28,973
是你做这些的.

1653
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:12,475
我做了什么?

1654
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:17,981
- 什么?- 他没有接受那些钱.

1655
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:20,275
OK.

1656
01:11:33,664 --> 01:11:35,540
我可以帮你拿什么?

1657
01:11:42,172 --> 01:11:44,215
这里, 我有些东西给你.

1658
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:50,305
当我还是个小孩的时候

1659
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:53,516
我妈妈给了我这个东西

1660
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:57,687
因为她说,我让她想起一个小狐狸。

1661
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:14,871
我...我经常想成为一只老虎.

1662
01:12:16,081 --> 01:12:17,415
是吗?

1663
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:28,968
我经常认为自己更像一只狮子.

1664
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:33,931
我经常认为自己更像一只狮子.

1665
01:12:50,407 --> 01:12:51,908
你在研究什么?

1666
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:53,368
法国文学.

1667
01:12:53,494 --> 01:12:55,161
- 是吗?- 是的.

1668
01:12:55,287 --> 01:12:56,746
OK. 那个时期的?

1669
01:12:56,872 --> 01:12:58,831
中世纪的还有文艺复兴.

1670
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:02,543
你是学什么的?

1671
01:13:02,669 --> 01:13:06,172
我毕业了,这年的早些时候.

1672
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:08,508
但是我是学神经系统学的.

1673
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:11,928
我是研究眼睛和大脑的关系的.

1674
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:15,348
我的这些项目是关于周围视觉的.

1675
01:13:15,474 --> 01:13:18,434
它是通过 'crowding'和 'size pooling'来处理的.

1676
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:23,398
一个物体有多宽是由周围物体加权平均决定的.

1677
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:25,358
它叫做'size pooling'.

1678
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:28,611
无论怎样, 很无聊, 我知道.

1679
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:32,907
但是它被出版了, 实际上.

1680
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:36,285
你现在在巴黎做什么?

1681
01:13:38,455 --> 01:13:40,039
实话实说?

1682
01:13:40,165 --> 01:13:41,582
是的.

1683
01:13:42,292 --> 01:13:45,378
没事情做. 我...

1684
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:48,881
我来这里有段时间没事情做.

1685
01:13:50,175 --> 01:13:51,467
OK.

1686
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:55,471
- 你介意我问你些东西吗?- 不.

1687
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:58,933
我很好奇...

1688
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:03,104
你的眼睛...为什么会这样移动.

1689
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:04,188
是的...

1690
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:08,901
从我父亲那里遗传的.

1691
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:13,114
这叫做"眼球震颤."

1692
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,199
- 眼球震颤.- 是的.

1693
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:18,411
OK. 我不知道在英语里面叫什么.

1694
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:19,912
是的.

1695
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:25,835
对不起. 我不是想让你尴尬. 这很...

1696
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:29,714
很迷人,实际上.

1697
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,175
谢谢. 我很好.

1698
01:14:33,093 --> 01:14:35,470
我的意思是.这很好看.

1699
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:37,930
谢谢.

1700
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:19,430
- Simon?- 是的.

1701
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:22,558
你在哪里?

1702
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:24,644
我在帮我们买食物.

1703
01:15:26,563 --> 01:15:29,023
W你为什么出去那么久?

1704
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:32,401
是的，我...我感到很抱歉.

1705
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:34,362
我去散步了.

1706
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:41,035
你还好吗?

1707
01:15:57,010 --> 01:16:00,054
听着. 明天,我需要些钱

1708
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:02,306
因为我需要给你买些东西.

1709
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:09,772
你在做什么?

1710
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:18,114
和我做爱.

1711
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:20,866
Oh, no, no, no, no...

1712
01:17:47,746 --> 01:17:50,873
'René.毕一声后给我留下信息.'

1713
01:17:50,999 --> 01:17:53,876
嘿, René, 又是我.

1714
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:57,463
停着. 我也不想这么快打给你, 但是...

1715
01:17:57,589 --> 01:17:59,423
我们要谈谈更多的钱.

1716
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:04,720
我会一直打给你知道我找到你. 还有, OK...

1717
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:06,222
谢谢, 再见.

1718
01:18:19,861 --> 01:18:21,737
'René. 留下...'

1719
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:28,661
René. 在毕一声后留下信息.

1720
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:36,293
René. 在毕一声后留下信息.

1721
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:39,755
René, 当我打给你的时候拿起你的手机.

1722
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:05,531
Walking up to me expecting

1723
01:19:05,657 --> 01:19:09,201
Walking up to me expecting words

1724
01:19:09,327 --> 01:19:11,162
It happens all the time

1725
01:19:12,956 --> 01:19:15,332
Present company accepted

1726
01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:18,502
Present company except the worst

1727
01:19:19,045 --> 01:19:20,963
It happens every night

1728
01:19:26,511 --> 01:19:30,473
Present company
excluded in every way

1729
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:37,855
Present company

1730
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:40,649
Makes me wanna stay

1731
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:59,376
Killing it with close inspection

1732
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:02,463
Killing it can only make it worse

1733
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:05,007
It sort of makes it breed

1734
01:20:06,843 --> 01:20:09,178
Present company accepting

1735
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:11,972
Presently we all expect the worst

1736
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:14,892
Works just like a need

1737
01:20:20,398 --> 01:20:22,066
Present company

1738
01:20:22,776 --> 01:20:24,652
Included in the fight

1739
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:08,779
Don't you want me to wake up?

1740
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:12,491
Then give me just a bit of your...?

1741
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:22,793
我可以看这你吗?

1742
01:21:22,919 --> 01:21:25,129
- 可以.- 是吗?

1743
01:21:52,282 --> 01:21:54,116
我不喜欢这样.

1744
01:21:56,202 --> 01:21:59,246
- 什么?- 你看我的方式.

1745
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:05,169
为什么?你很漂亮.

1746
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:06,545
来这里.

1747
01:22:53,593 --> 01:22:56,261

1748
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:11,735
- 我们该去哪里?- Montmartre.

1749
01:23:28,962 --> 01:23:30,546
天哪... 对不起.

1750
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:32,339
他是谁

1751
01:23:32,465 --> 01:23:36,427
只是我的...我一起住的表兄.

1752
01:23:40,306 --> 01:23:41,390
什么?

1753
01:23:41,516 --> 01:23:45,060
不...我以为你住在旅馆的.

1754
01:23:45,979 --> 01:23:47,021
什么t?

1755
01:23:47,147 --> 01:23:48,939
是的,你这样告诉我的.

1756
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:53,986
不... 我刚来的时候住旅馆. 现在我和表兄住了.

1757
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:58,782
但是他一直打给我...

1758
01:23:58,908 --> 01:24:02,494
还有, 以防是重要的事情,我应该和他说话.

1759
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:05,080
可以帮我付下帐吗,帮我点多被咖啡?

1760
01:24:05,206 --> 01:24:06,582
- 好的.- 谢谢.

1761
01:24:09,627 --> 01:24:11,837
嘿...一切好吗?

1762
01:24:11,963 --> 01:24:14,673
你昨晚为什么不回家?'

1763
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:18,385
我... 我知道.

1764
01:24:18,511 --> 01:24:20,804
在外面过夜很抱歉.

1765
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:23,182
'你和谁一起?'

1766
01:24:23,308 --> 01:24:25,559
一个朋友.

1767
01:24:25,685 --> 01:24:27,061
'什么朋友?'

1768
01:24:27,937 --> 01:24:32,357
听着. 我现在不能说,但是不用担心.我很快回去.

1769
01:24:38,948 --> 01:24:41,533
- 你还好吗?- 是的.

1770
01:24:41,659 --> 01:24:45,204
我的父母,他们很担心我.

1771
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:47,414
他们一直打给我表兄.

1772
01:24:48,458 --> 01:24:50,709
我一星期没和他们说话了.

1773
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:56,590
-但是你父母离婚了.- 什么?

1774
01:24:58,259 --> 01:25:00,719
你告诉我你父母离婚了.

1775
01:25:00,845 --> 01:25:04,723
是的, 他们离婚了.我意思是,我母亲和我继父.

1776
01:25:04,849 --> 01:25:07,142
但是我母亲重婚了.我有一个继父.

1777
01:25:10,897 --> 01:25:12,481
等一下.

1778
01:25:13,691 --> 01:25:17,486
- 你好, René?- '不.谁?'

1779
01:25:17,695 --> 01:25:21,657
- 对不起.你死、是谁?- 'Mathilde.

1780

'你之前有打过René'的电话吗?'

1781
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:27,913
我... 是的, 我可以和René谈话吗?

1782
01:25:28,039 --> 01:25:30,707
'不, 你不能和René谈话.'

1783
01:25:32,502 --> 01:25:35,003
- 抱歉, 你说什么?- René'死了.

1784
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:39,258
'告诉我你为什么打René'的电话这么多次.'

1785
01:25:39,843 --> 01:25:43,929
听着,现在我过得不好.可以叫René打给我吗?

1786
01:25:44,347 --> 01:25:45,973
现在不行,先生!

1787
01:25:50,436 --> 01:25:53,480
对不起. 这家伙...天哪!

1788
01:25:55,316 --> 01:25:57,025
你还好吗?

1789
01:25:57,402 --> 01:26:00,320
是的, 我很好.我只是今天不好.

1790
01:26:03,783 --> 01:26:05,909
和你喝咖啡很有趣!

1791
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:07,411
什么?

1792
01:26:07,537 --> 01:26:09,371
只是开玩笑.

1793
01:26:09,497 --> 01:26:12,082
- 什么意思?- 没有! 只是开玩笑.

1794
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:15,294
天哪!

1795
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:16,962
你知道上呢么,对不起. 我...

1796
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:19,047
-如果你要走的话, 走吧.- 我...

1797
01:26:19,966 --> 01:26:23,135
我没钱了.我到时候还你?

1798
01:26:23,261 --> 01:26:24,386
好的.

1799
01:26:24,971 --> 01:26:26,388
我很高兴.

1800
01:26:27,724 --> 01:26:29,558
OK, 我会打给你的.

1801
01:26:30,768 --> 01:26:32,603
抱歉.

1802
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:56,376
我今天有个电话

1803
01:26:56,502 --> 01:26:58,587
来自一个女人.

1804
01:27:00,632 --> 01:27:02,674
然后我认为我们要跑了e.

1805
01:27:04,093 --> 01:27:06,011
你昨晚去哪里了?

1806
01:27:07,972 --> 01:27:09,806
你为什么不回家?

1807
01:27:11,976 --> 01:27:13,769
我告诉你了.

1808
01:27:14,562 --> 01:27:16,063
我出去了.

1809
01:27:18,816 --> 01:27:20,108
听着

1810
01:27:22,403 --> 01:27:25,864
我们要尽快走.

1811
01:27:46,636 --> 01:27:48,428
你让我很反感.

1812
01:27:50,598 --> 01:27:53,809
你听到我说什么了吗?我们要走了.

1813
01:27:55,979 --> 01:27:57,688
滚出去.

1814
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:02,484
你就是一坨屎.

1815
01:28:03,361 --> 01:28:04,903
你还说谎.

1816
01:28:05,029 --> 01:28:08,407
- 你说法语的时候我听不懂.- 你个骗子.

1817
01:28:10,994 --> 01:28:12,077
好吧.

1818
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:17,291
我走了.

1819
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:20,627
很好,走吧.你真让人可怜.

1820
01:28:20,753 --> 01:28:22,879
拿上你的钱.

1821
01:28:23,006 --> 01:28:24,673
拿着.

1822
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:26,800
我不需要你的钱.

1823
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:33,557
看看你自己, 看...

1824
01:28:33,683 --> 01:28:35,392
你是一个懦夫.
