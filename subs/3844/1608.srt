1
00:00:59,513 --> 00:01:00,946
German bandits at two o'clock!

2
00:01:01,114 --> 00:01:02,479
Increase throttle! Power dive!

3
00:01:08,288 --> 00:01:10,552
Spell it right, Rafe.

4
00:01:10,591 --> 00:01:14,083
"Rudder" is spelled with two Ds.

5
00:01:14,127 --> 00:01:16,095
Thanks, wingman.

6
00:01:17,331 --> 00:01:18,628
Whoa, bandits!

7
00:01:20,801 --> 00:01:22,068
Crack shootin', Danny.

8
00:01:22,135 --> 00:01:23,205
Crack shootin', Rafe.

9
00:01:23,303 --> 00:01:25,294
- Land of the free.
- Home of the brave.

10
00:01:44,691 --> 00:01:47,159
Great flyin', Dad!

11
00:01:49,262 --> 00:01:51,162
Come on.
I'm gonna teach you how to fly.

12
00:01:58,338 --> 00:02:01,034
- I get the front!
- No, you take the back.

13
00:02:01,074 --> 00:02:03,269
I'm bigger,
and I should be in front.

14
00:02:03,309 --> 00:02:05,573
I'm older,
and I'm teachin', so no.

15
00:02:05,612 --> 00:02:07,546
Wow.
It's like we're really flying.

16
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,447
Yeah, I did it lots of times.
Come on, you man the guns.

17
00:02:10,483 --> 00:02:11,916
I'll give her some throttle.

18
00:02:11,951 --> 00:02:13,942
We gotta get those
dirty German bandits.

19
00:02:18,925 --> 00:02:20,893
Oh, gosh!

20
00:02:26,866 --> 00:02:29,494
- Hang on!
- Make it stop, Rafe!

21
00:02:31,537 --> 00:02:33,164
I've seen my dad
do this lots of times.

22
00:02:33,206 --> 00:02:34,901
Don't worry!

23
00:02:39,846 --> 00:02:42,610
Oh, my gosh! We're flying!

24
00:02:42,649 --> 00:02:44,514
We're flying!

25
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,494
My dad's gonna kill me.

26
00:03:02,535 --> 00:03:05,163
Come on.

27
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,100
We flew!

28
00:03:09,142 --> 00:03:11,167
We flew! Yes!
I'm a pilot!

29
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,871
- I know!
- Yeah!

30
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:16,243
We flew.

31
00:03:16,282 --> 00:03:18,011
- You no-account boy!
- Daddy...

32
00:03:18,051 --> 00:03:19,780
I done told you,
you spend time playing...

33
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:22,014
with this stupid boy
can't read...

34
00:03:22,055 --> 00:03:23,716
you ain't never goin'
to amount to nothin'!

35
00:03:23,756 --> 00:03:26,452
He ain't stupid, Daddy!

36
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:31,128
Come on!

37
00:03:32,999 --> 00:03:35,832
Get on back home. Now!

38
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:39,803
Get on up.

39
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:41,534
You got work to do.

40
00:03:41,574 --> 00:03:44,202
Come on, get on home!

41
00:03:46,546 --> 00:03:48,571
You let him alone!

42
00:03:49,882 --> 00:03:51,713
Daddy, no!

43
00:03:51,751 --> 00:03:54,151
I will bust you open,
you dirty German!

44
00:03:54,187 --> 00:03:56,655
What'd you call me?

45
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:01,552
I fought the Germans in France.

46
00:04:01,594 --> 00:04:05,587
And I fought 'em
in the trenches.

47
00:04:05,631 --> 00:04:07,792
And I pray to God
no one ever has to see...

48
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:09,199
the things that I saw.

49
00:04:25,585 --> 00:04:28,179
You're my best friend.

50
00:04:29,922 --> 00:04:32,083
Daddy, wait!

51
00:04:42,468 --> 00:04:43,696
Adolf Hitler...

52
00:04:43,736 --> 00:04:45,761
builds the German
military machine...

53
00:04:45,805 --> 00:04:47,898
and drags all of Europe
into war.

54
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,306
But even while France
falls to Hitler...

55
00:04:50,343 --> 00:04:53,107
America still refuses
to join the fighting.

56
00:05:11,364 --> 00:05:13,457
- Where's McCawley and Walker?
- Still training, sir.

57
00:05:15,134 --> 00:05:17,261
All right, Danny.
Now let's show 'em how to fly.

58
00:05:17,303 --> 00:05:18,702
We're gonna play chicken.
You ready?

59
00:05:18,738 --> 00:05:21,070
This ain't the farm,
and these ain't no cropdusters.

60
00:05:21,107 --> 00:05:22,267
I'm not playing
chicken with you.

61
00:05:22,308 --> 00:05:23,798
Now don't be a baby.
I'll tell you what...

62
00:05:23,843 --> 00:05:26,243
- I'm not doing it, Rafe.
- I'm coming right at you.

63
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,974
You can turn, or you can hit me.
It's up to you.

64
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,110
What the...

65
00:05:32,151 --> 00:05:33,345
Oh, boy.

66
00:05:36,622 --> 00:05:38,988
Why you always
bustin' my ass, Rafe?

67
00:05:39,025 --> 00:05:40,322
Which way you goin'?

68
00:05:42,228 --> 00:05:44,992
I guess I'll go right.
No, left. I'll go left.

69
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,595
OK, we're goin' left, right?

70
00:05:48,634 --> 00:05:49,965
Right. Right?

71
00:05:50,002 --> 00:05:52,095
Right like we're goin' right,
or right like we're goin' left?

72
00:05:52,138 --> 00:05:53,696
Well, now you got me
all mixed up!

73
00:05:53,739 --> 00:05:55,764
I don't know.
Make up your mind.

74
00:05:58,077 --> 00:06:01,046
God, Rafe, we're going right!
Righty-tighty!

75
00:06:10,756 --> 00:06:12,781
Those are some smooth aces.

76
00:06:12,825 --> 00:06:14,952
Did you say something?

77
00:06:14,994 --> 00:06:17,224
'Cause let me tell ya,
those farm boys are grounded!

78
00:06:17,263 --> 00:06:19,561
Yes, sir, an entirely
unacceptable use...

79
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:22,295
of m-military aircraft, sir.

80
00:06:23,703 --> 00:06:25,227
- Get my hat.
- Yes, sir.

81
00:06:25,271 --> 00:06:28,331
Get those hedge-hoppers
in Doolittle's office.

82
00:06:28,374 --> 00:06:30,740
After two years of training...

83
00:06:30,776 --> 00:06:33,142
you believe that
a $45,000 airplane...

84
00:06:33,179 --> 00:06:34,669
is there for your amusement?

85
00:06:34,714 --> 00:06:37,308
No, sir. I was just trying
to keep my edge, Major.

86
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,181
And when you did
the outside loop last week...

87
00:06:39,218 --> 00:06:41,686
what did you think that was?
Honing your skills?

88
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:42,983
That's not training, McCawley.

89
00:06:43,022 --> 00:06:44,284
That's a stunt.

90
00:06:44,323 --> 00:06:46,587
And I personally
consider it to be reckless...

91
00:06:46,626 --> 00:06:50,118
and irresponsible.

92
00:06:50,162 --> 00:06:51,356
Major...

93
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:55,330
How could that be,
when you're famous...

94
00:06:55,368 --> 00:06:57,097
for being the first man
in the world ever to do it?

95
00:06:57,136 --> 00:06:58,296
Don't get cute with me, son.

96
00:06:58,337 --> 00:07:00,805
No, sir, I don't mean
to be disrespectful.

97
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,638
I just think that...

98
00:07:03,676 --> 00:07:04,870
It is reckless
and irresponsible...

99
00:07:04,911 --> 00:07:06,173
if you're just doing it
to be a show-off.

100
00:07:06,212 --> 00:07:09,875
But I was doing it to try
to inspire the men, sir...

101
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,247
in the way that
you've inspired me.

102
00:07:11,284 --> 00:07:13,411
I believe the French
even have a word for that...

103
00:07:13,452 --> 00:07:15,283
when the men get together
to honor their leaders.

104
00:07:15,321 --> 00:07:16,686
They call it an homage, sir.

105
00:07:16,722 --> 00:07:18,587
- A what?
- An homage, sir.

106
00:07:18,624 --> 00:07:20,285
That's bullshit, McCawley!

107
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:26,689
But it's very,
very good bullshit.

108
00:07:26,732 --> 00:07:27,926
Thank you, sir.

109
00:07:30,736 --> 00:07:34,399
McCawley, you remind me
of myself fifteen years ago.

110
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,431
Which is why we need
to discuss this.

111
00:07:36,475 --> 00:07:38,466
Have a seat, son.

112
00:07:46,185 --> 00:07:49,018
The British have accepted you
into the Eagle Squadron.

113
00:07:49,055 --> 00:07:51,455
You're on your way
to England tomorrow...

114
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,617
if you still want to go.

115
00:07:56,162 --> 00:07:58,130
Just a few British pilots
are all that stand...

116
00:07:58,164 --> 00:08:00,530
between Hitler
and total victory in Europe.

117
00:08:00,566 --> 00:08:02,591
They're gonna need
all the help they can get.

118
00:08:02,635 --> 00:08:04,102
Yes, sir. I'm on my way.

119
00:08:04,136 --> 00:08:06,502
Just for the record...

120
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:08,439
I'm supposed to ask you
to reconsider.

121
00:08:08,474 --> 00:08:10,032
Sir?

122
00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:12,044
Sooner or later
we're gonna be in this war...

123
00:08:12,078 --> 00:08:14,069
whether we like it or not.

124
00:08:14,113 --> 00:08:16,445
And I'm gonna need
all of my best pilots.

125
00:08:16,482 --> 00:08:19,315
So it's my duty
to ask you to stay.

126
00:08:19,352 --> 00:08:22,515
Major, what would you do?

127
00:08:24,857 --> 00:08:26,586
If it was me...

128
00:08:28,861 --> 00:08:30,829
I'd go.

129
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,330
Get out. Am I going bald
right back here?

130
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,799
Man, I am one good-lookin'
son of a bitch.

131
00:08:37,837 --> 00:08:39,464
Don't you ever die.

132
00:08:39,505 --> 00:08:42,133
Die. That's exactly...

133
00:08:42,174 --> 00:08:45,234
the concept
you gotta work tonight.

134
00:08:45,277 --> 00:08:48,713
You put a drop of this clove oil
under your eyes...

135
00:08:48,748 --> 00:08:50,773
and you let 'em sting
and well up.

136
00:08:50,816 --> 00:08:54,183
You get your nurse alone,
take a breath...

137
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,620
let her see your eyes glisten...

138
00:08:56,656 --> 00:09:01,093
and say, "Baby,
they're training me for war...

139
00:09:01,127 --> 00:09:04,028
"and I don't know
what'll happen...

140
00:09:04,063 --> 00:09:07,328
"but if I die tomorrow,
I want to know...

141
00:09:07,366 --> 00:09:11,393
"that we lived
all we could tonight."

142
00:09:11,437 --> 00:09:13,405
Come on, guys!
We got nurses waitin'.

143
00:09:13,439 --> 00:09:16,272
Come on, before the rest
of his hair falls out.

144
00:09:16,308 --> 00:09:19,766
How could you do this?

145
00:09:19,812 --> 00:09:21,336
Doolittle assigned me.

146
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,645
He wanted me to get
some real combat training in.

147
00:09:24,684 --> 00:09:25,844
Guess what?

148
00:09:25,885 --> 00:09:28,080
It's not training over there.
It's war.

149
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,384
Where the losers die,
and there aren't any winners...

150
00:09:30,423 --> 00:09:31,617
just guys who turn
into broken-down wrecks...

151
00:09:31,657 --> 00:09:32,817
like my father.

152
00:09:32,858 --> 00:09:34,086
I understand that, Danny.

153
00:09:34,126 --> 00:09:35,423
But I feel like
I got a duty to go.

154
00:09:35,461 --> 00:09:37,520
Don't preach to me
about duty, damn it.

155
00:09:37,563 --> 00:09:39,394
I wear the same uniform you do.

156
00:09:39,432 --> 00:09:42,265
Now, if trouble wants me,
I'm ready for it.

157
00:09:42,301 --> 00:09:43,461
But why go looking for it?

158
00:09:43,502 --> 00:09:45,629
God, Danny, come on.

159
00:09:45,671 --> 00:09:48,071
I'm gonna be twenty-five.
I might as well be an old man.

160
00:09:48,107 --> 00:09:50,166
They're gonna have me bein'
a flight instructor.

161
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:52,643
I don't wanna teach loops
and barrel rolls.

162
00:09:52,678 --> 00:09:54,009
I wanna be a combat fighter.

163
00:09:54,046 --> 00:09:55,206
Hey, come on!

164
00:09:55,247 --> 00:09:58,410
The nurses can't
d-dance by themselves.

165
00:09:58,451 --> 00:10:00,214
Let's go.

166
00:10:09,261 --> 00:10:12,025
If the call of duty
means seeing 150 men...

167
00:10:12,064 --> 00:10:14,897
in their underwear every day,
we are here to serve.

168
00:10:16,135 --> 00:10:17,363
I can't believe it.

169
00:10:17,403 --> 00:10:19,428
Saturday night in New York City.

170
00:10:19,472 --> 00:10:21,133
Do you know what they're doing
where I come from?

171
00:10:21,173 --> 00:10:22,606
Nothing.

172
00:10:22,641 --> 00:10:24,438
Cow-tipping.

173
00:10:24,477 --> 00:10:25,705
Well, that's why
you joined the Navy, hon'.

174
00:10:25,745 --> 00:10:27,975
To get out of that dusty
little town and see the world.

175
00:10:28,013 --> 00:10:30,675
May I remind you, Barbara,
we're Navy nurses, not tourists.

176
00:10:30,716 --> 00:10:33,514
I joined to do
my patriotic duty and...

177
00:10:33,552 --> 00:10:35,747
to meet guys.

178
00:10:35,788 --> 00:10:37,221
Me, too.

179
00:10:37,256 --> 00:10:38,985
Girls, we're gonna have
so much fun tonight in the city.

180
00:10:39,024 --> 00:10:40,548
You've gotta tell them
the story, Evelyn.

181
00:10:40,593 --> 00:10:42,493
What?

182
00:10:42,528 --> 00:10:43,756
Oh, come on. Tell us.

183
00:10:43,796 --> 00:10:45,320
It's such a long story.

184
00:10:45,364 --> 00:10:47,332
We got time.

185
00:10:47,366 --> 00:10:49,231
I saw it happen.

186
00:10:49,268 --> 00:10:50,895
Well, it was
about four weeks ago...

187
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,629
What do you think is b-better?

188
00:10:53,672 --> 00:10:56,072
All in the one cheek,
or spreading them out?

189
00:10:58,544 --> 00:11:00,910
Fusco, Anthony.

190
00:11:05,651 --> 00:11:07,516
You all right, buddy?

191
00:11:07,553 --> 00:11:09,783
Sweetie, do you really
have to do this?

192
00:11:09,822 --> 00:11:12,882
I'm not gonna get yellow fever
in my barracks.

193
00:11:12,925 --> 00:11:15,917
No? If you'd rather,
she can do it.

194
00:11:20,466 --> 00:11:22,832
Whoa. Just gimme a minute.

195
00:11:22,868 --> 00:11:26,201
Honey, the government
says stick 'em, we stick 'em.

196
00:11:30,442 --> 00:11:31,875
Red, you all right?

197
00:11:34,313 --> 00:11:37,680
Eye exam number four?

198
00:11:37,716 --> 00:11:41,345
Listen, Doc, I have passed
a dozen medical checks.

199
00:11:41,387 --> 00:11:43,617
You write that,
they won't let me fly.

200
00:11:43,656 --> 00:11:46,124
Sorry, son.

201
00:11:46,158 --> 00:11:47,591
I'm gonna fail.

202
00:11:47,626 --> 00:11:49,253
They're gonna
take my wings away.

203
00:11:49,295 --> 00:11:51,559
No, they won't. Just relax.

204
00:11:51,597 --> 00:11:53,155
Read the bottom line, please.

205
00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:54,530
Just keep practicin'
the bottom line.

206
00:11:54,567 --> 00:11:56,398
And don't worry.
I'm right behind you.

207
00:11:56,435 --> 00:11:59,233
J-L-M-K-P-O...

208
00:12:03,108 --> 00:12:04,700
Next.

209
00:12:04,743 --> 00:12:06,176
Ma'am.

210
00:12:09,215 --> 00:12:12,207
J-L-M-K-P-O-E-T-X.

211
00:12:12,251 --> 00:12:13,718
Eyes like an eagle, ma'am.

212
00:12:13,752 --> 00:12:15,652
Slow down, flyboy.

213
00:12:15,688 --> 00:12:18,418
And, instead of the bottom,
read the very top. Both eyes.

214
00:12:18,457 --> 00:12:21,585
Yeah.

215
00:12:21,627 --> 00:12:25,063
"C"...sorry, "J."

216
00:12:25,097 --> 00:12:27,065
"C"...

217
00:12:27,099 --> 00:12:28,361
- "W."
- "W."

218
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,664
- "Q."
- "Q."

219
00:12:30,703 --> 00:12:32,432
"Q."

220
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,201
Read the bottom line
again, please.

221
00:12:37,243 --> 00:12:41,270
But read it right to left
and every other letter.

222
00:12:47,987 --> 00:12:49,614
"E."

223
00:12:49,655 --> 00:12:52,249
"X."

224
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,623
- X-E.
- X-E.

225
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,060
X-E, ma'am.

226
00:12:57,096 --> 00:12:59,724
Ma'am, I know how this looks.

227
00:12:59,765 --> 00:13:01,460
I'm sorry, Lieutenant,
I really am.

228
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,627
But Army and Navy
requires 20/20 vision.

229
00:13:03,669 --> 00:13:06,365
Oh, I... it's not a problem
with my eyes.

230
00:13:06,405 --> 00:13:07,633
I can see.

231
00:13:07,673 --> 00:13:09,470
I can hit a running rabbit
with a $3.00 pistol.

232
00:13:09,508 --> 00:13:11,066
I got a problem with letters,
that's all.

233
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,702
Well, maybe after
some schooling...

234
00:13:12,745 --> 00:13:14,372
you could come back
and take the test again.

235
00:13:14,413 --> 00:13:15,675
No, I had schooling.

236
00:13:15,714 --> 00:13:17,045
The teachers just never knew...

237
00:13:17,082 --> 00:13:19,050
what to make of it.
It's just letters.

238
00:13:19,084 --> 00:13:20,574
I mix 'em up sometimes.
That's all.

239
00:13:20,619 --> 00:13:23,952
I just get 'em
backward sometimes.

240
00:13:23,989 --> 00:13:27,425
Look here.
My math and spacial reasoning...

241
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:28,858
and my verbal scores
are all excellent.

242
00:13:28,894 --> 00:13:30,725
But you barely passed
the written exam.

243
00:13:30,763 --> 00:13:32,924
Yeah, but he did pass it.
So, is it my turn now?

244
00:13:32,965 --> 00:13:36,298
- No, you'll wait your turn.
- Yes, ma'am.

245
00:13:36,335 --> 00:13:38,599
Ma'am, I'm never gonna
be an English teacher.

246
00:13:38,637 --> 00:13:41,128
But I know why I'm here.

247
00:13:41,173 --> 00:13:42,697
To be a pilot.

248
00:13:42,741 --> 00:13:44,402
And you don't dogfight
with manuals.

249
00:13:44,443 --> 00:13:46,434
You don't fly with gauges.

250
00:13:46,478 --> 00:13:47,775
I mean, it's all about
feeling and speed...

251
00:13:47,813 --> 00:13:49,178
and lettin' that plane
become like a part...

252
00:13:49,214 --> 00:13:50,806
of your body.
And that manual...

253
00:13:50,849 --> 00:13:53,147
says that a guy who's a slow
reader can't be a good pilot.

254
00:13:53,185 --> 00:13:55,244
That file says I'm
the best pilot in this room.

255
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:04,191
Ma'am, please,
don't take my wings.

256
00:14:05,831 --> 00:14:07,628
Well, I felt so bad.

257
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:10,464
Evelyn, rotate to station three.

258
00:14:10,502 --> 00:14:11,833
I had no choice.

259
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,895
I passed him.

260
00:14:13,939 --> 00:14:15,270
Good.

261
00:14:15,307 --> 00:14:18,242
So, then this cocky pilot
comes back.

262
00:14:18,277 --> 00:14:20,575
- Say, fella, are you enlisted?
- Yeah.

263
00:14:20,612 --> 00:14:22,739
"Yeah"? Boy,
you're talking to an officer.

264
00:14:22,781 --> 00:14:24,078
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

265
00:14:24,116 --> 00:14:25,378
- Give me that file.
- Yes, sir.

266
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:27,783
- Parade rest.
- Yes, sir.

267
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,549
Ma'am, I didn't get
a chance to thank you.

268
00:14:29,588 --> 00:14:30,850
Drop your skivvies.

269
00:14:33,926 --> 00:14:36,724
Just like this?

270
00:14:36,762 --> 00:14:38,593
That's fine.

271
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:41,326
He did have a very cute butt.

272
00:14:41,367 --> 00:14:44,268
I know you didn't
have to pass me, and you did.

273
00:14:44,303 --> 00:14:47,101
I didn't think
you'd understand, and you did.

274
00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:49,801
You know, you still
haven't said thank you.

275
00:14:49,842 --> 00:14:51,002
Thank you.

276
00:14:51,043 --> 00:14:53,068
You're welcome.

277
00:14:53,112 --> 00:14:56,104
Why'd you do it?
I mean, I'm just curious.

278
00:14:56,148 --> 00:14:57,911
You're like my hero now.

279
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,781
Actually, my father was a pilot.

280
00:14:59,818 --> 00:15:02,150
And I've seen first-hand
what happens...

281
00:15:02,187 --> 00:15:03,814
when a pilot loses his wings.

282
00:15:03,856 --> 00:15:05,016
You know what?

283
00:15:05,057 --> 00:15:07,389
Your father's my hero,
then, too.

284
00:15:07,426 --> 00:15:10,987
In fact, as an officer,
I think it'd by my duty...

285
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,396
to take my new hero's
daughter out tonight...

286
00:15:13,432 --> 00:15:15,730
Just to...

287
00:15:15,768 --> 00:15:17,167
Gosh, did I poke too deep?

288
00:15:17,202 --> 00:15:19,864
I think you hit the bone there.

289
00:15:21,306 --> 00:15:22,705
You are so mean.

290
00:15:24,943 --> 00:15:27,605
What? So is there any chance...

291
00:15:27,646 --> 00:15:32,583
that you might, kind of,
sort of like me, or...

292
00:15:32,618 --> 00:15:36,850
How did you guess?

293
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:38,413
They never taught us...

294
00:15:38,457 --> 00:15:40,925
how to deal with this...
feeling.

295
00:15:43,295 --> 00:15:45,229
What feeling?

296
00:15:45,264 --> 00:15:48,597
Well, it's kind of like... this.

297
00:15:50,302 --> 00:15:53,100
Well, he was getting fresh,
so I poked him again.

298
00:15:54,473 --> 00:15:57,772
All right, Romeo.
I want to get this over with.

299
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,040
Hold on a second.

300
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,171
Miss...

301
00:16:01,213 --> 00:16:03,579
I really, really lick you.

302
00:16:05,584 --> 00:16:07,142
What did he mean?

303
00:16:07,186 --> 00:16:08,915
Like you.

304
00:16:08,954 --> 00:16:10,216
I didn't mean to say that.

305
00:16:10,255 --> 00:16:11,517
And I just...

306
00:16:11,557 --> 00:16:13,957
I just want to ask you, please,
if I can donate dinner.

307
00:16:13,992 --> 00:16:16,119
He started to act very strange.

308
00:16:16,161 --> 00:16:19,153
Or, well, buy you dinner.

309
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:20,790
This isn't your chart.

310
00:16:22,968 --> 00:16:27,064
No. That's the...
this fellow over here's.

311
00:16:27,106 --> 00:16:28,266
I think he left.

312
00:16:28,307 --> 00:16:29,968
Have you already had this shot?

313
00:16:30,008 --> 00:16:32,909
Yeah, once... already.

314
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:36,670
I wanted...
I mean, can I ask you out?

315
00:16:36,715 --> 00:16:38,774
No!

316
00:16:38,817 --> 00:16:40,978
And he just went wham!

317
00:16:44,656 --> 00:16:47,022
What'd you do to him?

318
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:49,755
Poor guy.

319
00:16:56,135 --> 00:16:57,602
Oh, my God.
Are you OK?

320
00:16:57,636 --> 00:17:01,333
Yeah. I'm fine.
I feel great.

321
00:17:01,373 --> 00:17:05,833
This is just standard
precautionary... thing.

322
00:17:05,878 --> 00:17:09,370
Look, I got some
genuine French champagne...

323
00:17:09,414 --> 00:17:10,642
from France.

324
00:17:10,682 --> 00:17:13,378
I thought, you know,
maybe we could celebrate.

325
00:17:13,418 --> 00:17:14,783
Celebrate what?

326
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:19,621
I don't know.
You being my hero, for one.

327
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,888
OK. Why not?

328
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,990
I wanted to thank you.

329
00:17:30,035 --> 00:17:31,832
And I just wanted to...

330
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:34,395
put your mind at ease
about passing me...

331
00:17:34,439 --> 00:17:37,567
because I really do think
you did this country a service.

332
00:17:37,609 --> 00:17:41,045
I am a great flier.

333
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:44,071
And if you have a fault,
which you obviously don't...

334
00:17:44,116 --> 00:17:46,744
it's modesty.

335
00:17:46,785 --> 00:17:50,721
No. If I have a fault,
it's candor.

336
00:17:52,124 --> 00:17:54,183
You are just so...

337
00:17:56,295 --> 00:17:59,355
Cork just got away from me.

338
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,798
God, it hurts.

339
00:18:09,841 --> 00:18:13,538
It hurts something fierce.

340
00:18:13,579 --> 00:18:14,773
I'm sorry.

341
00:18:14,813 --> 00:18:16,371
It's bleeding.

342
00:18:16,415 --> 00:18:18,542
God.

343
00:18:18,584 --> 00:18:20,643
Lay still.

344
00:18:20,686 --> 00:18:21,846
I ruined everything.

345
00:18:21,887 --> 00:18:23,252
- Lay still.
- Oh, it hurts.

346
00:18:23,288 --> 00:18:25,415
- It's cold.
- It'll stop the bleeding.

347
00:18:25,457 --> 00:18:27,084
I can't breathe.

348
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,719
Lay still.

349
00:18:33,632 --> 00:18:35,964
You are so beautiful it hurts.

350
00:18:36,001 --> 00:18:39,164
It's your nose that hurts.

351
00:18:39,204 --> 00:18:42,605
No. I think it's my heart.

352
00:18:50,148 --> 00:18:53,083
And then I kissed him.

353
00:18:53,118 --> 00:18:55,609
Oh, Evelyn.

354
00:18:55,654 --> 00:18:58,316
That's the most romantic story
I ever heard.

355
00:18:58,357 --> 00:19:03,954
It's been the most romantic four
weeks and two days of my life.

356
00:19:03,996 --> 00:19:05,827
I'm so jealous.

357
00:19:25,183 --> 00:19:26,582
Hello, Lieutenant.

358
00:19:26,618 --> 00:19:28,950
- It's good to see you.
- You, too, Lieutenant.

359
00:19:28,987 --> 00:19:31,182
Pick a hand.

360
00:19:35,093 --> 00:19:36,890
It's beautiful.

361
00:19:38,764 --> 00:19:40,732
What's in your other hand?

362
00:19:40,766 --> 00:19:42,256
Mine.

363
00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:47,261
Well, it took me six hours
to fold these.

364
00:19:52,577 --> 00:19:54,636
I want you to meet my friends.

365
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,911
Rafe, this is Martha,
Barbara, Sandra...

366
00:19:57,949 --> 00:20:00,747
- Hi. I'm Betty.
- Hi.

367
00:20:00,786 --> 00:20:03,050
Would you happen
to have any friends?

368
00:20:03,088 --> 00:20:06,489
Take your pick.

369
00:20:06,525 --> 00:20:08,152
Hi.

370
00:20:32,651 --> 00:20:34,949
We ever get in this war
and somethin' happens to me...

371
00:20:34,986 --> 00:20:38,945
I can't tell you how good
it makes me feel to know...

372
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,458
that someone as sweet
as you will be there...

373
00:20:41,493 --> 00:20:43,222
to nurse me back to health.

374
00:20:43,261 --> 00:20:45,627
Good, but we're not
in the war yet.

375
00:20:45,664 --> 00:20:48,224
OK. That was a bad line.

376
00:20:48,266 --> 00:20:50,632
Hi.

377
00:20:50,669 --> 00:20:53,263
I'm Red.

378
00:20:53,305 --> 00:20:58,902
Red S-s-strange.

379
00:20:58,944 --> 00:21:00,809
Your last name's Strange?

380
00:21:00,846 --> 00:21:02,245
Yeah. She's all yours, soldier.

381
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,714
No. It's Winkle.

382
00:21:06,485 --> 00:21:08,214
Red is such a ladies' man.

383
00:21:08,253 --> 00:21:09,413
Do you always stutter?

384
00:21:09,454 --> 00:21:13,220
No. Only when I'm...

385
00:21:13,258 --> 00:21:14,486
She's totally buying it.

386
00:21:14,526 --> 00:21:16,426
- Nervous?
- Yeah.

387
00:21:16,461 --> 00:21:18,156
Why can't I get
something like that?

388
00:21:26,471 --> 00:21:27,699
Hello.

389
00:21:27,739 --> 00:21:29,297
Hi.

390
00:21:29,341 --> 00:21:31,935
Danny seems kind of shy
around the girls.

391
00:21:31,977 --> 00:21:35,435
It's not that he's shy.

392
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,777
He's just...

393
00:21:36,815 --> 00:21:39,283
a little unsure of himself,
you know.

394
00:21:39,317 --> 00:21:41,251
His old man used to
run him down a lot.

395
00:21:41,286 --> 00:21:44,983
Get him in a plane,
he's sure of himself.

396
00:21:45,023 --> 00:21:47,287
He's like my brother.
He's like my best friend.

397
00:21:47,325 --> 00:21:49,987
He's my right hand.

398
00:21:50,028 --> 00:21:54,465
Which at the moment is
a long way south of my waist.

399
00:21:54,499 --> 00:21:56,126
Oh, I'm sorry.

400
00:21:56,168 --> 00:21:58,830
I guess I lost
a little altitude.

401
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,861
Yeah, I guess you did.

402
00:22:00,906 --> 00:22:02,430
Excuse me.

403
00:22:16,955 --> 00:22:19,389
You and me, we got to talk.

404
00:22:19,424 --> 00:22:23,087
So, the rumor is the Navy's
shipping us to Pearl Harbor.

405
00:22:23,128 --> 00:22:25,096
Well, won't be so bad.

406
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:27,758
It's about as far from
the fighting as you can get.

407
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:29,664
You'll get a suntan.

408
00:22:29,701 --> 00:22:33,398
So maybe the Army'll
post you guys there, too.

409
00:22:33,438 --> 00:22:37,499
You... are a super special woman.

410
00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:38,975
And, well...

411
00:22:40,512 --> 00:22:42,446
Well, they're training me...

412
00:22:42,481 --> 00:22:47,646
to be a big bad warrior,
and, well...

413
00:22:50,088 --> 00:22:52,181
So, you never know
what might happen tomorrow...

414
00:22:52,224 --> 00:22:57,787
or any day
after that, you know?

415
00:22:57,829 --> 00:23:00,389
So...

416
00:23:00,432 --> 00:23:03,492
God, we need to make
tonight super special.

417
00:23:03,535 --> 00:23:06,197
Why are you crying?

418
00:23:06,238 --> 00:23:07,899
I guess it's the thought...

419
00:23:07,939 --> 00:23:10,407
that I might not ever
get to see you again.

420
00:23:10,442 --> 00:23:12,205
Dry your eyes, toots.

421
00:23:12,244 --> 00:23:13,438
Tonight, you're mine.

422
00:23:13,478 --> 00:23:15,639
I don't want to be
with a crowd tonight.

423
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,240
I just want to be
alone with you.

424
00:23:20,285 --> 00:23:23,186
How does New York Harbor
by moonlight sound?

425
00:23:25,457 --> 00:23:27,925
Are you gonna be
a bad influence?

426
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:30,450
Of course I'm a bad influence.

427
00:23:30,495 --> 00:23:32,429
Let's see if we can
commandeer this vessel...

428
00:23:32,464 --> 00:23:34,762
'cause we're officers
of the U.S. Government.

429
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,528
Not for long, we won't be.

430
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:49,945
One day, we'll take a trip
on a boat like that.

431
00:23:49,981 --> 00:23:51,380
Would you like that?

432
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:55,614
We'll be dressing for cocktails
and walk into the grand salon.

433
00:23:55,654 --> 00:23:57,281
No one's talking about war.

434
00:23:57,322 --> 00:23:59,620
They're just dancing
to Cole Porter.

435
00:23:59,658 --> 00:24:02,320
I'll have to get a tux.

436
00:24:06,598 --> 00:24:09,396
Come on. There you go.
All aboard.

437
00:24:09,434 --> 00:24:11,561
You're out of your mind.

438
00:24:11,603 --> 00:24:12,934
Careful now.
Here, sit down.

439
00:24:14,272 --> 00:24:16,172
Now let's see here.

440
00:24:18,443 --> 00:24:21,844
There we go.

441
00:24:23,448 --> 00:24:26,576
See, this is as close as I
could get you to your ship.

442
00:24:26,618 --> 00:24:28,779
So, at least I tried, right?

443
00:24:30,322 --> 00:24:32,722
Actually, you know what?
This is better.

444
00:24:32,757 --> 00:24:34,622
Yeah, it is.

445
00:24:34,659 --> 00:24:37,127
God, you're pretty.

446
00:24:55,814 --> 00:24:59,147
What's gonna become
of us all, Rafe?

447
00:25:00,819 --> 00:25:05,654
Well, the future's not
exactly in our hands, is it?

448
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:08,386
No. I guess you're right.

449
00:25:20,105 --> 00:25:22,733
Oh, my God!
Are you all right?

450
00:25:22,774 --> 00:25:24,036
Yeah, are you?

451
00:25:24,075 --> 00:25:25,702
That was not part of the date.

452
00:25:32,917 --> 00:25:34,077
Watch your step.

453
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:36,747
Oh, thank you.

454
00:25:38,123 --> 00:25:40,819
Guys, come on up!

455
00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:43,726
Come up! We're in 321.

456
00:25:43,762 --> 00:25:45,730
There's something
I got to tell you.

457
00:25:45,764 --> 00:25:47,959
You got no secrets
from me, Lieutenant.

458
00:25:47,999 --> 00:25:49,660
I've seen your medical chart.

459
00:25:57,075 --> 00:26:00,408
This can't be good, or it
wouldn't be so hard to say.

460
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,548
I got to go away.

461
00:26:04,582 --> 00:26:07,050
We're all going away.

462
00:26:07,085 --> 00:26:08,882
Yeah...

463
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,583
but I'm going to the war...
tomorrow.

464
00:26:13,758 --> 00:26:15,589
I'm flying with
the Eagle Squadron.

465
00:26:15,627 --> 00:26:19,893
It's an outfit the British
started for American pilots.

466
00:26:19,931 --> 00:26:24,061
I don't understand.

467
00:26:24,102 --> 00:26:27,071
You're in the U.S. Army.
How could they order you to go?

468
00:26:27,105 --> 00:26:29,573
They didn't order me.

469
00:26:29,607 --> 00:26:31,734
I volunteered.

470
00:26:36,681 --> 00:26:38,911
But I passed you.

471
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:41,680
I let you through.

472
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,415
And now you volunteer...

473
00:26:43,455 --> 00:26:45,582
for the most dangerous place
you could go?

474
00:26:45,623 --> 00:26:49,582
It's not your responsibility,
not your choice.

475
00:26:49,627 --> 00:26:52,528
Flying's the only thing
I ever wanted to do.

476
00:26:52,564 --> 00:26:56,898
Everything in my life
has led me up to this point.

477
00:26:59,637 --> 00:27:01,298
Meeting you.

478
00:27:04,943 --> 00:27:06,171
I love you.

479
00:27:08,446 --> 00:27:10,607
I love you so much.

480
00:27:13,485 --> 00:27:15,453
Let's go inside.

481
00:27:23,061 --> 00:27:25,393
All right. Wait a minute.

482
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,091
Just... I can't do this.

483
00:27:27,132 --> 00:27:30,898
It's not right.
I'm sorry.

484
00:27:30,935 --> 00:27:32,425
See, I can't do this.

485
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:35,564
I mean, I can.
I want to.

486
00:27:35,607 --> 00:27:38,474
I'm not trying to be noble,
you know.

487
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,740
Or not saying
I know what would happen...

488
00:27:40,779 --> 00:27:42,872
I need to stop talking.

489
00:27:42,914 --> 00:27:46,543
I just don't want it
to be like everybody else.

490
00:27:46,584 --> 00:27:48,575
I don't want you to have
anything about tonight...

491
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,451
that you regret.

492
00:27:50,488 --> 00:27:53,855
It's been the most
incredible night of my life...

493
00:27:53,892 --> 00:27:56,258
and I don't want to ruin that.

494
00:27:56,294 --> 00:27:58,285
You couldn't ruin it.

495
00:27:59,798 --> 00:28:05,668
If I had one more night to live,
I'd want to spend it with you.

496
00:28:07,105 --> 00:28:09,437
See, that's what I want
to come home to.

497
00:28:09,474 --> 00:28:12,875
That's what I want to have
to think about and dream about.

498
00:28:12,911 --> 00:28:15,539
I want to know that
the best part of my life...

499
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,480
is still ahead of me.

500
00:28:18,583 --> 00:28:20,210
Look.

501
00:28:20,251 --> 00:28:26,053
Don't...
Could you not come see me off?

502
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:29,651
Because saying good-bye
to you once is hard enough.

503
00:28:32,764 --> 00:28:35,096
Here.

504
00:28:37,602 --> 00:28:38,899
Take this.

505
00:28:38,937 --> 00:28:41,565
Why?
You think it looks good on me?

506
00:28:45,944 --> 00:28:48,105
I will come back.

507
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:26,881
I thought you said
you told her not to come.

508
00:29:26,918 --> 00:29:28,215
Yeah, I did.

509
00:29:28,253 --> 00:29:29,948
Why you looking for her then?

510
00:29:29,988 --> 00:29:32,718
It's my test.

511
00:29:32,757 --> 00:29:34,884
If I tell her not to come,
and she comes anyway...

512
00:29:34,926 --> 00:29:37,292
then I know she loves me.

513
00:29:37,328 --> 00:29:39,558
All aboard! Track 57!

514
00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:47,238
If anything happens to me...

515
00:29:47,272 --> 00:29:49,672
I want you to be the one
to tell her.

516
00:29:49,707 --> 00:29:51,231
All right?

517
00:29:51,276 --> 00:29:55,007
You just make sure and come back
for the both of us, all right?

518
00:30:08,459 --> 00:30:10,222
See you when I get back.

519
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,131
Good hunting, Rafe.

520
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,076
She loves me.

521
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,740
The German Luftwaffe...

522
00:31:07,785 --> 00:31:10,913
relentlessly bombards
downtown London...

523
00:31:10,955 --> 00:31:12,923
while Churchill's
Royal Air Force...

524
00:31:12,957 --> 00:31:14,424
is in a deadly struggle...

525
00:31:14,459 --> 00:31:17,622
to maintain control
of the British skies.

526
00:31:39,384 --> 00:31:41,011
This is a real mess.

527
00:31:41,052 --> 00:31:44,715
Lieutenant McCawley
reporting for duty, sir.

528
00:31:47,025 --> 00:31:48,185
Good.

529
00:31:48,226 --> 00:31:51,024
We'll get you settled
into your quarters.

530
00:31:51,062 --> 00:31:54,361
And then introduce you
to the crate you'll be flying.

531
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,926
If y'all are patching up
bullet holes here...

532
00:31:57,969 --> 00:31:59,197
maybe we ought
to skip housekeeping...

533
00:31:59,237 --> 00:32:00,602
and get me in an airplane.

534
00:32:00,638 --> 00:32:01,935
Two didn't come back, sir.

535
00:32:01,973 --> 00:32:03,804
We counted only eleven.

536
00:32:10,515 --> 00:32:12,540
Are all Yanks
as anxious as you...

537
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:14,642
to get themselves killed,
Pilot Officer?

538
00:32:14,685 --> 00:32:17,916
Not anxious to die, sir.
Just anxious to matter.

539
00:32:23,795 --> 00:32:25,524
This is yours.

540
00:32:27,231 --> 00:32:28,755
Good chap.

541
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,928
Didn't die till he'd landed
and shut down his engine.

542
00:32:46,217 --> 00:32:47,844
Please be seated, gentlemen.

543
00:32:51,089 --> 00:32:53,489
I'm afraid I'm in a bad mood.

544
00:32:53,524 --> 00:32:58,826
Churchill and Stalin are
asking me what I'm asking you.

545
00:32:58,863 --> 00:33:01,923
How long is America
going to pretend...

546
00:33:01,966 --> 00:33:03,729
the world is not at war?

547
00:33:03,768 --> 00:33:06,601
We've increased food and oil
shipments, Mr. President...

548
00:33:06,637 --> 00:33:07,968
and as far as I know...

549
00:33:08,005 --> 00:33:10,633
What they really need
are tanks, planes...

550
00:33:10,675 --> 00:33:12,438
bullets, bombs,
and men to fight.

551
00:33:12,477 --> 00:33:16,709
But our people think
Hitler and his Nazi thugs...

552
00:33:16,747 --> 00:33:18,806
are Europe's problem.

553
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:22,377
We have to do more.

554
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,911
Send the Brits and Russians
more of our ships...

555
00:33:24,956 --> 00:33:26,480
and anti-aircraft weapons.

556
00:33:26,524 --> 00:33:28,458
And keep cannibalizing
the Pacific Fleet?

557
00:33:28,493 --> 00:33:30,085
What choice do we have?

558
00:33:30,128 --> 00:33:34,895
We're building refrigerators
while our enemies build bombs.

559
00:34:43,668 --> 00:34:45,295
This is so exciting.

560
00:34:45,336 --> 00:34:47,804
You know there's about
one hundred ships on Pearl.

561
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:49,305
How many sailors per ship?

562
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,740
It depends.
More on a battleship than a sub.

563
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:54,267
But say, on average... 2,000?

564
00:34:54,312 --> 00:34:57,577
Then there's the flyers,
the Marines, base personnel.

565
00:34:57,615 --> 00:34:58,946
I'm still working on
the sailors.

566
00:34:58,983 --> 00:35:01,474
Girls, I think the odds
are in your favor.

567
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:03,384
Yeah, like 4,000 to one.

568
00:35:03,421 --> 00:35:05,981
It's paradise.

569
00:35:06,023 --> 00:35:07,888
See you on the beach, boys!

570
00:35:07,925 --> 00:35:10,416
We're in Hawaii!

571
00:35:18,436 --> 00:35:20,904
You're not supposed
to paint titties...

572
00:35:20,938 --> 00:35:22,337
on the side of my airplanes.

573
00:35:22,373 --> 00:35:25,035
And if you do,
don't make 'em lopsided.

574
00:35:25,076 --> 00:35:26,236
They were lopsided, Earl.

575
00:35:26,277 --> 00:35:27,505
Look, it says right here.

576
00:35:27,545 --> 00:35:31,845
"Never ride waves amongst
rocks or submerged pilings."

577
00:35:31,882 --> 00:35:33,645
See, it says
you shouldn't do that.

578
00:35:33,684 --> 00:35:36,676
How do you know they're
submerged if they're submerged?

579
00:35:36,721 --> 00:35:39,315
Gooz, what in the hell
are you doing?

580
00:35:39,357 --> 00:35:41,291
Just trying to fix
this surfboard thing.

581
00:35:41,325 --> 00:35:43,520
He keeps taking chunks off
his nose on the rocks.

582
00:35:43,561 --> 00:35:45,995
On my day off, I'm working
on my new invention...

583
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:48,760
the Gooz Cruise Fin.

584
00:35:48,799 --> 00:35:50,289
I'm gonna be a rich fella.

585
00:35:50,334 --> 00:35:52,529
Every surfboard
in the nation's gonna need one.

586
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:54,265
Yeah? Well,
you're gonna need a broom.

587
00:35:54,305 --> 00:35:56,796
Check out these new recruits.

588
00:35:59,143 --> 00:36:00,337
Hi.

589
00:36:00,378 --> 00:36:02,278
Aloha.

590
00:36:02,313 --> 00:36:04,747
You all pilots?

591
00:36:04,782 --> 00:36:06,875
We're working on it.

592
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:08,908
It's a lot of switches
and stuff.

593
00:36:10,154 --> 00:36:13,851
Pride of the Pacific.

594
00:36:13,891 --> 00:36:16,382
Who are you?

595
00:36:16,427 --> 00:36:18,019
Terrors of the skies.

596
00:36:20,631 --> 00:36:21,791
Welcome, ladies.

597
00:36:21,832 --> 00:36:23,493
Hi.

598
00:36:23,534 --> 00:36:26,264
I have to deal with
toasty sunburnt rump...

599
00:36:26,304 --> 00:36:28,465
before I can show you around.

600
00:36:33,344 --> 00:36:35,369
Dear Evelyn.

601
00:36:35,413 --> 00:36:38,109
It's different than I thought
it would be here.

602
00:36:38,149 --> 00:36:39,810
It's cold...

603
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:44,787
so cold it goes deep
into your bones.

604
00:36:44,822 --> 00:36:47,814
There is one place
I can go to find warmth.

605
00:36:47,858 --> 00:36:50,190
That is to think of you.

606
00:36:50,227 --> 00:36:52,718
I just wish I could be
back there with you.

607
00:36:55,966 --> 00:36:58,434
It's not easy making friends.

608
00:36:58,469 --> 00:36:59,800
Two days ago, I had a beer...

609
00:36:59,837 --> 00:37:01,828
with a couple
of the RAF pilots.

610
00:37:01,872 --> 00:37:04,067
Yesterday,
both of them got killed.

611
00:37:16,954 --> 00:37:18,979
Dear Rafe.

612
00:37:19,023 --> 00:37:21,617
I miss you so much.

613
00:37:21,659 --> 00:37:25,527
It's so strange to be
half a world away from you.

614
00:37:26,864 --> 00:37:28,354
I'm right on his tail!

615
00:37:34,405 --> 00:37:37,135
Got one!

616
00:37:37,174 --> 00:37:40,200
Every night
I look at the sunset...

617
00:37:40,244 --> 00:37:43,645
and try to draw the last ounce
of heat from its long day...

618
00:37:43,681 --> 00:37:47,276
and send it
from my heart to yours.

619
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,350
Family?

620
00:37:54,392 --> 00:37:57,589
Girl, sir.

621
00:37:57,628 --> 00:38:00,119
The girl.

622
00:38:01,766 --> 00:38:04,064
A lot of people
frown on the Yanks...

623
00:38:04,101 --> 00:38:05,762
for not being in this war yet.

624
00:38:05,803 --> 00:38:07,668
I'd just like to say...

625
00:38:07,705 --> 00:38:10,674
if there are many more
back home like you...

626
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:14,109
God help anyone who goes
to war with America.

627
00:38:19,683 --> 00:38:21,617
Atten-hut!

628
00:38:21,652 --> 00:38:24,177
Attention on deck!
Admiral Kimmel...

629
00:38:24,221 --> 00:38:26,553
Commander-in-Chief,
Pacific Fleet, on deck.

630
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:27,818
Sharp presentation, Captain.

631
00:38:27,858 --> 00:38:29,621
Thank you, Admiral Kimmel.

632
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:32,493
For four months now Washington's
been blowing pink smoke...

633
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,157
about the threat from Japan.

634
00:38:34,198 --> 00:38:35,756
Could make us lose
our fighting edge.

635
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,495
I'm determined
not to let that happen.

636
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:45,469
With your permission, Captain.

637
00:38:45,509 --> 00:38:48,535
Admiral, urgent,
from Washington.

638
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:54,413
I'm supposed
to keep this fleet...

639
00:38:54,452 --> 00:38:56,249
battle-ready
to take on the Japanese...

640
00:38:56,287 --> 00:38:58,551
cover half the damn globe.

641
00:38:58,589 --> 00:39:00,113
Now they want me to transfer...

642
00:39:00,157 --> 00:39:01,624
another twelve destroyers
to the Atlantic.

643
00:39:01,659 --> 00:39:03,217
Don't they know what
we're facing out here?

644
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,194
They feel Europe
is the greater danger.

645
00:39:05,229 --> 00:39:08,255
I'm assuming these risk
assessments include Hawaii?

646
00:39:08,299 --> 00:39:11,462
Pearl Harbor is too shallow
for an aerial torpedo attack.

647
00:39:11,502 --> 00:39:12,901
We're surrounded by sub nets.

648
00:39:12,937 --> 00:39:15,132
All we need to worry
about is sabotage...

649
00:39:15,172 --> 00:39:16,799
so we bunched
our planes together...

650
00:39:16,841 --> 00:39:18,536
to make them easier to protect.

651
00:39:18,576 --> 00:39:20,703
Distance is our ally, Admiral.

652
00:39:20,744 --> 00:39:24,805
You analysts got it
all figured out, don't you?

653
00:39:24,849 --> 00:39:27,181
The smart enemy hits you...

654
00:39:27,218 --> 00:39:28,981
exactly where
you think you're safe.

655
00:40:39,356 --> 00:40:41,756
Incoming!

656
00:40:52,269 --> 00:40:54,635
I fixed the hydraulics
and electrics, sir...

657
00:40:54,672 --> 00:40:56,640
but the oil hoses
still need attention.

658
00:40:56,674 --> 00:40:57,834
Just crank it, lan!

659
00:40:57,875 --> 00:40:59,240
God speed you, sir.

660
00:41:08,552 --> 00:41:09,883
Red section, take the bombers.

661
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,411
Blue section,
look out for the fighters.

662
00:41:12,456 --> 00:41:14,219
Bombers dead ahead.

663
00:41:14,258 --> 00:41:16,488
Let's drop in
and give 'em a reception.

664
00:41:19,463 --> 00:41:21,863
Red Two, follow my lead,
high side.

665
00:41:21,899 --> 00:41:23,264
Go right at the lead bomber.

666
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,494
Following you, Red One.

667
00:41:32,543 --> 00:41:33,737
Good hit!

668
00:41:38,682 --> 00:41:40,741
Red One, coming around,
reset for the kill.

669
00:41:43,287 --> 00:41:44,481
I have the middle bomber.

670
00:41:48,759 --> 00:41:49,953
Hammer down!

671
00:41:54,898 --> 00:41:57,560
We got him.
Nice shot, Red Two.

672
00:41:57,601 --> 00:42:00,092
I got two M.E. S dead ahead.

673
00:42:05,042 --> 00:42:07,374
I'm on him.
I'm on his tail.

674
00:42:07,411 --> 00:42:08,969
Hammer down.

675
00:42:11,181 --> 00:42:13,012
I got one of them!

676
00:42:24,628 --> 00:42:25,890
I got another one.

677
00:42:25,929 --> 00:42:28,454
Red One, you got fighters
all over your tail!

678
00:42:29,633 --> 00:42:31,225
I'm under fire!
I'm taking fire!

679
00:42:34,338 --> 00:42:37,432
Red One, get out of there.
Pull up!

680
00:42:42,646 --> 00:42:45,137
I got an oil leak.

681
00:42:49,053 --> 00:42:50,884
Can't see a damn thing!

682
00:42:53,223 --> 00:42:55,817
I can't bail!
My canopy's stuck!

683
00:42:55,859 --> 00:42:57,486
I can't bail out!

684
00:43:07,137 --> 00:43:08,695
He's on my tail, Red Two.

685
00:43:12,543 --> 00:43:14,534
I'm hit!

686
00:43:22,553 --> 00:43:24,544
Mayday!

687
00:43:29,226 --> 00:43:31,387
Oh, my God.

688
00:43:45,242 --> 00:43:46,607
I'm no good at church.

689
00:43:46,643 --> 00:43:47,803
What do you mean, sweetie?

690
00:43:47,845 --> 00:43:51,337
When I'm up there getting
my slate wiped clean...

691
00:43:51,381 --> 00:43:54,282
I'm thinking how
to dirty it up again.

692
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:55,478
This from a virgin!

693
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,419
I got to inventory supplies.

694
00:43:57,454 --> 00:43:59,354
Kill me now.

695
00:43:59,389 --> 00:44:01,289
Could you be any more boring?

696
00:44:01,325 --> 00:44:03,589
Don't bother.
Sunday, she writes Rafe...

697
00:44:03,627 --> 00:44:06,095
ten pages instead
of the usual five.

698
00:44:07,364 --> 00:44:09,195
Gosh, I wish I was in love.

699
00:44:11,635 --> 00:44:13,432
Hey, sweetheart.

700
00:44:14,738 --> 00:44:15,966
She hates me.

701
00:44:17,207 --> 00:44:18,435
Good to see you, Red.

702
00:44:18,475 --> 00:44:21,000
Good to see you, too, Betty.

703
00:44:21,044 --> 00:44:22,534
You wanna come for a ride?

704
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:24,046
Come on.

705
00:44:24,081 --> 00:44:26,379
Yeah, I'll be your chauffeur.

706
00:44:38,162 --> 00:44:39,561
That-a-boy! Be a mad dog!

707
00:44:39,596 --> 00:44:43,032
You hit pretty hard...
for a cook.

708
00:44:45,169 --> 00:44:47,399
All right, Walker,
who you got?

709
00:44:47,437 --> 00:44:49,166
I'll take the cook.

710
00:44:49,206 --> 00:44:50,468
Why? You don't like money?

711
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:55,173
Come on! Get out there now!

712
00:44:58,549 --> 00:45:01,040
- I'll put five on it.
- Done.

713
00:45:02,452 --> 00:45:03,851
Against a mechanic?

714
00:45:03,887 --> 00:45:05,787
That guy craps rivets.

715
00:45:05,823 --> 00:45:07,120
How's it feel up
from the engine room?

716
00:45:07,157 --> 00:45:08,488
Sunlight botherin' you?

717
00:45:12,396 --> 00:45:13,988
Man, he's getting all busted up!

718
00:45:15,265 --> 00:45:16,664
Move!

719
00:45:18,202 --> 00:45:19,760
Come here, we gotta talk.

720
00:45:19,803 --> 00:45:21,202
Get down here.

721
00:45:21,238 --> 00:45:22,500
He can't hurt us.

722
00:45:22,539 --> 00:45:24,632
He can hurt us.

723
00:45:24,675 --> 00:45:27,041
- He cut us. We bleeding.
- Bleeding?

724
00:45:27,077 --> 00:45:29,910
That's a scratch. See this?

725
00:45:29,947 --> 00:45:31,380
This is the hard-earned
greenbacks...

726
00:45:31,415 --> 00:45:33,940
of every pot-scrubbin'
chop in this fleet.

727
00:45:33,984 --> 00:45:35,474
Now if we don't win...

728
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:37,817
Teeny here has to find
another battleship!

729
00:45:37,855 --> 00:45:40,187
I'm not going back
to the Arizona empty-handed.

730
00:45:40,224 --> 00:45:42,852
Don't worry about the money.

731
00:45:42,893 --> 00:45:46,226
I'll send that
smug engine-fixin' snipe...

732
00:45:46,263 --> 00:45:47,821
back belowdecks where he belong.

733
00:45:49,066 --> 00:45:50,761
We the man!

734
00:45:50,801 --> 00:45:53,133
He slapped your mama!
Be a son of a bitch!

735
00:46:02,012 --> 00:46:03,377
Look at this!
All right, Dorie!

736
00:46:16,493 --> 00:46:18,893
That's enough.

737
00:46:22,633 --> 00:46:26,262
- Where's my money?
- Fight's rigged.

738
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:28,794
We're rich!

739
00:46:31,441 --> 00:46:32,635
How'd you get this?

740
00:46:32,676 --> 00:46:34,803
Boxing.

741
00:46:34,845 --> 00:46:36,403
Did you win?

742
00:46:36,446 --> 00:46:38,346
Yes, ma'am.

743
00:46:38,382 --> 00:46:42,250
What do you get for winning?

744
00:46:42,286 --> 00:46:43,913
Respect.

745
00:46:48,625 --> 00:46:53,187
So, why do you have to fight
with your fists to get respect?

746
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:55,460
I left my mama in Texas...

747
00:46:55,499 --> 00:46:57,626
and joined the Navy
to see the world...

748
00:46:57,668 --> 00:46:59,795
become a man.

749
00:46:59,836 --> 00:47:02,634
They made me a cook.

750
00:47:02,673 --> 00:47:03,935
Not even that.

751
00:47:03,974 --> 00:47:07,102
I clean up after
other sailors eat.

752
00:47:07,144 --> 00:47:12,480
Two years, they never even
let me fire a weapon.

753
00:47:12,516 --> 00:47:15,280
Let's hope you never have to.

754
00:47:16,486 --> 00:47:17,783
Yes, ma'am.

755
00:47:17,821 --> 00:47:19,686
You take care,
Petty Officer Miller.

756
00:47:19,723 --> 00:47:21,384
You, too, ma'am.

757
00:48:04,534 --> 00:48:07,799
You know, he taught me to fly.

758
00:48:07,838 --> 00:48:10,671
I always knew that no matter
what trouble I got into...

759
00:48:10,707 --> 00:48:13,267
I'd never be in it alone.

760
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:17,770
He'd be there with me.

761
00:48:17,814 --> 00:48:21,409
He was always pushing me
to be better and faster.

762
00:48:23,553 --> 00:48:26,420
He told me
you were a great flier.

763
00:48:27,491 --> 00:48:29,322
It was the same night
he told me...

764
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:31,418
he'd volunteered
to go to England.

765
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:36,365
Volunteered?

766
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,892
He told me he'd been assigned.

767
00:48:44,941 --> 00:48:48,172
He was always
trying to protect me.

768
00:48:51,648 --> 00:48:53,206
But you know what?

769
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:56,014
I look at myself in
the mirror in this uniform...

770
00:48:56,053 --> 00:48:59,454
and I still don't know who I am.

771
00:48:59,489 --> 00:49:02,822
I look like a hero...

772
00:49:02,859 --> 00:49:05,521
but I don't feel like it.

773
00:49:07,364 --> 00:49:10,629
Rafe...

774
00:49:10,667 --> 00:49:14,398
he always looked the part,
didn't he?

775
00:49:14,438 --> 00:49:16,668
He couldn't wait to be one.

776
00:49:39,629 --> 00:49:42,655
To Rafe McCawley.

777
00:49:42,699 --> 00:49:46,260
The best pilot...

778
00:49:46,303 --> 00:49:50,069
and the best friend
I ever knew...

779
00:49:50,107 --> 00:49:51,699
or ever will know.

780
00:49:55,946 --> 00:49:57,607
To Rafe.

781
00:51:04,014 --> 00:51:05,481
Look at this.
The Japanese...

782
00:51:05,515 --> 00:51:07,608
are flooding the Pacific
with radio traffic.

783
00:51:07,651 --> 00:51:11,087
Everywhere from the Panama Canal
to southeast Asia.

784
00:51:11,121 --> 00:51:12,645
There's no logical pattern,
Captain.

785
00:51:12,689 --> 00:51:14,156
No. There's always logic.

786
00:51:14,191 --> 00:51:16,489
They know we read their mail.

787
00:51:16,526 --> 00:51:20,758
They're trying to make us think
their fleet is moving south.

788
00:51:20,797 --> 00:51:22,628
I'm not buying it.

789
00:51:22,666 --> 00:51:25,760
Something's up.

790
00:51:25,802 --> 00:51:29,636
Otherwise, why would they take
the trouble to bullshit me?

791
00:51:44,087 --> 00:51:48,581
Evelyn, I signed for
these letters for you today.

792
00:51:48,625 --> 00:51:51,093
They're from England.

793
00:51:51,127 --> 00:51:52,788
They're from Rafe.

794
00:51:52,829 --> 00:51:54,820
I'm sorry, Ev.

795
00:51:54,864 --> 00:51:57,662
You know how long
it takes mail to get here.

796
00:52:11,248 --> 00:52:12,408
Hurry up!

797
00:52:12,449 --> 00:52:14,041
Show time, boys! Come on!

798
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:19,786
America still awaits
Japan's response...

799
00:52:19,823 --> 00:52:21,256
to peace proposals.

800
00:52:21,291 --> 00:52:23,782
Ambassador Nomura
arrives in Washington...

801
00:52:23,827 --> 00:52:25,454
in what could
hopefully guarantee...

802
00:52:25,495 --> 00:52:27,827
continued peace in the Pacific.

803
00:52:27,864 --> 00:52:30,298
On the British front,
Churchill declares...

804
00:52:30,333 --> 00:52:33,461
"Give us the tools,
and we will finish the job."

805
00:52:35,705 --> 00:52:38,139
The RAF has fought
bravely against...

806
00:52:38,174 --> 00:52:43,077
Hitler's ambition to rule
the skies over the Channel.

807
00:52:43,113 --> 00:52:46,640
Victory does not come
without sacrifice.

808
00:52:51,621 --> 00:52:53,555
Some comedy, huh?

809
00:52:56,693 --> 00:52:58,718
It's been a while.

810
00:52:58,762 --> 00:53:01,322
I've been logging
a lot of flight hours.

811
00:53:01,364 --> 00:53:03,696
I kinda been avoiding you, too.

812
00:53:08,371 --> 00:53:09,599
Do you want to?

813
00:53:09,639 --> 00:53:11,766
Sure, yeah.

814
00:53:11,808 --> 00:53:15,403
I remember one time
when I was seven years old...

815
00:53:15,445 --> 00:53:17,879
I was always building
gadgets and things.

816
00:53:17,914 --> 00:53:20,007
He wanted me
to build him some wings...

817
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:21,915
so he could fly like his daddy.

818
00:53:21,951 --> 00:53:25,114
I told him you can't fly
without some kind of engine.

819
00:53:25,155 --> 00:53:26,782
But he wouldn't listen.

820
00:53:26,823 --> 00:53:29,314
"Danny, never mind that,
just build 'em anyway."

821
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:31,589
So I did.

822
00:53:31,628 --> 00:53:33,289
And I'm up there...

823
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:35,355
strapping these big ol' wings
on his back...

824
00:53:35,398 --> 00:53:37,298
that we made
from paper and glue...

825
00:53:37,334 --> 00:53:39,734
and these massive silk bloomers
that we stole.

826
00:53:39,769 --> 00:53:42,237
He looked so stupid,
and I told him...

827
00:53:42,272 --> 00:53:45,105
"You can't jump off the barn
in these."

828
00:53:46,443 --> 00:53:49,105
He busted his leg on a backhoe.

829
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:55,683
God, I miss him.

830
00:53:55,719 --> 00:53:58,882
Yeah. But don't you think...

831
00:53:58,922 --> 00:54:01,049
that Rafe wasn't
back up there next day.

832
00:54:01,091 --> 00:54:02,456
Cast and everything...

833
00:54:02,492 --> 00:54:06,258
telling me to make some
adjustments on those wings.

834
00:54:06,296 --> 00:54:07,820
Check this out!

835
00:54:07,864 --> 00:54:09,695
Crossroads of the Pacific.

836
00:54:09,733 --> 00:54:12,725
Tahiti... 1,700 miles!

837
00:54:12,769 --> 00:54:14,999
All right!

838
00:54:15,038 --> 00:54:17,302
Say, Betty...

839
00:54:26,182 --> 00:54:28,275
- No, Betty! Get up!
- What's going on, Red?

840
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:31,253
- Stand up, please.
- What do you mean?

841
00:54:31,287 --> 00:54:33,152
Just stand up.

842
00:54:37,727 --> 00:54:39,354
Betty...

843
00:54:39,396 --> 00:54:40,556
Red, come on!

844
00:54:40,597 --> 00:54:43,259
We got a dinner reservation.

845
00:54:45,034 --> 00:54:46,695
Can I get a minute?

846
00:54:48,671 --> 00:54:50,161
What's the matter, you sick?

847
00:54:51,841 --> 00:54:53,502
Can a guy propose?!

848
00:54:55,311 --> 00:54:57,176
Thank you!

849
00:54:57,213 --> 00:54:59,078
Am I talking too much?

850
00:54:59,115 --> 00:55:01,743
Sometimes I do that, I'm sorry.

851
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:05,014
Hold up!

852
00:55:05,054 --> 00:55:06,715
Look at this.

853
00:55:06,756 --> 00:55:08,348
Hello!

854
00:55:08,391 --> 00:55:10,916
Let's get out of here.

855
00:55:14,831 --> 00:55:17,322
I guess I should go.

856
00:55:17,367 --> 00:55:20,097
Don't let it be three months
before I see you again.

857
00:55:20,136 --> 00:55:21,501
I had a good time.

858
00:55:21,538 --> 00:55:22,835
Yeah, me, too.

859
00:55:24,374 --> 00:55:26,239
Do you want me
to walk you home?

860
00:55:26,276 --> 00:55:27,903
No, I'll be fine.

861
00:55:27,944 --> 00:55:29,878
No... of course.

862
00:55:29,913 --> 00:55:32,108
- Good night.
- Good night.

863
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,293
I was just wondering if maybe
I could come by some time...

864
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:50,094
get a cup of coffee
or a piece of pie?

865
00:55:50,133 --> 00:55:52,897
What am I doing?

866
00:55:59,209 --> 00:56:01,336
You were asleep. I'm sorry.

867
00:56:01,377 --> 00:56:03,140
Danny?

868
00:56:03,179 --> 00:56:04,476
Is something wrong?

869
00:56:04,514 --> 00:56:06,607
Nothing's wrong.
No problem. Hi!

870
00:56:06,649 --> 00:56:08,310
It's just Danny.

871
00:56:11,287 --> 00:56:13,448
You forgot this.

872
00:56:16,359 --> 00:56:17,656
Thanks.

873
00:56:17,694 --> 00:56:19,559
It was good of you
to take the trouble...

874
00:56:19,596 --> 00:56:21,655
to drop it over... now.

875
00:56:21,698 --> 00:56:24,724
I thought you might need it.

876
00:56:24,767 --> 00:56:27,065
Maybe tomorrow morning.

877
00:56:27,103 --> 00:56:28,297
Lf...

878
00:56:28,338 --> 00:56:30,101
not that you wear this
to work, but...

879
00:56:30,139 --> 00:56:32,164
No... it's a hankie.

880
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:37,409
Right. Yeah.

881
00:56:39,182 --> 00:56:44,085
Listen, I was thinking maybe...
I could come by some time...

882
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,782
if I gave you a call,
could I come by?

883
00:56:48,525 --> 00:56:51,619
Once, maybe...
if you're not busy?

884
00:56:52,729 --> 00:56:53,957
Yeah, maybe.

885
00:56:53,997 --> 00:56:56,488
- Maybe?
- Maybe.

886
00:56:56,533 --> 00:56:57,830
OK, all right.

887
00:56:57,867 --> 00:56:59,767
Thanks.

888
00:56:59,802 --> 00:57:00,996
Good-bye. Good night.

889
00:57:01,037 --> 00:57:02,595
You are such an idiot!

890
00:57:07,874 --> 00:57:09,239
Did you have fun last night?

891
00:57:10,277 --> 00:57:11,744
It wasn't how it looked.

892
00:57:11,778 --> 00:57:13,678
And if it was,
it'd be all right.

893
00:57:13,714 --> 00:57:15,739
It's been months.
It's time to move on.

894
00:57:15,782 --> 00:57:17,579
I am moving on.

895
00:57:17,618 --> 00:57:19,176
Ev, don't lie.

896
00:57:19,219 --> 00:57:21,779
All I know is, I hear you crying
when you think I'm asleep.

897
00:57:21,822 --> 00:57:23,847
When my dad left...

898
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:26,085
I was too much
for my mom to handle...

899
00:57:26,126 --> 00:57:28,094
so she sent me
to live with my aunt.

900
00:57:28,128 --> 00:57:30,187
I thought my life was over...

901
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:32,755
but you don't know
where it's all gonna lead.

902
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:35,097
If I hadn't run away
and lied about my age...

903
00:57:35,135 --> 00:57:36,432
and enlisted in the Navy...

904
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:39,132
I wouldn't have met Red, and...

905
00:57:39,172 --> 00:57:41,003
now he's my fiance.

906
00:57:42,976 --> 00:57:45,274
God, I can't
get used to that word.

907
00:57:45,312 --> 00:57:47,473
- It's only been twelve hours.
- Oh, Betty!

908
00:57:47,514 --> 00:57:49,277
Little Betty
beat us all to the post.

909
00:57:49,316 --> 00:57:50,544
And this is ward three.

910
00:57:50,584 --> 00:57:53,109
As you can see, no patients.

911
00:57:53,153 --> 00:57:55,485
Welcome to Hawaii.
Come on, I'll show you the bar.

912
00:57:55,522 --> 00:57:57,649
Sandra, new recruits to torture.

913
00:57:57,691 --> 00:57:59,522
Come on. Excuse me, ladies?

914
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:00,753
Hi!

915
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:04,393
We're gonna wait two years
until I'm nineteen...

916
00:58:04,431 --> 00:58:06,023
and Red can buy me a ring.

917
00:58:08,101 --> 00:58:10,729
Rafe sent his best friend
to tell you...

918
00:58:10,771 --> 00:58:13,797
so you would be OK,
so you can move on.

919
00:58:15,375 --> 00:58:17,138
You gotta go on living, Ev.

920
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:28,554
Sorry!

921
00:58:44,805 --> 00:58:47,330
Bye, Rafe.

922
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:51,707
The Japanese Fleet is missing.

923
00:58:51,745 --> 00:58:54,646
They're operating
under radio silence.

924
00:58:54,681 --> 00:58:59,277
This footage was shot
four days ago on October 28th.

925
00:59:02,322 --> 00:59:05,257
We're sending scout planes
in wider vectors...

926
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:07,760
all over the Pacific,
but they get nothing.

927
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:10,024
They could be anywhere in here.

928
00:59:10,063 --> 00:59:13,226
I don't understand how
two whole carrier divisions...

929
00:59:13,266 --> 00:59:15,757
can just disappear.

930
00:59:21,341 --> 00:59:22,672
Clear!

931
00:59:31,785 --> 00:59:33,878
We're all over the page.

932
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,751
We got one wall-eyed
and one pigeon-toed.

933
00:59:35,789 --> 00:59:38,485
Anthony, tap in number six.
All right.

934
00:59:38,525 --> 00:59:40,493
Gooz, tap in number three.

935
00:59:40,527 --> 00:59:41,824
All right.

936
00:59:41,862 --> 00:59:44,888
Hey. We got a visitor.

937
00:59:44,931 --> 00:59:47,900
That ain't
no Navy issue uniform.

938
00:59:47,934 --> 00:59:49,731
Danny, it's Evelyn.

939
00:59:49,770 --> 00:59:51,294
Jesus!

940
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:53,898
You all right?

941
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:55,908
Yeah.

942
00:59:55,942 --> 00:59:57,569
No.

943
00:59:57,611 --> 01:00:00,136
I think I'm fallin' for her.

944
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:01,977
You know, I saw this coming.

945
01:00:03,383 --> 01:00:04,975
I didn't want this to happen.

946
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:07,043
It just kind of did.
Can't help it.

947
01:00:07,087 --> 01:00:08,679
Danny, she's gotta be
with somebody.

948
01:00:08,722 --> 01:00:10,212
It might as well be you.

949
01:00:10,257 --> 01:00:11,554
You telling me
if you were dead...

950
01:00:11,591 --> 01:00:13,559
and you saw your best buddy
doin' your girl...

951
01:00:13,593 --> 01:00:16,187
you wouldn't come back and beat
the living crap outta him?

952
01:00:16,229 --> 01:00:18,720
- Tony, back off.
- I'd be back so fast.

953
01:00:18,765 --> 01:00:21,495
Danny's being a better friend
taking care of her himself.

954
01:00:21,535 --> 01:00:23,503
I got a girlfriend.

955
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:29,106
That's great.

956
01:00:29,142 --> 01:00:31,508
Come on, fellas.
Let's split.

957
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:34,844
Danny, whatever happens now
is just about you and her.

958
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:36,974
You gotta try
and forget about Rafe.

959
01:00:37,017 --> 01:00:39,144
Be careful, all right?

960
01:00:39,186 --> 01:00:42,280
Ladies... cloud the mind.

961
01:00:42,322 --> 01:00:45,348
- Thanks, Gooz.
- You're welcome.

962
01:00:46,359 --> 01:00:48,156
Hey, Danny.

963
01:00:50,697 --> 01:00:52,187
Where's everybody going?

964
01:00:54,467 --> 01:00:56,401
Just bein' discreet.

965
01:00:56,436 --> 01:00:58,336
Does it seem like everybody's
acting a little strange?

966
01:00:58,371 --> 01:01:00,134
No.

967
01:01:00,173 --> 01:01:01,504
Right.

968
01:01:03,944 --> 01:01:06,310
Well, maybe a little.

969
01:01:06,346 --> 01:01:08,371
People in this outfit...

970
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:10,542
have way too much time
on their hands.

971
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:11,915
Yeah.

972
01:01:11,952 --> 01:01:13,214
I just hope they don't think
there's been something...

973
01:01:13,253 --> 01:01:14,584
goin' on between us,
that's all.

974
01:01:14,621 --> 01:01:18,489
Oh, no. That would be
embarrassing, right?

975
01:01:18,525 --> 01:01:20,083
Forgot my wrenches.

976
01:01:20,126 --> 01:01:21,684
That would definitely
be embarrassing.

977
01:01:21,728 --> 01:01:23,093
Yeah.

978
01:01:23,129 --> 01:01:25,393
Forgot my wrenches.

979
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:28,595
Hey. He really
doesn't have to leave.

980
01:01:28,635 --> 01:01:30,159
No.

981
01:01:30,203 --> 01:01:34,162
I'm just goin' out
with the girls, so...

982
01:01:34,207 --> 01:01:37,108
I guess I'll see you later.

983
01:01:37,143 --> 01:01:39,407
- Yeah.
- All right.

984
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:41,209
I'll see you around.

985
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:43,878
Shit.

986
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:49,046
Have you ever seen
Pearl Harbor at sunset?

987
01:01:49,089 --> 01:01:51,023
Of course.

988
01:01:51,057 --> 01:01:53,457
From the air?

989
01:01:57,430 --> 01:02:00,263
I could get kicked out
of the military for this.

990
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,734
- Really?
- Yeah. Stay down.

991
01:02:22,122 --> 01:02:24,590
The Hawaiians called
this harbor Wai Momi.

992
01:02:24,624 --> 01:02:26,455
It means "water of pearls."

993
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:28,154
It's so beautiful.

994
01:02:28,194 --> 01:02:30,958
My dad took me up
a couple of times.

995
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:32,396
Just don't do what he did.

996
01:02:32,432 --> 01:02:34,024
What do you call it
when you flip over?

997
01:02:34,067 --> 01:02:35,227
A barrel roll?

998
01:02:35,268 --> 01:02:36,565
Yeah.

999
01:02:36,603 --> 01:02:38,935
I won't.

1000
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:52,113
- Oh, God.
- What do you think?

1001
01:02:52,152 --> 01:02:53,847
I like that.

1002
01:03:05,065 --> 01:03:07,363
That plane was supposed
to be back here an hour ago!

1003
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,425
Quick, hide
in the parachute hangar.

1004
01:03:48,942 --> 01:03:51,342
My heart is pounding.

1005
01:04:38,725 --> 01:04:40,886
Danny, last night...

1006
01:04:40,927 --> 01:04:42,952
No, that's terrible.

1007
01:04:44,898 --> 01:04:47,594
Danny, we need
to talk about this.

1008
01:04:49,102 --> 01:04:51,070
Sir. Evelyn!

1009
01:04:51,104 --> 01:04:53,595
- Danny.
- Hey. Hi.

1010
01:04:54,941 --> 01:04:56,135
Hi.

1011
01:04:58,111 --> 01:05:00,045
I didn't sleep a wink
last night.

1012
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:02,605
I had to see you.

1013
01:05:02,649 --> 01:05:05,174
Last night was crazy,
I know, but...

1014
01:05:05,218 --> 01:05:07,482
I'm not sorry. Are you?

1015
01:05:09,556 --> 01:05:11,046
I don't know.

1016
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:17,020
Danny, I had
a wonderful time last night.

1017
01:05:17,063 --> 01:05:18,655
It's just all too fast.

1018
01:05:18,698 --> 01:05:21,326
Listen, Evelyn, I was just down
at the beach this morning...

1019
01:05:21,367 --> 01:05:23,198
and I watched the sun rise...

1020
01:05:23,236 --> 01:05:25,227
and I knew that everything
was gonna be different.

1021
01:05:25,271 --> 01:05:28,900
That this was the start
of something new.

1022
01:05:28,942 --> 01:05:31,911
In this place, in this moment.

1023
01:05:31,945 --> 01:05:35,244
And I don't care what
anybody else says, you know?

1024
01:05:35,281 --> 01:05:38,273
How can I not feel this way?

1025
01:05:39,752 --> 01:05:41,686
I kinda like you.

1026
01:05:44,491 --> 01:05:46,152
Oh, you do?

1027
01:05:50,930 --> 01:05:52,921
You have your tie on crooked.

1028
01:05:56,569 --> 01:05:59,504
Everything's
gonna be all right, OK?

1029
01:06:11,618 --> 01:06:16,112
Do you have any air tours going
through the valley of Oahu?

1030
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:18,714
You do?

1031
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:34,030
Aloha.
This is KGMB in Honolulu...

1032
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:37,304
on another beautiful
fall day here in paradise.

1033
01:06:41,114 --> 01:06:43,582
We have enough information.

1034
01:06:45,618 --> 01:06:47,745
We are returning home.

1035
01:07:16,482 --> 01:07:17,676
Do you ever wonder...

1036
01:07:17,717 --> 01:07:19,548
if this war's
gonna catch up with us?

1037
01:07:20,587 --> 01:07:23,021
Not a whole lot.

1038
01:07:23,056 --> 01:07:27,220
Every moment we're not together,
you're up there training for it.

1039
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:32,427
I'm training
for moments like these...

1040
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:34,092
'cause I have no idea...

1041
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:36,693
how I'm gonna get this car
out of the sand.

1042
01:07:36,736 --> 01:07:38,260
Evelyn, can you please
come out of the bathroom?

1043
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:40,329
You've been there for an hour.

1044
01:07:40,373 --> 01:07:42,933
Evelyn! What are you
trying to do, look like me?

1045
01:07:45,345 --> 01:07:47,279
Are you OK?

1046
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:48,473
Yeah.

1047
01:07:48,514 --> 01:07:50,072
What's the matter?
No, you...

1048
01:07:52,452 --> 01:07:54,420
They call it the vacant sea.

1049
01:07:54,454 --> 01:07:56,445
None of the major sea lanes
go through it...

1050
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:59,390
and you can bury the entire
land mass of Asia there...

1051
01:07:59,425 --> 01:08:01,325
and nobody would know.

1052
01:08:01,361 --> 01:08:04,558
From there,
they could attack anywhere.

1053
01:08:04,597 --> 01:08:06,087
Our last signals intercept...

1054
01:08:06,132 --> 01:08:08,862
indicate that the Japanese
task force is heading south...

1055
01:08:08,901 --> 01:08:10,732
towards the Philippines
or southeast Asia.

1056
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:13,102
But Captain Thurman
of Naval Intelligence here...

1057
01:08:13,139 --> 01:08:14,936
has his own theory
about the missing ships.

1058
01:08:16,109 --> 01:08:18,577
Sir, I believe
they'll try to hit us...

1059
01:08:18,611 --> 01:08:20,636
where it'll hurt us the most...
Pearl Harbor.

1060
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:23,740
It's over 4,000 nautical miles
from Japan to Pearl.

1061
01:08:23,783 --> 01:08:28,083
That's a long distance
to steam a navy, Captain.

1062
01:08:28,121 --> 01:08:30,419
Your theory is based on what?

1063
01:08:30,456 --> 01:08:33,118
Well, it's what I would do.

1064
01:08:33,159 --> 01:08:36,094
That's not exactly
hard evidence, Captain Thurman.

1065
01:08:36,129 --> 01:08:37,596
Admiral,
if I had hard evidence...

1066
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:39,029
we'd already be at war.

1067
01:08:39,065 --> 01:08:40,794
Sir, we can read
their diplomatic codes...

1068
01:08:40,833 --> 01:08:42,164
faster than they can type them.

1069
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:43,828
But Captain Thurman's
cryptology team...

1070
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:45,667
is still trying
to crack the naval codes.

1071
01:08:45,705 --> 01:08:48,606
The intercepts have missing
words and garbled lines...

1072
01:08:48,641 --> 01:08:52,407
so to explain the decrypts,
we have to try to interpret...

1073
01:08:52,445 --> 01:08:53,571
what we think
they're trying to do.

1074
01:08:53,613 --> 01:08:56,776
Interpret?
You mean guess.

1075
01:08:56,816 --> 01:08:59,341
They use
their informed intuition, sir.

1076
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:01,785
We guess.

1077
01:09:01,821 --> 01:09:03,288
It's like playing chess
in the dark.

1078
01:09:03,323 --> 01:09:05,985
Any rumor, troop movement,
ship movement...

1079
01:09:06,025 --> 01:09:08,323
spine-tingle, goose bump,
we pay attention to it.

1080
01:09:08,361 --> 01:09:10,295
When I was in
the Asiatic Fleet...

1081
01:09:10,330 --> 01:09:12,560
the locals used to try
to get outside of a problem...

1082
01:09:12,598 --> 01:09:14,031
to try to see the inside.

1083
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:15,659
Well, I see a strike on Pearl.

1084
01:09:15,702 --> 01:09:17,294
It's the worst thing
that could happen.

1085
01:09:17,337 --> 01:09:18,497
A blow to Pearl
would devastate...

1086
01:09:18,538 --> 01:09:20,904
the Pacific Fleet's
ability to make war.

1087
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:24,239
So, sir, you would have us
mobilize the entire fleet...

1088
01:09:24,277 --> 01:09:27,303
at the cost
of millions of dollars...

1089
01:09:27,347 --> 01:09:29,747
based on this spine-tingling
feeling of yours?

1090
01:09:29,782 --> 01:09:33,684
No, sir. My job is to gather
and interpret material.

1091
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:35,915
Making difficult decisions...

1092
01:09:35,955 --> 01:09:37,445
based on
incomplete information...

1093
01:09:37,490 --> 01:09:40,323
from my limited
decoding ability...

1094
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:42,828
is your job, sir.

1095
01:09:42,862 --> 01:09:45,330
Then break the damn naval code,
Captain...

1096
01:09:45,365 --> 01:09:47,162
so I can make a better decision.

1097
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:50,192
Aye, sir. We are trying.

1098
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:10,118
I wonder if we shouldn't put
the Pacific Fleet on full alert.

1099
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:17,759
In case the optimism...

1100
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:20,630
of the "Honolulu Advertiser"
proves unfounded, gentlemen...

1101
01:10:21,667 --> 01:10:22,964
what are General Short
and the Army...

1102
01:10:23,002 --> 01:10:24,799
going to do
about protecting my ships?

1103
01:10:24,837 --> 01:10:27,328
Within a ten-mile radius
of your harbor...

1104
01:10:27,373 --> 01:10:29,307
we have fighter planes
here at Wheeler...

1105
01:10:29,342 --> 01:10:31,640
bombers at Hickam, and
a training strip at Haleiwa.

1106
01:10:41,954 --> 01:10:43,444
We've recently established
a radar station here...

1107
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:46,583
that can detect planes
125 miles out.

1108
01:10:46,626 --> 01:10:48,924
Which is a month old, Admiral,
and untested.

1109
01:10:48,961 --> 01:10:51,759
I've seen
these new radar screens, Major.

1110
01:10:51,798 --> 01:10:53,425
There's no way of telling
whether they're ours, theirs...

1111
01:10:53,466 --> 01:10:55,161
or a flock of damn birds.

1112
01:10:57,370 --> 01:10:58,997
I'm intercepting
a call from Tokyo...

1113
01:10:59,038 --> 01:11:01,131
to somewhere close by Pearl.

1114
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:02,607
There's a call from Tokyo.

1115
01:11:02,642 --> 01:11:04,007
They say they don't know you.

1116
01:11:06,112 --> 01:11:08,273
Hello?

1117
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,382
It's a local dentist.

1118
01:11:16,422 --> 01:11:19,186
He can see Pearl Harbor
from his office.

1119
01:11:19,225 --> 01:11:21,284
Are there many sailors around?

1120
01:11:26,299 --> 01:11:30,599
The dentist says that
the flat ships are not in port.

1121
01:11:30,636 --> 01:11:33,366
They're talking about
the weather.

1122
01:11:33,406 --> 01:11:35,601
He doesn't seem to know
who he's talking to.

1123
01:11:35,641 --> 01:11:37,370
Hello?

1124
01:11:41,414 --> 01:11:43,780
That was a strange call.

1125
01:11:46,052 --> 01:11:47,815
Admiral,
may I speak to you in private?

1126
01:11:49,255 --> 01:11:50,847
Why would a spy use a phone?

1127
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:52,551
They know we tap
all international lines.

1128
01:11:52,592 --> 01:11:54,822
Our listeners feel
it's probably not code talk.

1129
01:11:54,861 --> 01:11:56,556
It sounds like someone in Japan
is sneaking around...

1130
01:11:56,596 --> 01:11:58,791
asking a local citizen
the location of our carriers.

1131
01:11:58,831 --> 01:12:01,197
That makes me feel
all warm inside.

1132
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:04,067
Get the FBI on it immediately.

1133
01:12:04,103 --> 01:12:06,401
Have we found
the goddamn Japanese Fleet yet?

1134
01:12:06,439 --> 01:12:08,999
No, Admiral. The bases are
looking all over the Pacific.

1135
01:12:09,041 --> 01:12:10,975
So the entire fleet could be
rounding Diamond Head...

1136
01:12:11,010 --> 01:12:13,069
and we wouldn't know
a thing about it.

1137
01:12:13,112 --> 01:12:14,306
Get on it.

1138
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:50,806
I'm alive.

1139
01:12:50,850 --> 01:12:53,011
This is the first
I could get word out.

1140
01:13:53,112 --> 01:13:55,205
I told you I'd come back.

1141
01:13:58,651 --> 01:14:00,812
Here, sit down. Come here.

1142
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:03,413
It's OK.

1143
01:14:03,456 --> 01:14:05,424
It's all right.

1144
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:09,459
You're real.

1145
01:14:09,495 --> 01:14:11,360
Yeah.

1146
01:14:12,798 --> 01:14:14,459
I wished for this every day.

1147
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:15,831
I know. Me, too.

1148
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:18,496
Every second. So did I.

1149
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:20,767
I thought you were dead.

1150
01:14:20,806 --> 01:14:22,671
They said you were shot down
in the sea.

1151
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:24,869
I was.

1152
01:14:24,910 --> 01:14:27,879
I was in the ocean.
It was so cold.

1153
01:14:27,913 --> 01:14:30,177
I missed you.

1154
01:14:30,216 --> 01:14:33,344
I got picked up
by a French fishing boat...

1155
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:36,378
and I was in occupied France,
and I couldn't get word out.

1156
01:14:36,422 --> 01:14:38,788
I'll tell you all about it,
I promise.

1157
01:14:38,824 --> 01:14:40,655
But I'm fine. I'm OK.

1158
01:14:40,693 --> 01:14:43,560
And I'm here now.

1159
01:14:43,596 --> 01:14:45,791
I just wanted to see you.

1160
01:14:45,831 --> 01:14:48,732
You're so beautiful.

1161
01:15:04,050 --> 01:15:05,745
I love you.

1162
01:15:09,722 --> 01:15:12,850
Hey, it's OK.

1163
01:15:12,892 --> 01:15:14,723
Evelyn, I'm back.

1164
01:15:15,995 --> 01:15:19,396
It's OK. I won't leave you
again, I promise.

1165
01:15:20,566 --> 01:15:22,056
Rafe, you died.

1166
01:15:25,204 --> 01:15:26,933
And so did I.

1167
01:15:26,972 --> 01:15:30,965
I know, but it's fine now.
I'm back.

1168
01:15:32,011 --> 01:15:33,273
We're together.

1169
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:42,553
I mean, we are together...

1170
01:15:42,588 --> 01:15:43,850
right?

1171
01:15:46,592 --> 01:15:48,719
I don't know where I am.

1172
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:29,497
Stay away.

1173
01:16:36,308 --> 01:16:38,367
This is Radio Honolulu...

1174
01:16:38,410 --> 01:16:39,775
playing the sweetest music...

1175
01:16:39,812 --> 01:16:42,713
on the sweetest island
in the Pacific.

1176
01:16:42,748 --> 01:16:44,875
It's a beautiful
December 6th...

1177
01:16:44,917 --> 01:16:46,782
with beautiful music...

1178
01:16:59,932 --> 01:17:02,025
God damn it. There you go.

1179
01:17:02,067 --> 01:17:04,194
A real live ace!

1180
01:17:05,504 --> 01:17:08,166
An ace is only five.
I shot down six M.E.s.

1181
01:17:08,207 --> 01:17:10,869
And I got two smokers, too.
They don't count them.

1182
01:17:10,910 --> 01:17:13,378
Of course, I got shot down
myself before they could pin me.

1183
01:17:13,412 --> 01:17:15,403
So you got back
from behind enemy lines?

1184
01:17:15,447 --> 01:17:17,711
What's that combat like?
Were you scared?

1185
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:21,015
Hey! One at a time.

1186
01:17:21,053 --> 01:17:23,112
Them Luftwaffe boys
can fly pretty good.

1187
01:17:23,155 --> 01:17:24,747
It's not like training.

1188
01:17:24,790 --> 01:17:25,984
They're...

1189
01:17:31,564 --> 01:17:33,395
They're all about tactics
is what it is.

1190
01:17:33,432 --> 01:17:35,366
See, the Nazis, right,
they're faster than you are...

1191
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:37,301
so they'll disappear
and they get up in the soup...

1192
01:17:37,336 --> 01:17:38,803
and they'll throw like
a roll or a hammerhead...

1193
01:17:38,838 --> 01:17:41,102
and they'll come around
on your high side...

1194
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:44,132
shoot you from behind...
like some Americans will.

1195
01:17:51,183 --> 01:17:53,674
Gooz, you're lookin'
at a real live ace.

1196
01:17:53,719 --> 01:17:56,085
Let me give you
the shirt off my back!

1197
01:17:57,823 --> 01:17:59,347
Aloha! There you go!

1198
01:17:59,391 --> 01:18:00,790
I'll take it from you.

1199
01:18:00,826 --> 01:18:02,851
I can see how y'all been
spending your time out here.

1200
01:18:02,895 --> 01:18:04,362
Hey, Rafe,
we gotta talk, all right?

1201
01:18:04,396 --> 01:18:07,297
I got nothin' to talk
about with you. Here.

1202
01:18:08,901 --> 01:18:11,461
Why don't you have a drink?

1203
01:18:11,503 --> 01:18:13,368
I'll make a toast.

1204
01:18:13,405 --> 01:18:15,703
To returning from the dead.

1205
01:18:15,741 --> 01:18:19,609
Wasn't all I expected,
but that's life.

1206
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:23,312
To my best friend
and loyal buddy Danny...

1207
01:18:23,349 --> 01:18:26,147
for keepin' up the war effort
back here at home.

1208
01:18:32,825 --> 01:18:33,985
Where I come from...

1209
01:18:34,026 --> 01:18:35,584
somebody makes a toast to you
and you don't drink...

1210
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:37,152
that's sayin' something.

1211
01:18:37,196 --> 01:18:40,222
All right, Rafe.

1212
01:18:40,266 --> 01:18:42,894
That's how it's gonna be.

1213
01:18:42,935 --> 01:18:44,459
To you.

1214
01:18:44,503 --> 01:18:45,936
You guys need to spend
some time alone, I think.

1215
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:48,064
Hell, no, Red. Come on.

1216
01:18:48,107 --> 01:18:50,667
No, we're celebratin' here.

1217
01:18:50,709 --> 01:18:52,802
Me over there fightin'...

1218
01:18:52,845 --> 01:18:54,904
almost gettin' killed...

1219
01:18:54,947 --> 01:18:56,778
my friend Danny back here...

1220
01:18:56,815 --> 01:18:58,976
Iookin' after my interests
for me.

1221
01:18:59,018 --> 01:19:00,144
Y'all know Danny
was even good enough...

1222
01:19:00,185 --> 01:19:02,676
to look out for my girl for me
while I was gone?

1223
01:19:02,721 --> 01:19:05,519
We thought you were dead, Rafe.
And it gutted us both.

1224
01:19:05,557 --> 01:19:08,287
And we were just tryin'
to get on with our lives.

1225
01:19:08,327 --> 01:19:09,919
Life is good, ain't it, Danny?

1226
01:19:09,962 --> 01:19:12,157
You're a rotten drunk.
You always have been.

1227
01:19:12,197 --> 01:19:15,360
You're a lousy friend.
That's a new development.

1228
01:19:17,136 --> 01:19:19,696
You left her to fight
somebody else's war...

1229
01:19:19,738 --> 01:19:21,433
and you made damn sure
that I didn't go with you...

1230
01:19:21,473 --> 01:19:22,963
and we thought
that you were dead...

1231
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:25,169
I almost did die,
you little son of a bitch!

1232
01:19:25,210 --> 01:19:27,644
And her face was the last thing
that went through my mind...

1233
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:29,671
so don't stand there and tell
me to act like it's all right!

1234
01:19:29,715 --> 01:19:31,910
Yeah, Rafe, I stayed.

1235
01:19:31,951 --> 01:19:33,919
I stayed,
and you made sure of that...

1236
01:19:33,953 --> 01:19:35,181
and some things changed.

1237
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:37,085
And I hope
you can get used to that.

1238
01:19:37,122 --> 01:19:39,056
I have to get used to it?

1239
01:19:39,091 --> 01:19:42,618
All right. We'll see
how I can get used to it.

1240
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:45,861
Get used to that, boy!

1241
01:19:47,499 --> 01:19:48,693
And that's my left hand, too!

1242
01:19:48,734 --> 01:19:50,759
Hey, come on!

1243
01:19:55,774 --> 01:19:58,800
Melee at the Hula-la.
Send M.P. S!

1244
01:20:01,714 --> 01:20:04,444
- You called me a lousy friend?
- Get your hands off!

1245
01:20:07,186 --> 01:20:08,346
Shit!

1246
01:20:10,255 --> 01:20:11,722
Come on, Danny!

1247
01:20:17,262 --> 01:20:18,627
Let's go get 'em.

1248
01:20:19,832 --> 01:20:21,197
Let's move out!

1249
01:20:23,202 --> 01:20:25,568
Oh, no. They're gonna
throw us in the brig.

1250
01:20:25,604 --> 01:20:27,003
Let's get outta here.

1251
01:21:12,885 --> 01:21:14,682
Shit.

1252
01:21:18,757 --> 01:21:20,725
You're the only family I got.

1253
01:21:20,759 --> 01:21:23,125
When you were gone...

1254
01:21:23,162 --> 01:21:25,426
it was the loneliest
I'd ever been.

1255
01:21:25,464 --> 01:21:27,557
The same for her, too.

1256
01:21:27,599 --> 01:21:30,090
Oh, boy, now you're really
breakin' my heart.

1257
01:21:30,135 --> 01:21:32,330
If you hadn't gone,
none of this woulda happened.

1258
01:21:32,371 --> 01:21:34,168
So it's my fault, I guess.

1259
01:21:35,441 --> 01:21:36,806
Damn it, Rafe.

1260
01:21:41,113 --> 01:21:44,571
I just know
there's got to be some way...

1261
01:21:44,616 --> 01:21:48,017
we can work things out
so that...

1262
01:21:48,053 --> 01:21:49,953
things could be right
between me and you.

1263
01:21:50,989 --> 01:21:53,617
I just don't see how
it could ever be the same.

1264
01:22:02,201 --> 01:22:03,532
Revered father...

1265
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:10,904
I go now to fulfill my mission
and my destiny.

1266
01:22:12,478 --> 01:22:14,070
I hope it is a destiny...

1267
01:22:14,113 --> 01:22:16,377
that will bring honor
to our family...

1268
01:22:16,415 --> 01:22:18,906
and if it requires my life...

1269
01:22:18,951 --> 01:22:20,714
I will sacrifice it gladly...

1270
01:22:20,752 --> 01:22:23,118
to be a good servant
of our nation.

1271
01:23:46,405 --> 01:23:47,895
We got a large haze.

1272
01:23:50,776 --> 01:23:52,744
That's too big
to be planes, right?

1273
01:23:57,182 --> 01:23:59,912
Is that what you wanna do?
Knight to knight five?

1274
01:23:59,952 --> 01:24:01,146
Wrong move.

1275
01:24:01,186 --> 01:24:03,086
Lieutenant,
radar's picking up...

1276
01:24:03,121 --> 01:24:05,112
a large return
moving in from the northeast.

1277
01:24:05,157 --> 01:24:07,022
Hang on.

1278
01:24:07,059 --> 01:24:08,617
Relax.

1279
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:11,128
It's a flight of B-17 s
coming in from the mainland.

1280
01:24:12,998 --> 01:24:14,795
Nothing to worry about.

1281
01:24:14,833 --> 01:24:16,425
A heck of a lot of B-17 s.

1282
01:24:18,704 --> 01:24:20,399
Good shot, Hop.

1283
01:24:23,408 --> 01:24:25,569
This better be good, Commander.

1284
01:24:27,045 --> 01:24:29,240
One of our destroyers reports
having fired and sunk...

1285
01:24:29,281 --> 01:24:33,308
enemy submarine attempting
to enter Pearl Harbor at 0653.

1286
01:24:33,352 --> 01:24:34,478
It's 7:20!

1287
01:24:34,519 --> 01:24:35,918
We had decoder delays, Admiral.

1288
01:24:35,954 --> 01:24:37,683
Relay this to Washington.
Recall the staff.

1289
01:24:41,793 --> 01:24:43,522
"Failure...

1290
01:24:43,562 --> 01:24:45,189
"Peace talks...

1291
01:24:45,230 --> 01:24:46,754
"useless."

1292
01:24:48,934 --> 01:24:51,266
Thurman here.
Tokyo transmitting...

1293
01:24:51,303 --> 01:24:52,861
to their embassy
in Washington...

1294
01:24:52,904 --> 01:24:54,895
"Discontinue use
of your decoding machine...

1295
01:24:54,940 --> 01:24:56,430
"and dispose of immediately.

1296
01:24:56,475 --> 01:24:58,568
"Special emphasis
on destroying important parts."

1297
01:24:58,610 --> 01:25:00,043
Do you read that?
Acknowledge.

1298
01:25:07,319 --> 01:25:08,616
Admiral...

1299
01:25:08,654 --> 01:25:10,121
Naval Intel intercepted
a transmission from Tokyo...

1300
01:25:10,155 --> 01:25:11,986
to the Japanese embassy
in Washington...

1301
01:25:12,024 --> 01:25:14,686
instructing them to break apart
all decoder machines...

1302
01:25:14,726 --> 01:25:16,819
and burn all secret documents.

1303
01:25:16,862 --> 01:25:19,797
The Japanese
are expecting a war.

1304
01:25:19,831 --> 01:25:21,856
Should we?

1305
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:09,777
Warning of possible...

1306
01:26:09,815 --> 01:26:12,545
Japanese aggressive movement
in any direction.

1307
01:26:12,584 --> 01:26:15,178
"Broken relationship.
Hostilities imminent."

1308
01:26:15,220 --> 01:26:17,017
But where?

1309
01:26:55,827 --> 01:26:57,954
Did you ever lose a fight,
Miller?

1310
01:26:59,765 --> 01:27:02,097
I been lucky so far, Captain.

1311
01:27:02,134 --> 01:27:03,761
From what I hear, it ain't luck.

1312
01:27:05,437 --> 01:27:07,405
Ship's proud of you, son.

1313
01:27:41,606 --> 01:27:43,574
Why the hell's the Navy...

1314
01:27:43,608 --> 01:27:46,270
doing practice this early
on a Sunday?

1315
01:28:40,398 --> 01:28:41,558
Get down!

1316
01:28:48,874 --> 01:28:50,739
Go!

1317
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:54,605
I'm with Navy newsreel,
and I can tell you one thing...

1318
01:28:54,646 --> 01:28:56,273
them ain't Navy planes!

1319
01:29:00,552 --> 01:29:02,144
All hands,
man your battle stations!

1320
01:29:02,187 --> 01:29:03,677
We're being bombed!

1321
01:29:03,722 --> 01:29:04,882
Get up!

1322
01:29:17,002 --> 01:29:19,266
Jesus Christ!

1323
01:29:28,613 --> 01:29:29,739
Man your battle stations.

1324
01:29:29,781 --> 01:29:31,646
Another dumb drill.

1325
01:29:48,366 --> 01:29:49,958
All hands,
man your battle stations.

1326
01:29:50,001 --> 01:29:52,231
- What the heck was that?
- It's a bomb!

1327
01:29:54,673 --> 01:29:56,937
Move!

1328
01:30:00,679 --> 01:30:02,010
Son of a bi...

1329
01:30:07,919 --> 01:30:10,149
From outside!

1330
01:30:10,188 --> 01:30:12,418
Get me the engine room!

1331
01:30:14,559 --> 01:30:16,254
My God.

1332
01:30:16,294 --> 01:30:18,489
Take cover!

1333
01:30:18,530 --> 01:30:21,090
Down!

1334
01:30:21,132 --> 01:30:24,260
Report battle stations!
Manned and ready!

1335
01:30:24,302 --> 01:30:25,826
Man your battle stations!

1336
01:30:25,870 --> 01:30:29,135
This is no shit!
They just sunk the Arizona!

1337
01:30:29,174 --> 01:30:30,573
General quarters!

1338
01:30:30,609 --> 01:30:32,577
All hands,
man your battle stations!

1339
01:30:32,611 --> 01:30:34,135
This is no damn drill!

1340
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:38,208
Go!

1341
01:30:39,851 --> 01:30:42,115
They look like Japs.

1342
01:30:42,153 --> 01:30:44,815
I didn't even know
the Japs were sore at us!

1343
01:30:44,856 --> 01:30:46,847
Danny, you just get me
to a goddamn airplane!

1344
01:30:50,228 --> 01:30:51,388
Holy God!

1345
01:30:51,429 --> 01:30:53,863
This is good footage.
Did you see that?

1346
01:30:53,898 --> 01:30:55,229
Holy cow!

1347
01:30:55,266 --> 01:30:57,200
I hope
there's still an airfield left.

1348
01:31:36,608 --> 01:31:39,099
Hurry up!
What in the world?

1349
01:31:41,379 --> 01:31:42,937
Look! So many!

1350
01:31:52,157 --> 01:31:54,955
Everybody to the hospital!

1351
01:32:07,639 --> 01:32:09,539
Why's the Navy
always buzzin' us?

1352
01:32:10,842 --> 01:32:12,810
Shut up, Red!

1353
01:32:14,479 --> 01:32:17,414
Red, it's too early.

1354
01:32:17,449 --> 01:32:19,314
The Japs are here!

1355
01:32:21,186 --> 01:32:23,313
What the hell? Let's go!

1356
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:01,314
- Get corpsmen to the bridge.
- Aye, Captain!

1357
01:33:09,134 --> 01:33:12,035
Repair says third deck
is flooding port side!

1358
01:33:32,357 --> 01:33:34,484
Get up, you cowards!
Get up there and fight!

1359
01:33:34,526 --> 01:33:35,686
Move it!

1360
01:33:39,664 --> 01:33:41,291
Take cover!

1361
01:33:48,940 --> 01:33:50,373
I got you, Captain.

1362
01:33:50,408 --> 01:33:51,807
You radio for air cover!

1363
01:33:51,843 --> 01:33:54,403
Initiate damage control!

1364
01:33:54,445 --> 01:33:57,414
Find my X.O.
Tell him to assume command.

1365
01:33:57,448 --> 01:33:58,676
And you make sure the gunners...

1366
01:33:58,716 --> 01:34:01,116
Everyone's where
they need to be, Captain.

1367
01:34:01,152 --> 01:34:04,019
You trained us well.

1368
01:34:06,925 --> 01:34:08,358
Captain...

1369
01:34:41,226 --> 01:34:43,217
Go!

1370
01:34:43,261 --> 01:34:46,458
Let's go! Everybody move!

1371
01:34:48,399 --> 01:34:51,391
Get the ammo
for that fifty cal!

1372
01:34:59,277 --> 01:35:00,437
Let's go! We gotta get...

1373
01:35:04,582 --> 01:35:07,107
Come on, man, we gotta
get this thing loaded up!

1374
01:35:22,867 --> 01:35:24,767
Let's go!

1375
01:35:27,205 --> 01:35:29,230
Come on! Let's go!

1376
01:35:51,462 --> 01:35:53,293
Come on!

1377
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:05,108
Danny,
get me into a damn plane!

1378
01:36:05,143 --> 01:36:07,168
Come on!

1379
01:36:17,221 --> 01:36:20,418
Get some ammo up here!
We need some men on these guns!

1380
01:36:20,458 --> 01:36:23,359
Sir! The captain says
you're in charge, sir!

1381
01:36:23,394 --> 01:36:25,794
We need more ammo! Now!

1382
01:36:25,830 --> 01:36:28,822
Send up ammunition
for the five-inch guns!

1383
01:36:31,169 --> 01:36:32,693
Medic!

1384
01:36:32,737 --> 01:36:33,931
All of 'em, now!

1385
01:37:00,932 --> 01:37:02,559
Come on!

1386
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:07,936
Come on, you sum'bitch!

1387
01:37:17,615 --> 01:37:20,641
I need a doctor!
Somebody help me!

1388
01:37:23,888 --> 01:37:26,550
Get to the supply room!

1389
01:37:26,591 --> 01:37:29,754
Get everything out!

1390
01:37:35,233 --> 01:37:37,599
Planes incoming!

1391
01:37:41,139 --> 01:37:43,073
Cut 'em down!

1392
01:37:43,107 --> 01:37:46,099
Come on!
Get 'em away from the windows!

1393
01:37:52,517 --> 01:37:54,951
The mattresses!
Get 'em against the wall!

1394
01:37:58,623 --> 01:38:00,716
Take cover!

1395
01:38:08,066 --> 01:38:10,330
Is everybody all right?

1396
01:38:10,368 --> 01:38:12,700
Can you stand?

1397
01:38:14,536 --> 01:38:15,833
Hold your fire!

1398
01:38:15,871 --> 01:38:17,532
Get to the gun! Hurry up!

1399
01:38:19,474 --> 01:38:20,998
Get down, Danny!

1400
01:38:30,018 --> 01:38:32,316
- Earl!
- This is Walker!

1401
01:38:32,354 --> 01:38:34,720
We need to get those planes
fueled and loaded right now!

1402
01:38:34,756 --> 01:38:36,849
What's going on out there?

1403
01:38:36,892 --> 01:38:38,359
Danny,
what the hell's that noise?

1404
01:38:38,393 --> 01:38:40,020
You guys doin' target practice
or something?

1405
01:38:40,062 --> 01:38:41,791
I think World War II
just hit us.

1406
01:38:50,238 --> 01:38:52,729
Go!

1407
01:39:00,148 --> 01:39:01,911
- Billy!
- Run!

1408
01:39:01,950 --> 01:39:05,181
- It's gonna blow!
- It's a dud.

1409
01:39:16,832 --> 01:39:18,060
Come on, get down!

1410
01:39:18,100 --> 01:39:20,568
Danny, are you all right?

1411
01:39:20,602 --> 01:39:21,728
I'm all right!

1412
01:39:21,770 --> 01:39:23,465
Come on, let's go!

1413
01:39:23,505 --> 01:39:25,735
Gooz, come on, man!

1414
01:39:49,431 --> 01:39:52,832
We're sinking!

1415
01:40:00,575 --> 01:40:03,874
Stay together!
Close the hatches!

1416
01:40:18,026 --> 01:40:20,085
- I can't swim!
- Just hang on!

1417
01:40:33,108 --> 01:40:35,576
Let's move it now!

1418
01:40:35,610 --> 01:40:37,271
Joe! Go!

1419
01:40:37,312 --> 01:40:39,439
We're gettin' outta here!
Get in the car!

1420
01:40:39,481 --> 01:40:40,812
Get in!

1421
01:40:40,849 --> 01:40:42,214
Come on, let's go!

1422
01:40:42,250 --> 01:40:44,309
Get out of the way!

1423
01:40:44,352 --> 01:40:46,912
Come on!

1424
01:40:46,955 --> 01:40:48,252
Where's this place we're goin'?

1425
01:40:48,290 --> 01:40:50,781
We got a small mechanic runway
about ten minutes away.

1426
01:40:50,826 --> 01:40:52,589
Hasn't been hit yet.

1427
01:40:58,100 --> 01:40:59,897
We got Zeros on our six!

1428
01:41:05,107 --> 01:41:06,369
Duck!

1429
01:41:32,968 --> 01:41:34,902
Help us!

1430
01:42:01,329 --> 01:42:02,694
We're trapped.

1431
01:42:04,599 --> 01:42:06,726
Try the door!

1432
01:42:33,862 --> 01:42:36,194
Oh, my God! I'm going under!

1433
01:42:41,570 --> 01:42:42,901
It's sucking me back!

1434
01:42:43,905 --> 01:42:46,396
The current's too strong!

1435
01:43:00,222 --> 01:43:01,382
They're shootin' at us!

1436
01:43:09,564 --> 01:43:11,759
I don't wanna die!

1437
01:43:41,863 --> 01:43:43,763
This is it.

1438
01:43:43,798 --> 01:43:45,288
Get us out of here now!

1439
01:44:09,190 --> 01:44:11,055
How bad?

1440
01:44:11,092 --> 01:44:13,390
It's still not over, sir.

1441
01:44:17,365 --> 01:44:21,426
An entire fleet at anchor.

1442
01:44:21,469 --> 01:44:24,495
My God...

1443
01:44:47,262 --> 01:44:50,231
Barbara, fill every syringe
you can find with morphine!

1444
01:44:53,368 --> 01:44:55,768
Fill up the kitchen!
Are you listening to me?

1445
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:07,981
Over there!

1446
01:45:14,522 --> 01:45:16,422
We got a bad neck wound here!

1447
01:45:16,458 --> 01:45:18,483
Surgery! Move!

1448
01:45:18,526 --> 01:45:21,120
Get him to surgery!
Oh, God.

1449
01:45:21,162 --> 01:45:22,891
In here!

1450
01:45:22,931 --> 01:45:25,798
He's still bleeding!
Another hemostat!

1451
01:45:25,834 --> 01:45:28,234
Hurry!
Give me a hemostat now!

1452
01:45:31,039 --> 01:45:32,939
Damn it, hurry!

1453
01:45:35,010 --> 01:45:38,844
Gimme another hemostat!
Another suture! Hurry!

1454
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:42,008
God, I'm so sorry!

1455
01:45:46,921 --> 01:45:48,548
Doctor!

1456
01:45:48,590 --> 01:45:50,956
Here!

1457
01:45:57,932 --> 01:46:00,526
Am I gonna die?

1458
01:46:00,568 --> 01:46:02,195
Nurse!

1459
01:46:07,509 --> 01:46:09,067
Don't leave me!

1460
01:46:09,110 --> 01:46:11,704
Doctor! Get over here!

1461
01:46:13,915 --> 01:46:15,212
My fingers
are plugging his artery!

1462
01:46:16,451 --> 01:46:18,078
Doctor, what do you need?

1463
01:46:19,621 --> 01:46:21,919
Focus, look at me.
What do you need?

1464
01:46:21,956 --> 01:46:24,516
- Hemostat.
- Hemostat.

1465
01:46:26,828 --> 01:46:30,286
Here. All right, look at me.
You're going to be all right.

1466
01:46:41,109 --> 01:46:43,976
I need more ammo, ladies!

1467
01:46:47,148 --> 01:46:49,742
Earl! We good to go?

1468
01:46:49,784 --> 01:46:51,479
- Mostly, but...
- Get down!

1469
01:46:51,519 --> 01:46:53,578
- Shit! Get cover!
- Jesus!

1470
01:46:56,558 --> 01:46:59,118
- Come on, you guys!
- Earl, get in here!

1471
01:47:02,063 --> 01:47:04,964
Sergeant!
We need more than a shotgun!

1472
01:47:04,999 --> 01:47:07,490
You got any other weapons
for cover fire?

1473
01:47:07,535 --> 01:47:09,196
Inside that ammo locker!

1474
01:47:09,237 --> 01:47:11,535
- Come on!
- Move it!

1475
01:47:13,408 --> 01:47:15,899
- Go!
- Get the guns out!

1476
01:47:15,944 --> 01:47:19,277
You said the planes
are mostly ready, but what?

1477
01:47:19,314 --> 01:47:20,474
She's down, she's broke,
she's shit.

1478
01:47:20,515 --> 01:47:21,914
I got four left.

1479
01:47:21,950 --> 01:47:24,384
One's good, two need ammo,
one needs fuel.

1480
01:47:24,419 --> 01:47:26,546
Fall out
and load up in the bunker!

1481
01:47:26,588 --> 01:47:28,021
Let's go! Get down!

1482
01:47:28,056 --> 01:47:30,923
- Move!
- Get ready to roll this thing!

1483
01:47:30,959 --> 01:47:33,621
Get down! Now!

1484
01:47:33,661 --> 01:47:37,654
Anthony, Red, you stay here
and man the fifty-caliber.

1485
01:47:37,699 --> 01:47:41,931
Gooz, get to the next bunker
and lay down some cover fire.

1486
01:47:41,970 --> 01:47:43,130
Planes.

1487
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:47,738
Should we fire?

1488
01:47:47,775 --> 01:47:50,175
Stay down! God damn it!
Hold your fire!

1489
01:47:50,211 --> 01:47:51,405
Stay still! Nobody fire!

1490
01:47:51,446 --> 01:47:53,607
Oh, God.

1491
01:47:57,352 --> 01:47:58,944
They don't know we're here.

1492
01:47:59,621 --> 01:48:01,452
- Stay down.
- Fire?

1493
01:48:01,489 --> 01:48:04,185
No, God damn it,
stay down, stay still.

1494
01:48:04,225 --> 01:48:05,385
Don't fire.

1495
01:48:09,797 --> 01:48:11,059
Oh, God.

1496
01:48:20,074 --> 01:48:22,008
I don't see any ordnance.

1497
01:48:22,043 --> 01:48:23,442
I think they're going home.

1498
01:48:23,478 --> 01:48:26,242
No. They'll be back. We still
got planes on the ground.

1499
01:48:26,281 --> 01:48:28,374
Pilots, listen up.

1500
01:48:28,416 --> 01:48:30,509
Get all the speed
you can on the runway...

1501
01:48:30,552 --> 01:48:32,349
don't get on the stick
till the very end.

1502
01:48:32,387 --> 01:48:35,015
In the air, stay low
between the buildings.

1503
01:48:35,056 --> 01:48:36,717
You see any Zero on your tail...

1504
01:48:36,758 --> 01:48:40,524
wipe him off, don't freeze.
Just keep moving.

1505
01:48:40,562 --> 01:48:45,158
Try to separate 'em,
take 'em out one by one.

1506
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:48,101
P-40s can't outrun Zeros,
so don't try.

1507
01:48:48,136 --> 01:48:49,467
We have to outfly 'em.

1508
01:48:49,504 --> 01:48:51,495
We got high-level bombers!

1509
01:48:51,539 --> 01:48:52,699
They'll bust this hangar
wide open!

1510
01:48:52,740 --> 01:48:54,605
Grab the fifties! Let's move!

1511
01:48:56,644 --> 01:48:58,578
Move!

1512
01:48:58,613 --> 01:49:01,104
Go!

1513
01:49:03,851 --> 01:49:05,614
Zeros!

1514
01:49:05,653 --> 01:49:07,780
Take cover!

1515
01:49:17,465 --> 01:49:20,161
Take cover!

1516
01:49:31,713 --> 01:49:34,341
- Get down!
- Let's go! In the box!

1517
01:49:56,137 --> 01:49:57,764
Come on!

1518
01:49:57,805 --> 01:49:58,999
Come on, buddy!

1519
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:01,668
Leave him, he's dead!

1520
01:50:09,550 --> 01:50:11,245
They're kicking our butt.

1521
01:50:11,286 --> 01:50:13,948
Get to the airplanes! Go!

1522
01:50:15,723 --> 01:50:18,157
Run! Red, Anthony, let's go!

1523
01:50:22,063 --> 01:50:25,362
Come on, help me!
Goddamn belts!

1524
01:50:29,037 --> 01:50:30,470
Let's go! Come on!

1525
01:50:38,413 --> 01:50:39,880
Knock 'em dead.

1526
01:50:39,914 --> 01:50:41,643
Quick! Get in! Put this on!

1527
01:50:43,251 --> 01:50:46,880
They're coming around.
Bring 'em out! Let's go!

1528
01:50:53,795 --> 01:50:56,525
Red, get out of here,
God damn it! Go!

1529
01:50:59,067 --> 01:51:01,331
Come on, let's go.

1530
01:51:01,369 --> 01:51:02,836
Joe, get out the way!

1531
01:51:02,870 --> 01:51:04,360
I'm rollin'!

1532
01:51:06,774 --> 01:51:08,401
Clear! Go!

1533
01:51:08,443 --> 01:51:09,876
God. Planes!

1534
01:51:11,612 --> 01:51:12,806
Come on, help me!

1535
01:51:15,550 --> 01:51:19,042
Hey, Joe! You got three Zeros
behind you!

1536
01:51:28,830 --> 01:51:31,060
Turn!

1537
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:33,560
Oh, God!

1538
01:51:45,346 --> 01:51:46,472
Shit.

1539
01:51:46,514 --> 01:51:48,709
What are you doing? Get going!

1540
01:51:48,750 --> 01:51:51,617
Danny, start that thing up
and get in the air.

1541
01:51:51,652 --> 01:51:53,279
I'm not much good without
a wing man. I need you!

1542
01:51:53,321 --> 01:51:54,481
I got you!

1543
01:51:56,190 --> 01:51:58,249
Let's do it!

1544
01:52:16,277 --> 01:52:18,404
It's real tight, Rafe!

1545
01:52:33,461 --> 01:52:35,691
Hey, Rafe, I'm not sure
we have enough runway!

1546
01:52:35,730 --> 01:52:37,755
Get your airspeed up
before you leave the dirt!

1547
01:52:37,799 --> 01:52:39,994
Don't freeze.

1548
01:52:44,238 --> 01:52:46,866
I don't think
I'm gonna make it over!

1549
01:52:46,908 --> 01:52:48,239
Come on!

1550
01:52:57,752 --> 01:52:59,310
We did it! I'm up!

1551
01:53:01,355 --> 01:53:03,220
We got Zeros behind us!

1552
01:53:05,059 --> 01:53:06,458
How many you see back there?

1553
01:53:10,998 --> 01:53:12,363
We got five on our six!

1554
01:53:18,539 --> 01:53:20,530
Take it down to the deck, now!

1555
01:53:29,083 --> 01:53:30,607
We gotta split 'em up.

1556
01:53:31,752 --> 01:53:32,912
You take left, I'll take right.

1557
01:53:38,860 --> 01:53:41,658
Earl, get some guns
in that goddamn tower!

1558
01:53:41,696 --> 01:53:45,097
OK! Let's go! Into the truck!

1559
01:53:50,938 --> 01:53:52,565
Danny, I got three on my six.

1560
01:54:13,928 --> 01:54:16,795
Stop! Let's go!

1561
01:54:16,831 --> 01:54:18,321
Move it, Red!

1562
01:54:19,934 --> 01:54:21,458
- Let's go!
- Gimme the fifty!

1563
01:54:23,337 --> 01:54:26,067
Let's go! All right!

1564
01:54:29,710 --> 01:54:31,701
I still got two behind me, Rafe.

1565
01:54:45,593 --> 01:54:47,561
Son of a bitch!

1566
01:54:56,270 --> 01:54:59,296
Earl, God damn it,
get some guns in that tower!

1567
01:54:59,340 --> 01:55:01,900
On the tower.
Going ten stories up.

1568
01:55:01,943 --> 01:55:03,376
It's a long son of a bitch.

1569
01:55:11,953 --> 01:55:14,114
Rafe, they're all over me!
I can't get them off me!

1570
01:55:22,296 --> 01:55:23,854
Danny,
I still got three on my tail!

1571
01:55:27,735 --> 01:55:29,293
Keep jinking it!
Don't let them get a handle!

1572
01:55:29,337 --> 01:55:30,861
I can't shake 'em!

1573
01:55:32,340 --> 01:55:33,602
God damn it.

1574
01:55:35,042 --> 01:55:37,602
Danny, let's play chicken
with these Jap suckers!

1575
01:55:37,645 --> 01:55:39,135
I'm with you.

1576
01:55:41,048 --> 01:55:42,640
Jesus!

1577
01:55:46,821 --> 01:55:49,221
- I'm coming right at you!
- Don't brake till I tell you.

1578
01:55:51,025 --> 01:55:52,185
Not yet!

1579
01:55:53,260 --> 01:55:54,420
Come on!

1580
01:55:55,997 --> 01:55:57,191
Go left! Now!

1581
01:56:01,702 --> 01:56:04,728
We got 'em!

1582
01:56:04,772 --> 01:56:06,069
Set up over there!

1583
01:56:08,843 --> 01:56:10,435
Come on, load it!

1584
01:56:10,478 --> 01:56:11,638
We're on the tower.

1585
01:56:13,848 --> 01:56:16,510
I got one on my tail.
I'll bring him right by you.

1586
01:56:16,550 --> 01:56:20,418
He's comin' around!
Let's get this Jap sucker!

1587
01:56:23,691 --> 01:56:25,818
Hold your fire. Here he comes.

1588
01:56:27,261 --> 01:56:29,491
You better be cocked and locked
when I come by!

1589
01:56:31,899 --> 01:56:33,230
Hold your fire!

1590
01:56:34,869 --> 01:56:36,200
Fire!

1591
01:56:43,778 --> 01:56:45,746
Good shootin', boys!

1592
01:56:45,780 --> 01:56:47,543
Nice shot, Earl!

1593
01:56:47,581 --> 01:56:49,014
Let's head over
to battleship row!

1594
01:56:49,050 --> 01:56:50,210
I'm with you!

1595
01:56:58,926 --> 01:57:00,723
Let's go do some business.

1596
01:57:02,730 --> 01:57:03,890
I'm going after 'em.

1597
01:57:15,242 --> 01:57:17,107
Rafe! I got him!

1598
01:57:18,546 --> 01:57:20,810
P-40's!

1599
01:57:23,084 --> 01:57:24,449
They're pulling
into the clouds!

1600
01:57:24,485 --> 01:57:26,316
We ain't gonna let these
sons of bitches get home!

1601
01:57:33,661 --> 01:57:35,720
How do you like someone
shooting back at you?

1602
01:57:46,307 --> 01:57:47,740
I'm on your ass now!

1603
01:57:52,680 --> 01:57:54,409
Yeah! I got one!

1604
01:57:56,150 --> 01:57:57,640
Come on!

1605
01:58:09,563 --> 01:58:10,723
God, come on!

1606
01:58:19,507 --> 01:58:20,872
Come on, stay in there!

1607
01:58:33,888 --> 01:58:35,913
I got you, you son of a bitch!

1608
01:59:23,337 --> 01:59:25,464
Who taught you how to fly,
Lieutenant?

1609
01:59:27,408 --> 01:59:28,773
He did.

1610
01:59:35,316 --> 01:59:38,251
I have to amputate here!

1611
01:59:38,285 --> 01:59:39,684
You're not gonna die!

1612
01:59:39,720 --> 01:59:41,415
I got you.
Hold onto this...

1613
01:59:41,455 --> 01:59:43,013
Sandra,
we're running out of morphine.

1614
01:59:43,057 --> 01:59:45,525
Find some way to mark 'em...

1615
01:59:45,559 --> 01:59:49,518
so we can keep track
of who's got morphine already.

1616
01:59:49,563 --> 01:59:51,497
Tell me about your ship.
What ship are you from?

1617
01:59:51,532 --> 01:59:54,092
It's not marking.
Have you got a marker?

1618
01:59:58,405 --> 02:00:01,272
Use my lipstick!
Put "M" for morphine.

1619
02:00:01,308 --> 02:00:04,334
- We need a tourniquet!
- Tourniquet!

1620
02:00:05,846 --> 02:00:07,575
Where are the clamps?

1621
02:00:13,153 --> 02:00:14,814
There's nothing left!

1622
02:00:16,757 --> 02:00:18,691
Here, use this.

1623
02:00:18,726 --> 02:00:20,887
Go outside.
There's too many to help.

1624
02:00:20,928 --> 02:00:22,361
Sort them out.

1625
02:00:22,396 --> 02:00:24,660
Only those that can be saved
you bring in.

1626
02:00:24,698 --> 02:00:26,325
I can't...

1627
02:00:26,367 --> 02:00:28,232
No, please,
I need you to do it!

1628
02:00:28,269 --> 02:00:29,531
Go!

1629
02:00:57,031 --> 02:00:59,966
Don't look at anyone
without a mark!

1630
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:01,797
I told you, stand back!

1631
02:01:01,835 --> 02:01:03,359
Keep 'em outside!

1632
02:01:03,404 --> 02:01:05,838
Come on! Let's go!

1633
02:01:07,841 --> 02:01:09,502
Wait here.

1634
02:01:09,543 --> 02:01:12,512
Don't touch me, you Jap!
Get your hands off me!

1635
02:01:12,546 --> 02:01:14,377
Get him into critical.

1636
02:01:14,415 --> 02:01:17,748
- Get him off me.
- Critical, front ward!

1637
02:01:19,553 --> 02:01:21,885
How bad am I?

1638
02:01:21,922 --> 02:01:23,719
You're gonna be just fine,
sweetheart.

1639
02:01:23,757 --> 02:01:26,021
- I don't wanna die.
- You're not gonna die.

1640
02:01:26,060 --> 02:01:28,085
I've got your hand.

1641
02:01:28,128 --> 02:01:30,062
Give enough morphine
to make him comfortable.

1642
02:01:30,097 --> 02:01:31,223
He won't make it.

1643
02:01:31,265 --> 02:01:32,459
Line the critical up!

1644
02:01:32,499 --> 02:01:34,364
Get him morphine.
Take him over there!

1645
02:01:34,401 --> 02:01:36,198
Burn victims by the tree!

1646
02:01:36,236 --> 02:01:38,500
I just found her!

1647
02:01:38,539 --> 02:01:40,336
I don't think she's breathing.

1648
02:01:40,374 --> 02:01:42,239
No, she's dead. Take her...

1649
02:01:45,479 --> 02:01:48,414
Oh, God.

1650
02:01:48,449 --> 02:01:52,215
Are you sure, Ev?
Check her again.

1651
02:01:52,252 --> 02:01:54,686
She's dead.
Take her over there!

1652
02:01:54,722 --> 02:01:56,519
But you've gotta be sure!

1653
02:01:56,557 --> 02:01:59,082
She's dead!
Go back to work, Sandra.

1654
02:01:59,126 --> 02:02:02,892
I don't know what to do!

1655
02:03:34,555 --> 02:03:36,216
Over here!

1656
02:03:36,256 --> 02:03:37,382
Admiral?

1657
02:03:37,424 --> 02:03:39,722
From Washington.

1658
02:03:40,727 --> 02:03:43,423
"Attack by Japan
considered imminent."

1659
02:03:48,035 --> 02:03:50,333
They're only an hour late.

1660
02:04:47,995 --> 02:04:49,257
How can we help?

1661
02:04:49,296 --> 02:04:52,129
We need blood. Come on.

1662
02:04:54,968 --> 02:04:57,300
Remember, son,
hold on to your faith.

1663
02:04:57,337 --> 02:04:59,498
1,500 cartons over there.

1664
02:04:59,540 --> 02:05:01,633
"Today you will be
with me in paradise...

1665
02:05:01,675 --> 02:05:03,199
"so fear not."

1666
02:05:03,243 --> 02:05:05,302
Fear not, my son.

1667
02:05:05,345 --> 02:05:07,905
You are a man truly blessed.

1668
02:05:07,948 --> 02:05:10,678
You will die
in a state of grace.

1669
02:05:10,717 --> 02:05:14,619
Remember, pain is temporary,
but glory is forever.

1670
02:05:14,655 --> 02:05:16,714
Hold on to your faith, my son.

1671
02:05:16,757 --> 02:05:20,090
You'll be with God, the saints,
and the angels soon.

1672
02:05:20,127 --> 02:05:21,719
I absolve you of your sins...

1673
02:05:21,762 --> 02:05:25,755
in the name of the Father,
the Son, the Holy Spirit.

1674
02:05:28,402 --> 02:05:30,029
Amen.

1675
02:05:36,677 --> 02:05:38,668
Go with God, my son.

1676
02:05:45,385 --> 02:05:47,546
We've got men trapped
everywhere in the harbor.

1677
02:05:47,588 --> 02:05:49,419
We need help
from anybody who can move.

1678
02:05:57,464 --> 02:05:59,159
There's somebody in here!

1679
02:05:59,199 --> 02:06:01,030
Get somebody down here!

1680
02:06:03,403 --> 02:06:04,836
They're cutting through!

1681
02:06:10,377 --> 02:06:13,547
I hear somebody!
Get some guys up here!

1682
02:06:13,547 --> 02:06:15,572
Pull!

1683
02:06:18,318 --> 02:06:21,412
Get us out!
It's filling with water!

1684
02:06:21,455 --> 02:06:23,116
Get an airline in here!

1685
02:06:25,826 --> 02:06:28,727
We need the air hose!
What can we do?

1686
02:06:33,166 --> 02:06:35,566
It won't cut any faster!

1687
02:06:38,472 --> 02:06:41,873
Cut him out!

1688
02:07:14,074 --> 02:07:15,507
Yesterday...

1689
02:07:15,542 --> 02:07:19,911
December 7, 1941...

1690
02:07:21,114 --> 02:07:24,311
a date
which will live in infamy...

1691
02:07:24,351 --> 02:07:27,343
the United States of America...

1692
02:07:27,387 --> 02:07:30,550
was suddenly
and deliberately attacked...

1693
02:07:30,590 --> 02:07:35,254
by naval and air forces
of the empire of Japan.

1694
02:07:37,597 --> 02:07:38,859
It is obvious...

1695
02:07:38,899 --> 02:07:43,495
that planning the attack
began many weeks ago.

1696
02:07:43,537 --> 02:07:46,370
During the intervening time...

1697
02:07:46,406 --> 02:07:48,533
the Japanese government...

1698
02:07:48,575 --> 02:07:52,067
has deliberately sought
to deceive the United States...

1699
02:07:52,112 --> 02:07:54,239
by false statements...

1700
02:07:54,281 --> 02:07:58,945
and expressions of hope
for continued peace.

1701
02:07:58,985 --> 02:08:04,013
The attack yesterday
on the Hawaiian Islands...

1702
02:08:04,057 --> 02:08:09,188
has caused severe damage
to American military forces.

1703
02:08:09,229 --> 02:08:10,821
I regret to tell you...

1704
02:08:10,864 --> 02:08:16,234
that over 3,000 American lives
have been lost.

1705
02:08:16,269 --> 02:08:19,295
No matter how long
it may take us...

1706
02:08:19,339 --> 02:08:23,070
to overcome
this premeditated invasion...

1707
02:08:23,110 --> 02:08:27,342
the American people,
in their righteous might...

1708
02:08:27,381 --> 02:08:29,975
will win through
to absolute victory.

1709
02:08:34,121 --> 02:08:40,151
Because of this unprovoked,
dastardly attack by Japan...

1710
02:08:40,193 --> 02:08:44,095
I ask that the Congress
declare a state of war.

1711
02:08:50,070 --> 02:08:51,628
Is it true...

1712
02:08:51,671 --> 02:08:55,300
men are still trapped alive
inside the Arizona?

1713
02:08:57,210 --> 02:08:59,303
We can hear tapping
from inside the hull.

1714
02:08:59,346 --> 02:09:00,904
We're doing everything we can
to get to them...

1715
02:09:00,947 --> 02:09:02,812
but they're
forty feet below water.

1716
02:09:09,389 --> 02:09:11,823
We've been trained to think
that we're invincible.

1717
02:09:11,858 --> 02:09:15,919
And now our proudest ships
have been destroyed...

1718
02:09:15,962 --> 02:09:19,955
by an enemy
we considered inferior.

1719
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,230
We're on the ropes, gentlemen.

1720
02:09:22,269 --> 02:09:26,228
That's exactly why
we have to strike back now.

1721
02:09:26,273 --> 02:09:29,106
We'll attack the Marshall
and Gilbert Islands, sir.

1722
02:09:29,142 --> 02:09:33,010
I mean hitting the heart of
Japan the way they have hit us.

1723
02:09:34,748 --> 02:09:36,841
Mr. President...

1724
02:09:36,883 --> 02:09:40,375
Pearl Harbor caught us unawares
because we didn't face facts.

1725
02:09:40,420 --> 02:09:43,412
This isn't a time
for ignoring them again.

1726
02:09:43,457 --> 02:09:46,893
We have long-range bombers,
but no place to launch them.

1727
02:09:46,927 --> 02:09:50,829
Midway is too far,
and Russia won't allow us...

1728
02:09:50,864 --> 02:09:52,195
to launch a raid from there.

1729
02:09:53,433 --> 02:09:54,559
Admiral?

1730
02:09:54,601 --> 02:09:56,034
Navy's planes are small.

1731
02:09:56,069 --> 02:09:57,934
They carry light loads
and have a short range.

1732
02:09:57,971 --> 02:10:01,304
We'd have to get them within
a few hundred miles of Japan.

1733
02:10:01,341 --> 02:10:04,469
We'd risk our carriers,
and if we lose them...

1734
02:10:04,511 --> 02:10:06,206
we'll have no shield
against invasion.

1735
02:10:06,246 --> 02:10:09,238
Does anyone in this room
think victory is possible...

1736
02:10:09,282 --> 02:10:10,909
without facing danger?

1737
02:10:10,951 --> 02:10:13,977
We are at war.
Of course there's a risk.

1738
02:10:14,020 --> 02:10:16,250
But consider the risk,
Mr. President.

1739
02:10:16,289 --> 02:10:19,122
If the Japanese
invade us right now...

1740
02:10:19,159 --> 02:10:22,151
they would reach Chicago
before we could stop them.

1741
02:10:24,431 --> 02:10:26,422
Gentlemen...

1742
02:10:28,101 --> 02:10:33,061
most of you did not know me
when I had the use of my legs.

1743
02:10:33,106 --> 02:10:36,837
I was strong and proud...
and arrogant.

1744
02:10:36,877 --> 02:10:40,643
Now I wonder,
every hour of my life...

1745
02:10:40,680 --> 02:10:44,582
why God put me into this chair.

1746
02:10:44,618 --> 02:10:48,019
But when I see defeat
in the eyes of my countrymen...

1747
02:10:48,054 --> 02:10:50,522
in your eyes, right now...

1748
02:10:50,557 --> 02:10:53,583
I start to think that
maybe he brought me down...

1749
02:10:53,627 --> 02:10:54,958
for times like these...

1750
02:10:54,995 --> 02:10:57,725
when we all need to be reminded
who we truly are...

1751
02:10:57,764 --> 02:11:00,961
that we will not
give up or give in.

1752
02:11:01,001 --> 02:11:02,434
Mr. President,
with all respect, sir...

1753
02:11:02,469 --> 02:11:04,437
what you're asking
can't be done.

1754
02:11:20,620 --> 02:11:22,952
- Mr. President!
- Get back, George!

1755
02:11:36,436 --> 02:11:38,996
Do not tell me...

1756
02:11:39,039 --> 02:11:41,166
it can't be done.

1757
02:11:45,845 --> 02:11:48,837
Japan continues
its military conquest...

1758
02:11:48,882 --> 02:11:50,076
throughout the Pacific.

1759
02:11:51,751 --> 02:11:53,241
But, back home...

1760
02:11:53,286 --> 02:11:55,720
millions of American workers
band together...

1761
02:11:55,755 --> 02:11:58,690
bringing factories to life
to avenge Pearl Harbor.

1762
02:12:03,163 --> 02:12:05,961
Mr. President, we have an idea
how to bomb the Japanese.

1763
02:12:05,999 --> 02:12:08,763
Sir, it's risky...

1764
02:12:08,802 --> 02:12:10,292
but it's bold.

1765
02:12:11,938 --> 02:12:14,406
- Who are you?
- I, sir?

1766
02:12:14,441 --> 02:12:16,068
Captain Low, Mr. President.

1767
02:12:17,444 --> 02:12:19,708
He's a submariner.
He came up with this idea.

1768
02:12:19,746 --> 02:12:22,180
I like sub commanders.

1769
02:12:22,215 --> 02:12:26,379
They don't have time
for bullshit, and neither do I.

1770
02:12:26,419 --> 02:12:28,114
Fire away, gentlemen.

1771
02:12:44,604 --> 02:12:46,504
And where is God in all this?

1772
02:12:48,308 --> 02:12:53,109
Our enemies believe
a divine wind protects them.

1773
02:12:53,146 --> 02:12:56,946
But we see our friends
laid out here before us.

1774
02:13:18,872 --> 02:13:20,032
Hey, Captain.

1775
02:13:43,763 --> 02:13:45,390
Lieutenants Rafe McCawley,
Daniel Walker.

1776
02:13:45,432 --> 02:13:46,899
Yes, Major?

1777
02:13:46,933 --> 02:13:50,334
You're both going stateside.
Fly out in two hours.

1778
02:13:50,370 --> 02:13:51,701
What for, sir?

1779
02:13:51,738 --> 02:13:53,399
Ask Colonel Doolittle.

1780
02:13:56,976 --> 02:13:58,375
Yes, sir.

1781
02:14:14,094 --> 02:14:15,391
You're packing.

1782
02:14:18,598 --> 02:14:19,860
Orders.

1783
02:14:19,899 --> 02:14:22,629
What kind of orders?

1784
02:14:22,669 --> 02:14:26,264
The top-secret kind.

1785
02:14:26,306 --> 02:14:28,433
The dangerous kind.

1786
02:14:30,343 --> 02:14:32,072
I can't find Danny.

1787
02:14:32,112 --> 02:14:34,376
Is that why you're here?

1788
02:14:34,414 --> 02:14:35,847
Looking for Danny?

1789
02:14:37,183 --> 02:14:38,480
Probably saying good-bye
to his squadron.

1790
02:14:38,518 --> 02:14:39,678
We've been assigned
to Doolittle.

1791
02:14:49,562 --> 02:14:51,257
I wasn't looking for Danny.

1792
02:14:56,469 --> 02:14:58,027
I couldn't have you go away...

1793
02:14:58,071 --> 02:14:59,971
without you
understanding something.

1794
02:15:05,545 --> 02:15:07,706
Yeah. You don't have
to explain anything.

1795
02:15:07,747 --> 02:15:12,116
I do, because you're acting
like I didn't love you.

1796
02:15:12,152 --> 02:15:15,349
Evelyn,
loving you kept me alive.

1797
02:15:26,266 --> 02:15:27,824
I should've died over there.

1798
02:15:27,867 --> 02:15:32,429
When I was in that water,
I made a deal with God.

1799
02:15:34,073 --> 02:15:35,802
I told him I was sorry...

1800
02:15:35,842 --> 02:15:38,640
that I knew I'd been a fool
for leaving you...

1801
02:15:38,678 --> 02:15:40,873
trying to go over there
and be a hero...

1802
02:15:42,215 --> 02:15:44,342
and I promised I'd never ask
for anything again...

1803
02:15:45,518 --> 02:15:48,487
if I could just see you
one more time.

1804
02:15:51,958 --> 02:15:53,220
And you know what?

1805
02:15:55,328 --> 02:15:56,659
It was worth it.

1806
02:15:58,598 --> 02:16:02,034
You kept me alive, Evelyn.
You brought me home.

1807
02:16:03,169 --> 02:16:05,501
So I'm gonna stand by
my end of the deal.

1808
02:16:05,538 --> 02:16:07,301
I'm gonna walk away.

1809
02:16:07,340 --> 02:16:10,639
And I won't ask you
for anything.

1810
02:16:10,677 --> 02:16:12,474
But I just want to know why.

1811
02:16:12,512 --> 02:16:15,447
Just tell me that, will you,
please? Just tell me why.

1812
02:16:17,016 --> 02:16:19,177
Rafe, I'm pregnant.

1813
02:16:28,261 --> 02:16:30,058
Oh, my God.

1814
02:16:33,366 --> 02:16:36,733
I didn't even know until
the day you turned up alive.

1815
02:16:38,271 --> 02:16:40,739
And then all this happened.

1816
02:16:42,508 --> 02:16:43,770
I haven't told Danny.

1817
02:16:45,411 --> 02:16:47,572
I don't want him to know.

1818
02:16:47,614 --> 02:16:49,514
All he needs to think about...

1819
02:16:49,549 --> 02:16:52,347
is how to do this mission
and get back alive.

1820
02:16:55,121 --> 02:16:58,488
Rafe, all I ever wanted...

1821
02:16:58,524 --> 02:17:01,721
was for us to have a home,
grow old together...

1822
02:17:01,761 --> 02:17:04,753
but life never asked me
what I wanted.

1823
02:17:04,797 --> 02:17:07,960
Now, I'm gonna give Danny
my whole heart...

1824
02:17:09,936 --> 02:17:12,268
but I don't think I'll ever
look at another sunset...

1825
02:17:12,305 --> 02:17:14,034
without thinking of you.

1826
02:17:18,111 --> 02:17:19,908
I'll love you my whole life.

1827
02:17:57,850 --> 02:17:59,715
I'll see you on board.

1828
02:18:17,236 --> 02:18:21,332
You know, the only thing
that scares me...

1829
02:18:21,374 --> 02:18:24,104
is that you might love him
more than you love me.

1830
02:18:26,713 --> 02:18:28,305
I love you, Danny.

1831
02:18:31,384 --> 02:18:34,251
And I'll be here waiting
for you when you come back.

1832
02:18:52,372 --> 02:18:53,566
Follow me.

1833
02:18:57,276 --> 02:18:58,743
Colonel.

1834
02:19:02,915 --> 02:19:04,746
Congratulations
on your promotion, sir.

1835
02:19:04,784 --> 02:19:06,183
I heard what you did.

1836
02:19:06,219 --> 02:19:08,187
We can explain that, sir.

1837
02:19:08,221 --> 02:19:10,052
Explain what?

1838
02:19:10,089 --> 02:19:12,887
Whatever it is
you heard about us, sir.

1839
02:19:12,925 --> 02:19:14,586
You mean the hula shirts
you were flying in?

1840
02:19:19,899 --> 02:19:22,231
Or the seven planes
you shot down?

1841
02:19:25,338 --> 02:19:28,899
You're both being awarded
the Silver Star...

1842
02:19:28,941 --> 02:19:30,841
and promoted to captain.

1843
02:19:32,311 --> 02:19:34,711
Is that the good news,
sir, or...

1844
02:19:34,747 --> 02:19:36,476
You're just about
the only pilots in the Army...

1845
02:19:36,516 --> 02:19:38,882
with combat experience.

1846
02:19:38,918 --> 02:19:40,545
I need you for a mission...

1847
02:19:40,586 --> 02:19:42,781
I've been ordered
to put together.

1848
02:19:44,290 --> 02:19:46,053
You know what top secret is?

1849
02:19:46,092 --> 02:19:47,423
Yes, sir.

1850
02:19:47,460 --> 02:19:50,122
It's the kind of mission
where you get medals.

1851
02:19:50,163 --> 02:19:52,427
But they send 'em
to your relatives.

1852
02:19:52,465 --> 02:19:54,626
Top secret means
you train for something...

1853
02:19:54,667 --> 02:19:57,135
never done before
in aviation history...

1854
02:19:57,170 --> 02:19:59,297
and you go without knowing
where you're going.

1855
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:04,371
You do it on that basis
or not at all.

1856
02:20:04,410 --> 02:20:05,741
I'll go, sir.

1857
02:20:06,679 --> 02:20:08,613
I'll go, too, sir.

1858
02:20:10,750 --> 02:20:13,981
By the way, the Brits sent
over your personal effects.

1859
02:20:14,020 --> 02:20:15,214
Thank you, sir.

1860
02:20:15,254 --> 02:20:16,653
There's only one more thing.

1861
02:20:16,689 --> 02:20:20,352
Leave your goddamn hula shirts
at home.

1862
02:20:23,597 --> 02:20:24,825
Dear Rafe.

1863
02:20:24,864 --> 02:20:27,298
It's so strange
to be this far from you...

1864
02:20:27,334 --> 02:20:31,464
but you should know this...
every night...

1865
02:20:40,780 --> 02:20:42,941
I've been looking
all over for you.

1866
02:20:44,317 --> 02:20:46,114
Danny...

1867
02:20:47,420 --> 02:20:49,615
This ain't no time
to leave things unsaid.

1868
02:20:50,957 --> 02:20:52,925
Now, we gotta face facts here.

1869
02:20:52,959 --> 02:20:56,224
The fact is, we just both love
the same woman.

1870
02:21:03,803 --> 02:21:06,863
She's the first girl I ever
felt this way about, Rafe.

1871
02:21:09,376 --> 02:21:12,777
I couldn't help what happened
any more than you could.

1872
02:21:16,883 --> 02:21:19,249
This is different,
though, Danny.

1873
02:21:19,285 --> 02:21:21,048
Evelyn already lost
the man she loved once.

1874
02:21:21,087 --> 02:21:23,078
I just don't want it to see
that happen to her again.

1875
02:21:23,123 --> 02:21:26,286
Guys like us got no choice.
This is war.

1876
02:21:26,326 --> 02:21:27,884
She knows that.

1877
02:21:27,927 --> 02:21:30,487
Danny, don't do this.

1878
02:21:30,530 --> 02:21:31,895
Don't go on this mission.

1879
02:21:33,199 --> 02:21:35,030
You got nothing to prove.

1880
02:21:36,369 --> 02:21:38,667
You've been protecting me
since we were kids.

1881
02:21:42,075 --> 02:21:44,043
You do tend to need it
from time to time.

1882
02:22:03,596 --> 02:22:05,655
The mission I'm asking you
to volunteer for...

1883
02:22:05,699 --> 02:22:07,291
is exceptionally dangerous.

1884
02:22:08,234 --> 02:22:10,794
Take a look at the man
beside you.

1885
02:22:10,837 --> 02:22:13,397
It's a good bet
that in the next six weeks...

1886
02:22:13,440 --> 02:22:16,637
you or he...

1887
02:22:16,676 --> 02:22:17,904
will be dead.

1888
02:22:21,081 --> 02:22:23,606
Everyone brave enough
to accept this...

1889
02:22:24,951 --> 02:22:26,714
step forward.

1890
02:22:34,761 --> 02:22:36,661
Your grandmother
could take a B-25 off...

1891
02:22:36,696 --> 02:22:39,164
on a mile-long runway.

1892
02:22:39,199 --> 02:22:44,068
I'm gonna train you
to do it in 467 feet.

1893
02:22:44,104 --> 02:22:47,665
Because at 468 feet...

1894
02:22:47,707 --> 02:22:49,732
you're dead.

1895
02:22:49,776 --> 02:22:50,902
And once you get it up...

1896
02:22:50,944 --> 02:22:53,742
you'll learn to fly it
like a fighter...

1897
02:22:53,780 --> 02:22:55,941
thirty feet off the ground.

1898
02:22:55,982 --> 02:22:57,313
I want you to say hello...

1899
02:22:57,350 --> 02:22:59,716
to Lieutenant Jack Richards,
Navy Aviation.

1900
02:22:59,753 --> 02:23:01,983
He'll help us
lighten these fat ladies.

1901
02:23:02,088 --> 02:23:04,147
Dump that ashcan.

1902
02:23:04,224 --> 02:23:06,590
See that bomb sight?
Get rid of it.

1903
02:23:06,626 --> 02:23:08,253
Colonel, he's crazy!

1904
02:23:08,294 --> 02:23:10,353
- The lady's fat!
- Listen to him.

1905
02:23:10,396 --> 02:23:12,296
She's fat.
We want a skinny lady!

1906
02:23:17,470 --> 02:23:19,097
Max power!

1907
02:23:21,975 --> 02:23:23,306
Get up!

1908
02:23:24,110 --> 02:23:25,600
How the heck...

1909
02:23:25,645 --> 02:23:27,044
Damn!

1910
02:23:34,821 --> 02:23:36,584
They just keep
rolling past that line.

1911
02:23:36,623 --> 02:23:38,113
Maybe it's a bad idea.

1912
02:23:38,158 --> 02:23:40,820
No, they're too heavy.
We gotta get drastic.

1913
02:23:40,860 --> 02:23:42,487
This armored plating goes.

1914
02:23:42,529 --> 02:23:45,362
I'm sure.
Lose it like a skirt, son.

1915
02:23:45,398 --> 02:23:46,888
Release brakes!

1916
02:23:49,035 --> 02:23:50,468
Come on!

1917
02:23:52,372 --> 02:23:56,274
- God!
- Put every man on the line!

1918
02:23:58,878 --> 02:24:01,039
Let's show these boys
how this thing is done!

1919
02:24:03,082 --> 02:24:05,016
Come on! Max power.

1920
02:24:10,056 --> 02:24:12,217
Well, if he can do it...

1921
02:24:29,342 --> 02:24:31,367
Gentlemen, now I can tell you...

1922
02:24:31,411 --> 02:24:33,242
that we're going to Tokyo.

1923
02:24:35,014 --> 02:24:36,641
And we're gonna bomb it.

1924
02:24:42,622 --> 02:24:44,419
That comes
as a special request...

1925
02:24:44,457 --> 02:24:46,789
directly from
President Roosevelt.

1926
02:24:46,826 --> 02:24:50,262
The Navy'll sneak us about
400 miles off the coast...

1927
02:24:50,296 --> 02:24:51,695
and we'll launch
from the carrier there.

1928
02:24:51,731 --> 02:24:53,221
Has that been done before?

1929
02:24:54,400 --> 02:24:55,867
Taking Army bombers
off Navy carriers?

1930
02:24:55,902 --> 02:24:59,099
- No.
- OK.

1931
02:24:59,138 --> 02:25:00,901
Any other questions?

1932
02:25:00,940 --> 02:25:02,965
Well, sir, is it even
possible to land...

1933
02:25:03,009 --> 02:25:05,239
a B-25
on an aircraft carrier deck?

1934
02:25:05,278 --> 02:25:07,109
That won't matter.

1935
02:25:07,146 --> 02:25:10,479
As soon as we're airborne,
the carrier heads for Hawaii.

1936
02:25:10,516 --> 02:25:12,746
But without them,
where do we land?

1937
02:25:12,785 --> 02:25:15,618
I have a phrase
I want you to memorize.

1938
02:25:20,293 --> 02:25:22,557
It means "I am an American".

1939
02:25:24,097 --> 02:25:26,065
In Chinese.

1940
02:25:27,166 --> 02:25:28,758
Ain't gonna be any easier.

1941
02:25:28,801 --> 02:25:31,463
That's three feet shorter
than our practice runway.

1942
02:25:31,504 --> 02:25:33,096
- Fellas?
- Sir.

1943
02:25:37,644 --> 02:25:39,407
Secretary of the Navy
gave me these.

1944
02:25:40,914 --> 02:25:42,245
What are they?

1945
02:25:42,282 --> 02:25:44,147
Friendship medals
the Japanese gave us...

1946
02:25:44,183 --> 02:25:45,844
when they were pretending
to want peace.

1947
02:25:45,885 --> 02:25:47,284
What'll you do with them?

1948
02:25:47,320 --> 02:25:49,914
Wire them to the bombs
and give them back.

1949
02:25:53,159 --> 02:25:55,286
So what's going on?

1950
02:25:55,328 --> 02:25:57,353
Well, sir,
we only have sixteen planes.

1951
02:25:57,397 --> 02:25:58,659
So?

1952
02:25:58,698 --> 02:26:02,031
When the Japs hit us,
they had more than 300.

1953
02:26:02,068 --> 02:26:04,229
How much difference
can we make?

1954
02:26:04,270 --> 02:26:06,135
It's not that we're afraid,
sir.

1955
02:26:06,172 --> 02:26:09,630
But we might die, and
we want to know what it's for.

1956
02:26:12,779 --> 02:26:15,612
You know, at Pearl,
they hit us with a sledgehammer.

1957
02:26:17,483 --> 02:26:20,748
This raid,
even if we make it through...

1958
02:26:20,787 --> 02:26:24,086
it'll only be a pinprick...

1959
02:26:24,123 --> 02:26:25,988
but it'll be straight
through their hearts.

1960
02:26:27,360 --> 02:26:30,852
Victory belongs to those
that believe in it the most...

1961
02:26:30,897 --> 02:26:32,455
and believe in it the longest.

1962
02:26:34,100 --> 02:26:36,660
We're gonna believe.

1963
02:26:36,703 --> 02:26:38,898
We're gonna make
America believe, too.

1964
02:26:38,938 --> 02:26:41,065
Colonel? I need a minute.

1965
02:26:43,543 --> 02:26:46,376
- Excuse me, Major Jackson?
- Yes?

1966
02:26:46,412 --> 02:26:47,572
Do you remember me?

1967
02:26:48,848 --> 02:26:50,611
Sure I do.

1968
02:26:50,650 --> 02:26:53,050
I'm sorry.
I've been meaning to thank you.

1969
02:26:53,086 --> 02:26:54,713
Maybe you can.

1970
02:26:54,754 --> 02:26:57,882
When the news comes in
about the Doolittle boys...

1971
02:26:57,924 --> 02:26:59,721
I want to be
in the command post.

1972
02:27:00,727 --> 02:27:03,218
I'm sorry. I don't know
what you're talking about.

1973
02:27:05,765 --> 02:27:07,824
How the hell
do you know about this mission?

1974
02:27:09,035 --> 02:27:11,003
Let's call it
an inadvertent disclosure.

1975
02:27:11,037 --> 02:27:13,403
Some flyboy you're dating
shot his mouth off.

1976
02:27:14,741 --> 02:27:16,709
Actually,
it's about two pilots.

1977
02:27:16,743 --> 02:27:19,940
I know they're going
into great danger.

1978
02:27:19,979 --> 02:27:22,243
I just want to be there
when the news tells us...

1979
02:27:22,281 --> 02:27:23,543
if they've lived or died.

1980
02:27:27,754 --> 02:27:30,245
Most officers would have
thrown you in the brig.

1981
02:27:30,289 --> 02:27:32,985
Most nurses
wouldn't keep their fingers...

1982
02:27:33,026 --> 02:27:34,459
plugged in your artery.

1983
02:27:40,166 --> 02:27:41,895
I can't promise you anything.

1984
02:27:48,608 --> 02:27:51,338
Hey, Red,
you think they picked us...

1985
02:27:51,377 --> 02:27:54,073
to do this
'cause we're young and dumb?

1986
02:27:55,314 --> 02:27:57,942
Come on, Gooz,
we're the tip of the sword.

1987
02:28:15,001 --> 02:28:16,628
In honor of our trip to Japan...

1988
02:28:16,669 --> 02:28:19,763
I got us some victory cigars!

1989
02:28:19,806 --> 02:28:22,604
There you go.

1990
02:28:22,642 --> 02:28:24,906
Put that in your inside pocket,
next to your heart.

1991
02:28:24,944 --> 02:28:26,741
You know, Jack,
we may lose this battle...

1992
02:28:26,779 --> 02:28:29,441
but we're gonna win this war.

1993
02:28:29,482 --> 02:28:31,882
- You know how I know?
- No.

1994
02:28:33,853 --> 02:28:35,013
Them.

1995
02:28:36,155 --> 02:28:37,622
'Cause they're rare.

1996
02:28:38,925 --> 02:28:41,359
And at times like these,
you see them...

1997
02:28:43,196 --> 02:28:44,493
stepping forward.

1998
02:28:46,332 --> 02:28:49,563
There's nothing stronger than
the heart of a volunteer, Jack.

1999
02:28:55,208 --> 02:28:56,402
My friends
in the war department...

2000
02:28:56,442 --> 02:28:58,842
don't want me
to lead this raid...

2001
02:28:58,878 --> 02:29:02,143
because they say
I'm too valuable.

2002
02:29:02,181 --> 02:29:03,580
They don't want me
up in the air...

2003
02:29:03,616 --> 02:29:06,210
flying with the men
that I've chosen...

2004
02:29:06,252 --> 02:29:09,744
that I've chewed out, cussed
out, pushed to the limit...

2005
02:29:12,358 --> 02:29:14,690
and that I've come to respect.

2006
02:29:16,929 --> 02:29:18,863
They want me to stand
on the flight deck...

2007
02:29:18,898 --> 02:29:21,366
and wave you off.
I don't see it that way.

2008
02:29:23,536 --> 02:29:24,696
So I'm going with you.

2009
02:29:29,909 --> 02:29:31,536
We take off
tomorrow afternoon...

2010
02:29:31,577 --> 02:29:33,841
drop our fire,
and head for China.

2011
02:29:33,880 --> 02:29:36,348
Our mission
is to hit military targets...

2012
02:29:36,382 --> 02:29:38,350
aircraft and tank factories.

2013
02:29:38,384 --> 02:29:41,182
Colonel, you've given us
homing beacons...

2014
02:29:41,220 --> 02:29:44,246
but you said China is
overrun with Japanese troops.

2015
02:29:44,290 --> 02:29:46,315
What if the beacons
are switched off?

2016
02:29:46,359 --> 02:29:47,986
Bring her down
any way you can...

2017
02:29:48,027 --> 02:29:49,517
and do your best
to avoid capture.

2018
02:29:49,562 --> 02:29:52,588
What if we have to bail out
over Japan?

2019
02:29:52,632 --> 02:29:57,069
Well, in that situation,
I can't tell you what to do.

2020
02:29:57,103 --> 02:29:59,037
What would you do, Colonel?

2021
02:30:02,041 --> 02:30:03,975
I wasn't built
to be a prisoner...

2022
02:30:06,012 --> 02:30:08,879
so I would have
my crew bail out.

2023
02:30:08,915 --> 02:30:11,611
I'd find the sweetest
military target I could...

2024
02:30:11,651 --> 02:30:14,381
and drive my plane right
smack into the middle of it.

2025
02:30:14,381 --> 02:30:16,958
and kill many of those busters i possibly could.

2026
02:30:21,558 --> 02:30:23,219
But that's just me.

2027
02:30:26,162 --> 02:30:28,460
I'm forty-five years old.
I'm an old man.

2028
02:30:28,498 --> 02:30:30,193
You guys have your whole lives
ahead of you...

2029
02:30:31,801 --> 02:30:33,530
so what you do is up to you.

2030
02:30:41,177 --> 02:30:44,305
The mission will launch
in a couple of hours.

2031
02:30:44,347 --> 02:30:45,939
You'll stay right in here.

2032
02:30:49,920 --> 02:30:51,251
Stay here.

2033
02:30:51,288 --> 02:30:53,483
Don't talk to them.
They won't talk to you.

2034
02:30:53,523 --> 02:30:55,013
Pretend to type
the information we pass you.

2035
02:30:55,058 --> 02:30:56,218
That's it.

2036
02:30:58,161 --> 02:31:02,097
This is Orphan Annie
from Radio Tokyo.

2037
02:31:02,132 --> 02:31:04,794
To all the lonely boys
in the South Pacific...

2038
02:31:04,834 --> 02:31:07,132
watch out...
the enemy will get you.

2039
02:31:07,170 --> 02:31:08,364
Maybe she's right.

2040
02:31:12,876 --> 02:31:15,504
Japs transmitting!

2041
02:31:16,813 --> 02:31:19,304
Captain, radar reports
Japanese patrol boats.

2042
02:31:19,349 --> 02:31:21,146
- Range 400 yards.
- How many yards?

2043
02:31:21,184 --> 02:31:22,742
400 yards and closing, sir.

2044
02:31:22,786 --> 02:31:25,778
Richards, Japs!
400 yards! Let's go!

2045
02:31:25,822 --> 02:31:28,620
Admiral Halsey's ordering
the cruisers to open fire!

2046
02:31:28,658 --> 02:31:31,650
We gotta sink these Jap boats
before they give us away.

2047
02:31:31,695 --> 02:31:32,957
Go to general quarters!

2048
02:31:32,996 --> 02:31:35,362
Go!

2049
02:31:35,398 --> 02:31:37,866
Oh, my God.

2050
02:31:37,901 --> 02:31:40,563
This can't be good!

2051
02:31:40,603 --> 02:31:42,935
All hands,
man your battle stations.

2052
02:31:46,843 --> 02:31:49,971
Japs one mile away.
They reported our position.

2053
02:31:50,013 --> 02:31:52,982
Supposed to launch
400 miles away. How far are we?

2054
02:31:53,016 --> 02:31:54,608
624 miles.

2055
02:31:54,651 --> 02:31:56,846
- Jesus!
- What do you want to do?

2056
02:32:01,491 --> 02:32:04,051
Colonel, I don't know
if the planes...

2057
02:32:04,094 --> 02:32:05,891
can carry enough fuel
to make it to China.

2058
02:32:06,763 --> 02:32:08,958
Now. We launch now!

2059
02:32:10,567 --> 02:32:12,694
Army pilots! Man your planes!

2060
02:32:17,407 --> 02:32:19,568
They're shooting at something.

2061
02:32:19,609 --> 02:32:21,804
- Let's go!
- It ain't a drill!

2062
02:32:33,289 --> 02:32:35,689
Colonel!
We're too far out to make it!

2063
02:32:35,725 --> 02:32:38,717
They need more fuel,
but they can't get too heavy!

2064
02:32:38,762 --> 02:32:42,528
Strip everything out of
this plane you don't need now!

2065
02:32:44,768 --> 02:32:46,360
Start pre-flight! Let's go!

2066
02:32:46,403 --> 02:32:49,099
Add ten cans of fuel
for each plane!

2067
02:32:49,139 --> 02:32:51,004
Every plane!

2068
02:32:54,244 --> 02:32:56,109
Let's go! Move!

2069
02:32:56,146 --> 02:32:57,511
Guys, get up there!

2070
02:32:57,547 --> 02:32:59,538
Lose those suitcases now!

2071
02:32:59,582 --> 02:33:01,277
- What's your favorite gun?
- What?

2072
02:33:01,317 --> 02:33:04,650
You want off this deck,
give me a gun now!

2073
02:33:04,687 --> 02:33:05,847
It's still too heavy!

2074
02:33:07,157 --> 02:33:10,558
Go to the kitchen,
get some broomsticks.

2075
02:33:10,593 --> 02:33:12,288
Cut 'em down, paint 'em black,
and bring them here.

2076
02:33:12,328 --> 02:33:15,456
We'll put a broomstick
where this gun was.

2077
02:33:15,498 --> 02:33:17,227
What are you doing to my plane?

2078
02:33:17,267 --> 02:33:20,134
Tell your crew to take a piss
before they take off.

2079
02:33:23,306 --> 02:33:25,297
We got broomsticks
for tail guns.

2080
02:33:25,341 --> 02:33:28,799
Yeah.
Maybe it'll scare 'em.

2081
02:33:28,845 --> 02:33:30,836
You take care of yourself
up there.

2082
02:33:30,880 --> 02:33:32,040
Yeah, I will.

2083
02:33:32,082 --> 02:33:35,108
Danny, be careful, you hear me?

2084
02:33:35,151 --> 02:33:37,381
I will.
I'll see you, Rafe.

2085
02:33:37,420 --> 02:33:39,547
Rafe!
We're the tip of the sword!

2086
02:33:45,695 --> 02:33:48,664
- Turning on one!
- Turning on two!

2087
02:33:53,136 --> 02:33:54,603
All right.

2088
02:33:54,637 --> 02:33:56,434
You ready for this?

2089
02:33:59,042 --> 02:34:01,977
Superchargers low and latched!

2090
02:34:02,011 --> 02:34:03,740
We're full into the wind!

2091
02:34:03,780 --> 02:34:05,941
More speed!

2092
02:34:16,960 --> 02:34:18,427
Are you nervous?

2093
02:34:18,461 --> 02:34:19,860
No... yes, sir. Yes.

2094
02:34:19,896 --> 02:34:21,523
When did you find religion?

2095
02:34:21,564 --> 02:34:23,691
When you assigned me
to this mission, sir.

2096
02:34:23,733 --> 02:34:25,394
Do me a favor.

2097
02:34:25,435 --> 02:34:27,869
- What's that, Colonel?
- Pray for both of us.

2098
02:34:27,904 --> 02:34:29,064
Tell me when!

2099
02:34:29,105 --> 02:34:30,538
Let's go!

2100
02:34:39,282 --> 02:34:40,874
Max power!

2101
02:34:43,987 --> 02:34:45,545
Oh, please.

2102
02:34:46,689 --> 02:34:49,157
Come on!

2103
02:34:59,636 --> 02:35:00,967
Way to go!

2104
02:35:02,705 --> 02:35:05,230
Jesus, that was short.

2105
02:35:07,043 --> 02:35:09,238
Move 'em up!

2106
02:35:09,279 --> 02:35:12,180
Full power, here we go!

2107
02:35:13,616 --> 02:35:15,174
Pull back!

2108
02:35:26,429 --> 02:35:28,522
Come on, here we go!

2109
02:35:40,210 --> 02:35:41,609
We made it!

2110
02:35:59,729 --> 02:36:01,663
From Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo...

2111
02:36:02,565 --> 02:36:04,260
we have been described...

2112
02:36:04,334 --> 02:36:07,326
as a nation of weaklings
and playboys...

2113
02:36:07,370 --> 02:36:11,067
who hire British,
Russian, or Chinese soldiers...

2114
02:36:11,107 --> 02:36:13,632
to do our fighting for us.

2115
02:36:13,676 --> 02:36:16,474
Let them repeat that now.

2116
02:36:16,512 --> 02:36:20,141
Let them tell that to
General MacArthur and his men.

2117
02:36:20,183 --> 02:36:23,914
Let them tell that
to the soldiers who today...

2118
02:36:23,953 --> 02:36:27,787
are fighting hard in
the far waters of the Pacific.

2119
02:36:27,824 --> 02:36:31,988
Let them tell that to the boys
in the flying fortresses.

2120
02:36:32,028 --> 02:36:34,963
Let them tell that
to the Marines.

2121
02:36:36,399 --> 02:36:39,857
That's Japan, fellas.
Tighten up back there!

2122
02:36:39,902 --> 02:36:42,336
Man your guns!

2123
02:36:42,372 --> 02:36:43,771
We're in the enemy's backyard!

2124
02:36:45,842 --> 02:36:48,276
Look alive back there.
I see coastline.

2125
02:36:55,251 --> 02:36:56,980
Heads up, boys!

2126
02:37:01,824 --> 02:37:03,689
Man your guns back there.

2127
02:37:03,726 --> 02:37:05,785
I'm cocked and locked!

2128
02:37:05,828 --> 02:37:07,295
Get ready, suckers!

2129
02:37:15,338 --> 02:37:16,965
Approaching targets
for bombing raid!

2130
02:37:17,006 --> 02:37:19,873
Open bomb bay doors.

2131
02:37:19,909 --> 02:37:22,207
Ripley,
you got a target in sight?

2132
02:37:23,613 --> 02:37:25,478
37 degrees!
Target in sight!

2133
02:37:34,590 --> 02:37:36,990
All right, boys,
let's knock their clocks off!

2134
02:37:37,026 --> 02:37:39,017
- Drop your ordnance!
- Bombs away!

2135
02:37:39,062 --> 02:37:40,996
One away!

2136
02:37:41,030 --> 02:37:43,225
Bombs away!

2137
02:37:43,266 --> 02:37:44,995
Two away!

2138
02:37:53,910 --> 02:37:55,571
Three away!
Four away!

2139
02:37:59,849 --> 02:38:02,079
We caught 'em by surprise!

2140
02:38:02,118 --> 02:38:05,019
- Dropping ordnance!
- Bombs away!

2141
02:38:12,695 --> 02:38:14,526
We got it!

2142
02:38:14,564 --> 02:38:16,657
We hit our targets!
Good job, raiders!

2143
02:38:29,479 --> 02:38:33,279
God! Jesus! Shit!

2144
02:38:34,650 --> 02:38:36,550
We got flak everywhere!

2145
02:38:38,688 --> 02:38:40,121
Go down there and get Gooz!

2146
02:38:40,156 --> 02:38:42,056
I want everyone to separate!

2147
02:38:42,091 --> 02:38:43,991
- Clean that up!
- Yes, sir.

2148
02:38:44,026 --> 02:38:45,391
Try and clean that up!

2149
02:38:45,428 --> 02:38:46,588
They're shooting flak at us!

2150
02:38:58,107 --> 02:39:00,575
We gotta get out of this shit,
Gooz!

2151
02:39:03,413 --> 02:39:07,372
- We got a fire!
- Tail's hit!

2152
02:39:07,417 --> 02:39:10,215
The electrics!
We got a fire back here!

2153
02:39:10,253 --> 02:39:12,721
I gotta short this out!

2154
02:39:12,755 --> 02:39:15,417
Get into the clouds,
Danny, right now!

2155
02:39:29,572 --> 02:39:30,937
God damn!

2156
02:39:32,208 --> 02:39:33,607
Red, go check that out!

2157
02:39:39,115 --> 02:39:40,548
We're getting covered!

2158
02:39:40,583 --> 02:39:42,380
Just hope they don't hit a prop!

2159
02:39:47,290 --> 02:39:48,450
I'm hit!

2160
02:39:48,491 --> 02:39:50,186
They're tearing
this plane apart!

2161
02:39:51,894 --> 02:39:53,885
Red, take it up, 800 feet.

2162
02:39:58,267 --> 02:40:01,759
I think Theo's dead!
Theo, wake up!

2163
02:40:01,804 --> 02:40:03,863
Theo!

2164
02:40:03,906 --> 02:40:05,339
Get into the clouds,
Danny, right now!

2165
02:40:05,374 --> 02:40:06,534
Get up in that soup!

2166
02:40:06,576 --> 02:40:08,942
We're gonna pull out of this,
Gooz!

2167
02:40:21,958 --> 02:40:23,289
Thank you, George.

2168
02:40:28,364 --> 02:40:29,797
What is it, General?

2169
02:40:29,832 --> 02:40:32,858
Colonel Doolittle had to
advance his execution order...

2170
02:40:32,902 --> 02:40:34,597
by twelve hours, Mr. President.

2171
02:40:34,637 --> 02:40:36,434
There will be no homing beacons.

2172
02:40:36,472 --> 02:40:39,134
The plane carrying them
crashed en route to China...

2173
02:40:39,175 --> 02:40:40,665
and our bombers
may lack the fuel...

2174
02:40:40,710 --> 02:40:42,439
to reach the mainland, sir.

2175
02:40:42,478 --> 02:40:48,041
So our boys are flying blind
on empty tanks.

2176
02:40:49,819 --> 02:40:51,844
God help them.

2177
02:40:59,795 --> 02:41:02,127
We're still not
getting a signal.

2178
02:41:02,164 --> 02:41:05,292
All ocean and no land.

2179
02:41:05,334 --> 02:41:07,097
Homing in on nothing.

2180
02:41:09,438 --> 02:41:11,565
How many cans of fuel
we got left?

2181
02:41:11,607 --> 02:41:13,541
These are all empty!

2182
02:41:14,577 --> 02:41:16,101
Is this all you got?

2183
02:41:16,145 --> 02:41:17,806
That's all we got, Red.

2184
02:41:17,847 --> 02:41:22,250
Rafe! You better pray for land!

2185
02:41:25,855 --> 02:41:27,550
Break radio silence.

2186
02:41:29,025 --> 02:41:31,721
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

2187
02:41:31,761 --> 02:41:34,059
You're all brave souls.

2188
02:41:34,096 --> 02:41:37,293
The bravest I've ever had
the privilege of flying with.

2189
02:41:37,333 --> 02:41:40,166
But we're on our own.

2190
02:41:44,807 --> 02:41:47,537
This really was
a suicide mission.

2191
02:42:03,159 --> 02:42:04,626
Engine one's fluctuating.

2192
02:42:04,660 --> 02:42:07,060
We'll lose it any minute.

2193
02:42:08,331 --> 02:42:10,993
- Rafe, you gotta prime it.
- I am. How about now?

2194
02:42:14,170 --> 02:42:16,400
I see the coast.

2195
02:42:19,008 --> 02:42:20,669
Copy that, Rafe.

2196
02:42:20,710 --> 02:42:22,405
We're gonna make it.

2197
02:42:22,445 --> 02:42:23,742
Danny, follow me.

2198
02:42:23,779 --> 02:42:25,576
We can make this.
I can see the coast now.

2199
02:42:25,615 --> 02:42:27,105
We're only a few miles out.

2200
02:42:27,149 --> 02:42:29,845
We gotta find
a soft landing spot.

2201
02:42:29,885 --> 02:42:31,614
I'm pushing up on two.

2202
02:42:31,654 --> 02:42:33,918
Hold on for a hard landing!

2203
02:42:33,956 --> 02:42:35,617
I see rice paddies.

2204
02:42:35,658 --> 02:42:37,023
We'll bring it in right here.

2205
02:42:39,395 --> 02:42:41,454
Oh, God, engine one's dead.

2206
02:42:41,497 --> 02:42:43,829
We'll lose engine two
any second.

2207
02:42:47,370 --> 02:42:49,736
We can make it in. Easy.

2208
02:42:49,772 --> 02:42:52,832
Pull it back, glide in on fumes.

2209
02:42:55,077 --> 02:42:56,271
Japs!

2210
02:42:56,312 --> 02:42:58,507
We got Jap patrols
all over the place!

2211
02:42:58,547 --> 02:43:01,243
Japs! Land somewhere else!

2212
02:43:01,283 --> 02:43:03,717
Strap yourselves in!
We're coming in hard!

2213
02:43:03,753 --> 02:43:05,448
We're a dead stick.

2214
02:43:05,488 --> 02:43:06,955
Get outta the nose!

2215
02:43:08,224 --> 02:43:10,556
Hold on, boys!
We're going down!

2216
02:43:12,728 --> 02:43:14,093
Watch the trees!

2217
02:43:37,920 --> 02:43:39,717
Everyone all right?

2218
02:43:41,090 --> 02:43:44,025
I'm OK!

2219
02:43:44,060 --> 02:43:46,585
Where's Ripley?

2220
02:43:46,629 --> 02:43:48,096
He's dead.

2221
02:43:49,265 --> 02:43:51,165
Watch for Japs!

2222
02:44:00,109 --> 02:44:02,339
- Jap patrols!
- Take cover!

2223
02:44:20,029 --> 02:44:21,428
Who's got magazines?

2224
02:44:21,464 --> 02:44:22,692
Got em!

2225
02:44:22,732 --> 02:44:25,223
Gotta get up into those hills,
find the Chinese!

2226
02:44:29,805 --> 02:44:31,705
They got us pinned down!

2227
02:44:46,822 --> 02:44:48,084
Rafe, you don't have a chance!

2228
02:44:51,861 --> 02:44:54,591
God damn. Danny!

2229
02:44:54,630 --> 02:44:56,063
Come on!

2230
02:45:00,503 --> 02:45:01,731
Gooz? You OK, man?

2231
02:45:01,771 --> 02:45:05,468
Danny? Shit, Anthony.

2232
02:45:05,508 --> 02:45:08,375
Gooz! Can you hear me?

2233
02:45:08,410 --> 02:45:10,401
- Yeah.
- Come on.

2234
02:45:11,781 --> 02:45:14,409
Danny. Easy.

2235
02:45:14,450 --> 02:45:15,940
I've had better landings.

2236
02:45:15,985 --> 02:45:17,350
You saved us back there.

2237
02:45:17,386 --> 02:45:19,081
I got something in my neck.

2238
02:45:19,121 --> 02:45:21,214
- Let me pull this out.
- Where's Gooz?

2239
02:45:21,257 --> 02:45:23,691
He's fine.
He's right over there.

2240
02:46:42,504 --> 02:46:44,267
Grenade!

2241
02:47:02,291 --> 02:47:04,418
Hold on!

2242
02:47:04,460 --> 02:47:06,121
Hold on, now. I got you.

2243
02:47:06,161 --> 02:47:08,755
You're all right.

2244
02:47:08,797 --> 02:47:11,288
I'm not gonna make it.

2245
02:47:15,271 --> 02:47:18,297
Yes, you are.
Now look at me.

2246
02:47:18,340 --> 02:47:23,676
Rafe, I'm so cold.

2247
02:47:23,712 --> 02:47:26,010
You're all right.

2248
02:47:32,421 --> 02:47:34,082
Can you do me a favor?

2249
02:47:34,123 --> 02:47:35,715
What?

2250
02:47:35,758 --> 02:47:39,922
Can you have someone else
write my name on the tombstone?

2251
02:47:39,962 --> 02:47:42,954
You're not gonna die.
Look at me, listen to me!

2252
02:47:42,998 --> 02:47:44,989
You ain't gonna die,
you hear me?

2253
02:47:47,036 --> 02:47:50,335
Danny, you can't die.
You know why?

2254
02:47:50,372 --> 02:47:52,272
'Cause you're gonna be a father.

2255
02:47:52,308 --> 02:47:54,640
You're gonna be a daddy.

2256
02:47:54,677 --> 02:47:58,875
I wasn't supposed to tell you.

2257
02:47:58,914 --> 02:48:01,144
You're gonna be a father.

2258
02:48:02,952 --> 02:48:05,079
Please.

2259
02:48:08,590 --> 02:48:10,683
No. You are.

2260
02:48:28,177 --> 02:48:30,236
Please!

2261
02:48:34,850 --> 02:48:37,512
God.

2262
02:48:37,553 --> 02:48:40,044
Please, Danny.

2263
02:48:50,332 --> 02:48:53,130
Hold your fire!
They're Chinese.

2264
02:50:14,383 --> 02:50:16,783
When the action is over
and we look back...

2265
02:50:16,819 --> 02:50:20,687
we understand
both more and less.

2266
02:50:20,722 --> 02:50:22,883
This much is certain.

2267
02:50:22,925 --> 02:50:24,517
Before the Doolittle raid...

2268
02:50:24,560 --> 02:50:26,994
America knew nothing
but defeat.

2269
02:50:27,029 --> 02:50:30,328
After it,
there was hope of victory.

2270
02:50:30,365 --> 02:50:33,630
Japan realized for the first
time that they could lose...

2271
02:50:33,669 --> 02:50:35,193
and began to pull back.

2272
02:50:35,237 --> 02:50:37,068
America realized
that she would win...

2273
02:50:37,106 --> 02:50:39,165
and surged forward.

2274
02:50:39,208 --> 02:50:43,304
It was a war that changed
America and the world.

2275
02:50:43,345 --> 02:50:45,438
Dorie Miller was
the first black American...

2276
02:50:45,481 --> 02:50:49,349
to be awarded the Navy Cross,
but he would not be the last.

2277
02:50:49,384 --> 02:50:52,478
He joined
a brotherhood of heroes.

2278
02:50:59,495 --> 02:51:02,328
That's for all the raiders.

2279
02:51:11,840 --> 02:51:14,809
World War II for us
began at Pearl Harbor...

2280
02:51:14,877 --> 02:51:18,369
and 1,177 men
still lie entombed...

2281
02:51:18,413 --> 02:51:20,347
in the battleship Arizona.

2282
02:51:21,350 --> 02:51:25,616
America suffered...
but America grew stronger.

2283
02:51:25,654 --> 02:51:27,781
It was not inevitable.

2284
02:51:27,823 --> 02:51:30,519
The times tried our souls...

2285
02:51:30,559 --> 02:51:34,017
and through the trial,
we overcame.

2286
02:51:54,650 --> 02:51:55,981
Hey, Danny...

2287
02:51:56,018 --> 02:52:00,045
how'd you like to go flying?

2288
02:52:00,088 --> 02:52:02,056
Come here.
