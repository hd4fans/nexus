那儿有上万瓶好酒
There's a million bottles of booze in there.

5
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,790
少个一两瓶不会被发现的

哥们  我从没闻过这样的味道  比厕所闻到的还糟
Man,I never smelt anything like this. Not even when you're in the crapper.

11
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,900
哦  怎么?  难到你的屎闻起来能像玫瑰花?
Oh,what,your shit smells like roses?

12
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,410
嘿  看
Hey,look.

14
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,080
-记得你说过这是酒  -那是文件上说的
-Thought you said it was booze.  -That's what the papers said.

15
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,260
船长  有人进入了底层  看
Captain,we have a breach in lower level. Look.

关门!  戴上防毒面具
Close the door! Get the masks.

20
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,440
哦靠
Holy shit.

21
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,110
把他们处理了
Take care of them.

22
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,290
-早上好  -请出示护照
-Morning.  -Passport,please.

23
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:25,960
海上很颠簸吧?
Rough seas?

24
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,840
海还挺平稳的  聚会有点吵  你懂的
The sea was smooth. The party was a bit rough,if you know what I mean.

25
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,570

小时候  爸爸经常带我去钓鱼
When I was a kid,my father used to take me fishing.

28
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,060
我一直不明白他怎么会知道哪里有鱼
Never could figure out how he knew where the fish were.

29
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,630
他说鱼在哪儿  鱼就一定在那儿
They were always exactly where he said they would be.

30
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,790
安全检查
Security check.

31
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,790
我看上去像危险分子吗?
Do I look like a security risk?

32
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,120
请下车  带上你的证件到办公室走一趟
Please step out of the car and bring your documents to the office.

33
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,560

The computer is in the office.

35
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,630

38
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,670
什么鬼东西?

39
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,520
快点  鱼要脱钩了
Come on. You're gonna lose it.

40
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,730
快了  长官  快了
Close,inspector,you're close.

41
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,540
是条大鱼  向左  向左
That's a big one. Go left,go left.

42
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,910
别让它跑了
Don't let him get away.

43
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,840
快钓上来了
You're close.

44
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,710
向左  向左!  向右!
Go left,go left! Go right!

45
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,620
一定是条白鲸  需要帮忙吗?
Must be Moby Dick you hooked. Need some help?

46
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,890
不  谢谢  弗兰克
No,thank you,Frank.

47
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:36,460
你还没出生的时候  我就在这片水域钓鱼了
I have been fishing these waters since before you were born.

48
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,240
你差点就钓到了  长官  就差一点儿
You were close,inspector. You were close.

49
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,480
幸好我们法国人都有很强的幽默感
Good thing that we French have such a highly developed sense of humor.

50
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,220
恕我直言  法国人认为杰瑞·刘易斯是个天才
With all due respect,the French think Jerry Lewis is a genius.

51
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,550
-杰瑞·刘易斯是个天才  -不过迪恩更是天才
-Jerry Lewis is a genius.  -Dean was the genius.

52
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,820
不  迪恩只是拿着瓶酒  叼根香烟站在那里
No,Dean just stood there with a drink and a cigarette.

53
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,000
我的意思是他可以让所有人都捧腹大笑
My point exactly. Anyone can fall down and get a laugh.

54
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,430
多少人可以做到?  只是站在那里  抽着烟  拿着酒
How many people can do it standing still with a drink and a cigarette?

55
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,430
喂?

56
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,430
喂  我是塔可尼

57
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,830
好的

58
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:24,180
恐怕我们的休闲日子得提前结束了
I am afraid our day of leisure is cut short.

59
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,850
马赛那儿现在一团糟
There is a big mess in Marseilles.

60
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,920
一个疯子驾着奥迪横冲直撞
Some madman driving an Audi at impossible speeds.

61
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,390
别看我
Don't look at me.

62
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,460
那是头要我看的第一个地方
That is the first place the chief told me to look.

63
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,830
但是我会告诉他你有完美的不在场证明
But I will tell him you have the perfect alibi.

64
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,230
就像往常一样
As usual.

65
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,140
塔可尼!

00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,520
把船停一下  快点
Stop the boat. Come on.

70
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,450
-不  不行  弗兰克  -快点  拜托了
-No. No,Frank.  -Come on,please.

71
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,260

73
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,830

部长先生  明天您将在欧盟会议上致开幕词
Mr. Minister,you're giving the opening address at an EU conference...

77
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,850
主题是工业对敖德萨环境的影响
...on environmental impact of industry in Odessa tomorrow.

78
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,790
-最为关键的一点是什么呢?  -很简单
-What is top on your list of priorities?  -It's a short list.

79
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,720
只有一项：环境及其保护措施
There's only one item: The environment and how to protect it.

80
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,730
在全球经济面临日益增长的压力时期
In the face of increasing pressure...

81
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,870
工业要竞争成功
...for industries to compete successfully in a global economy...

82
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:25,400
目标有时会和残酷的现实相冲突
...that goal can sometimes come up against some very harsh realities.

83
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,570
当然  再残酷也比不上一个  被污染成不适合居住的地球
Well,not as harsh as a polluted and uninhabitable planet.

84
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,470
先生们  请原谅
Gentlemen,if you'll excuse me now...

85
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,870
我得去拯救树木  让工业家们扫兴

86
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,780

89
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,280
部长先生?
Mr. Minister?

90
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,310
你是谁?
Who is this?

91
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,020
我的名字并不重要
My name is not important.

92
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,450
你和国际废弃物管理公司
I've been put in charge of the negotiations...

93
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,060
关于其在乌克兰营业许可的谈判
...you are engaged in with Ecocorp...

94
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,530
现在由我负责
...for issuance of their license to do business in the Ukraine.

95
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:27,200
你一定是搞错了  先生  不管你叫什么
You must be misinformed,Mr. Whatever-Your-Name-Is.

96
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,460
我已彻底结束了谈判
I've terminated negotiations permanently.

97
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,070
只要你看下信封里的资料
I think you will reconsider that position...

98
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:35,670
我想你会重新考虑的
...once you have a chance to study the documents in the envelope.

99
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,560
我会再联系
I'll be in touch.

100
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,160
是的  这里发生了事故
Yeah,there's been an accident.

请派救护车来  地址是德拉萨佛雷斯大街8号
Send an ambulance,8 Route de la Falaise.

102

马尔科姆
Malcolm.

103
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,550
马尔科姆  马尔科姆
Malcolm. Malcolm.

104
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,130
我是问你价钱  这是什么?
I asked you for your price. What is this?

105
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:14,400
一个可能会对这差事感兴趣的人  这个人会的
A man who might be interested in taking the job. This man will.

106
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,770
我老板说你是这差事的不二人选
My boss said you're the man for the job.

107
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,640
你老板搞错了
Your boss got his facts wrong.

108
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,040
关于我老板你得知道两件事：
Two things you should know about my boss:

109
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,480
他从不会搞错  他也从不接受拒绝
He never gets his facts wrong,he never takes no for an answer.

110
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,710
当然  凡事总有第一次
Well,there's a first time for everything.

111
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,420
但不会是这次
Well,not this time.

112
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,730
你不会真想这么做的
You don't wanna do this.

113
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:52,880
我想还轮不到你告诉我  什么该做  什么不该做
I don't think you're in a position to tell me what I do and don't wanna do.

114
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,050
你有10秒改变主意
You have 10 seconds to change your mind.

115
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,820
我给你5秒钟拿开你的手
I'll give you five seconds to remove your hand.

116
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,810
马尔科姆  马尔科姆
Malcolm. Malcolm.

117
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,010
听得到我吗?
You hear me?

118
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:12,020
马尔  我是说过欢迎随时拜访  但并不是说…
Mal,I said drop in anytime,but I didn't mean...

119
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:15,090
-我无处可去  -放松点好吗?
-Nowhere else to go.  -Just take it easy,okay?

120
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,020
别把我弄出去
Don't move me from the car.

121
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:22,190
-我只是在救护车来之前  帮你弄得舒服点  -不要叫救护车
-It's just get you comfortable till the ambulance arrives.  -No ambulance.

122
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,000
你需要医生  你中枪了  我处理不了这个
You need a doctor,you've been shot. I can't take care of this.

123
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,380
不能离开车子
Not far from car.

124
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,940
放松
Relax.

125

放松  保持镇定  你马上会得到救治的
Just try to stay calm. We'll have you fixed up in no time.

00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,990
他在里面  快点  伤得很严重
He's inside. Quick,it's serious.

127
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,990
这边?

128
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,560
先生?
Sir?

129
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,970
-移动他时得小心  -我们知道要怎么做
-You wanna be careful moving him.  -We know our job,okay?

130
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,660
先生  听得到我说话吗?
Sir,can you hear me?

131
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,400
这车…不…
This car... No...

132
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,130
如果听得到  按一下我的手
If you hear me,press my hand.

133
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,880
这车…
The car...

134
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,880
轻点  小心

135
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,880
差一点

136
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,030
我是在天堂吗?
Am I in heaven?

137
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,700
事实上你处于险境
Actually,you're in a bit of the shit.

138
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,860
那你会帮我脱离吗?
You'll help me out of it?

139
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,300
那取决于你陷得有多深了
That depends on how deep you're in.

140
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,800
-不要相信任何人  -我非常赞同
-Don't trust anyone.  -Couldn't agree with you more.

141
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,600
-来吧  -不!  不能离开这车
-Come on.  -No! Don't leave the car!

142
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:18,980
-这车有什么特殊的吗?  -不是这车
-What's so special about the car?  -Not the car.

143
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,960
等等!
Wait!

144
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,750
我告诉过你
I told you.

145
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,660
不要相信任何人
Don't trust anyone.

146
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,760
我告诉过你
I told you.

147
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,420
我冒昧给你弄了一套西服
I took the liberty of bringing your suit.

148
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,790
那是你工作时穿的  对吗?
It's what you wear when you're working,correct?

149
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,660
是的  但是我没在工作
Correct. But I'm not working.

150
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,290
-你看  老板?  我跟您说过  -行了  约瑟夫
-You see,boss? I told you.  -Please,Joseph.

151
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,960
看来首次提出建议  你没用对方法啊
Your approach was not very effective in presenting our proposal the first time.

152
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,730
谢谢
Thank you.

153
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,400
正如我说的
As I was saying...

154
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:27,740
我们真诚邀见  您却说您没空
...we came to you in good faith. You said you were unavailable.

155
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,380
我们联系了你给号码的那人
We contracted with the man whose number you gave us.

156
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,110
结果证明他无法胜任
He proved to be ineffective.

157
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,580
现在我的这差事还没完成
And now I am left with unfinished business.

158
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,090
在我看来  这是你的责任
The way I see it,you're responsible.

159
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,620
我理解你的意思
I understand your point of view.

160
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,020
但我还是没空
But I'm still unavailable.

161
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,500
老板  我能说点什么吗?
Boss,can I say something?

162
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,560
还有人想张口说话吗?
Anyone else wanna say something?

163
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,230
很好
Good.

164
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,530
给我找个聪明点的
Find me a smarter one.

165
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,900
你有3秒改变主意
You have three seconds to change your mind...

166
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,880
否则让你永远没空
...or you're gonna be permanently unavailable.

167
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,080
一
One.

168
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,340
二
Two.

169
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,650
有个条件
One condition.

170
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,290
洗耳恭听
I'm listening.

171
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,190
我要开自己的车
I drive my own car.

172
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,970
成交
Deal.

173
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:31,670
对你的回答早有预料  所以冒昧地把你的车带来了
In anticipation of your answer,we took the liberty of bringing your car.

174
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,810
换了油  对车子进行了调整  把不必要的东西都拿出来了
Changed the oil,gave it a tune-up,took out all the non-essential material.

175
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:39,540
留下了替换的牌照  喜欢吧
Left the switch-over license plates. Love that.

176
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,020
换上了我们自己的GPS
Replaced the GPS with one of our own.

177
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,090
安装了既定程序的GPS会更有效率的
Preprogrammed. More efficient that way.

178
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,520
我为什么这么坚持  用最适合的人来完成这项任务呢?
Why I was so insistent on using only the best man for this assignment?

179
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,700
我们在玩一个很大的游戏
We're playing in a much larger game here.

180
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:58,560
不要把它想成只是一份工作  把它当做使命
Don't think of this as just another job. Think of it as a mission.

181
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,440
我很高兴发现  对待工作方面我们有很多共同点
I'm so pleased to find we share the same approach to our work.

182
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,700
我说到做到  就像你一样
I make a deal,that's the deal. Just like you.

183
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,640
你不喜欢问别人名字  我也是  而且我们都很谨慎
You don't like names. Neither do I. We're both precise.

184
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,940
工作以外的事  我们都没有任何兴趣
Neither one of us has any interest in what we're paid to do...

185
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:16,110
那些是你的规则  对吧?
...beyond what we are paid to do. Those are your rules,right?

186
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,920
你忘了一条
You forgot one.

187
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,430
-我喜欢单干  -我本以为你会喜欢有个伴
-I work alone.  -I thought you might like the company.

188
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,200
我本以为你想我完成使命
Thought you wanted me to complete a mission.

189
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,240
你是对的  的确想
You're right. I do.

190
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,210
等等
Wait.

191
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:44,050
怎么  你想要改变规则?
What,you wanna change the rules?

192
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:48,420
每条规则总有例外  今天就破例一下
Every rule has an exception. Let's make one for today.

193
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,820
你说了算
You're the boss.

194
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,590
没问题了吗?
Anything else?

195
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,060
这个首饰  有什么我该知道的吗?
The jewelry. Anything I should know?

196
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,360
记得那些想要炸机的家伙么?
You remember those jokers trying to blow up airliners...

197
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,400
他们把液体偷偷带到飞机上  然后进行混合
...by sneaking liquids through and combining them onboard?

198
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,510
这个原理是一样的  只是更精制些
Same principle,just refined.

199
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,410
离车25英尺
Twenty-five feet from the car...

200
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:17,010
会亮黄色的灯  表示第一种液体已就绪
...yellow light comes on,signaling the first liquid is ready.

201
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,010
50英尺  亮橙色的灯
Fifty feet,orange.

202
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,550
加入第二种液体
Second liquid flows into the chamber.

203
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,720
75英尺  你会看到亮红色的灯
Seventy-five feet,you're gonna see red.

204
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,730
你们可以出发了
Time to go.

205
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:35,930
这部电话被设定只能拨一个号码  我的号码
This phone is programmed to call only one number,mine.

206
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,870
过了向北的第一个收费站  给我打电话清楚了吗?
When you pass the first toll on the road going north,call me,all right?

207
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:44,940
这是油钱和食物的钱
Money for gas and food.

208
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,340
还有其他问题吗?
Any other questions?

209
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,140
你可以系上安全带吗?
Would you mind buckling your seat belt?

210
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:34,220
难道你不告诉我这究竟是怎么一回事吗?
Don't suppose you wanna tell me what this is all about?

211
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,930
很好
Great.

212
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:00,210
海洋珍珠号请求货物清关
Ocean Pearl requesting cargo clearance.

213
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,410
文件已送至环保署
The papers are with the environmental agency.

214
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,720
抛锚等候停泊
Drop anchor and wait to dock.

215
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:09,550
-他们一签署  我们就通知你们  -好的
-We'll inform you when they're signed.  -Okay.

216
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,830
我知道你是怎么回事
I know what happened to you.

217
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,270
但不知道弗兰克是怎么回事?
But what happened to Frank?

218
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:33,110
情报局的梅德维德上校已收到所有的信息

219
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,120
他知道那是头等大事
He knows it's top priority.

220
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,880
他想让您知道  他会派最得力的人负责此事
He wants you to know he has his best men on it.

221
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:40,250
他会让此事避开官方渠道
He'll keep it out of official channels.

222
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,120
他建议您尽量争取时间
He suggests you buy as much time as you can.

223
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,120
长官

224
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,920
车能拖去实验室吗?

225
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,920
告诉他们开始吧  这完了我就过去

226
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,920
他说开工

227
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,920
操!

228
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,920
移开!

229
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,120
警察在办公!

230
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:44,280
听着  我不知道这事你扮演的是什么角色  我也不关心
Look,I don't know what your part in all this is or isn't. And I don't really care.

231
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,790
但既然你先加入  知道的定比我多
You were here first,you know more than I do...

232
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,690
把你知道的告诉我
...download me on what you know.

233
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,450
我什么都不知道
I know nothing.

234
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,860
你怎么认识马尔科姆的?
How did you know Malcolm?

235
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,290
我不认识
I didn't.

00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,730
不久前你差点就和他死在车上了  你不认识?
You just happened to end up in a car with a man you don't know?

237
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:02,000
我现在也和一个我不认识的男人坐在车上
I'm now in a car with man I don't know.

238
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,500
你不是该打电话了吗?
Aren't you supposed to make a call?

239
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,350
很高兴接到你的电话
Nice to hear from you.

240
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:17,610
客套话就免了  把密码给我
You can skip the pleasantries. Just give me the code.

241
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,580
1  1  2  6
1-1-2-6.

242
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:26,230
到了再打给我
Call me when you arrive.

243
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:30,400
布达佩斯那儿有什么?
What's in Budapest?

244
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,870
菜炖牛肉  啤酒
Goulash. Beer.

245
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,110
很好
All right.

246
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:44,110
我们重新来过  从自我介绍开始
Let's rewind here,start with the proper introductions.

247
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,270
你办事不是从不问姓名的吗?
What happened to the rule of no names?

248
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:50,550
那条规则暂时先放一放
I'm suspending that rule for the moment.

249
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:55,820
我叫弗兰克·马丁
I'm Frank Martin.

250
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,560
你的名字是?
And your name is?

251
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,130
为什么一定要问我名字?
What matters,my name?

252
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,640
好吧  眼下我们是一根绳上的蚂蚱
Well,we're in this situation together.

253
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,730
不
No.

254
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:17,140
我们俩都戴着带有爆炸装置的手镯坐在这儿  目的地相同
We're sitting here with two exploding bracelets on,going to the same place.

255
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,250
这就叫坐在一条船上
I'd call that being in the same situation.

256
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,280
错了  他们会杀了你
It's not. They are going to kill you.

257
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,280
我知道
I'm aware of that.

258
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,250
十有八九  他们杀了我之后  你就是下一个
In all probability,after they kill me,you're next on the list.

259
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,990
现在  想要保命  我就需要点帮助
Now,if I'm gonna keep that from happening,I'm gonna need a little help.

260
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,830
首先  我们有这个难题
From the top. We have this problem.

261
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,000
你认为我不知道这个是难题吗?
You think I don't know it's a problem?

262
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,340
我看上去很白痴吗?
I look stupid to you?

263
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,530
我没这么说过
I didn't say you were stupid.

264
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,640
但是我们确实有个难题
But we have a problem

265
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:52,510
在解决这个难题方面  你不是很协助
and you're not being very helpful in participating in the solution of it.

266
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:56,450
我不想再说了
I don't want to talk anymore.

267
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,090
好吧
Fine.

268
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,210
你刚才说你叫什么名字?
What did you say your name was?

269
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:24,150
弗兰克  弗兰克·马丁
Frank. Frank Martin.

270
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:27,280
弗兰克·马丁
Frank Martin.

271
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,680
瓦伦蒂娜

很高兴认识你
Pleased to meet you.

273
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,250
长官  GPS已经被拆掉了

274
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:20,850
长官?

275
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,250
没错  GPS已被拆了

276
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,410
国际废弃物管理公司的人到了
The gentlemen from Ecocorp are here.

277
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,050
带他们进来
Show them in.

278
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,850
先生们
Gentlemen.

279
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,660
部长先生
Mr. Minister.

280
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:52,740
很感谢您在匆忙间能重新考虑我们的建议
We'd like to thank you for reconsidering our proposal

281
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,870
想不考虑都难
-on such short notice.  -You make it very hard not to.

282
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:59,700
恩  是的  我们向来不接受拒绝
Well,yes. We do have a reputation of not taking no for an answer.

283
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,110
合约在这儿
Here are the contracts.

284
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,040
一切准备就绪
All in order.

285
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,910
我们被告知船队不能清关
We were told the ships couldn't be cleared

286
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,110
除非得到您的亲笔签名
unless you personally signed off on them.

287
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,650
船队?
Ships?

288
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,660
我以为只有一条船
I thought there was only one.

289
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,330
哦  好吧  是这样的
Oh,well,here's the thing.

290
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:19,260
为了使这次冒险更具利润
In order to make the venture more profitable

291
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:22,430
我们需要大量处理原料
we need to process the material in a volume that makes sense.

292
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,260
现在我们谈论的船只有多少?
How many ships are we talking about?

293
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:28,240
加上港口等候清关的  总共有8条
Plus the one in the port waiting on clearance,eight.

294
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,070
8条
Eight.

295
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,600
今年
This year.

296
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,900
保护环境是项长期的承诺
Protecting the environment is a long-term commitment.

297
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:38,110
您说过  不是吗?
You've said so yourself,haven't you?

298
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,840
我明天在敖德萨还会说
And I will do again tomorrow in Odessa

299
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:43,920
到时我再签
where I will sign these.

300
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:47,650
我们非常希望今天就能解决
We were really hoping to settle this today.

301
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:52,230
我要再看看  后面还有些附录
I want to review them,now that there are some addendums.

302
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:54,590
对这样的长期承诺来说
Twenty-four hours doesn't make a difference

303
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,170
24小时并不能改变什么  不是吗?
on such a long-term commitment,will it?

304
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,630
是的  当然不能
No,of course not.

305
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,830
那么我们明天敖德萨见  早上九点
Then I will see you tomorrow in Odessa. Let's say 9 a.m.

306
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,110
好的
Yes.

307
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,050
好的  我等着
Okay,I'll stay.

308
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,880
-但是原料正在四处泄漏  -然后呢?
-But the material is leaking everywhere.  -And?

309
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,650
-我们会瞒不住的  -我会处理的  给我点时间
-We won't be able to hide it.  -I'll take care of it,just give me some time.

310
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,150
如果他们来检查
If ever they check...

311
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,660
别紧张  交易很快就会达成的
Easy. The deal will be closed very soon.

312
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,490
24小时  不能再拖了
Twenty-four hours. No more.

313
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:37,370
-喂?  -我为你们又争取了24小时
-Yes?  -I've bought you another 24 hours.

314
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,870
到明天早上9点
You have until tomorrow,9 a.m.

315
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,910
那时间应该绰绰有余
That should be more than enough time.

316
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,350
有线索了吗?
Do you have a lead?

317
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,350
不止有线索
Better than a lead.

318
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,170
还有一台定位器
A location.

319
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,170
长官

320
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:03,170
国际刑警认出了车牌

321
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:08,770
是通往罗多夫路上的一台测速器拍到的

322
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,000
联系我们的德国朋友们

323
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,170
是  可我要说什么呢?

324
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:17,170
期待与我共进晚餐吧

325
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,730
我饿了
I'm hungry.

326
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,250
再有100公里就有啤酒和香肠了
We're 100 kilometers from beer and sausage.

327
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:36,130
我不喜欢香肠
I don't like sausage.

328
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,870
那喜欢什么?
What would you like?

In gravy,with Madeira in stock.

333
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,520
不来份前菜吗?
Nothing to start?

334
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:02,060
一份色拉
A salad.

335
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:05,930

当然  陈年的

339
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,700

342
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,310
要
With.

343
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,950
喝什么?

344
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,080

-你在干嘛?  -去见一个珠宝专家
-What are you doing?  - Seeing a man about some jewelry.

349
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:05,610
他偏离了设定路线
He's gone off the reservation.

350
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:11,290
派人叫他回归路线
Send someone to get him back on.

351
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,860
别杀了他

352
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:43,220
弗兰克  见到你真高兴  我的朋友
Frank. It's so good to see you,mein Freund.

353
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,830
我也是  奥托
Good to see you too,Otto.

354
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,690
你没提过要带伴来
You didn't mention you bring company.

355
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,360
不是真的伴
It's not really company.

356
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,530
这…
It's...

357
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,830
很复杂
complicated.

358
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,010
和你一起总会很复杂
With you,it's always complicated. But you can tell me about it...

359
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:01,940
我准备了美味的土豆色拉炸排条  我们可以边吃边聊
over a nice schnitzel with Kartoffelsalat I have prepared.

360
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,740
嘿  奥托  你知道我喜欢你的炸排条
Hey,Otto,you know I love your schnitzel

361
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:07,380
但是我们得先弄掉这个
but we need to get rid of this first.

362
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,380
噢  这是自由式二元磁性分解技术
Binary free-form magnetic-resolution technology.

363
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:15,090
拜托  说英文  奥托
English,please,Otto.

364
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,550
五角大楼通过他们的一家附属前台公司
There's a program the Pentagon has funded

365
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,860
资助开发了一套程序
through one of their subsidiary front companies

366
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:25,400
就是根据磁引力理论
that's been experimenting with this new kind of weaponry

367
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,230
测试的一种新式武器
based on the theory of magnetic attraction.

368
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,460
这是限制级机密
Very hush-hush stuff.

369
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:35,040
没想到你还能搞到五角大楼限制级机密
I didn't realize you were in the loop on the Pentagon hush-hush.

370
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:37,270
当你在互联网上漫步时
You wouldn't believe what you can discover

371
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,640
你会惊讶自己所发现的东西
when you left your fingers walking through the Internet.

372
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:42,080
你想看看入侵伊朗的计划吗?
You wanna see the invasion plans for Iran?

373
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,280
也许下次吧
Maybe some other time.

374
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:47,930
现在  我们得把这玩意儿弄下来  不然我会被轰到伊朗去的
Right now we need to get this thing off without blowing myself to Iran.

375
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:50,560
我不想拿细节来烦你
I don't wanna bother you with the details

376
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:55,290
但通常这儿附近会有个发射器
but usually there's a transmitter plate close by.

377
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,970
你不必这么做
You should not be doing this.

378
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:05,170
起先你不说  现在却提建议
First you don't talk,now you offer advice.

379
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,840
不是建议  是警告
Not advice. A warning.

380
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,170
就算是  你不觉得这警告迟了点吗?
Well,a little late for warnings,don't you think?

381
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,150
我同意
I agree with you.

382
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:24,320
你偏离路线了
You're off course.

383
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:33,060
-我继续吗?  -是的  你继续
-Should I?  - Yeah,you should.

384
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,630
听着  伙计们
Look,fellas

385
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,380
车子有点问题  需要检查一下
some things in the car were a bit off,needed checking.

386
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:48,120
男人得和他驾驶的车一样棒  这是职业经验
In my profession,a man is only as good as the car he drives.

387
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,520
你照顾好车  车就会照顾好你
You take care of the car,the car will take care of you.

388
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:56,020
老板说  "回到原路线"
The boss says," Back on the road."

389
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,860
弗兰克?
Frank?

390
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,650
继续
Keep at it.

391
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:03,530
回车上  弗兰克
Back in the car,Frank.

392
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,430
不
No.

393
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,900
-找到了吗?  -没有
-Find it?  - Not yet.

394
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,250
你是最厉害的?
You're the smart one?

395
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:40,050
不  我是最大个的
No. I'm the big one.

396
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,540
不再是大家伙了  不是吗?
Not so big anymore,are you?

397
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:57,960
找到了
Found it.

398
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:04,700
-发射器  -你能移除吗?
-The transmitter.  -Can you remove it?

399
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:08,200
接着电线
It's wired.

400
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,540
如果移除就会爆炸
If I do: it comes boom.

401
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:10,530
打得不错
You fight good.

402
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,670
但领带打得够烂的
But your tie bad.

403
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,310
你到哪儿去?
Where are you going?

404
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,620
累了
Tired.

405
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:28,020
那就是我更愿意和车打交道的原因
That's why I prefer to deal with cars.

406
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:30,550
英雄所见
That makes two of us.

407
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:34,060
他们醒了之后  我要怎么办?
What do you want me to do when they...? When they wake up?

408
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:37,330
或许最好挨下来放个假
Probably best to take the rest of the day off.

409
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:56,810
我很不爽
I'm not amused.

410
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,890
如果你死的话  你会更不爽
You'd be less amused if you ended up dead.

411
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:01,490
你想要我死的话我早就死了  可你要我活着
If you wanted me dead,I'd be dead. You need me alive.

412
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:04,490
想要我完成这件任务  我需要一些解释
You want me to complete the job,I need some clarification.

413
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:07,220
我在听
I'm listening.

414
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,820
单独的
In person.

415
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,470
是单独的
We've already done in person.

416
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,760
显然  我并不满意
Well,not to my satisfaction,apparently.

417
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,410
现在  我是否满意是你首要关心的问题
Right now,my satisfaction should be your main concern.

418
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:20,030
同一地点  1小时后  等我电话
Same place. One hour. Wait for my call.

419
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:17,990
喂?
Hello?

420
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,140
你让我很失望
You've disappointed me.

421
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:23,400
你不会是第一个  也不会是最后一个
You won't be the first and you won't be the last.

422
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:28,370
-我告诉过你我想单独做这事  -没必要  你瞧…
-I told you I wanted to do this in person.  -That won't be necessary. You see...

423
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:30,640
在我们开始谈话的时候
since our little chat at the beginning

424
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:34,340
我就在想  我并不需要  最棒的人来完成这项平凡的任务
I've been thinking I don't need the best for this mundane assignment.

425
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:36,710
任何一个有驾驶证的白痴都可以完成
Any idiot with a driver's license will do.

426
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,950
引用伟大的美国人唐纳德·特朗普的话
So in the words of the great American,Donald Trump:

427
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,490
很抱歉  你被解雇了
I'm sorry,but you're fired.

428
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:30,860
你是谁?
Who are you?

429
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,870
-你的新司机  -我要以前的那个
-Your new chauffeur.  - I want the old one back.

430
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,410
他就要被炸成碎片了
He's about to go to pieces.

431
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,210
你被解雇了
You're fired.

432
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:51,080
睡得怎么样?
How was your nap?

433
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,860
很安稳  你电话打得怎么样了?
Restful. How was your phone call?

434
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:56,530
很短  系好你的安全带
Brief. Fasten your seat belt.

435
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,430
塔可尼
Tarconi.

436
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,660
是我
It's me.

437
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,570
我就在想你什么时候打给我
I was wondering when you would call.

438
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:14,970
我在忙
I've been busy.

439
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:17,810
让我猜猜  在布达佩斯?
Let me guess. In Budapest?

440
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,410
你也在忙
You've been busy too.

441
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,750
和你联系没有问题  弗兰克
Never a problem keeping that way with a friend like you,Frank.

442
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:26,790
那我就不多说了  告诉我你所知道的
So I don't have to be redundant,tell me what you know.

443
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:29,420
在布达佩斯也有辆黑色的梅赛德斯
There is a black Mercedes also in Budapest.

444
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:31,690
很可能不归你的朋友所有
Probably not occupied by friends of yours.

445
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:34,520
那是我所知道的  现在告诉我你所知道的
That is what I know. Now tell me what you know.

446
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:38,670
我有两个包在后备箱  一个女孩在前座
I have two bags in the back and a girl in the front.

447
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:40,770
我猜是俄国人
Russian,I think.

448
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,170
我不知道她跟这一切有什么关系
I don't know what she has to do with anything.

449
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:45,340
你有试着问过她吗?
Have you tried asking her?

450
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,600
-我会没想过?  -抱歉
-Now,why didn't I think of that?  -Sorry.

451
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:49,510
你一定问过了  她怎么说?
Of course you've asked. And she says?

452
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:51,440
我会死
I'm going to die.

453
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:53,950
典型的俄国人
Typical. Russians.

454
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:56,350
他们太悲观了
They are so dark.

455
00:46:56,550 --> 00:47:00,050
我记得  在学校的时候  读着陀思妥耶夫斯基的书
I remember,in school,reading Dostoyevsky and thinking

456
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:02,920
然后想  这些人什么时候才会笑呢?
when do these people laugh?

457
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:04,790
一页又一页
One page after the other

458
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,960
写着令你无法相信的痛苦和折磨  弗兰克
misery and suffering like you wouldn't believe,Frank.

459
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:11,570
长官  我们可以忽略这节文学课吗?  我这儿灯正在闪
Inspector,can we save the literature lesson? I'm blinking here.

460
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:12,960
是电码吗?
Is that code?

461
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:17,340
不  是他们给我们带上的类似手镯的饰物
No,it's some bracelet they accessorized us with.

462
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:19,770
设定了如果我们离车太远就会爆炸
Wired to explode if we get too far from the car.

463
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:20,970
他们?
They?

464
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,700
是些美国人
Some American.

465
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:25,780
可以再详细点吗?  一个名字或一个号码?
Can you be more specific? A name? A number?

466
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,010
没了
Nothing.

467
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:29,410
你怎么总能镇定自若呢  弗兰克?
Why do you always make it so easy,Frank?

468
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:31,320
是本能
It's my nature.

469
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,350
你在哪儿?  我来找你
Where are you? I will come there.

470
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,030
这可不是个好主意  我被看得很紧
That's not a good idea. They have me on a short leash.

471
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:39,060
如果你不告诉我些东西  我就帮不上什么忙
I can't be of much help if you do not give me something.

472
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,820
你离电脑近吗?
How close are you to a computer?

473
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:47,760
喂  弗兰克?
Yes,Frank?

474
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:50,740
被扔在市场上  是不是很不爽
That wasn't very nice,back there in the market.

475
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:53,770
破坏规则的人是你  不是我
You were the one who broke the rules,not me.

476
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:56,040
我承认
Point well taken.

477
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:59,840
我们扯平了  重新来过怎么样?
That makes us even. What say we start with a clean slate?

478
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:03,180
所以这通电话表示握手言和咯?
So this call is about kiss-and-make-up,then?

479
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:04,880
差不多吧
More or less.

480
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,990
你有办法去掉这手镯
You have what I need to get the bracelet off...

481
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:11,020
我有你需要快递的包裹
...I have the packages you need delivered.

482
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:14,590
这儿是新坐标  2-6-12
Here are the new coordinates,then: 2-6-12.

483
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,470
那可以带你
That'll take you to the place...

484
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:18,970
到结束交易的地方
...where we can have a conclusion to this business.

485
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:20,900
我很期待
I look forward to it.

486
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:28,210
弗兰克
Frank.

487
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:29,610
你查到了吗?
Did you get it?

488
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,550
查到了信号  给我们一点时间
Got the signal. Give us a little time...

489
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,980
我们就能查到他的号码和位置
...and we should have his number and location.

490
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,090
你的新电话  先生
Your new phone,sir.

491
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:50,930
-还有别的事吗?  -没有
-Anything else?  -No.

492
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:58,140
弗兰克  你知道这个信号要带你去哪儿吗?
Frank,do you know where the signal is taking you?

493
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:12,650
我知道那儿有家饭店  那儿的鱼你从没吃过
I know restaurant there. Fish like you never had.

494
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:16,020
和小胡萝卜一起烤  还有黑胡椒
Roasted with small carrots and black pepper.

495
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:18,790
罗马尼亚的葡萄酒不是很好
Romanian wine,not so good.

496
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,230
作为最后的晚餐  可能差了点
But for the last meal,could be worse.

497
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:29,000
你应该乐观点
You really should begin to think more positive.

498
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:31,570
我是现实主义者
I'm realist.

499
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:36,170
我朋友是对的  他说你悲观绝望
My friend was right when he said you were doom and gloom.

500
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:39,250
什么意思?
What means "doom and gloom"?

501
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:42,380
你只看到恐惧和害怕
You know,you only see the horrible and the terrible.

502
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:45,560
你的朋友  他怎么知道?  他又不认识我
Your friend,where does he get this? He doesn't know me.

503
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:49,050
他只是大体描述了一下  一个俄国人
He was talking about you in general. Russians,as a people.

504
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:51,390
我不是俄国人  我是乌克兰人
I'm not Russian. I'm Ukrainian.

505
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:53,150
抱歉
Excuse me.

506
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:57,420
不接受  我们不是同一类人
Not excused. We're different people. We're different here...

507
00:49:57,630 --> 00:49:58,790
我们这儿  那儿都不同
...and here.

508
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:08,470
个人觉得  你还是有点乐观的
Me,personally,I think there's a little bit of an optimist in you.

509
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:12,450
你如何下的定论?  你又不了解我
How you can make such a statement? You don't know me.

510
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:16,780
哦  我看见你在化妆
Well,I see you're putting makeup on.

511
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:20,480
如果你确定我们要死  为什么还要多此一举呢?
If you were so convinced we was gonna die,why bother?

512
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:26,460
要漂亮和死有什么关系吗?
What does looking good have to do with dying?

513
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,330
嘿
Hello.

514
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:37,500
那是什么?
What's that?

515
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:40,180
伊比沙岛的特产  你想来一颗吗?
Souvenirs from Ibiza. Do you want one?

516
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,500
不  谢谢  你也不要吃  我们需要保持清醒
No,thank you. And neither do you. We need to stay sharp.

517
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:47,280
好的
Okay.

518
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:53,880
你要保持清醒
You stay sharp.

519
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:56,960
我也要  你怎么说的?  乐观?
I stay,how you say? Optimist?

520
00:50:57,430 --> 00:51:00,790
把它给我  给我  把药丸给我!
Give me that. Give me that thing. Give me the pill!

521
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,360
给我
Give me that...

522
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:12,600
天呢
Jesus.

523
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,710
好极了
Great.

524
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:22,080
-真棒  -来吧  弗兰克·马丁  高兴点儿
-Just great.  -Come on,Frank Martin,lighten up.

525
00:51:22,290 --> 00:51:24,150
我要高兴?  药丸发作的时候要怎么办?
I should? How about when those pills hit?

526
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:26,980
你会high得跟他妈的圣诞树似的
You're gonna be lighting up like a goddamn Christmas tree.

527
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:28,250
那会很不错
That would be nice.

528
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:31,290
无聊  无聊  无聊?
Boring. Boring. Boring?

529
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,430
哦  耶
Oh,yeah.

530
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,460
你应该呆车里
You should stay in the car.

531
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,140
你要我在车里尿尿吗?
You want me to pee in car?

532
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,610
好吧  去吧
Okay. Go on.

533
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,880
记住
You remember.

534
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:56,910
不行
Don't.

535
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,660
不行

536
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:22,090
不行
Don't.

537
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:43,780
哦  不是吧

00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:25,490
-别喝了  好吗?  -为什么?  我又不开车
-Stop,all right?  -Why? I don't drive.

539
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:26,930
我只是想开心点
I want to have fun.

540
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:30,470
我想要开心点  你也应该开心点而不是那么严肃
I want to be happy. You should try happy instead of so serious.

541
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:33,830
保持乐观很重要  就像你说的  不是吗?
It's important to stay positive,like you say,yeah?

542
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:37,240
-和我一起喝  弗兰克  -我不想喝
-Drink with me,Frankie.  -I don't want a drink.

543
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:42,510
现在谁是悲观绝望的?
Now who is all gloomy and doomy?

544
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,650
我说的对吗?  悲观绝望?
I say it right? Gloomy doomy?

545
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:47,820
够了  快上车
Come on,get in the car.

546
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:50,980
我是自由的  就像鸟一样
I am free,like a bird.

547
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,770
是那个女孩!  快点!  快开!
The girl! Come on! Faster!

548
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:12,140
-我弄丢了我的朋友!  -我会再给你买一瓶的
-I have lost my friend!  -I'll buy you a new one.

549
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:28,520
知道为什么有辆车在我们屁股后面吗?
Have any idea why we have a car on our ass?

550
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:31,230
我不知道  我不在乎
I don't know. I don't care.

551
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:35,970
-你介意?  -起先你说我是悲观绝望的
-You mind?  -First you say I'm doom and gloom...

552
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:39,010
现在你又叫我不要开心?  变来变去
...and now you tell me do not be happy? Make up your mind.

553
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:31,160
-喂  弗兰克?  -我想我们已达成了协议
-Yes,Frank?  -I thought we had an agreement.

554
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,590
是的
We do.

555
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:34,690
这和后面的车没关系吧
It had nothing to do with a car on my ass.

556
00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:40,770
我跟那没有关系  是和你有仇的人吧?
I don't have anything to do with that. Someone else has issues with you?

557
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:42,770
可能吧
Likely.

558
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:48,880
我想是其他势力的人在办事
What I think is that there are other forces at work here.

559
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,480
让我查一下  看看我能查到些什么
Let me check into it,see what I can find out.

560
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,270
那这期间我要做什么?
What do I do in the meantime?

561
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,640
开快点
Drive faster.

562
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,420
他到底在干嘛?
What the hell is he doing?

563
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:36,210
那儿!
There!

564
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:37,820
他在那儿!
He's down there!

565
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:44,690
我饿了
I'm hungry.

566
00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:47,060
早该想到买三明治而不是伏特加
Should have thought about a sandwich,not vodka.

567
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:50,360
看!
Look!

568
00:58:56,770 --> 00:58:58,900
我刚才不饿  而是口渴
I wasn't hungry then,I was thirsty.

569
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:00,770
为什么对我那么小气?
Why you are so mean to me?

570
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:05,270
-我不是小气  我是全神贯注  -什么叫全神贯注?
-I'm not being mean. I'm preoccupied.  -What means "preoccupied"?

571
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:12,510
意思是全神贯注
That means preoccupied.

572
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:26,240
打轮胎!  快!  抓住他!
Shoot the tires! Come on! Get him!

573
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:30,630
-往下面!  -打他!
-Get down!  -Shoot him!

574
00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:42,650
混蛋!
Bloody hell!

575
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:53,920
快!
Faster!

576
01:00:00,370 --> 01:00:02,000
阻止那辆车!
Stop the car!

577
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:04,100
哦  妈的!
Oh,shit!

578
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:10,500
你在干嘛?
What are you doing?

579
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:12,170
你太紧张了
You're so tense.

580
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:14,600
不用你说
You don't say.

581
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:20,840
我帮你放松  如何?
I make you relax,okay?

582
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:25,020
-好的  -我很在行的
-Yeah.  -I'm good at this.

583
01:01:25,490 --> 01:01:27,720
消除紧张
Making tense go away.

584
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:37,890
你在干嘛?
What are you doing?

585
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:42,870
我想在临死前再感受一次性爱
I want to feel sex one more time before I die.

586
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:44,540
你不想吗?
Don't you?

587
01:01:46,810 --> 01:01:49,240
这和你还有死有什么关系?
What is it with you and dying?

588
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:53,340
我有什么问题吗?
There is something wrong with me?

589
01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:55,210
我不性感吗?
Am I not sexy?

590
01:01:56,590 --> 01:01:57,710
不  你很性感
Yeah,you're sexy.

591
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:04,750
你是同性恋
You're the gay.

592
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:09,290
不  我不是同性恋
Nope,I am not the gay.

593
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,400
我不介意
I don't mind.

594
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:14,940
我不是  好伐?
I'm not,okay?

595
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:20,040
那是什么问题?
Then what's the problem?

596
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:25,940
你有没有想过  也许我没心情呢?
Did it ever occur to you that maybe I'm not in the mood?

597
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:46,790
-我想规则是不能打开包裹的  -是的
-I thought rule is don't open package.  -It is.

598
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,700
如果你违反了规则  还要规则干嘛?
Why you have rules if you break them?

599
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:51,670
我也一直在问自己同样的问题
I keep asking myself the same thing.

600
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:55,130
电话簿
Phone books.

601
01:03:03,550 --> 01:03:05,950
-你是那个包裹  -没错
-You're the package.  -Yes.

602
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:08,350
应该早点说
Could have said something.

603
01:03:08,890 --> 01:03:11,490
-有区别吗?  -有
-Would it make a difference?  -Yes.

604
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:14,930
你要干嘛?
Now what are you doing?

605
01:03:15,130 --> 01:03:17,570
你知道  在车库后面
You know,back in garage...

606
01:03:17,770 --> 01:03:22,640
当你脱掉衣服的时候  让我觉得很兴奋
...it was very turn-on to me when you take off your clothes.

607
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,500
我当时正竭力不让五个白痴抓到
I was trying to keep five cretins from caving my head in.

608
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:27,140
我不觉得有什么好兴奋的
I don't see the turn-on in that.

609
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:32,410
你认为只有男人会对脱衣舞兴奋吗?
You think it's only man gets turned on by striptease?

610
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:34,640
我不想事情变成那样  瓦伦蒂娜
I don't like where this is going,Valentina.

611
01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:37,820
你能再为我脱一次吗?
Would you striptease for me again?

612
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:41,150
把钥匙给我  这不好玩
Give me the keys. This is not funny.

613
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:42,480
你想要钥匙吗?
You want keys?

614
01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:49,330
我想要你停止玩闹
I want you to stop playing around,is what I want.

615
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:52,800
也许这是我们最后一次机会玩闹了
Maybe it's last chance to play around for you and for me.

616
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,490
现在不是玩的时间也不是玩的地点
This is not the time or the place for playing.

617
01:03:55,710 --> 01:03:59,770
为什么我会感觉这从来不是时间或地点的问题?
Why do I get feeling with you it's never time or place?

618
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:02,270
如果我想要分析一下  就会见心理医生
If I wanna get analyzed,I'll see a psychiatrist.

619
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,710
现在  把钥匙给我
Now,give me the keys.

620
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:07,580
来吧  弗兰克·马丁
Come on,Frank Martin.

621
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:10,010
和我一起玩吧
Make playtime for me.

622
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:32,560
行了嘛?  够了吗?
All right? That enough?

623
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:35,540
不够  那不是脱衣舞  弗兰克
Not enough. That is not a striptease,Frank.

624
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:39,240
脱衣舞是性感的  你知道  扭扭屁股啊
Striptease is sexy. You know,move your ass a little.

625
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:41,610
来吧  弗兰克·马丁
Come on,Frank Martin.

626
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,820
你想要钥匙吗?
You want keys?

627
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:47,020
我想要脱衣舞
I want strip.

628
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:55,820
让我做这些  你知道会有什么后果吗?
You know what I'm gonna do to you for making me do this?

629
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:57,470
打我?
Spank me?

630
01:04:58,030 --> 01:04:59,260
那只是开始
For starters.

631
01:04:59,470 --> 01:05:02,060
-把我捆起来吗?  -你喜欢那样  不是吗?
-Tie me up?  -You'd like that,wouldn't you?

632
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:06,130
我喜欢暴力
I like the rough stuff.

633
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:11,500
真的?
Really?

634
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:18,580
哦  但是不要太暴力了
Oh,but not too rough.

635
01:05:19,590 --> 01:05:21,960
交易是脱衣舞交换钥匙
Deal was a striptease for the keys.

636
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:25,620
新的交易  吻我交换钥匙
New deal. Kiss me for the keys.

637
01:05:33,270 --> 01:05:34,670
用心点
Like you mean it.

638
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,040
你有用心吻过一个人吗  弗兰克?
Do you ever kiss like you mean it,Frank?

639
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:47,550
我想也许没有
I'm thinking maybe not.

640
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:50,010
我想你独自生活
I'm thinking you live alone.

641
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:52,950
无论在家还是在外
Inside and outside.

642
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:56,730
我想你不是惧怕死亡
Thinking it is not dying you're afraid of.

643
01:05:56,930 --> 01:05:58,790
而是惧怕生活
It's living.

644
01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:00,590
和我一起生活吧
Live with me.

645
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,560
就这一次
Just this once.

646
01:06:02,770 --> 01:06:06,220
就这会儿  和我一起活着
Just this moment. Live with me.

647
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:50,480
-他现在在什么位置?  -我们失去了他的信号
-What's his position?  -We lost him.

648
01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:56,540
他进了山区  我们接收不到那里的信号
He headed into the mountains. We can't get reception up there.

649
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:59,150
侵入军用卫星
Hack into one of the military satellites.

650
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:07,450
喂
Yes.

651
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:09,930
您认为我们是在玩游戏吗  部长先生?
You think we're playing games here,Mr Minister?

652
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:11,930
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

653
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:15,470
我在说一辆黑色轿车  载满了一群你的无能手下
I'm talking about a black car full of your incompetent operatives.

654
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:18,730
再有这样的举动  你就别想再见到你的女儿了
One more move like that and you will never see your daughter again.

655
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:20,340
我要听听她的声音
I want to hear her voice.

656
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:23,170
等合约签好传过来之后吧
When the contract is signed and delivered.

657
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:25,780
听不到她的声音  我是不会签字的
I will not sign until I hear her voice.

658
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:28,580
你现在没有强硬的资格  部长先生
You are in no position to play hardball,Mr Minister.

659
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:31,410
那你也没有  约翰逊先生
Well,neither are you,Mr Johnson.

660
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:34,280
没错  我知道你是谁
Yes,I know who you are.

661
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:37,680
我可以向你保证  如果我女儿有任何闪失
And I can assure you,if anything happens to my daughter...

662
01:07:37,890 --> 01:07:39,760
我会动用我所有的权力
...I will use all the power I have.

663
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:45,400
抓到你  用最可怕的方式让你偿还
I will hunt you down and make you pay in a most hideous way for this.

664
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,030
我们得行动了
We have to move now.

665
01:07:56,210 --> 01:07:57,910
接电话  弗兰克  快接
Pick up,Frank. Pick up.

666
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:17,590
我在伊比沙岛度假
I'm in Ibiza. Making holiday.

667
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:25,170
有人递给我杯香槟
Someone hands me glass of champagne.

668
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:27,170
我喝了
I drink.

669
01:08:27,910 --> 01:08:30,380
然后觉得有点儿不舒服
Then I don't feel so good.

670
01:08:43,330 --> 01:08:46,450
我去了趟厕所  然后我醒来就在车上了
I go to bathroom,and next thing,I'm awake in the car.

671
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:51,460
我问他  "这是哪儿"  他说他只是个送货的
I ask him,"Where is this?" He tells me he's just a transporter.

672
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:57,700
他车开得很棒
He's pretty good driver.

673
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,800
当然没有你好
Not like you good.

674
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:07,710
我和他说  "求你了  我父亲是个有权有势的人
I tell him,"Please. My father a really powerful man.

675
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:12,290
很有影响力  认识很多人  让我给他打个电话吧"
Big influence. Knows a lot of people. Let me call him."

676
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:15,020
他害怕了  他以前从没做过
He's afraid. He's never done this before.

677
01:09:15,830 --> 01:09:20,390
这本来应该很简单  载人  离开  轻轻松松拿到钱
It's supposed to be simple. Pick up,drop off. Easy money.

678
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:23,930
有人告诉他  不能打电话  不能离开车
He's been told no calls,never leave car.

679
01:09:24,570 --> 01:09:26,300
但是我说服了他
But I convince him.

680
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:29,830
我打了电话
I call.

681
01:09:30,510 --> 01:09:32,740
但是我还没来得及和我父亲说我们在哪儿
But before I say to my father where we are...

682
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:34,240
快上车  快!
Inside the car. Come on!

683
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:42,580
我们逃脱了  但是…
We get away,but...

684
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:48,380
有人朝我们开枪  为什么?
There's people shooting at us. Why?

685
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:50,750
他们为什么要朝我们开枪?
Why they shooting at us?

686
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:55,860
他说他们开枪是因为我们没有按照计划行事
He says they shoot because we didn't go according to plan.

687
01:09:56,230 --> 01:10:00,690
我说  "好吧  那是个老计划  现在的新计划呢?"
I said,"Okay,that's the old plan. What's new plan?"

688
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:03,200
他说他有个朋友
He says he has a friend.

689
01:10:12,110 --> 01:10:14,410
接着就遇到了你
And then I met you.

690
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:19,880
见到你  我就觉得安全了
And then I feel it's gonna be okay.

691
01:10:24,490 --> 01:10:26,720
你甚至都不认识我
You didn't even know me.

692
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:28,860
我当然不认识你
Of course I don't know you.

693
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:32,560
我是在说感觉  不是认不认识
I talk about feelings,not knowing.

694
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:39,040
如果你有那种感觉  你表达的方式真是有趣
Well,if you was feeling that way,you sure had a funny way of showing it.

695
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:43,400
对女人来说  有点神秘感会更好
Better for a woman to have a little mystery to her.

696
01:10:43,610 --> 01:10:45,080
不是吗?
No?

697
01:10:46,650 --> 01:10:48,140
不是
No.

698
01:10:48,650 --> 01:10:51,950
没错  只是一点点
Yes. Just a little.

699
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:20,540
回到雷达监控上了  先生
He's back on the radar,sir.

700
01:11:25,590 --> 01:11:27,490
-喂  -你到底在哪儿?
-Yeah.  -Where the hell are you?

701
01:11:27,690 --> 01:11:28,880
在去布加勒斯特的路上
On the way to Bucharest.

702
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:30,620
地点换了
Not any longer.

703
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:36,290
新坐标：3-7-13
New coordinates: 3-7-13.

704
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:16,000
打扰一下  部长先生
Excuse me,Mr. Minister.

705
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:18,830
对不起  就一分钟
Sorry,just a minute.

706
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:21,130
我是塔可尼督察  来自马赛
Inspector Tarconi,from Marseilles.

707
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:25,010
额  准确来说  也不是马赛
Well,not exactly Marseilles...

708
01:12:25,210 --> 01:12:28,150
-是马赛东面的一个小镇  -你想说什么  督察?
-...but a small town to the east... -What do you want,inspector?

709
01:12:28,350 --> 01:12:30,010
-和你谈谈  -我没时间
-A word with you.  -I have no time.

710
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:32,490
是关于您女儿的
It's about your daughter.

711
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:44,360
敖德萨  弗兰克  我的故乡
Odessa,Frank. My country.

712
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:48,130
你带我回家了  谢谢你
You take me home. Thank you.

713
01:12:50,210 --> 01:12:52,110
怎么不去布加勒斯特了?
What happened to Bucharest?

714
01:12:53,710 --> 01:12:58,540
-计划变了  -变得好  我更喜欢敖德萨
-Change of plans.  -It's a good change. I prefer Odessa.

715
01:12:59,210 --> 01:13:00,810
是嘛
Yeah.

716
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:04,880
我倒是期待着鱼和胡萝卜
I was looking forward to that fish with the carrots myself.

717
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:07,080
哦  这儿会更好的
Oh,it's much better here.

718
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:10,380
-你知道基辅鸡吗?  -当然
-You know chicken Kiev?  -I do.

719
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:12,790
我知道这儿有家餐馆
I know restaurant here.

720
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,330
是世界上最棒的
Best in the world.

721
01:13:14,530 --> 01:13:18,860
鸡肉鲜美  当黄油溢出来的时候
The chicken's so fresh. And the butter,when it's coming out...

722
01:13:19,070 --> 01:13:21,200
你不敢相信  美味极了
Like you cannot believe,it's so nice.

723
01:13:26,910 --> 01:13:29,340
你知道我现在是什么感觉吗?
You know what I feel like now?

724
01:13:32,010 --> 01:13:33,680
饿的感觉
Hungry.

725
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:38,550
安全感
Safe.

726
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:51,030
这会像电影的结局那样  从此过着幸福快乐的生活吗?
It's going to end up like the movies,this happily ever after?

727
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:57,330
今晚  这一切都将成为回忆
By tonight,this is all gonna be a fading memory.

728
01:13:57,810 --> 01:14:01,800
结局是你和我会在基辅鸡店里坐着笑着
It's gonna be you and me,laughing over chicken Kiev.

729
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,440
骗子
Liar.

730
01:14:23,570 --> 01:14:25,660
部长先生  改主意了
Mr. Minister,an update,please.

731
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:31,810
一旦跟我女儿通过话  我就会签合同
I am ready to sign the contract once I speak to my daughter.

732
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:36,510
喂?  喂?
Hello? Hello?

733
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:39,710
准备好笔  我会再电话你的
Have that pen ready. I'll call you back.

734
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,520
-喂  -我们要收网了  弗兰克
-Yeah.  -We are closing the noose,Frank.

735
01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:54,460
好的  收网的时候  确保没人把我拖下车
Well,when it closes,make sure no one tries to drag me out of the car.

736
01:14:54,660 --> 01:14:56,190
你现在知道这是怎么回事了吗?
You know what this is about yet?

737
01:14:57,430 --> 01:14:59,920
这个女孩  她的父亲
The girl. Her father.

738
01:15:00,270 --> 01:15:02,790
和大量的有毒废料有关
Large amounts of toxic waste.

739
01:15:03,010 --> 01:15:05,340
这是场交易  他的签字换他女儿的命
It is a trade. His signature for her life.

740
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:10,140
我会用我的信誉保证保护她  长官
I have a reputation to uphold here,inspector.

741
01:15:10,350 --> 01:15:13,580
完成送货率是100%
One hundred percent successful delivery rate.

742
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:17,240
我好像听出来有点儿什么苗头?
Am I detecting a little attachment?

743
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:23,020
这不是我认识的弗兰克  他有他的规则  不问名字  不牵扯感情
That is not the Frank I know. With his rules,no names,no attachment.

744
01:15:23,230 --> 01:15:25,420
为什么每个人都对我的规则那么感兴趣?
Why is everyone so concerned about my rules?

745
01:15:26,130 --> 01:15:31,730
弗兰克  我一直怀疑  其实你的内心是浪漫的
Frank,I always suspected you are a romantic at heart.

746
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:34,690
还有别的事吗?
Anything else?

747
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:37,570
目的地在哪儿?
Where is the rendezvous?

748
01:15:37,770 --> 01:15:39,710
我会再打给你的
I'll call you back.

749
01:15:44,450 --> 01:15:47,070
-喂  -快结束了  弗兰克
-Yeah.  -We're almost at the end,Frank.

750
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:49,840
-把坐标给我  -没坐标了
-Just give me the coordinates.  -No more coordinates.

751
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:52,540
就在你现在的路上
The road you're on.

752
01:15:52,890 --> 01:15:54,220
第一个路口左拐
Make your first left.

753
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:56,510
我想要知道具体到哪儿
I'd like to know where I'm going.

754
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:03,760
到那儿你就知道了
You'll know when you get there.

755
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:36,060
别担心  这地方正是我们想带他们来的
Don't worry. We got them right where we want them.

756
01:16:43,010 --> 01:16:44,970
恭喜你  弗兰克
My compliments,Frank.

757
01:16:45,170 --> 01:16:48,800
你的能力果然值得我们信任
Our trust in your abilities was well deserved.

758
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:51,140
现在你可以请那女孩出来了
Now if you could please send the girl out.

759
01:16:52,850 --> 01:16:54,340
她马上出去
She's coming.

760
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:56,810
我不出去
I'm not coming.

761
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,650
他们需要你  他们不会杀你的
They need you. They won't kill you.

762
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:02,190
但是他们会杀了你
But they will kill you.

763
01:17:02,690 --> 01:17:05,960
我像是穿越半个欧洲而死在桥上的人吗?
Do I look like a man who came halfway across Europe to die on a bridge?

764
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:09,190
像吗?
Do I?

765
01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:20,940
我们没一整天可耗  弗兰克
We don't have all day,Frank.

766
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:26,340
看他们有很多人
Look how many of them.

767
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:28,480
都带着抢
They have all the guns.

768
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:29,840
怎么可能会没事?
How it's gonna be okay?

769
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:35,320
吃晚饭的时候告诉你
Tell you over dinner.

770
01:17:36,990 --> 01:17:38,190
现在去吧
Now,go.

771
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:40,390
走
Go.

772
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:42,320
吻我
Kiss me.

773
01:17:59,210 --> 01:18:00,700
走
Go.

774
01:18:05,590 --> 01:18:08,150
你会害死我的  快走
You're gonna get me killed. Now,go.

775
01:18:32,850 --> 01:18:35,040
抓她  你这混蛋
Get to her,you bastard.

776
01:19:00,410 --> 01:19:02,470
好点了吗  亲爱的?
Better now,darling?

777
01:19:20,930 --> 01:19:22,420
把他干了
Finish him.

778
01:19:41,950 --> 01:19:44,250
不!  弗兰克!
No! Frank!

779
01:19:55,530 --> 01:19:58,020
他的爱车将成为他的坟墓
His beloved car will be his grave.

780
01:19:58,230 --> 01:20:01,100
出来他会炸死  呆着他会淹死  我们撤吧
Leaves it,he blows. Stays,he drowns. Let's get out of here.

781
01:20:12,350 --> 01:20:14,340
-塔可尼  -女孩在他们手里
-Tarconi.  -They have the girl.

782
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:19,050
弗兰克  我们正通过电话信号找他的位置
Frank,we are trying to track him through the phone signal.

783
01:20:19,250 --> 01:20:21,480
-你在哪儿?  -湖里
-Where are you?  -In a lake.

784
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:24,350
湖?
A lake?

785
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:26,730
能再具体点吗?
Can you be more specific?

786
01:20:26,930 --> 01:20:28,190
有个水坝
There's a dam.

787
01:20:29,870 --> 01:20:31,800
-水坝?  -我知道那地方  先生
-A dam?  -I know the place,sir.

788
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,800
-多远?  -至少10分钟
-How far?  -Ten minutes at least.

789
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:35,870
弗兰克  我们将在10分钟内到
Frank,we'll be there in 10 minutes.

790
01:20:36,070 --> 01:20:37,370
能再快点吗?
Can you make it any faster?

791
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:40,140
-我们尽力  -谢谢
-We'll do our best.  -Thank you.

792
01:22:38,590 --> 01:22:40,080
买所有人的票
Buy tickets for all of us.

793
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:42,090
到哪儿?
Where to?

794
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:46,230
不管到哪儿  这半个小时我们得一直移动
Anywhere this train is going. We need to keep moving for half an hour.

795
01:22:46,430 --> 01:22:48,370
为什么不开车绕圈呢?
Why don't we just keep driving around?

796
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:55,410
这账改天再算
Another day.

797
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:12,420
先生!  在那儿!
Sir! There!

798
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:33,770
-出去  出去!  -所有人都出去!
-Out. Out!  -Everybody out!

799
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:35,410
-快  -出去!
-Come on.  -Move!

800
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:37,710
出去  快!
Move,quick!

801
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:57,370
-部长先生?  -喂
-Mr. Minister?  -Yes.

802
01:23:58,010 --> 01:23:59,700
有人想和你通话
Someone wants to talk to you.

803
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:03,700
-爸爸  -你还好吗?
-Papa.  -Are you all right?

804
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:09,940
不要签
Don't sign.

805
01:24:10,650 --> 01:24:13,710
你还有15分钟的时间
What you have is 15 minutes.

806
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,690
-查出这究竟是怎么回事了吗?  -垃圾
-You ever find out what this is about?  -Garbage.

807
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:25,420
我们现在谈的是多少垃圾?
How much garbage are we talking?

808
01:24:26,370 --> 01:24:29,930
足够污染半个国家一百年的垃圾
Enough to pollute half the country for a hundred years.

809
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:31,130
再试一次
Try it again.

810
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:55,190
作为一个现代女性  你相当无知
For a modern woman,you are very uninformed.

811
01:24:55,460 --> 01:24:57,120
这是个新世界
This is the new world.

812
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:00,560
不再有什么国家  那是旧想法了
There are no more countries. That's old think.

813
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,370
只有现实的经济效益  利益和损失
There are just economic realities. Profit and loss.

814
01:25:04,570 --> 01:25:07,300
高效和浪费
Efficiency and waste.

815
01:25:07,510 --> 01:25:09,500
要考虑全球  而不是地方
Think global,not local.

816
01:25:10,310 --> 01:25:12,250
去你妈的
Think this.

817
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:29,030
-喂?  -进展如何?
-Yes?  -Where are we?

818
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:38,130
就快完事了
We're almost there.

819
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:42,140
在哪儿?
Where?

820
01:25:42,340 --> 01:25:44,370
这儿  他在一辆火车上
Here. He is on a train.

821
01:25:45,010 --> 01:25:47,350
-我们呢?  -这儿
-And where are we?  -Here.

822
01:25:47,550 --> 01:25:49,740
我们可以在那儿跟火车接头
We can get units there.

823
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:53,220
这主意不错  就这么办
That's a good idea. Do that.

824
01:25:57,190 --> 01:26:00,030
哦  弗兰克  拜托
Oh,Frank,come on.

825
01:26:31,930 --> 01:26:34,490
部长先生  我向您保证  一切都合乎程序
Mr. Minister,I assure you,everything is in order.

826
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:36,560
我相信
I'm sure it is.

827
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:40,830
-如果出了什么问题  -我知道你们会解决的
-If there are any problems... -I know you will solve them.

828
01:26:41,770 --> 01:26:43,670
现在  让我一个人
Now,if you don't mind...

829
01:27:14,070 --> 01:27:17,600
也许你不相信  但是我的内心其实是和平主义者
You might not believe this,but I am,at heart,a pacifist.

830
01:27:18,870 --> 01:27:20,930
我讨厌暴力
I hate violence.

831
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:25,740
暴力造成的问题比解决的还多
It creates more problems than it solves.

832
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:30,220
你知道  这并非我所愿
You know,I never wanted to do any of this.

833
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:34,780
一个客户问我要结果
A client asked me to obtain a result...

834
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:37,350
所以我想用最少的流血
...so I went about creating an environment...

835
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:39,320
获得他想要的结果
...with the least amount of bloodshed.

836
01:27:39,530 --> 01:27:42,260
没人想合作  你不想  第一个司机不想
No one wanted to cooperate. Not you,not the first driver...

837
01:27:42,460 --> 01:27:46,230
你父亲不想  刚死的弗兰克·马丁也不想
...not your father,not the recently deceased Frank Martin.

838
01:27:47,370 --> 01:27:49,930
每个人都想打架
Everyone wanted to fight.

839
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:06,510
有什么好笑的吗?
What's so funny?

840
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:10,250
听一个死人说话
Hearing a dead man talking.

841
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:25,060
再走一步  弗兰克
One more step,Frank.

842
01:30:25,490 --> 01:30:27,020
来啊  再走一步啊
Come on. One more.

843
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:12,070
看
Look.

844
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:13,460
结束了
It's over.

845
01:31:14,380 --> 01:31:16,040
8:58了  他签了
Two minutes to 9. He signed.

846
01:31:19,850 --> 01:31:21,940
哦  我的天
Oh,my God.

847
01:31:27,220 --> 01:31:28,650
不  弗兰克  不  不
No,Frank. No,no.

848
01:32:09,660 --> 01:32:12,100
结束了  弗兰克  结束了
It's over,Frank. It's over.

849
01:32:13,370 --> 01:32:15,840
任务完成  你和这女孩自由了
Mission accomplished. You and the girl are free to go.

850
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:19,770
事实上  你的才能给我留下深刻印象
Matter of fact,I'm so impressed by your talent...

851
01:32:19,970 --> 01:32:21,640
我可以给你提供一个职位
...I'd like to offer you a position.

852
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:25,140
我想给你提供一个  终身残废
I'd like to offer you one. Permanently disabled.

853
01:32:44,430 --> 01:32:45,760
我讨厌浪费人才
I hate to waste talent.

854
01:32:45,970 --> 01:32:48,270
但是我们真的合不来
But I really don't think we'd make a very good fit.

855
01:32:48,470 --> 01:32:49,960
没错
That's right.

856
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:14,850
不!
No!

857
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:21,960
我们是合不来  不过你和这手镯很般配
We wouldn't fit,but you and the bracelet were made for each other.

858
01:33:26,540 --> 01:33:27,800
不  不
No,no.

859
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:40,140
不!
No!

860
01:33:41,790 --> 01:33:43,020
不!
No!

861
01:33:58,740 --> 01:34:00,600
您是在做件正确的事
You're doing the right thing.

862
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:22,190
瓦伦蒂娜
Valentina.

863
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:28,560
瓦伦蒂娜
Valentina.

864
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:41,010
我是在天堂吗?
Am I in heaven?

865
01:34:44,150 --> 01:34:46,420
我们更像是在地狱
Looks more like we're in hell.

866
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:48,720
我不在乎
I don't care.

867
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:50,720
只要我们能在一起
As long as we're there together.

868
01:35:03,070 --> 01:35:04,130
喂?
Yes?

869
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:07,500
部长先生  您的女儿在我们这儿了
Mr. Minister,your daughter is in good hands.

870
01:35:09,010 --> 01:35:10,600
谢谢
Thank you.

871
01:35:25,130 --> 01:35:27,530
-你在干嘛?  -就像你说的  做正确的事
-What are you doing?  -What you said,the right thing.

872
01:35:27,730 --> 01:35:30,960
现在  先生们  请见谅  我还有个会要发表演讲
And now,gentlemen. if you'll excuse me,I have a conference to address...

873
01:35:31,170 --> 01:35:34,100
是关于与你们这样的人做生意的危险性
...on the dangers of doing business with people like you.

874
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:35,290
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

875
01:35:54,490 --> 01:35:55,510
船准备好了吗?
Is the launch ready?

876
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:58,060
-在水上  先生  随时待命  -该走了
-It's on the water,sir,waiting.  -Time to leave.

877
01:35:58,790 --> 01:36:00,120
-带上航海日志  -是
-Grab the log.  -Okay.

878
01:36:19,250 --> 01:36:22,110
我只是不明白
I just don't understand it.

879
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:24,280
当我还是小男孩的时候  我和我父亲
When I was a boy,my father and I...

880
01:36:24,490 --> 01:36:27,820
一天总能从这儿钓到鱼
...used to pull fish out of this very spot all day long.

881
01:36:28,020 --> 01:36:29,650
时代变了  长官
Times change,inspector.

882
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:31,990
人也一样
As do people.

883
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,930
你说我?
You referring to me?

884
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:40,590
我认为这话不对
I don't think that's a very accurate statement.

885
01:36:41,540 --> 01:36:43,770
我还在开同样的车  住同样的房子
I drive the same car,live in the same house.

886
01:36:43,970 --> 01:36:48,100
哦  我不是指你的车子和房子
Oh,I was not referring to your car or your house.

887
01:36:50,980 --> 01:36:53,340
大海真宁静啊
The sea is so restful.

888
01:36:53,550 --> 01:36:54,710
午饭准备好了吗?
Is lunch ready yet?

889
01:36:55,980 --> 01:36:59,280
小姐  事情总有先后次序
Mademoiselle,there is a certain progression to things.

890
01:36:59,490 --> 01:37:02,820
要吃午饭  你得先抓到午饭
In order to eat the lunch,you first have to catch the lunch.

891
01:37:03,020 --> 01:37:05,250
如果我们继续讨论而不集中注意力的话
And if we keep talking instead of concentrating...

892
01:37:05,460 --> 01:37:06,790
我们就什么都钓不到
...we're gonna catch nothing.

893
01:37:06,990 --> 01:37:10,730
我有个更好的主意  为什么我们不跳过抓午饭这一步
I have better idea. Why we don't skip catching of lunch...

894
01:37:10,930 --> 01:37:12,870
直接去吃午饭呢?
...and go right to eating of lunch?

895
01:37:13,070 --> 01:37:16,230
我知道离这儿不远有个很棒的地方
I know wonderful place just up coast from here...

896
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:19,340
他们炖的鱼超级好吃
...where they make fish stew. Incredible.

897
01:37:19,540 --> 01:37:25,310
他们用番茄和洋葱做作料  加上一点野生薰衣草
They use tomatoes and onions,and little amount of wild lavender.

898
01:37:26,010 --> 01:37:27,910
有什么样的葡萄酒?
What kind of wine?

899
01:37:28,120 --> 01:37:29,840
粉红的  来自南方的酒
Pink. From south.

900
01:37:31,150 --> 01:37:32,980
也许是教皇新堡酒
A Chateauneuf,perhaps.

901
01:37:33,450 --> 01:37:35,890
-冰的  -当然是冰的
-Chilled.  -Of course,chilled.

902
01:37:36,090 --> 01:37:38,020
甜点呢?
And for dessert?
