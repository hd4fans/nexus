1
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,460
Ninety-one,Ninety-two...

2
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,130
It's down there.  Where? If they catch us...

3
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,300
There's a million bottles of booze in there.

4
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,990
You think they're gonna miss one?

5
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,350
Weather is with us,sir.

6
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,920
We arrive in port in a couple of hours.

7
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,690
Very good.

8
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,660
You're welcome,sir.

9
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,670
Man,I never smelt anything like this. Not even when you're in the crapper.

10
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,100
Oh,what,your shit smells like roses?

11
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,610
Hey,look.

12
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,580
I'll give you a hand.

13
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,280
Thought you said it was booze.  That's what the papers said.

14
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,460
Captain,we have a breach in lower level. Look.

15
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,220
Which section?  101.

16
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,400
Fuck. Take the wheel.

17
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes,sir.  Fuck.

18
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,270
Close the door! Get the masks.

19
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,640
Holy shit.

20
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,310
Take care of them.

21
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,490
Morning.  Passport,please.

22
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,160
Rough seas?

23
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,040
The sea was smooth. The party was a bit rough,if you know what I mean.

24
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,770
Ibiza.  Yeah.

25
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,410
Thanks.

26
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,820
When I was a kid,my father used to take me fishing.

27
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,260
Never could figure out how he knew where the fish were.

28
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,830
They were always exactly where he said they would be.

29
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,990
Security check.

30
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,990
Do I look like a security risk?

31
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,320
Please step out of the car and bring your documents to the office.

32
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,760
My documents are right here,sir.

33
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,100
The computer is in the office.

34
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,830
Her too.

35
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,700
She's sleeping.

36
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,670
With her documents.  Okay,sure.

37
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,720
Come on. You're gonna lose it.

38
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,930
Close,inspector,you're close.

39
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,740
That's a big one. Go left,go left.

40
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,110
Don't let him get away.

41
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,040
You're close.

42
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,910
Go left,go left! Go right!

43
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,820
Must be Moby Dick you hooked. Need some help?

44
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,090
No,thank you,Frank.

45
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,660
I have been fishing these waters since before you were born.

46
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,440
You were close,inspector. You were close.

47
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,680
Good thing that we French have such a highly developed sense of humor.

48
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,420
With all due respect,the French think Jerry Lewis is a genius.

49
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,750
Jerry Lewis is a genius.  Dean was the genius.

50
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,020
No,Dean just stood there with a drink and a cigarette.

51
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:06,200
My point exactly. Anyone can fall down and get a laugh.

52
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,630
How many people can do it standing still with a drink and a cigarette?

53
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:24,380
I am afraid our day of leisure is cut short.

54
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,050
There is a big mess in Marseilles.

55
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,120
Some madman driving an Audi at impossible speeds.

56
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,590
Don't look at me.

57
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:36,660
That is the first place the chief told me to look.

58
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:41,030
But I will tell him you have the perfect alibi.

59
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,430
As usual.

60
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,340
Tarconi!

61
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,150
Please!  I am sorry,Frank.

62
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:57,440
It's our first bite!  Yeah,yeah.

63
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,050
Please.  Yeah.

64
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,720
Stop the boat. Come on.

65
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,650
No. No,Frank.  Come on,please.

66
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,460
Purpose of your visit,Mr. Johnson?

67
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,220
Business.

68
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,030
What kind of business?

69
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,440
Environmental protection.

70
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,440
Thank you.

71
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:08,120
Mr. Minister,you're giving the opening address at an EU conference...

72
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,050
on environmental impact of industry in Odessa tomorrow.

73
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,990
What is top on your list of priorities?  It's a short list.

74
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,920
There's only one item: The environment and how to protect it.

75
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,930
In the face of increasing pressure...

76
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:22,070
for industries to compete successfully in a global economy...

77
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,600
that goal can sometimes come up against some very harsh realities.

78
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,770
Well,not as harsh as a polluted and uninhabitable planet.

79
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,670
Gentlemen,if you'll excuse me now...

80
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,070
I have trees to save and industrialists to disappoint.

81
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,980
Your speech for tomorrow.  Any good?

82
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,390
It's going to piss off a lot of people.  Excellent.

83
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,500
Hello?

84
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,480
Mr. Minister?

85
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,510
Who is this?

86
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,220
My name is not important.

87
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,650
I've been put in charge of the negotiations...

88
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,260
you are engaged in with Ecocorp...

89
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,730
for issuance of their license to do business in the Ukraine.

90
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,400
You must be misinformed,Mr. Whatever-Your-Name-Is.

91
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,660
I've terminated negotiations permanently.

92
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,270
I think you will reconsider that position...

93
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,870
once you have a chance to study the documents in the envelope.

94
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,760
I'll be in touch.

95
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,360
Yeah,there's been an accident.

96
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,070
Send an ambulance,8 Route de la Falaise.

97
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,890
Malcolm.

98
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,750
Malcolm. Malcolm.

99
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,330
I asked you for your price. What is this?

100
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:14,600
A man who might be interested in taking the job. This man will.

101
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,970
My boss said you're the man for the job.

102
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,840
Your boss got his facts wrong.

103
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,240
Two things you should know about my boss:

104
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:26,680
He never gets his facts wrong,he never takes no for an answer.

105
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,910
Well,there's a first time for everything.

106
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,620
Well,not this time.

107
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,930
You don't wanna do this.

108
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:53,080
I don't think you're in a position to tell me what I do and don't wanna do.

109
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,250
You have 10 seconds to change your mind.

110
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:04,020
I'll give you five seconds to remove your hand.

111
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,010
Malcolm. Malcolm.

112
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,210
You hear me?

113
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,220
Mal,I said drop in anytime,but I didn't mean...

114
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:15,290
Nowhere else to go.  Just take it easy,okay?

115
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,220
Don't move me from the car.

116
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:22,390
It's just get you comfortable till the ambulance arrives.  No ambulance.

117
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:26,200
You need a doctor,you've been shot. I can't take care of this.

118
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,580
Not far from car.

119
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,140
Relax.

120
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:38,140
Just try to stay calm. We'll have you fixed up in no time.

121
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,190
He's inside. Quick,it's serious.

122
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:56,760
Sir?

123
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:00,170
You wanna be careful moving him.  We know our job,okay?

124
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,860
Sir,can you hear me?

125
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,600
This car No...

126
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,330
If you hear me,press my hand.

127
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,080
The car...

128
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,230
Am I in heaven?

129
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,900
Actually,you're in a bit of the shit.

130
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:06,060
You'll help me out of it?

131
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,500
That depends on how deep you're in.

132
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:12,000
Don't trust anyone.  Couldn't agree with you more.

133
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,800
Come on.  No! Don't leave the car!

134
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:19,180
What's so special about the car?  Not the car.

135
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,160
Wait!

136
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,950
I told you.

137
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,860
Don't trust anyone.

138
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,960
I told you.

139
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,620
I took the liberty of bringing your suit.

140
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,990
It's what you wear when you're working,correct?

141
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,860
Correct. But I'm not working.

142
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,490
You see,boss? I told you.  Please,Joseph.

143
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,160
Your approach was not very effective in presenting our proposal the first time.

144
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,930
Thank you.

145
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:24,600
As I was saying...

146
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:27,940
we came to you in good faith. You said you were unavailable.

147
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,580
We contracted with the man whose number you gave us.

148
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,310
He proved to be ineffective.

149
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,780
And now I am left with unfinished business.

150
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,290
The way I see it,you're responsible.

151
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,820
I understand your point of view.

152
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,220
But I'm still unavailable.

153
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,700
Boss,can I say something?

154
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,760
Anyone else wanna say something?

155
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,430
Good.

156
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,730
Find me a smarter one.

157
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,100
You have three seconds to change your mind...

158
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:05,080
or you're gonna be permanently unavailable.

159
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,280
One.

160
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,540
Two.

161
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,850
One condition.

162
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,490
I'm listening.

163
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,390
I drive my own car.

164
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,170
Deal.

165
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:31,870
In anticipation of your answer,we took the liberty of bringing your car.

166
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,010
Changed the oil,gave it a tune-up,took out all the non-essential material.

167
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,740
Left the switch-over license plates. Love that.

168
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,220
Replaced the GPS with one of our own.

169
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,290
Preprogrammed. More efficient that way.

170
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,720
Why I was so insistent on using only the best man for this assignment?

171
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,900
We're playing in a much larger game here.

172
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,760
Don't think of this as just another job. Think of it as a mission.

173
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:03,640
I'm so pleased to find we share the same approach to our work.

174
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,900
I make a deal,that's the deal. Just like you.

175
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,840
You don't like names. Neither do I. We're both precise.

176
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:12,140
Neither one of us has any interest in what we're paid to do...

177
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:16,310
beyond what we are paid to do. Those are your rules,right?

178
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,120
You forgot one.

179
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:29,630
I work alone.  I thought you might like the company.

180
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,400
Thought you wanted me to complete a mission.

181
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,440
You're right. I do.

182
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,410
Wait.

183
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:44,250
What,you wanna change the rules?

184
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,620
Every rule has an exception. Let's make one for today.

185
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,020
You're the boss.

186
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,790
Anything else?

187
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,260
The jewelry. Anything I should know?

188
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,560
You remember those jokers trying to blow up airliners...

189
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,600
by sneaking liquids through and combining them onboard?

190
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,710
Same principle,just refined.

191
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,610
Twenty-five feet from the car...

192
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:17,210
yellow light comes on,signaling the first liquid is ready.

193
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,210
Fifty feet,orange.

194
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,750
Second liquid flows into the chamber.

195
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,920
Seventy-five feet,you're gonna see red.

196
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,930
Time to go.

197
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:36,130
This phone is programmed to call only one number,mine.

198
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,070
When you pass the first toll on the road going north,call me,all right?

199
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:45,140
Money for gas and food.

200
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,540
Any other questions?

201
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,340
Would you mind buckling your seat belt?

202
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,420
Don't suppose you wanna tell me what this is all about?

203
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,130
Great.

204
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:00,410
Ocean Pearl requesting cargo clearance.

205
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,610
The papers are with the environmental agency.

206
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,920
Drop anchor and wait to dock.

207
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:09,750
We'll inform you when they're signed.  Okay.

208
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,030
I know what happened to you.

209
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,470
But what happened to Frank?

210
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:33,310
Colonel Medved over at Intelligence has been given all the information.

211
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,320
He knows it's top priority.

212
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,080
He wants you to know he has his best men on it.

213
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,450
He'll keep it out of official channels.

214
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:44,320
He suggests you buy as much time as you can.

215
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:44,480
Look,I don't know what your part in all this is or isn't. And I don't really care.

216
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,990
You were here first,you know more than I do...

217
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,890
download me on what you know.

218
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,650
I know nothing.

219
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,060
How did you know Malcolm?

220
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,490
I didn't.

221
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,930
You just happened to end up in a car with a man you don't know?

222
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:02,200
I'm now in a car with man I don't know.

223
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,700
Aren't you supposed to make a call?

224
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,550
Nice to hear from you.

225
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:17,810
You can skip the pleasantries. Just give me the code.

226
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,780
1-1-2-6.

227
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:26,430
Call me when you arrive.

228
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,600
What's in Budapest?

229
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,070
Goulash. Beer.

230
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,310
All right.

231
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:44,310
Let's rewind here,start with the proper introductions.

232
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:47,470
What happened to the rule of no names?

233
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:50,750
I'm suspending that rule for the moment.

234
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:56,020
I'm Frank Martin.

235
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,760
And your name is?

236
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:05,330
What matters,my name?

237
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,840
Well,we're in this situation together.

238
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:10,930
No.

239
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:17,340
We're sitting here with two exploding bracelets on,going to the same place.

240
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,450
I'd call that being in the same situation.

241
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,480
It's not. They are going to kill you.

242
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,480
I'm aware of that.

243
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,450
In all probability,after they kill me,you're next on the list.

244
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:35,190
Now,if I'm gonna keep that from happening,I'm gonna need a little help.

245
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,030
From the top. We have this problem.

246
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,200
You think I don't know it's a problem?

247
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,540
I look stupid to you?

248
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,730
I didn't say you were stupid.

249
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,840
But we have a problem

250
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:52,710
and you're not being very helpful in participating in the solution of it.

251
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:56,650
I don't want to talk anymore.

252
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,290
Fine.

253
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,410
What did you say your name was?

254
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:24,350
Frank. Frank Martin.

255
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,480
Frank Martin.

256
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,880
Valentina.

257
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,450
Pleased to meet you.

258
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:33,610
The gentlemen from Ecocorp are here.

259
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,250
Show them in.

260
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,050
Gentlemen.

261
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:49,860
Mr. Minister.

262
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:52,940
We'd like to thank you for reconsidering our proposal

263
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:56,070
on such short notice.  You make it very hard not to.

264
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:59,900
Well,yes. We do have a reputation of not taking no for an answer.

265
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,310
Here are the contracts.

266
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,240
All in order.

267
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,110
We were told the ships couldn't be cleared

268
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,310
unless you personally signed off on them.

269
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,850
Ships?

270
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,860
I thought there was only one.

271
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,530
Oh,well,here's the thing.

272
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:19,460
In order to make the venture more profitable

273
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,630
we need to process the material in a volume that makes sense.

274
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,460
How many ships are we talking about?

275
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:28,440
Plus the one in the port waiting on clearance,eight.

276
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,270
Eight.

277
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,800
This year.

278
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,100
Protecting the environment is a long-term commitment.

279
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,310
You've said so yourself,haven't you?

280
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,040
And I will do again tomorrow in Odessa

281
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:44,120
where I will sign these.

282
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:47,850
We were really hoping to settle this today.

283
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:52,430
I want to review them,now that there are some addendums.

284
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,790
Twenty-four hours doesn't make a difference

285
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,370
on such a long-term commitment,will it?

286
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,830
No,of course not.

287
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:05,030
Then I will see you tomorrow in Odessa. Let's say 9 a.m.

288
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,310
Yes.

289
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,250
Okay,I'll stay.

290
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,080
But the material is leaking everywhere.  And?

291
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:18,850
We won't be able to hide it.  I'll take care of it,just give me some time.

292
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,350
If ever they check...

293
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,860
Easy. The deal will be closed very soon.

294
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,690
Twenty-four hours. No more.

295
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:37,570
Yes?  I've bought you another 24 hours.

296
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:40,070
You have until tomorrow,9 a.m.

297
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,110
That should be more than enough time.

298
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,550
Do you have a lead?

299
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,550
Better than a lead.

300
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:48,370
A location.

301
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,930
I'm hungry.

302
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,450
We're 100 kilometers from beer and sausage.

303
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:36,330
I don't like sausage.

304
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,070
What would you like?

305
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,870
Veal.

306
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,010
Roast,with carrots...

307
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,610
and beets.

308
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:55,240
In gravy,with Madeira in stock.

309
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,720
Nothing to start?

310
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:02,260
A salad.

311
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:06,130
Greens tossed with balsamic.

312
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:08,090
From Modena.

313
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,700
Aged?

314
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,870
Of course,aged.

315
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,900
And for dessert?

316
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,770
Sachertorte.

317
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,800
With whipped cream or without?

318
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,510
With.

319
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,150
To drink?

320
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:31,280
Wine.

321
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,290
Tokaj,perhaps?

322
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:34,880
Ice wine.

323
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,860
Of course.

324
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:52,570
What are you doing?   Seeing a man about some jewelry.

325
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,810
He's gone off the reservation.

326
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:11,490
Send someone to get him back on.

327
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,060
Don't kill him.

328
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:43,420
Frank. It's so good to see you,mein Freund.

329
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,030
Good to see you too,Otto.

330
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,890
You didn't mention you bring company.

331
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,560
It's not really company.

332
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,730
It's...

333
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,030
complicated.

334
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,210
With you,it's always complicated. But you can tell me about it...

335
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:02,140
over a nice schnitzel with Kartoffelsalat I have prepared.

336
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,940
Hey,Otto,you know I love your schnitzel

337
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:07,580
but we need to get rid of this first.

338
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,580
Binary free-form magnetic-resolution technology.

339
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,290
English,please,Otto.

340
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,750
There's a program the Pentagon has funded

341
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,060
through one of their subsidiary front companies

342
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:25,600
that's been experimenting with this new kind of weaponry

343
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,430
based on the theory of magnetic attraction.

344
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,660
Very hush-hush stuff.

345
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,240
I didn't realize you were in the loop on the Pentagon hush-hush.

346
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:37,470
You wouldn't believe what you can discover

347
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,840
when you left your fingers walking through the Internet.

348
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:42,280
You wanna see the invasion plans for Iran?

349
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,480
Maybe some other time.

350
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:48,130
Right now we need to get this thing off without blowing myself to Iran.

351
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:50,760
I don't wanna bother you with the details

352
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,490
but usually there's a transmitter plate close by.

353
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,170
You should not be doing this.

354
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,370
First you don't talk,now you offer advice.

355
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:08,040
Not advice. A warning.

356
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,370
Well,a little late for warnings,don't you think?

357
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,350
I agree with you.

358
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,520
You're off course.

359
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,260
Should I?   Yeah,you should.

360
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,830
Look,fellas

361
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,580
some things in the car were a bit off,needed checking.

362
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,320
In my profession,a man is only as good as the car he drives.

363
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,720
You take care of the car,the car will take care of you.

364
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:56,220
The boss says," Back on the road."

365
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,060
Frank?

366
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,850
Keep at it.

367
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,730
Back in the car,Frank.

368
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,630
No.

369
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,100
Find it?   Not yet.

370
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,450
You're the smart one?

371
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:40,250
No. I'm the big one.

372
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,740
Not so big anymore,are you?

373
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:58,160
Found it.

374
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:04,900
The transmitter.  Can you remove it?

375
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:08,400
It's wired.

376
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,740
If I do: it comes boom.

377
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,730
You fight good.

378
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,870
But your tie bad.

379
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,510
Where are you going?

380
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:24,820
Tired.

381
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,220
That's why I prefer to deal with cars.

382
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:30,750
That makes two of us.

383
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,260
What do you want me to do when they? When they wake up?

384
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:37,530
Probably best to take the rest of the day off.

385
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:57,010
I'm not amused.

386
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,090
You'd be less amused if you ended up dead.

387
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:01,690
If you wanted me dead,I'd be dead. You need me alive.

388
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:04,690
You want me to complete the job,I need some clarification.

389
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:07,420
I'm listening.

390
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,020
In person.

391
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,670
We've already done in person.

392
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:12,960
Well,not to my satisfaction,apparently.

393
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,610
Right now,my satisfaction should be your main concern.

394
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:20,230
Same place. One hour. Wait for my call.

395
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:18,190
Hello?

396
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,340
You've disappointed me.

397
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:23,600
You won't be the first and you won't be the last.

398
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:28,570
I told you I wanted to do this in person.  That won't be necessary. You see...

399
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,840
since our little chat at the beginning

400
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:34,540
I've been thinking I don't need the best for this mundane assignment.

401
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,910
Any idiot with a driver's license will do.

402
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:40,150
So in the words of the great American,Donald Trump:

403
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:43,690
I'm sorry,but you're fired.

404
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,060
Who are you?

405
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,070
Your new chauffeur.   I want the old one back.

406
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,610
He's about to go to pieces.

407
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,410
You're fired.

408
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:51,280
How was your nap?

409
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:54,060
Restful. How was your phone call?

410
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:56,730
Brief. Fasten your seat belt.

411
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,630
Tarconi.

412
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,860
It's me.

413
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,770
I was wondering when you would call.

414
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,170
I've been busy.

415
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:18,010
Let me guess. In Budapest?

416
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,610
You've been busy too.

417
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,950
Never a problem keeping that way with a friend like you,Frank.

418
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:26,990
So I don't have to be redundant,tell me what you know.

419
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:29,620
There is a black Mercedes also in Budapest.

420
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:31,890
Probably not occupied by friends of yours.

421
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,720
That is what I know. Now tell me what you know.

422
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:38,870
I have two bags in the back and a girl in the front.

423
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:40,970
Russian,I think.

424
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,370
I don't know what she has to do with anything.

425
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:45,540
Have you tried asking her?

426
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:47,800
Now,why didn't I think of that?  Sorry.

427
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:49,710
Of course you've asked. And she says?

428
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:51,640
I'm going to die.

429
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:54,150
Typical. Russians.

430
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:56,550
They are so dark.

431
00:46:56,750 --> 00:47:00,250
I remember,in school,reading Dostoyevsky and thinking

432
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:03,120
when do these people laugh?

433
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:04,990
One page after the other

434
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,160
misery and suffering like you wouldn't believe,Frank.

435
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:11,770
Inspector,can we save the literature lesson? I'm blinking here.

436
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:13,160
Is that code?

437
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:17,540
No,it's some bracelet they accessorized us with.

438
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:19,970
Wired to explode if we get too far from the car.

439
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:21,170
They?

440
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:22,900
Some American.

441
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:25,980
Can you be more specific? A name? A number?

442
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:27,210
Nothing.

443
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,610
Why do you always make it so easy,Frank?

444
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:31,520
It's my nature.

445
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,550
Where are you? I will come there.

446
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,230
That's not a good idea. They have me on a short leash.

447
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:39,260
I can't be of much help if you do not give me something.

448
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,020
How close are you to a computer?

449
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:47,960
Yes,Frank?

450
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:50,940
That wasn't very nice,back there in the market.

451
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:53,970
You were the one who broke the rules,not me.

452
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:56,240
Point well taken.

453
00:47:56,510 --> 00:48:00,040
That makes us even. What say we start with a clean slate?

454
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:03,380
So this call is about kiss-and-make-up,then?

455
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:05,080
More or less.

456
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:08,190
You have what I need to get the bracelet off...

457
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:11,220
I have the packages you need delivered.

458
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:14,790
Here are the new coordinates,then: 2-6-12.

459
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,670
That'll take you to the place...

460
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:19,170
where we can have a conclusion to this business.

461
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:21,100
I look forward to it.

462
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:28,410
Frank.

463
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:29,810
Did you get it?

464
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:36,750
Got the signal. Give us a little time...

465
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:39,180
and we should have his number and location.

466
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,290
Your new phone,sir.

467
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:51,130
Anything else?  No.

468
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,340
Frank,do you know where the signal is taking you?

469
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,850
I know restaurant there. Fish like you never had.

470
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:16,220
Roasted with small carrots and black pepper.

471
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:18,990
Romanian wine,not so good.

472
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:23,430
But for the last meal,could be worse.

473
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:29,200
You really should begin to think more positive.

474
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:31,770
I'm realist.

475
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:36,370
My friend was right when he said you were doom and gloom.

476
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:39,450
What means "doom and gloom"?

477
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:42,580
You know,you only see the horrible and the terrible.

478
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:45,760
Your friend,where does he get this? He doesn't know me.

479
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:49,250
He was talking about you in general. Russians,as a people.

480
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:51,590
I'm not Russian. I'm Ukrainian.

481
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,350
Excuse me.

482
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:57,620
Not excused. We're different people. We're different here...

483
00:49:57,830 --> 00:49:58,990
and here.

484
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:08,670
Me,personally,I think there's a little bit of an optimist in you.

485
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:12,650
How you can make such a statement? You don't know me.

486
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:16,980
Well,I see you're putting makeup on.

487
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:20,680
If you were so convinced we was gonna die,why bother?

488
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:26,660
What does looking good have to do with dying?

489
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,530
Hello.

490
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:37,700
What's that?

491
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:40,380
Souvenirs from Ibiza. Do you want one?

492
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,700
No,thank you. And neither do you. We need to stay sharp.

493
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,480
Okay.

494
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:54,080
You stay sharp.

495
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:57,160
I stay,how you say? Optimist?

496
00:50:57,630 --> 00:51:00,990
Give me that. Give me that thing. Give me the pill!

497
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:05,560
Give me that...

498
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:12,800
Jesus.

499
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,910
Great.

500
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:22,280
Just great.  Come on,Frank Martin,lighten up.

501
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:24,350
I should? How about when those pills hit?

502
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:27,180
You're gonna be lighting up like a goddamn Christmas tree.

503
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:28,450
That would be nice.

504
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:31,490
Boring. Boring. Boring?

505
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,630
Oh,yeah.

506
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,660
You should stay in the car.

507
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,340
You want me to pee in car?

508
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,810
Okay. Go on.

509
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,080
You remember.

510
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:57,110
Don't.

511
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:19,860
Don't.

512
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:22,290
Don't.

513
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:43,980
Oh,no.

514
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:25,690
Stop,all right?  Why? I don't drive.

515
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:27,130
I want to have fun.

516
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:30,670
I want to be happy. You should try happy instead of so serious.

517
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:34,030
It's important to stay positive,like you say,yeah?

518
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,440
Drink with me,Frankie.  I don't want a drink.

519
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:42,710
Now who is all gloomy and doomy?

520
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,850
I say it right? Gloomy doomy?

521
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:48,020
Come on,get in the car.

522
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:51,180
I am free,like a bird.

523
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,970
The girl! Come on! Faster!

524
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:12,340
I have lost my friend!  I'll buy you a new one.

525
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:28,720
Have any idea why we have a car on our ass?

526
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:31,430
I don't know. I don't care.

527
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:36,170
You mind?  First you say I'm doom and gloom...

528
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:39,210
and now you tell me do not be happy? Make up your mind.

529
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:31,360
Yes,Frank?  I thought we had an agreement.

530
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:32,790
We do.

531
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:34,890
It had nothing to do with a car on my ass.

532
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:40,970
I don't have anything to do with that. Someone else has issues with you?

533
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:42,970
Likely.

534
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:49,080
What I think is that there are other forces at work here.

535
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,680
Let me check into it,see what I can find out.

536
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,470
What do I do in the meantime?

537
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,840
Drive faster.

538
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,620
What the hell is he doing?

539
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:36,410
There!

540
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:38,020
He's down there!

541
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:44,890
I'm hungry.

542
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:47,260
Should have thought about a sandwich,not vodka.

543
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:50,560
Look!

544
00:58:56,970 --> 00:58:59,100
I wasn't hungry then,I was thirsty.

545
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:00,970
Why you are so mean to me?

546
00:59:02,310 --> 00:59:05,470
I'm not being mean. I'm preoccupied.  What means "preoccupied"?

547
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:12,710
That means preoccupied.

548
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:26,440
Shoot the tires! Come on! Get him!

549
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:30,830
Get down!  Shoot him!

550
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:42,850
Bloody hell!

551
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:54,120
Faster!

552
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:02,200
Stop the car!

553
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:04,300
Oh,shit!

554
01:01:09,310 --> 01:01:10,700
What are you doing?

555
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:12,370
You're so tense.

556
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:14,800
You don't say.

557
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:21,040
I make you relax,okay?

558
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:25,220
Yeah.  I'm good at this.

559
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:27,920
Making tense go away.

560
01:01:36,930 --> 01:01:38,090
What are you doing?

561
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:43,070
I want to feel sex one more time before I die.

562
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:44,740
Don't you?

563
01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:49,440
What is it with you and dying?

564
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,540
There is something wrong with me?

565
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:55,410
Am I not sexy?

566
01:01:56,790 --> 01:01:57,910
Yeah,you're sexy.

567
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:04,950
You're the gay.

568
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:09,490
Nope,I am not the gay.

569
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:11,600
I don't mind.

570
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:15,140
I'm not,okay?

571
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:20,240
Then what's the problem?

572
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:26,140
Did it ever occur to you that maybe I'm not in the mood?

573
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:46,990
I thought rule is don't open package.  It is.

574
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,900
Why you have rules if you break them?

575
01:02:50,170 --> 01:02:51,870
I keep asking myself the same thing.

576
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:55,330
Phone books.

577
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:06,150
You're the package.  Yes.

578
01:03:07,190 --> 01:03:08,550
Could have said something.

579
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:11,690
Would it make a difference?  Yes.

580
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,130
Now what are you doing?

581
01:03:15,330 --> 01:03:17,770
You know,back in garage...

582
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:22,840
it was very turn-on to me when you take off your clothes.

583
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:25,700
I was trying to keep five cretins from caving my head in.

584
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:27,340
I don't see the turn-on in that.

585
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:32,610
You think it's only man gets turned on by striptease?

586
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:34,840
I don't like where this is going,Valentina.

587
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:38,020
Would you striptease for me again?

588
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,350
Give me the keys. This is not funny.

589
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:42,680
You want keys?

590
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:49,530
I want you to stop playing around,is what I want.

591
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:53,000
Maybe it's last chance to play around for you and for me.

592
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,690
This is not the time or the place for playing.

593
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:59,970
Why do I get feeling with you it's never time or place?

594
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:02,470
If I wanna get analyzed,I'll see a psychiatrist.

595
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:04,910
Now,give me the keys.

596
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:07,780
Come on,Frank Martin.

597
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:10,210
Make playtime for me.

598
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:32,760
All right? That enough?

599
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:35,740
Not enough. That is not a striptease,Frank.

600
01:04:35,950 --> 01:04:39,440
Striptease is sexy. You know,move your ass a little.

601
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:41,810
Come on,Frank Martin.

602
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:44,020
You want keys?

603
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:47,220
I want strip.

604
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:56,020
You know what I'm gonna do to you for making me do this?

605
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:57,670
Spank me?

606
01:04:58,230 --> 01:04:59,460
For starters.

607
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:02,260
Tie me up?  You'd like that,wouldn't you?

608
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:06,330
I like the rough stuff.

609
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:11,700
Really?

610
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:18,780
Oh,but not too rough.

611
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:22,160
Deal was a striptease for the keys.

612
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:25,820
New deal. Kiss me for the keys.

613
01:05:33,470 --> 01:05:34,870
Like you mean it.

614
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:44,240
Do you ever kiss like you mean it,Frank?

615
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:47,750
I'm thinking maybe not.

616
01:05:47,950 --> 01:05:50,210
I'm thinking you live alone.

617
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:53,150
Inside and outside.

618
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:56,930
Thinking it is not dying you're afraid of.

619
01:05:57,130 --> 01:05:58,990
It's living.

620
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:00,790
Live with me.

621
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,760
Just this once.

622
01:06:02,970 --> 01:06:06,420
Just this moment. Live with me.

623
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:50,680
What's his position?  We lost him.

624
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:56,740
He headed into the mountains. We can't get reception up there.

625
01:06:56,950 --> 01:06:59,350
Hack into one of the military satellites.

626
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:07,650
Yes.

627
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:10,130
You think we're playing games here,Mr Minister?

628
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:12,130
I don't know what you're talking about.

629
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:15,670
I'm talking about a black car full of your incompetent operatives.

630
01:07:15,870 --> 01:07:18,930
One more move like that and you will never see your daughter again.

631
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:20,540
I want to hear her voice.

632
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:23,370
When the contract is signed and delivered.

633
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:25,980
I will not sign until I hear her voice.

634
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:28,780
You are in no position to play hardball,Mr Minister.

635
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:31,610
Well,neither are you,Mr Johnson.

636
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,480
Yes,I know who you are.

637
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:37,880
And I can assure you,if anything happens to my daughter...

638
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:39,960
I will use all the power I have.

639
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:45,600
I will hunt you down and make you pay in a most hideous way for this.

640
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,230
We have to move now.

641
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:58,110
Pick up,Frank. Pick up.

642
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:17,790
I'm in Ibiza. Making holiday.

643
01:08:23,110 --> 01:08:25,370
Someone hands me glass of champagne.

644
01:08:25,570 --> 01:08:27,370
I drink.

645
01:08:28,110 --> 01:08:30,580
Then I don't feel so good.

646
01:08:43,530 --> 01:08:46,650
I go to bathroom,and next thing,I'm awake in the car.

647
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:51,660
I ask him,"Where is this?" He tells me he's just a transporter.

648
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:57,900
He's pretty good driver.

649
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:01,000
Not like you good.

650
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:07,910
I tell him,"Please. My father a really powerful man.

651
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:12,490
Big influence. Knows a lot of people. Let me call him."

652
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:15,220
He's afraid. He's never done this before.

653
01:09:16,030 --> 01:09:20,590
It's supposed to be simple. Pick up,drop off. Easy money.

654
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:24,130
He's been told no calls,never leave car.

655
01:09:24,770 --> 01:09:26,500
But I convince him.

656
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,030
I call.

657
01:09:30,710 --> 01:09:32,940
But before I say to my father where we are...

658
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:34,440
Inside the car. Come on!

659
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:42,780
We get away,but...

660
01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:48,580
There's people shooting at us. Why?

661
01:09:48,790 --> 01:09:50,950
Why they shooting at us?

662
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:56,060
He says they shoot because we didn't go according to plan.

663
01:09:56,430 --> 01:10:00,890
I said,"Okay,that's the old plan. What's new plan?"

664
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:03,400
He says he has a friend.

665
01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:14,610
And then I met you.

666
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:20,080
And then I feel it's gonna be okay.

667
01:10:24,690 --> 01:10:26,920
You didn't even know me.

668
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:29,060
Of course I don't know you.

669
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:32,760
I talk about feelings,not knowing.

670
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:39,240
Well,if you was feeling that way,you sure had a funny way of showing it.

671
01:10:40,010 --> 01:10:43,600
Better for a woman to have a little mystery to her.

672
01:10:43,810 --> 01:10:45,280
No?

673
01:10:46,850 --> 01:10:48,340
No.

674
01:10:48,850 --> 01:10:52,150
Yes. Just a little.

675
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:20,740
He's back on the radar,sir.

676
01:11:25,790 --> 01:11:27,690
Yeah.  Where the hell are you?

677
01:11:27,890 --> 01:11:29,080
On the way to Bucharest.

678
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:30,820
Not any longer.

679
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:36,490
New coordinates: 3-7-13.

680
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:16,200
Excuse me,Mr. Minister.

681
01:12:16,870 --> 01:12:19,030
Sorry,just a minute.

682
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:21,330
Inspector Tarconi,from Marseilles.

683
01:12:22,950 --> 01:12:25,210
Well,not exactly Marseilles...

684
01:12:25,410 --> 01:12:28,350
but a small town to the east What do you want,inspector?

685
01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:30,210
A word with you.  I have no time.

686
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:32,690
It's about your daughter.

687
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:44,560
Odessa,Frank. My country.

688
01:12:45,230 --> 01:12:48,330
You take me home. Thank you.

689
01:12:50,410 --> 01:12:52,310
What happened to Bucharest?

690
01:12:53,910 --> 01:12:58,740
Change of plans.  It's a good change. I prefer Odessa.

691
01:12:59,410 --> 01:13:01,010
Yeah.

692
01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:05,080
I was looking forward to that fish with the carrots myself.

693
01:13:05,290 --> 01:13:07,280
Oh,it's much better here.

694
01:13:07,490 --> 01:13:10,580
You know chicken Kiev?  I do.

695
01:13:10,790 --> 01:13:12,990
I know restaurant here.

696
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:14,530
Best in the world.

697
01:13:14,730 --> 01:13:19,060
The chicken's so fresh. And the butter,when it's coming out...

698
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:21,400
Like you cannot believe,it's so nice.

699
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:29,540
You know what I feel like now?

700
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:33,880
Hungry.

701
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:38,750
Safe.

702
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:51,230
It's going to end up like the movies,this happily ever after?

703
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:57,530
By tonight,this is all gonna be a fading memory.

704
01:13:58,010 --> 01:14:02,000
It's gonna be you and me,laughing over chicken Kiev.

705
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:05,640
Liar.

706
01:14:23,770 --> 01:14:25,860
Mr. Minister,an update,please.

707
01:14:27,570 --> 01:14:32,010
I am ready to sign the contract once I speak to my daughter.

708
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,710
Hello? Hello?

709
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:39,910
Have that pen ready. I'll call you back.

710
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,720
Yeah.  We are closing the noose,Frank.

711
01:14:51,330 --> 01:14:54,660
Well,when it closes,make sure no one tries to drag me out of the car.

712
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:56,390
You know what this is about yet?

713
01:14:57,630 --> 01:15:00,120
The girl. Her father.

714
01:15:00,470 --> 01:15:02,990
Large amounts of toxic waste.

715
01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:05,540
It is a trade. His signature for her life.

716
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:10,340
I have a reputation to uphold here,inspector.

717
01:15:10,550 --> 01:15:13,780
One hundred percent successful delivery rate.

718
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:17,440
Am I detecting a little attachment?

719
01:15:17,950 --> 01:15:23,220
That is not the Frank I know. With his rules,no names,no attachment.

720
01:15:23,430 --> 01:15:25,620
Why is everyone so concerned about my rules?

721
01:15:26,330 --> 01:15:31,930
Frank,I always suspected you are a romantic at heart.

722
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:34,890
Anything else?

723
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:37,770
Where is the rendezvous?

724
01:15:37,970 --> 01:15:39,910
I'll call you back.

725
01:15:44,650 --> 01:15:47,270
Yeah.  We're almost at the end,Frank.

726
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:50,040
Just give me the coordinates.  No more coordinates.

727
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:52,740
The road you're on.

728
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:54,420
Make your first left.

729
01:15:55,220 --> 01:15:56,710
I'd like to know where I'm going.

730
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:03,960
You'll know when you get there.

731
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,260
Don't worry. We got them right where we want them.

732
01:16:43,210 --> 01:16:45,170
My compliments,Frank.

733
01:16:45,370 --> 01:16:49,000
Our trust in your abilities was well deserved.

734
01:16:49,580 --> 01:16:51,340
Now if you could please send the girl out.

735
01:16:53,050 --> 01:16:54,540
She's coming.

736
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:57,010
I'm not coming.

737
01:16:57,720 --> 01:16:59,850
They need you. They won't kill you.

738
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:02,390
But they will kill you.

739
01:17:02,890 --> 01:17:06,160
Do I look like a man who came halfway across Europe to die on a bridge?

740
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,390
Do I?

741
01:17:18,670 --> 01:17:21,140
We don't have all day,Frank.

742
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:26,540
Look how many of them.

743
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:28,680
They have all the guns.

744
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,040
How it's gonna be okay?

745
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:35,520
Tell you over dinner.

746
01:17:37,190 --> 01:17:38,390
Now,go.

747
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:40,590
Go.

748
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,520
Kiss me.

749
01:17:59,410 --> 01:18:00,900
Go.

750
01:18:05,790 --> 01:18:08,350
You're gonna get me killed. Now,go.

751
01:18:33,050 --> 01:18:35,240
Get to her,you bastard.

752
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:02,670
Better now,darling?

753
01:19:21,130 --> 01:19:22,620
Finish him.

754
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:44,450
No! Frank!

755
01:19:55,730 --> 01:19:58,220
His beloved car will be his grave.

756
01:19:58,430 --> 01:20:01,300
Leaves it,he blows. Stays,he drowns. Let's get out of here.

757
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:14,540
Tarconi.  They have the girl.

758
01:20:15,820 --> 01:20:19,250
Frank,we are trying to track him through the phone signal.

759
01:20:19,450 --> 01:20:21,680
Where are you?  In a lake.

760
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:24,550
A lake?

761
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:26,930
Can you be more specific?

762
01:20:27,130 --> 01:20:28,390
There's a dam.

763
01:20:30,070 --> 01:20:32,000
A dam?  I know the place,sir.

764
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:34,000
How far?  Ten minutes at least.

765
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:36,070
Frank,we'll be there in 10 minutes.

766
01:20:36,270 --> 01:20:37,570
Can you make it any faster?

767
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:40,340
We'll do our best.  Thank you.

768
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:40,280
Buy tickets for all of us.

769
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:42,290
Where to?

770
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:46,430
Anywhere this train is going. We need to keep moving for half an hour.

771
01:22:46,630 --> 01:22:48,570
Why don't we just keep driving around?

772
01:22:54,210 --> 01:22:55,610
Another day.

773
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:12,620
Sir! There!

774
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:33,970
Out. Out!  Everybody out!

775
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:35,610
Come on.  Move!

776
01:23:36,380 --> 01:23:37,910
Move,quick!

777
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:57,570
Mr. Minister?  Yes.

778
01:23:58,210 --> 01:23:59,900
Someone wants to talk to you.

779
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:03,900
Papa.  Are you all right?

780
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:10,140
Don't sign.

781
01:24:10,850 --> 01:24:13,910
What you have is 15 minutes.

782
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:23,890
You ever find out what this is about?  Garbage.

783
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:25,620
How much garbage are we talking?

784
01:24:26,570 --> 01:24:30,130
Enough to pollute half the country for a hundred years.

785
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:31,330
Try it again.

786
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:55,390
For a modern woman,you are very uninformed.

787
01:24:55,660 --> 01:24:57,320
This is the new world.

788
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:00,760
There are no more countries. That's old think.

789
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:04,570
There are just economic realities. Profit and loss.

790
01:25:04,770 --> 01:25:07,500
Efficiency and waste.

791
01:25:07,710 --> 01:25:09,700
Think global,not local.

792
01:25:10,510 --> 01:25:12,450
Think this.

793
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:29,230
Yes?  Where are we?

794
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:38,330
We're almost there.

795
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:42,340
Where?

796
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:44,570
Here. He is on a train.

797
01:25:45,210 --> 01:25:47,550
And where are we?  Here.

798
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:49,940
We can get units there.

799
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:53,420
That's a good idea. Do that.

800
01:25:57,390 --> 01:26:00,230
Oh,Frank,come on.

801
01:26:32,130 --> 01:26:34,690
Mr. Minister,I assure you,everything is in order.

802
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:36,760
I'm sure it is.

803
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:41,030
If there are any problems I know you will solve them.

804
01:26:41,970 --> 01:26:43,870
Now,if you don't mind...

805
01:27:14,270 --> 01:27:17,800
You might not believe this,but I am,at heart,a pacifist.

806
01:27:19,070 --> 01:27:21,130
I hate violence.

807
01:27:23,140 --> 01:27:25,940
It creates more problems than it solves.

808
01:27:27,580 --> 01:27:30,420
You know,I never wanted to do any of this.

809
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:34,980
A client asked me to obtain a result...

810
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:37,550
so I went about creating an environment...

811
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:39,520
with the least amount of bloodshed.

812
01:27:39,730 --> 01:27:42,460
No one wanted to cooperate. Not you,not the first driver...

813
01:27:42,660 --> 01:27:46,430
not your father,not the recently deceased Frank Martin.

814
01:27:47,570 --> 01:27:50,130
Everyone wanted to fight.

815
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:06,710
What's so funny?

816
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:10,450
Hearing a dead man talking.

817
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:25,260
One more step,Frank.

818
01:30:25,690 --> 01:30:27,220
Come on. One more.

819
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:12,270
Look.

820
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:13,660
It's over.

821
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:16,240
Two minutes to 9. He signed.

822
01:31:20,050 --> 01:31:22,140
Oh,my God.

823
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:28,850
No,Frank. No,no.

824
01:32:09,860 --> 01:32:12,300
It's over,Frank. It's over.

825
01:32:13,570 --> 01:32:16,040
Mission accomplished. You and the girl are free to go.

826
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:19,970
Matter of fact,I'm so impressed by your talent...

827
01:32:20,170 --> 01:32:21,840
I'd like to offer you a position.

828
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:25,340
I'd like to offer you one. Permanently disabled.

829
01:32:44,630 --> 01:32:45,960
I hate to waste talent.

830
01:32:46,170 --> 01:32:48,470
But I really don't think we'd make a very good fit.

831
01:32:48,670 --> 01:32:50,160
That's right.

832
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:15,050
No!

833
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:22,160
We wouldn't fit,but you and the bracelet were made for each other.

834
01:33:26,740 --> 01:33:28,000
No,no.

835
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:40,340
No!

836
01:33:41,990 --> 01:33:43,220
No!

837
01:33:58,940 --> 01:34:00,800
You're doing the right thing.

838
01:34:20,660 --> 01:34:22,390
Valentina.

839
01:34:27,540 --> 01:34:28,760
Valentina.

840
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:41,210
Am I in heaven?

841
01:34:44,350 --> 01:34:46,620
Looks more like we're in hell.

842
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:48,920
I don't care.

843
01:34:49,260 --> 01:34:50,920
As long as we're there together.

844
01:35:03,270 --> 01:35:04,330
Yes?

845
01:35:04,540 --> 01:35:07,700
Mr. Minister,your daughter is in good hands.

846
01:35:09,210 --> 01:35:10,800
Thank you.

847
01:35:25,330 --> 01:35:27,730
What are you doing?  What you said,the right thing.

848
01:35:27,930 --> 01:35:31,160
And now,gentlemen. if you'll excuse me,I have a conference to address...

849
01:35:31,370 --> 01:35:34,300
on the dangers of doing business with people like you.

850
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:35,490
Thank you very much.

851
01:35:54,690 --> 01:35:55,710
Is the launch ready?

852
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:58,260
It's on the water,sir,waiting.  Time to leave.

853
01:35:58,990 --> 01:36:00,320
Grab the log.  Okay.

854
01:36:19,450 --> 01:36:22,310
I just don't understand it.

855
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:24,480
When I was a boy,my father and I...

856
01:36:24,690 --> 01:36:28,020
used to pull fish out of this very spot all day long.

857
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:29,850
Times change,inspector.

858
01:36:30,460 --> 01:36:32,190
As do people.

859
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:37,130
You referring to me?

860
01:36:38,700 --> 01:36:40,790
I don't think that's a very accurate statement.

861
01:36:41,740 --> 01:36:43,970
I drive the same car,live in the same house.

862
01:36:44,170 --> 01:36:48,300
Oh,I was not referring to your car or your house.

863
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:53,540
The sea is so restful.

864
01:36:53,750 --> 01:36:54,910
Is lunch ready yet?

865
01:36:56,180 --> 01:36:59,480
Mademoiselle,there is a certain progression to things.

866
01:36:59,690 --> 01:37:03,020
In order to eat the lunch,you first have to catch the lunch.

867
01:37:03,220 --> 01:37:05,450
And if we keep talking instead of concentrating...

868
01:37:05,660 --> 01:37:06,990
we're gonna catch nothing.

869
01:37:07,190 --> 01:37:10,930
I have better idea. Why we don't skip catching of lunch...

870
01:37:11,130 --> 01:37:13,070
and go right to eating of lunch?

871
01:37:13,270 --> 01:37:16,430
I know wonderful place just up coast from here...

872
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:19,540
where they make fish stew. Incredible.

873
01:37:19,740 --> 01:37:25,510
They use tomatoes and onions,and little amount of wild lavender.

874
01:37:26,210 --> 01:37:28,110
What kind of wine?

875
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:30,040
Pink. From south.

876
01:37:31,350 --> 01:37:33,180
A Chateauneuf,perhaps.

877
01:37:33,650 --> 01:37:36,090
Chilled.  Of course,chilled.

878
01:37:36,290 --> 01:37:38,220
And for dessert?
