1
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,200
Hi. Are you lost?

2
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,000
Want to play?

3
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,300
I bet you can't catch me!

4
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,900
Come on! It's okay!

5
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,200
Are you sure you want to stay in this old cabin?

6
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,600
It's a bit of a fixer-upper.

7
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,400
You and I have very different definitions of "old. "

8
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,400
It seems if a building stays upright for more than a decade,

9
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,900
you people declare it a national landmark.

10
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
No.

11
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,100
This cabin has all the modern means I need.

12
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,000
It's certainly preferable to that motel.

13
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,900
You know, we could spackle the bullet holes. Unless you want to keep them.

14
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,800
No, no.

15
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
By all means, we'll... spackle.

16
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,500
You know you can admit when you don't know what a word means.

17
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,200
This is the ideal setting for you, though.

18
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,600
It's rustic, by the lake...

19
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,800
Maybe Corbin meant for us to find this place.

20
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,600
An act of faith?

21
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,600
That's unusual, coming from you.

22
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,500
It's true.

23
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,900
Never been a big believer of what I can't see.

24
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,300
And the irony isn't lost on me, okay?

25
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,800
I get I'm supposed to be a player in the Big Guy's endgame, but...

26
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,800
I'm not ready to abandon my better judgment outright.

27
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,500
What is this impenetrable barrier around this instrument?

28
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,800
It's called plastic.

29
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,800
That's why I bought scissors.

30
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,800
Miss Mills...

31
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,200
- Do you think I look out of place in this century? 
- You look good for 200.

32
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,700
- But a change of clothes wouldn't hurt. 
- Unit 27, citizen flag down.

33
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,000
Boy unconscious and breathing.

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Requesting an R/A and additional unit to Market and Fifth.

35
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,100
Lieutenant Mills. I have a close ETA.

36
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,600
Show me en route.

37
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,700
It's a routine call.

38
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,800
I think routine is a thing of the past for us.

39
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,700
- What have we got?
- The boy was seen stumbling down the street.

40
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,200
Then he just passed out. Mail carrier over there called it in.

41
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,700
I saw him along my route earlier.

42
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,400
He was coming out of the woods by Rockefeller Preserve.

43
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,400
- Anyone with him? 
- No. Witnesses say he was unaccompanied.

44
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,100
Wish I could say the same for you.

45
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,200
Don't you get tired of being a babysitter?

46
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,000
You know, for a detective, you really don't have a clue.

47
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Lieutenant.

48
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,900
The boy's hands.

49
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,000
Blackening veins.

50
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,500
Is this condition common in this time?

51
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,300
- Not in the slightest. 
- The garments he's wearing...

52
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,300
their simplicity...

53
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,100
He looks like he got lost on his way back from a Renaissance Faire.

54
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,400
<i>Euel perne.</i>

55
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,800
Did he just say "euel perne"?

56
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,900
I take it that means something to you.

57
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,000
it's a language you, too, are familiar with.

58
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,700
English.

59
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,200
<i>Hwon be pa euel perne?</i>

60
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,100
We've got to get him loaded.

61
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,200
That is not any English we speak around here.

62
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,200
That's because it's Middle English.

63
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,500
The sort only spoken in the Middle Ages.

64

67
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,600
Hundreds of children go missing in this country?

68
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,500
Sadly, yes. It's called kidnapping.

69
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,200
And though I'm hoping this boy isn't a victim,

70
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:32,000
we keep a database of all reported abductions
and this could be our only way to ID him.

71
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,500
Until then, he's a John Doe at Westchester Memorial, 

72
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,100
and we've got no way to explain what's happening to him.

73
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,600
John Doe is what we call somebody...

74
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,900
Someone whose identity is unknown, yes.

75
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,600
The term came into being in Britain, thank you. Long before my time.

76
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,200
As is his language, Captain.

77
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,600
- The boy speaks Middle English. 
- Naturally.

78
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,200
I... studied it at Oxford.

79
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,500
It's the language of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales for example.

80
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,100
So did the boy go to Oxford,

81
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,900
or are you suggesting that we're dealing with someone from King Arthur's court?

82
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,800
All I can tell you is the boy said, "Euel perne,"

83
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,700
which means "evil girl" in a dead version of our language.

84
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,300
Any leads I'm going to like?

85
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,100
No trace of him in the national database. Nobody's looking for him.

86
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,900
Morales has even tried local Amish communities.

87
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,200
It seems his identity is as much of a mystery as his disorder.

88
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,300
I've contacted the CDC. Centers for Disease Control.

89
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,400
This CDC... Do they think the illness could spread?

90
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,700
When I described the black veining on the boy's arms,

91
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,700
they said they'd send someone to take a look.

92
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,900
We don't want an epidemic. Brush up on your Chaucer, Crane.

93
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,000
I need you to question our John Doe.

94
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,300
Hey, Captain.

95
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,400
What's on your mind, Morales?

96
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,400
Well, sir, it's a small town.

97
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,300
- There's been a lot of talk. 
- About...?

98
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,900
Well, this guy Crane. He was a suspect.

99
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,400
Now he's a consultant? What's he doing here?

100
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,500
You and Lieutenant Mills have... history.

101
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,900
Is that gonna cause a problem, Morales?

102
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,700
- No, sir. 
- Good.

103
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,100
Crane's knowledge of the beheadings

104
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,900
makes him an important advisor to me right now.

105
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,400
So until we catch the perp behind them,

106
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,900
I'd advise you to stay focused on your work.

107
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,800
Yes, sir.

108
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,200
this area is under quartine

109
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,000
This is the stuff of nightmares.

110
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,200
Lieutenant Mills, we're ready for you now.

111
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,000
- This isolation will only scare him more. 
- They have to do it.

112
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,800
- The plastic barriers keeps the contaminated air contained. 
- Yes, plastic.

113
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,500
How did we survive without it?

114
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,500
You will speak into this camera. Here's what I need to know for starters...

115
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,000
What did the vector eat, what drugs has he tried, where's he from, and where's he been.

116
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,700
While you may see in there a nameless, faceless source,

117
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,500
I see a boy, and I intend to treat him as such.

118
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,000
Whatever it takes.

119
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,900
hello

120
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,100
don't be afrard..

121
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,200
I am Ichabod

122
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,500
what is your name?

123
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,900
Thomas.

124
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,300
Thomas Grey.

125
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:51,900
hello,Thomas
I know how frightened you must be.

126
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:56,600
I understand, and I'm here to help.

127
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,600
may I ask you some questions?

128
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,400
Thank you.

129
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,900
thank you 

130
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:10,300
I am sorry.I know I was not supposed to.

131
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,700
sorry for what,Thomas?

132
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,700
has it to do with the girl you spoke of?

133
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,100
the evil girl

134
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:27,300
I followed her. I know I should not have left.

135
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,000
left your home?

136
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,700
It seems he was forbidden from leaving his home.

137
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,000
We see this all the time.

138
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,200
People, monsters, keep kids caged up.

139
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,900
- Threaten them if they break rules. 
- And teach them Middle English?

140
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,000
Maybe. That's one way of keep them from asking for help.

141
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,700
Or the boy is lost and disoriented by his surroundings.

142
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,800
I think most of us can relate to that.

143
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,800
Where's he from? I need a location.

144
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,900
Thomas?where is your home?

145
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,200
roanoke.

146
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,800
Roanoke?

147
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,200
I need all the hospitals contacted in Roanoke, Virginia.

148
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,600
Find everything going in and out of their doors.

149
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,700
I'll have the department contact local law enforcement.

150
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,100
Track down his family.

151
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,200
No... I think Parsons may be looking in the wrong place.

152
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,800
The boy did say Roanoke, right?

153
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,500
But I don't think Thomas meant a Roanoke

154
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,200
you'd find on today's map.

155
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,000
The older version of English, his antiquated appearance...

156
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,300
What if Thomas is from the Lost Colony?

157
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,300
What lost colony?

158
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,800
Roanoke was the very first British colony
(roanoke island , north carolina,1587)

159
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,800
in the New World, led by Governor John White.

160
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,800
In fact, White's daughter and her husband produced

161
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,500
the very first American-born colonist,

162
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,200
their daughter, Virginia Dare.

163
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,800
So, White returned to Europe for provisions for the colony.

164
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,200
And when he got back to Roanoke, everyone was gone?

165
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,800
Not a single person was there.
(3 years later ,1590)

166
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,300
They had disappeared.

167
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,700
It became known as the Lost Colony.

168
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,500
That's pretty weird. We still haven't found 'em.

169
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,200
Perhaps, because they've relocated to Sleepy Hollow.

170
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,100
True, we found a kid that looks like he stepped off the Mayflower,

171
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,400
but that does not mean

172
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,400
that a colony that vanished from North Carolina

173
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,200
400 years ago has relocated to the neighborhood.

174
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,600
I did say "perhaps," Lieutenant.

175
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,000
And I can name a few stranger turns of events.

176
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,800
You really believe anything is possible.

177
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,500
My own circumstance makes me open to the prospect.

178
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,700
Sir, I'm gonna put you on speakerphone.

179
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,200
Thomas' disease is starting to spread.

180
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,800
The black veining has taken over more of his body, but...

181
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,300
the EMT who treated him...

182
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,900
He's been infected.

183
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,400
He's deteriorating rapidly.

184
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,000
A couple of nurses have been feeling ill.

185
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,700
This may be an outbreak.

186
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,900
Captain, we are onto a theory.

187
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,300
And we will get right back to you as soon as we do some more digging.

188
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,400
Thank you, sir.

189
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,300
Well, we had dig quickly.

190
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,900
If Thomas does indeed carry a plague...

191
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,300
and one from half a millennium ago...

192
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,300
the effects could be apocalyptic.

193
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,300
Okay. We'll start looking in the woods where they found him.

194
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,200
And perhaps...

195
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,300
Perhaps we will find the Lost Colony of Roanoke.

196
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,100
Word must have spread about the virus.

197
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,900
Looks like people are leaving town.

198
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,900
Can you blame them?

199
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,700
So, here we are.

200
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,000
This is where the mail carrier saw Thomas,

201
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,800
right near the "Welcome to Roanoke" sign.

202
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,200
Yours isn't the first generation to invent sarcasm.

203
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,800
the rockefeller state park preserve
which's spring treil

204
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,300
So who was more sarcastic, Jefferson or Adams?

205
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,200
Is this more sarcasm?

206
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,900
No, I'm serious.

207
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,600
I'm not saying.

208
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,300
Come on. Please?

209
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,300
I'll tell you this...

210
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,800
Jefferson had an obsession with puns,

211
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,200
and Adams kept a notebook of unsavory limericks.

212
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,700
Seriously?

213
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,100
Welcome to Roanoke.

214
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,500
According to my phone's compass app,

215
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,600
we're heading due east.

216
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,200
Just not sure if we're heading in the right direction... if there is one.

217
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,600
I suspect there is, and we are on it.

218
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,100
Look.

219
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,000
This spiderweb has been broken at about Thomas' height,

220
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,700
and these footfalls are the same I've been tracking since we began.

221
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,500
I'm afraid your so-called smart phone couldn't tell you that.

222
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,300
Look at you, copping some 'tude.

223
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,000
There's more.

224
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,200
Jones, Morales, meet me at Westchester Memorial in 30 minutes.

225
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,900
- We got to compare notes with the CDC. 
- You got it, Captain.

226
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,100
Did you talk to him about bringing the new guy in?

227
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,800
- Yeah. 
- What'd he say?

228
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,700
Basically, to keep our heads down and do as we're told.

229
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,900
Fine by me.

230
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,800
Let's keep the captain on our good side.

231
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,600
He's axing us out.

232
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,800
Hey, score enough points, maybe me and you move on to bigger and better.

233
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,900
Think about it. NYPD.

234
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:03,000
What does an Oxford history professor know about serial killings in Sleepy Hollow?

235
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,100
If he even is who he says.

236
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,500
Obviously the captain knows something we don't.

237
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,200
Just let it go.

238
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,600
I'll meet you at the hospital. I'm gonna make some calls.

239
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,600
All right.

240
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,900
<i>Mimosa pudica.</i>

241
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,200
It closes up for days in response to human touch.

242
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,400
Thomas has been here.

243
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,600
Seriously, where did you learn to track like this?

244
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,100
Fox hunting, actually.

245
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,000
Excuse me.

246
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Mm. My father was a nobleman.

247
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,200
I had a rather regal upbringing.

248
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,200
That's one thing I'm pleased to have left behind.

249
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,200
These footprints are different from Thomas'.

250
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,100
Right.
He was barefoot.

251
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,900
You can see the outline of his toes, but not in these.

252
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,100
Maybe they belong to the girl he mentioned.

253
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,100
The evil girl.

254
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,700
They stop out of nowhere.

255
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,900
Where did she go?

256
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,400
Perhaps she was never even here to begin with.

257
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,400
Look...

258
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,900
Lost colony or not, we have to be prepared

259
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,000
for whatever's on the other side of that trail.

260
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,000
Are you all right?

261
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,400
Let's keep going.

262
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,700
We've got two more patients. Both on the scene when the boy went down.

263
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,300
is coming out ???
Are we any closer to knowing where Patient Zero came from?

264
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,600
Still searching. We're working on a possible bioterrorism angle.

265
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,500
Looked into a new cult that's surfaced. So far, no link to them.

266
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,600
Why do the others seem more sick than the kid?

267
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,300
People's immune systems react differently.

268
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,600
Some may not be affected. Others may be completely compromised.

269
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,100
The vector must come from a very different environment than ours.

270
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,800
- Why is that? 
- His blood panels.

271
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,900
They show traces of foreign antibodies and a lack of others present in our population.

272
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,500
There's no evidence he's ever been vaccinated against anything.

273
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,200
To inoculate everyone else against this thing, we need to identify it.

274
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,900
We're coming across nothing like it in our database.

275
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,700
I have got officers retracing the boy's trail as we speak.

276
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,800
This is where Thomas' trail ends.

277
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,100
Or... more accurately, begins.

278
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:51,400
I believe the answer to his survival lies somewhere over there.

279
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,300
That tiny island?

280
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,000
There's nothing on it.

281
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,600
Looks can be deceiving, Lieutenant.

282
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,900
Perhaps this is how the community has remained hidden.

283
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,700
Sure. Maybe.

284
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,000
Are you telling me you think the kid swam across this?

285
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,200
No...

286
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,500
No, his feet were covered in muck, but not the rest of him.

287
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,200
Okay.

288
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,800
We're gonna have to find another way over there.

289
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,600
Crane. Crane!

290
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,900
This is how Thomas made it across.

291
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,900
How did you know that?

292
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:51,300
Markings on these trees indicate a hidden crossing.

293
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,000
Step this way, Miss Mills.

294
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,400
they have come.

295
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,900
What is this place?

296
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,200
where are we?

297
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,800
roanoke

298
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,200
Crane... they're all infected.

299
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,500
They have the black veins, but don't seem sick.

300
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,300
Yes. Quite curious.

301
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,900
So this is where Thomas was raised.

302
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,900
In a community that hasn't changed in some 400 years.

303
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,500
How is that possible?

304
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,400
why did you leave roanoke?

305
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,300
the land of roanoke was cursed...

306
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,800
...by the horseman of pertilence.

307
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,400
he rode through one night...

308
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,600
...infecting us all.

309
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,800
the youngest among us...

310
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,300
...was the first life of many lost.

311
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,800
Virginia Dare.

312
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,400
yes

313
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,100
shority after her death, her spirit appeared.

314
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,000
and lead us away...

315
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,600
...to safety

316
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,500
The spirit of Virginia Dare guided the colonists here to protect them.

317
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,600
Protect them? But they all have the disease.

318
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,100
how are you all well,

319
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,600
if you have the same disease Thomas does?

320
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,700
its symptoms cannot affect ue here.

321
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,600
when Thomas left...

322
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,400
...he took the plague with him to the outside.

323
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,500
it is what the horseman wanted all alone.

324
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,700
how do we save Thomas?

325
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,100
and the others he could infect?

326
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,100
you must return him here.

327
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,300
to save them all.

328
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,900
before its too late.

329
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,400
The spirit of Virginia Dare seems to watch over them here,

330
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,000
keeping their symptoms at bay.

331
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,500
Sort of like Katrina putting a spell on you to keep you alive.

332
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,700
It seems the colonists of Roanoke and I share much in common.

333
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,100
In order to save Thomas, we must bring him back.

334
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,900
I'm no Middle English expert,

335
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,600
but I could've sworn I heard the word "horseman" thrown in there.

336
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,600
Indeed you did, though not the headless one with whom we are acquainted.

337
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,300
The colony was infected with this plague

338
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:47,200
by the Horseman of Pestilence, also known as Conquest.

339
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,600
- So another Horseman of the Apocalypse has arrived? 
- Not yet.

340
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,900
And not if we can stop it.

341
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,800
Pestilence instituted this plague centuries ago,

342
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,400
stopping its spread and thwarting the Horseman from riding forth.

343
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,800
It's been unleashed anew through Thomas.

344
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,800
If it manages to spread this time...

345
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,100
Then the Horseman of Pestilence will come to Sleepy Hollow

346
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,700
and join forces with the Horseman of Death.

347
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,000
We must prevent this at all costs.

348
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,200
And I think bringing Thomas here will be the answer.

349
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,100
thank you

350
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,200
for watching over me son.

351
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,300
it is my privilege.

352
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,000
No, thank you. You keep it.

353
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,700
Crane.

354
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,400
We gotta get going.

355
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,500
we shall return with your boy.

356
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,000
If what you saw in the Roanoke forest enters our world,

357
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,500
modern medicine will be defenseless against it.

358
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,100
Oh, my God, you're infected.

359
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,900
Be it the protection of Virginia Dare,

360
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,100
or something in the environment,

361
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,200
the cure seems to lie within the colony.

362
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,500
Maybe, but the CDC is not going to let anyone leave the hospital.

363
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,500
And how are we supposed to get them to a place that no one believes exists?

364
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,500
It's spreading.

365
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:58,000
Miss Mills... These people are going to die here.

366
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,000
Do you think the Roanoke remedy

367
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,600
would even work on people other than Thomas?

368
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,400
Crane?

369
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,600
I've been infected.

370
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,800
- It was the colony. - Get me a Hazmat team in here.

371
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,900
No. No, I think it was earlier...

372
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,800
When I first encountered Thomas.

373
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,100
- We're ready, sir. 
- Get him into quarantine.

374
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,000
No. No, I feel perfectly fine.

375
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,500
Listen to him. Don't touch him. Do not take him!

376
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,300
- Stay back, he's contagious. 
- Stop this!

377
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,800
- No! I must help Thomas! 
- Sedate him!

378
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,200
No, I just... Please!

379
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,200
No!

380
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,200
- Katrina. 
- Ichabod?

381
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,100
Are you really here?

382
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,300
You're not well.

383
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,400
- How did you know? 
- Because you're here.

384
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,500
But I have been here before.

385
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,100
Only when I've summoned you.

386
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,300
I've... I've not been able to for some time.

387
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,300
If you are here in any other way...

388
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,200
it means that you are dead.

389
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,100
Or near to it.

390
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,400
Detective Morales.

391
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,700
Yes, hello, Detective.

392
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,800
I'm calling from the history department of Oxford's Merton College

393
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,100
- regarding your inquiry into a Mr. Ichabod Crane. 
- Yes.

394
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:12,600
He is indeed a tenured professor here, on sabbatical at the moment,

395
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,100
and on loan to law enforcement in Westchester County, New York.

396
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,400
- I see. 
- Is there any other way I may be of assistance?

397
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,900
No. No, no. Thank you. That's all I needed to know.

398
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,700
Everything okay, Morales?

399
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,400
Yes, sir. All good.

400
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,500
Track down Parsons from CDC.

401
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,800
We need to make a plan to control public response.

402
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,800
Yes, sir.

403
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,500
You must understand.

404
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,500
It's only under great duress you would find yourself here.

405
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,800
I am sick.

406
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,700
I did not realize how critically.

407
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,300
Another has died from this.

408
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,500
And I fear you will, too.

409
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,600
Ichabod, this place I've been trapped in, it's purgatory.

410
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,800
Purgatory?

411
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,800
Then those are...

412
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,200
Souls.

413
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,600
Who've been collected here.

414
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,300
We're all trapped together, and yet very much apart.

415
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,000
Those there are moving on.

416
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,400
To where?

417
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,000
To wherever he determines.

418
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,600
He?

419
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,500
The beast who keeps me captive.

420
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,400
Moloch.

421
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,100
Sir, I need a minute.

422
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,000
Don't have one.

423
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,900
But it's about Crane and the boy. If you can help me get them out...

424
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,000
They're not going anywhere.

425
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,600
We have most of Sleepy Hollow in an absolute panic over this potential epidemic.

426
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,400
The doctors will handle the patients. I need you on the streets.

427
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,200
We have to shut down the traffic moving in and out of town.

428
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,100
- There is no time for that. 
- My point exactly.

429
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,300
Report to Morales for your post.

430
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,200
Really?

431
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,700
what the hell.

432
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,400
Why would you be trapped in such a place?

433
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,500
What does Moloch want with your soul?

434
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,500
Katrina...

435
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,800
What is it you're not telling me?

436
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,100
If this is a trial...

437
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,800
I'm gonna need a little evidence.

438
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,700
Is that boy really gonna be saved if I get him back to his home?

439
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,400
What about the others? What about Crane?

440
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,700
Would he be saved at Roanoke

441
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:08,700
because it's... trapped in time like him?

442
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,300
Show... me... a sign.

443
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,400
Give me something.

444
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,200
Isn't that the kind of thing that you're known for?

445
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,800
Yep.

446
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,700
Didn't think so.

447
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,000
Something in the environment,

448
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,700
the cure seems to lie within the colony.

449
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,300
What is it you're afraid to say?

450
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,800
I believe I know why I am here.

451
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,400
Why I cannot leave.

452
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,300
Why?

453
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,700
Ichabod!

454
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,800
You fight for your life!

455
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,500
You fight for the both of us!

456
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,400
I need to get them back to the colony.

457
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I think that the springwater there could be what heals them.

458
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,600
Think about it.

459
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,700
Water is used in many religions as a way to purify.

460
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,700
Roanoke seems to be some sort of holy place.

461
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,500
So you think they need to baptized in it or something?

462
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,600
I do.

463
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,600
For now, we're just stalling the inevitable.

464
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,400
Thomas will die if he isn't returned. And Crane.

465
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,400
Do you really believe that's going to work?

466
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,500
I've got no choice but to believe.

467
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,300
Okay.

468
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,300
I think I have a way.

469
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,400
Another quarantine facility's been set up for projected overflow.

470
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,500
Parsons will get orders to transfer Thomas and Crane there,

471
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,800
creating an opportunity for you to get them to this colony.

472
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,200
I'll cover for you.

473
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,500
If the solution is there, I'll do what I can

474
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,900
to get the remaining infected to the location.

475
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,100
But, Abbie... Hurry.

476
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,400
Hey, what are you doing?!

477
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,800
Keep talking to me, Crane.

478
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,900
Keep your mind off the pain.

479
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,400
Katrina. I saw Katrina while I was unconscious.

480
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,700
And now I understand why I haven't been able to go there.

481
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,900
Why?

482
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,600
The place is...

483
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,000
is a purgatory

484
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:16,100
for souls left hanging in the balance,

485
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,100
caught between good and evil.

486
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,800
It's like a no-man's-land on a battlefield.

487
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,400
I'm glad you fought your way out of it.

488
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,200
Crane!

489
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,400
I'm all right.

490
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,100
I can't say the same for Thomas.

491
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,200
We're losing him.

492
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,400
It's weak, but he's still got a heartbeat.

493
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,400
We've got to keep moving. Almost there.

494
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:59,400
I'm so sorry. I feel a little faint.

495
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,100
You go on to Roanoke. Send the colonists back for us.

496
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,000
I cannot make it without you.

497
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,800
- Yes, you can. 
- All the trees look the same to me.

498
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,100
Hang on.

499
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,600
I need a little rest.

500
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,100
Hang on.

501
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:17,600
I think you just need a little, a little boost.

502
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,100
What was that?

503
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,100
Adrenaline.

504
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,100
I like it.

505
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,700
Let's keep moving.

506
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,200
Crane!

507
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,300
Get to the water! Run!

508
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,200
Crane!

509
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,300
Hurry!

510
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,400
Crane! Crane!

511
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,200
You were right.

512
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,900
The waters provide a cure.

513
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,000
What just happened?

514
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,300
Thomas...

515
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,700
He was dead all along. They all were.

516
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,900
But everyone else in Sleepy Hollow, they saw him.

517
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,800
They were affected by him.

518
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,400
He returned to flesh and blood...

519
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,000
once he was lured into our world to spread a plague.

520
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,200
But we stopped it.

521
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,100
Somehow.

522
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,600
You stopped it by having faith.

523
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,000
Your faith in being one of the Witnesses allowed you to see what your eyes could not.

524
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,700
- Captain? 
- You're not gonna believe this.

525
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,100
Try me.

526
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,600
We don't know how, but everyone's recovering.

527
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,800
I'm glad to hear it, sir. Thank you.

528
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,900
It's over. Everyone in town's gonna be fine.

529
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,800
Hey, I know everything has been so new for you,

530
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,900
so different.

531
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,100
It's been hard to adjust.

532
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,200
Actually, for a minute there,

533
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,500
I thought you might choose to stay in the colony.

534
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,200
But, Crane...

535
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,300
believe me...

536
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,900
when I say that you belong in Sleepy Hollow.

537
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,700
In the here and now.

538
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,200
Well...

539
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,200
What do you say we go home then?

540
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,200
We have much work to do.

541
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:43,100
We'll will require much more than faith if and when the Horseman of Death returns.

542
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:48,600
