1
00:04:04,743 --> 00:04:08,702
Help here!
Lend a hand! Anyone!

2
00:04:10,515 --> 00:04:15,851
- Constable Crane? Is that you?
- None other.

3
00:04:15,987 --> 00:04:21,323
Not only me. I found something
which was lately a man.

4
00:04:25,197 --> 00:04:28,655
- Burn it.
- Yes, sir.

5
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,534
- We do not know the cause of death.
- If found in the river, it is drowning.

6
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:41,201
We might determine whether he was
dead before he went into the river.

7
00:04:41,346 --> 00:04:46,113
- I will need to examine the body.
- Cut him up? Are we heathens?

8
00:04:48,453 --> 00:04:53,015
- What happened to him?
- Arrested for burglary.

9
00:04:59,764 --> 00:05:01,288
Good work.

10
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:04,297
The millennium is almost upon us.

11
00:05:04,436 --> 00:05:07,405
In a few months, we will be living
in the 19th century.

12
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:11,506
Yet our courts rely
on medieval methods of torture.

13
00:05:11,643 --> 00:05:15,773
- Stand down.
- I stand up, for sense and justice.

14
00:05:16,147 --> 00:05:20,015
Ourjails overflow with men convicted
on confessions worth no more...

15
00:05:20,151 --> 00:05:26,420
Constable Crane! This is a song we
have heard from you more than once.

16
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:30,655
There are two courses open to me.

17
00:05:30,795 --> 00:05:34,561
First, I can let you cool your heels
in the cells, -

18
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:37,725
- until you learn respect
for the dignity of my office...

19
00:05:37,869 --> 00:05:45,002
Why am I the only one who sees
that to solve crimes, detect the guilty, -

20
00:05:45,143 --> 00:05:51,139
- we must use our brains to find clues,
using up-to-date scientific techniques?

21
00:05:51,283 --> 00:05:55,151
Which brings me to the second course.

22
00:05:55,287 --> 00:06:00,953
There is a town upstate, two days
to the north, in the Hudson Highlands.

23
00:06:01,092 --> 00:06:05,620
It is a place called Sleepy Hollow.

24
00:06:05,764 --> 00:06:08,824
- Have you heard of it?
- I have not.

25
00:06:08,967 --> 00:06:12,095
An isolated farming community,
mainly Dutch.

26
00:06:12,704 --> 00:06:17,437
Three persons have been murdered,
all within a fortnight.

27
00:06:17,575 --> 00:06:23,207
Each one found
with the head lopped off.

28
00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:27,580
Clean as dandelion heads, apparently.

29
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:32,884
You will take your experimentations
to Sleepy Hollow, -

30
00:06:33,024 --> 00:06:36,460
- and there you will detect
the murderer.

31
00:06:36,661 --> 00:06:41,758
Bring him here to face our good justice.

32
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,802
- Will you do this?
- I shall.

33
00:06:46,571 --> 00:06:51,508
Remember,
it is you, Ichabod Crane, -

34
00:06:52,444 --> 00:06:56,437
- who is now put to the test.

35
00:12:00,084 --> 00:12:04,987
The pickety witch, the pickety witch,
who's going to kiss the pickety witch?

36
00:12:12,263 --> 00:12:15,790
- Is it Theodore?
- I am only a stranger.

37
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:19,525
Then have a kiss on account.

38
00:12:25,443 --> 00:12:28,003
I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.

39
00:12:28,746 --> 00:12:31,078
I am his daughter, Katrina.

40
00:12:31,215 --> 00:12:36,482
- We have not heard your name yet.
- I have not said it. Excuse me.

41
00:12:37,455 --> 00:12:41,391
- You need some manners!
- Brom, we'll have no raised voices.

42
00:12:41,526 --> 00:12:48,455
It is to raise spirits in this dark time
that I and my wife are giving this party.

43
00:12:48,599 --> 00:12:52,433
You are welcome,
even if you are selling something.

44
00:12:54,238 --> 00:12:59,608
Constable Ichabod Crane, sent from
New York to investigate the murders.

45
00:12:59,744 --> 00:13:03,111
Then Sleepy Hollow is grateful to you.

46
00:13:03,247 --> 00:13:07,775
We hope you will honour us
by remaining in this house.

47
00:13:08,052 --> 00:13:10,919
Come sir, we'll get you settled.
Play on!

48
00:13:17,995 --> 00:13:20,691
Excuse me.

49
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:29,101
Thank you. Please tell Mr Van Tassel
I will be down in a moment.

50
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,401
I will, sir.

51
00:13:34,245 --> 00:13:37,772
Thank God you're here.

52
00:13:46,224 --> 00:13:49,250
Ah, excellent, come in.

53
00:13:49,393 --> 00:13:51,224
Leave us, my dear.

54
00:13:55,233 --> 00:14:00,170
We are joined by Dr Thomas Lancaster,
Reverend Steenwyck, -

55
00:14:00,304 --> 00:14:02,829
- our able magistrate Samuel Philipse, -

56
00:14:02,974 --> 00:14:08,276
- and lastly, this fine fellow
is James Hardenbrook, our notary.

57
00:14:08,412 --> 00:14:13,315
- And you, sir?
- A simple farmer who has prospered.

58
00:14:13,451 --> 00:14:16,784
The town looks to me
as friend and counsel.

59
00:14:16,921 --> 00:14:19,754
And landlord and banker.
Can we proceed?

60
00:14:23,327 --> 00:14:28,629
So, three persons murdered...

61
00:14:30,601 --> 00:14:34,196
First, Peter Van Garrett...

62
00:14:34,338 --> 00:14:37,102
...and his son, Dirk Van Garrett.

63
00:14:38,109 --> 00:14:43,172
Both of them strong, capable men, -

64
00:14:43,314 --> 00:14:47,910
- found together... decapitated.

65
00:14:50,288 --> 00:14:53,815
One week later, the Widow Winship.

66
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:57,086
Also decapitated.

67
00:14:59,297 --> 00:15:03,597
Now, I will need
to ask you many questions, -

68
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:08,137
- but first let me ask,
is anyone suspected?

69
00:15:12,143 --> 00:15:16,477
How much have your superiors
explained to you?

70
00:15:16,614 --> 00:15:21,677
Only that the three were slain
in open ground, -

71
00:15:21,819 --> 00:15:25,755
- their heads found severed
from their bodies.

72
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:30,190
Their heads were not found severed.
Their heads were not found at all.

73
00:15:33,297 --> 00:15:37,063
- The heads are gone?
- Taken.

74
00:15:37,835 --> 00:15:42,829
Taken by the Headless Horseman.
Taken back to hell.

75
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:48,471
- Pardon, I don't...
- Perhaps you had better sit down.

76
00:15:51,115 --> 00:15:53,583
Yes.

77
00:15:56,354 --> 00:15:58,982
The Horseman
was a Hessian mercenary, -

78
00:15:59,123 --> 00:16:04,720
- sent by German princes to keep
Americans under the yoke of England.

79
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:09,022
But unlike his compatriots,
who came for money, -

80
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:12,829
- the Horseman came
for love of carnage.

81
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:17,600
When battle was joined,
there you'd find him.

82
00:16:19,443 --> 00:16:24,244
He rode a giant black steed
named Daredevil.

83
00:16:25,683 --> 00:16:31,588
He rode hard into battle,
chopping off heads at full gallop.

84
00:16:32,023 --> 00:16:35,254
He had filed his teeth
down to sharp points, -

85
00:16:35,393 --> 00:16:39,193
- to add to the ferocity
of his appearance.

86
00:16:46,871 --> 00:16:54,368
This butcher didn't finally reach
his end until the winter of '79.

87
00:16:54,512 --> 00:16:58,608
Not far from here,
in our western woods.

88
00:17:52,136 --> 00:17:56,129
They chopped off his head with
his own sword. Even today the woods -

89
00:17:56,273 --> 00:18:00,369
- is a haunted place,
where brave men will not venture.

90
00:18:02,513 --> 00:18:06,040
For what was planted in the ground
that day-

91
00:18:06,484 --> 00:18:09,578
- was a seed of evil.

92
00:18:11,255 --> 00:18:13,723
And so it has been for 20 years.

93
00:18:14,492 --> 00:18:20,488
But now the Hessian wakes,
cutting off heads where he finds them.

94
00:18:25,536 --> 00:18:30,132
Are you saying...
Is that what you believe?

95
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:34,205
Seeing is believing.

96
00:18:35,713 --> 00:18:40,707
They tell me you've brought books
of scientific investigation.

97
00:18:40,851 --> 00:18:44,753
This is the only book
I recommend you read.

98
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:59,667
Reverend Steenwyck, gentlemen...

99
00:19:01,405 --> 00:19:04,238
Murder needs no ghost
to come from the grave.

100
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:08,811
We have murders in New York
without benefit of ghouls and goblins.

101
00:19:09,146 --> 00:19:11,273
You're far from New York.

102
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:17,544
The assassin is a man of
flesh and blood, and I will discover him.

103
00:19:58,295 --> 00:20:00,786
Come out, devil.

104
00:20:52,249 --> 00:20:58,916
- His name's Gunpowder.
- He should do just fine. Thank you.

105
00:20:59,256 --> 00:21:02,885
Good luck, sir. You need any help,
you call my name.

106
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:08,721
Don't you worry about a thing.
Everything will be just fine.

107
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,361
Thomas, inside!

108
00:21:13,671 --> 00:21:17,698
Run along for breakfast. Kiss your
mother once for you and twice for me.

109
00:21:18,475 --> 00:21:21,137
Murder! The Horseman's killed again!

110
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,406
All right, Gunpowder, we're off.

111
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:29,610
No, no, the other way.

112
00:21:35,459 --> 00:21:37,791
Good horse.

113
00:21:48,505 --> 00:21:53,841
Mr Miller, ride back for the coffin-cart.
The rest of you, keep a sharp lookout.

114
00:21:56,614 --> 00:21:59,606
It's all right. I'm here now.

115
00:22:23,774 --> 00:22:27,505
The fourth victim, Jonathan Masbath.

116
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:34,340
I see. And the head?

117
00:22:35,686 --> 00:22:39,383
- Taken.
- Taken...

118
00:22:40,157 --> 00:22:43,285
- Interesting. Very interesting.
- What is?

119
00:22:44,395 --> 00:22:49,128
In cases like this, the head is removed
to prevent identification of the body.

120
00:22:49,266 --> 00:22:54,932
- But we know this was Masbath.
- Precisely. So why was it removed?

121
00:22:55,072 --> 00:22:57,973
- Why?
- Right.

122
00:22:59,343 --> 00:23:03,177
You have moved the body?
You must never move the body.

123
00:23:03,314 --> 00:23:07,182
- Why not?
- Because.

124
00:23:20,831 --> 00:23:24,699
The stride is gigantic!

125
00:23:25,636 --> 00:23:28,571
The attacker rode Masbath down.

126
00:23:28,939 --> 00:23:35,037
Turned his horse.
Came back to claim the head.

127
00:23:53,464 --> 00:23:57,423
There's a chemical reaction.

128
00:23:57,568 --> 00:24:01,402
It shows it was a powerful
singular thrust to the neck.

129
00:24:28,298 --> 00:24:31,995
- Interesting.
- What is it?

130
00:24:32,136 --> 00:24:38,541
The wound was cauterised,
as though the blade were red-hot.

131
00:24:38,675 --> 00:24:42,202
And yet, no blistering,
no scorched flesh.

132
00:24:44,281 --> 00:24:46,215
The Devil's fire.

133
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:58,826
"Be vigilant", as it sayeth in the
Book of Peter, chapter five, verse eight.

134
00:24:59,062 --> 00:25:05,126
"Because your adversary, the Devil,
as a roaring lion, walketh about, -

135
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:10,901
- seeking whom he may devour."
God rest, Jonathan Masbath.

136
00:25:38,702 --> 00:25:43,503
- Mr Constable, sir.
- You're young Masbath.

137
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:47,841
I was young Masbath,
but now the only one.

138
00:25:47,978 --> 00:25:53,109
Masbath at your service. In honour,
bound to avenge my father.

139
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:58,779
Well, I thank you very much, but your
mother will need you more than I.

140
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:04,784
My mother is in heaven. She has
my father now to care for her.

141
00:26:05,562 --> 00:26:09,931
But you have no one to serve you.
I am your man, sir.

142
00:26:10,067 --> 00:26:14,936
And a brave one, too. But I cannot
be the one to look after you.

143
00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:19,870
I am sorry for your loss,
young Mr Masbath.

144
00:26:31,522 --> 00:26:35,822
Constable Crane!
There's something you should know.

145
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:40,987
Jonathan Masbath was not
the fourth victim, but the fifth.

146
00:26:41,131 --> 00:26:48,162
- The fifth?
- Aye. Five victims in four graves.

147
00:26:59,349 --> 00:27:04,753
Masbath, find a place in Van Tassel's
servants' quarters. Wake me at dawn.

148
00:27:05,255 --> 00:27:07,485
I hope you have a strong stomach.

149
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,590
Peter Van Garrett, Dirk Van Garrett.

150
00:27:14,731 --> 00:27:21,295
Jonathan Masbath.
Five victims, four graves.

151
00:27:34,851 --> 00:27:38,651
The Widow Winship.

152
00:28:01,845 --> 00:28:04,507
Bring the widow in.

153
00:28:05,682 --> 00:28:10,119
- This is most irregular, Constable.
- Yes, but in this case necessary.

154
00:28:10,954 --> 00:28:15,050
- I need to operate immediately.
- Operate? She's dead.

155
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:21,229
I mean, of course,
I will need the operating table.

156
00:28:23,934 --> 00:28:27,768
Once more,
the neck wound cauterised, -

157
00:28:27,904 --> 00:28:34,537
- the sword thrust to the stomach
the same, but to what purpose?

158
00:28:34,978 --> 00:28:37,845
To what is your purpose,
is the question.

159
00:28:37,981 --> 00:28:43,180
- What type of instruments are these?
- Some of my own design.

160
00:28:44,755 --> 00:28:47,019
Step out, young Masbath.

161
00:28:47,157 --> 00:28:51,491
Thank you for your help, Mr Killian.
And if you don't mind, Doctor, -

162
00:28:51,628 --> 00:28:56,622
- my concentration suffers greatly
when I'm observed.

163
00:29:35,072 --> 00:29:38,906
- I am finished.
- What have you done to her?

164
00:29:39,042 --> 00:29:43,741
- We are dealing with a madman.
- What did you find out?

165
00:29:44,281 --> 00:29:46,977
The Widow Winship was with child.

166
00:30:32,796 --> 00:30:35,321
Who's there?

167
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:12,753
- Oh, pardon my intrusion.
- There's no intrusion.

168
00:33:12,889 --> 00:33:16,450
I come here to read when I'm wakeful.

169
00:33:20,163 --> 00:33:24,600
- To read books which you must hide.
- They were my mother's books.

170
00:33:25,101 --> 00:33:30,698
My father believes tales of romance
caused the brain fever that killed her.

171
00:33:32,242 --> 00:33:35,439
The nurse who cared for her during
her sickness is now Lady Van Tassel.

172
00:33:36,846 --> 00:33:43,376
Why did no one mention that the Van
Garretts are kin to the Van Tassels?

173
00:33:44,321 --> 00:33:49,315
Hardly a household is not connected
to every other by blood or marriage.

174
00:33:50,226 --> 00:33:52,421
I see.

175
00:33:56,666 --> 00:34:02,002
This was Van Garrett land, given to my
father when I wore swaddling clothes.

176
00:34:02,138 --> 00:34:06,370
They were the richest family around.
When my father brought me here, -

177
00:34:06,509 --> 00:34:09,307
- Van Garrett set him up with an acre
and a broken-down cottage.

178
00:34:09,446 --> 00:34:16,852
My father worked hard and prospered.
I owe Van Garrett my happiness.

179
00:34:16,987 --> 00:34:20,150
I remember living poor in the cottage.

180
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:23,750
- Should I show you?
- Yes.

181
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:32,627
- Take this. It is my gift for you.
- No, I have no use for it.

182
00:34:32,769 --> 00:34:36,466
Are you so certain of everything?

183
00:34:47,517 --> 00:34:52,352
- It was your mother's.
- It is sure protection against harm.

184
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:01,258
Are you so certain of everything?

185
00:35:15,278 --> 00:35:18,338
What are these strange markings?

186
00:35:18,615 --> 00:35:21,641
I've had them since I can remember.

187
00:35:31,594 --> 00:35:35,758
I used to play by this hearth
as a child.

188
00:35:38,034 --> 00:35:41,663
It was my first drawing school.
My mother was my teacher.

189
00:35:44,574 --> 00:35:47,873
Look. See?
Carved into the fireback.

190
00:35:48,678 --> 00:35:51,408
The archer. I'd forgotten it.

191
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:58,082
This was from long before
we lived here.

192
00:35:59,289 --> 00:36:03,419
- Are you all right?
- Yes, thank you.

193
00:36:04,661 --> 00:36:10,031
A cardinal. I'd love to have a tame one,
but I wouldn't have the heart to cage it.

194
00:36:11,601 --> 00:36:16,732
Well, then I have something for you.

195
00:36:17,874 --> 00:36:23,335
Cardinal on one side,
an empty cage. And now...

196
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:32,980
- You can do magic. Teach me.
- It is no magic. We call it "optics".

197
00:36:34,057 --> 00:36:40,724
The pictures are joined in the spinning.
Truth is not always appearance.

198
00:37:31,481 --> 00:37:35,713
What are you running from, Philipse?
You had a mind to help me.

199
00:37:35,852 --> 00:37:42,280
Yes, and it's put me in dread of powers
against which there is no defence.

200
00:37:42,425 --> 00:37:46,156
- You knew the widow was expecting?
- She told me.

201
00:37:46,296 --> 00:37:51,359
And you are not the child's father?
Did she tell you the father's name?

202
00:37:51,501 --> 00:37:56,268
Yes. She came to me for advice
as town magistrate, -

203
00:37:56,406 --> 00:38:01,400
- to protect the rights of her child.
I was bound to keep the secret.

204
00:38:01,544 --> 00:38:05,036
- Do you believe the father killed her?
- The Horseman killed her.

205
00:38:05,181 --> 00:38:10,483
There is no Horseman.
There never was. There never will be.

206
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:15,147
- What is that thing?
- My protection from the Horseman.

207
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:21,230
A magistrate, full of such nonsense!
Now tell me the name of...

208
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:43,348
Oh, my God!

209
00:39:28,097 --> 00:39:30,861
Constable Crane?

210
00:39:31,734 --> 00:39:34,635
Has he not come out at all?

211
00:39:39,342 --> 00:39:43,142
- It was a headless horseman!
- You must not excite yourself.

212
00:39:43,279 --> 00:39:49,013
- That's why you're here.
- A horseman, a dead one, headless!

213
00:39:49,152 --> 00:39:53,350
- I know.
- You don't. You weren't there. It's true!

214
00:39:53,489 --> 00:39:57,721
Of course it is.
I told you. Everyone told you.

215
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:01,352
I saw him.

216
00:40:05,668 --> 00:40:09,160
I suppose it's back to the city, then.

217
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:37,252
This time I'll go to New York myself.
I won't be fobbed off with an amateur.

218
00:41:49,572 --> 00:41:53,440
- This time, a magistrate's dead.
- Gentlemen...

219
00:41:53,576 --> 00:41:58,445
I need able men to go with me
into the western woods.

220
00:41:58,581 --> 00:42:04,076
- We thought you'd shot your bolt.
- I will find the Horseman's grave.

221
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:08,816
I will pit myself
against a murdering ghost.

222
00:42:10,059 --> 00:42:13,119
Who's with me?

223
00:42:13,262 --> 00:42:14,889
Me.

224
00:42:17,266 --> 00:42:24,229
The Van Garretts, Widow Winship,
your father, and now Philipse.

225
00:42:24,373 --> 00:42:29,310
Something must connect them. Did
your father deal with the Van Garretts?

226
00:42:29,445 --> 00:42:33,609
He worked for them.
We lived in the coach-house.

227
00:42:33,749 --> 00:42:35,774
It's nothing.

228
00:42:36,819 --> 00:42:43,019
There was an argument between father
and son a week before the murder.

229
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:45,992
My father was later sent for
by Mr Van Garrett.

230
00:42:47,997 --> 00:42:55,165
An argument between father and son.
Elder Van Garrett sent for his servant...

231
00:42:55,771 --> 00:42:58,365
Listen.

232
00:42:58,674 --> 00:43:01,370
- I hear nothing.
- Nor I.

233
00:43:01,511 --> 00:43:05,709
No birds, no crickets,
it's all gone so quiet.

234
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:16,851
Quicken pace.

235
00:44:05,575 --> 00:44:09,773
Pardon our intrusion,
but perhaps you could help us.

236
00:44:09,912 --> 00:44:14,372
- You're from the Hollow.
- In a way, yes.

237
00:44:17,787 --> 00:44:21,655
I make no assumptions
about your occupation, -

238
00:44:21,791 --> 00:44:24,783
- nor your ways,
which... which... which...

239
00:44:24,927 --> 00:44:30,559
...are nothing to me, whatever you are.
Each to his own.

240
00:44:40,543 --> 00:44:45,446
Do you know of the Horseman, ma'am?
The Hessian?

241
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:50,582
That'll be him.

242
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,712
You, come with me.

243
00:44:53,856 --> 00:44:59,158
Go out, child. Keep away.
Whatever you hear, keep away.

244
00:45:05,868 --> 00:45:09,497
What might he hear
that he must keep away from?

245
00:45:14,777 --> 00:45:21,376
He rides to the Hollow and back.
I hear him. I smell the blood on him.

246
00:45:21,917 --> 00:45:24,283
Do you?

247
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:29,380
Well, I'm here to find him
and make him stop.

248
00:45:36,332 --> 00:45:40,792
You seek knowledge
of the netherworld. I can show you.

249
00:45:48,277 --> 00:45:52,145
- What are you doing?
- Don't move or speak.

250
00:45:52,281 --> 00:45:55,546
- When the other comes, I will hold him.
- The other?

251
00:45:55,685 --> 00:45:59,815
Silence. He comes now.

252
00:46:08,197 --> 00:46:10,461
Madam...

253
00:46:12,068 --> 00:46:15,834
Madam, do you hear me?

254
00:46:26,315 --> 00:46:29,910
You seek the warrior bathed in blood,
the Headless Horseman.

255
00:46:30,252 --> 00:46:35,781
Follow the Indian trail to where
the sun dies, to the Tree of the Dead.

256
00:46:35,925 --> 00:46:41,090
Climb down
to the Horseman's resting place.

257
00:46:47,203 --> 00:46:50,536
We're leaving.
We're leaving now.

258
00:46:52,641 --> 00:46:56,304
- We go to the Tree of the Dead.
- How will we recognise it?

259
00:46:56,445 --> 00:47:00,643
Without difficulty, I fear.
Then to the Horseman's resting place.

260
00:47:00,783 --> 00:47:03,775
- His camp?
- His grave.

261
00:47:14,296 --> 00:47:16,992
Stay here.

262
00:47:53,235 --> 00:47:56,762
Halt and turn,
I have a pistol aimed!

263
00:47:57,807 --> 00:48:01,573
Katrina! I might have killed you.
Why have you come?

264
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:04,702
Because no one else
would go with you.

265
00:48:04,847 --> 00:48:10,114
Then I am now twice the man.
It is your white magic.

266
00:48:14,356 --> 00:48:19,055
Pardon my intrusion.
I think you'd better look at this.

267
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:03,568
The Tree of the Dead.

268
00:49:20,189 --> 00:49:22,282
Blood.

269
00:49:24,526 --> 00:49:26,551
Stay where you are.

270
00:50:07,136 --> 00:50:11,232
- What is it?
- Just stay where you are. Don't move.

271
00:50:27,189 --> 00:50:32,286
This tree is a gateway
between two worlds.

272
00:50:44,273 --> 00:50:49,802
This ground has been disturbed.
The soil is loose. Bring the shovel.

273
00:51:08,097 --> 00:51:12,659
The skull is gone.
Taken.

274
00:51:12,801 --> 00:51:15,770
That's why he returns from the grave.

275
00:51:15,904 --> 00:51:19,601
To take heads
until his own is restored to him.

276
00:51:37,793 --> 00:51:39,988
Ichabod?

277
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:31,576
Split up. Glenn. Theodore.

278
00:52:50,799 --> 00:52:56,066
- Don't pick your teeth, it's a bad habit.
- I am a bad habit.

279
00:52:56,205 --> 00:52:59,936
- There's nothing for it.
- Oh, isn't there?

280
00:53:18,127 --> 00:53:21,494
- Let's get ready for bed.
- Yes.

281
00:53:43,452 --> 00:53:45,352
Beth, run!

282
00:54:06,108 --> 00:54:08,542
Be quiet.

283
00:56:53,175 --> 00:56:56,633
- Wait, he's not after you.
- I'll get him.

284
00:57:16,765 --> 00:57:19,256
We cannot win this.

285
00:58:16,358 --> 00:58:19,725
Remarkable. A wound like this
should have killed him, -

286
00:58:19,861 --> 00:58:24,628
- but it needs no stitch,
and there's hardly a loss of blood.

287
00:58:24,766 --> 00:58:31,228
- You must be still. The fever is on you.
- Katrina...

288
00:58:31,373 --> 00:58:38,472
Nostradamus, Mediamus,
milk of mercy, in media nos laudamas.

289
00:58:55,263 --> 00:58:58,755
Katrina, I tried to stop Brom...

290
00:59:00,101 --> 00:59:03,696
Drink this down,
it will make you sleep.

291
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:08,071
The Horseman was not set to kill Brom
or me. Had Brom not attacked him...

292
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:10,303
Later. Rest now.

293
00:59:10,445 --> 00:59:13,881
The Horseman doesn't kill at random.

294
00:59:14,349 --> 00:59:19,810
His victims are chosen by
that very person who took his skull.

295
00:59:21,022 --> 00:59:25,925
Someone who knew where to dig,
of flesh and blood, as I've always said.

296
00:59:26,061 --> 00:59:29,258
- These are ravings.
- Drink.

297
01:00:18,547 --> 01:00:20,981
Ichabod...

298
01:00:41,403 --> 01:00:46,397
- You were dreaming.
- Yes. Of things I had forgotten...

299
01:00:50,045 --> 01:00:52,206
...and would not like to remember.

300
01:00:52,347 --> 01:00:57,046
- Tell me what you dreamt.
- My mother was an innocent.

301
01:00:57,185 --> 01:01:00,518
A child of nature.

302
01:01:00,655 --> 01:01:06,218
Condemned.
Murdered... by my father.

303
01:01:06,828 --> 01:01:10,855
- Murdered by?
- Murdered to save her soul.

304
01:01:10,999 --> 01:01:16,335
By a Bible-black tyrant,
behind a mask of righteousness.

305
01:01:16,471 --> 01:01:19,565
I was seven when I lost my faith.

306
01:01:22,143 --> 01:01:25,704
- What do you believe in?
- Sense and reason.

307
01:01:26,247 --> 01:01:28,408
Cause and consequence.

308
01:01:30,785 --> 01:01:36,121
But here my rational mind has been
so controverted by the spirit world.

309
01:01:36,925 --> 01:01:42,989
You'll take nothing from Sleepy Hollow
that was worth the coming here?

310
01:01:43,131 --> 01:01:45,759
No, not nothing.

311
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:53,865
A kiss from a lovely young woman,
before she saw me or knew my name.

312
01:01:54,509 --> 01:01:57,808
Yes, without sense or reason.

313
01:02:01,650 --> 01:02:07,885
Forgive me. I speak of kisses,
and you've lost your brave man Brom.

314
01:02:09,924 --> 01:02:12,859
I have shed my tears for Brom, -

315
01:02:12,994 --> 01:02:18,227
- and yet my heart is not broken.
Do you think me wicked?

316
01:02:19,367 --> 01:02:24,930
No. But perhaps
there is a bit of witch in you.

317
01:02:26,107 --> 01:02:30,009
- Why do you say that?
- Because you've bewitched me.

318
01:02:45,326 --> 01:02:47,317
You slept like the dead.

319
01:02:47,462 --> 01:02:51,831
You're too kind to me. I don't look
to be served by the lady of the house.

320
01:02:51,966 --> 01:02:56,164
Nor would you be,
but that the servant girl has vanished.

321
01:02:56,304 --> 01:03:00,001
- Sarah?
- Run away, like so many others.

322
01:03:00,975 --> 01:03:03,773
They're all leaving in fear.

323
01:03:04,612 --> 01:03:06,705
Where is Katrina?

324
01:03:06,848 --> 01:03:10,841
She watched over you till dawn.
Now it is her turn to sleep.

325
01:03:18,059 --> 01:03:20,892
I'm fit for another day, I think.

326
01:03:22,197 --> 01:03:23,755
Fit enough to face a mortal adversary.

327
01:03:27,168 --> 01:03:31,070
Dr. Lancaster.
Reverend Steenwyck.

328
01:03:33,975 --> 01:03:38,878
Notary Hardenbrook
and Magistrate Philipse...

329
01:03:40,348 --> 01:03:43,806
...who tried to cut and run,
and lost his head.

330
01:03:43,952 --> 01:03:49,720
Four frightened men arguing together
on the very night Philipse was killed.

331
01:03:51,392 --> 01:03:53,917
There is conspiracy here.

332
01:03:57,999 --> 01:04:02,766
The doctor, the reverend,
the notary and the magistrate.

333
01:04:05,406 --> 01:04:09,069
What is the secret that unites them?

334
01:04:11,379 --> 01:04:15,782
Magistrate Philipse knew
there were five bodies to four graves.

335
01:04:15,917 --> 01:04:21,014
He knew the widow was pregnant and
would not tell me the father's name.

336
01:04:22,724 --> 01:04:26,455
What does this point to?

337
01:04:32,367 --> 01:04:35,666
We must proceed
by process of elimination.

338
01:04:35,804 --> 01:04:42,073
I'll list everyone in town, starting with
its chief citizen, Baltus Van Tassel.

339
01:04:45,213 --> 01:04:48,546
- I feel we're getting very close.
- Yes...

340
01:04:48,683 --> 01:04:54,781
I suppose Baltus is the chief citizen,
now that old Van Garrett is dead.

341
01:04:54,923 --> 01:04:59,257
The Van Garretts...
I'd almost forgotten them.

342
01:05:10,104 --> 01:05:13,699
Come with me,
to Notary Hardenbrook's.

343
01:05:13,842 --> 01:05:19,747
- Have you thought of something?
- Yes... I have.

344
01:05:34,329 --> 01:05:35,591
Hopeless.

345
01:05:44,539 --> 01:05:48,669
My father's satchel.
Why is it here?

346
01:05:53,381 --> 01:05:57,249
- Leave me alone.
- Notary Hardenbrook...

347
01:05:57,385 --> 01:06:01,185
Show me the last will and testament
of old man Van Garrett.

348
01:06:01,656 --> 01:06:05,956
- The will leaves everything to his son.
- Who died with him.

349
01:06:06,094 --> 01:06:11,555
- The estate passes to the next of kin.
- Naturally. All legal and above board.

350
01:06:12,233 --> 01:06:18,035
- Sir?
- I'm a dead man. No...

351
01:06:19,674 --> 01:06:22,404
Van Garrett's seal, broken.

352
01:06:25,113 --> 01:06:32,576
He made a new will just before he died,
naming... Widow Winship?

353
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:37,748
And here, look.
A marriage certificate.

354
01:06:38,459 --> 01:06:44,557
He secretly married the widow and left
everything to her and her unborn child.

355
01:06:45,166 --> 01:06:50,763
It stood between Van Garrett's fortune
and the one who'd have got everything.

356
01:06:50,905 --> 01:06:56,104
It's true, but we four
were drawn in against our will.

357
01:06:56,678 --> 01:06:58,737
- Your will?
- He means...

358
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:03,714
Of course, the four town elders.

359
01:07:03,851 --> 01:07:08,948
Now I see what parts you had to play.
Steenwyck knew the secret.

360
01:07:09,090 --> 01:07:14,084
He performed the marriage. Lancaster
attended the pregnant woman.

361
01:07:14,228 --> 01:07:20,360
Philipse gave protection of the law.
Hardenbrook concealed documents -

362
01:07:20,501 --> 01:07:23,800
- entrusted by Van Garrett
to his faithful servant.

363
01:07:23,938 --> 01:07:30,104
- The conspirators drawn into the plot.
- We knew not it was a murdering plot.

364
01:07:30,244 --> 01:07:32,405
But I have not finished, sir.

365
01:07:32,547 --> 01:07:37,917
First, the Van Garretts slain by
a horseman raised from the grave.

366
01:07:38,052 --> 01:07:42,113
Up pops a widow with a claim
on the fortune. Off with her head.

367
01:07:42,590 --> 01:07:46,890
But murder begets murder.
It was the servant...

368
01:07:47,028 --> 01:07:51,692
...Jonathan Masbath. The night father
and son quarrelled over the new will.

369
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:56,368
Masbath was summoned upstairs
to bear witness.

370
01:07:56,504 --> 01:08:00,964
Here is his signature.
I'm afraid it was his death warrant.

371
01:08:01,109 --> 01:08:05,409
The Horseman came for him.
Came for him -

372
01:08:05,546 --> 01:08:10,643
- at the bidding of someone who had
power over him, who dug in the earth -

373
01:08:10,785 --> 01:08:16,849
- and stole the skull, which must again
be his before he will return to hell.

374
01:08:16,991 --> 01:08:21,121
Someone who stood to gain
or lose a fortune. None other -

375
01:08:21,262 --> 01:08:25,631
- than Van Garrett's next of kin,
Baltus Van Tassel!

376
01:08:31,606 --> 01:08:35,702
- Katrina, why are you in my room?
- Because it is yours.

377
01:08:39,947 --> 01:08:44,748
- Was it wicked of me?
- No, not at all.

378
01:08:45,987 --> 01:08:51,186
- I missed you. Where did you go?
- I had questions to ask Hardenbrook.

379
01:08:51,325 --> 01:08:57,286
- Did you learn anything of interest?
- Perhaps.

380
01:08:58,332 --> 01:09:00,323
- My father...
- Your father?

381
01:09:00,468 --> 01:09:04,234
Yes. My father thinks
you should return to New York.

382
01:09:04,372 --> 01:09:07,671
Really? Why is that?

383
01:09:08,443 --> 01:09:13,005
I don't know. Perhaps he looked in your
ledger and did not like what he saw.

384
01:09:19,387 --> 01:09:23,551
- What have you there?
- Evidence. I'm sorry, I must ask you...

385
01:09:23,691 --> 01:09:27,388
Then I'll leave you to your thoughts.

386
01:09:39,974 --> 01:09:42,738
- It's just a spider.
- Kill it!

387
01:09:42,877 --> 01:09:48,338
- No, stop it!
- There's something under here.

388
01:09:48,483 --> 01:09:52,579
- What is it?
- Help me move the bed.

389
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:55,553
No, I mustn't. You do it.

390
01:10:01,596 --> 01:10:07,933
The evil eye. It is someone
casting spells against you.

391
01:10:08,069 --> 01:10:11,527
The evil eye...

392
01:11:00,855 --> 01:11:03,585
Wait here.

393
01:12:17,965 --> 01:12:20,229
Katrina...

394
01:12:21,736 --> 01:12:25,502
- You took the evidence and burned it.
- So it would not accuse my father.

395
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:31,237
I accuse no one. But if there is guilt,
I cannot alter it, even if it grieves me.

396
01:12:31,379 --> 01:12:37,875
No spells of yours can alter it, either.
It is he who profits from these murders.

397
01:12:38,019 --> 01:12:41,785
If you knew him, you'd not have
such harsh thoughts about him.

398
01:12:41,922 --> 01:12:48,020
- Nor if you felt anything for me.
- Why did his friends conceal?

399
01:12:48,162 --> 01:12:52,360
You are the constable. Find another
chain of reasoning and let me be.

400
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:57,301
I cannot. Nor the one or the other.
And I am heartsick with it.

401
01:12:57,438 --> 01:13:02,137
I think you have no heart,
and I had a mind once to give you mine.

402
01:13:03,577 --> 01:13:06,774
Yes, I think you loved me -

403
01:13:06,914 --> 01:13:10,372
- when you followed me into the woods.
To have braved such peril.

404
01:13:10,518 --> 01:13:16,320
What peril was there if it was my own
father who controlled the Horseman?

405
01:13:20,094 --> 01:13:24,053
Goodbye, Ichabod Crane. I curse
the day you came to Sleepy Hollow.

406
01:13:29,337 --> 01:13:34,206
- She will not see you.
- Did she say anything?

407
01:13:36,177 --> 01:13:39,544
Only that she will not come down.

408
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:43,810
- I see. Thank you.
- Constable...

409
01:13:45,286 --> 01:13:49,814
You have not asked me
how I hurt my hand since yesterday, -

410
01:13:49,957 --> 01:13:53,393
- which would have been polite.

411
01:13:53,527 --> 01:13:59,932
In fact, you have been as careful
not to look at it as not to mention it.

412
01:14:01,469 --> 01:14:06,634
- Yes, I'm sorry. How did you?
- I know you saw me.

413
01:14:06,774 --> 01:14:11,438
- What?
- I know you followed last night.

414
01:14:11,579 --> 01:14:16,710
You must promise not to tell my
husband what you saw. Promise me!

415
01:14:17,818 --> 01:14:22,380
The town is in ferment! Horror
piled on tragedy. Hardenbrook is dead!

416
01:14:22,523 --> 01:14:26,653
- That harmless old man?
- Hanged himself in the night.

417
01:14:26,794 --> 01:14:29,922
- Hanged himself?
- There's a church meeting tonight.

418
01:14:30,064 --> 01:14:35,024
Everyone is going to speak out
against you. If you are wise, -

419
01:14:35,169 --> 01:14:39,697
- you will leave this place.
What is that?

420
01:14:40,274 --> 01:14:44,301
- I was careless with the kitchen knife.
- The wound looks angry.

421
01:14:44,445 --> 01:14:48,973
I will bind it with arrowroot flowers.
I know where some grow.

422
01:15:00,294 --> 01:15:03,889
Hurry up,
the meeting bell has started tolling.

423
01:15:27,621 --> 01:15:34,220
The Horseman!
Katrina, the Horseman saved me!

424
01:15:36,330 --> 01:15:39,891
The Horseman killed your stepmother!

425
01:15:48,709 --> 01:15:50,267
Oh, God!

426
01:16:20,441 --> 01:16:25,071
You'll kill us all!
You're the one the Horseman wants!

427
01:16:44,798 --> 01:16:46,789
He cannot enter.

428
01:16:56,577 --> 01:17:01,310
The Horseman cannot enter!
He cannot cross the gate.

429
01:17:01,448 --> 01:17:04,975
We have to save ourselves.

430
01:17:05,119 --> 01:17:08,111
The next person to lay a hand on me
will get a bullet!

431
01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:12,458
He's coming back!

432
01:17:19,099 --> 01:17:23,559
- Enough have died. It's time to confess.
- What is it that you know?

433
01:17:23,704 --> 01:17:28,698
Your four friends played you false.
We were possessed by one who...

434
01:17:38,419 --> 01:17:40,353
Stay back!

435
01:17:58,572 --> 01:18:01,700
There's a conspiracy here,
and I will seek it out!

436
01:19:18,252 --> 01:19:21,415
It was an evil spirit possessed you.

437
01:19:21,555 --> 01:19:27,016
I pray it is satisfied and that you find
peace. The evil eye has done its work.

438
01:19:27,161 --> 01:19:31,621
My life is over. Spared for
a lifetime of horrors in my sleep.

439
01:19:32,766 --> 01:19:35,758
Waking each day to grief.

440
01:19:41,141 --> 01:19:44,110
Goodbye, Katrina.

441
01:20:21,048 --> 01:20:25,178
- You think it was Katrina, don't you?
- That can never be uttered.

442
01:20:25,319 --> 01:20:28,618
A strange sort of witch,
with a kind and loving heart.

443
01:20:28,756 --> 01:20:31,122
- How can you think so?
- I have good reason.

444
01:20:31,258 --> 01:20:35,194
- Then you are bewitched by reason.
- And beaten down by it!

445
01:20:40,033 --> 01:20:43,935
It is a hard lesson for a hard world.
You'd better learn it.

446
01:20:44,071 --> 01:20:50,032
Villainy wears many masks. None
so dangerous as the mask of virtue.

447
01:20:57,251 --> 01:20:59,344
Farewell.

448
01:22:28,542 --> 01:22:31,943
Return the coach! Turn around now!

449
01:22:45,259 --> 01:22:47,750
Pardon my intrusion.

450
01:22:57,304 --> 01:23:02,469
No blood flow,
no clotting, no healing.

451
01:23:04,144 --> 01:23:08,137
When this cut was made,
this woman was already dead.

452
01:23:18,625 --> 01:23:21,150
Dear stepdaughter.

453
01:23:22,596 --> 01:23:25,827
You look as if you'd seen a ghost.

454
01:23:56,430 --> 01:24:02,630
Rise up once more, my dark avenger.
One more night of beheading.

455
01:24:03,170 --> 01:24:05,297
Rise up with your sword.

456
01:24:05,672 --> 01:24:09,506
A head for a head.

457
01:24:09,643 --> 01:24:12,635
My unholy horseman, rise.

458
01:24:12,779 --> 01:24:17,375
Come now for Katrina.

459
01:24:30,797 --> 01:24:33,357
Awake at last.

460
01:24:33,734 --> 01:24:38,228
- You thought it was all a nasty dream?
- Father saw the Horseman kill you.

461
01:24:39,039 --> 01:24:42,702
He saw the Horseman come toward
me with his sword unsheathed, -

462
01:24:43,343 --> 01:24:49,509
- but it is I who govern the Horseman,
dear, and Baltus did not stay to watch.

463
01:24:54,221 --> 01:24:57,486
- But there was a body.
- The servant girl, Sarah.

464
01:24:57,624 --> 01:25:00,684
I always thought she was useless...

465
01:25:03,563 --> 01:25:06,327
...but she had a purpose after all.

466
01:25:11,571 --> 01:25:17,100
- Who are you?
- My family name was Archer.

467
01:25:17,244 --> 01:25:20,236
The archer?

468
01:25:25,385 --> 01:25:29,788
I lived with my father, mother and sister
in a cottage not far from here.

469
01:25:29,923 --> 01:25:37,125
My father died, and the landlord, whom
we'd served faithfully, evicted us.

470
01:25:37,998 --> 01:25:44,028
No one would take us in, because my
mother was suspected of witchcraft.

471
01:25:44,171 --> 01:25:48,835
She schooled her daughters well, while
we lived as outcasts in the woods.

472
01:25:50,110 --> 01:25:52,578
She died within a year.

473
01:25:57,484 --> 01:26:03,081
My sister and I remained in our refuge,
seeing not a soul.

474
01:26:03,223 --> 01:26:09,753
Until one day, gathering firewood,
we crossed the path of the Hessian.

475
01:26:15,135 --> 01:26:21,506
I saw his death. At that moment,
I offered my soul to Satan, -

476
01:26:21,641 --> 01:26:27,238
- if he would raise the Hessian
from the grave to avenge me.

477
01:26:30,617 --> 01:26:33,780
- Avenge you?
- Against Van Garrett!

478
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:37,219
The landlord who showed us no mercy
and left us to starve, -

479
01:26:37,357 --> 01:26:42,351
- whilst Baltus and his simpering wife
and girl child stole our home.

480
01:26:42,496 --> 01:26:45,863
I'd make myself mistress of all he had.

481
01:26:45,999 --> 01:26:50,595
The easiest was to enter your house
as your mother's sick-nurse, -

482
01:26:50,770 --> 01:26:54,934
- and put her body into the grave,
and my own into the marriage bed.

483
01:26:55,075 --> 01:27:02,311
Not quite so easy was to secure
my legacy. The widow had to go, -

484
01:27:02,449 --> 01:27:08,410
- and the servant Masbath. Just the
other day, that silly midwife Killian -

485
01:27:08,555 --> 01:27:11,752
- told me the widow
had told her a big secret.

486
01:27:11,892 --> 01:27:16,852
And she told me this right in front
of her husband! What a goose!

487
01:27:17,230 --> 01:27:21,826
So, another little job for the Horseman.

488
01:27:23,336 --> 01:27:29,673
But lust delivered
the Rev. Steenwyck into my power.

489
01:27:29,809 --> 01:27:34,872
Fear did the same for Hardenbrook
and the drunkard Philipse.

490
01:27:35,015 --> 01:27:38,712
And the doctor's silence I exchanged
for my complicity -

491
01:27:38,852 --> 01:27:43,118
- in his fornications
with the servant girl Sarah.

492
01:27:43,256 --> 01:27:49,024
- Yes, you have everything now.
- No, you have, my dear.

493
01:27:49,162 --> 01:27:54,600
By your father's will. I get everything
in the event of your death.

494
01:27:56,069 --> 01:28:01,132
Oh, my sister, by the way,
sadly passed away.

495
01:28:03,376 --> 01:28:06,004
Quite recently.

496
01:28:07,347 --> 01:28:12,080
- You killed your own sister.
- She brought it on herself.

497
01:28:12,219 --> 01:28:15,086
By helping you and your master!

498
01:28:16,156 --> 01:28:19,489
You're just in time
to have your head cut off.

499
01:28:19,626 --> 01:28:23,187
Tonight the Horseman comes for you!

500
01:28:29,869 --> 01:28:32,030
Katrina!

501
01:28:37,577 --> 01:28:39,306
Thank God.

502
01:28:47,887 --> 01:28:49,980
Watch your head.

503
01:29:05,505 --> 01:29:07,996
To the roof. I have an idea.

504
01:30:07,634 --> 01:30:09,829
Jump in the sails!

505
01:30:24,651 --> 01:30:26,915
Jump!

506
01:30:31,458 --> 01:30:33,289
Hurry!

507
01:30:52,779 --> 01:30:56,579
- Is he dead?
- He was dead to begin with.

508
01:31:20,573 --> 01:31:23,599
- Where are we going?
- Anywhere but here.

509
01:31:36,089 --> 01:31:38,387
Take the reins.

510
01:32:55,335 --> 01:32:57,132
My bag!

511
01:33:14,287 --> 01:33:15,720
Jump!

512
01:34:18,785 --> 01:34:21,413
- Still alive?
- Run, Katrina.

513
01:34:21,988 --> 01:34:25,924
Yes, do run and jump and skip.

514
01:34:37,870 --> 01:34:43,399
Here, take her! She's yours!

515
01:34:46,913 --> 01:34:50,349
Sir, you're not dead!

516
01:35:31,190 --> 01:35:33,317
Horseman!

517
01:39:05,271 --> 01:39:08,035
Just in time for a new century.

518
01:39:20,319 --> 01:39:22,310
You'll soon get your bearings,
young Masbath.

519
01:39:22,455 --> 01:39:27,859
The Bronx is up, the Battery's down,
and home is this way.
