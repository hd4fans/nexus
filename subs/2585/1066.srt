1
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,110
When?

2
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,070
Today.

3
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,580
Yeah, when today?

4
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,640
Please. I'll tell him.

5
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,890
Hey, kids, how we doing?

6
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,360
We're good. Good.

7
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,500
And I wasn't trying to surprise you.

8
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,600
We weren't really surprised, sir.

9
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:12,010
Christian, do you think it's possible for you to stop calling me "sir"?

10
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,170
I really feel old when you do that.

11
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,950
You know, I thought we had an agreement here.

12
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,810
Dad, we're just sitting. People sit.

13
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,450
Look, honey, I'm not trying to give you guys a hard time...

14
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,490
...but we have discussed this, you know?

15
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,190
Technically, you're under my roof still...

16
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,260
...and I don't feel comfortable with the two of you in here...

17
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:37,730
Stop. Have you seen the size of this boat?

18
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,130
Don't you think we could find a zillion places...

19
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,640
...to do that thing you think we wanna do if we wanted?

20
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,240
Jennifer, I'm simply saying...

21
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:49,710
No. I'm over your patronizing tone, okay? I'm really over it.

22
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,750
Hey, is she like this with you?

23
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,220
- I'm sorry. - No, excuse me.

24
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,620
I'm trying to find the galley.

25
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,760
I think it's off-limits to guests.

26
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,620
Not so much of a rules person.

27
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:46,200
- It's quite a lobby, isn't it? - Yeah.

28
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,570
This the first time you've been through here?

29
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,710
So I guess you missed the tour, then, huh?

30
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:56,640
But you had to come through here when we boarded. Didn't you?

31
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,750
Through that door is a service corridor. Take a left, all the way to the end.

32
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,060
Hi, it's me.

33
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:17,690
Could you call me? Please?

34
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:24,710
I'm actually begging, aren't I?

35
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:30,110
I'd like you to call me at midnight.

36
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,110
You know, for old times' sake.

37
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,480
Bye.

38
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,450
Baby, baby, baby...

39
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,690
Hey. You were supposed to stay inside. That was the deal.

40
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,030
The TV isn't working. I'm cramped. I'm going crazy in there.

41
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,260
Come here, come here, come here.

42
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,210
Coming through.

43
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,670
It's just, Elena...

44
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,840
...I could lose my job for this, you know? - It's not that I'm not grateful, Valentin.

45
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,380
I'm just... I'm so bored.

46
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,910
- You hungry? You must be hungry. - I'm starving.

47
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,960
Now, Elena, listen.

48
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:18,120
Look at me. Promise me you will not come out again.

49
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,480
The ocean has always been the cradle of rebirth.

50
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,140
Since man first emerged from these salty depths...

51
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,520
...we have looked to water as a chance to begin anew.

52
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,490
Poseidon was the god of the sea.

53
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:51,320
He made his home on the ocean floor in a palace of coral and gems.

54
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,520
And so, what better way to celebrate the birth of a new year...

55
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,130
...than borne on the back of the old fellow himself?

56
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,000
May you all have clear sailing in the new year...

57
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,110
...and all the years to come.

58
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:09,780
Ladies and gentlemen, the incomparable Gloria!

59
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,480
- Five thousand. - Five thousand to call.

60
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,380
Goddamn, boy.

61
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,890
You got some mighty big ones on you.

62
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,760
- Hey, honey. - Yes, sir.

63
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:01,730
Get Lucky Larry another drink, would you? Martini. Okay, babe?

64
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,400
- There's blood in the water tonight. - Five thousand to call, sir.

65
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:09,510
You know, I think there's more money in that pot than my old man made in a year.

66
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,830
Five, and 10.

67
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,000
Fifteen to call.

68
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,670
Happiest time of my life is when I was broke.

69
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,910
Make it 20.

70
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,680
Let's make it 20, and let's make it 40.

71
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,290
You miss being mayor?

72
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,650
Do you ever win?

73
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,260
Forty more to you, sir.

74
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,530
Goddamn, this is getting good.

75
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,300
- Dad. We're going downstairs. - Hello, sweetie. Have fun.

76
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,940
- Hey, Jen. - What?

77
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,040
Come on.

78
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,940
I can see, you know.

79
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,540
The twins? Dad.

80
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:51,270
Can you just? One more button, please?

81
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,480
Pair of fives, huh, Dad?

82
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,790
Oh, God.

83
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,830
All in.

84
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,030
I'll fold.

85
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,660
- Oh, hey, kid, you all right? - Yeah, I'm sorry.

86
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:43,930
- How much for the game? - I don't know, what's it worth to you?

87
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,570
You were minding your own business and those chips...

88
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,940
...jumped out in front of you. - I wasn't watching where I was going.

89
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,510
Come on, sweetheart, let's go.

90
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,840
- Sorry about that. - Not a problem.

91
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:58,470
Guess what. Your friend the captain wants you to blow the New Year's horn.

92
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,210
No way! Mom?

93
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,510
Go. Conor?

94
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,910
Thanks, sorry, bye!

95
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,820
- Great kid. - Yeah, he is. Still amazes me, actually.

96
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:12,430
So the captain's table? That's a nice place to spend New Year's Eve.

97
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,220
Does your husband...?

98
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,890
- That work much? - What?

99
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,860
The tentative mention of a husband I'm supposed to correct...

100
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,130
...even though you clocked my wedding finger twice already?

101
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,570
It usually works better than that, yeah.

102
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,840
Normally what you get on these cruise ships...

103
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:33,580
...is your desperate single woman hoping to meet a guy, and you sure don't fit the bill.

104
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,880
That's not actually supposed to generate a thank-you, was it?

105
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,820
Maggie James.

106
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,480
Dylan.

107
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,500
- What do you do, Mr. Dylan? - First name.

108
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,860
Well, somebody's gonna drink too much...

109
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,500
...and get into a fight with their wife or husband...

110
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,200
...and come up here and start buying chips in a frenzy.

111
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,540
Any night, but particularly tonight.

112
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,440
And I take their money. That's what I do.

113
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,310
Professionally.

114
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,140
That supposed to be sexy?

115
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,750
Depends. Was it?

116
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,150
Nice to meet you, first name Dylan.

117
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,250
Come on. That's right.

118
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,100
Decided, sir?

119
00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:01,330
We will have the Romanee-conti, 1988, please.

120
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,260
Very well, sir.

121
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,970
- Nelson... - My treat.

122
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,200
That's a five-thousand-dollar bottle of wine.

123
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,070
Carpe diem, my friend.

124
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,910
Carpe diem.

125
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,490
There was no work crisis.

126
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,920
What do you mean?

127
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,530
I'm sorry, I lied.

128
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,360
Apparently...

129
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:31,730
...the one who really missed the boat in London was me.

130
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,970
He's met someone.

131
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:38,840
He didn't mean to hurt me.

132
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:42,450
He never thought that this would happen to him.

133
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:47,240
I'm sure that you know this whole song, so I don't have to sing it for you.

134
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,050
I think I'll get some air.

135
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,050
And then we'll have some wine.

136
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,930
Lots and lots of wine.

137
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,990
Quiet. Quiet.

138
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,260
Gentlemen, keep it down.

139
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,430
Do you feel that?

140
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,540
Something's off.

141
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,980
Here we go!

142
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:21,110
Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven!

143
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:26,220
Six! Five! Four! Three! Two! One!

144
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,220
Happy New Year!

145
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,490
Happy New Year!

146
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,290
Happy New Year.

147
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,340
Happy New Year!

148
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,030
You have no messages.

149
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,350
No.

150
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,030
No.

151
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:39,460
Hard to starboard! Starboard engines, full astern!

152
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:43,360
- Starboard engines, full astern! - I got it, I got it! Come on.

153
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:46,030
Turn. Turn!

154
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,020
Turn!

155
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,590
Come on. Come on, come on!

156
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,500
- Bow thrusters! - Full to starboard!

157
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,200
Sounding general alarm.

158
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:32,910
All crew, report immediately to your emergency stations.

159
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:38,520
This is not a drill. All passengers, brace for immediate and heavy rolls.

160
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,430
Stay there. I'm coming, baby!

161
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,020
Just stay there! Wait for me!

162
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,290
Fire, life and safety crews, proceed to your muster stations immediately.

163
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,060
This is not a drill.

164
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,340
Help me!

165
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,780
Stay calm!

166
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,060
Conor?

167
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:40,590
Oh, my God.

168
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,490
Conor!

169
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,650
Chris.

170
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,450
Christian.

171
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,660
Christian!

172
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,090
Are you okay?

173
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,270
Hey.

174
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,740
My leg's pinned.

175
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,300
Come on.

176
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,140
Help. Somebody. Please, please.

177
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,840
Please, help me. I can't lift this by myself.

178
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,920
- Please help me. Please. - Okay.

179
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,620
On three.

180
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,490
One, two, three.

181
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,290
Again. One, two, three.

182
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,130
Conor!

183
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,500
Everyone, remain calm. Remain calm.

184
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,340
Hey, lady. Up there.

185
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,900
Hey! We need some help over here.

186
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,410
Scootch back from the edge! Be careful!

187
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,670
- Grab the side of that. - Okay.

188
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,440
- Conor! - Come here. Grab the other side of that.

189
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,680
You're okay!

190
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,980
- His name conor? - Yeah.

191
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,720
All right, conor, I want you to jump into this curtain.

192
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:18,380
What are you doing?

193
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,620
I used to be a fireman. We're gonna get him down safe and sound.

194
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:25,570
You'll be all right, conor. Come on, kid.

195
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,500
Jump! Right now!

196
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,370
Sweetie.

197
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,280
Everything's okay.

198
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,110
Move this thing.

199
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,180
We need something to leverage this.

200
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,990
No.

201
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,630
I'll go.

202
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,500
It's just dead people, right?

203
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,490
- Baby, stay here. - I'm here.

204
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:36,470
- Stay with me. - We're gonna be okay.

205
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,800
Now, we're not sure exactly what happened here, but our best guess...

206
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:45,510
...is that we were struck by what is known as a rogue wave.

207
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,140
They're rare. They're unpredictable. And they are lethal.

208
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,350
Now the good news.

209
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,250
The instant this ship was struck...

210
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:57,950
...emergency GPS locator beacons were launched...

211
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:02,000
...so we are, at most, several hours from rescue.

212
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:04,070
- Are we sinking? - How do we get out?

213
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,460
Please. Do yourself a favor.

214
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,910
Follow the directions of my officers and stay calm.

215
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:17,040
This room is a giant air bubble holding up the ship.

216
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,880
Once these bulkhead doors are sealed...

217
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:23,540
...we'll be safe from gas leaks, fire and flooding.

218
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,290
We will be safe.

219
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,770
What are you doing?

220
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,180
I'm getting out of here.

221
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,620
Where are you going?

222
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,620
I'm going up. And out through the bottom.

223
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,450
Wait. How are you gonna get out of the bottom of the boat?

224
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:06,100
That's the part that's all sealed up.

225
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,460
She was in the nightclub.

226
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:10,400
We have people there. I'm confident they're dealing with it.

227
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:14,560
You're confident? You can't reach them, can you? I mean, what if they're dead?

228
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,970
Then your daughter's dead too, and leaving this room won't help.

229
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,540
Half the people here have families somewhere onboard.

230
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,080
You know disaster scenarios.

231
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:25,510
These folks start climbing over each other trying to search the ship...

232
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,520
...they're gonna get killed. - How do I get up there, captain?

233
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:30,880
- I'm sorry, but you need to stay here. - How...?

234
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:34,460
- You may not leave this ballroom. - Excuse me?

235
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,490
I'm within my authority to compel you to stay.

236
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,650
Captain, I understand you have no choice.

237
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,800
There's sick and injured people here. You need to stay with them.

238
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,700
But I am going to find my daughter...

239
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:48,330
...and don't for one second think you can stop me.

240
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,670
Dylan. What did you say to him?

241
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:58,040
Mom, there's holes at the bottom of the ship with propellers in them.

242
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,980
You can't get out that way, sweetie. Please tell him you can't.

243
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,920
Will you please take me and my mom?

244
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:05,680
Oh, Jesus.

245
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,150
Tell him you can't. Please.

246
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,660
But I can.

247
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:12,320
You think you can get us off this boat safely?

248
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,330
What? Us? No.

249
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,430
Hey. We're going out through the bow thrusters.

250
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,500
Captain's saying we should stay here.

251
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:24,330
I wouldn't put a lot of faith in what the captain has to say. I'm an architect.

252
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:28,140
These ships weren't designed to stay afloat upside down.

253
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,370
You know this ship?

254
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,510
- I know ships. - Know where the disco is?

255
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,480
It's one story down, which is now up.

256
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:36,450
- Suddenly in the mood to go dancing? - My daughter's in there.

257
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,420
Dylan, listen to me. Hey, Dylan, wait.

258
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,920
Let's stick together here. We'll get my daughter...

259
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:44,890
...then we help each other find a way out. - Look, man, I work better on my own.

260
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,790
- No offense. - None taken.

261
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,360
So where's the nearest vertical access?

262
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:50,960
I'll know when I find it.

263
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,170
- Hey, hey. You work here, right? - Yeah.

264
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,830
Where's the nearest vertical access?

265
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:59,670
Service stairs, like, in the galley.

266
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,040
Whatever you earn in a year, I'll double it if you take us there now.

267
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:05,680
Done.

268
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:08,480
You got a plan, and now we got a map.

269
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:12,050
- Lf you're coming, keep up. - Let's go.

270
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,430
Hey, Mom, are we going with them?

271
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,250
Yeah, baby, let's go.

272
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,650
Ramsey!

273
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:43,790
You know we have to seal the bulkhead doors.

274
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:47,460
- Seal the doors. - Yes, sir.

275
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,700
Don't touch anything, sweetie.

276
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:14,780
I know it's been a while, God, and I've been out of touch...

277
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:18,940
...but please, please, please be with me.

278
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,650
Be with me. Be with me.

279
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:41,500
What the hell did you go and do to all these people?

280
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,680
Cover your face, honey.

281
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,440
- Those are the service stairs, right? - Yeah, behind this.

282
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,280
Damn it.

283
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,320
People, we got a problem.

284
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,150
Hey. Hey, map. What's through here?

285
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:01,160
Yeah. That's the... That's the service elevator.

286
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:04,260
We're gonna get through this. Let's go.

287
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:08,330
Find something we can pry it with.

288
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,030
All right. What's through there? Is there a way up?

289
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,290
- More stairs. - More stairs. Okay, let's find something.

290
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:49,410
Careful. Careful. All right.

291
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,670
- Okay, get the front up. - I got it.

292
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,910
Ready? One, two, three.

293
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,580
- Shit. Pick it up. - Hold it!

294
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,220
- Don't let it rock. - Easy.

295
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:15,830
I can't get leverage.

296
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,500
Hey, what if we go through up there?

297
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,410
The entertainment section's up there.

298
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,910
- Come give me a hand. - We'll hold it steady. You'll be all right.

299
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,410
It's okay. Come on.

300
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,570
- Go. - Come on.

301
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,350
Okay. Now put your back up against this wall. Come on.

302
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:43,130
- Good. - Hurry, hurry!

303
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,270
- Now give me a stirrup. - Okay, okay.

304
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,940
Go up.

305
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,480
It's okay! Honey.

306
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,790
Okay. Send the kid. Come on.

307
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,450
Don't look down.

308
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,990
- Come on. All right. - That's it. Don't look down, honey.

309
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,000
- It's okay. - It's okay, son.

310
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,900
- That's it, that's it. Look, look. - That's good.

311
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,670
That's it!

312
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,400
Excellent. Put your hands up.

313
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,370
Reach your hands up to me.

314
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,170
Up!

315
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,980
Gotcha.

316
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,410
- Good boy! - Okay. Come on, Maggie.

317
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:39,760
Come on. Keep coming.

318
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:41,850
Good.

319
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:45,720
Okay, up. One, two, three.

320
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,030
Okay. I got this.

321
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,670
Damn it.

322
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,510
Hold on, hold on!

323
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:13,290
- Thank you, gorgeous. - My name's Valentin.

324
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:17,290
Valentin. I love that name.

325
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:21,790
You... You go first.

326
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:24,020
- Come on. - You go first!

327
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:30,340
- Come on, give me your hand. - Give me your foot. Give me your foot.

328
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,600
I gotcha.

329
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:38,870
Hang on!

330
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,680
He's gonna take them both down.

331
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,490
- Stay back, sweetie. - I'm gonna anchor us. Hold onto him!

332
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,960
Help me up!

333
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,890
- It's okay. - Come on!

334
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,560
Help me up!

335
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,670
Give me one of my hands.

336
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,440
I'm losing him.

337
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,680
Shake him off.

338
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,120
Shake him off!

339
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,920
- Now, or you both die! - No!

340
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:25,820
I'm so sorry.

341
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,430
Shake him off! Now!

342
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:33,800
No! No! No!

343
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,420
Come on!

344
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,890
- Captain. - That felt like the galley.

345
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,790
Gas shutoffs must have malfunctioned.

346
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,990
The door seals, will they keep the fire out?

347
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,460
- Yes, captain. - Help! Somebody, over here.

348
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,630
God rest their souls.

349
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:30,580
I'll take a look.

350
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:58,280
Come on, I think I found a way.

351
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,400
Come on.

352
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,330
Maybe you could move your leg.

353
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,970
- L... Nothing. - Try pulling it up.

354
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:23,700
Two girls squawking at you, and nowhere to run. You are in hell, boy.

355
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,650
Any of you skirts ever changed a goddamn tire?

356
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,080
Enlighten us, cowboy.

357
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,780
Feisty.

358
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:35,480
Never really works to pull when all you really needed was some good pushing.

359
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,660
- Know what I mean? - Hurry up and lift the thing!

360
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:41,490
All right, grab hold.

361
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:45,500
Three, two, one. Push!

362
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,600
Come on!

363
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:52,940
All right. Hold on, hold on, hold on. We got ourselves a situation.

364
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,100
- We can do this. - Come on!

365
00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:00,020
Three, two, one, push!

366
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,190
Happy New Year.

367
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:11,990
Happy goddamn New Year.

368
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,230
What?

369
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,070
Daddy?

370
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:34,270
It's all right, baby. It's all right.

371
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,420
All right, all right. There you go.

372
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,930
Give me your water and your hankie, sweetie.

373
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:58,130
I think it's just a cut, but I wanna clean it anyway, okay?

374
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:00,500
I'm gonna look for a way out of here.

375
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,170
- Chris. - Yeah?

376
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:09,080
Thank you very much.

377
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:14,510
Sir, I didn't... I mean, she saved me.

378
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,000
Are you okay?

379
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,630
Just a bad headache.

380
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,530
Here, finish this.

381
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:31,560
One thing we have a lot of around here is water.

382
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:35,480
My name is Nelson.

383
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:40,550
Elena. How bad is it?

384
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,510
It's very bad.

385
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,880
Were you with someone?

386
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,890
Yeah.

387
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,050
Not really.

388
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,120
My brother's in the hospital.

389
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,900
I didn't have any money to get to New York...

390
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:04,130
...so I meet this guy at a club, he works on a ship.

391
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:08,710
He says I can bunk with him, you know, for passage.

392
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,870
He was pretty nice.

393
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,790
What are you doing?

394
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:24,690
Thinking.

395
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:28,630
- You? - Thinking.

396
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,560
What are we thinking about, exactly?

397
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,600
Well, I figure this door is the way up.

398
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:37,670
I'm thinking, "what's behind it?"

399
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,640
Hey. Easy there, fireball.

400
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,370
Watch.

401
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:51,280
Conor! Hey, conor, what are you doing?

402
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:53,510
Hey, Mom, this door is the way up.

403
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:56,490
Don't walk off from me like that, okay?

404
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:59,590
- Hey, it's the other guy. - Hey.

405
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,430
Yeah, Robert, that door is extremely hot, but it's our only choice.

406
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,570
- Here. What do you think? - Let's give it a shot.

407
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:10,730
I'm hoping it was a flash fire, but this whole area could be superheated still, right?

408
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:13,880
- You tour on a sub? - I wouldn't call it touring.

409
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,770
Go.

410
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,640
- Flash fire. - Good call.

411
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,340
It's all right.

412
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,110
- So how long were you in the Navy? - Too long.

413
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:30,090
I feel like I know your dad.

414
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:35,330
He was mayor of New York for a while. When I was a kid.

415
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,230
Cool.

416
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,690
It wasn't.

417
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,450
Another way up, anybody?

418
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:05,650
I've been sneaking around this ship for days. This is it.

419
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:08,130
- All right, then we climb. - Is it gonna hold?

420
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,920
It's possible. It is steel.

421
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,160
Look at the monkey boy.

422
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:15,240
Chris, what are you doing? Come back.

423
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:21,740
I think it'll hold.

424
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:32,120
Go easy.

425
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:39,730
Elena.

426
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,760
You're halfway there, come on.

427
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:45,860
Chris, wait. Come back and get conor.

428
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,970
Conor, put your foot right where my foot is and go to Robert.

429
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,300
There you go. Put your hand right there.

430
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:53,530
Okay, hang on. I'll grab him.

431
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,640
Great.

432
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:02,180
You might wanna take it easy on that.

433
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:05,880
- You got him, chris? - I got him.

434
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,850
Excellent, excellent, excellent, yes.

435
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,660
- You got her? - Okay. Here you go.

436
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,870
- Okay, baby, it's your turn. - Hell, no. Lucky Larry's ready to go.

437
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,400
What?

438
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:27,440
Oh, yeah. Right, sorry.

439
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,770
You know, I forgot. Big hero.

440
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:34,610
Rescued all those women and children from the fires.

441
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:38,810
Got elected. Man of the people.

442
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:41,580
But you're not the boss anymore.

443
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,590
You quit, couldn't hack it.

444
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:47,560
If I recall correctly, you couldn't even hang onto your wife.

445
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,960
Come on. Come on.

446
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:55,070
Dad. Dad, let it go, okay? Please.

447
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,070
"Daddy, please." come on.

448
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:05,710
Hey, man. Hey, you got it. Knock yourself out.

449
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,780
- It's okay. - Go ahead.

450
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:09,850
Assholes, both of you.

451
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,150
You're right. It's okay.

452
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:18,320
I'm not gonna let you bring me down with you, not by a short hair.

453
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:22,220
You don't just get the nickname Lucky Larry.

454
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,730
You gotta be lucky.

455
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,910
No!

456
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,570
Damn it.

457
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:40,240
Hey, who's shooting at us?

458
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,460
Jen! Jen!

459
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:02,300
Get back, get back!

460
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:14,340
So we gotta go back down one level and we find another way up.

461
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,510
Go back down? We just came through there. There is no other way.

462
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:18,880
You go that way, you die.

463
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,990
We didn't look through every corridor.

464
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,150
You do what you want. I'm getting across.

465
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:25,160
If you got a better idea, I'm all ears...

466
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:28,200
No, Robert, I don't got another way, but I'm getting across!

467
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,990
You get stuck here, you'll die! We're going. Let's go.

468
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:33,640
- Daddy, I can't. I'm sorry. - What?

469
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,170
- Dylan, can you get me across? - Jen, baby girl, listen...

470
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:40,800
No! I haven't been in a long time, Dad.

471
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:51,920
Chris asked me to marry him.

472
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:58,080
I love him. I need to find a way to go with him.

473
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:01,590
- No, you need to listen to me for a second. - I'm not going back, Dad.

474
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,600
I hate to break up the family therapy, but you still looking for a way across?

475
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:07,130
Yes.

476
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,630
Do you see him? Where is he?

477
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:45,660
Hey, did you miss me?

478
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:49,040
Son of a bitch.

479
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,880
- What do you need? - All right. Take the slack.

480
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:05,550
Got it?

481
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:10,590
Hey, Ramsey! Ramsey!

482
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:13,000
Come on.

483
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:15,190
I did the hard part.

484
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:23,770
You couldn't even find your way home from school. We lived two blocks away.

485
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:27,770
- I remember, Dad. - Hey, Ramsey, come on!

486
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:34,850
Daddy?

487
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:40,260
Come on, Jen, you'll be fine. Come on!

488
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:42,190
Jenny!

489
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:47,160
Now, what kind of kid can't find her way home?

490
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,860
I was 7, by the way.

491
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,010
So, what do you think? You too big for a piggyback ride?

492
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:55,630
- Not today. - All right.

493
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:59,270
All right, baby. Hold on.

494
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:01,940
Here we go. Hang on, baby!

495
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,880
I gotcha.

496
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:08,610
They're okay.

497
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,030
- You wanna hit me? - Actually...

498
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:18,760
...you're doing pretty good. So far.

499
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:20,330
Can we keep going here?

500
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,060
Yeah, let's go. This way's the best way up.

501
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:17,980
Hurry.

502
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,580
You're okay.

503
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,100
Let's go.

504
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:24,300
Come on!

505
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:27,500
Come on, let's go. Look for a way up, everybody.

506
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:33,470
- I got an access hatch here! - Over here!

507
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:42,580
Dylan, we got water coming in over here!

508
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:54,660
Back up!

509
00:48:55,540 --> 00:49:00,060
- Get back! - Wait a minute. I got something here!

510
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:03,600
All right, get that corner.

511
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:09,450
We can't all fit in there. We don't even know where it goes.

512
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:12,850
If we stay here, we drown. Let's go! We gotta keep moving up.

513
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:14,350
Oh, my God!

514
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:18,920
All right. I got a vertical shaft up ahead about 10 yards.

515
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:21,120
Looks like it leads to the upper levels.

516
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:23,260
- Chris? - Might as well give him a chance...

517
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:25,630
...to kick me in the head. - Come on, chris!

518
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:45,680
We're good. The shaft leads up.

519
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:49,760
- Are you okay, sweetheart? - I think so.

520
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,360
Just keep on moving.

521
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:13,340
God. How the hell did you fit through here?

522
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:20,650
Mom, don't look down, okay?

523
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:23,920
- Okay, Nelson, you're next. - Okay.

524
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:26,850
- I'll be the last one. You go. - Elena, just get in the vent.

525
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:29,120
- I'll wait here a little longer. - You're fine.

526
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:32,390
- I can't go in there. I'm sorry, I can't! - Elena, get in the vent.

527
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:34,560
The water's rising. Elena, get in the vent!

528
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:38,730
- Elena, if you don't go, we don't go. - What? What?

529
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,130
No! No!

530
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:43,000
Go on, go! Grab her, grab her! You got her?

531
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,140
It seems congratulations are in order, chris.

532
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:48,710
Thank you, sir.

533
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:50,950
I'm glad she finally told you.

534
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:54,710
Well, tradition might have had you coming to me first.

535
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:56,360
Yeah, I realize that.

536
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:00,480
And I wanted to, I really did, but she made me promise not to say anything.

537
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:02,790
She's really careful when it comes to you, sir.

538
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,630
- Let me out! Let me out! - Come on, Elena.

539
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,460
- You're doing great. Come on. - Elena, take my foot!

540
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:13,200
Grab my ankle. That's it. That's it. That's it.

541
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:19,270
- You can do it. That's it, just hold on. - I can't breathe.

542
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:26,470
No.

543
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,560
Elena?

544
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:39,600
We're gonna go up now.

545
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,820
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

546
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:09,260
I'm stuck!

547
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:13,370
Oh, my God. He's stuck. Please, get me out! Get me out!

548
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:17,990
- Get me out, out, out! - Hey, calm down, calm down.

549
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:21,430
Get me out of here.

550
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:25,040
Elena, you need to reach up and help him.

551
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,510
I need you to reach up and help him. Reach up.

552
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:37,790
- Conor. Conor, can you crawl up here? - Yeah.

553
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:40,960
Get me out! Get me out!

554
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:43,360
Get me out of here!

555
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:50,700
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.

556
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:53,960
Now, you feel that screw on the other side?

557
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:56,130
- Yeah. - Turn it to the left.

558
00:52:56,910 --> 00:52:58,340
You got it?

559
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,410
Elena. Elena.

560
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:04,850
Hey, hey. Nelson tells me you're on your way to see your little brother.

561
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,250
Is he older or younger?

562
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:10,220
- He's younger. - Younger?

563
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:12,420
Yeah, he was always so small.

564
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:16,690
Elena, you don't want your little brother to think you didn't come.

565
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,160
You understand?

566
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:21,430
- No. I'm too scared! - Just reach up and grab Nelson's foot.

567
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,800
- Come on. - Please.

568
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:24,270
Promise me I get to see him!

569
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,270
- Reach up and grab his foot! - Push my foot.

570
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,930
Promise me I get to see him!

571
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:31,340
Okay, I promise. I promise you'll see him, just reach up.

572
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,580
There you go. There you go!

573
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:36,010
Now push!

574
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:39,020
Just breathe. Come on, you got it!

575
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:42,590
Push, Elena. Push him up! That's it, Elena!

576
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,620
Push! You got it, there, yeah!

577
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:49,390
You got it, there you go!

578
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,190
I did it, I did it, I did it.

579
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,700
- Oh, thank you. - Now climb!

580
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:57,560
- Hurry, hurry! - Come on, do it again.

581
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,100
It's... It's too tight.

582
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:02,500
Oh, my God.

583
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,740
How are we going up there?

584
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:06,240
We're working on it.

585
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:11,580
We need something up here we could use as a screwdriver.

586
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:13,120
A coin, a ring, anything.

587
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:14,810
I can't even get into my pockets.

588
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:16,880
Wait, wait!

589
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:22,490
Oy vey, that would be ironic.

590
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:29,960
Conor, you're gonna do this. Don't worry. Here we go.

591
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:32,370
Hurry! Hurry!

592
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:35,670
Hurry up!

593
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,810
- Okay, turn it to the left. - Okay.

594
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:39,410
Come on.

595
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:42,280
Can you reach it? Don't drop it.

596
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:44,780
Come on!

597
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:47,010
- Is that working? - Yeah.

598
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,090
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

599
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:53,350
Come on, we got it.

600
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:21,450
Don't worry, sweetie, Dylan's right behind me.

601
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:25,860
This thing's sealed from the other side!

602
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:27,780
It's the only way out.

603
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,060
- Except for this, maybe. - Another vent? No, not again.

604
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:34,460
No, wait a minute. What's this up here?

605
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:38,000
Dylan, give me your hand.

606
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,730
I need somebody's help!

607
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,410
- We'll be okay. - Got it.

608
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:54,550
There you go. Any idea where we are?

609
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,210
We got two more levels after this, come on;

610
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:01,990
Got him?

611
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,600
Oh, my God. What is this place?

612
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:17,500
This is a ballast tank. They fill these up to keep the ship stable.

613
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:21,370
That valve right there leads to the tank next door. That may be our way through.

614
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:23,010
May be? What other way is there?

615
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:26,240
It's a pressure valve. It won't open unless there's tremendous pressure.

616
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:29,550
- Oh, don't tell us we're trapped. - No, no, it'll open.

617
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,950
How?

618
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:34,460
By flooding this entire tank.

619
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,660
- What? - Exactly.

620
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:40,230
- No. You don't even know if it's gonna open! - That's insane. It's nuts.

621
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,370
- Wait a minute. We drown ourselves? - No. No one's drowning.

622
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:44,730
That valve will open...

623
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:48,700
...and the water'll carry us from one tank to the next till we find an open hatch.

624
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,780
- How do we know there's an open hatch? - Or if we can find it...

625
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:54,380
...before we run out of air? - It's our only option!

626
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:57,070
What about the a.c. Vent down there? We never tried that.

627
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:59,410
- Let's try the new vent. - I can't go. I'm sorry.

628
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:01,920
- Just go without me. - Mom, the water's coming!

629
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:03,320
Get away.

630
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:06,080
- Dylan, listen to me. - We need to make a decision.

631
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,060
You better be right. Flood it.

632
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:17,460
- Oh, my God. - Everybody, back up. Get back!

633
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,660
- What? No. - Dylan, you can't.

634
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:23,400
- Now, get back there. - Jen, come here. Come here, honey.

635
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:26,640
- Get back! Back up! Ready? - Just open the valve!

636
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:33,740
- Now! Over here! - All right, stay calm.

637
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:42,950
- Come on, just grab on! - I can't...

638
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:47,730
Nelson!

639
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:49,970
Nelson.

640
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:55,570
Hang onto the side!

641
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:58,280
- Chris! - Baby, hold on tight!

642
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,640
- That's it. - Oh, my God!

643
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:04,210
- Start swimming! - Hold on, baby!

644
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:05,650
Hold on!

645
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,230
Get away from it!

646
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,470
You okay?

647
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:44,010
Come on!

648
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:52,960
Dad!

649
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:56,280
- You all right? - Yeah.

650
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:00,730
Where's Dylan? Dylan!

651
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:03,930
Where's Dylan? Can you see him?

652
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:08,660
There's a... There's an open hatch. Right here. Take a deep breath.

653
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,500
- We're gonna go through. - How far?

654
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:13,170
- Take a deep breath! - Right here.

655
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:16,850
- Is there a way out? - I'm sure there is.

656
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:19,380
- Maggie! - Okay.

657
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:22,110
- Maggie, give him to me. - No, I've got him.

658
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:26,050
Let me take him. I was a swimmer in high school. I tell you, I got him.

659
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:29,040
Where's Nelson and Elena?

660
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:31,480
They were right behind me.

661
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:49,530
Sweetie, move back.

662
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:25,200
Come on, breathe!

663
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:33,190
Come on, everybody.

664
01:04:36,110 --> 01:04:37,510
Come on.

665
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:57,050
You were never on the swim team.

666
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,520
Nope.

667
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:30,850
Think we got a hallway here.

668
01:05:33,570 --> 01:05:35,290
Let's go.

669
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:38,700
All right. Come on, come on. There we go. There we go.

670
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:43,160
Here.

671
01:05:44,410 --> 01:05:46,540
Conor, go back to Dylan!

672
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:49,680
Hang on a second. Wait, wait, wait!

673
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:52,210
What is it?

674
01:05:55,590 --> 01:05:57,380
- It's a rescue. - Hello!

675
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:59,890
- Hey, hello! Hello! - Hello!

676
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:02,320
- Hello! - We're inside!

677
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:03,960
- Hello! - Is anybody there?

678
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:05,620
- Hello! - Hello!

679
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:09,100
- Hey, we're here! - Can you hear us?

680
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:13,030
- Hello! - We're here!

681
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:16,000
Hello? What is it?

682
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:17,930
It's nothing.

683
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:48,470
Flash fire.

684
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:53,880
Superheats the air. Burns the lungs like rice paper.

685
01:06:57,820 --> 01:06:59,680
Hey, guys. Down here. Down here.

686
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:11,260
- What do you got? - Down this corridor is the bow, right?

687
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:14,990
There's an access hatch right there that puts us into the bow-thruster room.

688
01:07:15,170 --> 01:07:18,860
We get into the propeller tubes and the only thing between us and the outside...

689
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:21,010
...is nothing. - All right. Let's go.

690
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:23,110
Let's go. That's our way out.

691
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:32,940
All the way to the end, and up the hatch.

692
01:07:41,930 --> 01:07:43,590
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

693
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,060
Conor!

694
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:55,670
- Bow's underwater. - What does that mean?

695
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:58,610
- The thrusters are under there. - How far? Maybe we can swim.

696
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:01,080
No. It's too far.

697
01:08:01,650 --> 01:08:04,310
There's something else we can do, right?

698
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,310
What do you think?

699
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:08,880
Hey.

700
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:15,250
All right.

701
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:18,260
All right, we gotta get back up to high ground.

702
01:08:19,330 --> 01:08:21,990
We're gonna find another way out of here. Break into twos.

703
01:08:22,170 --> 01:08:25,860
Everybody start looking for an emergency exit, any exit. Let's go.

704
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:36,510
Come on.

705
01:08:59,670 --> 01:09:01,830
Have you found anything?

706
01:09:02,010 --> 01:09:06,000
Nothing. There's just no way out.

707
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:37,340
You know, there's nothing fair about who lives and dies.

708
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:40,140
You gave Elena a chance.

709
01:09:40,980 --> 01:09:43,350
You gave everybody a chance.

710
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:46,710
You did great.

711
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:21,750
- What is that? - Oh, my God, not again. Conor!

712
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,420
Conor!

713
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,230
Maggie!

714
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:39,760
That cleared the bow! Come on, let's go! Come on.

715
01:11:39,930 --> 01:11:42,020
We can get out now.

716
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:44,790
Come on.

717
01:11:51,210 --> 01:11:53,140
You go.

718
01:11:58,850 --> 01:12:00,680
Maggie! Maggie!

719
01:12:01,990 --> 01:12:03,610
Maggie!

720
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:06,450
Maggie!

721
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:10,250
Oh, my God.

722
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:13,330
Maggie. Maggie. Hey, hey.

723
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:16,190
Are you hurt? Are you hurt?

724
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:18,460
- Conor! Conor! - Are you okay?

725
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:23,130
Maggie, we'll find him. We'll find him. Come on. Come on!

726
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:24,610
Conor!

727
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:44,850
That's gotta be the propeller tube.

728
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:48,160
Come on! Come on, look for an opening.

729
01:13:05,450 --> 01:13:06,940
What is that?

730
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:13,460
No. No. No. No, Nelson, don't!

731
01:13:19,030 --> 01:13:20,620
- I got him. Come on. - Lift.

732
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,790
Pick him up. Ease back.

733
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,930
Watch his head.

734
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:47,850
- Conor! - Conor!

735
01:13:48,030 --> 01:13:49,550
Mom!

736
01:13:51,130 --> 01:13:53,120
Mom!

737
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:55,300
Conor!

738
01:14:02,210 --> 01:14:04,400
Chris. Chris, come here!

739
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:07,410
You gotta hurry, the water's rising fast!

740
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:10,310
I wanna show you something. Here.

741
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,880
Here. Take a look at this.

742
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:20,450
The control room for these engines is down this ladder...

743
01:14:20,630 --> 01:14:22,620
...and through about 150 feet of water.

744
01:14:22,790 --> 01:14:25,160
We have to get there and shut them off.

745
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:27,730
No. No, look, we'll grab a bunch of this junk, right?

746
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:30,600
We throw it up into the props, and it'll jam everything up.

747
01:14:30,770 --> 01:14:34,100
The propellers are turning the wrong way. It'll kick everything back in.

748
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:36,430
Chris, we need to shut them off.

749
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:40,170
- Conor! - Conor!

750
01:14:42,150 --> 01:14:43,710
Honey.

751
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:47,820
- Honey! - I'm in here!

752
01:14:47,990 --> 01:14:50,280
- Conor? - Mom!

753
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:55,690
Maggie, here!

754
01:14:57,830 --> 01:14:59,060
Honey!

755
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:04,200
Oh, God. Oh, honey.

756
01:15:04,370 --> 01:15:07,670
- How'd you get in there? - I don't know, but the water's really high.

757
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:11,170
Look at me. Dylan's here, and we're gonna get you out, okay?

758
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:13,900
Oh, my God, he's gone under! Conor!

759
01:15:14,450 --> 01:15:17,810
Okay, look at me. Look at me. Stay with me, okay?

760
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:20,350
I can't, I can't. I can't stay up.

761
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:24,550
- I can't find an access hatch. - Baby, look at me. Look at me.

762
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:27,020
- I can't, I can't. - Yes, you can.

763
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:28,850
- I can't stay up, Mom. - Yes, you can.

764
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:46,670
But no one can swim that far. We'll find another way.

765
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:50,080
You know how much I love you.

766
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:54,180
Yes. Yes, but don't do this.

767
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:58,150
- Dad. Dad, please! - You're not gonna make it, sir.

768
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:03,090
You just won't! I mean, come on, it's ridiculous. It's too far, you know it.

769
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:06,720
But I think that I could make it. I think I could do it on one breath.

770
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:09,300
How would you get back? You'd already be out of air.

771
01:16:09,470 --> 01:16:11,130
One of us has to do this, all right?

772
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:14,700
It has to be the one that has the best chance of making it, and that's me.

773
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:17,770
- Tell me I'm wrong. - Dad.

774
01:16:19,110 --> 01:16:20,580
You're not.

775
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:23,800
Chris...

776
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:28,810
...thank you. - Yeah.

777
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:37,890
Baby, I need you to tell me that you love me.

778
01:16:41,130 --> 01:16:43,970
I need to hear it. It's all that matters.

779
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:56,610
Sir, I need you to tell me how l...

780
01:16:58,820 --> 01:17:00,510
Daddy!

781
01:17:00,690 --> 01:17:03,950
No! Daddy!

782
01:17:19,570 --> 01:17:22,540
- Nothing. - No, please!

783
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:28,540
Look, baby, the water's gonna rise, and I am right here, okay?

784
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:32,380
I'm right beside this wall touching you, okay?

785
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:33,850
I love you, Mom.

786
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:38,010
You have to be strong. I love you, and I am here with you, okay?

787
01:17:43,630 --> 01:17:45,530
Dylan!

788
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:38,640
- Oh, baby. - Mom.

789
01:19:46,350 --> 01:19:47,610
- Sweetie. - Mom.

790
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:54,960
Jenny. Jen, listen.

791
01:20:16,510 --> 01:20:17,980
Come on.

792
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:27,590
Okay, it's here.

793
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:38,530
Robert! Robert!

794
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:45,980
Dylan, over here!

795
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:49,800
- Where's Robert? - The engines were running.

796
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:54,480
Control room's underwater. He wouldn't let me go. He shut them down.

797
01:20:54,650 --> 01:20:56,590
How long? How long?!

798
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:03,020
Wait! What's that?

799
01:21:24,550 --> 01:21:26,540
Why are they still running?

800
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:34,080
He reversed the engines! He's creating suction!

801
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:37,160
And we can throw junk up into the props!

802
01:21:37,330 --> 01:21:38,630
He's a genius!

803
01:21:42,270 --> 01:21:44,290
Chris! The red tank!

804
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:04,420
Get back! Get back!

805
01:22:38,860 --> 01:22:40,480
No!

806
01:22:48,670 --> 01:22:50,360
I can't. I can't.

807
