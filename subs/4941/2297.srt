感谢 笑笑笑 莙。black伟 翻译字幕

1
00:00:50,806 --> 00:00:53,104
你在那里
There you are.

2
00:00:54,777 --> 00:00:57,541
我正要找你
I've been looking for you.

3
00:01:02,918 --> 00:01:05,409
你看到我的另一只鞋了吗？
Have you seen my other shoe?

4
00:01:09,358 --> 00:01:10,825
什么？
What?

5
00:01:12,628 --> 00:01:14,187
什么？
What?

6
00:01:16,633 --> 00:01:19,466
你为啥那样看着我啊？
Why are you looking at me like that?

7
00:01:31,381 --> 00:01:32,678
滚蛋
Go potty.

8
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:35,983
Scotty
Scotty.

9
00:01:37,253 --> 00:01:40,017
得了吧，小子。Scotty
Come on, boy. Scotty.

10
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,282
滚球，Scotty
Go potty, Scotty.

11
00:02:28,272 --> 00:02:29,534
别那样看着我
Don't look at me like that.

12
00:02:37,548 --> 00:02:38,776
啥？
Yes?

13
00:02:40,317 --> 00:02:42,718
这是一天总最好的开始，好吧？
Great way to start the day, right?

14
00:02:43,388 --> 00:02:45,356
我认为我会吐的
I think I'm gonna puke.

15
00:02:46,925 --> 00:02:50,053
妈妈说你下星期走
Mom said you went on a date last week.
怎么走？
How'd it go?

16
00:02:50,228 --> 00:02:51,695
还好。
It was okay.

17
00:02:52,064 --> 00:02:54,760

"Okay" as in you got laid?

18
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,067
Harry
- Harry.
干嘛？
- What?

19
00:02:58,236 --> 00:02:59,726
她听不到你说的话
She can't hear you.

20
00:02:59,905 --> 00:03:02,874
你不是想做爱吗？任何时候
Don't you wanna have sex,
like, ever again in your life?

21
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:06,943
嗯。我不认为我是约会类型
Yes. I just don't think
that I'm the dating type.

22
00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:11,012
女孩只想跟我上床因为他们在高中看我的书
Girls only wanna sleep with me
because they read my book in high school.

23
00:03:11,183 --> 00:03:12,207
然后？
So?

24
00:03:12,384 --> 00:03:14,113
然后他们就对我不感兴趣了
So they're not interested in me.

25
00:03:14,286 --> 00:03:16,754
他们对我的一些想法感兴趣
They're interested in some idea of me.

26
00:03:16,922 --> 00:03:21,052
那就是为什么你应该在外面工作
That's why you should keep working out.
那样，他们就会想你的肉体
That way, they'll want you for your body.

27
00:03:24,563 --> 00:03:26,225
这种事怎么做？
What does this thing even do?

28
00:03:26,399 --> 00:03:28,526
它会让你变成上帝
It turns you into a god.

29
00:03:28,701 --> 00:03:30,259
坚持
Keep going.

30
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:36,502
嘿，昨晚我做了一个很糟糕的梦
Hey, I had a weird dream last night.

31
00:03:36,676 --> 00:03:39,076
有一个女孩，她是
There was this girl and she was...

32
00:03:39,245 --> 00:03:41,076
她看起来怎么样？
What'd she look like?

33
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:43,808
就是一个普通的女孩，只是我梦到的
Just a normal girl. Just a girl I made up.

34
00:03:44,584 --> 00:03:46,074
好，后来怎么啦？
Well, what happened?

35
00:03:46,252 --> 00:03:48,186
她就跟我说话
She just talked to me.

36
00:03:49,388 --> 00:03:50,912
很无聊
That's depressing.

37
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:53,789
目前，这还是美好的
Actually, it was really nice.

38
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,891
真的？你没有在你的梦里倒下？那...
Seriously? You don't even get laid
in your dreams? That's...

39
00:03:58,064 --> 00:03:59,964
那真悲哀。
That's just sad.

40
00:04:07,006 --> 00:04:09,133
嘿，你的新书进展如何？
Hey, how's the new book coming along?

41
00:04:09,308 --> 00:04:12,972
我不知道。我有一个好的想法，就是为什么我不写一些关于我的爸爸的事呢？
I don't know. I get a good idea,
like why don't I write about my dad?

42
00:04:13,147 --> 00:04:17,015
然后，bam，我开始想这是最愚蠢的事情
And then, bam, I start thinking
that it's the stupidest thing ever.

43
00:04:17,184 --> 00:04:19,812
谁想阅读这“他对我很失望...
Who wants to read about,
"He was disappointed in me...

44
00:04:19,987 --> 00:04:21,887
狗屎，狗屎，狗屎”？
blah, blah, blah, blah"?

45
00:04:22,623 --> 00:04:25,114
对Scotty我感到很矛盾
Also, I'm feeling ambivalent
about Scotty.

46
00:04:25,492 --> 00:04:27,460
嗯，他都流口水了。他一直在追
Yeah, he slobbers. He chews things.

47
00:04:27,628 --> 00:04:30,290
他小便就像女孩子一样，让我很不适应
He pees like a girl,
which makes me feel inadequate.

48
00:04:30,764 --> 00:04:34,131
他需要多出去走走，散散心。这就是我问什么不写书的原因
He needs to go outside a lot, breaks up
my day. That's why I'm not writing.

49
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:36,826
你认为那是你不写书的原因吗？
Do you think that's why you're not writing?

50
00:04:38,806 --> 00:04:42,207
不，
- No.
为什么认为你不写书？
- Why do think you're not writing?

51
00:04:43,777 --> 00:04:45,836
我现在可以拥有Bobby了吗？
Can I have Bobby now?

52
00:04:47,548 --> 00:04:50,949
你现在需要Bobby吗？
- Do you need Bobby now?
是的
- Yes.

53
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,716
Calvin
Calvin...

54
00:04:55,156 --> 00:04:57,647
你最后一次看到朋友是什么时候？
when's the last time you saw a friend?

55
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,353
Harry。Yesterday
Harry. Yesterday.

56
00:04:59,527 --> 00:05:02,894
不，不
No, no.
除了你兄弟之外
Someone other than your brother.

57
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:07,193
你给了你其他的病人Bobby吗？
Have you been giving Bobby
to your other patients?

58
00:05:07,368 --> 00:05:09,131
没有，只把Bobby给你
No, Bobby is just for you.

59
00:05:09,304 --> 00:05:12,740
因为闻起来很怪异
- Because he smells weird.
- Calvin
- Calvin...

60
00:05:12,907 --> 00:05:16,570
你决定什么时候去拿Scotty，我们在说什么？
when you were deciding to get Scotty,
what did we talk about?

61
00:05:16,744 --> 00:05:20,009
你说你的愿望是什么？
What did you say your hopes were?
你还记得吗？
Do you remember?

62
00:05:20,448 --> 00:05:23,110
是他帮我约见一些人
That he would help me meet people.

63
00:05:23,284 --> 00:05:25,377
大声一点，行吗？
A little louder, please?

64
00:05:25,553 --> 00:05:28,420
他很棒，我们要带上一些行李徒步旅行
That he would be awesome and
we'd take hikes and stuff.

65
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,491
人们会去亲吻他然后我就可以约见他们了
And people would stop to pet him,
and I would meet them.

66
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:34,219
但是在人们亲吻Scotty的时候他很害怕
But Scotty gets scared
when people try to pet him.

67
00:05:34,395 --> 00:05:36,556
这让你困扰了?
Does that embarrass you?

68
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:41,035
没有
- No.
我想给你一个写书的任务
- I wanna give you a writing assignment.

69
00:05:41,203 --> 00:05:43,194
我不会写的
- I can't write.
好吧
- Okay.

70
00:05:43,706 --> 00:05:45,640
这只能你可以做
This would just be for me.

71
00:05:45,808 --> 00:05:48,003
我只要你写一页
I'd like you to write a page...

72
00:05:48,177 --> 00:05:52,307
关于看到Scotty流口水的人和害怕他的人...
about someone who sees Scotty
all slobbery and scared...

73
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:55,382
还有喜欢他的人
and likes him anyway,
只是这些
just the way he is.

74
00:05:55,551 --> 00:05:57,985
你认为我可以写出来吗？
You think you could do that for me?

75
00:05:59,088 --> 00:06:00,919
不会很糟糕吧？
Can it be bad?

76
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,456
我想会很糟糕
I'd like it to be very bad.

77
00:06:13,168 --> 00:06:16,695
在Calvin19岁的时候我第一次见到他
I first met Calvin
when he was 19 years old.

78
00:06:16,872 --> 00:06:18,533
他当时已经是...
And he'd already been at the top...

79
00:06:18,707 --> 00:06:22,337
纽约时报几个月的销售榜榜首了
Of The New York Times Best Seller
list for several months.

80
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,612
我记得是这样：
And I remember thinking:

81
00:06:26,316 --> 00:06:27,613
他妈的那个小孩是谁啊？
"Who the fuck is this kid?

82
00:06:28,985 --> 00:06:32,682
我怎么才能几时的回去？
And how can I go back in time
and be him?"

83
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:37,421
一个在下巴长着粉刺的高中辍学者...
A high-school dropout
with acne still on his chin...

84
00:06:37,594 --> 00:06:42,395
让我们知道什么才能变成一本经典的美国小说
gave us what may very well become
a classic American novel.

85
00:06:42,565 --> 00:06:45,728
从那时起，
Since then, of course,
我们都喜欢他的短篇小说...
we've all enjoyed his short stories...

86
00:06:45,902 --> 00:06:49,599
也包括去年的中篇小说“饕餮盛宴”
Including last year's novella,
Breakfast for Dinner.

87
00:06:49,973 --> 00:06:53,465
但只有当我静下心来重读他的作品时
But it was only when I sat down
and reread his novel...

88
00:06:53,643 --> 00:06:57,977
精美的十周年纪念版现已上市
now available in a beautiful
10th anniversary edition...

89
00:06:58,148 --> 00:07:03,643
我才意识到卡尔文·威尔菲尔兹有多么优秀
that, I realized just how good a writer
Calvin Weir-Fields is.

90
00:07:03,954 --> 00:07:06,320
今生有他，实属幸运
We are lucky to have him around.

91
00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:08,321
女士们，先生们，有请卡尔文·威尔菲尔兹女士们，先生们，有请卡尔文·威尔菲尔兹
Ladies and gentlemen,
Calvin Weir-Fields.

92
00:07:27,845 --> 00:07:30,473
- 无与伦比，太棒了
- 谢谢，非常感谢
- Phenomenal, man. Just brilliant.
- Thank you. Thanks.

93
00:07:30,648 --> 00:07:32,013
- 太棒了
- 非常感谢
- Brilliant.
- Thanks so much.

94
00:07:32,183 --> 00:07:33,309
- 卡尔文 - 你好
- Calvin.
- Hi.

95
00:07:33,484 --> 00:07:35,884
你还记得查理去妓院的那一章吗？
You know that chapter
where Charlie goes to the whorehouse?

96
00:07:36,053 --> 00:07:39,819
是不是因为查理母亲的蓝色围裙你才让妓女穿蓝色呢？
Did you dress the whores blue because
it's the color of his mother's apron?

97
00:07:39,991 --> 00:07:41,151
抱歉…
I'm sorry...

98
00:07:41,325 --> 00:07:43,623
你是怎么找到投稿的地方的呢？
How did you know
where to send your manuscript?

99
00:07:43,794 --> 00:07:45,056
我查了查
I looked it up.

100
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:46,594
那是当然
Oh, of course.

101
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:51,528
之前你那么成功现在想起来会不会很奇怪呢？
Is it weird for you
that you used to be so successful?

102
00:08:00,545 --> 00:08:02,479
你在这
There's the man.

103
00:08:02,647 --> 00:08:04,774
Cycus，你该提醒我这些事
Cyrus, you gotta remind me
about these things.

104
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,884
兄弟，你得看看我给你发的短信
You have to check your messages,
buddy.

105
00:08:07,052 --> 00:08:08,952
我该穿得正式一些
I would've worn something nicer.

106
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,521
你是天才，没人在意你穿什么
No one cares what you're wearing.
You are a genius.

107
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,590
别说我是天才
Don't use that word.

108
00:08:13,892 --> 00:08:15,086
佩罗塔先生，看这边
Mr. Perrotta, over here.

109
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,251
- Calvin才华横溢
 - 看这边
- Calvin always had talent.
- Over here.

110
00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:19,397
但光有才华显然不够
But that, unfortunately, is not enough.

111
00:08:19,564 --> 00:08:21,794
-  兰登，看这边
- 我所做的这一切…
- Langdon, right here!
- All I did, really...

112
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:27,371
是给他指引了正确的方向，就像是把接力棒交给他
was guide him in the right direction
and like, pass the baton.

113
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:29,406
Mabel
Mabel.

114
00:08:29,574 --> 00:08:30,632
什么？
What?

115
00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:32,436
我是Mabel
I'm Mabel.

116
00:08:32,611 --> 00:08:35,445
- 我们认识吗？
- 不认识
- Do I know you?
- No, no.

117
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,310
你想要我的电话吗？
Do you want my number?

118
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,280
那是本难得的好书
太棒了
- It's a one-off, that book.
- Great.

119
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:42,046
- 那是独立乐队的首张专辑
 - 谢谢
- It's the first album of an indie band.
- Thank you.

120
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:46,055
它有着自然的炙热感情……
It has that sort of
unselfconscious verve...

121
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:49,524
那个…你不会…
that... That you don't...

122
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,630
之后当然会有创作瓶颈，这个…
Then, of course, there's
the second album syndrome, which...

123
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,289
这个我们就不说了
We don't talk about that.

124
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:57,595
人人都爱这本书，但我们想知道你目前的进度
Everyone loves this book,
but we wanna hear what you're doing now.

125
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:01,467
重要的是现在，在写什么书，能说说吗？
What matters is right now.
What are you working on? Are you...?

126
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,939
他们爱你，然后抛弃你
They love you, then they throw you away.

127
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,273
- 我是说，如果我要创作角色的话
 - 实际上，做普通人
- I mean, if I'm gonna include anybody...
- It's actually easier...

128
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:10,211
生活更轻松
if you've only ever been mediocre.

129
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,008
如果你已经到达了顶峰
If you've been at the top...

130
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:14,585
- 嗨，抱歉
-嗨
- Hi. Sorry.
- Hi.

131
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,346
这回杀了你的
It can kill you.

132
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:19,720
对，Salinger有一个好的想法。他...
Yeah, Salinger had the right idea. He...

133
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:24,830
写了一个比你轰动的作品，然后消失了，你知道吗？
Write what you can, then, pssh, disappear,
you know?

134
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:28,928
我没有喝酒
So I've had a drink.

135
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:32,436
也没有嗑药。我没有...嗑药
But no coke. I didn't... No coke.

136
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:34,164
我从不嗑药
I didn't do any coke.

137
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:51,081
Scotty？
Scotty?

138
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:54,521
Scotty？
Scotty?

139
00:09:57,631 --> 00:09:59,861
对不起我迟到了，Bubby
Sorry I'm late, buddy.

140
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,936
Scotty？
Scotty?

141
00:10:05,874 --> 00:10:08,069
Scotty,他妈的是什么？
Scotty, what the fuck?

142
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:36,559
她很可爱
She's so cute.

143
00:10:37,772 --> 00:10:39,000
什么？
What?

144
00:10:39,174 --> 00:10:41,836
你的狗。她很可爱
Your dog. She's so cute.

145
00:10:42,744 --> 00:10:43,904
他是公狗
Oh, he's a boy dog.

146
00:10:45,914 --> 00:10:48,440
他只是像母狗那样撒尿
He just peed like a girl.

147
00:10:49,852 --> 00:10:51,410
我们以前见过吗？
Have we met before?

148
00:10:51,587 --> 00:10:53,555
我不认为见过
I don't think so.

149
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,549
你介意我给他画一幅画吗？
Do you mind if I draw him?

150
00:10:57,226 --> 00:10:58,557
但是别太近
But don't get too close.

151
00:10:58,727 --> 00:11:00,957
他有点怕人
He's a little scared of people.

152
00:11:12,441 --> 00:11:13,908
你是艺术家？
- You're an artist?
是的
- Yeah.

153
00:11:14,076 --> 00:11:16,476
我技术超好
- I'm super good.
真的吗？
- Really?

154
00:11:18,113 --> 00:11:20,946
你的狗叫什么？
- What's your dog's name?
Scotty
- Scotty.

155
00:11:21,116 --> 00:11:22,674
你是苏格兰人？
- Are you Scottish?
不是
- No.

156
00:11:22,851 --> 00:11:25,786
我叫他F。Scott Fitzgerald
I named him for F. Scott Fitzgerald.

157
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,686
谁？
- Who?
F. Scott Fitzgerald
- F. Scott Fitzgerald.

158
00:11:30,859 --> 00:11:32,452
那个小说家
The novelist.

159
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:34,460
很好
Great Gatsby.

160
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:38,028
我没读过很多小说
I don't read a lot of fiction.

161
00:11:38,201 --> 00:11:40,669
你从来没听过F. Scott Fitzgerald？
You've never heard of
F. Scott Fitzgerald?

162
00:11:40,837 --> 00:11:43,670
为什么？他真的很出名，很重要吗？
Why? Is he really famous and important?

163
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,537
好吧，他大概是现在仅有的最好的小说家了
Well, he's probably one of the greatest
novelists who ever lived.

164
00:11:47,711 --> 00:11:50,271
那很无礼吗？
Isn't that disrespectful?

165
00:11:50,447 --> 00:11:51,505
什么？
What?

166
00:11:52,515 --> 00:11:55,541
在他死后用他的名字来命名你的狗？
这是有点很无礼
Naming your dog after him?
It's a little disrespectful.

167
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:58,654
不，这是一种姿态
- No, it's a gesture.
对，一种冒犯性的姿态
- Yeah, an aggressive gesture.

168
00:11:58,822 --> 00:12:02,189
想想吧，你是一个小说家
Think about it. You're a novelist.
你认为这个家伙是最好的
You think this guy's the greatest.

169
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:05,294
所以你你用他的名字来命名你的狗来降低他的声望
So you name your dog after him
to cut him down to size.

170
00:12:05,629 --> 00:12:07,460
这里，你可以拴住他
This way, you can put him on a leash...

171
00:12:07,631 --> 00:12:09,292
嚎叫“坏Scotty"...
and yell "Bad Scotty"...

172
00:12:09,466 --> 00:12:12,629
感到很有优越感因为你在里面撒尿
and feel all superior
because you pee inside.

173
00:12:14,938 --> 00:12:17,373
杀了你的偶像吧，伙计。我完全赞同
Kill your idols, man. I'm all for it.

174
00:12:20,678 --> 00:12:22,509
好吧。Scotty
All right. Scotty.

175
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,840
坚持住
Hang on.

176
00:12:29,887 --> 00:12:32,378
很漂亮嘛
- This is beautiful.
是的
- Yeah.

177
00:12:32,556 --> 00:12:35,491
你的狗或许像母狗那样撒尿
Your dog might pee like a lady,
但是我还是喜欢
but I like him anyway.

178
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,922
嘿，你刚才说什么？
Hey, what did you just say?

179
00:12:37,094 --> 00:12:40,495
我喜欢他撒尿像母狗
I like him just the way he is.

180
00:12:43,768 --> 00:12:45,326
对

对，对
Yes. Yes.

183
00:13:23,942 --> 00:13:27,378
像、、、并上他的眼睛
"Pooled into his eyes as though...
像血液一样忽然返回...
Rushed back like blood...

184
00:13:27,746 --> 00:13:29,213
Calvin脸红因为...
Calvin flushed with..."

185
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,440
你是一个天才
You're a genius.

186
00:13:32,617 --> 00:13:34,608
我认为我们不要用那个词
I thought we weren't
gonna use that word.

187
00:13:34,786 --> 00:13:37,880
你是真真正正的天才
You are really, really super fucking smart.
我想它变坏
"I'd like it to be bad."

188
00:13:38,056 --> 00:13:40,650
很高兴你能找到鼓励你的东西
I'm glad you found something
that inspires you.

189
00:13:40,826 --> 00:13:42,350
鼓励我？
Inspires me?

190
00:13:42,961 --> 00:13:45,829
它贬低了我
It overwhelms me.
我逐渐的无法睡觉跟吃东西了
I literally cannot sleep or eat.

191
00:13:45,998 --> 00:13:47,431
我想做的是写作
All I want I do is write.

192
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,434
我的意思是，我今天几乎来不了这里了
I mean, I almost didn't come here today
因为我不想远离她
because I didn't wanna be away from her.

193
00:13:52,405 --> 00:13:53,531
天啦
- Oh, God.
什么？
- What?

194
00:13:53,706 --> 00:13:57,335
上帝啊。
Oh, my God.
我不能大声说出来
Oh, I can't say it out loud.

195
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:00,240
真是太愚蠢了

当你说愚蠢的事时我爱它
- I love it when you say stupid things.

196
00:14:00,413 --> 00:14:04,975
这真的是非常非常的愚蠢

好吧
- Okay.

197
00:14:07,387 --> 00:14:09,355
那我创作的这个家伙...
Okay, so the guy I'm writing...

198
00:14:09,522 --> 00:14:10,989
他叫什么？

Calvin
Calvin.

200
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:18,397

无论如何，他身上有很多方面复制于我
Anyway, there's a lot of me in him.

201
00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:21,797
我想说的是...
What I'm trying to say is...

202
00:14:22,135 --> 00:14:25,002
就像我去跟她度过写作的时间
it's almost like I'm writing
to spend time with her.

203
00:14:25,171 --> 00:14:26,832
谁？
- Who?
那个女孩

204

我在晚上睡觉...

等待拿回我的打字机所以我可以跟她一起
just waiting to get to my typewriter
so I can be with her.

206
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,809
这就像...
It's like...
就像我跟她恋爱了
It's like I'm falling in love with her.

207
00:14:36,984 --> 00:14:39,817
真精彩
- That's wonderful.
我不可以跟我写的这个女孩相爱
- I can't fall in love with a girl I write.

208
00:14:39,987 --> 00:14:41,750
为什么不可以？
- Why not?
因为她不是真实的
- Because she's not real.

209
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,981
她不是？你确定？
- Isn't she? Are you sure?
不是。我确定
- No. Yes.

210
00:14:44,158 --> 00:14:46,922
她只是我想像出来的产物
She's some motherfucking product
of my imagination!

211
00:14:49,163 --> 00:14:52,599
Lila对我很坏。

他们的爸爸死后会留下谁？

their father dies?

213

确实不是爱你的人
Someone who couldn't
love you properly.

214
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:59,871
一个无情的荡妇
- Someone who is a heartless slut.
够了
- Okay.

215
00:15:00,674 --> 00:15:04,371
好，告诉我她的一些事
- Well, tell me about her.
我以后都不想再说LIla的事了
- I don't wanna talk about Lila anymore.

216
00:15:04,545 --> 00:15:08,641

00:17:30,761 --> 00:17:32,820
它一直倒腾隔壁怪邻居的垃圾桶
He goes through
my weird neighbor's garbage.

258
00:17:32,997 --> 00:17:35,295
- 这是别人不要了的胸衣吗？
- 是脏的
- So that's a random dirty bra?
- It's dirty.

259
00:17:35,466 --> 00:17:37,024
真恶心，孩子都开始咳嗽了
That's gross. You made him cough.

260
00:17:37,568 --> 00:17:39,627
Calvin，别收了，扔掉
Calvin, don't put it away.
Throw it away.

261
00:17:39,804 --> 00:17:42,102
我发誓，要是你妈知道…
I swear, if your mother knew...

262
00:17:42,506 --> 00:17:44,337
Calvin，这都是什么啊
- 什么？
- Calvin, what is this?
- What's what?

263
00:17:44,508 --> 00:17:46,703
-  没什么
- Harry，过来
- Nothing.
- Harry, get over here.

264
00:17:47,111 --> 00:17:48,703
别翻了
Please, don't.

265
00:17:49,113 --> 00:17:51,411
- 这些是内裤吗？
- 娘的
- Are these panties?
- Fuck off.

266
00:17:51,582 --> 00:17:53,516
我发誓Scotty一直往家里拖这些东西
I swear, Scotty's been dragging them in.

267
00:17:53,684 --> 00:17:54,946
- 对，Scotty是罪魁祸首
- 闭嘴
- Right. Scotty.
- Shut up.

268
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:58,520
Calvin，把这些扔了
Calvin, throw these away.

269
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:09,465
Susie,我去看看Harry
- Hey, Susie, I'm gonna check on Harry.
好
- Okay.

270
00:18:09,635 --> 00:18:12,729
- 告诉他一会儿得走了
- 好
- Tell him we have to go soon.
- Okay.

271
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:32,647
怎么样？
So?

272
00:18:33,725 --> 00:18:35,716
你打算怎么写？
Where do you see this going?

273
00:18:36,762 --> 00:18:38,787
不清楚，这才刚开头
Well, I don't know. I just started.

274
00:18:38,964 --> 00:18:41,899
这是个爱情故事吧
This is a love story, right?

275
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:44,228
现在谁会看爱情故事呢？
Who reads love stories?

276
00:18:44,403 --> 00:18:45,927
女人
Women.

277
00:18:46,104 --> 00:18:48,971
我告诉你，女人不会看这个
And I'm telling you,
no woman's gonna wanna read this.

278
00:18:49,141 --> 00:18:50,267
为什么？故事很浪漫啊
Why not? It's romantic.

279
00:18:50,442 --> 00:18:54,607
因为性情古怪，生活一团糟还可爱的女人并不存在
Quirky, messy women whose problems
only make them endearing are not real.

280
00:18:55,548 --> 00:18:57,379
完了
Period.

281
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,041
怎么说来着，得“写你所经历过的”
What do they say,
"write what you've been through"?

282
00:19:00,219 --> 00:19:02,847
- 写你了解的东西
- 对，写你了解的东西
- Write what you know.
- Exactly. Write what you know.

283
00:19:03,022 --> 00:19:04,683
- 写你了解的东西
- 对，写你了解的东西
- I've known girls like Ruby.
- Yeah?

284
00:19:04,857 --> 00:19:06,222
谁啊
who?

285
00:19:06,459 --> 00:19:07,983
女孩儿
Girls.

286
00:19:08,161 --> 00:19:10,561
- Lila吗？
- 不是该死的Lila
- Lila?
- Not fucking Lila.

287
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,891
- 你就谈过一次恋爱
- 谈了5年
- You've had one relationship.
- For five years.

288
00:19:13,066 --> 00:19:15,261
你俩都没同居过
You never even lived together.

289
00:19:16,269 --> 00:19:19,363
听我说，Calvin，蜜月顶个屁用
I'm telling you, Calvin,
the honeymoon shit, it doesn't last.

290
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:22,770
- 我知道
- 和女人生活在一起就不一样了
- I know that.
- Women are different up close.

291
00:19:22,942 --> 00:19:24,637
我爱Susie
I love Susie...

292
00:19:24,977 --> 00:19:26,740
但她是怪人
but she's a weirdo.

293
00:19:26,913 --> 00:19:31,179
有时候，她没缘由地刻薄
Sometimes, she's mean as fuck
for no reason.

294
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,578
她是一个真实的人
She's a person.

295
00:19:35,021 --> 00:19:37,649
你写得不是真人，明白吗？
You haven't written a person, okay?

296
00:19:37,824 --> 00:19:40,225
- 你写的是女孩儿
- 够了，管他呢
- You've written a girl.
- All right, whatever.

297
00:19:40,394 --> 00:19:42,862
作家不会给人看还在创造阶段的书稿
Writers don't show their work
to people at this stage.

298
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,998
我也许不会继续写下去
I might not even finish it.

299
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:47,927
因为…我不喜欢这么跟人说
Because...
And don't, like, tell people about it.

300
00:19:48,435 --> 00:19:51,461
听着，我没说你不能写下去
Listen. I'm not saying you can't write.

301
00:19:52,806 --> 00:19:54,774
我是说...
I'm saying...

302
00:19:55,809 --> 00:19:58,437
你不了解女人
you don't know jack shit
about women.

303
00:20:02,483 --> 00:20:05,850
瘦杆儿，剩菜剩饭别浪费了
Don't let those leftovers go to waste,
okay, skinny?

304
00:20:07,054 --> 00:20:08,112
明天去健身房吗？
Gym tomorrow?

305
00:20:08,288 --> 00:20:10,279
我要见Cyrus
I'm seeing Cyrus.

306
00:20:10,457 --> 00:20:13,153
星期五呢？
- Maybe Friday?
就星期五
- Friday.

307
00:20:13,827 --> 00:20:15,317
- 我知道
- 小子，还好吧
- I know.
- You okay, bud?

308
00:20:15,496 --> 00:20:16,758
还行
Yes.

309
00:20:49,631 --> 00:20:51,394
这东西滴得到处都是
This thing is dripping everywhere.

310
00:20:53,334 --> 00:20:55,734
你到底打算怎么吃啊？
How are you supposed to eat this thing?

311
00:21:02,777 --> 00:21:03,801
怎么了？
What?

312
00:21:05,914 --> 00:21:08,349
你真不是我菜
You're so not my type.

313
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,717
你不是我的菜是什么意思？
What do you mean I'm not your type?

314
00:21:12,555 --> 00:21:18,858
通常我会找更专断的男人
I usually go for guys
who are a little more assertive.

315
00:21:19,428 --> 00:21:22,158
- 我就那样
- 不
- I'm assertive.
- No.

316
00:21:22,331 --> 00:21:24,697
你是固执，这不一样
You're stubborn. That's different.

317
00:21:26,902 --> 00:21:28,597
我的某个男朋友
I had this one boyfriend...

318
00:21:28,771 --> 00:21:30,796
说我没意思
who told me I wasn't funny...

319
00:21:30,973 --> 00:21:33,032
但其实我幽默感挺好的
but that I have a good sense
of humor...

320
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,700
他讲笑话我都笑
because I laughed at his jokes.

321
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,210
为什么你会跟那种家伙约会？
Why would you date a guy like that?

322
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,213
我年少不懂事。你也肯定有遗憾的事吧
I was young.
You must have things you regret.

323
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,645
不一定
Not really.

324
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:45,378
一切都会很快回复正常的
Everything's been perfect so far.

325
00:21:49,592 --> 00:21:53,620
所以你和他们约会是因为
So that's what you're looking for
in a guy?

326
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:55,793
他们够二吗？
Douchiness?

327
00:21:59,302 --> 00:22:01,099
不知道
I don't know.

328
00:22:01,271 --> 00:22:03,865
我想我一直在找你
I guess I was looking for you.

329
00:22:07,944 --> 00:22:10,310
花了我不少时间才终于找到你
It just took me a while to find you.

330
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:19,051
Ruby
- Ruby.
跳
- Jump!

331
00:22:30,901 --> 00:22:33,699
第一次看到我你怎么想的？
What did you think
the first time you saw me?

332
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:38,171
我想你是我见过的最漂亮的女孩
I thought you were
the most beautiful girl I ever saw.

333
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:41,300
当你了解我的时候你不失望吗？
Were you disappointed
when you got to know me?

334
00:22:41,479 --> 00:22:43,640
你怎么可以问这个啊？
How can you ask that?

335
00:22:43,814 --> 00:22:45,213
我很脏乱
I'm such a mess.

336
00:22:45,383 --> 00:22:48,045
我爱你的脏乱
I love your mess.

337
00:22:48,486 --> 00:22:51,785
第一次见到你，我认为
The first time I saw you, I thought:

338
00:22:51,956 --> 00:22:53,583
看那个男的
"Look at that boy.

339
00:22:53,758 --> 00:22:59,492
我将会永远永远的爱他
I'm going to love him
forever and ever and ever."

340
00:22:59,664 --> 00:23:02,531
要是你跟我破裂呢？
- What if you get sick of me?
不会
- I won't.

341
00:23:03,801 --> 00:23:05,826
我保证
I promise.

342
00:23:12,977 --> 00:23:14,968
你好，狗屎
Hello. Shit.

343
00:23:17,615 --> 00:23:19,174
狗屎
Shit.

344
00:23:22,988 --> 00:23:25,684
靠
Hello. Damn it.

345
00:23:26,658 --> 00:23:29,126
好吧
Okay. No.

346
00:23:31,964 --> 00:23:33,625
那好
- Hello.
Cyrus
- Cyrus.

347
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:35,323
你他妈的在哪啊？
- Where the fuck are you?
对不起
- Sorry.

348
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,798
我在写作，后来我就睡着了
I was writing, I fell asleep.
我立刻就去找你
I'll be right there.

349
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:40,632
看吧，如果你不说这些，就会没事
Look, if you aren't ready to
talk about this, it's fine.

350
00:23:40,806 --> 00:23:42,865
不，不...不
No... No, no.
我想让你看到我得到了什么
I wanna show you what I have.

351
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:45,066
我认为接下来你会很兴奋的
I think you're gonna be really excited.

352
00:23:45,243 --> 00:23:48,406
当然，我会感兴趣的。好吧
Of course, I'll be excited. Okay,
这就是我接下来要做的。我退掉我的午餐
here's what I'll do. I'll push my lunch.

353
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:53,347
没事儿，我现在离开就好了
Okay. All right. Well if I leave now,
我15分钟就到
I should be there in 15 minutes.

354
00:23:53,518 --> 00:23:55,679
好
- All right.
如果不塞车的话
- If there isn't any traffic.

355
00:23:55,854 --> 00:23:57,287
天啊。Scotty
Oh, damn it. Scotty.

356
00:23:57,456 --> 00:23:59,515
怎么了？
- What?
没事，我的狗撒尿了
- Nothing. My dog has to pee.

357
00:23:59,691 --> 00:24:02,091
我把它放到后花园
- I'll put him in the backyard.
我会带它出去
- I'll take him out.

358
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,320
好，谢谢
- Great. Thank you.
Cal？
- Cal?

359
00:24:05,531 --> 00:24:06,964
Cal？
Cal?

360
00:24:07,467 --> 00:24:08,764
你好？
Hello?

361
00:24:09,135 --> 00:24:11,103
我昨晚在床上还想起你
I missed you in bed last night.

362
00:24:11,671 --> 00:24:14,139
你现在写了好作品吗
- Did you get some good writing done?
你在哪里吗？
- Are you there?

363
00:24:14,307 --> 00:24:15,934
上帝啊
- Oh, God.
你想被咬吗？
- Hey, you want a bite?

364
00:24:16,109 --> 00:24:18,373
爽快
- It's Crispix.
我认为我已经忘记他了
- I think I lost him.

365
00:24:19,178 --> 00:24:22,875
天啊，发生了
God, it's happening.
这个时候终于发生了
It's really happening this time.

366
00:24:23,216 --> 00:24:25,343
他们让我住院了
- They're gonna hospitalize me.
怎么回事？
- What's wrong?

367
00:24:25,518 --> 00:24:29,511
他们都认为我很聪明
They all thought I was so smart,
但是原来是神经失常
but it turns out I was just batshit.

368
00:24:29,689 --> 00:24:31,919
Calvin?
- Calvin?
他妈的什么事啊？
- What the fuck?

369
00:24:32,492 --> 00:24:34,119
Calvin
Calvin.

370
00:24:35,461 --> 00:24:37,258
这不是真的，这不是真的
It's not real. It's not real.

371
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,990
这不是真的，这不是真的
It's not real. It's not real.

372
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:41,656
这不是真的
It's not real.

373
00:24:41,834 --> 00:24:43,597
好吧，你这是在做梦
Okay, you're dreaming.

374
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,863
好吧，你这是在做梦
Okay, you're dreaming.

375
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:47,404
你这是在做梦
You're dreaming.

376
00:24:47,574 --> 00:24:49,166
你这是在做梦。。。
You're dreaming...

377
00:24:49,343 --> 00:24:53,074
你马上就会醒过来...
and you're going to wake up...

378
00:24:54,381 --> 00:24:56,281
立刻
right now.

379
00:25:16,403 --> 00:25:18,803
靠
Oh, shit.

380
00:25:22,209 --> 00:25:25,610
Calvin？你对我发火？
Calvin? Are you mad at me?

381
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:27,406
天啦，这不是真的
Oh, God. It's not real.

382
00:25:27,581 --> 00:25:31,517
这不是真的，这不是真的
It's not real. It's not real.
这不是真的
It's not real.

383
00:25:32,821 --> 00:25:34,345
医生
Doctor...

384
00:25:41,763 --> 00:25:44,960
你好，Rosenthal医生。这是Calvin Weir-Fields
Hi, Dr. Rosenthal. It's Calvin Weir-Fields.
有些事将要发生
Something has come up...

385
00:25:45,133 --> 00:25:49,536
如果你尽可能的找我，我会很欣慰的。谢谢
and I'd appreciate it if you called me
as soon as possible. Thank you.

386
00:26:02,584 --> 00:26:04,848
Ruby？
嘿
- Ruby?
- Hey.

387
00:26:08,022 --> 00:26:13,460
我知道你可能会饥饿
I thought you might be hungry,
所以我拿些鸡蛋给你
so I'm making you some eggs.

388
00:26:19,268 --> 00:26:21,634
怎么回事？
- What's wrong?
没事
- Oh, nothing.

389
00:26:21,804 --> 00:26:22,930
没事
Nothing.

390
00:26:23,639 --> 00:26:27,405
是这些吗，或许，你的？
Are these, by any chance, yours?

391
00:26:27,576 --> 00:26:30,136
当然，，他们是我的
Yeah, of course, they are.

392
00:26:30,646 --> 00:26:33,080
他们还属于谁？
Who else would they belong to?

393
00:26:34,183 --> 00:26:35,343
天啦
Oh, my God.

394
00:26:37,253 --> 00:26:39,187
你还看到有其他人？
- Are you seeing someone else?
没有
- Oh, no.

395
00:26:39,355 --> 00:26:41,016
不，不，我没有...
No, no, no, I'm not...

396
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:44,819
我没有其他人除了你
I'm not seeing anyone other than you.

397
00:26:46,929 --> 00:26:48,954
你会道歉吗？
Will you excuse me?

398
00:26:50,666 --> 00:26:53,464
还记得爸爸过去说我有活跃的想象力吗？
Remember how Dad used
to say I had an overactive imagination?

399
00:26:53,636 --> 00:26:55,866
你是说Ruby在你那里？
Are you saying Ruby is in your house?

400
00:26:56,038 --> 00:26:57,505
今天早上我才见到她
I started seeing her this morning.

401
00:26:57,673 --> 00:27:01,235
就像那部电影Harvey，除非她不是巨兔
It's like that movie Harvey,
except she's not a giant rabbit.

402
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,709
这也不想她想象出来的
It's not like she knows
she's imaginary, either.

403
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,371
她认为在书中我们是有关联的
She thinks we're in the relationship
in my book.

404
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:09,110
这把我吓到了
It is freaking me out.

405
00:27:09,619 --> 00:27:12,486
我在会议的中间
- I'm in the middle of a meeting.
但是这是一件不可预见的事
- But this is an emergency.

406
00:27:12,656 --> 00:27:14,089
我可能不能自制
I may be losing my mind.

407
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:18,083
等我一小会，就一小会...
- Just give me one sec. Just...
Harry，Harry。
- Harry. Harry.

408
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:20,661
Ruby是不可能在你家里的
There's no possible way
that Ruby's in your house...

409
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,525
因为她不是真实的
because she's not a real person.

410
00:27:22,699 --> 00:27:26,635
我知道她不是真实的，但是我跟你说
I know objectively she is not real,
but I'm telling you...

411
00:27:26,803 --> 00:27:28,862
我可以看到她，我可以嗅到她的气息
I can see her, I can smell her.

412
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,802
当她摸我的时候，我可以感觉到
When she touched me, I could feel it.

413
00:27:30,974 --> 00:27:34,273
她在厨房里煎鸡蛋，真的鸡蛋
She's making eggs in my kitchen.
Actual eggs.

414
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,706
很好
That's great.

415
00:27:35,879 --> 00:27:39,815
Calvin，我在工作。我在一个很重要的会议的中间位置
Calvin, I am at work. I'm
in the middle of a very important meeting.

416
00:27:39,983 --> 00:27:41,814
我没办法立刻处理你的破事。
I cannot deal with your shit right now.

417
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,887
听我说，我要你离开你的房子
Listen to me.
I want you to leave the house...

418
00:27:45,056 --> 00:27:47,957
去见见朋友。去见你那不会明白你的想象力的朋友
see a friend. A friend
who can't see your imaginary friend.

419
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:51,356
如果今晚还没解决，我们再聊，好吗？
If this is still an issue tonight,
we'll talk, okay?

420
00:27:51,529 --> 00:27:55,158
好吧。我打电话给我的朋友
Okay. I'll phone a friend.

421
00:27:55,733 --> 00:27:56,961
我很抱歉，我只是...
Sorry about that, I was...

422
00:27:57,134 --> 00:28:00,228
这个周末，Kobe开一个烧烤晚会。你有什么计划吗？
Kobe's having a barbecue this weekend.
You got plans this weekend?

423
00:28:00,404 --> 00:28:01,996
是Calvin
It's Calvin.

424
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,633
我姓Weir-Fields，中学时
Weir-Fields. From high school.

425
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:08,144
一名作者
Yeah, the writer.

426
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:10,712
在西班牙语言课上我做你旁边
I sat next to you in Spanish class.

427
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,451
不好意思，我要走了
Actually, I gotta go.

428
00:28:48,854 --> 00:28:50,822
你们去哪？
Where are you going?

429
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:54,888
外面
- Out.
哪里？
- Where?

430
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,925
去超市
To the store.

431
00:28:57,396 --> 00:28:58,829
为啥？
What for?

432
00:28:58,997 --> 00:29:01,124
购买一些食材
To get some stuff.

433
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:04,127
我可以一起吗？
- Can I come?
不行
- No.

434
00:29:04,303 --> 00:29:07,204
为什么？
- Why not?
因为.
- Because.

435
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:09,602
求求你了？
- Please?
不行
- No.

436
00:29:11,109 --> 00:29:13,135
求求你了？
Please?

437
00:29:32,465 --> 00:29:34,126
点九KCRW
Point-nine KCRW.

438
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,131
上一个，给KCRW人员的票
Up next, tickets for KCRW members.

439
00:29:36,302 --> 00:29:39,328
如果在最后90天内你没有从我们这得到任何东西
If you haven't won anything from us
in the last 90 days...

440
00:29:39,505 --> 00:29:43,168
我听说他们要在墓地那里办一个僵尸电影节
I hear they're doing a zombie film festival
at the cemetery.

441
00:29:43,343 --> 00:29:48,508
你想去吗？一有人被咬就可以用射击哦
You wanna go? We could do a shot
every time someone gets bitten.

442
00:29:48,681 --> 00:29:51,013
好吧。拜
Okay. Bye.

443
00:29:51,184 --> 00:29:52,674
拜？你要去哪?
Bye? Where are you going?

444
00:29:52,852 --> 00:29:54,547
不去哪啊
Nowhere.

445
00:29:55,388 --> 00:29:58,256
Café Figaro。我又朋友在那，不会很久的
Café Figaro. I've got this friend.
It won't take long.

446
00:29:58,425 --> 00:29:59,983
我应该做什么？
What am I supposed to do?

447
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,358
留在这。享受购物
Stay here. Enjoy the shops.

448
00:30:04,531 --> 00:30:06,590
我很快回来
I'll be back soon.

449
00:30:08,535 --> 00:30:10,503
当我没有马上接你的电话的时候
When I didn't hear from you right away...

450
00:30:10,671 --> 00:30:13,162
我还以为你把我的号码弄丢了
I figured you had lost my number
or something.

451
00:30:13,607 --> 00:30:16,371
至少我的室友这么认为
At least that's what my roommate said
must have happened.

452
00:30:16,944 --> 00:30:20,380
不，我没有忘记你的号码。实际上我遇见你的那晚
Oh, no, I didn't lose your number.
Actually the night I met you...

453
00:30:20,547 --> 00:30:23,744
我开始写作了，花了我不少时间
I started writing something,
so my life's been really consuming.

454
00:30:23,917 --> 00:30:25,111
你遇见我的那晚？
The night you met me?

455
00:30:25,419 --> 00:30:27,114
是不是我？
Am I...?

456
00:30:27,287 --> 00:30:29,812
没什么.没什么。
Never mind. Never mind.

457
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,753
我是你的作品里的人物吗？
Am I in it?

458
00:30:32,493 --> 00:30:34,757
- 现在不能说
- 当然
- I can't really talk about it.
- Right, of course.

459
00:30:34,928 --> 00:30:39,297
如果你写了我，小说出版发售的时候
But if I am, like, when it comes out
in stores and stuff...

460
00:30:39,466 --> 00:30:42,265
- 你会跟我说那个角色是我吗？
- 我没写你
- ...will you tell me which character I am?
- You're not in it.

461
00:30:42,437 --> 00:30:44,462
我知道，但如果写了呢？
Right, but if I am?

462
00:30:45,573 --> 00:30:46,733
我会告诉你
I will let you know.

463
00:30:47,142 --> 00:30:49,235
好的，太好了，太好了
Okay. Awesome. Awesome.

464
00:30:54,449 --> 00:30:57,043
你经常这么干吗?
So do you do this a lot?

465
00:30:57,218 --> 00:30:59,778
- 干什么？
- 午间约炮
- Do what?
- Meet up in the middle of the day for sex.

466
00:31:00,855 --> 00:31:03,688
不，不，我只想找人说会儿话
No. No, that's not...
I just wanted someone to talk to.

467
00:31:05,393 --> 00:31:08,055
这样啊
Right. Right.

468
00:31:08,229 --> 00:31:10,959
男人永远不会只想和女人说说话
Well, men never just wanna talk
to women.

469
00:31:11,132 --> 00:31:13,498
 我就是这样 - 
如果你坚持的话
- I do.
- If you say so.

470
00:31:13,668 --> 00:31:16,034
你成年了吗？
Are you even legal?

471
00:31:16,204 --> 00:31:20,265
还没到合法饮酒的年纪，但
I mean, not to drink, but, yeah.

472
00:31:20,442 --> 00:31:22,501
当然，你想…
Of course. Do you...?

473
00:31:22,777 --> 00:31:24,335
你想去别的地方吗？
Do you wanna go someplace?

474
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:28,915
- 嗨 
- 抱歉，什么？
- Hi.
- Sorry, what?

475
00:31:29,084 --> 00:31:30,608
你想去我那儿吗？
Do you wanna go to my place?

476
00:31:30,786 --> 00:31:32,344
你好
对不起
- Hi.
- Sorry.

477
00:31:32,521 --> 00:31:33,886
我很抱歉
发生了什么
- I'm sorry.
- What's going on?

478
00:31:34,056 --> 00:31:36,456
我要暂停吗
我想我听到了一些声音
- Am I interrupting?
- I thought I heard something.

479
00:31:37,092 --> 00:31:38,889
你想离开这里？
Calvin
- Do you wanna get out of here?
- Calvin.

480
00:31:39,061 --> 00:31:43,430
你知道这个女孩吗
是的，你好，我是Ruby,Calvin的女朋友
- Do you know this girl?
- Yeah. Hi, I'm Ruby, Calvin's girlfriend.

481
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:44,691
我想我们以前没见过
I don't think we've met.

482
00:31:45,434 --> 00:31:46,901
不是
No.

483
00:31:47,069 --> 00:31:50,561
我是Mable，我要走了
I'm Mabel. I was just going.

484
00:31:50,739 --> 00:31:52,798
你可以看到她？
是，我可以看到他
- You can see her?

485
00:31:52,975 --> 00:31:54,237
我可以看到她
I can see her.

486
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:57,206
你可以看到他
不要误会，好吗
- You can see her.
- Let's not make this worse, all right?

487
00:31:57,379 --> 00:31:59,870
对不起，我不知道
你可以快点来吗
- Sorry, I didn't know.
- Did Harry put you up to this?

488
00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:02,040
什么，你的哥哥不在吗
什么
- What, your brother is in on this?
- What?

489
00:32:02,218 --> 00:32:05,153
Rudy，很高兴见到你
calvin,好好写
Ruby, it was very nice meeting you.
Calvin, have fun writing.

490
00:32:05,654 --> 00:32:07,212
那女的他妈是谁？
Who the fuck was that?

491
00:32:07,389 --> 00:32:09,220
你可以看到她吗
Calvin,那是谁
- Can you see her?
- Calvin, who was that?

492
00:32:09,391 --> 00:32:11,952
我可以看她吗
他可以看到我吗，你是，，，？停
- Can I see her?
- Can he see me? What are you...? Stop.

493
00:32:12,128 --> 00:32:13,527
你怎么了
What's wrong with you, man?

494
00:32:15,765 --> 00:32:17,027
她没事
She's real.

495
00:32:17,834 --> 00:32:20,530
哦，不，Ruby
Oh, no. Ruby!

496
00:32:21,938 --> 00:32:23,530
Ruby!Ruby!
Ruby! Ruby.

497
00:32:23,707 --> 00:32:25,197
离我远点
Ruby!Ruby!
- Get away from me!
- Ruby! Ruby!

498
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:27,673
走开，走开
Ruby!
- Get away! Get away!
- Ruby!

499
00:32:27,944 --> 00:32:29,605
Ruby!求你了，听我说的
走
- Ruby, please, listen to me.
- Let go!

500
00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:31,508
停
听我说，冷静点，Ruby!
- Stop!
- Listen to me. Calm down. Ruby.

501
00:32:31,681 --> 00:32:33,239
不要靠近我
喂，你还好吧
- Get away from me!
- Hey, you okay?

502
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:34,974
你想让我叫警察来吗？
You want me to call the police?

503
00:32:35,151 --> 00:32:38,382
不用，谢谢
他是个完全的混蛋
No. Thank you.
He's just being a complete asshole.

504
00:32:38,555 --> 00:32:39,783
你确定？
Are you sure?

505
00:32:41,091 --> 00:32:42,285
是的
Yeah.

506
00:32:42,459 --> 00:32:44,484
谢谢，我很好
Thank you, I'm fine.

507
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:49,221
他是个完全的混蛋
你站远点
- Ruby.
- You stay away.

508
00:32:49,666 --> 00:32:53,067
天啊，我应该知道的
你一直表现得很奇怪，住手
God, I should have known. You've been
acting like such a freak... Stop!

509
00:32:53,236 --> 00:32:54,534
放开我
Let go of me!

510
00:32:54,705 --> 00:32:55,729
放我下来
Put me down!

511
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,431
放我下来，要不然我要叫了
Put me down or I'm gonna scream!

512
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:58,632
Ruby.
停下
- Ruby.
- Stop it!

513
00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:00,970
放我下来
Ruby？
- Put me down!
- Ruby?

514
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,612
噢，天啊，停下来
Oh, my God, stop!

515
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,647
停下来，噢，别咬了，
别咬了
Stop it. Oh, do not bite.
Do not bite.

516
00:33:05,816 --> 00:33:07,408
听我说
Listen to me.

517
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:10,281
事情发展太快
，我解释不清楚
There is a lot that is new here,
more than I can tell you.

518
00:33:10,454 --> 00:33:12,445
我无法接受这一切，你懂吗？
I'm having trouble processing it all,
okay?

519
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:14,352
告诉我关于这件事
Then talk to me about it.

520
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:16,288
不要跟其他女孩约会
Don't go on a date with another girl.

521
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,291
我没有约会
I wasn't on a date.

522
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:22,129
你怎么了
我不知道，抱歉
- What is going on with you?
- I don't know. I'm sorry.

523
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:27,499
哦，我只是有点麻烦
Oh, I'm just having trouble...

524
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:31,039
无法正常处理眼前的情况
wrapping my head
around the reality of this situation.

525
00:33:32,743 --> 00:33:34,574
你在这里
That you're here.

526
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,379
你是真实的
That you're real.

527
00:33:40,953 --> 00:33:43,513
这一切太不可思议了
It all seems pretty incredible.

528
00:33:49,094 --> 00:33:50,459
什么
What?

529
00:33:52,898 --> 00:33:55,423
亲我，笨蛋
Kiss me, stupid.

530
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:11,682
他妈的
Holy shit.

531
00:35:48,882 --> 00:35:53,980
看，我知道难以置信
但是你不得不相信我
Look, I know it's a lot to take in,
but you have to believe me.

532
00:35:54,155 --> 00:35:55,213
他是真实的
She's real.

533
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,915
我不知道为什么会这样
I don't know how or why...

534
00:35:58,093 --> 00:36:02,325
但是她在这里而且她是真实的
but she's here and she's real.

535
00:36:02,497 --> 00:36:04,021
我很喜欢
And I like it.

536
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:08,966
“真实”对于其他人意味着可以看到她
那就是我要告诉你的
- "Real" as in other people can see her.
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.

537
00:36:09,904 --> 00:36:13,101
我们去了餐厅
带史考特去公园遛弯儿
We've been to restaurants.
We take Scotty for walks in the park.

538
00:36:13,274 --> 00:36:18,576
有人跟她说话，她很和善
那不可能
- People talk to her. She's very friendly.
- That's impossible.

539
00:36:18,747 --> 00:36:21,079
显然有可能
It's apparently not.

540
00:36:24,319 --> 00:36:27,379
Rosenthal先生怎么说
What does Dr. Rosenthal say?

541
00:36:33,394 --> 00:36:35,590
你他妈的认真的吗？
Are you fucking serious?

542
00:36:35,765 --> 00:36:38,325
出现幻觉了人们会去看心理医生
People have shrinks
for when they start seeing things.

543
00:36:38,501 --> 00:36:39,593
我看不见东西
I'm not seeing things.

544
00:36:39,769 --> 00:36:41,999
- Calvin，打电话给他
不
- Calvin, call him.
- I can't.

545
00:36:43,105 --> 00:36:45,869
我告诉他如果我跟他说露比是我虚构的角色，
他不会相信
I told him when she was a character.
He won't understand.

546
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:48,475
打电话给他要不让我告诉妈
他会认为我有病
- Call him or I'm telling Mom.
- He'll think I'm crazy.

547
00:36:48,644 --> 00:36:50,134
你可能就是有病
You might be crazy.

548
00:36:50,446 --> 00:36:52,505
状况失控了
The situation is crazy.

549
00:36:52,681 --> 00:36:54,114
我不是
I am not.

550
00:36:54,483 --> 00:36:56,383
你听到...?嘿
Do you hear...? Hi.

551
00:36:56,552 --> 00:36:59,783
你听到你自己的声音吗，有吗
你听到你自己的声音吗，
Do you hear yourself? Do you?
Do you hear yourself? Really?

552
00:37:01,157 --> 00:37:05,389
跟一个你虚构的女孩同床共枕绝对不可能
There's no way that you're sleeping
with a girl that you made up.

553
00:37:14,637 --> 00:37:18,038
所以她不知道我写的是她
Hey, so she doesn't know
that I wrote her...

554
00:37:18,207 --> 00:37:20,642
所以不要说任何关于底稿的事情，好吗
so don't say anything
about the manuscript, okay?

555
00:37:20,811 --> 00:37:22,608
好吧
Yeah, okay.

556
00:37:23,747 --> 00:37:27,080
Hi, Ruby，很高兴见到你
我们现在打电话给意思？
Hi, Ruby. Great to meet you.
Can we call the doctor now?

557
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,581
- Harry.
- Calvin!
- Harry.
- Calvin!

558
00:37:28,752 --> 00:37:30,276
你好
Hey.

559
00:37:30,453 --> 00:37:32,284
你怎么来这么晚
What took you so long?

560
00:37:32,455 --> 00:37:35,322
你好， Ruby,这是我的哥哥，Harry.
你好
- Hey, Ruby, this is my brother, Harry.
- Hey.

561
00:37:35,492 --> 00:37:38,017
Harry.你好
你好
- Harry. Hi.
- Hi.

562
00:37:38,195 --> 00:37:40,493
你好，很高兴见到你
你好
- Hi. It's great to meet you.
- Hi.

563
00:37:41,131 --> 00:37:43,964
我之前听过很多关于的事情
从Calvin那里
I've heard so much about you
from Calvin.

564
00:37:44,134 --> 00:37:45,795
你是Ruby
You're Ruby.

565
00:37:45,969 --> 00:37:47,334
你是Harry
You're Harry.

566
00:37:47,504 --> 00:37:50,029
来自俄亥俄代顿的画家
The painter from Dayton, Ohio.

567
00:37:50,207 --> 00:37:52,437
是的
是的
- Yep.
- Yep.

568
00:37:52,609 --> 00:37:54,804
留下来吃晚饭吗？
我在做肉糜糕
Are you staying for supper?
I'm making meat loaf.

569
00:37:54,978 --> 00:37:57,276
她的厨艺很好
She's an amazing cook.

570
00:37:57,881 --> 00:38:00,782
是的，我可以跟你聊一会吗
去外面？
Yeah. Can I talk to you a second?
Outside?

571
00:38:00,951 --> 00:38:02,213
好的
Okay.

572
00:38:10,394 --> 00:38:13,886
你做什么了？从克雷格信息网雇了个演员吗
？这不好玩
What did you do? Hire some actress?
Craigslist? This isn't funny.

573
00:38:14,065 --> 00:38:15,532
我告诉过你，她只是消失了
I told you, she just appeared.

574
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,930
你是个作家，不是Ricky Jay
我知道
- You're a writer, not Ricky Jay.
- I know that.

575
00:38:18,102 --> 00:38:21,401
肯定得有合乎逻辑的解释
爱是没有逻辑的
- There's gotta be some logical explanation.
- Love isn't logical.

576
00:38:21,572 --> 00:38:23,938
不，但是你知道爱是什么吗
物理学或者玄学
No, but you know what is?
Physics. Or metaphysics.

577
00:38:24,108 --> 00:38:26,303
不会有人凭空出现
她是
- People don't appear out of thin air.
- She did.

578
00:38:26,477 --> 00:38:27,603
怎样
我不知道
- How?
- I don't know how.

579
00:38:27,778 --> 00:38:29,643
这是爱，这是想象
It's love. It's magic.

580
00:38:29,814 --> 00:38:31,372
好的
你在做什么
- Okay.
- What are you doing?

581
00:38:31,549 --> 00:38:32,880
打电话给你的医生
不要打
- Calling your doctor.
- Don't.

582
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,574
Harry. Harry.
给我
- Harry. Harry.
- Give me that.

583
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:37,778
我们可能...给我电话
Harry. 请听我说
- We might... Give me the phone.
- Harry, listen to me, please.

584
00:38:38,322 --> 00:38:40,381
记得你说过什么吗
当你遇见Susie的时候
Remember what you told me
when you met Susie?

585
00:38:40,558 --> 00:38:44,494
我没有假装她是我创造的
你说她是你梦想中的女孩
- I certainly didn't pretend I invented her.
- You said that she was your dream girl.

586
00:38:44,662 --> 00:38:46,653
那是我的事
That's what happened to me.

587
00:38:46,831 --> 00:38:48,094
Harry，不要嘲笑我
Harry, don't laugh at me.

588
00:38:48,267 --> 00:38:50,701
你就没想过她可能是个骗子吗
Has it occurred to you
that she might be an imposter?

589
00:38:50,869 --> 00:38:54,600
一些女孩想要靠近你
设法去拿到你写的东西
Some girl wanted to get close to you,
somehow got her hands on what you wrote.

590
00:38:54,773 --> 00:38:56,832
你是唯一一个读了我的稿子
You're the only one
who's read my manuscript.

591
00:38:57,009 --> 00:38:59,773
所以你开了一个玩笑
好的，好的，好的
- So unless you're playing some joke...
- Okay, okay, okay.

592
00:38:59,945 --> 00:39:03,540
说说你创造的这个人
你写的任何东西关于她是真实的
Let's say you created this person.
Everything you wrote about her came true.

593
00:39:03,715 --> 00:39:06,343
即使是最微妙的小事
是的
- Even the smallest things?
- Yes.

594
00:39:06,518 --> 00:39:09,783
你试着写更多吗
没有
- Have you tried writing more?
- No.

595
00:39:10,555 --> 00:39:12,022
写些关于她的事情
Write something about her.

596
00:39:12,758 --> 00:39:14,157
为什么，她很完美
Why? She's perfect.

597
00:39:14,326 --> 00:39:16,521
写些关于她的事情
看看这是否会变成现实
Write something about her,
see if it comes true.

598
00:39:16,695 --> 00:39:19,459
如果没有，那么你是对的
这是他妈的完美
If it does, then you're right
and this is a fucking miracle.

599
00:39:19,631 --> 00:39:20,859
如果什么都没有发生
And if nothing happens...

600
00:39:22,634 --> 00:39:24,829
可能我们要去警察局了
maybe we go to the police.

601
00:39:29,608 --> 00:39:33,101
不要打电话
去那里，正常活动，走
- Don't call...
- Just go in there and act normal. Go up.

602
00:39:36,449 --> 00:39:38,440
你的行为要正常
我不是说...
- You act normal.
- I'm not gonna say...

603
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:51,120
我们上楼去
上网查查
We're gonna go upstairs
and check on something online.

604
00:39:54,701 --> 00:39:57,431
你俩、们在外面嗑药了吗？
Were you guys getting stoned out there?

605
00:39:57,737 --> 00:40:01,002
好的，这是那时我离开的地方
Okay, here's where I left off.

606
00:40:04,377 --> 00:40:06,937
写些我们马上能察觉的东西
It has to be something
we notice right away, okay?

607
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,206
一些东西
Something obvious.

608
00:40:10,249 --> 00:40:13,548
她穿的是什么
是
- What she's wearing?
- Yes. Yes.

609
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,210
她穿的是什么
What she's wearing.

610
00:40:20,661 --> 00:40:22,595
她穿的是什么
What was she wearing?

611
00:40:23,197 --> 00:40:24,994
粉红色的
Was it pink?

612
00:40:27,935 --> 00:40:29,596
我知道了
I got it.

613
00:40:30,337 --> 00:40:32,100
好的，好的
Okay. Okay.

614
00:40:32,272 --> 00:40:35,173
写些她说的流利的法语
Write that she speaks fluent in French.

615
00:40:35,342 --> 00:40:37,105
好，写下它
Yeah, just put it down.

616
00:40:37,277 --> 00:40:40,440
我正在写
我..
- I'll do it.
- I...

617
00:41:16,518 --> 00:41:17,951
哈
Bah!

618
00:41:28,997 --> 00:41:32,433
我等会就回来，我有些事要做
等下，拿着
- I'll be right back. I have to do something.
- No, wait, hold it.

619
00:41:41,209 --> 00:41:42,767
Calvin
Calvin

620
00:41:53,856 --> 00:41:55,721
一瓶酒
Bottle of vino.

621
00:41:55,958 --> 00:41:59,985
好，你的哥哥看起来
很能喝
Great. Your brother looks like
he could use a drink.

622
00:42:06,335 --> 00:42:09,964
我不得不说
那是我吃过的最好吃的肉
I have to say,
that's the best meat loaf I've ever had.

623
00:42:10,139 --> 00:42:11,504
谢谢
Thank you.

624
00:42:11,674 --> 00:42:13,039
这是家传菜谱
It's a family recipe.

625
00:42:13,576 --> 00:42:15,476
我真的没有拿卡
I can't really take credit.

626
00:42:15,644 --> 00:42:18,772
所以你的，你的家在俄亥俄州
So your... Your family's in Ohio?

627
00:42:19,115 --> 00:42:22,778
是的，实际上，我的父母
在我还很小的时候死于车祸
Yeah. Actually, my parents died
when I was a baby in an accident...

628
00:42:22,952 --> 00:42:24,783
我离开了那里
and I got moved around a lot.

629
00:42:24,954 --> 00:42:26,182
我想不会再搬了
I guess the habit stuck.

630
00:42:26,355 --> 00:42:30,053
我在六年时间去了9个城市，所以
9个?
- I've lived in nine cities in six years, so...
- Nine?

631
00:42:30,227 --> 00:42:33,390
是的
很多城市
- Yeah.
- That's a lot of cities.

632
00:42:33,563 --> 00:42:36,191
很抱歉，我一直没认真对待这次谈话
I'm so sorry. I'm totally
monopolizing this conversation.

633
00:42:36,366 --> 00:42:38,459
不，很奇妙
No. This is fascinating.

634
00:42:38,768 --> 00:42:40,633
请一直往前走
Please, keep going. Please.

635
00:42:41,671 --> 00:42:43,366
多么好的一个男孩
What nice boys.

636
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:47,340
你的妈妈一定很自豪
在10年很难做到这样
Your mom must be so proud.
It's hard to raise a decent guy.

637
00:42:47,511 --> 00:42:50,844
我想一个人肯定要做些疯狂的事情
Oh, I think a person would have to do
something pretty amazing...

638
00:42:51,014 --> 00:42:52,504
去塑造一个好女性
to produce a good woman.

639
00:42:52,682 --> 00:42:54,274
很好
Okay. Great.

640
00:42:54,451 --> 00:42:57,818
你们看起来很像对方
我想Harry要走了
You guys like each other.
I think Harry has to go now.

641
00:42:57,988 --> 00:42:59,046
是的，兄弟
Right, buddy?

642
00:42:59,222 --> 00:43:02,157
他有时是个控制狂，对吧？
He can be such a control freak, right?

643
00:43:04,761 --> 00:43:06,456
我会很快回来
晚安
- I'll be right back.
- Good night.

644
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:09,155
我希望我们能快点见面
嘿，所以？
- See you soon, I hope.
- Hey. So?

645
00:43:09,332 --> 00:43:11,391
上车
什么
- Get in the car.
- What?

646
00:43:11,902 --> 00:43:13,837
上车
为什么？什么？
- Get in the car.
- Why? What...?

647
00:43:18,876 --> 00:43:21,071
太疯狂了！
That was insane!

648
00:43:23,181 --> 00:43:24,341
- Harry..
这太疯狂了
- Harry...
- This is insane.

649
00:43:24,515 --> 00:43:26,278
你用想象力造出了一个女人
You manifested a woman with your mind.

650
00:43:27,018 --> 00:43:29,486
老妈会被吓得
你不能告诉妈妈
- Mom's gonna fucking freak.
- You can't tell Mom.

651
00:43:29,654 --> 00:43:32,214
为什么？她很喜欢所有这个年龄的女孩
认真的
- Why not? She loves all this New Age shit.
- Seriously...

652
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:35,291
你不能告诉任何人
妈妈，Susie，任何人
you can't tell anybody.
Not Mom, not Susie. No one.

653
00:43:35,459 --> 00:43:38,622
这太疯狂了，我怎么能不告诉别人
他们会认为她是怪胎
- This is amazing. How can I not tell?
- They'll think she's a freak.

654
00:43:38,796 --> 00:43:42,596
我们可以说她是你的女朋友
她是我的女朋友
- We're gonna pretend she's your girlfriend?
- She is my girlfriend.

655
00:43:44,835 --> 00:43:46,166
认真的？
Seriously?

656
00:43:46,337 --> 00:43:48,328
为什么不
你的女朋友
- Why not?
- Your girlfriend.

657
00:43:48,506 --> 00:43:50,770
怪事发生了
我不这么认为
- Stranger things have happened.
- I don't think so.

658
00:43:51,342 --> 00:43:56,041
我想这是最奇怪的事
I think this is pretty much the strangest
thing that's ever happened, ever.

659
00:43:56,214 --> 00:43:58,046
你要跟她结婚？
跟她生小孩？
You gonna marry her?
Have kids with her?

660
00:43:58,217 --> 00:44:01,118
我不知道
但是那不是像乱伦了吗？
- I don't know.
- But wouldn't that be like incest?

661
00:44:01,286 --> 00:44:03,550
或者意念
我不关系
- Or mind-cest?
- I don't care.

662
00:44:04,256 --> 00:44:06,053
我爱她
I love her.

663
00:44:06,558 --> 00:44:08,150
不要摧毁
Please, don't ruin this for me.

664
00:44:08,327 --> 00:44:10,591
答应我，不告诉任何人
Promise me, no one.

665
00:44:14,299 --> 00:44:15,596
好
Fine.

666
00:44:16,134 --> 00:44:17,260
谢谢
Thank you.

667
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:24,369
嘿，你可以的，像改变她
Oh, hey, so you can, like, change her.

668
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,675
我想
I guess.

669
00:44:30,916 --> 00:44:35,376
你可以，像特殊的东西
如果你想
You could, like, tweak things
if you wanted.

670
00:44:35,554 --> 00:44:37,749
特殊？你的意思是什么
Tweak? What do you mean?

671
00:44:37,923 --> 00:44:40,448
我不知道，像任何东西
大胸，长腿
I don't know, like anything.
Big tits, long legs...

672
00:44:40,626 --> 00:44:43,687
我喜欢她的细腿
知道我多少次我想装个按钮吗
- I like her little legs.
- Know how many times I wanted a button...

673
00:44:43,863 --> 00:44:46,559
摁完她就不做那些烦人的事了
to make Susie stop doing
all the annoying shit she does?

674
00:44:46,733 --> 00:44:49,531
我意思是你可以做工作
任何你想的时候
I mean, you could get blow jobs
whenever you wanted.

675
00:44:49,702 --> 00:44:50,999
Ruby喜欢
Ruby loves giving blow jobs.

676
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:53,468
现在，还是几月几天
Now, but what about
in a couple months or days?

677
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,438
女人让男人琢磨不透
现在我看着苏西还会问自己
Women are mysterious creatures.
I still look at Susie like:

678
00:44:56,609 --> 00:44:58,338
你是谁，你是谁
"Who are you? Who are you?"

679
00:44:58,511 --> 00:45:01,503
我知道Ruby, Harry. 我写过她
I know Ruby, Harry. I wrote her.

680
00:45:01,681 --> 00:45:04,047
所以你可以让任何事
So you can make her, like, do anything.

681
00:45:07,754 --> 00:45:09,915
对于男人任何地方
For men everywhere...

682
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:13,650
告诉我你不会让那浪费
tell me you're not gonna let that
go to waste.

683
00:45:17,063 --> 00:45:19,861
我不会再写关于她的故事了
I will never write about her again.

684
00:45:28,842 --> 00:45:30,366
Calvin?
Calvin?

685
00:45:31,178 --> 00:45:32,702
嘿
Hey.

686
00:45:34,381 --> 00:45:37,544
所以他喜欢我？
So did he like me?

687
00:45:43,057 --> 00:45:44,957
他爱你
He loved you.

688
00:46:16,558 --> 00:46:18,526
停，停，停
Stop, stop, stop.

689
00:46:20,061 --> 00:46:21,824
你好，如果是我妈妈，请，不要..
Hey, if it's my mom, please, don't...

690
00:46:22,597 --> 00:46:24,155
喂
Hello?

691
00:46:24,933 --> 00:46:26,833
有人吗，有人在吗，我不是,,
Hello, is anyone there? I don't...

692
00:46:27,001 --> 00:46:28,127
嘿，妈
Hi, Mom.

693
00:46:28,303 --> 00:46:31,898
噢，甜心，嘿
我不确定你在那里
Oh, hi, sweetie. Hi.
I wasn't sure you were there.

694
00:46:32,073 --> 00:46:33,700
你想做什么，老妈
What do you want, Mom?

695
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:36,537
我想知道你这个周末
你回来吗
I was wondering if
you're gonna make it up this weekend.

696
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:39,305
我跟你说过我们不回去
我们很忙
I told you we can't this weekend.
We're busy.

697
00:46:39,481 --> 00:46:41,073
哦，跟谁
跟谁做事？
- Oh, with what?
- Busy with what?

698
00:46:41,249 --> 00:46:43,444
你的哥哥说
你没有写作了
Your brother says
you haven't been writing.

699
00:46:43,618 --> 00:46:46,246
他不知道
你已经跟这个女孩一起几个月了
- He doesn't know.
- You've been with this girl for months.

700
00:46:46,421 --> 00:46:49,549
我还没有见过她
我开始想她是不是不存在
I haven't even met her.
I'm beginning to think she doesn't exist.

701
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:51,851
什么，不，我意思是，是的
What? No. I mean, yes.

702
00:46:52,026 --> 00:46:54,461
所以我可以什么时候见到她
很快
- So when can I meet her?
- Soon.

703
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:57,463
下星期？
Harry和Susie也会在
Next weekend?
Harry and Susie will be here.

704
00:46:57,633 --> 00:46:58,657
请进
Come on, please?

705
00:46:58,834 --> 00:46:59,926
看，我们有个计划
Look, we have plans.

706
00:47:00,102 --> 00:47:02,502
我会打给你的，好吗
我正在开车
I'm gonna call you later, okay?
I'm driving.

707
00:47:03,572 --> 00:47:05,631
我们为什么不能去大索尔
Why can't we go to Big Sur?

708
00:47:05,808 --> 00:47:09,300
恩，我们必须要找人照顾Scotty
Well, we'd have to find someone
to watch Scotty.

709
00:47:09,478 --> 00:47:11,002
我们可以带着他跟我们一起
We could take him with us.

710
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:13,045
我不知道，Mort
I don't know. Mort...

711
00:47:13,215 --> 00:47:14,944
他们的房子很怪异
Their house is weird.

712
00:47:15,117 --> 00:47:16,482
你不想让我跟你妈妈见面
You don't want me to meet your mom.

713
00:47:16,652 --> 00:47:18,813
当然，我想让你跟我妈妈见面
Of course, I want you to meet my mom.

714
00:47:18,988 --> 00:47:21,456
我会邀请她来参加圣诞节，好吗
I'll invite her down for Christmas, okay?

715
00:47:26,128 --> 00:47:29,894
嘿，你知道在维尔街有间咖啡店吗
一间新开的？
Hey, you know that coffee shop on Dwyer?
The new one?

716
00:47:30,065 --> 00:47:31,657
是的
Yes.

717
00:47:32,635 --> 00:47:36,628
我在想可能
我会试着去找份工作
I was thinking maybe
I could try to get a job there.

718
00:47:36,972 --> 00:47:40,204
好，我跟你说
我很支持你去画画
Well, I told you,
I'm happy to support you while you paint.

719
00:47:41,645 --> 00:47:44,273
亲爱的，我有点累了
Honey, I'm sort of tired.

720
00:47:45,182 --> 00:47:46,672
好的
Okay.

721
00:47:46,850 --> 00:47:48,875
关灯吧
Let's turn out the light, then.

722
00:47:58,562 --> 00:48:02,328
只是，可能如果我不在周围
你可以写更多的东西
It's just, maybe if I wasn't around,
you could get more writing done.

723
00:48:02,499 --> 00:48:05,559
你没有做事吗当我们第一遇见的时候
Weren't you working on something
when we first met?

724
00:48:08,772 --> 00:48:10,239
Calvin?
Calvin?

725
00:48:21,518 --> 00:48:23,350
你在做什么
What are you doing?

726
00:48:24,388 --> 00:48:26,788
收拾东西去大索尔
Just packing for Big Sur.

727
00:48:27,959 --> 00:48:29,654
真的？
Really?

728
00:48:29,827 --> 00:48:31,260
是的
Yeah.

729
00:49:16,775 --> 00:49:18,436
看看这个地方
Look at this place.

730
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:22,171
当然，这里
All right, this is it.

731
00:49:22,347 --> 00:49:24,440
你问这个
You asked for it.

732
00:49:24,616 --> 00:49:27,016
你不担心任何事
You have nothing to worry about.

733
00:49:30,889 --> 00:49:33,551
看，为什么今晚
我们不呆在别的地方呢
Look, why don't we stay
somewhere else tonight?

734
00:49:34,035 --> 00:49:37,368
只有你和我，有上千个旅馆
Just you and me. There's a thousand
bed-and-breakfasts around.

735
00:49:37,538 --> 00:49:40,029
亲爱的，很好
会很浪漫
- Honey, it's gonna be great.
- It could be romantic.

736
00:49:40,208 --> 00:49:42,301
最后
你好
- Finally.
- Hi.

737
00:49:42,477 --> 00:49:44,001
你在这里
你好
- You're here!
- Hi.

738
00:49:44,178 --> 00:49:45,202
你好
你好
- Hi.
- Hi.

739
00:49:45,379 --> 00:49:46,573
好的，
你好，Scotty
- Okay.
- Hi, Scotty.

740
00:49:46,747 --> 00:49:49,773
你好，来这里，来这里，Scotty.
好的
- Hi. Come on. Come on, Scotty.
- Okay.

741
00:49:49,951 --> 00:49:51,180
你好
你好

742
00:49:51,353 --> 00:49:52,980
你好，我是Ruby
你好，Ruby
- Hi. I'm Ruby.
- Hi, Ruby.

743
00:49:53,155 --> 00:49:54,486
Hi.

744
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:58,623
你家的公园很漂亮
Your garden is so amazing.

745
00:49:58,794 --> 00:50:01,354
所有的植物都有药用价值
All the plants have medicinal purposes.

746
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:04,055
药用
是的
- Medicinal.
- Yeah.

747
00:50:04,233 --> 00:50:06,531
很好
That is very cool.

748
00:50:11,006 --> 00:50:13,304
叹为观止
是啊
- This is incredible.
- Yeah.

749
00:50:13,475 --> 00:50:17,002
他在1980年开始做这些
他只是一直在做
He started it in 1980
and he just keeps adding to it.

750
00:50:17,179 --> 00:50:19,204
这是他的杰作
It's his masterpiece.

751
00:50:19,381 --> 00:50:20,939
这些都是Mort建造的？
是的
- Mort built all of this?
- Yeah.

752
00:50:21,116 --> 00:50:23,949
你相信这吗？
是的，我相信
- Can you believe it?
- Yes, I can.

753
00:50:24,653 --> 00:50:28,419
这是我们住的地方
And this is where we live.

754
00:50:29,124 --> 00:50:31,615
哦，天啊
Oh, my God.

755
00:50:31,793 --> 00:50:33,385
这真是太漂亮了
This is so beautiful.

756
00:50:36,165 --> 00:50:38,690
我感觉像我在寺庙一样
I feel like I'm in some kind of temple.

757
00:50:38,868 --> 00:50:43,498
天
我不能相信你说的
Oh, my God,
I can't believe you said that.

758
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:47,074
Calvin，她真准
什么？什么？什么？
- Calvin, she is so intuitive.
- What? What? What?

759
00:50:47,243 --> 00:50:50,371
Mort 从阿米什人社区拿来的木材
祝福之意
Mort got this wood from Amish land.
It was blessed.

760
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:53,778
这些砖从一个旧的天主教会学校拿来的
And the bricks come from an old
Catholic school that was torn down.

761
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:55,349
不能想象啊
That's incredible.

762
00:50:55,518 --> 00:50:57,509
楼梯，卧室
Stairway, bedroom.

763
00:50:57,687 --> 00:50:59,780
这是Harry要住的地方
That's where Harry will sleep.

764
00:50:59,956 --> 00:51:01,981
这是我的学习室，不要进去
This is my study. Don't go in there.

765
00:51:02,158 --> 00:51:04,649
我还在整理书籍
I'm re-alphabetizing.

766
00:51:04,894 --> 00:51:08,523
这是你要睡觉的地方
And this is where you'll be sleeping.

767
00:51:09,165 --> 00:51:11,861
哦，这看起来像小巢
Oh, it's like a little nest.

768
00:51:12,035 --> 00:51:15,095
妈妈，我们住在这里？没有门
Mom, we're in here? There are no doors.

769
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,771
没有人对你的事感兴趣，亲爱的
No one's interested
in your business, honey.

770
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:21,707
恩，这是浴室
Well, this is the bathroom.

771
00:51:21,879 --> 00:51:23,471
我们有自己的浴室
We have our own well.

772
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:27,782
这是Mort的工作室
This is Mort's workshop!

773
00:51:29,787 --> 00:51:32,722
他做了漂流木家具
He makes driftwood furniture!

774
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:34,289
Mort
Mort!

775
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:38,257
Mort，亲爱的，他们在这里
Mort, honey, they're here!

776
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,158
你好
Hey!

777
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:42,126
欢迎
Welcome!

778
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:43,866
他是个好孩子，好孩子
That's a good boy, good boy.

00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:46,969
他是个很好的男孩子
所以，Ruby...
- He is such a good boy.
- So, Ruby...

780
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:48,968
你去过美术学院吗

781
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:50,629
不，我没有正式练习过
No, I didn't train formally.

782
00:51:50,808 --> 00:51:52,935
我只是这学点，那学点
I just sort of picked things up
here and there.

783
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:56,739
那就是了，继续做
你会学得更多
That's right. Just do it.
You learn more that way, eh?

784
00:51:56,914 --> 00:51:58,882

Mort，你没有喂Scotty吗？

787
00:52:04,022 --> 00:52:06,547
别担心，他喜欢它
我担心它的胃
- Don't worry. He loves it.
- It'll upset his stomach.

788
00:52:06,725 --> 00:52:09,319
狗喜欢人类的食物，他们会做的

不，他们不会
他们会

在我年轻的时候，我画画
I painted when I was young.

791
00:52:12,998 --> 00:52:14,295
你画画
是的
- Did you?
- Yeah.

792
00:52:14,466 --> 00:52:16,400
Calvin从来没有跟我说过
Calvin never told me.

793
00:52:16,568 --> 00:52:18,263
他们的父亲不赞同
Well, their father didn't approve.

794
00:52:18,436 --> 00:52:19,903
因为她画裸体

各种位置
- Nudes.

796
00:52:21,973 --> 00:52:23,440

797
00:52:23,608 --> 00:52:26,406
我觉得他们很性感，Harry.
I think they are very sexy, Harry.

798
00:52:26,578 --> 00:52:29,706
Mort鼓励我再次画画
Mort's been encouraging me
to take it up again.

799

908
00:57:45,804 --> 00:57:47,271
他真英俊。
He's so handsome.

909
00:57:47,439 --> 00:57:51,034
是的，非常非常的，
就像凯文一样。
Yes, and very, very serious,
just like Calvin.

910
00:57:51,409 --> 00:57:53,001
- 他是一个高尔夫选手吗？
- 鲁比？
- He was a golfer?
- Ruby?

911
00:57:53,645 --> 00:57:55,442
- 什么...？嘿。
- 鲁比，去睡觉。
- Wha...? Hey.
- Ruby, bed.

912
00:57:55,613 --> 00:57:56,638
- 现在？
- 是的。
- Right now?
- Yes.

913
00:57:56,816 --> 00:57:58,716
你为什么不要呢？
Why won't you take it?

914
00:57:58,884 --> 00:58:00,408
我想你接受它。
I want you to have it.

915
00:58:00,586 --> 00:58:04,249
- 怎么了？
- 凯文不想要我的礼物。
- What's going on?
- Calvin won't accept my present.

916
00:58:04,423 --> 00:58:05,549
为什么不呢？
Why not?

917
00:58:05,725 --> 00:58:08,660
- 莫特做家具做的很用心。
- 是啊。
- Mort works hard on his furniture.
- Yeah.

918
00:58:08,828 --> 00:58:12,389
- 我叫它孤松椅。
- 它真漂亮。
- I call it the Lone Pine.
- That's beautiful.

919
00:58:12,565 --> 00:58:16,228
- 你不喜欢吗？
- 当然，他喜欢。这是一个很棒的椅子。
- Don't you like it?
- Of course, he does. It's a great chair.

920
00:58:16,402 --> 00:58:19,166
到这来，坐下，坐下。
好好感觉这个木头。
Come on, sit down, sit down.
Just feel the wood.

921
00:58:19,338 --> 00:58:20,930
加尔文...
Calvin...

922
00:58:42,362 --> 00:58:44,557

929
00:59:00,614 --> 00:59:02,309
宝贝，我在读书。
Honey, I'm trying to read.

930
00:59:15,162 --> 00:59:16,652
鲁比？
Ruby?

931
00:59:20,133 --> 00:59:23,330
你整个周末都在读你那本无聊的书。
You read your stupid book all weekend.

932
00:59:24,838 --> 00:59:27,865
你的妈妈和莫特如此的努力。
Your mom and Mort were trying so hard.

933
00:59:28,042 --> 00:59:29,839
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

934
00:59:41,689 --> 00:59:44,249
你没有任何朋友。
You don't have any friends.

935
00:59:44,592 --> 00:59:46,025
我有你。
I have you.

936
00:59:46,527 --> 00:59:48,757
我不需要别的其他人。
I don't need anyone else.

937
00:59:49,497 --> 00:59:51,692
这是一个很大的压力。
That's a lot of pressure.

938
00:59:54,435 --> 00:59:58,838
-我好寂寞。
-不要。求你不要说这些。
- I'm so lonely.
- No. Don't say that. Please.

939
01:00:02,009 --> 01:00:03,033
我们该怎么办？
What do we do?

940
01:00:04,946 --> 01:00:07,141
我们该如何使它变得更好？
How do we make it better?

941
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:12,282
-也许我需要上节艺术课。
-好极了。
- Maybe I could take an art class.
- Great.

942
01:00:12,454 --> 01:00:16,515
一节美术课。从家里走出去。
这很好。
An art class. Get out of the house.
It's good.

943
01:00:17,559 --> 01:00:21,928
我想我需要再一次花费一些夜晚在我的公寓里面。
And I think I should start spending
some nights at my apartment again.

944
01:00:22,397 --> 01:00:24,331
你的公寓？
Your apartment?

945
01:00:25,434 --> 01:00:27,061
一个星期一晚上。
One night a week.

946
01:00:27,636 --> 01:00:29,661
作为试验。
As an experiment.

947
01:00:33,208 --> 01:00:35,073
好吧。
Okay.

948
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:50,954
嗨，Scotty.到这儿来。
Hi, Scotty. Come here.

949
01:00:56,166 --> 01:00:57,861
这个老师真惊人。
The teacher's just amazing.

950
01:00:58,034 --> 01:01:03,028
这是一个大龄小组，
不过这里的个人水平都很高。
It's kind of an older group,
but the talent level's really high.

951
01:01:03,506 --> 01:01:05,838
我想我将会学到很多。
I think I'm gonna learn a lot.

952
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:12,205
-你的夜晚怎么样？
-糟糕透了。
- How was your night?
- Terrible.

953
01:01:12,382 --> 01:01:14,213
抱歉。
I'm sorry.

954
01:01:14,384 --> 01:01:17,376
我不认为这个试验将要为我工作的。
I don't think this experiment
is gonna work for me.

955
01:01:18,922 --> 01:01:21,618
在这关系里面肯定要留一些私人空间。
There has to be space
in the relationship.

956
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:24,954
否则，
这就像我们是一样的人了。
Otherwise,
it's like we're the same person.

957
01:01:25,695 --> 01:01:29,153
听着，这是每个星期只有一个夜晚。
我觉得你可以处理它。
Listen, it's one night a week.
I think you can handle it.

958
01:01:29,766 --> 01:01:31,791
我必须去洗个澡了。
I've gotta take a shower.

959
01:01:33,803 --> 01:01:35,464
来吧，宝贝。
Come on, baby.

960
01:01:54,425 --> 01:01:55,449
哈喽？
Hello?

961
01:01:55,626 --> 01:01:57,719
-嗨。
-嗨。你在哪里？
- Hi.
- Hi. Where are you?

962
01:01:58,162 --> 01:02:03,794
我们班上的人决定到外面玩，
因此我们正在酒吧里面。
A bunch of people from class
decided to go out, so we're at this bar.

963
01:02:03,968 --> 01:02:05,560
你什么时候回家？
When you coming home?

964
01:02:05,736 --> 01:02:08,102
我不知道。我们才刚刚到这里。
I don't know. We just got here.

965
01:02:08,572 --> 01:02:10,369
我已经做过饭了。
I cooked.

966
01:02:11,175 --> 01:02:14,508
抱歉，不。你知道，
我以为我们将在这里吃。
Sorry, no. You know,
I think that we're just gonna eat here.

967
01:02:14,678 --> 01:02:16,509
我的意思是，我们已经好了，因此...
I mean, we already ordered, so...

968
01:02:18,916 --> 01:02:20,907
那么你什么时候回家？
So when are you coming home?

969
01:02:21,085 --> 01:02:25,455
我不知道。你的位置稍微有点远，
而且我们喝了点酒，因此...
I don't know. Your place is kind of far
and we're drinking, so...

970
01:02:27,225 --> 01:02:29,989
你知道，我认为现在稍微有点迟了。
You know, I might be kind of late.

971
01:02:30,161 --> 01:02:32,629
为什么我们不明天见面呢？
Why don't we just see each other
tomorrow?

972
01:02:35,834 --> 01:02:39,235
-凯文？
-在。
- Calvin?
- Yeah.

973
01:02:39,738 --> 01:02:43,799
好吧。祝你玩的愉快。
Okay. Have a great time.

974
01:04:17,371 --> 01:04:20,033
凯文，我想回家。
Calvin, I wanna come home.

975
01:04:26,646 --> 01:04:30,013
-不。
-我想去尿尿。
- No.
- I have to pee.

976
01:04:30,317 --> 01:04:32,148
待在这。
Stay.

977
01:04:58,813 --> 01:05:01,281
我现在想你了。
I miss you right now.

978
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:07,781
噢，凯文。
Oh, Calvin.

979
01:05:10,224 --> 01:05:12,954
-我宁愿不讨论它
-我很抱歉。
- I'd rather not talk about it.
- I'm sorry.

980
01:05:13,327 --> 01:05:15,192
我总是以为你是孤独一个人。
I always thought you walked alone.

981
01:05:15,630 --> 01:05:18,531
没有人会选择孤独一生。
No man walks alone from choice.

982
01:05:21,103 --> 01:05:23,196
-你要去哪里？
-去接个电话。
- Where are you going?
- To get the phone.

983
01:05:23,372 --> 01:05:25,397
我能和你一起去吗？
Can I come with you?

984
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:43,148
两张7:45的票。
Two for the 7:45.

985
01:05:43,325 --> 01:05:45,987
已经卖完了，9:00还有。
It's sold out. There's a 9:00.

986
01:05:46,395 --> 01:05:48,488
先去散散步吧？
Take a walk first?

987
01:05:49,798 --> 01:05:51,663
2张9点的票。
Two for the 9.

988
01:06:01,810 --> 01:06:03,369
看这个。
Look at this.

989
01:06:12,155 --> 01:06:13,179
哈喽？
Hello?

990
01:06:13,356 --> 01:06:15,290
看谁回他们的电话。
Look who answered their phone.

991
01:06:15,458 --> 01:06:17,790
塞勒斯，嘿。
抱歉，我最近一直很忙。
Cyrus, hey. Sorry, I've been busy.

992
01:06:17,961 --> 01:06:21,226
-没关系，伙计。在忙写作？
-是啊。
- No worries, man. Busy writing?
- Yeah.

993
01:06:21,397 --> 01:06:24,491
是吗？太好了，太棒了。
我一直在给他们说你正在写作。
Yeah? Good, that's great.
I keep telling them you're working on it.

994
01:06:24,667 --> 01:06:27,192
出版商也越来越着急新书...
The publishers are getting anxious
about the new book...

995
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:28,394
对呢，这新书。
Right, the new book.

996
01:06:28,571 --> 01:06:32,268
- 前段时间你对新书很激动...
- 我在外面呢...
- You seemed excited about it a while back...
- I'm out right now...

997
01:06:32,442 --> 01:06:35,104
有什么进展没有？
我能给他们一个大概的完成时间吗...?
Any progress since then?
Can I give them some time line...?

998
01:06:35,278 --> 01:06:38,042
- 塞勒斯，我过会再打给你。
-什么？
- Cyrus, I'm gonna call you back.
- What?

999
01:06:40,283 --> 01:06:42,046
鲁比？
Ruby?

1000
01:06:47,358 --> 01:06:49,019
鲁比！
Ruby!

1001
01:06:53,864 --> 01:06:55,855
鲁比！
Ruby!

1002
01:07:03,774 --> 01:07:07,437
嘿。嘿。嘿。发生什么了？
我一转身你就不见了。
Hey. Hey, hey. What happened?
I turned around and you were gone.

1003
01:07:07,611 --> 01:07:09,841
- 你松开了我的手。
- 我...什么？
- You let go of my hand.
- I... What?

1004
01:07:10,014 --> 01:07:11,845
你松开了我的手。
You let go of my hand.

1005
01:07:12,016 --> 01:07:15,611
什么...？我得接个电话。
What...? I had to pick up the phone.

1006
01:07:15,786 --> 01:07:18,380
- 我知道，但是你放开了。
- 鲁比。
- I know, but you let go.
- Ruby.

1007
01:07:18,822 --> 01:07:22,622
你甚至没有注意到我不见了。
You didn't even notice I was gone.

1008
01:07:23,093 --> 01:07:24,720
鲁比。
Ruby.

1009
01:07:24,895 --> 01:07:27,887
宝贝，平静下来。
Sweetie, you have to calm down.

1010
01:07:31,068 --> 01:07:34,527
- 我去给你倒些水，行吗？
- 不要离开。
- I'm gonna get you some water, okay?
- No.

1011
01:07:35,173 --> 01:07:37,232
-不要走。
-我马上回来。
- No.
- I'll be right back.

1012
01:08:07,906 --> 01:08:09,897
嗨，小笨蛋
Hi, dummy.

1013
01:08:12,277 --> 01:08:13,767
嗨。
Hi.

1014
01:08:15,848 --> 01:08:21,445
他在追我...不要。
He's chasing me... No.

1015
01:08:21,787 --> 01:08:25,279
迈尔斯。耶。迈尔斯。
Miles. Yay, Miles.

1016
01:08:25,458 --> 01:08:27,483
- 谢谢。
- 他是一个水做的的宝宝。
- Thanks.
- He's a water baby.

1017
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:29,719
- 我能问你一些事情吗？
- 我能帮你什么。
- Can I ask something?
- I'm coming to get you.

1018
01:08:29,895 --> 01:08:31,055
问吧。
Shoot.

1019
01:08:32,665 --> 01:08:35,657
- 要是我告诉你我又重新开始写作了，你会怎么想？
- 哦，不要，他在踢我。
- What if I told you I was writing again?
- Oh, no, he kicked me.

1020
01:08:35,835 --> 01:08:36,995
嘿，这很棒啊。
Hey, that's fantastic.

1021
01:08:37,603 --> 01:08:40,231
你准备写些什么呢？
What's it about?

1022
01:08:41,507 --> 01:08:43,134
重新开始写。
Writing again.

1023
01:08:43,309 --> 01:08:46,107
棒极了！ 喵！喵！喵！
All right! Meow! Meow! Meow!

1024
01:08:46,278 --> 01:08:48,508
- 噢，嗨。
- 进行的怎么样了？
- Oh. Hi.
- How's it going?

1025
01:08:48,681 --> 01:08:49,705
不错。
Good.

1026
01:08:49,882 --> 01:08:51,816
- 她还是很生气？
- 不。
- Her tits?
- No.

1027
01:08:53,219 --> 01:08:54,982
她只是不高兴。
She wasn't happy.

1028
01:08:56,222 --> 01:08:58,520
- 因此我想使她高兴起来...
- 我是皇后！
- So I made her happy...
- I'm a queen!

1029
01:08:58,691 --> 01:09:00,523
现在她就整天都想这样。
And now she's like this all the time.

1030
01:09:02,696 --> 01:09:05,494
你想问我什么呢？
如果是道德上面的？我不知道。
What are you asking me?
If it's moral? I don't know.

1031
01:09:06,099 --> 01:09:08,363
这显然有效。
It's obviously working.

1032
01:09:08,802 --> 01:09:09,996
就把它当做百解忧。
Think of it like Prozac.

1033
01:09:10,337 --> 01:09:13,829
- 但是你怎么知道她是不是真的快乐？
- 她是假的，明白吗？她没有真正的快乐。
- But how do I know it's real?
- It's not, okay? She's not.

1034
01:09:14,007 --> 01:09:15,872
她 我... 她曾经很快乐。
She I... She was.

1035
01:09:16,043 --> 01:09:17,840
噢，不要。
Oh, no.

1036
01:09:18,011 --> 01:09:20,707
- 我想让她真正的快乐起来...
- 我爱你，宝贝。
- I want to be what's making her happy...
- I love you, baby.

1037
01:09:20,881 --> 01:09:22,781
而不是制造成她很快乐。
Without making her happy.

1038
01:09:23,083 --> 01:09:25,643
那么就把鲁比写回到普通的样子。
没有什么大不了的。
So write "Ruby went back to normal."
No big deal.

1039
01:09:25,819 --> 01:09:28,344
我是一只小公狗，快乐的在水中游泳。
I'm a puppy dog swimming in the water.

1040
01:09:28,522 --> 01:09:30,513
之前我以为她会离开我。
I think she was gonna leave me before.

1041
01:09:30,691 --> 01:09:34,559
救命。救命。
Help. Help.

1042
01:09:38,598 --> 01:09:40,691
苏西曾经离开过。
Susie left once.

1043
01:09:41,001 --> 01:09:44,233
什么时候？为什么你没有告诉我？
When? Why didn't you tell me?

1044
01:09:44,405 --> 01:09:46,600
你当时很忙。
You had a lot going on.

1045
01:09:46,774 --> 01:09:47,798
后来她又回来了。
And she came back.

1046
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:50,871
但是我仍然想着这件事。
But I still think about it.

1047
01:09:51,045 --> 01:09:52,910
我随时可能失去她。
I could lose her any moment.

1048
01:10:13,601 --> 01:10:16,161
踩到一个裂缝，
打破你妈妈的背。
Step on a crack,
break your mother's back.

1049
01:10:19,674 --> 01:10:22,700
我正在考虑离开几个月。
I'm thinking about going away
for a few months.

1050
01:10:22,877 --> 01:10:25,869
- 只有我自己。
- 你想去哪里呢？
- By myself.
- Where do you wanna go?

1051
01:10:28,183 --> 01:10:31,380
我不知道，一些远一点的地方。
I don't know. Somewhere far.

1052
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:36,118
你可以给我寄明信片。
我非常喜欢搜信。
You could send me postcards.
I love getting mail.

1053
01:10:37,726 --> 01:10:41,127
或者我也可以躲在屋里面，
甚至不出门。
Or I might hole up here in the house,
not even go outside.

1054
01:10:41,296 --> 01:10:42,786
挺酷的。
Cool.

1055
01:10:42,965 --> 01:10:45,798
我们可以用枕头做一个城堡。
We could build a pillow fort.

1056
01:11:24,207 --> 01:11:26,903
这是你的证明自己的舞台。从你开始，米歇尔。
This is your proving
ground. Start with you, Michelle.

1057
01:11:27,076 --> 01:11:29,442
- 好吧。
- 你有一个优美的步伐。
- Yes.
- You have a superior walk.

1058
01:11:29,612 --> 01:11:31,944
- 我能在走台上看见你，但是...
- 谢谢你。
- I can see you doing runway, but...
- Thank you.

1059
01:11:32,115 --> 01:11:34,106
你在做什么呢？
我们准备去参加 Langdon的派对。
What are you doing?
We have's party.

1060
01:11:34,284 --> 01:11:35,876
- 谁？
- Langdon Tharp
- Who?
- Langdon Tharp.

1061
01:11:36,052 --> 01:11:39,044
- 那个作家，今天晚上是他的新书派对。
- 嘿，我正在看这个。
- The writer. His book party's tonight.
- Hey, I was watching that.

1062
01:11:39,222 --> 01:11:41,554
- 是啊，好几天了。
- 这就像一个马拉松。
- Yeah, for days.
- It's a marathon.

1063
01:11:41,724 --> 01:11:44,318
你总是让我去给我们拟定计划，我做了。
You were always asking me
to make plans for us. I did.

1064
01:11:44,494 --> 01:11:48,260
不要用我的话，来对付我自己。
我有权改变自己的想法。
Don't quote me to myself.
I am allowed to change my mind.

1065
01:11:48,431 --> 01:11:52,663
- 我不想因为这个吵架。
- 好吧，那太好了！让我们忽略它吧，然后。
- I don't want to fight about this.
- Fine, great! Let's ignore it, then.

1066
01:11:52,836 --> 01:11:55,361
现在看看希拉吧。
希拉看起来这么的与众不同。
Now look at Sheila.
Sheila has such a unique look.

1067
01:11:55,538 --> 01:11:58,372
我认为这个棒极了。
我们都可以注意到。
And I think that's wonderful.
We've all noticed it.

1068
01:12:00,144 --> 01:12:01,839
我们爱你的干劲。
We love your energy.

1069
01:12:02,012 --> 01:12:05,140
萨利的大发髻也非常的有趣...
Sally made a really interesting
choice using that big tease...

1070
01:12:05,316 --> 01:12:06,374
但是它太大了。
but it was too much.

1071
01:12:06,550 --> 01:12:09,110
她真够大胆的。
She's not afraid to be bold.

1072
01:12:15,893 --> 01:12:17,952
抱歉。
I'm sorry.

1073
01:12:21,732 --> 01:12:25,168
你最近做什么事都一上一下的，你知道吗？
Everything's been so up and down lately,
you know?

1074
01:12:27,304 --> 01:12:30,865
就像没有了内心的指南针。
It's like my internal compass
is just gone.

1075
01:12:34,979 --> 01:12:36,810
也许我应该找人谈谈。
Maybe I should talk to someone.

1076
01:12:36,981 --> 01:12:39,973
你过去找过人吗？
You used to see someone, didn't you?

1077
01:12:40,150 --> 01:12:42,517
罗森塔尔医生
Dr. Rosenthal.

1078
01:12:43,054 --> 01:12:45,454
也许你应该回去。
Maybe you should go back.

1079
01:12:46,658 --> 01:12:48,455
我想我们都正在谈论你。
I thought we were talking about you.

1080
01:12:50,028 --> 01:12:53,191
是啊，是啊，我们是在。
Yeah, yeah, we are.

1081
01:12:54,432 --> 01:12:57,595
也许你是对的。
也许我应该出去走走了。
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I just need to get out.

1082
01:12:57,769 --> 01:13:00,431
见一些陌生人，交一些朋友。
See people. Be social.

1083
01:13:01,973 --> 01:13:03,838
这个派对很有趣。
This party's gonna be fun.

1084
01:13:09,681 --> 01:13:12,548
Langdon. Hey, Langdon, hey.

1085
01:13:12,717 --> 01:13:14,412
欢迎来到我的地方。
Welcome to my cult.

1086
01:13:14,586 --> 01:13:17,714
- 卡尔，你应该和亚当和曼迪谈谈。
- 谁？
- Cal, you have to talk to Adam and Mandi.
- Who?

1087
01:13:17,889 --> 01:13:20,756
亚当和曼迪。
想买你书的版权的制作人。
Adam and Mandi. The producers
who wanna take over your option.

1088
01:13:20,926 --> 01:13:23,622
- 请，检查你的短信。
- 塞勒斯，这是鲁比。
- Please, check your messages.
- Cyrus, this is Ruby.

1089
01:13:23,795 --> 01:13:25,320
- 嗨。
- 鲁比。
- Hi.
- Ruby.

1090
01:13:25,498 --> 01:13:27,227
塞勒斯。
很高兴认识你。
Cyrus. Nice.

1091
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:28,924
- 这是莎斯基亚
- 嗨。
- This is Saskia.
- Hi.

1092
01:13:29,101 --> 01:13:30,728
- 好了，走吧。
- 嗨。
- Okay. Come.
- Hi.

1093
01:13:30,903 --> 01:13:33,201
待在这，我马上回来。
Stay there, I'll be right back.

1094
01:13:36,776 --> 01:13:38,744
你想亲自来写剧本吗？
You wanna write
the screenplay yourself?

1095
01:13:38,911 --> 01:13:41,539
嗯，当然。是的，绝对的。
不然谁写？
Oh, of course. Yes, absolutely.
Who else would?

1096
01:13:41,714 --> 01:13:43,682
我不知道。我从来没有写过。
I don't know. I've never written one.

1097
01:13:43,849 --> 01:13:46,511
天哪，你真是一个天才，
你只要像这样完成它。
My God, you're such a genius,
you'd pick it up like that.

1098
01:13:46,686 --> 01:13:49,280
- 我将会告诉他那个。
- 他不喜欢这个消息的。
- I've been telling him that.
- He doesn't like that word.

1099
01:13:49,455 --> 01:13:50,888
你想让谁来演查理？
Who'd you wanna play Charlie?

1100
01:13:51,057 --> 01:13:53,287
- 我的意思是，这就是问题所在，对吧？
- 对啊。
- I mean, that's the question, right?
- Yeah.

1101
01:13:59,065 --> 01:14:01,863
你应该过来，和我谈谈关于它的一些事情。
You should come
and talk to me about it sometime.

1102
01:14:10,644 --> 01:14:	14,080
现在，亚当和曼迪过来和我分享纪录片的经验。
Now, Adam and Mandi come in
with experience from documentary films.

1103
01:14:14,247 --> 01:14:15,407
好吧。
Yeah.

1104
01:14:15,582 --> 01:14:18,050
他们接触所有的东西都是真实的。
他们把他拍的很真实。
Everything they touch is authentic.
They make it real.

1105
01:14:18,218 --> 01:14:21,517
- 他们拍的基于现实...
- 我们对于故事也保持了真实性...
- Grounded in reality and...
- We treat narrative the exact same way...

1106
01:14:21,688 --> 01:14:23,747
- 你看了他们做的那个关于婴儿的纪录片了吗。
- 看了。
- You saw the baby documentary they did.
- Yes.

1107
01:14:23,924 --> 01:14:26,017
- 不错，棒极了。
- 使我想有个小孩。
- Okay. Genius.
- Made me wanna have a kid.

1108
01:14:26,193 --> 01:14:28,787
你不知道有多少的人说过了这句话。
You have no idea how many people
told us the same thing.

1109
01:14:28,962 --> 01:14:31,692
-不错，这很好。
- 我可以拿去看一会吗？
- Well, it's true.
- Can you hold this just for a second?

1110
01:14:31,865 --> 01:14:34,129
- 不，抱歉， 我要离开一会儿。
- 好吧，去吧。
- No, sorry, I'll be right back.
- Yeah, absolutely.

1111
01:14:34,301 --> 01:14:35,598
- 很高兴和你讲话。
- 我也是。
- Great to talk to you.
- Okay.

1112
01:14:35,769 --> 01:14:37,066
- 过一会在谈吧
- 好的。
- Talk to you in a bit.
- Okay.

1113
01:14:37,237 --> 01:14:39,398
- 待会见。 嗯，好的。
- 好的。
- See you later. Yeah, great.
- Okay.

1114
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:42,608
打扰一下，抱歉。
Excuse me. Sorry.

1115
01:14:45,012 --> 01:14:47,776
- 卡尔。
- 莱拉。
- Cal.
- Lila.

1116
01:14:50,017 --> 01:14:51,609
我以为你在纽约呢。
I thought you were in New York.

1117
01:14:51,785 --> 01:14:55,017
没，Landgon正在帮助我出版我的小说。
No, Landgon's helping me
publish my novel.

1118
01:14:55,823 --> 01:14:57,290
你要出版你的小说。
You finished your novel.

1119
01:14:57,458 --> 01:15:01,758
我知道，这是一个很大的惊喜，这个...
你这半吊子居然写完了小说，对吗？
I know, it's a big surprise, the...
The dilettante finished something, right?

1120
01:15:02,096 --> 01:15:03,120
我从来没有说过这些。
I never said that.

1121
01:15:04,532 --> 01:15:07,831
- 你怎么样？你还在写作吗？
- 当然。
- What about you? Are you writing?
- Sure.

1122
01:15:08,002 --> 01:15:10,971
不错。棒极了。
Good. Great.

1123
01:15:11,572 --> 01:15:14,234
- 我听说你看中了某个人？
- 是啊，她在那。
- I hear you're seeing someone?
- Yeah. She's here.

1124
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:16,036
打扰一下。
Excuse me.

1125
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:17,768
- 她是一个作家吗？
- 不是。
- Is she a writer?
- No.

1126
01:15:17,945 --> 01:15:19,845
不，一个画家。
No, a painter.

1127
01:15:20,014 --> 01:15:24,041
棒极了。这真不坏。
That's great. It's very unthreatening.

1128
01:15:25,486 --> 01:15:27,420
你认为你威胁到我了吗？
You think I was threatened by you?

1129
01:15:28,089 --> 01:15:30,557
不，卡尔，为什么这么说？
你是一个天才。
No, Cal, why would you be?
You're a genius.

1130
01:15:35,930 --> 01:15:37,865
喜欢我的泳池吗？
You like my pool?

1131
01:15:39,735 --> 01:15:42,169
- 我们见过吗？
- 我不这样认为。
- Do I know you?
- I don't think so.

1132
01:15:42,771 --> 01:15:45,103
你在我的派对上做什么呢？
What are you doing at my party?

1133
01:15:46,008 --> 01:15:47,805
你告诉我吧。
You tell me.

1134
01:15:48,077 --> 01:15:49,510
你和谁一起来的？
You come with someone?

1135
01:15:49,678 --> 01:15:51,976
凯文 韦尔 菲尔德。
Calvin Weir-Fields.

1136
01:15:52,147 --> 01:15:54,411
这个天才少年。
The boy wonder.

1137
01:15:54,583 --> 01:15:58,519
你是一个只和女孩约会的那类作家吗？
So are you one of those girls
who only dates famous writers?

1138
01:15:59,021 --> 01:16:01,182
为什么？你是一个著名的作家吗？
Why? Are you a famous writer?

1139
01:16:02,024 --> 01:16:04,049
你可以告诉我你的名字吗？
Do you happen to have a name?

1140
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:07,593
-鲁比。
-鲁比。
- Ruby.
- Ruby.

1141
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:09,959
你是做什么的，鲁比？
And what do you do, Ruby?

1142
01:16:10,799 --> 01:16:12,460
没什么。
Nothing.

1143
01:16:14,203 --> 01:16:17,969
真新鲜的回答。
你在你的空闲时间都在做什么呢？
How refreshing.
What do you do in your spare time?

1144
01:16:20,642 --> 01:16:22,543
没什么。
Not much.

1145
01:16:23,313 --> 01:16:26,578
你知道，我一直在想，
我只是一直在思考...
You know, I was thinking,
I was just thinking...

1146
01:16:26,749 --> 01:16:29,343
今晚真适合游泳。
tonight would be perfect for a swim.

1147
01:16:30,019 --> 01:16:31,987
我没有带泳衣。
I don't have a suit.

1148
01:16:33,389 --> 01:16:35,516
这是一个问题吗？
Is that a problem?

1149
01:16:37,961 --> 01:16:41,328
没关系。我不知道为什么我会觉得
你会为我高兴。
Never mind. I don't know why
I thought maybe you'd be happy for me.

1150
01:16:41,498 --> 01:16:43,363
我除了支持你什么也没有做。
How was I anything but supportive?

1151
01:16:43,533 --> 01:16:45,660
我读了每一份草稿。
我把你放进了我的圈子。
I read every draft.
I took you into my group.

1152
01:16:45,835 --> 01:16:47,803
- 我把你介绍给了Langdon.
- 小气鬼。
- I introduced you to Langdon.
- Begrudgingly.

1153
01:16:47,971 --> 01:16:50,565
- 什么？我听不见你说什么。
- 小气鬼。
- What? I literally can't hear you.
- Begrudgingly.

1154
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:52,867
你对我一点点都没有兴趣。
你从来没有。
You weren't curious about me.
You never were.

1155
01:16:53,543 --> 01:16:55,511
你只是对我是谁很有意见。
You just had this image of who I was.

1156
01:16:55,678 --> 01:16:58,841
并且无论我做什么，你都视而不见。
And anything that I did
that contradicted it, you just ignored.

1157
01:16:59,015 --> 01:17:01,813
什么意见？当我不出名的时候马上离开我？
What image? Where you left me
as soon as I wasn't successful?

1158
01:17:01,985 --> 01:17:05,284
你认为如果你出名了，我配不上你？
You think I gave a shit
if you were famous?

1159
01:17:06,023 --> 01:17:09,151
我想从你那里得到什么，
我不知道，我只想要你的关心。
All that I wanted was for you,
I don't know, to care about me.

1160
01:17:09,326 --> 01:17:12,159
关心你吗？
我的爸爸才死几个星期，你就离开了我。
Care about you?
You left weeks after my father died.

1161
01:17:12,329 --> 01:17:14,229
- 你想要谈论这件事吗？
- 噢，老天啊。
- Do you wanna talk about caring?
- Oh, God.

1162
01:17:14,398 --> 01:17:16,832
- 你知道人们怎么说你的吗？
- 你这是不可理喻。
- Do you know what people say?
- You were impenetrable.

1163
01:17:17,001 --> 01:17:19,196
- “你怎么会爱上这种人?”
- 我失踪去解释。
- "How'd you love that person?"
- I tried to help.

1164
01:17:19,370 --> 01:17:22,430
- 你拒绝我进入你的内线。
- 我只能说，“我他妈也不知道！”
- You refused to let me in.
- And I say, "I have no fucking clue!"

1165
01:17:27,278 --> 01:17:32,113
你唯一想交流的人，就是你自己。
The only person that you wanted to be
in a relationship with was you.

1166
01:17:34,451 --> 01:17:36,282
因此我让你做这些。
So I let you do that.

1167
01:17:38,989 --> 01:17:41,981
你真是会把自己撇的干干净净，不是吗？
You really let yourself off the hook,
don't you?

1168
01:17:46,030 --> 01:17:47,395
- 再见，卡尔。
- 拜拜。
- Goodbye, Cal.
- Goodbye.

1169
01:17:48,065 --> 01:17:49,999
祝你过得幸福。
Have a great life.

1170
01:17:50,802 --> 01:17:52,736
来吧。
这水温暖舒适，向我游过来吧。
Come on.
It's nice and warm. Swim to me.

1171
01:17:53,205 --> 01:17:55,605
你可以穿着内衣裤，如果你想的话。
You can keep your underwear on
if you like.

1172
01:17:55,774 --> 01:17:56,866
快过来吧。
Come on in.

1173
01:17:57,609 --> 01:18:00,840
- 不准偷看。
- 好吧，我发誓，我不偷看。
- No peeking.
- All right, I promise, I won't peek.

1174
01:18:01,012 --> 01:18:02,775
好吧。
All right.

1175
01:18:05,050 --> 01:18:06,642
噢，伙计。
Oh, boy.

1176
01:18:10,388 --> 01:18:12,948
写作是感性的，它是...
Writing is sensual. It's...

1177
01:18:13,458 --> 01:18:15,892
当我写作的时候，你应该看着我。
我看起来就像奥利匹斯众神。
You should see me when I write.
I'm like an Olympian.

1178
01:18:16,061 --> 01:18:18,188
- 噢，真的？
- 我挥舞着我的笔...
- Oh, really?
- I wield my pen...

1179
01:18:18,363 --> 01:18:20,092
- 你的笔？
-...就像光剑。
- Your pen?
- ...like a lightsaber.

1180
01:18:20,265 --> 01:18:23,063
- 你们在这里干什么？
-凯文。
- What's going on here?
- Calvin.

1181
01:18:23,235 --> 01:18:25,726
我们...我们就在这里泡泡澡。
We... We thought we'd take a dip.

1182
01:18:27,239 --> 01:18:29,469
要不要和我们一起来？
Care to join us?

1183
01:18:42,488 --> 01:18:44,422
- 那是什么？
- 什么是什么？
- What was that?
- What was what?

1184
01:18:44,590 --> 01:18:46,524
- 你知道我在说什么。
- 大惊小怪。
- You know what.
- Grow up.

1185
01:18:46,692 --> 01:18:48,387
斯考特
Scotty.

1186
01:18:48,828 --> 01:18:51,228
-嗨。
-嗨！你弄痛了我。
- Hey.
- Hey! You're hurting me.

1187
01:18:51,397 --> 01:18:53,024
能解释一下你刚刚在做什么。
Explain what you were doing.

1188
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:55,861
你把我一个人留在了一个我完全陌生的派对。
You left me alone at a party
where I didn't know anyone.

1189
01:18:56,035 --> 01:18:59,300
- 我找了一个能说话的人。
- 仅仅只穿着你的内衣。
- I found someone to talk to.
- In your underwear.

1190
01:18:59,472 --> 01:19:01,804
以前我穿比基尼的时候，你生气过吗？
Would you have been mad
if I had been in my bikini?

1191
01:19:01,974 --> 01:19:03,669
你刚刚穿的不是比基尼。
You weren't wearing your bikini.

1192
01:19:03,843 --> 01:19:05,333
你知道看起来像什么？
Do you know what it looked like?

1193
01:19:05,511 --> 01:19:07,775
我的经纪人在那里，我的前女友也在那里。
My agent was there. My ex was there.

1194
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:10,671
莱拉在哪里？为什么你不告诉我？
Lila was there? Why didn't you tell me?

1195
01:19:10,850 --> 01:19:13,512
我正忙着让你把衣服穿上。
I was too busy getting you
to put your clothes back on.

1196
01:19:13,686 --> 01:19:16,450
- 你应该看起来是我的女朋友
- 我就是你的女朋友。
- You're supposed to be my girlfriend.
- I am your girlfriend.

1197
01:19:16,622 --> 01:19:17,646
那你就表现的像一点。
So act like it.

1198
01:19:17,823 --> 01:19:21,351
我很抱歉没有表现的像你的理想情人。
I'm sorry I wasn't acting
like the platonic ideal of your girlfriend.

1199
01:19:22,229 --> 01:19:24,754
上帝啊，你这是太大惊小怪了。
Jesus, you can be such a fucking prude.

1200
01:19:24,931 --> 01:19:26,831
只是因为我不想你和男人们一起裸体游泳？
I don't want you skinny-dipping
with men?

1201
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,798
因为你不什么也不让我做!
Because you don't want me
doing anything!

1202
01:19:29,970 --> 01:19:32,666
你有太多的规定，
并且还不告诉我它们是...
You have all these rules
and you don't tell me what they are...

1203
01:19:32,839 --> 01:19:34,704
直到，我打破你定的规矩。
until, whoops, I've broken one.

1204
01:19:34,875 --> 01:19:37,400
然后你就开始对我失望了吗？
And then you get to be disappointed
with me?

1205
01:19:37,577 --> 01:19:39,238
好吧，你想知道我定下的规则吗？
Okay. Do you wanna know my rules?

1206
01:19:39,413 --> 01:19:42,507
不要招惹其他男人。
也不要让那些男人招惹你。
Don't fuck other men.
Don't let them think about fucking you.

1207
01:19:42,683 --> 01:19:44,617
现在我还得对那些男人的想法负责任吗？
Now I'm responsible
for what people think?

1208
01:19:44,785 --> 01:19:48,414
是的，你要负责。 当你的行为，已经影响到别人的时候。
Yes, you are responsible. When you act
a certain way, it leads people on.

1209
01:19:48,588 --> 01:19:52,024
当你在派对上面脱了你的衣服的时候，
他们都以为你是一个荡妇。
When you take your clothes off at a party,
people think you're a slut.

1210
01:19:52,192 --> 01:19:57,061
因此我真的宁愿你没有做这些。
现在你清楚了吗？
So I'd really prefer if you didn't do that.
Is that clear enough for you?

1211
01:19:57,230 --> 01:19:59,198
檫
Fuck you!

1212
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:05,369
我不是你的孩子！
I'm not your child!

1213
01:20:06,407 --> 01:20:09,570
你没有权利去决定我做什么。
You don't get to decide what I do.

1214
01:20:10,611 --> 01:20:13,341
- 要打赌吗？
- 什么？
- Wanna bet?
- What?

1215
01:20:14,415 --> 01:20:17,407
我相当确定我能使你做我想你做的事情。
I'm pretty sure I could make you do
whatever I want.

1216
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:22,014
你想做什么呢，凯文？
把我捆绑起来？
What are you gonna do, Calvin?
Tie me up?

1217
01:20:22,190 --> 01:20:23,680
不。
No.

1218
01:20:25,093 --> 01:20:27,084
我不需要这么做。
I don't have to.

1219
01:21:14,209 --> 01:21:15,870
凯文...
Calvin...

1220
01:21:18,313 --> 01:21:20,508
我将去叫个出租车。
I'm gonna call a cab.

1221
01:21:22,184 --> 01:21:24,652
我们明天再谈，好吗？
Let's talk tomorrow, okay?

1222
01:21:29,858 --> 01:21:31,588
凯文。
Calvin.

1223
01:21:35,632 --> 01:21:38,999
好吧，走吧。
Fine. Go.

1224
01:21:42,071 --> 01:21:43,800
檫！
Fuck!

1225
01:21:45,909 --> 01:21:47,103
那是什么？
What was that?

1226
01:21:49,446 --> 01:21:51,607
你没有感觉到吗？
You didn't feel that?

1227
01:22:02,792 --> 01:22:04,555
那是什么？
What is that?

1228
01:22:04,727 --> 01:22:07,355
这他妈的是怎么回事？
What the fuck is going on?

1229
01:22:07,997 --> 01:22:09,794
凯文。
Calvin.

1230
01:22:14,370 --> 01:22:19,638
- 噢，天呐， 发生什么事情了。
- 这，看看这个。
- Oh, my God, something is happening.
- Here. Read.

1231
01:22:35,526 --> 01:22:37,187
这是什么？
What is this?

1232
01:22:38,662 --> 01:22:40,391
我的书。
My book.

1233
01:22:41,599 --> 01:22:44,500
这本我还没有完成的。
The one I haven't been working on.

1234
01:22:45,035 --> 01:22:46,730
想看看嘛？
Wanna see?

1235
01:22:51,342 --> 01:22:53,435
你在开玩笑吗？
Is this some sort of joke?

1236
01:22:53,611 --> 01:22:57,308
不，我很认真。
No. It's pretty serious.

1237
01:22:57,481 --> 01:22:59,916
你是在写我吗？
You're writing about me?

1238
01:23:00,485 --> 01:23:03,579
不，你不能写我。
这是个人隐私。
No, you can't write about me.
That's private.

1239
01:23:04,422 --> 01:23:06,982
我没有在写你。
I'm not writing about you.

1240
01:23:08,126 --> 01:23:09,923
我以前写过你。
I wrote you.

1241
01:23:10,662 --> 01:23:12,357
我创造了你。
I made you up.

1242
01:23:13,465 --> 01:23:17,424
- 什么？
- 我有一个关于一个女孩的梦。
- What?
- I had a dream about a girl.

1243
01:23:19,037 --> 01:23:21,005
因此你就把她写下来了。
So I wrote it down.

1244
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:24,070
我给她起了个名字。
I gave her a name.

1245
01:23:25,277 --> 01:23:26,835
鲁比。
Ruby.

1246
01:23:27,712 --> 01:23:32,809
我写了所有关于她的东西，
然后有一天我醒来，她...
I wrote all kinds of things about her
and then one day I woke up and she...

1247
01:23:33,451 --> 01:23:37,615
你就住进了我的房子。
You were living in my house.

1248
01:23:40,358 --> 01:23:43,088
我能让你做任何事情...
I can make you do anything...

1249
01:23:43,628 --> 01:23:46,189
因为你不是真的。
because you're not real.

1250
01:23:48,167 --> 01:23:50,226
你病了。
You're sick.

1251
01:24:04,817 --> 01:24:06,580
凯文？
Calvin?

1252
01:24:07,486 --> 01:24:09,579
听我说。
Listen to me.

1253
01:24:10,823 --> 01:24:13,986
如果这是你看待他人的方式..
If this is how you think about people...

1254
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:19,689
那么你将会有一个长久，孤独的人生。
then you are in for a long,
lonely fucked-up life.

1255
01:24:22,301 --> 01:24:24,997
你在听我说话吗？凯文？
Do you hear me? Calvin?

1256
01:24:42,189 --> 01:24:45,556
看，“鲁比在说法语。”
See. "Ruby speaks French."

1257
01:24:56,503 --> 01:24:58,494
我告诉你我能使你做任何事情。
I told you I could make you do anything.

1258
01:25:00,974 --> 01:25:02,032
我写。
I write it.

1259
01:25:05,512 --> 01:25:06,774
你做。
You do it.

1260

You're a genius. You're a genius.

You're a genius.

Rub...

1283
01:32:09,612 --> 01:32:11,239
凯文？
Calvin?

1284
01:32:17,454 --> 01:32:18,978
凯文。
Calvin.

1285
01:32:20,857 --> 01:32:22,586
你还好吗？
You okay?

1286
01:32:25,428 --> 01:32:27,396
她走了。
She's gone.

1287
01:32:30,233 --> 01:32:32,064
她走了。
She's gone.

1288
01:32:36,540 --> 01:32:38,531
没事的，兄弟。
It's okay, buddy.

1289
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:04,527
还行。
Okay.

1290
01:33:06,403 --> 01:33:08,428
没有什么帮助了。
Nothing helps.

1291
01:33:10,574 --> 01:33:14,203
- 什么时候是你最后一次写作，卡尔？
- 我写不出任何东西。
- When was the last time you wrote, Cal?
- I can't write.

1292
01:33:14,612 --> 01:33:16,546
你肯定能写。
Sure you can.

1293
01:33:16,881 --> 01:33:20,943
这就是你比那些心碎的笨蛋强的地方。
That's what you have over every other poor
schmuck out there with a broken heart.

1294
01:33:21,119 --> 01:33:22,950
你可以把它写下来。
You can write about it.

1295
01:33:23,121 --> 01:33:25,180
谁会去看呢？
And who would wanna read that?

1296
01:33:25,357 --> 01:33:27,291
很多人都会。
Lots of people.

1297
01:33:28,860 --> 01:33:30,487
为什么不看呢？
Why not?

1298
01:33:31,630 --> 01:33:33,325
你有一个相当棒的故事。
You got a pretty great story.

1299
01:33:33,498 --> 01:33:36,262
每个人都会认为我疯了。
Everyone will think I'm crazy.

1300
01:33:37,502 --> 01:33:39,197
不。
No.

1301
01:33:40,005 --> 01:33:42,235
他们都会认为这是虚构的。
They'll think it's fiction.

1302
01:34:12,905 --> 01:34:17,308
这是一个我的真实而又不可思议的爱情故事
This is the true and impossible
story of my very great love.

1303
01:34:17,476 --> 01:34:20,639
希望她不要看到这个故事，并且不要责备我...
In the hope that she will not read this
and reproach me...

1304
01:34:20,813 --> 01:34:23,281
我还留住了许多详细的细节。
I have withheld many telling details.

1305
01:34:24,717 --> 01:34:25,945
她的名字...
Her name...

1306
01:34:26,118 --> 01:34:29,576
她的生日和成长历程...
the particulars of her birth
and upbringing...

1307
01:34:29,755 --> 01:34:32,588
以及她的一些独有的伤疤和标记。
and any identifying scars
or birthmarks.

1308
01:34:34,393 --> 01:34:38,124
尽管如此，
我还是不得不为她写下这些。
All the same,
I cannot help but write this for her.

1309
01:34:38,898 --> 01:34:40,263
想告诉她：
To tell her:

1310
01:34:40,433 --> 01:34:43,960
“我对我过去写下的改变的每一个词感到抱歉”
"I'm sorry for every word
I wrote to change you."

1311
01:34:44,503 --> 01:34:47,439
我为很多的事情感到抱歉。
I'm sorry for so many things.

1312
01:34:48,942 --> 01:34:51,775
当你在的时候，我对你视而不见。
I couldn't see you when you were here.

1313
01:34:53,146 --> 01:34:57,480
“但是现在你走了，
 我却感觉你无处不在。”
"And now that you're gone,
I see you everywhere."

1314
01:35:02,623 --> 01:35:04,989
“也许读到这里，会认为它是一个魔法...”
"One may read this and think it's magic..."

1315
01:35:05,158 --> 01:35:08,457
但是爱情本身就是一种魔法。
but falling in love
is an act of magic.

1316
01:35:08,629 --> 01:35:10,654
写作也是这样。
So is writing.

1317
01:35:11,231 --> 01:35:13,597
在《麦田的守望者》里面曾经写道：
It was once said of Catcher in the Rye:

1318
01:35:13,767 --> 01:35:17,362
‘小说中的奇迹又将再一次降临
'That rare miracle of fiction
has again come to pass.

1319
01:35:18,105 --> 01:35:24,476
一个人通过笔墨，纸张和想象力被创造出来。’
A human being has been created
out of ink, paper and the imagination.'

1320
01:35:25,045 --> 01:35:27,639
我不是J.D. Salinger...
I am no J.D. Salinger...

1321
01:35:27,981 --> 01:35:30,108
但是我亲眼见证了奇迹的诞生。
but I have witnessed a rare miracle.

1322
01:35:31,986 --> 01:35:33,817
任何一个作家都能体会到...
Any writer can attest...

1323
01:35:33,988 --> 01:35:36,320
在这个最幸运和快乐的状态...
in the luckiest, happiest state...

1324
01:35:36,491 --> 01:35:40,359
这些词不是出自你，
但是又是因为你出现的。
the words are not coming from you,
but through you.

1325
01:35:41,729 --> 01:35:44,562
是她自己找到了我。
She came to me wholly herself.

1326
01:35:46,301 --> 01:35:49,862
“我只是很幸运的拥有了她。”
"I was just lucky enough to be there
to catch her."

1327
01:35:52,707 --> 01:35:54,265
谢谢。
Thank you.

1328
01:36:05,219 --> 01:36:08,655
他的想象力是不是使人叹为观止？
Doesn't his imagination
just blow you away?

1329
01:36:08,823 --> 01:36:11,257
我的意思是，他怎么想到这些灵感的？
I mean, where does he come up
with these ideas?

1330
01:36:11,426 --> 01:36:13,018
- 怎么样？
- 不错
- Right?
- Yeah.

1331
01:36:13,294 --> 01:36:15,388
- 天才。
- 我不知道。
- Genius.
- I don't know.

1332
01:36:15,898 --> 01:36:17,160
我不清楚。
I don't know.

1333
01:36:17,333 --> 01:36:18,425
- 最近怎么样？
- 发生什么了？
- How are you?
- What's up?

1334
01:36:21,437 --> 01:36:23,905
故事美极了，凯文。
It's beautiful, Calvin.

1335
01:36:24,239 --> 01:36:25,263
谢谢
Thank you.

1336
01:36:25,441 --> 01:36:29,969
我的大多数的病人都不会认真对待我布置的任务。
Most of my patients don't take
my assignments this seriously.

1337
01:36:30,145 --> 01:36:34,844
我知道你希望在我写完这本书以后。
把她当做从未发生过的。
I know you hoped that, by writing this,
I would realize that it never happened.

1338
01:36:35,017 --> 01:36:36,041
只是我想象出来了她。
That I imagined her.

1339
01:36:38,153 --> 01:36:40,280
但是问题是...
But the thing is...

1340
01:36:42,024 --> 01:36:44,822
我不需要搞清楚这些。
I don't need to make sense of this.

1341
01:36:45,861 --> 01:36:49,627
我不在乎是否需要一个合理的解释。
I don't care
if there's no good explanation.

1342
01:36:50,366 --> 01:36:52,391
我希望你能够相信我，无论什么时候。
I need you to believe me anyway.

1343
01:36:54,203 --> 01:36:56,068
仅仅尝试一下。
Just take the leap.

1344
01:36:56,739 --> 01:36:59,538
至少想象一下怎么实现它。
At least imagine how it could be true.

1345
01:37:00,009 --> 01:37:01,806
为我。
For me.

1346
01:37:02,545 --> 01:37:04,308
我会试试的。
I'll work on that.

1347
01:37:09,219 --> 01:37:11,050
走去上厕所。
Go potty.

1348
01:37:11,554 --> 01:37:13,545
去上厕所。
Go potty.

1349
01:37:15,625 --> 01:37:17,149
斯科特。斯科特。
Scotty. Scotty.

1350
01:37:19,929 --> 01:37:21,794
斯科特
Scotty.

1351
01:37:22,565 --> 01:37:24,328
斯科特
Scotty.

1352
01:37:25,001 --> 01:37:27,936
- 噢，嗨。
- 抱歉。
- Oh, hi.
- Sorry.

1353
01:37:28,104 --> 01:37:29,332
- 嗨。
- 抱歉，他是我的。
- Hi.
- Sorry, he's mine.

1354
01:37:29,506 --> 01:37:31,838
没事，他是友善。
It's fine. He's so friendly.

1355
01:37:35,812 --> 01:37:38,645
- 他的名字是什么？
- 斯科特。
- What's his name?
- Scotty.

1356
01:37:38,815 --> 01:37:41,807
斯科特。这真有趣，这...
Scotty. That's funny, that's...

1357
01:37:41,985 --> 01:37:44,682
这个狗和书里面的同名。
That's the name of the dog in this book.

1358
01:37:44,855 --> 01:37:46,083
你读了它吗？
Have you read it?

1359
01:37:49,660 --> 01:37:51,525
你喜欢吗？
Did you like it?

1360
01:37:54,331 --> 01:37:56,595
抱歉。你刚刚说了什么吗？
Sorry. Did you say something?

1361
01:37:56,767 --> 01:37:59,497
是啊，我只是问了你喜不喜欢这本书。
Yeah, I just asked if you liked it.

1362
01:37:59,670 --> 01:38:01,137
你觉得怎么样？
What do you think?

1363
01:38:01,906 --> 01:38:05,672
借我我书的朋友认为这本书有一点点自负...
My friend who lent it to me thought
it was kind of pretentious...

1364
01:38:05,843 --> 01:38:08,107
但是我真的很喜欢它。
but I really like it so far.

1365
01:38:13,317 --> 01:38:15,547
我们以前见过吗？
Have we met before?

1366
01:38:17,621 --> 01:38:19,987
我不知道。
I don't know.

1367
01:38:21,392 --> 01:38:23,883
你看起来很眼熟。
You seem really familiar.

1368
01:38:25,563 --> 01:38:28,089
也许在别的地方我们互相认识了。
Maybe we knew each other
in another life.

1369
01:38:28,266 --> 01:38:31,292
或者也许我们只是在别的咖啡厅见过。
Or maybe we just go
to the same coffee shop.

1370
01:38:32,838 --> 01:38:35,705
你在做什么
除了和你的狗散步之外？
What do you do
besides go for walks with your dog?

1371
01:38:38,910 --> 01:38:40,935
我是一个作家。
I'm a writer.

1372
01:38:41,112 --> 01:38:42,909
你写些什么？
What do you write?

1373
01:38:46,651 --> 01:38:49,518
难怪为什么你看起来这么眼熟。
So that's why you look so familiar.

1374
01:38:50,222 --> 01:38:51,621
也许。
Maybe.

1375
01:38:51,790 --> 01:38:54,350
我的朋友说你的书很自负是我看的玩笑。
I was kidding about
my friend calling it pretentious.

1376
01:38:54,526 --> 01:38:56,050
没事。
It's okay.

1377
01:39:00,031 --> 01:39:01,191
我们能重新开始吗？
Can we start over?

1378
01:39:03,768 --> 01:39:05,099
好啊。
Yes.

1379
01:39:11,810 --> 01:39:15,406
- 我可以坐下吗？
- 嗯，请。
- May I sit down?
- Oh, please.

1380
01:39:28,861 --> 01:39:31,625
别告诉我结局好吗？
Just don't tell me how it ends, okay?

1381
01:39:34,033 --> 01:39:35,660
保证。
Promise.
