1
00:05:36,818 --> 00:05:38,234
Get them out!

2
00:05:38,901 --> 00:05:40,276
All Tamils get out!

3
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:46,109
Leave me! Leave us!
No! I won't go!

4
00:06:42,609 --> 00:06:44,276
Breaking news.

5
00:06:44,359 --> 00:06:46,818
Sri Lankan president
has been assassinated.

6
00:06:47,109 --> 00:06:49,318
The killing was carried
out using a human bomb.

7
00:06:50,609 --> 00:06:53,193
According to the local police
this incident took place..

8
00:06:53,276 --> 00:06:56,943
..when he was coming out of
Colombo's Army Headquarters.

9
00:06:57,359 --> 00:07:00,818
It is being alleged that the
LTF could be behind this.

10
00:07:01,484 --> 00:07:07,193
After this incident it is possible
that peace attempts will get deferred.

11
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:09,901
And the situation there
could get tense again.

12
00:08:08,651 --> 00:08:09,693
Ruby!

13
00:08:12,026 --> 00:08:13,818
I want to say everything.

14
00:08:16,234 --> 00:08:17,526
The truth..

15
00:08:20,526 --> 00:08:21,859
I cannot carry..

16
00:08:24,234 --> 00:08:26,234
...this burden anymore.

17
00:08:26,984 --> 00:08:28,693
You've been drinking again.

18
00:08:29,068 --> 00:08:30,109
I've told you.

19
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:33,484
Whatever is bothering
you, share it.

20
00:08:33,901 --> 00:08:35,234
You will feel lighter.

21
00:08:35,818 --> 00:08:37,859
Otherwise, go home.

22
00:08:39,401 --> 00:08:40,818
Betrayal..

23
00:08:40,984 --> 00:08:41,984
Power..

24
00:08:42,984 --> 00:08:43,984
Greed..

25
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:50,276
Can I talk about such
things before your God?

26
00:08:50,818 --> 00:08:51,943
Yes, You can.

27
00:08:52,609 --> 00:08:54,234
The last witness..

28
00:08:56,359 --> 00:08:58,276
They killed him as well.

29
00:09:00,568 --> 00:09:01,901
It was a game.

30
00:09:03,651 --> 00:09:04,818
A conspiracy.

31
00:09:06,609 --> 00:09:07,734
Who are you?

32
00:09:08,568 --> 00:09:10,688
It's been three years since
you've been coming here...

33
00:09:11,943 --> 00:09:14,276
And What's this conspiracy
that you are talking of?

34
00:09:15,193 --> 00:09:17,401
What wrong did our
Prime Minister do?

35
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,484
Why did we let him die?

36
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:22,901
What?

37
00:09:24,109 --> 00:09:26,568
We could've saved
our prime minister.

38
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,359
What do you know?

39
00:09:35,484 --> 00:09:37,026
I was there, Father.

40
00:09:37,943 --> 00:09:40,776
It was the darkest phase in
the history of Sri Lanka.

41
00:09:45,109 --> 00:09:47,818
The clashes between the largest
ethic group Sinhalese..

42
00:09:48,609 --> 00:09:51,943
..and the minority Tamils..

43
00:09:52,776 --> 00:09:54,901
...had was going through
its worst crisis.

44
00:09:55,526 --> 00:09:59,484
This ethic violence claimed thousands
of Tamilian civilian lives...

45
00:10:04,068 --> 00:10:05,776
Abuses..

46
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:14,776
The supply of basic
necessities like food..

47
00:10:15,776 --> 00:10:16,776
Water..

48
00:10:17,026 --> 00:10:18,234
Everything was stopped.

49
00:10:20,276 --> 00:10:22,734
A lot of families
were destroyed.

50
00:10:30,984 --> 00:10:33,901
And thus thousands of Tamilian
youth turned rebellious..

51
00:10:34,443 --> 00:10:37,151
And joined the
LTF leader Anna.

52
00:10:37,234 --> 00:10:38,526
Long Live Eelam.

53
00:10:38,651 --> 00:10:39,901
Long Live Eelam.

54
00:10:46,234 --> 00:10:49,943
Anna refused to surrender
before the Sri Lankan forces.

55
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:53,901
And raised the demand for
a separate Tamil state.

56
00:10:54,943 --> 00:10:58,359
And thus began, the
endless killings.

57
00:11:03,901 --> 00:11:07,109
These bloodbath made many
Tamils lose their homes.

58
00:11:08,651 --> 00:11:10,734
And they sought
refuge in India.

59
00:11:13,901 --> 00:11:16,901
Indian government
expressed its concern..

60
00:11:17,734 --> 00:11:19,359
...and decided to intervene.

61
00:11:23,776 --> 00:11:26,318
Peace Accord is an important
political decision.

62
00:11:26,651 --> 00:11:28,026
I will be going ahead with it.

63
00:11:28,443 --> 00:11:30,776
We will be signing the
Peace Accord tomorrow.

64
00:11:31,193 --> 00:11:33,818
To make sure that no inhumane
activity takes place..

65
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,193
...during the Provincial
Council Elections..

66
00:11:36,526 --> 00:11:40,318
...I've decided to send a
peace force to the island.

67
00:11:40,776 --> 00:11:43,109
Prime Minister signed the
historical Peace Accord..

68
00:11:43,193 --> 00:11:44,859
...with the Sri Lankan
President today.

69
00:11:44,901 --> 00:11:47,318
He also declared the
Provincial Council Elections..

70
00:11:47,734 --> 00:11:50,214
So that once again there is peace
and normalcy in the island.

71
00:11:50,484 --> 00:11:52,734
The first group of
the peace force.. <i>'</i>

72
00:11:53,276 --> 00:11:56,568
..reached there with an intention of
making the rebels surrender arms.

73
00:11:57,818 --> 00:12:01,859
In the hope that peace
and normalcy returns.

74
00:12:02,734 --> 00:12:06,401
But Anna rejected
the Peace Accord.

75
00:12:08,859 --> 00:12:12,193
19 LTF cadres committed suicide
in Sri Lankan custody.

76
00:12:13,443 --> 00:12:15,568
And Anna blamed lndia..

77
00:12:16,151 --> 00:12:17,526
...and Sri Lanka for it.

78
00:12:18,318 --> 00:12:22,276
He said that this peace accord is
not in the favor of the Tamils.

79
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:26,901
He feared that if they
surrendered arms..

80
00:12:27,651 --> 00:12:29,859
..then once the peace
force leaves..

81
00:12:30,693 --> 00:12:33,151
..all the Tamils in the
island will be killed.

82
00:12:34,318 --> 00:12:36,859
Hence.. 'He was not
ready to negotiate.

83
00:12:36,943 --> 00:12:38,484
This is going to be a long war.

84
00:12:39,818 --> 00:12:44,068
Indian Army launched an
operation to capture Anna.

85
00:13:00,693 --> 00:13:03,818
But our soldiers got killed . 

86
00:13:04,193 --> 00:13:06,776
since Anna was already
in the know of..

87
00:13:07,026 --> 00:13:09,943
...our operational
details and intels 

88
00:13:13,609 --> 00:13:17,609
And from here on, began a
gruesome guerilla war..

89
00:13:17,901 --> 00:13:19,901
..between Anna and
the peace force.

90
00:13:47,943 --> 00:13:49,859
Our soldiers are getting killed.

91
00:13:50,109 --> 00:13:51,818
Operation details
are getting leaked.

92
00:13:51,901 --> 00:13:54,859
RD, I hope you are aware of
what your boys are up to.

93
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:58,151
But we had warned you,
not to send the forces.

94
00:13:58,651 --> 00:14:00,943
But it was your General
who assured the PM..

95
00:14:01,026 --> 00:14:03,526
...that we'll disarm
them in 72 hours.

96
00:14:04,193 --> 00:14:06,276
And here we are, after one year.

97
00:14:06,609 --> 00:14:09,776
If this continues, we're
sure to get embarrassed.

98
00:14:10,151 --> 00:14:11,631
PM needs is answerable
to the people.

99
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:15,568
Mr. Cabinet Secretary, we are not
fighting with a traditional army.

100
00:14:16,193 --> 00:14:19,568
This is a locally
entrenched guerilla force.

101
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:22,693
We just can't make out who's a
militant and who's a civilian!

102
00:14:22,901 --> 00:14:24,859
We don't even have proper maps!

103
00:14:24,984 --> 00:14:29,693
But yes, if they attack
us, we will retaliate.

104
00:14:29,776 --> 00:14:32,151
This shouldn't become
another Vietnam for us.

105
00:14:32,693 --> 00:14:34,359
How much more can we
embarrass the PM?

106
00:14:34,943 --> 00:14:35,651
RD?

107
00:14:35,734 --> 00:14:36,901
The fact is,

108
00:14:37,859 --> 00:14:39,359
Anna doesn't trust us anymore.

109
00:14:39,651 --> 00:14:42,568
And Perhaps we ourselves are responsible
for creating this situation.

110
00:14:42,734 --> 00:14:44,651
If we loosen the
grip any further..

111
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:49,109
...It will be a golden opportunity for
the west to get inside the island.

112
00:14:49,193 --> 00:14:50,984
And this is already happening.

113
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:53,401
Guruji all of a sudden
going to Singapore..

114
00:14:53,484 --> 00:14:55,693
...with Murthy for
a spiritual tour..

115
00:14:55,984 --> 00:14:57,234
Is it a coincidence?

116
00:14:57,318 --> 00:14:58,734
So, Mr. Murthy,

117
00:14:59,151 --> 00:15:01,984
...you wish to be the lord
of the largest democracy?

118
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:03,984
I've always been saying..

119
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:06,818
...that there's a conspiracy
to overthrow the government.

120
00:15:07,234 --> 00:15:08,568
One thing is clear now.

121
00:15:08,818 --> 00:15:11,276
Only military action
won't suffice.

122
00:15:11,943 --> 00:15:13,359
All these are clear cut signs.

123
00:15:13,651 --> 00:15:15,443
Overt operations
won't be enough now.

124
00:15:15,943 --> 00:15:17,901
RD, get all the
covert ops ready.

125
00:15:18,526 --> 00:15:21,734
This Peace Accord needs
to succeed, at any cost.

126
00:15:22,193 --> 00:15:23,568
That's all. Good luck.

127
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:28,151
RD..

128
00:15:28,234 --> 00:15:28,901
Stay.

129
00:15:28,943 --> 00:15:31,693
Enough of these discussions.

130
00:15:32,109 --> 00:15:33,984
Media is asking a
lot of questions.

131
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:36,151
You'll have to intervene.

132
00:15:36,318 --> 00:15:37,651
I'm ready..

133
00:15:37,943 --> 00:15:40,234
...to use all the
intelligence at my disposal.

134
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:42,068
But who are we really fighting?

135
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:43,859
You, too, need to understand.

136
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,109
The situation is very sensitive.

137
00:15:48,484 --> 00:15:50,984
Anna won't surrender arms.

138
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:52,984
He is adamant.

139
00:15:53,109 --> 00:15:56,276
And others are waiting to
jump in to win his trust.

140
00:15:56,484 --> 00:15:58,234
We will lose the island.

141
00:15:58,859 --> 00:16:01,818
And that will be a serious
national threat for us.

142
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:04,734
Now is not the time
to go by the book.

143
00:16:04,859 --> 00:16:06,984
The time to question..

144
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:09,484
...what is legitimate and
what is not, is over.

145
00:16:09,651 --> 00:16:13,401
You know very well what
needs to be done with Anna.

146
00:16:13,901 --> 00:16:15,276
Send in your best men.

147
00:16:15,651 --> 00:16:19,026
We need to form a Provincial
Council there, before Diwali.

148
00:16:21,693 --> 00:16:23,901
Swarup, get me Major Vikram.

149
00:16:23,943 --> 00:16:26,859
I want him in Delhi
in the next 24 hours.

150
00:16:27,109 --> 00:16:28,109
Urgent.

151
00:16:38,609 --> 00:16:39,776
Ruby, I need to go.

152
00:16:39,859 --> 00:16:41,318
Otherwise, you know..
Look,

153
00:16:41,984 --> 00:16:43,609
I know, I am an army wife.

154
00:16:44,776 --> 00:16:47,109
And I need to hold my
head high and all that.

155
00:16:48,943 --> 00:16:49,943
And I will.

156
00:16:50,568 --> 00:16:51,984
But it's been four years.

157
00:16:52,943 --> 00:16:54,443
And I just keep missing you.

158
00:16:56,609 --> 00:16:57,901
How do I stay normal?

159
00:17:01,359 --> 00:17:02,359
Don't worry.

160
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:04,151
Everything will be normal soon.

161
00:17:04,943 --> 00:17:07,151
Oh yes, and avoid
all these news.

162
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,984
And take care of yourself.

163
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:11,901
If you are so concerned
about me then don't go.

164
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:18,526
Six months, at least..

165
00:17:19,151 --> 00:17:21,026
Till I hold you
again, like this.

166
00:17:59,109 --> 00:18:00,026
So, what's happening?

167
00:18:00,109 --> 00:18:01,651
Bala has been informed.

168
00:18:02,234 --> 00:18:04,984
Jaffna safe house
has been activated.

169
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:06,234
Vikram..

170
00:18:07,068 --> 00:18:08,526
Still as restless as ever?

171
00:18:08,901 --> 00:18:10,109
Old habits die hard, sir.

172
00:18:10,193 --> 00:18:10,901
Relax.

173
00:18:10,943 --> 00:18:11,943
Swarup.

174
00:18:12,568 --> 00:18:13,484
Additional director.

175
00:18:13,568 --> 00:18:14,901
Of course, I remember, sir.

176
00:18:15,068 --> 00:18:17,193
I had met you briefly during
the Mizoram operation.

177
00:18:17,401 --> 00:18:18,693
Good memory.

178
00:18:18,859 --> 00:18:19,484
Sir.

179
00:18:19,568 --> 00:18:20,818
Anyway, talking about work..

180
00:18:20,901 --> 00:18:23,318
Do you know anything about
lndo-Lankan situation?

181
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:24,984
I've done my homework, sir.

182
00:18:25,693 --> 00:18:26,984
You know nothing.

183
00:18:27,068 --> 00:18:31,276
You'll be solely responsible for all
covert operations of RAW in Jaffna.

184
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:31,943
Sir.

185
00:18:31,984 --> 00:18:34,234
PM is concerned about
the situation there.

186
00:18:34,318 --> 00:18:38,776
His clear agenda is to execute
Provincial Elections successfully.

187
00:18:38,943 --> 00:18:41,818
The Small militant groups
there have surrendered.

188
00:18:41,901 --> 00:18:46,234
But The most powerful group,
the most ferocious one, LTF..

189
00:18:46,734 --> 00:18:47,943
Is still resistant.

190
00:18:47,984 --> 00:18:49,484
Do we have a strategy, sir?

191
00:18:49,651 --> 00:18:52,401
Step one: Break LTF.

192
00:18:52,484 --> 00:18:54,943
The most likely candidate
for that: Mallaya.

193
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:56,734
He's Anna's Man Friday.

194
00:18:56,818 --> 00:18:58,068
Very loyal.

195
00:18:58,318 --> 00:18:59,734
Impossible to reach.

196
00:18:59,943 --> 00:19:01,693
Step Two: Shri.

197
00:19:01,901 --> 00:19:05,901
He's the only man in the island
who can stand against Anna.

198
00:19:06,151 --> 00:19:08,026
Get him on our side.

199
00:19:08,151 --> 00:19:12,234
For official matters you'll report
to the Madras Desk Head, Bala.

200
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,484
He's tough but knows
a lot about Jaffna.

201
00:19:15,734 --> 00:19:20,151
But you'll report to me
personally, about everything.

202
00:19:20,734 --> 00:19:22,568
Keep me in the loop.
Yes, sir.

203
00:19:22,693 --> 00:19:24,359
Any questions?
No, sir.

204
00:19:24,943 --> 00:19:26,068
Welcome aboard.

205
00:19:26,234 --> 00:19:27,318
Come, Swaroop.

206
00:19:38,109 --> 00:19:39,109
Jaffna?

207
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:41,443
But isn't a civil war
going on there, Vi?

208
00:19:41,651 --> 00:19:42,734
Don't worry.

209
00:19:42,943 --> 00:19:45,026
I'm leaving behind a contact.
Swarup's.

210
00:19:45,193 --> 00:19:46,901
Call him in case
of any emergency.

211
00:19:49,943 --> 00:19:53,151
Indian Prime Minister
today has categorically..

212
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:56,068
...stated that the
peace forces..

213
00:19:56,151 --> 00:19:59,859
..will not be withdrawn until the
elections are successfully held.

214
00:20:00,193 --> 00:20:03,151
And that India won't allow
any foreign powers..

215
00:20:03,234 --> 00:20:06,401
...to interfere in her
regional matters.

216
00:20:28,318 --> 00:20:29,318
Hi.

217
00:20:30,193 --> 00:20:31,234
Vikram.

218
00:20:31,693 --> 00:20:32,818
Jaya.

219
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,359
Pleasure meeting you.

220
00:20:37,068 --> 00:20:38,401
Is this Your normal route?

221
00:20:38,484 --> 00:20:40,443
I'm writing a piece
on the refugees.

222
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:42,109
You?

223
00:20:42,193 --> 00:20:43,401
Chibber route.

224
00:20:44,318 --> 00:20:46,401
Do you still operate
out of London?

225
00:20:46,651 --> 00:20:49,193
No, here for some time now.

226
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:51,401
I've read your articles.

227
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:53,818
You are quite critical.

228
00:20:54,109 --> 00:20:56,068
Criticizing our
national policies..

229
00:20:56,776 --> 00:20:58,401
...doesn't make
me anti national.

230
00:20:59,401 --> 00:21:00,609
Not at all.

231
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,734
It's the birth right of
all you journalists.

232
00:21:03,234 --> 00:21:06,318
Whatever you print, it
becomes a bestseller.

233
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,484
You think you're more patriotic?

234
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:09,568
Of course.

235
00:21:30,276 --> 00:21:32,609
Those with passports, proceed
to the passport division.

236
00:21:33,401 --> 00:21:35,642
Those without passport, please
register at the army camp.

237
00:21:35,943 --> 00:21:37,276
Men, stay at the back.

238
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:39,818
No matter between whom
the conflict is..

239
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:42,234
No matter what the reason is..

240
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:46,318
The first casualties are
always the Innocent civilians.

241
00:21:47,568 --> 00:21:49,776
And This was happening
in Sri Lanka as well.

242
00:21:50,193 --> 00:21:53,526
There was devastation
everywhere.

243
00:22:02,151 --> 00:22:05,234
I've an authorized visa.
Sorry, ma'am.

244
00:22:05,318 --> 00:22:07,109
I'm allowed to pass through.
I'm sorry.

245
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:08,952
What are you saying? I'm here.
I'm a journalist.

246
00:22:08,965 --> 00:22:10,318
Sorry, ma'am.

247
00:22:10,568 --> 00:22:12,568
What do you mean? I
have to get through.

248
00:22:13,943 --> 00:22:15,359
Welcome to the land
of Buddha, sir.

249
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:16,943
KT. Kamal Tyagi.

250
00:22:17,234 --> 00:22:19,401
Jaffna safe house
is 118kms away.

251
00:22:26,568 --> 00:22:28,068
Passport? ID?

252
00:22:47,526 --> 00:22:49,776
How could humanity ever
survive in all of this?

253
00:22:50,193 --> 00:22:51,651
In this small island..

254
00:22:52,068 --> 00:22:54,068
Civilization was dying.

255
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:20,901
This way sir.

256
00:23:23,818 --> 00:23:25,068
This is our safe house.

257
00:23:25,776 --> 00:23:27,484
Inform the high commission.
Yes.

258
00:23:27,693 --> 00:23:29,234
Myself Sushil Pandey. SP.

259
00:23:29,318 --> 00:23:30,318
Hi, SP.

260
00:23:30,484 --> 00:23:31,693
Intercepts?
Yes, sir.

261
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:34,901
Call records for the past
two days and intercepts.

262
00:23:38,901 --> 00:23:40,443
Sir.
Hello, boys.

263
00:23:40,609 --> 00:23:42,276
Sir!
Sir, Major Vikram reporting.

264
00:23:42,568 --> 00:23:44,026
I've heard about you.

265
00:23:44,859 --> 00:23:45,859
Try this.

266
00:23:46,068 --> 00:23:47,859
A local drink.
Sir.

267
00:23:48,234 --> 00:23:49,234
LTF.

268
00:23:49,693 --> 00:23:51,818
Most dedicated and disciplined.

269
00:23:52,401 --> 00:23:56,943
They operate from deep within
the jungle, from bunkers..

270
00:23:57,151 --> 00:23:58,318
...40 feet underground.

271
00:23:58,734 --> 00:24:00,026
Hence, this map.

272
00:24:00,776 --> 00:24:02,026
Memorize it.

273
00:24:02,193 --> 00:24:03,193
Relax.

274
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:07,318
We'll be running our phase
two covert operations.

275
00:24:07,484 --> 00:24:09,651
We need to weaken
LTF's top leaders.

276
00:24:09,776 --> 00:24:11,151
Dead or alive.

277
00:24:11,568 --> 00:24:15,693
LFT. Liberations of Tamils
Front, also known as Tigers.

278
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:18,609
The top leader:
Pandyan, Intel chief.

279
00:24:18,818 --> 00:24:22,068
Mallaya, deputy leader
and army commander.

280
00:24:22,318 --> 00:24:24,776
Rajsekharan, their
spokesperson, an arms dealer.

281
00:24:24,943 --> 00:24:28,109
But our hero, Anna Baskaran.

282
00:24:28,443 --> 00:24:29,901
He doesn't need an intro.

283
00:24:30,193 --> 00:24:32,151
On the other hand, TPA.

284
00:24:32,318 --> 00:24:33,359
Chief, Shri.

285
00:24:33,443 --> 00:24:35,776
Once upon a time he
was Anna's partner.

286
00:24:35,943 --> 00:24:38,276
He's soft. Wants to
get into politics.

287
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:40,984
Prime Minister wants that
Anna should surrender arms..

288
00:24:41,068 --> 00:24:43,568
...and join the elections
before Diwali.

289
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:46,359
Make Shri powerful.

290
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:48,234
Make them fight each other.

291
00:24:48,609 --> 00:24:49,943
Do we this all by ourselves?

292
00:24:50,193 --> 00:24:51,193
Obviously.

293
00:24:51,776 --> 00:24:53,056
You are not in the army anymore.

294
00:24:53,109 --> 00:24:53,943
You are an agent of R&AW.

295
00:24:53,984 --> 00:24:57,443
Hence use less brawn
and more brains.

296
00:24:57,818 --> 00:24:59,276
You'll report everything to me.

297
00:24:59,443 --> 00:25:03,026
I'll find out what I need
to through my own means.

298
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:05,151
I cannot afford mistakes.

299
00:25:05,734 --> 00:25:06,734
Sir.

300
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:10,984
And most importantly,
you are a team leader.

301
00:25:11,401 --> 00:25:13,734
So don't get caught.
Never get caught.

302
00:25:22,568 --> 00:25:25,109
My primary task for
the next few days..

303
00:25:25,193 --> 00:25:25,943
Turn left.

304
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:27,318
..Was to find Shree.

305
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:31,359
We identified a few
important links.

306
00:25:32,068 --> 00:25:36,484
We got a breakthrough when
Narayanan agreed to meet us.

307
00:25:37,776 --> 00:25:38,776
Hello, sir.

308
00:25:38,901 --> 00:25:40,234
I got through Narayanan.

309
00:25:40,443 --> 00:25:41,776
He's agreed to meet.

310
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:43,151
<i>"Tomorrow, 7 " Imam.</i>

311
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:44,984
7kms from safe house.

312
00:25:50,568 --> 00:25:52,651
Sir, the one in white shirt.

313
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:54,818
This basket.
How much does it weigh? 30 kgs.

314
00:25:54,901 --> 00:25:56,443
And This is for?
Local market..

315
00:26:01,609 --> 00:26:03,943
70% of the earth is
covered with water.

316
00:26:04,443 --> 00:26:06,568
It's not so difficult
to catch fish.

317
00:26:06,984 --> 00:26:08,026
Oh really?

318
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:12,068
That really depends on the fish.

319
00:26:12,401 --> 00:26:15,651
The deeper you go the
better fish you catch.

320
00:26:15,734 --> 00:26:16,859
Tell me, which one do you want?

321
00:26:16,943 --> 00:26:19,109
My bosses love the fish
you catch for them.

322
00:26:19,193 --> 00:26:20,943
Which one do you want?

323
00:26:20,984 --> 00:26:24,359
I told you this one belongs
to the local market..

324
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:29,026
Tell me which one do you want?
CIA, KGB, Tigers.

325
00:26:29,193 --> 00:26:30,693
They're All the same for me.

326
00:26:30,943 --> 00:26:32,401
I don't have time to waste.

327
00:26:32,568 --> 00:26:33,818
Don't even try to negotiate.

328
00:26:33,901 --> 00:26:34,901
Shri.

329
00:26:37,068 --> 00:26:38,068
You an agent?

330
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:39,901
Everyone is the
same in a war zone.

331
00:26:40,068 --> 00:26:41,068
Maybe.

332
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:45,193
But for me, no satisfaction
means no fish.

333
00:26:48,193 --> 00:26:51,318
You see this Information
business has become too risky...

334
00:26:52,276 --> 00:26:55,401
I'll have to give information
about you if anyone enquires.

335
00:26:55,859 --> 00:26:58,026
I need to store that.

336
00:27:00,234 --> 00:27:01,401
Now you may Leave.

337
00:27:11,401 --> 00:27:12,401
SIOP

338
00:27:15,943 --> 00:27:16,943
Go.

339
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:23,693
How will you and your
government support me?

340
00:27:24,651 --> 00:27:25,818
The situation out here..

341
00:27:25,901 --> 00:27:29,401
How will people sitting
in New Delhi control it?

342
00:27:29,526 --> 00:27:32,026
New Delhi recognizes your TPA.

343
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:34,609
And our PM's agenda is
exactly to settle that.

344
00:27:34,693 --> 00:27:36,401
Election and peace.

345
00:27:36,818 --> 00:27:37,901
Peace?

346
00:27:38,609 --> 00:27:40,776
Anna has made me his archrival.

347
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:42,776
We were like brothers.

348
00:27:43,318 --> 00:27:45,026
He's being brutal to our people.

349
00:27:45,109 --> 00:27:47,151
He wants total
control over Jaffna.

350
00:27:47,318 --> 00:27:48,859
People want to see one leader.

351
00:27:48,943 --> 00:27:50,151
Come to the point.

352
00:27:51,651 --> 00:27:52,693
Sir,

353
00:27:53,651 --> 00:27:56,193
we want you to counter LTF.

354
00:28:00,609 --> 00:28:03,568
We need loads of arms
to counter Anna.

355
00:28:04,318 --> 00:28:06,109
Loads of them.

356
00:28:08,943 --> 00:28:11,859
Can your bosses
provide me with arms?

357
00:28:12,193 --> 00:28:13,318
Will they promise?

358
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,026
Can you?

359
00:28:19,193 --> 00:28:21,193
Sir, we'll support
you in this war.

360
00:28:21,568 --> 00:28:22,901
We're with you.

361
00:28:25,318 --> 00:28:27,026
Wait, Mr. Vikram.

362
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:31,818
I hate liars.

363
00:28:32,318 --> 00:28:33,984
You won't get a second chance.

364
00:28:34,068 --> 00:28:35,359
Remember that.

365
00:28:37,193 --> 00:28:38,693
You need to relax, boss.

366
00:28:38,901 --> 00:28:40,609
Shri neither trusts me, nor you.

367
00:28:40,693 --> 00:28:42,133
I'm just waiting for
the right time.

368
00:28:42,193 --> 00:28:45,526
He won't agree on anything
until he gets the arms.

369
00:28:45,609 --> 00:28:46,693
Please understand, boss.

370
00:28:46,776 --> 00:28:48,318
Who are you working for?

371
00:28:48,401 --> 00:28:49,568
For Shri? Or for me?

372
00:28:49,651 --> 00:28:51,943
Sir, I'll handle this my way.
Trust me.

373
00:28:52,109 --> 00:28:53,109
Please, sir.

374
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:55,901
Keep me informed.

375
00:29:06,818 --> 00:29:07,818
Down.. down..

376
00:29:20,568 --> 00:29:22,193
Welcome, madam. This way.

377
00:30:26,776 --> 00:30:27,901
So,

378
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:30,776
you did meet with
the Prime Minister.

379
00:30:31,026 --> 00:30:33,359
He offered you the support
what you were seeking.

380
00:30:33,568 --> 00:30:34,943
But then you backed off.

381
00:30:34,984 --> 00:30:37,151
My soldiers surrendered
their arms.

382
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,734
They were killed.

383
00:30:38,901 --> 00:30:40,276
I was backstabbed.

384
00:30:40,776 --> 00:30:42,693
I want safety for my people.

385
00:30:42,943 --> 00:30:44,943
What happens when the
peace forces leave?

386
00:30:45,193 --> 00:30:47,568
Look, it's a clear order
for the peace forces..

387
00:30:47,651 --> 00:30:49,734
...to ensure that the
elections go peacefully.

388
00:30:50,068 --> 00:30:52,526
But you're also hell bent on
boycotting these elections.

389
00:30:52,609 --> 00:30:54,151
By teaming up with Shri?

390
00:30:54,484 --> 00:30:55,568
Double standard.

391
00:30:55,901 --> 00:30:57,568
I'm already an elected leader.

392
00:30:58,026 --> 00:30:59,693
I've a legitimate army.

393
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:00,901
Attention!

394
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:03,026
So this bloodbath,
there's no end to it?

395
00:31:04,234 --> 00:31:05,276
I did not start it.

396
00:31:05,776 --> 00:31:06,776
Salute!

397
00:31:07,068 --> 00:31:09,693
Then if you don't agree for
a political solution..

398
00:31:09,776 --> 00:31:11,609
...you'll have to
find a new partner.

399
00:31:13,609 --> 00:31:15,234
Is there a new alliance?

400
00:31:16,984 --> 00:31:18,401
This is my land.

401
00:31:18,609 --> 00:31:20,734
ELAM is my final destination.

402
00:31:21,568 --> 00:31:25,443
For that if I need to
seek help from the west..

403
00:31:26,193 --> 00:31:27,484
...then I will.

404
00:31:28,193 --> 00:31:32,276
LTF's leader Anna has
once again rejected..

405
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:34,693
...lndia's offer for
peace elections.

406
00:31:34,901 --> 00:31:37,443
And has further stated that..

407
00:31:37,568 --> 00:31:40,609
...he will not hesitate to
seek help from the west.

408
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:44,276
How does New Delhi
react to this?

409
00:31:44,568 --> 00:31:47,734
How will this affect the
peace process in the island?

410
00:31:47,901 --> 00:31:50,026
Only time will tell.

411
00:31:57,234 --> 00:31:58,484
Rajsekharan,

412
00:31:58,984 --> 00:32:01,901
you source funds and
arms from outside.

413
00:32:02,151 --> 00:32:04,818
Go and meet our new
foreign friend.

414
00:32:13,734 --> 00:32:14,818
We need..

415
00:32:15,859 --> 00:32:18,026
...your help in our fight,

416
00:32:18,484 --> 00:32:19,734
in our war.

417
00:32:20,068 --> 00:32:21,859
So you need our support?

418
00:32:23,818 --> 00:32:27,193
We need to be assured of
your support in the future.

419
00:32:29,818 --> 00:32:30,739
I have to pass through.

420
00:32:30,818 --> 00:32:32,734
There could be An ambush ma'am.
Rounds are being fired inside.

421
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:33,984
I can't allow you to go in.

422
00:32:34,068 --> 00:32:35,859
Look, I've the
colonel's permission.

423
00:32:35,984 --> 00:32:37,651
I've received no such orders.
Ma'am..

424
00:32:37,734 --> 00:32:41,318
I have to pass through.
Captain. I know her.

425
00:32:43,234 --> 00:32:45,234
Not bad. Thank you.

426
00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:47,318
I read your interview.

427
00:32:48,443 --> 00:32:49,526
How's Anna?

428
00:32:49,693 --> 00:32:52,234
Hey, listen, he's not my friend.

429
00:32:52,651 --> 00:32:54,109
But I will say this.

430
00:32:54,234 --> 00:32:57,526
I've never met anyone with
so much clarity and purpose.

431
00:32:57,901 --> 00:32:58,984
You can't buy him.

432
00:33:00,401 --> 00:33:03,068
Then Anna must've also told
you about his new partner.

433
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:05,026
You're asking me?

434
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:07,943
Until last year LTF was
favored by New Delhi.

435
00:33:08,151 --> 00:33:11,609
But now, their rival TPA Shri
seems to have taken their place.

436
00:33:11,693 --> 00:33:12,984
I don't know what
you're talking about.

437
00:33:13,068 --> 00:33:15,026
Somebody has got to
be helping them.

438
00:33:15,276 --> 00:33:16,443
Why tell me?

439
00:33:16,609 --> 00:33:17,943
It's your job, isn't it?

440
00:33:24,693 --> 00:33:28,734
"The date for arms deal
was decided as 6th July."

441
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:33,318
It was important that the arms
consignment reached Shri.

442
00:33:36,276 --> 00:33:38,068
Hello. Capt. Murli.

443
00:33:38,609 --> 00:33:39,984
Delivery will be
made from Singapore.

444
00:33:40,068 --> 00:33:40,943
From here.

445
00:33:40,984 --> 00:33:43,651
By using fishing boats,
we'll make the exchange.

446
00:33:43,943 --> 00:33:45,943
And this here, is
the dropping point.

447
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,109
Point Pedro.

448
00:33:47,276 --> 00:33:49,359
Delivery at 4:00pm.
'But I didn't know that..

449
00:33:49,443 --> 00:33:53,151
This small arms deal will change
both the local politics..

450
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:56,443
..and my life forever.

451
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:02,609
Gifts are on the way
from Singapore.

452
00:34:03,943 --> 00:34:05,651
Be sure they reach
our new friends.

453
00:34:05,734 --> 00:34:06,943
Don't worry, Reed.

454
00:34:07,484 --> 00:34:10,776
My man will be there
with our new friends.

455
00:34:22,984 --> 00:34:25,943
Vikram, you will get a safe
passage from the old ship yard.

456
00:34:26,609 --> 00:34:29,859
Sri Lankan army's Capt. Ratnayake
will be waiting for you.

457
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,443
Just pay him the money.

458
00:34:31,526 --> 00:34:33,859
Landing will happen
at: Point Pedro.

459
00:34:44,068 --> 00:34:46,776
Indians are on their way.
Leave now.

460
00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:48,193
Okay. Over and out.

461
00:34:48,276 --> 00:34:49,484
Let's go. Let's go.

462
00:34:49,651 --> 00:34:50,859
Common hurry.

463
00:35:04,734 --> 00:35:05,818
Let's move.

464
00:35:12,776 --> 00:35:13,776
Move move, Fast.

465
00:35:13,901 --> 00:35:15,526
What are LTF rebels
doing here, sir?

466
00:35:15,609 --> 00:35:17,776
KT, something is wrong.
Let me check.

467
00:35:28,151 --> 00:35:29,151
KT!

468
00:35:31,484 --> 00:35:32,484
Take position.

469
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:54,568
KT!

470
00:36:11,943 --> 00:36:13,859
SP! SP, KT is hit!

471
00:36:15,443 --> 00:36:16,526
Send backup!

472
00:36:21,609 --> 00:36:23,776
Lets go, lets go.

473
00:36:30,526 --> 00:36:32,359
Get up, KT! Get up!

474
00:36:51,859 --> 00:36:53,359
Attention!

475
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,068
Anna these are rocket launchers,

476
00:36:59,026 --> 00:37:00,859
and these are AK-47 & AK-56.

477
00:37:07,193 --> 00:37:07,943
Hello?

478
00:37:08,026 --> 00:37:09,901
I'm KT's senior
calling from Jaffna.

479
00:37:12,651 --> 00:37:13,693
KT is..

480
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:17,651
Please, ma'am.

481
00:37:18,859 --> 00:37:20,276
We did all we could do.

482
00:37:29,026 --> 00:37:30,068
Sir.

483
00:37:31,318 --> 00:37:32,318
Happy?

484
00:37:32,734 --> 00:37:34,609
We lost an important man.

485
00:37:34,943 --> 00:37:36,068
Out! Get out!

486
00:37:37,693 --> 00:37:39,318
What had I asked you?

487
00:37:39,734 --> 00:37:42,443
"If you can't handle it
by yourself I can help.."

488
00:37:42,901 --> 00:37:44,234
Did I or did I not say that?

489
00:37:44,901 --> 00:37:45,901
What now?

490
00:37:46,026 --> 00:37:47,276
A marching party?

491
00:37:47,818 --> 00:37:49,234
Sir, someone double-crossed us.

492
00:37:49,318 --> 00:37:51,068
Don't give me that bullshit!

493
00:37:51,443 --> 00:37:54,484
Vikram, you know what your problem
is, you think you're too smart!

494
00:37:54,651 --> 00:37:57,109
Sir. Trust me, sir. LTF was
not supposed to be there.

495
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:58,818
I don't know from where the
random firing started.

496
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,234
Do you know what be
the result of this?

497
00:38:00,318 --> 00:38:01,943
Anna and Shri, both of
them will hunt us down.

498
00:38:02,026 --> 00:38:03,359
Hello? Sir..

499
00:38:03,943 --> 00:38:04,943
What!

500
00:38:05,068 --> 00:38:06,359
RD sir is on the line.

501
00:38:13,234 --> 00:38:14,901
Sure, sir.

502
00:38:15,151 --> 00:38:17,318
I will take control.

503
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:19,359
Yes.

504
00:38:21,193 --> 00:38:22,609
Now you get out of Jaffna.

505
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:24,401
Go straight to the
Colombo safe house.

506
00:38:24,609 --> 00:38:25,609
And stay there.

507
00:38:42,984 --> 00:38:44,526
Delhi still hasn't
altered its ways.

508
00:38:44,609 --> 00:38:46,276
The same old strategy.

509
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:49,359
It's not so. We want
to support you.

510
00:38:49,443 --> 00:38:51,943
You gave such a big arms
consignment to LTF.

511
00:38:52,026 --> 00:38:53,609
This is how you'll support us!

512
00:38:53,693 --> 00:38:55,401
There was an ambush.

513
00:38:55,734 --> 00:38:57,234
I too lost a man.

514
00:38:57,318 --> 00:39:00,234
The other guy, Vikram, he came
here and made big promises.

515
00:39:01,276 --> 00:39:03,234
Do you know why he
is still alive?

516
00:39:03,734 --> 00:39:06,026
I told my men that
he's your man.

517
00:39:06,193 --> 00:39:07,609
It was a mistake.

518
00:39:07,693 --> 00:39:10,943
Bullshit, This is how
I'll counter Anna?

519
00:39:10,984 --> 00:39:13,818
I'll handle him personally.

520
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:14,984
24 hours.

521
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:18,151
Deal with him.

522
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:21,943
If you don't then I will.

523
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:40,776
<i>He's gone to Capt. Mum's shop.</i>

524
00:39:42,401 --> 00:39:43,734
What happened at the jetty?

525
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:45,318
I don't know.

526
00:39:45,401 --> 00:39:46,776
Who informed LTF?

527
00:39:47,193 --> 00:39:48,943
I don't know. I
really don't know.

528
00:39:48,984 --> 00:39:50,859
No one knew about the arms deal.

529
00:39:50,943 --> 00:39:52,359
How did they find out about it?

530
00:39:52,443 --> 00:39:54,693
I don't know, please, sir.
For God's sake.

531
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:57,443
I don't know, sir.

532
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:05,901
Right, sir.

533
00:40:25,734 --> 00:40:27,651
Keep him alive.. don't kill him.

534
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:46,526
Jaya, the journalist's
room number please.

535
00:40:46,609 --> 00:40:47,693
403.

536
00:40:49,151 --> 00:40:50,151
Jaya.

537
00:40:52,068 --> 00:40:53,276
Jaya, it's me.

538
00:40:58,526 --> 00:40:59,651
I need to talk to you.

539
00:41:00,609 --> 00:41:01,943
Anna would get the arms.

540
00:41:02,276 --> 00:41:03,484
You knew about it, didn't you?

541
00:41:03,568 --> 00:41:05,526
Is this an official
interrogation, Mr. RAW?

542
00:41:06,276 --> 00:41:08,318
Because if it is,
my answer is no.

543
00:41:08,984 --> 00:41:10,193
How did you know?

544
00:41:10,443 --> 00:41:11,859
I need to know.

545
00:41:12,151 --> 00:41:13,151
Excuse me?

546
00:41:13,401 --> 00:41:15,026
Why are you asking me this?

547
00:41:15,109 --> 00:41:16,734
I have my networks.

548
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:18,484
That's my job.

549
00:41:19,693 --> 00:41:20,859
You should know how it works.

550
00:41:20,943 --> 00:41:21,943
Jaya, please.

551
00:41:22,109 --> 00:41:25,568
If Anna is being made more powerful
There will be repercussions.

552
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:27,609
The entire peace
process will fail.

553
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:30,374
There will be a whole new civil war.
Goddamn it. This is not a game.

554
00:41:31,026 --> 00:41:32,651
Vikram, look around.

555
00:41:32,943 --> 00:41:34,776
The peace process
has already failed.

556
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:36,943
And I'm not playing
games either.

557
00:41:36,984 --> 00:41:39,109
I'm here because there
human lives are at stake.

558
00:41:40,568 --> 00:41:41,734
Jaya, please.

559
00:41:42,901 --> 00:41:44,068
What do you know?

560
00:41:48,443 --> 00:41:52,234
Look, before I came here I
got a call from my source.

561
00:41:52,734 --> 00:41:55,234
A foreign agency guy met
with an Indian official.

562
00:41:55,443 --> 00:41:57,151
And the leak
happened in Bangkok.

563
00:42:00,568 --> 00:42:02,943
Was that Indian
official from RAW?

564
00:42:03,068 --> 00:42:04,109
I don't know.

565
00:42:04,568 --> 00:42:05,734
Look, if he was Raw
then you know..

566
00:42:05,818 --> 00:42:06,818
Let me tell you,

567
00:42:07,193 --> 00:42:10,901
they know your next move much
before you even implement it.

568
00:42:11,901 --> 00:42:13,984
So you should know
about it, not me.

569
00:42:19,234 --> 00:42:20,234
Vikram,

570
00:42:21,734 --> 00:42:23,568
this conversation
never happened.

571
00:42:39,901 --> 00:42:41,818
Assets can't call
be called back.

572
00:42:42,401 --> 00:42:43,901
Specially considering..

573
00:42:47,901 --> 00:42:49,818
Sir, there's some urgent news.

574
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,234
Please have a look at it.

575
00:42:52,734 --> 00:42:55,651
Latest news has just come in from
Sri Lanka that an Indian national..

576
00:42:56,276 --> 00:42:58,517
..Vikram Singh has been
abducted by the LTF militants..

577
00:42:58,568 --> 00:42:59,776
..in the Jaffna area.

578
00:43:01,109 --> 00:43:03,068
Stay down, stay down..

579
00:43:03,401 --> 00:43:05,651
The Indian High Commission
in Colombo has stated..

580
00:43:05,734 --> 00:43:07,359
..they are not aware of the
whereabouts of Vikram.

581
00:43:07,443 --> 00:43:10,109
This kidnapping is assumed to
be a political kidnapping.

582
00:43:10,234 --> 00:43:11,943
How unstable will
the conditions be?

583
00:43:12,026 --> 00:43:13,066
Or Will the Indian High...

584
00:43:15,776 --> 00:43:17,151
Get me Bala now.

585
00:43:17,943 --> 00:43:20,276
Ma'am, we understand this
is not easy for you.

586
00:43:20,609 --> 00:43:22,526
But this is a
political kidnapping.

587
00:43:23,151 --> 00:43:24,526
We are negotiating.

588
00:43:26,901 --> 00:43:29,318
But we can approach the Indian
High Commission, right?

589
00:43:29,651 --> 00:43:31,109
They can send in the army.

590
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,568
After all the army is
responsible, right?

591
00:43:34,276 --> 00:43:35,901
Vikram was on official duty.

592
00:43:36,609 --> 00:43:38,068
He was on official posting.

593
00:43:42,359 --> 00:43:44,693
Ma'am, we need to understand
whom we are dealing with.

594
00:43:45,026 --> 00:43:47,484
A dangerous and brutal
terrorist outfit, LTF.

595
00:43:47,568 --> 00:43:49,068
Perhaps even you
know about them.

596
00:43:58,818 --> 00:44:01,734
So you mean I should keep mum..

597
00:44:02,234 --> 00:44:04,984
...and my husband's life
hangs in the bargain. Right?

598
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:07,068
Ma'am, we understand
your emotions.

599
00:44:07,276 --> 00:44:09,526
But Vikram belongs to us.

600
00:44:09,818 --> 00:44:12,693
We will try our best and
bring him back safely.

601
00:44:16,568 --> 00:44:18,568
Hello.
What the hell is happening, Bala?

602
00:44:18,818 --> 00:44:22,193
I don't know, sir. I just
returned to Madras this morning.

603
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:26,068
Our best boy gets kidnapped
right from under your nose..

604
00:44:26,151 --> 00:44:28,068
And you're say that
you don't know!

605
00:44:28,151 --> 00:44:29,401
I understand, sir.

606
00:44:29,484 --> 00:44:32,318
You are responsible for
whatever happens there.

607
00:44:32,401 --> 00:44:34,193
I had warned Vikram.

608
00:44:34,276 --> 00:44:36,776
I told him to be careful.

609
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:44,568
And now LTF is angry..

610
00:44:44,651 --> 00:44:46,693
If LTF is responsible
then talk to them.

611
00:44:46,776 --> 00:44:48,943
Deploy the army if you have to.

612
00:44:49,151 --> 00:44:53,526
Do what you have to but we
want our boy back safely.

613
00:44:53,609 --> 00:44:56,443
Sir, I spoke to the High
Commission in Colombo.

614
00:44:56,526 --> 00:44:59,484
You know they won't negotiate.

615
00:44:59,693 --> 00:45:01,318
Fine, sir. I'll
leave right away.

616
00:45:01,484 --> 00:45:04,359
I'll leave for the army
base camp right away.

617
00:45:05,109 --> 00:45:06,943
Soldier's name: Vikram Singh.

618
00:45:06,984 --> 00:45:08,734
Suspected location: Pallai town.

619
00:45:08,901 --> 00:45:10,526
48kms east from Jaffna.

620
00:45:10,901 --> 00:45:12,109
Bravo one.

621
00:45:12,484 --> 00:45:14,193
Around 50 LTF holding up there.

622
00:45:14,443 --> 00:45:15,859
Ask LTF to leave right now..

623
00:45:16,109 --> 00:45:17,859
I have deployed the army.

624
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:24,068
Target visible.
60 degrees north.

625
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:46,901
Sir, He's alive.

626
00:45:46,943 --> 00:45:48,443
Bravo one to base camp.

627
00:45:48,526 --> 00:45:51,151
Location is empty. Repeat.
Location is empty.

628
00:45:52,484 --> 00:45:54,151
Status: Injured but alive.

629
00:46:08,859 --> 00:46:11,193
Here have this
you'll feel better.

630
00:46:12,651 --> 00:46:13,901
How do you feel?

631
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:16,443
Look at your self.

632
00:46:17,068 --> 00:46:19,859
Your New Delhi thinks
that it can sit there..

633
00:46:20,109 --> 00:46:22,609
...and manage everything
through a remote control.

634
00:46:23,068 --> 00:46:23,984
Nonsense!

635
00:46:24,068 --> 00:46:25,943
In the field, in the jungle..

636
00:46:27,193 --> 00:46:28,901
I'm in control here.

637
00:46:29,443 --> 00:46:30,901
Jaffna is my territory.

638
00:46:32,526 --> 00:46:34,318
You wouldn't have survived.
I saved you.

639
00:46:34,693 --> 00:46:35,693
What next?

640
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:38,276
Oh, your work is done.

641
00:46:38,609 --> 00:46:40,234
Your assignment's finished.

642
00:46:40,693 --> 00:46:42,109
Your cover is brown.

643
00:46:42,193 --> 00:46:44,651
You are on the hit-list
of both the camps.

644
00:46:44,984 --> 00:46:47,568
You'll put the agency in
risk if you stay here.

645
00:46:47,651 --> 00:46:49,193
So, you should leave.

646
00:46:50,109 --> 00:46:52,193
Enjoy with your wife.

647
00:46:52,276 --> 00:46:53,609
Go on a holiday.

648
00:46:54,734 --> 00:46:58,318
And one more thing, your journalist
friend she should leave too.

649
00:46:58,401 --> 00:46:59,943
It's not safe for her here.

650
00:47:10,526 --> 00:47:11,526
SP. Here.

651
00:47:12,026 --> 00:47:13,359
Will you help me?

652
00:47:13,526 --> 00:47:14,526
Yes, boss?

653
00:47:14,734 --> 00:47:19,943
Henceforth I want all the information
of Bala's movements and call records.

654
00:47:20,359 --> 00:47:21,401
Okay, boss.

655
00:47:34,193 --> 00:47:35,276
How are you?

656
00:47:36,026 --> 00:47:37,109
I'm fine.

657
00:47:38,609 --> 00:47:39,901
And your injury?

658
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:45,443
Ruby. The one whom I
always left back alone.

659
00:47:46,359 --> 00:47:48,651
She just had only
this one hope.

660
00:47:49,234 --> 00:47:51,276
That everything will be fine.

661
00:47:51,859 --> 00:47:56,276
I might have been the one at war,
but she too was fighting a battle.

662
00:47:57,026 --> 00:47:58,151
With herself.

663
00:47:58,776 --> 00:48:00,109
With her fears.

664
00:48:00,651 --> 00:48:02,734
I had the entire army with me.

665
00:48:03,443 --> 00:48:06,568
But all she had
was her belief..

666
00:48:06,818 --> 00:48:08,401
That I will come back.

667
00:48:08,609 --> 00:48:09,609
Alive.

668
00:48:28,859 --> 00:48:29,859
How are you?

669
00:48:30,818 --> 00:48:32,276
Alive, for now.

670
00:48:32,901 --> 00:48:35,359
You wouldn't have
survived this time.

671
00:48:36,026 --> 00:48:38,693
LTF was very rigid.

672
00:48:39,401 --> 00:48:40,401
And New Delhi,

673
00:48:41,193 --> 00:48:42,359
you know them well.

674
00:48:43,401 --> 00:48:45,526
Somehow we managed.

675
00:48:47,943 --> 00:48:49,401
But, sir, I got framed.

676
00:48:49,859 --> 00:48:50,943
Twice.

677
00:48:51,609 --> 00:48:52,693
Somehow survived.

678
00:48:52,859 --> 00:48:53,859
So,

679
00:48:55,068 --> 00:48:56,318
what went wrong?

680
00:48:57,193 --> 00:48:58,193
What do you think?

681
00:48:58,443 --> 00:49:00,443
Sir, I was not wrong
about the arms deal.

682
00:49:02,484 --> 00:49:03,943
There is a leak amongst us.

683
00:49:07,609 --> 00:49:08,776
So what's your plan?

684
00:49:09,943 --> 00:49:10,943
Thank you, sir.

685
00:49:11,276 --> 00:49:12,984
That I need to figure out.

686
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:16,276
But before that, I'll
get you Mallaya.

687
00:49:17,526 --> 00:49:18,901
You were right.

688
00:49:20,068 --> 00:49:23,234
To pin down Anna, we
need to crack Mallaya.

689
00:49:23,609 --> 00:49:24,818
How?

690
00:49:25,443 --> 00:49:26,984
You can't go back in the jungle.

691
00:49:27,276 --> 00:49:28,693
They'll kill you.

692
00:49:30,109 --> 00:49:31,484
Sir, with your permission,

693
00:49:33,068 --> 00:49:34,276
let me do it.

694
00:49:36,276 --> 00:49:37,526
Off the record.

695
00:49:38,651 --> 00:49:40,859
You mean no vacation?

696
00:49:48,693 --> 00:49:49,818
I want Mallaya.

697
00:49:49,943 --> 00:49:51,943
Mallaya is the most
dangerous shark.

698
00:49:52,026 --> 00:49:53,484
You're taking a big risk.

699
00:49:54,693 --> 00:49:56,568
You'll get both of us killed.

700
00:50:01,068 --> 00:50:02,318
Fine, I'll see what I can do.

701
00:50:02,651 --> 00:50:03,818
Double money.

702
00:50:06,401 --> 00:50:09,443
Mallaya was Anna's
second in command.

703
00:50:10,484 --> 00:50:12,484
Who controlled the
entire east region.

704
00:50:13,401 --> 00:50:15,609
And getting him onto our
side for the elections...

705
00:50:15,693 --> 00:50:18,818
...meant breking the lTF into 2

706
00:50:21,776 --> 00:50:22,943
I want to meet Mallaya.

707
00:50:23,026 --> 00:50:24,026
Who are you?

708
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:25,109
Where are you from?

709
00:50:25,193 --> 00:50:26,651
I'm a reporter.

710
00:50:27,151 --> 00:50:28,431
Why do you want to meet Mallaya?

711
00:50:28,443 --> 00:50:29,901
I'm reporting on the war.

712
00:51:29,026 --> 00:51:30,193
Myself Vikram, sir.

713
00:51:34,359 --> 00:51:36,818
So you..

714
00:51:38,359 --> 00:51:40,026
...want to interview me?

715
00:51:40,234 --> 00:51:41,359
Yes.

716
00:51:41,734 --> 00:51:43,651
I was waiting for you.

717
00:51:44,859 --> 00:51:45,943
You know why?

718
00:51:50,026 --> 00:51:51,818
For what purpose would
a RAW's journalist..

719
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:55,984
...out his life at
risk and come here?

720
00:51:56,526 --> 00:51:58,693
Mr. Mallaya, let me get
straight to the point.

721
00:51:59,068 --> 00:52:01,068
My senior wants to meet you.

722
00:52:01,901 --> 00:52:02,901
In Colombo.

723
00:52:03,109 --> 00:52:04,901
RD is coming to Colombo?

724
00:52:06,776 --> 00:52:08,443
You know Anna will
be very angry.

725
00:52:09,151 --> 00:52:10,943
He wants to meet you, alone.

726
00:52:19,651 --> 00:52:21,359
First you spoke about
breaking the LTF.

727
00:52:21,609 --> 00:52:23,401
Then you prepared
TPA against them.

728
00:52:23,609 --> 00:52:25,526
Now you want us to
support the LTF again?

729
00:52:25,651 --> 00:52:28,234
I think we should go ahead with
the Provincial Council Elections.

730
00:52:28,526 --> 00:52:30,401
Pick any three representatives.

731
00:52:30,651 --> 00:52:32,484
Go ahead with the
elections and end this.

732
00:52:32,818 --> 00:52:34,109
"Any" meaning?

733
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:35,609
The ones no one knows about?

734
00:52:35,901 --> 00:52:36,984
No one recognizes?

735
00:52:37,234 --> 00:52:39,068
If we want peace...

736
00:52:39,734 --> 00:52:41,901
we need the people with us.

737
00:52:42,651 --> 00:52:46,359
And we all know that
people support LTF.

738
00:52:46,526 --> 00:52:48,609
We will have to partner LTF.

739
00:52:49,026 --> 00:52:50,484
And I don't mean Anna.

740
00:52:50,609 --> 00:52:53,234
We partner LTF without Anna.

741
00:52:53,443 --> 00:52:58,068
We have been able to penetrate to
his second in command, Mallaya.

742
00:52:58,984 --> 00:53:03,151
He has enough backing of LTF
that he can stand on his own.

743
00:53:03,443 --> 00:53:05,609
As a leader.
Now who the hell is Mallaya, RD?

744
00:53:05,859 --> 00:53:06,859
Hold on.

745
00:53:07,193 --> 00:53:10,401
If we can still have
the elections then..

746
00:53:10,901 --> 00:53:13,151
...we might find a
face saving exit.

747
00:53:13,526 --> 00:53:16,818
Otherwise, in the next 48 hours
the PM will have to resign.

748
00:53:21,609 --> 00:53:22,609
Sir.

749
00:53:27,068 --> 00:53:28,068
Try.

750
00:53:32,193 --> 00:53:34,109
So... You went passed me?

751
00:53:35,526 --> 00:53:36,526
Good.

752
00:53:37,026 --> 00:53:39,401
You met Mallaya.

753
00:53:40,609 --> 00:53:41,859
How did you manage that?

754
00:53:42,151 --> 00:53:44,109
I was just following
orders, sir.

755
00:53:44,443 --> 00:53:45,943
Oh, come on!

756
00:53:46,276 --> 00:53:48,693
Don't give me that bullshit.

757
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:53,151
Conspiring with New Delhi,
that's what you are doing.

758
00:53:53,401 --> 00:53:55,776
There is a leak in my team..

759
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:58,734
You.

760
00:53:58,984 --> 00:54:01,318
We both are working for
the same government.

761
00:54:01,984 --> 00:54:03,943
You cannot keep implicating me.

762
00:54:04,443 --> 00:54:05,651
If you do that again,

763
00:54:05,984 --> 00:54:07,234
I will not hold back.

764
00:54:09,734 --> 00:54:12,568
And you know, no one
is innocent here.

765
00:54:34,818 --> 00:54:35,818
Hi, Jaya.

766
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:37,318
Hi.

767
00:54:37,693 --> 00:54:38,693
So you're leaving?

768
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:40,151
Obviously.

769
00:54:44,151 --> 00:54:45,693
They think I work for you now.

770
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:49,818
But thanks for saving my life.

771
00:54:50,234 --> 00:54:52,114
Look, I'm sorry that because of me..
Please.

772
00:54:52,651 --> 00:54:54,609
Don't drag me into
this any further.

773
00:54:55,693 --> 00:54:59,943
As a war correspondent it's important
that I'd be seen as unbiased.

774
00:55:00,401 --> 00:55:02,276
It could ruin everything
that I stand for.

775
00:55:02,526 --> 00:55:04,859
I just wanted you to know
that you are not safe here.

776
00:55:05,818 --> 00:55:07,318
Yeah, I know.

777
00:55:09,151 --> 00:55:10,318
These threats.

778
00:55:11,651 --> 00:55:13,151
Anyway, don't worry.

779
00:55:13,484 --> 00:55:15,443
I promise to remain
anti-national.

780
00:55:18,651 --> 00:55:21,359
My office numbers and my
London's personal number.

781
00:55:23,651 --> 00:55:25,818
And, Vikram, be care.

782
00:55:26,443 --> 00:55:27,443
You too.

783
00:55:58,776 --> 00:56:00,151
Please have your tea.

784
00:56:00,484 --> 00:56:02,401
I don't enjoy such things.

785
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:04,026
I stay in the jungle.

786
00:56:04,109 --> 00:56:07,151
That's why Anna
operates like a tyrant?

787
00:56:08,359 --> 00:56:10,068
He's openly into brutality.

788
00:56:10,568 --> 00:56:12,109
But it won't last for long.

789
00:56:12,443 --> 00:56:17,026
No matter where Anna is hiding in
this island, we will find him.

790
00:56:17,526 --> 00:56:19,901
And the elections will
be held peacefully.

791
00:56:20,609 --> 00:56:21,901
But what after that?

792
00:56:23,068 --> 00:56:25,901
Who will be the new leader? Have
you ever given that a thought?

793
00:56:27,026 --> 00:56:29,276
It was a mistake coming here.

794
00:56:29,651 --> 00:56:33,234
The mistake is that you
guys are addicted to war.

795
00:56:33,526 --> 00:56:36,776
Hanging cyanide capsules around
the neck of small children,

796
00:56:36,859 --> 00:56:38,276
making them into
turn militants...

797
00:56:38,859 --> 00:56:40,193
Is this your war?

798
00:56:41,318 --> 00:56:43,859
You are snatching
away their future.

799
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:48,193
The Tamilians can get
their rights back..

800
00:56:48,526 --> 00:56:51,026
...only through a
political solution.

801
00:56:52,068 --> 00:56:53,859
And you can do so, by
being their leader.

802
00:56:54,776 --> 00:56:56,068
Not through war.

803
00:56:58,026 --> 00:56:59,193
Our offer is clear.

804
00:57:02,026 --> 00:57:04,901
And what if I refuse?

805
00:57:05,859 --> 00:57:07,193
You have no option.

806
00:57:08,026 --> 00:57:09,359
Enjoy your tea.

807
00:57:12,318 --> 00:57:13,734
Vikram, phase three.

808
00:57:14,026 --> 00:57:15,318
Get Anna.
Sir.

809
00:57:15,401 --> 00:57:17,276
Mallaya will give you
Anna's location.

810
00:57:18,026 --> 00:57:19,818
Brief the army special forces.

811
00:57:19,901 --> 00:57:21,943
We want Anna at any cost.

812
00:57:22,068 --> 00:57:23,026
Right, sir.

813
00:57:23,109 --> 00:57:24,526
Mission Extract Anna.

814
00:57:24,818 --> 00:57:25,859
Two platoons.

815
00:57:26,068 --> 00:57:28,651
One will land in the east
and the other in north.

816
00:57:28,776 --> 00:57:29,776
Vikram..

817
00:57:29,901 --> 00:57:31,901
This is the position
of the LTF camp.

818
00:57:32,151 --> 00:57:33,651
500 meters in diameter.

819
00:57:33,776 --> 00:57:35,609
The whole region is
covered with landmines.

820
00:57:35,776 --> 00:57:37,651
This will be our dropping point.
Pottai lake.

821
00:57:37,859 --> 00:57:39,901
Remember, we have
only eight minutes.

822
00:57:43,401 --> 00:57:47,568
Vikram, your job in Jaffna
is over for the time being.

823
00:57:48,234 --> 00:57:50,526
Immediately station
yourself in Kerala.

824
00:57:50,943 --> 00:57:54,401
Wait for further orders.
Leave now.

825
00:58:06,401 --> 00:58:07,693
He's not here.. its empty.

826
00:58:28,526 --> 00:58:29,526
Target locked.

827
00:58:54,651 --> 00:58:56,651
Cover up! Cover up!

828
00:58:59,526 --> 00:59:00,526
Come on!

829
00:59:00,776 --> 00:59:01,984
Fast...

830
00:59:14,484 --> 00:59:17,276
Anna.. southern side.. In the bunker..
this way.

831
00:59:59,859 --> 01:00:01,109
I survived.

832
01:00:01,443 --> 01:00:03,026
I came back to India.

833
01:00:03,151 --> 01:00:06,026
But my job was
still incomplete.

834
01:00:06,693 --> 01:00:09,276
Bala. I knew he was the leak.

835
01:00:10,109 --> 01:00:12,776
But I needed concrete evidence.

836
01:00:19,568 --> 01:00:21,151
What happened, Vikram?

837
01:00:25,984 --> 01:00:27,068
Those faces,

838
01:00:28,609 --> 01:00:29,901
those killings..

839
01:00:30,984 --> 01:00:32,901
Something doesn't
seem right, Ruby.

840
01:00:34,818 --> 01:00:35,901
Just let go.

841
01:00:50,443 --> 01:00:54,859
As per the latest news received
LTF leader Anna is dead.

842
01:01:03,568 --> 01:01:06,234
The news of Anna's death
spread like wild fire.

843
01:01:06,859 --> 01:01:08,484
The whole island was in shock.

844
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:10,568
The whole world believed us.

845
01:01:11,526 --> 01:01:13,651
And we too, believed
that our job was done.

846
01:01:13,734 --> 01:01:17,359
Long live Mallaya!
Our leader Mallaya.

847
01:01:18,026 --> 01:01:21,693
Mallaya declared himself
as the new leader of LTF.

848
01:01:23,734 --> 01:01:24,734
But..

849
01:01:24,818 --> 01:01:25,943
Anna was alive.

850
01:01:39,193 --> 01:01:40,651
Why did you do this?

851
01:01:41,526 --> 01:01:43,984
No one can betray our ELAM.

852
01:01:50,859 --> 01:01:53,901
And now, it was
impossible to stop Anna.

853
01:01:59,568 --> 01:02:02,943
He became the undisputed leader
of North-East Sri Lanka.

854
01:02:03,234 --> 01:02:06,401
And now much more ferocious.

855
01:02:10,651 --> 01:02:12,943
Prime Minister has
resigned today.

856
01:02:13,276 --> 01:02:15,609
Due to an unexpected
development this morning..

857
01:02:15,693 --> 01:02:18,193
..he took this step under
political pressure.

858
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:20,943
Because of the change in
the political scenario...

859
01:02:21,651 --> 01:02:23,776
...in Delhi, PM resigned.

860
01:02:24,193 --> 01:02:26,859
A week after the new
government came into power..

861
01:02:27,818 --> 01:02:31,401
..our army was called
back from Lanka.

862
01:02:32,734 --> 01:02:34,609
This was a victory for Anna, 

863
01:02:35,526 --> 01:02:38,026
against the world's fourth
largest military force.

864
01:02:41,776 --> 01:02:44,484
From here on began the
grand conspiracy.

865
01:02:45,318 --> 01:02:47,859
The final assassination plot.

866
01:02:49,193 --> 01:02:51,901
So, is this the reason why
we lost our Prime Minister?

867
01:02:53,234 --> 01:02:58,359
Fresh elections were announced
a year after his resignation.

868
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:02,276
During the election campaign, 

869
01:03:02,526 --> 01:03:03,651
at a press conference..

870
01:03:03,734 --> 01:03:05,151
..ex-prime minister...

871
01:03:05,568 --> 01:03:07,901
..announced his political
agenda for the next elections.

872
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:09,776
Tamil 'cause be an important issue
for you this time as well?

873
01:03:09,943 --> 01:03:13,443
If we do come into power,
apart from economic growth..

874
01:03:13,776 --> 01:03:15,696
...Tamil 'cause will be an
important issue for me.

875
01:03:16,026 --> 01:03:17,234
That there is Peace
in the island.

876
01:03:17,318 --> 01:03:19,318
That the Tamilians
should get their rights.

877
01:03:19,568 --> 01:03:21,026
This is what we will aim for.

878
01:03:21,943 --> 01:03:23,026
Peace in the island.

879
01:03:23,109 --> 01:03:25,234
Tamilians should
get their rights.

880
01:03:25,734 --> 01:03:27,401
This is what we will aim for.

881
01:03:27,651 --> 01:03:32,068
My stand is clear. I want a
peaceful political solution.

882
01:03:33,859 --> 01:03:36,568
A month after this speech,

883
01:03:37,609 --> 01:03:40,734
our Madras Desk and
South-East Naval force..

884
01:03:41,276 --> 01:03:43,359
..intercepted some
coded messages.

885
01:04:03,734 --> 01:04:05,693
Reed, the meeting is fixed.

886
01:04:06,109 --> 01:04:10,734
And perhaps from here on that the
grand conspiracy began took shape.

887
01:04:20,526 --> 01:04:21,526
Guruji...

888
01:04:21,693 --> 01:04:23,901
We need to act and this
is the perfect time.

889
01:04:24,359 --> 01:04:25,526
You fix up the meeting.

890
01:05:04,943 --> 01:05:07,401
You just wait there. I'll
tell you what. Okay.

891
01:05:07,693 --> 01:05:08,693
<i>Speak! a...</i>

892
01:05:09,109 --> 01:05:10,109
What is it?

893
01:05:10,609 --> 01:05:13,193
Sir, these are the
Intercepts of last few days.

894
01:05:13,526 --> 01:05:16,734
I've collected some from
the Naval intelligence.

895
01:05:16,943 --> 01:05:18,776
Sir, since From the past few
days this the wireless chatter..

896
01:05:18,859 --> 01:05:21,739
...between London, Jaffna and Singapore
has seems to have increased, sir.

897
01:05:25,818 --> 01:05:28,276
Yes, it's okay. It's routine.
You may leave.

898
01:05:28,359 --> 01:05:30,859
No, sir. One of the speakers
voices is that of Anna's.

899
01:05:30,943 --> 01:05:35,818
Look, I'll see look into what's
important or what's not, in it.

900
01:05:36,734 --> 01:05:38,151
But doesn't this sound
seem quite serious?

901
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:39,609
Go. Leave.

902
01:05:42,234 --> 01:05:45,526
Listen, you're doing a good job.

903
01:05:46,526 --> 01:05:48,818
Keep me in the loop.

904
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:50,359
Okay, sir.

905
01:06:59,568 --> 01:07:01,068
Hello? Hello?

906
01:07:01,151 --> 01:07:02,359
Vikram's residence, sir.

907
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:12,068
The file is missing.

908
01:07:12,234 --> 01:07:13,484
Sir, spool..

909
01:07:15,901 --> 01:07:17,651
Bloody hell..

910
01:07:38,943 --> 01:07:40,401
They are both in Cochin.

911
01:07:40,818 --> 01:07:42,401
Send your men there.

912
01:07:55,818 --> 01:07:56,943
Hello?

913
01:07:58,234 --> 01:07:59,234
Hello?

914
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:36,359
Hello?

915
01:08:36,609 --> 01:08:37,693
Hello, Ruby?

916
01:08:37,943 --> 01:08:39,526
Where are you, Vikram?

917
01:08:39,776 --> 01:08:42,109
Why?
These pictures and articles..

918
01:08:43,234 --> 01:08:44,818
Something is just not right.

919
01:08:45,234 --> 01:08:46,651
Whom do you work for?

920
01:08:48,568 --> 01:08:49,859
Listen, don't worry.
I'm coming home.

921
01:08:49,943 --> 01:08:51,026
Don't open the door for anyone.

922
01:08:51,109 --> 01:08:52,109
Okay?

923
01:08:56,609 --> 01:08:57,651
Ruby!

924
01:08:59,943 --> 01:09:00,943
Ruby...

925
01:09:06,401 --> 01:09:07,734
Whom do you work for?

926
01:09:08,401 --> 01:09:09,484
We aren't safe here.

927
01:09:09,568 --> 01:09:11,776
In your absence our house is under
surveillance in your absence.

928
01:09:11,859 --> 01:09:14,026
We're shifting to Delhi.
I'm being shadowed.

929
01:09:14,109 --> 01:09:15,269
Trust me, we have to move on.

930
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:16,859
That's not the answer, Vikram.

931
01:09:17,901 --> 01:09:21,776
These pictures, these killings, these
articles, the foreign journalist..

932
01:09:21,859 --> 01:09:23,443
This is not army.

933
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:25,859
You killed civilians?

934
01:09:28,401 --> 01:09:30,193
These killings are
political killings.

935
01:09:30,693 --> 01:09:32,359
Jaya, she is a
foreign journalist.

936
01:09:32,443 --> 01:09:33,631
Trust me, this is a setup.
I can explain this..

937
01:09:33,644 --> 01:09:34,843
You jerk.

938
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:37,651
All these days, you lied to me.

939
01:09:38,693 --> 01:09:40,734
Ruby, I do covert operations.

940
01:09:41,276 --> 01:09:44,276
I monitor political and military
developments of different countries.

941
01:09:44,901 --> 01:09:47,276
This country's security
is my responsibility.

942
01:09:47,734 --> 01:09:50,151
We have been married for three years.
I know there is a responsibility.

943
01:09:50,234 --> 01:09:51,359
But there is a protocol.
But I am not a..

944
01:09:51,443 --> 01:09:53,568
I don't care about your
protocol, alright!

945
01:09:53,901 --> 01:09:55,359
I'm your wife, damn it!

946
01:09:55,901 --> 01:09:57,068
I have a right to know.

947
01:09:58,568 --> 01:09:59,568
What about me..

948
01:10:01,359 --> 01:10:02,734
How do I deal with all this?

949
01:10:04,776 --> 01:10:05,776
Sri Lanka..

950
01:10:06,818 --> 01:10:10,526
Your life was constantly
under threat there.

951
01:10:11,276 --> 01:10:15,026
Do you have any idea
how I survived?

952
01:10:16,984 --> 01:10:19,026
And today I got petrified, Vikram.
Sweetheart..

953
01:10:20,943 --> 01:10:22,068
Just leave me alone.

954
01:10:24,109 --> 01:10:25,109
Ru..

955
01:10:25,943 --> 01:10:26,943
Ruby...

956
01:10:35,068 --> 01:10:36,776
Hello?
Boss, SP.

957
01:10:37,401 --> 01:10:38,401
I'm in Cochin.

958
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:40,068
We should need to meet.
It's urgent.

959
01:10:40,151 --> 01:10:41,859
Right away?
Sorry, sir.

960
01:10:42,901 --> 01:10:44,859
I don't have much time.
We'll talk when we meet.

961
01:10:44,943 --> 01:10:46,818
At seven. Beach cafe.

962
01:10:47,026 --> 01:10:48,026
Okay.

963
01:10:48,276 --> 01:10:51,193
Ruby..
I know you have to go. Just go.

964
01:11:08,234 --> 01:11:09,234
Hello, boss.

965
01:11:11,193 --> 01:11:13,484
Something really seems to
be out of order in Madras.

966
01:11:13,901 --> 01:11:17,026
A lot of intercepts and wireless
messages are being exchanged.

967
01:11:17,359 --> 01:11:18,693
From Jaffna to London.

968
01:11:18,901 --> 01:11:20,526
Madras, Singapore.

969
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:23,026
And One of the voices is
that of speakers is Anna's.

970
01:11:31,859 --> 01:11:33,651
I've decoded some keywords.

971
01:11:34,151 --> 01:11:37,068
Like.
Foreign friend. Negotiate. Middle-east.

972
01:11:37,151 --> 01:11:38,276
Does Bala know?

973
01:11:38,359 --> 01:11:40,318
Yes, I've shared them with him.

974
01:11:40,901 --> 01:11:43,526
But he asked me not to
file or decode them.

975
01:11:48,526 --> 01:11:50,901
And His behavior has
really scared me, boss.

976
01:11:51,984 --> 01:11:54,068
I feel you are not
safe here either.

977
01:11:56,234 --> 01:11:58,068
What should I do next?

978
01:11:59,609 --> 01:12:00,651
Just stay safe.

979
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:02,526
I'll see what I can do.

980
01:12:30,943 --> 01:12:31,943
Ruby...

981
01:12:35,318 --> 01:12:36,609
Ruby! Ruby!

982
01:12:38,901 --> 01:12:39,901
Ruby!

983
01:12:42,568 --> 01:12:43,568
Ruby!

984
01:15:22,776 --> 01:15:23,776
Why her?

985
01:15:25,734 --> 01:15:26,734
Why?

986
01:15:49,943 --> 01:15:50,943
Vikram..

987
01:15:51,859 --> 01:15:52,859
I'm sorry.

988
01:15:53,734 --> 01:15:54,859
Your loss..

989
01:15:57,109 --> 01:15:58,151
What should I say?

990
01:15:58,734 --> 01:15:59,734
Tough times.

991
01:16:00,359 --> 01:16:05,693
You know my wife and my
children keep asking me:

992
01:16:06,068 --> 01:16:07,568
"Why do you do this?"

993
01:16:08,526 --> 01:16:13,318
"There's a lot of danger.
Your Life's always at risk."

994
01:16:13,901 --> 01:16:19,318
How do I explain to them that our
country is surrounded by vultures?

995
01:16:19,901 --> 01:16:21,193
We need to protect it...

996
01:16:21,318 --> 01:16:22,818
How much will they understand?

997
01:16:23,693 --> 01:16:24,973
That's why I don't say anything.

998
01:16:26,359 --> 01:16:29,901
Vikram, you need to bounce back.

999
01:16:31,443 --> 01:16:33,443
Anyway, you are not safe here.

1000
01:16:33,901 --> 01:16:35,776
I'm not safe anywhere, sir.

1001
01:16:35,984 --> 01:16:37,859
You cannot give up on
the system so soon!

1002
01:16:39,693 --> 01:16:40,693
System!

1003
01:16:41,068 --> 01:16:42,526
We Which we know it inside out!

1004
01:16:43,109 --> 01:16:44,443
I need you.

1005
01:16:45,734 --> 01:16:47,693
We've got your intercepts.

1006
01:16:48,318 --> 01:16:49,609
They are being decoded.

1007
01:16:50,943 --> 01:16:53,276
And what you've said about Bala

1008
01:16:53,776 --> 01:16:55,068
I hope you are right about Bala.

1009
01:16:55,401 --> 01:16:57,651
God forbid if you are wrong,

1010
01:16:58,234 --> 01:17:00,693
you'll be in great risk.

1011
01:17:01,193 --> 01:17:02,693
It's a big accusation.

1012
01:17:06,193 --> 01:17:09,401
I know, sir. I need
to sort this out.

1013
01:17:10,568 --> 01:17:13,401
If you don't start begin
surveillance in the next 24 hours..

1014
01:17:14,818 --> 01:17:16,484
...then I'll get the
evidence myself.

1015
01:17:18,693 --> 01:17:19,984
And I'll do it my way.

1016
01:17:28,484 --> 01:17:29,276
Sir.

1017
01:17:29,359 --> 01:17:31,026
We've got a fix on
Vasu's location.

1018
01:17:31,151 --> 01:17:33,234
He's constantly
shifting his base.

1019
01:17:33,318 --> 01:17:35,901
And But his last call was
traced to old Delhi.

1020
01:18:04,943 --> 01:18:06,484
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1021
01:18:07,318 --> 01:18:09,484
Get down! Get down!
Get down!

1022
01:18:19,026 --> 01:18:22,526
Bala recruited you for the agency
from the Jammu district jail.

1023
01:18:28,651 --> 01:18:30,609
Information was leaked
from our system.

1024
01:18:32,818 --> 01:18:35,776
They knew our
operational details.

1025
01:18:38,901 --> 01:18:40,109
What do you know?

1026
01:18:42,151 --> 01:18:43,651
You'll have to speak up, Vasu.

1027
01:18:45,318 --> 01:18:46,651
You know the consequences.

1028
01:18:48,068 --> 01:18:49,943
I just photocopied the files.

1029
01:18:50,734 --> 01:18:51,693
For whom?

1030
01:18:51,776 --> 01:18:52,901
I don't know.

1031
01:18:54,318 --> 01:18:56,651
My job was to drop them
to at the airport.

1032
01:18:58,776 --> 01:19:00,109
Bala sir's instructions.

1033
01:19:00,984 --> 01:19:02,359
And Shree's Shri's arms deal?

1034
01:19:02,693 --> 01:19:04,193
We lost a our man.

1035
01:19:04,526 --> 01:19:05,568
You were there as well.

1036
01:19:06,359 --> 01:19:07,401
Reverse the car.

1037
01:19:08,401 --> 01:19:10,026
Who informed the LTF?

1038
01:19:12,943 --> 01:19:14,151
You?
I've told you.

1039
01:19:15,609 --> 01:19:17,359
I just followed instructions.

1040
01:19:18,776 --> 01:19:20,109
What happened that night?

1041
01:19:23,443 --> 01:19:25,776
What happened on the night SP
brought the intercepts, Vasu?

1042
01:19:27,859 --> 01:19:30,318
That was the first time I saw
Bala sir getting panicked.

1043
01:19:30,984 --> 01:19:32,609
The file is missing!

1044
01:19:34,276 --> 01:19:36,443
He held me by my collar.

1045
01:19:38,234 --> 01:19:39,776
He was very nervous.

1046
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:41,276
Why?

1047
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:43,734
Don't worry. Those
intercepts are with me.

1048
01:19:43,901 --> 01:19:46,318
Your department
is moving along..

1049
01:19:48,859 --> 01:19:50,568
A few of his intercepts
were stolen.

1050
01:19:50,984 --> 01:19:52,318
He doubted suspected SP.

1051
01:19:53,276 --> 01:19:55,151
So he asked me to tail SP.

1052
01:19:56,401 --> 01:19:57,401
And?

1053
01:19:58,151 --> 01:19:59,609
He got a call from Singapore.

1054
01:19:59,901 --> 01:20:01,776
From?
Some Reed.

1055
01:20:01,984 --> 01:20:06,818
You just make sure those
intercepts do not reach anyone.

1056
01:20:06,984 --> 01:20:08,401
I've never seen him.

1057
01:20:09,318 --> 01:20:10,443
He used to call.

1058
01:20:11,234 --> 01:20:13,901
A foreign agency guy met
with an Indian official.

1059
01:20:15,609 --> 01:20:18,609
Did Bala know what did
those intercepts contain?

1060
01:20:18,693 --> 01:20:19,609
No.

1061
01:20:19,693 --> 01:20:21,609
Those intercepts
weren't decoded.

1062
01:20:24,318 --> 01:20:25,484
Where is SP now?

1063
01:20:25,609 --> 01:20:26,776
I don't know.

1064
01:20:27,818 --> 01:20:29,401
Who sent you to Delhi?

1065
01:20:30,443 --> 01:20:32,318
Bala sir asked me to...

1066
01:20:34,276 --> 01:20:37,401
...disappear from Madras safe
house after your incident.

1067
01:20:38,526 --> 01:20:40,401
And Who gave the orders...

1068
01:20:42,068 --> 01:20:43,318
...to kill me and SP?

1069
01:20:56,276 --> 01:20:57,318
Vasu..

1070
01:20:57,901 --> 01:21:01,568
While following orders from
Bala did you ever realize..

1071
01:21:02,318 --> 01:21:04,238
...that you'll be such a
disgrace for the system?

1072
01:21:06,193 --> 01:21:07,359
Such a shame.

1073
01:21:11,401 --> 01:21:13,193
Hello? Yes, you
want to speak to?

1074
01:21:13,276 --> 01:21:14,193
Jaya Sahni, please.

1075
01:21:14,276 --> 01:21:16,901
Jaya Sahni? And you're calling from?
India.

1076
01:21:17,193 --> 01:21:18,609
One moment please.

1077
01:21:20,193 --> 01:21:22,901
I understand, ma. Don't worry.
I'm fine.

1078
01:21:24,109 --> 01:21:25,109
I'll call you back.

1079
01:21:25,443 --> 01:21:26,651
Call from India.

1080
01:21:27,318 --> 01:21:29,068
Hello?
Hi, Jaya.

1081
01:21:32,401 --> 01:21:33,401
Hi.

1082
01:21:34,693 --> 01:21:35,818
How are you?

1083
01:21:36,526 --> 01:21:37,984
Jaya, I need your help.

1084
01:21:42,901 --> 01:21:44,068
I told you, Vikram.

1085
01:21:45,026 --> 01:21:46,443
I won't be able to help you.

1086
01:21:47,818 --> 01:21:49,318
I can't give you my sources.

1087
01:21:49,609 --> 01:21:51,818
All our intels
have been leaked..

1088
01:21:52,734 --> 01:21:53,984
To this guy called Reed.

1089
01:21:54,943 --> 01:21:57,776
So, it was one of your guys.
Yes.

1090
01:21:58,943 --> 01:22:00,693
And he is a national threat.

1091
01:22:02,484 --> 01:22:03,901
So what do you want from me?

1092
01:22:04,526 --> 01:22:05,943
I need evidence.

1093
01:22:07,151 --> 01:22:08,734
That's why, I need your sources.

1094
01:22:14,068 --> 01:22:15,068
Okay.

1095
01:22:15,526 --> 01:22:16,609
I'll call you back.

1096
01:22:17,234 --> 01:22:18,359
Thanks, Jaya.

1097
01:22:19,193 --> 01:22:22,484
And, Vikram, I'm really,
really sorry about your wife.

1098
01:22:24,526 --> 01:22:25,526
Thank you.

1099
01:22:31,943 --> 01:22:36,651
Reed, you your man
Bala is a risk for us.

1100
01:22:39,568 --> 01:22:42,776
His cover is blown and
he's being tracked.

1101
01:22:43,193 --> 01:22:45,318
You want me to lose him?
Yes.

1102
01:22:45,651 --> 01:22:46,651
Right.

1103
01:22:55,443 --> 01:22:57,859
Okay, Vikram. Reach Bangkok.

1104
01:22:58,734 --> 01:23:00,776
Take Taxi No. 5892.

1105
01:23:02,401 --> 01:23:05,526
He will take you to
Happyland fish market.

1106
01:23:09,151 --> 01:23:10,901
Ask for Shop No. 29.

1107
01:23:11,318 --> 01:23:12,598
My source will meet you there.

1108
01:23:13,193 --> 01:23:16,109
This way to shop no. 29
That way.

1109
01:23:31,401 --> 01:23:32,818
So you are Vikram?

1110
01:23:33,109 --> 01:23:34,734
And You need evidence?

1111
01:23:35,401 --> 01:23:36,401
Yes.

1112
01:23:36,943 --> 01:23:38,568
You are in the right direction.

1113
01:23:38,734 --> 01:23:43,401
According to my source there is a
tape and we'll get it by five.

1114
01:23:43,734 --> 01:23:45,318
Since when have you
been tracking Bala?

1115
01:23:45,526 --> 01:23:47,767
Before and after I retired a
lot of activity took place..

1116
01:23:48,151 --> 01:23:51,693
...between Madras,
Jaffna and Singapore.

1117
01:23:51,943 --> 01:23:54,318
I did some surveillance.
I reported it as well.

1118
01:23:54,693 --> 01:23:56,568
But I didn't have
concrete evidence.

1119
01:23:57,193 --> 01:24:00,026
When I found out that you're
investigating the case,

1120
01:24:00,943 --> 01:24:02,359
I agreed to meet you.

1121
01:24:02,859 --> 01:24:05,484
Vikram, you are very
close to reality.

1122
01:24:07,984 --> 01:24:09,484
Who is Reed?
I don't know.

1123
01:24:09,984 --> 01:24:11,151
It could be anyone.

1124
01:24:11,276 --> 01:24:12,901
Maybe a faceless handler.

1125
01:24:12,943 --> 01:24:14,609
Apart from there this...

1126
01:24:14,693 --> 01:24:17,533
...a lot of other activities took place
that too raise arouse suspicion.

1127
01:24:17,568 --> 01:24:18,568
Look at this.

1128
01:24:21,651 --> 01:24:23,276
Rajsekharan at Madras Café!

1129
01:24:24,109 --> 01:24:26,193
Yes. The meeting took
place in Singapore.

1130
01:24:26,943 --> 01:24:28,318
Two meetings took place there.

1131
01:24:28,776 --> 01:24:30,318
In the second meeting
Rajsekharan was introduced.

1132
01:24:30,401 --> 01:24:32,109
He was representing Anna.

1133
01:24:32,443 --> 01:24:33,943
So you need our support?

1134
01:24:35,401 --> 01:24:37,693
It means that developments of...

1135
01:24:38,193 --> 01:24:39,913
...that meeting changed
the whole politics.

1136
01:24:39,984 --> 01:24:41,609
Yes. Do you remember
the date of arms deal?

1137
01:24:41,693 --> 01:24:43,109
6th July. I was there.

1138
01:24:43,651 --> 01:24:45,318
This meeting took place
on the 2nd July.

1139
01:24:45,484 --> 01:24:47,318
Exactly four days
before the arms deal.

1140
01:24:47,859 --> 01:24:49,859
Gifts are on the way
from Singapore.

1141
01:24:50,068 --> 01:24:51,901
Be sure they reach
our new friends.

1142
01:24:52,318 --> 01:24:55,443
Don't worry, Reed. My
man will be there.

1143
01:24:55,734 --> 01:24:58,193
That's why the arms which
were meant to go to Shree..

1144
01:24:58,484 --> 01:25:01,151
...and after those
instructions, went to Anna.

1145
01:25:01,651 --> 01:25:02,651
Right.

1146
01:25:03,526 --> 01:25:06,318
Hey hurry up, common..

1147
01:25:07,443 --> 01:25:09,818
And perhaps Anna
found a new partner.

1148
01:25:10,026 --> 01:25:11,109
Who are these people?

1149
01:25:11,234 --> 01:25:14,443
Corporations, big countries,
big organizations.

1150
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:16,234
Who seek They need
economic control,

1151
01:25:16,318 --> 01:25:18,901
business deals, large
arms contracts..

1152
01:25:19,109 --> 01:25:21,693
And Their executors are
ex-agency employees.

1153
01:25:21,818 --> 01:25:23,901
They are called economic hitmen.

1154
01:25:23,943 --> 01:25:25,734
Who are these people?
Where do they meet?

1155
01:25:25,818 --> 01:25:26,818
No one knows.

1156
01:25:26,901 --> 01:25:30,151
Remember, Vikram, India is
the fastest growing market.

1157
01:25:30,568 --> 01:25:31,901
India is the future.

1158
01:25:31,984 --> 01:25:33,151
That's why an attempt
there is to...

1159
01:25:33,234 --> 01:25:34,776
...pressure pressurize her
from everywhere all corners.

1160
01:25:34,984 --> 01:25:36,984
This is the modern day warfare.

1161
01:25:37,484 --> 01:25:39,276
That's why Trincomalee dock.

1162
01:25:39,526 --> 01:25:41,734
This Lankan coastline is
so strategic for everyone.

1163
01:25:41,859 --> 01:25:44,734
Yes. And that's why they
are supporting Anna...

1164
01:25:44,943 --> 01:25:46,526
...if Anna comes to power...

1165
01:25:46,609 --> 01:25:48,359
...then they will
gain control...

1166
01:25:48,609 --> 01:25:51,609
...over entire South East
Asia via Trincomalee Dock

1167
01:25:52,026 --> 01:25:54,943
...and that would a
national threat for India.

1168
01:25:55,484 --> 01:25:58,068
That's the reason why ex-PM
is not so popular with them.

1169
01:25:58,818 --> 01:25:59,901
He doesn't want war.

1170
01:26:00,318 --> 01:26:03,026
He wants a peaceful
political solution.

1171
01:26:03,318 --> 01:26:04,484
And that's why Anna.

1172
01:26:04,568 --> 01:26:05,734
Anna is an idealist.

1173
01:26:05,943 --> 01:26:08,693
And He'll he will continue the
war till he doesn't get freedom.

1174
01:26:08,901 --> 01:26:10,734
And they will exploit this.

1175
01:26:11,901 --> 01:26:13,026
Wait here.
Okay.

1176
01:26:18,526 --> 01:26:19,776
Package please.

1177
01:26:26,484 --> 01:26:28,276
Your evidence. Let's go.

1178
01:26:47,109 --> 01:26:48,776
Nasal.
Nasal.

1179
01:26:49,068 --> 01:26:50,609
Ilpa.
Pal.

1180
01:26:56,151 --> 01:26:57,151
Ant.

1181
01:26:59,026 --> 01:27:00,068
What have we got?

1182
01:27:01,818 --> 01:27:04,734
They are possibly discussing an
assassination of a national leader.

1183
01:27:10,901 --> 01:27:13,651
Sir, the intercepts. Two
of them have been decoded.

1184
01:27:16,901 --> 01:27:18,026
Have you informed RD?

1185
01:27:18,651 --> 01:27:20,484
Not yet, sir. I was
waiting for you.

1186
01:27:30,234 --> 01:27:31,234
Bala?

1187
01:27:39,151 --> 01:27:40,609
So they trapped him.

1188
01:27:40,734 --> 01:27:41,734
Honeytrap.

1189
01:27:42,276 --> 01:27:44,234
Oldest trick of the intel world.

1190
01:27:44,984 --> 01:27:47,026
I, too, doubted Had my
doubts about him but this..

1191
01:27:47,776 --> 01:27:49,609
So they exposed Bala.

1192
01:27:50,443 --> 01:27:52,484
Perhaps Bala had become
useless for them.

1193
01:27:52,818 --> 01:27:57,776
The And they either eliminate
or expose the useless.

1194
01:27:58,026 --> 01:27:59,568
This is how our world works.

1195
01:28:07,734 --> 01:28:08,776
This better be good.

1196
01:28:08,859 --> 01:28:10,193
This is serious, sir.

1197
01:28:10,943 --> 01:28:14,609
The intercepts we got from
Vikram have been decoded.

1198
01:28:15,109 --> 01:28:16,109
You better see it.

1199
01:28:18,484 --> 01:28:19,734
Sir, that's Anna's voice.

1200
01:28:19,818 --> 01:28:21,359
It originated from his camp.

1201
01:28:22,193 --> 01:28:23,193
The words, sir.

1202
01:28:23,401 --> 01:28:25,901
Garland. Important. Leader.

1203
01:28:27,609 --> 01:28:29,318
They are going for the
ex-prime minister.

1204
01:28:30,901 --> 01:28:32,359
Get me Vikram. ASAP.

1205
01:28:32,943 --> 01:28:35,318
Sir, there's one more thing.

1206
01:28:35,734 --> 01:28:37,609
Bala's surveillance report.

1207
01:28:38,234 --> 01:28:39,401
Bank accounts.

1208
01:28:39,609 --> 01:28:42,234
Income worth thousands of
dollars from unknown accounts.

1209
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:46,068
Five fake passports. Eight
tickets to Singapore.

1210
01:28:47,859 --> 01:28:49,609
Everyone perceives the
truth differently.

1211
01:28:50,234 --> 01:28:51,994
It depends on where you
are choose to stand.

1212
01:28:52,109 --> 01:28:54,609
Remember, my friend. This
meeting never happened.

1213
01:28:58,943 --> 01:29:01,609
Bala, your tape has been
released, you must leave now..

1214
01:29:09,443 --> 01:29:10,943
Sir, I have evidence.

1215
01:29:12,318 --> 01:29:13,526
He was honey-trapped.

1216
01:29:13,609 --> 01:29:15,234
He compromised everything.

1217
01:29:16,193 --> 01:29:17,901
I believe they blackmailed him.

1218
01:29:18,151 --> 01:29:19,109
Yes, Vikram.

1219
01:29:19,193 --> 01:29:21,234
We, too, know about his
secret bank accounts..

1220
01:29:21,318 --> 01:29:23,859
...fake passports
and travel details.

1221
01:29:25,318 --> 01:29:28,068
He didn't just sell us out. He
sold out the entire country.

1222
01:29:29,484 --> 01:29:31,859
Now you let the
department handle him.

1223
01:29:32,359 --> 01:29:35,109
But you Come back
here immediately.

1224
01:29:36,068 --> 01:29:39,609
The intercepts between Jaffna
and Madras have been decoded.

1225
01:29:39,901 --> 01:29:42,318
There's There is a plot
to assassinate the ex-PM.

1226
01:29:42,568 --> 01:29:45,484
This is a serious threat
and we need to move fast.

1227
01:29:54,526 --> 01:29:56,484
You are drinking too much.

1228
01:29:56,943 --> 01:29:59,109
Are you okay?

1229
01:30:00,401 --> 01:30:01,859
You Go to sleep.

1230
01:30:02,734 --> 01:30:04,193
Don't worry about me.

1231
01:30:23,776 --> 01:30:24,776
Bala.

1232
01:30:25,734 --> 01:30:26,943
Why did you do this?

1233
01:30:28,234 --> 01:30:29,234
Why?

1234
01:30:30,151 --> 01:30:31,276
And my wife?

1235
01:30:32,026 --> 01:30:33,401
What was her fault?

1236
01:30:35,526 --> 01:30:37,359
It wasn't her fault.

1237
01:30:38,568 --> 01:30:40,026
That was a mistake.

1238
01:30:41,568 --> 01:30:42,943
You were the target,

1239
01:30:43,651 --> 01:30:45,443
but you survived.

1240
01:30:47,984 --> 01:30:49,776
You're lucky.

1241
01:30:51,901 --> 01:30:53,776
And the second arms deal?

1242
01:30:54,609 --> 01:30:55,693
My kidnapping?

1243
01:30:56,151 --> 01:30:57,443
You were behind it, Bala?

1244
01:31:19,443 --> 01:31:22,443
I have information that two
meetings took place in Singapore.

1245
01:31:23,151 --> 01:31:25,318
Where Rajsekharan
represented Anna.

1246
01:31:25,484 --> 01:31:27,318
It's obviously a
well-designed plan.

1247
01:31:28,109 --> 01:31:30,026
Here's a copy of decoded
intercepts for you.

1248
01:31:30,234 --> 01:31:31,401
We've very little time.

1249
01:31:32,234 --> 01:31:33,526
Brief your best team.

1250
01:31:34,109 --> 01:31:36,234
Find out, where is it
this going to take place,

1251
01:31:36,318 --> 01:31:37,526
who all are involved?

1252
01:31:37,609 --> 01:31:40,026
Who? How? What? When? Where?

1253
01:31:40,484 --> 01:31:42,151
I need all the information.

1254
01:31:42,526 --> 01:31:43,776
And Vikram..
Sir.

1255
01:31:44,359 --> 01:31:46,068
He is no longer the
prime minister.

1256
01:31:46,193 --> 01:31:47,484
He's out of power.

1257
01:31:47,859 --> 01:31:49,443
It won't be so easy to operate.

1258
01:31:50,068 --> 01:31:51,276
Keep that in mind.

1259
01:31:51,359 --> 01:31:53,484
We need solid evidence.

1260
01:31:56,026 --> 01:31:57,068
Okay! Guys

1261
01:31:58,693 --> 01:32:00,151
Ghosh, first code.

1262
01:32:00,526 --> 01:32:01,901
Between Jaffna and London.

1263
01:32:01,943 --> 01:32:04,109
Anna is instructing Rajsekharan.

1264
01:32:06,984 --> 01:32:08,193
It has no meaning.

1265
01:32:08,359 --> 01:32:09,318
Gibberish, right?

1266
01:32:09,401 --> 01:32:11,859
But if we reverse these words..

1267
01:32:11,901 --> 01:32:13,443
Tamil words, sir.

1268
01:32:16,234 --> 01:32:17,901
And Their English translation:

1269
01:32:18,234 --> 01:32:19,443
Tooth.

1270
01:32:19,609 --> 01:32:21,068
Ant.

1271
01:32:21,234 --> 01:32:22,484
Lizard.

1272
01:32:22,568 --> 01:32:24,026
Kangaroo.

1273
01:32:24,234 --> 01:32:28,318
First letter of each
word, TALK, talk.

1274
01:32:28,901 --> 01:32:32,026
This is how we decoded all
the intercepts and we got..

1275
01:32:32,859 --> 01:32:36,984
Talk foreign friend,
mutually beneficial deal.

1276
01:32:37,151 --> 01:32:38,193
From where was this generated?

1277
01:32:38,276 --> 01:32:40,443
Jaffna to London.
Anna and Rajsekharan.

1278
01:32:40,526 --> 01:32:41,943
Second code, quick.
Right.

1279
01:32:42,026 --> 01:32:43,526
Don't leave home.

1280
01:32:43,609 --> 01:32:46,234
We need to garland
an important prince.

1281
01:32:46,526 --> 01:32:48,109
Here, home means Madras.

1282
01:32:48,276 --> 01:32:52,734
And important prince, what we
guess, is our ex-prime minister.

1283
01:32:53,109 --> 01:32:54,693
From Jaffna to Madras.

1284
01:32:54,901 --> 01:32:56,651
In Jaffna we can hear.
Anna and Pandyan.

1285
01:32:56,901 --> 01:32:58,941
In Madras.
The call was made to a PCO in Madras.

1286
01:32:59,193 --> 01:33:00,901
We still haven't been able
to track the receiver.

1287
01:33:00,984 --> 01:33:02,234
But we're on it.

1288
01:33:02,318 --> 01:33:03,734
Activate Saba in Jaffna.

1289
01:33:03,943 --> 01:33:06,026
Rishi, you take charge of the South.
Right, sir.

1290
01:33:12,401 --> 01:33:13,693
Saba here, sir.

1291
01:33:14,484 --> 01:33:15,859
I've found an important link.

1292
01:33:16,109 --> 01:33:18,068
You sure about the link? Will
he provide us with information?

1293
01:33:18,359 --> 01:33:19,776
What if like last time...

1294
01:33:19,901 --> 01:33:21,484
No, sir. He's agreed to talk.

1295
01:33:21,734 --> 01:33:22,943
Okay. Where?

1296
01:33:23,651 --> 01:33:26,401
Sir, you'll have
to come to Jaffna.

1297
01:33:27,151 --> 01:33:28,151
Jaffna?

1298
01:33:29,401 --> 01:33:30,609
Okay. Keep him on surveillance

1299
01:33:31,068 --> 01:33:32,108
I'll be there by tomorrow.

1300
01:33:41,401 --> 01:33:43,068
His name is Selvam...

1301
01:33:43,943 --> 01:33:46,276
Go on.
He's scared, sir.

1302
01:33:46,734 --> 01:33:48,484
He hasn't left his
home since 15 days.

1303
01:33:48,776 --> 01:33:50,109
LTF is looking for him.

1304
01:33:51,484 --> 01:33:53,276
He was a part of the hit squad.

1305
01:33:53,609 --> 01:33:55,234
But he doesn't wish to die.

1306
01:33:55,943 --> 01:33:57,504
He said he doesn't
want to be a martyr.

1307
01:34:11,068 --> 01:34:13,901
Come. Sir.
You promised me you will save me.

1308
01:34:13,943 --> 01:34:14,943
Come on.

1309
01:34:18,276 --> 01:34:19,943
Speak up. What do you know?

1310
01:34:20,068 --> 01:34:22,943
I don't want to die.

1311
01:34:23,234 --> 01:34:26,026
Sir, I want to get
out of Jaffna.

1312
01:34:26,318 --> 01:34:28,151
Sir, you promised me
you will save me.

1313
01:34:28,234 --> 01:34:29,651
Listen to what he is saying.

1314
01:34:30,401 --> 01:34:33,443
What happened? Why
did you run away?

1315
01:34:34,068 --> 01:34:36,318
They said we will attack.

1316
01:34:37,068 --> 01:34:39,526
I didn't join the
movement for that.

1317
01:34:39,901 --> 01:34:40,901
Then?

1318
01:34:41,109 --> 01:34:44,901
People were selected
and trained.

1319
01:34:53,776 --> 01:34:55,234
How many?

1320
01:34:55,568 --> 01:34:59,943
Six different teams
for different cities.

1321
01:35:00,151 --> 01:35:03,068
Each team consisted
of five people.

1322
01:35:06,234 --> 01:35:07,234
Where are they?

1323
01:35:07,401 --> 01:35:08,734
I don't know.

1324
01:35:09,193 --> 01:35:10,401
They Left from the camp.

1325
01:35:26,318 --> 01:35:27,943
Did they tell you
who the target is?

1326
01:35:28,401 --> 01:35:29,443
I don't know, sir.

1327
01:35:29,526 --> 01:35:31,859
Sir!
You are lying.

1328
01:35:32,276 --> 01:35:37,568
They will kill me. You
said you would save me.

1329
01:35:37,651 --> 01:35:38,943
He says LTF will kill him.

1330
01:35:38,984 --> 01:35:41,234
Sir, save me sir..

1331
01:35:44,359 --> 01:35:45,443
How many people does
each hit squad contain?

1332
01:35:45,609 --> 01:35:49,693
Each contains 4 or 5 people.
6-7 different teams.

1333
01:35:50,276 --> 01:35:51,818
They left Jaffna a week back.

1334
01:35:52,151 --> 01:35:53,068
Where to?

1335
01:35:53,151 --> 01:35:54,401
We don't know.

1336
01:35:55,359 --> 01:35:56,443
Multiple cities.

1337
01:35:56,651 --> 01:35:58,984
But one team has definitely
landed in Tamil Nadu.

1338
01:35:59,609 --> 01:36:02,984
Okay, sir. 'He has started south
election campaign for South from today.

1339
01:36:03,234 --> 01:36:05,943
And he said that Tamil 'cause
will be his priority.

1340
01:36:06,276 --> 01:36:08,276
And he assured the people that..'
It's code red.

1341
01:36:09,109 --> 01:36:10,193
Issue high alert.

1342
01:36:10,609 --> 01:36:12,068
Ask them to seal the coastline.

1343
01:36:12,609 --> 01:36:15,234
Inform the naval intel
and the coastguards.

1344
01:36:15,818 --> 01:36:18,859
Ask them to hit any suspicious
activity in the sea.

1345
01:36:19,234 --> 01:36:20,776
Green light to tower one.

1346
01:36:20,859 --> 01:36:22,193
Confirm location.

1347
01:36:22,276 --> 01:36:24,234
Four knots enemy suspect.

1348
01:36:24,443 --> 01:36:25,734
Three fishermen boats.

1349
01:36:25,818 --> 01:36:27,359
Investigate. Over.

1350
01:36:29,276 --> 01:36:30,443
And crack down.

1351
01:36:30,526 --> 01:36:32,764
Let's go.

1352
01:36:32,777 --> 01:36:35,026
Capture every known LTF
person, sympathizer.

1353
01:36:35,193 --> 01:36:37,609
Those who have surrendered.
Everyone.

1354
01:36:37,693 --> 01:36:39,859
Get on to each damn one of them.

1355
01:36:40,318 --> 01:36:41,318
Now.

1356
01:36:47,943 --> 01:36:50,276
Today morning, in different
parts of South lndia..

1357
01:36:50,484 --> 01:36:51,484
Get them in the car.

1358
01:36:51,568 --> 01:36:54,193
Elhelocalpofice and
security agencies...

1359
01:36:54,276 --> 01:36:59,568
..took around 50 suspected
LTF rebels into custody.

1360
01:36:59,818 --> 01:37:01,609
It's believed that...

1361
01:37:01,693 --> 01:37:05,734
...the reason behind this is
the forthcoming elections.

1362
01:37:26,818 --> 01:37:28,193
Come on, backseat.
Get in!

1363
01:37:28,359 --> 01:37:30,734
Sir, did you get the photographs?
Yes.

1364
01:37:30,818 --> 01:37:33,068
He's This is Kanda.
LTF's sympathizers.

1365
01:37:33,151 --> 01:37:36,401
He's He is the one who received
Anna's second code from Jaffna.

1366
01:37:37,401 --> 01:37:38,651
But He's missing as of now.

1367
01:37:38,734 --> 01:37:39,484
And about the other one?

1368
01:37:39,568 --> 01:37:41,484
The one in on the
right is Kanankanan.

1369
01:37:41,734 --> 01:37:43,984
We caught him during the crackdown.
He's in Madurai jail.

1370
01:37:44,109 --> 01:37:45,818
We can get some
information from him.

1371
01:38:08,484 --> 01:38:09,734
When did you come to India?

1372
01:38:10,734 --> 01:38:12,151
Six months back.

1373
01:38:12,609 --> 01:38:13,776
He's Kanda.

1374
01:38:13,943 --> 01:38:15,234
How do you know him?

1375
01:38:15,526 --> 01:38:19,026
Sir, He's he is LTF's
local contact here.

1376
01:38:19,734 --> 01:38:21,609
He provides legal
help to refugees.

1377
01:38:22,443 --> 01:38:24,359
Passport, ration card.

1378
01:38:25,109 --> 01:38:26,443
He gave helped me one too.

1379
01:38:26,943 --> 01:38:28,423
I've been working
for him since then.

1380
01:38:28,609 --> 01:38:29,818
Where is Kanda now?

1381
01:38:29,943 --> 01:38:31,983
I don't know, sir. Since
I'm I have been in prison.

1382
01:38:32,068 --> 01:38:33,943
Lying?
No, sir.

1383
01:38:34,401 --> 01:38:36,484
One of LTF's seniors
came here some time ago.

1384
01:38:36,651 --> 01:38:38,359
Yes, Rajsekharan.

1385
01:38:38,859 --> 01:38:40,609
He came by a boat? From Jaffna?

1386
01:38:40,693 --> 01:38:44,234
No, sir. I and Kanda sir and I
picked him up from the airport.

1387
01:38:44,609 --> 01:38:45,901
Where was he coming from?

1388
01:38:46,234 --> 01:38:47,359
London.

1389
01:38:47,609 --> 01:38:48,859
Then what happened?

1390
01:38:50,776 --> 01:38:52,276
I'll set you up here for
the lifetime make...

1391
01:38:52,359 --> 01:38:54,109
...this your permanent residence.
Got it?

1392
01:38:57,984 --> 01:39:02,484
After he came here they had a
discussion at the farmhouse.

1393
01:39:02,943 --> 01:39:04,463
A discussion about
some assassination.

1394
01:39:04,484 --> 01:39:05,818
Whose assassination?

1395
01:39:05,943 --> 01:39:07,109
I don't know.

1396
01:39:07,276 --> 01:39:10,443
But Rajsekharan was
very angry that night.

1397
01:39:10,609 --> 01:39:13,651
Kanda sir asked me
to leave after that.

1398
01:39:18,151 --> 01:39:22,151
Then you know about the LTF groups
that came here a few days ago.

1399
01:39:22,984 --> 01:39:24,068
What do you know about it?

1400
01:39:24,193 --> 01:39:27,443
I was instructed to
pick up the refugees.

1401
01:39:40,109 --> 01:39:42,359
I thought they are
regular refugees.

1402
01:39:42,609 --> 01:39:46,776
But this time Kanda sir
personally received them.

1403
01:39:59,026 --> 01:40:00,484
Do you know them?

1404
01:40:00,943 --> 01:40:02,484
They weren't refugees.

1405
01:40:02,609 --> 01:40:04,484
They looked different.

1406
01:40:04,734 --> 01:40:06,026
Where did you drop them?

1407
01:40:06,818 --> 01:40:07,859
Beach road.

1408
01:40:08,484 --> 01:40:09,776
House No. 33.

1409
01:40:09,943 --> 01:40:10,984
Where are they now?

1410
01:40:11,151 --> 01:40:12,401
I don't know.

1411
01:40:16,901 --> 01:40:18,109
Hello, Vikram? It's Jaya.

1412
01:40:18,359 --> 01:40:21,109
Rajsekharan was
traced in London.

1413
01:40:21,609 --> 01:40:24,359
He holds four to five passports
under different names.

1414
01:40:24,776 --> 01:40:27,818
So in London, he did have a
crucial meeting in Madras café.

1415
01:40:28,151 --> 01:40:30,943
And there were others with him.
Who all?

1416
01:40:31,068 --> 01:40:32,151
No idea.

1417
01:40:32,276 --> 01:40:34,318
But I actually called
for something else.

1418
01:40:34,401 --> 01:40:37,609
It's really, really important
and you need to know this.

1419
01:40:37,859 --> 01:40:39,693
But I can't tell you
over the phone.

1420
01:40:39,776 --> 01:40:41,109
Fax?
No.

1421
01:40:41,193 --> 01:40:42,901
I need to see you in person.

1422
01:40:42,943 --> 01:40:45,151
I'm coming to New
Delhi, day after.

1423
01:40:45,234 --> 01:40:46,651
We'll meet day after tomorrow.

1424
01:40:46,734 --> 01:40:48,484
Hotel Imperial, at 9:00pm.

1425
01:41:19,734 --> 01:41:21,134
Good evening, sir.
Good evening.

1426
01:41:21,151 --> 01:41:22,943
A few people came
here some days ago.

1427
01:41:23,109 --> 01:41:24,859
How many?
2-3 people.

1428
01:41:24,943 --> 01:41:26,943
They bought a lot of
industrial chemicals.

1429
01:41:26,984 --> 01:41:28,859
Something normal people
usually don't buy.

1430
01:41:28,984 --> 01:41:30,901
From where had they come?
I don't know.

1431
01:41:31,109 --> 01:41:32,318
But they weren't locals.

1432
01:41:32,734 --> 01:41:34,526
Let me know if you
find anything else.

1433
01:41:34,818 --> 01:41:36,109
Okay, sir.

1434
01:41:37,276 --> 01:41:40,443
Exile Rama coming home,
lets celebrate Deepavali.

1435
01:41:40,526 --> 01:41:41,943
Sorry, sir, for
calling this late.

1436
01:41:42,026 --> 01:41:43,943
But we've intercepted
another wireless.

1437
01:41:44,026 --> 01:41:45,568
Between Jaffna and Madras.

1438
01:41:45,734 --> 01:41:46,734
What is it?

1439
01:41:47,068 --> 01:41:48,609
Sir, it goes
something like this.

1440
01:41:48,693 --> 01:41:50,443
Celebrate Diwali Ex-PM..

1441
01:41:50,609 --> 01:41:52,026
Diwali.. Ex-PM..

1442
01:41:52,734 --> 01:41:53,984
EX-PM..

1443
01:41:54,776 --> 01:41:56,337
Anything unusual?
I don't know, sir.

1444
01:41:56,401 --> 01:41:59,109
Perhaps they are
reconfirming the target.

1445
01:41:59,193 --> 01:42:01,234
Okay. Find out. Keep me informed.
Right, sir.

1446
01:42:01,526 --> 01:42:03,484
When do you think we
can have the delivery.

1447
01:42:03,901 --> 01:42:05,818
My contact will get
in touch with you.

1448
01:42:06,026 --> 01:42:08,276
What did you find, Arjun?
Sir, check this.

1449
01:42:09,901 --> 01:42:12,234
Whose call is it?
Vijayan. Vijayan Joseph.

1450
01:42:15,776 --> 01:42:17,401
Hello, sir.
Yes, Rishi?

1451
01:42:17,984 --> 01:42:19,568
Sir, we've traced
Vijayan's call.

1452
01:42:19,776 --> 01:42:21,443
From where?
What's the source?

1453
01:42:21,609 --> 01:42:22,818
Street one. Maduria. Mylapore.

1454
01:42:22,984 --> 01:42:24,068
MWapore.

1455
01:42:24,151 --> 01:42:25,401
Connect to Delhi.
Yeah.

1456
01:42:25,568 --> 01:42:27,234
Connect Madras.
Right, sir.

1457
01:42:28,651 --> 01:42:29,651
Delhi connected, sir.

1458
01:42:29,734 --> 01:42:30,776
Sir, Delhi connected.

1459
01:42:30,859 --> 01:42:31,526
Give me the details.

1460
01:42:31,609 --> 01:42:32,776
Sir, Madras connected.

1461
01:42:32,859 --> 01:42:34,109
Sir, picking up and delivery.

1462
01:42:34,193 --> 01:42:35,873
Sir, they are talking
about some delivery.

1463
01:42:35,901 --> 01:42:37,421
Call has been traced to?
Jaffna, sir.

1464
01:42:37,443 --> 01:42:38,776
Call has been traced
to Jaffna, sir.

1465
01:42:38,859 --> 01:42:40,818
Sir, Vijayan is the one
who came from Germany.

1466
01:42:40,901 --> 01:42:42,318
He's a bombmaker.

1467
01:42:44,359 --> 01:42:45,776
Number tracked, sir.

1468
01:42:46,568 --> 01:42:48,409
Fine. I'll be there by tomorrow.
Okay, sir.

1469
01:43:09,818 --> 01:43:12,943
That's Rajsekharan, at
Madras Café, London.

1470
01:43:15,109 --> 01:43:16,193
Look at this.

1471
01:43:16,651 --> 01:43:18,734
I couldn't share this
with you over the phone.

1472
01:43:20,859 --> 01:43:22,276
I don't think there's much time.

1473
01:43:23,776 --> 01:43:27,234
Four days back, this amount was
transferred into the LTF account.

1474
01:43:27,609 --> 01:43:29,651
This means this is the
final confirmation?

1475
01:43:30,068 --> 01:43:31,151
For any job,

1476
01:43:32,026 --> 01:43:33,776
money is the final confirmation.

1477
01:43:33,984 --> 01:43:35,318
Where did you get this from?

1478
01:43:35,943 --> 01:43:37,609
I was investigating these banks.

1479
01:43:37,818 --> 01:43:41,318
And realized such banks
only exist on paper.

1480
01:43:41,776 --> 01:43:45,068
They remain for a few
days, months and then,

1481
01:43:45,526 --> 01:43:46,943
they just disappear.

1482
01:43:47,443 --> 01:43:49,859
So, first the speech
by the ex-PM.

1483
01:43:51,318 --> 01:43:53,901
Then Rajsekharan goes
to Madras Café, London.

1484
01:43:54,943 --> 01:43:56,651
And that's where possibly
things happened.

1485
01:43:57,276 --> 01:43:59,734
Anna, he's coming
back to power.

1486
01:44:00,818 --> 01:44:02,859
He will not let us
do what we want.

1487
01:44:03,526 --> 01:44:05,151
He'll demand a
political solution.

1488
01:44:05,359 --> 01:44:06,776
Now we will only have to act.

1489
01:44:08,026 --> 01:44:09,776
Does anyone else know
that you are here?

1490
01:44:11,609 --> 01:44:12,609
No.

1491
01:44:18,818 --> 01:44:21,526
Abuda.
Does the jacket fit well?

1492
01:44:21,901 --> 01:44:22,822
Hope its not too tight?

1493
01:44:22,901 --> 01:44:24,068
No, its fine.

1494
01:44:24,276 --> 01:44:25,318
Okay. Okay.

1495
01:44:25,526 --> 01:44:27,484
Then we'll do the
rehearsal tonight.

1496
01:44:27,734 --> 01:44:28,901
Okay?
Okay.

1497
01:44:39,109 --> 01:44:40,276
Okay, Jaya.

1498
01:44:41,609 --> 01:44:44,151
So, what'll you do now, Vikram?

1499
01:44:44,651 --> 01:44:45,818
I don't know.

1500
01:44:46,859 --> 01:44:48,151
Be careful, Vikram.

1501
01:44:48,818 --> 01:44:51,193
Please proceed to Gate No. 3.

1502
01:44:51,276 --> 01:44:53,693
Security check begins
in ten minutes.

1503
01:44:55,193 --> 01:44:57,609
This is the final boarding
call for passengers of...

1504
01:44:57,734 --> 01:45:00,401
Flight No. 3728 to Kansas City.

1505
01:45:00,609 --> 01:45:02,943
Please proceed to Gate No.
3 immediately.

1506
01:45:03,026 --> 01:45:05,401
Security check will
begin in a while.

1507
01:45:35,318 --> 01:45:36,901
Hands up! Don't move.

1508
01:45:38,568 --> 01:45:39,943
Catch him!

1509
01:45:44,109 --> 01:45:46,359
Hands up! Don't move!
Stay : Stay down.

1510
01:45:46,443 --> 01:45:47,734
Sir, please!
Relax!

1511
01:45:47,818 --> 01:45:49,734
Sir, I'm not involved.

1512
01:45:54,734 --> 01:45:56,214
Go and check everywhere.
Yes, sir.

1513
01:45:56,234 --> 01:45:57,443
Check outside.
Come on.

1514
01:45:57,526 --> 01:45:58,901
Go!
Come on!

1515
01:46:02,276 --> 01:46:03,526
What were you thinking?

1516
01:46:03,943 --> 01:46:07,359
You'll make bombs here and your
family will stay safe in Germany?

1517
01:46:08,609 --> 01:46:10,401
This is your wife and
daughter, right?

1518
01:46:11,734 --> 01:46:13,109
Do you wish to see them alive?

1519
01:46:13,359 --> 01:46:16,026
Please, sir, do them no harm.

1520
01:46:16,568 --> 01:46:18,193
They are innocent.

1521
01:46:18,401 --> 01:46:20,068
What about the people
who live here?

1522
01:46:21,151 --> 01:46:22,234
What about them?

1523
01:46:22,484 --> 01:46:24,151
Whom did you supply
the explosives to?

1524
01:46:24,526 --> 01:46:26,859
I was hired.

1525
01:46:27,443 --> 01:46:29,568
I was told I'll be
paid well, sir.

1526
01:46:29,943 --> 01:46:31,193
I'm not a terrorist, sir.

1527
01:46:31,484 --> 01:46:32,943
I'm a chemical engineer.

1528
01:46:33,401 --> 01:46:35,443
I used to work in Germany.

1529
01:46:35,943 --> 01:46:38,984
I tested the
explosives in Germany.

1530
01:46:40,651 --> 01:46:42,526
I came to India
three months ago.

1531
01:46:42,901 --> 01:46:45,151
They supplied me with
the raw materials.

1532
01:46:45,484 --> 01:46:47,651
I just assembled it.
That's all, sir.

1533
01:46:47,818 --> 01:46:49,068
What did you assemble?

1534
01:46:50,901 --> 01:46:52,234
Plastic explosives.

1535
01:46:53,318 --> 01:46:54,901
First time in the world.

1536
01:46:55,276 --> 01:46:56,734
High quality explosives.

1537
01:46:57,234 --> 01:46:58,901
Rubber like material.

1538
01:46:59,026 --> 01:47:03,943
Advantage is that the metal
detectives can't detect it.

1539
01:47:16,984 --> 01:47:22,526
And kills it can kill everyone
anyone in the radius of 20-30 feet.

1540
01:47:23,401 --> 01:47:25,151
Where are they taking it?

1541
01:47:25,693 --> 01:47:27,734
How will they use it?
I don't know, sir.

1542
01:47:28,443 --> 01:47:30,234
It can happen anywhere

1543
01:47:30,568 --> 01:47:34,609
Delhi, Bombay, Madras. Anywhere.

1544
01:47:34,901 --> 01:47:35,984
When will they hit?

1545
01:47:36,318 --> 01:47:37,401
I don't know, sir.

1546
01:47:37,943 --> 01:47:39,484
While we are speaking, sir..

1547
01:47:44,651 --> 01:47:46,984
Can it be deactivated from here?
Somehow..

1548
01:47:47,526 --> 01:47:49,109
All the bombs? No. Not possible.

1549
01:47:49,984 --> 01:47:51,651
But my family, sir..

1550
01:48:17,484 --> 01:48:19,859
Ghosh, the third intercept?
Deepti?

1551
01:48:19,943 --> 01:48:22,651
Celebrate Diwali, Exile
Rama, coming home.

1552
01:48:22,943 --> 01:48:24,609
Get ex-PM's rally schedule.
Quick.

1553
01:48:24,818 --> 01:48:26,068
Right here, sir.

1554
01:48:39,943 --> 01:48:41,068
Excuse me, sir.

1555
01:48:41,443 --> 01:48:43,123
There's a technical
problem in the flight.

1556
01:48:43,151 --> 01:48:44,276
It'll take a bit longer.

1557
01:48:44,359 --> 01:48:46,526
How long?
About an hour.

1558
01:48:46,818 --> 01:48:47,818
Okay.

1559
01:48:48,734 --> 01:48:52,026
Sir, this last intercept is
between Jaffna and Madras.

1560
01:48:52,443 --> 01:48:56,193
Celebrate Diwali, Exile
Rama, coming home.

1561
01:48:56,609 --> 01:48:58,443
Sir, it has been decoded.

1562
01:48:58,984 --> 01:49:00,484
Exile.
Ex.

1563
01:49:00,651 --> 01:49:02,026
Rama... PM.

1564
01:49:02,193 --> 01:49:03,234
EX-PM.

1565
01:49:03,609 --> 01:49:06,484
His today's rally schedule.

1566
01:49:06,859 --> 01:49:08,068
10am.
Warrangal.

1567
01:49:08,234 --> 01:49:09,901
1:30pm. Vijaywada.

1568
01:49:10,151 --> 01:49:11,484
4:00pm. Hyderabad.

1569
01:49:11,651 --> 01:49:14,068
And 10:00pm Poothiyaddur.

1570
01:49:19,068 --> 01:49:21,734
What I want to say is, ex-PM.

1571
01:49:22,026 --> 01:49:26,234
X in roman is ten.

1572
01:49:26,984 --> 01:49:28,693
10:00pm.

1573
01:49:29,359 --> 01:49:31,818
Ex-PM. 10:00pm.

1574
01:49:32,609 --> 01:49:34,443
Poothiyaddur, 10:00pm.

1575
01:49:34,651 --> 01:49:38,151
You mean they are
striking tonight?

1576
01:49:38,568 --> 01:49:39,526
I think so, sir.

1577
01:49:39,609 --> 01:49:42,401
Where is he right now?
Hyderabad airport lounge, sir.

1578
01:50:04,526 --> 01:50:05,526
Oh God!

1579
01:50:06,776 --> 01:50:08,109
We can't take a chance.

1580
01:50:08,401 --> 01:50:09,818
We're already late.

1581
01:50:16,109 --> 01:50:17,651
We'll have to stop him.
Sir.

1582
01:50:17,943 --> 01:50:20,359
Get me Hyderabad airport.
Sir.

1583
01:50:32,151 --> 01:50:37,401
All our intels are clearing stating
that LTF will target the ex-PM.

1584
01:50:37,776 --> 01:50:39,193
We've strong evidence.

1585
01:50:39,276 --> 01:50:41,651
First back switch,
then front switch.

1586
01:50:45,984 --> 01:50:47,776
First back switch,

1587
01:50:48,526 --> 01:50:49,943
then front switch.

1588
01:50:49,984 --> 01:50:51,109
Once more.

1589
01:50:51,651 --> 01:50:55,734
State governor went against
protocol and warned him.

1590
01:50:55,818 --> 01:50:57,276
That he shouldn't tour south.

1591
01:50:57,359 --> 01:51:02,943
No, I don't think LTF will
plan something this big. No.

1592
01:51:06,943 --> 01:51:08,818
First back switch,

1593
01:51:09,901 --> 01:51:11,526
then front switch.

1594
01:51:15,776 --> 01:51:20,109
We'll have to provide him with
full protection, at all cost.

1595
01:51:20,193 --> 01:51:24,734
Ex-PM or ex-minister, we
cannot provide NSG to anyone.

1596
01:51:24,818 --> 01:51:27,068
It is against the rules!
We cannot do it!

1597
01:51:27,151 --> 01:51:31,443
But if you insist, keeping
in mind the threat..

1598
01:51:31,526 --> 01:51:34,568
...we'll inform the state police.
They will look after it.

1599
01:51:34,734 --> 01:51:37,068
Fine. Whatever you deem fit.

1600
01:51:52,359 --> 01:51:53,026
Ghosh..
Sir.

1601
01:51:53,109 --> 01:51:55,068
Get me special access. I'm
about to reach the airport.

1602
01:51:55,151 --> 01:51:56,359
Now.
Okay, sir.

1603
01:52:06,901 --> 01:52:08,859
Good afternoon, sir. Robin Dutt.

1604
01:52:09,193 --> 01:52:10,651
I've a request to make, sir.

1605
01:52:10,984 --> 01:52:15,901
Kindly cancel your rallies for
today and for the next 2-3 days.

1606
01:52:16,693 --> 01:52:19,401
There's a threat. It will be
better if you avoid them.

1607
01:52:19,484 --> 01:52:23,401
You know I want to be with the
people for these elections.

1608
01:52:23,776 --> 01:52:25,234
There is security over there.

1609
01:52:25,318 --> 01:52:28,026
Yes, sir. It's there. But
it could be dangerous.

1610
01:52:28,276 --> 01:52:30,484
It's a request. Please
don't go there.

1611
01:52:31,026 --> 01:52:32,151
Sir, excuse me.

1612
01:52:32,859 --> 01:52:35,219
Pilot just informed. Flight
is ready for take off. Okay.

1613
01:52:36,901 --> 01:52:40,901
Robin, please don't worry.
I'll be fine. Okay?

1614
01:53:14,234 --> 01:53:16,068
He will be reaching
in ten minutes...

1615
01:53:24,234 --> 01:53:26,651
Everyone please co-operate
for the security check...

1616
01:53:26,734 --> 01:53:29,943
Please move behind
from the stage...

1617
01:53:30,234 --> 01:53:33,609
Ladies who will be garlanding,
please move to the front row.

1618
01:53:38,609 --> 01:53:40,193
Please maintain discipline...

1619
01:53:40,276 --> 01:53:43,276
...our leader will be
reaching in the next minutes.

1620
01:53:47,276 --> 01:53:49,734
Sir, here's the route map.
Rishi is already there.

1621
01:53:49,943 --> 01:53:50,943
Okay.

1622
01:53:57,651 --> 01:54:00,484
Vikram has reached. He's
on his way to the rally.

1623
01:54:00,859 --> 01:54:02,276
All units informed.

1624
01:54:02,943 --> 01:54:04,401
Routine scanning
is complete, sir.

1625
01:54:04,526 --> 01:54:06,193
Around 3000-3500 people.

1626
01:54:06,401 --> 01:54:07,568
He'll be here soon.

1627
01:54:07,651 --> 01:54:09,443
Keep checking, I'm coming.
Yes, sir.

1628
01:54:47,193 --> 01:54:49,318
Ex-PM has reached.

1629
01:56:15,776 --> 01:56:17,818
You're not allowed to go ahead!

1630
01:58:13,984 --> 01:58:18,568
We're sorry to inform you
that earlier tonight..

1631
01:58:18,818 --> 01:58:22,484
..lndia's former Prime
Minister was assassinated.

1632
01:58:24,151 --> 01:58:27,068
This dreadful blast
took place at 10:10pm.

1633
01:58:27,526 --> 01:58:29,651
He was in Poothiyaddur
district in South India,

1634
01:58:29,734 --> 01:58:32,026
to address an election rally.

1635
01:58:32,234 --> 01:58:35,901
In the south of India, this
sudden and tragic death..

1636
01:58:35,984 --> 01:58:38,443
..has left the whole nation
in a state of shock.

1637
01:58:38,943 --> 01:58:43,359
This is the first time a
human bomb has been used...

1638
01:58:43,693 --> 01:58:47,859
His unfortunate death has left
people in a state of shock.

1639
01:58:47,984 --> 01:58:50,193
The whole nation is mourning.

1640
01:58:50,568 --> 01:58:53,609
So far this blast has
claimed 25 people's lives,

1641
01:58:53,693 --> 01:58:55,568
and injured more
than 100 people.

1642
01:58:55,943 --> 01:58:58,484
A horrific blast took
place at 10:10pm.

1643
01:58:58,568 --> 01:59:02,193
This shocking incident has sent shock
waves across the entire nation.

1644
01:59:02,359 --> 01:59:04,239
Bringing the country to
a complete standstill.

1645
01:59:04,276 --> 01:59:06,484
The special investigation
squad has revealed..

1646
01:59:06,693 --> 01:59:09,068
..the use of plastic
explosives and RDX.

1647
01:59:09,359 --> 01:59:12,193
So far this blast has
claimed 25 people's lives,

1648
01:59:12,359 --> 01:59:14,109
and injured more
than 100 people.

1649
01:59:14,484 --> 01:59:17,068
They were those who
came to the rally...

1650
01:59:17,151 --> 01:59:18,901
...to support our
former prime minister.

1651
01:59:19,818 --> 01:59:20,901
Just like that.

1652
01:59:22,068 --> 01:59:23,693
What was his fault?

1653
01:59:24,901 --> 01:59:26,526
He was so young.

1654
01:59:26,943 --> 01:59:27,943
We tried.

1655
01:59:29,068 --> 01:59:30,931
But we lost.

1656
01:59:30,944 --> 01:59:32,818
President has requested
people to stay calm.

1657
01:59:32,943 --> 01:59:36,068
Leaders all across the world have
expressed their condolences.

1658
01:59:45,234 --> 01:59:48,401
After some time..'
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

1659
01:59:49,151 --> 01:59:52,318
The investigation team
arrested a few suspects.

1660
01:59:53,568 --> 01:59:56,901
And a few suspects committed suicide
before they could be arrested.

1661
02:00:11,234 --> 02:00:14,693
And I submitted my report to the
special investigation team.

1662
02:00:20,651 --> 02:00:23,401
This commission appreciates
your investigations.

1663
02:00:23,776 --> 02:00:25,443
And yes, we will consider them.

1664
02:00:25,526 --> 02:00:29,026
But, Mr. Vikram, we
need solid evidence.

1665
02:00:29,859 --> 02:00:31,234
I'd never realized that...

1666
02:00:31,318 --> 02:00:33,776
...the world is so threatened
by our Prime Minister.

1667
02:00:36,651 --> 02:00:39,026
RD sir resigned
after a few days.

1668
02:00:42,943 --> 02:00:45,318
I hope you've given this
decision of yours a thought.

1669
02:00:47,568 --> 02:00:48,568
Yes.

1670
02:00:55,609 --> 02:01:00,193
And I took a voluntary
retirement and came here.

1671
02:01:00,693 --> 02:01:04,943
Whatever you just said could
also be just a coincidence.

1672
02:01:05,818 --> 02:01:07,068
No, Father.

1673
02:01:07,276 --> 02:01:12,859
This conspiracy was played
out just as it was planned.

1674
02:01:13,984 --> 02:01:15,109
And I was late.

1675
02:01:17,901 --> 02:01:19,776
But I couldn't compete with him.

1676
02:01:21,026 --> 02:01:22,651
They were powerful.

1677
02:01:24,109 --> 02:01:26,734
And In this game we lost
our Prime Minister.

1678
02:01:27,943 --> 02:01:30,193
And the Lankan Tamils.
Their future.

1679
02:01:31,818 --> 02:01:32,818
Then who won?

1680
02:01:33,318 --> 02:01:34,484
I don't know.

1681
02:01:35,859 --> 02:01:37,318
Perhaps it was everyone's loss.

1682
02:01:38,943 --> 02:01:39,943
And Anna?

1683
02:01:41,859 --> 02:01:45,151
One man's revolutionary is
another man's terrorist.

1684
02:01:46,484 --> 02:01:49,026
Anna is revolutionary
for his people.

1685
02:01:51,234 --> 02:01:52,943
But I lost my Prime Minister.

1686
02:01:53,901 --> 02:01:55,193
What will you do now?

1687
02:01:59,151 --> 02:02:01,068
Ruby's father gave this to me...

1688
02:02:02,693 --> 02:02:04,443
...on our wedding day.

1689
02:02:04,943 --> 02:02:06,234
A wedding gift.

1690
02:02:09,859 --> 02:02:14,568
Where the mind is without fear
and the head is held high..

1691
02:02:15,734 --> 02:02:17,359
Where knowledge is free..

1692
02:02:19,359 --> 02:02:23,651
Where the world has not been
broken up into fragments..

1693
02:02:24,568 --> 02:02:26,651
By narrow domestic walls..

1694
02:02:27,901 --> 02:02:30,443
Where words come out from
the depth of truth..

1695
02:02:31,734 --> 02:02:35,234
Where tireless striving stretches
its arms towards perfection..

1696
02:02:36,859 --> 02:02:39,734
Where the clear stream of
reason has not lost its way..

1697
02:02:40,859 --> 02:02:43,151
Into the dreary desert
sand of dead habit..

1698
02:02:43,901 --> 02:02:46,234
Where the mind is led
forward by thee..

1699
02:02:46,734 --> 02:02:49,026
Into every-widening
thought and action..

1700
02:02:50,401 --> 02:02:52,943
Into that heaven of
freedom, my Father,

1701
02:02:53,901 --> 02:02:55,234
let my country awake..

1702
02:02:55,318 --> 02:02:56,318
Thank you.
