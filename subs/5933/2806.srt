1
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
片名：诸神之怒

2
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:42,340
远古时代 这个世界曾由神魔所统治
In ancient times, the world was ruled by gods and monsters.

3
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,440
但它却是我的儿子 - 半神珀尔修斯
But it was the half-god Perseus, my son...

4
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,320
打败了北海巨妖 拯救了人类
...who defeated the Kraken and saved humanity.

5
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,260
为了奖励他的勇敢 我在身边为他安排了一个神位
For his courage, I offered him a place to rule at my side.

6
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,760
但珀尔修斯…
But Perseus...

7
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,700
固执己见 做出了另外的选择
strong-willed and chose a different path

8
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,030
他发誓以人的身份生活
He vowed to live as a man.

9
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,070
即使命运夺去了他的妻子
Even when fate took his wife...

10
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,910
他仍不愿向我…
...he would not pray for help, from me...

11
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,110
或其他诸神祈求帮助
...or the other gods.

12
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,710
如今神的时代已近结束
And now the time of the gods is ending.

13
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:25,150
但宙斯之子却不能永远逃避自己的命运
But the son of Zeus cannot hide from his destiny forever.

14
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,900
现在拉它回来.再做一次
New pull it in. Dc it again.

15
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,000
快点把另一个也扔出去 继续 我把这个打个结
Throw in the other one real quick. Go on. I'll tie this off.

16
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,570
今天收获不错 爸爸
Goad catch today, Dad.

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,280
- 你从哪儿弄的那个东西？ - 我自己做的
- Where'd you get that? - I made it myself.

18
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,940
你自己做的？
You made it yourself? Heh.

19
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,680
我想做个好神 做些好事
I want to be a good god and do good things.

20
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,820
- 没有什么好神 - 有一些神是好的
- There's no such thing as good gods.- Some of them are good.

21
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,520
赫利俄斯 生活中不是只有神和泰坦
Ah. Helius, there's more to life than gods and Titans.

22
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,620
嘿 克莉亚 我要跟你认个错
Hey, Clea. I have a confession to make.

23
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,290
我刚才 嗯…需要他帮忙做事 所以他没来学习
I, uh, needed him for chores so he skipped studying.

24
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,270
现在 去好好学习 让我骄傲一下
Now, you do a good jab, make me proud.

25
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,190
我知道你在这儿
I know you're here.

26
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,170
我时常在他熟睡时来看他
I visit him sometimes in his dreams.

27
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,940
他就像他的父亲一样 一个意志坚强的孩子
He's like his father. A strong-willed bay.

28
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,510
你是顺路过来看看？
You just passing through?

29
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,810
不是
Na.

30
00:02:58,970 --> 00:02:59,850
我需要你的帮助
I need your help...

31
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,080
珀尔修斯
...Perseus.

32
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,380
你是万物之神宙斯 你不需要我的帮助
You're the great god Zeus. You don't need my help.

33
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,520
大灾变即将降临
There is a calamity coming.

34
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,690
它会影响到我们所有人 无论是神还是人
It will affect us all. Gods and men.

35
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,400
- 人类将不再向我们祈祷 - 理由不错
- The humans may have stopped praying to us... - With good reason.

36
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,090
但是会有后果发生
...but there are consequences.

37
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,500
没有了祈祷者 我们众神将失去力量
Without prayer, we gods lose our power.

38
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:24,370
当我们失去力量时 所有的努力都将付之一炬 所有的一切…
When our power leaves us, all our work comes undone. All of it.

39
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,750
地狱深渊的壁垒将崩塌
The walls of Tartarus are falling.

40
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,750
所有地狱中的恶魔将倾巢涌入凡间 第一个恶魔已经出现了
It is emptying all its demons onto the earth. The first are already here.

41
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,190
如果我们的力量进一步减弱  我们众神将沦为凡人
If our power diminishes much further, we gods will became mortal.

42
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,930
我们将会死去 库洛纳斯将会逃脱
We will die and Kronos himself will escape.

43
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,140
到那时会秩序混乱 即是世界的末日
It will mean chaos. The end of the world.

44
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,240
我能做些什么？
What am I meant to do?

45
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,410
这是神的事
This is business for gods.

46
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,580
如今我们需要我们所有的孩子
We need all our children now.

47
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,110
或许 团结一致
Perhaps, together...

48
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,750
我们就能补救这一切
...we can remedy this.

49
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,650
但我们需要每一份绵薄之力 珀尔修斯
But we need every shred of power, Perseus.

50
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,620
我不会丢下我的孩子
I will never leave my sun.

51
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:19,630
我比你更加了解你自己
I know your heart better then you know it yourself.

52
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,340
你一直相信 你人性的一面告诉你加入我们是不值得的
You believe your human half makes you unworthy to join us.

53
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,070
终有一日你会了解
You will learn someday that...

54
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,760
作为一个半神
...being half-human...

55
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,140
你比真神更加强大 而不是嬴弱
...makes you stranger than a god, not weaker.

56
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,170
我觉得你该走了
I think you should go.

57
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,250
好梦 珀尔修斯
Sleep well, Perseus.

58
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,460
我不会丢下我的孩子
I will never leave my son.

59
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,790
宙斯
Zeus.

60
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,270
波塞冬
Poseidon.

61
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,440
兄弟
Brother.

62
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,270
好久不见
It has been an age.

63
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,310
确实 很久了
Indeed, it has.

64
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,480
阿瑞斯
Ares.

65
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,690
我的孩子
My sun.

66
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:01,220
我的兄弟珀尔修斯在哪儿？
Where's my brother Perseus?

67
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,290
去打鱼了？
Gone fishing?

68
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,700
是的
Yes.

69
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,700
多么勇敢而高尚的决定
What a brave and noble decision.

70
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,640
那么 我们走
Let us go, then.

71
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,230
地狱深渊 冥界最大的监狱
Tartarus. The great prison of the underworld.

72
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,430
哈迪斯兄弟
Brother Hades!

73
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,600
我们依照协定
We have came to your domain...

74
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,760
来到了你的管辖区
...as agreed!

75
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,760
现身吧
Show yourself to us!

76
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,550
这么多年来
After so many years...

77
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,810
库洛纳斯的孩子们 再一次重聚
the sons of Kronos, together once more.

78
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,690
手足兄弟
Brothers in arms.

79
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,290
哈迪斯
Hades...

80
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:12,690
你是冥界最高的统治者
you are the great ruler of the underworld.

81
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,500
请允许我们进入并帮助你重建
Allow us to enter and help you rebuild...

82
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,900
地狱深渊的壁垒
...the walls of Tartarus.

83
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:22,400
我亲爱的兄弟 是你将我永远驱逐到这里
My beloved brother, who banished me here for eternity...

84
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,840
照顾我们的父亲 而如今
...to lack after our father, new seeks...

85
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,640
却要寻求和解
...reconciliation.

86
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,980
兄弟 我们要忘记过去
We must forget the past, brother...

87
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,380
团结一致
...and unite.

88
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,510
没错
Yes.

89
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,560
但是我说了算
But an my terms.

90
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:46,590
波塞冬
Poseidon!

91
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,740
在你上面
Above you!

92
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,010
波塞冬
Poseidon.

93
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,700
已经开始了
It has begun.

94
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,870
赫利俄斯？
Helius?!

95
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,740
赫利俄斯
Helius!

96
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,780
离它远点 离它远点
Stay away, stay away!

97
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,160
赫利俄斯？
Helius?

98
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:28,590
赫利俄斯
Helius.

99
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,560
怪兽
Chimera!

100
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,700
赫利俄斯
Helius!

101
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,130
你有看到赫利俄斯么?!
Have you seen Helius?!

102
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,940
赫利俄斯
Helius!

103
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,510
回来
Get back!

104
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,750
不要接近它会喷火
Keep away! Its venom catches fire!

105
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,490
趴下
Stay dawn!

106
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,610
赫利俄斯 跟他们走
Helius, go with them!

107
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,290
带走他
Take him!

108
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,690
我会找到你的走啊
I'll find you! Go!

109
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,430
快走!
Go!

110
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,030
- 爸爸 - 快走
- Dad! Run!

111
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:16,870
快走
Go!

112
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,240
赫利俄斯
Helius!

113
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,640
赫利俄斯
Helius!

114
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,820
- 爸爸 快 - 我来了 儿子
Dad, hurry! I'm coming, son!

115
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,820
赫利俄斯呆那儿别动
Helius! Stay there!

116
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,260
爸爸
HELIUS Dad!

117
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,340
赫利俄斯
Helius!

118
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,470
在这儿
Here!

119
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,070
来抓我啊
Came and get me!

120
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,520
你在等什么？烧死我啊
What are you waiting for?! Burn me!

121
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,670
坐下
Sit.

122
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,780
哦
Ohh.

123
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,950
在这个世界上
Things are happening...

124
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,890
已经有事开始发生了 珀尔修斯 你知道的 我能感受得到
...in the world, Perseus. You know that, you have instincts.

125
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,050
神之子
The sun of a god.

126
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:56,360
儿子需要父亲
A sun needs a father.

127
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,100
我曾对妻子发誓
I made a vow to la.

128
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:02,370
我懂 我懂 你孩子出生时候我在场
I know, I know, I was there delivering your sun.

129
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:05,270
你曾对你的妻子发誓 你永远不会让赫利俄斯使用武器
You vowed to your wife you'd never let Helius wield a sword.

130
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,610
你将与他一起作为打渔生活
That you'd live with him as a simple fisherman.

131
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:12,750
没错 和平时期这么做确实没错
Well, that's a fine game in normal times.

132
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,190
但是如果你有了力量 你也就有了责任
But if you have power, you also have a duty.

133
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,420
把我的身子治好
Just fix my body...

134
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,760
我的灵魂我自己做主
...and leave my soul to me.

135
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,590
你们要去哪儿？
Where are we going?

136
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,200
我要和我的父亲谈谈
I need to speak to my father.

137
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,340
没有什么好害怕的
There's nothing to be frightened cf.

138
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,480
这里就是万神殿
This is the Mount of Idols.

139
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,780
距离天堂最近的地方
The closest place to the heavens.

140
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:49,220
这儿就是人们来拜祭众神的地方
It's a place where people came to warship the gods.

141
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,960
至少他们曾经来过
Or at least they used to came.

142
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,600
宙斯？
Zeus?

143
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,530
父亲
Father.

144
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,860
波塞冬
Poseidon.

145
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:32,160
发生了什么？
What happened?

146
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,990
哈迪斯和阿瑞斯已经加入了库洛纳斯
Hades and Ares have joined Kronos...

147
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,860
共同对付人类
...against humanity.

148
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,030
所有的神都已经消失不见
All the gods have disappeared.

149
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:43,300
- 我最怕出现的情况 - 来 过来
- I fear the worst. - Here, here.

150
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,180
我扶着你
I got you, I got you.

151
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,070
我父亲在哪儿？
Where's my father?

152
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,480
被抓了
Captured.

153
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,180
你必须到冥界去解救他
You must journey to the underworld and free him.

154
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,210
他们抓走了我的父亲
They tank my father.

155
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,480
你是这个世界尚存的唯一希望
You're the only hope left in this world.

156
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,830
不然就全完了
Or there will be oblivion.

157
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,890
我该怎么做？
How do I do it?

158
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:12,940
我只是一个半神
I'm only half a god.

159
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,160
那你就要找到另一个半神
Then you must find another half-god.

160
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,670
阿格诺尔
Agenor.

161
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,840
他是我的儿子
He's my sun.

162
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,550
他和安德洛墨达公主在一起
He's with Queen Andromeda.

163
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,750
让他带你去找堕落者
Tell him to take you to the Fallen One.

164
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,720
波塞冬
Poseidon.

165
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,820
拿着这个 使用它
Take this. Use it.

166
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,460
如果我的儿子
If my sun...

167
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,230
能够活下来 就证明我把这个传给他
...survives and proves worthy...

168
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,470
是值得的
...give it to him.

169
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,640
我的亲儿子背叛了我
My awn sun betrays me.

170
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:30,980
只有你觉得情况合适时  你才会记得我就是你的儿子
Only when it suits you, you remember I am your son.

171
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,480
哈迪斯
Hades.

172
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:37,020
兄弟 你像个人类一样流汗 接下来 就会流泪
You're sweating like a human, brother. Next, it'll be tears.

173
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,880
别跟他废话
Don't waste wards an him.

174
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,990
库洛纳斯在等着
Kronos is waiting...

175
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,490
父亲
...Father.

176
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,160
怎么了？
What?

177
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,630
我们的父亲向我们提出一个交易
Our father has offered us a deal.

178
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,460
你个笨蛋
You foal!

179
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,670
如果我们能帮助他逃离地狱深渊
If we help him to escape Tartarus...

180
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:58,140
他答应允许我们少数几个神保持神性
...he will allow we few gods who remain to keep our immortality.

181
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,540
- 不! - 让他说话
- Na! - Let him speak.

182
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,510
让他说话
Let him speak.

183
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,310
你是不是变弱了？
Are you becoming weak?

184
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,020
你现在在冥界 阿瑞斯 我的地盘 你最好听我的
You're in the underworld, Ares, where it's wise to obey me.

185
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,290
我们的父亲曾想杀掉我们 你忘记了？
You forget our father once tried to kill us.

186
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,690
没有 我什么都记得
Na, I remember everything.

187
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:23,360
我们的父亲究竟想从我们这里得到什么？ 而回报是宝贵的神性
And what exactly does our father want from us in return for our precious immortality?

188
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,800
我们仅仅是把你仅存的圣神力量提供给他 这样他就能让自己自由
We simply offer him the last of your divine powers so that he may free himself.

189
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,970
哦 哈迪斯
Oh, Hades.

190
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,970
我都对你做了什么？
What have I done to you?

191
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,020
你笑得好像你还有选择
You laugh as if you had a choice.

192
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,990
没有选择了
There is no choice.

193
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,100
我希望你已经受够他们了
I hope you have enough of them.

194
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,500
拉他起来
Pull him.

195
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,420
你比我更需要它
You'll need it more than me.

196
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:28,790
天马
Pegasus.

197
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,700
去吧
Go on.

198
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,010
他喜欢你
He likes you.

199
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,420
而我 在另一方面
Me, on the other hand...

200
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,220
我爱你
I love you.

201
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,900
我知道
I know.

202
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,170
走吧
Came an.

203
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,600
嘿 哇 向前直飞 干得不错
Eh, whoa. Keep it straight. Have it lack good.

204
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,100
来吧 伙计
Came an, bay.

205
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:53,480
更多怪兽弓箭手
More Chimera! Archers!

206
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,980
快 快 快
Go, go, go!

207
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,490
准备发射
Ready! Fire!

208
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,320
怪兽 准备
Chimera! Ready!

209
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,120
保持队形 保持队形
Hold your lines. Hold your lines!

210
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,030
让开路
Out of the way!

211
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,330
停止攻击
Hold your fire!

212
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,600
我命令你们停止攻击
- I said hold your fire! Queen Andromeda.

213
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,810
啊 保持直线飞 就这样
Ah, keep it straight. Oy!

214
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,050
哇
Whoa!

215
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:34,150
你以前可比这厉害多了
You used to be a lot better at this.

216
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:41,430
全体向您致敬 珀尔修斯 北海巨妖杀手
All hail Perseus, killer of the Kraken.

217
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,570
向您致敬 珀尔修斯
Hail Perseus!

218
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,370
伟大的珀尔修斯
Great Perseus.

219
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,740
如果你追求的是战斗 你有点来晚了
If it is action you're after, you are a little late.

220
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,580
我只是来参见安德洛墨达公主的
I'm just here to see Queen Andromeda.

221
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:00,050
这里是战场
This is a battlefield.

222
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,550
这儿我是指挥官 嗯
- I am in command here. - Uh-huh.

223
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,050
好吧 我想和公主谈谈
Well, I wish to speak to the queen.

224
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,560
正好公主也有话要和你谈谈
And the queen wishes to speak to you.

225
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,790
女王殿下
Your Majesty.

226
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,160
来吧
Came an.

227
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,170
向您致敬 珀尔修斯
Hail Perseus.

228
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:31,050
很明显你身处自己的战争中 珀尔修斯
You've obviously been in your own battles, Perseus.

229
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,950
我也正忙着打我的战争
I've been busy with mine.

230
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,810
是的 没错
Yeah, you have.

231
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,990
我不会勉强你
I won't keep you.

232
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,060
都过去很久了
It's been tan lung.

233
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,970
- 我现在有一个儿子 - 我知道 我想见见他
- I have a sun now. - I know. I'd like to meet him.

234
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
- 我的妻子 她… - 我知道
And my wife, she... - I know.

235
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,640
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

236
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,610
女王殿下
Your Majesty.

237
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:10,150
为了人类 我们必须在日落前解决我们的分歧
For the sake of the men, we must resolve our differences before sunset.

238
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,150
我说的很清楚 我会继续战斗
I made it clear we continue to fight...

239
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,850
抵抗怪兽入侵
...the Chimera invaders.

240
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,460
今天在战场我们失去了300人
Today in the field we last 300 men...

241
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,290
而目前只杀掉了4头怪兽 我们
...for the death of four Chimera. We have...

242
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:22,830
触怒了众神.我们需要祈祷
offended the gods. We need to pray.

243
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:24,590
也许 你要向战神阿瑞斯祈祷？
You'd pray to Ares, perhaps?

244
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,970
战士们都会这么做
As soldiers always have.

245
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:29,930
如果我告诉你阿瑞斯现在是你们的敌人 你怎么想？
What if I was to tell you that Ares is your enemy now?

246
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,540
我会同他讲和
I would make peace with him.

247
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,840
你想同战神讲和？
You would make peace with the god of war?

248
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,310
珀尔修斯
Perseus.

249
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,150
你有什么战略？
What's your strategy?

250
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:44,150
有一种方法我们可以解决这一切 然后平安回家
There's a way we can end this, and then I can get home.

251
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,220
- 你这是要干什么？ - 我要为我的战船刻船舱
- What is this far? - It's to cut the cars for my trireme.

252
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,480
我需要110间船舱
I need 110 cars...

253
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:50,120
目前这三行
...for the three rows...

254
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:50,950
每行一个人
...one oar per man.

255
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,130
这个看起来像偷的
This lacks like a pick.

256
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:55,700
- 没错 但它是我船上的方向舵 - 安静
- It is, however, the rudder for my flagship.- Quiet!

257
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,160
早间审讯 女王殿下
Morning checks, Your Majesty.

258
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,540
总是充满变故
Always eventful.

259
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,800
哦 女王殿下 很高兴见到你
Oh, Your Majesty. Ah. Sc good to see you.

260
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,780
这就是阿格诺尔 他是个骗子 也是个贼 我知道我们之间不可能
- This is Agenor. He's a liar and a thief. I know it didn't work out between us...

261
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,240
但是 请 试着忘记它吧
...but, please, do try and get over it.

262
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,850
你有没有一个如此深爱你的女人
Have you ever had a woman love you so much...

263
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,050
她会像宠物兔子一样把你绑起来？
...she lacks you up like a pet rabbit?

264
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,980
他想通过婚姻关系寻求我的帮助
He wanted my hand in marriage.

265
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,090
当我拒绝时 他设法带着皇冠上的珠宝逃走
When I refused, he tried to run away with the crown jewels.

266
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,350
我想这就是因为我非凡的眼睛
I think it's my extraordinary eyes.

267
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,930
实际上 你有你父亲的眼睛
Actually, you gut the eyes of your father.

268
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:29,190
你认识他父亲？
Do you know his father?

269
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,490
是的 这个阿格诺尔
Yeah, Agenor here...

270
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,870
他是海神波塞冬的儿子
...he's the son of the great god Poseidon.

271
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:39,870
你的新男朋友很明显疯掉了
Your new boyfriend is clearly insane.

272
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:42,110
我是你的兄弟  阿格诺尔
I'm your cousin, Agenor.

273
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,040
我是宙斯的儿子
I'm the sun of Zeus.

274
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,350
我是半神 和你一样被遗弃了
Half-god and abandoned just like you.

275
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:50,910
如果是我的父亲派你来
If my father sent you...

276
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,060
我不想跟你有任何瓜葛
...I want nothing to do with you.

277
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,720
你的父亲已经死了
Your father is dead.

278
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,420
神是不会死的
Gods don't die.

279
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,230
如今他们确实会
They do now.

280
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:02,400
好啊 能帮我个忙么？
Goad. Could you do me a favor?

281
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,630
- 任何事 - 下地狱去吧
Anything. - Go to hell.

282
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,870
那正是我要做的事
That's exactly where I'm going.

283
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:12,970
我只是需要些信息
I just need information.

284
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:15,480
你的父亲告诉我说
Your father told me...

285
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,880
你能帮助我找到堕落者
...that you could help me get to the Fallen One.

286
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,220
你很向往大海 不是么？
You long for the ocean, don't you?

287
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,790
就像是永远无法解除的饥渴感
It's like a thirst you cannot quench.

288
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:35,160
在这儿对你来说就是地狱
It must be hell for you in here.

289
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:45,170
我要皇家赦免
I want a royal pardon.

290
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:48,970
同意
Granted.

291
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,750
我要和我体重一样重的金子
I want my body weight in gold.

292
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,140
同意
Granted.

293
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,510
Few gold coins, you're so scrawny. 几乎没有金币 你太瘦了
Few gold coins, you're so scrawny.

294
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,850
让我想想 当我在监狱里躺着的时候 还梦到了什么？
Let me see. What else have I dreamt of as I lay here in my cell?

295
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:02,390
别太过分了
Don't push it.

296
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,600
我需要一条船 你这儿最快的船
I'm gonna need a boat, your fastest boat.

297
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,030
堕落者住在海洋那边很远的地方
The Fallen One lives far across the ocean.

298
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,700
在哪儿？
Where?

299
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:13,630
当我双脚踏上船板的时候 我会告诉你
Well, put me on the deck of the boat and I'll show you.

300
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,340
你的船在等你
Your ship awaits.

301
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:24,180
把我的幸运斗篷拿来
Fetch my lucky cape.

302
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:29,990
老家伙 你知道为什么这个叫我的幸运斗篷么？
Do you know why this is my lucky cape, me old mate?

303
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:34,150
因为我第一次穿它的时候 我开始长胡子 密密麻麻的胡子
Because the first time I ware it, I sprouted a beard. A full-grown beard.

304
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,990
给每个军团的人发消息
Send ward to every regiment...

305
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:39,220
在帝龙关口集合的命令仍然不变
...that's still intact to gather here at the Tyrene pass.

306
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:42,970
如果两天后我不在这儿
If I'm not there in two days...

307
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,060
你就可以祈祷了
...then you can pray.

308
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,440
女王殿下
Your Majesty.

309
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,070
- 要塞重新编队 - 你不能
Regroup at the garrison! You can't leave...

310
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:53,140
让希腊没有公主
...Greece without a queen.

311
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:56,450
你是在对我下命令么？
Are you giving me orders now?

312
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,400
把他解开
Unchain him.

313
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,360
告诉我堕落者在哪儿
Show me where the Fallen One is.

314
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,370
谁是堕落者？
Who is the Fallen One?

315
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:27,740
哦 是火神赫淮斯托斯 哦 哦
Oh, the god Hephaestus. Heh, heh.

316
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,610
谁是赫淮斯托斯？
And who's Hephaestus?

317
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:36,420
赫淮斯托斯为海神波塞冬做了三叉戟
Hephaestus was the god that made Poseidon's trident...

318
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,720
为冥王哈迪斯做了草叉
Hades' pitchfork...

319
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,290
还为宙斯做了闪电剑
...and Zeus' thunderbolt.

320
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,420
所有这些放在一起
Put those together...

321
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,890
成为胜利之矛 众神用来击败库洛纳斯
...they farm the Spear of Trium, the weapon the gods used...

322
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,530
的武器
to defeat Kronos.

323
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,760
但是赫淮斯托斯住在凯尔之岛 哈哈
But Hephaestus lives on the island of Kail. Ha-ha-ha.

324
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,400
没有人知道岛在哪儿
Which no one has ever found.

325
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:55,570
凯尔岛不存在 是么？阿格诺尔
Kail doesn't exist, does it, Agenor'?

326
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,740
它确实
It dues...

327
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,210
存在 我能带你去那
...exist. I can take you.

328
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,600
帮我解开 把三叉戟给我
Unchain me and give me the trident.

329
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:06,150
如果你帮他解开 他就会跳下船 你永远也不要想见到他
If you unchain him, he'll jump off this boat, you'll never see him again.

330
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,510
赫淮斯托斯能帮你救出你的父亲
Hephaestus can help you save your father.

331
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,740
别让我们的家人失望
Don't let our family dawn.

332
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,470
从没有怀疑过你 阿格诺尔
Never doubted you for a second, Agenor.

333
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,040
伟大的库洛纳斯
Great Kronos.

334
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,230
父亲
Father.

335
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:44,310
我们把您的儿子 宙斯带来了
We have delivered Zeus, your sun...

336
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,480
按照您的指令
...as you ordered.

337
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:52,880
宙斯
Zeus.

338
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,900
凯尔岛
Island of Kail.

339
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,410
我不会再碰那个了
I'm not touching that again.

340
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,920
那是什么？
What is it?

341
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:38,890
我不知道 不管是谁这么做的 都不想让我们在这里
I dun'! know. But whoever did this doesn't want us here.

342
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,090
我们没有退路
We have no choice.

343
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,530
堕落之神不得不住的尽可能靠近天堂
Fallen god has to live as close to the heavens as possible.

344
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,770
有河流流过
Streams run through.

345
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:46,740
高地在那边
Higher ground's that way.

346
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,200
- 怎么了？ - 快看
What...?! Lack!

347
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:17,300
别动
Don't move!

348
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:27,980
我什么都看不到了
I can't see nothing.

349
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,180
我们应该向战神祈祷 战士们
We should pray to the god of war. - Warriors!

350
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,920
我知道这是你们的习惯 但是不管我们要面对的是什么
I know it is your custom, but no matter what we're about to face...

351
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,860
你不要向阿瑞斯祈祷
you do not pray to Ares.

352
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:40,350
如果你们这么做了 他会找到我们 把我们杀光
If you do, he will find us and kill us all.

353
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,490
靠近
Close in.

354
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,830
保持警惕
Stay alert.

355
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,740
绊网
Trip wire.

356
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:56,350
- 阿格诺尔! - 是的 是的 看到了
- Agenor! - Yeah, yeah. Saw it.

357
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,050
最重要的事就是什么都不要做
The most important thing is to do nothing.

358
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,110
没什么 我能做好
Nothing, I can do well.

359
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,230
啊为了宙斯之爱
Aah! For the lave of Zeus!

360
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:15,020
我告诉你什么都不要做
I told you to do nothing!

361
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:16,290
我什么也没做啊
I didn't do anything!

362
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:19,560
不 不 不
Na, nu, nu!

363
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,900
把负重砍掉
Cut the counterweights.

364
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,210
别砍掉负重
Don't cut the counterweight!

365
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,350
没错 他是对的 高空坠落会要了他的命
Yeah, he's right, the fall will kill him.

366
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:48,730
砍掉负重 砍掉负重
Cut the counterweight! Cut the counterweight!

367
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:55,900
阿格诺尔!
PERSEUS Agenor!

368
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,940
砍掉负重 砍掉负重
Cut the counterweight! Cut the counterweight!

369
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,370
阿格诺尔!
PERSEUS Agenor!

370
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,740
阿格诺尔!
Agenor

371
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,230
哦 开什么玩笑
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

372
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:36,540
趴下
Stay dawn!

373
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,470
啊
Ah!

374
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,380
那是什么？
What is it?

375
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,840
很大
Big.

376
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,540
安德洛墨达 把他打倒
Andromeda, slaw him dawn!

377
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,290
现在
NOW!

378
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,300
弓箭手
Archers!

379
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:00,400
加莱纳斯
Galenos...

380
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:02,870
- 去帮帮他 - 你 跟着我
- ... give him support. - You, fallow me.

381
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,120
不
Na!

382
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,220
我向您祈祷 伟大战神阿瑞斯 我向您祈祷
I pray to you, great god Ares. I pray to you-

383
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:56,620
嘘嘘
Shh.

384
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,830
它走了？
Is it gone?

385
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,750
嘿
Hey!

386
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,950
这不是个好主意
This is gonna be a bad idea.

387
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:40,590
我的兄弟在哪儿？
Where's my cousin?

388
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,580
很高兴你还活着吊在那儿
Glad you're hanging in there.

389
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,770
是啊 我以为我把他看了一个满眼
Yeah, I thought I'd give him an eyeful.

390
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,180
那边是在干什么？
What was that far?

391
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,990
海神波塞冬
Poseidon.

392
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,470
可怜的阿瑞斯 总是
Poor Ares, always...

393
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,110
遵循命令
following orders.

394
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,220
我自己说了算
I am my awn master.

395
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:36,520
是啊 当然你是
Yes, of course you are.

396
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,550
也许只是人类
Perhaps it's only humans...

397
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,990
才有自由意愿
...that have free will.

398
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,330
就是这个
There.

399
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:51,530
疼痛作为人类的教训
Pain! Your lesson in being human.

400
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,670
你为什么不哭？
Why don't you weep?

401
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:56,030
为什么你不像你宠爱的儿子珀尔修斯那样哭？
Why not weep like your favorite sun, Perseus?

402
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:04,050
如果我哭 那也是为了你 阿瑞斯
If I weep, it will be for you, Ares.

403
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:07,180
阿瑞斯
Ares.

404
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,050
住手
Enough.

405
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,480
为你的儿子哭泣吧
Weep for your son!

406
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,060
我说过
I said...

407
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,490
住手吧
enough!

408
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,820
这事你我都逃不了干系 哈迪斯
We are in this together, Hades.

409
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,160
不要现在就闹分歧
Dc not weaken now.

410
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:24,170
你的弱点就是你对你父亲和兄弟盲目的憎恨
Your weakness is your blind hatred for your father and your brother.

411
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:29,360
你不知道什么时候该停止战斗
You don't know when to stop fighting.

412
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,540
你已经赢了
You've already wan.

413
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:35,340
库洛纳斯在汲取宙斯的力量
Kronos is draining Zeus' power.

414
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:23,460
赫淮斯托斯
Hephaestus.

415
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,580
宙斯？
Zeus?

416
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,510
阿瑞斯
Ares!

417
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,480
哈迪斯
Hades!

418
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:51,220
终于我就知道你们会来
At last! I knew you'd came.

419
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:54,860
波塞冬 我能看到你的三叉戟在发光
Poseidon, I can see your trident glinting.

420
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,760
哈哈哈哈
Ha-ha-ha. Ah.

421
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:00,990
不是
It's not...

422
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,220
他们
...them.

423
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,430
我们在找赫淮斯托斯 那个
We're lacking for Hephaestus, the maker...

424
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:11,130
- 这样强力武器的制造者 - 好吧 我们要让他们进来么？
...of such mighty weapons. Well, should I let them in'?

425
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,830
他说了不行!
He says nu!

426
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:18,340
但是他总是说不
But then he always says nu.

427
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,320
他总是说
He always says...

428
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,790
不
...no.

429
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:26,680
啊
Ahh.

430
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,850
没错
Yes.

431
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,500
你是珀尔修斯
You are Perseus...

432
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,900
宙斯的儿子
son of Zeus.

433
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,530
是我
I am.

434
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,270
“击败北海巨妖怪”的那位
"Release the Kraken," all of that.

435
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,080
- 是 - 你是谁？
Yeah. - Who are you?

436
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:53,810
我是阿格诺尔 波塞冬之子
I'm Agenor, son of Poseidon.

437
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,540
阿格诺尔
HEPHAESTUS Agenor.

438
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,990
你有没有听说过阿格诺尔？
Have you ever heard of Agenor'?

439
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:02,320
从没听说过你
Never heard of you.

440
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,660
好吧 你的朋友也许听说过我的名头
Well, your friend may also know me by the name...

441
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,930
那个领航员
...the Navigator.

442
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,090
领航员？
Navigator?

443
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,400
领航员
Navigator!

444
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:17,900
还是不知道
Still nu.

445
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:21,070
别担心 孩子 他说有很多没有用的半神
Don't worry, son, he says there are many useless demigods.

446
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:25,450
“没有用”？和你独眼朋友们一样无用
"Useless"? About as useless as your one-eyed friends.

447
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,670
那些独眼巨人们
Those Cyclopes...

448
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,450
帮我铸造了神的武器
...helped me forge the god-weapons.

449
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,580
尊重一下他们
Have respect.

450
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,590
“领航员”
"Navigator. "

451
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:40,230
嗯
Mm-hm.

452
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:42,890
等等 因为…
Hold an, because...

453
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:47,860
波塞冬死了 宙斯被抓 那些监护者
Poseidon dead, Zeus captured. The wards...

454
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,530
甚至都没坐在一起
don't even sit together.

455
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,570
我们需要你的帮助解救宙斯
We need your help to rescue Zeus...

456
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:53,370
这样他就可以阻止库洛纳斯
so he can stop Kronos.

457
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:57,540
- 那就是计划 是么？ - 是的
- That's the plan, is it? Yeah.

458
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:01,580
好吧 既然这样 我们最好做好准备
Right. Right. Well, in that case, we'd best prepare.

459
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,310
为了什么？ 世界的终结
For what? - The end of the bloody world.

460
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,460
库洛纳斯会毁灭世界
Kronos will dismantle the earth.

461
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,790
你们会变成宇宙中飞散漂浮的碎片
You'll be scattered across the universe.

462
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:11,390
太棒了
Fantastic.

463
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,960
你铸造了这些武器
You forged these weapons...

464
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,900
就在这儿 为了众神 你一定能帮助我们
...right here for the gods. You must be able to help us.

465
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,630
闭嘴我还怎么能帮你们
Shut it! How could I...

466
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:22,270
当我已经没有了神的力量？
...when I've no godly power anymore?

467
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:23,240
他在和谁说话？
Who's he talking to?

468
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,810
你们不要
Don't you...

469
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,240
离开我
...walk away from me.

470
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,140
他全能的父亲把神的力量从我这儿夺走
His all-powerful father tank it away from me...

471
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:32,180
就因为在一次小的家庭纠纷中 我站在了哈迪斯一边
...when I sided with Hades in their little family argument.

472
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:36,410
没错 我知道那是一个错误
Yes, I know new it was a mistake!

473
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,820
人们会忘记
People forget!

474
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:43,850
最开始 哈迪斯很聪明
In the beginning, Hades was wise...

475
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:47,830
公正 强壮
...and just and strung.

476
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:51,530
如果不是因为你的父亲沉迷于力量
It were your daddy became drunk an power.

477
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,030
我们甚至希望
We were even hoping...

478
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:58,700
当宙斯来的时候 他会认清他的错误并恢复我们的
when Zeus came he might see his mistake and restore our...

479
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,180
为什么不？他会的 他会来的
Why not? He might have, had he came.

480
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:09,950
对不起
I'm sorry...

481
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:13,110
你以为作为人类远远不够.但是我们人类
...that you think being human is not enough. But we humans...

482
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,780
总是在没有希望的时候心存希望
hope when there's no hope.

483
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:19,660
在不该相信的时候坚信不移
And we believe when to believe is idiotic.

484
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,670
但是有时 不管
But sometimes, in spite...

485
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:25,300
怎么样 我们会战胜一切
of everything, we prevail.

486
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,660
现在
Now...

487
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,570
你们两个中
...which of you two...

488
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:34,510
谁说了算？
...is in charge?

489
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:36,070
- 我 - 那么
- I am. - Then...

490
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:40,450
如果我们是神
...if we were gods...

491
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:43,850
你会怎样帮助我们解救宙斯？
...how would you help us free Zeus?

492
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,190
哦 亲爱的
Oh, my dear.

493
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:50,760
你让我想起了某个人
You remind me of someone.

494
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:55,460
爱神阿佛洛狄忒
Aphrodite.

495
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,390
她是我的妻子
She was my wife.

496
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:03,000
跟我来
Came with me.

497
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,940
如果宙斯被囚抓到冥界
If Zeus is captive in the underworld...

498
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:09,240
他很有可能被困在地狱深渊的最深处
...he's likely being held in the heart of Tartarus.

499
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:13,750
在他的生命被完全侵蚀掉以前
There can't be much time before his life farce...

500
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:15,040
没有多少时间了
...is completely sapped.

501
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:17,050
我们怎么找到他？
But how do we get to him?

502
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,580
我们做不到
We can't.

503
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,620
正常情况下 你是对的 年轻人
Normally you'd be right, young man.

504
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:29,560
但是当我设计这个奇迹时
But when I designed this marvel...

505
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,460
我留下了一个秘密通道 一个捷径
...I included a secret passage, a shortcut...

506
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:33,690
如果你愿意那么叫的话
...if you will.

507
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:36,000
你设计的地狱深渊 哦 是的
- You designed Tartarus? Oh, aye.

508
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:38,060
我还亲自建造它
And built it.

509
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:40,740
阿佛洛狄忒 我能
Aphrodite, I could...

510
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:43,210
不仅把你们带进去
not only get you inside...

511
00:45:43,370 --> 00:45:46,750
我还能带你们在里面参观一番
...I could give you a guided tour.

512
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,420
为了让地狱深渊的监狱
In order for the prison of Tartarus...

513
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:55,820
坚不可摧
...to be completely impregnable...

514
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:58,930
我是从外面开始向内建造
...I built it from the outside in.

515
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,930
所以我要给自己留个能够当工程完工时
So I had to leave a passage for meself to get cut...

516
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:04,970
全身出来的通道 这个迷宫
...when the work was done. And this labyrinth...

517
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:08,330
是人类能够穿越冥界
...is the only way a human can travel through the underworld...

518
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:12,300
而且能够到达地狱深渊最深处的唯一方式
...and get to the heart of Tartarus.

519
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:46,500
我那个狂吼的混蛋儿子阿瑞斯在哪儿？
Where's my snarling bastard of a sun Ares?

520
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:50,440
库洛纳斯已经放弃他了？
Will Kronos really spare him'?

521
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,140
还有你？
And you?

522
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,380
这就没个完么？
Is there no end to this?

523
00:46:58,110 --> 00:46:59,280
我很害怕 兄弟
I'm afraid, brother.

524
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,650
你就想让我说这个？ 我是个神 我很还害怕
Is that what you want me to say? I'm a god and I'm afraid.

525
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:03,790
好吧 你应该的
Well, you should be.

526
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:08,590
当你珍贵的人类死掉时  至少他们的灵魂会去别处
When your precious humans die, at least their souls go to another place.

527
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:12,100
当一个神死掉时 那不是死亡
When a god dies, it isn't death.

528
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:14,500
只是遁入虚无
It's just absence.

529
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,240
什么都没有了
It's nothing.

530
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,510
永久的虚无
It's oblivion.

531
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,540
永久的虚无
It's oblivion.

532
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:30,840
珀尔修斯
Perseus.

533
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:36,050
珀尔修斯
Perseus.

534
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:38,700
父亲
Father.

535
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,560
我很接近了
I'm close.

536
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,530
继续和我联系
Stay with me.

537
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:47,390
你看 如果你能正确地沿边缘排成一行
You see, if you align the edges correctly...

538
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,270
它会给你展示内部移动变换的样子
...it gives you a shifting depiction of the interior.

539
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,240
我可以说 这简直就是杰作
Can I say, that is a masterpiece.

540
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,240
好吧 对于画来说很受用
Well, useful to a paint.

541
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:57,000
- 能让卑微的领航员拿一会儿么？ - 不能
- Would you let a lowly navigator hold it? - Na.

542
00:47:57,170 --> 00:48:00,410
好吧 你是波塞冬之子
Well, you are the sun of Poseidon.

543
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:05,120
是他教给我怎样导航的 怎样勾引
He's the one who taught me to navigate. That, and haw to seduce a mermaid...

544
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,690
偶尔出现的美人鱼 但实际上她们出现的频率
...which seemed random, but came in handy more often...

545
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:10,220
比你想象的频繁.要做的是
...than you'd think. Thing to dais...

546
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:13,230
别和她们说话 和她们的朋友说话
don't talk to her, talk to her friend.

547
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:19,930
领航员 这里就是迷宫的入口
Navigator, this is the entrance to the labyrinth.

548
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:24,230
有上百的门 所有的门都会杀了你们
There are hundreds of doors, all of which would kill you...

549
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,110
只有一个安全的门 你看
...save one. You see...

550
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:28,710
我设计这个是为了
...I designed it to play...

551
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:31,280
愚弄你们的心智 毕竟
...tricks with the mind. After all, the mind...

552
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,940
心灵是所有一切的最大陷阱
...is the greatest trap of all.

553
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:36,090
所以你们要控制你们的恐惧
Sc you've got to central your fears...

554
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,740
这样你们就不会背叛自己或者对方
so you don't turn on yourself or each other...

555
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:41,120
如果你们想要到达地狱深渊的话
...if you wanna make it to Tartarus.

556
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:49,590
到了
There it is.

557
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,960
这儿就是我们的门
There's our dour.

558
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,600
大家后退
Everybody back!

559
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:08,410
哦
Oh.

560
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:11,080
你们中谁对他祈祷过？
Which one of you prayed to him?!

561
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:44,150
你背叛了我们的父亲
You betrayed our father.

562
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:46,890
他背叛了我
He betrayed me...

563
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:49,180
因为他选择了你

伟大的神阿瑞斯

我们是兄弟

573
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:08,560
但是却不平等
...but not equal.

574
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:16,400
我要给他们争取多一点时间

575
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:28,650
最后一件神圣的东西

586
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:52,510
窝囊废？

哦 卡丽娜
Oh, Korrina.

590
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:26,670
她就是个傻瓜居然向他祈祷
She was a foal to pray to him...

591
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:30,880
可是他杀了弱者 他就是个胆小鬼
...and he was a coward to kill the weak.

592
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,650
他在很多战争中战斗过
He has fought in many wars.

593
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:36,020
许多世纪以来他总是残杀无辜

594

那就是所有
It's all...

595
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:38,820
他知道的事
...he knows.

596
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:41,560
我不能打败他
I can't beat him.

597
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,320
木头脑袋
Mutton head.

598
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:47,060
两天前 我被困在一个地牢的监狱里 不得不承认
Two days ago I was trapped in a cell in a dungeon, admittedly...

599
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:50,370
我试过逃跑 我不配做波塞冬的儿子
...trying to escape, unbecoming of the sun of Poseidon.

600
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:55,040
但是今天 我来到了这里 我要试着拯救这个世界

...I realize in a labyrinth with a million possibilities...

604
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:13,390
但这是你最不想听到的
...this is the last thing you want to hear...

605
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:16,470
但是请跟紧我
...but fallow me.

606
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:22,840

00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:28,410
或者这边
Or this way.

608
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:48,690
我不知道
I don't know...

609
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,890
没有赫淮斯托斯我们怎么通过这里？
...haw we'll get through this without Hephaestus.

610
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,140
珀尔修斯
Perseus.

611
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,250
你的儿子在哪儿？

这边
This way.

这边
This way!

615
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:01,590
安德洛墨达
Andromeda.

616
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:04,770
卡丽娜
Korrina.

617
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:07,440
你必须回来
You must turn back.

618
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:16,450
这里本应该是
This should be...

619
00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:18,780
一条走廊.这张地图讲不通
...a corridor. This map makes no sense.

620
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:20,510
安德洛墨达
Andromeda.

621
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,390
我们周围有什么东西
There's something in here with us.

622
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:30,870
- 把地图给我 - 不

624
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:35,530
- 为雕像摆姿势么？ - 阿格诺尔
- ... posing for a statue? - Agenor...

625
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:38,670
- 把地图给我 - 这张地图没有用
- ... just give me the map! - The map is useless!

626
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:48,340
这边
This way!

627
00:55:54,110 --> 00:55:54,850
阿格诺尔!

这儿很冷 不是么？

640
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:31,340
你不是真实的

赫利俄斯？
Helius?

642
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:05,910
你为什么要这么做？ 求你了 爸爸 别杀我
Why are you doing this? Please, Dad, don't kill me.

643
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:08,330
- 珀尔修斯 - 珀尔修斯

644

发生了什么？
What happened?

645
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:17,630
地狱深渊
Tartarus.

646
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:21,500

库洛纳斯现在有自己的力量了
Kronos has his power now.

649
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:39,360
哈迪斯
Hades.

650
01:01:41,830 --> 01:01:43,270
我很抱歉
I am so sorry.

651
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:45,260

652
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,500
驱逐你
For having banished you.

653
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:51,410
你能原谅我么？
Can you forgive me for that?

654
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:54,170
为什么要这么问？

655
01:01:55,770 --> 01:01:58,480
因为我会为了这个而原谅你

656
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:02,520
放开我 哈迪斯

我知道你内心还是善良的

你阻止不了的
You can't stop this.

663
01:02:46,590 --> 01:02:47,900
阿瑞斯

669
01:03:41,710 --> 01:03:43,210
珀尔修斯
Perseus.

670
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,520
珀尔修斯 我的孩子
Perseus, my sun.

671
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,910
用你身体里的力量
Use the power inside you.

672
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:33,770
珀尔修斯
Perseus...

673
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:34,640

675
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:19,620

不
Na!

678
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:52,150
哈迪斯
Hades.

679
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:02,790
武器 把武器给我
Weapon. Give it to me.

680
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:05,630
抓住他们
Hold them.

681
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:40,970
马提亚斯,干得不错
Mantius, impressive.

682
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:44,800
你集合了一只不错的军队 我已经准备皇家帐篷
- You gathered a fine army. - I have prepared a royal tent.

683
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,570
神住合适么？
And is it fit for a god?

684
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,800
伟大的宙斯 伟大的宙斯

685
01:06:48,970 --> 01:06:50,470
伟大的宙斯
Great Zeus.

686
01:06:56,570 --> 01:06:57,240
库洛纳斯
Kronos...

687
01:06:57,410 --> 01:07:00,220
会来找我的 珀尔修斯
...will came for me, Perseus.

688
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:02,990
我没有力量来阻止他了
I don't have the power left to stop him.

689
01:07:06,050 --> 01:07:07,080
我想
I wanted...

690
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,700
留给你一个安全的世界 但是我失败了
...to leave the world safe for you. I failed.

691
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,760
我原本应该和你一起的
I should have came with you.

692
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:14,420
- 我只是 - 你帮我
- I was just- You pulled me...

693
01:07:14,590 --> 01:07:16,500
逃出了地狱深渊
out of Tartarus.

694
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:19,170
是你救了我
You saved me.

695
01:07:20,330 --> 01:07:22,810
你怎么知道你会那么做？
How do you suppose you did that?

696
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:26,770
我从来没停止想过和我的儿子一起回家
I never stopped thinking about getting home to my sun.

697
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:29,820
那么使用它吧 为了你的儿子
Then you use that. Fight for your sun.

698
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,110
记住
Remember:

699
01:07:33,010 --> 01:07:35,960
只有胜利之矛才可以击败库洛纳斯
Only the Spear of Trium can defeat Kronos.

700
01:07:36,110 --> 01:07:38,680
而那双握着长矛的手
And the hand that holds that spear will have to be...

701
01:07:38,850 --> 01:07:39,920
一定是你的
yours.

702
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:48,830
我们已经有了胜利之矛的两个部分
We have two pieces of the Spear of Trium.

703
01:07:50,130 --> 01:07:51,870
波塞冬的三叉戟
Poseidon's trident...

704
01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:54,740
哈迪斯的草叉
and Hades' pitchfork.

705
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:57,240
那么 我们还需要宙斯的闪电剑
Son, what we need is Zeus' thunderbolt.

706
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:58,940
就在阿瑞斯的背上背着
Which is an Ares' back.

707
01:08:01,970 --> 01:08:03,140
没错
Yep.

708
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:06,280
阿瑞斯
Ares.

709
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:08,980
阿瑞斯
Ares.

710
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:10,780
阿瑞斯
