00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:32,665
When future generations ask
what we fought for,

3
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:35,040
just tell them the story of Lidice.

4
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:37,874
Frank Knox - USA Navy Secretary
(1940 - 1944)

5
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:55,082
The priest was here today.
For some honey.

6
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,957
- What did he say? Did he damn you?
- No...

7
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:02,540
He said that war is coming.

8
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,165
We'll all be damned, hey?

9
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,332
Use the garden as an exit.

10
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:17,582
Enjoy the cake which,
in the name of the entire village

11
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:22,124
and the Lidice football club,
I am pleased to hand over.

12
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:25,790
But I would rather pass on this
honorary duty to our Deputy Mayor.

13
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,707
František...

14
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,415
Go on.

15
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:38,374
Who d'you think you are, you tramp?

16
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,499
Shut up, you squirt.

17
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,207
How dare you?

18
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:47,832
- You calling me a squirt, you wanker?
- Don't even talk to me!

19
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,249
You don't care they all know,
you enjoy it all.

20
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,165
Why be silent? Talk to me.

21
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,332
Get lost! Just go home!

22
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,082
Go home!

23
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,915
You bastard! I'll kill you!

24
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,957
Call the doctor!

25
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:29,707
- Dear Lord, let him rest in peace.
- And everlasting light be with him.

26
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:33,290
- Let him rest in holy peace.
- Amen.

27
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,582
Anežka, think of the Lord.

28
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:12,332
Heck, I imagined our last joint bit
of business slightly differently.

29
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,415
Lads, you are really off
to England?

30
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:19,207
What about you?
Won't change your mind?

31
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,749
Jaruš would murder me.

32
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,707
With a bit of luck,
others might do it quicker.

33
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,415
'least you'd fight for your country.

34
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,624
What about you, Karel?

35
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:41,499
Now when my brother is dead
and dad locked up

36
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:44,124
I can't leave mum on her own.

37
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,499
I passed him the knife.

38
00:06:55,791 --> 00:07:00,915
Eda was drunk and up for a fight,
he was oblivious of everything.

39
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:06,790
And František swiped at him
with that knife.

40
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,790
Does the accused wish to say
anything in his defence?

41
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:22,499
The accused, František Šíma,
is guilty

42
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:27,499
of stabbing his son, Eduard,
with death the consequence.

43
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:31,957
Thus, he is guilty of manslaughter
and is sentenced to hard labour

44
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,707
for the duration of four years.

45
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:07,124
- How is it going, gents?
- Finishing off, sir.

46
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:11,207
I pleaded for someone from
the trade, with a minor crime,

47
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:14,665
and you put in here a murderer!
A son-killer!

48
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,624
They brought in another one,

49
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,165
he killed two girls and
threw them into a pond.

50
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,999
Better than stabbing
your own son, isn't it?

51
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:27,207
- What's the other one like?
- Which other one?

52
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:31,124
Well, the one with the girls.
This one is really awful.

53
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:35,540
Stays mute, gapes... One doesn't know
what's running through his head.

54
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,665
You've failed to notice
you are in jail, haven't you?

55
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:42,332
- I've noticed.
- You think I'm giving you a choice?

56
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,499
You think you are
on a school outing?

57
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:49,207
You're banged up on a wing
with other hardened criminals,

58
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,790
so, behave accordingly.

59
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,499
It seems that there are
still worse crimes.

60
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,957
Petiška, Šíma, out!
Take your belongings.

61
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,665
This wing has to be cleared
for the Germans.

62
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:04,249
Run-of-the-mill, clearly
less dangerous offenders

63
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:07,665
such as murderers and the like,
are off to the B wing.

64
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:14,124
Here, they say, it will be
reserved for 'real rogues'.

65
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:18,207
Politicals.
Off we go. Come on.

66
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,040
- May I take the picture?
- No!

67
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,915
Prisoners, stop, stand still!

68
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,082
Rise!

69
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,665
Quickly! Quickly!

70
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,790
Prisoner 2037.

71
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,374
Your new colleague, Kowalski.

72
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,832
Petiška, you over there.

73
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:20,790
I hope you'll have no complaints
here about bad company.

74
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,332
I imagined it slightly differently.

75
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:28,415
Most things will be done
differently to what we imagined.

76
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:33,165
A local legend. Top-class forger.

77
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,999
Ripped off touts by the million.

78
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,665
But the jury
just couldn't work him out,

79
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:44,499
as he gave all the winnings
away to orphanages and poorhouses.

80
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,790
A right crackpot.

81
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:52,832
Not all of it.
I kept my working expenses.

82
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,207
How did they catch you?

83
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:04,165
One orphanage director was petrified
by the cash and she reported it.

84
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:11,499
- And whatever happened to you gents?
- Nothing much of interest.

85
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:15,415
I have a few safes to my name
and Síma here is a murderer.

86
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:21,207
Hmm, that is a somewhat alternative
method of applying God's teachings.

87
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:30,540
Sit down, Šíma. Sit!

88
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,374
No-one knows I am here.

89
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,874
Shouldn't have come.

90
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,249
František...

91
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:06,249
No hanky-panky, Šíma!
One more minute.

92
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,415
No newsprint.

93
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:29,332
So, I don't have to lug it back.

94
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,790
Please, read it.

95
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:57,665
A little bit late for that,
don't you think?

96
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,165
What about Karel?

97
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,915
Have you seen him?

98
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,540
I tend to stay out
of the way these days.

99
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:25,707
Zvolský said your old lady
is a right goer.

100
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:31,124
Crikey, you kill her kid
and she brings you eggs.

101
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:35,415
And a Bible.
You're a right weird family.

102
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,290
May I?

103
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:51,249
Here. Gospel according to St.John.
Chapter three, verse sixteen.

104
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:57,624
For God so loved the world,
that He gave His only begotten Son,

105
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:03,332
that whoever believes in Him should
not perish, but have eternal life.

106
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,999
You bastard!

107
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,124
I'll kill you!

108
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,624
What is it?

109
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:48,749
Can't expect a pure breed here.

110
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:58,124
Your mother's maiden name
was König, correct?

111
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:03,999
Your superiors weren't
as fortunate in their predecessors.

112
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:07,290
Supposedly you speak good German.

113
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:14,415
I'm offering you the job
in charge of the local gendarmes

114
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,874
with your pay being tripled.

115
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:21,082
May I think it over?

116
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:26,874
No. You are a strange nation.
You've no wish to help yourselves.

117
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:32,165
But I can have my own lads?

118
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:37,999
In fact, you must. We won't carry
out your police duties for you.

119
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,499
So, my congratulations.

120
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,915
Your first task will be to
gather all the church bells.

121
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:09,540
Your dad worked over there
tapping the hot metal.

122
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:13,749
I visited him a few times here.
As a small kid.

123
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,957
How is he doing in there?

124
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,582
Writes?

125
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,665
It's forbidden now.

126
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,999
Really? Strange. Jára,
who strangled his mother-in-law

127
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:28,290
keeps writing all the time,
mainly asking for grub and cigs.

128
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,332
Attention! Special announcement.

129
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:35,249
Today, in the early hours,
units of the German armed forces

130
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,082
have crossed the borders
of Bolshevik Russia.

131
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:44,124
Panzer divisions are easily cutting
through chaotic Russian defences...

132
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,165
That's for your mum.

133
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,707
What is it?

134
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:05,499
Doesn't have to know it's from me.

135
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:14,624
If you took care of the bees
you and your mum would have honey.

136
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,165
You enjoyed it as a small kid.

137
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:27,832
Karel!

138
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,957
You should pop by to see your dad.

139
00:18:55,875 --> 00:19:00,915
The priest asked whether
you'd help him again at Mass.

140
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:04,207
You used to enjoy playing the organ.

141
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,665
Seidl family
have different chickens.

142
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:15,957
No idea, they must have these too.

143
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:23,707
Shouldn't you be studying?

144
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,874
And shouldn't we go and visit dad?

145
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:38,665
I think we have enough
of other worries for now.

146
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:44,915
Who knows if they allow visits.
It's wartime. Other rules apply.

147
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:49,124
As a rule,
he still remains our dad.

148
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,540
Yippee!

149
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:08,790
Come closer, so we have
a memento of your three goals!

150
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:19,040
Come and stand down here.

151
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,332
Fine, a little further...

152
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:38,082
Nobody understands that,
in fact, I'm helping them.

153
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,165
If one of us didn't do it
we could be a lot worse off.

154
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,082
Thank you. Finished.

155
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,874
You think I get
a kick out of being here?

156
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:52,665
A public gathering demands
some official supervision.

157
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:56,665
I'm here because of them.
For them to have a good time.

158
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,582
You get it, don't you?

159
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:05,915
You're in the picture,
when they all gape at you like this.

160
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,790
Those two could make a couple.

161
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:18,415
With such shame I wouldn't
even stick my head out.

162
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:23,040
Marie! The chickens are laying well.

163
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:38,415
Horák and Stříbrný have legged it,
now you have a bigger range to fill.

164
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:06,249
- Will you dance with me?
- Now that you've finished playing?

165
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:13,332
The girls are waiting for me.

166
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,457
Go on then, don't linger.

167
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:22,457
I have to get a little more drunk.

168
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:26,749
Then I will ask you again.

169
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:33,749
No more for you.

170
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,915
When I get sozzled
I don't feel so shy.

171
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:43,915
But, there again I just
jabber nonsense then.

172
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:48,957
Be glad. You'd be married
with a kid like me.

173
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,165
Ungrateful louts!

174
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:56,499
You hate me too, don't you?

175
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:00,915
- We're just musicians.
- We just feel ashamed for you.

176
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:06,290
And a little bit scared of you.
Just a bit...

177
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:14,207
Lads, you know how much I'm afraid?

178
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:20,457
Nothing left to joke about.

179
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:36,332
The Leader and Reich Chancellor
has appointed, to replace the ill

180
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,999
Reich Protector,
Konstantin von Neurath,

181
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:43,915
in the post of Reich Protector,
SS-Obegruppenführer Heydrich.

182
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:48,082
The Acting Reich Protector
has taken up his post.

183
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:53,999
At Prague Castle he was welcomed
by the State Secretary, K.H. Frank.

184
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:57,457
Thereafter, the Acting
Reich Protector carried out

185
00:23:57,625 --> 00:24:01,415
an inspection of army,
SS armed units and police units.

186
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,665
Which bugger is responsible?
You want to get us all locked up?

187
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,415
Look... that one on the left.

188
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:25,999
She's beautiful, hey?

189
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:39,040
Come on, follow them.

190
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,415
Just you watch.

191
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:58,790
Girls, can I talk
to you for a minute?

192
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,415
I need you to help
me out with something.

193
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:07,290
It's simple.
A kind of a secret errand.

194
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:11,040
I need you to sort
something out in Lidice.

195
00:25:12,416 --> 00:25:17,332
To hand over this button.
But no-one must find out.

196
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:23,040
Give it to the Horák family,
the farmstead behind the church.

197
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:26,915
Tell them that Pepík
is all right, OK?

198
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:29,790
If it's that important, than fine.

199
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:37,374
Don't look over there.
My mate is passing on a signal.

200
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:39,665
See you.

201
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,832
Come on, let's go. Don't stare.

202
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:47,957
She'll fall for this, you'll see...
Let's be off.

203
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:25,165
- Good afternoon. Horák family?
- That's us.

204
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:31,582
I have a message for you.
I'm just the go-between but...

205
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,082
I'm supposed to give you this

206
00:26:35,666 --> 00:26:38,499
and tell you
that Pepík is all right.

207
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:52,624
Thank you. Let them pass on
to Pepík in England...

208
00:26:56,541 --> 00:26:58,915
...my sweet child...

209
00:26:59,208 --> 00:27:03,332
tell him that we are fine
and are very proud of him.

210
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,582
- Dad, come here.
- What's going on?

211
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:09,540
Here, Miss...

212
00:27:11,916 --> 00:27:13,999
Pepík is well.

213
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,790
Come on.

214
00:27:20,958 --> 00:27:23,332
- We thank you.
- Thank you, Miss.

215
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:27,082
- No need for thanks.
- Oh, yes there is.

216
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:34,999
CERTAIN VICTORY OF
THE THIRD REICH IS WITHIN REACH

217
00:27:35,166 --> 00:27:38,624
On the orders of the newly
appointed Reich Protector Heydrich

218
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:42,749
the following Czech patriots
have been executed...

219
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:52,415
Sir, does the radio really
have to be kept with us?

220
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:54,415
If they find out...

221
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:58,082
Petiška, easy does it.

222
00:27:58,291 --> 00:28:02,040
Šíma, stand by the door.
If anyone comes, scream.

223
00:28:09,958 --> 00:28:11,165
Attention!

224
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:18,540
What are you screeching for?
Have you gone mad?

225
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:21,124
Why aren't you working?

226
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:25,582
- Army habits. Officer is coming...
- What officer?

227
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:30,082
What's this?

228
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,707
Heck... next.

229
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:36,749
Terrible. We've a mistake here.

230
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:41,874
It's written that they've been
executed but it's got...

231
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:44,832
Tomorrow's date.

232
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,540
That's correct.

233
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:50,832
Fuck me! They know it?

234
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,290
You'd want to know?

235
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:05,832
Here it is.

236
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:11,290
- Are we waiting for anybody else?
- No.

237
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,957
We have a small job to do.

238
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:17,207
Helena, will you help me?

239
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:20,415
Helena's shoes aren't much cop.
I'm coming up.

240
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,874
What are they doing up there?

241
00:29:28,791 --> 00:29:31,374
- Drawing a map.
- Such beauty.

242
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:34,749
Spread it out.

243
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:40,832
- Is that because of the drops?
- Sure.

244
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:45,957
We should include
the power lines then.

245
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:50,499
Why did you need us?

246
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,207
So we didn't stand out
so much in the field.

247
00:29:58,458 --> 00:30:00,165
Somebody is coming.

248
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,165
In a uniform.

249
00:30:11,583 --> 00:30:14,207
- Vlček...
- We can handle it.

250
00:30:15,666 --> 00:30:18,832
Damn it, boys,
what are you doing here?

251
00:30:20,666 --> 00:30:24,290
What stupid idea is it running
around the woods these days?

252
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:27,582
They're looking for
the parachutists everywhere.

253
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:31,915
I haven't seen a thing.

254
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:50,082
- They believed us!
- Hmm.

255
00:30:53,416 --> 00:30:56,874
- What's up with her?
- She can't help it.

256
00:30:58,375 --> 00:31:02,790
If you ever need anything
just shout. I'll gladly help.

257
00:31:02,958 --> 00:31:06,207
Just leave a note
at the factory gate.

258
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,457
Bye.

259
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,874
Helena, wait!

260
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:20,624
What should I have done?
The other one is a good'un too.

261
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:26,332
But Anička is something special.
Not even afraid of the devil, hey?

262
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:29,415
Hang on!

263
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:46,249
It's late.
You've two minutes.

264
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:55,207
You look different.

265
00:31:57,291 --> 00:31:58,874
You too.

266
00:32:01,208 --> 00:32:03,040
How goes it at home?

267
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:15,165
The lads from work send you this.
They send their greetings.

268
00:32:15,958 --> 00:32:17,665
You've talked to them?

269
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:21,957
I talk to them every day now.

270
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:36,082
The lads from school are being sent
to Germany. Cash comes in useful too.

271
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,707
Mum has her sewing but...

272
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:42,540
Karel, I've been thinking.

273
00:32:44,958 --> 00:32:48,540
Sell my bike.
You can use mum's old one.

274
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:53,665
And buy her a sewing machine.
A decent one.

275
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:57,832
You'll need the bike. Then...

276
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,457
I'll buy another one.
A better one. For you as well.

277
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,749
Finish.

278
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:12,332
- What about mum?
- Nothing new.

279
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:17,957
- Thank you for the cigarettes.
- Let's go, Síma.

280
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:20,915
If you are ever passing again...

281
00:33:49,083 --> 00:33:50,415
Go!

282
00:33:58,375 --> 00:34:00,915
No Bible and eggs today.

283
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,249
Thank you.

284
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:10,707
May I have two?

285
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:26,915
They're from my son.

286
00:34:33,708 --> 00:34:35,832
You've got another one?

287
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,915
I have another one.

288
00:34:47,916 --> 00:34:51,290
You bastard! I'll kill you!

289
00:35:32,166 --> 00:35:39,499
Oh my heart searches
for You for eternity.

290
00:35:40,541 --> 00:35:48,624
Oh, Jesus of mine,

291
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:57,249
in poverty and anguish
stand by me evermore.

292
00:36:00,416 --> 00:36:03,624
I've talked to the Mayor.

293
00:36:04,708 --> 00:36:09,207
It's been time enough
to appeal to the court.

294
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:16,582
But the entire committee has
to sign it as well as your mother.

295
00:36:17,666 --> 00:36:20,082
And, of course, him too.

296
00:36:21,916 --> 00:36:26,457
Discuss it with mother.
It's up to the two of you.

297
00:36:32,666 --> 00:36:34,165
Well then?

298
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:43,374
I have to think it through,
it's difficult enough as it is.

299
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:51,124
Gusta said that Vlček saw you
in the woods with some girls.

300
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:00,540
Nothing wrong with that.

301
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:05,957
Who are they?

302
00:37:08,958 --> 00:37:12,165
Just girls. From the factory.

303
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:15,915
Gusta also said
that you wanted him

304
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:20,665
to ask around whether anyone
wanted to buy your dad's bike.

305
00:37:25,416 --> 00:37:28,665
And you want to buy
a sewing machine.

306
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:34,040
What will you be sewing?

307
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,915
Have you been to see him already?

308
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:02,790
If you ever go again
take this for him.

309
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:09,124
Give me time.
I have to mull it over.

310
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:29,749
Didn't want to but my wifey screamed
that she didn't want to be a widow.

311
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:33,374
Forced my father-in-law's gear on
and pushed me out of the house.

312
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,957
I'm curious as to how well
that Heydrich can play.

313
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:39,957
- Seen him on pictures and executions.
- I didn't know he was a musician.

314
00:39:33,916 --> 00:39:37,124
I hope the Czech Quartet didn't mind

315
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:40,832
that I substituted for their
first string tonight.

316
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:45,249
I am pleased to be able
to welcome you at Prague Castle -

317
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:49,249
a symbol of everything that
throughout history links us.

318
00:39:50,041 --> 00:39:53,790
My aim is to ensure
this land becomes

319
00:39:53,958 --> 00:40:00,040
a prosperous and effective part
of our Great Reich.

320
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:04,499
And you are the ones

321
00:40:05,375 --> 00:40:08,790
who are suitable for such a task.

322
00:40:32,708 --> 00:40:35,582
What's it like playing with him?

323
00:40:37,791 --> 00:40:40,957
He is an excellent violinist.

324
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:47,040
Leave them be. They're scared.

325
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:51,749
Where d'you think the fourth one is?
On holiday by the sea?

326
00:40:55,125 --> 00:41:00,249
There was lots of food
and then they bussed us to a hotel.

327
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:04,415
And on the Sunday we all had
tickets to a football match.

328
00:41:04,583 --> 00:41:08,915
You have to be prudent, Karel.
These are strange times.

329
00:41:11,875 --> 00:41:13,374
What about mother?

330
00:41:29,125 --> 00:41:32,207
I am supposed
to pass on her greetings.

331
00:41:56,708 --> 00:41:59,207
I spoke to the priest.

332
00:41:59,375 --> 00:42:03,290
Seems they could put together
an appeal to reduce the sentence.

333
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:05,749
The committee would sign it.

334
00:42:06,208 --> 00:42:08,040
And mother?

335
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:12,999
She'd have to sign it too.

336
00:42:15,416 --> 00:42:17,457
Have you sold the bike?

337
00:42:18,916 --> 00:42:20,332
Yep.

338
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:27,582
That's good.

339
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:38,540
They couldn't get hold
of that colour you wanted.

340
00:42:38,875 --> 00:42:41,374
Supposedly this one is good as well.

341
00:42:43,416 --> 00:42:45,457
You have five to play with.

342
00:42:45,625 --> 00:42:48,957
Speed is of the essence, so,
you'll go off sick tomorrow.

343
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:52,165
Your mates must handle
things without you.

344
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:04,915
Stern,

345
00:43:08,416 --> 00:43:09,915
Wagner,

346
00:43:11,291 --> 00:43:12,915
Fisher.

347
00:43:13,083 --> 00:43:17,290
I'm really curious how much
that bleeder gets for each one.

348
00:43:17,458 --> 00:43:20,332
Be glad you don't need
such a passport.

349
00:43:20,791 --> 00:43:23,082
I would never have imagined

350
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:28,915
that one can carry out such
heavenly-minded work in a prison.

351
00:43:31,666 --> 00:43:35,749
The ways of the Lord are mysterious.

352
00:43:38,208 --> 00:43:41,957
Your sonnie didn't
manage a few cigs today?

353
00:43:43,083 --> 00:43:46,874
Well, at least the honey.
Honey is undoubtedly good.

354
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,457
Does young'un take care of the bees?

355
00:43:50,916 --> 00:43:52,582
I hope not.

356
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:10,040
It's agreed,
we can't leave them just like that.

357
00:44:10,458 --> 00:44:12,582
I didn't want to agree anything.

358
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:17,082
You can't let them down now.
The other is also worth it.

359
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,582
See, she's on her own.
She is waiting for you.

360
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:34,249
- Maybe the other one is sick.
- I'm not going, I'd be out of place.

361
00:44:41,458 --> 00:44:44,165
- Most kind of you to come, Anička.
- Good afternoon.

362
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:48,290
Don't be angry at Helena,
she'd want to help too,

363
00:44:48,583 --> 00:44:53,832
most of her family are incarcerated
in Terezín already. She's afraid.

364
00:44:56,666 --> 00:44:58,374
Come with me.

365
00:45:09,041 --> 00:45:12,040
It's peaceful here and I like it.

366
00:45:15,458 --> 00:45:17,332
This is for you.

367
00:45:18,166 --> 00:45:19,832
What is it?

368
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:24,082
How did you lug it here
by yourself? What's in it?

369
00:45:25,583 --> 00:45:30,749
I though it might come in handy
for your friends.

370
00:45:32,416 --> 00:45:34,207
Auntie had a piglet killed,

371
00:45:34,375 --> 00:45:38,457
and I told her I'd send
it to my dad in a labour camp.

372
00:45:42,416 --> 00:45:45,707
You're sweet but you've got
enough troubles of your own.

373
00:45:45,875 --> 00:45:49,749
I'll just take it home for you
and you send it to your dad.

374
00:45:51,458 --> 00:45:53,790
Father died six months ago.

375
00:45:57,166 --> 00:45:58,957
But my aunt is in the dark.

376
00:46:00,083 --> 00:46:04,415
Mum wrote to me not to tell
her as she has a weak heart.

377
00:46:06,583 --> 00:46:07,874
Anička...

378
00:46:08,041 --> 00:46:12,082
I doubt her heart is likely
to get stronger to tell her later.

379
00:46:19,708 --> 00:46:21,290
Sorry...

380
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,749
I don't want to weep.
I'm silly.

381
00:46:26,333 --> 00:46:30,249
Damn, instead of being of some
use to you I'm whimpering here.

382
00:46:30,416 --> 00:46:33,374
You don't know
how much you've helped.

383
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:36,624
I didn't know your family
was so troubled.

384
00:46:37,208 --> 00:46:39,790
I wouldn't have got you involved.

385
00:46:39,958 --> 00:46:44,957
I'm terribly glad I can do something.
You can't imagine how much.

386
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:49,082
For that very reason -
everybody has gone.

387
00:46:49,458 --> 00:46:53,374
In this way I don't have
to be afraid for anybody else.

388
00:46:53,666 --> 00:46:56,874
You have to be afraid.
For yourself.

389
00:47:27,875 --> 00:47:31,790
The day before yesterday it seems
they landed near the deer enclosure.

390
00:47:31,958 --> 00:47:34,540
Such news does
the rounds all the time.

391
00:47:34,708 --> 00:47:39,290
If it was true the forest would be
full of parachutists.

392
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:44,332
Take that for your mum.

393
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:46,499
What is it?

394
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:57,915
- Are you kidding?
- It's from Anička.

395
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:00,582
Why is she sending my mum meat?

396
00:48:02,458 --> 00:48:04,832
Because we're arseholes.

397
00:48:11,875 --> 00:48:15,582
- Should have told her the truth.
- Suddenly you're a brainbox.

398
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:19,665
Drink up, gents.
Closing time, it's late.

399
00:48:19,833 --> 00:48:21,374
Go home!

400
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:26,540
How would I look? I'd rather be
a liar and she feels good about it.

401
00:48:26,708 --> 00:48:29,832
- On whose behalf did I lie to her?
- Well...

402
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,540
Is it my fault that you're unable
to find yourself a woman?

403
00:48:33,708 --> 00:48:38,249
It's so unfair.
What do you need another girl for?

404
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:40,915
You have everything.

405
00:48:41,875 --> 00:48:44,832
The thing is, we really should
start doing something!

406
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,874
That girl is right! She has guts!

407
00:48:49,625 --> 00:48:53,540
And she has such minute hands.

408
00:48:57,875 --> 00:49:01,999
Where is that damned resistance?
I swear I want to help them.

409
00:49:02,333 --> 00:49:05,040
I also want to be a parachutist.

410
00:49:06,458 --> 00:49:11,374
You sit here and do bugger all!
And war's on!

411
00:50:43,125 --> 00:50:55,790
Assassination of Heydrich!

412
00:51:03,041 --> 00:51:04,915
Attention! Attention!

413
00:51:05,083 --> 00:51:09,040
The public is requested to help
in clearing up the assassination

414
00:51:09,208 --> 00:51:14,624
of the Acting Reich Protector,
SS-Obergruppenführer Heydrich,

415
00:51:14,791 --> 00:51:21,999
which was carried out on the
morning of 27. May 1942 in Prague.

416
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:26,540
Any circumstances, even if seemingly
unimportant to the individual,

417
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:29,082
could be of great value
to the police.

418
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:46,207
PUBLIC NOTICE

419
00:52:13,458 --> 00:52:16,207
I'll pay for the trip
but you must go there.

420
00:52:17,625 --> 00:52:23,832
This isn't the right time. There'll
be other problems now to deal with.

421
00:52:25,291 --> 00:52:26,624
Exactly.

422
00:52:28,458 --> 00:52:30,040
And you promised.

423
00:52:37,875 --> 00:52:42,457
We pray for our merciful God
to accept into his Kingdom

424
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,332
our recently executed
brothers and sisters.

425
00:52:51,083 --> 00:52:52,707
Karel Benda,

426
00:52:53,708 --> 00:52:55,832
Dr. Max Groch,

427
00:52:57,166 --> 00:52:59,207
Manuel Groff,

428
00:52:59,916 --> 00:53:01,749
Dr. Jan Hruška,

429
00:53:02,541 --> 00:53:04,374
Jaroslav Rákos,

430
00:53:04,791 --> 00:53:06,499
Ladislav Šulc,

431
00:53:07,375 --> 00:53:09,165
Václav Tollinger,

432
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:11,165
Josef Vyskočil.

433
00:53:15,833 --> 00:53:20,082
...sweeping roundups have been
extended to the countryside.

434
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:24,290
Thousands of people have been held,
hundreds of them executed.

435
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:27,415
Frenzied efforts by SS units...

436
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:30,499
Christ, turn it off!
Have you gone stark raving mad?!

437
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:32,915
Where do you think you are?

438
00:53:33,583 --> 00:53:37,832
- This has to be destroyed.
- It's your radio.

439
00:53:49,208 --> 00:53:51,874
You just don't get it, do you?

440
00:53:52,166 --> 00:53:56,374
Everything will be different now.
Everywhere and everything.

441
00:53:56,541 --> 00:54:00,707
A minor pretext will suffice, even
some idiocy, and we're all dead!

442
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:16,457
According to all these reports
local woods are full of parachutists.

443
00:54:18,541 --> 00:54:20,415
Where are you keeping them then?

444
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:25,374
I rather think the region
is full of informers.

445
00:54:25,541 --> 00:54:28,624
You don't want to catch anybody!

446
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:32,915
But we must get someone!
Get it! We must!

447
00:54:35,875 --> 00:54:39,915
You can just pray that one of these
informers has something of value,

448
00:54:40,083 --> 00:54:43,332
otherwise, Vlček,
it will be you that will hang.

449
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:47,165
Get out.

450
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,415
Šíma.

451
00:55:06,916 --> 00:55:08,707
Lord be blessed.

452
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:21,040
We have written that during wartime
we need a blacksmith.

453
00:55:21,375 --> 00:55:24,582
Old Štrébl died last spring.

454
00:55:24,791 --> 00:55:30,249
The whole committee signed it,
just your signature is missing.

455
00:55:38,625 --> 00:55:41,082
Your wife sends you this.

456
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:45,749
If it weren't for Anežka
none would lift a finger for you.

457
00:55:45,916 --> 00:55:49,999
Those signatures don't mean
they've forgiven you,

458
00:55:50,166 --> 00:55:54,665
they just mean they feel sorry
for Anežka and Karel.

459
00:55:55,208 --> 00:55:57,707
If it was up to me I'd...

460
00:56:03,708 --> 00:56:05,457
Give Anežka this.

461
00:56:09,041 --> 00:56:11,249
I know that it's farcical.

462
00:56:11,666 --> 00:56:17,165
What do I need a wedding outfit for?
It will only lie waste in a wardrobe.

463
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:23,624
But I told my mum in Kladno that
it's been complete for a long while,

464
00:56:23,791 --> 00:56:28,290
now, with the war on, she wants
to keep it safe in her home.

465
00:56:28,541 --> 00:56:31,040
It will come in handy one day.

466
00:56:33,833 --> 00:56:35,165
Karel?

467
00:56:38,333 --> 00:56:40,540
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

468
00:56:41,083 --> 00:56:45,332
I visited your husband.
And I've sent off the petition.

469
00:56:46,791 --> 00:56:50,707
He sends you this.
And what are you doing here?

470
00:56:51,666 --> 00:56:53,707
There is a curfew on!

471
00:56:55,541 --> 00:56:57,749
Where is Karel?

472
00:57:02,708 --> 00:57:05,999
Excuse me, could I leave
a letter here with you?

473
00:57:07,708 --> 00:57:09,207
What is it about?

474
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:12,915
It's for Anička Maruščáková.
It's important.

475
00:57:13,625 --> 00:57:15,790
Thank you. Goodbye.

476
00:57:17,625 --> 00:57:21,832
- You're a right swine.
- Do I write I'm married with a kid?

477
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,207
In order that I remain
heroically truthful

478
00:57:24,375 --> 00:57:28,332
and she thinks she's been led up
a garden path by a married bloke?

479
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:33,124
You don't know her, so, keep your
trap shut. It's your fault anyway.

480
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:01,874
- Kowalski, take your shoes!
- What's happening?

481
00:58:02,041 --> 00:58:05,165
You morons, the war's on,
that's what!

482
00:58:10,375 --> 00:58:12,082
Get a move on!

483
00:58:19,083 --> 00:58:23,332
Go.

484
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:36,415
- Is that all? Is it?
- Yeah.

485
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,749
You have no need to fear.
They'll only spoil you.

486
00:58:45,416 --> 00:58:49,290
They asked for you.
If you survive, let us know.

487
00:58:51,541 --> 00:58:53,749
Look, Kowalski,
I have no wish to give advice,

488
00:58:53,916 --> 00:58:56,165
but if you're really such a wizard

489
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:59,999
you could forge those German
passports a bit fraudulently,

490
00:59:00,166 --> 00:59:04,624
so the Germans don't find out but,
meantime, it would be discovered

491
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:07,415
on the border crossing
when they're trying to flee.

492
00:59:07,583 --> 00:59:10,707
- Then you'll be innocent again.
- Which one?

493
00:59:12,791 --> 00:59:14,540
Thank you.

494
00:59:14,916 --> 00:59:19,457
I don't think, though,
I will be in need of it anymore.

495
00:59:21,458 --> 00:59:26,540
I believe in God, I just
plainly don't understand Him.

496
00:59:28,708 --> 00:59:33,249
We think we know what role
we are playing in it all.

497
00:59:37,708 --> 00:59:39,540
Thank you...

498
00:59:41,958 --> 00:59:43,249
Thanks.

499
00:59:56,833 --> 01:00:00,249
In the end, he'll be
better off than the rest of us.

500
01:00:00,416 --> 01:00:02,374
You know nought, so keep it shut.

501
01:00:12,833 --> 01:00:18,624
Hey! Tell Maruščáková to pop in
afterwards, she has a letter here.

502
01:00:18,791 --> 01:00:21,457
Anička is ill,
she won't be in today.

503
01:00:48,958 --> 01:00:52,124
Dear Anička, forgive me for
writing to you so belatedly.

504
01:00:52,291 --> 01:00:55,999
Perhaps you will understand as
you know I have work and worries.

505
01:00:56,166 --> 01:00:58,290
What I needed to do I have done.

506
01:00:58,458 --> 01:01:01,165
On that fateful day
I slept in a barn.

507
01:01:01,333 --> 01:01:05,915
I am well. We'll see each other
this week and then no more.

508
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:11,165
What childish prattle, Vlček?
It's absolutely clear.

509
01:01:11,333 --> 01:01:14,499
We've waited for this for ages!

510
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,415
Very well...

511
01:01:18,333 --> 01:01:21,165
Vlček, this is crystal clear.

512
01:01:32,166 --> 01:01:34,165
Get up! Outside!

513
01:01:37,416 --> 01:01:38,832
Out!

514
01:01:57,416 --> 01:02:00,915
I don't believe a word of it.

515
01:02:01,791 --> 01:02:05,999
You trying to tell me
that you're seeing a bloke

516
01:02:06,166 --> 01:02:09,707
and don't even know his name
and where he's from?

517
01:02:11,125 --> 01:02:12,874
I don't know.

518
01:02:20,708 --> 01:02:22,582
Why, Vlček?

519
01:02:23,291 --> 01:02:26,707
Why didn't you tell me
you saw them in the woods?

520
01:02:26,875 --> 01:02:29,540
Why didn't you report it
there and then?

521
01:02:29,708 --> 01:02:32,832
Because he didn't write it.

522
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:38,415
He is no resistance fighter,
more of a trumpet player and letch.

523
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:46,415
His name, Vlček.

524
01:02:54,750 --> 01:03:00,499
Where are you taking him?

525
01:03:03,875 --> 01:03:08,999
Call dad they are most likely
dragging me off to Kladno.

526
01:03:10,166 --> 01:03:13,040
- Take care of yourself!
- Vašek!

527
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:16,415
Wait!

528
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:19,749
Vašek!

529
01:03:29,208 --> 01:03:33,332
So, you say you were just
taking her for a ride?

530
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:36,124
Is that your cock-and-bull story?

531
01:03:36,291 --> 01:03:38,415
It's the truth.

532
01:03:39,083 --> 01:03:40,415
Hold.

533
01:03:43,583 --> 01:03:45,040
No!

534
01:03:46,625 --> 01:03:50,082
Is it the truth?
Is it the truth then?

535
01:03:53,583 --> 01:03:56,832
We don't know what he told you

536
01:03:58,541 --> 01:04:01,124
but if you know anything...

537
01:04:09,541 --> 01:04:14,332
I just had to pass on a message
in Lidice to the Horák family.

538
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:16,290
Nothing else.

539
01:04:20,375 --> 01:04:22,457
Horáks from Lidice...

540
01:04:49,708 --> 01:04:53,165
Both fighting abroad.
Horák and Stříbrný.

541
01:04:53,916 --> 01:04:56,374
So, we have a link to England.

542
01:04:57,125 --> 01:05:00,165
But no-one saw
Horák or Stříbrný here.

543
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:03,415
No other evidence but the letter?

544
01:05:03,625 --> 01:05:08,374
We have nothing concrete,
so, we have to wait again.

545
01:05:08,541 --> 01:05:11,707
But we can't wait any longer.
You understand?

546
01:05:11,875 --> 01:05:14,790
We at least need some proof.

547
01:05:18,375 --> 01:05:20,374
Some proof, you say?

548
01:05:23,541 --> 01:05:25,540
What about a transmitter?

549
01:05:54,458 --> 01:05:57,915
We'll just take a look around.
Just a routine check.

550
01:06:48,583 --> 01:06:51,165
Will it run in the cinemas?

551
01:06:54,625 --> 01:06:57,540
Don't you fancy filming us too?

552
01:07:22,583 --> 01:07:24,415
Is it an order?

553
01:07:26,458 --> 01:07:30,415
What do you think?
I'm supposed to beg you?

554
01:07:31,916 --> 01:07:36,124
I understand your feelings.
You know them all personally.

555
01:07:36,291 --> 01:07:39,457
But have no worries,
your area of responsibility

556
01:07:39,625 --> 01:07:44,207
will be to round up and account
for the property and livestock.

557
01:07:44,791 --> 01:07:47,332
I know it is unpleasant

558
01:07:47,916 --> 01:07:52,249
but it has certain big advantages.

559
01:07:53,416 --> 01:07:58,290
In fact, it was lucky the transmitter
was fixed on to this area.

560
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:03,374
The ten million crowns promised
for the capture of the culprits

561
01:08:03,541 --> 01:08:06,290
has to be divided up somehow.

562
01:08:10,958 --> 01:08:13,374
If I refuse?

563
01:08:15,083 --> 01:08:17,457
I will be disappointed...

564
01:08:18,166 --> 01:08:20,249
And you will be dead.

565
01:08:59,250 --> 01:09:02,124
Růžena, straight in here!

566
01:09:26,791 --> 01:09:29,832
- Anežka, is Karel home with you?
- No.

567
01:09:31,833 --> 01:09:34,332
You better come to my place.

568
01:10:05,708 --> 01:10:10,165
The army is in the field behind
the village! Masses of them!

569
01:10:31,625 --> 01:10:33,915
Stop! Military manoeuvres!

570
01:10:34,083 --> 01:10:37,707
If you are local you can
carry on to the village.

571
01:10:38,291 --> 01:10:41,957
Lads, you can go in
but they won't let you out again.

572
01:10:43,375 --> 01:10:48,082
What's all this nonsense?
We have wives and children there.

573
01:10:56,791 --> 01:10:59,790
But why are there
so many of them?

574
01:11:00,375 --> 01:11:02,874
That's nonsense, this...

575
01:11:03,041 --> 01:11:06,499
Better disperse!
It will be dark soon.

576
01:11:12,166 --> 01:11:14,082
Let them pass!

577
01:11:44,208 --> 01:11:45,582
Thank you.

578
01:12:05,041 --> 01:12:06,207
Mayor,

579
01:12:06,375 --> 01:12:09,790
pack your valuables and clothing
for two days. And a blanket.

580
01:12:09,958 --> 01:12:12,624
You have five minutes.
Then in front of the house.

581
01:12:29,875 --> 01:12:34,124
Put the field kitchen right next
to the farm so it's close at hand.

582
01:12:34,291 --> 01:12:38,624
When Geschke and Böhme arrive
bring them straight to me.

583
01:12:48,041 --> 01:12:50,290
Open up! Hurry!

584
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:00,582
What is this here?

585
01:13:05,625 --> 01:13:06,957
Here.

586
01:13:22,125 --> 01:13:24,374
Get moving!

587
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:39,290
Go home and get a few things.

588
01:13:39,458 --> 01:13:42,707
Karel!
Better if you use the garden.

589
01:13:51,458 --> 01:13:55,290
Pack up your valuables,
a blanket and a change of clothing.

590
01:13:55,458 --> 01:13:57,790
One piece of baggage and out!

591
01:14:25,208 --> 01:14:29,874
Let her go. She only works here.
She is from Kladno.

592
01:14:30,791 --> 01:14:35,207
Your permanent address along with
your parents are Kladno. Tonička!

593
01:14:36,333 --> 01:14:40,707
I am going with him. You think
I'm just going to leave him here?

594
01:14:40,875 --> 01:14:42,582
Move!

595
01:15:02,958 --> 01:15:04,415
Attention!

596
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:44,499
- You can't take me with you.
- He's only sixteen!

597
01:15:44,666 --> 01:15:49,040
- Fifteen is the limit.
- I was fifteen too, hey Father?

598
01:15:54,458 --> 01:15:57,915
We have everything recorded,
of course.

599
01:16:03,208 --> 01:16:06,957
The inhabitants are rather confused

600
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:10,749
and thus far haven't resisted.

601
01:16:10,916 --> 01:16:15,290
The only organisational problems
have been with the animals.

602
01:16:16,708 --> 01:16:22,082
Have you eaten? May I invite
you to an excellent goulash.

603
01:16:36,375 --> 01:16:38,999
We'll send them their priest.

604
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:43,582
That always raises morale
and brings a sense of security.

605
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:45,874
We'll pick him up later.

606
01:16:46,833 --> 01:16:48,249
Come here.

607
01:16:48,916 --> 01:16:52,249
Put that blue pram aside for me.

608
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:04,207
Karel!

609
01:17:35,208 --> 01:17:37,374
Let's save our strength.

610
01:17:37,541 --> 01:17:40,915
We must, at least,
calm down the children.

611
01:17:41,083 --> 01:17:45,499
It's because of the paras.
It'll all be over by morning.

612
01:17:45,666 --> 01:17:47,207
You'll see.

613
01:20:19,666 --> 01:20:21,249
Let's pray.

614
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:25,957
Our Father in heaven,

615
01:20:26,125 --> 01:20:30,082
hallowed be Your name,
Your kingdom come,

616
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:33,249
Your will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

617
01:20:33,416 --> 01:20:36,957
Give us today our daily bread
and forgive our trespasses

618
01:20:37,125 --> 01:20:40,165
as we forgive those
who trespass against us,

619
01:20:40,333 --> 01:20:44,040
subject us not to the trial,
but deliver us from evil,

620
01:20:44,208 --> 01:20:49,415
for thine is Your kingdom,
and the power and the glory. Amen.

621
01:24:09,541 --> 01:24:11,707
All finished, sir.

622
01:24:12,583 --> 01:24:17,332
Šíma, what's all the lazing about?
Get going, you have your duties!

623
01:24:17,541 --> 01:24:20,999
- Petiška's turn today.
- Stop prattling and get lost!

624
01:24:29,541 --> 01:24:33,457
Petiška, we must finish this
before he gets back.

625
01:24:33,625 --> 01:24:34,957
Sure.

626
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:38,165
Start composing it.

627
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:42,040
What is it?

628
01:24:45,583 --> 01:24:47,290
He's from Lidice.

629
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:53,124
Isn't this being over-sensitive?
He killed one lad himself.

630
01:24:53,666 --> 01:24:55,540
He'll find out anyway.

631
01:24:55,916 --> 01:24:58,915
But I don't have to be
within earshot.

632
01:25:00,083 --> 01:25:04,332
No mention of women and kids,
perhaps his old lady survived.

633
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:06,999
Better just get on with it.

634
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:35,874
Sister, we've been here two days.
The children have to eat.

635
01:25:36,125 --> 01:25:39,832
- Get back to your place!
- What do you intend to do with us?

636
01:25:54,916 --> 01:25:58,915
Just a formal examination.
Don't worry. Come on.

637
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:01,749
They'll be back in a short while.

638
01:26:06,083 --> 01:26:07,915
These are the last ones?

639
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,832
- What's your name?
- Ota Veselý.

640
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,540
Otto. A lovely name.
We'll look...

641
01:26:17,166 --> 01:26:18,124
Two.

642
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:22,040
Six.

643
01:26:23,916 --> 01:26:25,457
Three.

644
01:26:26,625 --> 01:26:28,249
One A.

645
01:26:28,708 --> 01:26:31,749
This one's fine.
Thanks, Otto.

646
01:26:32,458 --> 01:26:33,915
Next one.

647
01:26:50,166 --> 01:26:52,540
Shouldn't have believed him.

648
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:57,582
Who knows what he did with the
appeal. And with that letter too.

649
01:26:57,833 --> 01:27:01,415
He is a priest.
He can't do things like lie.

650
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:05,290
Hmm, but if he gave her the letter
why did she not reply?

651
01:27:05,666 --> 01:27:08,665
Karel, too, hasn't showed up since.

652
01:27:09,250 --> 01:27:14,707
Everything is more difficult.
The post, buses not running...

653
01:27:17,125 --> 01:27:20,582
- Look, you're out soon.
- I could be home already.

654
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:23,082
Seems they've cold-shouldered me.

655
01:27:23,250 --> 01:27:26,874
It might be a good idea to
give them the cold shoulder too.

656
01:27:27,041 --> 01:27:30,790
Go somewhere else,
make a new start for yourself.

657
01:27:30,958 --> 01:27:33,040
That's barmy, isn't it?

658
01:27:33,625 --> 01:27:35,290
Agh! Shit...

659
01:27:35,916 --> 01:27:39,874
Sir, we need some gloves.
My fingers are ripped apart.

660
01:27:40,041 --> 01:27:42,665
Petiška, stop all that balderdash.

661
01:27:42,833 --> 01:27:45,874
Just be glad you're on this
side of the fence.

662
01:27:46,041 --> 01:27:50,332
In comparison to what will happen
there this side is a Garden of Eden.

663
01:28:12,166 --> 01:28:16,999
Every child under sixteen
years of age must have a tag.

664
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,707
Calm down,
There is no need to panic.

665
01:28:22,916 --> 01:28:24,999
It's for your own good!

666
01:28:25,916 --> 01:28:29,790
You will be transported
to a labour camp.

667
01:28:30,250 --> 01:28:34,582
For their greater comfort children
will go ahead of you by bus.

668
01:28:35,333 --> 01:28:40,540
You have my word of honour that
you'll meet up in good shape soon.

669
01:28:44,625 --> 01:28:47,040
Please no! No!

670
01:28:49,208 --> 01:28:52,624
It will be better for you.
Růženka, please.

671
01:28:52,958 --> 01:28:56,874
Marie, don't put her down,
don't trust them.

672
01:28:59,750 --> 01:29:03,082
- How old is she?
- Sixteen-and-a-half.

673
01:30:30,041 --> 01:30:34,082
Staff Sergeant Vlček deserves
particular merit.

674
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,457
Vlček!

675
01:30:41,375 --> 01:30:42,957
Your bonus.

676
01:30:46,708 --> 01:30:48,249
Congratulations.

677
01:30:49,583 --> 01:30:54,374
Of course, there are still some
details to close the matter.

678
01:31:30,250 --> 01:31:32,665
He's one of ours, from Lidice.

679
01:31:43,458 --> 01:31:47,040
Vašek, what's happened?
What are you doing here?

680
01:31:47,208 --> 01:31:50,124
- Where did they take her?
- Who?

681
01:31:50,291 --> 01:31:52,624
Where is Anička?
I have to talk to her.

682
01:31:52,791 --> 01:31:54,790
- Who is Anička?
- I have to tell her...

683
01:31:54,958 --> 01:31:56,082
Wait!

684
01:31:57,083 --> 01:31:58,499
Leave him.

685
01:32:00,875 --> 01:32:04,582
Karel sometimes visits,
he can take a message home.

686
01:32:04,750 --> 01:32:05,707
What?

687
01:32:06,083 --> 01:32:10,124
- What are you doing here?
- I'm repairing this.

688
01:32:10,541 --> 01:32:12,165
Get up!

689
01:32:12,875 --> 01:32:15,499
Should I shoot you right here?

690
01:32:21,458 --> 01:32:23,082
Let him be.

691
01:32:29,916 --> 01:32:31,540
Take him!

692
01:32:41,083 --> 01:32:44,874
You're nuts, Šíma.
You stab your own son

693
01:32:45,041 --> 01:32:48,915
and let yourself be almost
killed because of a stranger.

694
01:32:49,083 --> 01:32:52,249
That lot have their days numbered.
So Kučera said.

695
01:32:53,208 --> 01:32:56,124
Could have had it over
and done with.

696
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:02,707
My turn.

697
01:33:53,833 --> 01:33:56,165
Move! Get moving!

698
01:34:06,041 --> 01:34:09,249
Roll-call! Into line!

699
01:34:09,416 --> 01:34:11,832
This way you'll turn out
every day.

700
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:16,040
You'll be split
into working parties.

701
01:34:16,208 --> 01:34:19,415
Until the Commander shows
you may rest.

702
01:34:40,791 --> 01:34:42,124
Please...

703
01:34:43,833 --> 01:34:48,415
We'd just like to know
where our children are.

704
01:34:48,583 --> 01:34:52,540
They left by bus.
Five days ago.

705
01:34:53,375 --> 01:34:57,582
This place isn't suitable for kids.
They are well taken care of.

706
01:34:57,750 --> 01:34:58,915
Get lost!

707
01:35:39,583 --> 01:35:43,540
- What's up with him?
- He's ill. He's been vomiting.

708
01:36:28,291 --> 01:36:30,749
The postmistress brought this.

709
01:36:31,750 --> 01:36:36,540
Undelivered post to Lidice.
They're at a loss what to do with it.

710
01:36:42,666 --> 01:36:45,040
- I'll take it away.
- No...

711
01:36:46,875 --> 01:36:48,540
Leave it here.

712
01:37:26,541 --> 01:37:30,665
- You should have told him.
- Sure, so he'd do himself in here.

713
01:37:30,875 --> 01:37:34,374
- He'll do it at home then.
- Still better than here.

714
01:37:35,416 --> 01:37:39,332
He should be grateful.
He's got a few hours peace to go.

715
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,957
See you, Mr. Šíma.

716
01:38:21,791 --> 01:38:25,457
Where are you off to, Šíma?
Straight home?

717
01:38:25,916 --> 01:38:29,957
I won't curry favour with them
if I'm not even worth a postcard.

718
01:38:30,208 --> 01:38:34,249
I'll take a few shirts, some other
things and go my own way.

719
01:38:49,875 --> 01:38:51,249
Šíma...

720
01:38:58,625 --> 01:39:00,499
Lots of luck.

721
01:41:20,625 --> 01:41:25,415
- Freezing cold. How much longer?
- Two hours to go.

722
01:41:32,125 --> 01:41:36,790
You're from Lidice?
What am I supposed to do, tell me?

723
01:41:37,958 --> 01:41:39,624
Shoot me.

724
01:41:46,083 --> 01:41:49,499
You're too late.
That event is over.

725
01:41:49,666 --> 01:41:52,040
No-one is interested in Lidice now.

726
01:41:52,208 --> 01:41:55,165
Heydrich's assassination was great.

727
01:41:56,333 --> 01:41:59,540
You say that the assassination
of Heydrich was great?

728
01:41:59,833 --> 01:42:00,999
Yes.

729
01:42:02,750 --> 01:42:04,749
Me too. It's allowed now.

730
01:42:08,166 --> 01:42:11,374
You imagine things
too black-and-white.

731
01:42:11,541 --> 01:42:15,665
What do you think? That I or my
adjutant will draw our pistols

732
01:42:15,833 --> 01:42:17,874
and shoot you in this office?

733
01:42:18,041 --> 01:42:22,249
Y'know how much paperwork
is involved? How much it costs?

734
01:42:23,250 --> 01:42:25,874
- You're not worth it.
- Come on now.

735
01:42:26,958 --> 01:42:28,249
Throw him out.

736
01:42:30,541 --> 01:42:32,415
Get walking!

737
01:42:34,083 --> 01:42:35,624
Get lost!

738
01:42:42,125 --> 01:42:43,624
František!

739
01:42:44,833 --> 01:42:46,290
Come in.

740
01:42:50,541 --> 01:42:53,082
I don't care what you think of me.

741
01:42:54,625 --> 01:42:58,457
I don't care what anyone
thinks of anybody else.

742
01:43:00,208 --> 01:43:02,124
I don't think anymore.

743
01:43:07,583 --> 01:43:09,749
And that's much better.

744
01:43:16,458 --> 01:43:17,999
Sit down.

745
01:43:29,583 --> 01:43:33,582
Isn't it funny that it's the two
of us that have remained?

746
01:43:43,958 --> 01:43:48,499
See, you weren't there,
you have some hope left.

747
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:01,207
Because you might see
your wife again.

748
01:44:05,958 --> 01:44:07,749
They still write.

749
01:44:09,250 --> 01:44:11,249
They keep on writing.

750
01:44:23,375 --> 01:44:24,957
You'll see.

751
01:44:27,375 --> 01:44:30,040
Your one will write.

752
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:34,957
Dear František, I'm afraid
I don't know whether this letter

753
01:44:35,125 --> 01:44:38,165
finds you at home, or in that place.

754
01:44:38,583 --> 01:44:43,290
I've written to you in prison but
I haven't received any replies,

755
01:44:43,458 --> 01:44:47,582
and so I just don't know
whether you are alive and well.

756
01:44:47,791 --> 01:44:52,415
Times are bad and I understand
that to write might be problematic.

757
01:44:53,208 --> 01:44:58,415
When we survived the first
terror we will survive this too.

758
01:44:58,583 --> 01:45:03,332
With all my love and honour
to you and Karel... Your Anežka.

759
01:45:08,708 --> 01:45:12,165
Heck, but what to do with you now?

760
01:45:20,250 --> 01:45:23,540
Nobody really knows
that it has been abandoned.

761
01:45:24,666 --> 01:45:27,374
Still, you must keep your eyes open.

762
01:46:05,708 --> 01:46:07,374
No news,

763
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:11,124
but I've brought you this.

764
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:23,999
This might come in handy
as well. Am I right?

765
01:46:43,208 --> 01:46:45,999
And I don't want this at my place.

766
01:46:46,916 --> 01:46:50,332
Just keep them, or throw them out.

767
01:47:03,708 --> 01:47:07,749
Dear auntie, I'm pleased to send you
my warm greetings from Poland.

768
01:47:07,916 --> 01:47:10,457
Please, I need some frocks...

769
01:47:10,625 --> 01:47:16,124
What are you up to, how are you?
Please send us some food...

770
01:47:16,458 --> 01:47:20,082
Say hello to all our friends.
Send me two pencils...

771
01:47:20,250 --> 01:47:25,165
Dear brother, I apologise for not
answering your letter until now,

772
01:47:25,333 --> 01:47:29,165
- but you know how things are...
- Dear Lola, I worry about you

773
01:47:29,333 --> 01:47:32,832
as I haven't had any news
from you for more than a month.

774
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:37,290
Sending sincere greetings,
keeping you in our memories.

775
01:48:31,625 --> 01:48:34,999
Off to Prague! Onwards!

776
01:48:39,208 --> 01:48:43,415
Come to the Czech Radio building!
As quickly as you can!

777
01:48:43,583 --> 01:48:48,999
Message for the Czech army,
Czech gendarmes! Come and help us!

778
01:48:49,166 --> 01:48:52,582
We are calling all Czechs!

779
01:48:55,958 --> 01:48:58,957
František! Where are you off to?

780
01:48:59,583 --> 01:49:01,582
I have to get to Prague.

781
01:49:02,541 --> 01:49:06,124
Not worth it, before you get there
it will be all over.

782
01:49:13,291 --> 01:49:15,624
At any rate, it was coming.

783
01:49:16,875 --> 01:49:21,582
I thought I might stay
awhile at your place.

784
01:49:47,708 --> 01:49:50,124
All the blokes are...

785
01:49:52,708 --> 01:49:54,707
Your Karel too...

786
01:49:55,875 --> 01:50:00,124
You know the old walnut tree
where the mill used to be,

787
01:50:00,541 --> 01:50:02,415
near the stream...

788
01:50:27,291 --> 01:50:30,707
The war is over, old man!

789
01:50:56,375 --> 01:50:58,540
I'll get some wood.

790
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:20,499
Citizens,
today's commemoration ceremony

791
01:52:20,666 --> 01:52:24,749
isn't there just to remember
and celebrate the heroes of Lidice,

792
01:52:24,916 --> 01:52:29,665
but also to become the official
start of a new era for this village,

793
01:52:29,833 --> 01:52:34,915
which became a mute witness
to a horrific Nazi crime.

794
01:52:36,416 --> 01:52:41,415
Women of Lidice need a new home,
and we will build it for them.

795
01:52:43,541 --> 01:52:48,749
Now please welcome our most
precious guests. Women of Lidice.

796
01:52:56,333 --> 01:52:58,665
Excuse me, you can't go there.

797
01:52:58,833 --> 01:53:00,832
- I'm from Lidice.
- And I'm from Mars.

798
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,832
- Really, I am from Lidice.
- You kidding?

799
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,082
I heard that Lidice was going
to be rebuilt.

800
01:53:06,250 --> 01:53:08,332
I could be of some help.

801
01:53:09,166 --> 01:53:12,540
I have drawn a plan.
A temporary one.

802
01:53:13,458 --> 01:53:16,082
I remember everything as it was.

803
01:53:16,250 --> 01:53:20,290
And I've brought letters
which were being delivered here.

804
01:53:22,083 --> 01:53:24,790
You know what, come with me.

805
01:53:28,333 --> 01:53:29,874
Marie...

806
01:53:42,666 --> 01:53:47,040
Look, Mr. Šíma, we naturally
value your interest,

807
01:53:48,583 --> 01:53:52,415
but the new Lidice
won't be a replica of old,

808
01:53:52,583 --> 01:53:56,624
you can't expect some ordinary
old village to arise again.

809
01:53:56,916 --> 01:54:00,124
We will hand over the letters
as far as is possible,

810
01:54:00,291 --> 01:54:04,707
the rest we could place
in a museum or such like.

811
01:54:07,250 --> 01:54:09,124
I'd like to help if possible.

812
01:54:09,291 --> 01:54:11,415
My wife hasn't returned yet...

813
01:54:11,583 --> 01:54:14,665
- What was your wife's name?
- Anežka.

814
01:54:23,875 --> 01:54:28,957
Not on the list.
I am sorry, unfortunate that is.

815
01:54:31,125 --> 01:54:33,332
They must have split up somewhere.

816
01:54:33,500 --> 01:54:37,665
Look, Mr. Šíma, the fact that
you're from Lidice,

817
01:54:38,375 --> 01:54:42,540
taking into account a certain
piety involved in their memory,

818
01:54:42,833 --> 01:54:46,874
and the reality of you in some
way being involved in it,

819
01:54:47,041 --> 01:54:49,540
is, let us say, unbecoming.

820
01:54:49,791 --> 01:54:54,499
Admit it. If you really
wish to help us

821
01:54:54,791 --> 01:54:58,290
forget about Lidice.
Nobody is waiting for you here.

822
01:55:04,166 --> 01:55:05,957
I'd like to talk to them.

823
01:55:06,125 --> 01:55:07,999
Leave me alone, how dare you!

824
01:55:12,541 --> 01:55:14,165
Let me go!

825
01:55:16,375 --> 01:55:20,999
Take him somewhere! Far away!
Make sure he doesn't make a scene.

826
01:57:56,166 --> 01:57:58,540
I thought you'd be here.

827
01:58:32,416 --> 01:58:36,124
I was with her almost to the end.
She was brave.

828
01:58:36,666 --> 01:58:40,707
She went alone to her death.
In her own way.

829
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:44,540
You really want to leave?

830
01:58:45,291 --> 01:58:47,249
You want to stay here?

831
01:58:48,291 --> 01:58:50,999
Provide them with a live memorial?

832
01:58:51,833 --> 01:58:54,415
I suppose somebody should.

833
01:58:56,375 --> 01:59:00,415
František, please.
Don't go far away.

834
01:59:02,250 --> 01:59:05,332
Nobody else... knows.

835
01:59:25,583 --> 01:59:28,249
During the war the fate
of Lidice was the only

836
01:59:28,416 --> 01:59:30,874
recognised act of genocide
by the Germans.

837
01:59:31,041 --> 01:59:32,540
173 men were shot.

838
01:59:32,708 --> 01:59:34,790
In a concentration camp
53 women died.

839
01:59:34,958 --> 01:59:37,374
82 children were gassed.
Only 17 returned.

840
01:59:37,541 --> 01:59:40,457
The destruction of Lidice
evoked a great wave of solidarity.

841
01:59:40,625 --> 01:59:43,332
Members of the Washington
Lidice Committee included

842
01:59:43,500 --> 01:59:45,874
Albert Einstein,
Charlie Chaplin, Thomas Mann.

843
01:59:46,208 --> 01:59:51,040
Places were renamed after it, people
named their daughters after Lidice.

844
01:59:51,208 --> 01:59:54,124
This custom has lasted to this day.

845
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:58,126
