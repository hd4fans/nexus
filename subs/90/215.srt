00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:52,542
Alright?

2
00:03:58,042 --> 00:04:00,126
Ok? Are you ok?

3
00:04:00,334 --> 00:04:01,209
0k, 0k

4
00:04:16,417 --> 00:04:16,917
Where are the people?

5
00:04:21,626 --> 00:04:22,251
All here

6
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:26,959
You saved one but lost two

7
00:04:33,626 --> 00:04:36,584
Which is more important?
Our teammates or the dummies?

8
00:04:38,042 --> 00:04:38,792
In a fire scene

9
00:04:38,834 --> 00:04:41,292
We don't get to choose.
Discipline is everything

10
00:04:43,251 --> 00:04:43,917
Discipline?

11
00:04:44,334 --> 00:04:44,876
Next team!

12
00:05:03,084 --> 00:05:04,292
Nowadays there're all high-rise buildings

13
00:05:04,334 --> 00:05:05,834
Fire protection systems become more important

14
00:05:06,417 --> 00:05:07,959
If unluckily that

15
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:10,042
Upper levels are on fire

16
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:11,626
It's difficult to carry out rescue

17
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:15,251
As firefighters...
the most important thing is to save people

18
00:05:16,334 --> 00:05:19,001
Enough talking

19
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:21,834
You two must come and help me

20
00:05:22,417 --> 00:05:24,626
People now have a strong sense of fire prevention

21
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,001
This business must take off

22
00:05:27,042 --> 00:05:28,167
I can give you suggestions...

23
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:29,542
on the design of your
fire protection systems

24
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,251
What do you mean, suggestions?

25
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:33,084
I want is you two to work for me

26
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:35,459
Sure. I'll file my transfer
request and join you

27
00:05:37,084 --> 00:05:37,792
How about you?

28
00:05:39,626 --> 00:05:40,584
I'm sorry, uncle

29
00:05:41,334 --> 00:05:42,501
But I just got a promotion

30
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:46,709
Tai Kwan, think about it

31
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,667
Isn't it good to spend your energy
for a worthier cause...

32
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:50,126
to help more people?

33
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:54,834
Every year much farmland
is turned into skyscrapers

34
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:57,459
Farmers keep moving to the city

35
00:05:58,376 --> 00:05:59,501
Sometimes I think...

36
00:05:59,917 --> 00:06:01,459
not until we run out
of rice in supermarkets

37
00:06:02,084 --> 00:06:04,001
do we know how important farmers are

38
00:06:25,584 --> 00:06:26,917
Today foggy weather

According to the Observatory
(Four Years Later)

41
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:33,626
affected by rainstorms over the past three days,
the weather is humid

42
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:36,792
Today the temperature increases sharply
dueto the bright sunshine

43
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:38,751
and it brings radiation fog

44
00:06:39,251 --> 00:06:41,334
The temperature is 34 degrees

45
00:06:41,376 --> 00:06:43,417
relative humidity is 99%

46
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:44,376
Weather is very humid

47
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:46,292
Hi friend...

48
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:49,709
You had chocolate again?

49
00:06:49,751 --> 00:06:50,792
No I didn't

50
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:54,792
You didn't?

51
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,792
It's never bothered me before

52
00:07:01,001 --> 00:07:01,709
but...

53
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:04,959
you'll be a father soon.
Cut down on junk food.

54
00:07:05,917 --> 00:07:06,792
You see...

55
00:07:07,917 --> 00:07:08,876
it melted like hell.

56
00:07:09,334 --> 00:07:11,376
It's been there forever uneaten.
I just didn't throw it away

57
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:13,792
Did you drink the vitamin shake...

58
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:14,709
<i>mm?</i>

59
00:07:14,876 --> 00:07:16,292
What's in it?

60
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:19,876
Meaning you never tried it

61
00:07:20,251 --> 00:07:21,084
Of course, I did

62
00:07:22,001 --> 00:07:24,792
You told me to drink it after meals every day.
And I did

63
00:07:25,751 --> 00:07:27,667
After going to the doctor with me,
when is your meeting?

64
00:07:27,917 --> 00:07:29,542
I can't go to the doctor with you

65
00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:31,792
<i>I'll</i> leave after dropping you off

66
00:07:32,042 --> 00:07:32,959
Haven't I told you?

67
00:07:33,001 --> 00:07:34,126
When did you tell me?

68
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,584
I don't remember.
But I did anyway

69
00:07:37,626 --> 00:07:38,292
<i>61m!</i>

70
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:39,542

71
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,167
Did not.

72
00:07:42,751 --> 00:07:43,834
Maybe I didn't...

73
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:45,917
They moved the meeting up

74
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:49,417
Just call me when you're done, ok?

75
00:07:53,251 --> 00:07:55,376
Do you have problem
accepting my pregnancy?

76
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:57,251
Of course not.

77
00:07:57,334 --> 00:07:59,251
I told you I want a baby

78
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:01,001
And now you're pregnant,
how perfect

79
00:08:01,626 --> 00:08:03,251
You want it because I forced you to...

80
00:08:03,292 --> 00:08:04,417
do you really want it?

81
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:13,042
How about resignation?

82
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,542
Shall we discuss it tonight?

83
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:30,209
We've talked about it so many times.
I just want you to know...

84
00:08:30,626 --> 00:08:31,751
it's all for our child

85
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:33,167
Yes, I know

86
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:37,834
Just chute it for me.

87
00:08:37,876 --> 00:08:38,751
I'm not eating it anyway

88
00:08:44,251 --> 00:08:45,459
Remember to call me
after seeing the doctor

89
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:47,959
Ok

90

Yes, it's been a while

How are you?

97
00:09:32,501 --> 00:09:35,459
Pretty good. My company opens today,
on the 40th floor

98
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:36,626

Maybe we come together

107
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:55,751
Firefighters don't have plans

108
00:09:56,001 --> 00:09:57,834
Ask him to come only
if he truly wants to

109
00:10:00,126 --> 00:10:00,792
Which floor?

110
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:02,584
14th. Over here

111
00:10:06,917 --> 00:10:08,417
You haven't seen your brother
for four years, right?

112
00:10:14,251 --> 00:10:14,959

How could they be the same?
Have you got your eyes checked?

00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:38,334
It's the perfect job for you

170
00:13:40,917 --> 00:13:42,584
I used to think I'd be a firefighter for life

171
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:44,959
We did training drills
and wiped down the tools

172
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:47,459
every day

173
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:51,584
Accidents don't wait

174
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:55,084
We can only be prepared
in the best possible ways

But whenever I see...

176
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:00,542
someone died in a fire

177
00:14:03,084 --> 00:14:04,084
I asked myself

178
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:06,542
Was there more I could've done?

179
00:14:09,292 --> 00:14:09,959
In the past...

180
00:14:11,292 --> 00:14:12,959
I saved one person at a time

181
00:14:14,292 --> 00:14:14,959
But now...

182
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:19,001
I want our fire protection systems
to protect more people

quit at this point

212
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:39,459

That's normal.

218

249
00:19:49,126 --> 00:19:51,501

Part of the basement
may not have air-conditioning

252
00:19:55,709 --> 00:19:59,001
We didn't expect it to be so foggy
<i>as</i> soon <i>as</i> the air-conditioning is off...

I'm leading the people down the stairs.
The basement is on fire

352
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:57,376
If you can contain it,
you don't have to raise it to two-alarm

353

it's two-alarm already.
There was <i>an</i> explosion on 1st floor

Did you say there is a
tower ladder?

430
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,042
We're on the back of the building

431
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:11,126
It takes too long to drive
the tower ladder here

432
00:36:15,251 --> 00:36:15,834
Come here...

433
00:36:16,959 --> 00:36:17,709

437
00:36:21,501 --> 00:36:22,792
Watch carefully.
Do the same later on.

438

Yes!

441
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:44,501
I'll go up first.
If the fire comes close

442
00:36:45,126 --> 00:36:46,834
throw this grenade to the base of the fire.
It makes the fire weaker for a while

443
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:12,501
Be quick...

444
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:15,459

449
00:38:49,584 --> 00:38:51,042
No way...
We can't even save ourselves...

450
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:51,876
we will both die

451
00:39:03,042 --> 00:39:03,751
Are you insane?

452
00:39:05,459 --> 00:39:07,959
Are you saving them...
or yourself?

453
00:39:08,376 --> 00:39:09,251

Ok...

460
00:40:09,459 --> 00:40:10,459
Go save the doctor. Quick

461
00:40:12,251 --> 00:40:14,667
Just like what I did just now...
tie the rope around your waist

462
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:20,501
Got it?

463

00:44:09,251 --> 00:44:10,042
Your wife is waiting for you!

505
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:23,001
He said he won't be here soon

506
00:44:31,042 --> 00:44:33,626
Calm down, everyone.
We'll get you out very soon

507
00:44:35,376 --> 00:44:37,084
Calling control team...
I'm in a clinic on 10/F

508
00:44:37,417 --> 00:44:39,042
we found around 20 injured victims

509
00:44:39,542 --> 00:44:40,709
Arrange tower ladder
to get them out immediately

510
00:44:49,834 --> 00:44:50,501
Calm down

511
00:44:50,834 --> 00:44:52,001
We will get you out via tower ladder

512
00:44:56,167 --> 00:44:58,834
Help us...
help

513
00:45:03,501 --> 00:45:05,959
Help...

514
00:45:24,626 --> 00:45:25,834
Captain, The tower ladder is here

515
00:45:26,917 --> 00:45:28,209
You take the injured down
the tower ladder

516
00:45:28,417 --> 00:45:29,626
The rest follow me
to the refuge floor

517
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:57,084
I can't walk anymore...
I think I won't make it...

518
00:46:03,876 --> 00:46:06,876
Without that shop...
it's okay...

519
00:46:09,376 --> 00:46:12,876
But...
I can't live without Lam-lam...

520
00:46:13,334 --> 00:46:15,042
without our daughter...

521
00:46:16,834 --> 00:46:17,417
If you have to go

522
00:46:19,167 --> 00:46:20,167
Let's look for her together

523
00:46:28,126 --> 00:46:30,501
Bo-keung

524
00:46:33,084 --> 00:46:33,792
Bo-keung

525
00:46:35,917 --> 00:46:36,667
Bo-keung!

526
00:46:47,334 --> 00:46:48,042
Bo-keung...

527
00:46:48,834 --> 00:46:51,917
don't scare me, brat...

528
00:46:56,126 --> 00:46:57,126
You know this place well

529
00:46:57,834 --> 00:47:00,626
You must know how to escape!

530
00:47:22,334 --> 00:47:22,959
Open it

531
00:47:23,334 --> 00:47:23,959
<i>Gk'.!</i>

532
00:47:33,209 --> 00:47:33,876
Go upstairs

533
00:47:33,959 --> 00:47:34,542
Ok

534
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:00,126
You stay here and take a rest,
<i>I'll</i> take a look around

535
00:48:14,834 --> 00:48:17,417
Excuse me.
Have you seen my daughter?

536
00:48:35,417 --> 00:48:38,084
Excuse me.
Have you seen this little girl?

537
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:41,376
She is my daughter

538
00:49:03,126 --> 00:49:03,959
I saw her

539
00:49:09,126 --> 00:49:12,417
Really? Where is she? Where is she?

540
00:49:16,167 --> 00:49:19,959
Where is she?
Where is she?

541
00:49:23,626 --> 00:49:24,417
Where is she?

542
00:49:25,917 --> 00:49:27,042
I don't know where she is

543
00:49:29,792 --> 00:49:31,959
Maybe someone took her out.
But I'm not sure

544
00:49:34,834 --> 00:49:35,917
She said not sure...

545
00:49:38,376 --> 00:49:40,251
But I believe she will be fine

546
00:49:41,251 --> 00:49:41,959
Thank you...

547
00:49:42,001 --> 00:49:43,292
<i>gm gsnxxwcefil</i>

548
00:49:51,209 --> 00:49:52,251
Why did you lie to them?

549
00:49:53,376 --> 00:49:55,084
What if they find their daughter's body?

550
00:49:58,542 --> 00:49:59,626
Why are you staring at me?

551
00:50:02,042 --> 00:50:03,042
Why are you staring at me?

552
00:50:05,084 --> 00:50:07,001
Yes. I am a doctor

553
00:50:07,251 --> 00:50:08,584
But I'm just an Ob-gyn

554
00:50:09,126 --> 00:50:11,251
I save people in an operating room.
Not in a fire scene!

555
00:50:15,042 --> 00:50:15,917
Obviously you know

556
00:50:17,459 --> 00:50:18,251
If we go in

557
00:50:19,834 --> 00:50:21,001
we will both die

558
00:50:23,376 --> 00:50:24,334
I am a doctor

559
00:50:25,459 --> 00:50:26,626
But I'm only human

560
00:50:28,501 --> 00:50:29,751

Dong, are you crazy?

563
00:51:07,459 --> 00:51:09,459
We can't keep them.
We've killed...

564
00:51:10,417 --> 00:51:12,876
Listen to me.
We didn't kill anyone

565
00:51:13,167 --> 00:51:15,376
He was burnt to death.
As long <i>as</i> we keep our mouth shut

566
00:51:15,834 --> 00:51:16,667
No one would ever know

567
00:51:36,417 --> 00:51:37,334
I've arrived.
Where are you?

568
00:51:37,876 --> 00:51:38,667
Two more floors
from the refuge floor

569
00:51:39,876 --> 00:51:40,959
The steel reinforcements
inside the ceiling swelled

570
00:51:41,792 --> 00:51:42,542
The fire must be rampant upstairs

571
00:51:43,917 --> 00:51:44,709
There are more than 10 of us here

572
00:51:47,209 --> 00:51:48,459
What if others know?

573
00:51:48,792 --> 00:51:49,751
Ho... Ho...

Calm down

578
00:51:57,126 --> 00:51:57,792
Think about...

579
00:51:58,126 --> 00:51:59,917
how our boss bullied us

580
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:01,626
As long <i>as</i> we have these diamonds

581
00:52:01,917 --> 00:52:02,959
We have everything

582
00:52:03,376 --> 00:52:04,167
You think about it

583
00:52:05,667 --> 00:52:07,001
These will get us in trouble

00:52:32,376 --> 00:52:35,001
Why are you still here?
You don't know you should leave?

587
00:52:36,292 --> 00:52:37,709
I came back for you!

588
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:52,584
Where are you?
Are you ok?

589
00:52:53,126 --> 00:52:55,084
We all left the building via
the tower ladder

590
00:52:59,417 --> 00:53:02,251
Keung... Keung...

591

00:53:08,001 --> 00:53:08,876
so great that you're safe

593

Take good care of yourself

00:53:19,751 --> 00:53:22,876
I'll wait for you! I'll wait for you!

595
00:53:53,376 --> 00:53:55,709
(How's it?)

596
00:53:57,042 --> 00:53:58,626
I've told firefighters the situation

597
00:53:59,626 --> 00:54:00,459
They will be here in no time

598
00:54:04,126 --> 00:54:05,251
I don't know what you've done

599
00:54:06,584 --> 00:54:08,376
But if you leave,
you will be burnt to death

600
00:54:21,042 --> 00:54:23,084
Captain, big trouble.
Much dangerous chemical inside

601
00:54:31,959 --> 00:54:32,709
Don't worry

602
00:54:33,376 --> 00:54:34,792
Take care of yourself
and your wife first

603
00:54:41,834 --> 00:54:42,834
Has the chemical truck arrived?

604
00:54:43,084 --> 00:54:43,792
Yes, it has

605
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:49,792
An occupant of the building
has turned himself in

606
00:54:50,084 --> 00:54:51,584
He stored dangerous goods
on refuge floor

607
00:54:51,959 --> 00:54:53,917
You guys have to leave now
and wait for backup support

608
00:54:54,709 --> 00:54:56,042
There are many people waiting
in the refuge floor

609
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:56,834
t's disastrous if it explodes

610
00:54:56,959 --> 00:54:58,209
Any way to stop it from exploding?

611
00:54:59,292 --> 00:55:00,417
You can't use water

612
00:55:01,001 --> 00:55:02,459
Any sand bags in the office

613
00:55:03,376 --> 00:55:04,167
Use sand to cover it

614
00:55:05,167 --> 00:55:06,959
Why did you pack the chemical
in bottled water cartons...

Get down!

625

Crawl over there!

626
00:58:11,959 --> 00:58:12,959

Over.

632

You cut yourself...

00:59:11,001 --> 00:59:12,542
Why didn't you save me

00:59:14,917 --> 00:59:15,709
That question again

637
00:59:28,459 --> 00:59:29,834
I tried my very best to protect myself

638
00:59:31,959 --> 00:59:33,834
just to keep our baby

639
00:59:35,917 --> 00:59:36,959
You don't care, do you?

640

No you don't

644
00:59:51,751 --> 00:59:53,501
This alarm goes off
if I stay stillfor 30 seconds...

645
00:59:54,959 --> 00:59:56,959
to let others know I'm in danger

646
00:59:59,667 --> 01:00:00,667
In a fire scene,
it only takes 30 seconds

647
01:00:02,334 --> 01:00:03,334
to lose one's life

648
01:00:09,917 --> 01:00:10,876
Saving life is my job

649
01:00:12,584 --> 01:00:13,876
I can't choose to save some over others

650
01:00:30,292 --> 01:00:31,334
I will take you out for sure

651
01:00:33,292 --> 01:00:35,709
Captain...
the tanks are out of air

652
01:00:39,834 --> 01:00:41,834
Send officers 1 and 2 to do a survey,
others...

653
01:00:43,292 --> 01:00:43,959
I've found a spot

654
01:00:44,334 --> 01:00:45,876
connected to the west wing if we climb up

655
01:00:46,167 --> 01:00:48,542
Tell your team to take victims up there

656

What else can we do?

659
01:00:54,917 --> 01:00:55,876
The tower ladder can't reach that high

660
01:00:56,126 --> 01:00:56,959
Your proposal doesn't work

661
01:00:57,376 --> 01:00:58,084
Why not?

662
01:00:59,126 --> 01:01:00,084
It's against your rules, right?

663
01:01:00,126 --> 01:01:02,042
Listen to me.

Listen to you?

01:01:05,667 --> 01:01:06,584
I listened and

666
01:01:06,626 --> 01:01:07,667
that's how our father died!

667
01:01:20,792 --> 01:01:22,334
We split into two teams then

sent us to save the kids in a kindergarten

670
01:01:30,376 --> 01:01:31,084
Another team...

671
01:01:31,584 --> 01:01:32,667
to the elderly home to save our father

672
01:01:36,167 --> 01:01:37,167
I'm not convinced...

673
01:01:41,334 --> 01:01:43,251
he followed the rules on everything

674
01:01:46,251 --> 01:01:47,126
We ended up losing our father...

675
01:01:53,584 --> 01:01:54,167
No wonder...

676
01:01:56,501 --> 01:01:58,417
you two haven't met since the funeral

677
01:02:00,584 --> 01:02:01,209
He never mentioned it

678
01:02:03,167 --> 01:02:03,959
and I dared not ask...

679
01:02:05,876 --> 01:02:07,501
I'm ok with my father's death
being an accident

680
01:02:11,042 --> 01:02:12,876
But if a firefighter
doesn't get to choose

681
01:02:13,959 --> 01:02:14,792
I'd rather not be one

682
01:02:21,959 --> 01:02:22,751
No choice...

683
01:02:40,251 --> 01:02:41,584
051 calling control team

684
01:02:41,709 --> 01:02:43,167
I see a tower crane in the
construction siteacross the road

685
01:02:43,209 --> 01:02:44,251
We can use it to save people

686
01:02:55,334 --> 01:02:56,209
Are you the person in charge in here?

687
01:02:56,667 --> 01:02:57,501
Yes, officer

688
01:02:57,542 --> 01:02:59,084
We would need to use your tower crane

689
01:02:59,417 --> 01:03:00,334
Get someone up there
to unlock the turntable

690
01:03:00,376 --> 01:03:01,292
and swing it

691
01:03:01,501 --> 01:03:02,917
to the building across the road

692
01:03:05,626 --> 01:03:07,834
It's possible,
if it's on manually control

693
01:03:08,501 --> 01:03:11,001
But the tower crane won't be
very stable on manual mode

694
01:03:18,917 --> 01:03:19,459
Just do it

695
01:03:21,501 --> 01:03:22,459
Go check out the situation
over there

696
01:03:22,501 --> 01:03:23,126
Yes

697
01:03:23,167 --> 01:03:24,251
Change to manual control

698
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:25,292
Yes, yes...

699
01:03:26,167 --> 01:03:27,209
Move the crane to the south-west

700
01:03:27,834 --> 01:03:30,167
Yes. Pointing to that building
across the road

701
01:03:30,876 --> 01:03:31,626
We can try it

702
01:03:31,959 --> 01:03:32,959
Just be careful

703
01:03:33,001 --> 01:03:34,501
Copy. Everyone stand by

704
01:03:38,042 --> 01:03:39,709
Reporting live from the scene...

705
01:03:39,751 --> 01:03:43,501
a tower crane in the construction
sitenear the building on fire...

706
01:03:43,542 --> 01:03:45,376
slowly swings towards the building...

707
01:03:45,417 --> 01:03:48,001
We believeit's an emergency
measure instructed by...

708
01:03:48,042 --> 01:03:49,584
the firefighter who went in
the construction site

709
01:04:01,959 --> 01:04:02,542
He said...

710
01:04:05,334 --> 01:04:07,917
he wanted us to travel together

711
01:04:08,751 --> 01:04:11,251
He wanted us to spend more time together

712
01:04:41,042 --> 01:04:41,584
Stop!

713
01:04:45,459 --> 01:04:45,959
Attention please

714
01:04:46,501 --> 01:04:47,751
We crawl on the tower crane

715
01:04:47,792 --> 01:04:48,501
and then go down

716
01:04:48,876 --> 01:04:49,584
Just be careful

717
01:04:49,876 --> 01:04:50,584
One after another

718
01:04:51,001 --> 01:04:52,834
Try not to look down. Got it?

719
01:04:53,334 --> 01:04:53,959
Got it

720
01:04:54,584 --> 01:04:55,126
<i>I'll</i> go first

721
01:05:14,084 --> 01:05:15,167
Be careful...
don't be afraid...

722
01:05:16,251 --> 01:05:16,876
slowly...

723
01:05:43,459 --> 01:05:46,084
Now the firefighters are
on the crane already

724
01:05:46,501 --> 01:05:48,251
We believe they make use
of the crane to rescue people...

725
01:05:55,126 --> 01:05:57,042
Si Lok, Hold my hand. Come on

726
01:05:58,959 --> 01:05:59,459
Be careful

727
01:06:00,167 --> 01:06:00,709
Get out!

728
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:03,251
Be careful, don't...

729
01:06:03,917 --> 01:06:04,376
Be careful

730
01:06:11,084 --> 01:06:11,626
Buddy Ho, help me...

731
01:06:11,709 --> 01:06:12,917
Don't jump!

732
01:06:22,042 --> 01:06:22,626
Buddy Ho...

733
01:06:39,376 --> 01:06:40,001
Don't jump!

734
01:06:40,084 --> 01:06:41,459
Buddy Ho... Help me...

735
01:06:41,709 --> 01:06:42,876
Buddy Ho... Help me...

736
01:06:48,501 --> 01:06:49,167
Dong!

737
01:07:05,251 --> 01:07:05,917
Tai Kwan

738
01:07:08,334 --> 01:07:09,751
Swing the crane back!

739
01:07:11,751 --> 01:07:12,709
Can't move it

740
01:07:16,209 --> 01:07:16,792
Catch it!

741
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:27,459
<i>I'll</i> throw you the rope...

742
01:07:28,501 --> 01:07:29,126
You have to catch it...

743
01:07:36,376 --> 01:07:37,167
Now tie the rope on your hand

744
01:07:37,917 --> 01:07:40,001
<i>I'll</i> count to three and pull you up

745
01:07:42,459 --> 01:07:45,251
1' 25

746
01:07:49,209 --> 01:07:50,084
Hold the rope tightly!

747
01:08:33,792 --> 01:08:34,459
Don't let go!

748
01:09:01,084 --> 01:09:01,792
Pull the end!

749
01:09:24,292 --> 01:09:24,917
Bro...

750
01:09:47,959 --> 01:09:49,959
it's ok... it's ok now...

751
01:09:53,126 --> 01:09:54,792
Sorry... Sorry

752
01:10:01,959 --> 01:10:02,792
Really sorry

753
01:10:37,542 --> 01:10:39,792
Chief, Squadron <i>#3</i> finished search
and rescue

754
01:10:40,251 --> 01:10:41,167
How did it go?

755
01:10:41,459 --> 01:10:43,501
Search and rescuefrom the 1/F
to 25/F basically a success

756
01:10:43,751 --> 01:10:45,792
Most victims are evacuated

757
01:10:47,667 --> 01:10:48,376
Well done

758
01:11:05,292 --> 01:11:05,959
This way

759
01:11:18,709 --> 01:11:21,042
Dad, are you okay?

760
01:11:24,459 --> 01:11:25,334
Do you feel better that way?

761
01:11:26,792 --> 01:11:27,917
It's trachea problem

762
01:11:28,376 --> 01:11:30,334
He can't inhale any more
smoke given his situation

763
01:11:37,667 --> 01:11:39,376
You are more familiar with this building.
How is it up there?

764
01:11:40,334 --> 01:11:40,834
Come to my office

765
01:11:41,167 --> 01:11:42,626
Our isolation system
should block the fire

766
01:11:43,917 --> 01:11:44,501
Let's go together

767
01:12:05,084 --> 01:12:06,376
Doctor, what do you need?

768
01:12:07,334 --> 01:12:08,459
I must operate on him now

769
01:12:09,792 --> 01:12:10,959
Do you have a knife? And bandage?

770
01:12:22,292 --> 01:12:24,917
Si Lok, the dummy has a surviving kit on it.
There is bandage inside.

771
01:12:30,334 --> 01:12:31,001
Disinfectant.
Ok

772
01:12:45,417 --> 01:12:46,001
Hello there

773
01:12:48,167 --> 01:12:49,584
Don't be afraid... come with me

774
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:53,501
Your daughter is here!

775
01:12:59,751 --> 01:13:00,417
Run!

776
01:13:15,542 --> 01:13:16,709
Lam-lam...

777
01:13:23,126 --> 01:13:24,542
Help...

778
01:13:35,209 --> 01:13:36,417
Run, Tai Kwan!

779
01:13:44,667 --> 01:13:46,251
Hold her down...

780
01:13:47,292 --> 01:13:48,001
You go on saving him...

781
01:13:50,126 --> 01:13:52,459
Lam-lam...

782
01:14:02,917 --> 01:14:05,209
save my daughter...

783
01:14:14,667 --> 01:14:16,042
Save them first...

784
01:14:28,126 --> 01:14:29,126
Help...

785
01:14:30,251 --> 01:14:30,876
Come on out...

786
01:14:32,501 --> 01:14:33,376
Come out quick!

787
01:14:56,959 --> 01:14:57,501
Go...

788
01:14:57,917 --> 01:14:59,042
Tai Kwan...

789
01:15:32,417 --> 01:15:33,084
Thank you

790
01:15:37,667 --> 01:15:38,376
Mommy

791
01:15:38,459 --> 01:15:40,917
Lam-lam, Mommy won't leave you behind

792
01:16:27,917 --> 01:16:28,417
Move away...

793
01:16:46,459 --> 01:16:47,209
No...

794
01:16:51,834 --> 01:16:52,501
Keung...

795
01:16:55,042 --> 01:16:55,751
Keung...

796
01:17:06,876 --> 01:17:08,876
Keung... Keung...

797
01:17:12,292 --> 01:17:13,084
Keung...

798
01:17:48,751 --> 01:17:49,167
Keung...

799
01:17:53,501 --> 01:17:54,917
Keung, this is your brother.
Can you hear me?

800
01:18:10,167 --> 01:18:10,959
Keung...

801
01:18:13,459 --> 01:18:14,792
Keung, can you hear me?

802
01:18:17,251 --> 01:18:18,126
Keung!

803
01:18:23,209 --> 01:18:25,042
I'm fine! I'm fine!

804
01:18:51,667 --> 01:18:52,292
Keung

805
01:19:04,334 --> 01:19:05,709
How's it down there?

806
01:19:09,834 --> 01:19:12,376
The water here is several floors deep

807
01:19:13,251 --> 01:19:13,959
What do you want to do?

808
01:19:14,251 --> 01:19:15,542
I want dive down...

809
01:19:16,709 --> 01:19:17,584
and see if there is any way out

810
01:19:25,417 --> 01:19:26,084
But the fire is big out there

811
01:19:28,501 --> 01:19:29,334
The water's getting hot

812
01:19:30,751 --> 01:19:31,584
If it boils

813
01:19:32,501 --> 01:19:34,209
we may miss our last chance

814
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:41,334
Bro

815
01:19:45,959 --> 01:19:46,709
Have you ever thought that...

816
01:19:48,751 --> 01:19:50,084
if I didn't listen to you and...

817
01:19:51,042 --> 01:19:52,251
went upstairs to save dad,
what would happen?

818
01:20:01,167 --> 01:20:02,417
Actually I knew the answer...

819
01:20:08,001 --> 01:20:09,167
Dad will die anyway...

820
01:20:25,209 --> 01:20:26,667
But I really wanted to try at least

821
01:20:31,084 --> 01:20:31,751
You did nothing wrong

822
01:20:38,376 --> 01:20:39,084
And me neither

823
01:20:40,834 --> 01:20:41,959
I don't want anything
bad happening to you

824
01:21:27,167 --> 01:21:29,459
If you can open the elevator door
on the first floor

825
01:21:30,834 --> 01:21:31,792
The water can put out the fire...

826
01:21:32,626 --> 01:21:33,917
We may have a chance to go out

827
01:21:35,167 --> 01:21:36,209
Not all of us are divers

828
01:21:36,667 --> 01:21:38,459
There are breathing masks
and air tanks in my office

829
01:21:43,709 --> 01:21:46,376
Think of a way to pump up
the water pressure

830
01:21:51,417 --> 01:21:52,459
Pour water into the elevator shaft

831
01:21:53,251 --> 01:21:55,209
Cut the cable and let the car fall

832
01:21:56,792 --> 01:21:57,959
051 calling control team

833
01:21:58,292 --> 01:22:01,376
Requesting all the hoses watering
the elevator shaft

834
01:22:34,417 --> 01:22:36,376
We climb down this ladder

835
01:22:39,917 --> 01:22:42,042
It's so deep...
How can we do it?

836
01:22:45,667 --> 01:22:46,459
<i>I'll</i> go first

837
01:22:50,959 --> 01:22:51,501
Si Lok

838
01:22:52,251 --> 01:22:53,834
Don't look down.
Just look at the ladder

839
01:22:55,042 --> 01:22:56,251
You try. I'll hold you

840
01:22:56,459 --> 01:22:57,084
Don't worry

841
01:23:25,542 --> 01:23:26,251
Come on. You try

842
01:23:29,001 --> 01:23:30,626
Don't look down.
Just look at the stairs

843
01:23:42,001 --> 01:23:44,334
Slowly... Careful

844
01:23:52,584 --> 01:23:55,001
Don't be afraid

845
01:23:55,751 --> 01:23:56,417
Don't be afraid

846
01:23:56,459 --> 01:23:58,667
Your mom is over there...

847
01:24:59,667 --> 01:25:00,459
Tai Kwan

848
01:26:05,501 --> 01:26:06,292
Si Lok!

849
01:26:17,209 --> 01:26:18,084
Jump!

850
01:26:19,792 --> 01:26:20,584
Jump!

851
01:26:23,709 --> 01:26:26,084
Jump everyone!
We're running out of time

852
01:26:27,709 --> 01:26:29,584
Si Lok! Jump now

853
01:26:47,292 --> 01:26:47,959
Come here!

854
01:26:57,084 --> 01:26:59,501
The water is very deep!
Come down now

855
01:27:35,209 --> 01:27:37,584
Everyone, listen.
We all dive into the water later on...

856
01:27:38,667 --> 01:27:39,792
and open the elevator door together

857
01:27:40,209 --> 01:27:41,334
And we will have a chance to go out

858
01:27:52,084 --> 01:27:53,751
Keung, <i>I'll</i> cut the cable soon

859
01:27:54,376 --> 01:27:56,876
Let's check the time.
Let me know when you're ready

860
01:27:57,542 --> 01:27:58,209
Ok

861
01:28:05,459 --> 01:28:06,501
Why don't you come down?

862
01:28:24,251 --> 01:28:25,084
What does your brother want to do?

863
01:28:31,042 --> 01:28:31,876
There is no choice

864
01:28:33,834 --> 01:28:34,792
in a fire scene at all

865
01:28:45,209 --> 01:28:46,042
One minute

866
01:29:01,251 --> 01:29:02,209
We only have one chance

867
01:29:02,751 --> 01:29:04,209
Take a deep breath and dive

868
01:29:05,084 --> 01:29:05,751
Understood?

869
01:29:22,501 --> 01:29:24,792
1,2,3...

870
01:32:21,126 --> 01:32:23,084
Lam-lam... are you ok?

871
01:32:26,209 --> 01:32:26,792
Dad

872
01:32:52,459 --> 01:32:53,001
Si Lok...

873
01:32:54,959 --> 01:32:55,542
Si Lok...

874
01:32:56,584 --> 01:32:57,376
Are you ok?

875
01:33:30,792 --> 01:33:31,584
Bro...

876
01:33:34,959 --> 01:33:35,626
Bro...

877
01:36:02,834 --> 01:36:03,751
Is everyone ok?

878
01:36:23,251 --> 01:36:25,084
Are you ok? Let's go

879
01:36:29,626 --> 01:36:30,292
What was it?

880
01:36:54,001 --> 01:36:55,251
Our baby is gone...

881
01:37:25,917 --> 01:37:26,959
Nothing is more important than you

882
01:37:28,876 --> 01:37:29,959
so great that you're safe

883
01:37:36,209 --> 01:37:37,834
From the moment I came in,
I knew I will take you out

884
01:37:38,792 --> 01:37:39,501
See?

885
01:39:30,959 --> 01:39:33,834
Where's papa?
Why hasn't papa come out?

886
01:41:13,292 --> 01:41:14,751
I resigned this morning

887
01:41:17,334 --> 01:41:17,876
Actually...

888
01:41:19,542 --> 01:41:21,001
you may want to think again

889
01:42:13,834 --> 01:42:16,167
I'm getting married.
Can you join our banquet?

890
01:42:16,876 --> 01:42:18,376
Sure I will

891
01:42:19,001 --> 01:42:19,792
Has mom known it yet?

892
01:42:20,376 --> 01:42:21,001
Not yet

893
01:42:22,917 --> 01:42:23,626
You got a phone on you?

894
01:42:23,667 --> 01:42:24,709
Give me your phone

895
01:42:25,292 --> 01:42:26,334
Mine's broken
