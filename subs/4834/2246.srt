1
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,120
I just missed your heart.

2
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,770
You are dead, right now.

3
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,150
I've killed you.

4
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:47,930
Use your hands.

5
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,280
Drag the deer back yourself.

6
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,560
What's wrong?

7
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,630
Are you hurt?

8
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,760
You were half asleep.

9
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,150
You must always be ready.

10
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,500
Even when you're sleeping.

11
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,490
Think on your feet.

12
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,490
- Adapt... - Or die.

13
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,290
I'll do better next time.

14
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,880
German.

15
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,790
I'll do better next time.

16
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,090
Italian.

17
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,690
I'll do better next time.

18
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,780
Spanish.

19
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,740
Espanol.

20
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,280
Did you really want me to snap your neck?

21
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,250
How much did you pull off the deer?

22
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,880
In 120 parts.

23
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,840
200 pounds in total.

24
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,340
I think so.

25
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,840
That explains it.

26
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,760
What?

27
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,260
How you beat me.

28
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,970
You've getting stronger.

29
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,070
I'm glad you didn't snap my neck.

30
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,360
The great blue whale is the largest animal to have ever existed.

31
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,200
Its heart weighs 1300 pounds.

32
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,660
And the male has 7 gallons of...

33
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,150
testicles.

34
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,370
The blue whale's music can be heard for over five hundred miles...

35
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,120
A blue whale's tongue weighs over two and a half tons.

36
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,910
What does music feel like?

37
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,790
Music- a combination of sounds

38
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:57,130
with a view to beauty of form and expression of emotion.

39
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,500
I want to hear it for myself.

40
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,720
We've all we need right here.

41
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,990
It's not enough.

42
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,800
I'm ready.

43
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,670
Papa, I'm ready.

44
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:38,960


45
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:32,060
1  2  3  4  5  6
One, two, three, four, five, six.

46
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,030
I live in Leipzig German city.

47
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,290
Population: 0.7 million peoples.

48
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,370
Tell me again.

49
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,670
Wilhelm Grimm's House Stefan Stra¦Âe,

50
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,080
21610559, Berlin, Germany.

51
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,490
We live at number 7, Vicenza Platz.

52
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,530
I go to school at The Klaus College Gymnasium.

53
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:51,400
And my best friends are Rudy Gunter and Clara Scheitz.

54
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,090
Wilhelm Grimm's House Stefan Stra¦Âe,

55
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,960
21610559, Berlin, Germany.

56
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,560
I like literature and sport.

57
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,560
In particular, tennis and athletics.

58
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,910
We live at number 7, Vicenza Platz.

59
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,960
I go to school at The Klaus College Gymnasium.

60
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,010
And my best friends are Rudy Gunter and Clara Scheitz.

61
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,830
I also have a dog called Trudy.

62
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,810
I'm ready.

63
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,540
I'm ready now.

64
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,120
3  4  5  6
Three, four, five, six.

65
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,020
Did you see it? Did you hear it?

66
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,420
It's like thunder! It was so beautiful!

67
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,240
What is it?

68
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,430
It tells Marissa Wiegler where we are.

69
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,640
If you think you're ready, and you want to leave here,

70
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,970
all you have to do is flip that switch.

71
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,440
But once it's done there's no going back.

72
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:28,020
She won't stop until you're dead, or she is.

73
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:29,930
You understand?

74
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,870
I won't be there to hold your hand.

75
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,790
So be sure.

76
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,380
Be sure it's what you really want.

77
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,380
It's here. There's no rush.

78
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:03,330
Laika, a mongrel dog from the street of Moscow,

79
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,420
was the first animal to orbit the Earth.

80
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,800
She was launched into outer space on the third of November, 1957.

81
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,800
Scientists believe humans

82
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,880
would be unable to survive the conditions of outer space.

83
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,930
So flights by animals were used

84
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,840
as experiments precursory to human missions.

85
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,050
A rocket was not designed to be retrievable,

86
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:32,000
and Laika has always been, intended to die.

87
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,850
But she didn't, did she?

88
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,390
They couldn't bring the rocket back, remember?

89
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,700
I remember.

90
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,020
But sometimes I wish you would read it differently.

91
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,700
When a star collapses,

92
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,580
the supernova explosion is ten billion times

93
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,380
brighter than the other stars.

94
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,380
Will you hunt with me?

95
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,300
If you want.

96
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,860
Well, it's up to you.

97
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,990
- Me? - Yes.

98
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,080
I'll stay.

99
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:52,870
Yes, good.

100
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,100
Marissa Wiegler...

101
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,320
come and find me.

102
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,950
You were lucky to have caught that deer.

103
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,130
There was nothing out there today.

104
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,080
The smell's good.

105
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,270
When will it be ready?

106
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,750
Soon.

107
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,610
We've picked up an unencrypted signal. One of ours.

108
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,370
- When? - 0632 Eastern Standard.

109
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,940
Triangulated about 60 miles below the Arctic Circle.

110
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:17,850
Near Kazuma.

111
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:18,940
We think it is Erik Heller.

112
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:21,040
- Erik Heller? - You're his handler, right?

113
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,540
Sure, the name sounds familiar.

114
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:27,590


115
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:32,960
Fuck Erik.

116
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,740
Why now?

117
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,260
How does it look?

118
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,070
Good...

119
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,210
Almost good.

120
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,740
Erik Heller, recruited in 1991.

121
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,250
Formal FSK operative.

122
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,480
He became integral to our counter Intelligence Ops

123
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,410
in Eastern europe and Central Asia.

124
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,030
His file ends in '94.

125
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,960
There was no sign of life until April 18, 1996,

126
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,770
when his fingerprints were found on a 22 calibre ruger,

127
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,580


128
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,700
found beside body of one, Johanna Zadek.

129
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,490
Johanna Zadek, born in 1970, German.

130
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:19,700
She was spotted and developed by Heller in 1994.

131
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,690
- Never recruited. - Why was she being developed?

132
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,360
That's not in the file. Let's keep on the past.

133
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,150
Heller is a rogue asset.

134
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,900
I propose we go and pull him out.

135
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,200
We got bigger problems, Marissa.

136
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,800
Let Interpol pick him up.

137
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,770
He's no longer our responsibility.

138
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,700
Interpol nabs him,

139
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,000
that exposes him to BND, FSB, France.

140
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,680


141
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,170
Do you really want every intelligence agency

142
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,970
in Europe scratching at this threat?

143
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,310
- Lewis? - I'm sorry,

144
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,080
but we need to keep this contained, gentlemen.

145
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,320
Keep it small. I've worked with this man.

146
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,160
He knows things I don't think you wanna know.

147
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,490
I appreciate your candor.

148
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:48,700
What do you need Lewis?

149
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,420
One man, one-day operation.

150
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:00,120
- Tell me again. - Marissa Wiegler.

151
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,370
- Then? - Postcard.

152
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,870
- Then? - What?

153
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:03,960
The address where we meet.

154
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,550
Wilhelm Grimm House, Stefan Stra¦Âe,

155
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,520
21610559, Berlin, Germany.

156
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,290
- Then what else? - Adapt or die.

157
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,130
- Think on your feet... - Even when I'm sleeping.

158
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,150
Papa.

159
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,070
Remember what I taught you and you will be fine.

160
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,260
I'll see you there.

161
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:07,860
Macalahan, do you read me?

162
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,600
Macalahan.

163
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,840
Macalahan, do you read me?

164
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,780
Go, go, go.

165
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,210
Erik Heller escaped.

166
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,350
How did that happen?

167
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,660
Unclear. We think he got away in the snow storm or...

168
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,740
And something bigger than that I can manage.

169
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,440
One man, one day of operations.

170
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,790
Just find him, lewis.

171
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,540
Find him and bring him to me.

172
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,180
There was a kid. Things got out of our control!

173
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,100
Wiegler?

174
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,050
Wiegler, are you there?

175
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,970
Where is she now?

176
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,900
Hello, Hanna.

177
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,130
Hello.

178
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,760
My name is Dr. Burton. Would you like to talk to me?

179
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:16,190
I was told by my father to gain the upper hand.

180
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,260
That's very interesting.

181
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,780
What else did your father tell you?

182
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,020
Where am I?

183
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,190
You are in holding.

184
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,030
I've never been in a room like this.

185
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,780
Must all be very strange for you.

186
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,140
How long have you been in the forest?

187
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,710
Hanna?

188
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,960
- Are those cameras? - Uhuh.

189
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,190
They're taking our pictures right now,

190
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:53,940
to keep a record.

191
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,820
How does that make you feel?

192
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,340
Camera obscure...

193
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,160
It's Latin, for dark chamber.

194
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,180
It was first described by the Arabic scientist

195
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,110
Ibn al-Haytham in the year 1021.

196
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,610
Plug the cctv through to Langley.

197
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,610


198
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,770
Hey, you should have a visual on the psych evaluation there.

199
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:16,020
Can I get you something? What do you like?

200
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,030
Music, magazines.

201
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,280
Just ask, anything.

202
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,490
I want to speak to Marissa Wiegler.

203
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,920
- Tell her I'll be there tonight. - I can handle this.

204
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,940
Just do what you're told.

205
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:39,080
John, take a look at this kid's blood sample.

206
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,230
- Is that right? - Is it?

207
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:44,200
- Can't be right. - Got a sample of her hair.

208
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,150
Must be contaminated. Run it again.

209
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,680
My name is Marissa Wiegler.

210
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,980
You wanted to speak with me?

211
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,680
You can wait outside.

212
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,210
Where am I?

213
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,750
You are in a safe place, sweetie.

214
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,270
Where did you meet my father?

215
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:46,730
Erik.

216
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,010
You mean Erik?

217
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,300
Yes.

218
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:57,380
I met him by a news kiosk at Alexander Platz. East Berlin.

219
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,710
I met him at a news kiosk,

220
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,090
- Alexander Platz... - Say it was raining.

221
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,480
in the rain.

222
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:09,470
He'd just arrived from Prague.

223
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,340
He'd just arrived from Prague.

224
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,530
You know where your father is?

225
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,720
Did he tell you where he was going?

226
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,060
We are worried about him.

227
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:31,240
It's okay.

228
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,670
Agent, keep your distance.

229
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:40,410
It's okay.

230
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:43,770
Do you want me to give her something?

231
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,850
I think that might be necessary.

232
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:48,930
Abort.

233
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:52,920
Open up.

234
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,390
I repeat, agent, abort!

235
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:20,580
Wiegler!

236
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,170
Wiegler!

237
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,130
I want everyone here now.

238
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,110
Do not let it escape from the gallery.

239
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:18,410


240
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,040
- Do you think she got out? - She can't get out.

241
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,190
Detail every unit available.

242
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,460


243
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,800


244
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,450
Mama.

245
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,840
She will never be yours.

246
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,660
Hey, hello.

247
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:41,000
Don't you speak English?

248
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,900
It's not your fault if you can't.

249
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:47,120
Emma Ackery couldn't speak English until she was eight,

250
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:50,120
because she was like, a refugee or something from Sri Lanka.

251
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:52,600
But now she's a pop star, in America too.

252
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,800
So don't worry if you can't speak English yet.

253
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,230
Who's she?

254
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,340
I found her, she can't speak English.

255
00:33:58,530 --> 00:33:59,860
She's from Sri Lanka.

256
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,420
I'm from Germany.

257
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,420
I live in Leipzig. Population: 0.7 million peoples.

258
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:09,320
We live at No. 7 Vicenza Platz.

259
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:10,650
I like literature and sport,

260
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,340
in particular tennis and athletics.

261
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:14,720
I go to school at The Klaus College Gymnasium.

262
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:17,620
And my best friends are Rudy Gunter and Clara Scheitz.

263
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,230
They sound fun.

264
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,180
I also have a dog called Trudy.

265
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,790
We had a dog called Vincent,

266
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:24,760
but he went mad and died.

267
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,410
Sophie, come on.

268
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,010
See ya.

269
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:39,020
Sophie, come on.

270
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,430
I'm Sophie and that is my brother, Miles.

271
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,300
I am...Hanna.

272
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:02,610
Do you need a lift somewhere?

273
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,890
No. I prefer to walk.

274
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:08,860
Suit yourself.

275
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,790
Sophie, come on, we are all waiting for you.

276
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,790
Tacticle says she's in the desert,

277
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:20,840
south east of vessel we're in.

278
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,230
Focus all operations on Heller.

279
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,410
Are you saying the girl's not of interest to us?

280
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,030
Yes, of course she's of interest, Lewis.

281
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:27,860
But not an immediate threat

282
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,530
to the security of the United States of America.

283
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,780
Erik Heller is the immediate threat. Focus on Heller.

284
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,560


285
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,540
Where is your family?

286
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,830
- Are you Arabic? - I am Moroccan.

287
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,600
Morocco. Capital city: Rabat.

288
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,170
Places of interest: Marrakech, Essaouira.

289
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,360
Religion: Islam. Language: Arabic.

290
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,600
I like Arabic very much.

291
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,160
It's like Japanese, it's big.

292
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,690
You speak Arabic?

293
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,440
Yes, of course.

294
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,730
Where is your family?

295
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:23,030
I need a room for the night.

296
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,720
Can you help? I have no money.

297
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,520
It's the best we've got.

298
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,580
Thank you.

299
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,580
Do you have one of these in every room?

300
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,990
All the rooms are the same.

301
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:03,950
It's electricity.

302
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:05,660
Of course, all mod cons.

303
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,800
I know a little about electricity.

304
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:13,240
They say Edison invented it.

305
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,560
Or was it Franklin?

306
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,120
Some American I'm sure.

307
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:24,600
This is an electrical kettle.

308
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:27,260
It's for the English.

309
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:29,550
They like to make their own tea.

310
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:47,010
What is it?

311
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,100
It's the best we can do.

312
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,960
Where do you come from?

313
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:02,940
The forest.

314
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,280
It's the German girl.

315
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,050
It's Kraut in a big Djellaba.

316
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,210
Like quail or lesbo.

317
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:25,950
I think I'd quite like to be lesbian.

318
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:28,980
But not one of those fat ones, one who's like, a supermodel.

319
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:32,100
But who don't hold hands, and I think I'd probably marry a man.

320
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:33,950
What?

321
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,470
No kiss?

322
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,590
She's a bit old for you, isn't she?

323
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:25,810
She has male and female genetalias.

324
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,580
And you love her just the way she is.

325
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,380
I like to give people what they want.

326
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,260
Vera, make my friend something sweet.

327
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,170
I'll save it for when I need it.

328
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,790
What do you want, Marissa?

329
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:42,350
Erik Heller's still alive.

330
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:43,520
Of course.

331
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:45,680
And the girl.

332
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,930
Why are you here precisely?

333
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,790
I need you.

334
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:55,390
You need me? Little old me! I'm very flattered.

335
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,070
I need your talents, darling.

336
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,710
I need you to do things

337
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,760
my agency will not let me do.

338
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:03,760
Stop!

339
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,080
Again.

340
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,020
Start again.

341
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:14,950
The devil is in the details, isn't it?

342
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:20,180
It's the girl or Erik?

343
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,440
She is in Morocco.

344
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:22,650
It's all in the envelope.

345
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,340
Let me worry about Erik.

346
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,200
Shall I kill her?

347
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:29,490
Just find her.

348
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,480
Marissa.

349
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:38,620
Did she turn out as you hoped?

350
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:41,560
Better.

351
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:45,960
Once more.

352
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:48,560
Again.

353
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,700
...and gave me lots of advices

354
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:56,000
about how to spend these money do these taxes.

355
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,340
You see even though she is beautiful,

356
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,520
she is actually brilliant with money.

357
00:43:58,710 --> 00:43:59,640
Get off.

358
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:02,650
Like for one of the anniversary, he said his 15 grand,

359
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:04,710
for a Hermes kelly bag or a boob job.

360
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:05,760
Now she said she knew that the

361
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,840
boob implant will have to be replaced every 10 years.

362
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:11,710
But that the Hermes kelly bag never depreciates in value.

363
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:12,510
That's enough for the boob job.

364
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:13,670
I mean that's not just common sense.

365
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,130
And that's why I really love her.

366
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,840
Mum is against plastic surgery.

367
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,740
- I am. - Mum doesn't even wear make-up.

368
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,780
I don't. I think it's dishonest.

369
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:23,900
This is my face, take it or leave it.

370
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,220
If you study History of Art, Anthropology...

371
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:28,710
Rachel got a first at Cambridge.

372
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,790
you'll learn that red lipstick mimics arousal

373
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:32,500
and suggests the geography of the labia minora.

374
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:34,580
- Puke! - Where as I have a lot of natural red pigments

375
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,170
in my lips and so I really don't need it.

376
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,490
- Vomitory - Sophie!

377
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,590
- It's embarrassing. - Just grow up! All right?

378
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:40,500
- Grow up? - Yeah

379
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:41,940
Oh, because yesterday mum was saying

380
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,140
how I shouldn't act beyond my years.

381
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:44,860
No, it does leave her with mixed messages, darling.

382
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:45,920
Because we're trying to

383
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,430
communicate to her how to enjoy childhood.

384
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:50,150
I just want her to stop saying vomitory, all right?

385
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,830
Oi, It's not funny.

386
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:58,740
So, Hanna. Hanna?

387
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,590
I'm quite impressed about you traveling around on your own.

388
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,790
My father encourages me to be independent.

389
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:06,180
You see, that's wonderful.

390
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,130
I was back packing at your age.

391
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:08,180
And where is he, your father?

392
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:11,740
I spent a heavenly summer, just island hopping around Greece.

393
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,540
Island hopping around Greece!

394
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,840
What? No. It's valuable.

395
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,190
Our experience makes us who we are.

396
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:20,330
Isn't that right, kids?

397
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:24,790
So Hanna, is your mum and dad still together?

398
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,170
My mother is dead.

399
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,210
Nice one, dad!

400
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,200
I'm sorry to hear that. I lost my mum when I was very young, so...

401
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,830
It's all right. It happened a long time ago.

402
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,530
Hanna,

403
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,000
what did your mum die of?

404
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:41,610
Three bullets.

405
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,580
Oh my god, That's appalling!

406
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:56,590
Combination of sounds

407
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,350
with a view to beauty of form

408
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,810
and expression of emotion..

409
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:10,480


410
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:16,850
"Abnormal."

411
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:25,790
What happen if it rains?

412
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:27,230
Well, you going to get wet. Aren't you?

413
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:28,870
Because someone broke the sunroof.

414
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:30,970
- The thing is me and your mother are... - Your mother and I...

415
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,010
The thing is me and your mother, your mother and I

416
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,850
are responsible adults... not as you two.

417
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:37,570
My fungus nail infection's back.

418
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:48,110
Who are you?

419
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:49,810
What do you want from the girl?

420
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,730
I am her uncle.

421
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,230
We are very concerned about her.

422
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:57,220
I don't know what you're looking for.

423
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:01,040
She came, she was nice, she left.

424
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,020
Bingo!

425
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:07,160
Voila!

426
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:13,250
The van has checked out?

427
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:14,820
Today.

428
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:16,830
North or south?

429
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,070
The ferry. They caugh the ferry to Spain.

430
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,380
Can you lend me your pen?

431
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:42,590
I've contacted Interpol.

432
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:43,680
On whose authority?

433
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,960
Walt. We can't keep this to ourselves anymore.

434
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,860
- Were you not listening? - He killed two policemen.

435
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:51,960
He's reframed the situation. It is out of our control.

436
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:54,800
Then we must regain control, Mr. Lewis.

437
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,270
I am the first and the last person Erik Heller will see.

438
00:49:58,470 --> 00:49:59,420
Are we clear?

439
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,480
Are we clear?

440
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:05,750
- Mr. Lewis? - Yes, madam.

441
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:23,030


442
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,790
Oh, my god! What are you doing here?

443
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:12,930
The sunroof, was it you?

444
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:14,990
Would it be very bad if it was?

445
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:17,390
You mean you were in the van, the whole time?

446
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:20,410
My dad would have a heart attack if he found out.

447
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:23,440
- Will you have to tell him? - Hanna, you are so mental!

448
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:25,450
Of course I'm not going to tell him.

449
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:27,440
I think it's brilliant.

450
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:30,410
- Have you got anywhere to stay? - No.

451
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,370
Yes, you do. You're staying with me.

452
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:33,580
I am?

453
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:34,740
Yeah, obviously.

454
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:36,880
I'm sneaking you in, on one condition.

455
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:38,090
What?

456
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:43,000
These boys. Spanish. Gorgeous.

457
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,500
No, don't look. Don't go all pruny about it, like footballers.

458
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:50,550
Haven't got their eyebrows waxed, or anything!

459
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,980
- Good. - Anyway, we're going out tonight and you have to come.

460
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:57,440
- All right. -God, you're not hard to convince! Perv.

461
00:52:57,810 --> 00:52:58,850
Who?

462
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,440
Have you got anything to wear?

463
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:06,170
You can't wear those, you look like some mad German.

464
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:17,100
Are you scared?

465
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:18,810
Of what?

466
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:11,300
Are we going to kiss now?

467
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,300
Would you like to?

468
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:24,440
Kissing requires a total of 34 facial muscles

469
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:27,780
and 112 postural muscles.

470
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:31,470
The most important muscle involved

471
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:33,340
is the orbicularis oris muscle,

472
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:36,680
because it is used to pucker the lips.

473
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:55,910
Hanna, you mentalist!

474
00:56:56,130 --> 00:56:59,280
Please tell your friend I wanted just a kiss.

475
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,870
Hanna!

476
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:04,180
- Should I let him go? - As opposed to what?

477
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:06,120
Yes, you should let him go!

478
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,770
I'm going to go now.

479
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:14,080
Okay.

480
00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:16,750
It was nice.

481
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:54,730
Sophie, is that you?

482
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:57,790
It is the sandman.

483
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:00,200
Go to sleep.

484
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:20,650
Oh, my god. You acted like a bandit. It's embarrassing.

485
00:58:20,850 --> 00:58:22,960
- Like what? - Oh, I can't believe you.

486
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:39,720
Hello, mama.

487
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:42,900
I know you're disappointed in me.

488
00:58:43,110 --> 00:58:46,260
I know it. I am very sorry, Mama.

489
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:51,280
But... But maybe I've found a way to make it better.

490
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,240
I'm in a programme now.

491
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:57,070
A programme to make babies stronger.

492
00:58:57,790 --> 00:59:00,540
It's an American programme, very scien...

493
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,170
How did you get into my house, Mrs. Wiegler?

494
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:06,740
I'm looking for Erik.

495
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:13,840
He said you were dead.

496
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:16,620
So you've seen him?

497
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:22,060
He sent word.

498
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,030
Where is Hanna?

499
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:34,630
Did you ever have children of your own?

500
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:40,120
I made certain choices.

501
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:44,410
Then you will never understand

502
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:45,880
what it is like to lose your child,

503
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,570
to not know what happened.

504
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,150
The years of waiting,

505
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:02,190
of watching from the window.

506
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:04,710
And waiting...

507
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,300
Waiting...

508
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:31,330
Have you seen her?

509
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:33,460
Hanna!

510
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,240
Can you tell me what she looks like?

511
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,280
Like her mother.

512
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:50,230
- Hanna? - Yes.

513
01:00:50,910 --> 01:00:52,160
Where do you really come from?

514
01:00:54,090 --> 01:00:57,000
Leipzig. I live in Leipzig.

515
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,580
If we're going to be friends,

516
01:00:58,770 --> 01:00:59,730
you're going to have to be honest with me.

517
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:01,310
Those are the rules.

518
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:05,290
- Are we friends? - Yes.

519
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:07,040
I like you.

520
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,290
I'd like to have a friend.

521
01:01:12,550 --> 01:01:14,730
I mean, you're a freak and everything, but I like you.

522
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,660
I like you too. I really do.

523
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:20,960
But.

524
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:23,560
There are things I can't tell you.

525
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:27,410
- Do you understand? - Yes

526
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:31,010
Actually, no, I don't.

527
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:34,650
There are peoples that want to harm me.

528
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:37,810
- Bad peoples. - I see.

529
01:01:38,170 --> 01:01:40,330
- And they won't stop. - Right.

530
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:43,140
So, for your own safety.

531
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:48,870
Can we still be friends?

532
01:01:49,690 --> 01:01:50,970
I don't know.

533
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,710
I mean I don't really know who you are, do I?

534
01:01:55,410 --> 01:01:56,450
That's just it.

535
01:01:58,390 --> 01:01:59,300
Neither do I.

536
01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:07,860
- What is it? - It's something about me.

537
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:14,080
I know what DNA means, but I don't understand the rest of it.

538
01:02:14,290 --> 01:02:16,770
- Are you sick? - I don't feel sick.

539
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:19,590
- What's wrong with you? - Nothing's wrong with me.

540
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:23,350
What are you going to do?

541
01:02:27,230 --> 01:02:28,390
I'm going to Berlin.

542
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:32,270
I have to meet meet my father at the House of Wilhelm Grimm.

543
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:34,350
From Grimms fairy tales?

544
01:02:34,970 --> 01:02:36,160
That's right.

545
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:37,890
If you say so.

546
01:02:38,510 --> 01:02:39,970
Did I say the wrong thing again?

547
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:49,120
Keep this.

548
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:51,070
To remember me.

549
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:54,910
It's a friendship bracelet.

550
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:01,930
Thank you.

551
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:43,620
Where's Hanna?

552
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,050
Wow, you look rough! Do want some tea?

553
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:47,600
I had some. Who's Hanna?

554
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:49,500
The girl we ate dinner with in Morocco.

555
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:52,040
She's here, or was. She came out with me last night.

556
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,240
How did she get here? Is she with her father?

557
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:55,760
No, she came on her own.

558
01:03:56,610 --> 01:03:57,600
What?

559
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,030
Look, other people have their own style of parenting.

560
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:02,390
He's promoting independence.

561
01:04:02,590 --> 01:04:04,460
She's like an orphan! Call me conservative.

562
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:06,820
- Are you really conservative, darling? - No, I'm not.

563
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:08,500
I said we'll give her a lift to Lyon.

564
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:09,960
We are going to Lyon, aren't we?

565
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:12,150
I found breakfast.

566
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,610
That's gross!

567
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:49,110
We've got him! We have Heller.

568
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,840
Do you read me? Bring him to Wiegler.

569
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:24,720
She will id an interview.

570
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:25,960
Is that what she said?

571
01:07:26,190 --> 01:07:27,860
Confirmed with her two minutes ago.

572
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,320
Marissa, damn it!

573
01:07:58,410 --> 01:08:00,950
I feel so grounded in the countryside.

574
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:05,390
The city stifles me,

575
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:08,660
emotionally, creatively, spiritually.

576
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:13,110
Places like this bring us closer to God.

577
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,330
God?

578
01:08:15,570 --> 01:08:17,810
Well, not any modernistic sense.

579
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:21,470
Buddha, Krishna, the God within.

580
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:21,470


581
01:08:22,450 --> 01:08:23,530
Whatever you believe in.

582
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:29,680
What do you believe in, Hanna?

583
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:35,190
Nothing.

584
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:46,250
Everything alright?

585
01:08:49,890 --> 01:08:50,660
I think so.

586
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:25,000
I'm not sure if it's true that the baby can hear me,

587
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:27,220
but at night I feel her.

588
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:29,230
I hope she hears me.

589
01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:31,910
Was it like this for you, mama?

590
01:09:32,370 --> 01:09:34,960
I think I know what she looks like.

591
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:37,610
I can see her when I close my eyes.

592
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:41,820
I can hear her inside me. Movings.

593
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:46,000
Do you think is that silly? Oh, I think it's a girl.

594
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:48,070
I hope so.

595
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:51,610
Erik ...

596
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:53,200
What?

597
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:56,130
Oh for Christ's sake, Lewis.

598
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,600
Hello, Marissa.

599
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:01,670
I heard you were dead.

600
01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:04,540
Did your little girl tell you that?

601
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:08,060
- What are you listening to? - Self help.

602
01:10:09,390 --> 01:10:10,780
Are you in need of help?

603
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,760
It's good to hear you.

604
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:15,160


605
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:16,700
I didn't imagine we'd have the chance to talk.

606
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:19,320
You don't have her, do you? You're not that good.

607
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,720
Oh, Erik! You're such a flirt.

608
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:25,770
Tech's on the way.

609
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,570
You were a good agent, Erik.

610
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:30,840
Sad to see you go dumb.

611
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:34,740
What did I miss?

612
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:36,550
I couldn't do it anymore.

613
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:38,230
The things we did.

614
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,980
I... I'm sorry with Johanna.

615
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:45,220
With all of them. With Hanna.

616
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:48,300
So, why come back now?

617
01:10:50,050 --> 01:10:50,870
Tech guys.

618
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,180
I asked you a question, Erik?

619
01:10:56,190 --> 01:10:58,320
Erik, are you still there?

620
01:11:38,230 --> 01:11:39,840
Move. Get up.

621
01:12:09,820 --> 01:12:13,110
Shit ... shit ... shit ...

622
01:12:14,290 --> 01:12:15,640
Hanna, I think we're lost.

623
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:25,590
- I have to pull over. - No, don't.

624
01:12:25,790 --> 01:12:26,870
Can't see the map.

625
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,480
Have we stopped? I need to pee.

626
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:48,190
Don't want you going too far right now, love.

627
01:12:48,550 --> 01:12:50,180
I think you should stay where you are, Sophie.

628
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:51,480
Hanna, what's going on?

629
01:12:57,390 --> 01:12:58,640
Keep calm.

630
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:13,850
- Are we are in Lyon? - No, we're not.

631
01:13:15,230 --> 01:13:17,690
Whatever you do, don't follow me!

632
01:13:18,450 --> 01:13:19,820
Promise not to follow me.

633
01:13:20,490 --> 01:13:21,650
I promise.

634
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:34,000
Thank you for being my friend.

635
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:37,420
Hanna!

636
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:38,870
Come on, come on!

637
01:13:43,670 --> 01:13:45,780
Silence! Shut up!

638
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:21,340
Hanna.

639
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:45,660
Definitely odd. Disconnected.

640
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:49,990
You know, I like to think that I have a rapport with kids.

641
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:52,020
You know, I get with them.

642
01:17:53,990 --> 01:17:55,740
You know, sir, it's days like this

643
01:17:55,930 --> 01:17:57,250
that I really hate my job.

644
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:59,270
Yeah, I'm sure you do.

645
01:17:59,710 --> 01:18:01,770
This is very, very difficult.

646
01:18:03,770 --> 01:18:06,510
But sometimes children are bad people too.

647
01:18:06,730 --> 01:18:09,520
- Stop crying. - I'm not telling you anything!

648
01:18:09,710 --> 01:18:11,170
- Do you know this boy? - No!

649
01:18:11,370 --> 01:18:14,850
He knows you. Your friend is in a lot of danger.

650
01:18:15,070 --> 01:18:16,490
I don't know anything!

651
01:18:17,550 --> 01:18:19,050
She said she lived in Leipzig.

652
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:21,310
She went to The Klaus College Gymnazium.

653
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,880
Her friends were Rudy and Gunter

654
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:25,500
She likes tennis and she has a dog named Trudy.

655
01:18:25,710 --> 01:18:27,990
- She lied to you. - Absolutely.

656
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:29,710
She is not lost.

657
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:31,310
But she needed taken care of.

658
01:18:32,050 --> 01:18:34,030
I've got something to show you.

659
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:36,850
- A little help from mom. - This is Hanna's mother.

660
01:18:37,070 --> 01:18:38,230
Biological mother.

661
01:18:38,790 --> 01:18:41,120
15 years ago, she was shot to death

662
01:18:41,310 --> 01:18:43,250
by Hanna's father on a camping trip.

663
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,350
Don't you wanna see what's inside?

664
01:18:49,930 --> 01:18:52,090
- Say "Please." - Please.

665
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,650
You like her, don't you?

666
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:25,320
It's okay. I won't tell anyone.

667
01:19:27,010 --> 01:19:28,070
She's very pretty.

668
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:31,570
- Where is she? - You tell me.

669
01:19:32,130 --> 01:19:33,320
Is she in lots of trouble?

670
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,330
The worst kind, sweetheart.

671
01:19:35,690 --> 01:19:37,670
Some very bad men are looking for her,

672
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:39,410
and I need to find her. I wanna protect her.

673
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:47,530
Do you want her to get hurt?

674
01:19:48,810 --> 01:19:49,740
No.

675
01:19:51,150 --> 01:19:54,400
She's going to Berlin. To Wilhelm Grimm's house.

676
01:19:54,830 --> 01:19:56,070
To meet her dad.

677
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:43,340
Hanna. Hanna ... Hanna come, come.

678
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:46,490
This way.

679
01:21:51,850 --> 01:21:53,590
Been waiting for you a long time.

680
01:21:55,690 --> 01:21:57,540
What did Erik told you about me?

681
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,400
Wilhelm Grimm's House Stefan Stra¦Âe,

682
01:22:00,620 --> 01:22:03,090
21610559, Berlin, Germany.

683
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:05,380
That's it.

684
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:10,260
He didn't tell you of my magic.

685
01:22:22,030 --> 01:22:23,660
Klaus, 09/05. Be there Tuesday. Erik.

686
01:22:26,130 --> 01:22:28,330
- What day is it? - It's today, my dear.

687
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:30,770
Come, come.

688
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:45,950
Sit.

689
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:48,800
Oh, you're hungry.

690
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:59,730
- Waffles. - May I have one?

691
01:22:59,950 --> 01:23:01,840
An egg? Of course.

692
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:05,870
You can eat whatever you want, my dear.

693
01:23:06,260 --> 01:23:07,370
My shoe!

694
01:23:08,070 --> 01:23:09,750
Oh, I've almost forgotten.

695
01:23:15,370 --> 01:23:16,190
A present.

696
01:23:19,340 --> 01:23:20,050
For me?

697
01:23:24,590 --> 01:23:26,040
You will need a fresh photograph.

698
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:27,540
But everything's in order, yes?

699
01:23:27,780 --> 01:23:30,360
Why do I need a piece of paper to tell me my name?

700
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:32,430
Not you, not you, my dear.

701
01:23:32,630 --> 01:23:36,340
But everyone else we need paper and computers,

702
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:37,920
so we don't have to ask people their names

703
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:39,500
to look them in the face.

704
01:23:44,090 --> 01:23:45,240
You have a good face.

705
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:47,910
You look just like your father.

706
01:23:49,010 --> 01:23:51,790
And you walk like him too, uh uh uh.

707
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:53,270
I don't walk like that.

708
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:55,800
Yes, you do! You do, my dear! Uh uh.

709
01:24:03,050 --> 01:24:04,580
Did you know my mother too?

710
01:24:06,790 --> 01:24:07,760
Of course.

711
01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:13,480
She was a singer. A wonderful singer.

712
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:16,900
Do you sing?

713
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:21,230
Papa.. Erik, didn't teach me.

714
01:24:21,510 --> 01:24:22,920
Oh, you poor child.

715
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:26,820
He has truely limited you from all the wonderful things

716
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:28,540
the world has to offer.

717
01:24:29,190 --> 01:24:30,630
No magic.

718
01:24:31,790 --> 01:24:33,340
No music.

719
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:03,040
I'll teach you.

720
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:08,890
Is that him?

721
01:25:13,610 --> 01:25:15,840
Upstairs with you, my dear. Quickly.

722
01:25:29,220 --> 01:25:30,070
Good day.

723
01:25:31,350 --> 01:25:33,630
We're closed, boys and girls.

724
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:40,440
Where is Erik?

725
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:23,740
He doesn't know much

726
01:26:24,660 --> 01:26:26,090
or he is a very good liar.

727
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:28,350
He knew Johanna.

728
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:29,460
Yes, of course.

729
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:31,220
Bits and pieces about the programme.

730
01:26:31,630 --> 01:26:32,950
What does he know about the girl?

731
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:34,890
He thinks Erik's the father.

732
01:26:36,190 --> 01:26:38,950
- Everybody thinks Erik's the father. - That's precious!

733
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:42,620
Yes? This is Marissa Wiegler.

734
01:26:44,150 --> 01:26:45,460
Walt, I didn't recog....

735
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:46,630
Lewis is dead.

736
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:48,760
Do you think it's important to tell us?

737
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:50,700
Why didn't you call us yet?

738
01:26:50,910 --> 01:26:53,810
One man, one-day operation.

739
01:26:56,830 --> 01:26:59,020
Yes. Yes. Yes! We all want Lewis.

740
01:27:02,620 --> 01:27:04,210
He was shooting through the door, Walt.

741
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:08,450
No, I'm not standing down...

742
01:27:10,310 --> 01:27:11,310
No, I'm interest..

743
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:17,490
Well, yes. That is time.

744
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:24,330
No, listen, Walt.

745
01:28:09,110 --> 01:28:10,240


746
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:14,670


747
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:19,880


748
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:24,400


749
01:28:26,630 --> 01:28:27,430


750
01:28:56,280 --> 01:28:57,170
Heizinger.

751
01:29:16,890 --> 01:29:18,710
So off to grandmother's house, we go.

752
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:26,980
Have you seen her?

753
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:29,060
Hanna!

754
01:30:44,150 --> 01:30:44,930
Sit down.

755
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:49,870
Are you my father?

756
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:52,990
Sit down, Hanna.

757
01:30:53,170 --> 01:30:55,230
- Are you my father? - Please, sit.

758
01:30:55,420 --> 01:30:56,430
Are you?

759
01:30:57,010 --> 01:30:59,860
Hanna, of course I'm your father.

760
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:03,290
- I raised you. - But Marissa said ...

761
01:31:03,470 --> 01:31:05,110
- Hanna! - Don't lie to me!

762
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:10,240
I'm your father. I've been with you your whole life.

763
01:31:11,230 --> 01:31:13,060
Treated you like my own flesh and blood.

764
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:14,920
But I was not your flesh and blood.

765
01:31:17,270 --> 01:31:18,730
- I am abnormal? - No!

766
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:20,330
Where was I born?

767
01:31:24,340 --> 01:31:25,590
Tell me the truth.

768
01:31:28,620 --> 01:31:30,560
You were born in a research facility.

769
01:31:31,510 --> 01:31:33,030
In rural Poland, Galinki.

770
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:36,260
What was the research?

771
01:31:37,220 --> 01:31:38,670
They took fertilized embryos

772
01:31:38,860 --> 01:31:40,940
and made small changes to them to improve them.

773
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:44,530
To reduce the capacity for fear, for pity,

774
01:31:44,870 --> 01:31:46,550
to increase muscle strength,

775
01:31:47,220 --> 01:31:50,310
heightened senses. Anything to make a better soldier.

776
01:31:51,090 --> 01:31:52,380
The perfect soldier.

777
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:58,490
I've recruited your mother in an abortion clinic.

778
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:01,510
I've recruited twenty women the same way.

779
01:32:05,870 --> 01:32:08,540
- There were other children? - Yes.

780
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:11,500
When you were two,

781
01:32:11,780 --> 01:32:13,880
Marissa Wiegler, she closed the whole programme

782
01:32:14,120 --> 01:32:15,660
and all of this research,

783
01:32:17,250 --> 01:32:18,900
it was disposed of.

784
01:32:19,530 --> 01:32:20,750
Do you understand?

785
01:32:26,130 --> 01:32:29,310
I love you, Hanna. You have to know that.

786
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,680
Because I'm a freak?

787
01:32:35,940 --> 01:32:37,020
No.

788
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:39,980
Because you are my child.

789
01:32:48,380 --> 01:32:49,480
Where are you going?

790
01:32:52,330 --> 01:32:53,110
Stop this.

791
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:54,730
Let me go!

792
01:33:09,820 --> 01:33:10,620
Stop this.

793
01:33:23,450 --> 01:33:25,180
Hanna! Hanna, please!

794
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:30,540
I tried to prepare you for what your life'd be.

795
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:32,920
You didn't prepare me for this.

796
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:38,460
Run!

797
01:33:40,340 --> 01:33:41,100
Run!

798
01:33:51,770 --> 01:33:52,520
Take it.

799
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:11,190
That's all you got?

800
01:34:13,660 --> 01:34:15,530
Run, pig!

801
01:36:14,630 --> 01:36:16,400
Why now, Erik?

802
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:21,990
Kids grow up.

803
01:36:57,650 --> 01:36:58,600
Mr. Grimm!

804
01:37:01,630 --> 01:37:02,420
Mr. Grimm.

805
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:17,960
Hanna

806
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:33,860
I'm here, Hanna.

807
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:04,480
Oh, don't worry sweetheart.

808
01:40:04,670 --> 01:40:07,370
Don't! Don't move any closer!

809
01:40:10,050 --> 01:40:13,200
Hanna, I can help you.

810
01:40:13,720 --> 01:40:14,780
Please!

811
01:40:16,240 --> 01:40:18,210
I don't want to hurt anyone anymore..

812
01:40:19,810 --> 01:40:21,980
I just wanna talk.

813
01:40:23,530 --> 01:40:24,990
It's over now, Marissa.

814
01:40:29,270 --> 01:40:30,690
Let me go.

815
01:40:32,660 --> 01:40:33,700
Hanna!

816
01:40:35,410 --> 01:40:37,570
Don't walk away from me, young lady!

817
01:43:11,190 --> 01:43:12,800
I just missed your heart
