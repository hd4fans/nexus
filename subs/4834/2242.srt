它能告诉玛丽莎・维格拉我们的方位

73
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,640

74
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,970
只需打开开关就行

我不会替你做决定
I won't be there to hold your hand.

79
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,790
自己考虑清楚

80
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,380
想清楚这是不是你的真正所想
Be sure it's what you really want.

81

它就在这  不急  要想清楚

也是第一只绕地飞行的动物

85
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,800

86
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,880
无法忍受外太空的环境
would be unable to survive the conditions of outer space.

87
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,930
因此动物的航天飞行就成了
So flights by animals were used

88
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,840
人类探索外太空的先驱实验
as experiments precursory to human missions.

89
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,050
那时的火箭是不可回收式的
A rocket was not designed to be retrievable,

90
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:32,000
莱卡就是去送命的
and Laika has always been, intended to die.

91
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,850
但她没死  对吗
But she didn't, did she?

92
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,390
还记得吗  他们无法收回火箭
They couldn't bring the rocket back, remember?

93
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,700
记得
I remember.

94
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,020
但有时我希望你能换种方式看问题
But sometimes I wish you would read it differently.

95

当一颗行星瓦解时
When a star collapses,

96
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,580
超新星爆炸所发出的光
the supernova explosion is ten billion times

97
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,380
要比其他行星要亮百亿倍

98
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,380
和我一起去打猎吗

103
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:52,870
好  好吧
Yes, good.

104
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,100
玛丽莎・维格拉

你很幸运能猎到那头鹿

00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:20,840
在我们的东南方
south east of vessel we're in.

282
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,230
全力追捕海勒
Focus all operations on Heller.

283
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,410
你的意思是这女孩对我们没价值吗
Are you saying the girl's not of interest to us?

284
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,030
她当然有用  路易斯
Yes, of course she's of interest, Lewis.

285
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:27,860
但她还不会
But not an immediate threat

286
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,530
对美国的安全构成直接威胁
to the security of the United States of America.

287
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,780
埃里克・海勒是眼下最危险的人物  以他为重
Erik Heller is the immediate threat. Focus on Heller.

288
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,560
鲁拜宾馆

289
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,540
你的家人呢
Where is your family?

290
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,830
-你是阿拉伯人吗  -我是摩洛哥人
- Are you Arabic? - I am Moroccan.

291
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,600
摩洛哥  首都是拉巴特
Morocco. Capital city: Rabat.

292
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,170
著名景点包括马拉喀什和索维拉
Places of interest: Marrakech, Essaouira.

293
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,360
信奉伊斯兰教  语种为阿拉伯语
Religion: Islam. Language: Arabic.

294
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,600
我很喜欢阿拉伯语
I like Arabic very much.

295
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,160
像日语一样  是个丰富的语言
It's like Japanese, it's big.

296
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,690
你会说阿拉伯语吗
You speak Arabic?

297
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,440
当然会说
Yes, of course.

298
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,730
你的家人在哪儿
Where is your family?

299
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:23,030
我今晚要找个地方住
I need a room for the night.

300
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,720
但我没钱  你能帮帮我吗
Can you help? I have no money.

301
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,520
这是我们这儿最好的房间
It's the best we've got.

302
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,580
谢谢
Thank you.

303
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,580
每个房间都有这东西吗
Do you have one of these in every room?

304
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,990
所有的房间都有
All the rooms are the same.

305
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:03,950
是电
It's electricity.

306
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:05,660
还用说吗  都是现代化设备
Of course, all mod cons.

307
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,800
我对电知之甚少
I know a little about electricity.

308
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:13,240
人们说是爱迪生发明了电
They say Edison invented it.

309
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,560
还是富兰克林来着
Or was it Franklin?

310
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,120
反正是个美国人
Some American I'm sure.

311
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:24,600
这个是电热水壶
This is an electrical kettle.

312
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:27,260
专为英国人准备的
It's for the English.

313
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:29,550
他们喜欢自己烧水沏茶
They like to make their own tea.

314
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:47,010
这是什么
What is it?

315
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,100
有这就够不错的了
It's the best we can do.

316
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,960
你从哪儿来
Where do you come from?

317
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:02,940
森林
The forest.

318
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,280
是那个德国女孩
It's the German girl.

319
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,050
穿摩洛哥宽长袍的德国佬
It's Kraut in a big Djellaba.

320
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,210
即像雏妓又像拉拉
Like quail or lesbo.

321
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:25,950
我觉得当个拉拉也挺不错的
I think I'd quite like to be lesbian.

322
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:28,980
但我的恋人不能太胖  得像模特一样
But not one of those fat ones, one who's like, a supermodel.

323
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:32,100
但也只是玩玩儿  我应该还是会嫁个男人
But who don't hold hands, and I think I'd probably marry a man.

324
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:33,950
什么
What?

325
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,470
不亲一个吗
No kiss?

326
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,590
她对你来说有点太老了吧
She's a bit old for you, isn't she?

327
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:25,810
她是个人妖
She has male and female genetalias.

328
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,580
这就是你为之倾倒的原因吧
And you love her just the way she is.

329
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,380
我很乐意满足他人的需求
I like to give people what they want.

330
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,260
薇拉  给我朋友来杯美酒
Vera, make my friend something sweet.

331
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,170
还是下次吧
I'll save it for when I need it.

332
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,790
你为何而来  玛丽莎
What do you want, Marissa?

333
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:42,350
埃里克・海勒还活着
Erik Heller's still alive.

334
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:43,520
意料之中
Of course.

335
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:45,680
还有那个女孩
And the girl.

336
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,930
你到底为什么来这里
Why are you here precisely?

337
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,790
我需要你
I need you.

338
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:55,390
需要我这个不中用的老家伙  真是受宠若惊
You need me? Little old me! I'm very flattered.

339
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,070
我需要你的聪明才智  亲爱的
I need your talents, darling.

340
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,710
我需要你帮我做点
I need you to do things

341
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,760
情报局不允许的事情
my agency will not let me do.

342
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:03,760
停
Stop!

343
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,080
重来
Again.

344
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,020
从头来
Start again.

345
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:14,950
细节决定成败  不是吗
The devil is in the details, isn't it?

346
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:20,180
解决那个女孩还是埃里克
It's the girl or Erik?

347
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,440
她就在摩洛哥
She is in Morocco.

348
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:22,650
你需要的都在信封里
It's all in the envelope.

349
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,340
埃里克就交给我吧
Let me worry about Erik.

350
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,200
要杀死她吗
Shall I kill her?

351
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:29,490
找到她就好
Just find her.

352
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,480
玛丽莎
Marissa.

353
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:38,620
她跟你预想的一样吗
Did she turn out as you hoped?

354
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:41,560
比我想的还要好
Better.

355
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:45,960
重来一遍
Once more.

356
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:48,560
再来一次
Again.

357
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,700
还告诉我许多
...and gave me lots of advices

358
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:56,000
关于如何花钱避税的建议
about how to spend these money do these taxes.

359
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,340
虽然她很漂亮
You see even though she is beautiful,

360
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,520
但还是很会精打细算
she is actually brilliant with money.

361
00:43:58,710 --> 00:43:59,640
别碰我
Get off.

362
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:02,650
比如有次纪念日  他说有1万5千块
Like for one of the anniversary, he said his 15 grand,

363
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:04,710
是买个爱马仕凯莉包还是做个隆胸手术呢
for a Hermes kelly bag or a boob job.

364
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:05,760
而她却知道  
Now she said she knew that the

365
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,840
乳房假体每十年就要更换一次
boob implant will have to be replaced every 10 years.

366
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:11,710
而爱马仕凯莉包可是永不贬值
But that the Hermes kelly bag never depreciates in value.

367
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:12,510
隆胸就说到这儿吧
That's enough for the boob job.

368
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:13,670
可不是谁都懂这些的
I mean that's not just common sense.

369
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,130
所以我才喜欢她
And that's why I really love her.

370
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,840
我妈反对整形
Mum is against plastic surgery.

371
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,740
-没错  -甚至连化妆都很少
- I am. - Mum doesn't even wear make-up.

372
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,780
对  我觉得那很虚伪
I don't. I think it's dishonest.

373
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:23,900
这就是我的样子  不喜欢拉倒
This is my face, take it or leave it.

374
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,220
如果你学过美术史和人类学的话
If you study History of Art, Anthropology...

375
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:28,710
瑞秋是剑桥的优等生
Rachel got a first at Cambridge.

376
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,790
你就会学到红唇能刺激性欲
you'll learn that red lipstick mimics arousal

377
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:32,500
且能使人联想起小阴唇的形状
and suggests the geography of the labia minora.

378
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:34,580
-恶心  -而我的嘴唇红得很自然
- Puke! - Where as I have a lot of natural red pigments

379
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,170
所以我根本不需要涂口红
in my lips and so I really don't need it.

380
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,490
-太恶心了  -索菲
- Vomitory - Sophie!

381
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,590
-真难为情  -别老跟个孩子似的好吗
- It's embarrassing. - Just grow up! All right?

382
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:40,500
-别跟个孩子似的  -对
- Grow up? - Yeah

383
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:41,940
可是昨天妈妈还让我 
Oh, because yesterday mum was saying

384
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,140
别像个小大人似的
how I shouldn't act beyond my years.

385
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:44,860
她确实被弄糊涂了  亲爱的
No, it does leave her with mixed messages, darling.

386
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:45,920
因为咱们都想告诉她
Because we're trying to

387
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,430
如何过个快乐的童年
communicate to her how to enjoy childhood.

388
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:50,150
我只想让她别再说恶心
I just want her to stop saying vomitory, all right?

389
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,830
这可不好笑
Oi, It's not funny.

390
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:58,740
汉娜  汉娜
So, Hanna. Hanna?

391
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,590
我很佩服你这么小就独自旅行
I'm quite impressed about you traveling around on your own.

392
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,790
我父亲鼓励我学会自立
My father encourages me to be independent.

393
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:06,180
真不错
You see, that's wonderful.

394
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,130
我在你这年纪的时候也是个背包客
I was back packing at your age.

395
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:08,180
那你父亲人呢
And where is he, your father?

396
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:11,740
我花了整整一个美妙的夏天环游希腊
I spent a heavenly summer, just island hopping around Greece.

397
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,540
环游希腊
Island hopping around Greece!

398
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,840
怎么了  挺好的  真的
What? No. It's valuable.

399
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,190
不同的阅历造就了不同的人  
Our experience makes us who we are.

400
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:20,330
对吗  孩子们
Isn't that right, kids?

401
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:24,790
汉娜  你父母还在一起吗
So Hanna, is your mum and dad still together?

402
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,170
我母亲去世了
My mother is dead.

403
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,210
瞧你问的  老爸
Nice one, dad!

404
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,200
真替你难过  我母亲也在我小时候就去世了
I'm sorry to hear that. I lost my mum when I was very young, so...

405
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,830
没关系  很久以前的事了
It's all right. It happened a long time ago.

406
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,530
汉娜
Hanna,

407
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,000
你妈妈怎么去世的
what did your mum die of?

408
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:41,610
三发子弹
Three bullets.

409
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,580
天呐  太可怕了
Oh my god, That's appalling!

410
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:56,590
声音的组合
Combination of sounds

411
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,350
一种表达美
with a view to beauty of form

412
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,810
和思想感情的艺术
and expression of emotion..

413
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:10,480
检验报告

414
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:16,850
异常
"Abnormal."

415
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:25,790
万一下雨了呢
What happen if it rains?

416
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:27,230
那你就要淋湿了呗
Well, you going to get wet. Aren't you?

417
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:28,870
因为天窗被人打破了
Because someone broke the sunroof.

418
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:30,970
-你妈和我  -是你父母
- The thing is me and your mother are... - Your mother and I...

419
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,010
你妈和我  你父母
The thing is me and your mother, your mother and I

420
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,850
都是成年人  不像你们俩
are responsible adults... not as you two.

421
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:37,570
我的指甲又感染了
My fungus nail infection's back.

422
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:48,110
你是谁
Who are you?

423
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:49,810
你们找那个女孩干什么
What do you want from the girl?

424
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,730
我是她的舅舅
I am her uncle.

425
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,230
我们都很担心她
We are very concerned about her.

426
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:57,220
我不知道你到底要找什么
I don't know what you're looking for.

427
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:01,040
她来过  很友善  然后就离开了
She came, she was nice, she left.

428
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,020
说对了
Bingo!

429
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:07,160
可不是嘛
Voila!

430
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:13,250
车上的人已经结账走了吗
The van has checked out?

431
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:14,820
今天刚走

432
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:16,830
往北还是往南去了
North or south?

433
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,070
去渡口了  他们要坐渡轮去西班牙
The ferry. They caugh the ferry to Spain.

434
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,380
借你的笔用一下行吗
Can you lend me your pen?

435
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:42,590
我已经联系了国际刑警
I've contacted Interpol.

436
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:43,680
谁给你的权利
On whose authority?

437
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,960
沃特  我们不能再隐瞒下去了
Walt. We can't keep this to ourselves anymore.

438
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,860
-你没听我说吗  -他杀了两个警察
- Were you not listening? - He killed two policemen.

439
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:51,960
情况变复杂了  我们已无法控制
He's reframed the situation. It is out of our control.

440
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:54,800
那就让一切重回掌控之中  路易斯先生
Then we must regain control, Mr. Lewis.

441
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,270
除了我没人能再见到埃里克・海勒
I am the first and the last person Erik Heller will see.

442
00:49:58,470 --> 00:49:59,420
懂了吗
Are we clear?

443
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,480
你听懂了吗
Are we clear?

444
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:05,750

445
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:23,030
巫婆死了

446
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,790
天呐  你怎么在这里
Oh, my god! What are you doing here?

447
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:12,930
天窗是你打破的吧
The sunroof, was it you?

448
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:14,990
我是不是不该这么做
Would it be very bad if it was?

449
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:17,390
也就是说你一直都在我们的车上
You mean you were in the van, the whole time?

450
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:20,410
要是我爸知道了一定会犯心脏病的
My dad would have a heart attack if he found out.

451
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:23,440
-你会告诉他吗  -汉娜  你疯了吗
- Will you have to tell him? - Hanna, you are so mental!

452
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:25,450
我当然不会告诉他
Of course I'm not going to tell him.

453
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:27,440
我觉得你很厉害

454
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:30,410
-那你有地方待吗  -没有
- Have you got anywhere to stay? - No.

455
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,370
现在有了  你可以跟我待在一起

456
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:33,580
可以吗

457
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:34,740
当然可以
Yeah, obviously.

458
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:36,880
我可以把你藏起来  但你得答应我一个条件
I'm sneaking you in, on one condition.

459
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:38,090
什么条件
What?

460
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:43,000
那些西班牙男孩  帅极了
These boys. Spanish. Gorgeous.

461
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,500
不  别回头  他们像球员一样皮肤健康
No, don't look. Don't go all pruny about it, like footballers.

462
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:50,550
也没有修眉什么的
Haven't got their eyebrows waxed, or anything!

463
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,980
-好  -总之我们今晚要出去玩  你也来
- Good. - Anyway, we're going out tonight and you have to come.

464
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:57,440
-好吧  -天呐  你真好说话  疯丫头
- All right. -God, you're not hard to convince! Perv.

465
00:52:57,810 --> 00:52:58,850
什么
Who?

466
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,440
你有什么衣服穿吗
Have you got anything to wear?

467
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:06,170
你可不能穿这个  看起来像个德国疯子
You can't wear those, you look like some mad German.

468
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:17,100
害怕吗
Are you scared?

469
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:18,810
有什么可怕的
Of what?

470
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:11,300
我们现在要接吻吗
Are we going to kiss now?

471
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,300
你愿意吗
Would you like to?

472
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:24,440
接吻会带动34块面部肌肉
Kissing requires a total of 34 facial muscles

473
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:27,780
以及112块肢体肌肉
and 112 postural muscles.

474
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:31,470
而其中起主导作用的是
The most important muscle involved

475
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:33,340
口轮匝肌
is the orbicularis oris muscle,

476
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:36,680
因为要靠它来噘起嘴唇
because it is used to pucker the lips.

477
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:55,910
汉娜  你这个疯子
Hanna, you mentalist!

478
00:56:56,130 --> 00:56:59,280
跟你朋友说  我就是想吻她一下

479
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,870

482

486
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:57,790

继续睡吧

488
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:20,650
天呐  你跟个土匪似的  真丢人

489
00:58:20,850 --> 00:58:22,960
-我怎么了  -我真服你了
- Like what? - Oh, I can't believe you.

490
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:39,720

我知道你对我很失望
I know you're disappointed in me.

492
00:58:43,110 --> 00:58:46,260
我懂  抱歉  妈妈

493
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:51,280
但是  我也许找到了一个好办法

497
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,170

498

我是来找埃里克的

499
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:13,840

500
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:16,620
也就是说你见过他
So you've seen him?

501

你没有过孩子吧

我有其他重要的事做

505
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:44,410
那你永远也无法体会

她怎么来的  跟她父亲一起吗
How did she get here? Is she with her father?

561
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:55,760
不是  她自己来的

562
01:03:56,610 --> 01:03:57,600
什么
What?

563
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,030
人们有自己教育孩子的方式
Look, other people have their own style of parenting.

564
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:02,390
他提倡独立性
He's promoting independence.

565
01:04:02,590 --> 01:04:04,460
她像个孤儿一样  是我太保守了吧
She's like an orphan! Call me conservative.

566
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:06,820
-你真的很保守吗  亲爱的  -我才不是
- Are you really conservative, darling? - No, I'm not.

567
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:08,500
我说我们可以顺路带她去里昂
I said we'll give her a lift to Lyon.

568
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:09,960
我们下一站是去里昂吧
We are going to Lyon, aren't we?

569
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:12,150
我找到了早餐
I found breakfast.

570
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,610
好恶心啊

我们发现他了  我们发现海勒了

Do you read me? Bring him to Wiegler.

573

574

在乡下我觉得很踏实
I feel so grounded in the countryside.

578
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:05,390
城市让我窒息
The city stifles me,

579
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:08,660
压抑着我的情绪  创造力和精神
emotionally, creatively, spiritually.

580
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:13,110
这样的地方让我们更接近上帝
Places like this bring us closer to God.

581
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,330
上帝
God?

582
01:08:15,570 --> 01:08:17,810
不是很现代的感觉
Well, not any modernistic sense.

583
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:21,470
佛祖  克利须那  我们的上帝
Buddha, Krishna, the God within.

584
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:21,470
克利须那是印度教的神祗

585
01:08:22,450 --> 01:08:23,530
无论你信仰什么
Whatever you believe in.

586
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:29,680
你有信仰吗  汉娜
What do you believe in, Hanna?

587

没有
Nothing.

588
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:46,250
你没事吧
Everything alright?

589

我想是的
I think so.

590
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:25,000
我不知道孩子是不是能听到我说话
I'm not sure if it's true that the baby can hear me,

591
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:27,220
但在夜晚我能感受到她
but at night I feel her.

592
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:29,230
我希望她能听到我说话
I hope she hears me.

593
01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:31,910
你也曾有这样的感觉吗  妈妈
Was it like this for you, mama?

594
01:09:32,370 --> 01:09:34,960
我想我知道她的样子
I think I know what she looks like.

595
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:37,610
当我闭上眼睛就能看到她
I can see her when I close my eyes.

596
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:41,820
我能听到她在我身体里  胎动
I can hear her inside me. Movings.

597
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:46,000
我是不是很傻  我想应该是个女孩
Do you think is that silly? Oh, I think it's a girl.

598
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:48,070
希望是

603

我听说你死了
I heard you were dead.

604
01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:04,540
是你女儿告诉你的吗
Did your little girl tell you that?

605
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:08,060
-你在听什么  -自救
- What are you listening to? - Self help.

606

你需要帮助吗

很高兴听你说话
It's good to hear you.

608
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:15,160
路易斯  派技术组

609
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:16,700
没想到我们还有机会说话
I didn't imagine we'd have the chance to talk.

610
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:19,320
你还没抓到她吧  你没那本事
You don't have her, do you? You're not that good.

611
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,720
埃里克  你真会调情

615

埃里克  你还在吗

汉娜  我想我们迷路了

看不清地图

停下来了吧  我想撒尿

太奇怪了  完全没道理

我觉得我和孩子关系不错

不是给你用的  亲爱的

但是我们其他人需要纸和电脑

706
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:37,920
这样我们就不用
so we don't have to ask people their names

707
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:39,500
当面问人们的名字了

708
01:23:44,090 --> 01:23:45,240
你长得很好看

712
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:55,800
你就是这样走路的  亲爱的
Yes, you do! You do, my dear! Uh uh.

713

他还真是把世上的好东西
He has truely limited you from all the wonderful things

720
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:28,540
都跟你分开了

721
01:24:29,190 --> 01:24:30,630
没有魔术

没有音乐
No music.

723

我会教你的

他知道的不多
He doesn't know much

730
01:26:24,660 --> 01:26:26,090
或者他很会撒谎

731
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:28,350
他认识约翰娜
