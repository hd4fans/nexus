00:03:56,535 --> 00:03:58,264
<i>Yes, sir. I will do that.</i>

2
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,785
<i>Urgent. Urgent.</i>

3
00:04:19,825 --> 00:04:22,020
Where's Lin? Lin Braddock?

4
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:23,028
She left.

5
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:24,029
You know where she went?

6
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:25,291
I don't know.

7
00:04:30,936 --> 00:04:32,335
Lin...

8
00:04:32,371 --> 00:04:34,566
is your man really
take you to America?

9
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,802
Yes, of course.

10
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,540
What about all this?

11
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:49,250
I can't take everything.

12
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:23,450
What about this?

13
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,157
Yes. Take it.

14
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:26,852
Take anything you want.

15
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,858
Stay back! Stay back!

16
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:32,329
I can't let you in!

17
00:05:33,065 --> 00:05:34,498
Please disperse.

18
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:36,861
We can't help you all.

19
00:05:36,902 --> 00:05:38,529
We have no room!

20
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:40,766
Captain, has a Lin Braddock
come through the gate?

21
00:05:40,806 --> 00:05:44,503
If you work for the Embassy,
have your papers ready!

22
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:50,138
Not yet, Colonel.

23
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:51,376
You're a friend of Lin?

24
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:52,441
I'm her husband.

25
00:05:52,484 --> 00:05:53,974
She went to her home.

26
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:55,145
When?

27
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:56,586
One hour, maybe two.

28
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,613
She had to get her papers.

29
00:05:58,657 --> 00:06:00,682
Please disperse!

30
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,958
The dress is so beautiful.

31
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:10,434
Thank you.

32
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,166
Good-bye, Min. Take care.

33
00:06:15,207 --> 00:06:16,196
Bye.

34
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:08,511
Hold it.

35
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,715
We found her upstairs.
You know her?

36
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:11,810
Guess what I've got.

37
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:34,199
All right. Hit it.

38
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,222
Roger.

39
00:10:39,371 --> 00:10:41,464
I said
get the hell off of there!

40
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,279
I'm Lin Braddock!

41
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:52,874
Look at the list!

42
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:55,409
I work for the Embassy!

43
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:56,716
Lin Braddock!

44
00:10:56,755 --> 00:10:57,722
Captain!

45
00:10:57,756 --> 00:10:58,723
What is it?

46
00:10:58,757 --> 00:11:00,418
She says she's on the list.

47
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:01,426
What name?

48
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,552
Lin Braddock!

49
00:11:02,594 --> 00:11:05,154
I'm a translator
for the embassy!

50
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:06,164
Give me your papers.

51
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:08,530
I lost them!
They stole it!

52
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,262
Please! Look at the list!

53
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:12,133
I need your papers!

54
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,934
I told you! Somebody stole them!

55
00:11:14,973 --> 00:11:16,167
Oh, God! You have to believe me!

56
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,233
Well, there's nothing
I can do about that.

57
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:21,041
Please! Lin!
Look at the list!

58
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:22,205
This morning there was
a Colonel Braddock.

59
00:11:22,247 --> 00:11:23,578
Is Colonel Braddock
your husband?

60
00:11:23,615 --> 00:11:24,604
Yes! Yes!

61
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:36,685
For crying out loud!
These people are crazy!

62
00:11:36,728 --> 00:11:38,252
Get them down!

63
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,322
Shoot them! Get it together!

64
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:48,973
Grab the seal.

65
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:53,707
Step aside! Move!

66
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:57,372
Come on, Junior.
Get these folks out!

67
00:12:01,753 --> 00:12:03,653
Get off me!
Get out of the way!

68
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,214
Move! Stand aside!

69
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:15,357
Let's go!

70
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,336
Please!

71
00:12:24,476 --> 00:12:26,706
Wait! Please!

72
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,872
Please!

73
00:12:50,435 --> 00:12:51,459
Commander, please.

74
00:12:51,503 --> 00:12:52,492
I give you
a thousand dollar.

75
00:12:52,537 --> 00:12:55,472
Please. I love America.
Come on.

76
00:12:55,507 --> 00:12:56,496
Hey.

77
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:58,301
Let me go up.

78
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:09,843
Let me go!

79
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,883
OK. Take off.

80
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:17,394
Son of a bitch!

81
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:24,501
Don't worry.
We got you, Colonel!

82
00:13:24,536 --> 00:13:25,696
That bastard was probably V.C.

83
00:13:25,737 --> 00:13:27,705
All right.
There you go, Colonel.

84
00:13:29,007 --> 00:13:30,406
All right.
Move them out. Move!

85
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:45,714
No medals, no ribbons

86
00:13:45,757 --> 00:13:48,487
No welcome parade

87
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:51,724
It's a lonely road home

88
00:13:51,763 --> 00:13:56,462
And a heavy price to pay

89
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:03,901
Now I say a prayer

90
00:14:03,942 --> 00:14:06,775
For those that remain

91
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:08,712
And I wonder

92
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:16,483
Will they ever
find freedom again?

93
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:36,899
- Hi, Cindy.
- Hey.

94
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:39,274
I should run for president.

95
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:40,278
What'd you say?

96
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:41,301
I didn't think he needed to.

97
00:14:41,346 --> 00:14:42,472
Oh, really?

98
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:06,630
Mr. Braddock?

99
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:08,673
That's right.

100
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:10,834
Colonel James Braddock?

101
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,212
What can I do for you?

102
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,578
Could I have a few
moments of your time?

103
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:20,316
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

104
00:15:25,223 --> 00:15:26,520
Please, uh...

105
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:29,083
could we please talk
more privately?

106
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,824
Yeah. Sure.

107
00:15:33,865 --> 00:15:35,059
Thank you.

108
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,049
Would you like
something to drink?

109
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,345
No, no. Thank you.

110
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,046
I am Reverend Polanski...

111
00:15:55,086 --> 00:15:58,249
from the Amerasian Children's
Mission in Vietnam.

112
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,587
Occasionally,
I come to this country...

113
00:15:59,624 --> 00:16:01,455
to raise funds for the mission.

114
00:16:01,993 --> 00:16:04,154
I was hoping I could
find you before I went back.

115
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:06,494
Find me? Why?

116
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:10,433
About a year ago,
a young Amerasian child...

117
00:16:10,468 --> 00:16:13,665
came to the mission
begging for help.

118
00:16:13,705 --> 00:16:16,139
He told me that
his mother was sick.

119
00:16:16,174 --> 00:16:18,005
I went to see if there
was anything I could do...

120
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:20,705
and found out she worked
for the U.S. Embassy...

121
00:16:20,745 --> 00:16:22,110
during the war.

122
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:26,709
She has been severely punished
by the Vietnamese government.

123
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:28,719
Having the half-American
son has made things...

124
00:16:28,753 --> 00:16:29,720
even worse for her.

125
00:16:29,754 --> 00:16:31,915
I'm sorry to hear that, but...

126
00:16:32,657 --> 00:16:34,022
what's that
got to do with me?

127
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:39,292
The woman's married name
is Mrs. James Braddock.

128
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,923
What did you say?

129
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:43,264
I'm talking about
your wife, Mr. Braddock.

130
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:44,268
Lin Tan Cang.

131
00:16:44,302 --> 00:16:45,997
You're mistaken.

132
00:16:46,037 --> 00:16:47,834
No. There is no mistake.

133
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:50,068
My wife died during
the fall of Saigon.

134
00:16:50,108 --> 00:16:52,906
Your wife is alive.
I know her quite well.

135
00:16:52,944 --> 00:16:54,411
Your son's name is Van.

136
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:55,913
He's now 12 years old.

137
00:16:55,947 --> 00:16:57,972
My wife and I didn't have a son.

138
00:16:58,016 --> 00:17:01,110
Why is it so hard
for you to believe me?

139
00:17:01,152 --> 00:17:04,087
Because I saw my wife's body
burned to a crisp, that's why.

140
00:17:04,122 --> 00:17:05,714
You may have seen a body...

141
00:17:05,757 --> 00:17:06,985
but it wasn't your wife.

142
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:08,788
Lin Tan Cang is alive!

143
00:17:11,396 --> 00:17:12,988
Believe whatever
you want, Reverend.

144
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:15,261
I know better.

145
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,325
Your few moments are up.

146
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:28,045
Oh, they had this great
place in Georgetown.

147
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,774
Really nice.

148
00:17:30,615 --> 00:17:32,845
Yeah, of course.
I saw it last week.

149
00:17:32,884 --> 00:17:34,317
Even if you did believe me...

150
00:17:34,352 --> 00:17:37,378
I doubt if there
is anything you could do.

151
00:17:37,422 --> 00:17:39,014
I've already gone
to the State Department...

152
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:40,649
and they will do nothing...

153
00:17:41,459 --> 00:17:43,290
but I had to let you know.

154
00:17:44,729 --> 00:17:46,924
Good-bye, Mr. Braddock.

155
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,626
God be with you.

156
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:14,217
Braddock?

157
00:18:15,293 --> 00:18:16,453
C.I.A.

158
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:19,325
Please come with us.

159
00:18:59,804 --> 00:19:02,034
Wait outside.

160
00:19:05,243 --> 00:19:08,235
It's been a long time,
Colonel Braddock.

161
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:09,940
How have you been?

162
00:19:09,981 --> 00:19:12,108
You know how I've
been, Littlejohn.

163
00:19:13,918 --> 00:19:15,977
Now, what do you want?

164
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:19,184
You just met with
a Reverend Polanski.

165
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:20,191
So?

166
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:22,352
Did he tell you
some kind of...

167
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:26,262
crazy story about
your wife being alive?

168
00:19:31,002 --> 00:19:32,196
Is it a crazy story?

169
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:34,102
Of course it is.

170
00:19:41,913 --> 00:19:44,143
Big mistake, Littlejohn.

171
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:48,752
I didn't believe it until now.

172
00:19:52,123 --> 00:19:54,182
What are you going to do
about getting them out?

173
00:19:56,961 --> 00:19:58,223
Nothing.

174
00:19:58,263 --> 00:19:59,992
If I don't get them out...

175
00:20:00,965 --> 00:20:02,330
they're going to die.

176
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:06,936
People die every day.

177
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:12,306
Braddock!

178
00:20:12,343 --> 00:20:14,402
I'm warning you.

179
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:16,880
Don't step on any toes.

180
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,784
I don't step on toes,
Littlejohn.

181
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,753
I step on necks.

182
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,642
Welcome to Bangkok.

183
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:55,050
We hope you enjoyed
your flight...

184
00:20:55,086 --> 00:20:57,384
and will fly
with Thai Airlines again.

185
00:21:09,734 --> 00:21:11,099
Take me downtown.

186
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,669
40 bob, please.

187
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:43,025
Now, look here, mate.

188
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:44,625
I said I need more room.

189
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:45,727
Now beat it!

190
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,477
Whoo! You take me home.

191
00:21:58,816 --> 00:22:00,374
You want to try knocking me off?

192
00:22:01,686 --> 00:22:03,517
How the hell are you, Braddock?

193
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:05,455
Did you get everything?

194
00:22:07,825 --> 00:22:09,292
Yes, I got everything...

195
00:22:09,327 --> 00:22:11,557
but it sure as hell wasn't easy.

196
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:13,860
That's why
I appreciate you, Mik.

197
00:22:13,898 --> 00:22:16,366
That's what friends
are for, Braddock...

198
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:17,892
which reminds me.

199
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:19,096
Got my money?

200
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:28,913
Let's go.

201
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:30,778
No, no, no!
No need to hurry.

202
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:32,943
The plane won't be loaded
for several hours yet.

203
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:34,952
We got a long drive out of town.

204
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:40,322
Oh, shit. Here comes trouble.

205
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:44,986
Go get the car
and pull out front.

206
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:46,553
Ah, OK.

207
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:49,333
Hey.

208
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:50,857
You're not going
anywhere, Miklachek.

209
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:51,926
Take him to the car.

210
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,995
Jeez. Hey, where's
the rules about...

211
00:22:54,038 --> 00:22:55,596
Hey, watch my beer,
man! Hey, listen.

212
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,406
I warned you, Braddock,
not to fuck with us.

213
00:23:01,045 --> 00:23:02,945
Don't try to stop me,
Littlejohn.

214
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,471
You're stopped.

215
00:23:04,515 --> 00:23:06,039
Come on.

216
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,714
Oh! Oh, my God!

217
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:17,154
Freeze, asshole,
or you're dead!

218
00:23:31,075 --> 00:23:32,542
Excuse me, girls.

219
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:34,869
Braddock!

220
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:44,379
Cut him off!

221
00:23:44,922 --> 00:23:46,082
Braddock!

222
00:23:54,098 --> 00:23:55,087
Braddock.

223
00:23:58,403 --> 00:24:00,428
Stop right there.

224
00:24:08,746 --> 00:24:10,475
Braddock! Wait!

225
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:22,057
Son of a bitch.

226
00:24:41,412 --> 00:24:42,606
You actually made it.

227
00:24:45,216 --> 00:24:46,205
- Shit!
- Uh-oh.

228
00:24:51,255 --> 00:24:54,622
Braddock!
He's getting away!

229
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,457
Hurry! Get in your cars!
Go after him! Hit it!

230
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:59,690
Oh, no!

231
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:10,632
Way to go, man!

232
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:36,963
Jesus, Braddock.

233
00:25:37,568 --> 00:25:39,832
Couldn't you lighten up
just a teeny bit?

234
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,930
I mean, I got to live here.

235
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:44,237
You've got a one-way
ticket out.

236
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:08,127
Jesus, Braddock.

237
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,889
Watch it!

238
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,176
Whoa!

239
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,262
Oh, shit, Braddock.

240
00:26:49,907 --> 00:26:53,707
We'll have the whole
damn police force after us.

241
00:26:53,744 --> 00:26:55,439
How far is it
to the plane?

242
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,505
Uh, it's quite a ways
out of Bangkok.

243
00:26:57,548 --> 00:27:00,415
No. It will be daylight
before we get there.

244
00:27:04,021 --> 00:27:05,352
Hey, the boss is coming!

245
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,727
Don't hang around!

246
00:27:10,761 --> 00:27:13,787
Why didn't you have
her going, man?

247
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,960
Let's go!

248
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,699
Come, come, come!

249
00:27:27,311 --> 00:27:29,040
Are you sure this thing
will get off the ground?

250
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,548
Oh, relax, mother.

251
00:27:31,582 --> 00:27:34,050
Sit back. Enjoy the ride.

252
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:35,882
It'll be just like Coney Island.

253
00:28:08,352 --> 00:28:10,980
OK, Braddock...

254
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,785
are you gonna tell me
where we're going now?

255
00:28:12,823 --> 00:28:14,723
As if I didn't know.

256
00:28:15,426 --> 00:28:18,452
Along the coast.
Ganh Rai Bay.

257
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:23,994
We're gonna have to
skim the waves...

258
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:27,061
when we get there to
stay underneath their radar.

259
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:36,745
Hey, Braddock, you've
done some flying.

260
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:38,715
Why don't you take
the controls, eh?

261
00:28:38,749 --> 00:28:39,977
Give me a rest.

262
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:43,518
Let's see if you can fly
as well as you can drive, eh?

263
00:28:43,554 --> 00:28:44,714
It's been a long time.

264
00:28:44,755 --> 00:28:45,949
Oh, you can do it.

265
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,389
I tell you...

266
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:48,653
it's a lot calmer up here...

267
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:50,661
than it is in your automobile.

268
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:00,530
You know, when we get
to the drop zone...

269
00:29:00,571 --> 00:29:01,902
I'm gonna pull her
up into a climb...

270
00:29:01,939 --> 00:29:03,270
and you'll have
about five seconds...

271
00:29:03,307 --> 00:29:05,775
to make the drop before
I put her into a dive.

272
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,243
I'll need ten seconds.

273
00:29:08,112 --> 00:29:10,307
Well, if you're a good boy,
I'll give you ten seconds.

274
00:29:14,885 --> 00:29:17,285
Vietnam.

275
00:29:17,321 --> 00:29:19,721
I never thought
I'd be coming back.

276
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:22,248
I guess we never really
can leave, can we?

277
00:29:24,261 --> 00:29:25,250
Aw, come on.

278
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:26,354
Get your ass back there.

279
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:27,386
I'll take it.

280
00:29:47,084 --> 00:29:48,073
OK, Braddock.

281
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,746
You got thirty seconds.

282
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:04,362
Good luck, mother.

283
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:25,856
See you in hell,
you crazy bastard.

284
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,680
Come on!

285
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:49,852
Let us each give thanks
in our own way.

286
00:33:58,602 --> 00:34:00,536
- Amen.
- Amen.

287
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:07,842
Thank you, Father,
wise and good...

288
00:34:07,878 --> 00:34:11,405
for home and friends
and daily food.

289
00:34:11,448 --> 00:34:14,611
Bless, dear Lord,
the food we take...

290
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,142
and keep us all...

291
00:34:17,521 --> 00:34:19,284
Oh, my God.

292
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:25,824
And keep us all home and safe.

293
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:27,524
Amen.

294
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:34,459
Please start without me.

295
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:35,494
I'll be right back.

296
00:34:41,812 --> 00:34:43,370
Braddock.

297
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,143
How on earth did you get here?

298
00:34:45,182 --> 00:34:46,149
Where's my wife?

299
00:34:46,183 --> 00:34:47,673
She doesn't live very far.

300
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:49,151
Can you tell me
how to get there?

301
00:34:49,186 --> 00:34:51,677
I'll take you there.

302
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:55,658
Here. Wear this.
There's a curfew.

303
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:57,684
We must be very careful.

304
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:12,665
I tried to tell you
how bad it was.

305
00:35:13,877 --> 00:35:15,606
You'd better go, Reverend.

306
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:16,908
And thanks.

307
00:35:16,947 --> 00:35:19,643
Good luck. God bless you.

308
00:36:56,246 --> 00:36:57,838
I didn't know.

309
00:36:57,881 --> 00:36:59,178
I thought you were...

310
00:36:59,783 --> 00:37:02,047
It's not important.

311
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:06,517
I prayed you would
come for us...

312
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,422
and you are here.

313
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:11,451
That is all that matters
to Van and I.

314
00:37:16,967 --> 00:37:19,458
This is your son, Jim.

315
00:37:20,804 --> 00:37:22,066
Hello, Van.

316
00:37:26,376 --> 00:37:28,401
I speak English, Braddock.

317
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:34,842
For years, he dreamed about you.

318
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:38,321
Sometimes, in very
difficult moments...

319
00:37:38,355 --> 00:37:40,323
I would find him
talking to you...

320
00:37:40,357 --> 00:37:41,824
as if you were there...

321
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:45,454
and somehow you would
make things right for him...

322
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:49,330
but one day,
he stopped believing.

323
00:37:49,366 --> 00:37:52,665
I tried to keep you
alive in his heart.

324
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:55,165
I tried.

325
00:38:04,414 --> 00:38:07,315
I guess I know
how you feel, Van...

326
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,352
thinking that I deserted
you and your mother...

327
00:38:10,387 --> 00:38:13,720
but... I want you
to know that...

328
00:38:13,757 --> 00:38:15,691
Van, please.

329
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:20,627
If I had known that you
and your mother were alive...

330
00:38:22,132 --> 00:38:23,190
there's nothing in the world...

331
00:38:23,233 --> 00:38:26,134
that would have stopped me
from coming for you before now.

332
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:50,986
You've suffered so much.

333
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:57,632
I know I have changed, Jim.

334
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:03,602
I'm sorry I'm no longer
pretty for you.

335
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:11,979
You'll always be
beautiful to me.

336
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,284
We have to go now.

337
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:27,628
We are ready.

338
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,648
Let me check the street first.

339
00:40:42,272 --> 00:40:43,899
Van, hurry.

340
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:39,284
Come on.

341
00:41:42,232 --> 00:41:43,699
Hurry, hurry.

342
00:42:02,652 --> 00:42:04,779
The boat's right down there.

343
00:42:17,467 --> 00:42:18,661
It might be a tight squeeze...

344
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:21,102
but I think you're going
to enjoy the ride, Van.

345
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:22,662
If you say so, Braddock.

346
00:42:26,376 --> 00:42:28,003
Please be patient.

347
00:42:28,044 --> 00:42:30,945
We've only had each other
for twelve years...

348
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:32,846
and now...

349
00:42:35,318 --> 00:42:38,287
it is very difficult for him.

350
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:40,889
He will need some time.

351
00:42:41,925 --> 00:42:43,722
We have all the time
in the world.

352
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:49,457
I love you very much,
Jim Braddock.

353
00:43:09,953 --> 00:43:13,480
I think I should talk
to our son for a moment.

354
00:43:13,523 --> 00:43:15,718
I'll go get the boat ready.

355
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:23,260
Van.

356
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:32,034
Everything will be all right.

357
00:43:32,075 --> 00:43:34,009
You don't care about me now.

358
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:36,039
You only care about HIM.

359
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:38,479
That is not true.

360
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:41,484
It was our love that
brought you into this world.

361
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:44,078
Your father loves you as I do.

362
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,850
If you will only
give him a chance.

363
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,858
Please try, Van.

364
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:06,702
I'm very scared.

365
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:10,837
I know you are...

366
00:44:12,582 --> 00:44:14,311
but once we get to America...

367
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:16,846
everything will be better.

368
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:18,320
I promise.

369
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:24,385
Your father promises.

370
00:44:24,427 --> 00:44:25,394
Lin, we have to
get out of here.

371
00:44:25,428 --> 00:44:26,417
Hurry!

372
00:44:52,522 --> 00:44:53,955
Foolish.

373
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:55,457
You're in Nam.

374
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,593
Very foolish to come back.

375
00:44:58,628 --> 00:45:02,029
I am General Quoc.

376
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,992
How do you do, Madam Braddock?

377
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,527
And yoi.

378
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:13,434
And this must be your son Van.

379
00:45:13,476 --> 00:45:15,501
Very good-looking boy.

380
00:45:18,014 --> 00:45:20,539
When I received the report...

381
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:24,020
that a strange-looking boat
had outrun my gunboats...

382
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:26,579
and heading towards
Ho Chi Minh city...

383
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:28,523
I took the privilege...

384
00:45:28,558 --> 00:45:32,255
of assuming it was you,
Colonel Braddock...

385
00:45:32,295 --> 00:45:34,957
since Reverend Polanski
had just returned...

386
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:36,329
from your country...

387
00:45:36,833 --> 00:45:38,494
but now...

388
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:41,294
Braddock...

389
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:47,842
you must pay for the crimes
that you have committed...

390
00:45:47,877 --> 00:45:50,277
against my beloved country.

391
00:45:50,313 --> 00:45:52,338
They have nothing
to do with this.

392
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:56,682
You are absolutely right.

393
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:05,791
No!

394
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:09,856
Ma!

395
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:15,497
You will find your first test...

396
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,963
quite challenging.

397
00:48:38,848 --> 00:48:42,249
Usually, we use people
who are...

398
00:48:42,285 --> 00:48:44,048
a little bit taller.

399
00:49:14,617 --> 00:49:17,313
I have tested
many before, Braddock...

400
00:49:17,353 --> 00:49:21,255
and no one has lasted
even an hour.

401
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:24,488
Maybe you can be the first, eh?

402
00:49:24,527 --> 00:49:26,392
I'll do whatever you want.

403
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,256
Just let the boy go.

404
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:37,130
You will do what I want anyways.

405
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:21,699
Well done.

406
00:51:21,744 --> 00:51:24,269
Well done, Colonel Braddock.

407
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:28,080
You are every bit as tough
as your reputation.

408
00:51:28,851 --> 00:51:30,512
I like that.

409
00:51:46,669 --> 00:51:49,331
You have not disappointed
me, Braddock.

410
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:42,580
No!

411
00:52:49,561 --> 00:52:52,860
This has gone on long enough.

412
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,603
No!

413
00:55:59,451 --> 00:56:00,418
Van!

414
00:56:00,452 --> 00:56:02,147
I'm in here!

415
00:56:04,389 --> 00:56:05,378
Come on! Come on!

416
00:56:44,763 --> 00:56:45,821
Can you make it?

417
00:56:45,864 --> 00:56:46,762
Yeah.

418
00:56:46,798 --> 00:56:48,060
Go to the mission.

419
00:59:27,625 --> 00:59:29,092
What's wrong?

420
00:59:29,127 --> 00:59:30,116
What are you doing?

421
00:59:30,161 --> 00:59:32,493
Where is Braddock?

422
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:36,733
I don't know where
Braddock is, General.

423
00:59:36,768 --> 00:59:39,794
You lie, priest. You lie!

424
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:41,738
We know you helped Braddock!

425
00:59:41,773 --> 00:59:44,207
I? You must be mistaken.

426
00:59:48,613 --> 00:59:49,580
You lie!

427
00:59:49,614 --> 00:59:52,981
Perhaps a change
of environment...

428
00:59:53,017 --> 00:59:55,508
will help you
to think more clearly!

429
01:00:26,584 --> 01:00:27,642
Take him!

430
01:00:30,688 --> 01:00:31,677
Please, no.

431
01:00:31,723 --> 01:00:32,712
I can't leave my children.

432
01:00:32,757 --> 01:00:33,815
They need me!

433
01:00:33,858 --> 01:00:36,019
Of course!

434
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:37,687
I would not want
to separate you...

435
01:00:37,729 --> 01:00:41,665
from your half-breed
American bastard children!

436
01:00:42,534 --> 01:00:44,331
Take them all!

437
01:01:58,142 --> 01:02:01,873
Priest, your new home
will be Olaha prison!

438
01:07:18,129 --> 01:07:20,620
Don't! Don't!

439
01:07:20,665 --> 01:07:21,654
Don't!

440
01:07:22,767 --> 01:07:26,635
No! No!

441
01:07:52,163 --> 01:07:53,755
Stop!

442
01:07:57,868 --> 01:07:59,426
Stop!

443
01:09:09,707 --> 01:09:11,299
Kids! In the truck!

444
01:09:18,215 --> 01:09:19,273
Van!

445
01:09:19,316 --> 01:09:20,283
Where's the Reverend?

446
01:09:20,317 --> 01:09:22,478
I know! I get him, Braddock!

447
01:10:59,683 --> 01:11:00,945
Come on, Reverend.

448
01:11:01,519 --> 01:11:03,282
Thank God, Braddock!

449
01:14:38,869 --> 01:14:40,268
Protect yourself!

450
01:16:00,584 --> 01:16:02,814
Reverend, get the kids
out of here!

451
01:16:11,261 --> 01:16:13,786
Out! Hurry! Hurry!

452
01:16:13,831 --> 01:16:15,958
We must get away
from the truck!

453
01:16:27,978 --> 01:16:30,208
Hurry up, Braddock! Here!

454
01:16:55,539 --> 01:16:56,801
Get down, Reverend!

455
01:17:33,610 --> 01:17:34,599
It's OK.

456
01:17:44,154 --> 01:17:46,122
Ninety kilometers to the border.

457
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:48,314
You don't expect
these children...

458
01:17:48,358 --> 01:17:50,019
to walk ninety kilometers!

459
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:52,221
I don't expect
a damn thing, Reverend.

460
01:17:53,096 --> 01:17:56,395
But walk or crawl,
we're gonna make it.

461
01:17:56,433 --> 01:17:57,798
Come on, kids.

462
01:18:05,108 --> 01:18:06,666
Come on, Reverend.

463
01:18:35,572 --> 01:18:36,664
Braddock...

464
01:18:37,574 --> 01:18:38,598
Braddock...

465
01:18:42,579 --> 01:18:44,444
the children are dead tired.

466
01:18:44,481 --> 01:18:46,039
We must stop to rest.

467
01:18:46,083 --> 01:18:48,551
Please, Braddock.

468
01:18:48,585 --> 01:18:50,450
They are not very strong.

469
01:19:01,698 --> 01:19:03,359
Wait here.

470
01:19:51,014 --> 01:19:52,811
Reverend. Reverend!

471
01:19:52,849 --> 01:19:54,111
Bring the kids.

472
01:19:54,151 --> 01:19:55,243
Hurry.

473
01:19:55,285 --> 01:19:56,684
Come. Come, children.

474
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:58,984
Quiet. Be quiet.

475
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:26,633
Come, children. Hurry. Hurry.

476
01:22:30,507 --> 01:22:32,372
Come, children.

477
01:22:32,409 --> 01:22:34,877
Be careful. Be careful.
Don't hurt yourselves.

478
01:22:36,713 --> 01:22:37,873
Come.

479
01:22:39,216 --> 01:22:40,308
Go. Go.

480
01:22:54,331 --> 01:22:56,356
Come on, kids. Hurry!

481
01:23:03,673 --> 01:23:06,665
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry up!

482
01:23:15,585 --> 01:23:17,075
Thomas!

483
01:23:25,462 --> 01:23:26,451
Hurry!

484
01:23:41,711 --> 01:23:43,872
Sit down and hold on.

485
01:23:49,219 --> 01:23:50,208
Damn it.

486
01:24:23,486 --> 01:24:26,353
Braddock, get back, you bastard!

487
01:24:27,691 --> 01:24:29,852
Come on!

488
01:24:33,196 --> 01:24:35,357
Hold on!

489
01:24:45,475 --> 01:24:47,568
Braddock! I will kill you...

490
01:24:47,610 --> 01:24:50,443
and I will burn
those filthy children!

491
01:25:06,496 --> 01:25:07,986
Hold on.

492
01:25:13,570 --> 01:25:15,868
Oh, my God.

493
01:25:16,873 --> 01:25:18,500
Get back there
with the kids, Reverend.

494
01:25:21,144 --> 01:25:23,009
It's gonna get rough.

495
01:25:27,050 --> 01:25:29,518
It's going to get rough.

496
01:25:54,844 --> 01:25:56,937
Mayday. Mayday.

497
01:25:58,448 --> 01:25:59,972
This is
Colonel James Braddock...

498
01:26:00,016 --> 01:26:03,281
calling American Military
Assistance Command.

499
01:26:03,319 --> 01:26:04,684
Come in.

500
01:26:04,721 --> 01:26:06,245
Mayday. Mayday.

501
01:26:08,024 --> 01:26:10,288
Here. Take a seat.

502
01:26:11,294 --> 01:26:12,955
Mayday. Mayday.

503
01:26:12,996 --> 01:26:14,657
This is Colonel Braddock.

504
01:26:14,697 --> 01:26:17,291
I'm in a crippled C-47.

505
01:26:17,333 --> 01:26:19,927
I have a planeload
of Amerasian children.

506
01:26:19,969 --> 01:26:21,197
Losing fuel.

507
01:26:21,237 --> 01:26:24,900
I'm approximately eighty miles
east of the Thai border.

508
01:26:24,941 --> 01:26:28,035
If anyone can hear me,
please transfer this message...

509
01:26:28,078 --> 01:26:30,808
to the American Military
Assistance Command.

510
01:26:31,548 --> 01:26:33,607
Is everyone OK back there?

511
01:26:35,218 --> 01:26:36,742
Are you OK?

512
01:26:36,786 --> 01:26:38,686
Yeah. I fine.

513
01:26:38,721 --> 01:26:39,813
How you?

514
01:26:39,856 --> 01:26:41,187
I'm fine, too.

515
01:27:07,417 --> 01:27:09,544
Reverend! We're going down!

516
01:27:09,586 --> 01:27:11,747
Children! Get down!

517
01:27:11,788 --> 01:27:14,279
Hold on! Hold on!

518
01:27:24,134 --> 01:27:25,465
We're gonna die!

519
01:27:25,502 --> 01:27:27,299
Just hold on!

520
01:28:01,037 --> 01:28:02,368
Van.

521
01:28:22,725 --> 01:28:23,953
Come on, Van.

522
01:28:25,695 --> 01:28:27,390
Help the kids.

523
01:29:22,218 --> 01:29:23,879
Everybody down.

524
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:25,251
Reverend.

525
01:29:29,392 --> 01:29:31,155
My God.

526
01:29:31,194 --> 01:29:34,061
Braddock, there's the border.

527
01:29:34,564 --> 01:29:36,293
As soon as I take
the guards out...

528
01:29:36,332 --> 01:29:38,300
you get the kids
over the bridge...

529
01:29:38,334 --> 01:29:39,494
as fast as you can.

530
01:29:41,771 --> 01:29:43,238
Did you hear what I said?

531
01:30:13,936 --> 01:30:16,234
On my way over here...

532
01:30:16,272 --> 01:30:18,331
I was wondering
what you would be like.

533
01:30:18,374 --> 01:30:20,137
I want you to know...

534
01:30:20,176 --> 01:30:22,440
you're everything
I wanted in a son...

535
01:30:23,913 --> 01:30:25,778
and I'm very proud of you.

536
01:30:35,024 --> 01:30:36,491
I love you.

537
01:31:22,105 --> 01:31:24,335
All right, men. Let's go.

538
01:31:25,608 --> 01:31:27,838
What the hell is happening, Dan?

539
01:31:27,877 --> 01:31:28,969
Braddock and the children.

540
01:31:29,011 --> 01:31:30,842
We intercepted a radio message.

541
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:33,178
They crashed
somewhere near here.

542
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:37,174
Oh, shit.

543
01:33:04,173 --> 01:33:05,800
Van!

544
01:33:20,223 --> 01:33:21,212
Don't go!

545
01:33:22,258 --> 01:33:23,589
Can't leave him, Dan.

546
01:33:23,626 --> 01:33:24,593
I got to help him.

547
01:33:24,627 --> 01:33:26,527
Leave it alone, General.
He's on his own.

548
01:33:26,562 --> 01:33:28,530
No one crosses the border.

549
01:33:42,211 --> 01:33:44,406
Get a medic in, man.

550
01:33:55,191 --> 01:33:56,180
All right!

551
01:34:19,882 --> 01:34:20,849
Daddy!

552
01:34:20,883 --> 01:34:22,441
Don't go!

553
01:34:26,355 --> 01:34:27,754
Christ.

554
01:34:52,715 --> 01:34:54,615
I got you, Braddock!

555
01:34:54,650 --> 01:34:55,947
I got you!

556
01:34:55,985 --> 01:34:57,179
Daddy!

557
01:34:57,219 --> 01:34:59,687
No, no. No, Van.
Get back! Get back!

558
01:34:59,722 --> 01:35:00,746
No. No. Please!

559
01:35:04,493 --> 01:35:05,926
You're finished, Braddock!

560
01:35:05,962 --> 01:35:07,589
I've won!

561
01:35:21,911 --> 01:35:25,278
They will not dare to cross.

562
01:35:39,362 --> 01:35:40,954
What's he doing?

563
01:35:46,969 --> 01:35:49,199
Hold your position.

564
01:35:51,374 --> 01:35:55,310
He makes one wrong move,
we'll climb up his ass.

565
01:35:55,344 --> 01:35:57,642
You got it.

566
01:35:57,680 --> 01:36:00,444
The Americans are bluffing.

567
01:36:00,483 --> 01:36:03,452
They will not dare do any more.

568
01:36:22,905 --> 01:36:25,465
Fire! Fire!

569
01:36:34,350 --> 01:36:35,476
Dad!

570
01:37:13,389 --> 01:37:14,617
There he is!

571
01:37:36,212 --> 01:37:38,077
Oh, Braddock.

572
01:37:40,015 --> 01:37:42,575
Thank God you are alive.

573
01:37:49,458 --> 01:37:51,517
Come on, children.

574
01:38:08,110 --> 01:38:09,304
Thank you.

575
01:38:12,348 --> 01:38:14,248
Bless you.

576
