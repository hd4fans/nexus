1
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,380
Pretty windy out.

2
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:12,100
- That better not be the violent one.
- It's not, Mom.

3
00:02:16,101 --> 00:02:18,061
Dad, look what I can do.

4
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:20,272
I've been practicing.

5
00:02:25,113 --> 00:02:27,913
- Spectacular, kiddo.
- Cool.

6
00:02:30,623 --> 00:02:32,743
You're inside out.

7
00:02:34,124 --> 00:02:38,174
I knew that.
Doesn't work for you?

8
00:02:39,214 --> 00:02:41,594
I can't believe you taught him that.

9
00:02:41,804 --> 00:02:45,054
I didn't. He did it on his own.

10
00:02:46,056 --> 00:02:48,936
- Charlie, did you brush your teeth?
- Yes.

11
00:02:49,186 --> 00:02:51,266
- Charlie.
- I brushed them.

12
00:02:52,016 --> 00:02:55,436
- Look at this, Con.
- Let's go. I'm serious.

13
00:02:55,646 --> 00:02:58,696
You're driving me bonkers, Mom.

14
00:03:00,487 --> 00:03:03,657
Remember when you said no
to buying Omnidell?

15
00:03:03,907 --> 00:03:07,407
- Remember what the price was?
- One fifty.

16
00:03:08,328 --> 00:03:10,128
Close. Sixty-one.

17
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:12,748
- I'll do it, Mom.
- No, I'll do it.

18
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:14,959
You know what it's going for now?

19
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:16,799
- Say "E. "
- E.

20
00:03:17,339 --> 00:03:22,099
- Guess, Con.
- Edward, I don't know, all right?

21
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:24,389
- Now rinse.
- Seventy-four.

22
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,390
Really rinse. And pee.

23
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,940
Seventy-four. Should have bought it.
Shit.

24
00:03:30,481 --> 00:03:34,151
- So buy some.
- Too late, Con. Too late.

25
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:36,941
Lift the seat, honey.

26
00:03:40,742 --> 00:03:43,202
Don't forget to put it down.

27
00:03:44,702 --> 00:03:46,912
When you finish.

28
00:03:49,623 --> 00:03:55,593
- Do you really need all that stuff?
- Mom, no one wears these dorky hats.

29
00:03:55,924 --> 00:03:59,304
- You do and you're not a dork.
- How do I look?

30
00:03:59,554 --> 00:04:01,934
Very handsome.

31
00:04:02,895 --> 00:04:05,855
Love you.
Okay, come on, let's go.

32
00:04:09,025 --> 00:04:10,195
Come on.

33
00:04:11,945 --> 00:04:13,155
You shouldn't go in.

34
00:04:13,405 --> 00:04:17,155
I have stuff to do for the auction.
And there's a birthday soon.

35
00:04:17,407 --> 00:04:21,157
Latrell Sprewell jersey, Mom.
Don't forget.

36
00:04:21,457 --> 00:04:26,917
- He's on the Yankees, right?
- Mom, you're driving me bonkers.

37
00:04:27,168 --> 00:04:30,168
You're driving him bonkers.

38
00:04:34,178 --> 00:04:35,888
Jesus.

39
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,790
Taxi! Shit.

40
00:06:13,411 --> 00:06:15,621
Taxi!

41
00:06:57,465 --> 00:06:58,465
I'm so sorry.

42
00:07:00,176 --> 00:07:02,596
I'm so sorry.

43
00:07:04,597 --> 00:07:05,927
I'm sorry.

44
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:08,807
I'll get your things.

45
00:07:18,818 --> 00:07:21,198
Taxi! Taxi!

46
00:07:21,448 --> 00:07:23,078
My books.

47
00:07:36,631 --> 00:07:40,841
- Could you help me get a taxi?
- Okay.

48
00:07:41,301 --> 00:07:44,931
- I'll watch your books.
- Thanks.

49
00:08:06,374 --> 00:08:09,454
- Bad day for taxis.
- It's this horrible wind.

50
00:08:10,084 --> 00:08:12,874
Yeah, you shot down there
like a bullet!

51
00:08:13,135 --> 00:08:15,635
If you flapped your arms,
you'd be home now.

52
00:08:15,846 --> 00:08:18,846
I'll remember that next time.

53
00:08:19,926 --> 00:08:22,436
- That's not good.
- I know.

54
00:08:22,726 --> 00:08:27,356
Listen, that's me up there.
The flowerpot.

55
00:08:28,687 --> 00:08:31,527
I'll get you a Band-Aid, okay?

56
00:08:34,488 --> 00:08:37,698
Hold onto something.
Don't blow away.

57
00:08:39,489 --> 00:08:43,999
Or you can come on up
and clean it off, no?

58
00:08:44,369 --> 00:08:46,169
Come on.

59
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:50,049
I'm not an ax murderer. I promise.

60
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:02,561
Shit.

61
00:09:04,392 --> 00:09:06,902
Fucking elevator.

62
00:09:12,782 --> 00:09:14,532
One more.

63
00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:39,815
- Pardon the mess.
- Are you a writer?

64
00:09:41,275 --> 00:09:43,485
I'm a book dealer.

65
00:09:46,357 --> 00:09:49,737
Bathroom's right down there,
on the left.

66
00:09:52,077 --> 00:09:55,957
Go ahead. There's a medicine cabinet.

67
00:09:56,158 --> 00:09:59,878
You can sneak a peek
at my prescriptions.

68
00:11:06,826 --> 00:11:08,786
Hello?

69
00:11:18,668 --> 00:11:22,678
- I made you some tea.
- Thank you.

70
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:28,769
- Do you box?
- I used to, when I was young.

71
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:33,439
This is an amazing place.

72
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,689
- Yeah, but it's not mine.
- No?

73
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:40,280
The owner is a friend, a sculptor.
He's in Paris.

74
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:44,950
That's cool.
We can stay here, me and my books.

75
00:11:49,622 --> 00:11:52,962
Can I use your phone?
I have to call home.

76
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,792
Sure, there's a phone just behind you.

77
00:11:56,042 --> 00:11:57,882
Thank you.

78
00:12:03,433 --> 00:12:05,473
Gloria? Hi, it's me.

79
00:12:06,014 --> 00:12:09,524
Good, good. How's Charlie?

80
00:12:09,774 --> 00:12:12,564
Hi, honey. How was your day at school?

81
00:12:12,814 --> 00:12:15,944
Yeah? What was the best part?

82
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:19,905
Guess what? Can you believe it?
Mommy missed her train.

83
00:12:26,706 --> 00:12:28,126
Ice.

84
00:12:29,087 --> 00:12:31,587
About an hour.

85
00:12:32,797 --> 00:12:34,717
You should start your homework.

86
00:12:35,677 --> 00:12:40,267
I promise to tell you all about it
when I see you. I love you. Bye.

87
00:12:41,888 --> 00:12:46,898
That was my son, Charlie.
He's 8. He'll be 9 next week.

88
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:51,318
I'm Paul Martel. I'll be 28 in July.

89
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:56,199
I'm Constance.
And I'm late. I have to go.

90
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,660
Before you go, take a book.

91
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:05,420
No. I couldn't.

92
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:09,131
Sure you can. A souvenir.

93
00:13:09,381 --> 00:13:12,881
Go down there. You know, like before.

94
00:13:13,131 --> 00:13:14,971
Okay.

95
00:13:22,933 --> 00:13:26,313
Keep going. Stop.

96
00:13:26,853 --> 00:13:28,403
Now right.

97
00:13:28,653 --> 00:13:30,823
No, right.

98
00:13:32,114 --> 00:13:36,154
Okay, now the second shelf
from the top. . .

99
00:13:36,364 --> 00:13:39,164
. . .take the fourth one from the left.

100
00:13:39,415 --> 00:13:41,335
Got it?

101
00:13:41,876 --> 00:13:45,126
- Think so.
- Open to page 23.

102
00:13:53,516 --> 00:13:57,846
Drink wine, this is life eternal

103
00:13:58,057 --> 00:14:01,397
This, all that youth will give to you

104
00:14:01,647 --> 00:14:06,397
It is the season for wine, roses
And drunken friends

105
00:14:06,648 --> 00:14:08,698
Be happy for this moment

106
00:14:08,909 --> 00:14:12,369
This moment is your life

107
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,630
I have to go. Thank you.

108
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,470
- Can you find your way out?
- I hope so.

109
00:14:30,591 --> 00:14:32,511
That's my bedroom.

110
00:14:35,312 --> 00:14:38,852
It was nice meeting you, Constance.

111
00:14:39,522 --> 00:14:43,482
Come back if you need more books
or medical attention.

112
00:15:22,317 --> 00:15:24,487
Hey, Glo.

113
00:15:25,328 --> 00:15:29,538
- That wouldn't be the TV on, would it?
- I was just turning it off.

114
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:32,288
Sure you were.

115
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,420
- The wind knocked me down.
- Yeah?

116
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,300
You all right? You need anything?

117
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:49,980
- Gross. Were you in a fight?
- No, just fell over.

118
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:52,391
- Does it hurt?
- Little bit.

119
00:15:52,641 --> 00:15:55,311
- Cool!
- Where are you going?

120
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:59,191
- To get the camera!
- Try this.

121
00:16:00,903 --> 00:16:05,533
- Why do you need the camera?
- It's for school. We're doing blood.

122
00:16:05,783 --> 00:16:09,083
Okay, now look like it really hurts.

123
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,333
- Ready?
- Yeah.

124
00:16:13,874 --> 00:16:15,254
This will be great.

125
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:19,764
The wind blew her down.
She bled and everything.

126
00:16:20,014 --> 00:16:23,974
- Everybody's hats blew off.
- Quite the war photographer. You okay?

127
00:16:24,225 --> 00:16:27,015
Yeah. It took me down
like an old lady.

128
00:16:27,226 --> 00:16:32,186
- It was humiliating.
- Dad, look at the pictures.

129
00:16:32,396 --> 00:16:35,236
At least we got the evidence.
Anyone we can sue?

130
00:16:35,446 --> 00:16:39,366
No. There was this nice guy
who helped me.

131
00:16:39,577 --> 00:16:42,787
It was like this, Dad.
It was a twister.

132
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:48,207
Dad, look. It was like this.

133
00:16:48,418 --> 00:16:50,588
- Wow.
- It's a tornado.

134
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:56,259
He lived around there. He got me
some Band-Aids and put me in a taxi.

135
00:16:56,509 --> 00:16:58,599
Was he good-looking?

136
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:02,969
I feel sick.

137
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:08,230
- You do your homework?
- I can't. I don't know how to do it.

138
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,610
Come on, I'll help you.
Then you can help me with mine.

139
00:17:12,861 --> 00:17:15,821
Did you get his name, this guy?

140
00:17:16,072 --> 00:17:18,742
We could send him a bottle of wine.

141
00:17:19,282 --> 00:17:21,452
Cheap wine.

142
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:40,224
Con, stand there a second.
Wait a minute.

143
00:17:40,804 --> 00:17:44,394
Stay there a second.
I'm trying to figure out the. . . .

144
00:17:45,185 --> 00:17:49,315
The thing I can't figure out
is the zoom-thing.

145
00:17:49,565 --> 00:17:51,945
There it is.
Okay, hold on, stay there.

146
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:56,365
Got the zoomy-thingy zooming.

147
00:17:58,367 --> 00:18:03,127
Stay there. I'm trying to figure
this out. I wanna see if it focuses.

148
00:18:08,008 --> 00:18:09,928
Cool. Very cool.

149
00:18:10,178 --> 00:18:13,388
So beautiful. If you only knew.

150
00:18:13,638 --> 00:18:17,638
Look at you. God, what a beauty.

151
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,990
Something the matter?

152
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,080
Nothing. Nothing at all.

153
00:18:52,473 --> 00:18:56,853
- This is really good.
- No, it isn't. Go away.

154
00:19:01,484 --> 00:19:06,614
I think I'm really zooming.
I found the zoom. Found it.

155
00:19:06,824 --> 00:19:08,864
Dad.

156
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:11,365
- Shit.
- Mom.

157
00:19:11,746 --> 00:19:14,876
I can't sleep.

158
00:19:18,836 --> 00:19:22,836
I'll be back. I'll be back.
Don't fall asleep.

159
00:19:23,137 --> 00:19:24,297
It works.

160
00:19:30,057 --> 00:19:33,977
Mom, are you nuts?
You forgot my lunch.

161
00:19:34,438 --> 00:19:38,438
I did not. It's by the door.
Come with me.

162
00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:41,699
- What are you chewing?
- Nothing.

163
00:19:41,949 --> 00:19:44,609
Spit that out. What is that?

164
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,040
- That's lovely.
- Mom?

165
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,460
I don't want to be a dumb bunny.

166
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:57,590
Honey, it's a play. There's lots
of other bunnies. It'll be cool.

167
00:19:58,131 --> 00:20:00,671
- You're bonkers, Mom.
- So you tell me.

168
00:20:00,922 --> 00:20:04,012
- Love you.
- Love you too. What's that?

169
00:20:04,262 --> 00:20:06,262
Thank you.

170
00:20:09,932 --> 00:20:10,972
Bye.

171
00:22:16,448 --> 00:22:21,538
Hi, this is Paul Martel. Leave
a message after the beep. Thanks.

172
00:22:22,879 --> 00:22:24,539
Hello? Hello?

173
00:22:25,129 --> 00:22:27,089
- Hello?
- Hello?

174
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:29,759
You're there.

175
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:33,549
This is Connie Sumner,
the one from the windy day.

176
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,310
Oh, that one.

177
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,270
How's the knee? Did you ice it?

178
00:22:39,681 --> 00:22:43,691
Yes, I iced it and I elevated it.
You name it, I did it.

179
00:22:43,942 --> 00:22:49,282
It's much better.
I just wanted to call and thank you.

180
00:22:49,492 --> 00:22:52,202
I wanted your address
because I wanted...

181
00:22:52,452 --> 00:22:54,162
- Where are you?
- What?

182
00:22:54,412 --> 00:22:56,702
I said, where are you?

183
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:02,873
I'm in Grand Central.
It's really hard to hear you.

184
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:05,754
- Come and see me.
- What?

185
00:23:06,004 --> 00:23:09,384
Yeah, take a break.
I'll make you some coffee.

186
00:23:12,845 --> 00:23:14,765
Coffee?

187
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:23,485
- Okay.
- Okay.

188
00:23:23,906 --> 00:23:25,486
See you. Bye.

189
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,326
Fuck.

190
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:41,838
No permanent damage, I see.

191
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:49,428
- We take Medicaid, Blue Cross. . . .
- I'm uninsured.

192
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:53,690
No. I'm afraid we don't
take charity cases.

193
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,650
It was a joke.

194
00:24:08,951 --> 00:24:12,201
Look at this. Jack London.

195
00:24:12,412 --> 00:24:16,252
First edition of White Fang,
in the original dust jacket.

196
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:19,343
And I got it for a buck fifty.

197
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:23,673
- What's it worth?
- About 4000 times more.

198
00:24:27,434 --> 00:24:32,524
- Those are in French.
- I took it in school.

199
00:24:37,446 --> 00:24:39,776
Do I want to take off something?

200
00:24:41,866 --> 00:24:46,076
Your coat. Would you like
to take off your coat?

201
00:24:46,326 --> 00:24:48,746
Yes, my coat.

202
00:24:49,246 --> 00:24:51,166
Thank you.

203
00:24:58,967 --> 00:25:03,427
But I can't stay very long.
I have some errands I have to run.

204
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:07,439
- I'll get the coffee.
- Okay.

205
00:25:28,712 --> 00:25:32,382
- It's in Braille.
- Braille.

206
00:25:32,632 --> 00:25:35,632
No, no, Braille.
He was French.

207
00:25:36,922 --> 00:25:38,722
Close your eyes.

208
00:25:38,972 --> 00:25:42,472
- What?
- Close your eyes.

209
00:25:56,745 --> 00:25:59,995
My mother makes me chicken

210
00:26:02,705 --> 00:26:06,335
Her chicken makes me cough

211
00:26:07,706 --> 00:26:10,426
I wish that when she made it

212
00:26:11,217 --> 00:26:14,297
She took the feathers off

213
00:26:19,428 --> 00:26:22,018
It doesn't say that.

214
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:33,909
- I had better go.
- Yeah?

215
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,370
I'd better go.

216
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:43,380
Take care. Don't fall.

217
00:26:43,581 --> 00:26:48,761
- Thanks for the coffee.
- You didn't drink it.

218
00:27:04,943 --> 00:27:08,073
- Lindsay, hi.
- Connie.

219
00:27:08,323 --> 00:27:10,403
- Let me buzz him.
- Thanks.

220
00:27:13,114 --> 00:27:17,084
Hey, what a surprise. Look at you.

221
00:27:17,284 --> 00:27:18,914
- Hi, Bill.
- Hi, Connie.

222
00:27:19,124 --> 00:27:21,544
- Am I interrupting?
- No, I'm leaving.

223
00:27:21,796 --> 00:27:25,176
- I'll get you the budget later.
- All right, thanks.

224
00:27:25,426 --> 00:27:28,926
- Would you like a coffee?
- No, thank you.

225
00:27:34,807 --> 00:27:36,937
That's nice.

226
00:27:38,937 --> 00:27:42,027
I didn't know
you were coming in today.

227
00:27:42,277 --> 00:27:44,697
You're freezing.
What is that?

228
00:27:44,948 --> 00:27:48,448
I was around the corner
and I brought you a present.

229
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:51,329
Wow. What's the occasion?

230
00:27:51,499 --> 00:27:54,369
Nothing. I don't know.

231
00:27:54,709 --> 00:27:58,129
It's a medium,
but they said it runs large.

232
00:27:58,669 --> 00:28:01,799
- Look at that.
- You don't have to try it on.

233
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:05,300
I'm the boss.
I can do whatever I want.

234
00:28:13,022 --> 00:28:14,812
What do you think?

235
00:28:16,562 --> 00:28:18,902
Hold on just a second.

236
00:28:20,022 --> 00:28:21,782
Yeah?

237
00:28:23,692 --> 00:28:25,992
Okay, but hold the other calls.

238
00:28:26,703 --> 00:28:28,413
- You're busy. I'll go.
- Sit.

239
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:30,743
- I'll go.
- No, sit.

240
00:28:31,124 --> 00:28:35,164
Hello, Henry?
So, what is this suspension problem?

241
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:37,834
No, I never received it.

242
00:28:39,215 --> 00:28:42,255
Well, get it to me.

243
00:28:42,885 --> 00:28:47,435
It's not good enough. I'm sitting here
with 200 trucks I can't use.

244
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:51,605
Well, set up a meeting.
And I want Frank Birnbaum there.

245
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:56,606
Because when I tell someone
to do something, I want it done.

246
00:28:56,857 --> 00:28:58,697
I'm sure you will.

247
00:29:03,698 --> 00:29:06,658
So, what else you up to?

248
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:11,248
- Auction.
- Yeah? Who'd you hit on?

249
00:29:13,588 --> 00:29:16,548
The usual suspects.

250
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,680
Who?

251
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,270
- Bob Gaylord.
- Bob?

252
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:30,150
Get Bob to pledge and they should
send you to the Middle East.

253
00:29:36,111 --> 00:29:38,241
So tell me.

254
00:29:39,781 --> 00:29:41,661
What?

255
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:45,743
What do you think?
It's a keeper.

256
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,910
- Hello.
- Hello.

257
00:30:59,162 --> 00:31:03,542
Here I am again. I brought muffins.

258
00:31:18,564 --> 00:31:21,684
- What is this music?
- Do you like it?

259
00:31:21,935 --> 00:31:23,735
Yes.

260
00:31:25,235 --> 00:31:28,115
Do you want to dance?

261
00:31:28,365 --> 00:31:30,485
- Now?
- Yeah.

262
00:31:32,365 --> 00:31:33,825
Okay.

263
00:31:37,206 --> 00:31:42,546
- I have to warn you, I tend to lead.
- Of course. You are American.

264
00:31:53,268 --> 00:31:57,728
- You've done this before.
- What?

265
00:31:59,899 --> 00:32:02,649
How many girlfriends have you had?

266
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,700
Two.

267
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:13,330
- Really?
- Would I lie to you?

268
00:32:13,791 --> 00:32:16,371
I don't know. Would you?

269
00:32:34,473 --> 00:32:40,273
Your eyes are amazing. You should
never shut them, not even at night.

270
00:32:40,524 --> 00:32:43,944
You should learn to sleep
with your eyes open.

271
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:50,324
- I'll work on that.
- Will you?

272
00:32:53,996 --> 00:32:55,956
Hang on.

273
00:33:00,006 --> 00:33:02,546
I think this is a mistake.

274
00:33:04,887 --> 00:33:09,937
There are no mistakes. There's what
you do, and what you don't do.

275
00:33:10,807 --> 00:33:13,147
I can't do this.

276
00:33:25,989 --> 00:33:28,499
Forgot my coat.

277
00:35:44,526 --> 00:35:45,986
- I can't.
- What?

278
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:47,357
What's wrong?

279
00:35:47,607 --> 00:35:50,327
I don't know how to do this.
It's wrong.

280
00:35:50,527 --> 00:35:52,697
- Hit me.
- What?

281
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:54,117
Hit me.

282
00:36:00,749 --> 00:36:01,839
Hit me.

283
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,990
- Hey, Ed.
- Hey, Bob.

284
00:37:39,241 --> 00:37:41,281
- Haven't seen you in a while.
- No.

285
00:37:41,451 --> 00:37:45,371
- I've been working late this week.
- Really? How's the boy?

286
00:37:45,621 --> 00:37:47,331
- It's his birthday.
- How old?

287
00:37:47,581 --> 00:37:48,581
Nine.

288
00:37:48,911 --> 00:37:51,581
So any major armed robberies?

289
00:37:51,792 --> 00:37:54,252
No. No, not this week.

290
00:37:54,503 --> 00:37:57,173
Speaking of which,
watch out for Connie.

291
00:37:57,423 --> 00:38:00,673
- She'll have you sign over your mortgage.
- What?

292
00:38:00,923 --> 00:38:04,553
- Did she try to hit on you for money?
- No.

293
00:38:04,804 --> 00:38:09,564
I thought she talked to you about
this school auction, or whatever.

294
00:38:09,814 --> 00:38:11,024
Not me.

295
00:38:11,234 --> 00:38:14,354
I've been out of town.
Maybe she talked to Maggie.

296
00:38:15,614 --> 00:38:17,984
Yeah, I guess I got it wrong.

297
00:38:18,236 --> 00:38:20,366
Anyway, we owe you a dinner.

298
00:38:22,156 --> 00:38:23,576
Yeah.

299
00:38:32,917 --> 00:38:34,337
He's out.

300
00:38:37,257 --> 00:38:38,927
Can I get you anything?

301
00:38:39,177 --> 00:38:42,137
No. No, I'm fine, thanks.

302
00:38:45,729 --> 00:38:48,769
- Tough day?
- No, not really.

303
00:38:50,939 --> 00:38:53,859
What about you? How was your day?

304
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:55,819
It was good.

305
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:58,780
You know, the usual stuff.

306
00:39:05,751 --> 00:39:07,881
Sure you don't want anything?

307
00:39:08,252 --> 00:39:09,712
No.

308
00:39:11,132 --> 00:39:13,512
- Con?
- Yeah?

309
00:39:14,802 --> 00:39:15,932
Do you love me?

310
00:39:17,432 --> 00:39:20,012
Of course I love you.

311
00:39:21,063 --> 00:39:23,563
What a silly question.

312
00:39:24,643 --> 00:39:26,023
I guess. . .

313
00:39:26,273 --> 00:39:28,903
. . .I'm just feeling silly.

314
00:39:33,945 --> 00:39:35,955
I'll be up in a minute.

315
00:39:36,535 --> 00:39:38,165
Okay.

316
00:39:38,785 --> 00:39:40,495
Oh, sorry.

317
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:47,060
What are we doing here?

318
00:41:48,561 --> 00:41:50,431
Having lunch.

319
00:41:52,392 --> 00:41:56,062
- I shouldn't be doing this.
- You shouldn't have lunch?

320
00:41:57,192 --> 00:41:59,402
Not with you.

321
00:41:59,572 --> 00:42:01,822
I think we should leave.

322
00:42:07,283 --> 00:42:08,743
Listen.

323
00:42:08,953 --> 00:42:12,043
See those guys over there
paying the check?

324
00:42:14,424 --> 00:42:17,464
- Yes.
- Okay. If the guy on the right pays. . .

325
00:42:17,715 --> 00:42:21,595
. . .we leave right now.
If the guy on the left pays. . .

326
00:42:21,885 --> 00:42:23,685
. . .we stay.

327
00:42:25,975 --> 00:42:27,935
And I kiss you.

328
00:42:28,645 --> 00:42:30,275
No.

329
00:42:37,737 --> 00:42:39,487
Give me that.

330
00:42:42,248 --> 00:42:43,618
I win.

331
00:42:47,288 --> 00:42:49,788
- No.
- C'est la vie.

332
00:42:50,128 --> 00:42:53,218
Don't do it. Don't.

333
00:44:07,967 --> 00:44:10,837
- Room for two?
- Of course.

334
00:44:47,883 --> 00:44:50,593
Nice music. What is it?

335
00:44:52,393 --> 00:44:54,263
It's. . .

336
00:44:54,473 --> 00:44:57,143
. . .African, I think.

337
00:44:58,524 --> 00:45:00,274
I like it.

338
00:45:27,138 --> 00:45:28,558
Here.

339
00:46:00,551 --> 00:46:02,671
Let's go to bed.

340
00:46:02,921 --> 00:46:05,341
- Come on.
- Stay here with me.

341
00:46:05,592 --> 00:46:08,012
- I'm cold.
- Stay.

342
00:46:12,893 --> 00:46:15,443
- Stay here with me.
- I'm cold.

343
00:46:16,234 --> 00:46:17,524
Let's go.

344
00:46:45,227 --> 00:46:47,057
How about lunch today?

345
00:46:47,307 --> 00:46:49,107
You free?

346
00:46:49,437 --> 00:46:53,277
I have all this fundraiser stuff.
Auction things to pick up.

347
00:46:53,527 --> 00:46:57,197
We can do an early one if you want.
How about 12:00?

348
00:46:57,449 --> 00:46:59,069
12:00?

349
00:46:59,279 --> 00:47:00,279
Yeah.

350
00:47:04,289 --> 00:47:06,709
Will I be hungry at 12:00?

351
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,220
We could go in together.

352
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:18,300
I'll wait for you.

353
00:47:19,802 --> 00:47:24,142
- I won't be ready for another hour.
- That's all right. I'll wait.

354
00:47:37,993 --> 00:47:39,783
- Oh, shit.
- What?

355
00:47:39,993 --> 00:47:41,783
I just remembered. . .

356
00:47:43,374 --> 00:47:47,164
. . .I have a facial at 12:30
at Georgianna's today.

357
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:49,585
Oh, well.

358
00:47:51,175 --> 00:47:53,555
You gotta stay beautiful, right?

359
00:47:57,886 --> 00:48:00,016
Georgianna's, huh?

360
00:48:02,266 --> 00:48:03,646
Waste of money.

361
00:48:21,538 --> 00:48:23,458
Yeah, Manhattan.

362
00:48:24,379 --> 00:48:27,799
A beauty salon called Georgina.

363
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:33,430
Oh, yeah, right. Yes, Georgianna's.
That's right.

364
00:48:35,641 --> 00:48:37,101
Thank you.

365
00:48:43,811 --> 00:48:48,531
Hello, I'm calling to confirm
an appointment today at 12:30.

366
00:48:49,112 --> 00:48:51,322
Sumner. Connie Sumner.

367
00:48:51,573 --> 00:48:53,283
S-U-M-N-E-R.

368
00:48:57,953 --> 00:49:02,333
Could she be down for another time?

369
00:49:07,254 --> 00:49:08,964
No, thank you.

370
00:49:30,947 --> 00:49:32,747
Connie?
It's Connie.

371
00:49:32,997 --> 00:49:34,417
Connie?

372
00:49:35,707 --> 00:49:36,917
Tracy?

373
00:49:37,127 --> 00:49:40,007
- Hi. I was gonna call you.
- They all say that. . .

374
00:49:40,259 --> 00:49:44,629
. . .when I call about bunny costumes.
You know Sally from Planned Parenthood.

375
00:49:44,839 --> 00:49:46,969
- Hi. It's been a while.
- Too long.

376
00:49:47,469 --> 00:49:50,019
- You look amazing.
- So where you headed?

377
00:49:50,269 --> 00:49:54,519
I was going to look for some
window shades for the kitchen.

378
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:58,570
We're gonna go and have coffee.
Why don't you join us?

379
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:02,610
- Oh, I'm gonna be late.
- For window shades?

380
00:50:03,322 --> 00:50:05,782
- Come on.
- Okay.

381
00:50:11,492 --> 00:50:13,622
Hi, how are you?

382
00:50:19,673 --> 00:50:21,963
I'm just gonna make a phone call.

383
00:50:22,173 --> 00:50:24,633
- Sure.
- Let me get that for you.

384
00:50:25,684 --> 00:50:29,014
- She could've used my cell phone.
- Oh, you're right.

385
00:50:32,185 --> 00:50:33,895
Hi, it's me.

386
00:50:34,145 --> 00:50:38,315
You won't believe this.
I'm at that cafe around the corner.

387
00:50:38,565 --> 00:50:42,655
Why do you introduce me
as Sally from Planned Parenthood?

388
00:50:42,906 --> 00:50:45,866
It makes it sound like
I'm handing out condoms.

389
00:50:46,366 --> 00:50:48,456
I'm stuck here.

390
00:50:50,707 --> 00:50:52,497
Will you wait for me?

391
00:50:52,877 --> 00:50:54,087
Wait for me.

392
00:50:59,428 --> 00:51:03,428
I called Gloria to remind her
to pick up the dry cleaning.

393
00:51:06,389 --> 00:51:08,769
Charlie is so adorable.

394
00:51:09,019 --> 00:51:10,519
Thank you.

395
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:29,081
I can't eat.

396
00:51:31,131 --> 00:51:35,011
- I'll have a coffee.
- Well, I guess I'll have coffee too.

397
00:51:35,923 --> 00:51:38,723
Excuse me again. Ladies' room.

398
00:51:42,303 --> 00:51:43,893
God, she looks good.

399
00:51:44,104 --> 00:51:48,314
- You think she's had work?
- Why would she? She's still gorgeous.

400
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:51,484
They do it early now
before it goes to shit.

401
00:52:07,256 --> 00:52:10,086
I have friends out there.

402
00:52:16,557 --> 00:52:18,927
You take me to the best places.

403
00:52:21,017 --> 00:52:22,477
Let me.

404
00:52:26,859 --> 00:52:30,779
- She's not like that. She's really nice.
- Of course she is.

405
00:52:30,989 --> 00:52:34,279
That makes it worse.
She's nice and she's sweet.

406
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:38,120
And her ass is in exactly
the same place it was in college.

407
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:46,460
Are you taking tennis?

408
00:52:46,711 --> 00:52:50,591
Oh, I wouldn't call what I do
"taking tennis. "

409
00:52:53,432 --> 00:52:57,472
- There you are. I was starting to worry.
- No, I'm fine.

410
00:52:57,682 --> 00:53:00,482
We thought that heartthrob
abducted you.

411
00:53:01,563 --> 00:53:02,643
What heartthrob?

412
00:53:03,353 --> 00:53:07,023
You didn't see him at the counter?
He was gorgeous.

413
00:53:07,863 --> 00:53:10,823
- I miss everything.
- Your button's undone.

414
00:53:11,034 --> 00:53:13,364
Oh. Thank you.

415
00:53:18,415 --> 00:53:20,125
That's him.

416
00:53:28,716 --> 00:53:30,266
I can see the appeal.

417
00:53:30,516 --> 00:53:33,266
If he looked at me twice,
I'd be on my back.

418
00:53:33,517 --> 00:53:35,847
- You would not.
- I would so. Why not?

419
00:53:36,097 --> 00:53:38,857
A couple of reasons:
Adam and your kids.

420
00:53:39,228 --> 00:53:42,148
You know, Trace,
they wouldn't have to know.

421
00:53:42,398 --> 00:53:47,368
It could be something I did for myself,
to broaden my horizons.

422
00:53:47,568 --> 00:53:49,528
Like taking a pottery class.

423
00:53:50,038 --> 00:53:53,158
- An affair isn't like taking pottery.
- Could be.

424
00:53:53,409 --> 00:53:57,249
It would start out like that.
Then something would happen. . .

425
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:02,880
. . .someone finds out or someone
falls in love and it ends disastrously.

426
00:54:04,221 --> 00:54:06,891
They always end disastrously.

427
00:54:18,612 --> 00:54:20,192
No.

428
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:22,073
When?

429
00:54:22,783 --> 00:54:24,993
It was a long time ago.

430
00:54:25,243 --> 00:54:29,413
And it's the one thing in my life
I would undo if I could.

431
00:54:37,254 --> 00:54:40,094
Did you just fuck me
across the street?

432
00:54:41,545 --> 00:54:42,595
I did.

433
00:54:43,676 --> 00:54:46,936
We could end this now
and no one would get hurt.

434
00:54:47,186 --> 00:54:52,316
Yeah. I think if we ended this now,
I'd get hurt.

435
00:54:53,777 --> 00:54:58,277
- So no matter what, someone gets hurt?
- Maybe not.

436
00:54:58,487 --> 00:55:01,197
Maybe we'll get tired of each other.

437
00:55:01,447 --> 00:55:04,197
God, I hope I get tired of you.

438
00:55:08,369 --> 00:55:10,499
You're in my mind.

439
00:55:10,749 --> 00:55:15,879
You're the only thing in my mind
when I wake up every morning.

440
00:55:17,169 --> 00:55:20,389
You're in my brain
before I even open my eyes.

441
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,470
- What do you think of?
- That depends.

442
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:28,810
If it's a day when I don't know if I'm
gonna get to see you, I'm anxious. . .

443
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:32,520
. . .thinking of excuses to come to
the city to see you.

444
00:55:36,612 --> 00:55:38,822
And the days you know we'll meet?

445
00:55:39,032 --> 00:55:40,822
On those days. . .

446
00:55:41,912 --> 00:55:43,332
. . .I'm. . .

447
00:55:44,123 --> 00:55:47,583
. . .calm and hating myself.

448
00:55:58,055 --> 00:56:00,555
This is what we have over here.

449
00:56:00,885 --> 00:56:03,555
I'll have it ready for you
this afternoon.

450
00:56:07,395 --> 00:56:10,235
Ed, what's up? Sounded important.

451
00:56:11,526 --> 00:56:16,196
I've heard you're talking with
Dunbar and Brinks and other companies.

452
00:56:16,446 --> 00:56:18,196
Where did you hear that?

453
00:56:19,367 --> 00:56:20,707
Well, look.

454
00:56:20,957 --> 00:56:24,997
I suppose they could be wooing me,
if that's what you mean.

455
00:56:25,248 --> 00:56:29,708
Apparently a lot of people
are wooing you. Or who's wooing who?

456
00:56:30,258 --> 00:56:33,888
What are you talking about?
So I talked to some people.

457
00:56:34,139 --> 00:56:36,889
- So what?
- This is about loyalty, Bill.

458
00:56:37,849 --> 00:56:42,559
I'm letting you go. You'll have
my recommendation if you need it.

459
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:47,230
I have a family, Ed.

460
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:50,151
You had a family here.

461
00:56:50,401 --> 00:56:54,411
No, wait a minute.
You're telling me about family?

462
00:56:55,031 --> 00:56:58,451
You don't know the first
goddamn thing about it.

463
00:57:02,962 --> 00:57:05,632
Look at your own fucking family, Ed.

464
00:57:05,793 --> 00:57:08,553
Take a goddamn look at that.

465
00:57:27,236 --> 00:57:29,196
- Ed.
- Frank.

466
00:57:31,826 --> 00:57:34,576
Thanks for coming on such short notice.

467
00:57:34,906 --> 00:57:37,576
This is personal, it's not business.

468
00:57:38,287 --> 00:57:41,707
Think about it.
You might not want to get involved.

469
00:57:41,957 --> 00:57:44,127
But I need someone I can trust.

470
00:57:44,337 --> 00:57:46,797
I want you to follow somebody.

471
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:52,257
I want you to follow my wife.

472
00:58:03,909 --> 00:58:05,900
- It's burning, Mom.
- What?

473
00:58:06,397 --> 00:58:08,895
It's burning. The chicken.

474
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,662
Shit.

475
00:58:22,848 --> 00:58:25,794
It's boiling, Mom. It's boiling!

476
00:58:26,045 --> 00:58:27,707
Thank you.

477
00:58:31,403 --> 00:58:33,105
Watch it. Watch it.

478
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,980
Chicken's a little dry. I'm sorry.

479
00:58:49,241 --> 00:58:50,781
It's fine.

480
00:58:55,623 --> 00:58:58,583
I have to go to Chicago tomorrow.

481
00:58:59,753 --> 00:59:02,923
- For how long?
- Not long. Probably just a night.

482
00:59:03,124 --> 00:59:05,084
What time's your flight?

483
00:59:05,546 --> 00:59:07,256
Eight o'clock.

484
00:59:08,217 --> 00:59:09,927
A.M.?

485
00:59:12,887 --> 00:59:16,437
Dianne Dreyer's son is marrying
Amy Lynn's daughter.

486
00:59:16,648 --> 00:59:19,528
- I'm never getting married.
- Why not?

487
00:59:20,109 --> 00:59:22,399
I hate girls.

488
00:59:24,161 --> 00:59:27,951
You might change your mind.
That happens sometimes.

489
00:59:28,162 --> 00:59:29,162
I won't.

490
00:59:34,174 --> 00:59:37,634
- What?
- I fired Bill Stone today.

491
00:59:38,844 --> 00:59:42,214
- That's what's bothering you?
- Nothing's bothering me.

492
00:59:43,057 --> 00:59:45,057
Why did you fire him?

493
00:59:46,808 --> 00:59:50,518
- He's not accountable.
- What's accountable?

494
00:59:50,938 --> 00:59:54,488
- Isn't it like people who eat people?
- No.

495
00:59:54,739 --> 00:59:57,319
That's a cannibal, honey.

496
00:59:58,950 --> 01:00:01,870
Anyway, I can't trust him anymore.

497
01:00:02,542 --> 01:00:05,002
So if you run into Dolly, you'll know.

498
01:01:42,331 --> 01:01:45,001
- What?
- I can't believe you!

499
01:01:45,211 --> 01:01:46,801
What did I do?

500
01:02:13,459 --> 01:02:14,959
Shit!

501
01:02:17,001 --> 01:02:18,341
Shit!

502
01:02:34,066 --> 01:02:35,606
Come on!

503
01:02:56,432 --> 01:02:59,392
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

504
01:03:00,103 --> 01:03:01,893
Honey, you okay?

505
01:03:02,103 --> 01:03:06,712
- You must have been so worried.
- Stop, Mom. People can see.

506
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:34,028
Hi, this is Paul Martel.
Leave a message after the beep.

507
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,619
Mom?

508
01:03:37,658 --> 01:03:40,036
You're supposed to be in bed.

509
01:03:40,248 --> 01:03:43,876
- You're crying, Mom.
- Oh, honey.

510
01:03:44,457 --> 01:03:49,294
Mommy's just a little sad, that's all.
Come on, I'll take you bed.

511
01:03:49,547 --> 01:03:51,376
Let's get you into bed.

512
01:03:51,627 --> 01:03:55,175
Don't be sad, Mom.
Dad will be home tomorrow.

513
01:04:04,224 --> 01:04:06,932
His name is Paul Martel.

514
01:04:11,605 --> 01:04:14,983
He lives at 433 Mercer Street,
Apartment 3.

515
01:04:16,113 --> 01:04:18,781
She sees him during the day.

516
01:04:19,192 --> 01:04:21,401
Usually goes around lunchtime.

517
01:04:22,282 --> 01:04:25,570
Stays about two hours, maybe three.

518
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:40,589
They go to the movies?

519
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:44,427
They did that day.
Otherwise, they're in his place.

520
01:05:58,068 --> 01:05:59,277
Pick up.

521
01:06:22,096 --> 01:06:23,425
Hey, lady!

522
01:06:24,385 --> 01:06:25,634
Forgot your keys.

523
01:07:07,589 --> 01:07:08,928
Wait!

524
01:07:10,339 --> 01:07:12,887
Who is she? Who is she?

525
01:07:13,138 --> 01:07:16,056
Calm down! What are you doing?

526
01:07:19,978 --> 01:07:22,686
How many are there? Five, ten?

527
01:07:24,357 --> 01:07:28,145
What am I, the Monday one?
Did I get my day wrong?

528
01:07:28,395 --> 01:07:31,903
She's just a friend, okay?
Just a friend.

529
01:07:33,025 --> 01:07:37,403
- You're a fucking liar.
- Me? I'm the liar?

530
01:07:37,905 --> 01:07:40,034
I can't do this anymore.

531
01:07:42,454 --> 01:07:46,042
Fine. Go back to your suburb
and car pool, your tennis...

532
01:07:46,243 --> 01:07:48,082
What are you doing?

533
01:07:48,963 --> 01:07:51,881
- Fuck you.
- That'll make you happy.

534
01:07:52,292 --> 01:07:53,881
Fuck you.

535
01:08:01,471 --> 01:08:02,840
No, I can't.

536
01:08:03,051 --> 01:08:05,389
Paul, it's over.

537
01:08:07,719 --> 01:08:09,138
I can't.

538
01:08:15,270 --> 01:08:18,108
- I hate you. I hate you.
- I know.

539
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:20,068
Stop it, I can't.

540
01:08:40,836 --> 01:08:43,504
- Are you gonna fuck me?
- You want me to?

541
01:08:43,675 --> 01:08:45,424
- I want you to.
- Say it.

542
01:08:45,674 --> 01:08:47,383
- I want you to fuck me.
- Say it.

543
01:08:47,595 --> 01:08:49,134
I want you to fuck me.

544
01:10:41,858 --> 01:10:44,436
Thank you. Thank you very much.

545
01:10:44,689 --> 01:10:47,447
Thank you very much, indeed.

546
01:11:08,385 --> 01:11:09,384
Yes?

547
01:11:11,674 --> 01:11:13,713
- You're Paul Martel?
- Yes.

548
01:11:15,014 --> 01:11:16,933
How old are you?

549
01:11:19,683 --> 01:11:21,432
Who are you?

550
01:11:21,764 --> 01:11:22,933
Edward Sumner.

551
01:11:25,602 --> 01:11:27,441
Connie's husband.

552
01:11:34,321 --> 01:11:35,740
May I. . .?

553
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,109
May I come in?

554
01:11:39,951 --> 01:11:41,950
Yeah. Sure.

555
01:12:10,476 --> 01:12:14,434
- Would you like a drink?
- Yeah, why not?

556
01:12:25,234 --> 01:12:28,862
I have Scotch, vodka, orange juice. . . .

557
01:12:29,113 --> 01:12:30,492
Vodka.

558
01:12:32,372 --> 01:12:33,371
Is it cold?

559
01:12:34,912 --> 01:12:35,951
Yeah.

560
01:12:38,003 --> 01:12:39,832
I keep it in the freezer.

561
01:12:40,082 --> 01:12:42,830
So do I, at home.

562
01:13:00,599 --> 01:13:02,898
So tell me, how did you. . .

563
01:13:03,149 --> 01:13:04,268
. . .meet my wife?

564
01:13:06,568 --> 01:13:08,277
By accident.

565
01:13:08,527 --> 01:13:12,485
On the street. There was
a windstorm, she hurt her knee and. . . .

566
01:13:14,067 --> 01:13:15,526
You're him.

567
01:13:15,777 --> 01:13:17,696
She told you about that?

568
01:13:18,327 --> 01:13:19,536
Yes.

569
01:13:25,376 --> 01:13:27,165
How's it going?

570
01:13:29,255 --> 01:13:32,213
Fine. Fine. I mean, okay.

571
01:13:33,084 --> 01:13:36,502
- This is where you meet?
- Yes.

572
01:13:37,714 --> 01:13:40,972
- She likes it?
- I guess. She never complained.

573
01:13:45,392 --> 01:13:49,640
Do you stay in all the time,
or do you go out too?

574
01:13:50,062 --> 01:13:52,560
It depends. Sometimes we go out.

575
01:13:52,772 --> 01:13:54,731
And she likes that?

576
01:13:56,861 --> 01:13:58,980
She likes this neighborhood?

577
01:14:00,150 --> 01:14:03,028
More exciting than the suburbs,
I guess.

578
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:11,538
Do you know we have been
married 11 years?

579
01:14:11,959 --> 01:14:13,208
We have a son.

580
01:14:15,329 --> 01:14:16,878
She told me.

581
01:14:20,088 --> 01:14:21,547
More?

582
01:14:22,377 --> 01:14:23,926
Yes, please.

583
01:14:37,055 --> 01:14:39,853
He's the reason that we left the city.

584
01:14:40,275 --> 01:14:42,933
Connie thought it'd be better for him.

585
01:14:43,194 --> 01:14:45,852
She told me it was your idea.

586
01:14:48,324 --> 01:14:51,192
You talk about me?

587
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:11,799
A lot of books.

588
01:15:12,630 --> 01:15:15,628
A lot of buying and selling.

589
01:15:55,964 --> 01:15:58,292
I didn't know it did that.

590
01:16:04,133 --> 01:16:07,131
- Where did you get this?
- It was a gift.

591
01:16:07,723 --> 01:16:09,182
From her.

592
01:16:22,571 --> 01:16:26,279
- Why would she do that?
- I don't know.

593
01:16:27,069 --> 01:16:30,277
Maybe she just wanted
to buy me something.

594
01:16:34,999 --> 01:16:38,287
She didn't buy this for you.
I gave it to her.

595
01:16:46,087 --> 01:16:48,505
- I can't do this.
- What?

596
01:16:49,087 --> 01:16:52,715
I can't do this. I can't do this.

597
01:16:57,174 --> 01:17:00,392
I'm feeling sick. I can't...

598
01:17:01,096 --> 01:17:02,975
You want some water?

599
01:17:04,264 --> 01:17:06,982
I'm feeling sick. I'm...

600
01:17:08,064 --> 01:17:09,563
I feel...

601
01:17:14,443 --> 01:17:17,241
I'm not well. I'm not feeling well.

602
01:17:23,162 --> 01:17:24,741
I'm not...

603
01:17:25,161 --> 01:17:27,200
I'm not feeling...

604
01:18:25,133 --> 01:18:26,672
God!

605
01:18:54,699 --> 01:18:56,278
You can't die.

606
01:21:04,641 --> 01:21:08,479
Hi, this is Paul Martel.
Leave a message after the beep.

607
01:21:09,269 --> 01:21:11,188
Hi, it's me.

608
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:12,939
Listen.

609
01:21:14,359 --> 01:21:17,697
I don't like saying this
to your machine...

610
01:21:19,278 --> 01:21:22,026
...but I have to end this.

611
01:21:24,828 --> 01:21:28,456
I just... I can't do it anymore.

612
01:21:28,667 --> 01:21:31,165
I can't live like this.

613
01:21:31,417 --> 01:21:36,544
I'm so tired of lying
and hurting my family.

614
01:21:37,046 --> 01:21:38,795
I'm sorry.

615
01:21:39,625 --> 01:21:41,344
And I hope...

616
01:21:41,715 --> 01:21:43,964
I don't know what I hope.

617
01:21:45,015 --> 01:21:46,674
I'm sorry.

618
01:22:54,735 --> 01:22:57,323
Messages erased.

619
01:23:10,912 --> 01:23:12,041
Does that pinch?

620
01:23:12,422 --> 01:23:13,541
No.

621
01:23:13,881 --> 01:23:16,919
- Do you know your solo?
- Yep.

622
01:23:17,172 --> 01:23:18,631
Can I hear it?

623
01:24:48,288 --> 01:24:51,126
- Need a hand?
- No, I'm fine.

624
01:24:51,588 --> 01:24:52,877
Thanks.

625
01:26:16,036 --> 01:26:17,865
Where were you?

626
01:26:18,456 --> 01:26:19,875
You okay?

627
01:27:54,493 --> 01:27:57,621
You were spectacular, you know that?

628
01:27:58,082 --> 01:28:00,121
- Wasn't he great?
- Great.

629
01:28:01,162 --> 01:28:03,381
He was great. Great.

630
01:28:04,081 --> 01:28:05,460
Really great.

631
01:28:06,251 --> 01:28:11,298
I have to help clean up. I'll kiss
you good night when I get home, okay?

632
01:28:19,519 --> 01:28:23,437
- Sorry, Ed. Looks like I nailed you.
- It's all right.

633
01:28:24,978 --> 01:28:26,977
It's all right, Jerry.

634
01:28:33,567 --> 01:28:36,575
You better check to see
if this will open.

635
01:28:36,827 --> 01:28:39,325
It's nothing. This is fine.

636
01:28:44,075 --> 01:28:48,493
- Did he dent you, Dad?
- Yes, he did. Yes.

637
01:28:48,705 --> 01:28:50,954
Can we call the cops, Dad?

638
01:28:53,044 --> 01:28:55,962
- Let's check the trunk.
- We'll talk tomorrow.

639
01:28:56,213 --> 01:28:58,502
- It'll just take a second.
- No!

640
01:32:04,537 --> 01:32:05,666
Oh, my God.

641
01:32:05,878 --> 01:32:10,296
Charlie, look at your dad
and tell me what's wrong.

642
01:32:12,506 --> 01:32:13,885
What?

643
01:32:15,555 --> 01:32:19,013
His shoes. They're different colors.

644
01:32:26,974 --> 01:32:28,893
Honey, you look awful.

645
01:32:29,143 --> 01:32:33,481
What happened last night? Did you
sleep? I got up and looked for you.

646
01:32:33,733 --> 01:32:35,442
I just. . .

647
01:32:36,902 --> 01:32:37,941
. . .got some air.

648
01:32:38,902 --> 01:32:40,821
Are you okay?

649
01:32:41,911 --> 01:32:43,120
Yeah.

650
01:32:55,209 --> 01:32:56,958
Do you like it here?

651
01:32:57,420 --> 01:33:00,668
What? Of course I like it here.

652
01:33:00,969 --> 01:33:05,177
We don't have to stay here.
We can move back to the city.

653
01:33:06,508 --> 01:33:09,886
Honey, what has gotten into you?

654
01:33:11,348 --> 01:33:13,397
Are you okay?

655
01:33:13,597 --> 01:33:16,435
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. Fine.

656
01:33:18,856 --> 01:33:21,894
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

657
01:33:23,236 --> 01:33:26,864
Everybody's fine.
And we're not moving anywhere.

658
01:34:09,359 --> 01:34:11,777
The cops are here, Mom.

659
01:34:12,989 --> 01:34:16,197
- What do they want?
- I'm sure it's nothing.

660
01:34:22,997 --> 01:34:24,916
N.Y.P.D., Mom.

661
01:34:27,787 --> 01:34:33,164
Mrs. Sumner? I'm Detective Dean,
this is Detective Mirojnick, N.Y.P.D.

662
01:34:33,336 --> 01:34:36,044
Something happen?
Is something wrong?

663
01:34:36,295 --> 01:34:38,883
Do you know a Paul Martel?

664
01:34:39,216 --> 01:34:45,093
- Yes, not very well. Why?
- Do you know where he is?

665
01:34:46,344 --> 01:34:47,973
No.

666
01:34:50,313 --> 01:34:52,472
At home, I would imagine.

667
01:34:52,684 --> 01:34:54,483
Do you know where he lives?

668
01:34:54,693 --> 01:34:56,772
SoHo, isn't it?

669
01:34:57,813 --> 01:35:01,441
Your name and number
were found on his desk.

670
01:35:02,652 --> 01:35:04,951
- Has he done something wrong?
- We don't know.

671
01:35:05,152 --> 01:35:07,910
He's been reported
missing by his family.

672
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:10,578
His wife doesn't know where he is.

673
01:35:13,450 --> 01:35:15,828
I didn't know he was married.

674
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:17,749
Separated.

675
01:35:22,708 --> 01:35:24,797
When did you see him last?

676
01:35:26,338 --> 01:35:28,926
I don't know, it's hard to say.

677
01:35:31,348 --> 01:35:32,887
He's a book dealer.

678
01:35:33,098 --> 01:35:36,176
I barely know him.
I was going to buy books from him.

679
01:35:36,727 --> 01:35:40,435
- And did you?
- No, not yet.

680
01:35:43,026 --> 01:35:45,894
Has something happened?
You think he's all right?

681
01:35:46,105 --> 01:35:48,773
It's hard to say at this point.

682
01:35:48,986 --> 01:35:50,945
We're working on it.

683
01:35:52,405 --> 01:35:56,283
- Anyway, thanks. Thanks for your time.
- Thank you.

684
01:35:56,535 --> 01:36:00,533
I like these snow-glass things.
My boy has some of these.

685
01:36:00,743 --> 01:36:04,541
- If you hear from him, let us know.
- Certainly.

686
01:36:32,229 --> 01:36:34,478
Dad! Cops came to our house today.

687
01:36:36,938 --> 01:36:38,567
Cops? What did they want?

688
01:36:43,327 --> 01:36:44,366
Someone's missing.

689
01:36:44,868 --> 01:36:47,746
And they have to check everyone,
you know.

690
01:36:52,126 --> 01:36:53,165
Who was it?

691
01:36:54,456 --> 01:36:56,585
Honey, sit up straight.

692
01:36:59,375 --> 01:37:02,583
- Who was it?
- I don't think you know him.

693
01:37:02,795 --> 01:37:04,844
He sells books.

694
01:37:05,054 --> 01:37:06,963
I forget where I met him.

695
01:37:07,804 --> 01:37:10,302
Was it a bad guy, Mom?

696
01:37:12,764 --> 01:37:16,102
Why did they want to talk to you?

697
01:37:16,312 --> 01:37:19,390
I guess he had my name and number.

698
01:37:20,772 --> 01:37:23,860
Why would he have your number?

699
01:37:24,482 --> 01:37:26,781
I think I bought a book from him.

700
01:37:39,119 --> 01:37:42,287
- Be careful. Take it easy.
- Hey, Charlie!

701
01:37:42,669 --> 01:37:45,497
Oh, my darling.
Oh, I wished you lived closer.

702
01:37:49,878 --> 01:37:54,296
Lord, bless this food to our use,
and us to thy service.

703
01:37:55,097 --> 01:37:59,385
And help us be ever mindful
of the needs of others. Amen.

704
01:37:59,598 --> 01:38:01,687
Amen.

705
01:38:01,887 --> 01:38:03,646
Very nice, Edward.

706
01:38:13,984 --> 01:38:15,313
All right!

707
01:38:24,074 --> 01:38:27,912
I have a story you don't know
about Edward. Gather close.

708
01:39:15,827 --> 01:39:17,786
Hello, Mrs. Sumner.

709
01:39:17,996 --> 01:39:22,044
Sorry to bother you on the weekend.
I'm Detective Dean.

710
01:39:22,255 --> 01:39:24,713
- This is Detective Mirojnick, N.Y.P.D.
- Okay.

711
01:39:24,874 --> 01:39:28,172
We were hoping
to talk to you for a few minutes.

712
01:39:28,754 --> 01:39:29,883
Sure.

713
01:39:30,094 --> 01:39:32,972
- Charlie, we're going up on the porch.
- Can I come?

714
01:39:33,223 --> 01:39:37,511
No, sweetheart. Stay out here.
Play with Poppy, we'll be right back.

715
01:39:38,302 --> 01:39:42,220
I don't know if your wife mentioned,
we were here a week ago.

716
01:39:42,432 --> 01:39:43,731
About Paul Martel.

717
01:39:43,932 --> 01:39:45,851
Yeah, the man who was missing.

718
01:39:46,061 --> 01:39:51,728
Well, he's not missing anymore.
His body was discovered last weekend.

719
01:39:52,281 --> 01:39:54,190
God, that's terrible.

720
01:39:57,160 --> 01:39:58,369
Oh, my God.

721
01:39:58,569 --> 01:40:02,907
Do you recall where
you met Mr. Martel, Mrs. Sumner?

722
01:40:03,578 --> 01:40:06,286
- I told you.
- No, ma'am, you didn't.

723
01:40:06,499 --> 01:40:08,538
I'm sorry.

724
01:40:08,708 --> 01:40:10,587
I can't remember.

725
01:40:11,208 --> 01:40:13,087
A fundraiser, I think.

726
01:40:13,298 --> 01:40:15,047
Can you be more specific?

727
01:40:15,257 --> 01:40:16,256
Juilliard.

728
01:40:18,588 --> 01:40:19,677
Juilliard?

729
01:40:20,597 --> 01:40:21,676
The music school.

730
01:40:22,506 --> 01:40:26,344
- Yes, I know what Juilliard is.
- Of course you do. I'm sorry.

731
01:40:26,595 --> 01:40:28,724
Were you there too, sir?

732
01:40:30,186 --> 01:40:32,974
Yes. Yes, I think I was.

733
01:40:33,186 --> 01:40:35,684
Well, maybe you met Mr. Martel.

734
01:40:37,314 --> 01:40:39,233
No. No, not that I remember.

735
01:40:39,444 --> 01:40:41,653
Maybe you'd recognize him.

736
01:40:42,614 --> 01:40:44,783
No, I've never met him before.

737
01:40:44,993 --> 01:40:47,741
- Is that him?
- Yes. Yes.

738
01:40:48,663 --> 01:40:51,331
You ever been to his apartment?

739
01:40:51,453 --> 01:40:52,912
No.

740
01:40:53,122 --> 01:40:54,791
No, I hardly knew him.

741
01:40:55,002 --> 01:40:58,870
- I didn't know why he had my number.
- Maybe he liked you.

742
01:40:59,081 --> 01:41:00,880
Look, that's enough.

743
01:41:04,210 --> 01:41:07,878
So you've never been to his apartment.
How about the neighborhood?

744
01:41:08,091 --> 01:41:09,760
- Hang out down there?
- No.

745
01:41:10,011 --> 01:41:11,760
No, not often. . .

746
01:41:11,970 --> 01:41:12,969
. . .or no, never.

747
01:41:13,179 --> 01:41:17,057
Never. I can't remember the
last time I was in SoHo.

748
01:41:17,269 --> 01:41:19,308
It was four weeks ago, actually.

749
01:41:22,148 --> 01:41:26,356
You got a parking ticket in front
of Martel's apartment, four weeks ago.

750
01:41:26,568 --> 01:41:31,815
Oh, that. Right. I had coffee
with friends at a little place.

751
01:41:32,026 --> 01:41:33,155
I forgot.

752
01:41:33,367 --> 01:41:36,445
- It was Tracy and Sally.
- Oh, yeah. Yes. Yep.

753
01:41:48,505 --> 01:41:50,504
Look. . .

754
01:41:51,674 --> 01:41:55,132
. . .my wife has told you everything
she knows, so have I.

755
01:41:56,053 --> 01:41:58,671
If you don't mind,
we'd like to get back to our son.

756
01:41:58,883 --> 01:42:00,842
All right.

757
01:42:01,053 --> 01:42:05,351
- Why don't I give you my card?
- I have your card.

758
01:42:06,431 --> 01:42:08,140
Right.

759
01:42:09,311 --> 01:42:11,689
- Enjoy your weekend.
- You too.

760
01:43:07,153 --> 01:43:09,402
Sumner, please.

761
01:43:48,267 --> 01:43:49,686
Oh, my God.

762
01:43:51,276 --> 01:43:52,735
Connie?

763
01:43:54,146 --> 01:43:55,775
Hi, Tracy.

764
01:43:55,985 --> 01:43:59,153
I'm just picking up
my silk suit for tonight.

765
01:44:01,155 --> 01:44:03,244
I was thinking of wearing the black.

766
01:44:16,044 --> 01:44:20,552
I'm giving it to Goodwill. Let someone
else be gorgeous for a change.

767
01:44:24,802 --> 01:44:28,640
What should we bring, aside
from our sparkling personalities?

768
01:44:32,521 --> 01:44:35,229
- How we doing?
- Fine.

769
01:44:35,441 --> 01:44:38,649
- Need help?
- No.

770
01:44:40,109 --> 01:44:44,986
Well, the white is not cold,
so I'm gonna put it in the freezer.

771
01:44:46,109 --> 01:44:48,817
Just remind me it's in there,
all right?

772
01:44:50,948 --> 01:44:53,536
Most people drink red anyway.

773
01:44:57,788 --> 01:45:01,456
I love these things. Is there any
place you guys haven't been?

774
01:45:01,667 --> 01:45:04,125
The Rosenthals got
795 for their place.

775
01:45:04,336 --> 01:45:08,174
- In two days they had six offers.
- Sealed bids is how they do it now.

776
01:45:08,386 --> 01:45:11,044
What do you think
this place is worth, Ed?

777
01:45:11,215 --> 01:45:14,763
I don't know. If you sell
your house, where do you go?

778
01:45:14,975 --> 01:45:18,263
- At those prices, Tahiti.
- Bangkok.

779
01:45:18,474 --> 01:45:20,972
Connie, where is this one from?

780
01:45:31,232 --> 01:45:33,071
Fiji.

781
01:45:33,733 --> 01:45:36,781
Remember, Jeff,
I asked you to take me to Fiji.

782
01:45:36,992 --> 01:45:41,699
And then you took me to Hawaii.
We went fishing every single. . . .

783
01:46:04,768 --> 01:46:07,057
What happened, Edward?

784
01:46:09,227 --> 01:46:11,226
What did you do?

785
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:14,147
Did you hurt him?

786
01:46:18,736 --> 01:46:20,155
Edward?

787
01:46:21,565 --> 01:46:23,484
Did you hurt him?

788
01:46:25,615 --> 01:46:27,324
You did, didn't you?

789
01:46:29,954 --> 01:46:32,452
Jesus, Edward.

790
01:46:33,414 --> 01:46:35,663
Talk to me.

791
01:46:35,874 --> 01:46:38,043
Tell me what you did!

792
01:46:38,254 --> 01:46:42,002
No, you tell me what you did.

793
01:46:42,422 --> 01:46:47,299
How you fucked him, over and over
and over. You lied to me!

794
01:46:47,512 --> 01:46:50,970
- Over and over and over.
- Edward, please...

795
01:46:51,182 --> 01:46:53,101
No, you don't talk to me now.

796
01:46:53,641 --> 01:46:56,009
I gave everything. . .

797
01:46:56,811 --> 01:46:58,980
. . .for this family.

798
01:46:59,429 --> 01:47:00,598
Everything.

799
01:47:02,310 --> 01:47:04,569
And what did you do?

800
01:47:05,650 --> 01:47:09,028
You threw it all away,
like it was nothing.

801
01:47:09,859 --> 01:47:11,448
For what?

802
01:47:12,198 --> 01:47:14,407
To the fucking kid.

803
01:47:22,706 --> 01:47:24,785
You didn't think I'd know?

804
01:47:24,996 --> 01:47:28,374
I wouldn't feel it?
I knew it from the very first day.

805
01:47:30,916 --> 01:47:35,344
Because I know you, Connie.
I know you and I fucking hate you.

806
01:47:35,545 --> 01:47:39,133
I didn't want to kill him,
I wanted to kill you!

807
01:47:41,634 --> 01:47:43,803
Oh, my God.

808
01:47:54,023 --> 01:47:57,321
Edward. Oh, my God.

809
01:48:08,121 --> 01:48:10,120
Oh, my God.

810
01:48:51,574 --> 01:48:54,662
Mom, look what I did.

811
01:48:57,374 --> 01:49:01,792
Honey, it's okay. That's okay.

812
01:49:02,003 --> 01:49:03,372
I'm sorry, Mom.

813
01:49:03,582 --> 01:49:07,540
It's an accident.
Everybody has accidents.

814
01:49:07,752 --> 01:49:09,881
Why aren't you in bed, Mom?

815
01:49:13,091 --> 01:49:14,420
I don't know.

816
01:49:18,721 --> 01:49:20,260
Charlie, look at me.

817
01:49:20,851 --> 01:49:22,980
I want you to know. . .

818
01:49:23,180 --> 01:49:27,228
. . .that I love you,
more than anything in the world.

819
01:49:29,568 --> 01:49:32,896
And I want you to know
that your daddy and me both. . .

820
01:49:33,108 --> 01:49:35,566
. . .will always, always love you.

821
01:49:35,778 --> 01:49:38,027
No matter what.

822
01:49:41,287 --> 01:49:44,075
- Okay?
- Okay.

823
01:49:44,327 --> 01:49:45,326
Come on, sweetie.

824
01:49:46,207 --> 01:49:50,914
Let's go fix up your bed
all nice and fresh, okay?

825
01:49:51,296 --> 01:49:52,955
All right.

826
01:53:04,708 --> 01:53:07,086
You can come on up
and clean it off, no?

827
01:53:07,288 --> 01:53:11,756
Come on.
I'm not an ax murderer. I promise.

828
01:53:20,967 --> 01:53:22,556
Taxi.

829
01:53:45,493 --> 01:53:48,081
Thank you.

830
01:54:14,179 --> 01:54:16,268
What are we going to do?

831
01:54:19,438 --> 01:54:21,976
I'm so scared.

832
01:54:24,027 --> 01:54:25,276
I'll turn myself in.

833
01:54:26,027 --> 01:54:27,486
No.

834
01:54:30,366 --> 01:54:31,865
No.

835
01:54:41,245 --> 01:54:43,793
No, we can get through this.

836
01:54:45,214 --> 01:54:47,882
We'll take it one day at a time.

837
01:54:49,633 --> 01:54:51,712
No one will know.

838
01:54:53,463 --> 01:54:55,512
We'll know.

839
01:55:03,812 --> 01:55:07,270
3200, 3500, 3800, 4000. . .

840
01:55:07,481 --> 01:55:09,650
. . .42, 45, 4800!

841
01:56:36,348 --> 01:56:38,597
We can disappear.

842
01:56:40,639 --> 01:56:42,518
We can raise some money.

843
01:56:42,728 --> 01:56:45,856
Sell everything
and just leave the country.

844
01:56:47,358 --> 01:56:48,897
Senorita?

845
01:56:49,857 --> 01:56:51,986
Mexico.

846
01:56:53,447 --> 01:56:55,276
Why not?

847
01:56:57,035 --> 01:56:59,154
We can get a little house
on the beach.

848
01:56:59,825 --> 01:57:01,864
Take a different name.

849
01:57:03,284 --> 01:57:04,953
People do it all the time.

850
01:57:06,126 --> 01:57:08,335
What will we tell Charlie?

851
01:57:10,214 --> 01:57:12,962
Tell him it's an adventure.

852
01:57:15,672 --> 01:57:18,050
We could fish all day.

853
01:57:21,552 --> 01:57:24,640
We could learn to play the guitar.

854
01:57:25,972 --> 01:57:30,390
I would serenade you
to sleep every night.

855
01:57:31,642 --> 01:57:34,980
We'll just live the rest of our lives
on that beach.

856
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:38,818
And then when we die,
we can just push out to sea.

857
01:57:39,359 --> 01:57:40,568
What do you think?

858
01:57:43,491 --> 01:57:45,410
Sounds perfect.
