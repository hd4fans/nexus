1
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,370
He is coming.

2
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,750
Cover your butt.

3
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,080
Cover the what?

4
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,260
Vitruvius.

5
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,800
Lord Business.

6
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,090
You've hidden the Kragle well, old man.

7
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,260
Robots, destroy him!

8
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,220
Yes, Lord Business.

9
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,480
Your robots are no match for a MasterBuilder.

10
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,020
For I see everything!

11
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,980
Unh! My eyes! Ow!

12
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,650
The Kragle. The most powerful super weapon...

13
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,490
...is mine.

14
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,450
Oh, the Kragle!

15
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,830
Now my evil power will be unlimited! Can you feel me?

16
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,910
I can feel you.

17
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,120
Whoo! Nothing's gonna stop me now.

18
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:25,870
Wait. There was a prophecy.

19
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,670
Oh, now there's a prophecy.

20
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,380
About the Piece of Resistance.

21
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,550
Oh, yes! The supposed missing Piece of Resistance...

22
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,130
...that can somehow magically disarm the Kragle.

23
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,970
Give me a break!

24
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,350
One day, a talented lass or fellow

25
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,850
A Special One with face of yellow

26
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,730
Will make the Piece of Resistance found

27
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,610
from its hiding refuge underground

28
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,860
And with a noble army at the helm

29
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,110
This MasterBuilder will thwart The Kragle and save the realm

30
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,660
And be the greatest most interesting

31
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,830
most important person of all times

32
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,830
All of this is true

33
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,660
Because it rhymes

34
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,670
Oh, wow.

35
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,050
That was a great, inspiring legend that you made up.

36
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,380
A "Special One"?

37
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:20,300
What a bunch of hippie-dippie baloney.

38
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,320
Good morning, apartment!

39
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,370
Good morning, doorway! Good morning, wall.

40
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,330
Good morning, ceiling. Good morning, floor!

41
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,580
Ready to start the day!

42
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,620
Ah, here it is!

43
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,880
"Instructions to fit in...

44
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,170
...have everybody like you...

45
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,630
...and always be happy!

46
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,050
Step one:

47
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,260
Breathe."

48
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,340
Okay, got that one down.

49
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,310
Step two: Greet the day, smile and say..."

50
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,560
Good morning, city!

51
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,850
- Good morning, city!   - Good morning, city!

52
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,940
- Good morning, city!   - Top of the morning to you there, city!

53
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,860
- Good morning, city! How you doing?   - Good morning, city!

54
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,490
Step three: Exercise."

55
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,400
Jumping jacks. Hit them!

56
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,740
One!

57
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,620
Two!

58
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:23,870
Three!

59
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,370
I am so pumped up!

60
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,040
Step four: Shower."

61
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,670
And always be sure to keep the soap out of your--! Aah!

62
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,460
Shave your face.

63
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,750
Brush your teeth.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,880
Comb your hair. Hmm.

65
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,050
"Wear clothes."

66
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,380
Oop! I almost forgot that one!

67
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,180
No. No. Uh-uh. No.

68
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,640
Not that. Wrong.

69
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,260
And that's it. Check.

70
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,600
Step nine: Eat a complete breakfast...

71
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:52,060
...with all the special people in your life.

72
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,400
Hey, Plantie, what do you wanna do this morning?

73
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,570
Watch TV? Me too!

74
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,490
Hi, I'm President Business...

75
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,820
president of the Octan Corporation and the world.

76
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,950
Let's take extra care to follow the instructions, or you'll be put to sleep.

77
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,450
And don't forget Taco Tuesday's coming next week!

78
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,460
That's the day every rule-following citizen gets a free taco and my love!

79
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,460
Have a great day, everybody!

80
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,710
You have a great day too, President Business.

81
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,090
Man, he's such a cool guy. I always wanna hear more of what--

82
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,710
Wait, did he say "put to sleep"?

83
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,420
Tonight on Where Are My Pants?

84
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:24,590
Honey, where are my pants?

85
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,600
What was I just thinking? I don't care.

86
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,100
Step 11: Greet your neighbors."

87
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,480
- Hey, Joe.   - Hey, pal.

88
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,190
Whoa! Hey, Surfer Dave.

89
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,320
Hey, brah.

90
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,980
- Oh, good morning, Sherrie.   - Hey, fella.

91
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,530
- Oh, hey, Jasmine, Dexter.

92
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,110
Angie, Loki, Bad Leroy.

93
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,320
Fluffy, Fluffy Junior, Fluffy Senior.

94
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,330
Jeff.

95
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,500
Step 12: Obey all traffic signs and regulations.

96
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,290
Step 13: Enjoy popular music.

97
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,500
Top of the charts again...

98
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,290
-...it's "Everything ls Awesome."   -Oh, my gosh, I love this song!

99
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,840
Everything is awesome

100
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,550
Everything is cool

101
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,300
When you're part of a team

102
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,140
Everything is awesome

103
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,800
When we're living our

104
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:08,640
Dream

105
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,390
Always use a turn signal.

106
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,680
Park between the lines. Yes!

107
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,190
Drop off dry-cleaning before noon.

108
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,350
Read the headlines.

109
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,520
Don't forget to smile.

110
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,270
Always root for the local sports team.

111
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,860
Go, Sports Team!

112
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,110
Always return a compliment.

113
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,940
- Hey, you look nice.   - So do you!

114
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,700
Drink overpriced coffee.

115
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,910
Here you go. That's $37.

116
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,570
Awesome!

117
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,660
Everything is awesome

118
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,000
Did you see Where Are My Pants? last night?

119
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,080
"Honey, where's my pants?"

120
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,380
Classic episode.

121
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,670
Everything is awesome

122
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,170
Instructions coming in from Central.

123
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,220
Okay, it says here to take everything weird and blow it up.

124
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,220
All right, Cylinderheads...

125
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,140
...let's make it look like it does in the instructions!

126
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:54,980
Hey, buddy!

127
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,600
I need a 1-by-2 key hole.

128
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:57,770
No problem, Michael.

129
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,360
We need a 2-by-2 macaroni.

130
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,440
- 2-by-2 macaroni flying in.   - Here's one.

131
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:04,690
Guys, got a 1-by-1 with an indented stud on one side.

132
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,740
- Cheese slopes. Come on, everybody.   - Roger that, Roger.

133
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,910
Look alive, coming at you.

134
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,200
Can I get a couple LURPs over here?

135
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,540
- Thanks, Gail.   - Guys, watch me drill this down.

136
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,250
Everything is awesome

137
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,830
Everything is cool When you're part of a team

138
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,670
Everything is awesome

139
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,170
When we're living our dream

140
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,960
Have you heard the news? Everyone's talkin'

141
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,220
Life is good Because everything's awesome

142
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:30,050
Man, I feel so good right now! I could sing this song for hours!

143
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,850
Everything is awesome

144
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,440
When we're living our dream

145
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,690
When you're part of a team!

146
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,860
Yeah!

147
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,820
I'm going to the sports bar after work tonight.

148
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:49,450
Who wants to eat some delicious chicken wings and get crazy?

149
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,030
Chicken wings? I love chicken wings!

150
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,030
Hey, who wants to share a croissant with this guy?

151
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,330
Croissants? I love croissants.

152
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,410
Oh, yeah! I sure do love giant sausages.

153
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,620
Giant sausages? No way!

154
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,420
You know what I love to do?

155
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,460
Is share a meal with the special people in my life.

156
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:02,960
Fred, Barry, Gail, me and you?

157
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,420
Ah! No, wait, guys!

158
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,920
Wait up! Okay, I'll meet you there.

159
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,510
Oh. Where did it go?

160
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,680
Oh, there you are.

161
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,020
I think I heard a whoosh.

162
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,230
Hey, pal, I hate to tell you this...

163
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,820
...but, uh, I don't think you're supposed to be here.

164
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,910
Yeah, the rules specifically state...

165
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,830
...work site closes at 6, it's a hard-hat area only.

166
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,910
That's not official safety orange.

167
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,040
"If you see anything weird, report it immediately."

168
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,210
Well, I guess I'm gonna...

169
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,760
...have to report youuu...

170
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,400
Where are you going? Miss! I didn't mean to scare you! I'm sor--

171
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,960
Hey! Heh. That's not so bad.

172
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,650
What is that?

173
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,860
Come here.

174
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,400
What do I do? I don't have my instructions.

175
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,240
Touch the Piece.

176
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,950
Touch the Piece. Touch the Piece.

177
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:04,500
I feel like maybe I should touch that.

178
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,540
It's so...

179
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,960
. . . interesting.

180
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,460
Touch the Piece.

181
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,380
It's so interesting.

182
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,760
Touch the Piece.

183
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,550
Touch the Piece.

184
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,020
Touch the Piece.

185
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,060
Touch the--

186
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,110
A Special One with face of yellow

187
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,610
Will make the Piece of Resistance found

188
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,440
From its hiding refuge underground

189
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:34,990
What's going on down here?

190
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,410
This MasterBuilder will thwart The Kragle and save the realm

191
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,580
Come on, Emmet!

192
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,870
The Special has arisen.

193
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,910
It's your turn to be the hero.

194
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,750
Wake up.

195
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,120
Come on, wake up!

196
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,460
Where are the MasterBuilders?

197
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,540
How did you find the Piece of Resistance? Eh?

198
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,960
- Where are the others hiding?   - Good morning, apartment?

199
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:53,960
Wake up!

200
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,970
How did you find the Piece of Resistance?

201
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,180
The piece of what?

202
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,260
The Piece of Resistance.

203
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,720
I-- I don't-- Where am I? What's happening?

204
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,890
"What's happening?"

205
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,940
Playing dumb, MasterBuilder.

206
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,560
No. I-- "MasterBuilder"?

207
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,400
- Oh. So you've never heard of the prophecy?    - No.

208
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,230
Or The Special?

209
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,150
No, no!

210
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,990
You're a liar! We'll kill you!

211
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,740
Look, urn, I watch a lot of cop shows on TV.

212
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,370
Isn't there supposed to also be--?

213
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,620
Isn't there supposed to be a good cop?

214
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,630
Oh, yes. But we're not done yet.

215
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,960
Hi, buddy! I'm your friendly neighborhood police officer!

216
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,300
- Would you like a glass of water?   - Yeah. Yeah, actually.

217
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,300
Too bad.

218
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,050
Security cameras picked up this.

219
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,060
Unh! You were found at the construction site convulsing with a strange piece.

220
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,220
That's disgusting!

221
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,810
Then why is it permanently stuck to your back?

222
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,980
Get it off me! Get it off me!

223
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,400
It won't come off! It's chasing me!

224
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,030
Look, it's not my fault!

225
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,940
I have no idea how this thing got on my back!

226
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,950
Of course, buddy. I believe you.

227
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,860
Great.

228
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,570
I "believe" you too.

229
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,240
You see the quotations I'm making with my claw hands?

230
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,700
It means I don't believe you!

231
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,620
Why else would you show up with that thing on your back...

232
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,540
...just three days before President Business...

233
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,000
...is going to use the Kragle to end the world?

234
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,300
President Business is gonna end the world?

235
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,840
But he's such a good guy.

236
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,260
And Octan, they make good stuff.

237
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,890
Music, dairy products, coffee, TV shows...

238
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,350
...surveillance systems, all history books, voting machines.

239
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,260
Wait a minute.

240
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,980
Come on, you can't be this stupid.

241
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,600
This is a misunderstanding.

242
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,650
I'm just a regular, normal, ordinary guy.

243
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,980
I'm late to meet my best friends in the whole world.

244
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,020
They're probably missing me right now.

245
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,730
They're probably out looking around.

246
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,110
"Hey, where's Emmet? Hey, where's my best friend Emmet?"

247
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,610
Hey, you know what? Ask all my friends. They'll tell you.

248
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,530
Oh, we asked them, all right.

249
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,950
That guy's not a criminal mastermind.

250
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,000
See?

251
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,670
Yeah. You know, he's kind of an average, normal kind of guy.

252
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,830
Thank you.

253
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:54,790
But, you know, he's not, like...

254
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,210
...normal like us. No.

255
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,170
He's not that special.

256
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,180
Wait, I'm so confused. Who are we talking about?

257
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,390
Wait, does he work with us?

258
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,970
Gail doesn't remember me?

259
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,100
Look at Randy here.

260
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,850
He likes sausage. That's something.

261
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,650
Gail is perky. That's something.

262
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,440
And Harry...

263
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:19,860
When you say Harry, I go: Haaa

264
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,490
When you say the other guy, I go:

265
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,660
Harry's the best!

266
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,030
- Harry's got personality.   - He's weird! He's weird!

267
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,450
I know that guy but I know, like, zippy-zap about him.

268
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,160
We just talked earlier.

269
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,210
I mean, all he does is say yes...

270
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,500
...to everything everybody else is doing.

271
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,880
You know, he's just sort of a "Hmm!"

272
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,840
Little bit of a blank slate, I guess.

273
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,890
That'll be $42, please.

274
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:49,100
We all have something that makes us something and Emmet is...

275
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,730
...nothing.

276
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,860
There you go.

277
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,110
I told you I was a nobody.

278
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,900
It's the perfect cover.

279
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,820
Cover? Cover for what?

280
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,660
I can't break him. Take him to the melting chamber.

281
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,740
What?

282
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,120
You're gonna melt me'? Am I gonna die?

283
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,710
You'll live. You'll be fine.

284
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,420
President Business. I have him right here, sir.

285
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:22,630
Yes, we've told him he'll live so he doesn't try to escape, but, um...

286
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,130
...we're lying to him.

287
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,890
Wait, what did he just say?

288
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,050
Hold still.

289
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,220
Wait! There's obviously been a mix-up here. You've got the wrong--

290
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,400
That is gonna start hurting pretty soon.

291
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,510
No, no, no!

292
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,850
Whoa. Who are you?

293
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,600
It's you?

294
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,600
Come with me if you wanna not die.

295
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,230
Hi, everybody! How's the melting goi--?

296
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,150
Hey, hey, hey”

297
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,240
Red alert, red alert.

298
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,950
I need everyone, repeat: everyone, to go after The Special.

299
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,330
The tunnel's that way.

300
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,410
Oh, boy!

301
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,250
Oh, sir, you're brilliant.

302
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,250
We'll build a motorcycle out of the alleyway.

303
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,430
So, uh, didn't catch your name...

304
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:58,020
...or anything about what you're, uh, up to.

305
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,690
Or what we're doing here.

306
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,190
It's brilliant, sir, that you pretended to be a useless nobody...

307
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,070
...but you can drop the act with me. It's cool.

308
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,780
Oh, the act.

309
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,450
Jump on. Let's go!

310
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,370
- Hey, uh, I--   - Hang on, sir.

311
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,460
All units...

312
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,420
...cut him off on Elm, now!

313
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,800
Or whenever you can.

314
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,380
10-4, Bad Cop.

315
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,920
- Watch out!   - Hold on.

316
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,390
We need to meet up with Vitruvius...

317
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,310
...and tell him the Piece has been found.

318
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,720
They're up on the monorail.

319
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,430
Release the copper choppers.

320
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,440
Oh, no!

321
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,410
Will you please tell me what is happening?

322
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,120
I'm rescuing you, sir. You're the one the prophecy spoke of.

323
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,200
You're The Special.

324
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,370
Me?

325
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,500
You found the Piece of Resistance.

326
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,040
And the prophecy states...

327
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,460
...that you are the most important, most talented...

328
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,840
...most interesting...

329
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:10,090
...and most extraordinary person in the universe.

330
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,130
That's you. Right?

331
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,510
Uh, yes. That's me.

332
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,720
Great. You drive.

333
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:18,470
What?

334
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:28,860
I wanna go home!

335
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,700
This is not what I meant!

336
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:41,500
Oh, no.

337
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,540
Look out, Special!

338
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,380
Uh, sorry. Never driven a motorcycle. Sorry!

339
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,760
Wow, he's amazing.

340
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,350
That was incredible!

341
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,850
You're even better than the prophecy said you'd be.

342
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,270
Oh. Really?

343
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,140
I'm, uh-- I'm Wyldstyle.

344
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,150
- Oh, I'm sorry, what was it?   - Wyldstyle.

345
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,480
- "Wyldstyle"?   - Yep.

346
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:07,770
- What are you, a DJ?   - No.

347
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,070
- Oh, that's your name? "Wyldstyle"?   - Yeah.

348
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,860
Like on your birth certificate, it says "Wyldstyle."

349
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:12,780
Let's not talk about my name!

350
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,410
Don't let The Special get away.

351
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,660
Sir, we've blocked the freeway.

352
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,120
Hang on, sir!

353
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:18,990
What are you doing?

354
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:21,830
Let's fly!

355
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,620
Head for the secret tunnel.

356
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,170
Uh, these are the city limits.

357
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,290
Let's just head for the tunnel.

358
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,300
You want me to drive into that weird swirly hole?

359
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,130
Are you insane?

360
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,090
Don't brake! Go! Don't stop! Go! Now!

361
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,180
I can't do this!

362
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,850
That is against the instructions!

363
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,720
Wait, what's your favorite restaurant?

364
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:41,770
Any chain restaurant.

365
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,520
Favorite TV show?

366
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,270
Where Are My Pants?

367
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,020
Favorite song?

368
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,310
Everything ls Awesome

369
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,560
Oh, no!

370
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,320
Wait. Where are we?

371
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,410
This is so weir--!

372
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,700
You're not The Special! You lied to me!

373
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,580
It really kind of depends on--

374
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,460
You're not even a MasterBuilder, are you?

375
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,790
Uh, I mean, I know what a MasterBuilder is.

376
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,010
Why don't you tell me what it is? That way I could see if you're right.

377
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,510
You've ruined the prophecy.

378
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:01,010
Look, I'm sorry, okay? You just--

379
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,470
You made being special sound so good.

380
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,480
And to think I was going to follow you to the end of the universe.

381
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,520
You were?

382
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:09,980
Here's the thing.

383
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,730
How do we know for sure that I'm not The Special?

384
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,440
- We just don't know it yet.   - Quiet.

385
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,280
Y'all want a giant turkey leg?

386
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,490
Do you have any idea what that does to your colon?

387
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,870
- Oh, my G-O-S-H.   - Just put the hat on.

388
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,660
...and this. And this. And this.

389
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,460
And this.

390
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,330
And, by the way, I have a boyfriend.

391
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,670
Uh, I'm not sure exactly why you'd bring that up.

392
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,840
It's super serious.

393
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,500
You do not want to mess with him.

394
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,260
Okay

395
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,670
So don't get any ideas.

396
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,590
I never have any ideas.

397
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,260
Wait!

398
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,550
- Stick them up.   - Hands where I can see them.

399
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,770
Hey, uh, listen. You think you can explain why I'm dressed like this...

400
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,480
...and what those big words in the sky were all about?

401
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,190
And, like, where we are in time.

402
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:56,480
Your home, Bricksburg, is one of many realms in the universe.

403
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,650
There's also this one...

404
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,240
...Pirate's Cove, Knight's Club, Viking's Landing, Clown Town...

405
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,700
...a bunch of others we don't need to mention.

406
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,490
Lord Business, or as you think you know him...

407
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,870
...President Business...

408
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,950
...stole the Kragle, the most powerful object in the universe.

409
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,870
Blah, blah, blah.

410
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,920
Proper name. Place name. Backstory stuff.

411
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,380
...Piece of Resistance is The Special.

412
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,010
I'm so pretty. I like you.

413
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,550
But I'm angry with you for some reason.

414
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,050
...tower at the end of the universe...

415
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,010
...put the Piece of Resistance onto the Kragle...

416
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,890
...and disarm it forever.

417
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,100
Great.

418
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,390
I think I got it...

419
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,680
...but just in case...

420
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,480
...tell me the whole thing again. I wasn't listening.

421
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:38,070
Okay. All the people of the universe were once free to travel...

422
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,280
...and mingle and build whatever they wanted.

423
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,660
But President Business was confused by all the chaos.

424
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,490
So he erected walls between the worlds...

425
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,410
...and became obsessed with order and perfection.

426
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,040
And he stole the mysterious...

427
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,120
...secret super weapon called-- The Kragle!

428
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:54,540
and he hired Bad Cop...

429
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:57,340
...to hunt down all the MasterBuilders, who were always changing everything.

430
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,670
And those of us who remained...

431
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,550
...well, we went into hiding. Built the tunnels to survive.

432
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,470
And we search for the Piece of Resistance.

433
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,310
The only thing that can stop the Kragle.

434
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,720
Kragle. I know that.

435
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,020
It might have been that cop. He said something about the Kragle.

436
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,440
President Business was going to use the Kragle...

437
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,940
...to end the world in three days.

438
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,230
I can't make any sense of it.

439
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,570
Taco Tuesday.

440
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,980
I knew that was suspicious. There's no time to lose.

441
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:24,200
We must find Vitruvius and get to the Office Tower before it's too late.

442
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,450
Okay

443
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,820
Heh. How scary can someone's office be?

444
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,340
President Business, we're trying to locate the fugitive...

445
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,880
...but his face is so generic it matches every other face in our database.

446
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,680
Diabolical.

447
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,890
Okay, have Bad Cop meet me in my office...

448
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,680
-...in 23 seconds. Ciao.   - Will do, sir.

449
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,720
Coffee sales are through the roof, sir.

450
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:54,270
Glad to hear it. Let's rebuild that roof to be even higher!

451
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,640
The roof team is on it.

452
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:58,110
Sir, can you approve this poster for Taco Tuesday?

453
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,400
Perfect.

454
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,400
- I love everyone in this room.   - We love you, sir!

455
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:04,070
- Great job on the radio station.   - Thank you, sir.

456
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,360
We love listening to this song over and over again.

457
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:07,410
Keep it up, GUYS-

458
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,660
Honey, where are my pants?

459
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,120
Cut!

460
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,000
Hilarious. That never gets old.

461
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,160
It does not.

462
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,750
Bad Cop is waiting for you in your office.

463
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,250
Wonderful. Fantastic.

464
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,290
Would you cancel my 2:00?

465
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,670
This next meeting could run a little bit...

466
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,920
...deadly.

467
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:33,890
Activate helmet.

468
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,480
Light sequence.

469
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,440
Flame test.

470
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,480
Engage dramatic entrance.

471
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:41,940
Bad Cop.

472
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,190
Lord Business. I know The Special got away, but--

473
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,190
Don't be so serious.

474
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:47,570
Where's the other guy?

475
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,660
- Hey, friend.   - Hey, buddy!

476
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,660
- I missed you.   - Aw, did you really?

477
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,410
Have I ever shown you my relic collection?

478
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,830
Nope. I don't think you have.

479
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,660
Nobody knows where this stuff comes from.

480
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:57,790
This one...

481
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,500
...is the Cloak of Ban Da'ld.

482
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,080
I hear it's super painful to take off.

483
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,880
- You wanna try it on?   - Well, um--

484
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,590
No, but thank you.

485
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,340
We've done some great work over the years together, Bad Cop...

486
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,470
...capturing all those MasterBuilders...

487
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,340
...and torturing them and whatnot.

488
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,300
Thank you, sir.

489
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,600
Although...

490
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,180
...you did let the Piece of Resistance go.

491
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,060
The one thing that can ruin my plans.

492
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,560
The one thing that I asked you to take care of.

493
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,860
That's super frustrating.

494
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,820
It makes me just wanna pick up whoever...

495
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,860
...is standing closest to me...

496
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,820
...and throw them through this window...

497
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:32,740
...and out into the infinite abyss of nothingness!

498
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,660
I wanna do it so bad.

499
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,960
I know you do, sir. Please don't.

500
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,500
And it's not just you, Bad Cop, that keeps messing up my plans.

501
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,380
People everywhere are always messing with my stuff.

502
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,470
But I have a way to fix that.

503
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,140
A way to keep things exactly the way they are supposed to be.

504
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,470
Permanently.

505
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,310
Behold...

506
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,480
...the most powerful weapon...

507
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,230
...of all the relics:

508
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,690
The Kragle!

509
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,160
As you can see, they're loading the Kragle in a big machine upstairs.

510
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,200
I call it...

511
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,950
...the Tentacle Arm Kragle Outside Sprayer.

512
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,500
Or TAKOS.

513
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,960
The "S" is silent.

514
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,540
So on Taco Tuesday...

515
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,960
...it's going to spray the Kragle over everyone and everything...

516
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:28,590
...with a bunch of super-scary nozzles like this one!

517
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,800
- I'll show you how it works.   - Sir, I don't know if this is necessary.

518
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:34,260
Oh, don't worry. I won't test it on you.

519
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:36,010
I'll do it on your parents!

520
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,180
What?

521
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,890
- Hi, son.   - Hi!

522
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,640
How's it going in the big city?

523
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:44,020
Mommy. Daddy. What are you doing here?

524
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,690
Okay, Pa. I just want you to act naturally.

525
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,980
- Like you're going about your day.   - Gotcha.

526
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,690
Yeah. Keep your hand up like that.

527
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,780
Ma, scoot...

528
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,700
...two steps in to the right.

529
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,870
Pa, whenever I talk to Ma...

530
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,240
-...you start to move.   - Sorry, sir.

531
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:58,660
Get back to where you were!

532
00:24:58,910 --> 00:24:59,620
- Here?   - Perfect.

533
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:02,250
That's great. You can't do anything better. No reason why you should move.

534
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,000
Right.

535
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:03,750
Now, Ma...

536
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,500
...hand on his shoulder. And you--

537
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,090
Pa, you just moved and you've just wrecked it!

538
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,000
You wrecked it!

539
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,420
Bad Cop, you see what I'm talking about?

540
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:15,430
All I'm asking for is total perfection.

541
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,100
Send in a Micro-manager!

542
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,390
Commencing micro-management.

543
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:25,560
Hold still, you guys.

544
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:29,570
And then...

545
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,070
...I just spray them...

546
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,530
...With the TAKOS.

547
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,450
Oh, Pa, hold me.

548
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,780
Oh, darling, I can't move me legs.

549
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,040
Does that upset you, Bad Cop?

550
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,540
Surely you feel bad for your parents, and you wanna help them, don't you?

551
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:48,590
We're okay, son. Just a little stuck, is all.

552
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,420
Go ahead...

553
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,670
...finish the job.

554
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,220
Of course, sir.

555
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,550
No, I don't want to.

556
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,300
- You have to.   - I don't want to.

557
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,060
- Would you please be quiet?   - I can't.

558
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,430
- You must. Shut it!    - But they--

559
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,640
-It's not nice.   -It's your job, man.

560
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,020
I can't do it.

561
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,850
- They're innocent.   - Just as I thought.

562
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,860
Your Good Cop side's making you soft, Bad Cop.

563
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:10,770
Robots!

564
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,400
Bring me the fleece-crested Scepter of Q-Teep...

565
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,570
...and the Pé-Lish Remover of Na-ll.

566
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,070
You've already let The Special get away once.

567
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:18,910
Sir.

568
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,200
I'm just gonna make sure it doesn't happen again.

569
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:23,620
No more Mr. Nice Guy!

570
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,880
Oh, son!

571
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,840
On Taco Tuesday, I'm going to Kragleize the entire universe...

572
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:37,130
...so that everyone will stop messing with my stuff!

573
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,010
Are you gonna be with me...

574
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,720
...or are you gonna be stuck...

575
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,890
...having a tea party with your mom and dad?

576
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:44,930
Son?

577
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,270
Sorry, Dad.

578
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,310
I have a job to do.

579
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,290
All you have to do is blend in and act like you belong here.

580
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,540
Ah, perfect.

581
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:14,170
Well, hi there, I'm a cowboy!

582
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,510
Bang, bang, bang-bang-bang-bang!

583
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,630
Shoot, shoot, shoot. Bullet, bullet, gun.

584
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,930
Zap, zap, zap, pow. Zap, pow.

585
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,260
- What are they looking at?   - I made a mistake.

586
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,930
You should just be still. Act like a stool.

587
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,350
- Wait!   - Howdy, guys!

588
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,520
- Quiet. Nope, stools don't talk.   - Come sit on me.

589
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,020
Okay, shh.

590
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,770
Let me show you how it's done.

591
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,070
What a lady!

592
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,160
Okay, let me just find the wizard...

593
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,200
...and get this over with.

594
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,670
There he is.

595
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,710
- Vitruvius.   - Who?

596
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,460
I've never heard of that man, whom I am not.

597
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,340
- Who are you?   -It's me.

598
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:00,180
I am a blind man and cannot see.

599
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,430
It's Wyldstyle.

600
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,640
Are you a DJ?

601
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,680
- What? Why does everybody--?   - Oh, wait, wait.

602
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,310
Are you the student I used to have...

603
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,270
...who was so insecure she kept changing her name?

604
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,100
No, no, no.

605
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,730
- First Darkstorm, then Geminizzle.   - No. Never.

606
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,900
Then Neversmile, then Freakface, then Snazzypants.

607
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,060
Okay. All right, yes.

608
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,190
Meet me upstairs in 10 seconds.

609
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,790
Oh, man.

610
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,080
You have a very weirdly...

611
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:30,960
-...decorated place.   - Thank you.

612
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:34,380
Vitruvius, we have found the Piece of Resistance.

613
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,210
- Is it true?   - Yes, but--

614
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,590
Wyldstyle. The prophecy states that...

615
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,510
...you are The Special.

616
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,130
The embodiment of good, foiler of evil.

617
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,300
The most talented, most brilliant...

618
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:48,390
...most important person in the universe.

619
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,590
That would be great...

620
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,310
...but Emmet is the one who found the Piece.

621
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,400
Oh, okay. Emmet!

622
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,860
The prophecy states that...

623
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,730
...you are The Special.

624
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,440
- The most talented--   - I'm not sure he's The Special.

625
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:03,200
Because he's not even a MasterBuilder. Watch.

626
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,950
Emmet, just given what's around you...

627
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,120
-...build something simple.   - Okay.

628
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,280
- Like an awesome race car.   - Great.

629
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:09,040
- Go.    - Do you have the instructions?

630
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:12,710
No. You must create the instructions in your mind, my liege.

631
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,290
Ah. Okay. Race car.

632
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:19,300
Well, there's a lot of really cool stuff here.

633
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,420
Don't see a wheel...

634
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,340
...Or...

635
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,970
...three more wheels.

636
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,930
See? He can't do it. He will never be a MasterBuilder.

637
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,480
Of course not. Not if you keep telling him he can't.

638
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:37,230
He needs to see that he can.

639
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,400
What are you doing?

640
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,440
- We are entering your mind...   - What?

641
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,740
...to prove that you have the unlocked potential...

642
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,400
...to be a MasterBuilder.

643
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,910
Whoa, are we inside my brain right now?

644
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,830
It's big. I must be smart.

645
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,750
I'm not hearing a lot of activity here.

646
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,510
I don't think he's ever had an original thought. In his life.

647
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,720
Ha, ha. That's not true.

648
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,800
For instance, one time I wanted to have...

649
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:08,010
...a bunch of my friends over to watch TV--

650
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:11,680
Not unlike this TV that just showed up magically.

651
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:13,770
And not everybody can fit on my one couch...

652
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,060
...and I thought to myself:

653
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:17,060
"What if there was such a thing as a bunk bed...

654
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,440
...but as a couch?"

655
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,980
Introducing the double-decker couch.

656
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:24,070
So everyone could watch TV together and be buddies!

657
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,950
That is literally the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

658
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,530
Please, Wyldstyle, let me handle this.

659
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:32,620
That idea is just the worst.

660
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,580
There must be something around here...

661
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,000
...that proves his potential.

662
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,670
If The Man Upstairs chose him to be The Special...

663
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,040
...there must be a reason.

664
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,540
- Who's The Man Upstairs?   - See?

665
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,300
He doesn't even know about The Man Upstairs.

666
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,920
Does he have, like, super-gross hands...

667
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:47,130
...that look like they're made out of big pink sausages?

668
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,390
Like eagle talons mixed with squid?

669
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,180
Wait. You've seen the--?

670
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,730
That's what I was just thinking about.

671
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:56,640
How did you--?

672
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,020
I had this weird dream when I touched the Piece.

673
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,270
Well, I mean, I wasn't asleep, so it wasn't really a dream.

674
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,570
Emmet, you had a vision.

675
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,610
I did?

676
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,320
MasterBuilders spend years...

677
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:07,360
...training themselves to clear their minds enough...

678
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:10,870
...to have even a fleeting glimpse of The Man Upstairs...

679
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,790
...and yet, your mind is already so prodigiously empty...

680
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,040
...that there is nothing in it to clear away in the first place.

681
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,370
With proper training...

682
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,040
...you could become a great MasterBuilder.

683
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,210
I could?

684
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,710
The prophecy chose you, Emmet.

685
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,920
But I can't do any of the stuff...

686
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:29,930
...that the prophecy says I'm supposed to do.

687
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:33,760
All you have to do is to believe.

688
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:34,680
Then...

689
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,600
...you will see everything.

690
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,850
Are you ready, my son?

691
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,650
Yes, I am.

692
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,730
I think.

693
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,780
Then we haven't a moment to lose.

694
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,490
We must assemble...

695
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,490
...the MasterBuilders.

696
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,160
Do you think Zeppelins are a bad investment?

697
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:09,840
Any of you fellas seen this guy?

698
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,800
Wait a minute, partner.

699
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,720
Draw a cowboy hat on him.

700
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,360
These mechanical birds will get our message out.

701
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,110
They will go to an Internet cafe...

702
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,860
...and e-mail the remaining MasterBuilders...

703
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:31,150
...who will meet us in the secret realm of Cloud Cuckooland.

704
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,990
Cuckooland? Wait. What happened to that whole training part?

705
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,830
Don't worry, Emmet.

706
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,740
Your training begins now.

707
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,040
Piano man...

708
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,040
open up-

709
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,750
Your training begins later!

710
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,960
On three.

711
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:46,960
One--

712
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,390
- Whew. I think we're in the clear.   - Freeze, turkeys.

713
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,350
All I want is the Piece of Resistance.

714
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,680
We would rather he died than give it to you.

715
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:04,230
I would not rather he died.

716
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,400
Look, everybody, we can do this the easy way, or we can do it--

717
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:08,320
Go, run!

718
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,940
They took the hard way. Fire!

719
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,190
Fire!

720
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,160
Vitruvius, which way to Cloud Cuckooland?

721
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,200
Head for the big bright thing in the sky.

722
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:18,280
- You mean the sun?   - Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

723
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,700
Let's get out of here. Here, use this.

724
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:20,870
What? Wait, hey--

725
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,830
- What are you doing? Aah!   - Let's go!

726
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:26,040
I don't know what I'm doing.

727
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,300
Good bye.

728
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,670
Boom!

729
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,260
Oh, dang!

730
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,350
Aah! I've got pigs! I hate pigs!

731
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,270
Quit playing around in the mud. I could use your help.

732
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,400
Wyldstyle, we could really use...

733
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:50,230
...your help!

734
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,510
Vitruvius, they're gaining on us. Build something!

735
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,720
Let Emmet try!

736
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:16,510
No, let's not let Emmet try! I haven't had any training.

737
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,340
That's okay.

738
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,600
We'll start with how to become a MasterBuilder.

739
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:22,390
Step one: Trust your instincts.

740
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,430
Okay, okay. Um--

741
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,100
Build something! Build something!

742
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:26,520
Aha. Take that!

743
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,570
Unless your instincts are terrible.

744
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:40,740
No! The wheel!

745
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,290
I can't control it much longer!

746
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:51,630
Emmet, we need to attach the wheel to something that spins around.

747
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,710
We need to attach the wheel to something that spins around.

748
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,760
We need to attach the wheel to something that spins around.

749
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:59,510
We need to attach the wheel to something that spins around.

750
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,600
Something that spins around. Spins around. Spins around.

751
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,310
Oh.

752
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,640
Emmet, where are you going?

753
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,270
Oh, this better work.

754
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,820
Hang tight!

755
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,530
Dagnabit!

756
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:19,700
Well done, Emmet.

757
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:21,660
Hey! I did it.

758
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,990
Wow. You actually did it.

759
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,210
Train!

760
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,050
Oh, no.

761
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,840
Get off my train.

762
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:39,050
Run!

763
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,220
Wyldstyle!

764
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,690
Owie!

765
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,060
He's gonna ram us.

766
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,360
Quick, quick, quick! That piece! Give me that piece.

767
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,860
Huh?

768
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,610
Build a ramp!

769
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:03,910
What the heck?

770
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,740
Rest in pieces.

771
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:08,660
Oh, no.

772
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:09,870
Wait. No, no, no.

773
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,260
Hey

774
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,550
Thanks for saving my life back there.

775
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,180
Even if, you know...

776
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:26,560
...eventually it turned out to be pointless.

777
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,520
Well, for what it's worth...

778
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,850
...this has been about the greatest 15 minutes of my life.

779
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,360
What the--?

780
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,240
Relax, everybody, I'm here.

781
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:46,120
Batman!

782
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,490
- What's up, babe?   - Babe!

783
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,540
- What?   - Oh, sorry. Batman, this is Emmet.

784
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,870
Emmet, this is my boyfriend, Batman.

785
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,580
I'm Batman.

786
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:56,540
That's your boyfriend?

787
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,210
Batman, huh? Where'd you guys meet?

788
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,840
It's actually a funny story, right, Bat?

789
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,050
There he is.

790
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,390
-"Police" to meet you, Bad Cop.   - Batman!

791
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,310
The pleasure...

792
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,350
...is all "spine."

793
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,640
Guess what...

794
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:10,730
...you big dumb baby.

795
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,310
Your car is a baby carriage.

796
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:16,230
Oh, no, your boyfriend's gone.

797
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,520
- Hey, babe.   - What?

798
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:18,770
Let's hold hands.

799
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,070
So, uh...

800
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,570
Hey, guys, I think we're about to crash into the sun.

801
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,910
Yeah, but it's gonna look really cool.

802
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,630
Uh, is this Cloud Cuckooland? I don't see any clouds.

803
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,590
- Or cuckoos.   - No, no, this is...

804
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,630
...Middle Zealand.

805
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,170
A wondrous land...

806
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,840
...full of knights, castles, mutton...

807
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:45,340
...torture weapons, poverty, leeches, illiteracy...

808
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,970
...and, um...

809
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,260
Dragon!

810
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,100
Yeah, that too.

811
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:56,350
Once we arrive at Cloud Cuckooland, we'll raise an army...

812
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,270
...of MasterBuilders to--

813
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,650
Anyway, you guys gotta check out these new subwoofers I installed.

814
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,900
I call them the dogs. Listen to them bark!

815
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,820
Can you turn that down a little bit?

816
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:08,660
This is a song I wrote for Wyldstyle.

817
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,280
Darkness

818
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:11,950
It's about how I'm an orphan.

819
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,700
No parents

820
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,460
This is real music, Emmet.

821
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,330
Batman's a true artist. Dark, brooding.

822
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,540
Well, I'm dark and brooding too.

823
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,670
Guys, look, a rainbow.

824
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,470
So you're gonna drive up the curved part...

825
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,420
Super rich

826
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,550
...take it all the way to the top...

827
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:28,590
Kind of makes it better

828
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,100
...and park the car.

829
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:34,140
Friends, welcome to Cloud Cuckooland. Now...

830
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,810
I just need to give the secret knock.

831
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,870
Okay

832
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,040
I'm just gonna come right out.

833
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:04,090
I have no idea what's going on, or what this place is at all.

834
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:07,550
Hi! I am Princess Unikitty...

835
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,050
...and I welcome you all to Cloud Cuckooland.

836
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:15,600
There's no signs or anything.

837
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:17,770
How does anyone know what not to do?

838
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,230
Here in Cloud Cuckooland...

839
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,560
...there are no rules.

840
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,190
There's no government...

841
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,770
...no babysitters...

842
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,190
...no bedtimes...

843
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,990
...no frowny faces...

844
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,070
...no bushy mustaches...

845
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,530
...and no negativity of any kind.

846
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,660
You just said the word "no" like a thousand times.

847
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:36,160
And there's also no consistency.

848
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,210
I hate this place.

849
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,330
Any idea is a good idea...

850
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,210
...except the not happy ones.

851
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,340
Those you push down deep inside...

852
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,800
...where you'll never, ever, ever...

853
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:47,630
...ever...

854
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,590
...find them.

855
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,220
Your fellow MasterBuilders are gathered in the Dog.

856
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:53,600
The what?

857
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,890
Ah! Is that Superman?

858
00:39:59,230 --> 00:39:59,890
Girl, what are you doing?

859
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,980
- Hey, Superman!   - Oh, hey. What's up?

860
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:04,070
- Lantern. Green Lantern.   - Yeah, yeah.

861
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,820
You wanna sit together at the meeting?

862
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,610
Um, I have to go back to Krypton.

863
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,900
Didn't Krypton blow up?

864
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:13,320
My fellow MasterBuilders, including but not limited to...

865
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:14,580
...Robin Hood, Mermaid Lady...

866
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:15,330
...Gandalf...

867
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,080
...Swamp Creature...

868
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,080
-...1980-something Space Guy...   - Hello!

869
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:20,160
...2002 NBA All-Stars...

870
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:22,000
and Wonder Woman.

871
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:25,540
You have traveled far to be here for a moment of great import.

872
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,710
We have learned...

873
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,880
...that Lord Business plans to unleash...

874
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,720
...a fully weaponized Kragle...

875
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,430
...on Taco Tuesday...

876
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,050
...to end the world as we know it.

877
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,430
Please, calm yourselves.

878
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,180
Green Ninja...

879
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:38,930
...Milhouse...

880
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:39,890
...Nice Vampire...

881
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,390
...Michelangelo, Michelangelo...

882
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,650
...and Cleopatra.

883
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,610
There is yet one hope.

884
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,730
The Special has arisen.

885
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:50,240
Have the young man step forward.

886
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:51,490
As you wish, Dubbledore.

887
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,450
I'm Gandalf!

888
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,740
-It's pronounced "Dumbledore."   - Dubbadore?

889
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:56,240
No, "Dumbledore."

890
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:57,200
Thought you said "Dubbadore."

891
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:58,040
Vitruvius!

892
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,500
You gotta write that down. I'm not gonna remember any of it.

893
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:01,960
But here we go.

894
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:07,170
The Special will now give an eloquent speech.

895
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,050
Go ahead, man. You got this.

896
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,850
Okay

897
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:24,520
Hello. I'm Emmet.

898
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,900
Oh, and this is the Piece of Resistance.

899
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,580
Thank you.

900
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,910
Well, uh, I know that I, for one...

901
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,410
...am very excited to work with you guys...

902
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,580
...to get into the Octan Tower, find the Kragle...

903
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:47,840
...and put this thing on the thing.

904
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:50,590
And I know it's going to be really hard, but--

905
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,090
"Really hard"?

906
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:56,800
Wiping ye burn with a hook for a hand is really hard.

907
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:58,720
This be impossible.

908
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:01,810
The last time we tried to storm Lord Business' office...

909
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,230
...we used every plan we could conceive.

910
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,730
The result was a massacre too terrible to speak of.

911
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:09,110
Who are you?

912
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,440
The name be Metal Beard.

913
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:14,200
And I'll tell you me tale of woe.

914
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:16,070
Oh, great, here we go again.

915
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:16,950
I arrived...

916
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,370
...at the foot of the Tower...

917
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,290
...with me hearty MasterBuilder crew...

918
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:25,540
...only to find the Kragle was all the way up on the infinityeth floor...

919
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:28,130
guarded by a robot army...

920
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,340
...and security measures...

921
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:30,790
...of every kind...

922
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:32,170
...imaginable:

923
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,460
Lasers...

924
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,550
...sharks...

925
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,760
...laser sharks...

926
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:39,510
...overbearing assistants...

927
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,850
...and strange, dangerous relics...

928
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:43,890
...that entrap...

929
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:44,730
II-Snap...

930
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:45,940
...and zap.

931
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:50,110
And there be a mysterious room called the Think Tank.

932
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,570
I barely made it out of that...

933
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,440
...room...

934
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:54,570
...with just me head!

935
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:58,740
And organs.

936
00:42:58,990 --> 00:42:59,660
Okay

937
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,660
I had to replace every part of my once-strapping...

938
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:04,330
...virile pirate body...

939
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:08,120
...with this useless hunk of garbage ye see before ye.

940
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:12,000
So if ye think it'd be a good idea to return...

941
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:13,300
...to that forsaken place...

942
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:14,630
...Special...

943
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,920
...what idea have ye that be better...

944
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:18,720
...than the ideas of 100...

945
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:21,430
...of our fallen MasterBuilder brothers?

946
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:23,310
Well, uh...

947
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,430
Well, technically I'm not exactly a MasterBuilder yet.

948
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,600
What?

949
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:31,610
Please! Everyone! Please!

950
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:33,270
Rubbish!

951
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,150
Yes, it's true.

952
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,070
I may not be a MasterBuilder.

953
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,240
I may not have a lot of experience...

954
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:43,620
...fighting or leading or coming up with plans.

955
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,160
Or having ideas in general.

956
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,960
In fact, I'm not all that smart.

957
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:53,840
And I'm not what you'd call a "creative type."

958
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,550
Plus...

959
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,880
...generally unskilled.

960
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,930
Also...

961
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,850
...scared and cowardly.

962
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:05,390
I know what you're thinking:

963
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:08,020
"He is the least qualified person...

964
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,480
...in the world to lead us."

965
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,900
And you are right.

966
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:16,110
This is supposed to make us feel better?

967
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,530
No, there was about to be a "but."

968
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,610
- You're a butt!   - Yes.

969
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:23,070
You all be on your own!

970
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,830
I be leaving this lost cause!

971
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,080
Why are you leaving?

972
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:32,250
A house divided against itself would be better...

973
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,580
...than this.

974
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:35,130
Abraham Lincoln!

975
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,300
You bring your space chair right back here!

976
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,170
Come on, guys!

977
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:42,130
We can still do this. Right?

978
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,010
You're not even a bit special.

979
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:46,810
Well, you were right about him being a ding-dong.

980
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,640
You're a huge disappointment.

981
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:52,100
Get him out of here. I don't wanna look at him.

982
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:57,900
Well, at least it can't get any worse.

983
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:01,280
I was wrong.

984
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:06,280
It's the Orb of Tee-ti-list!

985
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:09,290
Ruh-roh. It's the bad guys.

986
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,330
Whoa. How did he--?

987
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:14,290
Go! Run! Come on, everyone! Protect The Special.

988
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:15,920
What's that on his ankle?

989
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:18,710
It's a tracking device.

990
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,920
Take the MasterBuilders prisoner.

991
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:22,670
Oh, he led them right to us.

992
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:25,090
Guys, no, no, no. It's not my fault.

993
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:28,430
You are the worst leader I've ever seen. To the Batmobile!

994
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:30,930
Dang it.

995
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:32,180
To the invisible jet!

996
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,980
- Dang it!   - Every man for himself.

997
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:38,020
No, we must protect the Piece.

998
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:39,650
Shaq, do you know what time...

999
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,780
-...it is?   -It's game time.

1000
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,660
Y'all ready for this?

1001
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,370
Oh, no! They were ready for that.

1002
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:51,250
It didn't break!

1003
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,250
Because it's Kragled. Machine gum!

1004
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:55,710
Fire!

1005
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:56,790
No!

1006
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,630
Aah! I can't move!

1007
00:45:58,880 --> 00:45:59,590
Don't worry, Superman.

1008
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,340
- I'll get you out of there.   - No! Don't!

1009
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:05,510
Aah! Oh, my gosh. My hands are stuck. My legs are stuck as well.

1010
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,760
I super hate you.

1011
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:10,350
- Ow! You're pulling my torso off.   - Babe...

1012
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,470
...help me get him out of here.

1013
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,980
I said "every man for himself."

1014
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,850
Hey, you gotta be there for me.

1015
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:19,770
Fine!

1016
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:21,530
Fine. Fine. Fine.

1017
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,650
- I need you to have a better attitude.   - I have a great...

1018
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,530
-...attitude.   - Ouch.

1019
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:27,410
The Special's in the northwest quadrant.

1020
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,910
We've got him cornered.

1021
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:30,700
Ouch. Ouch. Ouch.

1022
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:31,870
Where'd he go?

1023
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:37,500
Oh, no!

1024
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:39,500
They've hit our silly cloud stabilizers!

1025
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:41,590
Let's go! We need to get Emmet out of here.

1026
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,840
- Can't we build something?   - Hey! I'm Ben. But you can call me Benny.

1027
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:46,090
I can build a spaceship. Watch.

1028
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:48,720
Spaceship, spaceship, spaceship Spaceship, spaceship

1029
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:50,850
No! You can't. The skies are surrounded.

1030
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,140
That's okay. I didn't really wanna build...

1031
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:54,640
...a spaceship anyway. That's cool.

1032
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:56,390
Where can we go where we can't be found?

1033
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,150
Maybe we could go underwater?

1034
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,020
What if we went underwater?

1035
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:00,980
Great idea, babe!

1036
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:02,900
Thank you, Batman. Your ideas are the best.

1037
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:03,860
But I just said that.

1038
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:07,070
- We could build a submarine.   - A Bat-Submarine, patent pending.

1039
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,070
With rainbows!

1040
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,200
And dream catchers, in case we take a nap.

1041
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:11,780
Like an underwater spaceship!

1042
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:13,410
But you can't build all of them at once.

1043
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,080
Ready? Break.

1044
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:15,950
Okay

1045
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:19,290
Blue razzleberry and sour apple!

1046
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,380
If anybody has black parts, I need them, okay?

1047
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:22,750
I only work in black.

1048
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,010
And sometimes, very, very dark gray.

1049
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,420
- Use the yellow bricks!   - Hey, guys, can I help?

1050
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:28,680
- No! It has to be this way!   - No, I need that!

1051
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:29,640
Where is he?

1052
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:32,050
Anyone know what this is, and do you need it?

1053
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:33,970
I think we could use wings and rocket boosters.

1054
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:35,720
Ew. Get your retro space stuff out of my area.

1055
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:38,940
You guys, hey, just tell me exactly what to do. And how to do it.

1056
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:42,360
Emmet, don't worry about what the others are doing.

1057
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:46,490
You must embrace what is special about you!

1058
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:55,870
There he is!

1059
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,080
All units, attack the sub!

1060
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:03,880
Emmet, get in here!

1061
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:11,550
Stop him! Stop him! Don't let him...

1062
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:12,760
...get to the water!

1063
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:14,050
Dive, dive, dive! Everybody in!

1064
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,140
We're going under!

1065
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:34,240
Oh, no.

1066
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:55,800
My home.

1067
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,470
It's gone.

1068
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:05,560
I feel something inside.

1069
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:07,820
It's like the opposite of happiness.

1070
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,570
I must stay positive.

1071
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:15,370
Ah. Bubble gums.

1072
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:18,160
Butterflies.

1073
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,960
Cotton candy.

1074
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:27,880
Gosh, I'm so sorry, Unikitty.

1075
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,130
Do you want to sit down and talk about it?

1076
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:36,510
What the heck is that?

1077
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,510
It's a double-decker couch.

1078
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,270
Which seemed like a good idea at the time...

1079
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,850
...but I now realize it's not super helpful.

1080
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:46,650
But, you know, it has cup holders.

1081
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,440
Seats flip up with coolers underneath.

1082
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:53,570
You are so disappointing on so many levels.

1083
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:56,570
Why are my pants cold and wet?

1084
00:49:59,240 --> 00:49:59,830
Hull breach.

1085
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,160
The walls are crying!

1086
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:03,500
We're coming apart at the seams!

1087
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:06,210
This is not how Batman dies.

1088
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:08,420
Emmet!

1089
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:10,500
- Hold on, hold on!   - Wyldstyle!

1090
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:14,420
Deep breath! Deep breath, everybod--!

1091
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:35,320
Micro-managers, what's going on down there?

1092
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:38,160
Scanning submarine wreckage.

1093
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,330
No survivors detected.

1094
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,580
Scuba cops, dredge the entire ocean if you have to.

1095
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:46,750
We have got to find that Piece.

1096
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,960
Let's get these prisoners back to Lord Business...

1097
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:50,460
...and give him the good news.

1098
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:53,420
The Special is no more.

1099
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,090
Hello, everybody!

1100
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:02,220
Superman. Wonder Woman, I had no idea you'd be here.

1101
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:03,770
Mr. Shaquille O'Neal.

1102
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,850
Greetings, all!

1103
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:08,350
Welcome to my Think Tank.

1104
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:10,690
Help us!

1105
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,900
All the MasterBuilders you've captured over the years...

1106
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:14,030
...you've brought them here.

1107
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,820
You're a very perceptive person, Superman.

1108
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:20,370
They come up with all the instructions for everything in the universe.

1109
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:21,620
Robots!

1110
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:24,160
No! No!

1111
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,960
Can't get much worse than this.

1112
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:32,380
- Uh, hello, neighbor.   - Oh, no.

1113
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:33,550
It's Green Lantern.

1114
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,880
Oh, my gosh, we're roommates! How crazy is that?

1115
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:39,760
Does anyone have some Kryptonite that they could give me?

1116
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:43,350
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where is The Special?

1117
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,520
The Special and the Piece of Resistance are at the bottom of the ocean.

1118
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,520
Wait, are you telling me you don't have him?

1119
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:52,400
Sir, my scuba team is looking for his remains as we speak.

1120
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:56,610
Bad Cop, he could still be alive! The Piece could still be out there.

1121
00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:00,320
The only remnant of The Special was a double-decker couch.

1122
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:01,870
Wait, hold on.

1123
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,990
A double-decker couch?

1124
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:04,790
Yes, sir.

1125
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,960
Really? So it's like a bunk-bed couch? Is that what it's like?

1126
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:10,420
That's weird.

1127
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:12,170
If you're sitting in the top middle...

1128
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,250
...how are you gonna get down without climbing over someone?

1129
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,170
If you're sitting on the bottom and you're watching TV...

1130
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:20,050
...are you gonna have to watch through a bunch of dangling legs?

1131
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,050
Who's gonna want to sit on the bottom?

1132
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:23,550
It is literally...

1133
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:27,810
...the most useless idea I have ever heard.

1134
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:33,020
- Well, we're still alive.   - Yeah!

1135
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:35,440
Heh. The double-decker couch.

1136
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:37,400
It wasn't totally pointless after all.

1137
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:39,490
It's the one thing that stayed together.

1138
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,490
I always believed in you, Emmet.

1139
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:44,530
I don't mean to spoil the party, but does anyone else notice...

1140
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:46,990
...we're stuck in the middle of the ocean on this couch?

1141
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,120
I mean, it's not like a big gigantic ship...

1142
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:50,750
...is gonna come out of nowhere and save us--

1143
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,080
My gosh!

1144
00:52:56,290 --> 00:52:58,260
Avast, mateys!

1145
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:08,220
Metal Beard, I thought you said we were a lost cause!

1146
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:09,470
Ye are!

1147
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,600
Did ye not hear me whole story...

1148
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:15,060
...circumscribing the folly of this whole enterprise?

1149
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:17,650
Well, it's kind of hard not to hear when you're yelling everything.

1150
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,320
So why did you come back?

1151
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:21,950
This be-doubled land couch.

1152
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:26,870
I watched Lord Business' forces completely overlook it.

1153
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,240
Which means we need more ideas like it!

1154
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:30,160
Oh, thank you.

1155
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:32,330
Ideas so dumb and bad...

1156
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:36,460
...that no one would ever think they could possibly be useful.

1157
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:38,300
Oh. Thank you.

1158
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:41,090
So, Special, what do we do?

1159
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:46,180
Uh...

1160
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:48,430
Well...

1161
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:52,810
...what's the last thing Lord Business expects MasterBuilders will do?

1162
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:53,690
Build a spaceship?

1163
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:54,440
Kill a chicken?

1164
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:55,520
Marry a marshmallow.

1165
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:56,350
Why, this:

1166
00:53:56,610 --> 00:54:00,110
How you gonna keep 'em down on the farm?

1167
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,240
No! It's follow the instructions.

1168
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:05,820
- Don't like that.   - Sounds weird.

1169
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:07,990
Now, listen. Wait, listen.

1170
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:13,910
Guys, you're all so talented and imaginative.

1171
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:17,500
But you can't work together as a team.

1172
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,630
I'm just a construction worker.

1173
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,840
But when I had a plan and we were all working together...

1174
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:26,640
...I mean, we could build a skyscraper.

1175
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,470
Now, you're MasterBuilders.

1176
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:35,730
Just imagine what could happen if you did that.

1177
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:39,110
You could save the universe.

1178
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:42,280
Well said, Emmet. Well said.

1179
00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:43,530
Really?

1180
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,070
She be a fine speech there, laddie.

1181
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,700
Okay

1182
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:51,660
Somebody get me some markers...

1183
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,500
...some construction paper...

1184
00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:00,340
...and some glitter glue!

1185
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:04,090
I call this:

1186
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:06,420
"Emmet's plan to get inside the Tower...

1187
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,180
...put the Piece of Resistance on the Kragle...

1188
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:09,890
...and save the world."

1189
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,310
I've built a hundred just like them back in the city.

1190
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,270
If we can just get in, I know where the air ducts and wiring are located.

1191
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,430
I can get us anywhere.

1192
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:17,890
How will we get inside?

1193
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,730
In a spaceship.

1194
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:22,570
- Spaceship! Ha, ha!   - Great idea. A Bat-Spaceship.

1195
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,940
No, they're expecting us to show up...

1196
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:28,410
...in a Bat-Spaceship, or a pirate spaceship or a rainbow-sparkle spaceship.

1197
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:29,780
One of those sounds awesome to me.

1198
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:32,080
My idea is to build a spaceship...

1199
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:35,000
...that's exactly like all the other Octan delivery spaceships.

1200
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:38,420
So not the special spaceship that I'm building for all of you right now?

1201
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:40,040
Sorry, Benny. Maybe next time.

1202
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:43,170
Ooh, you're really letting the oxygen out of my tank here.

1203
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:46,460
Yeah, but according to your precious instructions...

1204
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,220
...this ship needs a hyperdrive.

1205
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:49,340
We don't have that part.

1206
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:50,430
Maybe we could find one!

1207
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,180
What do you think, a spaceship is just gonna appear out of the blue?

1208
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:54,510
Are you kidding me?

1209
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:55,850
The same thing!

1210
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:01,400
Chewie!

1211
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:04,020
We're supposed to be halfway to Naboo for a sweet party!

1212
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:05,940
This hyperdrive keeps malfunctioning...

1213
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:07,990
...taking us to loser systems like this.

1214
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,780
Captain Solo, we must go.

1215
00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:11,820
You know how perturbed I get if we are not punctual.

1216
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:13,450
The Droid's right. Let's roll.

1217
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,330
Now hold on, Han.

1218
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:18,000
This might be the right galaxy after all.

1219
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,540
Because I see a heavenly body.

1220
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:24,290
Ooh, whoa, I have a boyfriend. And it is super serious. Right, babe?

1221
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:25,880
- Of course it's serious.   - Yeah!

1222
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:28,050
- Got room for just one dude?   - Whoa! Babe!

1223
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:30,340
If he's a cool dude like you.

1224
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:31,680
You're trying to bail on us!

1225
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:32,550
I'm not trying to bail!

1226
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,550
You asked them if you could go with them on their party ship!

1227
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,100
That thing is filled with bon vivants.

1228
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:37,180
You speak French now?

1229
00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:40,560
Babe, look, if this relationship is ever gonna work between us...

1230
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:42,190
...I need to feel free to party...

1231
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,230
...with a bunch of strangers whenever I feel like it.

1232
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:44,980
What?

1233
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:45,940
Babe!

1234
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,990
I will text you.

1235
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:52,450
Where'd you get that sweet space cape, brother?

1236
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,700
It's party time!

1237
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:57,830
Babe?

1238
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:10,090
Wyldstyle, you're such an amazing person.

1239
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:14,340
And, you know, if Batman can't see that, then he's just--

1240
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:18,600
Well, he's just as blind as a guy...

1241
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:21,730
...whose eyes stopped working.

1242
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,520
And I'm gonna tell you something:

1243
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:27,110
Batman is the worst person I've ever met.

1244
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,110
- Need a hyperdrive?   - No way.

1245
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,990
- Babe!   - I knew it! I knew that.

1246
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,490
You really had me there!

1247
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,490
Those guys were so lame. All they did was play space checkers.

1248
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:37,530
Plus, it turns out the hairy one's a dude.

1249
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:39,330
And the metal one too. All dudes.

1250
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:41,540
But won't they notice their hyperdrive is missing?

1251
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:44,870
Come on, Chewie, hit the hyperdrive.

1252
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:49,000
Nah, they'll be fine.

1253
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:53,460
Step one:

1254
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:56,800
All right, we need a red four-piece unit over at the--

1255
00:57:57,050 --> 00:57:57,640
Unikitty...

1256
00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:00,970
you're supposed to follow the instructions, remember?

1257
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:01,850
Sorry.

1258
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:03,350
Ugh, this gives me the jeebies.

1259
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,150
What do I even--? I can't--!

1260
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:09,520
Nice!

1261
00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:11,040
Step two:

1262
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:12,490
We pilot the ship to the service entrance...

1263
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,650
...so we can get past the dangerous...

1264
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,280
...but also kind of cool...

1265
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:17,570
...laser gate.

1266
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:19,410
Space ID.

1267
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:20,580
I have a drive-on.

1268
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,040
Who are you here to see?

1269
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:23,710
I'm here to see Your Butt.

1270
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,330
Is that last name "Butt," first name "Your," or is it--?

1271
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:27,170
Oh, my gosh!

1272
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:38,300
First try!

1273
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:42,640
Step three." We break into Lord Business' office...

1274
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:45,310
...and we'll plunder his collection of relics for disguises.

1275
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:47,060
Step four:

1276
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:48,520
Benny and Metal Beard...

1277
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:50,060
will sneak their way into the master control room.

1278
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,400
Motion sensors triggered in Sector 12.

1279
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:53,280
10-4.

1280
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:01,200
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

1281
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:02,660
Do it.

1282
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:08,370
Metal Beard, that was awesome!

1283
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:10,340
First law of the sea...

1284
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:13,760
...never place your rear end on a pirate's face.

1285
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:16,130
Once inside, they'll use their technical know-how...

1286
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:17,630
...to disable the Kragle shield.

1287
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:18,840
I am the computer.

1288
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:21,260
Cool! Talking computer.

1289
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:24,680
Please disable the shield systems.

1290
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:26,060
Of course.

1291
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,690
There are no movies in your area with that title.

1292
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:31,060
Step five:

1293
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:33,360
Vitruvius will provide lookout and make sure we're not being followed.

1294
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:34,730
Okay.

1295
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:37,950
Step six: Batman and Unikitty go into the boardroom...

1296
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,450
...to make one last change to Lord Business' plan.

1297
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:43,450
I move that we freeze the universe. Can I get a second on that?

1298
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:44,370
I second.

1299
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:47,080
Bruce Wayne, CEO of Wayne Enterprises.

1300
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:49,920
Bruce Wayne? Uh, who's that?

1301
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:52,380
Sounds like a cool guy.

1302
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:55,590
We'd like to invest in your company.

1303
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:58,380
Your weapon to control the universe sounds super sweet...

1304
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,800
-...I must say.   - It is, indeed, super sweet.

1305
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:03,550
Cool. What kind of sound system does it have?

1306
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:06,600
Uh, sound system? Well, I mean, we have an iPod Shuffle.

1307
01:00:06,850 --> 01:00:07,770
Wait a second.

1308
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:09,890
You're telling me you have a machine to control the universe...

1309
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:12,110
...and you can't listen to tunes in surround sound?

1310
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,270
Embarrassing.

1311
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,480
Well, I mean...

1312
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:16,820
...we need to get that done. I want eight-foot speakers.

1313
01:00:17,070 --> 01:00:17,740
Great call.

1314
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:21,030
Yeah, I want speakers that you can hug with your arms and your legs...

1315
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,820
...and just feel the beat.

1316
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:27,410
Listen up! We need new instructions for a speaker system for the TAKOS.

1317
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:28,580
We'll never help.

1318
01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:29,830
Whatever you say, boss.

1319
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,460
Then once the instructions are printed...

1320
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:34,790
Wyldstyle and I will enter the Kragle room...

1321
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,800
...place the thing on the other thing...

1322
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,840
...and save the universe.

1323
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:41,590
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, I didn't draw that. Is that me exploding?

1324
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,340
Uh, I didn't mention that earlier?

1325
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:46,470
When you reunite the Piece with the Kragle, it might explode?

1326
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,520
No! But it might not, right?

1327
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,150
Sure, sure, sure. Let's go with that.

1328
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:55,020
Attention, everybody! Incoming speaker delivery!

1329
01:01:05,490 --> 01:01:06,410
Who are you two?

1330
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:08,870
We are transfers from downstairs.

1331
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,040
- What?   - Excuse me?

1332
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:13,040
Your robot voice sounds an awful lot like a human voice.

1333
01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:15,290
Give me a break. I've never been a robot before.

1334
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:17,590
What do you mean? You have always been a robot!

1335
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,710
No, no, no, do not listen to her.

1336
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:21,720
What are your robot serial numbers?

1337
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:29,930
Everything is awesome

1338
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:32,640
No way. This is my jam.

1339
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:34,480
This is also my jam.

1340
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:36,440
Everything is awesome

1341
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:38,820
Everything is cool When you're part of a team

1342
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:41,690
- Needs great harmonies.   - I don't want to sing the song. I'm not--

1343
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:44,240
Everything is awesome

1344
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:47,910
Everything is cool When you're part of a team

1345
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,500
Everything is awesome

1346
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:53,410
When we're living our dream

1347
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,040
Quick, let's go.

1348
01:01:55,290 --> 01:01:56,540
Everything is awesome

1349
01:01:56,790 --> 01:01:58,500
Hmm, I thought you didn't like that song.

1350
01:01:58,750 --> 01:01:59,710
I don't.

1351
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:01,420
Mm-hm.

1352
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,260
I know you put on this tough act...

1353
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:05,970
...but I don't think you're as mean as you're trying to seem.

1354
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:07,550
I'm not mean. What are you talking about?

1355
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,560
I'm just saying, you were all, "He's not The Special, Vitruvius.

1356
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:13,600
He can't possibly be The Special. This guy? Are you kidding me?"

1357
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:17,310
Anyways, I don't think that's you.

1358
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:19,230
The real you, anyway.

1359
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:29,120
Look, Emmet.

1360
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:32,450
I wanted it to be me, okay?

1361
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:35,250
I wanted to be The Special.

1362
01:02:35,870 --> 01:02:39,380
And I know that sounds super mature. It's just...

1363
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:43,130
...ever since I heard the prophecy, I wanted to be the One.

1364
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,630
I was right there in that construction site...

1365
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:49,300
...right on top of it, and then...

1366
01:02:50,890 --> 01:02:52,270
...it turned out to be you.

1367
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:02,070
That night in the city, when you thought I was The Special...

1368
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:08,410
...and you said I was talented and important...

1369
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:12,620
...that was the first time anyone had ever really told me that.

1370
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:15,460
And it made me wanna do everything I could...

1371
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:17,540
...to be the guy you were talking about.

1372
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:21,960
Lucy.

1373
01:03:22,210 --> 01:03:23,380
What?

1374
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,880
That was my real name.

1375
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:28,680
You asked earlier, and it's...

1376
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:31,050
...Lucy.

1377
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,060
I really like that name.

1378
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:40,770
Hey

1379
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:42,940
- What are you two losers talking about?   - Huh? What? Oh, nothing.

1380
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:45,940
Thought I'd help you guys. Left the weird cat thing to stall.

1381
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:48,240
Business, business, business. Numbers.

1382
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:50,160
- Is this working?   - Yes.

1383
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:51,160
Yay!

1384
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:52,700
There's Bad Cop.

1385
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:56,540
Oh, Danny boy, the pipes--

1386
01:03:56,790 --> 01:03:58,540
Okay. Wait for my signal.

1387
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:00,210
Good luck, Emmet.

1388
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:01,710
Lucy.

1389
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,670
I guess this might be goodbye.

1390
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:08,300
I don't like goodbyes. Let's just call this:

1391
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,640
"See you later, alligator."

1392
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:13,510
"See you later, alligator"?

1393
01:04:15,430 --> 01:04:17,520
After a while, crocodile.

1394
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:21,730
Who's Lucy?

1395
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:23,400
Batman, when we get inside this room...

1396
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:25,110
...there are gonna be audio sensors everywhere.

1397
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:27,240
We have to be really, really quiet.

1398
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:30,400
Don't worry, Dad, I read your dumb instructions. Stop yelling at me.

1399
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:31,950
Benny, what's our status with the shield?

1400
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,320
Oh, yeah, no, it's going great.

1401
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:35,950
It's just going great, if somebody would listen to me!

1402
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,330
Downloading latest episode of Where Are My Pants?

1403
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:41,080
Where are you getting "pants" from? You know what I want!

1404
01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:42,380
The pipes are calling--

1405
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:44,090
Bad Cop.

1406
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:46,130
Hi, this is Lord Business' assistant.

1407
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:48,300
He would like you to come to his office immediately.

1408
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:49,170
Copy that.

1409
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:51,260
- Thanks.   - You are welcome, sir.

1410
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:55,600
Hey, who is that?

1411
01:04:58,850 --> 01:04:59,850
That's the signal...

1412
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:02,020
...but the shield is still up.

1413
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:03,600
We'll wing it.

1414
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:06,610
That's a bat pun.

1415
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:09,860
Shh. Benny...

1416
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:11,570
...disable the shield.

1417
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:12,780
- Disable the shield.   - Now.

1418
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:14,160
Disable the shield.

1419
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:16,080
- Searching for Albanian restaurants.   - What?

1420
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:19,040
- No! I never once said anything--!   - I don't understand what you mean.

1421
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:20,660
Disable the shield!

1422
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:21,870
Benny, what's going on?

1423
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:23,580
Disable the shield! Come on!

1424
01:05:23,830 --> 01:05:25,290
You are undermining me!

1425
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:27,380
Which phrase would you like me to underline?

1426
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:28,670
Disable the shield!

1427
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:30,130
Let me try.

1428
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:34,470
Be ye disabling of yon shield.

1429
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:35,430
Disabling shield.

1430
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:36,300
What?

1431
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:42,810
Okay, in three...

1432
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:45,350
...two...

1433
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:47,980
...one.

1434
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,780
Let's do this.

1435
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:52,950
Lucy!

1436
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:56,780
Lucy!

1437
01:05:58,580 --> 01:05:59,580
No!

1438
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:02,460
Oh, man.

1439
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:03,910
Oh, no.

1440
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:05,080
Uh-oh.

1441
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:08,250
Sneaking around the corner...

1442
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:11,840
Vitruvius.

1443
01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:15,510
I see you've accidentally wandered into my Think Tank.

1444
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,930
And by the way, I found a few of your friends.

1445
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:21,060
- By which I mean all of them!   - Sorry!

1446
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:22,980
Acceptable work, Bad Cop.

1447
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:23,890
Thank you, sir.

1448
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:26,730
Robots, destroy this old man at once.

1449
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:28,270
Did you just call me "old"?

1450
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:29,730
Yeah. So what?

1451
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:33,530
Well, Junebug, I really prefer the word...

1452
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:34,780
..."experienced"!

1453
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:51,590
Aha.

1454
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:52,630
You see, Emmet?

1455
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,090
A corrupted spirit is no match for the purity of imagina--

1456
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:00,850
- Ha-ha-ha!   - Vitruvius!

1457
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:02,560
No!

1458
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:05,890
Vitruvius.

1459
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:10,060
My sweet Emmet. Come closer.

1460
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,650
You must know something about the prophecy.

1461
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:14,650
I know, I'm doing my best...

1462
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:15,610
...but I don't--

1463
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:17,280
The prophecy...

1464
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:19,030
I made it up.

1465
01:07:19,530 --> 01:07:20,570
What?

1466
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,790
I made it up. It's not true.

1467
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:26,290
But that means I'm just--

1468
01:07:26,790 --> 01:07:28,290
I'm not The Special?

1469
01:07:28,830 --> 01:07:29,790
You must listen.

1470
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,250
What I'm about to tell you...

1471
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:35,130
...will change the course of history.

1472
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:40,800
No.

1473
01:07:41,550 --> 01:07:42,640
No.

1474
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,400
Hey.

1475
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:54,320
Not so special anymore, huh?

1476
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:57,990
Well, guess what.

1477
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,530
No one ever told me I was special.

1478
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:04,120
I never got a trophy just for showing up!

1479
01:08:04,370 --> 01:08:07,540
I'm not some special little snowflake...

1480
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,130
But as unspecial as I am...

1481
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:14,420
...you are a thousand-billion times...

1482
01:08:14,670 --> 01:08:16,130
...more unspecial than me.

1483
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:19,470
Robots, bring me the Sword of Exact Zero.

1484
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,010
Yes, Lord Business.

1485
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,220
It must be weird.

1486
01:08:23,470 --> 01:08:27,180
One minute, you're the most special person in the universe.

1487
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:30,480
And the next minute, you're nobody.

1488
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,650
Oh, I have a nice spot for this in my relic room.

1489
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,990
Uh-oh! My mistake!

1490
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:39,700
There it goes!

1491
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:40,450
No!

1492
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,660
Bye-bye forever!

1493
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:46,700
Well, I guess there's only one thing left to do!

1494
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:50,580
Release the Kragle!

1495
01:08:52,830 --> 01:08:53,830
- Computer!   - Yes, sir.

1496
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,090
Set the electric shocker to 100 Mississippi.

1497
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:57,090
No problem.

1498
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:59,380
- Then terminate everyone.   - Already on it.

1499
01:08:59,630 --> 01:09:01,590
Emmet, that should give you enough time...

1500
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,680
...to witness the first location to be Kragled.

1501
01:09:03,930 --> 01:09:05,430
- Your hometown.   - No!

1502
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:08,390
Bad Cop, unfortunately, I'm gonna have to leave you here to die.

1503
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:09,730
What? Sir.

1504
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:11,480
It's not personal.

1505
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:13,650
It's just business.

1506
01:09:14,190 --> 01:09:16,230
Lord Business.

1507
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:17,730
Ciao.

1508
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:21,280
Beginning zapping termination...

1509
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:23,200
...in 99 Mississippi...

1510
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:25,200
...98 Mississippi...

1511
01:09:25,450 --> 01:09:27,200
97 Mississippi...

1512
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:28,950
...and so on.

1513
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,390
Attention, everyone.

1514
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:53,310
This is President Business.

1515
01:09:54,810 --> 01:09:55,600
Hello.

1516
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:57,860
Hi, welcome to Taco Tuesday!

1517
01:09:58,570 --> 01:10:00,690
Don't worry about this big black...

1518
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:02,860
...monolith thing that's blocking out the sun.

1519
01:10:03,610 --> 01:10:04,820
What you need to worry about...

1520
01:10:05,070 --> 01:10:07,490
...is this question that I'm about to ask you:

1521
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:10,120
Who wants a taco?

1522
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,460
Yeah! I know!

1523
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:17,130
Tacos, tacos! We're going crazy! Yeah.

1524
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:19,210
All right, everyone.

1525
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:20,840
Act normal.

1526
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:23,920
Perfect.

1527
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:26,760
Now, everybody say "Freeze!"

1528
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:33,480
So I guess running around and screaming is normal.

1529
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:36,310
Micro-managers, commence micro-management.

1530
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,980
Commencing micro-management.

1531
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:43,070
What's going on? I can't move!

1532
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:48,160
Please, please! Won't somebody help us?

1533
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:52,290
Emmet, you'll think of something, right? Like you always do.

1534
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:54,960
Didn't you hear him?

1535
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:57,000
The prophecy's made-up.

1536
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,790
I'm not The Special.

1537
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:03,510
And to think for a moment I thought I might be.

1538
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:07,890
- Emmet.   - Who said that?

1539
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:09,390
I did.

1540
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:12,430
I am Ghost Vitruvius.

1541
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:15,520
Woo!

1542
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:18,730
Emmet, you didn't let me finish earlier.

1543
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:20,360
Because I died.

1544
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:22,230
The reason I made up the prophecy...

1545
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,940
...was because I knew that whoever found the Piece...

1546
01:11:25,190 --> 01:11:26,820
...could become The Special.

1547
01:11:27,070 --> 01:11:29,740
Because the only thing anyone needs to be special...

1548
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:32,530
...is to believe that you can be.

1549
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:36,250
I know that sounds like a cat poster, but it's true.

1550
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:40,540
Look at what you did when you believed you were special.

1551
01:11:40,790 --> 01:11:43,210
You just need to believe it some more.

1552
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:46,720
But how can I just decide to believe that I'm special...

1553
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:48,010
...when I'm not?

1554
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:52,050
Because the world depends on it.

1555
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:59,900
Zapping termination in 35 Mississippi...

1556
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:00,730
What?

1557
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:02,110
...34 Mississippi...

1558
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:04,110
...33 Mississippi...

1559
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:06,320
...32 Mississippi...

1560
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:08,900
...31 Mississippi...

1561
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:10,570
...30 Mississippi...

1562
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:12,660
...29 Mississippi...

1563
01:12:12,910 --> 01:12:15,160
...28 Mississippi, 27 Mississippi...

1564
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:18,410
...26 Mississippi...

1565
01:12:18,910 --> 01:12:21,250
...25 Mississippi...

1566
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:22,290
...24 Mississippi...

1567
01:12:30,630 --> 01:12:31,760
Emmet!

1568
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:32,930
What are you--?

1569
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:34,640
18 Mississippi...

1570
01:12:34,890 --> 01:12:36,970
...17 Mississippi...

1571
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:38,730
-...16 Mississippi...   - Lucy!

1572
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:40,310
-...15 Mississippi...   - Wait! What are you--?

1573
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:42,770
Now it's your turn to be the hero.

1574
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:44,650
- 13 Mississippi...   - No!

1575
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:46,360
12 Mississippi...

1576
01:12:46,610 --> 01:12:48,280
See you later, alligator.

1577
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:49,150
Don't!

1578
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:53,160
No, Emmet!

1579
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:55,660
7 Mississippi...

1580
01:12:55,910 --> 01:12:57,290
6 Mississippi...

1581
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:59,370
...5 Mississippi...

1582
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:00,910
...4 Mississippi...

1583
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:02,920
...3 Mississippi...

1584
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:04,630
...2 Mississippi...

1585
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:06,340
1 Mississippi...

1586
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:08,710
...0 Missi-- Error.

1587
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,470
Termination failure.

1588
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:12,220
Emmet!

1589
01:13:19,730 --> 01:13:21,100
No.

1590
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:29,740
He... He saved us.

1591
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:32,240
Well, what do we do now?

1592
01:13:32,490 --> 01:13:33,780
There's gotta be a bright side...

1593
01:13:34,030 --> 01:13:34,740
...here somewhere.

1594
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:36,530
Does anyone have any ideas?

1595
01:13:37,450 --> 01:13:38,990
Emmet had ideas.

1596
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:43,250
Arr, if only there were more people in the world like he.

1597
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,130
Maybe there are.

1598
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:51,170
Meet me downstairs in 10 seconds.

1599
01:13:53,260 --> 01:13:55,180
Honey, where are my...

1600
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:57,220
...pant“?

1601
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:58,760
- Hi!   - Hey, guess what.

1602
01:13:59,010 --> 01:14:01,430
Found your pants. Series is over. Benny...

1603
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:03,940
...send this out to everyone in the universe.

1604
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:05,940
1980-something technology?

1605
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:07,560
Now you're talking!

1606
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:13,360
Uh... Ahem. Hey, everybody.

1607
01:14:13,610 --> 01:14:17,200
You don't know me, but I'm on TV, so you can trust me.

1608
01:14:17,450 --> 01:14:19,910
I know things seem kind of bad right now.

1609
01:14:20,410 --> 01:14:22,580
But there is a way out of this.

1610
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:25,080
This is Emmet.

1611
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:27,460
And he was just like all of you.

1612
01:14:27,710 --> 01:14:29,170
A face in the crowd...

1613
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:31,460
...following the same instructions as you.

1614
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:35,050
He was so good at fitting in, no one ever saw him.

1615
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:37,300
And I owe you an apology...

1616
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:39,930
...because I used to look down on people like that.

1617
01:14:39,930 --> 01:14:42,850
"I used to think they were followers...

1618
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:45,690
...with no ideas or vision."

1619
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:48,230
Because it turns out Emmet had great ideas.

1620
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,610
And even though they seemed weird...

1621
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:52,730
...and kind of pointless...

1622
01:14:52,990 --> 01:14:54,530
...they actually came closer...

1623
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:57,280
...than anyone else to saving the universe.

1624
01:14:57,610 --> 01:15:00,450
And now we have to finish what he started...

1625
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:04,040
...by making whatever weird thing pops into our heads.

1626
01:15:04,290 --> 01:15:07,330
All of you have the ability inside of you to be a groundbreaker.

1627
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:08,790
And I mean literally!

1628
01:15:09,670 --> 01:15:10,920
Break the ground!

1629
01:15:11,170 --> 01:15:12,090
Peel up the pieces...

1630
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:13,340
...tear apart your walls!

1631
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:15,300
Build things only you could build.

1632
01:15:15,550 --> 01:15:16,680
Defend yourselves.

1633
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:19,600
We need to fight back against President Business'...

1634
01:15:19,850 --> 01:15:21,850
plans to freeze us!

1635
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:25,020
Today will not be known as Taco Tuesday.

1636
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:28,560
It will be known as Freedom Friday!

1637
01:15:30,690 --> 01:15:32,480
But still on a Tuesday!

1638
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:40,910
End of the line.

1639
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:44,750
Bad Cop?

1640
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,080
I hope there's still a Good Cop in me somewhere.

1641
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:52,880
I'll hold these guys off. You go stop them. Yay!

1642
01:15:53,130 --> 01:15:55,550
Great idea, but how will we get there?

1643
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:57,670
T-minus one.

1644
01:15:57,930 --> 01:16:00,180
Ten, nine, eight...

1645
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:01,260
-...seven, six...   - I could, uh...

1646
01:16:02,510 --> 01:16:03,560
-...five, four...   - I could build a...

1647
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:05,430
...three, two, one.

1648
01:16:06,310 --> 01:16:07,680
I could build a spaceship!

1649
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:11,690
You're not gonna say no?

1650
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:13,690
Build away, whatever your name is.

1651
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:15,400
- Whoa! Yay!   - Ha-ha-ha!

1652
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:20,240
Okay. Spaceship! Spaceship!

1653
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:24,030
spaceship!

1654
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:26,330
spaceship!

1655
01:16:26,870 --> 01:16:27,540
spaceship!

1656
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:28,750
spaceship!

1657
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,170
spaceship!

1658
01:16:30,870 --> 01:16:31,500
spaceship!

1659
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:32,630
spaceship!

1660
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:34,340
All units, attack that spaceship.

1661
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:36,800
spaceship!

1662
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:39,010
Where'd he go?

1663
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:40,050
Spaceship!

1664
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,180
Wyldstyle, look...

1665
01:16:44,430 --> 01:16:46,560
...it's the citizens!

1666
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:53,520
Tallyho!

1667
01:16:55,690 --> 01:16:58,150
And don't forget us MasterBuilders.

1668
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,280
What is going on?

1669
01:17:00,530 --> 01:17:01,740
You stop...

1670
01:17:01,990 --> 01:17:03,070
...building that stuff!

1671
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:04,410
Just stop it!

1672
01:17:08,830 --> 01:17:09,410
Great job!

1673
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:10,750
This might actually work.

1674
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,960
'Twas your speech which roused this hearty crew.

1675
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:16,920
If only Emmet were here to see this.

1676
01:17:17,170 --> 01:17:19,340
He'd say something adorable like...

1677
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:25,970
Am I just gonna keep...

1678
01:17:26,220 --> 01:17:27,220
...falling...

1679
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:31,180
...forever?

1680
01:17:42,490 --> 01:17:44,160
Is this another vision?

1681
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:47,990
Where am I?

1682
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:52,120
Is that the Office Tower?

1683
01:17:58,670 --> 01:17:59,630
Bricksburg!

1684
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:02,300
What was that?

1685
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:05,340
No, no, no.

1686
01:18:05,970 --> 01:18:06,550
No!

1687
01:18:09,010 --> 01:18:10,560
Spaceship, spaceship, spaceship!

1688
01:18:10,810 --> 01:18:13,100
What in the world is that?

1689
01:18:15,230 --> 01:18:17,360
It's adorable.

1690
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:23,780
No. No. Whoa, no, no, no.

1691
01:18:24,030 --> 01:18:25,160
Hey, don't eat me. Don't eat me.

1692
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:26,820
Do not eat me. Please.

1693
01:18:27,410 --> 01:18:28,740
Hi, Emmet.

1694
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:30,950
Uh...

1695
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,620
Hi?

1696
01:18:35,710 --> 01:18:38,040
Is this The Man--?

1697
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:47,050
The Man Upstairs?

1698
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,020
What happened?

1699
01:18:57,020 --> 01:18:59,400
No, no, no, this is a disaster.

1700
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:03,030
Why--? Why--? What? What?

1701
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,240
What?

1702
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:08,280
Why is the dragon on top of the luxury condo development?

1703
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:09,870
But I was just playing--

1704
01:19:10,370 --> 01:19:11,700
Look, I know it's hard to understand...

1705
01:19:11,950 --> 01:19:14,080
...but this is Dad's stuff, okay?

1706
01:19:14,370 --> 01:19:16,620
All of this that you see before you...

1707
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:18,630
...is all your father's.

1708
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,750
And everything is thought-out very--

1709
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:22,300
What did you do down here?

1710
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:24,010
Did you take the top off of the tower?

1711
01:19:24,550 --> 01:19:25,880
It was an accident.

1712
01:19:26,130 --> 01:19:28,510
You accidentally...

1713
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:30,180
...expertly...

1714
01:19:30,430 --> 01:19:33,270
...carefully took the entire top off of that tower?

1715
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:34,720
Yes.

1716
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:36,640
You know the rules. This isn't a toy.

1717
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:39,600
- Um, well, it kind of is.   - No.

1718
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:43,360
Actually, it's a highly sophisticated interlocking brick system.

1719
01:19:43,610 --> 01:19:45,860
- But we bought it at the toy store.   - We did.

1720
01:19:46,110 --> 01:19:49,110
But the way I'm using it makes it an adult thing.

1721
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:51,370
The box for this one said ages 8 to 14.

1722
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:55,620
That's a suggestion. They have to put that on there.

1723
01:19:55,870 --> 01:19:58,680
You can't expect me to be able to resist playing with all this.

1724
01:19:58,730 --> 01:20:01,590
Look, You have your stuff over near the Christmas decorations.

1725
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:04,250
All those bricks, you can build anything you want.

1726
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:11,220
Finn, we're gonna play a little game. It's called:

1727
01:20:11,470 --> 01:20:14,260
"Let's Put Everything Back the Way You Found it."

1728
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:16,020
But, Dad, you don't understand.

1729
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:19,350
So I can make things the way they're supposed to be.

1730
01:20:22,610 --> 01:20:24,020
Permanently.

1731
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:28,360
More Kragles?

1732
01:20:28,610 --> 01:20:31,110
This rebellion ends right now.

1733
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:32,740
Commencing...

1734
01:20:32,990 --> 01:20:34,160
...micro-management.

1735
01:20:38,710 --> 01:20:40,330
Oh, no. No!

1736
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:47,010
Ha, ha! Fire in the hole!

1737
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:52,390
Wait, what's happening?

1738
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:55,310
No, wait! No, we're going down! Mayday!

1739
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,930
No!

1740
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:01,390
Hold on, Jeff. We're coming for you!

1741
01:21:01,650 --> 01:21:02,350
No!

1742
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:03,230
Stop!

1743
01:21:03,940 --> 01:21:04,690
Oh, no!

1744
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:16,160
Arr, there be too many Micro-managers!

1745
01:21:16,410 --> 01:21:17,700
What am I holding here?

1746
01:21:17,950 --> 01:21:20,790
-It's a battleship.   - No, it's a hodgepodge. That's what it is.

1747
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:22,250
What's Batman doing on it?

1748
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:24,420
What is this, a robot pirate?

1749
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,090
Stop! Stop it! No! Stop it! Stop!

1750
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:31,340
You got glue all over that construction worker.

1751
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,800
Here. Give that to me.

1752
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:37,560
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

1753
01:21:37,610 --> 01:21:39,060
All of those are my friends! No, stop it!

1754
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:42,690
Ye were a hearty crew. But it be...

1755
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:45,270
It be over.

1756
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:47,360
No!

1757
01:21:50,190 --> 01:21:51,530
The Piece of Resistance!

1758
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:53,280
I can still save them!

1759
01:21:53,530 --> 01:21:56,950
Let's get this gunk off this construction worker.

1760
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:59,490
He's not just a construction worker, Dad. He's the hero.

1761
01:21:59,740 --> 01:22:01,410
Nope, he's not.

1762
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:04,250
He is a ordinary, regular...

1763
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:06,080
...generic construction worker...

1764
01:22:06,330 --> 01:22:09,050
...and I need to put him back where he belongs.

1765
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:13,170
Now, where is my X-Acto knife?

1766
01:22:16,010 --> 01:22:18,640
I gotta get the Piece of Resistance.

1767
01:22:19,390 --> 01:22:22,520
If I could get the attention of the smaller creature.

1768
01:22:23,270 --> 01:22:24,350
I gotta move.

1769
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,730
Where is that?

1770
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:28,770
Move!

1771
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,410
All right.

1772
01:23:00,430 --> 01:23:01,010
Move!

1773
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:07,940
Now, I didn't move--

1774
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:12,780
OW.

1775
01:23:15,570 --> 01:23:16,860
- Uh, Dad?   - Yeah.

1776
01:23:17,110 --> 01:23:20,080
I think I saw the X-Acto over there near Middle Zealand.

1777
01:23:20,330 --> 01:23:21,660
Oh, great. Thank you.

1778
01:23:21,910 --> 01:23:23,080
Welcome.

1779
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:32,500
It's up to you now, Emmet.

1780
01:23:42,390 --> 01:23:43,720
Believe.

1781
01:23:44,970 --> 01:23:47,390
I know that sounds like a cat poster...

1782
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:49,230
...but it's true.

1783
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:58,490
Whoa!

1784
01:24:11,290 --> 01:24:12,290
Sorry, street.

1785
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:19,510
Ho-ho!

1786
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:27,390
I can see everything.

1787
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:31,600
Ha, ha!

1788
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:33,310
What the heck is this?

1789
01:24:33,570 --> 01:24:35,610
I am a MasterBuilder.

1790
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:41,030
Release every Micro-manager we have!

1791
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,870
Let's get him, fellas!

1792
01:24:46,870 --> 01:24:48,040
Hey, everyone!

1793
01:24:48,290 --> 01:24:50,170
- Emmet!   - Emmet! Yay!

1794
01:24:53,170 --> 01:24:55,710
Lucy, I'm going inside that thing.

1795
01:24:56,250 --> 01:24:57,210
You've got it, Emmet.

1796
01:24:57,460 --> 01:25:00,010
Take that! Ha, ha!

1797
01:25:00,260 --> 01:25:01,430
Good night! Come here!

1798
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:03,300
We'll help you out, kid.

1799
01:25:03,550 --> 01:25:06,060
Here's how we do it pirate-style!

1800
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:09,640
Yes! Emmet! That's it!

1801
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:13,730
Take him down, boys!

1802
01:25:17,650 --> 01:25:18,650
Emmet!

1803
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:22,860
Stay positive.

1804
01:25:23,990 --> 01:25:25,160
They're tearing me apart!

1805
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:27,790
Stay positive.

1806
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:28,910
Come on!

1807
01:25:29,330 --> 01:25:30,750
Oh, forget it!

1808
01:25:36,290 --> 01:25:38,960
You all need to be more friendly!

1809
01:25:41,590 --> 01:25:42,590
Emmet, go!

1810
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:43,930
Go! Now's your...

1811
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:45,550
- ...chance!   - She's right!

1812
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:48,640
- You can do it, me laddie!   - Go on, kid. Get in there!

1813
01:25:56,310 --> 01:25:57,230
Sir, we got an intrud--!

1814
01:25:59,230 --> 01:26:00,360
Lord Business.

1815
01:26:00,610 --> 01:26:02,280
Back from the dead, Brickowski?

1816
01:26:02,530 --> 01:26:03,660
Well, you're too late!

1817
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:05,280
Skeletrons, get him!

1818
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:17,790
Argh! I can't move!

1819
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:20,090
You see, your friends...

1820
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:21,130
...oh, they're finished!

1821
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:23,720
My world is almost finished.

1822
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:27,930
The last thing I need to do is finish...

1823
01:26:28,180 --> 01:26:29,640
-...you.   - No, stop! Please!

1824
01:26:29,890 --> 01:26:32,520
If you do one more thing, I'm gonna unleash my secret weapon.

1825
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:34,390
Your secret weapon?

1826
01:26:35,140 --> 01:26:37,520
Yes, it's called:

1827
01:26:37,770 --> 01:26:39,770
The Power of The Special.

1828
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:41,280
That sounds dumb.

1829
01:26:42,070 --> 01:26:45,450
All right, here it comes. My secret weapon...

1830
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:47,740
...is this.

1831
01:26:49,030 --> 01:26:51,620
What is that? Is it super small? I don't see anything.

1832
01:26:51,870 --> 01:26:54,040
It's my hand. I want you to take it.

1833
01:26:54,290 --> 01:26:55,670
You want me to take your hand off?

1834
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:58,590
No, I want you to join me.

1835
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:02,130
Look at all of these things that people built.

1836
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:03,720
You might see a mess...

1837
01:27:03,970 --> 01:27:06,590
Exactly. And a bunch of weird, dorky stuff...

1838
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:09,100
...that ruined my perfectly good stuff!

1839
01:27:10,050 --> 01:27:11,930
Okay. What I see...

1840
01:27:12,430 --> 01:27:15,600
...are people inspired by each other...

1841
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:17,560
...and by you.

1842
01:27:18,690 --> 01:27:21,230
People taking what you made...

1843
01:27:21,770 --> 01:27:24,030
...and making something new out of it.

1844
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:42,210
Finn, did you make all of this?

1845
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:47,590
The people are trying to stop President Business...

1846
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:49,720
...from using the Kragle.

1847
01:27:50,550 --> 01:27:51,890
What's the Kragle?

1848
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:55,350
Um, it's in there.

1849
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:59,020
In here?

1850
01:28:36,980 --> 01:28:40,770
So President Business is the bad guy?

1851
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:49,990
If...

1852
01:28:51,450 --> 01:28:53,950
If the construction guy...

1853
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:56,740
...said something to President Business...

1854
01:29:00,710 --> 01:29:02,460
...what would he say?

1855
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:10,430
You...

1856
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:14,100
...don't have to be...

1857
01:29:15,010 --> 01:29:16,350
...the bad guy.

1858
01:29:18,890 --> 01:29:19,560
You...

1859
01:29:20,350 --> 01:29:22,100
...are the most talented...

1860
01:29:23,150 --> 01:29:24,480
...most interesting...

1861
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:29,190
...and most extraordinary person in the universe.

1862
01:29:30,820 --> 01:29:33,990
And you are capable of amazing things...

1863
01:29:34,740 --> 01:29:38,490
...because you are The Special.

1864
01:29:41,870 --> 01:29:43,210
And so am I.

1865
01:29:46,170 --> 01:29:47,880
And so is everyone.

1866
01:29:49,340 --> 01:29:51,380
The prophecy is made-up...

1867
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:54,050
...but it's also true.

1868
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:55,970
It's about all of us.

1869
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:59,060
Right now, it's about you.

1870
01:30:00,390 --> 01:30:01,730
And you...

1871
01:30:02,850 --> 01:30:04,310
...still...

1872
01:30:05,060 --> 01:30:07,230
...can change everything.

1873
01:30:32,470 --> 01:30:34,340
Oh, we got a hugger.

1874
01:30:36,890 --> 01:30:37,970
Be careful.

1875
01:30:38,220 --> 01:30:41,600
I have been told it might explode.

1876
01:30:54,740 --> 01:30:57,070
Emmet, thank you.

1877
01:30:57,320 --> 01:30:59,780
And I just want you to know, from the bottom of my heart...

1878
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:01,790
...from this moment forward...

1879
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:04,370
...I solemnly promise that I will never--

1880
01:31:13,970 --> 01:31:15,420
Emmet!

1881
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:17,970
Hey, everyone! ls everyone okay?

1882
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:19,760
Where's Lucy?

1883
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:21,060
Emmet!

1884
01:31:21,310 --> 01:31:22,720
Lucy!

1885
01:31:25,890 --> 01:31:27,190
We did it.

1886
01:31:33,230 --> 01:31:35,490
Oh. Uh, Emmet, wait.

1887
01:31:36,070 --> 01:31:38,740
Batman, there's something I need to say to you.

1888
01:31:38,990 --> 01:31:40,580
No. Wyldstyle--

1889
01:31:40,830 --> 01:31:42,030
I mean...

1890
01:31:42,740 --> 01:31:44,120
...Lucy.

1891
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:47,370
He's the hero you deserve.

1892
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:52,550
- Uh...   - Thanks, Batman.

1893
01:32:04,100 --> 01:32:06,770
I liked Emmet before it was cool.

1894
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:09,650
Whoops, I have the antidote for the Kragle.

1895
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:11,360
How did that happen?

1896
01:32:11,610 --> 01:32:13,020
Yay!

1897
01:32:13,270 --> 01:32:14,440
- De-Kragler.   - Watch this.

1898
01:32:14,690 --> 01:32:15,820
- Yay!   - Oh, Mommy, Daddy.

1899
01:32:16,070 --> 01:32:16,990
You're okay!

1900
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:18,820
- Oh, son!   - Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

1901
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:22,070
We're okay, son. Ha, ha.

1902
01:32:22,330 --> 01:32:24,950
Guys, time to come up for dinner. It's Taco Tuesday, your favorite.

1903
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:28,330
- Okay, honey. We'll be up in a sec.   - Yeah, we'll be up in a sec!

1904
01:32:28,830 --> 01:32:30,500
- I gotta tell you something.   - What?

1905
01:32:30,750 --> 01:32:32,590
Now that I'm letting you come down here and play...

1906
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:34,500
...guess who else gets to come down here and play'?

1907
01:32:34,750 --> 01:32:36,130
- Who?   - Your sister.

1908
01:32:36,380 --> 01:32:37,130
What?

1909
01:32:37,380 --> 01:32:39,340
Well, things sure have a way of working out smoothly.

1910
01:32:39,590 --> 01:32:40,300
Am I right, GUYS?

1911
01:32:40,550 --> 01:32:42,300
What?

1912
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:50,020
We're from the Planet Duplon.

1913
01:32:50,270 --> 01:32:53,480
We are here to destroy you.

1914
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:56,610
Oh, man.

1915
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:59,540
Yes, this is real music.

1916
01:38:00,700 --> 01:38:02,330
Dark, brooding...

1917
01:38:02,790 --> 01:38:04,420
...important...

1918
01:38:04,670 --> 01:38:06,000
...groundbreaking.

1919
01:38:07,630 --> 01:38:08,670
Check out the lyrics.

1920
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:12,760
Darkness

1921
01:38:14,390 --> 01:38:16,430
No parents

1922
01:38:19,140 --> 01:38:20,930
Continued darkness

1923
01:38:21,180 --> 01:38:22,940
More darkness. Get it?

1924
01:38:23,190 --> 01:38:25,060
The opposite of light

1925
01:38:25,770 --> 01:38:27,190
Black hole

1926
01:38:27,980 --> 01:38:29,190
Curtains drawn

1927
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:32,360
In the basement

1928
01:38:33,490 --> 01:38:35,070
Middle of the night

1929
01:38:36,450 --> 01:38:38,450
Blacked-out windows

1930
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:41,540
Other places that are dark

1931
01:38:43,790 --> 01:38:45,000
Black suit

1932
01:38:46,210 --> 01:38:47,710
Black coffee

1933
01:38:48,460 --> 01:38:50,630
You get it. That's just the first verse.

1934
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:52,720
Darkness

1935
01:38:54,010 --> 01:38:55,880
No parents

1936
01:38:57,140 --> 01:38:58,390
Super rich

1937
01:38:59,930 --> 01:39:01,600
Kind of makes it better
