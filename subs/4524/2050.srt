一切妙不可言

156
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,860

163
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,620
大香肠  不是吧
Giant sausages? No way!

164
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,420
你知道我喜欢干什么吗
You know what I love to do?

165
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,460
是和我生命中重要的人一起进餐

166
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:02,960

Ah! No, wait, guys!

168
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,920
别飞走  好吧  我们待会在体育酒吧会面
Wait up! Okay, I'll meet you there.

169
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,510
哦  它飞哪去了
Oh. Where did it go?

170
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,680
好吧  你在这啊
Oh, there you are.

171
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,020
我好像听到什么东西飞过去的声音
I think I heard a whoosh.

172
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,720
宝物探测中

173
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,820
找到宝物

174
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,230
嘿  朋友  虽然我很讨厌这么说
Hey, pal, I hate to tell you this...

175
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,820
但是  我觉得这不是你该呆的地方
...but, uh, I don't think you're supposed to be here.

176
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,910
《指导手册》中明确规定
Yeah, the rules specifically state...

177
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,830
工作场所六点关闭  并且这是必须带安全帽的区域
...work site closes at 6, it's a hard-hat area only.

178
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,910
你的穿着不是正规的安全橙色
That's not official safety orange.

179
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,040
"如果你看到什么奇怪的事情  立马禀报"
"If you see anything weird, report it immediately."

180
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,210
既然这样  那我想我得
Well, I guess I'm gonna...

181
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,760
要举报你了
...have to report youuu...

182
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,400
小姐  你要去哪  我并没有打算吓你的  我...
Where are you going? Miss! I didn't mean to scare you! I'm sor--

183
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,960
嘿  看来也不是很糟糕嘛
Hey! Heh. That's not so bad.

184
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,650
那是什么
What is that?

185
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,860
过来
Come here.

186
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,400
我该怎么做  我把《指导手册》搞丢了
What do I do? I don't have my instructions.

187
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,240
伸手来触摸我
Touch the Piece.

188
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,950
伸手来触摸我  伸手来触摸我
Touch the Piece. Touch the Piece.

189
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:04,500
我感觉也许我应该过去触摸它
I feel like maybe I should touch that.

190
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,540
这真是太
It's so...

191
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,960
有趣了
. . . interesting.

192
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,460
伸手来触摸我
Touch the Piece.

193
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,380
这真是太有趣了
It's so interesting.

194
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,760
伸手来触摸我

195
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,550
伸手来触摸我

196
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,020

00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,060
触摸
Touch the--

198
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,110
一个拥有黄皮肤的救世主
A Special One with face of yellow

199
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,610
将会在地底的洞穴中
Will make the Piece of Resistance found

200
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,440
找到反抗法宝
From its hiding refuge underground

201
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:34,990
发生什么事了
What's going on down here?

202
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,410
这个建筑大师将会阻止克拉格并且拯救这个世界
This MasterBuilder will thwart The Kragle and save the realm

203
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,580
快点  埃米特
Come on, Emmet!

204
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,870
救世主已经诞生
The Special has arisen.

205
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,910
轮到你当英雄了
It's your turn to be the hero.

206
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,750
醒醒
Wake up.

207
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,120
快点醒过来
Come on, wake up!

208
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,460
建筑大师在哪
Where are the MasterBuilders?

209
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,540
你怎么找到反抗法宝的
How did you find the Piece of Resistance? Eh?

210
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,960
-其他的藏在哪？    -早安  我的公寓
- Where are the others hiding?   - Good morning, apartment?

211
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:53,960
醒醒
Wake up!

212
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,970
你是怎么找到反抗法宝的
How did you find the Piece of Resistance?

213
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,180
什么的法宝？
The piece of what?

214
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,260
反抗法宝
The Piece of Resistance.

215
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,720
我...我不...我这是在哪？  发生什么事了
I-- I don't-- Where am I? What's happening?

216
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,890
"发生什么事了？"
"What's happening?"

217
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,940
跟我装聋作哑吗  建筑大师
Playing dumb, MasterBuilder.

218
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,560
不  我... 建筑大师？
No. I-- "MasterBuilder"?

219
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,400
-你是想告诉我你从来没有听说过预言    -是的
- Oh. So you've never heard of the prophecy?    - No.

220
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,230
或者救世主
Or The Special?

221
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,150
没有
No, no!

222
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,990
你这个骗子  我们会杀了你
You're a liar! We'll kill you!

223
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,740
听着  我在电视上看到过很多警匪片
Look, urn, I watch a lot of cop shows on TV.

224
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,370
不是应该还有...
Isn't there supposed to also be--?

225
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,620
不是应该还有个好警察吗
Isn't there supposed to be a good cop?

226
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,630
是的  但我们的帐还没算完呢
Oh, yes. But we're not done yet.

227
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,960
嗨  朋友  我是你友好的邻里警察
Hi, buddy! I'm your friendly neighborhood police officer!

228
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,300
-想要喝杯茶吗    -还真想喝
- Would you like a glass of water?   - Yeah. Yeah, actually.

229
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,300
真遗憾  你喝不到了
Too bad.

230
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,050
安全摄像头拍下了这个
Security cameras picked up this.

231
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,060
你在建筑工地被发现的时候  正背着一块奇怪的东西抽搐
Unh! You were found at the construction site convulsing with a strange piece.

232
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,220
真是太恶心了
That's disgusting!

233
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,810
那它为什么牢固的粘在了你的背上
Then why is it permanently stuck to your back?

234
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,980
把它从我背上拿下来  把它从我背上拿下来
Get it off me! Get it off me!

235
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,400
它掉不下来  它粘在我身上了
It won't come off! It's chasing me!

236
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,030
听着  这不是我的错
Look, it's not my fault!

237
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,940
我也不知道这东西怎么会粘到了我的背上
I have no idea how this thing got on my back!

238
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,950
朋友  我当然相信你
Of course, buddy. I believe you.

239
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,860
太好了
Great.

240
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,570
我也相信你
I "believe" you too.

241
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,570
{\an8}用两种不同的口气说  是因为之前说应该有好坏两个警察的缘故

242
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,240
你看到我用爪形手做的手势了吗
You see the quotations I'm making with my claw hands?

243
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,700
这意味着我并不相信你
It means I don't believe you!

244
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,620
为什么偏偏就在总统大人
Why else would you show up with that thing on your back...

245
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,540
准备用克拉格来毁灭这个世界的前三天
...just three days before President Business...

246
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,000
这个东西就出现在你的背上
...is going to use the Kragle to end the world?

247
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,300
总统大人准备毁灭这个世界？
President Business is gonna end the world?

248
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,840
但他是个很好的人啊
But he's such a good guy.

249
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,260
还有奥坦公司  他们总是能做出好东西
And Octan, they make good stuff.

250
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,890
音乐  乳酪产品  咖啡  电视节目
Music, dairy products, coffee, TV shows...

251
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,350
监控系统  历史书  投票机
...surveillance systems, all history books, voting machines.

252
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,260
等等
Wait a minute.

253
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,980
你不会真的这么愚蠢吧
Come on, you can't be this stupid.

254
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,600
这是个误会
This is a misunderstanding.

255
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,650
我只是个平凡的普通人
I'm just a regular, normal, ordinary guy.

256
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,980
并且我已经要迟到了  我得去见我最好的朋友
I'm late to meet my best friends in the whole world.

257
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,020
他们现在可能已经在想我了
They're probably missing me right now.

258
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,730
他们可能已经在外面四处找我了
They're probably out looking around.

259
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,110
"嘿  埃米特在哪里？  我最好的朋友埃米特在哪里？"
"Hey, where's Emmet? Hey, where's my best friend Emmet?"

260
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,610
你知道吗  你可以去问我所有的朋友  他们会告诉你的
Hey, you know what? Ask all my friends. They'll tell you.

261
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,530
哦  我们已经问过他们了
Oh, we asked them, all right.

262
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,950
埃米特啊  他不像是个犯罪首脑
That guy's not a criminal mastermind.

263
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,000
看到没
See?

264
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,670
他就是个平平常常的普通人
Yeah. You know, he's kind of an average, normal kind of guy.

265
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,830
谢谢
Thank you.

266
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:54,790
但是  你知道吗  他不是
But, you know, he's not, like...

267
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,210
他的平凡和我们不一样
...normal like us. No.

268
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,170
他没有那么特别
He's not that special.

269
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,180
等等  我有点困惑  我们到底在说谁
Wait, I'm so confused. Who are we talking about?

270
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,390
他和我们一起工作吗
Wait, does he work with us?

271
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,970
盖尔不记得我了？
Gail doesn't remember me?

272
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,100
比如说兰迪
Look at Randy here.

273
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,850
他喜欢香肠  这是他的特色
He likes sausage. That's something.

274
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,650
盖尔很活泼  这是她的特色
Gail is perky. That's something.

275
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,440
还有哈利
And Harry...

276
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:19,860
当你说起哈利的时候  我会捧腹大笑
When you say Harry, I go: Haaa

277
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,490
当你说其他人的时候  我就
When you say the other guy, I go:

278
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,660
哈利是最棒的
Harry's the best!

279
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,030
-哈利很有个性    -他很古怪  他很古怪
- Harry's got personality.   - He's weird! He's weird!

280
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,450
我知道埃米特  但是也仅此而已
I know that guy but I know, like, zippy-zap about him.

281
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,160
我们早上还刚谈论过
We just talked earlier.

282
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,210
我的意思是  他只会说是的
I mean, all he does is say yes...

283
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,500
附和其他人
...to everything everybody else is doing.

284
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,880
他就是有点...
You know, he's just sort of a "Hmm!"

285
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,840
有点白痴吧  我认为
Little bit of a blank slate, I guess.

286
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,890
总共是42美元
That'll be $42, please.

287
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:49,100
我们都有自己的特色  但是埃米特
We all have something that makes us something and Emmet is...

288
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,730
一无是处
...nothing.

289
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,860
你看到了
There you go.

290
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,110
我跟你说我就是个普通的小人物
I told you I was a nobody.

291
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,900
这是最完美的掩饰
It's the perfect cover.

292
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,820
掩饰？  掩饰什么？
Cover? Cover for what?

293
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,660
我从他这得不到什么信息  把他带到熔化室去
I can't break him. Take him to the melting chamber.

294
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,740
什么？
What?

295
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,120
你要熔化了我？  我会死吗？
You're gonna melt me'? Am I gonna die?

296
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,710
你会活着  你会活得好好的
You'll live. You'll be fine.

297
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,420
总统先生  他现在就在我手里
President Business. I have him right here, sir.

298
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:22,630
是的  我告诉他他会活下去  所以他没有逃跑  但是...
Yes, we've told him he'll live so he doesn't try to escape, but, um...

299
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,130
我们是在骗他而已
...we're lying to him.

300
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,890
等等  你刚说什么
Wait, what did he just say?

301
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,050
别动
Hold still.

302
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,220
等等  这肯定是搞错了  你们抓错人了
Wait! There's obviously been a mix-up here. You've got the wrong--

303
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,400
这很快就会开始疼了
That is gonna start hurting pretty soon.

304
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,510
不  不  不要
No, no, no!

305
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,850
你是谁
Whoa. Who are you?

306
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,600
是你啊
It's you?

307
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,600
如果你不想死的话  就跟我走吧
Come with me if you wanna not die.

308
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,230
嗨  各位  熔化的怎么样了
Hi, everybody! How's the melting goi--?

309
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,150
嘿  嘿  嘿
Hey, hey, hey”

310
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,240
红色警报  红色警报
Red alert, red alert.

311
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,950
所有人都过来  我再说一遍  所有人都给我去追救世主
I need everyone, repeat: everyone, to go after The Special.

312
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,330
隧道在这个个方向
The tunnel's that way.

313
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,410
哦  天呐
Oh, boy!

314
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,250
先生  你真是太有才了
Oh, sir, you're brilliant.

315
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,250
我们要建造个摩托车冲出去
We'll build a motorcycle out of the alleyway.

316
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,430
还不知道你的名字呢
So, uh, didn't catch your name...

317
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:58,020
或者你准备做什么
...or anything about what you're, uh, up to.

318
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,690
或者我们在这干什么
Or what we're doing here.

319
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,190
先生  把你自己装成是个无用的小人物  这个做法真是太聪明了
It's brilliant, sir, that you pretended to be a useless nobody...

320
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,070
但你也可以跟我一起坐摩托战车  没事的
...but you can drop the act with me. It's cool.

321
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,780
哦  摩托战车
Oh, the act.

322
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,450
跳上来  我们出发吧
Jump on. Let's go!

323
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,370
-嘿  我    -抓紧了  先生
- Hey, uh, I--   - Hang on, sir.

324
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,460
所有单位
All units...

325
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,420
截住他们  现在
...cut him off on Elm, now!

326
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,800
或者你可以的时候
Or whenever you can.

327
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,380
10-4  坏警察
10-4, Bad Cop.

328
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,920
-小心    -抓紧了
- Watch out!   - Hold on.

329
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,390
我们需要去和维特鲁威会和
We need to meet up with Vitruvius...

330
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,310
并且告诉他法宝已经找到了
...and tell him the Piece has been found.

331
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,720
他们在单轨铁路上面
They're up on the monorail.

332
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,430
派出直升机
Release the copper choppers.

333
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,440
哦  不
Oh, no!

334
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,410
你能告诉我发生什么事情了吗
Will you please tell me what is happening?

335
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,120
我在营救你  先生  你是预言提到的那个人
I'm rescuing you, sir. You're the one the prophecy spoke of.

336
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,200
你是救世主
You're The Special.

337
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,370
我？
Me?

338
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,500
你找到了反抗法宝
You found the Piece of Resistance.

339
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,040
而且预言中说
And the prophecy states...

340
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,460
你是这个世界最重要  最才华横溢
...that you are the most important, most talented...

341
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,840
最风趣
...most interesting...

342
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:10,090
和最杰出的人
...and most extraordinary person in the universe.

343
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,130
那说的就是你  对吗？
That's you. Right?

344
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,510
是的  就是我
Uh, yes. That's me.

345
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,720
太好了  你来开
Great. You drive.

346
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:18,470
什么
What?

347
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:28,860
我想回家
I wanna go home!

348
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,700
我不是说这个
This is not what I meant!

349
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:41,500
哦  不
Oh, no.

350
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,540
小心  救世主
Look out, Special!

351
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,380
抱歉  第一次驾驶摩托车 对不起
Uh, sorry. Never driven a motorcycle. Sorry!

352
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,760
他太神奇了
Wow, he's amazing.

353
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,350
真是难以置信
That was incredible!

354
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,850
你简直比预言中说的还好
You're even better than the prophecy said you'd be.

355
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,270
真的吗
Oh. Really?

356
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,140
我是...我是温斯黛
I'm, uh-- I'm Wyldstyle.

357
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,150
-哦  对不起  你说什么    -温斯黛
- Oh, I'm sorry, what was it?   - Wyldstyle.

358
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,480
-温斯黛    -是的
- "Wyldstyle"?   - Yep.

359
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:07,770
-你做什么的  DJ吗？    -不是
- What are you, a DJ?   - No.

360
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:07,770
{\an8}DJ是指从事电台广播剧、电视台新闻报道等电子媒体节目播音工作的人

361
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,070
-哦  那是你的名字啊  温斯黛    -是的
- Oh, that's your name? "Wyldstyle"?   - Yeah.

362
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,860
就像你的出生证明上  写着温斯黛
Like on your birth certificate, it says "Wyldstyle."

363
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:12,780
我们还是不要讨论我的名字了
Let's not talk about my name!

364
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,410
别让救世主跑了
Don't let The Special get away.

365
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,660
长官  我们已经封锁了高速公路
Sir, we've blocked the freeway.

366
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,120
抓紧了
Hang on, sir!

367
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:18,990
你干嘛呢
What are you doing?

368
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:21,830
让我们飞起来吧
Let's fly!

369
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,620
飞向秘密通道
Head for the secret tunnel.

370
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,170
额  这里是城市禁区
Uh, these are the city limits.

371
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,290
我们飞向通道就好了
Let's just head for the tunnel.

372
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,300
你想让我开进那奇怪的涡旋形的洞？
You want me to drive into that weird swirly hole?

373
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,130
你疯了吗
Are you insane?

374
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,090
不要刹车  冲  不要停下来  冲啊
Don't brake! Go! Don't stop! Go! Now!

375
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,180
我做不到
I can't do this!

376
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,850
这是违反规定的
That is against the instructions!

377
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,720
等等  你最喜欢的餐馆是哪个
Wait, what's your favorite restaurant?

378
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:41,770
阿尼连锁餐馆
Any chain restaurant.

379
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,520

381
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,020
最喜欢的歌
Favorite song?

382
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,310
一切妙不可言
Everything ls Awesome

383
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,560
哦  不
Oh, no!

384
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,320
等等  我们在哪
Wait. Where are we?

385
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,320
旧西部

386
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,410
这真是太奇怪了
This is so weir--!

387
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,700
你不是救世主  你骗我
You're not The Special! You lied to me!

388
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,580
这真的得看情况
It really kind of depends on--

389
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,460
你甚至不是个建造大师  对吧
You're not even a MasterBuilder, are you?

390
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,790
额  我的意思是  我知道什么是建造大师
Uh, I mean, I know what a MasterBuilder is.

391
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,010
不如你告诉我建造大师是干嘛的  那样的话我就知道你是不是对的
Why don't you tell me what it is? That way I could see if you're right.

392
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,510
你毁了预言
You've ruined the prophecy.

393
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:01,010
听着  我很抱歉  只是...
Look, I'm sorry, okay? You just--

394
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,470
被人当成救世主的感觉很好
You made being special sound so good.

395
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,480
我还以为可以一直跟你到达世界的尽头
And to think I was going to follow you to the end of the universe.

396
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,520
真的？
You were?

397
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:09,980
是这样的
Here's the thing.

398
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,730
我们怎么就能确定我不是救世主呢
How do we know for sure that I'm not The Special?

399
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,440
-我们还不确定呢    -安静
- We just don't know it yet.   - Quiet.

400
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,280
你们想要巨大的火鸡腿吗
Y'all want a giant turkey leg?

401
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,490
你知道这东西会对你的结肠造成什么影响吗
Do you have any idea what that does to your colon?

402
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,870
-哦  我的天呐    -把这帽子戴上
- Oh, my G-O-S-H.   - Just put the hat on.

403
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,660
还有这个  这个  这个
...and this. And this. And this.

404
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,460
和这个
And this.

405
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,330
顺带说一句  我有男朋友了
And, by the way, I have a boyfriend.

406
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,670
额  我不太明白你为什么要说这个
Uh, I'm not sure exactly why you'd bring that up.

407
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,840
这事情很严重
It's super serious.

408
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,500
你不会想要招惹他的
You do not want to mess with him.

409
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,260
好吧
Okay

410
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,670
所以  别打我的主意了
So don't get any ideas.

411
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,590
我从来没有过什么想法
I never have any ideas.

412
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,260
等等
Wait!

413
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,550
-把他们吊起来    -把手放到我看得到的地方
- Stick them up.   - Hands where I can see them.

414
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,770
嘿  听着  你可以解释下为什么我要穿成这样吗
Hey, uh, listen. You think you can explain why I'm dressed like this...

415
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,480
还有天上这个大大的词是怎么回事
...and what those big words in the sky were all about?

416
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,190
还有  我们处在什么年代
And, like, where we are in time.

417
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:56,480
你家  砖块城堡  只是宇宙中许多领域中的一个
Your home, Bricksburg, is one of many realms in the universe.

418
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,650
还有这一个
There's also this one...

419
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,240
海盗湾  骑士俱乐部  维京人  小丑镇
...Pirate's Cove, Knight's Club, Viking's Landing, Clown Town...

420
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,700
以及很多我们没必要提及的地方
...a bunch of others we don't need to mention.

421
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,490
邪恶暴君  或者你认为的
Lord Business, or as you think you know him...

422
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,870
总统先生
...President Business...

423
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,950
偷了克拉格  这个世界上最强大的武器
...stole the Kragle, the most powerful object in the universe.

424
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,870
等等...
Blah, blah, blah.

425
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,920
正确的名字  地名以及一些其他的事情
Proper name. Place name. Backstory stuff.

426
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,380
反抗法宝  救世主
...Piece of Resistance is The Special.

427
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,010
我很漂亮  我喜欢你
I'm so pretty. I like you.

428
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,550
但由于一些原因  我很生你的气
But I'm angry with you for some reason.

429
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,050
...宇宙的尽头...
...tower at the end of the universe...

430
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,010
把反抗法宝放到克拉格之上
...put the Piece of Resistance onto the Kragle...

431
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,890
就能永久的消灭它
...and disarm it forever.

432
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,100
太好了
Great.

433
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,390
我觉得我已经明白了
I think I got it...

434
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,680
但为了以防万一
...but just in case...

435
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,480
你把所有的事情再给我说一遍  我刚才没听
...tell me the whole thing again. I wasn't listening.

436
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:38,070
好吧  曾经这个世界上的人们  可以
Okay. All the people of the universe were once free to travel...

437
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,280
随意往来他们想去的地方
...and mingle and build whatever they wanted.

438
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,660
但邪恶暴君看不惯这样的混乱
But President Business was confused by all the chaos.

439
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,490
所以他在不同的领域间建立起了墙来阻隔
So he erected walls between the worlds...

440
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,410
并逐渐沉迷于秩序和完美
...and became obsessed with order and perfection.

441
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,040
然后他偷了神秘的
And he stole the mysterious...

442
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,120
超强武器——克拉格
...secret super weapon called-- The Kragle!

443
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:54,540
并且雇佣坏警察
and he hired Bad Cop...

444
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:57,340
来追杀所有的建筑大师  一群善于创造和改变的人
...to hunt down all the MasterBuilders, who were always changing everything.

445
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,670
我们剩下的人
And those of us who remained...

446
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,550
消身匿迹的躲了起来  并且建造了神秘隧道
...well, we went into hiding. Built the tunnels to survive.

447
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,470
我们一直在找寻反抗法宝
And we search for the Piece of Resistance.

448
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,310
唯一一件可以阻止克拉格的法宝
The only thing that can stop the Kragle.

449
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,720
克拉格  我知道这个
Kragle. I know that.

450
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,020
抓我的那个警察  他曾经说过一些关于克拉格的事
It might have been that cop. He said something about the Kragle.

451
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,440
邪恶暴君准备用克拉格
President Business was going to use the Kragle...

452
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,940
在三天后毁灭世界
...to end the world in three days.

453
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,230
我完全不明白什么意思
I can't make any sense of it.

454
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,570
墨西哥卷饼星期二
Taco Tuesday.

455
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,980
我就知道那很可疑  我们没时间浪费了
I knew that was suspicious. There's no time to lose.

456
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:24,200
我们必须找到维特鲁威  然后赶去奥坦大厦
We must find Vitruvius and get to the Office Tower before it's too late.

457
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,450
好吧
Okay

458
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,820
一个人的办公室能有什么可怕的
Heh. How scary can someone's office be?

459
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,340
总统大人  我们在尝试追踪逃犯
President Business, we're trying to locate the fugitive...

460
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,880
但是它的面孔实在太普通了  能和我们数据库中的每一个人匹配
...but his face is so generic it matches every other face in our database.

461
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,680
恶毒的
Diabolical.

462
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,890
好的  让坏警察在23秒内
Okay, have Bad Cop meet me in my office...

463
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,680
-到我的办公见我  恰奥    -好的  长官
-...in 23 seconds. Ciao.   - Will do, sir.

464
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,720
咖啡销售已经再创新高  先生
Coffee sales are through the roof, sir.

465
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:54,270
很好  让我们把屋顶建得再高点
Glad to hear it. Let's rebuild that roof to be even higher!

466
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,640
屋顶团队已经在施工了
The roof team is on it.

467
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:58,110
长官  这张给墨西哥卷饼星期二的海报可以吗
Sir, can you approve this poster for Taco Tuesday?

468
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,400
完美
Perfect.

469
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,400
-我爱这间房间里的所有人    -我们也爱你  先生
- I love everyone in this room.   - We love you, sir!

470
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:04,070
-无线电台的工作做得很好    -多谢夸奖
- Great job on the radio station.   - Thank you, sir.

471
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,360
我们喜欢一遍又一遍的听着这首歌
We love listening to this song over and over again.

472
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:07,410
保持下去  伙计们
Keep it up, GUYS-

473
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,660
亲爱的  我的裤子在哪里
Honey, where are my pants?

474
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,120
停
Cut!

475
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,000
令人捧腹大笑  这永远也不会过时
Hilarious. That never gets old.

476
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,160
确实不会
It does not.

477
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,750
坏警察已经在您办公室等您了
Bad Cop is waiting for you in your office.

478
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,250
太好了
Wonderful. Fantastic.

479
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,290
你可以取消我2点的安排吗
Would you cancel my 2:00?

480
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,670
接下来这个会议可能会有点
This next meeting could run a little bit...

481
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,920
血腥
...deadly.

482
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:33,890
激活头盔
Activate helmet.

483
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,480
灯光启动中
Light sequence.

484
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,440
火焰测试
Flame test.

485
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,480
大门开启
Engage dramatic entrance.

486
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:41,940
坏警察
Bad Cop.

487
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,190
商业之王  我知道救世主跑了  但是
Lord Business. I know The Special got away, but--

488
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,190
别这么紧张嘛
Don't be so serious.

489
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:47,570
另外一个警察呢
Where's the other guy?

490
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,660
-嘿  朋友    -嘿  伙计
- Hey, friend.   - Hey, buddy!

491
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,660
-我想你了    -真的吗
- I missed you.   - Aw, did you really?

492
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,410
我给你展示过我的宝物收藏吗
Have I ever shown you my relic collection?

493
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,830
没有
Nope. I don't think you have.

494
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,660
没人知道这些东西哪来的
Nobody knows where this stuff comes from.

495
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:57,790
这一件
This one...

496
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,500
是一个创口贴
...is the Cloak of Ban Da'ld.

497
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,080
我听说想要将它从身上撕下来是很痛苦的
I hear it's super painful to take off.

498
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,880
-你要试试吗？    -这个...
- You wanna try it on?   - Well, um--

499
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,590
不用的  但是谢谢你
No, but thank you.

500
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,340
坏警察  过去几年我们一起做了很多了不起的事情
We've done some great work over the years together, Bad Cop...

501
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,470
抓捕这些建筑大师
...capturing all those MasterBuilders...

502
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,340
折磨他们  等等
...and torturing them and whatnot.

503
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,300
多谢  长官
Thank you, sir.

504
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,600
但是
Although...

505
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,180
你确实让反抗法宝被带走了
...you did let the Piece of Resistance go.

506
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,060
唯一一件可能会毁了我计划的东西
The one thing that can ruin my plans.

507
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,560
唯一一件我让你多加注意的东西
The one thing that I asked you to take care of.

508
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,860
这让我很是懊恼
That's super frustrating.

509
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,820
让我想要随便抓起任何一个
It makes me just wanna pick up whoever...

510
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,860
离我近的人
...is standing closest to me...

511
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,820
然后把他从这个窗户扔出去
...and throw them through this window...

512
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:32,740
丢进无尽深渊之中
...and out into the infinite abyss of nothingness!

513
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,660
我特别想这么做
I wanna do it so bad.

514
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,960
长官  我知道你想这么做  但我请求你不要
I know you do, sir. Please don't.

515
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,500
坏警察  不只是你一个人不断破坏我的计划
And it's not just you, Bad Cop, that keeps messing up my plans.

516
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,380
到处都有人在反抗我
People everywhere are always messing with my stuff.

517
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,470
但我有自己的解决方式
But I have a way to fix that.

518
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,140
一个让事情不超出我控制方式
A way to keep things exactly the way they are supposed to be.

519
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,470
永远的保持
Permanently.

520
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,310
看好了
Behold...

521
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,480
所有宝物中
...the most powerful weapon...

522
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,230
最强大的武器
...of all the relics:

523
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,690
克拉格
The Kragle!

524
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,160
正如你所见到的  他们正在把克拉格装到一个巨型机器中
As you can see, they're loading the Kragle in a big machine upstairs.

525
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,200
我把它称作
I call it...

526
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,950
克拉格触手喷射器
...the Tentacle Arm Kragle Outside Sprayer.

527
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,500
或者是TAKOS
Or TAKOS.

528
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,960
S代表的是寂静
The "S" is silent.

529
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,540
所以在墨西哥卷饼星期二的时候
So on Taco Tuesday...

530
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,960
它将会把克拉格喷射向所有人和物
...it's going to spray the Kragle over everyone and everything...

531
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:28,590
通过像这个一样的超级喷嘴
...with a bunch of super-scary nozzles like this one!

532
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,800
-我来给你演示下它是怎么工作的    -长官  我看这就不必了吧
- I'll show you how it works.   - Sir, I don't know if this is necessary.

533
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:34,260
哦  不要担心  我不会在你身上做实验的
Oh, don't worry. I won't test it on you.

534
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:36,010
我会拿你父母来试验
I'll do it on your parents!

535
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,180
什么？
What?

536
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,890
-嗨  儿子    -嗨
- Hi, son.   - Hi!

537
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,640
你在这座大城市过得怎么样
How's it going in the big city?

538
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:44,020
妈妈  爸爸  你们来这干嘛啊
Mommy. Daddy. What are you doing here?

539
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,690
好的  爸爸  我只要你像平时一样就可以了
Okay, Pa. I just want you to act naturally.

540
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,980
-就像你平时在家里一样    -好的
- Like you're going about your day.   - Gotcha.

541
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,690
对  把你的手就像这样举起来
Yeah. Keep your hand up like that.

542
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,780
妈妈
Ma, scoot...

543
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,700
往你右边走两步
...two steps in to the right.

544
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,870
爸爸  每次我和妈妈说话的时候
Pa, whenever I talk to Ma...

545
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,240
-你就得开始动起来    -对不起  先生
-...you start to move.   - Sorry, sir.

546
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:58,660
退回你原来的位置
Get back to where you were!

547
00:24:58,910 --> 00:24:59,620
-这里？    -对
- Here?   - Perfect.

548
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:02,250
太好了  你做的非常好  你没事就别动了
That's great. You can't do anything better. No reason why you should move.

549
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,000
好的
Right.

550
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:03,750
现在  妈妈
Now, Ma...

551
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,500
把你的手放到他的肩上   然后你
...hand on his shoulder. And you--

552
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,090
爸爸  你刚刚又动了  都被你给毁了
Pa, you just moved and you've just wrecked it!

553
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,000
你毁了这个游戏
You wrecked it!

554
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,420
坏警察  你明白我的要求是什么了吗
Bad Cop, you see what I'm talking about?

555
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:15,430
我要求的是绝对的完美
All I'm asking for is total perfection.

556
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,100
叫机器经理进来
Send in a Micro-manager!

557
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,390
自动造型程序启动
Commencing micro-management.

558
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:25,560
你们站着别动
Hold still, you guys.

559
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:29,570
然后
And then...

560
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,070
我只需要用TAKOS喷射器
...I just spray them...

561
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,530
把克拉格喷射出来
...With the TAKOS.

562
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,450
哦  孩子他爸  抓紧我
Oh, Pa, hold me.

563
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,780
哦  亲爱的  我的腿动不了
Oh, darling, I can't move me legs.

564
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,040
坏警察  这让你很心烦吗？
Does that upset you, Bad Cop?

565
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,540
你肯定为你父母感到难过  你想要帮他们  对吧？
Surely you feel bad for your parents, and you wanna help them, don't you?

566
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:48,590
儿子  我们没事  只是有点卡住了
We're okay, son. Just a little stuck, is all.

567
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,420
继续
Go ahead...

568
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,670
完成工作
...finish the job.

569
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,220
没问题  长官
Of course, sir.

570
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,550
不  我不想做
No, I don't want to.

571
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,300
-你必须去做    -我不想做
- You have to.   - I don't want to.

572
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,060
-你就不能安静点吗    -我做不到
- Would you please be quiet?   - I can't.

573
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,430
-你必须这么做  闭嘴    -但是他们
- You must. Shut it!    - But they--

574
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,640
-这样做不好    -这是你的工作
-It's not nice.   -It's your job, man.

575
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,020
我不能这么做
I can't do it.

576
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,850
-他们是无辜的    -和我想的一样
- They're innocent.   - Just as I thought.

577
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,860
坏警察  你好警察的一面让你变得心软了
Your Good Cop side's making you soft, Bad Cop.

578
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:10,770
小的们
Robots!

579
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,400
给我把棉签
Bring me the fleece-crested Scepter of Q-Teep...

580
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,570
和清洁剂拿过来
...and the Pé-Lish Remover of Na-ll.

581
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,070
你已经让救世主跑过一次了
You've already let The Special get away once.

582
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:18,910
长官
Sir.

583
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,200
我现在必须确保同样的事情不会再发生
I'm just gonna make sure it doesn't happen again.

584
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:23,620
好警察  你从此消失吧
No more Mr. Nice Guy!

585
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,880
不  我的儿子
Oh, son!

586
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,840
在墨西哥卷饼星期二  我将把整个宇宙都粘住
On Taco Tuesday, I'm going to Kragleize the entire universe...

587
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:37,130
这样大家就会停止对我的反叛
...so that everyone will stop messing with my stuff!

588
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,010
你是选择和我一起
Are you gonna be with me...

589
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,720
还是和你父母一起
...or are you gonna be stuck...

590
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,890
粘在这里喝茶聊天
...having a tea party with your mom and dad?

591
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:44,930
儿子
Son?

592
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,270
对不起了  爸爸
Sorry, Dad.

593
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,310
我还有工作去做
I have a job to do.

594
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,290
你只需要融入这里
All you have to do is blend in and act like you belong here.

595
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,540
太好了
Ah, perfect.

596
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:14,170
你好  我是个牛仔
Well, hi there, I'm a cowboy!

597
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,510
啪  啪  啪...
Bang, bang, bang-bang-bang-bang!

598
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,630
射  射  射  子弹  子弹  枪
Shoot, shoot, shoot. Bullet, bullet, gun.

599
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,930
咝  咝  咝
Zap, zap, zap, pow. Zap, pow.

600
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:19,930
{\an8}胡言乱语中

601
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,260
-他们在看什么    -我之前说错了
- What are they looking at?   - I made a mistake.

602
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,930
你应该站着别动  就像个板凳似的
You should just be still. Act like a stool.

603
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,350
-等等    -你们好  各位
- Wait!   - Howdy, guys!

604
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,520
-安静  板凳是不会说话的    -来做到我身上
- Quiet. Nope, stools don't talk.   - Come sit on me.

605
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,020
好了  安静
Okay, shh.

606
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,770
让我来示范一遍给你看
Let me show you how it's done.

607
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,070
多好的以为女士啊
What a lady!

608
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,160
好了  我们去找到找到巫师
Okay, let me just find the wizard...

609
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,200
然后解决了这件事
...and get this over with.

610
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,670
他在这儿
There he is.

611
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,710
-维特鲁威    -谁？
- Vitruvius.   - Who?

612
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,460
我从没听说过这个人  我也不是这个人
I've never heard of that man, whom I am not.

613
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,340
-你是哪位？    -是我啊
- Who are you?   -It's me.

614
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:00,180
我是一个看不见的盲人
I am a blind man and cannot see.

615
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,430
我是温斯黛
It's Wyldstyle.

616
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,640
你是一个DJ吗
Are you a DJ?

617
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,680
-什么？  为什么每个人都...    -等等
- What? Why does everybody--?   - Oh, wait, wait.

618
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,310
你是我过去那个缺乏安全感
Are you the student I used to have...

619
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,270
经常换名字的学生吗
...who was so insecure she kept changing her name?

620
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,100
不  不  我不是
No, no, no.

621
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,730
-先是暗黑风暴  接着又换成杰米尼兹    -我从来没有做个这种事
- First Darkstorm, then Geminizzle.   - No. Never.

622
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,900
然后是永不微笑  畸形脸  时髦裤衩
Then Neversmile, then Freakface, then Snazzypants.

623
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,060
好吧  我承认  我是的
Okay. All right, yes.

624
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,190
10秒后在楼上和我会面
Meet me upstairs in 10 seconds.

625
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:21,190
10秒后

626
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,790
哦  天呐
Oh, man.

627
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,080
你有个非常奇怪的
You have a very weirdly...

628
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:30,960
-装饰屋    -多谢夸奖
-...decorated place.   - Thank you.

629
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:34,380
维特鲁威  我们找到反抗法宝了
Vitruvius, we have found the Piece of Resistance.

630
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,210
-这是真的吗    -是的  但是
- Is it true?   - Yes, but--

631
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,590
温斯黛  预言说
Wyldstyle. The prophecy states that...

632
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,510
你就是救世主
...you are The Special.

633
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,130
善良的化身  恶魔的克星
The embodiment of good, foiler of evil.

634
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,300
这个世界上最具天赋  最才华横溢
The most talented, most brilliant...

635
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:48,390
以及最重要的人
...most important person in the universe.

636
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,590
如果是那样就太好了
That would be great...

637
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,310
但是埃米特才是那个找到反抗法宝的人
...but Emmet is the one who found the Piece.

638
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,400
哦  好的  埃米特
Oh, okay. Emmet!

639
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,860
预言说
The prophecy states that...

640
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,730
你就是救世主
...you are The Special.

641
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,440
-最具天赋    -我不确定他是不是救世主
- The most talented--   - I'm not sure he's The Special.

642
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:03,200
因为他连建筑大师都不是  看着
Because he's not even a MasterBuilder. Watch.

643
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,950
埃米特  利用你周围的这些东西
Emmet, just given what's around you...

644
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,120
-造些简单的东西出来    -好的
-...build something simple.   - Okay.

645
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,280
-比如一辆和酷的跑车    -好的
- Like an awesome race car.   - Great.

646
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:09,040
-开始吧    -你有建筑指南吗
- Go.    - Do you have the instructions?

647
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:12,710
不  我的君主  你必须在你的大脑中自己创建规则
No. You must create the instructions in your mind, my liege.

648
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,290
哦  好的  跑车啊
Ah. Okay. Race car.

649
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:19,300
这里真的有好多很酷的东西
Well, there's a lot of really cool stuff here.

650
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,420
没有看到车轮
Don't see a wheel...

651
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,340
或者
...Or...

652
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,970
多三个轮子
...three more wheels.

653
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,930
看到没  他做不了  他永远也成不了建筑大师
See? He can't do it. He will never be a MasterBuilder.

654
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,480
如果你一直告诉他他做不了  他当然不行
Of course not. Not if you keep telling him he can't.

655
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:37,230
他必须明白他能做到
He needs to see that he can.

656
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,400
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

657
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,440
-我们要进入你的脑海    -什么
- We are entering your mind...   - What?

658
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,740
去证明你拥有着尚未发掘的潜力
...to prove that you have the unlocked potential...

659
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,400
让你成为一个建筑大师
...to be a MasterBuilder.

660
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,910
酷  我们现在是在我大脑中吗
Whoa, are we inside my brain right now?

661
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,830
真大  我肯定很聪明
It's big. I must be smart.

662
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,830
{\an8}因为有人认为脑袋大的就聪明

663
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,750
这里面好像没有什么活力
I'm not hearing a lot of activity here.

664
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,510
我认为他从来没有过自己独到的思想
I don't think he's ever had an original thought. In his life.

665
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,720
哈哈  这你就说错了
Ha, ha. That's not true.

666
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,800
比如说  我有一次想要
For instance, one time I wanted to have...

667
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:08,010
一群朋友来我这看电视
...a bunch of my friends over to watch TV--

668
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:11,680
但不是这个像魔法一样突然出现的电视
Not unlike this TV that just showed up magically.

669
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:13,770
我的沙发容不下这么多人
And not everybody can fit on my one couch...

670
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,060
然后我就想
...and I thought to myself:

671
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:17,060
"如果能有个东西像双层床一样拥有两层
"What if there was such a thing as a bunk bed...

672
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,440
但是仍然是个沙发"
...but as a couch?"

673
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,980
像你们隆重介绍双层沙发
Introducing the double-decker couch.

674
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:24,070
因此所有的好朋友都可以一起看电视
So everyone could watch TV together and be buddies!

675
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,950
这简直是我听说过的最蠢的事情了
That is literally the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

676
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,530
别说了  温斯黛  让我来
Please, Wyldstyle, let me handle this.

677
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:32,620
这个想法真是太差了
That idea is just the worst.

678
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,580
这附近肯定有些东西
There must be something around here...

679
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,000
可以证明他的潜力
...that proves his potential.

680
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,670
如果上帝选中他作为救世主
If The Man Upstairs chose him to be The Special...

681
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,040
肯定是有原因的
...there must be a reason.

682
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,540
-谁是上帝？    -听到没？
- Who's The Man Upstairs?   - See?

683
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,300
他甚至不知道上帝
He doesn't even know about The Man Upstairs.

684
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,920
他是不是有一双特别粗野的手
Does he have, like, super-gross hands...

685
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:47,130
看上去就像是粉红色香肠做的
...that look like they're made out of big pink sausages?

686
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,390
像鹰的爪子和鱿鱼的混合吗?
Like eagle talons mixed with squid?

687
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,180
等等  你见过...
Wait. You've seen the--?

688
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,730
那是我刚刚在想的东西
That's what I was just thinking about.

689
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:56,640
你怎么...
How did you--?

690
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,020
当我触摸到法宝的时候  我就有了这个奇怪的梦
I had this weird dream when I touched the Piece.

691
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,270
好吧  其实我没睡着  所以这也称不上是个梦
Well, I mean, I wasn't asleep, so it wasn't really a dream.

692
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,570
埃米特  你梦见上帝了
Emmet, you had a vision.

693
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,610
真的吗
I did?

694
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,320
建筑大师们花费多年的时间
MasterBuilders spend years...

695
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:07,360
去训练自己来清空他们的大脑
...training themselves to clear their minds enough...

696
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:10,870
只为了拥有一睹上帝真容的机会
...to have even a fleeting glimpse of The Man Upstairs...

697
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,790
然而  你的大脑本身就是空的
...and yet, your mind is already so prodigiously empty...

698
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,040
压根就没什么需要清除的东西
...that there is nothing in it to clear away in the first place.

699
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,370
只要有正确的训练
With proper training...

700
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,040
你就能成为一个伟大的建筑大师
...you could become a great MasterBuilder.

701
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,210
我可以吗？
I could?

702
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,710
埃米特  预言选中了你
The prophecy chose you, Emmet.

703
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,920
但我并没有拥有做不了任何预言中
But I can't do any of the stuff...

704
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:29,930
说我拥有的能力
...that the prophecy says I'm supposed to do.

705
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:33,760
你只需要相信自己
All you have to do is to believe.

706
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:34,680
然后
Then...

707
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,600
你就可以洞穿万物
...you will see everything.

708
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,850
你准备好了吗  我的孩子
Are you ready, my son?

709
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,650
我准备好了
Yes, I am.

710
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,730
我觉得
I think.

711
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,780
那我们就没有时间去浪费了
Then we haven't a moment to lose.

712
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,490
我们必须召集
We must assemble...

713
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,490
建筑大师们
...the MasterBuilders.

714
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,160
你觉得飞船是个不好的发明吗
Do you think Zeppelins are a bad investment?

715
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:09,840
你们中有人见过这个人吗
Any of you fellas seen this guy?

716
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,800
等等  伙伴
Wait a minute, partner.

717
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,720
在他头上画个牛仔帽
Draw a cowboy hat on him.

718
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,360
这些机械鸟会把我们的消息送出去
These mechanical birds will get our message out.

719
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,110
他们会去网络咖啡屋
They will go to an Internet cafe...

720
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,860
然后给剩余的建筑大师发邮件
...and e-mail the remaining MasterBuilders...

721
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:31,150
然后他们会和我们在秘密的领域梦幻之境中会和
...who will meet us in the secret realm of Cloud Cuckooland.

722
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,990
梦幻之境？  等等  那之前说的训练呢
Cuckooland? Wait. What happened to that whole training part?

723
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,830
别担心  埃米特
Don't worry, Emmet.

724
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,740
你的训练现在就开始
Your training begins now.

725
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,040
钢琴师
Piano man...

726
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,040
快开门
open up-

727
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,750
你的训练晚点开始
Your training begins later!

728
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,960
倒数三下
On three.

729
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:46,960
1
One--

730
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,390
-我觉得我们安全了    -别动  暴徒们
- Whew. I think we're in the clear.   - Freeze, turkeys.

731
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,350
我只想要反抗法宝
All I want is the Piece of Resistance.

732
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,680
我们宁愿他死了也不会给你的
We would rather he died than give it to you.

733
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:04,230
我不会想要他死的
I would not rather he died.

734
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,400
听着  各位  我们可以心平气和的解决这件事  或者我们...
Look, everybody, we can do this the easy way, or we can do it--

735
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:08,320
快跑
Go, run!

736
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,940
看来他们选择了暴力的方式  开火
They took the hard way. Fire!

737
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,190
开火
Fire!

738
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,160
维特鲁威  去梦幻之镜该往哪走
Vitruvius, which way to Cloud Cuckooland?

739
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,200
朝着空中又大又亮的东西走
Head for the big bright thing in the sky.

740
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:18,280
-你是指太阳？    -是的  就是它
- You mean the sun?   - Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

741
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,700
让我们离开这里  用这个
Let's get out of here. Here, use this.

742
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:20,870
什么？  等等
What? Wait, hey--

743
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,830
-你在干嘛呢？    -出发
- What are you doing? Aah!   - Let's go!

744
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:26,040
我不知道我到底在干吗
I don't know what I'm doing.

745
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,300
再见
Good bye.

746
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,670
嘭
Boom!

747
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,260
哦  不
Oh, dang!

748
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,350
我被猪围住了  我讨厌猪
Aah! I've got pigs! I hate pigs!

749
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,270
不要在这里胡来了  我需要你帮忙
Quit playing around in the mud. I could use your help.

750
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,400
温斯黛  我们真的需要
Wyldstyle, we could really use...

751
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:50,230
你帮忙
...your help!

752
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,510
维特鲁威  他们追上来了  快做点什么
Vitruvius, they're gaining on us. Build something!

753
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,720
让埃米特试试
Let Emmet try!

754
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:16,510
不要  我们还是别让埃米特试了  我还没有接受过任何训练呢
No, let's not let Emmet try! I haven't had any training.

755
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,340
没事的
That's okay.

756
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,600
我们就从怎么成为建筑大师开始
We'll start with how to become a MasterBuilder.

757
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:22,390
第1步：相信你的直觉
Step one: Trust your instincts.

758
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,430
好吧  好吧
Okay, okay. Um--

759
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,100
造出点什么  造出点什么东西啊
Build something! Build something!

760
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:26,520
尝尝这个
Aha. Take that!

761
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,570
除非你的直觉很糟糕
Unless your instincts are terrible.

762
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:40,740
不  车轮
No! The wheel!

763
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,290
我支持不了太久了
I can't control it much longer!

764
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:51,630
埃米特  我们需要把轮子加到能旋转的东西上
Emmet, we need to attach the wheel to something that spins around.

765
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,710
我们需要把轮子加到能旋转的东西上
We need to attach the wheel to something that spins around.

766
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,760
我们需要把轮子加到能旋转的东西上
We need to attach the wheel to something that spins around.

767
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:59,510
我们需要把轮子加到能旋转的东西上
We need to attach the wheel to something that spins around.

768
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,600
能旋转的东西  旋转  旋转
Something that spins around. Spins around. Spins around.

769
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,310
知道了
Oh.

770
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,640
埃米特  你要去哪
Emmet, where are you going?

771
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,270
这最好能成
Oh, this better work.

772
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,820
抓紧了
Hang tight!

773
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,530
救命啊
Dagnabit!

774
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:19,700
干得好  埃米特
Well done, Emmet.

775
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:21,660
嘿  我成功了
Hey! I did it.

776
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,990
你真的做到了
Wow. You actually did it.

777
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,210
火车
Train!

778
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,050
哦  不
Oh, no.

779
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,840
从我的火车上下去
Get off my train.

780
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:39,050
快跑
Run!

781
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,220
温斯黛
Wyldstyle!

782
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,690
好痛
Owie!

783
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,060
他要撞到我们了
He's gonna ram us.

784
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,360
快  快  快  那一块  给我那个积木
Quick, quick, quick! That piece! Give me that piece.

785
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,860
嗯？
Huh?

786
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,610
建个斜坡
Build a ramp!

787
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:03,910
搞什么鬼
What the heck?

788
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,740
去死吧
Rest in pieces.

789
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:08,660
哦  不
Oh, no.

790
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:09,870
等等  不  不  不
Wait. No, no, no.

791
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,260
嘿
Hey

792
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,550
多谢你刚才救了我
Thanks for saving my life back there.

793
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,180
虽然  你知道的
Even if, you know...

794
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:26,560
最终被证明那是毫无意义的
...eventually it turned out to be pointless.

795
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,520
无论如何
Well, for what it's worth...

796
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,850
这都将是我生命中最精彩的15分钟
...this has been about the greatest 15 minutes of my life.

797
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,360
怎么...
What the--?

798
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,240
各位  放轻松  我在这呢
Relax, everybody, I'm here.

799
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:46,120
蝙蝠侠
Batman!

800
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,490
-你好啊  亲爱的    -亲爱的
- What's up, babe?   - Babe!

801
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,540
-什么？    -哦  对不起  蝙蝠侠  这是埃米特
- What?   - Oh, sorry. Batman, this is Emmet.

802
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,870
埃米特  这是我的男朋友蝙蝠侠
Emmet, this is my boyfriend, Batman.

803
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,580
我是蝙蝠侠
I'm Batman.

804
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:56,540
这是你男朋友？
That's your boyfriend?

805
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,210
蝙蝠侠  你们在哪认识的
Batman, huh? Where'd you guys meet?

806
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,840
那是个很有趣的故事  对吧  小蝙蝠
It's actually a funny story, right, Bat?

807
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,050
在那呢
There he is.

808
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,390
-很高心见到你  坏警察    -蝙蝠侠
-"Police" to meet you, Bad Cop.   - Batman!

809
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,310
这真是
The pleasure...

810
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,350
荣幸之至
...is all "spine."

811
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,640
你知道吗
Guess what...

812
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:10,730
你这个大傻瓜
...you big dumb baby.

813
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,310
你的车就跟婴儿车似的
Your car is a baby carriage.

814
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:16,230
哦  不  你的男朋友不见了
Oh, no, your boyfriend's gone.

815
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,520
-嘿  亲爱的    -什么？
- Hey, babe.   - What?

816
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:18,770
让我们手牵手
Let's hold hands.

817
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,070
额
So, uh...

818
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,570
嘿  各位  我觉得我们要撞进太阳了
Hey, guys, I think we're about to crash into the sun.

819
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,910
是的  这将会变的很酷的
Yeah, but it's gonna look really cool.

820
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,630
这就是梦幻之境吗  我没有看到什么云彩
Uh, is this Cloud Cuckooland? I don't see any clouds.

821
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,590
-或者杜鹃鸟啊    -不  不  这是
- Or cuckoos.   - No, no, this is...

822
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,630
新西兰中部
...Middle Zealand.

823
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,170
{\an8}新西兰中部

824
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,170
一个奇妙的大陆
A wondrous land...

825
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,840
这里充满了骑士  城堡  羊肉
...full of knights, castles, mutton...

826
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:45,340
刑具  贫困、水蛭、文盲
...torture weapons, poverty, leeches, illiteracy...

827
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,970
还有
...and, um...

828
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,260
龙
Dragon!

829
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,100
对  也有龙
Yeah, that too.

830
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:56,350
一旦我们到达梦幻之境  我们将会组织起
Once we arrive at Cloud Cuckooland, we'll raise an army...

831
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,270
一只建筑大师的军队
...of MasterBuilders to--

832
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,650
无论如何  你们一定得看看我新安装的低音喇叭
Anyway, you guys gotta check out these new subwoofers I installed.

833
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,900
我把它们叫做野狗  听他们狂吠吧
I call them the dogs. Listen to them bark!

834
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,820
你能把这声音调低点吗
Can you turn that down a little bit?

835
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:08,660
这首歌是我写给温斯黛的
This is a song I wrote for Wyldstyle.

836
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,280
黑暗
Darkness

837
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:11,950
这是一首关于我是个孤儿的歌
It's about how I'm an orphan.

838
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,700
无父无母
No parents

839
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,460
这才是真正的音乐 埃米特
This is real music, Emmet.

840
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,330
蝙蝠侠是个真正的艺术家  黑暗  沉思
Batman's a true artist. Dark, brooding.

841
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,540
我也会黑暗和沉思啊
Well, I'm dark and brooding too.

842
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,670
各位  快看  有彩虹
Guys, look, a rainbow.

843
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,470
所以你会开上彩虹
So you're gonna drive up the curved part...

844
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,420
超级富豪
Super rich

845
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,550
沿着彩虹直到最高点
...take it all the way to the top...

846
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:28,590
让他变得更好
Kind of makes it better

847
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,100
然后把车停在那
...and park the car.

848
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:34,140
朋友们  欢迎来到梦幻之境  现在
Friends, welcome to Cloud Cuckooland. Now...

849
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,810
我只需要打开秘密大门
I just need to give the secret knock.

850
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,870
好吧
Okay

851
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,040
我只是跟你们来了
I'm just gonna come right out.

852
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:04,090
但我完全不知道到底发生了什么  或者这是什么地方
I have no idea what's going on, or what this place is at all.

853
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:07,550
嗨  我是独角猫公主
Hi! I am Princess Unikitty...

854
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,050
欢迎你们来到梦幻之境
...and I welcome you all to Cloud Cuckooland.

855
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:15,600
事先根本毫无征兆
There's no signs or anything.

856
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:17,770
你们怎么知道什么不该做
How does anyone know what not to do?

857
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,230
这就是梦幻之境
Here in Cloud Cuckooland...

858
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,560
这里没有规则
...there are no rules.

859
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,190
没有政府
There's no government...

860
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,770
没有保姆
...no babysitters...

861
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,190
没有就寝时间
...no bedtimes...

862
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,990
没有忧郁的脸庞
...no frowny faces...

863
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,070
没有不修边幅的人
...no bushy mustaches...

864
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,530
也没有任何消极情绪
...and no negativity of any kind.

865
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,660
你刚都说了上千遍"没有"了
You just said the word "no" like a thousand times.

866
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:36,160
也不需要前后如一
And there's also no consistency.

867
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,210
我讨厌这个地方
I hate this place.

868
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,330
任何主意都是好的
Any idea is a good idea...

869
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,210
除了不高兴的主意
...except the not happy ones.

870
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,340
那些你深埋心底的主意
Those you push down deep inside...

871
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,800
你永远  永远  永远
...where you'll never, ever, ever...

872
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:47,630
永远
...ever...

873
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,590
也不会找到它们
...find them.

874
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,220
你们的建筑大师已经在汪星人大厅集结了
Your fellow MasterBuilders are gathered in the Dog.

875
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:53,600
什么？
The what?

876
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,890
呃  那是超人吗
Ah! Is that Superman?

877
00:39:59,230 --> 00:39:59,890
姑娘  在做什么呢
Girl, what are you doing?

878
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,980
-嘿  超人    -哦  嘿  怎么了
- Hey, Superman!   - Oh, hey. What's up?

00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:04,070
-我是绿灯侠    -我知道了
- Lantern. Green Lantern.   - Yeah, yeah.

880
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,820
开会的时候想坐在一起吗
You wanna sit together at the meeting?

881
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,610
额  我必须回氪星去
Um, I have to go back to Krypton.

882
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,900
氪星不是已经毁了吗
Didn't Krypton blow up?

883
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:13,320
我的建筑大师们  包括但不限于以下几位：

890
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:25,540
你们从大老远跑来  只为了这历史性的一刻
You have traveled far to be here for a moment of great import.

891
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,710
我们已经获悉
We have learned...

892
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,880
邪恶暴君打算启用
...that Lord Business plans to unleash...

893
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,720
完全状态的克拉格
...a fully weaponized Kragle...

894
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,430
在墨西哥卷饼星期二那天
...on Taco Tuesday...

895
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,050
来毁灭这个世界  正如大家以前所了解的一样

896
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,430

902
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,610
我们还有希望
There is yet one hope.

903
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,730
救世主已经诞生
The Special has arisen.

904
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:50,240
让这个年轻人上前来
Have the young man step forward.

905
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:51,490
如你所愿  大布利多
As you wish, Dubbledore.

906
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,190
{\an8}邓布利多：哈利波特中霍格沃茨魔法学校校长  也是个巫师

907
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,450
我是甘道夫
I'm Gandalf!

908
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,740
-那应该读成邓布利多    -大布利多
-It's pronounced "Dumbledore."   - Dubbadore?

909
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:56,240
不是  是邓布利多
No, "Dumbledore."

910
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:57,200
你不就是说"大布利多"吗
Thought you said "Dubbadore."

911
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:58,040
维特鲁威

你得把你名字写下来  因为我是没打算去记它的
You gotta write that down. I'm not gonna remember any of it.

913
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:01,960
好了  我们开始吧
But here we go.

914
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:07,170
现在救世主要给大家做个演讲
The Special will now give an eloquent speech.

915
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,050
上来吧  你能行的

916
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,850
好吧
Okay

Oh, and this is the Piece of Resistance.

919
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,580
多谢
Thank you.

920

922
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,580
进入奥坦塔  找到克拉格
...to get into the Octan Tower, find the Kragle...

923
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:47,840
然后把这反抗法宝放到克拉格上
...and put this thing on the thing.

924
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:50,590
我知道这会是十分艰难的  但是
And I know it's going to be really hard, but--

925
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,090
十分艰难？
"Really hard"?

926
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:56,800
用你的钩子手来擦屁股才叫困难
Wiping ye burn with a hook for a hand is really hard.

927
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:58,720
这是完全不可能
This be impossible.

928
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:01,810
上次我们尝试攻击邪恶暴君办公室时
The last time we tried to storm Lord Business' office...

929
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,230
我们用了所有我们能设想到的计划
...we used every plan we could conceive.

930
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,730
但结果却是令人难以启齿的惨败
The result was a massacre too terrible to speak of.

931
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:09,110
你是哪位？
Who are you?

932
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,440
我叫金属胡子
The name be Metal Beard.

933
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:14,200
而且我会告诉你我的苦衷
And I'll tell you me tale of woe.

934
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:16,070
这下好了  他又来说了
Oh, great, here we go again.

935
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:16,950
我来到
I arrived...

936
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,370
奥坦塔的脚下
...at the foot of the Tower...

937
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,290
和我齐心协力的建筑大师们
...with me hearty MasterBuilder crew...

938
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:25,540
却发现克拉格在塔的最高层
...only to find the Kragle was all the way up on the infinityeth floor...

939
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:28,130
被一群机器人军队保卫着
guarded by a robot army...

940
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,340
而且安保措施考虑了
...and security measures...

941
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:30,790
各种可能发生的
...of every kind...

942
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:32,170
进攻方式
...imaginable:

943
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,460
激光
Lasers...

944
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,550
鲨鱼
...sharks...

945
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,760
武装了激光的鲨鱼
...laser sharks...

946
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:39,510
傲慢的助理
...overbearing assistants...

947
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,850
还有各种奇怪、危险的法宝
...and strange, dangerous relics...

948
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:43,890
比如创口贴
...that entrap...

949
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:44,730
订书机
II-Snap...

950
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:45,940
还有电池
...and zap.

951
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:50,110
还有个叫做思维牢笼的神秘房间
And there be a mysterious room called the Think Tank.

952
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,570
我想尽了各种办法才
I barely made it out of that...

953
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,440
从把我的头颅
...room...

954
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:54,570
和各种器官
...with just me head!

955
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:58,740
那个房间逃出来
And organs.

956
00:42:58,990 --> 00:42:59,660
好吧
Okay

957
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,660
我不得不换掉身体的每一部分
I had to replace every part of my once-strapping...

958
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:04,330
来造就我这气概十足的海盗身材
...virile pirate body...

959
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:08,120
用的就是你现在看到的这些垃圾
...with this useless hunk of garbage ye see before ye.

960
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:12,000
因此  如果你觉得回去那个被抛弃的奥坦塔
So if ye think it'd be a good idea to return...

961
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:13,300
是个好主意的话
...to that forsaken place...

962
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:14,630
救世主
...Special...

963
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,920
你能有什么比
...what idea have ye that be better...

964
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:18,720
这里的其他建筑大师们
...than the ideas of 100...

965
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:21,430
更好的方法呢
...of our fallen MasterBuilder brothers?

966
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:23,310
好吧
Well, uh...

967
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,430
严格说来  我还不是个建筑大师
Well, technically I'm not exactly a MasterBuilder yet.

968
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,600
什么？
What?

969
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:31,610
安静  各位  安静
Please! Everyone! Please!

970
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:33,270
垃圾
Rubbish!

971
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,150
是的  这是真的
Yes, it's true.

972
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,070
我或许不是个建筑大师
I may not be a MasterBuilder.

973
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,240
我或许没有太多的经验
I may not have a lot of experience...

974
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:43,620
来战斗、领导或着提出计划
...fighting or leading or coming up with plans.

975
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,160
或者给大家出主意
Or having ideas in general.

976
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,960
事实上  我没有那么聪明
In fact, I'm not all that smart.

977
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:53,840
而且我也不是你们说的"创造型"的
And I'm not what you'd call a "creative type."

978
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,550
另外
Plus...

979
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,880
我没有熟练的技能
...generally unskilled.

980
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,930
而且
Also...

981
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,850
非常胆小和懦弱
...scared and cowardly.

982
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:05,390
我知道你们在想什么
I know what you're thinking:

983
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:08,020
"他是这个世界上
"He is the least qualified person...

984
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,480
最没有资格领导我们的人"
...in the world to lead us."

985
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,900
你们是对的
And you are right.

986
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:16,110
你觉得这么说就能让我们好过些吗
This is supposed to make us feel better?

987
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,530
不  我还没有说完呢  接下来就该用"但是"转折了
No, there was about to be a "but."

988
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,610
-你就是个笑柄    -是的
- You're a butt!   - Yes.

989
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,610
{\an8}此处但是(but)与笑柄(butt)同音

990
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:23,070
你们只能靠自己了
You all be on your own!

991
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,830
我要退出这项注定要失败的事业
I be leaving this lost cause!

992
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,080
你为什么要离开
Why are you leaving?

993
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:32,250
一个充满分歧的房间
A house divided against itself would be better...

994
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,580
都要比这好
...than this.

995
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:35,130
亚伯拉罕·林肯
Abraham Lincoln!

996
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,300
把你的太空飞椅飞回来
You bring your space chair right back here!

997
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,170
别这样  各位
Come on, guys!

998
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:42,130
我们还是可以这么做的  对吗
We can still do this. Right?

999
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,010
你一点也不特殊
You're not even a bit special.

1000
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:46,810
你说得对  他确实是一事无成
Well, you were right about him being a ding-dong.

1001
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,640
你带给我们的只是失望而已
You're a huge disappointment.

1002
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:52,100
把他给我赶出去  我不想再看到他
Get him out of here. I don't wanna look at him.

1003
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:57,900
至少情况不会变得比这更坏了
Well, at least it can't get any worse.

1004
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:01,280
看来我错了
I was wrong.

1005
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:06,280
我们被入侵了
It's the Orb of Tee-ti-list!

1006
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:09,290
喔哦  坏人来了
Ruh-roh. It's the bad guys.

1007
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,330
喔哦  他怎么...
Whoa. How did he--?

1008
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:14,290
走  快跑  所有人保护救世主
Go! Run! Come on, everyone! Protect The Special.

1009
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:15,920
他踝关节上的东西是什么
What's that on his ankle?

1010
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:18,710
是一个跟踪装置
It's a tracking device.

1011
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,920
把建筑大师们抓到监狱去
Take the MasterBuilders prisoner.

1012
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:22,670
是他把入侵者引来的
Oh, he led them right to us.

1013
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:25,090
各位  不  不  不  这不是我的错
Guys, no, no, no. It's not my fault.

1014
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:28,430
你是我见过的最糟的领袖  快到蝙蝠战车上去
You are the worst leader I've ever seen. To the Batmobile!

1015
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:30,930
该死的
Dang it.

1016
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:32,180
去隐形战机那
To the invisible jet!

1017
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,980
-该死    -大家都自保吧
- Dang it!   - Every man for himself.

1018
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:38,020
不  我们必须保护反抗法宝
No, we must protect the Piece.

1019
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:39,650
沙克  知道现在是什么时辰吗？
Shaq, do you know what time...

1020
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:39,650
{\an8}沙克·奥尼尔：NBA球星  绰号鲨鱼

1021
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,780
-是？    -是游戏时间
-...it is?   -It's game time.

1022
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,660
你们都准备接招吧
Y'all ready for this?

1023
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,370
哦  不  他们是有备而来的
Oh, no! They were ready for that.

1024
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:51,250
它居然没坏
It didn't break!

1025
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,250
因为这是用克拉格粘起来的  机关枪
Because it's Kragled. Machine gum!

1026
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:55,710
开火
Fire!

1027
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:56,790
不
No!

1028
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,630
啊  我动不了了
Aah! I can't move!

1029
00:45:58,880 --> 00:45:59,590
别担心  超人
Don't worry, Superman.

1030
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,340
-我会把你救出来的    -不  不要
- I'll get you out of there.   - No! Don't!

1031
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:05,510
哦  我的天呐  我的手粘住了  我的脚也粘住了
Aah! Oh, my gosh. My hands are stuck. My legs are stuck as well.

1032
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,760
我恨死你了
I super hate you.

1033
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:10,350
-啊  你要把我拆散架了   -亲爱的
- Ow! You're pulling my torso off.   - Babe...

1034
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,470
快来帮我救他
...help me get him out of here.

1035
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,980
我说了"每个人自保"
I said "every man for himself."

1036
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,850
嘿  你得支持我
Hey, you gotta be there for me.

1037
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:19,770
好吧
Fine!

1038
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:21,530
好吧  好吧  好吧
Fine. Fine. Fine.

1039
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,650
-我需要你的态度好一点    -我有一个很好的
- I need you to have a better attitude.   - I have a great...

1040
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,530
-态度    -好痛
-...attitude.   - Ouch.

1041
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:27,410
{\an8}追踪中...

1042
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:27,410
救世主在西北方向
The Special's in the northwest quadrant.

1043
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,910
我们已经把他逼入绝境了
We've got him cornered.

1044
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:30,700
好痛  好痛  好痛
Ouch. Ouch. Ouch.

1045
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:31,870
他跑哪去了
Where'd he go?

1046
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:37,500
哦  不
Oh, no!

1047
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:39,500
他们击中我们的云稳定剂了
They've hit our silly cloud stabilizers!

1048
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:41,590
我们走  我们得把埃米特救出去
Let's go! We need to get Emmet out of here.

1049
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,840
-我们不能建些什么东西吗    -嘿  我是本  不过你可以叫我本尼
- Can't we build something?   - Hey! I'm Ben. But you can call me Benny.

1050
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:46,090
我可以建造宇宙飞船  看好了
I can build a spaceship. Watch.

1051
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:48,720
宇宙飞船  宇宙飞船  宇宙飞船...
Spaceship, spaceship, spaceship Spaceship, spaceship

1052
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:50,850
不  你不能见这个  空中被包围了
No! You can't. The skies are surrounded.

1053
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,140
没事的  反正我也没真想建
That's okay. I didn't really wanna build...

1054
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:54,640
一艘宇宙飞船  没事的
...a spaceship anyway. That's cool.

1055
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:56,390
我们要去哪才能不被发现
Where can we go where we can't be found?

1056
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,150
也许我们该到水下去
Maybe we could go underwater?

1057
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,020
要不我们去水底下吧
What if we went underwater?

1058
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:00,980
好主意  亲爱的
Great idea, babe!

1059
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:02,900
蝙蝠侠  多谢你  你的主意是最好的
Thank you, Batman. Your ideas are the best.

1060
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:03,860
但我刚刚也说了这个
But I just said that.

1061
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:07,070
-我们需要建一艘潜艇    -一艘蝙蝠潜艇
- We could build a submarine.   - A Bat-Submarine, patent pending.

1062
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,070
要有彩虹
With rainbows!

1063
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,200
还有睡袋，以防我们要打盹
And dream catchers, in case we take a nap.

1064
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:11,780
就像个水下的宇宙飞船
Like an underwater spaceship!

1065
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:13,410
但你不能一次性造这么多啊
But you can't build all of them at once.

1066
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,080
准备好了吗  开工
Ready? Break.

1067
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:15,950
好吧
Okay

1068
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:19,290
蓝盆子和酸苹果
Blue razzleberry and sour apple!

1069
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,380
如果任何人有黑色的部分  我需要它们  明白了吗
If anybody has black parts, I need them, okay?

1070
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:22,750
我工作的时候只穿黑色
I only work in black.

1071
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,010
偶尔也用非常深沉的灰色
And sometimes, very, very dark gray.

1072
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,420
-用些黄砖    -嘿  各位  我能帮帮吗
- Use the yellow bricks!   - Hey, guys, can I help?

1073
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:28,680
-不  必须这样    -不  我需要那个
- No! It has to be this way!   - No, I need that!

1074
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:29,640
他在哪
Where is he?

1075
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:32,050
有谁知道这是什么吗  还有你需要这个吗
Anyone know what this is, and do you need it?

1076
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:33,970
我觉得我们需要用到机翼和火箭推进器
I think we could use wings and rocket boosters.

1077
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:35,720
把你的东西从我的地盘拿出去
Ew. Get your retro space stuff out of my area.

1078
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:38,940
各位  告诉我到底该做什么  以及如何去做
You guys, hey, just tell me exactly what to do. And how to do it.

1079
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:42,360
埃米特  你不用管其他人在做什么
Emmet, don't worry about what the others are doing.

1080
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:46,490
你必须发掘你自己与众不同的地方
You must embrace what is special about you!

1081
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:55,870
他在那
There he is!

1082
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,080
所有人  攻击那艘潜艇
All units, attack the sub!

1083
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:03,880
埃米特  快进来
Emmet, get in here!

1084
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:11,550
拦住他  拦住他  不要让他
Stop him! Stop him! Don't let him...

1085
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:12,760
潜进水里
...get to the water!

1086
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:14,050
俯冲  俯冲  大家都进来
Dive, dive, dive! Everybody in!

1087
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,140
我们要下去了
We're going under!

1088
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:34,240
哦  不
Oh, no.

1089
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:55,800
我的家园
My home.

1090
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,470
都毁了
It's gone.

1091
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:05,560
我感觉自己体内
I feel something inside.

1092
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:07,820
有一股愤怒的情绪
It's like the opposite of happiness.

1093
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,570
我必须保持乐观
I must stay positive.

1094
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:15,370
泡泡糖
Ah. Bubble gums.

1095
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:18,160
蝴蝶
Butterflies.

1096
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,960
棉花糖
Cotton candy.

1097
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:27,880
天啊  我对不起你  独角猫
Gosh, I'm so sorry, Unikitty.

1098
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,130
你想坐下来谈谈吗
Do you want to sit down and talk about it?

1099
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:36,510
这鬼东西是什么
What the heck is that?

1100
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,510
这是张双层沙发
It's a double-decker couch.

1101
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,270
当时看起来是个很好的主意
Which seemed like a good idea at the time...

1102
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,850
但现在我意识到它并没什么用
...but I now realize it's not super helpful.

1103
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:46,650
但是  它有杯托
But, you know, it has cup holders.

1104
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,440
座椅下面还有冷却器
Seats flip up with coolers underneath.

1105
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:53,570
你还真是各方面都令人失望啊
You are so disappointing on so many levels.

1106
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:56,570
为什么我的裤子又冷又湿
Why are my pants cold and wet?

1107
00:49:59,240 --> 00:49:59,830
船体破洞
Hull breach.

1108
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,160
墙壁在哭泣
The walls are crying!

1109
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:03,500
潜艇的缝合处正在不断瓦解
We're coming apart at the seams!

1110
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:06,210
这不该是蝙蝠侠的死法
This is not how Batman dies.

1111
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:08,420
埃米特
Emmet!

1112
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:10,500
-抓紧了  抓紧了    -温斯黛
- Hold on, hold on!   - Wyldstyle!

1113
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:14,420
大家深呼吸
Deep breath! Deep breath, everybod--!

1114
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:35,320
机器经理们  下面发生什么事了
Micro-managers, what's going on down there?

1115
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:38,160
扫描海底残骸
Scanning submarine wreckage.

1116
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,330
没有发现幸存者
No survivors detected.

1117
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,580
能潜水的警察们  如果有必要就疏通整个海洋
Scuba cops, dredge the entire ocean if you have to.

1118
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:46,750
我们必须找到反抗法宝
We have got to find that Piece.

1119
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,960
让我们押送这些囚犯回去见商业之王
Let's get these prisoners back to Lord Business...

1120
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:50,460
然后把这个好消息带给他
...and give him the good news.

1121
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:53,420
救世主已经不复存在了
The Special is no more.

1122
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,090
大家好
Hello, everybody!

1123
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:02,220
超人  神奇女侠  真没想到你们也会在这
Superman. Wonder Woman, I had no idea you'd be here.

1124
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:03,770
沙奎尔·奥尼尔先生
Mr. Shaquille O'Neal.

1125
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:03,770
{\an8}沙奎尔·奥尼尔：美国篮球运动员

1126
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,850
大家好
Greetings, all!

1127
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:08,350
欢迎来到我的思想牢笼
Welcome to my Think Tank.

1128
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:10,690
救救我们
Help us!

1129
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,900
这些年你抓的建筑大师们
All the MasterBuilders you've captured over the years...

1130
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:14,030
你都把他们关在这
...you've brought them here.

1131
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,820
你是一个聪明人  超人
You're a very perceptive person, Superman.

1132
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:20,370
他们想出了宇宙中一切的指令
They come up with all the instructions for everything in the universe.

1133
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:21,620
小的们
Robots!

1134
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:24,160
不  不
No! No!

1135
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,960
再也找不到比这更糟的了
Can't get much worse than this.

1136
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:32,380
-你好  邻居    -哦  不
- Uh, hello, neighbor.   - Oh, no.

1137
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:33,550
我是绿灯侠
It's Green Lantern.

1138
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,880
哦  我的天呐  我们现在是室友了  真是太好了
Oh, my gosh, we're roommates! How crazy is that?

1139
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:39,760
有谁能够给我一些氪石吗
Does anyone have some Kryptonite that they could give me?

1140
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:43,350
等等  救世主哪去了
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where is The Special?

1141
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,520
救世主和反抗法宝沉入了海洋底下
The Special and the Piece of Resistance are at the bottom of the ocean.

1142
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,520
等等  你是和我说你没抓到他
Wait, are you telling me you don't have him?

1143
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:52,400
长官  在我们说话这会  我那些能潜水的手下正在找寻他们的残骸呢
Sir, my scuba team is looking for his remains as we speak.

1144
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:56,610
坏警察  他有可能还活着  法宝可能还在那
Bad Cop, he could still be alive! The Piece could still be out there.

1145
00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:00,320
那个救世主唯一剩余的作品只是张双层沙发
The only remnant of The Special was a double-decker couch.

1146
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:01,870
等等
Wait, hold on.

1147
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,990
你说一张双层沙发
A double-decker couch?

1148
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:04,790
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

1149
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,960
真的？  就是把上下铺变成了沙发？
Really? So it's like a bunk-bed couch? Is that what it's like?

1150
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:10,420
这还真是奇怪
That's weird.

1151
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:12,170
如果你坐在上层的中间
If you're sitting in the top middle...

1152
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,250
除非你从某人身上爬过  不然该怎么下来呢
...how are you gonna get down without climbing over someone?

1153
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,170
如果你坐在沙发的底层看电视
If you're sitting on the bottom and you're watching TV...

1154
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:20,050
那你不是还得看着上层摇晃的大腿？
...are you gonna have to watch through a bunch of dangling legs?

1155
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,050
这样还有谁愿意坐底层啊
Who's gonna want to sit on the bottom?

1156
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:23,550
这还真是
It is literally...

1157
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:27,810
我听说过的最没用的主意了
...the most useless idea I have ever heard.

1158
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:33,020
-看吧  你还活着    -是啊
- Well, we're still alive.   - Yeah!

1159
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:35,440
嘿  双层沙发
Heh. The double-decker couch.

1160
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:37,400
看来也不是完全没用嘛
It wasn't totally pointless after all.

1161
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:39,490
这是唯一一件没有毁了的东西
It's the one thing that stayed together.

1162
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,490
我一直都相信你  埃米特
I always believed in you, Emmet.

1163
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:44,530
我不是故意想要破坏气氛  但是是否有人注意到
I don't mean to spoil the party, but does anyone else notice...

1164
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:46,990
我们被困在海洋中了
...we're stuck in the middle of the ocean on this couch?

1165
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,120
我的意思是  又不会有巨大的船
I mean, it's not like a big gigantic ship...

1166
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:50,750
突然冒出来营救我们
...is gonna come out of nowhere and save us--

1167
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,080
我的天呐
My gosh!

1168
00:52:56,290 --> 00:52:58,260
快停下
Avast, mateys!

1169
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:08,220
金属胡子  我以为你说我们是注定要失败的呢
Metal Beard, I thought you said we were a lost cause!

1170
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:09,470
是啊
Ye are!

1171
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,600
你没有听完我的故事吗
Did ye not hear me whole story...

1172
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:15,060
关于这个愚蠢的行动
...circumscribing the folly of this whole enterprise?

1173
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:17,650
好吧  在你大喊大叫的时候  想不听都难
Well, it's kind of hard not to hear when you're yelling everything.

1174
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,320
你为什么又回来了
So why did you come back?

1175
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:21,950
这应该就是双层沙发了吧
This be-doubled land couch.

1176
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:26,870
我看到邪恶暴君的军队完全忽视了这个
I watched Lord Business' forces completely overlook it.

1177
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,240
这就意味着我们需要更多像这样看起来无用的主意
Which means we need more ideas like it!

1178
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:30,160
哦  多谢
Oh, thank you.

1179
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:32,330
我们需要那些主意又蠢又笨
Ideas so dumb and bad...

1180
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:36,460
以至于没人会想到这些有可能是有用的
...that no one would ever think they could possibly be useful.

1181
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:38,300
还是谢谢你
Oh. Thank you.

1182
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:41,090
那么  救世主  我们该怎么做
So, Special, what do we do?

1183
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:46,180
额
Uh...

1184
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:48,430
这样
Well...

1185
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:52,810
有什么事是邪恶暴君认为建筑大师们肯定不会做的
...what's the last thing Lord Business expects MasterBuilders will do?

1186
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:53,690
建造一艘宇宙飞船？
Build a spaceship?

1187
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:54,440
杀鸡吗？
Kill a chicken?

1188
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:55,520
嫁给棉花糖
Marry a marshmallow.

1189
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:56,350
什么  就像这样：
Why, this:

1190
00:53:56,610 --> 00:54:00,110
你要如何让他们在农场?
How you gonna keep 'em down on the farm?

1191
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,240
不  是遵守规则
No! It's follow the instructions.

1192
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:05,820
-不喜欢那个    -听起来怪怪的
- Don't like that.   - Sounds weird.

1193
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:07,990
不  听着  等等  你们听着
Now, listen. Wait, listen.

1194
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:13,910
各位  你们都富有天赋  拥有丰富的想象力
Guys, you're all so talented and imaginative.

1195
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:17,500
但你们却无法像个团队似的一起合作
But you can't work together as a team.

1196
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,630
我只是一个建筑工人
I'm just a construction worker.

1197
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,840
但当我有计划  而且大家一起合作的时候
But when I had a plan and we were all working together...

1198
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:26,640
我们就可以建造一栋摩天大楼
...I mean, we could build a skyscraper.

1199
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,470
你们都是建筑大师
Now, you're MasterBuilders.

1200
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:35,730
想想如果你们合作的话会发生什么
Just imagine what could happen if you did that.

1201
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:39,110
你们可以拯救这个世界
You could save the universe.

1202
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:42,280
说得好  埃米特  说得好
Well said, Emmet. Well said.

1203
00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:43,530
真的吗？
Really?

1204
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,070
小伙子  这确实是个好演讲
She be a fine speech there, laddie.

1205
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,700
好
Okay

1206
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:51,660
谁给我一些标签
Somebody get me some markers...

1207
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,500
一些建筑用纸
...some construction paper...

1208
00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:00,340
和一些闪光胶
...and some glitter glue!

1209
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:04,090
我把这个计划叫做
I call this:

1210
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:06,420
"埃米特计划进入奥坦塔
"Emmet's plan to get inside the Tower...

1211
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,180
把反抗法宝放到克拉格上
...put the Piece of Resistance on the Kragle...

1212
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:09,890
以拯救世界"
...and save the world."

1213
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,310
我在那座城市建了上百座像奥坦塔的建筑
I've built a hundred just like them back in the city.

1214
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,270
只要我们能进得去  我就能知道空气管道和线路的位置
If we can just get in, I know where the air ducts and wiring are located.

1215
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,430
我能把我们带到奥坦塔的任何地方
I can get us anywhere.

1216
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:17,890
拿我们该怎么进入奥坦塔呢
How will we get inside?

1217
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,730
通过一艘宇宙飞船
In a spaceship.

1218
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:22,570
-宇宙飞船  哈哈    -好主意  一艘蝙蝠宇宙飞船
- Spaceship! Ha, ha!   - Great idea. A Bat-Spaceship.

1219
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,940
不  他们就等着我们开
No, they're expecting us to show up...

1220
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:28,410
蝙蝠飞船  海盗飞船或彩虹飞船现身
...in a Bat-Spaceship, or a pirate spaceship or a rainbow-sparkle spaceship.

1221
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:29,780
我觉得其中之一听着不错
One of those sounds awesome to me.

1222
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:32,080
我的意见是建一艘
My idea is to build a spaceship...

1223
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:35,000
和奥坦塔运输飞船一模一样的宇宙飞船
...that's exactly like all the other Octan delivery spaceships.

1224
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:38,420
所以不是要我正在造的这种特殊飞船？
So not the special spaceship that I'm building for all of you right now?

1225
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:40,040
对不起  本尼  或许下次需要
Sorry, Benny. Maybe next time.

1226
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:43,170
你真是都要让我窒息了
Ooh, you're really letting the oxygen out of my tank here.

1227
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:46,460
但是根据你指导手册
Yeah, but according to your precious instructions...

1228
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,220
这艘飞船需要超光速引擎
...this ship needs a hyperdrive.

1229
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:49,340
但我们却没有那个
We don't have that part.

1230
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:50,430
也许我们可以找一个
Maybe we could find one!

1231
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,180
你想得美  你当宇宙飞船会凭空出现在我们面前吗
What do you think, a spaceship is just gonna appear out of the blue?

1232
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:54,510
这是在逗我嘛
Are you kidding me?

1233
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:55,850
宇宙飞船来了
The same thing!

1234
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:01,400
丘巴卡
Chewie!

1235
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:04,020
我们本来应该在去纳布星聚会的路上了
We're supposed to be halfway to Naboo for a sweet party!

1236
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:05,940
这个超光速引擎却老是出故障
This hyperdrive keeps malfunctioning...

1237
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:07,990
居然把我们带到这个垃圾星球来了
...taking us to loser systems like this.

1238
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,780
梭罗船长  我们得走了
Captain Solo, we must go.

1239
00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:11,820
你知道如果我们不守时的话  我会变得多么烦燥不安
You know how perturbed I get if we are not punctual.

1240
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:13,450
多罗德说得对  我们出发吧
The Droid's right. Let's roll.

1241
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,330
等等  汉
Now hold on, Han.

1242
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:18,000
这也许就是正确的星系
This might be the right galaxy after all.

1243
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,540
因为我看到一个漂亮的女士了
Because I see a heavenly body.

1244
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:24,290
喔哦  我已经有男朋友了  而且他很厉害的  对吧  亲爱的
Ooh, whoa, I have a boyfriend. And it is super serious. Right, babe?

1245
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:25,880
-当然了    -对嘛
- Of course it's serious.   - Yeah!

1246
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:28,050
-你的飞船上还有空位吗    -你干嘛呢  亲爱的
- Got room for just one dude?   - Whoa! Babe!

1247
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:30,340
像你这么酷的人  当然有位置了
If he's a cool dude like you.

1248
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:31,680
你想要抛弃我们
You're trying to bail on us!

1249
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:32,550
我们有想要抛下你
I'm not trying to bail!

1250
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,550
你都问他们飞船上是不是有空余的座位了
You asked them if you could go with them on their party ship!

1251
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,100
那飞船上充满了享乐主义者
That thing is filled with bon vivants.

1252
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:37,180
你现在说法语了？
You speak French now?

1253
00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:40,560
听着  亲爱的  要想我们的恋爱关系维持下去
Babe, look, if this relationship is ever gonna work between us...

1254
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:42,190
任何时候我就得拥有选择
...I need to feel free to party...

1255
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,230
和一群陌生人去参加派对的权利
...with a bunch of strangers whenever I feel like it.

1256
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:44,980
你说什么
What?

1257
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:45,940
亲爱的
Babe!

1258
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,990
我会给你发短信的
I will text you.

1259
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:52,450
兄弟  你哪弄来这么好的飞船的
Where'd you get that sweet space cape, brother?

1260
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,700
现在是派对时间
It's party time!

1261
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:57,830
亲爱的
Babe?

1262
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:10,090
温斯黛  你是一个非常了不起的人
Wyldstyle, you're such an amazing person.

1263
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:14,340
你知道吗  如果蝙蝠侠看不到这一点  那么他就...
And, you know, if Batman can't see that, then he's just--

1264
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:18,600
他就和那些盲人一样
Well, he's just as blind as a guy...

1265
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:21,730
瞎了眼
...whose eyes stopped working.

1266
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,520
说句心里话
And I'm gonna tell you something:

1267
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:27,110
蝙蝠侠是我见过的人里面最糟糕的
Batman is the worst person I've ever met.

1268
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,110
-需要超光速引擎吗？    -不是吧
- Need a hyperdrive?   - No way.

1269
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,990
-亲爱的    -我就知道  我就知道你不会离开的
- Babe!   - I knew it! I knew that.

1270
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,490
你刚才真的骗到我了
You really had me there!

1271
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,490
那几个人太傻了  他们会做的只是玩空间跳棋
Those guys were so lame. All they did was play space checkers.

1272
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:37,530
另外  原来那个长头发的居然是个男的
Plus, it turns out the hairy one's a dude.

1273
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:39,330
还有那个机器人  全都是男的
And the metal one too. All dudes.

1274
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:41,540
但他们不会注意到他们的超光速引擎没了吗
But won't they notice their hyperdrive is missing?

1275
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:44,870
快点  丘巴卡  发动超光速引擎
Come on, Chewie, hit the hyperdrive.

1276
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:49,000
不用担心  他们不会有事的
Nah, they'll be fine.

1277
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:52,000
让我们建一艘宇宙飞船

1278
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:53,460
第1步：
Step one:

1279
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:56,800
好了  我们需要一个四件套的红色部件
All right, we need a red four-piece unit over at the--

1280
00:57:57,050 --> 00:57:57,640
独角猫
Unikitty...

1281
00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:00,970
你应该要遵守规则  记得吗
you're supposed to follow the instructions, remember?

1282
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:01,850
对不起
Sorry.

1283
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:03,350
呃  这些规则让我神经过敏
Ugh, this gives me the jeebies.

1284
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,150
我应该要...我做不到
What do I even--? I can't--!

1285
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:09,520
好
Nice!

1286
00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:11,040
第2步：
Step two:

1287
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:12,490
我们驾驶这艘飞船混入奥坦公司的飞船中
We pilot the ship to the service entrance...

1288
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,650
这样我们就可以免除入口的危险
...so we can get past the dangerous...

1289
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,280
这还挺酷的
...but also kind of cool...

1290
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:17,570
激光门
...laser gate.

1291
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:19,410
请出示证明
Space ID.

1292
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:20,580
我有驾驶证的
I have a drive-on.

1293
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,040
你们来这找谁
Who are you here to see?

1294
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:23,710
你是来这看你的屁股的
I'm here to see Your Butt.

1295
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,330
是姓"屁股"  名"你"吗  还是
Is that last name "Butt," first name "Your," or is it--?

1296
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:27,170
哦  我的天呐
Oh, my gosh!

1297
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:38,300
一击即中
First try!

1298
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:42,640
第3步：我们闯进邪恶暴君的办公室
Step three." We break into Lord Business' office...

1299
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:45,310
然后我们会掠夺他收藏的宝物来伪装自己
...and we'll plunder his collection of relics for disguises.

1300
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:47,060
第4步：
Step four:

1301
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:48,520
本尼和金属胡子
Benny and Metal Beard...

1302
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:50,060
偷偷潜入主控制室
will sneak their way into the master control room.

1303
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,400
部门12的运动传感器被触发
Motion sensors triggered in Sector 12.

1304
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:53,280
10-4跟我来
10-4.

1305
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:01,200
你的想法和我一样吗
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

1306
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:02,660
开始吧
Do it.

1307
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:08,370
金属胡子  刚才这招太酷了
Metal Beard, that was awesome!

1308
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:10,340
海盗第一定律：
First law of the sea...

1309
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:13,760
永远别把你的屁股对着海盗的脸
...never place your rear end on a pirate's face.

1310
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:16,130
一旦进入主控制室  他们就可以操控电脑
Once inside, they'll use their technical know-how...

1311
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:17,630
来解除克拉格外围的防护盾
...to disable the Kragle shield.

1312
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:18,840
我是计算机
I am the computer.

1313
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:21,260
太帅了  能说话的计算机
Cool! Talking computer.

1314
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:24,680
请解除防护盾系统
Please disable the shield systems.

1315
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:26,060
如你所愿
Of course.

1316
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,690
没有找到与你所说名字相符的电影
There are no movies in your area with that title.

1317
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:31,060
第5步：
Step five:

1318
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:33,360
维特鲁威注意警戒  以确保我们不会被跟踪
Vitruvius will provide lookout and make sure we're not being followed.

1319
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:34,730
好的
Okay.

1320
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:37,950
第6步：蝙蝠侠和独角猫进入会议室
Step six: Batman and Unikitty go into the boardroom...

1321
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,450
去给邪恶暴君的计划做一些变动
...to make one last change to Lord Business' plan.

1322
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:43,450
我提议我们将整个宇宙粘住  有谁有不同意见吗
I move that we freeze the universe. Can I get a second on that?

1323
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:44,370
我有不同意见
I second.

1324
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:47,080
我是布鲁斯·韦恩  韦恩集团的CEO
Bruce Wayne, CEO of Wayne Enterprises.

1325
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:47,080
{\an8}布鲁斯·韦恩：蝙蝠侠的真名

1326
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:49,920
布鲁斯·韦恩  额  那是谁
Bruce Wayne? Uh, who's that?

1327
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:52,380
听起来是个很酷的人
Sounds like a cool guy.

1328
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:55,590
我们想要在你们公司做投资
We'd like to invest in your company.

1329
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:58,380
你想用超级武器控制宇宙的计划听上去不错
Your weapon to control the universe sounds super sweet...

1330
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,800
-我必须得说    -确实是的
-...I must say.   - It is, indeed, super sweet.

1331
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:03,550
很好  这个计划的语音系统是什么样的
Cool. What kind of sound system does it have?

1332
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:06,600
额  语音系统？  我们有个iPod Shuffle播放器
Uh, sound system? Well, I mean, we have an iPod Shuffle.

1333
01:00:06,850 --> 01:00:07,770
等等
Wait a second.

1334
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:09,890
你是想说告诉我  你有个机器来控制宇宙
You're telling me you have a machine to control the universe...

1335
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:12,110
但它却不能用来听环绕声吗
...and you can't listen to tunes in surround sound?

1336
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,270
真是尴尬
Embarrassing.

1337
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,480
额  我的意思是
Well, I mean...

1338
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:16,820
我们会把音效系统完成  我要八英尺的扬声器
...we need to get that done. I want eight-foot speakers.

1339
01:00:17,070 --> 01:00:17,740
好主意
Great call.

1340
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:21,030
是的  我要你们可以用你的手臂和双腿来拥抱扬声器
Yeah, I want speakers that you can hug with your arms and your legs...

1341
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,820
然后去感受音乐的节奏
...and just feel the beat.

1342
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:27,410
都听好了  我们需要给TAKOS设计出新的扬声器系统
Listen up! We need new instructions for a speaker system for the TAKOS.

1343
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:28,580
我们不会帮你的
We'll never help.

1344
01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:29,830
你说什么我们就做什么  长官
Whatever you say, boss.

1345
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,460
一旦扬声器做好后
Then once the instructions are printed...

1346
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:34,790
我和温斯黛就会进入安放克拉格的房间
Wyldstyle and I will enter the Kragle room...

1347
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,800
把克拉格放进反抗法宝
...place the thing on the other thing...

1348
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,840
这样就可以拯救世界
...and save the universe.

1349
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:41,590
等等  我没画那个  那是爆炸吗
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, I didn't draw that. Is that me exploding?

1350
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,340
额  我之前没有给你提过这点吗
Uh, I didn't mention that earlier?

1351
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:46,470
当你将反抗法宝和克拉格重聚  就会有可能发生爆炸
When you reunite the Piece with the Kragle, it might explode?

1352
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,520
你没提过  也有可能不是爆炸的  对吧？
No! But it might not, right?

1353
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,150
当然  当然  我们继续说吧
Sure, sure, sure. Let's go with that.

1354
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:55,020
全体人员注意  扬声器送过来了
Attention, everybody! Incoming speaker delivery!

1355
01:01:05,490 --> 01:01:06,410
你们两个是？
Who are you two?

1356
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:08,870
我们是楼下的搬运工
We are transfers from downstairs.

1357
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,040
-什么？    -再说一遍？
- What?   - Excuse me?

1358
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:13,040
你这机器人的声音听起来像人类的声音一样糟糕
Your robot voice sounds an awful lot like a human voice.

1359
01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:15,290
你省省吧  我以前不是机器人
Give me a break. I've never been a robot before.

1360
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:17,590
你什么意思啊  你一直是个机器人啊
What do you mean? You have always been a robot!

1361
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,710
不  不  不 别听她的
No, no, no, do not listen to her.

1362
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:21,720
你们的机器人序列号是什么
What are your robot serial numbers?

1363
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:29,930
一切妙不可言
Everything is awesome

1364
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:32,640
这是我最喜欢的歌
No way. This is my jam.

1365
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:34,480
这也是我最喜欢的歌
This is also my jam.

1366
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:36,440
一切妙不可言
Everything is awesome

1367
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:38,820
当你成为团队的一部分  一切都是如此美好
Everything is cool When you're part of a team

1368
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:41,690
-还需要多些和声    -我不想唱这首歌  我不是...
- Needs great harmonies.   - I don't want to sing the song. I'm not--

1369
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:44,240
一切妙不可言
Everything is awesome

1370
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:47,910
当你成为团队的一部分  一切都是如此美好
Everything is cool When you're part of a team

1371
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,500
一切妙不可言
Everything is awesome

1372
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:53,410
当我们实现梦想
When we're living our dream

1373
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,040
快点  我们走
Quick, let's go.

1374
01:01:55,290 --> 01:01:56,540
一切妙不可言
Everything is awesome

1375
01:01:56,790 --> 01:01:58,500
我还以为你不喜欢那首歌呢
Hmm, I thought you didn't like that song.

1376
01:01:58,750 --> 01:01:59,710
我确实不喜欢
I don't.

1377
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:01,420
嗯哼
Mm-hm.

1378
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,260
我知道你表现的很强硬
I know you put on this tough act...

1379
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:05,970
但我觉得你是刀子嘴豆腐心
...but I don't think you're as mean as you're trying to seem.

1380
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:07,550
我一点也不刻薄  你到底再说什么
I'm not mean. What are you talking about?

1381
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,560
我只是想说  你就像这样  "维特鲁威   他不是救世主
I'm just saying, you were all, "He's not The Special, Vitruvius.

1382
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:13,600
他不可能会是救世主  这个人  你别和我开玩笑了"
He can't possibly be The Special. This guy? Are you kidding me?"

1383
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:17,310
无论如何  我觉得那不是真正的你
Anyways, I don't think that's you.

1384
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:19,230
真正的你  总之
The real you, anyway.

1385
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:29,120
听着  埃米特
Look, Emmet.

1386
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:32,450
我希望那个命中注定的人是我
I wanted it to be me, okay?

1387
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:35,250
我希望自己成为救世主
I wanted to be The Special.

1388
01:02:35,870 --> 01:02:39,380
我知道这听上去很幼稚  只是...
And I know that sounds super mature. It's just...

1389
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:43,130
自从我听说这个预言后  我就想成为这个天命所归的人
...ever since I heard the prophecy, I wanted to be the One.

1390
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,630
在那个建筑工地里  我的判断是正确的
I was right there in that construction site...

1391
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:49,300
我就站在反抗之宝的上方  然而
...right on top of it, and then...

1392
01:02:50,890 --> 01:02:52,270
最终那个命中注定的人却是你
...it turned out to be you.

1393
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:02,070
在你说我是救世主的那个晚上
That night in the city, when you thought I was The Special...

1394
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:08,410
你说我是最具天赋和最重要的人
...and you said I was talented and important...

1395
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:12,620
那是我第一次被人这样夸奖
...that was the first time anyone had ever really told me that.

1396
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:15,460
这也使得我下定决心  无论怎么做
And it made me wanna do everything I could...

1397
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:17,540
我也要成为你说的那个人
...to be the guy you were talking about.

1398
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:21,960
露西
Lucy.

1399
01:03:22,210 --> 01:03:23,380
什么
What?

1400
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,880
露西才是我的真名
That was my real name.

1401
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:28,680
你之前问过我  而我的答案是我叫
You asked earlier, and it's...

1402
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:31,050
露西
...Lucy.

1403
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,060
我喜欢这个名字
I really like that name.

1404
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:40,770
嘿
Hey

1405
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:42,940
-你们这两个失败者在讨论什么呢    -什么  哦  我们没说什么
- What are you two losers talking about?   - Huh? What? Oh, nothing.

1406
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:45,940
我是过来帮你们的  我把独角猫留在那拖住他们了
Thought I'd help you guys. Left the weird cat thing to stall.

1407
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:48,240
商业  商业  商业  数据
Business, business, business. Numbers.

1408
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:50,160
-听的明白吗    -是的
- Is this working?   - Yes.

1409
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:51,160
太好了
Yay!

1410
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:52,700
坏警察在那
There's Bad Cop.

1411
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:56,540
哦  丹尼少年  当风笛...
Oh, Danny boy, the pipes--

1412
01:03:56,790 --> 01:03:58,540
好了  等着我的信号
Okay. Wait for my signal.

1413
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:00,210
祝你好运  埃米特
Good luck, Emmet.

1414
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:01,710
露西
Lucy.

1415
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,670
我想这就是永别了
I guess this might be goodbye.

1416
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:08,300
我不喜欢说再见  我们还是把这叫做
I don't like goodbyes. Let's just call this:

1417
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,640
"待会见"
"See you later, alligator."

1418
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:13,520
{\an8}英语中一句告别时的玩笑话  关键在于later和alligator尾音押韵
alligator没有意义  只是为了让整句话听起来较押韵而已

1419
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:13,510
"待会见  短吻鳄"？
"See you later, alligator"?

1420
01:04:15,430 --> 01:04:17,520
一会见  鳄鱼
After a while, crocodile.

1421
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:21,730
谁是露西
Who's Lucy?

1422
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:23,400
蝙蝠侠  当我们进入这间房间时
Batman, when we get inside this room...

1423
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:25,110
房间中会布满音频传感器
...there are gonna be audio sensors everywhere.

1424
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:27,240
所以我们必须保持绝对的安静
We have to be really, really quiet.

1425
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:30,400
别担心  我已经读过你那愚蠢的指南了  别再对我吼了
Don't worry, Dad, I read your dumb instructions. Stop yelling at me.

1426
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:31,950
本尼  防护盾那边如何了
Benny, what's our status with the shield?

1427
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,320
哦  耶  不  我这进行的很好
Oh, yeah, no, it's going great.

1428
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:35,950
就是很好  为什么就没有人听我说话呢
It's just going great, if somebody would listen to me!

1429
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,330
正在下载最新一集的《我的裤子在哪里》
Downloading latest episode of Where Are My Pants?

1430
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:41,080
你从哪里得到的裤子  你知道我想要什么
Where are you getting "pants" from? You know what I want!

1431
01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:42,380
当风笛呼唤
The pipes are calling--

1432
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:44,090
我是坏警察
Bad Cop.

1433
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:46,130
你好  我是商业之王的助理
Hi, this is Lord Business' assistant.

1434
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:48,300
他要你现在马上到他办公室见他
He would like you to come to his office immediately.

1435
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:49,170
明白
Copy that.

1436
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:51,260
-多谢    -不客气  先生
- Thanks.   - You are welcome, sir.

1437
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:55,600
嘿  你是谁
Hey, who is that?

1438
01:04:58,850 --> 01:04:59,850
信号来了
That's the signal...

1439
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:02,020
但是防护罩还没解除
...but the shield is still up.

1440
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:03,600
那我们就即兴表演
We'll wing it.

1441
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:06,610
这是个双关语
That's a bat pun.

1442
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:09,860
嘘  本尼
Shh. Benny...

1443
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:11,570
快解除防护罩
...disable the shield.

1444
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:12,780
-解除防护罩    -就是现在
- Disable the shield.   - Now.

1445
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:14,160
解除防护罩
Disable the shield.

1446
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:16,080
-正在查找阿尔巴尼亚的餐馆    -什么？
- Searching for Albanian restaurants.   - What?

1447
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:19,040
-不  我没有说过那个    -我听不明白你在说什么
- No! I never once said anything--!   - I don't understand what you mean.

1448
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:20,660
解除防护罩
Disable the shield!

1449
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:21,870
本尼  到底怎么了
Benny, what's going on?

1450
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:23,580
解除防护罩  快啊
Disable the shield! Come on!

1451
01:05:23,830 --> 01:05:25,290
你在耍我吗
You are undermining me!

1452
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:27,380
你想要我在哪句话加下划线
Which phrase would you like me to underline?

1453
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:28,670
解除防护罩
Disable the shield!

1454
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:30,130
让我试试
Let me try.

1455
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:34,470
解除防护罩
Be ye disabling of yon shield.

1456
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:35,430
防护罩解除中
Disabling shield.

1457
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:36,300
不是吧？
What?

1458
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:42,810
好了  3
Okay, in three...

1459
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:45,350
2
...two...

1460
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:47,980
1
...one.

1461
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,780
动手吧
Let's do this.

1462
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:52,950
露西
Lucy!

1463
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:56,780
露西
Lucy!

1464
01:05:58,580 --> 01:05:59,580
不
No!

1465
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:02,460
哦  不是吧
Oh, man.

1466
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:03,910
不要
Oh, no.

1467
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:05,080
哦哦
Uh-oh.

1468
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:08,250
在拐角处鬼鬼祟祟
Sneaking around the corner...

1469
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:11,840
维特鲁威
Vitruvius.

1470
01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:15,510
看来你不小心闯进我的思维牢笼了
I see you've accidentally wandered into my Think Tank.

1471
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,930
另外  我还抓到了你的一些朋友
And by the way, I found a few of your friends.

1472
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:21,060
-我是指将他们所有人一网打尽了    -抱歉
- By which I mean all of them!   - Sorry!

1473
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:22,980
干得好  坏警察
Acceptable work, Bad Cop.

1474
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:23,890
多谢夸奖  长官
Thank you, sir.

1475
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:26,730
小的们  给我把这个老头子
Robots, destroy this old man at once.

1476
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:28,270
你刚刚说我老吗
Did you just call me "old"?

1477
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:29,730
是的  你不服吗
Yeah. So what?

1478
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:33,530
你知道吗  臭甲虫  我更喜欢你说我
Well, Junebug, I really prefer the word...

1479
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:34,780
经验丰富
..."experienced"!

1480
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:51,590
啊哈
Aha.

1481
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:52,630
你看到了吗  埃米特
You see, Emmet?

1482
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,090
一个堕落的灵魂是敌不过纯净的想象力的
A corrupted spirit is no match for the purity of imagina--

1483
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:00,850
-哈哈哈    -维特鲁威
- Ha-ha-ha!   - Vitruvius!

1484
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:02,560
不
No!

1485
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:05,890
维特鲁威
Vitruvius.

1486
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:10,060
我亲爱的埃米特  走近点
My sweet Emmet. Come closer.

1487
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,650
有些关于预言的事情你得知道
You must know something about the prophecy.

1488
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:14,650
我知道  我已经尽我所能了
I know, I'm doing my best...

1489
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:15,610
但我...
...but I don't--

1490
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:17,280
所谓的预言
The prophecy...

1491
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:19,030
都是我瞎编出来的
I made it up.

1492
01:07:19,530 --> 01:07:20,570
什么？
What?

1493
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,790
预言是我编出来的  它不是真的
I made it up. It's not true.

1494
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:26,290
那就意味着我只是...
But that means I'm just--

1495
01:07:26,790 --> 01:07:28,290
我不是救世主？
I'm not The Special?

1496
01:07:28,830 --> 01:07:29,790
你一定要仔细听好了
You must listen.

1497
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,250
我将要告诉你的
What I'm about to tell you...

1498
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:35,130
将会改变历史的进程
...will change the course of history.

1499
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:40,800
不
No.

1500
01:07:41,550 --> 01:07:42,640
这不是真的
No.

1501
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,400
嘿
Hey.

1502
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:54,320
不再觉得自己与众不同了吧？
Not so special anymore, huh?

1503
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:57,990
你猜怎么着
Well, guess what.

1504
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,530
从来没有人说过我是与众不同的
No one ever told me I was special.

1505
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:04,120
我也没有什么值得炫耀的奖杯
I never got a trophy just for showing up!

1506
01:08:04,370 --> 01:08:07,540
我也不是什么特殊的小雪花
I'm not some special little snowflake...

1507
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,130
但即便是如此平凡的我
But as unspecial as I am...

1508
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:14,420
你也还要比我平凡
...you are a thousand-billion times...

1509
01:08:14,670 --> 01:08:16,130
成千上万倍
...more unspecial than me.

1510
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:19,470
小的们  把清零之剑给我拿来
Robots, bring me the Sword of Exact Zero.

1511
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,010
是  商业之王
Yes, Lord Business.

1512
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,220
你一定觉得很奇怪
It must be weird.

1513
01:08:23,470 --> 01:08:27,180
前一分钟  你还是这个世界上最与众不同的人
One minute, you're the most special person in the universe.

1514
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:30,480
这会你却什么都不是
And the next minute, you're nobody.

1515
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,650
我还在我的收藏室给它留了个好位置
Oh, I have a nice spot for this in my relic room.

1516
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,990
哦  我的错
Uh-oh! My mistake!

1517
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:39,700
不小心飞出去了
There it goes!

1518
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:40,450
不
No!

1519
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,660
再见  再也不见
Bye-bye forever!

1520
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:46,700
好了  现在只剩下一件事还没做了
Well, I guess there's only one thing left to do!

1521
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:50,580
发射克拉格
Release the Kragle!

1522
01:08:52,830 --> 01:08:53,830
-计算机    -遵命  长官
- Computer!   - Yes, sir.

1523
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,090
设置倒计时100秒
Set the electric shocker to 100 Mississippi.

1524
01:08:54,090 --> 01:08:56,090
{\an8}一般认为读1个mississippi的时间是1秒  故可以用来表示秒

1525
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:57,090
好的
No problem.

1526
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:59,380
-然后把所有人给终结了    -已经在进行中了
- Then terminate everyone.   - Already on it.

1527
01:08:59,630 --> 01:09:01,590
埃米特  你将会有足够的时间
Emmet, that should give you enough time...

1528
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,680
来见证克拉格第一个终结的地方
...to witness the first location to be Kragled.

1529
01:09:03,930 --> 01:09:05,430
-你的家乡    -不
- Your hometown.   - No!

1530
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:08,390
很不幸的告诉你  坏警察  我要把你留在这等死
Bad Cop, unfortunately, I'm gonna have to leave you here to die.

1531
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:09,730
什么？  长官
What? Sir.

1532
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:11,480
这无关私人恩怨
It's not personal.

1533
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:13,650
只是例行公事罢了
It's just business.

1534
01:09:14,190 --> 01:09:16,230
商业之王的公事
Lord Business.

1535
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:17,730
再见
Ciao.

1536
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:21,280
将在99秒后
Beginning zapping termination...

1537
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:23,200
开启消灭终结程序
...in 99 Mississippi...

1538
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:25,200
98秒
...98 Mississippi...

1539
01:09:25,450 --> 01:09:27,200
97秒
97 Mississippi...

1540
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:28,950
以此类推
...and so on.

1541
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,390
所有人主意
Attention, everyone.

1542
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:53,310
我是你们的总统
This is President Business.

1543
01:09:54,810 --> 01:09:55,600
大家好
Hello.

1544
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:57,860
欢迎来到墨西哥卷饼星期二
Hi, welcome to Taco Tuesday!

1545
01:09:58,570 --> 01:10:00,690
不用担心这个大型的
Don't worry about this big black...

1546
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:02,860
挡住太阳的庞然大物
...monolith thing that's blocking out the sun.

1547
01:10:03,610 --> 01:10:04,820
你们需要担心的是
What you need to worry about...

1548
01:10:05,070 --> 01:10:07,490
我接下来要问的这个问题
...is this question that I'm about to ask you:

1549
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:10,120
有谁想要墨西哥卷饼
Who wants a taco?

1550
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,460
我就知道你们都想要
Yeah! I know!

1551
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:17,130
墨西哥卷饼  墨西哥卷饼  让我们疯狂起来吧
Tacos, tacos! We're going crazy! Yeah.

1552
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:19,210
所有人注意
All right, everyone.

1553
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:20,840
表现的像平常一样
Act normal.

1554
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:23,920
完美
Perfect.

1555
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:26,760
现在  所有人说"冻结"
Now, everybody say "Freeze!"

1556
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:33,480
看来乱跑和尖叫才是正常的
So I guess running around and screaming is normal.

1557
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:36,310
机器经理们  启动"自动造型"程序
Micro-managers, commence micro-management.

1558
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,980
"自动造型"程序已启动
Commencing micro-management.

1559
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:43,070
怎么回事  我动不了了
What's going on? I can't move!

1560
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:48,160
求求你  求求你  没有谁来救救我们吗
Please, please! Won't somebody help us?

1561
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:52,290
埃米特  你会像平常一样想出解决办法的  对吧
Emmet, you'll think of something, right? Like you always do.

1562
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:54,960
你没听到维特鲁威说的吗
Didn't you hear him?

1563
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:57,000
预言不过是他编造出来的
The prophecy's made-up.

1564
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,790
我不是救世主
I'm not The Special.

1565
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:03,510
曾经一度我甚至都觉得自己可能是救世主
And to think for a moment I thought I might be.

1566
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:07,890
-埃米特    -谁在说话
- Emmet.   - Who said that?

1567
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:09,390
我说的
I did.

1568
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:12,430
我是维特鲁威的鬼魂
I am Ghost Vitruvius.

1569
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:15,520
喔
Woo!

1570
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:18,730
埃米特  先前你没让我把话说完
Emmet, you didn't let me finish earlier.

1571
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:20,360
因为我死了
Because I died.

1572
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:22,230
我之所以编造出这个预言
The reason I made up the prophecy...

1573
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,940
是因为我知道  无论谁能找到反抗法宝
...was because I knew that whoever found the Piece...

1574
01:11:25,190 --> 01:11:26,820
都将成为救世主
...could become The Special.

1575
01:11:27,070 --> 01:11:29,740
因为想要与众不同的唯一条件
Because the only thing anyone needs to be special...

1576
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:32,530
就是要相信你自己可以做到
...is to believe that you can be.

1577
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:36,250
我知道这听起来可能很荒唐  但这是事实
I know that sounds like a cat poster, but it's true.

1578
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:40,540
看看你在相信自己是救世主之后所做的事情
Look at what you did when you believed you were special.

1579
01:11:40,790 --> 01:11:43,210
你只需要更加相信自己
You just need to believe it some more.

1580
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:46,720
但我怎么能在明知我自己不是救世主的时候
But how can I just decide to believe that I'm special...

1581
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:48,010
还相信自己是救世主呢
...when I'm not?

1582
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:52,050
因为世界的生死存亡就在此一举
Because the world depends on it.

1583
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:59,900
消灭终结程序将在35秒后启动
Zapping termination in 35 Mississippi...

1584
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:00,730
什么？
What?

1585
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:02,110
34秒
...34 Mississippi...

1586
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:04,110

01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:08,900

01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:10,570

1592
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:18,410

...26 Mississippi...

1593
01:12:18,910 --> 01:12:21,250
25秒
...25 Mississippi...

1594
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:22,290
24秒
...24 Mississippi...

1595
01:12:30,630 --> 01:12:31,760
埃米特
Emmet!

1596
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:32,930
你在干嘛
What are you--?

1597
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:34,640
18秒
18 Mississippi...

1598
01:12:34,890 --> 01:12:36,970
17秒
...17 Mississippi...

1599
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:38,730
-16秒    -露西
-...16 Mississippi...   - Lucy!

1600
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:40,310
-15秒    -等等  你在干嘛
-...15 Mississippi...   - Wait! What are you--?

1601
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:42,770
现在是你当英雄的时刻了
Now it's your turn to be the hero.

1602
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:44,650
-13秒    -不
- 13 Mississippi...   - No!

1603
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:46,360
12秒
12 Mississippi...

1604
01:12:46,610 --> 01:12:48,280
待会见
See you later, alligator.

1605
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:49,150
不要
Don't!

1606
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:53,160
不  埃米特
No, Emmet!

1607
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:55,660
7秒
7 Mississippi...

1608
01:12:55,910 --> 01:12:57,290
6秒
6 Mississippi...

1609
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:59,370

1614
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:08,710
0秒...程序出错
...0 Missi-- Error.

1615
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,470
终结程序启动失败
Termination failure.

1616
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:12,220
埃米特
Emmet!

1617
01:13:19,730 --> 01:13:21,100
不
No.

1618
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:29,740
他...他救了我们
He... He saved us.

1619
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:32,240
那我们现在该做什么
Well, what do we do now?

1620
01:13:32,490 --> 01:13:33,780
我们要看到这件事
There's gotta be a bright side...

1621
01:13:34,030 --> 01:13:34,740
好的一面
...here somewhere.

1622
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:36,530
有人有什么好的主意吗
Does anyone have any ideas?

1623
01:13:37,450 --> 01:13:38,990
埃米特总有主意
Emmet had ideas.

1624
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:43,250
这个世界就该多些像他这样的人
Arr, if only there were more people in the world like he.

1625
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,130
或许有的
Maybe there are.

1626
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:51,170
10秒后在楼下见我
Meet me downstairs in 10 seconds.

1627
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:52,900
10秒后

1628
01:13:53,260 --> 01:13:55,180
亲爱的  我的裤子
Honey, where are my...

1629
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:57,220
在哪里
...pant“?

1630
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:58,760
-你好   -你猜怎么着
- Hi!   - Hey, guess what.

1631
01:13:59,010 --> 01:14:01,430
我们找到你的裤子了  这个系列可以结束了  本尼
Found your pants. Series is over. Benny...

1632
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:03,940
现在马上进行全球直播
...send this out to everyone in the universe.

1633
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:05,940
80年代的科技
1980-something technology?

1634
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:07,560
这才对嘛
Now you're talking!

1635
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:13,360
额  嘿  大家好
Uh... Ahem. Hey, everybody.

1636
01:14:13,610 --> 01:14:17,200
你们也许不认识我  但既然我在电视上  你们可以相信我
You don't know me, but I'm on TV, so you can trust me.

1637
01:14:17,450 --> 01:14:19,910
我知道现在的境况很糟糕
I know things seem kind of bad right now.

1638
01:14:20,410 --> 01:14:22,580
但现在有个解决的办法
But there is a way out of this.

1639
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:25,080
这是埃米特
This is Emmet.

1640
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:27,460
他和你们一样
And he was just like all of you.

1641
01:14:27,710 --> 01:14:29,170
似曾相识的大众脸
A face in the crowd...

1642
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:31,460
和你们一样遵守着规则
...following the same instructions as you.

1643
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:35,050
他过分的融入这个群体  以至于没有人重视他
He was so good at fitting in, no one ever saw him.

1644
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:37,300
我欠你一个道歉
And I owe you an apology...

1645
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:39,930
因为我曾经很鄙视像他这样的人
...because I used to look down on people like that.

1646
01:14:39,930 --> 01:14:42,850
我以前认为他们他们是一群
"I used to think they were followers...

1647
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:45,690
没有思想或野心的追随者
...with no ideas or vision."

1648
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:48,230
但结果证明埃米特拥有很棒的主意
Because it turns out Emmet had great ideas.

1649
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,610
尽管这些主意看上去很奇怪
And even though they seemed weird...

1650
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:52,730
和毫无意义
...and kind of pointless...

1651
01:14:52,990 --> 01:14:54,530
但他做的却是最能够
...they actually came closer...

1652
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:57,280
拯救这个世界的方法
...than anyone else to saving the universe.

1653
01:14:57,610 --> 01:15:00,450
现在我们要完成他未完成的事业
And now we have to finish what he started...

1654
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:04,040
建造任何你心里想的东西
...by making whatever weird thing pops into our heads.

1655
01:15:04,290 --> 01:15:07,330
你们的内心深处都有着很好的创造能力
All of you have the ability inside of you to be a groundbreaker.

1656
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:08,790
我说的都是真的
And I mean literally!

1657
01:15:09,670 --> 01:15:10,920
打破地面
Break the ground!

1658
01:15:11,170 --> 01:15:12,090
掀开地板
Peel up the pieces...

1659
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:13,340
拆除墙壁
...tear apart your walls!

1660
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:15,300
建造出只有你们能做的东西
Build things only you could build.

1661
01:15:15,550 --> 01:15:16,680
来保护好自己
Defend yourselves.

1662
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:19,600
我们必须和邪恶暴君战斗
We need to fight back against President Business'...

1663
01:15:19,850 --> 01:15:21,850
是他计划冻结我们
plans to freeze us!

1664
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:25,020
今天绝不会是墨西哥卷饼星期二
Today will not be known as Taco Tuesday.

1665
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:28,560
它将会以自由星期五的名义被铭记
It will be known as Freedom Friday!

1666
01:15:30,690 --> 01:15:32,480
但我们仍然处在星期二
But still on a Tuesday!

1667
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:40,910
快停止直播
End of the line.

1668
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:44,750
坏警察？
Bad Cop?

1669
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,080
我觉得我的内心深处  仍然有个好警察
I hope there's still a Good Cop in me somewhere.

1670
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:52,880
我会在这挡住他们  你们去阻止邪恶暴君吧
I'll hold these guys off. You go stop them. Yay!

1671
01:15:53,130 --> 01:15:55,550
说得好  但是我们该怎么过去呢
Great idea, but how will we get there?

1672
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:57,670
小做一曲
T-minus one.

1673
01:15:57,930 --> 01:16:00,180
10  9  8
Ten, nine, eight...

1674
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:01,260
-7  6    -我可以...
-...seven, six...   - I could, uh...

1675
01:16:02,510 --> 01:16:03,560
-5  4    -我可以建个...
-...five, four...   - I could build a...

1676
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:05,430
3  2  1
...three, two, one.

1677
01:16:06,310 --> 01:16:07,680
我可以建一艘太空飞船
I could build a spaceship!

1678
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:11,690
你们不打算拒绝吗
You're not gonna say no?

1679
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:13,690
快建吧  虽然我不知道你叫什么
Build away, whatever your name is.

1680
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:15,400
-太好了    -哈哈哈
- Whoa! Yay!   - Ha-ha-ha!

1681
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:20,240
好的  宇宙飞船  宇宙飞船
Okay. Spaceship! Spaceship!

1682
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:24,030
宇宙飞船
spaceship!

1683
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:26,330
宇宙飞船
spaceship!

1684
01:16:26,870 --> 01:16:27,540
宇宙飞船
spaceship!

1685
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:28,750
宇宙飞船
spaceship!

1686
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,170
宇宙飞船
spaceship!

1687
01:16:30,870 --> 01:16:31,500
宇宙飞船
spaceship!

1688
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:32,630
宇宙飞船
spaceship!

1689
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:34,340
所有人注意  攻击那宇宙飞船
All units, attack that spaceship.

1690
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:36,800
宇宙飞船
spaceship!

1691
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:39,010
他去哪了
Where'd he go?

1692
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:40,050
宇宙飞船
Spaceship!

1693
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,180
温斯黛  快看
Wyldstyle, look...

1694
01:16:44,430 --> 01:16:46,560
是那些市民
...it's the citizens!

1695
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:53,520
冲啊
Tallyho!

1696
01:16:55,690 --> 01:16:58,150
别忘了我们这些建筑大师
And don't forget us MasterBuilders.

1697
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,280
发生什么事了
What is going on?

1698
01:17:00,530 --> 01:17:01,740
你快停止
You stop...

1699
01:17:01,990 --> 01:17:03,070
建造东西
...building that stuff!

1700
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:04,410
快停下
Just stop it!

1701
01:17:08,830 --> 01:17:09,410
干得好
Great job!

1702
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:10,750
这样或许真的能行
This might actually work.

1703
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,960
是你的演讲激励了大家
'Twas your speech which roused this hearty crew.

1704
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:16,920
如果埃米特看到这一幕
If only Emmet were here to see this.

1705
01:17:17,170 --> 01:17:19,340
他一定会说一些可爱的话  例如
He'd say something adorable like...

1706
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:25,970
我会这么
Am I just gonna keep...

1707
01:17:26,220 --> 01:17:27,220
永远
...falling...

1708
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:31,180
坠落吗
...forever?

1709
01:17:42,490 --> 01:17:44,160
这是另一个梦境吗
Is this another vision?

1710
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:47,990
我在哪
Where am I?

1711
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:52,120
那不是奥坦塔吗
Is that the Office Tower?

1712
01:17:58,670 --> 01:17:59,630
积木城堡
Bricksburg!

1713
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:02,300
那是什么
What was that?

1714
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:05,340
不  不  不
No, no, no.

1715
01:18:05,970 --> 01:18:06,550
不
No!

1716
01:18:09,010 --> 01:18:10,560
宇宙飞船  宇宙飞船  宇宙飞船
Spaceship, spaceship, spaceship!

1717
01:18:10,810 --> 01:18:13,100
这是什么样的世界啊
What in the world is that?

1718
01:18:15,230 --> 01:18:17,360
好可爱
It's adorable.

1719
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:23,780
不  不  喔  不...
No. No. Whoa, no, no, no.

1720
01:18:24,030 --> 01:18:25,160
嘿  不要吃我  不要吃我
Hey, don't eat me. Don't eat me.

1721
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:26,820
请你不要吃我
Do not eat me. Please.

1722
01:18:27,410 --> 01:18:28,740
你好  埃米特
Hi, Emmet.

1723
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:30,950
额
Uh...

1724
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,620
你好
Hi?

1725
01:18:35,710 --> 01:18:38,040
这就是传说中的
Is this The Man--?

1726
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:47,050
上帝吗
The Man Upstairs?

1727
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,020
怎么回事
What happened?

1728
01:18:57,020 --> 01:18:59,400
不  不  不  这简直是一场灾难
No, no, no, this is a disaster.

1729
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:03,030
为什么  为什么  怎么回事
Why--? Why--? What? What?

1730
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,240
这是怎么回事
What?

1731
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:08,280
为什么龙在豪华公寓楼顶
Why is the dragon on top of the luxury condo development?

1732
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:09,870
我只是在玩而已
But I was just playing--

1733
01:19:10,370 --> 01:19:11,700
听着  我知道对你来说有些难以理解
Look, I know it's hard to understand...

1734
01:19:11,950 --> 01:19:14,080
但这些是爸爸的东西
...but this is Dad's stuff, okay?

1735
01:19:14,370 --> 01:19:16,620
你眼前看到的这些
All of this that you see before you...

1736
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:18,630
都是你父亲我的
...is all your father's.

1737
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,750
这里的一切都是经过慎重考虑
And everything is thought-out very--

1738
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:22,300
你到下面做什么
What did you do down here?

1739
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:24,010
你把楼顶从这塔上卸下来了？
Did you take the top off of the tower?

1740
01:19:24,550 --> 01:19:25,880
这不过是个意外
It was an accident.

1741
01:19:26,130 --> 01:19:28,510
你是说你无意中
You accidentally...

1742
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:30,180
熟练的
...expertly...

1743
01:19:30,430 --> 01:19:33,270
但又小心翼翼的把整个塔顶给卸了？
...carefully took the entire top off of that tower?

1744
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:34,720
是的
Yes.

1745
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:36,640
你该知道规矩  这些不只是玩具
You know the rules. This isn't a toy.

1746
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:39,600
-额  但他们确实是的    -不
- Um, well, it kind of is.   - No.

1747
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:43,360
实际上  这是一个高度精细的积木系统
Actually, it's a highly sophisticated interlocking brick system.

1748
01:19:43,610 --> 01:19:45,860
-但我们就是从玩具店买回来的    -确实是的
- But we bought it at the toy store.   - We did.

1749
01:19:46,110 --> 01:19:49,110
但我却是把它们当成大人的东西来摆弄的
But the way I'm using it makes it an adult thing.

1750
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:51,370
这个盒子说了是给8-14岁的人玩的
The box for this one said ages 8 to 14.

1751
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:55,620
那不过是个建议  他们必须写上这个
That's a suggestion. They have to put that on there.

1752
01:19:55,870 --> 01:19:58,680
你不能指望我不去玩这些玩具
You can't expect me to be able to resist playing with all this.

1753
01:19:58,730 --> 01:20:01,590
听着  圣诞节我送了很多玩具给你
Look, You have your stuff over near the Christmas decorations.

1754
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:04,250
那些积木  随你怎么玩
All those bricks, you can build anything you want.

1755
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:11,220
芬恩  我们来玩个小游戏  这游戏称作
Finn, we're gonna play a little game. It's called:

1756
01:20:11,470 --> 01:20:14,260
"把所有你玩过的东西恢复原样"
"Let's Put Everything Back the Way You Found it."

1757
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:16,020
但是  爸爸  你不明白
But, Dad, you don't understand.

1758
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:19,350
这样我才能把所有东西变成他们本身应有的样子
So I can make things the way they're supposed to be.

1759
01:20:22,610 --> 01:20:24,020
永久不变
Permanently.

1760
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:28,360
更多的克拉格？
More Kragles?

1761
01:20:28,610 --> 01:20:31,110
让反叛到此为止吧
This rebellion ends right now.

1762
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:32,740
启动
Commencing...

1763
01:20:32,990 --> 01:20:34,160
自动造型程序
...micro-management.

1764
01:20:38,710 --> 01:20:40,330
哦  不  不要
Oh, no. No!

1765
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:47,010
哈哈  小心手雷
Ha, ha! Fire in the hole!

1766
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:52,390
等等  发生什么事了
Wait, what's happening?

1767
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:55,310
不  等等  不  我们在不断坠落  救命啊
No, wait! No, we're going down! Mayday!

1768
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,930
不
No!

1769
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:01,390
坚持住  杰夫  我们来救你了
Hold on, Jeff. We're coming for you!

1770
01:21:01,650 --> 01:21:02,350
不
No!

1771
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:03,230
快停下
Stop!

1772
01:21:03,940 --> 01:21:04,690
哦  不
Oh, no!

1773
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:16,160
啊  太多机器经理了
Arr, there be too many Micro-managers!

1774
01:21:16,410 --> 01:21:17,700
我现在拿着的是什么
What am I holding here?

1775
01:21:17,950 --> 01:21:20,790
-是一艘宇宙飞船    -不  这不过是大杂烩
-It's a battleship.   - No, it's a hodgepodge. That's what it is.

1776
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:22,250
蝙蝠侠怎么在这
What's Batman doing on it?

1777
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:24,420
这是什么  一个机器海盗？
What is this, a robot pirate?

1778
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,090
停下  快停下  不要  快停下  停下
Stop! Stop it! No! Stop it! Stop!

1779
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:31,340
你拿着那个建筑工人干嘛
You got glue all over that construction worker.

1780
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,800
快点  把他给我
Here. Give that to me.

1781
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:37,560
停下  停下  快停下
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

1782
01:21:37,610 --> 01:21:39,060
这些都是我的朋友们  不要  快停下
All of those are my friends! No, stop it!

1783
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:42,690
我们是一个很棒的团队  朋友们
Ye were a hearty crew. But it be...

1784
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:45,270
但一切都将结束
It be over.

1785
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:47,360
不
No!

1786
01:21:50,190 --> 01:21:51,530
反抗法宝
The Piece of Resistance!

1787
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:53,280
我还可以拯救他们
I can still save them!

1788
01:21:53,530 --> 01:21:56,950
让我们把这种粘性物质从这个建筑工人身上取下来
Let's get this gunk off this construction worker.

1789
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:59,490
它不只是个建筑工人  爸爸  他是个英雄
He's not just a construction worker, Dad. He's the hero.

1790
01:21:59,740 --> 01:22:01,410
不  他不是
Nope, he's not.

1791
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:04,250
他不过是一个普普通通
He is a ordinary, regular...

1792
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:06,080
的建筑工人
...generic construction worker...

1793
01:22:06,330 --> 01:22:09,050
而且我得把他放到属于他的地方去
...and I need to put him back where he belongs.

1794
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:13,170
我的雕刻刀在哪
Now, where is my X-Acto knife?

1795
01:22:16,010 --> 01:22:18,640
我必须拿到反抗法宝
I gotta get the Piece of Resistance.

1796
01:22:19,390 --> 01:22:22,520
如果我可以吸引到那个小造物主的注意
If I could get the attention of the smaller creature.

1797
01:22:23,270 --> 01:22:24,350
我得行动起来了
I gotta move.

1798
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,730
雕刻刀跑哪去了
Where is that?

1799
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:28,770
行动
Move!

1800
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,410
好了
All right.

1801
01:23:00,430 --> 01:23:01,010
移动
Move!

1802
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:07,940
现在  我没有移动
Now, I didn't move--

1803
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:12,780
噢
OW.

1804
01:23:15,570 --> 01:23:16,860
-爸爸    -干嘛
- Uh, Dad?   - Yeah.

1805
01:23:17,110 --> 01:23:20,080
我好像看到雕刻刀新西兰中部那
I think I saw the X-Acto over there near Middle Zealand.

1806
01:23:20,330 --> 01:23:21,660
哦  太好了  多谢
Oh, great. Thank you.

1807
01:23:21,910 --> 01:23:23,080
不用客气
Welcome.

1808
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:32,500
现在一切都得看你了  埃米特
It's up to you now, Emmet.

1809
01:23:42,390 --> 01:23:43,720
相信自己
Believe.

1810
01:23:44,970 --> 01:23:47,390
我知道我看起来像是张海报
I know that sounds like a cat poster...

1811
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:49,230
但这是真的
...but it's true.

1812
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:58,490
喔
Whoa!

1813
01:24:11,290 --> 01:24:12,290
抱歉  街道
Sorry, street.

1814
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:19,510
吼吼
Ho-ho!

1815
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:27,390
我现在可以洞穿万物
I can see everything.

1816
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:31,600
哈哈
Ha, ha!

1817
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:33,310
这鬼东西是什么
What the heck is this?

1818
01:24:33,570 --> 01:24:35,610
我是个建筑大师
I am a MasterBuilder.

1819
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:41,030
派出我们所有的机器经理
Release every Micro-manager we have!

1820
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,870
让我们抓住他  兄弟们
Let's get him, fellas!

1821
01:24:46,870 --> 01:24:48,040
嗨  各位
Hey, everyone!

1822
01:24:48,290 --> 01:24:50,170
-埃米特    -埃米特  加油
- Emmet!   - Emmet! Yay!

1823
01:24:53,170 --> 01:24:55,710
露西  我要冲进去了
Lucy, I'm going inside that thing.

1824
01:24:56,250 --> 01:24:57,210
放心吧  埃米特
You've got it, Emmet.

1825
01:24:57,460 --> 01:25:00,010
尝尝这个  哈哈
Take that! Ha, ha!

1826
01:25:00,260 --> 01:25:01,430
晚上好  过来
Good night! Come here!

1827
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:03,300
我们会帮助你的  孩子
We'll help you out, kid.

1828
01:25:03,550 --> 01:25:06,060
这就是我的海盗风格
Here's how we do it pirate-style!

1829
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:09,640
埃米特  就在那里
Yes! Emmet! That's it!

1830
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:13,730
干掉他  小的们
Take him down, boys!

1831
01:25:17,650 --> 01:25:18,650
埃米特
Emmet!

1832
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:22,860
保持乐观
Stay positive.

1833
01:25:23,990 --> 01:25:25,160
他们要把我活活撕裂了
They're tearing me apart!

1834
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:27,790
保持乐观
Stay positive.

1835
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:28,910
快点帮帮我
Come on!

1836
01:25:29,330 --> 01:25:30,750
哦  算了吧
Oh, forget it!

1837
01:25:36,290 --> 01:25:38,960
老虎不发威  你们当我是病猫啊
You all need to be more friendly!

1838
01:25:41,590 --> 01:25:42,590
埃米特  快走
Emmet, go!

1839
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:43,930
快走  现在是你的...
Go! Now's your...

1840
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:45,550
-机会    -她说的对
- ...chance!   - She's right!

1841
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:48,640
-你能行的  孩子    -继续  冲进去
- You can do it, me laddie!   - Go on, kid. Get in there!

1842
01:25:56,310 --> 01:25:57,230
长官  有入侵者
Sir, we got an intrud--!

1843
01:25:59,230 --> 01:26:00,360
邪恶暴君
Lord Business.

1844
01:26:00,610 --> 01:26:02,280
你死而复生了？
Back from the dead, Brickowski?

1845
01:26:02,530 --> 01:26:03,660
但是一切都晚了
Well, you're too late!

1846
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:05,280
小的们  抓住他
Skeletrons, get him!

1847
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:17,790
该死  我动不了了
Argh! I can't move!

1848
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:20,090
看到没  你的朋友们
You see, your friends...

1849
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:21,130
哦  他们完蛋了
...oh, they're finished!

1850
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:23,720
我的世界已经基本快完成了
My world is almost finished.

1851
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:27,930
就只剩下了结了
The last thing I need to do is finish...

1852
01:26:28,180 --> 01:26:29,640
-你    -不  求求你住手
-...you.   - No, stop! Please!

1853
01:26:29,890 --> 01:26:32,520
如果你再过来  我就要发动我的秘密武器了
If you do one more thing, I'm gonna unleash my secret weapon.

1854
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:34,390
你的秘密武器？
Your secret weapon?

1855
01:26:35,140 --> 01:26:37,520
是的  它就叫做
Yes, it's called:

1856
01:26:37,770 --> 01:26:39,770
救世主的力量
The Power of The Special.

1857
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:41,280
听起来很蠢
That sounds dumb.

1858
01:26:42,070 --> 01:26:45,450
那好吧  它来了  我的秘密武器就是
All right, here it comes. My secret weapon...

1859
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:47,740
这个
...is this.

1860
01:26:49,030 --> 01:26:51,620
这是什么  是太小了吗  我什么都没看到
What is that? Is it super small? I don't see anything.

1861
01:26:51,870 --> 01:26:54,040
是我的手  我希望我们能够携手
It's my hand. I want you to take it.

1862
01:26:54,290 --> 01:26:55,670
你希望我和你携手合作？
You want me to take your hand off?

1863
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:58,590
不  我希望你能加入我们
No, I want you to join me.

1864
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:02,130
看看这些人们建造的事物
Look at all of these things that people built.

1865
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:03,720
你看到的或许是一团糟
You might see a mess...

1866
01:27:03,970 --> 01:27:06,590
正式  还有一堆奇怪、过时的东西
Exactly. And a bunch of weird, dorky stuff...

1867
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:09,100
毁了我那些完美的事物
...that ruined my perfectly good stuff!

1868
01:27:10,050 --> 01:27:11,930
好吧  但我看到的是
Okay. What I see...

1869
01:27:12,430 --> 01:27:15,600
人们相互激励
...are people inspired by each other...

1870
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:17,560
也被你所激励
...and by you.

1871
01:27:18,690 --> 01:27:21,230
人们通过你建造的东西
People taking what you made...

1872
01:27:21,770 --> 01:27:24,030
又建造出更多新的东西
...and making something new out of it.

1873
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:42,210
芬恩  这些都是你做的吗
Finn, did you make all of this?

1874
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:47,590
这些人都试图阻止商业之王
The people are trying to stop President Business...

1875
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:49,720
使用克拉格
...from using the Kragle.

1876
01:27:50,550 --> 01:27:51,890
什么是克拉格？
What's the Kragle?

1877
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:55,350
额  在那里
Um, it's in there.

1878
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:59,020
在这？
In here?

1879
01:28:25,180 --> 01:28:26,970
严禁靠近

1880
01:28:28,980 --> 01:28:30,770
严禁触摸

1881
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:34,770
别动手摸

1882
01:28:36,980 --> 01:28:40,770
商业之王就是坏人吧？
So President Business is the bad guy?

1883
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:49,990
如果
If...

1884
01:28:51,450 --> 01:28:53,950
如果这个建筑师
If the construction guy...

1885
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:56,740
要对商业之王说些什么
...said something to President Business...

1886
01:29:00,710 --> 01:29:02,460
他会说什么呢
...what would he say?

1887
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:10,430
你
You...

1888
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:14,100
你没必要去做
...don't have to be...

1889
01:29:15,010 --> 01:29:16,350
坏人
...the bad guy.

1890
01:29:18,890 --> 01:29:19,560
你
You...

1891
01:29:20,350 --> 01:29:22,100
是这个世界上最具天赋
...are the most talented...

1892
01:29:23,150 --> 01:29:24,480
最风趣
...most interesting...

1893
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:29,190
以及最杰出的人
...and most extraordinary person in the universe.

1894
01:29:30,820 --> 01:29:33,990
而且你拥有令人惊艳的能力
And you are capable of amazing things...

1895
01:29:34,740 --> 01:29:38,490
因为你是救世主
...because you are The Special.

1896
01:29:41,870 --> 01:29:43,210
我也是
And so am I.

1897
01:29:46,170 --> 01:29:47,880
每个人都是
And so is everyone.

1898
01:29:49,340 --> 01:29:51,380
预言既是编造出来的
The prophecy is made-up...

1899
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:54,050
也是真实的

因为它是关于我们所有人的

此时此刻  说的是你
