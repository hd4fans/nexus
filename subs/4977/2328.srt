1
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:18,568
好的 来看看我们在哪
Okay. Let's see where we are.

2
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:22,823
我们可以移开这个 丢掉那个 弄掉那个
We could move this, get
rid of that, kill that.

3
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:27,491
我有点被吓到了 不需要她 那个也弄掉
That kind of freaks me out. Don't need her.
We can get rid of that.

4
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,993
搞定 好了 我们可以就这样开始了
That's done. Okay, we could start with this.

5
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:33,204
我知道这很有难度 但是大家伙儿 这就是网络
I know it's a hard-hitting piece,
but come on, you guys, it's the Internet.

6
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,581
我们需要流量 流量 更多流量 你有什么想法
We need traffic, traffic, traffic.
What do you got?

7
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:38,293
- 这个怎么样        - 完美
- How about this?  - It's perfect.

8
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,791
现在 她看起来足够有脑去搞定移民法案吗
Now, doesn't she look smart and
knowledgeable about immigration reform?

9
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,801
- 是      -是 是 她确实是的 对吧
- Yeah.   - Yeah, yeah. She does, right?

10
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:45,216
我逗你们玩呢 这不是成人网站
I'm fucking with you people.
This isn't a porn site.

11
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,968
我们是什么 到处找咪咪看的宅男吗
What are we, nerds trying to look at boobies?

12
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,841
继续看
Come on, Keep looking.

13
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,343
靠 哈喽
Shit! Hello?

14
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,929
嘿 宝贝 你在哪 还在工作吗
Hey! Baby, where are you? Are you still at work?

15
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:55,348
压根没呢
No! Not even close.

16
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,932
你知道吧 电影还有10分钟就开演了
Just so you know,
the movie starts in 10 minutes.

17
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,813
- 我知道 给我你的裤子          - 啥
- I know! Give me your pants. - What?

18
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:00,527
- 明天请你吃午饭 赶紧的                  - 不要
- I'll buy you lunch tomorrow. Come on. - No.

19
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:02,484
我是你老板 给我你的裤子
I'm your boss. Give me your pants.

20
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:05,032
请别迟到 我可不喜欢错过片头
Please try not to be late.
I really hate missing the beginning.

21
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:06,279
我知道 我知道
I know. I know.

22
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:09,779
给我你的裤子 我来了 宝贝
Give me your pants. I'm coming, baby.

23
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:11,780
马上就到了
I'm almost there!

24
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:14,287
- 还有多远       - 好像我都看见你了
- How far away?  - I think I see you!

25
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,003
- 你在哪啊 我在这           - 我也在
- Where are you? I'm here.  - So am I.

26
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,921
人真多 你穿的什么啊
So many people. What are you wearing?

27
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,466
我是影院外唯一穿着衣服的人
I'm wearing the only clothes
outside the theater,

28
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,294
因为外头就我一个人!
because I'm the only person
outside the theater!

29
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,508
我爱你这身打扮 看起来太性感了
I love that outfit.
You look so sexy in that.

30
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,131
你知道我很喜欢这部电影
You know that I love this movie.

31
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:32,969
如果一个妓女和一个无情的商人能坠入爱河
If a prostitute and a ruthless businessman
can fall in love,

32
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:34,891
那又有谁不能呢
then anyone can.

33
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,143
我知道这对你意义重大 所以对我也是
I know this means a lot to you,
which means it means a lot to me.

34
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,644
哼 明显对你不是
Well, apparently it doesn't.

35
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:40,067
我正看着你呢 可以看见你了
I'm looking at you right now.
I can see you!

36
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:41,481
Jamie
Jamie!

37
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,232
嘿
Hey!

38
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,526
- 嘿     - 你赶上了
- Hey.   - You made it.

39
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,399
- 是啊 嘿     - 嗨
- Yeah. Hey.  - Hi.

40
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,985
- 抱歉我迟到了    - 没事 我买了三明治
- Sorry I'm late. - It's okay. I got us sandwiches.

41
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:52,412
给你买了无谷蛋白火鸡面包 不含奶酪
I got you turkey, no cheese,
gluten-free bread.

42
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,494
你确定这里边不含坚果吧
You sure this was prepared
in a nut-free facility?

43
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,830
是的 我很了解我们的过敏史
Yes, I'm full aware of our allergies.

44
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:00,838
嘿 我来了 我来了 我很抱歉
Hey, I'm here! I'm here. I'm really sorry.

45
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,665
我们错过了<<你的身体是仙境>>
We missed Your Body Is a Wonderland.

46
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,716
好吧 一首歌而已 也不是很糟糕呀
Okay. Only one song.
That's not so bad, right?

47
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,210
这可是他妈的<<你的身体是仙境>>啊
It was fucking Your Body ls a Wonderland!

48
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:10,181
呃 好消息是他还有其他好歌啊
Well, the good news is,
he has so many good ones.

49
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,975
这样吧 下次别给我玩迟到 直接拉炮屎在我脸上更好
Here's an idea: next time, instead
of being late, just shit on my face.

50
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,725
因为这和错过<<你的身体是仙境>>是同一种感觉啊
'Cause that's kind of the same thing
as missing Your Body ls a Wonderland.

51
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:17,971
好啦 来吧 我们得赶紧进去了
Okay, come on. We really gotta go in.

52
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:20,274
茱莉亚罗伯茨要穿上她的长筒靴了
Julia Roberts is about to put on
her really tall boots.

53
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,397
我们得谈谈
We need to talk.

54
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:28,698
我们暂时分开一下吧
I think we should take a break.

55
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:31,118
我感觉 我们得分开一阵子 你知道吗
I just feel like we should chill for a while, you know?

56
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:32,991
- 你确定要这么做吗        - 要跟我分手吗
- You're doing this? - You're breaking up with me?

57
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,413
你说过我是你的灵魂伴侣
You said I was your soul mate.

58
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,743
有吗 什么时候
I did? When?

59
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,333
当我们在床上边吃早餐边做爱的时候
When we were at that bed and breakfast
having sex.

60
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,910
- 但是 你知道的 那并不...         - 并不什么
- But, you know, that doesn't... - That doesn't what?

61
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:43,206
- 不算   - 我工作实在很忙 我很抱歉
- Count. - I was tied up at work. I'm sorry.

62
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,625
或许你应该少关心点工作
Maybe you should care
a little bit less about work

63
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,926
多关心关心你正在交往的女孩
and a little more
about the girl that you're dating.

64
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:51,430
因为据我所知 工作不能保证你
'Cause last time I checked,
work doesn't reassure you

65
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:54,015
喜欢被人从后面捅并且还不是基佬
that liking a finger up your ass
doesn't make you gay.

66
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,935
我没让你往里捅啊
I never said "go up." Okay?

67
00:02:57,052 --> 00:03:00,431
我只说了轻轻的在周围就好
I just said lightly around...
It's like a little button.

68
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,432
我告诉你 这不关你的事了
You know what? Not your issue any more.

69
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,683
这就是你为什么迟到吗
Is this why you were late?

70
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,269
你一直在想怎么跟我分手吗
You were worried
about how to break up with me?

71
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,738
没 没 我在犹豫穿什么衣服好
Oh, no, no. I was trying to decide what to wear.

72
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,069
- 所以你就穿着连帽衫和运动鞋来了            - 是呀
- So, you went with sneakers and a hoodie. - Yeah.

73
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:11,905
完了你还打算这身打扮去参加体育生高考测试还是怎么着
What, are you gonna
take the SATs after this?

74
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,819
别发飙嘛 好吗
Don't lash out, okay?

75
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,620
- 你是个好妹子              - 姐才不是
- You're better than that. - I'm really not.

76
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,410
我只是觉得我们渐行渐远
I just think
we're heading in different directions.

77
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,912
是啊 你去了约翰梅尔的音乐会 而我没去
Yeah, you to the John Mayer concert
and me not.

78
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,419
顺便感谢你在音乐会开始之前跟我分手了 
Thank you for doing this
before the concert, by the way.

79
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,496
有史以来最棒的分手
Best breakup ever.

80
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,757
他就是我们这个时代的雪儿克罗
(90年代以来最受欢迎的摇滚乐女歌手之一)
He is the Sheryl Crow of our generation!

81
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,167
我能问你个简单的问题吗
Let me just ask you a quick question.

82
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,255
顺便告诉你 分手了我也完全不会伤心
And just know that I am not at all
crushed by this breakup.

83
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,260
所以 诚实点告诉我 为什么要分手
So, be honest. Why?

84
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,636
- 等等 这是什么诡计吗     - 不是
- Wait, is this a trick? - No.

85
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,600
只是单纯的人类学研究
Just pure anthropological research.

86
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,682
好吧 你想找人谈恋爱
Okay. You want someone
to sweep you off your feet,

87
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,560
但是你只对谈恋爱本身有兴趣
but you're more interested
in getting swept off your feet

88
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,856
而不是和人谈恋爱的人
than the someone who's doing the sweeping.

89
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,150
表面上你以为都能处理得很好
You seem like you've got
it totally together,

90
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:48,111
实际上感情却很受伤
but you're actually
really emotionally damaged.

91
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:51,656
然后你的那双大眼睛有时候着实会吓到我
Also, you have, like, really big eyes,
and that freaks me out sometimes...

92
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,867
谢谢 理由很充分
Thank you. That's enough.

93
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,410
分手完全不是因为你
It is not you at all.

94
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,614
当然是我 你不正和我分手吗
Of course it's me! You can't say that.
You're breaking up with me!

95
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,492
不是 是我的原因 我不再喜欢你了
It's not. It's me.
I don't like you any more.

96
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,994
这是我的错 你应该得到比我更好的男友
This is my fault.
You deserve better than me.

97
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,336
你是个好人 
You're a great guy.

98
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:08,754
只是有点不会把握感情 如果你问我的话
A little too emotionally unavailable,
if you ask me.

99
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,879
我没问
I didn't.

100
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,210
我很想做回普通朋友
I really want to stay friends.

101
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:12,795
- 那就做朋友吧        - 好啊
- Let's stay friends. - Sure.

102
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,050
完全没问题
Totally.

103
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:17,178
约翰梅尔
John Mayer.

104
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,510
约翰梅尔我来啦!
John fucking Mayer!

105
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,477
过来
Come here, you.

106
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,147
你会没事的
You're gonna get through this.

107
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:31,322
为什么感情开始时都是那么有趣 接着就变得这么操蛋了呢
Why do relationships always start off so
fun and then turn into suck-a-bag-o-dicks?

108
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:35,651
我真不能再相信这种充满好莱坞式陈词滥调的真爱故事了
I really have to stop buying into this
bullshit Hollywood cliché of true love.

109
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,537
闭嘴 凯瑟琳 海格尔 你这愚蠢的骗子
Shut up, Katherine Heigl! You stupid liar!

110
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,828
以后我只管工作和做爱 就像乔治克鲁尼那样
I'm just gonna work and fuck.
Like George Clooney.

111
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,665
我要把自己的感情封闭起来
I'm just gonna
shut myself down emotionally.

112
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,002
就像乔治克鲁尼
Like George Clooney.

113
00:04:58,507 --> 00:04:59,554
哈喽
Hello.

114
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,180
请坐直 先生
Seat up, please, sir.

115
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,011
那是哈德逊河吗
Is that the Hudson River?

116
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,893
不是 那是东河
No. It's the East River.

117
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:10,027
那我们不会降落在上面吧
So we won't be landing on it, then,
like that flight,

118
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:13,272
就像被授予勋章的飞行员开的那架一样
you know, with that captain
they keep giving medals to?

119
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:15,945
那个飞行员是个英雄
That pilot was a hero.

120
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,535
混蛋
Asshole.

121
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,864
飞机真是事多
Plane actually did a lot of the work.

122
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,876
我想我找到了适合GQ杂志那份工作的完美人选
I think I found the perfect guy
to fill that job at GQ.

123
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,208
没 他提早到了 我正争分夺秒赶过去呢
No, he's landing early. I'm scrambling.

124
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,458
没 他还没接下工作呢 但是我会把他带过来的 放心
No, he's not sold on the job yet,
but I'll get him there. I always do.

125
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,801
我现在还穿的一身休闲装呢 
I'm even picking him up in a hybrid.

126

You're not exactly what comes to mind
when you think headhunter.

00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:04,182
是啊 我更喜欢"招聘主管"这个词 猎头听着有点恐怖
Yeah, I prefer "executive recruiter."
Headhunter sounds a little creepy.

155
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,802
你跟踪我六个月 这才恐怖呢
You did stalk me for six months.
Kind of creepy.

Oh, really? 'Cause you wouldn't be here
if your life were already pretty great.

161
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,326
我才不会傻到拒绝免费游纽约 
A free trip to New York.
I'd be an idiot to turn that down.

呃 那之前六个月你都是傻子了呀
Well, then I guess you must have been
an idiot for the past six months.

163
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,533
是啊 还有人说我傻得更久呢

放一个我用咪咪搅蛋糕糊的视频在博客上
I could put up a video of me mixing
cake batter with my boobs

169
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,547
我就能赚到八百万点击率呢
and it will get eight million hits.

170

what's really worrying you about this?

178
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:10,202
不知道 我不想一下子得到爬得很高很高
I don't know. I don't want to be the guy
who took something legendary

179
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:13,034
我怕摔得会很惨

00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:16,087
好吧 那就别摔下来啊 
Well, then don't be the guy who shit the bed.
Excuse the expression.

Be the guy
who made the bed legendary again.

Listen, we'll get some coffee in you
before the interview. You'll be fine.

00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:28,805
抱歉 不喝咖啡 还是喝点绿茶 抽根大麻的好
I'm sorry, not coffee.
Some green tea, soy, organic hemp bullshit.

184
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:30,927
纽约真热
Really hot in New York.

洛杉矶不热吗

是啊 洛杉矶也热 但是因为湿度的原因
Yeah, it gets hot in LA,
but it's the humidity.

187
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,396
在洛杉矶 如果是90度 那感觉起来就是90度 但是
In LA, if it's 90 degrees,
it feels like 90 degrees. But...

188
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,936

202
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,239
他们信了 你还能安全一阵子
They bought it.

Congratulations. Offer expires at midnight.

208
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,137
为什么你不亲口告诉我反而要发短信呢
Why didn't you just tell me
instead of texting me?

209
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,642
因为更具有戏剧性啊
'Cause it's more dramatic.

210
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,976
Dylan 你能胜任的

But for New York? Yeah, I would.

216
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,370
我没让你去接受这份工作
Which is why I'm not gonna
try to sell you on the job,

217
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:13,739
而是要让你接受纽约城

You don't fucking know me, man!
Don't talk to me like you know me!

268

好吧 这不是宋飞正传
Okay, this was not on Seinfeld.

298
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,881
说说 你老爸会怎么想
Come on,
what's your dad think about all this?

299
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,419
关于什么
About what?

300
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,669
他应该会有评价吧
Well, he must have an opinion.

301
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,847
他曾给洛杉矶时报供稿23年
He used to write for the LA Times
for 23 years.

302
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,341
某人功课做得很足哦
Somebody did their homework.

303
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:05,679
我有个叫谷歌的工具
I have this thing at work.
It's called Google.

304
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,935
他怎么会看待你这份工作
Come on, what's he think about the job?

305
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,190
事实上我没问他
Actually, I didn't ask him.

306
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,230
那你应该知道他会怎么说
Well, then you must know what he'd say.

307
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:21,362
他会告诉我 鼓起勇气去闯 无论我做什么他都会为我骄傲
He'd tell me to go with my gut and that
he'd be proud of me no matter what I did.

308
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,914
像是个不错的人
Sounds like a really great man.

309
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,080
是啊
Yeah, he is.

310
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,878
嘿 想看好东西吗
Hey, do you want to
see something really cool?

311
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,464
我从来都喜欢看很酷的东西 是什么呢
I always want to see something really cool.
What...

312
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:34,962

Come on.

313
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,589
好吧
Okay.

314
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,261
整个城市里只有这能真正看到星星
Only place in the city
you can actually see the stars.

315
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,433
- 哇   - 恩
- Wow. - Yeah.

316
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,769
- 太酷了               - 是啊
- It's pretty awesome. - I know.

317
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,147
我喜欢来这上面思考
I like to come up here to think.

318
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:52,107
当下面生活压的我有点透不过气的时候 它就像... 
Just when it gets a little too much
for me down there, it's like...

319
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,485
就像纽约版的山顶
It's like my New York version
of a mountaintop.

320
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,155
最好的一点是 不用接手机
Best part, no cell reception.

321
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,819
每个你招募到的人你都会带到这来吗
You take all your recruits up here?

322
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,282
说真的我还没带任何人上来过
Actually, never really
taken anyone up here.

323
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,459
- 真的吗    - 是啊
- Really?  - Yeah.

324
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:11,081
谢谢
Thanks.

325
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,413
如果你跟人谈今天的事 我就把你的耳朵切下来
If you tell anyone about this,
I will rip your ears off

326
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,248
然后钉在你脖子上
and staple them to your neck.

327
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,176
整个城市的人都好暴力啊
Everyone in this city seems really violent.

328
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,801
来吧 我们走 最后一站
Come on, let's go. One last stop.

329
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:25,509
- 我刚感觉舒服一点了呢
- 我知道 赶紧的 老兄
- We're just getting comfortable.
- I know you are. Come on, buddy.

330
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,977
这是纽约啊 给我赶紧的 
It's New York. Now hustle. Come on.

331
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,730
- 快点快点          - 你带我来看时代广场啊
- Come on, come on. - You're showing me Times Square.

332
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:33,183
- 一点都不好玩啊              -闭嘴
- This is not touristy at all! - Would you shush? Come on.

333
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,605
我们必须到哪都这么走这么快吗
Do we have to power-walk
everywhere we go?

334
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:36,982
是的
Yes.

335
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:40,900
每个人想到哪就去哪喽
So everybody just kind of walks
wherever they want, then.

336
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,030
就这怎么样
How 'bout right here?

337
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,702
- 啥意思            - 到了 就这
- What do you mean? - We're here.

338
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:52,168
噢 老天 1988年的歌啊
Oh, my God, it's 1988.

339
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,499
好了 小聪明 等一会儿
All right, smartass, give it five seconds.

340
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,731
- 这是什么       - 快闪族啊
- What is this?  - It's a flash mob.

341
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,318
- 像奥普拉秀      - 确实
- Like on Oprah! - Exactly.

342
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,031
我们要让开来吗
Should we get out of the way?

343
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,246
不 不 好好享受吧 
No, no. Enjoy it. Take it all in.

344
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,246
- 真他喵的酷             - 是吧
- It's pretty damn cool. - Right?

345
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,377
酷毙了
It's kind of rad.

346
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,376
这些人这么做有钱拿吗
Do these people get paid for this?

347
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,259
没 他们这么做只是为了好玩
No. No. They kind of just do it for fun.

348
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,178
身上其中的快乐感觉真不错
It's nice to feel
like you're a part of something.

349
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,225
在纽约其实有时候也会很孤独
New York can be a little
bit lonely at times.

350
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,012
那你还让我来纽约啊
And you're trying to sell me on it.

351
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:55,390
无论哪里有时候都会感觉孤独啊
Every place can be a bit lonely sometimes.

352
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:01,730
- 当心       - 老天
- Be careful! - Oh, my God.

353
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,572
- 蹲下来       - 好的
- Come down. - Okay.

354
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,408
- 靠 弯腰              - 好的
- Shit. Get back down. - Okay.

355
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,882
- 我加入 - 啥
- I'm in.  - What?

356
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,381
- 你舒服我了      - 真的?
- You sold me.  - Really?

357
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,137
- 我接受这份工作     - 噢 天哪
- I'll take the job. - Oh, my God!

- What, are you surprised?

360
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:41,277
- 大家可以回家了 谢谢你们           - 真有趣
- You can all go home now! Thank you! - Very funny.

361
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,441
来
Come on.

362
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,277
恭喜
Congratulations, sell-out!

363
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,775
谢谢 谢谢
Thank you, thank you.

364
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,160
我想说的是 飞机在河上迫降
All I'm saying is,
it wasn't so much the pilot's skill

365
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:52,247
比起飞行员的技术 飞机本身的性能也很关键
that landed that plane on the river
as much as the mechanics of the aircraft.

366
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,744
你意思是Sully机长并非英雄
Are you saying
that Captain Sully wasn't a hero?

367
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,121
不 不是
No, no.

368
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:57,956
还有各方面的因素啊
There were just other factors.

369
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,962
你不是美国人吗
Are you not an American?

370
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,306
嘿 混蛋 你倒是赶紧把你的东西从我车上拿走啊
Hey, fuckface, you want to get your shit
out of my car or what?

371
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,932
我...好的
I... Yeah.

372
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,149
欢迎来到纽约 擦你妹的...
Welcome to New York. Go and fuck a dick.

373
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,791
擦
Fuck.

374
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:49,470
那么 我要求的只是你们大家给我一点时间来赢得你们的信任
So, all I ask is that you give me
a little bit of time to gain your trust.

375
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:54,176
我知道我是个新来的 但是我会用陈词滥调来弥补我的经验不足
I know that I'm new at this, but what I lack
in experience I make up for in cliches.

376
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:55,844
所以 我的门永远都是开着的
So, my door is always open.

377
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:01,353
严肃的来讲 我的门想关都关不上
But seriously, my door is always open.

378
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:07,238
我生意上的第一个订单就是 一扇轻点的门
My first order of business, lighter doors.

379

Listen, I'd love to take you out one night
and troll for cock.

384
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,589

- What? - You got some pretty boys out there in LA,

385
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:28,380
但是纽约的小伙子质量更棒啊
but the quality in this town is ridiculous.

386
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,552
我们一起去见识下
We can tear this shit up.

387
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,217
我不是基 Tommy
I'm not gay, Tommy.

想听听你对于字体上有什么好的想法
Love to get your concepts on the font.

392
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:47,445
我需要好的建议
I'm thinking Helvetica
but I could be persuaded to Courier New.

393
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,781
我自己又知道些什么呢 我只是个运动版的编辑
But what the fuck do I know?
I'm just the sports editor.

394
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,909
- 你确定你不是基?           -确定..

I'd knock, but you don't have a door.

399
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,163
- 没有     - 没
- I don't. - No.

400
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,418

But it'd be even more awesome
if this happened.

405
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,265
等着
Wait for it.

406
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:22,184

407

我跟一个快闪族组织者联系过了
I got in touch with a guy
who puts flash mobs together.

408
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,817
我们要借用他们来做游击式广告
We're thinking about using them
for guerrilla advertising.

409
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,271
把单纯的东西加以商业化利用?
Taking something so pure
and commercializing it?

410
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,064
就知道我找对了人
Knew I found the right guy.

好的
Okay.

414
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:39,955
一整年?
A whole year?

415
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,914
为什么我觉得这是你的第一份工作
Why do I get the feeling this is the first
real commitment you've ever made?

416
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,416
不是啊 我曾在T-Mobile工作了两年
It's not. T-Mobile, two years.

417
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,667
靠 我真后悔那两年
And, fuck, do I regret that one.

418
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,299
帮帮忙 别一年之内就辞职或者被炒掉
Do me a favor. Don't quit or get
fired before the year's up,

419
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,838
因为那样我就得不到额外奖金了
because otherwise I don't get my bonus.

420
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,336
等等 我想走就能走?
Wait, I can leave whenever I want?

421
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,138
- 那这份合同有什么意义
- 你就赶紧签了吧
- What's the point of this contract?
- Just sign the damn thing.

422
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,469

Hey, I was thinking of getting some lunch.
Do you know a place?

425

你这是要约我出去吗
Are you asking me out?

426
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,446
呃 不是

427
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,693
只是想让你带我去个餐馆
I'm asking you to show me a restaurant.

428
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,441
我是你在纽约唯一的朋友
I mean, I'm the only friend you have
in New York.

429
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,777
- 你不想把关系复杂化吧
- 我知道 我不是要和你约会
- You don't wanna complicate that.
- I know. I'm not asking you out.

430
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,862
我意思是 当然 我们能到处找乐子
I mean, sure, we'd have fun, roll around,

431
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,160
- 然后开始想着上床                        - 上床?
- get into some erotic humiliation fantasy. - Erotic?

432
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,626
但是最终糟糕收场 从此形同陌路
But it'd all blow up in our faces, end badly,
and we'd never speak to each other again.

433
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,328
我他妈的不是想约会你! 我发誓
I'm not fucking asking you out!
I swear to God!

434
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,706
好吧 你不喜欢我
Okay. You don't like me like that.

435
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,999
那你也不用这么凶吧
You don't have to be so mean about it.

436
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:34,965
对不起 我不是那意思...
I'm sorry. I didn't...

437
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,514
天哪 你真像个女孩子 走吧 我请客
God, you're such a girl.
Come on, it's my treat.

438
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:41,676
来纽约工作没那么难吧
So was it an easy move?

439
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,685
- 难的是要离开我老爸           - 是啊
- It was tough leaving my dad. - Yeah.

440
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,146
我姐姐说了一大堆

of my emotional unavailability.

- You're emotionally unavailable?  - Oh, yeah.

Oh, my God. I'm emotionally damaged.
I haven't seen you at the meetings.

我不想再谈什么感情了

452
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,380
是爱情的陷阱
"Preaching to the choir." You're supposed
to preach to the congregation.

453
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,428
- 要这么说才对
- 我懂我意思就行了
- That's the expression.
- Did you understand what I was saying?

454

00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:26,609
我爱那让你潸然泪下的夕阳
I love that sunsets make you cry

508
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:30,078
我不管你是否挂掉了房地产考试
and I don't care that you failed
your real estate exam,

509
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,619
我很高兴你有约会5次的原则
and I'm glad that you
have a five-date rule.

510
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,784
我爱你
And that I love you.

511
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,957
我更爱你
Not as much as I love you.

512
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,587
第五轨道爱情列车的乘客请上车
Now boarding, track 5, love.

513
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,427
天哪 我有时真希望我的生活也能像电影般美好
God, I wish my life was a movie sometimes.

514
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,551
我从来不需要为我的头发担心
You know, I'd never have to worry
about my hair,

515
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,389
也不用担心要去卫生间
or having to go to the bathroom.

516
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,976
然后 当我处在人生最低谷时
And then, when I'm at my lowest point,

517
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:55,433
会有人狂奔整条街到我面前 向我表白
some guy would chase me down the street,
pour his heart out,

518
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:56,643
然后我们就接吻
and we'd kiss.

519
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:58,816
从此幸福快乐
Happily ever after.

520
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,607
坐着四轮马车
I mean, a horse and carriage?

521
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,774
这太棒了
Come on, that is awesome.

522
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:08,367
那也比不上这首歌词含糊不清并且跟情节撘不上边的
Not as awesome as this
ambiguously upbeat pop song

523
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:10,069
的欢快嘻哈歌曲吧
that has nothing to do with the plot

524
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:14,908
他们把它放在最后 好让相信你度过了90分钟快乐时光
they put in at the end to try to convince you
that you had a great time at this shitty movie.

525
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,953
你知道为什么他们就从来不接着拍接吻之后的戏吗
You know, why don't they ever make a movie
about what happens after the big kiss?

526
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,250
拍的啊 那叫AV
They do. It's called porn.

527
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:24,250
天哪 我真怀念做爱的感觉
God, I miss sex.

528
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:27,628
是吧 我意思是 有时候人需要性爱 就像是
Right? I mean, sometimes you just need it.
It's like...

529
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,639
我不知道 就像是在拧脖子
I don't know, it's like cracking your neck.

530
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,800
为什么性爱总要伴随着其他并发症呢
Why does it always gotta
come with complications?

531
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,802
- 比如感情      - 还有罪恶感
- And emotions. - And guilt.

532
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,303
罪恶感
Guilt.

533
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,681
- 那是女人的错        - 什么?
- It's women's fault. - What?

534
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:42,522
你没听错 "抱着我 让我们一起白头偕老"
You heard me. "Hold me.
Let's spend the rest of our lives together."

535
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:44,020
噢 得了吧 你也好不到哪去
Oh, please, you are no better.

536
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:47,983
"噢 耶 宝贝 叫我的名字 耶"
"Oh, yeah, baby, come on, now.
Say my name. Yeah..."

537
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:50,693
"我到高潮了 我表现如何"?
"I'm done. How was I?"

538
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:51,819
你跟谁这样过?
Who have you been with?

539
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,825
为什么就不能不是那样呢
Why can't it not be like that?

540
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:59,368
这是生理反应 就像打网球
It's a physical act. Like playing tennis.

541
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:02,046
两个人就应该就打网球那样做爱
Two people should be able to have sex
like they're playing tennis.

542
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,960
是 我意思是 没人愿意打完网球之后
Yeah, I mean, no one wants to
go away for the weekend

543
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,336
离开一个星期
after they play tennis.

544
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,711
只是一场游戏 握握手 继续自己的生活
It's just a game.
You shake hands, get on with your shit.

545
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,174
- 是啊  - 是啊
- Yeah. - Yeah.

546
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:13,890
还要喝啤酒吗
Do you want more beer?

547
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:16,014
恩
Okay.

548
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:24,817
- Jamie   - 恩?
- Jamie!  - Yeah?

549
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,112
- 我们来打网球吧      - 啥?
- Let's play tennis.  - What?

550
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,564
我们来做爱吧 就跟打网球一样
Let's have sex like we're playing tennis.

551
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:29,906
别开玩笑
Get the hell out of here.

552
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,694
别笑 这也许会很棒
Don't laugh. This could be great.

553
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,407
也许能消除所有的尴尬
This could take all the
weirdness out of it.

554
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,951
我们谈过的 我不是那种意义上的喜欢你
Well, we talked about this.
I don't like you like that.

555
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,579
我也不是啊 这就是为什么我们的关系很完美
I don't like you like that either.
That's why it's perfect.

556
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:42,499
我都不知道你是否足够有魅力
I don't even know if I find you attractive.

557
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:43,704
做作
That's cute.

558
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,422
好吧 我有对付混蛋的方法
Well, I do have a thing for jerks.

559
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,167
好吧 那你觉得我有魅力吗
Okay, well, do you even find me attractive?

560
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,672
- 别做作了      - 不 不 不是
- That's cute.  - No, no, no.

561
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,220
在你见识我的人格魅力之前
Before you got to know
my awesome personality.

562
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,380
我的身体魅力如何
Strictly physical.

563
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:55,678
第一眼你见到我的时候
First time you saw me.

564
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,223
- 就我们两个讨论这事吧              - 是
- This is just two people talking?  - Yeah.

565
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,724
两个在Bennigan's喝醉的女孩  说吧
Two girls over drinks at Bennigan's. Go.

566
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:07,395
我喜欢你的眼睛 我从来没坚果这么大这么美的眼睛
I liked your eyes. I didn't think
I'd ever seen such big, beautiful eyes.

567
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,529
你的嘴唇 是的 我想你应该是个接吻高手
Your lips. Yeah.
I thought you might be a good kisser.

568
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,031
我是
I am.

569
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,904
- 你的胸部       - 怎么样
- Your breasts.  - What about them?

570
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,326
- 我被他们迷住了      - 真的吗
- They intrigued me.  - Really?

571
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,703
- 是的   - 我觉得他们太小了
- Yeah.  - I think they're so tiny.

572
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,747
- 小归小 但还是胸部啊       - 谢谢
- They're still breasts.   - Thanks.

573
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,454
- 我喜欢你的手         - 嘴
- I liked your hands.  - Mouth.

574
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:26,834
- 臀部     - 声音
- Butt     - Voice.

575
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:27,961
- 胸膛   - 双眼
- Chest. - Eyes.

576
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,628
- 你说过了        - 我认真的
- You said that.  - I meant it.

577
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,760
你发誓除了做爱 不会对我再有其他想法了
You swear you don't want anything more
from me other than sex?

578
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,599
你发誓你不想从我这得到更多
You swear you don't want anything
more from me?

579
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:41,266
我知道你们女孩子
I know how you girls get.
Tick-took, tick-took.

580
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,433
停
Stop it.

581
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:47,443
- 你要干嘛             - 拿出我的IPAD圣经
- What are you doing?  - I'm pulling up my Bible app.

582
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,400
- 你有IPAD圣经?          - 是的 我是个好女孩
- You have a Bible app?  - Yes. I am a good girl.

583
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:51,776
- 手放上来            - 好的
- Hand on the iPad.   - Okay.

584
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,277
等等 不
Wait, no.

585
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,612
怎么他们就不能搞定这个
Why can't they figure this out?

586
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:58,112
不 这玩意弄不清楚我跟你谁是谁了
No... This thing thinks
I'm you and you're me.

587
00:28:58,237 --> 00:28:59,705
你手别动 我来调位置
Keep your hand still. I'll move the iPad.

588
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,123
- 这让我感觉有点晕                 - 坚持住
- It's actually making me dizzy.  - Hold on.

589
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:03,666
搞定了
There we go.

590
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,456
没有情人关系
No relationship.

591
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,003
不谈感情
No emotions.

592
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,751
就为了性
Just sex.

593
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,462
不管怎样 我们都是朋友
Whatever happens, we stay friends.

594
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,927
- 发誓    - 发誓
- Swear.  - Swear.

595
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,307
好了
Okay.

596
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,318
我觉得我们该开始了
So I guess we should just start.

597
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:32,817
好
Okay.

598
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:34,982
我先来
I'll serve.

599
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:37,405
这有点...  网球什么的够了
That's really...
That's enough of the tennis.

600
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:38,576
我们去卧室吧
Let's go to the bedroom.

601
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:40,654
沙发不行吗 比在床上更不会有感情
What's wrong with the couch?
It's less emotional.

602
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,122
卧室灯光好一点
The bedroom has better light.

603
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:44,913
正因为我们是朋友 我不需要为了我的身体而感到不安
And since we're just friends,
I don't have to be insecure about my body.

604
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:46,994
噢 你很美
Come on, okay? You're beautiful.

605
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,167
你没必要感到不安
You have nothing to be insecure about.

606
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:53,209
不 你看 这太感情化了
No, you see,
that is way too emotionally supportive

607
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,301
你必须封闭它
and you need to just lock that down.

608
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:59,640
- 你的屁股真小                - 哪有
- Your ass is a little bony.  - Much better.

609
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,684
我的胸部很敏感 我不喜欢听下流情话
My nipples are sensitive,
I don't like dirty talk,

610
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,805
早知道要这样 我就早上先把腿刮干净了
and had I known this was gonna happen,
I would have shaved my legs this morning.

611
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,436
我下巴很怕痒 有时候还会打喷嚏
My chin is ticklish,
I sneeze sometimes after I come,

612
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,983
早知道这样
and if I'd have known
this was gonna happen,

613
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,275
我就不会早上刮腿毛了
I wouldn't have shaved
my legs this morning.

614
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,523
好拉
Okie-dokie.

615
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,153
我要穿着袜子 有亲密感
I keep my socks on. Intimacy issues.

616
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,155
正好 因为我讨厌脚 老爸弄的
Great, 'cause feet gross me out.
Daddy issues.

617
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,577
很好
Great.

618
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:25,995
还行
I can work with that.

619
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:29,916
应该可以
Should be fine.

620
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:34,250
真不敢相信我这么做了
I can't believe I'm doing this.

621
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,301
要不别做了 出去跑个步
Should we stop? We could just go for a run.

622
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,923
我不知道 这么做会不会显得太老
I don't know, are we
getting too old for this?

623
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:40,597
- 做爱?    - 不 一夜情
- Sex?     - No, casual sex.

624
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:43,433
不知道 有点像回到大学时代
It just, I don't know,
feels a little collegey.

625
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:45,560
- 我来唱首歌吧                         - 行
- I could sing some Third Eye Blind.  - Okay.

626
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,475
- 你这唱的什么啊
- 歌啊
- That's not Third Eye Blind.
- I'm pretty sure that's Third Eye Blind.

627
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:52,605
不是
Nope.

628
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,573
- 怎么了          - 我们就只做一次
- What's wrong?   - We're just doing this once.

629
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,862
- 完全同意         - 好的
- I totally agree. - Okay.

630
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,158
- 好      - 好的
- Great.  - Great.

631
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,451
加快速度
Little faster.

632
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,571
- 快              - 看着我的下巴
- More circular.  - Watch my chin.

633
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,080
- 咬我的耳朵       - 好的
- Touch my ears.  - Okay.

634
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:08,959
吻我的脖子
Kiss my neck.

635
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,628
- 叫我的名字    - 小Dylan Francis Harper
- Say my name. - Dylan Francis Harper Jr.

636
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:12,746
别叫全名啊
Not my full name.

637
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,088
不好意思 我
Sorry, I had to fill out
a lot of your paperwork.

638
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,253
- 别说话          - 好的
- Stop talking.  - Okay.

639
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,251
噢 天哪 你真是
Oh, my God, you're really...

640
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:24,593
....................
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I,
J, K, L, M, N, O, P...

641
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,060
- Dylan 我      - 放松
- Dylan, I...   - Relax.

642
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,308
朋友之间的性爱
Just a friend going down on another friend.

643
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,147
噢耶 宝贝 风卷残云
Oh, yeah, baby. Tornado.

644
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:36,441
啥跟啥啊
What, what?

645
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,697
你在干嘛 挖隧道呢
What are you trying to do?
Dig your way to China?

646
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:40,149
- 这个我很在行啊       - 谁说的
- I'm good at this.   - Says who?

647
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,616
跟我在一起的所有女孩子
Every girl I've been with.

648
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,111
好吧 要不她们说谎了 要不她们都是黑木耳了
Well, they're either lying
or their vaginas are made out of burlap.

649
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:46,120
放松 你又不是蜥蜴
So, relax. You're not a lizard.

650
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,948
- 好吧         - 好
- Okay, fine.  - Okay, fine.

651
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,244
- 往右一点                 - 好
- A little to the right.   - Okay.

652
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,079
- 再稍微往左一点                   - 收到
- A little bit more to the left.  - Roger that.

653
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,630
- 下来          - 来吧
- Now go down.  - Here we go.

654
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,258
- 
- A little more... Whoa, too far!
- Sorry.

655
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,257
- What's wrong?
- Nothing!

656
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,842
你这么一叫 我以为...
When women start to scream,
it could be misconstrued.

657
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:08,435
继续啊!
Just keep going!

658
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:19,025
耶 
Yeah, you know it.

659
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,823

Well, let me tell you how I like it.

660
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,746
See, most girls think
you should start off soft,

661
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:32,292
but if you just get in,
really go for it, ..

662
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,507
Yeah, you know it.

663
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:08,954
- 就用Obama吧          - 不 不 不
- Let's go with Obama.  - No, no, no, no!

664
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:11,873
这太简单没有内涵了 用Shaun吧 
It's too easy, too predictable.
Go with Shaun.

665
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:16,871
他像神一样诠释运动的完美 身材又那么棒
He's stylish, transcendent of sport,
has an ass like a kumquat.

666
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,873
- 我听说他是个混蛋             - 不 他不是
- I hear he's kind of a jerk.  - No, he's not.

667
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,087
他只是威胁过你嘛
You're just threatened by him

668
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,631
因为他是世界上最好的运动员
because he's the greatest snow
sport athlete in the universe

669
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,678
独领风骚
and he gets more squirrel than an oak tree.

670
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:27,927
嘿 Dylan    Jamie在大厅等你
Hey, Dylan?
Jamie Rellis is in the lobby for you.

671
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:29,095
好的 谢谢
Okay, thanks.

672
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,514
午饭后我们再谈好吗 
Let's hit this after lunch. Okay, guys?

673
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:34,180
没人对Obama感"性趣" 兄弟
Nobody wants to fuck Obama, brah.

674
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,605
瞧他那大象耳朵
He's got ears like an elephant.

675
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,895
又不是大象"鼻子"
That's not the part of
an elephant you want.

676
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:43,063
- 嗨    - 嗨
- Hi!   - Hi.

677
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,277
不好意思这么突然现身
Sorry to just show up like this.

678
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,569
不 不 没事
No, no, no, it's fine.

679
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:51,409
呃
So...

680
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,246
- 散不步?           - 好啊
- Wanna take a walk?  - Love to.

681
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,627
好的
Great. Okay.

682
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,713
关于昨晚发生的事 我....
Okay, so about what happened, I...

683
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,672
- 那太疯狂了 我们真不该那样的
- 确实不该
- It was crazy and we shouldn't have done it.
- Exactly. No, no, exactly.

684
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,006
我意思是 这太不像我风格了
I mean, it is so not me.

685
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:11,091
同意 我们忘掉它吧
I totally agree. Let's forget it happened.

686
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:14,762
好啊 你看 我们有了一夜情
Great. I mean, look,
I've had one-night stands.

687
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:18,106
不太光荣的一夜情 但是
We both have had one-night stands,
none of which we're proud of, but...

688
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:20,100
真的?
Really?

689
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,149
我们只是为了性
Look, to think that you and I
could just have sex

690
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,443
而没有爱 这样做..
and without it compromising anything
was just so...

691
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,903
- 是错误的     - 对
- Misguided.  - Exactly.

692
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,492
早上我打算给你打电话说的
I was gonna call you this morning.

693
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:30,781
但是你没有啊
But you didn't.

694
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:31,945
我没有
But I didn't.

695
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:34,285
你看 我们的关系已经不像以前了
And you see, it's already
coming between us and I really...

696
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:35,703
这不是我想要的
I just don't want it to.

697
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:36,829
不会的
It's not going to.

698
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,829
我表现很坚强 说话也很强硬 但是我..
Look, I know that I act all tough
and I talk all tough, but really...

699
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:42,752
只是为了掩饰你柔弱的内心
It's just a front to protect yourself
from your own vulnerability.

700
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:45,292
你是谁? 我的心理医生吗
What are you, my fucking therapist now?

701
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:50,097
不 我是你朋友 我知道你每次骂人都会眨眼
No, I'm a friend. Who knows that
every time you curse, you blink.

702
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:53,642
- 其实你不想骂人的                      - 没啊
- Like your body's rejecting the word. - It does not.

703
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,801
- 我靠         - 眨眼了
- Fuck you.   - Blinked.

704
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,644
- 我靠 我没眨眼                - 又眨了
- No, I didn't fucking blink.  - Blinked again.

705
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,430
- 擦       - 啊 这次没眨
- Shit.    - Ah, didn't blink.

706
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:00,106
说"擦"字还行
"Shit" you're okay with.

707
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,188
- 这太愚蠢了       - 是的
- It was stupid.  - Yes.

708
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:05,188
- 我们是朋友 一直做朋友
- 是啊 我可不想失去你这个朋友
- We're friends, let's stay friends.
- Yes. Yes, this, I don't wanna lose this.

709
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:06,438
我也不想
Me neither.

710
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:07,647
- 好       - 太棒了
- Great.   - Fantastic.

711
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,612
两位需要情侣画像吗
Portrait for the lovely couple?

712
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:19,785
- 我们这是在干嘛               - 我不知道
- What the hell are we doing?  - I don't know.

713
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:24,335
- 抚摸我的头发   - 吻我的脖子
- Rub my hair.   - Kiss my neck.

714
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:28,506
- 看着我的胸部       - 好 好
- Watch my nipple.  - All right, all right.

715
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:32,010
- 我不知道你还有纹身呢               - 是啊
- I didn't know you had a tattoo.  - Yeah.

716
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:33,465
怎么以前我没注意到
Why didn't I notice that before?

717
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,050
因为我们喝醉了
Because we were drunk.

718
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,143
- 这是你的狗狗        - 不是 没养过
- Was it your dog?   - No. Never had one.

719
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:38,394
其他人都养的啊
But everyone else did.

720
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,184
我以为养狗就代表有个正常的家庭呢
And I thought having a dog
meant you had a normal family,

721
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:41,978
17岁的时候我真的很想养一条
which at 17 I desperately wanted.

722
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,980
叛逆的你却纹身了
So as a sign of rebellion you got a tattoo

723
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:45,652
纹了一个很常见的东西
of the most conventional thing
you could think of.

724
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,354
那时候真是酷毙了
It was super awesome back then.

725
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,654
- 看         - 恩
- Check it.  - Okay.

726
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,107
- 一道闪电           - 18岁的时候
- A lightning bolt?  - Eighteen.

727
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,407
- 想拥有超能力         - 恩
- Wanted superpowers.  - Yeah.

728
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:54,236
那时候我很迷哈利波特
I was a little into Harry Potter back then.

729
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:56,955
- 那时候你是个基吗
- 谁说喜欢哈利波特就代表是基啊!
- Were you also gay back then?
- Harry Potter doesn't make you gay!

730
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,828
- 好吧     - 你确定要这样?
- Okay.    - Are you sure about this?

731
00:35:58,907 --> 00:35:59,954
- 你呢        - 不
- Are you?    - No.

732
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:01,205
我也不确定
Me neither.

733
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,883
- 你今天过得怎样        - 还行
- How was your day?    - It was okay.

734
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,218
- 我中午吃了个火鸡三明治               - 味道如何
- I had a turkey sandwich for lunch.  - How was that?

735
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,053
很一般 你今天呢
It wasn't that good. How was your day?

736
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,548
还在研究地铁系统 比较难弄
Still trying to figure out that
subway system. It is tricky.

737
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:18,886

And it's out of here!

738
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:26,898
- 我的屁股   -什么?
- My butt.  - What?

739
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,565
- 噢 我的屁股疼   - 是嘛?
- Oh, my butt.    - Really?

740
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:31,823
我屁股快抽筋了 拿个枕头给我
No, I mean my butt, it's cramping.
Can you grab a pillow?

741
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,115
好 好
Okay, yeah, yeah.

742
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,240
- 不疼了吧        - 不了
- So, no butt?    - No.

743
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:42,208
- 真的? 这么快?      - 开玩笑
- Really? Already?   - Just kidding.

744
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,420
- 喜欢这个姿势吗             - 恩 还可以
- Do you like this position?  - Yeah, it's all right.

745
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,262
老实说 我有点萎了
I gotta be honest, I feel
a little emasculated.

746
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:59,138
女孩子脱光趴在你身上你却萎了?
A naked girl is lying on top of you
and you feel emasculated?

747
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,687
- 有点
- 你知道萎是什么意思 对吧
- Little bit.
- You do know what that word means, right?

748
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,810
我知道啊 我现在就这么觉得
Yes, I know what it means, and I feel it.

749
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,104
好吧 好吧
Okay, all right, you big baby.

750
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,394
- 换个位置             - 好的!
- Chinese fire drill.  - Okay. Go!

751
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:12,776
Okay.

752
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,076
- 雄起了吗?                - 是的
- Do you feel manly now?   - I do.

753
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:18,494
好的 放进来
Okay. Put it in.

754
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:20,947
这一点都不好笑
That's not funny.

755
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:22,783
- 有点意思             - 有点意思
- It's kind of funny.  - It's kind of funny.

756
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:28,459
- 等等        - 怎么了
- Hold on.    - What's wrong?

757
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,581
我得上一下厕所
I have to go to the bathroom.

758
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,008
- 啥 现在?    - 是啊 今天吃太多西瓜了
- What? Now? - Yes, now. I had a lot of watermelon.

759
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:44,350
你搞啥飞机呀
What's going on in there?

760
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:46,098
你知道小弟弟硬起来的时候要撒尿有多痛苦吗?
Do you know how hard it is
to pee with a hard-on?

761
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:47,228
不 不知道
No, actually.

762
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:49,605
就像被挤压的感觉 要很久的
It's like two lanes of traffic
merging into one. It takes time.

763
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,776
- 你在拉屎?          - 没啊
- Are you pooping?   - No.

764
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:59,987
- 那你为什么坐着               - 这样容易控制一些啊
- Why are you sitting down?   - It's easier to control.

765
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,994
- 难道你想我撒得到处都是吗    - 不 不 不 不好意思
- You want a mess in here?   - No. No, no. Sorry.

766
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,175
耶
Yeah.

768
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,226
咋了 我有洒出来吗
What? Did I leak?

769
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:25,345
洗手了没
Did you wash your hands?

770
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:26,892
噢 老兄!
Oh, come on, dude.

771
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,640
我知道我们是朋友 但我终归是个淑女啊
I know we're just friends,
but I'm still a lady.

772
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:32,360
给我把手洗了 然后再带着你的小屁屁来床上
Now get back in there, wash your hands
and then bring that fine ass back here.

773
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:35,026
你要是再这么说话 我就不来了
If you keep talking to me like that,
I'm not gonna come back.

774
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:43,572
- 疼死我了
- 吃个香蕉吧 在冰箱里
- My hammies are killing me.
- Have a banana, they're in the fridge.

775
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,074
你怎么把香蕉放冰箱里啊
Why would you keep bananas in the fridge?

776
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:47,538
- 会干掉的啊           - 不会的 香蕉有皮啊
- It dries them out.   - It doesn't. They have a peel.

777
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,161
又不是盔甲 空气还是会进去
It's not armor. Air still gets in.

778
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:50,496
你到底要不要吃香蕉
Do you want a banana or not?

779
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,080
如果是干的就算了 我又不是个动物
Not if they're dry. I'm not an animal.

780
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,879
至少我家还有吃的
At least I have food in the house.

781
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,840
你家就只有酸奶
All you have at home is drinkable yogurt.

782
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,171
我喜欢酸奶 不费时间
I like to drink my yogurt.
It's a timesaver.

783
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:02,724
那你觉得可以用省出的那点时间刮干净你的胡渣吗
Well, then you think you could use
that time to shave your stubble.

784
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,309
你的胡渣扎得好疼
Your whiskers are like knives.

785
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:08,059
看吧 如果你是我的女朋友 我肯定不能叫你闭嘴
Now, see, if you were my girlfriend,
I couldn't tell you to shut up right now.

786
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:10,565
正因为你只是我的炮友 我就可以告诉你
And because you're just my buddy,
I can tell you

787
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:15,404
如果你不刮胡子 我就不刮下面
that if you don't start shaving up here,
I'm gonna stop shaving down there.

788
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:21,492
嘿 嘿 嘿
Hey, hey. Hey...

789
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:23,115
- 妈妈   -" 妈妈"?
- Mom!   - "Mom"?

790
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:27,120
我的眼睛闭着的  我没看见你们在干什么
My eyes are covered.
I don't know what you're doing.

791
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,914
我没看见你正穿着黑色底裤呢
I can't see you putting on
your black underpants.

792
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,002
Jamie 宝贝 我真想你
Jamie, baby, I missed you.

793
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,421
噢 宝贝
On, baby.

794
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,924
-你的胸部变大了?              -妈妈 我在这
-Did your boobs get bigger?  -Mom, I'm over here.

795
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:39,051
嘿 宝贝 噢 噢 他们没变大
Hey, baby. Oh, no, they didn't.

796
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:42,973
- 你来这干嘛
- Victor是个蠢货
- What are you doing here?
- Victor turned out to be a total Lombard.

797
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:46,601
L-O-M-B-A-R-D 人傻钱多
L-O-M-B-A-R-D.
"Lots Of Money But A Real Dullard."

798
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:47,970
Victor是他的未婚夫
Victor, her fiancé.

799
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,471
前未婚夫
Ex-fiancé.

800
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:51,644
- 怎么了           - 没怎么 他就是爱胡扯
- What happened?   - Nothing. He was just blah.

801
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,607
对牛弹琴
I mean, nice, but it was
like talking to dirt.

802
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:56,444
某天我醒过来我对自己说"Lorna"  我是Lorna
I woke up one day and I said, "Lorna..."
I'm Lorna.

803
00:39:57,437 --> 00:40:00,281
- 我是Dylan  - 我说"Lorna, 这不是你的福气"
- Dylan.   - I said, "Lorna, this is not your bliss."

804
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,366    
- " 你已经39岁了"                - 48
- "Just because you're 39..."    - Forty-eight.

805
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:05,070
"但不代表你需要就此安定下来 他不是什么好的归宿"
"...It doesn't mean you have to settle.
He's not an insurance claim."

806
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,030
所以我撘第一班飞机离开那个岛了
So I caught the first plane off the island.

807
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,787
- 克里弗兰市不是岛            - 噢 宝贝 它是的
- Cleveland's not an island.  - Oh, baby, it is.

808
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,744
不管怎样 我来了 很高兴看到你
Anyway, here I am. It's so good to see you.

809
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:15,250
你没说起过你有个帅气男友啊
You never told me you had a hot boyfriend.

810
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:17,207
他不是我男友 老妈
He's not my boyfriend, Mom.

811
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,167
- 是啊 我们只是朋友                   - 我喜欢
- That's right, we're just friends.  - I love it.

812
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:21,670
充满70年代气息
It's like the '70s in here.

813
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:24,635
那是个更好的时代 只为了性
That was a better time. Just sex.

814
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:27,805
怀孕的时候
A little grass, a little glue...
Not during pregnancy.

815
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,599
当然最后的时候就不能做了
Well, not during the final trimester.

816
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:32,180
不用有什么顾虑 太棒了
But no complications. It's great!

817
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,854
好吧 我们就是这样的
Okay, well, that's technically, I guess,
what this is.

818
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:37,314
就是这样
That's exactly what this is.

819
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,278
那我女儿就是你的泄欲工具了?
So my daughter is just your slampiece?

820
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,322
不 不 "泄欲工具"?
No, no. "Slampiece"?

821
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,658
开玩笑! 继续吧
I'm just kidding. Slam away.

822
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,113
玩得开心 我觉得这很棒
Have fun. I think this is great.

823
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:46,820
有一点就是 你不用再去商场购物了
The only thing is, it
takes you off the market.

824
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,954
去他喵的商场 既然你想要的都有了 
But what the hell.
The whole reason you go to the market

825
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,783
为什么还要去买呢
is to buy the produce,
which you already got.

826
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:56,997
见到你真是太好了 宝贝 我只待几个星期就走
It's so good to see you, baby.
I'm only gonna be here a few weeks.

827
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,998
我快饿死了 有松子酒吗?
I'm starving. You got any gin?

828
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:00,959
在厨房里
It's in the kitchen.

829
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,507
你得走了
You gotta go.

830
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:06,306
- 她喷了香水吗                   - 我不知道 快走吧
- Is she wearing Axe body spray?  - I don't know. Come on.

831
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:08,679
香蕉放冰箱里? 你波多黎各人吗?
Bananas in the refrigerator?
What are you, Puerto Rican?

832
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:12,558
- 这么说不太好吧 老妈
- 开玩笑呢 你老爹就是波多黎各人
- That is terrible, Mother.
- Just joking. Your dad was Puerto Rican.

833
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,181
什么? 你说他是希腊人
What? You said that he was Greek.

834
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:15,815
- 土豆 土豆...          - 穿鞋
- Potato, potato...    - Get your shoes.

835
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,439
- 好 好               - 快走 快走
- Okay. All right.    - Well, not... Just go, just go.

836
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:20,065
我把他们放自行车上?
I'll just put these on on the bike?

837
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,233
- 是的      - 好吧
- Yeah     - Okay.

838
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:22,901
很高兴见到你
It was nice to have met you...

839
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,615
- 嘿       - 你脱裤子呢
- Hey.    - And your pants are coming off.

840
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:26,739
天哪  妈 ! 拜托
Oh, my... Mom! Mom, please!

841
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,029

Back, back!

842
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,919
That's what I'm talking about!

843
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:39,206
我们要打败所有的基佬
We're kicking every gay ass out here!

844
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:41,758
没有轻蔑的意思 有搞基的吗?
I don't say that pejoratively,
I say it hopefully.

845
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:43,376
等等 你是基吗
Hold it. Any of you gay?

846
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:45,045
- 你也不是?       - 得了吧 老兄
- Not even you?   - Come on, man.

847
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,263
等会我们谈谈 只谈5分钟就好
Come talk to me after.
Give me five minutes of your time.

848
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,098
你也许有理由让你相信
I might be able to let you see some reason.

849
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:57,015
真牛
Look at you in the house!

850
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:58,224
来吧 宝贝
Come on, baby!

851
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:00,852
我该去见Jamie了
I'm supposed to meet up with Jamie.

852
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,609
谁? 那个猎头?
Who's that, that headhunter?

853
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,198
咋 你们现在约会呢
What, you guys going out now?

854
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:07,901
不 不 我们只是普通朋友 关系有点乱
No, no, no, we're just friends.
We're messing around a little bit.

855
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:09,994
- 什么意思            - 睡在一起
- What do you mean?   - Sleeping together.

856
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,366
只是为了上床
But it's just sex.

857
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:13,073
行不通的 老兄
That never works, bro.

858
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:16,918
她是个女孩 性对她们来说重要得多 不管承认与否
She's a girl. Sex always means more
to them even if they don't admit it.

859
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:18,168
Jamie不同
Jamie's different.

860
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,838
难道她有小JJ?
Does she have a penis
where most girls have a vagina?

861
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,586
- 没有       - 那她就没有不同
- No penis.  - Then she's no different.

862
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,292
你又对女人了解多少啊
What do you know about women, anyway?

863
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:27,091
老弟 我吃过的盐比你吃的饭还要多好吗
Dude, I've turned down more tail
than you'll ever have.

864
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,303
是啊 老兄 但你是个基..
Yeah, bro. You're gay.

865
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:32,259
但是还是有很多人投怀送抱啊 看看我
But the offers still keep rolling
in, naturally. Look at me.

866
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:38,640
嘿 我喜欢女人 她们既庄严又神秘 既美丽又迷人
And, hey, I love women. They're beautiful,
majestic, mysterious, mesmerizing creatures.

867
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:42,736
既聪明睿智又善解人意 各方面比男人更胜一筹
Smart, empathetic.
Far superior to men in every way.

868
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:46,572
如果我有选择 我肯定会选和一个女人在一起直到死去
And if I had a choice,
I would be with women to my dying day.

869
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:49,821
但我是个基...
But me likes cock so I'm
strict-aly dick-aly.

870
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:53,246
所以说 一切不就只是为了性嘛?
So it's always just about sex, then?

871
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:56,666
不是 我也曾深爱过 
No. I've been in love.
I went down that rabbit hole.

872
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,288
直到我发现了什么吗
You know what I discovered?

873
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:01,045
当你爱一个人 你会想着怎么跟她一起度过整个周末
It's not who you want to spend
Friday night with,

874
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,589
而不仅仅是星期五晚上
it's who you want to spend
all day Saturday with.

875
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:04,756
懂了吧 
Feel me, Felix?

876
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:08,177
是啊 然后把生命中每一天都当成是周末
Yeah, but then it's every Saturday
for the rest of your life.

877
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:10,096
你现在不懂也没关系
It's okay, you don't get it.

878
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:12,511
没啥大不了的 你终究会明白的
It's no big deal. But you will.

879
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:17,099
终有一天 你将会遇到一个你深爱的人
One day, you'll meet someone
and it'll literally take your breath away.

880
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:21,357
爱到无法呼吸 
Like you can't breathe.
Like no oxygen to the lungs.

881
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:23,860

882
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:25,444
不 你才不懂
Yeah, you don't.

883
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:28,356
早上的新网站做得很不错 顺便说下
Nice work on that new online site,
by the way.

884
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:30,317
页面头条的字体是什么?
What was the font on that headline?

885
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,700
是Times Roman字体
It was Times Roman.

886
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:34,116
Times Roman  不错 我走了
Times Roman. Inspired. I'm out.

887
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,707
你有船?
You have a boat?

888
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:45,169
我住在泽西城 我不搭轮渡
I live in Jersey.
And I ain't taking no ferry.

889
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:47,709
除非是去吃晚饭或者看表演
Unless it's out to dinner and a show.

890
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,017
- 嘿    - 啥
- Hey.  - Yeah.

891
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:10,445
你和那个Dylan 有性无爱的朋友关系 真不错 
You and that Dylan? Way to go.
I mean the whole friendship-sex thing.

892
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:12,196
干得漂亮
Kudos, baby, kudos.

893
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:15,036
没什么大不了的
It's not that big of a deal.

894
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:19,161
我只是有点惊讶 我一直以为你是相信真爱的女孩
It's just surprising. I always thought
you were a true-love kind of girl.

895
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,539
不管怎么样 妈 这又不会影响我做其他事情
Whatever, Mom. It's not like
it's stopping me from anything.

896
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:24,545
78年的时候我也这么想的
That's what I thought back in '78.

897
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,672
之后也是
And every year since.

898
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,258
事实上我还是很高兴的
I'm just... I'm flattered, actually.

899
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,343
有其母必有其女嘛
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

900
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,009
只是有点点意外而已
It's just surprising.

901
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:38,225
- 好了 搞定                           - 恩
- There, done. It's... There we go.   - Okay.

902
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:42,848
看起来真漂亮 像个公主
You look great! You look great.
You look like a princess.

903
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:44,728
- 是      - 是吗
- Yeah!   - Really?

904
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:46,234
- 是啊    - 恩
- Yeah.   - Okay.

905
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:50,196
7月4号那天 我朋友把他在蒙淘克的房子借给我
Hey, my friend gave me his house
in Montauk for July 4th.

906
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:53,195
我们一起去那 远离尘嚣 远离男人
Let's you and me go away together.
No men, no bullshit.

907
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:56,073
就我们母女俩 跟<<Nora Ephron>>电影里的那样
Just mother-daughter.
Like a Nora Ephron movie.

908
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:59,410
上次我们母女共度周末是什么时候
When was the last time
we spent a full weekend together?

909
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:02,576
我8岁的时候 在佛蒙特 跟着一个滑雪教练
When I was eight, that time in Vermont.
We got snowed in with the ski instructor.

910
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,792
- Demitri    - 是Bill
- Demitri.   - Bill.

911
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,253
他让我想起了你父亲
He reminded me a lot of your father.

912
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:08,923
深色卷发 橄榄色的皮肤 冷战般的口音
Dark curls, olive skin, Cold War accent.

913
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,883
- 我父亲是俄罗斯人?        - 不记得了
- My father was Russian?  - I don't remember.

914
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:14,091
我只记得我们喝了很多伏特加 然后打了很多炮
But what I do remember is we drank
a lot of vodka and shot a lot of guns.

915
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:17,757
老妈 这个"谁是你父亲"的游戏越来越没意思了
Mom, this "who's your daddy" game
is getting really old.

916
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:20,601
我知道我不是世界上最好的母亲
I know I haven't been
the best mother in the world...

917
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:25,064
对不起 你在设套让我往里跳吗
I'm sorry,
were you waiting for me to jump in?

918
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:28,393
来啊 一起去吧
Come on! Go away with me. Come on!

919
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:31,070
去吧 去吧
Come on. Come on.

920
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:34,323
好 我去 会很有趣 是吧?
Okay, we'll do it. It'll be fun, yeah?

921
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:42,949
- 妈..     - 母女连心
- Mom...   - I was trying to bond!

922
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:45,452
都很好看的嘛
It was either this or sniff glue.

923
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,251
- 关于我妈的事 不好意思了 - 我觉得她很有趣呢
- Sorry about my mom.    - I thought she was funny.

924
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:56,133
是啊 她要钱的时候 特别有趣
Yeah, she's really funny
when she's asking for money,

925
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:58,803
她要来过来住的时候 更加有趣
and she's hilarious
when she needs a place to stay.

926
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:07,265
Dylan 我觉得我想重新开始约会了
Dylan, I think I wanna start dating again.

927
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,144
听着 我觉得我们不能再这样了
Listen, I think we should stop this.

928
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:15,448
是吗
Yeah?

929
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,195
我觉得你是对的
I kind of think you're right.

930
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,317
是吗
Right?

931
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:24,033
一扇门关闭 另一扇门又会打开
Every new beginning
comes from some other beginning's end.

932
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:25,916
这话确实有道理
That actually makes sense right here.

933
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:27,960
谁有能想到<<Third Eye Blind>>这首歌如此有预见性呢
Who would've thought Third Eye Blind
could be so prophetic?

934
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,161
不是<<Third Eye Blind>>
Not Third Eye Blind.

935
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:31,005
我很肯定是的
I'm pretty sure that's Third Eye Blind.

936
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,289
想去吃点午餐吗
Do you wanna go grab some lunch?

937
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:33,499
- 恩     - 好的
- Yes.   - Okay.

938
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:35,301
- 你买单           - 啥?
- You're buying.   - What?

939
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:38,637
好吧
Okay.

940
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:42,008
- 裤子     - T恤
- Pants.   - Shirt.

941
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,847
就这么结束了?
So this is the end of this?

942
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,887
- 我想是的 但这是好事            - 是啊
- I guess so. But it's good.     - Yeah.

943
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:47,389
- 目的达到了          -单纯上床 没有其他
- And we did it.     - With no bullshit.

944
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:48,560
- T恤        - 汗衫
- Shirt.     - Sweater.

945
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,316
我们还是朋友
We managed to actually stay friends.

946
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:52,810
- 是的    - 是啊
- Yup.   - Yeah.  

947
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,029
那到底喜欢什么类型的女孩
Okay. So, what is your type, anyway?

948
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:01,193
没有固定的类型
No, I don't have a type.

949
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,579
- 我更注重内涵                    -噢 得了吧
- It's more about what's inside.  - Oh, please!

950
00:47:03,696 --> 00:47:05,414
好吧 她怎么样
Okay, what about her?

951
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,038
恩 我可以去探究一下她的内心世界
Yeah. I could get to know her inside.

952
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:09,206
她正在阅读呢
And she's reading a book.

953
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:11,333
Nicholas Sparks的小说
It's probably Nicholas Sparks.

954
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,669
- 我去跟她搭讪               - 什么?
- I'm gonna go talk to her.  - What?

955
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,917
这么惊讶干嘛 不是说了我们可以再开始约会吗
What do you mean, "What?"
We said we wanted to date again.

956
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:17,715
- 我去了                       - 现在?
- I'm gonna go talk to her.   - Now?

957
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,337
当着这么多人的面?
Here, in front of all of these people?

958
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,723
我又不是要去强奸她 只是搭讪而已
I didn't say I was gonna rape her.
I said I was gonna go talk to her.

959
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:29,393

965
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:50,163
我告诉她露台在哪
I showed her where the balcony was,

966
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,916
她要在那和她丈夫碰头
because that's where

00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:52,581
何时再能见到你啊
When can I see you again?

1009
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:57,703
现在啊
Right now.

1010
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:00,582
- 开玩笑             - 好吧
- I'm just kidding.  - Okay.

1011
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,379
你能想象谁会这样说话呢
Can you imagine
someone who would actually say that?

1012
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:04,711
高中我吹过大号
I played the tuba in high school.

1013
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:07,047
世界上最醇的乐器了
World's stupidest instrument.

1014
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,097
特别是当你搬了8次家
Especially when you move eight times.

1015
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:12,886
- 为什么搬家
- 我老妈经常跟男人分分合合
- Why'd you move? 
- My mom really likes to break up with guys,

1016
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:14,429
她很擅长这个
and she was really good at it.

1017
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:16,848
- 你父亲也是其中之一吗 
- 不 不 他是很早以前的事了
- Was your dad one of them? 
- No, no, he was long before that.

1018
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:18,561
事实上我从来没机会认识我爸爸
I actually never knew my dad.

1019
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:20,268
我很遗憾 那太糟糕了
I'm sorry. That sucks.

1020
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,573
好吧 我觉得我应该告诉你一些事情了
All right, look, I think I should
probably tell you something.

1021
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,199
别说你有小JJ啊
Please don't tell me you're a dude.

1022
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:29,527
不然自从我来这之后 这是第三次了 
Because that'll be like the third time
since I moved here,

1023
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,237
我可再也承受不了了
and I don't think I can handle that.

1024
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:32,576
我有个5次约会原则
I have a five-date rule.

1025
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:36,079 
- 你知道的 要约会5次我们才能...            - 恩
- You know, like, five dates before we...  - Yeah.

1026
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,957
我在电影里见过 我想试试看
I saw it in a movie.
I thought I'd give it a try.

1027
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:41,293
你值得我等待
You're worth waiting for.

1028
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:44,257
我很肯定这也是那部电影里的台词
I'm sure that was the line
in the movie you saw.

1029
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,086
真不错
That's awesome.

1030
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:50,052
我给一个4岁的小孩做了几个月的治疗
This four-year-old that I've been
working on for the last couple months,

1031
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:51,303
他马上就要康复了
he's gonna be fine.

1032
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:52,762
- 那太棒了       - 是啊
- That's great.  - Yeah.

1033
00:50:53,591 --> 00:50:55,219
怎么你这样男人还是单身啊
How is a guy like you single?

1034
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:58,306
我只是在公园里等待一个女孩的出现
I've just been waiting for someone
to come up to me in the park

1035
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:00,941
然后夸我在看树而不是看美女
and compliment me for looking at the trees
and not the sunbathers.

1036
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,435
我是认真的 给了我不错的印象
I meant it. It was impressive.

1037
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,562
事实上 坦白的说
Actually, if I'm gonna be
completely honest with you,

1038
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:06,363
我只是在站着打瞌睡
I was sleeping standing up.

1039
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:09,567
我连续工作了36个小时 我都不知道我怎么就到公园里了
I worked 36 hours straight.
I don't even know how I got to the park.

1040
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:11,827
你这样的女孩怎么也单身
How is a girl like you single?

1041
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:14,905
各种各样的问题
I have issues.

1042
00:51:15,114 --> 00:51:16,661
貌似有人说我有情感病
One might even call me damaged.

1043
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:18,493
事实上 确实有个人这么说我的
Actually, one did call me damaged.

1044
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:19,743
别扯了 怎么个病法
Get out of here. Damaged how?

1045
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:21,669
我比较相信真爱
I kind of believe in true love.

1046
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,923
有个白马王子会来接我
That there might be
a Prince Charming out there for me.

00:51:28,889 --> 00:51:30,001
盯着树看的那家伙怎么样?


1047
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:35,226
听着 我知道你也许会说不 因为你跟木偶一样除了工作就是工作
Listen, I know this is probably a no
because all you do is work like a dull boy,

1048
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:37,645
但是一起去喝一杯怎么样
but would you like to come get a beer?

1049
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:38,762
不用了
I'm good.

1050
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:40,598
又不是基佬酒吧
No, it's not a gay bar.

1051
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:44,652
而且那还有很多帅哥靓妹哦
And there'll be just as many hot girls
as hot guys.

1052
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:49,031
好吧 我去
You know what? I will come out.

1053
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:51,942
好呀 去找个好女孩
All right. Let's find you a lady.

1054
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:54,111
你还是不肯搞基 是吧?
You're still not gay, right?

1055
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,491
- 不    - 好吧
- Nope. - Okay.

1056
00:52:01,327 --> 00:52:03,000
- 什么?   - 你知道今天什么日子吗
- What?   - Do you know what today is?

1057
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:06,336
- 第五次约会          - 我都没在算
- Date number five.  - I wasn't even counting.

1058
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:14,640
- 想去床上吗?                - 不 就这很好
- Wanna go in the bedroom?  - No. Here's fine.

1059
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:23,190
很高兴今天遇到你
I am so glad I met you tonight.

1060
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:25,229
我也是
Me, too.

1061
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:31,031
你在想什么
What are you thinking?

1062
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:34,155
在想你是多么棒
Just how great you are.

1063
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:47,168
Annie 嘿
Annie, hey.

1064
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,591
他喵的谁是Annie啊
Who the fuck is Annie?

1065
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:50,925
我姐姐
My sister.

1066
00:52:51,043 --> 00:52:53,045
最好是 不然我切了她
Better be. I'll cut her.

1067
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:56,719
当然 我马上就来
Of course I'm coming.

1068
00:52:57,049 --> 00:53:01,225
是啊 我4号请假 我会待3天
Yeah, I'm taking the 4th off,
so I'll be there for three days.

1069
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,524
恩 爸爸怎么样了
Yeah. How's Dad?

1070
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,401
恶化了吗?
Any worse?

1071
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:17,866
恩恩 替我向他问好
All right, tell him I said hi.

1072
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:20,239
拜 Banannie
Bye, Banannie.

1073
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:26,253
我想跟你父母见面
I want you to meet my parents.

1074
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,793
不.. 你? 确定?
No, you... Really?

1075
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:37,593
天哪
God!

1076
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,993
嘿 等下
Hey. Hold on, hold on.

1077
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:01,238
别 等我一下下
No, just hold on. Just give me a second.

1078
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:04,120
我找个地方说话
I gotta go find a place to talk. Okay.

1079
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,458
靠 别挂
Shit. Shit. Just hold Oh.

1080
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:09,751
- 噢 不好意思  - 别挂
- Oh, sorry.   - Hold on.

1081
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:11,423
昨晚我很晚出去了
I was out pretty late last night.

1082
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:14,673
回来的时候 看见你和你的女朋友在沙发上
When I got in, you and your girlfriend
were on the couch

1083
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,340
所以我就倒在你床上了
so I just crashed in your bed.

1084
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:18,135
- 他不是个女的        - 闻起来像
- He's not a girl.   - He smells like a girl.

1085
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:20,516
- 你闻了他?          - 我想买棉花糖
- You smelled him?  - I wanna buy marshmallows.

1086
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:23,226
- 你说什么?           - 周末去蒙淘克
- What did you say?  - For Montauk this weekend.

1087
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:26,101
我想去露营 就像你小时候那样
I wanna do a campfire,
like when you were little.

1088
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,272
好吧
Okay.

1089
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:30,317
- 然后我们去找棒棒糖
- 好吧 棒棒糖
- And then we're gonna look for sticks.
- I hear you. Sticks.

1090
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:33,313
然后我们再唱歌 我们再...
And then we're gonna sing. We're gonna...

1091
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:35,447
等一下
Just hold on a second.

1092
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,612
恩
Okay.

1093
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:40,865
恩
Okay.

1094
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:47,083
怎么了
What's up?

1095
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:49,127
你觉得男人是关心全球变暖多点
Do you think guys care more
about global warming

1096
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:51,626
还是会关心怎么穿着白色裤子去烧烤多点
or how to wear white pants to a cookout?

1097
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:52,831
好吧 那要看情况
Well, that depends.

1098
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,630
你有穿着比基尼的性感模特站在雪顶上的吗
Do you have a hot model in a bikini
standing on an icecap?

1099
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,427
没 在滑道上
No. Ski slope.

1100
00:54:57,503 --> 00:54:59,471
我还是选穿白色裤子去烧烤的吧
I'd still go with pants to a cookout.

1101
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:01,177
恩 我也是
Yeah, me, too.

1102
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:04,514
你的Parker男孩怎么样了 还在盯着树看吗
How's your boy Parker?
Still staring at trees?

1103
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:06,888
来两杯咖啡  是啊 还在看大树呢
Two coffees.
Yeah, he's still looking up at trees,

1104
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:09,231
不过这次是在我家里看
but this time it's
actually in my apartment.

1105
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:11,726
- 这么快就第五次约会了?         - 可能吧   谢谢
- It's the fifth date already?  - Maybe. Thank you.

1106
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,569
那你们接下来做了?
Did you guys "fifth-date""?

1107
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:18,361
- 你怎么这样!  好女孩才不会说呢
- 我知道 所以我才问你啊
- How dare you! A lady never tells.
- I know. That's why I'm asking you.

1108
00:55:21,902 --> 00:55:24,746
嘿 我得挂了 祝你洛杉矶之行愉快 下飞机记得打电话给我
Hey. I gotta go. You have a great
trip in LA and call me when you land.

1109
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:26,198
好吧
Okay.

1110
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:27,745
Parker
Parker.

1111
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:29,705
嘿
Hey.

1112
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,838
我买了脱脂咖啡 加了一份白糖 一份Splenda( 一种甜蜜素)
I got us coffees.
Nonfat, one sugar, one Splenda.

1113
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:36,041
- 我得走了           - 什么?
- I gotta get going. - What?

1114
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,418
我以为你今天都不需要当班呢
I thought you weren't on call today.

1115
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:40,843
是不需要 但我有....有点事...
I'm not, but I got that thing...
I got stuff.

1116
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:42,548
医院刚打电话来
This... They just called me.

1117
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:46,518
- 真的吗?   - 是啊
- Really?   - Yeah.

1118
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:49,897
偷偷溜走 真是够俗套的
The sneak-out.
How incredibly cliché of you.

1119
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,390
我只是..
I just...

1120
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:54,268
我只是觉得我做不了你的白马王子
I don't think I can be
your Prince Charming.

1121
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:57,237
天哪 你根本没弄懂我的意思 
God, you totally didn't get
anything that I was saying, did you?

1122
00:55:57,354 --> 00:56:00,699
- 不 不 不 我觉得你很棒              - 是啊 你也是
- No, no, no. I think you're great.  - Yeah, you, too.

1123
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,697
嘿 那我们做朋友怎么样
Hey, you know what?
You and I should stay friends.

1124
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,778
- 真的吗?  - 假的! 去你大爷
- Really?  - No, go fuck yourself.

1125
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:17,090
谁能站着睡觉啊
Who sleeps standing up?

1126
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:18,755
你应该为我感到骄傲啊
You know, you'd be really proud of me.

1127
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:20,844
我骂他的时候我都没眨一下眼哦
I didn't even blink
when I told him to go fuck himself.

1128
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:24,594
- 你刚就眨了 
- 这不算 现在又不是当时
- You did just then, though.
- This does not count. I'm not in the moment.

1129
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,888
我不明白 或许我床上功夫太差
I don't know, maybe I suck in bed.

1130
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:28,310
相信我 你不差
Trust me, you don't suck in bed.

1131
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,937
- 谢谢        - 真是缺爱的孩子
- Thank you.  - So needy.

1132
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,681
嘿 也许那个人已经结婚了什么的呢
Hey, maybe the guy's married or something.

1133

01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:43,885
Dylan不怎么知道去适应老年痴呆的人
Dylan doesn't quite know
how to deal with the Alzheimer's.

1255
01:02:43,969 --> 01:02:45,186
很遗憾
I'm sorry.

1256
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:47,897
他可以跟原来一样 看起来一切都好
He'll be his regular old self
and everything seems fine,

1257
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:50,647
但是眨眼之间 也许就会离我们而去
and then just in a flash, he's gone.

1258
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:55,105
- 那是Dylan九岁的时候              - 那是鞭子吗
- That's Dylan when he was nine.  - Are those braids?

1259
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:57,983
他是Kris Kross的粉丝 记得他们吗?
He was going through a Kris Kross phase.
Remember them?

1260
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:06,199
- 那是你母亲吗?     - 不是 那是Dylan的语言治疗师
- Is that your mom? - No, that's Dylan's speech therapist.

1261
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:10,295
他有口吃 特别是他一紧张就越严重
He had a stutter.
It got real bad when he was nervous.

1262
01:03:10,537 --> 01:03:12,005
他的童年过得很艰难
He had a rough childhood.

1263
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:15,167
- 他的数学家教管这叫" 陶冶情操"
- 数学家教?
- His math tutor called it "character-building."
- Math tutor?

1264
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:19,138
我们讨论的是 8*6=1200
No, we're talking, like,
8 times 6 equals 1,200.

1265
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:21,306
感谢上帝他至少长的帅
But he's very visual, thank God.

1266
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:26,054
- 能说说这张相片吗
- 那是我的12岁惊喜生日派对
- Can you please explain to me this photo?
- That is my 12th-birthday surprise party.

1267
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:28,225
- 嘿       - 美妙的时刻
- Hey.    - Amazing moment.

1268
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:30,064
我很累 我去睡觉了
I'm exhausted. I'm gonna go to bed.

1269
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:33,230
- Jamie 房间觉得怎么样
- 很完美
- Jamie, you all good with your room? 
- Yeah. No, it's perfect.

1270
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,395
谢谢 谢谢
Thank you. Thank you for everything.

1271
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:43,411
Sam和我做了把女孩切成两半的魔术盒 所以你回房间的时候要小心
Sammy and I built a saw-a-girl-in-half box,
so just be careful on your way to bed.

1272
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:46,657
- 他不是真的用锯子吧?
- 当然是
- He's not using a real saw, is he?
- Of course he is. He's magnificent.

1273
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:50,536
我会确保他有刷牙 还有你 别相信她说的
I'll make sure he brushes his teeth,
and you, don't believe anything she says.

1274
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,162
她是个骗子
She's a liar.

1275
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:55,673
- 他很特别                    - 是啊 
- He's a pretty special guy.  - Yeah, I think so.

1276
01:03:58,418 --> 01:04:00,386
- Jamie           - 嘿
- Jamie. Hey.   - Hey.

1277
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:01,884
- 没睡吧?    - 是啊 
- You up?   - Yeah. Come in.

1278
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,639
- 我以为你去睡觉了呢                 - 是啊
- I thought you were going to bed.  - I was.

1279
01:04:06,718 --> 01:04:09,392
但是我意识到我们又都回到了单身 所以...
But then I realized
we were both single again, so...

1280
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:14,726
- 不了 老兄    - 为什么
- Dude, no.   - Why not?

1281
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,728
这次我用香皂洗过手了
I washed my hands. With soap this time.

1282
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,772
你认真的? 你怎么以为我有那个意思
Are you serious?
Why would you just assume?

1283
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:22,613
你在阳台上扭了扭脖子 这动作.. 就是信号 记得吗
You cracked your neck on the porch.
This thing. That's your tell, remember?

1284
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:26,076
我扭一扭脖子是因为我们坐了六个小时飞机
I cracked my neck
because we were on a flight for six hours,

1285
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:29,617
你一直在我耳边念叨飞机是怎么飞的
and you were yapping my ear off
about how planes all fly themselves,

1286
01:04:29,741 --> 01:04:31,243
我脖子都要抽筋了
and it actually kinked my neck a bit.

1287
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:34,087
- 所以 你不想喽?      - 不想 不想和你上床
- So, no?            -No. Not having sex with you.

1288
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:36,457
大姨妈来了?  他们做了个软件 等等
Is it your special time?
They have an app for that. No, wait.

1289
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:41,385
- 没来 你现在是安全期        - 我们谈过了
- Nope, you're good to go.  - We talked about this.

1290
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:44,135
- 再说 我刚被甩 所以                  - 好吧 对不起
- Plus, I just got dumped, so...     - Okay, I'm sorry.

1291
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:46,553
我以为这样能帮你忘掉他
I thought this would be a good way
to take your mind off him.

1292
01:04:46,633 --> 01:04:48,761
不 上床治不好我的情伤
No, I don't function that way.
Sex is not gonna help.

1293
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:51,347
你知道什么能治好我吗  情感
But you know what will? Emotional support.

1294
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:54,308
之前我们有性无爱 现在我们却有爱无性
Before we were sex without emotion,
and now we're emotion without sex.

1295
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:55,854
正是
Exactly.

1296
01:04:55,934 --> 01:04:57,777
我现在只想你做我的朋友
I just need you to be my friend right now.

1297
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,942
好吧 那我就听你说话 然后你一边帮我打飞机吧
Okay. So I'll listen to you
while you give me a hand job.

1298
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:02,574
- 不要        - 开玩笑  我知道了  晚安
- No.         - I'm kidding. I got it. Good night.

1299
01:05:02,816 --> 01:05:06,821
等等 朋友也可以待在一起 听听音乐什么的嘛
Wait, hold on! Friends can still hang out
and, I don't know, listen to music.

1300
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:08,117
听音乐?
Listen to music?

1301
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:11,282
我要杀了Annie
I'm gonna kill Annie.

1302
01:05:12,117 --> 01:05:15,121
- 真不敢相信你以前很喜欢他们
- 我不喜欢他们
- I can't believe you used to like them.
- I didn't like these guys.

1303
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:16,292
我甚至都不记得
I don't even remember...

1305
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:36,354
你开玩笑呢 这些家伙很带感的
Are you kidding me?
These dudes were da bomb.

1306
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:38,351
大家都反戴着Girbauds的帽子
Everybody had Girbauds,
we all wore them backwards.

1307
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:39,477
穿着棒球衫
The baseball jerseys.

1308
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:43,314
连续3年万圣节 我都打扮成Kris Kross
I went as Kris Kross
three years in a row for Halloween.

1309
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,613
- 噢 可怜的小孩       - 我可并不为此骄傲
- Oh, you poor kid.  - I'm not proud of it.

1310
01:05:45,859 --> 01:05:49,489
嘿 我借了你一本书 希望你不介意
Hey, I borrowed one of your books.
I hope that's okay.

1313
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:07,672
吓死你!
Surprise!

1314
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:14,684
你以前真的没有带女孩回家过吗
Have you really never brought
a girl home before?

1315
01:06:14,888 --> 01:06:16,686
我带你来了
I brought you here.

1316
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:19,980
我意思是女朋友 不是女性朋友
I mean like a real girl. Not a friend.

1317
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:22,854
- 女朋友?         - 是啊
- A real girl?   - Yeah.

1318
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:25,569
我想没有
I guess not.

1319
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:28,364
- 我分得很清楚                       - 啊 是啊
- Separation of church and state.   - Ah, yes.

1320
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:32,030
筑起一道又一道心墙 太有益健康了
Build up as many walls as possible.
That's really healthy.

1321
01:06:32,155 --> 01:06:34,249
- 什么 你要跟我谈这个?                      - 是啊
- What, are you talking to me about walls?  - Yeah.

1322
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:36,584
你和你母亲又怎么了
What about you and your mom?

1323
01:06:36,743 --> 01:06:39,713
你不能她一刚进门就把我赶出去啊
You couldn't get me out of there fast
enough when she walked in on us.

1324
01:06:39,871 --> 01:06:41,999
那是为了保护你 懂吗
That was for your own protection. Okay?

1325
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:45,927
她没给你留电话我已经很惊讶了
I'm just surprised she didn't try
to slip you her number or something.

1326
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:48,217
她留了 在我手机上
She did. She put it in my phone.

1327
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:50,432
- 还取名"御姐"    - 噢 天哪
- Under "MILF."   - Oh, my God.

1328
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:53,222
很好啊 我们就勾搭过一两次
It's cool, we only hooked up, like, twice.

1329
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:57,142
我脑子里已经快出现那个画面了
I'm starting to get a mental image.

1330
01:06:57,222 --> 01:06:58,474
我还有个视频
Well, I have a video image.

1331
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:01,730
别 住手
No. Just stop it. Just stop it.

1332
01:07:04,354 --> 01:07:06,402
这是错误的
Just wrong.

1333
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:10,906
什么?
What?

1334
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:14,743
没什么 很高兴遇到了你
Nothing. Just glad I met you.

1335
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:20,249
是啊 遇到你也不是太糟糕哈
Yeah, well, knowing you
doesn't suck either.

1336
01:07:38,096 --> 01:07:41,270
- 我以为你说....              - 我知道
- But I thought you said...  - I know what I said.

1337
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:19,538
天哪
God.

1338
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,603
Lasorda是个不错的投手 但更是个好经理人
Lasorda was a good pitcher,
but he was an even better manager.

1339
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:49,193
- 营救小组?
- 我没说他不是一名伟大的经理人
- Wrecking Crew?  
- I wasn't saying he's not a great manager.

1340
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:51,020
我只想说 他作为投手并为受到足够的赏识 
He's underappreciated as a pitcher,
that's all I'm saying.

1341
01:09:51,104 --> 01:09:52,447
我们懂
We get it. Guys.

1342
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:53,655
- 嗨    - 早上好

Well, in between the fires and the floods,
we get about 10 good days.

1345
01:10:01,239 --> 01:10:03,492
来 你俩坐一起
No, no. Here. You two sit together.

- Are you sure?    - Oh, yeah, no, no.

1347

- 我知道 我只是想看看船
- You don't have to do that, Dad.
- I know. I wanna look at the boat.

1348
01:10:07,829 --> 01:10:09,581
我喜欢那船
I love that boat.

Thank you.

1354
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:27,186
- 不错啊 伙计!        - 真厉害
- All right, man!    - Look at you!

1355
01:10:27,432 --> 01:10:30,561

Apologies.

- 你呢      - 很好
- You?      - Yeah.

1362
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:06,805
- 看到了吗 小Sam      - 是啊
- See them, Sammy?    - Yeah.

1363
01:11:08,639 --> 01:11:10,641
- 真酷 对吧             - 恩
- Pretty cool, huh?     - Yeah.

1364
01:11:11,559 --> 01:11:13,402
上帝啊 真棒
God, it's nice.

1365

1368
01:11:23,821 --> 01:11:26,495
嘿 别乱来 别在她身上施什么法术
Hey, easy, dude.
Don't you go casting a spell on her.

1369
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:30,499
我是魔术师 不是巫师 你这哈利波特基友
I'm a magician, not a wizard.
You and your gay Harry Potter.

1370
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:33,544
去了霍格沃茨学院改变了你的人生
You can't deny that going to Hogwarts
wouldn't be life-changing.

1371
01:11:34,665 --> 01:11:37,168
- 我想你        - 我也想你
- I miss you.   - I miss you, too, bud.

1372
01:11:38,169 --> 01:11:41,013
妈妈也想你 爷爷也是
Mom misses you. And so does Grandpa.

1373

Does he say anything?

1374
01:11:44,509 --> 01:11:47,353
没有 但他时常叫我Dylan
No. But sometimes he calls me Dylan.

1375
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:51,850
他说过他不想要那份工作的
He said that he didn't want the job.

1376
01:11:51,933 --> 01:11:54,686
他去纽约只是为了看看有些什么选择
That he was just coming to New York
to explore his options.

1377
01:11:54,936 --> 01:11:56,108
胡说八道
What a crock of gas.

1378
01:11:57,104 --> 01:11:59,198
西海岸飞到东海岸就是为了看看有什么选择?
You fly across the country
to explore your options?

1379
01:11:59,273 --> 01:12:00,695
拜托 我可不觉得是那样
Please. I don't think so.

1380
01:12:00,775 --> 01:12:04,405
就是 自从他下飞机 我就知道我已经抓牢他了
Exactly! Please, I knew I had him
the second he got off that plane.

1381
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:05,787
- 噢 是吗             - 是的
- Oh, did you, now?  - Yeah.

1382
01:12:05,863 --> 01:12:08,457
就是你光脚跳上行李传送带的那一刻?
Was that the same second you leapt
onto the baggage carousel barefoot

1383
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:09,876
跟<<威尔和格蕾丝>>里出现的那一幕一样?
and acted out a scene from Will and Grace?

1384
01:12:10,535 --> 01:12:12,412
- 她真那样?   - 噢 是啊 你真该看到的
- She did?   - Oh, yeah, you should have seen her.

1385
01:12:12,537 --> 01:12:13,880
"看着我 傻傻又可爱"
"Look at me, I'm goofy but cute."

1386
01:12:13,955 --> 01:12:15,502
你知道吗 那是我计划的一部分
You know what? It was all part of my plan.

1387
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:16,753
好计划
Quite a plan.

1388
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:18,342
猎头大学计划专业毕业的?
Did you major in Planning
at Headhunting College?

1389
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:20,761
- 真聪明
- 那不是真的大学 侄子
- So clever.
- It's not a real college, by the way, buddy.

1390
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:23,927
你们俩拌起嘴来就跟老夫老妻一样
You guys bicker like
you're an old married couple.

1391
01:12:24,215 --> 01:12:25,512
来 我的女士 选一张牌 
Here, pick a card, my lady.

1392
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:26,763
好的
Okay.

1393
01:12:26,884 --> 01:12:28,852
噢 别选那张 选上面这张
Oh, no, not that one. The one on top.

1394
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:31,101
- 这把戏不错哦        - 所以
- This is a good one. - So...

1395
01:12:31,222 --> 01:12:32,394
- 恩?     - 洗牌
- Yeah?   - Shuffle.

1396
01:12:32,557 --> 01:12:34,480
你给她定情礼物了吗?
Did you get her an engagement gift?

1397
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:37,486
我们没订婚 没在一起 只是朋友而已
We're not engaged, Dad. We're not together.
We're just friends.

1398
01:12:37,562 --> 01:12:41,738
好吧 你不想下定论 我理解 但至少送点珠宝吧
All right, you don't wanna label it.
I understand. But get her some jewelry.

1399
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:44,110
你妈妈就最爱珠宝了
The only thing your mom loves is jewelry.

1400
01:12:44,235 --> 01:12:47,739
不管她多么的不开心 我送她珠宝 她立马就高兴起来
I don't care how upset she is,
I get her jewelry, she lights right up.

1401
01:12:48,114 --> 01:12:49,286
她在哪?
Where is she, anyway?

1402
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:53,790
- 她没在这 爸爸
- 我知道 所以我才问你她在哪
- She's not here, Dad.
- I know, that's why I asked. Where is she?

1403
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:58,295
- 她不会来            - 为什么?
- She's not coming.    - Why not?

1404
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:01,586
她不再和你一起生活了 老爸 
She doesn't live with you any more, Pop.
You're not married.

1405
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:04,964
- 什么?    - 10年前她离开你了
- What?    - She left about 10 years ago.

1406
01:13:05,089 --> 01:13:06,181
我不明白
I don't understand.

1407
01:13:06,591 --> 01:13:08,468
你们离婚了 爸爸
She divorced you, Dad.

1408
01:13:11,596 --> 01:13:12,939
- 我得打电话给他         - 爸 你不能
- I have to call her.   - Dad, you can't.

1409
01:13:13,014 --> 01:13:14,436
别再指挥我该做什么
Stop telling me what to do.

1411
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:22,190
爷爷
Grandpa!

1413
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:25,193
- 没事吧 爸?        - 我没事
- You okay, Dad?   - I'm fine, I'm fine.

1414
01:13:25,276 --> 01:13:27,699
- 来 我扶你起来                - 不 不用你扶
- Here, let me help you up.   - No, don't. Don't!

1415
01:14:00,019 --> 01:14:01,487
我们到了
Here we are.

1416
01:14:02,563 --> 01:14:04,861
真美!
This is beautiful.

1417
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:07,735
恩 我以前常来这思考问题 我的天台
Yeah, this is where I used to
come to think. My rooftop.

1418
01:14:07,818 --> 01:14:09,320
你觉得那栅栏有多高?
Okay, how high do you think that fence is?

1419
01:14:09,487 --> 01:14:10,989
我6英尺高多一点
I'm a little over 6 foot.

1420
01:14:11,155 --> 01:14:14,409
栅栏看起来有3个我这么高 所以6乘以3
Looks like it's about three of me.
So six times three...

1421
01:14:15,493 --> 01:14:17,166
就是92英尺了
Ninety-two feet.

1422
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:21,041
- 92英尺! 真高呀 是吧                         - 是啊
- Ninety-two feet. That's really tall, right?  - Yeah.

1423
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:25,503
他们不想让人上来这 所以才修了栅栏
But they don't want you to get up there,
so I guess that makes sense.

1424
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:29,341
- 等等 6乘以3....            - 噢 上帝 可怜的孩子
- Wait. Six times three...  - Oh, God, you poor kid.

1425
01:14:30,216 --> 01:14:32,059
- 怎么了?      - 走吧
- What's up?   - Come on.

1426
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:34,057
什么? 你要去哪啊?
What? What? Where are you going?

1427
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:37,398
Jamie 别  等等  这事很严重的
Jamie, no, no, no, no, no, wait.
They take this shit seriously, okay?

1428
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:38,516
看这些监控摄像头
Look at all the cameras.

1429
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:41,978
这是除了山达基教中心外 这座城市的唯一地标了
This is the only landmark this city has
other than the Scientology Center.

1430
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:45,156
如果这些摄像头跟山达基教中心联接起来
And if any of these cameras are hooked up
to the actual Scientology Center,

1431
01:14:45,231 --> 01:14:47,108
我很抱歉 这个笑话不妥
that was an inappropriate joke
and I apologize.

1432
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:49,785
科幻小说万岁!
I believe in the freedom
of science fiction.

1433
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:52,951
胆小鬼 ..不好意思
Pussy! Oh, sorry.

1434
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:54,077
胆小鬼
Pussy!

1435
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:55,540
走吧!
Come on!

1436
01:15:01,872 --> 01:15:04,671
- 你真的从没来过这上面                    -没
- You really never been up here before    - No.

1437
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:07,219
我也从没吸过毒
I've also never transferred
heroin in my rectum,

1438
01:15:07,294 --> 01:15:09,092
因为那是犯法的
'cause it's against the law.

1439
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:13,222
你知道吗 有时候回答问题一个词就够
You know, sometimes a simple
yes or no answer is adequate.

1440
01:15:13,384 --> 01:15:15,057
嘿 为什么你从不跟我谈起你母亲
Hey, why didn't you tell me about your mom?

1441
01:15:15,553 --> 01:15:17,555
她不值得我谈
She's not worth talking about.

1442
01:15:18,222 --> 01:15:19,223
这样说不太好吧
That's rough.

1443
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:20,934
抛弃家庭难道就好
So is leaving your husband and kids.

1444
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:24,107
你也没跟我谈起过你父亲
Yeah, you never told me about him either.

1445
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:26,151
知道吗 还有很多事你没告诉过我
You know, there's a lot of stuff
you didn't tell me.

1446
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:27,819
我不想你可怜我
I don't want your pity.

1447
01:15:29,316 --> 01:15:33,071
我就是受不了人们同情的眼神
I can handle anything except
that look in people's eyes.

1448
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:38,413
- 就那样      - 谁在意啊
- That one.  - Who cares what anybody thinks?

1449
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:42,296
他是我认识的最聪明的人 我只听取他的建议
He's the smartest man I've ever known.
He's the only person I'd ever go to for advice.

1450
01:15:42,413 --> 01:15:43,665
他是我父亲
He's my dad.

1451
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:45,211
Dylan 他还是他
Dylan, he's still the same man.

1452
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:46,634
当我看到人们看着他的那种眼神
When I see the way people
look at him now...

1453
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:49,925
别人的眼光不重要啊
It doesn't matter how people look at him.

1454
01:15:50,004 --> 01:15:51,256
只有你的眼神才是最重要的
All that matters is how you look at him.

1455
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:54,182
是啊 但人们都看着他没穿裤子到处晃悠
Yeah, but he's walking around
without his pants. Everyone's staring.

1456
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:55,893
- 那又怎样?       - 很尴尬
- So what?        - It's embarrassing.

1457
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:57,641
他需要知道什么都没改变
He needs to know that nothing has changed.

1458
01:15:57,762 --> 01:15:59,639
对你来说 他还是那个他
That he's still that same man to you.

1459
01:15:59,764 --> 01:16:01,766
我们能换个话题吗
Can we stop talking about this?

1460
01:16:03,309 --> 01:16:06,563
好吧 真聪明 别谈什么感受了
Yeah, that's really smart.
Let's just not talk about our feelings.

1461
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:07,771
我尽量不去
I'm trying not to.

1462
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:12,869
行了 有什么不对劲吗? 你最近有点奇怪
Come on. Is something going on here?
You've been acting really weird.

1463
01:16:13,194 --> 01:16:14,946
- 没啊            - 你有
- No, I haven't.  - Yeah, you have.

1464
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:16,826
是不是关于那天晚上发生的事?
Is this about what
happened the other night?

1465
01:16:16,947 --> 01:16:19,041
什么事? 上床? 那不代表什么 你知道的
What, sex? That doesn't mean anything.
You know that.

1466
01:16:22,286 --> 01:16:23,333
是啊
Right.

1467
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:25,627
- 我也没有变得古怪                   - 好吧
- And I haven't been acting weird.   - Okay.

1468
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:29,669
- 噢 上帝啊    - 噢 靠
- Oh, my God! - Oh, shit!

1469
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:31,758
- 跟你说了!      - 好吧 对不起!
- I told you!   - Well, I'm sorry!

1470
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:32,884
我擦!
Fuck!

1471
01:16:32,963 --> 01:16:36,058
这是洛杉矶警察局,你涉嫌非法侵入 从标牌上下来
This is the LAPD. You are trespassing.
Get down from the sign.

1472
01:16:36,133 --> 01:16:37,305
我们得跳下去
We gotta jump.

1473
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:41,643
- Dylan 跳啊!    - 我动不了了
- Dylan, jump!   - I'm frozen.

1474
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:42,814
快下来啊
Come on, get down!

1475
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:44,016
最后警告一次
Sin this is your last warning.

1476
01:16:44,141 --> 01:16:46,314
- 用楼梯啊            - 我有恐高症
- Use the ladder!     - I have a fear of heights!

1477
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:51,316
我也怕直升机! 
And also helicopters!
They don't make sense to me!

1478
01:16:51,398 --> 01:16:53,742
你说你有恐高症是什么意思?
What do you mean
you have a fear of heights?

1479
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:55,615
那你为什么还要上来
Why would you come up here?

1480
01:16:55,694 --> 01:16:58,243
你骂我胆小鬼
You called me a pussy!

1481
01:17:00,241 --> 01:17:02,915
今天下午 在南部发生了一件奇闻趣事
A bizarre situation
this afternoon in the Southland.

1482
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:06,543
洛杉矶警察局从城市的唯一地标:好莱坞山顶字牌上
The LAPD rescued a local man from the Hollywood sign

1483
01:17:06,997 --> 01:17:08,715
解救了一位当地民众
the city's only real landmark.

1484
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:11,006
他们居然把你包在毯子里
They actually wrapped
you in a foil blanket!

1485
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:12,757
你之前是去跑马拉松了吗?
Did you run a marathon before this?

1486
01:17:12,837 --> 01:17:14,384
- 好了 给我          - 不
- Okay. Give me...  - No!

1487
01:17:14,505 --> 01:17:16,758
- 不 我想录下来 我得录下来
- 住手 够了!
- No, no. I wanna save it. I gotta save it.
- No. That's enough!

1488
01:17:16,841 --> 01:17:19,094
- 给我遥控器! 闭嘴 - 我要一遍又一遍的看
- Give me the remote! Shut up!
- No, I wanna watch it over and over.

1489
01:17:19,176 --> 01:17:20,769
大毛毯
Foil wrapper...

1490
01:17:20,845 --> 01:17:22,062
好了 好了 好了
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1491
01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:24,765
会上Youtube的
It's okay, it'll be up on YouTube.

1492
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:29,779
嘿 我带Sam去特区的时候 你能帮我照看下老爸吧? 
Hey, you're still good to take Dad that week I
have to go to DC for Sam's class trip, right?

1493
01:17:29,854 --> 01:17:33,028
- 恩 他在纽约跟我待一起                        - 恩 那好
- Yeah, he's gonna stay with me in New York.  - Oh, good.

1494
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:36,118
那 我们时候能再见到Jamie?
So, when are we gonna see Jamie again?

1495
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:37,661
我不知道
I don't know.

1496
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:40,114
怎么了  跟她吵架了?
What's your problem?
Did you have a fight with your girlfriend?

1497
01:17:40,197 --> 01:17:42,245
她不是我女朋友 你就怎么不相信呢
She's not my girlfriend.
Why don't you believe me?

1498
01:17:42,366 --> 01:17:44,710
你要是诚实点 我就信了
I would believe you if
you didn't lie to me.

1499
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:46,833
那天晚上我看见你从她房间蹑手蹑脚的溜出来
I saw you creeping out of her room
the other night.

1500
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:48,960
就像刚做完爱从床上下来 懂我意思吧
Like you had just had sex,
if you know what I mean.

1501
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:50,958
我懂你刚说的
Yes, I know what you
mean, you just said it.

1502
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:53,260
你怎么知道我跟她做...
And how do you know
what I look like after I have...

1503
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:56,597
我才不和你谈这个呢 又不是我们谈恋爱
I'm not talking to you about this, okay?
We're not together.

1504
01:17:57,047 --> 01:17:59,266
- Dylan     - 够了! 我不想谈这个了
- Dylan.    - Enough! I'm not talking about it.

1505
01:17:59,466 --> 01:18:00,718
Dylan
Dylan.

1506
01:18:02,553 --> 01:18:03,975
忘记拿锯子了 马上回来
Forgot my saw. I'll be right back.

1507
01:18:06,557 --> 01:18:09,106
我等你 别担心我
I'll wait here. Don't worry about me.

1508
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:12,400
普通朋友也上床?  你以为是大学里啊?
Friends who have sex?
What are you, in college?

1509
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:14,447
- 不重要了 结束了                - 为什么?
- It doesn't matter, it's over.   - Why?

1510
01:18:14,565 --> 01:18:16,238
因为我们不是真心实意喜欢对方的
Because we don't like each other like that.

1511
01:18:16,317 --> 01:18:19,287
好吧 我们坐下来谈谈
Okay, you know what?
Can we just talk about this? Sit down.

1512
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:20,992
你还在寻找什么
What more are you looking for?

1513
01:18:21,071 --> 01:18:23,073
- 谁说我还在寻找?                      - Dylan
- Who says I'm looking for anything?  - Dylan.

1514
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:26,414
- 我不知道 但我要的不是Jamie
- 为什么 因为你们很合拍?
- I don't know, but it's not Jamie.
- Why, because you're great together?

1515
01:18:26,744 --> 01:18:28,337
因为你们是好朋友?
Because you're actually
friends with each other?

1516
01:18:28,412 --> 01:18:30,881
因为这是我见过的最快乐的你?
Because this is the happiest
I have ever seen you?

1517
01:18:30,956 --> 01:18:33,835
我不知道该说些什么 反正她不适合我 我不喜欢真心喜欢她
I don't know what to tell you. She's not for me.
I don't like her like that.

1518
01:18:33,918 --> 01:18:37,422
- 你足够喜欢她 所以才和她上床
- 只是生理需求而已
- You liked her enough to have sex with her.
- It's just physical.

1519
01:18:37,504 --> 01:18:40,383
- 就像打网球
- 我搞不懂你这套网球理论 Dylan
- Like playing tennis. 
- I don't even know what that means, Dylan.

1520
01:18:40,466 --> 01:18:43,015
自从你弄了那个玉米糖纹身之后我就没见你这么傻过了
I haven't seen you this dumb
since you got that candy corn tattoo.

1521
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:45,433
那是闪电! 超能力
It's a lightning bolt! With extra powers!

1522
01:18:45,512 --> 01:18:47,606
Dylan 你都说不出她有什么不好的地方
Dylan, you can't name
one thing that's wrong with her.

1523
01:18:47,765 --> 01:18:50,894
我不可能跟她约会 她真是一团糟
I can never go out with her.
She's too fucked up.

1524
01:18:50,976 --> 01:18:52,899
她不需要男朋友
Okay, she doesn't want a boyfriend.

1525
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:54,150
她情感很受伤
She's too damaged.

1526
01:18:54,271 --> 01:18:56,319
夏威夷神探都解决不了她的问题
Magnum P.l. couldn't solve
the shit going on in her head.

1527
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:58,659
哇 你说了一大堆 却都不承认
Wow. You'll say anything right now

1528
01:18:58,776 --> 01:19:00,323
你们其实是天生一对
not to admit that
you're perfect for each other.

1529
01:19:00,444 --> 01:19:02,321
- 为什么我还要跟你聊这个话题
- 因为我是对的
- Why am I still having this conversation?
- Because I'm right.

1530
01:19:02,446 --> 01:19:04,119
- 说得真好 Annie     - Dylan
- Good talk, Annie.  - Dylan.

1533
01:19:28,347 --> 01:19:29,815
- 科比太神奇了!
- Kobe Bryant is incredible.

1534
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:33,269
- 男人啊 就是钟情于体育
- You're men. You like sports. You're men.

1535
01:19:33,352 --> 01:19:35,229
嘿 我们正等你呢
Hey! We were waiting for you.

1536
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:36,943
我刚接到了纽约那边的电话
I actually got a call from work.

1537

So, thank you again. I'm sorry I gotta go.

1548
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:07,102
- 让Dylan送你去         - 恩
- Let Dylan drive you.  - Yeah.

1549
01:20:07,177 --> 01:20:10,021
- 路上带点东西吃吗?
- 我把你一分为二怎么样?
- Do you wanna take some food to go?
- Do you want me to saw you in half?

1550
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:13,434
下半身去纽约工作 上半身继续留在这
You can send your bottom part to New York
and your top half can stay here.

1551
01:20:14,893 --> 01:20:17,897
或者你就干脆留下
Or the whole of you could stay.

1552
01:20:18,022 --> 01:20:19,740
行了 对不起 我得走了
Okay, I'm sorry. I gotta go.

1553
01:20:32,119 --> 01:20:33,541
Jamie

1554
01:20:41,045 --> 01:20:43,594
她走了 上了辆出租车
She's gone. She hopped in the cab.

1555
01:20:50,888 --> 01:20:53,266
- 我们吃饭吧 饿了吧?                   - 是啊

By the way, why did you take
your door off its lovely hinges?

1563
01:21:48,862 --> 01:21:51,285
这很蠢啊 老兄 我从管理学的书上看到的
It was dumb, man.
Something I saw in a management book.

1564
01:21:51,448 --> 01:21:55,203
噢 好吧 这就是巴菲特是怎么发财的
Oh, right, right.
Like, that's how Warren Buffett got rich.

1565
01:21:55,285 --> 01:21:57,037
他把门都拆了
He took doors off of things.

1566
01:21:57,121 --> 01:21:59,123
嘿 人人都想要一条生活的捷径
Hey, everybody wants a shortcut in life.

1567
01:21:59,206 --> 01:22:02,050
我的手册很简单 想减肥?
My guidebook is very simple.
You wanna lose weight?

1568
01:22:02,209 --> 01:22:03,381
别吃高脂肪食物
Stop eating, fatty.

1569
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:04,628
想赚钱?
You wanna make money?

1570

你想快乐?
You wanna be happy?

1572
01:22:08,006 --> 01:22:10,225
找个你喜欢的人 怎么都别开他的放手
Find someone you like and never let him go.

1573
01:22:10,467 --> 01:22:13,471
或者说她的手 如果你起了鸡皮疙瘩的话
Or her, if you're into
that Kind of creepy shit.

1574
01:22:26,316 --> 01:22:28,819

1583
01:23:04,563 --> 01:23:06,406
比起其他男友 这已经足够好了
Well, that's more than
anybody else you've dated.

1584
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:09,694
不知道 你以为我发神经没事去躲着他?
I don't know, you think maybe I keep
my worlds apart for some crazy reason?

1585
01:23:20,871 --> 01:23:23,374
我真是个混蛋
I am an asshole.

1586
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:27,136
我们正在寻找一个能带领重新设计我们网站的人
We're looking for someone
to lead the redesign of our entire website.

1587
01:23:27,211 --> 01:23:28,963
一个能使我们网站焕然一新的人
Someone to turn it completely upside down.

1588
01:23:29,046 --> 01:23:30,798
你不能告诉我你为哪个公司工作?

what company you work for?

1589
01:23:30,881 --> 01:23:33,430

- Can you get to him?
- He's still in the first year of his contract,

1599
01:23:56,073 --> 01:23:58,496
所以那不太合适吧
so that would be inappropriate.

1600
01:23:58,575 --> 01:24:00,669

Wow, right to voice mail. Didn't even ring.

1605
01:24:25,686 --> 01:24:26,938
Jamie
Jamie.

1606
01:24:28,855 --> 01:24:31,153
你怎么知道我在这
How'd you know I was up here?

1607
01:24:32,442 --> 01:24:34,285
城市里唯一收不到手机信号的地方
Only place in the city
you don't get reception.

Really? Come on, Jamie.

1611
01:24:40,284 --> 01:24:44,289
Dylan 不知道你听说没有 我真是一团糟
Well, Dylan, I don't know if you've heard,
but I am seriously fucked up.

1612
01:24:44,997 --> 01:24:48,968
夏威夷神探都帮不了我
I mean, Magnum P.I. couldn't solve
the shit going on up here.

1613
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:52,258
- 噢上帝 我很抱歉          -  我还是先去搞定我的一团糟
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.   - But I'm just gonna go

1614
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:55,637
如果还有可能的话
and try to fix the shit going on up
in my head, if that's even possible.

1615
01:24:56,300 --> 01:25:00,021
我不该说那话的 我只是想让我姐不再烦我
I shouldn't have said that.
I was just trying to get my sister off my back.

1616
01:25:00,137 --> 01:25:02,356
- 她以为我们彼此真心喜欢           - 是啊 我也这么以为的
- She thought we liked each other. - Yeah, me, too, Dylan.

1617
01:25:02,472 --> 01:25:03,473
我以为我们是好朋友
I thought we were friends.

1618
01:25:03,557 --> 01:25:06,151
但是朋友之间不该指指点点
But friends don't go
talking shit about each other,

1619
01:25:06,226 --> 01:25:09,605
这就证明了我们其实并非朋友
which must mean that you and I
were actually never friends.

1620
01:25:09,688 --> 01:25:13,113
- 你想要的不过就是为了跟我上床                  - 什么?
- That all you wanted was to get in my pants.  - What?

1621
01:25:13,191 --> 01:25:15,410
在你父亲家里 你抓住了机会
You jumped at the chance
at your dad's house.

1622
01:25:15,485 --> 01:25:16,577
你扭了脖子
You cracked your neck.

1623
01:25:16,653 --> 01:25:18,781
我以为那是信号 我们谈过的
I thought you were giving me a sign.
We talked about this.

1624
01:25:18,864 --> 01:25:20,207
噢 天哪 真的吗
Oh, my God, really?

1625
01:25:20,324 --> 01:25:22,577
你脱掉我的睡袍 记得吗
You pulled my robe off.
"Oopsy." Remember?

1626
01:25:22,659 --> 01:25:24,878
然后你偷偷摸摸出了房间
Yeah. And then you snuck out of the room.

1627
01:25:24,995 --> 01:25:26,167
记得吗
"Oopsy." Remember that?

1628
01:25:27,164 --> 01:25:30,168
你是为了我没搂着你睡觉而生气吗
Are you pissed off at me
because I didn't cuddle?

1629
01:25:32,002 --> 01:25:36,098
我们一开始不就是这么安排的吗
Isn't that why we started
this whole arrangement in the first place?

1630
01:25:36,256 --> 01:25:37,929
是你要这样的
You wanted this.

1631
01:25:40,594 --> 01:25:42,187
我?
I wanted this?

1632
01:25:43,221 --> 01:25:44,518
就我?
Just me?

1633
01:25:44,848 --> 01:25:48,148
上帝 原来你跟其他人也没什么两样
God, you are just like every other guy.

1634
01:25:48,226 --> 01:25:51,025
遗憾的是 我还以为你与众不同呢 Dylan
The sad thing is, Dylan,
I actually thought you were different.

1635
01:25:51,104 --> 01:25:53,357
有什么不同? 我又不是你男朋友 我只是普通朋友
Different from what?
I'm not your boyfriend, I'm your friend.

1636
01:25:54,191 --> 01:25:56,364
如果朋友都跟你一样 谁还需要朋友?
Well, with friends like you,
who needs friends?

1637
01:25:59,112 --> 01:26:03,538
谢谢你毁了我的宁静 
And thank you for ruining my mountaintop.

1638
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:05,706
王八蛋
Asshole.

1639
01:26:12,626 --> 01:26:14,594
嘿 老兄 你不能待在这上面
Hey, man, you can't be up here.

1640
01:26:15,462 --> 01:26:16,634
好的
Okay.

1641
01:26:16,922 --> 01:26:19,596
- 你没事吧    - 我很好
- You okay?   - I'm fine.

1642
01:26:46,243 --> 01:26:48,291
Bryce 这是给我的?
Bryce, is this for me?

1643
01:26:48,578 --> 01:26:50,956
是啊 还有这个
Yeah. And so is this.

1644
01:26:51,331 --> 01:26:53,925
 Madison 你愿意嫁给我吗
Madison, will you marry me?

1645
01:26:54,251 --> 01:26:56,174
 我愿意
You bet your ass, Flapjack!

1646
01:26:58,422 --> 01:27:00,675
- 我爱纽约           - 我爱你
- I love New York.   - I love you.

1647
01:27:01,425 --> 01:27:03,302
噢 天哪 看 帝国大厦
Oh, my God.
Look, the Empire State Building.

1648
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:04,682
哇
Wow.

1649
01:27:04,761 --> 01:27:06,354
看 自由女神像
Oh, look, the Statue of Liberty.

1650
01:27:13,687 --> 01:27:15,109
你好 我是Jamie
Hello, this is Jamie.

1651
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:18,863
什么意思 他们要直接跟他接触?
What do you mean they went to him directly?

1652
01:27:19,943 --> 01:27:21,445
他会接受吗
Well, is he gonna take it?

1653
01:27:21,611 --> 01:27:24,706
不 不 不 我能搞定 我马上给他打电话
No, no, no, no, no. I'll handle it.
I'll call him right now.

1654
01:27:24,781 --> 01:27:25,953
好吧
Okay.

1655
01:27:29,703 --> 01:27:31,455
嘿 这是Dylan 请留言
Hey this is Dylan. Leave a message.

1656
01:27:39,838 --> 01:27:41,511
我能帮你什么忙吗
Excuse me. May I help you?

1657
01:27:41,715 --> 01:27:43,763
你好 Dylan在哪?
Oh, hi. Where's Dylan Harper?

1658
01:27:43,842 --> 01:27:45,469
他在拍运动版封面
He's at a photo shoot for the sports issue.

1659
01:27:45,969 --> 01:27:49,223
是啊 拍封面 在哪拍?
That's right. The photo shoot.
Where was that again?

1660
01:27:49,473 --> 01:27:50,565
不好意思 你是谁?
I'm sorry. Who are you?

1661
01:27:51,308 --> 01:27:52,480
一个模特
One of the models.

1662
01:27:53,185 --> 01:27:55,313
我的身体很完美
I have the perfect body for Photoshop.

1663
01:27:55,812 --> 01:27:59,407
五官玲珑有致 身材修长 
Yeah, this gets more angular,
these get longer,

1664
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:01,822
很有基督徒气质
and this gets way more Christian.

1665
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:04,413
所以 他在哪?
So where did you say he was again?

1666
01:28:05,489 --> 01:28:08,868
体育运动是连接这个世界的最后一根纽带 老兄
Sports is the last chance we have
of bringing our world together, bro.

1667
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:12,083
所以我想拍一些照片
So I just wanted to shoot some photos
that speak to that,

1668
01:28:12,162 --> 01:28:14,540
来让所有人类都为体育运动而团结一心
to the unification of all people
through sports.

1669
01:28:14,664 --> 01:28:16,041
好了 大家伙 我们开始
Okay, guys. Let's go.

1670
01:28:16,666 --> 01:28:17,838
就是那样
That's it.

1671
01:28:18,376 --> 01:28:19,593
漂亮
Beautiful.

1672
01:28:19,753 --> 01:28:21,471
好的 现在请大家肩并肩
Okay, now put your arms around each other,

1673
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:23,890
就像喜欢对方一样
like you like each other,
like you love each other.

1674
01:28:24,257 --> 01:28:26,510
- 太基了?     - 有点
- Too gay?   - A little bit.

1675
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:28,888
放几个女孩子进去
Throw some girls in there.

1676
01:28:29,012 --> 01:28:31,356
去吧 女孩们
Come on, ladies. Hop to.

1677
01:28:32,933 --> 01:28:36,233
女孩们 来吧 加入进去
Girls, girls. Okay, look. Just blend in.

1678
01:28:36,686 --> 01:28:38,905
好的 男生女生各就各位
Okay, let's go boy, girl, boy...

1679
01:28:39,022 --> 01:28:40,865
- Dylan
- Dylan.
- ...boy, boy, boy, boys.

1680
01:28:41,691 --> 01:28:43,534
- 你来这干嘛                - 你面试了另一份工作!
- What are you doing here? - You met for another job!

1681
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:46,363
- 怎么 你想要跳槽?
- 我不知道 我去见了个面
- What, are you gonna leave now?
- I don't know. Yeah, I took one meeting.

1682
01:28:46,446 --> 01:28:48,869
- 难以置信               - 过来
- I can't believe you.  - Come here.

1683
01:28:49,908 --> 01:28:52,002
- 这是你复仇的方式吗?                        - 什么?
- Is this your way of getting back at me?   - What?

1684
01:28:52,077 --> 01:28:54,205
你知道如果一年未满你就走了 我就完了 
You know that if you leave
before a year is up, I get screwed.

1685
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:55,922
噢 是嘛
Oh, right.

1686
01:28:56,039 --> 01:28:57,256
如果我真的辞职
If I did leave,

1687
01:28:57,374 --> 01:29:00,173
还不确定 只是我只是去见了个面而已
which I don't know yet
because all I did was take one meeting,

1688
01:29:00,252 --> 01:29:02,095
我也会把奖金给你 
I'd write you a check for your bonus.

1689
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:05,758
不管怎样 我都会赔偿你的损失 高兴了吧? 没事了吧?
Whatever it is, I'll pay for it.
Happy now? We good?

1690
01:29:06,049 --> 01:29:08,222
- 为什么你不告诉我你去找新工作了
- 个人隐私
- Why didn't you tell me you were looking?
- That's personal.

1691
01:29:08,301 --> 01:29:10,599
何况我们已经不是朋友 你说得很清楚了
And we're not friends any more.
You made that pretty clear.

1692
01:29:12,138 --> 01:29:15,813
我只是想和你上床而已 记得吗
See, all I wanted to do
was have sex with you. Remember?

1693
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,153
假装你是我最好的朋友
Pretend you were the best
friend I'd ever had.

1694
01:29:18,228 --> 01:29:20,071
假装从未对其他人那样 向你打开心扉
Open up to you
like I've never done with anyone ever.

1695
01:29:20,397 --> 01:29:23,742
然后我们没继续上床了 我邀请你到
And then when the sex stopped,
invite you to LA for the weekend

1696
01:29:25,318 --> 01:29:26,786
洛杉矶 向我的家人介绍你
to introduce you to my family.

1697
01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:30,744
- 拿到那份工作 我会给你寄支票的              - 不麻烦你了
- I'll send you a check if I take the job.  - Don't bother.

1698
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:37,835
把他抬起来
Why don't you pick him up?

1699
01:29:38,248 --> 01:29:40,842
是的 抬起来
Yeah. Just pick him on up.

1700
01:29:41,126 --> 01:29:43,254
你真像个小救世主
Oh, you little Christ figure, you!

1701
01:30:07,444 --> 01:30:09,788
- 嘿
- 老爸会过来纽约吧?
- Hey, Dyl.
- Dad's coming into Newark Airport, right?

1702
01:30:09,863 --> 01:30:11,615
是啊 我们这边9点的时候他就出发
Yeah, he leaves at 9:00 our time.

1703
01:30:11,781 --> 01:30:14,625
9点.. 那就是5小时的飞机 3小时的时差 
9:00. So it's a five-hour flight,
three-hour time difference,

1704
01:30:14,701 --> 01:30:17,329
所以他到这就是32点了
so he gets in at 32:00

1705
01:30:17,454 --> 01:30:20,458
是5点 记得5点到 Dylan
5:00. Be there at 5:00, Dylan.

1706
01:30:20,707 --> 01:30:22,675
对 爸爸怎么样
Right. How is Dad?

1707
01:30:24,336 --> 01:30:26,839
越来越糟糕了
He's lost more often than not now.

1708
01:30:26,963 --> 01:30:29,967
但有时候又思维很清晰 说不定的
But then he has these moments
of real clarity. It's hit or miss.

1709
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:31,222
- 好吧    - Jamie如何
- Okay.   - How's Jamie?

1710
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:35,313
- 已经结束了     - 噢 Dylan
- That's over.   - Oh, Dylan!

1711
01:30:35,472 --> 01:30:38,521
- 好了 别再说了       - 别犯傻啊
- Okay, we're done.   - Don't be an idiot, please.

1712
01:30:38,642 --> 01:30:40,986
谢谢 Annie 明天我会去机场接老爸的
Thank you, Annie.
I'll pick up Dad tomorrow at the airport.

1713
01:30:41,061 --> 01:30:42,813
- 32点准时       - 爱你
- 32:00 sharp.  - I love you.

1714
01:30:46,483 --> 01:30:47,860
我不知道到底怎么了
I don't know what it is.

1715
01:30:47,984 --> 01:30:50,487
我就是没办法重新振作起来
I just can't get myself
to start looking for a replacement for him,

1716
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:51,662
再找一个替代他的人
assuming that he leaves.

1717
01:30:51,738 --> 01:30:54,958
- 你想要充满母爱的建议吗?
- 不想
- Do you want some motherly love advice?
- Not really.

1718
01:30:55,033 --> 01:30:56,785
太好了 因为也不知道怎么说
Oh, good, 'cause I don't know
how to do that.

1719
01:30:56,868 --> 01:31:00,463
我只知道现在你
What I do know is that
it's no great goddamn secret

1720
01:31:00,538 --> 01:31:03,257
就是怕会变得跟我一样
you live in fear of repeating my mistakes.

1721
01:31:03,333 --> 01:31:05,427
如果我没做错的话 那就跟我学吧
And you're not wrong, so learn from me.

1722
01:31:05,669 --> 01:31:08,673
你知道在辈子我所认为的完美的男人有多少个吗
Do you know how many men in my life
I thought were really perfect?

1723
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,006
- 80       - 1
- Eighty.  - One.

1724
01:31:10,173 --> 01:31:11,846
- 81?          - 就1个
- Eighty-one?  - One.

1725
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:14,519
就是你老爸 我遇到过的最好的男人
It was your dad. Greatest man I ever met.

1726
01:31:14,594 --> 01:31:16,267
很明显啊 看看你自己
Obviously. Look at you.

1727
01:31:16,346 --> 01:31:19,566
多么聪明善良风趣积极
How smart you are, how great,
how funny, how driven.

1728
01:31:19,683 --> 01:31:21,026
透着隐约的中东气质
Your vaguely Middle Eastern beauty.

1729
01:31:21,101 --> 01:31:23,854
我很肯定这不是从我这遗传的
Sure as hell didn't all come from me.

1730
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:26,281
好吧 但是说真的 妈
Okay, but, seriously, Mom,

1731
01:31:26,356 --> 01:31:28,700
你真的不记得我爸爸是哪里人吗
do you really not remember
where my dad's from?

1732
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,527
或者说你不想说呢
Or is it like a coping mechanism?

1733
01:31:30,610 --> 01:31:32,408
- 都有吧             - 好吧
- A little of both.  - Okay.

1734
01:31:32,529 --> 01:31:35,032
只能说我很肯定他是欧亚混血
But I'm pretty sure he's Eurasian.

1735
01:31:36,199 --> 01:31:39,874
我的意思是 我们都会等到我们的白马王子 
你只需要知道他现在在你身边 而不是他从哪里来啊
I mean, we all have our Prince Charming,
you just gotta know him when you see him.

1736
01:31:40,036 --> 01:31:42,539
妈 这可是白马王子啊 你当然得知道啊
Mom, it's Prince Charming.
You should just know.

1737
01:31:42,622 --> 01:31:45,876
得了 你的白马王子又不是驾着四轮马车来拯救你的
Well, your Prince Charming isn't coming
to rescue you in a horse and carriage.

1738
01:31:45,959 --> 01:31:47,632
你不想我想啊
That's not who you want.

1739
01:31:47,711 --> 01:31:51,636
我意思是 你在寻找一个伴侣
I mean, you're looking for a man
to be your partner.

1740
01:31:52,549 --> 01:31:54,267
一起生活的
To take on the world with.

1741
01:31:54,384 --> 01:31:57,137
你不能还活在老套的童话故事里 宝贝
You gotta update your fairytale, baby.

1742
01:31:57,762 --> 01:31:59,605
我的白马王子?
My Prince Charming?

1743
01:32:00,306 --> 01:32:01,649
你
You.

1744
01:32:01,808 --> 01:32:02,900
妈
Mom.

1745
01:32:25,165 --> 01:32:28,760
- 嘿      -  轮椅哈? 好像我是个残废似的
- Hey.    - A wheelchair. Like I'm an invalid.

1746
01:32:28,918 --> 01:32:30,465
- 飞行如何?             - 我饿了
- How was the flight?   - I'm hungry.

1747
01:32:30,587 --> 01:32:32,305
长途都不提供餐点了?
You know they don't serve food
in coach any more?

1748
01:32:32,422 --> 01:32:34,675
这些飞机都是自己飞的 知道吗
You'd think with these new planes,
they practically fly themselves,

1749
01:32:34,758 --> 01:32:37,307
把付给飞行员的钱拿来提供热的午餐啊
they could get rid of a pilot
and use his salary for a hot lunch.

1750
01:32:37,427 --> 01:32:39,850
- 我知道 我们这就去吃点东西                  - 上帝
- I know, right? Let's get you some food.   - God.

1751
01:32:40,305 --> 01:32:42,524
飞机都这么先进了
The engineering on these planes
is so advanced.

1752
01:32:42,599 --> 01:32:43,816
完全电脑控制的
Completely computerized.

1753
01:32:43,933 --> 01:32:45,935
- 就跟玩游戏一样                     - 是啊
- It's like playing a video game.   - Exactly.

1754
01:32:46,102 --> 01:32:48,946
上帝啊 我们等了多久了 真是荒谬
God. How long have we been waiting here?
It's ridiculous.

1755
01:32:49,105 --> 01:32:51,153
我马上就回 
I'll be right back, okay?

1756
01:32:53,943 --> 01:32:55,991
不好意思 我们已经等了很久了
Excuse me. We've been waiting a while.

1757
01:32:56,112 --> 01:32:57,785
- Harper     - 是的 是的 有你的名字
- Harper.    - Yeah, I got you. I got you.

1758
01:32:57,864 --> 01:32:59,491
但我得按顺序来安排座位
I have to seat people
in the order they came.

1759
01:32:59,616 --> 01:33:01,539
完全理解 但是我老爸
I totally understand that,
but I'm with my dad

1760
01:33:01,618 --> 01:33:03,495
- 他状况不太好                      - 对不起
- and he's not in the best shape.  - I'm sorry.

1761
01:33:03,661 --> 01:33:05,459
能想想办法腾一张桌子出来吗
Is there no way we could,
like, squeeze a table?

1762
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:08,379
抱歉 不行 我得按照名单来
No, I gotta go by the list. Sorry.

1763
01:33:12,295 --> 01:33:13,467
爸爸?
Dad?

1764
01:33:20,303 --> 01:33:21,475
爸爸?
Dad?

1765
01:33:22,806 --> 01:33:24,308
爸爸?
Shit. Dad?

1766
01:33:37,028 --> 01:33:38,496
要一起吗?
You gonna join me?

1767
01:33:48,206 --> 01:33:49,833
当然
Absolutely.

1768
01:33:54,546 --> 01:33:56,344
很抱歉 先生 你不能这样..
Excuse me, sir.
I'm sorry, you cannot do this.

1769
01:33:56,422 --> 01:33:58,641
请来一份中号牛排
Could I get a steak, medium, please?

1770
01:33:58,716 --> 01:34:00,684
- 先生 我们这只有烤肉               - 我也来一份牛排
- Sir, this is the Daily Grill.    - Make that two.

1771
01:34:09,853 --> 01:34:11,230
Dede Dede!
Dede? Dede!

1772
01:34:20,196 --> 01:34:21,368
爸
Dad.

1773
01:34:21,865 --> 01:34:23,208
爸
Dad.

1774
01:34:27,036 --> 01:34:28,128
谁是Dede啊?
Who is Dede?

1775
01:34:28,913 --> 01:34:33,214
老天 在海军的时候我认识的一个女孩
Jesus. She's just a girl
that I met in the Navy.

1776
01:34:34,294 --> 01:34:35,716
她是
Was...

1777
01:34:38,214 --> 01:34:39,807
她是我的一生挚爱
She was the love of my life.

1778
01:34:41,384 --> 01:34:42,431
知道吧?
Okay?

1779
01:34:43,553 --> 01:34:44,896
怎么你没跟我说起过她
Why didn't you tell me about her before?

1780
01:34:45,054 --> 01:34:47,898
这不是能和孩子们谈的话题
This is not something
you discuss with your children.

1781
01:34:47,974 --> 01:34:50,853
况且 我有你和Annie 一生无憾了
And besides, I have you and Annie.
I have no regrets.

1782
01:34:50,935 --> 01:34:51,982
那现在告诉我吧
So tell me now.

1783
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:55,607
她是我最爱的人
She was the love of my life.

1784
01:34:55,732 --> 01:34:56,984
当时我太蠢居然没意识到
And I was too stupid to realize it,

1785
01:34:57,066 --> 01:35:00,161
因为一些愚蠢的事我失去了她
and I lost her because of something
so dumb I don't even remember.

1786
01:35:00,904 --> 01:35:02,326
至今我还忘不了她
And I never really got over her.

1787
01:35:02,906 --> 01:35:06,661
我想这也可能是为什么你母亲会离开
And I think that may be
one of the reasons your mom left.

1788
01:35:07,911 --> 01:35:11,461
知道吗 我朋友以前常说我和Dede四目相对时
You know, my friends used to say that
when Dede and I looked at each other,

1789
01:35:11,581 --> 01:35:12,753
都能放出电来
it was electric.

1790
01:35:12,832 --> 01:35:14,084
但我却没珍惜她
And I let her go.

1791
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:15,843
放开了她的手
I just let her go.

1792
01:35:15,919 --> 01:35:19,469
因为我太傲慢以至于不能告诉她我对她真正的感觉
Because I was too damn proud
to tell her how l really felt about her.

1793
01:35:20,173 --> 01:35:22,767
当我是你这么大的时候 我真希望我也能明白的一个道理
I'll tell you something that I wish
I knew when I was your age.

1794
01:35:22,926 --> 01:35:24,769
或许你已经听了N遍了 那就是"人生苦短"
And I know you've heard
a million times, "life is short."

1795
01:35:24,844 --> 01:35:28,439
他教会了我
But let me tell you something,
what this is teaching me

1796
01:35:28,514 --> 01:35:31,643
人生苦短 你不能浪费一分一秒
is that life is goddamn short
and you can't waste a minute of it.

1797
01:35:34,270 --> 01:35:36,113
对不起 对不起
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1798
01:35:40,610 --> 01:35:44,456
我带回来洛杉矶的女孩 Jamie?
The girl I brought home to LA, Jamie?

1799
01:35:44,530 --> 01:35:47,204.
- 是啊 你跟她怎么了?                - 我想我搞砸了
- Yeah, what's going on with her? - I think I messed it up.

1800
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:49,293
- 修复它      - 她不愿意跟我说话了
- Fix it.    - She won't talk to me.

1801
01:35:49,619 --> 01:35:51,747
可能她至少还会听 总有办法的
Maybe she'll listen. There's always a way.

1802
01:35:51,829 --> 01:35:56,505
如果你觉得她还有机会成为你的一生挚爱 就去挽回她
If you think there's even a chance
that she could be it, you fix it.

1803
01:35:58,628 --> 01:35:59,880
Annie让你来劝我的?
Did Annie put you up to this?

1804
01:36:00,630 --> 01:36:01,802
谁是Annie?
Who's Annie?

1805
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:03,512
开玩笑呢
I'm kidding.

1806
01:36:03,633 --> 01:36:05,931
怎么 我就不能说笑话?
What, I can't joke about this?

1807
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:08,513
- 天哪 老爹            - 我只是不知道怎么做了
- Jesus Christ, Dad.   - I don't know what else to do.

1808
01:36:10,348 --> 01:36:11,474
我们走吧
Let's go.

1809
01:36:11,849 --> 01:36:13,897
牛排不吃完了?
You don't want to finish your steak?

1810
01:36:13,977 --> 01:36:16,856
去他的机场 去他的牛排  走!
We're eating in the goddamn airport.
I can leave the steak. Come on.

1811
01:36:17,355 --> 01:36:21,326

Yeah, hey, this is Dylan Harper from GQ.
We meta few weeks ago at the...

1812
01:36:21,401 --> 01:36:23,870
对 对 嘿 能请你帮个忙吗
Right. Hey, can I ask you a huge favor?

1813
01:36:24,195 --> 01:36:26,664
- 真对不起 先生        - 我的错
- I am so sorry, sir.  - It's my fault.

1814
01:36:26,739 --> 01:36:28,286
- 吓到我了
- 不 不 我的错才是 你没事吧
- You just scared me.
- No, no. My fault. You all right?

1815
01:36:28,366 --> 01:36:29,868
- 是的 我没事        - 来 我来帮你
- Yeah, I'm good.   - Here, let me help you with that.

1816
01:36:29,993 --> 01:36:32,587
- 谢谢 你真好心
- 好的 祝你旅途顺利
- Thanks, man. You're really nice.
- All right. Hey, safe travels.

1817
01:36:32,662 --> 01:36:34,164

- All right, thanks, man.  - Okay, thank you.

1818

开什么玩笑 来打一架吧
You gotta be fucking kidding me.
All right, let's dance, Clowny Brown.

1819
01:36:38,918 --> 01:36:41,592
- 我怎么惹你了?
- 我看见你跟Jamie一起在酒吧
- What's your problem with me?
- I saw you at that bar with Jamie.

1820
01:36:41,838 --> 01:36:45,433
怎么那么好的女孩会跟着你 而不是帅气的我呢
How could such an awesome girl
be with this over this?

1821
01:36:46,175 --> 01:36:49,019
我已经喜欢她很多年了
I've been trying to take that little monkey
to pound-town for years.

1822
01:36:49,512 --> 01:36:51,355
- 我会向她转告你的问候            - 什么?
- I'll tell her you say hello.   - What?

1823
01:36:51,556 --> 01:36:53,604
你头发有点乱 帮你弄好了
You missed a little. There you go.

1824

我就把你宰了炖汤
I'll crush your earlobes
and make soup stock out of them.

1827
01:36:59,522 --> 01:37:01,524

- You have a vivid imagination.  - I do!

1828

- What's the matter with her?  - I don't know.

1830
01:37:10,033 --> 01:37:13,378
天哪 我以为洛杉矶以后够差的了 这里更糟糕
God! I thought LA was bad.
This traffic is terrible.

1831
01:37:13,536 --> 01:37:14,788
还有没有其他办法去市里啊
Is there another way into the city?

1832
01:37:25,214 --> 01:37:27,308
欠你个大人情 Tommy
I owe you big time, Tommy.

1833
01:37:27,383 --> 01:37:31,763
你要报答我哦 事实上 我也正要去市里
You'll make it up to me.
Actually, I was heading into town anyway.

1834

- You okay, Dad?  - Are you kidding?

1836
01:37:39,062 --> 01:37:42,362

My number. Here's the remote.

我朋友Dave住对面 他的微波炉坏了 所以他会借用我的厨房
My friend Dave from across the hall, his
oven broke, so he'll be using the kitchen.

1842
01:38:01,501 --> 01:38:04,846
你朋友到底是来用厨房还是看着我?
Your friend Dave is here using the kitchen
or watching me?

1843
01:38:05,254 --> 01:38:06,597

"How to wear white pants to a cookout."

1846
01:38:10,426 --> 01:38:13,521
多么经典的文章呀
Did you scoop the Times on this?
I smell Pulitzer.

1847
01:38:14,097 --> 01:38:15,314
好吧 好吧
All right, all right.

1848
01:38:15,431 --> 01:38:16,853
替我向她问好
Just say hello to her for me, will you?

I'm standing right by the guy in the tie.

- 那就直接找我在哪吧
- There are a million guys in ties.
- So look for the guy I'm standing next to.

1857
01:38:40,623 --> 01:38:43,467
你这么做 到底要教我什么
You never do what you say you're gonna do.
When am I gonna learn?

1858
01:38:43,668 --> 01:38:45,170
等一下 宝贝
Just hang on, baby.

01:38:53,219 --> 01:38:55,142
我想我不会过去了
I don't think I'm gonna be able
to make it after al/.

1861

1866
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:32,054
Semisonic 乐队的<<Closing Time>>
It's Closing Time, by the band Semisonic!

1867
01:39:32,341 --> 01:39:34,639
不是<<Third Eye Blind>> 相信吗
It's not Third Eye Blind.
Can you believe that?

1868
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:37,518
我不是说歌? 是这所有的一切
No, no, no. Not the song. This.

1869
01:39:37,722 --> 01:39:39,724
你说让要电影般的生活
You said you wanted your life
to be like a movie.

1870
01:39:40,683 --> 01:39:44,278
不得不借用一下真的中央车站了 而不是做个假的 
Sorry I had to use the real Grand Central
instead of the fake one.

1871
01:39:51,027 --> 01:39:52,119
听着 Jamie 我
Listen, Jamie, I'm...

1872
01:39:52,195 --> 01:39:54,368
我听不见你说话!
I'm having trouble hearing you!

1873
01:39:54,447 --> 01:39:56,324
是啊 没考虑到这点
Yeah, I didn't really think this through.

1874
01:39:56,407 --> 01:39:58,751
拍电影时男人先表白
I guess in the movies
the guy pours his heart out

1875
01:39:58,868 --> 01:40:00,245
后期制作时才加的背景音乐
and they put the music in later.

1876
01:40:00,411 --> 01:40:01,583
什么?
What?

1877
01:40:04,874 --> 01:40:06,046
我搞砸了
I messed up.

1878
01:40:07,043 --> 01:40:08,545
我被吓坏了
I was scared.

1879
01:40:09,378 --> 01:40:11,096
看看我父母的结局
Look at what happened
with my mom and my dad.

1880
01:40:11,214 --> 01:40:12,306
理所当然我很害怕
Of course I was scared.

1881
01:40:13,132 --> 01:40:14,554
所以我搞砸了
So I ruined it.

1882
01:40:15,718 --> 01:40:17,516
每天发生的点点滴滴
Everything that happens in the day,

1883
01:40:17,595 --> 01:40:20,769
我都迫不及待的想告诉Jamie
all I can think to myself is,
"I can't wait to tell Jamie about this."

1884
01:40:21,766 --> 01:40:24,895
看到别人在骂人 我想到的 就是你在眨眼
When I see someone cursing,
all I picture is you blinking.

1885
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:30,325
看到有儿童从癌症中康复 我都祈祷那不是那混蛋医生治好的
And when I hear a kid's been cured of
cancer, I pray it's not by that douchebag,

1886
01:40:30,399 --> 01:40:33,323
那个甩了你的混蛋医生
tree-hugging fucking doctor
who ran out on you.

1887
01:40:33,569 --> 01:40:37,949
我想说 治好癌症固然好 但我希望是别的医生而不是他
I mean, cancer being cured is awesome,
but, you know, I wish someone else did it.

1888
01:40:38,824 --> 01:40:40,121
来吧
Come on.

1889
01:40:45,081 --> 01:40:47,425
嘿 我好想你
Hey, I miss you.

1890
01:40:47,583 --> 01:40:49,426
是啊 我也很想你
Yeah, I miss you, too.

1891
01:40:49,627 --> 01:40:51,595
但你说得对 我感情很受伤
But you're not wrong, I am damaged.

1892
01:40:51,754 --> 01:40:53,973
我也是 谁不是呢
So am I. Who isn't?

1893
01:40:54,257 --> 01:40:56,134
这才让我们很般配
That's what makes us so awesome.

1894
01:40:56,259 --> 01:40:57,932
- 还有我们的纹身     - 是啊
- And our tattoos.   - Yeah.

1895
01:41:00,096 --> 01:41:02,599
- 不 不 不      - 闭嘴 不是你想的那样
- No, no, no.  - Shut up. It's not what you think.

1896
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:05,609
Jamie 你愿意重新做我的好朋友吗?
Jamie, will you be my best friend again?

1897
01:41:06,644 --> 01:41:08,942
- 真逊啊             - 我知道
- That is so lame.   - I know.

1898
01:41:10,106 --> 01:41:11,733
白马王子的桥段 不是吗
That's some Prince Charming shit,
though, right?

1899
01:41:11,816 --> 01:41:13,033
- 起来吧     - 恩
- Get up.    - Okay.

1900
01:41:14,610 --> 01:41:17,830
听着 不和你上床 我也能继续活下去
Look, I can live without
ever having sex with you again.

1901
01:41:18,197 --> 01:41:20,040
但那会很难很难
It'd be really hard.

1902
01:41:20,491 --> 01:41:23,335
嘿 我只想和好朋友终归于好
Hey, I want my best friend back,

1903
01:41:23,619 --> 01:41:25,462
因为我爱上她了
because I'm in love with her.

1904
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:28,799
- 有个条件               - 什么都行
- Under one condition.   - Anything.

1905
01:41:30,626 --> 01:41:31,969
吻我
Kiss me.

1906
01:41:33,546 --> 01:41:36,174
- 众目睽睽之下?
- 当我没说...
- In public? In front of all these people?
- I did not ask you to...

1907
01:41:55,818 --> 01:41:57,820
大家可以回家了
You can all go home now.

1908
01:42:04,076 --> 01:42:06,044
那...
Okay. So...

1909
01:42:08,998 --> 01:42:11,171
- 现在干嘛             - 我们第一次约会
- What do we do now?  - Have our first date.

1910
01:42:11,542 --> 01:42:12,668
好吧
Okay.

1911
01:42:15,838 --> 01:42:18,933
噢 天哪 你弄了辆马车?
Oh, my God!
Did you get a horse and carriage?

1912
01:42:20,009 --> 01:42:21,852
是啊 不是给你准备的
Yeah, that's not for you.

1913
01:42:22,053 --> 01:42:25,102
噢 感谢上帝 我最怕这个了
Oh, thank God.
Horses actually scare the shit out of me.

1914
01:42:25,264 --> 01:42:26,516
- 真的?     - 是啊
- Really?   - Yeah.

1915
01:42:26,682 --> 01:42:27,934
那..你是哪里人
So, where are you from?

1916
01:42:28,017 --> 01:42:30,566
- 费城附近                      - 有意思
- Outside of Philly, actually.  - Interesting.

1917
01:42:30,770 --> 01:42:34,365
- 我刚从洛杉矶来纽约
- 有意思 都没问你呢 继续吧
- I'm from LA, just moved to New York.
- Interesting. Didn't really ask, but go on.

1918
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:37,740
什么? 我太激动了 第一次约会 所以...
What? I'm excited, I'm
on a first date. So...

1919
01:42:38,069 --> 01:42:40,242
这一点都不奇怪
This isn't weird at all.

1920
01:42:40,363 --> 01:42:42,536
- 我们没事了      - 是啊 谢谢你
- We're okay.    - Yeah. Thank you.

1921
01:42:44,909 --> 01:42:46,536
所以...
So...

1922
01:42:49,121 --> 01:42:50,714
不管了
Yeah, fuck it.
