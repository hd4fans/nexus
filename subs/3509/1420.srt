1
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:34,390
- Good night.
- Good night, Sir John.

2
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,400
Begging your pardon, sir.

3
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,950
We met on this selfsame road
the other day...

4
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:52,080
...and I said, "Good night," and
you replied, "Good night, Sir John."

5
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,120
I may have.

6
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,960
- Did so again today.
- So I did.

7
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,590
Why call me "Sir John" when I be
plain Jack Durbeyfield, the haggler?

8
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:06,890
Just a whim of mine.
I'm Parson Tringham by the way.

9
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,680
I made a discovery about you
while tracing some family trees...

10
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,600
...for our new county history.
I'm an antiquarian, you know.

11
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,940
You, Durbeyfield,
are directly descended...

12
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,570
...from the knightly house
of the d'Urbervilles.

13
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,660
- Did you really not know that?
- Never heard it before, sir.

14
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,490
Raise your head a little so that I can
see your face from the side.

15
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,790
Yes, that's the d'Urberville
nose and chin.

16
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,000
- A trifle coarser than of old, but still.
- Daze my eyes.

17
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:37,970
According to the records, your line
goes back to Sir Pagan d'Urberville...

18
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:40,640
...who came from Normandy
with William the Conqueror.

19
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,640
I've been slaving away
and living rough all these years?

20
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,100
Well, I thought you might already
know something about it.

21
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,860
It is true, I got an old silver spoon
at home and a graven seal...

22
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:56,570
...but I never paid them much heed.
Where do we d'Urbervilles live today?

23
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,370
You don't live anywhere.

24
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:04,000
You lie buried in your family vault
at Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill...

25
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,710
...laid out in lead coffins with your
effigies under marble canopies.

26
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,550
- And where be our family mansions?
- You haven't any.

27
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,970
No land neither?

28
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,680
None at all?

29
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,470
You had an abundance of land
in the old days.

30
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,390
What can I do about it, sir?

31
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,770
Well, as to that...

32
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,030
- Can I do nothing?
- Nothing whatever...

33
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,160
...save possibly chasten yourself
by thinking:

34
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,780
"How are the mighty fallen."

35
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,490
Good night...

36
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,580
...Sir John.

37
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,590
Won't you take a quart of beer
with me, sir?

38
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,810
There's a grand brew to be had
at The Pure Drop.

39
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,360
Though not so good as at Rolliver's.

40
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,740
Sir John d'Urberville.

41
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,870
That's who I am.

42
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,540
What is this?

43
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,970
- It is our club dance, sir.
- Club dance?

44
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:32,470
- But where are your partners?
- They've not finished work yet.

45
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,890
They'll be here by and by.

46
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,980
- Will you join us till then, sir?
- With pleasure...

47
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,610
...but one partner won't go far
among so many.

48
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,770
One's better than none.

49
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,900
It is sad work a-footing it
with no one to give you a squeeze.

50
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,530
Don't be so forward.

51
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,080
- What are you doing?
- I've a mind to enjoy myself. Come on.

52
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,960
You're full of nonsense.
Suppose someone sees us.

53
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,920
All right, go on. Don't wait for me.
I'll catch you up in five minutes.

54
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,140
Sir? Hey, hey, hey, sir?
Hey, sir?

55
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,860
Life has found me
a great gentleman.

56
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,570
- Noblest in the county!
- Lord, oh, Lord.

57
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,910
If it isn't your father
riding home in his cart.

58
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,960
There bain't be a man in the whole
of Wessex with finer skeletons than I!

59
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,460
Father's tired, that's all.

60
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,050
He sent for the cart
because our own horse died.

61
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,550
You know that very well.

62
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,640
Rows and rows
of knightly ancestors, I got.

63
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:55,020
Bain't be a man in the whole
of Wessex with finer skeletons than I.

64
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,180
I'm glad you've come.
Where are you off to?

65
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,060
I thought I'd change and help you.

66
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,730
You bide here. I want to tell you
what's happened.

67
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,110
We've been found to be the greatest
gentlefolk in the county...

68
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,820
...reaching back long before
Oliver Crumble's time...

69
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:41,660
...back to the days
of the pagan Turks.

70
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,450
With monuments and vaults...

71
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:48,080
...and crests and coats of arms,
and the Lord knows what all!

72
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,460
Is that why Father made such
a mommet of himself in that cart?

73
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,550
Our true name is d'Urberville.

74
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:58,510
That's why he came home in style,
not because he'd been drinking.

75
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,850
Where is he now?

76
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,020
It was a parson told him
the pedigree of the matter.

77
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,100
- But where is he now?
- Well, to tell you the truth...

78
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,530
...he was that upset, he's gone off
to Rolliver's to get up his strength.

79
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:13,450
Much strength he'll find
at the bottom of a pint pot.

80
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:17,200
Very well, I'll go and get him.
We'll be back afore you know it.

81
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:21,830
Now, look, be a good girl
and put the little ones to bed for me.

82
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,640
There it is.

83
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,680
That?

84
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:39,520
That spoon may be small,
but my family was great.

85
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:42,650
- Jack, I've got a project.
- We owned carriages, estates...

86
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,110
...and mansions without number.
- Listen to me.

87
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,740
Is there any money in it?

88
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:51,620
It is well to be kin to a coach,
even if you don't ride in one.

89
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,200
I've been thinking since
you brought me the news.

90
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,170
- I've got a project.
- Which reminds me, woman.

91
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:01,130
You better find that dang seal
of ours, or I'll do you a mischief.

92
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,470
Listen. There's a great lady
by the name of d'Urberville...

93
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,430
...living out by Trantridge.

94
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,890
Well, she's nothing compared
with us.

95
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,060
Younger branch of the family,
no doubt.

96
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,520
I'll wager they don't go back
to King Norman's day.

97
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:19,150
That's as may be, but she's rich.

98
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,610
Lot of good her money will do us.

99
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:27,120
It could do. We must send
our Tess to claim kin.

100
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,170
- Claim kin?
- Why shouldn't two branches...

101
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,040
...of the same family
be on visiting terms?

102
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:37,090
It would certainly put her
in the way of a grand marriage.

103
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:41,510
Then she ought to go there tomorrow.
Let's drink to that. Mrs. Rolliver!

104
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:46,060
There you are, my poppet.
We was just on our way.

105
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,160
But you're asking me to go begging.

106
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,950
Begging. What are you saying?

107
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:02,160
It is all in the family.

108
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:07,000
If they was in need, I should
take them in without a word.

109
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:10,960
We all have to take the ups
with the downs, Tess.

110
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,760
Now, you must go and see her...

111
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:15,800
...and ask her for some help
in our trouble.

112
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:20,770
If the lady received me at all, it
would be enough if she were friendly.

113
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,940
You must not expect her to help us.

114
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,480
Come, come, my dear.

115
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:28,490
With your pretty face,
you could coax her into anything.

116
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,490
I'd rather try to get work.

117
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,830
Durbeyfield, you decide.

118
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,790
If you say she must go, she'll go.

119
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,640
Well, girl, do you want to go visiting
this grand kinswoman of ours?

120
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,100
- I'd much sooner not, Father.
- There, she doesn't want to!

121
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:56,600
I don't like my children making
themselves beholden with strange kin.

122
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:01,650
I'm the head of the noblest branch
of the family...

123
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:05,030
...and I got my pride to think of.

124
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,540
All this bragging about your ancestors.

125
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:16,460
It isn't them as will buy us
a new horse.

126
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,790
It's all new.

127
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,950
Well, my beauty...

128
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,080
...what can I do for you?

129
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,460
- I came to see Mrs. D'Urberville.
- I'm afraid that's impossible.

130
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,250
She's an invalid.

131
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,720
What was your business with her?
I'm her son.

132
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,930
It wasn't business, it was...

133
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,690
I can hardly say what.

134
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,520
- Not business, sir, no.
- Pleasure, then?

135
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:16,860
No, sir.

136
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:20,150
It is so very foolish, I...

137
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:23,740
- I fear I can't tell you.
- Never mind.

138
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:26,040
I like foolish things.

139
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,960
Try again, dear.

140
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,750
I came, sir, to tell you that...

141
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,510
...we are of the same family as you.

142
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,510
Poor relations?

143
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:45,230
- Yes.
- Stokes?

144
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,810
No, d'Urbervilles.

145
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,520
Yes, yes, I meant d'Urbervilles.

146
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,700
Tell me...

147
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,280
...do you like strawberries?

148
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,950
- Yes, when they're in season.
- Here, they already are.

149
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,290
Our name has become Durbeyfield...

150
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,960
...but we have several proofs
that we're d'Urbervilles.

151
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,970
That's who the antiquarians
hold we are, so Mother said...

152
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,510
...we should make ourselves
beknown to you...

153
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,680
...as we've lost our horse...

154
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:19,230
...and we are the oldest branch
of the family.

155
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,270
I see.

156
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,230
So you've come to pay me
a courtesy call, really...

157
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,190
...as one relation to another.

158
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:32,830
- I suppose I have.
- Yes. Well, there's no harm in that.

159
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,920
I would rather take it
from my own hand.

160
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:47,720
Don't be so coy, my pretty cousin.

161
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,180
There.

162
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,590
Come, this one too.

163
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,760
It's the perfect place.

164
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,680
Believe me.

165
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,680
You'll look a regular posy!

166
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,520
- What's the matter?
- A thorn.

167
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:31,270
Cousin, beauty has its price.

168
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:38,660
I'm not very hungry. Truly, I'm not.

169
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,120
Nonsense.

170
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,830
You must eat something
before you go.

171
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's no mean ride
from here to your village.

172
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,560
I shall see what I can do for you.

173
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:05,810
But listen, Tess, no more
of this d'Urberville nonsense.

174
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,900
Plain Durbeyfield, understand?

175
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,280
It's quite a different name.

176
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,700
I wish for no better, sir.

177
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:21,250
"In reference to your daughter
and further to her visit...

178
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,800
...we write to inform you
of our willingness...

179
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,050
...to consider engaging her services...

180
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:33,100
...in the managing of a poultry farm
of modern character.

181
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:38,190
Lf, after a suitable period,
your daughter...

182
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:41,820
...proves satisfactory,
we should guarantee her...

183
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,900
...comfortable accommodation
and a good wage.

184
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:50,910
Your earliest reply would be
greatly appreciated."

185
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,210
So you charmed them after all,
did you?

186
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,790
Let me see that letter.

187
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,920
- Who wrote it?
- Who?

188
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:03,550
Mrs. D'Urberville, of course.
Look at the signature.

189
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,010
Me? Manage a poultry farm?

190
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,350
- I truly don't think I should go.
- Poultry.

191
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:17,070
It is just her way of getting you there
without raising your hopes too much.

192
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,110
She's going to own you as kin.

193
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,780
Hey! The seal!

194
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,660
This is it!

195
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,000
It's the same as ours.
Look at it, lad.

196
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,630
A ramping, great, big lion
with a castle on top.

197
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,630
There's no denying it, girl.

198
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,170
Mrs. D'Urberville recognized
her own flesh and blood.

199
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,260
But she never even saw me.

200
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:40,850
Well, you couldn't expect her to throw
her arms round your neck...

201
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:43,060
...her being an invalid.

202
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:48,650
But her son made you welcome.
He called you "cousin," didn't he?

203
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:52,150
I'd rather bide here with you.

204
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,560
Goodbye, Father.

205
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,400
- You're off, then?
- Yes. Goodbye, Father.

206
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:24,610
Goodbye, girl.

207
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,650
You're a comely sight.

208
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:30,620
This young cousin of yours...

209
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:34,740
...tell him that, being so come down
in the world...

210
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,170
...l'll sell him the title.

211
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,630
Yes, I'll sell it, but a fair price.

212
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,260
Not less than
a thousand pounds, mind.

213
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:47,050
That's right, tell him
I'll take a thousand pounds.

214
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,350
Well, now I come to think on it...

215
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,650
...he can have it for a hundred.
I won't stand on trifles.

216
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,230
Fifty.

217
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:01,860
Twenty pounds, tell him,
and not a penny less.

218
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,740
- Family honor is family honor.
- Come, it's time to go.

219
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,870
I want to walk a little ways
with Tess.

220
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,710
So do I, now she's leaving
to marry our gentleman cousin.

221
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,630
I'll hear no more of that.

222
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,840
Mother, how could you have put
such nonsense into their heads?

223
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:21,760
She's going to work for a rich relation,
my dears...

224
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:24,810
...and help us earn enough money
to get a new horse.

225
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:40,280
Oh, Mother, I wish our Tess
hadn't gone to be a lady.

226
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:07,270
Don't hold my arm!
Grab me round the waist!

227
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:22,380
Ungrateful little minx. Why abandon
me as soon as you feel safe?

228
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,710
The danger came of your foolishness.

229
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,300
I say, what a temper.

230
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:30,340
When people are on top of a hill,
they have to get down somehow.

231
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,300
But not at a gallop, surely.

232
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,020
Fancy being asked that
by a brave little beauty like you.

233
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:38,900
I always go downhill at a gallop.

234
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,230
You can't beat it
for stirring the blood.

235
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,190
But perhaps you needn't
do so again.

236
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,160
Perhaps not.

237
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,070
It all depends.

238
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,660
One little kiss on those ruby lips
or even on that satin cheek...

239
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,290
...and I drive at a snail's pace,
word of honor.

240
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,250
But I don't want to be kissed, sir.

241
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:04,930
Stop, stop, I beg you!

242
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:09,980
Very well, do as you wish.
I don't mind.

243
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:14,150
But I thought you'd protect me,
being a kinsman.

244
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:18,150
Kinsman be hanged.

245
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:25,910
You're mighty sensitive
for a village lass.

246
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:40,050
- Oh, my hat!
- Whoa, boy.

247
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:52,400
You look even prettier without it!

248
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:05,210
- Come along, now. Up you get.
- No, sir.

249
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,670
- You won't ride with me?
- No, I shall walk.

250
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,300
It's four miles to Trantridge, at least.

251
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:13,800
I wouldn't care if it were 20.

252
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:27,820
You watch out for Dollop, the bailiff.
He's a devil.

253
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:31,200
Not Mr. Alec. Spends half
his time on horseback...

254
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:34,040
...and the rest of it chasing
the likes of us.

255
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:38,420
His mother's a queer old soul,
but no real trouble.

256
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,090
It is a mercy for us she's blind.

257
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:46,680
- Mrs. D'Urberville's blind?
- Stone-blind.

258
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,010
Their real name is Stoke.

259
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,770
How's that?

260
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,900
It were Mr. Alec's father
had the notion.

261
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,690
He bought the name
of an old extinguished family...

262
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,230
...to make himself important.

263
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,280
Whatever are you doing?
Missus is waiting for her birds.

264
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:05,410
Quick, it slipped my mind entirely.

265
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,290
Now, you catch hold
of Phena there...

266
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,200
...and that one.

267
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,700
That one there and the white one.

268
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:05,730
So you are the new young woman.

269
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:09,440
Well, how are my birds?

270
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,460
This is Strut.

271
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:29,470
He doesn't seem so lively today,
does he?

272
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:35,140
He's alarmed at being handled
by a stranger, I suppose.

273
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,730
And Phena?

274
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:45,030
Yes, yes.

275
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:48,990
They are a little frightened.
Aren't you, my poor dears?

276
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,910
Never mind.

277
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,120
They'll soon get used to you.

278
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:55,170
Can you whistle?

279
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,340
Whistle, ma'am?

280
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:00,050
Yes, whistle tunes.

281
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,760
A little.

282
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,180
Then you will have to practice
every day.

283
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:09,270
I think a lot of my fowls, but there are
also my bullfinches to consider.

284
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:13,230
I had a young lad who whistled
to them very well, but he left.

285
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,020
They've been neglected for days.

286
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:17,740
Master Alec whistled to them
this morning, ma'am.

287
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,280
Him.

288
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:48,110
Nor art nor nature ever created
a lovelier thing than you, Cousin Tess.

289
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:52,190
To see that pretty mouth
pouting and puffing away...

290
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,320
...without producing a single note.

291
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:58,240
- It is all a part of my work, sir.
- Never mind. I'll teach you.

292
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:03,120
I won't lay a finger on you.
See? I'll stay exactly where I am.

293
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,920
Now you watch me.

294
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,720
Don't screw up your lips too tight.

295
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,760
Do it like this.

296
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:19,810
Blow gently.

297
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,440
Gently.

298
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,940
Try.

299
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,950
No, no. Try again.

300
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,960
Again.

301
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:46,800
There. You'll manage splendidly
now I've started you off.

302
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:52,180
Tell me, Tess, don't you find
my mother a little odd?

303
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,310
I hardly know her, sir.

304
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,940
Well, I'm not in her good books
at the moment.

305
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:03,490
But you should find favor
if you treat her livestock well.

306
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,170
If you meet with any difficulties...

307
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,960
...don't go to Dollop...

308
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:16,800
...come to me.

309
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:39,110
What? Don't you fancy
a dance, then?

310
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,320
I'm mortal tired.

311
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:46,370
- When are you all going home?
- Soon enough, soon enough.

312
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:53,120
Well, my beauty.

313
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,380
What are you doing here
this time of night?

314
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,290
I'm waiting for the others, sir...

315
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,710
...not being acquainted
with the road home.

316
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,340
I only have a saddle horse.
Come to the inn with me.

317
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,180
I'll hire a trap for us both.

318
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:08,350
No, no. Thank you,
but I promised to wait for them.

319
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:13,860
Very well. Silly girl.
Please yourself.

320
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:40,010
What's that creeping
down your back?

321
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,140
Well, I declare!

322
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,230
It is treacle!

323
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,060
- You dare laugh at me, you hussy.
- I can't help it.

324
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,060
No more than the others.

325
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,900
You think you're the queen
of Trantridge...

326
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,860
...just because you're first favorite
with him.

327
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,110
She never said anything.
Leave her.

328
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,950
I'll show you. I'm worth two of your
sort for all your airs and graces.

329
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,910
If I'd known what sort you were...

330
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,250
...l'd never have lowered myself
by accepting your company.

331
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:39,540
- I'll show you.
- Hey there, workfolk.

332
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:42,840
What's all the row about?

333
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,840
Quickly, jump up beside me.

334
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,280
Out of the frying pan, into the fire.

335
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,300
- Where are we?
- Passing through The Chase.

336
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,140
The Chase?

337
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:26,730
It is out of our way, surely.

338
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:30,770
This forest is one of the oldest
and loveliest in England, Tess.

339
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,940
Don't you think it deserves
to be seen...

340
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:35,440
...on a glorious God-given
night like this?

341
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,990
Yes, but...

342
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,830
No buts. There's a good girl.

343
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:44,000
I'll be honest with you.
I'm happy.

344
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:46,750
I'm trying to prolong the moment.

345
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,510
You were shivering a while back.

346
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,340
Now I can feel your warmth
against me.

347
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:57,520
- Are you still cold?
- No, not now.

348
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:01,230
I'll let my animal
walk a little further.

349
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:03,900
He'll make better progress
once he's rested.

350
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,480
Tell me...

351
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:11,240
...what news of your parents' horse?
- They have no horse.

352
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:15,080
They have since Monday last.

353
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:17,960
- Did you...?
- Forgive me for mentioning it.

354
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,210
I thought they would have
written to you.

355
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:26,130
- I don't know what to say.
- It's nothing.

356
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:30,350
I knew how important it was
for your father to have a new horse.

357
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:32,180
Really.

358
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:34,270
It's you he should thank.

359
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:37,350
I'm grateful to you.

360
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,940
Truly I am.

361
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,320
But I almost wish
you hadn't done this.

362
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,490
Yes, I almost do.

363
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,790
- Is that a reproach?
- Oh, no.

364
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:52,580
It is very kind of you, I'm sure.

365
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:57,550
I've been in torment
ever since you came to us.

366
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:04,300
- Then I'll leave tomorrow, sir.
- That's absurd.

367
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:07,310
I don't want you to leave.

368
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:10,060
That's the last thing I want.

369
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,270
Is there no hope for me?

370
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,780
None at all?

371
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,950
Tess.

372
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,950
I'm dying for you.

373
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,910
Can't you see?

374
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,230
Forgive me.

375
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,440
Oh, please forgive me.

376
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:51,940
- Are you hurt?
- No, it's nothing. Nothing.

377
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,240
You're bleeding.

378
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:02,000
Oh, my God.

379
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,210
How ever could I have
done such a thing?

380
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,610
It's me.

381
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:18,910
Don't be so foolish.
Open the door.

382
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:25,000
You'll force me
to make a noise, Tess.

383
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:30,340
My mother has sharp ears.
She'll hear.

384
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:37,930
Enough of this nonsense, darling.
Open up.

385
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,470
Why sneak away...

386
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,470
...like a thief?

387
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:15,140
And at this hour in the morning?

388
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:19,020
Nobody would've prevented
you leaving.

389
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,320
At least let me drive you home.

390
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:32,040
Unless you'd care to come back.

391
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,120
I shan't come back.

392
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:07,250
- What are you crying for?
- I was only thinking...

393
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:08,960
...I was born over there.

394
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:14,300
Well, we all have
to be born somewhere.

395
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,840
L... I wish I'd never been born.

396
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:23,470
- There or anywhere else.
- You're absurdly melancholy, Tess.

397
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,230
You can hold your own for beauty
against any woman.

398
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:27,900
Queen or commoner.

399
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:32,570
I tell you that as a practical man
who wishes you well.

400
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:36,450
If you're wise, you'll let the world
get a clearer sight of that beauty...

401
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:38,280
...before it fades.

402
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,120
Why not make the most of life?

403
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:44,620
We didn't fare so badly
together, did we?

404
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,630
- I was blinded for a while, that's all.
- That's what all women say.

405
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:51,420
How dare you talk like that?

406
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:54,890
Has it never struck you what all
women say, some women may feel?

407
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:57,970
- All right. I was wrong, I admit it.
- Please, please stop.

408
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,520
I should like to get down here.

409
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:12,990
I'm a bad lot, I suppose.
A damn bad lot.

410
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:17,620
I was born bad,
and I warrant I'll die bad.

411
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,000
Listen, Tess...

412
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:24,420
...if circumstances should arise,
do you understand?

413
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:28,340
If you're ever in the least trouble,
the least difficulty...

414
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:33,180
...just send me one line, and you shall
have whatever you need by return.

415
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:41,030
You really won't come back?

416
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,500
Goodbye, my four months' cousin.

417
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:54,130
Goodbye.

418
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:07,370
Tess?

419
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:00,490
It is no use her pretending
she hates it...

420
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:04,240
...and wishes it in the churchyard
and herself beside it.

421
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:06,080
She loves that child of hers.

422
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:10,330
Poor little mite.
It don't look long for this world.

423
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:41,120
Good evening, Durbeyfield.

424
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:44,460
- What's your business?
- My business?

425
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:49,090
The child. I must baptize it before
the Lord gathers it to his bosom.

426
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:50,880
What child are you speaking of?

427
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:53,380
All my children are baptized.
You ought to know.

428
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:56,010
Durbeyfield, don't play games
with the Almighty.

429
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:57,720
I don't play, sir, I work!

430
00:48:57,890 --> 00:49:00,390
I work! Like a beast of the field.

431
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:03,400
You can tell the Almighty that
from me.

432
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:07,980
- My baby's dying.
- You ought to have been more careful.

433
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:11,110
Like it or not, Jack,
that child was born.

434
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,120
It is here, under your own roof.

435
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,240
- Not true.
- Father, come to your senses.

436
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:17,120
For pity's sake, let the vicar in!

437
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:19,290
He shan't set foot inside this house.

438
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:22,170
Not over my dead body!

439
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,840
There's enough disgrace
on my name as it is.

440
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:31,010
O merciful God, take pity.

441
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:33,350
Take pity on him.

442
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:36,270
Send down your anger on me.

443
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,020
But have mercy on my child.

444
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,190
My child.

445
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:07,350
I should like to ask you
something, sir.

446
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,520
Well, speak, girl. I'm listening.

447
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:19,990
Each of us shares
in your sad affliction, my child.

448
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:23,080
We're all members
of the suffering body of Christ.

449
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,120
My son was baptized.

450
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:28,330
Baptized? By whom?

451
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,420
By me, last night.

452
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:34,920
What procedure did you follow?

453
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,510
I woke my little brothers
and sisters...

454
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:42,230
...and made them
kneel down to pray.

455
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:47,400
'Liza-Lu held the prayer book open.

456
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:49,110
I lit a candle.

457
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,190
And then?

458
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:57,740
Then I held my child like this
over the basin.

459
00:50:57,910 --> 00:50:59,200
Yes.

460
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:02,290
I poured some water on his forehead,
and I said:

461
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:05,090
"I baptize thee...

462
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:09,260
...in the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Ghost."

463
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:15,560
- Did you make the sign of the cross?
- Yes, I did that too.

464
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:20,310
Will it be just the same
as if you'd baptized him?

465
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:23,110
In the sight of God, I mean.

466
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,940
Yes, my dear girl.
It will be the same.

467
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,160
Then you'll give him
a Christian burial?

468
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,790
That's another matter.

469
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:35,250
Another matter? Why?

470
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:38,750
Well, that would concern
the village as a whole.

471
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,840
Not just the two of us,
you understand.

472
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,470
Won't you do it, sir?

473
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,970
Just this once?

474
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:48,760
I'm sorry.

475
00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:51,890
I beg you, please.

476
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:56,190
I told you.
It's out of the question.

477
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:00,860
Then I don't like you.

478
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:04,490
I shall never come
to your church again.

479
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:05,990
Never.

480
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,490
Never!

481
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:40,010
- Hey, Mr. Crick.
- Eh?

482
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:47,400
What, here already?
We didn't expect you afore tomorrow.

483
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,860
It is quite a step from here
to Weatherbury.

484
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:53,530
- Marlott, sir. I come from Marlott.
- Yes, Marlott.

485
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:55,910
Well, that's even further.

486
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,120
Quite sure you can stand it here?

487
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:01,370
It is comfortable enough
for rough folk...

488
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,920
...but we don't live
in a cowcumber frame.

489
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:09,260
I'm accustomed to that.

490
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:12,930
I used to know your part
of the county when I were a lad.

491
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:14,520
Good. Right you are.

492
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:17,100
Well, you'll want a rest
and a morsel of food.

493
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:20,060
I'd rather begin now,
to get my hand in.

494
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:21,900
Oh, come on.
You must be famished.

495
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:25,570
No, thank you.
A little milk will suffice.

496
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:32,120
Well, if you can swallow that,
so be it.

497
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:37,580
It is what I hain't touched for years.

498
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:44,260
It lies in my innards like lead.

499
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:57,480
To my thinking, the beasts
aren't giving all they should.

500
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:00,240
That's because there's
a new hand come amongst us.

501
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,110
I've known it happen afore.

502
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:07,950
They do say that the milk goes up
into their horns at such times.

503
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:12,000
Anyone would think we were
back in the Middle Ages.

504
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:17,460
I don't appear to be making
much progress.

505
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:20,550
Take it gentle, sir. Take it gentle.
Whoa, now.

506
00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:26,270
- It is skill that does it, not strength.
- So my aching fingers tell me.

507
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:48,000
Mrs. Crick's too proud to come
milking with us, and that's a fact.

508
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:51,510
Still, there's little enough
to wherrit about.

509
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:54,470
And we do eat like gamecocks.

510
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:57,350
No, you'll like it here.

511
00:56:57,470 --> 00:57:01,020
Mr. Crick, he's a very kindly man.

512
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:06,610
Just fancy. He has his own
family pew in church.

513
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:13,620
Dairyman Dick all the week
On Sundays, Mr. Richard Crick

514
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:37,610
Who's that playing?

515
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:40,820
Mr. Clare.

516
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:44,070
Mr. Clare.

517
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,120
Him that's learning to milk.

518
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:51,160
Angel Clare, he's called.

519
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:57,050
Angel.

520
00:57:58,090 --> 00:58:00,050
It is no common name.

521
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:06,810
He never says much to us,
more's the pity.

522
00:58:06,970 --> 00:58:08,850
Why?

523
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:11,940
Does he scorn common folk?

524
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:18,320
Quite the opposite.
He often makes mock of old families.

525
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:21,410
It is quite simple.

526
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:27,460
He's a parson's son
with a mind to be a farmer.

527
00:58:28,290 --> 00:58:33,300
He's already tried his hand
at sheep farming.

528
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:37,470
Now he's learning dairy work
with Mr. Crick.

529
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:44,980
But what does he hold against
old families?

530
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:49,190
He says they're...

531
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:55,910
...worm-eaten.

532
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,390
That be your soul trying to escape.

533
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,480
It is bread, that's all.

534
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:07,950
No, it is when you sneeze,
you're like to blow your soul away.

535
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:12,280
As I see it, no soul can leave
its mortal shell afore a body dies.

536
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:15,540
What if a man falls down
in a faint, Master Crick?

537
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:17,920
Well, that's a different matter.

538
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:25,220
The spirit bides there inside you,
but you cannot feel it.

539
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:30,890
But we can sometimes make
our souls leave our bodies.

540
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,890
How's that, then, maidy?

541
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:39,900
Only have to lie
on the grass at night...

542
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:43,400
...and look straight up
at some bright star.

543
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:48,450
And stare at it with all your might.

544
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:53,330
And by and by, you'll feel
you're falling into the sky...

545
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:56,550
...miles and miles from your body...

546
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,050
...which you'll don't seem
to need at all.

547
01:02:54,530 --> 01:02:56,330
Tess!

548
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,500
Why run away like that?

549
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:06,590
- Are you afraid?
- No, sir. Not of outdoor things. No.

550
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:10,470
- But you have your indoor fears, eh?
- Heavens, yes.

551
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:12,510
Of what?

552
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:15,350
I couldn't rightly say.

553
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:18,060
Of the milk turning sour?

554
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:19,560
No.

555
01:03:19,690 --> 01:03:22,520
Fear of life, in general?

556
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:25,070
Yes, sir.

557
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:27,990
So have I. Very often.

558
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:31,200
Life's a puzzle. Don't you think?

559
01:03:32,370 --> 01:03:34,330
Perhaps...

560
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:37,250
...now you put it that way.

561
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:54,310
It is no use. It won't take.

562
01:03:55,230 --> 01:04:00,150
If this continues, I shall have
to call on Conjurer Trendle.

563
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:02,370
I don't say I believe in him, mind.

564
01:04:02,530 --> 01:04:05,580
But if nothing else works,
I shall have to try it, shan't I?

565
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:09,460
Somebody here's in love, I'll be bound.
That can cause it, so I've heard.

566
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:13,090
Conjurer Fall,
to the side of Casterbridge.

567
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:16,090
He had the knack of it
when I was a lad.

568
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:19,470
It is a pity. He must be feeding
the worms by now.

569
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:24,230
My grandpa used to go to Conjurer
Mynterne out at Owlscombe.

570
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:26,400
But there's no folk
like him these days.

571
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:29,440
Somebody's in love, I tell you.

572
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:34,400
- What's the matter?
- The blasted butter won't come.

573
01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:36,030
- Why is that?
- To my mind...

574
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:39,450
How warm it is today.

575
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:43,580
I think I'd be better out-of-doors.

576
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:47,460
They do say it happens
when people are in love.

577
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:50,090
I remember as a girl...

578
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,370
Don't push.

579
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:24,550
He looks so sad.

580
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:29,970
Whatever can he be thinking of?

581
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:33,520
Well, not of us.
You can rely on that.

582
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:41,360
You're a fine one to talk, lzz.

583
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:45,160
- I saw you.
- What did you see?

584
01:05:45,530 --> 01:05:47,620
It was the other day.

585
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:51,120
I saw you kissing his shadow.

586
01:05:55,710 --> 01:05:58,340
Here he comes again.

587
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:01,220
Dear eyes...

588
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:05,560
Dear face...

589
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:10,270
Dear Mr. Clare.

590
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:17,030
It is terrible to think he'll never wed
any one of us.

591
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:24,250
More likely, he'll ask us to milk
his cows for so much a year.

592
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:45,440
What are we going to do?

593
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:47,730
We shall have to take
the stone-bridge road.

594
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:49,610
We'll be late.

595
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:25,400
- Doesn't he go to church?
- No, never.

596
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:28,280
I wish he would.

597
01:07:32,370 --> 01:07:34,420
You look like cats afraid of water.

598
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:37,420
Only on account
of our Sunday best, sir.

599
01:07:37,590 --> 01:07:40,300
Very well. I'll carry you
just as you are.

600
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:42,970
No, no, I'm far too heavy.

601
01:07:43,130 --> 01:07:45,640
Nonsense. I could carry
all four of you at once.

602
01:07:45,970 --> 01:07:48,390
Hold on to me. That's it.

603
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:05,740
I should put my arms around
his neck and look into his eyes.

604
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,250
There's nothing in that.

605
01:08:08,410 --> 01:08:10,670
There's a time for everything
under heaven.

606
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,960
A time to kiss and a time to cuddle.

607
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:16,340
Shame on you, lzz.
That's scripture.

608
01:08:16,470 --> 01:08:19,760
I always heed the prettiest
verses in church.

609
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:13,040
If you helped me, perhaps I could
climb along the bank.

610
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:18,500
Tess.

611
01:09:18,630 --> 01:09:22,250
I've gone to three-quarters of this
trouble for your sake alone.

612
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:04,590
She's angry. She doesn't understand.
She'll kick over the bucket.

613
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:08,180
Forgive me, my darling Tess.
I don't know what came over me.

614
01:11:09,470 --> 01:11:12,180
There's only one excuse for it.

615
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:14,560
I love you.

616
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:19,060
Yes, I love you.

617
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:40,170
Angel?

618
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:41,510
Angel.

619
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:45,350
Hello, Mercy. Forgive me.
I didn't see you.

620
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:47,470
Forgive me.

621
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,100
Welcome home.

622
01:11:49,270 --> 01:11:51,060
- How are you?
- Very well.

623
01:11:51,230 --> 01:11:54,270
God be praised. You look radiant
with health, I see.

624
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:56,360
The open air, probably.

625
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,610
Have you come to spend
the holidays with your brothers?

626
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:01,160
Are they here? I had no idea.

627
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:05,330
No, I'm only paying my parents a brief
visit to settle some urgent business.

628
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:07,120
Then I won't detain you.

629
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:11,170
I have my Bible class
to take, in any case.

630
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:13,130
Au revoir, Angel.

631
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:38,790
- Angel!
- Angel! My boy.

632
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:43,290
I apologize, Father. I had no time
to warn you of my arrival.

633
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:46,460
Perhaps you've forgotten how
to write. With a pen, remember?

634
01:12:46,590 --> 01:12:48,510
I brought you farmhouse delicacies.

635
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:51,550
Black puddings
and a bottle of mead.

636
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:53,840
Black puddings?

637
01:12:54,550 --> 01:12:56,720
It's true your mother and I
have regretted...

638
01:12:57,060 --> 01:12:59,060
...hearing so little of your news.

639
01:12:59,230 --> 01:13:00,730
You must bear with him, Father.

640
01:13:00,860 --> 01:13:03,230
Spending all his time
with sheep and cattle...

641
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:07,030
...takes one closer to nature
but further from Oxford.

642
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:08,700
I would remind you, Felix...

643
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:11,410
...that a university education
means nothing...

644
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:13,790
...unless it redounds
to the glory of God.

645
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,330
It can also redound
to the glory of man.

646
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,710
Only in the second place.

647
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:20,630
How far are you
in your apprenticeship?

648
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:23,420
It's drawing to a close.

649
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:29,560
What counts is spiritual cleanliness.
Isn't that so, Father?

650
01:13:29,770 --> 01:13:32,100
The two go together, my boy.

651
01:13:32,270 --> 01:13:34,690
Father tells us you intend
setting up on your own.

652
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:36,150
Yes.

653
01:13:36,270 --> 01:13:38,610
- In what part of the world?
- I don't know yet.

654
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:40,780
The colonies perhaps.

655
01:13:41,070 --> 01:13:42,450
Heaven preserve us.

656
01:13:42,610 --> 01:13:45,160
It would suit the type of
farming I have in mind.

657
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:48,160
- What colony?
- The choice is wide.

658
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:50,160
Or I may settle in a foreign country.

659
01:13:50,330 --> 01:13:53,790
Some places offer land to immigrants
on very favorable terms.

660
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:56,090
Brazil, for example.

661
01:13:56,260 --> 01:13:58,840
Wonders will never cease.

662
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:03,220
Nothing's settled yet.
I came here to discuss it.

663
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:05,220
That among other things.

664
01:14:05,350 --> 01:14:09,560
Shall we take a drop of good
Mrs. Crick's delicious mead?

665
01:14:12,350 --> 01:14:13,740
Oh forgive me . I forgot.

666
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:16,180
Strong drink is the root of all evil.

667
01:14:26,930 --> 01:14:28,070
Take us into your confidence.

668
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:29,740
Is it something serious?

669
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:34,450
Not serious, but something
important. The truth is

670
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:38,650
son't you think it's time
i considered marrying?

671
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:41,550
Yes indeed my boy, yes indeed.

672
01:14:41,860 --> 01:14:44,080
Your mother and I have sometimes
debated the same question.

673
01:14:44,370 --> 01:14:45,090
Really?

674
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:46,580
And what sort of wife would you favour

675
01:14:47,010 --> 01:14:48,820
for a budding farmer like myself?

676
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:51,080
Truly christian, god-fearing woman.

677
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:54,490
One who will be of help and
a comfort to you in all things.

678
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:56,120
The rest matters little.

679
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:58,070
You musn't hesitate, dear son.

680
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:00,020
Why hesitate?

681
01:15:00,590 --> 01:15:03,330
To marry your heart's desire.
Mercy Chant.

682
01:15:04,870 --> 01:15:08,160
She may be fond of over-
decorating the church and

683
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:11,330
flipparies and flowers,
scraps of lacys and so forth but

684
01:15:12,350 --> 01:15:14,330
It's merely a girl's fancies. It will pass.

685
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:17,040
Mercy's a pure and virtuous girl.

686
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:19,380
Oh yes I know she's pure and virtuous.

687
01:15:20,770 --> 01:15:24,250
But honesty compels me to
inform you that I have other plans.

688
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:26,010
Other plans?

689
01:15:26,270 --> 01:15:27,100
Very much sir.

690
01:15:27,630 --> 01:15:29,950
Mercy Chant appeals more
to you than she does to me.

691
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:33,950
I'm not disputing her merits
I'm only speaking of my own inclinations.

692
01:15:34,270 --> 01:15:35,210
My dearest boy.

693
01:15:35,730 --> 01:15:39,070
Angel.Please remember that
you are addressing your parents.

694
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:40,080
I'm aware of that.

695
01:15:41,650 --> 01:15:43,700
I already know the woman I intend to marry.

696
01:15:44,610 --> 01:15:46,720
Her name is Teresa Durbeyfield.

697
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:52,740
Father, Mother. I respect you both.

698
01:15:53,660 --> 01:15:56,230
I also respect Mercy Chant.
And have no doubt

699
01:15:56,470 --> 01:15:58,240
she'll find worthier husband with or

700
01:15:58,460 --> 01:16:03,740
without your help. As for me,
my mind is made up.

701
01:16:42,690 --> 01:16:43,480
Oh it's you...

702
01:16:43,730 --> 01:16:46,230
Tess, I want to ask you this now.

703
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:50,090
Will you be my wife?

704
01:16:52,330 --> 01:16:54,470
I love you with all my heart and soul.

705
01:17:04,230 --> 01:17:06,280
I can not be your wife.

706
01:17:08,020 --> 01:17:08,820
Don't you love me?

707
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:10,940
Oh yes yes...

708
01:17:11,990 --> 01:17:15,050
I'd rather belong to you
than anyone in the world.

709
01:17:16,270 --> 01:17:22,000
Forgive me. I can't marry you.

710
01:17:56,500 --> 01:18:00,040
It was the good lord who put
this nice young person's in your way.

711
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:01,460
You must believe that.

712
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:06,260
But with respects to your question,
I tell you quite private but

713
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:10,970
very strong. On no accounts,
say a word about your bygone trouble.

714
01:18:11,670 --> 01:18:15,040
Never a word, my girl. Least of all to him.

715
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:26,800
Tess. Why does the idea of
becoming my wife displease you?

716
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:31,250
I never said that. It would please me so much.

717
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:35,780
It's simply that I can not.

718
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:39,050
Why? Is there someone else?

719
01:18:42,610 --> 01:18:44,100
Don't i deserve to know the truth?

720
01:18:46,290 --> 01:18:46,980
Well?

721
01:18:47,820 --> 01:18:48,580
Not now

722
01:18:49,110 --> 01:18:49,840
When then?

723
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:51,090
Later.

724
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:51,990
But why?

725
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:57,320
I'll tell you when we get home.

726
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:00,520
You'll stop loving
me when you know.

727
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:04,420
Let me wait till then.

728
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:36,820
Londoners will drink it at
their breakfast tomorrow, won't they?

729
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,430
Yes but watered down,
in case it goes to their heads.

730
01:19:39,890 --> 01:19:41,900
Strangers that we have never seen.

731
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:55,780
You saw me once before.
you know that?

732
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:56,960
I did?

733
01:19:57,880 --> 01:19:59,570
You wouldn't dance with me.

734
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:01,910
It was at Marlott.

735
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:03,230
Of course!

736
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:06,640
That's incredible!

737
01:20:06,820 --> 01:20:07,650
You remember now?

738
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:09,600
Tessy!Tessy!

739
01:20:13,570 --> 01:20:14,370
Now my girl.

740
01:20:15,030 --> 01:20:20,600
Yes. I may never again be
brave enough to tell my story.

741
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,470
Then get on with your precious story.

742
01:20:23,110 --> 01:20:25,570
I was born at such and such place
and in such and such a year...

743
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:29,780
I was born at Marlott and i grew up there.

744
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:33,860
I was in the Sixth Form when I left school.

745
01:20:35,110 --> 01:20:36,910
They said that I would make a geed teacher.

746
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,060
But there was trouble in my family.

747
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:47,070
Father was no great worker.

748
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:53,230
He drank. Anyway, my parents, they...

749
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:57,410
it was then that something happened.

750
01:20:58,950 --> 01:21:01,450
Something which changed my life like.

751
01:21:05,870 --> 01:21:12,610
They discovered
that we were not Durbeyfields

752
01:21:13,180 --> 01:21:14,360
but D'Urbervilles.

753
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:17,420
WEll, go on.

754
01:21:19,450 --> 01:21:20,420
WEll, that's it.

755
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:26,080
WEll the D'Urbervilles are an old family.

756
01:21:27,310 --> 01:21:27,960
I know

757
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:37,430
On account of being of that
name my mother thought that...

758
01:21:40,850 --> 01:21:42,090
I was sent...

759
01:21:47,110 --> 01:21:49,290
-I had a...
-A what?

760
01:21:50,590 --> 01:21:52,320
I was told that you hated old families.

761
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:55,880
Is that all the trouble?

762
01:21:57,830 --> 01:22:01,380
None of that matters, Tess. Say you'll be my wife.

763
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:05,580
Say it, Tess. SAy it, my dear love!

764
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:10,590
Yes yes yes...

765
01:22:19,820 --> 01:22:22,360
my health, my simplicity.

766
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:25,910
I'm a strangeness of my situation.

767
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:28,410
I perhaps lessen my fault.

768
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:37,110
But since I've committed it I am guilty.

769
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:43,030
I must be guilty.

770
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:46,960
Because the lord sawfit to take my child.

771
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:55,110
If what I have just written,
failed to pass my lips,

772
01:22:55,770 --> 01:23:00,600
in your presence, then I have
repeated it a thousand times

773
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:07,100
in my heart. For it was the
fear of losing you forever.

774
01:23:11,150 --> 01:23:12,540
For love of you,

775
01:23:13,550 --> 01:23:17,790
Is hall conquer that fear
and bring you this letter

776
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:22,320
Once you are savoured Angel

777
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:26,700
you'll hold the rest
of my life in your hands.

778
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:34,950
I hope and I tremble. I love you.

779
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:15,840
Oh darling!

780
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:28,780
I've been assumed to put
an edge on my appetite.

781
01:24:31,050 --> 01:24:32,300
I'm starving.

782
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:41,550
Angel.

783
01:27:42,010 --> 01:27:43,890
Angel please.
I must speak to you.

784
01:27:44,310 --> 01:27:44,920
What's the matter?

785
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:49,390
I want to confess all my past faults, all of it!

786
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:52,090
Later Sweetheart.Once we are married,

787
01:27:52,420 --> 01:27:53,630
we'll tell each other everything.

788
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:56,450
I have some failings of my own to confess!

789
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:09,030
I required and charge you both

790
01:28:09,660 --> 01:28:13,480
as you all have to answer
at that dreadful day of judgement.

791
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:17,170
Let the secrets of all
hearts should be disclosed.

792
01:28:18,050 --> 01:28:19,960
If either of you know any impediments

793
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:23,740
why you may not be
lawfully joined in matrimony,

794
01:28:24,380 --> 01:28:25,970
Ye do now confess.

795
01:28:31,340 --> 01:28:34,570
Will thou have this woman
for thou wedded wife

796
01:28:35,450 --> 01:28:36,350
To live together after
god's just ordinance

797
01:28:36,870 --> 01:28:39,410
In the holiest state of matrimony,

798
01:28:40,210 --> 01:28:43,620
will thou love her, comfort her,
honour and keep her in sickness

799
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:48,350
and in health and forsaking
all other, keep thee only unto her,

800
01:28:49,050 --> 01:28:50,330
so long as ye both shall live?

801
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:52,000
I will.

802
01:29:09,790 --> 01:29:12,530
Welcome sir, welcome ma'am.

803
01:29:13,410 --> 01:29:16,120
Mr Plunkit told me to make ye at home.

804
01:29:16,750 --> 01:29:19,350
The rooms, they are ready.
They are on the first floor.

805
01:29:19,710 --> 01:29:23,710
Mr Plunkit had to leave for Manchester
so you'll have the whole house

806
01:29:24,090 --> 01:29:28,960
to yourselves. I hope you
are very comfortable here.

807
01:29:29,310 --> 01:29:32,720
The house is inclined to be
damp but I put a good fire

808
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:36,160
in the drawing room and
leave it the afternoon.

809
01:29:36,410 --> 01:29:41,040
As for food, look, I've prepared
you a cold supper and maybe

810
01:29:41,290 --> 01:29:43,340
there's a nice bottle of wine to go with it!

811
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:48,240
Tomorrow, if you wish, I'll
bring you some of my husband's

812
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:51,470
excellent cider. He makes it himself.

813
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:56,980
Oh... oh... to use your ups...

814
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:02,130
The... bedroom!

815
01:30:06,830 --> 01:30:08,670
A bit of surprise, love.

816
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:11,520
I've totally prepared...

817
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:13,120
my son picked it in the bush.

818
01:30:13,790 --> 01:30:15,380
Oh... it's a good bed.

819
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:18,380
I think you'll find that you like it.

820
01:30:19,390 --> 01:30:21,230
now i'll leave you to yourselves.

821
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:22,800
cheerio…

822
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:33,440
Which are my hands and which are yours?

823
01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:36,540
They are all yours.

824
01:31:05,740 --> 01:31:08,590
Open it. It's for you.

825
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:25,990
Family jewels.

826
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:28,980
Is this for me?

827
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:30,370
Of course.

828
01:31:32,610 --> 01:31:33,470
Truly?

829
01:31:36,050 --> 01:31:39,600
Put them on. Put them on now.

830
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,950
Oh god, how beautiful you are.

831
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:32,560
Come and see.

832
01:32:52,790 --> 01:32:54,550
I have a confession to make my love.

833
01:32:58,670 --> 01:32:59,950
You have something to confess?

834
01:33:00,370 --> 01:33:03,600
Why not? You think far too highly of me.

835
01:33:04,790 --> 01:33:08,090
Now listen. I want you to forgive me.

836
01:33:09,140 --> 01:33:12,200
And not be angry with me
for failing to tell you earlier.

837
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:15,290
This is nothing for fear of losing you.

838
01:33:18,540 --> 01:33:19,640
I shall be brief.

839
01:33:32,250 --> 01:33:36,140
Not long before we met,
I lived in London for a time.

840
01:33:37,710 --> 01:33:44,390
There, I met a woman older
than myself. Ours was a flase

841
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:51,800
relationship. A sad one.
It was all over in a few weeks.

842
01:33:57,790 --> 01:33:59,140
That's all there is to tell.

843
01:34:01,900 --> 01:34:02,800
Do you forgive me?

844
01:34:04,230 --> 01:34:07,810
Angel, oh, Angel.

845
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:11,400
You are so utterly good and gentle

846
01:34:11,750 --> 01:34:13,030
I was mad to fear you'll hate me.

847
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:17,140
I have a confession too Angel.
Something of a same kind.

848
01:34:17,320 --> 01:34:18,870
Well, tell me at table. WE'll talk over supper.

849
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:19,880
I'm hungry, aren't you?

850
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:24,300
I told you. I have a confession like your own.

851
01:34:25,140 --> 01:34:26,390
What confession?

852
01:34:28,870 --> 01:34:30,040
I shall be just as brief.

853
01:34:40,460 --> 01:34:43,860
His name is D'Urberville like mine.

854
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:47,030
Alexander D'Urberville.

855
01:34:50,580 --> 01:34:52,630
His family bought the title.

856
01:34:53,890 --> 01:34:55,730
Their real name is Stoke.

857
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:04,220
It was fate that drove me to work

858
01:35:04,820 --> 01:35:08,850
for false relations as a way of
hoping my own folk to live.

859
01:35:11,980 --> 01:35:18,380
Alec, Alexander took advantage of me.

860
01:35:20,650 --> 01:35:23,320
Lioness strengh... my defeat.

861
01:35:27,090 --> 01:35:31,470
I became his mistress
and his affaire without love.

862
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:40,830
Like yours, my sad union
ended after a few weeks.

863
01:35:42,290 --> 01:35:49,630
We bore a child which died very young.

864
01:35:53,780 --> 01:35:56,250
My life was a ruins until the day I met you.

865
01:36:39,570 --> 01:36:40,360
I'm going out.

866
01:37:34,970 --> 01:37:37,470
If you don't forgive me......

867
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:42,230
but I forgive you, Angel.

868
01:37:42,450 --> 01:37:43,100
Yes, I know.

869
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:50,170
But you.... you don't forgive me?

870
01:37:51,220 --> 01:37:52,990
You were one person, now you are another.

871
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:56,750
I have mercy.

872
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:02,040
I have mercy.

873
01:38:02,980 --> 01:38:04,440
Angel, what do you mean by that laugh?

874
01:38:07,650 --> 01:38:09,140
How can you speak to me like this?

875
01:38:09,490 --> 01:38:12,270
It frightens me. How can you?

876
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:13,620
You are not the woman I loved.

877
01:38:15,550 --> 01:38:16,520
Well, who am I then?

878
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:18,630
Another woman in her shape.

879
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:26,640
It is not the woman I love... but

880
01:38:27,930 --> 01:38:29,840
another woman in her shape.

881
01:38:35,350 --> 01:38:36,970
Angel, Angel, please.

882
01:38:37,230 --> 01:38:39,060
I was a child, a child when it happened.

883
01:38:39,380 --> 01:38:40,770
I... I knew nothing of men.

884
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:42,820
You were sinned against. That I grant you.

885
01:38:45,610 --> 01:38:47,340
So you don't forgive me.

886
01:38:47,560 --> 01:38:50,300
I forgive you, but forgiveness isn't all.

887
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:53,650
You don't love me.

888
01:38:54,730 --> 01:38:56,190
I can not help associating your lack

889
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:58,200
of firmness with thedecline of your family.

890
01:38:59,220 --> 01:39:00,430
Decrepid families imply indeficient

891
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:02,450
will-power and indecadent conduct.

892
01:39:02,910 --> 01:39:04,890
I thought you were a child of nature.

893
01:39:05,590 --> 01:39:06,830
But you are the last in the line

894
01:39:07,010 --> 01:39:08,120
of degenerate aristocrats.

895
01:40:51,100 --> 01:40:52,900
Breakfast is ready.

896
01:41:35,850 --> 01:41:36,820
You can get rid of me.

897
01:41:39,820 --> 01:41:40,890
What did you say?

898
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:44,820
You can get rid of me.

899
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:48,540
You won't see me.

900
01:41:50,990 --> 01:41:51,400
Good god.

901
01:41:55,130 --> 01:41:56,660
How can you be so simple?

902
01:41:57,880 --> 01:42:02,530
You are too much of a child.
Too immature.

903
01:42:03,450 --> 01:42:04,730
Too ignorant I suppose.

904
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:17,080
Leave that!

905
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:19,420
You are my wife, not my servant.

906
01:42:24,810 --> 01:42:30,790
I am your wife but you
don't want to live with me.

907
01:42:33,370 --> 01:42:35,480
You are going to go, aren't you?

908
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:38,450
I couldn't stay without despising myself

909
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:42,450
which is worse than despising you.

910
01:42:45,030 --> 01:42:48,330
How can we live together
while that man exists?

911
01:42:49,100 --> 01:42:53,750
He is your natural husband. Not I.

912
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:07,060
Can you honestly tell me to stay?

913
01:43:09,530 --> 01:43:11,300
No.

914
01:43:23,730 --> 01:43:26,120
But it's absolutely necessary
that one of us remain here

915
01:43:27,730 --> 01:43:29,430
to avoid a scandal.

916
01:43:32,010 --> 01:43:34,370
We must at least keep up appearances.

917
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:37,740
Oh yes we must.

918
01:43:42,140 --> 01:43:43,350
What will you do?

919
01:43:47,430 --> 01:43:48,530
I can go home.

920
01:43:49,410 --> 01:43:50,380
You sure?

921
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:56,750
If you leave me, I shall go home.

922
01:43:58,630 --> 01:43:59,500
Certainly.

923
01:44:29,250 --> 01:44:30,810
Cross-in-hands, sir.

924
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:31,900
Yes I know.

925
01:44:32,390 --> 01:44:34,010
Come

926
01:44:46,450 --> 01:44:47,900
Now let's be clear about this.

927
01:44:48,570 --> 01:44:50,300
There's no anger in our hearts.

928
01:44:50,940 --> 01:44:52,320
Even though something
has happened between us

929
01:44:52,570 --> 01:44:53,820
which I cannot endure at present.

930
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:55,730
I shall let you know where I go

931
01:44:56,920 --> 01:44:58,470
and if I think i can
bare it, if I'm capable of it,

932
01:44:58,700 --> 01:45:00,910
I shall come to fetch you.

933
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:02,620
I shall wait.

934
01:45:03,570 --> 01:45:06,000
Until then, you'd do better
not to try and join me.

935
01:45:08,160 --> 01:45:10,940
Until then, I must not join you.

936
01:45:16,230 --> 01:45:18,590
May I write to you?

937
01:45:18,770 --> 01:45:21,410
Oh yes. If you are ill
or in need of anything.

938
01:46:01,370 --> 01:46:03,840
Ha… very good day to you Mr Clare.

939
01:46:04,360 --> 01:46:05,950
I've brought you some groceries.

940
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:08,980
There is some chicken,
come sausages and bacon.

941
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:09,950
Thank you, thank you so much.

942
01:46:10,170 --> 01:46:12,610
I've also brought you some butter,
some flour, a dozen eggs

943
01:46:12,850 --> 01:46:13,860
But that's far too much.

944
01:46:14,070 --> 01:46:15,870
Newly-weds are always hungry sir!

945
01:46:16,850 --> 01:46:19,700
From tonight onwards,
I shall cook for you myself.

946
01:46:19,990 --> 01:46:22,870
The truth is, you see, for sometime
I shall be needing less than

947
01:46:23,190 --> 01:46:26,340
that, because, infact,
I shall be alone for a day or two.

948
01:46:26,490 --> 01:46:28,470
My wife has been obliged
to rejoin her parents.

949
01:46:28,690 --> 01:46:31,120
Was there any illness in the family?

950
01:46:31,300 --> 01:46:33,510
No no nothing of that kind.
It was all arranged beforehand.

951
01:46:33,770 --> 01:46:35,750
So as far as all my meals
are concerned during Mrs. Clare's

952
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,360
absence, I'll talk of that later.

953
01:46:38,530 --> 01:46:40,370
Well shall... shall I leave the basket?

954
01:46:40,450 --> 01:46:42,070
Yes, indeed... the basket'll do for the day.

955
01:47:52,450 --> 01:47:54,600
I was passing on my way home sir.

956
01:47:55,300 --> 01:47:57,210
WE wanted to wish you well.

957
01:47:57,490 --> 01:47:59,190
You and Mrs. Clare.

958
01:47:59,410 --> 01:48:00,510
She's not here.

959
01:48:00,870 --> 01:48:02,530
I'm on the point of leaving
myself as you see.

960
01:48:03,580 --> 01:48:04,310
I'm leaving England.

961
01:48:04,590 --> 01:48:05,910
I've made up my mind to go to Brazil.

962
01:48:06,470 --> 01:48:10,960
Brazil? I am pleased.Tell Mrs Clare,

963
01:48:11,870 --> 01:48:13,460
I hope the journey agrees with her.

964
01:48:13,750 --> 01:48:14,680
She will not be leaving for the present.

965
01:48:14,890 --> 01:48:15,690
I'm going on ahead to get

966
01:48:15,900 --> 01:48:17,920
the measure of the place and
see what life there is like.

967
01:48:32,120 --> 01:48:33,360
How's Retty?

968
01:48:33,860 --> 01:48:35,390
Good. REtty's as strong as ever.

969
01:48:37,380 --> 01:48:37,990
And Marian?

970
01:48:39,010 --> 01:48:40,710
Marianne's taken to drinks sir.

971
01:48:41,100 --> 01:48:41,640
Really?

972
01:48:41,930 --> 01:48:44,120
Yes.Mr Crick's got rid of her.

973
01:48:45,240 --> 01:48:47,530
And you lzz. Are you well?

974
01:48:50,180 --> 01:48:52,680
With you gone sir, how could we be?

975
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:57,660
There... tis said.

976
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:00,620
Bye sir.

977
01:49:05,530 --> 01:49:06,210
Goodbye lzz.

978
01:49:26,340 --> 01:49:27,170
Izz!

979
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:50,520
If I was to ask you to
come with me now,

980
01:49:52,160 --> 01:49:53,260
Come to Brazil with me,

981
01:49:54,390 --> 01:49:55,420
would your answer be yes?

982
01:49:57,240 --> 01:50:00,500
To come with you I should
leave everything this minute.

983
01:50:00,890 --> 01:50:03,700
You know what it will mean
in the eyes of the society.

984
01:50:04,030 --> 01:50:05,310
I wouldn't care.

985
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:06,630
Do you love me so much?

986
01:50:07,890 --> 01:50:09,900
I've always loved you.

987
01:50:10,290 --> 01:50:11,840
More than Tess.

988
01:50:18,290 --> 01:50:22,220
No. Not more than her.

989
01:50:25,180 --> 01:50:27,160
Nobody could have
loved you more than Tess.

990
01:50:29,710 --> 01:50:31,290
She would have given her life for you.

991
01:50:33,220 --> 01:50:34,470
I could do no more.

992
01:53:28,750 --> 01:53:30,240
Oh... it's vanity.

993
01:54:14,670 --> 01:54:15,500
Good night my pretty.

994
01:54:15,540 --> 01:54:17,040
Good night sir.

995
01:54:18,340 --> 01:54:21,760
It is late for a maid to be roaming
around the mane by herself.

996
01:54:23,010 --> 01:54:25,310
Have you lost your way then?

997
01:54:27,390 --> 01:54:30,770
Step up here beside me and
I'll take you a part of the road.

998
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:36,400
for you scarce put one
foot in front of the other.

999
01:54:37,070 --> 01:54:39,240
Ride with me I say.

1000
01:54:43,710 --> 01:54:46,380
Ah? But I know you.

1001
01:54:48,260 --> 01:54:51,300
You are that Mr Stokes-
D'Uberville's fancy woman.

1002
01:54:52,090 --> 01:54:56,270
You weren't too proud
to cock-a-leg for Groby.

1003
01:54:59,940 --> 01:55:01,690
Trollop!

1004
01:55:19,130 --> 01:55:20,760
If it isn't my little Tess.

1005
01:55:28,100 --> 01:55:31,440
Oh poor poppet. What a state you are in.

1006
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:35,200
You are so cold!

1007
01:55:41,160 --> 01:55:44,210
Here. Get that inside you

1008
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:46,210
This will warm your bones

1009
01:55:49,010 --> 01:55:50,760
Go on my love. Drink it.

1010
01:56:01,190 --> 01:56:02,230
Get it out

1011
01:56:03,610 --> 01:56:05,570
You mustn't let yourself go.

1012
01:56:05,780 --> 01:56:07,780
Even bad luck runs out in the end.

1013
01:56:08,410 --> 01:56:09,700
Take my word for it.

1014
01:56:10,460 --> 01:56:11,710
I can't go on.

1015
01:56:12,250 --> 01:56:14,040
You'll feel better tomorrow.

1016
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:19,180
OH no. I can't go on. My life...

1017
01:56:22,470 --> 01:56:25,430
If I had the courage, I'd like to die.

1018
01:56:26,150 --> 01:56:28,440
Don't talk such flubbery.

1019
01:56:29,610 --> 01:56:31,690
Why didn't you come and see me sooner?

1020
01:56:33,030 --> 01:56:34,610
Eh? I could have taken you in here, my girl.

1021
01:56:35,070 --> 01:56:35,990
Is there still some work here.

1022
01:56:36,330 --> 01:56:38,160
In this wretched place?

1023
01:56:39,410 --> 01:56:42,370
There's always work here.

1024
01:56:52,770 --> 01:56:55,390
Come... have some
of my nice soup.

1025
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:05,530
After that, we must
take off those slum,

1026
01:57:06,080 --> 01:57:09,710
mirky clothes and
prettify yourself. Eh?

1027
01:57:17,090 --> 01:57:19,970
Just to make me jealous again, hey?

1028
01:57:22,810 --> 01:57:23,890
WEll, Tessy.

1029
01:58:46,590 --> 01:58:47,640
Are you the new hand?

1030
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:59,780
T'was you was it?

1031
01:59:03,030 --> 01:59:04,580
Is that all you've done?

1032
01:59:05,450 --> 01:59:07,000
T'is a mighty poor show.

1033
01:59:07,540 --> 01:59:09,080
She's not accustomed to it.

1034
01:59:09,250 --> 01:59:10,830
I don't keep useless hands here.

1035
01:59:11,380 --> 01:59:12,630
I'm not payed for what we do.

1036
01:59:12,920 --> 01:59:14,340
So where's the difference?

1037
01:59:14,510 --> 01:59:15,300
No arguing.

1038
01:59:15,510 --> 01:59:16,890
I want the whole lot cleared.

1039
01:59:17,510 --> 01:59:18,180
Well, it's too late.

1040
01:59:19,720 --> 01:59:20,890
You'd better.

1041
01:59:29,780 --> 01:59:31,280
Now, you not mind Groby.

1042
01:59:32,660 --> 01:59:33,740
T'is just as well.

1043
01:59:34,290 --> 01:59:35,790
Ah... I know lord loves us.

1044
01:59:36,370 --> 01:59:37,870
but it's not like it was at the dairy.

1045
01:59:38,580 --> 01:59:40,380
Dairyman on the deck all the week,

1046
01:59:41,300 --> 01:59:43,260
On Sundays he's the Mr Richard Crick!

1047
02:00:45,640 --> 02:00:47,680
It don't do to pray here missy.

1048
02:00:51,980 --> 02:00:53,730
There's been a curse on this place.

1049
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:57,950
This is the Cross-in-hand, isn't it?

1050
02:00:58,160 --> 02:00:59,320
Aye. So it is.

1051
02:01:00,990 --> 02:01:04,040
On the count of a malefactor
they tortured here, in ancient times

1052
02:01:04,290 --> 02:01:09,630
they did nail his hand onto the
post and then they hangged him.

1053
02:01:10,970 --> 02:01:14,800
The bones are down
there to this day I'm told.

1054
02:04:02,540 --> 02:04:03,540
OH!

1055
02:04:06,590 --> 02:04:07,460
What have you found?

1056
02:04:08,340 --> 02:04:10,140
An old pair of boots.

1057
02:04:16,440 --> 02:04:17,900
STill in good condition.

1058
02:04:21,940 --> 02:04:23,490
Could be of use to the poor.

1059
02:05:21,190 --> 02:05:22,900
There! Have a look.

1060
02:06:14,190 --> 02:06:16,440
I knew nothing of your circumstances.

1061
02:06:16,810 --> 02:06:19,820
Nothing at all until your mother wrote to me.

1062
02:06:20,030 --> 02:06:20,740
My mother?

1063
02:06:20,990 --> 02:06:24,160
She wrote what you should
have told me a long time ago.

1064
02:06:25,870 --> 02:06:26,950
I came at once.

1065
02:06:29,630 --> 02:06:30,500
Tess...

1066
02:06:39,560 --> 02:06:40,970
Why did you never say anything?

1067
02:06:41,430 --> 02:06:43,140
I had nothing to ask of you.

1068
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:45,400
That isn't so.

1069
02:06:47,110 --> 02:06:50,740
You wear your ridiculous pride like a h

1070
02:06:51,570 --> 02:06:54,120
And you put me even more
in the wrong than I was!

1071
02:06:55,080 --> 02:06:56,200
Against my will

1072
02:06:57,790 --> 02:06:59,960
I have done my duty for my child.

1073
02:07:01,290 --> 02:07:02,670
On my honour i did it.

1074
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:04,510
honour...

1075
02:07:06,510 --> 02:07:08,890
I want to take you away
from this wretched place.

1076
02:07:09,260 --> 02:07:10,350
Somewhere you're worthy of.

1077
02:07:11,560 --> 02:07:16,020
What is this strange temptation
that misery holds for you?

1078
02:07:16,940 --> 02:07:18,730
Come to your senses.

1079
02:07:19,570 --> 02:07:20,650
Come away with me.

1080
02:07:26,330 --> 02:07:27,290
your father's ill.

1081
02:07:27,420 --> 02:07:28,210
Did you know?

1082
02:07:29,210 --> 02:07:29,880
yes...

1083
02:07:30,750 --> 02:07:32,800
they fear the worst.

1084
02:07:33,420 --> 02:07:36,760
your family will be evicted if he dies.

1085
02:07:39,640 --> 02:07:41,810
I'm offering you my help sincerely.

1086
02:07:43,980 --> 02:07:45,270
Noone else seems to care.

1087
02:07:47,030 --> 02:07:49,700
Who is this husband of yours?

1088
02:07:50,870 --> 02:07:52,160
How can he abandon you like this?

1089
02:07:53,330 --> 02:07:55,290
Tess!

1090
02:10:24,540 --> 02:10:28,250
There's a point beyond
which obstinity becomes stupedity.

1091
02:10:32,010 --> 02:10:34,050
Are you in love with this drudgery?

1092
02:10:37,230 --> 02:10:38,940
I may be a sham-D'Urberville

1093
02:10:39,270 --> 02:10:41,190
but my little finger can
do more for you than

1094
02:10:41,480 --> 02:10:42,820
your blue-blooded ancestors.

1095
02:10:47,070 --> 02:10:50,740
I'm right. You know I am.

1096
02:10:56,670 --> 02:10:58,510
Forget about all this

1097
02:10:59,970 --> 02:11:00,840
and forget about that mule

1098
02:11:01,300 --> 02:11:02,590
that you call your husband.

1099
02:11:07,140 --> 02:11:10,900
Go on. Hit me. I shall not cry out.

1100
02:11:12,650 --> 02:11:14,650
Once beckon...
always beckon again.

1101
02:11:15,530 --> 02:11:16,360
That's law.

1102
02:11:17,160 --> 02:11:18,200
I was your master once

1103
02:11:21,040 --> 02:11:21,790
and so shall be again.

1104
02:11:24,330 --> 02:11:27,840
If you are any man's wife,
you are mine.

1105
02:11:30,010 --> 02:11:31,260
My own dear husband.

1106
02:11:32,680 --> 02:11:35,390
I shall die soon unless
I get a word from you.

1107
02:11:36,850 --> 02:11:39,150
All my letter have
remained unanswered.

1108
02:11:41,110 --> 02:11:43,530
Have you even received them?

1109
02:11:45,570 --> 02:11:49,910
I long for one thing only.
And that is to see you again.

1110
02:11:51,250 --> 02:11:52,410
Come back to me Angel.

1111
02:11:53,790 --> 02:11:57,090
Come back to me and save me
from the thing that threatens me.

1112
02:12:33,010 --> 02:12:37,100
Any reasonable person would
call this a ludicrous situation.

1113
02:12:38,770 --> 02:12:42,440
I offered to help you.
You wanned all of that.

1114
02:12:43,860 --> 02:12:47,450
You prefer to turnyourself into gypsies.

1115
02:12:48,240 --> 02:12:48,750
Please go.

1116
02:12:49,580 --> 02:12:52,710
In other words, Mrs. Clare,
you are asking me to let

1117
02:12:52,960 --> 02:12:53,960
you starve in peace.

1118
02:12:54,210 --> 02:12:55,250
Go away!

1119
02:12:57,010 --> 02:12:58,800
You'll be civil yet.

1120
02:13:06,940 --> 02:13:09,270
What's to become of me
and my poor little mites?

1121
02:13:10,610 --> 02:13:12,570
WE be the D'Urberville family.

1122
02:13:12,820 --> 02:13:13,950
It's written there isn't it?

1123
02:13:14,410 --> 02:13:17,120
Oh yeah... it's written there
fine enough. I grant you.

1124
02:13:17,620 --> 02:13:18,870
But the rooms have been taken.

1125
02:13:19,790 --> 02:13:21,120
You never sent in your deposits.

1126
02:13:22,500 --> 02:13:25,000
He means the money to
pay for the account, mother.

1127
02:13:25,840 --> 02:13:27,800
There's more to life than money sir!

1128
02:13:28,760 --> 02:13:31,810
You can not leave these poor,
fatherless children in the streets.

1129
02:13:32,270 --> 02:13:33,140
It would be a crime!

1130
02:13:33,390 --> 02:13:33,850
Missus...

1131
02:13:34,060 --> 02:13:36,440
Hospitality is sacred,
even among the Pagan Turks!

1132
02:13:36,810 --> 02:13:38,520
Please Missus... tis your own fault.

1133
02:13:38,900 --> 02:13:39,940
We'll see about that.

1134
02:13:40,570 --> 02:13:43,160
We are a true descendents
of the knightly D'Urbervilles.

1135
02:13:43,570 --> 02:13:45,950
Nobody leaves us in
the streets like raw apples.

1136
02:13:46,200 --> 02:13:49,540
Not in the home of our ancestors.
Our boards are in the

1137
02:13:49,750 --> 02:13:51,580
crip there laid out there in their carpets.

1138
02:13:51,790 --> 02:13:52,500
what's with you...

1139
02:13:52,920 --> 02:13:56,170
No, my dear. What's true is true.
Your poor father's eyes

1140
02:13:56,470 --> 02:13:58,090
are on us. We mustn't shame him.

1141
02:13:59,510 --> 02:14:02,970
Oh lord protect his own.
On the weekly champ he punished.

1142
02:14:03,690 --> 02:14:05,020
Ladies stopping here then?

1143
02:14:05,560 --> 02:14:07,230
no my good man. we are going on.

1144
02:14:08,030 --> 02:14:09,190
Good man... good man...

1145
02:14:09,690 --> 02:14:11,990
I ought to get by to Marlott.

1146
02:14:32,640 --> 02:14:33,520
Unload Darrell.

1147
02:14:33,980 --> 02:14:34,520
Where?

1148
02:14:34,810 --> 02:14:35,230
Here!

1149
02:14:35,560 --> 02:14:36,400
Here?

1150
02:14:36,650 --> 02:14:37,270
Yes Here.

1151
02:14:37,820 --> 02:14:39,610
We shall camp beside our church

1152
02:14:40,150 --> 02:14:41,530
until the town of our ancestors,

1153
02:14:41,780 --> 02:14:42,660
Find us our shelters.

1154
02:14:43,320 --> 02:14:45,370
Now come on children.
Set to work.

1155
02:16:32,100 --> 02:16:34,230
Why am I on the
wrong side of this door?

1156
02:17:49,550 --> 02:17:50,050
Yeah!

1157
02:17:50,510 --> 02:17:52,800
It's me Father, Angel!

1158
02:18:05,400 --> 02:18:08,200
My boy, my poor boy.

1159
02:18:08,530 --> 02:18:10,740
I've been ill but I'm alright now.

1160
02:18:28,730 --> 02:18:31,650
Why have you treated me
so monstrously Angel?

1161
02:18:32,730 --> 02:18:37,360
I do not deserve it.
I have thought it over carefully

1162
02:18:38,620 --> 02:18:40,990
and I can never, never forgive you.

1163
02:18:42,290 --> 02:18:46,460
You are cruel. I shall try to forget you.

1164
02:18:47,500 --> 02:18:51,760
All I ever received of
your hands is injustice.

1165
02:20:17,170 --> 02:20:18,670
Mr Durbeyfield.

1166
02:20:21,430 --> 02:20:23,060
Beg your pardon?

1167
02:20:23,720 --> 02:20:24,770
You are Mr Durbeyfield?

1168
02:20:26,390 --> 02:20:28,480
They don't live here no more.

1169
02:20:28,650 --> 02:20:29,730
Since when?

1170
02:20:30,900 --> 02:20:32,320
Since John Durbeyfield died.

1171
02:20:33,700 --> 02:20:35,070
Do you know where they went?

1172
02:20:49,260 --> 02:20:51,970
Durbeyfield... from 1832 to 1888

1173
02:20:52,890 --> 02:20:55,560
more properly D'Urberville of once

1174
02:20:55,890 --> 02:20:56,940
powerful family of that name

1175
02:20:58,020 --> 02:21:00,230
and directly descended
through illustrious lines

1176
02:21:00,480 --> 02:21:03,990
of Pagan D'Urberville.
Likes of a conqueror.

1177
02:21:04,490 --> 02:21:05,780
How are the mighty fallen?

1178
02:21:07,410 --> 02:21:09,200
Ah yes... how indeed.

1179
02:21:09,960 --> 02:21:12,000
May I? for the poor.

1180
02:21:14,210 --> 02:21:16,000
I prefer to settle
the Mason's account.

1181
02:21:17,220 --> 02:21:19,340
You'd think he's never
been paid for his work.

1182
02:21:21,930 --> 02:21:23,140
They were an odd family.

1183
02:21:23,770 --> 02:21:25,310
My collegue Mr Tringham,
would have done

1184
02:21:25,600 --> 02:21:26,890
better to have kept his mouth shut.

1185
02:22:03,620 --> 02:22:05,910
I should like to see Mrs Clare.

1186
02:22:09,210 --> 02:22:10,000
Tess

1187
02:22:11,380 --> 02:22:13,460
Yes I know. She's not here.

1188
02:22:15,170 --> 02:22:16,510
You are Mrs. Durbeyfield.

1189
02:22:17,840 --> 02:22:18,640
Yes

1190
02:22:19,800 --> 02:22:20,720
Where is she living?

1191
02:22:21,930 --> 02:22:22,680
I don't know.

1192
02:22:24,520 --> 02:22:25,480
I'm her husband.

1193
02:22:26,610 --> 02:22:27,980
I guessed as much.

1194
02:22:29,690 --> 02:22:30,860
Then tell me where she is.

1195
02:22:31,900 --> 02:22:32,910
Please, tell me.

1196
02:22:33,280 --> 02:22:36,580
Leave her. Leave her in peace.

1197
02:22:37,450 --> 02:22:39,710
My poor girl's suffered enough.

1198
02:22:41,130 --> 02:22:44,340
She don't care to see you sir. Never.

1199
02:23:00,610 --> 02:23:02,410
Mrs Durbeyfield,

1200
02:23:03,070 --> 02:23:05,330
take pity on a lonely,
wretched man.

1201
02:23:05,490 --> 02:23:07,000
Tell me where to find her.

1202
02:23:08,710 --> 02:23:09,500
I beg you.

1203
02:23:11,630 --> 02:23:12,590
She's at Sandbourne.

1204
02:23:12,800 --> 02:23:15,170
Sandbourne? But where?

1205
02:23:15,550 --> 02:23:17,090
It's a large town these days.

1206
02:23:17,430 --> 02:23:20,180
That's all I know. Sandbourne.

1207
02:23:49,810 --> 02:23:50,680
Excuse me.

1208
02:23:51,890 --> 02:23:53,520
I'm looking for a Mrs. Clare.

1209
02:23:54,150 --> 02:23:56,190
Would you by any
chance know her address?

1210
02:23:58,990 --> 02:24:02,580
Ah, George. You got a Clare around?

1211
02:24:05,290 --> 02:24:07,750
No... we've had a lot of
visitors here. You know.

1212
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:09,460
Or Durbeyfield. Miss Durbeyfield.

1213
02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:11,170
D'Urberville at the Herons.

1214
02:24:11,420 --> 02:24:12,090
That's it. D'Urberville.

1215
02:24:12,510 --> 02:24:14,760
It's a boarding house sir. Can't miss it.

1216
02:24:14,970 --> 02:24:15,590
Where abouts?

1217
02:25:12,800 --> 02:25:13,340
Yes?

1218
02:25:14,010 --> 02:25:15,720
Please excuse me
for calling at this hour.

1219
02:25:16,640 --> 02:25:19,480
But do you have a Teresa
D'Urberville staying in your board?

1220
02:25:19,980 --> 02:25:21,140
Mrs D'Urberville you mean?

1221
02:25:21,860 --> 02:25:22,560
Yes.

1222
02:25:23,770 --> 02:25:24,520
Please come in.

1223
02:25:30,410 --> 02:25:32,030
Would be kind enough to
tell her that her relative

1224
02:25:32,240 --> 02:25:33,120
is anxious to see her?

1225
02:25:33,450 --> 02:25:35,330
It's rather early sir. What name shall I give?

1226
02:25:35,670 --> 02:25:36,460
Angel.

1227
02:25:36,960 --> 02:25:37,670
Mr Angel?

1228
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,840
Angel. It's my christian name.
She'll understand.

1229
02:25:47,810 --> 02:25:50,310
I'll go and see if she's awake.

1230
02:26:53,440 --> 02:26:57,200
Tess. I came to ask your forgiveness.

1231
02:27:01,750 --> 02:27:02,750
It's too late.

1232
02:27:04,460 --> 02:27:07,590
Too late? My darling wife.

1233
02:27:09,050 --> 02:27:10,340
I've come to fetch you.
I'm going to...

1234
02:27:11,050 --> 02:27:13,720
Don't come near me Angel please.

1235
02:27:16,640 --> 02:27:19,600
Too Late. Too Late.

1236
02:27:21,150 --> 02:27:25,610
I'm not the man I was. I've suffered too.

1237
02:27:27,950 --> 02:27:29,660
I humbly beg you to forgive me.

1238
02:27:32,370 --> 02:27:39,050
Yes. yes... But I tell you it's too late.

1239
02:27:43,680 --> 02:27:46,140
Don't you know at all? Don't you?

1240
02:27:49,150 --> 02:27:51,110
How did you find your way here?

1241
02:27:53,740 --> 02:27:54,610
I saw your mother.

1242
02:27:59,490 --> 02:28:01,080
I waited and waited for you.

1243
02:28:02,080 --> 02:28:03,000
But you didn't come.

1244
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:06,920
I wrote to you. But you didn't come.

1245
02:28:11,390 --> 02:28:14,350
He has been good tome.
To all of us.

1246
02:28:19,060 --> 02:28:22,900
He's won me back to him.
He's upstairs.

1247
02:28:27,620 --> 02:28:30,450
Go now Angel. Go please.

1248
02:28:33,710 --> 02:28:35,750
Never come back anymore.

1249
02:30:05,590 --> 02:30:06,590
Good morning my dear

1250
02:30:21,990 --> 02:30:23,070
WEll, what's the matter now?

1251
02:30:28,120 --> 02:30:29,120
You feeling unwell?

1252
02:30:31,130 --> 02:30:32,340
Is that why you have the vapours?

1253
02:30:34,840 --> 02:30:38,930
Yes? No?

1254
02:30:42,390 --> 02:30:46,520
yes I know. You are moping as usual.

1255
02:30:50,900 --> 02:30:54,870
For god's sake, try and make an effort.

1256
02:31:02,550 --> 02:31:04,050
Did you have a bad dream?

1257
02:31:11,310 --> 02:31:12,890
Brazil perhaps?

1258
02:31:31,340 --> 02:31:34,300
These mooning hysterics
of yours are in poor taste.

1259
02:31:38,510 --> 02:31:40,470
Don't forget we are
lunching with the Bennets.

1260
02:31:41,520 --> 02:31:42,940
I'd like you to look presentable.

1261
02:31:46,110 --> 02:31:47,820
A genuine D'Urberville.

1262
02:33:59,170 --> 02:34:01,720
I came to tell you that I killed him.

1263
02:34:10,050 --> 02:34:11,220
I've done it.

1264
02:34:13,220 --> 02:34:14,270
I don't know how

1265
02:34:18,520 --> 02:34:19,520
I don't know.

1266
02:34:21,480 --> 02:34:23,820
I tried to rake him with my glove put

1267
02:34:25,490 --> 02:34:26,910
the blood in his mouth

1268
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:30,750
I thought I might be capable of it

1269
02:34:33,540 --> 02:34:38,720
Yes... yes. It was from that day on

1270
02:34:39,890 --> 02:34:40,680
What's mean?

1271
02:34:42,430 --> 02:34:43,810
I've killed him

1272
02:34:54,320 --> 02:34:55,610
I won't desert you.

1273
02:34:56,620 --> 02:34:59,200
I shall protect you by
every means in my power.

1274
02:35:00,500 --> 02:35:02,630
Whatever you may or may
not have done, I love you.

1275
02:35:03,210 --> 02:35:04,840
I love you.

1276
02:35:06,590 --> 02:35:07,680
Will they hang me?

1277
02:35:18,190 --> 02:35:21,030
WE must get out at the next
station and head north on foot.

1278
02:35:22,530 --> 02:35:24,370
They'll be looking for us at the Wessex ports.

1279
02:35:25,990 --> 02:35:27,910
Once we reach the north
we'll go abroad.

1280
02:36:21,610 --> 02:36:22,950
WE have makings of a mule here.

1281
02:36:23,700 --> 02:36:24,620
and a bottle of wine.

1282
02:39:26,040 --> 02:39:27,290
Rest at last.

1283
02:43:30,260 --> 02:43:32,220
We must leave at once.

1284
02:43:36,860 --> 02:43:41,280
WE must leave here as soon as possible.

1285
02:43:42,910 --> 02:43:46,490
My life couldn't be a matter of weeks?

1286
02:43:48,250 --> 02:43:49,460
Why not wait for them here?

1287
02:43:50,920 --> 02:43:52,920
Since they'll catch me in any case.

1288
02:43:54,130 --> 02:43:55,260
I'm going to save you.

1289
02:43:55,800 --> 02:43:56,550
Do you hear?

1290
02:43:57,130 --> 02:43:58,390
I'm going to save you.

1291
02:45:21,460 --> 02:45:22,710
Can't we rest here?

1292
02:45:23,880 --> 02:45:28,050
I'm afraid not. By day this place
is visible from miles around.

1293
02:45:31,230 --> 02:45:33,150
There are no stars tonight.

1294
02:45:38,450 --> 02:45:41,410
Perhaps we could have made
our souls take flight together.

1295
02:45:51,380 --> 02:45:53,210
Do they sacrifice to god here?

1296
02:45:54,510 --> 02:45:58,510
No . To the sun I believe. It's a Pagan temple.

1297
02:46:02,190 --> 02:46:03,480
Older than the ages.

1298
02:46:06,570 --> 02:46:07,980
Older than the D'Urbervilles.

1299
02:46:17,370 --> 02:46:19,880
Do you think we shall meet again after death?

1300
02:46:28,220 --> 02:46:30,680
I'm afraid Angel. I'm afraid.

1301
02:47:43,410 --> 02:47:44,830
There's no use sir.

1302
02:47:45,830 --> 02:47:47,420
The whole country's roused.

1303
02:48:03,610 --> 02:48:07,910
She's sleeping. Just a little longer.

1304
02:48:27,520 --> 02:48:29,020
Have they come for me?

1305
02:48:30,350 --> 02:48:31,940
Yes.

1306
02:48:47,050 --> 02:48:48,500
I'm ready.
