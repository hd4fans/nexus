Do you know why I continue to work
for that wretched queen year after year?

I do it because I know that one day
you are going to take back your kingdom,

182
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,403
and I want to be here
when that happens.

- Oh, but it is.

Your father meant
for you to inherit his crown.

And that woman has
the entire kingdom convinced

that you're a pathetic shut-in,
incapable of leaving the castle.

And the worst is,
she has you thinking it.

Your father's dagger.

189

00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,848
Why do you have
palace guard uniforms?

626
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,450
- We got them at work.
- What kind of job do you have?

627
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,721
We're... renegades.

628
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,609
- Rebels.
- Thieves!

629
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,603
That's true.
We stole the queen's gold!

630
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,120
You broke into the palace?

631
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,282
No, we nabbed it outside the village.

632
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,886
So you actually stole the people's gold.

633
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,081
(CHUCKLES)

634
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,481
- Not exactly.
- Yes, exactly!

635
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,841
That's the people's money!
Why, that's terrible. They need it.

636
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,241
- You must return it.
- We worked hard for that money.

637
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,640
Stealing isn't work.

638
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,450
- Sure it's work!
- It's hard!

639
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,369
I tore my shift, had to sew it.
That's work.

640
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:28,441
I'm sorry you got a few scrapes,
but the townspeople need that money.

641
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,887
They hate us.

642
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,806
- Well, that can't be true.
- It is. They despise us.

643
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:40,050
Years ago, when the queen
expelled all the "undesirables"...

644
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,809
...no one stood up for us.

645
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,123
She said...

646
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,331
"Banish all the Uglies."

647
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,564
You've been mistreated by the queen.

648
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,803
No one understands that better than me.

649
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,486
It's unfair, but so is stealing
from innocent families.

650
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,886
We weren't always thieves.

651
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,804
- We were legitimate.
- With real trades.

652
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,644
- I was a teacher.
- I was a butcher.

653
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,406
And I ran the pub.
A good, honest job.

654
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,520
- Honest?
- It was almost honest.

655
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,887
- I stole a little.
- A little?

656
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,008
- It's a cash business!
- That's your excuse?

657
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,645
Hey, everybody does it, all right?

658
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,961
- I didn't.
- Neither did I.

659
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,764
Uh, you put your thumb on the scale!

660
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,241
- I did not!
- Did too! And you cheat at poker!

661
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,209
- I win at poker.
- You cheat at poker?

has been returned!

673
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,250
It was brought back to us by...

674
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,488
Come up here, young lady,
and tell us your name.

- Those men there!
- Move!

SNOW WHITE: Those men...

679
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,244
They're the ones
that brought back the gold.

680
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,200
The queen told you that they
were undesirables, but she lied.

681

Huh?

682
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,962
These brave men are the true heroes.

683
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,885
They fearlessly raided
the queen's caravan and...

684
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,725
...and retrieved your gold.

685
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,688
They're the ones
that really deserve your thanks

all the way down there. (CHUCKLES)

You know, everyone has remarked
what a wonderful dancer you were last night.

693
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,522
Thank you, Your Highness.
I do have one question about the evening.

694
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:50,044
There was a girl there.
She had black hair and was very beautiful.

695
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,964
Beautiful?

696
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:55,124
Yes, I'd say she was
the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.

697
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,248
Ever is a very long time.

698
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,965
No, no, no, I know this in my heart.

699
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,361
I think she's the most beautiful
woman in the whole world.

700
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,443
Agree to disagree.
Let's leave it at that.

701
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,649
But do you know her?
Ivory skin, black hair...

702
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,610
Her hair is not black, it's raven,
and she's 18 years old,

703
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,808
and her skin has never seen the sun,
so of course it's good.

704
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,124
Meaning to say,
the girl you refer to is called Snow White.

705
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,285
Snow White.

706
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,607
I admit, she's very suited to the name.

707
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,529
Well... (CLEARS THROAT)

708

(WHISPERING) ...wasn't all there.

I'm sorry, Highness,
you're speaking about her in past tense?

712
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:38,921
Oh, I am.

713
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,883
How indelicate of me. She's dead.

714
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,684
- Dead?
- Mm.

715
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,728
- How?
- Last night, in the woods.

716
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,848
Oh. Treacherous place, the woods.

717
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,923
- This is terrible.
- Do you need a second?

718
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,690
Yes, thank you,
I just need to process.

719
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,328
Prince Alcott,
I have a proposition for you.

720
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,609
We're both single adults,
roughly the same age.

721
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,683
- I don't think we're the same...
- I said roughly.

722
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,442
The point is, the clock is
ticking for both of us.

723
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,443
We are people of means.

724
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,841
Would you do me the honor and be <i>my...</i>

Pardon my appearance, Your Majesty,
but there's been a development.

729
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,849
- The royal taxes have been stolen.
- Stolen? By whom?

730
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,321
- Bandits.
- Bandits.

731
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,528
Uh-huh, bandits.

732
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:39,409
- Very intimidating.
- I'm sorry. I can't take this any more.

No. You have to be a thief.

about my thoughts on stealing.

What if you were stealing
from the queen?

You said yourself she's wicked.

- Why not you?

Fine. But she doesn't know
the first thing about thieving!

We were ambushed.

You went to the woods

caught you by surprise?

She? The bandits' leader is a she?

Impossible, sir. Snow White is dead.

Perhaps it was just someone
who looked like Snow White.

00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:22,603
- It was definitely Snow White.
- You were in the forest, it was dark.

848
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:25,650
I think we should at least open
ourselves up to the possibility

849
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:29,009
that it was just someone who looked
a lot like the late Snow White.

- What a fun surprise.
- Agree to disagree.

00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,083
- I wish I was dead.
- You also told me she was mad.

853
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:40,289
She is mad.
Not as mad as I am, however.

854
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,885
So which is it, she's mad or she's dead?

855
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:45,209
She seemed completely sound of mind
when she and her band of dwarfs...

00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,886
"Dwarfs"?
You said they were giants.

Brighton said he fed her to the beast.

Brighton fell victim to her beauty,

I just want her dead!

I need to do something
about this prince.
