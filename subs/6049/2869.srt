1
00:00:30,195 --> 00:00:31,560
Happy New Year's, ladies.

2
00:00:31,629 --> 00:00:33,995
Gabby, it's New Year's Eve.
Enough reading.

3
00:00:34,065 --> 00:00:35,589
But, Mom, I'm almost done.

4
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:39,159
The teen party? I've laid out
your best clothes. Come get ready.

5
00:00:39,237 --> 00:00:41,762
Can I have my book back?

6
00:00:42,707 --> 00:00:45,369
- Thank you.
- Come on.

7
00:00:46,611 --> 00:00:48,044
Keep working left, Troy.

8
00:00:48,113 --> 00:00:50,479
Got a guard in the championship game
we're expectin'. You'll torch 'em!

9
00:00:50,548 --> 00:00:51,947
- Am I going left?
- Yeah.

10
00:00:52,017 --> 00:00:55,384
- He looks middle, you take it downtown.
- OK, like this?

11
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:00,524
Whoo! That's it, man. Sweet.
Let's see that in the game.

12
00:01:00,592 --> 00:01:02,685
- Boys?
- Don't worry about me.

13
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:05,821
Did we really fly all this way
to play more basketball?

14
00:01:07,665 --> 00:01:08,723
Yeah.

15
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,995
It's the last night of vacation.

16
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:12,866
The party, remember?

17
00:01:12,937 --> 00:01:15,997
Right, the party.
The party. New Year's Eve.

18
00:01:16,074 --> 00:01:19,407
Troy, they have a kid's party downstairs
in the Freestyle club.

19
00:01:19,477 --> 00:01:22,412
- Kid's party?
- Young adults. Now go, shower up.

20
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:25,040
Come on. One more.

21
00:01:25,116 --> 00:01:27,175
- Last one.
- Real quick.

22
00:01:29,287 --> 00:01:31,084
There we go.
That's the way to end it.

23
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:52,935
Howdy, ma'am.

24
00:01:58,783 --> 00:02:01,411
All right! How about that
for a couple of snowboarders?

25
00:02:03,154 --> 00:02:06,055
- Yeah!
- Hey!

26
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:08,750
Who's gonna rock the house next?

27
00:02:10,595 --> 00:02:12,358
Huh?

28
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:18,894
Ha-ha! Ho-ho!

29
00:02:22,474 --> 00:02:23,907
I can't sing. No, you go.

30
00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:27,274
And you! Yeah, come on.

31
00:02:29,147 --> 00:02:31,115
Look, I don't sing. I can't sing.
No, guys...

32
00:02:31,182 --> 00:02:33,013
Get up there!

33
00:02:33,084 --> 00:02:38,044
Hey, you know what? Someday you guys
might thank me for this.

34
00:02:38,123 --> 00:02:39,590
Or not.

35
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:53,797
Living in my own world

36
00:02:53,872 --> 00:02:56,602
Didn't understand

37
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:01,435
That anything can happen

38
00:03:03,414 --> 00:03:07,510
When you take a chance

39
00:03:07,585 --> 00:03:12,181
I never believed in

40
00:03:12,257 --> 00:03:15,954
What I couldn't see

41
00:03:16,027 --> 00:03:20,623
- I never opened my heart
- Oh

42
00:03:20,698 --> 00:03:24,930
To all the possibilities

43
00:03:25,003 --> 00:03:26,470
Ooh

44
00:03:26,538 --> 00:03:29,974
- I know
- That something has changed

45
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,032
Never felt this way

46
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,101
And right here tonight

47
00:03:34,179 --> 00:03:38,843
This could be the start
of something new

48
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:43,217
- It feels so right
- To be here with you

49
00:03:43,288 --> 00:03:44,619
Oh!

50
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:48,125
And now I'm lookin' in your eyes

51
00:03:48,193 --> 00:03:52,892
- I feel in my heart
- Feel in my heart

52
00:03:52,964 --> 00:03:55,797
The start of something new

53
00:03:55,867 --> 00:03:58,631
Oh, yeah

54
00:03:58,703 --> 00:04:02,833
Now who'd have ever thought that

55
00:04:03,608 --> 00:04:05,542
We'd both be here tonight

56
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,134
- Ooh
- Yeah

57
00:04:07,212 --> 00:04:11,615
- And the world looks so much brighter
- Brighter, brighter

58
00:04:11,683 --> 00:04:17,417
- Oh, with you by my side
- By my side

59
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:22,858
I know that something has changed,
never felt this way

60
00:04:22,927 --> 00:04:25,327
- I know it for real
- Real

61
00:04:25,396 --> 00:04:29,765
This could be the start
of something new

62
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:34,430
It feels so right to be here with you

63
00:04:34,505 --> 00:04:36,063
Oh!

64
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:43,239
And now looking in your eyes
I feel in my heart

65
00:04:43,314 --> 00:04:45,077
The start of something new

66
00:04:45,149 --> 00:04:51,110
I never knew that it could happen
till it happened to me

67
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:54,681
Oh, yeah

68
00:04:54,759 --> 00:05:00,789
I didn't know it before
but now it's easy to see

69
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:04,392
Oh!

70
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:09,099
It's the start of something new

71
00:05:09,173 --> 00:05:13,542
It feels so right to be here with you

72
00:05:13,611 --> 00:05:14,942
Oh!

73
00:05:15,013 --> 00:05:22,886
And now I'm lookin' in your eyes
I feel in my heart

74
00:05:22,954 --> 00:05:27,914
That it's the start of something new

75
00:05:27,992 --> 00:05:32,793
- It feels so right to be here with you
- Oh

76
00:05:32,864 --> 00:05:36,960
And now looking in your eyes

77
00:05:37,035 --> 00:05:40,994
- I feel in my heart
- Feel in my heart

78
00:05:41,072 --> 00:05:43,472
The start of something new

79
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,634
The start of something new

80
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:52,013
The start of something new

81
00:05:56,521 --> 00:05:59,513
- Troy.
- Gabriella.

82
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,795
But seriously, you have an amazing voice.
You're a singer, right?

83
00:06:05,863 --> 00:06:08,832
Just church choir is all.
I tried to solo and nearly fainted.

84
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,197
Really? Why is that?

85
00:06:10,268 --> 00:06:13,931
I looked at the people staring at me. Next
thing I knew, I was staring at the ceiling.

86
00:06:14,005 --> 00:06:17,497
- End of solo career.
- The way you sing, that's hard to believe.

87
00:06:17,575 --> 00:06:21,011
That was the first time I did that.
It was so cool.

88
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:24,412
- I know! Completely!
- You sound like you've sung a lot, too.

89
00:06:24,482 --> 00:06:27,645
Yeah, sure. My showerhead
is very impressed with me.

90
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:30,950
9, 8, 7...

91
00:06:31,022 --> 00:06:33,957
...6, 5, 4...

92
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:36,721
...3, 2, 1!

93
00:06:52,844 --> 00:06:55,870
I guess I better go find my mom
and wish her a happy new year.

94
00:06:55,947 --> 00:07:00,975
Yeah, me too. I mean, not your mom.
My mom... and dad.

95
00:07:01,586 --> 00:07:04,214
Uh... I'll call you.
I'll call you tomorrow.

96
00:07:04,288 --> 00:07:07,485
- Yeah!
- Here, put your number in.

97
00:07:09,927 --> 00:07:11,326
Here.

98
00:07:11,396 --> 00:07:13,330
- You too.
- Oh, OK.

99
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,500
There you go.

100
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:23,666
Just so you know, singing with you
was the most fun I've had on this vacation.

101
00:07:23,741 --> 00:07:26,972
So, um... where do you live?

102
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:39,880
Gabriella.

103
00:07:42,593 --> 00:07:46,654
Wildcats sing along
They really got it going on

104
00:07:46,731 --> 00:07:50,929
Wildcats in the house
Everybody sing out

105
00:07:51,002 --> 00:07:54,870
Wildcats. Everywhere
wave your hands up in the air

106
00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:57,430
That's the way we do it
let's get to it

107
00:07:57,508 --> 00:07:59,100
Time to show the world

108
00:07:59,177 --> 00:08:03,238
Wildcats. Sing along
They really got it goin' on

109
00:08:03,314 --> 00:08:07,876
Wildcats in the house
everybody sing out...

110
00:08:07,952 --> 00:08:10,443
- Troy! How ya doing, man?
- Hey, Chad, what's up?

111
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:12,716
- Hey, guys, happy new year.
- Yeah!

112
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:15,258
- It's a happy Wildcat new year!
- You're the man!

113
00:08:15,326 --> 00:08:17,453
In two weeks
we're going to the championships

114
00:08:17,528 --> 00:08:19,758
with you leading us
to infinity and beyond.

115
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:21,890
- What team?
- Wildcats!

116
00:08:21,966 --> 00:08:25,265
- What team?
- Wildcats!

117
00:08:28,172 --> 00:08:31,005
Ooh! Whoo-hoo!

118
00:08:34,545 --> 00:08:36,843
Ooh!

119
00:08:36,914 --> 00:08:38,882
The ice princess returned
from the North Pole.

120
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,850
She spent the holidays
the way she always does.

121
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:42,681
- How's that?
- Shopping for mirrors.

122
00:08:42,753 --> 00:08:44,277
Ooh!

123
00:08:45,857 --> 00:08:50,351
Ugh, behold the zoo animals
heralding the new year. How tribal.

124
00:08:54,265 --> 00:08:55,254
Mom, my stomach...

125
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:59,463
Is nervous on first day at a new school.
You'll do great. You always do.

126
00:08:59,537 --> 00:09:03,234
I made my company promise that I can't
be transferred again until you graduate.

127
00:09:03,307 --> 00:09:07,937
I reviewed your impressive transcripts.
Your light will shine brightly at East High.

128
00:09:08,012 --> 00:09:11,504
I don't want to be the school's
freaky genius girl again.

129
00:09:11,582 --> 00:09:14,176
Just be Gabriella.

130
00:09:14,252 --> 00:09:16,243
This way.

131
00:09:24,495 --> 00:09:26,963
Troy! Troy! Hey!

132
00:09:27,031 --> 00:09:29,795
How's it goin'? How are you?

133
00:09:30,234 --> 00:09:31,633
Miss Darbus?

134
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,429
- Do you remember the night before?
- No, not at all.

135
00:09:34,505 --> 00:09:37,497
All I remember is like, pink jelly. I...

136
00:09:37,575 --> 00:09:39,668
Excuse me.

137
00:09:39,977 --> 00:09:40,966
Ooh!

138
00:09:41,045 --> 00:09:42,910
- Hi, Troy.
- Hi.

139
00:09:44,048 --> 00:09:47,142
I trust you all had splendid holidays.

140
00:09:47,218 --> 00:09:51,814
Check the sign-up sheets in the lobby
for new activities, Mr. Bolton.

141
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:55,655
Especially our winter musicale.
We will have singles auditions...

142
00:09:55,726 --> 00:09:57,421
- You OK?
- Yeah.

143
00:09:57,495 --> 00:10:00,862
...and pairs auditions for our two leads.
- Pfft.

144
00:10:00,932 --> 00:10:05,892
Mr. Danforth, this is a place of learning,
not a hockey arena.

145
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:11,306
There is also a final sign-up for next week's
scholastic decathlon competition.

146
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:16,540
Chem Club president Taylor McHessey
can answer all of your questions about that.

147
00:10:18,783 --> 00:10:22,480
Ah, the cell phone menace
has returned to our crucible of learning.

148
00:10:22,553 --> 00:10:24,953
- Is it your phone?
- Sharpay and Ryan, cell phones.

149
00:10:25,022 --> 00:10:27,923
- I will see you in detention.
- Ahh!

150
00:10:27,992 --> 00:10:30,984
We have zero tolerance
for cell phones in class,

151
00:10:31,062 --> 00:10:34,122
so we will get to know each other
in detention. Cell phone.

152
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:40,433
And welcome to East High, Miss Montez.
Mr. Bolton, I see your phone is involved.

153
00:10:40,504 --> 00:10:45,168
- So we will see you in detention as well.
- That's not a possibility, Miss Darbus.

154
00:10:45,242 --> 00:10:48,769
Your Honor, see, 'cause we have
basketball practice, and Troy...

155
00:10:48,846 --> 00:10:52,282
Ah, that will be 15 minutes
for you too, Mr. Danforth. Count 'em.

156
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,875
Could be tough for Chad.
He can't count that high.

157
00:10:54,952 --> 00:10:57,352
Taylor McHessey, 15 minutes.

158
00:10:57,421 --> 00:11:00,948
Shall the carnage continue?
Holidays are over, people.

159
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:05,962
Way over!
Now, any more comments, questions?

160
00:11:06,831 --> 00:11:10,995
- Jason.
- How were your holidays, Miss Darbus?

161
00:11:11,068 --> 00:11:12,296
What?

162
00:11:20,244 --> 00:11:23,873
- Sorry, man. See you in detention.
- See you later. It's all good.

163
00:11:23,948 --> 00:11:25,779
Uhh, she's crazy.

164
00:11:27,151 --> 00:11:28,448
Hey!

165
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:29,952
- I don't...
- Believe it.

166
00:11:30,021 --> 00:11:32,251
- Well, me...
- Either. But how?

167
00:11:32,323 --> 00:11:35,656
My mom's company transferred her
here to Albuquerque.

168
00:11:35,726 --> 00:11:38,991
I can't believe you live here. I looked
for you at the lodge on New Year's Day.

169
00:11:39,063 --> 00:11:41,793
- We had to leave first thing.
- Why are you whispering?

170
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:45,893
What? Oh, uh... my friends
know about the snowboarding.

171
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,167
I haven't quite told them
about the singing thing.

172
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,502
- What's up?
- Hey.

173
00:11:50,574 --> 00:11:53,475
- Too much for them to handle?
- No, it was cool.

174
00:11:53,544 --> 00:11:57,480
But, you know, my friends, it's, uh...
It's not what I do.

175
00:11:57,548 --> 00:12:01,575
That was, like, a different person.

176
00:12:03,387 --> 00:12:07,983
So, uh... anyway, welcome to East High.

177
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:11,688
Now that you've met Miss Darbus,
I bet you just can't wait to sign up for that.

178
00:12:11,762 --> 00:12:15,892
I won't be signing up for anything for a
while. I just wanna get to know the school.

179
00:12:15,966 --> 00:12:18,662
But if you sign up,
I'd consider coming to the show.

180
00:12:18,736 --> 00:12:22,797
- Yeah, yeah. That's completely impossible.
- What's impossible, Troy?

181
00:12:22,873 --> 00:12:26,070
I wouldn't think "impossible"
is even in your vocabulary.

182
00:12:26,143 --> 00:12:29,874
Oh, so nice of you to
show our new classmate around.

183
00:12:38,189 --> 00:12:41,522
Oh, were you going to sign up too?
My brother and I

184
00:12:41,592 --> 00:12:45,323
have starred in all the school's productions
and we really welcome newcomers.

185
00:12:45,396 --> 00:12:49,457
There are a lot of supporting roles.
I'm sure we could find something for you.

186
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:52,661
No, no, no. I was just looking at
all the bulletin boards.

187
00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:55,069
Lots going on at this school. Wow.

188
00:12:57,475 --> 00:13:00,410
Nice penmanship.

189
00:13:02,246 --> 00:13:06,239
So, Troy. I missed you during vacation.
What'd you do?

190
00:13:06,317 --> 00:13:11,118
You know, um... played basketball,
snowboarding, more basketball.

191
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:13,452
- When's the big game?
- Two weeks.

192
00:13:14,258 --> 00:13:18,524
You are so dedicated.
Just like me.

193
00:13:18,596 --> 00:13:21,360
I hope you come watch me in the musical.
Promise?

194
00:13:23,768 --> 00:13:26,965
- Toodles!
- Toodles.

195
00:13:34,745 --> 00:13:39,808
Dude, you know that school musical thing?
You get extra credit just for auditioning?

196
00:13:39,884 --> 00:13:42,478
- Who cares?
- It's always good to get extra credit...

197
00:13:42,553 --> 00:13:44,111
...for college...

198
00:13:44,188 --> 00:13:47,646
Think LeBron James or Shaquille O'Neal
auditioned for their school musical?

199
00:13:47,725 --> 00:13:49,625
- Maybe.
- Troy.

200
00:13:49,693 --> 00:13:55,723
The music in those shows isn't hip-hop,
or rock, or anything essential to culture.

201
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:01,295
It's, like, show music.
It's all costumes and makeup...

202
00:14:01,372 --> 00:14:05,536
- Oh, dude, it's frightening.
- I know. I thought it'd be a good laugh.

203
00:14:05,609 --> 00:14:09,045
- Sharpay's kinda cute, too.
- So is a mountain lion.

204
00:14:09,113 --> 00:14:11,240
But you don't pet it.

205
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:16,447
All right, Wildcats! Pair up!

206
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,487
Let's go! Come on!

207
00:14:33,737 --> 00:14:36,501
Coach said to fake right and break left

208
00:14:36,574 --> 00:14:38,439
Watch out for the pick
and keep an eye on defense

209
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:40,500
Gotta run the give and go
and take the ball to the hole

210
00:14:40,578 --> 00:14:43,103
And don't be afraid
to shoot the outside "J"

211
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:47,139
Just keep your head in the game
Just keep your head in the game

212
00:14:47,218 --> 00:14:50,187
And don't be afraid
to shoot the outside "J"

213
00:14:50,254 --> 00:14:53,553
Just keep your head in the game
You gotta get your head in the game

214
00:14:53,624 --> 00:14:55,489
We gotta get our, get our, get our,
get our head in the game

215
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:57,652
You gotta get your,
get your head in the game

216
00:14:57,728 --> 00:14:59,719
We gotta get our, get our, get our,
get our head in the game

217
00:14:59,797 --> 00:15:01,856
Come on, get your,
get your head in the game

218
00:15:01,932 --> 00:15:04,025
We gotta get our, get our, get our,
get our head in the game

219
00:15:04,101 --> 00:15:06,126
You gotta get your,
get your head in the game

220
00:15:06,203 --> 00:15:08,364
We gotta get our, get our, get our,
get our head in the game

221
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:10,532
Whoo!

222
00:15:10,608 --> 00:15:12,906
Let's make sure
that we get the rebound

223
00:15:12,977 --> 00:15:15,104
'Cause when we get it
then the crowd'll go wild

224
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:16,908
A second chance, gotta grab it and go

225
00:15:16,981 --> 00:15:21,611
Maybe this time we'll hit the right notes

226
00:15:21,685 --> 00:15:25,587
Wait a minute, not the time and place
wait a minute, get my head in the game

227
00:15:25,656 --> 00:15:27,521
Wait a minute
get my head in the game

228
00:15:27,591 --> 00:15:31,584
Wait a minute, wait a minute
I gotta get my, get my head in the game

229
00:15:31,662 --> 00:15:33,823
You gotta get your, get your,
get your, get your head in the game

230
00:15:33,898 --> 00:15:35,923
I gotta get my, get my head in the game

231
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,934
You gotta get your, get your,
get your, get your head in the game

232
00:15:38,002 --> 00:15:40,061
Come on, get my,
get my head in the game

233
00:15:40,137 --> 00:15:42,332
You gotta get your, get your,
get your, get your head in the game

234
00:15:42,406 --> 00:15:44,374
I gotta get my,
get my head in the game

235
00:15:44,441 --> 00:15:47,239
You gotta get your, get your, get your,
get your head in the game, whoo

236
00:15:47,311 --> 00:15:51,247
Why am I feeling so wrong?

237
00:15:51,315 --> 00:15:54,580
My head's in the game
but my heart's in the song

238
00:15:54,652 --> 00:15:57,553
She makes this feel so right

239
00:15:57,621 --> 00:15:59,521
Should I go for it?

240
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:03,151
I better shake this. Yikes!

241
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:24,711
I gotta get my,
get my head in the game

242
00:16:24,782 --> 00:16:26,716
You gotta get your, get your,
get your, get your head in the game

243
00:16:26,784 --> 00:16:28,718
I gotta get my,
get my head in the game

244
00:16:28,786 --> 00:16:30,947
You gotta get your, get your,
get your, get your head in the game

245
00:16:31,021 --> 00:16:33,216
Come on, get my,
get my head in the game

246
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,485
You gotta get your, get your,
get your, get your head in the game

247
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:37,390
I gotta get my,
get my head in the game

248
00:16:37,461 --> 00:16:39,486
You gotta get your, get your,
get your, get your head in the game

249
00:16:39,563 --> 00:16:41,793
Whoo!

250
00:16:44,835 --> 00:16:46,359
- What team?
- Wildcats!

251
00:16:46,437 --> 00:16:47,563
- What team?
- Wildcats!

252
00:16:47,638 --> 00:16:49,003
- What team?
- Wildcats!

253
00:16:49,073 --> 00:16:51,473
- Wildcats!
- Get your head in the game!

254
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:07,683
So, it seemed like you knew Troy Bolton.

255
00:17:07,758 --> 00:17:09,885
Not really.
He was just showing me around.

256
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:14,624
Well, Troy usually doesn't
interact with new students.

257
00:17:14,698 --> 00:17:18,532
- Uh, why not?
- It's pretty much basketball 24/7 with him.

258
00:17:18,602 --> 00:17:22,163
- That should be 16 over pi...
- Yes, Miss Montez?

259
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:23,968
I'm sorry, I was just... Uh...

260
00:17:24,842 --> 00:17:27,777
Shouldn't the second equation
read 16 over pi?

261
00:17:27,845 --> 00:17:33,249
16 over pi? That's quite impossible.

262
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:37,385
I stand corrected.

263
00:17:40,524 --> 00:17:43,152
Oh... and welcome aboard.

264
00:18:02,312 --> 00:18:04,303
- Catch you later, guys.
- OK.

265
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,241
Troy Bolton was looking at our audition list.

266
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:10,809
Again?

267
00:18:11,922 --> 00:18:15,915
He was hanging around with that new girl
and they were both looking at the list.

268
00:18:15,993 --> 00:18:19,895
There's something freaky about her.
Where did she say she's from?

269
00:18:38,082 --> 00:18:40,573
Wow! An Einsteinette.

270
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:43,347
So why do you think she's interested
in our musical?

271
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:48,187
I'm not sure that she is. And we needn't
concern ourselves with amateurs.

272
00:18:48,258 --> 00:18:51,227
But... there is no harm in making certain

273
00:18:51,295 --> 00:18:54,731
that Gabriella's welcome to
school activities that are...

274
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:57,164
...well, appropriate for her.

275
00:18:57,468 --> 00:18:59,629
After all...

276
00:18:59,703 --> 00:19:01,728
...she loves pi.

277
00:19:09,213 --> 00:19:11,306
Gold! More gold!

278
00:19:16,086 --> 00:19:18,554
Paint, paint! Let's go!

279
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,060
- The answer is yes!
- Huh?

280
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:28,360
Our scholastic decathlon team
has its first competition next week,

281
00:19:28,432 --> 00:19:30,229
and there is certainly a spot for you.

282
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,167
- Where did those come from?
- Didn't you put them in my locker?

283
00:19:33,237 --> 00:19:37,173
- Of course not.
- Well, we'd love to have you on our team.

284
00:19:37,241 --> 00:19:39,641
We meet almost every day after school.

285
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,200
Please?

286
00:19:41,278 --> 00:19:45,112
I need to catch up on the curriculum here
before I think about joining any clubs.

287
00:19:45,182 --> 00:19:49,516
Well, what a perfect way to get caught up.
Meeting with the smartest kids in school.

288
00:19:49,586 --> 00:19:54,182
- What a generous offer, Taylor.
- So many new faces in detention today.

289
00:19:54,258 --> 00:19:55,885
I hope you don't make a habit of it,

290
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:59,395
but the drama club can always use
an extra hand.

291
00:19:59,463 --> 00:20:06,198
And while we are working, let us probe
the mounting evils of cell phones.

292
00:20:07,704 --> 00:20:12,903
Come on, guys, huddle up!
We got two weeks to the big game.

293
00:20:12,976 --> 00:20:15,171
Where's Troy and Chad?

294
00:20:17,681 --> 00:20:20,616
Don't make me ask again.

295
00:20:20,684 --> 00:20:23,847
- Where's Troy and Chad?!
- Detention.

296
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:35,457
Perhaps the most heinous example of
cell-phone abuse is ringing in the theater.

297
00:20:35,532 --> 00:20:39,525
What temerity!
The theater is a temple of art.

298
00:20:39,603 --> 00:20:45,769
- A precious cornucopia of creative energy.
- Where's my team, Darbus?

299
00:20:45,842 --> 00:20:47,810
What the heck are those two
doing in a tree?

300
00:20:47,878 --> 00:20:50,870
It's called crime and punishment, Bolton.

301
00:20:50,948 --> 00:20:55,476
Besides, proximity to the arts
is cleansing for the soul.

302
00:20:55,552 --> 00:20:57,543
Can we have a talk, please?

303
00:20:57,621 --> 00:20:59,851
And you two, in the gym, now!

304
00:21:07,731 --> 00:21:11,667
If they have to paint sets for detention,
they could do it tonight, not during practice.

305
00:21:11,735 --> 00:21:15,762
If these were theater performers,
would you seek special treatment?

306
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:19,331
Darbus, we are days away
from our biggest game of the year.

307
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:23,903
And we, Bolton, are in the midst of our
auditions for our winter musicale as well!

308
00:21:23,981 --> 00:21:28,247
This school is about more than
just young men in baggy shorts

309
00:21:28,318 --> 00:21:30,582
flinging balls for touchdowns!

310
00:21:30,654 --> 00:21:33,179
Baskets! They shoot baskets.

311
00:21:33,257 --> 00:21:36,818
Stop! Guys, listen,
you've been having this argument

312
00:21:36,893 --> 00:21:39,020
since the day you both started
teaching here.

313
00:21:39,096 --> 00:21:41,394
We are one school, one student body,

314
00:21:41,465 --> 00:21:44,434
one faculty!
Can we not agree on that?

315
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,534
So, Coach, how's the team lookin'?

316
00:21:48,605 --> 00:21:51,802
- Troy got 'em whipped into shape?
- Oh!

317
00:21:55,979 --> 00:21:59,107
West High Knights have knocked us out
of the playoffs three years running,

318
00:21:59,182 --> 00:22:03,414
and now we are one game away from
taking that championship back from 'em!

319
00:22:04,121 --> 00:22:07,022
It's time to make our stand.

320
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:09,422
The team is you.

321
00:22:09,493 --> 00:22:13,987
You are the team.
And this team does not exist

322
00:22:14,064 --> 00:22:20,003
unless each and every one of you
is fully focused on our goal. Am I clear?

323
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,731
- Hey, what team?!
- Wildcats!

324
00:22:21,805 --> 00:22:23,170
- What team?
- Wildcats!

325
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,571
- What team?
- Wildcats!

326
00:22:24,641 --> 00:22:26,632
- Wildcats!
- Get your head in the game!

327
00:22:27,811 --> 00:22:29,506
We've never made it past the first round

328
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:32,412
of the scholastic decathlon.
You could be our answered prayer.

329
00:22:32,482 --> 00:22:34,416
I'm focusing on my studies this semester,

330
00:22:34,484 --> 00:22:37,578
and help my mom get the new house
organized. Maybe next year.

331
00:22:37,654 --> 00:22:42,182
- What do you know about Troy Bolton?
- Troy? Hmm.

332
00:22:42,259 --> 00:22:44,853
I'm not an expert
on that particular sub-species,

333
00:22:44,928 --> 00:22:46,953
however, unless you speak cheerleader,

334
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:52,127
as in, "Oh, my gosh! Isn't Troy Bolton
just the hottie super-bum?"

335
00:22:52,202 --> 00:22:55,797
Oh, he's so beautiful.

336
00:22:55,872 --> 00:22:59,865
- Ha-ha. See what I mean?
- I don't know how to speak cheerleader.

337
00:22:59,943 --> 00:23:03,208
We exist in an alternate
universe to Troy the basketball boy.

338
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,679
Have you tried to get to know him?

339
00:23:04,748 --> 00:23:07,581
Watch how it works tomorrow
when you have lunch with us.

340
00:23:07,651 --> 00:23:11,178
Unless you'd rather sit with the
cheerleaders and discuss firm nail beds.

341
00:23:11,254 --> 00:23:13,484
My nail beds are history.

342
00:23:13,557 --> 00:23:16,253
Sister!

343
00:23:19,796 --> 00:23:22,560
- Still don't understand this detention thing.
- It was my fault.

344
00:23:22,632 --> 00:23:24,395
- Sorry, Dad.
- Cross court.

345
00:23:24,468 --> 00:23:29,633
Darbus will take any opportunity to
bust my chops. That includes yours too.

346
00:23:29,706 --> 00:23:31,196
Hey, Dad?

347
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:35,973
Did you ever want to try something new,
but were afraid of what your friends think?

348
00:23:36,046 --> 00:23:37,877
Like, going left? You're doing fine.

349
00:23:38,749 --> 00:23:40,944
Well... no.

350
00:23:41,017 --> 00:23:43,451
I mean, what if you wanna
try something really new

351
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,513
and it's a total disaster
and all your friends laugh at you.

352
00:23:47,591 --> 00:23:51,618
Maybe they're not your friends.
That was my whole point about team today.

353
00:23:51,695 --> 00:23:54,061
You gotta look out for each other.
You're the leader.

354
00:23:54,131 --> 00:23:56,599
There's gonna be college scouts
at our game next week.

355
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:59,032
Know what a scholarship
is worth these days?

356
00:23:59,102 --> 00:24:01,832
- A lot.
- Yeah. Focus, Troy, come on.

357
00:24:05,342 --> 00:24:06,502
Whoo.

358
00:24:17,087 --> 00:24:19,578
Just something for you.

359
00:24:25,796 --> 00:24:30,790
I expect we all learned our homeroom
manners yesterday, people, correct?

360
00:24:30,867 --> 00:24:34,268
If not, we have some dressing rooms
that need painting.

361
00:24:34,337 --> 00:24:37,568
Now, a few announcements.

362
00:24:37,641 --> 00:24:42,544
This morning during free period will be
your chance for the musicale auditions,

363
00:24:42,612 --> 00:24:45,080
both single and pairs.

364
00:24:45,148 --> 00:24:50,211
I will be in the theater until noon
for those of you bold enough to extend

365
00:24:50,287 --> 00:24:53,279
the wingspan of your creative spirit.

366
00:24:53,356 --> 00:24:55,722
When's she due back on the mother ship?

367
00:24:55,792 --> 00:24:58,090
Discussing the importance
of Shakespeare...

368
00:24:59,963 --> 00:25:01,294
- What's up, man?
- What's up?

369
00:25:01,364 --> 00:25:04,458
The team's hitting the gym during
free period. What should we run?

370
00:25:04,534 --> 00:25:07,935
I can't make it.
I gotta catch up on some homework.

371
00:25:08,004 --> 00:25:11,872
What? Hello, it's only the second day back.
I'm not even behind on homework yet.

372
00:25:11,942 --> 00:25:14,740
And I've been behind on homework
since preschool.

373
00:25:14,811 --> 00:25:17,871
That's hilarious.
I'll catch you later.

374
00:25:19,683 --> 00:25:22,049
Homework? There's no way.

375
00:25:26,556 --> 00:25:28,524
- How's it going?
- Just hanging out?

376
00:25:28,592 --> 00:25:31,618
- Good to see you.
- What's he doing?

377
00:25:33,263 --> 00:25:35,254
How's it going, man?

378
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,831
Short-cut.

379
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,776
I'm late for class.

380
00:26:39,095 --> 00:26:41,086
That's good, just leave it here.

381
00:27:04,254 --> 00:27:08,782
This is where the true expression
of the artist is realized.

382
00:27:08,858 --> 00:27:11,850
Where inner truth is revealed
through the actor's journey...

383
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:16,128
- Was that a cell phone?
- Is it mine?

384
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:18,793
- No, ma'am. That was the warning bell.
- Ah!

385
00:27:18,868 --> 00:27:22,395
Those wishing to audition must
understand that time is of the essence.

386
00:27:22,472 --> 00:27:26,704
We have many roles to cast
and final callbacks will be next week.

387
00:27:26,776 --> 00:27:30,303
First, you will sing a few bars and I will
give you a sense of whether or not

388
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:36,376
the theater is your calling. Better to hear it
from me now than from your friends later.

389
00:27:36,453 --> 00:27:39,183
Our composer, Kelsi Nielson,
will accompany you

390
00:27:39,255 --> 00:27:42,986
and be available for rehearsals
prior to callbacks.

391
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:44,083
Shall we?

392
00:27:45,128 --> 00:27:49,292
It's hard to believe that I couldn't see

393
00:27:49,366 --> 00:27:52,733
That you were always right beside me

394
00:27:52,802 --> 00:27:56,294
This feeling like no other

395
00:27:56,373 --> 00:28:00,070
I want you to know

396
00:28:00,744 --> 00:28:05,977
Uh-huh. Yes, thank you. Next!

397
00:28:06,049 --> 00:28:08,210
It's hard to believe

398
00:28:09,152 --> 00:28:13,521
That I couldn't sneeze... see

399
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:17,526
That you were always right there
next to... beside me

400
00:28:17,594 --> 00:28:20,620
Alan, I admire your pluck.

401
00:28:20,697 --> 00:28:23,131
- As to your singing...
...like no other

402
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:27,829
That's a wonderful tie
you're wearing. Next!

403
00:28:27,904 --> 00:28:32,807
It's hard to believe that I couldn't see

404
00:28:32,876 --> 00:28:36,334
That you were always there beside me

405
00:28:36,413 --> 00:28:40,349
This feeling's like no other

406
00:28:40,417 --> 00:28:42,612
I want you to know

407
00:28:42,686 --> 00:28:45,814
Uh... stop.

408
00:28:45,889 --> 00:28:50,849
...so lonely before I finally found

409
00:28:50,927 --> 00:28:53,725
What I've been looking...

410
00:28:53,797 --> 00:28:55,992
...for

411
00:29:00,704 --> 00:29:02,365
Ah... Cindra.

412
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:08,867
What courage to pursue a note that has
not been accessed in the natural world.

413
00:29:08,945 --> 00:29:11,937
Bravo! Brava!

414
00:29:12,015 --> 00:29:16,384
Perhaps the spring musicale.

415
00:29:35,705 --> 00:29:40,199
- It's hard to believe that I could not see
- Can't see

416
00:29:40,276 --> 00:29:43,040
- That you were right beside me
- Beside me

417
00:29:43,113 --> 00:29:45,911
- Thought I was alone
- Alone

418
00:29:45,982 --> 00:29:48,951
- With no one to hold
- To hold

419
00:29:49,018 --> 00:29:52,545
- But you were right beside me
- Beside me

420
00:29:54,858 --> 00:29:57,850
Well, that was just...

421
00:29:57,927 --> 00:30:02,864
...very disturbing.
Go see a counselor. Uhh.

422
00:30:02,932 --> 00:30:03,990
Next!

423
00:30:05,335 --> 00:30:07,360
Hey!

424
00:30:07,437 --> 00:30:09,769
So you decided to sign up for something?

425
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:13,741
- Uh... No. You?
- No.

426
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:18,577
Um... why are you hiding behind a mop?

427
00:30:18,648 --> 00:30:21,082
Your friends don't know you're here, right?

428
00:30:21,151 --> 00:30:23,984
Right.

429
00:30:28,158 --> 00:30:29,955
Thank you. Next.

430
00:30:31,861 --> 00:30:36,025
Miss Darbus is a little... harsh.

431
00:30:36,099 --> 00:30:41,298
- The Wildcat superstar's afraid?
- No! I'm not afraid, I...

432
00:30:41,371 --> 00:30:46,274
- I'm just... scared.
- Me too... usually.

433
00:30:46,342 --> 00:30:52,303
And for the lead roles of Minnie and Arnold
we only have one couple signed up.

434
00:30:52,382 --> 00:30:56,341
Sharpay and Ryan,
I think it might be useful for you

435
00:30:56,419 --> 00:31:01,618
to give us a sense of why
we gather in this hallowed hall.

436
00:31:08,331 --> 00:31:09,491
What key?

437
00:31:09,566 --> 00:31:12,831
Oh, we had our rehearsal pianist
do an arrangement.

438
00:31:12,902 --> 00:31:14,631
Oh.

439
00:31:22,412 --> 00:31:24,039
Go!

440
00:31:32,488 --> 00:31:36,015
It's hard to believe that I couldn't see

441
00:31:36,092 --> 00:31:39,118
You were always there beside me

442
00:31:39,195 --> 00:31:42,824
Thought I was alone with no one to hold

443
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:45,697
But you were always right beside me

444
00:31:45,768 --> 00:31:52,435
- This feeling's like no other
- I want you to know

445
00:31:52,508 --> 00:31:56,808
I've never had someone
that knows me like you do

446
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,144
The way you do

447
00:31:59,215 --> 00:32:03,652
I've never had someone
as good for me as you

448
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,086
No one like you

449
00:32:06,155 --> 00:32:11,115
So lonely before I finally found

450
00:32:11,194 --> 00:32:14,755
What I've been looking for

451
00:32:19,969 --> 00:32:24,633
So good to be seen,
so good to be heard

452
00:32:24,707 --> 00:32:27,073
Don't have to say a word

453
00:32:27,143 --> 00:32:31,375
For so long I was lost,
so good to be found

454
00:32:31,447 --> 00:32:35,406
I'm lovin' having you around

455
00:32:35,485 --> 00:32:39,080
This feeling's like no other

456
00:32:39,155 --> 00:32:42,215
I want you to know

457
00:32:42,292 --> 00:32:46,626
I've never had someone
that knows me like you do

458
00:32:46,696 --> 00:32:48,891
The way you do

459
00:32:48,965 --> 00:32:53,595
I've never had someone
as good for me as you

460
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,433
No one like you

461
00:32:56,239 --> 00:33:00,539
So lonely before I finally found

462
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:03,636
What I've been looking for

463
00:33:03,713 --> 00:33:04,805
Do-do-do

464
00:33:04,881 --> 00:33:07,816
Do do-do-do do-do

465
00:33:07,884 --> 00:33:09,943
Oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh

466
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:11,316
Do-do-do-do

467
00:33:11,387 --> 00:33:14,220
Do do-do-do do-do

468
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:17,316
Oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh

469
00:33:23,232 --> 00:33:25,097
I told you not to do the jazz squares.

470
00:33:25,168 --> 00:33:28,262
It's a crowd favorite.
Everybody loves a good jazz square.

471
00:33:32,742 --> 00:33:33,800
Well...

472
00:33:33,876 --> 00:33:37,073
Are there any last-minute sign-ups?

473
00:33:37,146 --> 00:33:41,845
Don't be discouraged. The theater club
needs more than singers. It needs fans too.

474
00:33:41,918 --> 00:33:43,977
Buy tickets!

475
00:33:44,053 --> 00:33:45,748
Oh, actually,

476
00:33:45,822 --> 00:33:49,758
if you do the part with that particular
song, I imagined it much slow...

477
00:33:49,826 --> 00:33:52,852
If we do the part?

478
00:33:52,929 --> 00:33:59,858
Kelsi, my sawed-off Sondheim,
I've been in 17 school productions.

479
00:33:59,936 --> 00:34:02,302
How many of your
compositions have been selected?

480
00:34:02,372 --> 00:34:06,206
- This would be the first.
- Which tells us what?

481
00:34:06,275 --> 00:34:10,439
- That I need to write you more solos?
- No. It tells us that you do not offer

482
00:34:10,513 --> 00:34:13,778
direction, suggestion or commentary.
And you should be thankful

483
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:16,717
that me and Ryan can lift
your music out of its obscurity.

484
00:34:16,786 --> 00:34:19,016
- Are we clear?
- Yes, ma'am. I mean, Sharpay.

485
00:34:21,557 --> 00:34:23,991
Nice talking to you.

486
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,119
Any last-minute sign-ups?

487
00:34:27,363 --> 00:34:31,595
- We should go.
- No? Good. Done.

488
00:34:36,539 --> 00:34:38,097
I'd like to audition, Miss Darbus.

489
00:34:38,174 --> 00:34:41,610
Timeliness means something in the world
of theater, young lady.

490
00:34:41,677 --> 00:34:47,013
The individual auditions are long over
and there are simply no other pairs.

491
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:48,744
I'll sing with her.

492
00:34:52,121 --> 00:34:57,991
Troy Bolton? Where is your sports posse
or whatever it's called?

493
00:34:58,061 --> 00:35:00,552
- Team.
- Ah.

494
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:04,088
But I'm here alone.
Actually, I'm here to sing with her.

495
00:35:04,167 --> 00:35:09,503
Yes, well, we take these shows very
seriously here at East High.

496
00:35:09,572 --> 00:35:12,564
I called for the pairs audition,
and you didn't respond.

497
00:35:12,642 --> 00:35:14,906
Free period is now over.

498
00:35:14,977 --> 00:35:20,973
- She has an amazing voice.
- Perhaps the next musicale.

499
00:35:34,864 --> 00:35:37,355
So, you're a composer?

500
00:35:37,433 --> 00:35:40,698
You wrote the song
Ryan and Sharpay just sang?

501
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:43,102
And the entire show?

502
00:35:43,172 --> 00:35:44,696
Well, that's really cool.

503
00:35:44,774 --> 00:35:48,574
I can't wait to hear the rest of the show.

504
00:35:49,846 --> 00:35:52,747
So, why are you so afraid of
Ryan and Sharpay?

505
00:35:52,815 --> 00:35:54,942
- I mean, it is your show.
- It is?

506
00:35:55,017 --> 00:35:58,714
Isn't the composer of a show kind of
like the playmaker in basketball?

507
00:35:58,788 --> 00:36:00,346
Playmaker?

508
00:36:00,423 --> 00:36:02,618
The one who makes everyone else
look good.

509
00:36:02,692 --> 00:36:06,059
Without you there is no show.
You're the playmaker here, Kelsi.

510
00:36:06,129 --> 00:36:08,097
I am?

511
00:36:08,164 --> 00:36:11,224
Do you wanna hear how the duet's
supposed to sound?

512
00:36:27,116 --> 00:36:31,985
It's hard to believe that I couldn't see

513
00:36:32,054 --> 00:36:35,683
You were always there beside me

514
00:36:35,758 --> 00:36:41,094
Thought I was alone with no one to hold

515
00:36:41,164 --> 00:36:44,292
But you were always right beside me

516
00:36:44,367 --> 00:36:48,804
This feeling's like no other

517
00:36:48,871 --> 00:36:52,204
I want you to know

518
00:36:52,275 --> 00:36:58,180
That I've never had someone
that knows me like you do

519
00:36:58,247 --> 00:37:00,807
The way you do

520
00:37:00,883 --> 00:37:06,822
And I've never had someone
as good for me as you

521
00:37:06,889 --> 00:37:10,256
No one like you

522
00:37:10,326 --> 00:37:15,923
So lonely before I finally found

523
00:37:15,998 --> 00:37:20,697
What I've been looking for

524
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:26,672
Ooh-ooh-ooh

525
00:37:32,982 --> 00:37:35,678
Wow. That's nice.

526
00:37:35,751 --> 00:37:38,049
Bolton, Montez - you have a callback.

527
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,647
Kelsi, give them the duet
from the second act.

528
00:37:41,724 --> 00:37:43,817
- Work on it with them.
- All right.

529
00:37:43,893 --> 00:37:47,829
If you guys wanna rehearse, I'm usually
here during free period and after school,

530
00:37:47,897 --> 00:37:52,061
and even sometimes during biology class.
You can come and rehearse anytime.

531
00:37:52,134 --> 00:37:55,865
Or come to my house for breakfast.
I have a piano, we can rehearse there.

532
00:37:55,938 --> 00:37:59,135
After school, before school - whatever
works. After basketball class...

533
00:38:00,176 --> 00:38:01,165
What?

534
00:38:01,244 --> 00:38:05,271
Callback?! Aah!

535
00:38:07,049 --> 00:38:10,541
"Callback for roles Arnold and Minnie
next Thursday, 3:30pm.

536
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,581
Ryan and Sharpay Evans,
Gabriella Montez and Troy Bolton."

537
00:38:15,658 --> 00:38:18,627
Is this some kind of joke?
They didn't even audition!

538
00:38:18,694 --> 00:38:20,525
- Maybe we're being punked?
- What?

539
00:38:20,596 --> 00:38:24,054
Maybe we're being filmed right now.
Maybe we'll get to meet Ashton!

540
00:38:24,133 --> 00:38:26,260
Oh, shut up, Ryan!

541
00:38:26,335 --> 00:38:29,304
What's wrong?

542
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,908
What?

543
00:38:36,445 --> 00:38:38,003
Uhh!

544
00:38:42,685 --> 00:38:45,882
How dare she sign up! I picked out
the colors for my dressing room.

545
00:38:45,955 --> 00:38:48,981
She hasn't even asked our permission
to join the drama club.

546
00:38:50,192 --> 00:38:53,184
- Someone's gotta tell her the rules.
- Exactly.

547
00:38:54,397 --> 00:38:57,389
- And what are the rules?
- Ohh!

548
00:39:11,681 --> 00:39:17,278
You can bet there's nothin' but net
when I am in a zone and on a roll

549
00:39:17,353 --> 00:39:20,049
But I got a confession,
my own secret obsession

550
00:39:20,122 --> 00:39:23,421
And it's making me lose control

551
00:39:23,492 --> 00:39:27,258
Everybody gather 'round

552
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:29,628
If Troy can tell his secret,
then I can tell mine.

553
00:39:29,699 --> 00:39:31,758
- I bake.
- What?

554
00:39:31,834 --> 00:39:35,133
I love to bake! Strudels, scones,
even apple pandowdy.

555
00:39:35,204 --> 00:39:37,195
Not another sound

556
00:39:37,273 --> 00:39:40,333
Someday I hope to make
the perfect creme brulee.

557
00:39:40,409 --> 00:39:44,368
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no

558
00:39:44,447 --> 00:39:47,007
Stick to the stuff you know

559
00:39:47,083 --> 00:39:50,314
If you wanna be cool
follow one simple rule

560
00:39:50,386 --> 00:39:53,480
Don't mess with the flow
no, no

561
00:39:53,556 --> 00:39:56,684
Stick to the status quo

562
00:39:56,759 --> 00:40:01,958
Look at me and what do you see?
Intelligence beyond compare

563
00:40:02,031 --> 00:40:05,159
But inside I am stirring,
something strange is occurring

564
00:40:05,234 --> 00:40:07,896
It's a secret I need to share

565
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:11,929
Open up, dig way down deep

566
00:40:12,007 --> 00:40:17,468
Hip-hop is my passion.
I love to pop and lock and jam and break!

567
00:40:17,546 --> 00:40:18,740
Is that even legal?

568
00:40:18,814 --> 00:40:20,679
Not another peep!

569
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:23,514
It's just dancing.
I think it's cooler than homework.

570
00:40:23,586 --> 00:40:27,989
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no

571
00:40:28,057 --> 00:40:30,855
Stick to the stuff you know

572
00:40:30,926 --> 00:40:33,690
It is better by far
to keep things as they are

573
00:40:33,763 --> 00:40:36,755
Don't mess with the flow,
no, no

574
00:40:36,832 --> 00:40:40,268
Stick to the status quo

575
00:40:40,336 --> 00:40:45,239
Listen well, I'm ready to tell
about a need that I cannot deny

576
00:40:45,307 --> 00:40:48,572
Dude, there's no explanation
for this awesome sensation

577
00:40:48,644 --> 00:40:51,909
But I'm ready to let it fly

578
00:40:51,981 --> 00:40:54,916
Speak your mind and you'll be heard

579
00:40:54,984 --> 00:40:57,350
If Troy wants to be a singer,
then I'm coming clean.

580
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:00,856
- I play the cello!
- Awesome! What is it?

581
00:41:01,323 --> 00:41:04,349
- A saw!
- No, dude, it's like, a giant violin!

582
00:41:04,427 --> 00:41:06,190
Not another word

583
00:41:06,262 --> 00:41:09,095
- Do you have to wear a costume?
- Coat and tie.

584
00:41:09,165 --> 00:41:12,965
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no

585
00:41:13,035 --> 00:41:15,697
Stick to the stuff you know

586
00:41:15,771 --> 00:41:18,706
If you wanna be cool,
follow one simple rule

587
00:41:18,774 --> 00:41:22,073
Don't mess with the flow,
no, no

588
00:41:22,144 --> 00:41:25,136
Stick to the status quo

589
00:41:25,214 --> 00:41:27,307
No, no, no

590
00:41:27,383 --> 00:41:30,819
Stick to the stuff you know

591
00:41:30,886 --> 00:41:33,446
It is better by far
to keep things as they are

592
00:41:33,522 --> 00:41:36,821
Don't mess with the flow,
no, no

593
00:41:36,892 --> 00:41:39,656
Stick to the status quo

594
00:42:03,886 --> 00:42:06,753
This is not what I want

595
00:42:06,822 --> 00:42:09,791
This is not what I planned

596
00:42:09,859 --> 00:42:12,726
And I just gotta say

597
00:42:12,795 --> 00:42:16,026
I do not understand

598
00:42:16,098 --> 00:42:19,261
Something is really

599
00:42:19,335 --> 00:42:24,637
- Something's not right
- Really wrong

600
00:42:24,707 --> 00:42:30,976
And we've gotta get things back
where they belong

601
00:42:31,046 --> 00:42:32,308
- We can do it
- Gotta play

602
00:42:32,381 --> 00:42:34,713
- Stick with what you know
- We can do it

603
00:42:34,783 --> 00:42:36,910
- Hip-hop hooray
- She has got to go

604
00:42:36,986 --> 00:42:38,419
- We can do it
- Creme Brulee

605
00:42:38,487 --> 00:42:40,250
Keep your voice down low

606
00:42:40,322 --> 00:42:41,721
- Not another peep
- No

607
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:43,382
- Not another word
- No

608
00:42:43,459 --> 00:42:44,653
- Not another sound
- No

609
00:42:44,727 --> 00:42:48,527
Everybody quiet!

610
00:42:49,398 --> 00:42:51,161
Why is everybody staring at you?

611
00:42:51,233 --> 00:42:53,827
- Not me, you.
- Because of the callbacks?

612
00:42:53,903 --> 00:42:56,133
I can't have people staring at me.
I can't.

613
00:42:56,205 --> 00:42:58,332
No! No, no, no

614
00:42:58,407 --> 00:43:01,808
Stick to the stuff you know

615
00:43:01,877 --> 00:43:04,437
If you want to be cool,
follow one simple rule

616
00:43:04,513 --> 00:43:08,005
Don't mess with the flow,
no, no

617
00:43:08,083 --> 00:43:11,018
Stick to the status quo

618
00:43:11,086 --> 00:43:13,884
No, no, no

619
00:43:13,956 --> 00:43:16,481
Stick to the stuff you know

620
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:19,494
It is better by far
to keep things as they are

621
00:43:19,562 --> 00:43:22,588
Don't mess with the flow,
no, no

622
00:43:22,665 --> 00:43:25,896
Stick to the status
stick to the status

623
00:43:25,968 --> 00:43:28,436
Stick to the status quo

624
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,308
Aah!

625
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:37,101
I am so sorry.

626
00:43:39,114 --> 00:43:40,809
You do not want to get into that, man.

627
00:43:40,883 --> 00:43:42,544
- Too much drama.
- Yeah.

628
00:43:42,618 --> 00:43:45,086
What is going on here?

629
00:43:45,154 --> 00:43:48,453
Look at this! That Gabriella girl
just dumped her lunch on me!

630
00:43:48,524 --> 00:43:51,960
On purpose! It's all part of their plan
to ruin our musical.

631
00:43:52,027 --> 00:43:55,519
And Troy and his basketball robots
are obviously behind it.

632
00:43:55,598 --> 00:43:57,361
Why do you think he auditioned?

633
00:43:57,433 --> 00:44:01,392
After all the hard work you've
put into this show.

634
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:03,836
It just doesn't seem right.

635
00:44:07,276 --> 00:44:11,007
- What's up?
- What's up? Oh, let's see...

636
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:14,379
You missed free-period workout
to audition for a heinous musical.

637
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:16,918
And now suddenly people are confessing.

638
00:44:17,553 --> 00:44:21,455
Yeah, and Zeke.
Zeke is baking... creme brulee.

639
00:44:21,523 --> 00:44:22,512
What's that?

640
00:44:22,591 --> 00:44:24,957
Oh, a creamy custard
with a caramelized surface.

641
00:44:25,027 --> 00:44:28,793
- It's really satisfying.
- Shut up, Zeke!

642
00:44:28,864 --> 00:44:32,300
Look... do you see
what's happening here, man?

643
00:44:32,368 --> 00:44:35,428
Our team is coming apart
because of your singing thing.

644
00:44:35,504 --> 00:44:39,133
Even the drama geeks and
the brainiacs suddenly think that they can...

645
00:44:39,208 --> 00:44:40,266
...talk to us.

646
00:44:40,342 --> 00:44:43,072
- Look, the skater dudes are mingling.
- Yo!

647
00:44:43,145 --> 00:44:45,875
Suddenly people think that they
can do other stuff.

648
00:44:45,948 --> 00:44:48,314
Stuff that's not their stuff.

649
00:44:48,384 --> 00:44:54,619
You're thinking about show tunes,
when we've got a playoff game next week.

650
00:45:02,498 --> 00:45:03,487
Whoa!

651
00:45:03,565 --> 00:45:05,032
Whoa!

652
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,762
- Ooh!
- Heads up!

653
00:45:19,715 --> 00:45:24,015
- All right. Cards on the table right now.
- Huh?

654
00:45:24,086 --> 00:45:28,022
You're tweaked because I put your stars
in detention and now you're getting even.

655
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:29,785
What are you talking about, Darbus?

656
00:45:29,858 --> 00:45:32,486
Your all-star son
turned up at my audition.

657
00:45:32,561 --> 00:45:35,325
Now, I give every student an even chance,

658
00:45:35,397 --> 00:45:38,628
which is a long and honorable
tradition in the theater.

659
00:45:38,701 --> 00:45:41,363
Something that you wouldn't understand.

660
00:45:41,437 --> 00:45:46,966
But, if he is planning some sort of practical
joke in my chapel of the arts...

661
00:45:47,042 --> 00:45:50,534
- Troy doesn't even sing.
- Oh, well, you're wrong about that.

662
00:45:50,612 --> 00:45:56,482
But I will not allow my Twinkle Town
musicale to be made into farce.

663
00:45:56,552 --> 00:46:00,682
- Twinkle Town?
- See? I knew it!

664
00:46:00,756 --> 00:46:04,317
- Hey...
- I knew it!

665
00:46:04,393 --> 00:46:07,521
Sounds like a winner.
Good luck on Broadway!

666
00:46:09,965 --> 00:46:13,059
Is Sharpay really, really mad at me?
I said I was sorry.

667
00:46:13,135 --> 00:46:16,696
Look, no one has beaten out Sharpay for
a musical since kindergarten.

668
00:46:16,772 --> 00:46:18,763
I wasn't trying to beat anyone out.

669
00:46:18,841 --> 00:46:21,173
We didn't even audition,
we were just singing.

670
00:46:21,243 --> 00:46:23,438
You won't convince Sharpay of that.

671
00:46:23,512 --> 00:46:27,778
If that girl could play both Romeo and
Juliet, her own brother would be aced out.

672
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:32,253
I told you it just happened, but I liked it.

673
00:46:32,321 --> 00:46:34,221
A lot.

674
00:46:34,289 --> 00:46:37,281
Did you ever feel like there's
a whole other person inside you

675
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:40,954
just looking for a way to come out?

676
00:46:41,029 --> 00:46:44,521
Not really. No.

677
00:46:47,035 --> 00:46:48,468
Let's go.

678
00:46:50,773 --> 00:46:54,174
Hey, Sharpay, I thought since Troy Bolton's
gonna be in your show...

679
00:46:54,243 --> 00:46:56,643
Troy Bolton is not in my show.

680
00:46:56,712 --> 00:47:00,773
OK, um... well, I thought maybe
you could watch me play ball sometime.

681
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:06,751
- I'd rather stick pins in my eyes.
- Wouldn't that be awfully uncomfortable?

682
00:47:06,822 --> 00:47:08,585
Evaporate, tall person!

683
00:47:10,592 --> 00:47:12,651
I bake!

684
00:47:12,728 --> 00:47:15,561
If that helps.

685
00:47:38,587 --> 00:47:44,753
- Wow! It's like a jungle up here.
- Yeah, just like that cafeteria.

686
00:47:44,827 --> 00:47:47,625
Well, I just humiliated myself into
the next century.

687
00:47:47,696 --> 00:47:50,790
- No! Come on.
- So this is your private hideout?

688
00:47:50,866 --> 00:47:55,428
Yeah. Thanks to the science club. Which
means my buddies don't know it exists.

689
00:47:55,504 --> 00:47:58,473
You pretty much have the school wired,
don't you, Troy?

690
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:01,976
Seems to me like everyone on campus
wants to be your friend.

691
00:48:02,044 --> 00:48:04,342
Unless we lose.

692
00:48:04,413 --> 00:48:06,779
Well, I'm sure it's tricky
being the coach's son.

693
00:48:06,849 --> 00:48:10,649
Makes me practice a little harder,
I guess.

694
00:48:11,553 --> 00:48:13,817
I don't know what he'll say
about the singing.

695
00:48:13,889 --> 00:48:17,985
- You worried?
- My parents' friends are always saying,

696
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:25,159
"Your son's the basketball guy.
You must be so proud."

697
00:48:27,402 --> 00:48:31,168
Sometimes I don't wanna be
the "basketball guy."

698
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,674
I just wanna be a guy. You know?

699
00:48:34,543 --> 00:48:38,104
I saw the way you treated Kelsi at
the audition yesterday.

700
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:40,910
Do your friends know that guy?

701
00:48:40,983 --> 00:48:43,952
To them, I'm the playmaker dude.

702
00:48:44,019 --> 00:48:45,919
They don't know enough
about you, Troy.

703
00:48:45,988 --> 00:48:49,651
At my other schools I was
the freaky math girl.

704
00:48:49,725 --> 00:48:54,526
It's cool coming here and being...
anyone I wanna be.

705
00:48:54,596 --> 00:48:58,157
When I was singing with you
I just felt like... a girl.

706
00:48:58,233 --> 00:49:00,565
You even look like one, too.

707
00:49:05,007 --> 00:49:09,376
Remember in kindergarten how you'd meet
a kid and know nothing about them,

708
00:49:09,444 --> 00:49:12,038
then ten seconds later you play
like you're best friends

709
00:49:12,114 --> 00:49:15,015
because you didn't have to
be anything but yourself.

710
00:49:15,083 --> 00:49:17,551
- Yeah.
- Singing with you felt like that.

711
00:49:19,288 --> 00:49:24,521
Well, uh... I never thought about singing.
That's for sure.

712
00:49:24,593 --> 00:49:26,652
Till you.

713
00:49:26,728 --> 00:49:30,459
So you really wanna do the callbacks?

714
00:49:30,532 --> 00:49:33,729
Hey, just call me freaky callback boy.

715
00:49:35,837 --> 00:49:37,964
You're a cool guy, Troy.

716
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:41,237
But not for the reasons your friends think.

717
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:44,746
And thanks for showing me
your top-secret hiding place.

718
00:49:44,813 --> 00:49:47,213
Like kindergarten.

719
00:50:07,769 --> 00:50:13,867
We're soarin', we're flyin'...

720
00:50:24,386 --> 00:50:25,819
Breaking...

721
00:50:34,696 --> 00:50:38,826
Creating space between us...

722
00:51:14,069 --> 00:51:17,630
There's not a star in heaven that we...

723
00:51:17,706 --> 00:51:20,106
Flyin'

724
00:51:20,175 --> 00:51:24,407
There's not a star in heaven that we...

725
00:51:25,547 --> 00:51:29,677
Let's go, guys! Make it sharp!
To the chest, come on! Pop it!

726
00:51:29,751 --> 00:51:32,345
Come on, guys. Step with it!
Let's go!

727
00:51:32,421 --> 00:51:34,821
Come on, move it! Let's go!

728
00:51:34,890 --> 00:51:38,189
Come on, guys, focus! Focus!
Get your head in the game!

729
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:39,727
Move it!

730
00:51:40,662 --> 00:51:44,496
- You seen Troy?
- No... Coach.

731
00:51:44,566 --> 00:51:46,329
Again, let's go!

732
00:52:10,025 --> 00:52:14,462
That's it, guys. Let's hit the showers.
Good hustle. Let's see that in the game.

733
00:52:18,433 --> 00:52:22,369
I, uh... think I'm gonna stay a while.
Work on some free throws.

734
00:52:22,437 --> 00:52:27,136
Since you missed practice, I think your
team deserves a little effort from you today.

735
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:40,346
Wow. So this is your real stage.

736
00:52:40,422 --> 00:52:42,788
Yeah. I guess you could call it that.

737
00:52:42,858 --> 00:52:45,088
Or just a smelly gym.

738
00:52:48,163 --> 00:52:49,562
Whoa!

739
00:52:49,631 --> 00:52:51,861
Don't tell me you're good at hoops, too.

740
00:52:51,933 --> 00:52:55,061
You know, I once scored 41 points
at a league championship game.

741
00:52:55,137 --> 00:52:57,264
- No way.
- Mm-hm. And the same day,

742
00:52:57,339 --> 00:52:59,773
I invented the space shuttle
and microwave popcorn.

743
00:52:59,841 --> 00:53:03,106
Oh! Microwave popcorn. Ha-ha. Funny.

744
00:53:06,715 --> 00:53:11,584
- I've been rehearsing with Kelsi.
- Me, too. And, by the way,

745
00:53:11,653 --> 00:53:15,419
I missed practice. So if I get kicked off
the team it'll be on your conscience.

746
00:53:16,124 --> 00:53:19,355
- Hey, I wasn't the one who told you...
- Gabriella, chill.

747
00:53:21,163 --> 00:53:24,064
Hey, that's traveling.
No, that's really bad traveling.

748
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:29,894
Miss! I'm sorry, this is a closed practice.

749
00:53:29,971 --> 00:53:32,872
- Dad, practice is over.
- Not till the last player leaves.

750
00:53:32,941 --> 00:53:35,239
- Team rule.
- Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

751
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:39,644
- Dad, this is Gabriella Montez.
- Ah, your detention buddy.

752
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:44,345
I'll see you later, Troy.

753
00:53:44,419 --> 00:53:46,580
Nice meeting you, Coach Bolton.

754
00:53:48,089 --> 00:53:49,784
You as well, Miss Montez.

755
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:54,792
Dad, detention was my fault,
not hers.

756
00:53:54,863 --> 00:53:58,663
You haven't missed practice in three years.
That girl shows up...

757
00:53:58,733 --> 00:54:02,533
That girl is named Gabriella.
She's very nice.

758
00:54:02,604 --> 00:54:05,835
Helping you miss practice doesn't
make her very nice. Not in my book.

759
00:54:05,907 --> 00:54:07,932
- Or your team's.
- Dad, she's not a problem.

760
00:54:08,009 --> 00:54:12,503
- She's just a girl.
- But you're not just a guy, Troy.

761
00:54:12,581 --> 00:54:14,981
You're the team leader.

762
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:18,713
What you do affects not only this team,
but the entire school.

763
00:54:18,787 --> 00:54:24,157
And without you completely focused,
we're not gonna win next week.

764
00:54:24,226 --> 00:54:27,662
The championship games -
they don't come along all the time.

765
00:54:27,729 --> 00:54:32,666
- They're something special.
- Yeah, a lot of things are special, Dad.

766
00:54:32,734 --> 00:54:37,171
But you're a playmaker...
not a singer, right?

767
00:54:37,239 --> 00:54:41,266
Did you ever think maybe I could be both?

768
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:54,350
- What?
- Let's go.

769
00:54:55,957 --> 00:54:59,586
What spell has this elevated-IQ
temptress girl cast

770
00:54:59,661 --> 00:55:01,856
that suddenly makes you
wanna be in a musical?

771
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:03,864
Look, I just did it. Who cares?

772
00:55:03,932 --> 00:55:07,527
Who cares? How about your most
loyal best friend?

773
00:55:07,602 --> 00:55:11,436
- Quiet in here, Mr. Danforth.
- It's him, Miss Falsaff, not me.

774
00:55:11,506 --> 00:55:17,172
Look, you're a hoops dude,
not a musical singer person.

775
00:55:17,245 --> 00:55:19,475
Have you seen Michael Crawford
on a cereal box?

776
00:55:19,547 --> 00:55:23,210
- Who's Michael Crawford?
- Exactly my point.

777
00:55:23,285 --> 00:55:25,947
He was the Phantom of the Opera
on Broadway.

778
00:55:26,021 --> 00:55:29,616
Now my mom, she's seen
that musical 27 times,

779
00:55:29,691 --> 00:55:32,353
and put Michael Crawford's picture
in our refrigerator.

780
00:55:32,427 --> 00:55:35,021
Yeah, not on it, in it.

781
00:55:35,096 --> 00:55:39,396
So my point is, if you play basketball,
you're gonna end up on the cereal box.

782
00:55:39,467 --> 00:55:42,436
If you're in musicals, you'll
end up in my mom's refrigerator.

783
00:55:42,504 --> 00:55:44,199
Why in her refrigerator?

784
00:55:44,272 --> 00:55:49,437
One of her crazy diet ideas. I won't
attempt to understand the female mind.

785
00:55:49,511 --> 00:55:51,775
It's foreign territory.

786
00:55:55,317 --> 00:56:00,414
How can you expect the rest of us to be
focused on a game if you're off somewhere

787
00:56:00,488 --> 00:56:02,285
in leotards singing "Twinkle Town"?

788
00:56:02,357 --> 00:56:04,382
No one said anything about leotards.

789
00:56:04,459 --> 00:56:06,689
Not yet, my friend, but just you wait.

790
00:56:06,761 --> 00:56:09,457
Look, we need you, Captain.
Big time.

791
00:56:09,531 --> 00:56:13,524
- Mr. Danforth.
- I tried to tell him, Miss Falsaff.

792
00:56:13,601 --> 00:56:16,069
Really tried.

793
00:56:20,008 --> 00:56:22,203
Something isn't right.

794
00:56:24,979 --> 00:56:29,575
- Hey, look. We need to talk.
- Go.

795
00:56:30,819 --> 00:56:35,256
They must be trying to figure out a way to
make sure Troy and Gabriella beat us out.

796
00:56:35,323 --> 00:56:38,656
The jocks rule most of the school,
but if they get Troy into a musical,

797
00:56:38,727 --> 00:56:41,719
then they've conquered
the entire student body.

798
00:56:41,796 --> 00:56:46,028
And if those science girls get Gabriella
hooked up with Troy Bolton,

799
00:56:46,101 --> 00:56:49,901
the scholastic club goes from drool to cool.

800
00:56:49,971 --> 00:56:53,338
Ryan, we need to save our show from
people who don't know the difference

801
00:56:53,408 --> 00:56:57,139
between a Tony Award and Tony Hawk.

802
00:56:59,013 --> 00:57:00,503
Do you think that'll work?

803
00:57:00,582 --> 00:57:04,143
It's the only way to save Troy and Gabriella
from themselves.

804
00:57:04,219 --> 00:57:05,243
- So we on?
- Yeah.

805
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:09,120
- Good. So we start tomorrow then.
- OK, the first thing.

806
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:12,557
- Nice. Let's go.
- Cool.

807
00:57:24,572 --> 00:57:27,666
So, my watch is 7:45 Mountain Standard
time. We synched?

808
00:57:27,742 --> 00:57:30,734
- Whatever.
- Then we're on go mode for lunch, 12:05.

809
00:57:30,812 --> 00:57:35,340
Yes, Chad, we're a go.
But we're not Charlie's Angels. OK?

810
00:57:35,417 --> 00:57:37,476
I can dream, can't I?

811
00:57:54,736 --> 00:57:58,900
"Spider" Bill Netrine,
class of '72.

812
00:57:58,973 --> 00:58:01,237
He was the MVP in the league
championship game.

813
00:58:01,309 --> 00:58:06,975
Sam Nedler, class of '02.
Also known as "Sammy Slamma Jamma."

814
00:58:07,048 --> 00:58:10,779
Captain, MVP of the league
championship team.

815
00:58:10,852 --> 00:58:13,912
The "Thunder Clap," Hap Hadden, '95.

816
00:58:13,988 --> 00:58:16,718
Led the Wildcats to
back-to-back city championships.

817
00:58:16,791 --> 00:58:19,851
- A legend.
- Yes. Legends, one and all.

818
00:58:19,928 --> 00:58:24,388
But do you think that any of these Wildcat
legends became legends

819
00:58:24,466 --> 00:58:28,960
by getting involved in musical auditions
days before the league championships?

820
00:58:29,037 --> 00:58:31,198
- Get your head in the game!
- No.

821
00:58:31,272 --> 00:58:33,069
These Wildcat legends became legends

822
00:58:33,141 --> 00:58:35,473
because they never took
their eye off the prize.

823
00:58:35,543 --> 00:58:37,443
Get your head in the game!

824
00:58:37,512 --> 00:58:41,312
Who was the first sophomore ever
to make starting varsity?

825
00:58:41,382 --> 00:58:44,215
- Troy!
- Who voted him team captain this year?

826
00:58:44,285 --> 00:58:47,618
- Us!
- And who is gonna get their butts kicked

827
00:58:47,689 --> 00:58:50,920
in Friday's championship game if Troy's
worried about an audition?

828
00:58:50,992 --> 00:58:53,187
- We are.
- Guys, come on.

829
00:58:53,261 --> 00:58:55,229
There's 12 people on this team,
not just me.

830
00:58:55,296 --> 00:58:57,992
Just 12? Oh, no.

831
00:58:58,066 --> 00:59:04,005
I think you're forgetting about one very
important 13th member of our squad.

832
00:59:06,841 --> 00:59:09,401
- My dad.
- Yes, Troy.

833
00:59:09,477 --> 00:59:13,538
Wildcat basketball champion,
class of 1981.

834
00:59:13,615 --> 00:59:18,746
Champion, father, and now coach.

835
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:21,983
It's a winning tradition like no other.

836
00:59:22,056 --> 00:59:26,459
From lowly Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon,
to early warriors, medieval knights.

837
00:59:26,528 --> 00:59:29,827
All leading up to...

838
00:59:29,898 --> 00:59:31,866
...lunkhead basketball man.

839
00:59:31,933 --> 00:59:36,029
Yes, our culture worshiped the aggressor
throughout the ages

840
00:59:36,104 --> 00:59:39,073
and we end up with spoiled, overpaid
bonehead athletes

841
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:44,134
who contribute little to civilization other
than slam dunks and touchdowns.

842
00:59:44,212 --> 00:59:49,377
That is the inevitable world
of Troy Bolton.

843
00:59:49,450 --> 00:59:52,283
But the path of the mind,
the path we're on,

844
00:59:52,353 --> 00:59:55,151
ours is the path that
has brought us these people:

845
00:59:56,357 --> 01:00:00,521
Eleanor Roosevelt, Frida Kahlo,
Sandra Day O'Connor,

846
01:00:00,595 --> 01:00:03,758
Madame Curie, Jane Goodall,
Oprah Winfrey

847
01:00:03,831 --> 01:00:06,800
and so many others
who the world reveres.

848
01:00:06,868 --> 01:00:11,828
Uh, but, what is?
I've got Kelsi waiting for me to rehearse.

849
01:00:11,906 --> 01:00:13,965
Gabriella!

850
01:00:14,042 --> 01:00:17,273
Troy Bolton represents one side
of evolution.

851
01:00:17,345 --> 01:00:21,008
And our side, the side of education
and accomplishment

852
01:00:21,082 --> 01:00:24,245
is the future of civilization!

853
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:27,186
This is the side where you belong.

854
01:00:28,222 --> 01:00:33,592
Guys, if you don't know that I'll put
a 110% of my guts into that game,

855
01:00:33,661 --> 01:00:34,923
then you don't know me.

856
01:00:34,996 --> 01:00:37,897
- But we just thought...
- I'll tell you what I thought.

857
01:00:37,966 --> 01:00:42,266
I thought that you're my friends.
Win together, lose together, teammates.

858
01:00:42,337 --> 01:00:47,240
- But suddenly the girl... and the singing.
- Man, I'm for the team!

859
01:00:47,308 --> 01:00:50,505
I've always been for the team.
She's just someone I met.

860
01:00:50,578 --> 01:00:54,480
All right. The singing thing is nothing.
Away to keep my nerves down.

861
01:00:54,549 --> 01:00:58,485
It means nothing to me.
You're my guys and this is our team.

862
01:00:58,553 --> 01:01:00,521
Gabriella is not important.

863
01:01:00,588 --> 01:01:05,719
I'll forget about her. Forget the audition
and we'll get that championship.

864
01:01:05,793 --> 01:01:07,124
Everyone happy now?

865
01:01:07,195 --> 01:01:10,221
Behold lunkhead basketball man.

866
01:01:13,434 --> 01:01:18,963
So, Gabriella, we'd love to have you
for the scholastic decathlon.

867
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,406
Did you wanna grab some lunch?

868
01:01:22,744 --> 01:01:25,212
Well, we'll be there if you wanna come.

869
01:01:27,215 --> 01:01:29,046
- Wildcats!
- Get your head in the game!

870
01:01:29,117 --> 01:01:30,106
Whoo!

871
01:01:31,219 --> 01:01:34,882
- Let's go!
- Go, Wildcats!

872
01:01:34,956 --> 01:01:36,924
Everybody sing out

873
01:01:36,991 --> 01:01:40,859
Wildcats everywhere
wave your hands up in the air

874
01:01:40,928 --> 01:01:45,058
That's the way we do it
let's get to it. Time to show the world

875
01:01:45,133 --> 01:01:49,126
Wildcats. Sing along.
They really got it going on

876
01:01:49,203 --> 01:01:53,162
Wildcats in the house
everybody sing out

877
01:01:53,241 --> 01:01:57,200
Wildcats everywhere,
wave your hands up in the air...

878
01:01:57,278 --> 01:02:00,008
Troy, Troy, Troy...

879
01:02:00,081 --> 01:02:04,381
It's funny when you find yourself

880
01:02:04,452 --> 01:02:08,081
Looking from the outside

881
01:02:08,389 --> 01:02:15,886
I'm standing here but all I want
is to be over there

882
01:02:15,963 --> 01:02:20,662
Why did I let myself believe

883
01:02:20,735 --> 01:02:23,966
Miracles could happen?

884
01:02:24,138 --> 01:02:32,136
'Cause now I have to pretend
that I don't really care

885
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:36,216
I thought you were my fairy tale

886
01:02:36,284 --> 01:02:40,345
A dream when I'm not sleeping

887
01:02:40,421 --> 01:02:48,055
A wish upon a star that's coming true

888
01:02:48,129 --> 01:02:52,225
But everybody else could tell

889
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:56,134
That I confused my feelings with the truth

890
01:02:58,473 --> 01:03:02,933
When there was me and you

891
01:03:04,545 --> 01:03:12,281
I swore I knew the melody
that I heard you singing

892
01:03:12,353 --> 01:03:20,317
And when you smiled you made me feel
like I could sing along

893
01:03:20,394 --> 01:03:25,058
But then you went
and changed the words

894
01:03:25,133 --> 01:03:28,227
Now my heart is empty

895
01:03:28,302 --> 01:03:35,333
I'm only left with used-to-bes
and once upon a song

896
01:03:35,977 --> 01:03:40,346
Now I know your not a fairy tale

897
01:03:40,414 --> 01:03:44,316
And dreams were meant for sleeping

898
01:03:44,385 --> 01:03:52,087
And wishes on a star
just don't come true

899
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:56,563
'Cause now even I can tell

900
01:03:56,631 --> 01:04:02,729
That I confused my feelings with the truth

901
01:04:02,804 --> 01:04:06,535
'Cause I liked the view

902
01:04:06,607 --> 01:04:10,634
When there was me and you

903
01:04:10,711 --> 01:04:15,512
I can't believe
that I could be so blind

904
01:04:15,583 --> 01:04:19,576
It's like you were floating
while I was falling

905
01:04:19,654 --> 01:04:26,958
And I didn't mind

906
01:04:30,531 --> 01:04:38,404
Because I liked the view, ooh
ooh, ooh, ooh

907
01:04:38,472 --> 01:04:42,272
I thought you felt it too

908
01:04:42,343 --> 01:04:47,610
When there was me and you

909
01:04:59,961 --> 01:05:02,691
Hey, how you doin'?

910
01:05:03,364 --> 01:05:05,127
I wanna talk to you about something.

911
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:08,862
And here it is: I know what it's like
to carry a load with your friends.

912
01:05:08,936 --> 01:05:13,373
I get it. You've got your boys, Troy.
It's OK. So we're good.

913
01:05:13,441 --> 01:05:16,171
Good about what?
I wanna talk about the final callbacks.

914
01:05:16,244 --> 01:05:19,111
I don't wanna do the callbacks either.

915
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:23,116
Who are we trying to kid?
You've got your team and I've got mine.

916
01:05:23,184 --> 01:05:26,620
I'll do the scholastic decathlon
and you'll win the championships.

917
01:05:26,687 --> 01:05:29,588
It's where we belong.

918
01:05:29,657 --> 01:05:32,023
- Go, Wildcats.
- But I...

919
01:05:32,093 --> 01:05:34,118
Me neither.

920
01:05:36,631 --> 01:05:38,462
Gabriella?

921
01:05:40,368 --> 01:05:42,734
Go Wildcats!

922
01:05:44,572 --> 01:05:47,200
Hey, Captain!

923
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:55,341
- What's with Troy?
- Don't worry about it.

924
01:06:48,569 --> 01:06:49,968
Oh, hey!

925
01:07:01,849 --> 01:07:04,044
- Troy! Hey.
- Hey, Troy!

926
01:07:26,407 --> 01:07:28,398
Hey, um...

927
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:31,640
We just had another team meeting.

928
01:07:31,712 --> 01:07:33,612
Oh... wonderful.

929
01:07:33,681 --> 01:07:37,674
We had a team meeting about how
we haven't been acting like a team.

930
01:07:37,752 --> 01:07:39,982
I mean us, not you.

931
01:07:40,054 --> 01:07:43,319
- About the singing thing...
- I don't even wanna talk about it.

932
01:07:43,391 --> 01:07:45,882
We just want you to know
that we're gonna be there.

933
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:48,087
- Cheering for you.
- Huh?

934
01:07:48,162 --> 01:07:49,720
If singing is what you wanna do,

935
01:07:49,797 --> 01:07:51,788
we should boost you up,
not tear you down.

936
01:07:51,866 --> 01:07:54,460
Yeah. Win or lose, we're teammates.

937
01:07:54,535 --> 01:07:58,972
That's what we're about. Even if you turn
out to be the worst singer in the world.

938
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:01,941
Which we don't know, because we
haven't heard you sing.

939
01:08:02,009 --> 01:08:04,534
You're not gonna hear me sing, guys.

940
01:08:04,612 --> 01:08:08,173
Because Gabriella won't even talk to me...

941
01:08:08,249 --> 01:08:10,649
...and I don't know why.

942
01:08:13,454 --> 01:08:16,150
We do.

943
01:08:16,223 --> 01:08:18,157
I baked these fresh today.

944
01:08:18,225 --> 01:08:21,956
You'll probably want to try one
before we tell you the rest.

945
01:08:22,029 --> 01:08:24,497
Gabriella, we were jerks.

946
01:08:24,565 --> 01:08:27,830
No, we were worse than jerks
because we were mean jerks.

947
01:08:27,902 --> 01:08:30,234
We thought Troy
and the whole singing thing was

948
01:08:30,304 --> 01:08:33,000
killing our chances of having you
on the scholastic decathlon team.

949
01:08:33,074 --> 01:08:35,872
I heard what he had to say.
I'm on your team now. Done.

950
01:08:35,943 --> 01:08:38,741
No, not done.

951
01:08:38,813 --> 01:08:41,043
We knew that Chad could get
Troy to say things

952
01:08:41,115 --> 01:08:44,209
to make you want to
forget about the callbacks.

953
01:08:44,285 --> 01:08:46,879
We planned it,
and we're embarrassed and sorry.

954
01:08:46,954 --> 01:08:51,254
No one forced Troy to say anything.
And you know what? It's OK.

955
01:08:51,325 --> 01:08:54,317
We should prepare for the decathlon,
it's time to move on.

956
01:08:54,395 --> 01:08:57,023
No, it's not OK.

957
01:08:57,098 --> 01:09:03,503
The decathlon is whatever, but how you
feel about us, and even more, Troy -

958
01:09:03,571 --> 01:09:06,335
that's what really matters.

959
01:09:13,747 --> 01:09:14,736
We tried.

960
01:09:33,767 --> 01:09:36,736
Hi, uh... Just came to say I'm sorry.

961
01:09:37,304 --> 01:09:43,470
- Hi, Miss Montez, I'm Troy Bolton.
- Oh, Troy!

962
01:09:44,278 --> 01:09:45,370
No.

963
01:09:45,446 --> 01:09:52,045
Um... Gabriella is kind of busy with
homework, so now's not a good time.

964
01:09:52,119 --> 01:09:58,456
I made a mistake, Miss Montez, and I
would really like to let Gabriella know that.

965
01:09:58,526 --> 01:10:05,432
- Could you tell her I came by to see her?
- I will... Troy.

966
01:10:05,499 --> 01:10:07,330
- Good night.
- Good night. Thank you.

967
01:10:38,599 --> 01:10:41,693
- Hello?
- What you heard, none of that is true.

968
01:10:41,769 --> 01:10:45,227
I was sick of my friends riding me,
so I said things to shut them up.

969
01:10:45,306 --> 01:10:46,466
I didn't mean any of it.

970
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:49,338
You sounded pretty convincing to me.

971
01:10:49,410 --> 01:10:54,177
The guy you met on vacation is more me
than the guy who said those stupid things.

972
01:10:54,248 --> 01:10:56,716
The whole singing thing
is making the school whack.

973
01:10:56,784 --> 01:11:00,584
You said so yourself. Everyone's
treating you differently because of it.

974
01:11:00,654 --> 01:11:03,418
Maybe because I don't wanna
only be the basketball guy.

975
01:11:03,490 --> 01:11:07,927
They can't handle it.
That's not my problem. It's theirs.

976
01:11:07,995 --> 01:11:10,828
- How about your dad?
- And it's not about my dad.

977
01:11:10,898 --> 01:11:14,766
This is about how I feel.
And I'm not letting the team down.

978
01:11:14,835 --> 01:11:17,065
They let me down.

979
01:11:17,137 --> 01:11:21,039
So I'm gonna sing. What about you?

980
01:11:21,108 --> 01:11:25,841
- I don't know, Troy.
- Well. You need to say yes.

981
01:11:25,913 --> 01:11:28,677
Because I brought you something.

982
01:11:28,749 --> 01:11:31,377
What do you mean?

983
01:11:31,452 --> 01:11:33,443
Turn around.

984
01:11:43,931 --> 01:11:49,961
This could be the start of something new

985
01:11:50,037 --> 01:11:55,498
It feels so right to be here with you

986
01:11:55,576 --> 01:11:57,510
Oh

987
01:11:57,578 --> 01:12:01,912
And now lookin' in your eyes

988
01:12:01,982 --> 01:12:06,510
I feel in my heart

989
01:12:06,587 --> 01:12:10,318
The start of something...

990
01:12:10,391 --> 01:12:12,222
...new

991
01:12:15,496 --> 01:12:19,193
It's a pairs audition.

992
01:12:49,330 --> 01:12:50,490
Whoo.

993
01:12:51,732 --> 01:12:53,461
Yeah!

994
01:12:53,534 --> 01:12:56,833
Zn4, and by doing that,
you end up with two...

995
01:12:56,904 --> 01:12:59,168
...and two. Got it?

996
01:13:01,308 --> 01:13:03,276
Yes!

997
01:13:06,647 --> 01:13:08,308
What's happening?

998
01:13:18,192 --> 01:13:20,683
Come here. Go ahead
and put five grams of this in,

999
01:13:20,761 --> 01:13:23,423
and that causes it to change
from an acidic state.

1000
01:13:23,497 --> 01:13:26,125
Causing the color to change from
pink to blue.

1001
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:28,464
Just like those pH strips.

1002
01:13:28,535 --> 01:13:31,436
Oh, gotta go. See you guys later!

1003
01:13:44,518 --> 01:13:46,281
Whoa!

1004
01:13:46,954 --> 01:13:48,979
You're late!

1005
01:13:49,056 --> 01:13:53,152
...strength to believe

1006
01:13:53,227 --> 01:13:55,559
We're soarin'

1007
01:13:55,629 --> 01:13:57,824
Flyin'

1008
01:13:57,898 --> 01:14:02,562
There's not a star in heaven
that we can't reach

1009
01:14:02,636 --> 01:14:04,103
Bop bop bop...

1010
01:14:04,171 --> 01:14:05,900
(Troy) If we're tryin'

1011
01:14:05,973 --> 01:14:08,032
(both) Yeah, we're breakin' free

1012
01:14:08,108 --> 01:14:09,302
(gasps)

1013
01:14:09,376 --> 01:14:12,243
Wow. They sound good.

1014
01:14:12,312 --> 01:14:13,939
(scoffs)

1015
01:14:16,383 --> 01:14:19,750
Like a wave the ocean just...

1016
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:22,118
We have to do something.

1017
01:14:22,189 --> 01:14:24,214
OK, our callback is on Thursday

1018
01:14:24,291 --> 01:14:28,887
and the basketball game
and scholastic decathlon are on Friday.

1019
01:14:28,962 --> 01:14:31,897
Too bad all these events weren't
happening on the same day...

1020
01:14:31,965 --> 01:14:34,433
...at the same time.

1021
01:14:35,402 --> 01:14:40,339
That wouldn't work out because then Troy
and Gabriella wouldn't be able to make...

1022
01:14:42,876 --> 01:14:45,071
I'm proud to call you my sister.

1023
01:14:45,145 --> 01:14:48,239
I know.

1024
01:14:48,315 --> 01:14:51,773
(Darbus) I don't want to hear any more
about Troy and that Montez girl.

1025
01:14:51,852 --> 01:14:57,688
So, if you're telling me as co-presidents of
the drama club that changing the callbacks

1026
01:14:57,758 --> 01:15:03,924
would be what's best for our theater
program, I might actually agree with you.

1027
01:15:10,070 --> 01:15:11,469
Is that a yes?

1028
01:15:13,774 --> 01:15:15,435
Bop bop bop, up to the top

1029
01:15:15,509 --> 01:15:17,443
And wipe away your inhibitions

1030
01:15:17,511 --> 01:15:21,140
Stomp, stomp, stomp
do the romp and strut your stuff

1031
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:23,615
Bop bop bop, straight to the top...

1032
01:15:33,927 --> 01:15:37,226
(Chad) No problem at all.
It was crazy, man.

1033
01:15:39,233 --> 01:15:40,791
Callbacks the same time as the game?

1034
01:15:40,868 --> 01:15:43,666
- And the scholastic decathlon.
- Why would they do that?

1035
01:15:43,737 --> 01:15:47,639
- I smell a rat named Darbus.
- I think two rats, neither named Darbus.

1036
01:15:47,708 --> 01:15:50,802
Do you know something about this,
small person?

1037
01:15:50,878 --> 01:15:53,005
Miss Darbus thinks
she's protecting the show,

1038
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:56,345
but Ryan and Sharpay are
only concerned with protecting themselves.

1039
01:15:56,416 --> 01:15:58,509
Do you know what I'll do to
those two show dogs?

1040
01:15:58,585 --> 01:16:00,883
Nothing. We're not gonna do
anything to them.

1041
01:16:00,954 --> 01:16:02,819
Except to sing, maybe.

1042
01:16:02,890 --> 01:16:05,586
Now this is only gonna happen if
we all work together.

1043
01:16:05,659 --> 01:16:09,254
- Now who's in?
- You know I'm in.

1044
01:16:24,978 --> 01:16:26,969
(classroom chatter)

1045
01:16:28,448 --> 01:16:30,780
- A pi pie.
- (gasps)

1046
01:16:30,851 --> 01:16:32,478
- Oh, my goodness!
- Oh, my gosh!

1047
01:16:32,553 --> 01:16:36,080
What? Thank you!

1048
01:16:36,156 --> 01:16:39,990
- Oh, we have something for you too.
- Yeah, come here, look.

1049
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:41,459
(both) Ta-da!

1050
01:16:41,528 --> 01:16:44,895
Oh... it's an equation.

1051
01:16:47,267 --> 01:16:49,394
Oh!

1052
01:16:49,469 --> 01:16:50,800
That's awful!

1053
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:05,180
Stay right there. Watch.

1054
01:17:05,252 --> 01:17:07,015
From our team, to yours.

1055
01:17:07,087 --> 01:17:12,150
G-o d-r-a-m-a c-l-u-b.

1056
01:17:12,225 --> 01:17:13,214
Exclamation point.

1057
01:17:13,293 --> 01:17:18,993
Well, seems we Wildcats are in for
an interesting afternoon.

1058
01:17:19,066 --> 01:17:19,964
Go.

1059
01:17:20,033 --> 01:17:25,869
G-o-d... dra... Go dra... Go dray...

1060
01:17:25,939 --> 01:17:27,702
- Ugh!
- Drame?

1061
01:17:28,575 --> 01:17:31,271
(bell ringing. Students yelling)

1062
01:17:38,452 --> 01:17:41,478
(rhythmic clapping)

1063
01:17:52,933 --> 01:17:55,766
How you feeling?

1064
01:17:55,836 --> 01:17:58,771
- Nervous.
- Yeah, me too.

1065
01:17:58,839 --> 01:18:03,833
- Wish I could suit up and play with you.
- Hey, you had your turn.

1066
01:18:05,879 --> 01:18:07,870
You know what I want from you today?

1067
01:18:07,948 --> 01:18:11,111
- The championship.
- Well, that'll come or it won't.

1068
01:18:11,184 --> 01:18:14,210
What I want is for you to have fun.

1069
01:18:14,287 --> 01:18:19,247
I know all about the pressure.
Probably too much of it has come from me.

1070
01:18:19,326 --> 01:18:24,662
What I really want is to see my son
having the time of his life

1071
01:18:24,731 --> 01:18:28,792
playing the game we both love.

1072
01:18:28,869 --> 01:18:35,900
You give me that, and I will sleep with a
smile on my face no matter what the score.

1073
01:18:38,478 --> 01:18:41,038
Thanks, Coach... uh...

1074
01:18:41,548 --> 01:18:43,243
...Dad.

1075
01:18:47,587 --> 01:18:49,953
(cheering. Drummers drumming)

1076
01:18:57,564 --> 01:19:00,294
(announcer) Welcome to
the tenth annual Scholastic Decathlon.

1077
01:19:00,367 --> 01:19:03,336
The East High Wildcats
versus the West High Knights.

1078
01:19:07,407 --> 01:19:10,137
Hello! Right here, right here.

1079
01:19:18,251 --> 01:19:19,582
(vocal gibberish)

1080
01:19:19,653 --> 01:19:21,951
- Mah, mah, mah!
- Mah, mah, mah!

1081
01:19:22,022 --> 01:19:24,047
- Eeh! Eeh!
- Ow! Ow!

1082
01:19:24,124 --> 01:19:25,250
Stop!

1083
01:19:28,962 --> 01:19:30,953
- I trust you.
- Energy.

1084
01:19:36,369 --> 01:19:38,360
- (all) Whoo!
- Come on, let's do it.

1085
01:19:41,942 --> 01:19:46,208
(announcer) And now introducing
your East High Wildcats!

1086
01:19:46,279 --> 01:19:48,179
Let's go! Go!

1087
01:19:49,449 --> 01:19:53,317
...for this championship game
between East High and West High!

1088
01:20:02,562 --> 01:20:07,090
Casting the leads of a show is both
a challenge and a responsibility.

1089
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:09,431
A joy and a burden.

1090
01:20:09,503 --> 01:20:13,940
I commend you and all other
young artists to hold out

1091
01:20:14,007 --> 01:20:19,707
for the moon, the sun and the stars.

1092
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:22,544
Shall we soar together?

1093
01:20:24,951 --> 01:20:26,919
Sharpay and Ryan!

1094
01:20:30,690 --> 01:20:32,817
Mucho gusto!

1095
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:36,595
Ay. Que fabulosa!

1096
01:20:37,264 --> 01:20:39,061
(trills tongue) Ay! Ay! Ay!

1097
01:20:39,132 --> 01:20:43,193
- Arriba!
- Quien es bailar?

1098
01:20:43,270 --> 01:20:44,965
Me la me

1099
01:20:45,038 --> 01:20:48,804
I believe in dreamin',
shootin' for the stars

1100
01:20:48,875 --> 01:20:52,936
Baby to be number one
you've got to raise the bar

1101
01:20:53,013 --> 01:20:57,313
Kickin' and a scratchin',
grindin' out my best

1102
01:20:57,384 --> 01:21:00,785
Anything it takes to climb
the ladder of success

1103
01:21:00,854 --> 01:21:05,951
(both) Work our tails off every day

1104
01:21:06,026 --> 01:21:10,122
Gotta bump the competition
blow them all away

1105
01:21:10,197 --> 01:21:12,995
- Caliente!
- Suave!

1106
01:21:13,066 --> 01:21:14,465
Yeah we're gonna

1107
01:21:14,534 --> 01:21:16,092
Bop, bop, bop
bop to the top

1108
01:21:16,169 --> 01:21:18,296
Slip and slide and ride
that rhythm

1109
01:21:18,371 --> 01:21:20,498
Jump and hop
hop till we drop

1110
01:21:20,574 --> 01:21:22,735
And start again

1111
01:21:22,809 --> 01:21:24,538
Zip zap zop
pop like a mop

1112
01:21:24,611 --> 01:21:26,511
Scoot around the corner

1113
01:21:26,580 --> 01:21:30,209
Move it to the groove
till the music stops

1114
01:21:30,283 --> 01:21:33,116
Do the bop bop,
bop to the top

1115
01:21:33,186 --> 01:21:37,316
Don't ever stop
bop to the top

1116
01:21:37,390 --> 01:21:39,290
Gimme, gimme, shimmy, shimmy

1117
01:21:39,359 --> 01:21:41,384
Wildcats!

1118
01:21:42,462 --> 01:21:46,228
(announcer)... the coveted
championship trophy!

1119
01:21:48,001 --> 01:21:49,969
(cheerleaders cheering in background)

1120
01:21:50,036 --> 01:21:51,025
(blows whistle)

1121
01:21:52,105 --> 01:21:55,563
East High wins the opening tip.
Pushing the ball up the court.

1122
01:22:02,249 --> 01:22:03,546
(ding)

1123
01:22:13,793 --> 01:22:16,125
(man) East High.

1124
01:22:16,196 --> 01:22:18,494
We did it!

1125
01:22:19,299 --> 01:22:20,391
Great job!

1126
01:22:20,467 --> 01:22:24,665
Shake some booty and turn around

1127
01:22:24,738 --> 01:22:26,706
Flash a smile in their direction

1128
01:22:26,773 --> 01:22:27,865
Show some muscle

1129
01:22:27,941 --> 01:22:29,932
Do the Hustle

1130
01:22:36,516 --> 01:22:40,748
All right, Wildcats, time for
an orderly exit from the gym.

1131
01:22:47,193 --> 01:22:48,785
(buzzing)

1132
01:22:59,205 --> 01:23:03,869
And West High pushes the ball around
the perimeter on the offensive end.

1133
01:23:03,944 --> 01:23:06,606
Nice ball movement by West High.

1134
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:08,705
Driving the lane...

1135
01:23:08,782 --> 01:23:11,273
shot is up and...

1136
01:23:11,351 --> 01:23:13,285
(buzzer sounds)

1137
01:23:13,353 --> 01:23:16,117
We seem to be experiencing
some technical difficulties.

1138
01:23:16,189 --> 01:23:18,521
(whistle)

1139
01:23:18,591 --> 01:23:20,616
We've got a timeout on the court here.

1140
01:23:20,694 --> 01:23:22,992
We have a problem.
Stop the game. Stop the game.

1141
01:23:23,063 --> 01:23:25,258
Referee has signaled timeout.

1142
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:29,600
Everyone please remain calm.

1143
01:23:42,015 --> 01:23:43,209
Go, go, go, go.

1144
01:23:47,153 --> 01:23:51,715
We'll get this figured out real soon.
In the meantime, per safety regulations,

1145
01:23:51,791 --> 01:23:55,625
we need to all make an orderly exit
from the gym, please.

1146
01:23:55,695 --> 01:23:57,560
Thank you.

1147
01:23:57,630 --> 01:23:59,757
(both) Yeah. We're gonna
bop. Bop. Bop

1148
01:23:59,833 --> 01:24:03,234
- Bop to the top
- Wipe away your inhibitions

1149
01:24:03,303 --> 01:24:04,930
Stump, stump, stump
do the romp

1150
01:24:05,005 --> 01:24:07,132
And strut your stuff

1151
01:24:07,207 --> 01:24:09,141
Bop, bop, bop
straight to the top

1152
01:24:09,209 --> 01:24:11,006
Going for the glory

1153
01:24:11,077 --> 01:24:16,709
We'll keep stepping up
and we just won't stop, stop

1154
01:24:16,783 --> 01:24:19,616
Till we reach the top

1155
01:24:19,686 --> 01:24:22,018
Bop to the top

1156
01:24:22,088 --> 01:24:24,556
(applause)

1157
01:24:34,067 --> 01:24:36,831
Oh, hi! Call me.

1158
01:24:38,338 --> 01:24:43,708
Do you see why we love the theater,
people? Well done!

1159
01:24:43,777 --> 01:24:48,874
Ah, Troy Bolton, Gabriella Montez.

1160
01:24:48,948 --> 01:24:50,677
Troy? Gabriella?

1161
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:53,617
- They'll be here.
- The theater, as I have often pointed out,

1162
01:24:53,686 --> 01:24:57,417
waits for no one. I'm sorry.

1163
01:24:58,324 --> 01:25:00,121
Well, we are done here.

1164
01:25:00,193 --> 01:25:03,822
Congratulations to all.
The cast list will be posted.

1165
01:25:03,897 --> 01:25:06,229
Wait! Miss Darbus, wait!

1166
01:25:06,299 --> 01:25:09,757
- We're ready, we can sing.
- I called your names, twice.

1167
01:25:09,836 --> 01:25:13,829
- Miss Darbus, please! Please!
- Rules are rules!

1168
01:25:13,907 --> 01:25:17,434
(students murmur)

1169
01:25:18,311 --> 01:25:21,280
We'll be happy to do it again
for our fellow students.

1170
01:25:21,347 --> 01:25:25,113
I don't know what's going on here,
but in any event,

1171
01:25:25,185 --> 01:25:27,813
it's far too late
and we have not got a pianist.

1172
01:25:27,887 --> 01:25:30,617
- Well, that's show biz.
- We'll sing without a piano.

1173
01:25:30,690 --> 01:25:33,523
Oh, no, you won't.
Pianist here, Miss Darbus.

1174
01:25:33,593 --> 01:25:37,222
- You really don't wanna do that.
- Oh, yes, I really do.

1175
01:25:37,297 --> 01:25:39,094
Ready on stage.

1176
01:25:39,599 --> 01:25:43,865
Now that's show biz.

1177
01:25:54,881 --> 01:25:57,213
(Kelsi plays intro)

1178
01:26:11,164 --> 01:26:14,133
I can't do it, Troy,
not with all these people staring at me.

1179
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:16,930
Hey, hey, look at me, right at me.

1180
01:26:17,003 --> 01:26:21,963
Right at me. Like the first time
we sang together. Remember?

1181
01:26:22,842 --> 01:26:24,503
Like kindergarten.

1182
01:26:36,322 --> 01:26:40,986
We're soarin', flyin'

1183
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:47,021
There's not a star in heaven
that we can't reach

1184
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:51,469
If we're trying so we're breaking free

1185
01:26:54,641 --> 01:26:59,476
You know the world can see us

1186
01:26:59,546 --> 01:27:03,414
In a way that's different than who we are

1187
01:27:03,483 --> 01:27:09,683
Creating space between us
till we're separate hearts

1188
01:27:12,225 --> 01:27:19,996
But your faith it gives me strength
strength to believe

1189
01:27:20,066 --> 01:27:23,092
- We're breakin' free
- We're soarin'

1190
01:27:23,169 --> 01:27:25,603
Flyin'

1191
01:27:25,672 --> 01:27:31,235
There's not a star
in heaven that we can't reach

1192
01:27:31,311 --> 01:27:33,438
If we're tryin'

1193
01:27:33,513 --> 01:27:35,708
Yeah, we're breakin' free

1194
01:27:35,782 --> 01:27:39,149
- Oh, we're breakin' free
- Oh

1195
01:27:39,219 --> 01:27:43,781
Can you feel it building

1196
01:27:43,856 --> 01:27:48,054
Like a wave the ocean just can't control

1197
01:27:48,127 --> 01:27:53,190
Connected by a feeling
Ooh, in our very soul

1198
01:27:53,266 --> 01:27:56,258
Very soul, ooh

1199
01:27:56,803 --> 01:28:04,073
Rising till it lifts us up
so everyone can see

1200
01:28:04,143 --> 01:28:05,735
We're breakin' free

1201
01:28:05,812 --> 01:28:09,805
- We're soarin'
- Flyin'

1202
01:28:09,882 --> 01:28:15,843
There's not a star in heaven
that we can't reach

1203
01:28:15,922 --> 01:28:20,291
- If we're trying
- Yeah, we're breaking free

1204
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:23,523
- Oh, we're breakin' free
- Ooh!

1205
01:28:23,596 --> 01:28:27,555
- Runnin'
- Climbin'

1206
01:28:27,634 --> 01:28:32,833
To get to that place
to be all that we can be

1207
01:28:33,706 --> 01:28:35,606
Now's the time

1208
01:28:35,675 --> 01:28:38,166
So we're breaking free

1209
01:28:38,244 --> 01:28:41,475
- We're breaking free
- Ooh, yeah

1210
01:28:41,547 --> 01:28:45,984
More than hope, more than faith
This is true, this is fate

1211
01:28:46,052 --> 01:28:50,352
And together we see it comin'

1212
01:28:50,423 --> 01:28:54,450
More than you, more than me
Not a want, but a need

1213
01:28:54,527 --> 01:28:58,793
Both of us breakin' free

1214
01:28:58,865 --> 01:29:03,359
- Soarin'
- Flyin'

1215
01:29:03,436 --> 01:29:09,204
There's not a star in
heaven that we can't reach

1216
01:29:09,275 --> 01:29:11,243
If we're tryin'

1217
01:29:11,311 --> 01:29:13,211
Yeah, we're breaking free

1218
01:29:13,279 --> 01:29:16,180
Breaking free

1219
01:29:16,249 --> 01:29:20,777
- We're runnin'
- Ooh, climbin'

1220
01:29:20,853 --> 01:29:27,315
To get to the place
to be all that we can be

1221
01:29:27,393 --> 01:29:29,759
- Now's the time
- Now's the time

1222
01:29:29,829 --> 01:29:33,356
We're breaking free
Oh, we're breaking free

1223
01:29:33,433 --> 01:29:35,060
Oh

1224
01:29:35,134 --> 01:29:39,400
You know the world can see us

1225
01:29:39,472 --> 01:29:47,470
In a way that's different than who we are

1226
01:29:51,351 --> 01:29:54,946
(applause and cheering)

1227
01:29:59,992 --> 01:30:01,323
Whoo!

1228

(announcer) And West High
pushin' the ball.

1230
01:30:17,677 --> 01:30:20,009
Fast break.
Looking for an open man.

1231
01:30:20,079 --> 01:30:23,879
Oh. But it's stolen by number 14
heading back the other way!

1232
01:30:23,950 --> 01:30:27,613
East High has the ball!
Time is running down on the clock!

1233
01:30:28,454 --> 01:30:30,718
Looking for an open man.

1234
01:30:31,157 --> 01:30:33,887
Fake. Swing to the outside.
Ball on the perimeter.

1235
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:36,451
Looks for a man on the inside.
Nice screen.

1236
01:30:36,529 --> 01:30:39,430
Shot's up! And it's good!

1237
01:30:39,499 --> 01:30:43,492
A 12-foot jump shot
as time expires for the victory!

1238
01:30:43,569 --> 01:30:50,065
East High has won the championship!
Your East High Wildcats are champions!

1239

1252
01:31:21,974 --> 01:31:23,942
We won too!

1253
01:31:24,010 --> 01:31:26,205
Yo! Team voted you the game ball,
Captain!

1254
01:31:26,279 --> 01:31:29,544
Yeah, thank you. Thanks a lot.

1255
01:31:29,615 --> 01:31:32,243
So... you're going with me to
the after-party, right?

1256
01:31:32,318 --> 01:31:35,947
- Like on a date?
- Must be your lucky day.

1257
01:31:36,022 --> 01:31:38,718
Chad just asked me out.

1258
01:31:38,791 --> 01:31:40,520
Well, congratulations.

1259
01:31:40,593 --> 01:31:43,619
I'll be the understudy
in case you can't make a show, so...

1260
01:31:43,696 --> 01:31:45,687
...break a leg.

1261
01:31:46,265 --> 01:31:49,200
In theater that means good luck.

1262
01:31:49,268 --> 01:31:53,762
Hey, Sharpay. I'm sorry you didn't get
the lead, but I think you're really good.

1263
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:57,799
- I admire you so much.
- And, why wouldn't you? Now, bye-bye.

1264
01:31:57,877 --> 01:32:01,142

1268
01:32:13,860 --> 01:32:16,829
Whoo, that's what I'm talkin' about.

01:32:49,629 --> 01:32:52,223
I finally figured out

1276
01:32:52,298 --> 01:32:53,595
Yeah, yeah

1277

That all our dreams

- We make each other strong
- (both) Each other strong

1281
01:33:10,416 --> 01:33:14,182
Were not the same,
we're different in a good way

1282
01:33:14,253 --> 01:33:18,087
Together's where we belong

We're all in this together

1284

We're gonna rock the house, yeah, yeah
