1
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:53,582
You must remember, young thespians,
learning is never seasonal.

2
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:59,683
So, do allow the shimmering lights
of summer to refresh and illuminate

3
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,422
- your fertile young minds.
- What's she talking about?

4
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:06,522
The future greets you
with its magic mirror,

5
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:13,096
reflecting each golden moment,
each emboldened choice.

6
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,801
Dude, Miss Darbus
has snapped her cap.

7
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,139
Dude, you're actually listening?

8
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:21,178
Yes, Jason.

9
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:25,273
So, what was your favorite
summer memory, Miss Darbus?

10
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:30,183
Summers have passed fleetingly
since I was your age,

11
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,589
but I remember each
with poignant clarity.

12
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,161
Summer. Summer.

13
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:39,660
Summer.

14
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:41,528
Summer.

15
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:43,697
- Summer.
- Summer.

16
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:45,362
- Summer.
- Summer.

17
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,599
- Summer. Summer.
- Ashland Shakespeare Festival of...

18
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:51,303
- Summer. Summer. Summer.
...'88 leaps fondly to mind.

19
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,989
What time is it?
Summertime

20
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:06,150
Hey
It's our vacation

21
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,694
What time is it?
Party time

22
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,353
That's right
Say it loud

23
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,523
What time is it?
The time of our lives

24
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,328
Anticipation

25
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:16,631
What time is it?
Summertime

26
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,694
School's out
Scream and shout

27
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,739
Finally summer's here

28
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:22,809
Good to be chilling out

29
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:24,867
I'm off the clock
The pressure's off

30
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,071
Now my girl's what it's all about

31
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,807
Ready for some sunshine

32
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,009
- For my heart to take a chance
- Oh, yeah

33
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,984
I'm here to stay, not moving away

34
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:35,351
Ready for a summer romance

35
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:39,222
Everybody's ready, going crazy
Yeah, we're out

36
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:43,387
Come on and let me hear you
say it now, right now

37
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,397
What time is it?
Summertime

38
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,558
Hey
It's our vacation

39
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,193
What time is it?
Party time

40
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,567
That's right
Say it loud

41
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,197
What time is it?
The time of our lives

42
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,764
Anticipation

43
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:57,275
What time is it?
Summertime

44
00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:00,039
School's out
Scream and shout

45
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:02,240
Goodbye to rules
No summer school

46
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:03,908
I'm free to shop till I drop

47
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:06,077
It's an education vacation

48
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:08,053
And the party never has to stop

49
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,282
We've got things to do
We'll see you soon

50
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,914
And we're really gonna miss you all

51
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:13,289
Goodbye to you and you

52
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,451
And you and you

53
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,722
Bye-bye until next fall

54
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:20,324
Everybody ready, going crazy
yeah, we're out

55
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:24,768
Come on and let me hear you
say it now, right now

56
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:26,965
What time is it?
Summertime

57
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:28,837
Hey
It's our vacation

58
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,433
What time is it?
Party time

59
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,001
That's right
Say it loud

60
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:35,445
What time is it?
The time of our lives

61
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:37,244
Anticipation

62
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,581
What time is it?
Summertime

63
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:42,121
School's out
Scream and shout

64
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:45,454
No more waking up at 6:00 a.m.

65
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:49,188
'Cause now our time is all our own

66
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:55,826
Enough already, we're waiting
Come on, let's go

67
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:58,666
Go out of control

68
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,098
All right

69
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,007
Everybody

70
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:11,009
Yeah

71
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:14,845
Come on

72
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:18,891
School pride, let's show it
We're champions and we know it

73
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,119
Wildcats, yeah, are the best, yeah

74
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,889
Red, white and gold

75
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,657
When it's time to win, we do it

76
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,665
We're number one, we proved it

77
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,963
Let's live it up, yeah, party down

78
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:33,200
That's what this summer's all about

79
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,364
What time is it?

80
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:37,238
Summertime is finally here
Yeah

81
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:38,470
Let's celebrate

82
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:41,537
We wanna hear you
loud and clear now

83
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:42,740
School's out

84
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:45,545
We can sleep as late as we want to

85
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:46,779
It's our time

86
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:49,788
Now we can do
whatever we wanna do

87
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,050
What time is it?

88
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,854
It's summertime

89
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,224
We'll be loving it

90
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,025
Come on and say it again now

91
00:04:58,098 --> 00:04:59,292
What time is it?

92
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,197
It's party time
Party time

93
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:05,727
Let's go and have the time of our lives

94
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,433
Let's go

95
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:10,965
Yeah

96
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:24,285
No, but seriously, guys,
this summer I gotta make bank.

97
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:26,825
My parents keep talking about
how much college is gonna cost.

98
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:28,554
Yeah, my folks are gonna match
whatever I make,

99
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:29,754
but I gotta get hired first.

100
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,162
Me, too. I'm saving up for a car,

101
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:35,963
so I can take that little hottie
on a proper date.

102
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,269
Gabriella.

103
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:43,740
I understand you've moved
every summer for the past five years,

104
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:47,744
and I'd hate to think today is goodbye.

105
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:51,807
No worries. My mom promised
I'm here until graduation next year.

106
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:54,319
Bless Mom's little heart.

107
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:58,152
Sharpay, we got off to a rough start,
but you really came through.

108
00:05:58,258 --> 00:05:59,748
I mean, you helped me
with the winter musical.

109
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,020
I did?

110
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:03,328
Those vocal exercises?

111
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,429
See you.

112
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,161
Gabriella and I have
had, like, five job interviews,

113
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:13,171
but we keep getting beat out
by college kids.

114
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:16,606
Yeah, same here. I guess I'm back
in the babysitting business.

115
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:17,973
Hey, Martha. Hey, Taylor.

116
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,376
Hey, Kelsi, what are you planning
to do this summer?

117
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,448
Grow, write music. Grow.

118
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:34,249
Your summer activities consultant
has arrived.

119
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:36,852
Hopefully some of those activities
will include a job.

120
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:41,026
Hey, whatever happens, as long
as we're together, it's cool, right?

121
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:42,701
You promise?

122
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:44,936
Here's my promise.

123
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:02,545
- "T" as in Troy?
- Well, I... Yeah.

124
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:10,523
Hey, man, how's it going?
There you go, boss.

125
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:14,459
Hoops. Let's go.

126
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:18,060
Yeah, sure, sure.
We're not busy or anything. Let's go.

127
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,101
We could go to the movies,
download music.

128
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:24,575
Oh, I'm definitely teaching you
a twisted-flip on the skateboard.

129
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:27,545
Oh, and I have first-aid training,
so I can patch myself up afterwards.

130
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:28,945
All right!

131
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,981
"Going to movies, listening to music.

132
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:37,113
"And, golly, Troy,
I have first-aid training."

133
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:38,952
Oh, please.

134
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:42,327
Oh. Come here, Kelsi.
I have a summer job for you.

135
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,384
At our country club.

136
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:46,393
Our rehearsal pianist
is evidently moving.

137
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,626
Or hiding.

138
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,668
- Pardon?
- Sounds great.

139
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:52,571
Cheer up, Shar, it's summer.

140
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,130
We can do whatever we want to.
Everything changes.

141
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:57,642
Ryan, who's the absolute primo boy
at East High?

142
00:07:57,744 --> 00:08:02,010
I'd say Troy Bolton has that category
pretty much locked up, don't you think?

143
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:04,242
And East High's primo girl?

144
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:10,782
- Just answer the question!
- Gosh, you?

145
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:18,390
Troy, Sharpay.
Sharpay, Troy. Sharpay...

146
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,863
Shar.

147
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,526
- It just makes sense.
- Evidently not to Troy.

148
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:27,369
But it's summer, Ry.
Everything changes.

149
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,385
What time is it?
Summertime

150
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:49,689
Hey
It's our vacation

151
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:52,323
What time is it?
Party time

152
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,696
That's right
Say it loud

153
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:56,065
What time is it?
The time of our lives

154
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:57,830
Anticipation

155
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,270
What time is it?
Summertime

156
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,841
School's out
Scream and shout

157
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,283
Nice workout, fellas.

158
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:17,749
- I'm starving.
- Me, too.

159
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:20,052
I'll tell you what. I'm seeing moves
I didn't see last season.

160
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,593
- Keep it coming, guys!
- Yeah. What team?

161
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:22,787
Wildcats!

162
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,056
All right!

163
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,791
Yo, time for milk.

164
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,198
- So, guys, how's the job hunt coming?
- The big zero.

165
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:34,100
- Girlfriend alert.
- Talk to me.

166
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:35,903
This is Thomas Fulton,
General Manager

167
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,943
of Lava Springs Country Club
here in Albuquerque.

168
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:40,602
I understand you've been looking
for summer work.

169
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:42,875
Hey, Troy, does Gabriella
still remember your name,

170
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:46,146
or did she find somebody new
to karaoke with this summer?

171
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,278
That sounds fantastic, Mr. Fulton.
But how did you get my name?

172
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,652
Well, we've always had
a student summer work program

173
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:54,990
here at Lava Springs.
So, are you ready?

174
00:09:55,495 --> 00:10:00,558
Here's the thing. I know the most
amazing girl... I mean, student.

175
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,692
Straight A's, quintuple straight A's,

176
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:05,965
and it would be
so amazingly perfect if...

177
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,370
Man, he's really working someone.

178
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:10,637
It can't be Gabriella.
Whenever she calls, he just blushes.

179
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,870
Yeah, I never said that.

180
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,104
Yes!

181
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:18,842
- What's up, dog?
- Nothing. Nothing. Nothing!

182
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,386
Okay. I'll tell you what,
you guys stick together this summer,

183
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,218
you work on the game,
and we are talking back-to-back

184
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:26,622
- championships next fall.
- Yeah!

185
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:32,523
Can we all redirect this energy
by carrying in the groceries?

186
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,963
- Yes, Mrs. Bolton.
- Yes, Mrs. Bolton.

187
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:38,129
Hey, we're kicking off another
hot summer here in Albuquerque.

188
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,536
So, for those cool enough
to have a convertible,

189
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,370
crank up the sound,
breathe that fresh air,

190
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,741
and say hello to summer!

191
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,167
Miss Evans, Mr. Evans,
looking very sharp this summer.

192
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:12,670
Welcome back to Lava Springs.

193
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,434
Thank you, Charles.

194
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,073
Hi, boy!

195
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,505
Oh, can you find
some shade for my car?

196
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:24,414
- Even if we have to plant a tree.
- Fulton.

197
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,747
And may I say, welcome back.

198
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,685
It's good to be home.

199
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:36,087
Are the flyers ready?

200
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,927
This year we embossed the flyers
for the show.

201
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,364
Inspired.

202
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,935
I plan to limit member talent
auditions to 30 seconds each.

203
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:48,437
Amateur performers are very...

204
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:49,634
- Draining?
- Yes.

205
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,300
Understood.

206
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:53,003
And should I...

207
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:57,913
We be so fortunate as to win
the Star Dazzle Award again.

208
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,244
But where would we put it?

209
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,481
We're planning on expanding
the trophy case.

210
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,682
The designs are in my office.

211
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,521
- Fulton, you are so efficient.
- Well...

212
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:11,088
The staffing matter we discussed?

213
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:14,266
Done. With discretion.

214
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:16,665
Fabulous.

215
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:20,864
- Oh, stop it. Yes. Yes.
- Ryan!

216
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:26,608
- Sharpay!
- Girls.

217
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,840
Your chaise in its usual spot,
Miss Evans?

218
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,006
Thank you, Javier.

219
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,515
Emma, Jackie and Lea, east of me.

220
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:35,179
Oh, and you'll be a prince to angle our
chaises on the hour, as the sun moves.

221
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,518
Well, thanks to the kind words
from your mother last season,

222
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:39,057
I've been promoted.

223
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:42,127
But, no worries,
I'll make sure that the new lifeguard

224
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:45,164
is fully briefed
on just how you like things.

225
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:50,760
So, what's the theme of
the summer talent show, Sharpay?

226
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,797
- Redemption.
- Love it.

227
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:57,968
It was a very trying year, ladies.

228
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,911
My drama department
was invaded by outsiders,

229
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:05,007
singers coming from the chemistry lab
and locker room. Shocking, really.

230
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:09,487
Sis, we've got the pool, the entire club,
and the whole summer to enjoy it.

231
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:11,387
And the spa has been redone.

232
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:15,393
There's a guacamole facial and
a seaweed body scrub on the menu.

233
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,554
What could be more fabulous?

234
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:19,960
- More ice.
- Right away, Miss Evans.

235
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:30,965
It's out with the old
And in with the new

236
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:34,104
Goodbye, clouds of gray
Hello, skies of blue

237
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,616
A dip in the pool
A trip to the spa

238
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:43,782
Endless days in my chaise
The whole world according to moi

239
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:45,889
Excuse me.

240
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:47,818
Thank you.

241
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:52,324
Iced tea imported from England

242
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:55,959
Lifeguards imported from Spain

243
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:59,300
Towels imported from Turkey

244
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:02,808
And turkey imported from Maine

245
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:06,811
We're gonna relax and renew

246
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,814
You go do

247
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:13,511
I want fabulous
That is my simple request

248
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:17,386
All things fabulous
Bigger and better and best

249
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,926
I need something inspiring
to help me get along

250
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:25,191
I need a little fabulous
Is that so wrong?

251
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:32,327
Fetch me my Jimmy Choo flip-flops

252
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:36,000
Where is my pink Prada tote?

253
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:39,670
I need my Tiffany hair-band

254
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:43,113
Then I can go for a float

255
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:46,845
A summer like never before

256
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,581
I want more

257
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:53,557
She wants fabulous
That is her simple request

258
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:57,722
All things fabulous
Bigger and better and best

259
00:14:57,797 --> 00:15:01,255
She needs something inspiring
to help her get along

260
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:05,064
She needs a little fabulous
Is that so wrong?

261
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:06,730
Fabulous pool

262
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:07,898
Fabulous splash

263
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:09,100
Read my lips.

264
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,109
Fabulous parties
Even fabulous trash

265
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,235
Fabulous fashion

266
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,404
No.

267
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,572
Fabulous bling

268
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:16,740
Yeah.

269
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:19,717
She's got to have fabulous everything

270
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:23,278
Nothing to discuss

271
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:26,881
Everything's got to be perfect for...

272
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,085
Me!

273
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:31,722
She wants fabulous
That is her simple request

274
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:35,564
All things fabulous
Bigger and better and best

275
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:39,127
She needs something inspiring
to help her get along

276
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:43,402
She needs a little fabulous
Is that so wrong?

277
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:47,276
This won't do
That's a bore

278
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:50,645
That's insulting
I need more

279
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:55,653
I need, I need, I need
I need, I need, I need

280
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:01,117
I need fabulous

281
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:04,288
I want fabulous

282
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:08,827
Fabulous hair, fabulous style

283
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:11,995
Fabulous eyes and that fabulous smile

284
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:15,541
Oh, I like what I see
I like it a lot

285
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,109
Is this absolutely fabulous?

286
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:21,943
Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous

287
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,014
Absolutely.

288
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,816
Not.

289
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:35,953
Yeah!

290
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:50,471
I got you. I got you. It's okay.

291
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,813
- What are you doing here?
- I'm the new lifeguard.

292
00:16:57,316 --> 00:17:00,183
Wait, are you a member here?

293
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:15,066
I told you to hire Troy Bolton,
not the entire East High student body!

294
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:20,071
You told me to hire Troy Bolton.
"Whatever it takes."

295
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,607
Well, why didn't you warn me
about the rest of them?

296
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,702
I did discuss the matter
with the Lava Springs board, of course.

297
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:31,578
The board. You mean, our...

298
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:32,742
Mother!

299
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:41,924
Gabriella Montez and the Wildcats?
Mother, how could you?

300
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:43,757
Think of your future, kitten.

301
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:47,765
These are your school chums,
not the fuddy-duddy Lava Springs staff.

302
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,960
These are not my chums!

303
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:53,434
They'll steal my talent show.

304
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:56,975
And what fresh talent
you'll have for your summer show.

305
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:00,106
Mother, did you hear what I just said?

306
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,113
Ryan, talk to Mother.

307
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:08,811
- Hi, Mom.
- Ducky! How's my dashing boy?

308
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,326
Tell pumpkin if she worries too much,
she'll get frown lines.

309
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,660
Namaste.

310
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,667
- I want them out!
- But your mother specifically said...

311
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,643
Oh, don't mention
that backstabbing yogini to me!

312
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:36,738
If you can't fire them,
make them wanna quit.

313
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:45,316
I'm hoping Chef Michael's
gonna teach me

314
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,585
the art of Austrian flake pastry.

315
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,754
And Sharpay's gonna be
where I work every day.

316
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:54,027
How much better can summer get?
Right? Right?

317
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,465
- A real dream come true.
- Lf you actually get to know her,

318
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:57,661
- I mean she's...
- Dude.

319
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,364
Hey, I didn't even know
Sharpay's parents owned this place.

320
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:01,531
Mr. Fulton just said, you know,

321
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:04,667
there's Wildcat fans at Lava Springs,
and jobs are available.

322
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:06,039
So, I said let's go for it.

323
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,706
Inspiring, Mr. Bolton. Truly inspiring.

324
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,783
However, what we're looking for
from all of you,

325
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:15,719
is not inspiration, but perspiration.

326
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:22,522
Confirming assignments.
Bolton, Danforth, waiters.

327
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:26,027
And, when needed, caddies.

328
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,958
What?

329
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:32,329
Miss McKessie,
I'm told that you're efficient.

330
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:34,305
- Well...
- Prove it.

331
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:38,332
You'll handle member activities.
Keep me in sight at all times.

332
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:43,348
Kelsi, piano.
Lunchtime and cocktail hour.

333
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:47,876
That means mood music,
not new music.

334
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,211
Capisce?

335
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:52,985
Martha, chopping, cutting,
preparing plates.

336
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:55,425
Do complete the summer
with the equal amount of digits

337
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,894
I assume you currently possess.

338
00:19:57,997 --> 00:20:01,933
Oh, Zeke, you will assist Chef Michael
in the...

339
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,399
The promised land.

340
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:04,730
You hold on to that.

341
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:06,429
Mr. Fulton, Your Excellency, sir,

342
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:10,703
would it be okay if we draw straws
to see who has to wait on Sharpay?

343
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:14,007
Please, none of you
will be waiting on Sharpay.

344
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,411
Oh, yes. Snap.

345
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:18,574
- You will be serving Miss Evans.
- Who's that?

346
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:24,182
Always address our members as Mr.,
Mrs., or Miss. Let's practice.

347
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:25,951
- Do we have to?
- Shall we?

348
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,255
"Miss Evans,
would you care for lemonade?"

349
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:32,525
Actually, I'm not Miss Evans. I'm Jason.

350
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,597
- It smells so good and I am so hungry.
- No, wait. You don't...

351
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:39,728
- No, no, no.
- What's for lunch?

352
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:41,238
Miss Montez.

353
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:45,475
It would seem your lunch break
does not start for 3.5 minutes.

354
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,744
I do hope no members drowned
in your absence.

355
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:52,944
Henceforth, do clock in
and out on time.

356
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:58,046
Three infractions of any kind,
and your employment is terminated.

357
00:20:58,591 --> 00:20:59,819
Capisce?

358
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,221
Chop, chop, chop.

359
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,830
- Okay, that man officially scares me.
- Yeah.

360
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,765
Suddenly, I'm beginning to miss
detention with Miss Darbus.

361
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:11,068
- How sick is that?
- Come on.

362
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,001
We got a hoop out back,
two free meals a day,

363
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,337
and we only have to wear
these stupid outfits on duty.

364
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,809
All for one, and one for all. All right?

365
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:23,473
- This is our summer. Now, what team?
- Wildcats!

366
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:25,106
- What team?
- Wildcats!

367
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:26,276
Come on.

368
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:30,254
How did we get from the top of
the world to the bottom of the heap?

369
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:34,122
I don't recall you mentioning
the boss is such a creep

370
00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:37,629
We still have the ingredients
to make this summer sweet

371
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:40,426
Well, we got rags instead of riches

372
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,524
And all these dirty dishes

373
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,866
Just wish I had three wishes

374
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,495
Okay, guys, break it up.

375
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:51,975
We've got to work, work
to work this out

376
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:55,605
We'll make things right
The sun will shine

377
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:59,310
If we work, work, there'll be no doubt

378
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:05,221
We can still save the summer
if we work this out

379
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:07,719
Dude, what have you gotten us into?

380
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,887
Come on.
We can totally turn this thing around!

381
00:22:11,464 --> 00:22:15,298
I'd rather face a seven footer
straight up in the post

382
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,562
Yeah
That sure beats hanging here

383
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,729
And burning someone's toast

384
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,400
I needed Benjamins
But this ain't worth the stress

385
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:27,003
Maybe there's a better way
to fix this greasy mess

386
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:31,140
We're a champion team
A well-oiled machine

387
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:35,153
And we've faced tougher problems
than this

388
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:39,157
I know it's a grind
But I'm sure we can find

389
00:22:39,225 --> 00:22:42,854
A way to have fun
while we get this job done

390
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:46,989
We've got to work, work
to work this out

391
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:50,661
We'll make things right
The sun will shine

392
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:54,433
We got to work, work
There'll be no doubt

393
00:22:54,540 --> 00:23:01,036
If we all come together
We can work this out

394
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:03,705
Let's work it!

395
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:28,470
Tell me what you want

396
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,405
Tell me what you need

397
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:31,534
A little bit of sugar

398
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,702
A little bit of butter

399
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:34,268
It's the perfect recipe

400
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,211
Payday
It'll taste so sweet

401
00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:38,477
Payday
Good enough to eat

402
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,711
Gonna make some motion pictures

403
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:42,720
Hit the mall with all my sisters

404
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,813
Get tickets to the Knicks and Sixers

405
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,721
Kick it with the music mixers

406
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,589
Buy a ride that suits my style

407
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:50,458
Lounge around the pool awhile

408
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:52,428
Make a date with my favorite girl

409
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:54,557
We've got it made

410
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:59,900
Whoa, we've got to work, work
to work this out

411
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:03,635
We'll make things right
The sun will shine

412
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:07,405
If we work, work, there'll be no doubt

413
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:13,179
We can still save the summer
If we work this out

414
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,186
Work this
Got to work this

415
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,620
We can work this out

416
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:23,295
So, can we work this out?

417
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:25,686
Yeah, we can work it out.

418
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,026
Send the waiters right in.

419
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:48,281
Miss me? Of course you did.

420
00:24:48,554 --> 00:24:51,182
Hey, you ever been on a golf course?

421
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:54,691
We're employees, Troy. Not members.
And I don't play golf.

422
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:56,988
Who said anything about golf?

423
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:03,897
Are you sure it's okay for us
to be out here?

424
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,699
Yeah, unless the jackrabbits turn us in.

425
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:10,140
So, how's kitchen duty?

426
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:14,339
Oh, you know, the team that
washes dishes together, wins together.

427
00:25:17,216 --> 00:25:19,707
My mom said summer jobs look good
on college applications.

428
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:23,219
All part of the frightening concept
called "our future."

429
00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:24,880
Are you worried?

430
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:28,386
Hey, college costs a fortune.

431
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,852
My parents are saving pennies,
unlike the people at this place.

432
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,261
You're a cinch for a scholarship.

433
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:37,028
I'm only as good as whatever happens
next season. It's...

434
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:40,037
I always liked the idea of
being in charge of my future,

435
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:41,504
until it actually started happening.

436
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:44,167
So, let's just think about right now,

437
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:47,679
because I've never been in one place
for an entire summer,

438
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:51,375
and this means a lot to me,
especially being here with...

439
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:55,580
Such an outstanding peanut-butter
and-jelly-sandwich maker like me?

440
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:58,414
I want to remember this summer, Troy.

441
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,721
- Here, catch.
- Oh, I love this game.

442
00:26:03,462 --> 00:26:05,123
- Ready?
- Go.

443
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:10,863
- Beautiful.
- Very nice! Oh. Your turn.

444
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,040
- You didn't catch a single one of them.
- You...

445
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:18,736
That was so bad.

446
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:23,909
Fulton, when I was
on the fourth fairway today,

447
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,246
it seemed bone dry.

448
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:27,984
Oh, no way!

449
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:33,786
Could you tell maintenance
to give it a little extra splash?

450
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:49,938
No way!

451
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:55,838
- May I have this dance?
- Why, of course you may.

452
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,575
Let's go then.

453
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:03,619
You are gonna get so wet!

454
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:07,917
Yeah!

455
00:27:12,598 --> 00:27:15,192
Keep an eye on them tomorrow
and keep me posted.

456
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,426
Why are you smiling?

457
00:27:16,502 --> 00:27:20,632
No worries, Ryan.
This is our turf, remember?

458
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,770
First a break-time infraction,
now frolicking on the golf course.

459
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:30,679
We are not off to an auspicious start,
are we, Miss Montez?

460
00:27:30,783 --> 00:27:32,148
Actually, Mr. Fulton, this was my idea,
so she's...

461
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:35,186
How gallant, but irrelevant.

462
00:27:35,621 --> 00:27:38,522
We won't allow this to happen again,
will we?

463
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,021
Good morning, everybody.

464
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:47,155
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

465
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:49,166
- Smells good. That smells good.
- Hey, Martha.

466
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:50,997
- Hey.
- Hey, Jason.

467
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,404
- Hey, morning.
- What's up?

468
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:08,142
Yeah
You are the music in me

469
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,848
- Sounding good, Kels.
- Thanks.

470
00:28:10,923 --> 00:28:13,517
Actually, I need to go get ready
for the ladies' luncheon.

471
00:28:13,592 --> 00:28:15,822
Won't exactly be rocking out.

472
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:19,091
You know, I am so excited
about the club's talent show.

473
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:20,893
I mean, the employees
get to do a number,

474
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,762
and I have ideas for everyone.

475
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:23,994
You guys can sing the lead,

476
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:25,502
and maybe Zeke and Chad
can do backup,

477
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:26,731
and everyone can dance.

478
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:28,204
Big timeout on that one.

479
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:31,538
My singing career began and ended
with the East High Winter Musical.

480
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:34,101
I'm just here to make a check
and sneak in the pool after work.

481
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:36,044
That's... That's really it.

482
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,508
What was that
you were playing a minute ago?

483
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:41,382
Oh, it's... It's nothing. It's just nothing.

484
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:42,579
What's this?

485
00:28:42,688 --> 00:28:45,020
Well, I was thinking
if you'd do the show,

486
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:49,459
that I wanted to be ready,
and I wrote this for you guys.

487
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,550
Come on. Go.

488
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,036
Yeah

489
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,605
You are the music in me

490
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:07,876
You know the words
"Once upon a time"

491
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:12,246
Make you listen, there's a reason

492
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:17,410
When you dream
There's a chance you'll find

493
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:22,552
A little laughter, or happy ever after

494
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:27,497
You're harmony to the melody

495
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,330
That's echoing inside my head

496
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:36,965
A single voice above the noise

497
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:39,635
And like a common thread

498
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:41,942
You're pulling me

499
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:47,813
When I hear my favorite song
I know that we belong

500
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,412
Oh, you are the music in me

501
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:54,323
Yeah, it's living in all of us

502
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:57,293
And it's brought us here because

503
00:29:57,362 --> 00:30:00,991
Because you are the music in me

504
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:07,505
Yeah, yeah, yeah

505
00:30:07,606 --> 00:30:10,268
You are the music in me

506
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:16,008
It's like I knew you before we met
Can't explain it

507
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:19,345
There's no name for it

508
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:23,217
I sang you words I've never said

509
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,847
- And it was easy
- So easy

510
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:28,688
Because you see the real me

511
00:30:28,794 --> 00:30:33,026
As I am, you understand

512
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:38,034
And that's more than
I've ever known, oh

513
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:42,573
To hear your voice above the noise

514
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,541
And know I'm not alone

515
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:48,238
Oh, you're singing to me

516
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:53,649
When I hear my favorite song
I know that we belong

517
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:57,554
You are the music in me

518
00:30:57,656 --> 00:31:00,489
It's living in all of us

519
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,585
And it's brought us here because

520
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:09,190
You are the music in me

521
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:12,532
Together we're gonna sing

522
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:18,071
We got the power to sing what we feel

523
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:20,235
Connected and real

524
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:24,179
Can't keep it all inside

525
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,513
Oh, yeah

526
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:29,244
Oh, yeah

527
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:32,016
- Oh, yeah
- Yeah, yeah, yeah

528
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:35,355
You are the music in me

529
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,885
Oh, yeah

530
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,191
Oh, yeah

531
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,967
You are the music in me

532
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:49,439
When I hear my favorite song
I know that we belong

533
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:51,099
We belong

534
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:53,905
You are the music in me

535
00:31:54,479 --> 00:32:00,418
It's living in all of us
It's brought us here because

536
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:03,545
You are the music in me

537
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:08,920
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

538
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:13,626
You are the music in me

539
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:16,130
Yeah

540
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:21,666
- Oh, I love that song.
- Great job, Kels.

541
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:25,903
Oh, I've got the talent show sign-up
sheet right here. Are you in?

542
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:33,917
Maybe we can work this out,
but only if we're all in this together.

543
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:35,748
Yeah!

544
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:37,413
This is going to be fantastic.

545
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:40,253
I'm going to coordinate rehearsal
to coincide with all of our schedules.

546
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:43,817
Goldenthroat, this is Jazz Square.
We may have trouble.

547
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:48,527
Now, it's an amazing song,
but Kelsi didn't write it for us.

548
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,759
Hi, Mom.

549
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:51,826
- Seaweed scrub, darling?
- Maybe later.

550
00:32:51,937 --> 00:32:55,600
Ryan, it might be wonderful
if Troy participates in our talent show.

551
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:57,972
What? If he sings with Gabriella

552
00:32:58,043 --> 00:33:00,807
then our whole show is going to be
the "Troy and Gabriella Show."

553
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:02,938
I'm not certain Gabriella
is ideally suited

554
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:06,506
to help Troy realize his full potential
at Lava Springs.

555
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:08,449
Mommy, what time
is Daddy gonna be here?

556
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,681
We tee off at noon. Join us?

557
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:12,650
Love to.

558
00:33:16,128 --> 00:33:18,722
Up. And how shall
we get to the food today, sir?

559
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,298
- I don't know, perhaps skipping.
- Very well then.

560
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:22,799
Shall we?

561
00:33:22,868 --> 00:33:26,395
Hipty scouty, hipty skipty,
hipty skipty, hipty skipty...

562
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:30,134
Danforth, Bolton,
you're caddying today.

563
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,039
$40 a bag. You've been requested.

564
00:33:32,144 --> 00:33:33,634
- What?
- By who?

565
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:36,579
Dude, who cares?
For $40, I'd caddy for Godzilla.

566
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,376
Close, very close.

567
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:40,849
Thank you.

568
00:33:41,253 --> 00:33:43,050
- Thanks.
- Thanks, man.

569
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:51,519
Hey, boys! So, Troy, I thought
it was time for you to meet my parents.

570
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:54,690
Enchantee.

571
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:56,495
- Awesome.
- Hi.

572
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:57,860
Hello.

573
00:33:57,936 --> 00:33:59,767
So, where's your dad?

574
00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:16,019
Hi, Daddy!

575
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:21,055
Where's the first tee
and what's the course record?

576
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:30,061
I'm just kidding. I built the course
myself and I hold the record,

577
00:34:30,135 --> 00:34:32,399
but who's counting? Princess.

578
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:37,369
- Son, you've been working out.
- Yoga.

579
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:41,444
Bring that around, there you go.
Quite a season you boys had.

580
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:44,071
Oh, Troy played
for the golf team, too, Daddy.

581
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:47,380
Oh, versatile. How about you, son?

582
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:49,818
- Baseball. Track and field.
- Outstanding.

583
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:53,322
Might come in handy the way
I play golf. Fair warning.

584
00:34:56,995 --> 00:34:58,257
Fore!

585
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:05,263
- Brilliant, darling. Brilliant.
- Lovely.

586
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:10,301
Chad, you'll be caddying for Mother.
Troy, Daddy.

587
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:12,970
Daddy.

588
00:35:14,246 --> 00:35:15,611
Bravo!

589
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,841
Brilliant. Let's take a walk.

590
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:20,146
- Is that a new outfit?
- Yes, I got it just this morning.

591
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:22,743
- And yours?
- This old thing? I got it last week.

592
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:26,012
Come on, Chad.

593
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:30,959
What do you think?

594
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:34,465
Well, it's 190 to the pin,
downhill lie, elevated green.

595
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:36,762
I'd go with a full five, sir.

596
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:40,663
Hi.

597
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:50,314
- Nice call.
- All right.

598
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:58,880
Princess, grab your pitching wedge.
This one's yours.

599
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,480
Thanks, Daddy.

600
00:36:04,863 --> 00:36:06,228
Line it up.

601
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:16,868
That's my girl.

602
00:36:16,975 --> 00:36:19,535
That girl needs to take up knitting.

603
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:21,475
Or some sport
where she can only injure herself.

604
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:23,707
- I'm in the sand.
- Me, too.

605
00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:32,149
Knees, hips, shoulders, hat.
Good. Drill it.

606
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:35,023
Backboard.

607
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:36,852
Yes!

608
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,685
That's my boy.

609
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:53,067
- Where...
- I have no idea.

610
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:58,539
Gabriella! Dinner tonight?
Sneak a swim?

611
00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:01,178
Troy!

612
00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:11,057
- Oh, lovely, darling.
- Nice.

613
00:37:11,129 --> 00:37:13,256
Daddy, why not let Troy try a shot?

614
00:37:13,365 --> 00:37:15,526
- Of course. Of course.
- No, I shouldn't.

615
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,862
- Come on.
- Are you sure?

616
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:18,300
- Yeah!
- Yes, sir.

617
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:21,304
- Are you sure it's okay, Mr. Evans?
- It sure is.

618
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:23,704
- Give it a ride.
- Thank you.

619
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:25,140
- Here you go, Daddy.
- Thank you, dear.

620
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:34,076
- That's a beautiful swing.
- Really beautiful.

621
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:37,385
That is a beautiful swing.

622
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,321
- That was awesome.
- Thanks, man.

623
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:43,724
- Come on! What do you say we...
- What? I don't know.

624
00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:45,327
Off we go.

625
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:52,164
I'm saving up for a car.
I'm saving up for a car.

626
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,353
Well, Tiger Woods would
have been proud to make that putt!

627
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:15,557
What a shame that Troy
is only bussing dishes all summer,

628
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:18,095
given that he's a potential star
for your alma mater, Daddy.

629
00:38:18,196 --> 00:38:20,391
I've seen Troy play basketball.

630
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:23,366
I think the U of A Redhawks
will be very interested in him.

631
00:38:23,435 --> 00:38:28,202
That's inspired, Daddy.
Troy is very concerned about college.

632
00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:29,433
- Really?
- Yeah.

633
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:31,805
- How's Coach Bolton these days?
- Oh, fantastic.

634
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,400
Outstanding.

635
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:37,905
What?

636
00:38:38,383 --> 00:38:41,113
Oh, next time
I see Country Club Princess,

637
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:43,619
I'm gonna launch her and her pink cart
straight into the lake.

638
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:44,949
I'll build the ramp, buddy.

639
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:48,150
Danforth, this is a kitchen,
not a day spa.

640
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,989
You and Jason suit up for dinner duty
in the dining room.

641
00:38:51,096 --> 00:38:54,497
Bolton, you have five minutes
to change and come with me.

642
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:57,295
In case you're not familiar
with this particular item,

643
00:38:57,402 --> 00:38:59,393
it goes around your neck,

644
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:02,640
like a dog collar.

645
00:39:03,408 --> 00:39:04,807
Chop-chop.

646
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:11,844
- And she stepped on the ball.
- I did not.

647
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:14,578
- Yes, you did.
- I can believe that.

648
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:18,952
Hey! Here's our superstar.
Troy Bolton, this is Peter.

649
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,422
- Peter. Good to meet you.
- How are you?

650
00:39:20,492 --> 00:39:21,584
- This is Claire.
- Hello.

651
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:23,650
- And you know the family.
- Hello.

652
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:27,322
This kid's pretty handy on the fairways
as well as the hard court.

653
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:28,865
Bet you worked up yourself an appetite

654
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:30,662
lugging those bags
all over the place, huh?

655
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:31,826
Yeah, yeah. A little bit.

656
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:34,598
What do you say we get some food,
and we can talk about your future.

657
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,537
- My future?
- Yeah, sit down.

658
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:38,165
Have a seat.

659
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:41,211
Daddy's on the board of directors
at the University of Albuquerque.

660
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:45,715
So, Troy, I saw your
championship game. I mean, wow!

661
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:48,718
That last-second shot at the buzzer...
Outstanding.

662
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,152
Actually, my teammates here
stole the ball,

663
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,519
otherwise I wouldn't have
had a chance...

664
00:39:52,624 --> 00:39:54,854
Oh, you're much too modest, Troy.

665
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:57,689
You were voted MVP
for the entire season.

666
00:40:00,298 --> 00:40:03,529
This shirt positively screams
for a Windsor knot.

667
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:05,902
- Thank you.
- Let me get that for you.

668
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:13,973
You know, we've got a heck of
a basketball program over at U of A,

669
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,069
and an excellent
scholarship program as well.

670
00:40:16,181 --> 00:40:17,546
Scholarship?

671
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:20,476
Yeah. You know,
between the two of us here,

672
00:40:20,552 --> 00:40:23,749
we... We pull a little weight over
at the school.

673
00:40:25,557 --> 00:40:29,425
Well, time flies when you're having fun,

674
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:32,519
but Mr. Fulton will probably
want me clocking out.

675
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:34,092
Come on. Don't be silly.

676
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:36,929
You haven't had any dessert,
and we haven't talked about golf, yet.

677
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:40,334
Oh, basketball and golf are
just the beginning with Troy, Daddy.

678
00:40:40,405 --> 00:40:42,032
Have you heard him sing?

679
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,869
Oh, triple threat.

680
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:47,207
Oh, how wonderful.
Troy can participate in the talent show.

681
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:50,509
Oh, come on, Troy.
Give them a sample. Kelsi!

682
00:40:50,582 --> 00:40:54,018
Kelsi. No, actually my voice is...

683
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:56,781
Is feeling a little bit hoarse tonight,
you know, all the talking.

684
00:40:56,888 --> 00:41:00,449
But thank you very much for the food
and the golf and everything.

685
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:01,718
It was amazing.

686
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:06,787
But you will sing some other time,
though? With me. Promise?

687
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:15,869
- Promise.
- Perfect.

688
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:19,238
Dessert?

689
00:41:40,765 --> 00:41:42,960
Sorry I'm late!
Give me two more minutes.

690
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:46,332
Nice tie. Your shoes
don't match though. Kidding.

691
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:57,411
Honey, two minutes is being late,
but an hour is approaching a felony.

692
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,348
Just because Troy's a nice guy, doesn't
mean he's immune to boy disease.

693
00:42:00,418 --> 00:42:01,442
Boy disease?

694
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:03,019
Yeah, forgetting things
he shouldn't forget.

695
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:04,520
Oh, so now you're a boy expert?

696
00:42:04,589 --> 00:42:07,524
My older sister has 10 rules
about boy behavior,

697
00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:09,355
and nine of them involve boys
forgetting things

698
00:42:09,427 --> 00:42:12,123
they should never forget,
like dinner dates.

699
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,926
Well, it wasn't an official date
type of thing.

700
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:18,600
Rule number three,
all dates are official,

701
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:20,227
whether the boy knows it or not.

702
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:27,301
- You're not done.
- But I'm done for the day, sir.

703
00:42:27,412 --> 00:42:28,436
And actually, I have a date.

704
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,741
Mr. Bolton, you're under
the mistaken impression

705
00:42:30,815 --> 00:42:33,875
I'm interested in what you have to say.
Just follow me.

706
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:36,044
- But I...
- No more speaking.

707
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:49,065
- Hey, where are we going?
- Please, Mr. Bolton.

708
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:51,499
- How long is this gonna take?
- Watch your step. Insurance issues.

709
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:52,626
I'm supposed to have a date tonight.

710
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:55,638
But the evening is young
and so are you.

711
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,173
Well, where are we?

712
00:42:57,608 --> 00:43:00,304
Hold your applause until the very end.

713
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:06,441
What the heck? Mr. Fulton?

714
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:21,493
A long time ago
In a land far away

715
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,124
Lived the pineapple princess, Tiki

716
00:43:24,202 --> 00:43:27,137
She was sweet as a peach
In a pineapple way

717
00:43:27,205 --> 00:43:29,765
But so sad that she hardly speaky

718
00:43:31,042 --> 00:43:34,876
Still, if you listen well
You'll hear her secret wish

719
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:36,879
Aloha, everybody, my name is Tiki.

720
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:40,678
I long to free
A truly remarkable fish

721
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:42,844
My sweet prince

722
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:45,514
Humu, humu, nuku, nuku, a pua'a

723
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:48,319
Makahiki malihini who

724
00:43:48,393 --> 00:43:53,126
Humu, humu, nuku, nuku, a pua'a
Ooh

725
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:57,657
Hawana waka, waka, waka
Niki pu, pu, pu

726
00:43:57,735 --> 00:43:59,396
Ryan, the fog!

727
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:03,701
She dreams of a boy
Who is under a spell

728
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:06,470
That has left him all wet and scaly

729
00:44:06,544 --> 00:44:09,342
I sing from my heart
Of the power of love

730
00:44:09,414 --> 00:44:11,848
Just a girl with a ukulele

731
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:15,509
- Come to me
- Come to her

732
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:18,020
- My sweet one, and be still
- Be still

733
00:44:19,524 --> 00:44:23,016
I'll grasp your tail
Then stroke each tender gill

734
00:44:23,094 --> 00:44:25,221
My sweet prince

735
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,991
Humu, humu, nuku, nuku, a pua'a

736
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:30,761
Makahiki malihini who

737
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:35,430
Humu, humu, nuku, nuku, a pua'a
Ooh

738
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:39,169
Hawana waka, waka, waka
Niki pu, pu, pu

739
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:42,701
Now this is where we lead
into the whole Kabuki thing.

740
00:44:43,381 --> 00:44:46,179
The clouds turned gray
And the big sky cried

741
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,343
And the ocean had a fit

742
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:50,387
Ryan! Where's my ocean?

743
00:44:50,455 --> 00:44:53,219
Then the wind went whoosh
And thunder cracked

744
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:58,695
And mighty Mount Fufu spit
Mighty Mount Fufu spit

745
00:44:58,763 --> 00:45:01,698
Tiki, Tiki
Want to speaky, speaky, speaky

746
00:45:01,766 --> 00:45:04,132
With the mighty spirit Fufu

747
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:07,136
Tiki, Tiki
Want to speaky, speaky, speaky

748
00:45:07,238 --> 00:45:09,604
- The words I will not mince
- Word!

749
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:13,907
Please make a man
Of my fresh fish prince

750
00:45:13,978 --> 00:45:16,276
This is real fish talk. No lie.

751
00:45:27,792 --> 00:45:30,886
And then the fish turns
into a gorgeous prince and sings...

752
00:45:30,962 --> 00:45:33,123
I'm Prince Humu
Humu, nuku, nuku, a pua'a

753
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:34,221
No. No way.

754
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,298
Makahiki malihini who

755
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,458
With me.

756
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:41,060
Humu, humu, nuku, nuku, a pua'a

757
00:45:41,973 --> 00:45:47,468
Hawana waka, waka, waka
Niki pu, pu, pu

758
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:48,636
Everybody!

759
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,408
Humu, humu, nuku, nuku, a pua'a

760
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:54,144
Makahiki malihini who

761
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:57,653
Humu, humu, nuku, nuku, a pua'a

762
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:02,756
Hawana waka, waka, waka
Niki pu, pu, pu

763
00:46:02,827 --> 00:46:05,523
Waka, waka, waka
Niki pu, pu, pu

764
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:11,262
Waka, waka, waka
Niki pu, pu, pu

765
00:46:17,041 --> 00:46:18,474
One minute.

766
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:37,519
We'll talk about this later.

767
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:39,994
So, you love it?

768
00:46:40,064 --> 00:46:42,555
Look, you ever tried just singing?

769
00:46:42,667 --> 00:46:46,660
I mean, without all the lights and sets
and, like, backup people?

770
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,837
Well, it'd be much harder
to get applause that way.

771
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:51,670
I'm not talking about applause.

772
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:54,233
I'm talking about hanging out
with friends.

773
00:46:54,345 --> 00:46:56,677
You know, doing nothing,
and singing for fun.

774
00:46:57,181 --> 00:47:01,015
Wait a minute. Not doing anything.

775
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:06,348
That might work.
A dark stage, a single spotlight.

776
00:47:06,424 --> 00:47:09,985
We break out of darkness
into the circle of light.

777
00:47:10,061 --> 00:47:11,653
- Wait, "we"?
- No set, no frills.

778
00:47:11,729 --> 00:47:13,697
- Oh, man.
- Simple.

779
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:16,324
Dramatic. Just you and me.

780
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:20,529
That is such a great idea, Troy.
We could do it at our club talent show.

781
00:47:20,605 --> 00:47:22,095
Look, I'm here to work.

782
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:25,198
Sharpay, I already told you
being onstage really is your thing,

783
00:47:25,276 --> 00:47:26,834
it's not mine.

784
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:30,109
It could be our thing.

785
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:33,783
Time out on that one, okay?
I've got an "our thing,"

786
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:36,512
it's with Gabriella, and...
And I'm very late for her, so I got to go.

787
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:39,852
- But the show could be so amazing...
- I love your shoes.

788
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:41,618
- You like them?
- I really do.

789
00:47:41,726 --> 00:47:45,127
I bought them in New York.
I have them in nine colors.

790
00:47:48,299 --> 00:47:50,563
Girls! Again from the top.

791
00:48:14,659 --> 00:48:17,628
Hey, lifeguard!

792
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:22,298
You're crazy, Wildcat!

793
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,731
And so late, but I brought food,
a few little candles.

794
00:48:26,804 --> 00:48:28,897
I'm good for a poolside picnic.
What do you say?

795
00:48:28,973 --> 00:48:33,410
Zeke even made desserts.
But first, I dare you to jump in.

796
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:37,174
You know we're not supposed
to be in the pool. Club rules.

797
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:41,684
Cramp!

798
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:48,358
I need a lifeguard!
Rescue me! Rescue me!

799
00:48:49,794 --> 00:48:51,284
Here I come!

800
00:49:05,476 --> 00:49:08,036
Thanks for coming in. Follow me.

801
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:37,507
Oh, listen.

802
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:44,511
You know, right now, with you,

803
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,752
it's finally starting to feel like summer.

804
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:51,811
Yeah, it is.

805
00:49:55,526 --> 00:49:57,016
The water bugs are back.

806
00:49:57,094 --> 00:50:00,257
Look, Mr. Fulton, this was my idea,
she had nothing to do with it.

807
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:03,663
I generously overlooked
your previous break violation,

808
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:05,895
but then came the golf course jaunt,

809
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:09,769
and now this. Two strikes.

810
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:14,606
Don't get a third. Out of the pool.

811
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,515
Sharpay's dad let me play a few holes

812
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:24,417
and then invited me to dinner
with some U of A alumni.

813
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:25,580
Really?

814
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,384
And they were talking
about scholarships,

815
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:30,359
while Jason and Chad
were, like, serving me.

816
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,893
And getting paid for it. It's called a job.

817
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:34,692
You were invited,
nothing wrong with that.

818
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:37,029
Yeah. I don't know. It felt weird.

819
00:50:37,101 --> 00:50:39,695
I love that you've got the team
working together,

820
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:41,465
but you're not gonna be
a Wildcat forever.

821
00:50:41,572 --> 00:50:45,064
The team is now, and that's... It's good,

822
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:47,406
but everybody's got their own future.

823
00:50:47,478 --> 00:50:49,912
I'm not sure I know what you mean.

824
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:54,083
Well, when you graduate,

825
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:56,915
lots of people are gonna be
chasing the same opportunities.

826
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:59,751
There's nothing wrong with
keeping your eye on the prize.

827
00:50:59,824 --> 00:51:01,917
In fact, if you don't, you get left behind.

828
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:04,654
Yeah, I know, I'm just saying,
I didn't get my friends jobs at the club

829
00:51:04,762 --> 00:51:07,492
so they could sit and watch me
eat in the dining room.

830
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:09,498
You know, I'm just saying
never be ashamed of attention,

831
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,158
as long as you've earned it.

832
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:12,758
You know, a scholarship's special,

833
00:51:12,837 --> 00:51:14,270
that's why there's only a few
to go around.

834
00:51:14,338 --> 00:51:16,397
Yeah, yeah. I get it, Dad.

835
00:51:19,777 --> 00:51:22,940
Okay. So, how was the food
at Lava Springs?

836
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:25,071
Insanely good.

837
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:28,985
- Take it out for a spin.
- No way.

838
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:32,522
Well, you didn't think I was going
to drive this heap, did you?

839
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:35,421
Yes! Yes!

840
00:51:35,793 --> 00:51:38,819
Okay, bring those knees up as high
as you can and circle those arms.

841
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:42,296
Hey, water bug. Last night was so fun.

842
00:51:42,366 --> 00:51:43,628
I really didn't mean
to get you in trouble.

843
00:51:43,701 --> 00:51:45,259
Same here.

844
00:51:45,336 --> 00:51:48,305
- So, maybe today we can have our...
- Troy?

845
00:51:50,975 --> 00:51:52,806
What time is your lunch break?

846
00:51:52,877 --> 00:51:53,935
Troy!

847
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:57,647
- 1:30.
- 1:30, great.

848
00:51:57,715 --> 00:52:01,446
Free cheeseburgers are on me.
Everybody looks great. Awesome job.

849
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:03,679
Okay, now, some jumping jacks.

850
00:52:04,822 --> 00:52:06,722
Hey. What is she up to?

851
00:52:07,992 --> 00:52:10,825
- Who knows?
- Believe me, she does.

852
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:16,526
I'm sorry I'm late, Mr. Fulton,

853
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:19,501
but about the pool thing last night,
you can't blame Gabriella...

854
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:21,504
- I'm promoting you.
- You're what?

855
00:52:21,572 --> 00:52:24,063
There's an opening
as an assistant to the golf pros.

856
00:52:24,174 --> 00:52:26,369
Salaried job, no clocking in.

857
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:29,913
- But, I...
- $500 a week, plus tips.

858
00:52:30,581 --> 00:52:32,640
What? Per week?

859
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:38,049
Oh, my... That's off the hook!
I think it sounds very manageable.

860
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:40,556
Shall we?

861
00:52:44,695 --> 00:52:45,923
Bolton!

862
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:52,795
- Wait. So you want me to teach golf?
- To kids. Oh, the joy.

863
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:56,865
- But, sir, I don't think I'm qualified.
- Worry not.

864
00:52:56,941 --> 00:52:59,842
Simply show the little angels
which end of the club to hold,

865
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,105
tee the ball up, then duck.

866
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:06,706
In addition, the board is extending
membership privileges to you.

867
00:53:06,784 --> 00:53:10,515
You have complete use
of club facilities, but do so prudently,

868
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:13,920
meaning, fellow Wildcats? Not.

869
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:18,252
Congratulations.

870
00:53:19,063 --> 00:53:21,930
You'll find an appropriate choice
of clothing here.

871
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,398
Do not mix checks with plaids,
blue with browns,

872
00:53:24,468 --> 00:53:27,460
and avoid wearing white socks
at all cost.

873
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:28,970
Leave your shoes outside the locker,

874
00:53:29,073 --> 00:53:32,099
they will be buffed and polished
each evening.

875
00:53:33,077 --> 00:53:35,773
Yes! Oh, man!

876
00:53:36,747 --> 00:53:38,214
Save it for the first tee.

877
00:53:38,282 --> 00:53:42,912
And to get there,
this might come in handy.

878
00:53:42,987 --> 00:53:47,720
That's the key to your golf cart.
Number 14.

879
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:52,285
The same number that's on your
basketball uniform, so I'm told.

880
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:53,761
Questions?

881
00:53:53,831 --> 00:53:55,628
How did this happen?

882
00:53:56,333 --> 00:54:01,066
It would seem that the Evans family
thinks you have untapped potential.

883
00:54:01,138 --> 00:54:06,405
Young man,
the future is full of uncharted waters,

884
00:54:06,477 --> 00:54:11,141
and this family has real clout,
so I suggest you take the ride.

885
00:54:15,486 --> 00:54:16,646
Yeah.

886
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:21,515
Italian.

887
00:54:21,792 --> 00:54:24,727
Awesome, junior golfers!
You guys look amazing!

888
00:54:26,397 --> 00:54:28,991
Hey! Hey! Slow down, champ.
Slow down.

889
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:31,794
Save some for the other kids.
There you go.

890
00:54:31,869 --> 00:54:33,962
Cool shorts, buddy.

891
00:54:34,038 --> 00:54:38,168
All right. Hey. Hey, cutie.
Try holding the club that way,

892
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,505
you're going to hit it way farther.

893
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:44,638
All right. Nice backswing, man.
Nice backswing.

894
00:54:44,715 --> 00:54:47,377
Good job, killer. Make the ball fear you.

895
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:50,351
You look good. Great job, everybody.
Good job, guys!

896
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:53,514
- Bolton. Bolton. Your 11:30 is here.
- Thanks, man.

897
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:55,182
Good luck, buddy.

898
00:54:58,662 --> 00:54:59,856
Troy!

899
00:55:00,364 --> 00:55:01,888
Oh, man.

900
00:55:04,922 --> 00:55:06,549
- Cool balls.
- Thanks.

901
00:55:06,624 --> 00:55:07,750
You're welcome.

902
00:55:07,859 --> 00:55:10,020
By the end of summer,
you'll have me playing like a pro.

903
00:55:10,094 --> 00:55:11,220
Yeah.

904
00:55:12,763 --> 00:55:15,061
If I live that long.

905
00:55:18,469 --> 00:55:20,300
I'm so excited about the show.

906
00:55:20,404 --> 00:55:23,601
Oh, and don't worry.
We'll find something great to do.

907
00:55:23,708 --> 00:55:28,645
Look, Sharpay, I already told you,
singing really isn't my thing.

908
00:55:28,746 --> 00:55:31,544
And here's the best news,
all the Redhawk boosters will be there.

909
00:55:31,616 --> 00:55:33,607
- Really?
- Of course.

910
00:55:33,718 --> 00:55:38,121
We'll lock up your scholarship
with a high "C" right from center stage.

911
00:55:39,891 --> 00:55:41,119
We're all in this together, right?

912
00:55:41,225 --> 00:55:43,819
Your parents have been really,
really nice, Sharpay,

913
00:55:43,928 --> 00:55:46,260
but singing with you
isn't a part of my job.

914
00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:50,130
I know,
just something you promised to do.

915
00:55:50,234 --> 00:55:51,565
Remember?

916
00:55:53,971 --> 00:55:56,439
You look fabulous in your new clothes,
by the way.

917
00:55:56,507 --> 00:56:00,637
- You like the shoes? They're Italian.
- Nice.

918
00:56:03,814 --> 00:56:06,078
Let me show you how this is done.
It's really easy.

919
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:10,416
Just line up to your target.
Nice, easy backswing.

920
00:56:11,155 --> 00:56:12,782
- Hey, Gab.
- Hey!

921
00:56:18,329 --> 00:56:22,425
That girl's got more moves than
an octopus in a wrestling match.

922
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:25,799
- Nah. He knows how to swim.
- Yeah. Troy can handle himself.

923
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:27,997
I did overhear him asking her
for her opinion

924
00:56:28,105 --> 00:56:31,768
on his new Italian golf shoes.

925
00:56:31,842 --> 00:56:33,104
He didn't ask me.

926
00:56:33,177 --> 00:56:36,669
So, wake up, sister! She's basically
offering him a college education

927
00:56:36,781 --> 00:56:38,942
just to sing with her in the talent show.

928
00:56:39,016 --> 00:56:43,282
- Troy would never do that.
- You got eyes, use them.

929
00:56:43,354 --> 00:56:47,017
- Let's go eat.
- Yeah, I got to go. Hey, see you later?

930
00:56:47,124 --> 00:56:48,614
- Okay.
- Okay.

931
00:56:48,693 --> 00:56:50,786
You're going to take it back
and through.

932
00:56:50,895 --> 00:56:55,195
- Troy, Fulton wants you in the lobby.
- Fantastic. Thank you. See you.

933
00:57:06,077 --> 00:57:08,739
And she steps on the ball.

934
00:57:10,214 --> 00:57:13,308
- Troy Bolton. This is...
- I've seen them all play at U of A.

935
00:57:13,384 --> 00:57:15,545
Oh, all right.
Well, come scrimmage at our gym.

936
00:57:15,653 --> 00:57:17,678
It'll be good for your game.

937
00:57:17,755 --> 00:57:20,747
- Play with you guys?
- Yeah. Let's get down, bro.

938
00:57:21,892 --> 00:57:23,553
- Awesome.
- All right.

939
00:57:23,661 --> 00:57:26,323
- Let's all get some awesome lunch.
- Yeah.

940
00:57:26,397 --> 00:57:28,422
I knew it! Coral blue!

941
00:57:28,532 --> 00:57:31,399
It's perfect for your skin tone.
And mine, too!

942
00:57:31,502 --> 00:57:33,561
We are majorly skin-tone compatible,
Troy.

943
00:57:33,671 --> 00:57:37,903
- I have no idea what that means.
- You don't need to. I'm here for you.

944
00:57:39,377 --> 00:57:40,674
- Who's hungry?
- Let's eat.

945
00:57:41,379 --> 00:57:44,109
I mean, how can you hit the ball
straight if your clubs don't trust you?

946
00:57:44,215 --> 00:57:46,206
- That's the key. So, it's all in the grip.
- Okay.

947
00:57:46,284 --> 00:57:49,378
You got to hold it just right.
That looks great.

948
00:57:49,453 --> 00:57:51,580
Hey, I almost forgot.

949
00:57:51,689 --> 00:57:53,088
I ordered Swiss on my burger.

950
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:55,454
So, go ahead and check it out, man.
Try it. See what you think.

951
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:58,426
Danforth, table three
needs more iced tea.

952
00:57:58,529 --> 00:58:00,224
Now, rotate your hands over the top.

953
00:58:00,298 --> 00:58:01,697
- Put your thumb on that side.
- Okay.

954
00:58:01,766 --> 00:58:04,234
There you go, man. You're good.
I'll see you on the course.

955
00:58:04,302 --> 00:58:05,894
- Yeah. Let's do it, man.
- Yeah.

956
00:58:06,737 --> 00:58:09,934
- Zeke! Troy wants Swiss.
- Coming right up.

957
00:58:10,041 --> 00:58:11,133
You know, you were right.

958
00:58:11,242 --> 00:58:12,971
There's a guy out there
that looks just like Troy Bolton,

959
00:58:13,077 --> 00:58:15,602
but I have no idea who he really is.

960
00:58:25,289 --> 00:58:27,416
Oh, hey.
Kelsi's got some great new ideas

961
00:58:27,491 --> 00:58:29,220
- to spice up the talent show. It's got...
- I'm thrilled.

962
00:58:29,293 --> 00:58:32,751
That new duet
that Troy and Gabriella sang? I need it.

963
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:35,298
- Actually, it's not available.
- Repeat.

964
00:58:35,399 --> 00:58:37,731
Well, it's something I wrote
for Troy and Gabriella,

965
00:58:37,802 --> 00:58:38,826
just in case they decide to...

966
00:58:38,936 --> 00:58:43,896
You're an employee,
not a fairy godmother. Let's have it.

967
00:58:45,609 --> 00:58:49,739
Transpose it into my key. Troy and I
will be doing it in the talent show.

968
00:58:49,814 --> 00:58:52,806
Oh, and brighten up the tempo.
We'll need to keep people awake.

969
00:58:52,917 --> 00:58:53,975
What about our song?

970
00:58:54,085 --> 00:58:56,986
- What about Humu Humu?
- Change in plans.

971
00:58:57,088 --> 00:58:59,818
What am I supposed to do
with my Tiki Warrior outfit?

972
00:58:59,924 --> 00:59:03,325
Save it for Halloween, go to a luau,
sell it online. I don't know!

973
00:59:03,427 --> 00:59:06,624
But in the meantime,
keep an eye on those Wildcats.

974
00:59:06,697 --> 00:59:08,426
If they're planning on
being in the show,

975
00:59:08,499 --> 00:59:10,967
which I doubt,
once they hear about Troy and me,

976
00:59:11,102 --> 00:59:14,469
I don't want any surprises.
Oh, and don't worry,

977
00:59:14,538 --> 00:59:17,803
I'll find a song for you
somewhere in the show.

978
00:59:17,875 --> 00:59:20,105
- Or the next show.
- Really?

979
00:59:22,012 --> 00:59:23,946
Don't strain yourself, slick.

980
00:59:27,151 --> 00:59:31,485
Entertainers are so temperamental.
Transpose!

981
00:59:42,533 --> 00:59:45,001
Look at you.

982
00:59:45,069 --> 00:59:47,970
- Go, team.
- Yeah. It's a gift from the guys.

983
00:59:49,907 --> 00:59:53,968
The "guys"?
Oh, you mean all those tall people?

984
00:59:54,044 --> 00:59:58,174
Yeah. Yeah.
Hey, look. I got to go in a minute,

985
00:59:58,249 --> 01:00:00,877
but I'll be back in about an hour.
I'll pick you up in my new truck

986
01:00:00,985 --> 01:00:03,385
and we'll go to a movie. I promise.

987
01:00:04,488 --> 01:00:07,218
"Promise" is a really big word, Troy.

988
01:00:08,592 --> 01:00:10,082
Yeah. I know.

989
01:00:10,194 --> 01:00:12,822
And we've got
the staff baseball game after work.

990
01:00:12,897 --> 01:00:14,660
Remember, you "promised"
that you'd play?

991
01:00:14,732 --> 01:00:17,997
Right. Right. Baseball.
I will absolutely meet you there.

992
01:00:18,068 --> 01:00:21,367
- You forgot, didn't you?
- No. I just got the date mixed up.

993
01:00:21,439 --> 01:00:24,408
And I'm sorry
I couldn't make lunch today. I just...

994
01:00:24,508 --> 01:00:26,908
It's been wild, you know?

995
01:00:27,011 --> 01:00:29,206
I can't believe
how things are working out here.

996
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:34,741
So I see. Italian golf shoes,
new clothes, golf carts.

997
01:00:34,852 --> 01:00:38,879
That's crazy stuff.
Hard to keep track of it all, I bet.

998
01:00:39,123 --> 01:00:40,249
So, what's your point?

999
01:00:40,357 --> 01:00:45,693
It just doesn't seem like new stuff,
it seems like a new Troy.

1000
01:00:47,264 --> 01:00:49,232
Let's see if Tiger Woods
still has a jump shot.

1001
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:52,201
- Hey, hey, Bolton! Come on!
- Hey!

1002
01:00:52,269 --> 01:00:53,861
Why don't you tell them
to come over here and mix it up?

1003
01:00:53,938 --> 01:00:55,064
We'll show them some game.

1004
01:00:55,139 --> 01:00:57,266
You know,
I don't think that's how they roll.

1005
01:00:57,374 --> 01:00:58,568
That's not how they "roll"?

1006
01:00:58,642 --> 01:01:02,578
No, no, no, that's not what I meant.
I just think it's a closed practice. Sorry.

1007
01:01:02,646 --> 01:01:04,705
Wow. Well,
maybe you can get us a video?

1008
01:01:04,782 --> 01:01:06,044
Bolton, come on!

1009
01:01:06,116 --> 01:01:08,414
But yesterday you said we were
going to play two-on-two after work,

1010
01:01:08,486 --> 01:01:12,252
- before the baseball game.
- I know. I know, man. I'm sorry.

1011
01:01:13,123 --> 01:01:17,719
Come on, Zeke, that was so yesterday.
You know, when we were all on a team!

1012
01:01:17,995 --> 01:01:19,724
- Hey, man.
- Hey, how's it going?

1013
01:01:19,897 --> 01:01:22,559
Hey, Bolton! That's my ball.

1014
01:01:28,806 --> 01:01:30,603
- Here we go!
- How's it going, guys?

1015
01:01:30,674 --> 01:01:32,335
Would you guys be mad at me
if I ask him to get me

1016
01:01:32,443 --> 01:01:34,877
one of those cool Redhawk jackets?

1017
01:01:37,815 --> 01:01:39,305
Hey. Come on.

1018
01:01:45,356 --> 01:01:48,154
I'm so excited about the game.
It's going to be so cool.

1019
01:01:48,225 --> 01:01:51,285
Hey, Ryan. No rehearsals?

1020
01:01:51,362 --> 01:01:54,331
My sister is working up something new.

1021
01:01:54,398 --> 01:01:56,992
So, you coming to the baseball game?

1022
01:01:57,067 --> 01:01:59,695
I'm not staff. Wasn't invited.

1023
01:01:59,803 --> 01:02:02,897
Hey, everyone's invited.
Come on. Hop in.

1024
01:02:04,508 --> 01:02:05,975
All right.

1025
01:02:07,311 --> 01:02:08,573
Hold on!

1026
01:02:11,515 --> 01:02:13,506
All right! Right here!

1027
01:02:19,356 --> 01:02:20,721
Beep, beep!

1028
01:02:23,861 --> 01:02:24,987
Beep, beep!

1029
01:02:26,564 --> 01:02:28,691
What, did Fulton send you out here
to spy on us?

1030
01:02:28,766 --> 01:02:29,994
Nah, my sister did.

1031
01:02:30,067 --> 01:02:32,001
She thinks you guys are going to
upstage her talent show.

1032
01:02:32,069 --> 01:02:34,196
Oh, no worries.
We were going to do the show,

1033
01:02:34,271 --> 01:02:36,705
but then Troy bailed on us,
so, whatever.

1034
01:02:36,774 --> 01:02:39,834
What do you mean "whatever"?
It's our summer, remember?

1035
01:02:39,910 --> 01:02:42,037
I thought we decided
doing the show would be fun.

1036
01:02:42,112 --> 01:02:43,579
- Well, I think so.
- Me, too.

1037
01:02:43,681 --> 01:02:45,546
- Who are we kidding?
- I don't think so.

1038
01:02:45,616 --> 01:02:47,083
We don't know
how to put together a show.

1039
01:02:47,184 --> 01:02:49,675
No, but he does.

1040
01:02:49,753 --> 01:02:52,950
If we have a real director
putting it together, it could be great.

1041
01:02:54,758 --> 01:02:57,727
Have the employees ever won
a Star Dazzle Award?

1042
01:02:57,962 --> 01:03:00,192
- Hey, now...
- I know what you can do, Ryan,

1043
01:03:00,264 --> 01:03:02,232
- so why not do it for us?
- All right, look,

1044
01:03:02,299 --> 01:03:07,396
if you want to play ball,
then grab a mitt, but I don't dance.

1045
01:03:07,471 --> 01:03:10,736
You don't think dancing
takes some game?

1046
01:03:13,911 --> 01:03:17,039
- You got game?
- A little.

1047
01:03:27,591 --> 01:03:29,286
Yes!

1048
01:03:34,465 --> 01:03:36,399
Hey, pitcher. Ball.

1049
01:03:38,669 --> 01:03:40,660
All right! Let's hustle!
Come on! Wildcats!

1050
01:03:40,771 --> 01:03:43,331
Get your head in the game!

1051
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:46,341
Hey! Oh! Play ball

1052
01:03:49,113 --> 01:03:51,013
Hey, hey!

1053
01:03:51,115 --> 01:03:53,845
Hey, batter batter, hey, batter batter
Swing

1054
01:03:53,951 --> 01:03:55,816
I've got to just do my thing

1055
01:03:55,919 --> 01:03:58,649
Hey, batter batter, hey, batter batter
Swing

1056
01:03:58,756 --> 01:04:00,519
Yeah

1057
01:04:00,624 --> 01:04:04,685
I'll show you that it's one and the same
Baseball, dancing, same game

1058
01:04:04,795 --> 01:04:09,596
It's easy
Step up to the plate, start swinging

1059
01:04:09,667 --> 01:04:11,430
I want to play ball now and that's all

1060
01:04:11,502 --> 01:04:15,802
This is what I do
It ain't no dance that you can show me

1061
01:04:15,873 --> 01:04:17,135
Hey, hey, hey

1062
01:04:17,207 --> 01:04:19,300
- Yeah
- You'll never know

1063
01:04:19,376 --> 01:04:21,674
- Oh, I know
- If you never try

1064
01:04:21,779 --> 01:04:26,375
There's just one little thing
that stops me every time

1065
01:04:26,483 --> 01:04:28,678
- Yeah
- Come on!

1066
01:04:28,786 --> 01:04:30,777
- I don't dance
- I know you can

1067
01:04:30,854 --> 01:04:32,481
- Not a chance
- No

1068
01:04:32,556 --> 01:04:36,549
- If I can do this, well, you can do that
- But I don't dance

1069
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:38,855
- Hit it out of the park
- I don't dance

1070
01:04:38,962 --> 01:04:41,192
- I say you can
- There's not a chance

1071
01:04:41,298 --> 01:04:43,061
- Oh
- Slide home, you score

1072
01:04:43,167 --> 01:04:44,225
Swinging on the dance floor

1073
01:04:44,334 --> 01:04:46,700
I don't dance, no

1074
01:04:46,804 --> 01:04:49,204
Hey, batter batter, hey, batter batter
Swing

1075
01:04:49,306 --> 01:04:51,137
I've got to just do my thing

1076
01:04:51,208 --> 01:04:53,369
Hey, batter batter, hey, batter batter
Swing

1077
01:04:53,477 --> 01:04:55,707
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1078
01:04:56,346 --> 01:05:00,180
Two stepping, now you're up to bat
Bases loaded, do your dance

1079
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:05,085
It's easy, take your best shot
Just hit it

1080
01:05:05,189 --> 01:05:07,157
I've got what it takes playing my game

1081
01:05:07,224 --> 01:05:11,217
So, you better spin that pitch
you're gonna throw me

1082
01:05:11,328 --> 01:05:13,057
- Yeah
- I'll show you how I swing

1083
01:05:13,130 --> 01:05:15,394
- You'll never know
- Oh, I know

1084
01:05:15,466 --> 01:05:16,933
If you never try

1085
01:05:17,034 --> 01:05:19,059
There's just one little thing

1086
01:05:19,136 --> 01:05:23,903
- That stops me every time
- Yeah, come on

1087
01:05:23,974 --> 01:05:26,238
- I don't dance
- I know you can

1088
01:05:26,310 --> 01:05:28,073
- Not a chance
- No, no

1089
01:05:28,145 --> 01:05:30,204
If I can do this
Well, you can do that

1090
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:33,272
- But I don't dance
- Hit it out of the park

1091
01:05:33,383 --> 01:05:35,408
- I don't dance
- I say you can

1092
01:05:35,486 --> 01:05:37,420
There's not a chance
Oh no

1093
01:05:37,488 --> 01:05:39,752
Slide home, you score
Swingin' on the dance floor

1094
01:05:39,823 --> 01:05:42,121
I don't dance no

1095
01:05:42,226 --> 01:05:44,285
Lean back, tuck it in, take a chance

1096
01:05:44,394 --> 01:05:46,794
Swing it out, spin around
do the dance

1097
01:05:46,897 --> 01:05:51,391
I wanna play ball not dance hall
I'm makin' a triple not a curtain call

1098
01:05:51,468 --> 01:05:53,265
I can prove it to you
till you know it's true

1099
01:05:53,337 --> 01:05:55,805
'Cause I can swing it
I can bring it to the diamond too

1100
01:05:55,906 --> 01:05:57,965
You're talkin' a lot
Show me what you got

1101
01:05:58,075 --> 01:06:01,943
Stop
Swing

1102
01:06:02,012 --> 01:06:04,606
Hey
Swing it like this

1103
01:06:04,681 --> 01:06:07,912
Yeah oh

1104
01:06:07,985 --> 01:06:09,976
- Swing
- Come on

1105
01:06:11,488 --> 01:06:14,423
- Jitterbug
- Just like that oh

1106
01:06:14,491 --> 01:06:16,618
That's what I mean
That's how you swing

1107
01:06:16,693 --> 01:06:18,923
You make a good pitch
but I don't believe

1108
01:06:18,996 --> 01:06:21,260
- I say you can
- I know I can't

1109
01:06:21,331 --> 01:06:25,631
I don't dance

1110
01:06:34,344 --> 01:06:35,834
You can do it

1111
01:06:38,182 --> 01:06:41,174
I don't dance, no

1112
01:06:41,285 --> 01:06:44,345
Nothin' to it
Atta boy, Atta boy, yeah

1113
01:06:44,454 --> 01:06:46,547
Hey, batter batter, hey, batter batter
What

1114
01:06:46,657 --> 01:06:49,649
One, two, three, four
Everybody, swing, come on

1115
01:06:49,726 --> 01:06:51,853
- I don't dance
- I know you can

1116
01:06:51,962 --> 01:06:53,691
Not a chance
No, no

1117
01:06:53,797 --> 01:06:55,788
If I can do this
Well, you can do that

1118
01:06:55,866 --> 01:06:57,527
But I don't dance

1119
01:06:57,634 --> 01:06:58,965
Hit it out of the park

1120
01:06:59,036 --> 01:07:01,004
- I don't dance
- I say you can

1121
01:07:01,071 --> 01:07:02,902
There's not a chance
No, no

1122
01:07:03,006 --> 01:07:04,997
If I can do this
Well, you can do that

1123
01:07:05,075 --> 01:07:06,702
But I don't dance

1124
01:07:06,810 --> 01:07:08,004
Hit it out of the park

1125
01:07:08,078 --> 01:07:10,171
- I don't dance
- I know you can

1126
01:07:10,247 --> 01:07:12,147
Not a chance
No, no

1127
01:07:12,216 --> 01:07:14,207
If I can do this
Well, you can do that

1128
01:07:14,318 --> 01:07:15,979
But I don't dance

1129
01:07:16,053 --> 01:07:17,145
Hit it out of the park

1130
01:07:17,221 --> 01:07:19,348
- I don't dance
- I say you can

1131
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:21,414
- There's not a chance
- Oh

1132
01:07:21,525 --> 01:07:23,823
Slide home, you score
Swinging on the dance floor

1133
01:07:23,894 --> 01:07:28,524
I don't dance, no

1134
01:07:30,434 --> 01:07:31,560
Safe!

1135
01:07:39,509 --> 01:07:40,601
That's it!

1136
01:07:43,747 --> 01:07:45,078
It's okay!

1137
01:07:46,516 --> 01:07:48,108
Hey, Evans.

1138
01:07:49,586 --> 01:07:52,384
I'm not saying
I'm going to dance in the show,

1139
01:07:52,456 --> 01:07:56,119
but if I did,
what would you have me do?

1140
01:08:05,769 --> 01:08:07,464
Hey! Get back, get back!

1141
01:08:07,571 --> 01:08:10,039
Here we go, here we go!
Defense, hold him tight!

1142
01:08:21,218 --> 01:08:22,310
Oh, dang!

1143
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:25,119
This kid's good. I like what I'm seeing.

1144
01:08:25,222 --> 01:08:28,555
Troy gives 110, 24l7,
that you can count on.

1145
01:08:28,825 --> 01:08:29,951
Here we go!

1146
01:08:30,761 --> 01:08:32,786
- Game. Game.
- Good game!

1147
01:08:38,936 --> 01:08:40,164
Was I right?

1148
01:08:40,270 --> 01:08:41,396
Great.

1149
01:08:48,145 --> 01:08:51,137
All right,
so you call that a "little" game?

1150
01:08:51,248 --> 01:08:56,550
Little League. World Series.
Newport, Rhode Island.

1151
01:08:58,055 --> 01:08:59,181
Champions.

1152
01:09:00,223 --> 01:09:02,555
- Good job!
- Nice hat.

1153
01:09:02,659 --> 01:09:05,059
- You're so awesome.
- Hey.

1154
01:09:05,162 --> 01:09:06,220
What can I say?

1155
01:09:08,231 --> 01:09:09,664
- Troy, you ready to run it back?
- Let's run it, man.

1156
01:09:09,733 --> 01:09:11,064
- All right. Let's go, yo.
- Let's go.

1157
01:09:11,168 --> 01:09:13,796
Let's go, yo, let's go. Let's run it back.

1158
01:09:20,877 --> 01:09:24,506
- Looking good.
- Wow, Wildcat!

1159
01:09:24,815 --> 01:09:28,842
- Too much?
- Only in daylight.

1160
01:09:28,919 --> 01:09:32,082
- Yeah.
- East High colors, very impressive.

1161
01:09:32,189 --> 01:09:35,556
- Hey. Be true to your school, right?
- Absolutely.

1162
01:09:35,659 --> 01:09:37,593
Everyone's excited
about doing the show.

1163
01:09:37,694 --> 01:09:40,424
Hey, I know everyone thinks
that I'm Sharpay's poodle,

1164
01:09:40,530 --> 01:09:42,521
- but I really think that I could...
- Hey.

1165
01:09:42,599 --> 01:09:46,535
If they were thinking that,
they're not thinking that today.

1166
01:09:47,070 --> 01:09:48,935
How do you do that swing-step
you did last night?

1167
01:09:49,039 --> 01:09:50,438
That's easy.

1168
01:09:52,743 --> 01:09:53,835
Hey.

1169
01:09:54,878 --> 01:09:56,778
- Hey.
- Hey.

1170
01:09:58,081 --> 01:10:02,177
So, I called last night.
I got hung up at the gym.

1171
01:10:04,354 --> 01:10:07,118
Hey, my dad says you're doing great
with those college guys.

1172
01:10:07,224 --> 01:10:09,192
Oh. Yeah. They're awesome.

1173
01:10:09,259 --> 01:10:11,056
Playing with them is like being
in another world.

1174
01:10:11,128 --> 01:10:14,291
Well, you missed out on a fun night.
It was a great game.

1175
01:10:16,933 --> 01:10:19,458
But the dessert afterwards
had to be the best part.

1176
01:10:19,569 --> 01:10:21,696
Her mom makes the best brownies

1177
01:10:21,772 --> 01:10:25,071
- in the entire world.
- Yeah, I know. I've had them.

1178
01:10:28,378 --> 01:10:30,642
Well, I'll see you guys later.

1179
01:10:46,229 --> 01:10:48,322
Hey, LeBron,
how'd it go with the Redhawks?

1180
01:10:48,432 --> 01:10:50,093
You know, they're very tall.

1181
01:10:50,167 --> 01:10:52,158
We got Vince from maintenance
to play, so it worked out.

1182
01:10:52,269 --> 01:10:54,931
- In case you were wondering.
- Maybe we could play later today.

1183
01:10:55,005 --> 01:10:56,563
I don't know. Check with Vince.

1184
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,938
Well, Mr. Evans set up the workout,
not me.

1185
01:10:59,009 --> 01:11:01,603
Did you even ask to include us,
Captain?

1186
01:11:01,678 --> 01:11:05,637
I didn't go looking for the Redhawks,
the Redhawks came to me. Okay?

1187
01:11:05,749 --> 01:11:09,742
I didn't sign up for this golf job,
Fulton offered it. I said yes.

1188
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:13,586
My decision. But I show up to work
same as you, so chill, man.

1189
01:11:13,657 --> 01:11:15,022
You get a speck of dirt on your pants,

1190
01:11:15,125 --> 01:11:17,423
- and someone dry cleans you.
- And you wouldn't do the same thing...

1191
01:11:17,494 --> 01:11:18,688
- If I was as good as you?
- I did not say that.

1192
01:11:18,795 --> 01:11:20,422
- You didn't have to!
- And neither did you!

1193
01:11:20,497 --> 01:11:23,330
You know what? We didn't vote you
captain because of your jump shot.

1194
01:11:23,433 --> 01:11:26,527
Okay, we did it because you're the guy
who usually knows what's up.

1195
01:11:26,636 --> 01:11:29,161
- But I guess things change.
- You think you got me all figured out?

1196
01:11:29,272 --> 01:11:31,365
Well, I don't think so.
And I don't answer to you.

1197
01:11:31,475 --> 01:11:34,672
Then maybe you should
start answering to yourself!

1198
01:11:34,778 --> 01:11:38,270
Look, we have been like brothers
since pre-school.

1199
01:11:38,348 --> 01:11:41,181
If I don't know who you are these days,
then who does?

1200
01:11:41,284 --> 01:11:46,950
Excuse me. You're all being paid
to work, not play Dr. Phil. Chop-chop.

1201
01:11:52,095 --> 01:11:54,029
Table settings, nice. Oh. No, no.

1202
01:11:55,345 --> 01:12:00,112
No. No. No. Now, that? Fabulous.

1203
01:12:00,183 --> 01:12:01,309
Troy!

1204
01:12:03,386 --> 01:12:06,219
Daddy will make certain the entire
scholarship committee is right here.

1205
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:07,687
Perfect view.

1206
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:09,382
I've already spoken to your mother.

1207
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:11,983
They're going to be sitting at a table
right next to ours.

1208
01:12:12,061 --> 01:12:13,722
It's going to be a fabulous evening.

1209
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:15,661
- Come on.
- Great.

1210
01:12:16,533 --> 01:12:17,795
Rehearsal, everyone!

1211
01:12:17,867 --> 01:12:19,459
- Taylor, I'm signing off on everything.
- Fabulous!

1212
01:12:19,769 --> 01:12:20,861
- Thank you, Mrs. Evans.
- Good job.

1213
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:24,701
Look, Sharpay. I know I promised
I'd do this, but just take it easy on me.

1214
01:12:24,807 --> 01:12:28,368
I'm kind of new
to the whole performing thing.

1215
01:12:28,478 --> 01:12:30,378
Five, six, seven, eight!

1216
01:12:35,018 --> 01:12:37,350
You are the music in

1217
01:12:41,758 --> 01:12:45,558
You are the music in
Are the music in

1218
01:12:45,628 --> 01:12:48,188
You know the words
"Once upon a time"

1219
01:12:48,264 --> 01:12:51,290
Makes you listen, there's a reason

1220
01:12:52,235 --> 01:12:54,965
And when you dream
there's a chance you'll find

1221
01:12:55,071 --> 01:12:58,905
A little laughter, or happy ever after

1222
01:12:58,975 --> 01:13:01,910
You're harmony to the melody

1223
01:13:01,978 --> 01:13:05,641
That's echoing inside my head

1224
01:13:05,748 --> 01:13:07,375
A single voice

1225
01:13:07,450 --> 01:13:08,940
Above the noise

1226
01:13:09,052 --> 01:13:12,886
Like a common thread
Sing it to me

1227
01:13:12,956 --> 01:13:16,949
When I hear my favorite song
I know we belong

1228
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:19,585
'Cause you are the music in me

1229
01:13:19,662 --> 01:13:22,062
It's living in all of us

1230
01:13:22,131 --> 01:13:26,568
It's here
Because you are the music in me

1231
01:13:30,807 --> 01:13:32,968
You are the music in

1232
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:41,482
You are the music in
Are the music in

1233
01:13:55,164 --> 01:13:57,962
Harmony to the melody

1234
01:13:58,034 --> 01:14:01,629
Echoing inside my head

1235
01:14:08,678 --> 01:14:12,705
When I hear my favorite song
I know we belong

1236
01:14:12,815 --> 01:14:15,545
'Cause you are the music in me

1237
01:14:15,652 --> 01:14:17,950
It's living in all of us

1238
01:14:18,021 --> 01:14:21,855
It's here
Because you are the music in

1239
01:14:22,025 --> 01:14:25,825
Me, me, me, me, me

1240
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:28,824
You are the music in

1241
01:14:33,503 --> 01:14:39,237
You are the music in me

1242
01:14:40,076 --> 01:14:42,510
Yeah, yeah

1243
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:47,143
Oh, yeah

1244
01:14:54,390 --> 01:14:56,824
Great job! One second.

1245
01:14:57,026 --> 01:14:58,391
Great rehearsal!

1246
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:00,086
Everybody break!

1247
01:15:02,365 --> 01:15:06,927
You know, Troy,
I've always known you were special.

1248
01:15:07,036 --> 01:15:10,267
And it's pretty obvious I'm special, too.

1249
01:15:10,373 --> 01:15:13,570
I think we were meant to sing together,
don't you?

1250
01:15:18,748 --> 01:15:20,375
I need some air.

1251
01:15:22,685 --> 01:15:25,586
Don't be long!
We're going to run it again!

1252
01:15:48,311 --> 01:15:49,938
Show me what you got!

1253
01:15:51,647 --> 01:15:53,877
Come on, everybody! Here we go!

1254
01:16:04,427 --> 01:16:07,157
You're up! You're up! You're up first!

1255
01:16:07,797 --> 01:16:10,459
Here we go! Give it to me!

1256
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:12,591
Come on! Oh, yeah!

1257
01:16:13,803 --> 01:16:16,795
You got it! Here we go!
Pass it to me!

1258
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:19,631
Come on, let's dance!

1259
01:16:20,943 --> 01:16:22,467
You're up! You're up!

1260
01:16:26,215 --> 01:16:27,876
Let's show them what we got!

1261
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,849
Come on! All right!

1262
01:16:36,959 --> 01:16:39,985
Oh, cut that! Get out of here!

1263
01:16:44,667 --> 01:16:47,568
- You got it! Hey.
- Good job!

1264
01:16:49,739 --> 01:16:51,331
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1265
01:16:57,146 --> 01:17:00,809
I said keep an eye on them,
not turn them into the cast of Grease!

1266
01:17:00,883 --> 01:17:02,510
Pretty cool, huh?

1267
01:17:03,853 --> 01:17:08,517
Do you want us to lose the Star Dazzle
Award to a bunch of dishwashers?

1268
01:17:09,859 --> 01:17:13,090
Us? Well, I guess that's showbiz.

1269
01:17:15,097 --> 01:17:19,033
When did you become one of them?

1270
01:17:20,837 --> 01:17:23,169
You know,
I'll take that as a compliment.

1271
01:17:23,372 --> 01:17:26,933
But you and Troy
have a good show, sis.

1272
01:17:27,076 --> 01:17:29,340
Oh, we plan to.

1273
01:17:40,590 --> 01:17:42,182
Give me a beat.

1274
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,459
The Midsummer's Night Talent Show
means something to me,

1275
01:17:53,569 --> 01:17:54,695
- and to my family.
- Well...

1276
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:57,034
Those Wildcats will turn it into a farce.

1277
01:17:57,106 --> 01:18:01,304
I'm... Your brother is one of
"those Wildcats," I'm told.

1278
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:04,243
Oh, don't you mention that traitor to us.

1279
01:18:04,313 --> 01:18:06,873
Employee involvement in the show
is a tradition here.

1280
01:18:06,949 --> 01:18:10,817
Traditions change. My parents have
important guests coming.

1281
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:14,219
We'll need every employee working
the party, and not on stage.

1282
01:18:14,290 --> 01:18:17,418
Pardon moi, but
we're not just talking about employees,

1283
01:18:17,493 --> 01:18:23,090
we're talking about your classmates.
You might want to think this one out.

1284
01:18:23,165 --> 01:18:24,962
All right.

1285
01:18:26,002 --> 01:18:28,436
Done. Now do it.

1286
01:18:34,911 --> 01:18:37,243
- Hi, Taylor.
- Hi.

1287
01:18:41,317 --> 01:18:45,811
Distribute these in the staff area,
but not until the end of shift.

1288
01:18:45,922 --> 01:18:50,291
- What? Wait! Mr. Fulton...
- No discussion, Miss McKessie.

1289
01:18:50,359 --> 01:18:54,762
This is a business.
Welcome to the world of adults

1290
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:58,857
who wish to keep their jobs because
they have mortgages they wish to pay,

1291
01:18:58,968 --> 01:19:02,199
tuition bills, car payments,
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1292
01:19:02,305 --> 01:19:05,172
So, sometimes, we have
to perform tasks, however unpleasant,

1293
01:19:05,274 --> 01:19:07,868
that are necessary
for that all-too-important paycheck

1294
01:19:07,977 --> 01:19:10,605
to land in our all-too-empty pockets!

1295
01:19:13,316 --> 01:19:18,151
- May I get you a cup of tea, Mr. Fulton?
- Chamomile would be lovely.

1296
01:19:23,225 --> 01:19:28,492
- Go, Martha! Go, Martha!
- Go, Martha! Go, Martha!

1297
01:19:28,564 --> 01:19:29,861
May I have your attention, please?

1298
01:19:29,966 --> 01:19:32,526
You guys,
I need to make an announcement.

1299
01:19:32,635 --> 01:19:36,230
All junior staffers will be required
to work on show night.

1300
01:19:36,339 --> 01:19:37,704
- What?
- Yeah, it says,

1301
01:19:37,807 --> 01:19:41,470
"No staff participation in the show
will be allowed. No exceptions."

1302
01:19:41,544 --> 01:19:44,172
- No show?
- There's a show. We're just not in it.

1303
01:19:44,246 --> 01:19:45,474
That's great.

1304
01:19:45,548 --> 01:19:48,574
I'm sorry, you guys. There's nothing
we can do about it. It's Fulton's orders.

1305
01:19:48,684 --> 01:19:50,845
There's no way this is Fulton's idea.

1306
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:55,357
Unless Fulton suddenly has blonde
hair and wears designer flip-flops.

1307
01:19:55,424 --> 01:19:56,823
Excuse me.

1308
01:20:07,236 --> 01:20:09,636
- Totally!
- Sharpay!

1309
01:20:15,478 --> 01:20:17,469
Forget about the rest of us,
how about the fact

1310
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:20,048
that your brother has worked
extremely hard on this show?

1311
01:20:20,116 --> 01:20:24,985
Oh, boo-hoo. He'll be in the show.
He'll do his celebrity impersonations.

1312
01:20:25,087 --> 01:20:27,647
And don't lecture me about Ryan,

1313
01:20:27,757 --> 01:20:29,782
given the way you've been interfering
with Troy's future.

1314
01:20:29,892 --> 01:20:30,950
What?

1315
01:20:31,293 --> 01:20:34,319
You've gotten him written up by Fulton
for sneaking on the golf course,

1316
01:20:34,430 --> 01:20:39,163
swimming after hours.
I had to step in just to save Troy's job.

1317
01:20:39,268 --> 01:20:41,896
I'm not interested in what you think
you're doing for Troy.

1318
01:20:41,971 --> 01:20:45,236
That's between you and him.
But you're messing with my friends,

1319
01:20:45,307 --> 01:20:48,435
my summer,
and that's not okay with me.

1320
01:20:48,511 --> 01:20:51,776
You don't like the fact that I won.

1321
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:55,647
What's the prize? Troy?
The Star Dazzle Award?

1322
01:20:55,751 --> 01:20:58,515
You have to go through all of this
just to get either one?

1323
01:20:58,621 --> 01:20:59,815
No, thanks, Sharpay.

1324
01:20:59,922 --> 01:21:02,652
You're very good at a game
that I don't want to play,

1325
01:21:02,758 --> 01:21:04,589
so I'm done here.

1326
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,589
But you better step away
from the mirror

1327
01:21:06,662 --> 01:21:10,928
long enough to check the damage
that will always be right behind you.

1328
01:21:16,205 --> 01:21:17,365
Girls!

1329
01:21:21,711 --> 01:21:24,771
Hey.
What do you mean you're done here?

1330
01:21:24,847 --> 01:21:26,610
I mean, you can't quit.

1331
01:21:26,682 --> 01:21:32,552
Us working together sounded good,
but plans change and people change.

1332
01:21:32,655 --> 01:21:34,953
The club talent show is a big deal
for Sharpay,

1333
01:21:35,024 --> 01:21:38,118
and evidently for your future,
so it's cool.

1334
01:21:38,194 --> 01:21:39,286
Just make it happen.

1335
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:42,797
- Wear your new Italian shoes.
- Hey, I'm still me.

1336
01:21:42,865 --> 01:21:44,958
Blowing off your friends,
missing dates?

1337
01:21:45,034 --> 01:21:46,865
- Lf that's you, it's good to know.
- No, no, no, no, no.

1338
01:21:46,969 --> 01:21:49,563
I was only doing that because
I'm working on the scholarship thing.

1339
01:21:49,672 --> 01:21:50,969
You know that.

1340
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:52,905
But if along the way
you act like someone you're not,

1341
01:21:53,008 --> 01:21:54,566
pretty soon that's who you become.

1342
01:21:54,677 --> 01:21:58,875
I meant what I said about movies
and summer and just being together.

1343
01:21:58,981 --> 01:22:01,449
I'm sure you did, at the time.

1344
01:22:03,152 --> 01:22:08,419
But I also meant what I said,
that I want to remember this summer.

1345
01:22:08,524 --> 01:22:10,515
But not like this, Troy.

1346
01:22:12,828 --> 01:22:17,822
I gotta say what's on my mind

1347
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:23,167
Something about us
doesn't seem right these days

1348
01:22:23,239 --> 01:22:27,699
Life keeps getting in the way

1349
01:22:27,777 --> 01:22:28,903
Whenever we try

1350
01:22:29,011 --> 01:22:33,675
Somehow the plan
is always rearranged

1351
01:22:33,749 --> 01:22:39,278
It's so hard to say
But I gotta do what's best for me

1352
01:22:39,388 --> 01:22:41,379
You'll be okay

1353
01:22:41,457 --> 01:22:46,224
I've got to move on and be who I am

1354
01:22:46,562 --> 01:22:51,966
I just don't belong here
I hope you understand

1355
01:22:52,067 --> 01:22:57,300
We might find a place
in this world someday

1356
01:22:57,406 --> 01:23:04,369
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way

1357
01:23:09,285 --> 01:23:14,120
Don't wanna leave it all behind

1358
01:23:14,223 --> 01:23:16,248
But I get my hopes up

1359
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:19,988
And I watch them fall every time

1360
01:23:20,095 --> 01:23:24,054
Another color turns to gray

1361
01:23:24,133 --> 01:23:30,436
And it's just too hard to watch it all
Slowly fade away

1362
01:23:30,506 --> 01:23:36,001
I'm leaving today
'Cause I gotta do what's best for me

1363
01:23:36,111 --> 01:23:38,170
You'll be okay

1364
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:42,979
I've got to move on and be who I am

1365
01:23:43,085 --> 01:23:48,682
I just don't belong here
I hope you understand

1366
01:23:48,791 --> 01:23:53,990
We might find our place
in this world someday

1367
01:23:54,063 --> 01:24:00,468
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way

1368
01:24:01,203 --> 01:24:02,966
What about us?

1369
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:06,405
What about everything
we've been through?

1370
01:24:06,508 --> 01:24:08,806
What about trust?

1371
01:24:08,878 --> 01:24:11,870
You know I never wanted to hurt you

1372
01:24:11,981 --> 01:24:14,211
What about me?

1373
01:24:14,316 --> 01:24:16,682
What am I supposed to do?

1374
01:24:16,752 --> 01:24:22,520
- I gotta leave, but I'll miss you
- I'll miss you

1375
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:26,760
Oh, so

1376
01:24:26,862 --> 01:24:30,764
I've got to move on and be who I am

1377
01:24:30,866 --> 01:24:31,992
Why do you have to go?

1378
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:36,197
I just don't belong here
I hope you understand

1379
01:24:36,272 --> 01:24:37,398
I'm trying to understand

1380
01:24:37,506 --> 01:24:42,569
We might find a place
in this world someday

1381
01:24:42,678 --> 01:24:46,614
- But at least for now
- I want you to stay

1382
01:24:46,715 --> 01:24:48,512
I gotta go my own way

1383
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:52,418
I've got to move on and be who I am

1384
01:24:52,521 --> 01:24:53,613
What about us?

1385
01:24:53,722 --> 01:24:57,624
I just don't belong here
I hope you understand

1386
01:24:57,726 --> 01:24:58,920
I'm trying to understand

1387
01:24:59,028 --> 01:25:04,261
We might find our place
in this world someday

1388
01:25:04,366 --> 01:25:10,896
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way

1389
01:25:13,475 --> 01:25:17,309
I gotta go my own way

1390
01:25:18,814 --> 01:25:22,910
I gotta go my own way

1391
01:25:39,969 --> 01:25:41,664
You're usually taking these
right off the grill.

1392
01:25:41,770 --> 01:25:43,067
Maybe I've been eating too much
at the club.

1393
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:45,299
You've barely been out of this room
the last three or four days.

1394
01:25:45,407 --> 01:25:48,843
- Let's call the guys, get a game going.
- They wouldn't come even if I called.

1395
01:25:48,944 --> 01:25:52,175
I find that hard to believe.

1396
01:25:52,281 --> 01:25:57,344
Dad, do I seem different
to you this summer?

1397
01:25:57,453 --> 01:25:59,318
You dress a lot better, that's for sure.

1398
01:25:59,421 --> 01:26:04,120
Oh, man, I'm serious.
Maybe my friends are right,

1399
01:26:04,193 --> 01:26:06,753
maybe I'm turning into a jerk
with new shoes.

1400
01:26:06,829 --> 01:26:09,593
New shoes, not a new kid.
Where's this coming from?

1401
01:26:09,665 --> 01:26:12,498
I've been so focused on my future.

1402
01:26:12,601 --> 01:26:16,196
I mean, Gabriella quit.
Chad won't talk to me.

1403
01:26:16,305 --> 01:26:17,932
I don't see the Wildcats
running around here.

1404
01:26:18,007 --> 01:26:19,599
Is this about going after
what you want?

1405
01:26:19,675 --> 01:26:22,940
Yeah, Dad.
The scholarship's important. I get it.

1406
01:26:23,012 --> 01:26:25,173
Hey, hey.

1407
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:28,215
Look, it's only a big deal
if it makes sense to you.

1408
01:26:28,317 --> 01:26:30,842
I don't even know who I am anymore.

1409
01:26:34,556 --> 01:26:37,116
You know what?

1410
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:41,185
I've known this kid for a long, long time.

1411
01:26:41,296 --> 01:26:46,290
And I got a lot of faith in him.
He looks a lot like you.

1412
01:26:47,569 --> 01:26:52,836
I'm absolutely sure he's going
to figure out the right thing to do.

1413
01:26:56,145 --> 01:26:58,477
It's so good. I cannot wait.

1414
01:27:03,752 --> 01:27:04,912
Yeah, I'm eating so much breakfast,

1415
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:07,853
I won't be able to eat my dinner
at night.

1416
01:27:08,023 --> 01:27:10,150
Oh, yeah. It's okay, Ryan's gonna help.

1417
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:13,023
- I don't know.
- We'll get it eventually.

1418
01:27:13,262 --> 01:27:14,354
Excuse me.

1419
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:48,493
Everybody's always talking at me

1420
01:27:48,597 --> 01:27:51,589
Everybody's trying to get in my head

1421
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,333
I wanna listen to my own heart talking

1422
01:27:55,437 --> 01:27:58,338
I need to count on myself instead

1423
01:27:58,607 --> 01:28:01,770
- Did you ever
- Lose yourself to get what you want?

1424
01:28:01,844 --> 01:28:05,177
- Did you ever
- Get on a ride then wanna get off?

1425
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:06,338
Did you ever

1426
01:28:06,448 --> 01:28:08,848
Push away the ones
you should've held close?

1427
01:28:08,951 --> 01:28:12,819
Did you ever let go?
Did you ever not know?

1428
01:28:12,921 --> 01:28:16,322
I'm not gonna stop, that's who I am

1429
01:28:16,425 --> 01:28:19,792
I'll give it all I got, that is my plan

1430
01:28:19,862 --> 01:28:23,263
Will I find what I lost?
You know you can

1431
01:28:23,365 --> 01:28:26,459
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it

1432
01:28:26,535 --> 01:28:27,661
Bet on me

1433
01:28:27,769 --> 01:28:30,465
I wanna make it right, that is the way

1434
01:28:30,539 --> 01:28:33,940
To turn my life around
Today is the day

1435
01:28:34,009 --> 01:28:37,342
Am I the type of guy
who means what I say?

1436
01:28:37,446 --> 01:28:41,041
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it

1437
01:28:41,150 --> 01:28:44,551
How will I know
if there's a path worth taking?

1438
01:28:44,653 --> 01:28:48,054
Should I question every move I make?

1439
01:28:48,157 --> 01:28:51,558
With all I've lost, my heart is breaking

1440
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:54,527
I don't want to make
the same mistakes

1441
01:28:54,630 --> 01:28:55,722
Did you ever

1442
01:28:55,831 --> 01:28:57,992
Doubt your dream will ever come true?

1443
01:28:58,066 --> 01:28:59,158
Did you ever

1444
01:28:59,234 --> 01:29:01,566
Blame the world but never blame you?

1445
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:04,901
- I will never
- Try to live a lie again

1446
01:29:05,007 --> 01:29:08,909
I don't wanna win this game
if I can't play it my way

1447
01:29:09,011 --> 01:29:12,674
I'm not gonna stop, that's who I am

1448
01:29:12,748 --> 01:29:16,184
I'll give it all I got, that is my plan

1449
01:29:16,251 --> 01:29:19,345
Will I find what I lost?
You know you can

1450
01:29:19,421 --> 01:29:22,982
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it

1451
01:29:23,058 --> 01:29:26,516
I wanna make it right, that is the way

1452
01:29:26,595 --> 01:29:29,996
To turn my life around
Today is the day

1453
01:29:30,065 --> 01:29:33,501
Am I the type of guy
who means what I say?

1454
01:29:33,569 --> 01:29:36,936
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it

1455
01:29:37,039 --> 01:29:40,531
Oh, hold up

1456
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:44,338
Gimme room to think
Bring it on down

1457
01:29:47,115 --> 01:29:51,051
Gotta work on my swing
Gotta do my own thing

1458
01:29:52,354 --> 01:29:53,685
Hold up

1459
01:29:58,794 --> 01:30:02,855
It's no good at all to see yourself

1460
01:30:02,931 --> 01:30:05,866
And not recognize your face

1461
01:30:05,934 --> 01:30:11,133
Out on my own
It's such a scary place

1462
01:30:12,741 --> 01:30:17,974
The answers are all inside of me

1463
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:24,952
All I got to do is believe

1464
01:30:26,121 --> 01:30:29,579
I'm not gonna stop, not gonna stop
till I get my shot

1465
01:30:29,658 --> 01:30:32,923
That's who I am, that is my plan
We'll end up on top

1466
01:30:32,995 --> 01:30:35,896
You can bet on it, bet on it
bet on it, bet on

1467
01:30:35,964 --> 01:30:40,401
You can bet on it, bet on it, bet on it
Bet on me

1468
01:30:40,469 --> 01:30:43,597
I wanna make it right, that is the way

1469
01:30:43,672 --> 01:30:47,164
To turn my life around
Today is the day

1470
01:30:47,276 --> 01:30:50,643
Am I the type of guy
who means what I say?

1471
01:30:50,746 --> 01:30:54,842
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it
You can bet on me

1472
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:02,514
This way.

1473
01:31:08,930 --> 01:31:10,192
What do you mean
you're not doing the show?

1474
01:31:10,299 --> 01:31:12,597
- Exactly that.
- We're singing a duet, Troy!

1475
01:31:12,668 --> 01:31:14,431
A duet means two people.

1476
01:31:14,503 --> 01:31:16,437
Well, mostly me in this case,
but whatever! Duet!

1477
01:31:16,505 --> 01:31:19,201
I'm an employee.
Employees aren't allowed in the show.

1478
01:31:19,308 --> 01:31:21,799
No, no, no, no. No, no.
You're an honorary member.

1479
01:31:21,877 --> 01:31:23,071
Not anymore.

1480
01:31:23,178 --> 01:31:25,305
- I asked Fulton for my kitchen job back.
- What?

1481
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:28,816
Sharpay, I don't like the way
you've been treating my friends.

1482
01:31:28,884 --> 01:31:30,715
And I don't like the way
I've been treating them either,

1483
01:31:30,819 --> 01:31:32,844
so I'm doing something about it.

1484
01:31:32,921 --> 01:31:37,585
An entire table of University boosters
are coming to see you, thanks to me.

1485
01:31:37,693 --> 01:31:39,718
So, I'll be their waiter.
They'll be thrilled.

1486
01:31:39,828 --> 01:31:41,887
Troy, Troy. This could change your life!

1487
01:31:41,997 --> 01:31:44,932
I'm more interested in
about what my friends think of me,

1488
01:31:45,033 --> 01:31:46,591
and what I think of myself.

1489
01:31:46,702 --> 01:31:49,694
Oh, we could all hold hands
around the campfire some other time!

1490
01:31:49,771 --> 01:31:51,068
Right now we've got a show to do.

1491
01:31:51,173 --> 01:31:55,542
No. You've got a show to do.
I got a kitchen to clean.

1492
01:32:00,215 --> 01:32:01,546
It's okay.

1493
01:32:05,787 --> 01:32:07,687
Kelsi, find Ryan.

1494
01:32:10,192 --> 01:32:12,456
Welcome this evening.
You'll be seated at table 21.

1495
01:32:12,561 --> 01:32:16,258
Kelly, will you escort them, please?
Excellent.

1496
01:32:16,365 --> 01:32:17,423
Ladies, you look gorgeous

1497
01:32:17,532 --> 01:32:20,467
- this evening. Beautiful.
- And now, returning with

1498
01:32:20,569 --> 01:32:24,903
a abridged version
of last year's tap-dancing epic,

1499
01:32:24,973 --> 01:32:28,568
Tina and her Tippety-Tappity Toes!

1500
01:32:39,755 --> 01:32:41,882
There you are! Thank goodness
you've come to your senses.

1501
01:32:41,957 --> 01:32:43,788
Plug in the volcano.
Humu Humu is back on.

1502
01:32:43,892 --> 01:32:47,487
Enjoy your pineapple on your own, sis.
I'm not doing the show.

1503
01:32:47,596 --> 01:32:50,827
What? Oh, put some fresh batteries
in your Tiki Warrior costume

1504
01:32:50,932 --> 01:32:53,457
- and let's get going!
- Took your advice. Sold it online.

1505
01:32:53,568 --> 01:32:58,505
You've always wanted the spotlight.
Now you've got it. Break a leg.

1506
01:33:04,079 --> 01:33:06,946
The curtain's up. Showtime!

1507
01:33:19,194 --> 01:33:22,357
Kelsi told us what went down
between you and Sharpay.

1508
01:33:22,464 --> 01:33:26,195
I'm more interested in what went down
between me and you, man.

1509
01:33:26,301 --> 01:33:29,327
- I was a jerk.
- Yeah.

1510
01:33:29,438 --> 01:33:31,929
But, hey, brothers fight.

1511
01:33:32,007 --> 01:33:34,703
And they're still brothers.

1512
01:33:37,345 --> 01:33:38,505
All right!

1513
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:42,879
Guys, I messed up your show
and I'm sorry.

1514
01:33:42,984 --> 01:33:47,148
Yeah, because show business
is our entire lives, right?

1515
01:33:47,222 --> 01:33:50,020
Hey, I hope you haven't permanently
filled my spot in the two-on-two game.

1516
01:33:50,125 --> 01:33:53,288
And, Ryan, I know how hard
you must've worked on this show.

1517
01:33:53,361 --> 01:33:55,625
Making these Wildcats look good
couldn't have been easy.

1518
01:33:55,697 --> 01:33:58,996
- Hey.
- So, I apologize.

1519
01:33:59,067 --> 01:34:01,729
Hey, the truth is,
we've all had a lot of fun.

1520
01:34:01,837 --> 01:34:02,895
At least, I have.

1521
01:34:03,004 --> 01:34:07,168
Hey, you gotta see
this dude play baseball.

1522
01:34:07,242 --> 01:34:09,301
I'm looking forward to it.

1523
01:34:11,246 --> 01:34:12,804
- All right!
- Yeah!

1524
01:34:12,881 --> 01:34:15,873
Troy, listen, all these people out there,

1525
01:34:15,984 --> 01:34:19,147
I don't really want
to see my sister crash and burn.

1526
01:34:19,221 --> 01:34:23,419
At least, I think I don't.
I think you should sing with her.

1527
01:34:27,095 --> 01:34:31,828
My life is over. I've been a good girl.

1528
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:35,199
I've never lied, except when necessary.

1529
01:34:35,270 --> 01:34:37,738
I always bought my parents
expensive gifts,

1530
01:34:37,839 --> 01:34:41,741
using their credit card, of course.
But I don't deserve this humiliation!

1531
01:34:41,843 --> 01:34:46,212
You need to get out there.
Mrs. Hoffenfeffer and her sock puppet

1532
01:34:46,281 --> 01:34:49,512
are stinking up the premises.

1533
01:34:49,584 --> 01:34:52,109
Well, the only thing that
would make it any lovelier would be

1534
01:34:52,220 --> 01:34:56,884
that if I won that Star Dazzle Award!
Sharpay, I'm going to find you.

1535
01:34:56,958 --> 01:35:01,418
That award, I tell you, it's mine!
Mine! Mine!

1536
01:35:01,530 --> 01:35:06,433
Mirror, mirror on the wall. Who's the...
Oh, forget it.

1537
01:35:08,737 --> 01:35:12,002
How's your show going?

1538
01:35:12,107 --> 01:35:13,836
How's it going?

1539
01:35:13,942 --> 01:35:15,170
My show makes the captain
of the Titanic

1540
01:35:15,277 --> 01:35:17,677
look like he won the lottery.

1541
01:35:17,779 --> 01:35:21,306
- I'll sing with you, Sharpay.
- What?

1542
01:35:21,416 --> 01:35:24,647
I promised. And I keep my promises.

1543
01:35:24,753 --> 01:35:29,156
But what was the first thing you said
to me when I started working here?

1544
01:35:30,292 --> 01:35:34,092
- Bring me more iced tea?
- Think harder. We're...

1545
01:35:36,798 --> 01:35:40,859
- All in this together.
- Exactly.

1546
01:35:40,969 --> 01:35:43,870
Well, we are.

1547
01:35:43,972 --> 01:35:46,702
So, let's get out there
and knock them dead, Troy Bolton!

1548
01:35:46,808 --> 01:35:50,835
I do the show
if the Wildcats do the show.

1549
01:35:54,849 --> 01:35:56,817
And I'd think fast.

1550
01:35:56,885 --> 01:35:59,718
I just sort of wish
you were doing this for me.

1551
01:36:01,990 --> 01:36:03,981
You're a good guy, Troy.

1552
01:36:06,227 --> 01:36:11,164
And actually, right now, I think
I like you better than I like myself.

1553
01:36:11,232 --> 01:36:13,029
Did I just say that?

1554
01:36:18,073 --> 01:36:20,473
Girls! Places!

1555
01:36:40,261 --> 01:36:44,994
- Okay. Everyone. Ryan, the show's on.
- Where's the music? Where's Troy?

1556
01:36:45,066 --> 01:36:46,897
Talked to Sharpay, everything's cool.

1557
01:36:47,002 --> 01:36:51,166
Hey, speaking of my sister,
she wants you to learn a new song.

1558
01:36:51,239 --> 01:36:54,402
Everyday. I can't learn a new song!

1559
01:36:54,509 --> 01:36:57,410
- Kelsi will help you with it.
- What?

1560
01:36:57,512 --> 01:36:59,912
- It's showtime!
- Yeah!

1561
01:37:00,015 --> 01:37:01,573
- What team?
- Wildcats!

1562
01:37:01,683 --> 01:37:03,207
- What team?
- Wildcats!

1563
01:37:03,284 --> 01:37:05,081
- What team?
- Wildcats!

1564
01:37:15,897 --> 01:37:19,094
Once in a lifetime

1565
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:22,727
And now it's time for our five-time

1566
01:37:22,804 --> 01:37:26,069
Star Dazzle Award winner,
Miss Sharpay Evans,

1567
01:37:26,141 --> 01:37:31,443
singing this year with
our assistant golf pro, Mr. Troy Bolton.

1568
01:37:33,715 --> 01:37:35,774
Where is Troy?

1569
01:37:35,884 --> 01:37:39,820
- Hey. Why did you switch songs?
- Switch songs? What?

1570
01:37:39,921 --> 01:37:43,220
- Yeah, Ryan said...
- Bolton!

1571
01:37:43,291 --> 01:37:47,489
- But I didn't learn a new song.
- Exactly.

1572
01:37:52,901 --> 01:37:54,095
Girls!

1573
01:38:04,112 --> 01:38:07,980
Once in a lifetime

1574
01:38:08,083 --> 01:38:12,144
Means there's no second chance

1575
01:38:12,253 --> 01:38:16,451
So I believe that you and me

1576
01:38:16,524 --> 01:38:20,824
Should grab it while we can

1577
01:38:20,929 --> 01:38:24,626
Make it last forever

1578
01:38:24,699 --> 01:38:29,033
And never give it back

1579
01:38:29,137 --> 01:38:35,337
It's our turn
and I'm loving where we're at

1580
01:38:37,378 --> 01:38:43,806
Because this moment's really
all we have

1581
01:38:45,220 --> 01:38:49,384
Every day of our lives

1582
01:38:49,491 --> 01:38:53,518
Wanna find you there
Wanna hold on tight

1583
01:38:53,661 --> 01:38:55,492
Gonna run

1584
01:38:55,563 --> 01:39:01,832
While we're young
And keep the faith

1585
01:39:01,936 --> 01:39:03,904
Every day

1586
01:39:04,005 --> 01:39:06,166
From right now

1587
01:39:06,241 --> 01:39:10,200
Gonna use our voices
and scream out loud

1588
01:39:10,278 --> 01:39:12,269
Take my hand

1589
01:39:12,380 --> 01:39:16,282
Together we will celebrate

1590
01:39:16,384 --> 01:39:17,544
Celebrate

1591
01:39:17,619 --> 01:39:21,385
Oh, every day

1592
01:39:27,529 --> 01:39:31,590
They say that you should follow

1593
01:39:31,699 --> 01:39:35,226
And chase down what you dream

1594
01:39:35,303 --> 01:39:39,967
But if you get lost and lose yourself

1595
01:39:40,074 --> 01:39:42,599
What does it really mean?

1596
01:39:44,112 --> 01:39:46,774
No matter where we're going

1597
01:39:46,881 --> 01:39:51,909
Oh, yeah, it starts from where we are

1598
01:39:52,654 --> 01:39:54,121
There's more to life

1599
01:39:54,222 --> 01:40:00,252
When we listen to our hearts

1600
01:40:00,328 --> 01:40:07,166
And because of you
I've got the strength to start

1601
01:40:07,268 --> 01:40:08,895
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1602
01:40:08,970 --> 01:40:12,906
Every day of our lives

1603
01:40:12,974 --> 01:40:17,070
Wanna find you there
Wanna hold on tight

1604
01:40:17,145 --> 01:40:18,840
Gonna run

1605
01:40:18,947 --> 01:40:24,180
While we're young
And keep the faith

1606
01:40:24,586 --> 01:40:27,487
Oh, every day

1607
01:40:27,589 --> 01:40:29,614
From right now

1608
01:40:29,691 --> 01:40:33,821
Gonna use our voices
and scream out loud

1609
01:40:33,928 --> 01:40:35,919
Take my hand

1610
01:40:35,997 --> 01:40:39,956
Together we will celebrate

1611
01:40:41,202 --> 01:40:42,931
Oh, every day

1612
01:40:43,004 --> 01:40:46,940
We're taking it back
We're doing it here together

1613
01:40:47,008 --> 01:40:51,138
It's better like that
And stronger now than ever

1614
01:40:51,212 --> 01:40:53,112
We're not gonna lose

1615
01:40:53,181 --> 01:40:59,120
'Cause we get to choose
That's how it's gonna be

1616
01:40:59,187 --> 01:41:02,850
Every day of our lives

1617
01:41:02,957 --> 01:41:07,189
Wanna find you there
Wanna hold on tight

1618
01:41:07,295 --> 01:41:09,286
Gonna run

1619
01:41:09,364 --> 01:41:15,633
While we're young
And keep the faith

1620
01:41:15,703 --> 01:41:19,799
Keep the faith

1621
01:41:19,874 --> 01:41:23,867
Every day of our lives

1622
01:41:23,978 --> 01:41:28,142
Wanna find you there
Wanna hold on tight

1623
01:41:28,216 --> 01:41:30,207
Gonna run

1624
01:41:30,318 --> 01:41:35,346
While we're young
And keep the faith

1625
01:41:35,423 --> 01:41:36,583
Oh, yeah

1626
01:41:36,691 --> 01:41:38,556
- Every day
- Every day

1627
01:41:38,660 --> 01:41:40,685
From right now

1628
01:41:40,762 --> 01:41:44,858
Gonna use our voices
and scream out loud

1629
01:41:44,933 --> 01:41:46,992
- Take my hand
- Take my hand

1630
01:41:47,068 --> 01:41:51,835
Together we will celebrate

1631
01:41:53,207 --> 01:41:56,608
- Every day
- Oh, every day

1632
01:41:56,711 --> 01:42:01,011
Oh, oh, every day

1633
01:42:01,082 --> 01:42:05,178
Oh, every day

1634
01:42:06,587 --> 01:42:08,919
Every day

1635
01:42:09,023 --> 01:42:12,754
- Oh, yeah, yeah
- I'm singing every day

1636
01:42:12,860 --> 01:42:14,725
Every day

1637
01:42:14,796 --> 01:42:16,696
Every day

1638
01:42:16,764 --> 01:42:20,097
Every day

1639
01:42:21,436 --> 01:42:23,370
Every day

1640
01:42:24,772 --> 01:42:26,706
Every day

1641
01:42:27,542 --> 01:42:30,841
Every day

1642
01:42:30,945 --> 01:42:33,675
Yeah

1643
01:42:44,325 --> 01:42:48,091
Just fabulous! Fabulous!

1644
01:42:48,162 --> 01:42:51,131
Well. If you'll all
please take your seats.

1645
01:42:51,199 --> 01:42:54,657
I have one last task
to perform this evening.

1646
01:42:54,769 --> 01:43:01,470
The Star Dazzle for this year goes to,
of course, our one and only...

1647
01:43:01,542 --> 01:43:04,875
My brother, Ryan Evans!

1648
01:43:13,821 --> 01:43:15,311
That's our boy!

1649
01:43:17,525 --> 01:43:18,992
Fix the hat.

1650
01:43:27,735 --> 01:43:29,703
Yeah

1651
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:33,671
You are the music in me

1652
01:43:35,410 --> 01:43:38,743
You know the words
"Once upon a time"

1653
01:43:39,047 --> 01:43:41,140
Make you listen

1654
01:43:41,349 --> 01:43:44,910
there's a reason

1655
01:43:45,019 --> 01:43:48,420
When you dream
There's a chance you'll find

1656
01:43:48,523 --> 01:43:53,517
A little laughter, or happy ever after

1657
01:43:53,594 --> 01:43:58,531
You're harmony to the melody

1658
01:43:58,599 --> 01:44:02,330
That's echoing inside my head

1659
01:44:02,670 --> 01:44:04,194
A single voice above the noise

1660
01:44:04,272 --> 01:44:09,039
- Here's to the future.
- No. Here's to right now.

1661
01:44:09,110 --> 01:44:11,408
And like a common thread

1662
01:44:11,579 --> 01:44:13,547
You're pulling me

1663
01:44:13,614 --> 01:44:18,779
When I hear my favorite song
I know that we belong

1664
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:22,287
Oh, you are the music in me

1665
01:44:22,523 --> 01:44:25,390
Yeah, it's living in all of us

1666
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:28,552
And it's brought us here because

1667
01:44:28,629 --> 01:44:32,258
- Because you are the music in me
- Because you are the music in me

1668
01:44:36,137 --> 01:44:38,401
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1669
01:44:38,473 --> 01:44:41,306
You are the music in me

1670
01:44:41,742 --> 01:44:46,645
When I hear my favorite song
I know that we belong

1671
01:44:47,748 --> 01:44:51,275
You are the music in me

1672
01:44:51,385 --> 01:44:53,785
It's living in all of us

1673
01:44:53,888 --> 01:44:56,948
And it's brought us here because

1674
01:44:57,125 --> 01:45:00,561
You are the music in me

1675
01:45:06,567 --> 01:45:09,627
You are the music in me

1676
01:45:10,004 --> 01:45:11,665
One, two, three, four

1677
01:45:37,198 --> 01:45:38,927
The summer that we wanted

1678
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,490
Yeah, we've finally got it

1679
01:45:40,601 --> 01:45:43,434
Now's the time we get to share

1680
01:45:43,504 --> 01:45:45,267
Each day we'll be together

1681
01:45:45,339 --> 01:45:46,863
Now until forever

1682
01:45:46,974 --> 01:45:50,102
So everybody everywhere

1683
01:45:50,178 --> 01:45:53,170
Let's take it to the beach
Take it there together

1684
01:45:53,281 --> 01:45:56,444
Let's celebrate today
'Cause there'll never be another

1685
01:45:56,517 --> 01:45:59,486
We're stronger this time
We've been there for each other

1686
01:45:59,554 --> 01:46:02,284
Everything's just right

1687
01:46:02,356 --> 01:46:05,018
Everybody, all for one

1688
01:46:05,126 --> 01:46:08,562
Our real summer has just begun

1689
01:46:08,963 --> 01:46:12,296
Let's rock and roll, and just let go

1690
01:46:12,366 --> 01:46:14,425
Feel the rhythm of the drums

1691
01:46:14,936 --> 01:46:17,837
We're gonna have fun in the sun

1692
01:46:17,905 --> 01:46:21,864
Now that all the hard work
Work is done

1693
01:46:21,943 --> 01:46:26,437
Everybody one for all
And all for one

1694
01:46:26,547 --> 01:46:30,506
- All for one
- All for one, one

1695
01:46:31,786 --> 01:46:33,253
Summertime together

1696
01:46:33,354 --> 01:46:34,844
Now we're even closer

1697
01:46:34,922 --> 01:46:37,618
That's the way it's meant to be

1698
01:46:37,725 --> 01:46:39,590
Oh, we're just getting started

1699
01:46:39,694 --> 01:46:41,286
Come and join the party

1700
01:46:41,395 --> 01:46:44,455
You deserve it same as me

1701
01:46:44,565 --> 01:46:47,625
Let's take it to the beach
Take it there together

1702
01:46:47,735 --> 01:46:50,863
Let's celebrate today
'Cause there'll never be another

1703
01:46:50,938 --> 01:46:53,907
We're stronger this time
We've been there for each other

1704
01:46:53,975 --> 01:46:56,637
Everything's just right

1705
01:46:56,744 --> 01:46:59,474
Everybody, all for one

1706
01:46:59,580 --> 01:47:03,277
Our real summer has just begun

1707
01:47:03,384 --> 01:47:07,218
Let's rock and roll, and just let go

1708
01:47:07,288 --> 01:47:09,119
Feel the rhythm of the drums

1709
01:47:09,223 --> 01:47:12,283
We're gonna have fun in the sun

1710
01:47:12,393 --> 01:47:16,261
Now that all the hard work
Work is done

1711
01:47:16,330 --> 01:47:20,994
Everybody one for all
And all for one

1712
01:47:23,170 --> 01:47:24,660
Everybody up

1713
01:47:24,772 --> 01:47:26,262
Everybody rock it

1714
01:47:26,340 --> 01:47:27,671
Take it from the top

1715
01:47:27,775 --> 01:47:29,299
And never ever stop it

1716
01:47:29,410 --> 01:47:31,002
It's not about the future

1717
01:47:31,112 --> 01:47:32,511
It's not about the past

1718
01:47:32,613 --> 01:47:36,105
It's making every single day
Last and last and last

1719
01:47:36,183 --> 01:47:38,981
Fun and sun
What could be better?

1720
01:47:42,256 --> 01:47:46,022
Let's have fun
Everyone together now

Everybody, everybody now

1722
01:47:48,796 --> 01:47:52,823
This is where our summer
really begins

1723
01:47:55,036 --> 01:48:01,202
The very last time
it's ever gonna be like this

1724
01:48:01,309 --> 01:48:04,676
It's a party you don't wanna miss

1725
01:48:04,779 --> 01:48:07,873
Guys, show them
we can make some moves, hey

1726
01:48:07,982 --> 01:48:11,145
Girls, show them

1727
01:48:11,218 --> 01:48:12,446

- And now

1728
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:14,351

1729
01:48:14,455 --> 01:48:16,821
Everybody jump in

1730
01:48:16,891 --> 01:48:19,621
Everybody, all for one

1731
01:48:19,694 --> 01:48:22,561
Our real summer has just begun

1732
01:48:23,464 --> 01:48:26,797
Let's rock and roll, and just let go

1733
01:48:26,867 --> 01:48:29,062
Feel the rhythm of the drums

1734
01:48:29,470 --> 01:48:32,405
We're gonna have fun in the sun

1735
01:48:32,506 --> 01:48:36,374
Now that all the hard work
Work is done

1736
01:48:36,477 --> 01:48:39,139
Everybody one for all

1737
01:48:39,213 --> 01:48:42,512
Everybody, all for one

1738
01:48:45,820 --> 01:48:49,187
Let's rock and roll, and just let go

1739
01:48:49,256 --> 01:48:51,656
Feel the rhythm of the drums

1740
01:48:51,726 --> 01:48:54,820
We're gonna have fun in the sun

1741
01:48:54,895 --> 01:48:58,661
Now that all the hard work
Work is done

1742
01:48:58,733 --> 01:49:01,930
Come on, everyone, let's dance

1743
01:49:02,036 --> 01:49:05,233
We can't let the moment pass

1744
01:49:05,339 --> 01:49:09,275
Let's make the party last

1745
01:49:09,677 --> 01:49:11,235
All for one

1746
01:49:11,345 --> 01:49:13,677
All for one

1747
01:49:28,028 --> 01:49:29,120
Yeah!

1748
01:49:40,274 --> 01:49:42,708
Coral blue!
It's totally like your skin tone.

1749
01:49:44,445 --> 01:49:47,209
And mine, too! We are majorly
skin-tone compatible, Troy.

1750
01:49:47,281 --> 01:49:48,908
My daughter.

1751
01:49:58,025 --> 01:49:59,993
Then maybe you should
start answering to yourself!

1752
01:50:12,106 --> 01:50:14,973
By the end of summer,
you'll have me playing like a pro.

1753
01:50:17,545 --> 01:50:18,944
If we live that long.

1754
01:50:22,716 --> 01:50:23,808
For you.

1755
01:50:24,118 --> 01:50:25,176
Cut!

1756
01:50:27,655 --> 01:50:28,713
Troy!

1757
01:50:48,042 --> 01:50:50,374
- Put it in forward.
- It is!
