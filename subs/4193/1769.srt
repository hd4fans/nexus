For politicians,
like our State Senator up there...

everything was on the house.

333

These guys won their comped life
when they got elected.

Why not take advantage of it?

336

Still, the politicians came cheap.
We could handle them.

337
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,919
It's a whale, like K.K. Ichikawa...

00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,931
who plays $30, 000 a hand in baccarat.

That's the one you really gotta watch.

340
00:19:17,069 --> 00:19:20,520
He plays fast and big.
He has the cash and the credit...

341
00:19:20,657 --> 00:19:22,032
to turn out your lights.

342
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:25,694
A year ago he cleaned out a couple
of casinos in the Cayman Islands.

343
00:19:26,247 --> 00:19:28,453
Downstairs he takes us for $2 million...

344
00:19:28,624 --> 00:19:32,373
and upstairs he takes free soap,
shampoo and towels.

345

Another billionaire cheapskate
who loved his free rooms...

00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:39,253
free private jets
and $2 million of our money.

347
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,092
But we got him back.

348
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:44,762
I had our pilot tell him
the plane was on the fritz.

connecting with Japan.

I can't believe there's no room.

a whole floor of rooms to himself.

355

-Sorry you missed your plane.
-You'd like some of my money back.

SAM: And once he was back,
he played small.

359
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,969
He bet $1,000 a hand,
instead of his usual $30,000 a hand.

360
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:29,521
But I knew the trick
with whales like Ichikawa...

361
00:20:29,653 --> 00:20:32,108
was that they can't bet small for long.

362
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:34,570
He didn't think of it as winning $10, 000...

363
00:20:34,659 --> 00:20:37,114
he thought of it as losing $90, 000.

364
00:20:37,955 --> 00:20:39,829
So, he upped his bets.

365
00:20:43,962 --> 00:20:48,007
Until he dropped his winnings back
and gave up $1 million of his own cash.

In a casino, the cardinal rule
is to keep them playing...

was that he was just an unlucky guy.

wanted to nail him.

-for a diamond burglary in Antwerp.
-Help me fold these.

for anything, no matter where.

he told the bookies to fuck off.

I mean, he does the most obvious thing.

This is the only town in the country
where a bookie joint is legit.

So why not take advantage, right?

941
00:54:10,096 --> 00:54:12,551
So he took bookie joints off the street...

and opened them up inside the casino.

943

01:01:22,618 --> 01:01:25,287
-Mint condition coins.
-Mint condition? All right.

1075
01:01:25,413 --> 01:01:27,156
SAM: They all got a piece of the score.

1076
01:01:27,290 --> 01:01:28,524
MAN: Car's coming.

1077
01:01:28,724 --> 01:01:32,626
[Energetic rock music]

1078
01:01:33,339 --> 01:01:34,881
SAM: They were very careful.

1079
01:01:35,384 --> 01:01:38,551
They always bypassed the alarms,
or else, if not...

1080
01:01:38,679 --> 01:01:42,262
they'd drill enough holes to knock through
the walls with a sledgehammer.

1081
01:01:43,853 --> 01:01:45,929
Nicky was grabbing everything he could.

1082
01:01:46,689 --> 01:01:49,061
Nobody out there was expecting
a guy like him.

1083
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:53,822
For Nicky,
Las Vegas was the fucking Wild West.

1084
01:01:53,948 --> 01:01:56,071
I just got a shipment of diamonds
from Israel.

1085
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,197
NICKY: What the fuck did they
expect from me? I had to earn, didn't I?

1086
01:02:00,206 --> 01:02:03,373
-This diamond has flaws in it.
-There's no flaws in it.

1087
01:02:03,502 --> 01:02:06,373
Don't tell me. I'm doing this for 25 years.

1088
01:02:06,464 --> 01:02:09,714
You better clean your loupe,
because there's no flaws in this diamond.

1089
01:02:09,843 --> 01:02:11,467
NICKY: When we got local merch...

1090
01:02:11,554 --> 01:02:14,840
we'd usually send it to Palm Springs,
or Arizona, L.A.

1091
01:02:15,267 --> 01:02:18,019
I had a couple of sand niggers out there.
You know, Arabs.

1092
01:02:18,145 --> 01:02:20,683
Are you gonna have a meeting
or buy some diamonds?

1093
01:02:20,774 --> 01:02:22,980
I know his language. I'm talking with him.

1094
01:02:23,068 --> 01:02:24,895
$40,000, you buy the whole package.

1095
01:02:25,029 --> 01:02:27,069
$20,000. That's my final offer.

1096
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:31,190
He suddenly talks English.
Let's talk turkey. $25,000.

1097
01:02:32,705 --> 01:02:36,324
NICKY: I actually turned my bedroom into
a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.

1098
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:42,755
I couldn't leave it at the Gold Rush
in case we got raided by the cops...

1099
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:44,592
or if my crew got cute.

1100
01:02:45,179 --> 01:02:47,302
I had the only key.
Jennifer didn't give a fuck.

1101
01:02:47,390 --> 01:02:50,344
She fell asleep on the couch
watching TV every night.

1102
01:02:50,769 --> 01:02:54,470
This stuff was all mine.
I didn't send any of this back home.

1103
01:02:54,649 --> 01:02:57,734
Actually, I couldn't,
because I wasn't supposed to be doing it.

1104
01:02:57,861 --> 01:03:00,399
The bosses were making
so much money with the casinos...

1105
01:03:00,531 --> 01:03:02,820
that they didn't want anybody
making any waves.

1106
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:07,160
You've all given your crew a piece of that?

1107
01:03:07,248 --> 01:03:08,826
I took care of everybody.

1108
01:03:09,084 --> 01:03:12,999
NICKY: That's why there was no real
organized street stuff in Vegas before I came.

1109
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:16,712
But how much cash could I bury
in my closet, right?

1110
01:03:16,843 --> 01:03:18,883
You have to understand,
and I'm sure you do...

1111
01:03:19,013 --> 01:03:20,673
that in a venture of this kind...

1112
01:03:20,807 --> 01:03:23,179
you must be prepared
to take some kind of loss.

1113
01:03:23,685 --> 01:03:28,015
NICKY: I put some money in legitimate
deals with Charlie Clark, Ace's banker.

1114
01:03:28,566 --> 01:03:31,104
-You will try to push it through, won't you?
-Yes.

1115
01:03:31,195 --> 01:03:33,401
You got to understand,
I'm giving you $50,000 cash.

1116
01:03:33,531 --> 01:03:37,066
NICKY: Then I put more money
in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.

1117
01:03:37,327 --> 01:03:38,786
DOMINICK: Is that the last one?
COOK: Yeah.

1118
01:03:38,912 --> 01:03:41,201
NICKY: I had my kid brother,
Dominick, run it.

1119
01:03:43,543 --> 01:03:44,788
Fuckers.

1120
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:51,134
DOMINICK: Here you go, guys.

1121
01:03:51,261 --> 01:03:53,467
-Thanks a lot.
-Enjoy it. Have a good time.

1122
01:03:53,931 --> 01:03:55,674
-Choke on it, motherfucker.
-Hi, Dom.

1123
01:03:55,809 --> 01:03:57,007
How you doing?

1124
01:03:57,185 --> 01:04:00,969
SAM: Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants.
He was a real restaurant buff.

1125
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:03,764
And over the years,
he always made money with them.

1126
01:04:03,902 --> 01:04:07,271
In Vegas, he had the Leaning Tower.
It was a very popular spot.

1127
01:04:07,406 --> 01:04:11,487
He had politicians, showgirls
and movie stars hanging out all over.

1128
01:04:11,912 --> 01:04:14,154
That show at The Flamingo
gets better and better.

1129
01:04:14,332 --> 01:04:17,535
By the way, Sammy said whenever
you have a minute, give him a call.

1130
01:04:18,003 --> 01:04:20,541
-Made you a messenger, too?
-I'll do anything for a buck.

1131
01:04:20,673 --> 01:04:24,042
-He does it to everybody. Enjoy your dinner.
-Thanks.

1132
01:04:24,177 --> 01:04:27,878
SAM: I got to tell you, the thing Nicky
liked most was the showgirls.

1133
01:04:28,015 --> 01:04:30,091
To them, Nicky was the movie star.

1134
01:04:30,226 --> 01:04:33,013
-You walk past me?
-This is Shelly.

1135
01:04:33,188 --> 01:04:35,145
-Hi, Shelly. How are you?
-Hi.

1136
01:04:35,233 --> 01:04:36,727
This is Stacy.

1137
01:04:37,027 --> 01:04:40,064
-This is Nick. Wanna have dinner? Come on.
-All right.

1138
01:04:40,197 --> 01:04:42,688
Let's check the kitchen first.
Excuse us one second.

1139
01:04:42,784 --> 01:04:46,319
NICKY: Come on, I'll show you.
I fly stuff in fresh every day.

1140
01:04:46,413 --> 01:04:49,663
I get bread from back home.
I get fish from California.

1141
01:04:49,792 --> 01:04:53,327
You can always tell a great kitchen
like ours because of the milk-fed veal.

1142
01:04:53,589 --> 01:04:56,294
That's the secret.
See, milk-fed veal is pure white.

1143
01:04:56,593 --> 01:04:59,464
Out here, they got that pink veal.
Slide over, honey.

1144
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:04,093
Now, pink veal you can pound for two days.

1145
01:05:04,227 --> 01:05:06,765
NICKY: It'll never ever get tender.
You know what I mean?

1146
01:05:07,773 --> 01:05:10,727
AL: I left here with the money.
Got muscled on the street.

1147
01:05:10,902 --> 01:05:14,105
A couple guys, I owe them.
So I gave them the money.

1148
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:16,280
-That's what I did.
-Yeah?

1149
01:05:16,617 --> 01:05:18,325
You call yourself a man?

1150
01:05:18,453 --> 01:05:22,783
You know you're a lying lowlife,
motherfucking gambling degenerate prick?

1151
01:05:22,917 --> 01:05:25,539
You know that's what you are?
Two small kids at home.

1152
01:05:25,754 --> 01:05:27,663
I gave you money to pay the fucking rent...

1153
01:05:27,798 --> 01:05:29,791
and buy groceries, put the heat on.

1154
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:33,427
You know your wife called Frankie
and told him the fucking heat's off?

1155
01:05:33,597 --> 01:05:35,969
You didn't gamble that money?
Can you tell me that?

1156
01:05:36,142 --> 01:05:37,684
-No, you didn't?
-I didn't.

1157
01:05:37,852 --> 01:05:40,972
Don't fuck with me, Al!
Don't make a fuck out of me.

1158
01:05:41,482 --> 01:05:44,187
You wanna make a fool out of me?
You didn't gamble?

1159
01:05:44,861 --> 01:05:48,859
Tell me you gambled the money and
I'll give you the money to put the heat on!

1160
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:50,980
Did you gamble?

1161
01:05:55,708 --> 01:05:57,167
Fucking degenerate, you.

1162
01:05:58,169 --> 01:05:59,449
Fucking kids at home.

1163
01:06:03,467 --> 01:06:05,341
Here. Get the fuck out of here.

1164
01:06:06,346 --> 01:06:07,970
AL: Thanks, Nick.
NICKY: Yeah, thanks.

1165
01:06:08,098 --> 01:06:10,969
If I find out you fucked up,
I'll leave you where I find you.

1166
01:06:11,853 --> 01:06:14,344
NICKY: How many of these you gonna eat?
NICKY JR.: Two.

1167
01:06:15,232 --> 01:06:18,019
SAM: At around 6:30 a.m.,
when he finished his day...

1168
01:06:18,152 --> 01:06:20,310
no matter where he was
or what he was doing...

1169
01:06:20,405 --> 01:06:23,525
he always went home to make breakfast
for his son, Nicky boy.

1170
01:06:23,993 --> 01:06:25,191
NICKY: I know you like this.

1171
01:06:26,162 --> 01:06:29,329
NICKY: A little butter, right?
Not a lot. You know why, right?

1172
01:06:29,959 --> 01:06:32,201
NICKY: Why?
NICKY JR.: 'Cause it clogs up your heart.

1173
01:06:33,046 --> 01:06:35,086
What a smart kid you are.

1174
01:06:36,050 --> 01:06:37,046
NICKY: Okay, eat.

1175
01:06:37,343 --> 01:06:40,297
NICKY: Every couple of weeks,
I sent Marino back to the bosses...

1176
01:06:40,388 --> 01:06:44,303
BACK HOME
with a piece of what I made.
Not a big piece, but what did they know?

1177
01:06:44,519 --> 01:06:48,019
They were 1,500 miles away, and I don't
know anybody who can see that far.

1178
01:06:48,607 --> 01:06:50,350
Their drop was a truck stop garage...

1179
01:06:50,484 --> 01:06:53,569
where Remo and the guys
used to hang out and count their millions.

1180
01:06:54,573 --> 01:06:57,574
The cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck.
They worked it out.

1181
01:06:57,702 --> 01:06:59,576
Nicky sends his warmest regards.

1182
01:06:59,662 --> 01:07:01,702
NICKY: I knew how to keep
the bosses happy.

1183
01:07:01,790 --> 01:07:05,159
Whenever they gave me little jobs to do,
you know, to send a message...

1184
01:07:05,294 --> 01:07:08,913
I would carry things out to a "T."

1185
01:07:09,216 --> 01:07:13,261
Like the time Tony Dogs, who was supposed
to be the new maniac tough guy in town...

1186
01:07:13,388 --> 01:07:15,096
shot up one of Remo's bars.

1187
01:07:20,063 --> 01:07:22,850
Here's a fucking guy
who kills two of Remo's guys...

1188
01:07:22,983 --> 01:07:26,684
and a poor fucking waitress
who was just working on her night off.

1189
01:07:29,825 --> 01:07:33,028
This guy's just begging
to be made an example of.

1190
01:07:33,413 --> 01:07:36,782
I want the names of all the other people
he had with him.

1191
01:07:36,917 --> 01:07:40,536
I don't care what you have to do to them
to get them. You understand?

1192
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:41,828
FRANK: I'll take care of it.

1193
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:46,003
NICKY: To be truthful with you,
I had to admire this fucking guy.

1194
01:07:46,137 --> 01:07:48,509
He was one of the toughest
Irishmen I ever met.

1195
01:07:49,016 --> 01:07:50,759
This son of a bitch was tough.

1196
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:54,727
For two days and two nights,
we beat the shit out of him.

1197
01:07:54,814 --> 01:07:56,854
We even stuck ice picks in his balls.

1198
01:07:57,109 --> 01:08:00,063
NICKY: Hope he gives me a name,
or I'll give him yours, Frank.

1199
01:08:00,196 --> 01:08:01,227
FRANK: Thanks a lot.

1200
01:08:01,364 --> 01:08:02,395
NICKY: But he never talked.

1201
01:08:02,491 --> 01:08:04,199
NICKY: I know you would've ratted by now.

1202
01:08:04,285 --> 01:08:06,990
NICKY: In the end,
I had to put his fucking head in a vice.

1203
01:08:08,206 --> 01:08:09,534
NICKY: Can you hear me?

1204
01:08:10,125 --> 01:08:12,996
Listen to me. I got your head in a vice.

1205
01:08:13,129 --> 01:08:17,210
I'll squash your head like a grapefruit
if you don't give me a name.

1206
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:19,668
NICKY: Don't make me do this.
Please, come on.

1207
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:21,927
Don't make me be a bad guy.

1208
01:08:23,684 --> 01:08:24,964
Fuck you.

1209
01:08:25,144 --> 01:08:28,181
Motherfucker. You believe this?
Two fucking days and nights.

1210
01:08:28,315 --> 01:08:31,269
Fuck me? You motherfucker!

1211
01:08:31,402 --> 01:08:34,107
Fuck my mother?
Is that what you're telling me?

1212
01:08:34,197 --> 01:08:35,857
You motherfucker!

1213
01:08:37,659 --> 01:08:40,328
Oh, God. Give me the fucking name!

1214
01:08:40,496 --> 01:08:41,824
Charlie M.

1215
01:08:42,666 --> 01:08:44,493
-Charlie M.
-Charlie M?

1216
01:08:44,835 --> 01:08:47,504
You make me pop your eye out your head...

1217
01:08:47,589 --> 01:08:49,416
to protect that piece of shit?

1218

About how much?

No. I'm just curious. I was wondering...

how much he would put
into a thing like that.

1380

maybe more.

the fucking bottom line here is cash.

1519
01:26:47,488 --> 01:26:49,694
The only problem was that after a while...

1520
01:26:49,823 --> 01:26:53,358
the bosses noticed that
the suitcases were getting a little light.

1521
01:26:54,620 --> 01:26:57,075
Wait a minute. You mean to tell me...

1522
01:26:57,165 --> 01:26:59,620
that the money we're robbing
is being robbed?

1523
01:26:59,834 --> 01:27:01,625
Somebody's robbing from us?

1524
01:27:01,836 --> 01:27:04,920
We go through all this fucking trouble
and somebody's robbing us?

1525
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:09,801
Like I said, it's part of the business.
It's considered leakage.

1526
01:27:09,887 --> 01:27:12,259
Leakage, my balls.
I want the guy who's robbing us.

1527
01:27:12,389 --> 01:27:15,058
NICKY: Even John Nance,
that's the guy who ran the scam...

1528
01:27:15,184 --> 01:27:17,223
he knew there wasn't much
he could do about it.

1529
01:27:17,353 --> 01:27:19,641
You gotta know that
a guy who helps you steal...

1530
01:27:19,731 --> 01:27:21,889
even if you take care of him real well...

1531
01:27:22,192 --> 01:27:24,268
he's gonna steal a little extra for himself.

1532
01:27:24,361 --> 01:27:26,519
Makes sense, don't it? Right?

1533
01:27:26,738 --> 01:27:30,189
You go try and make these hard-headed
old greaseballs understand that.

1534
01:27:30,367 --> 01:27:32,655
What's the point of skimming
if we're being skimmed?

1535
01:27:32,786 --> 01:27:35,359
It defeats the whole purpose
of what we're doing.

1536
01:27:35,748 --> 01:27:40,125
They take this money because they're
my guys, so give them some leeway.

1537
01:27:40,253 --> 01:27:42,230
NICKY: But the bosses never believed
in leeway...

1538
01:27:42,430 --> 01:27:44,506
so listen to what they do.

1539
01:27:44,633 --> 01:27:47,503
They put Artie Piscano,
the underboss of K. C...

1540
01:27:47,594 --> 01:27:51,093
in charge of making sure
nobody skimmed the skim.

1541
01:27:51,223 --> 01:27:53,678
BOSS: What were you doing?
I was with my cumari.

1542
01:27:53,767 --> 01:27:56,970
BOSS: What were you doing
with your cumari?
I gave her a schiaffo.

1543
01:27:57,104 --> 01:27:59,642
NICKY: The only trouble was,
Piscano was a disaster.

1544
01:27:59,774 --> 01:28:01,850
This guy could fuck up a cup of coffee.

1545
01:28:01,985 --> 01:28:05,021
BOSS: What you been doing?
ARTIE: I'm out there more than I'm here.

1546
01:28:05,155 --> 01:28:07,527
NICKY: Little did anybody know
where this would lead.

1547
01:28:07,657 --> 01:28:11,073
If they did, they would've
been better off making fucking novenas.

1548
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:13,528
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.

1549
01:28:13,622 --> 01:28:16,492
-My expenses weren't paid for the last trip.
-What expenses?

1550
01:28:16,626 --> 01:28:20,540
I'm laying money out of my own pocket,
and I never get anything back.

1551
01:28:20,672 --> 01:28:22,130
You gotta go back out there.

1552
01:28:22,215 --> 01:28:24,753
From now on,
I'm gonna start keeping records.

1553
01:28:25,135 --> 01:28:28,171
What are you gonna do with records,
pay taxes?

1554
01:28:28,305 --> 01:28:31,756
I can't keep laying out
my own fucking dough for these trips.

1555
01:28:31,934 --> 01:28:33,926
What the hell are we doing over here?

1556
01:28:34,061 --> 01:28:36,978
You're going to Las Vegas and having
a good time at my expense.

1557
01:28:37,106 --> 01:28:38,979
What the fuck? I mean, after all....

1558
01:28:39,108 --> 01:28:41,100
SAM: No matter how many
novenas you could make...

1559
01:28:41,194 --> 01:28:43,899
nothing was gonna stop
what came up next at the casino.

1560
01:28:43,988 --> 01:28:46,443
PHILIP: I can't believe you're doing this.
ANNA: We made a deal.

1561
01:28:47,117 --> 01:28:48,963
SAM: It turned out Phil Green,
"Mr. Integrity"...

1562
01:28:49,163 --> 01:28:51,529
had a partner nobody knew about...

1563
01:28:51,663 --> 01:28:54,829
and when she showed up
and demanded money from Tangiers...

1564
01:28:54,959 --> 01:28:57,497
-Why are you doing this to me?
-Because you're wrong.

1565
01:28:57,628 --> 01:28:58,956
ANNA: I'm not.
PHILIP: You are.

1566
01:28:59,130 --> 01:29:00,292
No, I am not wrong.

1567
01:29:00,381 --> 01:29:02,041
...Green tried to stonewall her.

1568
01:29:02,216 --> 01:29:04,671
ANNA: I will see that
you don't get away with this.

1569
01:29:04,886 --> 01:29:06,510
So, she sued him in court.

1570
01:29:06,638 --> 01:29:09,259
The court will now hear the matter
of Anna Scott...

1571
01:29:09,349 --> 01:29:12,884
against Tangiers Corporation
and its President, Philip Green.

1572
01:29:12,978 --> 01:29:16,845
OBERON: Oberon on behalf of Mr. Green.
LOGAN: Logan on behalf of Anna Scott.

1573
01:29:17,191 --> 01:29:19,397
JUDGE: Mr. Oberon, you can proceed.
OBERON: Thank you.

1574
01:29:20,111 --> 01:29:23,444
I believe he was fair,
and I'm delighted with the decision.

1575
01:29:23,531 --> 01:29:24,859
We got a problem.

1576
01:29:28,703 --> 01:29:31,454
It didn't go too well.
Green has to open up the books...

1577
01:29:31,582 --> 01:29:33,954
has to show how he got the financing.

1578
01:29:34,043 --> 01:29:36,000
That's not good.

1579
01:29:39,674 --> 01:29:41,797
NICKY: She was doing pretty good
with her lawsuit.

1580
01:29:41,926 --> 01:29:43,965
But before she could start
counting her money...

1581
01:29:44,095 --> 01:29:47,298
the boys back home decided
to settle the case out of court.

1582
01:29:47,432 --> 01:29:48,630
So they sent me.

1583
01:30:04,951 --> 01:30:07,323
REPORTER: Any comment on
the murder of Anna Scott?

1584
01:30:07,537 --> 01:30:10,988
What are you talking about?
REPORTER: She was found last night
shot in the head.

1585
01:30:11,083 --> 01:30:12,909
MAN: Was this just
a real estate partnership?

1586
01:30:13,043 --> 01:30:14,834
MAN 2: Her lawyer said you were partners.

1587
01:30:15,546 --> 01:30:19,164
We were involved
in minor real estate deals many years ago.

1588
01:30:19,258 --> 01:30:20,586
It was never a partnership.

1589
01:30:22,053 --> 01:30:24,888
MAN: Did you ever hear
of the .22 caliber killer?

1590
01:30:25,056 --> 01:30:27,677
SAM: Now, Instead of the cops
only looking at Nicky...

1591
01:30:27,767 --> 01:30:29,676
they started looking at Green, too.

1592
01:30:29,811 --> 01:30:32,384
And he was supposed to be
our squeaky-clean front man.

1593
01:30:32,564 --> 01:30:35,648
I had to start giving interviews
to make sure everybody knew...

1594
01:30:35,734 --> 01:30:37,311
the casino was on the up-and-up.

1595
01:30:37,444 --> 01:30:39,686
So how often do you really fill in for him?

1596
01:30:43,159 --> 01:30:45,531
Green's here about two or three times
a month...

1597
01:30:45,620 --> 01:30:48,656
and he's busy
with other real estate deals, and things.

1598
01:30:49,416 --> 01:30:51,574
So in Green's absence,
then, you're the boss?

1599
01:30:52,586 --> 01:30:55,255
I serve at the pleasure
of the Chairman of the Board.

1600
01:30:56,256 --> 01:31:00,088
My responsibilities are
to run the day-to-day operations.

1601
01:31:00,469 --> 01:31:02,177
So day-to-day, then, you're the boss?

1602
01:31:02,305 --> 01:31:06,801
Well, in a sense, you could say
that I am the boss...

1603
01:31:06,935 --> 01:31:08,892
when Mr. Green is away.

1604
01:31:11,523 --> 01:31:12,721
You could say that.

1605
01:31:12,858 --> 01:31:13,557


1606
01:31:14,359 --> 01:31:15,604
PAT: Have you read this?

1607
01:31:16,195 --> 01:31:17,653
About Mr. Rothstein.

1608
01:31:18,364 --> 01:31:21,649
It says, "The Midwest bookmaker
with mob ties...

1609
01:31:21,784 --> 01:31:26,078
"says that he is the real boss
of the $100 million Tangiers casino empire."

1610
01:31:26,664 --> 01:31:29,333
PAT: Do you believe that?
OFFICIAL: Did he really say that?

1611
01:31:29,501 --> 01:31:31,992
Why, of course he really said that.
It's right here.

1612
01:31:33,171 --> 01:31:36,337
Has that man even filed for his license yet?

1613
01:31:36,466 --> 01:31:38,505
I don't know. We have to check the files.

1614
01:31:38,594 --> 01:31:41,714
Without getting your shorts in a knot,
would you do that?

1615
01:31:41,806 --> 01:31:45,886
And check closely, 'cause we may
have to kick a kike's ass out of town.

1616
01:31:47,186 --> 01:31:48,514
PAT: Thank you.

1617
01:31:49,810 --> 01:31:53,351
A Gaming Control Board investigation
of Tangiers executive...

1618
01:31:53,443 --> 01:31:56,479
Sam Rothstein's application
for a gaming license is underway.

1619
01:31:56,613 --> 01:32:00,588
Rothstein, who heads the Tangiers casino
operation and is a boyhood friend...

1620
01:32:01,288 --> 01:32:03,924
of Las Vegas mob boss Nicky Santoro...

1621
01:32:04,124 --> 01:32:07,202
could lose his ability
to work in the casino....

1622
01:32:07,527 --> 01:32:09,051
[Phone rings]

1623
01:32:11,087 --> 01:32:12,082
Hello?

1624
01:32:12,171 --> 01:32:16,500
I gotta meet Clean Face right away.
What about the Chez Paris?

1625
01:32:16,634 --> 01:32:18,792
You gotta make a reservation.
It's all booked up.

1626
01:32:18,887 --> 01:32:19,882
NICKY: No, it's okay.

1627
01:32:20,013 --> 01:32:23,410
I don't want a meeting at my house.
It's impossible. It's booked up,
and it's very difficult to get in.

1628
01:32:23,610 --> 01:32:27,595
It's okay, I'll use the service entrance.
I'll see you at nine.

1629
01:32:27,730 --> 01:32:28,975
All right.

1630
01:32:30,733 --> 01:32:33,821
The battle between state gaming
officials and Tangiers casino boss...

1631
01:32:34,021 --> 01:32:36,323
Sam "Ace" Rothstein is heating up.

1632
01:32:36,523 --> 01:32:40,627
Tonight, a look at Ace Rothstein's
attempt to get state licensing...

1633
01:32:40,827 --> 01:32:45,497
despite law-enforcement allegations of
Rothstein's organized crime connections.

1634
01:32:45,707 --> 01:32:49,470
Will Sam Rothstein's friendship
with organized crime figure, Nicky Santoro...

1635
01:32:49,670 --> 01:32:52,206
keep Rothstein
from running the Tangiers casino?

1636
01:32:52,406 --> 01:32:56,310
And can the integrity of state gaming laws
be jeopardized by a boyhood friendship?

1637
01:32:56,510 --> 01:32:59,377
SAM: Why don't you take it easy
on that stuff?

1638
01:33:00,849 --> 01:33:02,972
Come on. Let me help you down.

1639
01:33:03,101 --> 01:33:04,381
We're talking about some stuff.

1640
01:33:04,519 --> 01:33:06,511
NEWSCASTER: At 6:00,
will a boyhood friendship...

1641
01:33:06,605 --> 01:33:08,722
unseat Rothstein
as the Tangiers casino boss?

1642
01:33:08,922 --> 01:33:12,520
Exclusive on the KBBO special news report.

1643
01:33:14,071 --> 01:33:16,562
Go down. Just go downstairs.

1644
01:33:21,746 --> 01:33:25,364
You can't let this concern you, Ace.
Don't worry about that stuff.

1645
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:27,291
It's just a political witch hunt.

1646
01:33:35,219 --> 01:33:36,927
SAM: Do you want something to drink?

1647
01:33:37,055 --> 01:33:39,593
-Charlie, you want a refill?
-Yeah, that would be great.

1648
01:33:39,682 --> 01:33:43,051
I don't want nothing. Hi, Mr. Clark.
I've been trying to reach you.

1649
01:33:43,145 --> 01:33:45,896
-You're tougher to get than the President.
-I've been busy.

1650
01:33:46,023 --> 01:33:48,596
Yeah? At least you could return
my phone calls, though.

1651
01:33:48,734 --> 01:33:51,735
Listen, Nicky, we talked about this.

1652
01:33:51,965 --> 01:33:57,031
And I explained to you that you might
have to take some kind of loss.

1653
01:33:58,071 --> 01:33:59,095
Yeah.

1654
01:34:00,497 --> 01:34:02,039
I think I want my money back.

1655
01:34:03,176 --> 01:34:05,951
What are you gonna do, strong-arm me?

1656
01:34:07,013 --> 01:34:10,505
I think you've gotten
the wrong impression about me.

1657
01:34:11,251 --> 01:34:12,986
I think, in all fairness...

1658
01:34:13,186 --> 01:34:16,678
I should explain to you
exactly what it is that I do.

1659
01:34:17,473 --> 01:34:21,636
Tomorrow morning I'll get up nice
and early, take a walk to the bank...

1660
01:34:21,828 --> 01:34:25,165
and walk in and see,
and if you don't have my money for me...

1661
01:34:25,365 --> 01:34:29,392
I'll crack your fucking head
wide open in front of everybody.

1662
01:34:29,536 --> 01:34:32,775
And just about the time
that I'm coming out of jail...

1663
01:34:32,939 --> 01:34:36,486
hopefully, you'll be coming
out of your coma.

1664
01:34:36,676 --> 01:34:40,447
And guess what? I'll split
your fucking head open again.

1665
01:34:40,647 --> 01:34:44,447
'Cause I'm fucking stupid.
I don't give a fuck about jail.

1666
01:34:44,618 --> 01:34:47,743
That's my business. That's what I do.

1667
01:34:48,288 --> 01:34:49,590
We know what you do.

1668
01:34:49,790 --> 01:34:52,630
You fuck people out of money
and get away with it.

1669
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:55,211
You can't talk to me like that.
NICKY: You fat Irish prick!

1670
01:34:55,348 --> 01:34:58,514
You put my money to sleep.
Get it, or I'll put your brain to sleep.

1671
01:34:58,726 --> 01:35:01,014
Never mind Sam. This is personal.

1672
01:35:01,145 --> 01:35:03,896
I'll be there in the morning.
You can try me, fatso.

1673
01:35:07,194 --> 01:35:09,566
-You think he got the point?
-What are you doing?

1674
01:35:09,696 --> 01:35:12,980
He's a square guy, for Christ's sakes.
He's gonna run to the FBI.

1675
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:15,882
That prick's been dodging me
for three weeks.

1676
01:35:16,082 --> 01:35:19,853
-You're trying to tell me what to do?
-I'm not trying to tell you what to do.

1677
01:35:20,053 --> 01:35:23,117
You're way out of line. Where's your head?

1678
01:35:23,211 --> 01:35:25,334
Where's my head?
Where's your fucking balls?

1679
01:35:25,592 --> 01:35:30,325
I'm trying to put something big together.
You know what I'm talking about.

1680
01:35:30,385 --> 01:35:33,505
If you're acting like this now,
how can I depend on you?

1681
01:35:33,597 --> 01:35:36,467
A lot of things gonna change.
If you wanna be there with me...

1682
01:35:36,559 --> 01:35:38,516
you're gonna have to go my way.

1683
01:35:38,644 --> 01:35:42,179
You got to understand my situation.
I'm responsible for thousands of people.

1684
01:35:42,315 --> 01:35:44,521
SAM: I got $100 million a year
going through the place.

1685
01:35:44,609 --> 01:35:47,812
It's all over if I don't get that license.

1686
01:35:47,904 --> 01:35:51,652
Believe me, if it goes bad for me,
it's gonna go bad for a lot of people.

1687
01:35:51,784 --> 01:35:52,853
Forget about your fucking license.

1688
01:35:53,053 --> 01:35:56,578
I plant my own flag out here,
you ain't gonna need a license.

1689
01:35:58,058 --> 01:36:00,994
I don't know what it is,
but the more I talk to you...

1690
01:36:01,194 --> 01:36:04,581
the more I feel like you just
don't want to go along with me.

1691
01:36:04,714 --> 01:36:07,584
-No, I don't want to come along with you.
-All right.

1692
01:36:07,676 --> 01:36:10,879
I don't want to be involved
in anything you're talking about, okay?

1693
01:36:10,971 --> 01:36:13,343
I want to run a square joint.
I just want my license.

1694
01:36:13,432 --> 01:36:15,471
I want everything quiet. That's it!

1695
01:36:15,601 --> 01:36:17,807
Quiet like this?
"I'm the boss"? That's quiet?

1696
01:36:17,937 --> 01:36:19,929
It's taken out of context. I had no control.

1697
01:36:20,064 --> 01:36:22,519
Ronnie and Billy will tell you
exactly what happened.

1698
01:36:22,608 --> 01:36:24,399
Back home that looks bad.

1699
01:36:24,527 --> 01:36:29,236
Looks bad? Every time you're on television,
I get mentioned. That looks bad.

1700
01:36:29,574 --> 01:36:31,365
What the fuck happened to you?

1701
01:36:31,493 --> 01:36:34,162
-What happened to you? You lost control?
-I lost control?

1702
01:36:34,288 --> 01:36:36,779
You're fucking walking around
like John Barrymore.

1703
01:36:36,916 --> 01:36:41,101
A pink robe and a fucking cigarette holder?
I lost control?

1704
01:36:41,301 --> 01:36:46,755
I don't wanna bring this up, but you treat
people with disrespect. Even your own wife.

1705
01:36:46,973 --> 01:36:49,242
My wife? What does she have
to do with this?

1706
01:36:49,442 --> 01:36:54,841
She was upset about a lot of things,
especially that Lester Diamond incident.

1707
01:36:55,048 --> 01:36:59,185
You're the shoulder to cry on?
Did you tell her about your role in that?

1708
01:36:59,315 --> 01:37:01,603
No, that's not the fucking point.

1709
01:37:01,734 --> 01:37:04,091
The point is, she's upset,
and you've got a problem.

1710
01:37:04,291 --> 01:37:07,394
I'd appreciate it if you'd stay out
of my personal life.

1711
01:37:07,490 --> 01:37:09,529
You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.

1712
01:37:09,659 --> 01:37:13,158
She came to talk to me.
Was I supposed to throw her out?

1713
01:37:13,247 --> 01:37:16,616
Stay away from her.
It's none of your business.

1714
01:37:16,709 --> 01:37:21,620
A week ago it was. Now it's not.
When you need me, you need me.

1715
01:37:21,964 --> 01:37:24,834
Right, the way you need me
to vouch for you as a citizen.

1716
01:37:24,926 --> 01:37:27,796
I'm gonna have to straighten out
what you did with this guy.

1717
01:37:27,929 --> 01:37:29,637
This guy's gonna run to the FBI.

1718
01:37:29,764 --> 01:37:32,385
NICKY: Your head's bigger than your casino.
That's your problem.

1719
01:37:32,517 --> 01:37:36,894
SAM: I knew what he wanted
and I didn't want any part of it.
He wanted to take over.

1720
01:37:37,022 --> 01:37:41,294
He wanted to go after Gaggi,
the skim, everything and everybody.

1721
01:37:41,494 --> 01:37:45,563
He also stopped asking permission
from back home for every little thing.

1722
01:37:49,803 --> 01:37:54,279
A casino boss and his wife were killed.
The bulls questioned Nicky.

1723
01:37:55,292 --> 01:37:58,495
A dealer from the Scirocco.
They questioned Nicky.

1724
01:37:58,629 --> 01:38:01,982
Stool pigeons wound up in the trunks
of their cars. They questioned Nicky.

1725
01:38:02,182 --> 01:38:03,873
A lawyer.

1726
01:38:06,353 --> 01:38:07,022
They questioned Nicky.

1727
01:38:07,222 --> 01:38:10,620
When some guys who didn't pay
their shylocks began disappearing...

1728
01:38:11,191 --> 01:38:13,927
Nicky's name was in every newspaper.

1729
01:38:14,127 --> 01:38:17,931
Nicky was questioned in two dozen
murders, but they always had to let him go.

1730
01:38:18,131 --> 01:38:19,979
There were never any witnesses.

1731
01:38:20,069 --> 01:38:23,603
NICKY: The coppers blamed me
for everything that went wrong.

1732
01:38:23,803 --> 01:38:26,365
Watch yourself.
You're gonna get runned over.

1733
01:38:26,451 --> 01:38:30,283
NICKY: If a guy tripped over
a banana peel, they'd bring me in for it.

1734
01:38:30,377 --> 01:38:31,845
Be nice.

1735
01:38:32,045 --> 01:38:36,049
NICKY: The bosses were no better.
They complained because things
don't run smooth.

1736
01:38:36,249 --> 01:38:39,519
In my line of work,
things don't run so smooth. I'm sorry.

1737
01:38:39,719 --> 01:38:41,688
I'm dealing with degenerate
animals out here.

1738
01:38:41,888 --> 01:38:43,690
The bosses, what do they give a fuck?

1739
01:38:43,890 --> 01:38:46,193
They're sitting on their asses
drinking anisette.

1740
01:38:46,393 --> 01:38:48,662
Meanwhile, I'm the guy in the trenches.

1741
01:38:48,862 --> 01:38:52,354
Fucking bosses think it's
a fucking free lunch out here.

1742
01:38:53,233 --> 01:38:57,105
Frankie, they found
a guy's head in the desert.

1743
01:38:57,871 --> 01:38:59,539
You know about that?

1744
01:38:59,739 --> 01:39:01,041
I heard.

1745
01:39:01,241 --> 01:39:05,479
Everybody's talking about it and making
a big deal out of it. It's in all the papers.

1746
01:39:05,679 --> 01:39:07,247
What are you gonna do?

1747
01:39:07,447 --> 01:39:09,496
That's no good.

1748
01:39:10,373 --> 01:39:14,157
Tell him to take care of things a little better.

1749
01:39:15,379 --> 01:39:16,493
I'll tell him, Remo.

1750
01:39:16,630 --> 01:39:18,692
NICKY: Fucking bosses
smoking their Di Nobilis...

1751
01:39:18,892 --> 01:39:22,028
and eating trip' and fucking soffrit',
fried pigs' guts...

1752
01:39:22,228 --> 01:39:25,532
while if I wanna talk private,
I gotta go to a fucking bus stop.

1753
01:39:25,732 --> 01:39:30,003
-What do they care? Long as I send money.
-They're complaining.

1754
01:39:30,203 --> 01:39:34,037
Let them complain. I'm the one
who's here. I do all the work.

1755
01:39:34,107 --> 01:39:38,060
NICKY: Somebody don't like it, fuck them.
FRANK: It's up to you.

1756
01:39:38,545 --> 01:39:41,105
NICKY: They want a fucking war? I'm ready.

1757
01:39:41,699 --> 01:39:46,076
If I take care of five of those guys,
the rest will fall into place.

1758
01:39:46,753 --> 01:39:49,785
NICKY: Peek-a-boo, you fucks, you.

1759
01:39:49,956 --> 01:39:51,625
I see you, you motherfuckers.

1760
01:39:51,825 --> 01:39:55,395
SAM: Nicky was not only bringing heat
on himself, but on me, too.

1761
01:39:55,595 --> 01:40:00,066
The FBI watched every move he made,
but he just didn't care.

1762
01:40:00,266 --> 01:40:03,103
NICKY: If they're gonna watch me,
I'm gonna watch them back.

1763
01:40:03,303 --> 01:40:06,806
I spent a few bucks. Top dollar.
Who gives a shit?

1764
01:40:06,934 --> 01:40:10,777
I got the latest anti-bugging equipment
from the same places that sell to the CIA.

1765
01:40:10,977 --> 01:40:16,475
I had all the special police frequency radios,
FBI de-scramblers, night-vision cameras....

1766
01:40:16,816 --> 01:40:22,238
So, the miserable sons of bitches never
caught me doing anything I couldn't handle.

1767
01:40:22,288 --> 01:40:26,118
SAM: I got my job on the line,
he's having the time of his life.

1768
01:40:26,247 --> 01:40:29,532
He has every cop in the state watching him,
and he's out playing golf.

1769
01:40:30,335 --> 01:40:32,826
And at the worst possible time for me.

1770
01:40:33,166 --> 01:40:37,711
I had my license hearing coming up and
I didn't want to leave anything to chance.

1771
01:40:38,872 --> 01:40:41,007
If I can't work in Vegas,
where am I gonna go?

1772
01:40:41,207 --> 01:40:44,744
You've been very open with us
with the books and papers.

1773
01:40:44,944 --> 01:40:47,347
That'll mean a lot
when you go before the commission.

1774
01:40:47,547 --> 01:40:51,451
-All I ask is a fair hearing.
-This honesty will guarantee it.

1775
01:40:51,651 --> 01:40:52,743
[Plane engine sputtering]

1776
01:40:52,819 --> 01:40:54,859
We'll move on to....

1777
01:40:55,955 --> 01:41:00,230
SAM: I want to hear about Kansas City.

1778
01:41:01,161 --> 01:41:03,201
What the fuck is this?

1779
01:41:05,198 --> 01:41:08,328
Where's this fucking guy gonna land,
in the fairway?

1780
01:41:27,987 --> 01:41:30,806
They're fucking agents, Frankie.
Look at this.

1781
01:41:32,358 --> 01:41:34,861
SAM: The Feds were watching
Nicky play golf for so long...

1782
01:41:35,061 --> 01:41:36,892
they ran out of gas.

1783
01:41:37,831 --> 01:41:41,494
Just what I needed,
right in front of the control board.

1784
01:41:45,772 --> 01:41:48,502
$100, whoever hits the plane.

1785
01:41:50,743 --> 01:41:55,015
SAM: If things weren't bad enough...
in comes Piscano,
the Kansas City underboss.

1786
01:41:55,215 --> 01:41:58,652
He ran the grocery store in Kansas City
where they brought the suitcases.

1787
01:41:58,852 --> 01:42:01,821
Fighting over those suitcases again.
You know what that means?

1788
01:42:02,021 --> 01:42:05,659
I gotta take another trip to Vegas.
It's gonna cost me another couple grand.

1789
01:42:05,859 --> 01:42:07,932
SAM: He ran it with his brother-in-law...

1790
01:42:08,023 --> 01:42:12,400
but he mostly complained about his trips
to Vegas to his brother-in-law and mother.

1791
01:42:12,528 --> 01:42:15,268
You gotta lay down the law,
or they'll make a fool out of you.

1792
01:42:15,468 --> 01:42:18,938
I write it all down.
Every fucking nickel goes down.

1793
01:42:19,138 --> 01:42:23,409
-What's the matter with you?
-Everything's here.

1794
01:42:23,498 --> 01:42:25,490
-Since when do you talk like that?
-I'm sorry.

1795
01:42:25,626 --> 01:42:29,416
Nance gives me trouble, I'll
take the eyes out of his freaking head.

1796
01:42:29,616 --> 01:42:31,885
-Again.
-I didn't curse, I said, "freaking head."

1797
01:42:32,085 --> 01:42:33,837
-That's enough.
-I'm sorry.

1798
01:42:33,968 --> 01:42:36,007
SAM: What happens next,
you can't believe it.

1799
01:42:36,262 --> 01:42:38,258
Who'd believe the FBI
had a wire in the place...

1800
01:42:38,458 --> 01:42:40,894
looking for information
about some old homicide...

1801
01:42:41,094 --> 01:42:44,564
about some guy who was whacked out
God knows when over God knows what?

1802
01:42:44,764 --> 01:42:47,701
What prevents him with the suitcases
from taking what he wants?

1803
01:42:47,901 --> 01:42:51,771
Nance brings back two suitcases from
the Tangiers. What about three or four?

1804
01:42:51,971 --> 01:42:54,774
We've got nobody in the room to watch.

They could all be in on it together.

01:43:03,983 --> 01:43:07,087
I'll find out. If it's Green himself,
I'll bury that bastard.

I never trusted him.
I got eyes behind my head.

They trust that scumbag. I don't.

1810

I'll hit the two of them

I know, but that's enough.

You know what they're doing to me.
I can't take this no more.

they hear all this stuff...

about Las Vegas, casinos, and suitcases...

Mr. Rothstein is pleased to be here today.

I felt so confident that all I had
to do was present my case.

COUNSELOR: We have documents, one of
which is a report by retired FBI agents...

1834
01:44:22,729 --> 01:44:25,732
which completely absolves Mr. Rothstein
from any wrongdoing.

Mr. Chairman, I second the motion.

Do I have a vote on the motion?

-You have to be kidding.
-Adjourned? What do you mean?

1844
01:44:49,188 --> 01:44:53,660
Senator, you promised me a hearing.
You didn't even look at the FBI reports.

1845
01:44:53,860 --> 01:44:58,832
When you were my guest at the Tangiers
Hotel, didn't you promise me a fair hearing?

1846
01:44:59,032 --> 01:45:02,502
SENATOR: I was never your guest.
SAM: Never my guest? I never comped you?

1847
01:45:02,702 --> 01:45:04,904
I don't comp you
at least three times a month?

1848
01:45:05,104 --> 01:45:07,373
I'd like to answer that at this time.

1849
01:45:07,573 --> 01:45:10,877
Mr. Rothstein is being very typical
to this point. He's lying.

1850
01:45:11,077 --> 01:45:14,981
The only time I was at the Tangiers
was a dinner with Barney Greenstein.

1851
01:45:15,181 --> 01:45:17,750
Was I at the dinner?
SENATOR: You were wandering around.

SENATOR: You were wandering.

SENATOR: You were in the building.
SAM: I was in the building?

1854
01:45:24,257 --> 01:45:28,595
You know damn well I was there.
You swore I would have a fair hearing.

1855
01:45:28,795 --> 01:45:31,651
Did you not?

1856
01:45:32,732 --> 01:45:36,620
Tell me I was at least at the dinner.
Allow me that much.

SAM: Give me that much at least!

A routine licensing hearing
turned into bedlam yesterday...

1860
01:45:47,747 --> 01:45:51,084
when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino
executive, Sam "Ace" Rothstein...

1861
01:45:51,284 --> 01:45:54,187
accused top gaming officials of corruption.

1862
01:45:54,387 --> 01:45:57,123
...promised me a fair hearing
when you were comped at my hotel?

1863
01:45:57,323 --> 01:46:00,760
And you asked for copies of your bill
to put on your expense account.

1864
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:03,897
In a wild outburst that followed his gaming
license denial...

1865
01:46:04,097 --> 01:46:04,663
Bullshit!

1866
01:46:04,863 --> 01:46:06,299
...Rothstein followed several...

1867
01:46:06,499 --> 01:46:10,650
stunned commissioners into the hallway
where he continued his harangue...

1868
01:46:10,744 --> 01:46:13,235
until his own lawyers and friends
urged him to leave.

1869

of running Tangiers without a license...

if someone with Rothstein's history...

a top gaming post.

He knows all those guys he yelled at
are friends of ours.

01:46:41,601 --> 01:46:43,836
What's the matter with him,
making all this mess?

1879
01:46:44,036 --> 01:46:46,239
Maybe he could run things
with another job title.

1880
01:46:46,439 --> 01:46:48,841
Won't be the best,
but what are we gonna do?

quiet. Let him hide upstairs in the office.

Pat Webb too seriously.

1911
01:48:52,898 --> 01:48:56,402
I recently challenged him to a debate
on this program, and he declined.

1912

What are you worried about, Pat?
You don't have to send me any questions.

taking his lawsuit to the Supreme Court.

He really must be crazy.
He's gonna go to Washington with this?

He's out of his fucking mind.

1918
01:49:18,697 --> 01:49:21,828
It's a pity we have such hypocrisy.
Some people do what they want.

1919
01:49:22,028 --> 01:49:24,797
Other people have to pay
through the nose. Such is life.

Andy, go see him. Tell him
maybe it's time he should quit.

1921
01:49:36,008 --> 01:49:38,611
SAM: First, what they did
was totally unconstitutional.

1922
01:49:38,811 --> 01:49:42,415
SAM: We're on the list to be heard before
the U.S. Supreme Court.

1923
01:49:42,615 --> 01:49:44,784
These guys don't care
about the Supreme Court.

1924
01:49:44,984 --> 01:49:47,887
They want things to quiet down.
They want you to walk away.

1925
01:49:48,087 --> 01:49:53,025
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious.
Don't you see what's at stake?

1926
01:49:53,225 --> 01:49:56,028
The old man said maybe
your friend should give in.

1927
01:49:56,228 --> 01:49:58,931
When the old man says "maybe,"
that's like a papal bull.

1928
01:49:59,131 --> 01:50:01,868
Not only should you quit, you should run.

1929
01:50:02,068 --> 01:50:07,074
Every time they mention my name
in the papers, they mention Nicky, too.

1930
01:50:07,166 --> 01:50:08,957
How the fuck does that help?

1931
01:50:09,008 --> 01:50:11,377
The heat he brought down is murder.

1932
01:50:11,577 --> 01:50:14,039
The police department was cooperative.

1933
01:50:14,174 --> 01:50:16,182
They're pissed off.
Nobody can make a move anymore.

1934
01:50:16,382 --> 01:50:17,550
What do you do about that?

1935
01:50:17,750 --> 01:50:20,686
-What are you proposing?
-I don't know. He doesn't listen to me.

1936
01:50:20,886 --> 01:50:23,656
Maybe he should get lost for a while.
Would that be so bad?

1937
01:50:23,856 --> 01:50:26,973
-They ain't sending Nicky nowhere.
-If he took a break...

1938
01:50:27,104 --> 01:50:28,528
it would give everybody time to maneuver.

1939
01:50:28,728 --> 01:50:33,307
I would forget about the maneuver.
I would just get out.

[Sighs]

1941
01:50:36,769 --> 01:50:38,480
I can't do that.

1942
01:50:39,105 --> 01:50:43,342
SAM: Of course, as soon as Andy got home,
Nicky heard about our talk in the car.

1943
01:50:43,542 --> 01:50:46,993
Next morning, bright and early,
I get the call.

1944
01:50:47,179 --> 01:50:49,549
I've got to do some shopping. Want to go?

1945
01:50:49,749 --> 01:50:51,884
SAM: Getting a call from Nicky
wasn't easy anymore.

1946
01:50:52,084 --> 01:50:55,087
Even the codes didn't work.
So we figured out another act.

1947
01:50:55,287 --> 01:50:59,725
If a phone's tapped, the Feds can only
listen in on the stuff involving crimes.

1948
01:50:59,925 --> 01:51:03,162
On routine calls, they have
to click off after a few minutes.

his hero sandwich was a gun.
