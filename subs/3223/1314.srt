Now, I couldn't be in there all the time,

Good evening. Our lead story.

51
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:14,950
ENCOM CEO and video game icon Kevin Flynn has disappeared.

52
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:18,081
He was best known for designing Tron and Space Paranoids,

53
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,921
the two bestselling video games in history.

54
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:24,155
Flynn took ownership of ENCOM in 1982

55
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,631
as the company skyrocketed to the top of the tech industry.

56
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:32,034
But things changed in 1985 with the untimely death of Flynn's wife,

57
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:34,629
the mother of his young son, Sam.

58
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,709
Recently, ENCOM board members

59
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,038
have been troubled by reports

60
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:41,113
of Flynn's erratic, even obsessive, behavior.

61
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:44,911
With Flynn missing, the company is now in chaos.

62
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,213
This afternoon, ENCOM's board

63
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,483
moved to seize control from Flynn's partner, Alan Bradley,

64
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,559
vowing to return the company to profitability.

65
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,863
Loyal to the end, Bradley maintains his belief that Flynn is not missing

66
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,559
and is instead pursuing his dream of

67
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:05,104
"a digital frontier to reshape the human condition."

Kevin Flynn may have simply run away.

Alan came over.

514
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:25,683
Bradley.

515
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:28,587
Yeah. He got your page.

516
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:31,957
I found your office under the arcade.

517
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:34,831
Page...

518
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:37,228
Oh, the page.

519
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:40,161
Of course.

520
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:46,334
Clu had him on the light cycle grid.

00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:48,570
I intervened.

Oh.

523
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:53,405
Dinner soon.

524
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:56,785
We'll talk then.

00:51:10,768 --> 00:51:13,965
He never thought he'd see you again.

526
00:51:16,206 --> 00:51:17,867
Yeah.

527
00:51:25,049 --> 00:51:29,383
Vintage. Flynn built it many cycles ago for the games.

His patience usually beats out my more aggressive strategy.

533
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:13,659
Flynn shared them with me.

534
00:52:13,764 --> 00:52:15,561
I've read them all.

535
00:52:15,766 --> 00:52:18,462
Oh. Light reading.

00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:20,963

00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:23,266
Dostoyevsky.

538
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:25,898
I-Ching. Journey Without Goal.

539
00:52:26,844 --> 00:52:29,176
Must have a killer ending.

540
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:31,440
Flynn is teaching me about the art of the selfless,

541
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:36,247
about removing oneself from the equation.

542
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:41,154
But between you and me, Jules Verne is my favorite.

543
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:44,850
- Do you know Jules Verne?    - Sure.

544

What's he like?

Why I never came home.

I'm sure you've figured it out by now, I was coming here.

But I also had you.

00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,196
I had ENCOM. I couldn't be in here all the time.

572

none of it meant a thing.

I'd been living in a hall of mirrors.

605

I didn't send any page.

It was Clu.

Clu sent that page. That's why you're here.

676
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:10,132
This is all his design. He wanted a new piece

on the board to change the game!

With you, he got more than he ever dreamed.

This is precisely what he wants. Us together heading for the portal.

680
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:24,306
It's his game now. The only way to win is not to play.

Well, that's a hell of a way to live.

Good night, Sam.

688

How can he be so afraid of his own creation?

689
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:27,670
I mean, he built Clu. Why doesn't he just end him?

690
01:02:28,978 --> 01:02:31,037
He could, but it would require reintegration.

691

Yeah, all right.

692

I'm going to find Alan and we'll figure this thing out from the other side.

It is.

844
01:19:10,812 --> 01:19:12,439
I'm sorry. I know I messed up.

845
01:19:14,649 --> 01:19:15,638
We can go back.

846
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:18,447
- I can go back.    - No, we stay together.

- Dad, I can do this.    - You've done enough already!

Sam, you're really...

849
01:19:31,633 --> 01:19:33,863
You're messing with my Zen thing, man.

850
01:19:36,471 --> 01:19:37,802
She's stable.

851
01:19:38,974 --> 01:19:42,239
- SAM: So what do we do now?    - I don't know. Nothing.

852
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:45,179
We do nothing.

853
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:47,271
Be still.

854
01:19:49,918 --> 01:19:51,510
Wait.

855
01:19:59,294 --> 01:20:02,127
You ever jump a freight train?

01:20:03,331 --> 01:20:04,320
Huh?

857
01:20:04,433 --> 01:20:07,596
We do it your way. Full-on sprint to the portal.

858
01:20:07,702 --> 01:20:09,567
If we beat Clu there, we have a chance.

859
01:20:09,671 --> 01:20:10,968
Let's get her out of here.

860
01:20:29,925 --> 01:20:31,654
This'll take us there.

861
01:20:58,587 --> 01:21:01,055
- Is she gonna make it?    - I don't know.

862
01:21:01,156 --> 01:21:03,784
I've got to identify the damaged code.

863
01:21:03,892 --> 01:21:07,419
The sequencing is just enormously complex.

864
01:21:08,563 --> 01:21:13,227
- SAM: But didn't you write it?    - Some of it. The rest of it is just

beyond me.

866
01:21:19,908 --> 01:21:22,240
She's an ISO.

867
01:21:22,344 --> 01:21:24,744
KEVIN: Yeah. The last ISO.

868
01:21:27,082 --> 01:21:28,447
SAM: All this time,

869
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:30,882
you were just protecting her.

870
01:21:30,986 --> 01:21:34,979
KEVIN: She's the miracle, man. Everything I ever worked for.

"A digital frontier to reshape the human condition."

Yeah.

01:21:53,575 --> 01:21:55,975
(LAUGHS) Check that out.

876
01:22:04,152 --> 01:22:06,245
She risked herself for me.

877
01:22:08,223 --> 01:22:10,521
Some things are worth the risk.

878
01:22:24,139 --> 01:22:26,039
KEVIN: Look at this.

879
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:32,505
Now, that is impressive if I do say so myself. Huh?

880
01:22:33,982 --> 01:22:37,145
Come on, it's gonna take a while for her system to reboot.

881
01:22:37,252 --> 01:22:40,415
Now it's time for you to tell me a story.

882

CLU: The boy and Flynn are gone.

Cell phones, online dating, Wi-Fi.

890

- KEVIN: What's Wi-Fi?    - Wireless interlinking.

891
01:23:34,476 --> 01:23:37,309
- Of digital devices?    - Yeah.

892
01:23:37,579 --> 01:23:40,810
Hmm. I thought of that in '85.

- I assume that...    - Yeah.

01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:53,785
Oh.

897
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:57,195
Mac when I was 12

898
01:23:57,299 --> 01:24:00,200
and Gram five years later.

899
01:24:03,004 --> 01:24:06,838
You remember that night when you didn't come home?

900
01:24:06,941 --> 01:24:08,135
- Well...    - You said...

901
01:24:08,243 --> 01:24:10,302
I said I'd show you the Grid.

902
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:14,678
You should have seen this place back then.

903
01:24:15,650 --> 01:24:20,952
I couldn't wait to show it to you. Could not wait.

904
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:23,547

No, no, he...

906
01:24:27,162 --> 01:24:29,824
He's me. I screwed it up.

908
01:24:35,537 --> 01:24:39,200
Chasing after what was right in front of me.

Right in front of me.

910

911
01:24:46,348 --> 01:24:48,111
It's incredible.

Sam,

913
01:24:50,552 --> 01:24:53,817

01:25:14,275 --> 01:25:18,211
- Yeah, well, I'm fixing her up.    - You busted my bike?

919
01:25:18,313 --> 01:25:23,979
Twenty years in the shed, no tarp. I mean, she needed a little love.

01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:27,144
How does she run?

922
01:25:27,255 --> 01:25:31,214
Well, when I'm done, better than ever.

923
01:25:32,494 --> 01:25:34,985
Well, man, I'd like to see that.

924
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:38,154
You will.

925
01:25:41,569 --> 01:25:42,593
Here.

926
01:25:42,937 --> 01:25:45,371
She's rebooting. Give her this.

927
01:25:45,473 --> 01:25:49,273
The old man's gonna knock on the sky, listen to the sound.

929
01:26:17,639 --> 01:26:20,733
ah, everything changed.

01:26:21,309 --> 01:26:23,869
I've never seen anything quite like it.

931
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:26,947
The awe was

932
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:29,248
palpable.

933
01:26:30,852 --> 01:26:33,082
- Was it?    - I presume

934
01:26:33,755 --> 01:26:36,918
our understanding is still valid?

935
01:26:38,493 --> 01:26:40,586
Control of the city?

936
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:44,165
A sizeable request, I know.

937
01:26:44,265 --> 01:26:47,098
But seemingly fitting compensation.

938
01:26:47,769 --> 01:26:49,134
Don't you think?

939
01:26:50,572 --> 01:26:54,064
How long have you been searching for this, Clu?

940
01:26:55,243 --> 01:26:57,803
About 1 ,000 cycles. No?

941
01:26:58,646 --> 01:27:01,706

But there's something else, too.

946
01:27:16,030 --> 01:27:17,156
Isn't there?

947
01:27:17,265 --> 01:27:19,130
I've heard the chatter

948
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:22,601
about this private initiative.

01:27:32,146 --> 01:27:35,172
I realize that our alliance is,

01:27:36,784 --> 01:27:38,251
uneasy.

952
01:27:38,353 --> 01:27:40,321
But always necessary.

953
01:27:42,123 --> 01:27:43,750
You know you need me

954
01:27:43,892 --> 01:27:45,860
right where I am.

01:27:47,996 --> 01:27:50,191
Of course you're right.

Once I get out, I can shut him down.

I should never have sent you to Zuse. It was a mistake.

It's okay. I've made a few myself.

01:28:39,814 --> 01:28:41,406
Where is he?

969
01:28:42,383 --> 01:28:45,216
SAM: I think he's knocking on the sky.

Yeah.

It's okay.

I know.

975
01:29:12,814 --> 01:29:15,112
QUORRA: It was during the Purge.

976
01:29:16,284 --> 01:29:18,218
Clu was relentless.

977
01:29:18,620 --> 01:29:21,953
The Black Guard were executing ISOs in the streets.

978
01:29:23,124 --> 01:29:25,854
Everyone I knew disappeared.

979
01:29:28,529 --> 01:29:30,554
Then they came for me.

980
01:29:33,334 --> 01:29:35,234
So I ran.

981
01:29:36,337 --> 01:29:39,602
A sympathetic program smuggled me out of the city.

982
01:29:39,707 --> 01:29:42,198
But soon they had me surrounded.

983
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:44,301
I prepared for the end.

984
01:29:44,512 --> 01:29:46,844
And just as everything was going dark,

985
01:29:47,482 --> 01:29:50,417
I felt a hand on my shoulder.

986
01:29:53,154 --> 01:29:55,179
And when I opened my eyes,

987
01:29:56,658 --> 01:30:01,027
standing above me was the Creator.

Your father.

989
01:30:07,068 --> 01:30:08,695
He saved me.

I guess you could say I'm a rescue.

QUORRA: It used to let us know that Flynn was here.

993
01:30:40,401 --> 01:30:42,733
It became the symbol of something bigger,

01:47:47,894 --> 01:47:49,418
(SCREAMS)

1160
01:47:57,304 --> 01:47:59,772
That's it. It's over.

1161
01:48:00,741 --> 01:48:01,765
It's over!

1162
01:48:02,409 --> 01:48:03,740
(LAUGHS)

1163
01:48:03,910 --> 01:48:05,707
QUORRA: Whoo!

1164
01:48:13,220 --> 01:48:16,348
Quorra, there's something I need you to do.

1165
01:49:05,071 --> 01:49:06,971
Let's get you home, Dad.

1166
01:49:11,044 --> 01:49:12,341
There it is.

1167
01:49:12,979 --> 01:49:17,211
- Take her down.    - Hang on. This could be rough.

1168
01:50:09,402 --> 01:50:11,597
This is mine.

1169
01:50:16,810 --> 01:50:18,903
I had a feeling you'd be here!

1170
01:50:19,045 --> 01:50:22,845
(LAUGHS) The cycles haven't been kind, have they?

1171
01:50:23,783 --> 01:50:26,047
Oh, you don't look so bad.

1172
01:50:27,354 --> 01:50:30,915
I did everything. Everything you ever asked.

1173
01:50:31,524 --> 01:50:33,253
I know you did.

1174
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:36,659
- CLU: I executed the plan!    - As you saw it.

1175
01:50:36,796 --> 01:50:41,961
You... You promised that we would change the world together.

1176
01:50:42,369 --> 01:50:44,496
- You broke your promise.    - I know.

1177
01:50:44,771 --> 01:50:46,136
I understand that now.

1178
01:50:46,239 --> 01:50:49,675
I took this system to its maximum potential.

1179
01:50:49,776 --> 01:50:51,903
I created the perfect system!

1180
01:50:52,012 --> 01:50:55,743
The thing about perfection is that it's unknowable.

1181
01:50:56,917 --> 01:51:01,513
It's impossible but it's also right in front of us all the time.

1182
01:51:01,655 --> 01:51:05,284
You wouldn't know that because I didn't when I created you.

1183
01:51:07,093 --> 01:51:08,822
I'm sorry, Clu.

1184
01:51:10,964 --> 01:51:13,364
I'm sorry.

1185
01:51:25,812 --> 01:51:26,870
(YELLS)

1186
01:51:35,088 --> 01:51:36,282
Go.

1187
01:51:49,736 --> 01:51:50,828
Clu!

1188
01:51:51,805 --> 01:51:54,069
Remember what you came for.

1189
01:52:08,088 --> 01:52:09,077
Dad!

1190
01:52:09,222 --> 01:52:10,689
CLU: You knew I'd beat you.

1191
01:52:10,857 --> 01:52:13,883
And still you did all this? For him.

1192
01:52:20,066 --> 01:52:21,294
No.

1193
01:52:26,906 --> 01:52:28,168
No!

1194
01:52:28,274 --> 01:52:29,605
Why?

1195
01:52:31,311 --> 01:52:32,676
He's my son.

1196
01:52:39,052 --> 01:52:40,041
Go!

1197
01:52:45,925 --> 01:52:46,983
Dad!

1198
01:52:53,566 --> 01:52:55,693
Sam! It's time!

1199
01:52:55,969 --> 01:52:57,095
No!

1200
01:52:57,504 --> 01:53:00,234
Sam, it's what he wants.

1201
01:53:02,308 --> 01:53:04,208
I'm not leaving you!

1202
01:53:04,644 --> 01:53:06,111
Take her!

1203
01:53:17,590 --> 01:53:19,148
Yes!

1204
01:53:46,853 --> 01:53:48,514
Goodbye, kiddo.

1205
01:54:17,183 --> 01:54:19,151
(GROANS)

1206
01:54:19,853 --> 01:54:21,718
No!

1207
01:55:32,659 --> 01:55:34,456
SAM: Al?

1208
01:55:38,898 --> 01:55:40,695
ALAN: You paged me?

1209
01:55:41,234 --> 01:55:42,861
Yeah.

1210
01:55:43,670 --> 01:55:45,934
I need you at ENCOM at 8:00 a.m.

1211
01:55:47,907 --> 01:55:49,397
What about the board?

1212
01:55:51,077 --> 01:55:52,977
You're chairman now.

1213
01:55:55,315 --> 01:55:57,749
I'm taking the company back, Alan.

1214
01:56:01,854 --> 01:56:03,048
Oh, and...

1215
01:56:04,357 --> 01:56:05,984
You were right.

1216
01:56:07,694 --> 01:56:09,093
About what?

1217
01:56:10,763 --> 01:56:12,321
About everything.

1218
01:56:37,223 --> 01:56:38,485
QUORRA: What's next, Sam?

1219
01:56:44,297 --> 01:56:47,664
I guess we're supposed to change the world.

1220
01:56:51,438 --> 01:56:54,134
Come on. I wanna show you something.
