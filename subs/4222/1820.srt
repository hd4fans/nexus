1
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,300
<font color="#4096d1">海貍</font>

2
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:35,739
這就是沃特·布萊克
This is a picture of Walter Black,

3
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,471
一個陷入絕望的抑鬱癥患者
a hopelessly depressed individual.

4
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,942
而在他內心某處 住著一個曾經墜入愛河
Somewhere inside him is a man who fell in love,

5
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,209
組建起美滿家庭
who started a family...

6
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:49,650
接著我醒了
And then I woke up.

7
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:52,113
...事業有成的人
...who ran a successful company.

8
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,727
但這個人卻已經消失不見了
That man has gone missing.

9
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,521
不管他怎樣努力
No matter what he's tried,

10
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,763
用盡一切辦法
and he's tried everything,

11
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,732
沃特對他的離去卻束手無策
Walter can't seem to bring him back.

12
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:10,970
就好像他實際上已經死了
It's as if he's died

13
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,806
卻沒能帶上他的肉體一起離開
but hasn't had the good sense to take his body with him.

14
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:18,472
所以大部分的時間他都用來睡覺
So, mostly, what he does is sleep.

15
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:28,652
他父親曾經引以為傲的玩具公司的股份
Shares in his father's once-proud toy company

16
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:31,457
如今卻和沃特的感受一樣 變得一文不值
are now almost as worthless as Walter feels.

17
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:36,525
他那好像節日賀卡一樣美滿幸福的家庭
His family used to resemble something out of a holiday greeting card

18
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:39,729
現在卻充滿了無休止的哀傷
but now seems to be in perpetual mourning.

19
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,502
他最小的孩子亨利已經成為老師口中的"獨行俠"
Henry, his youngest, has become what his teachers call "solitary. "

20
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,973
總有一天他會成為隱形人
He'd like to become invisible one day

21
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,640
而不僅僅是被他親生父親忽視
instead of merely unnoticed by his own father.

22
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:54,948
而珀特 他的大兒子
And, Porter, his eldest?

23
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:58,787
害怕會變得像他父親那樣
Well, he's terrified of becoming just like his father.

24
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:03,788
他的任務? 就是記錄他倆之間每個可怕的相似點
His mission? To catalog every dreaded similarity that links them.

25
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:05,585
每一次咬嘴唇
Every lip bite.

26
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:08,792
每一次把脖子弄得吱嘎響 每一次無意識的行為
Every neck crack. Every involuntary behavior.

27
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,997
他決心一個一個地將它們抹去
He plans to erase them one by one.

28
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:17,936
妻子梅勒迪斯埋首於她的工程事務
His wife, Meredith, has hidden herself behind her engineering work

29
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:21,945
晚上與東京的電話會議 以及雲霄飛車的設計工作
and nighttime conference calls to Tokyo and roller coaster designs.

30
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,974
任何能讓她擺脫丈夫不在身邊 這一事實的事
Anything to drown out the reality of an absent husband.

31
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:29,235
沃特的抑鬱癥就像一滴墨汁 
Walter's depression is an ink 

32
00:03:29,235 --> 00:03:31,415
影響著所有他遇到的事
that stains everything it touches.

33
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,487
像一個黑洞 吞噬他身邊所有的人
A black hole that swallows all who get near.

34
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,926
他們都在等待著他醒過來
They've all been waiting for him to wake up,

35
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:43,590
重新振作起來
to snap out of it,

36
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,660
但他遲遲不見好轉
but he hasn't.

37
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:51,502
所以 梅勒迪斯做了最後唯一能做的
So, Meredith does the only thing left to do

38
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:55,005
說了最後唯一能說的
and says the only thing left to say.

39
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,204
再見
Goodbye.

40
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,628
賈裡德 你這科都要掛了
Jared, you're failing this class.

41
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,339
你真覺得你突然交出一份滿分的論文 
Do you honestly think you can suddenly hand in an "A" paper 

42
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:21,332
你能逃之夭夭?
and get away with it?

43
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:22,395
那赫克托呢?
What about Hector?

44
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,557
你幫他在家庭發展上拿到了A
You got him an "A" in Family Development.

45
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:28,542
聽著 我從來沒有幫赫克托寫過東西 明白了嗎?
Look, I've never written anything for Hector. All right?

46
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,309
如果他是那麼和你說的 他就是個騙子
If he told you differently, he's a liar.

47
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:34,243
想想 即使我真幫他寫了論文
Hypothetically, had I written him something,

48
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,514
就得繼續不斷把他的分數提高
we would have raised his grades incrementally.

49
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:40,890
如果真是這樣 那麼他最後才會拿到A
And if that happened, then, yes, he might have turned in an "A" paper.

50
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,928
在他經常掛掉的課上 拿到B就算不錯了
He might even be making a "B" in a class that he used to be failing.

51
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:46,409
所以 要是有人想讓我幫忙 
So, if someone wanted me to do this, 

52
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:47,932
那就得照著他們的樣子辦事
and do it as them,

53
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:50,271
以他們的口吻 在他們的能力之內
in their voice and at their skill level,

54
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,061
我會告訴他們要不按我說的辦
I would say that they could either do it my way

55
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,539
要不試試你的運氣 從網上買幾篇廢紙
or take your chances buying some piece of shit off the Internet.

56
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:59,917
每次200?      要是嫌多就自己寫去
$200 every time?        If it's too much, write it yourself.

57
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,269
比大麻還貴
More than I pay for weed.

58
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,800
(體育館 明天4點)

59
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,277
對不起 孩子
Sorry, buddy.

60
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:46,851
你又沒看到我
You passed me again.

61
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,421
我知道 寶貝 我那是在找你啊
I know, honey. I was looking.

62
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,366
今天怎麼樣?
How was your day?

63
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:58,068
和別人說話了嗎?
Did you talk to anyone?

64
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,969
我想是的
I guess.

65
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,904
新朋友還是老朋友?
A new person or an old person?

66
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:04,564
新的
New.

67
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,803
很好 你們都說了什麼呢?
Good. What did you talk about?

68
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,301
他說我是慫蛋
He said I was a ball-licker.

69
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:13,998
我說我不是 他就把我扔進垃圾箱裡了
I told him I wasn't, and he threw me in the dumpster.

70
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:16,075
什麼
What?

71
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:19,486
你告訴老師了嗎?
Did you tell your teacher?

72
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,828
是她把我從垃圾箱裡弄出來的
She got me out of the dumpster.

73
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:29,495
這肯定有些誤會
Well, this must be some kind of misunderstanding,

74
00:06:29,495 --> 00:06:32,927
我們必須要調解糾正他們的...
and we just have to realign or correct their...

75
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,936
我會和老師談談
I'll talk to the teacher.

76
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:38,031
爸爸走了?
Is Dad gone?

77
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:42,376
不 他沒離開 寶貝
No. He's not gone, honey.

78
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,127
只是我們都覺得不在一起生活比較好
We just agreed that it's better if we don't live together anymore. 

79
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,985
知道嗎?
Okay?

80
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,738
你想在海的另一邊尋找什麼 孩子
What do you look for beyond the sea, Grasshopper?

81
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:25,912
知之甚少的那部分自我
That part of me which I know little of.

82
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:29,353
我的前世
The past of which I was born.

83
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:31,752
那麼有一天 你會找到它的
Then, some day, you must seek it.

84
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:35,058
尋求過去是對的嗎? 波大師
Is it good to seek the past, Master Po?

85
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:38,895
它不會擾亂現在嗎?
Does it not rob the present?

86
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:42,296
如果一個人總是沉溺在過去 他就會毀掉現在
If a man dwells on the past, then he robs the present.

87
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:46,769
但是如果忽視過去 那麼他則會毀掉未來
But if a man ignores the past, he may rob the future.

88
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,953
命運的種子需要細心呵護 
The seeds of our destiny are nurtured...

89
00:08:49,953 --> 00:08:51,372
這就是它們的美好之處 孩子
That's beautiful, Grasshopper.

90
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,775
來 喝酒
Here. Here you go.

91
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,412
你不喝
You moved.

92
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,422
嘿!
Oi!

93
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,419
你知道 既然我們現在正做些改變
You know, since we're making changes around here,

94
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,517
也許你需要請個水管工之類的
maybe you want to get, like, a plumber or something.

95
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,729
我是說這地方都快塌了
I mean, this place is falling apart.

96
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:53,492
那實在太糟了 
Well, that's too bad, 

97
00:10:53,492 --> 00:10:56,626
我們對此實在沒什麼辦法 不是嗎?
because there's really not much we can do about it, is there?

98
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:01,169
哇哦 放鬆點 我站在你這邊 
Whoa, relax. I'm on your side, okay. 

99
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:02,405
我很高興你把他踢出去了
I'm glad you kicked him out.

100
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:07,241
這只是餐桌上的討論而已
I'm just saying this whole eating-at-the-table thing together.

101
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:10,337
我的意思是 你打算讓他在外面多久?
I mean, that's... How long do you expect us to keep that up?

102
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,309
不知道 珀特
I don't know, Porter.

103
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:15,374
也許等到我們重新學會相互尊重?
Maybe until we start respecting each other again?

104
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:20,515
也許等到我們開始關心對方今天過得怎麼樣
You know, maybe when we start asking each other how was our day

105
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,024
把盤子清理乾淨的時候
and clearing out the dishes...

106
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,254
也許我也該制定一張路線圖
Maybe I should get a paper route, too.

107
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,862
接著 我要猜這個數字
Then I'm going to guess the number.

108
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:34,067
如果我才對了 我們就開始小貓咪的故事
If I guess right, we do the kitten story.

109
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:37,538
今晚有兩個故事 實在太頭疼了
Two big stories to get to tonight, unfortunately...

110
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:45,677
醒醒
Wake up.

111
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,711
起來 你個沒用的笨蛋
Wake up, you worthless sod.

112
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:56,754
天吶 瞧瞧你的樣子
Bloody hell. Look at you.

113
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:01,689
醉得不省人事 被電視機壓在下面
Stone-drunk and flattened by a television.

114
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:09,996
你真是在給自己寫訃告啊 沃特
That's quite an obituary you're working up for yourself, Walter.

115
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:26,983
走開
Leave me alone.

116
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:32,860
不不不不 我才不要走 你不想我走開的
No. Can't do that. You don't want that.

117
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:38,733
因為我是唯一一個真正瞭解你內心感受的人
'Cause I'm the only one what knows how you really feel.

118
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,472
人人都需要個朋友 沃特
Everybody needs a friend, Walter.

119
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,505
我就是你的朋友
And you've got me.

120
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:52,546
就是因為這你把那些自我救贖的書讀了個遍
That's why you read all them useless self-help books.

121
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:59,221
什麼《心情雞湯》《正向思考》《友情秘訣》
Chicken Soup, Positive Thinking, How to Win Friends.

122
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:03,091
哪本書教你把電視往自己腦袋上砸的?
Which one has the chapter about dropping the telly on your head?

123
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,724
我病了
I'm sick.

124
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:09,825
的確 沃特 這點我們達成共識
Yeah, Walt. On that, we agree.

125
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,904
問題是 你想不想好起來?
The question is, do you want to get better?

126
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,772
我做不到
I can't.

127
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,817
是啊是啊是啊 你得了抑鬱癥 哦 是啊
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're depressed. Yeah.

128
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:29,876
昏昏沉沉 鬱鬱寡歡
Lethargic. Anhedonia.

129
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:31,582
醒醒吧!
Wake up!

130
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:36,059
那些書還有小藥片 那都是些棉花糖
Books and pills. They're cotton candy.

131
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:39,329
你看太多家居裝飾的節目
You've seen too many home-improvement shows.

132
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,386
以至於你真覺得僅僅靠
You think you can just

133
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:43,865
重新刷個漆 重新挪一下家俱的位置
splash up some paint and rearrange the furniture,

134
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,489
接著所有的一切都會恢復正常
and everything will be all right.

135
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:51,232
你想不想做些改變? 我是說 真正的改變?
You want things to change? I mean, really change?

136
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:55,007
你要忘了那些家居裝潢的想法 沃特
You gotta forget about home improvement, Walter.

137
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:59,179
你該去把這該死的房子炸掉
You have gotta blow up the whole bloody building.

138
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:10,491
那麼你要怎麼做呢? 沃特
What are you gonna do, Walter?

139
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:13,888
炸了它      大聲點!
Blow it up.        Louder!

140
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,365
炸了它      大聲點!
Blow it up.        Louder!

141
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:21,504
炸了它! 把他媽的炸了! 炸了它! 炸了它!
Blow it up! Blow it the fuck up! Blow it up! Blow it up!

142
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,561
很好
Right.

143
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,497
太對了 夥計
Too right, mate.

144
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:27,107
你可以把它都炸了 再重新開始
You can blow it up. Start again.

145
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,313
你是誰?
Who are you?

146
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:38,970
我是海貍先生 我為拯救你那苦逼的生活而來
I'm the Beaver, Walter, and I'm here to save your goddamn life.

147
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:45,321
嗨
Hey.

148
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:48,555
抱歉 我一定又錯過他了 他擠進人群裡了
I'm sorry. I must have passed him again. He just blends in.

149
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,651
不 他父親早就把他接走了
No, his dad picked him up early.

150
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:52,157
沃特?
Walter?

151
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:57,103
他說他給你發了短信 你丈夫真是個與眾不同的人
He said he sent you a text. Your husband is quite a character.

152
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,021
媽媽 你真該來看看我們的傑作
Mom, you gotta see what we did.

153
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,087
好啊 你爸爸呢?      快來 我給你看
Okay. Where's your father?        Come on! I'll show you.

154
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,034
你把回憶存在裡面
You put your memory in it.

155
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,195
你從哪找到的?
Where'd you get that?

156
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,399
這是我們做的      你和你爸爸?
We made it.        You and your dad?

157
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,203
我和海貍先生
Me and the Beaver.

158
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,609
海貍先生?
The Beaver?

159
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,176
知道沃特把磨石機塞哪了嗎?
Any idea where Walter stuffed the power sander

160
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:44,016
兩年前你送他的那個聖誕禮物
you gave him two Christmases ago?

161
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:46,845
不知道?
No?

162
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,383
沒關係 我們能應付
No trouble. We'll make do.

163
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:52,485
沃特 那個口音和玩偶是怎麼回事?
Walter, what's with the accent and the puppet?

164
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,125
把東西給她      好
Give her the thing.        Right.

165
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,469
"你好 給你這張名片的人
"Hello. The person who handed you this card

166
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:05,532
"現在正處於一隻治癒玩偶的照顧中"
"is under the care of a prescription puppet. "

167
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,374
沃特 這到底是怎麼回事?
Walter, what the hell is this?

168
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:10,903
亨利 你去看看能不能找到我們剛才說的清漆
Henry, mate, go see if you can find that varnish we was talking about.

169
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,241
我會找到的!      謝謝 夥計!
I'll get it!        Thanks, mate!

170
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,717
你看完名片了?
Did you read the card?

171
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:20,080
是的 我...      看名片
Yes, I...         Read the card.

172
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,056
我已經...      看名片
I've...         Read the card.

173
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:27,582
"你好 給你這張名片的人 
"The person who handed you this card 

174
00:16:27,582 --> 00:16:30,598
"現在正處於一隻治癒玩偶的照顧中
"is under the care of a prescription puppet

175
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:34,368
"目的是為了在他自身和消極人格之間
"designed to help create a psychological distance between himself

176
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,668
"創造一個心理隔斷
"and the negative aspects of his personality.

177
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,208
"請你像正常一樣對他
"Please treat him as you normally would

178
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:41,744
"但是把注意力集中到玩偶身上 謝謝"
"but address yourself to the puppet. Thank you. "

179
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,801
就是這樣
There you go.

180
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:44,434
這是什麼玩笑麼?
Is this some kind of a joke?

181
00:16:44,434 --> 00:16:46,921
不 親愛的 這可不是什麼玩笑
No, hardly, love. Nothing funny about it.

182
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,384
別再擺弄那玩偶了!
Stop it with the puppet!

183
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,582
好吧 我很迷惑 沃特 我需要解釋 就現在
All right. I'm confused, Walter, and I need some answers right now.

184
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:02,140
他說如果我堅持這麼做 也許...
He said if I stick with it that maybe...

185
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,942
他? 誰說的?
He? Who said that?

186
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:05,824
梅西醫生
Dr. Macy.

187
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:09,032
梅西醫生? 你早就不去看他了
Dr. Macy? You quit seeing him.

188
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,702
好吧 我又回去了
Well, I went back.

189
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:18,107
那麼這算是某種康復療程?
So this is some kind of a program?

190
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:23,050
讓我來說 是的 梅勒迪斯 答案是 是的
I'll field that one. Yes, Meredith. The answer is yes.

191
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,219
就是這樣
That is exactly what it is.

192
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:26,483
我知道儘管這聽上去有點荒唐
I know it seems radical,

193
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,065
但是在沃特這種病例上 
but in cases like Walter's, 

194
00:17:28,065 --> 00:17:30,356
在這種其他方法都不起作用的病例上
cases where all else has been known to fail,

195
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,426
看得出來 它很有效果
it's proven quite effective.

196
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:37,166
但是想要他起作用 就需要你的全力支持
But if it's going to work, it's going to need your full support.

197
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:38,893
這在瑞典很流行
It's very big in Sweden.

198
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:42,294
我找不到
I couldn't find it.

199
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:43,738
啊 別擔心
Ah. No worries.

200
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:46,837
我還是自己找吧
I best be on me boy.

201
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,037
你不會離開 對吧?
You're not leaving, are you?

202
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,636
不用擔心 週末我會再回來
Don't worry. I'll come back this weekend, then.

203
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:53,205
但是你得留下來吃飯! 媽媽 讓他留下來吃飯吧!
But you have to stay for dinner! Mom, let him stay for dinner!

204
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:54,444
好吧 沒事
Look, it's all right.

205
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:57,077
我不需要      求你了 媽媽 讓他留下吃飯吧
I don't need to.        Please, Mom, let him stay for dinner.

206
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,087
我下個週末還會來的      拜託了
I'll come back this weekend, then.        Come on.

207
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:01,385
只是吃個飯 沒問題      求你了 媽媽
It's okay. Just for dinner.        Please, Mom.

208
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,261
耶!      那麼 好吧
Yeah!        Well, right, then.

209
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,914
讓我們把車庫整理一下 好讓我們去廚房搗亂
Let's tidy up the garage so we can mess up the kitchen.

210
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,828
來吧 不要碰鋒利的東西
Come on. Don't touch anything sharp.

211
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:14,795
嗨
Hey.

212
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:22,508
你找我來幹什麼?
What the hell am I doing here?

213
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,547
我需要你幫我寫點東西
I need you to write me something.

214
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:28,639
我早就知道 他以為我會跳進這個圈套?
I knew it. He thinks I'm going to fall for this?

215
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,096
誰?      默菲 或是別的
Who?        Mumphry, or whatever

216
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,052
副校長讓你來的
vice-principal sent you.

217
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,222
告訴他這是在侮辱我
Tell him I'm insulted.

218
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:40,281
嘿 你能不能等一下? 沒人派我來
Hey, will you hold on for a second? No one sent me.

219
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,121
我真的很需要幫助
I really need help.

220
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:46,115
聽著 你是畢業典禮的致辭人 好不好 績點4分
Look, you're the valedictorian, all right. You have a 4.0.

221
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,036
我還需要抄你的微積分答案
I copy off of you in calculus.

222
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,365
為什麼你還要我幫你寫論文?
Why would you want me to write you a paper?

223
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:51,430
不是論文
It's not a paper.

224
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:55,339
是我的畢業演講
It's my graduation speech.

225
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:58,998
省省吧 沒人會在乎那些事
Save your money. No one gives a shit about those things.

226
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,215
好吧 但是我媽媽會 所以...
Yeah, well, my mom will. So...

227
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,945
我不是在說你當槍手幫別人寫論文
Not that I'm saying that you write other people's papers for them,

228
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,451
但如果真是你做的 
but if you did, 

229
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,021
我聽說你很擅長模仿他們口吻
I hear that you're really good at making yourself sound like them.

230
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,155
瞭解他們的想法 這就是我需要的
Getting inside their heads. That's what I need.

231
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:18,633
不行      為什麼?
No way.        Why?

232
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,070
對你那些厭食的拉拉隊友來說 
Because it's one thing for your little anorexia squad 

233
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,128
光看長相就能看透她們
to get by on their looks.

234
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:24,212
他們也就這點能耐了 
That's all they've got. 

235
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,809
但對於你這樣的人來說 根本就是自己懶得干
But for someone like you, it's just lazy.

236
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:29,568
站在
Hold on.

237
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:31,603
等等
Wait a minute.

238
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,039
這對你來說是因為懶得幹麼?
Does this look lazy to you?

239
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:38,795
懶得看那428頁
That is 428 pages of lazy.

240
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:40,892
如果不想收錢替我幹活 
And if you don't want to take my money 

241
00:19:40,892 --> 00:19:42,069
是因為等不及想看到我
because you're just dying to see me

242
00:19:42,068 --> 00:19:45,321
出醜的樣子 那麼算了
make an ass of myself, then that's fine.

243
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,421
但是不許罵我懶骨頭
But don't you dare call me lazy.

244
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,834
蠢貨
Douche.

245
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,071
謝謝 想要在你的沙拉裡來點橄欖麼?
Thank you very much. You want olives in your salad?

246
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,275
好的      給 看著
Yeah.        Here you go. Watch this.

247
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:11,009
還要麼?
Would you like some more?

248
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:16,199
這是...      他回來了 你好
What the...        There he is. Hello.

249
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,390
我的名片
My card.

250
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:23,404
很抱歉 你回來之前我們就開始了
We was afraid we'd have to start without you.

251
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:27,472
這是開玩笑吧 啊?
This is a joke, right?

252
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,658
不 孩子 這是個全新的開始
No, son, it's a fresh start.

253
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,469
你是瘋了嗎?
Have you completely lost your mind?

254
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,045
我知道這有點...      我沒問你 瘋子
I know it seems a bit...        I'm not talking to you, nut job.

255
00:20:34,045 --> 00:20:35,172
我在和媽媽說話
I'm talking to Mom.

256
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,982
你花了幾年時間才把他從這踢出去
It takes you years to get him out of here,

257
00:20:38,982 --> 00:20:40,848
結果第二天你就放他進來了 
and you let him come back the next night 

258
00:20:40,848 --> 00:20:42,842
還帶著個說話的玩偶?
with a talking hamster?

259
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,159
這種大公司在一夜之間倒閉是不可能的事
Failure on this scale doesn't happen overnight.

260
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,860
我還是不相信你們倆做了這個
Still I can't believe that you guys made that.

261
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:59,932
我是說 你從來...我的意思是 沃特從來...
I mean, you never... I mean, Walter never...

262
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:06,450
抱歉 我還並不是很明白我該怎麼和你講話
I'm sorry. I'm not quite sure how I'm supposed to address you.

263
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:08,206
噢 你幹得不錯 親愛的
Well, you're doing fine, love.

264
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:11,582
工具總是出現在你的聖誕採購單上
Well, tools were always on your Christmas list,

265
00:21:11,582 --> 00:21:14,846
但我不知道你竟然知道怎麼做東西
but I had no idea that you knew how to actually make anything.

266
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:16,783
他是只海貍 媽媽 他們天生就是幹這個的
He's a beaver, Mom. That's what they do.

267
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,321
噢 完全正確 夥計
Yeah. Spot on, mate.

268
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:22,587
但是你知道 沃特曾經的手藝也不懶
But, you know, Walter wasn't half-bad himself, at one time.

269
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,594
是嗎? 誰教他的?
Yeah? Who taught him?

270
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,924
我猜他自學成才
I suppose he taught himself.

271
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:29,222
他還像你這麼大的時候 小童子軍
He was about your age, yeah. Cub Scouts.

272
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,666
他本打算和他爸爸一起造一輛賽車去參加比賽
He and his pop were supposed to make a race car for a contest.

273
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:34,936
但是 他爸爸不在 所以他只能自己干
Except, his pop weren't around so he had to do it himself.

274
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,400
他爸爸去哪了?
Where was his dad?

275
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:45,613
他十分傷心 後來就出了一場車禍
He got very sad and he had an accident.

276
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:48,014
你是說躺在墓地裡的傑瑞爺爺?
You mean Grandpa Jerry from the graveyard?

277
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:51,581
對 不管怎麼樣 沃特擁有了爺爺的工具 
Right-o. Anyway, Walter had Grandpa's tools 

278
00:21:51,581 --> 00:21:53,054
但是不知道如何使用
but no clue how to use them.

279
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,619
所以 他最後做出的成果很糟糕
So, what he ended up making was so awful

280
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:58,644
看上去就好像他把一套輪胎
that it looked like he'd screwed a set of wheels 

281
00:21:58,644 --> 00:22:00,096
裝在了一堆狗屎上
onto a piece of dog crap.

282
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,196
你知道其他孩子怎麼叫它的嗎?
And you know what the other kids called it?

283
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:07,427
糞球 那還算好的了 夥計
The Turd. That was generous, mate.

284
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:11,639
有位女士因為它靠得太近了而大吐特吐
One lady threw up all over herself just 'cause it got close to her.

285
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,911
但是當他駛向比賽場...
But when it came to racing...

286
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:16,668
怎麼了?
What?

287
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,278
糞球所向匹敵 無人能擋
The Turd could not be beat.

288
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,708
太牛了      是啊
Sweet.        Yeah.

289
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:23,411
老爸?      怎麼了 夥計?
Dad?        Yeah, mate?

290
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:27,287
我們能造一個糞球麼?      當然 隨時可以
Can we make a Turd?        Yeah, anytime, mate.

291
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,053
你把它的樣子告訴我 我們就可造糞球了
You give the word, we'll make the Turd.

292
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:31,817
嗯
Yeah.

293
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:35,291
晚安 海貍先生
Good night, Beaver.

294
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:37,656
晚安 夥計
Good night, mate.

295
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:45,997
晚安
Good night.

296
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,540
晚安 海貍先生
Good night, Beaver.

297
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,517
喂?      諾拉
Hello?        Norah.

298
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:55,916
嘿 我是珀特
Hey, it's Porter.

299
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:00,619
聽著 之前我說的那些話...
Listen, what I said earlier...

300
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,319
那麼你到底要不要幫我?      當然
So, are you going to help me or not?        Yeah.

301
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:06,498
但是對這種事 
But for this sort of thing, 

302
00:23:06,498 --> 00:23:12,108
我得開價大概500塊?
I'm going to have to ask you for, like, $500?

303
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:13,692
成交
Done.

304
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:16,871
哇哦 1000塊你也成交嗎?
Wow. Would you have gone $1,000?

305
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,339
噢 當然      一百萬呢?
Oh, yeah.        How about a million?

306
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,007
你明天能過來一趟嗎?
Can you come by tomorrow?

307
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,652
好好好 那當然
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

308
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:30,383
我沒有...聽著 我...我們沒什麼交情 不是嗎?
You know, I didn't... Look, I... We're cool, right? I... I'm...

309
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,620
你從來都沒和我說過一個字 你知道 而且...
You've never even said a word to me, you know, and...

310
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:34,054
珀特?      而且我們也不像...
Porter?        And it's not like we

311
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:37,355
很瞭解對方還是什麼的...嗯?      明天過來
know each other or anything... Yeah.        Just come by tomorrow.

312
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:40,124
好吧      就這麼定了
Okay.        Okay.

313
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,196
晚安! 明天見
Good night! See you soon.

314
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,358
相信我 夥計 今天我們要還你自由
Trust me, mate. Today will set you free.

315
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:24,032
這究竟是什麼?
What the hell is this?

316
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:25,500
我不知道
I have no idea.

317
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,662
這是要裁員 不是嗎? 該死的中國
This is layoffs, isn't it? Goddamn China.

318
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:29,330
沒人會被辭退
Nobody's getting laid off.

319
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:32,330
好久不見?
Get rid of you lot?

320
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:34,478
我不能到處使喚人了 對嗎?
I'd have no one to boss around, yeah?

321
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:38,376
老闆清醒了 還帶了個朋友
The boss woke up and brought a friend.

322
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:44,216
我想我們得保持尊重 等布萊克先生告訴我們...
I think we should maintain some respect until Mr. Black tells us...

323
00:25:44,225 --> 00:25:45,210
大家早上好
Good morning, all.

324
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:49,089
我想你們都拿到那些名片了
I assume you all got the cards.

325
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,487
如果沒有 請允許我簡單解釋一下
If not, allow me to briefly explain.

326
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:57,661
沃特·布萊克兩年前上任這家公司的CEO
Walter Black ascended to CEO of this company two years ago.

327
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:01,027
不是因為什麼特殊的才能或是優點 
Not through any particular skill or merit, 

328
00:26:01,028 --> 00:26:03,196
只是沃特是繼承人
but because Walter was next in line

329
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:07,868
而不是站在那的資深副總
rather than our infinitely more qualified VP standing right here.

330
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:09,467
你好 親愛的
Hello, love.

331
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:14,130
沃特 嗯 還沒做好接手這工作的準備
It was a job Walter was, well, ill-prepared to handle.

332
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,250
基本上...
Basically, well...

333
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,212
沃特是個失敗者
Walter's been a loser.

334
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:27,069
這就是現在他退出 而讓我接手職位的原因
Which is why, as of now, he is resigning and putting me in charge.

335
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:29,573
那麼 在你們決定要把我扔到鐵軌上 
So, before you decide to run me out on a rail 

336
00:26:29,573 --> 00:26:31,392
把我燒死之前
with all the flaming torches and pitchforks,

337
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:33,075
給我五分鐘 聽我把話講完 
hear me out, give me five minutes, 

338
00:26:33,075 --> 00:26:37,601
之後要殺要剮悉聽尊便
then you may tear me to shreds, if you like.

339
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:42,441
首先 我將會取消對單個項目的管理
First, I will be ceding control of all individual projects

340
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,002
回到以前的團隊管理
back to the teams themselves.

341
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:45,412
也就是說你們自由了
That means you will be free

342
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:49,041
你們會回到一開始的本職工作
and entrusted to do the jobs you was hired to do in the first place.

343
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,108
你好 漢克
Hello, Hank.

344
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:54,000
其次 我們會重新整頓 恢復生氣 重新參展
Second, we will revamp, revitalize, re-launch

345
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:57,550
六周後的
at the International Game and Toy Manufacturers Expo

346
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:00,392
國際遊戲暨玩具廠商展覽會
in six weeks' time.

347
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:03,826
我明白你們對我的領導能力
Now, I know there's a very high degree of skepticism 

348
00:27:03,826 --> 00:27:05,992
有諸多質疑
about my ability to lead.

349
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:07,431
不是嗎?
Isn't that right?

350
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:10,871
一個中年老男人 他的手臂塞在我屁股裡
I mean, middle-aged man with his arm stuck up my bum. Right?

351
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:15,272
誰不會懷疑我呢? 不過我也會給你們以下選擇
Who wouldn't doubt me? But I'll make you the following deal.

352
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:19,975
給我兩周的時間 就兩周 兩周之後
You give me two weeks, just two, and at the end of that time,

353
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:23,281
任何人想要離開都會得到一筆豐厚的解雇賠償金
anyone who wants to resign will receive severance pay

354
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:25,582
還有一封漂亮的推薦信
and a glowing letter of recommendation.

355
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,818
一言為定 絕無例外      抱歉?
No questions asked, no exceptions.        Excuse me?

356
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,392
你到底是誰?
And who exactly are you supposed to be?

357
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:34,062
天吶 我忘記自我介紹了?
Bollocks. Did I forget to introduce myself?

358
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,532
你們可以叫我海貍先生
You may simply call me the Beaver.

359
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,400
太牛了
Impressive.

360
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:49,634
那麼 你需要瞭解什麼?
So, what do you need to know?

361
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:55,044
我想首先我得知道你要說些什麼?
Well, I guess the first thing is, what do you want to say?

362
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,886
這就是問題所在
Well, that's kind of the problem.

363
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:03,420
我是說 我的成績不錯 算是個人物 還有什麼?
I mean, I got good grades. Big deal. What do I know?

364
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:07,258
那你做這些事的時候你想別人怎麼看你?
Okay. Well, how do you want people to feel when you're done?

365
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:13,128
我覺得我只想著不要讓他們
I guess I just want them to feel not

366
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,399
失望
let down.

367
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,528
"不要失望"
"Not let down. "

368
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,336
這點很好
That's powerful.

369
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:22,104
"我很激動很興奮 你怎麼樣?"
"I'm excited, pumped. How are you doing?"

370
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,204
"我? 我從不讓人失望"
"Me? I'm not let down. "

371
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,280
我告訴過你我很挫的 所以我才需要你
I told you that I suck. This is why I need you.

372
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:31,877
好吧 你是啦啦隊長 出了名的急性子
Okay, well, you're a cheerleader, notorious hothead.

373
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:33,980
能說說你八年級是怎麼被開除的麼?
Could we talk about you getting expelled from the eighth grade?

374
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,717
你怎麼知道這事?
How did you find out about that?

375
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,188
有網絡無秘密
No secrets on the Internet.

376
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,720
你幹了什麼?
What did you do?

377
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:43,026
你偷了誰的百科全書?
Did you steal some encyclopedias?

378
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:45,125
吸煙?      不是
Chew some nicotine gum        No.

379
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,101
那是什麼? 嘲笑小胖墩?
What? Tease a fat kid?

380
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:48,626
住口
Shut up.

381
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:50,197
好吧 那麼究竟是什麼?
All right. So, what is it?

382
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,139
我正在標記
I was tagging.

383
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:58,075
標記?
Tagging?

384
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:00,910
就像...
Like...

385
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:05,610
像隨手塗鴉?
Like graffiti tagging?

386
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:10,183
更像是藝術創作 只是這是非法的
More like art. It was just illegal.

387
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:15,587
那現在那個叛逆的作品在哪?
Where's all this rebel-artist shit now?

388
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,123
很久之前的事了
That was a long time ago.

389
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,460
你還保留了一些 不是嗎?
You still have some, don't you? Yeah.

390
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,765
給我看看      不
Show me, please.        No.

391
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:26,620
如果你給我看 
If you show me, 

392
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,871
我就能寫出能讓你解放西藏的演講
I will write you a speech that you could free Tibet with.

393
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,798
為什麼你這麼想看?
Why do you want to see it so bad?

394
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:33,276
因為我想要驚喜
Because I like to be surprised.

395
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:40,420
我們得快點      好吧
We have to be quick.        All right.

396
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:44,054
這是誰的房間?
Whose room is this?

397
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:45,657
沒人住
No one's.

398
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,199
噢 天啊
Oh, wow.

399
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:08,070
我想畫張全景的 
I like to do it big. 

400
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,915
有高速公路 各種建築 廣告牌什麼的
Like freeways, buildings, billboards.

401
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:18,354
而且速度很快 好像我一小時能跑百萬英里
And fast. Like I'm running a million miles an hour.

402
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:21,721
不用費力去思考 你懂嗎?
No thinking, you know?

403
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:25,429
你為什麼放棄了?
Why did you stop?

404
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:32,664
因為我被逮到了 我媽媽受不了這個
'Cause I got caught and my mom couldn't take it.

405
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:36,512
不管怎樣 我把它們都扔了
Anyway, I threw them all away.

406
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:37,569
肯定有人喜歡他們
Someone must have liked them.

407
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:41,881
把它們從垃圾裡救回來 不是嗎?
Pulled them out of the trash, didn't they?

408
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:45,246
誰會那麼干呢?      你們在這幹嗎?
Who was it?        What are you doing in here?

409
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:50,325
我只是帶著珀特在屋裡轉轉
I was just showing Porter around the house.

410
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,424
我們在一個數學小組
He's on the math team with me.

411
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:56,627
好吧      時間不早了
Right.        Time to go.

412
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:02,601
對我媽的態度 我很抱歉
Hey, I'm sorry about my mom.

413
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:05,935
她只是 你知道...      沒事
She's just, you know...        That's fine.

414
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,310
你知道 你非常
You know, you are

415
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:16,379
非常奇怪
so much weirder...

416
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:23,001
不是奇怪 我的意思是 與眾不同
Not weird, I just mean, like, different, I guess.

417
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:26,861
你比我想像中更加獨特
You're a lot more different than I thought you'd be.

418
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,216
對於一個我出高價
You know, for someone I'm paying a lot of money 

419
00:31:29,216 --> 00:31:30,331
請他幫我寫演講稿的人來說
to write a speech for me,

420
00:31:30,331 --> 00:31:31,656
你有點詞不達意
you're not very articulate.

421
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:34,341
我的文筆比口才好
I'm much better on paper.

422
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:36,369
我們拭目以待
We'll see.

423
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:41,375
謝謝你沒笑我
Thank you for not laughing, I guess.

424
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:42,834
我不會那麼干
I wouldn't do that.

425
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:44,739
我不會嘲笑你
I wouldn't laugh.

426
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:46,707
很好
Good.

427
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:50,777
非常好
Very, very good.

428
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:10,899
*記憶中我們相見在北海邊*
*We salute at the threshold of the North Sea in my mind*

429
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:14,940
*點點頭對著帶我來這的一堆煩心事*
*And a nod to the boredom that drove me here*

430
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:19,072
*面對潮水 開始游泳*
*To face the tide and swim*

431
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:23,810
*我游啊游啊*
*I swim, oh, swim*

432
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:28,319
接著最後看起來奇怪的事 變得司空見慣
And, eventually, what seems strange becomes common.

433
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,587
看起來不可能的事 變得無比真實
What seemed impossible becomes real.

434
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:37,895
*水已經沒過膝蓋 我該再等等 還是跳入水中?*
*Up to my knees now, do I wait? Do I dive?*

435
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:40,485
*大海似乎很瞭解我*
*The sea has seen my like before*

436
00:32:40,485 --> 00:32:43,529
*雖然這是我第一次也是最後一次游泳*
*though it's my first and perhaps last time*

437
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:49,844
*請叫我施洗者 請稱這是一場洗禮*
*Let's call me a Baptist, call this the drowning of the past*

438
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:55,479
*她站在海邊 衝我背後扔石頭*
*She's there on the shoreline Throwing stones at my back*

439
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,953
*所以游泳吧 直到你見不到陸地*
*So swim until you can't see land*

440
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,820
*游吧 直到你見不到陸地*
*Swim until you can"t see land*

441
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:04,985
*游吧 直到你見不到陸地*
*Swim until you can"t see land*

442
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:08,792
*你是個人還是個沙包?*
*Are you a man or are you a bag of sand?*

443
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:15,337
直到一切變得像以前一樣
Until things almost start to feel the way they used to.

444
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:19,902
修好了 親愛的 跟新的似的
Fixed it, love. Working like a charm.

445
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:22,171
好像一切都重新開始了
It's like it's all brand new.

446
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:34,213
沃特 沃特 醒醒 醒醒      怎麼了?
Walter. Walter, wake up. Wake up.        Mmm. What?

447
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:36,062
是亨利 他溜出房間 
It's Henry. He snuck out of his room. 

448
00:33:36,062 --> 00:33:38,020
又跑到車庫去了
He's down in the garage again by himself.

449
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:40,323
好吧 告訴他回去睡覺
Well, tell him to come to bed.

450
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:42,038
我知道 我每晚都這麼和他說 
I know. I tell him every night, 

451
00:33:42,038 --> 00:33:45,233
但是他得親耳聽到你說
but he needs to hear it from, you know, you.

452
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,191
好吧
Yeah.

453
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,603
我就來
I'm on it.

454
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,608
喲 這麼晚了你要去哪?
Whoa, where are you going this time of night?

455
00:33:57,668 --> 00:33:59,875
我要去告訴那小傢伙讓他停手 我要睡覺
I'm gonna tell the little guy to knock it off so I can sleep.

456
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:00,938
好吧
Right.

457
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,418
我也要去那 來吧 我們去包抄他
I was going to the same place. Come on. Let's triple-team him.

458
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,550
算了吧 你和你的毛茸茸朋友去吧
That's okay. You've got your little furry friend.

459
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:12,683
晚安
Good night.

460
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,869
除了球拍 你還在做什麼?
What are you making besides a racket?

461
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:25,625
你也睡不著嗎?
You couldn't sleep, either?

462
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:29,073
哦 夥計 事實上 我正睡得香
Well, actually, mate, I was having a brilliant kip

463
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:31,340
接著就被你的崩崩聲給吵醒了
till you started banging away.

464
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,047
我有個主意
I just had this idea.

465
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:36,821
哦 什麼? 讓我們明天再想吧
Oh, yeah? Well, let's have the idea in the morning.

466
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:39,712
就十分鐘 求你了
Just 10 more minutes, please?

467
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:41,415
十分鐘 好吧
Ten more minutes, all right, yes.

468
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:44,893
不過以後沒我在身邊不要亂動這些工具
But no more mucking about with tools when I'm not around.

469
00:34:44,893 --> 00:34:45,929
這很危險
It's not safe.

470
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,758
媽媽和你說不要動 你要聽她的話 還有晚上也是
Or when your mother's asked you not to. Or at night.

471
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:52,918
在廁所 在爬埃弗勒斯峰的時候
Or in a toilet. Or when you're climbing Mount Everest.

472
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:54,761
還有捏鼻子的時候 同意嗎?
Or picking your nose. Agreed?

473
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,236
同意      那你說吧
Agreed.        There you go.

474
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:03,138
你能和我說話嗎? 我喜歡聽你說話
Can you talk to me? I like it when you talk.

475
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:05,638
你想讓我說什麼?
What do you want me to talk about?

476
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:07,182
隨便 隨便說說
Doesn't matter. Just talk.

477
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:10,650
你的聲音很好玩
You have a funny voice.

478
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:13,952
你很容易滿足 不是嗎?
You're quite easily entertained, aren't you?

479
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:22,088
給你一個小電鋸 一塊木頭 再來一點嘮叨
Give you a buzz saw, a block of wood, and some chatter...

480
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:33,024
嘿 沃特 你和他說了嗎?
Hey, Walter, did you talk to him?

481
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,911
是啊 一切正常 他會回去睡覺
Yes, and everything's fine. He'll stick to the schedule.

482
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:37,305
出什麼事了?
What's going on?

483
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:41,076
我有了新點子 親愛的 現在得立刻投入工作
I've had a breakthrough, love. Got to get to work right away.

484
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:42,173
現在?
Now?

485
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,810
一刻都不能停
Not a moment to spare!

486
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:48,818
你簡直是個女神
You're a goddess.

487
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:03,504
先生 你今天真早啊
Sir? You're in early.

488
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:05,871
說曹操 曹操到
Just the woman I wanted to see.

489
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:07,932
看看這個
Have a look at this.

490
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:11,843
現在 我們得馬上開工
Now, we need to get started on this right away.

491
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,815
是一個海貍?
It's a beaver?

492
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:15,907
這是未來
It's the future.

493
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:17,375
就這個?
This?

494
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:19,815
會說話的木質海貍
The Talking Beaver Woodworking Set.

495
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,988
只要幾個簡單的工具 一塊木頭
You get your basic tools, a block of wood

496
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:25,618
還有一隻會說話的海貍陪你一起工作
and a talking beaver to work right alongside of you.

497
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:27,391
親愛的 你該看看那些孩子
You should see the kids, love.

498
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:29,522
我是說 他們有手機 電腦
I mean, they've got their cell phones and their computers,

499
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:32,158
但是 你給他們一塊木頭 一個錘子 一把鋸子
but, wow, you give them a block of wood, a hammer and a saw?

500
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:33,566
我的親娘七舅老爺
Bob's their bleeding auntie.

501
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:36,161
他們那些可憐的小腦袋可喜歡這些啦
Their poor little brains are starving for something like this.

502
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:39,640
所以 你想說建一條新的生產線 在聖誕的時候?
So, you're talking about a new product line for what? Christmas?

503
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,931
聖誕? 我說的是現在 女士 今天
Christmas? I'm talking about right now, woman. Today.

504
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:44,880
就這個上午
This morning.

505
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:49,406
我覺得應該要有個工具配套市場
I guess there could be an ancillary market in more tools.

506
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:51,318
還要對木料進行粗加工?
Maybe pre-cut lumber pieces?

507
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,462
有點像樂高玩具 不過都是用木頭做的
Sort of like Lego kits but made of wood.

508
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:56,520
你可以隨心所欲地把它們拼成各種形狀
And you can work them into shapes on your own.

509
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,587
現在 你也要出謀劃策
Now, that's using your scone.

510
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,896
不只是用木頭做 對嗎? 我們走
Not just made out of wood, is it? Let's go.

511
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:02,495
但是這就意味著 我是說
But this would mean, I mean,

512
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,245
即使我們及時完成了 
even if we could get one ready in time, 

513
00:37:04,245 --> 00:37:06,400
這將會是我們展會的唯一展品
this is all we would have for the Expo.

514
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:08,364
這就是我們所需要的全部 親愛的
That's all we'll need, my darling.

515
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:20,709
對於那些對一個齧齒動物掌權
And for every person that points out

516
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:22,614
存在疑議的人來說
that there's a rodent at the helm,

517
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:24,481
另一個事實提醒著他們 
there's another to remind him or her 

518
00:37:24,481 --> 00:37:28,249
公司的產量已經提高了35%
that production has already increased by 35%.

519
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:32,425
一開始的兩周後 沒有人辭職
At the end of those first two weeks, not one person resigns.

520
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:33,918
一個都沒用
Not one.

521
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,597
現在 我們將要開始...
Now, we're going to start with...

522
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:43,367
海貍先生 作為核心產品 再加上後續的周邊產品
The Beaver, as a core item, along with endless project kits

523
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:45,723
可以扭轉局勢
could produce an exponential return.

524
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:50,176
問題是 我們是要繼續為生存掙扎
The question is, do we want to continue struggling merely to survive,

525
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:55,149
還是要接受全新 前所未有的嘗試
or do we want to embrace something new, something different,

526
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:57,310
看看它能給我們帶了什麼?
and see where it takes us?

527
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:03,851
我們親愛的傑瑞玩具公司又再次
Once again, our beloved Jerry Co.

528
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:08,124
充滿了美好前程 激情 和活力
Has vision, power, energy, balls.

529
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:14,393
今天早上三號產品 我們得到了一些製造商的關注
Item number three this morning, we've got some fabrication concerns.

530
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:16,003
你們在笑什麼
Why are you all laughing?

531
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:59,180
今天和梅西醫生談話了?
Did you talk to Dr. Macy today?

532
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:05,514
是啊 他說我恢復得很好
Indeed. He says we're coming along just brilliantly.

533
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,347
他有沒有給你一個時間表 
Well, did he give you some kind of a timeline 

534
00:39:10,347 --> 00:39:12,454
這個療程何時能結束
for when the treatment might be over?

535
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:15,027
沒 沒確定 親愛的
No, nothing specific, love.

536
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:17,225
一周 還是一個月或者...
Like a week, or a month, or...

537
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:19,529
這得有個過程 親愛的
it's a process, love.

538
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:22,328
到了合適的時間我們會知道的
We'll know when the time is right.

539
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:28,043
現在 休息吧 美味的小餡餅
Now, rest up, you delicious little tart.

540
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,545
明天還有很多事
There's more where that came from.

541
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:08,412
赫克托 我一向說什麼來著 上交之前讀一讀嘛
Hector, what do I always say, man? Read it before you turn it in.

542
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:10,076
看在老天的份上 這是你的家事
It was about your own family, for Christ's sake.

543
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:11,599
我以為既然是家事 
I just figured since it was personal, 

544
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,055
就不會有測試題
there wouldn't be no test questions on it.

545
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:16,284
但是你奶奶告發了你      是啊 她很是自豪
But your own grandma turned you in.        Yes. She was so proud.

546
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:17,903
開始講述你寫的那些
Talking about the stuff that you had wrote 

547
00:40:17,904 --> 00:40:20,319
她在產房的日子
about her back in the day in D.R.

548
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:23,024
突然她意識到我對此是不知情的
And then all of a sudden, she could just tell I knew nothing about it.

549
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,260
於是她開始痛哭 打電話給校長說她沒有
So, she starts crying. She calls the principal, says she doesn't...

550
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:27,359
這事和我沒什麼關係 你明白的 對吧
All right. My name stays out of this. You understand that, right?

551
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,055
她說我撒謊 是個騙子
She called me a liar and a cheater.

552
00:40:29,055 --> 00:40:31,169
好吧 好吧
All right, all right, all right. Look.

553
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:35,671
我給你搞一個虛假網站 可以了吧
Okay, I'm gonna make a dummy website, all right?

554
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:37,872
你告訴他們你是自己出的錢 然後論文就到手了
You tell them you sent in your money, you got your paper.

555
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,972
你就知道這些就夠了 行不
That's all you know, okay?

556
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,143
赫克托 我得走了
Hector, look, I gotta go.

557
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:44,686
明天我就給你網站哈
I'm gonna give you the website tomorrow, all right?

558
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,415
赫克托      好的 好的
Hector!        Yes, yes, yes.

559
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:48,821
非常好
Great. Good.

560
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,550
諾拉
Norah!

561
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:52,318
嗨      嗨
Hey.        Hey.

562
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,975
你怎麼汗涔涔的      我剛在做瑜伽
Why are you all sweaty?        I was doing yoga.

563
00:40:57,421 --> 00:41:00,095
真男人啊      下犬式太操蛋了
Manly.        Downward Dog's a bitch.

564
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:05,002
你今晚忙不忙      你這是約我出去嗎
Are you busy tonight?        Are you asking me out?

565
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:06,330
不 完全不是
No. Not at all.

566
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:09,640
我就隨便問一下 如果你忙的話
I was just gonna casually inquire if you're busy

567
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,420
就看不到我花費整晚
without making it seem like I'd been up all night 

568
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,910
精心策劃的結晶了
planning something elaborate.

569
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,746
你還花了整晚精心策劃啊
Have you been up all night planning something elaborate?

570
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:18,178
是啊 我準備了地圖裝備什麼的
Yeah, I have, like, maps and stuff.

571
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:23,971
你七點來接我吧 十二點前我得回家
You can pick me up at 7:00. I have to be back at 12:00.

572
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:28,527
太讚了 這就是約會了 是約會吧
Awesome, so it's a date. I mean, it is, right?

573
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:30,796
拭目以待吧
We'll see.

574
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:34,959
淡定
Cool.

575
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:39,135
別搞砸了啊
Don't mess this up.

576
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,861
你讓我來主導 是吧
You let me lead, all right?

577
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:12,230
你準備好了沒 座位預定在八點
Are you almost ready? Reservation's at 8:00.

578
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:15,539
該死 女人 看看你的樣子
Bloody hell, woman. Look at you.

579
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,345
你看上去挺帥氣嘛
Well, you're looking pretty good yourself.

580
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:20,643
你什麼樣沒見過啊      是嘛
Yeah, well, you ain't seen nothing yet.        Yeah?

581
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:23,241
女孩們為我趕製了很特別的物件
The girls whipped up something special for me.

582
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:28,553
說的就是小號全套禮服 親愛的
We're talking full-on tux, love.

583
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:33,227
給我們幾分鐘換個衣服 之後我們出發
Yeah. Just give us a minute to pop it on, and we'll be off.

584
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:35,321
等一下 這是我們的週年紀念日 親愛的
Wait, it's our anniversary, honey.

585
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,990
所以我才找來禮服啊
That's why I went for the penguin suit.

586
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,898
我不想跟一個玩偶慶祝結婚20週年紀念日
I do not want to celebrate 20 years of marriage with a puppet.

587
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:46,030
很抱歉 我一直耐著性子也支持你
I'm sorry. I've been very patient and I've been very supportive,

588
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:49,804
但我想要的是你 不是他
but I want you, not him.

589
00:42:52,102 --> 00:42:54,548
今晚不要
Not tonight.

590
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:05,216
嗨
Hi.

591
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:08,158
布萊克 兩位
Black, party of two.

592
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:23,811
我什麼時候能看一下你的成果
So, when do I get to see some of your pages?

593
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:26,371
不行 這是個傳銷騙局
Never. it's a pyramid scheme.

594
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:28,741
我沒告訴過你嗎      沒有
I didn't tell you that?        No.

595
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:31,150
你沒拿到小冊子麼
You didn't get the brochure?

596
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:34,018
開玩笑的 我已經搞定了      最好是這樣
I'm kidding. I'll get it done.        You better.

597
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:35,383
我給你500塊
I'm not giving you 500 bucks 

598
00:43:35,383 --> 00:43:38,323
不是讓你買個平板電視放宿舍裡
just so you can buy a flat screen for your dorm room.

599
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:41,124
我沒有買平板放宿舍裡
I'm not buying a flat screen for my dorm room.

600
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:42,220
那是什麼
Then, what?

601
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:44,960
木乃伊      不是木乃伊
A mummy.        No mummy.

602
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:49,103
那錢要留著買什麼      沒什麼
Then, what? What's it going to?        Nothing.

603
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,203
嗯哼
Mmm-mmm.

604
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:54,333
你不是那種心血來潮的人
A guy like you doesn't do anything for no reason.

605
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:56,071
你已經計劃好了
You've got a plan.

606
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,955
我聽了廣播的天氣預報 
I was listening to the radio and, 

607
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,056
顯然週末會非常熱
apparently, it's gonna be really hot this weekend.

608
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:13,291
不是熱死人那種 但在均值以上
Not hot-hot, just above average.

609
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:20,664
你的工作進行得如何      挺順利 很忙
So, how's work?        Good. Yeah, busy.

610
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:23,161
很忙
Busy?

611
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:30,052
地圖? 你攢錢就是為了這個?
Maps? That's what you're saving all your money for?

612
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:31,437
是的
Yeah.

613
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,425
好吧 解釋解釋 
Okay, explain, 

614
00:44:32,425 --> 00:44:34,677
現在看起來每個紅點都像是藏屍處
because right now, it's looking like where you hide your bodies.

615
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:39,161
是的 每個紅點都代表一具死屍
It is. Every red dot is a dead body.

616
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,211
我說的是實話
Just trying to be honest.

617
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:42,450
說正經的 這是幹嘛用的
Okay, really, what's it for?

618
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:46,879
這上面所有地方
It's, like, all these places 

619
00:44:46,879 --> 00:44:49,432
都是物是人非之地
where everything changed in the blink of an eye.

620
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,598
就像馬丁路德金遇刺的陽台
Like the balcony where Martin Luther King got shot.

621
00:44:52,656 --> 00:44:55,728
伍迪·格斯搭乘第一班火車的鐵軌
The train tracks where Woody Guthrie hopped on his first train.

622
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,261
還有呢
And?

623
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:03,038
我就去參觀這些地方
And I just visit them and

624
00:45:03,038 --> 00:45:05,578
一直到布朗大學開學為止
then I end up at Brown the day before school starts.

625
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:08,555
算是探尋自我之旅嗎
It's kind of like a find-yourself trip?

626
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:13,304
不 更像某種告別之旅
No. More like a lose-stuff trip.

627
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:17,420
你想要告別什麼
What kind of stuff do you want to lose?

628
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:21,132
最新一次統計是有49樣東西
At last count, 49 things.

629
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:28,899
一項精心策劃的神秘計劃 有些許古怪
An elaborate, mysterious plan, and a little weird.

630
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:32,362
但是我喜歡
But I like it.

631
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:35,872
你的論文報酬發揮作用了
It's your paper-writing dollars at work.

632
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:45,576
這又是哪出
What was that for?

633
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:47,955
你說你喜歡出人意料嘛
You said you liked to be surprised.

634
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:52,652
準備好了麼      幹嘛
Ready?        For what?

635
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:08,370
這地方不錯
It's a great place.

636
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:11,970
有點可怕 但是蠻漂亮的
It's kind of scary but beautiful.

637
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:18,352
我不確定你喜歡什麼顏色 所以我備了各種顏色
Look, I wasn't sure which color you liked, so I kind of got everything.

638
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:20,513
希望你會喜歡陽光黃
I hope you like sunburst yellow.

639
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:24,144
珀特 珀特 你要幹啥
Porter? Porter, come on. What are you doing?

640
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,954
很贊是吧
Is this fantastic, or what?

641
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:28,758
你開什麼玩笑 贊是贊 但我不準備碰它
Are you kidding? it's awesome, but I'm not going to touch it.

642
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:31,233
為什麼呢      因為所以
Why not?        Because.

643
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:36,493
啥因為所以 幹嘛不畫      因為我不想畫
Because, what? Why not?        Because I don't want to.

644
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:40,891
來吧 諾拉 你有畫畫的天賦
Come on, Norah. You have this amazing thing that you do.

645
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:43,525
你在這裡可以盡情釋放自己 
You just put all of yourself out there. 

646
00:46:43,525 --> 00:46:45,874
我做圍觀群眾就好
All I can do is sound like other people.

647
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,413
我知道你有話想說      好吧
I know you have something to say.        Okay.

648
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:52,152
你盡自己最大努力做吧      別介
Knock yourself out. You do it.        Come on.

649
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:55,050
不 我不會畫
No. I don't paint.

650
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:58,693
怎麼不會呢 你裝別人可是很在行
Why not? You're so good at being other people.

651
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:02,788
好吧 也許我能畫畫 但      珀特 畫吧
Well, maybe if I could paint I would, but...        Porter, just start.

652
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:05,358
好的
Okay.

653
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:11,773
你要塗什麼 寫諾拉和珀特永結同心?
What are you going to do? Write "Norah + Porter forever"?

654
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,701
那樣會很可愛
Because that'd be pretty cute.

655
00:47:46,063 --> 00:47:47,269
對吧
Right?

656
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:54,615
這是你一直想要說的話      不
That's what you've been wanting to say.        No.

657
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:57,811
你寫了400頁的筆記 一個字都沒提到他
You wrote 400 pages of notes. Not one word about him?

658
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,287
我哥哥的事和你沒關係
What happened to my brother is none of your business.

659
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:01,412
你明白麼
Do you understand?

660
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:03,321
我以為你有話要說
I just thought there was something you wanted to say

661
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,360
但不知如何開口
and you didn't know how.

662
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:07,624
這不關你的事
It's none of your business.

663
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:10,690
什麼樣的人能做出這樣的事來
What kind of person does something like this?

664
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:12,995
你有毛病麼
What's the matter with you?

665
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:30,183
繼續拆開吧
Go on. Open it.

666
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:34,555
亨利幫我做的 基本上就是
Henry helped me, which basically means

667
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:37,854
我買料 他負責手工
that I bought the wood and he did all the work.

668
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,461
這是個滿載回憶的盒子
It's a memory box.

669
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:48,364
很精美 謝謝
It's very nice. Thank you.

670
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:50,403
打開看看
Look inside.

671
00:48:55,899 --> 00:48:59,437
我認為記起我們過去的生活是非常重要的
I thought it was important to remind ourselves of how things were.

672
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:02,407
生活該是這副模樣
How things should be.

673
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:17,094
沃特 不不不 沒事了 沒事
Walter. No, no, no. it's okay. it's okay.

674
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,528
這就是你想要的嗎
Is this what you want?

675
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,704
這是療程嗎 老天爺 女人啊
Is this progress? Christ, woman!

676
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:29,605
他得的是抑鬱癥 不是健忘癥
He's suffering from depression, not amnesia!

677
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:32,161
你認為問題是出在他忘了過去的生活麼
You think the problem is he can't remember these things?

678
00:49:32,235 --> 00:49:34,846
不 他不能回去 你還不明白麼
No. He can't go back. Don't you see that?

679
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,481
所有的過去都挖掘出來 
This is all in the past, and dredging it up... 

680
00:49:38,481 --> 00:49:40,252
你知道這條路通向何方麼?
Do you know where this leads?

681
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:43,255
你知道沃特最終會走哪條路麼?
You know where this Walter goes?

682
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:47,887
站在十樓的陽台上 脖子一端還綁在浴簾桿上
To a 10th floor balcony, tied to a shower curtain rod.

683
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:49,862
這是你想要的嗎
Is that what you want?

684
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:53,927
你想要餘生都和今晚一樣嗎
You want the rest of your life to be just like tonight?

685
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:57,598
那就是沃特      不 沃特 來
Well, that was Walter.        No, Walter. No, come on.

686
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:01,936
看看這些 你好好看看
Look at this. You really look at this.

687
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,404
那是你 沃特
That's you, Walter.

688
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:08,105
記得嗎
Remember that?

689
00:50:09,072 --> 00:50:14,196
那時珀特剛出生 還那麼小
When Porter was born, and he was so little?

690
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:18,285
醫生把他從我身上拉出來 你就站在他身旁
And they pulled him out of me, and you stood right by him.

691
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:19,418
你直視他的雙眼
You looked him right in the eye,

692
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:21,190
你讓他知道你哪裡都不會去
and you let him know that you weren't going anywhere,

693
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:24,130
你就在他身邊 所以他不會感到害怕
that you were staying right there so he wouldn't be scared.

694
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:28,670
沃特 這才是你 這才是我愛著的 我需要的人
Walter, that's you. That's the man I love. That's the man I need.

695
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,456
這樣的你還在你的體內 親愛的
You're still inside there, honey.

696
00:50:33,997 --> 00:50:38,241
我知道你在的 我們能回到過去
I know you're in there. We can go back.

697
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:40,110
我們能過回以前的生活
We can get back to the way that we used to be.

698
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:42,912
我們不會再一次踏上同樣的路途了 梅勒迪斯
We are not going down that street again, Meredith.

699
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:48,479
這個人已經走到頭了 他消失了 他必須消失
This man is a dead end. He's gone. He has to be.

700
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:50,181
你明白麼
You get it?

701
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:52,315
我為你爭取過
I fought for you.

702
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:55,244
你沒法下床那兩年
I practically breathed for you for two years 

703
00:50:55,244 --> 00:50:56,416
我一直在你身邊
when you couldn't even get out of bed,

704
00:50:56,416 --> 00:50:59,292
我會繼續為你爭取 因為我愛你
and I will continue to fight for you because I love you.

705
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:03,329
我得知道你會回來 求你回來吧
I've got to know that you're coming back. Come back to me, please.

706
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:05,333
沃特
Walter?

707
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:08,304
沃特
Walter?

708
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:24,622
諾拉 再來一次我可真承受不起
Norah, I can't take this again.

709
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,491
走吧
Come on.

710
00:51:37,627 --> 00:51:40,130
你好 我們一接到消息就趕過來了
Hello. We came as soon as we heard.

711
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:45,250
我是海貍先生 這位是珀特的父親 沃特
I'm the Beaver, and this is Porter's dad, Walter.

712
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:48,351
我們會處理的 
Listen, we'll get it all sorted. 

713
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:49,747
我已經來了就會處理好一切
I'm here now so we'll take care of things.

714
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,247
開車注意安全
Have a nice safe drive home.

715
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:09,726
等一下
Wait.

716
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:16,140
珀特 慢點 我們談談
Porter, mate, hang about. Come on. We can discuss this. Come on.

717
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:17,678
把那個玩偶給我      冷靜
Give me that thing!        Calm down!

718
00:52:17,734 --> 00:52:20,044
給我 天殺的      住手
Give it to me! Goddamn it!        Stop it!

719
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:21,673
給我      住手
Give me that thing!        Stop!

720
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:23,342
別管他
Leave him alone!

721
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:29,788
珀特 珀特 天啊你沒事吧 沒傷著吧
Porter! Porter! Oh, my God. Porter, are you okay? Are you all right?

722
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,782
珀特 我看看你的手 流血了嗎
Porter, let me see your hands. Are they bleeding?

723
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:34,454
抱歉 兒子 我不是有意的
I'm sorry, son. I didn't mean to do that.

724
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:36,623
你別碰他
You keep your hands off him!

725
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:38,595
珀特 來 讓媽媽看看
Porter, come on. Let me see.

726
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:54,077
你現在開心了
Are you happy now?

727
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:55,916
珀特 珀特
Porter? Porter?

728
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:37,218
現在是五月的聖誕節
It's Christmas in May.

729
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,226
一些零售商如是說
That's what some retailers are saying

730
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:43,287
海貍先生的伐木工具箱正陸續售罄
with Mr. Beaver Woodchopper Kits selling out in droves.

731
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:46,459
近來 傑瑞公司一直飽受訂單劇減的困擾
Recently, Jerry Co. had been in steep decline,

732
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:49,868
今年頭幾個月一直徘徊在破產邊緣
hovering on the verge of bankruptcy earlier this year.

733
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,999
但是有了海貍先生 一時半時是不會破產了
But thanks to Mr. Beaver, that won't be happening any time soon.

734
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:59,111
這像是免費做了一百萬的廣告啊
It's like a $100 million ad campaign, for free!

735
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:07,159
傑瑞公司又重回業界 你爸爸會很自豪的
Jerry Co. 's back in the game. The old man would be so proud.

736
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:10,286
我得把公司交由你接管
I've got to hand it to you.

737
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:13,556
你在幕後操縱 然後就看我們的成績
You pulled all the strings, and look where we landed.

738
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:15,494
會再一次登頂
On top, for once.

739
00:54:19,956 --> 00:54:22,232
這很有成就感 不是麼      他們
It feels good, doesn't it?        They.

740
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:27,330
先生
Sir?

741
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:30,241
我的家人
My family.

742
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:33,738
現在我們手頭的採訪請求中誰來頭最大
Who's the biggest interview request we've had so far?

743
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,840
所有的早間新聞
All the morning shows. 

744
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,919
CNN CNBC...      今日新聞 去安排吧
CNN, CNBC...        Today Show, then. Set it up.

745
00:54:40,977 --> 00:54:44,754
但是今日新聞已經在播了
But, sir, the Today Show is on television.

746
00:54:44,814 --> 00:54:47,819
我們在遮掩什麼 我們是贏家哎 
What are we hiding? We're winners. 

747
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:51,411
應該站在屋頂向全世界呼喊
We should be shouting it from the rooftops.

748
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:53,793
這肯定會成為一段佳話
It would certainly be a story.

749
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:07,997
我跟你說個事 其他人我從不告訴
I'm gonna tell you something that I've never told anyone else,

750
00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:11,577
但我想你是準備好了的
but I think you're ready to hear it.

751
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:14,714
好的
Okay.

752
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,020
我不是玩偶
I'm not a puppet.

753
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:23,726
我是真實的
I'm real.

754
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:27,265
活生生的
I'm alive.

755
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:30,498
世人需要知道這一點
And the world needs to know.

756
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:54,090
你沒事吧親愛的
You all right, love?

757
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:58,899
有麻煩嗎
Some trouble?

758
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:01,795
我今天和梅西醫生談過
I talked to Dr. Macy today.

759
00:56:03,927 --> 00:56:06,464
他又為自己辯解什麼
What did he have to say for himself?

760
00:56:12,235 --> 00:56:14,977
他說你已經有一年多沒去看過他
He says that you haven't been to see him in over a year.

761
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:19,124
梅西醫生說你病了 沃特 你病得很重
Dr. Macy says that you're sick, Walter. Very sick.

762
00:56:19,124 --> 00:56:20,078
是啊 沒錯
Yeah. Right.

763
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:22,054
他說這有點狂躁癥的意思
He said this sounds like some kind of a mania.

764
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:25,218
誰他媽關心梅西醫生說了什麼
Okay, well, who gives a shit what Dr. Macy has to say?

765
00:56:25,281 --> 00:56:26,282
我治好了他
I fixed him.

766
00:56:27,283 --> 00:56:28,743
其他人似乎都接受了 
Everybody else seems to get it. 

767
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:32,063
亨利 同事 除了你之外
Henry, people at work. Everyone except you.

768
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:34,359
這還不能說明什麼嗎
Does that tell you something?

769
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:36,681
你想永遠這麼活下去嗎 通過手來交談
You just want to live like this forever? Talking through your hand?

770
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:39,606
我敢說至今為止是前所未有的大成功 不是嗎
I'd say it's been a pretty smashing success so far, wouldn't you?

771
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:43,075
你需要幫助 沃特 你需要幫助 你病了
You need help, Walter! You need help! You're sick.

772
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:47,661
幫助 吃藥 讀書 看專家
"Help. " Eat the pill, read the book, see the bleeding expert.

773
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:49,454
沃特最終還是要自救
Walter finally helped himself

774
00:56:49,454 --> 00:56:50,613
聽聽你說的話 你瘋了
Listen to yourself. This is insane.

775
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:51,708
你在和一個玩偶講話
You're talking about a puppet.

776
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:55,552
不 梅勒迪斯 是你在和玩偶講話
No, Meredith. You're talking about a bloody puppet.

777
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:58,587
我們談論的是一個奇跡
We're talking about a miracle.

778
00:57:01,518 --> 00:57:03,225
我們是誰 沃特
Who's "we," Walter?

779
00:57:11,995 --> 00:57:14,407
我知道這很艱難 同伴 我知道
I know it's hard, mate. I know.

780
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,473
你不能搞混了
You can't afford to get mixed up in all of this.

781
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:23,576
你要繼續前進 勇往直前不要回頭
You just keep moving. Keep moving and don't look back.

782
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:42,003
你說的沒錯
You're right, of course.

783
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,993
沃特病了
Walter is sick.

784
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:54,074
但是有一點不要搞錯 親愛的 我哪裡都不會去
But make no mistake about it, love. I'm not going anywhere.

785
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:04,721
我已經租好了房子
I've rented a house.

786
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:08,327
兒子 還有能帶的我都要帶過去
I'm taking the boys and everything we can carry.

787
00:58:08,384 --> 00:58:11,695
我不想你打電話來 也不想看到你過去串門
I don't want you to call. I don't want you to visit.

788
00:58:13,923 --> 00:58:17,803
如果你決定要丟棄自己 我是沒法阻止你
If you're determined to lose your mind, well, I can't stop you.

789
00:58:18,628 --> 00:58:23,165
但是我不會放任兒子們眼睜睜看你發瘋
But I'm not gonna let them stand there and watch it. Not my sons.

790
00:58:29,138 --> 00:58:30,844
在單位你瘋一瘋可以 
Insanity may play at the office, 

791
00:58:31,715 --> 00:58:33,815
但是在法官面前可不起作用
but it's not gonna work in front of a judge.

792
00:59:32,135 --> 00:59:34,172
為什麼你不跟我們一起走啊
Why aren't you coming with us?

793
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,984
下次吧 夥伴 下一次吧
Another time, mate. Another time.

794
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:43,420
可我想跟你在一起
But I want to stay with you.

795
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:48,524
你先跟媽媽走好麼 這問題我們會處理好 看著吧
You go with your mum, all right? We'll get it sorted. You'll see.

796
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:51,327
很快一切就又會好起來的
Everything will be good again real soon. All right.

797
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:53,089
拜拜      走吧
Bye.        Let's go.

798
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:54,190
拜拜
Bye.

799
01:00:05,635 --> 01:00:07,308
我愛你 爸爸
I love you, Daddy.

800
01:00:09,973 --> 01:00:12,613
我也愛你 兒子 我也愛你
I love you, too, son. I love you, too.

801
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:17,620
去吧 你該走了 去吧
Go on. Off you go. Go on.

802
01:00:52,782 --> 01:00:55,353
有時 麥特啊 我能叫你麥特嗎
Well, sometimes, Matt... May I call you Matt?

803
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:56,453
當然可以
Yeah, sure.

804
01:00:56,519 --> 01:01:01,696
有時 在半夜的時候
Sometimes, a single inspiration just comes to you

805
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:03,897
你靈光一現
in the middle of the night.

806
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:09,308
但是你的天賦似乎隱藏在手套玩偶背後
But your genius seems to hide in a stuffed toy.

807
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:13,142
所以人們不得不懷疑你精神有點毛病
So people have to doubt your sanity a little.

808
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:18,345
哎 莫扎特有時候還學貓叫呢
Well, Mozart was said to occasionally meow like a cat,

809
01:01:18,474 --> 01:01:20,476
但是他的音樂事業一帆風順
but he got on all right.

810
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:22,089
他的音樂還是很偉大 你不這樣認為麼
Great music, don't you think?

811
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,690
沃特 我想談一下抑鬱癥
Walter, I want to talk about depression.

812
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:28,092
因為據我得到的消息
Because the way it's been told to me,

813
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:29,984
你開始用玩偶交談
this whole thing started as a way for you 

814
01:01:29,984 --> 01:01:31,257
完全是為了治療心理疾病
to deal with your mental illness.

815
01:01:31,554 --> 01:01:33,932
好吧
Well, all right.

816
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:35,229
麥特 有時候
Well, sometimes, Matt,

817
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:41,168
我們到達一定高度之後 為了繼續前進
we reach a point where, in order to go on,

818
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:43,835
就不得不將過去的記錄抹去
we have to wipe the slate clean.

819
01:01:44,734 --> 01:01:47,874
我們要將自身視為一個盒子並置身其中
We start to see ourselves as a box that we're trapped inside.

820
01:01:48,304 --> 01:01:50,580
無論我們怎樣嘗試逃脫出來
And no matter how we try and escape,

821
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,143
自救 看心理醫生 嗑藥
self-help, therapy, drugs,

822
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:55,883
我們只會越陷越深
we just sink further and further down.

823
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:59,017
只有一種方式才能真正地突破牢籠
The only way to truly break out of the box

824
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:01,153
就是捨棄所有
is just to get rid of it altogether.

825
01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:04,498
我是說 你起初所鑄造的輝煌
I mean, you built it in the first place.

826
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:08,229
如果你身邊的人都從精神上打擊你 輝煌又有何用
If the people around you are breaking your spirit, who needs them?

827
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:10,771
老婆假裝愛你
Your wife who pretends to love you,

828
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:12,669
兒子忍受不了你
your son who can't even stand you.

829
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:15,232
我說 把他們的苦逼置於腦後吧
I mean, put them out of their misery.

830
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:17,272
重新開始不可怕
Starting over isn't crazy.

831
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:22,081
可怕的是日復一日
Crazy is being miserable

832
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:25,243
變得苦逼 夢遊樣四處轉
and walking around half asleep, numb,

833
01:02:25,243 --> 01:02:27,714
麻木不仁
day after day after day.

834
01:02:27,777 --> 01:02:29,848
可怕的是假裝開心
Crazy is pretending to be happy.

835
01:02:31,214 --> 01:02:34,559
自己悲慘的餘生
Pretending that the way things are

836
01:02:34,617 --> 01:02:38,030
都不得不一直維持假裝的狀態生活
is the way they have to be for the rest of your bleeding life.

837
01:02:38,821 --> 01:02:41,461
所有潛在的希望
All the potential, hope,

838
01:02:41,557 --> 01:02:43,594
所有的愉悅 感受
all that joy, feeling,

839
01:02:43,659 --> 01:02:47,038
所有生活從你身上榨取的激情
all that passion that life has sucked out of you.

840
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:49,603
伸出手 抓住它
Reach out, grab a hold of it

841
01:02:49,665 --> 01:02:53,613
然後從吸血的暴民手中奪回來
and snatch it back from that blood-sucking rabble.

842
01:02:56,405 --> 01:02:58,385
沃特 很高興你來接受採訪
Walter, it's good to have you here.

843
01:02:59,408 --> 01:03:00,751
謝謝
Thank you.

844
01:03:11,154 --> 01:03:14,363
這就是沃特.布萊克現在的寫照
This is a picture of Walter Black,

845
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:18,268
一個絕望 沮喪的人
a hopelessly depressed individual

846
01:03:20,229 --> 01:03:23,369
他變身海貍先生
who becomes the Beaver,

847
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:26,276
引發了一種風潮
who becomes a phenomenon.

848
01:03:26,369 --> 01:03:30,044
有很多人都非常渴望收聽
There's a lot of people out there who are desperate enough to listen.

849
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:32,942
人們似乎都擁有
People seem to love a train wreck

850
01:03:33,442 --> 01:03:34,978
一種葉公好龍的心理
when it's not happening to them.

851
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:42,919
諾拉 我們談談嘛
Norah, look, we need to talk.

852
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:44,055
現在不是好時機
Now's not a good time.

853
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,657
是啊 我給你打過電話 發過短信 還Q過你
Yeah, well, I called you, I texted you, and I IM'd you,

854
01:03:46,722 --> 01:03:48,565
從沒有時機對過的時候 所以
and it never seems like a good time. So...

855
01:03:48,624 --> 01:03:50,331
也許你該把這當成是一種暗示
Maybe you should take that as a hint.

856
01:03:50,426 --> 01:03:54,033
我是傻子 可以了吧 我也不想事情發展成這樣
I'm an idiot, all right? That's not how I wanted things to turn out.

857
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:56,633
我喜歡你 好吧 我確實很在乎
I like you, all right? I actually give a shit.

858
01:03:56,699 --> 01:04:00,017
你不用在乎我 你甚至不瞭解我
You don't give a shit about me. You don't even know me.

859
01:04:00,017 --> 01:04:01,913
你哥哥死於吸毒過量 對吧
Look, your brother OD'd, all right?

860
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:04,178
但是放棄自己的天賦 你成為現在這樣
But ditching your own talent, what makes you you,

861
01:04:04,273 --> 01:04:07,117
這也不會讓他起死回生 只會讓你一事無成
that's not gonna bring him back. It's just going to make you nothing.

862
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:11,057
你他媽離我遠點
You stay the hell away from me.

863
01:04:11,147 --> 01:04:13,090
你和你一家的精神病
You and your psycho family.

864
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:32,106
你開心嗎 你發自肺腑地開心嗎
Are you happy? Are you truly, truly happy?

865
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:34,851
約翰 我們身上都缺少一樣東西
Because, Jon, there's something lacking in all of us.

866
01:04:34,851 --> 01:04:36,010
缺失了一塊
A missing piece.

867
01:04:36,072 --> 01:04:39,645
有一小塊黑點或是暗點
There's a little bit of a black spot or a dark spot.

868
01:04:39,809 --> 01:04:41,482
明顯嗎
It's that obvious?

869
01:04:42,812 --> 01:04:45,452
約翰 很抱歉這樣說 但沃特需要一些幫助
I'm sorry to say, Jon, but Walter needs a little help.

870
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:48,255
因為他現在無法流利地表達出來
Because he's not too articulate at the moment.

871
01:04:48,317 --> 01:04:50,763
事實上 他的狀態很不好
In fact, he's not well.

872
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:04,439
起床 起床
Get up. Get up.

873
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:09,682
起來 你這個悲催的傢伙
Get up, you miserable wanker.

874
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:13,084
你不會從沃特口中挖到太多話的
You're not going to get much out of ol' Walter.

875
01:05:13,142 --> 01:05:15,816
他有些感覺不適 瞭解沒
He's feeling a bit under the weather, you see?

876
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:18,017
來吧 廣播節目而已
Come on. it's a radio show.

877
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:20,559
人們又看不到玩偶
People can't even see the puppet.

878
01:05:20,616 --> 01:05:23,495
為什麼要通過玩偶講話呢
So why talk through the puppet?

879
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:39,000
(相似點)

880
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:40,700
(咬嘴唇)

881
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,200
(按摩眉毛)

882
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:47,200
(憎恨父親 代代如此)

883
01:07:36,685 --> 01:07:37,993
你好
Hello?

884
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,055
小梅 是我
Mere, it's me.

885
01:07:39,355 --> 01:07:41,164
沃特 你沒事吧
Walter, are you okay?

886
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:42,634
嗯 我說
Yeah, look,

887
01:07:43,325 --> 01:07:46,829
我不能 我不能
I can't I can't

888
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:48,034
你在幹什麼
What are you doing?

889
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:51,636
發生了什麼事
What's going on?

890
01:07:51,967 --> 01:07:53,844
沃特 沃特 講話啊
Walter? Walter, talk to me!

891
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:57,911
你在和誰講電話
Who are you talking to?

892
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:01,619
掛掉 現在就掛掉      沃特
Hang up. You hang up right now.        Walter?

893
01:08:07,983 --> 01:08:11,897
你媽會縫合吧
Can your mother stitch?

894
01:08:26,502 --> 01:08:29,415
你永遠都贏不了
You'll never win.

895
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:43,662
我想要爸爸 爸爸在哪      我知道
I want Daddy. Where's Daddy?        I know.

896
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:46,199
我想要海貍先生
I want the Beaver.

897
01:08:47,656 --> 01:08:50,637
還沒睡呢 親愛的 你去找你爸行麼
Are you awake? Honey, you've got to go get Dad, all right?

898
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:52,101
為啥
Why?

899
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:55,233
他不接電話 亨利也哭個不停
He's not answering his phone, and Henry won't stop crying.

900
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:58,540
我都不知道怎麼辦是好 求你了
I just don't know what to do. Please.

901
01:08:58,601 --> 01:09:02,447
來 寶貝 我們一會就去找爸爸 不哭了啊
Come on, baby. We're going to find Daddy soon. it's okay.

902
01:09:50,486 --> 01:09:55,595
我沒有給你你想要的東西嗎
Haven't I given you exactly what you asked for?

903
01:10:02,565 --> 01:10:04,738
你不需要家人 沃特
You don't need them, Walter.

904
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:13,084
我愛你
I love you.

905
01:10:16,812 --> 01:10:20,316
我才是那個深深 深深愛著你的人
I'm the only one that really, really loves you.

906
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:27,697
所以我才不會讓你回到以前的生活
And that is why I would never let you go back.

907
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:33,770
永遠不會
Never.

908
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:49,086
我不想睡覺了
I don't want to sleep anymore.

909
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:52,381
也許
Maybe...

910
01:10:54,183 --> 01:10:56,493
也許我們該做點什麼
Maybe, you know, we should work on something.

911
01:10:59,855 --> 01:11:03,894
好的 同伴 來吧
Yeah, sure, mate. Come on.

912
01:11:17,306 --> 01:11:19,308
沃特 不要這樣
Walter, not like this.

913
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:20,786
不要這樣
Don't do it.

914
01:11:20,876 --> 01:11:22,910
情況會比以往糟糕 要糟糕得多
It will be worse than before. Much worse.

915
01:11:22,911 --> 01:11:26,586
你最後想變成一坨孤零零 毫無價值的屎嗎
Do you want to end up a worthless, lonely piece of shit?

916
01:11:28,517 --> 01:11:30,588
沒有我你就是個廢物 沃特
You're nothing without me, Walter.

917
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:32,488
廢物
Nothing!

918
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:35,056
我只是你的一部分
I'm the only part of you that works.

919
01:11:43,332 --> 01:11:45,005
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

920
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:03,832
沃特 你還記得你的兒子亨利嗎
Walter! How about Henry, your kid? You remember him?

921
01:12:04,386 --> 01:12:05,797
沃特
Walter!

922
01:12:08,891 --> 01:12:10,029
爸爸
Dad?

923
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:15,118
血壓正在下降 等上了手術台再動止血帶
BP's dropping. Don't touch the tourniquet until he's on the table.

924
01:12:15,531 --> 01:12:17,568
這是他還有脈搏的原因
It's the only reason he still has a pulse.

925
01:12:23,972 --> 01:12:25,645
醒來
Wake

926
01:12:26,942 --> 01:12:29,115
*從睡夢中醒來*
*From your sleep*

927
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:38,459
*擦乾眼淚*
*The drying of your tears*

928
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:44,599
*我們逃離了當下*
*Today we escape*

929
01:12:45,627 --> 01:12:47,800
作為傑瑞公司的新CEO
As the new CEO of Jerry Co. ,

930
01:12:48,897 --> 01:12:52,777
我向大家保證公司已經交由可靠之人管理
I want to assure people that the company is back in good hands.

931
01:12:55,738 --> 01:12:57,479
*收好行囊*
*Pack*

932
01:12:58,607 --> 01:13:01,349
*整好衣裳*
*And get dressed*

933
01:13:03,145 --> 01:13:09,926
*在你父親聽到我們之前*
*Before your father hears us*

934
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:13,366
*在*
*Before*

935
01:13:14,256 --> 01:13:16,668
*地獄之門*
*All hell*

936
01:13:18,627 --> 01:13:22,336
*開啟之前*
*Breaks loose*

937
01:13:47,523 --> 01:13:49,662
我給了珀特200塊
I paid Porter $200,

938
01:13:51,827 --> 01:13:54,000
他去做了調查
and he did some research.

939
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:56,372
我辜負了家人的期望
I let my family down.

940
01:13:57,633 --> 01:13:58,976
我對此感到非常慚愧
I'm really ashamed about this,

941
01:13:58,977 --> 01:14:02,255
我想讓這件事盡快過去
and I just want to put it behind me as soon as possible.

942
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:05,700
尊敬的珀特 布朗大學招生辦很遺憾地通知你

943
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:08,900
由於近來的一些事宜 你的大學錄取被取消
請來年再申

944
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:14,022
孩子 你在蓮花池裡釣魚嗎
Grasshopper, are you fishing in our lily pond?

945
01:14:14,049 --> 01:14:16,086
走吧 咱去探望下你爸爸
Come on. Let's go see your dad.

946
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:20,664
我不去      好吧
I'm not going.        Fine.

947
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:22,572
如果你不想去就不去 
If you don't want to go, then don't go. 

948
01:14:22,573 --> 01:14:24,238
但你也不能成天睡覺啊
But you're not just going to sleep all day.

949
01:14:26,028 --> 01:14:27,029
來吧
Come on.

950
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:29,840
來 珀特 起來 咱們走
Come on, Porter. Let's go. Get up!

951
01:14:29,898 --> 01:14:30,899
看在上帝的份上      住手
For Christ's sake.        Stop!

952
01:14:30,966 --> 01:14:32,946
我們走嗎      別動我
Are we going?        Stop! Stop!

953
01:14:33,535 --> 01:14:34,536
好的
Yes.

954
01:14:35,671 --> 01:14:36,775
隨你了
Fine.

955
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:42,115
找點事做 行嗎
Just do something, all right?

956
01:14:42,177 --> 01:14:45,386
出去散個步 偷輛車 我都不管
Go outside, take a walk, steal a car. I don't care.

957
01:14:45,447 --> 01:14:48,485
我回家時不想看到你還躺在床上
I just don't want to find you back in bed when I get home.

958
01:15:00,095 --> 01:15:01,870
你的家人來了
Your family's here.

959
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:17,412
沒事的 去吧
It's okay. Go on.

960
01:15:23,085 --> 01:15:25,224
嗨 小傢伙 你好嗎
Hey, little fella. How are you?

961
01:15:25,988 --> 01:15:27,092
好
Good.

962
01:15:27,723 --> 01:15:28,861
這是什麼呀
What's that?

963
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:32,475
這是個腦子      哇 是腦子呢
it's a brain.        Wow. it's a brain!

964
01:15:32,928 --> 01:15:34,965
媽媽說你的大腦壞掉了
Mom says yours got broken.

965
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:37,401
這個正能派上用場
This will come in handy.

966
01:15:37,499 --> 01:15:41,413
這麼說 你瘋了嗎
So, are you crazy?

967
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:44,873
也許吧
Maybe.

968
01:15:44,973 --> 01:15:46,213
我們正在這治療
We're working on it.

969
01:15:47,175 --> 01:15:50,054
這意味著你能回家嗎
Does that mean you can come home?

970
01:15:50,112 --> 01:15:51,629
這一點我們也正在努力
We're working on that, too.

971
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:53,488
你哥哥呢
Hey, where's your brother?

972
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:58,088
可能在睡覺 他一直在睡覺
Probably sleeping. It's all he does.

973
01:16:00,923 --> 01:16:02,300
過來
Come here.

974
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:05,967
過來 我要咬你的耳朵
Come here! I'll bite you on your ear!

975
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:17,200
(睡覺)

976
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:45,900
(這兒見 拜託!)

977
01:16:57,679 --> 01:16:58,953
喔
Wow.

978
01:17:00,349 --> 01:17:02,590
我給你發了15條短信
I must have sent you 15 texts.

979
01:17:03,385 --> 01:17:05,228
我都放棄了
I'd given up on you.

980
01:17:06,722 --> 01:17:10,795
彼此彼此吧
Well, that makes two of us.

981
01:17:12,194 --> 01:17:16,006
你說得對 我的確是想要傾訴
You were right. I guess I had some stuff to say.

982
01:17:18,433 --> 01:17:20,936
顯然 有很多東西想要表達
Apparently, a lot of stuff.

983
01:17:23,038 --> 01:17:24,784
不管怎樣 你現在知道我的想法 
Anyway, now you know what's on my mind, 

984
01:17:24,784 --> 01:17:26,509
這樣就可以寫演講稿了
so you can write my speech.

985
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:28,485
不行
No.

986
01:17:28,577 --> 01:17:31,217
我想我已經正式退出代寫這一行了
I think I'm officially out of that business.

987
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:32,791
你還欠我一篇演講稿
You owe me.

988
01:17:36,084 --> 01:17:38,257
這是你為我畫的
You made this for me.

989
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,695
昨天畫的
Yesterday.

990
01:17:41,423 --> 01:17:43,061
為什麼呢
How come?

991
01:17:43,191 --> 01:17:45,193
因為牆上的內容遠遠要多於
Because there's more that belongs on a wall than,

992
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:49,206
"諾拉有個死鬼哥哥"
"Norah has a dead brother. "

993
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:52,777
即使是一團亂
Even if it is a big mess.

994
01:17:54,469 --> 01:17:55,777
畫得很好啊
It's amazing.

995
01:17:57,706 --> 01:18:01,677
有意思 我覺得畫了坨屎 你覺得畫得很好
Funny. I think it's a mess, and you think it's amazing.

996
01:18:01,743 --> 01:18:04,417
我覺得你很棒 你卻覺得自己什麼都不是
And I think you're amazing, and you think you're a mess.

997
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:10,088
你知道麼 我不想再思考了
You know what? I don't want to think anymore.

998
01:18:15,223 --> 01:18:17,669
你仍欠我一篇演講稿
You still owe me a speech.

999
01:18:18,393 --> 01:18:20,532
一定要保證像我的口氣
Just make sure it sounds like me.

1000
01:18:27,836 --> 01:18:32,649
那麼我是坐這寫然後再被逮捕一次呢
So, do I just sit here writing and get arrested again?

1001
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:35,279
不用 你拿走吧 笨蛋
No, take it with you, dummy.

1002
01:18:35,677 --> 01:18:38,624
我拿走?
Take it with me?

1003
01:19:23,892 --> 01:19:26,998
畢業生們 死去的詩人們
Good afternoon, graduates, dead poets,

1004
01:19:27,129 --> 01:19:31,373
畫家們 未來的愛因斯坦們 下午好
painters, future Einsteins, and all those in between.

1005
01:19:31,867 --> 01:19:35,212
今天我站在這裡 警告大家有人在對你們說謊
Today I'm here to warn you that you are being lied to.

1006
01:19:35,337 --> 01:19:40,218
父母 老師 醫生都對我們撒了謊
Our parents, our teachers, our doctors have lied to us.

1007
01:19:40,308 --> 01:19:45,417
說的都是同一句謊言 就6個字
And it's the exact same lie. The same six words,

1008
01:19:45,514 --> 01:19:47,994
"一切都會好的"
"Everything is going to be okay. "

1009
01:19:50,018 --> 01:19:51,793
但要是好不了呢
But what if it isn't?

1010
01:19:53,288 --> 01:19:55,894
要是有些體驗是遺傳來的
What if some of human experience is just something you inherit,

1011
01:19:55,957 --> 01:19:58,767
就像卷髮或是碧眼一樣
like curly hair or blue eyes?

1012
01:19:58,827 --> 01:20:03,503
要是你生來就痛苦 生來就是一樁悲劇呢
What if pain is just in your DNA and tragedy is your birthright?

1013
01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:05,934
又或者
Or what if..

1014
01:20:06,001 --> 01:20:08,777
或者有時      有時
"Or what if sometimes... "        ... sometimes...

1015
01:20:08,937 --> 01:20:11,816
...突然之間 它成了你的最低期望
"... right out of the blue, when you least expect it,

1016
01:20:12,674 --> 01:20:15,120
破事就發生了呢
"shit just happens?

1017
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:19,221
破事就發生了呢
"Shit just happens. "

1018
01:20:22,217 --> 01:20:24,163
好吧 我保證 現在大家都在想
Okay, I'm sure, right now, you're all thinking,

1019
01:20:24,219 --> 01:20:27,108
靠 這是我聽過的最黑暗的畢業生演講
"Man, this is the darkest graduation speech I've ever heard. "

1020
01:20:27,722 --> 01:20:30,703
是的 我同意你們的意見 但這不是我寫的
And it is. I agree with you, but I didn't write it.

1021
01:20:35,063 --> 01:20:40,172
我花了很長時間等待謊言成真
I've spent so much time waiting for this lie to come true

1022
01:20:40,235 --> 01:20:43,910
所以我付錢讓別人來替我說出真相
that I finally paid someone to tell the truth for me.

1023
01:20:47,342 --> 01:20:48,878
我並不好
I'm not okay.

1024
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:50,890
一點都不好
Not at all.

1025
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:55,557
真相是
The truth is,

1026
01:20:55,617 --> 01:20:57,893
我缺失了一樣東西
I'm missing something,

1027
01:20:59,588 --> 01:21:01,124
是我的最愛
the thing I loved the most,

1028
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:05,371
是一張我希望他就在前排坐著的面龐
the face I wish were in the front row right now.

1029
01:21:07,729 --> 01:21:10,437
我永遠都回不來的哥哥
The brother I'll never get back.

1030
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:17,608
那麼我該怎麼做
So what do I do with that?

1031
01:21:21,243 --> 01:21:23,314
我們大家會怎麼做
What do any of us do,

1032
01:21:24,246 --> 01:21:26,248
除了說謊以外
besides lie?

1033
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:31,690
我相信的是
This is what I believe.

1034
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:40,035
現在禮堂裡 有人正與你一起
Right now, in this auditorium, there is someone who is with you.

1035
01:21:40,095 --> 01:21:44,475
他願意來接你 彈去你身上的灰塵
Someone who is willing to pick you up, dust you off,

1036
01:21:44,532 --> 01:21:45,806
親吻你 原諒你
kiss you, forgive you,

1037
01:21:46,768 --> 01:21:50,079
容忍你 等著你 陪著你
put up with you, wait for you, carry you,

1038
01:21:50,438 --> 01:21:51,849
愛著你
love you.

1039
01:21:54,175 --> 01:21:57,019
雖然事事不會一直都順利
So, while everything may not always be okay,

1040
01:21:57,946 --> 01:22:00,119
但有一點我相信是真的
one thing I know is true.

1041
01:22:01,783 --> 01:22:04,195
你沒有必要一個人戰鬥
You do not have to be alone.

1042
01:22:46,661 --> 01:22:49,141
我沒想到你會來
I didn't think you'd come.

1043
01:22:49,397 --> 01:22:51,775
我也沒想到自己會來
I didn't think I would, either.

1044
01:22:59,574 --> 01:23:01,451
我很高興你還活著
I'm just glad you're still here.

1045
01:23:03,311 --> 01:23:05,188
我身體的大部分是還活著
Yeah, most of me, anyway.

1046
01:23:05,780 --> 01:23:07,316
嗯
Yeah.

1047
01:23:12,454 --> 01:23:14,434
你知道嗎 我還是個孩子的時候
You know, when I was a little kid,

1048
01:23:14,923 --> 01:23:18,336
我滿心期望就是像你一樣
man, all I ever wanted was to be like you.

1049
01:23:21,396 --> 01:23:22,875
之後我長大了
Then I got older,

1050
01:23:25,533 --> 01:23:28,309
我又想成為別人
and I just wanted to be anybody else.

1051
01:23:35,043 --> 01:23:36,044
現在呢
And now?

1052
01:23:42,517 --> 01:23:43,621
爸爸
Dad.

1053
01:24:41,309 --> 01:24:43,755
這是沃特·布萊克現在的寫照
This is a picture of Walter Black,

1054
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:48,120
他曾不得不成為海貍先生

1055
01:24:48,183 --> 01:24:50,663
也不得不為人父
who had to become a father,

1056
01:24:51,953 --> 01:24:53,337
因此有朝一日 
so that, one day, 

1057
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:57,461
這可能正是沃特·布萊克一生的寫照
