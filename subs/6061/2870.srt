- 为什么她今晚要来？
- <u>阿米尔</u>要带她来。

129
00:05:28,046 --> 00:05:30,845
Beats me, because Amir's a total jackass.
我不懂，<u>阿米尔</u>十足是个白痴。

130
00:05:30,846 --> 00:05:32,046
Oh.
噢。

131
00:05:32,047 --> 00:05:34,679
You know what? Put a quarter
into the swear jar.
你知道吗？罚你往
脏话罐里投两毛五分钱。

We got an e-mail about it.
Just his plus one.
我们收的电子邮件里说的，
说他要“再加个人”。

00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,117
Plus one and then I
was, like, plus what?
“再加个人”，然后我的

I need to know tonight?

My editor needs to know how
to book hotels and flights.
我的编辑需要了解

I gotta do it.
Let them know.

a little bit longer because...

I just don't want to make the wrong choice.
我真的不想做出错误的选择。

144
00:06:11,179 --> 00:06:12,945
What if you came for a shorter time?
那你来的时间短一点如何？

145
00:06:12,946 --> 00:06:16,354
Like a month, not the full four months.
Just come for a month.
比如说一个月，而不是
整四个月，就来一个月？

146
00:06:16,436 --> 00:06:18,083
It's still a very long time...
那也很长了…

147
00:06:18,123 --> 00:06:19,778
and I'm not saying no.
我并没有说“不行”。

148
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:24,746
Babe, if you don't say yes,
it becomes a no.
宝贝，如果你不说“行”，

174
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,813
Does everyone else still not have service?

175
00:07:27,844 --> 00:07:30,410
My phone is completely broken.

I'm living in the moment, but...

I read something this morning
about a comet in the 1930s.
我今天上午读到篇有关

- 唔…

It was actually crazy,
because it affected the people.
实际上那事很荒唐，
因为它影响到了人。

192
00:08:12,676 --> 00:08:15,647
After it passed, they would get lost.
彗星过去后，人们都迷失了。

193
00:08:15,677 --> 00:08:18,275
They would end up in the wrong home.
They would forget things.
最后他们有没呆在自己家里的，

00:08:18,276 --> 00:08:20,343
They wouldn't really know where they were.

right there in front in them.
就站在他们面前。

205
00:08:42,676 --> 00:08:44,741
Do they have any theories of why?
有什么解释吗为什么会这样？

206
00:08:44,742 --> 00:08:47,973
Think how lucky she is.
She gets to kill him again.
想想她多幸运啊，
可以再杀他一次。

207
00:08:47,974 --> 00:08:49,607
Clearly she wants to kill this man.
显然她想杀死这个男人。

208
00:08:49,608 --> 00:08:51,208

The Finns or Finnish?

I mean, it was such a big deal.
我是说，那在当时可是大事。
【应该是指1986年的回归】

212
00:08:57,243 --> 00:09:01,007
I remember at my school, we all had
to, like, reenact Halley's Comet.
我记得在我们学校，我们都要
参与模拟<u>哈雷</u>彗星的回归。

213
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:04,907
So, they assigned each of us
something celestial to do.
所以他们分派给我们
每个人扮演某个天体。

214
00:09:04,908 --> 00:09:07,375
My sister got to be Halley's Comet.
I was very jealous.
我姐姐正好扮演<u>哈雷</u>彗星，

我从没见过你姐姐。
你们有谁见过她姐姐吗？

那儿有张她的照片，
就在壁炉架上面，但…

- she looks a little ridiculous.
- 她只是个飞逝而过的彗星。
- …她看上去有点可笑。

- But why did you put it...
- 那是你姐姐？

219
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,407
It's the door to nowhere.
那道门不通向任何地方。

220
00:09:18,408 --> 00:09:20,241
In feng shui, a useless door,
根据风水，一道无用之门，

221
00:09:20,242 --> 00:09:21,841
which this is obviously a useless door,

and it causes all
of this weird energy flow.

225
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,972
I don't even like being over here.
我都不想靠近这儿。

226

- 很可怕，真的……
- 那你不该在那儿。

227
00:09:32,741 --> 00:09:34,306

- I'm sort of an empath.
- 每次你这样说……
- 我好像具有神入的本领。

228

but not everybody could be.
我们中大部分都在那儿，

232
00:09:45,908 --> 00:09:47,540
I don't think Laurie...
Laura?
我觉得<u>劳瑞</u>就没…
还是<u>劳拉</u>？

233
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:48,904
- Laurie.
- Laurie.
- <u>劳瑞</u>。
- <u>劳瑞</u>。

234
00:09:48,905 --> 00:09:51,072

all these stories.

自己的故事，

We do that when we get together.

不好意思，这可能有点像那种
你明明认识某个角色…

00:11:02,071 --> 00:11:05,371
the character for so long, then you see
someone in person. It just doesn't compute.
…很长时间了，但当你见到

creating the dance show.
…一定是我在创作

really well for a while,
那部戏一开始都进展得

and they just offered me the understudy.

She should've been the whole thing.

- That's terrible.

that I had to learn, because...
不过我好像从这件事中
学到了不少教训，因为…

I didn't want...
你知道，因为我的骄傲，

to take the understudy
and I took too long...
…接受替补的角色，

to think about it and then
I lost the understudy job.
…太长的时间以至于

And they gave that to
Katherine Meriss and...
他们把替补给了

总之，为什么现在

298
00:12:31,104 --> 00:12:33,002
is because she ended up going up.

Svetlana pulled out last minute...

person in dance I'd know."

your... your whole thing?

There's a massive celestial object,

and I didn't want to freak you out.

- Now you're freaking me out.
- You guys realize...
- 现在你吓到我了。

I was on a show called Roswell...
…我演过的剧叫《<u>罗斯韦尔</u>》，

and we tackled these issues every week.
我们每星期都在应付这些问题。

372
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,598
That's true.
那倒是的。

373
00:15:38,365 --> 00:15:40,231
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God.
- 噢，见鬼。
- 噢，我的天哪。

374
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:42,197
- Honey.
- Um, I'm on it.

Do we have candles?

I'm so glad I'm not high.

378
00:15:48,965 --> 00:15:52,465
Mike, check the breakers.
<u>迈克</u>，检查一下电门保险。

379
00:15:52,466 --> 00:15:54,897
I'm going to turn the lighter on
then come to you.
我要去开荧光棒，
然后来找你们。

380

- No. I have matches.
- 你们有谁需要帮忙？
- 不用，我有火柴。

381
00:15:57,764 --> 00:16:00,432
- Candle power?
- I've got some over here.
- 烛光？
- 我已经在这里找到一些。

382
00:16:00,433 --> 00:16:03,930
I got blue glowsticks, red
glowsticks and green glowsticks.
我这儿有蓝荧光棒、
红荧光棒、和绿荧光棒。

383
00:16:03,931 --> 00:16:06,696
Guys, let's just light candles and...
各位，我们还是点蜡烛吧……

384
00:16:06,697 --> 00:16:08,664
Oh.
噢。

385
00:16:08,665 --> 00:16:10,764
- Hey.
- Everybody rave.
- 嘿。

What do you mean, you're going outside?
什么意思，你们要出去？

I'm gonna see if the power's
off in the whole neighborhood.
我想去看一下整个这附近
是否也停电了。

389
00:16:22,798 --> 00:16:24,598
I decided this is where mine goes.
我决定我的就放这儿了。

390
00:16:25,597 --> 00:16:27,464
Well, this is a little strange,
唔，这事有点奇怪，

391
00:16:27,465 --> 00:16:29,330
but the whole neighborhood is out...
整个这附近都停电了，

392
00:16:29,331 --> 00:16:32,329
of power, except for a house
about two blocks up,
除了两街区外的一所房子，

393
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,831
which is completely lit up.

394
00:16:33,832 --> 00:16:35,563
It's kind of beautiful, actually.
还蛮漂亮的，说实话。

395
00:16:35,564 --> 00:16:38,297
- The house?
- I want to go see.
- 房子？
- 我也想去看看。

396
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:42,030
- Let's go check it out.
- I've never seen it so dark outside before.
- 我们都去看看吧。
- 以前从没见过外面这么黑的。

00:16:42,031 --> 00:16:44,297
- You can't leave me. I'm gonna go.
- Come on then.
- 你们不能撇下我，我也要去。

398
00:16:44,298 --> 00:16:45,862
Don't leave me by myself.
别把我一个人留下。

399
00:16:46,063 --> 00:16:48,863
- Where?
- You don't see it?
- 在哪儿？
- 你没看见吗？

400
00:16:48,864 --> 00:16:51,464
- It's right there.
- Why are you so far ahead of everyone?
- 就在那儿。
- 你为什么一个人跑那么快？

401
00:16:51,465 --> 00:16:53,497
Amir, dude, I can't see you.
<u>阿米尔</u>，老兄，我看不见你。

- Let Laurie go first.
- Thanks a lot.
- 让<u>劳瑞</u>先走。

- 你太好了。

- Come here.
- See? Look.
- 到这边来。

405
00:17:00,496 --> 00:17:02,567
- Everything done.

- 过来。

406
00:17:05,564 --> 00:17:07,064
See that?
看到那没有？

407
00:17:08,063 --> 00:17:10,430
- Two blocks down.
- Oh, they have light.
- 两个街区之外。
- 噢，他们有光。

408
00:17:10,431 --> 00:17:13,229
- That one house has light.
- They must have a...
- 只有一家有光。
- 他们一定有……

409
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,863
- A generator, or something?
- Yeah, yeah.
- 发电机之类的？
- 是的，是的。

410
00:17:14,864 --> 00:17:16,495
What is that, two blocks away?
那有多远，隔两个街区？

411
00:17:16,496 --> 00:17:17,995
Could solar power do that?
可能是用太阳能吗？

412
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:20,395
But would their landline be working?
他们的座机会能用吗？

413
00:17:20,396 --> 00:17:21,862
Oh, wow. Look at that.
噢，哇哦！你看那儿！

414
00:17:21,863 --> 00:17:25,263
- Oh, wow.
- It's magnificent.
- 噢，哇哦！
- 太壮观了！

415
00:17:25,264 --> 00:17:26,699
Holy moly.
老天爷啊！

416
00:17:30,695 --> 00:17:32,229
Well, I'm freezing.
我冻死了。

417
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,929
Should we head over there, or should we...
我们是过去看看呢还是……

418
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:36,913
- No.
- Maybe we should head back inside.
- 不。
- 也许我该回屋里去了。

419
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,409
That was awesome, right?
那太棒了，对吗？

420
00:17:43,123 --> 00:17:45,594
- I didn't even see this get knocked over.
- No.
- 我怎么没注意这杯子碎了。
- 是啊。

421
00:17:45,595 --> 00:17:47,396
I didn't even know that glass was out here.
我都不记得这玻璃杯刚才在这儿。

422
00:17:47,397 --> 00:17:48,962
I never go down into the basement.
我决不去地下室。

423
00:17:48,963 --> 00:17:51,929
Guys, listen. Seriously,
what's up with that house?
各位，听着：说真的，
那所房子是怎么回事？

424
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,661
- Why are they...?
- What?
- 为什么他们……？
- 什么？

425
00:17:53,662 --> 00:17:55,397
It could be a generator.
可能他们用了发电机。

426
00:17:55,528 --> 00:17:56,129
Really?
真的吗？

427
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,828
I don't know. Maybe they're
just off-the-grid bastard...
我不知道，也许那帮混蛋
压根没用这个电网……

428
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:00,261
Well, apparently, we have a generator.
显然，我们也有发电机。

429
00:18:00,262 --> 00:18:02,385
That would make sense if
they were off the grid.
如果他们没用我们的电网，
那就说得通了。

430
00:18:02,386 --> 00:18:06,494
I'm actually thinking of...
of going over there.
我其实在想…
想要过去看看。

431
00:18:06,495 --> 00:18:07,927
What?
什么？

432
00:18:07,928 --> 00:18:10,562
- No, you're not going over there.
- Honey, it's okay.
- 不，你不能过去。
- 亲爱的，没事的。

433
00:18:10,563 --> 00:18:13,027
- It's o...
- It's ridiculous.
- 没什么……
- 太荒唐了。

434
00:18:13,028 --> 00:18:15,560
It's not that far.
Look, look, look, look.
那儿没多远。
你看，你看。

435
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,993
My brother, he says...
我弟弟，他说…

436
00:18:17,994 --> 00:18:21,694
he said that if... if anything
strange were to happen...
他说如果…如果
在彗星经过时…

437
00:18:21,695 --> 00:18:24,061
while the comet was passing over...
发生了什么奇怪的事，

438
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:27,394
- that we should stay inside.
- What?
- 我们应该呆在房间里。
- 什么？

439
00:18:27,395 --> 00:18:28,995
Just hold on, Amir.
等一下，<u>阿米尔</u>。

440
00:18:28,996 --> 00:18:32,727
That we should stay inside and that
I should do my best to contact him.
他说我们应该呆在房间里，
而我应该尽力和他联系。

441
00:18:32,728 --> 00:18:34,226
And so that's all that I'm doing.
这就是我正在做的。

442
00:18:34,227 --> 00:18:38,394
He said if anything strange
should happen? I mean...
他说过会发生奇怪的事吗？
我是说……

443
00:18:38,395 --> 00:18:41,194
I'm not the only one who
thinks this is strange.
不止我一个人觉得这事很奇怪。

444
00:18:41,195 --> 00:18:43,127
- What is weird?
- Didn't he say to stay inside though?
- 什么很奇怪？
- 他说过要呆在房间里吗？

445
00:18:43,128 --> 00:18:45,193
What's more important than the other?
所以重要的是要呆在房间里？

446
00:18:45,194 --> 00:18:48,094
Yes, but this overrides that,
and it's only two blocks away.
是的，但这比那还重要，
再说那儿只隔了两个街区。

447
00:18:48,095 --> 00:18:50,294
I'll be back in, like, five minutes.
我会在，多少，五分钟内返回。

448
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:53,060
- Well, then you can't go by yourself.
- I'm going with him.
- 好吧，要去你自己去吧。
- 我和他一起去。

449
00:18:53,261 --> 00:18:55,727
There you go. I'll take Amir.
好的，我带上<u>阿米尔</u>。

450
00:18:55,728 --> 00:18:58,093
- I'm the least important person here.
- This is true.
- 我是这里最微不足道的人。
- 那倒是的。

451
00:18:58,094 --> 00:18:59,826
It's about time you started realizing that.
是到了你开始意识到这点的时候了。

452
00:18:59,827 --> 00:19:02,560
- Just stay here.
- Why are you going now?
- 就呆在这儿。
- 你为什么现在去？

453
00:19:02,561 --> 00:19:05,260
Well, bring your glowsticks
so we can identify your bodies.
好吧，拿上你们的荧光棒，
好让我们辨别你们的身份。

454
00:19:05,261 --> 00:19:07,112
- Good idea.
- Thanks. That helps a lot.
- 好主意。
- 谢谢，那帮了大忙。

455
00:19:07,495 --> 00:19:09,493
- Don't listen to them.
- That's great.
- 别听他们的。
- 太好了。

456
00:19:09,494 --> 00:19:10,994
Five minutes, all right?
就五分钟，行吗？

457
00:19:10,995 --> 00:19:12,726
- Okay. Five minutes.
- All right. Okay.
- 好吧，五分钟。
- 好的，没问题。

458
00:19:12,727 --> 00:19:14,527
Beth, I-I couldn't find my shoes.
<u>贝思</u>，我…我找不到我的鞋了。

459
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,994
I'm borrowing yours. I'm sorry.
我借你的穿，对不起。

460
00:19:15,995 --> 00:19:18,129
That's so Amir.
真是太<u>阿米尔</u>了。

461
00:19:19,628 --> 00:19:22,761
- Ten minutes we give them.
- They will be fine.
- 十分钟我们给他们。
- 他们没事的。

462
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:25,926
We're just rattled because we're
addicted to cell phones and Internet.
我们这么慌乱是因为我们
太离不开手机和因特网了。

463
00:19:25,927 --> 00:19:28,159
We are. What did we do before cell phones?
是的，在有手机前我们做什么？

464
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,627
Em, you seem to be the
comet expert here tonight.
<u>艾米</u>，你好像是
今晚这里的彗星专家，

465
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,192
What happened the last time?
上一次发生过什么？

466
00:19:33,193 --> 00:19:36,159
This one passed over a hundred
years ago, but much farther.
这颗彗星一百年前
经过过，只是远得多。

467
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,559
But do we know that anything happened?
但我们知道发生过什么事吗？

468
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,959
Nothing happened then.
It was too far away.
当时什么事都没发生，
它距离太远了。

469
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,659
So, is there any reason...
那这一次有没有理由…

470
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,160
we should be freaked out right now?
…我们应该感到担心呢？

471
00:19:44,161 --> 00:19:47,625
Well, I mean, it is
a lot closer this time.
唔，我想说，
这一次它近了好多。

472
00:19:47,626 --> 00:19:49,525
What does that mean?
那意味着什么呢？

473
00:19:49,526 --> 00:19:51,246
Okay. I read one more thing.
好吧，我还读过一篇文章。

474
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:54,126
- Oh, another story.
- Just one more.
- 噢，又要讲故事。
- 再讲一个。

475
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:55,891
It's called the Tunguska Event...
它叫“<u>通古斯</u>事件”，

476
00:19:55,892 --> 00:19:58,926
and, um, it was a comet...
唔，那是颗彗星…

477
00:19:58,927 --> 00:20:00,826
or a meteor or something like that...
…或是一颗流星或诸如此类的…

478
00:20:00,827 --> 00:20:03,491
that entered the atmosphere over Siberia...
进入了<u>西伯利亚</u>上空的大气层，

479
00:20:03,492 --> 00:20:06,325
and exploded over Earth.
然后在地面之上爆炸。

480
00:20:06,326 --> 00:20:08,825
So, it didn't actually have physical impact.
所以，其实它没有物理上的碰撞，

481
00:20:08,826 --> 00:20:10,758
It didn't touch Earth.
它没有触到地球，

482
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:12,198
It didn't leave a crater or anything,
没有留下环形山之类的东西，

483
00:20:12,393 --> 00:20:14,824
but the force of that explosion...
但是那个爆炸的力量…

484
00:20:14,825 --> 00:20:18,625
flattened trees for hundreds of miles.
…削平了数百英里的树木，

485
00:20:18,626 --> 00:20:21,891
But it only killed about one to two people.
但只杀死了一两个人。

486
00:20:21,892 --> 00:20:24,824
It's Siberia. There were
probably only two people there.
那是<u>西伯利亚</u>，
可能那里也就只有两个人。

487
00:20:24,825 --> 00:20:26,424
Yeah, but they don't necessarily...
是啊，但他们不一定……

488
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,891
- It wiped out the population of Siberia.
- Basically. Yeah.
- 它清除了<u>西伯利亚</u>的人口。
- 大致上，是的。

489
00:20:28,892 --> 00:20:30,624
- Right.
- Well, that doesn't make me feel better.
- 是的。

- Two guys staying here? Please?
- I'm staying, I'm staying.
- 两个男人留在这里？拜托？
- 我留下，我留下。

735
00:32:04,676 --> 00:32:07,442
Are you going? Amir, please.
你也要去吗？<u>阿米尔</u>，求你了。

736
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:08,974
Let's go.
我们走吧。

737
00:32:08,975 --> 00:32:10,408
So, what? We're splitting up again?
怎么？我们又要分开吗？

738
00:32:10,409 --> 00:32:11,674
No. We're not splitting up.
不，我们没有分开，

739
00:32:11,675 --> 00:32:14,740
- We're just gonna go in two different groups.
- Oh. Okay.
- 我们只是分成了两个组。
- 噢，好啊。

740
00:32:14,741 --> 00:32:16,351
Sticks, sticks, sticks.
荧光棒，荧光棒，荧光棒。

741
00:32:16,642 --> 00:32:18,342
Do we need a towel on it?
需要裹个毛巾在上面吗？

742
00:32:18,343 --> 00:32:20,573
I'm coming. Wait.
我来了，等一等。

743
00:32:20,574 --> 00:32:22,773
Chill for a second. I'm coming.
别那么急啊，我来了。

744
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,300
- Why?
- Because I want to go.
- 怎么？
- 因为我也想去。

745
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:26,878
I'm going with Kevin.
我要和<u>凯文</u>一起去。

746
00:32:29,975 --> 00:32:32,708
- Give us 20 minutes.
- All right.
- 给我们20分钟。
- 好的。

747
00:32:32,709 --> 00:32:35,207
- And then what?
- Are we taking the bat?
- 那然后呢？
- 要带上棒球棒吗？

748
00:32:35,208 --> 00:32:37,841
- No. We'll be fine.
- You will be fine. It's gonna be all right.
- 不，我们会没事的。
- 你们会没事的，一切都会好的。

749
00:32:37,842 --> 00:32:39,618
We'll find out what's going on.
我们去看看究竟怎么回事。

750
00:32:48,609 --> 00:32:51,760
No cars. No people.
There's nothing.
没有车子，没有人。
什么都没有。

751
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,139
Guys, look.
各位，你们看。

752
00:33:14,574 --> 00:33:16,743
That's my house.
那是我家房子。

753
00:33:17,942 --> 00:33:21,210
- Mike.
- This is my house.
- <u>迈克</u>。
- 这是我家房子。

754
00:33:24,207 --> 00:33:26,006
Mike, this isn't right.
<u>迈克</u>，这不对劲。

755
00:33:26,007 --> 00:33:28,472
Mike, this is not your house.
<u>迈克</u>，这不是你家房子。

756
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:30,277
Mike.
<u>迈克</u>。

757
00:33:32,275 --> 00:33:34,506
- My house.
- This is not your house, Mike.
- 是我的房子。
- 这不是你的房子，<u>迈克</u>。

758
00:33:34,507 --> 00:33:37,705
Mike. This is not your house.
<u>迈克</u>，这不是你家的房子。

759
00:33:37,706 --> 00:33:40,509
What is he doing? Kevin.
他想干嘛？<u>凯文</u>。

760
00:33:42,506 --> 00:33:46,208
I see... I see Lee. Guys.
我看见…我看见<u>李</u>了，各位。

761
00:33:47,207 --> 00:33:50,639
- We have to go.
- Let's get out of here now.
- 我们得走了。
- 我们赶紧离开这里。

762
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,804
Mike, we need to get
the hell out of here.
<u>迈克</u>，我们得赶紧
他妈的离开这里。

763
00:33:52,805 --> 00:33:53,604
Someone's coming.
有人过来了。

764
00:33:54,506 --> 00:33:56,825
Someone's coming. Go. Just go.
有人来了。走，快走。

765
00:34:41,572 --> 00:34:43,173
That's just nuts.
这太荒唐了。

766
00:34:45,771 --> 00:34:48,570
So, you saw four figures,
same as you?
这么说你们看见了四个人，
和你们一样？

767
00:34:48,571 --> 00:34:51,670
Except they had red glowsticks.
除了他们拿的是红荧光棒。

768
00:34:51,671 --> 00:34:53,804
Who had red glowsticks?
谁拿着红荧光棒？

769
00:34:53,905 --> 00:34:55,403
They had the red glowsticks.
他们拿着红荧光棒。

770
00:34:55,404 --> 00:34:58,203
We had the blue glowsticks.
That was the only difference.
我们拿着蓝荧光棒。
这是唯一的区别。

771
00:34:58,204 --> 00:35:00,771
So, they must've opened the red
box when the lights went out.
所以在停电的时候，
他们一定打开了红色的箱子。

772
00:35:00,772 --> 00:35:03,462
- And you didn't say anything to them?
- Would you?
- 你们没跟他们说任何话吗？
- 要是你你会吗？

773
00:35:03,472 --> 00:35:05,103
No, I wouldn't.
不，我不会。

774
00:35:05,104 --> 00:35:07,704
I think I would've thought I was
going to die, or something.
我觉得我一定会以为
自己要死过去了。

775
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:09,637
Okay, okay. So, that's it?
行了，行了。所以，就这些了？

776
00:35:09,638 --> 00:35:12,570
Well, that and there's
this weird zone...
唔，除了这些还有一处
很诡异的地带……

777
00:35:12,571 --> 00:35:14,436
that's even darker than the rest of it all.
那儿比别的任何地方都黑。

778
00:35:14,437 --> 00:35:16,338
We went through that.
我们经过过那里。

779
00:35:16,439 --> 00:35:18,570
We went through that
when we went down there.
我们去那儿的时候
也经过过那里。

780
00:35:18,571 --> 00:35:20,937
We need to find out what's going on.
我们需要搞清这是怎么回事。

781
00:35:20,938 --> 00:35:23,369
- The Internet's down. We don't have...
- We can't just sit here.
- 因特网上不了，我们没有……
- 我们不能只是干坐着。

782
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:25,771
What else?
Do you guys have any...
还有别的什么吗？
你们有没有任何……

783
00:35:25,772 --> 00:35:27,637
Do you have books?
你有书吗？

784
00:35:27,638 --> 00:35:29,069
Books on what? Books on comets?
什么样的书？讲彗星的书？

785
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,704
Comets, gravity, black holes...
什么都行，彗星、引力、黑洞……

786
00:35:30,705 --> 00:35:33,669
Yeah, I've got Shakespeare, some
Henry Miller and some screenplays.
是啊，我有<u>莎士比亚</u>、
几本<u>亨利</u>・<u>米勒</u>和一些剧本。

787
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,370
Dude, I'm a fucking actor.
老哥，我他妈的是演员。

788
00:35:35,371 --> 00:35:37,670
Anything about quantum physics?
有量子物理的吗？

789
00:35:37,671 --> 00:35:40,236
Yeah, that's right up my alley.
是啊，那是我的拿手好戏。

790
00:35:40,437 --> 00:35:42,902
Some actors read.
有的演员什么都读。

791
00:35:42,903 --> 00:35:46,036
Your brother left a book at our house and...
你弟弟把一本书落在我们家了……

792
00:35:46,037 --> 00:35:47,369
What?
什么？

793
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,103
I put it in an envelope to mail,
我把它放进信封里要寄给他，

794
00:35:49,104 --> 00:35:50,970
but I-I put it in your car.
但我…我放在你车的后座上了。

795
00:35:50,971 --> 00:35:53,002
- And it's about?
- I don't know what it's about.
- 关于什么的？
- 我不知道那书关于什么。

796
00:35:53,003 --> 00:35:54,670
- Comets?
- It's just one of his books.
- 彗星吗？
- 那只是他的一本书。

797
00:35:54,671 --> 00:35:56,435
It's always about stuff like that.
他的书都是那一类的。

798
00:35:56,436 --> 00:35:59,569
Yeah, I will... I will go get
the book I don't know about.
是啊，我要…我要去取
这本我不知道的书。

799
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:02,503
- Can somebody go with him?
- Could you bring the bat?
- 有谁能陪他一起去吗？
- 你是不是带上球棒？

800
00:36:02,504 --> 00:36:04,803
- Yeah.
- Yes. That's a good idea.
- 好的。
- 是啊，这是个好主意。

801
00:36:04,804 --> 00:36:07,138
Please be careful, babe.
请多加小心，宝贝。

802
00:36:08,137 --> 00:36:09,869
Okay.
好吧。

803
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,702
Should we wake up Lee?
我们该叫醒<u>李</u>了吗？

804
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:15,669
How could she go to sleep
in the middle of all this?
在这样的情境中
她怎么能睡得着的？

805
00:36:16,437 --> 00:36:18,572
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, babe.
对不起。对不起，宝贝。

806
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:22,235
Jesus. Calm down, everybody.
天哪，镇静，各位。

807
00:36:22,236 --> 00:36:23,767
Oh, baby.
噢，宝贝。

808
00:36:23,768 --> 00:36:26,209
I was gonna mail it back to him.
我本打算寄还给他的。

809
00:36:31,503 --> 00:36:32,902
What is it?
是什么书？

810
00:36:32,903 --> 00:36:36,801
"Gravitation: An Introduction
To Current Research."
《引力：研究趋势简介》。

811
00:36:36,802 --> 00:36:38,468
That's not gonna apply.
好像没什么用。

812
00:36:38,469 --> 00:36:41,254
So, is his brother like
a scientist, or something?
这么说，他弟弟是科学家还是什么人？

813
00:36:41,255 --> 00:36:42,635
He's just a really trippy guy.
他真的是个怪家伙。

814
00:36:42,636 --> 00:36:44,402
He's really, really smart,
a real egghead.
他真的真的很聪明，
真正的学者。

815
00:36:44,403 --> 00:36:47,968
But it's hard to...
It's like he thinks out loud.
但是很难……
好像他总是在那儿思考。

816
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:51,292
- He's a teacher at U.C.S.D.
- What do you got, Hugh?
- 他是<u>加</u>大<u>圣迭戈</u>分校的老师。
- 你看出什么了，<u>休</u>？

817
00:36:51,369 --> 00:36:53,534
This is...
这是……

818
00:36:53,535 --> 00:36:57,568
These are Brian's notes from
his lesson plan for his class.
这些是<u>布赖恩</u>讲课用的
课堂提纲笔记。

819
00:36:57,569 --> 00:37:01,202
"Decoherence and Schroedinger's Cat."
He talked about this.
“退相干以及<u>薛定谔</u>之猫”，
他谈起过这个。

820
00:37:01,203 --> 00:37:04,734
- Do you guys know what Schroedinger's cat is?
- I'm allergic.
- 你们都知道什么是<u>薛定谔</u>之猫吗？
- 我猫过敏。

821
00:37:04,735 --> 00:37:08,168
So, it's a, um...
It's a thought experiment.
这是个，呃…
这是个思想实验。

822
00:37:08,169 --> 00:37:09,934
There's a... There's a cat in a box...
有一只…有一只处在盒子里的猫，

823
00:37:09,935 --> 00:37:12,933
that has, like, a 50/50 chance of living...
它有一半对一半的存活几率，

824
00:37:12,934 --> 00:37:14,534
because there's a vial of poison...
因为有一小瓶毒药…

825
00:37:14,535 --> 00:37:16,134
that's also in the box.
…也在这个盒子里。

826
00:37:16,135 --> 00:37:19,699
So, regular physics would say
that it's one or the other.
所以常规的物理学
会告诉我们非此即彼――

827
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,202
That the cat is either alive or dead.
猫要么活着要么死了。

828
00:37:21,203 --> 00:37:24,034
But Brian would argue
that quantum physics says...
但<u>布赖恩</u>会说
量子物理告诉我们…

829
00:37:24,035 --> 00:37:27,000
that both realities exist simultaneously.
…这两种现实同时存在。

830
00:37:27,001 --> 00:37:30,534
It's only when you open the box
that they collapse...
只有当你打开这个盒子时，
这两种现实才会坍缩到…

831
00:37:30,535 --> 00:37:32,634
into a single event. Right?
…单一的事件。明白吗？

832
00:37:32,635 --> 00:37:35,767
So, listen to this.
This is what he's written.
所以，听听这个，
这是他写下的：

833
00:37:35,768 --> 00:37:37,467
"There is another theory:
“还存在另一种理论：

834
00:37:37,468 --> 00:37:39,534
that two states continue to exist...
“两种状态继续存在，

835
00:37:39,535 --> 00:37:41,701
separate and decoherent from each other,
“但彼此之间相互分离互不相干，

836
00:37:41,702 --> 00:37:44,332
each creating a new branch of reality...
“基于这两种结果，每一种…

837
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:46,166
based on the two outcomes.
“…都创造出一支新的现实。

838
00:37:46,167 --> 00:37:48,999
Quantum decoherence ensures
that the different outcomes...
“量子退相干保证了
这两种不同的结果…

839
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,800
have no interaction with each other."
“…不会再有任何的相互作用。”

840
00:37:51,801 --> 00:37:54,066
- Hold on.
- Well, that explains it.
- 等一下。
- 是啊，这下可以解释了。

841
00:37:54,067 --> 00:37:58,732
So we're in the box.
We're the cat.
所以我们就处在盒子里。
我们就是那猫。

842
00:37:58,733 --> 00:38:01,533
We're both alive and dead.
我们既活着又死了。

843
00:38:01,534 --> 00:38:06,566
So, there are... There are two
separate realities, and...
所以，存在…存在
两个分离的现实……

844
00:38:06,567 --> 00:38:09,532
presumably until the comet passes.
大概直到彗星经过。

845
00:38:09,533 --> 00:38:11,666
- Until the comet passes?
- Okay.
- 直到彗星经过？
- 好吧。

846
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:15,566
Or decoherence is maintained and
those two separate realities...
或者退相干一直持续着，
这两个分离的现实…

847
00:38:15,567 --> 00:38:17,533
will remain separate once the comet passes.
…在彗星经过时将保持分离。

848
00:38:17,534 --> 00:38:19,033
Everybody will be fine.
大家将平安无事。

849
00:38:19,034 --> 00:38:21,033
Decoherence keeps us separate.
退相干使我们保持分离。

850
00:38:21,034 --> 00:38:22,200
Right.
是的。

851
00:38:22,201 --> 00:38:26,466
Why are the other us contacting
us then in this way?
那为什么另外的我们
要以这种方式和我们接触？

852
00:38:26,467 --> 00:38:27,999
They didn't want to.
他们没想接触。

853
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,499
Who got the pictures?
Who... The numbers?
谁弄的这些照片？
谁…还有这些数字？

854
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,900
We started it when we went
to find a house with lights.
是我们开的头，因为我们
去找那所亮着灯的房子。

855
00:38:33,901 --> 00:38:36,433
Yeah, maybe they didn't
mean the box for us.
是啊，也许这盒子
不是留给我们的。

856
00:38:36,434 --> 00:38:38,999
The box isn't for us.
这盒子不是给我们的。

857
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,866
What if we've already
interacted with ourselves?
要是我们已经和我们自己
有过相互作用了会怎么样？

858
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:45,599
So, we're collapsing
on ourselves right now.
那么我们现在就会
坍缩到我们自己身上了。

859
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,331
Not if we stay separate
from each other.
但如果我们还是保持
彼此分离的话就不会。

860
00:38:48,332 --> 00:38:50,632
It's already too late.
We've already been there.
现在已经太晚了，
我们已经去过那里。

861
00:38:50,633 --> 00:38:54,066
Do you remember that movie
Sliding Doors?
你们还记得那部电影吗，《滑动门》？
【又译作《双面情人》（1998）】

862
00:38:54,067 --> 00:38:56,966
Where just a fraction of a second...
里面讲在几分之一秒之内，

863
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:59,030
there could be two realities?
就可以有两个现实？

864
00:38:59,031 --> 00:39:01,998
In one, she runs and tries to get
on the subway and she can't.
其中一个，她跑着想上
那班地铁，但没上去。

865
00:39:01,999 --> 00:39:03,733
She gets her hand stuck in the door.
她把手卡在车门上。

866
00:39:03,734 --> 00:39:05,397
In the other one, she gets
through and there's two...
在另一个中，她上了车，
所以存在两个分叉的现实……

867
00:39:05,398 --> 00:39:07,865
If we're collapsing right now,
I'm gonna collapse on them.
如果我们现在就坍缩，
我希望坍缩到他们身上。

868
00:39:07,866 --> 00:39:10,087
I'm not gonna wait for
them to collapse on us.
我可不愿意等他们过来
坍缩到我们身上。

869
00:39:10,088 --> 00:39:11,865
Whoa, whoa, Mike.
喔哦，喔哦，<u>迈克</u>。

870
00:39:11,866 --> 00:39:13,930
I'll go over there
and I'll just kill 'em.
我要到那边去，
我要去杀了他们。

871
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:16,264
- What?
- Half-kidding.
- 什么？
- 我没太开玩笑。

872
00:39:16,265 --> 00:39:17,931
- Mike, let's just...
- I love my fucking life.
- <u>迈克</u>，让我们……
- 我喜欢我他妈的生活。

873
00:39:17,932 --> 00:39:20,564
Let's be smart first
before we do anything stupid,
在做出任何蠢事之前
让我们先变得聪明一点，

874
00:39:20,565 --> 00:39:22,065
and let's stick with that we do know.
让我们坚持我们确切了解的事。

875
00:39:22,066 --> 00:39:24,964
And what's smart? Just sitting here?
Doing nothing?
什么是聪明？就坐在这儿？
什么都不做？

876
00:39:24,965 --> 00:39:27,266
What we do know is that
we took this box. Right?
我们确切了解的是
我们拿了这盒子，对吗？

877
00:39:27,267 --> 00:39:29,363
So, our first act should
be to return it. Yes?
所以我们首先要做的
应该是将它归还，对吗？

878
00:39:29,364 --> 00:39:31,031
Fuck that. No. We're not
returning that box.
去它的吧！不，我们
才不归还那盒子呢。

879
00:39:31,032 --> 00:39:33,165
I don't trust that house.
That stays here.
我不相信那所房子，
盒子必须留下。

880
00:39:33,166 --> 00:39:35,964
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What's got you so freaked out?
- 等等，等等。
- 什么让你那么害怕？

881
00:39:35,965 --> 00:39:38,597
- Stupid, stupid question.
- You're right.
- 愚蠢，愚蠢的问题。
- 是啊，没错。

882
00:39:38,598 --> 00:39:41,031
We're not at war with the
house down the street.
我们没和街那头的
那所房子开战。

883
00:39:41,032 --> 00:39:44,263
They might literally
be the same people as us.
他们可能是和我们
完全一模一样的人。

884
00:39:44,264 --> 00:39:46,602
Mike's saying come over
here and let's kill us.
<u>迈克</u>说要到这儿来
杀掉我们自己，去他妈的！

885
00:39:46,603 --> 00:39:51,163
That's right. If you do it first,
you know who you're gonna fight?
没错，如果你先下手，
你知道你会和谁打吗？

886
00:39:51,164 --> 00:39:52,763
- Mike.
- You.
- <u>迈克</u>。
- 你。

887
00:39:52,764 --> 00:39:54,766
You're gonna run into you.
你会撞见你自己。

888
00:39:56,265 --> 00:39:57,769
Who's gonna win that?
谁会赢呢？

889
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:01,432
Who did you see in the window
when you went there?
你去那里时在窗子里看见谁了？

890
00:40:01,433 --> 00:40:03,430

- 你看见你自己了吗？

- I told you who I saw.
- Okay, okay.
- 我告诉过你我看见谁了。
- 好吧，好吧。

892
00:40:04,997 --> 00:40:09,663
But what if, in that over there,
that house, what if I'm drinking?
但要是在那边，在那所房子里
我在烂饮会怎么样？

893
00:40:09,664 --> 00:40:12,015
I mean, just think about that for a sec.
我是说可以考虑这种可能性吧。

894
00:40:14,498 --> 00:40:16,529
That's a fucked-up Michael.
那个<u>迈克</u>就是个废物。

895
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:18,730
Oh, God.
噢，天哪。

896
00:40:18,731 --> 00:40:20,529
I'm not gonna wait
for a fucking drunk Mike...
我可不愿等他妈的
一个醉醺醺的<u>迈克</u>…

897
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:22,028
to come over here and kill me.
…过来把我杀了。

898
00:40:22,029 --> 00:40:24,767
And kill you and kill you and kill you.
然后杀了你、杀了你、杀了你。

899
00:40:27,764 --> 00:40:29,564
I'm not waiting for that.
我不会等到那一步。

900
00:40:30,563 --> 00:40:32,597
Wait, wait, wait a minute.
等等，等等，等一下。

901
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:34,929
Who did you see when you were there?
你在那儿都看见谁了？

902
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:40,463
I saw Amir, I saw Hugh, and I saw Lee.
我看见<u>阿米尔</u>，我看见<u>休</u>，还看见<u>李</u>。

903
00:40:40,464 --> 00:40:42,329
Okay. Lee's not here right now.
好吧，<u>李</u>现在不在这里。

904
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:44,596
- She's taking a nap.
- What do you mean, she's taking a nap?
- 她在小睡。
- 什么意思，她在小睡？

905
00:40:44,597 --> 00:40:47,528
- So, it's different, then.
- Something's off. It's not the same.
- 所以说有不一样。
- 有对不上的，不完全一模一样。

906
00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:49,029
In this reality, Lee's napping.
在这个现实，<u>李</u>在小睡；

907
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,828
Maybe in that reality, you're napping?
也许在那个现实，你在小睡？

908
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:53,328
So, that's why Mike didn't see her.
所以<u>迈克</u>才没看见她。

909
00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:56,864
Right, and if Beth is
napping in that reality...
是的，如果在那个现实里

00:40:57,863 --> 00:40:59,496
they don't have the book.

911
00:40:59,497 --> 00:41:01,029
- They don't.
- Right.

The other house doesn't have the book.
那所房子里没有这本书。

913
00:41:02,797 --> 00:41:04,561
And if they don't have the book,
如果他们没有这本书，

914
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:08,127
they're not having this
conversation right now.
那么他们也不会有
现在我们这样的对话。

915
00:41:08,128 --> 00:41:10,762
So, then if we get
the book from the car...
所以如果我们从

916
00:41:10,763 --> 00:41:13,162
then we can avoid all this.

917
00:41:13,163 --> 00:41:14,595
Take it? Take their book?

918
00:41:14,596 --> 00:41:16,131
It's a possibility.

919
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:20,328
- Hugh, give me your keys.
- No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
- <u>休</u>，把你车钥匙给我。
- 不，不，不。等等，等等。

920
00:41:20,329 --> 00:41:22,834
We're not supposed to mess with any of this.
我们不应该瞎搅合这样的事。

921
00:41:23,034 --> 00:41:24,628
Why would we even risk this?
为什么我们要冒这样的风险？

922

- He's talking about going over and fighting them.

- 他一直在说要过去和他们开战。
- 为什么把情况变得更糟？

923
00:41:27,328 --> 00:41:29,427
Because then I don't have to
go over there and kill them.
因为这样我就不必
去到那里把他们杀了。

924
00:41:29,428 --> 00:41:30,962
Just give me the keys.
快把钥匙给我。

925

927
00:41:43,296 --> 00:41:45,530
Where you going, Mike?

928
00:41:46,197 --> 00:41:48,017
How do we know it's exactly us?
我们怎么知道那就是我们？

929
00:41:48,027 --> 00:41:51,294
What if it's just externals? What if...

930
00:41:51,295 --> 00:41:52,961
- The dark side of us.
- Yeah.
- 我们黑暗的一面。
- 是啊。

931
00:41:52,962 --> 00:41:56,394

- You mean, the not friendly versions?
- 那是我们，各位。
- 你是说，我们的非友善版本？

could be... Is it a good thing?
好吧，如果那是我们，

It sounds like it would be a way to reach...
听上去像是有了条达到更高…

934
00:42:02,861 --> 00:42:06,394
- higher consciousness, if we want to...
- Like an acceptance of ourselves?
- …意识层面的途径，如果我们想……
- 譬如接受我们自己？

935
00:42:06,395 --> 00:42:09,460
Well, yeah. We always talk about meeting
ourselves and finding ourselves,
噢，是啊，我们总是谈论
面对自己和发现自己，

936
00:42:09,461 --> 00:42:10,927
and here we have an opportunity...
现在我们有了一个切切实实地…

937
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:13,527
to actually physically find ourselves.

938
00:42:13,528 --> 00:42:15,060
That's a lot of pressure.

939
00:42:15,061 --> 00:42:17,827
- Look who's joined us.
- Hi, everybody.

car to get that book.

I thought you and Hugh
worked that out years ago.
我还以为你和<u>休</u>之间
几年前就解决了呢。

This is the worst idea I've ever heard.
这是我听过的最糟糕的主意。

958

It's amazing,
'cause it would work on me.
那样很奇妙，
因为那会逼我就范。

959

- Going over there...
- It's the same person.
- 到那儿去……

Why would he even say that?

Divergence. Otherwise,
it's just the same people.

968
00:43:13,193 --> 00:43:14,425
And if it's the same people,

969
00:43:14,426 --> 00:43:16,427
then why not just leave each other alone?
那为什么不彼此井水不犯河水呢？

970
00:43:16,428 --> 00:43:18,593
That's what I would want me to do.
那也正是我要求我自己做到的。

971
00:43:18,594 --> 00:43:20,191
That might be the best thing to do.
那也许是最该做的事。

972
00:43:20,192 --> 00:43:21,991
- Right?
- You doing okay?

973
00:43:21,992 --> 00:43:23,425
Yeah, yeah.
还好，还好。

974
00:43:23,426 --> 00:43:27,625
I don't know if I'm woozy from
the drops or if it's like...
我不知道是因为药滴
导致我晕乎乎的还是因为……

975
00:43:27,626 --> 00:43:29,459
- What drops?
- What drops?
- 什么药滴？
- 什么药滴？

976
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,758

Yeah, well.
She wanted to take...
是的，可…
她想要尝…是我。

I just felt so weird before.

passion flower and a little ketamine.
就是些松果菊、金印草、

I swear to God.

- 一点开他敏？

983
00:43:50,259 --> 00:43:52,824
- It's not like you're going to go into this...
- Beth.
- 那东西不太可能把你变得……
- <u>贝思</u>。

00:43:52,825 --> 00:43:56,724
- What?
- I'm so sorry if I'm wrong here...
- 什么？

incredibly inappropriate.

- 是啊，这样好多事就解释通了。

Oh, come on, Amir.

I had to ask.

She asked to take some
and I gave her some.

所以我给她了点。

993
00:44:16,225 --> 00:44:18,924
When we did the mushrooms years ago,
几年前我们吃迷幻蘑菇，

994
00:44:18,925 --> 00:44:23,356
we talked about it, and I put
them in the spaghetti sauce.
是事先说好后，我才把它们

That was a group decision.

I know we agreed,
but I had to ask because...
我知道我们都同意了，
但是我不得不问，因为……

You think that I would just
put drugs in your food?

Oh, my God.

Okay. I'll show you.
好吧，我给你看。

This is the vial I brought.

Yeah, and a quarter of it is gone.

But that's... She's had
a couple of drops out of it.
但那…她从瓶里取了好几滴。

1005
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:47,556
- That's it.
- This is, like, high-grade pharmaceutical...
- 就这样。
- 这应该是高级别的配方药吧…

1006
00:44:47,557 --> 00:44:49,623
- It is watered down.
- You can't.
- 兑过水的。
- 你不能。

1007
00:44:49,624 --> 00:44:51,089
You opened it up and watered it down?
你打开瓶子兑的水？

1008
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:52,742
Okay, but if you took enough of it,
好吧，但如果你用得足够多，

1009
00:44:52,753 --> 00:44:54,556
isn't it true that you
would have hallucinations?
还是会产生幻觉，
这是事实吧？

1010
00:44:54,557 --> 00:44:56,056
You would have to have a massive dose.
那你得用很大剂量才行，

1011
00:44:56,057 --> 00:44:57,890
You would have to take the entire bottle.

Okay. Fine. But is it true?

1013
00:45:01,025 --> 00:45:03,057
- Yes. 
- Okay. And is it also true...
- 是的……
- 好的。另外它还会…

1014
00:45:03,058 --> 00:45:05,589
that one of the other
effects can be paranoia?
…使人疑神疑鬼，
这也是事实之一？

1015
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:08,023
Yes, but you...
是的，但是你…

1016
00:45:08,024 --> 00:45:10,188
- Again, you would have to have all of it.
- The whole bottle.
- 再说一遍，你得全部用掉。
- 整个一瓶。

1017
00:45:10,189 --> 00:45:11,708
- The whole bottle.
- And it would never...
- 整个一瓶。
- 那绝不可能……

1018
00:45:11,857 --> 00:45:15,123
Even if all of us took a bottle each,
即使我们每个人都各喝掉一瓶，

1019
00:45:15,124 --> 00:45:17,455
it would never create a mass hallucination.
也绝不可能产生集体幻觉。

1020
00:45:17,456 --> 00:45:21,321
- I'm not a criminal.
- It would be a nice conclusion right now.
- 我不是罪犯！
- 那样的结论比较容易接受。

1021
00:45:21,322 --> 00:45:23,422
Wouldn't this be great
if we were hallucinating?
说我们产生了幻觉，
这样不是很安心吗？

1022
00:45:23,423 --> 00:45:25,888
- Well, it's not the explanation.
- Fine.
- 但不是这样解释的。
- 好吧。

1023
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:29,589
- I believe you.  - I asked for it.
- This is the bottle.
- 我相信你。　- 是我要喝的。
- 就是这瓶子。

1024
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:31,822

- Okay.
- 她问我要，我给了她一点。

1025
00:45:31,823 --> 00:45:33,856
I-I did not drug your food.
我…我没有给你们的食物下毒。

1026
00:45:33,857 --> 00:45:35,921

1028
00:45:38,622 --> 00:45:40,822
I swear to God.

That thrift store.

00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:00,091
Okay.

I just want to wake up
and start again, you know?
要是能醒过来重新
来一遍就好了，你知道？

What are we gonna do?

1098
00:49:03,885 --> 00:49:06,116
- No. You're not leaving.
- Baby, relax. What?
- 不，你不能离开！
- 宝贝，放松点。怎么？

1099
00:49:06,117 --> 00:49:07,550
- No.
- It's fine. I'll be back.
- 不行！
- 没事的，我会回来的。

1100
00:49:07,551 --> 00:49:10,653
I'm not gonna let you go.
我不会放你走！

1101
00:49:12,252 --> 00:49:14,758
It would be fucking crazy.
这太他妈的扯了！

1102
00:49:20,752 --> 00:49:22,329
Okay. So, what are we gonna do?
好吧，那我们该怎么办？

1103
00:49:22,529 --> 00:49:25,884
I mean, they're out there, and I swear
to God, I'm gonna have a heart attack.
我是说，他们俩还在外面，
天哪，我都要发心脏病了。

1104
00:49:25,885 --> 00:49:27,717
- We've gotta do something.
- Let's have a drink.
- 我们得做点什么吧。
- 我们来喝一杯吧。

1105
00:49:27,718 --> 00:49:29,483
We don't even know if that was them.
我们甚至不知道那就是他们。

1106
00:49:29,484 --> 00:49:31,516
Would you quit saying that, please?
能不能求你别怎么说了？

1107
00:49:31,517 --> 00:49:33,450
No, but if it wasn't them,
then Mike is right,
可如果那不是他们，
那<u>迈克</u>是对的，

1108
00:49:33,451 --> 00:49:35,082
and we can't trust the other house.
我们不能相信另外那所房子。

1109
00:49:35,083 --> 00:49:36,684
- We can't trust ourselves.
- That's right.
- 我们不能相信我们自己。
- 没错。

1110
00:49:36,685 --> 00:49:40,288
- Jesus.
- And our clues just left the house.
- 天哪。
- 我们的线索已经不在这房子里了。

1111
00:49:43,285 --> 00:49:46,183
No. Wait.
不，等等。

1112
00:49:46,284 --> 00:49:49,915
The clues are still here.
线索仍在这房子里。

1113
00:49:49,916 --> 00:49:52,417
If they had the pictures, then...
如果他们有了那些照片，那么……

1114
00:49:52,418 --> 00:49:54,950
Mike, you took that picture
of me and Kevin. Right?
<u>迈克</u>，我和<u>凯文</u>的那张合影
是你给我们照的，对吗？

1115
00:49:54,951 --> 00:49:57,716
Do you have it here?
你这儿有吗？

1116
00:49:57,817 --> 00:50:00,849
I-I can't take this anymore.
I can't take it.
我…我受不了这个。
我再也受不了了。

1117
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:04,325
- Sweetheart...
- Can you at least go look for it?
- 亲爱的……
- 你能不能去帮我找找看？

1118
00:50:05,817 --> 00:50:08,366
I'm gonna look for another bottle of wine.
我要去找找另一瓶酒看。

1119
00:50:25,349 --> 00:50:27,418
This is so stupid.
这太可笑了。

1120
00:50:28,313 --> 00:50:30,048
Should I be keeping an eye on him?
我要不要注意着点儿他？

1121
00:50:30,049 --> 00:50:33,248
I feel like I don't want to hover, and...
我觉得我不想犹犹疑疑，可……

1122

I don't know.
我不知道。

1123
00:50:38,316 --> 00:50:40,384
Just give it a minute, and then...
先考虑一下，然后…

1124
00:50:42,382 --> 00:50:44,312
go in and talk to him, I guess.
进去和他谈谈，我想。

1125
00:50:46,782 --> 00:50:50,315
I don't know who Mike is anymore.
Not when he drinks.
我不再认识<u>迈克</u>，
在他喝醉的时候。

1126
00:50:50,316 --> 00:50:53,015
Everything that's gone wrong with us
started when he started drinking.
他开始酗酒之后，
我们的一切都出了差错。

1127
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:54,382
It's why we had to leave L.A.
这就是我们不得不
离开<u>洛杉矶</u>的原因，

1128
00:50:54,383 --> 00:50:56,482
It's why he doesn't have a career.
这也是他事业不顺的原因。

1129

He's just... I don't know.

1130

Not the man I married.

1131

Hey.
嘿。

00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,780
- Hey.
- How you doing?

All things considered, all right.

I totally don't believe you.

- 是啊，唔，我是不是现在……

gonna go to Vietnam...
我…<u>阿米尔</u>跟我说

I gotta go for work for, I don't know...
我要去那儿工作，我不知道…

1141
00:52:23,413 --> 00:52:25,647
It's four months, I think, and,
是四个月，我想，

1142
00:52:25,648 --> 00:52:27,680
yeah, I want her to come along, but...

She'd be crazy not to go with you.

I mean, it's... I-I really
don't want to interfere.
我是说，这……我…我真的
不是想多管闲事，

1147
00:52:35,214 --> 00:52:36,878
It doesn't seem like any of my business,
这事看起来与我一点关系没有，

1148
00:52:36,879 --> 00:52:39,545
but I think you've always been someone...
但是我觉得你一直是那种…

1149
00:52:39,546 --> 00:52:42,979
who's extremely passionate about
your life and what you're doing,
…对你的生活和你所
从事的事业极端热情的人，

1150
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:45,912
and if you have a partner that
seems to hesitate all the time,
如果你有一个伴侣，
她似乎总是犹犹豫豫的，

1151
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:50,180
with things of life, I don't know
if that's gonna make you happy.
对生活的方方面面，
我不知道那是否能让你幸福。

1152
00:52:50,181 --> 00:52:52,645
Oh. She's...
噢，她……

1153

- Tall?

- 瞎说。
- 她个儿有点儿高。

1156
00:53:03,044 --> 00:53:05,352
I mean, do you have to stand
on your tiptoes to kiss her?
我是说，你是不是得

1157
00:53:05,379 --> 00:53:07,377
I...
我……

1158
00:53:11,279 --> 00:53:13,511
Sometimes people just fit well.

Come on, you can't tell me
we don't fit well.
拜托，别跟我说我们不匹配。

I had to do yoga for a week
afterwards to recover.

Laurie.

1171
00:54:09,078 --> 00:54:11,245
For you or for me?

1172
00:54:11,345 --> 00:54:12,747
Could be either.
都可以。

1173
00:54:15,744 --> 00:54:18,142
What are we doing here?
我们在这儿干嘛？

1174
00:54:18,143 --> 00:54:23,645
If I'm losing it over there,
I'm losing it here.
如果我在那边失去了理智，
那么在这边我也失去了。

1175
00:54:24,223 --> 00:54:26,843
- It doesn't have to be like that.
- Sure, it does.

00:54:26,844 --> 00:54:28,710
It's the same thing.
这是一回事。

1177
00:54:28,711 --> 00:54:30,910

How do you figure?
你怎么知道？

loves you as much as I love you right here.

Is there something going on?

1187
00:55:19,043 --> 00:55:23,242
Beth just walked up to me and...

她当然没说太多，

saw you and Laurie talk
in the hallway, and...
…看见你和<u>劳瑞</u>
在过道里谈话……

than what Beth is saying.
…更重要的事要担心。

1193
00:55:42,942 --> 00:55:44,273
Jesus Christ.
老天哪！

1194
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:46,608
- Are you kidding me?
- That would be the generator.
- 不会吧？
- 一定是发电机坏了。

Like one of our cars getting broken into.
像我们的一辆车被砸窗了。

Look, I'm going out there.

听着，我要出去看看，
我不会容忍这个。

Yeah, why doesn't everybody
check their own car.
是啊，每个人最好
检查一下自己的车，

1219
00:56:47,241 --> 00:56:49,374
- See if we find anything else.
- Let's look at our cars.
- 看看是否能发现点什么。
- 我们去看我们的车。

1220
00:56:49,375 --> 00:56:51,671
- Okay.
- All right. After you.
- 好吧。
- 好吧，你先请。

1221
00:56:51,972 --> 00:56:54,607
Is everyone nearby?
大家靠的很近吗？

1222
00:56:55,008 --> 00:56:58,014
We shouldn't spread out too much.
我们不应该分得太开。

1223
00:57:15,739 --> 00:57:18,204
- Hey.
- Everything okay?
- 嘿。
- 一切都好吗？

1224
00:57:18,405 --> 00:57:21,572
Yeah. I just...
是的，我想…

1225
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:26,605
put this ring on that
you got me at the fair.
…把你在集市上给我买的
那枚戒指戴上。

1226
00:57:26,705 --> 00:57:28,673
Remember? I know it's...
记得吗？我知道它……

1227
00:57:29,073 --> 00:57:31,906
I know it's cheesy,
but I just wanted to have it on.
我知道它很俗气，
但我就是想戴上它。

1228
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:33,771
Cheeseball.
巨土。

1229
00:57:33,972 --> 00:57:38,238
- It was a good day.
- It was a good day.
- 那天很开心。
- 那天是很开心。

1230
00:57:38,239 --> 00:57:40,605
Are we okay?
你还好吗？

1231
00:57:40,606 --> 00:57:44,572
- Yeah, babe.
- After that whole Laurie thing?
- 好的，宝贝。 
- 在<u>劳瑞</u>搅合了之后？

1232
00:57:44,573 --> 00:57:46,738
Yeah.
呃…是啊。

1233
00:57:46,739 --> 00:57:48,539
I don't know what the hell she's thinking,
我不知道她究竟怎么想的，

1234
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:51,572
but yeah, we're good.
但是的，我们很好。

1235
00:57:51,573 --> 00:57:54,445
Come here. Hey.
到这边来。嘿。

1236
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,971
Is everything okay with Hugh's car?
<u>休</u>的车没大碍吧？

1237
00:58:01,972 --> 00:58:06,837
- What do you mean?
- Well, did they take anything?
- 你什么意思？
- 他们拿走什么东西了吗？

1238
00:58:06,838 --> 00:58:10,224
You just checked on his car.
Did they take anything?
你刚才看了他的车，
他们有没有拿走东西？

1239
00:58:38,705 --> 00:58:40,870
Doesn't make any sense at all.
完全没有道理。

1240
00:58:40,871 --> 00:58:43,403
Do you think it's just someone
trying to intimidate us?
你认为这只是
有人想吓唬我们吗？

1241
00:58:43,404 --> 00:58:44,936
Intimidate? No. I... It's...
吓唬？不。我…这……

1242
00:58:44,937 --> 00:58:47,269
None of this... It doesn't...
所有这些…都不……

1243
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:50,503
I mean, it's like they're
looking for something, and...
我是说，看起来好像
他们在找什么东西……

1244
00:58:50,504 --> 00:58:53,737
- But there's nothing in there.
- Exactly. There's nothing in there. So, why...
- 但那里面什么都没有。
- 没错，什么都没有，所以为什么……

1245
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:55,203
They could see that there's nothing in there.
他们可以看见里面没有东西。

1246
00:58:55,204 --> 00:58:57,170
- We could see that there's nothing in there.
- I know.
- 我们可以看见里面没有东西。
- 我知道。

1247
00:58:57,171 --> 00:58:59,770
Why break the window
if there's nothing there?
如果里面没有东西，
为什么要砸破车窗？

1248
00:58:59,771 --> 00:59:03,171
- That doesn't make any sense.
- None of this makes any sense.
- 那太没道理了。
- 这一切都没道理。

1249
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:04,702
Where were you?
你去哪儿了？

1250
00:59:04,703 --> 00:59:08,137
I went and got this ring.
我去取这枚戒指。

1251
00:59:08,238 --> 00:59:11,339
Nice.
不错。

1252
00:59:12,301 --> 00:59:14,037
All right, hold on.
Let's-Let's...
好吧，等一下。
让我们…让我们……

1253
00:59:14,038 --> 00:59:17,035
Let's just try and figure out...
让我们试着搞清楚…

1254
00:59:17,036 --> 00:59:23,002
why we would break into
a car... Hugh's car...
…为什么我们要
砸破一辆车…<u>休</u>的车…

1255
00:59:23,003 --> 00:59:25,270
knowing that the book wasn't there.
明明知道书不在那里。

1256
00:59:25,271 --> 00:59:27,235
Well, we're assuming
that the book is the motive.
我们一直假设书是动机，

1257
00:59:27,236 --> 00:59:30,136
What if the motive is completely different?
但如果动机完全不同呢？

1258
00:59:30,137 --> 00:59:32,069
- Did you hear something?
- What the hell is that?
- 你们听到什么吗？
- 那是什么？

1259
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:33,835
It's outside. No, Mike,
Mike, Mike, Mike.
在外面。不，<u>迈克</u>，
<u>迈克</u>，<u>迈克</u>，<u>迈克</u>！

1260
00:59:33,836 --> 00:59:37,403
- Oh, shit! There's someone coming.
- What?
- 噢，见鬼！有人过来了！
- 什么？

1261
00:59:37,404 --> 00:59:39,437
They're coming over here, guys.
他们到这里来了，各位。

1262
00:59:39,438 --> 00:59:41,335
Yeah. It's Hugh.
是啊，那是<u>休</u>。

1263
00:59:41,336 --> 00:59:43,136
- Is it Hugh?
- Is it Hugh and Amir?
- 是<u>休</u>吗？
- 是<u>休</u>和<u>阿米尔</u>？

1264
00:59:43,137 --> 00:59:46,067
Yeah, it's blue.
It's Hugh and Amir. Cool.
是的，蓝色的，
是<u>休</u>和<u>阿米尔</u>，别怕。

1265
00:59:46,087 --> 00:59:48,369
- They're coming to the door.
- Are you sure?
- 他们朝门走过来。
- 你确定吗？

1266
00:59:48,370 --> 00:59:51,601
- It looks like it.
- Oh, baby.
- 应该是的。
- 噢，宝贝。

1267
00:59:51,602 --> 00:59:53,335
Are you all okay?
你们都还好吗？

1268
00:59:53,336 --> 00:59:56,369
- Hey, where have you been? What happened?
- Okay.
- 嘿，你们去哪儿了？发生什么事了？
- 好了。

1269
00:59:56,370 --> 01:00:00,334
What have you been... Why did
you take... What did you do?
你们都干…为什么你拿……
你干什么去了？

1270
01:00:00,335 --> 01:00:03,068
- Can you please tell us what happened?
- We went to...
- 能不能告诉我们发生什么事了？
- 我们去…

1271
01:00:03,069 --> 01:00:06,034
We went to make a phone call,
and then when...
我们想去打个电话，然后当…

1272
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:08,001
when we looked in the door, we saw...
当我们往门里看时，我们见到…

1273
01:00:08,002 --> 01:00:12,234
We saw this, basically.
I, I got startled.
我们见到了这些，大致一样。
我，呃…我吓了一跳，

1274
01:00:12,235 --> 01:00:14,701
I fell over. I hit my head.
We went back to the house to...
摔倒了，碰破了头。
我们回到这所房子……

1275
01:00:14,901 --> 01:00:17,001
Wait. You already came back here.
等等，你们已经回来过这里。

1276
01:00:17,002 --> 01:00:18,802
We already heard this story.
我们已经听过这故事。

1277
01:00:18,803 --> 01:00:20,635
Why are you telling us
this story again?
为什么你又给我们
讲一遍这个故事？

1278
01:00:20,636 --> 01:00:22,235
- You came back with the box.
- Wait. What?
- 先前你们带回了一个盒子。
- 等等，什么？

1279
01:00:22,236 --> 01:00:24,335
Because you came back,
and after you hit your head...
因为你们回来过， 
你弄破了你的头…

1280
01:00:24,336 --> 01:00:27,487
We gave him a Band-Aid
and you gave us the...
我们给他贴了“邦迪”，
你给了我们那个……

1281
01:00:27,687 --> 01:00:29,334
But not that Band-Aid.
但不是这块“邦迪”。

1282
01:00:29,335 --> 01:00:33,101
- What do you mean?
- Oh, my God. I gave you a cloth Band-Aid.
- 你什么意思？
- 噢，天哪！我给你贴的是布条“邦迪”。

1283
01:00:33,102 --> 01:00:36,467
Wait a minute. Hugh...
There was a Hugh and an Amir here?
等一下，<u>休</u>……
这里有过一个<u>休</u>和一个<u>阿米尔</u>？

1284
01:00:36,468 --> 01:00:38,334
Yes. And you left with the book.
是的，而且你们把书带走了，

1285
01:00:38,335 --> 01:00:41,099
You left with the pictures,
and we didn't know where you went.
你们还带走了照片，
我们不知道你们去哪儿了。

1286
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:43,934
We were at a house where
everybody had red glowsticks.
我们去的那所房子里
人人都有红荧光棒。

1287
01:00:43,935 --> 01:00:46,334
- You had red glowsticks.
- Do you understand?
- 你们有红荧光棒。
- 你们懂吗？

1288
01:00:46,435 --> 01:00:50,233
We... We have red glow...
We took them from the other house.
我们…我们有红荧光…
我们从那所房子拿的。

1289
01:00:50,234 --> 01:00:52,333
- Right.
- Look. Look.
- 是的。
- 你们看，你们看。

1290
01:00:52,334 --> 01:00:55,749
Is that... Look. That box of
red glowsticks is unopened.
这不是…看，那盒红荧光棒
压根就没开封过。

1291
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:58,699
Guys, if they started here,
they belong here.
各位，如果他们开始在这里，
那么他们就属于这里。

1292
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:00,934
They're in the right house.
他们来对了房子。

1293
01:01:00,935 --> 01:01:03,767
- Well, welcome back.
- Welcome back.
- 是啊，欢迎回来。
- 欢迎回来。

1294
01:01:03,768 --> 01:01:06,100
- Jeez, man, I'm sorry.
- That's all right.
- 天哪，对不起了。
- 没关系。

1295
01:01:06,101 --> 01:01:08,033
Sorry.
对不起。

1296
01:01:08,034 --> 01:01:12,667
So, guys, what was the other Mike like?
What was he doing?
那么，另一个<u>迈克</u>怎么样？
他在干嘛？

1297
01:01:12,668 --> 01:01:16,668
The other Mike is...
He's worried about you.
另一个<u>迈克</u>……
他在为你烦恼。

1298
01:01:17,996 --> 01:01:20,100
So, it was you guys who left us the note.
那么是你们俩给我们留的条。

1299
01:01:20,101 --> 01:01:23,734
No, I never got out with that note.
不，我没能送出那便条。

1300
01:01:23,735 --> 01:01:25,665
We ended up with two notes.
我们最后有了两张便条。

1301
01:01:25,666 --> 01:01:27,389
And so did we.
我们也一样。

1302
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,713
- Well, where's...
- We have two notes.
- 那哪里……
- 我们有两张便条。

1303
01:01:29,714 --> 01:01:33,331
One that was written here
and one that was left on the door.
一张是在这儿写的，
一张是留在门上的。

1304
01:01:33,741 --> 01:01:37,100
If you didn't, and if
the other Hugh didn't,
如果你们没留，如果
其他的<u>休</u>也没留，

1305
01:01:37,101 --> 01:01:40,228
then who has been leaving the notes?
那这些便条是谁留下的？

1306
01:01:40,299 --> 01:01:43,599
"Quantum decoherence ensures
that the different outcomes...
“量子退相干保证了
这些不同的结果…

1307
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,932
have no interaction with one another."
“…不会再有任何的相互作用。”

1308
01:01:45,933 --> 01:01:48,532
So, that one note has been
written at least four times.
所以那张便条至少
已经被写过四遍了。

1309
01:01:48,533 --> 01:01:52,083
Well, how many Hugh and Amirs
are walking around out there?
到底有多少<u>休</u>和
<u>阿米尔</u>在那儿晃荡？

1310
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,933
Okay, before we do anything,
好吧，在做任何事之前，

1311
01:01:55,934 --> 01:01:58,966
we have to figure out
how to mark our own house.
我们必须想出如何标记
我们自己房子的办法。

1312
01:01:58,967 --> 01:02:01,499
- Just stay inside.
- No, no. She's right.
- 就呆在房子里。
- 不，不，她说得对。

1313
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,999
Staying inside isn't realistic.
光呆在房子里不实际。

1314
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,999
We need some kind of marker.
We got to mark this house.
我们需要某种记号，
我们要给这房子做记号。

1315
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,599
If every house is the same...
如果每所房子都一样…

1316
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,833
If we put a marker
in front of the house,
那如果我们在房子前面
做上标记的话，

1317
01:02:10,834 --> 01:02:12,864
there could be an infinite
number of houses with that mark.
就可能会有无穷多房子
有同样的标记。

1318
01:02:12,865 --> 01:02:14,698
So, we have to do something random.
所以我们得做出随机的事情，

1319
01:02:14,699 --> 01:02:16,165
Something that can't be repeated.
Something unique.
不能被重复的事情，
独一无二的事情。

1320
01:02:16,166 --> 01:02:18,631
- Dice. Do we have dice?
- We have dice?
- 骰子，我们有骰子吗？
- 我们有骰子吗？

1321
01:02:18,632 --> 01:02:22,533
- Um, Yahtzee.
- Yeah, Yahtzee.
- 唔，“快艇”游戏。
- 是啊，“快艇”游戏里有。

1322
01:02:22,534 --> 01:02:26,631
If we each roll a number for each
of us, that's what? That's...
如果我们每个人都给自己
掷个数，那有多少？那有……

1323
01:02:26,632 --> 01:02:29,631
Six times six times six times six
times... That's hugely random.
6乘以6乘以6乘以6乘以……
那就相当随机了。

1324
01:02:29,632 --> 01:02:33,432
- The probability of that repeating is... tiny.
- And then what? We...
- 重复的几率就…微乎其微。
- 然后呢？我们……

1325
01:02:33,433 --> 01:02:35,932
But so we have to have something visual.
但我们得有看得见的东西，

1326
01:02:35,933 --> 01:02:37,911
I mean, should we write
it down, put it in...
我是说，我们应该写下来吗？
把它放到…

1327
01:02:38,111 --> 01:02:40,064
put it outside? Put it in an envelope?
放到外面？放到信封里？

1328
01:02:40,065 --> 01:02:41,498
- We still won't know.
- No, no, no, no.
- 我们仍然不知道。
- 不，不，不，不。

1329
01:02:41,499 --> 01:02:43,163
We need something to mark it.
我们需要有标记的东西。

1330
01:02:43,164 --> 01:02:45,665
Yeah. We put it in a box.
是的，我们把它放进盒子里。

1331
01:02:46,365 --> 01:02:48,431
- That's, that's...
- That's exactly what they've done.
- 那样…那样……
- 那样正是他们做的。

1332
01:02:48,432 --> 01:02:51,097
- They were ahead of us.
- They were making a marker for their house.
- 他们做在我们前面了。
- 他们在给他们的房子做标记。

1333
01:02:51,098 --> 01:02:53,497
They made a unique mark.
Only we took it.
他们做了唯一的标记，
只是被我们拿来了。

1334
01:02:53,498 --> 01:02:55,464
If it seems like a good idea to us,
如果这在我们看来是个好主意，

1335
01:02:55,465 --> 01:02:56,765
it would seem like a good idea to them.
那在他们看来也会是个好主意。

那太可笑了。

1341

- I'm the attorney for Grizzly Adams.
- Yeah, I know. This is...
- 我是“灰熊”<u>亚当斯</u>的律师。
- 是啊，我知道。这是……
【<u>美国</u>十九世纪的一位著名驯兽师】

I'm never hiring you.

How does this work as a box?

I didn't even know we had it.
我都不知道我们家有这个盒子，

它就在后面的一堆

I'm not too happy about cutting these pictures.

不，我把我的，呃…

the back of this old photo that I have,
我的支票帐户的账号写在了
他的这张旧照的背面，

1355
01:03:47,098 --> 01:03:49,163

It's right here.

Great. I think we got one
of everybody except me, so...
太好了。我想除了我
大家都有照片了，所以……

of pictures of your friend, Amir.
我很高兴你们都保留了不少

It's not exactly the same.

It's not the same as
the one from the other box.
这张和另一个盒子里的那张不一样。

house, but it's not exactly the same.
他们在另一所房子里给我
拍了一张，但不完全一样。

That's a moment where it can be...
这就是我们说起过的，

1369
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:28,262
a different... a divergent moment.
…不同的……一个分叉的时刻。

That's what we're gonna do
right now with these dice.
这就是我们现在
要做的事，用这些骰子。

1371
01:04:30,595 --> 01:04:32,463
Wait. Since we're the blue house,
等一下，既然我们是蓝色房子，

1372
01:04:32,464 --> 01:04:33,995
shouldn't we use a blue pen?

- Just to make it even more...
- That makes sense.
- 可以让这更加……
- 有道理。

1374
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:37,995

- 对吗？

You guys know what a quick code is?
You know when you are going online,
你们知道什么是“快码”吗？

going into your bank account,

it'll give you a picture to choose?

1387
01:05:05,196 --> 01:05:09,195
That's your quick code. That's called an
MFA. It's a multi-factor authenticator.
那就是你的快码，被称为“多因认”，
就是指“多重因素认证”。

1388
01:05:09,196 --> 01:05:11,618
We do 'em. We put 'em in
whenever we build our big sites.
我们做这个。只要我们建大网址，
我们就把它们放进去。

It's an icon, right?
它是一个图符，对吗？

是的。所以如果每个盒子里…

1392
01:05:18,328 --> 01:05:21,961
has a random object in it to sort
of serve as that quick code, right?
…都放有一件随机的物品，
其作用就有点像那快码，对吗？

1393
01:05:21,962 --> 01:05:24,127
Right. Right. So, we pick
something to put in there.
是的，是的。所以我们
挑一件东西放到里面。

01:05:24,128 --> 01:05:27,694
You could put anything in there, right?
A candle or a book or, um...
你可以放任何东西在里面，对吗？
一根蜡烛或一本书或，唔……

01:05:39,594 --> 01:05:41,660
Is anything really random tonight?
今晚有真正随机的东西吗？

1400

If you have to leave,

you're off to a good start.

Yeah, and it only took all
night to figure it out.
是啊，花了一整夜
才想出了这一招。

1406
01:05:52,694 --> 01:05:54,294
We've marked the house.
If we stay together,
我们标记了这房子，
如果我们一直在一起，

1407
01:05:54,295 --> 01:05:58,593
keep our heads up, and nobody
wanders off, we can get through this.
保持警惕，也没人出去乱跑，
那么我们就可以顺利熬过去。

I wonder how different those
numbers are from the first box?

Where's my calculator?
我的计算器在哪儿？

1414
01:06:13,659 --> 01:06:16,855
Let's see. So, if there's eight of us...
你们看啊，如果我们有8个人，

1415
01:06:16,856 --> 01:06:18,760
（绿色：<u>凯文</u>/2、<u>迈克</u>/2、<u>艾米</u>/3、<u>贝思</u>/3

得到5038848个可能的变数。
【5038848=3*6^8】

It's not cracked.
他刚给我看了他的手机，

还记不记得我们走过的

walks through that...
我有种感觉，
无论谁经过那里…

1456
01:08:52,057 --> 01:08:55,688
is like they end up in the
middle of a roulette wheel,
…似乎最后都会落在
一个轮盘赌盘之中，

somewhere by chance.

will not return to the house
that they just left.
…都不可能再回到他们
刚离开的那所房子。

back to our house before the comet passes...
我认为我们需要找出办法回到
彗星经过之前的我们的房子，

1461
01:09:10,723 --> 01:09:13,054
because we... once it...
once it passes,
因为我们……一旦…
一旦它经过了，

we might just be stuck exact... here.
我们就可能被彻底困在了…这里，

I don't want to be stuck here.

If your theory is true...

If we walk through the dark space,

and it is a roulette wheel,

1468
01:09:27,722 --> 01:09:29,855
there's no way we can be sure...
那我们就不可能有可靠的办法…

1469
01:09:29,856 --> 01:09:34,987
that we would go back to our original house.

I think we just stay here.

我把盒子放在外面
靠门的地方了，应该可以了。

we should be okay.
