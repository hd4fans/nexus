2
00:00:57,122 --> 00:01:01,149
Earth, birthplace of the human race,

3
00:01:02,594 --> 00:01:05,427
a species much like our own,

4
00:01:06,298 --> 00:01:08,926
capable of great compassion

5
00:01:10,702 --> 00:01:12,670
and great violence.

6
00:01:23,315 --> 00:01:26,773
For in our quest to protect the humans,

7
00:01:26,885 --> 00:01:29,877
a deeper revelation dawns.

8
00:01:29,988 --> 00:01:33,151
Our worlds have met before.

9
00:02:18,637 --> 00:02:21,936
- Newsflash from the BBC.
- Breaking news out of Shanghai.

10
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,067
There's been a major toxic spill
in the Shanghai factory district.

11
00:02:26,178 --> 00:02:28,271
We're staying
on top of this developing story for you.

12
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,816
We will bring you
any new information as we get it.

13
00:02:36,522 --> 00:02:39,218
NEST Seahawks approaching target.

14
00:02:39,324 --> 00:02:42,521
Three minutes
until evacuation is complete, sir.

15
00:02:43,362 --> 00:02:46,695
Chinese airspace has been locked
and sealed, one-mile radius.

16
00:02:46,798 --> 00:02:48,789
All right, give NEST team the go.

17
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:50,664
Black Hawks, you're clear to land.

18
00:02:52,004 --> 00:02:54,996
Ding-a-ling!
Come out and get your ice cream.

19
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:01,577
Any bad robot out there
better get ready for an ass-whupping.

20
00:03:07,252 --> 00:03:10,915
For the last two years,
an advance team of new Autobots

21
00:03:11,023 --> 00:03:14,254
has taken refuge here
under my command.

22
00:03:14,693 --> 00:03:16,183
Arcees, get ready to launch.

23
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:17,785
We're locked and loaded.

24
00:03:17,896 --> 00:03:21,923
Together, we form an alliance
with the humans,

25
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:25,197
a secret but brave squad of soldiers.

26
00:03:25,304 --> 00:03:28,205
All right, listen up. China's cover story
on this one is "toxic spill."

27
00:03:28,307 --> 00:03:30,537
They had to evac the area
for search and rescue.

28
00:03:30,642 --> 00:03:33,110
This makes six enemy contacts
in eight months.

29
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:36,375
We gotta make sure this one does not
get out in the public eye, so keep it tight.

30
00:03:36,982 --> 00:03:40,679
A classified strike team called NEST.

31
00:03:40,786 --> 00:03:44,381
We hunt for what remains
of our Decepticon foes

32
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:47,481
hiding in different countries
around the globe.

33
00:03:47,593 --> 00:03:48,890
Roll in Alpha through Echo now.

34
00:03:58,904 --> 00:04:00,132
Move out! Let's go!

35
00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:21,750
All right, Ironhide.
We got echoes. Vamos.

36
00:04:22,794 --> 00:04:24,762
Steel stacks at 2 o'clock.

37
00:04:36,108 --> 00:04:39,509
He's here. I smell him.

38
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:46,008
It's close. It's getting closer.

39
00:04:50,922 --> 00:04:53,186
- Oh, no.
- What have you got?

40
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,517
Thermal ripple.

41
00:04:57,663 --> 00:05:00,530
Right, everybody, be steady.
We're right on top of it.

42
00:05:12,744 --> 00:05:14,405
Eagle niner!

43
00:05:14,513 --> 00:05:16,174
I need an energy proton.

44
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:32,854
Panther 1, requesting fire mission now!

45
00:05:33,532 --> 00:05:35,397
Gunships on station. Roll in hot!

46
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,263
Dog 1, now we are engaging.

47
00:05:46,611 --> 00:05:47,805
We got a second Decepticon.

48
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:53,680
Arcee twins! Target coming your way!

49
00:05:58,423 --> 00:06:00,152
I got him, I got him!

50
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:33,247
I screwed that up. I'm okay. I'm all right.

51
00:06:33,358 --> 00:06:35,519
- This is combat, man.
- Total brain freeze, man.

52
00:06:35,627 --> 00:06:36,651
What's wrong with you?

53
00:06:40,365 --> 00:06:42,128
Bring in Sideswipe!

54
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:45,493
Clear a path!

55
00:07:01,386 --> 00:07:02,683
Damn, I'm good!

56
00:07:12,164 --> 00:07:15,497
Air support, we need Big Buddha
to deliver the drop now!

57
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,000
Cyclone 98, final attack hitting in 120.

58
00:07:18,103 --> 00:07:22,301
Clear to drop in
five, four, three, two, one.

59
00:07:35,587 --> 00:07:38,647
Autobots, I'm in pursuit!

60
00:08:07,452 --> 00:08:08,817
Pull over!

61
00:08:29,574 --> 00:08:31,906
Punk-ass Decepticon!

62
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,308
Any last words?

63
00:08:34,412 --> 00:08:38,109
This is not your planet to rule!

64
00:08:38,216 --> 00:08:40,514
The Fallen shall rise again.

65
00:08:42,254 --> 00:08:43,687
That doesn't sound good.

66
00:08:43,922 --> 00:08:45,890
Not today.

67
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:53,528
Come on, let's go! All hands on deck!

68
00:08:53,632 --> 00:08:56,396
Frankie, Mojo, out!
Come on, kiddo, we're on a schedule.

69
00:08:56,501 --> 00:08:58,969
Slow down, Dad. Why are you
in such a hurry to get rid of me?

70
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,664
- Did you rent the room out?
- No, I got other ideas for your room

71
00:09:01,773 --> 00:09:03,900
and it rhymes with "home theater."

72
00:09:09,114 --> 00:09:12,777
Look what I found.
It's your little baby booties.

73
00:09:13,885 --> 00:09:17,286
- Ma.
- My little baby-bootie boy.

74
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:19,152
- You can't go.
- You see this, Dad? This is how

75
00:09:19,257 --> 00:09:20,588
you're supposed to react
when the fruit of your loins

76
00:09:20,692 --> 00:09:22,956
goes out into the cruel world
to fend for himself, okay?

77
00:09:23,061 --> 00:09:25,495
Yeah, my heart bleeds for you, pal.
College, bummer!

78
00:09:25,597 --> 00:09:29,590
You have to come home every holiday,
not just big ones.

79
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:31,669
You have to come home for Halloween.

80
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:32,998
Well, I can't
come home for Halloween, Mom.

81
00:09:33,104 --> 00:09:34,503
- Well, then we'll come to you.
- You're not coming.

82
00:09:34,606 --> 00:09:35,732
- No, we're not going anywhere.
- We'll dress up.

83
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,137
We'll be in costumes.
You'll never know it's us.

84
00:09:37,242 --> 00:09:38,800
- You can't do that, Mom.
- Would you let the kid breathe,

85
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,673
for crying out loud? Come on. Go pack.

86
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:42,269
There's no way you're packed
for a month-long trip.

87
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,611
Come on, chop, chop!
Let's go. March, young lady.

88
00:09:46,785 --> 00:09:48,446
- Dad.
- I love it when you call me "young lady,"

89
00:09:48,553 --> 00:09:50,578
- you dirty old man.
- You ain't seen nothing yet.

90
00:09:50,689 --> 00:09:52,714
- Dad, Dad, Dad, whoa!
- What?

91
00:09:52,824 --> 00:09:55,190
I'm watching what you're doing, Dad.
It's not a rap video.

92
00:09:55,293 --> 00:09:56,590
It's just like a coach thing.

93
00:09:56,695 --> 00:09:58,560
That was
a really creepy move just now, Dad.

94
00:09:58,663 --> 00:10:03,760
Look. You know, your mother and me
are really proud of you.

95
00:10:03,868 --> 00:10:06,302
You're the first Witwicky
ever to go to college.

96
00:10:06,404 --> 00:10:10,033
Now I'm crying again! This sucks!

97
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:11,904
You're gonna be okay, Ma.

98
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,443
You know, it's just going to be,

99
00:10:13,545 --> 00:10:19,313
you know, hard for her to accept
that her boy's all grown up, you know,

100
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:22,352
going out to handle the world
on his own.

101
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:24,684
- You okay, Pop?
- Yeah.

102
00:10:24,789 --> 00:10:27,314
Mojo, no dominating Frankie!

103
00:10:27,425 --> 00:10:30,724
Get the hell off the couch,
you filthy beasts!

104
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:32,854
You'll see a lot of that in college, too.

105
00:10:32,964 --> 00:10:36,092
- What are you talking about, Dad?
- There's gonna be a lot of women there.

106
00:10:36,201 --> 00:10:37,828
Yeah, well,
I'm a one-woman kind of guy.

107
00:10:37,936 --> 00:10:39,267
Look, Mikaela's the greatest,

108
00:10:39,371 --> 00:10:41,965
but you gotta give each other
room to grow, okay?

109
00:10:42,073 --> 00:10:44,303
You're no different
than any other couple your age.

110
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:46,570
Except we discovered
an alien race together.

111
00:10:46,678 --> 00:10:48,043
How long you gonna be riding
that scooter?

112
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,084
Dad, listen, I know what the odds are.
We're the exception, okay?

113
00:11:02,193 --> 00:11:05,026
Wait a second. Who could that be?

114
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,927
In two weeks, it could be Muffy.

115
00:11:07,032 --> 00:11:08,226
Hey, beautiful.

116
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:10,601
- I'm breaking up with you, Sam.
- Really?

117
00:11:10,702 --> 00:11:12,135
You sure?
I'm not hearing a lot of conviction.

118
00:11:12,237 --> 00:11:15,764
Well, I am, okay? So, there's no reason
for me to come say good-bye to you.

119
00:11:16,274 --> 00:11:18,105
Wow, you almost sounded serious
that time.

120
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:22,041
Guess what? I made you
a long-distance relationship kit.

121
00:11:22,147 --> 00:11:24,547
Yeah, I got you a webcam,
so we can chat 24/7.

122
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:25,809
All Witwicky, all the time.

123
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:27,878
And I got you a couple souvenirs
from the event

124
00:11:27,986 --> 00:11:29,248
that cannot be mentioned
on cell phones.

125
00:11:29,354 --> 00:11:32,790
- Some mixes and candles and stuff.
- Sounds cute. I can't wait.

126
00:11:33,124 --> 00:11:35,217
Hey! You want
the infamous D-Day shirt?

127
00:11:35,326 --> 00:11:37,487
You kept your nasty, shredded clothes?

128
00:11:37,729 --> 00:11:39,094
Yeah. Of course, I kept it, Mikaela.

129
00:11:39,197 --> 00:11:41,188
It's like my Super Bowl jersey.
I bled in this thing.

130
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:43,927
- Wow. You're pretty confident, huh?
- No, it's not that.

131
00:11:44,035 --> 00:11:46,401
It's just that my low self-esteem's
at an all-time high.

132
00:11:46,805 --> 00:11:49,740
You think your little box of souvenirs
is gonna keep me from leaving you?

133
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:51,365
You really should come with me.

134
00:11:51,476 --> 00:11:53,205
They got cheap apartments
near campus.

135
00:11:53,311 --> 00:11:56,838
Well, that's not gonna happen
until I get my man-child father,

136
00:11:56,948 --> 00:11:59,576
fresh out of prison, back on his feet.

137
00:11:59,684 --> 00:12:01,982
I heard that.
Where'd you put the clutch covers?

138
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:04,453
- Next to the camshafts.
- I love it when you say "camshafts."

139
00:12:04,556 --> 00:12:05,545
Whisper it to me.

140
00:12:08,193 --> 00:12:09,888
Camshafts.

141
00:12:10,562 --> 00:12:12,052
Why can't I hate you?

142
00:12:13,031 --> 00:12:14,965
It's my Witwicky charm.

143
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:16,761
Wait, hold on. Wait, hold on a second.

144
00:12:16,868 --> 00:12:19,769
I guess we're not breaking up.
I'll be over in 20.

145
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:23,534
Mikaela, I think a sliver of the Cube
got stuck on my shirt.

146
00:12:29,013 --> 00:12:30,071
Sam?

147
00:12:38,189 --> 00:12:39,213
There's a fire!

148
00:12:39,657 --> 00:12:41,454
Dad, we got a fire!

149
00:13:00,345 --> 00:13:01,505
Fire!

150
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:14,217
Ron, did you know
it was gonna be this hard?

151
00:13:14,325 --> 00:13:15,849
Can you just stop?

152
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,622
Yeah, okay, I'll stop. You carry this shit!

153
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,268
- Wow.
- Do you know what?

154
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,603
- What?
- I don't want to go anywhere with you.

155
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:32,835
I don't wanna go to France with you.

156
00:13:32,944 --> 00:13:34,468
I don't wanna go
around the corner with you.

157
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:35,841
- I'm going back inside.
- All right, fine.

158
00:13:35,947 --> 00:13:36,971
I'll call you from Paris.

159
00:13:49,093 --> 00:13:50,890
What is all the racket?

160
00:13:50,995 --> 00:13:51,962
Sam?

161
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,393
Dad!

162
00:13:59,971 --> 00:14:01,871
- What was that?
- That's the whole kitchen!

163
00:14:04,742 --> 00:14:07,472
- Bumblebee... Oh, my...
- Bumblebee!

164
00:14:26,898 --> 00:14:29,890
- 911.
- Bumblebee!

165
00:14:30,702 --> 00:14:32,897
- Get in the garage. Go!
- What the freak just happened?

166
00:14:33,004 --> 00:14:37,236
I'm about to have a nervous breakdown.
Just go in the garage quietly, please.

167
00:14:37,342 --> 00:14:38,832
Holy Mother!

168
00:14:41,813 --> 00:14:44,839
- Oh, my God!
- Whatever.

169
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:47,076
Get in the garage now!

170
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:55,291
- Firemen! Fire fighters, over here!
- Dogs out! Get the dogs out!

171
00:14:55,393 --> 00:14:59,056
This is it! Come on, you guys.
What are you waiting for?

172
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:06,737
My house is on fire!

173
00:15:10,241 --> 00:15:12,232
...very important.
- What happened?

174
00:15:12,343 --> 00:15:17,042
Come here. Listen, I need you to take
the Cube sliver and put it in your purse.

175
00:15:17,148 --> 00:15:18,308
- What's going on?
- Just take it.

176
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,281
- Sam Witwicky? A word with you.
- Yes, Mom. Yeah.

177
00:15:20,385 --> 00:15:22,546
- Hi, Mikaela. I have a bald spot.
- Hi.

178
00:15:22,654 --> 00:15:25,020
- An old furnace, I think.
- From a waffle iron.

179
00:15:25,123 --> 00:15:28,650
When you go, he goes. I cannot live
with a psychotic alien in my garage!

180
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,388
Judy... National security.

181
00:15:31,496 --> 00:15:35,023
Look, if we stay quiet,
they're gonna take care of everything.

182
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:38,432
Just consider this
the official start of our remodel, okay?

183
00:15:38,536 --> 00:15:41,562
Fine. If the government's paying,
I want a pool and a hot tub!

184
00:15:41,673 --> 00:15:44,107
And I'm gonna skinny-dip
and you can't say shit about it!

185
00:15:47,946 --> 00:15:51,347
- Yeah, you know you're in trouble.
- He still having voice problems?

186
00:15:51,449 --> 00:15:53,815
He's playing it up.

187
00:15:53,918 --> 00:15:57,012
Bee, I want to talk to you
about the college thing, okay?

188
00:15:57,121 --> 00:16:00,318
I'm so excited and I just can't hide it

189
00:16:00,425 --> 00:16:02,518
Hey, I'm not taking you with me.

190
00:16:04,028 --> 00:16:06,360
I'm gonna wait outside, okay?

191
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:09,226
I meant to tell you about this earlier.

192
00:16:09,334 --> 00:16:11,768
It's just that, you know...
Here's the thing.

193
00:16:11,869 --> 00:16:14,064
Freshmen aren't allowed to have cars.

194
00:16:14,172 --> 00:16:17,141
I know, and if it was up to me,
I'd take you with me, but it's not, Bee.

195
00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:20,005
Look. You're an Autobot. You shouldn't
be living in my dad's garage.

196
00:16:20,111 --> 00:16:24,480
I mean, you're suffocating in here.
You deserve better than this.

197
00:16:24,582 --> 00:16:26,015
This is hard enough, man.
Don't make it harder.

198
00:16:26,117 --> 00:16:28,483
Can you just look at me, please?

199
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:32,949
Come on, big guy.
Look, the guardian thing is done.

200
00:16:33,057 --> 00:16:36,390
Okay? You did your job.
Look, I'm safe now.

201
00:16:36,494 --> 00:16:38,928
You need to go be with
Optimus Prime and the others.

202
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:42,363
I just want to be normal, Bee.
That's why I'm going to college,

203
00:16:42,467 --> 00:16:44,594
and I can't do that with you.

204
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,531
It's not the last time I'm gonna see you,
you know, Bee.

205
00:16:47,638 --> 00:16:51,404
Come on, don't do that. Bee.
You're killing me, Bee.

206
00:16:53,044 --> 00:16:55,604
But you'll always be my first car.

207
00:16:57,548 --> 00:16:59,175
Love you, Bee.

208
00:17:04,956 --> 00:17:06,014
Wow!

209
00:17:06,257 --> 00:17:09,283
Between State Farm and the taxpayers,
we're all taken care of.

210
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:10,861
- You got dirt all over you.
- Stop. Stop.

211
00:17:10,962 --> 00:17:12,452
- What?
- Stop, I'm okay.

212
00:17:12,563 --> 00:17:13,894
Look.

213
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:17,266
So, you think you can make it through
those East Coast winters without me?

214
00:17:17,368 --> 00:17:19,563
You're the best thing
to ever happen to me.

215
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,662
- And?
- And I'll do anything for you.

216
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:24,601
And?

217
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:27,769
- I think Sam's about to say the L-word.
- Let's go, kiddo!

218
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:28,903
Nice timing, Dad.

219
00:17:29,347 --> 00:17:31,008
I adore you.

220
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,417
That's not the word that I want

221
00:17:33,518 --> 00:17:34,951
- to hear right now.
- What are you talking about?

222
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:36,020
It's the same word as the other word.

223
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,917
- It's not the same word.
- Look, if I say the other word now

224
00:17:38,022 --> 00:17:39,546
and you forced me to say it,
it won't mean anything, plus

225
00:17:39,657 --> 00:17:41,887
you haven't said it either.
So, don't get mad at me for not saying it.

226
00:17:41,993 --> 00:17:44,553
Yeah, but I haven't said it because guys
always run when you say it first.

227
00:17:44,662 --> 00:17:48,291
Yeah, well, so do girls.
Especially girls like you, with options.

228
00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:52,495
So, this is all part of your elaborate plan
to keep me interested?

229
00:17:53,337 --> 00:17:56,170
- It can be.
- I hate that it's working.

230
00:17:57,341 --> 00:17:59,036
Can I have a kiss?

231
00:17:59,677 --> 00:18:01,872
We're going to make it work, I promise.

232
00:18:35,012 --> 00:18:39,005
Soundwave acknowledges. Pursue her.

233
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:41,085
Retrieve it.

234
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,638
Autobot twins, report to Hangar Three.

235
00:19:06,844 --> 00:19:08,573
Bad-ass ice-cream truck
coming through.

236
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:10,510
- Excuse me! Excuse me! Hello!
- No, I don't...

237
00:19:10,615 --> 00:19:11,741
- Hold up.
- Those are nice.

238
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:13,441
Yeah, baby, it's upgrade time.

239
00:19:13,551 --> 00:19:17,214
Yes, sir. Yeah!
Look here, it's my booty call right here!

240
00:19:17,321 --> 00:19:21,155
- Time to get my sexy on with the green.
- Green? No, green is mine!

241
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:22,624
I call green!

242
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,097
- I got the green.
- That hurt, man.

243
00:19:27,198 --> 00:19:29,325
It's supposed to hurt. It's an ass-kicking.

244
00:19:39,877 --> 00:19:41,777
Present arms!

245
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:58,560
Director Galloway, what an honor.
I'd love to show you around,

246
00:19:58,663 --> 00:20:00,153
but you gotta be
on the classified access list.

247
00:20:00,264 --> 00:20:02,824
I am now. Presidential order, Major.

248
00:20:02,934 --> 00:20:05,835
I got a message
for your classified space buddies!

249
00:20:05,937 --> 00:20:07,996
You guys made a mess of Shanghai.

250
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,367
All right, so this is where
we communicate with the JCS

251
00:20:14,478 --> 00:20:17,606
and this area serves
as the Autobots' hangar.

252
00:20:19,517 --> 00:20:22,008
Secure link to JCS is up, Major.

253
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,707
Secure line to
the Pentagon is now open.

254
00:20:47,812 --> 00:20:50,781
- General?
- Will, I saw the Shanghai op.

255
00:20:51,482 --> 00:20:53,347
- We had a rough day out there.
- Yes, sir.

256
00:20:53,818 --> 00:20:56,309
We have intel that I believe
warrants an immediate debrief.

257
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,581
Now with your permission,
I can't let you see him,

258
00:20:58,689 --> 00:21:01,055
but I would like you to hear
from the leader of the Autobots.

259
00:21:01,158 --> 00:21:02,182
Proceed.

260
00:21:20,645 --> 00:21:22,442
You gotta wonder,

261
00:21:22,546 --> 00:21:25,879
if God made us in his image,
who made him?

262
00:21:27,084 --> 00:21:29,245
General, our alliance
has countermanded

263
00:21:29,353 --> 00:21:31,947
six Decepticon incursions this year,

264
00:21:32,056 --> 00:21:34,616
each on a different continent.

265
00:21:34,725 --> 00:21:37,660
They're clearly searching
around the world for something,

266
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:41,095
but last night's encounter
came with a warning.

267
00:21:41,198 --> 00:21:43,860
"The Fallen shall rise again."

268
00:21:43,968 --> 00:21:46,232
"The Fallen." Meaning what?

269
00:21:46,337 --> 00:21:49,738
Origin unknown.
The only recorded history of our race

270
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,004
was contained within the AllSpark
and lost with its destruction.

271
00:21:54,111 --> 00:21:55,635
Excuse me!

272
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,974
With this so-called AllSpark
now destroyed,

273
00:22:01,085 --> 00:22:04,612
why hasn't the enemy left the planet
like you thought they would?

274
00:22:04,722 --> 00:22:06,986
Director Galloway,
our National Security Advisor.

275
00:22:07,091 --> 00:22:10,060
The President just appointed him liaison.

276
00:22:10,161 --> 00:22:12,686
Well, I guess I didn't get that memo.

277
00:22:14,231 --> 00:22:17,792
Forgive the interruption, General.
Excuse me. Coming through.

278
00:22:18,469 --> 00:22:20,232
Excuse me. Excuse me, soldier.

279
00:22:21,972 --> 00:22:23,564
After all the damage in Shanghai,

280
00:22:23,674 --> 00:22:27,610
the President is hard-pressed
to say the job's getting done.

281
00:22:28,946 --> 00:22:33,906
Now, under the classified Alien/Autobot
Cooperation Act,

282
00:22:34,018 --> 00:22:39,513
you agreed to share your intel with us,
but not your advancements in weaponry.

283
00:22:39,623 --> 00:22:43,559
We've witnessed
your human capacity for war.

284
00:22:43,661 --> 00:22:47,188
It would absolutely bring
more harm than good.

285
00:22:47,298 --> 00:22:50,165
But who are you to judge
what's best for us?

286
00:22:50,267 --> 00:22:52,292
With all due respect,
we've been fighting side by side

287
00:22:52,403 --> 00:22:53,927
in the field for two years.

288
00:22:54,038 --> 00:22:57,303
We've shed blood,
sweat and precious metal together.

289
00:22:57,408 --> 00:23:00,104
Soldier, you're paid to shoot, not talk.

290
00:23:00,211 --> 00:23:01,803
Don't tempt me.

291
00:23:01,912 --> 00:23:04,380
And the newest members of your team.

292
00:23:04,482 --> 00:23:06,780
- Easy.
- I understand they arrived here

293
00:23:06,884 --> 00:23:08,749
after you sent a message into space,

294
00:23:08,853 --> 00:23:12,584
an open invitation to come to Earth,
vetted by no one at the White House.

295
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:16,421
Let me stop you right there,
Mr. Galloway. It was vetted right here.

296
00:23:16,527 --> 00:23:20,429
And in my experience, the judgment
of both Major Lennox and his team

297
00:23:20,531 --> 00:23:23,432
has always been above reproach.

298
00:23:23,534 --> 00:23:26,332
Well, be that as it may, General,
it is the position of the President

299
00:23:26,437 --> 00:23:31,932
that when our national security is
at stake, no one is above reproach.

300
00:23:32,676 --> 00:23:35,144
Now, what do we know so far?

301
00:23:35,846 --> 00:23:41,682
We know that the enemy leader,
classified NBE One, aka Megatron,

302
00:23:41,786 --> 00:23:42,787
is rusting in peace at the bottom
of the Laurentian Abyssal,

303
00:23:42,787 --> 00:23:45,347
is rusting in peace at the bottom
of the Laurentian Abyssal,

304
00:23:45,456 --> 00:23:49,950
surrounded by SOSUS detection nets
and a full-time submarine surveillance.

305
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:54,429
We also know that the only remaining
piece of your alien AllSpark

306
00:23:54,532 --> 00:23:56,432
is locked in an electromagnetic vault

307
00:23:56,534 --> 00:23:59,833
here on one of the most secure
naval bases in the world.

308
00:24:01,105 --> 00:24:04,438
Decepticons, we have located the shard.

309
00:24:04,542 --> 00:24:10,378
And since no one can seem to tell me
what the enemy is now after,

310
00:24:10,481 --> 00:24:13,279
well, there's only one clear conclusion!

311
00:24:13,384 --> 00:24:16,217
You! The Autobots!

312
00:24:17,054 --> 00:24:19,318
They're here to hunt you!

313
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:22,390
What's there to hunt for on Earth
besides that?

314
00:24:22,493 --> 00:24:25,360
"The Fallen shall rise again"?

315
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:27,624
It sounds to me
like something's coming.

316
00:24:27,731 --> 00:24:32,498
So, let me ask, if we ultimately conclude
that our national security is best served

317
00:24:32,603 --> 00:24:36,266
by denying you further asylum
on our planet,

318
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:41,276
will you leave peacefully?

319
00:24:41,378 --> 00:24:46,247
Freedom is your right. If you make
that request, we will honor it.

320
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:52,548
But before your President decides,
please ask him this.

321
00:24:53,057 --> 00:24:57,517
What if we leave and you're wrong?

322
00:25:05,135 --> 00:25:07,069
That's a good question.

323
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,703
Oh, my gosh! Look at this place!

324
00:25:14,578 --> 00:25:16,842
I feel smarter already.

325
00:25:17,615 --> 00:25:21,813
- Ron, can you smell it?
- Yeah, smells like $40,000 a year.

326
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,413
- Hey, cheapo!
- Hey, go ahead. We'll get your stuff.

327
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:27,513
Just go ahead and check out your room.

328
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:28,614
Yeah, go.

329
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,229
- Hey.
- Hey.

330
00:25:38,335 --> 00:25:41,202
- You must be Sam, right? I'm Leo.
- Hey.

331
00:25:42,273 --> 00:25:45,800
So, I already set up the crib a bit.
You want this side or that side?

332
00:25:46,677 --> 00:25:49,373
- That side.
- I already chose that side.

333
00:25:51,048 --> 00:25:53,778
You know what this is?
This is the awkward moment.

334
00:25:53,884 --> 00:25:55,442
Yeah, see,
you're trying to see if I'm a normal guy.

335
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:56,815
I'm trying to see if you're a normal guy.

336
00:25:56,921 --> 00:25:58,445
Balanced, unmedicated,
nothing under the crawl space.

337
00:25:58,556 --> 00:25:59,887
Good personal hygiene,
won't stab me in my sleep.

338
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,014
No criminal record, won't steal anything.

339
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:02,649
- Including girlfriends.
- Especially girlfriends.

340
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,990
- You got a girlfriend?
- I do. You?

341
00:26:05,863 --> 00:26:08,457
No, not a chance. You a techie?

342
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:10,761
Sweet! Sharsky,
Fassbinder, where we at?

343
00:26:10,868 --> 00:26:13,098
- Server's almost online, Leo.
- Network's up and running.

344
00:26:13,203 --> 00:26:14,602
Beautiful, that's what I like to hear.

345
00:26:14,705 --> 00:26:17,674
That's Sharsky, that's Fassbinder,
my IT gurus.

346
00:26:17,775 --> 00:26:20,869
Welcome to my empire, bro,
TheRealEffingDeal. Com.

347
00:26:20,978 --> 00:26:22,206
That's me, I'm sure you've heard of it.

348
00:26:22,313 --> 00:26:24,713
- No, I haven't.
- Well, that sucks.

349
00:26:24,815 --> 00:26:26,248
- What is all this for?
- See where I'm going, bro.

350
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:29,285
Look, call me gross,
I want to be a baby billionaire.

351
00:26:29,386 --> 00:26:31,854
Kitten calendars.
That's where I started. Look at me now.

352
00:26:31,956 --> 00:26:33,184
Got to have dreams, bro.

353
00:26:35,459 --> 00:26:37,927
Leo! We got
some brand-new Shanghai vid!

354
00:26:38,028 --> 00:26:40,997
Post it, baby! Go, go, go! FTJ! FTJ!

355
00:26:41,098 --> 00:26:43,464
- What's "FTJ"?
- "Fuel the Jet."

356
00:26:43,567 --> 00:26:44,864
Fuel the Jet, bro.

357
00:26:44,969 --> 00:26:47,301
FTJ. FTJ, legit!

358
00:26:48,639 --> 00:26:49,765
Did you see that? Did you see that?

359
00:26:49,873 --> 00:26:52,341
Look at this. Half of Shanghai gets
wrecked and China says "gas leak."

360
00:26:52,443 --> 00:26:54,809
Don't believe the hype, bro.

361
00:26:54,912 --> 00:26:58,507
Just like the alien robots in LA
two years ago that everyone covered up.

362
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,948
Yeah, I saw these robots,
and they did this, like, firing thing

363
00:27:01,051 --> 00:27:03,281
and they came down and toasted
this woman, and she was like...

364
00:27:03,387 --> 00:27:05,355
- It looks fake to me.
- Dude, it's not fake.

365
00:27:05,456 --> 00:27:08,516
The Internet is pure truth.
Video doesn't lie.

366
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:10,218
- It looks fake.
- No, man, I've seen them.

367
00:27:10,327 --> 00:27:13,524
- They're, like, these robots...
- Look, look, it's fake.

368
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:15,098
Anybody could do it
on any computer, okay?

369
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:17,224
And I wasn't there,

370
00:27:17,334 --> 00:27:19,529
- so I can't comment or speculate.
- No.

371
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:21,832
"Comment or speculate"?
And we're supposed to cohabitate?

372
00:27:21,939 --> 00:27:24,874
No, listen, okay?
Don't be sucking the sack, bro!

373
00:27:24,975 --> 00:27:26,636
- Which sack?
- The ball sack.

374
00:27:26,744 --> 00:27:28,268
Dude, what kind of tool are you?

375
00:27:28,379 --> 00:27:31,371
Mainstream media sack.
They're lying to us, all right?

376
00:27:31,482 --> 00:27:33,814
- It's aliens, man.
- Okay, okay.

377
00:27:33,917 --> 00:27:35,145
Follow me.

378
00:27:36,053 --> 00:27:37,247
Leo, bad news!

379
00:27:37,354 --> 00:27:39,652
We just got scooped.
The video's already up on GFR.

380
00:27:39,757 --> 00:27:41,247
Fassbinder!

381
00:27:42,426 --> 00:27:44,690
Robo-Warrior, the guy's our main
competition on conspiracy stuff.

382
00:27:44,795 --> 00:27:46,786
"Effing" was my F-ing idea
and he stole it!

383
00:27:46,897 --> 00:27:49,388
He's been linking to my site
and thieving hits forever.

384
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,832
By the way, I read your file.
I'm poor, you're poor.

385
00:27:51,935 --> 00:27:55,063
We're gonna fix that, all right?
You work for me now.

386
00:27:56,473 --> 00:27:58,498
I work for you now? That's incredible.

387
00:27:58,609 --> 00:28:01,544
It's first day of college,
I got a career in a dinky Internet firm

388
00:28:01,645 --> 00:28:04,637
with a boss who is made up
of just pure champion stuff.

389
00:28:04,748 --> 00:28:06,716
Are you mocking
my life's work, Samuel?

390
00:28:06,817 --> 00:28:08,307
That's your one warning patrolling,
dude. Don't make me

391
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:10,046
have Fassbinder hack your financial aid,
'cause I'll do it!

392
00:28:10,154 --> 00:28:13,385
Hey, RA. Listen, it's getting a little
intense in my room. Can I switch out?

393
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:18,325
Sad face, 312. No switching, no trading.
Let's turn that frown upside down, okay?

394
00:28:18,429 --> 00:28:19,487
- Oh, here we go.
- We made it. Hi.

395
00:28:19,596 --> 00:28:20,722
It's just like Hogwarts.

396
00:28:20,831 --> 00:28:21,991
- Hi.
- Is this co-ed?

397
00:28:22,099 --> 00:28:23,361
This is a co-ed dorm.

398
00:28:23,467 --> 00:28:24,934
- You guys want to meet my roommates?
- Yeah.

399
00:28:25,035 --> 00:28:26,263
Some real swell guys.

400
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,701
- Here's Leo.
- We're the Witwickys.

401
00:28:27,805 --> 00:28:28,863
- I'm Leo.
- I'm Judy.

402
00:28:28,972 --> 00:28:30,769
Hey, you have a great son, you really do.

403
00:28:30,874 --> 00:28:33,399
- Well, aren't you the sweetest thing?
- Yeah, he's real sweet, Ma.

404
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,636
What is that in your hand, by the way?

405
00:28:34,745 --> 00:28:38,806
I got this at the bake sale for the
environment that those boys are having.

406
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:41,783
You know, you don't often see
white boys with the dreadlocks.

407
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,443
- Mom?
- Yeah, it's 100% pure,

408
00:28:43,554 --> 00:28:45,146
Hawaiian green for the environment.

409
00:28:45,255 --> 00:28:46,722
- How many of these have you eaten?
- Drop it.

410
00:28:46,824 --> 00:28:48,758
- What is this?
- Yeah, they baked it with reefer in it.

411
00:28:48,859 --> 00:28:50,190
- No, it's...
- Please, give me...

412
00:28:50,294 --> 00:28:52,387
Hey! It's my cheat day.
I can eat what I want.

413
00:28:52,496 --> 00:28:54,396
I'm going to freak out.
Please do something right now, Dad.

414
00:28:54,498 --> 00:28:55,692
Please do something right now.

415
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,327
I can eat all the fricking brownies I want!

416
00:28:58,435 --> 00:28:59,459
Come on, let's go.

417
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,037
I'm sorry and you're welcome.

418
00:29:04,308 --> 00:29:05,969
We call it the "Hot Freshman 55."

419
00:29:06,076 --> 00:29:09,011
Sharsky hacked Campus Housing and
stacked the dorm with pretty Betties.

420
00:29:09,113 --> 00:29:11,479
Is... Is so nice...

421
00:29:12,483 --> 00:29:15,941
Oh, my God. That's her. She's coming.
She sees me, she sees me.

422
00:29:18,222 --> 00:29:19,655
She's tied for number one
on my to-do list.

423
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:21,418
Do not bird-dog my quail, you hear me?

424
00:29:21,925 --> 00:29:25,759
Pretty girls! Hey, you.
My son lives in this dorm.

425
00:29:26,497 --> 00:29:29,022
You should go make friends with him.
He's Sam.

426
00:29:29,133 --> 00:29:30,464
Glad she ain't my mama!

427
00:29:30,567 --> 00:29:32,728
And he recently had his cherry popped!

428
00:29:34,271 --> 00:29:36,136
He didn't know I was in the house!
I heard it all!

429
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,867
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Here he is!

430
00:29:38,475 --> 00:29:41,501
He would get in my closet
and dress up as Boy Spice!

431
00:29:41,612 --> 00:29:47,448
- Hey, and his car is a talking robot!
- No, like the GPS. OnStar!

432
00:29:47,951 --> 00:29:49,350
- OnStar.
- Frisbee!

433
00:29:50,487 --> 00:29:53,479
No, Dad! Dad, you just gonna
let her run around the school?

434
00:29:57,895 --> 00:30:01,331
- Give it! Mine, mine, mine!
- Hey! Crazy!

435
00:30:01,431 --> 00:30:03,558
- You want it?
- I want it.

436
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:07,068
Judy, Judy, just... Just put it down.

437
00:30:07,171 --> 00:30:09,537
- You gotta control your mother.
- I don't know who this woman is.

438
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,165
Hey, Professor, I'd do anything for an A.

439
00:30:12,276 --> 00:30:15,109
All right, Grace Slick. We got
some snacks in the car. Let's go.

440
00:30:15,212 --> 00:30:18,079
- Did you get the booties? All right.
- Yes, Dad, I got the booties!

441
00:30:18,615 --> 00:30:19,946
I'm upside down!

442
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:53,510
Black Lion X-Ray,
this is Black Lion Tango.

443
00:30:53,617 --> 00:30:57,451
We have activation of motion sensors
on the western perimeter fence.

444
00:32:13,163 --> 00:32:15,427
Breach at B-14.

445
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,694
Go, go, go, go!

446
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,675
The shard's gone.

447
00:32:40,457 --> 00:32:41,651
Contact!

448
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,049
Take it down!

449
00:32:44,861 --> 00:32:46,294
- Which way?
- Shoot left!

450
00:32:51,902 --> 00:32:53,460
Knock it down!

451
00:33:02,713 --> 00:33:05,341
First frat party's the game changer.
Boys, we're hunting in the wild now.

452
00:33:05,449 --> 00:33:07,076
So, get your game faces on.

453
00:33:07,184 --> 00:33:09,277
I can't stay long.
I have a webcam date with my girlfriend.

454
00:33:09,386 --> 00:33:10,546
- That's so cool!
- No, it's not.

455
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,587
While he's making out
with his MacBook,

456
00:33:18,695 --> 00:33:20,560
I'm gonna be getting
my Spitzy freaky freak on.

457
00:33:20,664 --> 00:33:22,825
- Let's roll.
- She's hot.

458
00:33:22,933 --> 00:33:24,764
Bro, we're hunting!

459
00:33:27,938 --> 00:33:30,133
- See you, darling.
- Bye, Dad.

460
00:33:30,974 --> 00:33:32,305
Okay.

461
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:40,616
This is our first live chat date.
I've never done it before.

462
00:33:41,718 --> 00:33:42,980
I'm kind of nervous.

463
00:34:10,113 --> 00:34:11,774
- Are you okay?
- No.

464
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:15,543
I was getting a napkin for my drink.

465
00:34:16,553 --> 00:34:18,987
Thanks. Cheers.

466
00:34:19,089 --> 00:34:21,080
- It's Sam, right?
- Yeah.

467
00:34:21,191 --> 00:34:24,820
- I wanna dance.
- What, like... Like dancing?

468
00:34:25,662 --> 00:34:27,994
Like a pairing? Like a duo?
Like a coupling?

469
00:34:28,098 --> 00:34:32,865
'Cause I'm in a permanently semi...
I'm in a relationship, kind of...

470
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:37,304
- Relax. I just want to have some fun.
- Wanna have some fun?

471
00:34:37,407 --> 00:34:41,366
Yeah, okay. Let's play some checkers.
You can sit over there and...

472
00:34:43,313 --> 00:34:44,337
Oh, my...

473
00:34:44,448 --> 00:34:48,043
So, how about tonight
you pretend I'm your girlfriend

474
00:34:48,151 --> 00:34:50,244
and I pretend that you're my boyfriend?

475
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:03,498
Hey! Who drove
the freaking yellow Camaro?

476
00:35:04,801 --> 00:35:06,928
There is a car on the lawn!

477
00:35:10,841 --> 00:35:11,967
What are you doing?

478
00:35:12,075 --> 00:35:13,542
Houston, we have a problem.

479
00:35:13,643 --> 00:35:14,701
- What is it?
- Freshman!

480
00:35:14,811 --> 00:35:16,278
- Yeah?
- Is that your car in our bushes?

481
00:35:16,379 --> 00:35:20,247
No, there's a friend of mine,
he just went to get you a tighter shirt.

482
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:23,046
There isn't a tighter shirt! We checked.

483
00:35:23,153 --> 00:35:24,745
Now how about
I park my foot in your ass?

484
00:35:24,855 --> 00:35:26,482
- What size shoe do you wear?
- Yeah?

485
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:28,558
- Hold on.
- You wanna try?

486
00:35:28,658 --> 00:35:31,491
- I'll back it up right now.
- Get him out of here.

487
00:35:31,595 --> 00:35:34,291
You have a ride?
Bro, why are you holding out on us?

488
00:35:34,397 --> 00:35:35,489
I've only known you 17 hours.

489
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:39,057
This is gonna really change our lives.
You have no idea.

490
00:35:39,169 --> 00:35:43,367
- I love Camaros.
- I can't do this right now, okay?

491
00:35:43,473 --> 00:35:45,338
- Don't be a wimp.
- Oh, God!

492
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:57,982
- My first car was my dad's '92 Z28.
- Yeah?

493
00:35:58,088 --> 00:36:02,821
Fuel-injected.
The roar of the engine, it just tickles me.

494
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,226
We shouldn't stare...

495
00:36:06,329 --> 00:36:09,787
I mean, share stories
with each other at all.

496
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,164
Come on, Sam. Just one ride.

497
00:36:12,269 --> 00:36:14,760
Your cheatin' heart

498
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:20,001
Don't. Don't!

499
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:22,840
She's a super freak, super freak
She's super freaky

500
00:36:22,946 --> 00:36:26,074
- Is your radio broken?
- No, my concentration is.

501
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:27,912
We're not cheating.

502
00:36:29,052 --> 00:36:30,542
Not yet.

503
00:36:33,924 --> 00:36:35,892
Is something wrong here?

504
00:36:40,297 --> 00:36:42,060
God! You okay?

505
00:36:44,634 --> 00:36:46,067
She's mighty, mighty

506
00:36:46,169 --> 00:36:49,400
I really don't know what to tell you.
This car has a lot of problems. A lot...

507
00:36:55,579 --> 00:36:57,604
Oh, God! It's in my mouth!

508
00:36:58,114 --> 00:37:00,082
Are you okay? I got Wetnaps.

509
00:37:00,183 --> 00:37:02,515
I got Wetnaps for your face! Hold on!

510
00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:04,678
I... I'm so sorry!

511
00:37:06,523 --> 00:37:07,547
What are you doing?

512
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,529
You won't give me a day, huh?

513
00:37:23,206 --> 00:37:26,437
- You won't give me one day in college?
- I'm sorry, Sam,

514
00:37:26,543 --> 00:37:29,842
but the last fragment of the AllSpark
was stolen.

515
00:37:29,946 --> 00:37:31,777
Like what? Like Decepticons stole it?

516
00:37:31,881 --> 00:37:35,874
We placed it under human protection
at your government's request,

517
00:37:35,986 --> 00:37:38,750
but I'm here for your help, Sam,

518
00:37:38,888 --> 00:37:43,257
because your leaders believe we
brought vengeance upon your planet.

519
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,351
Perhaps they are right.

520
00:37:45,462 --> 00:37:50,525
That is why they must be reminded by
another human of the trust we share.

521
00:37:50,634 --> 00:37:53,296
- This isn't my war.
- Not yet,

522
00:37:54,204 --> 00:37:56,764
but I fear it soon will be.

523
00:37:56,873 --> 00:38:00,400
Your world must not share
the same fate as Cybertron.

524
00:38:01,678 --> 00:38:03,646
Whole generations lost.

525
00:38:07,517 --> 00:38:10,543
I know, and I want to help you, I do,

526
00:38:10,654 --> 00:38:13,714
but I am not some alien ambassador,
you know?

527
00:38:13,823 --> 00:38:15,586
I'm a normal kid with normal problems.

528
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:19,026
I am where I'm supposed to be.

529
00:38:21,731 --> 00:38:23,392
I'm sorry. I...

530
00:38:25,101 --> 00:38:26,159
I really am.

531
00:38:26,269 --> 00:38:30,035
Sam, fate rarely calls upon us
at a moment of our choosing.

532
00:38:30,874 --> 00:38:33,672
You're Optimus Prime.
You don't need me.

533
00:38:34,678 --> 00:38:37,943
We do, more than you know.

534
00:39:11,181 --> 00:39:15,584
Conn, Sonar. Gained new contact,
bearing 214, and possible hostile,

535
00:39:15,685 --> 00:39:17,653
confirmed for
Project Deep Six Drop Point.

536
00:39:17,754 --> 00:39:20,450
- What do you got?
- SU pulled five contacts at 5,000 feet,

537
00:39:20,557 --> 00:39:21,717
diving fast.

538
00:39:26,029 --> 00:39:28,020
Never seen anything
dive that deep that fast.

539
00:39:28,131 --> 00:39:31,623
- Man battle stations.
- Chief of the watch, man battle stations!

540
00:39:31,735 --> 00:39:33,566
Helm, left full rudder,
all ahead two-thirds.

541
00:39:33,937 --> 00:39:36,371
- Left full rudder, two-thirds.
- Dive, go deep.

542
00:39:58,595 --> 00:40:00,790
The nets protecting NBE One
are screaming, sir.

543
00:40:00,897 --> 00:40:04,765
That is 9,300 fathoms down.
And no confirmed DSRVs on site?

544
00:40:04,868 --> 00:40:06,995
- None, sir.
- Then, people, we've got a problem!

545
00:40:17,147 --> 00:40:21,277
Need parts! Kill the little one!

546
00:40:28,792 --> 00:40:30,885
The shard make Energon!

547
00:40:43,673 --> 00:40:47,074
Conn, Sonar. Now hold six contacts,
and they're coming up fast!

548
00:40:47,177 --> 00:40:49,509
- Sound collision alarm.
- Left hard rudder.

549
00:40:50,947 --> 00:40:52,380
Five hundred feet.

550
00:40:53,149 --> 00:40:55,379
Angel Six,
we got six hostiles coming up.

551
00:41:03,393 --> 00:41:05,588
- Collision imminent port side.
- One hundred feet.

552
00:41:05,695 --> 00:41:06,684
Brace for impact.

553
00:41:33,323 --> 00:41:36,292
Starscream, I'm home.

554
00:41:36,392 --> 00:41:41,455
Lord Megatron, I was so relieved
to hear of your resurrection.

555
00:41:41,564 --> 00:41:45,728
You left me to die
on that pathetic insect planet.

556
00:41:45,835 --> 00:41:50,670
Only to help spawn our new army.
The Fallen decrees it!

557
00:41:50,773 --> 00:41:55,073
After all, in your absence,
someone had to take command.

558
00:41:57,046 --> 00:42:00,413
- So disappointing.
- Hatchlings! Hatchlings! Careful, fragile!

559
00:42:00,517 --> 00:42:04,578
Even in death,
there is no command but mine.

560
00:42:10,426 --> 00:42:13,987
My master, I failed you on Earth.

561
00:42:14,097 --> 00:42:19,694
The AllSpark is destroyed
and without it, our race will perish.

562
00:42:20,603 --> 00:42:26,166
You have much to learn, my disciple.
The Cube was merely a vessel.

563
00:42:26,276 --> 00:42:29,905
Its power, its knowledge,
can never be destroyed.

564
00:42:30,013 --> 00:42:34,575
- It can only transform.
- How is that possible?

565
00:42:34,684 --> 00:42:38,245
It has been absorbed
by the human child.

566
00:42:38,354 --> 00:42:43,348
The key to saving our race
now lies within his mind.

567
00:42:43,459 --> 00:42:47,054
Well, then, let me strip
the very flesh from his body!

568
00:42:47,163 --> 00:42:50,621
And you will, my apprentice, in time.

569
00:42:50,733 --> 00:42:56,000
For millennia, I have dreamed
of my return to that wretched planet

570
00:42:56,105 --> 00:43:02,669
where I, too, was once betrayed
by the Primes I called my brothers.

571
00:43:03,546 --> 00:43:10,349
Only a Prime can defeat me,
and now, only one remains.

572
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,053
Optimus! He protects the boy.

573
00:43:14,157 --> 00:43:17,422
Then the boy will lead us to him

574
00:43:17,527 --> 00:43:22,988
- and revenge will be ours.
- Yes.

575
00:43:24,033 --> 00:43:28,197
The boy will not escape us.
We have him in our sights.

576
00:43:29,372 --> 00:43:33,308
Without more Energon,
the hatchlings will keep dying.

577
00:43:38,815 --> 00:43:43,115
Space. Time. Gravity.

578
00:43:47,023 --> 00:43:50,151
- Thank you.
- Finish that for me.

579
00:43:50,259 --> 00:43:53,092
We're going on a journey together,
you and I, today.

580
00:43:53,196 --> 00:43:58,156
All you eager, nubile, young minds
on the very cusp of adulthood.

581
00:43:59,035 --> 00:44:02,027
And I shall be your consort, your guide,

582
00:44:02,138 --> 00:44:06,097
your chaperone,
into the heart of darkness.

583
00:44:08,711 --> 00:44:10,941
Welcome to Astronomy 101.

584
00:44:12,181 --> 00:44:15,548
For what do we know about the stars?

585
00:44:16,152 --> 00:44:19,519
Virgo, the virgin.

586
00:44:20,723 --> 00:44:22,554
Orion, the great hunter.

587
00:44:22,659 --> 00:44:27,255
These are no mere twinkling diamonds
for lovely maidens to wish upon.

588
00:44:27,363 --> 00:44:29,661
No, they are dynamos

589
00:44:29,766 --> 00:44:34,362
filled with a throbbing,
savage and pent-up energy!

590
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:40,136
Behold the work of Albert Einstein,
a professor once, like moi.

591
00:44:40,243 --> 00:44:41,710
- Energy equals mass...
- What you doing?

592
00:44:41,811 --> 00:44:43,244
Put your hand down.
Put your hand down.

593
00:44:43,346 --> 00:44:45,746
Young man, there are no questions

594
00:44:45,848 --> 00:44:47,782
until I've reached
the climax of my lecture.

595
00:44:47,884 --> 00:44:51,183
I just finished your book and there's
only one problem. Einstein's wrong.

596
00:44:51,954 --> 00:44:53,285
Energy does equal
mass times the velocity

597
00:44:53,389 --> 00:44:54,447
of light squared in this dimension,

598
00:44:54,557 --> 00:44:57,492
but what about the other 17? We haven't
even talked about the other 17.

599
00:44:58,161 --> 00:44:59,788
Clear example.

600
00:45:03,533 --> 00:45:04,830
Break down the elemental components
of Energon,

601
00:45:04,934 --> 00:45:07,402
assume a constant decay rate
and extrapolate for each of the...

602
00:45:07,503 --> 00:45:08,902
Fourteen galactic convergences it took

603
00:45:09,005 --> 00:45:12,600
the Sentinel Prime expedition
to receive an... Echo on its signal,

604
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:14,643
you wind up with a formula
for inter-dimensional energy increase

605
00:45:14,744 --> 00:45:16,143
that mass and light alone
can't possibly explain.

606
00:45:16,245 --> 00:45:18,509
Come on, guys, I can't be
the only one in the class who...

607
00:45:18,614 --> 00:45:23,347
Young man, I will not be
punk'd in front of the dean.

608
00:45:24,754 --> 00:45:28,121
No, this is my universe here.

609
00:45:28,224 --> 00:45:33,560
Do you understand?
I am the alpha and the omega.

610
00:45:33,663 --> 00:45:36,063
- Get out of my class!
- Yes, sir.

611
00:45:39,168 --> 00:45:41,728
Anyone else care to have
some sort of mental breakdown?

612
00:45:51,681 --> 00:45:56,778
Hi, Bones! Hi. Hi.
You're such a good boy.

613
00:45:57,487 --> 00:45:59,648
What a good boy, you are.

614
00:46:04,193 --> 00:46:06,889
Hey, Bones. Are you hungry?

615
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,491
Come on, check that out.

616
00:46:14,504 --> 00:46:16,165
There you go.

617
00:46:23,513 --> 00:46:25,538
- Yes, Samuel?
- Hello? Mikaela?

618
00:46:25,648 --> 00:46:28,208
I can't believe you're gonna stand me up
on our first web chat date.

619
00:46:28,317 --> 00:46:31,081
- Something just happened to me, okay?
- What, you finally hit puberty?

620
00:46:31,187 --> 00:46:32,779
No, no, no. Stop laughing.
This is serious. Okay.

621
00:46:32,889 --> 00:46:34,584
Remember I was telling you
about my great-great-grandfather,

622
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:36,453
Archibald Witwicky? Remember?

623
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:39,619
Watch it, watch it, watch... No!
Okay, remember how I was telling you...

624
00:46:39,729 --> 00:46:42,027
Okay. Can you stop?
Watch the foot! Watch your foot!

625
00:46:42,131 --> 00:46:43,120
Mikaela, okay,

626
00:46:43,232 --> 00:46:45,291
my great-great-grandfather
went on this Arctic mission, right?

627
00:46:45,401 --> 00:46:46,959
And he saw Megatron.
Megatron zapped him,

628
00:46:47,069 --> 00:46:48,934
and he started seeing
these crazy symbols. Okay.

629
00:46:49,038 --> 00:46:50,437
Well, now I'm seeing them, too.
Excuse me.

630
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:52,974
I just read a 903-page astronomy book
in 32.6 seconds.

631
00:46:53,075 --> 00:46:54,440
I had a meltdown
in the middle of my class.

632
00:46:54,544 --> 00:46:56,671
I am seeing symbols ever since I...

633
00:46:57,947 --> 00:47:01,906
- Since what?
- Ever since I touched the Cube splinter.

634
00:47:02,018 --> 00:47:04,009
- Do you have it?
- Yeah, I have it.

635
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:07,954
- It's in the shop safe. It's fine.
- Mikaela, do not touch it, okay?

636
00:47:08,057 --> 00:47:09,581
- Don't touch it.
- I'm not gonna touch it.

637
00:47:09,926 --> 00:47:11,484
Sam, it's fine. It's locked away.

638
00:47:11,594 --> 00:47:13,926
- No one knows where it is.
- I do!

639
00:47:16,098 --> 00:47:18,726
You're hot, but you ain't too bright.

640
00:47:20,469 --> 00:47:22,903
There we go. Yeah, that'll work.

641
00:47:25,208 --> 00:47:27,233
Damn it! Son of a bitch!

642
00:47:29,512 --> 00:47:32,242
What are you looking at, slobber puss?

643
00:47:33,216 --> 00:47:36,811
What the... This place is
a freaking house of horrors!

644
00:47:39,956 --> 00:47:41,787
Pain... It hurts...

645
00:47:43,059 --> 00:47:44,321
Hold on.

646
00:47:47,029 --> 00:47:49,361
Right to five, then...

647
00:47:57,707 --> 00:48:00,870
Is that the best you got, huh?
Is that the best you can do?

648
00:48:02,378 --> 00:48:04,471
What are you doing here,
you little freak?

649
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:07,105
That's my eye, you crazy bitch!

650
00:48:07,216 --> 00:48:11,414
- You gonna talk now?
- I seek knowledge from the Cube.

651
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,249
- The Fallen demands me!
- What knowledge?

652
00:48:13,356 --> 00:48:15,950
You got the shard, I need the shard.
Give me the shard. I need the shard.

653
00:48:16,058 --> 00:48:18,549
They're gonna whack me!
I'm gonna be dead without that shard!

654
00:48:18,661 --> 00:48:21,755
Easy, warrior goddess,
I'm just a little salvage-scrap drone!

655
00:48:21,864 --> 00:48:25,129
- And I'm your worst nightmare.
- Hey, hey, hey!

656
00:48:25,234 --> 00:48:26,633
- What the hell was that?
- I'll tell you later,

657
00:48:26,736 --> 00:48:28,226
just not on an open phone line, okay?

658
00:48:28,337 --> 00:48:29,361
I'm gonna get on a plane right now

659
00:48:29,472 --> 00:48:31,633
and I'll be there later this afternoon.
Just be careful, Sam.

660
00:48:39,782 --> 00:48:42,649
And have any strangers given you
anything suspicious to carry on today?

661
00:48:42,752 --> 00:48:44,447
Yeah, a live bomb!

662
00:48:44,553 --> 00:48:45,781
- No.
- Good.

663
00:48:58,534 --> 00:49:01,128
Major, incoming SOS from Autobots!

664
00:49:01,237 --> 00:49:05,003
Multiple Decepticon contacts in motion.
Vicinity, eastern United States, sir!

665
00:49:05,107 --> 00:49:08,076
- As in how many?
- Unclear, sir.

666
00:49:08,177 --> 00:49:09,508
Well, get clear.

667
00:49:14,317 --> 00:49:17,081
The Autobots are on the move,
splitting into two teams, sir.

668
00:49:17,186 --> 00:49:18,244
They're not answering our calls

669
00:49:18,354 --> 00:49:19,912
and they're heading to
New York and Philadelphia.

670
00:49:20,022 --> 00:49:23,185
All right, full weapons deployment.
Wheels up in 20 minutes!

671
00:49:24,093 --> 00:49:25,253
Move it!

672
00:49:27,163 --> 00:49:28,494
Let's go!

673
00:49:33,803 --> 00:49:36,863
Flight 57, welcome to Philadelphia.

674
00:49:37,606 --> 00:49:41,064
Alicia, mi amor, can I interest you
in an 18-inch Zookeeper's special?

675
00:49:41,177 --> 00:49:43,645
Extra-large, triple cheese,
with every known animal as a topping.

676
00:49:43,746 --> 00:49:45,771
Basically, I've got,
like, 18 inches of meat.

677
00:49:45,881 --> 00:49:48,441
Unless you're vegetarian.
All right. It's cool. I am, too.

678
00:49:48,551 --> 00:49:51,816
- Sam home?
- Sam? I think he died,

679
00:49:51,921 --> 00:49:53,218
but why don't we check?

680
00:49:53,322 --> 00:49:55,153
- Here we are.
- Hey!

681
00:49:55,257 --> 00:49:56,417
You ever have a song stuck
in your head? It's like

682
00:49:56,525 --> 00:49:58,459
the worst song ever,
but you can't help to whistle it or sing it

683
00:49:58,561 --> 00:50:02,224
'cause it, like, repeats itself, repeats
itself, repeats itself, repeats itself?

684
00:50:02,331 --> 00:50:04,424
Kitten calendar,
kitten calendar, kitten calendar,

685
00:50:04,533 --> 00:50:05,864
- kitten calendar...
- Dude, what the eff?

686
00:50:05,968 --> 00:50:08,027
I know you're freaking out.
Don't freak out. Don't freak out.

687
00:50:08,137 --> 00:50:10,162
Easy fix. Puzzle code in my head.

688
00:50:10,272 --> 00:50:11,830
Now it's on the walls.
Everything is good.

689
00:50:11,941 --> 00:50:14,000
This is the part that...

690
00:50:17,747 --> 00:50:18,907
Okay, what were you saying?

691
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:22,348
Alice, I'm horrified you had to see this.
Let's go.

692
00:50:22,451 --> 00:50:23,782
Get out.

693
00:50:23,886 --> 00:50:25,717
Wait, wait, wait!
Can I just sit and watch?

694
00:50:25,821 --> 00:50:27,914
I'll... I'll eat my pizza quietly.

695
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:30,925
Sam, I knew there was
something special about you.

696
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:32,289
Really?

697
00:50:33,763 --> 00:50:35,924
And I know you know what happens

698
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:38,933
when two people in the know
get together.

699
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:42,266
They're genuinely amazing in bed.

700
00:50:44,173 --> 00:50:45,572
Thank you.

701
00:50:46,876 --> 00:50:48,400
All right, listen, hold on! Boundaries.

702
00:50:48,511 --> 00:50:53,539
- Flag on the play. Okay. I'm very ticklish.
- We have needs, Sam. Relax.

703
00:50:53,649 --> 00:50:54,843
Jeez!

704
00:50:56,786 --> 00:50:59,846
What about this economy?
It's crazy, isn't it?

705
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:04,954
- You are very aggressive.
- Just relax.

706
00:51:05,127 --> 00:51:07,391
You want some turkey meatloaf?

707
00:51:12,435 --> 00:51:13,697
Sam?

708
00:51:16,038 --> 00:51:18,563
- Mikaela!
- Is that your girlfriend?

709
00:51:19,842 --> 00:51:20,809
Ex.

710
00:51:21,811 --> 00:51:24,006
Mikaela! Wait!

711
00:51:25,815 --> 00:51:27,749
I can explain...

712
00:51:46,235 --> 00:51:48,226
Sam, your bed buddy, Alice...

713
00:52:07,289 --> 00:52:08,278
All right, come on.

714
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:09,914
- She's coming!
- She's an alien robot! You gotta move.

715
00:52:10,025 --> 00:52:11,322
- Is this real?
- Just run!

716
00:52:17,633 --> 00:52:20,568
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I can't believe
I almost had sex with her in my dream!

717
00:52:20,669 --> 00:52:22,364
I can tell
that you really missed me a lot, Sam!

718
00:52:22,471 --> 00:52:23,836
- Look, it's not my fault, okay?
- It's not your fault?

719
00:52:23,939 --> 00:52:25,338
Listen! Listen, I'm a victim!

720
00:52:25,441 --> 00:52:26,738
- You were a victim? Of what?
- Yeah.

721
00:52:26,842 --> 00:52:28,673
- Of what, a little 80-pound girl?
- Of... Of molestation.

722
00:52:28,777 --> 00:52:30,438
It was like getting humped
in the neck by a mountain ox!

723
00:52:30,546 --> 00:52:31,877
You didn't have to put your tongue
in her mouth!

724
00:52:31,981 --> 00:52:33,073
- I didn't! Look!
- You did!

725
00:52:33,182 --> 00:52:35,673
You ever had your stomach tongued by
a mountain ox with a five-foot tongue?

726
00:52:35,784 --> 00:52:38,912
It's not fun for me, okay, Mikaela?
And it smelled like... Like diesel!

727
00:52:39,054 --> 00:52:42,353
- Like a diesel-y tinge to it!
- You're such a little girl!

728
00:52:42,458 --> 00:52:44,323
We're gonna have
10 seconds of silence right now.

729
00:52:44,426 --> 00:52:45,620
I'm not talking to you for 10 seconds.

730
00:52:45,728 --> 00:52:47,559
You can't give me the silent treatment!
You know what?

731
00:52:47,663 --> 00:52:50,154
I'm not talking to you for 10 seconds.
You have three seconds left.

732
00:52:50,266 --> 00:52:51,460
You know what?
You can give me the silent treatment

733
00:52:51,567 --> 00:52:53,296
all you want,
but you can't keep me from talking.

734
00:52:53,602 --> 00:52:55,194
- What were you gonna say?
- I hope you had a lot of fun,

735
00:52:55,304 --> 00:52:57,169
because this, this is over.

736
00:52:57,273 --> 00:52:59,673
She violated your orifice
with her nasty alien probe?

737
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:02,005
She did it? She went in there?
All her little embryo alien babies

738
00:53:02,111 --> 00:53:04,944
are gestating and hatching inside of you.
They're growing right now, probably!

739
00:53:05,047 --> 00:53:07,811
You need to vomit it right now.
Yak it! Yak it right now!

740
00:53:07,917 --> 00:53:09,009
Who are you?

741
00:53:09,118 --> 00:53:12,212
I'm Leonardo Ponce De Leon Spitz.
Okay? I'm the key to this.

742
00:53:12,321 --> 00:53:13,879
The aliens,
they want me 'cause of my site.

743
00:53:20,029 --> 00:53:20,996
Whoa, guys, right there!

744
00:53:25,367 --> 00:53:26,527
Run!

745
00:53:30,439 --> 00:53:31,633
Mikaela!

746
00:53:49,391 --> 00:53:51,382
Come on! We gotta move!

747
00:53:51,927 --> 00:53:53,622
It's a bomb!

748
00:54:02,905 --> 00:54:04,167
You've got to get that box!

749
00:54:07,776 --> 00:54:10,870
- This way.
- What? Hey! Let me out, let me out!

750
00:54:12,047 --> 00:54:14,777
Oh, my God, you know how to
hot-wire a car? That's so hot!

751
00:54:14,883 --> 00:54:17,044
Drive, drive, drive!
She's right there! She's right there!

752
00:54:17,152 --> 00:54:19,916
Come on, come on, come on.

753
00:54:20,356 --> 00:54:22,654
Go! Go! Go! Back up the car!

754
00:54:23,892 --> 00:54:25,086
Now!

755
00:54:26,695 --> 00:54:28,026
Tongue!

756
00:54:32,668 --> 00:54:34,295
Oh, my God!

757
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:43,305
Kiss this, bitch!

758
00:54:48,617 --> 00:54:50,585
Drive, drive, drive.

759
00:54:53,422 --> 00:54:54,582
Okay, so what else
don't I know, all right?

760
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:56,419
Since you guys forgot to mention
some minor details.

761
00:54:59,094 --> 00:55:02,086
That thing you saw back there,
that was the little baby...

762
00:55:07,503 --> 00:55:09,835
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Sam!

763
00:55:12,908 --> 00:55:14,307
Sam!

764
00:55:18,681 --> 00:55:20,012
- Sam!
- Hold on!

765
00:55:20,115 --> 00:55:21,377
- Pull me up!
- Hold on!

766
00:55:23,686 --> 00:55:25,586
Sam, get back in!

767
00:55:27,289 --> 00:55:30,417
I don't want to die!
We're gonna die! Oh, my God!

768
00:55:55,884 --> 00:55:57,613
Jesus! Jesus!

769
00:56:05,627 --> 00:56:07,390
Come here, boy.

770
00:56:08,697 --> 00:56:09,994
Closer.

771
00:56:10,699 --> 00:56:11,893
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

772
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,400
You remember me, don't you?

773
00:56:14,503 --> 00:56:16,937
I did what you said, okay?
Just don't hurt us.

774
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:18,301
Shut up!

775
00:56:19,141 --> 00:56:20,301
Sam!

776
00:56:26,548 --> 00:56:30,507
Yeah! Yes, yes.

777
00:56:30,986 --> 00:56:34,114
It feels good to grab your flesh!

778
00:56:35,724 --> 00:56:40,161
I am going to kill you slowly, painfully,

779
00:56:40,262 --> 00:56:44,858
but first, we have
some delicate work to do.

780
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:51,003
How I could snap your limbs off!

781
00:56:51,106 --> 00:56:54,803
Doctor, examine this alien specimen.

782
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:58,768
I'll scan you.
Let's take a look at your face.

783
00:57:01,683 --> 00:57:06,586
I'm the doctor. The odd job. Information!

784
00:57:08,724 --> 00:57:09,952
Yeah!

785
00:57:17,666 --> 00:57:19,861
Beseeching my shard!

786
00:57:19,968 --> 00:57:21,765
Easy or tough way?

787
00:57:44,626 --> 00:57:46,526
- There they are.
- That's what I'm seeing in my head.

788
00:57:46,628 --> 00:57:50,462
These symbols can lead us
to the Energon source.

789
00:57:50,566 --> 00:57:54,662
We must have the brain on the table!

790
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:57,295
- Chop, chop!
- Brain?

791
00:57:57,406 --> 00:57:58,634
What does he mean by my brain?

792
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:01,675
Well, you have something on your mind,
something I need.

793
00:58:01,777 --> 00:58:03,711
Hold on. I know you're pissed.
I know you're pissed

794
00:58:03,812 --> 00:58:05,712
because I tried to kill you
and it's completely understandable.

795
00:58:05,814 --> 00:58:07,213
If somebody tried to kill me,
I'd be upset, too.

796
00:58:07,316 --> 00:58:09,876
I think that we have an opportunity here

797
00:58:09,985 --> 00:58:13,079
to start anew
and develop our relationship

798
00:58:13,188 --> 00:58:15,452
and see where it leads us, okay?

799
00:58:15,557 --> 00:58:18,685
So, you just call Doctor Inspector off
and let's just talk for five seconds!

800
00:58:18,794 --> 00:58:19,954
Wait, wait, wait!

801
00:58:25,634 --> 00:58:28,967
- Come on! Go, go!
- Sam!

802
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:32,901
Go, go, go!

803
00:58:59,101 --> 00:59:00,261
Sam!

804
00:59:07,943 --> 00:59:09,137
Run!

805
00:59:16,218 --> 00:59:17,651
Go, go, go, go!

806
00:59:18,487 --> 00:59:20,011
Here he comes!

807
00:59:26,828 --> 00:59:28,227
Hide, Sam!

808
00:59:38,874 --> 00:59:40,364
Weak!

809
00:59:42,244 --> 00:59:45,611
Puny! Waste of metal!

810
00:59:48,617 --> 00:59:51,017
Junkyard crap!

811
00:59:52,854 --> 00:59:54,321
Decepticons!

812
01:00:03,999 --> 01:00:05,933
Come here, boy.

813
01:00:35,931 --> 01:00:39,230
There is another source of
Energon hidden on this planet.

814
01:00:39,334 --> 01:00:41,359
The boy could lead us to it.

815
01:00:45,874 --> 01:00:47,273
Optimus!

816
01:01:00,555 --> 01:01:05,822
Is the future of our race not worth
a single human life?

817
01:01:05,927 --> 01:01:09,658
- Up! Get up!
- You'll never stop at one!

818
01:01:11,033 --> 01:01:13,058
I'll take you all on!

819
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,930
Piece of tin!

820
01:01:54,776 --> 01:01:56,607
Sam! Where are you?

821
01:01:59,414 --> 01:02:00,472
No!

822
01:02:01,249 --> 01:02:03,740
You're so weak!

823
01:02:28,076 --> 01:02:32,172
The last Prime is dead!

824
01:02:40,789 --> 01:02:45,317
Sam, run. Run.

825
01:02:55,504 --> 01:02:57,301
Autobots, attack!

826
01:03:02,010 --> 01:03:04,342
Bumblebee, get them out of here!

827
01:03:17,592 --> 01:03:19,082
This is Lennox.

828
01:03:31,173 --> 01:03:35,132
- That went well.
- We've lost the boy, Master.

829
01:03:35,243 --> 01:03:37,711
The Autobots
must be shielding their signals.

830
01:03:37,813 --> 01:03:42,045
I can't even rely on you
to swat a simple insect?

831
01:03:43,618 --> 01:03:46,553
- One insect among seven billion!
- Shut up!

832
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:50,181
He could be anywhere.

833
01:03:50,292 --> 01:03:53,728
Then we will force them
to find him for us!

834
01:03:54,396 --> 01:03:57,456
It's time for the world
to know of our presence.

835
01:03:57,566 --> 01:04:00,660
No more disguises. No mercy!

836
01:04:01,002 --> 01:04:04,665
The time has come
for my master's arrival.

837
01:04:08,844 --> 01:04:13,975
Decepticons, mobilize. It is time.

838
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,830
Speaking French is so exciting!

839
01:04:34,002 --> 01:04:35,629
Oh, God, who is this?

840
01:04:37,606 --> 01:04:40,302
Hello? I mean, bonsoir!

841
01:04:41,843 --> 01:04:44,971
- What? Who is this?
- Where is the boy?

842
01:04:45,413 --> 01:04:49,975
For Pete's sakes. I'm not impressed
with your perverted mouth-breathing.

843
01:05:30,258 --> 01:05:31,225
Jeez!

844
01:05:31,326 --> 01:05:33,851
You are invading my space.
I'm gonna have to drop you.

845
01:05:33,962 --> 01:05:35,156
Would you get out of here?

846
01:05:35,263 --> 01:05:37,493
I didn't come all the way across
the ocean to eat a plate of snails.

847
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:38,861
I want to try new things.

848
01:05:38,967 --> 01:05:41,333
Looks like Canadian goose poop.

849
01:05:42,737 --> 01:05:44,068
It's nasty.

850
01:06:56,378 --> 01:06:59,677
Revenge is mine.

851
01:07:16,865 --> 01:07:18,765
Yeah!

852
01:07:21,069 --> 01:07:23,037
... definitely not a plane...

853
01:07:23,138 --> 01:07:25,163
Look, carriers don't just sink.

854
01:07:25,273 --> 01:07:28,367
... a horrible accident or a terrorist
attack or worse...

855
01:07:28,743 --> 01:07:30,711
Negative. NORAD confirmed,

856
01:07:30,812 --> 01:07:35,078
projectile came from beyond our
atmosphere, inbound at 30,000 knots.

857
01:07:49,664 --> 01:07:52,895
Citizens of the human hive,

858
01:07:53,001 --> 01:07:56,368
your leaders have withheld the truth.

859
01:07:56,738 --> 01:08:00,003
You are not alone in this universe.

860
01:08:00,742 --> 01:08:03,768
We have lived among you, hidden,

861
01:08:05,513 --> 01:08:07,481
but no more.

862
01:08:07,816 --> 01:08:12,480
As you've seen,
we can destroy your cities at will,

863
01:08:14,456 --> 01:08:17,619
unless you turn over this boy.

864
01:08:22,630 --> 01:08:29,001
If you resist us, we will destroy
the world as you know it.

865
01:08:29,704 --> 01:08:31,194
What we're hearing
from the German government

866
01:08:31,306 --> 01:08:34,332
is that the world broadcast
was a satellite hacking.

867
01:08:34,442 --> 01:08:37,775
The military has just told us they have
assumed Condition Delta,

868
01:08:38,079 --> 01:08:40,604
which is the highest level
we have been at since 9/11.

869
01:08:40,715 --> 01:08:42,649
President Obama
is being flown to a bunker

870
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:44,377
somewhere in the middle
of the United States

871
01:08:44,486 --> 01:08:48,923
in the face of the worst simultaneous
attacks ever around the globe.

872
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:54,393
The aircraft carrier USS Roosevelt goes
down off the East Coast, all hands lost.

873
01:08:54,496 --> 01:08:57,659
Worldwide casualties
are in the neighborhood of 7,000,

874
01:08:57,765 --> 01:08:59,426
but that number could climb.

875
01:08:59,534 --> 01:09:00,558
It's still too early to tell.

876
01:09:00,668 --> 01:09:03,034
What we need to ask now is,
"Who and why?"

877
01:09:03,138 --> 01:09:06,039
The FBI is still trying to locate
the boy, Sam Witwicky.

878
01:09:06,174 --> 01:09:08,870
We believe they have information
about the attacks.

879
01:09:08,977 --> 01:09:11,275
The FBI, CIA and Interpol

880
01:09:11,379 --> 01:09:14,712
are all seeking the cooperation
of worldwide law enforcement.

881
01:09:14,816 --> 01:09:16,909
You need to listen to this, man.
You gotta check this out.

882
01:09:17,018 --> 01:09:19,612
- They have a traffic-camera spotting...
- They have a picture of me, man.

883
01:09:19,721 --> 01:09:23,122
We're dead, bro.
FBI, CIA, we are wanted fugitives now!

884
01:09:23,424 --> 01:09:24,413
I just need you to focus

885
01:09:24,526 --> 01:09:25,493
- for one minute, man.
- Just stop.

886
01:09:25,593 --> 01:09:27,083
This thing has blown up
to a whole other level, all right?

887
01:09:27,195 --> 01:09:28,890
You know what? Give me this thing.
They can track us.

888
01:09:28,997 --> 01:09:30,931
- Do you see this?
- What?

889
01:09:34,164 --> 01:09:35,256
They can track us?
Like, satellite track us?

890
01:09:35,999 --> 01:09:37,330
Okay, I'm not even with you guys!

891
01:09:37,434 --> 01:09:39,732
Technically, I'm like a hostage.
This is kidnapping...

892
01:09:39,836 --> 01:09:41,098
- Enough is...
- Yo, Leo!

893
01:09:41,471 --> 01:09:43,564
This thing's gonna
give me a heart attack, I swear.

894
01:09:43,673 --> 01:09:46,039
- That's 'cause you is a wuss.
- You guys forced me into that car, right?

895
01:09:46,143 --> 01:09:47,110
I think he's scared.

896
01:09:47,210 --> 01:09:49,701
Hey, Mudflap, what are we gonna do
with this shrimp taco?

897
01:09:49,813 --> 01:09:51,144
Let's pop a cap in his ass,
throw him in the trunk

898
01:09:51,248 --> 01:09:52,772
and then nobody gonna know nothing,
know what I mean?

899
01:09:52,883 --> 01:09:55,750
- Not in my trunk.
- Yo, bumper cars? I'm hearing you.

900
01:09:55,852 --> 01:09:58,047
Okay? I'm right here and I can hear you!

901
01:09:58,155 --> 01:10:00,316
No one's popping any caps
in any asses, okay?

902
01:10:00,423 --> 01:10:01,913
I've had a hell of a day!

903
01:10:03,026 --> 01:10:05,426
Why don't you get a haircut
with your bitch ass?

904
01:10:05,529 --> 01:10:06,655
Go whine to your boyfriend!

905
01:10:06,763 --> 01:10:08,958
Listen, Sam, I know what I'm gonna do,
man. Look, I'm just going to go

906
01:10:09,065 --> 01:10:10,123
to the authorities and tell them the truth.

907
01:10:10,233 --> 01:10:11,222
Like, I had nothing to do with this.

908
01:10:11,334 --> 01:10:12,665
- So, I'm not an accomplice.
- Hey, you wanted this, right?

909
01:10:12,836 --> 01:10:14,201
You wanted the real deal?
Well, that's what this is.

910
01:10:14,304 --> 01:10:15,635
Wake up! You're in the middle of it!

911
01:10:15,739 --> 01:10:18,037
You want to run? Go ahead!
No one's stopping you.

912
01:10:19,042 --> 01:10:20,634
Stop complaining.

913
01:10:56,913 --> 01:10:58,403
What is the meaning of this?

914
01:10:58,748 --> 01:11:00,648
You dare point a gun at me?

915
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:04,481
You want a piece of me?
I will tear you apart!

916
01:11:06,289 --> 01:11:08,883
Drop your weapons! Drop your weapons!

917
01:11:08,992 --> 01:11:10,425
- Tell them to lower their weapons!
- Tell them first.

918
01:11:10,527 --> 01:11:11,551
Tell them to lower their weapons.

919
01:11:11,661 --> 01:11:13,629
Major, there's nothing I can do.
Talk to him.

920
01:11:13,730 --> 01:11:15,595
Your NEST team is deactivated, Major.

921
01:11:16,166 --> 01:11:18,634
You are to cease
anti-Decepticon operations

922
01:11:18,735 --> 01:11:21,067
and return to Diego Garcia
pending further orders.

923
01:11:21,171 --> 01:11:23,503
No, we take our orders directly
from Chairman Morshower, sir.

924
01:11:23,607 --> 01:11:25,370
Well, I'll see your Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff

925
01:11:25,475 --> 01:11:27,966
and I will raise you
a President of the United States.

926
01:11:28,078 --> 01:11:29,511
I have operational command now.

927
01:11:29,613 --> 01:11:31,808
An alien blood feud
has been brought to our shores

928
01:11:31,915 --> 01:11:33,507
for which our soldiers
are paying the price.

929
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:35,642
The secret is out!

930
01:11:35,752 --> 01:11:39,188
This is our war now and we will win it
as we always have,

931
01:11:39,289 --> 01:11:41,189
with a coordinated military strategy.

932
01:11:41,291 --> 01:11:44,260
This fool is terribly misinformed.

933
01:11:44,361 --> 01:11:45,692
You're gonna need every asset
that you've got.

934
01:11:45,795 --> 01:11:47,490
What we need is to draw up battle plans

935
01:11:47,597 --> 01:11:49,724
while we explore
every possible diplomatic solution.

936
01:11:49,833 --> 01:11:51,300
Like what, handing over the kid?

937
01:11:52,669 --> 01:11:54,466
All options are being considered.

938
01:11:55,138 --> 01:11:59,040
Whatever the Decepticons are after,
this is just the start.

939
01:11:59,142 --> 01:12:02,202
- There is no negotiating with them.
- I'm ordering you to stand down.

940
01:12:02,312 --> 01:12:06,373
You won't be needing this anymore.
Get your assets back to base!

941
01:12:06,483 --> 01:12:09,680
And take that pile of scrap metal back
to Diego Garcia.

942
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:12,217
Let's go!

943
01:12:13,223 --> 01:12:17,387
I really don't like that dude.
He's an asshole.

944
01:12:17,494 --> 01:12:19,985
Autobots, report to hangar for transport.

945
01:12:20,096 --> 01:12:25,398
- Ironhide, we should leave this planet.
- That's not what Optimus would want.

946
01:12:44,554 --> 01:12:46,579
There's nothing
that you could have done.

947
01:12:51,261 --> 01:12:53,286
- You okay?
- Yeah.

948
01:12:56,499 --> 01:12:59,297
Bee, if you hate me, I understand.

949
01:13:07,243 --> 01:13:10,269
I messed up. I'm sorry.

950
01:13:12,349 --> 01:13:16,217
Young fella, you are the person
I care about most in my life.

951
01:13:16,319 --> 01:13:19,345
If there's anything you need,
I won't be far away.

952
01:13:21,691 --> 01:13:25,320
He's dead because of me. He came
here to protect me and he's dead.

953
01:13:25,795 --> 01:13:28,525
There's some things
you just can't change.

954
01:13:28,631 --> 01:13:32,761
So, his sacrifice for us would
not have been in vain. Hallelujah!

955
01:13:34,104 --> 01:13:36,368
I'm gonna make it right.
I'm going to turn myself in.

956
01:13:36,473 --> 01:13:38,566
We... We've got to stick together.

957
01:13:43,279 --> 01:13:46,942
- You're not going to do that.
- Yes, I am.

958
01:13:51,054 --> 01:13:54,785
Everything we worked for
will be wiped out in one day!

959
01:13:57,427 --> 01:13:59,588
- You two...
- Huh?

960
01:13:59,696 --> 01:14:00,788
Hey, you know the glyphs?

961
01:14:00,897 --> 01:14:03,331
These? The symbols that have been
rattling around in my head?

962
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:08,102
That's old school, yo.
That's, like... That's Cybertronian.

963
01:14:08,505 --> 01:14:09,767
That's some serious stuff, right there.

964
01:14:09,873 --> 01:14:12,865
They gotta mean something,
like a message or like a map.

965
01:14:12,976 --> 01:14:14,375
Like a map to an Energon source!

966
01:14:14,477 --> 01:14:17,742
- Can you read this?
- Read?

967
01:14:17,847 --> 01:14:20,111
No. We don't really do much reading.
Not so much.

968
01:14:20,216 --> 01:14:22,207
If you can't read it,
we gotta find somebody who can.

969
01:14:22,318 --> 01:14:23,945
Look who came sashaying back!

970
01:14:24,053 --> 01:14:25,611
Hair growing like a Chia Pet.
Look at him.

971
01:14:25,722 --> 01:14:27,519
I had a bit
of a mild panic attack earlier, right?

972
01:14:27,624 --> 01:14:28,750
That's 'cause you're a pussy.

973
01:14:28,858 --> 01:14:30,689
I think I'm allowed that,
considering what I've been through.

974
01:14:31,361 --> 01:14:32,385
I heard you have a problem.

975
01:14:32,495 --> 01:14:35,487
- I think I know someone who can help.
- Who?

976
01:14:35,598 --> 01:14:36,724
Robo-Warrior.

977
01:14:40,370 --> 01:14:41,530
This guy, Robo-Warrior,

978
01:14:41,638 --> 01:14:43,970
everything about anything alien,
he's supposed to know.

979
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:45,471
One time we revenge-hacked his site

980
01:14:45,575 --> 01:14:49,944
and maybe I saw some
of your alien drawings or whatever.

981
01:15:02,525 --> 01:15:04,356
This is it. Yep.

982
01:15:04,461 --> 01:15:05,587
Deli. Good front!

983
01:15:06,062 --> 01:15:08,496
All right, wait here.
I'll give you the go/no go. All right?

984
01:15:09,065 --> 01:15:11,693
Number 42, we got your kishka, knish,

985
01:15:11,801 --> 01:15:14,895
kasha-varnishka
and kreplach combo right here.

986
01:15:15,004 --> 01:15:16,335
Cash only. Who's next?

987
01:15:16,439 --> 01:15:19,704
I told you to cure the lox in the brine
and then smoke it.

988
01:15:19,809 --> 01:15:21,367
Ma, you want me
to cut my hand off, or what?

989
01:15:21,478 --> 01:15:22,968
You... You ruined
a beautiful piece of fish, you retard!

990
01:15:23,079 --> 01:15:24,376
I'm like a ninja with a blade.
It's an art form.

991
01:15:24,481 --> 01:15:25,675
Give me your money. Get out of here!

992
01:15:25,782 --> 01:15:29,650
Hey, Sal! Watch your reach, huh?
Take a number, young man.

993
01:15:30,286 --> 01:15:31,651
Robo-Warrior.

994
01:15:33,389 --> 01:15:35,550
- Know him?
- I never heard of him.

995
01:15:35,658 --> 01:15:37,990
You never heard of
TheRealEffingDeal. Com?

996
01:15:38,094 --> 01:15:40,585
You must be talking about that
amateur-hour blog operation

997
01:15:40,697 --> 01:15:43,791
- with Game Boy-level security.
- Robo-Warrior.

998
01:15:44,968 --> 01:15:47,766
It's him! It's him!
That's the guy right there! That's him!

999
01:15:49,038 --> 01:15:50,266
No.

1000
01:15:50,974 --> 01:15:53,169
- You got to be kidding me.
- All right, meat store's closed!

1001
01:15:53,276 --> 01:15:55,608
- Everybody out! Out, right now!
- When he says to go,

1002
01:15:55,712 --> 01:15:57,270
- you go.
- That means you, lady, right now.

1003
01:15:57,380 --> 01:15:59,507
- Wait a minute. You know this guy?
- We're old friends.

1004
01:15:59,616 --> 01:16:03,052
Old friends? You're the case
that shut down Sector Seven,

1005
01:16:03,152 --> 01:16:04,449
got the kibosh, disbanded.

1006
01:16:04,554 --> 01:16:07,785
No more security clearance,
no retirement, no nothing.

1007
01:16:07,891 --> 01:16:10,826
All 'cause of you
and your little criminal girlfriend.

1008
01:16:10,927 --> 01:16:15,227
- Look at her now, so mature.
- Moron! Where's the whitefish?

1009
01:16:15,331 --> 01:16:17,162
Hey! Don't touch me with the pig.

1010
01:16:17,267 --> 01:16:18,825
- Yakov!
- What?

1011
01:16:18,935 --> 01:16:20,960
You don't get
Christmas bonuses standing around!

1012
01:16:21,070 --> 01:16:22,867
You want those new teeth
you saw on SkyMall?

1013
01:16:22,972 --> 01:16:25,133
- It's my dream.
- Help her out.

1014
01:16:25,808 --> 01:16:26,797
You live with your mama?

1015
01:16:26,910 --> 01:16:28,241
No, my mama lives with me.
It's a big difference.

1016
01:16:28,344 --> 01:16:30,175
They got your face all over the news,
alien boy.

1017
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:32,646
- Yeah, I know.
- And NBE One's still kicking, huh?

1018
01:16:32,749 --> 01:16:34,910
How did that happen? Don't answer.

1019
01:16:35,018 --> 01:16:37,384
I don't know what you're hiding,
but I don't want anything to do with it.

1020
01:16:37,487 --> 01:16:40,183
So, good-bye. You never saw me.
I got bagels to schmear. Vanish.

1021
01:16:40,290 --> 01:16:42,758
Can you give me five seconds?
Look, hold on, I need your help.

1022
01:16:42,859 --> 01:16:45,419
Really? You need my help?

1023
01:16:45,528 --> 01:16:48,122
I need...
Look, I am slowly losing my mind.

1024
01:16:48,231 --> 01:16:49,823
Okay, I had a little crab-bot,

1025
01:16:49,933 --> 01:16:52,026
plunged a device deep into
the soft tissues of my brain

1026
01:16:52,135 --> 01:16:54,968
and started projecting little alien
symbols like a freaking home movie!

1027
01:16:55,071 --> 01:16:57,801
And on top of that, I'm a wanted fugitive.
So, you think you got it rough?

1028
01:16:57,907 --> 01:17:00,068
You said it projected images
off your brain?

1029
01:17:00,176 --> 01:17:02,701
- Right.
- Meat locker, now!

1030
01:17:03,479 --> 01:17:04,707
Dead pigs.

1031
01:17:04,814 --> 01:17:06,941
What you're about to see is top secret.

1032
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:09,741
Do not tell my mother.

1033
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:12,888
- Swine flu. Not good.
- Now you know.

1034
01:17:12,989 --> 01:17:15,958
Next time you eat a goat or a pig,
there's a story behind it.

1035
01:17:16,059 --> 01:17:17,321
Sad little story.

1036
01:17:17,427 --> 01:17:18,587
An entire city flat.
How do you explain that?

1037
01:17:18,695 --> 01:17:19,719
Are you saying you believe
in aliens now?

1038
01:17:19,829 --> 01:17:22,957
Okay, files, files.
We're talking about symbols.

1039
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:26,260
Hey, still radioactive. Hands off.

1040
01:17:27,103 --> 01:17:28,968
Okay, Cube-brain.

1041
01:17:29,639 --> 01:17:31,834
Any of these look
like the symbols you saw?

1042
01:17:31,941 --> 01:17:33,272
Where'd you get these?

1043
01:17:33,376 --> 01:17:37,005
Before I got fired,
I poached S-7's crown jewel,

1044
01:17:37,113 --> 01:17:42,483
over 75 years of alien research,
which points to one inescapable fact.

1045
01:17:42,585 --> 01:17:46,487
The Transformers,
they've been here a long, long time.

1046
01:17:46,923 --> 01:17:48,015
How do I know?

1047
01:17:49,225 --> 01:17:51,022
Archeologists found
these unexplained markings

1048
01:17:51,127 --> 01:17:53,322
in ancient ruins all over the world.

1049
01:17:53,796 --> 01:17:55,821
China. Egypt. Greece.

1050
01:17:56,833 --> 01:17:58,391
Shot in 1932.

1051
01:17:58,501 --> 01:18:00,332
These the symbols
you're seeing in your head?

1052
01:18:00,436 --> 01:18:02,996
- Yeah.
- Same ones over here, right?

1053
01:18:03,106 --> 01:18:07,839
So, tell me, how did they end up
all drawing the same things?

1054
01:18:08,911 --> 01:18:11,880
Aliens. And I think some of them stayed.

1055
01:18:11,981 --> 01:18:14,882
Check this out. Project Black Knife.

1056
01:18:15,385 --> 01:18:19,845
Robots in disguise,
hiding here all along.

1057
01:18:19,956 --> 01:18:23,221
We detected radioactive signatures
all across the country.

1058
01:18:23,326 --> 01:18:26,818
I pleaded on my knees with S-7
to investigate it,

1059
01:18:26,929 --> 01:18:30,421
but they said the readings
were infinitesimal,

1060
01:18:30,533 --> 01:18:32,967
that I was obsessed.

1061
01:18:33,069 --> 01:18:34,832
Me. Can you imagine that?

1062
01:18:34,937 --> 01:18:38,031
Yeah. Megatron said that there
was another Energon source here.

1063
01:18:38,141 --> 01:18:39,972
- On Earth. Another source?
- On Earth.

1064
01:18:40,076 --> 01:18:42,943
Okay? And that these symbols,
maps in my head, would lead him there.

1065
01:18:43,046 --> 01:18:44,775
You talk to your Autobot friends
about this?

1066
01:18:44,881 --> 01:18:46,178
No, no, no, the source is before them.

1067
01:18:46,282 --> 01:18:48,079
Whatever the Energon source is,
it predates them.

1068
01:18:48,184 --> 01:18:49,242
It's before them.

1069
01:18:49,352 --> 01:18:51,320
- So, it comes before them.
- Correct.

1070
01:18:51,421 --> 01:18:54,788
Well, then we're porked,
unless we can talk to a Decepticon.

1071
01:18:55,158 --> 01:18:56,955
I mean,
I'm not on speaking terms with them.

1072
01:18:57,060 --> 01:18:58,721
Actually, I am.

1073
01:19:03,466 --> 01:19:04,797
Let me out!

1074
01:19:04,901 --> 01:19:07,131
- This is going to be a little bit sad.
- Open it.

1075
01:19:08,771 --> 01:19:10,966
I will have so many Decepticons
on your butt!

1076
01:19:11,074 --> 01:19:12,541
Hey, behave!

1077
01:19:12,642 --> 01:19:14,439
- What is it, a Decepticon?
- Yeah.

1078
01:19:14,544 --> 01:19:16,307
- And you're training him?
- I'm trying to.

1079
01:19:17,013 --> 01:19:19,880
I spent my whole adult life combing
the planet for aliens,

1080
01:19:20,216 --> 01:19:23,310
and you're carrying around one
in your purse like a little Chihuahua.

1081
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:26,354
Do you want a throwdown,
you pubic 'fro-head?

1082
01:19:26,456 --> 01:19:29,619
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry about your eye, you know,

1083
01:19:29,726 --> 01:19:32,820
but, if you're a good boy,
then I'm not gonna torch your other eye.

1084
01:19:32,929 --> 01:19:34,328
Okay? I'm not gonna torch it.

1085
01:19:34,430 --> 01:19:37,797
Just tell me
what these symbols are, please.

1086
01:19:38,968 --> 01:19:39,935
All right.

1087
01:19:41,738 --> 01:19:44,332
I know that.
That's the language of the Primes.

1088
01:19:45,274 --> 01:19:47,936
I don't read it, but these guys...

1089
01:19:48,044 --> 01:19:50,512
Where the frick did you find photos
of these guys?

1090
01:19:50,613 --> 01:19:54,379
- Is this they?
- Yeah. Seekers, pal. Oldest of the old.

1091
01:19:54,817 --> 01:19:58,048
They've been here thousands of years,
looking for something. I don't know what.

1092
01:19:58,154 --> 01:20:01,646
Nobody tells me nothing, but they'll
translate those symbols for you.

1093
01:20:01,758 --> 01:20:04,056
- And I know where to find them.
- Show us.

1094
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:05,457
Yeah.

1095
01:20:09,165 --> 01:20:11,156
The closest one's in Washington.

1096
01:20:13,536 --> 01:20:18,496
Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.
Land of dreams in there.

1097
01:20:19,375 --> 01:20:21,240
All I ever wanted to be was an astronaut.

1098
01:20:23,246 --> 01:20:25,271
- Hold those.
- What is that?

1099
01:20:26,215 --> 01:20:28,308
What? I wear them when I'm in a funk.

1100
01:20:29,352 --> 01:20:32,879
So does Giambi, Jeter.
It's a baseball thing. Okay.

1101
01:20:32,989 --> 01:20:35,355
Watches synchronized,
sharp mind and empty bladder.

1102
01:20:35,458 --> 01:20:38,427
You get caught, demand an attorney
and don't ever say my name.

1103
01:20:38,528 --> 01:20:40,257
Okay, take one of these pills.
Slip it under your tongue.

1104
01:20:40,363 --> 01:20:42,661
It's the high-concentrate polymer
they put in Oreo cookies.

1105
01:20:42,765 --> 01:20:44,426
Tricks the polygraph every time.

1106
01:20:44,534 --> 01:20:46,263
Okay. Now, let's get this show
on the road.

1107
01:20:47,270 --> 01:20:48,828
No, listen, I can't do this.

1108
01:20:48,938 --> 01:20:50,838
I'm not some alien bounty hunter, guys.
I'm not gonna do this.

1109
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:53,465
- Guards have guns. I don't want to die.
- Kid, kid, kid.

1110
01:20:53,576 --> 01:20:56,477
You compromise this mission,
you are dead to me.

1111
01:20:56,579 --> 01:20:59,104
Now look into my eyes
and tighten up that sphincter.

1112
01:21:00,283 --> 01:21:01,443
The museum is now closing.

1113
01:21:01,551 --> 01:21:04,452
Yo, baba! Bad news, bro!
Ran out of toilet paper!

1114
01:21:04,554 --> 01:21:05,851
You got any out here?
Please tell me you do.

1115
01:21:05,955 --> 01:21:08,890
Sir! I suggest you get in there.
The museum is closed!

1116
01:21:09,025 --> 01:21:11,425
Listen, man, I understand that,
but as you can see, this is important.

1117
01:21:11,527 --> 01:21:13,427
All right? Thumper dumper.
I got to go. All right.

1118
01:21:13,529 --> 01:21:16,430
Sir, you are a grown,
naked man around children.

1119
01:21:16,532 --> 01:21:19,433
- Pull your pants up and exit the building.
- I'm not going anywhere.

1120
01:21:24,006 --> 01:21:26,804
- You got that paper, right, sir?
- You should be embarrassed.

1121
01:21:26,909 --> 01:21:29,002
This is a family museum, sir.

1122
01:21:47,029 --> 01:21:48,519
What is going on here?

1123
01:21:48,631 --> 01:21:53,091
How many times can you get tased
in the nuts before you can't have kids?

1124
01:21:53,202 --> 01:21:55,363
You are an amateur, man,
a rank amateur.

1125
01:21:59,308 --> 01:22:01,469
We just downed five guards.
Five guards.

1126
01:22:01,577 --> 01:22:03,238
- Get your stuff and get out of here.
- Give me a second here.

1127
01:22:03,346 --> 01:22:05,007
I got to get the tracker, all right.

1128
01:22:05,114 --> 01:22:07,514
- Be good.
- I'm claustrophobic.

1129
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:27,733
Look, look. Follow him. Follow him.
He knows where he's going.

1130
01:22:33,476 --> 01:22:34,636
- He knows something.
- What?

1131
01:22:34,744 --> 01:22:35,733
He knows something.

1132
01:22:41,784 --> 01:22:42,751
You got what I got?

1133
01:22:42,852 --> 01:22:44,444
- Yeah.
- Blackbird.

1134
01:22:47,590 --> 01:22:49,057
There he is.

1135
01:22:49,158 --> 01:22:52,787
This guy's a legend,
like the Chairman of the Board!

1136
01:22:52,895 --> 01:22:57,059
Yo, freshman, point the shard
and watch the magic happen.

1137
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:06,203
Shit. It's a Decepticon!

1138
01:23:06,542 --> 01:23:08,635
- Decepticon?
- Decepticon?

1139
01:23:08,978 --> 01:23:10,775
Behind the MiG now!

1140
01:23:23,125 --> 01:23:26,094
What sort of hideous
mausoleum is this?

1141
01:23:27,229 --> 01:23:29,459
Answer me, pawns and knaves!

1142
01:23:29,565 --> 01:23:32,864
Show yourselves
or suffer my infinite wrath!

1143
01:23:34,103 --> 01:23:37,004
You little spinal-cord-based organisms!

1144
01:23:38,174 --> 01:23:39,402
Bugger it!

1145
01:23:39,942 --> 01:23:44,402
Behold the eternal glory of Jetfire!

1146
01:23:44,814 --> 01:23:46,873
Prepare for remote systems override!

1147
01:23:46,983 --> 01:23:49,508
- I tell you, this guy did not age well.
- I don't think he's gonna hurt us.

1148
01:23:49,618 --> 01:23:51,882
I command these doors to open.

1149
01:23:51,988 --> 01:23:55,924
Fire! I said, fire!

1150
01:23:56,826 --> 01:23:58,123
Bollocks!

1151
01:23:58,227 --> 01:24:01,797
- Damn these worthless parts.
- Wait a second!

1152
01:24:01,897 --> 01:24:05,196
Ltchy, wretched rust in my arse!

1153
01:24:06,168 --> 01:24:09,467
The museum is going to be very angry.
Very angry.

1154
01:24:09,572 --> 01:24:11,199
We gotta catch that plane.

1155
01:24:14,143 --> 01:24:18,580
- Right. I'm on a mission.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1156
01:24:18,681 --> 01:24:20,478
- What do you want?
- Look, we just want to talk!

1157
01:24:20,583 --> 01:24:22,346
I have no time to talk. I'm on a mission.

1158
01:24:22,451 --> 01:24:25,648
I'm a mercenary doom-bringer.
What planet am I on?

1159
01:24:25,755 --> 01:24:27,120
- Earth.
- Earth?

1160
01:24:27,223 --> 01:24:32,251
Terrible name for a planet.
Might as well call it "Dirt." Planet "Dirt."

1161
01:24:32,361 --> 01:24:35,762
Tell me,
is that robot civil war still going on?

1162
01:24:35,865 --> 01:24:37,492
- Who's winning?
- The Decepticons.

1163
01:24:38,634 --> 01:24:41,967
- Well, I changed sides to the Autobots.
- What do you mean, changed sides?

1164
01:24:42,071 --> 01:24:45,563
It's a choice.
It's an intensely personal decision.

1165
01:24:45,674 --> 01:24:49,303
So much negativity.
Who wants to live a life filled with hate?

1166
01:24:49,412 --> 01:24:50,401
You mean you don't have to work

1167
01:24:50,513 --> 01:24:52,174
for those miserable,
freaking Decepticons?

1168
01:24:52,281 --> 01:24:55,808
If Decepticons had their way,
they'd destroy the whole universe.

1169
01:24:56,118 --> 01:24:58,678
I'm changing sides. I'm changing sides,
too, warrior goddess.

1170
01:24:58,788 --> 01:25:00,949
- Who's your little Autobot?
- You're cute.

1171
01:25:01,057 --> 01:25:04,049
Name's Wheelie. Yeah.
Say my name, say my name.

1172
01:25:04,727 --> 01:25:06,388
What are you allowing
to happen to your foot just now?

1173
01:25:06,495 --> 01:25:07,587
At least he's faithful, Sam.

1174
01:25:07,696 --> 01:25:10,597
Yeah, well, he's faithful and he's nude
and he's perverted.

1175
01:25:12,234 --> 01:25:13,223
Can you just... Can you stop?

1176
01:25:13,335 --> 01:25:14,734
- Hey, what are you doing?
- It's just something

1177
01:25:14,837 --> 01:25:16,702
to think about. I won't argue with...
What were you saying?

1178
01:25:16,806 --> 01:25:20,867
I told you my name was Jetfire,
so stop judging me.

1179
01:25:20,976 --> 01:25:24,036
- Somebody shit the bed this morning.
- I have issues of my own.

1180
01:25:24,146 --> 01:25:25,636
And it started with my mother!

1181
01:25:25,748 --> 01:25:28,182
My ancestors
have been here for centuries.

1182
01:25:28,284 --> 01:25:31,219
My father, he was a wheel,
the first wheel.

1183
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:33,550
- Do you know what he transformed into?
- No.

1184
01:25:33,656 --> 01:25:34,680
Nothing!

1185
01:25:34,790 --> 01:25:38,419
But he did so with honor,
dignity, damn it!

1186
01:25:45,301 --> 01:25:46,268
Bollocks.

1187
01:25:46,702 --> 01:25:48,829
My boosters are fried.

1188
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:52,034
I think we can help each other.

1189
01:25:52,141 --> 01:25:55,008
You know things I don't know.
I know things you don't know, I do.

1190
01:25:55,111 --> 01:25:57,477
I don't think he knows anything.
Honestly, I don't.

1191
01:25:59,315 --> 01:26:01,613
I could do this all day.
It comes in waves, these vivid symbols.

1192
01:26:01,717 --> 01:26:04,652
They're symbols, but they're in my mind.
You see, all this is in my mind

1193
01:26:04,753 --> 01:26:06,584
and Megatron wants what's in my mind.

1194
01:26:06,689 --> 01:26:09,886
- Him and someone called the Fallen.
- The Fallen? I know him.

1195
01:26:09,992 --> 01:26:13,223
He left me here to rust.
The original Decepticon.

1196
01:26:13,329 --> 01:26:17,129
He's terrible to work for.
It's always apocalypse, chaos, crisis.

1197
01:26:17,233 --> 01:26:19,224
These transcriptions,
they were part of my mission,

1198
01:26:19,335 --> 01:26:20,302
the Fallen's search.

1199
01:26:20,402 --> 01:26:23,929
I remember now,
for the Dagger's Tip, and the key.

1200
01:26:24,039 --> 01:26:26,132
Slow down. The Dagger's Tip? The key?
What are you talking about?

1201
01:26:26,242 --> 01:26:30,679
No time to explain. Hold on, everybody!
Stay still or you'll die!

1202
01:26:57,306 --> 01:26:58,671
Well, that wasn't so bad.

1203
01:26:58,774 --> 01:27:00,401
I just hope we're still on the right planet.

1204
01:27:00,509 --> 01:27:02,443
Hey, that freaking hurt!

1205
01:27:03,746 --> 01:27:05,077
Oh, my God.

1206
01:27:12,121 --> 01:27:13,588
Oh, God.

1207
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:19,994
Oh, my God, what a beautiful face.

1208
01:27:20,095 --> 01:27:24,054
This would be a perfect moment,
except you landed on my testicles.

1209
01:27:24,166 --> 01:27:25,724
Please, get off.

1210
01:27:26,702 --> 01:27:29,136
God, my balls.

1211
01:27:30,372 --> 01:27:31,566
Sam!

1212
01:27:32,708 --> 01:27:35,802
- Where are we? Simmons!
- Hey! Yeah!

1213
01:27:36,111 --> 01:27:40,878
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
What is this? It's Vegas.

1214
01:27:40,983 --> 01:27:42,780
- You guys okay?
- Yeah.

1215
01:27:42,885 --> 01:27:45,353
Hey, I think we're in Vegas!

1216
01:27:45,454 --> 01:27:49,049
That really, really hurt.
You're just lucky that I didn't get hurt!

1217
01:27:49,158 --> 01:27:51,786
People could have gotten killed, okay?
And if I would have gotten hurt,

1218
01:27:51,894 --> 01:27:53,828
- you would have heard...
- Shut up.

1219
01:27:53,929 --> 01:27:58,195
I told you I was opening a space bridge.
It's the fastest way to travel to Egypt.

1220
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:01,133
When did you... When did you tell us?
You didn't tell us anything.

1221
01:28:01,237 --> 01:28:02,966
You didn't tell us anything.
Why are we in Egypt?

1222
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:07,634
Don't you get snippy with me, fleshling!
You were duly informed!

1223
01:28:07,743 --> 01:28:09,370
Can you just stop for a second?
Can you focus?

1224
01:28:09,478 --> 01:28:10,638
Can you tell us why we're in Egypt

1225
01:28:10,746 --> 01:28:13,374
so we can all have a little bit of
semblance of peace of mind?

1226
01:28:13,482 --> 01:28:16,918
This planet was visited
by our race once before,

1227
01:28:17,019 --> 01:28:19,749
by our earliest ancestors, millennia ago.

1228
01:28:19,855 --> 01:28:22,722
They were on an exploratory mission
to harvest Energon,

1229
01:28:22,825 --> 01:28:25,385
the lifeblood of our race.

1230
01:28:25,494 --> 01:28:30,329
Without it, we'll all perish, oxidize
and rust, like my wretched self!

1231
01:28:30,432 --> 01:28:34,334
Do you have any idea what it's like
to slowly fall apart and die?

1232
01:28:34,436 --> 01:28:37,337
Let's not get episodic, okay, old-timer?

1233
01:28:38,140 --> 01:28:43,339
Beginning, middle, end.
Facts. Details. Condense. Plot. Tell it.

1234
01:28:43,445 --> 01:28:48,280
Somewhere buried in this desert,
our ancestors built a great machine.

1235
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:52,548
It harvests Energon by destroying suns.

1236
01:28:52,655 --> 01:28:54,350
- Destroy suns?
- You mean blow them up?

1237
01:28:54,456 --> 01:28:56,321
Yes. You see, in the beginning,

1238
01:28:56,425 --> 01:28:59,519
there were seven Primes,
our original leaders.

1239
01:28:59,628 --> 01:29:03,689
And they set out into the universe,
seeking distant suns to harvest.

1240
01:29:04,366 --> 01:29:09,804
The Primes set out with one rule,
never destroy a planet with life,

1241
01:29:09,905 --> 01:29:12,806
until one of them tried to defy this rule.

1242
01:29:12,908 --> 01:29:17,106
And his name forevermore
was the Fallen.

1243
01:29:18,914 --> 01:29:21,212
He despised the human race

1244
01:29:22,451 --> 01:29:26,581
and he wanted to kill you all
by turning on that machine.

1245
01:29:26,689 --> 01:29:30,716
The only way to activate it
is with a legendary key

1246
01:29:30,826 --> 01:29:33,886
called the Matrix of Leadership.

1247
01:29:40,202 --> 01:29:44,571
A great battle took place over
possession of the Matrix.

1248
01:29:48,977 --> 01:29:51,844
The Fallen was stronger than
his brothers,

1249
01:29:53,282 --> 01:29:57,719
so they had no choice
but to steal and hide it from him.

1250
01:29:58,354 --> 01:30:03,189
In the ultimate sacrifice, they gave
their lives to seal the Matrix away

1251
01:30:03,292 --> 01:30:06,420
in a tomb made of
their very own bodies,

1252
01:30:07,196 --> 01:30:10,063
a tomb we cannot find.

1253
01:30:11,533 --> 01:30:17,199
Somewhere, buried in this desert,
that deadly machine remains.

1254
01:30:17,306 --> 01:30:19,331
The Fallen knows where it is

1255
01:30:19,441 --> 01:30:25,004
and if he finds the tomb of the Primes,
your world will be no more.

1256
01:30:25,447 --> 01:30:27,039
Okay, so how do we stop him?

1257
01:30:27,149 --> 01:30:29,515
Only a Prime can defeat the Fallen.

1258
01:30:29,618 --> 01:30:31,142
Optimus Prime?

1259
01:30:33,622 --> 01:30:35,715
So, you've met a Prime?

1260
01:30:35,824 --> 01:30:38,884
Why, you must have met
a great descendant.

1261
01:30:38,994 --> 01:30:42,054
Is he alive, here on this planet?

1262
01:30:42,831 --> 01:30:45,061
He sacrificed himself to save me.

1263
01:30:45,567 --> 01:30:47,034
So, he's dead.

1264
01:30:47,136 --> 01:30:51,197
Without a Prime, it's impossible.
No one else could stop the Fallen.

1265
01:30:51,306 --> 01:30:55,265
So, the same energy that's gonna be
used to reactivate the machine,

1266
01:30:55,377 --> 01:30:57,971
could that energy somehow be used
to reactivate Optimus

1267
01:30:58,080 --> 01:30:59,104
and bring him back to life?

1268
01:30:59,214 --> 01:31:03,878
It was never designed for that purpose,
but it's an energy like no other.

1269
01:31:04,219 --> 01:31:07,882
So, then how do you get us to the Matrix
before the Decepticons get to me?

1270
01:31:07,990 --> 01:31:11,153
Follow your mind, your map,
your symbols.

1271
01:31:11,260 --> 01:31:13,854
What you carved in the sand,
it's your clue.

1272
01:31:13,962 --> 01:31:19,161
When dawn alights the Dagger's Tip,
Three Kings will reveal the doorway!

1273
01:31:19,268 --> 01:31:21,202
Find the doorway!

1274
01:31:21,303 --> 01:31:23,168
Go now! Go!

1275
01:31:23,272 --> 01:31:26,173
That was my mission.
It's your mission now.

1276
01:31:26,275 --> 01:31:30,541
Go before the Decepticons find me
and find you.

1277
01:31:36,518 --> 01:31:38,418
Okay, here's what my CIA contact says.

1278
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:42,012
Ancient Sumerians used to call
the Gulf of Aqaba the "Dagger's Tip."

1279
01:31:42,124 --> 01:31:43,989
- That's the Dagger's Tip.
- It's part of the Red Sea.

1280
01:31:44,092 --> 01:31:46,253
It divides Egypt and Jordan
like the tip of a blade.

1281
01:31:46,361 --> 01:31:50,161
29.5 degrees north, 35 east. Here it is.

1282
01:31:50,666 --> 01:31:52,634
First thing we've got to do
is get Optimus to the Dagger's Tip.

1283
01:31:52,734 --> 01:31:55,168
How are you gonna get him
halfway around the world?

1284
01:31:55,270 --> 01:31:56,396
I'm gonna make a call.

1285
01:31:59,374 --> 01:32:00,602
We got cops!

1286
01:32:06,982 --> 01:32:07,971
I can't go to prison, guys.

1287
01:32:11,954 --> 01:32:14,514
Sam, we got to get off this road
and lay low.

1288
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:26,965
Man, stupid cops!

1289
01:32:27,069 --> 01:32:29,230
This is what's called
blending in like a ninja.

1290
01:32:29,338 --> 01:32:33,104
- Shut up or I'll blend my fist in your face.
- They're gone.

1291
01:32:33,208 --> 01:32:35,836
Okay, we're running out of time.
I gotta make the call to Lennox...

1292
01:32:35,944 --> 01:32:37,241
You're on the Worldwide Wanted List.

1293
01:32:37,346 --> 01:32:39,974
Try calling one base,
they'll track you here in seconds.

1294
01:32:40,082 --> 01:32:42,642
- CIA is all over this place!
- You're gonna call.

1295
01:32:48,223 --> 01:32:50,783
- Okay. That's a good idea.
- All right.

1296
01:32:50,893 --> 01:32:53,327
I mean, I just had my mind
on other things,

1297
01:32:53,428 --> 01:32:54,827
like winding up in an Egyptian prison.

1298
01:32:57,599 --> 01:32:59,897
NEST departure, 2100 hours.

1299
01:33:01,270 --> 01:33:05,001
So, we're shipping him back to base.
This is such a mistake.

1300
01:33:10,445 --> 01:33:12,606
Major Lennox, phone call.

1301
01:33:13,415 --> 01:33:16,475
Lennox, I'm with the kid. The kid. You
know, the one with the attitude, right?

1302
01:33:16,585 --> 01:33:18,143
We need the truck. The truck.

1303
01:33:18,253 --> 01:33:20,983
We got a possible resurrection
going on over here.

1304
01:33:21,089 --> 01:33:25,321
You're not gonna believe where we are.
Code Tut, as in King Tutankhamen.

1305
01:33:25,427 --> 01:33:26,951
Back of a $1 bill.

1306
01:33:27,429 --> 01:33:33,732
Coordinates for airdrop, 29.5 north,
34.88 east. Write it down. Write it.

1307
01:33:33,835 --> 01:33:36,497
Oh, my God. I got to go. Okay.
Heat comes.

1308
01:33:36,605 --> 01:33:38,129
Wait, who are you?

1309
01:33:39,408 --> 01:33:41,842
Wait. It's me. Leo. Me. Leo. Leo. Leo.

1310
01:33:41,944 --> 01:33:43,002
Cops are coming right now.
We need to go!

1311
01:33:43,111 --> 01:33:44,874
Move, move, move, move.

1312
01:33:46,048 --> 01:33:49,779
Coordinates, 29.5 north, 34.88 east.

1313
01:33:49,885 --> 01:33:52,319
Tip of the Red Sea.
Gulf of Aqaba.

1314
01:33:52,421 --> 01:33:54,912
Egypt? Are you serious?

1315
01:33:56,592 --> 01:33:57,650
Sir.

1316
01:34:01,964 --> 01:34:04,797
Even if we could figure out a way
to get big man over there,

1317
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:07,528
how is this little kid supposed
to bring him back to life?

1318
01:34:07,636 --> 01:34:10,969
Look, I don't know,
but we got to trust him.

1319
01:34:13,342 --> 01:34:14,639
Okay, let's go over it again.

1320
01:34:14,743 --> 01:34:16,904
When the dawn alights
the Dagger's Tip,

1321
01:34:17,012 --> 01:34:19,276
- the Three Kings...
- Will reveal the doorway.

1322
01:34:19,381 --> 01:34:21,144
That's what he said.
You know what it means?

1323
01:34:21,249 --> 01:34:22,773
- No, what does it mean?
- I have no idea.

1324
01:34:22,884 --> 01:34:24,647
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Checkpoint. Checkpoint.

1325
01:34:24,753 --> 01:34:26,152
I don't have my passport.

1326
01:34:28,557 --> 01:34:29,888
Passport!

1327
01:34:36,832 --> 01:34:38,823
They got cameras at the top.

1328
01:34:42,804 --> 01:34:46,240
All right, chill. This is espionage now.
I can handle it.

1329
01:34:46,341 --> 01:34:49,367
These are my people.
I'm one-thirty-sixth Arab.

1330
01:34:52,314 --> 01:34:53,804
Great, a fricking Munchkin.

1331
01:34:53,915 --> 01:34:56,315
Little people are mean.
Tell him he's tall.

1332
01:35:05,193 --> 01:35:08,026
The Dagger's Tip? Right?

1333
01:35:08,130 --> 01:35:10,598
Egypt, Jordan. We want to go there.

1334
01:35:10,699 --> 01:35:13,930
Me and my family. This is my family.
This is my son,

1335
01:35:14,036 --> 01:35:17,665
my other son, my daughter.
We're tourists, from New York.

1336
01:35:17,773 --> 01:35:19,638
- New York?
- Yes. Yes.

1337
01:35:19,741 --> 01:35:20,730
Fifty kilometers.

1338
01:35:20,842 --> 01:35:23,174
You look like the guy that runs
my falafel stand. Thank you very much.

1339
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:25,442
- I know. I know you from somewhere.
- Go, Yankees!

1340
01:35:26,014 --> 01:35:27,140
Put it on the wire to the CIA.

1341
01:35:31,553 --> 01:35:36,252
Decepticons, boy's location detected.

1342
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:48,201
Undercover, yo. You got to blend in
with your surroundings.

1343
01:35:48,303 --> 01:35:50,635
You know, you got to be part
of the landscape.

1344
01:35:58,747 --> 01:36:01,807
Awesome! I think aliens built that.

1345
01:36:02,551 --> 01:36:03,848
Yeah, yeah.

1346
01:36:03,952 --> 01:36:05,943
Come on. Move it! Move it!

1347
01:36:06,088 --> 01:36:08,147
Guard us. Low profile.
Don't make a scene, okay?

1348
01:36:08,256 --> 01:36:11,316
Yeah, some of us got work to do!
Dumb Autobots.

1349
01:36:32,948 --> 01:36:36,008
Being my girlfriend is hazardous
to your health.

1350
01:36:36,852 --> 01:36:40,948
Yeah, well, girls like dangerous boys.

1351
01:36:41,423 --> 01:36:42,981
- Do they?
- Yeah.

1352
01:36:45,827 --> 01:36:47,988
You might as well just say it.

1353
01:36:48,096 --> 01:36:49,529
Ladies first.

1354
01:36:50,999 --> 01:36:53,695
Okay, so tonight you're going to be
a gentleman.

1355
01:36:53,802 --> 01:36:56,896
- You're really chivalrous.
- Why are you mad at me?

1356
01:36:57,005 --> 01:37:00,463
You know what?
Baby, I'm not... I'm not mad.

1357
01:37:01,643 --> 01:37:06,103
Do you realize that I just flew 3,000
miles to keep you from getting killed?

1358
01:37:06,214 --> 01:37:07,374
I know.

1359
01:37:10,786 --> 01:37:13,380
Who else could be your girlfriend, Sam?

1360
01:37:13,488 --> 01:37:16,184
Look at the things I go through with you.

1361
01:37:16,825 --> 01:37:18,986
And now we're underneath the moon
and the stars

1362
01:37:19,094 --> 01:37:21,289
and the three most beautiful pyramids
on the planet

1363
01:37:21,396 --> 01:37:23,694
and you still can't even tell me that
you love me.

1364
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:26,131
Pyramids.

1365
01:37:27,369 --> 01:37:28,768
What? Why do boys always

1366
01:37:28,870 --> 01:37:30,838
- change the subject?
- Pyramids and stars.

1367
01:37:30,939 --> 01:37:32,372
- Sam?
- Come with me really quick.

1368
01:37:40,549 --> 01:37:42,608
Simmons! Leo! Wake up!

1369
01:37:45,954 --> 01:37:48,218
Listen, astronomy class, page 47.
Remember the class?

1370
01:37:48,323 --> 01:37:50,985
No. I was only in college for two days.
Remember that?

1371
01:37:51,092 --> 01:37:53,185
- Here. Get up. Up, up.
- What is he talking about?

1372
01:37:58,500 --> 01:37:59,660
Okay, you see those three stars?

1373
01:37:59,768 --> 01:38:01,463
You see
how the last one touches the horizon?

1374
01:38:01,636 --> 01:38:04,298
That's Orion's belt,
but it's also called the Three Kings.

1375
01:38:04,406 --> 01:38:06,203
And the reason for that
is the three Egyptian kings

1376
01:38:06,308 --> 01:38:09,072
who built the pyramids of Giza
built them to mirror those stars,

1377
01:38:09,177 --> 01:38:11,008
so it's like an arrow staring us
straight in the face.

1378
01:38:11,112 --> 01:38:14,513
They all point due east, towards Jordan.
The mountains of Petra.

1379
01:38:27,562 --> 01:38:28,824
We've had an engine malfunction.

1380
01:38:28,930 --> 01:38:30,898
We're gonna have to divert
to SOCCENT.

1381
01:38:30,999 --> 01:38:33,058
Flight master, let's lighten the load
and prepare for bailout.

1382
01:38:33,168 --> 01:38:35,602
Bailout? Bailout? Bailout? Bailout?

1383
01:38:35,704 --> 01:38:38,605
- All right, team, grab your chutes!
- Bailout like bailout?

1384
01:38:41,209 --> 01:38:43,643
- You familiar with the standard MC-4?
- Of course not!

1385
01:38:43,745 --> 01:38:46,009
I've never jumped out of
a perfectly good airplane before!

1386
01:38:46,114 --> 01:38:47,479
Wait a minute, is this really happening?

1387
01:38:47,582 --> 01:38:49,345
- Yeah.
- All right, here we go.

1388
01:38:50,352 --> 01:38:54,015
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You're behind this, aren't you?

1389
01:38:54,122 --> 01:38:55,749
What are you talking about?
You heard the pilot.

1390
01:38:55,857 --> 01:38:59,691
These guys don't mess around.
This is just standard procedure.

1391
01:38:59,794 --> 01:39:02,957
I'm just following orders to the letter.
Isn't that what you said?

1392
01:39:03,598 --> 01:39:06,658
You just signed a death warrant
on your career, Major.

1393
01:39:10,805 --> 01:39:12,864
What was that? What was that?

1394
01:39:12,974 --> 01:39:15,272
That's not good. Come on.

1395
01:39:16,311 --> 01:39:17,801
- Right this way!
- I can't jump out of an airplane!

1396
01:39:17,913 --> 01:39:19,904
- I have an ulcer! No, no.
- Come on. It's okay.

1397
01:39:20,348 --> 01:39:22,543
I really can't do this.
What are you doing...

1398
01:39:23,118 --> 01:39:25,143
Come here! Come here.

1399
01:39:25,253 --> 01:39:29,485
- Why aren't you wearing your chute?
- Because I have to secure the VIPs first.

1400
01:39:29,591 --> 01:39:33,789
Okay, I want you to listen very carefully
and memorize everything that I say.

1401
01:39:33,895 --> 01:39:36,830
Each chute has a GPS tracker so you
can be found by Search and Rescue.

1402
01:39:36,932 --> 01:39:39,025
Right next to that's a fabric webbing
called a bridle,

1403
01:39:39,134 --> 01:39:41,227
which holds the pin
that keeps the main container closed.

1404
01:39:41,336 --> 01:39:43,395
- Okay, are you listening?
- I can't hear what...

1405
01:39:43,505 --> 01:39:44,904
- Stop that!
- All right. All right.

1406
01:39:45,006 --> 01:39:47,474
All right,
when the pilot chute inflates into the air,

1407
01:39:47,575 --> 01:39:49,702
it pulls the pin
and opens the main.

1408
01:39:49,811 --> 01:39:51,836
Red's your backup, blue's your primary.

1409
01:39:51,947 --> 01:39:56,111
I want you to pull the blue.
I need you to pull it really hard!

1410
01:39:56,217 --> 01:39:58,981
Not now, we're on the plane,
you dumb-ass!

1411
01:40:01,957 --> 01:40:04,926
- He say good-bye?
- No, he didn't even say good-bye.

1412
01:40:05,393 --> 01:40:07,190
General, we're loaded and ready.

1413
01:40:07,295 --> 01:40:10,162
You give us the go, and we'll be ready
to press in five minutes.

1414
01:40:10,265 --> 01:40:13,063
- Excellent.
- Sir, you need to see this now.

1415
01:40:15,737 --> 01:40:17,762
- Have we checked these coordinates?
- Egypt, sir.

1416
01:40:17,872 --> 01:40:20,636
- They're airdropping in.
- You've got to be kidding me.

1417
01:40:20,742 --> 01:40:22,107
He knows something.

1418
01:40:22,210 --> 01:40:24,542
We need to be ready to back him up
if this thing goes hot.

1419
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:26,972
Copy that.

1420
01:40:27,082 --> 01:40:29,516
CIA just got a hit on the boy,

1421
01:40:30,118 --> 01:40:32,109
100 miles from the location
on that little note there.

1422
01:40:32,220 --> 01:40:33,278
It's getting hotter.

1423
01:40:37,792 --> 01:40:40,352
It's gotta be around here somewhere.

1424
01:41:01,683 --> 01:41:03,651
You see the size of this?

1425
01:41:04,386 --> 01:41:06,752
- You see this?
- Spectacular.

1426
01:41:08,490 --> 01:41:10,890
Amazing. Look at that.

1427
01:41:21,136 --> 01:41:23,468
- It's here somewhere, guys.
- Yeah, why?

1428
01:41:23,571 --> 01:41:25,095
'Cause we're trusting Grandpa Blackbird

1429
01:41:25,206 --> 01:41:26,673
who doesn't even know
what planet he's on?

1430
01:41:26,775 --> 01:41:30,734
In his defense, this is the biggest
doorway I've ever seen in my entire life.

1431
01:41:31,546 --> 01:41:35,038
Okay. Well, that's great.
Let me do a quick search, all right?

1432
01:41:35,150 --> 01:41:36,708
Nope. Ever cross your mind, guys,

1433
01:41:36,818 --> 01:41:38,217
that archeologists
have been here before?

1434
01:41:38,319 --> 01:41:39,220
There's nothing here.

1435
01:41:39,487 --> 01:41:41,853
Real life is heartbreak, despair, kid.

1436
01:41:41,956 --> 01:41:44,083
Sometimes you get to
the end of the rainbow

1437
01:41:44,192 --> 01:41:46,319
and the leprechauns went
and booby-trapped it!

1438
01:41:46,428 --> 01:41:48,760
I'm listening to you?
You live with your mother!

1439
01:41:49,964 --> 01:41:52,057
- It's not over.
- It is over. It's done.

1440
01:41:52,167 --> 01:41:53,657
Why are we still listening to you,
little punk-ass?

1441
01:41:53,768 --> 01:41:55,793
I mean, what you ever done for us
except ding my rim?

1442
01:41:55,904 --> 01:41:57,838
Killed Megatron. How about that?

1443
01:41:57,939 --> 01:41:58,963
Well, he didn't get the job done,

1444
01:41:59,074 --> 01:42:00,564
you know what I mean,
'cause he's back now...

1445
01:42:00,675 --> 01:42:03,610
- Are you scared?
- Scared? Scared of your ugly face!

1446
01:42:03,711 --> 01:42:06,077
I'm ugly?
Well, we're twins, you stupid genius!

1447
01:42:06,181 --> 01:42:07,944
Bring it, then! Get off me!

1448
01:42:08,049 --> 01:42:11,109
- I'll change your face around!
- I'll get all up in that ass!

1449
01:42:11,219 --> 01:42:12,584
Bring it!

1450
01:42:13,354 --> 01:42:14,514
Guys!

1451
01:42:15,857 --> 01:42:17,449
- You like the way that feels?
- That didn't hurt.

1452
01:42:17,559 --> 01:42:19,049
You like that, don't you?

1453
01:42:19,160 --> 01:42:21,526
- Come on, Bumblebee!
- Bumblebee, listen.

1454
01:42:28,203 --> 01:42:29,192
Now, that's rude.

1455
01:42:41,182 --> 01:42:43,116
Oh, my God. The symbols.

1456
01:42:44,419 --> 01:42:46,216
Bee! Shoot it.

1457
01:43:12,113 --> 01:43:14,707
- Check this out.
- Look at it.

1458
01:43:16,017 --> 01:43:16,984
Wow!

1459
01:43:17,118 --> 01:43:19,586
These are the bodies
Jetfire was talking about.

1460
01:43:20,155 --> 01:43:22,020
The tomb of the Primes.

1461
01:43:22,524 --> 01:43:23,752
Yo!

1462
01:43:25,093 --> 01:43:26,219
Yo!

1463
01:43:40,275 --> 01:43:41,606
The Matrix.

1464
01:43:59,194 --> 01:44:00,354
No.

1465
01:44:01,663 --> 01:44:02,721
No.

1466
01:44:05,133 --> 01:44:07,658
Thousands of years, turned to dust.

1467
01:44:08,303 --> 01:44:10,271
This isn't how it's supposed to end.

1468
01:44:10,371 --> 01:44:11,497
Hear that?

1469
01:44:16,077 --> 01:44:18,443
US Air Force! C-17 s!

1470
01:44:18,546 --> 01:44:21,208
- What's a C-17?
- You can't bring him back, Sam.

1471
01:44:21,316 --> 01:44:24,911
- There's nothing left.
- Look! Look around you.

1472
01:44:25,019 --> 01:44:27,544
We didn't just go through everything
we went through for no reason at all,

1473
01:44:27,655 --> 01:44:29,088
to just have it end like this.

1474
01:44:29,190 --> 01:44:30,817
There is a reason that we are here.

1475
01:44:30,925 --> 01:44:34,759
The voices and the symbols in my head
led us here for a purpose.

1476
01:44:40,702 --> 01:44:42,932
Everyone's after me
because of what I know,

1477
01:44:45,273 --> 01:44:48,436
and what I know is that
this is going to work.

1478
01:44:48,943 --> 01:44:51,935
- How do you know it's gonna work?
- Because I believe it.

1479
01:45:02,023 --> 01:45:04,355
You best let me out of this plane.

1480
01:45:14,936 --> 01:45:17,962
Dropping the big boy. Sam!

1481
01:45:25,146 --> 01:45:27,376
You think you can bring him back to life
with that pixie dust?

1482
01:45:27,482 --> 01:45:29,040
Absolutely. Let's go.

1483
01:45:39,160 --> 01:45:40,320
Go!

1484
01:45:41,195 --> 01:45:43,857
Let's move it.
Remember, they're friendlies.

1485
01:45:54,542 --> 01:45:56,032
Cover Optimus!

1486
01:45:59,047 --> 01:46:01,106
Secure the village.
Get those cases down here.

1487
01:46:01,215 --> 01:46:03,308
I need snipers and Stingers up high.

1488
01:46:03,418 --> 01:46:07,548
So, we just dropped off 10 tons of
dead robot in the middle of nowhere.

1489
01:46:07,655 --> 01:46:09,247
I hope this little kid know
what he's doing.

1490
01:46:09,357 --> 01:46:10,346
Yeah, me too.

1491
01:46:16,364 --> 01:46:19,527
Got a visual! Yellow team! Four clicks!

1492
01:46:22,870 --> 01:46:24,167
Pop flare!

1493
01:46:26,474 --> 01:46:29,034
- That's them, right there. See the flare?
- Right over there! See it?

1494
01:46:40,121 --> 01:46:41,281
Sam!

1495
01:46:53,634 --> 01:46:55,158
Oh, God. Please, God! Please.

1496
01:46:55,269 --> 01:46:56,896
Leo, stop freaking out. Stop freaking out.

1497
01:46:57,004 --> 01:46:58,403
Shut this guy up, huh?

1498
01:46:58,506 --> 01:47:00,872
- Please, just let me live, just let me live!
- Shut up and let him drive!

1499
01:47:00,975 --> 01:47:02,237
- Just stop screaming...
- All right, that's it!

1500
01:47:04,979 --> 01:47:06,412
I can't take that guy anymore.

1501
01:47:19,727 --> 01:47:21,752
Hide in the dust! Use the dust!

1502
01:47:29,404 --> 01:47:31,338
We've got to split up.
Bumblebee, you're the decoy.

1503
01:47:31,439 --> 01:47:34,067
You lead the Decepticons away,
all right? I'm gonna get Optimus.

1504
01:47:34,175 --> 01:47:36,700
I'll help draw their fire
with Huey and Dewey there.

1505
01:47:36,811 --> 01:47:38,802
You get to those soldiers.

1506
01:47:39,981 --> 01:47:42,973
- I hope that dust works, kid.
- Thank you.

1507
01:47:46,821 --> 01:47:50,257
He's turning around. He's coming back.
He's coming back.

1508
01:47:51,025 --> 01:47:52,049
It's up to me.

1509
01:47:52,393 --> 01:47:55,021
One man, alone,
betrayed by the country he loves,

1510
01:47:55,129 --> 01:47:57,597
now its last hope
in their final hour of need.

1511
01:47:57,698 --> 01:48:01,361
Prepare to be driven like never before,
by the maestro.

1512
01:48:01,469 --> 01:48:04,438
- Hey, hey! Don't go nowhere! Drive.
- You'll never make it, kid.

1513
01:48:04,539 --> 01:48:07,007
- I'm coming with you.
- Bravery will only get you so far.

1514
01:48:07,108 --> 01:48:10,009
You tased me, okay? You owe me!
I'm going.

1515
01:48:10,111 --> 01:48:11,874
Okay, okay. That was a test.
You passed. All right?

1516
01:48:20,188 --> 01:48:23,589
That thing's got alien tattoos all over it.
That ain't Air Force.

1517
01:48:27,695 --> 01:48:29,856
- What the hell was that?
- Anyone copy?

1518
01:48:29,964 --> 01:48:31,989
- Anyone there? Who's up?
- Copy?

1519
01:48:32,099 --> 01:48:34,363
- Radio's down.
- It's dead. Comms are down.

1520
01:48:34,469 --> 01:48:35,766
EMP burst.

1521
01:48:36,170 --> 01:48:39,003
I see how this day is going
in this godforsaken desert.

1522
01:48:40,808 --> 01:48:41,832
Yes, sir?

1523
01:48:41,943 --> 01:48:44,741
- Major Lennox told me to pull the cord.
- I know, sir.

1524
01:48:44,846 --> 01:48:47,644
Well, what country am I in right now?

1525
01:48:47,748 --> 01:48:49,010
United States.

1526
01:48:49,116 --> 01:48:52,984
No, not the United States.
I'm from the United States.

1527
01:48:53,087 --> 01:48:55,749
I'm in the middle of nowhere
surrounded by donkeys.

1528
01:48:55,857 --> 01:49:00,692
Well, that was our good friend,
Galloway. He's less than pleased.

1529
01:49:00,795 --> 01:49:03,423
How is it that we can't reach our men,

1530
01:49:03,531 --> 01:49:08,867
but he can reach me,
from some random Egyptian desert?

1531
01:49:12,907 --> 01:49:14,135
Nothing.

1532
01:49:14,742 --> 01:49:17,609
Right, go burn an SOS. Let the eye in
the sky know we need some help.

1533
01:49:17,712 --> 01:49:19,680
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, boys, old school time!

1534
01:49:20,114 --> 01:49:22,446
Pop some more flares
so the kid can find us.

1535
01:49:28,222 --> 01:49:31,658
Look. There it is.
We got a couple of miles.

1536
01:49:32,360 --> 01:49:37,161
Lennox's team has the latest
in quantum crypto gear.

1537
01:49:37,265 --> 01:49:42,635
Can somebody tell me why we can't
establish simple radio contact?

1538
01:49:42,737 --> 01:49:45,365
We're hailing them on every frequency
and mode in the book, sir.

1539
01:49:45,473 --> 01:49:47,839
Our satellites in the area have
gone blind. We're working it, sir.

1540
01:49:47,942 --> 01:49:51,537
Damn it. Something's not right.
It doesn't add up.

1541
01:49:51,646 --> 01:49:55,082
Contact the Jordanians, see
what air assets they've got in the area,

1542
01:49:55,182 --> 01:49:57,514
and get Egypt's General Salam.

1543
01:49:57,618 --> 01:50:01,486
Ask him to clear some USV overflights
in Egyptian airspace.

1544
01:50:01,589 --> 01:50:04,615
We need an assist
in confirming visuals now.

1545
01:50:04,926 --> 01:50:06,450
Scramble Predators now.

1546
01:50:06,694 --> 01:50:08,059
V-1, rotate.

1547
01:50:20,141 --> 01:50:21,938
We still have a mile that way.

1548
01:50:27,648 --> 01:50:28,979
Come on.

1549
01:50:32,119 --> 01:50:33,677
This way. This way.

1550
01:50:38,326 --> 01:50:41,659
- One man, alone...
- Stop saying that!

1551
01:50:41,762 --> 01:50:42,990
...betrayed by the country he loves!

1552
01:50:43,097 --> 01:50:45,258
Oh, my goodness.
I'm in the car, okay? You're not alone.

1553
01:50:45,967 --> 01:50:48,435
Just relax. You're with the maestro.

1554
01:50:57,144 --> 01:50:58,813
I don't think he's still following us.

1555
01:50:58,813 --> 01:50:59,142
I don't think he's still following us.

1556
01:51:00,181 --> 01:51:01,808
That's what you think.

1557
01:51:18,699 --> 01:51:22,430
Master, sorry to be the bearer
of bad news,

1558
01:51:22,536 --> 01:51:25,562
but the soldiers brought
the body of Prime.

1559
01:51:25,673 --> 01:51:27,834
The boy must have the Matrix.

1560
01:51:28,309 --> 01:51:30,869
We cannot let him reach Optimus.

1561
01:51:31,579 --> 01:51:35,208
Decepticons, begin our assault!

1562
01:51:35,983 --> 01:51:37,541
We've got incoming!

1563
01:51:53,734 --> 01:51:56,635
We got a whole lot of fight
coming our way.

1564
01:51:56,737 --> 01:51:58,728
- How many?
- About 13 of them.

1565
01:51:58,839 --> 01:52:01,467
This ain't good. This ain't good.

1566
01:52:09,717 --> 01:52:11,878
We're about to get our asses whupped.

1567
01:52:13,054 --> 01:52:14,817
Bravo-Charlie, kneel!

1568
01:52:14,922 --> 01:52:17,789
All right, those Decepticons
are searching for Sam.

1569
01:52:19,193 --> 01:52:22,094
Whatever he has, he thinks
it'll bring Optimus back to life,

1570
01:52:22,196 --> 01:52:25,029
so our mission is to find him
and get him to Optimus.

1571
01:52:25,132 --> 01:52:27,930
All right, we're gonna draw fire
from the left flank. I need a scout team.

1572
01:52:28,035 --> 01:52:29,059
I'm leading.

1573
01:52:29,170 --> 01:52:31,570
Go up through the middle
with Arcee and Ironhide!

1574
01:52:31,672 --> 01:52:33,162
All right, when you see
the precious cargo,

1575
01:52:33,274 --> 01:52:36,004
I want you to pop green smoke and
come back through those pillars.

1576
01:52:36,110 --> 01:52:39,273
We'll have the ambush set. All right.
Let's go. Move out!

1577
01:52:48,556 --> 01:52:50,820
You ever see that film
Gunfight at the O.K. Corral?

1578
01:52:52,326 --> 01:52:55,489
- With Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas?
- No, why?

1579
01:52:58,766 --> 01:53:01,564
- Looks like we're right in the middle of it.
- Is that good?

1580
01:53:03,804 --> 01:53:05,328
A lot of people died.

1581
01:53:23,591 --> 01:53:24,717
Hide!

1582
01:53:26,193 --> 01:53:28,252
- V¨¢monos, amigos!
- Oh, my God!

1583
01:53:32,700 --> 01:53:34,167
- Hit the deck!
- Oh, my God!

1584
01:53:50,317 --> 01:53:51,341
Sam, Sam.

1585
01:53:52,486 --> 01:53:54,477
I don't think they saw us.

1586
01:53:55,055 --> 01:53:56,886
Get down. Get down. Get down.

1587
01:53:57,291 --> 01:53:58,815
Okay. Listen.

1588
01:54:00,728 --> 01:54:04,061
Once it's clear, we run for Optimus
as fast as we can, okay?

1589
01:54:05,399 --> 01:54:06,866
What if it doesn't work?

1590
01:54:07,735 --> 01:54:09,293
It's gonna work.

1591
01:54:09,403 --> 01:54:12,372
- What if it doesn't?
- It's gonna work. It'll work.

1592
01:55:48,836 --> 01:55:50,269
Up, up, up!

1593
01:56:00,281 --> 01:56:01,908
Get ready to jump!

1594
01:56:20,801 --> 01:56:23,429
We got a half-mile. I don't think
the soldiers know we're here.

1595
01:56:26,173 --> 01:56:26,974
Fall back!

1596
01:56:26,974 --> 01:56:27,463
Fall back!

1597
01:56:27,608 --> 01:56:31,009
- Ironhide, up the middle!
- Ironhide, move it!

1598
01:56:31,111 --> 01:56:33,079
Let's go! Go, go!

1599
01:56:40,321 --> 01:56:41,652
Devastator!

1600
01:56:44,158 --> 01:56:46,058
We're trapped! There's nowhere to go.
We're gonna die.

1601
01:56:46,160 --> 01:56:48,355
If we're going out, we're going out
like men, understand?

1602
01:57:19,193 --> 01:57:21,024
Look at this mother...

1603
01:57:21,128 --> 01:57:22,720
Mean robots suck!

1604
01:57:33,407 --> 01:57:35,967
Hang on! Hang on, okay?

1605
01:57:41,048 --> 01:57:42,913
- Simmons!
- Don't let go!

1606
01:57:43,017 --> 01:57:45,451
Hang in there, I got you! Just hang in.

1607
01:57:49,490 --> 01:57:50,957
I don't want to die!

1608
01:57:52,893 --> 01:57:54,758
Kung fu grip, boy. Kung fu grip!

1609
01:57:54,862 --> 01:57:56,056
You ain't getting me!

1610
01:58:00,534 --> 01:58:02,764
He dead. He got so ate.

1611
01:58:03,170 --> 01:58:06,071
- Who's your daddy now, huh?
- He got all ate up.

1612
01:58:06,173 --> 01:58:08,266
The only safe place is right under it.

1613
01:58:08,375 --> 01:58:12,004
- Run at it. Run for its feet! Move it!
- Yeah.

1614
01:58:18,919 --> 01:58:22,218
You should've never eaten me!
I'm gonna bust your face up!

1615
01:58:27,261 --> 01:58:28,387
Oh, my God!

1616
01:58:31,165 --> 01:58:33,633
Nobody mess with me! In your face!

1617
01:58:34,601 --> 01:58:36,228
Keep fighting, Mudflap!

1618
01:58:37,171 --> 01:58:38,502
Oh, my God!

1619
01:58:44,912 --> 01:58:46,846
Nobody messes with the twins.

1620
01:58:49,883 --> 01:58:52,044
I got you... My bad!

1621
01:58:54,822 --> 01:58:56,847
Man! You shot me in the face!

1622
01:58:57,324 --> 01:58:59,588
- Stay under it!
- Yeah, stay under it!

1623
01:59:03,597 --> 01:59:04,859
Come on.

1624
01:59:20,881 --> 01:59:22,041
Judy!

1625
01:59:27,154 --> 01:59:29,213
- Sam! Sam!
- What?

1626
01:59:30,257 --> 01:59:32,157
Sam! Sam!

1627
01:59:36,663 --> 01:59:37,891
Sam!

1628
01:59:37,998 --> 01:59:39,295
- Sam!
- Dad!

1629
01:59:47,074 --> 01:59:48,439
Wait, wait!

1630
01:59:49,710 --> 01:59:53,202
Please listen to me!
I want you to run! Run!

1631
01:59:53,313 --> 01:59:56,009
Dad, just stop!
They don't want you, they want me!

1632
01:59:56,116 --> 01:59:57,549
- Oh, God!
- Wait!

1633
01:59:57,651 --> 01:59:59,516
Sam Witwicky.

1634
01:59:59,620 --> 02:00:03,886
Don't hurt them. This is what you want.
You don't want them.

1635
02:00:03,991 --> 02:00:05,618
- Go! Go!
- Please, stop!

1636
02:00:05,726 --> 02:00:06,886
- Stop!
- Listen to your father!

1637
02:00:06,994 --> 02:00:08,757
Just get out of here!

1638
02:00:09,129 --> 02:00:11,461
Just don't hurt them.
I know what you want.

1639
02:00:11,565 --> 02:00:13,055
Just go! Just go!

1640
02:00:13,167 --> 02:00:16,933
And I know that you need me
because I know about the Matrix.

1641
02:00:17,571 --> 02:00:19,095
- Don't do it, Sam...
- Please, Dad.

1642
02:00:19,206 --> 02:00:23,142
- They're going to kill us all anyway!
- Here's what you want, right here.

1643
02:00:23,544 --> 02:00:24,943
Bumblebee!

1644
02:00:38,192 --> 02:00:39,784
Kill him, Bee. Kill him.

1645
02:01:17,764 --> 02:01:20,289
- Stay tight, Ma.
- Come on. Get in here.

1646
02:01:34,248 --> 02:01:35,977
- Bee?
- Yeah.

1647
02:01:39,553 --> 02:01:40,611
- Hey!
- I don't know

1648
02:01:40,721 --> 02:01:42,621
what's going on, but we've got to move!

1649
02:01:46,827 --> 02:01:48,658
There's got to be a way out of here!

1650
02:01:50,030 --> 02:01:52,055
Judy, get back, get back, get back.

1651
02:01:53,300 --> 02:01:56,269
Against the wall! Against the wall!
Against the wall. Against the wall.

1652
02:01:57,671 --> 02:01:59,639
Bee! Bumblebee!

1653
02:02:00,540 --> 02:02:02,474
You get them somewhere safe,
all right?

1654
02:02:04,878 --> 02:02:06,004
You've got to get in the car
and get to safety.

1655
02:02:06,113 --> 02:02:07,944
No, this isn't up for discussion!

1656
02:02:08,048 --> 02:02:09,913
- You're my son! You're my son!
- I know.

1657
02:02:10,017 --> 02:02:11,245
- Dad...
- We all go together!

1658
02:02:11,351 --> 02:02:12,648
- Listen...
- We're all going together!

1659
02:02:12,753 --> 02:02:16,018
Dad, stop, okay? Get in the car.
He's gonna get you to safety.

1660
02:02:16,123 --> 02:02:18,353
You know, you run.
You don't stop, you don't hide, you run.

1661
02:02:18,458 --> 02:02:21,018
You hear what I'm saying, okay?
I'll find you when you're safe.

1662
02:02:21,128 --> 02:02:22,595
- No.
- You've got to let me go, Dad.

1663
02:02:22,696 --> 02:02:25,995
- You have to let me go. You have to.
- Ron.

1664
02:02:28,735 --> 02:02:31,135
Ron. Ron, let him go.

1665
02:02:33,206 --> 02:02:35,538
You come back! Come on.

1666
02:02:35,676 --> 02:02:37,405
Ron! Mikaela! Mikaela!

1667
02:02:37,511 --> 02:02:40,002
- Go with my parents.
- I'm not gonna go without you.

1668
02:02:51,358 --> 02:02:52,882
Move to cover!

1669
02:02:57,164 --> 02:02:58,893
We got Jordanians!

1670
02:02:58,999 --> 02:03:00,432
We got help!

1671
02:03:06,573 --> 02:03:07,801
Down!

1672
02:03:24,391 --> 02:03:26,018
You okay, soldier?

1673
02:03:26,126 --> 02:03:29,254
We're gonna help you, soldier. Let's
get these wounded clear of the bird.

1674
02:03:29,363 --> 02:03:31,263
Stay still. Stay still. Don't move.

1675
02:03:31,365 --> 02:03:33,629
You all right, young man?
You have a radio?

1676
02:03:35,102 --> 02:03:39,539
Hey, kid, it's been nice knowing you.
Remember what I did for my country.

1677
02:03:41,074 --> 02:03:42,701
This is my moment.

1678
02:03:43,510 --> 02:03:44,534
You're crazy!

1679
02:03:46,680 --> 02:03:48,511
ETA to station, two minutes.

1680
02:03:48,615 --> 02:03:50,480
- Put it on the main screen.
- Sir. Yes, sir.

1681
02:03:50,584 --> 02:03:51,949
Predator 01.

1682
02:04:02,462 --> 02:04:03,656
Shit, it's a trick.

1683
02:04:03,764 --> 02:04:06,164
Commence Operation Firestorm.
Send everyone.

1684
02:04:06,266 --> 02:04:07,067
- Get those Marines on the ground.
- Roll in strike packages...

1685
02:04:07,067 --> 02:04:08,830
- Get those Marines on the ground.
- Roll in strike packages...

1686
02:04:09,202 --> 02:04:10,794
Task Force Ripper, execute Lightning.

1687
02:04:31,324 --> 02:04:33,849
- Spotted Sam!
- Sam!

1688
02:04:34,327 --> 02:04:35,589
Ironhide!

1689
02:04:36,496 --> 02:04:38,623
Follow us to the pillars.
We'll take you to Optimus.

1690
02:04:41,535 --> 02:04:44,129
Get out, Sam! Get to the pillars!

1691
02:04:45,439 --> 02:04:46,497
Let's go.

1692
02:04:50,243 --> 02:04:53,701
Oh, God. This is it. The pyramid's built
right over the machine.

1693
02:04:53,814 --> 02:04:58,148
If they turn that machine on,
no more sun.

1694
02:05:00,654 --> 02:05:01,985
Not on my watch.

1695
02:05:02,456 --> 02:05:05,050
Not on my watch.

1696
02:05:16,069 --> 02:05:17,559
USS Stennis. Identify.

1697
02:05:17,671 --> 02:05:20,071
Where the hell are you?
Watching the Weather Channel?

1698
02:05:20,173 --> 02:05:22,038
SportsCenter?
I Dream of Jeannie or something?

1699
02:05:22,142 --> 02:05:26,101
We got 300 satellites up there.
Where the hell are all our men?

1700
02:05:26,213 --> 02:05:27,703
Identify yourself.

1701
02:05:28,248 --> 02:05:29,442
What is your name, sailor?

1702
02:05:30,050 --> 02:05:34,987
Wilder, Captain of the
USS John C. Stennis aircraft carrier.

1703
02:05:36,356 --> 02:05:37,983
Okay, Captain Wilder.

1704
02:05:38,091 --> 02:05:40,389
This is Agent Seymour Simmons
of Sector Seven.

1705
02:05:40,494 --> 02:05:42,860
There is the mother
of all non-biologicals

1706
02:05:42,963 --> 02:05:44,726
getting ready to blow up our sun.

1707
02:05:44,831 --> 02:05:46,628
Do you want to have a throwdown
about my lack of clearance

1708
02:05:46,733 --> 02:05:48,724
or do you want to help save
a gazillion lives?

1709
02:05:49,736 --> 02:05:52,068
All right, Agent Simmons. I'm listening.

1710
02:05:59,279 --> 02:06:00,013
Five clicks west of the Gulf,

1711
02:06:00,013 --> 02:06:01,947
Five clicks west of the Gulf,

1712
02:06:02,048 --> 02:06:05,017
we got ourselves an alien
remodeling a pyramid.

1713
02:06:05,118 --> 02:06:08,110
Our one hope is a prototype weapon
called a rail gun,

1714
02:06:08,221 --> 02:06:11,247
- shoots a steel projectile at Mach 7.
- That's classified.

1715
02:06:11,358 --> 02:06:14,861
Don't talk to me about classified,
all right?

1716
02:06:15,028 --> 02:06:17,690
Now, if you've got a battleship
in the Gulf, which I know you do,

1717
02:06:17,797 --> 02:06:20,288
you tell them to ready that weapon!

1718
02:06:21,701 --> 02:06:23,862
Contact destroyer USS KIDD.

1719
02:06:24,771 --> 02:06:26,432
Alpha Team, flank left!

1720
02:06:26,540 --> 02:06:28,269
This way! Move it!

1721
02:06:30,243 --> 02:06:32,473
- Where do you need us, sir?
- Protect those in the line of fire.

1722
02:06:32,579 --> 02:06:34,171
Let's go! Go!

1723
02:06:38,118 --> 02:06:40,586
Give me your Comms. Come on. Epps!

1724
02:06:45,025 --> 02:06:47,391
Right now, we need air support, ASAP!

1725
02:06:47,494 --> 02:06:50,019
Have troops in contact 20 miles
northwest. Radar contact.

1726
02:06:50,130 --> 02:06:51,222
Proceed to 88 Alpha Sierra...

1727
02:06:55,368 --> 02:06:56,926
B-1, snap 090.

1728
02:06:57,037 --> 02:06:59,403
You are approved to drop your
2,000-pound JDAMs.

1729
02:07:06,646 --> 02:07:07,977
- What you got?
- I couldn't get to them, sir.

1730
02:07:08,081 --> 02:07:10,106
They're 600 meters away
and they're heading right for the pillars.

1731
02:07:10,216 --> 02:07:13,049
All right. Precious cargo's coming!

1732
02:07:13,420 --> 02:07:14,352
Move!

1733
02:07:25,265 --> 02:07:26,755
Curse you!

1734
02:07:40,780 --> 02:07:42,839
Sam! Spotted Sam!

1735
02:08:15,148 --> 02:08:16,877
- Come on!
- 2-2 covering fire.

1736
02:08:16,983 --> 02:08:18,382
Two civilians, 12 o'clock!

1737
02:08:26,960 --> 02:08:28,484
Cover for us!

1738
02:08:34,934 --> 02:08:37,664
Hold the air strike!
We're rescuing civilians!

1739
02:08:50,016 --> 02:08:51,574
Keep firing!

1740
02:08:57,590 --> 02:08:59,217
Come on! Mikaela!

1741
02:08:59,693 --> 02:09:01,991
Come on! Get in here!

1742
02:09:02,962 --> 02:09:04,395
Look who showed up.

1743
02:09:04,497 --> 02:09:06,465
You better have a good reason for us
to be here.

1744
02:09:06,566 --> 02:09:08,261
- Where's Optimus?
- He's right over there,

1745
02:09:08,368 --> 02:09:09,767
across the courtyard.

1746
02:09:10,503 --> 02:09:12,801
- I got to get to him right now.
- Not with an air strike coming.

1747
02:09:12,906 --> 02:09:15,101
I have to get to him right now.

1748
02:09:16,676 --> 02:09:17,973
Go. Back, back, back, back.

1749
02:09:18,078 --> 02:09:19,773
- Go.
- Listen up...

1750
02:09:23,249 --> 02:09:24,409
Okay.

1751
02:09:28,088 --> 02:09:29,419
Incoming!

1752
02:09:30,457 --> 02:09:32,652
Stick the landing.

1753
02:09:33,593 --> 02:09:36,426
Behold the glory of Jetfire!

1754
02:09:37,764 --> 02:09:41,291
Now let me show you how we brought
the pain in my day!

1755
02:10:01,387 --> 02:10:02,649
I'm too old for this crap.

1756
02:10:02,856 --> 02:10:05,450
Keep going, man, 15 rounds of fighting.

1757
02:10:25,645 --> 02:10:29,103
I am directly below
the enemy's scrotum.

1758
02:10:29,916 --> 02:10:33,181
25.7 meters above sea level,
29.32 north.

1759
02:10:33,286 --> 02:10:35,481
- Kill track, 5205...
- Target acquired.

1760
02:10:35,588 --> 02:10:38,148
- Killing track.
- Two, one...

1761
02:10:38,258 --> 02:10:39,520
Fire!

1762
02:10:53,740 --> 02:10:55,332
Yeah! Yeah!

1763
02:10:55,775 --> 02:10:59,404
B- 1's time on target, 30 seconds.
2,000-pound JDAMs inbound.

1764
02:10:59,512 --> 02:11:01,605
We're gonna make a break through
the B's on my command, okay?

1765
02:11:01,714 --> 02:11:04,615
You guys stick with me, you
understand? You stay on my ass.

1766
02:11:04,851 --> 02:11:08,082
- 1-1 tally orange smoke.
- I hope these F-16s got good aim.

1767
02:11:08,188 --> 02:11:11,715
- Yeah? Why is that?
- I told them to hit the orange smoke.

1768
02:11:13,326 --> 02:11:14,759
You mean that orange smoke?

1769
02:11:14,861 --> 02:11:16,419
It wasn't my best toss, okay?

1770
02:11:16,529 --> 02:11:19,259
- Viper, thunder.
- Run!

1771
02:11:28,308 --> 02:11:29,536
Incoming!

1772
02:11:32,679 --> 02:11:33,907
Come on!

1773
02:11:54,200 --> 02:11:55,326
Sam!

1774
02:12:03,209 --> 02:12:04,403
Run!

1775
02:12:07,380 --> 02:12:08,404
Die!

1776
02:12:15,521 --> 02:12:16,715
Sam!

1777
02:12:32,972 --> 02:12:34,462
Hold your fire!

1778
02:12:36,910 --> 02:12:38,036
Sam!

1779
02:12:39,712 --> 02:12:41,907
Stay back! Mikaela, stay back!

1780
02:12:44,017 --> 02:12:46,008
Fucking do something!

1781
02:13:21,421 --> 02:13:27,621
- Sam! Sam!
- Sam! Sam! Sam! Sammy! Sam!

1782
02:13:29,462 --> 02:13:31,225
- Let me go!
- Come on, you got to move.

1783
02:13:31,331 --> 02:13:34,095
- You got to move, come on.
- We got no pulse.

1784
02:13:34,200 --> 02:13:35,292
Starting CPR.

1785
02:13:35,401 --> 02:13:38,564
- I have to see my kid! I got a son...
- Sammy!

1786
02:13:39,339 --> 02:13:40,431
Sam!

1787
02:13:42,809 --> 02:13:44,333
- Clear.
- Ready to shock.

1788
02:13:44,444 --> 02:13:47,174
- Clear!
- Ready to shock. One, two, three.

1789
02:13:50,149 --> 02:13:51,548
Do it again!

1790
02:13:57,090 --> 02:13:58,387
No!

1791
02:14:00,460 --> 02:14:05,488
Okay, listen to my voice.
I love you and I need you.

1792
02:14:06,799 --> 02:14:10,326
Please. Please, come back to me.
Sam, please!

1793
02:14:10,436 --> 02:14:11,960
I love you.

1794
02:14:21,381 --> 02:14:25,715
Where am I? Where am I?
Am I dead? Am I dead?

1795
02:14:26,252 --> 02:14:30,484
We have been watching you
a long, long time.

1796
02:14:32,892 --> 02:14:36,885
You have fought for Optimus,
our last descendant,

1797
02:14:36,996 --> 02:14:42,024
with courage and with sacrifice,
the virtues of a leader,

1798
02:14:43,002 --> 02:14:45,527
a leader worthy of our secret.

1799
02:14:46,139 --> 02:14:50,735
The Matrix of Leadership is not found,
it is earned.

1800
02:14:52,011 --> 02:14:54,172
Return now to Optimus.

1801
02:14:54,914 --> 02:14:57,212
Merge the Matrix with his spark.

1802
02:14:57,817 --> 02:15:02,345
It is, and always has been, your destiny.

1803
02:15:07,326 --> 02:15:08,418
Sam!

1804
02:15:14,934 --> 02:15:17,334
I love you. I love you.

1805
02:15:54,807 --> 02:15:58,140
Boy, you returned for me.

1806
02:15:59,479 --> 02:16:01,413
A living Prime.

1807
02:16:03,049 --> 02:16:05,210
I don't believe it!

1808
02:16:15,294 --> 02:16:17,694
My Matrix!

1809
02:16:23,069 --> 02:16:24,934
Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up!

1810
02:16:25,872 --> 02:16:27,362
Get up, Prime!

1811
02:16:29,308 --> 02:16:30,639
Oh, no.

1812
02:16:31,043 --> 02:16:34,979
He's turning on the machine!
You got to stop him! Get up!

1813
02:16:35,515 --> 02:16:36,846
Optimus!

1814
02:16:39,085 --> 02:16:41,417
Fallen, my master.

1815
02:16:41,521 --> 02:16:45,958
My brothers could not stop me from this.

1816
02:16:46,893 --> 02:16:51,227
Yes, now I claim your sun.

1817
02:16:53,566 --> 02:16:56,660
- Move!
- Enemy target, top of pyramid. Engage!

1818
02:16:56,769 --> 02:16:58,259
Engage! Engage!

1819
02:17:03,776 --> 02:17:06,677
In moments, we'll be at firing strength.

1820
02:17:22,328 --> 02:17:26,822
All my Decepticon life, I never did
a thing worth doing until now.

1821
02:17:27,400 --> 02:17:30,301
Optimus, take my parts

1822
02:17:30,403 --> 02:17:33,531
and you will have a power
you've never known.

1823
02:17:34,540 --> 02:17:36,531
Fulfill your destiny.

1824
02:17:42,882 --> 02:17:44,679
Jolt! Electrify!

1825
02:17:45,184 --> 02:17:47,084
Transplant those afterburners.

1826
02:18:05,438 --> 02:18:07,030
Let's roll.

1827
02:18:09,542 --> 02:18:11,567
Fire mission on the pyramids.

1828
02:18:23,489 --> 02:18:26,890
This planet will be dark forever.

1829
02:18:49,148 --> 02:18:51,548
Die, like your brothers!

1830
02:18:52,218 --> 02:18:54,413
They were your brothers, too.

1831
02:19:23,316 --> 02:19:25,147
Starscream!

1832
02:19:38,197 --> 02:19:40,324
You picked the wrong planet.

1833
02:19:43,336 --> 02:19:45,201
Give me your face.

1834
02:19:53,746 --> 02:19:55,373
I rise.

1835
02:19:55,948 --> 02:19:57,506
You fall.

1836
02:20:00,353 --> 02:20:02,753
No, no.

1837
02:20:04,857 --> 02:20:07,257
Not to call you a coward, Master,

1838
02:20:07,360 --> 02:20:12,992
but sometimes cowards do survive.

1839
02:20:13,632 --> 02:20:15,566
This isn't over.

1840
02:20:43,295 --> 02:20:46,128
It took all this for you to tell me that
you love me.

1841
02:20:47,767 --> 02:20:49,291
You said it first.

1842
02:21:10,291 --> 02:21:29,291
亲，有空的时候可以来交流电影哦 加我QQ：1610169789

1843
02:21:40,486 --> 02:21:43,080
Thank you, Sam, for saving my life.

1844
02:21:44,423 --> 02:21:45,685
Welcome.

1845
02:21:46,492 --> 02:21:48,187
Thank you for believing in me.

1846
02:21:53,065 --> 02:21:57,559
Our races united by a history
long forgotten

1847
02:21:57,670 --> 02:22:01,071
and a future we shall face together.

1848
02:22:01,640 --> 02:22:04,040
I am Optimus Prime,

1849
02:22:04,143 --> 02:22:09,137
and I send this message so that our
pasts will always be remembered,

1850
02:22:09,248 --> 02:22:13,116
for in those memories, we live on.

1851
02:22:35,975 --> 02:22:38,808
So glad you could join us,
Professor Einstein.

1852
02:22:39,345 --> 02:22:41,245
Yeah, I was kind of busy.

1853
02:22:43,949 --> 02:22:45,109
Okay.
