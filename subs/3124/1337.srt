1
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,237
We are closed.

2
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,114
Just a small drink.

3
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,205
The toilets?

4
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,719
A quick drink and then l'll leave.

5
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,393
Why are you rushing off?

6
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,104
l said, "Why are you rushing off?"

7
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,647
l don't understand.

8
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,818
The man from Bristol called you.

9
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,409
- What man? - The man in the wheelchair.

10
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,282
What were you doing back here?

11
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,118
Lady,

12
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:56,123
l never walk into a place l don't know how to walk out of.

13
00:06:56,332 --> 00:07:00,085
- Then why would you get into that van? - You know the reason.

14
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,074
Make yourselves at home.

15
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,413
You've come a long way. Thanks for coming.

16
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:19,831
What's the job?

17
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,918
There are some people who have something we require.

18
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:27,130
- And we want you to get it from them. - lt involves shooting?

19
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,841
You must be tired.

20
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,011
We'll tell you more tomorrow.

21
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,604
Seven fat years and seven lean years.

22
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,815
That's what it says in the Bible.

23
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,484
You ever kill anybody?

24
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,237
l hurt somebody's feelings once.

25
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,411
Don't l know you?

26
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,997
l don't think so.

27
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,167
l'd remember.

28
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,175
Okay. Two- hour shifts.

29
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,468
- l'll watch the front. - For later.

30
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,262
You guys watch the back.

31
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,488
You awake, then?

32
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,331
How we doing?

33
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,441
You labor or management?

34
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:13,278
lf l was management, l wouldn't have given you a cigarette.

35
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,865
l am the tour guide.

36
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,575
Over there is the Eiffel Tower.

37
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,870
Over here, the Louvre. Over there, les toilettes.

38
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,832
- What do l call you? - My name is Vincent.

39
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,000
Sam.

40
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:34,424
As per the agreement, your salary will be $5,000 a week

41
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,177
with a minimum of four weeks' work.

42
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,055
On the successful completion of the mission

43
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,432
you will each receive a bonus

44
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,517
of $20,000.

45
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,146
And by the way, my name is Deirdre.

46
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:53,109
- The broad outlines of the mission are... - Who are your principals?

47
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,612
For you there's no one but myself.

48
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:59,991
And what can we infer from your charming lrish lilt?

49
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,368
Anything you like.

50
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,244
Where's the equipment?

51
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,747
Tell me what you need. Make a list and give it to Vincent.

52
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:09,584
- Some of the equipment is quite technical. - lf it's in Paris, l'll find it for you.

53
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,670
This is what we're after.

54
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,883
We need to take it intact from several men who'll be intent on preventing us.

55
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,094
- How many men? - You American?

56
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:22,055
l think the group would be quite small. Between five and eight.

57
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,264
No more than eight.

58
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,225
So you would think. You don't know for sure?

59
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,727
l don't know now, but l will know before the event.

60
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,772
lf you don't know, why do you say between five and eight?

61
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,483
Because there's two to three cars. The group's traveling.

62
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,110
- They're not in Paris? - No.

63
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,404
- Where are they? - You'll find out soon enough.

64
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,197
What's in the case?

65
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:43,118
Our plan, in the broad strokes, is an ambush.

66
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:46,204
lt's to hit the car, to take them in transit.

67
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,164
Transit? City, country?

68
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,958
Right now, as l said, l don't know.

69
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,169
But we have to move very quickly. We have to improvise.

70
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:56,715
We'll start with this: Ambush and assault on two to three vehicles,

71
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:01,219
five to eight men, and our objective is the safe retrieval of this case.

72
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,888
Tell Vincent what it is you'll need.

73
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,268
What do we know about them? Are they French?

74
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,603
Where are they from? Who are they?

75
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:14,357
All you need to know right now is that they're very unpleasant.

76
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,986
- You've done this kind of thing before? - No.

77
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,071
How difficult can it be?

78
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,198
We have no idea how these men will be armed?

79
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,325
We'll assume they'll be very well armed, indeed.

80
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,703
Where are we going and how are we getting back from there?

81
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,831
lt'll be in France, and the group will disband at the RV point.

82
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:33,585
- What does she mean? - After that, we're on our own.

83
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,879
- lt's a military term. - That's right.

84
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,840
Larry, can you tell Vincent what it is you'll need?

85
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,593
Something very fast. Audi S8.

86
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,928
Something that can shove a little bit.

87
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,847
l'm going to have it for you by the afternoon.

88
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:49,559
l'm also gonna need a nitrous system. l've got the specs.

89
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,108
What do you use, weapons- wise?

90
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,279
Weapons. l'm a weapons man.

91
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,198
- Weapons man? - Yeah.

92
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,657
Okay.

93
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,536
They tend to settle the argument. So what do you favor?

94
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,289
lt's a toolbox. l don't care.

95
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,875
- You put the tools in for the job. That's all. - What?

96
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,711
You know, l actually favor the old 1911.

97
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:20,215
Forty- five? Old gun.

98
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,594
lt served my country well. A long time.

99
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,097
Your country. Not done too well though, have you?

100
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,557
- Last few wars? - Perhaps not,

101
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,393
but at least we don't go around whining about it.

102
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,146
You ex- military?

103
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,941
No, l got my job through The New York Times.

104
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,318
Don't let him get you down.

105
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,736
lt don't mean nothing to me.

106
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,571
l say what l think.

107
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,615
You ex- military?

108
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,284
Or is it Hereford?

109
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:52,080
l'm sorry, but l like to do it backwards. The line of retreat is?

110
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:56,167
She just told you. We meet back at the RV, disband.

111
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:59,921
l understand. l'm just trying to get a vague notion of the opposition.

112
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:03,800
l mean, we're setting out to cause some animosity over here, and l...

113
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,094
Who and how many are going to be coming after us?

114
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,762
You worried about saving your own skin?

115
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,139
Yeah, l am. lt covers my body.

116
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:15,270
All your concerns will be addressed before we leave.

117
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:18,606
- Electronics and commo. - Not more than three cars?

118
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,275
That is our information.

119
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,069
- Can you get me a simulator? - What's a simulator?

120
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:26,781
Gunpowder. Sound only, no lead. Sounds like a pistol, an assault rifle.

121
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,491
Quite diverting.

122
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,119
Listen, l'm also going to need some bigger injection jets.

123
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,038
The Bosch is not going to do it. Must be custom made.

124
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,623
Are we going north or are we going south?

125
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,251
- And l'm gonna need two nitrous tubes. - l know a guy.

126
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:42,130
- l'd like some new clothes. - Vincent will sort you out.

127
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,132
l'll take care of it.

128
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:54,225
- So what brought you here? - A fellow that doesn't work so well.

129
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,811
The man in the wheelchair?

130
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,315
How did he get there?

131
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,650
Seems to me that was in your neck of the woods

132
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,069
back in the late unpleasantness.

133
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,707
Good reflexes.

134
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,001
Yeah.

135
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,712
They die hard.

136
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,388
- lnterrogation. - What?

137
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,767
Methods to withstand interrogation.

138
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,477
You've done that?

139
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,272
We were taught to hold out indefinitely.

140
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,068
Nobody can hold out indefinitely.

141
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,738
- ls that so? - Yeah. Everybody has a limit.

142
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,033
l spent some time in interrogation, once.

143
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,662
- They make it hard on you? - They don't make it easy.

144
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,705
Yeah, it was unpleasant.

145
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,542
l held out as long as l could. All the stuff they tried.

146
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:06,130
You just can't hold out forever. lmpossible.

147
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,008
- How'd they finally get to you? - They gave me a grasshopper.

148
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,468
What's a grasshopper?

149
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:13,346
Let's see. That's two part gin, two part brandy,

150
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,098
one part creme de menthe and...

151
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,808
Fucking smart ass.

152
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:21,062
- Can you find this place? - Of course.

153
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,522
l know it.

154
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,191
That's where they wanna do the exchange.

155
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,569
You're gonna exchange for cash?

156
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,572
- Aye. - You know these people?

157
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,324
My people know them.

158
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,993
Your people have done business with them before

159
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,745
or these people just gave your people a number?

160
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,133
Larry.

161
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,097
Okay.

162
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,143
lf we're gonna do it, let's do the goddamn thing right.

163
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:04,147
- Hey. - l'm busy.

164
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,609
Okay, come on. Let's go.

165
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,779
The answers to your questions l'll know when l get back.

166
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:14,157
- l'll go with you. - Go with them.

167
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,805
Who's this girl work for?

168
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,641
Well, she works for our "betters."

169
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,978
lt seems that's what we're meant to know.

170
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,823
Always a waiting game.

171
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,201
- What? - lt's a waiting game.

172
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,957
Would you not do that, please?

173
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,506
Bad for the night vision, yeah?

174
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,763
There they are.

175
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,730
- You have the list? - Yes, l have it.

176
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,566
Give it to me.

177
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,571
Money?

178
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,658
Okay. You follow my lead.

179
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,995
Just make sure you watch my back.

180
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,418
Don't make any sudden moves.

181
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:34,130
Just because we're buying guns doesn't mean we didn't bring any.

182
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,756
Don't worry. Everything's fine.

183
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,890
You want to back him up?

184
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,228
What would l profit from your death?

185
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:53,274
- Well, you'd have the money. - l have the money already.

186
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,612
l'll watch the back.

187
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,326
Have you got it all?

188
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,788
- You're sure? - Of course. Come and see.

189
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,009
There it is.

190
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,155
lt's not all here.

191
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,993
- Vincent. - What?

192
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,540
lt's not all here.

193
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:07,556
He said the rest is in the other car. The boss wants to check the money.

194
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:12,520
lf he agrees, we have no problem. Here, take the car keys.

195
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,773
Go on. Take them.

196
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:18,484
There you are. No problem.

197
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,404
Come along. Come on.

198
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,659
Okay. Give me some of the money.

199
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,626
Give me some of the money.

200
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,464
- Okay. - You aren't going in there?

201
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,175
Yeah, l'm going in there. So are you.

202
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:46,137
- Why am l going in there? - Why? To protect me.

203
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,389
There is no protection there.

204
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,141
lf it's a come- on, we're fish in a barrel.

205
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,143
What are you doing? Why do they want you in there?

206
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:55,187
- What are you, crazy? - You think too hard.

207
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:59,442
Nobody ever told me that before, but l wouldn't go in there.

208
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:03,696
- What is it, Sam? - l don't like it. Look at it.

209
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,324
Okay, okay.

210
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:10,369
Okay, let's just do it. Lets just do it and be done, yeah?

211
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,247
You don't want to go in there.

212
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:16,417
l'm getting paid to go. lt's that simple.

213
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,587
- Okay, come on. Let's go. - lf anything goes down

214
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,255
get next to one of those guys.

215
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,758
lf there's a sniper, he'll be afraid to shoot his own guy.

216
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,593
- Let's go. - All right.

217
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:48,783
Stop!

218
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,118
Stay where you are.

219
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,137
So, everything's fine.

220
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,817
Shit, l can't see! l can't see!

221
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,958
Come on! Have some of this!

222
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,921
Fucking have some!

223
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,095
Fucking have some more!

224
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,850
Come on!

225
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,605
- Let's go! - You goddamn...

226
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,816
Come on! Let's go!

227
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,873
- Anybody hurt? ls anybody hurt? - We're fine.

228
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:25,546
Almost a bit of raspberry jam back there?

229
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,048
A bit of raspberry jam back there.

230
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:35,097
Got the swag, kept the money. Job well done.

231
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,266
That's a fact. That is a fact.

232
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,835
Slow down. Slow down. Slow down.

233
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,922
l think l have to stop.

234
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,452
Thank you.

235
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,757
Why did you take this job?

236
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,844
My friend, l need the money.

237
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,265
The money is here.

238
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:07,106
That's what this is, you know? Money.

239
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:13,529
Yeah, but who are our employers?

240
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,283
You're right.

241
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:46,937
Excuse me.

242
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,148
Excuse me, monsieur.

243
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,535
The Russians are trying to bid for the case.

244
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:05,497
The case is in Nice. They're trying to sell it to the Russians.

245
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,960
They're staying at the Villa Belle Mer in Nice.

246
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:13,756
- The team isn't ready. - Whatever the team is, you do it now.

247
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:18,052
The Russians have decided to bid. We need to move now.

248
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,553
Excuse me.

249
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:23,474
l have the information. We'll be moving very soon.

250
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,809
lt'll definitely be in the nature of an ambush

251
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,562
somewhere between here and here.

252
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:33,233
We'll anticipate a three- car convoy with a backup team.

253
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:37,905
And obviously we will try and stop the target before they can get away from us.

254
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,240
- What's in the case? - That information isn't necessary.

255
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:44,286
ls it heavy, is it explosive, is it chained to some unlucky bloke's wrist?

256
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,580
- Are we gonna have to chop it off... - All right.

257
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,749
But l am not under any obligation to let you know...

258
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,377
lf you are not, then the price has got to go up.

259
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,587
l'll get you the case, but the price has got to go up.

260
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:57,091
lf it's going to be amateur night, l want $100,000. l want it up front.

261
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:01,720
l want it in a bank account. l want another $100,000 when you get the case.

262
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,337
Okay.

263
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,300
We've got shooters here,

264
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:42,636
shooters here.

265
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:45,347
- l'll tell you an old trick. - Hey.

266
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,693
- What's your problem? - Draw it again.

267
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:02,698
Draw it again. You're the ace field man. Draw it again.

268
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:06,660
lt's a simple diagram. Just draw it again. Draw what you saw.

269
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:11,248
Draw it again!

270
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:17,171
Two shooters. Car comes through here.

271
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:19,631
Shooters across from each other, kill each other dead.

272
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,592
Oh, my! Where'd you learn that?

273
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,385
- ln the regiment. - What regiment was that?

274
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,803
The 22nd Special Air Service.

275
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:30,350
What's the color of the boathouse at Hereford?

276
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,560
l don't like your attitude...

277
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:32,770
What's the color of the boathouse...

278
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,980
- Fuck off! - What's... You got the gun. l'm unarmed.

279
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,649
Do something. Go ahead. Do something.

280
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:53,582
Tell me about an ambush? Tell me about an ambush?

281
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:56,084
l ambushed you with a cup of coffee.

282
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,508
You'll get your money when we get the case.

283
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,469
- The others too. - That is what l understood.

284
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,847
Come on, we've gotten the word. We're moving.

285
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,606
Put this near the front.

286
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,608
Careful!

287
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:22,402
Careful with that.

288
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,999
So what color is the boathouse at Hereford?

289
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:39,753
How the fuck should l know?

290
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,861
This'll complete your compensation.

291
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:09,783
Thanks for your time. Feel free to leave when we're gone.

292
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:14,288
Do l need to suggest that you forget us?

293
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,001
Because we will not forget.

294
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,149
'Morning.

295
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,652
l see you're reviewing our problem.

296
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:29,696
Yeah, either you're part of the problem or you're part of the solution

297
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,406
or you're just part of the landscape.

298
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:35,160
- lndeed. - What's in the case?

299
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:37,913
Something we're paying you for.

300
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:57,391
- You and the girl are in front of the hotel. - The name's Deirdre.

301
00:32:57,433 --> 00:33:00,227
Deirdre. Wait outside the hotel for the target.

302
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,646
He leaves the hotel for the villa, the villa for the hotel.

303
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:06,274
He activates his cell phone. How do you know he's gonna use his cell phone?

304
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,819
- He'll use a phone. - How do you know?

305
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,362
l'm gonna call him on it.

306
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:13,865
- How do you know he'll have it with him? - He's waiting for a call.

307
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:15,575
The people he's doing business with

308
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,703
will call him to tell him the location of the meet.

309
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:19,162
- Okay? - Okay.

310
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:23,875
The villa, the hotel, the car, the stoplight, eight to 10 guys...

311
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:26,003
How good's the security?

312
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,797
- l can't tell you. - Well, let's find out. Where are they?

313
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:30,590
Last report, they were at the hotel.

314
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,135
- The case is at the hotel? - We presume that it is.

315
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,846
- That's interesting. - Why don't we do it now?

316
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,014
lt's tempting.

317
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,182
lt's a good plan. Let's stick to the plan.

318
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:42,394
Everybody wants to go to the party. Nobody wants to stay and clean up.

319
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:43,478
Please.

320
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:47,399
The only thing is that the map, the map is not the territory.

321
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,153
Let's go look at the ground.

322
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:54,156
Bring some money. We're gonna do a little shopping.

323
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,790
Listen up.

324
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:08,211
You're my wife. Maybe you want to look like it.

325
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:11,673
lt's just a game. Just a game.

326
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:16,178
Man and woman going for a walk and all that that entails. Piece of cake.

327
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,722
Relax. Relax, darling.

328
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,850
You look good cleaned up.

329
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,481
That's the hotel?

330
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:31,568
Taxi.

331
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:46,374
Put your arm under mine. Put your arm under mine.

332
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:51,379
So why aren't they at the villa? Why are they down here?

333
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:54,674
Fun and games? Pretty girls and beer or what?

334
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,066
Can l help you, sir?

335
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,859
We're just looking at the menu.

336
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,693
Excuse me. Do you speak English?

337
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:55,944
A little.

338
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:58,238
Could you take a picture of me and my wife?

339
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,031
lt's very easy. You press like that.

340
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,575
- Very easy. - Sure.

341
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:06,371
Like that. That's it. Focus like that. Okay?

342
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,083
- We're gonna do it over here. - Okay.

343
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,422
- Could you get that palm tree in? - Yeah.

344
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:17,424
We wanna show we're on the Riviera.

345
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,758
Bye now.

346
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:21,386
- How many do you want? - Just snap away.

347
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,432
Very good.

348
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,683
Again.

349
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,269
Again. Get the background.

350
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:35,108
Take a couple of my wife. Just take a couple of my wife, alone.

351
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,739
NO TRESPASSlNG

352
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,287
Take my luggage up right away.

353
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,541
Thank you.

354
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:57,380
Can we take one picture of you with my wife? One picture with you?

355
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,508
That's it.

356
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,226
So?

357
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:11,561
They're good.

358
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:15,190
A guy goes for the case, the other guy's protecting the principal.

359
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,192
Nobody panics. They're good.

360
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,818
So what have we learned?

361
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,362
Can it be done?

362
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,864
lt can be done. We should have two more men.

363
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,616
We don't have two more men.

364
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:25,909
Go to your handler.

365
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,994
- There is no handler. - Let me go.

366
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,996
There's no handler. There's only me.

367
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,998
Listen, you want this thing, you want the case,

368
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,416
we're gonna need some more men.

369
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:36,586
There's no more help. There's no more men. Are you afraid?

370
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:39,297
Of course l'm afraid. You think l'm reluctant because l'm happy?

371
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:42,384
We've made a good plan, and we're gonna stick with it.

372
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,932
What do we do?

373
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,643
We wait.

374
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,523
So who are they?

375
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,358
Our employers.

376
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:04,572
lt's me.

377
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:08,201
They've gone back to the villa.

378
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,787
- Did they have the case with them? - They did.

379
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:12,414
- Did you get the other cars? - Got them.

380
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:15,125
- And how do they run? - They'll do fine.

381
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,257
Yeah.

382
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,303
What does that mean?

383
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,723
lt would be nice to do something.

384
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:33,059
We are doing something. We're sitting here, waiting.

385
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,611
lt's not gonna happen today.

386
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:46,072
The buyers are out of town.

387
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,325
Tomorrow at the earliest.

388
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:55,123
You know what? The hell with it. Let's go put them to bed.

389
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,416
We've got the report.

390
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,252
l take the report. l got nothing else. l can go and see for myself.

391
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,296
lf l don't go, then what am l? They at the villa?

392
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:05,383
All right, l'm gonna go take one last run over the route and tuck them in.

393
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,350
l'll come with you.

394
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:50,136
So how'd you get started in this business?

395
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:55,392
A wealthy scoundrel seduced and betrayed me.

396
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:59,521
Same with me. How about that?

397
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:04,317
Take out the map. lf anybody looks, we're...

398
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,377
So who are those guys inside?

399
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,170
You tell me.

400
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:29,592
Ex- military, Northern Sov Block, somebody or other.

401
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,345
Need a job. That's my excuse.

402
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,305
ls it?

403
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:37,767
The cops.

404
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,936
System activated.

405
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,065
System check.

406
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,446
Repeat system check.

407
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:40,663
There he is. He's being a good little boy. He's activated his phone.

408
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:02,769
l'm in position.

409
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,266
They're passing me now.

410
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,809
Target is on the way.

411
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:27,604
Hell of a time to be working.

412
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,857
What do you want for Christmas?

413
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,859
My two front teeth.

414
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:35,528
May your wish be granted.

415
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,483
Target is 400 meters from the traffic light.

416
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,421
Come on! Come on!

417
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:43,906
So far, so good. Target on the right road.

418
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,163
Sam, escort car.

419
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,457
Four- tenths of a click in front of you.

420
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:53,708
Got it.

421
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:25,865
Larry, you should see them in four seconds.

422
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,241
Two cars.

423
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:30,828
l got them.

424
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:15,873
Target has escaped. l repeat: Target has gotten away.

425
00:47:58,458 --> 00:47:59,792
Target heading for Vieux Nice.

426
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:08,736
Through the market, then straight.

427
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:18,996
Right at the fork, Marechal fork.

428
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:29,966
Okay, you're in front of him.

429
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,393
You can cut him off at the end of the port.

430
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,353
Roger that. l got it.

431
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:47,316
He's coming from the right.

432
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,735
He's yours.

433
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:51,922
- l'm hit! Take the case! - Up the other way!

434
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:53,299
Get the fucking case!

435
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:55,468
Get the car at the other end! We'll meet you up there!

436
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:57,136
- Take it. - All right.

437
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,345
Get out of here!

438
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,722
l'll see you at the safe house!

439
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:06,812
Get rid of the case!

440
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:23,829
Where is Gregor?

441
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:25,539
Gregor fucked us.

442
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,876
- How is it down there? - A lot of heat. How do you feel?

443
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:55,588
- Okay. Thanks for before. - Don't mention it.

444
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:00,467
Could you clean the paint off this?

445
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:04,847
- You got a pack of Camels in there? - No, you smoke too much.

446
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:21,238
We must get out of here.

447
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:25,075
l'm gonna need your people to help us.

448
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:28,412
- And l need you to find the case. - All right, call your guy.

449
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:31,790
- When we bring in the case, he'll help you. - How can l bring in the case?

450
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,375
Gregor has it.

451
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:37,963
- Why? - l presume to sell it to the Russians.

452
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:40,466
Why the Russians? Why not you?

453
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:43,802
lf we had the money to buy the case, we wouldn't have hired you to steal it,

454
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:44,887
would we?

455
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:47,473
- Go to your people. Talk to them. - You want the case?

456
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:50,935
- lf we find Gregor, we find the case. - How do we find Gregor?

457
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:53,479
How did you find him in the first place? How did you hire him?

458
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,314
l found him through your friend, the cripple,

459
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:57,274
who gave me nothing but a bunch of fucking lames!

460
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:59,443
You and Spence and the whole sorry lot of them.

461
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:00,569
Hey!

462
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:04,573
We can find him through his cell phone.

463
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:10,663
Can we trace his cell phone?

464
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:14,708
l can triangulate it.

465
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:18,295
- lf we had that equipment. - Who has that equipment?

466
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:22,007
Who has that equipment?

467
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:26,887
Tell me.

468
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:29,848
Who has it?

469
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:32,685
All right. All right.

470
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:35,521
Give me the number to his phone.

471
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:22,568
- So how does the day find you? - How do they say it in French,

472
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,028
en pleine forme?

473
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:40,502
This was supposed to be a social occasion.

474
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:43,213
- Life is uncertain. - lt is indeed.

475
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:47,217
But, Gregor, we have so much history together

476
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,470
l was sure you wouldn't mind.

477
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:52,639
Besides, the world these days is so...

478
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:56,143
- Unsafe? - Exactly.

479
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,646
l'll show you how unsafe it is.

480
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:24,963
See that little girl down there?

481
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,679
Have you lost your mind?

482
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:35,808
- Why did you do that? - To make a point.

483
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:42,815
l don't know her, but l was ready to splatter her brains all over the playground.

484
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:44,316
But you,

485
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:46,610
l don't particularly like you.

486
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:51,365
Just imagine what l'll do to you, if you try anything. Now give me my money.

487
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,007
Put down the gun.

488
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:18,350
- l never liked you either, Gregor. - Where did that come from?

489
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:24,523
- l should have made you strip. - Now where's my package?

490
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:26,442
lt's right behind you.

491
00:57:57,849 --> 00:57:59,892
Clever girl.

492
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:03,312
- You liked it? - My little sun.

493
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,733
You make me so happy.

494
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:09,485
My sweet love.

495
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:12,654
Excuse me.

496
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:17,784
ls it done?

497
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:21,330
lt's done, Mikhi.

498
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:28,045
Gregor? ls that you, Gregor?

499
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:32,299
- Much to your disappointment, no doubt. - lt was a mistake.

500
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,884
lt should not have happened.

501
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:37,095
Well, if it happens again, l'll turn around and sell it to the lrish.

502
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:38,430
Don't do that.

503
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:40,307
Then don't make me.

504
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,434
My price just went up 300%.

505
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,730
l want the package, Gregor.

506
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:50,275
- What do l have to do to get it? - Just wait for my next phone call.

507
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,986
l'll find a place where l can tilt the field in my favor.

508
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:39,825
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

509
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:42,452
Could you tell me how to find a post office?

510
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:45,497
Do l know you? l'm sorry, do l know you?

511
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:48,166
Because how did you know l speak English?

512
00:59:48,209 --> 00:59:52,129
- You got an English newspaper. - Sorry.

513
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:55,007
- l'm sorry. l beg your pardon. - lt's all right.

514
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:58,719
What do you need a post office for? Because over here,

515
00:59:58,803 --> 01:00:02,139
- they use it for different things. - l need your help.

516
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:05,017
- l thought you left. - l did leave.

517
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:07,728
- You did leave? You're out? - That's right.

518
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:10,314
Can you help me? l need your help.

519
01:00:11,649 --> 01:00:13,317
What's the number?

520
01:00:18,072 --> 01:00:21,742
- The post office is just down to your left. - Up on the left?

521
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:23,368
- On the left. - Thanks.

522
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:34,755
- A friend of yours? - Yeah. We went to high school together.

523
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:38,467
Everyone's your brother until the rent comes due.

524
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:39,718
Ain't that the truth?

525
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:42,888
On the terrace?

526
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,640
Facing me? l see him.

527
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:47,017
Yes, l'll get him. Hang on, please.

528
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:53,523
Excuse me, sir. Are you Sam?

529
01:00:55,943 --> 01:00:57,027
Yeah.

530
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,695
A phone call for you.

531
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:12,000
Yes, it's good to see you too. lf his position changes, l'll let you know.

532
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:21,218
Gregor's in a town called Arles.

533
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,837
He's at the arena.

534
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:15,248
So, this is the amphitheater of Arles

535
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:19,419
which was built at the end of the first century A.D.

536
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:21,755
lt is built with limestone.

537
01:03:29,555 --> 01:03:30,931
l know those men.

538
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:05,924
lt's inspired by this painting and you can see this dominant yellow color

539
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:08,426
which is actually caused essentially by a lantern.

540
01:04:08,469 --> 01:04:11,304
We're not sure that the walls were actually yellow.

541
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:15,851
And so now, we will continue and visit the Roman baths down this way.

542
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:31,658
Yeah.

543
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:38,290
Thank you, gentlemen. That'll do nicely.

544
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:44,796
- lt's Sergi. l remember you. - Yes, Gregor, it's me.

545
01:04:45,089 --> 01:04:47,090
- How've you been? - Well,

546
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:51,052
these are trying times. l'm sorry about the unfortunate incident.

547
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:53,263
- Oh, yeah. - lt was excessive.

548
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:58,018
- And, more to the point, it was foolish. - l couldn't agree with you more.

549
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:00,854
Mikhi did it without consulting me.

550
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:05,066
Yeah, he's turned rogue and can't be controlled, is that it?

551
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:24,836
- l don't... - Oh, English. Sorry.

552
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:28,006
Such a fool. l was looking for van Gogh's old house.

553
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:32,135
So what could've been conducted in a collegial atmosphere

554
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:36,306
is now fucked into a cocked hat. What do you think?

555
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:39,351
l think we'll meet your price.

556
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:44,522
Yeah, so let's see it. Let's see it now.

557
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:47,567
Where do you have it, in your belt? Let's see it.

558
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:49,527
Show me the case first.

559
01:05:50,988 --> 01:05:54,491
You're great in the locker room, pal, and your reflexes might die hard,

560
01:05:54,533 --> 01:05:57,452
but you're weak when you put your spikes on.

561
01:05:57,870 --> 01:06:00,747
- Gregor, are you all right? - Gregor's fine.

562
01:06:01,874 --> 01:06:04,542
But l think you're in a wee spot of trouble.

563
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:08,588
- Where is it? Where is it? - l don't have it with me.

564
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:10,882
- Where? - l mailed it to myself.

565
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:12,592
- Where is it? - Post office box in Paris.

566
01:06:13,761 --> 01:06:15,428
Help! He's robbing me!

567
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:04,996
Stop.

568
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:10,960
- Where do l know you from? - Vienna.

569
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:15,548
Of course. Sorry to have to do this.

570
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:35,777
- Christ. - Drive.

571
01:08:57,716 --> 01:09:00,218
Stop! Piss off.

572
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:24,450
l'm gonna have to take care of this.

573
01:09:25,619 --> 01:09:27,579
What do you want to do?

574
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:32,917
Get to a doctor or a veterinarian's office. l'll just boost what l need.

575
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:41,134
- Could you do that? - Of course. l can do better.

576
01:09:43,721 --> 01:09:46,431
- How is it? - l'm leaking.

577
01:09:48,475 --> 01:09:49,767
l'm sorry.

578
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:56,441
That girl sold us out.

579
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:01,946
She sold us out.

580
01:10:55,209 --> 01:10:57,961
- ls everything ready, Jean- Pierre? - Yes, everything.

581
01:11:17,022 --> 01:11:19,065
- Will you help me put my legs up? - Yeah.

582
01:11:19,149 --> 01:11:20,191
Careful.

583
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:34,080
- Are you sure you can do this? - Yeah.

584
01:11:34,164 --> 01:11:37,292
l once removed a guy's appendix with a grapefruit spoon.

585
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:39,752
- Have a drink? - No booze.

586
01:11:45,884 --> 01:11:48,303
Easy. Yeah.

587
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:00,523
lt's just below the surface.

588
01:12:02,234 --> 01:12:03,901
All right, let's do it.

589
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:06,154
Let's just douse it with alcohol.

590
01:12:09,116 --> 01:12:11,576
Take the gauze and wipe away as much of the blood as you can.

591
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:13,911
Keep it clean so l can see it.

592
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:31,137
What we're gonna do is routine. l've done this many times before.

593
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:34,265
There are no vital organs or arteries. lt's okay.

594
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:37,935
You won't kill me. Just make sure you get the bullet before you pry it out.

595
01:12:37,978 --> 01:12:40,229
- All right. - Take that scalpel.

596
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:46,361
The upper part.

597
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:51,824
Over here, just cut up there. Just a little cut.

598
01:13:03,128 --> 01:13:05,171
Okay. Try that.

599
01:13:07,132 --> 01:13:11,511
Take the clamp. Take the clamp and open up the hole.

600
01:13:12,096 --> 01:13:14,555
Just put it in there.

601
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:22,063
Now open it up. Spread it.

602
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:23,689
Okay.

603
01:13:24,316 --> 01:13:27,652
Now get the other clamps and get the bullet.

604
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:31,072
Remember, don't take it out unless you really got it.

605
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:50,925
Do it again. Do it again, just try once more.

606
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:06,941
When he pulls it out, put the gauze. There's gonna be a lot of blood.

607
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:15,575
Put the gauze there.

608
01:14:24,376 --> 01:14:27,044
Fucker sprayed his bullet with Teflon.

609
01:14:28,213 --> 01:14:31,883
He was trying to stamp me "Paid in full."

610
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:35,636
- ls that why it went through the vest? - Yeah.

611
01:14:36,763 --> 01:14:39,599
You think you could stitch me up on your own?

612
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:44,562
lf you don't mind, l'm gonna pass out.

613
01:15:33,987 --> 01:15:37,448
- You gonna kill me? - No.

614
01:15:38,408 --> 01:15:40,868
l'm not gonna kill you.

615
01:16:08,355 --> 01:16:10,565
Why would l want to kill you?

616
01:16:29,459 --> 01:16:31,961
- l gave you a job. - l did my job.

617
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:35,339
So how'd it go wrong?

618
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:37,800
l thought what you wanted was the case.

619
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:39,927
Oh, we'll get the case.

620
01:16:41,471 --> 01:16:43,806
We'll get the case, Gregor?

621
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:47,560
Don't you worry about the case.

622
01:16:50,522 --> 01:16:54,650
- But l want an explanation. - An explanation? For what?

623
01:16:55,902 --> 01:16:58,571
- You bollixed it up. - l bollixed it up?

624
01:16:58,822 --> 01:17:01,991
- You hired him. - Through your fucking contact!

625
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:12,001
- You didn't do your homework. - Why did you have to kill Larry?

626
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:13,336
Larry is it?

627
01:17:15,088 --> 01:17:17,757
- l was clearing up your mess. - My mess?

628
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:20,176
Well, you take over then.

629
01:17:20,218 --> 01:17:23,888
But you can't, can you? lt's you that's hiding, isn't it, Seamus?

630
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:26,432
lt's you that can't show your face.

631
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:32,605
Who else thinks that? Who you been talking to?

632
01:17:32,856 --> 01:17:35,733
lsn't that the reason why l'm doing this job?

633
01:17:38,403 --> 01:17:40,237
You're a good girl, Deirdre.

634
01:17:41,698 --> 01:17:43,282
Do yourjob.

635
01:17:57,756 --> 01:17:59,423
He's tough, your Yank.

636
01:18:00,717 --> 01:18:03,010
You're right about that.

637
01:18:04,721 --> 01:18:06,222
But who is he?

638
01:18:07,974 --> 01:18:09,100
That's not important.

639
01:18:11,103 --> 01:18:13,270
Didn't he work for the ClA?

640
01:18:13,438 --> 01:18:15,272
He used to.

641
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:18,192
Not anymore?

642
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:21,696
He's on the run.

643
01:18:23,407 --> 01:18:24,657
You're sure?

644
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:28,744
l know what he can do. l've seen him.

645
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:32,998
Why would he carve himself up if he were still ClA?

646
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:35,000
He makes a phone call, and it's taken care of.

647
01:18:46,012 --> 01:18:47,805
And you? How have you been?

648
01:18:57,149 --> 01:18:58,983
We need some information.

649
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:01,819
We need to find some people in Paris.

650
01:19:01,945 --> 01:19:03,487
Who?

651
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:06,365
An lrish man and woman...

652
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:08,617
and a German, ex- KGB.

653
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:10,411
They're professionals.

654
01:19:10,495 --> 01:19:12,037
And they're in hiding.

655
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:15,750
This is really important to you?

656
01:19:18,837 --> 01:19:20,504
He saved my life.

657
01:19:26,636 --> 01:19:29,096
l'll find them for you.

658
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:50,367
Where's the case?

659
01:19:54,498 --> 01:19:56,540
lt'll come tomorrow, l'm sure.

660
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:59,877
l'm sure it will, too. Let's go.

661
01:20:01,421 --> 01:20:03,923
Let's hope so, for your sake anyway.

662
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:38,666
- Are you feeling better? - Yeah, enough to move around. Thanks.

663
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:53,222
My hobby. One grows old.

664
01:20:56,601 --> 01:21:00,729
A lot of fellas, friends of mine, just wanted to live to open a bar.

665
01:21:00,897 --> 01:21:03,274
Had they lived, would they have done it?

666
01:21:05,443 --> 01:21:07,736
Then they were spared their disillusionment.

667
01:21:07,779 --> 01:21:09,280
Yeah, that's right.

668
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:13,450
Who were these people, friends of yours?

669
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:18,789
- l wouldn't hurt a friend. - Was that my question?

670
01:21:20,959 --> 01:21:22,459
That's right.

671
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:28,299
Well,

672
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:30,926
who are you?

673
01:21:32,178 --> 01:21:35,973
A fellow like you, trying to make it to retirement.

674
01:21:36,182 --> 01:21:40,185
At the end of the day, we're likely to be punished for our kindnesses.

675
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:43,814
You don't have to worry about me. l won't hurt you.

676
01:22:10,842 --> 01:22:13,093
The 47 ronin, do you know it?

677
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:20,017
Forty- seven samurai whose master was betrayed and killed by another lord.

678
01:22:20,852 --> 01:22:23,771
They became ronin, masterless samurai,

679
01:22:24,522 --> 01:22:27,149
disgraced by another man's treachery.

680
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:30,945
For three years they plotted, pretending to be thieves,

681
01:22:31,029 --> 01:22:33,322
mercenaries, even madmen.

682
01:22:33,698 --> 01:22:35,950
That l didn't have time to do.

683
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:38,619
And then one night they struck, slipping into the castle

684
01:22:38,703 --> 01:22:41,330
of their lord's betrayer, killing him.

685
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:44,625
Nice. l like that. My kind of job.

686
01:22:45,502 --> 01:22:47,378
There's something more.

687
01:22:48,254 --> 01:22:51,507
All 47 of them committed seppuku,

688
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:55,594
ritual suicide, in the courtyard of the castle.

689
01:22:56,429 --> 01:22:58,764
Well, that l don't like so much.

690
01:22:58,932 --> 01:23:00,808
But you understand it?

691
01:23:01,017 --> 01:23:03,227
What do you mean "l understand it"?

692
01:23:04,145 --> 01:23:05,771
The warrior code.

693
01:23:06,439 --> 01:23:09,566
The delight in the battle. You understand that, yes?

694
01:23:10,402 --> 01:23:12,403
But also something more.

695
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:17,491
You understand there is something outside yourself that has to be served.

696
01:23:18,034 --> 01:23:20,244
And when that need is gone,

697
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:23,372
when belief has died, what are you?

698
01:23:24,624 --> 01:23:26,583
A man without a master.

699
01:23:27,043 --> 01:23:29,586
Right now l'm a man without a paycheck.

700
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:32,798
The Ronin could have hired themselves to new masters.

701
01:23:32,882 --> 01:23:35,134
They could have fought for themselves.

702
01:23:35,218 --> 01:23:38,178
But they chose honor. They chose myth.

703
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:40,639
They chose wrong.

704
01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:51,358
Seppu... What?

705
01:23:52,152 --> 01:23:53,402
Seppuku.

706
01:23:53,945 --> 01:23:55,487
Disembowelment.

707
01:23:56,072 --> 01:23:57,948
The sword goes in here.

708
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:13,088
- Are you sure this address is good? - Jean- Pierre gave it to me.

709
01:24:46,706 --> 01:24:49,124
Under the bridge, by the river,

710
01:24:50,293 --> 01:24:52,711
how did you know it was an ambush?

711
01:24:53,588 --> 01:24:56,173
Whenever there is any doubt, there is no doubt.

712
01:24:56,216 --> 01:24:58,842
That's the first thing they teach you.

713
01:25:01,221 --> 01:25:02,763
Who taught you?

714
01:25:04,224 --> 01:25:07,392
l don't remember. That's the second thing they teach you.

715
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:15,484
All good things come to those who wait.

716
01:25:46,015 --> 01:25:49,184
- And why is Gregor still alive? - He's taking them to the package.

717
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:15,919
How you doing?

718
01:26:23,094 --> 01:26:25,721
What are you? What are you gonna do to me?

719
01:26:25,763 --> 01:26:29,057
Let's just be calm for one more moment.

720
01:26:29,767 --> 01:26:31,393
One more moment.

721
01:26:43,406 --> 01:26:44,448
Why?

722
01:26:45,783 --> 01:26:47,451
Oh, you know why.

723
01:26:48,328 --> 01:26:50,579
No. You don't want to do that.

724
01:26:54,167 --> 01:26:55,500
You can't.

725
01:26:59,923 --> 01:27:01,173
Get back!

726
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:04,426
Get in the fucking car! Get in the car.

727
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:15,646
Why didn't you shoot her?

728
01:28:08,032 --> 01:28:10,158
- Take the tunnel now! - Oh, Christ!

729
01:31:24,353 --> 01:31:25,562
Come on!

730
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:52,214
That fuck.

731
01:35:21,006 --> 01:35:23,633
Where could he be?

732
01:35:26,887 --> 01:35:30,640
The lrish are looking for him. The Russians are looking for him. So where does he go?

733
01:35:30,683 --> 01:35:34,144
He goes to the Russians to make the deal for the case.

734
01:35:34,478 --> 01:35:37,480
Gregor ain't coming in unless he can figure out a safe exchange.

735
01:35:37,523 --> 01:35:41,568
He knows they'll kill him for the case rather than pay him for it.

736
01:35:41,652 --> 01:35:45,113
He's got to work it out soon before the lrish find him.

737
01:35:47,533 --> 01:35:49,325
So where does he go?

738
01:35:51,162 --> 01:35:53,121
You go to what you know.

739
01:35:55,624 --> 01:35:59,544
He's KGB. He goes to one of his old safe houses.

740
01:36:00,921 --> 01:36:02,797
No, they're all blown.

741
01:36:04,383 --> 01:36:06,009
Where does he go?

742
01:36:11,182 --> 01:36:12,265
So?

743
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:15,602
You're on the run. Where do you go?

744
01:36:21,484 --> 01:36:23,693
Where's he been?

745
01:36:37,583 --> 01:36:39,459
He made the fake case.

746
01:36:40,294 --> 01:36:42,337
He had the fake case made.

747
01:36:42,630 --> 01:36:43,838
Gregor.

748
01:36:44,548 --> 01:36:47,717
He had it made. He had to have had it made.

749
01:36:50,638 --> 01:36:53,681
ln Paris, before we went to Nice.

750
01:36:53,724 --> 01:36:55,308
He didn't have time to have it made.

751
01:36:55,392 --> 01:36:58,102
He bought something that looked like it, then he spray- painted it.

752
01:36:58,187 --> 01:37:01,022
Where did he get this paint? He never left the room.

753
01:37:01,065 --> 01:37:02,816
Where did he get the case?

754
01:37:35,766 --> 01:37:37,892
lt's a case for ice skates.

755
01:37:41,105 --> 01:37:42,647
Why ice skates?

756
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:48,278
And why would Gregor know an ice skate case?

757
01:37:49,405 --> 01:37:51,948
He didn't have time to have it made.

758
01:37:51,991 --> 01:37:55,076
He didn't have time to have the fake case made.

759
01:37:55,661 --> 01:38:01,541
The Russians made it.

760
01:38:04,962 --> 01:38:07,213
We're following the wrong people.

761
01:38:07,298 --> 01:38:09,299
We don't have to find Gregor.

762
01:38:09,383 --> 01:38:12,302
lf we find the Russians, they will take us to him.

763
01:38:12,386 --> 01:38:15,138
You've lived in Paris a long time. You know the people.

764
01:38:15,222 --> 01:38:16,514
l get around.

765
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:19,517
You meet the new Russians.

766
01:38:19,643 --> 01:38:22,478
You know how it is. Ex- spies. Now it's Mafia.

767
01:38:22,521 --> 01:38:27,108
Under diplomatic cover.

768
01:38:27,192 --> 01:38:28,818
KGB?

769
01:38:28,944 --> 01:38:30,153
Ex- KGB.

770
01:38:30,321 --> 01:38:34,490
Heavy hitters. Gamblers. Lots of money. Big cars.

771
01:38:34,533 --> 01:38:37,994
They live like Tsars, throw money away.

772
01:38:38,078 --> 01:38:39,537
Fur hats are expensive.

773
01:38:39,622 --> 01:38:40,622
And bodyguards.

774
01:38:40,664 --> 01:38:42,832
Expensive coats. Dr. Zhivago.

775
01:38:44,752 --> 01:38:47,128
l have a lot of work. No time.

776
01:38:49,006 --> 01:38:51,090
l understand.

777
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:54,302
All right. Let's go.

778
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:05,104
lt's going to be fine.

779
01:39:06,023 --> 01:39:08,066
The guy is gonna reach out.

780
01:39:08,150 --> 01:39:09,692
ls he any good?

781
01:39:10,194 --> 01:39:13,321
Jean- Pierre says if it's Russian and it's in Paris...

782
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,418
lf l wanted to find Russians in Paris this week...

783
01:39:28,754 --> 01:39:30,964
l would go to the ice show.

784
01:41:01,513 --> 01:41:03,890
l'll trade you a favor for a cigarette.

785
01:41:05,434 --> 01:41:07,351
The favor is, steer clear of those guys.

786
01:41:07,436 --> 01:41:08,811
The Russians?

787
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:17,445
They sure throw money around here.

788
01:41:33,796 --> 01:41:38,091
The Russian is seeing this Natacha Kirilova, star of the ice show.

789
01:41:38,217 --> 01:41:40,968
He spends every evening in the audience.

790
01:41:43,305 --> 01:41:47,100
- How the hell did you find that out? - We went to high school together.

791
01:42:22,886 --> 01:42:24,887
Mikhi, is everything all right?

792
01:42:24,930 --> 01:42:26,389
Everything is fine.

793
01:42:28,016 --> 01:42:29,475
Sweet girl.

794
01:42:31,562 --> 01:42:33,563
Go. Go on.

795
01:42:51,790 --> 01:42:53,499
Ladies and gentlemen...

796
01:42:53,584 --> 01:42:56,919
we are very proud to present...

797
01:42:56,962 --> 01:43:00,506
two- time Olympic champion...

798
01:43:00,632 --> 01:43:03,634
and three- time world champion...

799
01:43:03,719 --> 01:43:06,721
Natacha Kirilova!

800
01:45:14,224 --> 01:45:15,474
Let's go.

801
01:45:29,072 --> 01:45:30,906
Wait out here.

802
01:45:36,246 --> 01:45:37,621
Yes, he is.

803
01:45:39,958 --> 01:45:41,334
Hello, Mikhi.

804
01:45:41,418 --> 01:45:43,586
The meet is not till later tonight.

805
01:45:43,670 --> 01:45:44,837
The meet is now.

806
01:45:48,925 --> 01:45:50,426
You have the money?

807
01:45:51,136 --> 01:45:55,056
Well, you know, we were going to go back to get it before the meet.

808
01:45:55,098 --> 01:45:56,766
l don't think so.

809
01:45:58,977 --> 01:46:00,728
You have the money?

810
01:46:04,066 --> 01:46:06,901
l might have the money. Where is the case?

811
01:46:08,111 --> 01:46:11,364
No, you have to do it. l couldn't live with myself.

812
01:46:24,628 --> 01:46:26,295
l have the money.

813
01:46:26,380 --> 01:46:29,006
We conclude this now and part friends.

814
01:46:29,591 --> 01:46:30,674
Okay?

815
01:46:33,845 --> 01:46:35,513
Where is the case?

816
01:46:47,859 --> 01:46:49,151
l'd like to be paid now.

817
01:46:54,658 --> 01:46:55,908
No doubt.

818
01:47:01,915 --> 01:47:03,999
Now tell me the other part.

819
01:47:05,001 --> 01:47:06,544
The other part?

820
01:47:07,295 --> 01:47:08,671
l'm leaving.

821
01:47:09,172 --> 01:47:11,590
l'm taking my fee and l'm leaving.

822
01:47:13,802 --> 01:47:16,887
l have a person with a rifle in the stadium.

823
01:47:17,264 --> 01:47:20,433
l've worked with her for years. She never misses.

824
01:47:20,892 --> 01:47:22,309
l will call.

825
01:47:22,936 --> 01:47:26,647
l have to call within 45 seconds to say that l'm leaving.

826
01:47:27,607 --> 01:47:30,985
And then in another 10 minutes to say that l'm safe.

827
01:47:32,696 --> 01:47:36,031
Should l be unable to call, your friend will be shot.

828
01:47:46,835 --> 01:47:48,043
30 seconds, Mikhi.

829
01:47:49,463 --> 01:47:50,921
We have to see somebody inside.

830
01:47:51,006 --> 01:47:52,673
You can't pass without badges.

831
01:47:59,431 --> 01:48:00,806
20 seconds.

832
01:48:11,902 --> 01:48:12,985
10 seconds.

833
01:48:42,140 --> 01:48:46,477
There were two of them. They were looking for those guys.

834
01:48:46,686 --> 01:48:49,063
Just a minute, sir.

835
01:49:05,622 --> 01:49:09,291
l am a Chilean citizen, as you can see from my passport.

836
01:49:51,626 --> 01:49:52,793
Mama!

837
01:50:16,901 --> 01:50:18,402
Stay with him.

838
01:50:51,227 --> 01:50:52,978
Get out of here! Get out of here!

839
01:50:54,022 --> 01:50:57,274
Get out of the car. Walk away! Walk away! Walk away!

840
01:50:57,942 --> 01:50:58,984
Go. Go.

841
01:51:00,070 --> 01:51:01,945
- l will if you will. - Just go.

842
01:51:02,405 --> 01:51:04,573
Come with me. Forget about the case.

843
01:51:09,537 --> 01:51:12,665
l didn't come for the case. l came for your boss.

844
01:51:13,124 --> 01:51:15,751
l came for Seamus. l came for him.

845
01:51:17,587 --> 01:51:18,921
Just get out of here.

846
01:51:19,005 --> 01:51:21,006
l never left. Don't you see?

847
01:51:24,886 --> 01:51:26,595
Get out of the way!

848
01:51:33,900 --> 01:51:35,400
Get out of the way!

849
01:51:35,605 --> 01:51:37,272
You can't pass this way. lt's blocked.

850
01:52:04,175 --> 01:52:06,719
l can take you in or leave you here.

851
01:52:08,138 --> 01:52:09,346
There. That's him with the case.

852
01:52:09,431 --> 01:52:12,391
- Sir, over here, please. - Wait, wait.

853
01:52:20,024 --> 01:52:23,068
There are more back there!

854
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:02,983
All right. Stay where you are! Don't move.

855
01:53:03,026 --> 01:53:05,986
Shut your fucking mouth up! Shut your mouth!

856
01:53:20,710 --> 01:53:22,294
You stupid shite.

857
01:53:22,712 --> 01:53:24,379
You're a dead man.

858
01:53:47,987 --> 01:53:50,239
This is the BBC World Service.

859
01:53:50,615 --> 01:53:53,033
It was announced today, after almost 30 years

860
01:53:53,076 --> 01:53:56,787
of bIoody and seemingIy intractabIe civil conflict in Northern lreland

861
01:53:56,871 --> 01:53:58,580
that a peace agreement has been reached

862
01:53:58,623 --> 01:54:02,209
between the predominantIy Protestant government of that British- ruIed encIave

863
01:54:02,252 --> 01:54:04,002
and the lrish resistance.

864
01:54:09,467 --> 01:54:11,844
...have told CNN that it was the apprehension

865
01:54:11,928 --> 01:54:13,303
and sIaying in France

866
01:54:13,388 --> 01:54:17,599
of the lrish terrorist Seamus O'Rourke by parties stiII unknown

867
01:54:17,642 --> 01:54:21,353
that contributed a stabiIity, IargeIy aIIowing the negotiations

868
01:54:21,437 --> 01:54:24,231
to proceed to their historic concIusion today.

869
01:54:24,274 --> 01:54:26,275
O'Rourke had earlier been denounced

870
01:54:26,317 --> 01:54:29,361
by the lRA, the military wing of Sinn Fein,

871
01:54:29,445 --> 01:54:31,780
as a rogue breakaway operative.

872
01:54:34,450 --> 01:54:38,078
Well then, good knowing you.

873
01:54:51,050 --> 01:54:53,051
- l'm sorry? - You said something.

874
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:56,471
l said she would not be coming back here.

875
01:54:58,516 --> 01:54:59,600
Yeah.

876
01:55:01,436 --> 01:55:04,146
She would not be coming back here, would she?

877
01:55:09,235 --> 01:55:12,654
l can't even put my hand in my pocket to pay the bill.

878
01:55:12,739 --> 01:55:14,156
l'll get it.

879
01:55:17,160 --> 01:55:18,994
l'll get the next one.

880
01:55:24,834 --> 01:55:26,627
What was in the case?

881
01:55:27,503 --> 01:55:29,129
l don't remember.

882
01:55:30,173 --> 01:55:31,840
Lesson number two.

883
01:55:33,343 --> 01:55:34,843
Keep in touch.

884
01:55:54,447 --> 01:55:55,697
Let's go.

885
01:56:08,586 --> 01:56:10,921
No questions. No answers.

886
01:56:11,589 --> 01:56:13,799
That's the business we're in.

887
01:56:14,175 --> 01:56:16,218
You accept it and move on.

888
01:56:17,553 --> 01:56:19,930
Maybe that's Iesson number three.
