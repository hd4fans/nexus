1
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:14,304
--an unprecedented meteor shower
falling off the coast of Tokyo.

2
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:18,434
The entire city is mesmerised
by this incredible sight.

3
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:20,894
Two hours after the first contact...

4
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:24,106
...an unidentified enemy
has reached our coastlines...

5
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:27,443
...in a swift and militaristic attack.

6
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:34,283
Right now, one thing is clear:
The world is at war.

7
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,133
At 14:46 Pacific Standard Time...

8
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:54,053
...12 different locations
across the globe were breached...

9
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,723
...in a coordinated attack
by an unknown enemy.

10
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:01,560
All breaches were
along the coastline...

11
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,271
...in what is a campaign
of rapid dominance.

12
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:07,191
This is a textbook military invasion.

13
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,235
There are massive casualties
in New York.

14
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,655
Defensive lines
are being set up in Boston.

15
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:17,534
And at 13:15 Zulu time,
we lost communications...

16
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,995
...with San Francisco and San Diego.

17
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,413
Their status is unknown.

18
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:27,753
What we know is that we are the last
offensive force on the West Coast.

19
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,881
We cannot lose Los Angeles.

20
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:38,472
We have five birds down
two klicks west of CP Victory.

21
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,975
We're hit, we're hit! Tighten
your asses, we're going down!

22
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,852
Command and control is down.

23
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,313
Civilians in need of support
two klicks northeast.

24
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,857
Cables inbound.
Engage your sectors of fire, over.

25
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,069
Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit.

26
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:25,185
Good morning. 94.5 with the Surfrider
Foundation Morning Surf Report.

27
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:29,565
Surfers, hard northeast conditions
blowing out there...

28
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:34,278
...the ocean slopping and chopping.
There is some size starting to build....

29
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,655
Come on. Come on.

30
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,427
-Morning, staff sergeant.
-Morning, sergeant.

31
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,178
Morning, staff sergeant.

32
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,598
-Morning, sergeant.
-Morning, staff sergeant.

33
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,641
Morning, staff sergeant.

34
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,442
Morning, you little prick.

35
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:32,628
You know what they say. You're only
as old as you feel, staff sergeant.

36
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:36,590
That's what I'm worried about.
I can't feel a damn thing.

37
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:45,807
--to the Pacific for our next report,
where a cluster of meteors...

38
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:51,521
...is predicted to enter our atmosphere
in the early hours tomorrow morning.

39
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:52,773
Go ahead.

40
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:56,985
They're expected to strike miles
from land, far into the Pacific Ocean.

41
00:03:58,237 --> 00:04:00,447
-John.
-Oh, God.

42
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,200
What's up, Mike?

43
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:07,371
Hey. What happened to that picture
of us in Iraq with that camel?

44
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,289
I mean, your girlfriend.

45
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,458
Hey, is this for real?

46
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:15,545
It's got your signature. l said, "That's
gotta be a mistake. He can't write."

47
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:19,675
No mistake, John. l did my 20.
I know when to get out.

48
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:23,261
Come on. You got the box full of
medals, a file full of commendations.

49
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:26,098
You can have them.
Seems you like interior decorating.

50
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:30,060
A Marine's got a shelf life, you know?
After that....

51
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:31,561
What? He spoils?

52
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,355
Something like that.

53
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:36,191
I'll finish my training assignment
with these Marines.

54
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,985
Get them combat ready.

55
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,654
And then I'll be on my merry way.

56
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:44,992
You know, we could always use
another lean, mean typing machine.

57
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,994
Shit, I ain't built like you, John.

58
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,329
Ugly, slow, soft.

59
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,792
God.

60
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:57,087
You had to make some
tough calls there, Mike.

61
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,466
Especially that last one.

62
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,512
We all wish your men made it home.

63
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,433
Here we go.

64
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,693
You're expired.

65
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,361
Clear the shelf...

66
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,947
...staff sergeant.

67
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:38,128
Everything I know is in here, John.

68
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:00,358
What typically would have been
detected months, if not years, before...

69
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,694
...surfaced in less than four hours.

70
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:06,782
These images giving some idea of
the rate these meteors are travelling.

71
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,827
Scientists are abuzz,
scrambling to try and understand it.

72
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,330
There's something just
extremely uncomfortable...

73
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,832
...about a man your size
sniffing a flower.

74
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,959
What you want is some hydrangeas.

75
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,837
Popular wedding flower,
come in green, blue.

76
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,423
What colour is
the bridesmaids' dresses?

77
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:28,637
-Good question.
-You're amazing. Take a whiff. Smell it.

78
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,348
Yes, pretty girl?

79
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:35,227
For 300 more, she said we could have
sprays of lilies.

80
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:38,688
Now, l know it's a lot, but it'd be
so beautiful. What do you think?

81
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,482
300 dollars? Goodness gracious.

82
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:44,611
It's a no-brainer. You're only getting
married once. Worry about 300 bucks?

83
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,781
-Thank you, Stavrou. Thank you.
-Yeah, no worries.

84
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:53,203
You know what? lt's your day.
Do whatever you want.

85
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,541
I'm gonna hit you with something.
What are you doing?

86
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,792
Busting your balls.

87
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,502
Tomorrow we shop for cakes.

88
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,546
And l can't wait.

89
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:03,922
I love cake.

90
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,186
Yo, Doc. What you doing?

91
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,437
Skyping back home.

92
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,524
Is that your girlfriend? Damn, she fine.

93
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,527
Doc. My boy.

94
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,033
That's my sister.

95
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,829
Goddamn.

96
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:40,041
Shoot, man. I'm speaking objectively
here, you know what I'm saying?

97
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,169
All right, no, stop playing!

98
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,255
May I take a message?

99
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:47,757
Doc, is it all right
if l have one of those first?

100
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,220
You eat it at your own risk.

101
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:55,599
They're very old.

102
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,728
So do you feel
that you're making progress?

103
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:03,607
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

104
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,443
I'm sleeping a lot better.

105
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,279
And then also around the firing range
and everything...

106
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,990
...when I first came back
and hear the pop, pop, pop...

107
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,827
...I'd get jumpy and it would mess with
me a bit and a little bit of a setback.

108
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,079
But now it, you know...

109
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,832
...doesn't bother me.

110
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,792
So l think that's progress.

111
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,379
So, what's the story
with my status, doc?

112
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,466
I mean, are you gonna clear me
for combat? Because....

113
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,551
Yeah, l feel good.

114
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,514
Let's meet again next week...

115
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,644
...and we'll discuss it. Okay?

116
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,982
All right, thank you.
Thank you very much, doc.

117
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,952
Harris' girl is making the dude
organise his entire wedding...

118
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,578
...two weeks before we deploy.

119
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:03,500
I say the chick's busting his balls
like nobody's business.

120
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,213
But he got two weeks to get it done
because we're out.

121
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:11,883
So l just came by to visit you
one last time before we leave.

122
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:16,513
And l brought Dad's five iron with me.
And you know what that means.

123
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:21,601
Me and the boys are gonna
go out tonight, continue the tradition.

124
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,562
Have a good time, you know?

125
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,233
I'll see you soon, bro.

126
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,281
See you soon.

127
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:39,619
Motown, give me boots.
I'm going skiing.

128
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,371
Oh, that's how you do it, baby.

129
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,583
Here they come.

130
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:48,753
Don't mess this up, man.
They cannot know that you a virgin.

131
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,548
How do you know l--
Who says I'm a virgin?

132
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,383
We know you are. Look at your face.

133
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:55,969
What are you telling her?
Telling her what?

134
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,848
Oh, come on, you guys.
You're killing me.

135
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,936
That dog gonna hunt! Damn, Daktari,
you can play, man.

136
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,397
We have courses in Nigeria, Imlay.

137
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:11,568
Shit. How am l supposed to know,
man? It's an American game, right?

138
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,112
Adukwu's our Navy corpsman.
He's like a medic.

139
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:17,532
No, not like a medic. Medic is
the Army. I'm a Navy corpsman.

140
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,659
Well, sailor, yes.

141
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,369
I came here to become a doctor.

142
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,792
Slow down.

143
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,503
That's like number five.

144
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,047
How many have you had?

145
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,590
No, I'm good.

146
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,052
-Now, this guy here, Mr. Lenihan...
-Hey.

147
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:40,013
...his mom signed
so he could join up at 17.

148
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,892
And l look after him because this boy
don't know his ass from a hot rock.

149
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:52,525
-Not on my truck, dude!
-Easy, now. Easy, buddy.

150
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,861
-Oh, yeah!
-Not on my truck.

151
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:58,114
-Toast. To Lenihan.
-To Lenihan!

152
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,908
Good luck, rookie.

153
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,326
Retreat, hell!

154
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:04,746
--emergency developing throughout
NASA and the space community.

155
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:09,042
We now know that meteors will land
off the coasts of eight different cities...

156
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,127
...and that number could keep rising.

157
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,214
Evacuations now under way
in Southern California...

158
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,716
...moving the population back
from the coastline.

159
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,053
But a lot of curious people
are clamouring for views.

160
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:25,600
-What are you doing up so early?
-Lieutenant. Still gotta get used to that.

161
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,980
This thing right?

162
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,233
-Here. You want me to do it?
-lt's tricky.

163
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:38,154
They gotta be parallel to the deck.
That's the whole thing with these bars.

164
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,615
-Don't forget to call Mr. Gilliam, okay?
-Okay.

165
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,534
-Call me later.
-I'll call you later.

166
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,124
That's my baby. All right.

167
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,602
Let's go! Move!

168
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,277
Quick time! March!

169
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:25,493
Marines! lnto the trucks and report
to your company! Let's go!

170
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,036
Move it! Let's move!

171
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,705
Move it!

172
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,458
-Load them up!
-Move it!

173
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,793
What's going on, first sergeant?

174
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,589
Meteors hitting off California now...

175
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,884
...but they got the whole
goddamn base being mobilised.

176
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:45,513
I'm bringing you back to the company,
Mike. They need you.

177
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,724
First sergeant.

178
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:52,145
All hands on deck, staff sergeant.

179
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,902
-You heard we might be mobilising?
-Yes, sir.

180
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,528
Moving you up to squad leader.

181
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,989
It's a big responsibility,
but you can handle it.

182
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,532
Thank you, sir.

183
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:08,286
Staff Sergeant Beck is being replaced
by Staff Sergeant Nantz.

184
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,206
What do you know about him?

185
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,501
He's a very dedicated Marine.

186
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,045
Don't bullshit me, corporal.

187
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,881
What'd you hear about his last tour?

188
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:23,760
Just the grimy details
that everybody else already knows.

189
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,721
But at the end of the day,
you're our lieutenant...

190
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,224
...and we take our orders from you, sir.

191
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:36,648
You're assigned to 1st Platoon
under Second Lieutenant Martinez.

192
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:41,736
His platoon sergeant's on leave,
so you're gonna have to suck it up.

193
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,573
Yeah, so, here's the lieutenant
right up here, 1 o'clock.

194
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,158
He's a kid, Mike.

195
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,577
Right out of officer training school.

196
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,413
He's only been with us a month,
but I think he's sharp.

197
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:56,793
It's just an evacuation, buddy.
He's in charge.

198
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,546
Just keep an eye on him, huh?

199
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,551
Just don't lose my paperwork.

200
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,595
-Lieutenant.
-Good afternoon, staff sergeant.

201
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,597
-Happy to meet you.
-Thank you, sir.

202
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:13,768
We're being called in to help with
an evacuation? For these meteors?

203
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,436
I assume so.

204
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:18,356
Whatever it is, I'm happy to finally
get out in the field.

205
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,942
At approximately 4:42 am
Pacific Standard Time...

206
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,527
...the meteors impacted....

207
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,488
Who the hell took my tortellini?
You got tortellini?

208
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,823
This some kind of drill?

209
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:30,451
Get ready, man. Get ready.
It's serious. Okay?

210
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:38,042
Meteors continue to fall off the coast
of California, Ireland, Bay of Bengal....

211
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,294
Corporal. Corporal.

212
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,045
-Corporal. Corporal.
-Yeah?

213
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,089
It's probably just a training exercise.

214
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,467
No, man. They're shifting Nantz
into our unit. Something's going on.

215
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:49,762
The guy wants out of the Marine
Corps and now we're stuck with him.

216
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,723
-Stavs!
-You got tortellini?

217
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,767
I heard Nantz kicked ass his last tour.

218
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,645
He went into that compound alone
and killed 10 insurgents.

219
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,565
-That's what you heard, Lenihan?
-Chill out.

220
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,276
Yeah. Johnson in Foxtrot told me
that he was going on--

221
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,736
Don't worry about it.

222
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,655
-Let's go, this is serious.
-What the hell did l do?

223
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,991
Nantz got a couple guys killed
on his last tour.

224
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,242
What?

225
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,620
That's the story.
Lockett's brother was one.

226
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:18,124
So l know you didn't know, but
just don't-- No, don't worry about it.

227
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,835
Looks like we're getting into
some heavy shit.

228
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,756
It's been my experience, lieutenant,
heavy shit is highly overrated.

229
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:28,343
Look, staff sergeant, let's just be clear.

230
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,678
I know your rep,
know what you've done.

231
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,306
This is my platoon.
These are my men.

232
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:36,768
-Not gonna have a problem, are we?
-No problem, sir. She's all yours.

233
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:40,188
It appears our initial assumptions
were wrong.

234
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,692
Listen up!
Once you get your weapon...

235
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:48,529
...get your gear, get your munitions,
move outside!

236
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:54,035
We got white chocolate rap from my
man. That should finish the new mix?

237
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:57,664
National Guard troops have flown in
to evacuate beach areas...

238
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:01,709
...and we have word
the military is now deploying.

239
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,879
That's us. That's us! That's us!

240
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:08,466
-Calling military for a meteor shower?
-l don't know why they're happy.

241
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,301
--a meteor that just hit the ocean.

242
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:15,515
Large plumes of smoke are coming
up. Visibility is getting worse as we....

243
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,934
These objects were
completely undetected...

244
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,894
...until they entered our atmosphere.

245
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:23,481
NASA estimates that they are not
hitting the water at terminal velocity.

246
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,317
They're slowing down before impact.

247
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,407
These objects are falling into
the ocean in tightly packed clusters...

248
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:35,451
...10 miles outside
of a major population centre.

249
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,662
Thermal imaging
from the Hubble shows us...

250
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:41,666
...that within each cluster is a central
object much larger than the others.

251
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:45,002
Now, these central objects
are all the same geometric shape.

252
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,547
They appear mechanical in nature.

253
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,341
This is not a meteor shower, Marines.

254
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,511
We are in Threatcon Delta.
That's right.

255
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:57,014
Come on. All units, gear up.

256
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,766
Be ready to move.

257
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:00,852
Combat situation.

258
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,146
It's what I've been training for.

259
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:09,277
l am told that one of the Coast Guard
cutters has issued a mayday.

260
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,946
lt is difficult to see, and--
Oh, my gosh!

261
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,700
There is just another meteor
that just hit the ocean...

262
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:18,661
...and it's the closest one yet,
right behind those cutters.

263
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,205
Two or three meteors just impacted.

264
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,374
Shit.

265
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,919
Do you have any more information
in the studio? Oh, my God.

266
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:31,132
Kate? Kate? Are you hearing us?

267
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:36,137
-Shut up, shut up, shut up!
-Kate, are you still hearing us?

268
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:40,850
Yes, Jean, I can hear you. Everyone,
move out. Get out of the way.

269
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,269
What is that?
What is that in the water?

270
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,564
I can't really get a good look,
but it appears there's something--

271
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:50,651
I'm looking through the people, trying
to determine exactly what this is.

272
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:54,697
I don't even know.
It's like shadowy figures.

273
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,743
Maybe five, six, seven.
I can make out maybe eight figures.

274
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,205
-What the hell is that?
-Holy shit!

275
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,249
-Look at that!
-Stavs, you see that?

276
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:09,128
I'm gonna head back now. Everyone
needs to get out of here right now.

277
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:19,138
I think that we've gotta leave, Jean.
I'm gonna head back now.

278
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,390
Oh, my God!

279
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,438
Go! Let's go. Go, go!

280
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,650
Corporal Grayston and Corporal lmlay
are both expert marksmen...

281
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,860
...as well as strong fire team leaders.

282
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,947
We also have PFC Lenihan,
who is our second best marksman...

283
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:40,326
-...behind Lance Corporal Guerrero.
-What's your take on this, Specs?

284
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,995
I don't know. Extraterrestrial?

285
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,289
-Do you mean like from space?
-No, Imlay.

286
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,792
-From Canada.
-Always got jokes, don't you, Stav?

287
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:50,670
All right, first squad, line it up.
Bring it in. Let's go!

288
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,881
As you may have heard...

289
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:57,343
...Staff Sergeant Nantz will be
taking over for Staff Sergeant Beck.

290
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,554
We're lucky to have him aboard.

291
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:03,891
All right. Here's the situation, Marines.
We're facing an unknown enemy.

292
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,937
We don't know how strong their
force is or what they're capable of.

293
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:11,732
But one thing we do know
is that we're fighting for our land...

294
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:15,403
...our families, our home
and our country, goddamn it!

295
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,948
Whatever those things are, let's show
them how Marines fight. Retreat....

296
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,157
-Hell!
-Two-Five!

297
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,326
-Retreat, hell!
-Let's form it up, let's go!

298
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,340
First in, last out, Marines!

299
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:40,094
Breathe, Lenihan. Breathe.
Your training will kick in.

300
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,221
Thank you, staff sergeant!

301
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,851
-Got something to get off your chest?
-No, it's cool, staff sergeant.

302
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,104
You got a silver star, my brother
came home in a box. I get it.

303
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:56,068
All stations, this net.
Standby for sitrep.

304
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,571
Enemy elements have advanced
beyond the beach.

305
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,617
Aliens? That's not possible, right?

306
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,411
We'll know soon enough, brother.

307
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:10,166
One-oh-one tank has been destroyed.
Company beyond the defensive line....

308
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:14,337
It's in case his head gets blown off,
so they can identify his body.

309
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,716
Be advised, enemy have
heavy assault weapons.

310
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,594
Firepower equal
to high-explosive rounds.

311
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:28,392
Hey, staff sergeant! Promise me
you won't let me be taken alive...

312
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:32,146
...by some godless predator
from another world, staff sergeant?

313
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,900
No promises in combat.

314
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,487
Stop screwing around
and keep your head in it!

315
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:45,660
These units are falling tactically.
Their strategies are coordinated.

316
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:48,955
Do not underestimate enemy
combat intelligence.

317
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,089
We are not evacuating civilians
fast enough.

318
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,675
I say again, we are not evacuating
fast enough.

319
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:06,222
All units be advised, there are
friendlies behind enemy lines.

320
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:09,266
Semper Fi, 1-7 Actual, out.

321
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,052
You gotta take me to dinner first, baby.

322
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,930
Boys, hold on to something.
Things are about to get rough.

323
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,893
Let's go, let's go, let's go! Out! Go!

324
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,529
Move, move, move!

325
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,116
Form it up!

326
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,543
-What do we got, sir?
-All right, situation is as follows:

327
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:02,213
Most of Santa Monica's
been cleared of civilians.

328
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:06,008
We got a defensive line at Lincoln
Boulevard a mile from the ocean.

329
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,637
Air Force has got Warthogs
and B-52s on deck.

330
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:15,184
At 1930 hours, they will pound the
entire area from Lincoln to the ocean.

331
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,228
Shit.

332
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,107
We're levelling Santa Monica, sir?

333
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:23,567
We got an infestation
of God knows what...

334
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,737
...not of this Earth and
we gotta hit them with everything...

335
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:30,199
...and we gotta hit them hard.
They are a ground-force enemy only.

336
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:33,702
They have no aircraft, so the Air Force
will tear them a new asshole...

337
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,663
...and we will rule the air.

338
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,915
-You said "most civilians," sir?
-Affirmed.

339
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,417
Getting distress calls,
sending squads out.

340
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:43,587
Golf, you take Santa Monica
to Olympic.

341
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,965
Foxtrot, Olympic to Pico.

342
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,342
Echo, Pico to Ocean Park.

343
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,095
Lieutenant Martinez,
I want you to break off a squad...

344
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,471
...and a machine gun team.

345
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:56,600
Proceed west from Lincoln
to a police station located here...

346
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,978
-...at Venice and Amarosa.
-Venice and Amarosa.

347
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,563
Police were overrun.

348
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:05,234
Got a distress call that civilians are
still there. We don't know how many.

349
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,486
Just gather survivors,
then you radio in.

350
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,573
We'll have helicopters
in the area to evacuate you out.

351
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:14,618
Now, be advised, you got exactly
three hours before our bombs drop.

352
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,913
And make no mistake, they will drop,
with or without you.

353
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,457
Get those civilians,
get the hell out of there...

354
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,961
...and you kill anything
that is not human.

355
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,297
Let's go! Let's get it done!

356
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:29,925
Captain, this is not a drill. You hold
that line, you understand me?

357
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,177
Yes, sir.

358
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:43,647
--from the coastline into suburbs.
Golf company is overrun.

359
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,192
Lima company
requesting immediate air support.

360
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:49,445
Civilians are being stranded
behind enemy lines.

361
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,988
Hang on, One!

362
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,656
Fire in the hole!

363
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:10,799
Troops are amassing in every coast,
along every major coastline.

364
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,927
The UN has called
an emergency sitting...

365
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,971
...in an attempt to establish
a means for sharing resources...

366
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,098
...and intelligence across the globe.

367
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:19,934
Watch out, go!

368
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,730
This way?
Where are we supposed to go?

369
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,566
Jesus Christ.

370
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:42,831
Marines, anything beyond this point,
consider to be hostile.

371
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,667
All right, nice and easy.

372
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,095
Clear.

373
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,975
Hell of a way to earn your citizenship.

374
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,519
Shit. I'd rather be in Afghanistan.

375
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:07,606
Lieutenant. How many civilians
we gotta get out of that police station?

376
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:10,818
I have no idea, Guerrero.
Just stay focused.

377
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,618
-What the hell's that? What is that?
-This is insane.

378
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,328
Yo, eyes open.

379
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:24,373
An unidentified enemy
has breached our coastlines...

380
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:27,209
...in a swift and militaristic attack.

381
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,462
At this point, there are many more
questions than answers.

382
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:35,009
Right now, one thing is clear:
The world is at war.

383
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,594
Eyes open.

384
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,974
You see something, Simmons?

385
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,435
Can't see shit.

386
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:50,482
-Kerns, you see a cross street?
-Lieutenant, I don't see nothing.

387
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:54,111
Police station's
about one klick northwest of here.

388
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,438
-Twelve o'clock!
-Hundred metres front.

389
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:32,566
-This is Echo 6, we need immediate--
-Turn your radios down.

390
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:45,329
-lt's just a dog.
-Just a little doggy. Come here.

391
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:46,663
-lt's just a dog.
-Dog.

392
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:47,998
-Dog.
-Dog.

393
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,292
What's his name, huh? "Glenn."

394
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,795
Kidding me. Who's the idiot
naming dogs these days?

395
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,880
What do you wanna call him, Fido?

396
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,007
Watch out!

397
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,016
-Where's it coming from?
-l don't know.

398
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,726
Lenihan, watch your head!

399
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,103
On the roof!

400
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,525
Enemy fire! Eleven o'clock!

401
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:17,528
-They're on the roof! On the roof!
-Cover him!

402
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:24,868
Twenty-five metres!
Twenty-five metres!

403
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:29,164
-Lieutenant!
-Left flank, on the roof!

404
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,291
Covering, covering!

405
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,920
-We gotta move now!
-Lockett!

406
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,256
-Yes?
-Get me an exit down that alley!

407
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:40,259
Yes, sergeant!
Kerns, Motown, let's go!

408
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,431
Get up! Come on!

409
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,015
Falling back!

410
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,642
Let's go, come on!

411
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,936
Enemy fire! Watch your head!

412
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,355
-Where'd they come from?
-Fall back!

413
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,607
Enemy fire, keep your head down!

414
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,151
It's all over the damn place!

415
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,444
What do you see?

416
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,362
I don't know, man. I don't see shit.

417
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:01,989
How do we get out of here?

418
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:04,491
-Lieutenant, where's the exit?
-I'm working on it!

419
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,703
-Shit, we're boxed in!
-I'll take a position by the wall! Go, go!

420
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,705
-Move out!
-Ambush!

421
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,333
I don't have him!

422
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:14,835
I'm hit!

423
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,546
Cover me, Lockett!

424
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:31,310
-Man down, man down!
-lt burns!

425
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,148
Shit!

426
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,484
I got you, Guerrero!

427
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:47,576
Lieutenant! Lieutenant!

428
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,249
I've got you covered!

429
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,127
We have an exit!
Everybody, move out! Move out!

430
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,378
Move, move!

431
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:02,633
Staff sergeant, we got an exit! Come
on, we're going! Come on, let's go!

432
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:11,683
Fall back, fall back!

433
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,944
Go, keep moving! Keep moving!

434
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,240
Lorenzo!

435
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:27,658
Move, move, move!

436
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:30,118
Keep moving, keep moving,
keep moving!

437
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,330
I can't see shit!

438
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:39,461
Shit, shit, shit!
Imlay!

439
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,672
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

440
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,466
U.S. Marines, coming in!

441
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,760
U.S. Marines, anybody in here?

442
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,471
Kitchen's clear!
The kitchen's clear, lieutenant!

443
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,848
Get on that window! Are we clear?

444
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:54,434
Put the wounded in the kitchen!

445
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,812
Kerns, Lockett, secure the back
of this house.

446
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,439
-Yes, staff sergeant.
-Staff sergeant, we're on it!

447
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,611
Doc, how long
till they're able to move?

448
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:07,197
Ten minutes. Ten minutes,
staff sergeant. Ten minutes.

449
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:10,200
You want me?
Come get some! I'm right here!

450
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,868
What do we got, lmlay?

451
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,288
I got nothing.
I can't see a goddamn thing.

452
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,832
-With this smoke, it's zero visibility.
-You're dead!

453
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,292
Stow that shit, Simmons!

454
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:20,919
You'll get shot before
you're able to kill any of them.

455
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:22,170
Your orders, sir?

456
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:26,091
I led us right into that ambush.

457
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:29,428
-Mottola, anyone on command?
-No, sir.

458
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:33,974
-We need to find answers to get out.
-You're in charge, sir. Your orders?

459
00:31:38,896 --> 00:31:40,439
Let's radio that evac to meet us.

460
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,816
Civilians or no,
we gotta get these wounded out.

461
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:45,360
-Roger that.
-Hey, guys, guys. Where's Lenihan?

462
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:47,654
I didn't see him with us. Where is he?

463
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:48,905
-Lenihan?
-Lenihan?

464
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,532
Anybody got eyes on Lenihan?

465
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,868
-Lenihan!
-I'll go for Lenihan, sir.

466
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:56,163
Imlay, Harris, on me.
Let's get this shit out of here.

467
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,665
I'll package the wounded.
Rally on 10th Street.

468
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,209
Be prepared to move.
We're moving out soon.

469
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,004
Shit.

470
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,014
Mottorola.

471
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,266
Mottorola?

472
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,896
Oh, come on. Mottorola, you copy?

473
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,356
Lenihan, where are you?

474
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:23,982
Staff sergeant?

475
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:27,903
Jesus Christ. l had to turn my radio
off. These things are everywhere.

476
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,197
We're coming for you.
What's your location?

477
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:33,659
I'm in the laundry room
of some apartment complex.

478
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,619
It's like three storeys--

479
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:49,216
What colour is it? Lenihan. Lenihan?

480
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,067
Shit.

481
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:16,827
Lenihan.

482
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,833
Shit.

483
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,136
So smooth....

484
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,431
Smooth is fast.

485
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,474
Shit.

486
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,150
Oh, shit.

487
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,161
-Lenihan!
-Lenihan, lower that weapon!

488
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,873
What the hell--?

489
00:34:54,091 --> 00:34:55,884
Keep on firing!

490
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:00,305
Jesus Christ!
What the hell is that thing?

491
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:03,934
It's not dead. They don't die. I've hit it
a hundred times. They don't die.

492
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:07,354
Get separated from the unit again,
I'll find you and shoot you myself.

493
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:10,148
Imlay, drop a grenade in that pool.
Let's move!

494
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,359
Come on, l got you. l got you.

495
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:14,903
Frag out.

496
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,750
Street's clear.

497
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:31,670
Get down, get down, get down.

498
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:35,715
-What's happening? What's going on?
-All right, we're good. Come on.

499
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:43,098
-lt's Lenihan.
-Yo, Lockett.

500
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:47,561
You owe me $5. l told you, a virgin
ain't gonna die till he get him some.

501
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,437
Move to the police station?

502
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,899
-All right, let's move. Let's move.
-Move it. Move it out.

503
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:08,248
-Where'd that come from?
-Door's open at the bank!

504
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:09,749
Take care of him.

505
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,251
Where'd the shot come from?

506
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,254
-Kerns!
-Door's open on the bank! Let's move!

507
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:17,132
Come on, let's go! Move! Move it!

508
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:21,636
Stavrou, you got front. Stavrou,
cover front. Harris, cover front!

509
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,264
Roof's clear, roof's clear!

510
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,682
I got it. I got it covered.

511
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,393
Harris! Find me where
that shot came from, guys!

512
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,687
Imlay, get eyes up on that roof,
all right?

513
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:33,189
-Cover the roof!
-Roof's clear, roof's clear!

514
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,608
Lockett, on me!

515
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:36,902
Did anybody even see
where that came from?

516
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,613
Doc, how serious?

517
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:42,616
Third degree thermal burns
on his neck and his face, sir.

518
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,619
You'll be surfing soon, Simmons.

519
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,370
Shit.

520
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,501
-Hostiles, 12 o'clock!
-Hostiles at 12 o'clock!

521
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,795
Staff sergeant, hostiles, 12 o'clock!

522
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,173
Prepare to fire!

523
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,634
Hold it, hold it!

524
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,385
Friendlies, sir.

525
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:07,223
-Shit.
-Friendlies. Let's get them in.

526
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,436
Get over here.

527
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:18,234
Move. Move to the back.
Let's go. Come on, get.

528
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:22,238
-What's your unit?
-40th, lD.

529
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,074
Where's the rest of your unit?

530
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:26,660
Everyone else is either dead
or missing.

531
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,454
I picked up Air Force here.

532
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,831
Tech Sergeant Elena Santos,
Air Force.

533
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:36,211
61st Wing, intel, surveillance,
recon division.

534
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,588
Tech sergeant? What the hell
are you doing here?

535
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:42,384
We were tracking enemy transmissions
about 12 klicks south of here.

536
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,011
They ambushed us
like they knew our freaking address.

537
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,472
I'm the only one left.

538
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:51,559
I found these guys on the way to the
safe zone at Santa Monica Airport.

539
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:54,437
You ready to use that weapon,
tech sergeant?

540
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:58,817
With all due respect, staff sergeant,
I didn't get this far off of my good looks.

541
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,902
-I'm ready for payback.
-Outstanding.

542
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:05,156
Lieutenant, bird inbound,
25 minutes, sir.

543
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:08,368
Roger that.
Let's get to that police station.

544
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:11,162
All right, let's get Simmons and move.
Let's go!

545
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:18,753
Cover our flanks, Mottorola!
To the right, in that building!

546
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,046
Watch your feet!

547
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,548
There's the police station.

548
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,551
Let's get those civilians
and get back to the F.O.B.!

549
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:28,930
Gotta rock, gotta rock!

550
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,021
Come on, come on, come on.

551
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,024
I'll stay with our wounded,
wait for the medevac.

552
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,860
I'll go for civilians.
Kerns, Dever, on me.

553
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:45,071
-Mags, mags. I need mags.
-All right.

554
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:49,034
Santos, when that bird arrives,
I'll need your help on this stretcher.

555
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,661
U.S. Marines! U.S. Marines!

556
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:54,831
Door. The door.

557
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:56,791
-Elevator right.
-Clear!

558
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,501
Elevator right.

559
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:01,755
Second elevator, clear! No pulse.

560
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,716
Door left.

561
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:06,468
It's locked.

562
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:07,969
-What's your name?
-Harper.

563
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,014
-I'm gonna need you on this stretcher.
-Bird incoming, sir!

564
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,975
Roger that. lmlay, pop smoke!

565
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,231
-Door locked.
-Door left.

566
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,527
Radios off.

567
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,372
Move.

568
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,945
U.S. Marines! U.S. Marines!

569
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,907
-How many of you?
-Five of us, three kids.

570
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,659
Kerns, kids!

571
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,704
-Let's move!
-Let's go, let's go!

572
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,833
All right, let's get ready to move!
Let's get it up!

573
00:40:22,419 --> 00:40:24,170
-Here we go! Let's move!
-Aye, sir!

574
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,173
We got room for four and that is it!
That is it.

575
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,717
-Get your wounded on! Move it!
-Oh, yeah, baby.

576
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:32,095
Come on. Come on. Get up. Get up.

577
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:33,972
Get him in. Hey, Guerrero.

578
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,475
I'll work on that mix for you!

579
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:41,104
I'm gonna need it, dude! You're
gonna be fine! You're gonna be fine!

580
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:42,856
Give them hell!

581
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:46,609
-Oh, shit.
-Come on, man.

582
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:50,029
You just had to get out of the shit.

583
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,031
-You take care of yourself!
-l will.

584
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,075
I'll see you soon, partner.

585
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,036
-That's it.
-We have civilians coming out!

586
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,539
-We can't take them, we got no room!
-Make room!

587
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:01,708
We can't! Now, get back, sir!

588
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:05,044
Fall back.
Move back, move back, move back!

589
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,926
Wait! Kids, kids!

590
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:28,568
Get back to the police station!

591
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,034
Backtrack, everybody! Come on, back!

592
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:48,838
They have air power. Again, enemy
has air support. We have a bird down.

593
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,340
Damn it!

594
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:52,342
Tango's heading northeast of our grid.

595
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:55,470
We've disengaged back into a
police station. We have civilians.

596
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,931
I say again, we have civilians.

597
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,476
Lockett, Kerns, secure this door.
Nothing gets in, you understand?

598
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:08,608
We got a body. Do you think you could
get rid of it so the kids don't see it?

599
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:10,568
What do you want?
Where should we go?

600
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:11,819
Dever.

601
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,738
Set up back there, okay?

602
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,743
Come on, you guys. Take the back.

603
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,995
Stay away from the window, all right?

604
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:24,499
Are there gonna be more choppers?
Did you guys call any in?

605
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:29,879
I'm sure they're gonna come for us.
They know where we are.

606
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,759
Shit.
You okay? You all right?

607
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,386
-I'm good. Yeah.
-You sure?

608
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:40,139
-You didn't get hit or nothing?
-No, I'm good, man. I'm good.

609
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:43,977
Man, they're gone. They're gone.

610
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:46,646
Everybody's gone.
Lenihan, Guerrero, Grayston.

611
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,898
Grayston. Grayston had kids.

612
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,942
Didn't deserve that.
Didn't deserve that!

613
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,860
He didn't deserve to go out like that!

614
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:56,990
Neither do you! You hear me?
You're gonna make it through this!

615
00:42:57,866 --> 00:43:01,577
All right? You're gonna get out of here.
You're gonna marry Cherise.

616
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:03,621
And you're gonna be her problem...

617
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:07,333
...because I'm done taking care
of your sorry ass, you got that?

618
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:13,047
All stations, this net. Sitrep as follow:

619
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:16,259
Enemy aircraft
number four fleets at this time.

620
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:19,804
Be advised, more entering battle
space Los Angeles from ocean...

621
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:22,348
...on bearing 2-niner-7-5-0.

622
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,809
They got air support too.

623
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:28,396
Knocked our bird right out of the sky.

624
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,441
So much for ruling the air.

625
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:35,194
There's no time for that, lieutenant.

626
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:37,238
Those bombs are gonna drop.

627
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,241
And we're in the blast radius.

628
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,911
Top of my goddamn class.

629
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:48,666
And l get out in combat in the middle
of that shit? Goddamn it!

630
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,419
I already lost four
of my goddamn men!

631
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,296
Four good men.

632
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,631
Who would go to hell and back
for you, sir.

633
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:02,055
-Have you?
-Yes.

634
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:05,224
You're not the first to lose men.
You won't be the last.

635
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:07,769
Now, put that away.
You understand me?

636
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,521
Right now your men are
awaiting orders.

637
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:14,776
Now, you can go left, you can go right.
I don't give a damn.

638
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,362
Just make a decision.

639
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,573
Lieutenant.

640
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:23,493
It's a no-go on the helo, sir.

641
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:25,578
Enemy aircraft is lighting it up.

642
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:28,081
Command says it's like nothing
they ever seen.

643
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,041
We gotta find a way out.

644
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,460
We gotta get to that F.O.B.

645
00:44:32,669 --> 00:44:35,546
You're right. We gotta move.

646
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,841
Let's get these people safe.
Lockett, Kerns!

647
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:41,636
I need you to set up
an observation post on the roof.

648
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:44,180
We're gonna move by foot,
so we gotta move fast.

649
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:47,016
Scan for hostiles,
find the best route out of here.

650
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,684
All right, sir.

651
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,229
Lieutenant.

652
00:44:56,443 --> 00:45:00,571
Officials are now saying any civilian
within 10 miles of the coast...

653
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,365
...should try to make their way...

654
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,450
...to a military
forward operating base, F.O.B.

655
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:08,621
This is the safest place
that you could be right now.

656
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:12,750
Now, the military has set up a line
of defence to try to protect civilians.

657
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:17,046
Take a look at you, make sure
you're okay, all right? Good. Okay.

658
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:20,883
Just look at this. There you go.

659
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:24,053
-Water fountain is there, Mr. Rincon.
-Okay, thank you.

660
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:25,555
-No problem.
-Thank you.

661
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:31,394
-Joe Rincon.
-Staff Sergeant Nantz.

662
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:32,770
This is my son, Hector.

663
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,649
We all wanted to thank you
for coming to get us.

664
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:38,818
Yeah.

665
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:41,779
Hey, Hector. We leave no man behind.

666
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,991
So you here
when the police got overrun?

667
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:51,164
Right. Well, long as you're both okay.

668
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,459
Hey, you all right, man?

669
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,836
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

670
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:58,421
Okay.

671
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:02,175
If you-- lf you need him
to do anything...

672
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:05,636
-...you know.
-I'll let you know.

673
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:09,932
Aye-aye, sir.

674
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:11,726
Aye.

675
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:14,103
Thank you.

676
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,194
We got two dozen hostiles
about 300 metres out.

677
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:24,989
Lieutenant, we got two dozen hostiles
300 metres north, over.

678
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:29,911
It's like those things are on overwatch,
just like us.

679
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:34,540
That one out front looks like
the leader. Now they got leadership.

680
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:36,584
So do ants, Kerns.

681
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:39,504
You think those things get scared too?

682
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:44,759
Probably just like us. They're probably
just grunts that get told to go fight.

683
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:50,014
Come on. Find us a way out of here,
Marine, because we're sitting ducks.

684
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,767
They dragged them out of the house,
into the street...

685
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:55,269
...put them in perfect order
before they shot them.

686
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,021
They shot them right in the head.

687
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:59,649
Chief, do we have any idea
why this is happening?

688
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:03,236
Well, it's clear there has been no
attempt at any kind of communication.

689
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:05,613
No demands, nothing like that.

690
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:08,407
So, obviously,
they are here for our resources.

691
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,119
When you invade a place
for resources...

692
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:14,205
...you wipe out
the indigenous population.

693
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,415
Those are the rules
of any colonisation.

694
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:20,211
And, right now,
we are being colonised.

695
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:22,421
Brave kids.

696
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:26,801
They're my nieces. My sister and her
husband are away on vacation.

697
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:34,100
Thing is, they live in Arizona.
I see them once or twice a year.

698
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,311
And now I may be all they have left.

699
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:40,648
-You have kids?
-No.

700
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:42,733
Neither do I.

701
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:47,280
I used to regret that,
but maybe it was for the best.

702
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:50,116
Of course, our planet's surface
is 70 percent water.

703
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:52,952
So again, and l have to stress this,
without certainty...

704
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:56,539
...the leading hypothesis remains
that their objective, their target...

705
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:57,790
...is our water.

706
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:01,752
-Shit.
-There ain't gonna be nothing left.

707
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:05,298
-l think l got a way out of here.
-What'd you say?

708
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:07,383
Right here, look. 200 metres out.

709
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:09,719
-What's right behind that backside?
-Bus.

710
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:12,680
-Lieutenant, we got a bus.
-Roger that.

711
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:16,183
So the men on the roof saw a bus.
They think it could be operational.

712
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:19,186
Maybe we'd be better off on foot.

713
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:22,356
It's miles to the operating base...

714
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:24,900
...and those bombs
are gonna drop in an hour.

715
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:26,152
We gotta move fast.

716
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:28,988
Bus is a big target.

717
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,406
I made the call.

718
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,326
It's my responsibility.

719
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,202
Stavrou, Harris.

720
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:38,372
Lieutenant needs recon on a bus.
If it runs, get it back here.

721
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:42,543
-You know how to hotwire a bus?
-Stavrou can. He's from Jersey, sir.

722
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:44,128
Ladies first.

723
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:49,133
Two hundred metres.

724
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:52,178
Go down, there's the cars burnt out,
there's a pickup truck.

725
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:53,846
Right back behind there.

726
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:58,684
We have a situation.
Y'all need to follow me.

727
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:03,689
Harris found it out here.
Y'all gotta see this thing.

728
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:16,035
Weapon looks like it's been
surgically attached.

729
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:18,371
Talk about commitment to cause.

730
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:26,379
Shit.

731
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:31,217
-You gotta be kidding!
-Corporal. Corporal, hold it.

732
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,929
Let me shoot this thing, staff sergeant.
That weapon's hot.

733
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,222
Let me just shoot it.

734
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:37,598
-Doc.
-Yes, staff sergeant.

735
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:39,934
Oh, Lord, have mercy.

736
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:43,771
We need to know exactly
where to hit this thing...

737
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:45,731
...so we don't waste all our ammo.

738
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,276
Maybe I can help.

739
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:50,986
I'm a veterinarian.

740
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,459
Sure you wanna do this?

741
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:08,421
I was more sure when
I was standing over there.

742
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:11,298
We gotta figure out
how to kill these things.

743
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:14,719
Otherwise, we won't last another
five minutes out there, okay?

744
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:18,222
Let's peel this back.

745
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:24,937
-Look at this, we got a organ here.
-Jesus Christ, look at that.

746
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,106
-I got another one.
-Me too.

747
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:30,317
Does it have some sort of
cognitive mechanism? Anything?

748
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:33,487
There's no frontal lobe,
no temporal lobe, no parietal lobe.

749
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,448
The cranial vault is unlike anything.

750
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:37,116
-Oh, shit.
-What?

751
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,868
-You see what I'm seeing?
-What?

752
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:41,328
The ones that were just
on the roof aren't on it.

753
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:43,539
There's about two dozen
coming out the door.

754
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,624
They're on the street heading this way.

755
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:48,294
-Lieutenant, we got movement up here.
-Roger that.

756
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:51,046
We have contact 300 metres out.
We gotta cut quick.

757
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:00,473
Lieutenant, we gotta move!
What do we do?

758
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,142
-Shit's hitting the fan. Gotta move.
-Staff sergeant.

759
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:05,561
Come on, how do you kill this thing?

760
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:15,905
Goddamn it, Stavs.

761
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,324
-I lost them.
-You lost them?

762
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:22,161
Lieutenant, they're gone.
Lieutenant, I don't see anything.

763
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:26,207
-We got a breach.
-Got a breach on the north entrance!

764
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:27,500
They're inside.

765
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:30,085
I'm gonna gather everyone
by the doors on the south side.

766
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:31,837
We're right behind you.

767
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,547
What was that?

768
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:36,175
-Adukwu, you go with her.
-Yes, staff sergeant.

769
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:39,553
-Imlay, got an HE grenade round?
-Never leave home without it.

770
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:42,139
You cover that hall to the rear.
Buy me some time.

771
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:45,059
They start coming,
you blast the hell out of them.

772
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:47,686
Hey, Harris.
Where's that goddamn bus?

773
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:50,773
Stavs. Stavs, we got an enemy scout.
Come on, let's go.

774
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:56,570
Yes! Yes! Yeah, baby!
Newark! Represent!

775
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,989
Lieutenant, we've got the bus,
heading back.

776
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,492
Okay, guys, the bus is en route!
Bus is en route!

777
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:03,661
Thirty seconds till we move out!

778
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:12,711
Imlay, give me a sitrep.
I need an update on the breach.

779
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:14,797
Report back, over.

780
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,054
We're running out of time.

781
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,440
Move!

782
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:39,154
Contact!

783
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:41,699
They've breached.

784
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,205
This is our last shot.

785
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,541
Got it.

786
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:52,710
Right here.

787
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:02,303
That's gotta be it. It's dying.

788
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:10,269
That's how we kill this thing, to
the right of where the heart would be.

789
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:11,812
-Got it.
-I got three more!

790
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:17,943
Let's get out of here.

791
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:24,950
Get them on the bus! Get them
on that bus! Let's go, let's go!

792
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:32,499
-Get on.
-Get underneath.

793
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:34,710
You okay?

794
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:42,676
Heads up. Cover your sectors of fire.
Heads up!

795
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:50,517
Marines, concentrate firepower to
the right of where the heart would be.

796
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:52,102
Yes, staff sergeant.

797
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:54,521
That's how we kill these things.

798
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:58,108
All right, remember your training.

799
00:53:58,276 --> 00:54:00,361
We got a hostile warbird,
thousand metres out.

800
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:01,862
Everybody keep your eyes up.

801
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:12,164
All buckled up back there, lieutenant.

802
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:13,791
Roger that.

803
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:17,127
It should be about
six miles to the F.O.B.

804
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,213
I don't know, 25, 30 minutes.

805
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,423
If we stay on these side streets.

806
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:24,385
Air Force is gonna level this area
in 40 minutes.

807
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:33,978
Get us to the forward operating base.
Fast.

808
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:50,285
What the hell is that?

809
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:52,371
Stavrou, stop the bus.

810
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:09,638
Everyone, get down.

811
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:28,323
Any station, this is
Foxtrot-Two-November. Sitrep to follow.

812
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:30,576
Go ahead, Foxtrot-Two-November.

813
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:33,037
Enemy aircraft.
They're lighting up the sky...

814
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:35,873
...heading east towards
downtown Los Angeles.

815
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:37,207
Copy that.

816
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,336
They're tracking our signals.

817
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,718
Mottola, turn off that radio!
They're tracking our signals!

818
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:50,179
All radios off! Cell phones, everything!

819
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,724
Give me your radio.

820
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:59,438
Mottola. Give me your radio.

821
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:03,984
Where you going?

822
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:06,320
-Staff sergeant!
-Where the hell is he going?

823
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:19,625
-We gotta get off this bus, all right?
-Ten o'clock, lieutenant, 10 o'clock!

824
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:22,961
I see it, 8 o'clock, heading south!

825
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:26,298
It's getting closer. Hey, it's on my six!

826
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:35,182
A hundred metres!

827
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:43,774
Oh, my God.

828
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,320
Everybody, get down!

829
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:04,044
Holy shit.

830
00:57:43,459 --> 00:57:45,419
-What was that?
-Is he all right?

831
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:48,088
-Did he make it out?
-Staff sergeant?

832
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,316
-There he is.
-Staff sergeant's alive!

833
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:09,651
-Yeah, he's alive!
-There he is!

834
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:46,438
That aircraft was unmanned,
Iieutenant.

835
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:48,774
Drone.

836
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:59,117
That was some real John Wayne shit,
staff sergeant.

837
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:08,752
Hey.

838
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:12,965
I can't afford to lose you.
Neither can these men, all right?

839
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:16,510
Yeah. They're your men.

840
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:20,973
All right, staff sergeant!

841
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:25,894
That's how you do it!

842
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:28,272
-That's retreat, hell!
-That's right.

843
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:31,149
Who the hell's John Wayne?

844
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:43,453
Everybody, eyes open!

845
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:45,330
Stay alert!

846
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:48,208
Thank you for that.

847
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:54,172
It's nothing.

848
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:57,384
What's that mean, "retreat, hell"?

849
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:05,976
During World War I, an officer from
our regiment was ordered to retreat.

850
01:00:06,185 --> 01:00:10,897
He said, "Retreat, hell.
We just got here."

851
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:17,404
You should have the doc
take a look at that.

852
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:19,656
I thought you were a doctor.

853
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:22,826
Animals and aliens only.

854
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:25,662
I'll put it on my to-do list.

855
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:27,664
Thank you.

856
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:40,969
Excuse me, staff sergeant. Did you
say that was an unmanned drone?

857
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:42,554
Correct.

858
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:46,475
They must have one hell of
a command-and-control system.

859
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:49,728
If NORTHCOM didn't agree with you,
I wouldn't be here.

860
01:00:49,937 --> 01:00:51,355
Why?

861
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:56,610
My mission was to provide AIS
with a strike package.

862
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:58,362
A strike package?

863
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:02,282
Yeah, coordinates for a missile strike
on a command-and-control centre.

864
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:06,411
But the asset fell off
the grid and we lost them.

865
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:19,800
All side streets are blocked.
Our only choice is to take the freeway.

866
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:23,220
All right. Well, it's your call.

867
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:25,138
Stavrou, get us on a freeway.

868
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:30,185
We don't wanna be in this area
when these bombs start to fall.

869
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:56,044
Try to miss at least
one of the cars, Stavrou.

870
01:01:57,922 --> 01:01:59,506
Just keep driving.

871
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:02,050
Off ramp is one mile ahead.

872
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:10,016
Jesus.

873
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:12,811
Look out.

874
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:22,362
The ramp, it's gone, lieutenant.

875
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:30,829
All right, Robertson exit,
half a click away.

876
01:02:32,623 --> 01:02:34,332
Look out! Incoming, 12 o'clock!

877
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:45,427
-You okay?
-Harper!

878
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:55,645
Tank's drawing enemy fire!
It's a good time to move!

879
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:58,106
I'll suppress the fire,
you take the civilians!

880
01:02:58,316 --> 01:03:00,317
Secure this exit, Imlay!

881
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:06,490
Imlay, get me a defensive line
on that vehicle!

882
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:12,954
-Move, move, move!
-Let's go! Come on.

883
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:15,707
-Let's go!
-Come on, stay down, stay down!

884
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,924
Just keep everybody calm.
We'll be right back, all right?

885
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:25,842
All right. Safety first, buddy.

886
01:03:29,096 --> 01:03:33,934
Martinez, if we get the civilians to that
helo, they take cover, rappel down.

887
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,895
I got a dozen up on the bridge.
They're moving down.

888
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:40,482
Lieutenant! Tank's out!
Nothing's stopping them now!

889
01:03:43,402 --> 01:03:47,239
Staff sergeant, civilians won't make it
to that helo without cover fire.

890
01:03:48,282 --> 01:03:50,325
Lockett, Kerns, on me, let's go!

891
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:52,744
Let's move, let's move, let's move!

892
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:59,042
Get the civilians down, all right?
Move!

893
01:04:04,298 --> 01:04:05,799
Come on!

894
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:10,762
About a 30-foot drop. Let's go.

895
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:15,433
Get behind the bus!
Now, now, now! Get behind it!

896
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:18,812
Kids first! Around the body,
bring them down one at a time.

897
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:20,397
Roger that.

898
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:23,608
Imlay!

899
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:26,403
Get your team
up on that garbage truck!

900
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:30,240
Staff sergeant, cover us up front!
Stavs, you're with me! On me now!

901
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:35,829
We're gonna run behind that helicopter
and we're gonna rope down, all right?

902
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:37,330
The girls will be first.

903
01:04:37,498 --> 01:04:40,500
I promise you nothing's
gonna happen. Okay? Stay down!

904
01:04:42,878 --> 01:04:45,505
Lieutenant, dozen hostiles,
maybe more!

905
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:48,216
Four hundred metres
and closing fast!

906
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:51,136
Cover, cover!
What the hell are you doing?

907
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:52,929
You guys need another gun.

908
01:04:54,098 --> 01:04:56,891
Three o'clock. Up on the bridge,
Santos. Up on the bridge.

909
01:04:57,101 --> 01:04:58,893
Incoming!

910
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,986
Ten o'clock!

911
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:15,243
-Reloading!
-Aim for the leader!

912
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:21,666
Hell, you can take all the room
you want.

913
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:24,127
Mottola, move, move, move!

914
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:28,965
Yes, staff sergeant! Come on, let's go!
Let's go, go, go! Run now, run!

915
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:32,761
Keep running! Don't stop, run!
Run, run, run!

916
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:41,895
-Get in there!
-Cover me!

917
01:05:43,814 --> 01:05:46,733
-I'm going for the .50 cal!
-Hurry up!

918
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:54,324
Get some, Lockett.

919
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:07,962
-Shit.
-What the hell is that thing?

920
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:09,714
I'm engaging!

921
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:17,013
You'll be okay, all right? It's okay.
Listen to me. You're going to be okay.

922
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:20,183
I got you. I will not let anything
happen to you, all right?

923
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:27,774
Shit!

924
01:06:29,443 --> 01:06:31,277
Man down!

925
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:34,823
You're gonna be okay. Hold on,
hold on! Keep going. Hold on!

926
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:37,033
Keep looking up!

927
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:46,167
Oh, God!

928
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:48,211
I got you. It's okay. It's okay.

929
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:51,297
Get the ant that's controlling
that thing!

930
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,136
Lockett, get off your ass!

931
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:03,601
It's turning this way!

932
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:06,730
It's about to hit the fan, guys.
Get out now! Move!

933
01:07:06,939 --> 01:07:08,565
Santos, come on!

934
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:10,984
-Come on!
-I'm stuck.

935
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:12,485
Go!

936
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:15,530
-What are you doing?
-Go!

937
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:18,616
Imlay!

938
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:31,254
Where's Stavrou?

939
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:37,677
Mottorola! How many down?

940
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:41,890
Two down, staff sarge! One to go!

941
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:44,517
Look at me, look at me. Look, look.
Be good, okay?

942
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:48,521
-It's gonna be fine, okay? You ready?
-Lieutenant, C-4!

943
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:52,484
Let's blow this sucker to hell!

944
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:54,986
Let's do it.

945
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,447
Kerns!

946
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:05,622
Covering!

947
01:08:17,384 --> 01:08:18,843
All right, dough is good to go!

948
01:08:19,053 --> 01:08:20,845
-Go!
-Covering!

949
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:28,686
Damn it! We've lost the detonator.

950
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:32,899
-You all right?
-Yeah, got the wind knocked out of me.

951
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:41,366
-Mottorola!
-Dad!

952
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:43,701
You're okay, Hector! You're okay.

953
01:08:43,869 --> 01:08:45,286
Hold on!

954
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:51,709
-I need bandages from the first aid kit.
-Sir! Sir!

955
01:08:51,919 --> 01:08:53,336
It's okay!

956
01:09:00,594 --> 01:09:02,220
Oh, my God!

957
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:04,138
All right.

958
01:09:19,613 --> 01:09:21,573
We gotta get you to a medevac.

959
01:09:21,782 --> 01:09:23,283
Doc!

960
01:09:27,454 --> 01:09:28,496
Oh, shit, man!

961
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:30,415
-We need some cover!
-Damn it, I'm out!

962
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:32,876
-Got another mag, Lockett?
-They kicking our ass!

963
01:09:33,043 --> 01:09:35,378
You're getting pinned down,
staff sergeant!

964
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:37,881
Marines, you're getting pinned down!

965
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:41,175
-We're not leaving you.
-Staff sergeant, get them out!

966
01:09:41,385 --> 01:09:43,428
-Lieutenant, I am not leav--
-Get them out!

967
01:09:43,637 --> 01:09:45,680
-No, I'm not leaving you!
-Get them out!

968
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:46,931
No! Not again!

969
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:52,770
I have a bag of C-4 on the bus.

970
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:55,773
Give this to my wife...

971
01:09:55,983 --> 01:09:58,693
...and get them off
this goddamn freeway.

972
01:10:02,489 --> 01:10:03,990
That's an order.

973
01:10:07,202 --> 01:10:08,786
Yes, sir.

974
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:13,583
Right behind you.

975
01:10:21,842 --> 01:10:23,092
Cover the lieutenant!

976
01:10:26,305 --> 01:10:27,472
Hey, I'm out!

977
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:35,229
They're closing in!

978
01:10:39,026 --> 01:10:40,109
Here we go.

979
01:10:46,116 --> 01:10:48,451
This is Lieutenant William Martinez...

980
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:52,163
...Echo Company, 2nd Battalion,
5th Marines. Hoorah!

981
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:59,772
We're still half a klick
inside the bombing zone.

982
01:12:02,192 --> 01:12:04,318
Move to live, Marines.

983
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:11,826
Did he just leave the lieutenant
back there to die?

984
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:13,703
Sure looked that way.

985
01:12:13,912 --> 01:12:16,497
And this is the guy
in charge of us now?

986
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:18,666
Let's move.

987
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:26,007
Hey, those are our jets.
We're still in the fight.

988
01:12:27,634 --> 01:12:30,303
All right, we're clear of the bomb zone.

989
01:12:30,804 --> 01:12:32,388
Let's tighten this place down.

990
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:34,265
Bombs drop in six minutes.

991
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:36,434
Santos, Kerns, on me.

992
01:12:36,643 --> 01:12:40,396
Let's see if there are any comms.
All right? Hardwire only.

993
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:01,751
-Corporal Harris, we clear?
-We're clear!

994
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:04,962
-Do you have a hard line in here?
-Over there.

995
01:13:09,259 --> 01:13:10,927
Now, my son's an optimist.

996
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:16,265
When this first happened, he said,
"Why don't we go try to talk to them?

997
01:13:17,601 --> 01:13:19,644
Maybe they wanna be friends."

998
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:24,565
Hector? Hey.

999
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:27,902
We're gonna go get some food
and water for your dad, okay?

1000
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:30,071
It's okay.

1001
01:13:31,031 --> 01:13:32,406
And what'd you tell him?

1002
01:13:32,616 --> 01:13:34,158
I said:

1003
01:13:34,785 --> 01:13:37,245
"You know, if they're chasing
and shooting us...

1004
01:13:37,454 --> 01:13:39,831
...they're probably not good friends."

1005
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:46,420
I should've followed directions
and gone to the F.O.B.

1006
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:50,091
I should've never stayed at the police
station, but I was scared, man.

1007
01:13:52,344 --> 01:13:54,387
I made all the wrong decisions.

1008
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:56,848
You trusted your gut, Mr. Rincon.

1009
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:59,934
You made a call.

1010
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:02,895
I'd do the same thing
to protect my Marines.

1011
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:12,238
-I had a situation my last tour.
-Yeah?

1012
01:14:13,448 --> 01:14:16,826
There was no right call. You went left
or you go right, it didn't matter.

1013
01:14:20,205 --> 01:14:21,789
But you're alive.

1014
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:23,833
Yeah, I survived.

1015
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:27,837
But I wasn't supposed to.

1016
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:32,258
Staff Sergeant Nantz....

1017
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:43,352
You promise to save my son?

1018
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:53,905
Staff sergeant, we have
a hardwired connection!

1019
01:14:56,408 --> 01:14:59,410
Doc, keep him warm.
Sun is going down.

1020
01:15:00,412 --> 01:15:02,163
This will keep you warm.

1021
01:15:02,581 --> 01:15:06,876
We're estimating that 20 cities in 17
countries are now under full attack.

1022
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:10,922
It's obvious the enemy is attempting
to cut us off from one another.

1023
01:15:11,131 --> 01:15:14,342
Is there any more information
at this time, Professor Stavert?

1024
01:15:14,551 --> 01:15:17,345
New data shows that they're using
our water as their fuel...

1025
01:15:17,512 --> 01:15:19,680
...and our ocean levels
are already decreasing.

1026
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:22,808
They are using it to power their ships,
their machinery...

1027
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:26,979
...possibly their own bodies. It's the
composition of our water that's unique.

1028
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:30,566
It's in a liquid state. No other
locations in our known universe...

1029
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:33,402
...have liquid H2O
anywhere near their surface.

1030
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:37,240
I just saw a field report that said
they will use our sewage systems...

1031
01:15:37,449 --> 01:15:40,826
-...to follow our water to their ships.
-How'd you get that to work?

1032
01:15:40,994 --> 01:15:45,039
These things are everywhere. There's
one off the coast of 20 countries.

1033
01:15:45,249 --> 01:15:47,875
They're calling it
the command-and-control centre.

1034
01:15:49,002 --> 01:15:51,754
-That's the thing you were tracking?
-Yeah.

1035
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:55,758
So you're saying that's the thing
that's controlling the drones?

1036
01:15:55,968 --> 01:16:00,596
Yeah. And if we wipe it out,
we take out their air power.

1037
01:16:03,267 --> 01:16:05,059
These bombs better work.

1038
01:16:05,269 --> 01:16:07,520
-Let's move it.
-Bring him through here.

1039
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:10,773
-Set him down.
-How much time we got?

1040
01:16:11,566 --> 01:16:12,650
One minute.

1041
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:19,198
Air Force about to lay some pain
on those extraterritorial bastards.

1042
01:16:22,286 --> 01:16:24,495
-All right, Two-Five, retreat....
-Hell!

1043
01:16:24,705 --> 01:16:26,622
-Retreat....
-Hell!

1044
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:29,166
Here we go.

1045
01:16:29,334 --> 01:16:31,794
Come on.
Let's fry these sons of bitches.

1046
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:34,547
We get to the F.O.B.
after these bombs drop, get ammo.

1047
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:37,967
And some goddamn reinforcements.
Some goddamn tanks.

1048
01:16:43,056 --> 01:16:44,974
-Ten.
-Gotta be strong, okay?

1049
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:46,642
Nine.

1050
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:48,519
Eight.

1051
01:16:48,729 --> 01:16:50,021
Seven.

1052
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:51,772
Six.

1053
01:16:51,982 --> 01:16:53,357
Five.

1054
01:16:53,942 --> 01:16:55,359
Four.

1055
01:16:56,403 --> 01:16:57,778
Three....

1056
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:00,865
Shit. Everybody, brace!

1057
01:17:21,928 --> 01:17:23,804
-They should've dropped.
-What the hell?

1058
01:17:24,014 --> 01:17:27,683
Wouldn't we have felt that from here if
they'd dropped? We would've felt them.

1059
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:30,102
Would've felt it in Nevada
with that ordnance.

1060
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:31,812
That clock right?

1061
01:17:32,022 --> 01:17:33,272
That's what I got.

1062
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:36,776
Maybe it's a good thing. Maybe we
turned the tide. That's a good thing.

1063
01:17:36,943 --> 01:17:39,362
You damn straight, Imlay.
We was kicking some ass.

1064
01:17:39,571 --> 01:17:42,239
Could they have taken out
the whole Air Force?

1065
01:17:42,449 --> 01:17:44,158
This isn't happening.

1066
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:45,493
Let's move.

1067
01:17:45,702 --> 01:17:47,787
Everybody, up, up. Let's move.
Come on.

1068
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:50,831
We're in the home stretch, everybody.
We in the home stretch.

1069
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:11,435
Now we know why
those bombs didn't drop.

1070
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:15,356
They wiped our forward
operating base right off the map.

1071
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:19,318
All clear, staff sergeant!

1072
01:18:19,569 --> 01:18:22,279
All right, let's bring him back here.

1073
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:27,535
Hang in there, buddy.

1074
01:18:27,744 --> 01:18:30,329
Million-and-one odds
we'd get here in the first place...

1075
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:34,792
...we get here and there ain't nothing.
I knew Nantz would never get us out.

1076
01:18:36,837 --> 01:18:40,840
-There were thousands of Marines here.
-Now it's just seven of us, Imlay.

1077
01:18:42,592 --> 01:18:44,885
You remind me of my older brother.

1078
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:47,471
How's that?

1079
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:50,516
He never smiles either.

1080
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:55,521
Secure the front with Harris.

1081
01:18:57,524 --> 01:18:59,024
Imlay, anything?

1082
01:18:59,234 --> 01:19:01,277
Nothing.
We only got maps of Santa Monica.

1083
01:19:01,486 --> 01:19:04,071
We need something farther east.
They're all burned.

1084
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:05,364
Follow me, Imlay.

1085
01:19:10,328 --> 01:19:13,164
All right, here's the
battalion commander's hooch.

1086
01:19:13,331 --> 01:19:15,749
Looking for maps,
anything with an extraction point.

1087
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:17,710
Staff sergeant.

1088
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:28,804
I'll be right back.

1089
01:19:35,145 --> 01:19:37,229
Found a tactical map, staff sergeant.

1090
01:19:37,397 --> 01:19:39,815
Shows where all the units
were deployed.

1091
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:43,486
-What the hell are all these red marks?
-Means they're gone.

1092
01:19:43,695 --> 01:19:46,739
-You mean the units got moved?
-Wiped out.

1093
01:19:47,365 --> 01:19:49,783
-All of them?
-All of them.

1094
01:19:49,993 --> 01:19:51,243
Oh, shit.

1095
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:55,581
All right. One alternate extraction site
is still operational.

1096
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:58,042
That's eight klicks.

1097
01:19:58,251 --> 01:20:02,046
Staff sergeant? Staff sergeant.

1098
01:20:02,964 --> 01:20:05,758
Adukwu, plenty of weapons around.
Find yourself an M-16.

1099
01:20:06,176 --> 01:20:07,510
Mr. Rincon is dead.

1100
01:20:32,202 --> 01:20:33,827
Wake up, Dad.

1101
01:20:42,087 --> 01:20:44,755
Please help me right now.

1102
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:48,425
Don't leave me.

1103
01:20:53,974 --> 01:20:56,350
I'm so sorry, Hector.

1104
01:21:00,438 --> 01:21:01,897
I'm sorry.

1105
01:21:02,983 --> 01:21:04,108
No.

1106
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:08,112
Your dad tried so hard
to stay with you.

1107
01:21:09,614 --> 01:21:11,865
-I'm sorr--
-I don't wanna be here.

1108
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:20,499
It's okay, bud.

1109
01:21:27,674 --> 01:21:30,551
Your father was a brave man, Hector.

1110
01:21:39,811 --> 01:21:44,356
Hector, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, buddy.

1111
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:46,650
It's okay to cry.

1112
01:21:51,906 --> 01:21:54,158
He loved you very much.

1113
01:21:55,243 --> 01:21:57,161
Listen to me, Hector.

1114
01:21:58,830 --> 01:22:02,875
I need you to be brave for me.
I need you to be my little Marine.

1115
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:07,379
Okay?

1116
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:11,634
We gotta be brave for the others.

1117
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:16,096
Do you know why?

1118
01:22:18,058 --> 01:22:19,558
Why?

1119
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:25,189
Because Marines don't quit.

1120
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:28,817
Do you believe that?

1121
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:32,571
Say it for me.

1122
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:39,286
-Marines don't quit.
-Good.

1123
01:22:39,829 --> 01:22:43,832
I'm gonna get you out of here, Hector.
I promise.

1124
01:22:47,462 --> 01:22:50,214
Let's go see the girls, okay? Come on.

1125
01:23:08,191 --> 01:23:11,610
We are not losing one more
of those civilians. Understand?

1126
01:23:13,905 --> 01:23:16,740
You getting us out too, staff sergeant?

1127
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:20,619
Or are we expendable?

1128
01:23:30,422 --> 01:23:32,172
All right, Lockett.

1129
01:23:33,007 --> 01:23:35,259
You wanna go there, let's go there.

1130
01:23:39,556 --> 01:23:42,266
I commanded men and men died.

1131
01:23:42,517 --> 01:23:47,187
Kids. 19 years old.
The best men I ever led.

1132
01:23:47,939 --> 01:23:52,776
Do you think for one second I wouldn't
rather trade places with them?

1133
01:23:59,033 --> 01:24:01,785
I know you think I got my men killed.

1134
01:24:04,664 --> 01:24:06,165
They're dead.

1135
01:24:07,792 --> 01:24:09,293
I'm here.

1136
01:24:10,128 --> 01:24:12,629
Like the punch line to some bad joke.

1137
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:14,798
You think I like that?

1138
01:24:15,133 --> 01:24:18,427
Do you think a minute goes by
that those faces aren't right here...

1139
01:24:18,636 --> 01:24:20,804
...seared into my brain?

1140
01:24:24,142 --> 01:24:28,645
Dante, Thomas T. Corporal.
1-5-6-5-0-9-3-8-6.

1141
01:24:28,813 --> 01:24:34,485
Ambruster, William R. Private.
8-7-6-6-6-2-3-5-4.

1142
01:24:35,195 --> 01:24:37,738
Wharton, Jeffrey H.

1143
01:24:37,947 --> 01:24:42,993
Lance Corporal. 8-7-4-2-7-3-9-9-3.

1144
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:48,457
Lockett...

1145
01:24:51,419 --> 01:24:54,421
...Duane G.

1146
01:24:56,090 --> 01:24:57,716
Corporal.

1147
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:04,014
1-5-6-8-7-0-9....

1148
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:06,141
Five-five.

1149
01:25:08,228 --> 01:25:10,979
Your brother
was an outstanding Marine.

1150
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:14,817
He was my friend.

1151
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:20,823
And I miss him every day.

1152
01:25:23,868 --> 01:25:25,369
And you remind me of him.

1153
01:25:34,712 --> 01:25:36,880
None of that matters right now.

1154
01:25:38,716 --> 01:25:42,636
Because our duty is to keep
moving forwards, to keep fighting.

1155
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:45,514
That's how we honour your brother...

1156
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:47,891
...and Lieutenant Martinez...

1157
01:25:48,142 --> 01:25:50,143
...Corporal Stavrou...

1158
01:25:50,353 --> 01:25:52,354
...Lance Corporal Mottola...

1159
01:25:53,231 --> 01:25:54,356
...Hector's father...

1160
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:58,569
...who picked up a rifle and did what
needed to be done. A civilian.

1161
01:25:58,778 --> 01:26:01,154
So we better damn well step it up.

1162
01:26:01,364 --> 01:26:03,407
Discard any lingering doubt.

1163
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:06,577
Work fast, work as a unit,
and we will prevail.

1164
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:09,079
Let's figure out
how we're gonna get out of this.

1165
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:11,415
Imlay, you come with me.
Get to higher ground.

1166
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:14,209
The rest of you, find some ammo
and some vehicles.

1167
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:17,921
Gotta be a few LAV's or armoured
Humvees still operational.

1168
01:26:18,798 --> 01:26:22,009
Sorry, bro. You didn't deserve this.

1169
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:27,723
You went down fighting.

1170
01:26:34,105 --> 01:26:35,564
Holy shit.

1171
01:26:35,773 --> 01:26:37,774
I wasn't expecting to see all this.

1172
01:26:39,444 --> 01:26:41,111
That don't look good.

1173
01:26:41,362 --> 01:26:42,613
Reinforcements.

1174
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:49,036
Holy shit.

1175
01:26:50,788 --> 01:26:53,040
They already set up a beachhead.

1176
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:55,250
All right.

1177
01:26:56,878 --> 01:27:01,048
If that evac site is still operational,
I think we can get behind the line.

1178
01:27:01,257 --> 01:27:03,133
That's gonna be one hell of a ride.

1179
01:27:03,384 --> 01:27:05,302
Yeah, well, that's what we get paid for.

1180
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:09,097
Everybody move to the LAV now! Go!

1181
01:27:09,307 --> 01:27:11,808
Any station, this net.
This is Foxtrot-Two-November.

1182
01:27:11,976 --> 01:27:13,143
We have 11 passengers.

1183
01:27:13,394 --> 01:27:17,648
Requesting evacuation at alternate
extraction point Charlie.

1184
01:27:17,857 --> 01:27:19,858
Are there any birds in the air? Over.

1185
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:23,862
Foxtrot-Two-November, this is
Sierra 2-5. Orders are to pull back.

1186
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:28,158
Get to extraction point Charlie
by 0300 or we'll be gone. Over.

1187
01:27:28,368 --> 01:27:31,328
Roger that. 0300, not a minute more.
Out.

1188
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:35,791
Imlay, ever see what
a Bushmaster chain gun can do?

1189
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,460
-Oh, shit, yes, staff sergeant.
-Get on it, son.

1190
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:40,671
Let's do this!

1191
01:27:44,676 --> 01:27:46,176
-No lights, Kerns.
-Roger that.

1192
01:27:47,178 --> 01:27:48,804
Let's move.

1193
01:27:52,016 --> 01:27:53,642
Bushmaster is locked and loaded.

1194
01:27:53,851 --> 01:27:55,102
Give them hell.

1195
01:27:55,311 --> 01:27:56,812
Damn right.

1196
01:28:08,366 --> 01:28:10,534
Two minutes till that helo drops.

1197
01:28:13,204 --> 01:28:14,955
Everybody okay?

1198
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:21,044
All right, Kerns, take a left.

1199
01:28:21,212 --> 01:28:24,464
I want you to go over three blocks,
then you go about five blocks...

1200
01:28:24,674 --> 01:28:26,550
...hang a right, and straight.

1201
01:28:26,801 --> 01:28:29,636
-That should get us to the evac site.
-Yes, staff sergeant.

1202
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:35,559
-I'd hold on if I were you, Lockett!
-Copy that!

1203
01:28:37,395 --> 01:28:39,229
-We got hostiles.
-What's going on?

1204
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:42,399
-Let's not wait around and find out.
-It's gonna be okay.

1205
01:28:42,567 --> 01:28:45,402
Got about 250 rounds, staff sergeant.

1206
01:28:53,494 --> 01:28:55,245
Know what they say if you hit a deer?

1207
01:28:55,496 --> 01:28:57,247
-Speed up!
-Damn straight!

1208
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:04,504
-Come on!
-Y'all hold on!

1209
01:29:04,714 --> 01:29:07,257
We're gonna have to go
right through them!

1210
01:29:12,638 --> 01:29:15,432
-You saw that?
-They're going down like bowling pins!

1211
01:29:39,874 --> 01:29:41,416
Kick it out!

1212
01:29:41,751 --> 01:29:44,419
Run that sucker over, man!

1213
01:29:46,756 --> 01:29:47,881
Santos, you okay?

1214
01:29:48,716 --> 01:29:51,593
I got that nasty stuff
all over my mouth, man!

1215
01:29:54,138 --> 01:29:57,974
-It's not funny.
-You let him do you on the first date.

1216
01:30:11,823 --> 01:30:14,491
-Everyone okay?
-Yes!

1217
01:30:15,868 --> 01:30:17,077
Let's get us home.

1218
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:25,502
Cease fire!

1219
01:30:30,133 --> 01:30:32,509
-Stay close, stay close!
-What are we doing?

1220
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:39,599
Load them up! Our flight path
won't be clear much longer!

1221
01:30:39,809 --> 01:30:41,768
You're in the middle of the shit,
sergeant!

1222
01:30:41,936 --> 01:30:43,395
What happened to all our air?

1223
01:30:43,604 --> 01:30:46,940
Pulled back to save our assets!
They were blowing us out!

1224
01:30:47,150 --> 01:30:48,817
We're abandoning Los Angeles!

1225
01:30:58,661 --> 01:31:00,662
Let's go, Imlay!

1226
01:31:00,997 --> 01:31:02,706
Son, you okay?

1227
01:31:04,584 --> 01:31:05,959
All right.

1228
01:31:07,378 --> 01:31:09,796
Let's move! Move, move!

1229
01:31:10,923 --> 01:31:13,008
Come on, Harris, let's go!

1230
01:31:55,009 --> 01:31:56,468
Hold on!

1231
01:31:59,430 --> 01:32:01,056
-You all right?
-Everybody all good?

1232
01:32:01,265 --> 01:32:03,516
-Girls?
-Everybody okay?

1233
01:32:03,726 --> 01:32:05,352
Hold on tight!

1234
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:08,396
What happened?

1235
01:32:08,606 --> 01:32:11,858
Pilot said something
was playing hell with our power!

1236
01:32:12,068 --> 01:32:15,445
Staff sergeant! Nine o'clock!

1237
01:32:21,369 --> 01:32:24,537
Santos, you said you were tracking
massive RF signals?

1238
01:32:24,747 --> 01:32:27,332
Could a concentration of them
knock out power?

1239
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:31,419
Yes, definitely! Why?

1240
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:34,172
Could be their
command-and-control centre!

1241
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:39,010
Get me down there!

1242
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:40,637
What?

1243
01:32:41,764 --> 01:32:44,057
I gotta recon that area!

1244
01:32:44,267 --> 01:32:46,559
No way! It's a suicide!

1245
01:32:46,769 --> 01:32:50,522
Damn it, we're the only ones left!
All the other forces have fallen back!

1246
01:32:50,731 --> 01:32:55,318
We can't land! May not have power
to take off again!

1247
01:33:02,702 --> 01:33:05,078
This is a letter for Martinez's wife.

1248
01:33:06,455 --> 01:33:07,998
Will you get it to her?

1249
01:33:11,335 --> 01:33:12,711
Yeah.

1250
01:33:18,092 --> 01:33:20,760
Hover at 40 feet!

1251
01:33:21,262 --> 01:33:22,679
-Twenty seconds!
-Roger that!

1252
01:33:27,226 --> 01:33:29,686
Come on, Adukwu, let's get this off.

1253
01:33:29,895 --> 01:33:32,105
Staff sergeant, what the hell
are you doing?

1254
01:33:32,315 --> 01:33:35,317
We're in the clear!
We're almost home, Imlay!

1255
01:33:35,526 --> 01:33:37,610
You're in charge now!

1256
01:33:38,487 --> 01:33:41,156
You get these civilians home safe!

1257
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:47,829
You're the bravest Marine I ever seen,
Hector!

1258
01:33:49,248 --> 01:33:50,790
No!

1259
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:36,795
Everybody, take cover.

1260
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,341
I told you to stay in that helo.

1261
01:34:41,550 --> 01:34:45,053
Civilians are free and clear.
We were worried about your ass.

1262
01:34:45,429 --> 01:34:47,639
I think the command-and-control asset
is nearby.

1263
01:34:48,224 --> 01:34:50,350
Kerns, how many klicks
to that blackout?

1264
01:34:50,810 --> 01:34:53,019
It's about five klicks, staff sergeant.

1265
01:34:53,229 --> 01:34:54,687
Five klicks. All right.

1266
01:34:55,272 --> 01:34:57,399
We're gonna use this overpass
for cover.

1267
01:34:58,692 --> 01:35:00,110
If we take out those drones...

1268
01:35:00,319 --> 01:35:03,822
...our military might have a chance
to get back into this fight.

1269
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:05,824
Santos...

1270
01:35:06,242 --> 01:35:09,911
...where would you put a command and
control asset if you wanted to protect it?

1271
01:35:11,205 --> 01:35:12,956
-Underground.
-Let's go.

1272
01:35:14,625 --> 01:35:17,752
Everybody, let's move. Come on.
Move, move, move.

1273
01:35:43,237 --> 01:35:44,279
Move.

1274
01:36:38,709 --> 01:36:41,461
They must've gone back up.
Just leads up to the street.

1275
01:36:41,670 --> 01:36:44,756
I thought they were leading us
to the command-and-control centre.

1276
01:36:45,216 --> 01:36:46,674
Damn it.

1277
01:36:51,013 --> 01:36:53,181
Let's go. Back.

1278
01:37:01,815 --> 01:37:04,150
Holy shit!

1279
01:37:04,735 --> 01:37:06,861
Santos!

1280
01:37:22,253 --> 01:37:24,128
They know we're here now.

1281
01:37:34,723 --> 01:37:36,975
That's their command-and-control.

1282
01:37:42,481 --> 01:37:45,275
Everybody out now!
Move, move, move! Follow me!

1283
01:37:45,776 --> 01:37:49,487
Up here! Up that ladder, go!
Move, move, move! Up that ladder!

1284
01:37:50,322 --> 01:37:52,615
Let's go! Move it up!
Blow that grate, Imlay!

1285
01:37:54,034 --> 01:37:55,243
Move, move, move!

1286
01:38:02,042 --> 01:38:03,793
We're right over their command asset.

1287
01:38:04,295 --> 01:38:09,048
That's it, all right. Let's move the
concrete slab, 1 o'clock. Let's move.

1288
01:38:11,218 --> 01:38:12,468
Fire in the hole!

1289
01:38:12,678 --> 01:38:15,013
That should give us a couple minutes.

1290
01:38:31,322 --> 01:38:34,407
Laser target, staff sergeant?
We don't have any more jets, though.

1291
01:38:34,617 --> 01:38:37,744
They can fire ground-to-ground
missiles from Edwards Air Force Base.

1292
01:38:37,911 --> 01:38:40,413
We radio in a strike,
paint the target with the laser.

1293
01:38:40,623 --> 01:38:42,290
-Aye-aye, staff sergeant.
-Hoorah.

1294
01:38:42,499 --> 01:38:45,543
Our best chance at radio reception
is on top of that building...

1295
01:38:45,711 --> 01:38:47,128
...but it's the most exposed.

1296
01:38:47,338 --> 01:38:49,797
I'll do it, staff sergeant.
I'll make the call.

1297
01:38:50,007 --> 01:38:51,466
Santos, you got those codes?

1298
01:38:51,675 --> 01:38:53,718
Air Force strike package coming up.

1299
01:38:55,304 --> 01:38:58,514
You get to high ground. Once you
radio in, they'll track that signal.

1300
01:38:58,724 --> 01:39:00,266
Things are gonna get real hot.

1301
01:39:00,476 --> 01:39:03,811
So once you make that call,
you get the hell out of there, all right?

1302
01:39:04,355 --> 01:39:05,521
You know what that means?

1303
01:39:05,731 --> 01:39:08,900
We're gonna have to hold those
things off till the strike gets here.

1304
01:39:09,109 --> 01:39:11,110
Bingo. Marines...

1305
01:39:12,571 --> 01:39:16,783
...we make our stand here. Let those
bastards know who they're fucking with.

1306
01:39:16,992 --> 01:39:18,034
-Retreat....
-Hell!

1307
01:39:18,243 --> 01:39:19,702
Two-Five.

1308
01:39:30,547 --> 01:39:32,882
-Right of the heart, right?
-Right of the heart.

1309
01:39:33,425 --> 01:39:35,677
They're gonna be coming up
from there. Take two.

1310
01:39:35,886 --> 01:39:38,262
Plant one there and the other one
on the other side.

1311
01:39:38,472 --> 01:39:41,099
-Keep your head down, get it done.
-Doc, watch your back!

1312
01:39:41,308 --> 01:39:43,434
Watch your head! Watch it!

1313
01:39:51,402 --> 01:40:00,159
Any station, this is
Foxtrot-Two-November, do you copy?

1314
01:40:00,369 --> 01:40:02,620
Foxtrot-Two-November,
this is Yankee-Tango, over.

1315
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:06,332
We have a priority fire mission. We've
located an enemy command centre...

1316
01:40:06,583 --> 01:40:10,044
...under grid 885-342.

1317
01:40:10,254 --> 01:40:13,172
We will be lasing. Code 1-2-0.

1318
01:40:13,382 --> 01:40:15,800
I say again, we will be lasing.
Code 1-2-0.

1319
01:40:16,009 --> 01:40:18,553
Copy that.
Time to target, three minutes.

1320
01:40:20,556 --> 01:40:21,597
Staff sergeant!

1321
01:40:22,391 --> 01:40:25,685
We got three minutes!
It's coming in three minutes!

1322
01:40:25,894 --> 01:40:28,730
All right. Let's paint this target.

1323
01:40:40,492 --> 01:40:42,869
Hell of a shot, Kerns!
Get your ass out of there!

1324
01:40:44,663 --> 01:40:47,123
Get out of there, Kerns! Shit.

1325
01:40:51,128 --> 01:40:53,087
-Shit!
-Kerns!

1326
01:40:56,049 --> 01:40:58,509
Shit! Shit!

1327
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:05,600
Doc, Doc! Get to cover now!
Move, move!

1328
01:41:05,809 --> 01:41:07,393
Shit.

1329
01:41:10,522 --> 01:41:12,273
Contact! Twelve o'clock!

1330
01:41:13,192 --> 01:41:14,984
Covering up front!

1331
01:41:15,194 --> 01:41:17,195
-Go, go, go!
-Go on, get in there!

1332
01:41:18,947 --> 01:41:20,740
Shift fire left! Shift fire left!

1333
01:41:21,909 --> 01:41:23,451
Right there, right there!

1334
01:41:29,082 --> 01:41:30,416
Got it!

1335
01:41:31,293 --> 01:41:33,127
Sixty seconds left.

1336
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:45,431
-Lockett!
-Shit!

1337
01:41:49,019 --> 01:41:50,436
Let's go!

1338
01:41:57,986 --> 01:42:00,154
Back in the fight, Santos!

1339
01:42:00,948 --> 01:42:02,782
-Need a little help!
-Covering!

1340
01:42:02,991 --> 01:42:05,034
Imlay, use your grenade launcher!

1341
01:42:05,244 --> 01:42:07,411
-I got it, Doc!
-Covering!

1342
01:42:15,587 --> 01:42:18,256
Where's that goddamn artillery?
Should've hit by now.

1343
01:42:19,758 --> 01:42:21,509
Doc, let's go!

1344
01:42:25,055 --> 01:42:27,473
-Doc?
-Imlay! Imlay!

1345
01:42:36,233 --> 01:42:37,942
Incoming!

1346
01:42:43,323 --> 01:42:44,657
Yes!

1347
01:42:45,492 --> 01:42:48,160
Santos, we got it! We got it!

1348
01:42:50,038 --> 01:42:53,082
Direct hit! Direct hit!

1349
01:42:53,250 --> 01:42:54,542
Staff sergeant, you did it!

1350
01:42:58,088 --> 01:42:59,380
Yes, we got it!

1351
01:42:59,882 --> 01:43:02,383
The strike package. It went through?

1352
01:43:03,010 --> 01:43:05,386
-It came through?
-Yeah! All right, Kerns!

1353
01:43:06,555 --> 01:43:07,972
It's over.

1354
01:43:25,073 --> 01:43:26,699
It's coming up. It's coming up.

1355
01:43:38,921 --> 01:43:41,380
They're trying to get away.

1356
01:43:46,386 --> 01:43:49,722
The goddamn thing can fly,
staff sergeant. It's flying now!

1357
01:43:49,932 --> 01:43:51,098
I'll get you out!

1358
01:43:59,274 --> 01:44:01,859
We gotta protect the laser.
Come on. Come on!

1359
01:44:03,779 --> 01:44:05,321
Santos!

1360
01:44:15,624 --> 01:44:17,124
Son of a bitch!

1361
01:44:19,670 --> 01:44:22,630
-That hurt!
-Cover me, Lockett!

1362
01:44:28,011 --> 01:44:31,389
The drones are pulling it away!
We gotta take it out now!

1363
01:44:35,018 --> 01:44:37,311
Incoming Copperhead!

1364
01:44:42,025 --> 01:44:44,860
They're using the drone
to protect the ship!

1365
01:44:48,407 --> 01:44:50,157
I'm running low on ammo!

1366
01:44:50,367 --> 01:44:51,784
Santos!

1367
01:44:56,081 --> 01:44:59,125
-How is he?
-He's hanging in there, staff sergeant!

1368
01:44:59,334 --> 01:45:01,460
Crazy bastard.
You should've left me there.

1369
01:45:06,133 --> 01:45:07,633
Covering!

1370
01:45:08,552 --> 01:45:09,760
Grenade!

1371
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:19,061
-Staff sergeant!
-We are not dying here, Lockett!

1372
01:45:19,312 --> 01:45:21,355
You damn right we're not dying!

1373
01:45:22,858 --> 01:45:25,109
It's getting out of range!
I gotta take it down!

1374
01:45:25,318 --> 01:45:27,319
Doesn't have enough punch!
Save that shot!

1375
01:45:36,913 --> 01:45:38,706
Staff sergeant!

1376
01:45:38,915 --> 01:45:40,207
Lockett, you okay?

1377
01:45:40,417 --> 01:45:42,376
Harris, you're gonna be okay.

1378
01:46:06,777 --> 01:46:09,111
There's the last Copperhead.

1379
01:46:12,949 --> 01:46:15,576
Santos, take out that drone!

1380
01:46:17,954 --> 01:46:19,705
Firing!

1381
01:46:36,640 --> 01:46:38,182
-Yeah!
-We did it!

1382
01:46:40,393 --> 01:46:44,313
We did it!

1383
01:46:49,653 --> 01:46:52,530
I can't believe it worked!

1384
01:46:58,662 --> 01:47:00,371
Yeah!

1385
01:47:00,580 --> 01:47:02,206
Staff sergeant, you did it!

1386
01:47:04,501 --> 01:47:07,503
There's nothing controlling
the drones anymore!

1387
01:47:14,094 --> 01:47:15,928
Marines, on me!

1388
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:30,901
They're retreating. Advance!

1389
01:48:41,556 --> 01:48:43,432
You guys saved our lives out there!

1390
01:48:43,642 --> 01:48:45,517
Semper Fi, Two-Five!

1391
01:48:45,769 --> 01:48:49,146
-All right, Two-Five!
-Retreat, hell!

1392
01:48:49,356 --> 01:48:52,024
You kicked ass, staff sarge!
Welcome home!

1393
01:48:52,943 --> 01:48:56,195
-Move! Move! Move!
-Good work, Marines! Outstanding.

1394
01:48:56,780 --> 01:48:58,656
Your civilians are safe.

1395
01:48:58,865 --> 01:49:01,450
Word of how you brought
their ship down...

1396
01:49:01,618 --> 01:49:04,328
...is going out to every army
in every city.

1397
01:49:04,537 --> 01:49:08,540
We're mustering up whatever troops
we can get and going back in.

1398
01:49:08,792 --> 01:49:10,834
So get out of that gear.

1399
01:49:11,419 --> 01:49:12,628
Get some chow in you.

1400
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:14,964
There's breakfast in the tent.

1401
01:49:15,173 --> 01:49:18,592
You earned it. Hoorah, Two-Five.

1402
01:50:07,058 --> 01:50:08,559
-Get some smoke, Imlay.
-Got you.

1403
01:50:08,768 --> 01:50:10,978
Got grenades over here.
Anybody need?

1404
01:50:11,187 --> 01:50:15,399
-Got frag rounds coming down.
-Imlay, I think you could use this.

1405
01:50:15,608 --> 01:50:18,527
-Got it. HE rounds.
-I need a couple more magazines.

1406
01:50:18,737 --> 01:50:20,988
-Very nice, very nice.
-Everybody got ammo?

1407
01:50:21,197 --> 01:50:22,656
Yes, staff sergeant.

1408
01:50:23,074 --> 01:50:25,576
What do you think you're doing,
staff sergeant?

1409
01:50:26,369 --> 01:50:28,620
We already had breakfast, sir.

1410
01:50:37,714 --> 01:50:39,548
I'll be borrowing this, sir.

1411
01:50:39,799 --> 01:50:41,216
Carry on.

1412
01:50:42,344 --> 01:50:44,386
-Retreat, hell!
-Hoorah!

1413
01:50:45,555 --> 01:50:47,556
This is Bullpen 2-3. Who's with me?

1414
01:50:47,807 --> 01:50:50,059
Morning, Bullpen.
Dog Pound 2-1, on your left.

1415
01:50:50,226 --> 01:50:52,269
Good to hear a friendly voice,
Dog Pound 2-1.

1416
01:50:52,437 --> 01:50:54,396
Liberty 1-1,
Snake Eyes joining the fight.

1417
01:50:54,564 --> 01:50:56,315
Yankee-Foxtrot-2-1,
we're on your six.

1418
01:50:56,483 --> 01:50:58,567
-Morning, Dog Pound 2-1.
-Eagle on your right.

1419
01:50:58,735 --> 01:51:03,030
This is Foxtrot-Two-November.
Let's take back Los Angeles.
