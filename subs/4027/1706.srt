00:00:32,292 --> 00:00:33,917
那一刻
<i>Moments...</i>

3
00:00:34,292 --> 00:00:35,917
这就是那一刻
<i>This is one.</i>

4
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:39,958
就在这儿，就现在，就是那一刻
<i>This right here, right now,is definitely a moment.</i>

5
00:00:40,042 --> 00:00:41,583
泰萨？
Tessa?

6
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,417
下一秒什么事都有可能发生
<i>Anything could happen next.</i>

7
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,083
泰萨？-干吗？
- Tessa? - What?

8
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:47,542
你都没听我说话
You're not listening to me.

9
00:00:47,667 --> 00:00:49,125
我听着呢
I am listening to you.

10
00:00:49,167 --> 00:00:50,833
那我刚才说什么了？
What did I just say?

11
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:52,667
我没听
I wasn't listening to you.

12
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,167
我是说，今晚对你很重要
I'm saying this is a big night for you.

13
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:56,125
清单上的第一项
Number one on the list.

14
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:57,750
根本就没有什么清单
There is no list.

15
00:00:57,792 --> 00:00:59,083
那你就做一份呗
You were gonna make a list.

16
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:00,625
我都没开始弄呢
I haven't started.

17
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:03,917
那就现在开始弄，赶紧的
Then start now. Go on.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,083
好吧，那你喜欢哪个？我是一点都不在乎
Right. So, which one do you want? Because I really don't mind.

19
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:12,250
金发的那个
The blond one.

20
00:01:12,292 --> 00:01:14,000
金发的？你确定吗？
The blond one? You're sure?

21
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:16,375
你想要他？我说过，我不在乎，不过……
You want him? Like I said, I don't mind. Just...

22
00:01:16,542 --> 00:01:17,958
你可以选金发的那个
You can have the blond one.

23
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:19,500
只要你同意
Only if you're sure.

24
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:24,750
邹……怎么了？亲爱的
Zo...What, babe?

25
00:01:25,042 --> 00:01:29,792
如果我跟那个谁那个了……我不知道，我会不会变成人渣？
If I do this with someone I don't know, does that make me a slag?

26
00:01:31,542 --> 00:01:33,333
这能让你觉得自己还活着
It makes you alive.

27
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:53,250
那，你们经常去那家俱乐部吗？
So, that club, are you guys regulars there?

28
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,917
不是啊，你呢？
No. You?

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,333
有时候去，你知道的
Sometimes, you know.

30
00:01:57,958 --> 00:01:59,333
对
Right.

31
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,125
还有什么别的地方可去吗？
Is there anywhere else we can go?

32
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:14,417
想来杯茶吗？或者咖啡？
Do you want a cup of tea? Or coffee?

33
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:17,958
好啊，都行
Sure, yeah. Either.

34
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,167
其实我们没有咖啡了
We haven't actually got any coffee.

35
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,417
好
Okay.

36
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,333
茶我也没找着
I can't find the tea.

37
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:27,917
我喝水就行了
Water's fine.

38
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:46,083
那，你最喜欢的……
So, what's your favorite...

39
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,250
你是想亲我吗？
Do you want to kiss me?

40
00:02:49,042 --> 00:02:50,500
天呐，是啊
God, yeah.

41
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,792
天呐！没事
Jesus Christ! It's okay.

42
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,500
我滴个妈呀！没事的
Jesus bloody Christ! It's fine.

43
00:03:13,042 --> 00:03:14,042
怎么了？
What happened?

44
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,625
这姑娘的脑袋……她的头套掉到我手上了
This girl's head... Her head came off in my hand!

45
00:03:18,417 --> 00:03:20,250
你们笑什么呀？这有什么可笑的？
What are you laughing at? It's not funny.

46
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,458
差点把我尿吓出来，喔！
Scared the piss out of me.Whoo!

47
00:03:39,292 --> 00:03:41,917
那，你是经常化妆出门吗？
So, do you often go out in disguise?

48
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,083
戴着假发什么的
The hair hat and all.

49
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,458
原先老戴，那会儿我病了
I got given it. I was ill.

50
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:51,583
那你现在好点了吗？
Are you better now?

51
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,292
好多了
All better.

52
00:04:14,042 --> 00:04:15,042
哦
Oh.

53
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,917
不再多来点儿前戏啦？
Aren't we supposed to do that for a bit longer?

54
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,750
我现在就准备好了
I'm ready now.

55
00:04:23,917 --> 00:04:26,375
等会儿，等会儿，你能先听我说吗？
Wait, wait. Can you just look at me for one second?

56
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:29,917
这是我的第一次
This is my first time.

57
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,417
喔~ 惊了
Wow. That's amazing.

58
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:34,125
很显然你不是
Obviously it's not yours.

59
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,500
别说了
Stop talking now.

60
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:39,208
唉，这样不行
Yeah, not like this.

61
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,375
怎么了？
What?

62
00:04:41,417 --> 00:04:44,250
对不起，我不想
Sorry. Not gonna happen.

63
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,083
你是耍我呢吗？你大老远来了，还……
You're shitting me. You come this far, and...

64
00:04:48,167 --> 00:04:50,333
真对不起
I'm sorry. Really.

65
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,750
随便吧
Whatever.

66
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,375
好吧
Okay.

67
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,458
好吧
Okay.

68
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:23,667
我会爱你一生一世
<i> I will love you till the end of time</i>

69
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,625
我等了一百万年
<i> I would wait a million years</i>

70
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:32,125
答应我你会永远记得我的爱
<i> Promise you'll remember that you're mine</i>

71
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:35,375
亲爱的，透过这些眼泪
<i> Baby, can you see through the tears?</i>

72
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:38,917
你会看到我的爱胜过你以前那些傻逼娘们儿
<i> Love you more than those bitches before</i>

73
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,333
告诉我你不会忘，告诉我你永远记得
<i> Say you'll remember, Say you'll remember</i>

74
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,792
亲爱的
<i> Baby, who</i>

75
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:49,500
我会爱你直到永远
<i> I will love you till the end of time</i>

76
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:02,875
一夜好梦，冈斯特
<i> Big dreams, gangsta</i>

77
00:06:03,292 --> 00:06:06,708
你说你必须离开这儿开启你的事业
<i> Said you had to leave to start your life over</i>

78
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,750
我说求你了，别走
<i> I was like, no, please,</i>

79
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:15,000
别走，我们不需要钱，我们会把日子过起来的
<i> Stay here, we don't need no money, we could make it all work</i>

80
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,458
但是他还是在礼拜天走了
<i> But he headed out on Sunday</i>

81
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,417
他说他礼拜一就回来
<i> Said he'd come home Monday</i>

82
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:22,792
我夜不能寐，一直等待着，期盼着，焦虑着
<i> I stay up waitin', anticipatin', and pacing'</i>

83
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:27,000
但他一心想着赚钱
<i> But he was chasing paper</i>

84
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:31,583
最后一次听到他的消息是他正沉湎于游戏之中
<i> Caught up in the game that was the last I heard</i>

85
00:06:34,542 --> 00:06:38,708
我会爱你直到永远
<i> I will love you till the end of time</i>

86
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:42,667
等你一百万年
<i> I would wait a million years</i>

87
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:47,125
别忘了我的爱
<i> Promise you'll remember that you're mine</i>

88
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:50,417
亲爱的，透过我的眼泪
<i> Baby, can you see through the tears?</i>

89
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:53,875
你会看到我的爱胜过你以前那些傻逼娘们儿
<i> Love you more than those bitches before</i>

90
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:57,292
告诉我你不会忘，告诉我你会记得
<i> Say you'll remember, Say you'll remember</i>

91
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,833
亲爱的
<i> Baby, who</i>

92
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:03,250
我会爱你直到永远
<i> I will love you till the end of time</i>

93
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:08,125
爱你胜过你那些傻逼娘们儿
<i> Love you more than those bitches before</i>

94
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:11,750
告诉我你不会忘，告诉我你会记得
<i> Say you'll remember, Say you'll remember</i>

95
00:07:11,792 --> 00:07:13,083
亲爱的
<i> Baby, who</i>

96
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:17,333
我会爱你直到永远
<i> I will love you till the end of time </i>

97
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,250
谢谢，谢谢你
Thanks. Thank you.

98
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,250
我不明白，我就是不明白
I don't understand it. I just don't get it.

99
00:07:32,292 --> 00:07:33,792
你以前什么都跟我说
You always tell me everything.

100
00:07:33,917 --> 00:07:35,458
我从来没有什么事都跟你说
I never tell you anything.

101
00:07:35,792 --> 00:07:38,583
你为什么现在不说了呢？你昨晚都干吗了？
Why don't you start now? What were you doing last night?

102
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,250
继续问吧，爸爸，第15次一定能问出来
Keep asking, Dad.The 15th time is the charm.

103
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,708
嗨，我是卡洛琳，理查德的经纪人，咱们通过电话
Hi, I'm Caroline, Richard's producer.We spoke on the phone.

104
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,958
嗨，很高兴见到你
Hi. Good to meet you in person.

105
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,708
这位一定是泰萨
And this must be Tessa.

106
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,583
是我
That's me!

107
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:55,167
电梯坏了，她走楼梯没问题吧？
The lift's not working. Can she manage the stairs?

108
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:56,875
行啊，她没问题
Yeah, she'll be fine.

109
00:07:57,042 --> 00:07:58,042
好
Okay.

110
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:02,417
泰萨·斯科特和她的爸爸来了
Tessa Scott and her father.

111
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:05,750
嗨，你们好。请坐。-你好
- Hi, guys. Take a seat.- Hello.

112
00:08:06,292 --> 00:08:07,542
我们很高兴能被请到这来
Really pleased to be here.

113
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:08,917
是啊，我们是你的超级粉
Yeah, we're big fans.

114
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,792
很好，咱们只是聊聊天
Great. We'll just have a little chat.

115
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,917
尽量放松，我会帮你们把话题说完的，好吗？
Be as natural as you can and I'll help you through. Okay?

116
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,417
那，你从什么角度切入呢？
So, what's your angle going to be?

117
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:16,667
是从要死的女孩的角度呢
Is it the whole dying girl thing,

118
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,250
还是说你有什么别的切入点？
or do you have something original planned?

119
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,583
什么？
Sorry?

120
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,042
泰萨
Tessa.

121
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,792
我知道这是个沉重的话题，但是咱们试着让它积极点，好吗？
I know it's heavy stuff, but let's try to keep it upbeat. Yeah?

122
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:29,250
现在，我很荣幸地为大家介绍今天的嘉宾
And now I'm delighted to have as my guest in the studio

123
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:33,125
一个非常勇敢的姑娘，泰萨·斯科特
a very brave young lady indeed, Tessa Scott.

124
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:36,250
泰萨已经与白血病斗争了四年
Tessa's been living with leukemia for the past four years,

125
00:08:36,292 --> 00:08:38,625
她和她的父亲将为我们讲述这个故事
and she's here with her dad to talk about it.

126
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,708
跟我们说说，你第一次意识到泰萨病了是什么时候？
Tell us, when did you realize that Tessa was first ill?

127
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,333
四年前
Four years ago.

128
00:08:43,417 --> 00:08:45,417
她得了，我和泰萨的妈妈当时觉得
She had, well,we thought it was the flu,

129
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,750
她只是得了感冒
Tessa's mum and I.

130
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,417
但是这感冒老也不好
But the flu just wouldn't clear up.

131
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,125
验血报告证实了我们最坏的预测结果
The blood test confirmed our worst fears.

132
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,792
大夫跟我们说
The doctors told us they couldn't

133
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:55,500
他们对泰萨的病不抱任何希望
hold out any hope for her survival,

134
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,042
这就意味着让泰萨觉得
which brought us to the point where

135
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:58,625
自己除了化疗之外
Tessa felt like she had no choice

136
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,917
没有别的选择了
but to end her chemotherapy entirely.

137
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,417
泰萨，你后来选择了放弃治疗
Tessa, you chose to give up the treatment.

138
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,250
这对于一个17岁的孩子来说是个重大决定
That's a big decision for a 17-year-old.

139
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,417
我想如果……
If I may...

140
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,583
参与积极的治疗
The more aggressive treatments,

141
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:09,625
仅仅能够稍微……
they would have only slightly

142
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,375
延长泰萨的生命
prolonged Tessa's life.

143
00:09:11,542 --> 00:09:13,625
还有其他的治疗方法
There are other ways to maintain her health.

144
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,417
爸……-比如说，有研究证明……
Dad... - For example, studies have shown

145
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:18,250
好的营养品能够将体内的白血球系统重新平衡
that good nutrition can rebalance a system entirely.

146
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,750
这就是我们来这的真正原因，让大家提高对白血病的认识，而且……
That's why we're here really, to raise awareness, and...

147
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:21,833
爸……怎么了？
Dad... What?

148
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,667
他知道总会有那么一天
He's gonna have to stop sometime.

149
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,458
哪么一天，泰萨？
Stop what, Tessa?

150
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,375
他知道最后我还是会死
He knows it's gonna happen.

151
00:09:30,417 --> 00:09:32,250
但是他从来没有放弃希望
But he can't stop hoping that it won't.

152
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,417
如果我继续化疗
It's true that if I kept going with the chemo,

153
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,833
确实能让我多活几年
I'd probably live a bit longer.

154
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,167
但是那让我感觉太糟糕了
But it made me feel so bad.

155
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,292
在我死前还有些事要做
And there are things I want to do before I die.

156
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:47,583
什么事？
Things?

157
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:51,292
我列了个清单
Yeah. I've got a list.

158
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
哦，你爸爸没提到过这个
Oh. Your dad didn't mention that.

159
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,833
那是因为他不知道
That's 'cause he doesn't know about it.

160
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,292
大部分都是违法的
Most of what's on it is illegal.

161
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,250
我都不敢问了
I'm almost scared to ask.

162
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,833
我昨天晚上差点和人发生性关系
Well, I nearly had sex last night,

163
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,208
技术上而言，这肯定是犯法的
which isn't actually technically against the law of course,

164
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:05,375
但是那感觉太差了，那哥们真应该为此被抓起来
but it was so crap the guy should be arrested anyway.

165
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,583
好了，我想我们的结束时间快要到了
Okay, I think that's all we've got time for.

166
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,917
我下一个计划是吸毒
Next I'm planning to take drugs.

167
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,167
你能给我介绍一种毒品吗？
Do you have any advice which ones?

168
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,250
别说了，泰萨
That's enough, Tessa.

169
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,750
很令人惊讶啊
Very amusing.

170
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:14,583
性，毒品和摇滚乐
Sex and drugs and rock 'n' roll.

171
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,625
女士们先生们，我想你们也有同感
Ladies and gents,I think you'll agree

172
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,750
这是一个勇敢面对生活的姑娘
there is a young lady taking life by the horns.

173
00:10:19,792 --> 00:10:21,625
非常感谢，泰萨和她的父亲
Thank you very much,Tessa and her dad.

174
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:23,542
谢谢你
Thank you.

175
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:26,583
接下来是天气情况，今儿早上的大风
And now the weather.Squally this morning,

176
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,542
会一直持续到下午，
rounding up this afternoon and clearing

177
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,167
而本周接下来几天会放晴
for the rest of the week.

178
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,042
她出去了。-没有
She's out.-No.

179
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,292
爸
Dad...

180
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:41,750
等等
Wait.

181
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,333
没睡好？
Bad night?

182
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:47,708
没事儿
There's no such thing.

183
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,292
你好啊，亲爱的，请进
Hello, darlings. Come on in.

184
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:50,750
嘿，妈妈
Hi, Mum.

185
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:52,750
你怎那么颓啊
You look stressed.

186
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:55,458
都赖她。我四点来接他们
Blame her. Back at 4:00.

187
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:05,083
这是个新把戏，我能把硬币变没
It's a new trick, Mum. I can make a coin disappear.

188
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,458
你想看吗？
Do you want to see it?

189
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:07,833
不想，亲爱的，我想先喝点咖啡
No, darling. Not before coffee.

190
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:11,875
喝咖啡之前我什么都不想干。去给你姐姐看吧
Nothing before the coffee. Show your sister.

191
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,500
她对我这些戏法从来都不感兴趣。
She's never interested. She doesn't care.

192
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,292
她肯定感兴趣
I'm sure she does.

193
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,125
我真没兴趣
I really don't.

194
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,292
要不你去看看动画片什么的吧
Why don't you go and watch CBeebies or something?

195
00:11:20,917 --> 00:11:22,500
就因为我才九岁
Because I'm nine.

196
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,417
我听见你在广播里做的节目了
I heard you on the radio.

197
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:30,208
你有男朋友了
You met a boy.

198
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:33,208
泰萨，你得跟我保证一定要戴套
Tessa, promise me you'll always use a condom.

199
00:11:35,542 --> 00:11:37,042
我知道那小橡胶套挺讨厌的
I know the smell of rubber can be off-putting,

200
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,125
但是不戴的话会得淋病的
but, then, so is gonorrhea.

201
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:41,875
别说了，你搞得我很恐慌
Please stop. My panic attack is having a panic attack.

202
00:11:43,542 --> 00:11:45,125
不要滥交
And don't have casual sex.

203
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:47,833
是么？
Really?

204
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:49,042
是的，亲爱的
No, darling.

205
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,792
你一定一定要很努力才行
You must always, always try as hard as you can.

206
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:58,917
我想去纹个身
I've got to get a tattoo.

207
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:00,375
我也想纹
And I want one and all.

208
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,250
纹满全身的那种
Over my whole body, of myself.

209
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,875
我想再长高点，胸部再大点
And taller, with bigger tits.

210
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:07,875
怎么了？
What's up?

211
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,167
他真是个大骗子
He's such a bloody liar.

212
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,750
谁呀？-斯科特
Who? Scott.

213
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,875
他说他在这有个摊位
Said he had a stall here.

214
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,542
我们来这儿就为这个？
Is that why we came?

215
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:15,917
真不敢相信他居然放我鸽子
I can't believe he'd blow me off.

216
00:12:16,042 --> 00:12:17,375
是我让他活得还有点意思
I gave him the ride of his life.

217
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,625
邹，-卑鄙的东西
Zo... -Wanker.

218
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:19,750
小邹……-干吗？
Zo... -What?

219
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,583
他在那呢
He's right there.

220
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,958
嘿，帅哥
Hey, handsome.

221
00:12:26,042 --> 00:12:27,042
怎么样？
What's up?

222
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:30,125
我不知道，取决于你
I don't know. You tell me.

223
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,458
就看你怎么表现了
Or better yet, show me.

224
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,750
嘿
Hey.

225
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,375
嘿
Hey.

226
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,583
你好吗？
How are you?

227
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,583
我挺好
I'm fine.

228
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:43,917
那天晚上把你晾在那我真是……
I know I left you hanging the other night and I just wanted...

229
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,083
没事，是我不对
No, it was my fault.

230
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,708
什么？
What?

231
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,333
我就是……我应该多来点前戏……
I just...I could've been a bit more...

232
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,583
她跟你说了
She told you.

233
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,125
什么？
What?

234
00:12:54,292 --> 00:12:57,292
是你说的，是不是？你跟他说了我的事
You did, didn't you? You told him about me.

235
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,667
你不应该说出去
Shouldn't have done that.

236
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,583
泰萨，等等
Tessa, wait!

237
00:13:02,417 --> 00:13:03,875
泰萨
Tessa!

238
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,583
嘿，错过午饭了
Hey. You missed lunch.

239
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:31,125
你自己吃吧
You eat it.

240
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:39,750
你这是干吗呢？
What are you doing with all this?

241
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,792
隔壁在院子生火呢
There's a bonfire in the garden next door.

242
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:47,042
别扔了，求你别扔了
Don't do that. Please don't do that.

243
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:49,875
你要是不想要这些东西给我
If you don't want these things, I do.

244
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:52,208
那是在西班牙，你当时在恢复期
That's Spain. You were in remission.

245
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,417
有个小子冲我吹口哨，你还挺高兴
A boy whistled at me, and you took that.

246
00:13:57,667 --> 00:13:59,500
你说我应该永远记得第一个对我吹口哨的人
Said I'd never want to forget my first whistle.

247
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:01,958
是啊
Yeah.

248
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,250
但是我不想记得
But I do.

249
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,000
你这是干吗呀？
What are you doing?

250
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,292
你不介意吧？
Do you mind?

251
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,292
无所谓
Feel very free.

252
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,875
我是亚当
I'm Adam.

253
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,500
你是泰萨吧
And you're Tessa.

254
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,417
搬过来之后老能在附近看见你
I've seen you around,since we moved here.

255
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,250
我本来想自我介绍来着，但是……
I meant to introduce myself, but...

256
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,583
这不是情书
They're not love letters.

257
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:15,083
这跟我没关系
It's none of my business.

258
00:15:15,417 --> 00:15:17,083
我是说，我没有被谁甩了之类的事
I'm just saying. I didn't get dumped or anything.

259
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,833
我也没那么想
I wouldn't have thought so.

260
00:15:23,042 --> 00:15:25,708
我还有别的东西要烧
Anyway,I've got more stuff to burn.

261
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,167
行啊，烧吧
Cool, whack it on.

262
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,333
这个也得烧
This is going.

263
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:38,208
烧了更好，穿着这个裙子很危险
Probably best. That's a dangerous dress.

264
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:44,833
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

265
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,250
泰萨？
Tessa?

266
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:02,958
好了，别动，别动，你刚才晕过去了
All right, don't move. Don't move. I think you fainted.

267
00:16:03,292 --> 00:16:04,792
你有糖尿病吗？
Are you diabetic?

268
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,917
要不要吃糖？
Do you need sugar?

269
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,375
我这有汽水
Have some of this.

270
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,333
汽水都没气儿了
It's flat.

271
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:15,708
你可真难缠
You're tough to please.

272
00:16:15,792 --> 00:16:18,375
你这口气就跟想和我上床似的
You say that like it's a bad thing.

273
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:22,500
好了，很好，不尴尬，一点都不尴尬
Okay, excellent. Not embarrassed, not embarrassed at all.

274
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,458
对，没事，对吧？
No, it's cool, all right?

275
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,958
我是说，我还从来没遇到过这种情况呢
I mean, I've never had that effect on someone before.

276
00:16:27,042 --> 00:16:28,792
没事
I kind of like it.

277
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,292
这花园真漂亮
This is a nice garden.

278
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:36,750
谢谢，这都是我弄的，我想让我妈妈高兴
Thanks. It's kind of my thing. It keeps my mum happy.

279
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,042
你爸呢？
How about your dad?

280
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,583
只有我跟我妈我们俩
It's just the two of us.

281
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,000
我得回去了。-好，你要我扶你吗？
I should get home. -All right. You need help?

282
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,667
又不远
It's not exactly far.

283
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:50,458
那，下回你要是还有什么要烧的话……
So, anytime you've got something to burn...

284
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,208
或者我想在谁面前晕倒的话……
Or I just want to pass out in front of someone...

285
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,792
你可以来找我
You know where to come.

286
00:16:56,542 --> 00:16:57,833
是啊，我知道
Yes, I do.

287
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:10,250
泰萨死了之后，咱们能去度假吗？
When Tessa dies, can we go on holiday?

288
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,750
卡尔，你怎么这么说话啊
Cal, that's an awful thing to say.

289
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,500
上次去西班牙我都不记得了
I don't even remember going to Spain.

290
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,042
那都多久以前的事儿了，我都怀疑咱们到底去没去过那
It was so long ago,it might not even be true.

291
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:19,667
卡尔，别说了，回你房间去
Cal, that's enough.Go to your room.

292
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,125
爸。-怎么了？
Dad...-What's wrong?

293
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,458
出去！
Get out!

294
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:23,917
我说错什么了？
What did I say that was wrong?

295
00:17:28,042 --> 00:17:29,250
真让人想不通
It's all very confusing.

296
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:31,167
那就别想了
No, it's not.

297
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,667
今天都是你的
This is your day.

298
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,458
什么意思？
And what does that mean?

299
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,875
你想干什么我都陪着你
That I'll do whatever you want.

300
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:38,542
再买点东西行吗？
Buy more things?

301
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:39,875
当然了
Sure.

302
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,500
你哪来的钱？
Where does the money come from?

303
00:17:42,042 --> 00:17:43,208
姐有信用卡
A credit card.

304
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,042
现在买，回头再付账
Buy now, pay later.

305
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,875
或者，知道么，不付也行
Or you know, not.

306
00:17:48,042 --> 00:17:50,542
看着点你那飞机，差点捅着人眼睛
Watch where you're flying. You almost poked the guy's eye out.

307
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:51,875
我真希望自己也能飞一飞
I wish I could fly for real.

308
00:17:52,542 --> 00:17:53,583
是吗？
Yeah?

309
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:08,208
太棒啦！
Amazing!

310
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,542
这是我玩过的最好玩的了！
That was better than the best thing ever!

311
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,000
我能再玩一次吗？
Can I go again?

312
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,500
我觉得应该让你姐姐玩一次了
I think it's your sister's go.

313
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:18,292
没事，我看看就行了
I'm good, I'm just watching.

314
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,750
真的吗？-对
Are you sure? -Yeah.

315
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,417
她得病了，不能玩这种东西
She's sick. She can't do this kind of thing.

316
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:25,042
好吧，小兄弟，咱们再来一次
All right, mate, well, let's get you hooked up again.

317
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:28,208
要不然，那什么
Actually, you know what?

318
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,875
我也玩一次得了
I will have a crack.

319
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,708
准备好了吗？-准备好了！
Ready? -Ready.

320
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,417
泰萨，我觉得你还是不应该玩这个
Tessa, I don't know if this is a good idea.

321
00:19:04,792 --> 00:19:05,833
她没事吧？
Is she okay?

322
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:06,958
她没事
She's fine.

323
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:09,250
她只是不想停下来而已
She just doesn't want it to end.

324
00:19:19,042 --> 00:19:20,917
那不是你的钱
It wasn't your money.

325
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,625
她迟到了
She's late.

326
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,500
你听见我说话了吗？
Do you hear what I'm saying?

327
00:19:24,542 --> 00:19:25,750
她说她肯定来的
She promised she'd come.

328
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,375
泰萨
Tessa...

329
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,792
你要让卡尔把所有东西都退回去吗？
Do you want Cal to return everything?

330
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,000
为什么要惩罚他呢？
Why should he be punished?

331
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,958
你这是干吗呀？
What are you doing?

332
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:35,125
这是你那张清单上的事吗？
Is this to do with your list?

333
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,208
我根本没列清单
I don't have a list.

334
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,042
你跟电台主播说你列了张单子
You told that radio guy you had a list.

335
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,417
那是一个傻逼
He was a knob.

336
00:19:39,542 --> 00:19:40,917
是啊，他是挺傻逼的
Yeah, he was a knob.

337
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,250
你宁愿跟一个傻逼说实话都不愿意跟我说
You were still more honest with him than you are with me.

338
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,625
你让我心里怎么想？
How do you think that makes me feel?

339
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,083
我才不在乎你怎么想呢
I don't give a crap how you feel.

340
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:49,583
她不会来了，咱们先去吧
She's not coming.Let's do this.

341
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:58,708
泰萨，我现在要给你打麻醉剂
Tessa, there'll be a slight pinch and burn,

342
00:19:59,042 --> 00:20:02,125
会有点疼，忍着点，好吗？
then the anesthetic will kick in. All right?

343
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,417
很好
Good.

344
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,792
现在，我要把它轻轻晃动几下
Now, I wiggle up and down

345
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,875
管子会穿透插入点的皮下组织
to break the tissue around the insertion point.

346
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,083
她会感到胸腔有被拉扯的感觉
She may feel a slight tugging across the chest,

347
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,125
但是当管子从接口处分离的时候
but once the line detaches from the cuff,

348
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,708
它就会滑走
it will simply slide away.

349
00:20:17,042 --> 00:20:19,542
现在，我可以重新插入导管了
Now, of course I can reinsert the catheter

350
00:20:19,667 --> 00:20:21,667
你确定要重新开始化疗吗？
should you wish to recommence your treatment.

351
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,792
现在改主意还来得及
I'm saying you can change your mind.

352
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,667
不改了
I won't change my mind.

353
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,792
父亲怎么说？
Dad?

354
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,042
她不会改主意了
She won't change her mind.

355
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,375
好吧
All right then.

356
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,750
按住
Hold that for me.

357
00:20:43,292 --> 00:20:44,375
好姑娘
Good girl.

358
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,833
要不你直接拍我屁股得了
Do you want to slap my rump?

359
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,542
什么？不
What? No.

360
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,083
那就别把我当匹马那样跟我说话
Then don't talk to me like I'm a horse.

361
00:20:53,042 --> 00:20:54,875
好吧
Yes.

362
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:56,958
抱歉
Sorry.

363
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,958
嘿，完事了，都弄完了
Hey, it's done now. It's done.

364
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,500
你知道都应该注意哪些症状吗？
You know what to look out for?

365
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:13,292
知道，发冷，发热，脖子僵硬，头疼
Yeah. Chill, fever,stiff neck or headache.

366
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:16,083
出汗，出血，体力流失
Drainage, bleeding,loss of strength.

367
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,875
很好
You're good.

368
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,708
感谢你的帮助
Thanks for all your help.

369
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:23,917
她看上你了
She likes you.

370
00:21:24,042 --> 00:21:25,333
得了吧
I doubt that.

371
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,500
真的，你心跳都加快了
I mean it. You're bang in there.

372
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:30,000
你真应该约她出来或者干点别的什么的
You should definitely ask her out or something.

373
00:21:30,042 --> 00:21:34,000
泰萨，泰萨，等等，我在这儿，我这就下来，别走
Tessa! Tessa, wait, I'm here.I'm coming. Stay there.

374
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:43,000
哦，天呐，我错过手术了吗？我出来得还算及时啊
Oh, God, did I miss it? I left on time.

375
00:21:43,042 --> 00:21:45,375
主要是堵车误在路上了
But there was this insane traffic.

376
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,833
我出来得真不晚，我就是……
I definitely left on time.I just...

377
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,583
是啊，随便你怎么说吧
Sure, whatever.

378
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:50,833
泰萨
Tessa...

379
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,167
我不在乎
I don't care.

380
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,667
哦，别这样
Oh, don't be like that.

381
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:56,000
那你想让她哪样啊？
How do you expect her to be?

382
00:21:56,042 --> 00:21:57,917
抱歉，这跟你有什么关系？
I'm sorry, this has what to do with you?

383
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,667
你真想知道吗？-是啊我想……
Is that a serious question? -Yes, it's a serious...

384
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,208
行了
Enough.

385
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,875
你们俩都挺操蛋的
You both suck.

386
00:22:03,917 --> 00:22:05,917
一个是癌症观察者
One of you is this cancer obsessive,

387
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,208
另外一个连面儿都不肯露
and the other can't even face showing up

388
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,458
这就够了
at the hospital, which is fine,

389
00:22:09,042 --> 00:22:10,750
我懂了
I get it.

390
00:22:10,792 --> 00:22:12,792
但是你们俩我都不需要
But neither of you are what I need.

391
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,917
你们只是在浪费我的时间
You're just wasting my time.

392
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,625
我是说……-你甭说了
All I'm saying... -This is not gonna be all you say.

393
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:27,125
我是说……-根本不是那么回事儿
All I'm saying is...-There'll be another thing.

394
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:30,125
我的意思是，你不用整天围着我转
All I'm saying is, you don't have to stay in on my account.

395
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:32,083
你应该出去多跟你的朋友们玩一玩
You could go out and see your friends more often.

396
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:34,583
这就是我想说的。-好吧，好吧
And that's all I'm saying.-Okay. Okay.

397
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,750
我刚吸了毒
I've just taken drugs.

398
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:46,042
很好，来见见我妈妈
Excellent. Have you met my mum?

399
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:50,250
嗨
Hi.

400
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:51,375
嗨
Hi.

401
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,875
我只是吃了迷幻蘑菇，那是纯天然的
Mushrooms is all I did, which are natural.

402
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,792
也不是完全不合法
If not strictly legal.

403
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,458
我的朋友本来想买些克他命
My friend did buy some ketamine,

404
00:22:59,542 --> 00:23:00,917
但是她觉得那个卖毒品的人太讨厌了
but she thought the dealer was a bit skanky,

405
00:23:01,042 --> 00:23:04,375
所以我们用迷幻蘑菇代替了
so we've gone with the shrooms instead.

406
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:09,708
我先进屋了
See you inside.

407
00:23:13,417 --> 00:23:14,458
很好
That went well.

408
00:23:14,542 --> 00:23:15,542
我觉得也是
I thought so.

409
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:18,417
你吃了多少？
How much did you take?

410
00:23:18,542 --> 00:23:19,750
没多少
Not much.

411
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:21,917
我不知道，我对那些东西没什么了解
I don't know, I'm not really that clued up on the stuff.

412
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:23,083
是啊，我也不懂
Yeah, me neither.

413
00:23:23,542 --> 00:23:25,458
听着，我开车带你兜兜风，让你也醒醒毒
Look, I'll drive you somewhere. Keep you out of trouble.

414
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:27,417
我不知道药效多久才能发作
I'm not sure how long it takes to kick in.

415
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:36,458
那就是发作了吧
About that long.

00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:57,583
<i> The rocks in our hands
preparing for flight</i>

419
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:04,000
<i> The lack of sleeping
but it's all right</i>

420
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:07,917
<i> And it's all</i>

421
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:15,875
<i> And it's all right</i>

422
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:22,917
<i> And it's all</i>

423
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:28,917
<i> And it's all right</i>

424
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:36,250
<i> And it's all </i>

425
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:42,583
别害怕
Don't be afraid.

426
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:44,583
什么？怎么了？
What? -What?

427
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:47,917
你刚才说什么？
What did you say?

428
00:24:58,042 --> 00:24:59,417
好了，咱们可以在这儿待会儿
All right,we could hang out here.

429
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:02,083
周围没人，你们可以尽情地疯
There's no one around,so you guys can go crazy.

430
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,958
我不想疯
I don't want to go crazy.

431
00:25:04,042 --> 00:25:06,417
我根本就不想疯
I don't have to go crazy at all.

432
00:25:06,542 --> 00:25:08,625
我爬到上边来就行了
I'll just be up here.

433
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:10,292
你干吗呀？
What are you doing?

434
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:12,708
好了，下来
All right. Get down.

435
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,208
下来，别爬车顶。-我不
Come on, get down, off the roof.-No.

436
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,417
求求你，下来吧
Come on, get down. Please.

437
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:18,583
干吗？你要上来抓我？
Why? Are you gonna make me?

438
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:20,417
不是，我就跟你说，下来
No, I'm just gonna tell you. Get down.

439
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:24,792
好吧，我下来。-谢谢你
Fine. All right? -Thank you.

440
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:27,875
真烦人
Harshing my buzz.

441
00:25:28,417 --> 00:25:29,750
泰萨去哪了？
Where's Tessa?

442
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:31,250
什么？
What?

443
00:25:59,708 --> 00:26:01,208
咱们得跟着她
<i>We gotta go after her.</i>

444
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:03,417
谁知道她往哪走了？
We didn't see which way she went.

445
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:04,792
咱们得赶紧找到她
We need to find her. Now.

446
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:06,958
她会回来的，我说，这没什么大不了的
She'll come back. I mean, it's no big thing.

447
00:26:07,042 --> 00:26:08,625
咱们刚进林子，不会有危险的
We're just out here. There's no danger.

448
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:10,417
有，有危险
Yes, there is.

449
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:13,708
为什么？邹逸
Why? Zoey...

450
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:16,417
这时候我真不该告诉你
This time I'm really not supposed to tell you.

451
00:26:17,292 --> 00:26:19,583
告诉我什么？
Not supposed to tell me what?

452
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:22,125
泰萨
Tessa!

453
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:25,917
泰萨
Tessa!

454
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:32,083
泰萨
Tessa!

455
00:26:39,917 --> 00:26:41,250
泰萨
Tessa!

456
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:44,542
我发现一好东西
I've discovered something.

457
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:51,875
你没事吧？你自己能下来吗？
Are you okay? Can you get down?

458
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:55,083
我不想下去
I don't want to.

459
00:26:57,542 --> 00:26:59,542
好吧，等着
All right, just wait.

460
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:01,792
抓紧了，我这就来
Just hold on, I'm coming.

461
00:27:16,583 --> 00:27:18,083
要抓紧哦
Just hold on.

462
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:35,417
泰萨
Tessa...

463
00:27:35,792 --> 00:27:37,292
你快下来吧，求你
You need to come down now, please.

464
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:39,708
我扶着你咱俩一块下去
You need to let me help you climb down.

465
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:42,917
我想跟你说点事
I'm going to tell you something.

466
00:27:44,042 --> 00:27:46,917
但是你得保证不告诉别人，行吗？
But you have to promise not to tell anyone, okay?

467
00:27:51,542 --> 00:27:53,250
在这我的病全好了
I'm not sick here.

468
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:56,250
我再也不会得病了
I'm not sick anymore.

469
00:27:58,042 --> 00:28:00,792
我得待在这片林子里
I just need to stay here in this wood.

470
00:28:02,042 --> 00:28:06,042
我需要远离现代社会和所有那些玩意儿
I need to keep away from the modern world and all its gadgets

471
00:28:06,792 --> 00:28:08,917
这样我就不会病了
and then I won't be sick.

472
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:12,875
你要是愿意的话可以跟我在一起
You can stay with me if you want.

473
00:28:13,583 --> 00:28:15,083
你要是愿意的话我会很高兴的
I'd like it if you did.

474
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,583
咱们可以建个房子，修条小路
We'll build things,shelters and tracks.

475
00:28:20,042 --> 00:28:21,958
还可以种菜
We'll grow vegetables.

476
00:28:22,792 --> 00:28:24,417
咱们会很安全
We'll be safe.

477
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:28,958
泰萨……-不
Tessa...-No.

478
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:33,625
什么也别说
Please. Don't say anything.

479
00:28:51,042 --> 00:28:52,208
泰萨
Tessa?

480
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:54,000
干吗？
What?

481
00:28:54,542 --> 00:28:56,417
你要是死了我还是你弟弟吗？
Will I still be a brother when you're dead?

482
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,833
我不会走远的
I'll still be around.

483
00:29:02,042 --> 00:29:03,917
你会在我周围盘旋吗？
Are you going to haunt me?

484
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,125
你要是不愿意我就不盘旋了
Not if you don't want me to.

485
00:29:06,917 --> 00:29:08,750
我可能会有点害怕
Just I might be a bit scared.

486
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:12,458
护士来了，爸爸说你要准备好了就下来
The nurse is here. Dad says come down when you're ready.

487
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:25,500
蛋糕好吃吗？
Enjoying your cake?

488
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:26,917
嗯
Mmm.

489
00:29:26,958 --> 00:29:29,333
很好吃，谢谢你，泰萨
It's lovely.Thank you, Tessa.

490
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:32,000
我叫菲利帕
I'm Philippa.

491
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:36,792
你看上去不太舒服
You don't look like you're feeling too good.

492
00:29:37,167 --> 00:29:38,667
你舒服吗？
Would you be?

493
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,417
不是针对你的，她上礼拜跟上一个护士也这样
Take nothing personally. She was rude to last week's nurse, too.

494
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,458
好像叫肖恩
Sian, I think she was called.

495
00:29:46,542 --> 00:29:48,417
别假装不记得她的名字，爸爸
Don't pretend you've forgotten her name, Dad.

496
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,667
你还邀请人家留下吃晚饭呢，被人给撅了
You asked her to stay for supper. She said no.

497
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,583
我去隔壁房间
I'll be next door.

498
00:29:58,792 --> 00:30:00,917
他没有一件事做对的
He does everything wrong.

499
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:02,750
你有什么感觉？
How does that make you feel?

500
00:30:02,875 --> 00:30:04,292
他让我觉得可笑
It makes me laugh.

501
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:08,750
你知道么，有一个帮助组织
You know,there are support groups.

502
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,417
在那里你能认识很多跟你一样情况的人
Places you can meet people in the same position as you.

503
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:14,833
我去过一次
I went to one of those.

504
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:17,500
认识一个叫安吉拉的酷妞
Met a cool girl called Angela.

505
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:19,583
那你为什么不跟她聊聊呢？
So why not talk to her about all this?

506
00:30:19,792 --> 00:30:21,000
因为她死了
Because she died.

507
00:30:22,542 --> 00:30:23,833
那是我最后一次犯那种错误
Last time I make that mistake.

508
00:30:24,333 --> 00:30:25,417
完了吧？
Are we done?

509
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:38,792
嘿
Hey.

510
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:41,750
嘿
Hey.

511
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,958
你不用那么看着我
You don't have to look at me like that.

512
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:47,667
我只是快死了而已，又不传染
I'm just dying. It's not contagious.

513
00:30:49,417 --> 00:30:50,750
你今天感觉怎么样？
How are you feeling today?

514
00:30:50,875 --> 00:30:52,250
我能骑一圈吗？
Can I come for a ride?

515
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:54,917
你总是用问题回答问题吗？
Do you always answer a question with another question?

516
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:56,333
你觉得别扭吗？
Does that annoy you?

517
00:30:57,667 --> 00:30:59,417
出了点小毛病很棘手
Bit tricky to ride this at the minute.

518
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,167
我觉得我应该把发动机拆下来，该清洗了
I thought I'd strip the engine down, give it a clean.

519
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,333
那你现在装不回去了
And now you can't put it back together.

520
00:31:03,667 --> 00:31:05,417
你什么意思？我能啊，没问题的
What do you mean? I can, no trouble.

521
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:09,292
如果这个小玩意不重要的话
Just so long as this bit wasn't important.

522
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,958
你刚才说咱们要去哪来着？
Where did you say we were going again?

523
00:31:19,917 --> 00:31:21,292
我没说
I didn't.

524
00:31:23,667 --> 00:31:24,833
什么？
What?

525
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:43,083
横穿全国的徒步旅行。-真不错
A good long cross-country hike. -Excellent.

526
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:45,458
我的最大问题就是精力无处释放
Because my big problem is too much energy to burn.

527
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,417
就在那
Nearly there.

528
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,792
值得来一趟吧？
It's worth it, yeah?

529
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:05,083
值了
Yes.

530
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:16,750
你和你妈到底怎么回事？
So, what's the story with you and your mum?

531
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:19,292
我爸爸去年出车祸死了
My dad died last year.He was hit by a car.

532
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:25,583
那时候我刚考上大学，本可以住宿舍，但只能延期了
I had a place at college, but I had to defer it.

533
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:30,500
还是应该上学去
You should still go.

534
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:32,750
我不知道，我有点……
I don't know. I kind of...

535
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:36,583
我不知道我有没有做好心理准备
I'm not sure I was ready for it anyway.

536
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,500
你害怕吗？
Are you afraid?

537
00:32:47,625 --> 00:32:49,417
有时候怕
It comes and goes.

538
00:32:51,542 --> 00:32:52,750
好多人都觉得如果你得了病
Most people think that when you're sick

539
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:56,000
你就会变得无所畏惧
you become fearless and brave,

540
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:57,583
其实根本不是
but you don't.

541
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:04,458
大部分时间都会觉得被一个精神病人追着跑
Most of the time it's like being stalked by a psycho,

542
00:33:04,542 --> 00:33:07,083
随时都会被击倒
like I might get shot any second.

543
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:11,083
有时候，有那么几个小时我就会忘了这些
Sometimes I forget about it for hours.

544
00:33:11,833 --> 00:33:13,375
什么让你忘了这些呢？
What makes you forget?

545
00:33:15,292 --> 00:33:17,750
咱俩在森林里那颗大树上的时候
When I was with you in the wood,

546
00:33:18,792 --> 00:33:21,958
那整个下午我都没怎么想那些
I didn't think about it for the whole afternoon.

547
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:26,917
看着我
Look at me.

548
00:33:31,167 --> 00:33:33,500
我现在就没想
I'm not thinking about it now.

549
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:35,042
那你为什么不想走？
So, why don't you want to go?

550
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:36,583
我什么也不该说
I shouldn't have said anything.

551
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:38,583
精灵已经从神灯里出来了
Genie's out of the bottle now.

552
00:34:38,625 --> 00:34:39,833
这是谁的聚会？
Whose party is it?

553
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:41,167
不知道
I'm not sure.

554
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,542
你没被邀请吗？
You didn't get invited?

555
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:44,208
没有
That's not really how it works.

556
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:46,417
但是你所有的朋友都去了？
But all your mates are going?

557
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,042
我猜是吧
I guess, yeah.

558
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:50,958
我那不还没修完车呢么
I just haven't done this stuff in a while.

559
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,208
咱俩一块进去
Makes two of us.

560
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:10,750
嘿，你想在这儿玩吗？
Hey, so, do you just want to hang out here?

561
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:11,917
我去拿点喝的
I'll get us something to drink.

562
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,042
好
Yeah.

563
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,792
要不跟我一块来吧？
Or come with me?

564
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:26,417
我跟你一块去
I'll come with you.

565
00:35:37,292 --> 00:35:38,417
嘿，他在那呢
Hey, there he is!

566
00:35:38,542 --> 00:35:39,625
嘿，朋友们
Hi, guys...

567
00:35:39,708 --> 00:35:41,083
抱歉认错人了
Sorry to bother you,

568
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:42,417
我们的朋友
it's just we used to know someone

569
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,750
跟你这个朋友长得很像
who looked just like your friend here.

570
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:46,000
我叫泰萨，很高兴认识你
I'm Tessa. It's nice to meet you.

571
00:35:46,042 --> 00:35:47,542
如果你能让他从这出去
If you're the one that got him out of the house,

572
00:35:47,625 --> 00:35:48,750
那就也很高兴认识你
it's good to meet you, too.

573
00:35:48,792 --> 00:35:50,125
大学怎么样？
How's college?

574
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:51,750
你甚至都不用假装什么都学
You don't even have to pretend to learn anything.

575
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:53,750
你也应该试试。是啊，我会的，有机会吧
You should try it. Yeah, I will, sometime.

576
00:35:58,375 --> 00:35:59,375
你还喝这个吗？
Are you drinking this?

577
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:00,458
喝呀……
Yeah, actually...

578
00:36:06,042 --> 00:36:08,083
嗯，我觉得挺好，突然闯到一个聚会上去
Yeah, it's good, I think, just to pop in to parties like that.

579
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:10,208
我不想因为待得太久而招人讨厌，你呢？
Don't want to outstay a welcome, do you?

580
00:36:10,292 --> 00:36:13,583
你在聚会上还挺受欢迎，你应该多出来参加这种聚会
You got a pretty big one there. You should get out more.

581
00:36:13,667 --> 00:36:17,458
他们并不介意我进去，是吧？
Well, then they wouldn't care when I walked in, would they?

582
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,000
那个姑娘欺负过你？
Did that girl hurt you?

583
00:36:19,125 --> 00:36:20,583
别的方式欺负的我
Other way round.

584
00:36:20,667 --> 00:36:22,333
她一拳打到我下巴上了，可疼了
I caught her fist a good one with my chin,

585
00:36:22,417 --> 00:36:25,667
然后我就用鼻子挡她的膝盖
then whacked her right in the knee with my nose.

586
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:27,917
你还真得小心点
You need to be careful.

587
00:36:28,042 --> 00:36:29,333
用不着
No, I don't.

588
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,958
就是这么回事
That's the thing.

589
00:36:34,042 --> 00:36:35,250
你到家了
Here you go then.

590
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:36,625
你这是什么意思？
How do you mean?

591
00:36:37,167 --> 00:36:38,708
你到家了。不，瞎说，不行
This is you. No, bollocks, no way.

592
00:36:38,792 --> 00:36:39,958
我送你到家门口
I'll walk you to your door.

593
00:36:40,042 --> 00:36:41,417
不用了吧？-当然用，没事
Are you sure? -Yeah, of course, no trouble.

594
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:45,208
看
See?

595
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:49,792
谢谢你
Thank you.

596
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:49,375
嘿
Hey.

597
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:52,333
你好
Hello.

598
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:54,625
你掉了五块钱
You dropped a fiver.

599
00:37:54,708 --> 00:37:55,708
什么？
What?

600
00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:58,125
五块钱，你掉的
That fiver. You dropped it.

601
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:00,625
那不是我的
That's not mine.

602
00:38:00,708 --> 00:38:02,167
我看见它从你兜里掉出来的
I saw it come out of your pocket.

603
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:05,292
真得吗？-可不
Really? - Yeah.

604
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,042
因为我当时正往那看呢
'Cause I was looking.

605
00:38:11,958 --> 00:38:14,250
好吧，谢谢
Okay, well, thanks.

606
00:38:24,583 --> 00:38:26,208
太牛逼了！绝对的
That was so cool. It totally was.

607
00:38:26,292 --> 00:38:28,750
我们像真正的窃贼一样牛逼！你那双勾人的眼睛太厉害了
We rock as criminals. That flirty eye thing you were doing.

608
00:38:28,833 --> 00:38:31,417
你拿卡的时间也恰到好处
What about you nipping in there with the perfect timing?

609
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,542
那咱们现在干吗？
So now what?

610
00:38:32,583 --> 00:38:34,042
现在咱们去取点钱然后去个聚会
Now we get some cash out and party.

611
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:35,458
用这卡取？-是的
With the card? -Right.

612
00:38:35,542 --> 00:38:36,750
好吧，密码是什么？
Okay. What's the number?

613
00:38:36,875 --> 00:38:38,125
你什么意思？
What do you mean?

614
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:40,500
你没看见密码吗？
Didn't you see the number?

615
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:42,125
没有哇，我当时正忙着用眼睛电他呢
No, I was doing the flirty eye thing.

616
00:38:42,208 --> 00:38:43,417
我只管拿卡
I was nipping in there.

617
00:38:43,958 --> 00:38:45,458
咱俩这盗贼当的太屎了
We suck as criminals.

618
00:38:46,167 --> 00:38:48,583
也许这样最好。那哥们看上去没事
Probably best.The guy seemed all right.

619
00:38:48,667 --> 00:38:49,958
要不咱俩试试再把卡还给他
Maybe we should try and give his card back.

620
00:38:50,042 --> 00:38:51,042
怎么还？
And how are we going to do that?

621
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:52,667
希望我没打断你们，回来！
Not interrupting anything,am I? Get...

622
00:39:15,542 --> 00:39:17,333
泰萨……干吗？
Tessa...What?

623
00:39:17,417 --> 00:39:19,083
那张卡。-卡怎么？
The card. -What about it?

624
00:39:19,167 --> 00:39:20,750
还给他
Give it back to him!

625
00:39:31,583 --> 00:39:33,958
斯科特老耍酷，我知道他对我着迷了
Scott plays it cool.I know he's crazy about me.

626
00:39:34,042 --> 00:39:35,375
你怎么知道？
How'd you know?

627
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,833
因为他是男的
Because he's a guy.

628
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:38,292
我信你
I'll take your word for it.

629
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:40,125
那你说他昨天晚上干吗不给我打电话？
So, why didn't he call me last night?

630
00:39:40,208 --> 00:39:41,792
小邹，有个事我想跟你说
Zo, there's something I need to tell you.

631
00:39:41,917 --> 00:39:43,458
咱先把这一票干完
Let's get this done first.

632
00:39:43,542 --> 00:39:45,458
记住，在商店里偷东西靠得全是自信
Remember, shoplifting's all about confidence.

633
00:39:45,542 --> 00:39:47,875
抬头挺胸，拿起来放进包里
Walk tall, pick and pocket.

634
00:39:47,958 --> 00:39:50,375
进去之后咱俩分开行动
In there, we go in separate.

635
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:51,875
为什么不能在一起？
Why not together?

636
00:39:51,958 --> 00:39:53,167
在一块更可以，走吧
More suspicious. Go on.

637
00:39:55,917 --> 00:39:57,458
好吧
Right.

638
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:33,625
泰萨？泰萨·斯科特？
Tessa? Tessa Scott?

639
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:35,333
不，不是我
No. Sorry.

640
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:36,875
就是你
It is you.

641
00:40:37,042 --> 00:40:39,625
你还记得我们俩吗？高中的时候
Don't you remember us? From school.

642
00:40:42,292 --> 00:40:43,458
哦，是啊
Oh, yeah.

643
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,167
你11岁的时候转学了，是吧？
You left in Year 11,didn't you?

644
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:46,833
十岁
Ten.

645
00:40:48,042 --> 00:40:52,208
你现在怎么样了？还在进行化疗吗？
So how's it going? Are you still having all that treatment?

646
00:40:54,125 --> 00:40:55,292
不治了
Not anymore.

647
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:56,667
这么说你好点了？
So you're better?

648
00:40:57,208 --> 00:40:58,250
没有
No.

649
00:41:02,417 --> 00:41:03,750
你们想干吗呀？
What do you two want?

650
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,958
嘿，邹逸，你帮她购物吗？
Hi, Zoey. You helping her shop?

651
00:41:07,917 --> 00:41:09,292
走吧？-好
Are you ready to go? -Yeah.

652
00:41:09,375 --> 00:41:11,208
你跟斯科特·雷蒙德约会，是真的吗？
Is it true you've been seeing Scott Redmond?

653
00:41:14,625 --> 00:41:16,250
关你屁事？- 你认识他吗？
What's it to you? -Do you know him?

654
00:41:16,333 --> 00:41:17,333
行了，走吧
All right, let's go.

655
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:18,458
大家都认识他
Everybody knows him.

656
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:21,417
半小时前他跟我姐姐出去了
He went out with my sister for about half an hour.

657
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,792
是么？
Is that right?

658
00:41:24,167 --> 00:41:26,125
我还得去选我葬礼的邀请卡呢
I have to go collect the invites for my funeral.

659
00:41:26,583 --> 00:41:28,208
真的？-是啊
Really? -Yeah.

660
00:41:28,292 --> 00:41:29,500
我还得去整理我的悼词
I also need to sort out the readings.

661
00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:31,958
确保那不是一首破诗，这些都得在我死前弄完
Make sure it's not that bloody poem. It's been done to death.

662
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,333
放开我
Let go of me.

663
00:41:33,417 --> 00:41:35,875
她们都是傻逼，小邹，她们什么都不知道
They're idiots, Zo. They don't know anything.

664
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:37,250
我知道
I know.

665
00:41:38,167 --> 00:41:39,208
我得去找他去
I have to go find him.

666
00:41:39,792 --> 00:41:40,875
现在？
NOW?

667
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:43,708
是啊，对不起，我得走了
Yeah. I'm sorry. I need to go.

668
00:41:48,208 --> 00:41:49,458
嘿！
Hey!

669
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:08,958
还有一个，把她也抓住！
Another one! Stop her too!

670
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,375
抓住了
Gotcha.

671
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,917
坐下
Sit down.

672
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:27,500
把兜里东西都掏出来 
Empty your pockets.

673
00:42:34,083 --> 00:42:37,083
好了，我管这些叫证据，你知道么？
Well, I'd call that evidence, wouldn't you?

674
00:42:37,917 --> 00:42:40,417
姓名，住址，父母的电话
Name. Address. Parents' phone numbers.

675
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:42,167
别给我爸打电话
Don't call my dad.

676
00:42:42,292 --> 00:42:43,667
我们有两个选择
We have a choice.

677
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:46,458
要不然给你爸打电话，要不然就报警
We can call him, or we can call the police.

678
00:42:46,583 --> 00:42:48,958
报警吧，每次都是报警
The police, every time.

679
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:52,792
我跟门外那个人说我能处理这个，不过如果你……
Now, I told that guy out there I'd handle it, and if you...

680
00:42:52,875 --> 00:42:54,208
听着……
Listen...

681
00:43:00,417 --> 00:43:02,083
这是一个植入式经脉输液口
This is a portacath.

682
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:06,500
化疗透析用的
It's an access disk for medical treatments.

683
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,333
我得了急性淋巴细胞白血病
I have acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

684
00:43:09,875 --> 00:43:11,708
请你把衣服穿好
Please put your shirt back on.

685
00:43:12,167 --> 00:43:14,417
你知道什么叫急性淋巴细胞白血病吗？
Do you know what acute lymphoblastic leukemia is?

686
00:43:14,583 --> 00:43:16,292
不，恐怕我不知道
No, I'm afraid I don't.

687
00:43:16,667 --> 00:43:17,833
就是癌症
It's cancer.

688
00:43:25,375 --> 00:43:27,708
那我还是得给你爸打电话
I still have to call your dad.

689
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,667
还有你，你什么借口啊？
And you, what's your excuse?

690
00:43:33,625 --> 00:43:35,375
她都偷什么了？
What did she take?

691
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:38,708
蓝条家庭验孕棒
One Clearblue Home Pregnancy Test.

692
00:43:54,333 --> 00:43:57,708
这也在你的列表上吗？在商店偷东西？
Was this on the list? Shoplifting?

693
00:44:04,625 --> 00:44:06,375
你这是干吗呀？泰萨？
What are you doing, Tessa?

694
00:44:06,583 --> 00:44:07,583
你这是干吗？
What are you doing?

695
00:44:07,667 --> 00:44:09,000
尽我所能，尽快实现我这些愿望
As much as I can.As fast as I can.

696
00:44:09,917 --> 00:44:11,417
我希望你停下来
I wish you'd stop.

697
00:44:11,792 --> 00:44:13,250
你愿意让我下半辈子
You'd prefer I spend the rest of my life

698
00:44:13,292 --> 00:44:14,708
裹着毯子蜷在沙发里
huddled in a blanket on the sofa,

699
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:16,250
头垂在你的肩膀上吗
with my head on your shoulder.

700
00:44:18,083 --> 00:44:20,125
是，我愿意，你要责怪我吗？
Yeah, I would.Can you blame me?

701
00:44:22,458 --> 00:44:23,958
是的，我愿意
Yes, I would.

702
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:32,042
我的意思是，我的意思是我喜欢强壮的女人
My point is... Well, my point is, I like a strong woman.

703
00:44:32,125 --> 00:44:33,417
你一直喜欢被抱上床的感觉吧
You've always wanted to be carried to bed.

704
00:44:33,583 --> 00:44:35,542
我一直就想被人抱上床
I have always wanted to be carried to bed.

705
00:44:35,625 --> 00:44:37,792
我不喜欢什么呢，把一个
What I don't do, is bring to a mate's party

706
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:40,875
公认的，完美的，显形的，年轻精灵术士带到哥们的聚会上去
an, admittedly perfectly formed, young pixie warlock.

707
00:44:41,125 --> 00:44:42,375
她可不是什么术士
Yeah, she's isn't a warlock.

708
00:44:42,458 --> 00:44:43,667
我意思是，你不能到处去
I mean you can't just go around

709
00:44:43,708 --> 00:44:45,208
找人打架
starting fights every which way

710
00:44:45,292 --> 00:44:46,583
而且到处砸东西吧（手机：往右看）
and shaking things up like that.

711
00:44:51,625 --> 00:44:53,458
显然你可以那么干
Apparently you can.

712
00:45:04,917 --> 00:45:06,375
你到这来干吗？
What are you doing here?

713
00:45:07,167 --> 00:45:08,833
我都跟踪你一整天了
I've been stalking you all day.

714
00:45:09,042 --> 00:45:11,917
我才刚刚鼓起勇气现身的
I only just now plucked up the courage to reveal myself.

715
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,083
是吗？
Really?

716
00:45:13,875 --> 00:45:15,000
不是
No.

717
00:45:17,708 --> 00:45:20,208
我爸在绿色食品店买东西呢，他可能会开车经过这儿
My dad's in the health food store.He could drive past.

718
00:45:24,042 --> 00:45:25,375
能在见到你的朋友们真好
It's nice to see your mates again.

719
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:30,708
是啊，永远那么兴奋
Yeah. Always a pleasure.

720
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,708
好了，怎么回头见吧
Well, I'll see you around, maybe.

721
00:45:41,833 --> 00:45:43,250
好的
Sure, yeah.

722
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:50,000
我知道你还看着我呢
I know you're looking.

723
00:45:50,792 --> 00:45:52,083
我没看
I'm not looking.

724
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,292
瞎说
Liar.

725
00:46:02,208 --> 00:46:04,917
也许你该考虑一下回去上学
Perhaps you should think about going back to school.

726
00:46:05,042 --> 00:46:07,083
把你的生活搞得正常一点
A bit of normality in your life.

727
00:46:07,167 --> 00:46:09,333
我不想回去上学
I'm not going back to school.

728
00:46:09,417 --> 00:46:11,708
癌症晚期应该振作一些
There's got to be some perks to terminal illness.

729
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:16,792
我烦死你了吧？
I'm killing you, right?

730
00:46:18,083 --> 00:46:19,333
每天都是
Every day.

731
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:24,625
看着点，哥们
Watch out, mate.

732
00:46:25,542 --> 00:46:27,125
臭傻逼
Bloody idiot.

733
00:46:29,708 --> 00:46:31,375
这家伙要干吗？
What's this guy up to?

734
00:46:46,167 --> 00:46:48,792
泰萨，你干吗去啊？泰萨？
Tessa, where are you going? Tessa?

735
00:46:52,417 --> 00:46:54,083
泰萨！
Tessa!

736
00:47:34,667 --> 00:47:36,208
骑摩托车的感觉
That was good.

737
00:47:36,708 --> 00:47:38,625
真不错
A ride on a motorbike.

738
00:47:39,208 --> 00:47:41,167
这事应该在我的癌症清单上
Should have been on my list.

739
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:43,042
都什么呀？说一个听听
What is? Name one.

740
00:47:44,208 --> 00:47:45,375
出名
Fame.

741
00:47:47,458 --> 00:47:48,917
你要多出名啊？
How famous do you want to be?

742
00:47:50,417 --> 00:47:54,125
名气大到能让全世界的人都停下手里的事
Enough for the whole world to stop what it's doing

743
00:47:54,208 --> 00:47:56,583
在我死前排着队来跟我道别
and personally come and say goodbye to me when I die.

744
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,458
我觉得这挺好，你的要求还不是太过分
I think it's good you're not asking too much there.

745
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:04,625
我只想让自己名扬在外，你知道么
I just want to have my name out there somewhere, you know.

746
00:48:07,042 --> 00:48:08,792
你不用担心，人们不会忘了你的，泰丝
You don't have to worry about being forgotten, Tess.

747
00:48:13,083 --> 00:48:14,292
还有呢？
Anything else?

748
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:23,042
还有
Yeah.

749
00:48:26,542 --> 00:48:28,333
你干吗呀？
What are you doing?

750
00:48:28,792 --> 00:48:30,083
我正在想另外一个
I just thought of another.

751
00:48:32,167 --> 00:48:33,708
你不会是要裸泳吧
You're not gonna swim naked.

752
00:48:33,875 --> 00:48:36,417
不是，你以为我疯了吗？
No way. You think I'm crazy?

753
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,583
不是全脱
Not naked.

754
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:42,167
泰丝！泰丝！
Tess! Tess!

755
00:48:55,375 --> 00:48:56,750
好吧，数到三，行吗？
Okay, count of three, yeah?

756
00:48:57,292 --> 00:48:58,292
什么？
What?

757
00:48:58,375 --> 00:49:01,583
咱们必须得跑进去，全都没到水里才行
Just got to commit. We just run in, full whack.

758
00:49:02,458 --> 00:49:04,000
就这么定了，来吧
Deal. Right.

759
00:49:04,792 --> 00:49:06,708
妈的来呀
Bollocks. - Here we go.

760
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:09,583
一，二，三！
One, two, three!

761
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,792
你这个坏人！你太缺德了！
You're evil! You are so evil!

762
00:49:24,292 --> 00:49:25,667
感觉怎么样？
How is it?

763
00:49:25,917 --> 00:49:27,875
特别好，实际上水里又暖和又舒服
Yeah, actually really gorgeous and lovely.

764
00:49:28,042 --> 00:49:29,042
真的？
Really?

765
00:49:29,125 --> 00:49:31,458
不是。不过你也下来吧
No. But go for it anyway.

766
00:49:32,167 --> 00:49:33,167
来呀，怕什么？
Come on, what are you scared of?

767
00:49:33,917 --> 00:49:35,000
没什么
Nothing.

768
00:49:53,875 --> 00:49:55,583
好吧，好吧
Okay, okay.

769
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:04,500
看，往好的方向说
See, the great thing is,

770
00:50:04,542 --> 00:50:06,000
我总是在想
I have actually always wondered

771
00:50:06,083 --> 00:50:08,667
怎么才能穿着袜子把它晾干
if it was possible to dry yourself with a sock.

772
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:12,542
谢谢你陪我
Thanks for doing that with me.

773
00:50:13,625 --> 00:50:15,208
我可不想错过这种事
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

774
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,500
星星出来了
The stars are out.

775
00:50:24,375 --> 00:50:25,542
是啊
Yeah.

776
00:50:26,042 --> 00:50:27,583
你看见上面那五颗星了吗？
See that group of five up there?

777
00:50:27,667 --> 00:50:28,792
排成弧形的那些
The kind of curved shape.

778
00:50:28,875 --> 00:50:30,333
看见了吗？看见了吗？
See them? See them?

779
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:31,375
看见了
Yeah.

780
00:50:32,458 --> 00:50:33,958
我根本不知道它叫什么
I've got no idea what they're called.

781
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:46,542
笨蛋
Goon.

782
00:50:49,417 --> 00:50:50,500
不
No.

783
00:50:54,042 --> 00:50:55,292
什么？
What?

784
00:50:57,292 --> 00:50:58,667
对不起
I'm sorry.

785
00:50:59,792 --> 00:51:01,542
你不喜欢我？
Don't you like me?

786
00:51:03,792 --> 00:51:05,375
不是因为那个
It's not that.

787
00:51:08,708 --> 00:51:10,125
我觉得我承受不起
I don't think I can handle it.

788
00:51:13,583 --> 00:51:14,667
回见
I'll see you around.

789
00:51:14,958 --> 00:51:16,875
泰丝……泰丝，等等
Tess... Tess, wait. Come on.

790
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:18,292
泰丝，别这样
Tessa, come on.

791
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:19,458
不，我犯了个错误
No, I've made a mistake.

792
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:23,792
什么？什么错误？
What? What mistake?

793
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,750
你救不了我
You can't save me.

794
00:52:29,375 --> 00:52:31,250
在你小时候
When you were a baby,

795
00:52:32,125 --> 00:52:35,208
我跟你妈躺在你旁边看着你喘气
me and your mum used to lie awake at night watching you breathe.

796
00:52:39,125 --> 00:52:41,333
我们当时都很担心如果我们不看着你
We were convinced that if we stopped looking,

797
00:52:41,417 --> 00:52:43,542
你就会忘了怎么呼吸
you'd forget how to do it.

798
00:52:47,417 --> 00:52:49,875
等你的孩子长大之后，那就是另外一种担心
As your kids get older, it's a different kind of worry.

799
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:54,083
我们永远都在担心
It never ever goes.

800
00:52:56,875 --> 00:52:58,917
你想想吧
Please think about that.

801
00:53:03,042 --> 00:53:06,500
你知道么，我更喜欢你跟我胡扯
You know, I kind of prefer it when you give me shit.

802
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,625
泰萨？
Tessa?

803
00:53:20,542 --> 00:53:21,792
泰萨？
Tessa?

804
00:53:38,792 --> 00:53:39,958
护士！
Nurse!

805
00:53:40,042 --> 00:53:41,625
拿着，亲爱的
Here, darling.

806
00:53:45,333 --> 00:53:47,000
好的，好的
Okay, okay.

807
00:53:47,083 --> 00:53:49,292
我们很快把这打扫干净
We'll soon have that cleared up.

808
00:53:49,375 --> 00:53:52,917
对不起，对不起
I'm sorry. Sorry.

809
00:53:53,167 --> 00:53:54,458
没事，亲爱的
It's okay, darling.

810
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:58,375
你好，泰萨，感觉怎么样？
Hello, Tessa. How are you?

811
00:53:58,542 --> 00:53:59,708
还行
Good.

812
00:54:00,208 --> 00:54:02,375
我觉得我对自己的估价太高了
I think dignity's overrated anyway.*

813
00:54:04,833 --> 00:54:07,458
我们昨晚做了一些化验
We performed some tests last night.

814
00:54:07,708 --> 00:54:10,833
恐怕癌细胞已经蔓延到你的脊髓了
I'm afraid the cancer has spread to your spinal fluid.

815
00:54:10,917 --> 00:54:13,208
扩散的速度比我们预想的要快
Things are progressing more quickly than we first thought.

816
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:15,208
你的病情急转直下
You've moved further down the line.

817
00:54:17,375 --> 00:54:18,792
有多急？
How much further?

818
00:54:22,042 --> 00:54:24,625
我想说的是，想干点什么就去干吧
I would encourage you to do the things you want to do.

819
00:54:29,667 --> 00:54:31,083
我尽力吧
I'm trying.

820
00:54:34,958 --> 00:54:36,667
多迷人的花园啊！
Enchanted Garden!

821
00:54:40,458 --> 00:54:42,083
喔！
Whoo!

822
00:54:43,875 --> 00:54:45,250
真好看
That was lovely.

823
00:54:45,458 --> 00:54:47,250
没劲，在放个别的
Boring. Do another.

824
00:54:47,792 --> 00:54:49,417
你想放什么？要不放个火箭？
What do you want to do? Should I do a rocket?

825
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:50,667
好哇！放个火箭！
Yes! Do a rocket!

826
00:54:50,875 --> 00:54:51,875
好
Okay.

827
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,458
再跟我说一遍你干吗来了
Remind me again why you're here.

828
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:59,542
你爸爸说我要是再不露个脸就把我腿砍下来
Your father said he'd chop my legs off if I didn't show up.

829
00:54:59,625 --> 00:55:00,833
大家准备好了吗？
Ready, everybody?

830
00:55:00,875 --> 00:55:02,500
捂住耳朵，这个特别响
Cover your ears, this is gonna be aloud one.

831
00:55:03,958 --> 00:55:04,958
哦！
Oh!

832
00:55:10,167 --> 00:55:11,500
好吧
Okay.

833
00:55:12,667 --> 00:55:14,000
好吗？
Okay?

834
00:55:14,458 --> 00:55:15,708
好
Okay.

835
00:55:19,583 --> 00:55:21,250
不错，你那还有什么呀？
Not bad. What else you got in there?

836
00:55:21,333 --> 00:55:23,458
要不我再放个二十一响小瀑布？
Should I go for a 21-shot Cascade?

837
00:55:23,542 --> 00:55:26,000
好哇！放小瀑布！我数着
Yes, do the Cascade! I'll count.

838
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:29,083
准备好了吗？好，走你
Ready? Right, here we go.

839
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,792
一，二，三
One, two, three...

840
00:55:35,875 --> 00:55:37,583
三……
Three...

841
00:55:38,958 --> 00:55:42,583
四……四，五……
- Four...- Four, five...

842
00:55:44,792 --> 00:55:50,708
六，七，八，九，十
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

843
00:56:33,375 --> 00:56:34,583
泰萨……
Tessa...

844
00:56:36,375 --> 00:56:38,125
最坏的情况是什么？
What's the worst that can happen?

845
00:56:40,083 --> 00:56:41,500
会很疼
It'll hurt.

846
00:56:43,125 --> 00:56:44,583
已经挺疼的了
It already hurts.

847
00:57:02,542 --> 00:57:05,417
邹逸说的对。这能让我活下去
Zoey was right. I'm alive.

848
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:10,208
我还活着
I'm alive.

849
00:57:32,708 --> 00:57:34,958
早晨好，爸爸，睡得好吗？
Morning, Dad. Sleep well?

850
00:57:35,917 --> 00:57:38,000
你是谁？你跟我对我女儿干吗了？
Who are you? What have you done with my daughter?

851
00:57:38,167 --> 00:57:39,458
坐下
Sit.

852
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:42,750
吃，喝咖啡
Eat. Drink coffee.

853
00:57:57,208 --> 00:57:58,417
爸爸，我想给你介绍一下
Dad, I want to introduce someone.

854
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:00,083
哦，天呐
Oh, God.

855
00:58:00,167 --> 00:58:02,000
这是亚当，亚当，这是我爸爸
This is Adam. Adam, Dad.

856
00:58:02,083 --> 00:58:03,583
见到您很高兴，先生
It's good to meet you, sir.

857
00:58:03,708 --> 00:58:05,208
你不用管他叫先生
You don't have to call him sir.

858
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:07,083
叫先生挺好的
Sir will be fine.

859
00:58:07,875 --> 00:58:09,375
很好，谁要烤面包？
Excellent. Who wants toast?

860
00:58:09,667 --> 00:58:11,125
你可以走了
You can go.

861
00:58:11,417 --> 00:58:12,708
那不就错过好玩的了么？
And miss all the fun?

862
00:58:13,042 --> 00:58:14,333
没事，你走吧，泰丝
It's all right, Tess.

863
00:58:22,042 --> 00:58:24,000
坐下。-好
Sit down. -Yeah.

864
00:58:32,458 --> 00:58:33,833
作为一个父亲，当女儿带回来一个男孩
It's a terrible day in an man's life

865
00:58:33,875 --> 00:58:36,125
将是很糟糕的一天
when his daughter brings a boy home.

866
00:58:37,292 --> 00:58:40,542
我老觉得要是我把第一个给宰了，其他人知道了就不敢再来了
I always thought if I killed the first one, word would get around.

867
00:58:44,333 --> 00:58:45,333
你上大学了吗？
Do you go to college?

868
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:46,417
上了一阵子
Yeah, I had a place.

869
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:48,042
后来家里出了点儿事儿，你知道
Then some stuff happened, you know.

870
00:58:49,042 --> 00:58:51,750
我知道出什么事了，对你的不幸我感到很遗憾
I know what happened. I'm sorry for your loss.

871
00:58:51,833 --> 00:58:53,250
是啊
Yeah.

872
00:58:53,542 --> 00:58:54,792
你妈妈怎么样了？
How is your mum doing?

873
00:58:54,875 --> 00:58:56,583
有时候还行。-是吧
Some days she seems okay. -Yeah.

874
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:00,042
我曾经想过泰萨
I used to think that about Tessa.

875
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:01,375
你知道她的情况吧？
You're aware of her condition?

876
00:59:01,458 --> 00:59:03,042
知道，她什么都跟我说了
Yeah, she's told me everything.

877
00:59:03,667 --> 00:59:05,292
不，她没有
No, she hasn't.

878
00:59:06,333 --> 00:59:07,708
如果她想让你看到她的迷人之处
If she wants you to find her attractive,

879
00:59:07,792 --> 00:59:11,625
她就不会把所有的事都告诉你
then one thing she won't have done is told you everything.

880
00:59:13,042 --> 00:59:14,042
你多大了？
How old are you?

881
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:15,750
问这干吗？
Why?

882
00:59:16,958 --> 00:59:18,875
因为以你这个岁数，不用非得去照顾别人
Because at your age, you shouldn't have to be nursing someone.

883
00:59:19,333 --> 00:59:20,375
泰萨不需要照顾
Tessa doesn't need nursing.

884
00:59:20,417 --> 00:59:21,875
不，她需要
Yes, she does.

885
00:59:22,583 --> 00:59:24,750
她的情况会越来越糟
And she will more and more.

886
00:59:25,333 --> 00:59:29,208
而你，我的小朋友，你承担不了那么繁重的工作
And you, my young friend, you're simply not up to the task.

887
00:59:29,958 --> 00:59:31,292
那，你为什么不帮我们个忙呢
So, why don't you do us all a favor,

888
00:59:31,375 --> 00:59:32,792
趁她还活着的时候赶紧滚蛋
and piss off out of what's left of her life.

889
00:59:52,792 --> 00:59:54,500
你是怎么从你爸那把车借出来的？
So, how'd you get your dad to lend you the car?

890
00:59:54,875 --> 00:59:57,625
我还以为你再也不理他了呢
I thought you weren't speaking to him.

891
00:59:58,167 --> 01:00:01,083
我还有一个理由没用呢
I knew there was a reason I forgot to ask.

892
01:00:03,625 --> 01:00:05,917
好吧，谢谢你带我来
Well, thanks for bringing me.

893
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:07,917
我还以为会有好多女孩
I thought it would be full of girls

894
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,500
拿着纸巾准备受伤呢
holding tissues and looking gutted.

895
01:00:11,125 --> 01:00:13,583
至少斯科特私下里给了我钱
At least Scott paid for privacy.

896
01:00:15,583 --> 01:00:17,333
他会度过这一关的
He'll get over it.

897
01:00:18,083 --> 01:00:20,000
不，不会的
No, never.

898
01:00:21,208 --> 01:00:22,583
他永远都过不去了，他恨我
He never will. He hates me.

899
01:00:26,042 --> 01:00:27,292
你恨我吗？
Do you?

900
01:00:30,833 --> 01:00:32,250
我今天跟他们谈了
I'm just talking to them today.

901
01:00:32,708 --> 01:00:33,792
关于下一次约会？
About making another appointment?

902
01:00:34,958 --> 01:00:39,250
是啊，我不想要，行吗？
Yes. Yeah, I want it gone, all right?

903
01:00:40,208 --> 01:00:42,917
邹逸·沃克？我们准备好了
Zoey Walker? We're ready for you now.

904
01:00:43,958 --> 01:00:45,250
我不想要
I just want it gone.

905
01:00:57,375 --> 01:00:59,333
你撞到围栏了
You hit that curb.

906
01:00:59,417 --> 01:01:01,792
又不是我的错。这条路应该是直的
Wasn't my fault. The road should have been straight.

907
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:06,458
你到了
There you go.

908
01:01:08,167 --> 01:01:09,917
泰丝，你知道我没得选的
Tess, you know I've got no choice.

909
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,667
你都不知道你自己在说什么
You don't even know what those words mean.

910
01:01:17,792 --> 01:01:20,083
既然你这么反对干吗还要陪我去？
Why did you come if you were just going to disapprove?

911
01:01:20,667 --> 01:01:22,208
因为你需要我陪你
'Cause that's why you asked me.

912
01:01:46,958 --> 01:01:48,042
嘿
Hey.

913
01:01:50,042 --> 01:01:53,167
你好。这是我第一次开车
Evening. That was my first drive.

914
01:01:53,542 --> 01:01:54,708
第一次开？
First ever?

915
01:01:56,042 --> 01:01:57,417
你可真是想起一出是一出啊
Well, then you did fantastic.

916
01:01:57,542 --> 01:01:58,958
你觉得如何？
You think?

917
01:01:59,208 --> 01:02:02,792
是啊，挺好，就是换挡的时候声音太大了
Yeah. Yeah, that's just how changing gear is meant to sound.

918
01:02:02,875 --> 01:02:05,250
这是我爸爸的车，它活该这样
It's my dad's car.Deserves what it gets.

919
01:02:05,917 --> 01:02:08,000
他只是想尽量保护你的安全
He's just trying to keep you safe.

920
01:02:08,083 --> 01:02:10,333
我觉得根本用不着，你说呢？
I think that ship has sailed, don't you?

921
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:19,250
你想跟我约会吗？
Would you like to go on a date with me?

922
01:02:19,292 --> 01:02:20,500
我只是觉得我们从来没约会过
Just it occurred to me we've never

923
01:02:20,583 --> 01:02:22,208
应该正式约一次
actually been on a date,like a proper one,

924
01:02:22,292 --> 01:02:24,583
而且我觉得咱们应该试试
and I thought that maybe we should.

925
01:02:24,625 --> 01:02:26,250
知道么，其实用不着非得在今天晚上，比如现在，
You know, it doesn't have to be right tonight, like now,

926
01:02:26,333 --> 01:02:27,958
但是，你知道，这个邀请随时都有效
but, you know, the offer's there, for anytime.

927
01:02:28,042 --> 01:02:29,917
你只要告诉我什么时间合适就行了
You just let me know when suits.

928
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:35,292
现在就行
Now is good.

929
01:02:45,292 --> 01:02:47,667
天呐，泰萨，你之前应该来个电话
Christ, Tessa. You could have called.

930
01:02:48,292 --> 01:02:49,458
你在这干吗？
What are you doing here?

931
01:02:49,542 --> 01:02:51,417
你爸和卡尔到处找你，你到哪去了？
Dad and Cal are looking for you. Where have you been?

932
01:02:52,167 --> 01:02:54,083
咱们改天再聊吧
We'll have to talk about it some other time.

933
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,125
为什么？
Why?

934
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,917
因为我得去赴一个约会
'Cause I've got a date.

935
01:03:04,333 --> 01:03:05,625
对，她回来了
Yeah. She's here.

936
01:03:24,958 --> 01:03:27,458
今晚不行，今晚可不能犯病
Not tonight. Please, not tonight.

937
01:03:27,542 --> 01:03:30,583
行了，我跟你爸说了，我告诉他不用担心，他……
Okay, I've called your father. I've told him not to worry. He's going...

938
01:03:31,792 --> 01:03:33,750
我的天呐！-只是流鼻血而已
Oh, my God. -It's just a nosebleed.

939
01:03:34,208 --> 01:03:36,625
不是吧，你的血都快流干了，泰萨，我……
No, it's pumping out of you. Tessa, I...

940
01:03:37,083 --> 01:03:39,000
我该怎么办？-我不知道……
What should I do? -I don't know...

941
01:03:39,083 --> 01:03:40,833
给，拿这毛巾
Here, take a towel.

942
01:03:41,333 --> 01:03:44,000
坐下，捏捏鼻子什么的
Sit down. Pinch your nose or something.

943
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:48,458
哦，你得去医院
Oh, you need to go to hospital.

944
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:50,750
一会血就不流了。我得给你爸打电话
It'll stop in a minute. I'm calling your father.

945
01:03:50,833 --> 01:03:53,083
我该给你爸打电话吗？我该怎么办啊
Should I call your father? I don't know what to do.

946
01:03:53,167 --> 01:03:54,917
告诉我该干什么！ -给我拿点冰块来
Tell me what to do! -Just get me some ice.

947
01:03:55,375 --> 01:03:57,000
什么？ -冰块！
What? -Ice!

948
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:59,417
最好是一带冻豌豆
A bag of frozen peas would be best.

949
01:04:00,583 --> 01:04:02,458
对，冻豌豆
Right. Frozen peas.

950
01:04:10,042 --> 01:04:13,250
这有甜玉米，甜玉米行吗？
There's sweet corn. Is sweet corn okay?

951
01:04:14,292 --> 01:04:15,417
哦，天呐
Oh, Jesus.

952
01:04:15,583 --> 01:04:16,958
你还是带我去医院吧
You have to take me to hospital.

953
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,833
我不行，泰萨，我觉得应该让你爸带你去
I can't, Tessa. I think your father should do this.

954
01:04:19,917 --> 01:04:20,958
来不及了
There isn't time.

955
01:04:21,042 --> 01:04:22,042
好吧
Okay.

956
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:24,583
是的，叫辆救护车，谢谢，快点，快点！
Yes. Ambulance, please. Quickly. Quickly!

957
01:04:27,542 --> 01:04:28,917
那是谁？-不
Who is it? -No.

958
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,500
那是谁？-他不能……
Who is it? -He can't...

959
01:04:30,583 --> 01:04:32,083
我需要帮助。-别让他进来
I need help. -Don't let him in.

960
01:04:32,125 --> 01:04:33,167
不行，我需要帮手
No, I need help.

961
01:04:33,208 --> 01:04:34,375
他不能看见我这样
He can't see me like this!

962
01:04:34,417 --> 01:04:37,125
泰丝，我自己干不了，我需要帮手
Tess, I can't do this on my own. I need help.

963
01:04:58,583 --> 01:04:59,625
进来
Coming.

964
01:04:59,708 --> 01:05:01,917
帮我把她抬到楼下去
Help me get her downstairs.

965
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:06,875
快点，你帮不帮忙？
Come on. Are you gonna help?

966
01:05:07,042 --> 01:05:08,667
让他出去，求你了
Get him out! Please.

967
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:10,750
好吧，你走吧，我们能处理，走
All right, just go.We can manage. Go.

968
01:05:18,917 --> 01:05:20,167
给你拿着这个好吗？
Would you hold that?

969
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:22,750
谢谢你
Thank you.

970
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,125
亚当
Adam.

971
01:05:32,792 --> 01:05:34,792
她肯定会很渴，她流了好多血
She must be thirsty. She's lost so much blood.

972
01:05:34,875 --> 01:05:36,417
要不要给她喝点水？用不用？
Should she have some water? Should she?

973
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,667
还是让医生来看看吧，好吗？
Let's see what the doctor says, all right.

974
01:05:40,125 --> 01:05:41,917
很好，到这来
Good. Here you are.

975
01:05:44,292 --> 01:05:47,667
好，以前有没有血小板减少的症状？
Right. Any signs of thrombocytopenia before today?

976
01:05:48,625 --> 01:05:50,542
孩儿她妈？孩儿她妈？
Mum? Mum?

977
01:05:50,667 --> 01:05:52,583
抱歉，问我呐？
Sorry, me?

978
01:05:52,625 --> 01:05:54,208
她有没有抱怨过头疼？
Has she complained of a headache?

979
01:05:54,292 --> 01:05:56,083
你有没有注意到什么她注射过毒品？
Have you noticed any pinprick bruising?

980
01:05:56,167 --> 01:05:57,625
说实话，我没注意
I didn't look, to be honest.

981
01:05:57,708 --> 01:05:59,792
她最后一次输血是什么时候？
When was the last platelet transfusion?

982
01:05:59,875 --> 01:06:01,958
我不知道，我可以找人问问
I'm not sure. I can try...I can try and find out.

983
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:04,750
她最近有没有用过什么阿司匹林之类的药？
Has she used any aspirin products recently?

984
01:06:04,833 --> 01:06:06,083
我不知道，我不知道
I don't know. I don't...

985
01:06:06,167 --> 01:06:08,417
对不起，这些问题我一个都答不上来
I'm sorry. I don't know the answers to any of these questions.

986
01:06:08,458 --> 01:06:11,000
我最后一次血小板输血是五月十八号
My last platelet transfusion was May 18th.

987
01:06:11,083 --> 01:06:13,208
好的，谢谢你，别说话了
Okay, thank you. Don't talk.

988
01:06:13,292 --> 01:06:17,250
孩儿她妈，过来，握住你女儿的手
Mum, get yourself round here, and hold your daughter's hand.

989
01:06:17,417 --> 01:06:21,167
好，捏你妈妈的手，一次是：是，两次是：否
Okay. Squeeze your mum's hand once for yes, twice for no.

990
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:23,292
明白了吗？别说话
Understand? Don't talk.

991
01:06:23,667 --> 01:06:24,792
是
Yes.

992
01:06:24,875 --> 01:06:28,167
有没有血小板减少症？头疼？瘀伤？
Any signs of thrombocytopenia? Headaches? Bruising?

993
01:06:28,792 --> 01:06:29,875
否
No.

994
01:06:29,958 --> 01:06:33,250
阿司匹林类药？宝治灵？替钾？消炎药？
Aspirin products? Bonjela? Teejel? Anti-inflammatories?

995
01:06:33,292 --> 01:06:34,417
没有，一个都没有
No, none of those. No.

996
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:35,583
好
Good.

997
01:06:35,875 --> 01:06:37,875
现在，恐怕我们要用灼伤性方式给你的鼻子消毒
Now I'm afraid we're going to need to cauterize your nose.

998
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:40,458
以前做过灼伤性消毒吗？-是的，她说做过
Have you been cauterized before? -Yes, she has.

999
01:06:40,542 --> 01:06:42,292
好的，我们检查一下你的血小板
Okay. We'll check your platelets,

1000
01:06:42,375 --> 01:06:45,250
然后你需要输至少两个单位的血小板
and then you're going to need at least a couple of units.

1001
01:06:45,333 --> 01:06:48,083
今晚会很难过，不过你明天一早就可以回家了
A rough night, but you'll be back home tomorrow.

1002
01:06:49,375 --> 01:06:51,458
我们知道病症所在了
We got there in the end.

1003
01:07:13,417 --> 01:07:17,292
大夫说是晚期鼻子出血，你知道，严重的那种
They said it was a posterior nosebleed, the...You know, the bad kind.

1004
01:07:20,208 --> 01:07:24,125
他们给她的鼻子做了血管……
They had to pack her nose with vaso...

1005
01:07:25,042 --> 01:07:26,292
血管收缩术
Vasoconstrictive.

1006
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:28,542
对，血管收缩药
Yeah, vasoconstrictive agents.

1007
01:07:28,583 --> 01:07:31,917
在那之前，输了两个单位的血，还做了血小板计数
And before they transfused in two units, they did a platelet count.

1008
01:07:33,042 --> 01:07:34,167
还有呢？
And?

1009
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,042
稳定了
Stable.

1010
01:07:46,125 --> 01:07:47,625
你干得不错
You did well.

1011
01:07:52,208 --> 01:07:54,125
我在这，你要是有事的话可以走了
I'm here, you can go now if you want.

1012
01:07:57,375 --> 01:07:58,458
我能留下吗？
Can I stay?

1013
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:04,583
当然了
Yeah.

1014
01:08:49,417 --> 01:08:51,083
你感觉怎么样？
How are you feeling?

1015
01:08:52,042 --> 01:08:53,417
困
Sleepy...

1016
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,417
谢谢你能陪我
Thank you for being there.

1017
01:08:57,625 --> 01:09:01,000
我真是被你吓坏了，还有你的男朋友
It was a bit of a shock. For your boy, too.

1018
01:09:02,333 --> 01:09:03,792
我能理解
It was understandable.

1019
01:09:10,083 --> 01:09:11,708
那孩子真挺招人喜欢的，跟奶酥似的
He's a hot buttered biscuit, that one.

1020
01:09:14,292 --> 01:09:16,750
是啊，我也是这么形容他的
Yeah, that's exactly how I'd describe him.

1021
01:09:17,042 --> 01:09:18,833
你会怎么跟他说？
What would you say?

1022
01:09:21,208 --> 01:09:24,083
他要没跟我在一起，我就随便编个理由
When he's not with me, I think I've made him up.

1023
01:09:26,625 --> 01:09:28,667
他没再打电话或者跟到医院去吧？
He didn't call or come after us, or anything?

1024
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:31,833
没有
No.

1025
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:35,625
也许我应该骗他
Maybe I did make him up.

1026
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:41,000
天呐
Good God.

1027
01:09:42,333 --> 01:09:43,375
怎么了？
What?

1028
01:09:43,583 --> 01:09:45,500
看那，在桥上
There, on the bridge.

1029
01:09:52,625 --> 01:09:54,083
真奇怪
That's odd.

1030
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:02,917
到处都是你的名字，泰萨！
You're everywhere, Tessa!

1031
01:10:21,667 --> 01:10:23,083
是他干的
He's done it.

1032
01:10:25,625 --> 01:10:27,583
他把我的名字写得到处都是
He's put my name in the world.

1033
01:10:38,792 --> 01:10:40,917
杂耍棍！你给我买了杂耍滚！
Juggling clubs! You brought me juggling clubs!

1034
01:10:41,583 --> 01:10:42,792
生日快乐！
Happy birthday.

1035
01:10:42,875 --> 01:10:43,958
你会玩吗？
Can you do these?

1036
01:10:44,333 --> 01:10:45,667
会，会一点
Yeah. A bit, yeah.

1037
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:47,417
你要是想学我待会教你
I'll help you practice later if you want.

1038
01:10:47,833 --> 01:10:49,542
爸爸，亚当能留下吃晚饭吗？
Dad, can Adam stay for dinner?

1039
01:10:49,708 --> 01:10:50,750
不行
No.

1040
01:10:51,458 --> 01:10:52,542
妈妈
Mum...

1041
01:10:52,625 --> 01:10:53,792
我又不住在这，说了不算吧？
I don't live here, do I?

1042
01:10:54,542 --> 01:10:55,750
谢谢你
Thank you.

1043
01:10:55,833 --> 01:10:56,958
不过还是让他留下吧
But let him stay.

1044
01:10:57,458 --> 01:10:58,917
你们串通好了的
It's a conspiracy.

1045
01:11:00,792 --> 01:11:02,958
好吧，我表演个魔术
All right,on with the magic show.

1046
01:11:03,042 --> 01:11:04,125
挑一张牌
Pick a card.

1047
01:11:06,708 --> 01:11:07,750
红桃五
Five of hearts.

1048
01:11:08,042 --> 01:11:09,083
不是
No.

1049
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:11,625
总有一天我能猜出来
One day I'll get the right one,

1050
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:13,125
你们都是废物
and you'll all crap yourselves.

1051
01:11:13,250 --> 01:11:15,875
哦，好哇，你现在都能说脏话啦？
Oh, nice. He's allowed to say that, is he?

1052
01:11:15,958 --> 01:11:17,708
只能说“废物”
It's only "crap."

1053
01:11:42,417 --> 01:11:44,375
好了，又有一件事可以从清单上划掉了
Well, that's another one to cross off the list.

1054
01:11:49,042 --> 01:11:50,750
你那清单还剩多少？
How's the list going?

1055
01:11:51,542 --> 01:11:55,250
剩下的我觉得都不重要了
Things I thought mattered don't matter so much anymore.

1056
01:11:56,875 --> 01:11:59,625
你怎么样？有什么计划吗？
How about you? Got anything you wanna put up there?

1057
01:12:01,042 --> 01:12:02,417
我还行
I'm fine.

1058
01:12:04,375 --> 01:12:07,083
我意思是，我有点……
I mean, there are things I've kind of,

1059
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:10,208
你知道，选择对我来说……
you know, opted out of I guess.

1060
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:16,292
不，我跟你还不一样
No, I'm not like you like that.

1061
01:12:16,375 --> 01:12:18,375
我不能……
I don't...

1062
01:12:19,042 --> 01:12:20,083
亚当？
Adam?

1063
01:12:20,208 --> 01:12:21,292
啊
Yeah.

1064
01:12:22,875 --> 01:12:25,208
你的生活还要继续
You've got to get in the game.

1065
01:12:28,375 --> 01:12:30,375
所以好好想想
So have a think.

1066
01:12:31,375 --> 01:12:35,542
你将来想干吗？你的梦想是什么？
What are your hopes,your dreams?

1067
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:40,417
现在就说？
Right now?

1068
01:12:41,125 --> 01:12:42,292
对
Yeah.

1069
01:12:51,583 --> 01:12:53,708
松开我的手，松开
Let go of my hand. Let go of my hand.

1070
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:55,250
我会松开的
I'll wipe out.

1071
01:12:55,333 --> 01:12:56,875
好吧，我会在你周围看着的
Yeah, but I'll be miles away.

1072
01:12:58,208 --> 01:13:00,875
来吧，自己试试，身体前倾往前滑就行了
Go on, all the way across. Just lean forward and run.

1073
01:13:00,917 --> 01:13:02,542
你能行的 
You can do it.

1074
01:13:03,208 --> 01:13:04,792
前倾往前走，明白了
Lean and run, got it.

1075
01:13:07,542 --> 01:13:10,292
滑起来！泰萨·斯科特来啦！
Get in! Tessa Scott is in the house!

1076
01:13:14,458 --> 01:13:15,458
卡尔，怎么停下来啊？
Cal, how do you stop?

1077
01:13:15,542 --> 01:13:16,542
撞墙
Use the wall.

1078
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:18,417
卡尔！-扶墙！
Cal! -Use the wall!

1079
01:13:21,208 --> 01:13:22,375
嘿，宝贝
Hi, babe.

1080
01:13:23,042 --> 01:13:24,292
嘿
Hey.

1081
01:13:27,792 --> 01:13:29,375
你滑得不错
You looked good out there.

1082
01:13:29,875 --> 01:13:32,958
我老摔跤，现在屁股还疼呢
I kept falling down.My bum hurts.

1083
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:36,083
你应该弄点冰冷敷一下
You should put some ice on it.

1084
01:13:42,208 --> 01:13:43,583
我想把孩子生下来
I'm keeping the baby.

1085
01:13:48,375 --> 01:13:49,583
真的？
Really?

1086
01:13:51,208 --> 01:13:53,708
对呀，生下来
Yeah. Yes.

1087
01:13:55,875 --> 01:13:59,250
是个女孩，我将有个女儿了
It's a girl. I'm having a girl.

1088
01:14:01,708 --> 01:14:04,083
我给她起了个名字叫劳伦
And I'm gonna call her Lauren.

1089
01:14:05,208 --> 01:14:06,708
我想要这个孩子
That's what I'm gonna do.

1090
01:14:07,875 --> 01:14:09,708
你生的时候我想去看看
I want to be there.

1091
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:12,500
你要是不想让我进产房
If you don't want me in the birth,

1092
01:14:12,542 --> 01:14:14,292
我就在外边，等你生完了我再看
then I can sit outside and come in afterwards.

1093
01:14:18,083 --> 01:14:19,458
我想当世界上第一个
I want to be one of the first people

1094
01:14:19,542 --> 01:14:21,542
抱你孩子的人
in the world to ever hold your baby.

1095
01:14:25,875 --> 01:14:27,750
还有五个月才生呢
It's five months away.

1096
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:31,125
这不就有目标了么
Then it's something to aim for.

1097
01:15:02,375 --> 01:15:05,083
你看，很多人觉得下雪很美
You see, some people would find this beautiful.

1098
01:15:05,208 --> 01:15:07,542
但是在我看来，这就是在屠杀我那些可怜的蔬菜
But all I can think is, it's killing my poor vegetables.

1099
01:15:10,875 --> 01:15:12,750
嘿，想什么呢，泰丝？
Hey, what's up, Tess?

1100
01:15:14,208 --> 01:15:17,417
我并不满足，对于我们，和这些美景
It's not enough. Us. This.

1101
01:15:18,417 --> 01:15:19,958
你的意思是？
How do you mean?

1102
01:15:20,750 --> 01:15:23,583
跟我在一起，和我一起住之类的
Stay with me. Stay the nights.

1103
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:28,625
你想让我做什么，泰丝？
What do you want from me, Tess?

1104
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:35,417
晚上，一起睡觉，早上一块起床，一起吃早饭
Nighttime. Sleeping together.Waking up together. Breakfast.

1105
01:15:37,625 --> 01:15:39,708
你真正想要的是什么？
What do you really want?

1106
01:15:44,375 --> 01:15:46,125
我想让你在黑暗里陪着我
I want you to be with me in the dark.

1107
01:15:48,542 --> 01:15:50,042
抱着我
To hold me.

1108
01:15:51,583 --> 01:15:53,375
一直爱我
To keep loving me.

1109
01:15:56,958 --> 01:15:59,250
在我害怕的时候安慰我
To help me when I get scared.

1110
01:16:02,292 --> 01:16:05,417
陪着我一直到最后看看会发生什么
To come right to the edge and see what's there.

1111
01:16:11,083 --> 01:16:13,083
要是我理解错了怎么办？
What if I get it wrong?

1112
01:16:14,417 --> 01:16:16,750
你不会理解错的
It's impossible to get wrong.

1113
01:16:36,125 --> 01:16:37,917
送给你的
For you.

1114
01:16:40,042 --> 01:16:41,792
这是雪天使
It's a snow angel.

1115
01:16:50,208 --> 01:16:52,583
不行，不行，不行
<i>No. No, no and no.</i>

1116
01:16:52,792 --> 01:16:54,583
爸爸……-这是你清单上的吗？
Dad... -Is this on the list?

1117
01:16:54,708 --> 01:16:57,708
让一个男孩子跟你一块住？想都别想，不可能
A boy staying over? Forget it. No.

1118
01:16:58,250 --> 01:16:59,792
要知道，这请求我问出来都挺难的
You know, this is not easy for me to ask.

1119
01:17:00,042 --> 01:17:01,875
但是回答起来很容易
Well, it's very easy for me to answer.

1120
01:17:02,875 --> 01:17:04,625
我还以为有商量的余地呢。-这事没得商量
I thought you wanted to talk. -Not about this.

1121
01:17:04,875 --> 01:17:06,708
我不同意。讨论结束
I won't permit it.End of discussion.

1122
01:17:07,417 --> 01:17:08,542
别这么独裁行么
Don't pull rank on me.

1123
01:17:09,417 --> 01:17:11,083
我就独裁了，我是你爸爸
I have rank. I'm your father.

1124
01:17:12,875 --> 01:17:14,708
当不了多久了
Not for much longer.

1125
01:17:23,458 --> 01:17:25,042
准备好了吗？
Are you ready?

1126
01:17:25,083 --> 01:17:27,125
太远了
It's too far.

1127
01:17:27,208 --> 01:17:28,208
你就跳吧
Just jump.

1128
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:29,917
太他妈远了
It's too bloody far.

1129
01:17:30,542 --> 01:17:31,708
那就别来了
Good night then.

1130
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:33,458
等会
Wait.

1131
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:36,125
你干吗呢？
What are you doing?

1132
01:17:36,375 --> 01:17:37,375
给自己打气啊
Psyching myself up.

1133
01:17:37,417 --> 01:17:38,583
哦，那还且着呢吧
Oh, is that gonna take a while,

1134
01:17:38,708 --> 01:17:39,875
我想去泡杯茶
'cause I quite fancy a cup of tea.

1135
01:17:41,208 --> 01:17:42,458
我的天呐
Oh, my God.

1136
01:17:44,542 --> 01:17:46,125
你没事吧？-我有事！
Are you all right? -No.

1137
01:17:46,375 --> 01:17:47,583
我摔着胳膊了
I've broken my arm.

1138
01:17:48,125 --> 01:17:49,125
俩胳膊都摔着了
Both arms.

1139
01:17:50,208 --> 01:17:51,583
我浑身都摔坏了
I've broken everything.

1140
01:17:54,208 --> 01:17:56,125
嗨。-嗨
Hi. -Hi.

1141
01:17:57,333 --> 01:17:58,333
噢
Ow.

1142
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:01,083
但是你进来了
But you're here.

1143
01:18:36,917 --> 01:18:38,417
他在你房间里，对吧？
He's in there, isn't he?

1144
01:18:43,708 --> 01:18:44,875
是啊
Yes.

1145
01:18:46,375 --> 01:18:48,542
我不是跟你说了不行的吗
I told you I didn't want that.

1146
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:51,417
我知道
I know.

1147
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:53,708
你知道为什么吗？
You know why?

1148
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:55,667
我知道
I think so.

1149
01:18:56,750 --> 01:18:58,750
他是个好孩子，泰萨
He's a good kid, Tessa.

1150
01:18:59,208 --> 01:19:02,042
但他只是个孩子，你不能全依赖他
But a kid is all he is. You can't rely on him.

1151
01:19:02,083 --> 01:19:03,417
他可能会让你失望的
He might let you down.

1152
01:19:04,917 --> 01:19:06,042
他不会的
He won't.

1153
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:09,083
如果他会呢？
What if he does?

1154
01:19:11,542 --> 01:19:16,042
那我不是还有你呢吗，就像以前一样
Then I'll still have you. Like always.

1155
01:19:37,083 --> 01:19:39,083
这个太他妈好吃了
These are insanely good.

1156
01:19:39,208 --> 01:19:40,958
我觉得他这洋葱炸过了
I think they fry the onions in hair oil.

1157
01:19:42,208 --> 01:19:44,208
因为咱们值得
Because we're worth it.

1158
01:19:54,958 --> 01:19:56,417
我也想学打水漂儿
I wish I could do that.

1159
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:57,625
你不会吗？
You can't?

1160
01:19:58,208 --> 01:19:59,292
不会
No.

1161
01:19:59,375 --> 01:20:01,708
我能让它漂两次，之后就不行了
I can do like two and then they just die.

1162
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:03,375
我教你
I'll teach you.

1163
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:05,917
我把它列进我的清单里去
I'll put it on my new list.

1164
01:20:06,542 --> 01:20:08,125
还有什么？
Along with what?

1165
01:20:10,208 --> 01:20:11,458
还有好多别的事
Too many things.

1166
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:18,125
春天，水仙花和郁金香
Spring. Daffodils and tulips.

1167
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:21,917
一次火车旅行
A long train journey.

1168
01:20:23,375 --> 01:20:24,750
看孔雀
A peacock.

1169
01:20:25,417 --> 01:20:27,250
在床上吃早餐
Bed and breakfast.

1170
01:20:27,417 --> 01:20:29,292
一大笔银行存款
A joint bank account.

1171
01:20:29,875 --> 01:20:32,208
年复一年地听你打呼噜
Listening to you snore for years and years.

1172
01:20:32,583 --> 01:20:34,000
我不打呼噜，我打吗？
I don't snore. Do I snore?

1173
01:20:34,375 --> 01:20:35,458
等你老了就会打的
You will when you get old.

1174
01:20:37,042 --> 01:20:40,292
为人父母，而且我们的孩子是个天才
To go to a parents' evening, and our child's a genius.

1175
01:20:40,375 --> 01:20:42,583
实际上，咱们将有三个孩子
Actually, all three of our kids.

1176
01:20:42,708 --> 01:20:43,792
咱们有三个孩子？
We're having three?

1177
01:20:43,875 --> 01:20:45,417
切斯特，玛丽莲和黛茜
Chester, Merlin and Daisy.

1178
01:20:46,792 --> 01:20:48,375
上帝保佑他们
God help them.

1179
01:20:49,583 --> 01:20:52,458
跟你在一起，跟你在一起
Being with you. Being with you.

1180
01:20:53,542 --> 01:20:55,250
跟你在一起
Being with you.

1181
01:20:56,708 --> 01:20:58,750
就跟你在一起
Just being with you.

1182
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:04,542
这么说，是爱情的力量把你治愈了吗？
So, is the love cure still working its magic?

1183
01:21:04,583 --> 01:21:05,708
这得你说
You tell me.

1184
01:21:06,458 --> 01:21:08,042
我应该把这方法告诉我的病人们
I should recommend it to all my patients.

1185
01:21:08,083 --> 01:21:09,708
太好了！我收到短信了
Yes! I got a text.

1186
01:21:10,417 --> 01:21:11,833
卡尔有了个新手机
Cal's got a mobile phone.

1187
01:21:11,958 --> 01:21:13,417
他长大了
He's growing up.

1188
01:21:13,458 --> 01:21:14,542
五岁组赢了！
Year Five won!

1189
01:21:14,583 --> 01:21:15,792
公园里打水仗的游戏
There was a water fight in the park

1190
01:21:15,875 --> 01:21:17,708
五岁组对七岁组，五岁的赢了！
against Year Seven, and we won!

1191
01:21:18,458 --> 01:21:20,292
卡尔，跟菲利帕说说你最近都在忙什么呢
Cal, tell Philippa what you've been doing recently.

1192
01:21:21,125 --> 01:21:23,125
哦，好哇，我最近在玩“装死”的游戏
Oh, yeah. I'm doing "keep death away" spells.

1193
01:21:23,458 --> 01:21:25,417
我把大蒜挂在门上
I've put garlic above all the doors

1194
01:21:25,542 --> 01:21:27,542
还有泰萨床的四角
and at the four corners of Tessa's bed.

1195
01:21:27,583 --> 01:21:30,708
这么弄虽然挺恶心的，不过我觉得……
Which is pretty bloody gross, but I figure...

1196
01:21:32,625 --> 01:21:33,750
怎么了？
What?

1197
01:21:35,375 --> 01:21:36,583
怎么了？
What is it?

1198
01:21:42,042 --> 01:21:43,208
泰萨？
Tessa?

1199
01:21:46,042 --> 01:21:47,208
你爸爸呢？
Where's your father?

1200
01:21:48,458 --> 01:21:52,292
他跟我妈妈说了些什么，他说什么了？
Telling my mum something. What's he telling her?

1201
01:21:54,042 --> 01:21:56,917
咱们等他们来了再说，好吗？
Let's wait for them to join us, shall we?

1202
01:21:57,375 --> 01:22:00,542
得病的是我，不是他们
It's me that's sick, not them.

1203
01:22:03,458 --> 01:22:05,208
我到什么程度了，告诉我吧？
How sick, please?

1204
01:22:09,542 --> 01:22:12,083
你最新的血细胞测试数量很低
Your latest blood counts are very low.

1205
01:22:14,083 --> 01:22:16,625
你的免疫系统正在衰退
Your immune system is in collapse.

1206
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:21,583
癌细胞已经扩散到全身了
The cancer is now everywhere.

1207
01:22:25,125 --> 01:22:27,250
我还有多长时间？
How much longer do I have?

1208
01:22:28,625 --> 01:22:30,917
我不想预测这个时间
I don't want to be drawn into time scales.

1209
01:22:32,875 --> 01:22:34,875
你说错了我不会告你的
I won't sue you if you're wrong.

1210
01:22:38,875 --> 01:22:41,250
我好朋友的预产期是四月
My best friend's due in April.

1211
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:45,083
我还能坚持到孩子出生吗？
Will I get to meet her baby?

1212
01:22:50,875 --> 01:22:51,917
不能
No.

1213
01:23:29,917 --> 01:23:31,333
亚当？
Adam?

1214
01:23:47,417 --> 01:23:48,542
亚当在吗？
Is Adam here?

1215
01:23:48,750 --> 01:23:51,500
哦，他不在，抱歉，他得晚上才能回来呢
Oh, no, I'm sorry, darling. He won't be back till this evening.

1216
01:23:52,208 --> 01:23:54,375
来不及了，他去哪了？
That's too late. Where's he gone?

1217
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:57,167
他上火车了，去参加接待日
He's on the train. For the Open Day.

1218
01:23:59,375 --> 01:24:01,917
接待日？-对，大学入学的接待日
Open Day? -Yeah, at the university.

1219
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:04,042
听说他九月份要去上大学
I was so thrilled when he said he was

1220
01:24:04,208 --> 01:24:05,750
我真是太高兴了
taking up his place in September.

1221
01:24:06,417 --> 01:24:07,917
以前我还以为
There were times when I thought

1222
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,417
我们得再等上一年呢
we'd be waiting another 12 months.

1223
01:24:10,167 --> 01:24:13,833
谁也不想当班上岁数最大的学生，是吧？
No one wants to be the oldest kid in the class, do they?

1224
01:24:15,042 --> 01:24:18,708
是啊，没有人愿意那样
No. No one wants that.

1225
01:25:27,583 --> 01:25:28,917
泰萨？
Tessa?

1226
01:25:30,667 --> 01:25:32,542
泰萨，你在吗？
Tessa, are you here?

1227
01:25:37,042 --> 01:25:38,417
亲爱的
Darling?

1228
01:25:45,833 --> 01:25:47,000
不
No.

1229
01:25:49,417 --> 01:25:50,708
你这个怪物
You monster.

1230
01:25:53,875 --> 01:25:56,250
你能不能给我留点好印象啊？
Do you want to leave me with nothing?

1231
01:26:02,708 --> 01:26:06,250
这就是你那份清单吗？
Is this it? The list.

1232
01:26:09,542 --> 01:26:10,833
一直就在这写着
It was here all along.

1233
01:26:14,708 --> 01:26:16,750
你以前为什么不给我看？
Why didn't you show me?

1234
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:18,875
你应该给我看看
You should've shown me.

1235
01:26:20,375 --> 01:26:23,167
这上边有些事我帮不了你
Some of these,I could've helped you.

1236
01:26:23,875 --> 01:26:26,042
我真的很想帮你
I just wanted to help you.

1237
01:26:26,875 --> 01:26:28,375
可是我帮不了你
I couldn't help you.

1238
01:26:29,583 --> 01:26:30,917
我帮不了你
I can't help you.

1239
01:26:32,708 --> 01:26:35,542
我不想让你死
I don't want you to go.

1240
01:26:36,542 --> 01:26:38,750
我不想让你死
I don't want you to go.

1241
01:26:38,875 --> 01:26:40,417
我承担不了
I can't bear it.

1242
01:26:40,917 --> 01:26:42,708
让我跟你一块死吧
Take me with you.

1243
01:26:43,375 --> 01:26:44,917
哦，求你了
Oh, please...

1244
01:26:45,542 --> 01:26:48,542
我不想让你死
I don't want you to go.

1245
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,542
我不想让你死
I don't want you to go.

1246
01:26:52,875 --> 01:26:54,333
哦，宝贝……
Oh, baby...

1247
01:26:55,667 --> 01:26:57,542
噢，我的宝贝……
Oh, you're my baby...

1248
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:30,083
天呐，泰萨，我找你一天了
Jesus, Tess,I've been looking all over.

1249
01:27:30,417 --> 01:27:31,833
你来了多久了？
How long have you been up here?

1250
01:27:32,917 --> 01:27:34,750
你为什么不告诉我？
Why didn't you tell me?

1251
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:39,875
你不能走那么远的路知道吗？
You can't be making that walk, right?

1252
01:27:39,958 --> 01:27:41,042
跟我回去吧，好吗
Just come back with me, please.

1253
01:27:41,333 --> 01:27:43,333
你为什么不告诉我？
Why didn't you tell me?

1254
01:27:45,708 --> 01:27:47,500
因为我
Because it's gonna be me!

1255
01:27:47,542 --> 01:27:49,542
因为最后留下的那个人是我
It's gonna be me that's left behind on my own.

1256
01:27:49,583 --> 01:27:51,083
你还敢说
Don't you dare feel sorry for yourself

1257
01:27:51,208 --> 01:27:52,708
你是最后留下的那个
because you get to stay behind.

1258
01:27:52,750 --> 01:27:54,083
甭跟我说着个！
Don't you fucking dare!

1259
01:27:54,208 --> 01:27:55,500
这才是你想要的
This is what you wanted.

1260
01:27:56,333 --> 01:27:58,208
我知道，这就是你想看到的
Come on, I know it. This is what you wanted.

1261
01:27:58,250 --> 01:27:59,583
你想让我往前走……
For me to go on and...

1262
01:28:00,375 --> 01:28:02,708
哦，你得理解我
Oh, please, you've got to know that

1263
01:28:02,875 --> 01:28:04,458
要不是因为你，
if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be able

1264
01:28:04,542 --> 01:28:07,333
我哪也不会去，什么也不会干的
to go anywhere or do anything.

1265
01:28:07,375 --> 01:28:10,042
除了，也许除了我们在院子里认识的那天
Except, I don't know, fucking garden.

1266
01:28:31,042 --> 01:28:32,542
这一天迟早会来的
It's going to happen.

1267
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:35,708
我知道
I know.

1268
01:28:38,042 --> 01:28:39,208
快了
Soon.

1269
01:28:42,917 --> 01:28:44,417
好吗？
All right?

1270
01:28:53,167 --> 01:28:54,917
大学里怎么样？
So what was it like there?

1271
01:28:58,208 --> 01:29:01,167
很大，有好多楼，我差点迷路
Big, lots of buildings.I got a bit lost.

1272
01:29:02,542 --> 01:29:04,417
咱们会想出办法的
We'll figure it out.

1273
01:29:06,083 --> 01:29:07,917
会吗？-会的
We will? -Yeah.

1274
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:11,042
我会托生在别人身上的
I'm coming back as somebody else.

1275
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,083
我会变成一长发女孩，在重生的第一天就去找你
I'll be the wild-haired girl that walks up to you on day one,

1276
01:29:15,208 --> 01:29:17,542
然后问你在学什么
and ask what you're studying.

1277
01:29:19,375 --> 01:29:22,542
然后我们会一见钟情
And I'll fall in love with you at first sight.

1278
01:29:23,167 --> 01:29:24,375
第二次一见钟情
Again.

1279
01:31:00,042 --> 01:31:02,042
跟我说说我会怎么样吧
Tell me how it will be.

1280
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,875
从现在开始你会不想吃东西
You won't want to eat much from now on.

1281
01:31:11,375 --> 01:31:13,208
你会很渴
You'll be thirsty.

1282
01:31:14,042 --> 01:31:16,333
而且可能会发烧
And sometimes feverish.

1283
01:31:19,417 --> 01:31:21,708
你的睡眠时间会减少
<i>You'll want to sleep a lot.</i>

1284
01:31:22,208 --> 01:31:25,000
你的体力会渐渐丧失
<i>You'll have little or no energy.</i>

1285
01:31:26,542 --> 01:31:27,917
会疼吗？
<i>Will it hurt?</i>

1286
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:32,750
不会，吗啡会让你感觉不到任何疼痛
No. The morphine will make sure you're not in any pain.

1287
01:31:34,583 --> 01:31:36,417
那会让你做很多美梦
It will give you some beautiful dreams.

1288
01:31:41,208 --> 01:31:42,583
嗨
Hi, there.

1289
01:31:44,042 --> 01:31:45,917
我老是想着看看你的孩子
I keep thinking I've met your baby.

1290
01:31:50,583 --> 01:31:51,917
她怎么样？
How is she?

1291
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:54,708
特别好
Gorgeous.

1292
01:31:58,167 --> 01:31:59,583
会很爱她的
You'll love her.

1293
01:32:06,875 --> 01:32:08,125
这是真的吗？
Is this happening?

1294
01:32:08,250 --> 01:32:09,583
是啊
Yeah.

1295
01:32:13,042 --> 01:32:14,708
我现在都分不清真假了
I don't know what's real.

1296
01:32:15,750 --> 01:32:17,167
我能
I am.

1297
01:32:21,208 --> 01:32:23,583
你觉得我会害怕吗？
<i>Do you think I'll be scared?</i>

1298
01:32:25,708 --> 01:32:28,417
我觉得你运气好差啊
<i>I think you've had the worst luck in the world,</i>

1299
01:32:28,542 --> 01:32:31,708
如果我是你，我肯定会害怕
<i>and if I was in your shoes, I would be scared.</i>

1300
01:32:37,167 --> 01:32:41,000
但是我也相信，你会撑过最后这几天的
But I also believe that however you handle these last few days

1301
01:32:41,042 --> 01:32:43,917
你会就此无憾
will be exactly as it should be done.

1302
01:32:44,667 --> 01:32:46,583
我就烦你说“剩下几天”这种话
I hate it when you say days.

1303
01:32:53,583 --> 01:32:57,583
很快你的意识就会模糊
<i>Quite soon you'll start to drift in and out of consciousness.</i>

1304
01:33:00,208 --> 01:33:02,042
有时候你连说话都困难
<i>Sometimes you won't be able to respond,</i>

1305
01:33:02,083 --> 01:33:05,833
但是你会感觉到周围的人，能听见他们说话
<i>but you'll know people are there, you'll hear them talk.</i>

1306
01:33:05,875 --> 01:33:08,250
谢谢你能一直陪着她
Thank you for staying with her.

1307
01:33:09,875 --> 01:33:11,333
我爱她
I love her.

1308
01:33:14,375 --> 01:33:18,250
最后，泰丝，你的灵魂就飘走了
And eventually, Tess, you'll just drift away.

1309
01:33:20,917 --> 01:33:22,417
你还有别的问题吗？
Do you have any other questions?

1310
01:33:26,833 --> 01:33:28,583
没有了
No. No.

1311
01:33:40,542 --> 01:33:42,042
你醒了
You're awake.

1312
01:33:42,375 --> 01:33:44,542
我想吃一根冰棍
Just getting an ice lolly.

1313
01:33:44,583 --> 01:33:46,750
你按个铃我给你拿多好？
Why didn't you ring the bell?

1314
01:33:47,208 --> 01:33:48,875
还在找治疗方案呐？
Still looking for a cure?

1315
01:33:51,208 --> 01:33:52,708
能有点安慰
Pain relief.

1316
01:33:57,208 --> 01:33:58,708
我能用会儿电脑吗？
Can I use the computer for a sec?

1317
01:33:59,542 --> 01:34:01,167
行啊，当然了
Yeah. Of course.

1318
01:34:01,208 --> 01:34:02,875
不，你别起来
No, you're good.

1319
01:34:11,542 --> 01:34:13,708
你的头发长出来了
Your hair's growing back.

1320
01:34:14,542 --> 01:34:16,292
还不够快
Not quick enough.

1321
01:34:18,667 --> 01:34:20,958
你要给我看什么？
What are you showing me here?

1322
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:23,625
一个更好的去处
A better site for you.

1323
01:34:24,292 --> 01:34:25,542
工作
Jobs.

1324
01:34:25,625 --> 01:34:27,125
你得开始想想了
You've got to start thinking.

1325
01:34:29,667 --> 01:34:30,958
现在不想
Not yet.

1326
01:34:33,708 --> 01:34:36,125
你得重新开始生活
You're gonna have a life again.

1327
01:34:36,625 --> 01:34:39,083
我从来没有自己的生活
I never had a life.

1328
01:34:39,125 --> 01:34:40,792
我是个会计
I was an accountant.

1329
01:34:43,208 --> 01:34:45,458
但是现在，你什么都能做
And now you can do anything.

1330
01:34:47,375 --> 01:34:48,875
我告诉泰萨和爸爸，
I'm telling Tessa and Dad,

1331
01:34:48,958 --> 01:34:50,167
还有所有我认识的人
and then everyone else I know.

1332
01:34:50,292 --> 01:34:52,000
我没有。-妈妈喜欢威尔莫特先生
Because I don't. -Mum fancies Mr. Wilmot.

1333
01:34:52,042 --> 01:34:53,292
我没有，我从来没这么说过
I do not. I never said that.

1334
01:34:53,417 --> 01:34:54,750
你说了，你说了
You did, you did.

1335
01:34:54,792 --> 01:34:56,583
妈妈喜欢威尔莫特先生
Mum fancies Mr. Wilmot.

1336
01:34:56,667 --> 01:34:59,000
所有的妈妈都喜欢威尔莫特先生
All the mums fancy Mr. Wilmot.

1337
01:34:59,292 --> 01:35:01,208
还有一些父亲也喜欢他
And a few of the dads.

1338
01:35:02,667 --> 01:35:04,125
嘿，你感觉怎么样？
Hey. How are you feeling?

1339
01:35:04,625 --> 01:35:06,125
你去哪了？
Where have you been?

1340
01:35:06,208 --> 01:35:09,333
我参加了一个家长教学会
I have been to a parent-teacher meeting.

1341
01:35:09,833 --> 01:35:11,042
你去啦？
You went to that?

1342
01:35:11,542 --> 01:35:13,000
她去了
She did. Yeah.

1343
01:35:13,042 --> 01:35:14,708
太他妈没劲了
And it bored the hole off me.

1344
01:35:14,875 --> 01:35:16,542
除了威尔莫特先生？
Except for Mr. Wilmot?

1345
01:35:17,208 --> 01:35:19,375
他说我干得不错，所以妈妈给我买了这个
He said I was doing great, so Mum got me this.

1346
01:35:20,125 --> 01:35:22,042
把它甩起来那声音就跟唱歌似的
You spin it round and it kind of sings.

1347
01:35:22,125 --> 01:35:24,000
对，但是别在屋里玩儿行吗？
Yeah,but not in the house, right?

1348
01:35:25,208 --> 01:35:26,625
你怎么起来了？
How come you're up?

1349
01:35:27,458 --> 01:35:28,792
出汗了吗？
Are you sweating?

1350
01:35:31,042 --> 01:35:32,250
我去把你的床单换一下
I'll change your sheets for you.

1351
01:35:32,375 --> 01:35:33,625
我去吧
I'll do it.

1352
01:35:33,708 --> 01:35:34,875
我会铺床
I can make a bed.

1353
01:35:34,958 --> 01:35:37,167
你要是知道就不会在医院被折叠床夹到屁股了
You wouldn't know a hospital corner if it bit you on the arse.

1354
01:35:37,208 --> 01:35:38,708
胡说八道
That is not true.

1355
01:35:38,792 --> 01:35:40,292
好吧，我出去玩
Fine, I'll do it outside.

1356
01:35:40,375 --> 01:35:42,500
来呀，泰萨，这玩意甩起来真的像唱歌一样
Come and have a listen, Tess. It kind of sings.

1357
01:35:55,708 --> 01:35:59,542
我这就来
I'm coming.Be there in a second.

1358
01:36:26,958 --> 01:36:29,000
不会有事的
It's gonna be all right.

1359
01:36:53,667 --> 01:36:54,833
亚当！
Adam!

1360
01:36:54,875 --> 01:36:56,042
哦，好
Yes, beautiful.

1361
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,958
别让我掉下去。-我在这呢
Don't let me fall. -I've got you.

1362
01:37:00,208 --> 01:37:01,250
我在往下掉
I'm falling.

1363
01:37:01,333 --> 01:37:03,083
你没有，你没往下掉
You're not falling. You're not falling.

1364
01:37:14,042 --> 01:37:15,833
时刻……
<i>Moments...</i>

1365
01:37:20,042 --> 01:37:22,542
我们的生命是由一连串的时刻组成的
<i>Our life is a series of moments.</i>

1366
01:37:24,625 --> 01:37:26,958
每一个时刻都通往一个结果
<i>Each one a journey to the end.</i>

1367
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,708
随他们去吧
<i>Let them go.</i>

1368
01:37:40,875 --> 01:37:42,625
都随他们去吧
<i>Let them all go.</i>

1369
01:37:44,375 --> 01:37:46,000
你应该道个别
<i>You should say goodbye, Cal.</i>

1370
01:37:47,375 --> 01:37:48,375
不
No.

1371
01:37:48,917 --> 01:37:50,167
别这样，亲爱的，这很重要
Come on, love, it's important.

1372
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:53,042
我一说她可能就死了
It might make her die.

1373
01:37:53,875 --> 01:37:56,833
不会的，好吗？
Nothing you say can make her die. Okay?

1374
01:37:58,958 --> 01:38:01,125
嘿，我们都在这儿，泰萨
Hey, we're all here, Tessa.

1375
01:38:01,875 --> 01:38:03,875
我们都非常爱你
We all love you so much.

1376
01:38:06,667 --> 01:38:07,833
你干得棒极了
You've done so well.

1377
01:38:10,958 --> 01:38:14,375
你可以去了，去吧
You can go now. You can go.

1378
01:38:17,167 --> 01:38:18,250
再见，泰丝
Bye, Tess.

1379
01:38:18,333 --> 01:38:21,208
让你的灵魂来找我吧，我不怕了
Haunt me if you like. I don't mind.

1380
01:38:34,042 --> 01:38:36,542

01:40:01,708 --> 01:40:05,083
<i> Outside the cars speed by</i>

1392
01:40:06,042 --> 01:40:09,083
<i> I never heard them until now</i>

1393
01:40:11,583 --> 01:40:13,833
<i> I know you care</i>

1394
01:40:14,667 --> 01:40:17,917
<i> I know
it is always been there</i>

1395
01:40:19,542 --> 01:40:23,042
<i> But there's trouble ahead,
I can feel it</i>

1396
01:40:23,542 --> 01:40:27,458
<i> You are just saving
yourself when you hide it</i>

1397
01:40:28,417 --> 01:40:30,750
<i> Yeah, I know you care</i>

1398
01:40:32,083 --> 01:40:35,542
<i> I see it in the way you stare</i>

1399
01:40:36,333 --> 01:40:40,625
<i> As if there was trouble
ahead and you knew it</i>

1400
01:40:40,875 --> 01:40:44,583
<i> I'll be saving myself
from the ruin</i>

1401
01:40:45,042 --> 01:40:47,542
<i> And I know you care</i>

1402
01:40:53,833 --> 01:40:56,958
<i> I used to run down the stairs</i>

1403
01:40:58,167 --> 01:41:01,042
<i> To the door
and I thought you were there</i>

1404
01:41:02,208 --> 01:41:05,500
<i> Do you shape
through the comfort of us</i>

1405
01:41:06,958 --> 01:41:10,000
<i> Two lovers loved out of love</i>

1406
01:41:11,167 --> 01:41:14,000
<i> Oh, but I know you care</i>

1407
01:41:15,417 --> 01:41:18,250
<i> I know
it is always been there</i>

1408
01:41:20,208 --> 01:41:23,625
<i> But there's trouble ahead,
I can feel it</i>

1409
01:41:24,208 --> 01:41:28,083
<i> You are just saving
yourself when you hide it</i>

1410
01:41:29,208 --> 01:41:31,500
<i> Yeah, I know you care</i>

1411
01:41:32,708 --> 01:41:36,125
<i> I see it in the way you stare</i>

1412
01:41:36,917 --> 01:41:40,875
<i> As if there was trouble
ahead and you knew it</i>

1413
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:45,500
<i> I'll be saving myself
from the ruin</i>

1414
01:41:45,958 --> 01:41:49,542
<i> And know it wasn't
always wrong</i>

1415
01:41:51,042 --> 01:41:55,042
<i> But I've never known
a winter so cold</i>

1416
01:41:55,125 --> 01:41:58,500
<i> Now I don't warm my hands
in your coat</i>

1417
01:41:59,167 --> 01:42:01,458
<i> But I still hope</i>

1418
01:42:03,958 --> 01:42:07,958
<i> 'Cause this is how things
ought to have been</i>

1419
01:42:08,042 --> 01:42:11,958
<i> And I know the worst of it
wasn't all that it seemed</i>

1420
01:42:12,042 --> 01:42:14,208
<i> Why can't I dream</i>

1421
01:42:16,333 --> 01:42:18,708
<i> Why can't I dream</i>

1422
01:42:20,292 --> 01:42:22,958
<i> 'Cause I know you care</i>

1423
01:42:24,750 --> 01:42:27,417
<i> And I know you care</i>

1424
01:42:29,375 --> 01:42:31,375
<i> I know you care</i>

1425
01:42:33,375 --> 01:42:35,250
<i> I know you care</i>

1426
01:42:37,542 --> 01:42:40,792
<i> I know it's always
been there </i>
