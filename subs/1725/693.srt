1
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:37,728
- What is it?
- Felix is looking for you.

2
00:01:37,728 --> 00:01:40,861
- Did you see him?
- Yes, he came by the house.

3
00:01:41,031 --> 00:01:43,880
- Did mum see him ?
- Yes, of course.

4
00:01:44,864 --> 00:01:48,397
- Did she say something?
- That he was very handsome.

5
00:01:55,452 --> 00:01:57,651
- Will you promise me not to tell mum?
- Yes.

6
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:00,644
- Why do you not want to say something?
- She has nothing to do with it. It is my life.

7
00:02:00,644 --> 00:02:03,196
Sure if you say so,
I am not saying anything.

8
00:02:03,196 --> 00:02:06,488
I do not want her to ask me questions:
What do you do, how did you meet? ...

9
00:02:06,488 --> 00:02:09,355
Where does he come from?
- Are you in love?

10
00:02:09,577 --> 00:02:11,753
Tell me, Isabelle!
Are you in love?

11
00:02:11,753 --> 00:02:15,020
- And how about you?
- I do not know. I am a guy.

12
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:27,204
YOUNG & PRETTY

13
00:02:28,947 --> 00:02:32,947
Come on, let us clear the table.
Guys, can you help us, too?

14
00:02:33,046 --> 00:02:34,546
- Let's go swimming!

15
00:02:35,076 --> 00:02:37,452
- You have to tidy first,
we go for a swim later.

16
00:02:37,452 --> 00:02:41,028
- Mum, can we go to the beach?
- Not now. You have to digest before.

17
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:44,504
- Please, Mum .
- You are going at four, after the nap.

18
00:02:44,504 --> 00:02:46,821
- We do not do siesta,
we are not kids.

19
00:02:46,821 --> 00:02:50,114
- I am no child,
but just take siesta!

20
00:02:50,674 --> 00:02:52,699
Let me!
Let me go!

21
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:06,314
- Your German friend came.
- Yes, I know.

22
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:10,052
- He seems nice. He is called Felix, right?
- Yes.

23
00:03:10,052 --> 00:03:12,955
- You should invite him to dinner.

24
00:03:12,956 --> 00:03:15,371
- No. It is too silly .

25
00:05:01,783 --> 00:05:04,316
- Did you saw him?
- Yes, there he is.

26
00:05:04,332 --> 00:05:08,034
- Where?
- There, he is playing tennis on the beach.

27
00:05:09,136 --> 00:05:10,793
Right there
Do you see?

28
00:05:11,232 --> 00:05:13,114
Shall we get down?

29
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:17,195
- Do you think?
- Clear, let us go.

30
00:05:25,204 --> 00:05:26,903
There he comes.

31
00:05:29,326 --> 00:05:32,459
Turn around or you will not see him!
- Shut up!

32
00:05:33,075 --> 00:05:36,466
- Hello, Felix.
- Hello.

33
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:42,457
- Hello, Isabelle.
- Hello.

34
00:05:46,157 --> 00:05:49,090
- Can I introduce my friend, Milan?
- Hello.

35
00:05:51,426 --> 00:05:53,861
- Are you fine?
- Yes, very fine, and you?

36
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:58,128
- I think, very well. With beach,
sun ... everything is perfect!

37
00:05:59,102 --> 00:06:03,146
Tonight we go to a disco ...
if you like to.

38
00:06:03,148 --> 00:06:07,361
- Yes, of course.
- Great. I will call and see you there

39
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:09,652
- Sure, if you like.
- Super.

40
00:06:09,887 --> 00:06:11,487
- See you.
- Great, bye.

41
00:06:32,338 --> 00:06:35,919
- There it is. Mira.
Finish it yourself!

42
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,882
Close it, I do not know
how you do it .

43
00:06:37,882 --> 00:06:39,865
- I light it.
- So soon?

44
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:45,941
- Is it alright? Do you like it?
- You look like a whore.

45
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,809
- Do you think?
- Clear. Look at me!

46
00:06:53,856 --> 00:06:55,616
- Gentle!

47
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,542
- That is better.

48
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:04,279
- I am going. Are you going
to our parents now, so I can leave?

49
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:07,212
- Okay, will you tell me later?
- I promise.

50
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:13,602
- Do you not want to sleep?
- No.

51
00:07:13,602 --> 00:07:15,838
- What are you doing then?
- Nothing.

52
00:07:15,838 --> 00:07:18,431
- What about your sister?
- She fell asleep, I think.

53
00:07:18,431 --> 00:07:22,865
- Did not she go to see her beloved German?
- No, she does not care .

54
00:07:22,865 --> 00:07:25,199
- Does he speak French?
- Yes.

55
00:07:25,452 --> 00:07:29,570
- Is it good?
- Coming from a German, yes.

56
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:33,600
- Put on your pyjamas and go to bed.
- Okay.

57
00:07:34,024 --> 00:07:37,733
- In any case, I have been to the
beach the whole day ...

58
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:40,600
... with Milan, who I introduced to you ...

59
00:07:40,734 --> 00:07:43,497
... and we went body-surfing.

60
00:07:43,987 --> 00:07:47,454
- Did you ever do body-surfing ?
- Yes.
- Yes, haha?

61
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,230
- Do you want some ice-cream?
- Yes.

62
00:07:55,363 --> 00:07:57,750
- Good evening, sir.

73
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,616
- Where are you coming from? Did your mother know?
- No.

74
00:11:14,616 --> 00:11:16,749
And you do not have to tell her.

75
00:11:22,227 --> 00:11:24,429
What are you doing here?

76
00:11:26,092 --> 00:11:27,876
- I was waiting.

77
00:11:29,711 --> 00:11:31,988

78
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,715

79
00:11:35,117 --> 00:11:39,251
- How was it?
- I do not want to talk about this with you, Victor.

80
00:11:39,251 --> 00:11:42,731
- Come on, you promised.
Did something go wrong?

81
00:11:42,732 --> 00:11:45,465
- No, not at all.
Go to bed in your room!

82
00:11:50,868 --> 00:11:52,960
Victor?

83
00:11:53,753 --> 00:11:57,323

- Special your sister is.

98
00:13:19,605 --> 00:13:22,743
- Why?
- I do not know.

99
00:13:24,702 --> 00:13:30,369
- I have ever met a girl like her .
- Is is because you are German and she is French.

100
00:13:32,624 --> 00:13:35,352
- Victor, can you help me, please?

101
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:41,079
- Are you sure, she does not expect something?
- No, she did not want to come.

102
00:13:43,428 --> 00:13:46,561

You do not have to cry.

Good afternoon ... Lea.

00:17:25,231 --> 00:17:27,106
- Good afternoon.

135
00:17:31,026 --> 00:17:34,075
- I know, I lied about my age.

136
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,400
Everyone does it, right?

137
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,406
- Do you mind?
- No.

138
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:46,317
- Nor are you like
the photos on the web.

139
00:17:46,317 --> 00:17:47,985
- I know.

140
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,136
- Do you want a drink?
- No.

141
00:17:55,263 --> 00:17:58,028
Or yes, a glass of water.

142
00:17:59,227 --> 00:18:01,518
- Sit!

143
00:18:20,118 --> 00:18:23,706
You are lovely.
Better than on the pictures.

00:18:26,885 --> 00:18:29,774
Student?

149
00:19:31,635 --> 00:19:35,857

150
00:19:35,858 --> 00:19:38,125

151
00:19:38,504 --> 00:19:42,104
- No, only in the evenings.
And I can not do weekends.

152
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:45,084
- What a pity.

153
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:48,627
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

154
00:20:39,256 --> 00:20:41,856
- What did you write there?
- Handsome.

155
00:21:03,226 --> 00:21:06,500
- Fine, I prepared the food. It is in the
fridge , you only have to heat it in the microwave.
- Okay.

156
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,643
- See you tomorrow.
- Victor, you have to study more grammar!

157
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,755
- Okay.
- Goodbye, Muna.

158
00:21:12,756 --> 00:21:14,756
- See you tomorrow.
- Goodbye.

159
00:21:17,665 --> 00:21:19,295
- I am exhausted.

160
00:21:22,465 --> 00:21:24,244
<i> Dating & You </i>

161
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:36,356
- You could knock before entering.
- What are you doing?

162
00:21:36,356 --> 00:21:40,089
- Leave me alone, I am working!
- Are you watching porn?

163
00:21:40,691 --> 00:21:43,779
- Get out!
- I, I will eat then.

164
00:22:17,372 --> 00:22:19,797
"At seventeen,
you can not be formal."

165
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:22,093
"One night,
you get sick of beer and lemonade ... "

166
00:22:22,093 --> 00:22:24,589
"the noisy cafes
with dazzling decades ..."

167
00:22:24,589 --> 00:22:26,685
"and you go under the green linden,
for a walk."

168
00:22:26,685 --> 00:22:29,137
"How rich smell lime green
on the nights of June!"

169
00:22:29,137 --> 00:22:31,709
"The air is sometimes so soft ,
to be closed eyelids."

170
00:22:31,709 --> 00:22:34,474
"The wind rustling
- the city is not far - ..."

171
00:22:34,474 --> 00:22:37,374
"brings aromas of vine
and beer."

172
00:22:37,404 --> 00:22:40,944
"Night of June: 17.
You let yourself be intoxicated."

173
00:22:40,979 --> 00:22:44,545
" The sap is champagne
that goes to your head, ramble."

174
00:22:44,545 --> 00:22:48,345
"You feel a kiss on your lips;
throbbing like an animal."

175
00:22:48,684 --> 00:22:51,062
"Your crazy heart, Robinsonea
through novels ..."

176
00:22:51,062 --> 00:22:53,697
"when clarity
a pale lantern ..."

177
00:22:53,732 --> 00:22:56,019
"spends a Miss
lovely look."

178
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:59,831
"To her, you seem very naive,
and trotting with his small boots ..."

179
00:22:59,831 --> 00:23:02,399
"turns, alert ,
and a living movement ..."

180
00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:04,610
"on your lips,
poems then die."

181
00:23:04,982 --> 00:23:06,677
"You arere in love,
laughs at your verses."

182
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:09,396
"All their friends are ,
you are unbearable."

183
00:23:09,396 --> 00:23:11,519
"And one night , your love
deigned to write."

184
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:14,414
"That night,
coffee again dazzled."

185
00:23:15,013 --> 00:23:19,546
"You order beer or lemonade.
At seventeen you can not be formal ..."

186
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:23,255
"when there is lime green
on the road."

187
00:23:24,668 --> 00:23:28,401
- You can see that Rimbaud speaks
drunkenness of nature.

188
00:23:28,778 --> 00:23:31,134
- And the excesses that lead to love.

189
00:23:31,134 --> 00:23:34,350
- Because being young,
Love goes through excesses, disinhibition ...

190
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:37,620
- At 17, one can fall in love
only during the holidays ...

191
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:42,768
- live a story, and to return to high school
have much to tell ...

192
00:23:42,768 --> 00:23:46,128
- because we fell in love
and that summer was cute.

193
00:23:46,128 --> 00:23:50,589
Falling in love, is revealed as a man.
Spend youth to be an adult.

194
00:23:51,084 --> 00:23:55,571
It is the intoxication of summer
insouciance, freedom ...

195
00:23:55,921 --> 00:23:57,580
- happiness, joy.

196
00:23:57,681 --> 00:24:01,054
In the third stanza,
"Robinsonea" is a neologism?

197
00:24:01,055 --> 00:24:03,894
Is he referring to Robinson Crusoe?

198
00:24:03,894 --> 00:24:07,305
- We're adventurous two months
and finally we are alone.

199
00:24:07,305 --> 00:24:14,262
- Begins and ends the same.
Life is like a circle, something infinite ...

200
00:24:14,263 --> 00:24:15,781
repeating,
whatever happens.

201
00:24:15,781 --> 00:24:19,432
- Not necessarily a poem
about the meeting ...

202
00:24:19,979 --> 00:24:26,848
It's more like a diagnosis,
on the dreams of young love.

203
00:24:27,731 --> 00:24:31,490
<i> Okay, tomorrow 5 pm, 300 Euros.
Which address?</i>

204
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:34,939
- Isabelle, are you coming to lunch?
- I am coming.

205
00:24:35,097 --> 00:24:37,387
- You write to your boyfriend?
- How do you know?

206
00:24:37,387 --> 00:24:39,107
- Easy to note.
You are radiant.

207
00:24:39,107 --> 00:24:41,430
- Is he not in high school?
- No, you are crazy.

208
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,563
- How old is he?
- 32 years old.

209
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:45,848
- I understand,
just assholes around here.

210
00:24:45,848 --> 00:24:49,463
- What does he do?
- He works as a lawyer.

211
00:24:50,604 --> 00:24:53,602
- Do you remember the old guy
we talked to in front of high school?

212
00:24:53,602 --> 00:24:55,226
- Yes.

213
00:24:55,228 --> 00:24:58,643
- It happened again to a friend of my sister.
But she did go through then.

214
00:24:58,643 --> 00:25:02,776
- Oh, really?
- Just to buy a Prada bag, can you imagine that?

215
00:25:09,233 --> 00:25:12,033
- Why is Isabelle always
in that bad mood?

216
00:25:15,216 --> 00:25:18,416
- Too bad you did not keep the
old guy's number.

217
00:25:18,962 --> 00:25:21,962
- Are you serious?
- No, I am just kidding.

218
00:25:22,372 --> 00:25:24,905
And also I do not like Prada handbags.

219
00:25:37,594 --> 00:25:39,094
- I am leaving.

220
00:25:39,532 --> 00:25:42,788
- What time are you coming back?
- During evening, I am going to see Claire.

221
00:25:42,788 --> 00:25:44,725
We are working
on a presentation.

222
00:25:44,725 --> 00:25:48,226
- Did you take my grey silk blouse?
- No.

223
00:25:48,227 --> 00:25:52,027
- Are you sure?
- Of course, do not bother me, I said no.

224
00:25:52,778 --> 00:25:54,683
- Hey, mind your tone!

225
00:25:57,374 --> 00:25:59,641
Have a nice day
and you work well!

226
00:26:01,154 --> 00:26:03,878
- Did you get how she speaks?

227
00:26:15,196 --> 00:26:16,696
- Excuse me.

228
00:26:59,106 --> 00:27:01,929
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

229
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,557
- Have a seat!

230
00:27:07,764 --> 00:27:10,181
- What is your name?
- Lea.

231
00:27:11,966 --> 00:27:14,394
- Very good choice.

232
00:27:17,161 --> 00:27:19,858
- How old are you?

233
00:27:23,199 --> 00:27:26,798
- And you are studying?

234
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,418
- Where?
- In La Sorbonne.

235
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:04,291
- Do you feel good?
- Yes, I am fine.

236
00:28:11,521 --> 00:28:13,289
- Do it to you yourself!

237
00:28:25,184 --> 00:28:26,792
In a natural way.

238
00:28:29,957 --> 00:28:32,581
Do not look at me!

239
00:28:36,338 --> 00:28:38,538
Turn around and
show me your ass!

240
00:28:48,215 --> 00:28:50,002
On your knees.

241
00:29:03,132 --> 00:29:04,880
Here.

242
00:29:11,146 --> 00:29:13,558
- Can I shower?
- No.

243
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:30,309
- What is it?
- My money.

244
00:29:30,533 --> 00:29:32,172
I am coming.

245
00:29:40,467 --> 00:29:42,000
It should be 300 Euros.

246
00:29:43,085 --> 00:29:45,509
- Sorry, no proof.
- We said 300.

247
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:51,567
- Come on, get out!
Or I will tell your parents you are a whore.

248
00:30:29,841 --> 00:30:33,344
<i>Okay, now, 500 Euros.</i>

249
00:30:44,651 --> 00:30:47,524
I want my money up-front.

250
00:30:49,611 --> 00:30:52,566
Okay, but for 500 you suck me
without a condom.

251
00:30:52,566 --> 00:30:55,633
- I do not know.
- Do not worry, I am married!

252
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:40,445
- Do you work only this?
- No, I do something different sometimes .

253
00:31:40,445 --> 00:31:42,870
- You know the saying?
- No.

254
00:31:43,396 --> 00:31:46,756
"A whore today,
a whore forever."

255
00:32:30,084 --> 00:32:34,229
- Did you know, that Isabelle is here?
- No, I have not heard her.

256
00:32:34,229 --> 00:32:38,891
- And she is taking a shower at this time.
- It is a woman thing.

257
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:50,350
Are you working?
- Yes, I have a paper to finish.

258
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:55,283
- You know you can work all day on Sunday.
- Do not worry, I will do this.

259
00:32:57,831 --> 00:33:01,472
- Do you not forget the theater tonight?
- Why do you not ask Victor?

260
00:33:01,472 --> 00:33:05,763
- Because he stays at his friend
Patrick and we would like you to come with us.

261
00:33:05,763 --> 00:33:07,973
- So I am stuck in.

262
00:33:08,972 --> 00:33:10,926
- You have to take a breath.

263
00:33:11,369 --> 00:33:15,436
- I, at your age ...
- I know, going to parties, cheesier ...

264
00:33:18,154 --> 00:33:22,287
- Hurry up! It will not be long
until we go to the restaurant.

265
00:33:52,737 --> 00:33:55,976
- How are you?
- How long have you been waiting?

266
00:33:56,634 --> 00:34:00,167
- We have to go now, it will start soon.
- We are ...

267
00:34:00,452 --> 00:34:03,652
- In the gallery.
- We are there. See you later.

268
00:34:04,191 --> 00:34:06,458
- See you in the break.
- See you.

269
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:16,519
- Where are they?

270
00:35:38,337 --> 00:35:41,670
<i>Ladies and Gentlemen,
please return to your seats!</i>

271
00:35:46,022 --> 00:35:48,155
- Did you see your mother?
- No.

272
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,570
- It will start now.

273
00:35:57,304 --> 00:35:58,837
- Excuse me,

274
00:36:11,342 --> 00:36:14,409
<i>See you on Wednesday.
Same time. Room 6095. G.</i>

275
00:37:47,129 --> 00:37:50,633
- Do you like the theater?
- Not much.

276
00:37:53,282 --> 00:37:57,268
- Did you come with your parents?
- Yeah, well, he is my stepfather.

277
00:37:57,268 --> 00:38:00,561
- Your mother is a beautiful woman.

278
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:06,080
- Do they not suspect something?
- No.

279
00:38:06,647 --> 00:38:08,227
- Better not.

280
00:38:10,525 --> 00:38:13,203
You would not lie about your age,
right?

281
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:21,845
- You are an adult, at least?
- Of course, I turned 18 this summer.

282
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:37,213
Thank you.

283
00:38:40,692 --> 00:38:42,939
- Do ou see many more?

284
00:38:44,979 --> 00:38:48,640
<i>Like you,
I have a heart ...</i>

285
00:38:49,678 --> 00:38:52,308
<i> can not promise anything ... </i>

286

288
00:39:00,134 --> 00:39:07,020
<i> Why hide it? </i>

289
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:14,324
<i> Why avoid it? </i>

290

<i> I have nothing to give you ... </i>

<i> Why avoid it? </i>

295
00:39:40,033 --> 00:39:45,258
<i> Why leave? </i>

296
00:39:49,496 --> 00:39:54,474
<i> By staying in your ivory tower ... </i>

297

<i> Solo.

<i> Solo.
Solo. </i>

302

- Is there anyone home?

303
00:41:03,682 --> 00:41:06,683
- Mum told me you had a girlfriend.
- Nothing to tell.

304
00:41:06,683 --> 00:41:10,949
- You can tell your older sister.
- And you, did you write your German guy?

305
00:41:10,949 --> 00:41:13,682
- No.
- Do you not want to see him again?

306
00:41:14,019 --> 00:41:17,819
- What for? He does not live here.
And Felix was nothing.

307
00:41:18,091 --> 00:41:21,091
- Did you enjoy yourself?
- Yes, it was nice.

308
00:41:21,344 --> 00:41:23,147
- Nice is not enough.

309
00:41:25,374 --> 00:41:28,742
So, how is your love ...
or your lover?

310
00:41:28,743 --> 00:41:32,400
- Nothing for you.
- I said, I am like you, I did not fall in love.

311
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,953
- What do you know?

312
00:41:38,358 --> 00:41:42,882
Do you masturbate now?
- Now, stop! You are a sexual freak.

313
00:41:43,412 --> 00:41:45,020
- Do you stumble?
- Shut up!

314
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:49,553
- Do you not watch stuff on the internet?
- I amm going to watch TV.

315
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:12,069
- Wait!

316
00:42:12,917 --> 00:42:15,231
- Do you not want to?

317
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:34,470
Are you married?
- Yes.

318
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,593
- Was it that woman in the theater?

319
00:42:39,883 --> 00:42:41,878
- No. She was my daughter.

320
00:42:44,934 --> 00:42:49,413
I was never a good father.
Did not care that much.

321
00:42:50,136 --> 00:42:54,842
She was resentful for long time, but then ...
now, we are better.

322
00:42:54,843 --> 00:42:58,602
Approached towards each other.
We go to the theater or to the movies together.

323
00:42:58,602 --> 00:43:00,354
And she likes me, too.

324
00:43:01,479 --> 00:43:03,097
- And as a husband?

325
00:43:05,738 --> 00:43:07,981
- I'm trying.

326
00:43:08,822 --> 00:43:12,104
And you?
- What?

327
00:43:12,104 --> 00:43:15,971
- Your father?
- There is nothing to say. It is my father.

328
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:25,493
- You can undress now.

329
00:44:02,532 --> 00:44:04,246
- Georges?

330
00:44:05,336 --> 00:44:07,519
Georges?

331
00:44:08,539 --> 00:44:10,236
Georges?!

332
00:44:20,644 --> 00:44:22,144
Georges?

333
00:44:36,934 --> 00:44:38,889
Georges!

334
00:44:39,373 --> 00:44:41,336
What the fuck?!

335
00:45:53,534 --> 00:45:58,236
- How did you do this?
- I told you: I fell after showering.

336
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:03,398
- I went through this obsession ...
showering all the time.

337
00:46:06,412 --> 00:46:09,124
I will put a patch
and have a small scab.

338
00:46:09,124 --> 00:46:12,613
- Will it last long?
- For the time to heal.

339
00:46:13,536 --> 00:46:16,004
There it is.
A cute patch.

340
00:46:16,618 --> 00:46:21,551
I remember your childhood
always coming back angry from the bloody school.

341
00:46:21,785 --> 00:46:23,581
Like a maniac.

342
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,511
- Winter -

343
00:46:44,313 --> 00:46:46,229
- Excuse me, good morning.
- Good morning.

344
00:46:46,229 --> 00:46:48,849
- Can wee talk to Mrs. Bontal, please?
- Do you have an appointment?

345
00:46:48,849 --> 00:46:50,604
- No, we are with the police.

346
00:46:50,604 --> 00:46:54,475
- My daughter, Isabelle?
- Isabelle ... or "Lea".

347
00:46:57,715 --> 00:47:02,982
- Lea? That is the name of my mother,
I do not know what you are talking about.

348
00:47:03,169 --> 00:47:05,236
- This is your daughter, right?

349
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,670
No?
- Yes, I think.

350
00:47:13,671 --> 00:47:17,004
- Georges Ferrière often met
your daughter, "Lea".

351
00:47:17,511 --> 00:47:20,911
- Your daughter has a double life.
As a prostitute.

352
00:47:22,055 --> 00:47:25,922
- She is 17, you must be wrong.
- No. It is her, no doubt.

353
00:47:26,792 --> 00:47:29,268
- About your daughter ... she is
as a witness not in danger.

354
00:47:29,268 --> 00:47:32,331
And the law consider her to be
a victim of this man.

355
00:47:32,331 --> 00:47:36,122
However, there is an investigation
ongoing, whether these acts ...

356
00:47:36,122 --> 00:47:39,922
happened on own will or are
linked to a network of pimps.

357
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:51,649
Today with the internet any child
can access porn sites.

358
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:54,490
You have no idea, unless you install
parental control.

359
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:57,707
- Did you never checke her messages
on her mobile phone?

360
00:47:57,707 --> 00:47:58,659
- No.

361
00:47:58,659 --> 00:48:01,126
- Ms. Bontal, do you know about this?

362
00:48:13,617 --> 00:48:16,412
- Did you know?
- No.

363
00:48:28,586 --> 00:48:31,211
- Are you going to the party at Benoit?
- I do not know yet.

364
00:48:31,211 --> 00:48:34,499
- Her parents left the department
for the entire weekend.

365
00:48:34,499 --> 00:48:37,822
- I do not know.
- Etienne is supposed to be there.

366
00:48:37,822 --> 00:48:40,042
I think it is an opportunity ...
sometime happens to one, do you not think ?

367
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,091
- Yes.

368
00:48:41,091 --> 00:48:45,096
- You can go come your boyfriend, if you want to.
- No, we are done.

369
00:48:45,096 --> 00:48:50,763
- Sorry, are you sad?
- No, it is better that way. There was this big age difference.

370
00:48:52,352 --> 00:48:55,061
- Are you leaving, Muna?
- Yes, your mother came.

371
00:48:55,061 --> 00:48:57,594
- What is it?
- It is not my business.

372
00:48:59,528 --> 00:49:02,130
- What is wrong?
- I do not know.

373
00:49:03,694 --> 00:49:05,194
See you tomorrow.

374
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:18,687
You have returned so soon?
- Go to your room, I have to talk to your sister!

375
00:49:20,232 --> 00:49:21,732
Come here, please!

376
00:49:32,725 --> 00:49:36,436
I know everything.
About Lea.

377
00:49:38,407 --> 00:49:39,907
Stay here!

378
00:49:41,315 --> 00:49:44,382
The police came.
Why did you not say anything?

379
00:49:46,158 --> 00:49:48,401
- Say what?
- Say what?!

380
00:49:48,912 --> 00:49:51,310
What you are doing?
A whore?

381
00:49:51,868 --> 00:49:54,401
You are a whore?
Is that funny to you?

382
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,606
And the death of this man,
do you see?

383
00:50:00,607 --> 00:50:04,406
Do you see?
You are disgusting!

384
00:50:04,408 --> 00:50:07,960
Do you realise how bad this?
Do you see?

385
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:12,007
Do you not think?
What is on your mind?!

386
00:50:12,507 --> 00:50:15,240
What is it with you?
Why did you do that?

387
00:50:15,558 --> 00:50:17,606
All that ...

388
00:50:35,181 --> 00:50:38,102
Isabelle, please.

389
00:50:38,638 --> 00:50:44,083
Isabelle, I am sorry.

390
00:50:45,088 --> 00:50:47,496
Forgive.

391
00:50:50,527 --> 00:50:52,027
What happened?

392
00:51:11,131 --> 00:51:12,631
Why?

393
00:51:19,295 --> 00:51:21,762
Did you use condoms, at least?
- Yes.

394
00:51:27,056 --> 00:51:30,423
- Promise me, you left it!
- Of course.

395
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:41,017
- Can you bring the potatoes,
please, Victor?

396
00:51:41,017 --> 00:51:42,517
Everyone to the table!

397
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,540
- I have good news.
- What?

398
00:51:53,069 --> 00:51:55,856
- For rentals.
- Did it work?

399
00:51:56,365 --> 00:51:58,605
- Yes, the cottage is available
the second week of February.

400
00:51:58,605 --> 00:52:01,604
- Are we going skiing?
- Yes, you can improve your level.

401
00:52:01,604 --> 00:52:04,875
- Sure, I 'm better than you.
- We will see.

402
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:08,850
- Will you come with us, Isabelle?

403
00:52:10,532 --> 00:52:13,266
- Of course. Why do you ask?

404
00:52:22,336 --> 00:52:27,079
- What did I do wrong?
- Stop accusing yourself!

405
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:30,153
- But why?
- It does not help you.

406
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:34,087
- I do not understand that I have not seen anything.

407
00:52:34,087 --> 00:52:36,754
- It is that your daughter is so pretty.

408
00:52:41,224 --> 00:52:45,224
- What do you mean?
- It is normal for this such "requests".

409
00:52:46,343 --> 00:52:47,930
- Are you kidding?
- What?

410
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:50,701
- Does it seem normal to be a whore
because someone is pretty?

411
00:52:50,701 --> 00:52:53,968
- It was not what I said.
- Do not be silly then!

412
00:52:56,925 --> 00:52:58,762
- What did she say exactly?

413
00:52:59,894 --> 00:53:01,961
- Nothing. It explains nothing.

414
00:53:04,466 --> 00:53:08,866
The police told me, I needed time
to understand what she had done.

415
00:53:09,313 --> 00:53:12,646
- At least with the death of this man,
it is over.

416
00:53:13,793 --> 00:53:15,839
- What if he had not died?

417
00:53:16,832 --> 00:53:19,765
She would have continued.
Do you understand?

418
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:24,301
- I think she needs more authority.
Maybe you should send her to her father.

419
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:27,451
- Not with this father.
We have enough problems.

420
00:53:27,451 --> 00:53:31,117
- Okay, listen, tomorrow the police wants
to hear your statement ...

421
00:53:31,117 --> 00:53:34,385
and you have to go see a psychologist and
then you will decide what to do with her.

422
00:53:34,385 --> 00:53:35,944
No use in dramatising.

423
00:53:35,945 --> 00:53:38,278
-Do you think I am dramatising now?

424
00:53:38,527 --> 00:53:41,322
Do you realise, what she has done?
- Yes, of course.

425
00:53:41,322 --> 00:53:44,122
We must be firm,
watch her and punish her.

426
00:53:44,538 --> 00:53:46,600
No more computer, mobile phone,
no going out.

427
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,519
And your son,
does he understand?

428
00:53:48,519 --> 00:53:53,652
- I imagine. He was there when the police came
and heard me speaking to Muna.

429
00:53:54,442 --> 00:53:56,375
I will talk to him tomorrow .

430
00:53:57,034 --> 00:53:58,820
- Very well.

431
00:54:02,582 --> 00:54:05,449
- Really, do you think I am
about that now?

432
00:54:05,623 --> 00:54:08,623
- What is it? I thought, you just need a hug.

433
00:54:09,069 --> 00:54:10,724
- I am sorry.

434
00:54:14,014 --> 00:54:18,347
- A man followed me in front of high school
and offered me money.

435
00:54:18,647 --> 00:54:20,500
- Did you take it?
- No.

436
00:54:22,107 --> 00:54:25,794
I said, I would think about that and he left me
his number, in case I am changing my mind.

437
00:54:25,794 --> 00:54:28,391
- 06 23 21 46 37.

438
00:54:32,611 --> 00:54:35,082
- After how long did you call?

439
00:54:35,533 --> 00:54:37,653
- A week later.

440
00:54:38,193 --> 00:54:40,193
- Where did you meet together?

441
00:54:41,032 --> 00:54:44,232
- At the Intercontinental Hotel,
near the Opera.

442
00:54:45,331 --> 00:54:46,831
- Did you like it?

443
00:54:49,059 --> 00:54:50,578
- Not right away.

444
00:54:52,353 --> 00:54:55,648
At first I was disgusted, but
then I wanted to do it again.

445
00:54:55,648 --> 00:54:57,796
- Why did you do it again?

446
00:54:59,301 --> 00:55:03,168
- I saw a documentary on TV
about students who need money.

447
00:55:07,091 --> 00:55:10,105
I bought another phone
and so it began.

448
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:17,160
- Do you intend to follow that again?
- I do not know.

449
00:55:17,655 --> 00:55:21,046
It was just an experience.
- An experience that can be very dangerous .

450
00:55:21,046 --> 00:55:24,547
You never know who you will be with.
There is no one to take care of or defend you.

451
00:55:24,547 --> 00:55:26,865
Being a minor,
you are an easy prey.

452
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:31,096
Most prostitutes are assaulted
or raped, left alone to murderers.

453
00:55:31,096 --> 00:55:34,696
It is easy money.,Soon you can
be in a vicious circle.

454
00:55:36,512 --> 00:55:38,932
Talking about G. Ferrière.

455
00:55:38,933 --> 00:55:41,970
Had you noticed anything in particular,
did you know he had heart problems?

456
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:45,217
- No. He was taking drugs.

457
00:55:45,516 --> 00:55:47,187
- What drugs?

458
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:49,361
- I do not know. Viagra.

459
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:53,338
- Did you practice sadomasochistic games,
degenerated erotic games ...

460
00:55:53,338 --> 00:55:55,699
strangulation, wives,
violence ...?

461
00:55:55,877 --> 00:55:57,377
- No, it was normal.

462
00:55:59,451 --> 00:56:04,918
- Why did you run away without telling anyone?
- I ran. I did not know what to do.

463
00:56:06,553 --> 00:56:10,170
- Seeing how he was dead,
how long after that did you leave?

464
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:12,492
- I do not know. I was in shock. He was dead.

465
00:56:12,492 --> 00:56:15,164
- Are you sure he was dead?
- Yes.

466
00:56:16,714 --> 00:56:21,300
- Have you ever seen a dead man before?
- No, or yes, my grandfather, but it was different.

467
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:25,880
- Did you take the money?
- Yes, what we agreed.

468
00:56:27,816 --> 00:56:33,016
- Does all the money stay with me?
- No, being a minor it goes to your mother.

469
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:36,470
- Did you finish your yoghurt?
- Yes.

470
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:39,203
- Go brush your teeth before bed!
- Okay.

471
00:56:41,994 --> 00:56:46,394
- I am going to let you alone.
- No, please stay, it is important.

472
00:56:51,651 --> 00:56:54,242
I went to the hospital and ...

473
00:56:54,243 --> 00:56:57,376
someone advised me very good.
- I am not sick .

474
00:56:57,858 --> 00:56:59,924
- I did not say that, but I think you need
to talk to someone.

475
00:56:59,924 --> 00:57:00,918
- I do not want to talk.

476
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:03,824
- No alternatives, Isabelle.
With what happened, you have to follow a treatment ...

477
00:57:03,824 --> 00:57:04,812
psychotherapy.

478
00:57:04,812 --> 00:57:06,317
- I do not. You can not force me.

479
00:57:06,317 --> 00:57:07,802
- Listen to me!

480
00:57:07,802 --> 00:57:13,002
Either that or you will be sent to
a psychiatric hospital. Do you prefer that?

481
00:57:15,531 --> 00:57:19,731
- It is for you, Isabelle.
It can not hurt you, why not trying?

482
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,482
- And what about my money?

483
00:57:25,468 --> 00:57:28,942
- I thought to give it to a charity.

484
00:57:28,943 --> 00:57:33,274
Something for the reintegration of prostitutes
- Yes , that is fine.

485
00:57:33,274 --> 00:57:34,774
- Bastards.

486
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:54,013
- For me , it was a surprise,
I did not understand and ...

487
00:57:54,013 --> 00:57:55,974
still do not understand.

488
00:57:56,617 --> 00:57:59,315
Isabelle always had what she wanted.

489
00:57:59,787 --> 00:58:03,654
I make my life very well,
providing good for the children.

490
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:08,287
I give her money when she needs it
to buy whatever she wants to.

491
00:58:08,567 --> 00:58:11,387
- Do you need money?
- No.

492
00:58:11,997 --> 00:58:15,283
- Why charge then?
- Did you want to know your price?

493
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:17,339
- No, that way it was simpler, clearer.

494
00:58:17,339 --> 00:58:19,872
- How can you say this?
- Let me talk!

495
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:24,664
- Were they older men?
- Exactly.

496
00:58:25,167 --> 00:58:27,234
- About the age of your father?

497
00:58:27,572 --> 00:58:29,072
- Or yours.

498
00:58:33,059 --> 00:58:36,037
- Can you tell me about him?
- There is nothing to say.

499
00:58:36,037 --> 00:58:40,074
- What I can tell, we split up 7 years ago.

500
00:58:40,641 --> 00:58:43,579
He works hard and lives in Italy.
Hhe remarried four years ago ...

501
00:58:43,579 --> 00:58:44,966
and have got a son one year ago.

502
00:58:44,966 --> 00:58:47,274
Isabelle and her brother ...
they see him during the holidays.

503
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:50,098
- Do you get along with him?
- Normal, it is my father.

504
00:58:50,098 --> 00:58:51,859
- Do you miss him?
- No.

505
00:58:52,367 --> 00:58:55,821
- You know youh have the right to resent or be sad?

506
00:58:57,041 --> 00:59:01,546
Do you get a pension?
- Yes, everything is clear between us.

507
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:07,069
- And you, Isabelle, does he give you money?
- Yes, for my birthday, Christmas.

508
00:59:07,069 --> 00:59:08,503
- Enough?
- Yes.

509
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:13,849
- How much?
- 500 Euros for Christmas and my birthday.

510
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:17,261
- This year, he forgot.
- No, he sent me a check.

511
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,185
- You did not tell me.

512
00:59:19,747 --> 00:59:24,631
Well, Isabelle, can we now
define when we meet together?

513
00:59:25,212 --> 00:59:28,079
Are you fine about coming here
once a week?

514
00:59:29,361 --> 00:59:32,117
- How much?
- 70 Euros.

515
00:59:32,118 --> 00:59:35,840
- No more?
- It is my rate.

516
00:59:40,290 --> 00:59:43,838
- Well, I can pay with the money I earned.

517
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:46,439
- That does not sound like a good idea.

518
00:59:46,856 --> 00:59:48,627
Well, I do not know. No?

519
00:59:52,336 --> 00:59:56,645
- Isabelle is right. it is her money, she earned it.

520
01:00:02,055 --> 01:00:04,188
- Hello Isabelle.
- Hello Peter.

521
01:00:06,123 --> 01:00:09,230
Hi kids.
Hello Lucie.

522
01:00:12,569 --> 01:00:15,871
- And?
- Everything seems ok, as usual.

523
01:00:16,253 --> 01:00:17,753
How are you liking it?

524
01:00:18,264 --> 01:00:20,963
- ... the mosquito, pork ...
- Hello, Isabelle.

525
01:00:20,963 --> 01:00:25,430
- Hello Vero, are you okay?
- Still tired, she grows teeth, Sophie.

526
01:00:25,544 --> 01:00:30,175
- Do I give her the bottle if he wakes up?
- Yes, I left everything in the kitchen.

527
01:00:30,175 --> 01:00:31,514
- Bye, mum.
- Goodbye, my love.

528
01:00:31,514 --> 01:00:33,014
Just warm ...

529
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:36,199
but should not wake her
before we get there.

530
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:37,640
- Do you want to see my drawings?

531
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:41,344
- Do not bother Isabelle too much
and within an hour, everyone to sleep!

532
01:00:41,344 --> 01:00:44,921
- If you want to eat something, help yourself with the fridge!
- Okay.

533
01:00:44,921 --> 01:00:47,299
- Good luck. No going back now, anyway.

534
01:00:47,299 --> 01:00:49,032
-Thanks, have a good time.

535
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,180
- Good night.

536
01:01:55,684 --> 01:01:58,147
- Good night, I fell asleep .

537
01:01:58,638 --> 01:02:01,886
- Everything alright?
- Yes, fine.

538
01:02:02,395 --> 01:02:06,204
- Is Sophie awake?
- No, I went to see her and she slept deeply.

539
01:02:06,204 --> 01:02:10,537
- How good. Is now 1 am, she arrived at 7 pm,
so it is six hours.

540
01:02:12,606 --> 01:02:15,606
Peter? You have change? I have only 50 Euros.

541
01:02:16,231 --> 01:02:18,304
- How much?
- 10 Euro.

542
01:02:20,721 --> 01:02:22,195
- Here.
- Thank you.

543
01:02:22,195 --> 01:02:24,795
- Can I take you home, Isabelle?
- Yes.

544
01:02:28,677 --> 01:02:30,794
- Peter, wait!
- What?

545
01:02:31,246 --> 01:02:32,913
- I am going to take her.

546
01:02:33,065 --> 01:02:35,005
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

547
01:02:40,838 --> 01:02:46,169
- Why you did not want Peter to take me?
- I told you: He has to get up early.

548
01:02:46,608 --> 01:02:49,430
- Do you not trust me?
- Of course.

549
01:02:49,971 --> 01:02:54,104
- So you do not trust him?
- What are you presuming, Isabelle?

550
01:02:54,116 --> 01:02:56,849
- I know that my mum told you everything.

551
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:59,534
In any case, I am not the danger.

552
01:03:00,738 --> 01:03:02,338
- What are you implying?

553
01:03:12,743 --> 01:03:16,207
- Good evening.
- Hey, are you okay?

554
01:03:16,414 --> 01:03:18,934
- Yes, I gained 60 Euros.
- What?

555
01:03:19,375 --> 01:03:21,552
- As a nanny.

556
01:03:22,399 --> 01:03:24,131
- Very funny.

557
01:03:24,684 --> 01:03:28,760
- What are you watching?
- Nothing in particular, just nonsense.

558
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:31,344
- You have been waiting for me?
- No.

559
01:03:33,473 --> 01:03:38,454
- Mum is sleeping?
- Yes, she is very tired. It is not easy for her.

560
01:03:38,896 --> 01:03:42,985
- Why?
- Do not play innocent, Isabelle! You know why.

561
01:03:45,527 --> 01:03:48,154
- What is it?
- Nothing. You make me laughing.

562
01:03:48,154 --> 01:03:50,124
- What is there to laugh?

563
01:03:51,211 --> 01:03:55,245
- You remind me of a guy I went to bed.
A customer .

564
01:04:08,071 --> 01:04:11,604
- What are you playing, Isabelle?
- I am not playing.

565
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:15,556
- You should be careful with your mum. She is fragile.

566
01:04:15,556 --> 01:04:18,482
You need to talk. She needs to understand.

567
01:04:19,104 --> 01:04:23,006
- It is hard for your mother, you know?
- I have nothing to say , it is my life.

568
01:04:23,006 --> 01:04:26,293
- Make an effort, be nice! She is very shocked.

569
01:04:27,235 --> 01:04:30,168
- And you, are you shocked?
- Yeah, me, too.

570
01:04:30,647 --> 01:04:32,532
But I do not care, I am not your father.

571
01:04:32,532 --> 01:04:34,865
- But precisely, what do you think?

572
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,133
- I think you are in a phase of adolescence,
where you want to experience ...

573
01:04:41,301 --> 01:04:43,840
know your limits, transgress.

574
01:04:44,355 --> 01:04:48,796
- Did you sleep with a hooker before?
- I do not think, that is any of your business.

575
01:04:48,796 --> 01:04:51,500
- Come on, tell me, I will not say anything to mum!

576
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:53,000
- What are you doing?

577
01:04:56,338 --> 01:04:58,071
- Nothing. we are talking.

578
01:04:58,697 --> 01:05:00,490
- Go to bed at once!

579
01:05:11,435 --> 01:05:14,902
- I am sorry, but ...
- I know, do not say anything!

580
01:05:16,425 --> 01:05:19,493
- You could send her to a boarding school, right?

581
01:05:19,493 --> 01:05:21,425
- I do not know.

582
01:05:21,998 --> 01:05:25,531
- You are accepting her vice.
- What are you saying ?

583
01:05:25,709 --> 01:05:31,058
- I was watching you.
- You are exaggerating. She just wants to provoke.

584
01:05:33,141 --> 01:05:35,741
- It is my daughter and it disgusts me.

585
01:05:35,889 --> 01:05:38,493
- You have to talk calmly.

586
01:05:40,625 --> 01:05:42,370
Where are you going?

587
01:05:45,687 --> 01:05:49,087
- What are you doing ?
Did you see what time it is?

588
01:05:51,806 --> 01:05:54,879
- I want to propose something.
- What?

589
01:06:05,365 --> 01:06:07,866
What do you think the two of us
go to London for a weekend?

590
01:06:07,866 --> 01:06:12,189
For shopping. Peter's parents have an apartment there.

591
01:06:12,190 --> 01:06:15,229
We could go see a musical.

592
01:06:17,067 --> 01:06:18,823
I do not like musicals.

593
01:06:21,954 --> 01:06:24,754
What did we do to make you act like this ?

594
01:06:25,166 --> 01:06:30,786
I do not understand. Before you told me everything.

595
01:06:31,413 --> 01:06:33,613
- Is it Patrick?
- Of course not.

596
01:06:36,294 --> 01:06:38,221
- What did the psychologist say?
- Nonsense.

597
01:06:38,221 --> 01:06:42,021
- Is it bad?
- I do not want to talk about this with you.

598
01:06:42,731 --> 01:06:46,001
- But I can understand. I also had your age
and did stupid things.

599
01:06:46,001 --> 01:06:48,178
- You, too? You were a whore?

600
01:06:56,875 --> 01:07:01,675
I am your mother, Isabelle. It is normal to worry
and try to fix things.

601
01:07:04,493 --> 01:07:07,093
- I know what is between you and Peter.

602
01:07:08,279 --> 01:07:10,212
- What are you talking about?

603
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:13,560
- You have sex.

604
01:07:16,941 --> 01:07:20,366
- If I say yes, what would that change?

605
01:07:20,993 --> 01:07:23,618
- That you trust me.

606
01:07:24,363 --> 01:07:28,063
- You scare me, Isabelle.

607
01:07:40,603 --> 01:07:43,470
- What I liked was to arrange appointments.

608
01:07:44,505 --> 01:07:48,055
Chat online, talking on the phone.

609
01:07:48,872 --> 01:07:53,807
Listen to the voices, imagine things.

610
01:07:56,221 --> 01:07:59,452
Then go, discover the hotel ...

611
01:08:00,353 --> 01:08:02,892
not knowing who I would find.

612
01:08:04,741 --> 01:08:06,241
It was like a game.

613
01:08:06,928 --> 01:08:09,225
A game ... dangerous.

614
01:08:10,186 --> 01:08:13,490
No. Or maybe a little.

615
01:08:14,224 --> 01:08:17,706
At the time I almost felt nothing.

616
01:08:19,605 --> 01:08:22,800
But then, when remembered at home ...

617
01:08:23,786 --> 01:08:25,286
or in high school ...

618
01:08:26,354 --> 01:08:28,725
wanted to do it again.

619
01:08:29,945 --> 01:08:31,642
With another one.

620
01:08:31,643 --> 01:08:33,976
- What about the death of this man?

621
01:08:36,082 --> 01:08:37,928
- Yes.

622
01:08:40,125 --> 01:08:41,966
Georges.

623
01:08:43,091 --> 01:08:47,335
- Did you see him several times, that Georges?
- Yes.

624
01:08:48,295 --> 01:08:50,295
- Why?

625
01:08:54,018 --> 01:08:56,435
- He was friendly.

626
01:08:58,934 --> 01:09:00,801
With him it was more tender.

627
01:09:04,825 --> 01:09:07,335
Not asking much, just ...

628
01:09:10,026 --> 01:09:15,034
caress ... looking at me.

629
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:24,111
Except the last time.
He asked me to get up ...

630
01:09:26,326 --> 01:09:28,077
and died.

631
01:09:36,631 --> 01:09:38,581
After this, I had no desire.

632
01:09:43,055 --> 01:09:44,860
I felt dirty.

633
01:09:45,752 --> 01:09:48,510
- Dirty? Why?

634
01:09:52,555 --> 01:09:54,064
- Because killing him.

635
01:10:23,237 --> 01:10:26,225
What is it?
- I slept with Etienne.

636
01:10:26,226 --> 01:10:29,250
- That is great, it is what you wanted.
- No.

637
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:33,842
I did very badly.
Now he is ignoring me.

638
01:10:34,451 --> 01:10:37,311
I saw him, acting as if nothing had happened.

639
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:40,937
- What was wrong?
- It lasted 3 minutes.

640
01:10:41,788 --> 01:10:43,989
I felt nothing, even when he had ejaculated.

641
01:10:43,989 --> 01:10:48,335
- Do not worry! At least, you did it.
Something less to do.

642
01:10:50,689 --> 01:10:52,624
Do not cry.

643
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:56,669
It is always like the first time.

644
01:10:56,681 --> 01:10:59,548
- What do you know? You are still a virgin!

645
01:11:00,586 --> 01:11:03,186
- Did you sleep with your lawyer?
- No.

646
01:11:03,393 --> 01:11:07,860
I read many stories on the subject
and it is always the same story.

647
01:11:12,455 --> 01:11:16,388
Etienne? Are you coming to the party at
Benoit on Saturday?

648
01:11:17,733 --> 01:11:20,441
If you want, I will go with you.

649
01:11:22,670 --> 01:11:24,603
- Thank you.
- It is alright.

650
01:11:28,485 --> 01:11:31,978
- Mum agrees?
- Yes, she talked to my psychologist.

651
01:11:32,708 --> 01:11:35,375
- Who will come?
- Students in my class.

652
01:11:38,584 --> 01:11:40,391
Are not I too ugly ?

653
01:11:41,431 --> 01:11:42,931
- No, it is fine.

654
01:11:43,609 --> 01:11:45,908
Are not you going to make up?
- What do you think?

655
01:11:45,908 --> 01:11:47,641
- Yes, a little, at least.

656
01:11:47,738 --> 01:11:50,636
There is a girl in my course.
You know what she does?

657
01:11:50,636 --> 01:11:53,114
- What?
- She gives kisses with tongue for five Euros.

658
01:11:53,114 --> 01:11:54,614
- Not expensive.

659
01:11:56,477 --> 01:11:59,744
- Did you pay?
- Are you crazy? I am not in need.

660
01:12:00,248 --> 01:12:03,248
- It is not shameful. It is good to practice.

661
01:12:06,161 --> 01:12:09,228
- Do you like my friend Marco?
- Yes, I think.

662
01:12:10,693 --> 01:12:14,782
- I would like to sleep with a girl.
- Forget it! You do not have enough money.

663
01:12:14,782 --> 01:12:16,282
- Did you not quit?

664
01:12:18,161 --> 01:12:19,998
- Sure. I am kidding.

665
01:12:25,314 --> 01:12:27,842
It is for me. Do not say anything!

666
01:12:28,875 --> 01:12:30,393
- Hello.
- Hello.

667
01:12:31,413 --> 01:12:32,613
- Ready?

668
01:12:32,613 --> 01:12:35,078
- Good evening, Claire.
- Good evening, Madame.

669
01:12:35,078 --> 01:12:37,286
- Everything alright with you?
- Yes, and you?

670
01:12:37,286 --> 01:12:39,566
- Do not come too late
and call me if you have a problem!

671
01:12:39,566 --> 01:12:40,922
- Yes, I call.

672
01:12:40,922 --> 01:12:42,743
- Thanks, have a good time, girls.
- Good evening.

673
01:12:42,743 --> 01:12:44,476
- Goodbye, girl, have fun!

674
01:12:48,141 --> 01:12:52,208
Do not worry, everything will be fine,
you have to trust her!

675
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:15,160
- Hello.

676
01:13:16,616 --> 01:13:18,220
- How are you doing?
- Well, and you?

677
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:21,773
- Well, where are you going?
- I am walking.

678
01:14:24,204 --> 01:14:26,802
- Hello, Isabelle.
- Hello.

679
01:14:27,498 --> 01:14:30,662
- Too hot, too?
- No, I needed some air.

680
01:14:31,562 --> 01:14:34,669
- Yeah, me too.
I think, I took too much.

681
01:14:38,026 --> 01:14:40,033
I did not know you were coming.
You do not usually go to parties.

682
01:14:40,033 --> 01:14:42,803
- Claire insisted.
- Good.

683
01:14:46,684 --> 01:14:49,484
Do you want a cigarette?
- Yes, thank you.

684
01:15:06,625 --> 01:15:11,092
- If I say I want to kiss you ...
are you going to send me to hell?

685
01:15:14,524 --> 01:15:16,146
Sorry, I am very silly.

686
01:15:20,037 --> 01:15:22,071
- Okay, kiss!

687
01:15:24,436 --> 01:15:27,114
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

688
01:15:59,156 --> 01:16:01,223
- Isabelle, what are you doing?

689
01:16:01,978 --> 01:16:03,533
Come, come!

690
01:16:24,807 --> 01:16:28,094
<i> I 'm alone in my room ... </i>

691
01:16:31,326 --> 01:16:35,815
<i> dreaming of him to come ... </i>

692
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:42,960
<i> to take me a day of childhood ... </i>

693
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:50,153
<i> and who would leave me ... </i>

694
01:16:51,783 --> 01:16:54,278
<i>away! </i>

695
01:16:56,827 --> 01:17:00,726
<i> If I had to have described ... </i>

696
01:17:03,944 --> 01:17:08,548
<i> I would undoubtedly wrong . </i>

697
01:17:11,825 --> 01:17:15,424
<i> But I already liked his smile ... </i>

698
01:17:18,584 --> 01:17:22,569
<i> have known before . </i>

699
01:17:39,985 --> 01:17:41,652
- Do you want to go home?

700
01:17:45,780 --> 01:17:47,736
- Not the first night.

701
01:17:58,239 --> 01:18:02,742
<i> When I saw him ,
It was a bit like that ... </i>

702
01:18:05,379 --> 01:18:10,172
<i> had nothing
anyone. </i>

703
01:18:12,443 --> 01:18:17,143
<i> But I knew he was ... </i>

704
01:18:21,101 --> 01:18:25,319
<i> and none other. </i>

705
01:18:27,782 --> 01:18:29,783
- Spring -

706
01:18:34,032 --> 01:18:35,699
- Lunch is ready, Victor.

707
01:18:37,668 --> 01:18:39,168
Shit.

708
01:18:49,922 --> 01:18:52,522
- Are they coming?
- Yes, we can begin.

709
01:18:53,932 --> 01:18:58,065
- You know it is the first day of summer today?
- Yes, I know.

710
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:24,467
Sorry, I do not know what is wrong with me.

711
01:19:36,106 --> 01:19:39,239
- What are you doing?
- Now let me handle this!

712
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:17,667
- Good morning.
- Hi Alex, come sit!

713
01:20:18,271 --> 01:20:21,052
- Isabelle is coming?
- Yes, she is showering.

714
01:20:21,052 --> 01:20:23,719
- And you, do not you shower?
- Not yet.

715
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:26,300
- Do you bother?
- No, it smells.

716
01:20:26,937 --> 01:20:30,270
- What are you drinking? Coffee?
- Yes, thank you.

717
01:20:30,447 --> 01:20:34,377
- How was the concert last night?
- Great, I love this band.

718
01:20:34,377 --> 01:20:36,495
There was a party afterwards,
but we were not going to.

719
01:20:36,495 --> 01:20:38,819
- Why?
- Because Isabelle wanted to return early.

720
01:20:38,819 --> 01:20:41,131
- I am not guilty.
- I know.

721
01:20:41,701 --> 01:20:44,968
She is too serious, just thinking about studying.

722
01:21:01,763 --> 01:21:05,963
- Isabelle, what are you doing?
Come, get yourself a croissant!

723
01:21:07,271 --> 01:21:09,970
- Where will we go for vacation this summer?

724
01:21:09,970 --> 01:21:11,989
- It is a sensitive issue.

725
01:21:12,537 --> 01:21:16,137
- At Clos !
- Me , I would like to go back to Al Clos.

726
01:21:16,175 --> 01:21:19,084
At least, a couple of weeks.

727
01:21:21,631 --> 01:21:23,955
- What are you reading?
- Lesmois.

728
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:28,296
- What is it?
- Now you need to be quiet, I want to read in peace .

729
01:21:28,296 --> 01:21:31,229
- Do you not want to quit?
- Yes, but later.

730
01:21:34,599 --> 01:21:36,266
- So you are ignoring me?

731
01:21:40,858 --> 01:21:42,761
- It is over, Alex.

732
01:21:43,659 --> 01:21:45,389
- What? What ended?
- We.

733
01:21:46,012 --> 01:21:47,734
- Why do you say this?

734
01:21:52,251 --> 01:21:54,651
- Because I am not in love with you.

735
01:21:57,636 --> 01:21:59,303
- Why, and what did I do?

736
01:21:59,876 --> 01:22:03,342
- Nothing. I am. It is so.

737
01:22:11,095 --> 01:22:13,848
- We are good together.
We had fun, right?

738
01:22:13,848 --> 01:22:15,348
- Yes.

739
01:22:16,039 --> 01:22:19,135
- Then? Give us time!

740
01:22:20,426 --> 01:22:22,559
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

741
01:22:23,141 --> 01:22:25,009
- Want to play PlayStation?

742
01:22:26,308 --> 01:22:27,808
- Go!

743
01:22:36,408 --> 01:22:38,953
- Where is Alex?
- He left.

744
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:46,993
- Why was he not saying goodbye to me when leaving?
- I do not know. He looked sad.

745
01:22:47,827 --> 01:22:51,494
- What did he say ?
- Nothing. He did not want to play.

746
01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:54,122
- Did you tell him?
- No.

747
01:22:54,838 --> 01:22:57,105
- Perhaps he suspects?
- Not that.

748
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:06,207
- Good morning, Miss.
- Good morning.

749
01:24:17,676 --> 01:24:22,343
- Good morning, Miss. Do you want a drink?
- I am waiting for someone.

750
01:24:42,132 --> 01:24:44,824
- Good morning.
- Can I sit?

751
01:24:44,825 --> 01:24:46,325
- Yes.

752
01:24:54,478 --> 01:24:57,924
- What do you take?
- Like you.

753
01:24:58,075 --> 01:24:59,805
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

754
01:25:00,350 --> 01:25:03,066
- Please, two whiskey.

755
01:25:07,587 --> 01:25:10,520
- I found your number in one of his agendas.

756
01:25:10,783 --> 01:25:13,758
- Lea.
- It was my nickname.

757
01:25:13,801 --> 01:25:15,301
- I know.

758
01:25:16,890 --> 01:25:18,756
- I wanted to meet.

759
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:24,490
Learning how the last girl was
to see my husband before he dies.

760
01:25:24,584 --> 01:25:26,365
- Sorry.

761
01:25:26,690 --> 01:25:30,023
You do not have to reproach yourself.
He was sick.

762
01:25:31,441 --> 01:25:34,380
Die making love is a cute death, right?

763
01:25:46,811 --> 01:25:50,641
You are young. And very pretty.

764
01:25:51,812 --> 01:25:53,312
- Thank you.

765
01:25:54,783 --> 01:25:58,390
- Too pretty. Did not imagine that.

766
01:25:58,531 --> 01:26:01,938
- Neither imagined you so.
- Oh, yeah?

767
01:26:02,873 --> 01:26:05,839
- Have you talked about me?
- No, never.

768
01:26:16,957 --> 01:26:20,181
- How old are you really ?
- 17 years.

769
01:26:20,843 --> 01:26:24,769
- 17. What a lovely age.

770
01:26:25,541 --> 01:26:29,129
I also was 17 when I met Georges.

771
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:33,275
I knew he saw other women.

772
01:26:33,975 --> 01:26:36,369
At first it hurt, but ...

773
01:26:38,555 --> 01:26:41,075
finally I settled me.

774
01:26:43,025 --> 01:26:45,910
I was always melancholic.

775
01:26:51,107 --> 01:26:53,987
If I had been brave, less shy ...

776
01:26:56,243 --> 01:26:59,353
I wish men paid to make love to me.

777
01:27:03,061 --> 01:27:04,787
But I never dared.

778
01:27:07,124 --> 01:27:09,398
I thought at times. As a fantasy.

779
01:27:13,390 --> 01:27:16,861
Now, I am older, too. I would have to pay.

780
01:27:27,702 --> 01:27:30,903
You did it in room 6095, right?

781
01:27:32,170 --> 01:27:33,670
- Yes.

782
01:27:34,287 --> 01:27:39,391
- It is booked. And I would like you to accompany me.

783
01:27:41,953 --> 01:27:45,714
300 Euros. That was your rate?

784
01:28:13,438 --> 01:28:16,007
So, it was here?
- Yes.

785
01:28:20,338 --> 01:28:22,298
- I needed to see this room.

786
01:28:31,221 --> 01:28:32,833
We love to the end.

787
01:28:34,139 --> 01:28:36,272
Always with the same tenderness.

788
01:28:36,715 --> 01:28:38,915
- You want to talk or undress me?

789
01:28:42,578 --> 01:28:46,129
- It will not be necessary.
- Sorry.

790
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:51,500
- Come to bed with me!

791
01:29:11,904 --> 01:29:14,104
- I also needed to see this room.

792
01:29:20,641 --> 01:29:22,141
Thank you.
