00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,880
Well, you don't say. Sorry, I'm not going with you.
真有这事 我不送你去了

520
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:27,900
Oh, Dev will pick those up later.
用完了交给德弗林

521
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:30,520
Try to memorise the names of all the people you see there tonight.
记住你今晚见到的所有人的名字

522
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:31,490
The men, I mean.
是男的

523
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:34,000
And get their nationalities. That's very important.
还有他们的国籍, 这点很重要

524
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:36,220
You mean the Germans? That won't be difficult for me.
要是德国人, 我听得出口音

525
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:40,350
I suggest you don't ask any questions. Just use your eyes and ears.
我建议你不要多问 你要多听, 多看

526
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:43,460
They're a keen and desperate bunch. Don't underestimate them.
这帮亡命徒很精明, 别小看他们

527
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:46,160
Thanks for your instructions. Good evening.

By the way, unless you have something very urgent to report...
还有一件事 除非有非常紧急的情况要报告

529
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:52,350
I suggest you two keep shy of each other for the next few days.
我们建议你们最近几天不要见面

530
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,470
Just in case Sebastian's people want to check on you after your visit.
这是怕你去了以后, 他们会调查你

531
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:56,830
- I understand. - Good luck.
- 我懂了 - 就这些了, 祝你成功!

532
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,120
- Goodnight. - Goodnight.
- 再见! - 再见!

Good evening. I'm Miss Huberman,  would you tell Mr. Sebastian I'm here?

536
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,150
Not at all.
没关系

537
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:40,030
You resemble your father very much. I'm Alex's mother.

538
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:41,890
I knew when I saw you.
一见就认出来了

You're very kind.

541
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:50,550
We thought unusual that you did not testify at your father's trial.
你父亲受审的时候你没作证 他不寻常啊

542

He didn't want me to.

He refused to let his lawyers call me on the stand.

544
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,230
I wonder why?

564
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:11,050
You mustn't bore Miss Huberman with discourses on science.
亚历克斯, 你不要谈科学 会让休伯曼小姐厌烦

570
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,130
A few weeks ago. It seems ages.
几个星期以前, 就好像很久

571
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:33,980
Travel does not mean anything anymore, it goes so swiftly.
现在的旅行就是快捷

572
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:37,370
One has the feeling of not going anywhere.
去哪儿都那么方便

573
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,510
I suppose we can expect the rocket ships...
我猜想我们今后可以

574
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,550
to be carrying us across the oceans very soon.
坐更快的火箭跨过大洋

575
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,250
We can expect many strange things.
你总有奇思妙想

576
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:48,220
- Did you see a good movie, Eric? - No, I was disappointed.
- 下午的电影好吗? - 不, 太失望了

577
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,740
It must have been a comedy. Eric loves to go to the movies to cry.
一定是个喜剧 艾瑞克就爱到电影院哭鼻子

578
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:53,480
He's very sentimental.
他心肠很软

579
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:18,540
I'm afraid, gentlemen, that something must be done about Emil.
我看对伊米尔得想想办法了

580
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:20,320
I don't know.
怎么说呢

581
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:24,520
It was an understandable slip: the man was tired.
这是个不应该的疏忽 他过于疲劳了

582
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:27,880
No, it's a very dangerous slip.
这是个很危险的疏忽

583
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,860
It's not the first one. There have been several other lapses.
这可不是第一次 已经试过好几次了

584
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:33,080
There'll be more, if we permit it.
要是不管, 还会这样

585
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,630
That's bad, that's very bad!
这不好, 很不好

586
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:39,150
I think, gentlemen, you can leave it to me to find some way.
我看诸位, 把这事交给我吧

587
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,350
When you drive up to Metropolis,  the road winds quite a bit.
我有办法, 往山顶去的那条路弯弯曲曲

588
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:46,630
It is very high. There are some very awkward turns.
山也很高 而且有很多急转弯

589
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:50,070
I'm sure I'll not have any difficulty...
我要搭伊米尔的车

590
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:52,120
in getting Emil to give me a lift in his car.
...没什么困难

591
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:54,140
It's quite a trick to jump clear.
但是要跳车, 就不那么简单了

592
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:57,660
I'll just have to be careful,  that is all.
我加点小心就是了

593
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,740
Turned my ankle the last time.
刚才的事不会再发生了

594
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:15,480
Madame says will you join the others or will you take your coffee in here?
夫人问, 你们是跟客人一起喝咖啡 还是在这喝呢?

595
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:18,150
I think we'll take coffee in here,  Emil.
我们就在这儿喝

596
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:24,780
I'm very sorry gentlemen,  to make such an exhibition.
很抱歉, 这样当众出丑

597
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:26,720
Oh, nonsense!
没别的事

598
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:28,370
We all have nerves!
你有点紧张了

599
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:30,760
You've been overworking.
你太累了

600
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:32,580
Don't you think so, Rothman?
你看对不对?

601
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,000
You need a rest.
你需要休息

602
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:37,110
Your health is very important to us.
健康非常重要

603
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:40,300
That's very considerate. I am very tired.
你想的真周到, 我是很疲劳了

604
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:45,960
Now, I think perhaps if you'll make my pardon to the ladies, Alex...
所以, 现在... 我看也许... 你替我跟那些女人们告辞, 亚历克斯

605
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:48,260
for my leaving so early, then I go...
我没能奉陪, 很抱歉

606
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:51,380
I think maybe, Emil, it would be better if I came with you.
伊尔米, 还是我和你一起去的好

607
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:54,690
If you try to drive yourself all the way up to Metropolis...
刚吃完了饭, 又是这么远的路

608
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,180
it might be too much for you.
一个人开车会受不了的

609
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,490
I shall drive you.
我来给你开车

610
00:45:59,060 --> 00:45:59,900
No!
不!

611
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:03,980
It'd be too much for you all that way. That's too much to ask.
这么远的路你恐怕也受不了 怎么可能你驾...

612
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:06,250
Nonsense, I'd love to go!
哪儿的话, 我愿意去

613
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:07,530
Come on, Emil.
走吧, 伊米尔

614
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,770
Goodnight, gentlemen.

615

Goodnight, Alex.

616
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:13,970
I hope you feel better in the morning, Emil.
明天你就会恢复疲劳了, 伊米尔

617
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:19,370

And please tell your mother from me that the desert was superb.
告诉你母亲, 特别是那道点心太好了

621
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:41,030
Miss Huberman has been gone a long time.
休伯曼小姐去了好半天了

622
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,740
Is it necessary for you to address Alicia as Miss Huberman?
为什么老是叫艾丽茜娅做休伯曼小姐呢?

623
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:46,200
I do wish you'd be a little more cordial to her.
我希望你不要对她太见外了

624
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:48,630
Really? I thought I was behaving very well.

Has she been complaining about me?

- No, no. - I'm grateful.

627

You might smile at her.
你要对她随和些

628
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:58,010
Wouldn't it be a little too much if we both grinned at her like idiots?
要是我们俩都像客人 一样对待她那不太过份吗?

629
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:00,430
Please, mother,  I want to enjoy myself.
好了, 妈妈, 让我好好看看

Is it so boring to sit with me alone?

00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,850
Not at all, not at all.

他们母子俩不会看见我们

638
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:29,150

- 听说过安德森博士吗? - 没有

Didn't like the vintage?

- Was there? - No, it was wine. We drank it.

Nothing important.

- 知道我在干什么就好 - 是吗?

You could have stopped me with one word, but you threw me at him.

I threw you at nobody.
我没有这么做

667

Didn't you tell me to go ahead?
不都是你告诉我的吗?

668

A man doesn't tell a woman what to do. She tells herself.
男人不能告诉女人去做什么, 除了她自己

that a woman like you could ever change her spots.

Oh, you're rotten!

我之所以没阻止你, 答案在你自己

673
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,830
- I see, some kind of love test. - That's right.

You never believed in me anyway...
你从来就没相信过我的感情

Lucky for both of us I didn't. It'd have been pretty if I'd believed.
注定我是不幸的 不然连你也一样

676
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,970
If I'd figure: she'll never be able to go through with this.

She can make it over by love.

678
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:34,110
If you only once had said that you loved me.
要是你曾说过你爱我

679

You chalked up another boyfriend that's all, no harm done.

Number ten's out in front.
十号马跑在前面

683
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:46,770
Looks as if Sebastian knows how to pick them.

684

Is that all you have to say to me?

685

Dry your eyes, baby,  it's out of character.
把眼相擦干净, 不合身份

686
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:56,040

Snap out of it, here comes dreamboat.
别哭了, 你的心上人来了

688

Hello, Alex! It was so exciting, a beautiful horse.
噢, 亚历克斯!赛马真紧张, 多好的马

- 德弗林先生!  - 你好!

我在看你和你的朋友德弗林先生

I met him purely by accident.

巴伯沙先生, 很庆幸 我们的计划安排得很顺利

00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:29,430
Are you sure she didn't come down here to see you?
你肯定她来这里来不是为了找你这个...

779
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:32,130
To capture the rich Alexander Sebastian for a husband?
...有钱的亚历克塞巴斯蒂安做丈夫?

780
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:34,080
Don't be absurd. She didn't even know I was here.
别瞎想, 她根本不知道我在这儿

781
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:36,170
Well, we'll discuss it more fully tonight.
今天晚上我们得好好的谈谈

782

We'll not discuss it tonight.
今天晚上我们不谈了

783
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,790
All these carping questions are the expression of your jealousy.
所有这些这些问题都出自你的妒忌

784
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,160
You've always been jealous of any woman I've ever shown any interest in.
就是你妒忌我过去中意的那些女人一样

785
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:53,490
In this case, there is nothing more to discuss.
所以这件事没什么好谈的了

786
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:56,210
You mean you're going ahead with this marriage?
那么你的意思就是要结婚了?

787
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:00,420
I mean that the wedding will be next week.
我的意思, 下星期就结婚

788
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:02,710
It will be private.
不请外人

789
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:07,350
We shall both be pleased to have you present, if you wish.
如果你愿意光临, 我无限荣幸!

790
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,190
- Good evening, sir. - Good evening.

- Madam! - Good evening, Joseph.
- 太太!  - 晚上好, 约瑟夫

792
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:46,120
It doesn't look very cheerful here.
哇, 这好像冷冰冰的

793
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:50,220
I'm sorry, Madame Sebastian wasn't certain you would be back tonight.
老太太认定了你今天晚上不会回来

794
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:51,620
Why not? I telegraphed her.
为什么? 我打过电报

795
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:54,390
Madame Sebastian said we were all to retire, sir.

796
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:56,550
Where is my mother?

Madame Sebastian went to bed very early, sir.
老太太很早就睡觉了

798
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:02,600
I'm sorry, dear, I'm afraid this isn't a very bright homecoming.
对不起, 亲爱的, 没想到约你回家会这么冷清

799
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:04,720
- That's all right, Alex. - What shall we do?
- 没关系, 亲爱的 -我们做什么?

800
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:06,930
Shall we have Joseph arrange a little food for us?
是不是叫约瑟夫给我们准备点吃的

801
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:09,530
Not unless you want to. I'm rather tired myself.
你想吃我陪你, 不过我有点累

802
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:11,300
We'll go right up, then.
那我们上去吧

803
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:13,070
- Goodnight, Joseph. - Goodnight, Madam.
- 明天见 - 明天见

804
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:20,080
I'd like to have all my dresses put out on the beds here.
把我所有的衣服都放在床上

805
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,490
Don't hang anything up. I like to know where everything goes.
一件也别挂, 我喜欢自己收拾

806
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:24,610
Joseph, would you've the closets aired?
约瑟夫, 有壁橱吗?

807
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:26,060
Yes, Madame.

808
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:34,830
Oh, this isn't very large. I'll need more room.
哦, 这壁橱不够大, 不够放

809

Do you know where Mr. Sebastian is?

I think he's having a business meeting in the study, Madame.
他大概在楼下跟股东们一起谈生意

815
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:13,160
I miss Hupka. He was a first-class metallurgist.
伊米尔·虎泊克可惜呀 第一流的冶金专家

Such is your opinion.

- 我不想多加批评 - 那你想要什么?

- 噢, 实在对不起, 我... - 进来吧

不, 打扰你们了, 你们正忙着

It's the wine cellar.

Then, the wince cellar's the obvious place to look.

有没有把哪个家伙惹急了的那种酒

It's no fun, Dev.

Too late for that now, isn't it?

Look, why don't you persuade your husband to throw a large shindig...
我说, 为什么不叫你丈夫来个大请客?

The honeymoon isn't over, eh?

请你来恐怕不好吧 他认为你爱我

这样我对你的狂热就从此打消

That sounds very logical.

Good, next week then. And get the key.

不, 约瑟夫说要跟亚历克斯拿酒

906
01:06:08,770 --> 01:06:11,080
He's running out faster than he thought.
酒恐怕喝得差不多了

907
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:12,690
I'm sorry to hear that.
这就很糟糕了

908
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:16,440
- Is he watching? - Yes.
- 他在盯着我们? - 是的

909
01:06:16,570 --> 01:06:19,290
You'd better go out into the garden and wait around the back of the house.
你先到花园里去, 到屋的后面等我

910
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:21,240
I'll show you the wine cellar door.
我领你到酒窖去

911
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:35,290
- Nice party, isn't it? - It's a wonderful party.
- 宴会你满意吗 - 非常满意

912
01:06:35,410 --> 01:06:36,890
I think you've done it wonderfully well.
你今晚的表现太好了

913
01:06:37,010 --> 01:06:39,570
I'm very proud. Mr. Devlin bothering you much?
我很得意 德弗林先生麻烦你了?

914
01:06:39,690 --> 01:06:42,520
No, darling. He's trying to drown his sorrows.
不, 亲爱的, 他借酒消愁呢

915
01:07:23,730 --> 01:07:26,960
Excuse me, think I'll ask the orchestra to play some Brazilian music.
对不起, 我去叫乐队奏一点巴西乐曲

916
01:07:27,090 --> 01:07:28,760
They've played waltzes all evening.
他们一直在奏华尔兹舞曲

917
01:07:28,890 --> 01:07:29,520
All right, dear.

918
01:07:51,370 --> 01:07:53,080
- That's the door. - Right.
- 快进来 - 好的

919
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:59,880
I'll keep the garden door open and I'll tell you if anything happens.
我把去花园的门开着, 有情况我告诉你

920
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:06,600
What's happened?
怎么啦?

921
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:10,440
Look, Vintage sand.
陈酒是沙子?

922
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:15,790
We've got to leave things as we found them.
得把东西按原样搁好

923
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,310
Help me find a bottle of wine with the same label as these others.
找一个同样牌子的酒瓶来

924
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:22,110
- It isn't really sand, is it? - I think it's some kind of metal ore.
- 但这不像是沙子, 对吗? - 大概是一种矿物

925
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:40,550
- This is a bit weird. - I'm terrified.
- 这里头有鬼 - 我怕极了

926
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:44,040
Just pretend you're a janitor. Janitors are never terrified.
就当你是狩猎吧 狩猎时不会害怕的

927
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:45,670
I have a feeling we're very slow.
真觉得我们太慢了

928
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:47,790
We're on schedule. Take it easy.
我们在按计划来, 放轻松点儿

929
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,430
I can hear someone coming.
好像有人来了

930
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,590
Oh, that'll be nice.
哦, 没关系

931
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:54,630
Think if he comes down with Joseph.
他跟约瑟夫一块来了

932
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:56,030
Unfortunate.

933
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:28,350
Someone is coming.
有人来了

934
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:31,520
It's Alex. He's seen us.
亚历克斯来了

935
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:33,520
Wait a minute. I'm going to kiss you.
等等 那我只有亲你

936
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:35,680
- No, he'll only think... - That's what I want him to think.
- 不!他会以为我们 - 就是要让他这样想

937
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:44,080
You better stay upstairs,  they may need you.
你上楼去, 恐怕上面忙不过来

938
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:45,080
Yes, sir.

939

Push me away!

01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:09,670
I'm sorry to intrude on this tender scene.
对不起, 打扰你们的雅兴了

942
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:12,510
I couldn't help what happened: he's been drinking.
一点也没有办法, 他喝多了

943
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,800
So, he carried you down here.

944
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:17,110
Please, Alex!
别这样, 亚历克斯!

945
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:20,950
- You love him. - No, of course not. Please go.
- 你爱他? - 我不爱他, 你走吧

946
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:24,470
For what it's worth, as an apology,  your wife is telling the truth.
你妻子说的真话胜过我对你的道歉

947
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:26,950
I knew her before you,  I loved here before you...
我比你先认识她, 先爱上她

948
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:28,750
but I wasn't as lucky as you.
你比我运气好

949

Sorry, Alicia.

亚历克斯, 别瞎想了, 我...

952
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:43,470
because he threatened to make a scene unless I'd see him alone.
我来这是因为我要不单独跟他见面 他就会吵起来

I couldn't stop him.

We'll talk about it later. Your guests are upstairs.

Mr. Devlin, are you going so soon?

我说约瑟夫... 我看用不着拿那么多的香槟了

I'm sorry about what happened, Alex.

你会娶个美国特工女人

因为你们暂时还不会被人发觉

你今后的任务是 设法弄清这矿沙是从哪来的

1035
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:12,210
The location of the uranium deposit is of vast importance and...
铀矿的所有地点关系极为重大

1036
01:21:12,340 --> 01:21:14,090
we're putting quite a few people on it.
我们已经派很多人去查了

1037
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:16,730
But I think you'll be of great help.
我觉得你...也要出把力

1038
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:17,810
All right.
哦

1039
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:20,970
But that isn't the main reason why I asked you to come up here.
可今天请你来主要不是为了这个

1040
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:23,690
- No? - No, I wanted to tell you...
- 不是这个?  - 我是想告诉你

1041
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:26,560
that I'm going to change your contact in about a week.
不出一星期, 你的联系人要换了

1042
01:21:27,050 --> 01:21:29,610
Mr. Devlin's been transferred to Spain.
德弗林先生要调到西班牙去

1043
01:21:30,930 --> 01:21:32,150
To Spain?

1044
01:21:33,450 --> 01:21:36,640
- Does Mr. Devlin know that? - Oh yes, he asked for the transfer.
- 他自己知道吗? - 知道, 他自己要求调的

1045
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:37,720
Why?

1046
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,910
I guess he thought he was going to stale here.

1047
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:42,560
Oh, he wants to leave Rio.
他想离开这儿?

1048
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:46,750
He thought he'd find Spain more interesting.
或许他觉得... 西班牙更有意义

1049
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:50,380
Yes, I imagine it would be. There really isn't very much...
是呀, 我看也是这样

1050
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:53,900
for a brainy fellow like Mr. Devlin to do in Rio any more.
对德弗林先生这样聪明的人来说 这儿实在没可能有可乘之机

1051
01:21:54,030 --> 01:21:56,540
Well, of course, it is more or less routine now.
对了, 这儿现在没什么要紧事了

1052
01:21:58,230 --> 01:22:02,010
In the meantime I'm to report to Mr. Devlin as usual.
那么, 眼前, 我还是向德弗林先生报告吗?

对, 新任没到之前他还在这儿

Thank you, Captain Prescott,  I'll keep my ears wide open.
谢谢, 布莱斯特上校, 我会留心观察的

1055
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:10,890
- Good bye. - Good bye.

Oh, and... go easy on that sun, eh?

Darling, what is it?

1058
01:22:29,770 --> 01:22:31,430
I don't know.

01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:35,840
- Are you in pain? - Yes, I'm so dizzy.

1060

We were walking and she was stricken suddenly.

I'll be all right. Let's go inside.

1063
01:23:03,940 --> 01:23:05,690
I'm sorry I couldn't make it on time.
对不起, 我来晚了

1064
01:23:05,820 --> 01:23:08,490
Well, it gets a bit Ionely squatting on a bench all day.
整天坐在长凳上, 真有点冷清

1065
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:11,770
Yes, Rio can be a very dull town.

1066
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:13,490
What's new?

Any footprints in that sand yet?

1073
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,920
Just a social visit, huh?
今天就为打个照面

1074
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:35,950
A little fresh air helps.
换换空气也好

1075
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:38,470

No. Hangover.

That's news. Back to the bottle again, huh?
真是新闻, 又喝起来了

1079
01:23:52,870 --> 01:23:55,980
Sort of lightens my chores.
可不, 借酒消愁嘛

1080
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:59,300
- Big party? - Just the family circle.
- 大请客呀 - 家里人聚聚

1081

it helps life in a dull town.
只不过太无聊了

1083

You ought to take it easy on that liquor.
你这样使劲喝可不行啊

1084
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:13,410
Don't you find Rio a little hard to take, too?
你不是觉得这... 太没劲了吗?

1085
01:24:14,890 --> 01:24:16,400
Not a bad town.

You look all mashed up: must have been quite an evening.

1089
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,110
No reason why you shouldn't.
谁也拦不住你

1090
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:32,390
That's right, Dev. Here's something that belongs to you.
说得对, 德弗林 这一样东西是你的

I should have given it to you sooner.
我早该还给你了

- What is it? - The scarf you lent me once in Miami.

Well, goodbye, Dev.

Nothing, just goodbye.

01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:02,890
Fresh air isn't as good for a hangover as I thought.
新鲜空气并不像我想像的那样新鲜

1099
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:04,570
Sit down, you're still tight.

You look like something awful.

Circles under the eyes...

I never go near doctors.

They always want to cart you off to a hospital.

Tell me when did you first feel sick?

would be much better for you darling nor doctors or hospitals.

A little cruise somewhere. Maybe Spain?

Put the roses back in your cheeks, my sweet.

We could go together, my dear.

如果你舍得离开亚历克斯一个星期

I always get seasick.

Then you might like the mountains.

The air's fresh and pure and...

艾尔瑞新群山真美呀 到处都是鲜花

And when I come back you will be all well...
