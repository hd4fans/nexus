1
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,588
Little Frank.

2
00:01:49,713 --> 00:01:52,757
- You take care of your ma. - I will.

3
00:01:58,639 --> 00:02:02,058
- You're not travelling heavy, Tom. - I got all I need.

4
00:02:07,566 --> 00:02:11,611
You should be taking the train, Frank. Fort Smith is too long a ride.

5
00:02:11,737 --> 00:02:15,406
On Judy, 70 miles will be just a pleasant outing.

6
00:02:16,658 --> 00:02:19,535
Yarnell, you'll take care of the place for me.

7
00:02:19,662 --> 00:02:23,790
You and my Mattie. Where's Mattie?

8
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:26,793
I'm here, Papa!

9
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:35,303
Well, Little Bookkeeper, got my wherewithal ready?

10
00:02:35,513 --> 00:02:38,598
- Of course. - How much are you allowing me?

11
00:02:38,724 --> 00:02:41,476
There's... right around...

12
00:02:44,355 --> 00:02:47,190
...$150 cash money there.

13
00:02:48,109 --> 00:02:50,652
Better hand me my good luck gold pieces, too.

14
00:02:51,697 --> 00:02:56,201
Buying Texas mustang ponies, you'll need plenty of luck!

15
00:02:56,368 --> 00:03:01,581
You'll come around to my plan. I intend to buy as many as I can swing.

16
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:07,713
- We'll breed them for deer- hunting. - They're small and chicken- brained!

17
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,175
I'd say small and tough, right for keeping up with dogs.

18
00:03:12,302 --> 00:03:15,512
- You want my advice, Papa? - I always do.

19
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:19,183
- Buy the ponies cheap. - I expect to.

20
00:03:19,727 --> 00:03:24,231
This Colonel Stonehill has got to get rid of them before winter.

21
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:28,319
Papa, that gun's old- fashioned. Buy a new one at Fort Smith.

22
00:03:28,444 --> 00:03:32,822
It served me well at Chickamauga, and it's got a long way to go yet.

23
00:03:45,713 --> 00:03:48,173
Goodbye, Papa!

24
00:03:55,765 --> 00:03:58,683
Tom Chaney... Now there's trash for you.

25
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,311
It's his job to look after the place.

26
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:05,358
Papa took him in when he was starving and gave him a house.

27
00:04:05,484 --> 00:04:08,861
Come, Mattie, it's only an old tool- shed.

28
00:04:08,988 --> 00:04:12,532
You can still throw a cat through the south wall!

29
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:14,827
It's got a good roof.

30
00:04:18,915 --> 00:04:21,291
- This game's crooked! - What?

31
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,211
You've been dealing me seconds!

32
00:04:25,923 --> 00:04:28,883
Goddamn crooks! You're stackin' the decks!

33
00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:37,768
Come on, Tom. We want to make an early start for home.

34
00:04:37,936 --> 00:04:41,897
I'm going back in there. I want to get my money back!

35
00:04:42,024 --> 00:04:44,400
Not full of whisky and with a gun. That's no way.

36
00:04:44,526 --> 00:04:49,488
- A gun'll say a whole lot quick. - I won't allow you to get into trouble.

37
00:04:50,407 --> 00:04:52,825
- Gimme your gun. - I'll give you one end of it!

38
00:04:52,952 --> 00:04:55,829
Gimme the gun! Gimme your gun!

39
00:05:25,404 --> 00:05:26,821
All aboard!

40
00:05:30,576 --> 00:05:32,535
Where's the undertaker?

41
00:05:32,703 --> 00:05:35,663
Round the corner from the courthouse, ma'am.

42
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:37,498
Thank you.

43
00:05:43,464 --> 00:05:45,673
I can't understand all these people being here.

44
00:05:45,842 --> 00:05:48,886
Everybody comes in from every place.

45
00:05:49,054 --> 00:05:53,516
- I'd like to know why. - They're hanging three men today.

46
00:05:53,684 --> 00:05:56,686
We'd better go and see about Papa.

47
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:25,134
Looks like he's out rustling up business for himself.

48
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:31,056
Seems like we have some time to waste before we see anybody.

49
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,893
I can tell you want to go to the hanging.

50
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:38,063
Afraid I can't. Your mama said keep an eye on you.

51
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,109
Well, I'll go along.

52
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:45,071
Don't worry, I won't tell Mama.

53
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:54,080
I was once lost

54
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:58,794
But now am found

55
00:06:58,962 --> 00:07:05,509
Was blind but now I see

56
00:07:07,555 --> 00:07:11,975
'Twas grace that taught

57
00:07:12,144 --> 00:07:16,731
My heart to fear

58
00:07:16,856 --> 00:07:23,570
And grace my fears relieved

59
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:29,202
How sweet the sound...

60
00:07:29,495 --> 00:07:32,038
That man up there on the porch...

61
00:07:36,503 --> 00:07:39,797
That's Judge Parker. He watches all the hangings.

62
00:07:39,964 --> 00:07:45,010
- He says it's his sense of duty. - Who knows what's in a man's heart?

63
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:52,018
... Amen.

64
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:00,945
The hangman's a Yankee.

65
00:08:01,071 --> 00:08:06,117
They say he won't spring the trap on a boy that wore the blue.

66
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:12,665
No, I'm here, I'll see it all.

67
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,513
My goodness!

68
00:08:36,859 --> 00:08:39,235
That's not a faint- hearted judge.

69
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:42,822
Chaney'll get his due before such a judge.

70
00:09:05,932 --> 00:09:08,850
Is that the man?

71
00:09:10,813 --> 00:09:13,606
That is my father.

72
00:09:15,276 --> 00:09:19,237
If you would like to kiss him, it would be all right.

73
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,909
No...

74
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,250
Put the lid on it.

75
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:26,976
I'm Mattie Ross of Dardanelle in Yell County.

76
00:10:27,103 --> 00:10:31,899
And this is my friend, Yarnell Pointdexter, who works on our place.

77
00:10:32,025 --> 00:10:33,817
Yes, ma'am. State your business.

78
00:10:35,028 --> 00:10:39,240
My father was killed in Fort Smith by a coward named Tom Chaney.

79
00:10:39,366 --> 00:10:41,617
What are you doing about the murder?

80
00:10:41,743 --> 00:10:45,913
We do know this: His name's Chambers, he's in Indian territory.

81
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:51,169
We think he robbed a mail hack Tuesday down on the Poteau River.

82
00:10:51,337 --> 00:10:54,214
He's medium height, with a black mark on his cheek.

83
00:10:54,341 --> 00:10:58,761
That's Tom Chaney. There's no Chambers to it.

84
00:10:58,887 --> 00:11:05,309
He got that black mark when a man fired a pistol in his face.

85
00:11:05,435 --> 00:11:10,981
- Why aren't you out looking for him? - I've no authority in the Indian Nation.

86
00:11:11,108 --> 00:11:14,193
He's now the business of the US Marshal.

87
00:11:14,362 --> 00:11:21,160
- Who's the best marshal they have? - Bill Waters is the best tracker.

88
00:11:21,286 --> 00:11:26,165
The meanest one is Rooster Cogburn, double- tough, knows no fear.

89
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:30,294
L T Quinn is the straightest. He brings them in alive.

90
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:35,675
- Where would I find this Rooster? - At the Federal Court this afternoon.

91
00:11:35,802 --> 00:11:38,053
He's bringing in prisoners from the territory.

92
00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:43,225
- Is Chaney one of them? - I don't know. That's federal business.

93
00:11:43,435 --> 00:11:49,398
Your father's gun... you'll want to take it home, I expect.

94
00:11:49,733 --> 00:11:53,736
His saddle is at Colonel Stonehill's stock barn,

95
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:58,324
and the rest of his things are at the Monarch boarding house.

96
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:02,996
I won't rest till Tom Chaney's barking in hell!

97
00:12:09,505 --> 00:12:11,464
Yarnell...

98
00:12:12,884 --> 00:12:14,968
You stay with Papa.

99
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:19,430
When you get home, put him in a better coffin with Mason's apron.

100
00:12:19,724 --> 00:12:21,433
Your mama wants you home.

101
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:29,066
Mama knows I can take care of myself. Tell her not to sign anything till I return.

102
00:12:29,193 --> 00:12:31,778
People'll take it wrong that I leave this to you,

103
00:12:31,946 --> 00:12:34,114
but I got Papa's business to see to.

104
00:12:34,323 --> 00:12:37,283
Tell Mama I'm staying at the Monarch boarding house.

105
00:12:37,493 --> 00:12:41,454
I'm going to see if Tom Chaney's been brought in.

106
00:12:41,789 --> 00:12:44,749
And then I'll see this Rooster Cogburn.

107
00:12:55,346 --> 00:12:59,182
All right, get outta the way! Back up!

108
00:13:10,987 --> 00:13:12,362
Stand up!

109
00:13:13,281 --> 00:13:15,073
Come on out!

110
00:13:19,038 --> 00:13:20,538
Move along!

111
00:13:20,873 --> 00:13:22,498
Are the prisoners from the Indian Territory?

112
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:26,336
- Yes, ma'am. - Is one of them Tom Chaney?

113
00:13:26,504 --> 00:13:29,381
Cogburn ain't turned in his list yet.

114
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:34,136
- Which marshal is Rooster Cogburn? - The big fella with the eye- patch.

115
00:13:39,017 --> 00:13:40,350
Come on!

116
00:13:45,233 --> 00:13:47,234
All right, take it away!

117
00:13:47,402 --> 00:13:51,906
- Mr Cogburn! - Wait! Come back here!

118
00:13:52,074 --> 00:13:53,866
Mr Cogburn!

119
00:13:53,992 --> 00:13:56,410
Come back here!

120
00:13:58,622 --> 00:14:01,040
All right, come on up.

121
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:05,086
If he thinks I'm put off by a locked door, he doesn't know me!

122
00:14:05,254 --> 00:14:09,048
- I'll be here when it opens. - Then you'll be mighty hungry.

123
00:14:09,217 --> 00:14:11,385
Best time to nail him is tomorrow.

124
00:14:11,553 --> 00:14:14,346
He's testifying before Judge Parker.

125
00:14:23,315 --> 00:14:27,568
Thank you very much. I appreciate your kindness.

126
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,543
Have some more dumplings, dear?

127
00:14:44,296 --> 00:14:47,924
At 25 cents per meal, I might just as well.

128
00:14:50,302 --> 00:14:52,595
I was hoping you were enjoying them.

129
00:14:52,972 --> 00:14:58,101
They're all right. I can't see 25 cents in a little flour and grease.

130
00:15:06,153 --> 00:15:09,447
- You're late, Mr La Boof. - The French is 'La Boeuf'.

131
00:15:09,574 --> 00:15:12,117
I call it 'La Beef'.

132
00:15:18,124 --> 00:15:21,334
Mr La Beef came in this evening.

133
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,004
Your spurs, please.

134
00:15:24,172 --> 00:15:27,674
My poor chairs are scratched enough already.

135
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,982
A right fancy rig, sir.

136
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:47,153
Watch out for the chicken and dumplings.

137
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:50,324
- They'll hurt your eyes. - How's that?

138
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:54,496
They'll hurt your eyes looking for the chicken!

139
00:15:55,665 --> 00:15:58,333
You squirrel- headed bastard!

140
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:03,170
Howdy. What's your name?

141
00:16:05,258 --> 00:16:09,052
I'd like to go to bed now. But first I'd like to see my father's traps.

142
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,610
I'll take a guess and say your name is Mattie Ross.

143
00:16:33,747 --> 00:16:37,667
- Mr La Beef is a handsome man. - He needs a bath and a shave.

144
00:16:37,793 --> 00:16:42,046
- He hails from Texas. - Judge he's proud of his cowlick.

145
00:16:42,215 --> 00:16:46,385
- How did he guess my name? - He's a good guesser, I guess!

146
00:16:48,221 --> 00:16:51,223
We're short of rooms on account of the hanging.

147
00:16:51,432 --> 00:16:53,558
You'll sleep in here with Grandma Turner.

148
00:16:53,768 --> 00:16:58,188
Don't worry about Grandma Turner, she's used to doubling up.

149
00:16:58,315 --> 00:17:01,400
I take it my rent will be half, then?

150
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:05,404
These are your father's traps. The watch and the knife are inside.

151
00:17:05,573 --> 00:17:08,241
Chaney stole his money and his horse.

152
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:24,633
What do you think of Marshal Rooster Cogburn?

153
00:17:24,802 --> 00:17:29,431
Rooster Cogburn! I've heard some terrible things about him!

154
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,559
He loves to pull a cork, I know that!

155
00:18:41,885 --> 00:18:46,138
His Honour, Judge Parker! All rise!

156
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:52,187
I'll have a peppermint to settle my stomach.

157
00:18:52,313 --> 00:18:54,230
Yes, sir.

158
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:08,704
The United States Court of the Western District,

159
00:19:08,872 --> 00:19:13,459
having criminal jurisdiction in the Indian Territory, is now in session.

160
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:15,837
Is that Judge Parker, the hanging judge?

161
00:19:15,963 --> 00:19:22,510
He's a tough customer. There's no appeal except to the President himself!

162
00:19:24,847 --> 00:19:27,640
Call Deputy Marshal Cogburn.

163
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:32,354
Mr Reuben J Cogburn will take the stand.

164
00:19:39,447 --> 00:19:42,824
You were sworn this morning, you're still sworn.

165
00:19:42,951 --> 00:19:45,494
Defence will cross- examine.

166
00:19:52,502 --> 00:19:58,465
Mr Cogburn, you testified for the prosecution this morning.

167
00:19:58,634 --> 00:20:03,388
Allow me to summarise what you said. According to your story...

168
00:20:03,514 --> 00:20:07,600
...C C Wharton grabbed a shotgun and killed Marshal Potter.

169
00:20:07,728 --> 00:20:11,773
Then he turned the gun on you, and you shot him.

170
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:16,777
Then the father swung his axe, and you shot him, too.

171
00:20:16,903 --> 00:20:21,615
The defendant tried to run, you say, and you also shot him.

172
00:20:21,742 --> 00:20:25,286
Just winged him, or he wouldn't be here to pay up!

173
00:20:25,455 --> 00:20:28,791
The old man and CC hit the ground dead.

174
00:20:29,459 --> 00:20:33,545
How long have you been a Deputy Marshal, Mr Cogburn?

175
00:20:33,672 --> 00:20:36,632
Four years, come March.

176
00:20:36,758 --> 00:20:39,468
How many men have you shot in that time?

177
00:20:39,594 --> 00:20:42,512
- The prosecution objects! - Overruled!

178
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:49,312
How many men have you shot since becoming a marshal?

179
00:20:49,522 --> 00:20:54,818
- I never shot nobody I didn't have to! - That's not the question. How many?

180
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:57,447
Shot or killed?

181
00:20:57,573 --> 00:21:01,534
Let's restrict it to killed, a more manageable figure!

182
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:06,330
Well, twelve to fifteen, stopping men in flight and defending myself.

183
00:21:06,457 --> 00:21:10,877
Twelve to fifteen? So many you can't keep a specific count.

184
00:21:11,045 --> 00:21:13,671
I have examined the records.

185
00:21:13,882 --> 00:21:17,968
A more accurate figure is available. Come now, how many?

186
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,014
Counting them two Whartons, twenty- three.

187
00:21:22,391 --> 00:21:25,017
I felt you'd come to it with a little effort.

188
00:21:25,353 --> 00:21:30,315
Twenty- three dead men in four years. That makes about six men a year!

189
00:21:30,482 --> 00:21:35,611
- It's a dangerous business. - How much more for those you arrest!

190
00:21:35,738 --> 00:21:40,116
Is it not true that you sprang upon the Whartons

191
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:42,703
with a deadly six- shot revolver?

192
00:21:42,913 --> 00:21:47,667
- I always try to be ready. - Was this revolver loaded and cocked?

193
00:21:47,793 --> 00:21:50,795
A gun that's unloaded ain't good for nothing!

194
00:21:50,922 --> 00:21:52,964
Just answer, if you please.

195
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:58,595
- The question don't make sense! - Don't bandy words with counsel.

196
00:21:58,763 --> 00:22:00,555
Yes, sir.

197
00:22:00,724 --> 00:22:03,726
You testified you backed away from old man Wharton.

198
00:22:03,935 --> 00:22:06,728
- Yes, sir. - Which direction?

199
00:22:06,897 --> 00:22:10,358
Backward! I always go backward when I'm backing away!

200
00:22:10,484 --> 00:22:12,735
I appreciate the humour of that remark.

201
00:22:12,862 --> 00:22:16,072
Aaron Wharton was standing by a pot when you arrived?

202
00:22:16,448 --> 00:22:20,785
More like squatting. He was stirring the fire under the pot.

203
00:22:20,953 --> 00:22:25,915
- How far did you back away? - Six, eight steps.

204
00:22:26,126 --> 00:22:30,713
Meaning Wharton advanced the same distance? Six or eight steps?

205
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:33,757
- Sixteen feet? - Something like that.

206
00:22:33,884 --> 00:22:37,929
Then explain why the body was found by the wash pot,

207
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:42,017
one arm in the flames, the sleeve and hand smouldering.

208
00:22:42,143 --> 00:22:47,105
Them hogs! They may have moved the body.

209
00:22:48,859 --> 00:22:50,568
Hogs, indeed!

210
00:22:50,694 --> 00:22:54,155
Mr Goudy, do you have any more questions?

211
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:58,034
None that I'll get a straight answer to. I'm finished with him.

212
00:22:58,161 --> 00:23:01,163
You're dismissed, Mr Cogburn.

213
00:23:01,498 --> 00:23:03,624
Call the next witness!

214
00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:09,671
Cecil Falling Leaf, take the stand!

215
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,137
Raise your right hand...

216
00:23:24,022 --> 00:23:26,857
- Mr Rooster Cogburn? - What is it?

217
00:23:27,776 --> 00:23:31,988
I'd like to talk with you a minute. They say you're a man with true grit.

218
00:23:32,113 --> 00:23:34,656
What do you want? Speak up!

219
00:23:35,742 --> 00:23:38,494
You've already wrinkled the paper...

220
00:23:38,662 --> 00:23:42,540
It's pretty loose because your makings are too dry.

221
00:23:45,712 --> 00:23:47,921
I'm looking for Tom Chaney.

222
00:23:48,048 --> 00:23:49,673
Well, who's he?

223
00:23:49,883 --> 00:23:52,801
He shot and killed my father, Frank Ross.

224
00:23:52,928 --> 00:23:56,222
He's in the Indian Territory. I need somebody to go after him.

225
00:23:56,557 --> 00:23:58,558
- Who are you? - Mattie Ross.

226
00:23:58,725 --> 00:24:03,145
My family has 480 acres of good bottomland in Yell County.

227
00:24:03,522 --> 00:24:06,691
Mother's home looking after my baby sister and brother.

228
00:24:06,817 --> 00:24:10,236
Why don't you go home and leave me alone?

229
00:24:10,572 --> 00:24:13,282
They'll need help with the churning!

230
00:24:18,706 --> 00:24:20,164
Mr Cogburn!

231
00:24:25,546 --> 00:24:29,924
You can get a fugitive warrant for Chaney and $2 for bringing him in,

232
00:24:30,092 --> 00:24:34,637
plus 10 cents a mile for each of you, and I'll give you $50 reward!

233
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:37,057
You've looked into this right smart.

234
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:39,268
Yes, I mean business.

235
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,937
What have you got in your poke?

236
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:48,236
By God, girl, that's a Colt's Dragoon!

237
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:52,615
You're no bigger than a corn nubbin. What are you doing with this pistol?

238
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:55,743
My father carried it bravely in the war.

239
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:59,581
I intend to kill Tom Chaney with it if the law fails.

240
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:05,838
This'll sure get the job done, if you can find a fence post to rest it on

241
00:25:05,965 --> 00:25:07,966
while you take aim!

242
00:25:09,636 --> 00:25:14,014
I'm afraid nothing'll be done about Chaney unless I do it myself.

243
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:19,311
- I don't think you've got $50. - After my horse- trading, I'll have it.

244
00:25:19,646 --> 00:25:22,314
Do you know the robber Lucky Ned Pepper?

245
00:25:22,649 --> 00:25:25,359
I know him... well!

246
00:25:25,652 --> 00:25:30,114
I shot him in the lip last August over at Winding Stair Mountains.

247
00:25:30,283 --> 00:25:33,952
He was lucky that day, my shooting was off!

248
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,371
Well, I think Chaney's tied up with him.

249
00:25:36,665 --> 00:25:39,125
- Yeah? - Yeah!

250
00:25:46,758 --> 00:25:49,760
- Ned Pepper, huh? - Yeah...

251
00:25:51,722 --> 00:25:55,308
Baby sister, I don't think you can get $50.

252
00:25:55,643 --> 00:25:57,977
But I'll take you home and give you supper.

253
00:25:58,146 --> 00:26:01,982
We'll talk it over, make medicine. How does that suit you?

254
00:26:02,149 --> 00:26:03,899
Right down to the ground.

255
00:26:04,027 --> 00:26:06,361
I'd like to meet your family.

256
00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:27,844
This is my father, Chen Lee.

257
00:26:27,969 --> 00:26:31,680
And my nephew, General Sterling Price.

258
00:26:46,823 --> 00:26:48,448
You want more, Missy?

259
00:26:48,742 --> 00:26:51,869
I've had enough, and enough is as good as a feast.

260
00:26:53,037 --> 00:26:56,456
I've never seen chopsticks work before.

261
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:59,752
Chopsticks save the fingers.

262
00:27:11,183 --> 00:27:14,018
- Gimme your cup. - I don't drink coffee, thank you.

263
00:27:14,144 --> 00:27:18,898
- Well, what do you drink? - I'm partial to cold buttermilk.

264
00:27:19,107 --> 00:27:25,029
Well, we ain't got none of that. We ain't got no lemonade either.

265
00:27:26,365 --> 00:27:28,282
Let's get to the game.

266
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:46,093
- My deal? - Yes, sir.

267
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,763
- What about my proposition? - Thinking on it.

268
00:27:48,973 --> 00:27:52,517
Sounds like a mighty easy way to make $50 to me.

269
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:56,354
Don't crowd me, I'm figuring expenses.

270
00:27:57,399 --> 00:28:01,986
How you can play cards, drink whisky and think detective at the same time?

271
00:28:02,154 --> 00:28:08,535
Well, if I have to go up against Ned Pepper, it'll cost $100, I figure.

272
00:28:08,827 --> 00:28:10,869
And 50 in advance.

273
00:28:10,996 --> 00:28:15,458
- You're trying to take advantage of me. - They're my children's rates!

274
00:28:15,835 --> 00:28:18,753
It isn't going to be easy smoking old Ned out.

275
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,965
He'll be holed up down that Indian Nation.

276
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:26,429
Well, I'm not going to keep you in whisky!

277
00:28:26,555 --> 00:28:30,057
I don't buy that, I confiscate it!

278
00:28:30,184 --> 00:28:34,396
A touch of it wouldn't do you any harm against the night air!

279
00:28:34,522 --> 00:28:39,151
It's the real article, genuine double- rectified bust- head!

280
00:28:39,277 --> 00:28:41,027
Aged in the keg.

281
00:28:41,196 --> 00:28:44,490
I wouldn't put a thief in my mouth to steal my brains.

282
00:28:44,867 --> 00:28:50,789
Well, sis, my price is $100. There it is. Want to make medicine?

283
00:28:50,957 --> 00:28:53,458
I will think about your proposition.

284
00:28:53,585 --> 00:28:56,837
You better walk me over to the boarding house.

285
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,506
You are a lot of trouble.

286
00:29:00,842 --> 00:29:03,510
Wait till I finish this hand.

287
00:29:07,182 --> 00:29:13,229
You can't tell what's in a Chinaman's mind. That's the way he bests you!

288
00:29:14,565 --> 00:29:16,357
I go.

289
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:25,074
Scat!

290
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:30,330
Mr Rat...

291
00:29:30,457 --> 00:29:35,920
My writ here says you must stop eating Chen Lee's cornmeal forthwith.

292
00:29:36,088 --> 00:29:42,927
It's a rat writ, writ for a rat, and this is lawful service of same.

293
00:29:43,096 --> 00:29:46,473
See, he doesn't pay any attention to me.

294
00:29:48,643 --> 00:29:50,852
Outside is the place for shooting!

295
00:29:50,979 --> 00:29:53,397
I'm serving some papers.

296
00:30:14,963 --> 00:30:17,923
That was your job in the first place!

297
00:30:20,636 --> 00:30:25,306
You can't serve papers on a rat, baby sister.

298
00:30:25,475 --> 00:30:29,103
You've got to kill him or let him be.

299
00:30:29,312 --> 00:30:31,313
Are you going to drink all of that?

300
00:30:33,275 --> 00:30:36,110
Judge Parker... Old Carpetbagger!

301
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:39,447
But he knows his rats. We had a good court...

302
00:30:39,573 --> 00:30:43,493
...until those pettifogging lawyers moved in.

303
00:30:43,661 --> 00:30:46,997
The ratcatcher's too tough on the rats!

304
00:30:47,165 --> 00:30:49,666
"Give them rats a fair show," they say.

305
00:30:50,001 --> 00:30:53,295
What fair show did they give old man Potter?

306
00:30:53,422 --> 00:30:56,424
Tell me that. Finer man never lived.

307
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:59,135
You're useless in this condition.

308
00:30:59,345 --> 00:31:01,554
I'll walk over there by myself.

309
00:31:01,681 --> 00:31:04,474
- You scared of the dark? - Never!

310
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:09,145
If I had a big horse- pistol like that, I wouldn't be scared of the booger man.

311
00:31:09,355 --> 00:31:11,689
I'm not scared of no booger man.

312
00:31:20,492 --> 00:31:22,117
- Sugar? - No thanks.

313
00:31:22,286 --> 00:31:24,245
- Cream? - Please.

314
00:31:25,206 --> 00:31:26,664
Just a dab.

315
00:31:26,958 --> 00:31:28,750
Miss Ross!

316
00:31:29,043 --> 00:31:31,461
I'd like some private words with you.

317
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:36,383
And you I find a sweet distraction, as most men do.

318
00:31:36,551 --> 00:31:39,595
- Will you excuse us? - Of course, Mr La Beef.

319
00:31:46,395 --> 00:31:49,564
What do you want of me? Who are you?

320
00:31:49,732 --> 00:31:52,650
I'm nobody yet, but I expect to go high.

321
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:54,486
How?

322
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:57,572
To begin with, I expect to marry well.

323
00:31:57,699 --> 00:32:00,033
You have the haircomb for it.

324
00:32:00,201 --> 00:32:04,496
- How did you know my name? - I saw your mother yesterday.

325
00:32:05,582 --> 00:32:08,250
What business did you have with her?

326
00:32:09,462 --> 00:32:12,714
This. Can you identify the man in this picture?

327
00:32:13,049 --> 00:32:17,010
That's a likeness of Chaney, with no black mark on his face.

328
00:32:17,137 --> 00:32:18,721
But that's him.

329
00:32:19,055 --> 00:32:23,475
I'm looking for him, and you are, too. I know all about your father.

330
00:32:23,601 --> 00:32:26,102
Why didn't you show me this last night?

331
00:32:26,229 --> 00:32:30,399
I only take one step at a time. That's why I was given two feet.

332
00:32:30,568 --> 00:32:35,781
His real name is Theron Chelmsford. He killed a senator in Waco, Texas.

333
00:32:36,115 --> 00:32:38,408
I've been on his trail almost 4 months.

334
00:32:38,535 --> 00:32:42,288
- You're some kind of law? - I'm a sergeant in the Texas Rangers.

335
00:32:42,456 --> 00:32:44,749
I'm working for the family of the late senator.

336
00:32:45,041 --> 00:32:48,794
Chelmsford, or Chaney, shot the senator's bird dog.

337
00:32:49,129 --> 00:32:52,798
The senator threatened to whip him, and Chaney shot him.

338
00:32:53,801 --> 00:32:57,303
Don't worry about Chaney any more. I aim to have him hanged.

339
00:32:57,472 --> 00:33:01,684
The sheriff told me you were looking for a man to go after him.

340
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:05,271
I've already found one for the job, Rooster Cogburn.

341
00:33:05,439 --> 00:33:09,192
He's the toughest deputy marshal they have.

342
00:33:09,317 --> 00:33:12,194
Maybe I'll throw in with you and the federal marshal.

343
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,781
- You'll have to talk to him. - There's mutual advantage.

344
00:33:16,158 --> 00:33:18,284
He knows the land, and I know Chaney.

345
00:33:18,411 --> 00:33:20,871
It's at least a two- man job to take him alive.

346
00:33:21,164 --> 00:33:24,249
I must have him alive down to Texas.

347
00:33:24,376 --> 00:33:28,754
We're not taking him back to Texas. We'll take him to Fort Smith to hang.

348
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:31,799
- Is it important where he hangs? - It is to me.

349
00:33:32,092 --> 00:33:37,638
More so to me. There's a lady in Waco who'd look favourably on me.

350
00:33:37,848 --> 00:33:41,350
A hanging in Texas would serve just as well.

351
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,648
No! I want Chaney to pay for killing my father, not for some bird dog!

352
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:50,861
It won't be for the dog! It'll be for the senator and your father.

353
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:52,488
He'll be just as dead.

354
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:59,245
If I couldn't find Chaney in 4 months, I would not advise others how to do it!

355
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:02,498
Earlier I thought of stealing a kiss from you,

356
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:06,545
although you are very young and unattractive to boot!

357
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:10,173
But now I'd sooner give you some licks with my belt!

358
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,802
One would be as unpleasant as the other!

359
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:16,305
You Texans are ignorant of our ways.

360
00:34:16,432 --> 00:34:19,684
We don't go easy on men who abuse women and children.

361
00:34:19,894 --> 00:34:23,814
Texan children show more respect for their elders.

362
00:34:24,189 --> 00:34:29,527
Texans gouge their horses with brutal spurs and cultivate their hair like lettuce!

363
00:34:29,737 --> 00:34:32,572
You'll push that saucy line too far.

364
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,657
I have no regard for you,

365
00:34:34,784 --> 00:34:38,745
but I'm sure you have enough for yourself to go around!

366
00:34:50,301 --> 00:34:52,719
They are all for sale.

367
00:34:53,846 --> 00:34:56,973
Except those four scrubby ones.

368
00:34:57,267 --> 00:35:02,229
- And... who do they belong to? - The heirs of the late Frank Ross.

369
00:35:02,356 --> 00:35:06,359
I'm Mattie Ross, and I'd like to sell you back those ponies.

370
00:35:06,569 --> 00:35:08,945
That's out of the question.

371
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,201
My father bought them for breeding, but they're all geldings.

372
00:35:14,327 --> 00:35:17,746
- You cannot breed geldings. - That hardly concerns me.

373
00:35:17,914 --> 00:35:21,792
He bought four ponies for $100, and there's an end of it.

374
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,379
I want $300 for Papa's saddle horse, stolen from your barn.

375
00:35:25,547 --> 00:35:29,842
- Take it up with the man who stole it. - He stole it while it was in your care.

376
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:32,887
You are responsible.

377
00:35:33,014 --> 00:35:35,974
I admire your sand, but... I'm not liable.

378
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:40,229
- I will take it to the law. - Do as you think best.

379
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:44,608
We'll see if a widow and three children can get fair treatment in these courts.

380
00:35:44,734 --> 00:35:49,988
- You have no case. - Lawyer Daggett may think otherwise.

381
00:35:50,324 --> 00:35:53,493
- You are impudent. - I do not wish to be, sir.

382
00:35:53,661 --> 00:35:56,454
But I will not be pushed about.

383
00:35:57,248 --> 00:36:00,709
- I'll take it up with my attorney. - And I with mine.

384
00:36:00,836 --> 00:36:04,630
He and I will make money, and your lawyer will make money.

385
00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:07,841
And you, Mr Auctioneer, will foot the bill!

386
00:36:08,009 --> 00:36:09,885
You're a damned nuisance!

387
00:36:10,012 --> 00:36:15,308
Who is this famous pleader, of whom I was ignorant 10 minutes ago?

388
00:36:15,518 --> 00:36:20,564
You've heard of the Great Arkansas River Vicksburg and Gulf Company?

389
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:23,024
I have done business with the GAV & G, yes.

390
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,986
My lawyer forced them into receivership.

391
00:36:26,864 --> 00:36:29,490
They tried to mess with him.

392
00:36:31,034 --> 00:36:33,494
All right, come inside.

393
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:39,542
Sit down.

394
00:36:41,963 --> 00:36:47,926
I will pay a total of $200 to your father's estate

395
00:36:48,053 --> 00:36:52,849
when I have in my hand a letter absolving me of all liability

396
00:36:53,017 --> 00:36:54,976
from the beginning of the world to date!

397
00:36:55,102 --> 00:37:01,065
I want $200 for the horse duty plus another $100 for the ponies.

398
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:04,528
The ponies have no part in this. I won't buy them back.

399
00:37:04,696 --> 00:37:08,908
I'll keep the ponies, and the price for Judy will be $300.

400
00:37:09,075 --> 00:37:14,872
I wouldn't pay that for Pegasus! Listen, as I will not bargain further.

401
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:20,795
I will take the ponies back, keep your father's saddle for $200.

402
00:37:20,921 --> 00:37:25,049
My lawyer would not wish me to consider anything under $300.

403
00:37:25,384 --> 00:37:28,761
That's for everything except the saddle.

404
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:35,019
I would like to have that in writing, for what it's worth.

405
00:37:35,145 --> 00:37:39,732
When I have it in my hand, I'll remit the extortion money.

406
00:37:39,942 --> 00:37:43,736
This is your release. You'll find it in order.

407
00:37:43,947 --> 00:37:47,032
You had that already written out.

408
00:37:48,826 --> 00:37:52,912
- I'll give you a cheque. - I prefer cash.

409
00:37:58,796 --> 00:38:01,130
One hundred, two hundred...

410
00:38:02,425 --> 00:38:03,883
...three hundred.

411
00:38:11,434 --> 00:38:14,561
You'll find a buyer for those ponies very soon.

412
00:38:14,687 --> 00:38:19,733
I have a tentative offer of $10 a head from the soap works at Little Rock.

413
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,862
Such a shame to render spirited horseflesh into soap.

414
00:38:22,988 --> 00:38:27,200
- I'm sure the deal will fall through. - Expect me back for my saddle.

415
00:38:27,493 --> 00:38:29,786
I'm sure I can!

416
00:38:32,749 --> 00:38:35,000
Do you know a Marshal Rooster Cogburn?

417
00:38:35,167 --> 00:38:40,672
Most people know Rooster Cogburn, and some live to regret it.

418
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:45,552
I wouldn't be surprised to learn he's a relative of yours!

419
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,817
- Morning. - Good morning.

420
00:38:59,027 --> 00:39:03,948
- Where's Mr Cogburn? - Sleep late. Very drunk last night.

421
00:39:18,757 --> 00:39:23,970
I've never seen anybody in bed at 10 a.m. Who wasn't sick.

422
00:39:26,222 --> 00:39:28,223
Coffee.

423
00:39:38,778 --> 00:39:42,239
You ain't such an early bird yourself!

424
00:39:42,574 --> 00:39:45,618
I almost gave up on you, figured you'd gone home.

425
00:39:45,744 --> 00:39:51,124
- You need more slats in that bed. - Ain't no slats in it at all.

426
00:39:51,249 --> 00:39:57,880
Some kind of a Chinese rope bed torture contraption, I'd burn...

427
00:39:58,007 --> 00:40:00,216
You got it! How much is there?

428
00:40:00,551 --> 00:40:02,009
You still game?

429
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:06,056
I was born game, and I intend to go out that way.

430
00:40:06,266 --> 00:40:11,062
All right, one understanding: We leave this afternoon to get him.

431
00:40:11,188 --> 00:40:13,314
- You're not going! - You misjudge me.

432
00:40:13,608 --> 00:40:19,613
I can't go up against Pepper's gang, looking after a baby at the same time!

433
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:24,242
- I'm not a baby. - There's no hot grub or warm beds.

434
00:40:24,619 --> 00:40:27,579
I've slept out at night before while hunting coons.

435
00:40:27,789 --> 00:40:31,333
This ain't no coon- hunt. It's no place for a kid.

436
00:40:31,627 --> 00:40:35,588
- They said that about coon- hunting. - You'll be calling for Mama!

437
00:40:35,756 --> 00:40:37,632
I've left off crying.

438
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:42,929
Make up your mind. If you're not game, I'll find somebody who is.

439
00:40:43,097 --> 00:40:46,141
I know you can drink whisky, and I saw you kill a rat,

440
00:40:46,309 --> 00:40:50,938
but all the rest has been talk, and I'm not paying for talk.

441
00:40:51,106 --> 00:40:57,069
- I ought to paddle your rump! - How do you propose to do that?

442
00:40:57,196 --> 00:41:00,949
If I smelled as bad as you, I wouldn't live near people!

443
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:04,369
I've made up a short agreement between us.

444
00:41:04,663 --> 00:41:06,080
Sign it.

445
00:41:07,123 --> 00:41:08,665
Here's $25.

446
00:41:11,377 --> 00:41:16,965
I'll give you another $25 when we leave and $50 when the job is done.

447
00:41:18,886 --> 00:41:21,721
We can get started at first light.

448
00:41:21,847 --> 00:41:26,684
We'll cross the ferry and talk to an informer in the Indian Nation.

449
00:41:26,853 --> 00:41:28,895
He might know something.

450
00:41:29,022 --> 00:41:32,024
I'll be more than ready.

451
00:41:35,069 --> 00:41:36,819
Well, General...

452
00:41:38,156 --> 00:41:40,198
Look what we got.

453
00:42:05,018 --> 00:42:07,352
There's an old saw that says:

454
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:10,064
"One white foot, buy him,"

455
00:42:10,233 --> 00:42:12,776
"two white feet, try him,"

456
00:42:12,902 --> 00:42:15,403
"three white feet, be on the sly,"

457
00:42:15,739 --> 00:42:18,240
"four white feet, pass him by."

458
00:42:20,243 --> 00:42:23,036
But I don't hold with that.

459
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:50,900
I just heard that a young girl fell head first into a fifty- foot well.

460
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:54,696
I thought perhaps it was you.

461
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,739
No, it was not I.

462
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:59,075
What do you hear from the soap man?

463
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:03,747
- Nothing. - I'll take one of the ponies.

464
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:07,960
The black one with the white stockings. I'll call him Little Blackie.

465
00:43:08,129 --> 00:43:11,840
- What is your offer? - The market price.

466
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:14,383
The soap man offered you $10 a head...

467
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:19,890
That is a lot price. I paid you $25 a head only this morning.

468
00:43:20,016 --> 00:43:22,809
- That was the price then. - Tell me this...

469
00:43:22,977 --> 00:43:26,980
Do you entertain plans of ever leaving this city?

470
00:43:27,149 --> 00:43:30,735
Yes, I'm off early tomorrow morning for the Indian Nation.

471
00:43:30,861 --> 00:43:34,363
Marshal Cogburn and I are going after the murderer Tom Chaney.

472
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:36,407
Cogburn...

473
00:43:36,533 --> 00:43:40,453
How did you light on that greasy vagabond?

474
00:43:41,205 --> 00:43:43,456
They say he has grit.

475
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:47,920
- I wanted a man with grit. - I suppose he has that.

476
00:43:48,046 --> 00:43:52,508
He's a notorious thumper. Not a man I would care to share a bed with.

477
00:43:52,843 --> 00:43:56,262
- Nor would I. - I wouldn't trust him too much.

478
00:43:56,389 --> 00:44:00,767
I paid a token payment. The balance is paid when the job's done.

479
00:44:00,893 --> 00:44:04,354
It may prove to be a long, hard journey.

480
00:44:04,522 --> 00:44:07,232
A Christian does not flinch from these difficulties.

481
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:13,321
Neither does he rashly court them. He is not wilful or presumptuous.

482
00:44:13,532 --> 00:44:18,244
- You think I'm wrong? - I think you are wrong- headed.

483
00:44:19,956 --> 00:44:22,833
I'll pay $12 for that pony...

484
00:44:23,042 --> 00:44:28,171
...if you shoe him for me. I will not ride a barefoot pony.

485
00:44:34,387 --> 00:44:36,346
- Good morning. - Good morning!

486
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:41,894
Howdy!

487
00:44:42,063 --> 00:44:45,482
- What are you doing here? - Having a chat with the marshal.

488
00:44:45,859 --> 00:44:48,235
Sit down, sis, have some taffy.

489
00:44:48,403 --> 00:44:53,991
This jaybird says he's on the track of the same man.

490
00:44:54,117 --> 00:44:58,120
I told him we're not interested. He's gone behind my back.

491
00:44:58,914 --> 00:45:04,419
A fella that carries a big- bore carbine might come in handy,

492
00:45:04,587 --> 00:45:08,089
if we get jumped by elephants or buffalo!

493
00:45:08,257 --> 00:45:10,425
We don't need him.

494
00:45:10,593 --> 00:45:12,886
- Everything ready? - All but the grub.

495
00:45:13,096 --> 00:45:15,222
I must have the wrong man.

496
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:20,478
- You let little girls hooraw you? - Mind repeating that, jaybird?

497
00:45:20,604 --> 00:45:23,105
The marshal's working for me.

498
00:45:23,273 --> 00:45:25,232
- How much is she paying you? - Enough.

499
00:45:25,401 --> 00:45:28,445
Is she paying you $500?

500
00:45:29,447 --> 00:45:30,613
No.

501
00:45:30,948 --> 00:45:35,118
That's what the Governor of Texas is paying on conviction of Chaney.

502
00:45:35,287 --> 00:45:39,415
$500? Very little for a man who's killed a senator.

503
00:45:39,583 --> 00:45:42,501
Bibbs was a little senator.

504
00:45:42,627 --> 00:45:44,669
I guess I'll just stick with sis.

505
00:45:44,963 --> 00:45:49,091
The Bibbs family's put up another $1,500 for Chaney.

506
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:53,513
- What are the terms? - Just deliver Chaney, alive or dead.

507
00:45:53,639 --> 00:45:58,393
That's more to my liking. How will you split up the money?

508
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:04,150
If we take him alive, I'll split the $1,500 and keep the state's $500.

509
00:46:04,318 --> 00:46:07,403
If we kill him, I'll give you $500 of the Bibbs' money.

510
00:46:07,529 --> 00:46:10,447
I don't want Chaney taken back to Texas.

511
00:46:10,616 --> 00:46:15,078
- He wants him punished, so do you. - I want him to hang for my father.

512
00:46:15,204 --> 00:46:18,122
I don't care about senators in Texas.

513
00:46:18,291 --> 00:46:24,213
You can tell him to his face. You can make him eat sand.

514
00:46:24,339 --> 00:46:28,968
You can shoot him in the foot, but first we gotta catch him!

515
00:46:29,095 --> 00:46:34,099
- You can't have it all your own way. - I've paid for it so I'll have it my way.

516
00:46:34,308 --> 00:46:36,642
I don't understand at all.

517
00:46:36,977 --> 00:46:40,980
She ain't going anyhow. Go home to your mama.

518
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:44,484
- I told her she could go. - No. She'll make trouble.

519
00:46:44,694 --> 00:46:49,156
Maybe I'll catch this Chaney by myself and take all the money.

520
00:46:49,325 --> 00:46:53,370
You might deliver him, but I'd see you didn't collect a thing.

521
00:46:53,538 --> 00:46:57,499
- How'd you do that? - I'd dispute your claim.

522
00:46:57,708 --> 00:46:59,625
Do that, and I'll kill you.

523
00:46:59,752 --> 00:47:03,755
Don't count on shading someone you don't know, fella.

524
00:47:05,216 --> 00:47:10,137
I ain't seen no one from Texas I couldn't shade!

525
00:47:10,264 --> 00:47:15,101
La Beef, you cross me and you'd think a thousand bricks had fell on you.

526
00:47:15,227 --> 00:47:17,603
You'll wish you was back at the Alamo!

527
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:22,400
Knock him down, Rooster! That reward's just La Beef's talk.

528
00:47:22,568 --> 00:47:26,279
I've given you good cash. He'll cheat you!

529
00:47:26,406 --> 00:47:29,700
A fella's gotta think about himself sometimes, sister.

530
00:47:30,035 --> 00:47:33,120
We'll get your man, that's the main thing.

531
00:47:33,247 --> 00:47:37,125
Give me my $25 back. Hand it over!

532
00:47:38,753 --> 00:47:40,545
I spent it.

533
00:47:42,757 --> 00:47:46,677
- You sorry piece of trash. - I'll get it for you.

534
00:47:47,053 --> 00:47:50,097
If you think you can cheat me, you're mistaken.

535
00:47:50,264 --> 00:47:52,640
You may well hear from my lawyer!

536
00:48:00,401 --> 00:48:03,361
Lawyer? What lawyer?

537
00:48:03,529 --> 00:48:06,656
Don't worry about him. Worry about our business at hand.

538
00:48:52,207 --> 00:48:54,249
- Red. - Morning.

539
00:48:54,459 --> 00:48:58,295
- River looks kind of high. - It's been raining up- country.

540
00:48:58,505 --> 00:49:04,302
- Who are you looking for this time? - If I told you, you might tell him.

541
00:49:11,811 --> 00:49:15,147
Well... you're well enough armed.

542
00:49:15,273 --> 00:49:17,566
I'd say, "Tom Chaney, look out!"

543
00:49:20,195 --> 00:49:25,449
Can't you get anything through your head? You're not going!

544
00:49:33,501 --> 00:49:37,629
Forget about the freight and take us across.

545
00:49:39,507 --> 00:49:41,675
You're not getting on this ferry!

546
00:49:41,843 --> 00:49:45,345
This is open to the public. I've paid my 10 cents.

547
00:49:45,514 --> 00:49:48,391
Take this girl to the sheriff. She's a runaway.

548
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:51,352
- There's a $50 reward. - That's a big story!

549
00:49:51,562 --> 00:49:54,939
- Ask the marshal. - She's a runaway all right.

550
00:49:55,232 --> 00:49:59,235
- Bound to be paper on her. - They're in this together.

551
00:49:59,403 --> 00:50:04,532
I've got business across the river. If you stop me, I'll see you in court!

552
00:50:04,743 --> 00:50:07,286
I've got a good lawyer.

553
00:50:12,585 --> 00:50:17,714
- Lawyer Daggett again. - She draws him like a gun!

554
00:50:28,769 --> 00:50:31,354
I will not walk up that hill!

555
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:36,192
I'm not going to let $50 slide. Get on that horse.

556
00:50:41,449 --> 00:50:43,575
Wait a minute.

557
00:50:43,743 --> 00:50:46,203
I ought to fix my hat.

558
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,444
By God!

559
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:57,989
She reminds me of me!

560
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:01,074
Then we might just not get along.

561
00:52:50,087 --> 00:52:53,548
Well, you were a little slow getting across.

562
00:52:53,674 --> 00:52:58,052
- I said you weren't going. Go back! - I'll do no such thing!

563
00:52:58,888 --> 00:53:00,764
La Beef...

564
00:53:18,784 --> 00:53:21,369
Those horses can't get away from Little Blackie.

565
00:53:21,579 --> 00:53:24,789
They're loaded down with fat men and iron.

566
00:54:10,632 --> 00:54:13,801
Now we'll see what tune you sing!

567
00:54:20,017 --> 00:54:24,646
- I'll raise welts on you like worms! - See what good it does you.

568
00:54:24,773 --> 00:54:27,691
You're not hurting me. I'm just mad!

569
00:54:27,859 --> 00:54:33,489
- Are you gonna let him do this? - I don't believe I will. Drop the switch!

570
00:54:34,866 --> 00:54:37,826
Put it down. You're enjoying it too much.

571
00:54:38,037 --> 00:54:40,830
I go ahead with what I start.

572
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:46,253
You do, and it'll be the biggest mistake you ever made!

573
00:54:47,505 --> 00:54:51,508
You've taken her part all along, but you ain't doing her no kindness.

574
00:54:51,718 --> 00:54:54,178
Just leave her alone.

575
00:55:01,562 --> 00:55:03,187
This has given me a plan.

576
00:55:03,564 --> 00:55:08,151
When we locate Chaney, we can jump him this way and knock him out.

577
00:55:08,278 --> 00:55:11,196
Then we can tie him up and take him back alive.

578
00:55:11,531 --> 00:55:14,950
- What do you think? - You don't want to know what I think.

579
00:55:15,077 --> 00:55:17,537
Get on your horse.

580
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:19,872
It's not dinnertime?

581
00:55:20,081 --> 00:55:26,086
Dinnertime'll come and go without notice on this trip. Get on your horse.

582
00:56:13,973 --> 00:56:16,766
Presbyterian, huh? Southern or Cumberland?

583
00:56:16,934 --> 00:56:19,769
- Southern. - My folks are Cumberland.

584
00:56:20,647 --> 00:56:25,985
- I was raised in the Episcopal Church. - I figured you for a kneeler!

585
00:56:31,242 --> 00:56:33,118
What did you learn?

586
00:56:33,327 --> 00:56:37,956
Ned was sighted at McAlester's store about three days ago.

587
00:56:38,166 --> 00:56:42,378
He goes there from time to time to see a lewd woman.

588
00:56:42,671 --> 00:56:47,759
A thief named Haze is with him and a Mexican on a round- bellied pony.

589
00:56:47,885 --> 00:56:54,099
Chaney wasn't seen, but he was in on that mail hijacking job.

590
00:56:54,225 --> 00:56:56,184
Stew?

591
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:24,632
- This is worse than a pig trail! - Shortest way to McAlester's.

592
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:28,301
- How far is it? - Around 60 miles.

593
00:57:28,636 --> 00:57:32,180
We'll make 15 today and get an early start tomorrow.

594
00:57:33,225 --> 00:57:35,393
How do you like this coon- hunt?

595
00:57:35,686 --> 00:57:38,855
Don't be looking around for me. I'll be right here.

596
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:47,782
You look like a hog on ice!

597
00:57:47,908 --> 00:57:50,076
The bucket's heavy.

598
00:57:50,243 --> 00:57:53,704
I'm stronger than I look.

599
00:57:53,872 --> 00:57:56,957
- What did you bring to eat? - Salt.

600
00:57:57,084 --> 00:57:59,252
Red pepper.

601
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:01,087
Taffy.

602
00:58:02,924 --> 00:58:06,301
- Carry those in your pockets? - Yeah. Along with...

603
00:58:06,428 --> 00:58:09,096
...cartridges and skinning knife.

604
00:58:10,098 --> 00:58:13,058
- What are those things? - Corn dodgers.

605
00:58:14,269 --> 00:58:19,940
- How many have you got in there? - It must be 175.

606
00:58:20,109 --> 00:58:21,901
I can scarcely credit that.

607
00:58:22,111 --> 00:58:27,908
Chen Lee must've thought it was for a wagonload of marshals.

608
00:58:31,204 --> 00:58:32,913
That tastes like iron.

609
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,875
You're lucky to be where water's so handy.

610
00:58:36,001 --> 00:58:40,046
I've drunk out of a filthy hoofprint, and I was glad to get it.

611
00:58:40,964 --> 00:58:45,342
If ever I meet one of you Texans who ain't drunk from a hoofprint,

612
00:58:45,469 --> 00:58:51,724
I'll shake their hand or buy them a Daniel Webster cigar!

613
00:58:51,893 --> 00:58:56,939
How long you boys down there been mounted on sheep?

614
00:58:57,149 --> 00:59:01,069
Have your little joke, but I'll tell you one thing:

615
00:59:01,278 --> 00:59:06,240
That little fella'll still be running when your big stud is collapsed.

616
00:59:06,450 --> 00:59:08,242
Sheep!

617
00:59:13,041 --> 00:59:16,877
That fire's a little big if we're going to pass unnoticed.

618
00:59:17,003 --> 00:59:19,463
Small fire is Ranger policy.

619
00:59:22,051 --> 00:59:24,302
Listen, I have an idea.

620
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:27,806
I'll tell you the story of the Midnight Caller.

621
00:59:27,932 --> 00:59:30,850
One of you plays the caller, I'll tell you what to say,

622
00:59:31,018 --> 00:59:33,102
and I'll play all the other parts.

623
00:59:33,229 --> 00:59:36,898
Fine. Go ahead and tell it.

624
00:59:37,567 --> 00:59:41,487
- I'll tell it if you stop drinking. - Let it go.

625
00:59:41,822 --> 00:59:45,283
That, baby sister, is no trade.

626
01:00:16,463 --> 01:00:19,423
At least Little Blackie likes the corn dodgers.

627
01:00:19,591 --> 01:00:22,051
It's the salt in them.

628
01:00:28,810 --> 01:00:31,812
We won't get to McAlester's by dark.

629
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:35,774
We'd better head for an empty dugout I know.

630
01:00:35,984 --> 01:00:40,112
- We can eat your turkey there. - How? It's all ripped up.

631
01:00:40,406 --> 01:00:43,074
Yeah, pretty chewed.

632
01:00:43,201 --> 01:00:45,160
Too much gun!

633
01:02:02,785 --> 01:02:05,829
I thought you said it would be empty.

634
01:02:26,728 --> 01:02:30,022
Who are you? What do you want?

635
01:02:30,148 --> 01:02:34,818
- We're looking for a place to sleep. - There's no room for you here.

636
01:02:51,004 --> 01:02:53,922
Try that on the chimney.

637
01:03:51,653 --> 01:03:55,656
I'm a federal officer! Speak up, who's in there?

638
01:03:55,824 --> 01:03:58,659
None of your damn business. Keep riding!

639
01:03:58,827 --> 01:04:02,663
- Is that Emmett Quincy? - We don't know Emmett Quincy.

640
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:07,168
Emmett, this is Rooster! I got five more marshals out here.

641
01:04:07,294 --> 01:04:10,630
- We got a bucket of coal oil! - Drink it!

642
01:04:10,756 --> 01:04:13,299
One more minute and you're gonna drink it!

643
01:04:13,635 --> 01:04:18,305
Chuck your guns out and follow them with your hands high!

644
01:04:18,432 --> 01:04:23,228
If that coal oil goes down the chimney, we'll kill everyone that comes out!

645
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:26,314
There's no five marshals out there.

646
01:04:28,026 --> 01:04:33,114
- Don't you bet your life on it! - Moon can't walk, he's hit.

647
01:04:33,239 --> 01:04:36,992
- Drag him out. - What papers you got on me?

648
01:04:37,118 --> 01:04:40,078
I got no papers on you. You better move!

649
01:04:40,247 --> 01:04:45,168
Tell those others to be careful with their guns. We're coming out!

650
01:04:49,674 --> 01:04:52,676
Hit the dirt! Belly down!

651
01:04:52,844 --> 01:04:54,469
Spreadeagle!

652
01:05:08,277 --> 01:05:11,070
I forgot they were there.

653
01:05:11,197 --> 01:05:14,699
Get inside, both of you.

654
01:05:24,419 --> 01:05:27,087
Wrap that around your leg.

655
01:05:29,299 --> 01:05:31,967
Put the horses in the lean- to.

656
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:41,770
- Cuff them. - Get up.

657
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:48,193
Sit down. Get down there.

658
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:50,779
You fellas are way too jumpy.

659
01:05:50,906 --> 01:05:53,824
What have you been up to, besides stealing stock?

660
01:05:53,993 --> 01:05:58,997
- You ain't got no papers on us. - No, but I got some John Does.

661
01:05:59,165 --> 01:06:02,209
Resisting a federal officer, that's a year right there!

662
01:06:02,377 --> 01:06:05,921
- My leg hurts! - I bet it does, sonny boy.

663
01:06:06,048 --> 01:06:09,968
You sit still so it won't bleed so bad.

664
01:06:10,093 --> 01:06:14,263
- When did you last see Pepper? - I don't remember any Pepper.

665
01:06:14,389 --> 01:06:18,017
Short, feisty fella, nervous, with a messed- up lower lip.

666
01:06:18,185 --> 01:06:20,853
That don't bring nobody to mind. A funny lip?

667
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:23,815
It wasn't always like that. I shot him in it.

668
01:06:23,983 --> 01:06:26,109
The lower lip? What was you aiming at?

669
01:06:26,236 --> 01:06:27,778
His upper lip!

670
01:06:27,946 --> 01:06:32,032
Ned's got a new boy with him, a black mark on his face.

671
01:06:32,201 --> 01:06:35,161
That don't bring nobody to mind either.

672
01:06:35,287 --> 01:06:39,457
- You don't know anything, do you? - If I did, I wouldn't blow.

673
01:06:39,583 --> 01:06:40,958
How about you?

674
01:06:41,085 --> 01:06:44,921
I always help the law, if it don't harm my friends.

675
01:06:45,047 --> 01:06:51,136
Pretty good idea, otherwise I'll turn you in at Fort Smith.

676
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:55,600
By that time your leg'll be swollen up tighter than Dick's hatband!

677
01:06:55,893 --> 01:06:57,977
Mortified and they'll cut it off.

678
01:06:58,145 --> 01:07:02,565
If you live, I'll get you 3 or 4 years in a penitentiary.

679
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:08,905
- You're trying to get at me. - If you talk, I'll take you to McAlester's.

680
01:07:09,073 --> 01:07:12,450
They'll get that ball out of your leg, and I'll give you...

681
01:07:12,577 --> 01:07:15,871
...2 or 3 days to get out of the territory.

682
01:07:15,998 --> 01:07:17,874
Moon, I'll do the talking!

683
01:07:18,042 --> 01:07:22,504
Listen to him, you'll lose your leg or your life.

684
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:28,051
- Quincy ain't hurting. - He ain't got nothing on us.

685
01:07:31,305 --> 01:07:35,558
- Been looking around. Six horses. - What kind of horses?

686
01:07:35,894 --> 01:07:38,270
Right good mounts. All shod.

687
01:07:38,397 --> 01:07:41,858
- They're waiting for somebody. - You don't say!

688
01:07:41,984 --> 01:07:47,238
If you won't talk, you can keep busy. Cut that up for frying.

689
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:03,588
What are you looking at? Who are you?

690
01:08:03,924 --> 01:08:07,301
I'm Mattie Ross of Yell County.

691
01:08:07,470 --> 01:08:09,471
What's she doing here?

692
01:08:09,639 --> 01:08:11,932
She's after the man that killed her father.

693
01:08:12,058 --> 01:08:17,104
His name is Chaney, a whisky drinker like you. It led to killing in the end.

694
01:08:17,271 --> 01:08:21,900
Answer the marshal's questions, he'll help you. My lawyer'll help, too.

695
01:08:22,027 --> 01:08:24,695
Don't jaw with these people, Moon.

696
01:08:24,988 --> 01:08:28,949
- I don't like the way you look. - Talking to me, runt?

697
01:08:29,118 --> 01:08:32,245
And I don't like the way you're cutting up that turkey.

698
01:08:32,413 --> 01:08:37,918
- He's making a mess of that turkey! - Do it right, or you'll eat the feathers.

699
01:08:38,086 --> 01:08:40,712
I hope you go to jail.

700
01:08:41,047 --> 01:08:44,049
Shame a kid like Moon losing his leg.

701
01:08:44,175 --> 01:08:47,427
Too young to be hopping around on a willow peg.

702
01:08:47,554 --> 01:08:51,015
Loves to dance too much and sports.

703
01:08:51,141 --> 01:08:54,518
- You're trying to get at me again. - With the truth!

704
01:08:55,396 --> 01:08:58,481
- We saw Ned two days ago... - You go on, I'll kill you!

705
01:08:58,650 --> 01:09:02,987
Quincy, I got to have a doctor. I'll tell what I know.

706
01:09:09,327 --> 01:09:12,579
Lord, I'm gonna die! Help me.

707
01:09:13,415 --> 01:09:16,000
I can't do a thing for you.

708
01:09:16,168 --> 01:09:20,046
Your partner's killed you, and I've done for him.

709
01:09:20,214 --> 01:09:24,551
- Don't let the wolves get me! - I'll see you get buried.

710
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:27,512
Where's Ned Pepper?

711
01:09:27,681 --> 01:09:33,644
They're gonna rob the Katy Flyer. They're coming here for remounts.

712
01:09:33,979 --> 01:09:36,689
See a fella with a powder burn on his face?

713
01:09:36,982 --> 01:09:39,567
No. My brother...

714
01:09:40,278 --> 01:09:45,115
...George Garrett, Methodist circuit rider out of Austin, Texas.

715
01:09:45,241 --> 01:09:47,784
When's Pepper due here?

716
01:09:49,246 --> 01:09:53,708
Sell my traps and send the money to my brother.

717
01:09:54,043 --> 01:09:56,294
Shall we tell your brother what happened?

718
01:09:56,420 --> 01:09:59,505
It doesn't matter. He knows.

719
01:10:00,549 --> 01:10:04,260
I'll meet him later, walking the streets of glory.

720
01:10:04,428 --> 01:10:06,721
Don't expect to see Quincy there.

721
01:10:07,056 --> 01:10:08,640
Quincy?

722
01:10:09,726 --> 01:10:14,230
He never played me false until he killed me.

723
01:10:14,398 --> 01:10:17,275
Let me have a cool drink of water.

724
01:10:28,579 --> 01:10:32,248
It felt as though I still had fingers there.

725
01:10:54,315 --> 01:10:56,483
Let me have that.

726
01:10:56,651 --> 01:10:59,653
- It's one of Papa's gold pieces. - You sure?

727
01:10:59,822 --> 01:11:04,117
It was minted in California. It's worth over $36.

728
01:11:04,285 --> 01:11:06,661
Grandpa gave Papa two when he married.

729
01:11:06,788 --> 01:11:12,126
- Looks like we're on Chaney's trail. - At least we're on Ned's.

730
01:11:12,293 --> 01:11:16,630
Gimme the key to these cuffs. Now go saddle the horses.

731
01:11:16,756 --> 01:11:19,758
Moon said they were coming here. You aim to run?

732
01:11:20,802 --> 01:11:26,140
I aim to do what I came here to do. Saddle the horses.

733
01:11:29,479 --> 01:11:32,147
Straighten up the place.

734
01:12:07,769 --> 01:12:11,146
Take your horse and find a position over there.

735
01:12:11,273 --> 01:12:14,191
I'll be on this side. Don't shoot unless I do.

736
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:16,611
We want them in that dugout.

737
01:12:16,738 --> 01:12:20,240
I'll shoot the last man in the door and we'll have them.

738
01:12:20,367 --> 01:12:26,205
- You'll shoot him without a call? - Then he'll know we're serious.

739
01:12:26,372 --> 01:12:31,209
I'll holler down after I shoot, see if anyone wants to be taken alive.

740
01:12:31,378 --> 01:12:33,712
But when they won't, we'll shoot them!

741
01:12:33,881 --> 01:12:36,799
- I want Chaney alive. - So does the Governor of Texas.

742
01:12:36,926 --> 01:12:40,637
All I know is there's a lot of them and only two of us.

743
01:12:40,805 --> 01:12:43,682
Why don't I nick Chaney before he gets inside?

744
01:12:43,809 --> 01:12:47,270
Any shooting before they get inside, and they'll break.

745
01:12:47,396 --> 01:12:49,814
We're apt to come up with an empty sack.

746
01:12:49,982 --> 01:12:52,859
All right, but if they break, I'll nick Chaney.

747
01:12:52,984 --> 01:12:56,236
If you hit Chaney with your rifle, you'll kill him!

748
01:12:56,405 --> 01:12:58,906
- Remember the turkey! - Yeah.

749
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:02,786
You go after Ned, I'll take care of Chaney.

750
01:13:02,954 --> 01:13:07,583
- What does Ned look like? - Short, feisty, doing all the talking.

751
01:13:07,751 --> 01:13:11,712
- Where does she go? - I go where Rooster goes.

752
01:14:13,488 --> 01:14:16,281
Stay here and keep the horses quiet.

753
01:14:16,408 --> 01:14:21,370
- I can't see anything from over there. - You've seen enough killing today.

754
01:14:21,497 --> 01:14:24,833
I'm not staying by myself. Wait, I'll get my revolver.

755
01:14:25,001 --> 01:14:26,585
What for?

756
01:14:26,711 --> 01:14:29,796
So you can shoot your own foot off?

757
01:15:03,417 --> 01:15:06,043
Why do you keep that one chamber empty?

758
01:15:06,378 --> 01:15:09,088
So I won't shoot my foot off!

759
01:15:11,092 --> 01:15:16,722
- Corn dodger? - Light a match and let me see it first.

760
01:15:16,890 --> 01:15:20,059
- What for? - Some have got blood on them.

761
01:15:20,853 --> 01:15:23,730
We ain't lighting no matches.

762
01:15:23,855 --> 01:15:26,398
I don't want any.

763
01:15:30,613 --> 01:15:32,947
What did you do before this?

764
01:15:33,115 --> 01:15:36,659
Just about everything... except keep school.

765
01:15:36,786 --> 01:15:41,081
- How did you lose your eye? - It was in the war.

766
01:15:41,416 --> 01:15:44,668
The Lone Jack, a scrap outside Kansas City.

767
01:15:44,795 --> 01:15:47,755
What did you do after the war?

768
01:15:47,922 --> 01:15:53,635
I robbed a paymaster, went to Illinois and bought an eating place,

769
01:15:53,804 --> 01:15:55,763
married a grass widow.

770
01:15:56,974 --> 01:15:59,475
The place had a billiard table.

771
01:15:59,602 --> 01:16:03,772
- You never told me you had a wife. - I didn't have her long.

772
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:06,608
My friends were a pack of river rats,

773
01:16:06,777 --> 01:16:09,946
and she didn't crave their society.

774
01:16:10,114 --> 01:16:17,913
She upped and left me and went back to her first husband in Paducah.

775
01:16:18,038 --> 01:16:23,543
"Goodbye, Reuben," she says, "the love of decency ain't in you."

776
01:16:23,670 --> 01:16:28,507
That's a divorced woman talking for you about decency.

777
01:16:28,675 --> 01:16:32,928
I told her, "Goodbye, Nola."

778
01:16:33,055 --> 01:16:37,475
"I hope that bastard makes you happy this time."

779
01:16:39,186 --> 01:16:42,522
Did you have any children?

780
01:16:42,690 --> 01:16:45,650
There was a boy, Nola took him with her.

781
01:16:47,862 --> 01:16:50,572
He never liked me anyway.

782
01:16:51,533 --> 01:16:55,035
A clumsier child you'll never see than Horace.

783
01:16:55,204 --> 01:16:57,163
I bet he broke forty cups!

784
01:16:58,791 --> 01:17:02,252
Never did get you for stealing that money?

785
01:17:02,586 --> 01:17:05,755
- I didn't consider it stealing. - It didn't belong to you.

786
01:17:05,881 --> 01:17:10,718
I needed a road stake. Like that bank in New Mexico.

787
01:17:10,845 --> 01:17:12,971
I needed a road stake, and there it was.

788
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:16,726
I never robbed no citizen or took a man's watch!

789
01:17:16,894 --> 01:17:18,978
It's all stealing.

790
01:17:19,105 --> 01:17:24,151
That's the position those New Mexicans took. I had to flee for my life!

791
01:17:24,277 --> 01:17:29,573
Bo was a young colt then, no horse could run him into the ground.

792
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:32,200
When that posse thinned out,

793
01:17:32,535 --> 01:17:37,247
I turned Bo around and, taking the reins in my teeth,

794
01:17:37,541 --> 01:17:42,045
charged them boys firing two Navy Sixes.

795
01:17:42,213 --> 01:17:45,924
They must have been married men who loved their families,

796
01:17:46,092 --> 01:17:49,636
'cause they scattered and ran for home!

797
01:17:50,597 --> 01:17:54,934
You don't have any family, do you? Except Chen Lee and that lazy cat.

798
01:17:55,059 --> 01:18:00,230
General Price don't belong to me. Cats don't belong to nobody!

799
01:18:00,565 --> 01:18:05,027
He just rooms with me. Course I depend on him...

800
01:18:05,863 --> 01:18:07,739
Well...

801
01:18:07,907 --> 01:18:11,868
Baby sister, you better try and get some sleep.

802
01:18:12,037 --> 01:18:15,581
I'll wake you up when they get here.

803
01:18:47,074 --> 01:18:48,282
Shh!

804
01:18:49,368 --> 01:18:52,996
Looks like Moon was telling the truth.

805
01:19:40,006 --> 01:19:44,092
- What are they doing? - Smelling around.

806
01:19:44,219 --> 01:19:46,845
You see Chaney?

807
01:19:49,183 --> 01:19:51,643
I can't make out their faces.

808
01:19:51,769 --> 01:19:54,687
That's Ned Pepper, all right.

809
01:20:25,721 --> 01:20:29,098
Quincy! Moon!

810
01:20:29,267 --> 01:20:31,727
That's him hollering.

811
01:20:31,895 --> 01:20:35,773
That's the original Mexican Bob with him.

812
01:20:36,775 --> 01:20:39,860
- There's more than one? - There's a younger one.

813
01:20:39,987 --> 01:20:42,405
But he ain't a patch to this one.

814
01:20:42,740 --> 01:20:44,407
Moon!

815
01:20:45,368 --> 01:20:47,285
Quincy!

816
01:20:55,170 --> 01:20:57,129
Now he's done it!

817
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:38,007
Over here, Ned!

818
01:21:41,469 --> 01:21:43,219
I'm hit.

819
01:21:56,862 --> 01:21:59,572
They don't call him Lucky Ned Pepper for nothing.

820
01:21:59,907 --> 01:22:02,951
That man gave his life for him. He didn't even look back.

821
01:22:03,159 --> 01:22:07,329
Looking back is a bad habit.

822
01:22:07,497 --> 01:22:09,164
Well...

823
01:22:21,013 --> 01:22:22,430
What's your story?

824
01:22:22,598 --> 01:22:27,143
I was on the move to a better place, and I heard the first shot.

825
01:22:27,269 --> 01:22:29,520
More likely asleep!

826
01:22:31,190 --> 01:22:36,194
- You know who they are? - The one on the sand spit's Haze.

827
01:22:42,619 --> 01:22:46,205
The boy? I don't know.

828
01:22:47,249 --> 01:22:49,583
He's not much older than I am.

829
01:22:54,381 --> 01:22:57,299
That's nothing but a little scratch.

830
01:22:59,136 --> 01:23:03,556
That's nothing to do with you. Go make us some coffee!

831
01:23:03,850 --> 01:23:08,020
- It won't take long. - Let it go and go on inside!

832
01:23:08,146 --> 01:23:11,607
Why are you being so foolish?

833
01:23:19,658 --> 01:23:24,370
- You're quite a horse- shooter. - I was trying for Ned Pepper.

834
01:23:24,497 --> 01:23:27,457
Next time try for the horse and maybe you'll hit Pepper!

835
01:23:27,625 --> 01:23:29,959
What are we waiting for? Let's ride after them.

836
01:23:30,128 --> 01:23:33,380
I say no. I know where they're going to earth.

837
01:23:33,507 --> 01:23:37,051
You can't take men by watching them run away.

838
01:23:37,219 --> 01:23:40,137
I know this country, and I know these men.

839
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:43,434
We'll take the horses and the dead into McAlester,

840
01:23:43,601 --> 01:23:48,063
and I'll put in a claim for any reward the railroad may offer.

841
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:52,609
- You backed up? - Some... for now.

842
01:24:12,549 --> 01:24:17,637
- Damn a man that whistles! - He's keeping his mind off his hand.

843
01:24:17,971 --> 01:24:20,180
You don't think very much of me, do you?

844
01:24:20,349 --> 01:24:23,935
I don't think about you at all, if you keep quiet.

845
01:24:24,103 --> 01:24:29,983
I was told that you rode with Quantrell and that border trash.

846
01:24:30,110 --> 01:24:34,322
I heard Quantrell and his men weren't soldiers but murdering thieves.

847
01:24:34,489 --> 01:24:37,115
I heard the same thing.

848
01:24:37,242 --> 01:24:39,660
I heard they murdered women and children.

849
01:24:39,995 --> 01:24:42,538
I heard that, too, and it's a damn lie.

850
01:24:42,664 --> 01:24:45,416
What outfit were you with during the war?

851
01:24:45,543 --> 01:24:50,380
- Shreveport, with Kirby Smith. - I mean what side were you on?

852
01:24:50,548 --> 01:24:53,258
I served with General Kirby Smith.

853
01:24:53,385 --> 01:24:56,011
I don't have to hang my head when I say it.

854
01:24:56,180 --> 01:24:59,682
Go ahead, make me look foolish in her eyes.

855
01:25:00,016 --> 01:25:02,559
You don't need me for that.

856
01:25:02,728 --> 01:25:05,438
I don't like the way you make conversation.

857
01:25:05,564 --> 01:25:08,566
I don't like your conversation about Captain Quantrell.

858
01:25:08,692 --> 01:25:13,029
Captain? Captain of what? A bunch of thieves?

859
01:25:13,156 --> 01:25:17,660
Young fella, if you're looking for trouble, I'll accommodate you.

860
01:25:17,995 --> 01:25:20,580
Otherwise... leave it alone.

861
01:25:20,706 --> 01:25:22,707
I've been thinking about Pepper.

862
01:25:23,042 --> 01:25:26,586
Maybe he'd have murdered those two so they wouldn't inform on him.

863
01:25:26,753 --> 01:25:29,338
- Ned wouldn't do that. - Why not?

864
01:25:29,506 --> 01:25:33,008
He doesn't kill people for no reason.

865
01:25:33,135 --> 01:25:37,055
Had he a reason, he'd kill them.

866
01:25:47,735 --> 01:25:52,072
Looks like we might joggle some of our passengers off.

867
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:54,782
Well, they're past hurting.

868
01:26:15,305 --> 01:26:20,476
- We'll tie up here, if you don't mind? - Sure, marshal, you've quite a load.

869
01:26:20,645 --> 01:26:25,107
Yeah... about half the load I was looking for.

870
01:26:25,275 --> 01:26:28,569
Go in and meet Mrs McAlester, she'll fix some dinner.

871
01:26:28,695 --> 01:26:31,697
- I want a word with the peace officer. - I'll go, too.

872
01:26:31,824 --> 01:26:36,411
I'll tell the wife to fix something for all of you.

873
01:26:36,537 --> 01:26:42,083
You go inside, maybe Mrs McAlester can fix that poor little hand of yours!

874
01:26:42,209 --> 01:26:45,211
My poor little hand can keep.

875
01:27:06,819 --> 01:27:09,362
Rooster! What are you doing here?

876
01:27:09,531 --> 01:27:11,156
Boots! Gaspargo!

877
01:27:11,324 --> 01:27:14,159
You're letting that Indian behind you with a blade?

878
01:27:14,286 --> 01:27:18,915
- 'Cause I'm an Indian. - Plenty of scalps on Indian belts!

879
01:27:19,834 --> 01:27:22,794
If you're after Ned Pepper, you're on a cold trail here.

880
01:27:23,171 --> 01:27:27,841
We're looking for another man, too. Black mark on his face.

881
01:27:28,176 --> 01:27:32,846
- We think he's running with Ned. - That's a Texan peace officer!

882
01:27:33,181 --> 01:27:35,307
Ned passed through a couple of days ago.

883
01:27:35,433 --> 01:27:38,727
Him, Haze, Mexican Bob. Only those three were seen.

884
01:27:38,896 --> 01:27:44,192
- I know where Ned's holed up. - You'll need 100 marshals to get him!

885
01:27:44,318 --> 01:27:46,819
My name is Mattie Ross from Yell County.

886
01:27:46,946 --> 01:27:51,366
That man with the black mark killed my father. He's called Chaney.

887
01:27:51,535 --> 01:27:55,872
I got Haze and some youngster outside with Moon and Quincy.

888
01:27:56,164 --> 01:27:58,665
I want you to bury 'em for me. I'm in a hurry.

889
01:27:58,834 --> 01:28:00,793
They're dead?

890
01:28:00,961 --> 01:28:05,423
I wouldn't want you to bury them if they weren't!

891
01:28:05,591 --> 01:28:10,387
- What about La Beef's hand? - Gaspargo's a good doctor, too.

892
01:28:10,555 --> 01:28:12,806
- Take care of it. - It can wait.

893
01:28:12,933 --> 01:28:19,439
- You're no good use if handicapped. - And small use if he ain't!

894
01:28:20,523 --> 01:28:22,399
- Wash first. - Why?

895
01:28:22,526 --> 01:28:25,903
- Don't you wash before you eat? - Ain't gonna eat his hand.

896
01:28:26,238 --> 01:28:28,948
- Don't you know about germs? - No...

897
01:28:29,241 --> 01:28:32,827
Go wash, Gaspargo. You lost!

898
01:28:44,633 --> 01:28:46,425
That's Moon.

899
01:28:52,391 --> 01:28:54,559
Quincy.

900
01:28:57,439 --> 01:29:00,900
Haze! First time he ever stayed shot!

901
01:29:05,656 --> 01:29:10,243
I know this boy. Billy Walsh. Comes from a good family.

902
01:29:10,369 --> 01:29:14,747
Hold good Billy for his folks and bury the rest of them.

903
01:29:14,874 --> 01:29:18,627
I'll post their names. If anyone wants them, they can dig them up.

904
01:29:18,795 --> 01:29:24,717
Sell their horses, coats, guns and saddles, and I'll split it with you.

905
01:29:24,843 --> 01:29:28,012
You told Moon you'd send money to his brother.

906
01:29:28,347 --> 01:29:33,893
- I forget where to send it. - The Methodist church, Austin.

907
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:37,314
Are you sure it was Austin and not Dallas?

908
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:40,358
You know it was Austin!

909
01:29:40,485 --> 01:29:42,402
Write it out for the captain.

910
01:29:42,570 --> 01:29:46,990
Boots, send this man $10 and tell him he's buried here.

911
01:29:47,284 --> 01:29:50,870
I'll do that. So this man shot Ned Pepper's horse?

912
01:29:50,996 --> 01:29:55,541
Yeah, this is the famous horse- killer from El Paso!

913
01:29:55,710 --> 01:30:00,005
He believes in putting everybody afoot. Less mischief that way.

914
01:30:00,339 --> 01:30:02,340
Fewer horses, fewer horse- thieves!

915
01:30:02,508 --> 01:30:04,509
How's your hand?

916
01:30:04,677 --> 01:30:06,928
Both rifle and hand are ready to shoot again.

917
01:30:07,055 --> 01:30:09,681
Straighter than before, I hope!

918
01:30:09,850 --> 01:30:11,600
Well, sister!

919
01:30:11,768 --> 01:30:14,561
The time has come for me to ride hard and fast.

920
01:30:14,730 --> 01:30:18,900
You stay here with the McAlesters, and I'll be back soon with Chaney.

921
01:30:19,068 --> 01:30:22,028
- You can't get shed of me. - She's come this far.

922
01:30:22,364 --> 01:30:25,449
- It's far enough. - I won't quit when we're so close.

923
01:30:25,575 --> 01:30:29,912
There's something in what she's saying. She's won her spurs.

924
01:30:30,038 --> 01:30:32,122
Let it go. I've said my piece.

925
01:30:32,457 --> 01:30:36,877
- No more talk of "winning spurs"! - I'm going.

926
01:30:37,046 --> 01:30:40,340
Not because you say I can or can't.

927
01:30:40,466 --> 01:30:43,718
I paid good money to be here, and I'm on my own business.

928
01:30:43,887 --> 01:30:47,681
We'll have no more talk about it!

929
01:30:47,808 --> 01:30:50,351
Let's eat!

930
01:31:31,604 --> 01:31:34,397
What are you doing?

931
01:31:34,524 --> 01:31:37,067
Looking for a sign.

932
01:31:37,194 --> 01:31:40,446
You couldn't see it if you saw it!

933
01:31:40,989 --> 01:31:43,657
We'll walk a ways.

934
01:32:19,823 --> 01:32:22,491
You looking for a sign again?

935
01:32:23,661 --> 01:32:25,787
It was Bo.

936
01:32:25,955 --> 01:32:28,164
He put his foot wrong.

937
01:32:28,499 --> 01:32:30,124
He's tired.

938
01:32:32,878 --> 01:32:35,796
This is no grade.

939
01:32:35,923 --> 01:32:40,760
I've freighted iron stoves up harder grades than this.

940
01:32:49,897 --> 01:32:51,814
We'll camp here.

941
01:32:59,949 --> 01:33:01,908
Here...

942
01:33:09,251 --> 01:33:15,715
I was a pretty fair hand with a jerk- line when I was freighting in Colorado.

943
01:33:17,594 --> 01:33:22,848
I worked for a fella that was always down with something.

944
01:33:26,603 --> 01:33:32,608
He was carrying a 21 - foot tapeworm with his business responsibilities.

945
01:33:32,776 --> 01:33:38,030
That aged him! His wife commenced running things.

946
01:33:38,157 --> 01:33:42,577
I wasn't about to work for her, so I told her so.

947
01:33:44,915 --> 01:33:48,125
Women have no generosity.

948
01:33:48,251 --> 01:33:52,212
Lord God, how they hate to pay up!

949
01:33:54,258 --> 01:33:59,220
A man will never work for a woman unless he's got clabber for brains!

950
01:33:59,555 --> 01:34:02,724
What about the $25 I paid you?

951
01:34:03,935 --> 01:34:05,894
What $25?

952
01:34:06,062 --> 01:34:09,731
I will not bandy words with a drunkard!

953
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:13,903
That's real smart. You've done nothing when you've bested a fool.

954
01:34:16,782 --> 01:34:21,327
We have come nearly 50 miles from McAlester's.

955
01:34:21,662 --> 01:34:24,330
We're close to Ned Pepper's camp.

956
01:34:24,665 --> 01:34:27,291
Tomorrow we'll take him.

957
01:35:05,876 --> 01:35:09,837
If we're as close as you say, I don't think you should make a fire.

958
01:35:09,964 --> 01:35:12,132
Nobody asked you.

959
01:35:12,842 --> 01:35:14,634
Where are you going with that canteen?

960
01:35:14,761 --> 01:35:16,887
Wash the sleep off me.

961
01:35:17,055 --> 01:35:20,641
We got no water to spare for that. Just take a drink!

962
01:35:21,685 --> 01:35:24,353
I'd say there's a stream down below.

963
01:35:28,776 --> 01:35:31,319
You wash and you'll get no breakfast!

964
01:35:31,654 --> 01:35:34,197
We'll waste no more time.

965
01:35:34,365 --> 01:35:36,658
Shouldn't one of us go down with her?

966
01:35:36,785 --> 01:35:38,869
It might not be safe.

967
01:35:39,037 --> 01:35:42,164
It's safer for her than whatever she meets...

968
01:35:42,291 --> 01:35:44,333
...man or beast!

969
01:36:49,112 --> 01:36:52,114
I know you. Little Mattie, the bookkeeper.

970
01:36:53,117 --> 01:36:55,451
And I know you, Tom Chaney.

971
01:36:55,786 --> 01:36:59,998
What are you doing? There's no money for you to squeeze here.

972
01:37:01,042 --> 01:37:04,753
- I came to fetch water. - That was not my meaning.

973
01:37:11,011 --> 01:37:14,096
I'm here to take you back to Fort Smith and hang you.

974
01:37:14,223 --> 01:37:17,225
I won't go. How do you like that?

975
01:37:18,352 --> 01:37:22,063
There's a posse of officers up the hill that'll force you to go.

976
01:37:22,232 --> 01:37:27,320
- How many officers? - I'd say 50, and they mean business.

977
01:37:27,487 --> 01:37:30,405
So you just walk right in front of me up that hill.

978
01:37:31,157 --> 01:37:34,075
I think I'll oblige those officers to come after me.

979
01:37:35,454 --> 01:37:38,289
If you refuse, I'll have to shoot you.

980
01:37:38,874 --> 01:37:40,875
Is that so?

981
01:37:41,043 --> 01:37:43,085
You'd better cock your piece.

982
01:37:46,049 --> 01:37:48,967
All the way back until it locks.

983
01:37:50,303 --> 01:37:52,888
I know how to do it.

984
01:37:53,015 --> 01:37:57,477
You're saying you won't go with me of your own free will?

985
01:37:57,811 --> 01:38:02,106
You just got it the other way around. Now you follow me!

986
01:38:11,493 --> 01:38:15,246
- I didn't think you'd do it. - Sis!

987
01:38:15,414 --> 01:38:19,834
- Where are you? - I'm down here. I got Chaney!

988
01:38:20,628 --> 01:38:23,338
I just didn't think you'd do it!

989
01:38:24,590 --> 01:38:26,883
One of my short ribs is broken!

990
01:38:27,051 --> 01:38:30,637
You killed my father, when he was trying to help you.

991
01:38:30,972 --> 01:38:32,973
You're just a piece of trash.

992
01:38:33,099 --> 01:38:37,561
You also killed a senator in Texas, when he was sitting on a porch swing.

993
01:38:38,272 --> 01:38:41,649
Everything happens to me. And now I'm shot by a child!

994
01:38:41,942 --> 01:38:44,568
I'll shoot you again if you don't get up!

995
01:38:44,904 --> 01:38:48,615
My father took you in when you were hungry.

996
01:39:02,131 --> 01:39:05,925
Little busybody! I'll teach you a lesson you'll never forget.

997
01:39:06,052 --> 01:39:08,136
Sis! Sis!

998
01:39:08,304 --> 01:39:10,472
Hurry up! Down here!

999
01:39:17,146 --> 01:39:19,272
Take her and go!

1000
01:39:38,002 --> 01:39:40,128
Up the hill with the horses and don't stop!

1001
01:39:41,381 --> 01:39:43,257
Who holds out there?

1002
01:39:43,383 --> 01:39:47,261
Marshal Rooster Cogburn and fifty other armed officers.

1003
01:39:47,387 --> 01:39:50,973
Tell me another lie and I'll stove in your head!

1004
01:39:53,644 --> 01:39:56,312
The truth! Who's out there?

1005
01:39:56,481 --> 01:40:00,359
Marshal Rooster Cogburn and a Texas Ranger.

1006
01:40:05,490 --> 01:40:07,032
Rooster!

1007
01:40:07,158 --> 01:40:09,159
Rooster, can you hear me?

1008
01:40:09,328 --> 01:40:14,207
You better answer or I'll kill this girl! You know I'll do it!

1009
01:40:14,375 --> 01:40:17,460
You want me to kill her?

1010
01:40:17,628 --> 01:40:20,254
Do what you think is best, Ned!

1011
01:40:20,423 --> 01:40:21,589
Why, you...

1012
01:40:25,429 --> 01:40:28,973
She's nothing to me! Nothing but a runaway!

1013
01:40:29,099 --> 01:40:31,976
You and that ranger get moving double fast!

1014
01:40:32,102 --> 01:40:36,355
If I see you riding over that north ridge, I'll spare the girl.

1015
01:40:36,523 --> 01:40:38,315
You got five minutes!

1016
01:40:39,151 --> 01:40:43,363
- We'll need more than five minutes. - I won't give you any more.

1017
01:40:45,242 --> 01:40:49,287
There'll be a party of marshals coming soon.

1018
01:40:49,413 --> 01:40:54,667
You give me Tom Chaney, and I'll mislead them for six hours.

1019
01:40:54,793 --> 01:40:57,753
Throw in that spitfire of a girl, too.

1020
01:40:58,047 --> 01:41:00,131
Too thin, Rooster, too thin!

1021
01:41:00,549 --> 01:41:02,675
I won't trust you.

1022
01:41:03,010 --> 01:41:06,471
Your five minutes are running. You better move!

1023
01:41:06,598 --> 01:41:11,352
All right, we're moving, but we need more than five minutes.

1024
01:41:15,274 --> 01:41:21,071
I never busted a cap on a woman or nobody under sixteen. But I'll do it.

1025
01:41:21,655 --> 01:41:24,073
I'm Mattie Ross of Yell County.

1026
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:28,078
My family has property. Why am I being treated like this?

1027
01:41:28,246 --> 01:41:33,417
Well, it's enough that you know I'll do what I have to do.

1028
01:41:37,715 --> 01:41:41,343
I saw you shot. Where are your wounds?

1029
01:41:41,511 --> 01:41:45,264
My wounds heal by themselves from inside.

1030
01:41:47,308 --> 01:41:51,645
You and Harold stay here, keep a watch out below.

1031
01:41:51,771 --> 01:41:56,108
Keep this turkeycock quiet or we'll have him for supper.

1032
01:41:57,277 --> 01:41:59,778
Why don't you shut up? !

1033
01:42:04,452 --> 01:42:06,202
Is he simple- minded?

1034
01:42:06,329 --> 01:42:08,872
They're all touched, but Harold's the worst.

1035
01:42:09,164 --> 01:42:13,668
No, their ma's the worst, then his brother. But they're all good shots.

1036
01:42:38,154 --> 01:42:39,529
Get down!

1037
01:42:40,282 --> 01:42:42,450
I'll wring your scrawny neck!

1038
01:42:42,617 --> 01:42:45,911
No, you won't. Go and get those horses saddled!

1039
01:42:46,205 --> 01:42:49,582
Lend him a hand. You sit there and be still.

1040
01:43:02,263 --> 01:43:04,264
Your five minutes is up, they better show.

1041
01:43:04,391 --> 01:43:09,145
- What are you doing here? - Chaney shot my father to death.

1042
01:43:09,271 --> 01:43:11,522
I was told Rooster Cogburn has grit.

1043
01:43:11,649 --> 01:43:14,943
I hired him to go after the murderer. I shot him myself.

1044
01:43:15,236 --> 01:43:19,448
If I'd killed him, I wouldn't be in this fix. My gun misfired.

1045
01:43:19,574 --> 01:43:21,616
Well, they will do it.

1046
01:43:21,785 --> 01:43:24,829
Most girls like to play pretties, but you like guns.

1047
01:43:25,538 --> 01:43:28,790
If I did, I'd have one that worked.

1048
01:43:28,917 --> 01:43:32,253
I'll give them a little more time.

1049
01:43:32,421 --> 01:43:35,882
- Did Rooster waylay us last night? - Yes.

1050
01:43:36,175 --> 01:43:40,595
- Did he take Quincy and Moon? - They're both dead.

1051
01:43:40,764 --> 01:43:44,558
It was terrible to see. Do you need a good lawyer?

1052
01:43:44,726 --> 01:43:47,352
I need a good judge.

1053
01:43:47,478 --> 01:43:51,898
That man called Haze, he's dead, too. And the boy that saved your life.

1054
01:43:52,192 --> 01:43:57,238
I'm happy he did what he did, but he should've looked out for himself.

1055
01:43:57,406 --> 01:44:00,324
That goes for your good friend, Rooster.

1056
01:44:00,493 --> 01:44:01,659
Hey, Ned!

1057
01:44:44,540 --> 01:44:47,041
Rooster Cogburn is no good friend of mine.

1058
01:44:47,335 --> 01:44:49,669
He's a drunken, gabbing fool.

1059
01:44:49,796 --> 01:44:54,717
He led us right into your hands and left me with a gang of cut- throats.

1060
01:44:54,843 --> 01:44:57,428
They call that grit in Fort Smith?

1061
01:44:57,596 --> 01:45:00,723
We call it something else in Yell County.

1062
01:45:07,606 --> 01:45:10,775
I was shot from ambush by one of those officers.

1063
01:45:10,902 --> 01:45:13,737
How can you tell a big story like that?

1064
01:45:13,863 --> 01:45:18,075
We're five men and four horses. Chaney stays. You lost the horse.

1065
01:45:18,368 --> 01:45:21,036
I'll send someone to get you with a fresh mount.

1066
01:45:21,372 --> 01:45:23,748
I'm not staying with Chaney.

1067
01:45:23,875 --> 01:45:26,293
He won't harm you. Understand?

1068
01:45:26,419 --> 01:45:30,881
Rooster gave us six hours if we keep her safe. If you don't...

1069
01:45:31,048 --> 01:45:33,508
...you don't get paid!

1070
01:45:33,676 --> 01:45:35,677
- Let me ride with you, Farrell. - No!

1071
01:45:35,845 --> 01:45:38,013
- How about you, Bob? - No!

1072
01:45:38,348 --> 01:45:40,557
- Harold? - Cock- a- doodle- doo!

1073
01:45:40,684 --> 01:45:45,813
- Do it again, Harold! Do a goat! - Baa! Baa!

1074
01:45:50,653 --> 01:45:53,697
We'll see you tonight at Maw's.

1075
01:46:12,844 --> 01:46:16,764
- What are you doing? - I'm getting water to wash my hands.

1076
01:46:16,890 --> 01:46:19,350
A little smut won't hurt you.

1077
01:46:19,475 --> 01:46:22,894
True. Or else you lot would surely be dead!

1078
01:46:23,021 --> 01:46:25,022
Don't provoke me.

1079
01:46:25,357 --> 01:46:29,861
There's rattlesnakes in that pit, and I'll throw you in it!

1080
01:47:00,854 --> 01:47:06,817
Ned Pepper said if you molest me, he'll not pay you. He's your boss.

1081
01:47:06,944 --> 01:47:11,614
He's no idea of paying me. He left me knowing I'd be caught.

1082
01:47:11,782 --> 01:47:16,119
If you let me go now, I'll keep silent about you for two days.

1083
01:47:16,412 --> 01:47:19,914
I can do better. I can shut you up forever!

1084
01:47:30,219 --> 01:47:32,887
All right, Chaney. That's enough.

1085
01:47:34,181 --> 01:47:35,973
Get your hands up.

1086
01:47:46,111 --> 01:47:48,946
- Get over there. - Everything's against me.

1087
01:47:49,072 --> 01:47:51,990
- You hurt, Mattie? - I'm the one that's hurt!

1088
01:47:52,117 --> 01:47:56,621
- Where's Rooster? - Below, in a place we can watch.

1089
01:47:56,747 --> 01:47:59,499
- Where's Little Blackie? - Rooster's got him.

1090
01:48:00,751 --> 01:48:03,669
Get over there and stay over there.

1091
01:48:07,508 --> 01:48:11,720
Watch out, he said there are snakes in that hole.

1092
01:48:50,763 --> 01:48:52,305
Where's the girl?

1093
01:48:52,640 --> 01:48:57,060
In wonderful health the last I saw her. I don't know now.

1094
01:48:57,229 --> 01:49:00,022
Answer for her now. Where is she?

1095
01:49:00,148 --> 01:49:02,941
Rooster! Make a run for it!

1096
01:49:03,068 --> 01:49:06,028
I got Mattie. Chaney, too!

1097
01:49:08,199 --> 01:49:12,869
Will you give us the road? I have business elsewhere.

1098
01:49:13,038 --> 01:49:16,874
Farrell, you and your brother stand clear.

1099
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:21,086
I got no interest in you today. Stand clear, you won't get hurt.

1100
01:49:21,254 --> 01:49:23,672
Cock- a- doodle- doo!

1101
01:49:24,925 --> 01:49:28,761
You think one on four's a dogfall?

1102
01:49:30,723 --> 01:49:33,349
I mean to kill you in one minute, Ned.

1103
01:49:33,643 --> 01:49:39,314
Or see you hanged at Judge Parker's convenience. Which will it be?

1104
01:49:39,941 --> 01:49:43,777
I call that bold talk for a one- eyed fat man!

1105
01:49:45,072 --> 01:49:48,199
Fill your hand, you son of a bitch!

1106
01:49:55,875 --> 01:49:58,835
- Shoot them! - Too far, moving too fast.

1107
01:50:03,967 --> 01:50:07,344
No grit? Rooster Cogburn? Not much!

1108
01:51:09,204 --> 01:51:11,246
Well, Rooster...

1109
01:51:12,416 --> 01:51:14,125
I'm shot to pieces.

1110
01:51:22,051 --> 01:51:25,428
Hurray for the man from Texas! Some bully shot!

1111
01:51:37,777 --> 01:51:39,861
Damn you, Bo.

1112
01:51:39,987 --> 01:51:44,491
First time you ever give me reason to... cuss you!

1113
01:52:41,303 --> 01:52:42,511
Help me!

1114
01:52:45,975 --> 01:52:48,977
Help me, I'm in the pit!

1115
01:52:51,564 --> 01:52:54,065
There's a snake down here and a skeleton.

1116
01:52:54,192 --> 01:53:00,155
There'll be another one before long. A little spindly one.

1117
01:53:00,323 --> 01:53:02,073
How do you like it?

1118
01:53:02,242 --> 01:53:03,992
Help me. Help me.

1119
01:53:06,955 --> 01:53:09,331
Please help me!

1120
01:53:09,458 --> 01:53:12,418
Are you saying you don't like it?

1121
01:53:22,097 --> 01:53:23,973
Baby sister!

1122
01:53:35,903 --> 01:53:40,281
- Are you down there, sis? - Yes, hurry! I'm in a bad way!

1123
01:53:40,408 --> 01:53:43,160
All right, hold on.

1124
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:55,381
I'm gonna pitch you a rope. Slip it under your arms and tie a knot.

1125
01:53:55,549 --> 01:53:59,177
I can't! I'm caught and my arm is broken.

1126
01:53:59,345 --> 01:54:02,097
There are snakes down here.

1127
01:54:20,534 --> 01:54:22,284
It's in here now!

1128
01:54:47,021 --> 01:54:49,272
Hang on right here.

1129
01:54:59,285 --> 01:55:01,661
When you need a damn Texan, he's dead!

1130
01:55:01,955 --> 01:55:06,917
I ain't dead yet, you bushwacker! Hang on!

1131
01:55:15,260 --> 01:55:17,344
I want Papa's gun.

1132
01:55:23,936 --> 01:55:28,606
- I want the other gold piece, too. - You sure you don't want the snake?

1133
01:55:28,733 --> 01:55:31,526
- No. But I want the gold piece. - Forget it.

1134
01:55:31,652 --> 01:55:33,986
But it's mine and I want it!

1135
01:56:33,136 --> 01:56:38,015
That Texican... saved my neck twice.

1136
01:56:38,141 --> 01:56:40,684
Once after he was dead.

1137
01:56:42,563 --> 01:56:46,733
We'll have to do something about this snakebite in a hurry.

1138
01:57:42,376 --> 01:57:45,336
Hold this arm up, little sister.

1139
01:58:03,524 --> 01:58:07,777
- We can't leave him like this. - I'm the one that's leaving him.

1140
01:58:08,113 --> 01:58:12,158
If I don't get you a doctor, you'll be deader than he is.

1141
01:58:13,660 --> 01:58:18,664
- Little Blackie can't carry us both. - He'll have to. He's all I could catch.

1142
01:58:52,368 --> 01:58:53,868
Stop it!

1143
01:58:54,162 --> 01:58:56,455
We must stop, he's played out!

1144
01:59:01,795 --> 01:59:04,213
Stop it! You're killing him!

1145
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:18,627
Hold it!

1146
02:00:18,795 --> 02:00:21,630
Fling them guns into that creek!

1147
02:00:23,425 --> 02:00:26,343
I'm borrowing this wagon off you.

1148
02:01:15,898 --> 02:01:18,733
Boots! Finch!

1149
02:01:30,413 --> 02:01:31,997
Boots!

1150
02:01:32,749 --> 02:01:34,333
Boots!

1151
02:02:14,169 --> 02:02:17,463
Am I addressing Marshal Reuben J Cogburn?

1152
02:02:17,631 --> 02:02:22,468
You're addressing him, Chen Lee and General Sterling Price.

1153
02:02:22,636 --> 02:02:25,596
Well... I'll not ask which is which.

1154
02:02:26,474 --> 02:02:29,142
But I'll identify myself.

1155
02:02:29,477 --> 02:02:32,479
I am lawyer, J Noble Daggett.

1156
02:02:33,607 --> 02:02:36,442
- I'll be damned! - What?

1157
02:02:36,609 --> 02:02:41,154
Well, you're not... exactly what we expected.

1158
02:02:41,490 --> 02:02:43,658
You're a little... You're shrunk!

1159
02:02:43,784 --> 02:02:45,785
I'll tell you frankly.

1160
02:02:45,953 --> 02:02:50,123
I fully intended to have you jailed, and I'm just the man who could do it.

1161
02:02:50,458 --> 02:02:54,127
But when Mattie told me the straight of the matter, I had second thoughts.

1162
02:02:54,462 --> 02:02:57,631
I still think you showed poor judgement in this affair,

1163
02:02:57,800 --> 02:03:00,677
but you're not the scoundrel I took you for.

1164
02:03:00,802 --> 02:03:05,431
You have my thanks and, with certain reservations, my respect.

1165
02:03:05,641 --> 02:03:08,142
How nice! How is sis?

1166
02:03:10,021 --> 02:03:12,105
Gravely ill, I'm afraid.

1167
02:03:12,440 --> 02:03:15,901
But still able to direct her affairs.

1168
02:03:16,027 --> 02:03:21,824
She commissioned me to pay you the balance of the $75 due.

1169
02:03:23,702 --> 02:03:28,956
- She didn't ask for a receipt, did she? - As a matter of fact, she did.

1170
02:03:30,542 --> 02:03:34,920
You will find that it also covers an additional $200...

1171
02:03:35,047 --> 02:03:37,048
...for saving her life.

1172
02:03:37,217 --> 02:03:39,843
Well, I will be damned!

1173
02:03:40,011 --> 02:03:44,973
She says that when she goes home, she wants you to take her there.

1174
02:03:45,142 --> 02:03:49,687
Poor child does not know how ill she really is.

1175
02:03:49,856 --> 02:03:53,984
Lawyer, J Noble Daggett, are you a betting man?

1176
02:03:54,109 --> 02:03:56,026
On occasion.

1177
02:03:56,195 --> 02:04:02,909
All of this and General Price, that she makes it back to Yell County.

1178
02:04:06,039 --> 02:04:07,915
Oh, no!

1179
02:04:08,083 --> 02:04:10,042
No, sir, no, sir!

1180
02:04:22,932 --> 02:04:26,518
Why didn't you look up La Beef's girl in Waco?

1181
02:04:26,645 --> 02:04:29,271
I did the best I could.

1182
02:04:29,606 --> 02:04:32,232
I took the boy home to be buried in his ranger's suit.

1183
02:04:32,568 --> 02:04:36,196
No girl showed up. I don't believe there was one.

1184
02:04:36,531 --> 02:04:39,032
You were too busy collecting the reward.

1185
02:04:39,159 --> 02:04:44,914
I was just a little busy. They forgot how much the reward was.

1186
02:04:45,081 --> 02:04:50,085
- I had to help them remember. - I can imagine how you did that!

1187
02:04:52,881 --> 02:04:56,091
This is what I wanted you to see.

1188
02:04:56,260 --> 02:04:59,304
Papa's marker was not what was ordered.

1189
02:04:59,639 --> 02:05:03,934
I had to make that fool of a stoneman change it.

1190
02:05:06,938 --> 02:05:10,649
Some day, Mama will be here.

1191
02:05:10,817 --> 02:05:13,902
And my brother and his family over there.

1192
02:05:14,071 --> 02:05:17,573
And that is for my sister and her family.

1193
02:05:18,868 --> 02:05:23,163
And I will be here, on the other side of Papa.

1194
02:05:23,289 --> 02:05:27,042
It's comforting to know where we'll meet eternity.

1195
02:05:30,172 --> 02:05:33,633
I would like you to rest beside me, Rooster.

1196
02:05:35,343 --> 02:05:40,389
Now, sis, that place should be for your family,

1197
02:05:40,683 --> 02:05:43,643
your husband, kids...

1198
02:05:50,235 --> 02:05:54,655
You have no kin. I don't count Chen Lee and the cat.

1199
02:05:54,823 --> 02:05:58,784
Where would you end up? A neglected patch of weeds?

1200
02:05:58,910 --> 02:06:01,954
I might just take you up on that offer, sis.

1201
02:06:02,122 --> 02:06:05,291
Excuse me if I don't try to move in too soon.

1202
02:06:07,128 --> 02:06:10,005
I think it's only right that you have Papa's gun.

1203
02:06:10,173 --> 02:06:14,301
- It might keep you alive. - I'm not so sure about that.

1204
02:06:14,636 --> 02:06:17,304
Almost got you killed when it misfired once!

1205
02:06:17,431 --> 02:06:20,141
Because you loaded it wrong in a state of drunkenness.

1206
02:06:20,267 --> 02:06:23,728
- I ought to get you to show me how. - I will.

1207
02:06:29,068 --> 02:06:33,655
- Trust you to buy another tall horse. - Yeah...

1208
02:06:33,823 --> 02:06:39,369
He's not as game as Bo, but Stonehill says he can jump a four- rail fence!

1209
02:06:39,705 --> 02:06:44,167
You're too old and too fat to be jumping horses!

1210
02:06:46,420 --> 02:06:50,673
Well, come to see a fat old man some time.
