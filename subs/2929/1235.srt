我也想玛姬  还有我爸爸

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,790
会害怕才让我们活到了今天
Being afraid is what's kept us alive.

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,270
不  我们只是苟延残喘
No. It's how we kept breathing.

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,720
我知道格伦逃出来了  也知道他的路线
I know Glenn got out and I know which way he went.

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,160
我要找到他  然后再回来找你们
I'm gonna go get him and I'm gonna come back for you.

是的
Yeah.

31
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,940
你这样漂泊了多久
How long's it been like that for?

32
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,960
我不知道
I don't know.

33
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,590
我之前跟过两队人
I was with one group and another one after that.

34
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,550
他们没撑过来吗  两队都没有吗
They didn't make it? Neither one of them?

35
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,150
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

36
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,410
鲍勃·斯图基
Bob Stookey.

37

你们有营地吗
You people have a camp?

38
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,900
{\an8}瑞克的三个问题

你杀了多少行尸
How many walkers have you killed?

40
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,450
没数过  十几个吧
Haven't kept count. A couple dozen.

41
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,920
你杀了多少人
How many people you kill?

42
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,560
只有一个
Only one.

为什么
Why?

44

她让我动手的
She asked me to.

45
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,170
想和我们一起走吗
Want to come with us?

你们是谁并不重要
It doesn't matter who you are.

50
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,240
真的吗
Really?

51
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,010
是的
Yeah.

放开她
Let go of her!

75
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,130
不  不
No! No!

76
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,380
鲍勃
Bob.

77
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:19,440
没事
It's okay.

78
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,260
它正好咬到了我的绷带
He got me right on the bandage.

79
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,270
疼
Ow! Ow! Ow!

80
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,210
我没说不让你抱
I didn't say stop.

81
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,830
我只是叫疼
I just said ow.

82
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:35,840
我只是叫疼
I just said ow.

83
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,490
-接近了吗  -快了
- Are we close? - Almost done.

84
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:43,680
你怎么知道
How do you know?

85
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,420
到处都有踪迹
The signs are all there.

86
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,810
你要学会辨位
Just got to know how to read 'em.

87
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,670
我们在追踪什么
What are we tracking?

88
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,170
你说啊
You tell me.

89
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,990
是你想学的
You're the one who wanted to learn.

90
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,530
有东西经过了这里
Well, something came through here.

91
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,210
路线弯弯曲曲的
The pattern is all zig-zaggy.

92
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,600
是行尸
It's a walker.

93
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,030
也许是个醉汉
Maybe it's a drunk.

94
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,030
我越来越擅长了
I'm getting good at this.

95
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,890
很快我就不需要你了
Pretty soon I won't need you at all.

96
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,170
是啊  继续追踪吧
Yeah, keep on tracking.

97
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,890
它有一把枪
It's got a gun.

98
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,370
你能动吗
Can you move it?

99
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,730
能
Yeah.

100
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:09,930
准备好了吗
You ready?

101
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,130
我们应该等到雾散
We should wait till the fog clears.

102
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,590
我们已经等了一阵了
We've been waiting a while.

103
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,380
你看见了吗  我们只是幸运而已
You see all this? We got lucky.

104
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,960
我们需要能见度
We need visibility.

105
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,210
我们还剩六发子弹
We've got six bullets left.

106
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,170
她说得对
She's right.

107
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,400
我们按计划行事一直很顺利
We've been doing good following the plan.

108
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,940
现在不能草率
No need to get sloppy now.

109
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:33,690
怎么了
What is it?

110
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,180
坏了
It's broken.

111
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:41,630
我们不需要这个
We don't need it.

112
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,260
太阳东边升起  西边落下
Sun comes up in the east, sets in the west.

113
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,930
白天我们就一直注意它的位置
We'll keep an eye on it in between.

114
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:47,940
我们会没事的
We'll be fine.

115
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,020
我们  能等一会儿吗
Can we-- can we hold up a sec?

116
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,100
你还好吗
You all right?

117
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,020
坐一会儿就好
I just need to sit down.

118
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,780
好的  等等
All right. Hold up.

119
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:17,860
上来
Hop on.

120
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,570
-你说真的吗  -是的
- Are you serious? - Yeah.

121
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,740
我来背你  跳上来
This is a serious piggyback. Jump up.

122
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,270
你比看起来要重
You're heavier than you look.

123
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,560
那里可能还有人
Maybe there are people there.

124
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,080
如果有  我来收拾他们
Yeah, if there are, I'll handle them.

125
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,430
还是有好人的  达里尔
There are still good people, Daryl.

126
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,250
我不认为好人能活下来
I don't think the good ones survive.

127
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:16,580
生于1837年11月12日
卒于1874年12月10日
慈父 

128
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:40,860
那是什么
What's that?

129
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:50,150
{\an8}避难所和社区  
欢迎所有人  抵达就能活命

130
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,680
终点站
Terminus.

131
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,940
我们去兽医院的时候
When we were out on the run to the veterinary college,

132
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,620
在广播上听到过这个信息
we heard a message about this on the radio.

133
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,460
-他们在广播这个吗  -说了什么
- They were broadcasting? - What did it say?

134
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,910
没有听清
Couldn't make it out.

135
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,040
我现在看了这个才明白
I only know because I'm seeing it now.

136
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,990
"抵达就能活命"
"Those who arrive survive."

137
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,090
我们应该去
We should go.

138
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,480
我们不是去找格伦嘛
I thought we were looking for Glenn.

139
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,770
如果他看到这样的牌子
If he saw one of these,

140
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:14,760
就会知道我去这里找他了
he would go looking for me looking for him.

141
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,890
看看这地图  所有路线
Look at this map. All these tracks

142
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,050
都通往同一个地方
from different directions leading to the same place.

143
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,550
太远了
It's far.

144
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,210
况且我们不知道还有没有其它的牌子
And we don't know if there are other signs.

145
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,750
你不会认为只有这一个吧
You don't think this is the only one.

146
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,960
这是我们目前最好的线索了
This is the best lead we've had so far.

147
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,130
上面说是避难所  更值得试一下了
It says sanctuary. That's just another reason to try.

148
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,900
从监狱里逃出来的其他人也可能去那里
Others from the prison could be there.

149
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,760
比如泰尔西
Tyreese.

150
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,330
有些事如果听上去太美好...
If it sounds too good to be true...

151
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,120
也许如果格伦看到这种东西
Maybe if Glenn saw one of these,

152
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,610
他的想法会和我一样
maybe he felt the same way.

153
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,110
他不会的  他有信念  我知道
He wouldn't. He'd believe, I know.

154
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,540
那你想怎样  萨沙
What do you want to do, Sasha?

155
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,190
围着大巴不断绕圈吗
Keep making these circles from the bus?

156
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,040
还是让我们做点别的事
Or are you talking about us starting to do something else?

157
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,220
我们不能分头行动
We're not splitting up.

158
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,530
绝对不能
That can't happen.

159
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,320
你是想投票还是怎样
You want to take a vote or something?

160
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,780
我们不需要投票
We don't need to vote.

161
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:17,040
{\an8}避难所和社区  
欢迎所有人  抵达就能活命

162
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,540
等会儿
Give it a minute.

163
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,050
这儿好干净
It's so clean.

164
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,350
有人在打扫
Someone's been tending to it.

165
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,850
那人也许还在附近
May still be around.

166
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:32,960
把你的脚踝包扎一下
Let's get that ankle wrapped.

167
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,280
看来某人没洋娃娃来玩穿衣游戏了
Looks like somebody ran out of dolls to dress up.

168
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,560
很美好不好
It's beautiful.

169
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,760
不管什么人做的
Whoever did this 

170
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,060
都在乎这些人
cared.

171
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,210
他们希望这些人能有一场葬礼
They wanted these people to get a funeral.

172
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,320
他们还记得这些行尸曾经是人
They remembered these things were people

173
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,580
在一切发生之前
before all this.

174
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,360
他们最后没让环境改变他们
They didn't let it change them in the end.

175
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,980
你不觉得这很美吗
Don't you think that's beautiful?

176
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,370
来吧
Come on.

177
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,890
玛姬在哪里
Where's Maggie? 

178
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,250
去拾柴火了
Getting more firewood.

179
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:29,840
还在流血吗
Still bleeding?

180
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,750
不太流了
Barely.

181
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,040
告诉我...
So tell me... 

182
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,190
告诉你什么
Tell you what?

183
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,720
你觉得我们应该停下来
You think we should stop.

184
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,850
是的
Yeah.

185
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,450
告诉我为什么
Tell me why.

186
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,840
为了活下去
To not die.

187
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,350
你  玛姬  我
You, Maggie, me.

188
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,680
才不是因为这个呢
Yeah, that's not it. 

189
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,550
什么
What?

190
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,410
我觉得你不明白自己为什么想要停下来
I don't think you know why you want to stop.

191
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,170
鲍勃  今早发生的事
Bob, what happened this morning,

192
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,380
是对我们的警告
we get warnings.

193
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,600
我们应付得不错
We did fine.

194
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,110
这是对我们的警告
We get warnings.

195
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,800
下次可能就发生在我们身上了
And the next time it's on us.

196
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,970
格伦可能已经死了
Odds are Glenn is dead.

197
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,740
我们也可能会死
Odds are we will be, too.

198
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,600
这就是现实
That's the reality.

199
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,660
我们只剩六发子弹了  而且你还在流血
We got six bullets and you're still bleeding.

200
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,590
那些轨道会穿过一些城镇
Those tracks, they run through towns.

201
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:42,360
我们在最近的城里找座房子
The first one we see, we find a building,

202
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,380
我们在制高点栖身
some higher ground to set up in. All of us.

203
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,020
这才是我们该做的
That's what we need to do.

204
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,700
也是我们要做的
That's what we're gonna do.

205
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,720
如果能说服她的话
If we can talk her into it.

206
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,090
考虑一下吧
Just think about it.

207
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,760
见鬼
Dang.

208
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,840
你找到什么了吗
You find anything?

209
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,480
花生酱和果酱
Peanut butter and jelly,

210
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,840
无糖汽水  还有猪蹄罐头
diet soda, and pig's feet.

211
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,140
标准的懒汉早午餐
That's a white trash brunch right there.

212
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,780
我觉得挺不错
It all looks good to me.

213
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,430
别  等等
No, hold up.

214
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,120
这些都一尘不染的
Ain't a speck of dust on this.

215
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,230
所以呢
So?

216
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,330
说明是有人刚放进去的
That means somebody just put it here.

217
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,660
这是某人的补给
This is someone's stash.

218
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,270
也许他们还活着
Maybe they're still alive.

219
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,850
好吧  我们就拿一点
All right, we'll take some

220
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,780
然后剩一些  行吗
of it and we'll leave the rest, all right?

221
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:49,980
我就知道
I knew it.

222
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,240
知道什么
Knew what?

223
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,060
就像我之前说的
It's like I said.

224
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,500
还是有好人的
There are still good people.

225
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:59,020
好恶心
Gross.

226
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:04,630
那些猪蹄是我的
Hey, those pig's feet are mine.

The place is nailed up tight.

233
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,440
唯一的入口是前门
The only way in is through the front door.

234
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,820
你在干什么

I thought my singing annoyed you.

241
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,950

{\an8}别为了我冒险
祝好运

鲍勃
Bob.

251
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,830
走吧
Come on. 

252
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,340
她肯定顺着轨道走了
She's got to follow the tracks.

253
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,980
我们还能跟上她
We can still catch up to her.

萨沙
Sasha,

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,260
{\an8}避难所和社区
欢迎所有人  抵达就能活命

257
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,860
自从平安地逃离监狱后  你就一直笑
You have been grinning since we left the prison in one piece.

258
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,610
如果活着让你这么开心
If you're so happy to be alive,

259
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,890
那我们现在为什么要朝黑暗的深处走呢
then why are we walking into the heart of darkness?

260
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,620
这和我活着没关系
It's not about me being alive.

261
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,140
那你知道自己为什么笑么
Do you even know why you're smiling?

262
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,720
当然
Oh, yeah.

263
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,980
因为我没落单
I'm not alone.

264
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,700
失去第一队人后  我落单了
That's how it happened when I lost my first group.

265
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,780
第二队也不例外
And my second group.

266
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:13,210
现在我破了这个记录
I broke that streak.

267
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,110
换做是你  也会笑的
You'd be smiling, too.

268
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:17,990
自我意识真是个好东西
Self-awareness is a beautiful thing.

269
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,670
你哪天也试试
You should try it sometime.

270
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,870
-怎么  不打算上钩吗  -才不
- Oh, you're not going to take the bait? - Nope.

271
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,170
你有时候真跟她一样倔 
You're just as bullheaded as she is sometimes.

272
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,060
你知道吗
You know that?

273
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,390
{\an8}格伦  去终点站  玛姬留

274
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,700
{\an8}格伦  去终点站  玛姬留

275
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:49,620
的确
Yeah.

276
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,330
我正全速前进呢
Going as fast as I can.

277
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,620
得了吧
Forget that.

278
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,130
坐好了
Here you go.

279
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,140
现在好了
All right. 

280
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:07,540
开吃吧
Let's eat.

281
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,990
别动
Stay.

282
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,410
一条该死的狗而已
It's just a damn dog.

283
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,030
过来  孩子
Come here, boy. 

284
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:42,710
它不进来吗
He wouldn't come in?

285
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,480
叫你待着别动
I told you to stay back.

286
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,420
是呀  但你不是说有条狗吗  达里尔
Yeah, but, Daryl, you said there was a dog.

287
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,930
说不定过会儿又跑回来了  走吧
Maybe he'll come back around. Come on.

288
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,640
我睡不着
I'm awake.

289
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,880
我也是
So am I.

290
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:15,540
你看见它了吗
Can you see it?

291
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:17,950
看不到
No.

292
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,680
它这样快一个小时了
Been that way for an hour.

293
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,440
说不定被什么卡住了
Might be stuck on something.

294
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,390
晚上的声音真多
There's a lot of noise at night.

295
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,240
蝉  猫头鹰
Cicadas, owls.

296
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:32,760
我有时候觉得它们阴魂不散
I think sometimes they go in circles.

297
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,290
当我一个人时
Still, when I was out here by myself,

298
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,720
我总是睡不好
I didn't sleep much.

299
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,100
你现在也睡不好
You're not sleeping much now.

300
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,870
你需要康复  你需要睡眠
You've got to heal. You need to sleep.

301
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,230
我可以试试
I can try.

302
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:04,020
试过了
I tried.

303
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,320
鲍勃  我们在这里算是干什么呢
Bob, what the hell are we doing out here?

304
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,900
为什么你认为泰尔西已经死了
Why do you think Tyreese is dead?

305
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,260
-什么  -如果泰尔西活着  他会去终点站
- What? - If Tyreese were alive, he'd go for Terminus.

306
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,520
我知道你很清楚这一点
I know you know that.

307
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,560
所以为什么你认为他死了
So why do you think he's dead?

308
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:37,260
还是说你害怕知道他到底死没死
Or are you just too afraid to find out if he is or not?

309
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,730
目前为止  我都觉得你是我遇到最顽强的人
Up until now, I thought you were the toughest person I ever met.

310
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:49,830
说起来有点怪
Which is kind of weird,

311
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,720
因为你也是最贴心的人
'cause you were the sweetest, too.

312
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,520
说说而已
Just saying.

313
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,860
我要留一张感谢卡
I'm gonna leave a thank-you note.

314
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,040
为什么
Why?

315
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,780
他们回来能看见
For when they come back.

316
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:26,030
如果他们会回来的话
If they come back.

317
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,880
就算他们不回来  我还是想说谢谢
Even if they're not coming back, I still want to say thanks.

318
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:36,040
也许你不用留那个
Maybe you don't have to leave that.

319
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,070
也许我们可以在这里待一阵子
Maybe we stick around here for a while.

320
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,490
如果他们回来了
They come back,

321
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,100
我们可以想办法共处
we'll just make it work.

322
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,970
也许他们有点神经
They may be nuts,

323
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:52,880
但也许一切都会安好
but maybe it'll be all right.

324
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:59,760
所以你觉得还是有好人的
So you do think there are still good people around.

325
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,960
是什么改变了你的想法
What changed your mind?

326
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,800
你懂的
You know.

327
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:14,120
什么
What?

328
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,810
我不知道
I don't know.

329
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:23,790
别哼唧
Don't...

330
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,860
是什么改变了你的想法
What changed your mind?

331
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:46,670
我再给那条狗一次机会
I'm gonna give that mutt one more chance.

332
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,700
贝丝  贝丝
Beth! Beth!

333
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:58,440
快跑
Run!

334
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,170
快跑
Run!

335
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:07,200
贝丝  撬开窗户  拿上你的东西
Beth, pry open a window. Get your shit.

336
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:10,270
我不会离开你
I'm not gonna leave you.

337
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,160
出去  去路上  我去那里找你
Go out. Go up the road. I'll meet you there.

338
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,950
快走
Go!

339
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,990
这边
This way.

340
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,220
贝丝  贝丝
Beth! Beth!

341
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,350
贝丝
Beth!

342
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,390
{\an8}格伦  去终点站  玛姬留

343
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,150
她是沿着轨道走的
She's keeping to the tracks.

344
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:01,860
如果我们加快速度  就能追上她
If we pick up the pace, we'll catch her.

345
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:22,640
鲍勃  那边
Bob, right there.

346
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,830
高且安全
Secure and high up.

347
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,690
我们看看能不能搭个东西接雨水
See if we can set up something to catch the rain.

348
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:33,990
看看能不能在屋顶上走动  去寻找食物
See if we could move from the rooftops to look for food.

349
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,760
没准可以在上面种点什么呢
Maybe even try to grow some up there.

350
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,370
萨沙  我不会停下来的
Sasha, I'm not stopping.

351
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,180
我们就留在这里
We are.

352
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,750
我不会的
I'm not.

353
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:44,620
她自己孤身在外
She's out there alone.

354
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,620
她不想让我们去
She didn't want us to come.

355
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:53,020
她做出了自己的决定
She made her choice for her.

356
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,880
我不在乎
I don't care.

357
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,380
她是一个人
She's alone.

358
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,680
我到监狱的时候  自己想的是
When I got to the prison, I thought to myself,

359
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,490
还要多久  时间在不停流逝
"How long? The clock's ticking.

360
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,030
多久以后  其他人会死
How long until everyone else is dead

361
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,720
又只剩下我自己
and I'm on my own?"

362
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,860
因为我害怕  才发生了不好的事情
Bad things happened 'cause I was scared.

363
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:13,330
有些事未必会发生  我不用害怕
They didn't need to. I didn't need to be afraid.

364
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:16,230
如果我们到了终点站  泰尔西不在那里
Now we get to Terminus and Tyreese isn't there,

365
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,230
并不意味着他死了
it doesn't mean he's dead.

366
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,470
-你不用害怕  -我没有害怕
- You don't need to be afraid. - I am not afraid.

367
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,620
那我们就此分别了
So this is it?

368
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:39,050
不一定非要分开
It doesn't have to be.

369
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,880
是的
That's right.

370
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,370
我要试一试
I'm gonna try something here.

371
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,890
好吧
Well, okay.

372
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,130
你不用这样做
You don't have to do it.

373
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:26,070
你不用再次孤单一人
You don't have to be alone again.

374
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,660
我不会的
I won't be.

375
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,790
玛姬
Maggie?

376
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:11,100
该死
Oh, shit.

377
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,760
鲍勃呢
Where's Bob?

378
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,650
去找你了
Out looking for you.

379
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,170
你怎么在这
Why are you here?

380
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,620
我想找只行尸
I was looking for another walker.

381
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,790
结果碰到了好多
Found more than I wanted.

382
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,130
我躺在那的时候
You know, I was lying there

383
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:16,160
我想起来
and I remembered--

384
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,760
我听见了你在营地说的话
I heard what you said back at the camp.

385
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,300
我听见你说  你认为我们应该
I heard you say you thought we should

386
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,570
留在镇上
be in a town.

387
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:30,180
你还听见我说什么了
What else did you hear me say?

388
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,990
格伦可能已经死了
That odds are Glenn is dead.

389
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,990
我们应该停下来
And we should stop.

390
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:47,260
但是你错了
But you're wrong.

391
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,230
那你为什么还在这
So why are you here?

392
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,310
因为我在等你
'Cause I was waiting for you.

393
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,210
我不会放弃的
I'm not giving up.

394
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,410
但我需要你的帮助
But I need your help.

395
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:13,380
我一个人没法做到
'Cause I can't do it by myself.

396
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,780
就算我赶上鲍勃
And even if I catch up to Bob,

397
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,350
光靠我跟他也做不到
we can't do it alone.

398
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,850
我本以为我不能让你以身犯险
I thought that I couldn't ask you to risk your life.

399
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:29,830
但我可以
But I can.

400
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,560
因为我知道你冒险为的是什么
'Cause I know what you'd be risking it for.

401
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,260
不止是为了格伦
And it isn't just Glenn.

402
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,040
我知道你害怕
I get that you're afraid.

403
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,180
的确
I am.

404
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,310
我害怕
I am afraid.

405
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,610
我们可以到达的
We could get there.

406
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:51,950
我知道
I know.

407
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:00,950
我们去找鲍勃
So let's go get Bob...

408
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,240
然后去避难所吧
and let's get there.

409
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,500
看看这是谁
Well, look it here.

410
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,910
该死  等等
Damn it, hold up!

411
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:39,800
他的背心我要了
I'm claiming the vest.

412
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,830
我喜欢上面的翅膀
I like them wings.

413
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,130
别轻举妄动
Hold up.

414
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,620
弩手
A bowman.

415
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,450
我很敬佩
I respect that.

416
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,090
拿着来复枪的人
See, a man with a rifle,

417
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:08,570
以前可能是摄影师
he could have been some kind of photographer

418
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:10,540
或者足球教练
or soccer coach back in the day.

419
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:13,970
但弩箭手自始至终不会变
But a bowman's a bowman through and through.

420
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,880
你手上拿的多少  150磅张弓力吗
What you got there, 150-pound draw weight?

421
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,540
那东西的速度
I'll be donkey-licked if

422
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,960
绝逼能有每秒三百英尺  
that don't fire at least 300 feet per second.

423
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,410
我一直在找这样的武器
I've been looking for a weapon like that.

424
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:27,400
当然了  最好能多几支箭
Of course, I'd want one with a bit more ammo

425
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:31,150
少点弩机上的污渍
and minus the oblongata stains.

426
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,780
你遇到麻烦了吗  老兄
Get yourself in some trouble, partner?

427
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:38,850
你扣下扳机
You pull that trigger,

428
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:41,880
这些人会把你射穿
these boys are gonna drop you several times over.

429
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,880
你想这样吗
That what you want?

430
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,600
别这样  伙计  自杀多蠢啊
Come on, fella, suicide is stupid.

431
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:50,650
可以伤害别人的话又何必伤害自己呢
Why hurt yourself when you can hurt other people?

432
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,100
我叫乔
Name's Joe.

433
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,510
达里尔
Daryl.

434
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:24,210
{\an9}♪No more time♪

435
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:30,170
{\an9}♪For crying tears♪

436
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:38,470
鲍勃
Bob.

437
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:29,960
{\an8}避难所和社区
欢迎所有人  抵达就能活命

438
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:38,790
{\an8}终点站

439
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:52,470
