Where is Beth!?

00:00:07,909 --> 00:00:09,208
Maggie...

4
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:12,292
I miss Maggie, and my dad.

5
00:00:12,684 --> 00:00:15,506
Being afraid is what's
kept us alive.

6
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,451
No. It's how we kept breathing.

7
00:00:18,682 --> 00:00:20,413
I know Glenn got out
and I know which way he went.

8
00:00:20,568 --> 00:00:23,257
I'm gonna go get him and
I'm gonna come back for you.

- You got point?
- Yeah, I got it.

36
00:03:38,324 --> 00:03:40,192
Hi.

37
00:03:40,193 --> 00:03:42,160
Hello.

38
00:03:42,161 --> 00:03:43,896
<i>Just you out here?</i>

39
00:03:44,898 --> 00:03:46,431
Yeah.

40
00:03:47,867 --> 00:03:50,068
How long's it been
like that for?

41
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:52,771
I don't know.

42
00:03:54,207 --> 00:03:58,443
I was with one group
and another one after that.

43
00:03:58,444 --> 00:04:01,547
They didn't make it?
Neither one of them?

44
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:08,186
What's your name?

45
00:04:08,187 --> 00:04:11,189
Bob Stookey.

46
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,260
You people have a camp?

47
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:20,532
How many walkers
have you killed?

48
00:04:21,951 --> 00:04:25,254
Haven't kept count.
A couple dozen.

49
00:04:25,255 --> 00:04:27,456
How many people you kill?

50
00:04:29,342 --> 00:04:30,876
Only one.

51
00:04:33,212 --> 00:04:34,746
Why?

52
00:04:36,082 --> 00:04:38,083
She asked me to.

53
00:04:41,754 --> 00:04:43,488
Want to come with us?

54
00:04:48,494 --> 00:04:50,462
Yes.

55
00:04:50,463 --> 00:04:52,798
You got any questions for us?

56
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:54,900
No.

57
00:04:54,901 --> 00:04:57,269
It doesn't matter who you are.

58
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,004
Really?

59
00:05:00,606 --> 00:05:03,108
Yeah.

60
00:05:03,109 --> 00:05:05,276
It doesn't matter.

Maggie!

64
00:06:56,503 --> 00:06:58,237
Let go of her!

65
00:06:58,238 --> 00:07:00,239
No! No!

66
00:07:16,106 --> 00:07:18,140
Bob.

67
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:20,393
It's okay.

68
00:07:20,394 --> 00:07:22,895
He got me right on the bandage.

69
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:28,117
Ow.
Ow! Ow! Ow!

70
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,287
I didn't say stop.

71
00:07:31,288 --> 00:07:34,290
I just said ow.

72
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,792
<i>I just said ow.</i>

73
00:07:38,962 --> 00:07:41,947
- Are we close?
- Almost done.

74
00:07:41,948 --> 00:07:43,749
How do you know?

75
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,451
The signs are all there.

76
00:07:45,452 --> 00:07:47,303
Just got to know
how to read 'em.

77
00:07:49,923 --> 00:07:51,474
What are we tracking?

78
00:07:51,475 --> 00:07:54,026
You tell me.

79
00:07:54,027 --> 00:07:56,012
You're the one
who wanted to learn.

80
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:01,984
Well, something
came through here.

81
00:08:01,985 --> 00:08:04,303
<i>The pattern</i>
<i>is all zig-zaggy.</i>

82
00:08:04,304 --> 00:08:07,323
It's a walker.

83
00:08:07,324 --> 00:08:09,308
Maybe it's a drunk.

84
00:08:10,477 --> 00:08:12,978
I'm getting good at this.

85
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:15,164
Pretty soon I won't
need you at all.

86
00:08:15,165 --> 00:08:18,167
Yeah, keep on tracking.

87
00:08:22,322 --> 00:08:24,123
It's got a gun.

88
00:08:59,826 --> 00:09:02,194
Can you move it?

89
00:09:04,664 --> 00:09:06,165
Yeah.

90
00:09:08,552 --> 00:09:09,719
You ready?

91
00:09:11,538 --> 00:09:13,005
We should wait
till the fog clears.

92
00:09:13,006 --> 00:09:14,340
We've been waiting a while.

93
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:17,476
You see all this?
We got lucky.

94
00:09:17,477 --> 00:09:19,545
We need visibility.

95
00:09:19,546 --> 00:09:21,213
<i>We've got six bullets left.</i>

96
00:09:21,214 --> 00:09:22,848
She's right.

97
00:09:22,849 --> 00:09:24,383
We've been doing good
following the plan.

98
00:09:24,384 --> 00:09:25,884
No need to get sloppy now.

99
00:09:32,242 --> 00:09:33,909
What is it?

100
00:09:35,796 --> 00:09:38,064
It's broken.

101
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:41,801
We don't need it.

102
00:09:41,802 --> 00:09:44,203
Sun comes up in the
east, sets in the west.

103
00:09:44,204 --> 00:09:46,972
<i>We'll keep an eye</i>
<i>on it in between.</i>

104
00:09:46,973 --> 00:09:49,241
<i>We'll be fine.</i>

105
00:10:00,604 --> 00:10:02,972
Can we--
can we hold up a sec?

106
00:10:02,973 --> 00:10:04,473
You all right?

107
00:10:04,474 --> 00:10:06,792
I just need to sit down.

108
00:10:09,429 --> 00:10:12,314
All right.
Hold up.

109
00:10:16,436 --> 00:10:18,454
Hop on.

110
00:10:18,455 --> 00:10:20,489
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

111
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,875
This is a serious piggyback.
Jump up.

112
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:28,414
You're heavier than you look.

113
00:10:30,917 --> 00:10:32,668
Maybe there are people there.

114
00:10:32,669 --> 00:10:36,088
Yeah, if there are,
I'll handle them.

115
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,725
There are still
good people, Daryl.

116
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:42,394
I don't think
the good ones survive.

117
00:11:12,945 --> 00:11:16,423
_

118
00:11:39,619 --> 00:11:41,620
What's that?

119
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,464
Terminus.

120
00:11:52,465 --> 00:11:54,900
When we were out on the run
to the veterinary college,

121
00:11:54,901 --> 00:11:56,902
we heard a message
about this on the radio.

122
00:11:56,903 --> 00:11:59,538
- They were broadcasting?
- What did it say?

123
00:11:59,539 --> 00:12:01,140
Couldn't make it out.

124
00:12:01,141 --> 00:12:03,242
I only know because
I'm seeing it now.

125
00:12:03,243 --> 00:12:05,377
"Those who arrive survive."

126
00:12:07,714 --> 00:12:09,698
We should go.

127
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:11,500
I thought we were
looking for Glenn.

128
00:12:11,501 --> 00:12:12,968
If he saw one of these,

129
00:12:12,969 --> 00:12:14,970
he would go looking for me
looking for him.

130
00:12:14,971 --> 00:12:16,839
Look at this map.
All these tracks

131
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,540
from different directions
leading to the same place.

132
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,409
It's far.

133
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,211
And we don't know
if there are other signs.

134
00:12:22,212 --> 00:12:23,779
You don't think
this is the only one.

135
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,682
This is the best lead
we've had so far.

136
00:12:26,683 --> 00:12:29,485
It says sanctuary. That's
just another reason to try.

137
00:12:29,486 --> 00:12:31,720
Others from the prison
could be there. Tyreese.

138
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:33,889
If it sounds too good
to be true...

139
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:37,243
Maybe if Glenn saw one of these,
maybe he felt the same way.

140
00:12:37,244 --> 00:12:40,446
He wouldn't.
He'd believe, I know.

141
00:12:40,447 --> 00:12:42,781
What do you want to do, Sasha?

142
00:12:42,782 --> 00:12:45,417
Keep making these
circles from the bus?

143
00:12:45,418 --> 00:12:47,836
Or are you talking about us
starting to do something else?

144
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:52,641
We're not splitting up.

145
00:12:52,642 --> 00:12:54,143
That can't happen.

146
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:57,646
You want to take
a vote or something?

147
00:13:02,251 --> 00:13:04,853
We don't need to vote.

148
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:14,521
_

149
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,154
Give it a minute.

150
00:13:42,098 --> 00:13:44,399
It's so clean.

151
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,101
Yeah.

152
00:13:46,102 --> 00:13:48,737
Someone's been tending to it.

153
00:13:48,738 --> 00:13:50,939
May still be around.

154
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:33,265
Let's get that ankle wrapped.

155
00:14:39,155 --> 00:14:41,990
Looks like somebody ran
out of dolls to dress up.

156
00:14:41,991 --> 00:14:43,558
It's beautiful.

157
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:47,696
Whoever did this cared.

158
00:14:49,449 --> 00:14:52,618
They wanted these people
to get a funeral.

159
00:14:52,619 --> 00:14:55,454
They remembered
these things were people

160
00:14:55,455 --> 00:14:58,090
before all this.

161
00:14:58,091 --> 00:15:00,759
They didn't let it
change them in the end.

162
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,345
Don't you think
that's beautiful?

163
00:15:08,935 --> 00:15:10,936
Come on.

164
00:15:23,432 --> 00:15:26,151
- Where's Maggie?
- Getting more firewood.

165
00:15:28,154 --> 00:15:30,289
Still bleeding?

166
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,492
Barely.

167
00:15:35,545 --> 00:15:39,047
- So tell me...
- Tell you what?

168
00:15:39,048 --> 00:15:41,950
You think we should stop.

169
00:15:45,288 --> 00:15:46,822
Yeah.

170
00:15:48,091 --> 00:15:50,225
Tell me why.

171
00:15:50,226 --> 00:15:52,027
To not die.

172
00:15:53,396 --> 00:15:56,198
You, Maggie, me.

173
00:15:56,199 --> 00:15:59,134
- Yeah, that's not it.
- What?

174
00:15:59,135 --> 00:16:02,004
I don't think you know
why you want to stop.

175
00:16:02,005 --> 00:16:04,473
Bob, what happened
this morning,

176
00:16:04,474 --> 00:16:06,208
we get warnings.

177
00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:08,243
We did fine.

178
00:16:08,244 --> 00:16:10,078
We get warnings.

179
00:16:11,614 --> 00:16:14,049
And the next time it's on us.

180
00:16:17,587 --> 00:16:20,055
Odds are Glenn is dead.

181
00:16:21,824 --> 00:16:24,593
Odds are we will be, too.

182
00:16:24,594 --> 00:16:27,529
That's the reality.

183
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:30,332
We got six bullets
and you're still bleeding.

184
00:16:35,504 --> 00:16:39,024
Those tracks,
they run through towns.

185
00:16:39,025 --> 00:16:42,311
The first one we see,
we find a building,

186
00:16:42,312 --> 00:16:44,012
some higher ground
to set up in.

187
00:16:44,013 --> 00:16:46,198
All of us.

188
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:47,983
That's what we need to do.

189
00:16:50,036 --> 00:16:51,737
That's what we're gonna do.

190
00:16:51,738 --> 00:16:53,855
If we can talk her into it.

191
00:17:03,132 --> 00:17:05,167
Just think about it.

192
00:17:11,207 --> 00:17:12,557
Dang.

193
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:14,926
You find anything?

194
00:17:17,263 --> 00:17:19,981
Whoa.

195
00:17:19,982 --> 00:17:21,566
Peanut butter and jelly,

196
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:24,353
diet soda, and pig's feet.

197
00:17:24,354 --> 00:17:27,072
That's a white trash
brunch right there.

198
00:17:27,073 --> 00:17:29,608
It all looks good to me.

199
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:31,910
No, hold up.

200
00:17:31,911 --> 00:17:34,112
Ain't a speck of dust on this.

201
00:17:35,448 --> 00:17:37,032
So?

202
00:17:37,033 --> 00:17:39,618
That means somebody
just put it here.

203
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:41,569
This is someone's stash.

204
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:44,122
Maybe they're still alive.

205
00:17:44,123 --> 00:17:47,759
All right, we'll take some of it and
we'll leave the rest, all right?

206
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,744
I knew it.

207
00:17:49,745 --> 00:17:51,296
Knew what?

208
00:17:51,297 --> 00:17:52,964
It's like I said.

209
00:17:52,965 --> 00:17:55,083
There are still good people.

210
00:17:56,585 --> 00:17:59,254
- Mm.
- Gross.

211
00:18:00,973 --> 00:18:04,309

217
00:18:35,558 --> 00:18:37,843
The place is nailed up tight.

218
00:18:43,266 --> 00:18:45,300
The only way in
is through the front door.

219
00:18:50,156 --> 00:18:52,140
What are you doing?

220
00:18:52,141 --> 00:18:55,444
This is the comfiest bed
I've had in years.

221
00:18:55,445 --> 00:18:58,646
- Really?
- I ain't kidding.

222

224
00:19:08,124 --> 00:19:10,658
I thought my singing
annoyed you.

225
00:19:10,659 --> 00:19:13,178

Bob?

233
00:20:07,552 --> 00:20:11,961
_

234
00:20:13,322 --> 00:20:15,357
Bob.

235
00:20:18,727 --> 00:20:21,363
Come on. She's got to
follow the tracks.

236
00:20:21,364 --> 00:20:23,248
We can still catch up to her.

237
00:20:28,204 --> 00:20:31,907
Sasha, we can still
catch up to her.

238
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:42,770
You have been grinning since we
left the prison in one piece.

239
00:21:44,005 --> 00:21:45,506
If you're so happy to be alive,

240
00:21:45,507 --> 00:21:48,309
then why are we walking
into the heart of darkness?

241
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,511
It's not about me being alive.

242
00:21:54,015 --> 00:21:56,317
Do you even know
why you're smiling?

243
00:21:56,318 --> 00:21:58,102
Oh, yeah.

244
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:05,526
I'm not alone.

245
00:22:05,527 --> 00:22:09,113
That's how it happened
when I lost my first group.

246
00:22:09,114 --> 00:22:11,365
And my second group.

247
00:22:11,366 --> 00:22:13,484
I broke that streak.

248
00:22:13,485 --> 00:22:15,953
You'd be smiling, too.

249
00:22:15,954 --> 00:22:18,072
Self-awareness
is a beautiful thing.

250
00:22:18,073 --> 00:22:19,773
You should try it sometime.

251
00:22:22,477 --> 00:22:25,579
- Oh, you're not going to take the bait?
- Nope.

252
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,998
You're just as bullheaded
as she is sometimes.

253
00:22:27,999 --> 00:22:29,633
You know that?

254
00:22:39,686 --> 00:22:42,498
_

255
00:22:47,869 --> 00:22:50,704
Yeah.

256
00:22:50,705 --> 00:22:52,173
<i>Going as fast as I can.</i>

257
00:22:52,174 --> 00:22:53,741
Forget that.

258
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,480
Here you go.

259
00:23:02,501 --> 00:23:04,618
Whew.

260
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:07,371
All right.
Let's eat.

261
00:23:13,845 --> 00:23:15,713
Stay.

262
00:23:26,474 --> 00:23:28,609
It's just a damn dog.

263
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:30,528
Hi.

264
00:23:30,529 --> 00:23:33,280
Come here, boy.

265
00:23:41,156 --> 00:23:42,990
He wouldn't come in?

266
00:23:42,991 --> 00:23:44,491
I told you to stay back.

267
00:23:44,492 --> 00:23:47,878
Yeah, but, Daryl,
you said there was a dog.

268
00:23:49,247 --> 00:23:51,498
Maybe he'll come
back around. Come on.

269
00:24:06,982 --> 00:24:09,266
I'm awake.

270
00:24:09,267 --> 00:24:11,551
So am I.

271
00:24:13,905 --> 00:24:16,156
Can you see it?

272
00:24:16,157 --> 00:24:18,325
No.

273
00:24:18,326 --> 00:24:19,827
Been that way for an hour.

274
00:24:19,828 --> 00:24:21,895
Might be stuck on something.

275
00:24:24,199 --> 00:24:27,001
There's a lot
of noise at night.

276
00:24:27,002 --> 00:24:30,004
Cicadas, owls.

277
00:24:30,005 --> 00:24:32,756
I think sometimes
they go in circles.

278
00:24:34,376 --> 00:24:36,260
Still, when I was
out here by myself,

279
00:24:36,261 --> 00:24:38,095
I didn't sleep much.

280
00:24:38,096 --> 00:24:40,547
You're not sleeping much now.

281
00:24:40,548 --> 00:24:42,967
You've got to heal.
You need to sleep.

282
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:47,688
I can try.

283
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,488
I tried.

284
00:25:10,745 --> 00:25:13,213
Bob, what the hell
are we doing out here?

285
00:25:17,636 --> 00:25:20,054
<i>Why do you think</i>
<i>Tyreese is dead?</i>

286
00:25:24,926 --> 00:25:28,646
- What? <i>- If Tyreese were
alive, he'd go for Terminus.</i>

287
00:25:28,647 --> 00:25:30,797
I know you know that.

288
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:33,734
So why do you think he's dead?

289
00:25:33,735 --> 00:25:37,071
Or are you just too afraid
to find out if he is or not?

290
00:25:41,826 --> 00:25:44,194
Hmm.

291
00:25:44,195 --> 00:25:47,498
Up until now, I thought you were
the toughest person I ever met.

292
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:50,367
Which is kind of weird,

293
00:25:50,368 --> 00:25:53,587
'cause you were
the sweetest, too.

294
00:25:53,588 --> 00:25:55,589
Just saying.

295
00:26:13,475 --> 00:26:15,943
I'm gonna leave
a thank-you note.

296
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:21,014
Why?

297
00:26:21,015 --> 00:26:23,484
For when they come back.

298
00:26:23,485 --> 00:26:26,787
If they come back.

299
00:26:26,788 --> 00:26:29,573
Even if they're not coming back,
I still want to say thanks.

300
00:26:33,795 --> 00:26:36,263
Maybe you don't
have to leave that.

301
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,901
Maybe we stick around
here for a while.

302
00:26:43,104 --> 00:26:45,272
They come back,

303
00:26:45,273 --> 00:26:47,908
we'll just make it work.

304
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:50,010
They may be nuts,

305
00:26:50,011 --> 00:26:53,414
but maybe it'll be all right.

306
00:26:56,084 --> 00:26:59,420
So you do think there are
still good people around.

307
00:27:01,589 --> 00:27:03,791
What changed your mind?

308
00:27:09,464 --> 00:27:11,432
You know.

309
00:27:12,434 --> 00:27:13,667
What?

310
00:27:21,426 --> 00:27:22,926
I don't know.

311
00:27:22,927 --> 00:27:25,712
Don't...

312
00:27:25,713 --> 00:27:27,681
What changed your mind?

313
00:27:35,423 --> 00:27:37,224
Oh.

314
00:27:43,598 --> 00:27:46,766
I'm gonna give that mutt
one more chance.

315
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,290
Beth! Beth!

316
00:27:56,911 --> 00:27:58,912
Run!

317
00:27:58,913 --> 00:28:00,747
Run!

318
00:28:03,618 --> 00:28:06,953
Beth, pry open a window.
Get your shit.

319
00:28:08,122 --> 00:28:10,507
I'm not gonna leave you.

320
00:28:10,508 --> 00:28:12,893
Go out. Go up the road.
I'll meet you there.

321
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:16,263
<i>Go!</i>

322
00:28:18,183 --> 00:28:20,300
This way.

323
00:29:34,726 --> 00:29:37,895
Beth! Beth!

324
00:29:39,931 --> 00:29:41,815
Beth!

325
00:29:56,811 --> 00:29:59,212
She's keeping to the tracks.

326
00:29:59,213 --> 00:30:01,648
If we pick up the pace,
we'll catch her.

327
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:06,669
_

328
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,312
Bob, right there.

329
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:27,033
Secure and high up.

330
00:31:27,034 --> 00:31:30,236
See if we can set up
something to catch the rain.

331
00:31:30,237 --> 00:31:33,523
See if we could move from the
rooftops to look for food.

332
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:35,342
Maybe even try to grow
some up there.

333
00:31:35,343 --> 00:31:38,028
Sasha, I'm not stopping.

334
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,946
We are.

335
00:31:39,947 --> 00:31:42,866
I'm not.

336
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:45,001
She's out there alone.

337
00:31:48,089 --> 00:31:50,707
She didn't want us to come.

338
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,926
She made her choice for her.

339
00:31:52,927 --> 00:31:54,427
I don't care.

340
00:31:54,428 --> 00:31:55,929
She's alone.

341
00:31:57,798 --> 00:32:00,216
When I got to the prison,
I thought to myself,

342
00:32:00,217 --> 00:32:03,019
"How long?
The clock's ticking.

343
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:06,272
How long until everyone else
is dead and I'm on my own?"

344
00:32:06,273 --> 00:32:09,409
Bad things happened
'cause I was scared.

345
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:12,862
They didn't need to.
I didn't need to be afraid.

346
00:32:12,863 --> 00:32:15,782
Now we get to Terminus
and Tyreese isn't there,

347
00:32:15,783 --> 00:32:17,784
it doesn't mean he's dead.

348
00:32:17,785 --> 00:32:21,020
- You don't need to be afraid.
- I am not afraid.

349
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,168
So this is it?

350
00:32:36,637 --> 00:32:38,638
It doesn't have to be.

351
00:32:38,639 --> 00:32:40,890
That's right.

352
00:32:48,715 --> 00:32:50,900
I'm gonna try something here.

353
00:33:15,676 --> 00:33:17,427
Well, okay.

354
00:33:19,046 --> 00:33:20,680
You don't have to do it.

355
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:25,602
You don't have
to be alone again.

356
00:33:32,726 --> 00:33:34,644
I won't be.

357
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:04,344
Maggie?

358
00:36:08,515 --> 00:36:10,633
Oh, shit.

359
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:59,117
Where's Bob?

360
00:36:59,118 --> 00:37:01,336
Out looking for you.

361
00:37:01,337 --> 00:37:04,422
Why are you here?

362
00:37:04,423 --> 00:37:07,325
I was looking
for another walker.

363
00:37:07,326 --> 00:37:09,510
Found more than I wanted.

364
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:13,848
You know, I was lying there

365
00:37:13,849 --> 00:37:15,884
and I remembered--

366
00:37:15,885 --> 00:37:18,503
I heard what you said
back at the camp.

367
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:23,024
I heard you say
you thought we should

368
00:37:23,025 --> 00:37:25,310
be in a town.

369
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:31,032
What else did you hear me say?

370
00:37:31,033 --> 00:37:34,018
That odds are Glenn is dead.

371
00:37:36,989 --> 00:37:38,957
And we should stop.

372
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,998
But you're wrong.

373
00:37:51,553 --> 00:37:53,972
So why are you here?

374
00:37:59,044 --> 00:38:01,045
'Cause I was waiting for you.

375
00:38:03,766 --> 00:38:05,984
I'm not giving up.

376
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:10,154
But I need your help.

377
00:38:10,155 --> 00:38:13,107
'Cause I can't do it by myself.

378
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,862
And even if I catch up to Bob,

379
00:38:17,863 --> 00:38:19,897
we can't do it alone.

380
00:38:22,835 --> 00:38:26,304
I thought that I couldn't
ask you to risk your life.

381
00:38:28,073 --> 00:38:31,109
But I can.

382
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:33,544
'Cause I know what
you'd be risking it for.

383
00:38:36,649 --> 00:38:38,783
And it isn't just Glenn.

384
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,854
I get that you're afraid.

385
00:38:42,855 --> 00:38:44,822
I am.

386
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:48,126
I am afraid.

387
00:38:49,194 --> 00:38:50,695
We could get there.

388
00:38:50,696 --> 00:38:52,463
I know.

389
00:38:58,904 --> 00:39:00,905
So let's go get Bob...

390
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:05,677
and let's get there.

391
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,861
Well, lookit here.

392
00:39:36,408 --> 00:39:38,192
<i>Damn it, hold up!</i>

393
00:39:38,193 --> 00:39:40,611
I'm claiming the vest.

394
00:39:40,612 --> 00:39:43,081
I like them wings.

395
00:39:43,082 --> 00:39:44,665
Hold up.

396
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,733
A bowman.

397
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,635
I respect that.

398
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:08,222
See, a man with a rifle, he could
have been some kind of photographer

399
00:40:08,223 --> 00:40:10,058
or soccer coach
back in the day.

400
00:40:10,059 --> 00:40:14,145
But a bowman's a bowman
through and through.

401
00:40:14,146 --> 00:40:16,514
What you got there,
150-pound draw weight?

402
00:40:16,515 --> 00:40:20,785
I'll be donkey-licked if that don't
fire at least 300 feet per second.

403
00:40:22,354 --> 00:40:24,489
I've been looking
for a weapon like that.

404
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:27,592
Of course, I'd want one
with a bit more ammo

405
00:40:27,593 --> 00:40:30,561
and minus the oblongata stains.

406
00:40:33,215 --> 00:40:36,384
Get yourself in some
trouble, partner?

407
00:40:36,385 --> 00:40:39,337
You pull that trigger,

408
00:40:39,338 --> 00:40:41,923
these boys are gonna
drop you several times over.

409
00:40:41,924 --> 00:40:44,208
<i>That what you want?</i>

410
00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:47,812
Come on, fella,
suicide is stupid.

411
00:40:47,813 --> 00:40:50,565
Why hurt yourself when you
can hurt other people?

412
00:40:57,523 --> 00:40:59,723
Name's Joe.

413
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:05,079
Daryl.
