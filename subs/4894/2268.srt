34 minutes.

00:02:34,216 --> 00:02:35,641
You're 4 minutes late.
Pizza's free.

4
00:02:36,205 --> 00:02:38,810
C'mon! You guys live two towns away.
It's pretty much impossible to get here in 30 minutes.

5
00:02:38,811 --> 00:02:42,723
Exactly. That's why we ordered
from your shitty Pizza Parlour.

6
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,022
Ok. You guys are pretty smart.

7
00:02:44,024 --> 00:02:46,302
You figured out a way to beat the system.

8
00:02:46,795 --> 00:02:48,340
I'll let you go.
- Thank You!

9
00:02:48,898 --> 00:02:50,457

Sorry, only got the big bills.

11
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,037
You guys kinda remind me of me,
when i was your age, actually.

12
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,143
You know, Kinda like...
try to get drunk any chance I get.

13
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,360
You got...frige full of beers right?

14
00:03:00,635 --> 00:03:01,995
Man, we don't have anything.

15
00:03:01,997 --> 00:03:03,039

16
00:03:03,035 --> 00:03:05,206
- Could you get us some beer?
- Me?

17
00:03:05,755 --> 00:03:10,736
Uhm..Listen..I shouldn't do this..but if you give me the money
that your mom gave you for the pizzas, which you didn't give me,

18
00:03:11,247 --> 00:03:14,797
I will run out and grab you some beers.

00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:19,697

00:04:42,262 --> 00:04:43,453
Hey! What the hell?

00:04:44,002 --> 00:04:45,528
Have you just been sitting there,
watching the whole time?

35
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:49,093
Yep. Caught the whole shill. Really
classy move at the end. By the way, that kiss...

36
00:04:49,293 --> 00:04:52,119
- Look, the woman is kind enought to ride me with fellatio services,

37
00:04:52,597 --> 00:04:54,930
I'm not just gonna,
dart outta there, llike she is an untouchable.

38
00:04:55,272 --> 00:04:57,461
- And they say, Chivalry is dead.

39
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,770
Here, have a beer. The alcohol should help you
wash the taste ofyourself out of your mouth.

40
00:05:01,962 --> 00:05:03,088
- Thank you, sir.

41
00:05:03,852 --> 00:05:05,523

43
00:05:08,817 --> 00:05:09,930
I got uh..Lethal Weapon 2.

44
00:05:10,415 --> 00:05:12,651
- I think, I'll have to pass.
I gotta be up early tommorow. I have a class to teach at 7.

45
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:16,552
- C'mon man, you're a sub.
Just call in sick, like a real teacher do.

46
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:18,540
- Dude, you know I got promoted
to full-time last month, alright.

47
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,485
You boughtme a laser pointer.

48
00:05:20,984 --> 00:05:23,381
I know.I'm just having
trouble accepting you as "the man."

49
00:05:23,383 --> 00:05:24,425
You know, cos you are YOU.

50
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:27,936
Filling kids head with a bunch of bullshit.
Laser pointing at stuff, just so you can have your summers off.

51
00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:32,804
- I'm sorry, I have a career. And that i don't have time
to squeeze action movies into my schedule.

52
00:05:32,806 --> 00:05:33,848
- Okay, Call Of Duty?

53
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:36,332
Fine, but you will get smoked.

54
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,454
- That was sick! Dwayne.
- That was fucking awesome!

55
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:46,648
This one's gonna blow even bigger.

56
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:50,229
- You know, if you weren't such a skinny
little bitch you coulda been in the military.

57
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:53,359
- I don't need the military, dude. I taught myself
how to do this shit. Went online, and looked all this up.

58
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:56,931
- Oh, I hear you. I taught myself how to
eat pussy. And cut my own hair.

59
00:05:57,864 --> 00:05:59,465
- I taught myself, how to eat pussy hair.

60
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,961
- Dude, hey I want this one.

61
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:05,533
- Give me the Cross-bow.

62
00:06:06,063 --> 00:06:07,752
Blow that shit up dude.

63
00:06:07,754 --> 00:06:08,796
This one is mine.

64
00:06:08,798 --> 00:06:09,840
Bin Laden!

65
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:11,937
This time its personal.

66
00:06:12,422 --> 00:06:14,688
Fuck you!

67
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,123
Whoah, man! It's so real!

68
00:06:22,179 --> 00:06:24,677
Run bitch!

69
00:06:24,679 --> 00:06:25,721
Oh, Check this out.

70
00:06:25,323 --> 00:06:26,528
- What are you doing, dude?

71
00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:27,571
Look, I'm not afraid of Jason.

72
00:06:27,573 --> 00:06:30,848
Look at me..
I'm fucking Jason.

73
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:45,679
Who are you two fags fucking?

74
00:06:46,822 --> 00:06:47,968
Just..Jason Vorhese.

75
00:06:48,664 --> 00:06:49,851
Afternoon, Major.

76
00:06:49,853 --> 00:06:50,895
- It's been 20 years, Dwayne.

77
00:06:50,896 --> 00:06:54,040
When are you finally
gonna get the courage, to ask him out?

78
00:06:54,093 --> 00:06:55,229
- Phss..that's not funny.

79
00:06:55,803 --> 00:06:57,333
We are business partners.

80
00:06:58,004 --> 00:06:59,333
- What kind of business are you in?

81
00:07:00,934 --> 00:07:03,606
- Entrever..ss
- entreaver nouss..?

82
00:07:03,607 --> 00:07:06,644
- That's not a business!
You can't even pronounce it.

83
00:07:06,646 --> 00:07:07,688
We're just trying to watch this movie.

84
00:07:08,288 --> 00:07:10,893
About 45 minutes left and  3D tits coming.

85
00:07:10,894 --> 00:07:13,499
You come in at the worst possible time.

86
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:18,168
I bought that TV set so I could watch my football,
not so you and your boy friend could jack off all over it.

87
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:21,532
- Well, then maybe you should learn
how to share the common space, better.

88
00:07:22,138 --> 00:07:23,329
- Common..

89
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,342
The only thing common in this house is you.

90
00:07:27,285 --> 00:07:29,697
- Come on Travis.
This moviesucks anyway.

91
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:31,452
- You look it, Major.

92
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,973
I paid for the damn cold cuts, too.

93
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:38,150
Maybe if you had a job, or a fucking prospect,
or a clue how to get any of the above,

94
00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:40,483
I'd let you eat 'em.

95
00:07:42,036 --> 00:07:43,281
- You are a cold sonofabitch, dad.

96
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:48,938
- That's what it takes, boy. In the Corps,
pussies like you wore dresses to keep us entertained.

97
00:07:49,578 --> 00:07:50,880
That's really fucking disturbing!

98
00:07:53,525 --> 00:07:56,130
Shit! Talking to me about, fucking cold cuts.

99
00:07:56,131 --> 00:07:58,736
That sonofabitch.

100
00:07:58,737 --> 00:08:01,417
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
He bought another new truck.

101
00:08:02,489 --> 00:08:05,094
That's some high end Detail work, Dwayne.

102
00:08:05,096 --> 00:08:07,701
- Fuck the Major.

103
00:08:07,702 --> 00:08:08,744
- Yeah, fuck him dude.

104
00:08:28,816 --> 00:08:31,421
Sorry.

105
00:08:31,423 --> 00:08:33,428
Very funny, but you are late.

106
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,642
- No, I'm 45 minutes late...
which is like...

107
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,007
Ten minutes early for me.

108
00:08:38,008 --> 00:08:39,050
- Where the hell were you?

109
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,462
You live like, two blocks away.

110
00:08:40,823 --> 00:08:44,159
- Yeah, I got held up.
Trying to get the perfect shirt and hat combo for you.

111
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,202
What do you think?

112
00:08:45,204 --> 00:08:47,992
- I like it.
Very minimal wage.

113
00:08:48,192 --> 00:08:49,599
- Thanks, I can't wait to quit and take the shit off.

114
00:08:53,475 --> 00:08:57,783
- Say what you wanna say about your boss.
But the man knows how to make a good pizza.

115
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,167
Did you see Tom Small's Facebook Update?

116
00:09:01,671 --> 00:09:03,738
You know I don't check that shit,
I'm off the grit.

117
00:09:04,514 --> 00:09:05,840
- He came out.

118
00:09:05,841 --> 00:09:06,883
- What?

119
00:09:07,563 --> 00:09:09,729
Even posted a picture of him and his latin boyfriend.

120
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:11,663
Tom Small is gay??

121
00:09:11,948 --> 00:09:14,221
That kid beat the hell out of me and
Chet in grammar school. Wow.

122
00:09:14,258 --> 00:09:14,836
Tell me about it.

123
00:09:15,196 --> 00:09:17,490
He OTPF'd me at Junior High formal.

124
00:09:16,987 --> 00:09:18,194
- What the hell was that?

125
00:09:18,088 --> 00:09:19,874
'Over The Pants Finger'

126
00:09:19,876 --> 00:09:20,918
- That's disgusting.

127
00:09:23,042 --> 00:09:24,598
- So, I've got some news...

128
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:25,641
- Even bigger news than that, Tom Small?

129
00:09:26,555 --> 00:09:27,815
Cos, I don't know if I can take much more news.

130
00:09:28,289 --> 00:09:32,099
- This little Corporation they call 'The Four Seasons'
has decided to finally get their shit together,

131
00:09:32,684 --> 00:09:35,044
And accept me to their management training programme.

132
00:09:35,468 --> 00:09:36,793
- Really? Wow!
Congratulations.

133
00:09:36,794 --> 00:09:38,889
- That's amazing.
- Thank You.

134
00:09:39,023 --> 00:09:41,412
- I just can't believe they're opening a Four-Seasons in town.
We don't even have a Radisson.

135
00:09:42,594 --> 00:09:45,302
- Yeah, exactly. Which is why
I'm moving to Atlanta.

136
00:09:46,048 --> 00:09:47,708
I'm gonna be working in the Special Events Department.

137
00:09:48,231 --> 00:09:49,851
- In Atlanta?

138
00:09:51,867 --> 00:09:55,660
You know, I know a little bit about it,
from Rap Music and It sounds like a fucked up place.

139
00:09:56,623 --> 00:09:59,214
Come on, ....???

140
00:09:59,552 --> 00:10:01,138
Did you tell your brother?

141
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:02,927
- Yeah..Chet was really happy for me.

142
00:10:04,691 --> 00:10:06,255
I thought You'd be happy for me too.

143
00:10:06,705 --> 00:10:08,161
- I am. I am totally happy for you.

144
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:10,392
In fact, i will make you a Crunk CD or something.

145
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,843
I bet you have a hustler friends in Atlanta.

146
00:10:15,718 --> 00:10:18,323
He treats me like a bitch.

147
00:10:18,324 --> 00:10:20,929
That's no way to treat a son.
He thinks he knows me. He doesn't fucking knows me.

148
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,535
I have more ideas than, he could ever dreams of.

149
00:10:23,537 --> 00:10:25,874
I have plans more bigger than his whole fucking house.

150
00:10:26,044 --> 00:10:29,608
Oh...whatever you say.
Maybe, just be quite for a while.

151
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:31,714
Forget about your dad.

152
00:10:32,249 --> 00:10:33,811
Let me do my think.

153
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,929
- I wish I could forget about that Ass-Hole.
As is, I'm pretty much waiting for him to drop dead.

154
00:10:39,903 --> 00:10:42,700
I just don't wanna mess with my inheritance.

155
00:10:43,295 --> 00:10:45,044
- Really? What kind of inheritance?

156
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:46,970
- Well, when the old man left the service,

157
00:10:47,456 --> 00:10:52,891
He started buying lotto tickets, the next think you know..
for ninety eight the dude hits it for ten million dollars.

158
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:58,464
You know, ever since then, he'd been burning through
it like an NBA draft picks. Bought a Winnebago..

159
00:10:59,018 --> 00:11:00,085
Flat screen TV...

160
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,540
Its all that senseless spendings.
He's probably down to one or two million now.

161
00:11:05,549 --> 00:11:08,165
As soon as he kicks it,
All that cash is mine.

162
00:11:09,721 --> 00:11:11,331
- You know,

163
00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:13,682
for a million dollars...

164
00:11:15,156 --> 00:11:16,893
You could have anything.

165
00:11:19,408 --> 00:11:20,470
You'll be like a King.

166
00:11:21,342 --> 00:11:23,947
King Dwayne.

167
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:27,597
- Right On!
and you can be like my Queen.

168
00:11:28,246 --> 00:11:29,982
- and polish my Roll Sceptre.

169
00:11:29,984 --> 00:11:32,158
- I know practice makes perfect.

170
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:34,991
- ohh, fuck you.

171
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,918
- Maybe, I could help get you that money, now.

172
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,962
- Oh yeah?

173
00:11:38,963 --> 00:11:40,005
- Before he spend another penny.

174
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,353
- And how would you do that?

175
00:11:43,462 --> 00:11:44,534
- I know a guy in Detriot.

176
00:11:46,609 --> 00:11:49,618
He could help you.
He'll probably do it for...

177
00:11:50,277 --> 00:11:52,860
A Hundred G.

178
00:11:53,937 --> 00:11:55,101
- Do what?

179
00:11:56,378 --> 00:11:57,921
- Kill your mean old Dad.

180
00:12:00,713 --> 00:12:03,423
So, what do you say?

181
00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:06,938
Are you ready for your Crown?

182
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,939
Uh huh.

183
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,700
Hey, Watch out.

184
00:12:19,325 --> 00:12:22,407
- Hey, you should pace yourself there, buddy.
Its Noon on a Saturday.

185
00:12:22,818 --> 00:12:24,809
Nah, the frige is full man.
We are all good.

186
00:12:24,449 --> 00:12:26,676
Its pretty crazy about Tom Small huh?

187
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:28,394
- Yeah, well.. I never liked him.

188
00:12:29,093 --> 00:12:32,152
Your sister did. You know,
she let him finger blast her? Big time.

189
00:12:33,857 --> 00:12:36,462
- What the fuck are you talking about, man?
I don't want that shit in my head.

190
00:12:36,463 --> 00:12:39,068
- Sorry, your sister told me about it last night,
I thought you should know.

191
00:12:39,069 --> 00:12:41,508
- What? You now swapping stories
about getting fingered?

192
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:46,105
- No, it's just that your sister makes some
questionable decisions. You know, like...

193
00:12:46,781 --> 00:12:48,209
like moving to Atlanta.

194
00:12:48,815 --> 00:12:51,532
- What's wrong with that?
She gets to manage a hotel, I get free rooms...

195
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,684
You can go over there and crash,
whenever you're on streets. We all win!

196
00:12:54,685 --> 00:12:57,290
- Yeah, except her!
Once she gets involved with some Atlanta douchebag,

197
00:12:57,292 --> 00:12:59,897
that's totally wrong for her.
You know, some Doctor...

198
00:12:59,898 --> 00:13:02,673
who drives a white BMW and listens to Phish.
Fucking lame.

199
00:13:03,358 --> 00:13:07,204
- Right, whatever.
Why are you telling me who my sister goes out with?

200
00:13:07,206 --> 00:13:08,248
- I don't know.

201
00:13:13,157 --> 00:13:14,724
- You wanna fuck my sister, don't you?

202
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,735
- Chet, I really don't wanna talk about this, okay.
- Ahhh, my twin sister!

203
00:13:17,736 --> 00:13:20,341
Which is basically, like fucking me???

204
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:22,947
- Your sister is attractive, and she excites me.

205
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:25,704
Yes, in a sexual way.
Can we please be adults about this?

206
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:27,195
- You...an adult?

207
00:13:27,617 --> 00:13:30,408
You had a luchables for dinner last night.

208
00:13:30,863 --> 00:13:32,328
You're a fucking man-child!

209
00:13:32,798 --> 00:13:34,504
Hey, let's not say shit we can't take back..Okay?

210
00:13:34,506 --> 00:13:34,998
How about this?

211
00:13:35,035 --> 00:13:36,214
You wanna know who I saw naked?

212
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:37,257
Who?

213
00:13:37,585 --> 00:13:40,190
Jenny Rifkin.

214
00:13:40,191 --> 00:13:42,796
I was nailing her.
The week after she dumped you.

215
00:13:42,797 --> 00:13:45,402
Intercourse style!
That's right.

216
00:13:45,404 --> 00:13:47,817
My brown hands, all over her nice white tit ass.

217
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:54,174
Wow....  You pulled a Judas on Jenny fucking Rifkin.
That is messed up Chet.

218
00:13:55,022 --> 00:13:56,037
Almost...

219
00:13:56,408 --> 00:14:00,024
as messed up as how I sold your
Willie May signed ball for 200 bucks.

220
00:14:01,085 --> 00:14:04,255
Hey, My grandpa left me that ball in his will!
You helped me look for it for a month!

221
00:14:04,815 --> 00:14:07,159
Now you know why we never found it.
Are we done here?

222
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,855
Not quite yet.

223
00:14:09,998 --> 00:14:12,603
I was the one who told John Tanner
about how your mom fucked that

224
00:14:12,604 --> 00:14:15,209
lifeguard.  And I always felt awful about it,

225
00:14:15,211 --> 00:14:17,816
because even though he swore secrecy,
he wound up telling everyone else in town.

226
00:14:17,817 --> 00:14:20,633
And then your parents got divorced.
But now...I don't give a shit.

227
00:14:21,507 --> 00:14:22,474
Well then!?

228
00:14:23,105 --> 00:14:24,470
You ruined...my whole fucking life!

229
00:14:24,982 --> 00:14:27,199
Not much of a life to ruin but yeah,
I guess i did.

230
00:14:28,627 --> 00:14:29,987
Okay, Chet.

231
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:32,676
You're right.

232
00:14:32,713 --> 00:14:34,157
I do wanna have sex with your sister.

233
00:14:35,101 --> 00:14:36,285
Again.

234
00:14:36,322 --> 00:14:38,293
Because the first time was so awesome.

235
00:14:38,992 --> 00:14:39,662
Bullshit, that never happened.

236
00:14:39,699 --> 00:14:40,923
Graduation night.

237
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,750
- Noo, you fucked Tina Scado.
- No, I just told you I did. Same story,

238
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:47,388
different girl.

239
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,432
- What!

240
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,760
You deflowered my sister,
and i know all the fucking details!

241
00:14:54,146 --> 00:14:56,751
Get the fuck off me!

242
00:14:56,753 --> 00:15:01,376
You're twins, did you feel it when I was fucking her?

243
00:15:01,849 --> 00:15:04,454
Motherfucker!

244
00:15:19,977 --> 00:15:23,847
You're a huge loser.
You're not good enought for my sister. Okay?

245
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,028
You're a pizza boy!

246
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:28,456
You know, I actually feel sorry for you.

247
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:29,843
You're a fucking dick.

248
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:33,264
Cos you'll never understand this shit.
Its way more complicated than your...

249
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:34,979
Online dating.

250
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,022
You're a shit friend.

251
00:15:36,816 --> 00:15:42,007
All those years asking me for stuffs,
favours...you know what, that B gowns is the last favour.

252
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:43,051
You'll ever get.

253
00:15:42,658 --> 00:15:44,219
- Good, That's the last one I'll ever need.

254
00:15:44,825 --> 00:15:47,207
Yeah, i'll give you call on a fucking Matzarella sticks.

255
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:50,287
The pool is so dirty dude.

256
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,537
Where do all these leaves come from?

257
00:15:55,145 --> 00:15:57,004
- Where the hell do you think, dude?
From fucking trees.

258
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,756
- That's what she said.

259
00:16:01,487 --> 00:16:03,454
You know, 'that's what she says' joke don't..

260
00:16:04,053 --> 00:16:05,909
work with that. It has to be something
in a sexual reference.

261
00:16:05,911 --> 00:16:06,953
Like, you know...

262
00:16:07,804 --> 00:16:09,590
'These leaves are hard'.
That's what she said.

263
00:16:15,005 --> 00:16:16,219
I hate this pool.

264
00:16:17,823 --> 00:16:18,814
Dwayne?

265
00:16:18,851 --> 00:16:19,991
What?

266
00:16:19,591 --> 00:16:21,718
Look, I don't wanna get into a family matter...
or anything but uh...

267
00:16:23,668 --> 00:16:24,956
but killing the major seems kinda messed up...

268
00:16:26,294 --> 00:16:27,322
right? or no???

269
00:16:27,324 --> 00:16:29,948
No, it's not messed up.
It's barely even murder.

270
00:16:29,984 --> 00:16:30,766
I mean ...it's

271
00:16:31,242 --> 00:16:34,052
really..just kinda shaving
a few years off The Old man's shitty existence.

272
00:16:34,569 --> 00:16:37,174
Hey, Dipshit!

273
00:16:37,176 --> 00:16:39,781
If my pool ain't ready in an hour,
you don't get paid.

274
00:16:39,782 --> 00:16:42,387
Maybe, you gotta woke your lazy ass up,
before noon.

275
00:16:42,388 --> 00:16:45,764
- I wake up at 11:15 Major.
That's a fact.

276
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:51,640
- You look good.
- Nice to see you too, Dad. Love you... so much.

277
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:53,668
Fuck that dick.

278
00:16:55,373 --> 00:16:56,862
You know why I sleep late, Travis?

279
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:00,588
It's not because I'm lazy.
It's on account of having so many dreams.

280
00:17:00,995 --> 00:17:03,746
Big ones.
Prepare yourself.

281
00:17:04,376 --> 00:17:08,208
What is  the one thing, this town's missing?
I'll give you a hint.

282
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:10,696
It's cash business.

283
00:17:10,247 --> 00:17:11,997
It's crawling with sexy bitches.

284
00:17:12,577 --> 00:17:16,206
- A Chinese food restaurant?

285
00:17:15,997 --> 00:17:17,494
- Abortion clinic?

286
00:17:16,207 --> 00:17:17,249
- No.

287
00:17:18,354 --> 00:17:20,596
-  Yeah...No.  A tanning salon.

288
00:17:21,964 --> 00:17:25,063
Think of alll the green.
All that brown flesh.

289
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:28,522
And, It's the perfect front for a prostitution ring.

290
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:32,518
- And guess what?
- What?

291
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,498
- I'm gonna cut you in on it.

292
00:17:35,886 --> 00:17:37,360
Make you a partner in business.

293
00:17:37,361 --> 00:17:38,403
If...and only 'if'..?

294
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,263
You'll be my partner in crime.

295
00:17:41,223 --> 00:17:42,380
You're gonna be fucking rich and famous..

296
00:17:43,256 --> 00:17:44,621
Helping dudes to calm and get tanned.

297
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:46,936
Or you're gonna be fucking pussy,

298
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:50,104
and clean this asshole's pool
for 10 bucks an hour?

299
00:17:52,545 --> 00:17:54,001
- Yeah, alright.  I'll do it.

300
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,006
But I'm not shoot the Major or anything. Alright?

301
00:17:57,008 --> 00:17:58,050
I'll hold him while you shoot him.
Not that dude.

302
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:02,031
- Nah.. listen, I'm not shooting anybody alright?
You wanna be a millionaire Travis?

303
00:18:02,522 --> 00:18:04,190
You gotta start thinking like one, Okay?

304
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,332
Do you think millionaires murder people?

305
00:18:06,862 --> 00:18:08,374
No..no they don't.

306
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,934
They hire highly trained assassins to do it for them.

307
00:18:10,936 --> 00:18:11,978
Which I've done.

308
00:18:12,722 --> 00:18:13,933
- What?

309
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:17,835
- Dwayne, where are we gonna get a 100 thousand dollars,
to pay this deadly assassins?

310
00:18:17,872 --> 00:18:19,504
- See, now we're getting down to the heart of the matter.

311
00:18:19,609 --> 00:18:20,661
How do we get the 100 Gs?

312
00:18:21,204 --> 00:18:23,809
'Cause once we have the 100 Gs,
We basically have a million.

313
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:28,345
And once we get the million, well then we
own everything and everyone in this whole fucking town.

314
00:18:29,356 --> 00:18:31,961
- Alright, maybe we uh....
rob a bank?

315
00:18:31,963 --> 00:18:36,091
Isn't that what people do? Just go down to the local branch,
shoot some old shit security guard???

316
00:18:36,092 --> 00:18:37,134
We'll be like...

317
00:18:37,269 --> 00:18:40,302
- Not really thinking like a millionaire.

318
00:18:40,814 --> 00:18:43,910
Okay, then maybe we, uhh hire somebody to rob a bank.

319
00:18:44,327 --> 00:18:46,932
- Dude, Fuck hiring them,

320
00:18:46,934 --> 00:18:49,539
Just force some dumb motherfucker,
to rob a bank for us.

321
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,168
So, I film myself banging this dude's wife.

322
00:18:55,263 --> 00:18:59,381
I talk her into doing some degrading shit.. get the neighbourhood
kids over and they're gonna whack off on her face.

323
00:18:59,694 --> 00:19:04,083
And then, we use the tape to blackmail her hausband,
Into robbing the bank.

324
00:19:04,594 --> 00:19:07,075
- That's a great idea, Dwayne.
Really good.

325
00:19:07,899 --> 00:19:13,268
I just think, it might be a little hard to find
a wife that slutty and gross by tuesday.

326
00:19:13,956 --> 00:19:16,386
- Yeah, I guess seduction takes some time,
So, what do we do?

327
00:19:16,387 --> 00:19:19,053
We use political pressure, death threats??

328
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:19,564
- Or A bomb.

329
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,026
Everyone's scared of a bomb, Dwayne.

330
00:19:24,694 --> 00:19:26,195
- I was gonna say hypnotism...but

331
00:19:27,321 --> 00:19:28,613
I like a bomb.

332
00:19:30,074 --> 00:19:32,111
Yeah, that's definitely thinking outside the box.

333
00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:35,444
What would you do? You just like,
stick it to him like we did those watermelons?

334
00:19:35,777 --> 00:19:37,165
- Yes, strap it on Man.

335
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:38,209
- You can do that?

336
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:40,093
- Yeah, camel jockeys do it in caves.

337
00:19:40,094 --> 00:19:43,187
I got a fucking dope ass
garage workshop, in America.

338
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:46,471
- And what I like about this idea is,
this is kinda howa fucking millionaire would do it.

339
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:49,078
we don't lose any sleep over it,
nobody gets hurt.

340
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:50,641
- Except The Major.

341
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:53,473
- The trick is gonna be,
Where do we get our dude?

342
00:19:53,489 --> 00:19:55,011
If we're gonna commit to a kidnapping,

343
00:19:55,709 --> 00:19:57,147
Well, that's just as risky as a murder.

344
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,164
-  That's a good point.

345
00:19:59,624 --> 00:20:01,809
- We'll have to figure a way to bring the dude to us.

346
00:20:01,277 --> 00:20:03,278
Lure him into a situation,
we have total control over.

347
00:20:03,998 --> 00:20:06,468
We also, gotta make sure that
this dude is not connected to us in anyway.

348
00:20:06,469 --> 00:20:07,511
(on TV) And remember...

349
00:20:07,513 --> 00:20:11,138
We'll deliver anywhere in 30 minutes or less!

350
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,104
Or your pizza is free!

351
00:20:13,141 --> 00:20:16,526
Vito's Pizza, where the customer gets what they want...

352
00:20:16,562 --> 00:20:18,849
pronto!

353
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:24,483
Sometimes, fate pulls out its big old cock
and slaps you in the face.

354
00:20:25,078 --> 00:20:28,038
- Yeah.

355
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:32,260
Pizza man: Give me the bag,
not that bag...the other bag.

356
00:20:33,929 --> 00:20:36,534
Hey, i don't mean to interrupt you
curing a cancer here...but uh..

357
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,929
It's time to get back on the street.

358
00:20:38,931 --> 00:20:41,195
- I'm off in ten minutes,
Where the hell is this?

359
00:20:41,232 --> 00:20:43,280
- Let me check my fucking e-mail...

360
00:20:43,854 --> 00:20:47,982
Its in 30 minutes or less lane,
or else, the pizza comes out of your paycheck!

361
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,188
Tic Tock!

362
00:21:46,927 --> 00:21:48,271
Hey, over here buddy!

363
00:21:49,252 --> 00:21:51,309
The City's got us working at the ass end of the night!

364
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:52,353
- Yup, I hear that.

365
00:21:52,525 --> 00:21:54,995
Hey, listen I know i'm probably
like 10..15 minutes late, but uh

366
00:21:59,691 --> 00:22:00,772
That's a great mask.

367
00:22:01,189 --> 00:22:02,372
That's very funny.

368
00:22:02,373 --> 00:22:03,415
So, listen about the whole 30 minutes thing...

369
00:22:03,417 --> 00:22:05,454
are we cool? Cos uh...

370
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:09,122
Oh, another one. The missing link.

371
00:22:09,633 --> 00:22:11,561
That's really nice, I wish
I could get stoned too.

372
00:22:12,151 --> 00:22:14,281
So, which one of the gorilla's handling the cash?

373
00:22:14,283 --> 00:22:15,325
- Get Him!

374
00:22:18,052 --> 00:22:19,266
Escape, is impossible.

375
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:25,395
What the hell!?
Rape!!

376
00:22:34,162 --> 00:22:35,274
Step one.

377
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,448
You thought we were gonna rape you.

378
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:44,622
What an idiot!

379
00:22:46,476 --> 00:22:47,737
Alright, let's see here...

380
00:22:48,489 --> 00:22:53,847
Mr.Nick Davies of 110 North of...
whatever the fuck street.

381
00:22:54,222 --> 00:22:58,746
Right now, you are wearing an explosive bomb vest.

382
00:23:01,593 --> 00:23:07,796
Calm down...calm down.

383
00:23:08,406 --> 00:23:11,011
Just don't do anything like,
trip over your shoelaces or anything.

384
00:23:11,012 --> 00:23:13,617
That vest is packed with C-4.

385
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:15,179
The C is for chaos.

386
00:23:15,181 --> 00:23:16,223
Actually, for "composible."

387
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,266
Don't bump in shit.

388
00:23:18,451 --> 00:23:20,259
Hey wow...
sit down.

389
00:23:20,844 --> 00:23:23,449
Show him your kicks.

390
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:26,055
- Yeah.. check that shit. You wanna pop off?

391
00:23:26,056 --> 00:23:28,281
Look at this.

392
00:23:28,527 --> 00:23:31,774
Fucking stay there!
Or you'll get that right across your god damn face.

393
00:23:33,964 --> 00:23:35,173
So, what do you think?
Pizza boy..

394
00:23:35,778 --> 00:23:37,790
Can we take that tape off?

395
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,402
I'm trusting you now.

396
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:41,262
- Help!

397
00:23:40,897 --> 00:23:44,222
Someone, help him!!!

398
00:23:45,171 --> 00:23:47,776
Where the fuck do you think you are?

399
00:23:47,777 --> 00:23:50,382
You might as well be in outer space, man.

400
00:23:50,384 --> 00:23:52,248
Nobody can fucking hear you scream.

401
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,032
They'd hear you more in space, actually.

402
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:56,440
Not that, you can hear anyone in space.

403
00:23:56,816 --> 00:23:59,234
It's from Alien.

404
00:23:59,236 --> 00:24:00,278
Why are you doing this to me?

405
00:23:59,756 --> 00:24:01,799
Why does anybody do,
something fucked up to someone else?

406
00:24:02,362 --> 00:24:04,967
- For money dude!
- Cha cha cha Ching!!!

407
00:24:04,969 --> 00:24:07,574
- I'll  sell my car.
I'll get you like a thousand bucks.     - For that Mustang?

408
00:24:07,575 --> 00:24:08,617
You mean a hundred dollars?

409
00:24:07,575 --> 00:24:11,648
No, no..I'll get you a 100 thousand bucks.
I swear to God, please?

410
00:24:11,685 --> 00:24:12,746
- We're gonna need a hundred grand.

411
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:15,519
Where the fuck am I supposed to get that much money?

412
00:24:16,447 --> 00:24:19,758
I don't know, Maybe..
The Donner-Wells National Bank on Charles Road.

413
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:20,801
Over the Olive Garden.

414
00:24:20,803 --> 00:24:22,771
How am I supposed to rob a bank?

415
00:24:22,772 --> 00:24:23,814
It's not my problem dude.
It's yours.

416
00:24:24,443 --> 00:24:27,508
Get creative. Maybe, use that scary bomb
strapped to your chest.

417
00:24:28,311 --> 00:24:32,262
Maybe do it the old fashion way.. get a gun, a band of outlaws..
Doesn't matter to me. Its not a rocket science.

418
00:24:33,107 --> 00:24:34,597
- Fine, Then do it yourself.

419
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:38,684
Well..I would do it, but looks like I'm
wearing this gorilla mask and you're already wearing that bomb.

420
00:24:39,008 --> 00:24:41,613
Go ahead and tell him about the bomb vest.

421
00:24:41,614 --> 00:24:44,219
Look, You seem like a pretty smart guy...
but just in case...

422
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,576
you're gonna panic and try to be a hero..and be like,
i'm gonna take this fucking vest off. Fuck this guys, they're assholes..

423
00:24:48,244 --> 00:24:51,173
Don't do that, okay..
'Cos we booby trapped it to shit.

424
00:24:51,872 --> 00:24:54,477
There's also a little  remote detonator on the back,
so we can trigger...

425
00:24:54,479 --> 00:24:58,284
it at any time by dialing a number.

426
00:24:58,285 --> 00:24:59,327
We got your shit on speed dial.

427
00:24:58,909 --> 00:25:02,578
We're watching you alright. So, do what you gotta do.
If you go near a police station..

428
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:07,468
Fourth of July comes a little early this year.

429
00:25:08,032 --> 00:25:09,543
It's 9:00 AM. You got 10 hours.

430
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:15,646
As soon as you get the money,
call this number here.

431
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:19,837
You call it. We give you explicit directions
on where to make the drop off.

432
00:25:20,182 --> 00:25:24,915
If you do good, we give you a six-digit
combination that stops the timer...

433
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:26,833
and open the  lock.

434
00:25:26,835 --> 00:25:27,877
But if you don't do good...

435
00:25:27,878 --> 00:25:30,800
Allow me to make a little demonstration for you.

436
00:25:31,754 --> 00:25:34,359
Pay attention to the uh..
cuddly bear over there.

437
00:25:34,361 --> 00:25:36,966
Ring ring ring..oh look,
the bear is calling..

438
00:25:36,967 --> 00:25:39,572
What a coinsidence. Hello bear,
How's it going?

439
00:25:39,573 --> 00:25:42,669
Yeah, you're just hanging out getting fucked up...
that's cool

440
00:25:43,374 --> 00:25:44,463
What do you mean you couldn't rob the bank?

441
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:48,048
It was too hard???

442
00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:50,654
so you just went back to your bear cave
and hid  like a little crying bitch?

443
00:25:50,656 --> 00:25:53,460
Well, that's a shame,  my stuffed buddy...

444
00:25:53,726 --> 00:25:56,274
B'cos time is up.

445
00:25:58,457 --> 00:25:59,604
I liked that bear.

446
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,971
I don't even fucking know you.

447
00:26:01,941 --> 00:26:04,349
Well, get to it man!
Show and tell is over.

448
00:26:04,923 --> 00:26:07,528
- Alright, and you are free.
- Let's move...

449
00:26:07,529 --> 00:26:11,506
Time's literally ticking right now!

450
00:26:11,762 --> 00:26:14,367
Go on now, get after her.

451
00:26:14,368 --> 00:26:16,973
- Wait, wait...can we please just talk about this?

452
00:26:16,974 --> 00:26:19,579
- Yeah, of course we can talk.

453
00:26:19,581 --> 00:26:22,249
Go on man, get fucking moving!

454
00:26:24,058 --> 00:26:26,455
You're wasting time! Go..fucking move!!!

455
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:28,583
We'll be watching you!

456
00:26:31,486 --> 00:26:32,710
Adios, dumb motherfucker!

457
00:26:33,957 --> 00:26:35,682
Bye! Have fun!!!

458
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:41,049
What the fuck, Dwayne?
You told me that was a replica gun.

459
00:26:41,086 --> 00:26:43,536
Yeah, It was.  Then I paid a Mexican
50 bucks to put...

460
00:26:43,538 --> 00:26:46,143
a firing pin in it.
Now it goes boom.

461
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:48,249
- Dude, we can't have a loaded gun,
around that bomb!

462
00:26:48,886 --> 00:26:54,557
Don't you ever question me.
I'm fucking this bitch.You're just holding the camera.

463
00:26:55,058 --> 00:26:56,698
- I know, man. I'm just saying,
you should've told me.

464
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,860
- This ain't the Marines.
If you hesitate, you  fuck around...

465
00:26:59,862 --> 00:27:01,995
and I will leave you behind.

466
00:27:02,032 --> 00:27:02,773
C'mon!

467
00:27:03,628 --> 00:27:06,494
We've got some surveilence to do.
And possibly breakfast.

468
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,465
And this whole region here,
about 830 thousand...

469
00:27:09,466 --> 00:27:12,071
square miles, was part of the
original...

470
00:27:12,072 --> 00:27:13,357
Louisiana Purchase.

471
00:27:14,252 --> 00:27:15,294
-(coughing)  Nice laser.

472
00:27:14,731 --> 00:27:17,773
- Yeah, its a nice lase, Rodney.
You know what's not nice?

473
00:27:18,297 --> 00:27:19,076
Texting in my class.

474
00:27:19,114 --> 00:27:21,381
- Hey, Steve..you watched the UFC Vitro?

475
00:27:21,382 --> 00:27:23,987
By the way, you think Lisa would go out with me?

476
00:27:23,988 --> 00:27:26,083
Wow!!
Lisa over there?

477
00:27:26,553 --> 00:27:27,793
No way! She's laughing in your face.

478
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:30,994
Don't text in my class anymore, okay?

479
00:27:32,767 --> 00:27:34,163
Everyone, take out your workbooks.

480
00:27:35,373 --> 00:27:36,608
What do you want?

481
00:27:37,063 --> 00:27:37,600
We gotta talk.

482
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,064
I'm at work. Do not mess with...

483
00:27:39,444 --> 00:27:41,792
Please, for the love of God!
Please..talk to me in private, for one minute.

484
00:27:45,235 --> 00:27:48,060
Well, well..well!
Look who wants to apologize.

485
00:27:48,874 --> 00:27:51,479
Well, you know what?
it's gonna take a lot more than some pathetic groveling -

486
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,085
- Chet!  Shut up!
I don't wanna apologize to you!

487
00:27:54,086 --> 00:27:56,691
- Then what do you want?
we don't have anything left to say to each other.

488
00:27:56,693 --> 00:27:59,223
- Last night two guys in masks
strucked me and strapped a bomb to my chest,

489
00:27:59,259 --> 00:28:00,234
and now I have less than nine hours to rob a bank.

490
00:28:01,186 --> 00:28:04,761
- You're hysterical. Great joke.
I'm going back to work now.

491
00:28:05,606 --> 00:28:07,242
What is this?

492
00:28:08,223 --> 00:28:09,474
What the fuck?  Is that real?

493
00:28:09,864 --> 00:28:14,129
- I'm not fucking around here! Two guys did this to me..
and if I don't rob that bank in time, this thing is gonna blow.

494
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,172
- Seriously?

495
00:28:15,174 --> 00:28:16,216
- Seriously.

496
00:28:15,969 --> 00:28:19,898
- And your first idea was to come to a
school filled with young children?

497
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,756
- Well, I guess...
I didn't really think about it.

498
00:28:23,017 --> 00:28:23,621
-  Just back away.

499
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:25,831
back away...back away.
Back away!

500
00:28:25,957 --> 00:28:29,824
- I think the vest is probably safe for now. These guys don't want me to
blow myself up on accident before I get their money. Right?

501
00:28:30,825 --> 00:28:33,430
Oh yeah, so you figure the two psychopaths..

502
00:28:33,432 --> 00:28:36,037
that put a bomb to your chest made sure it was safe?
There's no margin for error...

503
00:28:36,038 --> 00:28:37,947
That their fucking  bomb designed!?

504
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:38,991
I don't know!

505
00:28:38,644 --> 00:28:42,809
All I do know is that this is real.
This is happening.

506
00:28:42,811 --> 00:28:45,111
but I have nowhere else to go.

507
00:28:45,113 --> 00:28:46,155
- For what?

508
00:28:46,547 --> 00:28:48,308
I need your help. Okay.
I can't do this alone.

509
00:28:49,685 --> 00:28:50,769
- Damn it!

510
00:28:51,749 --> 00:28:52,801
But I wanna tell you,
You are fucked!

511
00:28:52,803 --> 00:28:53,845
- I know.

512
00:28:54,022 --> 00:28:55,220
- But I can't!

513
00:28:55,909 --> 00:28:58,994
Cos I'm a better man than you.
if I let you go and explode or whatever,

514
00:28:59,651 --> 00:29:01,037
Cos that shit might come back
and eat at my conscience,

515
00:29:02,331 --> 00:29:03,999
and affect my relationships with other people.

516
00:29:04,927 --> 00:29:06,678
Like my wife and kids

517
00:29:07,168 --> 00:29:08,200
and shit.

518
00:29:09,024 --> 00:29:13,538
We're having a picnic or something, one day...
and I'd just be like...God damn it!

519
00:29:13,871 --> 00:29:15,486
I shouldn't have Nick explode that time.

520
00:29:16,311 --> 00:29:18,052
- That's a...very rational way to look at the situation.

521
00:29:19,741 --> 00:29:20,877
And you're right,

522
00:29:22,055 --> 00:29:23,587
about being a better man than me.

523
00:29:25,736 --> 00:29:28,185
Just walk a few feet in front of me?

524
00:29:28,186 --> 00:29:29,228
Yeah, I can do that.

525
00:29:30,005 --> 00:29:32,355
Thank you.

526
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,762
©© Subtitle By D3xt3r ©©

527
00:29:51,017 --> 00:29:51,864
Did you miss me?

528
00:29:51,866 --> 00:29:52,908
Of course,  I miss you.

529
00:29:52,909 --> 00:29:53,951
Don't lie to me.

530
00:29:53,953 --> 00:29:56,779
Those guys get Juicy, but you get Jacklyn.

531
00:29:57,178 --> 00:29:59,881
Alright, Cool Jacklyn...This is what I want.
First, I want my money,

532
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:01,939
And I wanna kill that old motherfucker,

533
00:30:01,976 --> 00:30:04,007
then get the fuck out of here. Alright?

534
00:30:04,044 --> 00:30:06,477
- Well, that's how it's gonna go.
We're just waiting on a call.

535
00:30:10,231 --> 00:30:11,534
You see my impatient face right here.

536
00:30:13,656 --> 00:30:14,844
- Well, I think I can keep you entertained.

537
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:17,278
C'mon Baby.

538
00:30:17,638 --> 00:30:19,786
- Oh, that's nice!

539
00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:23,084
Okay, once we sawed both of your arms,

540
00:30:23,085 --> 00:30:28,006
Slip the vest over your head. Then,  go to the hospital, where they'll
reattached both your arm. We'll just keep your arms on ice the whole time.

541
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:29,831
- Fuck that!

542
00:30:29,862 --> 00:30:31,243
Well, I don't know what to do, man!

543
00:30:31,244 --> 00:30:32,286
All these sites say different shit.

544
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:35,659
There's not a lot of consensus
in the bomb disarming community.

545
00:30:35,696 --> 00:30:36,607
What do they do in 'The Hurt Locker'?

546
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:38,389
- I don't know, I didn't see it.

547
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:43,102
Yeah, me neither. I NetFlixed it like six months ago.
It's just been sitting on my coffee table.

548
00:30:43,811 --> 00:30:47,611
Its so dumb, I'm paying like $12.99 a month.
Just keeps same 3 movies in line..

549
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,598
- Just keep on looking online okay?

550
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:55,404
- Alright, you can't expect me to become
a bomb disarming expert, after looking online for 5 minutes.

551
00:30:56,624 --> 00:31:01,430
- It's too tight!

552
00:31:02,118 --> 00:31:03,462
Can you please take this seriously, Okay?

553
00:31:04,891 --> 00:31:06,809
This is scaring the shit out of me.

554
00:31:09,652 --> 00:31:11,939
This guys may've been following me,
I have no idea what they look like.

555
00:31:11,976 --> 00:31:13,008
They could be anywhere.
- Call the cops!

556
00:31:13,009 --> 00:31:14,051
- No we can't!

557
00:31:14,053 --> 00:31:17,348
They see the cops show up,
they blow the vest and cut their losses.

558
00:31:19,069 --> 00:31:21,487
- What do I do, Chet?
What do I do?

559
00:31:21,489 --> 00:31:22,531
- I don't know man!

560
00:31:23,604 --> 00:31:27,242
- I guess you gotta just rob the bank.

561
00:31:27,941 --> 00:31:30,400
It's gonna be okay.

562
00:31:30,402 --> 00:31:31,444
No, it's not gonna be okay!

563
00:31:31,445 --> 00:31:32,487
I'm gonna blow up!

564
00:31:33,602 --> 00:31:35,301
C'mon!

565
00:31:35,802 --> 00:31:37,303
Get yourself together!

566
00:31:37,534 --> 00:31:38,169
Fuck Chet!

567
00:31:38,417 --> 00:31:39,616
You know exactly how to rob a bank.

568
00:31:39,653 --> 00:31:40,743
- What are you talking about?

569
00:31:41,254 --> 00:31:42,125
- Point Break.

570
00:31:42,725 --> 00:31:44,971
That movie is like a how-to guide for bank robberies.

571
00:31:44,973 --> 00:31:46,015
You just bust in.

572
00:31:46,467 --> 00:31:49,146
Masks. Guns.  Move fast.
Stick to the tellers and don't bother with the vault.

573
00:31:50,429 --> 00:31:51,742
- Yeah...You are right.
I guess it's pretty simple

574
00:31:52,941 --> 00:31:55,713
The Donner-Wells on Charles Road.

575
00:31:55,714 --> 00:31:56,756
- The one by the Olive Garden?
That's my bank.

576
00:31:57,591 --> 00:32:01,448
Small. Standard Security...
Totally manageable for one dude.

577
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,596
- One dude..you mean...
You're gonna do it with me?

578
00:32:05,222 --> 00:32:09,230
- No. But I'm happy to give Tips..
advice..motivational speeches....

579
00:32:09,598 --> 00:32:11,939
- Oh Chet, Please...Jesus Christ!
I need you on this, Okay?

580
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,864
If I do it alone, I'm dead. Please?

581
00:32:17,149 --> 00:32:18,671
- Okay, Just tell me this.

582
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,215
How many times, Did you sleep with my sister?

583
00:32:22,217 --> 00:32:23,259
- Just once.

584
00:32:22,726 --> 00:32:24,394
I swear to God. Graduation night.

585
00:32:25,614 --> 00:32:26,531
- Okay.

586
00:32:27,532 --> 00:32:28,626
I'll help you on one condition...

587
00:32:29,628 --> 00:32:33,026
You never mention my sister again,
and you never speak to my sister again.

588
00:32:38,031 --> 00:32:38,958
Okay.

589
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:41,684
Yes, we can do this.

590
00:32:45,912 --> 00:32:47,653
Whoah, Ski masks.

591
00:32:47,654 --> 00:32:48,696
- Perfect!
- Alright.

592
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,365
Okay, here we are.

593
00:32:53,366 --> 00:32:55,971
So, we get the handguns...or the Uzis?
What do you think?

594
00:32:59,622 --> 00:33:01,717
Get down on the ground and give me the money in the bank!

595
00:33:02,332 --> 00:33:03,906
- Wait, how am i suppose to get the money..
If i'm on the ground?

596
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:07,503
- Go get the money in the bank,
and get down on the ground, afterwards!

597
00:33:07,504 --> 00:33:08,546
- Alright, I'll be right back.

598
00:33:17,501 --> 00:33:18,710
Dude, you totally fucked up this mix tape.

599
00:33:20,118 --> 00:33:24,892
We're not a bunch of frat guys,
trying to finger bang girls to MatchBox 20.

600
00:33:25,602 --> 00:33:28,354
Should be like, some industrial shit.
Some, fucking German Techno.

601
00:33:29,115 --> 00:33:30,491
- Sorry, Dwayne.
That song just means a lot to me.

602
00:33:31,971 --> 00:33:34,462
- Well, it doesn't mean a lot to me.
It means a fucking headache to me.

603
00:33:34,984 --> 00:33:36,672
And suppose this guy,
could fucking hurry up!

604
00:33:37,341 --> 00:33:39,467
- Are you worried about that other guy
that fucking mini G?

605
00:33:40,228 --> 00:33:42,037
- No, man.  He picked him up from the school.

606
00:33:42,467 --> 00:33:45,572
So long as he's not a cop, I don't give a shit.
He can bring the whole fucking faculty for all I care.

607
00:33:45,972 --> 00:33:48,669
As long as he gets  my money.

608
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:49,712
- Oh, check that.

609
00:33:51,769 --> 00:33:54,284
- Are you looking at Subway..
You want me to run over and get some sandwiches?

610
00:33:54,835 --> 00:33:56,132
I'm hungry as shit, dude.

611
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:57,176
- Look!

612
00:33:57,607 --> 00:33:59,723
It will be the perfect place for the tanning salon.

613
00:34:00,401 --> 00:34:01,891
- You are so right.
- Yeah.

614
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:04,290
- You know, I've been doing a lot of thinking.

615
00:34:04,749 --> 00:34:07,354
and I want you to start off the front counter.

616
00:34:07,355 --> 00:34:09,733
I know, it sounds like a demotion,
but it's not.

617
00:34:09,734 --> 00:34:10,776
Alright, It's a very important job.

618
00:34:10,778 --> 00:34:13,604
We're gonna be using a lot of code words and shit.

619
00:34:13,605 --> 00:34:14,647
- For what?

620
00:34:15,466 --> 00:34:18,927
- Well Say..a gentleman walks in and says ,
"Hello, good afternoon. I'd like a tan".

621
00:34:19,626 --> 00:34:20,731
Well, that just means that he wants a tan.

622
00:34:20,732 --> 00:34:21,774
Okay.

623
00:34:21,231 --> 00:34:25,271
But if a guy comes in.. and he's like..
" Yo! I want a deluxe tan,"

624
00:34:25,795 --> 00:34:28,042
Well..that means he wants a tan and a blow job.

625
00:34:28,044 --> 00:34:32,123
Which mean, you have to go to the back and...
- and Blow Him?

626
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:34,326
No. You have to find a girl,
who's gonna suck him off.

627
00:34:34,328 --> 00:34:35,370
- Okay.

628
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,900
Guns..

629
00:34:38,402 --> 00:34:39,632
Masks..

630
00:34:40,205 --> 00:34:42,602
Are you sure, you 'all don't want to grab some condoms?

631
00:34:43,385 --> 00:34:47,753
- Uh, no.  Why??
- Because this is usually what men buy before they rape someone,

632
00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:51,881
We're not rapists.
Us two..? Small fries, No way.

633
00:34:53,018 --> 00:34:55,530
- Is that cash or credit for your rape kit?

634
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,365
This is a Slider station and a rape kit.

635
00:34:58,919 --> 00:35:00,274
Cos we're getting one of those too.
- We'll pay cash.

636
00:35:01,129 --> 00:35:03,647
not into rape, just into sliders.

637
00:35:04,219 --> 00:35:05,874
If it's anal, Is it a Hard anal then?

638
00:35:05,876 --> 00:35:06,918
No, no. The anal will tip it off too much.

639
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:11,220
- What if a black guy comes in,
will he go to tanning glover?

640
00:35:11,752 --> 00:35:14,357
- No, we're not going to profile,
racially..our clients.

641
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:18,185
We don't say anything, if a black guy comes in.
If a dude comes in, that wants a black chick...

642
00:35:18,925 --> 00:35:21,530
Then, yeah. That'll be a tanning glover.

643
00:35:21,531 --> 00:35:22,573
We have codes for that.

644
00:35:21,531 --> 00:35:24,136
Do we have codes for missionary, anal, black chicks?

645
00:35:24,138 --> 00:35:26,743
I have a glossary of terms in my files,
back at home.

646
00:35:26,744 --> 00:35:30,653
But I'm not gonna bother get into that right now,
because you my friend... are supposed to be on lookout

647
00:35:31,352 --> 00:35:32,524
and I know how terrible
you're at multitasking.

648
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:35,496
- Oh they're getting away dude..
they're getting away.

649
00:35:37,112 --> 00:35:39,337
Go go..go!
- Enought Travis...

650
00:35:39,339 --> 00:35:42,314
I'm sick of this fucking family dollar bulllshit.

651
00:35:42,315 --> 00:35:43,357
Its time to get our heads,
into the game.

652
00:35:54,871 --> 00:35:56,446
Yo, can you please be more careful,
you're getting the paint all over the car!

653
00:35:58,004 --> 00:35:59,908
Really, you're worried about the paint
in this car?

654
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,694
- Yeah.
You're car is a total piece of shit.

655
00:36:02,696 --> 00:36:03,738
Yo, please?

656
00:36:03,739 --> 00:36:04,781
Your car is garbage. It's like....

657
00:36:04,783 --> 00:36:07,268
You bought a Mustang,
and the Mustang has Aids.

658
00:36:07,305 --> 00:36:08,458
And you're worried about paint in it?

659
00:36:12,318 --> 00:36:14,923
Fast isn't the same as instant. Okay?
You gotta let it sit for like 20 minutes.

660
00:36:14,925 --> 00:36:18,751
Alright, We don't have time to sit around
and literally watch paint dry. Okay?

661
00:36:18,916 --> 00:36:20,028
Aren't we going straight to the bank?

662
00:36:21,326 --> 00:36:22,477
- I was actually thinking
we got to stop and steal a car first.

663
00:36:23,364 --> 00:36:25,969
- What?  Why!  We've a car.

664
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:28,906
- Yeah, we have my car. Okay.
I can't use this as a getaway vehicle.

665
00:36:29,281 --> 00:36:31,286
They'll trace the plates.
Even if we do get away, we'll be arrested.

666
00:36:31,324 --> 00:36:33,614
How are we gonna steal a car?
I don't know how to hot wire a vehicle...

667
00:36:33,896 --> 00:36:35,453
Do you know how to hot wire a car?

668
00:36:35,556 --> 00:36:37,453
That's why I was thinking gotta stop...
and steal one from..

669
00:36:37,455 --> 00:36:40,725
your parents' friends.
The Fishers.

670
00:36:40,762 --> 00:36:42,289
Remember, how they used to pay us
to clean their garage?

671
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:43,332
They leave the keys in there.
And they've got a Datsun.

672
00:36:43,631 --> 00:36:45,121
That's a fast car.

673
00:36:45,123 --> 00:36:46,165
- I'm not stealing the Fishers' Datsun.

674
00:36:46,096 --> 00:36:47,910
Let's steal one of your parent's friends cars.

675
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:53,315
What friends?

676
00:36:53,316 --> 00:36:55,921
What friends? My parents don't have any.

677
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,527
My dad moved away, when your big mouth humiliated him,
and ruined his marriage...

678
00:36:58,529 --> 00:37:00,989
and no one wanted to hang out with the mom
who everyone knew fucked a lifeguard.

679
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,115
- You never should have told me!
I was 13 years old!!!

680
00:37:04,117 --> 00:37:07,901
I couldn't process information like that.
I thought it was cool that your mom fucked a lifeguard.

681
00:37:08,568 --> 00:37:10,163
Fuck, I'm sorry!

682
00:37:10,685 --> 00:37:12,936
Okay, I accept your apology.

683
00:37:14,735 --> 00:37:17,533
That's it?
You're not gonna apologize for sleeping with my sister?

684
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,165
- You told me not to mention it.

685
00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:21,366
Great..

686
00:37:25,567 --> 00:37:27,292
I just want this goddamn day to be over!

687
00:37:35,914 --> 00:37:38,519
It's locked!
Fuck!

688
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,125
Okay, climb through the window.

689
00:37:41,127 --> 00:37:42,993
You climb through the window.

690
00:37:43,201 --> 00:37:44,775
- No, i'm holding the bag!

691
00:37:43,733 --> 00:37:47,194
I'm holding the bomb...
Climb through the window.

692
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,001
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, I'm great.

693
00:38:09,098 --> 00:38:11,203
- Who's it?
- Chuck...

694
00:38:15,249 --> 00:38:17,854
The keys aren't here.
They always leave the keys out.

695
00:38:17,855 --> 00:38:20,460
- Yeah.  When we were teenagers.

696
00:38:20,461 --> 00:38:23,536
Okay, Let's just find them.

697
00:38:34,223 --> 00:38:35,411
Wait, Did you hear that?

698
00:38:36,287 --> 00:38:37,444
no..what?

699
00:38:40,499 --> 00:38:44,898
Mr. Fisher is coming!

700
00:38:44,899 --> 00:38:45,941
- What!

701
00:38:45,232 --> 00:38:46,524
Put it on.

702
00:38:47,317 --> 00:38:49,922
- What are you doing?

703
00:38:49,923 --> 00:38:54,228
I'm doing what I have to.

704
00:38:54,636 --> 00:38:58,076
Okay, shut the door.

705
00:38:58,493 --> 00:39:00,072
Where are the car keys?

706
00:39:00,474 --> 00:39:01,498
They're in my pocket!

707
00:39:01,553 --> 00:39:02,525
Quiet down and give them to me.

708
00:39:02,527 --> 00:39:03,569
Alright, i'm just getting em out of my pocket!

709
00:39:07,594 --> 00:39:09,802
Now listen, We're obviously stealing the car.

710
00:39:09,803 --> 00:39:13,493
I don't want you to report it stolen until
later tonight. Let's say 5 o'clock.

711
00:39:13,495 --> 00:39:14,537
6 to be safe.

712
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:15,401
- Six fifteen!

713
00:39:15,403 --> 00:39:16,928
Yeah, right...six fifteen.

714
00:39:16,929 --> 00:39:17,971
- Don't even bother calling the cops!

715
00:39:17,973 --> 00:39:19,015
We own the cops!

716
00:39:20,511 --> 00:39:23,232
If you mess with us,
I swear to God, I will...

717
00:39:24,223 --> 00:39:26,488
I will shoot your son.
- Dylan Fisher!              - Yes..Dylan Fisher!

718
00:39:27,321 --> 00:39:28,805
I know where he works too.

719
00:39:28,893 --> 00:39:30,282
He works at the travel agency!

720
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,326
- He's the douchebag with the bangs.

721
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,370
- That's right!

722
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:36,659
No, Please. Don't do that.
I won't say anything. I promise, just leave Dylan alone.

723
00:39:37,442 --> 00:39:40,047
if you call the cops, there's gonna be an
undertaker styling

724
00:39:40,048 --> 00:39:41,078
his stupid fucking bangs!

725
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:42,121
- Cos he'll be dead!

726
00:39:42,123 --> 00:39:43,165
- That's right.
Because he'll be dead.

727
00:39:43,751 --> 00:39:46,866
Now open the fucking garage door.

728
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,285
- Do you have any snacks?
Like Conolla bars...

729
00:39:50,286 --> 00:39:52,891
or youghurts???
- Not now..

730
00:39:52,892 --> 00:39:55,497
Okay, remember our deal.

731
00:39:55,499 --> 00:39:57,311
six fifteen not a minute early.

732
00:39:58,213 --> 00:40:00,090
Please, just go.

733
00:40:01,978 --> 00:40:03,468
Thanks!

734
00:40:04,246 --> 00:40:07,305
Have a great afternoon!

735
00:40:13,336 --> 00:40:15,941
Oh man..I'm totally implicated.

736
00:40:15,943 --> 00:40:18,548
What if he saw my brown hands?

737
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:20,821
There's only like, four Indian families
that live in Grand Rapids.

738
00:40:21,593 --> 00:40:23,401
- Mr.Fisher is a fucking CPA.
I think he'll be okay.

739
00:40:24,502 --> 00:40:26,175
Awesome.  I'm stuck inside an even smaller car
with you and a bomb.

740
00:40:26,978 --> 00:40:28,866
Next time, why don't we steal a smart car.

741
00:40:30,602 --> 00:40:31,993
- This thing's got some pickup.

742
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:36,756
Take it easy, we've got plenty of time.

743
00:40:36,758 --> 00:40:37,800
I know...but there's one thing I just want to do, first.

744
00:40:38,498 --> 00:40:40,640
Oh get something to eat.
Thank you..let's go to Mr.Burger.

745
00:40:41,235 --> 00:40:45,225
Actually, I wanna tell my boss to fuck off.

746
00:40:45,262 --> 00:40:48,021
- What...are you joking?

747
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:51,195
You wanna run a personal errand,
on a way to a bank robbery?

748
00:40:51,196 --> 00:40:52,157
- and you want us to go get lunch.

749
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:56,345
- Yeah, b'cos i'm hungry and i thought..
It'll be nice to have one last burger before i'm incarcerated.

750
00:40:56,383 --> 00:40:58,353
- Chet, this is not a personal errand, alright.
This is very important to me.

751
00:41:00,021 --> 00:41:02,966
- and so, this is your big moment huh?
Putting in your 2 weeks notice at the pizza place?

752
00:41:02,967 --> 00:41:05,282
- Yeah man, yeah.
That's pretty much it.

753
00:41:06,328 --> 00:41:08,585
- Whatever! Now, you're just making me depressed.
Let's just go.

754
00:41:09,352 --> 00:41:10,655
I need to take a piss here though.

755
00:41:12,604 --> 00:41:14,231
What are you doing?

756
00:41:14,233 --> 00:41:16,146
It's gross back here.
Park out front.

757
00:41:16,147 --> 00:41:19,015
You said, you had to take a piss.
I'll look into the employees rest room.

758
00:41:19,329 --> 00:41:21,810
Fine, hurry up please.
It smells like dead animals and pizza out here.

759
00:41:23,134 --> 00:41:25,093
Yeah, they're like..
we are fucking taking care of business.

760
00:41:25,657 --> 00:41:26,741
Hey, hey ...hey.

761
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:31,244
Oh shit, Where the fuck is this guy going into?

762
00:41:31,245 --> 00:41:33,850
What's in there?  Some sort of secret FBI headquarters?
Some shit around here?

763
00:41:33,851 --> 00:41:38,167
You know what, I got to give this bomb a call...

764
00:41:39,283 --> 00:41:40,878
Let me go after and take a look.
Jesus!

765
00:41:41,702 --> 00:41:45,830
- Jesus..what the hell?
Are you fucking gay for this guy or something?

766
00:41:46,362 --> 00:41:48,853
- What..yeah. If wanting a lot of money is gay...
then yeah...I'm Elton John.

767
00:41:49,448 --> 00:41:51,314
Well, then hurry the fuck up.
Go do some reconnaissance.

768
00:41:52,648 --> 00:41:54,222
Report back..or I will...

769
00:41:54,738 --> 00:41:59,293

770
00:42:10,323 --> 00:42:11,885
Hey, Kate. I'm right outside the building.

771
00:42:11,923 --> 00:42:13,625
...no, I'm here right now.

772
00:42:13,662 --> 00:42:14,859
Why are you acting so strange?

773
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:18,219
Because strange shit is going on.
I'll explain everything. Just meet me where I texted you.

774
00:42:18,607 --> 00:42:20,083
Nick, i was just about to go out.
What going on?

775
00:42:20,734 --> 00:42:22,121
- please, it's important.

776
00:42:28,017 --> 00:42:30,178
Nick, What's going on?

777
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:31,368
Are you Okay?

778
00:42:31,369 --> 00:42:32,411
- Wait, just stay over there, okay?
Please...

779
00:42:32,973 --> 00:42:37,184
Alright, listen...something happened to me,
last night. I was out on this run and uh...

780
00:42:37,936 --> 00:42:42,966
I started thinking...
'What if this is the last shitty pizza I deliver'?

781
00:42:43,612 --> 00:42:46,217
- I'd say, it's probably a good thing.

782
00:42:46,219 --> 00:42:48,706
Nick, I'm super busy right now.
This is not the best time.

783
00:42:48,891 --> 00:42:50,423
- Okay, right now..
its kinda all i have.

784
00:42:50,863 --> 00:42:52,562
Come by later, and we'll talk okay?
- No, there isn't time!

785
00:42:53,188 --> 00:42:55,736
Okay, can i tell you,
the single worst mistake of my life?

786
00:42:56,436 --> 00:42:58,849
- Okay?

787
00:42:58,850 --> 00:42:59,892
It was sleeping with you.

788
00:42:59,894 --> 00:43:00,936
- Thanks.

789
00:43:01,231 --> 00:43:02,273
No, no..you don't understand.

790
00:43:02,275 --> 00:43:06,783
That's when i knew for sure, that I'm in love with you.
What I didn't know was, how the fuck to deal with this!

791
00:43:06,785 --> 00:43:07,827
So, i screwed it all up.

792
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:09,883
- That was like, 8 years ago.

793
00:43:10,122 --> 00:43:10,854
I know.

794
00:43:10,856 --> 00:43:11,898
But I just want you to know that
if today...

795
00:43:13,236 --> 00:43:14,330
was the final day

796
00:43:15,321 --> 00:43:18,573
of my brief and uh...shitty existence.

797
00:43:19,168 --> 00:43:21,571
And I could only see just one more person...

798
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,548
It would be YOU.

799
00:43:25,549 --> 00:43:27,593
- Nick?
- I gotta go.

800
00:43:29,202 --> 00:43:32,355
Wait, wait! You just can't say all this,
and just walk away!

801
00:43:32,357 --> 00:43:33,399
- Unfortunately, I have to.

802
00:43:34,076 --> 00:43:38,256
- Also, i told Chet...
we had sex.

803
00:43:38,258 --> 00:43:39,300
- What the fuck?

804
00:43:39,195 --> 00:43:41,800
- Yeah, i think It's his girlfriend or something.

805
00:43:41,801 --> 00:43:43,165
They've been up there for a while.

806
00:43:43,425 --> 00:43:46,299
I betcha, homeboy's trying to get one last blow job
in case he don't make it.

807
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,869
I like his style.

808
00:43:50,069 --> 00:43:54,270
Hey, what's up man?
I'm just fixing the vaster.

809
00:43:56,178 --> 00:43:58,961
Yo Juicy! what's happening?
This is King Dwayne.

810
00:43:59,452 --> 00:44:02,057
I've been thinking about you alot..and...

811
00:44:02,058 --> 00:44:05,252
I don't know. I just feel cool inside,
I'm excited to get this money.

812
00:44:05,526 --> 00:44:08,179
and Me and You could start our thing.

813
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,737
I'm thinking alot about the poles scepter, deal.

814
00:44:16,734 --> 00:44:18,441
I just want you to know that,
It's gonna be mutual.

815
00:44:18,442 --> 00:44:19,484
You won't just have to polish my scepter;

816
00:44:19,486 --> 00:44:22,772
I will also lick your Crown,
Which is...

817
00:44:22,773 --> 00:44:25,269
a euphamaism for you know,
Eating your pussy.

818
00:44:25,348 --> 00:44:28,173
Okay, give me a call.
When you get a chance, okay GoodBye!

819
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:34,907
What? Have my penis shrink to 12 inches...!

820
00:44:34,908 --> 00:44:36,062
You're actually early for your shift!

821
00:44:36,112 --> 00:44:38,556
- No, Christ!
I quit! Fuck You!!!

822
00:44:37,514 --> 00:44:40,912
Fuck You!

823
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,127
You've been there almost 20 minutes!

824
00:44:51,128 --> 00:44:52,170
- Well, I had a lot of shit to errand.

825
00:44:52,171 --> 00:44:54,896
Hey, you have a Mr.Burger?
You get me one?

826
00:44:54,933 --> 00:44:56,743
- I did. But you took so long,
I ate it.

827
00:44:57,969 --> 00:44:59,209
Alright, give me one of those 5-Hour Energy fuckers!
Let's get to it.

828
00:44:59,825 --> 00:45:01,552
I drank those too.

829
00:45:01,553 --> 00:45:02,595
- Motherfucker!

830
00:45:05,689 --> 00:45:07,117
Let's go and rob the bank!

831
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:17,318
I don't believe, we are doing this.

832
00:45:17,319 --> 00:45:18,361
Okay, You go for the money.

833
00:45:18,363 --> 00:45:19,405
I'll cover the crowd.
In and out.

834
00:45:19,581 --> 00:45:22,186
I'm not feeling great man.
I drank like three of those

835
00:45:22,187 --> 00:45:24,792
5-Hour Energy drinks.
It's just too much energy...

836
00:45:24,793 --> 00:45:28,191
I'm cramping up from all the energy,
my arms are jittery!

837
00:45:28,193 --> 00:45:29,235
- Dude, settle down.
You ready for this?

838
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:31,142
Let's do it, C'mon.

839
00:45:32,414 --> 00:45:34,363
What do I call you in there,
if I need to tell you something?

840
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:36,448
Call me Tivon.  You'll be Darius.

841
00:45:37,012 --> 00:45:38,848
I can tell you're not a black guy through the mask stuff.

842
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:41,307
Alright, you're still Darius and I'm Luis.

843
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:43,995
What if we are both Hispanics?
Like we met in a gang, in prison.

844
00:45:43,997 --> 00:45:46,602
I like it. Maybe we stab a prison guard...

845
00:45:46,603 --> 00:45:48,105
And we escaped,
and we're on the run.

846
00:45:48,106 --> 00:45:49,148
- Yes..We're two loco motherfuckers

847
00:45:49,209 --> 00:45:51,035
and that's the way we gotta roll in there.

848
00:45:51,037 --> 00:45:52,079
Nothing's getting in our way!

849
00:45:52,081 --> 00:45:53,123
- Wait?
- What?

850
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:54,703
I still don't a hispanic name.

851
00:45:55,694 --> 00:45:56,767
You're Cruz.

852
00:45:56,769 --> 00:45:57,811
- That's a great fucking name!

853
00:45:59,828 --> 00:46:01,365
Let's do this!!!

854
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:05,586
Bank robbery!! Move...
Everybody put your hands in the air!

855
00:46:05,588 --> 00:46:06,817
No, get on the ground!

856
00:46:06,818 --> 00:46:08,874
Actually, listen to him,
get on the fucking ground!

857
00:46:08,911 --> 00:46:11,222
Hey, hey...
back away!!

858
00:46:12,442 --> 00:46:13,849
Don't even think about it.
Nobody press the buttons.

859
00:46:15,049 --> 00:46:17,841
If you do, I'll shoot you in the face.
Now get over there, and get on the ground.

860
00:46:18,178 --> 00:46:20,157
Now!
Go..go. GO!

861
00:46:20,074 --> 00:46:21,369
You, just stand right there and don't do shit!

862
00:46:21,371 --> 00:46:22,413
On the ground!

863
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:26,625
Don't make any sudden moves..okay?

864
00:46:26,626 --> 00:46:29,231
Mustache! Stop looking at my face!!!

865
00:46:29,232 --> 00:46:31,399
We just killed a prison guard,
and we're not afraid to kill again.

866
00:46:31,401 --> 00:46:33,293
- Yeah, we stabbed him in the eye,
with a spoon.

867
00:46:33,294 --> 00:46:34,336
Now! Very slowly,
get down..

868
00:46:35,493 --> 00:46:36,289
and take your gun out and toss it.

869
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:37,332
C'mon...quicker!

870
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:42,893
Oh, god!  I don't want the gun!

871
00:46:43,645 --> 00:46:44,627
Did you do that on purpose!?
- No, It was an accident!

872
00:46:44,664 --> 00:46:46,481
Are you guys working together?
What's going on here?

873
00:46:46,482 --> 00:46:48,115
Please take this gun away!

874
00:46:48,117 --> 00:46:49,159
Just toss it, lady!

875
00:46:57,454 --> 00:46:59,872
I think she got the femoral artery!

876
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:04,553
- I'm so sorry!  It was an accident!

877
00:47:04,554 --> 00:47:07,674
- Fuck you!
Who slides a gun like that!?

878
00:47:07,676 --> 00:47:11,268
Dude, this guy got shot and  bleeding out,
he's gonna die and we're going to prison!

879
00:47:11,269 --> 00:47:13,426
No, no! Luis and Cruz are never going back to prison!

880
00:47:13,427 --> 00:47:15,299
Why isn't anybody getting me help!?

881
00:47:15,636 --> 00:47:18,241
Sir, let me see where you're hit.

882
00:47:18,242 --> 00:47:20,847
It's just a flesh wound, Man.
You're gonna be okay.

883
00:47:20,848 --> 00:47:23,204
Cruz, how we doing on the money?

884
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:26,321
oh, Sorry, Luis.

885
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:28,912
Don't make a sound.

886
00:47:29,376 --> 00:47:31,981
You! What's your name?
- Sandra.

887
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:34,587
Alright, Sandra.
You get us a bag with a 100 thousand dollars...

888
00:47:34,589 --> 00:47:37,104
we'll grab it and get the fuck out of here.
No one gets hurt!

889
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:38,884
Can I trust you?

890
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:40,874
Alright, let's go!
Let's get some money.

891
00:47:40,875 --> 00:47:43,480
Whoa, Cruz. You're breaking your own rules.

892
00:47:43,482 --> 00:47:45,164
Not the vault,
stick to the tellers.

893
00:47:45,165 --> 00:47:48,289
I don't have that much money in the counter.
I'll have to go in the vault.

894
00:47:49,398 --> 00:47:52,003
Fuck it!
Go to the vault, let's go!

895
00:47:52,004 --> 00:47:56,012
Go..go, go!
Hurry, hurrry!

896
00:47:57,029 --> 00:48:00,505
Dude's been fucking shot.

897
00:48:01,194 --> 00:48:02,632
Time is money here.

898
00:48:03,378 --> 00:48:04,665
Sir? You wanna get shot in the other knee?

899
00:48:05,776 --> 00:48:07,480
Didn't think so..
Keep it down.

900
00:48:09,102 --> 00:48:11,707
Got it...got it.
Good! Thank you Sandra.

901
00:48:11,708 --> 00:48:14,313
I'm sorry, everybody.

902
00:48:14,315 --> 00:48:17,187
I know we probably fucked up your day.
I'm thinking of you in particular, sir.

903
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:21,664
Actually, you know what...
Here...Peel a few bills. On me.

904
00:48:21,715 --> 00:48:23,832
Anybody rats this guy to the cops
and I'm coming after you.

905
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:24,876
I remember faces. Right Cruz?

906
00:48:24,877 --> 00:48:25,919
He remember faces.

907
00:48:27,293 --> 00:48:28,414
There you go, Sir.

908
00:48:31,376 --> 00:48:33,981
Sandra.. What the fuck was that?

909
00:48:33,982 --> 00:48:36,587
What happened to our trust?
- I'm sorry, they make us do it.

910
00:48:36,588 --> 00:48:39,501
Hey Sandra, we need you here.
We all do.

911
00:48:39,924 --> 00:48:42,529
So, would you kindly fill another bag,
Not a bank bag, this time.

912
00:48:42,531 --> 00:48:45,136
A garbage bag.
And Cruz, you watch her.

913
00:48:45,137 --> 00:48:46,179
Let's go, Sandra. C'mon.
I know your antics this time.

914
00:48:45,137 --> 00:48:47,742
Go, go!

915
00:48:47,743 --> 00:48:50,922
Boot up! I'm watching you.

916
00:48:50,924 --> 00:48:51,966
We are not friends, no more.

917
00:48:54,035 --> 00:48:55,317
Give me the bag, quickly!

918
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:58,364
Thanks, Sandra.

919
00:49:00,621 --> 00:49:02,895
Whoa!  Which one of you assholes tripped the alarm!?

920
00:49:02,932 --> 00:49:04,778
Sandra, don't tell me,
you did that too.

921
00:49:05,352 --> 00:49:07,957
No!  It was Mark!
He pushed the button when you guys came in!

922
00:49:07,958 --> 00:49:10,563
Sandra, you bitch!
Now they're gonna kill the both us!

923
00:49:10,564 --> 00:49:11,721
You're the manager!

924
00:49:11,723 --> 00:49:12,765
Fuck both of you!

925
00:49:13,171 --> 00:49:17,560
I'm a regular guy and you fucked me!

926
00:49:17,561 --> 00:49:18,603
So,Thank you  for fucking...

927
00:49:17,987 --> 00:49:20,731
a regular guy!

928
00:49:20,769 --> 00:49:22,396
And his partner, Cruz!

929
00:49:22,397 --> 00:49:25,002
That's right..

930
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:27,599
Donna-Wells just got rob.

931
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,705
Drop your weapons!

932
00:49:30,706 --> 00:49:33,311
Put your hands on your heads.

933
00:49:33,312 --> 00:49:35,917
Now, slowly get your ass on the ground.

934
00:49:35,919 --> 00:49:38,524
Do it now!

935
00:49:38,525 --> 00:49:40,766
Guess what!
You just brought a gun to a bomb fight, officer!

936
00:49:41,715 --> 00:49:45,603
Now, I pull these wires out and we all go!
So, you got ten seconds to drop your weapon -

937
00:49:46,029 --> 00:49:46,758
One, Two!

938
00:49:49,837 --> 00:49:52,442
I can't believe that worked!
That was awesome.

939
00:49:52,443 --> 00:49:55,048
He was tempting a desperate motherfucker.

940
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:02,857
Holy shit! Homeboy's got the federales in hot pursuit.

941
00:50:05,817 --> 00:50:06,998
Police cars chasing us!

942
00:50:06,999 --> 00:50:08,041
We're in a fucking car chase.

943
00:50:08,042 --> 00:50:09,084
Well, we just rob a bank.

944
00:50:18,235 --> 00:50:19,739
I do this for a living.

945
00:50:19,741 --> 00:50:23,013
No, you don't. You get high and deliver pizzas,
That's nothing like this situation.

946
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:45,951
What are you doing?

947
00:50:46,759 --> 00:50:48,827
My move, i'm gonna bang in 180
we'll be by in the opposite direction.

948
00:50:48,828 --> 00:50:49,870
No, please don't bang.
No need for a bang!

949
00:51:28,929 --> 00:51:31,889
Are you okay?
- yeah.

950
00:51:38,604 --> 00:51:41,731
Take the money,
take the money.

951
00:51:42,889 --> 00:51:45,505
Look at this.

952
00:51:46,063 --> 00:51:51,468
Mr.Fisher is not gonna be pleased about this.

953
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:56,457
I'm trying to get away...Okay.

954
00:51:57,062 --> 00:51:59,042
Hold on, hold on.
you got a piece of the car stuck in you.

955
00:52:01,321 --> 00:52:03,114
Get it out! Get it out!

956
00:52:04,292 --> 00:52:09,546
I gonna get tetanus?

957
00:52:11,251 --> 00:52:12,934
What should we do now?

958
00:52:13,753 --> 00:52:14,858
Slow down, slow down.

959
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:43,069
Hey, You know what happened
to the guys they were after?

960
00:52:43,287 --> 00:52:44,905
Sounds like they got away.

961
00:52:45,332 --> 00:52:46,395
That's terrible.
I hope that they catch them.

962
00:52:49,705 --> 00:52:52,310
There's a 100 grand in there.

963
00:52:52,311 --> 00:52:54,916
100 fucking grand.
Which we stole.

964
00:52:54,918 --> 00:52:57,539
From a bank.

965
00:52:57,889 --> 00:52:58,694
I told a bunch of people I was gonna shoot em.

966
00:52:58,696 --> 00:52:59,522
I was like..

967
00:52:59,913 --> 00:53:01,817
"you fucking move,
and I will kill you where you stand!"

968
00:53:01,819 --> 00:53:02,861
I threatened to blow up a guy.

969
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:05,348
And you never said
"I will kill you where you stand."

970
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:07,721
Yeah, I know.
But shit did get pretty crazy.

971
00:53:08,043 --> 00:53:09,273
I held my gun, sidewise at one point.

972
00:53:09,274 --> 00:53:10,316
Yeah, you did.

973
00:53:12,297 --> 00:53:14,382
Man, there's no one I would have
rather taken down a bank with.

974
00:53:14,383 --> 00:53:15,425
I mean that.

975
00:53:15,289 --> 00:53:16,873
Me, neither.

976
00:53:18,416 --> 00:53:19,719
And as for all that shit I said...

977
00:53:20,345 --> 00:53:22,485
all that shit I did...
I just hope you can forgive me.

978
00:53:23,299 --> 00:53:25,686
I'm sorry i've been such a dick.
I don't think there'll be anybody be friends with me.

979
00:53:25,722 --> 00:53:27,672
C'mon, you're talking to a guy

980
00:53:27,674 --> 00:53:32,349
who slept with his best friend's ex- girlfriend,
who split up his parents' marriage,

981
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:34,740
and sat on the sidelines watching his downward spiral.

982
00:53:34,741 --> 00:53:37,589
I mean, those are actions of a shitty human being.

983
00:53:37,626 --> 00:53:39,214
I don't know
who else would be best friend with me.

984
00:53:40,429 --> 00:53:42,436
- Well, then its a good fucking thing
that we know each other.

985
00:53:42,961 --> 00:53:43,648
Come here..

986
00:53:45,058 --> 00:53:47,612
You're right. Let's take care of that.
But you owe me a hug.

987
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,885
It's all gravy from here.

988
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:00,492
100 thousand dollars,
Done and done!

989
00:54:13,264 --> 00:54:14,800
This who I think it is?

990
00:54:15,184 --> 00:54:17,299
- Can't you hear the ticking in the background?

991
00:54:17,236 --> 00:54:18,539
Funny guy, huh?

992
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,666
Well, Can it. This shit ain't over yet.

993
00:54:21,146 --> 00:54:22,198
Save the fucking routine.

994
00:54:23,575 --> 00:54:26,702
There's an old railroad bridge out  on Commerce ,
past the highway.

995
00:54:26,703 --> 00:54:27,745
Be there in 20.

996
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,349
I'll be there in ten.

997
00:54:28,985 --> 00:54:32,448
- Well, then you'll be standing there with
your dick in one hand, and my money in the other.

998
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:33,492
- No, You will.

999
00:54:34,761 --> 00:54:35,688
He heard it.

1000
00:54:36,241 --> 00:54:37,658
Fucking asshole.

1001
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:40,620
Yo, Juicy,

1002
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,716
wrangle your boy.

1003
00:54:44,217 --> 00:54:45,728
Money's on its way.

1004
00:54:48,108 --> 00:54:49,017
God damn!

1005
00:54:49,053 --> 00:54:50,256
How good does this feel huh?

1006
00:54:53,933 --> 00:54:55,163
I'm not ashamed to admit it Travis.

1007
00:54:56,008 --> 00:54:58,103
I've had some dark times this last few years.

1008
00:54:58,791 --> 00:55:02,742
Depression. Anorexia...Addiction...

1009
00:55:03,629 --> 00:55:05,609
All kinds of shit that i'm not even going into.

1010
00:55:06,569 --> 00:55:08,018
Starting today, all that shits is the past.

1011
00:55:09,477 --> 00:55:10,613
I'm finally fucking done it man.

1012
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:12,646
I finally pulled it off.

1013
00:55:13,721 --> 00:55:16,606
Yeah, I mean..
we did, dude. Together, you and me.

1014
00:55:16,607 --> 00:55:17,649
We make a pretty good team.

1015
00:55:19,142 --> 00:55:20,716
- Do we?
- Yeah, dude.

1016
00:55:23,301 --> 00:55:24,426
Alright, than...

1017
00:55:25,418 --> 00:55:26,596
Would you do it?

1018
00:55:28,316 --> 00:55:29,466
Would you push the button?

1019
00:55:31,067 --> 00:55:32,200
- Why would you want me to do that?

1020
00:55:32,202 --> 00:55:33,244
-  It's just a question, Travis.

1021
00:55:33,245 --> 00:55:36,253
- I thought you said nobody gets hurt, Dwayne?

1022
00:55:38,064 --> 00:55:39,919
- He hasn't even made the drop, anyway.

1023
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:44,927
So, I wouldn't ask you to blow him up right now.
That'll be stupid.

1024
00:55:44,929 --> 00:55:45,971
Not while we're eating tacos.

1025
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:49,688
I gotta take a shit, dude!

1026
00:56:00,092 --> 00:56:01,374
Wait, did you tell the guy,
you're bringing a friend?

1027
00:56:02,052 --> 00:56:03,358
No.

1028
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:07,121
What if he gets freaked out,
and decided to shoot me?

1029
00:56:07,265 --> 00:56:09,389
You wanna go?
- Yes.

1030
00:56:09,391 --> 00:56:10,433
You got my blessing.

1031
00:56:32,828 --> 00:56:36,020
Hey, Wat's up bro?
How're you doing?

1032
00:56:36,498 --> 00:56:37,535
Where are the other guys?

1033
00:56:38,438 --> 00:56:39,480
It's just me Dawg!

1034
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:41,730
You call me Sugar milk, bro.

1035
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:45,234
You got the money?

1036
00:56:47,663 --> 00:56:49,404
Oh my God, it's so pretty,

1037
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,333
it's so pretty, bro.
Look at it!

1038
00:56:53,032 --> 00:56:54,939
Oh my God! What's he do?
Rob a bank?

1039
00:56:54,941 --> 00:56:55,983
Yeah.

1040
00:56:56,744 --> 00:56:58,151
You did?
- Yeah.

1041
00:56:58,797 --> 00:57:00,971
That's cool man!
I'm proud of you, brother.

1042
00:57:01,294 --> 00:57:02,088
Check you later!

1043
00:57:02,394 --> 00:57:03,457
Hey, man..where's the code?

1044
00:57:05,981 --> 00:57:07,753
I don't know no code,
What's you talking about like, what code?

1045
00:57:09,046 --> 00:57:10,630
C'mon man, just give me the code. Okay?

1046
00:57:11,652 --> 00:57:12,771
Like the vinci code, Code Red?

1047
00:57:14,258 --> 00:57:16,551
Like the contra code, select...select.
AB AB??

1048
00:57:17,104 --> 00:57:20,043
That one?
- Okay dude! Stop messing with me.

1049
00:57:20,586 --> 00:57:22,100
NO, I don't have no code, Bro.

1050
00:57:22,242 --> 00:57:24,415
Give me the fucking code,
for the bomb, okay!

1051
00:57:24,417 --> 00:57:28,316
Who brings a fucking bomb to a drop, Homie?

1052
00:57:28,551 --> 00:57:29,635
I don't know,
Your fucking boss put this on me.

1053
00:57:30,073 --> 00:57:31,247
I am my boss.

1054
00:57:31,302 --> 00:57:32,565
Fine, Then give me the code!

1055
00:57:32,566 --> 00:57:34,491
Say code again, motherfucker!
Please, say one more time.

1056
00:57:35,286 --> 00:57:37,891
I'll just shoot you in the face,
I'll shoot you in the face,

1057
00:57:37,892 --> 00:57:39,996
So, that you don't explode and mess up my shit.

1058
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:41,040
But say code just one more time,
I just wanna hear it.

1059
00:57:42,026 --> 00:57:43,114
I want that money back.

1060
00:57:43,528 --> 00:57:44,529
Oh you want this money right here?

1061
00:57:44,632 --> 00:57:47,319
This motherfucking money right here,
the one that you just gave to me, huh?

1062
00:57:48,043 --> 00:57:50,180
- Yes! Give me the money back.

1063
00:57:49,532 --> 00:57:51,924
The only way you're get is if you kill me. Homie.

1064
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:53,430
Which you ain't gonna do,
Cos you're a pussy.

1065
00:57:53,431 --> 00:57:55,240
You don't know what I've gone through
for that money!

1066
00:57:55,278 --> 00:57:58,175
Do I fucking look sympathetic, homie?
Now step the fuck aside.

1067
00:57:59,087 --> 00:58:00,134
watch out!

1068
00:58:32,188 --> 00:58:32,815
What the fuck was that?

1069
00:58:33,418 --> 00:58:35,232
They tried to screw us, man.
You're a liability.

1070
00:58:35,233 --> 00:58:36,275
They were just gonna let you blow up.

1071
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,220
Not with the money they won't.

1072
00:58:38,222 --> 00:58:40,949
I'm gonna call that motherfucker!

1073
00:58:42,076 --> 00:58:43,598
Yeah, shit's looking good.

1074
00:58:44,166 --> 00:58:46,925
You're still making it look too boxy man!
I'm not trying to look like Arsinio Hall..

1075
00:58:46,927 --> 00:58:47,969
when I go down to the morgue
and fucking identify the body.

1076
00:58:56,249 --> 00:58:57,467
- So, Did you drop the money?

1077
00:58:57,469 --> 00:59:00,233
No!  I've still got the money!
And I cracked your friend's face open!

1078
00:59:00,826 --> 00:59:02,035
Why the fuck would you do that!?

1079
00:59:02,036 --> 00:59:04,135
You lied!  You said I'd get the code!

1080
00:59:04,694 --> 00:59:07,227
He did not gave you the code?
- I gave him the code.

1081
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:10,106
I want the code right now
or you'll never see this money!

1082
00:59:10,108 --> 00:59:11,986
- Just settle down, Bigboy alright?

1083
00:59:11,987 --> 00:59:14,472
You're not exactly negotiating
from a point of leverage, here.

1084
00:59:14,474 --> 00:59:15,516
I'm holding the money. Okay?

1085
00:59:15,458 --> 00:59:18,063
I blow up, and it blows up.
Who has the leverage now?

1086
00:59:18,064 --> 00:59:21,476
Why don't you go ahead and press the button,
press the button, asshole. Push it!

1087
00:59:24,001 --> 00:59:24,882
Watch what the fuck you saying!

1088
00:59:25,513 --> 00:59:28,118
I own you, alright!
I tell you to rob a bank, and you rob a fucking bank.

1089
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:31,332
If tell you to give me the money, and you give me
the goddamn money and you hope

1090
00:59:32,056 --> 00:59:32,867
that I give you mercy.

1091
00:59:32,904 --> 00:59:33,540
I'm tired of this bullshit.

1092
00:59:33,542 --> 00:59:34,584
I'm already dead, right?
So fuck you.

1093
00:59:34,585 --> 00:59:35,627
At least I'll die rich.

1094
00:59:35,629 --> 00:59:36,671
I can't say the same for you.

1095
00:59:38,138 --> 00:59:39,405
Get me out of this car!

1096
00:59:39,691 --> 00:59:42,337
Pull over! Get me out of the car, right now!

1097
00:59:45,973 --> 00:59:48,863
Chet, get back in the car!

1098
00:59:49,554 --> 00:59:52,159
Why? That was so stupid!

1099
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,765
That was a negotiation tactic, Okay.
He'll call back and I won't answer.

1100
00:59:54,767 --> 00:59:57,706
Then he'll call back and I will answer,
and he'll realize the only way he gets the money..

1101
00:59:58,103 --> 00:59:59,419
is if he gives me the code.

1102
00:59:59,421 --> 01:00:01,506
Okay,  I'm sure that's exactly what he'll do!

1103
01:00:01,507 --> 01:00:03,889
Oh wait, no. He's not,
cos he's fucking psychotic!

1104
01:00:08,872 --> 01:00:10,915
Now, he's not gonna answer.
He's gonna pretend like I don't exist.

1105
01:00:13,908 --> 01:00:15,701
Does this guy know who the fuck I am!?

1106
01:00:22,675 --> 01:00:23,665
Dwayne...

1107
01:00:24,906 --> 01:00:27,511
you never told me
you weren't going to give him the code.

1108
01:00:27,513 --> 01:00:30,118
We're not amateurs, Travis.
Alright..He's a fucking loose end, man!

1109
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:33,006
Do you know, what's gonna happen,
if the loose end goes away?

1110
01:00:33,486 --> 01:00:36,091
I could just be sitting in my fucking mansion,
FBI,

1111
01:00:36,093 --> 01:00:38,698
CIA, fucking NASA...will converge then,

1112
01:00:38,699 --> 01:00:42,118
Because he'll turn state's evidence.
And they can fucking lock me away!

1113
01:00:43,724 --> 01:00:44,797
You know what?

1114
01:00:45,653 --> 01:00:48,663
Fuck that, fuck it!
I'll just kill The Major myself.

1115
01:00:48,665 --> 01:00:49,707
I don't need a fucking hitman.

1116
01:00:49,708 --> 01:00:50,750
Don't do it..man.

1117
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:54,002
I gave him chances..he fucking blew it.

1118
01:00:54,003 --> 01:00:56,690
He wants to be a fucking big man.
He's gonna fucking die now.

1119
01:00:56,692 --> 01:00:57,734
Dwayne, Don't!

1120
01:00:57,736 --> 01:01:01,408
- Three, Two...One.

1121
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:02,452
Boom.

1122
01:01:01,697 --> 01:01:04,324
Just killed somebody.

1123
01:01:05,476 --> 01:01:07,210
Hello, and welcome to MovieFone!

1124
01:01:08,307 --> 01:01:10,371
To use our new speech enable system,
Press Start 2

1125
01:01:11,539 --> 01:01:13,869
Travis, why the fuck was that Moviefone?

1126
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:14,912
What's the number for the bomb?

1127
01:01:16,626 --> 01:01:19,231
Its  In my head..man.
Alright, I switched it out

1128
01:01:19,233 --> 01:01:22,954
while you were taking a shit at Taco Boy, alright?
You're out of control, Dwayne.

1129
01:01:23,915 --> 01:01:24,957
I'm out of control?
- Yeah.

1130
01:01:24,842 --> 01:01:27,447
I'm in perfect fucking control!

1131
01:01:37,675 --> 01:01:40,280
You motherfucker...

1132
01:01:40,282 --> 01:01:42,818
I'm thinking about business partner
and you pull this shit with me?

1133
01:01:42,819 --> 01:01:45,403
I'm just tired of you pushing me around, Dwayne!

1134
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,725
What kinda partner does that!?

1135
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:49,726
Fuck you...I'm gonna probably piss blood, Now.

1136
01:01:50,425 --> 01:01:51,728
Yeah, That's what it said on the internet.

1137
01:01:55,013 --> 01:01:57,327
Would you get the phone out of my pocket.
I don't think I can make it straight.

1138
01:02:00,726 --> 01:02:02,612
Just put on the table.
On speakerphone.

1139
01:02:05,605 --> 01:02:07,981
Glad to see you finally came to your senses.
Asshole!

1140
01:02:07,983 --> 01:02:10,455
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to, bro!?

1141
01:02:12,892 --> 01:02:15,497
Honestly, I  have no idea.
Who's this?

1142
01:02:15,498 --> 01:02:18,486
Let me give you a hint:
your barn boy just jumped me,

1143
01:02:18,488 --> 01:02:21,598
tossed my bitch like a fucking rag doll
and split with the cash.

1144
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,642
Does that ring a bell?

1145
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:25,010
That's not my boy.
That dude's a dick!

1146
01:02:25,011 --> 01:02:28,837
I'm sorry for all the, uh, confusion
that he might've cause us today.

1147
01:02:28,839 --> 01:02:29,881
Confusion?

1148
01:02:29,192 --> 01:02:31,797
The only motherfucker who looks confused is you.

1149
01:02:31,798 --> 01:02:34,911
Cos Apparently,
you think you can fuck me and survive the day.

1150
01:02:34,912 --> 01:02:36,901
No, no no. I'm not trying
to fuck up your world.

1151
01:02:36,938 --> 01:02:38,602
I'm trying to fuck up his world.

1152
01:02:38,604 --> 01:02:39,646
Man, you just gotta understand.

1153
01:02:39,648 --> 01:02:42,987
You're just like a pawn
in a much larger game I'm playing here.

1154
01:02:43,282 --> 01:02:45,702
A pawn?
Did you just fucking call me a pawn, Homie?

1155
01:02:45,704 --> 01:02:48,384
I'm not a chess piece,
I'm like a fucking battle ship!

1156
01:02:48,448 --> 01:02:49,692
I didn't mean it that way.

1157
01:02:49,693 --> 01:02:52,185
Look, I'm just juggling a whole lot of shit.
Right now, alright?

1158
01:02:52,223 --> 01:02:54,269
I want my money.  Right now.

1159
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:56,205
Well, I don't have the money right now.

1160
01:02:56,207 --> 01:02:57,249
But if you give me a little bit time.

1161
01:02:56,876 --> 01:02:58,764
I think I can probably come up with it.

1162
01:02:58,766 --> 01:02:59,808
You know what?
The deal is off!

1163
01:02:59,483 --> 01:03:01,938
You just became the hit.
Congratulation, motherfucker!

1164
01:03:06,019 --> 01:03:07,624
What did he say?
Are we good?

1165
01:03:08,793 --> 01:03:10,461
He says, he is gonna kill me.

1166
01:03:11,034 --> 01:03:13,796
The fucking assassin is now going to kill me.

1167
01:03:14,412 --> 01:03:16,117
Oh shit!
Are you serious?

1168
01:03:16,119 --> 01:03:19,115
He's gonna fucking shoot me now.
I'm gonna die. Game over!

1169
01:03:19,135 --> 01:03:21,097
C'mon man. Don't say that, Dwayne.

1170
01:03:21,098 --> 01:03:23,436
We're gonna get that money.
Just like we planned..Okay?

1171
01:03:23,544 --> 01:03:25,472
We just have to get the leverage back.

1172
01:03:26,015 --> 01:03:27,161
How do we do that?

1173
01:03:27,767 --> 01:03:29,362
We hit that pizza fucking, where it hurts.

1174
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:31,061
What, in his dick?

1175
01:03:32,281 --> 01:03:33,479
No, in his pussy!

1176
01:03:39,579 --> 01:03:41,369
I really don't think,
this is gonna work man.

1177
01:03:41,370 --> 01:03:42,412
I know, Please..
let's just try it once.

1178
01:03:42,706 --> 01:03:46,313
Alright, I'll try. If it doesn't work..
No more negotiations tactics, you call the guy..okay?

1179
01:03:46,741 --> 01:03:51,353
Alright..Three..Two.
One.

1180
01:03:52,707 --> 01:03:53,654
Fuck!

1181
01:03:53,691 --> 01:03:54,389
Fuck man!!!

1182
01:03:54,426 --> 01:03:55,395
It's not working!

1183
01:03:55,432 --> 01:03:56,981
- Yeah, cos your arms are there.

1184
01:03:56,983 --> 01:03:58,025
I told you, you have to cut your arms.

1185
01:03:58,026 --> 01:03:59,745
But.. you have to have your arms.

1186
01:03:59,746 --> 01:04:00,788
-Okay, I will try him.

1187
01:04:04,352 --> 01:04:06,171
(Voice mail)
Yo! This is the king..leave a fucking message.

1188
01:04:06,208 --> 01:04:06,976
It went straight to voice-mail.

1189
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,752
- What are we gonna do, man?

1190
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:11,619
If those guys don't pick up?

1191
01:04:12,054 --> 01:04:14,316
You're gonna explode!
In an hour you will be dead.

1192
01:04:16,109 --> 01:04:17,120
- Alright, I'll call him again.

1193
01:04:36,084 --> 01:04:38,689
That's right.

1194
01:04:38,690 --> 01:04:41,295
Shits just got real for you, Slumdog.

1195
01:04:43,241 --> 01:04:44,337
- Who the fuck are you?

1196
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:45,381
- Get her!

1197
01:04:57,664 --> 01:04:58,675
Dwayne?

1198
01:05:33,736 --> 01:05:35,746
Chill out right there, Homie.

1199
01:05:35,747 --> 01:05:36,789
Chill out right there.

1200
01:05:39,731 --> 01:05:41,326
- i'm gonna walk you through it.

1201
01:05:42,347 --> 01:05:44,338
I'm just here for Dwayne, Okay?
that's it.

1202
01:05:44,964 --> 01:05:46,996
- Even if I knew where he was,
I wouldn't tell you nothing.

1203
01:05:47,498 --> 01:05:48,686
- Don't be stupid..Bro.

1204
01:05:48,687 --> 01:05:51,088
C'mon, tell me.

1205
01:05:52,783 --> 01:05:54,711
- You know, I saved a beaner's life in the shit.

1206
01:05:55,588 --> 01:05:57,130
So if I took yours,
we'd be even.

1207
01:05:58,038 --> 01:05:59,132
- A beaner..huh?

1208
01:05:59,945 --> 01:06:01,998
That shit cuts deep,
I'm not gonna lie.

1209
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:03,375
That was good.

1210
01:06:04,418 --> 01:06:05,669
- Why you're trying to protect him?

1211
01:06:06,419 --> 01:06:08,738
- He hired me to kill you..motherfucker!

1212
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:09,782
- Sounds like my son.

1213
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:16,393
- Where the fuck is he?

1214
01:06:18,551 --> 01:06:21,274
- You think i'm scared of dead..huh?

1215
01:06:21,672 --> 01:06:24,914
There's a whole generation of gooks
that think I'm the grim reaper.

1216
01:06:27,062 --> 01:06:29,667
Come here, You!

1217
01:06:31,771 --> 01:06:32,273
I'll ride you all the way to hell!

1218
01:06:32,274 --> 01:06:34,879
And, I know exactly how to get there!

1219
01:06:40,688 --> 01:06:41,949
Are you for sure done?

1220
01:06:42,689 --> 01:06:45,120
Nobody can fucking kill to me bro!

1221
01:06:45,121 --> 01:06:46,163
- Go ahead and shoot.

1222
01:06:53,605 --> 01:06:55,981
- Really? A fucking pen gun?

1223
01:06:56,743 --> 01:06:59,682
Motherfucker!

1224
01:07:07,053 --> 01:07:09,658
You're a fucking bad ass, bro.
You're a pimp.

1225
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:12,130
Okay, remember?
You are a pimp. That's what your Ma said.

1226
01:07:12,735 --> 01:07:14,038
Ma told you, you're a pimp?

1227
01:07:18,594 --> 01:07:20,063
You're a pimp!

1228
01:07:48,822 --> 01:07:50,161
What the fuck is this shit?

1229
01:07:50,829 --> 01:07:52,285
Is that a bank?

1230
01:07:53,933 --> 01:07:55,261
I guess, we just became a bank robber.

1231
01:07:55,262 --> 01:07:56,304
Or pretty good at it.

1232
01:07:56,417 --> 01:07:58,176
This shit just don't make shit!

1233
01:07:58,178 --> 01:07:59,220
Bank robbers make banks.

1234
01:08:02,016 --> 01:08:03,089
Don't mess this up.

1235
01:08:04,069 --> 01:08:05,719
- You ready to talk now?

1236
01:08:05,721 --> 01:08:07,682
- Yeah, I'm ready to talk.
I want my fucking money!!!

1237
01:08:07,718 --> 01:08:09,510
- Good, then give me the fucking code, right now!

1238
01:08:09,511 --> 01:08:10,553
I will disarm this thing. I will...

1239
01:08:10,648 --> 01:08:12,751
I will leave the money some place,
and you can come and get it.

1240
01:08:12,753 --> 01:08:14,641
You'll just have to trust me when I say that
I don't want it!!!

1241
01:08:14,642 --> 01:08:15,684
- Yeah, I'm sure.

1242
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:18,414
You're just so ready to get back to your fantastic life.

1243
01:08:18,416 --> 01:08:18,954
Huh?

1244
01:08:18,956 --> 01:08:19,998
Your awesome job!

1245
01:08:20,124 --> 01:08:22,113
And that sweetheart little bitch of yours!?

1246
01:08:22,115 --> 01:08:23,992
- What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

1247
01:08:24,206 --> 01:08:25,816
You know that little lady,
you paid a visit to, today?

1248
01:08:26,656 --> 01:08:27,637
Well, guess what?

1249
01:08:27,638 --> 01:08:28,680
She's sitting in the back of my van,
Right now.

1250
01:08:28,682 --> 01:08:31,057
Let's just say, it's not consensual.

1251
01:08:31,118 --> 01:08:32,945
- Fuck you!  You just crossed a line!

1252
01:08:32,947 --> 01:08:33,989
- There are no lines!

1253
01:08:34,459 --> 01:08:35,840
There's just me and you
and 100 thousand dollars.

1254
01:08:36,430 --> 01:08:39,145
The sooner, you figure that shit out.
The soon you'll get her back...

1255
01:08:39,146 --> 01:08:40,188
And your life back!

1256
01:08:40,574 --> 01:08:42,586
You're gonna meet me in the scrap yard..
Alone!

1257
01:08:43,081 --> 01:08:44,941
if you try anything crazy!!

1258
01:08:46,257 --> 01:08:47,299
Then, both of you are
delivering pizzas to Saint Peter.

1259
01:08:47,376 --> 01:08:48,658
- Let me talk to her.

1260
01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:51,404
- He wants to talk.

1261
01:08:51,406 --> 01:08:53,274
- He wants to talk to me?
What do I say???

1262
01:08:53,275 --> 01:08:54,317
- To her!
He wants to talk to her.

1263
01:08:55,740 --> 01:08:57,060
- Why the fuck
would he wants to talk to you?

1264
01:08:57,062 --> 01:08:58,104
- Right, sorry.

1265
01:08:58,106 --> 01:08:59,148
- Nick?

1266
01:08:59,303 --> 01:09:00,793
- Kate, I'm so sorry.

1267
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:06,161
-  It's okay...I'm fine...
I'm just really scared.

1268
01:09:06,163 --> 01:09:07,516
- Enough, she's wasting my minutes.

1269
01:09:08,769 --> 01:09:10,343
- She's just really gonna die..
if you fuck this up.

1270
01:09:11,375 --> 01:09:11,501
Got it?

1271
01:09:11,538 --> 01:09:12,972
Fuck!

1272
01:09:12,974 --> 01:09:15,677
- Nick, What going on?

1273
01:09:16,234 --> 01:09:17,641
Who are you talking to?

1274
01:09:18,475 --> 01:09:21,800
- I uh..I fucked up, Chet.

1275
01:09:21,802 --> 01:09:22,844
- What did you do?

1276
01:09:22,624 --> 01:09:23,697
- When we went into town, earlier.

1277
01:09:24,428 --> 01:09:27,221
It wasn't just to tell off my boss.
I mean, I did that too. But uh...

1278
01:09:29,025 --> 01:09:30,458
I saw Kate.

1279
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:32,394
- While you had a bomb strapped to your chess?

1280
01:09:32,396 --> 01:09:33,438
Are you fucking kidding me!

1281
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:34,482
- Look, i thought I was being careful..Okay?

1282
01:09:35,583 --> 01:09:38,168
I went to see her on a roof!
I case, i fucking exploded!!!!

1283
01:09:38,752 --> 01:09:40,582
Those guys followed me..
I had no idea that they were there.

1284
01:09:40,724 --> 01:09:41,423
- Of course, you didn't!

1285
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,824
- I helped you robbed a bank, man!

1286
01:09:48,166 --> 01:09:50,771
I put a gun upto people's faces..
I committed a crime...I could go to jail..

1287
01:09:50,773 --> 01:09:52,558
And my whole life could be over!

1288
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:53,602
- okay, I know i fucked up okay?

1289
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,309
But we have the money, okay?

1290
01:09:57,987 --> 01:09:59,675
And as long as we have the money.

1291
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:01,114
She's safe.

1292
01:10:03,377 --> 01:10:04,440
- Let's just stop arguing,

1293
01:10:05,457 --> 01:10:11,269
and go get her.

1294
01:11:03,667 --> 01:11:06,002
Hey! Hello??

1295
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:10,130
- I'm here! I made it.

1296
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,289
- How much time you got left?

1297
01:11:14,822 --> 01:11:16,102
- Four minutes..and nine seconds.

1298
01:11:16,103 --> 01:11:17,145
- That's cutting a little close.

1299
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:22,338
- I got the cash, so give me the coat..
and Kate.

1300
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:24,997
- Or maybe we could just chill out..
and wait for the money shot.

1301
01:11:25,508 --> 01:11:26,790
- That's very funny.
Now, give me the fucking code.

1302
01:11:29,417 --> 01:11:30,918
- 69..69..

1303
01:11:31,596 --> 01:11:32,669
.69.

1304
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:35,390
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.

1305
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:36,433
- Oh man, don't judge me!

1306
01:11:37,153 --> 01:11:38,216
Its my favourite sexual position.

1307
01:11:53,145 --> 01:11:55,137
- Yeah, how does that feel?

1308
01:11:55,139 --> 01:11:56,181
Freeman!

1309
01:11:56,182 --> 01:11:57,224
- I'm not free yet.

1310
01:11:58,181 --> 01:11:59,327
Where's she?

1311
01:12:04,461 --> 01:12:05,070
- C'mon Travis!
What the fuck, Dude?

1312
01:12:05,072 --> 01:12:06,884
This is the signal!

1313
01:12:06,886 --> 01:12:09,658
- I'm coming,
she knocked over my soda!

1314
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:10,233
- Kate!

1315
01:12:10,270 --> 01:12:11,451
- Nick, is that you?

1316
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:12,494
- Yeah, yeah I'm here.
It's gonna be okay.

1317
01:12:12,385 --> 01:12:13,543
This fucking fuels are greasening.

1318
01:12:13,545 --> 01:12:14,587
- Yo, come on man..
Just let her go.

1319
01:12:14,992 --> 01:12:17,597
- Yeah, I will. In time....
I want you to know my associate here...

1320
01:12:17,598 --> 01:12:19,304
He's wrapping a flame thrower.

1321
01:12:19,306 --> 01:12:22,280
- Be cool man...
Do not be crazy.

1322
01:12:22,316 --> 01:12:24,884
- Yeah, unless you think,
you can out run a 25 foot flame.

1323
01:12:24,886 --> 01:12:25,928
or a bullet.

1324
01:12:25,683 --> 01:12:27,345
- Which, You can..FYI.

1325
01:12:27,347 --> 01:12:28,389
- No, it's impossible.

1326
01:12:28,425 --> 01:12:29,278
- You want the money?

1327
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:30,401
Yes, okay.

1328
01:12:30,835 --> 01:12:31,466
- Then, give me the girl.

1329
01:12:31,468 --> 01:12:33,464
- We'll meet in the middle.
- Yeah, sure.

1330
01:12:33,465 --> 01:12:34,507
- Move, woman!

1331
01:12:35,222 --> 01:12:37,827
- Alright! I'll count to three.

1332
01:12:37,828 --> 01:12:40,433
- One, Two..three.

1333
01:12:48,274 --> 01:12:51,095
Alright, you love birds!
You guys can go ahead and go home, now.

1334
01:12:51,288 --> 01:12:52,330
It's all over!

1335
01:12:52,538 --> 01:12:55,215
- You know, I actually have this sneaking suspicion
that once we turn around,

1336
01:12:55,217 --> 01:12:56,259
you're gonna put a bullet in both of our backs-

1337
01:12:57,772 --> 01:12:59,582
And uh..this is just a guess -
He's gonna burn our bodies.

1338
01:13:00,378 --> 01:13:03,134
- Well, They say great minds think alike.
I guess, in this case, so do we.

1339
01:13:04,658 --> 01:13:05,658
- No, I know..I figured that.

1340
01:13:05,695 --> 01:13:07,966
That's why I got a gun pointed at you, too.

1341
01:13:07,968 --> 01:13:11,867
I got a sniper and he's locked on you right now.
His name's Cruz...

1342
01:13:12,081 --> 01:13:13,212
and he's a local motherfucker.

1343
01:13:14,181 --> 01:13:15,048
Hey, Cruz!

1344
01:13:16,925 --> 01:13:18,128
- Yeah, right.
Bullshit!

1345
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:20,332
How dumb do I look?

1346
01:13:20,656 --> 01:13:22,282
Nice try...Yeah, a Sniper.

1347
01:13:23,502 --> 01:13:25,941
- Holy shit Dwayne...on your forehead.

1348
01:13:26,483 --> 01:13:28,286
There's a red dot on your forehead.
You look like one of her people.

1349
01:13:29,131 --> 01:13:30,361
- There's a what?

1350
01:13:31,216 --> 01:13:33,695
Shit! Oh you sonofabitch!!!

1351
01:13:33,732 --> 01:13:34,472
- Thank you, Cruz!

1352
01:13:34,473 --> 01:13:35,515
- Well played.

1353
01:13:35,517 --> 01:13:36,559
- Alright, drop the gun.

1354
01:13:40,589 --> 01:13:41,756
Okay and you too.

1355
01:13:42,173 --> 01:13:44,414
- I can't put it down, it's attached to my backpack.
I'll just point it down?

1356
01:13:44,884 --> 01:13:46,135
- Yeah, that's fine. Whatever.

1357
01:13:46,136 --> 01:13:47,178
- Thanks!

1358
01:13:46,646 --> 01:13:48,188
- We're gonna walk away,

1359
01:13:48,898 --> 01:13:51,074
But if you try anything,
My sniper will shoot you.

1360
01:13:51,076 --> 01:13:52,118
- Oh you are so tough huh?

1361
01:13:52,495 --> 01:13:54,434
You had to use a sniper, to out do us.

1362
01:13:54,778 --> 01:13:57,582
Its a pussy move!
Suck it!

1363
01:13:58,218 --> 01:13:59,634
- Who cares, we got the money.

1364
01:13:59,636 --> 01:14:00,678
- Yeah, fuck them!

1365
01:14:00,115 --> 01:14:06,870
Hey, Wasn't expecting to see you here.

1366
01:14:07,226 --> 01:14:09,831
- Whoa, whoa!!!
- Don't leave the party just yet.

1367
01:14:09,832 --> 01:14:10,932
Hold up!

1368
01:14:11,366 --> 01:14:12,653
- Who the fuck are you?

1369
01:14:12,690 --> 01:14:15,930
I'm the motherfucking satanic...hispanic dawggy.

1370
01:14:16,473 --> 01:14:19,078
We were looking for you man.

1371
01:14:19,079 --> 01:14:20,140
We got all your money, right here.

1372
01:14:20,301 --> 01:14:20,943
Alright, throw it down.

1373
01:14:24,052 --> 01:14:26,877
Hey, what the fuck? We paid you your fucking money,
put the fun down.

1374
01:14:27,571 --> 01:14:30,080
- It's very disappointing
the way you guys do business.

1375
01:14:30,081 --> 01:14:31,123
It's fucked up bro.

1376
01:14:31,125 --> 01:14:32,167
I got shot with a pen, today!

1377
01:14:32,168 --> 01:14:34,209
With a fucking pen! Bro...

1378
01:14:34,436 --> 01:14:35,565
Right in my neck!

1379
01:14:35,566 --> 01:14:38,345
And I got hit in the face, with a fucking crowbar,
or something like that.

1380
