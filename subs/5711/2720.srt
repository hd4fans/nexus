1
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:08,534
Are you alright?

2
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:09,587
l'm fine

3
00:03:13,588 --> 00:03:14,596
What's wrong?

4
00:03:14,668 --> 00:03:15,699
Nothing

5
00:03:15,746 --> 00:03:17,893
He almost ran into me with the cart

6
00:03:17,938 --> 00:03:20,014
Looks like he's sick

7
00:03:44,068 --> 00:03:47,022
Pull him over!

8
00:03:49,287 --> 00:03:52,276
You have stepped onto our side

9
00:03:52,348 --> 00:03:55,337
l didn't mean to

10
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,522
l'm too sick and weak to handle the cart

11
00:03:57,602 --> 00:04:00,448
Please let me go

12
00:04:00,525 --> 00:04:01,663
Let him go...

13
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:02,608
Let me go...

14
00:04:02,682 --> 00:04:03,749
How about it?

15
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,712
l'll let you go

16
00:04:06,753 --> 00:04:07,856
Thanks

17
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:09,977
Not so fast...

18
00:04:10,058 --> 00:04:13,248
Chop it off!

19
00:04:35,004 --> 00:04:39,132
Fight!

20
00:04:39,285 --> 00:04:42,202
Don't fight!

21
00:04:44,364 --> 00:04:46,581
Meng Feng, that's too much

22
00:04:47,391 --> 00:04:49,716
No one should be killed merely for crossing the border

23
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:52,852
How cocky you are!

24
00:04:53,619 --> 00:04:55,979
What do you want?

25
00:04:56,785 --> 00:04:59,002
Quiet, please!

26
00:05:00,995 --> 00:05:03,177
Perhaps we have over reacted

27
00:05:03,222 --> 00:05:05,203
But according to custom

28
00:05:05,274 --> 00:05:08,334
Not only do we confiscate the offender's belongings

29
00:05:08,371 --> 00:05:11,360
he has to go kowtow at our ancestral shrine

30
00:05:11,432 --> 00:05:14,527
before we hack off his limbs

31
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:16,710
Cutting his leg off on the street

32
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,843
is indeed too much

33
00:05:19,992 --> 00:05:22,044
but that's his rotten luck

34
00:05:25,002 --> 00:05:26,105
This is outrageous!

35
00:05:45,809 --> 00:05:46,840
Go!

36
00:06:13,921 --> 00:06:16,068
Master!

37
00:06:16,148 --> 00:06:17,215
Uncle!

38
00:06:25,437 --> 00:06:27,619
Don't fight, stop!

39
00:06:31,874 --> 00:06:32,941
Stop!

40
00:06:44,295 --> 00:06:46,477
Meng Er Da, over the past decades

41
00:06:46,522 --> 00:06:50,519
you refused to take down the boundary marker

42
00:06:50,593 --> 00:06:54,721
and instigated mutual hatred and gang fights

43
00:06:54,803 --> 00:07:00,010
l know exactly what you want!

44
00:07:00,057 --> 00:07:04,220
No, you don't! You're an old fool!

45
00:07:05,032 --> 00:07:06,040
Zhou Zhen Xian

46
00:07:06,111 --> 00:07:09,337
Don't judge me with your narrow mindedness

47
00:07:09,381 --> 00:07:11,254
Tell me...

48
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,591
The rules passed down from our ancestors

49
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:15,606
Should l change them?

50
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:18,798
lf you agree, l'll destroy our marker

51
00:07:18,845 --> 00:07:21,727
Then we'll never have to fight over them!

52
00:07:21,768 --> 00:07:23,879
What do you say?

53
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,107
We have yet to settle the matter at hand

54
00:07:26,186 --> 00:07:29,032
let alone predict the future!

55
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,248
Meng Er Da, l urge you to

56
00:07:30,327 --> 00:07:33,422
bury the hatchet and make peace

57
00:07:35,337 --> 00:07:39,608
Unless the Mengs take over this town

58
00:07:51,028 --> 00:07:53,080
Chief, let's set a fire

59
00:07:53,116 --> 00:07:54,254
to all the Zhous' properties

60
00:07:54,299 --> 00:07:57,145
lf you do that

61
00:07:57,187 --> 00:07:59,263
they'll burn yours too!

62
00:07:59,344 --> 00:08:01,325
He who strikes first will get the upper hand

63
00:08:01,536 --> 00:08:03,588
that's what you said, father!

64
00:08:03,658 --> 00:08:05,674
We can't just let this pass!

65
00:08:05,711 --> 00:08:06,742
That's right!

66
00:08:06,859 --> 00:08:09,741
l can promise you this...

67
00:08:09,782 --> 00:08:13,043
This town...

68
00:08:13,853 --> 00:08:17,222
will be ours in no time!

69
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,065
Yes!

70
00:08:19,106 --> 00:08:21,158
Remember

71
00:08:21,228 --> 00:08:24,454
don't do anything without my permission

72
00:08:25,543 --> 00:08:27,619
Meng Fa, follow me!

73
00:08:31,562 --> 00:08:33,850
Don't you feel bad that l'm hurt?

74
00:08:33,928 --> 00:08:35,766
Don't do this!

75
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,016
What's the situation?

76
00:08:37,095 --> 00:08:39,039
Will he come?

77
00:08:39,078 --> 00:08:42,268
No, he is too arrogant!

78
00:08:43,044 --> 00:08:44,253
He won't listen to my pleading

79
00:08:44,331 --> 00:08:47,213
and he doesn't buy flattery!

80
00:08:47,254 --> 00:08:48,428
None of the kung fu schools in Dama Bay

81
00:08:48,507 --> 00:08:53,513
gets along with him

82
00:08:53,551 --> 00:08:55,627
Men with true skills are like that

83
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:57,725
Versatile in all kinds of weapons

84
00:08:57,761 --> 00:09:01,022
especially the Shaolin rod

85
00:09:01,066 --> 00:09:03,877
l'd like to see that for myself!

86
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:06,066
lt won't be easy!

87
00:09:06,111 --> 00:09:08,328
Unless you're willing to

88
00:09:09,104 --> 00:09:10,349
seek him out personally

89
00:09:10,426 --> 00:09:13,415
And convince him to come help us

90
00:09:13,488 --> 00:09:16,583
He can teach our clansmen

91
00:09:16,619 --> 00:09:19,714
And can be very useful to us!

92
00:09:19,786 --> 00:09:23,890
We can kill 2 birds with 1 stone

93
00:09:23,926 --> 00:09:26,073
Let's do it!

94
00:09:26,848 --> 00:09:29,943
We'll leave tomorrow morning

95
00:09:33,215 --> 00:09:35,196
Always remember

96
00:09:35,233 --> 00:09:39,539
You must bear in mind during practice

97
00:09:39,582 --> 00:09:45,774
you're fighting a real enemy

98
00:09:45,811 --> 00:09:50,959
Copy a snake's writhe, a tiger's pose and hawk's eyes

99
00:09:50,994 --> 00:09:56,071
A deer's speed and a monkey's climb

100
00:09:56,109 --> 00:10:00,237
lt's about observing your opponent

101
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,431
Make good use of your limbs

102
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:05,465
Practice is the basics of kung fu

103
00:10:10,896 --> 00:10:14,893
Higher...more force!

104
00:10:20,116 --> 00:10:24,244
Master Ou, l wasn't expecting you

105
00:10:24,327 --> 00:10:26,509
With all these students

106
00:10:27,318 --> 00:10:29,606
you must be very busy!

107
00:10:29,684 --> 00:10:31,593
Please come inside!

108
00:10:31,633 --> 00:10:33,577
No!

109
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:42,164
We represent Dama Bay's

110
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:44,221
27 kung fu schools

111
00:10:44,297 --> 00:10:47,251
to ask you something

112
00:10:47,325 --> 00:10:50,385
Have l done something wrong?

113
00:10:50,422 --> 00:10:52,438
Very smart you are to solicit students

114
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:55,604
by promising to teach them everything

115
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,637
You flaunt your integrity

116
00:10:59,676 --> 00:11:03,910
And make a profit by taking in students

117
00:11:04,895 --> 00:11:07,042
l only know the duty of an instructor

118
00:11:07,087 --> 00:11:10,147
is to teach the students what l know

119
00:11:10,218 --> 00:11:13,278
without reservation

120
00:11:13,315 --> 00:11:17,586
This is the best way to propagate kung fu

121
00:11:17,664 --> 00:11:20,689
lf every instructor holds something back

122
00:11:20,726 --> 00:11:22,742
lt won't be long

123
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:24,795
before kung fu becomes extinct

124
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:26,811
You'd do well to remember that

125
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,910
it's the master's end if the student knows everything

126
00:11:29,946 --> 00:11:33,101
We must have a contingency plan

127
00:11:33,182 --> 00:11:37,310
Well, to each his own

128
00:11:37,392 --> 00:11:42,564
How l teach my students is not your concern!

129
00:11:51,865 --> 00:11:52,968
Catch, Master!

130
00:12:28,538 --> 00:12:29,569
Pardon me!

131
00:13:34,227 --> 00:13:35,258
Master Ou

132
00:13:35,305 --> 00:13:38,330
l choose to be selectively stubborn

133
00:14:20,119 --> 00:14:21,886
Stay back!

134
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:34,616
Stop!

135
00:14:34,697 --> 00:14:35,764
Stay back!

136
00:16:07,386 --> 00:16:08,394
Master Tan

137
00:16:08,429 --> 00:16:09,437
Master Meng

138
00:16:09,473 --> 00:16:10,444
What happened?

139
00:16:10,483 --> 00:16:13,543
Wang Yang has gone too far

140
00:16:20,851 --> 00:16:24,112
l bother no one if they leave me alone

141
00:16:24,156 --> 00:16:28,082
You've offended everyone in Dama Bay

142
00:16:28,157 --> 00:16:29,224
Master Ou

143
00:16:29,305 --> 00:16:32,330
l must correct you

144
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:35,557
lt's a master's honor if the student knows everything

145
00:16:35,602 --> 00:16:37,713
That's closer to the truth!

146
00:16:39,605 --> 00:16:40,636
Please go!

147
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:41,888
Let's go!

148
00:16:42,944 --> 00:16:44,782
Master Ou

149
00:16:46,945 --> 00:16:47,976
Master Wang

150
00:16:48,024 --> 00:16:49,127
l am impressed

151
00:16:49,172 --> 00:16:52,089
This is the Chief of the Meng clan

152
00:16:52,164 --> 00:16:53,302
He has always admired you

153
00:16:53,382 --> 00:16:56,477
We're here to pay you a visit

154
00:17:01,733 --> 00:17:04,722
Please accept it, Master Wang

155
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,907
''Civil and martial prowess''

156
00:17:08,899 --> 00:17:11,046
l don't deserve this

157
00:17:11,091 --> 00:17:11,956
But...

158
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,142
Please sit down

159
00:17:17,111 --> 00:17:18,391
Meng Fa

160
00:17:18,468 --> 00:17:22,501
l've already made myself clear last time

161
00:17:22,539 --> 00:17:25,564
You should not have bothered Chief Meng

162
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,711
But he...

163
00:17:27,758 --> 00:17:30,853
l must make this trip myself

164
00:17:30,889 --> 00:17:34,044
l can't bear to see our clansmen

165
00:17:34,856 --> 00:17:35,994
wait helplessly

166
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:38,992
for you to become their master

167
00:17:39,065 --> 00:17:41,117
lf l go with you

168
00:17:41,153 --> 00:17:45,221
my students here will be just as helpless!

169
00:17:46,337 --> 00:17:47,440
Our clansmen...

170
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,667
are all promising young men

171
00:17:49,712 --> 00:17:52,701
You should go see for yourself!

172
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:53,710
Yes...

173
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,834
That's not necessary

174
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,946
l welcome your clansmen

175
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:01,018
to come here and learn

176
00:18:01,089 --> 00:18:06,166
l've come a long way, Master Wang

177
00:18:06,204 --> 00:18:10,581
You shouldn't let me go back empty handed!

178
00:18:11,354 --> 00:18:12,492
l guarantee

179
00:18:12,536 --> 00:18:17,577
You'll feel differently when you meet them

180
00:18:17,651 --> 00:18:18,860
Please come with me

181
00:18:20,748 --> 00:18:20,984
l'm the instructor

182
00:18:21,756 --> 00:18:22,028
Of course!

183
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,947
l'm willing to teach anyone

184
00:18:25,027 --> 00:18:25,963
Yes!

185
00:18:26,001 --> 00:18:29,156
But l will not serve any clan exclusively

186
00:18:29,237 --> 00:18:30,340
Listen...

187
00:18:31,394 --> 00:18:33,303
Uncle

188
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,552
Let's go back to the inn

189
00:18:37,622 --> 00:18:41,584
and wait for Master Wang to change his mind!

190
00:18:41,658 --> 00:18:43,639
Very well!

191
00:18:43,676 --> 00:18:45,893
l'll take my leave now

192
00:18:45,938 --> 00:18:46,969
Goodbye!

193
00:18:47,991 --> 00:18:48,962
Let's go!

194
00:18:49,035 --> 00:18:52,130
Meng Fa, please take these with you

195
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,144
Don't be like this, Master Wang!

196
00:18:54,184 --> 00:18:56,260
Uncle! Let's go!

197
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:13,978
No, don't kill...

198
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:19,198
You can't do that, brother!

199
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:23,339
l'm not your brother, you shameless wench!

200
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:25,462
You've disgraced the family

201
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:28,592
How can l stay here in Dama Bay

202
00:19:28,663 --> 00:19:33,775
Tell me, how can l stay here!

203
00:19:33,813 --> 00:19:35,960
Please, brother, l beg you...

204
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:42,327
Come here, you bitch!

205
00:19:43,102 --> 00:19:45,390
Come out, Wang Yang!

206
00:19:45,468 --> 00:19:49,572
You impregnated my sister!

207
00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:52,669
You're a bastard!

208
00:19:56,915 --> 00:20:00,912
Friends, you're all blind

209
00:20:00,952 --> 00:20:03,028
to this beast

210
00:20:03,074 --> 00:20:05,018
You treated him like a god

211
00:20:05,092 --> 00:20:08,187
and respected him

212
00:20:08,223 --> 00:20:12,351
Only one of us will come out alive!

213
00:20:12,434 --> 00:20:13,501
Come here!

214
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:14,577
Don't hit my brother!

215
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,560
Come here!

216
00:20:15,634 --> 00:20:17,710
Wang Yang, don't hit him!

217
00:20:17,757 --> 00:20:18,657
Let go!

218
00:20:18,696 --> 00:20:22,895
What shall we do?

219
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,051
Master Wang, you're at fault

220
00:20:25,863 --> 00:20:27,037
You impregnated her

221
00:20:27,081 --> 00:20:29,998
And beat up her brother

222
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:32,255
How can you do such a thing?

223
00:20:32,334 --> 00:20:34,243
There must be some mistake

224
00:20:34,283 --> 00:20:39,431
Appearances are so deceiving

225
00:20:39,502 --> 00:20:42,527
Friends and neighbors

226
00:20:42,598 --> 00:20:44,886
l'm not that kind of a man

227
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,843
All these years

228
00:20:47,922 --> 00:20:51,041
l have abided by the law

229
00:20:51,123 --> 00:20:54,077
l don't know why they want to frame me

230
00:20:54,115 --> 00:20:56,262
and tarnish my name!

231
00:20:56,307 --> 00:20:57,338
Wang Yang!

232
00:20:57,421 --> 00:20:59,437
l don't even know them

233
00:20:59,473 --> 00:21:01,489
You don't know her?

234
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:04,408
Tell me

235
00:21:04,483 --> 00:21:05,728
When you got her in bed

236
00:21:06,537 --> 00:21:08,684
did you know her?

237
00:21:08,728 --> 00:21:12,832
l'm not afraid of you

238
00:21:12,868 --> 00:21:15,015
l dare you to kill me

239
00:21:15,095 --> 00:21:16,933
and silence me

240
00:21:16,974 --> 00:21:19,191
Or l'll fight you to the bitter end

241
00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:27,505
l'll fight you!

242
00:21:30,508 --> 00:21:31,788
l'll fight you!

243
00:21:33,744 --> 00:21:35,725
You can't do that!

244
00:21:35,763 --> 00:21:36,866
Let go!

245
00:21:37,815 --> 00:21:39,024
l'll fight you!

246
00:21:52,568 --> 00:21:55,687
Blood...

247
00:21:55,769 --> 00:21:59,695
Murder...

248
00:21:59,734 --> 00:22:00,908
Brother...

249
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:05,151
He killed him!

250
00:22:05,963 --> 00:22:09,189
Arrest him!

251
00:22:09,233 --> 00:22:15,448
Arrest him!

252
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:43,740
You raped his sister

253
00:22:43,783 --> 00:22:46,772
Now you killed him! You're in trouble!

254
00:22:46,809 --> 00:22:48,790
Take me to the district office

255
00:22:48,862 --> 00:22:49,798
Don't bother

256
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:52,896
He'll be dead just the same! Kill him now!

257
00:23:11,826 --> 00:23:15,016
Here come the officers!

258
00:23:17,045 --> 00:23:18,016
What's the matter?

259
00:23:18,054 --> 00:23:19,998
Wang Yang killed this man

260
00:23:20,038 --> 00:23:21,247
Wang Yang killed him

261
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,458
Stand back!

262
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,518
Where is Wang Yang?

263
00:23:31,554 --> 00:23:32,585
He's not here!

264
00:23:32,632 --> 00:23:36,665
Search the premises!

265
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:45,287
You can't go back now!

266
00:23:49,368 --> 00:23:51,277
Master Wang

267
00:23:54,656 --> 00:23:56,708
lt's one thing to cause disturbance

268
00:23:57,509 --> 00:23:59,620
but you killed someone!

269
00:23:59,702 --> 00:24:01,813
You must leave here at once

270
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:02,996
l will not run away

271
00:24:03,807 --> 00:24:06,095
and be a fugitive for the rest of my life

272
00:24:06,137 --> 00:24:08,118
l'll turn myself in!

273
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:11,181
That's suicide!

274
00:24:11,252 --> 00:24:13,196
They're ganging up on you

275
00:24:13,235 --> 00:24:14,338
My uncle realized this

276
00:24:14,383 --> 00:24:16,364
and told me to wait for you here

277
00:24:16,402 --> 00:24:17,505
What should l...

278
00:24:17,585 --> 00:24:18,616
Alright...

279
00:24:18,698 --> 00:24:21,580
My uncle has friends in high places

280
00:24:21,621 --> 00:24:22,592
But...

281
00:24:22,665 --> 00:24:23,874
He'll take care of it

282
00:24:24,647 --> 00:24:28,016
Maybe they'll close the case

283
00:24:33,276 --> 00:24:37,238
Brilliant plan!

284
00:24:37,312 --> 00:24:40,301
Thanks for your hard work

285
00:24:40,374 --> 00:24:43,469
Such a great performance!

286
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:49,663
You must leave at once

287
00:24:49,734 --> 00:24:51,845
You're supposed to be dead

288
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:56,090
l'll leave when l get the money!

289
00:24:58,293 --> 00:25:01,104
Thanks for all your help!

290
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,425
Don't mention it!

291
00:25:03,233 --> 00:25:06,388
You scratch my back, l'll scratch yours!

292
00:25:06,434 --> 00:25:09,494
We want the same thing

293
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:10,597
That's why...

294
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:13,739
once Wang Yang leaves Dama Bay

295
00:25:13,775 --> 00:25:19,054
Master Ou will profit from taking in students

296
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:21,176
Yes!

297
00:25:34,755 --> 00:25:37,910
Your seat is up ahead, Master Wang!

298
00:25:38,688 --> 00:25:40,976
Sit down, don't be shy!

299
00:25:42,827 --> 00:25:44,938
What are you doing?

300
00:25:45,229 --> 00:25:49,357
Master Wang is our guest

301
00:25:50,134 --> 00:25:51,343
lt took us great trouble to get him here!

302
00:25:51,387 --> 00:25:56,428
What's the meaning of this?

303
00:25:56,501 --> 00:25:59,526
This is ridiculous!

304
00:25:59,668 --> 00:26:02,693
Please forgive them!

305
00:26:02,764 --> 00:26:04,780
You...

306
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:13,669
You certainly deserve your reputation

307
00:27:13,707 --> 00:27:15,854
Great skills!

308
00:27:17,743 --> 00:27:21,906
You've passed the celestial chair

309
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,419
Please come down

310
00:27:53,232 --> 00:27:55,520
Your turn...

311
00:28:14,281 --> 00:28:16,428
Master Meng, l'm leaving!

312
00:28:17,204 --> 00:28:18,413
Wait!

313
00:28:18,456 --> 00:28:21,551
l know they have insulted you

314
00:28:21,623 --> 00:28:24,612
That's nothing! The important thing

315
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:27,639
is that we must have virtues

316
00:28:27,677 --> 00:28:28,922
Your clansmen harbor evil intentions

317
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,782
l'm afraid once they learn kung fu

318
00:28:31,817 --> 00:28:35,007
they'll bully others

319
00:28:35,053 --> 00:28:39,050
l don't want students like this

320
00:28:39,124 --> 00:28:41,377
lt's my fault that l haven't been strict with them

321
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:46,532
Meng Feng, kneel down...

322
00:28:46,604 --> 00:28:48,477
All of you, kneel!

323
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,526
Kneel!

324
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:51,850
This is your instructor

325
00:28:53,807 --> 00:28:56,962
You see, they never had a proper teacher

326
00:28:57,042 --> 00:28:59,094
and know nothing about virtues

327
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:02,047
honoring the teacher or respecting the truth

328
00:29:02,123 --> 00:29:06,227
l'll count on you from now on

329
00:29:06,298 --> 00:29:10,569
Please stay, for my sake!

330
00:29:10,612 --> 00:29:15,784
Yes, please stay!

331
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,668
Get up!

332
00:29:18,996 --> 00:29:21,048
Zhou Ping, you're quite something!

333
00:29:21,989 --> 00:29:23,933
l've finished bathing

334
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:26,154
and you're still standing there!

335
00:29:26,234 --> 00:29:28,107
The guy at the temple

336
00:29:28,147 --> 00:29:30,199
once told me

337
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,416
strong legs is the key to kung fu

338
00:29:32,461 --> 00:29:34,608
l must practice my stance

339
00:29:35,593 --> 00:29:36,696
More water!

340
00:29:58,522 --> 00:30:01,511
Zhou Ping, come here!

341
00:30:21,311 --> 00:30:23,599
This is not the proper way to practice

342
00:30:24,408 --> 00:30:26,661
You need a proper instructor

343
00:30:26,738 --> 00:30:29,620
You're just wasting your time

344
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,737
l...

345
00:30:40,308 --> 00:30:43,262
Magnificent!

346
00:30:43,335 --> 00:30:45,351
Lure the opponent by retreating

347
00:30:45,388 --> 00:30:46,396
What?

348
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:47,470
Parthian shot

349
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:49,418
Parthian shot?

350
00:31:01,183 --> 00:31:06,189
Careful, Meng Feng!

351
00:31:07,203 --> 00:31:09,219
Watch closely!

352
00:31:23,034 --> 00:31:26,189
This is strange...

353
00:31:26,965 --> 00:31:31,093
he stops here every time

354
00:31:31,175 --> 00:31:32,349
Why?

355
00:31:32,393 --> 00:31:35,488
Maybe that's all to it

356
00:31:35,524 --> 00:31:37,468
No!

357
00:31:47,981 --> 00:31:50,970
You said you're not from the Meng clan

358
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:55,110
and that you have no relatives?

359
00:31:56,296 --> 00:32:00,400
l'm an orphan. Jia Jia is the name...

360
00:32:00,437 --> 00:32:02,619
given to me by the Chief

361
00:32:04,646 --> 00:32:07,765
Why are you here?

362
00:32:07,813 --> 00:32:11,775
To tell you something

363
00:32:11,814 --> 00:32:14,139
lt's not easy being the instructor

364
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,267
You may not have the patience

365
00:32:18,215 --> 00:32:21,334
Thanks! You're saying...

366
00:32:21,417 --> 00:32:24,512
l should leave here?

367
00:32:24,548 --> 00:32:25,615
You're thinking too much!

368
00:32:26,392 --> 00:32:28,468
You've been hired by Chief Meng

369
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:30,601
you must be a very good instructor

370
00:32:30,671 --> 00:32:34,905
You can handle the job

371
00:32:37,108 --> 00:32:41,070
lf l were a boy

372
00:32:41,109 --> 00:32:45,308
l can learn from you

373
00:32:50,573 --> 00:32:53,763
You have something on your mind?

374
00:32:55,722 --> 00:32:57,738
No!

375
00:33:06,195 --> 00:33:09,350
l'm leaving!

376
00:33:09,431 --> 00:33:13,499
Tell Jia Jia not to come here again!

377
00:33:13,536 --> 00:33:14,567
Yes!

378
00:33:25,992 --> 00:33:27,936
Don't be afraid

379
00:33:29,123 --> 00:33:32,148
We grew up together

380
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,314
What were you doing at the drill ground?

381
00:33:35,352 --> 00:33:36,490
Before Wang Yang arrived

382
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:38,622
you never went there

383
00:33:41,684 --> 00:33:43,557
You've to remember

384
00:33:43,598 --> 00:33:46,693
who's paying for your food and clothing!

385
00:33:46,764 --> 00:33:50,963
l won't forget Chief Meng raised me

386
00:33:51,009 --> 00:33:55,042
and that l've always been bullied by you

387
00:33:55,323 --> 00:34:00,258
You'll be my wife soon

388
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:04,604
l'm warning you! Don't go near Wang Yang again!

389
00:34:04,648 --> 00:34:06,795
Or l'll show you!

390
00:34:20,096 --> 00:34:22,148
Master, there are fun places over there

391
00:34:22,218 --> 00:34:23,249
Yes!

392
00:34:23,296 --> 00:34:25,407
We should go back

393
00:34:25,454 --> 00:34:28,336
Yes...

394
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,599
Come here!

395
00:34:34,674 --> 00:34:35,883
Call him

396
00:34:35,926 --> 00:34:37,870
Master Wang!

397
00:34:38,953 --> 00:34:41,064
Call him what?

398
00:34:41,111 --> 00:34:43,055
Master Wang!

399
00:34:48,243 --> 00:34:49,310
Did you call me?

400
00:34:49,391 --> 00:34:51,443
Master Wang, my name is Zhou Ping

401
00:34:51,479 --> 00:34:54,433
l'm a waiter at Zhou's Restaurant over there

402
00:34:54,506 --> 00:34:56,688
Noodles is our specialty

403
00:34:56,733 --> 00:34:58,809
Would you like to try?

404
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:03,930
Maybe next time...let's go!

405
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:04,941
Come on!

406
00:35:05,013 --> 00:35:06,187
Master Wang

407
00:35:10,163 --> 00:35:11,408
What's this?

408
00:35:12,181 --> 00:35:14,506
A custom to hack-off limbs that cross the boundary

409
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:16,455
Who set the rule?

410
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:18,546
My father...

411
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:19,650
but not recently!

412
00:35:19,731 --> 00:35:21,842
lt was set down a long time ago

413
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:25,774
Did you agree to this?

414
00:35:25,855 --> 00:35:26,791
No!

415
00:35:26,829 --> 00:35:27,967
Master Wang!

416
00:35:32,186 --> 00:35:33,217
Master Wang!

417
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,200
Yes?

418
00:35:34,274 --> 00:35:37,263
Chief Zhou never agreed to this

419
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,448
Whoever took the wrong step

420
00:35:39,528 --> 00:35:42,517
was dragged over and had their limbs cut off

421
00:35:42,556 --> 00:35:45,581
This is both brutal and unreasonable

422
00:35:45,651 --> 00:35:46,825
isn't it?

423
00:35:46,869 --> 00:35:51,032
But that's the rule!

424
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:52,841
Alright!

425
00:35:52,889 --> 00:35:55,000
Master, you're our instructor

426
00:35:55,081 --> 00:35:56,089
how can you speak for them?

427
00:35:56,159 --> 00:36:00,192
l'm an instructor, but not just for your clan

428
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:04,393
Besides, l hate bullies

429
00:36:04,475 --> 00:36:05,649
Let's go!

430
00:36:09,728 --> 00:36:12,717
Don't get involved with the Mengs again

431
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:13,928
they're beasts!

432
00:36:17,035 --> 00:36:18,908
Come up...

433
00:36:21,002 --> 00:36:22,105
Stand firm!

434
00:36:28,308 --> 00:36:29,588
Slowly!

435
00:36:34,779 --> 00:36:36,617
You two get up there!

436
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,031
Turn!

437
00:36:41,947 --> 00:36:43,121
Faster!

438
00:36:45,287 --> 00:36:48,204
More strength

439
00:36:48,383 --> 00:36:50,256
Crouch down!

440
00:36:52,558 --> 00:36:54,539
This is no way to learn the rod

441
00:36:54,577 --> 00:36:56,450
This is suicide!

442
00:36:56,491 --> 00:36:57,700
What is this?

443
00:36:59,622 --> 00:37:02,883
We'll kill ourselves before we learn the rod

444
00:37:02,962 --> 00:37:05,014
What did you say? Come here!

445
00:37:06,928 --> 00:37:08,102
l said ''what is this''?

446
00:37:08,146 --> 00:37:11,100
Repeat that line until dark. Do it now!

447
00:37:11,173 --> 00:37:12,144
Come on

448
00:37:12,182 --> 00:37:14,329
What is this?

449
00:37:14,374 --> 00:37:15,239
Louder

450
00:37:15,313 --> 00:37:17,460
What is this?

451
00:37:17,505 --> 00:37:19,486
lf you want to learn to use the rod well

452
00:37:19,558 --> 00:37:23,686
this wheel is crucial in training your waist

453
00:37:23,733 --> 00:37:26,687
The rod is the first long weapon

454
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,021
You circle, point, hit and sweep

455
00:37:30,066 --> 00:37:31,975
You'll fail if your legs are weak

456
00:37:32,014 --> 00:37:36,047
You'll never perfect the hit and sweep technique

457
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:39,214
Meng Feng! Your turn!

458
00:37:42,522 --> 00:37:43,589
Turn!

459
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:46,521
Slowly!

460
00:37:46,557 --> 00:37:47,624
Try harder!

461
00:38:09,626 --> 00:38:11,678
Zhou Ping!

462
00:38:11,713 --> 00:38:12,613
Boss!

463
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:13,695
You're still up?

464
00:38:13,765 --> 00:38:15,947
How can l sleep with this racket?

465
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,096
You took that apart?

466
00:38:20,168 --> 00:38:22,041
What are you doing?

467
00:38:22,081 --> 00:38:23,184
Look!

468
00:38:26,152 --> 00:38:28,477
What do you think?

469
00:38:29,284 --> 00:38:30,292
What is this for?

470
00:38:30,327 --> 00:38:32,544
This is how Master Wang taught the rod

471
00:38:32,624 --> 00:38:36,728
l heard this gadget is for...

472
00:38:36,764 --> 00:38:38,911
practicing the stance

473
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:41,866
All those Mengs...

474
00:38:41,913 --> 00:38:43,016
are nothing but idiots

475
00:38:43,061 --> 00:38:46,987
They all fell down and bruised themselves

476
00:38:47,062 --> 00:38:50,252
lt was such ajoy to see them like that

477
00:38:50,334 --> 00:38:52,386
Don't go there anymore

478
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:55,372
You'll get into trouble

479
00:38:55,413 --> 00:38:57,429
Don't worry, l'll be careful

480
00:38:57,466 --> 00:38:58,711
They won't find out

481
00:38:59,518 --> 00:39:01,665
Let me show you!

482
00:39:01,745 --> 00:39:02,776
Show me what?

483
00:39:02,824 --> 00:39:05,778
Come, Fatty! Give me a hand!

484
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:12,242
Faster!

485
00:39:12,322 --> 00:39:14,231
You'll kill yourself!

486
00:39:14,271 --> 00:39:16,215
Watch this!

487
00:39:16,254 --> 00:39:17,321
Faster!

488
00:39:21,438 --> 00:39:23,620
Faster!

489
00:39:23,699 --> 00:39:25,572
ls this alright?

490
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,938
Yes, faster!

491
00:39:28,954 --> 00:39:31,979
ls it fast enough?

492
00:39:32,015 --> 00:39:33,924
Stay back...

493
00:40:06,356 --> 00:40:08,538
Look at the notice!

494
00:40:20,865 --> 00:40:22,074
For me?

495
00:40:53,153 --> 00:40:55,300
Father, Uncle Sha is here!

496
00:40:56,493 --> 00:40:59,410
l was worried something happened to you!

497
00:40:59,485 --> 00:41:01,561
Father was afraid you won't make it!

498
00:41:01,642 --> 00:41:03,623
l know what's going on

499
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,712
Nothing will happen to me!

500
00:41:05,782 --> 00:41:08,972
Please have a seat!

501
00:41:09,052 --> 00:41:10,925
Yes!

502
00:41:11,941 --> 00:41:15,131
l'm a wanted man

503
00:41:15,211 --> 00:41:20,288
l must lay low for a while

504
00:41:20,326 --> 00:41:21,429
Will you blame me for your losses?

505
00:41:21,509 --> 00:41:25,506
l only worry about your safety

506
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:28,806
Stay here and let us know if you need anything

507
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:32,005
Keep a low profile

508
00:41:32,051 --> 00:41:35,040
Times are different now

509
00:41:35,113 --> 00:41:37,995
l'm not afraid of anyone!

510
00:41:38,036 --> 00:41:41,262
Wang Yang from Dama Bay

511
00:41:41,341 --> 00:41:43,417
is now our kung fu instructor

512
00:41:44,437 --> 00:41:46,548
Him?

513
00:42:02,077 --> 00:42:07,356
Your punch carries 30% strength, your kick 70%

514
00:42:07,436 --> 00:42:10,425
Watch your waist and stance

515
00:42:10,463 --> 00:42:13,653
Alright! Start from the beginning!

516
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:15,501
Yes!

517
00:42:26,189 --> 00:42:28,027
Watch out!

518
00:42:28,068 --> 00:42:31,401
They've been practicing indoors

519
00:42:31,478 --> 00:42:33,351
and have become lazy

520
00:42:33,391 --> 00:42:34,565
Once they go outdoors

521
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,665
see how energetic they are!

522
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,711
Honestly...

523
00:42:39,758 --> 00:42:42,818
When they urged me to speak to you last night

524
00:42:42,855 --> 00:42:45,974
l was afraid you'd object

525
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:50,009
l'm open to good ideas

526
00:42:59,347 --> 00:43:00,556
Excuse me...

527
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:07,835
Who is it?

528
00:43:19,353 --> 00:43:21,464
That'll teach him a lesson!

529
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:38,102
Are you alright?

530
00:43:38,176 --> 00:43:40,157
Do you know who that is?

531
00:43:40,194 --> 00:43:42,246
Are you alright?

532
00:43:42,281 --> 00:43:43,181
Are you badly hurt?

533
00:43:43,221 --> 00:43:44,359
Master!

534
00:43:46,422 --> 00:43:48,604
The wound is too minor

535
00:43:49,379 --> 00:43:52,498
You could have killed him if you stab him again!

536
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,632
That won't do

537
00:43:54,668 --> 00:43:55,806
l can't kill him in one strike

538
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:58,945
lf l engage him any longer, he'll know who l am

539
00:43:59,017 --> 00:44:01,069
That won't do us any good!

540
00:44:07,158 --> 00:44:08,367
What is it?

541
00:44:08,446 --> 00:44:10,355
Jia Jia is here again!

542
00:44:10,394 --> 00:44:12,375
She's always with him

543
00:44:12,412 --> 00:44:14,393
How can that be?

544
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:16,755
You must make up your mind

545
00:44:21,702 --> 00:44:23,017
l brought you some tonic

546
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:24,999
Have it while it's still hot

547
00:44:28,174 --> 00:44:32,136
l've figured it out

548
00:44:32,209 --> 00:44:35,328
The assassin attacked me with a sickle

549
00:44:35,376 --> 00:44:39,610
Judging from his skill, he should use a soft weapon

550
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:42,679
And not a hooked weapon

551
00:44:42,856 --> 00:44:45,810
He almost pierced through your heart

552
00:44:45,848 --> 00:44:48,943
Who cares what he used ?!

553
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:53,143
To know your opponent is a sure way to win

554
00:44:53,189 --> 00:44:54,292
How can l not think?

555
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:58,187
Can't you think...

556
00:44:58,269 --> 00:45:00,380
or talk about something else?

557
00:45:00,427 --> 00:45:04,460
Other than martial arts, there's...

558
00:45:04,532 --> 00:45:07,592
really nothing worth thinking

559
00:45:07,629 --> 00:45:11,935
You need not think of anything else

560
00:45:13,057 --> 00:45:16,152
Chief Meng told me

561
00:45:16,188 --> 00:45:19,307
the Zhous have sent the assassin

562
00:45:19,354 --> 00:45:21,227
Do you think so?

563
00:45:21,303 --> 00:45:24,529
No. lf you say the Mengs did this

564
00:45:24,573 --> 00:45:27,419
l'd believe it

565
00:45:27,461 --> 00:45:29,477
What?

566
00:45:29,617 --> 00:45:31,561
Don't ask me anymore

567
00:45:31,636 --> 00:45:33,783
Finish this, l have to go!

568
00:46:59,245 --> 00:47:00,216
Someone's watching!

569
00:47:00,254 --> 00:47:01,499
Meng Fa, bring him in here!

570
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:05,710
Bring him in...beat him!

571
00:47:11,875 --> 00:47:13,927
That's enough!

572
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,013
He spied on us!

573
00:47:16,084 --> 00:47:17,115
Beat him up!

574
00:47:17,163 --> 00:47:19,072
Stop!

575
00:47:20,086 --> 00:47:23,419
lf you want to learn

576
00:47:24,192 --> 00:47:25,472
You should come to me

577
00:47:25,514 --> 00:47:27,352
instead of spying

578
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:28,636
l have wanted to tell you

579
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:30,584
but l never had the chance

580
00:47:30,663 --> 00:47:31,694
because you live here...

581
00:47:31,776 --> 00:47:33,828
Alright! Let him go!

582
00:47:33,864 --> 00:47:35,808
Not so fast!

583
00:47:38,839 --> 00:47:39,870
l'm outnumbered

584
00:47:39,953 --> 00:47:41,056
l dare you to take me on one by one

585
00:47:41,101 --> 00:47:42,939
Very well!

586
00:47:43,188 --> 00:47:46,213
l'd like to see how much you have learned

587
00:47:49,347 --> 00:47:50,521
Catch!

588
00:47:52,582 --> 00:47:54,658
Stand back!

589
00:48:09,109 --> 00:48:11,291
Come on!

590
00:48:11,371 --> 00:48:13,352
Good!

591
00:48:32,212 --> 00:48:34,050
Let me...

592
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:18,096
Stop! Step down!

593
00:49:19,948 --> 00:49:22,059
Zhou Ping, come with me!

594
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:23,111
No!

595
00:49:23,148 --> 00:49:25,259
You can't leave!

596
00:49:25,306 --> 00:49:27,358
What's this?

597
00:49:27,429 --> 00:49:29,302
Listen...don't let him leave!

598
00:49:29,377 --> 00:49:30,444
Stand back!

599
00:49:30,594 --> 00:49:33,619
lf you go, don't blame me

600
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:52,299
Father, that bastard Zhou Ping

601
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:53,549
spied on us at the drill ground

602
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:55,425
We caught him!

603
00:49:55,471 --> 00:49:58,566
But Master Wang wants to escort him out

604
00:49:58,637 --> 00:50:01,898
How dare you, Zhou Ping!

605
00:50:01,943 --> 00:50:06,878
You crossed the boundary and came here

606
00:50:06,919 --> 00:50:11,082
You're in big trouble now!

607
00:50:11,163 --> 00:50:16,335
Master Wang, you know about our family feud

608
00:50:16,417 --> 00:50:21,529
lt's not easy to mediate

609
00:50:21,566 --> 00:50:24,661
Your feud is not my concern

610
00:50:24,697 --> 00:50:26,749
l'm a kung fu instructor

611
00:50:26,819 --> 00:50:28,763
l can choose my students

612
00:50:28,838 --> 00:50:31,091
Yes, but not him

613
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:34,047
Because he's a Zhou

614
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:39,170
l have no bias

615
00:50:39,206 --> 00:50:40,309
No matter what you say

616
00:50:40,389 --> 00:50:43,449
This kid is staying

617
00:50:43,486 --> 00:50:44,624
Stay here

618
00:50:44,704 --> 00:50:46,542
so that you can hack off

619
00:50:46,583 --> 00:50:48,635
his arms and legs?

620
00:50:48,705 --> 00:50:50,757
There's no need to quarrel

621
00:50:50,792 --> 00:50:51,763
Whatever is the matter

622
00:50:51,836 --> 00:50:52,974
do not hurt our relationship

623
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:54,028
Shut up!

624
00:50:54,063 --> 00:50:57,123
l always knew Chief Meng is a kung fu expert

625
00:50:57,195 --> 00:50:59,176
You need not show mercy

626
00:50:59,247 --> 00:51:01,323
lf l can't take him with me today

627
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:04,216
l only have myself to blame

628
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:16,742
Don't quibble over such small matters

629
00:51:16,783 --> 00:51:21,955
You'll upset the bigger plan. You must reconsider

630
00:51:25,272 --> 00:51:26,280
Stop!

631
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:28,392
Stop!

632
00:51:30,422 --> 00:51:33,541
Zhou Ping, it's your lucky day today!

633
00:51:33,622 --> 00:51:36,777
Otherwise l'd have skinned you alive!

634
00:51:37,693 --> 00:51:39,804
Master Wang

635
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:43,812
The chief wishes to make peace

636
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:48,050
You may go now!

637
00:52:10,956 --> 00:52:12,023
He can't leave!

638
00:52:12,104 --> 00:52:13,278
Zhou Ping

639
00:52:19,445 --> 00:52:22,635
Come here!

640
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,553
Zhou Ping!

641
00:52:26,821 --> 00:52:28,932
What's the big deal?

642
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:34,162
This is Master Wang!

643
00:52:34,997 --> 00:52:37,013
Sir, Master Wang!

644
00:52:37,085 --> 00:52:38,259
Master Wang!

645
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:43,336
Master Wang!

646
00:52:43,417 --> 00:52:46,572
Boss, l've invited Master Wang here

647
00:52:47,523 --> 00:52:49,670
How are you?

648
00:52:50,758 --> 00:52:51,896
Fatty, Master Wang is here!

649
00:52:52,673 --> 00:52:53,811
Really?

650
00:52:53,890 --> 00:52:56,001
Zhou Ping, you know we're busy

651
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:59,001
Where have you been?

652
00:53:05,163 --> 00:53:06,408
Master Wang

653
00:53:07,286 --> 00:53:08,294
Please be seated

654
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:09,433
Yes!

655
00:53:09,512 --> 00:53:10,615
lmpressive!

656
00:53:10,695 --> 00:53:12,747
Get out!

657
00:53:13,513 --> 00:53:14,793
Bring some tea

658
00:53:27,257 --> 00:53:28,324
Please!

659
00:53:30,284 --> 00:53:32,336
Master Wang!

660
00:53:32,406 --> 00:53:33,580
l went to the Mengs

661
00:53:33,624 --> 00:53:35,676
and invited Master Wang to try your noodles

662
00:53:36,442 --> 00:53:38,589
Nonsense! How many lives do you have?

663
00:53:39,678 --> 00:53:41,659
Just one!

664
00:53:42,775 --> 00:53:43,746
Please sit down!

665
00:53:43,783 --> 00:53:45,930
No thanks!

666
00:53:47,054 --> 00:53:51,182
He's addicted to martial arts

667
00:53:51,229 --> 00:53:55,297
especially about your skill

668
00:53:56,309 --> 00:53:57,317
Yes!

669
00:53:57,352 --> 00:54:00,471
He goes to watch you whenever he has time

670
00:54:00,554 --> 00:54:01,657
Really?

671
00:54:01,702 --> 00:54:04,797
He made many gadgets for practice

672
00:54:04,833 --> 00:54:06,706
They're all in the backyard

673
00:54:06,782 --> 00:54:07,885
This way...

674
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:12,968
Right here!

675
00:54:13,114 --> 00:54:14,217
l watched how you teach them

676
00:54:14,262 --> 00:54:16,171
and l do the same when l come back

677
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:19,235
But l've made no progress

678
00:54:22,473 --> 00:54:27,621
You've shown respect for martial arts

679
00:54:27,692 --> 00:54:31,796
l'll take you in as my student

680
00:54:31,833 --> 00:54:37,953
Master...

681
00:54:38,026 --> 00:54:39,093
Boss

682
00:54:39,139 --> 00:54:41,286
Be a good student

683
00:54:41,331 --> 00:54:44,248
Master Wang, l must attend to business

684
00:54:44,289 --> 00:54:45,463
Please

685
00:54:52,847 --> 00:54:53,855
No!

686
00:54:53,891 --> 00:54:54,827
Will you regret it?

687
00:54:54,901 --> 00:54:56,882
Never!

688
00:54:57,822 --> 00:55:00,004
l've tried that and l fell down hard!

689
00:55:00,084 --> 00:55:01,187
Get on!

690
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:05,154
Let go!

691
00:55:28,128 --> 00:55:30,381
Where are you, Master?

692
00:56:01,389 --> 00:56:03,749
Zhou Ping's noodles are famous around here

693
00:56:04,765 --> 00:56:05,701
Master Wang

694
00:56:05,739 --> 00:56:08,799
He even dreams about learning from you

695
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:10,922
He's totally enchanted

696
00:56:10,958 --> 00:56:13,010
How are the noodles, Master?

697
00:56:13,045 --> 00:56:13,945
Not bad!

698
00:56:14,193 --> 00:56:16,137
Come on!

699
00:56:33,991 --> 00:56:35,829
What is it?

700
00:56:44,325 --> 00:56:46,377
My melon!

701
00:56:53,614 --> 00:56:55,630
Pay for my melon

702
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:03,032
l need to talk to Master Wang

703
00:57:05,165 --> 00:57:07,217
Forget it, let him go!

704
00:57:07,288 --> 00:57:08,259
Thanks!

705
00:57:08,296 --> 00:57:09,363
Get lost!

706
00:57:11,497 --> 00:57:12,528
Meng Fa!

707
00:57:12,577 --> 00:57:14,558
Meng Fa!

708
00:57:14,629 --> 00:57:16,645
l need to talk to Master Wang

709
00:57:16,716 --> 00:57:18,732
What do you want?

710
00:57:18,874 --> 00:57:20,926
What do you want? Get out!

711
00:57:23,919 --> 00:57:25,093
l'm looking for Master Wang

712
00:57:25,868 --> 00:57:26,935
Master Wang

713
00:57:33,313 --> 00:57:35,294
Zhou Ping

714
00:57:39,645 --> 00:57:41,721
My name is Fatty

715
00:57:42,533 --> 00:57:43,707
Hello!

716
00:57:44,725 --> 00:57:45,899
Master Wang

717
00:57:47,822 --> 00:57:48,830
Master Wang

718
00:57:48,865 --> 00:57:51,118
How dare you cross the boundary!

719
00:57:51,197 --> 00:57:54,043
You're not afraid of

720
00:57:54,084 --> 00:57:56,100
having your limbs chopped off?

721
00:57:56,172 --> 00:57:58,224
Of course l am!

722
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:00,407
l need to speak to you

723
00:58:00,486 --> 00:58:03,475
l'll take my chances

724
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:09,773
Chief Meng heard that you want to teach Zhou Ping

725
00:58:09,811 --> 00:58:12,871
He has no right to meddle

726
00:58:12,942 --> 00:58:17,046
But he still wants you to live with us

727
00:58:17,082 --> 00:58:22,289
lt'll be more convenient

728
00:58:22,337 --> 00:58:25,563
lf Chief Meng cares about his clansmen

729
00:58:26,372 --> 00:58:27,475
l'll consider his offer

730
00:58:35,766 --> 00:58:38,054
What's the meaning of this?

731
00:58:38,863 --> 00:58:43,134
l have orders from the Chief

732
00:58:44,325 --> 00:58:47,385
Master Wang, this is a mere token

733
00:58:47,422 --> 00:58:51,526
of our sincerity, please accept it!

734
00:58:51,563 --> 00:58:56,604
We'd like to discuss matters peacefully

735
00:58:56,677 --> 00:58:58,930
Please go ahead

736
00:58:59,739 --> 00:59:03,108
l know you don't want to stay here

737
00:59:03,149 --> 00:59:06,066
As long as you agree to teach them

738
00:59:06,106 --> 00:59:09,095
the Shaolin rod

739
00:59:09,133 --> 00:59:12,431
The price is on the table

740
00:59:14,595 --> 00:59:16,611
Price?

741
00:59:16,648 --> 00:59:18,759
lf you'll agree

742
00:59:19,535 --> 00:59:23,806
Sorry! l've taught them enough

743
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:25,926
but they're not worthy of the Shaolin rod

744
00:59:26,008 --> 00:59:31,085
Don't forget you're still a wanted criminal

745
00:59:31,123 --> 00:59:34,242
The murder case is not yet closed

746
00:59:34,288 --> 00:59:36,364
l dare not say l've done you a favor

747
00:59:36,446 --> 00:59:39,565
But l helped you out of a fix

748
00:59:39,646 --> 00:59:44,687
How can you be so ungrateful?

749
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:47,812
l'm guilty of manslaughter

750
00:59:47,858 --> 00:59:48,925
But did you really save me

751
00:59:48,971 --> 00:59:50,880
or was it part of your trap?

752
00:59:50,955 --> 00:59:52,022
You...

753
00:59:52,067 --> 00:59:54,119
Chief Meng, will you

754
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:58,080
swear in front of this plaque

755
00:59:58,156 --> 01:00:00,232
that it wasn't a trap?

756
01:00:00,487 --> 01:00:04,484
lf l could find a better place to stay

757
01:00:04,524 --> 01:00:07,549
l would never have troubled you

758
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:10,680
What l have seen and heard these 6 months

759
01:00:10,717 --> 01:00:11,891
is enough to prove

760
01:00:11,969 --> 01:00:14,994
how extraordinary the Meng clan is

761
01:00:15,031 --> 01:00:18,993
What do you mean?

762
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:21,214
l'm afraid you can't leave!

763
01:00:21,293 --> 01:00:25,361
You can come in but you can't go out!

764
01:00:26,269 --> 01:00:28,451
You're welcome to try if you don't believe me

765
01:00:31,488 --> 01:00:34,583
Listen, Uncle!

766
01:00:34,654 --> 01:00:37,773
Why do this?

767
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:41,010
lf Master Wang wants to leave, you can't force him

768
01:00:41,056 --> 01:00:44,045
Let's part as friends

769
01:00:44,118 --> 01:00:47,379
l've misjudged you, Wang Yang!

770
01:00:48,153 --> 01:00:50,370
Meng Fa, tell him to get out!

771
01:00:50,415 --> 01:00:53,475
Master Wang, if you wish to leave

772
01:00:53,547 --> 01:00:55,491
we can't make you stay!

773
01:00:55,564 --> 01:00:57,711
Do you need help to pack?

774
01:00:57,757 --> 01:01:00,746
No thanks. l can handle it

775
01:01:00,783 --> 01:01:03,772
Goodbye, Master Meng

776
01:02:20,077 --> 01:02:24,145
Remember you said

777
01:02:24,182 --> 01:02:28,381
you'll bother no one if they leave you alone?

778
01:02:44,154 --> 01:02:45,019
After him!

779
01:02:45,093 --> 01:02:46,231
Yes!

780
01:02:49,129 --> 01:02:50,374
You're hurt!

781
01:02:50,451 --> 01:02:52,218
Hide in my room!

782
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:54,371
Aren't you afraid?

783
01:02:54,452 --> 01:02:55,483
Don't say that now!

784
01:02:55,531 --> 01:02:57,440
Go over there!

785
01:03:02,907 --> 01:03:03,974
Get in!

786
01:03:08,961 --> 01:03:10,099
Jia Jia

787
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:14,237
Jia Jia

788
01:03:15,189 --> 01:03:17,336
Wang Yang ran away after he wounded our men

789
01:03:17,416 --> 01:03:18,483
The Chief thinks it's not safe here

790
01:03:18,529 --> 01:03:20,402
l'm here to look in on you

791
01:03:20,478 --> 01:03:22,530
There's no one here!

792
01:03:22,704 --> 01:03:23,735
Yes!

793
01:03:23,783 --> 01:03:25,656
You can't go in!

794
01:03:41,527 --> 01:03:42,427
No one's here!

795
01:03:42,467 --> 01:03:44,483
No?

796
01:03:44,624 --> 01:03:46,533
l'll tell the Chief

797
01:03:46,607 --> 01:03:47,710
about this situation

798
01:03:47,755 --> 01:03:50,874
Bring more men and search the neighborhood

799
01:03:51,688 --> 01:03:54,807
Wang Yang's wounded, he won' get far!

800
01:03:55,096 --> 01:03:56,104
Go!

801
01:04:06,405 --> 01:04:07,436
l was so scared!

802
01:04:07,483 --> 01:04:09,464
Where were you?

803
01:04:12,528 --> 01:04:14,639
Jia Jia, looks like...

804
01:04:14,685 --> 01:04:16,761
l'll have to stay here for a few days

805
01:04:16,843 --> 01:04:18,752
Can you do me a favor?

806
01:05:13,312 --> 01:05:15,079
Zhou Ping, the boss is looking for you

807
01:05:15,121 --> 01:05:16,129
l'm busy

808
01:05:16,443 --> 01:05:18,281
l'm busy

809
01:05:22,532 --> 01:05:24,513
Are you looking for me, Miss?

810
01:05:34,048 --> 01:05:38,045
Don't worry, l know what to do

811
01:06:05,293 --> 01:06:06,301
This is too easy

812
01:06:06,371 --> 01:06:08,482
l'll go back and bring more men

813
01:06:08,563 --> 01:06:12,453
We'll kill all the Zhous

814
01:06:12,494 --> 01:06:13,739
No, that's not a good idea

815
01:06:14,547 --> 01:06:15,685
You can't just target the Zhous

816
01:06:15,731 --> 01:06:17,712
while the Mengs are spared

817
01:06:17,748 --> 01:06:18,815
That's right!

818
01:06:18,896 --> 01:06:20,769
l have thought this out

819
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:23,063
l'll rob the Mengs as well

820
01:06:23,106 --> 01:06:26,095
Kill a few of your men who are disobedient

821
01:06:26,169 --> 01:06:28,245
Then no one will suspect anything

822
01:06:28,291 --> 01:06:29,299
Good! When are you leaving?

823
01:06:29,334 --> 01:06:30,437
First thing tomorrow morning

824
01:06:35,527 --> 01:06:36,594
Jia Jia

825
01:06:38,589 --> 01:06:39,656
Get in!

826
01:06:39,842 --> 01:06:41,609
What have you found out?

827
01:06:41,686 --> 01:06:42,895
l saw Sha Er Lang

828
01:06:42,938 --> 01:06:45,963
lt was him

829
01:06:46,035 --> 01:06:48,917
They thought you were dead

830
01:06:48,992 --> 01:06:52,325
and are plotting against the Zhou clan

831
01:06:53,098 --> 01:06:53,334
When will they take action?

832
01:06:53,411 --> 01:06:55,284
Sha Er Lang will leave early tomorrow

833
01:06:55,325 --> 01:06:57,269
to get more help

834
01:06:57,308 --> 01:06:59,561
l must arrest him

835
01:06:59,604 --> 01:07:01,620
and expose their conspiracy

836
01:07:01,657 --> 01:07:03,601
This is the only chance

837
01:07:03,675 --> 01:07:05,619
lt will...

838
01:07:05,659 --> 01:07:08,814
prevent a disaster for both clans

839
01:09:52,537 --> 01:09:53,697
Go!

840
01:09:59,644 --> 01:10:00,702
Go!

841
01:10:11,723 --> 01:10:14,692
Go!

842
01:10:34,812 --> 01:10:36,685
Master, do you know...

843
01:10:36,726 --> 01:10:38,742
he's Sha Er Lang the robber?

844
01:10:38,813 --> 01:10:40,757
He colluded with Meng Er Da

845
01:10:40,796 --> 01:10:42,040
Chief Zhou heard about it

846
01:10:42,848 --> 01:10:44,092
l know

847
01:10:44,169 --> 01:10:46,979
l'll have Fatty alert the district office

848
01:10:47,057 --> 01:10:49,132
and take him into custody

849
01:10:49,179 --> 01:10:50,352
Remind Fatty

850
01:10:50,431 --> 01:10:52,506
not to mention my name

851
01:10:57,736 --> 01:11:01,590
Outside...hurry

852
01:11:06,816 --> 01:11:08,060
Wang Yang, you're under arrest

853
01:11:08,102 --> 01:11:11,091
Strange! They're here already!

854
01:11:11,164 --> 01:11:13,346
Looks like they came for you

855
01:11:14,121 --> 01:11:17,311
You're right!

856
01:11:17,426 --> 01:11:20,450
Go outside before you get into trouble!

857
01:11:20,661 --> 01:11:22,569
Hurry!

858
01:11:25,879 --> 01:11:27,823
Sir...

859
01:11:27,862 --> 01:11:28,965
Sitting over there

860
01:11:29,775 --> 01:11:30,984
is Sha Er Lang the robber

861
01:11:31,027 --> 01:11:33,138
Why are you after a Yang?

862
01:11:33,949 --> 01:11:35,052
There's no one here by that name

863
01:11:35,097 --> 01:11:37,243
ls Wang Yang inside?

864
01:11:37,289 --> 01:11:40,278
See for yourself? There's no one here

865
01:11:40,315 --> 01:11:41,453
except me

866
01:11:41,498 --> 01:11:44,451
He's lying

867
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:46,506
Wang Yang is inside

868
01:11:46,681 --> 01:11:48,732
You'll go tojail for abetting a criminal

869
01:11:48,768 --> 01:11:50,784
We'll arrest you too

870
01:11:50,856 --> 01:11:52,800
Arrest me?

871
01:11:52,873 --> 01:11:53,976
Zhou Ping, come inside

872
01:11:54,021 --> 01:11:56,001
They came for me

873
01:11:56,909 --> 01:11:58,960
What's going on?

874
01:12:09,675 --> 01:12:11,442
Go!

875
01:12:59,455 --> 01:13:00,522
Go!

876
01:13:04,917 --> 01:13:06,968
Help me, Master!

877
01:13:07,908 --> 01:13:08,916
Hold on!

878
01:13:14,135 --> 01:13:15,166
After them!

879
01:13:16,152 --> 01:13:18,334
Go...

880
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:26,654
Maybe they didn't catch Wang Yang

881
01:13:26,693 --> 01:13:29,610
l'll tell the Chief

882
01:13:37,129 --> 01:13:40,224
Zhou Ping, looks like

883
01:13:40,295 --> 01:13:42,275
we'll have to stay here

884
01:13:42,312 --> 01:13:44,328
for at least 6 months

885
01:13:44,364 --> 01:13:48,467
until things die down

886
01:13:49,443 --> 01:13:50,723
During this period

887
01:13:50,765 --> 01:13:53,884
l'll teach you my skill with the rod

888
01:13:54,696 --> 01:13:57,886
Then l'll get Meng Er Da to clear my name

889
01:13:57,931 --> 01:14:00,113
l hope you'll practice hard

890
01:14:00,158 --> 01:14:04,047
and pass on my skill

891
01:14:04,123 --> 01:14:08,250
You must obey 3 disciplines and 5 commandments

892
01:14:08,298 --> 01:14:10,373
What are they?

893
01:14:10,419 --> 01:14:14,689
Respect your teachers & ancestors, obey them

894
01:14:14,734 --> 01:14:19,668
No adultery and treachery

895
01:14:19,742 --> 01:14:25,091
No lies, no dishonesty

896
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:30,281
Do not be a bully and do not pass on your skill hastily

897
01:14:30,352 --> 01:14:31,419
l understand!

898
01:14:31,466 --> 01:14:36,471
The technique is to bind, point, strike and sweep

899
01:14:36,544 --> 01:14:38,595
This circular gateway...

900
01:14:38,597 --> 01:14:41,716
is to help you practice how to bind and point

901
01:14:41,797 --> 01:14:43,872
The purpose is...

902
01:14:43,954 --> 01:14:46,978
to confuse your opponent

903
01:14:47,015 --> 01:14:51,047
Shroud his weapon within the circle

904
01:14:52,233 --> 01:14:54,344
Take your chance to push it aside

905
01:14:54,390 --> 01:14:57,414
Then scurry forward

906
01:14:57,486 --> 01:15:00,640
And attack his vital organs

907
01:15:01,417 --> 01:15:04,820
Now you'll be using all your strength

908
01:15:05,592 --> 01:15:06,600
Later when you get a hang of the technique

909
01:15:06,635 --> 01:15:09,932
You'll have better control

910
01:15:10,009 --> 01:15:11,882
Here...

911
01:15:28,655 --> 01:15:30,563
Your turn!

912
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:33,827
Catch!

913
01:15:34,951 --> 01:15:37,868
This thing again?

914
01:15:38,152 --> 01:15:40,998
Get started now!

915
01:17:21,085 --> 01:17:22,329
Arms straight!

916
01:17:25,329 --> 01:17:26,573
Stand upright!

917
01:17:28,633 --> 01:17:30,577
Level your head

918
01:17:37,052 --> 01:17:39,032
Control your breathing

919
01:18:31,181 --> 01:18:33,054
Master

920
01:18:41,617 --> 01:18:43,692
This is to bind and point

921
01:19:11,881 --> 01:19:15,878
Your rod is lighter and longer

922
01:19:15,916 --> 01:19:17,860
Keep practicing

923
01:19:18,977 --> 01:19:20,080
Yes!

924
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:29,551
Use these bricks

925
01:19:29,587 --> 01:19:32,576
to form a circle

926
01:19:33,587 --> 01:19:37,820
The one holding the rod stays inside

927
01:19:37,901 --> 01:19:42,099
Keep your opponent on the outside

928
01:19:43,015 --> 01:19:45,161
Remember, don't ever let him

929
01:19:45,206 --> 01:19:47,222
cut inside the circle

930
01:19:48,163 --> 01:19:49,301
l understand!

931
01:19:49,381 --> 01:19:53,378
Focus on the rod

932
01:19:53,451 --> 01:19:57,483
Be decisive and don't stall

933
01:19:57,521 --> 01:19:59,537
Yes!

934
01:19:59,608 --> 01:20:00,616
Come!

935
01:20:04,930 --> 01:20:07,005
Level the rod!

936
01:20:09,001 --> 01:20:10,245
Level the rod!

937
01:20:11,052 --> 01:20:13,198
Guard all directions

938
01:20:30,846 --> 01:20:35,044
That's an excellent block!

939
01:20:36,238 --> 01:20:38,349
Shoulder the rod

940
01:20:39,369 --> 01:20:41,480
Strike with both ends

941
01:20:54,919 --> 01:20:56,899
Find a weak spot on the right

942
01:20:56,971 --> 01:20:59,188
Turn and aim for the Ling Tai acupoint

943
01:20:59,232 --> 01:21:01,070
l understand

944
01:21:03,406 --> 01:21:06,395
Cut in from the left

945
01:21:06,467 --> 01:21:08,483
Aim for the Qi Men acupoint

946
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:09,658
Yes!

947
01:21:14,852 --> 01:21:18,955
Stand like ajoss stick, change your posture

948
01:21:18,991 --> 01:21:23,094
Be dormant, yet alert. Speed is of the essence

949
01:21:23,131 --> 01:21:26,190
Move only when your opponent moves

950
01:21:26,227 --> 01:21:29,381
When he moves, you move even faster

951
01:21:38,785 --> 01:21:39,888
Sweep with force

952
01:21:55,586 --> 01:21:57,566
Point with strength

953
01:22:02,787 --> 01:22:05,882
Treat me as your enemy and not your master

954
01:22:05,918 --> 01:22:07,021
Move in!

955
01:22:08,979 --> 01:22:10,117
Attack!

956
01:22:10,162 --> 01:22:14,051
You said move only when you move

957
01:22:14,093 --> 01:22:17,212
And l'll move faster than you

958
01:22:18,441 --> 01:22:20,349
Good!

959
01:22:23,451 --> 01:22:24,589
Here l come!

960
01:23:07,490 --> 01:23:11,416
Aim for the chest when you attack

961
01:23:12,604 --> 01:23:14,620
Aim for the legs when you retreat

962
01:23:27,110 --> 01:23:28,141
Backward thrust

963
01:23:28,258 --> 01:23:30,333
Backward thrust?

964
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:32,360
l didn't teach you this

965
01:23:32,433 --> 01:23:33,333
Where did you learn this?

966
01:23:33,372 --> 01:23:34,545
You were pressuring me

967
01:23:34,590 --> 01:23:36,641
l improvised

968
01:23:37,651 --> 01:23:39,726
Brilliant!

969
01:23:49,965 --> 01:23:52,111
Look at you!

970
01:23:52,191 --> 01:23:53,294
You forgot everything!

971
01:23:53,339 --> 01:23:57,336
Your enemy will bite you if your corner him

972
01:23:57,375 --> 01:23:58,548
Never forget this!

973
01:24:29,726 --> 01:24:36,925
Point! Go!

974
01:24:41,206 --> 01:24:47,528
Point! Go!

975
01:24:49,415 --> 01:24:52,605
Stay within the circle

976
01:24:53,729 --> 01:25:00,988
Strike with force

977
01:25:01,034 --> 01:25:02,978
Circle!

978
01:25:06,113 --> 01:25:10,383
Don't move unless your opponent moves

979
01:25:10,427 --> 01:25:16,475
When he moves, you move even faster

980
01:25:17,732 --> 01:25:21,930
Circle! Point!

981
01:25:22,810 --> 01:25:25,027
On the right

982
01:25:37,420 --> 01:25:41,582
A small gift...thank you

983
01:25:55,266 --> 01:25:57,377
Master Sha

984
01:26:00,484 --> 01:26:03,508
You must have heard

985
01:26:03,546 --> 01:26:05,621
the situation can go either way

986
01:26:05,668 --> 01:26:08,763
lf you do as Chief Meng says

987
01:26:08,833 --> 01:26:10,908
you'll get away scott free

988
01:26:10,955 --> 01:26:12,828
Tell me!

989
01:26:13,007 --> 01:26:15,118
You must testify in court that

990
01:26:15,164 --> 01:26:19,196
you collaborated with Wang Yang to split the loot

991
01:26:19,269 --> 01:26:22,364
Don't forget to implicate Zhou Zhen Xian

992
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:25,590
Tell them he's an accomplice

993
01:26:26,539 --> 01:26:29,693
This is ruthless!

994
01:26:29,740 --> 01:26:32,621
Wang Yang is finished

995
01:26:33,706 --> 01:26:34,677
For sure!

996
01:26:34,750 --> 01:26:37,809
A criminal's testimony carries weight

997
01:26:37,845 --> 01:26:39,896
How can you call me a criminal?

998
01:26:40,141 --> 01:26:42,085
No...

999
01:26:44,142 --> 01:26:46,193
What's in it for me?

1000
01:26:47,516 --> 01:26:50,362
You'll be set free when the time is right

1001
01:26:50,404 --> 01:26:53,463
You may go anywhere you please

1002
01:26:53,499 --> 01:26:55,823
lt's a deal!

1003
01:26:56,595 --> 01:26:57,733
Pass a message to Chief Meng

1004
01:26:57,813 --> 01:26:58,916
lf he doesn't keep his promise

1005
01:26:58,961 --> 01:27:02,922
l'll change my testimony

1006
01:27:03,031 --> 01:27:07,063
We're in this together

1007
01:28:12,778 --> 01:28:16,881
Uncle, we have settled everything

1008
01:28:16,952 --> 01:28:21,114
But Sha Er Lang is still in jail

1009
01:28:21,161 --> 01:28:24,315
Do we still need him?

1010
01:28:24,362 --> 01:28:28,394
l don't think so, let's...

1011
01:28:28,432 --> 01:28:32,559
That's easy. l just need your consent

1012
01:28:32,641 --> 01:28:36,839
Have you located Jia Jia?

1013
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:38,864
Not yet!

1014
01:28:38,902 --> 01:28:41,997
l heard that when Wang Yang was wounded

1015
01:28:42,069 --> 01:28:46,030
he hid in her room

1016
01:28:46,069 --> 01:28:48,357
l can't believe after all these years

1017
01:28:48,435 --> 01:28:51,459
she'll turn against me! Keep looking!

1018
01:28:51,496 --> 01:28:52,504
Yes!

1019
01:28:54,522 --> 01:28:55,625
Master Sha!

1020
01:28:56,714 --> 01:28:58,694
lt's me!

1021
01:28:58,766 --> 01:28:59,774
Meng Fa!

1022
01:29:05,932 --> 01:29:07,105
Master Sha!

1023
01:29:09,063 --> 01:29:11,043
When do l break out ofjail?

1024
01:29:11,115 --> 01:29:13,403
Today, but you're not breaking out

1025
01:29:13,481 --> 01:29:17,370
You're walking out of here

1026
01:29:17,411 --> 01:29:19,462
Have a drink first

1027
01:29:26,804 --> 01:29:28,013
Magistrate Wang is not here

1028
01:29:28,821 --> 01:29:31,145
l'll go wait for his reply. Help yourself!

1029
01:29:32,196 --> 01:29:33,167
Please!

1030
01:29:33,205 --> 01:29:35,043
Hurry!

1031
01:29:38,283 --> 01:29:41,508
See you later, Master Sha!

1032
01:30:24,237 --> 01:30:25,268
You...

1033
01:30:25,350 --> 01:30:26,250
Well?

1034
01:30:26,289 --> 01:30:28,233
Master, look

1035
01:30:31,577 --> 01:30:32,548
Master Wang

1036
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:36,581
Jia Jia, how did you find us?

1037
01:30:36,621 --> 01:30:38,803
lt's destiny, Master!

1038
01:30:38,882 --> 01:30:39,985
Here we are, together again!

1039
01:30:40,761 --> 01:30:42,907
Let's sit down and talk!

1040
01:30:44,066 --> 01:30:48,169
Zhou Ping, run 10 laps around the tree

1041
01:30:48,205 --> 01:30:50,221
l'm tired already

1042
01:30:50,257 --> 01:30:51,430
Let me rest!

1043
01:30:52,205 --> 01:30:56,403
No! Run...

1044
01:30:56,483 --> 01:30:58,665
Please sit down! Run!

1045
01:31:01,667 --> 01:31:05,794
The Mengs are getting increasingly suspicious

1046
01:31:05,876 --> 01:31:07,927
l couldn't stay there any longer

1047
01:31:07,963 --> 01:31:10,952
So l ran away during the night

1048
01:31:11,025 --> 01:31:12,234
How is the situation?

1049
01:31:12,277 --> 01:31:15,301
Sha Er Lang insists you're together with Chief Zhou

1050
01:31:15,374 --> 01:31:18,291
to rob the village and split the loot

1051
01:31:18,330 --> 01:31:20,512
Notices were put out for your arrest

1052
01:31:20,556 --> 01:31:23,545
l overheard some news on the road

1053
01:31:23,617 --> 01:31:25,668
Zhou Zhen Xian and his sons

1054
01:31:25,704 --> 01:31:27,755
died tragically in jail

1055
01:31:27,827 --> 01:31:30,886
Many of the Zhou residences were closed

1056
01:31:30,958 --> 01:31:32,938
and their property confiscated

1057
01:31:33,009 --> 01:31:36,068
Outrageous!

1058
01:31:36,106 --> 01:31:38,288
Master, l can't run anymore!

1059
01:31:38,367 --> 01:31:41,248
l'll kill Meng Er Da

1060
01:31:41,498 --> 01:31:43,371
How many times did l tell you

1061
01:31:43,445 --> 01:31:46,706
to stay calm; look at you...

1062
01:31:47,585 --> 01:31:49,636
Even if l fight Meng Er Da

1063
01:31:49,673 --> 01:31:51,855
l may not defeat him, let alone you!

1064
01:31:51,934 --> 01:31:54,851
Then we're not avenging the Zhous?

1065
01:31:54,925 --> 01:31:56,028
Of course not!

1066
01:31:56,074 --> 01:31:58,955
Before we finish practicing

1067
01:31:59,031 --> 01:32:01,142
the double rod

1068
01:32:01,222 --> 01:32:03,166
we can't go back!

1069
01:32:07,553 --> 01:32:08,584
Look!

1070
01:32:09,362 --> 01:32:11,579
Here's the correspondence of Sha Er Lang & Meng Er Da

1071
01:32:11,623 --> 01:32:12,594
Where did you get these?

1072
01:32:12,666 --> 01:32:15,725
Stole them from the study

1073
01:32:15,763 --> 01:32:17,814
lf l can't find you

1074
01:32:17,884 --> 01:32:20,030
l'll report to the local authorities

1075
01:32:20,077 --> 01:32:23,066
l hate every one of the Meng clan

1076
01:32:23,937 --> 01:32:27,270
We need your help on this

1077
01:32:27,346 --> 01:32:31,235
Don't go to the local authorities

1078
01:32:31,278 --> 01:32:34,503
Take it up with Commissioner Yang

1079
01:32:34,547 --> 01:32:37,606
l'll be back in 2 weeks

1080
01:32:37,644 --> 01:32:39,695
to settle the score with Meng Er Da

1081
01:32:45,088 --> 01:32:50,235
Uncle, Wang Yang is back!

1082
01:32:52,184 --> 01:32:53,215
Meng Fa!

1083
01:32:53,298 --> 01:32:57,330
Now you know l can predict the future

1084
01:33:06,899 --> 01:33:07,930
Master Wang

1085
01:33:08,012 --> 01:33:10,858
You already left with Zhou Ping

1086
01:33:10,899 --> 01:33:13,045
Why did you come back?

1087
01:34:28,056 --> 01:34:31,210
Zhou Ping, have you seen this before?

1088
01:34:31,256 --> 01:34:33,331
No, but it looks like fun!

1089
01:34:33,379 --> 01:34:34,517
Stand still!

1090
01:35:05,799 --> 01:35:08,716
Master, sweep from the left

1091
01:35:08,792 --> 01:35:10,772
This is really useful

1092
01:35:10,843 --> 01:35:13,060
You have been practicing with a fixed target

1093
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:17,172
Now you have a moving target, make use of it!

1094
01:35:17,210 --> 01:35:19,118
Thanks!

1095
01:35:19,158 --> 01:35:20,261
Steady...

1096
01:35:41,213 --> 01:35:43,121
Let me do this!

1097
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:44,263
Alright!

1098
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:33,311
Zhou Ping, step down!

1099
01:36:33,393 --> 01:36:35,195
Yes!

1100
01:36:38,471 --> 01:36:42,741
You're asking for trouble!

1101
01:36:42,785 --> 01:36:48,941
Wang Yang, you should just stay away

1102
01:36:50,055 --> 01:36:53,008
To avenge Chief Zhou and his family

1103
01:36:53,047 --> 01:36:56,142
To expose the conspiracy in Dama Bay

1104
01:36:56,212 --> 01:37:00,445
To find the instigator behind Sha Er Lang's plot

1105
01:37:00,491 --> 01:37:02,471
l must come back

1106
01:37:02,508 --> 01:37:06,706
l can't let the culprit go unpunished

1107
01:37:07,588 --> 01:37:10,921
Yes, l did all of that

1108
01:37:11,692 --> 01:37:14,882
Unfortunately your enthusiasm

1109
01:37:14,963 --> 01:37:18,995
will be wasted on the dust under my feet

1110
01:37:48,322 --> 01:37:52,390
l've seen this trick before

1111
01:37:52,428 --> 01:37:54,539
l won't fall for it!

1112
01:37:54,758 --> 01:37:56,631
Let me...

1113
01:39:31,535 --> 01:39:33,610
Why didn't you teach me this?

1114
01:39:33,692 --> 01:39:35,636
l am teaching you now

1115
01:39:36,614 --> 01:39:37,787
Stay back!

1116
01:39:40,023 --> 01:39:42,003
Here he comes

1117
01:40:18,392 --> 01:40:20,408
You're bound to lose!

1118
01:40:20,445 --> 01:40:21,689
Allow me, Master!

1119
01:40:24,584 --> 01:40:26,766
Come on! What's the matter?

1120
01:40:29,802 --> 01:40:32,090
Zhou Ping, let him take the initiative

1121
01:40:32,133 --> 01:40:35,050
You're not up to standard, don't move!

1122
01:40:35,194 --> 01:40:37,067
Level the rod!

1123
01:41:17,982 --> 01:41:21,041
l've used the backward thrust again!

1124
01:41:21,078 --> 01:41:24,067
lmprovising is good!

1125
01:41:42,994 --> 01:41:44,867
Zhou Ping

1126
01:43:03,281 --> 01:43:05,189
We have already crippled him

1127
01:43:05,229 --> 01:43:07,446
Let him rot in prison

1128
01:43:08,256 --> 01:43:13,497
Uncle...

1129
01:43:18,901 --> 01:43:21,854
The Commissioner is here...
