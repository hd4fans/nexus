00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:26,981
New York is still here.

2
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,682
We're here.
We're going to be here tomorrow.

3
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:31,093
This is the way
of life people want.

4
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:34,754
Democracy, the rule of law, people
treating each other decently...

5
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:38,265
people caring about each other,
and we're gonna prevail.

6
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:42,106
New York is gonna be here tomorrow
and it's gonna be here forever.

7
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:47,417
And this is the way of life that
people want throughout the world.

8
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:53,248
Daddy's home!

9
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:55,959
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

10
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,180
What are you doing here?

11
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:00,255
She's been dying to do that
for the past hour. Where were you?

12
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:03,159
What's she doing still up? l had
some paper and the traffic is horrible.

13
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,560
What are you doing
with the balloon?

14
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:05,359
Heavy traffic.

15
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:09,367
-Let us know next time.
-l will, l will.

16
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,634
What are you doing? You're going
to go upstairs and brush your teeth?

17
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:15,797
-Come on, go, go, go!
-Go. Get up there.

18
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:18,336
-You're going to tuck me in?
-Yeah of course.

19
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:21,279
l'm gonna check that toothbrush.

20
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:23,109
Dad!

21
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,479
So what,
they change her medication?

22
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:32,992
The doctor says we'll keep trying
different ones until the seizures stop.

23
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:35,187
That sounds like a genius plan.

24
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:38,053
That's where she got
the balloon then?

25
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,756
They're pretty nice in there.

26
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:46,034
-Except that one idiot.
-Who? Dr. Sing?

27
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,839
He talks to her like there's
something wrong with her.

28
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:51,403
What are you talking about?
He talks to her like she's five.

29
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:52,877
l can't stand him.
He's an asshole.

30
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,907
He is. . .
l'm sorry, l just. . .

31
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:59,611
l don't understand how they can
move you two hours away randomly.

32
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:02,784
-lt's ridiculous, you know it is.
-lt's temporary, isn't it, Ker?

33
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,323
-l don't care that it's temporary.
-Come on!

34
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,459
'Quality of Life' it's a bunch
of shit and you know it.

35
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,894
Daddy, l brushed my teeth.
l'm going to bed.

36
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,384
Okay, l'm coming up right now.

37
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:11,965
What do you want me to do?
l ain't got no seniority.

38
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,126
-Daddy! l brushed my teeth!
-Gotta finish this now.

39
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,565
l run in bed!

40
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,000
Okay, baby,
l'm coming up. Hold on.

41
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,036
l love you.
You stop it, okay?

42
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:27,546
-Hey you!
-Hay is for horses.

43
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,213
Yeah, it is.

44
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,978
How did Charlie
run again, Daddy?

45
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,478
How did Charlie run?
You know how Charlie ran.

46
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,388
And Charlie
was a good dog, right?

47
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,763
Yeah, what are you talking
about? He was the best.

48
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,571
And that's why you
named me Charlie, right?

49
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,562
Yeah. Psh.
We can't say that too loud.

50
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:56,899
Mommy still thinks l named
you after Grandma Charlotte.

51
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,145
Charlie?

52
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:10,615
Charlie!

53
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:22,364
You okay?

54
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:25,930
Okay.

55
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:30,271
You tired?

56
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:33,537
Okay.

57
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,975
You know all l ever dreamed about
was people like you and mommy.

58
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:48,652
Good night, baby.

59
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:53,991
And that's where
the castles were. . .

60
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:55,998
right?

61
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:00,305
-Where you grew up?
-That's right, baby.

62
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,043
The giant castles.

63
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,144
And they was as big as
the whole world?

64
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:16,578
Okay, go to sleep.

65
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,194
Good night, baby.

66
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,795
Milk! l want my gun!

67
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:11,778
l got the little motherfucker
down here in the apartment 1-C.

68
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,076
A little Casper motherfucker.

69
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,742
A little glow-in-the-dark motherfucker
that they call Milk. Milk!

70
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:22,049
Little glow-in-the-dark Casper
motherfucker got my gun...

71
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:26,023
and l'm gonna get my shit, Milk!
Where's my goddamn gun, Milk?

72
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:28,856

Fuck you, Milk!

73
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:31,488

75
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:51,174
You glow-in the-dark
Casper motherfucker!

77
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,818
-Get the fuck out! Get out!
-Shut up!

78
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:05,830
Get outta here, Hanky!
Go to your own fucking house!

79
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:13,966
Vinny?

80
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,143
Vinny!

81
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,562
Seeing it is, in person...

82
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:40,157
is very different than seeing it
on television or seeing pictures of it.

83
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:44,903
lt gives you a sense of the devastation
that was accomplished there.

84
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,245
Retiring Police Commissioner,
Charles Stanford...

85
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:00,787
and his predicted successor,
Captain Marion Mathers...

86
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,482
are coming under
continued scrutiny...

87
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,191
of the Quality of Life raid here
at the Queensboro Projects...

88
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,726
on Christmas Eve.
Locals are saying...

89
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,995
this didn't have a whole
lot to do with safer streets.

90
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,929
lt had a lot more to do
with real estate.

91
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:14,534
A deal to turn the coveted
waterfront property into condos.

92
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:15,398
l fucking live here!

93
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:17,537
Osama Bin Laden
and other terrorists...

94
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:18,504
are still in hiding.

95
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:19,868
Our message to them is clear.

96
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,496
No matter how long it takes...

97
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,744
America will find you
and we will bring you to justice.

98
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:28,305
-l fucking live here! We live here!
-You live here? We know that.

99
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:38,454
All right, back up! Back up!

100
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:45,765
Captain Mathers,
l talked to one woman. . .

101
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,900
who said that the 1 18
isn't welcome here.

102
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,302
You're causing trouble
by being here tonight.

103
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,236
What we're doing. . .

104
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:52,204
is we're making a dangerous
neighborhood safer.

105
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:53,966
So that, the good citizens
who live here...

106
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,735
we want them
to enjoy their holidays.

107
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,572
-They don't agree with you.
-Well, that's what we're doing.

108
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:18,452
l'm a cop.

109
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:20,857
Fuck.

110
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:29,138
Twenty in, twenty right out.
Johnny.

111
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,815
Twenty in twenty out,
twenty in, twenty out. . .

112
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:37,578
that's what l fucking
tell myself every day.

113
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,118
twenty in, twenty out,
twenty in, twenty out. . .

114
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,450
twenty in, twenty out,
twenty in, twenty out.

115
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,122
Jesus, you're
a fucking rookie at 30?

116
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,960
Shit. My 30th birthday. . .

117
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,450
l was halfway to retirement.

118
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:53,795
So you just spent your fucking
twentys, having fun, being free.

119
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,333
Bullshit. Eating pussy.

120
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:58,860
You've ask me this every day,
since l've transferred here.

121
00:08:58,971 --> 00:08:59,562
Yep.

122
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:05,305
You know record shop, 7-1 1 's,
they're not that exciting.

123
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,811
Fuck excitement.

124
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,575
You know, l feel bad
for you, old man.

125
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:13,386
One day, you're fucking pulling
over these hot ltalian chicks. . .

126
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,580
the next with this shit?

127
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:19,152
Fuck.
Everybody hates America.

128
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,785
Meanwhile, what the fuck is anyone
else doing for the rest of the world?

129
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,231
Where's my money?
You got my money?

130
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:35,031
She's Olive Oyl.
Pick that stink bitch up.

131
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:38,109
-See you two at the precinct.
-You got it.

132
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,617
Olive? Hey, Olive.

133
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:58,152
-Take that son of a bitch in!
-All right, all right.

134
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:04,135
-Come on, get in the car. Get in.
-You're going to the car. Get in.

135
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:06,872
Right after you,
you bonny-assed motherfucker!

136
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:07,531
Shut up.

137

Fuck you!

138
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,768
You're gonna
fucking regret that later.

139
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,748
What are you doing?
Get outta here!

All right, all right. You know what?
Keep them separated.

147
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,923
Look who's here.

Not over here.
Not over here!

Are you going flying today,

151
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:12,697
lt smells like he flew out
of somebody's ass, Cap.

152

You going flying?
Look at him.

153
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,009

Easy, Olive. What about you?

l don't know.
l mean, l'd rather not.

156
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,749
You know what we'd rather
not do is smell like shit. . .

157
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,051
when we go home
to our wives.

158
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,219
When the old man steps down,
you can beat out of anybody you want.

159
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:29,119
l'll kill you!
l'll kill you!

160
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,118
Yeah, get him.

161
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,998
All right, all right.

162
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:40,989
Get off me! Fuck you!

163
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,960
Sit down.
Sit down.

164
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,571
-Way to go, Olive.
-Fuck you!

165
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,038
How'd you get
the weekends off?

166
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:51,004
Just told them l wasn't
gonna transfer here without it.

167
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:56,572
Man, Mathers must have
wanted you pretty bad.

168
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:01,446
All right.
l'll see you on Monday.

169
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:02,916
Yeah, man.

170
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:06,389
Listen, think of me
from your 7 /1 1's and shit.

171
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,024
And Mathers said
to look at that shit!

172
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,682
The city's in
an elevated Code Yellow. . .

173
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,150
and this fucker
we should be looking. . .

174
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,753
into some unsolved shit
from 16 years ago.

175
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:37,120
-Excuse me, sir?
-What, are you in the Army?

176
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,187
No, no, l'm just. . .

177
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,828
Fucker can't even
sign his own name.

178
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:49,531
lt's the third month in a row.

179
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,233
This reporter's making
a career out of it.

180
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,968
lt's the first l heard of it.

181
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,574
Now that you're here,
you should be aware of it.

182
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:34,480
l didn't even want this.
l told him to stop coming to me.

183
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,811
This is where l live.

184
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:51,392
This is where l live!

185
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:54,700
l got the little motherfucker
down here in apartment number 1-C.

186
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,395
This is where live!

187
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:12,309
Grandmother, she's an old lady.
He takes the checks and. . .

188
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,177
l thought he was gonna kill me.

189
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,321
l thought he
was gonna kill me.

190
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:32,333
My grandmother does nothing! She's
an old lady. She doesn't do anything!

191
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:40,611
Shit! Pretend you're
taking a shit or something.

192
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,682
You can't even knock? You just
walk in people's houses and shit?

193
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,050
Listen, teenager.
l got to take a shit.

194
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,848
l'll take a shit right here,
right now. Outta my way.

195
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,717
What the fuck!

196
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,434
What kind
of fucking butcher shop?

197
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,484
He comes every day.

198
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,924
He takes the checks
from the mailbox. . .

199
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:02,121
right from the mailbox.
And she doesn't do anything.

200
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:04,096
l just didn't want him
to come here anymore.

201
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:07,657
l saw when Louie died.
Cops were all laughing.

202
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,803
l thought he was gonna kill me.

203
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,134
We'll throw him in the garbage.

204
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,365
-He got a bullet in him, Vin.
-Shut the fuck, l don't care.

205
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:17,304
We're gonna throw his ass
in the garbage. No one gives a shit.

206
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:25,606
Yeah, the cops don't care.
No one does.

207
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:29,184
Yeah, trust me,
No one gives a shit.

208
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,251
Hey, baby.

209
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,290
Did Charlie run, Daddy?

210
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,826
He ran like this.

211
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:56,800
And he loved to hang
in the giant castle?

212
00:17:57,709 --> 00:18:00,234
That's right,
in the giant castles.

213
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:03,405
Okay, night.

214
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,400
You liked the circus, baby?

215
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,567
Of course she liked the circus.

216
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,499
l loved the circus.

217
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:34,438
Loved the circus!

218
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:58,695
l'm gonna stop by the precinct.
l left my cell phone there.

219
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,405
And then we're gonna
watch Sponge Bob, right?

220
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,909
No secrets!
You were whispering!

221
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,809
Daddy was just saying
this is where he grew up.

222
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:08,606
Did you know that?
ln one of these buildings.

223
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,879
The giant castles.

224
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:28,290
Come on.

225
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:42,778
Nice hip pack.

226
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:46,150
Family outing at the 1 18, man.
You ran out of shit to do on the island?

227
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:48,186
We came in from the city.
We went to the circus.

228
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:49,821
-This is Kerry.
-Hi, yeah, Kerry and Charlotte.

229
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:53,621
-Hi, did you see some lions?
-Charlie loves the lions, right?

230
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,228
-Everybody loves lions, man.
-Come here.

231
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:58,890
You're bringing two pretty ladies
up in this shithole? What's up?

232
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:00,332
You can sit right here, okay?

233
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,334
l'm gonna be right back. l'm gonna
get my cell phone out of my locker.

234
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,603
All right, man. l'll be up here.
l'm taking care of them.

235
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:05,627
-l'll be right back.
-All right.

236
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,265
Char?

237
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:44,005
-What are you doing?
-We were playing with the breathalyzer.

238
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:46,812
Stop it. This stuff's filthy.
You don't touch this stuff around here.

239
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:49,804
-We were just fucking around here.
-Really? You don't know that well.

240
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:52,977
-You understand?
-Really?

241
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:57,420
Kerry, come on.

242
00:20:57,889 --> 00:20:58,514
Really?

243
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:01,088
Come on, baby.

244
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:04,821
There she goes.

245
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:09,033
Have a safe trip
back to the island.

246
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:37,291
lt's a desire and a chance to react
under certain circumstances.

247
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:39,626
The economy reacted,
the stock market too.

248
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:41,933
New York is on track to a rebound.

249
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,424
lt's just a year
after many have said...

250
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:48,837
that a city like New York
couldn't bounce back

251
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:50,875
And see what happened
to the market.

252
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,740
This boy, Milk,
done took my gun.

253
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:08,359
You get a murder on Whitestone.

254
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:09,416
The kids are crying. You know?

255
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:13,330
Parents givin' 'em
days off of school.

256
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:18,559
The children here are different.

257
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,756
You see them from your window?

258
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:47,797
Don't worry. They'll do their
shit and then they'll leave.

259
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,565
We just can't say nothing.

260
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:52,992
l gotta go.

261
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:55,469
You better not say
nothing, Vicky!

262
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,539
-Everybody's freaking out now.
-l know.

263
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,302
But l gotta get home.

264
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:04,607
Please, just chill.

265
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:06,844
My mother's boyfriend is here. . .

266
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,180
and l don't wanna deal
with that.

267
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:09,488
He got a bullet in him, Vin.

268
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:12,150
l know that.
You don't think l know that?

269
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:17,587
-What do you want me to do?
-Just l gotta go home.

270
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:19,654
l'm serious.
What do you want me to do?

271
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,460
l don't know!
l'm going home.

272
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:34,112
Jonathan, your grandma
took the dog out.

273
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:36,171
So l was here just
looking at an old picture.

274
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:40,349
And l thought maybe you
and l could talk for a minute.

275
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:46,248
How about we go outside?
Nice day today.

276
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,726
Just you and me. . .

277
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:50,957
sit somewhere, just talk
a little bit. ls that all right?

278
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:55,460
lt'll be fine. lt'll be fine.

279
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,920
You seem a little
shook up, Jonathan.

280
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:17,780
A reason for that?

281
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,200
lt ain't easy
growing up around here.

282
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:34,600
l could imagine,
especially without a father.

283
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:38,132
He was a good man.

284
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:40,474
Your father.

285
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,355
You know why l brought you
out here though, don't you?

286
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:00,989
With all of them
looking at us wondering...

287
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:06,905
what's Detective Charlie,
white Officer Charlie. . .

288
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:09,897
doing talking
with little white Jonathan?

289
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:11,408
What are they talking about?

290
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:16,882
And a few of them are particularly
concerned about some dead junkie. . .

291
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:19,749
last seen going through your door. . .

292
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:24,978
and then winding up about
twenty feet from that same door.

293
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:30,393
You don't know why?

294
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,309
You're a deer in the jungle here,
my boy.

295
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,706
And that fellow, Hanky...

296
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:52,977
he wasn't worth
two damn cents, Milk.

297
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:57,619
Yeah, that's what
they call you, right? Milk?

298
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,023
l'm just talking.
lt's over.

299
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:11,200
You can go. But you hear anything,
you come talk to Officer Charlie.

300
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:12,929
Okay.

301
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,267
Good seeing you Jonathan!

302
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:35,258
Charlie?

303
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:57,512
Someone can tell me sitting
in my hallway is a fucking crime?

304
00:26:57,582 --> 00:26:59,284
Fuck you outta here!
Fuck that shit!

305
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,684
Fuck you!
Fuck that shit, motherfucker!

306
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:08,490
White, Prudenti! Come here.
Let's take a walk. Outside.

307
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:12,060
Olive Oyl, you look beautiful,
sweetheart.

308
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:17,562
Fucking asylum in there.

309
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:20,632
Jesus. . . Look.

310
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:24,232
l need you go over to the Gazette's
offices, over there by Ditmars.

311
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,640
l want you to talk
to the writer.

312
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:28,611
Tell her she's not hunting
the fucking Son of Sam here, right?

313
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,050
Tell her we're fighting a war on terror
in this fucking city already.

314
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,642
-No problem.
-Here, you take this.

315
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:37,222
Handle it.

316
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:38,023
Last thing we need. . .

317
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:41,925
is them demanding we reopen
some case 16 years ago.

318
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,023
None of us want that,
l imagine.

319
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:46,894
No. All right. Let's go.

320
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:47,989
-Just be safe.
-Okay.

321
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:51,326
Tell her to cut the shit.

322
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,884
l watched him die
in the heat of the sun.

323
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:16,025
Sucking up bullets
of a policeman's gun.

324
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:19,188
''Police at the 1 18 know.''
Listen to this fuck.

325
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:20,993
But Mathers said
it's bullshit though, right?

326
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,124
Yeah, it's all bullshit.

327
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,527
lf he was a man, he would have
signed his fucking name though.

328
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:48,686
God. . .

329
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,460
-Ms. Bridges?
-Lauren Bridges.

330
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,129
Like London bridges, right?

331
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:54,762
Just like that.

332
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:57,663
l know who you are.
Officer Prudenti.

333
00:28:58,636 --> 00:28:59,500
Yeah, that's right.

334
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:02,601
-You're new?
-Yes, madam. Jonathan White.

335
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:03,831
Pleased to meet you.

336
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:06,706
-Look at this.
-You like that?

337
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:08,880
Yeah, l do.
Look at these fucking assholes.

338
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,382
So Marion sent you.
l understand why you're here.

339
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:12,508
Captain Marion?

340
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,119
All l can say, as far as me
not printing them. . .

341
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,882
you came to the wrong person.

342
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:18,320
-We'd like to see the letters.
-Of course.

343
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:24,093
Tampered evidence
is wasted evidence.

344
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:28,531
You realize it's not actually evidence
until somebody gives a fuck about this.

345
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:33,695
-Are there any more?
-Only three.

346
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:36,339
Here on, the minute
they come in, l print them.

347
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:37,533
Like doughnuts, right?

348
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:43,246
l'd appreciate you stop
touching my shit. Thank you.

349
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:44,144
l'm sorry.

350
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:47,515
So l called Marion
after l received them. . .

351
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:49,579
and he couldn't give a damn.

352
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:52,757
Seems no one's interested
in the possibility. . .

353
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:57,091
of police doing anything corrupt,
since this whole 9/1 1 debacle.

354
00:29:57,228 --> 00:29:59,628
You must feel
like a real reporter then.

355
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:02,889
We have
a circulation of over 100,000.

356
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:05,270
You can tell me the last time
that many people. . .

357
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,999
knew a cop for a good reason?

358
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:11,132
Look, if you get another letter,
why don't you give us a call?

359
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,746
Officer, you do know
the hero tide will turn?

360
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,850
-My cell is on the back.
-Of course, you know no one. . .

361
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,841
stays loved
in New York for long.

362
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:28,722
What do you think?

363
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:30,658
What do l think?
l think she's a dyke.

364
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:05,219
Hello?

365
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:10,691
Milk?

366
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:14,431
Please, don't hang up.

367
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:20,038
You know, l would never
do any of that stuff.

368
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:24,008
Vin, l didn't see
anything anyways.

369
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:36,225
Do nothing. l swear.
l swear l wasn't gonna do nothing.

370
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:37,495
He just said,
if l didn't...

371
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:39,360
he'd tell my mother
to put me back in the hospital.

372
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,032
And if they put me back
in that hospital. . .

373
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:42,966
l can't do anything,
if anything happens to you.

374
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:44,092
l can do nothing.

375
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:47,795
What are you
talking about, Vin?

376
00:31:57,115 --> 00:32:00,573
You don't think l'm a faggot,
Milk, l'm not a faggot right?

377
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:01,277
No.

378
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:15,388
You're the only fucking person
in this whole world l can trust.

379
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,469
l hate it.
l hate it here so fucking much.

380
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:20,727
l fucking hate it here.

381
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:23,003
Me too.

382
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:36,510
Listen, Milk.

383
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:38,886
ln my mother's
boyfriend's apartment...

384
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:41,855
he has a thousand dollars.

385
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,963
l saw it, Milk.
A thousand dollars.

386
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,864
That's a lot of money.
l got the key.

387
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:52,503
l got the key to his apartment.
l can go in.

388
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:55,267
l can find it, Milk.
l know where it is. l saw it.

389
00:32:57,842 --> 00:33:01,972
l can take it. And, man,
we can get outta here, Milk.

390
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:04,241
We can get outta here.

391
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:06,814
Okay.

392
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,291
What's up, Milk?

393
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:28,635
You kids are cold-blooded.

394
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:33,574
Killing junkies, partying
and shit afterwards.

395
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:35,446
Vinny up there. . .

396
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:37,346
sucking his mama
boyfriend dick.

397
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:39,481
Fuck is that about?

398
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:44,384
Hanky OD'd in my apartment.

399
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,448
OD'd?

400
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:51,555
Fucker jumped in the bathtub
for one last bath.

401
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:57,758
Gun went off.
l could see that.

402
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:04,205
Anyway,
Hanky was a no-good junkie.

403
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:11,113
Junkie with a $300 tab
and a gun like this.

404
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,519
When l'm putting
the pieces together...

405
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,384
pieces of a fucking murder.

406
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:26,062
Somebody, definitely,
killed Hanky...

407
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:29,564
except me.

408
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:34,935
l'm not going to the cops.
They could give two shits about me.

409
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,631
l just want the $300
he owed me.

410
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:42,905
Listen, little man.

411
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:49,378
l want $300 or l'm gonna go
to the cops with this.

412
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,324
This shit still smell
like firecracker.

413
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:04,534
Get your ass inside.

414
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:43,104
What's going on?
Johnny?

415
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:45,339
Sorry l'm late, Ker.

416
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:50,805
What's going on for real?

417
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:54,914
What do you mean?

418
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,586
ls there someone else?

419
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:09,355
Are you kidding me?

420
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,565
l met you when you were
working in a record shop.

421
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,367
You take this ridiculous
police test. . .

422
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,500
because you're going to be right down
the street. Now you're two hours away. . .

423
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:21,044
and you're in no rush
to get home.

424
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:22,306
lt's temporary, Kerr.

425
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:25,375
Then why are you
getting home so late?

426
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,914
l just can't believe l ended up
at my father's old precinct.

427
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,257
l just can't believe
l ended up there.

428
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:42,931
l'm sorry.

429
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,972
l keep going by my old address
and l just look at it.

430
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,010
Who's there?

431
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:01,147
No one.

432
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:06,782
No one anymore.

433
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:15,356
White?

434
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,161
White. . .

435
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,841
l don't need to tell you
like l've been telling Prudenti. . .

436
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:26,071
which l'm sure you both
already know this.

437
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:27,700
But for the sake of clarity...

438
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:31,182
someone went in and tore the Gazette's
offices to shreds last night. . .

439
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:32,479
about 1 1 p.m.

440
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:38,279
l know Bridges for 15 years.
15 years l've known her.

441
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,087
She's relentless.

442
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,726
-Listen, Captain. . .
-No, you listen.

443
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,722
l don't give a shit who did this.
You know why?

444
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:50,460
Because l don't. But what l do
need is you both to go over there...

445
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,762
and tell her
that whoever did this...

446
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:56,370
is gonna be a top priority
on our list, whatever, anything.

447
00:37:57,174 --> 00:37:57,902
Okay?

448
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:01,404
And go on.

449
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:20,857
Ms. Bridges. l'm. . .

450
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,125
You came to have a good look
at the work you'd done?

451
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:28,464
l can assure you that we didn't
have anything to do with this.

452
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:31,975
You know every mafia wannabe
who grew up here became a cop?

453
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:35,780
Big facades with your hero
9/1 1 charity events. Fuck this!

454
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,112
lf l understood a fucking
word you just said. . .

455
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:38,949
l'm sure l'd have a comeback.

456
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:41,852
l can have a car come around
maybe a few extra times at night. . .

457
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:42,720
Are you sure that wasn't. . .

458
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,415
your captain's request last night?

459
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,646
Fuck her, let's go.

460
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:48,292
Goddamn frat boy.

461
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:52,422
Just contact me directly,
if you have any more problems.

462
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:53,894
l have one.

463
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:57,232
lt'll be the cover of our
next issue. Yeah, really.

464
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,631
You know what
a Mucky Pup is, Officer?

465
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:05,532
lt's the son of a copper.

466
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,914
You? You look like
the son of no one.

467
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:18,346
But you were the son
of Stanford's old partner.

468
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:23,321
You have my card.

469
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:28,429
Did she say
anything else in there?

470
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:30,864
Just that she won't stop
printing these letters. . .

471
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:32,266
and her place got tore up.

472
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,967
Diesel bitch.

473
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,407
Probably did it herself
looking for a story.

474
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:38,466
And still no one gives
a fuck out those letters.

475
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:39,833
Except for us.

476
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:42,742
Except you.

477
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:05,260
-You came here with that dog?
-l want him to come with us.

478
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,837
-They won't let him come.
-Who won't?

479
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:14,867
We don't even know
where we're going.

480
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:19,683
Just, just tie him up.
Just tie him up.

481
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:23,016
l just gotta get in this
guy's then we can go.

482
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:25,819
lt's under the couch.
Let's just get it and go.

483
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,624
-You have the key?
-lt's, it's right here.

484
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:37,296
We're just gonna get it
and then go.

485
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:38,365
ln and out.

486
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,505
Just close the door.

487
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,451
Charlie, stay quiet.

488
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,283
Just gotta get it and go.

489
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:02,222
Keep quiet. Stay quiet.

490
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:10,293
Shut that dog up!

491
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:22,205
Fuck ya'll doing in here?

492
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:24,515
-Nothing.
-What you two doing in here?

493
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:27,416
What's going on in there?

494
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,220
Charlie, stop!
Charlie, stop!

495
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:40,524
Get this motherfucker. Shut
this dog. You hearing me, man?

496
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:43,100
-Charlie, stop! Charlie, stop!
-Piece of shit!

497
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,568
Stop that!

498
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:08,319
Charlie. . .

499
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:12,687
Charlie?

500
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:16,560
Vinny!

501
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:30,310
Shit.

502
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:31,610
Hello?

503
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,310
Sounds like
your baby's crying.

504
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,018
Who is this?

505
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:41,719
What's the problem?

506
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,822
She doesn't like
her new medication?

507
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:44,917
Who is this?

508
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,693
When your husband
gets home tonight...

509
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:51,763
ask him about
two murders in 1986.

510
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:03,102
lt's okay. lt's okay.
Here, it's okay.

511
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:07,813
l'm not. . .
Keep your feet up.

512
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:18,987
Precinct 1 1 8.

513
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:20,524
Officer White, please.

514
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,826
Sure. Hold on.

515
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:25,024
White!
You got a call on line one.

516
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:26,662
This came for you, too.

00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:28,065
Thank you.

518
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:30,564

527
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:55,628
Jonathan!

528
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:00,434
What the fuck are you calling?
Are you kidding me?

529

-l'm sorry, he's Dominican!

532
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:12,106
You don't want this, man.

-Put it down, right fucking now.

535
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:18,022
Relax. l swear to God,
l'm gonna put one in your head!

536
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:19,490
He's calling it like bullshit.

537
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,151
-Just put that gun down. Put it down.
-l don't wanna do this!

538
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:23,383
l'm gonna put a fucking
bullet right in your head.

539
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:26,395
-Relax!
-l don't want this!

540
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:29,724
-l'm just trying to live.
-Come on.

541
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:32,163
l don't want this. l don't want this.
l don't want this.

542
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:36,229
Take him
in the fucking bathroom!

543
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:41,969
What the fuck is going on?

544
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:43,809
Motherfucker took
my fucking gun!

545
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:45,382
So what are you're
bringing him to the bathroom?

546
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:47,009
We are in the fucking '80s?

547
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:50,219
Cameras all over
the place here.

548
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,686
What's the matter with you?
Get this piece of shit up.

549
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:55,656
Bring him over to the desk,
rear cuff him.

550
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:02,664
People wonder why we pump
40 bullets in these fuckers.

551
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:05,223
Forty one!

552
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,831
l got half the city watching
my every fucking move...

553
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:15,935
and this asshole can't control
himself in his own precinct.

554
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:18,345
Look at him.

555
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:20,648
Look at him.
He thinks it's funny.

556
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,383
-l think it's funny.
-Look at him.

557
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:27,854
Yeah, he's laughing.
lt's like you're retarded.

558
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:31,826
Un-fucking-believable.

559
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:44,367
Let me ask you
something, Jonathan.

560
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:46,773
When you were out there. . .

561
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:50,438
did you feel like shooting
that piece of shit Puerto Rican?

562
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,905
Putting two in his head?

563
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:57,819
-Probably not the best idea.
-Why? Why is that?

564
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:03,485
We'd have your back.
lt's important that you know that.

565
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:06,964
lt's important
that you understand. . .

566
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:09,489
that that's not going above
and beyond the call of duty.

567
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:13,063
lt's doing your job.

568
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:14,504
lt's our job.

569
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:16,671
lt's what we do.

570
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:24,279
-Okay. Answer that.
-Sorry.

571
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,885
You take the night off.
You saved a cop's life today.

572
00:46:30,254 --> 00:46:32,051
Even if he is an asshole.

573
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:44,692
Kerry?

574
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:49,500
Why aren't you answering your phone?
l got a call.

575
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:54,141
He told me to ask you
about two murders in 1986.

576
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,013
What the fuck
is going on, Johnny?

577
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,933
They don't know anything, Jim.

578
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:20,002
They don't know
nothing about this.

579
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,374
This is life.

580
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:31,114
Everything you, you want
or care about in this world. . .

581
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:33,173
it ends up nowhere, right?

582
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:40,314
My mom says she's gonna
put me back in the hospital.

583
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,524
lt's like they're always
trying to get rid of me or something.

584
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:52,200
But when l get out,
l'm gonna get a job.

585
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:55,198
l'm gonna get enough money
to get an apartment. . .

586
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:57,763
and we're gonna be okay.

587
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:01,240
You're gonna be okay, Milk.

588
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,370
As long as we don't say nothing.

589
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:06,981
And l never will.

590
00:48:08,685 --> 00:48:09,982
l never will.

591
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:12,950
Vinny.

592
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:55,192
Hello?

593
00:48:56,099 --> 00:49:00,263
Ms. Carter? l was friends
with Vincent a long time ago.

594
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:03,336
l lived downstairs.
Milk.

595
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:14,350
l was here to see Vinny.

596
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:19,817
Jonathan! lt's so nice
to see you. Look at you.

597
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:22,693
You look like you're
doing well with yourself.

598
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:23,352
Vicky?

599
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,698
-You here for Vinny?
-Yes, is he here?

600
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:33,660
Vincent's not
the same boy you knew.

601
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:37,271
He is still my boy,
but he's not the one you knew.

602
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:42,242
l'm just gonna check up
on the roof real quick.

603
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,212
Jonathan, please
don't go up there.

604
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:46,812
The past bothers
Vincent a lot.

605
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,185
Jonathan, please!

606
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:21,910
Hey, Vinny.

607
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:27,119
Hey man.

608
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:36,427
lt's me...

609
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:40,393
lt's Jonathan.

610
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:47,338
Milk. My man, Milk.

611
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:53,505
Milk, my little man.

612
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,111
What's up, Milk?

613
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:02,817
Been a long time.

614
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:10,897
Yes, Milk.

615
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,604
Someone's calling
my house, Vinny.

616
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,212
Someone's
calling my house.

617
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:37,286
Yeah, he's talking to my wife.

618
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:46,964
He's calling my. . .

619
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:52,667
l always knew you
was gonna be good.

620
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:57,238
l always knew it.

621
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,017
l always knew it.

622
00:52:01,017 --> 00:52:04,544
-l know, man, but you got...
-l think l should go.

623
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,256
lf you're writing
letters, you gotta listen.

624
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:07,457
You're not hearing me.

625
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,860
lf you're writing these letters
you'll destroy our lives. You hear me?

626
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:10,690
Enough.

627
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:13,793
Enough.

628
00:52:36,953 --> 00:52:37,510
Hello?

629
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:41,580
Yeah, l'm on my way.

630
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,818
No, l'm coming home now.

631
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:47,589
All right.

632
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:13,116
What part of our conversation. . .

633
00:54:13,116 --> 00:54:14,517
made you take another
two hours to get home?

634
00:54:14,517 --> 00:54:16,519
-Did he call back?
-l am asking you a question.

635
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:18,121
Did he call back?
Kerry, l love you.

636
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:20,257
-l'm asking you a fucking question!
-Shut the fuck up, man!

637
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,658
You just can't fucking talk
to me right now!

638
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:22,826
l love you Kerry,
so just stop. Stop, all right?

639
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:24,561
Don't tell me you love me.
Don't tell me that.

640
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:25,858
Why don't you look at me?

641
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:29,796
Why don't you fucking look at me?
Look at me!

642
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:31,823
Look at me!

643
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:35,231
Look at me! Stop staring
at the sink! You look at me!

644
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:37,295
You look at me!

645
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:46,537
My God!

646
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:49,976
What happened?

647
00:54:56,693 --> 00:54:57,591
What happened?

648
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:54,107
l never. . .

649
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:57,443
l never told anyone else.

650
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:01,749
l didn't. l never told.

651
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:07,560
l'm sorry.

652
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:17,429
l'll never tell anyone.

653
00:56:23,246 --> 00:56:25,271
Okay, here he is.

654
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:29,477
Look who's here.
Detective Stanford.

655
00:56:29,686 --> 00:56:31,586
He's gonna ask you
some questions.

656
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:33,178
-Hey, Jonathan.
-All right?

657
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:35,124
Okay, Mrs. White.

658
00:56:35,191 --> 00:56:37,293
l'm going to the store.
l'll see you later.

659
00:56:37,293 --> 00:56:38,624
Okay, thanks.

660
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:43,660
Sit down.

661
00:56:44,467 --> 00:56:45,695
Why don't you just sit down?

662
00:56:46,936 --> 00:56:50,428
Your grandmother told me about
your dog. l just heard about it.

663
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:53,067
l'm so sorry.
lt's just awful.

664
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:59,474
Nothing quite as painful
in this world as that.

665
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:03,719
Dog's name was Charlie,
right?

666
00:57:07,724 --> 00:57:10,784
You know, Jonathan,
l don't apologize about things. . .

667
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:17,322
but l have to say l shouldn't have
paraded you around here, like l did.

668
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:21,968
That was, it wasn't right.
You see...

669
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:26,498
when your father died...

670
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:37,012
l had an obligation.
You understand?

671
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:40,146
lt wasn't like we worked
in a department store together...

672
00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:43,648
or a bakery shop or something.
We were partners.

673
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:47,359
And when you're partners,
you're family...

674
00:57:49,265 --> 00:57:52,132
like you are
with your grandmother.

675
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:01,204
l got two dead bodies
on my hands, Jonathan.

676
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:03,109
Now, that's a lot.

677
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:09,447
l got barking dogs,
people looking through peepholes...

678
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:13,717
drug talk about Hanky.
And it's all leading me...

679
00:58:16,459 --> 00:58:17,483
to this.

680
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:18,549
To this.

681
00:58:18,628 --> 00:58:19,492
To this.

682
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:20,686
To this.

683
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:32,706
You know the severity
of which l'm talking about here.

684
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:36,010
l want you to answer me.

685
00:58:41,751 --> 00:58:44,584
These buildings
are full of secrets, Milk.

686
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:48,657
They're full of things people
shouldn't be doing.

687
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:52,395
Mrs. Carter,
up on the sixth floor...

688
00:58:52,395 --> 00:58:55,523
she's telling me Little
Vinny's hearing voices again.

689
00:58:56,733 --> 00:58:58,166
What l'm gonna do with that?

690
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:02,335
l gotta worry about my own.
l can't save the world.

691
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:05,101
This ain't a fucking
Superman outfit l'm wearing.

692
00:59:14,684 --> 00:59:21,954
l've got two worthless pieces of over
21-year-old garbage that are dead.

693
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:24,854
No one cares.

694
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:28,628
Not a single fucking person.

695
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:31,997
So what do l do?

696
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:35,570
Case is closed.

697
00:59:36,706 --> 00:59:37,638
l closed it.

698
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:43,006
So you can go live
your long life.

699
00:59:45,481 --> 00:59:47,312
Next time we meet though...

700
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:50,816
you'll be a man like l am.

701
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:58,987
And a man has to learn
to live with shit.

702
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:13,370
Okay.

703
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,626
l noticed you got a rental.

704
01:00:43,773 --> 01:00:45,741
Come here, we need
to talk. Come on in.

705
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:49,737
Come on.

706
01:00:56,452 --> 01:01:00,445
lt's funny. Whoever's writing
these bullshit letters...

707
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:04,986
seems to be interested in everyone,
except the actual fucking killers.

708
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,297
lt's time this shit stopped. . .

709
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:14,100
don't you think?

710
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:25,313
This next article comes out...

711
01:01:27,216 --> 01:01:28,444
naming names. . .

712
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:31,049
all of us are fucked.

713
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:32,852
But you...

714
01:01:34,924 --> 01:01:36,357
your life's destroyed.

715
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:42,661
Yours and your family's.
Obliterated.

716
01:01:47,236 --> 01:01:48,931
You understand
what l'm saying?

717
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:04,214
This would be
the place for that.

718
01:02:06,289 --> 01:02:09,884
That thing that you're thinking
there, with your gun...

719
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:12,224
you ain't wrong in it.

720
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:17,597
You're just projecting it
on the wrong people.

721
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,202
Sit down, Jonathan.

722
01:02:37,553 --> 01:02:39,544
Let me tell you
something, Jonathan.

723
01:02:40,857 --> 01:02:44,020
All that guilt and hate...

724
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:49,758
and all that other shit you've got
bottled up inside your fucked up head.

725
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:57,035
You've gotta realize what you
gotta do to save your own shit.

726
01:02:59,008 --> 01:03:02,603
l'm worried about a promotion,
simple things.

727
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:09,948
You, this comes out...

728
01:03:10,186 --> 01:03:14,090
l'll see to it that your secret life
is the headline...

729
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:16,354
in the New York
fucking-Times.

730
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:21,327
And that, Milk, that's
what we're talking about now.

731
01:03:55,865 --> 01:03:57,389
Ms. Bridges! Ms Bridges!

732
01:03:58,334 --> 01:03:59,198
Ms. Bridges!

733
01:04:11,581 --> 01:04:14,573
So, brethren have been calling.
l know why you're here.

734
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:17,215
No.
l'm here on my own.

735
01:04:18,487 --> 01:04:20,089
This has nothing
to do with the cops.

736
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:21,757
This has everything to do
with the cops.

737
01:04:21,757 --> 01:04:23,691
-We're just getting a lot of pressure.
-We're?

738
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:24,748
Yes, we're. . .

739
01:04:25,127 --> 01:04:26,629
You love that term
here in America.

740
01:04:26,629 --> 01:04:29,393
Makes you feel like you're
part of something, family.

741
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:35,000
Everything about them
will be over come Saturday.

742
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:54,282
The kind of thing
a newspaper should be breaking.

743
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:04,791
Not a single witness questioned.
Not a single suspect brought in.

744
01:05:05,468 --> 01:05:07,732
How very 1986.

745
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:11,334
This isn't out yet, is it?

746
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:14,235
Saturday
is gonna be a huge day.

747
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:18,075
Marion had me all confused,
and l kept thinking...

748
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:21,550
he could give two damns
about these letters.

749
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:25,987
And he's got plainclothes
following me over some articles?

750
01:05:26,055 --> 01:05:28,250
-Look, all l'm asking is. . .
-All you're asking. . .

751
01:05:28,324 --> 01:05:30,918
is exactly what your captain
sent you here to ask. . .

752
01:05:30,993 --> 01:05:33,291
and l'm not even sure
you know what that is.

753
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:36,595
Okay.

754
01:05:42,738 --> 01:05:43,739
lf this were a movie. . .

755
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:46,572
l'd say you looked like
you saw a ghost, Mr. White.

756
01:05:48,978 --> 01:05:50,343
Look, you can't print this.

757
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:56,480
-Why wouldn't l?
-Please, sit down.

758
01:05:56,819 --> 01:05:57,683
Why wouldn't l. . .

759
01:05:59,555 --> 01:06:00,283
Please just.

760
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:07,897
Can you give me a week?
Give me a week.

761
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:11,067
Two murdered nobodies
from the projects you grew up in...

762
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:15,060
are about to finally get the justice
they deserve after all these years.

763
01:06:15,438 --> 01:06:16,962
-You're not, you're not hearing me.
-Nothing's gonna change that.

764
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:19,667
You're not hearing me.
Can you please. . .

765
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:25,205
Ms. Bridges, just hold
one second. Just hold...

766
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:29,646
One second.
Just hold on, please!

767
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:32,989
Bridges, please...

768
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:36,322
-You can give me one week?
-Your father is dead, Mr. White.

769
01:06:36,392 --> 01:06:38,327
l'm not sorry,
because l didn't know him...

770
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:40,029
but his partner's an old
man now, a dirty old man. . .

771
01:06:40,029 --> 01:06:42,657
full of dirty old man secrets...

772
01:06:42,732 --> 01:06:44,461
l get to fuck his legacy. . .

773
01:06:44,533 --> 01:06:45,932
and Mathers' future
in one shot.

774
01:06:46,202 --> 01:06:47,567
Gives me great delight.

775
01:07:45,694 --> 01:07:46,490
Hey, Vinny.

776
01:08:07,616 --> 01:08:09,345
You got something
you wanna say to me?

777
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:22,890
You wanna talk to me?

778
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:26,096
You wanna talk to me about
these letters you been writing?

779
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:45,988
l remember when you
caught me up here. . .

780
01:08:45,988 --> 01:08:47,421
on the roof
with my mother's boyfriend.

781
01:08:49,492 --> 01:08:51,050
You never told nobody.

782
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:55,123
Why you never told nobody?

783
01:09:02,004 --> 01:09:06,100
'Cause you was my friend?
Are you still my friend?

784
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:17,745
When the pressures
and things started to happen...

785
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:25,156
you was the only one that came
to see me in the hospital.

786
01:09:26,896 --> 01:09:29,364
They made me drink
all that stuff.

787
01:09:30,699 --> 01:09:35,159
Couldn't say my words right.
Couldn't talk.

788
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:40,475
But you did talk.

789
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:45,847
-l tried to say it.
-But you did talk.

790
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:48,376
You did talk.

791
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,846
You said that you weren't gonna
say nothing to nobody.

792
01:09:55,891 --> 01:09:58,792
But you fucked both of our
lives up in this shit, man.

793
01:10:02,264 --> 01:10:03,959
You said you weren't
gonna tell nobody.

794
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:10,965
l think l'm gonna go.

795
01:10:14,009 --> 01:10:15,476
l knew you would do good.

796
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:21,880
l think l'm gonna go.

797
01:10:25,187 --> 01:10:26,449
You're gonna be fine.

798
01:11:10,366 --> 01:11:10,957
Hello?

799
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:14,430
Do l need to talk to your
wife to get this done?

800
01:11:14,536 --> 01:11:17,130
-What?
-ls that l'm gonna have to do?

801
01:11:18,173 --> 01:11:19,697
Kerry, you know
where my gun is?

802
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:20,207
What?

803
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:22,176
-You know where my gun is.
-l'm calling the cops, Johnny.

804
01:11:22,244 --> 01:11:24,838
You're on with a fucking cop!
l'm on my way.

805
01:11:52,941 --> 01:11:53,771
l don't know.

806
01:11:56,545 --> 01:11:57,409
You don't know.

807
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:01,708
No.

808
01:12:04,086 --> 01:12:06,077
You don't know why people
are calling about a murder...

809
01:12:06,522 --> 01:12:09,616
or why your car was totaled
or what's going on?

810
01:12:09,692 --> 01:12:13,526
Because eventually you're gonna have
to know something, Jonathan. You are.

811
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:16,565
You are.
l am talking to you!

812
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:18,590
Please, just don't
touch me right now.

813
01:12:22,604 --> 01:12:24,435
l just wanted to give us
a normal life.

814
01:12:25,641 --> 01:12:30,340
l just wanted to give us
a normal life.

815
01:12:30,713 --> 01:12:32,340
-He said it's all.
-What does that mean?

816
01:12:37,619 --> 01:12:39,519
lt means l don't know
what to do about this.

817
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:43,616
l have no idea
what to do about this.

818
01:12:45,627 --> 01:12:47,060
lt comes out next week.

819
01:12:52,134 --> 01:12:53,795
l killed those people, Ker.

820
01:13:00,776 --> 01:13:02,801
l killed the people those
letters are talking about.

821
01:13:05,914 --> 01:13:07,438
l killed both of those people.

822
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:15,921
Charlie? Shit. Charlie!

823
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:19,922
Char. . .

824
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:25,561
lt's okay. lt's okay.

825
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:28,666
Okay, darling.

826
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:31,262
-l'll the ambulance.
-She's fine. Let her sleep it off.

827
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:36,977
lt's okay, it's okay.
lt's okay, sweetie. lt's okay.

828
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:40,541
Mama's here.
Mama's here.

829
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:42,448
Mama's here.

830
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:44,984
Mama's here.

831
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:05,070
So as it's coming in last night
at approximately 7:45 local...

832
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:08,405
writer and columnist for The Queens
Gazette, Lauren Bridges...

833
01:14:08,477 --> 01:14:10,411
was gunned down
execution style...

834
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:14,446
at the foot of her office
on 31st Street in Astoria, Queens.

835
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:15,539
Witnesses say...

836
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:18,916
one man in a black ski mask
was last seen running right here...

837
01:14:19,388 --> 01:14:20,286
Oh, my God.

838
01:14:23,225 --> 01:14:24,624
That's the woman
from the paper.

839
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:28,218
She was killed, Jonathan.

840
01:14:35,003 --> 01:14:37,767
-Hello?
-Prudenti's outside.

841
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:40,699
You'll take a drive.

842
01:14:40,776 --> 01:14:43,870
You fuck with my family, l swear
l'll kill you. l don't care who you are.

843
01:14:44,112 --> 01:14:47,775
You're watching the news right now.
You know how serious l am.

844
01:14:48,383 --> 01:14:52,012
Now get in his fucking car
and go.

845
01:15:04,233 --> 01:15:05,325
l'm taking my own car.

846
01:15:07,703 --> 01:15:08,362
You got it.

847
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:32,353
lt's fucked up
about that dyke.

848
01:15:34,997 --> 01:15:35,827
Fuck her though.

849
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:09,423
Let's swing it right there.

850
01:16:15,604 --> 01:16:17,435
-Where?
-Pull up.

851
01:16:20,776 --> 01:16:22,869
All right. Here.

852
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:55,773
Go ahead.

853
01:17:09,091 --> 01:17:09,819
Come on in.

854
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:32,113
-Fuck you want from me?
-Okay. Come on.

855
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:38,881
Have a seat over here.

856
01:17:43,225 --> 01:17:45,921
Tommy, close the door.
Come on. Sit down.

857
01:17:56,738 --> 01:18:01,072
All right, how about l sit
first. Have a seat.

858
01:18:13,955 --> 01:18:16,947
Love fades. Did you ever
hear that expression?

859
01:18:18,827 --> 01:18:19,919
Less than a year ago. . .

860
01:18:19,995 --> 01:18:22,725
we lost almost 400 fellow,
officers and firemen...

861
01:18:22,964 --> 01:18:25,660
and people are already getting
tired of saying thank you.

862
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:27,726
lt's a tough city.

863
01:18:28,904 --> 01:18:32,465
These are photographs of you
and Lauren Bridges at Mike's Diner. . .

864
01:18:32,641 --> 01:18:33,767
seven p.m...

865
01:18:34,576 --> 01:18:37,909
the night that she
was murdered. Last night.

866
01:18:39,514 --> 01:18:42,642
Those pictures could cause you
a lot of problems, l imagine.

867
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:45,544
-You killed her.
-Jonathan. . .

868
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:49,024
-Sit down.
-Easy. Go easy.

869
01:18:49,024 --> 01:18:51,492
Thomas put it away.

870
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:54,529
-Put it away now.
-That's okay. Just go sit over there.

871
01:18:54,529 --> 01:18:56,053
-What's going on?
-Everything's okay.

872
01:18:57,566 --> 01:19:00,831
Just do what he says.
Just relax.

873
01:19:00,902 --> 01:19:03,564
Jonathan,
you don't recognize me?

874
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:08,876
-Yeah, l recognize you.
-That's good.

875
01:19:09,845 --> 01:19:11,676
l'm glad to hear that.
Sit down.

876
01:19:14,149 --> 01:19:15,582
Sit.
We're gonna talk.

877
01:19:15,717 --> 01:19:18,277
You have to excuse
my godson Marion.

878
01:19:18,353 --> 01:19:21,811
He has a tendency
to draw things out.

879
01:19:27,229 --> 01:19:29,789
Last l saw you,
you were a boy.

880
01:19:30,031 --> 01:19:31,726
l was a man.

881
01:19:32,567 --> 01:19:34,592
Look at me now.

882
01:19:39,674 --> 01:19:43,508
Jonathan, shouldn't be
concerned about this.

883
01:19:45,013 --> 01:19:48,016
This is family matters,
it's between all of us.

884
01:19:48,016 --> 01:19:52,282
You're here because, in 1986.
you and your friend Vincent Carter...

885
01:19:52,354 --> 01:19:55,056
killed the two men referred
to in this bitch's articles.

886
01:19:55,056 --> 01:19:56,148
They were no good.

887
01:19:57,425 --> 01:19:58,693
This is a family, Jonathan...

888
01:19:58,693 --> 01:20:01,161
that you passed your civil
service test to rejoin.

889
01:20:01,229 --> 01:20:03,322
Listen, l knew
your godfather.

890
01:20:03,398 --> 01:20:05,593
No, l know you did.
He was your dad's partner.

891
01:20:05,867 --> 01:20:08,097
And, as you can see now,
he's an old man.

892
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:10,400
Stop talking about me
like l was not here.

893
01:20:10,739 --> 01:20:14,175
Stop talking about me like
l'm not in the fucking room!

894
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:20,982
After all these years,
none of us were gonna allow. . .

895
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:23,348
the good names
of our family to go down. . .

896
01:20:23,518 --> 01:20:27,887
because he did what was right
for two ungrateful punk murderers...

897
01:20:28,623 --> 01:20:30,853
especially on the verge
of his retirement.

898
01:20:30,926 --> 01:20:33,656
-You mean on your inauguration?
-l did what l had to do.

899
01:20:33,929 --> 01:20:36,261
l did it for you and l did it
for your father.

900
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:38,595
That's who l did it for.
l had to do it.

901
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:41,830
Bridges first told me about
the letters, l could give a shit.

902
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:44,306
-But then they just kept on coming.
-They just kept coming.

903
01:20:44,306 --> 01:20:47,275
We knew it either had to be you
or that other piece of garbage.

904
01:20:47,275 --> 01:20:50,267
-But it didn't make any sense to us.
-That's right.

905
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:51,573
You'd gotten away with it.

906
01:20:51,746 --> 01:20:54,579
So we figured you were just
suffering from a guilty conscience.

907
01:20:54,649 --> 01:20:57,709
-We thought you were a fucking moron.
-So we brought you back.

908
01:20:57,786 --> 01:21:00,155
Turns out you didn't have
any conscience at all.

909
01:21:00,155 --> 01:21:04,387
All the while it was your brain-damaged
friend with the desire to talk...

910
01:21:04,759 --> 01:21:08,063
to confess,
to write the letters...

911
01:21:08,063 --> 01:21:10,165
to be a fucking retard.

912
01:21:10,165 --> 01:21:11,928
But you were a good kid,
Jonathan.

913
01:21:12,167 --> 01:21:16,900
So, let us take care of this here.
Let us do it.

914
01:21:16,972 --> 01:21:19,736
-l've got a family.
-Of course you got a family.

915
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:23,701
This is what you've gotta do.

916
01:21:24,679 --> 01:21:26,772
-Listen to him.
-He's listening.

917
01:21:26,848 --> 01:21:28,213
Just listen to him, Jonathan.

918
01:21:29,117 --> 01:21:31,017
You're gonna get back
in your car now...

919
01:21:31,853 --> 01:21:34,549
and you're gonna drive
home to your daughter, Charlotte.

920
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:40,362
And, on that long drive home, you're
gonna think about her pretty face...

921
01:21:40,362 --> 01:21:45,129
your beautiful wife, and your nice
life out there on the island.

922
01:21:45,767 --> 01:21:49,828
And after you get there, you're
gonna think how lucky you are...

923
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:52,772
to have half the 1 18
working overtime...

924
01:21:53,141 --> 01:21:55,405
to ensure
that nobody finds out...

925
01:21:55,610 --> 01:21:58,841
that you're a cold-blooded killer.

926
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:02,543
-l'm not no murderer.
-You're a murderer, Jonathan.

927
01:22:03,051 --> 01:22:06,043
Jonathan, you get back here,
it'll be like it never happened.

928
01:22:06,121 --> 01:22:07,889
You'll get a transfer
back to the land. . .

929
01:22:07,889 --> 01:22:10,323
where DUls
are your biggest concern.

930
01:22:11,326 --> 01:22:14,763
Here in Queens, they'll be
a tiny blurb in a little paper...

931
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:16,196
about a crazed fan. . .

932
01:22:16,364 --> 01:22:18,491
who wrote letters
to a lonely woman.

933
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:23,731
Killed her and then
he takes his own life.

934
01:22:25,507 --> 01:22:27,304
And life will go on.

935
01:22:28,143 --> 01:22:30,304
The life you never
dreamed you'd have.

936
01:22:32,113 --> 01:22:32,807
Got it?

937
01:22:33,982 --> 01:22:35,677
-lt's gonna be okay then.
-Good.

938
01:22:36,918 --> 01:22:38,385
lt'll be okay, Jonathan.

939
01:22:40,155 --> 01:22:40,814
Go.

940
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:43,889
You're okay, Jonathan.

941
01:23:28,203 --> 01:23:31,639
Here in Queens, there'll be
a tiny blurb in a little paper...

942
01:23:31,706 --> 01:23:33,071
about a crazed fan...

943
01:23:33,174 --> 01:23:35,335
who wrote letters
to a lonely woman.

944
01:23:40,749 --> 01:23:41,807
He killed her...

945
01:23:44,352 --> 01:23:46,149
and then,
he takes his own life.

946
01:23:47,989 --> 01:23:51,720
You're the, only fucking person
in this whole world l can trust, Milk.

947
01:23:52,327 --> 01:23:52,994
l hate it here.

948
01:23:52,994 --> 01:23:54,757
l hate it here
so fucking much.

949
01:23:59,200 --> 01:23:59,825
Vinny?

950
01:24:00,402 --> 01:24:02,461
l never told.
Never.

951
01:24:14,115 --> 01:24:17,278
Whatever you and your
little friend did, Milk...

952
01:24:19,988 --> 01:24:21,546
whatever it was...

953
01:24:23,491 --> 01:24:25,049
l could give two shits.

954
01:24:27,862 --> 01:24:29,921
You're gonna have
to learn to deal with it...

955
01:24:31,466 --> 01:24:32,433
live with it...

956
01:24:34,769 --> 01:24:35,997
however you do.

957
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:39,470
Remember...

958
01:24:42,844 --> 01:24:44,778
this is the last time we meet...

959
01:24:47,549 --> 01:24:49,039
as man and child.

960
01:24:50,385 --> 01:24:50,976
Vinny?

961
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:52,743
Shit!

962
01:24:56,458 --> 01:24:57,516
And a man...

963
01:25:00,195 --> 01:25:01,457
has to learn...

964
01:25:03,398 --> 01:25:04,228
to live...

965
01:25:08,636 --> 01:25:09,694
with shit.

966
01:25:10,305 --> 01:25:10,862
Vinny!

967
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:18,379
No, no! Jonathan!

968
01:25:18,379 --> 01:25:19,647
Stupid motherfucker!
Jonathan.

969
01:25:19,647 --> 01:25:21,783
-We told you to go home!
-Get a hold of yourself!

970
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:22,772
You, come here.

971
01:25:23,017 --> 01:25:24,352
Come here! Retard!

972
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:25,410
Stop!

973
01:25:25,587 --> 01:25:26,884
Get a hold of yourself!

974
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:27,444
Get the fuck off me!

975
01:25:27,622 --> 01:25:28,690
Back the fuck off.

976
01:25:28,690 --> 01:25:29,748
You gonna shoot me now?

977
01:25:30,091 --> 01:25:31,683
Back the fuck off.

978
01:25:32,494 --> 01:25:35,292
-He didn't kill nobody!
-You stay the fuck down!

979
01:25:35,530 --> 01:25:36,997
Stay down!

980
01:25:37,398 --> 01:25:38,666
He ruined your life!

981
01:25:38,666 --> 01:25:41,897
Now, you're gonna take this gun and
you're gonna shoot him in his head.

982
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:45,030
Stay fucking down!

983
01:25:45,373 --> 01:25:47,568
Take his fucking gun and shoot him!
Shut the fuck up!

984
01:25:47,642 --> 01:25:49,405
He ruined your life.
Do you hear me?

985
01:25:49,577 --> 01:25:51,913
He ruined your fucking life.

986
01:25:51,913 --> 01:25:54,582
-He didn't kill anybody!
-You both did! Forget it!

987
01:25:54,582 --> 01:25:55,378
Shoot him!

988
01:26:01,322 --> 01:26:02,289
My God.

989
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:05,819
No!

990
01:26:08,496 --> 01:26:09,292
Vin!

991
01:26:33,321 --> 01:26:35,380
Another step, l end it.

992
01:26:37,058 --> 01:26:37,888
l end it.

993
01:26:44,532 --> 01:26:47,763
You go now.
You keep going.

994
01:26:50,972 --> 01:26:52,462
You go, you keep going.

995
01:26:53,641 --> 01:26:56,906
Keep going. Let him go.
Let him go!

996
01:26:58,046 --> 01:27:01,812
You can hate me
all you want, Jonathan!

997
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:03,610
All you want!

998
01:27:04,452 --> 01:27:06,420
But you're a free man now!

999
01:27:07,822 --> 01:27:09,221
You're a free man!

1000
01:27:28,643 --> 01:27:29,200
Milk.

1001
01:27:32,513 --> 01:27:33,207
Milk...

1002
01:27:37,485 --> 01:27:40,283
-Never told nobody.
-l know, l know.

1003
01:27:41,589 --> 01:27:43,250
Never told nobody.

1004
01:27:45,426 --> 01:27:46,290
l'm sorry.

1005
01:27:47,195 --> 01:27:51,461
-lt's okay. lt's okay, Vinny.
-Milk. . .

1006
01:28:10,918 --> 01:28:12,215
Jonathan White.

1007
01:28:16,324 --> 01:28:18,224
l never meant for this to hurt you.

1008
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:21,060
Or Vinny.

1009
01:28:22,897 --> 01:28:23,829
Or anyone.

1010
01:28:26,567 --> 01:28:28,057
lt was always them.

1011
01:28:31,939 --> 01:28:35,136
ln the end, we matter.

1012
01:28:38,279 --> 01:28:43,012
And now, one of them is
dead and the other...

1013
01:28:45,787 --> 01:28:48,551
No one cares about a foolish old man.

1014
01:28:51,626 --> 01:28:53,093
Funny how things work out.

1015
01:28:58,499 --> 01:29:00,023
This will be my last letter.

1016
01:29:02,303 --> 01:29:03,702
Go live your life.

1017
01:29:06,007 --> 01:29:07,372
You're free to do that.

1018
01:29:09,777 --> 01:29:10,801
Free to forget.

1019
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:13,608
Vicky.
