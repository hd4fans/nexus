1
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,752
We have to choose for everything in the world.

2
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,877
Like love, if it's meant to be fading away.

3
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,674
The only thing you can do is to forget about her.

4
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,558
Or to make her forget about you.

5
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,548
I am a demon hunter.

6
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,676
One day, my master told me
to catch a demon in the mountain.

7
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,355
Then I know...

8
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,868
my master wanted to train my heart

9
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,709
instead of my skill.

10
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,711
'Cos the most horrible thing
for a demon is not killing,

11
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,279
but one would be

12
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,788
Iosing himself.

13
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,111
My name is Siu Sin, and you?

14
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,629
Yin Chek Ha.

15
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,477
It's yummy, what's this?

16
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,510
Candy.

17
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,354
I wanna have it for the rest of my life.

18
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,552
I just can't afford that.

19
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,798
I would love the one who gives me this.

20
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,600
Human and demon can't be together?

21
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,995
Then you'd better kill me,

22
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,630
come on!

23
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,789
From now on,

24
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,798
you won't get pain.

25
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,798
Because you won't remember me.

26
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,598
Yin Chek Ha, use your last mighty
weapon to stab her to death!

27
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,309
Chop off my hand to suppress her as mighty weapon.

28
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,916
Hurry!

29
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,352
The day I break through the charm

30
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,033
would be the end of the demon hunters!

31
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,519
It's all right for losing one hand.

32
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,557
I lost 3 buddies...

33
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,029
Yin Chek Ha...

34
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,672
don't call yourself a demon hunter.

35
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,469
I finally understand human
and demon can't be together.

36
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,119
I decided to use the only weapon

37
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,078
to seal up her memory about me.

38
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,111
Then she would forget the love between us

39
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,879
and she would forget about me forever.

40
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,068
However,

41
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,909
as that young man went up to Black Mountain,

42
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,079
everything about Siu Sin
and I would restart again.

43
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,752
What the hell are you doing? Stealing water?

44
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,950
No...

45
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,995
No?

46
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,509
Take him back!

47
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,238
And his stuff too!

48
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,036
Chyun Cheung,

49
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,189
these tools are so weird,

50
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,394
dunno what they are for.

51
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,232
With so many weird tools,

52
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,110
he's coming for our water.

53
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,789
Chop off his hands.

54
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,599
What do think you are doing?

55
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,439
You guys are absolutely lawless!

56
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,593
I am an officer...

57
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,437
Chyun Cheung...

58
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,076
Chyun Cheung...he...

59
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,275
Ti Nga, why are you here?

60
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,073
No...he...

61
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,870
What's your name?

62
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,316
My name is Ning Choi San

63
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,595
Ning Choi San?

64
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,115
Our Black Mountain Village is famous

65
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,838
for making pottery.

66
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,319
But we don't have water now,

67
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,555
and you could only see those left over.

68
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,680
Those kilns have fallen into disuse for long.

69
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,839
We couldn't raise our livestock here.

70
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,875
Now, the most important thing
is to find the water source.

71
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,075
Yes, we did send many letters
to the county officer

72
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,912
and begging them for our rescue.

73
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,990
As you are here now,

74
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,516
you are our savior.

75
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,795
Don't say that... Don't say that...

76
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,633
I'm just a craftsman.

77
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,949
Just call me Ning Choi San.

78
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,511
You are from the government office,
you must be the officer.

79
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,914
Yeas, Mr. Ning.

80
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,674
It's been hung all over,

81
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,716
what for?

82
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,796
It's charm, to drive away demons.

83
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,272
We use it in begging for rain.

84
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,195
Begging for rain.

85
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,031
Come on, everybody...

86
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,639
Iook...

87
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,268
- Mr. Ning is our savior.
- Don't say that

88
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,075
Everybody, I, Ning Choi San, promised that

89
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,631
I will find the water source
in the mountain later.

90
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,191
Otherwise, I will never come back.

91
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,635
Great!...

92
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,150
Quiet!

93
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,948
Sir, everyone in this village
would like to thank you.

94
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,359
But I do need your help.

95
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,909
Go ahead!

96
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,838
In finding water source, I couldn't do it alone.

97
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,070
I need some strong guys...

98
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,639
to come with me to the mountain.

99
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,313
Mountain?

100
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,790
What's the problem?

101
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,440
As long as you go, that would be all right.

102
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,149
No need, just go back.

103
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,676
Mr. Ning, wait...

104
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,512
My name is Ti Nga.

105
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,399
I go with you.

106
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,796
That's good.

107
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,916
Why are they being shackled?

108
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,277
They are all criminals.

109
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,393
Chyun Cheung gave them chance
to make up for their sins.

110
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,229
Mr. Ning,

111
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,194
when I was small...I used to go up to the mountain

112
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,591
with my father and brother.

113
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,190
I take this path very often.

114
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,119
But if we don't make any marks...

115
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,438
we would get lost easily.

116
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,996
You...wait.

117
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,950
Yes.

118
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,278
If you don't lead the way,
I will get lost for sure.

119
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,676
Don't panic, as I am here...

120
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,354
we won't get lost.

121
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,796
- Let's go...
- Go...

122
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,436
Be careful...

123
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,434
Don't fall off...

124
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,519
My leg...

125
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,949
As we go on like this, we would be crippled...

126
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,996
before we find the water source.

127
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,998
How could you go up to the mountain
for being so fussy?

128
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,390
We'd better unshackle them.

129
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,469
It'd be better for them to walk.

130
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,232
No way.

131
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,753
They just committed small crime,

132
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,194
they shouldn't be punished like this.

133
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,155
What do you mean?

134
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,510
They are all murderers.

135
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,189
Murderers?

136
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,439
If they are not,

137
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,353
who would go with you?

138
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,869
It's fine, just be careful.

139
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,032
In fact, you'd better watch out for

140
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,189
those on the mountain...

141
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,029
What?

142
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,952
Nothing...be careful.

143
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,189
Watch out.

144
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,519
Mr. Ning,

145
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,591
Iook...

146
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,150
Keep digging.

147
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,995
Go ahead.

148
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,198
Look, there have been dead branches
all over as we go along.

149
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,595
But there are fresh plants and flowers here.

150
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,756
We'd have water here.

151
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:22,798
Right.

152
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,234
We will find the water source very soon.

153
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,799
That's good.

154
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,188
Keep an eye on them.

155
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,236
Don't worry.

156
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,992
Hey...do not slacken.

157
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,274
Candy for you.

158
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,234
Mr. Ning!

159
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,950
Why is the sky so weird?

160
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,316
Dunno.

161
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,239
Let's go down. It's getting dark,
why should we stay here?

162
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,908
Don't be silly, it would be worse for going down.

163
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,269
Any where we can stay?

164
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,033
There's a temple right ahead.

165
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,271
Let's pack them up, let's go, hurry.

166
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,993
Hurry

167
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,950
Hurry...

168
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,312
You go ahead, I will pack.

169
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,268
Move it.

170
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,592
Water!

171
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,552
There's water ahead...

172
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,314
Water!

173
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,515
Water...

174
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,509
Help me.

175
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,669
It's water...

176
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,349
Can we drink?

177
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,589
What's this?

178
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,519
I'd like to check the depth.

179
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,116
Maybe it's the water source we are looking for.

180
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,715
Great!

181
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,714
You are doing well today.

182
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,356
Where are they?

183
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,470
I will look for them...don't let them run.

184
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,833
What are you afraid of? Am I ugly?

185
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,955
No.

186
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,431
Miss, what are you doing?

187
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,430
I am doing what you guys love to do.

188
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,240
Miss, stop that, you can't do that...

189
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,517
Lou Lou told us we have to
be passionate to our guests.

190
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,515
Don't you like it?

191
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,834
No...I haven't...

192
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,316
I got it.

193
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,273
You haven't done that and it doesn't mean
that you don't like it.

194
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,594
You will like it.

195
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,318
Miss, no...no...

196
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,515
You are so naughty.

197
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,556
Sorry...

198
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,429
What's this?

199
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,829
What?

200
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,198
It's old jade, it can drive away the demon.

201
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,514
Let me see that.

202
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:27,917
Here.

203
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,190
Take it off.

204
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,630
Here.

205
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,195
No matter how much you eat,

206
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,636
I will beat you up!

207
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,833
Hey...

208
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,714
You scare the hell us out.

209
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,828
Just an old jade,

210
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,076
do you have to do that?

211
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,759
You look so miserable, it's from your lover?

212
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,434
It's the only thing that mom
left me before she died.

213
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,555
Hey, look at me.

214
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,834
You don't wanna look at me

215
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,076
that means you are blaming me
for breaking your jade?

216
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,669
I didn't.

217
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,399
Mr. Ning, it's awful...

218
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,959
They all got killed by the demon...

219
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,909
Ti Nga!

220
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,472
Murder! Run! Miss!

221
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,510
Run!

222
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,111
Hocus Pocus!

223
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,949
I will get you next time.

224
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,398
That Taoist is so powerful.

225
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,675
I'm not afraid of him.

226
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,030
Don't go that way.

227
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:14,917
This way.

228
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,630
Why are you back?

229
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,915
I just told you.

230
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,670
What?

231
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,149
Beard is around.

232
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,836
Follow me.

233
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,829
He will be back.

234
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,030
Sit down.

235
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,754
Black Mountain is such a weird place.

236
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,553
Are we gonna sit here and do nothing?

237
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,235
What?

238
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,110
Strange.

239
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,952
Why is it no smell?

240
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,670
What smell?

241
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,315
He's also a nice guy.

242
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,475
Forget it.

243
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,114
Miss.

244
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,670
What?

245
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,398
That psychotic killer might still be around.

246
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,069
Don't bump into him.

247
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,315
Let's wait for a bit, it's safe here.

248
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,713
You really scare of dying.

249
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,035
What's your name?

250
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,750
Ning Choi San

251
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,756
My name is Siu Sin

252
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,950
Here.

253
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,315
What's this?

254
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,833
Candy, it's nice.

255
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,396
You like it?

256
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,110
It's all yours.

257
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,153
Well... Am I gonna have the chance

258
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,759
to treat you candy again?

259
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,155
It's exhausted for running all night.

260
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,155
Wake me up at dawn.

261
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,717
Mighty eyes!

262
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,670
Go!

263
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,476
Look!

264
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,156
Yin Chek Ha, men and demons
would have their own ways.

265
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,271
Why are you always after me?

266
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,230
Shit!

267
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,873
You think you will be able to feed yourself?

268
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,030
Go to hell!

269
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:36,996
As I am out of here...

270
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,117
You are not gonna come out, geek!

271
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,475
Hey!

272
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,838
Why are you always scaring me on my back?

273
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,196
You are brave enough to go back
to Lan York Tze alone,

274
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,236
will you be scared by me?

275
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,351
What did you put in the water?

276
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,430
Torpedo.

277
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,030
Torpedo?

278
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,076
Don't pull!

279
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,189
Or it will explode!

280
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,195
Really!

281
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,548
If I guess it right,

282
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,033
water will be emerged from the leak.

283
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,920
Then the water will go to Black Mountain Village.

284
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,310
Ning Choi San, no matter what happens,
don't make a sound.

285
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,153
Just pretend you see nothing, okay?

286
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,036
Why?

287
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,436
If you wan to leave Lan York Tze alive,
just do as I said.

288
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,112
Why are we getting along so well?

289
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,829
Of course. 'Cos we both hate the same person...

290
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,194
Siu Sin!

291
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,070
No wonder Lou Lou likes Siu Sin so much.

292
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,437
Look, she already got her prey.

293
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,352
Siu Sin, what should we do later on?

294
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,069
You are late,

295
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,629
he's mine.

296
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,318
Why is he still alive?

297
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,594
Dare you mess with me?

298
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,992
What are you laughing at?
Lou Lou is complaining about you

299
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,674
for not finding good stuff for her.

300
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,069
She told me to punish you.

301
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,039
Why are you still standing here? Move it!

302
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,599
Bring some good stuff for her.

303
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,395
Ning Choi San, run!

304
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,988
They will kill you!

305
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,959
Lied to us?

306
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,750
Siu Sin

307
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,075
Siu Sin

308
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:22,712
Siu Sin

309
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,713
Siu Sin...

310
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,676
Why you came here?

311
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,670
Run!

312
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,753
Let go...Iet go of me.

313
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,076
I don't wanna know who you are,
I don't care whether you would die or not.

314
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,389
You just can't stay at Black Mountain..

315
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,710
If that old demon eats you,

316
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:48,756
she will be so powerful...

317
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,075
then I will be in trouble.

318
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,791
- Let go of me...
- Run

319
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,356
Don't move if you want to live.

320
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,310
Where is he?

321
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,236
Who?

322
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,549
His name is Ning Choi San.

323
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,749
He got eaten by you.

324
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:39,836
Did you forget?

325
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,874
Why you have to save me?

326
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,837
I am gonna kill you if you try to harm anyone.

327
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,673
I know you are a demon hunter,

328
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,593
you won't let me go.

329
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,159
Thanks for saving me...

330
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,274
Thank you so much, I won't forget about you.

331
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,355
You'd better forget about me.

332
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,318
I told you not to move.

333
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,352
You won't kill me.

334
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,913
Are you sure?

335
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,309
Your situation is more dangerous than mine.

336
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,230
Why?

337
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,349
I won't kill you though.

338
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,349
Beard,

339
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,796
comfy?

340
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,711
Why you tied him up with one leg only?

341
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,911
Don't you think he looks cute like this?

342
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,670
Go.

343
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,750
Sorry.

344
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,275
Well, I used to say you are afraid of death.

345
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,630
Really?

346
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,874
In fact, you are not.

347
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,439
Otherwise, you won't come for my rescue.

348
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,513
In fact... I really do.

349
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,955
Why did you come back then?

350
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,639
What are you gonna do?

351
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,759
I decided to go downhill.

352
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,875
Downhill?

353
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,989
You still have candy?

354
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,515
Yes.

355
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,309
Siu Sin, you come with me.

356
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,391
I already found the water source,

357
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,879
I could show you.

358
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,831
- Are you sure?
- Yes

359
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,638
You know it's huge outside.

360
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,159
Much bigger than Black Mountain.

361
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,396
And there are different candies

362
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,471
and interesting things.

363
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,749
Do you wanna come with me?

364
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,397
Siu Sin.

365
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,388
Siu Sin...

366
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,392
I am hungry,

367
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,516
bring me that chap.

368
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,710
What is it?

369
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,870
It's getting dark soon.

370
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,397
Follow me, come on.

371
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,509
Why are you running so fast?

372
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,557
Hurry!

373
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,472
Siu Sin...

374
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,473
I am hungry...

375
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,797
Bring me that chap.

376
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,912
Siu Sin...

377
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:08,910
Come on

378
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,799
Going downhill, why are you running so fast?

379
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:12,950
Come with me!

380
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,029
Where are you going?

381
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,158
Siu Sin...Siu Sin...I am hugry...

382
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,753
Siu Sin, why are you running so fast?

383
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,672
- It's so windy.
- Don't ask.

384
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,632
I am hungry...

385
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,716
Bring me that chap.

386
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,552
Back!

387
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,069
What are you doing?

388
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,117
I...

389
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,638
I just wanna give you candy.

390
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,432
Just candy?

391
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,868
Who do you think I am?

392
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,029
Please believe me.

393
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,839
Run! Hurry up!

394
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,911
Didn't we get along so well just now?

395
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,874
You'd better go!

396
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,078
- You...
- What the hell!

397
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,556
Why you keep changing your mind?

398
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,596
So I am.

399
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,473
- You go away.
- I won't

400
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,432
You go away.

401
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,834
I am hungry!

402
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,559
Bring me that chap!

403
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,151
Siu Sin...

404
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,918
Dare you disobey what Lou Lou said.

405
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,636
Hey...

406
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,951
Hey... Chyun Cheung! Mr. Ning is back!

407
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,678
I told you, Mr. Ning won't die so soon.

408
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,630
Mr. Ning

409
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,468
Thank you, we finally got water for the village.

410
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,277
Really?

411
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,958
They should be happy about that.

412
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,513
But they shouldn't waste too much water.

413
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,517
Don't waste water...

414
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,512
And those who go with me...

415
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,277
are still missing.

416
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,839
They deserve to die.

417
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,676
Well.

418
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,035
Sacrifice can't be avoided sometimes.

419
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,113
Forget about those unpleasant things.

420
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,874
Hey...

421
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,036
Ti Nga?

422
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,199
Ti Nga, are you all right?

423
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,515
Sir...he and that demon...

424
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,715
Demon the hell!

425
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,878
Look at you, you are so dirty, go have a shower.

426
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,996
There is water in Black Mountain Village, go...

427
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,114
No...he and that demon...

428
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,475
Mr. Ning is right.

429
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,433
We have to be considerate.

430
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,079
We shouldn't waste.

431
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,152
Today, the celebration should end at dawn.

432
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,192
Come on, splash him.

433
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,232
Say it!

434
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,719
Why did you let him go?

435
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,115
Lou Lou...

436
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,678
I will find you a better one.

437
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,199
You like him?

438
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,948
I just don't want to hurt him.

439
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:18,479
Lou Lou, you told me that the main
difference between men and demons is

440
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,710
demons can do whatever they want to.

441
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,314
Did I say that?

442
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,915
I did.

443
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:38,639
For what I said here,

444
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,792
just listen to it and don't try to use it.

445
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,797
Here, in Lan York Tze,

446
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,434
In Lan York Tze there's only one boss

447
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,872
that's me.

448
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:59,871
You will never get reincarnated.

449
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,158
Just serve me well.

450
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,111
Cheer up! Let's drink!

451
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:17,555
Sir, I...want to have a drink with you.

452
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,956
Chyun Cheung, I have drunk too much.

453
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,435
Right, she's my niece.

454
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,675
- Hello.
- Have a seat.

455
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,955
Say hello to Mr. Ning.

456
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,992
Drink with our savior, Mr. Ning.

457
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,233
- Mr. Ning, cheers.
- No need...

458
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:31,997
I can't drink anymore.

459
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,388
Bottoms up.

460
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,155
Very good.

461
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,071
Mr. Ning, it's good stuff.

462
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,478
- No... I can do it.
- Let me do it.

463
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,716
Enjoy it.

464
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,912
Do serve master well.

465
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,239
Mr. Ning, what are you looking at?

466
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,150
Nothing.

467
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,755
Have some.

468
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,312
Do you know what I want to eat now?

469
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:18,830
Candy.

470
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,035
Alright, I will get some for you.

471
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,230
No need.

472
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,236
I go...

473
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,110
I go by myself.

474
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,189
Where are you going?

475
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,349
Washroom.

476
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,031
Go to washroom for candy?

477
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,235
Siu Sin

478
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,915
Siu Sin

479
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,192
Siu Sin

480
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,351
Stop!

481
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,114
You've misunderstood me.

482
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,996
In fact, I'm a nice person.

483
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,395
I saw you killed in Lan York Tze.

484
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,430
No,

485
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,395
they are not human.

486
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,709
You are inhuman for slaughtering
the innocent people.

487
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,435
You misunderstood me due to my look.

488
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,959
Listen, I am a demon hunter.

489
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,236
Those I killed are all demons.

490
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,391
You liar.

491
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,993
Why should I lie to you?

492
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,392
You mean Siu Sin is a demon too?

493
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,910
Yes, of course.

494
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,069
She's not a demon.

495
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:31,990
She is.

496
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,832
- She's not.
- She is!

497
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,036
Maybe you untie me
and I will show it to you with my magic mirror.

498
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,030
Give it to me.

499
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,795
How?

500
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,036
Let me help you.

501
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,116
You know how to use it?

502
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,197
You just wanna fool me to untie you.

503
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,153
Damn! You dare not face the reality.

504
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,953
Hey, what are you doing?

505
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,518
I told you to untie it not to chop it.

506
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,475
Forget it, you can't even hold the sword tight.

507
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,078
Liar, where are you going?

508
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,833
Dare you say you are not fooling me!

509
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,949
Grant me the power, go!

510
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,351
No...go!

511
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,069
Look.

512
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,792
Lan York Tze is just made up by
a 1 000-year-old tree demon.

513
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,793
You are lucky for getting out from it alive.

514
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,392
Come on. The path going downhill is over there.

515
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,149
Where are you going?

516
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,271
I just won't believe your trick.

517
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:08,948
I will look for Siu Sin myself.

518
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,469
Are you insane? I told you they are demons.

519
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,079
You are not falling for her though?

520
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,350
None of your business.

521
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,430
No way!

522
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,920
You can't afford that, just forget about her.

523
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:23,996
I can't.

524
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,231
You will be doomed if you don't retreat.

525
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:31,996
How could I get to Lan York Tze?

526
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,235
Damn!

527
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,949
He's obsessed!

528
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,275
Okay, I just wouldn't stop you
from killing yourself.

529
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,680
The path going to Lan York Tze is over there.

530
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,879
God bless you! Dying young!

531
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,035
Siu Sin

532
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,035
Siu Sin

533
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,235
Ning Choi San

534
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,069
I am a demon...

535
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,510
I know.

536
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,310
Want it?

537
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,469
I will get you out of here.

538
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,355
- I can't walk.
- I carry you on my back.

539
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,031
Siu Sin, why are you so cold?

540
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:21,039
Old demon casted black magic on me...
Don't look at me!

541
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,153
If you look, we will never get out.

542
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,677
Ning Choi San, put me down and I will walk myself.

543
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,593
I'd rather die in Black Mountain
than putting you down.

544
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:34,956
Bingo!

545
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,150
Shit.

546
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,356
Got hit.

547
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,074
Hocus pocus

548
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,438
Boundless tides

549
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,913
Yin Chek Ha, you can't land.

550
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,913
Stay here for tonight

551
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,869
and get moving at dawn.

552
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,989
Don't worry, they wouldn't know you are a demon.

553
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:55,477
Siu Sin, it's a bit messy, hope you don't mind.

554
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,353
Get a better inn tomorrow.

555
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:06,110
As the fire is lighted, it will be warm.

556
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,192
Feeling better?
I will get some stuff to keep warm.

557
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,518
Better?

558
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,474
How about this?

559
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:46,749
Ning Choi San

560
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,554
Are you bringing me with you?

561
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,876
Don't you scare that... I am a demon?

562
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:06,309
I am so poor, used to be.

563
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:11,114
I hate being bored but I have no choice.

564
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,514
Maybe that's my life.

565
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,637
I always bump into those I scare most.

566
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,679
I'm still worrying that

567
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:29,389
do you eat men like other demon?

568
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,038
We don't.

569
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,875
But that day...your friends...

570
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:35,871
ate the villagers...

571
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,871
at Lan York Tze..

572
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,952
They were not eating them.

573
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,837
They were sucking up their energy.

574
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,235
I know they are innocent.

575
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:52,510
If they didn't have evil thoughts,

576
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,190
they wouldn't have that smell.

577
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,312
And Lou Lou couldn't smell that.

578
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,271
then they wouldn't caught by us.

579
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,634
Do I have that smell?

580
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:15,468
Ning Choi San, you are a good guy.

581
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,837
We have no choice.

582
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:26,836
Years ago, Lou Lou got sealed up and badly hurt.

583
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,913
She then used her black magic to control us.

584
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,639
To suck up men's energy for her to break the seal.

585
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,913
If we didn't obey, we will be beaten up.

586
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:47,389
Or even beaten to death.

587
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,832
Don't worry, I will get you out of here.

588
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,874
From now on, you won't live like that anymore.

589
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,717
Siu Sin, how are you doing?

590
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,909
Hurt badly?

591
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:06,794
I will find a doctor and herbs.

592
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:13,599
It's been casted by Lou Lou. It's useless

593
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,994
I got it, you suck my energy.

594
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,629
Then you will be better.

595
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:20,516
Come on.

596
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,469
Feeling better?

597
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,957
If you still want more, be my guest.

598
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:06,670
Come on.

599
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:10,670
What are you laughing at?

600
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:12,875
I smelled that.

601
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:14,670
What?

602
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,512
You have that smell too.

603
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,269
What smell?

604
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,674
You bastard!

605
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:36,038
Reversing the heaven and earth.

606
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,150
That's the Old monster.

607
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,268
I am gonna break your magic.

608
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,229
Feeling dizzy.

609
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:54,438
Old monster, do you think
you can lock me up forever?

610
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,071
You wake up?

611
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,715
I will fetch something to eat.

612
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:10,596
Ning Choi San,

613
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:16,836
Nothing.

614
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:23,990
Nip Siu Sin,

615
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:48,151
Let me...take some dog's blood...
o break your magic.

616
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,954
You will come to your true form.

617
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,669
Siu Sin.

618
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,111
You afraid of me?

619
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,590
I won't eat you though.

620
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,877
You are not human.

621
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,355
Lou Lou,

622
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:41,869
please let us off.

623
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:45,115
Do you think I will harm you?

624
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:51,637
What you said really hurt me a lot.

625
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:56,593
Although you left without saying anything,

626
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:00,678
I am not that cruel as you thought.

627
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:05,793
I am here to see you off.

628
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:10,752
For all these years,
you have been fooling countless guys,

629
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:16,194
you finally find your Mr. Right.

630
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,438
I really envy you.

631
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,995
I am really happy for you.

632
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,229
But you forgot one thing.

633
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:30,719
Your body is still at Lan York Tze.

634
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,593
Without it,

635
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,269
you can go no where.

636
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:43,630
Sir

637
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:46,157
You are still alive? That's great

638
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,556
Bullshit! Where's Siu Sin?

639
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:49,756
She...

640
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:52,276
Ieft.

641
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,430
Left?

642
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,189
You ate so much by yourself?

643
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,035
I am starving.

644
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:03,995
Why are there 2 pairs of chopsticks?

645
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:10,274
You lied to me, you were with her the whole night.

646
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:11,954
I...

647
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,036
What did you do with her?

648
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,315
We...

649
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:20,395
How dare you!...

650
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:25,436
Demon is here.

651
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,836
Except Siu Sin, who is here?

652
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:30,189
No others.

653
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:31,396
Shit!

654
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:34,559
I won't let you hurt Siu Sin.

655
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:42,390
Tree demon?

656
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:44,992
Go back to Black Mountain, don't stay here!

657
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,235
None of your business!

658
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,277
You have no choice, go!

659
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:52,116
None of your business!

660
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:55,915
Ning Choi San...

661
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:58,436
Ning Choi San...

662
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,272
Come on, let's go!

663
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,157
Damn! Dog's blood is useless!

664
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,435
You will feel painful as you struggle, go.

665
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,272
Ha Suet Fung Lui, what do you want?

666
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:05,069
I am thinking.

667
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,114
Demon! Wanna run?

668
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:48,549
I will fix you up!

669
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:00,554
Yin Chek Ha! Look at you.

670
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:02,114
You screw up your whole life.

671
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:04,033
Cos you can't tell from right to wrong,

672
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,038
you always hang around with demons.

673
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:07,875
You are hopeless.

674
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,754
So what? Wannna fight?

675
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:12,310
You think you can beat me?

676
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,317
I can't beat you?

677
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:15,476
Go to hell!

678
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:31,915
Damn!

679
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,233
Why did you come here?

680
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:57,350
I came for your rescue.

681
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:58,515
Are you that nice?

682
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:00,637
I will come to you after fixing the demon.

683
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:41,155
See...

684
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,958
I can beat you with one hand.

685
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:46,873
Damn! Dare you chop it off.

686
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:50,032
Ha Bing, go!

687
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,150
Yes!

688
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:04,589
Demon...

689
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:08,312
Siu Sin, I am coming for your rescue!

690
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:17,599
Demon! Demon...

691
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:23,556
Chyun Cheung, I told you...she's a demon...

692
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,471
It's fine now...everything is settled.

693
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:28,154
- Don't worry, I will...
- Chyun Cheung

694
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,388
Iook at your hand!

695
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,077
Ha Bing, they are poisoned.

696
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:46,595
Quiet!

697
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:50,076
Chyun Cheung, gather everyone, we will have a way.

698
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:02,875
Chyun Cheung, What happened?

699
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:04,599
Are we turning into demons?

700
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,556
Chyun Cheung...do something.

701
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,393
Be quiet.

702
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,079
Be quiet! I have something to say.

703
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:15,109
This thing is connected to the blood.

704
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:20,029
As we get excited, it will grow faster.

705
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:24,637
So, we have to stay calm.

706
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:30,950
You... What don't you have that?

707
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,076
Come on,

708
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,430
I got 2 broccoli down there.

709
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,796
It's killing me...

710
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,549
Stop crying!...

711
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:44,630
It's not antidote, it can't clarify
your poison in your body.

712
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,475
But it can suppress the growth

713
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,318
of those plants.

714
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:51,473
The water you are drinking is poisonous.

715
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,389
It's the essence of a 1 000-year-old tree demon.

716
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:58,435
Once the tree demon is killed,
your poison will be gone.

717
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:02,310
Who will deal with that tree demon?

718
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,357
My brother, Ha Suet Fung Lui.

719
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,512
He's the best demon hunter!

720
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:17,230
Ha Suet Fung Lui,

721
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:20,351
I will pay you for what I owe you.

722
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,273
What can you pay me?

723
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,989
Chop off my hand. Or you want both.

724
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,834
I know you will go to Black Mountain.
I will be your pioneer.

725
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,838
I would even die for you.

726
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:36,709
Look at yourself.

727
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,991
You're begging for mercy for a demon.

728
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:42,188
Yin Chek Ha, you are so stubborn.

729
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:43,395
How stubborn I am?

730
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:45,233
I have been protecting Black Mountain.

731
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,479
You are protecting that demon though!

732
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:51,715
Yin Chek Ha,

733
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:53,954
who are you?

734
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:55,988
Do I have anything to do with you?

735
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:01,194
I am a human and you are a demon.

736
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:04,913
You have nothing to do with me.

737
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:09,389
Don't you recognize him?

738
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,870
For you, he's not been himself.

739
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,438
You are now telling me that
you don't recognize him?

740
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:18,475
Let me tell you...

741
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,033
he's your lover!

742
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,833
Are you done?

743
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:29,236
No...

744
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:31,789
You scum,

745
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:33,150
that's bullshit.

746
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:35,829
Dare you lie to me...

747
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:38,635
I will bite you!

748
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:40,270
Get lost!

749
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,395
You let me out.

750
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,158
I will bite you to death.

751
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:52,868
What are you looking at?

752
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:56,872
You are next.

753
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:01,194
Heard that? That's demon.

754
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:04,238
In fact you do know that.

755
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:09,396
Merciless, ungrateful, unfaithful.

756
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,831
Just like you,
betraying your master and fellows...

757
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,110
You are good for nothing!

758
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:16,675
Yin Chek Ha,

759
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:19,798
what did you get at last?

760
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:24,713
I do want to use your blood
to offer to my chopper.

761
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:27,471
Then I will deal with the tree demon.

762
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:30,158
But I changed my mind though.

763
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:33,478
But scum like you, even demon would dump you.

764
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:35,756
To kill you, it would ruin my chopper.

765
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:38,159
Don't you like her?

766
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:43,148
I want you to see her vanishing.

767
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:18,675
I am gonna eat for the rest of my life.

768
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:44,190
Bro, I go with you.

769
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:46,312
- No need.
- I can help you.

770
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:47,469
To collect my body?

771
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:51,639
In fact, there's none.

772
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:54,312
I will burn this Lan York Tze

773
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,553
and die with the tree demon.

774
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:58,599
That would be the best ending.

775
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:09,433
I first told you that

776
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:12,831
blood and sweat can be shed...

777
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:15,354
but no tears.

778
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:19,199
As a demon hunter, one can't think about love.

779
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,151
Otherwise, one will make mistake easily.

780
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:27,237
Like Yin Chek Ha, he's harming everyone.

781
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,557
I know, bro...

782
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:42,715
Siu Sin!

783
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:44,951
Siu Sin!

784
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:48,639
Ti Nga, is Siu Sin here?

785
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,676
Siu Sin is not here, let's go!

786
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:52,912
Go!...

787
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:54,639
- Siu Sin...
- Go...

788
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,675
Let go of me...

789
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,552
I'm warning you, don't talk like me.

790
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,076
I am here looking for Siu Sin...

791
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:06,714
Not a chance!

792
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,036
You know that she's a demon,
and you still save her.

793
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,590
No matter she's human or demon, I must save her.

794
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:22,556
No way!

795
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:27,670
Sorry.

796
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:34,195
Siu Sin!

797
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:37,430
Siu Sin!

798
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,236
Hey!

799
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:40,749
Untie me.

800
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:42,790
Siu Sin...

801
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,029
Ning Choi San...

802
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:48,675
I will get you out of here.

803
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:54,636
What are you doning?

804
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:55,511
No!

805
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:56,999
If you cut the wrong thread,

806
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:58,594
Siu Sin will be vanished right away.

807
01:12:58,880 --> 01:12:59,995
Let me down.

808
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,670
No way, you are here to catch Siu Sin

809
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:05,790
I can't let you down.

810
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,231
Idiot, you can't deal with this.

811
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:10,959
Don't waste time.

812
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,872
When all the coins are gone,

813
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,632
Siu Sin will vanish right away.

814
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,756
Let me down. Don't watch,

815
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,314
hurry...

816
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:28,829
Hurry up!

817
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:41,155
Siu Sin...

818
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:47,000
Why are you guys fighting
with your own fellows so hard?

819
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:48,754
Why don't you fight

820
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:50,758
the tree demon instead?

821
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:54,749
The disaster is coming.
If we don't get rid of the tree demon,

822
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,798
everyone in this village would be dead.

823
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:00,595
I could let an innocent demon go.

824
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:01,909
Yin Chek Ha,

825
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:04,759
will you save those innocent people?

826
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:13,913
We have to get to Lan York Tze before
it's getting dark, hurry.

827
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,189
You have to go?

828
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:25,677
You know what you will see at Lan York Tze?

829
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:27,514
A 1 000-year-old tree demon

830
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:29,234
and 2 poisonous snake demons

831
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,597
and other countless monsters too.

832
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:36,551
Scare me no more, I'm so scared.

833
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,593
But Siu Sin's body is there.

834
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:45,709
I have to save her.

835
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:09,231
Ning Choi San...

836
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:11,075
Don't worry about me.

837
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:19,948
As long as I could get your body

838
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:22,879
then you could leave that tree demon
and not to be under her control,

839
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:24,629
I would even die for that.

840
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:10,119
When I first got seal up...

841
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:14,514
you are the last one I saw.

842
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:17,557
I am free today.

843
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,391
The first one I saw...

844
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:22,793
is you also!

845
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:26,035
I even thought it's the same old day.

846
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:27,755
But...

847
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:31,275
you are getting old.

848
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:34,437
Not older than you.

849
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:38,277
Don't you remember? I am Muk Kee.

850
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:46,073
I have been hoping that

851
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:50,433
I could dig your heart and drink your blood.

852
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:08,678
I can't believe that you are so nice to me that

853
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:11,750
you would come to my door.

854
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:17,478
I really want to see the way you are dying.

855
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:35,958
So stinky, what's that?

856
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:38,551
Virgin's piss, my distinctive move.

857
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:39,835
Are you?

858
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:43,199
I have been keeping that for years, good?

859
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:48,390
Bro!

860
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:56,989
No wonder Lou Lou loves you so much.

861
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:01,433
You have brought all your lovers here.

862
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:44,511
You traitor, you can never leave Lan York Tze.

863
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:15,950
Ning Choi San, go down and open the stick...

864
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:17,229
...to look for Siu Sin's body.

865
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:22,195
Mighty eyes!

866
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:40,476
Fighters are ready to fight!

867
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:48,354
Ning Choi San, hurry!

868
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,831
Come on, I can't hold it anymore!

869
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:23,429
Hurry! Ning Choi San!

870
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:43,436
So cold?

871
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,591
Feel sorry? Yin Chek Ha.

872
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,595
Remember, Siu Sin is inside my body.

873
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:18,997
If I die, she will die too.

874
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:34,993
How to use this stick?

875
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:44,635
Fighters are

876
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:47,990
ready to fight!

877
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,631
Aren't you guys very fast?

878
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:36,028
Siu...Sin...

879
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:21,236
Fighters...

880
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:22,831
are

881
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:25,390
all

882
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:28,189
right...

883
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:30,630
in front...

884
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:46,189
Go!

885
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:13,348
Old hag!

886
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:19,469
Yin Chek Ha...

887
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:30,835
Siu Sin!

888
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:43,395
Siu Sin?

889
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:47,589
Siu Sin...

890
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:55,594
Come here, I'll bring you out.

891
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:57,995
Come on...

892
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:07,989
Candy.

893
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:28,829
I will bring you out.

894
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:45,996
Beating on her body but you do feel the pain.

895
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:49,710
Is it feeling bad?

896
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:52,951
Damn! Old demon!

897
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:55,596
Are you saying that I am old?

898
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:58,430
Better than you don't have that chance.

899
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,118
You wanna leave?

900
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:07,398
I will let your man see you off, okay?

901
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:09,074
Yin Chek Ha...

902
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:12,193
You have to kill your loved one.

903
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:29,229
Old demon...

904
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:34,916
Siu Sin...

905
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:36,354
Fighters are all ready!

906
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,237
Right in the front!

907
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:50,795
Mighty weapon?

908
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:09,230
Yin Chek Ha

909
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:10,716
Candy

910
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:12,869
Just kill me then

911
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:32,590
Old demon, I'll perish with you.

912
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:58,554
Yin Chek Ha!

913
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:28,116
Sorry.

914
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:33,237
To let you think of me.

915
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:53,391
Are you gonna choose for

916
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:56,437
My forgetting about you again?

917
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:17,829
I know.

918
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:34,234
Run!

919
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:39,393
Lan York Tze is just an illusion
made by the tree demon.

920
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:42,234
As the tree demon is gone,
everything here will be gone too.

921
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:45,390
Ning Choi San

922
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:48,397
Leave Lan York Tze with Siu Sin.

923
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:34,515
Go.

924
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:39,751
Siu Sin...go!

925
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:41,356
Bro!

926
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:50,434
Go or it will be too late... Siu Sin, go.

927
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:51,869
Go!

928
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:10,994
Ning Choi San

929
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:13,109
I won't.

930
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:16,113
Yin Chek Ha is right.

931
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:19,238
We can't be together.

932
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:22,718
No. I found your body.

933
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:26,958
After leaving Lan York Tze,

934
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:29,109
I am still a demon.

935
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:33,393
Put my body down,

936
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:36,110
Iet me vanish with Lan York Tze.

937
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:39,669
Maybe we will have the chance to meet again.

938
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:44,594
And I won't be a demon anymore.

939
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:47,835
Put it down.

940
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:52,793
I am not leaving.
I will stay with you and I'd rather die with you.

941
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:56,757
Get going, Lan York Tze is almost gone.

942
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:00,428
I can't do it...

943
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:04,628
I can't...

944
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:13,351
You would even die for me.

945
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:28,239
I know that.

946
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:37,279
Siu Sin!

947
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:41,392
Siu Sin!

948
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,352
What's it? So yummy?

949
01:33:57,480 --> 01:33:58,469
Candy.

950
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:03,273
I will love the one who gives me this.

951
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:52,355
Men and demon can't be together.

952
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:54,719
Don't fancy about that.

953
01:34:57,080 --> 01:35:00,595
It's all illusion.

954
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:02,275
Siu Sin!

955
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:28,350
Masters,

956
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:32,395
thank you so much.

957
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:35,757
- Thanks...
- Thanks...

958
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:41,233
Is it gonna get worse again?

959
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:44,112
You could check the trees.

960
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:48,239
Right, it's been a while

961
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,993
for not having green trees here.

962
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:53,869
Do drop by if you have time.

963
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:00,909
Ning Choi San
