1
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,997
You really will
have to rethink
your lifestyle, you know?

2
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:42,125
What lifestyle are you
talking about, Mum?

3
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,628
Wine only on Fridays.

4
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:49,590
And try to think about
dark green vegetables.

5
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:51,217
So really,
that's the same as saying

6
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,469
we'll never see
each other again.

7
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:56,472
Well, it is.
It just is.

8
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:03,938
How can I do
anything if I don't know
what you want?

9
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:08,234
She was
so upset about it,
and I said to her, "Look,"

10
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:11,612
I said, "you've got boobs.
They're there. Look."

11
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:15,950
Staying in is pathetic
when she could be out
having a good time...

12
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:18,661
I've gotta
go back in. No.

13
00:01:19,455 --> 00:01:20,830
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,459
I love you.

15
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:29,005
Racial hate.
That's bullying.
Just tell the teacher.

16
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,760
Yes, being too friendly,
it's the same as bullying.

17
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,596
Yes, it is,
so just tell the teacher.

18
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,556
What do you want?
I'm trying to get
something for tea.

19
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,559
Andy? Andy!
Is he one of yours?

20
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,771
Oi, Mate!

21
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,565
Mate, you can't park here!

22
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,525
You've gotta get back.

23
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:57,200
Don't knock it
till you've tried it.

24
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:59,035
This is magic
in a small plastic cup.

25
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,788
I've got
a fucking great big truck
parked right outside...

26
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,408
We're told
by Scotland Yard that
this is a major incident.

27
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,702
The emergency is
a major incident.

28
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:44,831
Still only being said
that there are several
people injured...

29
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:48,376
As we
go to air, Central London
is in chaos tonight...

30
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:55,341
40 minutes
into it, there was
a lot of confusion...

31
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,009
They do know now

32
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:58,845
that terrorism should be
the number one option...

33
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,429
Our priorities
have changed.

34
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:03,599
But it's
important for all of them
to be together on this...

35
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,793
Armed police!
Stay where you are!

36
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,046
Armed police!

37
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:36,173
Get your hands in the air!

38
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:37,717
Get on your knees!

39
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,303
Hands behind your back!

40
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,723
All we know so far is

41
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:46,809
that police have
arrested a man
after a dawn raid.

42
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:51,439
This man, Farroukh Erdogan,
of Turkish origin,
is rumored to be

43
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:54,483
the ringleader
of the group responsible
for the Borough bombing.

44
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:58,654
Mr. Erdogan's wife and child
were also taken into custody.

45
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,866
Police forensic teams are
examining a lock-up nearby.

46
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,242
...determination
of investigators

47
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:05,244
to track down
those responsible.

48
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,914
So,
what does the government
have to say about it?

49
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:10,458
They will not change
our way of life.

50
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,418
Defense
Barrister Simon Fellowes

51
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,587
refused to comment
on the Erdogan case

52
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,381
on his way into
the preliminary hearing.

53
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,759
This is going to be
a secret trial, isn't it?

54
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,553
In cases of terrorism,
there are circumstances

55
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:24,805
where to reveal
evidence in open court

56
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,642
would be highly
damaging to present
and future operations.

57
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:30,311
But crucial
prosecution evidence

58
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,188
will be concealed
from the defense.

59
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,440
If that was happening
in any other country,

60
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,067
you'd say it was
a rigged trial.

61
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,152
The accused will be
fully represented.

62
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,737
But not by
his own barrister.

63
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,447
In the open hearing,
in front of the jury,

64
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,616
he will be represented
by his own barrister.

65
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,284
In the closed hearing,

66
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:47,870
his interests will be
represented by
a special advocate.

67
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:50,414
But the fact is,
we're told this is
the trial of the century,

68
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,959
and yet we are not
being allowed to see
the full picture.

69
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,585
So questions
have to be asked.

70
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:58,631
The judicial process
in this country is
and will remain

71
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,383
fair and transparent.

72
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,635
Attorney General,
thank you.

73
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,800
Martin Rose.

74
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,058
And so today,

75
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,020
we mourn Simon.

76
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,022
And we ask,

77
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,399
as he took his own life,

78
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,109
was he alone?

79
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,988
For as any of us may find,

80
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:10,077
it's in this
solitary confinement
of the soul, as it were,

81
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:12,038
that we succumb to despair.

82
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:16,000
And in Simon,

83
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:20,087
a successful lawyer,
a popular man,

84
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:23,340
we see that none
of us is immune,

85
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,093
and that each of us

86
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:28,012
needs God.

87
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,059
Now let us pray.

88
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,700
Martin, are you going
to the house for drinks?

89
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:52,578
No, I have to
get back to London
and see my son.

90
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,497
Of course.

91
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,834
Terrible... Simon.

92
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,252
Yes.

93
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,380
I hear you're
stepping into his shoes
on the Borough bomb case.

94
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,134
Quite a challenge.
You know how it is.

95
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:08,677
But you're all right,
are you?
Sorry?

96
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:09,887
I mean, you're well?

97
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:12,264
Oh, I see. In my mind.

98
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,766
It's a good question.

99
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:17,269
What with the nasty divorce
and bitter custody battle
and all that.

100
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,230
Personal matter, I appreciate,
really none of my business.

101
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:22,108
Am I emotionally unstable?
I wouldn't
phrase it like that.

102
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,275
You ought to.

103
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,902
The very last thing
you want to see

104
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,570
is another neurotic
defense barrister

105
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:29,532
selfishly topping himself
before the curtain goes up.

106
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,367
How embarrassing
would that be?

107
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:33,869
Well?

108
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,831
You may rely on me.

109
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,478
Yeah, I needed
a cigarette.

110
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:02,731
Patches don't work for me.
My skin's too thick.

111
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,863
Comes from working
with bastards like you.

112
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,949
Okay, Devlin, our friend
the Borough Market bomber.

113
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,785
Oh. Another wonderful
human being.
Tell me about him.

114
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,997
Well, he's born in
a three-goat town
on the Turkey-Iraq border.

115
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,498
No birth certificate.
No papers.

116
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:23,544
1996, he gets
guest worker status
in Germany...

117
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:24,628
Without papers?

118
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,506
He's arrested for
possession in Berlin.
Explosives?

119
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:30,217
Heroin.
Arrives in London, 1998.

120
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:31,719
Gets married, has a kid.

121
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:34,513
They stay with
a sister-in-law,
one Mine Kemmal.

122
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:36,056
They stay with her
for three months

123
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:37,558
till she gets fed up
and chucks them out.

124
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:41,729
He bunks off back
to Germany to drive
a taxi in Düsseldorf.

125
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:44,273
2009, returns to London.

126
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,233
2012, bang.

127
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,360
So what's he been
doing for three years?

128
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:50,529
Becoming radicalized,
most likely.

129
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:52,531
The prosecution
will propose that

130
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,158
Erdogan is
the leader of the cell.

131
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,910
Of course, they will.

132
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:58,370
Two died in the bombing,
one resisting arrest.

133
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,498
Our client is
the last man standing,
therefore the evil genius.

134
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,125
There is a certain
convenience to it.

135
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,377
Could you find out
if it's too late for us

136
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:06,879
to change
the special advocate?

137
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,088
She was Simon's choice,
not mine.

138
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,549
Why would we want to change
the special advocate?

139
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:14,261
It's Claudia Simmons-Howe.
I'm not sure she's any good.

140
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,014
Happy birthday, My Lord.

141
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,475
My birthday
was a week ago.

142
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,312
Why are you
really here?

143
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,815
I'd like your advice.
Yes?

144
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:32,655
I think I should
resign as special advocate
for Farroukh Erdogan.

145
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,281
Why would you do that?

146
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,159
Well, there's a new
defense barrister.

147
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:38,994
Martin Rose.
Yes.

148
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,955
And I was appointed
by his predecessor,

149
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,666
so I think it's just cause
for an entirely new team.

150
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,043
Highly disruptive
to the defense.

151
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,169
But better in the long run.

152
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:50,005
Not what your father
would have done, Claudia.

153
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,465
Oh, that's hardly fair.

154
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,761
He would have
regarded the defendant's
interests as paramount.

155
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,596
As I do.

156
00:09:57,681 --> 00:10:02,518
In the biggest,
most high-profile
murder case

157
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,520
in British history.

158
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,983
Still,
perhaps you're right.
What?

159
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,943
Perhaps you
should be replaced.

160
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,698
No.

161
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:20,369
It's not that
I should be "replaced."

162
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:25,249
Especially as Mr. Rose
has himself expressed
a similar opinion.

163
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,918
He has?
So I'm told.

164
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,019
I'm not going to resign.

165
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,566
But the rules
are very clear.

166
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,484
The defense barrister,
that's me,

167
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,278
must have no contact
with the special advocate

168
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,281
once you've seen
the classified evidence.
Furthermore,

169
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,075
close social
or personal relationship

170
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,369
will be seen as
compromising the secrecy

171
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,955
of the closed evidence
which is not allowed.
Martin.

172
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,623
And then we'd both be
looking for a new job.

173
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,752
I am the special advocate.
Nobody is going
to take my place.

174
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:13,756
If that makes your
position untenable,
so be it.

175
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,841
Well, if you prefer,

176
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,177
we could just tell
the judge that
we had an affair.

177
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:38,655
So, when we're asked

178
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,325
if there are any
moral impediments to us
fulfilling our duties,

179
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,869
technically,
we'll have to lie.

180
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,621
Look, I'm fine with it.

181
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,581
I'm an arrogant,
unprincipled prick,

182
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,667
as you so succinctly told me
the last time we met.

183
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,669
I'm not lying on oath.

184
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:56,757
Once the classified
material has been served,

185
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:00,511
you must not meet,
nor communicate

186
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:04,139
nor share information
in any way,

187
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,809
nor may you be
seen to do so.

188
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,937
Your remit,
Miss Simmons-Howe,

189
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,732
is to solely address me
on the secret evidence,

190
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,819
which we will evaluate
in closed session.

191
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,241
Mr. Rose, you will
not see this material
unless I decide

192
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,618
it is relevant
and must be disclosed.

193
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,745
Do we understand
the rules?

194
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:32,000
Mr. Rose, do you know
of any reason related

195
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,378
to yourself or your
personal circumstances

196
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,756
which would
prejudice your ability
to carry out this case

197
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:40,968
or which might,
in any way, embarrass
the Lord Chancellor?

198
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:42,678
No, My Lord.

199
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:46,014
Miss Simmons-Howe,
do you know of any reason

200
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:49,101
related to yourself or your
personal circumstances

201
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,645
which would
prejudice your ability
to carry out this case,

202
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,272
or which might in any way

203
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,315
embarrass
the Lord Chancellor?

204
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:01,947
Miss Simmons-Howe?

205
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,325
No, My Lord,
I know of no reason.

206
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:20,090
There's no need to sulk.

207
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:22,259
I have an aversion
to wasted journeys.

208
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,635
Is that right?

209
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:25,929
You don't even know
what you're looking for.

210
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,056
Inspiration, Mr. Devlin.

211
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,072
I told you.

212
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,325
Nothing to see.

213
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,661
Nothing to look at,
which is different.

214
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:56,210
So, November 30th, 10:43.

215
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,837
Bright, sunny day.
Innocent people.

216
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,590
Truck approaches
from the west entrance.

217
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,134
Shouldn't be parked there.

218
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,345
Someone must
have noticed it,

219
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,305
but there's no time,
is there?

220
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,432
No time to do
anything about it.

221
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:12,851
10:44.

222
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,729
10:45, and then...

223
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:46,927
Later that day,
an anonymous phone call
tips off the police.

224
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,472
"Suspicious behavior"
by men at a lock-up
garage in West London.

225
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,975
The lock-up
rented to our client.

226
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,601
Our client knows nothing.

227
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:56,270
Yeah, because
he sublets the place

228
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,897
for cash to
a certain Mr. Asif, who,

229
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:02,651
sadly, is no longer with us
since he blew himself up
at the wheel of a truck.

230
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:06,113
Erdogan had no idea
what was being stored there.

231
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,323
Simon's line of defense.

232
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,284
As dictated
by the defendant.

233
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:13,787
So why does Erdogan
make 27 phone calls

234
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,081
to Asif in the 12 days
before the explosion?

235
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:19,167
Chasing rent
on the lock-up.
Very weak.

236
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,796
I want to see
every document
in this case.

237
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,757
Everything is
exactly as Simon left it.

238
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,134
And I've written
an inventory.

239
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,429
Ah.

240
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,056
Claudia Simmons-Howe.

241
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,268
Nazrul Sharma.
Home Office.

242
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:01,978
Call me Naz.

243
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,274
I brought you your safe
and your laptop.

244
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,321
This safe will be
securely installed here.

245
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:13,699
It is to be the sole
designated location

246
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,701
in which you are
permitted to store

247
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,078
the secret materials
in the case of
The Crown v. Erdogan,

248
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,664
which will be
delivered to you
prior to the hearing.

249
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:24,209
Um, this laptop must be used
for the creation and storage

250
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,253
of all documents
relating to the case.

251
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,297
No copies to be made.
Return to us upon
delivery of a verdict.

252
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,925
There's also this
code for the safe.

253
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,886
I'm supposed to get you
to memorize it and then
we burn it together,

254
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,680
but I think I can
trust you to do that.

255
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,015
You've done this
all before, haven't you?

256
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,519
You broke into my chambers.

257
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,148
It was open.
After you unlocked it,
I'm sure it was.

258
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,316
I think you're mistaken.

259
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,777
You're not from Home Office.
You're from Secret Service.

260
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,529
Secret Service?

261
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,991
One of the new intake,
I'd say. Post-July 2005.

262
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:59,453
Careers in Ml5.
"What can you do
for your country?"

263
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,872
The vetting seems to go on
forever, doesn't it?

264
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,166
But then one day,
you get your ticket

265
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,752
to the fast track
and you never look back.

266
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,879
Goes to your head,
of course.

267
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,215
Makes you think
you can do whatever
you want.

268
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,594
Like breaking into
a barrister's chambers.

269
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,765
I'm supposed to ask you
if there's anywhere else

270
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,475
you might take
the secret material.

271
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:23,518
Go on, then.

272
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:28,523
It's sort of personal
questions, isn't it?
I'd rather not, to be honest.

273
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,567
Whether anyone
lives with you.

274
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,445
Or whether there
might be anyone?

275
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:38,325
A special friend, perhaps,
who regularly or irregularly
spends the night,

276
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,368
that's the way
they put it.

277
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,412
You can leave now.

278
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,959
That's my number.
I know it's a very
complicated case,

279
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:51,254
so if you ever wanna
talk anything over,
you can give me a call.

280
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,131
What, though
I'm legally obliged,
quite specifically,

281
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:54,841
not to discuss it
with anyone.

282
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:57,302
There are people
who really want
a conviction here.

283
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:00,514
So if you're ever feeling,
uh, bullied or intimidated...

284
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,307
Oh, I can cope
with that, thank you.

285
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,184
Or threatened.
Threatened?

286
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,936
And what do you
mean by that exactly?

287
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,521
You can give me a call.

288
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,440
And what will you do?

289
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,987
Whatever needs
to be done, Claudia.

290
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,200
That is all.

291
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:44,683
Good evening.

292
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,562
Where's Mike?
He's done his back in,
hasn't he.

293
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,773
Too much sitting around,
I'd say.

294
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:24,783
I want him back by 3:00.
Oh, listen, Elizabeth,

295
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,201
I thought I'd
take him to Kingston.

296
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,078
Can we make it more like...

297
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,246
5:00?

298
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,627
Mum says I have to
wear a life jacket.
Of course.

299
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,136
Miss Simmons-Howe.
Mr. Devlin.

300
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:48,139
How are you?
Very well, thank you. You?

301
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:49,391
Devlin.

302
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:52,936
What is she doing here?

303
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:54,479
Ask her yourself.

304
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,731
She and I are not
allowed to communicate.

305
00:21:57,692 --> 00:22:01,069
An exception can be made
for the common courtesies.

306
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:05,240
Though evidently not,
in this case.

307
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,283
Until the delivery of
the closed material,

308
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:09,995
I am permitted
to communicate
with Mr. Rose.

309
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:13,248
Whether or not
I choose to do so
is another matter.

310
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,583
As I'm beginning
to understand.

311
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,711
So would you please
inform this gentleman

312
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:20,171
that I am here
to see Mr. Devlin?

313
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,549
She and I are going
to visit Erdogan,

314
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,551
as I told you
earlier today.

315
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:27,053
Thank you for reminding me.
I am the client's solicitor.

316
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:29,014
It's a matter of routine
that I'm present

317
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,224
at any interview
with the client.

318
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,686
I know that.
But would you please
inform the lady opposite

319
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,689
that I have first call
upon your services
and expertise?

320
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,774
Perhaps in
all the excitement,
Mr. Rose has forgotten

321
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,693
that there is a special
advocate on this case

322
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,029
and that we're both
representing the defendant.

323
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,782
I want to eat my lunch.
I was here first.

324
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:00,545
Terrorist scum!

325
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,024
Do you
want us to stay?

326
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,319
No. But could you
take the vomit with you?

327
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:28,823
There'll be
an eye in the hole.

328
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:34,579
Are you the doctor?

329
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,415
No. I have been appointed
by the Attorney General

330
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,625
to be your special advocate.

331
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,460
I told them I'm sick.

332
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:43,505
Has anyone explained to you
what a special advocate does?

333
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:44,714
No.

334
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,800
Nobody explained
anything to me. I'm sick.

335
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:48,343
So fuck you.

336
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:49,636
Mmm.

337
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:53,765
Mr. Erdogan, you are
accused of master-minding
a suicide bomb attack.

338
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,391
"Master-minding."

339
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:58,311
There is some
evidence against you,

340
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,563
which the prosecution
believes should be kept

341
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:03,274
secret from the public
and from you

342
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,735
in the interests of
national security.

343
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,612
What evidence?

344
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,949
I don't know yet,
I haven't been given it,
but when I am,

345
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:13,576
I need to understand
as much as I can about you

346
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:15,537
and why you say
you're innocent.

347
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:19,707
The secret evidence
will be assessed
in closed session.

348
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,877
The courtroom will be locked,
and there will be just myself,

349
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:26,089
the judge, the prosecutor
and a representative
of the security services.

350
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,423
I bet you all know
each other.

351
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,426
I'm on your side.

352
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:33,054
It's my job to
convince the judge

353
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:35,098
that you need to see
the secret evidence.

354
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:38,434
But I can't
do that on my own.
I need your help.

355
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:47,610
Where are you getting
the heroin, Farroukh?

356
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:56,327
Prison heroin is very impure,
that's why you're throwing up.

357
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:59,080
You should ask to be put on
their dependency program.

358
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:01,958
In Berlin,
you were arrested for

359
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:04,669
possession of heroin,
but you were released.

360
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:09,215
Why did they release you
without a custodial sentence?

361
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,134
I didn't stick around.
I got on a plane.

362
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,343
But how did you
get leave to remain

363
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:15,513
if you had a conviction
for possession?

364
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,226
May I ask you again?

365
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:24,022
How did you get
leave to remain
if you had a conviction?

366
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:25,773
I don't need
a whatever-the-fuck-you-are.

367
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:28,151
I need
a fucking doctor. Okay?

368
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:31,696
I wonder if Mr. Erdogan
is a little tired.

369
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:36,201
It's a long day for a man
in a place like this.

370
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,441
Then they
sent me back and said,

371
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,235
"No. Now you have to
take off your shoes."

372
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:12,487
And I mean, I'm wearing
stilettos, right?

373
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:13,863
What, do I have tiny,
little explosives?

374
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,323
You should try
being Asian.

375
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,408
I get stopped and searched
every couple of weeks.

376
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,536
I wouldn't say no.
Handsome, young policeman?

377
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,708
Martin.

378
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,628
You never come.
Are you drunk?

379
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,505
Not yet.

380
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:36,302
Does everyone know
Martin Rose?

381
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:38,388
Can I sit between two people
who hate each other?

382
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,932
I like to come as a relief.
Yeah, you can sit
next to me if you like.

383
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,268
But I should warn you,
I'm just a boring,
old civil servant.

384
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:45,103
Oh, that's hardly
fair, Melissa.

385
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:48,147
The work of
the Department of Transport
is vital to the nation.

386
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:49,524
You're doing me no favors.

387
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,693
What else can I say?

388
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:53,903
Traffic flow projections.

389
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:56,364
Flexible approaches to
variable speed limits
during peak hours...

390
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,865
I think
we can stop there.

391
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,326
You see, Mr. Rose,
I'm as good as my word.

392
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:03,371
Martin, may I
introduce Joanna?

393
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:04,914
Hello, Joanna.

394
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:07,250
I'm going through
a vicious divorce
at the moment

395
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,168
and will soon be
penniless, so,

396
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:11,546
from your point of view,
what would be the point?

397
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:15,842
Joanna, he's famously awful.

398
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:27,312
Hi. Just getting some air.

399
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,570
You're defending one of
the Borough Market bombers

400
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,155
at the Old Bailey.

401
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,533
Yes.
And you're a journalist.

402
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:43,578
In fact,
you're Joanna Reece.

403
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,456
Thirty-two.
Deputy Bureau Chief

404
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,875
on the London desk of
The New York Times.

405
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:52,503
You called Simon Fellowes
seven times on his
office number.

406
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,172
Three times at home.

407
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,758
He obeyed the rules
and filed a report.

408
00:27:57,259 --> 00:28:01,262
You also left your card
on my windscreen
at his funeral.

409
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:04,599
Sort of distasteful
thing to do, if you ask me.

410
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:08,770
Anyway, you hoped
I'd make contact,
which I didn't.

411
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:11,230
So you cooked things up
with a mutual acquaintance

412
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:13,858
and came here tonight,
in the hope that
I might get drunk

413
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,109
and you and I
could have a nice

414
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:17,403
off-the-record
chat about the case.

415
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,531
I don't
speak to journalists
at the best of times,

416
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:21,866
especially not about trials

417
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,535
relating to matters
of national security.

418
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,537
No matter how drunk.

419
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:31,417
If you knew that
I was here,
why did you come?

420
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,461
Curiosity.

421
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,172
I want to know
what your angle is.

422
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,548
Well,

423
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:39,926
are you sure
Simon Fellowes' death
was a suicide?

424
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:22,343
Middle Temple.

425
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,396
I will be told
some secret evidence.

426
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,024
If I'm going to
challenge that,
I need to know everything.

427
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:40,361
If your dad is convicted,
he will spend the rest
of his life in prison...

428
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:53,166
Actually,
I'll jump out here.

429
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:03,885
Devlin.

430
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:06,971
I just hailed the same
cab twice in one night.

431
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,891
In fact, three times
in the last two days.

432
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:13,269
Different part of town.
Different driver. Same cab.

433
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,854
How do you know
it was the same one?

434
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:18,232
Because I remember
the license number.
4-2-1-9-1.

435
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:22,195
Devlin, for some reason,
we're being managed.

436
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:28,784
You wanna
look at the forensic
report on the car,

437
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:30,495
or have you
memorized it already?

438
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,079
Memorized it.

439
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:35,875
TATP on the upholstery
on the front passenger seat,

440
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,752
the rear seat
and the boot as well.

441
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,796
May I remind you
that the client

442
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:42,924
has already determined
his line of defense.

443
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:46,177
And Simon Fellowes
was gonna follow
that line, was he?

444
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,597
That Erdogan gave Asif
a lift from the airport
to the station,

445
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,475
and the TATP on
the seats came from Asif?

446
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,229
If I was that stupid,
I would jump
off a roof myself.

447
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:58,523
Oh, you're such
a heartless fucker.

448
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:01,442
But, actually,
I don't think Simon
was that stupid.

449
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:03,444
I think he was
on to something.

450
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:05,154
I think he picked up
on the same thing I did.

451
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:06,572
Which is?

452
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:08,741
That it's a very,
very expensive car.

453
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,494
Where did they
find this car?

454
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:12,620
Chinatown.

455
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:15,706
Jade Temple restaurant.
Newport Street.

456
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:18,459
Excellent. Then I'll
go there for dinner.

457
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:32,932
Want something to drink?

458
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,141
Just a water, thanks.

459
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:48,906
Self-selection.
You must be Erdogan's
heroin dealer.

460
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,828
I know Mr. Erdogan came here
because his car was found
clamped outside.

461
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,496
I already
spoke to the police.

462
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:56,706
I'm not a policeman.

463
00:31:56,999 --> 00:32:00,418
I just have some
simple questions for you
with one word answers.

464
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:02,044
20 pounds a word.

465
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:07,133
When he bought heroin,
was it pure or cut?

466
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:08,634
Pure.

467
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:33,284
He asked you
the same questions
I just did, correct?

468
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,595
Morning, Claudia.

469
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,472
All set?

470
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:20,975
Oh, I'm supposed
to blindfold you.

471
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:23,769
Do you want to do that?

472
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,317
This room is bugged.

473
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:32,820
Not like you
to be suspicious.

474
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,322
I'm just saying.
It's routine around here.

475
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:39,410
Confidential conversations
are transcribed
and filed away.

476
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,203
Better be careful
what I say, then.

477
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:44,582
Yeah, or at least
speak clearly.

478
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:45,916
For the sake
of the typist.

479
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:00,222
The existence
of these premises

480
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:01,849
is covered by
the Official Secrets Act.

481
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,934
Any attempt to disclose
the existence or location

482
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:06,979
hereof will result
in prosecution.

483
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:14,278
Be gentle. She's fragile,
and he's a very sensitive boy.

484
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:23,829
Mrs. Erdogan,
I'd like to ask you
some questions.

485
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,249
Farroukh...

486
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:32,463
Why did you come back
to London from Berlin
in March 2009?

487
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,632
She says she don't
know why he came back.

488
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:37,927
Can you ask her
if he ever talked about
his time in Germany?

489
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:41,263
I just found myself
on a plane.

490
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,350
I was out of my head
most of the time so...

491
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:48,479
How often did he attend
the Lime Street mosque?

492
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:49,730
I don't know where he went.

493
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:51,357
Would you please
ask your mother?

494
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:59,281
She don't know.

495
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,492
I don't know how
often I called Asif.

496
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,911
I called him
all the time
to get the rent.

497
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,914
He was always
late with the rent.
That's why I called him.

498
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,545
But I've told all of this
to the queer guy before you.

499
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:14,046
Emir...

500
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:16,882
Would you please
tell your mother

501
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:18,467
that I'm on her
husband's side.

502
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:23,639
When I go into the court,
I will be told
some secret evidence.

503
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:27,977
If I'm going to
challenge that,
I need to know everything.

504
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,233
If your dad is convicted,
he will spend the rest
of his life in prison.

505
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,956
I used to do that.

506
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,625
What?
Play Medal of Honor?

507
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:53,794
No, I used to get angry.

508
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,798
Rather than
help people who were
trying to help me,

509
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:01,176
I'd just say nothing
as a way of
getting my own back,

510
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:04,555
even though the
only person I was really
hurting was myself.

511
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,724
You didn't know what
was in the lock-up?

512
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:10,102
You never went inside,
you just took the rent?

513
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,228
Yeah.

514
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,731
And the long calls to Asif
were an accident,

515
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,400
and all the money
you made were from
small-time drug deals?

516
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,568
Yeah.

517
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:19,862
Are you any good at it?

518
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,822
Medal of Honor, I mean.

519
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,956
I want her
out of here, now!

520
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:34,251
Don't wanna talk
to her no more!
I want her out!

521
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:48,265
Everything all right?
Mmm-hmm.

522
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,020
I don't have any
further questions.

523
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:03,447
Not yet.

524
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,872
So what was in
that note to Erdogan?

525
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,463
Give me a cigarette.

526
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:25,678
So what was
all that about, then?

527
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:30,474
Hmm?

528
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,896
When Erdogan came
to London from Germany,

529
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:38,107
he got immigration papers
within three months,

530
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:39,900
in spite of his
criminal record.

531
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:43,028
ILR usually
takes three years,
even if you're clean.

532
00:38:44,114 --> 00:38:46,365
Within six months,
he's driving
a brand new Mercedes.

533
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,825
He's spending
two grand a week.

534
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:49,743
He lied about
dealing drugs.

535
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:53,163
Before I went in there,
I suspected, now I'm sure.

536
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,582
Erdogan was
being run by Ml5.

537
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:03,007
No wonder
they're all so upset.

538
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,300
They must have thought
he had the cell
under control,

539
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:06,885
but either he
double-crossed his handlers

540
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,513
or the cell used him
to pass bad information.

541
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:12,266
Either way, Ml5 fucked up.

542
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:14,268
The arrest was a mistake.

543
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,353
But the telephone tip-off?

544
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:19,398
Would have gone
to the local police who
tipped off Scotland Yard.

545
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,358
Erdogan would have
been under arrest

546
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:23,819
before Ml5 could do
anything about it.

547
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,612
So now they're fucked.

548
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:31,702
This means that
Farroukh Erdogan,
who's on trial for murder,

549
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,495
almost certainly
paid for the explosives

550
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:36,373
that killed 120
innocent people

551
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:37,791
with taxpayers' money.

552
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:43,297
When Simon
got this far, of course,
they threw him off a roof.

553
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:59,540
Mussi Kartal.

554
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:45,919
It's actually quite convenient
to be under surveillance.

555
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:47,838
What's that?

556
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:54,178
Well, normally
getting a taxi can be quite
difficult this time of night.

557
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:05,856
I see you're using
more than one taxi now.
That's a good idea.

558
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,107
What did you say?

559
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:10,235
It's okay.
Apparently I'm paranoid.

560
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:38,472
- In here?
- Yes. You can go in.

561
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,015
Thank you.

562
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:48,732
Just passing?

563
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,151
I was visiting a friend.

564
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:53,237
Oh, that's nice.

565
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:55,906
How about you?
I hurt my neck.

566
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:59,201
I'm sorry. Accident?
You tell me.

567
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:01,662
Believe me,
I sincerely hope that it was.

568
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,582
I'm waiting for an X-ray.

569
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:08,585
If there's no fracture,
I can take this off
and go home.

570
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,837
Isn't that good news?
That is good news.

571
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:15,592
Look, Martin, I can imagine
what you're thinking.

572
00:43:15,677 --> 00:43:16,718
How this looks to you.

573
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:18,553
I've made no allegation.

574
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:20,847
But if we accept that they,

575
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,684
that someone,

576
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:30,315
then we have to accept
all sorts of things which
are simply unacceptable.

577
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,566
And I will not accept that.

578
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:33,986
You really know
how to clarify
a situation, don't you?

579
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:35,654
I'm not even here.

580
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:38,156
Then thank you
for your support,
Mr. Attorney.

581
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:43,078
There is
a temptation, Martin,

582
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,456
for any barrister
in a case like this

583
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,501
to stray.

584
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,878
To dig into.

585
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,339
What?

586
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:03,348
All right,
let me do it for you.

587
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:09,313
"Perhaps, Martin,
one should see this
as a cautionary event.

588
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:11,398
"Not so much a warning,

589
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:14,901
"merely a suggestion to remain
on the straight and narrow."

590
00:44:15,278 --> 00:44:17,321
Am I right?
Intuitive.

591
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,324
But incomplete.

592
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:25,537
You neglect to mention
your previous relationship
with Miss Simmons-Howe.

593
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:29,166
I wonder why.

594
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:32,252
Perhaps because,

595
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:35,005
and, please,
let me do it for you,

596
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:38,050
it's a weakness.

597
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:42,095
A weakness that could end
both your careers.

598
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:44,306
Am I right?

599
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,185
And perhaps that weakness

600
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:51,229
is the very reason
you were chosen for this job.

601
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,612
Goodbye, Martin.

602
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:15,337
Claudia Simmons-Howe,

603
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:17,089
this is the closed
material in relation

604
00:45:17,173 --> 00:45:18,590
to the case of
The Crown v. Erdogan,

605
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:21,551
disclosure of
which will damage
national security.

606
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:24,721
It must be kept,
by you, at all times
in a secure location

607
00:45:24,806 --> 00:45:27,557
until such a time
as a verdict is given.

608
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:29,309
Et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera.

609
00:45:30,812 --> 00:45:32,896
And if you wouldn't mind,

610
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,314
let's keep the
pen-pushers happy,
shall we?

611
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:54,543
Would you like me to
place them in the safe?

612
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:56,169
I'll be reading them
right away.

613
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:57,754
Of course. Fine.

614
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:01,341
You can leave now.

615
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,056
Oh.

616
00:46:08,141 --> 00:46:09,182
Lock's changed.

617
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:15,063
Ingersoll. Very nice.
It's the choice
of professionals.

618
00:47:35,937 --> 00:47:37,521
I'm being watched.

619
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:39,189
You always were.

620
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,982
That couple over there,
perhaps.

621
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:42,984
Probably.

622
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:46,863
Shall we?
You first.

623
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:50,367
Erdogan was
working for Ml5.

624
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:52,077
Very good.

625
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:53,954
But Erdogan's
not his real name.

626
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:55,789
It's Mussi Kartal.

627
00:47:57,124 --> 00:48:00,585
In 2008, there was a bomb at
a US Air Force base in Munich

628
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:02,420
which killed 20 servicemen.

629
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:04,631
Mussi Kartal was part
of the terrorist cell

630
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:08,009
that was aleg... allegedly
responsible for it.

631
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,971
Kartal was arrested,
but he cut a deal with

632
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:13,431
the prosecutors in
exchange for his freedom.

633
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:17,060
Ml5 liked the idea of a man
who was already compromised.

634
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,813
They brought him
in to be recruited by
a local terrorist cell,

635
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:22,899
the idea being
that he would help
plan a major attack

636
00:48:22,984 --> 00:48:25,485
but ultimately betray
his fellow conspirators.

637
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:27,487
At the last moment.
At the last moment.

638
00:48:27,572 --> 00:48:29,656
And that's where
it all went wrong.

639
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,325
That's why
the secret is lethal.

640
00:48:32,994 --> 00:48:35,579
Is that your headline?
Huh. No headline
without proof.

641
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:38,540
You've obviously never read
a British newspaper.

642
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,960
Why don't they
just kill Erdogan?

643
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,962
Then there
would be no trial.

644
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:46,715
There'd be no verdict.
No one to blame.

645
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:48,633
So we think
he has a deal, do we?

646
00:48:48,718 --> 00:48:51,386
He keeps his mouth shut,
plays along.

647
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,431
Doesn't mind
being found guilty,
and in return, he's safe.

648
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:55,515
Right.

649
00:48:56,017 --> 00:49:00,020
But defense barristers
who ask the wrong
sorts of questions,

650
00:49:00,813 --> 00:49:02,689
in this situation, well,

651
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:06,901
they're sort of expendable.
Aren't they?

652
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,655
Stay off
the rooftops, Martin.

653
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:36,723
Can I have a phone, please?
Pay as you go.
Any kind you like.

654
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:25,188
Oh, sorry.

655
00:51:15,698 --> 00:51:18,032
Excuse me,
can you take a photo of us?

656
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:35,300
Can I search your bag?

657
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,992
Ladies and gentlemen, Wembley,

658
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:03,745
please welcome the teams.

659
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:43,576
This better be good.

660
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:46,830
Farroukh Erdogan
was working for Ml5.

661
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:48,790
What?

662
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,793
Hold on. You have
evidence of this?

663
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:55,755
No. I'll handle it.
Trust me.

664
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:58,424
Martin, if that's
our client's defense...
It's not our client's defense.

665
00:52:58,509 --> 00:52:59,843
Then we need to
establish that.

666
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:02,929
We need to prove that
he was actually
working for the state.

667
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:04,806
You can't expose this.

668
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:08,184
Our client is pursuing
a simple line of defense.

669
00:53:08,561 --> 00:53:10,186
He won't challenge
the findings

670
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,397
but portrays himself as
an unfortunate bystander.

671
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:13,940
"Yes, My Lord,
there was half a ton

672
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,401
"of nitrate in my lock-up,
but it wasn't mine."

673
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:18,278
Let me handle it
in open session.

674
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:20,280
He will be
wrongly convicted.

675
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:22,031
It will constitute
a grave miscarriage

676
00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:23,992
of justice,
as you now know, Martin.

677
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:25,869
The client's instructions...

678
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:28,538
Were what?
"Send me to jail for
the rest of my life"?

679
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:33,418
The informant.
The anonymous informant.

680
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:35,587
Leave it, Claudia.
Don't go anywhere near it.

681
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:37,797
The informant must know.
That's what
they're trying to hide.

682
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:40,383
Let me handle it in
open session tomorrow.

683
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:42,552
I will act in our
client's best interest,

684
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:44,888
but not stand aside
while the state
perpetrates murder.

685
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:47,724
Another murder is what
I'm trying to prevent.

686
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:49,851
They make it
look like suicide.

687
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:52,061
Or an accident.

688
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:55,315
They got Simon
and they nearly got me.

689
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:57,108
Oh, for goodness sake,
Martin.

690
00:53:57,651 --> 00:54:00,069
I don't want them to have
a reason to get to you.

691
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,170
Anything else?
No.

692
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,914
This morning
is all about secret evidence.

693
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:56,542
Evidence
the defense want disclosed,
but which the prosecution say

694
00:54:56,627 --> 00:55:00,213
must be withheld
to protect our country's
security interests.

695
00:55:00,506 --> 00:55:03,174
The defense will
present their case,
and the judge will decide

696
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,760
which evidence can be
put in front of a jury.

697
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:09,389
As such, rumor has it,
some quite
senior members of Ml5

698
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:11,683
will be facing questions
from Mr. Erdogan's

699
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:14,644
special advocate,
Claudia Simmons-Howe.

700
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,188
All rise.

701
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:29,826
We are listed for both
a closed and open session

702
00:55:30,411 --> 00:55:34,038
to review the evidence
in Mr. Erdogan's case.

703
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:37,375
He's charged with murder,
conspiracy to murder,

704
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:41,963
conspiracy to cause explosions
and possession of explosives.

705
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:44,424
Before we begin,
we need to establish

706
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:46,217
the order of
today's proceedings.

707
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,346
I would suggest, My Lord,
that we begin with
the open material.

708
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:53,558
And the prosecution?
I have no preference,
My Lord.

709
00:55:53,642 --> 00:55:56,561
But I always believe
these matters are best left

710
00:55:56,645 --> 00:55:59,022
to the wisdom
and discretion
of the bench.

711
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:06,904
We will begin with
the closed material.
My Lord...

712
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:09,282
Prepare the court
for a closed session.

713
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:10,783
Mr. Rose.

714
00:56:31,013 --> 00:56:34,057
Wigs off.
We are now in closed.

715
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:36,517
The Crown argue
that this evidence

716
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:39,020
should not be disclosed
to the defense

717
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:41,439
in the interests of
national security.

718
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:45,359
It will be
presented for the benefit
of the Special Advocate.

719
00:56:46,487 --> 00:56:51,449
Miss Simmons-Howe,
I understand that you wish
to cross-examine

720
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:55,119
the Security Service witness
whom we will call Witness X.

721
00:56:55,204 --> 00:56:56,788
I do, My Lord.

722
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:19,894
Witness X, you are
the Security Service

723
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:22,313
Chief of Operations
in the Erdogan case?

724
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:23,606
I am.

725
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:25,399
You all right?

726
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,700
Taking it personally,
are you now?

727
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:38,621
You mustn't.
Nobody listens
to me, either.

728
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,249
That's life.
I just get on with it.

729
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:45,837
Think happy thoughts.

730
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:52,176
Will you confirm to
the Special Advocate
the identity of the informant?

731
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:58,266
The informant is
Mr. Erdogan's
14-year-old son, Emir.

732
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:01,269
Could you tell
the court why you believe

733
00:58:01,353 --> 00:58:03,396
it would harm
national security

734
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,524
to reveal his identity
in open court?

735
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:10,153
Following
Mr. Erdogan's arrest,
we discovered that Emir

736
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:13,656
had been hacking
his father's computer
for nearly three years.

737
00:58:14,366 --> 00:58:16,409
He has detailed knowledge
of communications

738
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:18,369
between his father
and significant people,

739
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:21,080
known and unknown,
in Istanbul,

740
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:23,416
Berlin and in Pakistan.

741
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:26,961
More importantly, he knows
many of the passwords
his father used.

742
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,671
But why do you not
want the boy's role

743
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:31,507
in the arrest of his father
to be revealed
in open session?

744
00:58:31,592 --> 00:58:33,342
Because he's asked
for absolute assurances

745
00:58:33,427 --> 00:58:35,595
that he will not be called
to give evidence in court.

746
00:58:35,721 --> 00:58:38,347
So he has expressly
requested anonymity?

747
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:42,727
And until this court
confirms that he will
remain anonymous,

748
00:58:42,811 --> 00:58:45,563
he's refusing to reveal
key pieces of information

749
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,523
that he's gathered from
his father's computer files.

750
00:58:47,733 --> 00:58:49,942
Are we sure
he's telling the truth?

751
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:51,861
Small amounts of information
he's already given

752
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:54,947
have proven sound
and extremely valuable.

753
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:58,367
And, presumably,
if it were to be
revealed in open court

754
00:58:58,452 --> 00:59:02,163
that Emir informed
on his father and worse,

755
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:05,875
that he's now in
a position to provide
the Security Services

756
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,502
with invaluable
information,

757
00:59:08,587 --> 00:59:11,797
there is a strong
probability that his life
would be in danger?

758
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:15,593
Good game?

759
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:17,678
What?

760
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:20,473
Last night.
Looked like great goals.

761
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:23,100
Yeah, yeah.

762
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:25,353
That's more like it.

763
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:31,984
- Excuse me a moment.
- Witness X...

764
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:33,986
I have some questions.

765
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:36,656
This is an important case
for Ml5, would you say?

766
00:59:36,782 --> 00:59:38,741
It involves national security.

767
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:40,076
Of course.

768
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,870
And I must say that
importance has been made
very clear to me,

769
00:59:42,955 --> 00:59:45,581
both professionally
and even personally.

770
00:59:47,084 --> 00:59:49,377
Your agents work very hard.

771
00:59:49,962 --> 00:59:51,462
I'll be sure to pass on
your appreciation.

772
00:59:51,672 --> 00:59:53,381
Miss Simmons-Howe.

773
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:56,926
Does all the information
on Farroukh Erdogan's
activities

774
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,094
come from his son?

775
00:59:58,178 --> 00:59:59,470
Yes.

776
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:05,476
And prior to the bombing,
there was no contact between
Ml5 and the defendant?

777
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:08,896
That's an odd question.
Nevertheless,
it has been asked.

778
01:00:08,981 --> 01:00:12,400
We had no reason
to link Mr. Erdogan to a plan
to blow up Borough Market.

779
01:00:12,693 --> 01:00:14,026
What about MI6?

780
01:00:14,403 --> 01:00:17,196
Not as far as I'm aware,
and I'm sure I would be,
if they did.

781
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:21,409
Isn't it the truth
that you don't want

782
01:00:21,493 --> 01:00:23,619
Emir Erdogan's identity
to be disclosed

783
01:00:23,704 --> 01:00:26,205
because you're afraid
of what he might reveal
about his father,

784
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:29,667
afraid that he
might reveal something
of his father's history?

785
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:31,168
What history?

786
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:34,964
Why did Erdogan
return to London
from Germany?

787
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:36,007
You spoke to him.

788
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:37,466
But he wouldn't
answer my questions.

789
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:39,051
Who paid for his ticket,
for example?

790
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:40,928
Perhaps you asked
the wrong questions.

791
01:00:41,013 --> 01:00:43,139
Or perhaps he had
been told not to answer.

792
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:44,724
Wait. What do you mean?

793
01:00:45,726 --> 01:00:46,934
You are claiming
that Farroukh Erdogan

794
01:00:47,019 --> 01:00:49,103
was what was known
as a "clean skin"?

795
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:50,896
Yes.

796
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:53,316
That he was not considered
to be a person of interest?

797
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,400
No.

798
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:55,651
You had
no surveillance on him?

799
01:00:55,736 --> 01:00:58,070
He was not
on your radar?
No.

800
01:00:58,155 --> 01:01:01,157
You were not handling him
as an Ml5 agent?

801
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,999
Are you familiar with
the name Mussi Kartal?

802
01:01:12,127 --> 01:01:13,836
That name is new to me.

803
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,923
Miss Simmons-Howe,
where is this line of
questioning leading?

804
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:20,051
My Lord, to answer that,
I need an adjournment.

805
01:01:20,135 --> 01:01:21,135
A what?

806
01:01:21,428 --> 01:01:23,929
I wish to question the boy,
Emir Erdogan, here in court.

807
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:28,517
That boy holds the key
to unlock information
that may save lives.

808
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:30,227
I believe he will
support the case

809
01:01:30,312 --> 01:01:32,730
that Farroukh Erdogan
was known to Ml5,

810
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:35,232
that he was
working with Ml5,

811
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:38,611
and that, in fact,
he was working for Ml5
at the time of the bombing.

812
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:43,157
I believe Emir Erdogan
has evidence that will
support that claim.

813
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:46,118
I believe his testimony
will expose the malpractice

814
01:01:46,203 --> 01:01:48,412
and incompetence of
the Security Service,

815
01:01:48,497 --> 01:01:50,873
and demonstrate that
his father was nothing
more than a pawn

816
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:52,541
in the hands of Ml5,

817
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:54,960
who used him to snare
genuine terrorists

818
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:57,254
in an operation
that went tragically

819
01:01:57,339 --> 01:02:01,634
and murderously wrong
for 120 people on that day.

820
01:02:03,095 --> 01:02:06,013
Evidence?
I believe so.

821
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:13,062
Just five seconds
of your time, sir.

822
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,398
Mr. Rose,
can I ask you a question?

823
01:02:15,482 --> 01:02:17,024
Five seconds of your time.

824
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:38,045
Mr. Altman,

825
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:42,425
the Crown will arrange
to bring Emir Erdogan
to court.

826
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:46,971
I will question him myself.
10:00 a.m. Tomorrow.

827
01:02:47,055 --> 01:02:49,849
My Lord...
Tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.

828
01:02:56,523 --> 01:02:59,233
Miss Simmons-Howe,
where is she?
You just missed her, sir.

829
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:10,202
Nothing but
a civil servant, right?

830
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:12,621
I don't know what
just happened in there,
but whatever did...

831
01:03:12,706 --> 01:03:14,373
Please wait.

832
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:16,625
Claudia was just
trying to do her job.

833
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:18,419
We're simply trying
to defend our client.

834
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:21,005
Your client is a guilty man.

835
01:03:21,089 --> 01:03:23,424
And you know this because
he worked for you.

836
01:03:24,885 --> 01:03:27,052
He was inside the cell.

837
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:29,638
He didn't tell
you what happened,
and you assume

838
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:32,141
that this means that
he deliberately duped you.

839
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:35,978
But they could have
crossed him as well.
There is doubt.

840
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:38,814
You lawyers, you like your
fucking doubt, don't you?

841
01:03:39,024 --> 01:03:40,316
Well, I can't use doubt.

842
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,484
I can only use certainty.

843
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:44,278
I need certain knowledge
in order to do my job.

844
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:46,238
To save lives.

845
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,657
You people,
you're all the same.

846
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:49,825
You want
the freedom to attack me,

847
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:52,411
but without me,
you wouldn't have
much freedom at all.

848
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:56,415
Your girlfriend should have
kept her mouth shut.

849
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:10,179
Ladies and gentlemen,

850
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:13,641
at this time of
heightened security,
it is important...

851
01:04:19,064 --> 01:04:20,814
Claudia, it's me.

852
01:04:20,899 --> 01:04:24,610
Turn off your phone,
dump your bag,
dump everything

853
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:27,571
and meet me at
the first place
I took you to.

854
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:29,782
The first place
I took you to.

855
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:32,243
The accused, Farroukh Erdogan,

856
01:04:32,327 --> 01:04:34,370
appeared briefly
in court number one

857
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:37,748
and pleaded not guilty to
all the charges against him.

858
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:48,926
They want you.
In court.

859
01:04:50,095 --> 01:04:51,637
To give evidence.

860
01:04:54,224 --> 01:04:55,558
Are you okay
with that, Emir?

861
01:04:58,812 --> 01:05:01,522
I saw you. With my father.

862
01:05:03,275 --> 01:05:05,317
There's a lot of blokes
look like me.

863
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:15,786
...what information
should be kept secret

864
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:17,830
in the interest of
national security

865
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,707
and what information
should be disclosed...

866
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:21,625
We leave at 9:00.

867
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,544
I'll drive you
there myself.

868
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:27,006
...what seems increasingly
a crucial question.

869
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:28,507
We don't know who appeared,

870
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:32,428
we don't know what was said,
we don't know
what's being considered.

871
01:05:32,512 --> 01:05:35,389
The case will
continue tomorrow.

872
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:08,130
She don't know...

873
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:09,965
Emir, would you...

874
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:25,356
New message.

875
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,775
Hi, Claudia,
this is Sophie from Chambers.

876
01:06:27,859 --> 01:06:30,819
Just calling and hope that
we can reschedule our
meeting for next week

877
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:32,071
from Monday to Thursday...

878
01:06:40,455 --> 01:06:42,665
Claudia, if you're at home,
get out of there.

879
01:06:42,749 --> 01:06:44,583
Please meet me
at the first place
I took you to.

880
01:07:08,233 --> 01:07:09,566
Come on!

881
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:25,666
It's been so long.
Listen, I need your help.

882
01:07:56,656 --> 01:07:58,824
Don't.
You're hurt.

883
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:03,328
I said, "Don't."

884
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:07,624
You're bleeding.
Yeah. Well,
it's not my blood.

885
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:15,007
Claudia, what happened?

886
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:30,856
Well?

887
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:42,451
You're safe now.

888
01:08:58,343 --> 01:09:01,220
The informant
is his son, Emir.

889
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:02,846
Emir?

890
01:09:06,184 --> 01:09:09,561
But he's just a child.
He knows something, Martin.

891
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:11,647
They're clearly scared of him.

892
01:09:11,731 --> 01:09:13,524
They've put him
in a safe house.

893
01:09:13,608 --> 01:09:15,192
He has evidence.

894
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:19,029
Of his father's
links to Ml5.

895
01:09:22,033 --> 01:09:24,618
I wanted to see
how they would react.

896
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:26,829
Yeah, well, now you know.

897
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,747
If you even begin to say,
"I told you so."

898
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:30,165
No, Claudia, I...
Because I...

899
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:31,750
All I care about is...

900
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,852
We're not strong enough
to fight them, are we?

901
01:09:51,396 --> 01:09:52,646
No.

902
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:58,277
There's no good way
out of this, is there?
There's no...

903
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:02,447
There is no right
way out of this.

904
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:05,951
No.

905
01:10:11,082 --> 01:10:12,708
Sorry, Claudia.

906
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:13,959
Hmm.

907
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:24,970
So how do we do it?

908
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:29,391
I'll call them and tell them
that we'll do as we're told.

909
01:10:29,517 --> 01:10:32,144
It's that simple?
Yes.

910
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:34,479
That simple.

911
01:11:05,345 --> 01:11:06,386
What?

912
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:07,471
Nothing.

913
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:16,271
I hate that they hurt you.

914
01:11:26,741 --> 01:11:29,201
I don't want to be here
when you make the call.

915
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:33,080
I don't want to
hear you do it.

916
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:10,867
It's Martin Rose.
I need to talk to
Melissa Fairbright

917
01:12:10,952 --> 01:12:13,537
or whoever it is that uses
that pseudonym, please.

918
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:22,129
Yes?
Melissa,
it's Martin Rose.

919
01:12:23,214 --> 01:12:24,673
I'm calling to
make a deal.

920
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:26,299
Never mind
your fucking deal.

921
01:12:26,509 --> 01:12:27,592
Where's the boy?

922
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:29,803
What?

923
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:39,771
Emir's gone.
He's broken out
of the safe house.

924
01:12:39,856 --> 01:12:41,106
We don't have long.
They'll trace my line.

925
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:42,899
If they find him,
they'll kill him.
They will kill him.

926
01:12:42,984 --> 01:12:45,152
Well, then
we have to stop them.
How?

927
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:48,447
We get him to court.

928
01:12:48,531 --> 01:12:51,783
If we get him to court,
his evidence will protect him.

929
01:12:52,243 --> 01:12:54,161
His old flat.
He's not stupid.

930
01:12:54,245 --> 01:12:55,829
He'll know
they're watching him.

931
01:12:55,913 --> 01:12:57,289
Where would a boy
that age go?

932
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:59,624
He could be out
on the streets,
could be anywhere.

933
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,135
Claudia.

934
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,991
I sent to my aunt.

935
01:13:33,076 --> 01:13:34,534
"I sent to my aunt."

936
01:13:34,869 --> 01:13:36,536
That's what he said.

937
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:39,915
Yes?

938
01:13:41,334 --> 01:13:42,501
Right.

939
01:13:43,878 --> 01:13:45,128
Well, keep looking.

940
01:13:50,218 --> 01:13:51,635
Mrs. Kemmal,

941
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:55,055
we've learned that
your nephew has escaped.

942
01:13:55,473 --> 01:13:59,226
Has run away from
the place where he was
being looked after.

943
01:13:59,644 --> 01:14:01,144
Has he sent you
anything recently?

944
01:14:01,229 --> 01:14:02,646
I have not heard from him.

945
01:14:03,106 --> 01:14:04,856
Or seen him?
No.

946
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:08,151
Mrs. Kemmal,
we want to help Emir.

947
01:14:09,362 --> 01:14:11,363
But it's more than that.

948
01:14:12,198 --> 01:14:14,533
I think that he could be
in great danger.

949
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:17,536
We want to protect him.

950
01:14:21,541 --> 01:14:23,333
I made a mistake.

951
01:14:23,668 --> 01:14:25,335
We've all made mistakes.

952
01:14:27,004 --> 01:14:28,255
Here's the evidence.

953
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:30,549
Everything you need
from Dad's hard drive.

954
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:32,884
It's them.

955
01:14:50,069 --> 01:14:51,069
Oi!

956
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:53,548
You have every advantage
our society can offer.

957
01:15:53,633 --> 01:15:55,550
But will you defend it?

958
01:15:55,885 --> 01:15:58,303
No, you leave
that to someone else.
So I fight a war

959
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:00,055
against men who'd
see you wrapped up

960
01:16:00,139 --> 01:16:02,515
in a mask the moment
you look like a woman.

961
01:16:15,321 --> 01:16:17,155
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

962
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:24,871
Are you all right?
They didn't get me.

963
01:16:31,879 --> 01:16:34,506
Hello.
Listen, we've got the boy.

964
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:36,675
Who? What are you
talking about?

965
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:38,802
Emir Erdogan.
They were going to kill him.

966
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:41,096
Jesus, Martin.

967
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:43,139
What the hell have you
got yourself into?

968
01:16:43,224 --> 01:16:46,017
I need you to meet me.
He's not safe with us.

969
01:16:46,644 --> 01:16:47,769
I need you to
look after him.

970
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:50,897
Make sure that
he gets to the court
by 10:00 tomorrow.

971
01:16:51,107 --> 01:16:52,857
Can you do that for me?

972
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:57,028
All right.
All right, bring him here.

973
01:16:57,363 --> 01:17:00,824
No, I'll meet you at
the back of King's Cross
in an hour from now.

974
01:17:00,908 --> 01:17:03,034
Okay.
Back of King's Cross tunnel.

975
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:05,328
At 3:30.

976
01:17:05,705 --> 01:17:07,872
I'll be there.
And, Martin...

977
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:10,208
You be careful.

978
01:17:10,293 --> 01:17:11,334
You know what?

979
01:17:11,419 --> 01:17:13,795
It's a bit
bloody late for that.

980
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:27,726
Do you think it'll work?

981
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:29,728
It'll buy us a few hours.

982
01:18:09,602 --> 01:18:11,561
He'll see you.
No, he won't.

983
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:13,605
Because he's not coming.

984
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:16,107
If he was,
he'd be here by now.

985
01:18:18,069 --> 01:18:20,070
He doesn't
trust you, Devlin.

986
01:18:21,364 --> 01:18:22,864
And you assured us
you could control him,

987
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:24,991
steer him in
the right direction.

988
01:18:26,118 --> 01:18:28,578
Sorry.
I have to make
a decision now.

989
01:18:31,207 --> 01:18:32,665
Do you understand?

990
01:18:34,085 --> 01:18:36,795
Devlin.
I'd never have thought.

991
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:39,381
Only two people knew
I was at the football.

992
01:18:40,174 --> 01:18:41,633
You and Ml5.

993
01:18:42,301 --> 01:18:44,969
The moment he asked
about the game, I knew.

994
01:18:47,431 --> 01:18:49,766
Your son's?
Yes.

995
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:52,227
How old is he now?

996
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:59,442
Old enough
to know how much
I fucked up his life.

997
01:19:05,116 --> 01:19:07,283
In so many ways,

998
01:19:07,368 --> 01:19:09,661
you were the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

999
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:12,539
Oh.

1000
01:19:13,874 --> 01:19:17,502
You were
undoubtedly the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

1001
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,926
They'll be waiting for us.

1002
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:27,095
I know.

1003
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:31,516
What if they stop us
before we get to court?

1004
01:19:34,812 --> 01:19:36,312
Well, at least we tried.

1005
01:19:49,743 --> 01:19:51,828
This is
a security announcement.

1006
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:56,499
If you see anything suspicious
or anyone acting suspiciously,

1007
01:19:56,584 --> 01:20:00,712
please report it immediately
to a member of staff
or the police.

1008
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:22,442
Hello, yeah?

1009
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:26,154
Okay.
You know the plan.

1010
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:47,425
Mr. Rose...

1011
01:20:49,053 --> 01:20:51,095
Will justice be
served in court today?

1012
01:22:42,416 --> 01:22:45,543
Mr. Altman,
are we ready to proceed?

1013
01:22:47,171 --> 01:22:49,672
My Lord,
I call Emir Erdogan

1014
01:22:49,757 --> 01:22:53,718
to answer any questions
that the court or
Miss Simmons-Howe may have.

1015
01:23:04,188 --> 01:23:07,023
I swear by Allah
that the evidence
I shall give

1016
01:23:07,107 --> 01:23:10,735
shall be the truth,
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

1017
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:16,491
How's the neck?

1018
01:23:19,745 --> 01:23:21,412
Much better.

1019
01:23:21,497 --> 01:23:22,997
That is good news.

1020
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:26,584
I wondered
if you and I might...

1021
01:23:27,628 --> 01:23:29,629
We could go for breakfast.

1022
01:23:29,713 --> 01:23:32,799
You and I?
Yes. Wouldn't that be nice?

1023
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:44,811
Emir, I have
some questions for you.

1024
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:48,606
Do you recognize this?
That's my memory stick.

1025
01:23:48,816 --> 01:23:51,150
My Lord, might this
be exhibit number one.

1026
01:23:51,235 --> 01:23:53,653
There are a number
of files that are
of potential relevance

1027
01:23:53,737 --> 01:23:55,405
and which I would
now like to examine.

1028
01:23:55,489 --> 01:23:57,990
I expect he's in
full flow by now.

1029
01:23:58,992 --> 01:24:01,077
Don't you think? The boy.

1030
01:24:01,787 --> 01:24:06,124
As I understand it,
his evidence could cause
a mighty furore.

1031
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:08,459
Well, well...

1032
01:24:09,712 --> 01:24:13,423
But I wouldn't want
this trial to be the end
of your career, Martin.

1033
01:24:13,716 --> 01:24:17,802
Which it would be,
if all the facts
were to be revealed.

1034
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:19,512
Facts?

1035
01:24:20,931 --> 01:24:22,765
About how you
and the Special Advocate

1036
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:25,101
were in frequent
communication.

1037
01:24:25,519 --> 01:24:28,438
Indeed, that you went
so far as to meet up.

1038
01:24:29,565 --> 01:24:32,024
Quite contrary to the terms
of your binding oath.

1039
01:24:35,612 --> 01:24:36,821
My advice...

1040
01:24:39,992 --> 01:24:42,201
My heartfelt,

1041
01:24:42,286 --> 01:24:44,287
sincere advice as a...

1042
01:24:46,123 --> 01:24:49,292
Well, my advice is to
let it go, all of it.

1043
01:24:51,628 --> 01:24:53,254
You see...

1044
01:24:53,338 --> 01:24:54,505
What am I?

1045
01:24:55,507 --> 01:24:57,925
Government senior
law officer.

1046
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:01,387
Advisor to the
Prime Minister.

1047
01:25:01,472 --> 01:25:02,847
It means nothing.

1048
01:25:02,973 --> 01:25:05,850
There are powers at play
that neither you nor I,

1049
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:07,477
nor the Prime Minister,
for that matter,

1050
01:25:07,561 --> 01:25:09,437
may even hope to control.

1051
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:12,148
I mean, not entirely.
Not at the very
essence of the term.

1052
01:25:14,485 --> 01:25:16,152
So there is,

1053
01:25:16,862 --> 01:25:18,362
you see,

1054
01:25:19,698 --> 01:25:22,033
a certain
inevitability about it,
wouldn't you say?

1055
01:25:23,827 --> 01:25:25,328
About what?

1056
01:25:26,330 --> 01:25:28,039
- The collapse of the case.
- What else?

1057
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:35,046
I just have this feeling,
don't you?

1058
01:25:37,758 --> 01:25:40,760
Who's to say? Perhaps
it's better that way.
Erdogan.

1059
01:25:42,471 --> 01:25:43,471
Safe until he isn't, right?

1060
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:45,556
As I say,
it's just a feeling.

1061
01:25:46,141 --> 01:25:47,558
A premonition.

1062
01:25:48,101 --> 01:25:49,227
Call it what you will.

1063
01:25:52,189 --> 01:25:54,524
A calamity for justice,
of course.

1064
01:25:55,567 --> 01:25:57,318
Now, we can fret about it,

1065
01:25:57,945 --> 01:25:59,529
become indignant,

1066
01:25:59,613 --> 01:26:03,324
write an angry letter
to the newspapers
or our Members of Parliament.

1067
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:04,575
Won't make any difference.

1068
01:26:08,247 --> 01:26:10,957
Emir's evidence
is being heard
in closed session

1069
01:26:11,041 --> 01:26:12,834
and that is
where it will remain.

1070
01:26:13,585 --> 01:26:15,503
It will be presented
in accordance with the law,

1071
01:26:15,587 --> 01:26:17,672
then the evidence
will be placed in a box.

1072
01:26:17,756 --> 01:26:20,007
The box will then be closed

1073
01:26:20,092 --> 01:26:22,218
and it will never
be opened again.

1074
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:52,540
Of course, there'll be
the inevitable
government inquiry,

1075
01:26:52,624 --> 01:26:54,208
which will take
a number of years

1076
01:26:54,293 --> 01:26:56,794
and will fail to
reach any conclusions.

1077
01:26:56,879 --> 01:26:59,255
But if no one misbehaves,

1078
01:26:59,339 --> 01:27:01,841
no one larks around at
the back of the class,

1079
01:27:01,925 --> 01:27:05,636
Emir and Ilkay Erdogan
will not be deported to
somewhere unpleasant.

1080
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:08,472
They will be
allowed to live here.

1081
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:14,729
You try not to
forget that, Martin.

1082
01:27:16,523 --> 01:27:18,983
That is your part
of the bargain.

1083
01:28:00,567 --> 01:28:03,361
Responding to
news of the collapse
of the case this morning,

1084
01:28:03,445 --> 01:28:05,947
the Attorney General
made the following statement.

1085
01:28:06,031 --> 01:28:08,199
This is a major
disappointment.

1086
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:10,159
With the eyes of
the world upon us,

1087
01:28:10,243 --> 01:28:12,703
it saddens me hugely that
we weren't able to show

1088
01:28:12,788 --> 01:28:16,624
the great strength
of our legal process
and judicial system.

1089
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:17,792
I will, of course...

1090
01:29:14,516 --> 01:29:16,600
You never
answer your phone.

1091
01:29:17,686 --> 01:29:19,520
I never know
what to say.

1092
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:25,693
Emir and his mother
have been allowed to stay.

1093
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:30,114
But I guess you
already knew that.

1094
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:41,917
You blame yourself.

1095
01:29:45,797 --> 01:29:46,839
Mostly.

1096
01:29:48,717 --> 01:29:50,301
Well, that's good.

1097
01:29:51,344 --> 01:29:54,597
The old Martin Rose
would never have accepted
the blame for anything.

1098
01:29:54,681 --> 01:29:56,015
I only said, "Mostly."

1099
01:29:56,099 --> 01:29:57,850
Well, that's even better
'cause that means

1100
01:29:57,934 --> 01:30:00,394
the old Martin Rose
has not entirely gone.

1101
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:03,230
But no longer practicing.

1102
01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:06,067
Please ask the stenographer
to put that on the record.

1103
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:07,651
See, I know
where this is going.

1104
01:30:09,488 --> 01:30:11,072
And the answer is "no."

1105
01:30:11,156 --> 01:30:13,115
It will be just like
being here, doing this.

1106
01:30:15,035 --> 01:30:18,954
I get it.
And for the next bit,
you tell me that

1107
01:30:19,039 --> 01:30:20,414
the law needs
men of integrity.

1108
01:30:20,499 --> 01:30:22,666
Yeah, it does.

1109
01:30:24,086 --> 01:30:27,505
But that doesn't mean that
there's also a place
for someone like you.

1110
01:30:43,355 --> 01:30:45,106
Usually after I...

1111
01:30:46,024 --> 01:30:47,858
There's a place
not far from here.

1112
01:30:48,902 --> 01:30:51,237
It's not very good.
It's a bit over-priced.

1113
01:30:51,488 --> 01:30:53,739
I can't honestly
recommend it.

1114
01:30:54,825 --> 01:30:57,535
But um, you're welcome
to join me.

1115
01:30:59,955 --> 01:31:02,039
In fact, I'd be
very happy if you did.

1116
01:31:19,432 --> 01:31:20,766
Order!

1117
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:22,810
Order! Order!

1118
01:31:22,894 --> 01:31:27,148
Would the Attorney General
care to comment on
the rumors of a cover-up

1119
01:31:27,232 --> 01:31:29,733
in the collapse of the
Farroukh Erdogan case?

1120
01:31:29,818 --> 01:31:34,947
And does he still
consider our legal system
to be fair and transparent?

1121
01:31:35,657 --> 01:31:37,950
I am certain that
as I stand here today,

1122
01:31:38,076 --> 01:31:41,954
our justice system stands out
as a beacon of clarity...

1123
01:31:42,038 --> 01:31:45,666
Stands out as a beacon
of clarity, of equality

1124
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:48,544
and, above all, of integrity.

1125
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:52,423
- Resign! Resign!
- Order!
