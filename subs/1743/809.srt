Call me back? Yeah, yeah. You, too.

139
00:09:34,219 --> 00:09:36,517
嘿，问你个问题
Hey, I got a question for you.

140
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:38,147
史蒂芬・柯林斯
Stephen Collins.

141
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,882
他是你的老朋友，没错吧？
He's an old friend of yours, is that right?

142
00:09:41,093 --> 00:09:42,117
没错
Yeah.

143
00:09:42,194 --> 00:09:44,389
我叫黛拉，黛拉・弗雷娅
I'm Della. Della Frye.

144
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,725
国会博客是我执笔的
I write the Capitol Hill blog.

145
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,960
好 网络部的
All right. Online side.

146
00:09:49,034 --> 00:09:51,025
我很欣赏你写的文章
I'm a big fan of your work.

147
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:57,031
我正在写一篇文章，是关于政界的…
So, I'm writing this piece on personal relationships

148
00:09:57,109 --> 00:09:58,599
私人关系
in the political sphere,

149
00:09:58,677 --> 00:10:01,271
“权力中央的单身女人” 类似那样的内容
"single girl in the corridors of power" kind of thing,

150
00:10:01,347 --> 00:10:03,110
也许你已经知道
and as you probably know,

151
00:10:03,182 --> 00:10:05,082
今早在你朋友的听证会上…
there was this incident this morning on the Hill,

152
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,174
所发生的小插曲
at your friend's hearing.

153
00:10:06,251 --> 00:10:08,583
你是不是有问题要问我？
Is there a question on the horizon?

154
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:13,524
没错，你今天联系过他吗？
Yeah. Have you spoken to him today?

155
00:10:14,326 --> 00:10:16,988
你想把我也扯进你的文章中吗？
Are you trying to make me part of your story?

156
00:10:17,062 --> 00:10:19,929
不是，我试图寻找背景材料
No. I'm trying to get a little context.

157
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:21,933
背景材料，回复：丑闻？
Context, re: Dirt?

158
00:10:23,969 --> 00:10:26,961
你觉得他和那女人有染吗？
Well, do you think he was having an affair with that girl?

159
00:10:27,573 --> 00:10:29,507
天啊，黛拉
Gee, Della.

160
00:10:30,042 --> 00:10:31,100
嗯
Yeah.

161
00:10:31,176 --> 00:10:34,145
我不知道，在下定论前
I don't know. I'd have to read a couple of blogs

162
00:10:34,213 --> 00:10:36,181
我得看几个博客
before I could form an opinion.

163
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,243
行，谢谢你的帮助
Okay. Thanks for your help.

<i>ANCHORMAN... The timing couldn't be worse for Collins.</i>

173

你是否和这个女人有染？
Were you having a relationship with this girl?

184
00:11:46,652 --> 00:11:47,710
是的
Yes,

185
00:11:48,353 --> 00:11:51,686
对于这一切，我十分抱歉
and I can't tell you how sorry I am about all of this.

186
00:11:52,658 --> 00:11:53,784
好
Okay.

187
00:11:54,893 --> 00:11:57,054
我请了安德鲁来帮我们…
I've asked Andrew here to help us

188

从媒体的角度处理事情
handle things from a media point of view.

189

如果有人能帮我们避过风头的话，那就是他了
If anyone can steer us through this, he can.

190
00:12:02,534 --> 00:12:05,435
接下来的72小时将会很残酷
Well, the next 72 hours are gonna be brutal.

191
00:12:05,504 --> 00:12:07,301
你要有心理准备
You ought to brace yourself for that.

192
00:12:07,372 --> 00:12:11,069
你将会暂时成为众矢之的 一切对政治的不满都会发泄到你身上
For a while, you're gonna be everything that's wrong with politics.

193
00:12:11,143 --> 00:12:13,270
史蒂夫，你依旧很优秀
You're still a star, Steve.

194
00:12:13,612 --> 00:12:15,705
党会帮助它的明星人物的
The party takes care of its stars.

195
00:12:15,848 --> 00:12:17,941
你只需暂时保持低姿态
You just have to lay low for a while.

196
00:12:18,484 --> 00:12:19,473
多低？
How low?

197
00:12:19,551 --> 00:12:20,677
很低
Low.

198
00:12:22,221 --> 00:12:25,952
任何引起对你高度关注的事都要避免
Nothing that would bring any undue attention to yourself.

199
00:12:26,892 --> 00:12:29,122
譬如说，听证会
At the hearings, for instance.

200
00:12:30,596 --> 00:12:32,325
我们还没有处理完“尖兵集团”的事宜
We're not finished with PointCorp.

201
00:12:32,464 --> 00:12:34,227
的确没有，但是你的任务结束了
No, but you are.

202
00:12:36,335 --> 00:12:38,963
如果你现在向那些人开火进攻的话
If you open up fire on those guys right now,

203
00:12:39,037 --> 00:12:40,937
那看上去不会像是你管理有方
that's not gonna look like good governance,

204
00:12:41,006 --> 00:12:43,668
反而只像是在蓄意分散公众注意力
just a calculated distraction.

205
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:48,273
你的妻子肯跟你讲话了吗？
Is your wife speaking to you?

206
00:12:49,114 --> 00:12:50,911
不，现在还不肯
No, not right now.

207
00:12:52,317 --> 00:12:54,444
那么你就有首要任务了，不是吗？
Then that's job one, isn't it?

208
00:12:59,558 --> 00:13:03,153
尹瑟！她知道你收到消息了
Yinzer! She knows you got the message,

209
00:13:03,295 --> 00:13:05,160
而且她知道你在
and she knows you're in the building.

210
00:13:07,266 --> 00:13:08,255
是的
Yes.

00:13:18,577 --> 00:13:19,601

Morning.

213
00:13:19,678 --> 00:13:22,408

So, where are we? Was he knobbing her or not?

214
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:24,573
早上好，卡姆
Morning, Cam.

215
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,414
你真的很滑稽，每次你的朋友竞选连任…
It's funny about you. Every time your friend runs for reelection

216
00:13:27,486 --> 00:13:28,714
或者是主持听证会
or conducts a hearing,

217
00:13:28,787 --> 00:13:31,278
你都是不断提及他的名字 直到我们肯报道他的消息
you drop his name to me until we give him some coverage.

218
00:13:31,356 --> 00:13:33,085
但是等到他终于做了件…
But he finally does something

219
00:13:33,225 --> 00:13:34,954
有望能提高报纸销量的事情
that actually might sell some newspapers,

220
00:13:35,027 --> 00:13:36,460
你却不说话了
you're rendered mute.

221
00:13:36,528 --> 00:13:37,961
前后太不一致了
It's incongruous.

222
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,156
不，不是这样的
No, it is not.

223
00:13:39,565 --> 00:13:41,157
是前后矛盾
It's inconsistent.

224
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,927
别给我耍滑头
(SCOFFS) Don't be an ass.

225
00:13:46,371 --> 00:13:48,066
你觉得如何？
What do you think?

226
00:13:48,207 --> 00:13:49,902

Those are the ideas for our facelift.

他觉得我们应该是盈利的
that we ought to be turning a profit.

230
00:13:59,418 --> 00:14:02,444
是的，呃，我听说我们的网络部成绩不错
Yeah, well, I hear our online side is doing great.

231
00:14:02,521 --> 00:14:03,783
我不是那种会注意…
I mean, not like I'm the kind of guy

232
00:14:03,922 --> 00:14:05,184
那类事情的人
who would notice that sort of thing,

233
00:14:05,257 --> 00:14:08,283
但是，我在这待了，多少，15年？
but I've been here, what, 15 years?

I use a 16-year-old computer.

她来这里15分钟
She's been here 15 minutes,

236
00:14:12,164 --> 00:14:14,689
而她拥有的装备可以用来发射俄罗斯卫星
and she could launch a Russian satellite with the gear she's got.

237
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:16,996
没错，她告诉我你很让人讨厌，就像猪一样
Yeah, she told me you behaved like a pig.

238
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:18,297
这话有点过
That's too strong.

239
00:14:18,437 --> 00:14:19,699
呃，讨厌兮兮的
Well, piggish.

240
00:14:20,372 --> 00:14:22,499
我只是给她看了我的猪鼻子
I showed her a little snout.

241
00:14:24,309 --> 00:14:27,745
碰巧我很喜欢黛拉・弗雷娅小姐
Well, I happen to like Ms. Della Frye.

242
00:14:27,813 --> 00:14:29,508
而且，没错，的确是我派她去…
And, yes, I did send her down there

243
00:14:29,648 --> 00:14:31,377
你那打探点消息的
to winkle something out of you.

244
00:14:32,451 --> 00:14:35,511
她欲求强烈，对工资要求不高 但是她却能每个小时都发稿
She's hungry, she's cheap, and she churns out copy every hour.

245
00:14:35,587 --> 00:14:39,216
是的，我知道，我只会坐等 薪水高，而且效率低下
Yeah, I know. I'm overfed, I'm too expensive, and I take way too long.

246
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,417
是的，确实如此
Yes, you do.

247
00:14:40,492 --> 00:14:43,757
我曾是史蒂芬・柯林斯的大学舍友
I was Stephen Collins' roommate in college.

248
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:45,854
但我现在不和他住在一起
I don't live with him now.

249
00:14:45,931 --> 00:14:47,262
那很可惜，不是吗？
Well, that's a shame, isn't it?

250
00:14:47,332 --> 00:14:49,994
是啊，那我和他的绯闻就能提升报纸销量了
Yeah, 'cause that could sell some newspapers.

00:16:23,395 --> 00:16:26,387
是啊，我把那张沙发移了几英尺
Yeah. I moved that couch a couple of feet.

272
00:16:26,465 --> 00:16:27,830
看着不错
Looks good.

273
00:16:30,802 --> 00:16:33,635
你不打算问我怎么会这么愚蠢吗？
Aren't you gonna ask me how I could be so stupid?

274
00:16:33,705 --> 00:16:35,400
- 马上就问 - 好的
In a minute. Okay.

275
00:16:40,145 --> 00:16:44,138
在过去的三年里，我与别人合作提交两份议案
You know, I co-sponsored two bills in the last three years.

276
00:16:44,216 --> 00:16:46,309
我正和同事起草另一份议案
I'm in the middle of co-authoring another one,

277
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:49,286
而这份议案也将让我名垂青史
and this is what I'm gonna be remembered for.

278
00:16:49,788 --> 00:16:51,255
我这次得到的曝光率将比…
I'm gonna get more coverage on this

279
00:16:51,356 --> 00:16:53,950
我余生所做的任何事情都要多
than anything else I do for the rest of my life.

280
00:16:55,027 --> 00:16:58,121
公职就是这样的
The nature of the beast, public office.

281
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:05,461
好吧
Okay.

282
00:17:10,542 --> 00:17:11,941
听着卡尔
Look, Cal,

283
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:16,306
我知道上次见面我说了些不该说的
I know the last time I saw you, I said a few things.

284
00:17:16,381 --> 00:17:17,473
嘿
Hey.

285
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:21,615
是我活该，都怪我自己
I deserved it, all of it.

286
00:17:24,356 --> 00:17:28,087
很显然，安妮和我的婚姻出现了些问题
Annie and I were having problems in the marriage, obviously.

287
00:17:33,465 --> 00:17:35,865
你是我唯一的真朋友
You're the only real friend I got.

288
00:17:37,502 --> 00:17:39,231
兄弟，我现在惹上大麻烦了
I'm in trouble, man.

289
00:17:41,139 --> 00:17:42,470
你知道吗？
You know?

290
00:17:43,075 --> 00:17:47,705
关于索尼娅的整件事情 所发生的一切，都让我措手不及
This whole thing with Sonia, what happened, it just snuck up on me.

291
00:17:49,381 --> 00:17:51,406
她是个很了不起的女人
She was an amazing woman,

292
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:55,408
美丽，风趣，聪明
beautiful and really funny, smart,

293
00:17:56,721 --> 00:17:59,451
而且她，她，很崇拜我
and she, you know, she adored me.

294
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:04,823
那种感觉非常好，是我从来没有体会过的
That was nice, you know, for a change.

295
00:18:10,435 --> 00:18:12,403
你给她父母打电话了吗？
Have you called the parents?

296
00:18:12,471 --> 00:18:16,134
没有，我没有打给她父母
(SIGHS) No, I haven't called the parents.

297
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,505
你应该打
You should.

298
00:18:17,576 --> 00:18:19,908
明天你打个吊唁电话
Tomorrow, you're gonna make a condolence call.

299
00:18:19,978 --> 00:18:22,503
否则最先引起那些攻击者注意的会是…
The first thing the attack dogs will pick up on, you know,

300
00:18:22,581 --> 00:18:26,210
“我们女儿自杀之后 他甚至连电话都没有打一个”
"He never so much as called after our daughter's suicide."

301
00:18:30,021 --> 00:18:32,012
她不是自杀
She didn't kill herself.

302
00:18:33,391 --> 00:18:35,154
你怎么知道的？
How do you know that?

303
00:18:42,467 --> 00:18:47,598
“嘿，亲爱的，祝你好运 给他们点颜色瞧瞧
<i>Hey, baby, I just want to wish you good luck. I want you to give them hell,</i>

304
00:18:49,307 --> 00:18:51,036
“我很期待周末
<i>and I can't wait for this weekend.</i>

305
00:18:51,176 --> 00:18:52,939
“我爱你，再见”
<i>I love you. Bye.</i>

306
00:18:54,379 --> 00:18:56,279
那是今天早上的
That's this morning.

307
00:18:56,348 --> 00:18:59,476
看上去像一个准备自杀的人吗？
Look like someone who's about to go out and commit suicide?

308
00:18:59,551 --> 00:19:00,609
不像
No.

309
00:19:03,321 --> 00:19:04,447
这个你给其他人看过吗？
You show this to anybody?

310
00:19:04,523 --> 00:19:06,514
是啊，我还想过在YouTube上发布呢
Well, I thought about firing it up on YouTube.

311
00:19:06,591 --> 00:19:08,058
知道吗？
Hey, you know what?

312
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,721
现在我要问你，你到底能愚蠢到什么程度
This is the moment where I ask you how stupid could you be.

313
00:19:11,796 --> 00:19:13,661
这能改变一切
This changes everything.

314
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:15,663
我们要把一切争取回来
It'll bring it all back your way.

315
00:19:15,734 --> 00:19:16,996
你打算怎么做？
How are you gonna do that?

316
00:19:17,068 --> 00:19:20,128
我们要用事实回击
Because we're gonna fight back with our own facts.

317
00:19:20,205 --> 00:19:21,832
我们所要做的就是编造一个…
All we have to do is, we have to build

318
00:19:21,907 --> 00:19:24,933
合理的故事，明白吗？
a plausible alternative story, all right?

319
00:19:26,912 --> 00:19:28,243
听着
Now, look.

320

"Unfortunately, it appears that Sonia Baker

- 行吗？ - 卡尔
Okay? Cal.

324
00:19:44,462 --> 00:19:45,759
听着，史蒂芬
Now, Stephen,

325
00:19:46,965 --> 00:19:49,331
你必须采取主动，明白吗？
you gotta be proactive, okay?

326
00:19:49,401 --> 00:19:51,961
否则，你就是给那些吸血鬼…
If you're not, then you're just letting the bloodsuckers

327
00:19:52,037 --> 00:19:54,062
和写博客的随意攻击的机会
and the bloggers have another free shot at you.

00:23:45,603 --> 00:23:47,093
稍等 他就在这
Yeah, just a sec. He's right here.

406
00:23:47,238 --> 00:23:48,728
等下，等下，等下
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

407
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:52,536
是安妮・柯林斯的电话
It's Anne Collins.

408
00:23:55,613 --> 00:23:58,878
嘿，我现在不在自己的办公桌旁 能不能一会打给你？
Hey, I'm not at my desk at the moment. Can I call you back?

409
00:23:59,384 --> 00:24:00,544
好的
Yeah.

410
00:24:01,886 --> 00:24:04,946
查一下那两起推挤落轨事件
You know, look into the two psycho-on-stranger cases,

411
00:24:05,023 --> 00:24:07,218
看看有没有联系
see if anything correlates or anything connects.

412
00:24:07,325 --> 00:24:08,314
嗯
Mmm-hmm.

413
00:24:09,894 --> 00:24:11,452
(PHONE RINGING)

414
00:24:17,068 --> 00:24:18,797
- 喂？ - 嘿
<i>Hello? CAL... Hey.</i>

415
00:24:19,737 --> 00:24:21,227
- 你还好吗？ - 不
<i>You okay? No.</i>

416
00:24:22,474 --> 00:24:23,839
我的草坪上有很多狗仔队
There are paparazzi on my lawn,

417
00:24:23,908 --> 00:24:27,571
我猜我离上“美国周刊”不远了
<i>so I guess that entitles me to half off on Us Weekly.</i>

418
00:24:29,514 --> 00:24:30,776
我一直试着打你电话
I've been trying to call you.

419
00:24:31,983 --> 00:24:33,712
我关机了
I had my phone off.

420
00:24:34,486 --> 00:24:35,953
你和史蒂芬谈过了吗？
<i>You talk to Stephen yet?</i>

421
00:24:36,087 --> 00:24:37,554
还没
No.

422
00:24:39,657 --> 00:24:42,592
他们要我下去召开记者招待会
They want me to come down for a press conference.

423
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:46,152
如果你不这么做，他们会把他送上刑场的
Well, you know if you don't, they're gonna toss him on the bonfire.

424
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:49,460
我并没有很受伤的感觉
You know, I'm not that hurt.

425
00:24:49,601 --> 00:24:51,296
我甚至都不觉得太惊讶
I'm not even that surprised.

426
00:24:53,204 --> 00:24:55,502
只是实在是太丢人了
It's just so humiliating, you know.

427
00:24:55,807 --> 00:24:56,796
<i>(SIGHING)</i>

428
00:24:58,409 --> 00:24:59,433
告诉我你不知道她的存在
Tell me you didn't know about her.

429
00:24:59,511 --> 00:25:00,603
我不知道…
I didn't.

430
00:25:00,678 --> 00:25:02,669
我不知道她，知道吗？
I did not know about her, okay?

431
00:25:04,215 --> 00:25:05,409
我一会乘列车去你那
<i>I'll take the train down.</i>

432
00:25:06,551 --> 00:25:08,542
然后你能不能请我喝酒？
Will you buy me a drink after?

433
00:25:09,954 --> 00:25:13,754
没问题，嘿，给他打个电话，好吗？
Of course. Hey, just call him, all right?

434
00:25:13,825 --> 00:25:15,520
给史蒂芬打个电话
<i>Just call Stephen.</i>

435
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,355
谢谢
Thanks.

436
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,667
德尚・斯塔格
CAL: Deshaun Stagg.

437
00:25:30,808 --> 00:25:32,469
如果他们能把他的名字拼对就好了
Be nice if they could spell his name right.

438
00:25:32,544 --> 00:25:34,068
到现在还没有人来领他的东西
No one's even come to get his stuff yet.

439
00:25:34,212 --> 00:25:35,770
令人发指
It's appalling.

440
00:25:35,847 --> 00:25:37,712
这事从来不会发生在白人身上
Never happen to a white man.

441
00:25:37,782 --> 00:25:39,750
闭嘴 我没那个心情
Skip it. I'm not in the mood.

442
00:25:39,817 --> 00:25:41,580
怎么，不准谈爱，不准谈政治？
What, no love, no politics?

443
00:25:41,719 --> 00:25:43,482
那我们谈什么？
What are we gonna talk about?

444
00:25:43,555 --> 00:25:45,182
我们不谈 你赶紧离开这
We're not. You gotta get out of here

445
00:25:45,323 --> 00:25:46,984
免得我们都惹上麻烦
before we both get into trouble.

446
00:25:48,793 --> 00:25:50,988
他们说只有一个枪手，你怎么认为的？
They're saying it was only one shooter. What do you think?

447
00:25:51,062 --> 00:25:52,290
不清楚
No idea.

448
00:25:54,198 --> 00:25:55,756
毒品呢？
What about drugs?

449
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,492
很有可能
It's a good bet.

450
00:25:58,269 --> 00:26:00,169
得了卡尔 别去碰那堆东西
Come on, Cal, leave that shit alone.

451
00:26:00,238 --> 00:26:02,866
眼睛闭起来，我只是在看他的手机
Close your eyes. I'm just checking out his cell phone.

452
00:26:04,442 --> 00:26:06,205
小心，这个钟点可能正是他们…
(SIGHING) Watch, this will be the moment they decide

453
00:26:06,344 --> 00:26:08,107
来把这些东西取走的时候
to come and pick all this shit up.

454
00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:10,272
那样的话你会怎么办？
Then what are you gonna do?

455
00:26:10,415 --> 00:26:12,542
写些文章，就可以帮我保住饭碗吗？
Write some articles, get me my job back?

456
00:26:12,617 --> 00:26:14,209
你知道我会这么做的
You know I will.

457
00:26:14,586 --> 00:26:15,814
卡尔？
Cal?

458
00:26:17,322 --> 00:26:20,155
卡尔，老天啊 如果杰克进来我怎么向他解释？
Cal, for Christ's sakes, what do I tell Jack if he walks in?

459
00:26:20,224 --> 00:26:22,192
不必解释，因为我搞定了
Nothing, 'cause I'm done.

460
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,498
下次我会给你一个拥抱，好吗？
I'll give you a hug next time, all right?

461
00:26:30,234 --> 00:26:31,292
再见
Bye.

462
00:26:37,909 --> 00:26:39,570
给我买瓶汽水？
Buy me a soda?

463
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,108
不要健怡的
Not diet.

464
00:26:54,892 --> 00:26:56,052
谢谢
Thanks.

We got any kind of drug angle on her?

So are you trying to ruin what's left of her reputation?

I'm sorry.

521
00:31:10,448 --> 00:31:12,575
声明不用很详细的
It doesn't have to be a detailed statement.

522
00:31:12,717 --> 00:31:15,652
简单而庄重，我们就可以离开了
Short and dignified, and we'll be out of here.

523
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,450

Dignified. Got it.

<i>MAN... Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us here today.</i>

<i>Mr. And Mrs. Collins would like to give you a brief statement.</i>

526
00:31:49,987 --> 00:31:52,683
德尚是从星巴克咖啡馆的一个男人…
GIRL: Deshaun boosted this metal briefcase

527
00:31:52,823 --> 00:31:55,519
男人那偷来这个铁皮公文包的
from some guy outside of Starbucks.

528
00:31:56,394 --> 00:31:58,624
那就是我们的活
That's what we did, you know?

529
00:31:59,997 --> 00:32:03,398
偷别人的包然后再卖给他
Grab a guy's bag and sell it back to him.

530
00:32:08,272 --> 00:32:12,265
通常包里只装些商业文件和其他东西
Usually we just got, like, people's business papers and shit.

531
00:32:13,244 --> 00:32:16,145
而这个？ 这个不一样
This one? This one was different.

532
00:32:46,978 --> 00:32:49,276
包里还有一把枪
GIRL: There was a gun in there, too,

533
00:32:49,847 --> 00:32:53,305
还有一小包看上去很奇怪的子弹
and a little bag of these weird-looking bullets.

534
00:32:54,785 --> 00:32:56,184
你看到过这个包的主人吗？
Did you see the guy that owned the bag?

535
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,719
没有
No.

536
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:03,857
我告诉过德尚不应该把这包卖回去的
I told Deshaun we shouldn't sell this bag back.

537
00:33:04,395 --> 00:33:06,192
我想那女人该怎么办？
I mean, you know, what about the girl?

538
00:33:06,263 --> 00:33:09,630
但是他毒瘾上来了
But he needed a fix real bad,

539
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:14,262
于是就和这个人商定了时间和地点
and he and this guy figured out a time and place.

540
00:33:14,338 --> 00:33:16,135
然后就是这样子
And that was it.

541
00:33:19,377 --> 00:33:21,345
他一去不复返
My boy never came back.

542
00:33:22,113 --> 00:33:24,673
你事先把这些从公文包里拿了出来
You took these out of the briefcase first,

543
00:33:25,316 --> 00:33:27,546
然后你用德尚的手机给她打了电话
and then you called her from Deshaun's phone.

544
00:33:27,618 --> 00:33:29,609
她的号码也在文件里
Her number was there, too.

545
00:33:30,221 --> 00:33:32,189
我认为她有必要知道
I figured someone had to warn her

546
00:33:32,256 --> 00:33:34,520
有个变态在跟踪她
that this psycho was following her around.

547
00:33:36,093 --> 00:33:38,027
只是她没有接电话
She just didn't pick up.

548
00:33:38,796 --> 00:33:41,162
柯林斯先生采取行动…
<i>Mr. Collins moved to staunch a growing tide</i>

549
00:33:41,298 --> 00:33:43,698
来控制日渐增长的反对呼声
<i>of hostility towards him this afternoon</i>

550
00:33:43,768 --> 00:33:45,201
他于今日下午现身，携同…
<i>when he appeared together with his...</i>

551
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:46,793
…世代都嫁给了政客
<i>... the long line of politicians' wives.</i>

552
00:33:46,871 --> 00:33:49,567
我们有过成功，也有过失败
<i>We've had triumphs and disappointments,</i>

553
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,108
我们俩都犯过错误以致于…
<i>and we've both made mistakes that have caused...</i>

554
00:33:52,176 --> 00:33:56,909
要为他的婚外情道歉，向他的宣选民道歉
<i>MAN... apologize for his affair and offer an apology to his constituents.</i>

555
00:33:56,981 --> 00:33:58,380
你能相信吗？
Can you believe this?

556
00:33:58,449 --> 00:34:00,212
有六个台同时在播我们的声明
We're on six channels simultaneously.

557
00:34:00,718 --> 00:34:03,084
卡尔…有谁会希望索尼娅死？
<i>CAL... Who might have wanted Sonia dead?</i>

558
00:34:04,121 --> 00:34:05,850
- 什么？ - 关于她的过去…
<i>What? Is there something in her history,</i>

559
00:34:05,923 --> 00:34:07,117
你是否对我有所隐瞒？
you know, something you haven't told me about?

560
00:34:07,191 --> 00:34:10,126
像是一些令她深陷泥潭的关系？
Some connections that might have got her in trouble?

561
00:34:10,194 --> 00:34:13,960
不，没有，没有，等一下，我这是…
No. No, no. Wait, who...

562
00:34:14,031 --> 00:34:15,020
我是在和我的朋友说话…
Am I talking to my friend now,

563
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:16,190
还是和一个记者？
or am I talking to a reporter?

564
00:34:18,936 --> 00:34:20,528
两者都是
I gotta be both.

565
00:34:20,604 --> 00:34:23,004
你听说过一个叫德尚・斯塔格的人吗？
<i>You ever heard of a guy called Deshaun Stagg?</i>

566
00:34:23,074 --> 00:34:24,063
没有
No.

567
00:34:24,141 --> 00:34:25,733
是个小毛孩，街头毛贼
Was a kid. Minor criminal.

568
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:29,541
嗜毒，索尼娅死的前一晚被枪杀了
Drug addict. Got shot and killed the night before Sonia died.

569
00:34:29,613 --> 00:34:31,877
卡尔，索尼娅从来不吸毒
Cal, Sonia didn't have anything to do with drugs.

570
00:34:32,783 --> 00:34:34,842
听着，史蒂芬，这些事情…
Look, Stephen, I'm telling you things

571
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:36,910
我还没有和报社谈过
that I haven't even discussed with the paper.

572
00:34:36,987 --> 00:34:38,955
好吗，你要好好想想
Okay, you gotta think about this.

573
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:41,058
谁有可能想置索尼娅于死地？
Who might have wanted Sonia dead?

574
00:34:57,508 --> 00:35:01,410
这个男人在每张她哭泣的照片中都出现 他是谁？
CHRIS: Who is this man here in all the photographs where she's crying?

575
00:35:01,479 --> 00:35:03,344
我们还不清楚
CAL: We don't know that yet.

576
00:35:04,682 --> 00:35:08,311
她在和柯林斯共事之前是做什么的？
And what was her background before she started working with Collins?

577
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,411
从她的简历上看，很乱
DELLA: Well, she has some very random moments in her résumé.

578
00:35:11,489 --> 00:35:13,889
她曾经… 她做过几份服务员的工作
She was... She waitressed a couple times.

579
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:15,949
她有许多坏账
She had a string of bad debts.

580
00:35:16,093 --> 00:35:18,118
两年前入店行窃被叛罪
Shoplifting conviction two years ago.

581
00:35:18,195 --> 00:35:20,163
国会难道不调查雇员背景吗？
Don't they do background checks on the Hill?

582
00:35:20,231 --> 00:35:22,222
她替柯林斯写了有关银行规范…
DELLA: She wrote position papers for Collins

583
00:35:22,366 --> 00:35:24,391
和证券交易委员会的意见书
about bank regulations and the SEC.

584
00:35:24,468 --> 00:35:26,402
很多人都觉得她很有才华
I mean, a lot of people thought she was a star.

585
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:30,406
同时她还是针对“尖兵集团”的听证会的 首席研究员
She was also the lead researcher on the PointCorp hearings.

586
00:35:31,175 --> 00:35:32,335
那又怎样？
CAMERON: So?

587
00:35:34,278 --> 00:35:38,078
史蒂芬会让那些人损失很多钱
Stephen represents the loss of a lot of money for those guys.

588
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:43,208
听着，如果这些一切只是…
Look, what if all of this is just an attempt

589
00:35:43,287 --> 00:35:45,050
为了排挤史蒂芬・柯林斯，会怎样？
to marginalize Stephen Collins?

590
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:48,487
你能说出这样的话，一定很爱他，对吧？
CAMERON: You've gotta love him for it, haven't you?

591
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:51,790
给他24小时和一具小巷里的尸体
I mean, you give him 24 hours, body in the alley,

592
00:35:51,862 --> 00:35:53,523
这个老头就能编出一个…
and this geezer will turn it into

593
00:35:53,664 --> 00:35:55,325
有模有样的集团阴谋
a full-blown corporate conspiracy.

594
00:35:55,399 --> 00:35:56,525
你看不到关联吗？
You don't see any connection?

595
00:35:56,667 --> 00:35:57,827
看不到
No.

596
00:35:58,369 --> 00:36:00,530
那好吧，我们现在整理一下我们知道的情报 好吗？
All right. Let's go through what we know, okay?

597
00:36:00,604 --> 00:36:03,402
那个尾随索尼娅・贝克的男人
The guy that was stalking Sonia Baker,

598
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:06,339
枪杀了德尚・斯塔格 和弗农・桑杜
he shot Deshaun Stagg and Vernon Sando.

599
00:36:07,912 --> 00:36:11,678
德尚・斯塔格没有固定居所 他偷了一个文件包
Deshaun Stagg, of no fixed abode, he boosts a briefcase.

600
00:36:11,749 --> 00:36:14,411
那个文件包里装着这些照片
Now, in that briefcase are these photographs,

601
00:36:14,485 --> 00:36:18,478
据知线人所说 还装着一小包奇怪的子弹
and according to our source, a little baggie of weird bullets.

602
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:21,021
地铁警局的弹道分析结果显示
Metro PD ballistics tell me

603
00:36:21,091 --> 00:36:24,857
犯罪现场的弹壳是被二次使用的 我们无法追踪
the casings at the crime scene were reloads, untraceable.

604
00:36:25,729 --> 00:36:30,029
子弹比普通商店里买的重两倍， 是手动发射的
The slugs were hand cast at twice the weight of store-bought bullets,

605
00:36:30,868 --> 00:36:32,358
是扩散型的
X'ed for expansion.

606
00:36:32,436 --> 00:36:35,166
也就是说杀手想置人于死地
So that means that the shooter intended to kill.

607
00:36:36,807 --> 00:36:39,002
斯塔格和桑杜都连挨两枪
Stagg and Sando were both double-tapped,

608
00:36:39,076 --> 00:36:41,704
一颗子弹在脊椎，另一颗在头部 这是职业杀手的做法
one bullet in the spine, one in the head. That is the mark of a pro,

609
00:36:41,779 --> 00:36:44,771
或者至少也是当过兵的
or at the very least, somebody with a military background,

610
00:36:44,882 --> 00:36:46,873
甚至有可能是特种部队的
perhaps even Special Forces.

611
00:36:47,418 --> 00:36:53,414
“尖兵集团”的建立者和雇员 全都是当过兵的人
PointCorp founded by, staffed by 100./. Ex-military.

612
00:36:56,093 --> 00:36:58,653
我觉得这是我们不能忽视的关联
I think that's a connection we can't ignore.

613
00:37:02,566 --> 00:37:05,399
克里斯，我们最迟什么时候移交证据？
Chris, how long before we have to hand these over?

614
00:37:06,537 --> 00:37:08,971
确认，查询相关的档案…
CHRIS: Time to verify, consult relevant case files,

615
00:37:09,106 --> 00:37:11,540
外部法律顾问 加起来最多48小时
outside counsel, 48 hours, tops.

616
00:37:13,444 --> 00:37:16,777
但如果这就是证据 不应该现在就给他警方吗？
But if this is evidence, don't they need to see it now?

617
00:37:27,558 --> 00:37:29,048
他怎么样了？
How's he doing?

618
00:37:47,978 --> 00:37:49,843
嘿，如果要确认身份，你会通知我的 对吗？
Hey, you gonna let me know if I gotta call the ID team, right?

619
00:37:49,913 --> 00:37:51,244
我会通知你的
NURSE: I'll let you know.

620
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,954
沃特・什洛亚，你那好色的朋友的战友…
Walter Schroyer, Army buddy of your libidinous friend,

621
00:38:00,024 --> 00:38:02,288
在那篇蹩脚的文章里对史蒂芬・柯林斯
gives his moving tribute to Stephen Collins

622
00:38:02,359 --> 00:38:05,351
进行了高度的赞扬，为什么不是我们？
in that asswipe excuse of a paper and not to us. Why?

623
00:38:05,352 --> 00:38:07,252
史蒂芬・柯林斯是那种你想
CAL: Platitudes, padding and fluff.

624
00:38:05,829 --> 00:38:08,764
陈词滥调 都是充字数的

625
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:11,392
我是记者，不是广告员
I'm a journalist. I'm not a publicist.

626
00:38:11,468 --> 00:38:12,799
我想再叫些人…
CAMERON: I want to bring some more people in

627
00:38:12,936 --> 00:38:14,267
和你一起工作，卡尔
to work with you on this, Cal,

628
00:38:14,338 --> 00:38:17,307
写政治新闻的，有实战经验的人
on the political side, people with real experience.

629
00:38:17,374 --> 00:38:18,739
我在考虑泰德・穆迪
I'm thinking Ted Moody.

630
00:38:18,876 --> 00:38:20,241
泰德再合适不过了
I mean, Ted's perfect for this.

631
00:38:20,311 --> 00:38:22,836
你不想让我插手了吗？
Are you taking me off the story?

632
00:38:22,913 --> 00:38:25,905
不，不是 不是不插手，只是做二线
No, no. Not off, just off point.

633
00:38:25,983 --> 00:38:28,213
如果这件事情真像他说过的那样 “如果”是真的
If this is as big as he says it is, a big "if,"

634
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:30,616
那么这对你来说是有好处的
then it's gonna be good for you.

635
00:38:30,688 --> 00:38:32,656
那，那有什么好的？
How? How is that good?

636
00:38:32,723 --> 00:38:34,418
观察资深记者…
Well, watching seasoned reporters

637
00:38:34,558 --> 00:38:36,253
调查新闻
that work on a big story, you know,

638
00:38:36,327 --> 00:38:37,954
并且参与其中，你会学到很多东西的
being a part of it all, you'll learn a lot.

639
00:38:38,095 --> 00:38:39,756
泰德・穆迪，你意下如何？
So, Ted Moody, what do you think?

640
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:40,956
不要让她插手
Don't let her do it.

641
00:38:41,031 --> 00:38:44,467
卡尔，你要调查的话 我希望你不要被私人关系束缚
And, Cal, if you're on this, I want this to be clean through and through.

642
00:38:44,535 --> 00:38:46,503
跟她说别想了 这是你的舞会
Tell her to forget it. It's your gig.

643
00:38:46,637 --> 00:38:48,628
你能行的，欢呼吧
You got it. Get loud now.

644
00:38:49,206 --> 00:38:50,696
不好意思，你现在是在替她说话吗？
Excuse me. You're defending her now?

645
00:38:50,774 --> 00:38:53,072
她很好，我可以和她共事
She's fine. I can work with her.

646
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:55,669
但是，卡尔，她没有经验
But, Cal, she's inexperienced.

647
00:38:55,746 --> 00:38:56,872
没有经验不要紧
Inexperience isn't fatal.

648
00:38:56,947 --> 00:38:59,074
我不会半途而废的！
I'm not giving up the story!

649
00:39:00,684 --> 00:39:03,244
我…对不起，我只是…
I just... Sorry. I just...

650
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,380
再给我几天时间
If I could just have a few more days with it,

651
00:39:06,457 --> 00:39:09,255
我保证不会让你失望
I promise you I'm not gonna let you down.

652
00:39:12,029 --> 00:39:13,758
看在上帝份上
For Christ's sake.

653
00:39:15,132 --> 00:39:17,464
不要像个新人记者那样泪汪汪的看着我
Don't throw those dewy cub reporter eyes at me.

654
00:39:17,534 --> 00:39:18,626
有点恶心
It's nauseating.

655
00:39:22,373 --> 00:39:23,499
谢你全家
And fuck you very much.

656
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,766
不客气
Pleasure.

657
00:39:26,977 --> 00:39:28,877
这是丽芙护士和我… 化验结果出来了
This is Nurse Leif and myself... The lab work's back.

658
00:39:28,946 --> 00:39:30,413
是你要求的13小组？
It's the panel 13 you ordered?

659
00:39:30,481 --> 00:39:32,972
我们半小时之前就打电话给神经科医师了
Yeah, well, we called for a neurologist a half hour ago.

660
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:35,648
先生，你不能在这里用手机
You can't use that phone here, sir.

661
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:38,085
嘿，什么事，卡恩斯？ 你怎么样？
Hey. What's up, Carnes? How you doing?

662
00:39:38,856 --> 00:39:39,880
没错，没错
Yeah. Yeah.

663
00:39:40,023 --> 00:39:41,081
那个叫桑杜的人似乎快醒了
Looks like that Sando guy's waking up.

664
00:39:41,525 --> 00:39:42,822
你要派人过来吗？
You sending anyone over?

665
00:39:49,466 --> 00:39:50,455
你以前去过华盛顿医院吗？
You ever been to D.C. Hospital?

666
00:39:50,601 --> 00:39:51,625
没有
No.

667
00:39:51,702 --> 00:39:53,465
别担心，很简单的
Don't worry about it. It's easy.

668
00:39:53,537 --> 00:39:56,597
三楼重症监护室那有一个穿制服的警察
CAL: All right, there's a uniformed officer on the third floor ICU.

669
00:39:56,673 --> 00:39:58,538
- 好的 - 记下来，有笔吗？
Okay. Write it down. Got a pen?

670
00:39:58,609 --> 00:39:59,667
- 有的 - 给
Yes. Here.

671
00:39:59,743 --> 00:40:01,176
- 我有笔的 - 好的
I have a pen. Okay.

672
00:40:01,245 --> 00:40:03,907
那个穿制服的警察叫布朗
The uniformed officer's name is Brown.

673
00:40:04,014 --> 00:40:05,038
- 记下了吗？ - 布朗
Okay. Brown.

674
00:40:05,115 --> 00:40:08,482
三楼重症监护室 告诉他拜恩斯探员…
Third floor ICU. Tell him that Detective Bynes,

675
00:40:08,552 --> 00:40:09,712
B-Y-N-E-S，乔・拜恩斯…
B-Y-N-E-S, Joe Bynes...

676
00:40:09,853 --> 00:40:11,013
好的
Okay.

677
00:40:11,088 --> 00:40:12,680
好了，拜恩斯让你通行的
All right, he cleared you for access.

678
00:40:12,823 --> 00:40:14,450
通行去哪里？
Access for what?

679
00:40:15,325 --> 00:40:18,624
弗农・桑杜，卖批萨的那个人 似乎他快醒了
Vernon Sando, the pizza guy, looks like he's coming around.

680
00:40:18,695 --> 00:40:20,424
那是你负责的部分
That's your side of the story.

681
00:40:20,497 --> 00:40:21,794
你说什么？
Excuse me?

682
00:40:21,932 --> 00:40:23,229
你听到我说的了
You heard me.

683
00:40:24,001 --> 00:40:26,834
你要我坐在医院里…
You want me to go and sit around in some hospital,

684
00:40:26,904 --> 00:40:30,465
等一个有可能从昏迷中苏醒的人
waiting for a guy who looks like he might be coming out of a coma,

685
00:40:30,541 --> 00:40:33,237
而你就可以把其他部分都清理掉？
while you clean up the rest of the story?

686
00:40:33,777 --> 00:40:36,678
我说，你所有的目的就是这个？
I mean, is that what that was all about in there?

687
00:40:36,747 --> 00:40:40,478
听着，这是真实事件
Look, this is a real story.

688
00:40:40,551 --> 00:40:42,314
真相只有一个
It's not open for interpretation.

689
00:40:42,453 --> 00:40:44,250
不能妄加猜测
It does not require opinion.

690
00:40:44,321 --> 00:40:47,381
两具尸体，还有一个人昏迷
We got two dead bodies, and we got a guy in a coma,

691
00:40:48,225 --> 00:40:50,022
而我们先人一步掌握一条线索
and we got us with a lead that nobody else has got.

692
00:40:50,093 --> 00:40:51,219
我们必须作出决定
So you gotta make a decision,

693
00:40:51,295 --> 00:40:52,956
因为今晚我还要追踪另一条线索
because I have to follow another lead tonight,

694
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,726
而我不会分身术
and I cannot be in two places at one time.

695
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,333
所以，你今天晚上将就一下守在医院
So, are you gonna be okay slumming it

696
00:40:58,402 --> 00:41:00,597
看看弗农・桑杜会不会醒过来，行吗？
to find out if Vernon Sando's coming around or not?

697
00:41:03,874 --> 00:41:05,034
好的
Good.

698
00:41:05,776 --> 00:41:10,304
如果我们要共事的话，我们就必须合作
If we're gonna work together, we gotta work together.

699
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,075
好吗？说定了？
Yeah? Deal?

700
00:41:18,889 --> 00:41:20,857
好了，一会见
All right, see you later.

701
00:41:27,831 --> 00:41:28,820
(CROWD CHATTERING)

702
00:42:07,571 --> 00:42:08,902
抱歉
Excuse me.

703
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,045
别跟我说你还找不到路
Don't tell me you're still lost.

704
00:42:26,123 --> 00:42:27,750
嘿，你在这干什么？
Hey, what are you doing here?

705
00:42:27,891 --> 00:42:29,518
工作
Working.

706
00:42:30,861 --> 00:42:32,590
你是布朗警官？
You're Officer Brown?

707
00:42:33,297 --> 00:42:35,356
你就是我要找的人
You're who I'm looking for.

708
00:42:35,432 --> 00:42:37,491
我知道你会回来的
(CHUCKLING) I knew you'd come around.

709
00:42:38,001 --> 00:42:40,265
桑杜怎么样了？ 他醒了吗？
(CELL PHONE RINGING) How about Sando? Is he coming around?

710
00:42:40,337 --> 00:42:42,498
是，是的，看上去快醒了
Yeah, yeah, it looks that way.

711
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:44,834
他们现在派了一个警探过来
They're sending a detective over right now.

712
00:42:44,908 --> 00:42:46,170
也需要确认一下身份
Maybe get an ID.

713
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:47,572
真的？
Really?

714
00:42:48,612 --> 00:42:49,874
这电话我得接
I gotta take this.

715
00:42:50,013 --> 00:42:51,275
哦，接吧
Yeah, go ahead.

716
00:42:51,348 --> 00:42:53,179
我是布朗警官
Yeah, Officer Brown.

717
00:42:55,018 --> 00:42:56,076
没有，先生
No, sir.

718
00:42:56,887 --> 00:42:58,286
你好吗？
You okay?

719
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:03,086
我爸爸曾经劝过我要小心政客
My dad did warn me about politicians.

720
00:43:04,061 --> 00:43:08,054
比起政客，他更讨厌记者
The only people he hated more was journalists.

721
00:43:10,334 --> 00:43:11,824
他很明智
Smart man.

722
00:43:15,238 --> 00:43:16,899
我让你紧张了
I'm making you nervous.

723
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,735
你一向如此
You always did.

724
00:43:20,877 --> 00:43:23,710
有人说性是友谊的克星
Well, they say sex is the best way to ruin a friendship.

725
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,839
有人这么说？ 是谁？
They do, do they? And who's they?

726
00:43:25,983 --> 00:43:29,510
大都会杂志？青春悸动？
<i>What, Cosmopolitan magazine? Teen Beat?</i>

727
00:43:29,653 --> 00:43:30,745
得了
Come on.

728
00:43:31,922 --> 00:43:34,117
告诉我，我们的友谊没有被性影响
Tell me, please, it didn't ruin ours.

729
00:43:34,257 --> 00:43:36,487
完好如初
It hasn't ruined anything.

730
00:44:00,317 --> 00:44:01,716
脉搏82
NURSE: Pulse is 82.

731

情况稳定
He seems stable.

733
00:44:07,658 --> 00:44:10,388
好的，我们再检查一次血液，全面血检…
DOCTOR: Okay, let's do another blood work-up, CBCs...

734
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,291
- 小姐，你不能呆在这 - 我只是想…
Miss, you cannot be in here. I'd just like to

735
00:44:12,362 --> 00:44:13,761
- 问他一些问题 - 小姐，请吧
ask him a couple of questions. DOCTOR: Miss, please!

736
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:15,024
- 不，我很抱歉 - 拜托，听着
No, I'm sorry. Come on. Look.

737
00:44:15,098 --> 00:44:16,895
你不应该进来的
You know you're not supposed to be in here.

738
00:44:16,967 --> 00:44:18,127
我知道，我只是…
I know. I just...

739
00:44:21,738 --> 00:44:22,796
趴下！
(SCREAMING) Get on the ground!

740
00:44:26,576 --> 00:44:28,942
退后！趴着
OFFICER BROWN: Stand back! Stay down.

741
00:44:31,515 --> 00:44:32,504
(MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY)

742
00:44:46,496 --> 00:44:49,294
是我同事，我得走了
That's a colleague of mine. I'm gonna have to go.

743
00:44:49,366 --> 00:44:51,630
很抱歉，改天见
I'm really sorry. I'll see you soon.

744
00:44:51,702 --> 00:44:52,930
好的
Okay.

745
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,629
(SIRENS WAILING)

746
00:44:59,776 --> 00:45:02,404
让他进来，让他进来
OFFICER: Let him through. Blockade, let him through.

747
00:45:02,646 --> 00:45:03,670
嘿，瑞奇！
Hey, Ricky!

748

让他进来
Let him through.

00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,182
黛拉！
Della!

750
00:45:15,325 --> 00:45:17,350
你还好吗？ 你没事吧？
You okay? You all right?

751
00:45:21,231 --> 00:45:23,927
- 黛拉，告诉这不是你的，对吗？ - 什么东西？
Della, tell me that's not yours, right? What is it?

752
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,262
只是一点血
It's just a little bit of blood.

753
00:45:25,335 --> 00:45:27,064
没事，有我在，有我在，有我在
It's all right. I got it, I got it, I got it.

754
00:45:27,204 --> 00:45:28,967
没事了
It's okay.

755
00:45:30,507 --> 00:45:31,997
没事了
(WHIMPERING)

756
00:45:30,507 --> 00:45:31,997
It's okay.

It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.

759
00:45:39,116 --> 00:45:41,983
哦，我的天，卡尔 我们本来能救他的！
Oh, my God, Cal, we could have stopped this!

760
00:45:42,052 --> 00:45:43,417
怎么救，利用灵媒？
What, by being psychic?

761
00:45:43,487 --> 00:45:46,923
不，我们应该把那份文件交给警方的
No. We should have given the police that file.

762
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:50,426
说不定照片上有指纹呢？
What if there were fingerprints on the photographs?

763
00:45:51,328 --> 00:45:54,263
天啊，卡尔，我们不能坐视不管
God, Cal, we can't just let people get hurt like that.

764
00:45:54,331 --> 00:45:55,992
听着，都结束了，没事了，没事了
Look, it's over. It's all right. It's okay.

765
00:45:56,133 --> 00:45:57,794
我们不能见死不救
We can't just keep letting people get killed.

766
00:45:57,868 --> 00:45:59,768
不，有关系
No, it's not okay.

767
00:45:59,903 --> 00:46:01,837
没关系了，都过去了，都结束了
It's okay. It's over. It's over.

768
00:46:01,905 --> 00:46:03,395
已经结束了
It's over.

769
00:46:04,141 --> 00:46:06,473
明白吗？没事了
All right? It's okay.

770
00:46:13,917 --> 00:46:16,784
你们搁置了杀人案件的证据
CHRIS: You're sitting on evidence in an execution homicide.

771
00:46:16,853 --> 00:46:18,753
你们觉得昨晚受害者的家人…
How do you think that's gonna play with the family of the guy

772
00:46:18,822 --> 00:46:19,811
要是知道了会有什么反应？
that just got shot last night?

773
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:20,948
克里斯，事情已经过去了
Chris, let's be productive.

774
00:46:21,024 --> 00:46:22,048
等等，我还没有说完
Hold on, I'm actually not done.

775
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:24,650
我们的记者昨天晚上已经向警方提交了供述
Our reporter made a full statement last night.

776
00:46:24,728 --> 00:46:25,752
什么，什么时候的事情？
CHRIS: What, you had these when?

777
00:46:25,829 --> 00:46:26,887
卡姆，不要告诉他
Cam, don't answer that!

778
00:46:26,963 --> 00:46:28,954
什么时候发生的事？ 你想要被传审吗？
When did you have these? You want subpoenas?

779
00:46:29,032 --> 00:46:30,192
我现在就去打电话
I'll get on the phone right now.

780
00:46:30,267 --> 00:46:32,565
我们给你打电话了！ 在打给外部法律顾问之前！
We called you! We called you before we called outside counsel.

781
00:46:32,636 --> 00:46:34,570
有点晚，有一点晚
A little late. It's a little late.

782
00:46:34,638 --> 00:46:36,469
得了吧
Give me a break.

783
00:46:39,943 --> 00:46:41,808
最近好吗，唐？
How you doing, Don?

784
00:46:41,878 --> 00:46:43,209
我还说得过去，卡尔，你呢？
I'm hanging in, Cal. You?

785
00:46:43,346 --> 00:46:44,677
很好，我很好
Good. Good.

786
00:46:46,683 --> 00:46:49,516
还有其他线索需要我处理吗？
This source have anything else I might need to do my job?

787
00:46:49,586 --> 00:46:50,644
等一下
Wait a minute.

788
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,915
没有了，好吗？就这些了
Nothing, all right? This was it,

789
00:46:52,989 --> 00:46:55,150
我们知道了也不到一天
and we've kept it for less than a day.

790
00:46:56,159 --> 00:46:59,651
警探，我们也是直到昨天晚上才知道 事情的严重性的
Detective, until last night, we didn't actually know what we had here.

791
00:46:59,729 --> 00:47:01,094
胡说
Bullshit.

792
00:47:02,232 --> 00:47:04,666
你以为我是谁？傻子吗？
DONALD: Who do you think I am, Bambi's baby brother?

793
00:47:04,734 --> 00:47:05,894
不是的，先生
No, sir.

794
00:47:05,969 --> 00:47:07,834
你很清楚这份证据的分量
You knew exactly what you had.

795
00:47:07,904 --> 00:47:11,305
只是你觉得你比我们更需要这份证据
You just decided that your need was greater than ours,

796
00:47:11,374 --> 00:47:13,001
现在你手上沾满了血腥
and now you have blood on your hands.

797
00:47:13,076 --> 00:47:14,065
等等
CAL: Hold on.

798
00:47:14,211 --> 00:47:15,235
警探先生，听着
CAMERON: Detective, look.

799
00:47:16,179 --> 00:47:17,976
我们正在筹备的文章
The thesis that we are pursuing

800
00:47:18,048 --> 00:47:22,542
涉及了国会议员柯林斯先生正在调查的 一家公司
involves a certain company that Congressman Collins is investigating.

801
00:47:22,652 --> 00:47:24,620
这是集团阴谋？
DONALD: What, this is corporate conspiracies

802
00:47:24,754 --> 00:47:26,745
并且直接威胁最高领导层？
that threaten the highest levels?

803
00:47:26,823 --> 00:47:30,054
我做了这么多年的警探 只在电视上看到过这类事情
All my years on the job, I've only ever seen that on TV.

804
00:47:30,126 --> 00:47:33,459
我认识你那么多年，你只看体育比赛
All the years I've known you, you've only ever watched sports on TV.

805
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:37,626
警探先生，我们与您合作
CAMERON: So, Detective, in exchange for our cooperation,

806
00:47:37,701 --> 00:47:40,329
请问您能否也坦诚相待呢？
can we be assured that you will open your books to us?

807
00:47:40,403 --> 00:47:42,462
作为回报？
Quid pro quo?

808
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:48,874
如果我们决定将证据公诸于众 会提前6小时通知你们的
If we decide to go public with this, we'll give you six hours,

809
00:47:48,945 --> 00:47:50,105
但是仅此而已
but that's the end of it.

810
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:51,909
这起蓄意杀人案的调查是公开的
This is an open homicide investigation.

811
00:47:51,982 --> 00:47:53,677
你们拖我们后腿，将公众置于危险境地
You slow us down, endanger the public

812
00:47:53,817 --> 00:47:55,512
如果再有类似情况的话
any more than you already have,

813
00:47:55,585 --> 00:47:56,813
就不会这么简单了
it won't be pretty.

814
00:47:56,887 --> 00:47:58,286
正式申明一下，对于你们…
For the record, I'm still not happy

815
00:47:58,355 --> 00:47:59,720
上交证据的方式，我还是很不开心
the way you presented the evidence.

816
00:47:59,789 --> 00:48:02,485
我要把我的感觉说出来
I'm just gonna put that out there.

817
00:48:06,062 --> 00:48:07,586
别管和警方的闲扯
CAMERON: Police gossip being what it is,

818
00:48:07,664 --> 00:48:09,564
我猜想甚至“今夜娱乐”节目…
<i>I'm guessing that even Entertainment Tonight</i>

819
00:48:09,633 --> 00:48:12,431
在48小时内了解的情况不会比我们少
will know as much as we do within 48 hours.

820
00:48:12,502 --> 00:48:14,732
所以我们今天必须有确凿的报道
So we've gotta have something solid today.

821
00:48:14,804 --> 00:48:17,329
也就是说不要猜想，不要匿名信息
That means no assumptions, no unnamed sources.

822
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:20,205
我需要翔实的报道 我要这件事情水落石出
Not fast and loose. I want this thing wrung out.

823
00:48:21,077 --> 00:48:24,740
如果我们输给警察的话，那就太丢人了
Damned if we can't do a better job of it than those cops.

824
00:48:26,316 --> 00:48:28,147
黛拉，你还好吗？
Della, how are you?

825
00:48:28,952 --> 00:48:30,112
我很好
I'm good.

826
00:48:30,654 --> 00:48:31,848
- 真的？ - 嗯
Yeah? Mmm-hmm.

827
00:48:32,122 --> 00:48:33,248
好，好的
Good, okay.

828
00:48:33,323 --> 00:48:34,415
你负责索尼娅・贝克，好吗？
Well, you take Sonia Baker, okay?

829
00:48:34,491 --> 00:48:36,288
我要尽可能多的关于她的信息
I want to know everything that we can about her,

830
00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:39,123
她认识谁，和谁有性关系，内裤的颜色
who she knew, who she blew, the color of her knickers.

831
00:48:39,195 --> 00:48:41,026
- 明白了 - “尖兵集团”？
Got it. PointCorp?

832
00:48:41,731 --> 00:48:43,062
好，汉克和皮特 你们和卡尔一起负责
Okay. Hank and Pete, you work with Cal.

833
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:44,564
好
Cool.

834
00:48:44,634 --> 00:48:46,192
你们要谨慎
The rule on this one is discretion.

835
00:48:46,269 --> 00:48:50,569
在“独眼”喝酒时可不应该讨论这个问题
This is not a good subject for gossip over drinks at the Monocle,

836
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,132
还有你，在文件柜吸大麻的时候也不许
or spliffs in the stationery cupboard, you.

837
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:55,438
我觉得被冒犯了，真的
I'm offended, truly.

838
00:48:55,578 --> 00:48:56,806
生气吧
CAMERON: Well, be offended.

839
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,711
下楼，收拾东西，带到这来
Go downstairs, get your stuff, bring it in here,

840
00:48:58,782 --> 00:49:00,841
这就是你的新家了
because this is your new home.

841
00:49:00,917 --> 00:49:02,748
去啊！
Go on!

842
00:49:02,886 --> 00:49:04,717
好！ 行行行 光速
Okay! Yes, yes, yes. Speed of light.

843
00:49:12,195 --> 00:49:15,528
卡尔？对你来说有利益冲突吗？
Cal? Any conflict of interest here?

844
00:49:17,867 --> 00:49:19,027
没有
No.

845
00:49:21,338 --> 00:49:22,965
也许这是一个很好的机会…
<i>SLATOFF... Perhaps this is a good opportunity</i>

846
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:24,836
来处理另一个在这些听证会中…
<i>to address another issue that's been discussed</i>

847
00:49:24,908 --> 00:49:28,173
备受关注的问题，价格结构
<i>during these hearings, your price structure.</i>

848
00:49:28,244 --> 00:49:30,576
当然，谢谢您给我这次机会…
<i>Surely, and I thank you for giving me</i>

849
00:49:30,714 --> 00:49:33,080
来讨论这个问题
<i>an opportunity to touch on that today.</i>

850
00:49:33,717 --> 00:49:36,277
我公司的价格结构遵循国防部…
<i>Our price structure follows the Defense Department model</i>

851
00:49:36,353 --> 00:49:38,821
在第一次海湾战争期间建立的模式
<i>as established in the first Gulf War,</i>

852
00:49:38,955 --> 00:49:41,423
当然，由于通货膨胀做了相应调整
<i>adjusted, of course, for inflation.</i>

853
00:49:41,491 --> 00:49:44,927
令人欣慰的是，这次的大额支出是因为…
<i>Happily, what's costing us so much this time around</i>

854
00:49:44,995 --> 00:49:48,726
我们在战地医疗方面取得了长足的进步
<i>are some incredible advances in on-field medical care.</i>

855
00:49:49,165 --> 00:49:50,826
但是，简单来说，我们现在保持更多的…
<i>But, simply, we're now keeping more...</i>

856
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,061
先生，抱歉，只是…
<i>Sir, I'm sorry. Just...</i>

857
00:49:53,136 --> 00:49:55,366
在您当兵的时候，您打过仗吗？
<i>When you were in the military, did you see any combat duty?</i>

858
00:49:55,438 --> 00:49:56,962
没有，先生，我没有，没有
<i>No, sir, I did not. No.</i>

859
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,008
如果你打过仗，你觉得会改变你的看法吗？
<i>Do you think if you had, you might see things differently?</i>

860
00:49:59,075 --> 00:50:00,906
我们都知道您参加过战争，议员
<i>MAN... We're all aware of your war record, Congressman.</i>

861
00:50:00,977 --> 00:50:02,410
我说的不是我
<i>STEPHEN... I'm not talking about my record.</i>

862
00:50:02,479 --> 00:50:05,971
我指的是对“尖兵集团”以及分包商…
<i>I'm talking about the numerous allegations of atrocities</i>

863
00:50:06,049 --> 00:50:09,143
对伊拉克和阿富汗平民…
<i>committed by PointCorp and its subsidiary contractors</i>

864
00:50:09,219 --> 00:50:11,813
所犯下的累累罪行的控诉
<i>against the civilian population in Iraq and Afghanistan.</i>

865
00:50:11,888 --> 00:50:14,948
那些指控没有确凿证据
<i>MAN... Those are unsubstantiated allegations.</i>

866
00:50:15,025 --> 00:50:17,493
好的 那我直说了
<i>Okay. This is straightforward.</i>

867
00:50:17,694 --> 00:50:21,061
自从反恐战争开始后…
<i>Since a war on terror was declared,</i>

868
00:50:21,131 --> 00:50:25,329
您的身价是否上升了两亿五千万美元？
<i>has your personal net worth gone up by more than $250 million?</i>

869
00:50:30,974 --> 00:50:32,965
直接的问题
<i>Straightforward question.</i>

870
00:50:33,043 --> 00:50:36,069
抱歉，据说在公开会议中…
<i>Excuse me, I was told that personal financial data</i>

871
00:50:36,146 --> 00:50:39,081
个人经济状况是不予讨论的
<i>would not be addressed in open session.</i>

872
00:50:39,149 --> 00:50:40,480
适应情况
<i>Adapt.</i>

873
00:50:42,986 --> 00:50:44,681
那不正是你们的宣传语吗？
<i>Isn't that your slogan?</i>

874
00:50:44,821 --> 00:50:46,516
“适应情况，争取成功”
<i>"Adapt and Achieve?"</i>

875
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:50,058
这本宣传册上是这么写的
<i>It's on the brochure here.</i>

876
00:50:50,894 --> 00:50:53,863
“Commoda et Confice” 你们是用拉丁文写的
<i>"Commoda et Confice." You have it in Latin.</i>

877
00:50:54,364 --> 00:50:55,592
您的意思是？
<i>MAN... Your point being?</i>

878
00:50:55,665 --> 00:50:57,826
将战争交由惟利是图的人…
<i>Putting war in the hands of mercenaries</i>

879
00:50:57,967 --> 00:51:00,128
以及把战争看做是商机的人掌控
<i>and those who consider it a business</i>

880
00:51:00,203 --> 00:51:02,433
无论在任何语言中，都是矛盾的
<i>is a contradiction in terms in any language.</i>

881
00:51:02,505 --> 00:51:04,871
我能否提醒你，先生
<i>May I remind you, sir, that the wars</i>

882
00:51:05,008 --> 00:51:07,408
这个国家所参加的影响历史的战争
<i>this country fought, that defined it,</i>

883
00:51:07,477 --> 00:51:10,469
不是以金钱来计算的，更不是为了金钱而战
<i>were fought despite what they cost, not because of it.</i>

884
00:51:10,547 --> 00:51:13,311
我来这不是受道德教育的，议员先生
<i>I didn't come here for a lesson in morality, Congressman.</i>

885
00:51:13,383 --> 00:51:15,749
是的，我想也是的
<i>No, I expect you didn't.</i>

886
00:51:15,819 --> 00:51:17,946
尤其不是从你这受教育
<i>Well, especially from you.</i>

887
00:51:18,421 --> 00:51:19,911
为“尖兵集团”工作的人
<i>The men who work for PointCorp,</i>

888
00:51:19,989 --> 00:51:22,082
那些被你贬低成惟利是图的人
<i>the men you dishonor by calling them mercenaries</i>

889
00:51:22,158 --> 00:51:27,061
大部分都是退役美国军人
<i>are, by and large, retired American military personnel.</i>

890
00:51:29,165 --> 00:51:31,360
这体系很完善，对吗？
<i>It's a great system, isn't it?</i>

891
00:51:31,434 --> 00:51:35,370
我们出钱训练军人，然后你们送他们上战场 自己发财
<i>We pay to train these men, and you get rich by killing them.</i>

892
00:51:35,538 --> 00:51:36,527
(CROWD MURMURING)

893
00:51:45,248 --> 00:51:47,842
“尖兵集团”运转的很好
<i>PETE... PointCorp, well, they're on a roll.</i>

894
00:51:47,917 --> 00:51:50,715
他们刚买了60，000英亩的土地 扩建设备
<i>They just bought 60,000 acres to expand their facility.</i>

895
00:51:50,787 --> 00:51:52,049
- 60,000英亩 - 没错
60,000 acres. Yeah.

896
00:51:52,122 --> 00:51:53,111
在哪？
Where?

897
00:51:53,189 --> 00:51:55,453
北卡罗来纳州的康维
In Conway, North Carolina.

898
00:51:55,558 --> 00:51:58,425
当地人称之为小巴格达
The locals call it Little Baghdad.

899
00:51:58,495 --> 00:52:00,395
但是并不小
Not so little.

900
00:52:00,463 --> 00:52:04,058
他们在当地还有些房地产生意
<i>HANK... They've also got some interesting real estate locally.</i>

901
00:52:04,134 --> 00:52:06,728
在水门大厦有办公室
<i>Offices at the Watergate building.</i>

902
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:08,560
看看
Check that out.

903
00:52:08,638 --> 00:52:11,334
“自由倡议勋章” 是什么？
"Medal of Freedom Initiative." What's that?

904
00:52:11,508 --> 00:52:13,339
议员游说者行业
<i>PETE... It's a lobbying interest.</i>

905
00:52:13,409 --> 00:52:14,808
是的，根据网站内容
<i>HANK... Yeah, according to the website,</i>

906
00:52:14,944 --> 00:52:16,343
MOFI，自由倡议勋章
<i>MOFI, Medal of Freedom Initiative,</i>

907
00:52:16,412 --> 00:52:18,471
是一部分私营防卫承包商…
<i>is an umbrella group for a bunch</i>

908
00:52:18,615 --> 00:52:20,674
的保护伞组织
<i>of these private defense contractors.</i>

909
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:23,913
他们游说些议员，开些舞会 抹杀些事情
<i>You know, they lobby a little, party a little, kill things.</i>

910
00:52:23,987 --> 00:52:25,181
MOFI！
<i>PETE... MOFI!</i>

911
00:52:26,389 --> 00:52:27,720
有人吗？
<i>(WHOOPING)</i>

912
00:52:26,389 --> 00:52:27,720
Hello?

913
00:52:28,024 --> 00:52:30,618
我们去过那里了，一个人都没有
<i>PETE... We went down there. The place is totally empty...</i>

914
00:52:30,727 --> 00:52:32,991
就好像他们在等待征新兵一样
<i>Like they're just waiting for all their new recruits.</i>

915
00:52:33,062 --> 00:52:35,360
他们外派到到孟买还是怎么了？
Did they outsource to Mumbai or something?

916
00:52:35,431 --> 00:52:38,628
还是在等待壮大队伍？
Or are they just getting ready for an expansion?

917
00:52:39,636 --> 00:52:40,694
有人吗？
CAL: Hello?

918
00:52:42,338 --> 00:52:45,239
我是黛拉・弗雷娅，我是环球报的记者
<i>This is Della Frye. I'm a reporter over at the Globe.</i>

919
00:52:45,308 --> 00:52:47,276
你曾经是索尼娅・贝克的律师
You were Sonia Baker's attorney

920
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:49,401
负责她入店行窃的案件，对吗？
on her shoplifting case, correct?

921
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:53,046
是不是多米尼克把我的号码给你的？
<i>MAN... Did Dominic give you my number?</i>

922
00:52:54,717 --> 00:52:57,777
没错，你是怎么认识多米尼克的？
Yes, how do you know Dominic?

923
00:52:57,854 --> 00:53:00,482
我很抱歉，这样做不太合适
<i>Well, I'm sorry. This really isn't appropriate.</i>

924
00:53:00,557 --> 00:53:01,854
我…
<i>(LINE DISCONNECTS) I...</i>

925
00:53:01,925 --> 00:53:05,053
嘿，麦克，我想找个人…
Hey, Michael, I need someone to help me dig

926
00:53:05,128 --> 00:53:07,289
深入了解“尖兵集团”
a little deeper into PointCorp.

927
00:53:07,597 --> 00:53:09,428
我需要一个公司内部人员
I need somebody on the inside,

928
00:53:09,566 --> 00:53:11,431
并且要知道他们是如何运转的
somebody who knows the way they operate.

929
00:53:14,737 --> 00:53:17,535
她到处欠债
<i>WOMAN... She owed everybody money.</i>

930
00:53:17,607 --> 00:53:19,973
哦，天啊，所以她才穿着内衣…
Oh, God, that's how she always walked around,

931
00:53:20,043 --> 00:53:21,908
到处跑
in her underwear.

932
00:53:22,812 --> 00:53:24,370
太好了！ 你动了，你不能动的
Yeah! You moved. You can't move.

933
00:53:24,447 --> 00:53:25,471
嗨！你好！是的，是的
Hi! Hi, yes, yes.

934

这是谁？ 看着有点眼熟

935
00:53:28,184 --> 00:53:30,709
多米尼克・弗伊 索尼娅的朋友

936
00:53:30,787 --> 00:53:32,118

937
00:53:32,322 --> 00:53:34,790
嘿，麦克，是卡尔 你发现了什么？
Hey, Michael, it's Cal. So what did you find out?

<i>(KNOCKING AT DOOR)</i>

939
00:53:38,094 --> 00:53:40,289
你好，斯塔勒先生？ 什么事？
<i>DELLA... Hi. Mr. Statler? STATLER... Yes?</i>

940
00:53:40,363 --> 00:53:41,591
我是环球报的记者
<i>Yes, I'm from the Globe.</i>

941
00:53:41,664 --> 00:53:43,894
我在写一篇关于索尼娅・贝克之死的文章
I'm writing an article on the death of Sonia Baker,

942
00:53:43,967 --> 00:53:45,491
我想…
and I just wanted to...

943
00:53:46,069 --> 00:53:47,764
他曾在“尖兵集团”当高层？
And he was, like, high up in PointCorp?

944
00:53:48,571 --> 00:53:51,335
你好，我是华盛顿环球报的黛拉・弗雷娅
<i>Hi. Della Frye from the Washington Globe.</i>

945
00:53:51,808 --> 00:53:53,935
我…我能不能和你谈谈？ 请别…
I... Could I speak to you? Please don't...

946
00:53:54,043 --> 00:53:57,012
是的，我还没挂 因为我就是干这个的，我喜欢这么做
Yes, I'm still holding 'cause that's what I do. That's what I like to do.

947
00:53:59,048 --> 00:54:01,516
索尼娅・贝克以前的舍友 朗达・希瓦
Sonia Baker's ex-roommate, Rhonda Silver.

948
00:54:01,584 --> 00:54:03,017
没有人知道她在哪
Nobody's got her yet.

949
00:54:03,086 --> 00:54:06,249
在过去的几年里她换了很多名字
She changed her name a couple times in the past year.

950
00:54:06,322 --> 00:54:07,812
你怎么知道的？
How'd you get it?

951
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:10,120
我答应了和一个很会出汗的叫维克的人约会
I had to agree to go on not one,

952
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:12,524
不是一次，而是两次约会
but two dates with a sweaty guy named Vic.

953
00:54:14,764 --> 00:54:17,096
千万别问
Don't even ask me.

954
00:54:17,333 --> 00:54:18,561
嘿，鲍勃，是卡尔
Hey, Bob, it's Cal.

955
00:54:18,635 --> 00:54:20,626
能不能帮我查一个社保号码？
Want to run a Social Security number for me?

956
00:54:20,627 --> 00:54:21,832
“‘尖兵集团’经理深陷政府直派合同”

957
00:54:22,038 --> 00:54:24,053
“‘尖兵集团’拒绝公布伤亡数字”

958
00:54:28,244 --> 00:54:30,144
朗达・希瓦的号码
(EXCLAIMS)

959
00:54:28,244 --> 00:54:30,144
Rhonda Silver's number.

960
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,214
我们刚才那么做犯法吗？
Did we just break the law?

961
00:54:32,282 --> 00:54:34,341
没，我们称之为精确报道
Nope, that's what you call damn fine reporting.

962
00:54:34,417 --> 00:54:36,214
- 你的笔 - 留着吧
Your pen. Keep it.

963
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:39,315
- 不用谢！ - 谢谢！
You're welcome! Thank you!

964
00:54:42,025 --> 00:54:44,289
嗨，请问朗达在吗？
Hi. Is Rhonda there, please?

965
00:54:44,994 --> 00:54:47,292
我是朗达的旧校友
I'm actually an old friend of Rhonda's from school.

966
00:54:47,363 --> 00:54:51,299
我今天正好在这，我想去看看她
I'm in town for the day, and I thought maybe I'd stop by and see her.

967
00:54:51,367 --> 00:54:53,392
我可以去她工作单位吗？
Do you think I could show up at her work?

968
00:54:53,536 --> 00:54:55,561
那样可以吗？
Would that be all right?

969
00:55:09,285 --> 00:55:12,277
先生，我一会再打给你，行吗？
Actually, sir, can I call you back?

970
00:55:13,856 --> 00:55:15,346
那一页和下页
That page and the next page.

971
00:55:16,092 --> 00:55:18,754
这个叫杰瑞・塞姆斯的是当地的政客
HANK: This guy, Jerry Symes, local politician,

972
00:55:18,828 --> 00:55:20,523
他参加了反扩张运动…
he campaigns against the expansion,

973
00:55:20,663 --> 00:55:22,358
接着就在一起离奇的车祸中丧生
and then he dies in a freak car accident.

974
00:55:22,432 --> 00:55:24,662
好的，“离奇的车祸”是什么意思？
CAL: All right, what does "freak car accident" mean?

975
00:55:24,734 --> 00:55:26,531
大白天…他在空旷的马路上开车
Middle of the day... He's driving on the open road...

976
00:55:26,602 --> 00:55:27,660
- 没有目击证人 - …30英里时速…
No witnesses. ...30 miles an hour...

977
00:55:27,737 --> 00:55:29,170
- 天气很好，没有打滑的痕迹 - …汽车翻了身
Perfect weather, no skid marks. ...car turns over.

978
00:55:29,238 --> 00:55:32,071
警方认为有可能是睡眠中呼吸中断
And the police think it might be sleep apnea.

979
00:55:32,141 --> 00:55:35,133
卡尔，抱歉，我有重要的事情要和你说
Cal. Sorry, I really need to talk to you.

980
00:55:37,513 --> 00:55:38,878
发现什么了？
What do you got?

981
00:55:39,015 --> 00:55:40,380
我刚在看那段有索尼娅…
So, I was looking for images of Sonia

982
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:42,941
的地铁监视录像
in the Metro security footage, right?

983
00:55:43,019 --> 00:55:47,854
她进入盲点20分钟后，这个人出现了
And 20 seconds after she went into the blind spot, this guy appears.

984
00:55:48,524 --> 00:55:49,752
知道吗？
Okay?

985
00:55:52,595 --> 00:55:55,928
我昨晚在医院看到他了
I think that I saw him last night at the hospital.

986
00:56:02,305 --> 00:56:03,932
你确定吗？
Are you sure?

987
00:56:17,987 --> 00:56:19,579
麦克，我是卡尔
Michael, it's Cal.

988
00:56:19,655 --> 00:56:23,386
你说的“尖兵集团”的内部人员 我现在要见他
Your PointCorp insider, I need to meet him, now.

989
00:56:53,856 --> 00:56:55,448
你要知道
I want you to know something.

990
00:56:55,591 --> 00:56:57,218
我爱祖国
I love my country.

991
00:56:57,293 --> 00:56:58,419
我爱军队
I love the military.

992
00:56:58,561 --> 00:56:59,687
我的目标是挽救他们
My aim here is to save them.

993
00:56:59,762 --> 00:57:00,922
你明白我的规矩吗？
You understand my terms?

994
00:57:00,997 --> 00:57:02,089
我不会告诉你名字
I will not give you my name.

995
00:57:02,165 --> 00:57:04,656
也不会告诉你我在“尖兵集团”的职位
I will not give you my rank in the PointCorp military structure,

996
00:57:04,734 --> 00:57:06,429
以及我服役的起讫日期
or the in and out dates of my service.

997
00:57:06,502 --> 00:57:07,992
明白了
Understand.

998
00:57:09,439 --> 00:57:11,100
我在找一个人
CAL: I'm looking for a guy that PointCorp

999
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,901
他参加了“尖兵集团”的隐蔽军事行动
are using on a covert operation.

1000
00:57:12,975 --> 00:57:14,340
官方完全否认
Total deniability.

1001
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:16,571
我们在国防部共同的朋友觉得…
Our mutual friend at DOD thought

1002
00:57:16,712 --> 00:57:18,907
你有可能能帮助我们找到他
you might be able to help us find him.

1003
00:57:20,249 --> 00:57:22,911
我不知道，我会查一下
I don't know. I'll check it out.

1004
00:57:25,688 --> 00:57:28,851
你是怎么理解“尖兵集团”的口号的？
So, what's your understanding of the PointCorp MO?

1005
00:57:28,925 --> 00:57:30,324
他们的口号？
Their MO?

1006
00:57:30,393 --> 00:57:32,122
他们随心所欲
They do whatever the hell they want.

1007
00:57:32,595 --> 00:57:34,620
这些军人不受束缚
These soldiers are answerable to no one.

1008
00:57:34,764 --> 00:57:36,823
只对支票效忠
They're loyal to nothing but a paycheck.

1009
00:57:36,899 --> 00:57:39,629
是对穆斯林恐怖主义的淘金热
It's the Muslim terror gold rush.

1010
00:57:39,702 --> 00:57:41,829
- 那些听证会你注意没？ - 是的
You've been watching these hearings? Yeah.

1011
00:57:41,904 --> 00:57:44,338
委员会的主席，史蒂芬・柯林斯…
So, the head of the committee there, Stephen Collins...

1012
00:57:44,407 --> 00:57:45,567
他完蛋了
He's finished.

1013
00:57:45,641 --> 00:57:47,973
他们会不断攻击他直到他离职
They'll just keep knocking him down until he goes away.

1014
00:57:48,044 --> 00:57:49,909
你知道他的所做所为造成了多大的威胁吗？
Do you have any idea what he's threatening here?

1015
00:57:49,979 --> 00:57:53,073
公司每年赚三、四百亿
This is $30 or $40 billion annually.

1016
00:57:53,149 --> 00:57:54,776
上帝都会愤怒的数字
That's wrath of God money.

1017
00:57:54,851 --> 00:57:57,149
听证会上说的是三、四十亿
The hearings are saying 3 or 4.

1018
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:59,711
那是海外的，真正让尖兵集团赚大钱的…
Overseas. The real money is what PointCorp

1019
00:57:59,856 --> 00:58:02,381
是国内的军事行动
stands to make in its domestic operations.

1020
00:58:02,825 --> 00:58:04,725
我以为他们不在国内行动
I wasn't aware that they had any.

1021
00:58:04,794 --> 00:58:08,958
卡特里娜飓风过后是谁被派去控制局面？ 是我们
Who was sent in for crowd control after Hurricane Katrina? Us.

1022
00:58:09,465 --> 00:58:11,262
私营安保承包商被授权…
Private security contractors deputized

1023
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,231
射击美国民众
to shoot at American citizens.

1024
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:17,369
芝加哥警察的新审问技巧是谁训练出来的？
<i>Who's training Chicago police on new interrogation techniques?</i>

1025
00:58:18,007 --> 00:58:20,703
很快，“尖兵集团”就会取代国家安全委员会
Soon, PointCorp will take over from the NSA

1026
00:58:20,843 --> 00:58:23,573
监听电话，有关恐怖分子资料，所有的一切
on phone taps, terrorist databases, all of it.

1027
00:58:24,347 --> 00:58:26,247
这是国内情报策略的…
It's a fundamental restructuring

1028
00:58:26,315 --> 00:58:28,374
根本重组
of domestic intelligence policy.

1029
00:58:29,151 --> 00:58:32,018
是国土安全的民营私有化
It is the privatization of Homeland Security.

1030
00:58:32,088 --> 00:58:34,522
数以亿计的美元
Billions and billions of dollars.

1031
00:58:34,857 --> 00:58:37,325
你真的认为他们会为了一个…
Now you really think they're gonna forfeit all that

1032
00:58:37,393 --> 00:58:39,327
从宾夕法尼亚州第七选区来的英雄…
<i>because some hero from the seventh district</i>

1033
00:58:39,462 --> 00:58:41,396
放弃所有这一切吗？
<i>of Pennsylvania thinks that they should?</i>

1034
00:58:41,464 --> 00:58:42,453
嘿
Hey.

1035
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:47,126
我刚联系到了一个曾经在 “尖兵集团”工作的员工
<i>CAL... I just got told by a former PointCorp employee</i>

1036
00:58:47,203 --> 00:58:49,831
他告诉我他们打算垄断国家安全工作
<i>that they have a plan to monopolize domestic security</i>

1037
00:58:49,906 --> 00:58:51,601
每年可赚四百亿
<i>that's worth about $40 billion a year.</i>

1038
00:58:51,741 --> 00:58:53,436
是真的吗？
<i>Is that true?</i>

1039
00:58:53,509 --> 00:58:55,306
- 没错 - 怎么做的？
<i>STEPHEN... Yes. CAL... How?</i>

1040
00:58:55,378 --> 00:58:57,903
你不能把所有我告诉你的事情与我关联起来
You cannot connect anything that I tell you back to me.

1041
00:58:57,980 --> 00:58:59,174
- 你知道吗？ - 当然
You understand? Of course.

1042
00:58:59,248 --> 00:59:00,237
好吧
Okay.

1043
00:59:01,384 --> 00:59:04,581
去年有47家公司竞标国土安全合约
Last year, 47 companies bid on major Homeland Security contracts.

1044
00:59:04,654 --> 00:59:07,316
其中有16家公司夺标
Of those, 16 companies were granted the bids.

1045
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:11,451
在夺标的公司中，14家公司有联系
Of those, I could make connections between 14 companies,

1046
00:59:11,527 --> 00:59:13,495
我说的不是…
and I'm not just talking about someone leaving one company

1047
00:59:13,563 --> 00:59:14,587
公司间的人员流动
and go work for another.

1048
00:59:14,664 --> 00:59:16,495
我说的是共同的银行帐户
I'm talking about shared banking practices.

1049
00:59:16,632 --> 00:59:18,463
说的是一致的阴谋
I'm talking about collusive behavior.

1050
00:59:18,534 --> 00:59:20,866
我的观点就是 到最后…
Now, my belief is, when all's said and done

1051
00:59:21,003 --> 00:59:23,335
把面纱揭开…
and when the veil is pulled away,

1052
00:59:23,406 --> 00:59:26,534
你看到的不是14家不同的公司
you will not see 14 individual companies.

1053
00:59:27,176 --> 00:59:31,010
而是一家公司，明白吗?
You will see one company. You understand?

1054
00:59:32,381 --> 00:59:33,575
你一直在四处打探
And you've been digging around

1055
00:59:33,716 --> 00:59:34,910
试图弄清他们之间的关系
trying to make those connections clear.

1056
00:59:34,984 --> 00:59:36,815
是的，没错
Yeah. That's right.

1057
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:40,045
索尼娅也参与其中？
And Sonia was working on that?

1058
00:59:40,122 --> 00:59:41,987
她是首席研究员
She was my lead researcher.

1059
00:59:42,124 --> 00:59:44,024
她参与了所有事情
She was involved in everything we did.

1060
00:59:44,093 --> 00:59:46,687
他们无论如何不会放过你的，史蒂芬
They're gonna get you, Stephen, one way or another.

1061
00:59:46,762 --> 00:59:50,323
他们有四百亿个好理由除掉你
They got 40 billion good reasons to want you out of the way.

1062
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:51,764
你必须发表正式申明
You gotta go on the record.

1063
00:59:51,901 --> 00:59:53,266
将焦点转向他们
Swing the spotlight back on them.

1064
00:59:53,336 --> 00:59:55,827
你得保护自己，兄弟
You gotta protect yourself, man.

1065
00:59:57,106 --> 01:00:00,769
你要帮我找能把索尼娅的死和“尖兵集团”…
You go out there and find me evidence

1066
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:04,174
联系起来的证据
linking Sonia's death to PointCorp.

1067
01:00:05,948 --> 01:00:08,280
我会发表正式申明
I will go on the record.

1068
01:00:08,417 --> 01:00:10,749
我会将这件事公诸于众
I will shout this thing from the rooftops.

1069
01:00:11,754 --> 01:00:13,312
我没问题
I can do that.

1070
01:00:17,293 --> 01:00:20,956
好了，我要进去了，保持联系
All right. I gotta get back. I'll be in touch.

1071
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:22,964
- 史蒂芬 - 什么事？
Stephen. Yeah?

1072
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:25,362
一切小心
Just watch your back.

1073
01:00:25,501 --> 01:00:27,264
你也是
You, too.

1074
01:00:36,512 --> 01:00:38,275
嗨，朗达在这吗？
Hi. Is Rhonda here?

1075
01:00:38,414 --> 01:00:40,177
在，她就在那边
Yeah, she's just right over there.

1076
01:00:40,983 --> 01:00:41,972
哦
<i>(SINGING) Whoa</i>

1077
01:00:42,118 --> 01:00:44,313
我踏着阳光前行
<i>I'm walking on sunshine</i>

1078
01:00:44,654 --> 01:00:46,349
哦
<i>Whoa</i>

1079
01:00:46,489 --> 01:00:49,049
我踏着阳光前行
<i>I'm walking on sunshine</i>

1080
01:00:49,125 --> 01:00:50,717
哦
<i>Whoa</i>

1081
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,825
感觉如此美妙
<i>And don't it feel good</i>

1082
01:00:53,029 --> 01:00:54,018
耶！
Yeah!

1083
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:57,597
卡尔 你不会相信索尼娅的前舍友跟我说了什么的
DELLA: Cal, you're not gonna believe what Sonia's old roommate just told me.

1084
01:00:58,567 --> 01:01:00,865
你说对了 我一个字也不相信
You're right. I don't believe a word of it.

1085
01:01:00,936 --> 01:01:03,097
你没有确证的事实，没有目击证人
You got no corroboration, no independent witness,

1086
01:01:03,172 --> 01:01:05,265
而且很显然她缺钱，她的动机很明显
and she obviously has a financial motivation.

1087
01:01:05,341 --> 01:01:07,332
索尼娅・贝克的舍友声明…
We've got Sonia Baker's roommate claiming

1088
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:09,378
她和史蒂芬・柯林斯玩三角关系
she had a threesome with Stephen Collins,

1089
01:01:09,445 --> 01:01:10,537
你要忽视这一点吗？
and you want to ignore that?

1090
01:01:10,613 --> 01:01:13,241
我不是要忽视，我只说要考虑
I am not saying ignore it. I am saying consider it.

1091
01:01:13,315 --> 01:01:15,249
考虑这会对我们所掌握的其他信息 产生什么样的影响
Consider how it impacts everything else we have,

1092
01:01:15,317 --> 01:01:17,251
考虑她有可能满嘴胡话
and consider that she is full of shit!

1093
01:01:17,319 --> 01:01:19,617
没错，但是， 卡尔 她还说
Yeah, but, Cal, she's also saying

1094
01:01:19,689 --> 01:01:23,056
史蒂芬帮索尼娅还了四万美元的卡账
that Stephen paid off Sonia's $40,000 credit card debt.

1095
01:01:23,125 --> 01:01:24,456
那足以写篇文章
That is a story.

1096
01:01:24,527 --> 01:01:26,358
这消息必须要上头版
Somebody's gonna put that on the front page.

1097
01:01:26,429 --> 01:01:29,159
好吧，这样做对吗？
Okay, is that the right thing to do?

1098
01:01:29,231 --> 01:01:32,598
听着，那部分是你负责的，是你的独家新闻
Look, it's your half of the story. It's your scoop.

1099
01:01:32,668 --> 01:01:35,296
由你自己决定，随你怎么做
Your decision. Do whatever you want.

1100
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:47,847
但是我知道我和史蒂芬…
<i>ANNE... But I do know that Stephen and I</i>

1101
01:01:47,983 --> 01:01:50,850
一起经历了很多…
<i>have been through far too much together</i>

1102
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:54,617
才走到今天，这一刻将决定成败
<i>to make this one moment the thing that defines us forever.</i>

1103
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:55,987
政治前途…
<i>REPORTER... The political future...</i>

1104
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:12,935
我试过给你打电话
I tried to call.

1105
01:02:13,442 --> 01:02:17,742
我打了12次，但是每次都挂掉了
I mean, I actually did call about 12 times, but I hung up every time.

1106
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:21,281
你来我很高兴
Well, you know, I'm glad you dropped by,

1107
01:02:22,118 --> 01:02:24,882
因为我一直想和你谈谈
'cause I've been wanting to talk to you.

1108
01:02:28,491 --> 01:02:31,051
记得你从柏林洪堡带来的那个女孩吗？
Remember you brought that girl from Humboldt?

1109
01:02:31,127 --> 01:02:32,526
索蕾尔，还是叫什么的
Soleil, or whatever her name was.

1110
01:02:32,595 --> 01:02:33,687
露娜
Luna.

1111
01:02:33,763 --> 01:02:36,391
露娜，没错
Luna. That's right.

1112
01:02:36,954 --> 01:02:40,219
当时整个过程你们俩都被吓僵了
And you two were stoned the whole time.

1113
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:41,314
对
Yep.

1114
01:02:41,391 --> 01:02:43,291
你成功把船弄翻了，弄丢所有的东西
You managed to flip the boat, and we lost everything.

1115
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:44,418
剩下的路程都是靠走的…
We had to walk the rest of the way...

1116
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:45,586
我们把船弄翻了？
We flipped the boat?

1117
01:02:45,662 --> 01:02:46,720
你弄翻了
You did.

1118
01:02:47,431 --> 01:02:49,058
那的确是次冒险
It was an adventure.

1119
01:02:49,666 --> 01:02:51,293
你一直都在冒险
That's what you kept saying.

1120
01:02:51,835 --> 01:02:52,893
爱尔兰酒
Irish wine.

1121
01:02:53,036 --> 01:02:54,128
威士忌？
Whiskey?

1122
01:02:55,539 --> 01:02:57,268
- 干杯 - 干杯（爱尔兰语）
<i>Cheers. Sláinte.</i>

1123
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,604
- 那… - 那…
So... So...

1124
01:03:06,483 --> 01:03:07,950
- 我一直… - 我想问问…
I've been... I wanted to ask...

1125
01:03:08,018 --> 01:03:09,849
- 抱歉 - 你先说吧
Sorry. You first.

1126
01:03:11,922 --> 01:03:13,617
我在想…
I was wondering,

1127
01:03:16,393 --> 01:03:21,160
你觉得史蒂芬能瞒着你凑到4万美金吗？
do you think Stephen could have pulled together $40,000 without you knowing?

1128
01:03:21,231 --> 01:03:22,357
什么？
What?

1129
01:03:22,432 --> 01:03:23,626
这消息可能令人震惊
Well, it's a story that might break

1130
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:26,191
它会直指史蒂芬正在做一些…
that basically accuses Stephen of doing something

1131
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:30,639
须要直接调用大量现金的行为
that would require his having access to a large amount of cash.

1132
01:03:30,707 --> 01:03:33,540
我在想，他会这么做吗？
I was just wondering, could he do that?

1133
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:34,838
震惊的消息？
A story that might break?

1134
01:03:34,912 --> 01:03:36,777
你是说和你有关的事情？
You mean something that you're involved in?

1135
01:03:36,847 --> 01:03:38,678
- 间接有关 - 你在做什么？
Indirectly. What are you doing?

1136
01:03:38,749 --> 01:03:41,479
我在努力帮助史蒂芬 努力保护你
I'm trying to help Stephen. I'm trying to protect you.

1137
01:03:42,019 --> 01:03:43,577
胡扯！
Bullshit!

You always do this.

1140
01:03:49,526 --> 01:03:52,723
有时候我觉得我们大家都约好了似的
Sometimes I feel like we all made this deal,

1141
01:03:52,796 --> 01:03:56,857
然后发现事情对你和史蒂芬都有好处 但对我不是
and it works out great for you and Stephen, and not for me.

1142
01:03:56,934 --> 01:03:58,333
然后等我们其他人发现之后…
And instead of us just figuring it out,

1143
01:03:58,402 --> 01:04:02,600
你们俩就像什么也没发生一样信步离开
you guys are just fine walking around as if nothing ever happened.

1144
01:04:08,211 --> 01:04:09,473
好吧
Okay.

1145
01:04:13,216 --> 01:04:15,047
好吧，我们再来一次
Okay, let's start over.

1146
01:04:15,118 --> 01:04:16,517
我来这是为了和你谈谈…
I come here to tell you that I'm thinking

1147
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:17,917
我想结束这段婚姻的事情
about walking away from my marriage,

1148
01:04:17,988 --> 01:04:19,751
而你说的什么？
and you say what?

1149
01:04:20,624 --> 01:04:24,060
我说太晚了 时过境迁了
I say it's too late. We're way past this.

1150
01:04:25,128 --> 01:04:26,857
你作出了你的选择
You made your choice.

1151
01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:28,363
那是因为你不肯行动
Because you wouldn't step up.

1152
01:04:28,432 --> 01:04:30,229
你到底在想什么？
(STAMMERING) What do you mean?

1153
01:04:31,468 --> 01:04:34,198
那时不肯，现在不肯，大学时不肯
Not then, not now, not in college.

1154
01:04:35,772 --> 01:04:37,706
我是说，你现在在要求我…
I'm saying that you're asking me

1155
01:04:37,841 --> 01:04:39,775
给你一些不现实的东西
for something that's not real.

1156
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:42,501
这就是我的意思
That's what I'm saying.

1157

安妮…
(SIGHS) Annie...

1158
01:04:58,495 --> 01:05:01,020
我们正在按揭两处房产
We have two mortgages.

1159
01:05:01,098 --> 01:05:03,259
在维吉尼亚有
We have the place in Virginia.

1160
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,595
这边的公寓也是
We've got the apartment here.

1161
01:05:05,669 --> 01:05:07,034
可以说，我们用上了我们的一切
Basically, we spend everything we make,

1162
01:05:07,104 --> 01:05:10,938
所以，史蒂芬不可能在我不知情的情况下…
so there's no way Stephen could have given anyone $40,000

1163
01:05:11,008 --> 01:05:13,306
给任何人4万美金
without me knowing about it.

1164
01:05:15,612 --> 01:05:17,512
- 安妮… - 没关系
Annie... It's okay.

1165
01:05:20,384 --> 01:05:22,375
我现在是个线人
Now I'm just a source,

1166
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:25,713
所以别有压力
so the pressure's off.

Except we didn't, did we?

01:15:24,621 --> 01:15:27,681
没有，没有 因为某个混蛋认为这不值得报道
No, no, no, 'cause some wanker decided it was beneath us.

而他们只关心销量，而不是是非

1274
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:01,045
而且我…我怎么和他们解释说 我们现在在一则新闻上落后了
And how am... How am I gonna tell them that we are now behind a story

1275
01:16:01,124 --> 01:16:03,251
而我们曾经有第一手资料？
we were once in front of?

1276
01:16:04,994 --> 01:16:08,191
好了，我们要把迄今为止得到的东西登报 就今天

And we haven't got the rest of the story.

1282

I'm sure we can all find a way to get along.

1300
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:22,562

1301
01:17:22,705 --> 01:17:24,332
我们不可能在期限前完成的
There is no way we can meet that deadline.

1302

不，我们能 好了，同志们，我们现在火烧眉毛了
Yes, we can. All right, guys, we're getting our balls busted.

The lobbying subsidiary of PointCorp.

1324

1325
01:18:18,661 --> 01:18:20,151
你要我通知罗尼带装备来吗？

我们是谁？警察吗？
What are we, cops now?

1331
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:31,506
这就是在犯法啊
That's totally illegal.

1332
01:18:31,574 --> 01:18:35,305
如果多米尼克・弗伊能把索尼娅・贝克 和“尖兵集团”关联起来
If Dominic Foy can connect Sonia Baker to PointCorp,

1333
01:18:35,378 --> 01:18:36,640
那他一定有很大的压力…
he's gonna be under a lot of pressure

1334
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:38,703
以致于他会告诉我们实情，不是吗？
to recant anything he might tell us, all right?

1335
01:18:38,781 --> 01:18:40,646
所以我们要给他录音，这样才保险
So we put him on tape. That's our insurance.

1336
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:42,877
你怎么知道他会告诉你？
And why do you think he's even gonna talk to you?

1337
01:18:42,952 --> 01:18:44,749
因为他害怕
Because he's scared.

1338
01:18:44,821 --> 01:18:46,379
你怎么知道？
How do you know?

1339
01:18:46,522 --> 01:18:48,114
因为我要让他害怕
Because I'm gonna scare him.

1340
01:19:21,324 --> 01:19:24,157
嘿，外面的是你的卡迪拉克吗？
Hey, is that your Cadillac out there?

1341
01:19:26,128 --> 01:19:27,527
对
Yeah.

1342
01:19:27,597 --> 01:19:31,863
V-8发动机，320马力 自适应巡航控制，平视显示器设计
V-8 XLR, 320 horsepower, adaptive cruise control, heads-up display?

1343
01:19:31,934 --> 01:19:34,334
- 没错 - 那真是辆好车
That's the one. That's a hell of an impressive car.

1344
01:19:34,403 --> 01:19:35,893
对，没错
Yes, I know.

1345
01:19:37,273 --> 01:19:40,834
你的游乐场里是什么宝贝？
What do you got in your gay-rage?

1346
01:19:41,677 --> 01:19:44,737
- 什么？ - 你的游乐场，车库
Excuse me? Your gay-rage. Your garage.

1347
01:19:44,881 --> 01:19:46,371
- 对 - 你也有同样的车吗？
Right. You drive the same thing?

1348
01:19:46,449 --> 01:19:50,579
- 不，没有，我有辆90年产的萨博 - 噢
No, I don't. I have a 1990 Saab. Oh.

1349
01:19:50,653 --> 01:19:54,521
对，我有丝绒座套 不过乘客席那边的烂了
Yeah. I got velour seats. The passenger side one's ripped,

1350
01:19:54,590 --> 01:19:56,751
但他还是能兜着我到处走
but it gets me from A to B, you know.

1351
01:19:56,826 --> 01:19:58,350
我很遗憾
Sorry to hear that.

1352
01:19:58,427 --> 01:20:01,328
如果我能在公共关系公司工作就好了 不是吗？
If only I could get a job in PR, right?

1353
01:20:05,034 --> 01:20:06,626
你到底是谁？
Who the hell are you?

1354
01:20:06,702 --> 01:20:08,636
你有读报纸吗，多米尼克？
Do you read the newspapers, Dominic?

1355
01:20:09,071 --> 01:20:10,504
- 有时候 - 好
Sometimes. Okay.

1356
01:20:10,573 --> 01:20:12,564
我有些东西要提醒你，明白吗？
I got something I want to run by you, all right?

1357
01:20:12,642 --> 01:20:14,974
这事没完，我还在调查这事
It ain't finished. I'm still working it up.

1358
01:20:15,111 --> 01:20:17,477
看看你对这些有何感想：
Let's see how you feel about this.

1359
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:20,708
“多米尼克・弗伊，一位与国防承包商…
"Dominic Foy, a D.C. Public relations figure

1360
01:20:20,783 --> 01:20:23,684
“‘尖兵集团’有公开紧密关联的公关名人
"with known ties to defense contractor PointCorp

1361
01:20:23,753 --> 01:20:25,380
“于昨天被发现和国会员工…
"was yesterday linked to the death

1362
01:20:25,521 --> 01:20:27,182
“索尼娅・贝克的死有关”
"of Capitol Hill staffer Sonia Baker."

1363
01:20:27,256 --> 01:20:29,520
少来，你是记者？
Come on. Are you a reporter?

1364
01:20:29,592 --> 01:20:32,220
这样不好，这样很不好
This is not cool. This is definitely not cool.

1365
01:20:32,361 --> 01:20:34,090
非常不专业，我现在正坐着…
Very unprofessional. I'm just sitting here...

1366
01:20:34,163 --> 01:20:35,460
卡尔・麦卡弗雷，环球报的
<i>Cal McAffrey from the Globe.</i>

1367
01:20:35,598 --> 01:20:36,929
恭喜刚入职，送给你
Congratulations. Keep it.

1368
01:20:36,999 --> 01:20:39,160
这消息明天就上报，除非…
That's gonna run tomorrow unless

1369
01:20:39,235 --> 01:20:40,566
你今天就能告诉我我须要知道的东西
you can tell me what I need to know today.

1370
01:20:40,636 --> 01:20:42,433
- 我不这么认为 - 在后巷我有辆车
I don't think so. I got a car out the back.

1371
01:20:42,505 --> 01:20:44,632
我知道一个舒服、安全地方 我们可以去那谈
I got a nice, safe place where you and I can talk.

1372
01:20:44,707 --> 01:20:48,143
嘿，嘿，开萨博的 我什么事情都不知道，明白吗？
Hey, hey, Saab. I don't know anything about anything, all right?

1373
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:50,269
我是公共人物，明白？
I'm a PR guy. Got it?

1374
01:20:50,346 --> 01:20:52,143
就作你的公共人物吧，两条路给你选
Be that as it may, there's two ways

1375
01:20:52,214 --> 01:20:54,182
这篇文章可以这样发表，多米尼克
this article can run, Dominic.

1376
01:20:54,483 --> 01:20:57,611
没你的名字，或者有你的名字
Without your name or with your name,

1377
01:20:57,687 --> 01:21:00,178
或者还有一张你网站上的照片
and maybe even a photo from your website.

1378
01:21:00,256 --> 01:21:03,783
那么，谁知道谁会被惹火呢？ 而且有多生气呢？
Now, who knows who that's gonna piss off and how badly?

1379
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:06,191
我在努力帮你，多米尼克，明白吗？
I'm trying to be your friend, Dominic, all right?

1380
01:21:06,262 --> 01:21:10,028
我不想看到你像索尼娅・贝克一样 被一辆列车了结
I'd hate to see you end up under a train like Sonia Baker.

1381
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:13,668
但你保证过我的名字从不见报，好吗？
And you promised never to use my name, right?

1382
01:21:13,736 --> 01:21:14,998
对，我说过
Yes, I did.

1383
01:21:15,071 --> 01:21:16,868
那地方会很舒适？很典雅？
This place is nice? It's classy?

1384
01:21:17,006 --> 01:21:18,803
- 我在那里会很舒服？ - 对
I'm gonna be comfortable? Uh-huh.

1385
01:21:38,027 --> 01:21:39,790
这是什么鬼地方？ （“美国佬旅馆”）
<i>DOMINIC... What kind of dump is this?</i>

1386
01:21:39,929 --> 01:21:41,726
你把我带到什么地方来了？
<i>Where have you brought me?</i>

1387
01:21:41,797 --> 01:21:43,321
小酒柜里没有酒
<i>No booze in the mini-bar.</i>

1388
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:45,663
电视不能点播
<i>There's no On Demand on the TV.</i>

1389
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:47,198
这是什么鬼旅馆？
<i>What kind of hotel is this?</i>

1390
01:21:47,269 --> 01:21:49,100
我说，有点汽车旅馆的样子，不是吗？
<i>Little bit more of a motel, I'd say, isn't it?</i>

1391
01:21:49,171 --> 01:21:51,002
没有人会在这里找到你，多米尼克
<i>CAL... Nobody's gonna find you here, Dominic.</i>

1392
01:21:51,073 --> 01:21:52,700
你酒调得怎么样，小甜豆
<i>DOMINIC... How are your beer-getting skills, sweet pea?</i>

1393
01:21:52,775 --> 01:21:55,107
给弗伊叔叔来一杯冰冻鸡尾酒如何？
<i>You want to go get Uncle Foy a nice frosty?</i>

1394
01:21:55,745 --> 01:21:56,973
- 我来给你计时 - 老天
<i>I'll time you. Christ.</i>

1395
01:21:57,079 --> 01:21:59,172
那么，我们从头开始吧
So, let's start from the beginning.

1396
01:21:59,315 --> 01:22:01,408
你在哪里遇见索尼娅・贝克的？
Where did you meet Sonia Baker?

1397
01:22:02,585 --> 01:22:04,109
为什么我们不从我的好处谈起呢？
Why don't we start with a little compensation?

1398
01:22:04,186 --> 01:22:07,519
那家伙刚才被吓青了脸，现在却要喝啤酒
This guy's stoned off his face, and now he wants a beer.

1399
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:09,558
- 我能来杯吗？ - 好
Can I have one? Yeah.

1400
01:22:09,625 --> 01:22:11,388
他到底在吃什么？
What's he taking exactly?

1401
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:14,657
老兄，镇静剂，这家伙胆都吓破了
Dude, downers. This guy's losing his shit.

1402
01:22:15,264 --> 01:22:18,324
- 为什么？ - 为什么？我帮你忙
For what? For what? Me helping you out.

1403
01:22:18,401 --> 01:22:20,767
我就要失去我的生意，我…
Me losing my business. Me...

1404
01:22:20,836 --> 01:22:22,861
这床真恶心
This bed's disgusting.

1405
01:22:23,005 --> 01:22:25,064
给我好处，明白？
Compensate me, okay?

1406
01:22:25,141 --> 01:22:29,043
好，你帮助我们侦破索尼娅的谋杀案 还要讲报酬
Okay, so you want to be paid to help solve Sonia's murder?

1407
01:22:29,111 --> 01:22:31,011
省省吧，好吗？我做公关的
(SIGHS) Save it, all right? I'm in PR.

1408
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:32,411
我对问问题的措辞还是有所了解的
I know a little bit about phrasing questions.

1409
01:22:32,481 --> 01:22:33,948
为什么你不试一下这么说：
Why don't you try phrasing it like this?

1410
01:22:34,016 --> 01:22:37,042
我愿意在帮你们出书之后接受报酬吗？
Would I like to be paid for helping you get a book deal?

1411
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:38,586
这里没人要出书
Nobody's here for a book deal.

1412
01:22:38,654 --> 01:22:40,053
真的？每个人都想出书呢
Really? Everybody wants a book deal.

1413
01:22:40,122 --> 01:22:42,386
而我想要我那份好处，明白吗？ 这样才公平
And I'd like my cut, okay? That's just fair.

1414
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:44,050
你什么时候遇见索尼娅的？
When did you meet Sonia?

1415
01:22:44,193 --> 01:22:45,785
好处，好处
Compensation, compensation.

1416
01:22:45,861 --> 01:22:47,294
你是来这里说明事实的，多米尼克
You came here to talk, Dominic.

1417
01:22:47,363 --> 01:22:50,389
知道吗，鼠辈 我是老手而我不喜欢这些废话
You know, mouse, I'm the talent and I don't like the vibe.

1418
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:52,832
所以你们不如改变一下方式，好吗？
So why don't you change that up, okay?

1419
01:22:52,902 --> 01:22:54,096
这房间不准吸烟
It's a non-smoking room.

1420
01:22:54,236 --> 01:22:55,430
是以你的名义登记的
It's under your name.

1421
01:22:56,338 --> 01:22:58,203
- 该给他用刑了 - 我喜欢这家伙
He's a douche. I love this guy.

1422
01:22:58,274 --> 01:22:59,969
我要给我律师打电话
<i>I want to call my lawyer.</i>

1423
01:23:00,109 --> 01:23:01,838
我觉得你应该觉悟了
<i>I think you should think that through.</i>

1424
01:23:01,911 --> 01:23:03,936
在这狗窝我们能收到信号吗？
<i>Can we get a signal in this rat hole?</i>

1425
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,514
为什么你不觉悟？嗯？
<i>Why don't you think it through? Hmm?</i>

1426
01:23:06,782 --> 01:23:09,273
多米尼克，让我再一次把这事情说清楚
Dominic, let me just lay this out for you one more time,

1427
01:23:09,351 --> 01:23:10,613
因为我觉得你还没有明白
<i>because I don't think you're getting it!</i>

1428
01:23:10,686 --> 01:23:12,278
- 所以我会向你说明，好吗？ - 放松
So I'll lay it out for you! Okay? Relax.

1429
01:23:12,354 --> 01:23:14,754
我会向你友好并明了地说明！
I'll lay it out for you nice and clear!

1430
01:23:14,824 --> 01:23:18,089
报社可以把这事以任何他们喜欢的方式扭曲
The newspaper can slant this any which way they want to,

1431
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:21,288
他们可以把你写成一个而且是唯一的 重要消息来源
and they can make you the one and only principal source.

1432
01:23:21,363 --> 01:23:22,660
你以为你那“尖兵集团”的朋友们…
How do you think that's gonna go down

1433
01:23:22,731 --> 01:23:24,255
- 最后会怎样？ - 肯定不好
with your friends at PointCorp? Not great.

1434
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:25,425
而其他和你有关联的人呢？
And anybody else you're connected to?

1435
01:23:25,501 --> 01:23:27,799
别这样，请不要这样
Don't do that. Please don't do that.

1436
01:23:33,809 --> 01:23:37,973
你说的越多，你给我们的材料越多
The more you talk, the more you give us,

1437
01:23:39,482 --> 01:23:41,143
你就被保护的越好
the more protected you are.

1438
01:23:41,283 --> 01:23:42,978
这才是我们应该做的
That's the way we work.

1439
01:23:44,954 --> 01:23:47,889
而你的好处就是不被公开
And your compensation is your anonymity,

1440
01:23:48,524 --> 01:23:51,391
而这就是你能从我们这里得到的唯一好处
and that is all you're gonna get from us.

1441
01:23:58,033 --> 01:23:59,933
- 明白？ - 是的
Okay? Yeah.

1442
01:24:00,736 --> 01:24:02,226
好极了
Great.

1443
01:24:02,304 --> 01:24:03,430
好了，这边进行的怎样
DELLA: Okay, how's it going in here?

1444
01:24:03,506 --> 01:24:05,474
听起来好的要命 我们就要准备好了
Sounds frigging great. We're just about ready.

1445
01:24:05,875 --> 01:24:07,433
- 我们开始吧 - 好极了，很好
Let's do it. DELLA: Great. Good.

1446
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:08,499
来吧
Come on.

1447
01:24:08,577 --> 01:24:10,044
我不干，我来打头阵
I'm not gonna do it. I'm gonna open the door,

1448
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:11,340
然后这事让你来说
and I'm gonna let you say it.

1449
01:24:11,413 --> 01:24:12,607
你必须要和她谈谈
You have to talk to her.

1450
01:24:12,681 --> 01:24:14,080
卡尔要我们拖后期限
Cal is asking us to push the deadline.

1451
01:24:14,150 --> 01:24:15,481
我们实在不能再继续…
We really can't afford to keep doing

1452
01:24:15,551 --> 01:24:16,813
- 做这样的事了 - 他们到底在哪儿？
this type of thing. Where the hell are they?

1453
01:24:16,886 --> 01:24:18,717
你说得好像我应该知道？
(EXCLAIMS) You saying that as if I should know?

1454
01:24:18,787 --> 01:24:19,981
是啊，你不刚和他谈过吗？
Yeah, well, you just spoke to him.

1455
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:21,682
是啊，他们没说在哪儿啊
Yeah, well, they didn't tell me where they were.

1456
01:24:21,757 --> 01:24:22,917
2万美元一小时啊
$20,000 an hour.

1457
01:24:22,992 --> 01:24:24,425
好…好了！
Yeah... All right!

1458
01:24:24,493 --> 01:24:25,960
走开
Bugger off!

1459
01:24:32,301 --> 01:24:33,290
该死
Shit.

1460
01:24:36,539 --> 01:24:41,101
就是这个男人，明白吗，从俱乐部认识的 好吧？
It was just this guy, okay, that I knew from the clubs, all right?

1461
01:24:41,177 --> 01:24:43,441
而他在一家公关公司工作，非常大的一家
And he worked for a PR firm, a very big one.

1462
01:24:43,512 --> 01:24:45,480
- 名字呢？ - 那…不，我不会把他名字说出来
Name? And... No, I'm not gonna give you his name.

1463
01:24:45,548 --> 01:24:48,073
他是位朋友，明白吗？他有…
He's a friend, okay? He had this, uh...

1464
01:24:48,217 --> 01:24:49,548
他有…
He had this...

1465
01:24:49,618 --> 01:24:50,915
他工作的公司有一个客户
Well, the company that he worked for had a client,

1466
01:24:50,986 --> 01:24:53,181
- 一个十分特殊的客户 - 名字？
a very special client. Name?

1467
01:24:53,756 --> 01:24:56,224
这个我可以给你，“尖兵集团”
I'll give you that one. PointCorp.

1468
01:24:56,292 --> 01:24:58,453
而他们需要一个特殊的人员
And they wanted a special employee.

1469
01:24:59,528 --> 01:25:01,291
他们需要一个女孩
<i>They needed a girl.</i>

1470
01:25:02,731 --> 01:25:04,995
我想到了索尼娅
I thought of Sonia.

1471
01:25:09,038 --> 01:25:10,471
你明白了吗？
You got that?

1472
01:25:12,908 --> 01:25:16,173
对不起 你的意思是索尼娅在为“尖兵集团”工作？
I'm sorry, are you saying that Sonia was working for PointCorp?

1473
01:25:16,312 --> 01:25:18,143
就像一个精心布置的陷阱
Like a steel trap, this one.

1474
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:20,111
别把这消息放给其他报纸了
Don't lose her to another paper.

1475
01:25:20,182 --> 01:25:21,206
对，这就是我想说的
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1476
01:25:21,283 --> 01:25:23,114
大声点，大声点
Turn it up, turn it up.

1477
01:25:23,352 --> 01:25:25,081
她是完美的人选，她很有胆识
<i>DOMINIC... She was a perfect fit. She had balls.</i>

1478
01:25:25,154 --> 01:25:27,145
- 她很聪明 - 她有欠债
She was smart. She was in debt.

1479
01:25:27,223 --> 01:25:28,383
而且有欠债，没错
And she was in debt, exactly. Yeah.

1480
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:31,392
他们每个月给她支付2万6千元
They paid her $26,000 a month.

1481
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:32,791
比他们给我的还要多得多
Whole hell of a lot more than they gave me.

1482
01:25:32,861 --> 01:25:33,919
- 他们只给我了20 - 这可是大新闻
<i>They paid me a flat 20. It's big.</i>

1483
01:25:33,996 --> 01:25:35,395
他们有告诉你她的任务吗？
Did they tell you what the job was?

1484
01:25:35,464 --> 01:25:37,329
没有，没告诉我 但是她告诉我了
No, they did not. She told me what it was, though.

1485
01:25:37,399 --> 01:25:38,491
她把柯林斯的事情告诉我了
She told me about Collins.

1486
01:25:38,567 --> 01:25:39,966
她说了她要做卧底
She told me about spying on him.

1487
01:25:40,436 --> 01:25:43,234
他们有要求索尼娅和柯林斯睡觉吗？
And did they want Sonia to sleep with Collins?

1488
01:25:43,305 --> 01:25:45,569
没有，她自己惹上这麻烦的…
No. She got on her back all by herself

1489
01:25:45,708 --> 01:25:48,006
然后把所有事情都搅乱了，不是吗？
and screwed everything up, didn't she?

1490
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:50,570
他们怎样把她安插进柯林斯的团队的？
How did they get her onto Collins' staff?

1491
01:25:50,646 --> 01:25:52,477
我不会告诉你这个的，你可以死心了
That I'm not gonna tell you. You can forget it.

1492
01:25:52,548 --> 01:25:55,813
你可以绑架再折磨另一个人来得到这个消息
You can kidnap and torture someone else for that toughie.

1493
01:25:55,884 --> 01:25:57,010
- 我们有约定 - 是的
We have a deal. Yeah.

1494
01:25:57,086 --> 01:25:59,077
- 我的任务完成了 - 这里没有人会告发你
I've done my work. Nobody's here to screw you,

1495
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:02,817
但我们必须知道国会里是谁在做这项工作
but we need to know who was working this on the Hill.

1496
01:26:02,891 --> 01:26:04,119
不不
Mmm-hmm.

1497
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:08,327
国会的人，是吗？ 国会里，他们找到一个人来处理这事
From the Hill, huh? Well, from the Hill, they found a guy to fix it.

1498
01:26:08,397 --> 01:26:09,728
- 名字？ - 不
Name? No.

1499
01:26:10,099 --> 01:26:11,691
- 是谁？ - 别问了
Who? Leave it.

1500
01:26:11,767 --> 01:26:12,961
- 谁？ - 拜托
Who? Come on.

1501
01:26:13,035 --> 01:26:14,195
怎么，你们听不到我说话？
<i>What, are you not hearing me?</i>

1502
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:16,500
算了吧，说出来的话…
Forget it. I'd be afraid to start that

1503
01:26:16,572 --> 01:26:19,040
我会连每天发动我那卡迪拉克都得小心
sweet ass Caddy every morning.

1504
01:26:20,342 --> 01:26:21,934
我说，如果是我在开你那辆萨博老爷车…
I mean, keep in mind if I was driving

1505
01:26:22,011 --> 01:26:23,535
我就会十分小心
that wheelbarrow Saab of yours,

1506
01:26:23,612 --> 01:26:26,137
我甚至可能把自己炸到天上去
I'd probably blow it up myself with me in it.

1507
01:26:27,149 --> 01:26:30,585
你见过那玩意儿吗？简直就像剪草机
You seen that thing? It's like a lawnmower.

1508
01:26:30,653 --> 01:26:32,951
我去给你拿瓶啤酒
I'm gonna get you another beer.

1509
01:26:33,656 --> 01:26:34,918
嘿
Hey.

1510
01:26:35,658 --> 01:26:36,682
喂
Oi.

1511
01:26:36,759 --> 01:26:39,250
你和那家伙睡过吗？
Are you sleeping with that guy?

1512
01:26:40,929 --> 01:26:42,487
我说，你在这干什么？
I mean, what are you doing here?

1513
01:26:42,631 --> 01:26:44,690
你和他睡过吗？啊？
Are you sleeping with him? Hmm?

1514
01:26:44,767 --> 01:26:47,258
还是你有男人了 你有男人了，对吧？
Or you got a guy. You got a guy, right?

1515
01:26:48,070 --> 01:26:49,435
当娜？
<i>DOMINIC... Donna?</i>

1516
01:26:49,938 --> 01:26:51,496
- 黛拉 - 黛拉
<i>DELLA... Della. DOMINIC... Della.</i>

1517
01:26:52,408 --> 01:26:55,809
我认识男人，也认识女人
I got a guy. Got a girl, too.

1518
01:26:56,245 --> 01:26:57,974
明白吗？我不想有人置身事外
Right? I don't want to leave anybody out.

1519
01:26:58,047 --> 01:27:00,140
嘿，史蒂芬，你怎么认识索尼娅的？
Hey, Stephen. How did you find Sonia?

1520
01:27:00,783 --> 01:27:02,011
什么？
STEPHEN: What?

1521
01:27:02,084 --> 01:27:03,278
她是怎么进入你的部门工作的？
How did she come to work in your office?

1522
01:27:03,352 --> 01:27:04,944
是谁…有人推荐她吗？
Was somebody... Did somebody recommend her?

1523
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:06,419
你说的什么？
What are you talking about?

1524
01:27:06,555 --> 01:27:07,988
我觉得你被玩弄了
<i>I think you've been played.</i>

1525
01:27:08,057 --> 01:27:09,046
真的？
Really?

1526
01:27:09,124 --> 01:27:10,716
谁介绍你们认识的？
<i>Who gave you her name?</i>

1527
01:27:10,926 --> 01:27:12,723
- 这是怎么回事？ - 这事不是胡闹
<i>What is this about? Don't dick around about this,</i>

1528
01:27:12,795 --> 01:27:14,262
史蒂芬，好吗？ 两个问题
Stephen, all right? Two questions.

1529
01:27:14,330 --> 01:27:15,820
她到底怎么进入你的部门工作的？
How the hell did she come to work in your office,

1530
01:27:15,898 --> 01:27:18,731
还有推荐她的那个人的名字
<i>and the name of the individual who recommended her?</i>

1531
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:25,506
菲戈斯，乔治・菲戈斯
Fergus. George Fergus.

1532
01:27:26,342 --> 01:27:29,106
说是他一位世交的女儿
<i>Said she was the daughter of an old family friend.</i>

1533
01:27:32,614 --> 01:27:33,842
道格・斯庞德的毕业派对
Doug Sponder's bachelor party.

1534
01:27:33,916 --> 01:27:36,407
还记得那家旅馆吗？“美国佬”？
<i>You remember that hotel, the Americana?</i>

1535
01:27:36,485 --> 01:27:37,679
记得
Yes.

1536
01:27:37,753 --> 01:27:42,247
现在就来，就自己 我在408房
Get here now, alone. I'm in Room 408.

1537
01:27:46,228 --> 01:27:47,559
我回头在办公室找你
I'll meet you at the office.

1538
01:27:47,629 --> 01:27:48,926
史蒂芬，我们已经迟到了
Stephen, we're late already.

1539
01:27:48,997 --> 01:27:50,055
我会联系你的
I'll call in.

1540
01:27:50,132 --> 01:27:51,827
史蒂芬，我们已经迟到了
Stephen, we are late already.

1541
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:52,924
我会联系你的，好吗？
I'll call in. Okay.

(SIGHS)

1543
01:28:03,011 --> 01:28:04,035
别听你的留言信箱
Don't check your voicemail.

1544
01:28:04,113 --> 01:28:07,514
卡梅隆对推迟发稿的事情大发雷霆
Cameron's going on a rampage about this deadline.

1545
01:28:07,583 --> 01:28:08,948
我要的部分有剪出来吗？
So, did you cue it where I asked?

1546
01:28:09,017 --> 01:28:10,348
基本上
HANK: Close enough.

1547
01:28:10,419 --> 01:28:13,752
好的，伙计们 我现在需要你们离开这房间
Okay. So, guys, I'm gonna need you to clear the room.

1548
01:28:13,922 --> 01:28:15,685
- 也包括你 - 什么？
That means you, too. What?

1549
01:28:18,694 --> 01:28:20,491
我把史蒂芬・柯林斯叫来了
<i>CAL... I got Stephen Collins coming in here.</i>

1550
01:28:20,562 --> 01:28:22,120
如果你不在这里的话…
It's gonna be a lot more comfortable for him

1551
01:28:22,264 --> 01:28:23,822
他会觉得自在点，明白吗？
if you're not here, all right?

1552
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:25,992
你不是开玩笑吧
Tell me you're kidding.

1553
01:28:28,303 --> 01:28:30,965
从什么时候起，这起调查的被调查人…
<i>DELLA... Since when does the subject of an investigation</i>

1554
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:33,530
可以优先观看另一个被调查人的录像了？
<i>get his own private preview of another subject's interview?</i>

1555
01:28:33,609 --> 01:28:34,974
这简直是疯了
<i>That's crazy!</i>

1556
01:28:35,043 --> 01:28:37,034
你这是在污染这篇报道
You're polluting the story!

特殊情况
Special circumstance.

1558
01:28:38,614 --> 01:28:40,206
什么？什么情况？
What? What?

1559
01:28:40,983 --> 01:28:43,281
是因为他是议员大人？ 还是因为他是你朋友？
Is it that he's a congressman, or that he's your friend,

1560
01:28:43,352 --> 01:28:45,411
或者你迷恋他的妻子？
or that you have a crush on his wife?

1561
01:28:45,487 --> 01:28:47,250
你能让我明白吗？
Could you fill me in here?

1562
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:49,548
以上所有
All of the above.

1563
01:28:49,625 --> 01:28:51,115
上帝，你真是个伪君子
<i>DELLA... Oh, my God, you're such a hypocrite!</i>

1564
01:28:51,794 --> 01:28:54,695
这报道我也参与其中 而你现在却要让他来…
<i>This is my story, too, and you are about to kill it forever</i>

1565
01:28:54,763 --> 01:28:56,424
永远地毁了它

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

01:28:59,301 --> 01:29:01,269
我会把他带进来
I'm gonna bring him in.

1568
01:29:01,403 --> 01:29:03,394
我会让他坐下，给他看这个
I'm gonna sit him down, show him this.

1569

我会让他留下记录
I'm gonna get him on the record,

01:29:19,788 --> 01:29:21,221
认识这个人吗？
(CLEARS THROAT) You know this guy?

1576

不
No.

你完全认不出他吗？

I don't know. Maybe. Is this in here?

1579
01:29:28,297 --> 01:29:31,391
不，另一间房 他睡着了
No, no, it's next door. He's sleeping it off.

1580
01:29:31,934 --> 01:29:33,595
坐吧
Sit down.

1581
01:29:34,436 --> 01:29:36,097
好
Okay.

This guy, Dominic Foy, he finds Sonia.

1584
01:29:46,748 --> 01:29:49,876
他收了钱 余下的工作由乔治・菲戈斯完成
He takes a fee. George Fergus does the rest.

1585
01:29:50,586 --> 01:29:51,712
不，这不可能
No. That's not possible.

1586
01:29:51,787 --> 01:29:55,188
他们帮她还债 而且还每月付钱让她把…
They paid off her debt, and they paid her monthly to report back

1587
01:29:55,324 --> 01:29:57,554
你做的每一件都报告回去
every single thing that you were doing.

1588
01:29:57,759 --> 01:30:01,354
而当她没有价值之后，他们谋杀了她
And when she went dry, they killed her for it.

1589
01:30:03,131 --> 01:30:04,928
你怎么知道？
How do you know this?

1590
01:30:08,237 --> 01:30:10,705
然后我接到一通电话 我必须要去到某条街的角落
<i>DOMINIC... And so I get a call, I gotta go down to a street corner.</i>

1591
01:30:10,772 --> 01:30:13,002
我要买本杂志，我要去见一个陌生人
<i>I gotta buy a magazine. I gotta meet some new guy.</i>

1592
01:30:13,108 --> 01:30:14,336
这家伙，知道吗？
<i>This guy, you know,</i>

1593
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:16,309
有着硬朗、粗脖子、健硕…
<i>he's some hardcore, thick-neck, corn-fed,</i>

1594
01:30:16,445 --> 01:30:18,379
海军或特种兵样子的男人，明白吗？
<i>Navy-SEAL-Iooking guy, you know?</i>

1595
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:21,142
然后他对着我的脸大声说话，把我吓得不行
<i>And he's all up in my face, scaring the hell out of me</i>

1596
01:30:21,216 --> 01:30:22,774
因为他非常生气，而且…
<i>because he's pissed off and...</i>

1597
01:30:22,918 --> 01:30:24,783
- 什么时候的事？ - 大约一个月前
When was this? DOMINIC: This is like a month ago.

1598
01:30:24,853 --> 01:30:26,616
明白吗？他很生气是因为…
You know, he's pissed off because

1599
01:30:26,755 --> 01:30:28,552
索尼娅不再给他任何情报
Sonia's not giving him anything anymore.

1600
01:30:28,624 --> 01:30:29,818
那他有要求你为此做些什么吗？
And what did he want you to do about it?

1601
01:30:29,892 --> 01:30:33,089
他要我解决这事 他要我好像解决我的吹风筒一样解决这事
He wants me to fix it. He wants me to fix it, like one of my hair dryers.

1602
01:30:33,161 --> 01:30:34,185
你做了吗？
And did you?

1603
01:30:34,329 --> 01:30:35,387
我试过
<i>I tried.</i>

1604
01:30:36,765 --> 01:30:38,699
我试过，我给她电话，但她不接
<i>I tried. I called. She wouldn't take my call.</i>

1605
01:30:38,767 --> 01:30:40,826
我去她那里，想和她谈谈
<i>I go over there. I try to talk to her.</i>

1606
01:30:41,069 --> 01:30:42,536
她就哭了
<i>She's crying.</i>

1607
01:30:42,638 --> 01:30:44,902
她为什么哭？有人恐吓她吗？
<i>DELLA... Why is she crying? She's scared somebody's after her?</i>

1608
01:30:44,973 --> 01:30:49,000
不，她哭是因为柯林斯，她爱上他了
<i>DOMINIC... No, she's crying because of Collins. She was in love with him,</i>

1609
01:30:49,344 --> 01:30:51,778
而且她怀孕了
<i>and she was pregnant,</i>

1610
01:30:56,218 --> 01:30:58,049
她还没有告诉他
<i>and she didn't tell him.</i>

1611
01:31:00,422 --> 01:31:02,515
她没有告诉他，而且，知道吗？
<i>She didn't tell him, and, you know,</i>

1612
01:31:02,591 --> 01:31:05,424
她还害怕如果他发现了她的所作所为…
<i>she was petrified that he's gonna find out what she did,</i>

1613
01:31:05,494 --> 01:31:06,859
就会抛弃她…
<i>and then he's not gonna want her,</i>

1614
01:31:06,929 --> 01:31:08,829
抛弃她和她的孩子
<i>and he's not gonna want the baby...</i>

1615
01:31:08,897 --> 01:31:11,593
她几乎为此而崩溃，她甚至烧掉了…
<i>She got so wrecked about it that she burned</i>

1616
01:31:11,667 --> 01:31:13,191
好几千美元的支票，那是好几次的酬劳
<i>thousands of dollars worth of paychecks.</i>

1617
01:31:13,268 --> 01:31:14,565
谁会这么干？
<i>Who does that?</i>

1618
01:31:14,903 --> 01:31:17,235
我试着去让她放松
<i>(SOBBING) And I tried to get her to just relax</i>

1619
01:31:17,372 --> 01:31:19,704
让她考虑考虑公开此事
<i>and to think about the publicity,</i>

1620
01:31:19,775 --> 01:31:24,439
或者考虑全身而退 或者考虑，就是，她的任务
<i>or think about an abortion, or think about, you know, her word.</i>

1621
01:31:24,513 --> 01:31:26,344
“继续你的任务，知道你的决定…
<i>"Just keep your word. And what about how</i>

1622
01:31:26,415 --> 01:31:28,212
“会对我有什么影响吗？”
<i>"your decisions are gonna affect me?"</i>

1623
01:31:28,283 --> 01:31:32,151
然后她就死了，明白吗？ 我听说是被谋杀了
<i>And then she's dead, you know? I hear it's a murder,</i>

1624
01:31:32,621 --> 01:31:33,952
所以我不想再和这事…
<i>and so I don't want anything more</i>

1625
01:31:34,022 --> 01:31:35,614
有任何关联了，明白吗？
<i>to do with this thing, you know?</i>

1626
01:31:36,391 --> 01:31:39,519
我很害怕，我想去一个温暖的地方
<i>I'm just terrified, and I want to go someplace warm,</i>

1627
01:31:39,595 --> 01:31:40,926
我想恢复清白
<i>and I want to come back to a clean slate.</i>

1628
01:31:40,996 --> 01:31:44,295
而你们写你们的文章，最好让他们别再烦我
<i>And you guys write your article and just get them off me.</i>

1629

01:37:17,699 --> 01:37:21,931
- 抱歉你说什么？ - 你听到了，世交先生
Pardon me? You heard me, family friend.

1719
01:37:28,243 --> 01:37:29,642
你真的以为你的新老板…
Do you really think that your new owners,

1720
01:37:29,711 --> 01:37:31,178
这些有责任心的全体国民…
these responsible corporate citizens,

1721
01:37:31,379 --> 01:37:36,112
会容许发布这篇…
are going to allow you to publish this

1722
01:37:37,052 --> 01:37:39,247
毫无根据的胡扯文章吗？
speculative drivel?

1723
01:37:40,488 --> 01:37:42,183
你甚至会在文末落款之前…
You are gonna be out of a job before

1724
01:37:42,257 --> 01:37:46,853
就丢掉这份工作的，小子
the devil can even say your name, son.

1725
01:37:50,665 --> 01:37:51,996
简宁
Janine.

1726
01:37:54,836 --> 01:37:57,805
索尼娅母亲的姓是简宁
Sonia's mother's first name is Janine.

1727
01:38:17,158 --> 01:38:18,352
你没有意识到重点
<i>CAL... You're missing the point.</i>

1728
01:38:18,426 --> 01:38:19,620
你没看到他的脸
<i>You didn't see his face.</i>

1729
01:38:19,694 --> 01:38:22,458
从他的脸上可以看出 菲戈斯才是这件事核心人物
<i>I saw his face. Fergus is at the heart of this story.</i>

1730
01:38:22,530 --> 01:38:24,691
这件事结束了，卡尔
<i>CAMERON... This story is dead, Cal.</i>

1731
01:38:24,866 --> 01:38:28,131
不管怎样，“尖兵集团”已经…
One way or another, PointCorp pushed

1732
01:38:28,203 --> 01:38:29,830
把索尼娅・贝克推到了撞死她的列车前
Sonia Baker in front of that train.

1733
01:38:29,904 --> 01:38:31,565
真的？问题是…
Really? The trouble is,

1734
01:38:31,639 --> 01:38:34,540
我们新的管理层不会让我们发布这些东西…
our new corporate owners won't let me print any of this

1735
01:38:34,609 --> 01:38:36,839
除非我们能让其中一个主角公开身份
unless I have one of the major players on the record.

1736
01:38:36,911 --> 01:38:39,505
要公开，卡尔！
On the record, Cal!

1737
01:38:40,048 --> 01:38:41,948
而唯一能这样做的人却不愿意
And the only person who could do that won't.

1738
01:38:42,017 --> 01:38:43,507
你能告诉我为什么吗？
Would you like to tell me why?

1739
01:38:43,585 --> 01:38:46,053
还是就因为你搞了人家老婆？
Or is it just that you shagged his wife?

1740
01:38:54,195 --> 01:38:56,026
或者你愿意向我解释如何、何时…
Maybe you'd like to explain to me how, when

1741
01:38:56,097 --> 01:38:58,292
还有为何“新传媒集团”让你变成胆小鬼的？
and why MediaCorp chopped off your balls.

1742
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:01,894
这件事要多大有多大 牵涉的要多广有多广
This is as big and as connected as it gets.

1743
01:39:01,970 --> 01:39:04,734
不管你往那一条分支追查，都是件大新闻
You follow any fissure of this, it's a massive story.

1744
01:39:04,806 --> 01:39:07,001
现在你有菲戈斯，你有“尖兵集团”
You got Fergus, you got PointCorp,

1745
01:39:07,142 --> 01:39:09,337
现在你又有了“新媒体集团”，都有联系
and now you got MediaCorp, all connected,

1746
01:39:09,477 --> 01:39:12,207
总结起来 他们都在为一家国家级俱乐部博弈
all in collusion, all playing for the same country club.

1747
01:39:13,014 --> 01:39:14,447
我还不知道你居然也加入了这场游戏
I didn't realize you'd taken up the game.

1748
01:39:14,516 --> 01:39:19,146
噢，卡尔，如果在这里有什么腐败堕落 也都是因你而起的
Oh. Oh, Cal, if there's any corruption involved here, it's coming from you.

1749
01:39:19,220 --> 01:39:22,485
你从一开始就让自己介入到这件事情中
You have injected yourself in this story right from the beginning,

1750
01:39:22,557 --> 01:39:24,149
而我们都知道原因
and we all know why.

1751
01:39:25,593 --> 01:39:27,959
这事完了，卡尔，只要你还有关联…
It's over, Cal, as far as you're concerned.

1752
01:39:28,029 --> 01:39:30,122
我保护不了你了
I can't protect you anymore.

1753
01:39:31,066 --> 01:39:33,899
而现在，我已经不确定我要保护你了
And right now, I'm not too sure I'd want to.

1754
01:40:01,429 --> 01:40:03,124
你想要新闻吗？
You want the story?

1755
01:40:06,034 --> 01:40:08,696
是的，来吧
Yeah. Come on.

(CLEARS THROAT)

1757
01:40:24,052 --> 01:40:29,012
我和索尼娅・贝克的初次见面…
I was first introduced to Sonia Baker

1758
01:40:30,091 --> 01:40:34,050
是在2007年4月
in April of 2007.

1759
01:40:35,763 --> 01:40:38,960
她被聘请作为我的团队的调查助理
She was hired as a research assistant on my staff.

1760
01:40:39,567 --> 01:40:44,129
她是多数党督导员…
She was recommended by the Majority Whip,

1761
01:40:45,106 --> 01:40:49,907
来自西维吉尼亚的议员 乔治・菲戈斯举荐的
Congressman from West Virginia, George Fergus.

1762
01:40:51,746 --> 01:40:57,616
在那里相处了三个月之后 索尼娅和我开始了一段…
Three months into her time there, Sonia and I began

1763
01:40:59,787 --> 01:41:02,585
浪漫的感情
a romantic relationship.

1764
01:41:03,491 --> 01:41:08,861
我已经给你电邮了一份档案 那些会确切地告诉你…
<i>STEPHEN... I have e-mailed copies of documents to you, which show beyond doubt</i>

1765
01:41:09,197 --> 01:41:11,859
我党党员内部的腐败堕落
<i>the corruption between members of my own party.</i>

1766
01:41:11,933 --> 01:41:17,200
现在我知道了她被作为一个间谍 安插在我的部门
I now know that she had been placed in my office as a spy.

1767
01:41:17,272 --> 01:41:19,433
“尖兵集团”的触手已经伸到了…
<i>PointCorp's tentacles reach into every corner</i>

1768
01:41:19,507 --> 01:41:21,407
不断增长的民营安保产业的各个角落
<i>of the ever-growing private security industry,</i>

1769
01:41:21,476 --> 01:41:22,966
不论国内或国外
<i>both at home and abroad.</i>

1770
01:41:23,044 --> 01:41:24,511
这不单止意味着十分…
<i>Not only does this pose a great...</i>

1771
01:41:24,646 --> 01:41:26,113
而且这也违反了我们的法律
<i>But it is a violation of our laws.</i>

1772
01:41:26,181 --> 01:41:27,239
一个垄断的商业…
<i>A monopolistic business...</i>

1773
01:41:27,315 --> 01:41:29,510
…妨碍干涉，或者直接毁掉
...obstruct and otherwise destroy

1774
01:41:29,651 --> 01:41:31,881
我对“尖兵集团”的深入调查
my investigation into PointCorp.

1775
01:41:32,820 --> 01:41:36,085
索尼娅定期向“尖兵集团”报告 从而领取报酬…
Sonia was paid to make regular reports to PointCorp...

1776
01:41:36,157 --> 01:41:38,853
如果任其发展，我相信5年之内
Left unchecked, I believe that within five years,

1777
01:41:38,927 --> 01:41:41,452
“尖兵集团”会在美国国土上 拥有自己的常备军队
PointCorp will have its own standing army on US soil.

1778
01:41:41,529 --> 01:41:42,826
…进入他们欺诈的行径…
<i>... into their fraudulent practices...</i>

1779
01:41:42,897 --> 01:41:45,263
这样会控制我们的情报收集部门…
<i>It will control our intelligence-gathering apparatus...</i>

1780
01:41:45,333 --> 01:41:48,097
调查委员会发生了什么… 她接触到了我们做的所有事情
What happened in committee... She had access to everything we were doing

1781
01:41:48,169 --> 01:41:49,830
成功地让我们的调查付诸流水
<i>and effectively crippled our investigation.</i>

1782
01:41:49,904 --> 01:41:53,863
这样带来的后果十分可怕，必须要予以制止
<i>It is a frightening vision and one which must be stopped.</i>

1783
01:41:55,643 --> 01:41:59,272
不论如何，当我们之间的关系越来越亲密
However, when my relationship with her grew,

1784
01:41:59,781 --> 01:42:02,807
她停止了为他们收集情报…
she ceased her spying on their behalf,

1785
01:42:02,884 --> 01:42:05,717
而我相信他们为此杀害了她
<i>and I believe they killed her for it.</i>

1786
01:42:08,856 --> 01:42:10,289
对于这些人，这些我花费…

就像不扔还会对他们不利一样
thought of as collateral damage.

1790
01:42:23,204 --> 01:42:26,435
我相信如果不是我自身职位的公众影响力…
<i>And I believe it was simply the public nature of my position that</i>

1791
01:42:28,276 --> 01:42:30,642

saved me from a similar fate.

So, as political suicides go,

觉得如何？
how was that?

还是通过手中的报纸…

01:46:33,354 --> 01:46:36,619
好吧，你多大了？说真的，别告诉我
So, how old are you? Actually, don't tell me.

1827
01:46:36,691 --> 01:46:38,249
那会让我不舒服的

听着，我看着你，我不到女孩 我只看到一个记者
Well, see, I look at you, and I don't see a girl. I just see a reporter.

01:46:43,631 --> 01:46:46,099

好的
Yes.

1832
01:46:48,169 --> 01:46:50,637
- 我在高中有一个英语老师 - 嗯
So I had this, uh, English teacher in high school. Mmm-hmm.

1833
01:46:50,705 --> 01:46:54,903
- 他是类似那种长头发嬉皮士的人 - 嗯
He was a kind of a longhaired hippie kind of guy. Mmm-hmm.

1834
01:46:55,510 --> 01:46:58,104
- 他也经常找不到笔 - 噢
He had a pen problem. Yeah. Oh.

1835
01:46:58,646 --> 01:47:00,477
他通过在脖子上…
He solved it by having a piece

1836
01:47:00,615 --> 01:47:02,446
带一个皮项圈解决了问题
of leather string around his neck,

1837
01:47:02,517 --> 01:47:03,950
他就把笔放在那上面
and that's where he'd keep his pen.

“我的朋友黛拉也经常找不到笔
"My friend Della's got a pen problem.

“我该怎么解决呢？”

1842
01:47:12,627 --> 01:47:14,561
- 然后我想到了这个 - 这是什么啊？
And I came up with this. What is it?

1843
01:47:14,629 --> 01:47:17,928
我叫它“努比亚公主黛拉・弗雷娅的…
I call it the "Della Frye Nubian Princess,

1845
01:47:21,469 --> 01:47:25,303

Oh, it's beautiful! I always wanted one of these.

好吧，我想告诉你安妮・柯林斯的一些事情
You know, I wanted to tell you something about Anne Collins.

1848
01:47:40,421 --> 01:47:41,718
好的
Okay.

我刚才和她说话的时候

安妮・柯林斯怎么知道…
How does Anne Collins know that

索尼娅・贝克一个月赚2万6千？
Sonia Baker was earning $26,000 a month?

1852
01:48:11,619 --> 01:48:12,711
什么？
What?

1853
01:48:15,256 --> 01:48:17,190

How does she know how much Sonia Baker was earning?

1854
01:48:17,258 --> 01:48:18,657

We know that. Yeah.

我是说，史蒂芬一定在弗伊的录像里听到了
Well, I mean, Stephen must have heard it in the Foy interview.

1857
01:48:26,567 --> 01:48:28,933
我们给他看的是经过剪辑的特别部分
We played him a specific part of that tape,

1858
01:48:29,070 --> 01:48:31,436
那内容没有被提及
and that figure is never mentioned.

Cal. Wait, what are you doing?

1860
01:49:04,005 --> 01:49:06,906
你在干什么？卡尔？
DELLA: What are you doing? Cal?

1861
01:49:13,214 --> 01:49:14,511
你不打算向我说明吗？
You gonna fill me in?

What? Cal? Cal!

1864

罗伯特・宾汉姆是谁，史蒂芬？
Who's Robert Bingham, Stephen?

1866

1870
01:50:30,791 --> 01:50:32,190
没有
No.

1871
01:50:34,495 --> 01:50:37,692
1991年在科威特我救了罗伯特・宾汉姆的命
I saved Robert Bingham's life in Kuwait in '91.

1872
01:50:38,699 --> 01:50:40,929
那是他只是个17岁的孩子
He was a 17-year-old kid.

1873
01:50:41,068 --> 01:50:43,298
他是个好士兵
He was a good soldier.

1874
01:50:43,370 --> 01:50:45,497
他为他所做的一切感到自豪
He was proud of what we did.

1875
01:50:46,373 --> 01:50:51,401
军队就是他的生命 而当他退伍的时候遇到了问题
The Army was his life, and he had problems when he got discharged.

1876
01:50:51,512 --> 01:50:54,447

So you had a guy that you knew to be unstable

1877
01:50:55,750 --> 01:50:58,810
去做什么？去恐吓她？
do what, exactly? Scare her?

1878
01:50:58,886 --> 01:51:00,183
或许还使用了点暴力？
Maybe beat her up a little?

1879
01:51:00,254 --> 01:51:02,916
不，卡尔，我让他跟踪她而已
No, Cal. I had him follow her.

1880
01:51:03,324 --> 01:51:04,313
为什么？
Why?

1881
01:51:04,391 --> 01:51:07,485
因为我知道她有事情瞒着我
Because I knew she was hiding something from me.

1882
01:51:08,662 --> 01:51:09,959
因为如果我在她家
Because when I'd... I'd be at her house

1883
01:51:10,030 --> 01:51:11,827
如果刚好有传真来，她会变得紧张
and a fax would come in, she'd get nervous.

1884
01:51:11,899 --> 01:51:14,493
因为甚至在深夜的时候也接到电话
Because there were phone calls late at night.

1885
01:51:14,568 --> 01:51:16,297
我起了疑心
I was suspicious.

1886
01:51:16,370 --> 01:51:20,101
我让宾汉姆去观察她然后向我报告
I asked Bingham to observe her and report back to me.

1887
01:51:20,174 --> 01:51:22,267
就这些
That's all.

1888
01:51:23,644 --> 01:51:24,770
你是个骗子，史蒂芬
You're a liar, Stephen.

1889
01:51:24,845 --> 01:51:27,609
对于她的所为，宾汉姆比我还难过
He was more upset about what she was doing than I was.

1890
01:51:27,681 --> 01:51:29,945
你必须了解军队对于他有什么意义
You have to understand what the military means to Bingham.

1891
01:51:30,017 --> 01:51:32,485
他恨“尖兵集团” 就是因为它对军队所做的一切
He hates PointCorp for what they're trying to do to it.

1892
01:51:32,553 --> 01:51:33,952
在他看来，她必须被制止
In his mind, she just had to stop.

1893
01:51:34,088 --> 01:51:35,521
但她已经收手了，不是吗？
But she did stop, right?

1894
01:51:35,589 --> 01:51:37,989
她撕掉了那些支票 而且还为你把自己的性命投入危险中
She tore up her paychecks, and she put her life at risk for you.

1895
01:51:38,058 --> 01:51:40,185
对，但我当时不知道
Yes, but I didn't know that.

1896
01:51:40,494 --> 01:51:43,224
我不知道他会杀了她
I didn't know that he was gonna kill her.

1897
01:51:43,798 --> 01:51:45,493
我不知道是他杀了她
I didn't know he had killed her.

1898
01:51:45,566 --> 01:51:47,500
当我知道时，我的想法和你们的完全一样
When I found out, my thought was just the same as yours.

1899
01:51:47,568 --> 01:51:49,433
我以为是“尖兵集团”干的
I thought PointCorp had done it.

你什么时候知道的？
And when you did find out?

1901
01:51:50,571 --> 01:51:51,560
那我该怎么做？
What was I supposed to do?

1902
01:51:51,639 --> 01:51:53,300
- 找人商量 - 我试过
Tell someone. I tried.

1903
01:51:53,374 --> 01:51:54,500
- 何时？ - 在我去你家的时候
When? When I came to your house,

1904
01:51:54,575 --> 01:51:55,803
那时我想和你谈谈这件事
and I wanted to talk to you about it,

1905
01:51:55,943 --> 01:51:56,967
而你所关心的只是报道
and all you cared about was the story.

1906
01:51:57,044 --> 01:51:59,638
不，史蒂芬，我关心的是怎么帮你
No, Stephen, I cared about helping you.

1907
01:51:59,713 --> 01:52:01,613
胡扯，胡扯
Bullshit. Bullshit.

1908
01:52:01,682 --> 01:52:04,310
你关心的是如何消除因为你和安妮之间 的那出肥皂剧…
All you cared about was clearing your conscience over this little soap opera

1909
01:52:04,385 --> 01:52:06,148
- …所引起的良心不安 - 所以你利用了我
you have with Annie. So you used me.

1910
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:07,585
- 不，卡尔 - 就好像你利用宾汉姆一样
No, Cal. The same way as you used Bingham.

1911
01:52:07,655 --> 01:52:09,520
我对她起了疑心，所以我让他参与进来
I was suspicious of her. I brought him in.

1912
01:52:09,657 --> 01:52:11,557
这就是全部事实！这是一个错误！
That's all it was! It was a mistake!

1913
01:52:11,659 --> 01:52:12,785
这是我的责任
It's my responsibility.

1914
01:52:12,927 --> 01:52:14,087
我就不应该这么做
I should never have done that.

1915
01:52:14,161 --> 01:52:16,288
但我从没要他杀了她
But I never asked him to kill her.

1916
01:52:16,430 --> 01:52:18,557
他欠你一条命
He owed you his life!

1917
01:52:20,534 --> 01:52:22,525
所以你才找到他
That's why you called him.

1918
01:52:23,270 --> 01:52:25,568
你找到他，然后就好像…
You called him, and you used him,

1919
01:52:26,407 --> 01:52:28,841
利用我一样利用他
like you've been trying to use me.

一个杀人，另一个掩盖真相

1921
01:52:32,947 --> 01:52:34,505
如果“尖兵集团”和菲戈斯没有聘请她
If PointCorp and Fergus hadn't hired her,

1922
01:52:34,582 --> 01:52:36,675
- 这些事情都不会发生 - 不，这不关宾汉姆…
none of this would've happened! No. This is not about Bingham

1923
01:52:36,750 --> 01:52:38,581

You know, it's laughable, your sense of your own self-worth.

1930
01:53:06,747 --> 01:53:08,874
那是为什么？因为没有人再读报纸了？
Why is that? 'Cause nobody reads the papers anymore?

1931
01:53:08,949 --> 01:53:10,746
是吗？
Is that it?

1932
01:53:10,951 --> 01:53:13,476
因为就像某些报纸，引起了几天的轰动
It's just another story, a couple days of shitstorm,
