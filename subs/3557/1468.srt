a topic for my doctorate.

Well, on the bright side,
you've invented window art.

This is a group

a non-singular event,
where nobody loses.

you know?

Well, you ended the war.

because I'm a lone wolf.

After?

828
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:42,735
So, we see that the zeroes
of the Riemann zeta function

correspond to singularities
in space-time.

Sometimes our expectations

That your husband,

01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:50,704
a mathematician with
no military training,

926
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:52,956
is a government spy
fleeing the Russians. . .

You're making him
sound crazy.

Or, that he has lost
his grip on reality?

01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:04,092
Now, the only way
I can help him is to
show him the difference

between what is real
and what is in his mind.

What's he been
working on?

933
01:11:18,483 --> 01:11:20,359
His work is classified.

934
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:25,656
He mentioned
a supervisor by the name
of William Parcher.

935
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:28,283
Maybe Mr. Parcher can
clarify things for us.

936
01:11:28,368 --> 01:11:31,203
But I can't get to
him without clearances.

say something?

01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:33,557
Alicia, I mean,
John has always
been a little weird.

946
01:12:33,641 --> 01:12:38,061
He said he was
doing code-breaking.
That it was eyes-only.

947
01:12:38,146 --> 01:12:41,565
Top-secret, part of

Was he?

948
01:12:41,649 --> 01:12:43,442
Well,
it was possible,

and flies to the tire
of bicycle "A,"

and so on and so forth,
until the two bikes collide

1425
01:58:07,330 --> 01:58:09,623
and the poor
little fly is squashed.

This is the important thing
about actually focusing in
and comprehending

1427
01:58:13,837 --> 01:58:16,756
the area that
you're dealing with.
Mathematics is very specific,

1428
01:58:16,840 --> 01:58:20,259
and it is an art form,
no matter what these people
around here will tell you,

1429
01:58:20,343 --> 01:58:21,844
especially the people
from Biology.

Don't listen to

Let me go back to
what you were doing before

I was thinking
that l might teach.

1436
01:58:34,566 --> 01:58:37,401
A classroom with 50 students
can be daunting for anyone.

John, besides,
you're a terrible teacher.

I'm an acquired
taste, Martin.

still might be something

Well, you know.
Are they gone?

No, they're not gone.

And maybe
they never will be.

1444
01:59:06,807 --> 01:59:07,807
But I've gotten
used to ignoring them,

they've given up on me.

my name is Thomas King.

Mmm-hmm.

you're being considered
for the Nobel Prize.

Forgive me, but I'm
just a little stunned.

Suddenly,

What about my work on
other some such projects,
like manifold embedding?

The application of

to FCC bandwidth auctions

Yes.

1482

I never would
have considered that.

Have I just reached
some level of honesty
that borders on stupidity?

No, you haven't.

Most commercially
available brands of tea

Northern Indian teas
which are dense enough.

that they have.

I have not been in this room
for quite some many years.

1495
02:02:08,697 --> 02:02:10,656

they serve.

the nominations for

It is onIy in the mysterious
