00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,560
Jeun Jee-hyun
Cha Tae-hyun

2
00:00:35,024 --> 00:00:39,862
MY SASSY GIRL

3
00:00:57,421 --> 00:00:59,131
Exactly two years ago today,

4
00:00:59,215 --> 00:01:04,053
she and l buried
a time capsule here.

5
00:01:05,012 --> 00:01:09,684
We promised to meet here
two years Later,

6
00:01:10,727 --> 00:01:14,397
but she hasn't come yet.

7
00:01:15,356 --> 00:01:17,817
I知 going to wait.

8
00:01:25,575 --> 00:01:26,743
Here we go.

9
00:01:27,577 --> 00:01:28,536
Please don't move.

10
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:30,413
One, two...

11
00:01:30,497 --> 00:01:31,706
Wait a minute.

12
00:01:36,086 --> 00:01:38,880
Hello? Oh, auntie.

13
00:01:39,506 --> 00:01:42,425
Sorry, I知 on my way.

14
00:01:43,093 --> 00:01:47,389
I知 really sorry. Yes, I知 coming.

15
00:01:48,265 --> 00:01:52,394
I知 having my photo taken.
Bye.

16
00:01:54,104 --> 00:01:55,564
Are you ready?

17
00:01:57,316 --> 00:01:58,775
Here we go.

18
00:01:59,776 --> 00:02:01,737
One, two...

19
00:02:03,822 --> 00:02:05,866
My parents wanted a daughter,

20
00:02:05,949 --> 00:02:08,786
so they raised me like one.

21
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:14,416
So l thought l was a girl
until l was seven.

22
00:02:18,962 --> 00:02:21,882
l had to go to the women's
public bath, too.

23
00:02:22,633 --> 00:02:24,134
The older l got,

24
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:27,888
l thought my penis would
get smaller and disappear.

25
00:02:28,722 --> 00:02:32,685
But it was the opposite.

26
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:42,069
First Half

27
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:44,488
He hasn't changed at all.

28
00:02:44,572 --> 00:02:46,991
No, I知 a real man now.

29
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:48,117
Hey, asshole.

30
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:51,579
Think clerical work in the
army makes you a man?

31
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,372
You irritate me!

32
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:55,458
Give me a break, asshole.

33
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,126
My job was tougher than you could imagine.

34
00:02:57,168 --> 00:02:59,670
Hey!! l worked near the DMZ.

35
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,048
Who are you kidding?

36
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:05,009
Hold it. Anyway, welcome back home.

37
00:03:05,802 --> 00:03:06,928
She's just my type.

38
00:03:07,011 --> 00:03:09,639
When I see my type,
I can't help it.

39
00:03:09,847 --> 00:03:11,516
l need to hit on her.

40
00:03:17,522 --> 00:03:19,274
Who's interrupting me?

41
00:03:19,357 --> 00:03:20,942
Hello? Who is this?

42
00:03:21,025 --> 00:03:23,319
Your mother, you bastard.
Oh, mom...

43
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,155
Why aren't you at your aunt's house?

44
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,949
I知 leaving soon.

45
00:03:30,035 --> 00:03:32,120
Keep quiet! It痴 my mom!

46
00:03:32,204 --> 00:03:33,330
Talk over there!

47
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:34,664
Make sure you pay a visit.

48
00:03:34,706 --> 00:03:36,625
It痴 been over a year since you saw her.

49
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:38,919
That long?

50
00:03:39,127 --> 00:03:43,048
You know she feels lonely after
losing her son last year.

51
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,425
She says you resemble him.

52
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,929
She'll be so glad to see you.

53
00:03:49,346 --> 00:03:50,889
Still there?

54
00:03:52,557 --> 00:03:54,685
We don't look alike.

55
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:59,231
Plus, l hate when she rubs
my face and kisses me.

56
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:00,691
Uncle does, too.

57
00:04:01,316 --> 00:04:04,486
She'll introduce you to a girl. Hey!

58
00:04:04,695 --> 00:04:07,364
l know the type she likes.

59
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:08,782
Tell her no thanks.

60
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:23,589
l want to meet a girl like the ones
in romantic comic books.

61
00:04:24,757 --> 00:04:26,258
But on that day...

62
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:20,981
She's my type, but l don't like her.

63
00:05:21,231 --> 00:05:22,315
Why?

64
00:05:23,149 --> 00:05:26,278
Drunk girls disgust me.

65
00:05:56,934 --> 00:05:59,436
Hey, get up!

66
00:05:59,728 --> 00:06:02,272
Offer your seat to the elder!

67
00:06:07,987 --> 00:06:08,779
Ugh!

68
00:06:15,369 --> 00:06:16,162
Go!

69
00:06:28,215 --> 00:06:29,091
Hey.

70
00:06:31,844 --> 00:06:33,930
Don't wear pink.

71
00:08:20,204 --> 00:08:21,289
Honey!

72
00:08:24,834 --> 00:08:25,835
She call him honey!

73
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:27,170
I知 not...

74
00:08:27,837 --> 00:08:28,629
What are you doing!

75
00:08:29,505 --> 00:08:30,590
I知 not...

76
00:08:31,215 --> 00:08:32,633
You handle this!

77
00:08:33,676 --> 00:08:35,511
I知 not...

78
00:08:35,595 --> 00:08:37,347
Think I知 stupid?

79
00:08:38,348 --> 00:08:39,432
Come here!

80
00:08:45,396 --> 00:08:46,648
Are you laughing?

81
00:08:47,482 --> 00:08:50,110
Why didn't you look after her?

82
00:08:51,236 --> 00:08:53,488
Hurry and do something!

83
00:09:16,386 --> 00:09:17,971
What are you doing?

84
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:29,858
I知 sorry.
Let me help with cleaning expenses.

85
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:34,029
Forget it. Just take care of her.

86
00:11:18,093 --> 00:11:20,178
Nothing's there when you need it.

87
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:24,850
Where did all those motels go?

88
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,645
l hate being with a drunk girl.

89
00:11:29,813 --> 00:11:32,775
Carrying her on my back is worse.

90
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:40,282
Wow, your honeys wasted.

91
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,077
No, it's not my fault.

92
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,454
Of course, it is. l know everything.

93
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,750
You see, we're engaged.

94
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,795
Western or Korean style?

95
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,797
Give me any room.

96
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:57,967
Room 405.

97
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,510
None on the first floor?

98
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,469
Fourth floor!

99
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,000
You forgot to check in.

100
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:37,716
It痴 40,000 won, kid.

101
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,552
What? 40,000 won?

102
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,930
Why? Find another place then.

103
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:48,560
Count it.

104
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,796
Hello?

105
00:13:41,329 --> 00:13:42,956
This phone's owner?

106
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:48,211
She's sleeping beside me.

107
00:13:49,171 --> 00:13:50,964
What? Here?

108
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:55,093
The Uk-su motel near Bupyung station.

109
00:13:59,097 --> 00:14:00,766
Better wash and leave fast.

110
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:05,604
Aha~!

111
00:14:34,717 --> 00:14:35,718
Hands in the air!

112
00:14:39,805 --> 00:14:40,765
What are you doing?

113
00:14:42,642 --> 00:14:43,559
Hands in the air!

114
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:49,273
Aaggh~~~~~~!

115
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,033
All of you.

116
00:14:56,158 --> 00:14:58,535
Eat one a piece, okay?

117
00:14:59,161 --> 00:15:00,412
Yes, boss.

118
00:15:00,496 --> 00:15:03,916
What are you looking at?
Look away.

119
00:15:06,335 --> 00:15:08,128
Gyeon-woo! You're out!

120
00:15:23,574 --> 00:15:24,784
Did you go to Bupyung?

121
00:15:25,743 --> 00:15:27,537
Yes, l did.

122
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:29,595
Come here!

123
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,472
Where did you sleep?

124
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,726
Your aunt said you didn't come!

125
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,269
And you're telling me a lie!

126
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,439
What happen to your sweater?

127
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,067
I知 such a poor guy.

128
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,529
All this cause of a drunk girl.

129
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,491
l wanna die.

130
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:55,830
You asked if l went to Bupyung!

131
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:58,959
l did, but not to see auntie!

132
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,795
What?

133
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:11,763
Bastard! Wait till he comes back.

134
00:16:12,881 --> 00:16:15,717
Know me now, right?
I知 a typical student.

135
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,179
An engineering major.
Study?

136
00:16:20,096 --> 00:16:21,973
I知 smart, but l never study.

137
00:16:22,224 --> 00:16:24,518
My parents can prove that.

138
00:16:26,061 --> 00:16:30,399
You're smart like me,
but studying is your problem.

139
00:16:30,982 --> 00:16:33,694
Since you inherited
your brain from me,

140
00:16:33,694 --> 00:16:38,323
you'll get good grades
if you study harder, idiot.

141
00:16:44,288 --> 00:16:46,540
Up four points in three years.

142
00:16:46,623 --> 00:16:49,001
Call this a report card?

143
00:16:49,793 --> 00:16:52,796
Since you inherited
your brain from your mom,

144
00:16:53,047 --> 00:16:55,841
you'll get good grades
if you study harder.

145
00:16:55,924 --> 00:16:59,386
lf you raise kids,
never tell them they're smart.

146
00:16:59,762 --> 00:17:01,263
They'll never study.

147
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,183
My goals?

148
00:17:04,934 --> 00:17:06,685
Haven't thought about it yet.

149
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:08,270
You know now?

150
00:17:09,021 --> 00:17:09,939
You got it.

151
00:17:10,481 --> 00:17:12,066
I知 a hopeless student.

152
00:17:16,487 --> 00:17:17,405
Hello?

153
00:17:17,488 --> 00:17:19,532
Who are you, asshole?

154
00:17:21,075 --> 00:17:23,494
What? Who's calling?

155
00:17:23,578 --> 00:17:25,872
Why were you naked
in a motel with me?

156
00:17:25,913 --> 00:17:26,497
What?

157
00:17:26,581 --> 00:17:27,373
Come out!

158
00:17:27,456 --> 00:17:29,083
To Bupyung station now!

159
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:30,460
Uh...

160
00:17:30,543 --> 00:17:31,711
How could she do this?

161
00:17:31,794 --> 00:17:35,381
l went to jail and got beaten
with a vacuum for her.

162
00:17:59,656 --> 00:18:01,074
Excuse me.

163
00:18:01,783 --> 00:18:02,492
Is it you?

164
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:03,910
Yes?

165
00:18:05,453 --> 00:18:06,580
Follow me.

166
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,042
Get over here.

167
00:18:21,595 --> 00:18:22,679
What do you wanna eat?

168
00:18:23,972 --> 00:18:25,057
Cherry jubilee...

169
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,434
Mango Tango or Shooting Stars...

170
00:18:27,684 --> 00:18:30,479
Jamonka Almonds good, too.

171
00:18:31,188 --> 00:18:33,398
I値l just have a Love Me.

172
00:18:33,482 --> 00:18:36,235
Hey, wanna die?

173
00:18:38,695 --> 00:18:39,738
Drink coffee.

174
00:18:41,407 --> 00:18:42,616
Two coffees.

175
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,785
You pay for it.

176
00:18:49,965 --> 00:18:50,800
Girl:Tell me.

177
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:52,343
What happened last night?

178
00:18:53,552 --> 00:18:55,137
Well, it's...

179
00:18:55,221 --> 00:18:58,849
You were drunk, so...

180
00:18:59,517 --> 00:19:02,395
Don't stumble, and speak clearly!

181
00:19:03,688 --> 00:19:05,314
You see.

182
00:19:05,398 --> 00:19:07,900
You were drunk and staggering
at the subway station.

183
00:19:07,984 --> 00:19:11,404
l saved you from the train.

184
00:19:12,488 --> 00:19:16,576
l thought maybe this girl was a snake.

185
00:19:17,327 --> 00:19:19,746
Pretending to be drunk
and vomiting

186
00:19:19,829 --> 00:19:22,832
to use the guy
in a state of confusion.

187
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:25,043
So l called you honey?

188
00:19:25,126 --> 00:19:26,502
That's right.

189
00:19:27,086 --> 00:19:29,464
l kind of remember that.

190
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,718
You showered to wash
off vomit and sweat,

191
00:19:34,511 --> 00:19:35,428
and the police came?

192
00:19:35,678 --> 00:19:36,679
Gyeon-woo:That's right.

193
00:19:38,348 --> 00:19:39,265
Would you believe that, too?

194
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:45,438
To a girl like this, you need to
show her who's the boss.

195
00:19:45,522 --> 00:19:47,023
So l did that, right?

196
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:48,900
Yes, you did.

197
00:19:56,241 --> 00:19:57,569
Sorry, it's late.

198
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:58,840
Yeah...

199
00:20:07,252 --> 00:20:12,382
When she's not drunk,
she's just my type.

200
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:19,348
You look prettier and livelier
than yesterday.

201
00:20:23,185 --> 00:20:24,853
Are you mocking me?

202
00:20:26,397 --> 00:20:28,983
No, I知 not.

203
00:20:31,068 --> 00:20:32,903
Then are you hitting on me?

204
00:20:35,698 --> 00:20:37,158
l don't wanna date you.

205
00:20:37,992 --> 00:20:41,579
We're not destined
for each other.

206
00:20:42,955 --> 00:20:44,040
Throw the trash away.

207
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,251
Damn it.

208
00:20:54,592 --> 00:20:56,385
l think she's a heavy drinker.

209
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,061
You order.

210
00:21:08,356 --> 00:21:11,317
Kimchi soup and Soju, please.

211
00:21:11,985 --> 00:21:13,695
Eat Golbangee.

212
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:16,656
Then you should order.

213
00:21:16,739 --> 00:21:18,199
Stop pouting!

214
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:19,909
Golbangee, please.

215
00:21:23,621 --> 00:21:25,331
Let's go somewhere fun later.

216
00:21:25,457 --> 00:21:27,042
Teenage girl 1 :l know what that means.

217
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:30,962
A motel? Are you rich?
-Of course.

218
00:21:31,046 --> 00:21:32,255
How much will you give us?

219
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:34,215
We'll see, so don't worry.

220
00:21:36,718 --> 00:21:38,929
You kids are prostituting, huh?

221
00:21:39,971 --> 00:21:42,474
Why'd you order Golbangee?
Eat something else!

222
00:21:42,516 --> 00:21:45,352
Teenage girl 1 :What's it to you?
Mind your own business.

223
00:21:45,435 --> 00:21:49,356
We're just having a drink with
some friends. What's wrong?

224
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:52,317
You take friends to a motel?

225
00:21:52,943 --> 00:21:54,236
How old are you kids?

226
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:57,239
Teenage girl 1 :Old enough to drink.
Mind your own business.

227
00:21:57,322 --> 00:21:59,950
Think I知 doing this
'cause you're drinking?

228
00:22:00,284 --> 00:22:02,286
Show me your lD.
You, too.

229
00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:03,745
Teenage girl 1 :What's with you?

230
00:22:03,829 --> 00:22:05,622
Show it, now.

231
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,208
Teenage girl 1 :This sucks.

232
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,922
She's a vicious chick.
No matter how pretty she is,

233
00:22:14,006 --> 00:22:16,842
I知 too embarrassed to be with her.

234
00:22:16,925 --> 00:22:19,345
Who are you to butt
in other people's business?

235
00:22:19,428 --> 00:22:23,682
Don't you have a daughter?
l don't. Bear me one.

236
00:22:23,766 --> 00:22:26,727
Who the hell do you think
you are?

237
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:28,395
How dare you?
Come on, let's fight!

238
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:30,356
Come on! I値l show you.

239
00:22:31,524 --> 00:22:33,109
Don't live like that!

240
00:22:33,859 --> 00:22:35,444
Catch the girls.

241
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:47,456
Have a drink and calm down.

242
00:23:03,932 --> 00:23:05,683
Shit!

243
00:23:13,316 --> 00:23:14,526
Ah~!

244
00:23:18,905 --> 00:23:25,704
Huk~!

245
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:29,791
Seeing a girl cry
makes me sad for some reason.

246
00:23:31,251 --> 00:23:36,506
She's more attractive
the closer l look at her.

247
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:40,861
Did you blow
your nose on this?

248
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:42,988
No.

249
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:54,499
Huk~ huk~ huk~~~!

250
00:24:06,887 --> 00:24:08,180
Please stop crying.

251
00:24:08,972 --> 00:24:09,973
Also...

252
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:13,519
The handkerchief is mine.

253
00:24:32,455 --> 00:24:34,331
To be honest,

254
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:41,088
l broke up with
my boyfriend yesterday.

255
00:24:46,093 --> 00:24:47,053
Excuse me.

256
00:24:47,678 --> 00:24:49,430
Wake up.

257
00:24:50,181 --> 00:24:53,351
Come on, wake up.

258
00:24:55,103 --> 00:24:57,730
Your fiances wasted again?

259
00:25:22,964 --> 00:25:25,091
What now?

260
00:25:25,175 --> 00:25:27,510
Sign you in like before, right?

261
00:25:30,972 --> 00:25:31,598
Yes.

262
00:25:33,141 --> 00:25:35,977
But mister, have any medicine
for alcohol?

263
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,939
No, you buy it.

264
00:27:08,422 --> 00:27:10,090
l saw her lips.

265
00:27:12,134 --> 00:27:13,927
Her white neck.

266
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:16,889
And...

267
00:27:19,725 --> 00:27:21,685
l saw her breast, too.

268
00:27:24,146 --> 00:27:29,109
While watching her
sleep like a baby,

269
00:27:29,902 --> 00:27:32,822
it may be forward,
but this occurred to me.

270
00:27:33,948 --> 00:27:37,535
l want to heal her sorrow.

271
00:28:02,477 --> 00:28:04,896
Give me some water.

272
00:28:11,444 --> 00:28:12,320
Hey.

273
00:28:13,822 --> 00:28:15,281
Why am l here?

274
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,952
You see.

275
00:28:21,287 --> 00:28:23,206
I知 sorry,

276
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:28,253
but l saw your lD,
and you're twenty-four.

277
00:28:28,336 --> 00:28:30,505
lf you talk down on me again...

278
00:28:32,507 --> 00:28:34,926
So what are you gonna do?
Just that...

279
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,219
Nothing.

280
00:28:36,303 --> 00:28:37,387
Give me the towel.

281
00:28:37,471 --> 00:28:42,434
Yes. You see, I知 a year older.

282
00:28:42,517 --> 00:28:44,811
Then talk like friends.
Yeah?

283
00:28:44,853 --> 00:28:45,729
Toothbrush.

284
00:28:51,693 --> 00:28:52,653
Toothpaste?

285
00:28:52,694 --> 00:28:54,112
In the bathroom.

286
00:29:03,956 --> 00:29:06,417
Our relationship
is so peculiar.

287
00:29:07,042 --> 00:29:12,298
We met only three days ago,
and slept twice in a motel.

288
00:29:16,677 --> 00:29:20,389
That's how our
relationship began.

289
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:23,309
Lee Hyung-chul.

290
00:29:23,392 --> 00:29:24,226
Here.

291
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,186
Jeun Mi-young.

292
00:29:25,269 --> 00:29:25,936
Here.

293
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,104
Kang Man-gyu.

294
00:29:27,188 --> 00:29:27,938
Yep.

295
00:29:28,606 --> 00:29:29,357
Gyeon-woo.

296
00:29:30,483 --> 00:29:31,359
Is he absent?

297
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,193
No, no!

298
00:29:32,276 --> 00:29:33,736
I知 here!

299
00:29:33,819 --> 00:29:36,030
Then answer right away.

300
00:29:36,822 --> 00:29:37,615
Phew! Gonna be sucks!

301
00:29:37,698 --> 00:29:38,449
Lee Jeung-min.

302
00:29:38,533 --> 00:29:39,492
Here.

303
00:29:40,076 --> 00:29:40,868
Gu Seol-soo.

304
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,161
Yes, I知 here.

305
00:30:38,135 --> 00:30:42,014
Professor. How about a break?

306
00:30:44,808 --> 00:30:48,270
You're right. Let's take a break.

307
00:30:50,939 --> 00:30:51,690
Let's go.

308
00:30:52,649 --> 00:30:55,277
Go where?
Class isn't over yet.

309
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,490
Don't be a coward.
He called roll, right?

310
00:31:00,157 --> 00:31:01,200
Let's go.

311
00:31:01,867 --> 00:31:04,828
l can't. l can't miss this class.

312
00:31:05,537 --> 00:31:06,914
Kill me instead.

313
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:11,085
All right.

314
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:18,050
Who is she? She's pretty.

315
00:31:18,884 --> 00:31:21,679
Pretty? Doesn't matter.

316
00:31:21,762 --> 00:31:23,848
A girl needs to act pretty.

317
00:31:23,931 --> 00:31:26,892
But she's still pretty.
Nice body, too.

318
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:32,315
Who's Gyeon-woo?

319
00:31:34,817 --> 00:31:37,069
It's me, sir.

320
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:41,949
l won't mark you absent
so you can leave.

321
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:43,993
Pardon me?

322
00:31:44,077 --> 00:31:45,495
l said leave.

323
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:47,747
Why?

324
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,916
Wasn't that girl
your girlfriend?

325
00:31:52,252 --> 00:31:53,878
So go see her.

326
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:58,800
Thank you, sir.

327
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,763
Oh, Gyeon-woo.

328
00:32:05,181 --> 00:32:08,268
lf you can, raise it with her.

329
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:12,856
It worked.

330
00:32:15,108 --> 00:32:17,194
What did you tell him?

331
00:32:18,361 --> 00:32:20,280
That I知 getting an abortion,
and you're the father.

332
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,033
What?

333
00:32:24,076 --> 00:32:27,996
No, no!
Professor, it's not true!

334
00:32:59,582 --> 00:33:02,168
She wanted
to be a scriptwriter,

335
00:33:02,251 --> 00:33:04,128
so she kept writing stories.

336
00:33:04,211 --> 00:33:06,422
She called them synopsis.

337
00:33:07,089 --> 00:33:11,344
To get me into the mood, she took me
to the park to read them.

338
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,557
Reading her synopsis
was stressful.

339
00:33:17,266 --> 00:33:20,311
lf l miss anything, I知 dead.

340
00:33:20,394 --> 00:33:23,147
Wanna die?
Finish reading it.

341
00:33:27,944 --> 00:33:28,820
l will.

342
00:33:41,374 --> 00:33:44,878
Mister! How could
you throw the butt here?

343
00:33:44,961 --> 00:33:46,171
Pick it up!

344
00:33:50,133 --> 00:33:52,969
And why did you
wear that colour?

345
00:33:53,053 --> 00:33:56,222
Man on the street:
Then what about you?

346
00:33:56,306 --> 00:33:58,058
Don't wear the same
colour as mine!

347
00:33:58,141 --> 00:34:00,977
The heroine is
tough, like the 'Terminator'.

348
00:34:01,061 --> 00:34:03,188
The year is 2137.

349
00:34:03,271 --> 00:34:07,776
Villains kidnap her lover
and travels to the present.

350
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:09,277
l don't know why.

351
00:34:09,319 --> 00:34:12,197
To save her lover,

352
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,742
she travels in a time machine
to the present.

353
00:34:37,473 --> 00:34:39,933
Aaggggggghh~!

354
00:34:40,517 --> 00:34:43,520
Bang! Bang!

355
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,024
Uuh~ ack!

356
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,451
Fizz~ Bang!

357
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,833
Click!

358
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,750
Bang!

359
00:35:06,919 --> 00:35:08,337
Uuuaaaaahh~~~

360
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:46,876
Bang! bang! bang!

361
00:35:54,175 --> 00:35:56,052
They have to kiss in the end.

362
00:35:57,095 --> 00:36:01,308
This isn't a melodrama.
It痴 an action movie.

363
00:36:01,391 --> 00:36:03,560
You don't know movies.

364
00:36:03,602 --> 00:36:06,438
Koreans like melodramas.

365
00:36:06,521 --> 00:36:07,647
Why?

366
00:36:07,731 --> 00:36:12,152
Know what novel touched us
when we were teenagers?

367
00:36:12,235 --> 00:36:14,655
Shower by Hwang Sun-won.

368
00:36:14,738 --> 00:36:18,742
It shaped our people's
sensibility in their teens.

369
00:36:18,825 --> 00:36:22,746
Koreans like sad movies
all because of 'Shower'.

370
00:36:23,288 --> 00:36:26,375
Shower? What's sad about it?

371
00:36:26,959 --> 00:36:28,961
It痴 sad when she asked

372
00:36:29,002 --> 00:36:32,256
to be buried in the clothes
reminiscent of her love.

373
00:36:32,297 --> 00:36:34,758
l couldn't sleep for one week.

374
00:36:35,801 --> 00:36:36,927
The ending sucks.

375
00:36:37,928 --> 00:36:38,929
Gotta change it.

376
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,431
How?

377
00:37:18,928 --> 00:37:23,141
It痴 sad. Her family couldn't afford
to pay for her medicine.

378
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:28,354
Their family line
is broken up now.

379
00:37:32,901 --> 00:37:38,156
But you know, she must have
been an extraordinary girl.

380
00:37:38,865 --> 00:37:39,407
Why?

381
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:41,034
This was her last request.

382
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:46,164
When l die, please bury me
with my loving friend.

383
00:37:46,623 --> 00:37:47,499
What?

384
00:37:47,749 --> 00:37:50,126
To bury him alive, even.

385
00:37:50,544 --> 00:37:52,045
Oh, my gosh.

386
00:37:53,922 --> 00:37:56,258
What's the matter?
What's wrong?

387
00:38:04,558 --> 00:38:06,059
No way!

388
00:38:06,143 --> 00:38:11,940
This is wrong!
This is wrong!

389
00:38:15,402 --> 00:38:16,987
This is wrong!

390
00:38:19,364 --> 00:38:21,992
Please. Don't!

391
00:38:24,036 --> 00:38:24,703
Bury him!

392
00:38:30,793 --> 00:38:34,797
They bury him alive.
Isn't it sad?

393
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:01,908
l must be hurt still.

394
00:39:07,622 --> 00:39:13,586
l think I値l never get over him.

395
00:39:20,622 --> 00:39:21,873
How deep could it be?

396
00:39:24,459 --> 00:39:25,252
l don't know.

397
00:39:26,294 --> 00:39:28,421
Gyeon-woo, go in the water.

398
00:39:28,505 --> 00:39:30,757
l wanna know how deep it is.

399
00:39:32,926 --> 00:39:34,469
Come on.

400
00:39:35,804 --> 00:39:37,264
Uuaaaah~!

401
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:45,564
Help me!
Help me!

402
00:39:45,647 --> 00:39:47,733
Wow, it's deep.

403
00:39:49,193 --> 00:39:51,612
l can't swim!

404
00:39:55,741 --> 00:39:56,533
Yes, it's deep...

405
00:39:56,617 --> 00:39:59,286
My mind was getting blurry.

406
00:40:01,497 --> 00:40:02,456
At that moment...

407
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:12,619
Heard you
got a girlfriend.

408
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:14,726
Introduce me.

409
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:17,229
Really?
I知 serious.

410
00:40:17,312 --> 00:40:18,688
Is she pretty?

411
00:40:19,064 --> 00:40:20,816
Have you kissed her?

412
00:40:21,316 --> 00:40:24,277
Girlfriend?

413
00:40:24,528 --> 00:40:26,989
Gonna introduce me or not?

414
00:40:28,699 --> 00:40:29,616
She really pretty?

415
00:40:31,535 --> 00:40:32,828
What are you looking at?

416
00:40:35,956 --> 00:40:37,833
See that girl over there?

417
00:40:38,542 --> 00:40:41,336
She's my girlfriend from today.
Got it?

418
00:41:10,866 --> 00:41:13,494
Hey...

419
00:41:13,577 --> 00:41:14,996
Excuse me...

420
00:41:15,538 --> 00:41:16,622
Hey, baby.

421
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:21,252
Are you free?
Hey?

422
00:41:22,003 --> 00:41:22,837
What?

423
00:41:23,421 --> 00:41:24,547
Baby?

424
00:41:26,132 --> 00:41:27,925
Hey! Come here.

425
00:41:37,977 --> 00:41:38,895
Hmm!

426
00:41:43,837 --> 00:41:48,466
How could
a coincidence like this happen?

427
00:41:49,259 --> 00:41:52,220
Reportedly say there is
an accident of runaway soldier...

428
00:41:57,309 --> 00:41:58,601
Hello?

429
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:07,674
You call a wrong number
or the dial is not in service.

430
00:42:07,757 --> 00:42:10,427
Please, call again.

431
00:42:10,927 --> 00:42:15,390
You call a wrong number
or the dial is not in service.

432
00:42:15,474 --> 00:42:17,059
Please, call again.

433
00:42:20,655 --> 00:42:24,742
Let's drink.
Drink till we die.

434
00:42:29,364 --> 00:42:30,615
Since I知 drunk,

435
00:42:30,991 --> 00:42:38,248
l decided to take revenge on her.

436
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:42,586
lf I知 out cold
at Bupyung station,

437
00:42:43,253 --> 00:42:47,466
then she'll have to carry
me on her back.

438
00:43:07,027 --> 00:43:11,198
This stop is Bupyung station...

439
00:43:17,538 --> 00:43:21,709
Hey, kid.
Wake up. Wake up.

440
00:43:23,085 --> 00:43:25,588
Where am l?

441
00:44:11,176 --> 00:44:14,804
I知 at Inchon station.
Be here in 30 minutes.

442
00:44:32,948 --> 00:44:35,701
Wake up.
Get up, idiot.

443
00:44:35,742 --> 00:44:39,037
Go away, buttbrain.

444
00:44:40,414 --> 00:44:41,707
Talking back?

445
00:44:42,416 --> 00:44:47,671
Get up, bastard!
What the...

446
00:44:57,890 --> 00:44:59,141
How're you?

447
00:44:59,225 --> 00:45:01,435
Hi!

448
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:03,312
How are you?

449
00:45:04,647 --> 00:45:06,690
Oh, how is it going?

450
00:45:07,274 --> 00:45:10,152
What?
Go away, buttbrain?

451
00:45:11,487 --> 00:45:13,531
You got a bad mouth.

452
00:45:15,908 --> 00:45:19,537
I値l set you
straight the gangster's way.

453
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:20,955
On your head.

454
00:45:24,125 --> 00:45:25,126
Get up.

455
00:45:26,919 --> 00:45:32,592
Sit down. Get up. Sit down.
Roll right. Roll left.

456
00:45:34,093 --> 00:45:36,387
Do it right.
Keep going!

457
00:45:41,351 --> 00:45:44,270
What's going on there?
Stop fooling around.

458
00:45:45,772 --> 00:45:51,486
Hey!
You low-life thieves.

459
00:45:51,486 --> 00:45:53,196
What officer?
Keep quiet.

460
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:55,073
Low-life thieves?

461
00:45:56,741 --> 00:45:58,326
Damn it.

462
00:46:02,289 --> 00:46:06,626
Hey. Want some of this?
No thanks.

463
00:46:06,668 --> 00:46:08,295
Try it. It痴 delicious.

464
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:10,589
No.
Hey, boy.

465
00:46:11,298 --> 00:46:13,300
Pay attention to your elders.

466
00:46:13,341 --> 00:46:14,426
Eat it, buttbrain.

467
00:46:18,555 --> 00:46:22,517
l told you no.
How many times did l tell you?

468
00:46:22,601 --> 00:46:25,646
Am l your toy? Leave me
alone you petty thieves!

469
00:46:25,729 --> 00:46:31,819
Stop toying with me, you jerks!
It痴 humiliating!

470
00:46:33,695 --> 00:46:35,030
Oh, shit!

471
00:46:47,084 --> 00:46:48,836
Good morning.

472
00:46:51,714 --> 00:46:56,969
Keep quiet!
Thank you. Thank you.

473
00:47:05,144 --> 00:47:05,895
You bastard!

474
00:47:05,978 --> 00:47:08,272
Do that again,
and you're dead.

475
00:47:08,356 --> 00:47:10,524
What? Are you free, baby?

476
00:47:10,608 --> 00:47:12,735
Your English is good, too.

477
00:47:14,737 --> 00:47:17,198
Better behave!

478
00:47:19,117 --> 00:47:20,326
Wanna die?

479
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:28,137
Taste good?

480
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:32,225
It痴 so delicious.

481
00:47:32,775 --> 00:47:37,071
lf l sleep out, mom beats me with
whatever's in her hand.

482
00:47:37,155 --> 00:47:39,532
lf she's sweeping,
it's a broom stick

483
00:47:39,616 --> 00:47:41,951
lf she's cleaning,
it's a vacuum.

484
00:47:41,993 --> 00:47:45,663
When I知 lucky,
it's a cucumber or eggplant.

485
00:47:45,747 --> 00:47:49,292
So l have to come
at the right time.

486
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:15,801
You're not looking
at dirty pictures, right?

487
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:20,014
Of course not, dad.
You don't trust me?

488
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:24,518
No, l do.
Time for bed.

489
00:48:24,602 --> 00:48:27,522
Go to sleep.
Good night, dad.

490
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:45,757
Hi, Gyeon-woo.
My birthday's in two days.

491
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,468
You're dead if you forget.
Got it?

492
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:53,139
Since l like you so much,
better make me smile like this.

493
00:48:53,223 --> 00:48:54,516
Got it?

494
00:48:56,101 --> 00:48:57,102
l got it.

495
00:48:58,270 --> 00:48:59,688
Phew~~

496
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:01,314
Her birthday.

497
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:04,818
lf l prepare nothing,
she may murder me.

498
00:49:05,735 --> 00:49:08,113
l have a good idea.

499
00:49:08,155 --> 00:49:11,825
Before going to the service,
l worked in a theme park.

500
00:49:11,908 --> 00:49:13,952
So this is my plan.

501
00:49:14,036 --> 00:49:18,582
At midnight, I値l be alone
with her in the park.

502
00:49:18,665 --> 00:49:21,960
It'll be completely dark
all around us.

503
00:49:22,002 --> 00:49:27,174
One by one, the lights
to the merry-go-round flick on.

504
00:49:27,257 --> 00:49:32,638
l raise my arms up there,
and her birthday song starts.

505
00:49:32,721 --> 00:49:36,058
Then all the lights turn on
and it moves.

506
00:49:36,141 --> 00:49:39,728
There's fireworks, too.
Isn稚 it fantastic?

507
00:49:39,812 --> 00:49:43,107
She'll be thrilled.

508
00:49:44,169 --> 00:49:48,382
l gave 200,000 won
to my friends working there.

509
00:49:48,757 --> 00:49:52,178
Jump over here?
Yeah. We have to.

510
00:49:52,344 --> 00:49:54,889
l always wanted to
come here at night.

511
00:49:56,057 --> 00:49:58,643
It痴 my birthday, not yours.

512
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:01,604
Please, let's just try.

513
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,357
I値l go up first
and help you.

514
00:50:15,243 --> 00:50:19,831
Eh? There's a step here.

515
00:50:19,956 --> 00:50:22,417
Take my hand.

516
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,878
Oh, shit!

517
00:50:27,005 --> 00:50:30,466
Shit!

518
00:50:31,301 --> 00:50:32,343
Gyeon-woo.

519
00:50:34,095 --> 00:50:34,804
Hey!

520
00:50:36,139 --> 00:50:41,770
Answer me.
I知 leaving. I知 leaving.

521
00:50:44,606 --> 00:50:49,569
Answer me!
You're dead.

522
00:50:49,653 --> 00:50:50,946
Wait till l catch you.

523
00:50:58,495 --> 00:51:02,916
Why didn't you answer?

524
00:51:02,958 --> 00:51:04,209
Wanna die?

525
00:51:12,342 --> 00:51:13,176
Come with me!

526
00:51:40,591 --> 00:51:41,425
Hurry and get in.

527
00:51:45,429 --> 00:51:46,222
Shut up!

528
00:51:49,016 --> 00:51:52,770
Go in fast. Move it.
Sit here.

529
00:51:52,853 --> 00:51:55,022
lf you're loud, I値l kill you.
Got it?

530
00:51:55,106 --> 00:51:55,982
Yes.

531
00:51:56,274 --> 00:51:59,026
Answer quietly!
Yes.

532
00:52:20,798 --> 00:52:22,133
Is that a real gun?

533
00:52:23,676 --> 00:52:26,596
Wanna see?
Forget it.

534
00:52:33,895 --> 00:52:34,980
How are you two related?

535
00:52:35,063 --> 00:52:40,193
We're just friends.

536
00:52:46,687 --> 00:52:47,855
Why are you here?

537
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:51,498
We just wanted to
come here at night.

538
00:52:51,571 --> 00:52:55,575
Tell me the truth, idiot.
Nothing special.

539
00:52:57,327 --> 00:52:58,745
Bullshit.

540
00:52:59,954 --> 00:53:01,790
What makes you
trust a guy like him?

541
00:53:05,335 --> 00:53:06,961
l trusted myself.

542
00:53:16,638 --> 00:53:18,098
l had a girlfriend, too.

543
00:53:20,684 --> 00:53:23,270
She visited me
every week for one year.

544
00:53:26,064 --> 00:53:27,691
l was so happy.

545
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:37,701
But that bitch fell in love
with the guard house sergeant.

546
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:45,459
l found out the fact
after he was discharged.

547
00:53:46,585 --> 00:53:48,670
Damn it.

548
00:53:49,963 --> 00:53:54,301
While I知 in the service,
even my dog...

549
00:53:55,135 --> 00:53:57,471
ran away with some mutt, too.

550
00:54:01,058 --> 00:54:05,604
My Yorkshire terrier.
Bitch.

551
00:54:07,273 --> 00:54:13,154
Fuck. l came out to
kill both bitches. Fuck.

552
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:18,242
l have the worst luck
in this world.

553
00:54:19,827 --> 00:54:21,913
Damn it.

554
00:54:25,183 --> 00:54:28,395
Know what special day
is it today?

555
00:54:28,687 --> 00:54:33,066
Huh, damn it?
This sucks!

556
00:54:37,446 --> 00:54:40,741
Uuuuuuuhhh~ ack!

557
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:51,539
Hey, what are the odds to meet
a runaway soldier in a park?

558
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:53,583
Don't know.

559
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:58,212
Heard your head blows up
if you shoot in the mouth.

560
00:54:58,296 --> 00:55:01,966
Yeah, the hole in your head
is this big.

561
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:05,345
That's serious.
A teeny bullet does that?

562
00:55:05,386 --> 00:55:07,472
Yeah, the bullet tears the...

563
00:55:07,555 --> 00:55:11,518
Hey! What are you two doing?

564
00:55:12,727 --> 00:55:14,437
Stop joking around.

565
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:19,651
Damn it. Damn it!

566
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:22,195
Even you bastards ignore me.

567
00:55:22,279 --> 00:55:28,452
That's why don't be foolish.
Why am l foolish?

568
00:55:28,535 --> 00:55:31,830
Even if you do this,
she won't come back.

569
00:55:32,622 --> 00:55:34,916
l know. l know, too.

570
00:55:35,667 --> 00:55:39,796
But if l die,
she'll be heartbroken.

571
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:42,174
She'll never be the same.

572
00:55:43,592 --> 00:55:44,801
You're wrong.

573
00:55:46,929 --> 00:55:50,808
The pain goes away
sooner than you think.

574
00:55:52,434 --> 00:55:53,936
You went through
something like this?

575
00:55:58,899 --> 00:56:04,530
Yeah. It happens that way.

576
00:56:06,115 --> 00:56:09,451
Damn it. lf I知 caught,
I値l go to the can.

577
00:56:09,994 --> 00:56:11,662
I値l always think of her there.

578
00:56:11,745 --> 00:56:13,330
What does 'can' mean?

579
00:56:13,414 --> 00:56:15,291
It means prison.

580
00:56:15,374 --> 00:56:17,043
Don't interrupt.
Sorry.

581
00:56:19,712 --> 00:56:24,258
Anyway, you're responsible
for your actions now.

582
00:56:26,155 --> 00:56:28,324
Excuse me, sir.

583
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,327
How about letting her go?

584
00:56:35,248 --> 00:56:36,332
lf l say no?

585
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:38,835
Then...

586
00:56:42,255 --> 00:56:44,757
... let me go,
instead.

587
00:56:48,344 --> 00:56:50,805
Come to think of it,

588
00:56:50,847 --> 00:56:53,433
your eyebrows remind
me of that sergeant.

589
00:56:53,516 --> 00:56:54,767
You act like him, too.

590
00:56:55,143 --> 00:56:57,270
You can go.

591
00:56:57,353 --> 00:56:58,813
And you...

592
00:57:00,315 --> 00:57:02,525
We die together.
Got it?

593
00:57:03,234 --> 00:57:04,069
Pardon?

594
00:57:04,819 --> 00:57:10,450
Hey, lady.
Forget about this bastard,
and look for a nice guy. Got it?

595
00:57:10,533 --> 00:57:12,535
Go!
Let's go together.

596
00:57:13,286 --> 00:57:14,412
All three of us.

597
00:57:17,123 --> 00:57:19,376
Will you leave if l kill him?

598
00:57:23,171 --> 00:57:27,467
Gyeon-woo.
Don't worry too much.

599
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:31,430
This soldier isn't a bad guy.

600
00:57:33,015 --> 00:57:34,391
You'll come out safely.

601
00:57:35,517 --> 00:57:38,520
You're leaving me alone?

602
00:57:39,396 --> 00:57:40,772
There's no other way.

603
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:50,157
l was afraid to die alone,
but I知 glad we're in it together.

604
00:58:08,342 --> 00:58:10,386
Oh, right.

605
00:58:10,428 --> 00:58:13,055
Over there,

606
00:58:13,139 --> 00:58:16,517
there's an exit near
the merry-go-round.

607
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,102
Nobody knows about it.

608
00:58:18,769 --> 00:58:21,480
l used to work here.

609
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:22,607
Really?

610
00:58:23,983 --> 00:58:25,234
You're not tricking me, right?

611
00:58:25,276 --> 00:58:27,487
I知 a man, too.
Why would l?

612
00:58:31,115 --> 00:58:32,408
Walk in front of me.

613
00:58:38,790 --> 00:58:40,458
See? l told you so.

614
00:58:52,303 --> 00:58:53,012
This way!

615
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:54,389
Shit!

616
00:59:08,195 --> 00:59:11,490
What's going on?
It痴 Gyeon-woo.

617
00:59:12,365 --> 00:59:15,452
Screw you!
Don't come closer!

618
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:19,081
I値l kill him!
I値l really kill him!

619
00:59:26,088 --> 00:59:30,509
Tell that bitch to come!
So she can see me die!

620
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:32,761
I値l give you an hour!

621
00:59:33,679 --> 00:59:38,308
lf not, I値l kill him,
and myself, too!

622
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:41,770
Got it?
Hurry up!

623
00:59:41,854 --> 00:59:43,605
Sniper 2!

624
00:59:43,689 --> 00:59:46,025
The hostage is in danger,
but we can still fire.

625
00:59:52,781 --> 00:59:56,202
Don't! Wait!
Don't shoot!

626
00:59:59,955 --> 01:00:02,249
Hey, soldier! l mean sir!

627
01:00:05,461 --> 01:00:07,254
Your girlfriend changed
her mind, right?

628
01:00:08,255 --> 01:00:10,007
Did you really love her?

629
01:00:12,385 --> 01:00:13,803
Ask yourself.

630
01:00:15,805 --> 01:00:17,473
l think you didn't.

631
01:00:19,642 --> 01:00:21,060
lf you really love her,

632
01:00:22,186 --> 01:00:26,274
you should let her go.

633
01:00:27,442 --> 01:00:29,319
lf not, then it's not love.

634
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:34,908
What's wrong with someone
you don't love getting married?

635
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:38,912
Stop this,

636
01:00:39,579 --> 01:00:41,664
and go back to
base as a real man.

637
01:00:45,043 --> 01:00:48,797
A person like you
should learn more about love.

638
01:00:51,967 --> 01:00:53,677
lf we want to learn,

639
01:00:55,929 --> 01:00:58,181
then we should keep living.

640
01:01:03,937 --> 01:01:07,190
Damn it.

641
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,235
She's the nicest girl I致e met.

642
01:01:11,653 --> 01:01:16,158
Hey! Don't let her go.
Got it?

643
01:01:18,619 --> 01:01:20,829
lf you do, I値l take her.

644
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:29,254
Can l go?
Go. Screw it.

645
01:01:31,382 --> 01:01:32,424
Shit! Don't know.

646
01:01:37,137 --> 01:01:38,847
Pop! Pop!

647
01:01:49,316 --> 01:01:53,404
Thank you.
Today's my birthday.

648
01:01:53,946 --> 01:01:56,449
I値l live on until
l learn what love is.

649
01:02:03,664 --> 01:02:07,376
What?
We're just friends?

650
01:02:09,086 --> 01:02:12,507
No, l said that to save you.

651
01:02:14,967 --> 01:02:17,345
Let me go, instead?

652
01:02:18,471 --> 01:02:20,098
Wanted to save yourself, huh?

653
01:02:20,848 --> 01:02:23,101
He wouldn't
have let you go.

654
01:02:23,184 --> 01:02:25,186
Stop lying!
Stop lying! Stop lying!

655
01:02:26,521 --> 01:02:29,023
Have a nice life alone.

656
01:02:31,025 --> 01:02:35,572
l screwed up her
birthday, but l feel good anyway.

657
01:02:35,739 --> 01:02:38,575
'Cause I知 proud
to be with her,

658
01:02:38,658 --> 01:02:40,952
and things turned
out as planned.

659
01:02:41,036 --> 01:02:43,538
l hope you believe in me.

660
01:02:44,539 --> 01:02:46,041
You can't?

661
01:02:46,333 --> 01:02:46,583
Wait...

662
01:02:49,878 --> 01:02:52,422
Second Half

663
01:03:22,317 --> 01:03:23,360
l remember.

664
01:03:24,361 --> 01:03:26,947
She always came
with him until last year.

665
01:03:30,117 --> 01:03:33,704
Was it last spring or winter?

666
01:03:34,663 --> 01:03:38,751
One day, she came alone
with flowers to ask a favour.

667
01:03:42,254 --> 01:03:46,842
To not let anyone
sit in his seat that day.

668
01:03:51,389 --> 01:03:52,265
What's up?

669
01:03:52,306 --> 01:03:54,475
Oh, hi.

670
01:03:55,184 --> 01:03:56,519
You're early.

671
01:03:57,144 --> 01:03:58,938
l was in the neighbourhood.

672
01:03:59,564 --> 01:04:00,731
Miss me?

673
01:04:01,315 --> 01:04:02,275
Of course!

674
01:04:03,818 --> 01:04:07,280
She always tried
hard to look cheery.

675
01:04:08,072 --> 01:04:11,326
l like her that way.
What would you like?

676
01:04:11,618 --> 01:04:12,452
Coke, please.

677
01:04:12,535 --> 01:04:14,662
Wanna die? Drink coffee.

678
01:04:15,371 --> 01:04:16,414
Two coffees, please.

679
01:04:16,497 --> 01:04:18,625
He he he~

680
01:04:18,708 --> 01:04:20,543
l know her.

681
01:04:20,627 --> 01:04:22,545
She pretends to be happy,

682
01:04:22,629 --> 01:04:25,965
but she's full of sorrow inside.

683
01:04:26,633 --> 01:04:29,511
What are you doing?
What are you smiling at?

684
01:04:29,594 --> 01:04:32,055
No. It痴 nothing.

685
01:04:34,975 --> 01:04:36,226
Looks fun, huh?

686
01:04:39,062 --> 01:04:41,773
Another one?
Why? Don't wanna read it?

687
01:04:41,815 --> 01:04:43,733
She may
get disappointed,

688
01:04:43,817 --> 01:04:47,654
but l should be
honest for her sake.

689
01:04:48,363 --> 01:04:51,283
Looks fun. I値l read it.

690
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:52,868
Ha ha ha~

691
01:05:01,346 --> 01:05:04,016
This time it's
a martial arts film.

692
01:05:09,521 --> 01:05:12,733
The heroine is a bounty hunter.

693
01:05:16,362 --> 01:05:20,074
The villain wears rain
slippers even on clear days.

694
01:05:20,699 --> 01:05:23,369
The worst of his kind.

695
01:05:31,001 --> 01:05:32,712
What happened?
His name's Gyeon-woo?

696
01:05:32,795 --> 01:05:34,588
Gyeon-woo?

697
01:05:34,672 --> 01:05:36,924
The story's
setting is a mess.

698
01:05:37,008 --> 01:05:39,885
Japan invades during
King Sejong's reign,

699
01:05:39,927 --> 01:05:43,014
and the king's father
is the tyrant Yeonsan.

700
01:05:46,809 --> 01:05:50,396
In the end, the heroine
fights the villain in a field.

701
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:53,524
Heavy rain pours
down on a sunny day.

702
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:02,742
He he he~

703
01:06:17,298 --> 01:06:20,260
Yaaaah~

704
01:06:21,678 --> 01:06:23,680
Yup~!

705
01:06:55,838 --> 01:07:00,217
The heroine becomes a king.
King Jung-jo.

706
01:07:00,801 --> 01:07:02,636
She's from the future, of course.

707
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,471
It痴 fun, huh?

708
01:07:04,888 --> 01:07:08,684
Why is the heroine
always from the future?

709
01:07:08,976 --> 01:07:12,146
Science is advanced then,

710
01:07:12,354 --> 01:07:14,064
so they invent a time machine.

711
01:07:15,816 --> 01:07:18,819
And people go to
the past to travel.

712
01:07:20,029 --> 01:07:23,491
People from the future
could be here now.

713
01:07:23,699 --> 01:07:28,079
l think UFOs
are time machines.

714
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:32,542
Someday, I値l meet
someone from the future.

715
01:07:33,709 --> 01:07:34,710
l have to.

716
01:07:35,711 --> 01:07:39,465
lf you do,
ask him to take you.

717
01:07:40,174 --> 01:07:40,925
What?

718
01:07:41,509 --> 01:07:42,510
lf it's possible...

719
01:07:43,219 --> 01:07:45,471
Give this to Shin Cine.

720
01:07:46,097 --> 01:07:50,310
Tell them to cast
Han Suk-gyu and Shim Eun-ha.

721
01:07:50,393 --> 01:07:52,020
Jeon Do-yun is okay, too.

722
01:07:52,123 --> 01:07:56,002
Excuse me,
we talked on the phone, right?

723
01:07:56,961 --> 01:07:59,547
Well... this is
'The Warrior's Sad Love Story'...

724
01:08:27,676 --> 01:08:31,096
On the way, we
play fun games, too.

725
01:08:33,265 --> 01:08:36,434
Left foot over the line, l win.

726
01:08:36,518 --> 01:08:40,272
With the right foot, you win.

727
01:08:40,355 --> 01:08:41,314
What's the prize?

728
01:08:43,608 --> 01:08:44,317
Let's see...

729
01:08:46,987 --> 01:08:47,988
How about a kiss?

730
01:08:48,030 --> 01:08:49,364
A kiss?

731
01:08:50,365 --> 01:08:51,491
Wanna die?

732
01:08:52,701 --> 01:08:53,535
You choose.

733
01:08:55,662 --> 01:08:56,622
Hitting each other.

734
01:08:57,706 --> 01:08:58,832
Again?

735
01:08:59,625 --> 01:09:01,043
You can hit me, too.

736
01:09:02,461 --> 01:09:03,420
Okay.

737
01:09:05,214 --> 01:09:05,881
Someone's coming.

738
01:09:24,358 --> 01:09:26,235
Ha ha ha~~~~~!

739
01:09:31,032 --> 01:09:32,992
l think this is unfair.

740
01:09:33,993 --> 01:09:36,412
I知 a girl, so I値l
slap the cheek.

741
01:09:37,246 --> 01:09:39,832
No. Then I値l change it, too.

742
01:09:40,666 --> 01:09:44,170
But I知 a girl.
Men and women are equal.

743
01:09:46,255 --> 01:09:50,426
Okay, then.
You slap, and l slap, too.

744
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:53,429
Go easy on me,
and I値l kill you.

745
01:09:53,471 --> 01:09:55,139
Better slap me on the cheek.

746
01:09:55,223 --> 01:09:57,433
lf you don't, I値l kill you!

747
01:10:00,436 --> 01:10:01,396
All right.

748
01:10:02,063 --> 01:10:04,566
You slap, and I値l use my finger.

749
01:10:04,607 --> 01:10:06,901
Right, that's fair.

750
01:10:07,777 --> 01:10:09,112
Saw that?

751
01:10:09,195 --> 01:10:12,532
See that guy step over
with his left foot?

752
01:10:12,605 --> 01:10:15,358
l had my eyes closed.
Plus he came the opposite way.

753
01:10:15,442 --> 01:10:16,776
l thought it was this way.

754
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:18,778
Shut up. Here they come.

755
01:10:22,115 --> 01:10:24,242
Left foot. Left foot.

756
01:10:31,458 --> 01:10:32,751
It値l be the right foot.

757
01:10:32,834 --> 01:10:37,923
Left! Left!
Switch to the right.

758
01:10:45,973 --> 01:10:49,059
You have to hit me?

759
01:10:49,235 --> 01:10:53,657
Come here. Stay still.
Ugh! Uh uh uh~!

760
01:11:02,322 --> 01:11:03,532
When I知 with her,

761
01:11:03,605 --> 01:11:06,441
l never know how
the day will turn out.

762
01:11:30,257 --> 01:11:30,966
What?

763
01:11:31,050 --> 01:11:32,593
What are you looking at?

764
01:11:57,493 --> 01:11:59,370
l quit!

765
01:11:59,996 --> 01:12:01,706
Is your face a racket?

766
01:12:05,710 --> 01:12:09,172
Why does the ball
always hit my face?

767
01:12:10,423 --> 01:12:11,799
It痴 strange.

768
01:12:13,509 --> 01:12:15,053
Ugh~!

769
01:12:32,487 --> 01:12:35,782
l never want to lose a game.

770
01:12:36,741 --> 01:12:39,744
So l play until l win.

771
01:13:05,228 --> 01:13:08,190
Aaaaaaaaah~!

772
01:13:11,652 --> 01:13:13,195
Ugh!

773
01:13:33,424 --> 01:13:34,758
Wait long?

774
01:13:34,925 --> 01:13:36,594
Just a teeny bit.

775
01:14:04,247 --> 01:14:07,250
My mom bought me these heels,

776
01:14:07,792 --> 01:14:11,129
but they're killing my feet.

777
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:13,798
Want a massage?

778
01:14:13,881 --> 01:14:15,842
No, it's okay.

779
01:14:15,925 --> 01:14:17,802
Instead, let's exchange shoes.

780
01:14:21,181 --> 01:14:22,348
Don't wanna?

781
01:14:23,308 --> 01:14:25,727
How can a guy wear heels?

782
01:14:25,810 --> 01:14:27,645
It値l fit.

783
01:14:29,898 --> 01:14:31,441
But, l can't...

784
01:14:32,984 --> 01:14:36,613
Yeah? l see.

785
01:14:37,197 --> 01:14:44,079
Come on. I値l buy you some sneakers.

786
01:14:44,162 --> 01:14:45,622
Forget it.

787
01:14:47,124 --> 01:14:51,378
Then wear mine,
and I値l carry yours.

788
01:14:51,461 --> 01:14:52,921
You don't understand women.

789
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:57,301
Okay! Let's exchange.

790
01:14:59,636 --> 01:15:00,554
Really?

791
01:15:15,444 --> 01:15:18,197
Wanna know a secret?

792
01:15:19,448 --> 01:15:20,324
What is it?

793
01:15:20,366 --> 01:15:24,286
l don't wear panties on exam day.

794
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:27,706
But l had one today.

795
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:30,960
Catch me, honey!

796
01:15:37,550 --> 01:15:40,553
Hey. lf you don't, I値l kill you.

797
01:15:41,429 --> 01:15:45,516
Phew~
Catch me, honey~!

798
01:15:47,059 --> 01:15:47,977
Stop right there!

799
01:15:50,062 --> 01:15:50,855
Stop!

800
01:16:23,555 --> 01:16:24,347
Out!

801
01:17:09,601 --> 01:17:15,316
It was just a second, but l
felt something in her eyes.

802
01:17:20,321 --> 01:17:21,947
That's my house.

803
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:29,705
Wait. I値l bring you an umbrella.

804
01:17:30,331 --> 01:17:34,502
I知 okay. I知 already
wet so I値l just leave.

805
01:18:12,207 --> 01:18:16,336
Are you my daughter's boyfriend?

806
01:18:19,214 --> 01:18:20,006
Yes, sir.

807
01:18:20,090 --> 01:18:22,842
How much do you know
about my daughter?

808
01:18:27,430 --> 01:18:29,182
Not much...

809
01:18:37,733 --> 01:18:41,028
Next time, don't hang out till late.

810
01:18:48,535 --> 01:18:50,871
You don't understand me.

811
01:18:50,913 --> 01:18:53,207
Why'd you stand him up?

812
01:18:53,248 --> 01:18:56,543
What's wrong with him?
Why do you stand guys up?

813
01:18:56,627 --> 01:18:59,380
And what happened to your heels?

814
01:18:59,421 --> 01:19:01,382
What's wrong with you?

815
01:19:01,423 --> 01:19:04,218
l told you not to meet Gyeon-woo.

816
01:19:04,301 --> 01:19:07,555
He's dumb and has no future.

817
01:19:07,638 --> 01:19:09,265
It痴 none of your business.

818
01:19:09,348 --> 01:19:10,891
Why is he stupid?

819
01:19:10,975 --> 01:19:14,061
You're stupid so you don't know.

820
01:19:14,145 --> 01:19:16,105
What has gotten in to you?

821
01:19:16,147 --> 01:19:18,107
Let me live my own life!

822
01:19:35,208 --> 01:19:36,542
Afterwards,

823
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:39,796
l didn't hear
from her for a long time.

824
01:19:43,508 --> 01:19:45,677
Hello?
Gyeon-woo, it's me.

825
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:46,719
Long time no see.

826
01:19:46,803 --> 01:19:49,389
Her voice sounds cheerful
as if nothing happened to her.

827
01:19:49,472 --> 01:19:52,767
Our 100th day celebration
is soon.

828
01:19:52,809 --> 01:19:54,686
It痴 100 days already?

829
01:19:54,769 --> 01:19:57,397
When do you think
a girl's the prettiest?

830
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:02,444
When a sexy woman is naked.

831
01:20:02,527 --> 01:20:05,322
Where are you now?
Stay right there.

832
01:20:05,405 --> 01:20:09,200
No, I知 just kidding.

833
01:20:10,076 --> 01:20:12,996
The prettiest is when she's
playing the piano.

834
01:20:13,705 --> 01:20:15,207
What's your favorite song?

835
01:20:15,290 --> 01:20:18,168
That George Winston song.

836
01:20:22,547 --> 01:20:23,757
Pachelbel Canon?

837
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:25,801
Yeah, that song.

838
01:20:25,884 --> 01:20:27,594
You're not gonna ask me?

839
01:20:27,878 --> 01:20:31,882
When is the guy the prettiest?

840
01:20:31,965 --> 01:20:34,176
Just give me a rose.

841
01:20:34,259 --> 01:20:36,386
Still have your high school uniform?

842
01:20:36,470 --> 01:20:38,889
Yeah. Why?

843
01:20:38,972 --> 01:20:41,725
Bring it on our 100th day,

844
01:20:41,808 --> 01:20:44,436
and give me a rose
during my class.

845
01:20:44,519 --> 01:20:46,146
Do it yourself, okay?

846
01:20:46,229 --> 01:20:50,150
What? What did you say?
How can l during class?

847
01:20:50,776 --> 01:20:54,404
Hey! Just hung up on me!
Damn it!

848
01:20:58,534 --> 01:21:00,703
l don't wanna get beaten by her,

849
01:21:01,578 --> 01:21:04,164
or get humiliated
at a women's college.

850
01:21:06,483 --> 01:21:08,860
I知 cleverer than l look.

851
01:21:08,902 --> 01:21:10,904
These girls sure
love Chinese food.

852
01:21:10,987 --> 01:21:14,700
Hey, you! Where you headed?
Come here!

853
01:21:14,783 --> 01:21:16,868
I知 delivering Chinese food.

854
01:21:17,661 --> 01:21:19,329
l ordered it. Bring it here.

855
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:21,206
Really?

856
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:23,083
Bring a lot of radish?

857
01:21:25,419 --> 01:21:26,962
Oh, l forgot something!

858
01:21:27,045 --> 01:21:30,174
Give me the food first!
That's the wrong way!

859
01:21:30,883 --> 01:21:32,092
There's another customer.

860
01:21:32,176 --> 01:21:33,052
Hey!

861
01:24:26,186 --> 01:24:28,021
But that wasn't enough for her.

862
01:24:31,608 --> 01:24:34,694
We relived our old
high school days.

863
01:25:26,417 --> 01:25:32,131
After we visited that club, a school
uniform party was held every month.

864
01:25:34,383 --> 01:25:35,885
But she got wasted again.

865
01:25:38,513 --> 01:25:39,889
Oh, wild teens!
Here's a condom.

866
01:25:39,972 --> 01:25:41,766
Let's prevent AIDS.

867
01:25:46,354 --> 01:25:47,021
Taxi!

868
01:26:00,201 --> 01:26:03,246
She's having a happy dream.

869
01:26:04,205 --> 01:26:08,793
Compared to when l looked at her
in the motel the first time,

870
01:26:08,877 --> 01:26:10,754
She looks so different.

871
01:26:11,421 --> 01:26:14,591
Could her pain be cured now?

872
01:26:15,634 --> 01:26:21,598
Maybe it means that she doesn't
need me anymore.

873
01:26:23,767 --> 01:26:31,441
Excuse me. Can you drive slowly?

874
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:41,535
Here.

875
01:27:08,062 --> 01:27:09,897
Have any plans after graduation?

876
01:27:10,439 --> 01:27:14,068
Actually, I致e never
thought about it yet.

877
01:27:15,152 --> 01:27:17,822
Can l see what's in your pocket?

878
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:21,367
Sir? Right.

879
01:27:52,222 --> 01:27:54,432
What is this for?

880
01:27:55,225 --> 01:28:01,815
Oh, right. l learned that
it prevents AIDS.

881
01:28:02,565 --> 01:28:04,693
But l haven't used it yet.

882
01:28:06,236 --> 01:28:08,947
Actually, on the way here.
Forget it.

883
01:28:14,494 --> 01:28:18,957
'Chicks Hen'?
What does this mean?

884
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:26,590
Oh, right.
It痴 a chicken soup restaurant.

885
01:28:28,842 --> 01:28:32,095
'We'll satisfy all your wishes?'

886
01:28:33,180 --> 01:28:37,100
l think it's to
satisfy our tastes.

887
01:28:56,851 --> 01:28:58,519
How do feel about our daughter?

888
01:29:01,981 --> 01:29:07,069
Oh, right. We're just friends now.

889
01:29:07,528 --> 01:29:08,821
Please don't worry.

890
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:13,659
lf we get closer,
I値l let you know, sir.

891
01:29:14,493 --> 01:29:16,370
Don't see her any more.

892
01:29:20,301 --> 01:29:23,221
After that day, she never calls me.

893
01:29:24,889 --> 01:29:29,852
It was sudden,
but that's how we broke up.

894
01:29:33,272 --> 01:29:39,279
We're broken up.
Now, I知 free.

895
01:29:57,589 --> 01:30:00,800
It痴 me. Come to the cafe
by seven o'clock.

896
01:30:01,927 --> 01:30:02,594
Why?

897
01:30:03,428 --> 01:30:06,848
What? l have a blind date today.

898
01:30:07,724 --> 01:30:08,683
Come in 45 minutes.

899
01:30:09,935 --> 01:30:11,228
l have a blind date, too.

900
01:30:25,784 --> 01:30:26,910
Are you on your way?

901
01:30:27,411 --> 01:30:29,246
I知 on a date with a girl.

902
01:30:29,288 --> 01:30:30,164
Hurry up.

903
01:30:40,257 --> 01:30:43,594
l have to go to the bathroom.

904
01:30:47,848 --> 01:30:50,142
'Gotta go to the bathroom.'

905
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:06,345
Eh?

906
01:31:28,838 --> 01:31:29,672
Nice to meet you.

907
01:31:30,475 --> 01:31:32,227
I知 Cha Seok-won.
Nice to meet you.

908
01:31:32,310 --> 01:31:34,562
Same here.
Have a seat.

909
01:31:43,363 --> 01:31:45,824
Were you really with a girl?

910
01:31:48,618 --> 01:31:51,371
No, l was with a guy.

911
01:31:54,791 --> 01:31:55,500
Can l take your order?

912
01:31:56,877 --> 01:31:57,711
Coffee, please.

913
01:31:59,004 --> 01:32:00,380
You can drink coke.

914
01:32:02,674 --> 01:32:03,508
I値l drink coffee.

915
01:32:07,346 --> 01:32:10,182
Gyeon-woo. You're very lucky.

916
01:32:11,109 --> 01:32:15,113
l heard a lot about you.
That you're close friend.

917
01:32:18,742 --> 01:32:19,243
Friend...

918
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:25,921
l need to go
to the bathroom.

919
01:32:39,812 --> 01:32:40,563
Where's Gyeon-woo?

920
01:32:41,814 --> 01:32:42,732
He left already.

921
01:32:44,484 --> 01:32:47,445
He told me ten rules to follow.

922
01:32:48,696 --> 01:32:51,074
l have a good memory.
I値l recite them.

923
01:32:53,159 --> 01:32:59,666
First, don't ask her to be feminine.
And don't...

924
01:32:59,749 --> 01:33:03,336
Second, don't let her drink
over three glasses.

925
01:33:03,753 --> 01:33:05,296
She'll beat someone.

926
01:33:06,506 --> 01:33:11,386
At a cafe, drink coffee
instead of coke or juice.

927
01:33:12,637 --> 01:33:16,391
lf she hits you,
act like it hurts.

928
01:33:17,017 --> 01:33:19,185
lf it hurts, act like it doesn't.

929
01:33:21,146 --> 01:33:25,108
On your 100th day together,

930
01:33:25,859 --> 01:33:27,819
give her a rose
during her class.

931
01:33:28,820 --> 01:33:29,988
She'll like it a lot.

932
01:33:31,072 --> 01:33:32,741
Make sure you learn
fencing and squash.

933
01:33:34,576 --> 01:33:37,412
Also, be prepared to
go to prison sometimes.

934
01:33:38,538 --> 01:33:39,915
lf she says she'll kill you,

935
01:33:41,166 --> 01:33:44,253
don't take it lightly.
You'll feel better.

936
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:49,091
lf her feet hurts,
exchange shoes with her.

937
01:33:49,967 --> 01:33:55,139
Finally, she likes to write.

938
01:33:56,724 --> 01:33:58,100
Encourage her.

939
01:35:18,807 --> 01:35:24,813
Ladies and gentlemen,
please pay attention to here...

940
01:35:24,896 --> 01:35:25,939
Gyeon-woo.

941
01:35:28,984 --> 01:35:33,155
Step backward on the yellow line...

942
01:35:33,238 --> 01:35:33,905
Gyeon-woo!

943
01:35:37,367 --> 01:35:44,124
... after passenger's
getting off, take in order...

944
01:35:44,208 --> 01:35:44,750
Gyeon-woo!

945
01:35:49,004 --> 01:35:53,676
...please use the next train.

946
01:35:57,179 --> 01:35:58,430
What's his name?

947
01:35:58,514 --> 01:36:00,808
Gyeon-woo. I値l do it myself.

948
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:12,236
Gyeon-woo. Where are you?
l looked all over for you.

949
01:36:16,198 --> 01:36:20,953
Gyeon-woo.
Come to the escalator. Okay?

950
01:36:21,621 --> 01:36:23,998
You're dead if you don't.
Hurry up.

951
01:36:46,866 --> 01:36:48,034
Who told you to hug me?

952
01:36:57,513 --> 01:37:00,016
Dummy. You're supposed to dodge.

953
01:37:04,854 --> 01:37:09,734
Sometimes l feel like l know her
and sometimes l don't.

954
01:37:10,652 --> 01:37:14,197
We're definitely standing
at the crossroad now.

955
01:37:15,448 --> 01:37:17,075
What's going on between us?

956
01:37:18,285 --> 01:37:21,788
Can this relationship
last forever?

957
01:37:43,352 --> 01:37:44,144
Who is it?

958
01:37:47,356 --> 01:37:48,524
It痴 me, Dad.

959
01:38:10,045 --> 01:38:13,382
She told me to write a letter
and bring it.

960
01:38:14,175 --> 01:38:15,968
To write it on paper.

961
01:38:17,595 --> 01:38:19,972
To express my feelings,

962
01:38:20,473 --> 01:38:22,391
l tried hard to find
the right words.

963
01:38:24,769 --> 01:38:26,270
When l first met her,

964
01:38:26,938 --> 01:38:30,399
l wanted to cure her grief,

965
01:38:31,192 --> 01:38:33,569
but now l can't give her up.

966
01:38:34,529 --> 01:38:38,157
l wish we can get serious.

967
01:38:39,075 --> 01:38:41,995
I知 writing about
these feelings.

968
01:38:42,954 --> 01:38:45,999
She's probably
writing about me now.

969
01:38:47,876 --> 01:38:52,297
This is how we're
preparing to split up.

970
01:39:12,734 --> 01:39:13,527
Gyeon-woo.

971
01:39:15,403 --> 01:39:17,239
See that mountain top?

972
01:39:18,740 --> 01:39:19,366
Yeah.

973
01:39:21,076 --> 01:39:23,745
Could someone
hear me from there?

974
01:39:25,455 --> 01:39:31,545
Yes, probably so.
Or probably not.

975
01:39:33,255 --> 01:39:36,341
Then go over there.
I値l shout here.

976
01:39:36,633 --> 01:39:38,093
lf you hear, answer me.

977
01:39:40,304 --> 01:39:42,055
You want me to go over there?

978
01:39:43,932 --> 01:39:44,725
Yeah.

979
01:39:58,405 --> 01:39:59,615
Gyeon-woo?

980
01:40:01,117 --> 01:40:02,201
Can you hear me?

981
01:40:04,912 --> 01:40:15,798
Gyeon-woo! I知 sorry.
l really can't help it.

982
01:40:18,342 --> 01:40:29,395
Gyeon-woo. I知 sorry.
I知 sorry... l can't help it.

983
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:37,018
l thought l was different,
but I知 just a helpless girl.

984
01:40:40,762 --> 01:40:53,900
Gyeon-woo! I知 sorry.

985
01:41:09,666 --> 01:41:10,834
Did you bring your letter?

986
01:41:11,835 --> 01:41:12,419
Yeah.

987
01:41:16,590 --> 01:41:18,467
What's that?

988
01:41:19,801 --> 01:41:20,928
A time capsule.

989
01:41:23,722 --> 01:41:27,434
We put our letters
in it and bury it here.

990
01:41:29,645 --> 01:41:34,233
And two years later,
let's meet here again.

991
01:41:35,182 --> 01:41:39,019
We'll read the letters that day,

992
01:41:40,354 --> 01:41:42,523
and maybe we can
find an answer then.

993
01:41:44,128 --> 01:41:46,630
This was her way of saying good-bye,

994
01:41:47,266 --> 01:41:53,522
and l kept repeating in my mind
that two years isn't long.

995
01:42:13,084 --> 01:42:21,509
Let's open this exactly
two years later, at two, Okay?

996
01:42:58,797 --> 01:43:02,092
We can meet two years later.

997
01:43:02,968 --> 01:43:08,098
When we meet then, we'll be
different from what we are now.

998
01:43:09,057 --> 01:43:12,102
We may become closer,

999
01:43:12,978 --> 01:43:14,771
or stay forever apart.

1000
01:43:15,147 --> 01:43:18,066
We can only choose one.

1001
01:43:41,445 --> 01:43:44,198
Gyeon-woo. You go first.

1002
01:43:44,401 --> 01:43:45,694
Let's separate here.

1003
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:03,025
See you two years later!

1004
01:44:03,140 --> 01:44:04,517
Okay, in two years!

1005
01:44:04,642 --> 01:44:05,518
Two years!

1006
01:44:08,563 --> 01:44:09,355
Bye!

1007
01:44:43,014 --> 01:44:45,058
Gyeon-woo!

1008
01:44:58,429 --> 01:45:01,557
That's how we broke up.

1009
01:45:06,270 --> 01:45:09,231
Overtime

1010
01:45:10,512 --> 01:45:14,975
l couldn't endure the loneliness
after we broke up.

1011
01:45:16,185 --> 01:45:17,603
Thinking of those memories,

1012
01:45:18,354 --> 01:45:22,233
l started to write about
our stories on the Internet.

1013
01:45:23,756 --> 01:45:25,591
Then l made up my mind.

1014
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:30,773
lf l meet her again,
I値l show her a different myself.

1015
01:45:31,764 --> 01:45:37,228
Got to make use of my time.
For her and my future's sake.

1016
01:45:44,642 --> 01:45:48,813
Why does the ball l hit keep
hitting my face?

1017
01:46:14,869 --> 01:46:19,457
l wrote our stories on the
Internet everyday,

1018
01:46:20,584 --> 01:46:24,171
and l kept myself
busy for two years.

1019
01:46:41,470 --> 01:46:49,311
Excuse me. l wrote 'My Sassy Girl'.

1020
01:46:49,770 --> 01:46:53,315
Shin Cine saw my writing,

1021
01:46:53,732 --> 01:46:56,860
and offered to make
a movie out of it.

1022
01:46:57,778 --> 01:47:00,864
l made her dream
come true instead.

1023
01:47:01,647 --> 01:47:05,109
l wanted to tell her
right away,

1024
01:47:05,526 --> 01:47:07,945
but l can only wait
till that day.

1025
01:47:10,434 --> 01:47:12,018
She didn't come.

1026
01:47:13,103 --> 01:47:15,564
It痴 our only day to meet.

1027
01:47:16,835 --> 01:47:19,338
No one knows
when she will come.

1028
01:48:12,305 --> 01:48:14,056
How did he get in here?

1029
01:48:14,849 --> 01:48:15,975
It痴 a mystery.

1030
01:48:32,784 --> 01:48:35,703
Gyeon-woo! How are you?

1031
01:48:37,163 --> 01:48:40,708
l was so happy
while being with you.

1032
01:48:41,668 --> 01:48:47,799
I知 not sure if you knew,
but the person l loved passed away.

1033
01:48:49,467 --> 01:48:51,177
The day when l first met you

1034
01:48:51,678 --> 01:48:55,348
was the day he died
a year ago.

1035
01:48:57,350 --> 01:49:02,355
Actually, l tried to
look for him in you.

1036
01:49:03,752 --> 01:49:07,464
l know it was wrong.
I知 sorry.

1037
01:49:14,399 --> 01:49:18,570
l also met him on
the subway like you.

1038
01:49:20,739 --> 01:49:23,158
l was really sick at that time.

1039
01:49:26,265 --> 01:49:34,815
He did everything l wanted.
Like you did to me.

1040
01:49:42,219 --> 01:49:45,556
Under this tree, we planned
our future together.

1041
01:49:47,628 --> 01:49:51,090
But he suddenly passed away.

1042
01:49:52,425 --> 01:49:57,597
While l was dating you,
l met his mother often.

1043
01:49:59,932 --> 01:50:02,685
She wanted to introduce
a nice man to me,

1044
01:50:03,645 --> 01:50:04,979
but l couldn't.

1045
01:50:09,067 --> 01:50:13,404
The day l first met you,
l came under this tree,

1046
01:50:14,614 --> 01:50:16,407
and l prayed to him.

1047
01:50:17,283 --> 01:50:18,993
To let me free.

1048
01:50:21,121 --> 01:50:24,624
When l met you,
this occurred to me.

1049
01:50:25,428 --> 01:50:29,015
That maybe...
he introduced you to me.

1050
01:50:30,100 --> 01:50:32,018
But the more l met you,

1051
01:50:33,174 --> 01:50:37,137
he seemed to grow
jealous of you in me.

1052
01:50:38,180 --> 01:50:44,895
The more l liked you,
l felt guilty inside.

1053
01:50:46,271 --> 01:50:49,399
While the two of us are apart,

1054
01:50:49,983 --> 01:50:52,402
l want to forget him alone.

1055
01:50:57,241 --> 01:51:01,703
After that day, l went often to
this place.

1056
01:51:03,747 --> 01:51:07,418
lf I知 not with you
after two years,

1057
01:51:08,001 --> 01:51:09,586
it means l still lack of courage.

1058
01:51:11,005 --> 01:51:14,425
How much will we change
after two years?

1059
01:51:16,919 --> 01:51:18,962
l feel like you live
in the future,

1060
01:51:19,755 --> 01:51:21,757
and l stay in the past.

1061
01:51:24,301 --> 01:51:25,511
l want to meet you soon,

1062
01:51:26,595 --> 01:51:28,222
so l can read your letter.

1063
01:52:16,813 --> 01:52:18,857
Why are you staring at me, sir?

1064
01:52:18,940 --> 01:52:25,864
Because you're so pretty.
l thought an angel came down.

1065
01:52:30,493 --> 01:52:32,162
Do you come here often?

1066
01:52:32,746 --> 01:52:37,751
Sometimes. This tree has a secret.

1067
01:52:39,878 --> 01:52:42,047
l have a secret here, too.

1068
01:52:42,923 --> 01:52:43,799
Really?

1069
01:52:46,468 --> 01:52:52,099
Three years ago, l buried a letter
here with my boyfriend.

1070
01:52:54,977 --> 01:52:56,561
What's your secret?

1071
01:52:56,895 --> 01:52:57,854
So what happened?

1072
01:53:00,148 --> 01:53:04,278
We promised to read
the letters a year ago.

1073
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:08,699
But l couldn't come.

1074
01:53:10,284 --> 01:53:11,910
l guess you're a year late.

1075
01:53:15,164 --> 01:53:17,708
But two years didn't seem that long.

1076
01:53:20,711 --> 01:53:22,796
l haven't made any decision yet.

1077
01:53:26,008 --> 01:53:28,344
l just wasted my time
on stupid thoughts.

1078
01:53:29,386 --> 01:53:30,638
Like what?

1079
01:53:35,017 --> 01:53:36,852
lf we were destined to meet,

1080
01:53:38,980 --> 01:53:41,232
l thought we'd meet
by chance somewhere.

1081
01:53:43,484 --> 01:53:45,152
Know what fate is?

1082
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:52,076
Building a bridge of chance
for someone you love.

1083
01:53:57,874 --> 01:54:03,963
To be honest,
l read you guys letters.

1084
01:54:07,091 --> 01:54:09,511
l said this tree
had a secret, right?

1085
01:54:09,886 --> 01:54:10,512
Yes.

1086
01:54:12,472 --> 01:54:19,312
Look closely. Does this tree
look the same as before?

1087
01:54:30,198 --> 01:54:35,245
Well, it looks like it
changed a bit. But I知 not sure.

1088
01:54:37,289 --> 01:54:40,333
People are dead or alive.

1089
01:54:41,376 --> 01:54:45,172
There's a dead tree
and a living tree, too.

1090
01:54:47,299 --> 01:54:51,261
This tree was struck dead
by lightning last year.

1091
01:54:52,638 --> 01:54:54,264
It was split into two.

1092
01:54:57,726 --> 01:55:01,814
But this young man felt sorry for it.

1093
01:55:03,482 --> 01:55:05,526
During this spring,

1094
01:55:06,402 --> 01:55:12,700
he planted another tree
that looked the same.

1095
01:55:15,244 --> 01:55:17,746
When he planted the tree,

1096
01:55:18,289 --> 01:55:24,086
he asked me if it look the same.

1097
01:55:25,796 --> 01:55:29,842
He said that someone
would be sad if it died,

1098
01:55:31,594 --> 01:55:34,931
so no one should know.

1099
01:55:37,808 --> 01:55:38,518
Gyeon-woo...

1100
01:56:11,527 --> 01:56:15,489
You call a wrong number
or the dial is not in service.

1101
01:56:17,614 --> 01:56:18,824
Please, call again.

1102
01:57:58,366 --> 01:57:58,908
Hi.

1103
01:58:05,456 --> 01:58:09,627
It痴 been a while.
You've gotten prettier.

1104
01:58:10,295 --> 01:58:13,006
You still look young.
How have you been?

1105
01:58:13,653 --> 01:58:14,904
You were in England?

1106
01:58:15,280 --> 01:58:18,199
Yes. For one and a half years.

1107
01:58:22,787 --> 01:58:26,124
So l can forget him.

1108
01:58:31,421 --> 01:58:35,175
l see. Feel better?

1109
01:58:35,300 --> 01:58:37,678
Yes. A lot better.

1110
01:58:38,230 --> 01:58:39,731
Is it true now?

1111
01:58:40,440 --> 01:58:42,693
My son might be sad.

1112
01:58:43,235 --> 01:58:46,864
He won't.
He'll like it this way.

1113
01:58:50,586 --> 01:58:55,215
Good,
that's what l really hoped.

1114
01:58:55,320 --> 01:58:57,948
Auntie! l was getting
my photo taken.

1115
01:58:58,073 --> 01:59:02,161
You naughty boy.

1116
01:59:03,245 --> 01:59:04,997
Know how long it's been?

1117
01:59:05,789 --> 01:59:07,625
Sorry l didn't tell you before.

1118
01:59:07,750 --> 01:59:11,337
This is Gyeon-woo.
Doesn't he resemble him?

1119
01:59:12,014 --> 01:59:13,557
When you had a hard time,

1120
01:59:13,974 --> 01:59:18,145
l tried to introduce you
to him for several years,

1121
01:59:18,511 --> 01:59:20,554
but he kept getting out of it.

1122
01:59:22,088 --> 01:59:23,631
Heard you came to Bupyung often,

1123
01:59:24,757 --> 01:59:26,884
but you never visited me?

1124
01:59:33,796 --> 01:59:34,922
Go out with him.

1125
01:59:36,132 --> 01:59:40,303
l thought he'd make
things easy for you.

1126
01:59:42,055 --> 01:59:45,767
Oh, yeah. Gyeon-woo,
you're going to England, right?

1127
01:59:46,726 --> 01:59:51,439
She's already been there,
so she can give you some tips.

1128
01:59:53,608 --> 01:59:57,403
l don't have to go now.

1129
01:59:58,988 --> 02:00:06,538
Why? You two know each other?

1130
02:00:10,083 --> 02:00:15,297
You may not believe it, but l think l
met a man from the future.

1131
02:00:17,007 --> 02:00:18,466
From your future.

1132
02:00:24,347 --> 02:00:27,017
This is how l met her again.

1133
02:00:27,768 --> 02:00:29,353
Think it's too coincidental?

1134
02:00:30,020 --> 02:00:34,983
It痴 building a bridge
of chance for your love.

1135
02:00:39,080 --> 02:00:43,080
