1
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:57,330


2
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,120
In the year of our Lord...

3
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:04,230
...Judea, for nearly a century, had lain under the mastery of Rome.

4
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,060
In the seventh year of the reign of Augustus Caesar...

5
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,760
...an imperial decree ordered every Judean...

6
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,460
...each to return to his place of birth...

7
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,970
...to be counted and taxed.

8
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,870
Converging ways of many of them led to their capital city, Jerusalem...

9
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,110
...the troubled heart of their land.

10
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,890
The old city was dominated by the fortress of Antonia...

11
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,490
...the seat of Roman power...

12
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,780
...and by the great golden temple...

13
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:35,220
...the outward sign of an inward and imperishable faith.

14
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,150
Even while they obeyed the will of Caesar...

15
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,490
...the people clung proudly to their ancient heritage...

16
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,760
...always remembering the promise of their prophets...

17
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:49,270
...that one day there would be born among them a redeemer...

18
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,070
...to bring them salvation and perfect freedom.

19
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,890
You'll be counted at Hebron.

20
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,020
-Name?    -Samuel.

21
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,350
-What city?    -Joppa.

22
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,030
-What family?   -Michael.

23
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,030
-Move on. Move on.   -Yes.

24
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,830
-Name?    -Joseph.

25
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,590
-What city?    -Nazareth.

26
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,230
-What family?    -David of Bethlehem.

27
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,630
And the woman?

28
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,000
My wife.

29
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,730
Move on. You'll be counted at Bethlehem.

30
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,340
Come on, come on.

31
00:11:55,430 --> 00:12:00,340


32
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:06,400


33
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:15,380


34
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:21,380


35
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,390


36
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,390


37
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:41,430


38
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:46,500


39
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:54,470


40
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,020
What village is this?

41
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,420
Nazareth.

42
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,700
We should arrive in Jerusalem tomorrow night.

43
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,740
You're not watching the soldiers, Joseph?

44
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,180
We've seen Romans before.

45
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,450
Yes...

46
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,680
...and we will see them again.

47
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,730
My table is not finished.

48
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,530
Where is your son?

49
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,030
He's walking in the hills.

50
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,940
He neglects his work, Joseph.

51
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,540
No.

52
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,280
Once, I reproached him with forgetting his work. He said to me:

53
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,140
" I must be about my father's business. "

54
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,910
Then why isn't he here, working?

55
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,560
He's working.

56
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,760
Trumpeters of the legion!

57
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,520
Welcome, Messala.

58
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,460
The command is yours.

59
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,100
Thank you.

60
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,100
Thank you for relieving me.

61
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:22,010
Drusus...

62
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:28,340
...when I was a boy, I dreamed of commanding this garrison.

63
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,250
Now the wheel has turned.

64
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,860
I am in command.

65
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,600
Attention!

66
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:51,900
Aisle one, face right!

67
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,270
Forward!

68
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,980
I'd forgotten the heat.

69
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,290
If it were only the heat.

70
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,420
I lived here until I was 14. Jerusalem was my home.

71
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,120
-My father was head of--    -Yes, I know.

72
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:16,900
Your father is well-remembered. Fine governor.

73
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,630
If there can be such a thing in this forsaken land.

74
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:25,810
If you want to rise, Sextus, do the difficult.

75
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,970
I asked to be sent here.

76
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:33,210
You'll find the people changed since you were a boy.

77
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,120
In what way?

78
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:39,490
Oh, won't pay their taxes, an irrational resentment of Rome....

79
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,150
There's nothing new in all that.

80
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,260
And then there's religion. I tell you, they're drunk with religion.

81
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:51,400
They smash the statues of our gods, even those of the emperor.

82
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,800
Punish them.

83
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,640
We do.

84
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,440
When we can find them.

85
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,340
Find the leaders.

86
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,920
You don't know. There's nothing you can put your finger on.

87
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,520
There are strange forces at work here.

88
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,210
This "messiah" business--

89
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:14,050
I know. There was one predicted when I was a boy.

90
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:19,130
A king of the Jews, who will lead them into some sort of anti-Roman paradise.

91
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,890
Makes your head spin.

92
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,970
There's a wild man in the desert named John...

93
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:26,200
...who drowns people in water.

94
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:30,340
And a carpenter's son who does magic tricks. "Miracles" they call them.

95
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,010
There's always a rabble-rouser stirring up trouble.

96
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,440
No, no, no. This man is different.

97
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:39,310
He teaches that God is near, in every man.

98
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,450
It's actually quite profound, some of it.

99
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,390
You've been too long away from Rome.

100
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,030
Go back, Sextus.

101
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,660
Go to Capri. Bathe, rest, lie by the sea...

102
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:56,060
...and forget that God is in every man.

103
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,300
-There is divinity in only one man. -Yes, I know.

104
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,970
The emperor is displeased.

105
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,210
He wishes Judea made into a more obedient and disciplined province.

106
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:10,640
He's ordered me to restore order. I shall carry out his wishes.

107
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:15,340
How? You can break a man's skull, arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.

108
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:18,790
But how do you control this? How do you fight an idea?

109
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,820
Especially a new idea.

110
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:28,530
There's a Jew outside. He wants to see the tribune Messala.

111
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,970
I assume he has a name.

112
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:35,270
-He says he's a prince, Judah Ben-Hur. -Then treat him like one!

113
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,940
Tell him I will join him.

114
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,380
Yes, tribune.

115
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,540
Centurion!

116
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:53,880
This was his country before it was ours.

117
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,550
Don't forget that.

118
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,460
Yes, tribune.

119
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,970
Very wise. This Ben-Hur is the richest man in Jerusalem.

120
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:11,000
And the head of one of the greatest families in Judea.

121
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,140
We were friends as boys.

122
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,440
We were like brothers.

123
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,040
Sextus...

124
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:23,080
...you ask how to fight an idea.

125
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,250
Well, I'll tell you how.

126
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,480
With another idea.

127
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,130
I said I'd come back.

128
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,500
I never thought you would.

129
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,960
l'm so glad.

130
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,450
-Look at you.   -Look at you!

131
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,880
You've come back a tribune.

132
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,060
When I heard that news, I drank a toast to you.

133
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,720
We'll drink another now.

134
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,900
-Your sister and mother? -They're fine.

135
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,000
They've talked of you ever since we knew you were coming.

136
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,600
-Is Tirzah married?    -No.

137
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,500
Suitors come and go, but she dreams.

138
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:50,230
She's been in love with you since she was 5.

139
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,600
I can't wait to see them.

140
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:55,300
Do you still hunt jackals and lions?

141
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:58,240
Or have you become too dignified?

142
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:19,530
-Down Eros, up Mars! -Down Eros, up Mars!

143
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,340
Where the beams cross?

144
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,420
Good.

145
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,110
After all these years!

146
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,040
Still close.

147
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,910
In every way.

148
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,330
I hope so.

149
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,290
I know.

150
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,470
You're a Roman, and l'm a Jew...

151
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,430
...whose life you once saved.

152
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,240
The best thing I ever did.

153
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,110
Judah...

154
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,880
...it will be very difficult to govern here.

155
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,680
l'm going to need help.

156
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,750
Your help. Your advice.

157
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,300
-You want my advice?    -Yes, I do.

158
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,860
Withdraw your legions.

159
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,900
Give us our freedom.

160
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:07,640
Unfortunately, the emperor is devoted to his empire.

161
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:10,140
He's particularly fond of Judea.

162
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,180
And Judea's not fond of the emperor.

163
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:17,010
Is there anything so sad as unrequited love?

164
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,160
My quarters.

165
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,590
A bit grim.

166
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,230
Not grim.

167
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:30,990
Austere. Virtuous.

168
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,730
Roman.

169
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:41,600
l'm going to be second-in-command to the new governor, Valerius Gratus.

170
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:44,140
He's coming in a few days with more legions.

171
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:48,350
Then the rumors are true.

172
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:54,560
The emperor does not approve of your countrymen.

173
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:58,720
There is rebellion in the wind. It will be crushed.

174
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,340
But you and your family need have no concern.

175
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:09,340
l'm next in authority to the governor, and you're my friend.

176
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:12,530
-l'm a Jew.   -Ah, you are like a Roman!

177
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,200
What have you in common with the troublemaking rabble?

178
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:19,850
-They're my people. l'm one of them. -Be wise, Judah.

179
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:24,110
It's a Roman world. If you want to live in it, you must become part of it.

180
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,180
You've changed.

181
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:29,880
I've grown up. I've seen the world since I left Jerusalem.

182
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,860
I've seen Rome. It's no accident that one small village on the Tiber...

183
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,760
...was chosen to rule the world.

184
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,700
Your legions.

185
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,740
It wasn't just our legions.

186
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:46,410
Other countries have armies, fine armies. I know, I fought them.

187
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:47,740
Oh, no.

188
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:53,110
No, it was fate that chose us to civilize the world. And we have.

189
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:56,380
Our roads and ships connect every corner of the earth.

190
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:00,020
Roman law, architecture, literature are the glory of the human race.

191
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,690
I believe in the future of my people.

192
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,530
Of course you do. And you can help them.

193
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,990
How?

194
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,600
You're an aristocrat.

195
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,140
Your family's name is honored. You're a prince to your people.

196
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:18,040
You're rich and powerful. Your reputation is stainless.

197
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,730
They'd listen if you spoke out against rebellion.

198
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:24,280
Persuade your people that their resistance to Rome is stupid.

199
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,850
It is worse than stupid, futile!

200
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:30,580
For it can end in only one way, extinction for your people!

201
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:39,090
l'm against violence. Everyone knows this.

202
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,930
I've spoken against it. I shall do so again.

203
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,500
Then we're agreed!

204
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:47,700
Now, when can I come to see your family?

205
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:52,480
-We had hoped tomorrow.    -Good.

206
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:56,410
And now for our toast.

207
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,540
It's dreadful wine, by the way.

208
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,220
It's especially fermented for the Roman army.

209
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,420
You're very cruel to your conquerors.

210
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,360
It's an insane world.

211
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:19,340
But in it there is one sanity:

212
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:22,470
The loyalty of old friends.

213
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:27,170
Judah, we must believe in one another.

214
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,570
Will you drink to that?

215
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,550
With all my heart.

216
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:58,040
Here it is, the place I've remembered.

217
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,110
The court where we played at changing the guard.

218
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:05,480
The roof where we'd throw pebbles at people in the street and then hide.

219
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:09,080
-We were rascals, weren't we? -No, you were good boys.

220
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,380
I would have that time again.

221
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:14,060
And here it is. Nothing has changed.

222
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,730
Except for the fountain.

223
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:20,060
-The old well would go dry, remember? -Promptly, every summer.

224
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:25,060
A new fountain and a new Tirzah. You've grown up.

225
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:28,870
-He hasn't changed, has he, Mother? -No?

226
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:33,640
Of course he has. He was a boy when he left us, now he's a man.

227
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:36,140
With great responsibilities.

228
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,470
Come.

229
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:43,040
The emperor builds and builds, turning brick to marble.

230
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,190
Oh, I almost forgot. I brought you this.

231
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:54,390
I've never seen anything like this before. It's beautiful!

232
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,590
-Is it Roman? -It's Libyan. I was there last year.

233
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,290
A tremendous campaign.

234
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,030
Our armies met on the coast. After two days of fighting, they fled.

235
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,440
We marched on their capital. Barbaric city, but fascinating.

236
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:08,510
Or was, till we destroyed it.

237
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,580
Now it's nothing but ashes.

238
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:17,120
l'm boring you with soldier stories.

239
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:21,220
Come with me, there's something I want to show you.

240
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:23,390
Thank you for this.

241
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,530
I chose the right present for you. It's a brooch for a woman.

242
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,810
What do you think of it?

243
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,940
Magnificent.

244
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,410
It's Arabic.

245
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:57,060
I think he has the look of the breed. I've raised him.

246
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:58,960
Let me try him sometime.

247
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,660
Whenever you like. He's yours.

248
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,770
Do you mean you'll give me this?

249
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:09,030
Oh, Judah.

250
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:14,910
You are good. It's going to be like old times, I know it.

251
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,880
Judah, tell me, did you...

252
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,020
...think about what I said?

253
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,990
Yes. Talked to a number of people already.

254
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:31,890
Spoken against violence, against incidents.

255
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,000
Most of the men agree with me.

256
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,170
Most? Not all?

257
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,300
No, not all.

258
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,730
Who does not agree?

259
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,910
Well, the resentful, the impatient.

260
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,170
Who are they?

261
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:51,380
Yes, Judah. Who are they?

262
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:01,260
Would I retain your friendship if I became an informer?

263
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,690
Telling the names of criminals is not informing.

264
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,690
They're not criminals, Messala. They're patriots.

265
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,420
Patriots?!

266
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:20,200
Let me explain something to you. Something you may not know.

267
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:25,620
The emperor is watching us. At this moment, he watches the East.

268
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,820
This is my great opportunity, and yours too.

269
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,490
If I bring order here, I can have any post I want.

270
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:34,990
You'll rise with me, I promise. And do you know where it can end?

271
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:38,220
Rome! Yes, perhaps at the side of Caesar himself.

272
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:41,130
I mean it. It can happen and this is the moment.

273
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:43,100
I swear, this is the time.

274
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:47,170
The emperor is watching us, judging us. All I need do is serve him.

275
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:50,860
And all you need do is help me serve him.

276
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,610
-You speak as if he were God. -He is God. The only God.

277
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,880
He is power, real power on earth, not--

278
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,010
Not that.

279
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,820
Help me, Judah.

280
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:13,020
I would do anything for you, Messala...

281
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:16,560
...except betray my own people.

282
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:21,340
In the name of all the gods, what do the lives of a few Jews mean to you?

283
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:29,010
If I cannot persuade them, that does not mean I would help you murder them.

284
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:34,780
Besides, you must understand this, Messala.

285
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:37,680
I believe in the past and future of my people.

286
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,550
Future? You are a conquered people.

287
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:46,320
You may conquer the land. You may slaughter the people.

288
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:48,660
But that is not the end. We will rise again.

289
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:53,160
You live on dead dreams. You live on the myths of the past.

290
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:55,770
Solomon's glory is gone. You think it will return?

291
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:58,940
Joshua will not rise again to save you nor David.

292
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:03,050
There is only one reality in the world today. Look to the West.

293
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,680
Don't be a fool! Look to Rome!

294
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,940
Better a fool than a traitor or a killer.

295
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:09,950
-I am a soldier. -Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil.

296
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,090
-I warn you--     -No! I warn you.

297
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:15,050
Rome is an affront to God.

298
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:18,660
Rome is strangling my people and my country, the whole earth!

299
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,300
But not forever.

300
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:24,260
And I tell you, the day Rome falls there will be a shout of freedom...

301
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:27,230
...such as the world has never heard before.

302
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:40,220
Either you help me or you oppose me. You have no other choice.

303
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:43,550
You're either for me or against me.

304
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,330
If that is the choice...

305
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:54,830
...then I am against you.

306
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,660
There they are.

307
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,860
Where's Messala?

308
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:30,460
-Where's--?   -He's gone.

309
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,470
Gone?

310
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,540
-But why?    -He couldn't stay.

311
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:39,200
-What happened? -A new tribune must have many duties.

312
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:42,210
Come. Let us have dinner.

313
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:59,400
Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the world...

314
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,000
...who bringeth to us bread from the earth.

315
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:11,000
We shall never see him again, Tirzah.

316
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:17,710
He wanted to use me to betray our people.

317
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:10,690
-Master, the caravan from Antioch. -Yes, Amrah, I saw.

318
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,400
Simonides.

319
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,140
Welcome.

320
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,870
-Oh, welcome homecoming.    -Master.

321
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,670
Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.

322
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,680
Amber and jade for me. Silk for Tirzah.

323
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,750
And for the master, liberian wine.

324
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:30,940
Not to mention the best gift of all, your presence.

325
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,890
You do your servant honor. I also bring good news from Antioch.

326
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:37,720
-Caravans from Petra. -Have all arrived.

327
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:39,730
-Good.   -Here is the accounting.

328
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:41,300
And what of Numidia?

329
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:45,130
The trade route is ours, guaranteed by treaty with the king.

330
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,930
Once a year, you bring your accounting.

331
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:51,010
And once a year, I find myself wealthier.

332
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,070
Yeah, but my greatest treasure is my steward.

333
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:56,880
My life belongs to the House of Hur.

334
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:00,480
Nothing else exists for me, except my daughter.

335
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:04,450
-She must be a young woman by now. -Yes, and your property.

336
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,650
She was born the daughter of your slave.

337
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:10,420
When I inherited you, I inherited a friend, not a slave.

338
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:14,390
Still, Esther has come with me from Antioch for your permission to marry.

339
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:18,370
It's granted. I wish you the joy of many grandchildren.

340
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:21,900
If it is the Lord's will, I shall rejoice.

341
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:59,440
With your permission, Esther wishes to speak to her master.

342
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:19,760
You're eager to marry, Esther?

343
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,000
It is my father's wish.

344
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:29,230
Your husband will be fortunate.

345
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,410
What is his name?

346
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,410
David, son of Mathias.

347
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:37,170
Of what house?

348
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:40,650
-His own, master. -He is a freeman.

349
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,650
Tell me more about him.

350
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,350
I have seen him only once.

351
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,690
He is a merchant, well-thought-of in Antioch.

352
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:52,390
He will pay for Esther's freedom.

353
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:56,530
Her freedom will be my wedding gift to Esther.

354
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,670
You are generous, master.

355
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,840
Do you love this man?

356
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:17,520
I will learn to love him.

357
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,870
You have my permission to marry.

358
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:41,040
We'll drink to your happiness.

359
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,510
And a safe return to Antioch.

360
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:11,140
I disturbed you.

361
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,830
No.

362
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,170
What were you thinking?

363
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,510
I was saying goodbye...

364
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,810
...to this city...

365
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,410
...and this house.

366
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:31,760
You've not often been here. What do you remember of it?

367
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,590
My father sometimes brought me here...

368
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,460
...when I was little.

369
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,640
It was a house where I was always happy.

370
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,110
Except once.

371
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:51,350
When you and your friend, the Roman boy--

372
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,680
-Messala.    -Yes.

373
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:56,580
You had been out hunting...

374
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,520
...and they brought you home injured.

375
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,890
I touched your face as you lay there...

376
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:13,370
...and prayed to God, "Don't let this boy die."

377
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:21,540
I can hear how you said it. Gently, as you say it now.

378
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:24,640
Yes, master.

379
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:28,290
Master? Why, I've given you your freedom.

380
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:34,290
It's strange. I hardly felt a slave.

381
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,160
And now...

382
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,500
...I hardly feel free.

383
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:50,640
You know, in the old, wise days of Solomon...

384
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,970
...if there was among his slaves...

385
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,940
...some girl who filled his eyes...

386
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:59,240
...he could choose her out from the rest...

387
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:02,010
...and take her to him.

388
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:05,190
Wise days of Solomon.

389
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:08,350
Different days.

390
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,860
And long ago.

391
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:24,430
If you were not a bride...

392
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,740
...I should kiss you goodbye.

393
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,550
If I were not a bride...

394
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:35,680
...there would be no goodbyes to be said.

395
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,870
Your slave ring.

396
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:56,070
Fair exchange.

397
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:00,940
Freedom to you. The ring to me.

398
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:03,040
You will wear it?

399
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,280
Until you meet the woman you will marry?

400
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,220
Yes.

401
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:22,160
Until then.

402
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:58,650
The gods favor my lord Gratus.

403
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:02,090
If it is the governor's pleasure, the wreath of office.

404
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:04,020
Thank you, tribune.

405
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:08,560
I see no delegation from the city.

406
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:10,930
-There will not be one, sir. -No?

407
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:13,540
Jerusalem's welcome will not be a warm one.

408
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:16,470
But I pledge, my lord, it will be a quiet one.

409
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:18,740
Let us proceed.

410
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,170
There's Messala.

411
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:36,220
He saw you, Judah.

412
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:07,310
The new governor.

413
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:24,710
Stand back!

414
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:29,210
-Stand back.   -You, come!

415
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:31,280
Had to be the Jews!

416
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,490
Open up in the name of the divine emperor!

417
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:54,800
Judah! Tirzah! What is it? What's happened?

418
00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:56,840
Open up in the name of the law!

419
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,200
-I was watching the-- -A tile fell and struck the governor.

420
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:02,570
-It wasn't my fault. -They won't believe her.

421
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:06,380
She won't have to say anything. You hear? Tirzah, say nothing.

422
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,680
Open the gates!

423
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,430
I'll speak to them.

424
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,560
-Arrest him! -Let me tell you what happened.

425
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,030
-Hold those women. -Stop them!

426
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,320
It was an accident.

427
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:30,030
Let me tell you what happened. It was an accident.

428
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,770
-This is the man, sir. We saw him. -It was an accident.

429
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:36,340
-Accident?    -I swear it.

430
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:39,810
I put my hand on the ledge. A tile was loose. It gave way.

431
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,880
Take him. Take all of them.

432
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:45,990
-He's telling the truth! -It was me! Let them go!

433
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,020
Attention!

434
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:54,860
Messala.

435
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:06,070
In the name of God, tell them it's a mistake.

436
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:09,340
I leaned on the tile, and it broke loose.

437
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,180
It was an accident.

438
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:27,690
Let them go! They had nothing to do with it!

439
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,890
Let the servants go.

440
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:37,770
Let them go. Return to your ranks.

441
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,290
Come.

442
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:09,660
Where?

443
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:11,620
Tirus.

444
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:14,940
Tirus?

445
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:18,740
I've had no trial.

446
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:22,280
l'm to die in the galleys without even a trial?

447
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,210
There's no truth in the charge! Not a word of truth!

448
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:28,650
Wait. My mother, my sister. What happened to them?

449
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:30,410
Tie his hands.

450
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,590
-At least tell me if they're safe. -I can tell you nothing.

451
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,950
Get along. Keep moving.

452
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:25,400
Jailer!

453
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,070
Guard, in there!

454
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,450
Up the stairs!

455
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:32,980
Jailer!

456
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:35,980
Jailer!

457
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,380
To the right.

458
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:35,970
-Wait!  -Send them out.

459
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:39,540
Send them out.

460
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,610
Go!

461
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:52,610
The door.

462
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:03,560
Where are my mother and sister?

463
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:16,440
Where are they?

464
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:21,850
Here, within these walls.

465
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,610
The governor is recovering. They won't die.

466
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:29,850
Of course, they will be sentenced.

467
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,390
Is it possible?

468
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:41,760
Is it possible you could do this to us?

469
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:44,910
To people you've known? A family you've loved?

470
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,270
You will let them go. You will gladly let them go!

471
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:57,740
I didn't try to kill the governor. l'm not a murderer!

472
00:55:57,950 --> 00:55:59,610
I know you're not.

473
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:02,850
You know?

474
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:08,120
You are evil.

475
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:11,030
No, Judah, I am not evil.

476
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:13,530
I wanted your help.

477
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,200
Now you've given it to me.

478
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:20,270
By making this example of you, I discourage treason.

479
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:24,550
By condemning without hesitation an old friend, I shall be feared.

480
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:29,310
But not my family.

481
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:32,410
Let them go.

482
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:34,080
Please.

483
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,990
-Messala, I beg you.    -Beg?!

484
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,220
Didn't I beg you?

485
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:52,400
You chose this. There's nothing more to be said.

486
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,540
Kill me, and your mother and sister will die today...

487
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:58,140
...nailed to crosses in front of you!

488
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,840
Go on, Judah.

489
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,220
Kill me!

490
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:19,400
May God grant me vengeance.

491
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:23,470
I will pray that you live till I return.

492
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:25,530
Return?

493
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:32,210
Take him.

494
00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:10,220
Sentries, salute.

495
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:14,150
The tribune will see you now.

496
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:49,180
Tribune, l'm steward of the House of Hur.

497
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,030
I remember you.

498
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:56,130
We were on our way to Antioch when we heard what had happened.

499
00:58:56,330 --> 00:59:00,130
This is my daughter. Judah Ben-Hur could not have done this thing. You knew him, tribune.

500
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:01,860
Better than you.

501
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:06,630
Then there must be no doubt in your mind, the charge is groundless.

502
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:09,040
The prisoners have been sentenced.

503
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,570
-Sentenced? -But there's no truth in it.

504
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:15,270
There was never a threat against the governor in Judah's mind.

505
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,210
Surely you must know he would never have done this.

506
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:20,750
In your heart, you must know it.

507
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:27,290
Drusus.

508
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:35,570
This man had better be kept here until we can question him.

509
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:32,390
Hold!

510
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:30,280
Water for the soldiers.

511
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,380
Soldiers first!

512
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:37,890
Get away from that well. No water for them!

513
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:40,990
Get them away from that well! Here, you!

514
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:44,060
Come on, you! Water for the horses!

515
01:01:48,070 --> 01:01:50,970
-Water. Water. -Soldiers first!

516
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:00,870
Here.

517
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:24,970
Wait.

518
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:27,670
No water for him.

519
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:51,060
God...

520
01:02:51,870 --> 01:02:53,840
...help me.

521
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:50,520
You! I said no water for him!

522
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:27,020
All right, on your feet, all of you!

523
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:28,660
Get them on their feet!

524
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,930
Back in line, you dog!

525
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:46,380
On your feet!

526
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,180
Get them going!

527
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:54,780
You there, back to your place! Back to your place!

528
01:04:57,830 --> 01:04:59,820
Forward, you dogs!

529
01:06:05,030 --> 01:06:07,550
Soon, the counselor's barge will be coming alongside.

530
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,630
Be ready to raise oars.

531
01:06:15,870 --> 01:06:18,700
Raise oars!

532
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:23,340
Down oars!

533
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,490
The new commander, Quintus Arrius.

534
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,810
-How many rowers? -Two hundred, consul.

535
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:09,850
-And reliefs? -Of 30, every hour.

536
01:07:44,790 --> 01:07:47,960
This man is ill. Replace him.

537
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,260
-Change him. -Right, sir.

538
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:59,900
-This man's been giving you trouble? -He's insubordinate, consul.

539
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:02,180
That will stop.

540
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:28,360
What service have you seen?

541
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:31,740
Forty-one.

542
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:35,940
A month's less a day in this ship.

543
01:08:36,610 --> 01:08:40,380
You keep an exact account. And before?

544
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:44,070
Three years in other ships.

545
01:08:45,550 --> 01:08:47,450
Three years.

546
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:11,210
You have the spirit to fight back...

547
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:14,080
...but the good sense to control it.

548
01:09:17,490 --> 01:09:21,290
Your eyes are full of hate, 41 .

549
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:25,890
That's good. Hate keeps a man alive.

550
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:28,060
It gives him strength.

551
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:31,760
Now, listen to me, all of you.

552
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:34,470
You are all condemned men.

553
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,730
We keep you alive to serve this ship.

554
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:43,410
So row well...

555
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:45,910
...and live.

556
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:57,150
-Ship ready, consul. -Strike oars.

557
01:09:57,390 --> 01:10:01,020
Strike oars!

558
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:23,750
You know a fleet of Macedonian galleys...

559
01:10:23,950 --> 01:10:26,790
...has been raiding Roman commerce.

560
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:30,320
The emperor has honored us with the task...

561
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:33,090
...of seeking out and destroying them.

562
01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:06,860
Battle speed, hortator.

563
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:11,400
Battle speed!

564
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:43,160
Attack speed.

565
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:45,460
Attack speed!

566
01:12:25,810 --> 01:12:27,040
Ramming speed.

567
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:29,830
Ramming speed!

568
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:45,080
Rest.

569
01:13:45,850 --> 01:13:47,450
Halt!

570
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:49,890
Rest!

571
01:14:53,090 --> 01:14:54,250
Why are you here?

572
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:57,890
I was ordered to report to you during my relief.

573
01:14:59,990 --> 01:15:01,760
Oh, yes.

574
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:03,890
I'd forgotten.

575
01:15:10,170 --> 01:15:12,300
You could have killed me as I lay there.

576
01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:14,670
You're a condemned man. Why didn't you?

577
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:17,330
l'm not ready to die.

578
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:19,680
What do you think will save you?

579
01:15:20,150 --> 01:15:22,510
The God of my fathers.

580
01:15:24,050 --> 01:15:26,040
Your God has forsaken you.

581
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:29,490
He has no more power than the images I pray to.

582
01:15:29,690 --> 01:15:33,520
My gods will not help me. Your God will not help you.

583
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:35,190
I might.

584
01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:38,560
Does that interest you, 41 ?

585
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,690
I can see that it does.

586
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:47,200
l'm a fighting man by profession, and in my leisure moments...

587
01:15:47,410 --> 01:15:50,210
...it amuses me to train fighting men.

588
01:15:50,410 --> 01:15:53,540
I own some of the best gladiators and charioteers in Rome.

589
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:55,980
Would you like to become one of them?

590
01:15:56,380 --> 01:15:58,320
To die as your slave?

591
01:15:58,790 --> 01:16:01,080
Better than to live in chains below these decks.

592
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:03,750
I will not be here forever.

593
01:16:05,190 --> 01:16:06,180
No?

594
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:13,160
What would you do if you escaped?

595
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:18,400
Two people were condemned with me, my mother and sister...

596
01:16:18,610 --> 01:16:20,870
...though they were innocent. I won't rest--

597
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:22,940
Do not say that you were innocent.

598
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:26,410
-Would it do any good to say it again? -No.

599
01:16:27,110 --> 01:16:31,740
Consider my offer carefully. You will never escape while we are victorious.

600
01:16:31,950 --> 01:16:36,150
If we are not, you will sink with this ship, chained to your oar.

601
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:39,360
I cannot believe that God has let me live these years...

602
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:41,320
...to die chained to an oar.

603
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:45,090
It's a strange, stubborn faith you keep...

604
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:48,230
...to believe that existence has a purpose.

605
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:52,630
A sane man would have learned to lose it long before this.

606
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:54,360
As you have.

607
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:57,200
What drove it out of you?

608
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:01,340
Go back to your oar, 41 .

609
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:19,920
Consul, enemy sighted.

610
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:23,460
Signal the fleet. Prepare for battle.

611
01:17:30,310 --> 01:17:33,140
All the watch to battle posts.

612
01:17:38,090 --> 01:17:40,250
-Stand by to load. -Make ready to fire.

613
01:17:40,450 --> 01:17:41,890
Hurry, quick!

614
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:47,160
Hurry up with that resin. Get some more ammunition.

615
01:17:52,770 --> 01:17:54,890
Raise oars!

616
01:17:56,070 --> 01:17:58,440
Down oars!

617
01:17:58,810 --> 01:17:59,800
Chain rowers!

618
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:24,030
Guard.

619
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:28,190
Unlock 41.

620
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:30,900
No! I don't want to die!

621
01:18:31,110 --> 01:18:32,830
I don't want to die!

622
01:19:03,370 --> 01:19:06,530
41 , why did he do that?

623
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:08,740
I don't know.

624
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:14,480
Once before, a man helped me.

625
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:17,440
I didn't know why then.

626
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:22,220
Normal speed!

627
01:19:58,330 --> 01:20:00,560
Number 1 , flame.

628
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:02,720
Fire.

629
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:16,470
Fire!

630
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:18,200
Fire!

631
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,850
Hold withdrawal on command.

632
01:20:27,350 --> 01:20:30,150
Lift oars! Raise!

633
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:32,360
Withdraw!

634
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,020
Steersman, right.

635
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,530
Extend oars!

636
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:48,440
Fire!

637
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:11,520
-Watch out! -Fire!

638
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:31,170
Steersman, ram course! Order below!

639
01:21:31,390 --> 01:21:32,720
Ramming speed!

640
01:21:45,070 --> 01:21:47,560
Consul, barge on ramming course.

641
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:58,840
We're going to be rammed! We're going to be rammed!

642
01:26:53,466 --> 01:26:55,536
Why did you save me?

643
01:26:57,576 --> 01:27:00,896
Why did you have me unchained?

644
01:27:21,566 --> 01:27:24,126
What is your name, 41 ?

645
01:27:26,396 --> 01:27:27,956
Judah Ben-Hur.

646
01:27:28,936 --> 01:27:30,866
Judah Ben-Hur...

647
01:27:32,506 --> 01:27:33,836
...let me die.

648
01:27:37,076 --> 01:27:40,346
We keep you alive to serve this ship.

649
01:27:40,816 --> 01:27:42,306
Row well and live.

650
01:27:58,336 --> 01:27:59,626
Is the sail square?

651
01:28:01,636 --> 01:28:03,536
l can't tell.

652
01:28:05,006 --> 01:28:07,566
Better for us both if it's the enemy.

653
01:28:08,976 --> 01:28:10,036
My death.

654
01:28:10,646 --> 01:28:12,336
Your freedom.

655
01:28:16,986 --> 01:28:19,106
It's a Roman sail.

656
01:28:48,846 --> 01:28:50,276
Face rear!

657
01:28:50,486 --> 01:28:54,546
Welcome, consul. We had given up all hope for you.

658
01:28:57,956 --> 01:28:59,116
Water.

659
01:29:03,526 --> 01:29:05,556
The fleet, all lost?

660
01:29:05,766 --> 01:29:07,426
Five galleys.

661
01:29:08,066 --> 01:29:11,366
-And the battle? -The battle was won.

662
01:29:11,766 --> 01:29:13,096
You have a victory.

663
01:29:14,136 --> 01:29:16,766
-It was a victory? -Complete.

664
01:29:35,456 --> 01:29:37,686
ln His eagerness to save you...

665
01:29:37,896 --> 01:29:41,596
...your God has also saved the Roman fleet.

666
01:30:16,066 --> 01:30:18,666
Hail Arrius!

667
01:30:21,236 --> 01:30:23,336
Right oars!

668
01:33:16,786 --> 01:33:21,306
You have cleared the seaways of a great danger, Quintus Arrius.

669
01:33:22,186 --> 01:33:25,676
This baton of victory has been nobly won.

670
01:33:33,536 --> 01:33:36,526
This man riding beside you, who is he?

671
01:33:36,936 --> 01:33:40,026
The man who saved me, divine emperor, to return and serve you.

672
01:33:40,236 --> 01:33:42,266
Is that all you know about him?

673
01:33:44,746 --> 01:33:49,506
No. He was accused of an attack on the governor of Judea.

674
01:33:49,746 --> 01:33:51,646
But he was innocent.

675
01:33:51,846 --> 01:33:54,576
If not, there's a strange inconsistency in this man...

676
01:33:54,786 --> 01:33:59,246
...who tries to kill my governor, yet saves the life of my consul.

677
01:34:00,196 --> 01:34:03,156
Come tomorrow. We'll talk of it.

678
01:34:32,886 --> 01:34:35,796
We have all the information on this man...

679
01:34:35,996 --> 01:34:38,466
...a man of some influence in his own country.

680
01:34:38,826 --> 01:34:43,026
His attack upon our governor is one upon the senate and the people of Rome.

681
01:34:43,236 --> 01:34:46,106
l am convinced that no such attack was intended.

682
01:34:46,506 --> 01:34:49,906
Consul, allow us to continue.

683
01:34:51,106 --> 01:34:53,506
Allow us to be generous.

684
01:34:54,716 --> 01:34:57,976
As a reward to you for your great victory...

685
01:34:58,316 --> 01:35:00,786
...we shall not send him back to the galleys.

686
01:35:00,986 --> 01:35:03,076
We give him to you as your slave.

687
01:35:06,526 --> 01:35:08,826
Such is the will of the senate...

688
01:35:09,696 --> 01:35:11,626
...and the people of Rome.

689
01:36:32,246 --> 01:36:34,546
Not long ago, I returned to Rome...

690
01:36:34,746 --> 01:36:37,506
...with a young man who had saved my life.

691
01:36:37,716 --> 01:36:40,976
You all know him as the finest charioteer in Rome.

692
01:36:41,186 --> 01:36:44,676
Five times, he's driven my horses to victory.

693
01:36:50,966 --> 01:36:55,656
l know him as one who stands in the place of the son I lost.

694
01:36:56,736 --> 01:36:59,396
l have the love and pride in a son's achievements...

695
01:36:59,836 --> 01:37:02,036
...which I thought I should never have again.

696
01:37:07,446 --> 01:37:09,606
Nothing could make stronger our bond...

697
01:37:09,816 --> 01:37:12,336
...but tonight I wish to share it with you all.

698
01:37:13,516 --> 01:37:17,506
The formalities of adoption have been completed.

699
01:37:17,726 --> 01:37:20,846
Young Arrius is now the legal bearer of my name...

700
01:37:21,056 --> 01:37:23,286
...and the heir to my property.

701
01:37:27,936 --> 01:37:30,296
This ring of my ancestors...

702
01:37:30,936 --> 01:37:32,956
...would have gone to my son.

703
01:37:34,336 --> 01:37:36,966
So now it is yours.

704
01:37:58,026 --> 01:38:02,766
It's a strange destiny that brought me to a new life...

705
01:38:03,566 --> 01:38:05,156
...a new home...

706
01:38:06,136 --> 01:38:07,626
...a new father.

707
01:38:09,106 --> 01:38:11,236
It brought me here.

708
01:38:11,946 --> 01:38:13,906
It may take me away.

709
01:38:14,716 --> 01:38:16,476
But wherever I may be...

710
01:38:16,786 --> 01:38:20,946
...l shall always try to wear this ring as a son of Arrius should.

711
01:38:21,456 --> 01:38:24,576
With gratitude and affection...

712
01:38:25,826 --> 01:38:27,156
...and with honor.

713
01:38:46,776 --> 01:38:49,336
My old friend Pontius Pilate, young Arrius.

714
01:38:49,546 --> 01:38:52,706
Before you came to this city, my horses always won.

715
01:38:52,916 --> 01:38:54,906
Magnificent horses, extremely swift.

716
01:38:55,116 --> 01:38:57,486
Yes, but not swift enough to defeat you.

717
01:38:57,686 --> 01:39:00,086
-Tell me, you come from Judea? -Yes, sir.

718
01:39:00,296 --> 01:39:03,156
l hear that the climate is difficult to live in.

719
01:39:03,356 --> 01:39:05,256
Not for Judeans.

720
01:39:08,896 --> 01:39:12,236
It's a terrible prospect. I am to be made governor.

721
01:39:12,436 --> 01:39:14,236
-Of Judea?    -Yes.

722
01:39:14,436 --> 01:39:15,906
I asked for Alexandria.

723
01:39:16,106 --> 01:39:18,936
But it seems the wilderness needs my particular talents.

724
01:39:19,146 --> 01:39:22,276
The scorpions and holy prophets can't get on without me.

725
01:39:22,476 --> 01:39:25,936
Lay the dust of Judea, at least for this evening.

726
01:39:26,146 --> 01:39:28,616
Goats and Jehovah.

727
01:39:47,106 --> 01:39:48,536
You're leaving.

728
01:39:51,706 --> 01:39:53,146
I must.

729
01:39:54,546 --> 01:39:57,036
It's a journey I can't keep you from.

730
01:39:58,546 --> 01:40:03,046
Your eyes have never left it all these months. I can recognize pain.

731
01:40:03,256 --> 01:40:06,956
But still, my counsel is to wait.

732
01:40:07,156 --> 01:40:09,646
Gratus is to be replaced.

733
01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:13,026
The governorship goes to Pontius Pilate.

734
01:40:16,936 --> 01:40:18,056
When?

735
01:40:18,506 --> 01:40:19,996
Very soon.

736
01:40:20,536 --> 01:40:22,866
It's very much to our purpose.

737
01:40:24,046 --> 01:40:28,606
Nothing is to the purpose if, when l come back to Judea, I come too late.

738
01:40:31,786 --> 01:40:36,046
That is the thought which has punished me every moment l've spent here.

739
01:40:43,026 --> 01:40:45,326
Will Rome see you again?

740
01:40:52,466 --> 01:40:55,966
Here is a part of my life which you have made for me.

741
01:40:57,576 --> 01:40:59,436
I shall remember it.

742
01:41:02,646 --> 01:41:07,046
Whoever the gods are, they take small interest in an old man's hopes.

743
01:41:07,986 --> 01:41:09,676
They have their way.

744
01:42:50,156 --> 01:42:51,646
Forgive me.

745
01:42:52,026 --> 01:42:54,256
You're a stranger here.

746
01:42:55,496 --> 01:42:57,896
Would you be from Nazareth?

747
01:43:00,166 --> 01:43:01,596
Why do you ask?

748
01:43:02,036 --> 01:43:03,026
I thought...

749
01:43:04,736 --> 01:43:06,996
...you might be the one--

750
01:43:09,006 --> 01:43:12,536
The one that I have come back from my country to find.

751
01:43:16,516 --> 01:43:19,006
He would be about your age.

752
01:43:20,186 --> 01:43:21,016
Who?

753
01:43:24,726 --> 01:43:26,556
When I find Him...

754
01:43:27,896 --> 01:43:29,486
...I shall know Him.

755
01:43:34,796 --> 01:43:38,196
Oh, but forgive me. I am Balthasar of Alexandria.

756
01:43:38,406 --> 01:43:40,896
I am the guest of Sheik llderim.

757
01:43:41,806 --> 01:43:43,536
Sack of flesh without brains!

758
01:43:43,736 --> 01:43:46,536
No! No! Not the whip!

759
01:43:48,116 --> 01:43:49,206
That is my host.

760
01:43:49,416 --> 01:43:50,606
Gently! Gently!

761
01:43:51,186 --> 01:43:54,706
Fool! Headless toad! You know nothing of horses!

762
01:43:54,916 --> 01:43:58,316
Whip my children once and I'll drain every drop of your blood.

763
01:43:58,526 --> 01:44:02,616
Now, gently around the first turn, and let them run! Go on!

764
01:44:07,836 --> 01:44:11,356
Keep my words in your head! Let us see some wisdom!

765
01:44:12,166 --> 01:44:13,436
Beautiful horses.

766
01:44:25,146 --> 01:44:27,586
Now! Now! They are ready! Let them go!

767
01:44:34,356 --> 01:44:36,756
Watch. They'll never hold the turn.

768
01:44:38,996 --> 01:44:41,526
No! No!

769
01:44:43,366 --> 01:44:45,526
Abadon, stop him!

770
01:44:47,536 --> 01:44:48,976
Stop that whip!

771
01:44:49,176 --> 01:44:51,166
I'll kill him! I'll kill--!

772
01:44:56,616 --> 01:44:59,776
Moonhead! Give me those reins, you fool!

773
01:45:02,886 --> 01:45:05,646
You think you can treat my horses like animals?!

774
01:45:07,126 --> 01:45:10,026
Drive cows and goats! That's all you're fit for!

775
01:45:10,226 --> 01:45:11,816
Get off, idiot!

776
01:45:17,166 --> 01:45:18,756
Drive goats, not horses!

777
01:45:18,966 --> 01:45:21,166
I am doomed. You saw what happened here?

778
01:45:21,376 --> 01:45:24,606
This traveler told what would happen before it happened.

779
01:45:26,546 --> 01:45:29,476
Your horses are very fine, but they're not a team.

780
01:45:29,676 --> 01:45:31,076
Not a team?

781
01:45:31,286 --> 01:45:34,146
But one of them held steady, the one on the outside.

782
01:45:34,356 --> 01:45:36,646
-Antares.   -The slow one?

783
01:45:36,856 --> 01:45:41,226
He should run on the inside where he can steady the others in the turns.

784
01:45:46,966 --> 01:45:50,396
You have a keen eye. Where did you acquire it?

785
01:45:50,606 --> 01:45:52,466
In the circus in Rome.

786
01:45:54,506 --> 01:45:57,026
You have driven in the great circus?

787
01:45:58,806 --> 01:46:03,146
Tell me, my friend, could you make my four run as one?

788
01:46:03,346 --> 01:46:04,936
I'm on my way to Jerusalem.

789
01:46:05,146 --> 01:46:07,246
Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?

790
01:46:07,456 --> 01:46:09,546
We have time enough to eat, drink and talk.

791
01:46:09,756 --> 01:46:11,946
Come into my tent and refresh yourself.

792
01:46:12,156 --> 01:46:15,526
And let me hear how you raced in Rome.

793
01:46:17,396 --> 01:46:21,326
If I had a voice to sing, I would sing you the psalm of horses.

794
01:46:21,536 --> 01:46:24,226
No other animal has descended so in scale...

795
01:46:24,436 --> 01:46:27,026
...from the first innocent falling of the world.

796
01:46:28,106 --> 01:46:31,836
And tomorrow, I shall put Antares on the inside.

797
01:46:32,046 --> 01:46:35,496
When you do, shorten the yoke. It will help them in the turns.

798
01:46:36,016 --> 01:46:37,986
Judah Ben-Hur.

799
01:46:38,186 --> 01:46:41,086
You're a Jew, yet you drove in the great circus.

800
01:46:41,286 --> 01:46:42,416
Yes.

801
01:46:43,986 --> 01:46:48,016
By a strange choice and a stranger fortune.

802
01:46:48,856 --> 01:46:51,486
Your coming here was so fit, so right.

803
01:46:51,696 --> 01:46:54,256
We might have achieved wonders!

804
01:46:54,466 --> 01:46:56,326
You have to go.

805
01:47:00,706 --> 01:47:02,726
I make a journey which will not wait.

806
01:47:02,936 --> 01:47:05,336
Ah, well, then perhaps you will come back.

807
01:47:05,546 --> 01:47:07,946
And when you do, bring your friends, your wives.

808
01:47:08,146 --> 01:47:09,876
I have no wives.

809
01:47:10,076 --> 01:47:12,046
No wives at all?

810
01:47:12,386 --> 01:47:14,676
I have six, no, seven.

811
01:47:14,886 --> 01:47:16,546
I've counted eight.

812
01:47:16,856 --> 01:47:20,046
And that is because he is traveling. At home, he has more.

813
01:47:20,256 --> 01:47:23,626
Believe me, it is a great advantage to have many wives.

814
01:47:23,826 --> 01:47:26,526
-Someday, I hope to have one. -One wife!

815
01:47:26,726 --> 01:47:31,166
One God, that I can understand. But one wife, that is not civilized.

816
01:47:31,466 --> 01:47:33,436
It is not generous.

817
01:47:38,706 --> 01:47:42,436
-Was the food not to your liking? -Indeed.

818
01:47:54,426 --> 01:47:56,356
Thank you. Thank you.

819
01:47:56,556 --> 01:48:01,156
And take my advice, my friend. Buy yourself some wives.

820
01:48:02,396 --> 01:48:06,026
And now I must say good night to my beauties.

821
01:48:06,666 --> 01:48:09,436
When ready for sleep, they get impatient and jealous.

822
01:48:09,636 --> 01:48:12,506
They wait to see which one I will embrace first.

823
01:48:13,006 --> 01:48:15,406
-I'll make my farewells then. -No, no, no, stay.

824
01:48:15,616 --> 01:48:17,576
Stay and see them.

825
01:48:31,426 --> 01:48:34,396
Come, my children. Come.

826
01:48:40,466 --> 01:48:42,136
Strangers make them shy.

827
01:48:43,476 --> 01:48:44,336
Come.

828
01:48:44,846 --> 01:48:47,676
Come, do not be afraid. Come.

829
01:48:53,446 --> 01:48:55,476
There, my children.

830
01:48:55,856 --> 01:48:58,716
They are descended from the Arabians of the Pharaohs...

831
01:48:58,926 --> 01:49:01,256
...and I have named them for the stars.

832
01:49:02,896 --> 01:49:04,516
Come, Antares.

833
01:49:04,726 --> 01:49:08,326
You are the slowest, and you can run all day without tiring.

834
01:49:08,536 --> 01:49:11,056
What? Yes, yes.

835
01:49:11,266 --> 01:49:15,066
Yes, I love you too. There's my good Antares.

836
01:49:15,336 --> 01:49:16,566
Come, Rigel.

837
01:49:16,776 --> 01:49:20,406
We've both supped well, and the world is good.

838
01:49:20,846 --> 01:49:22,036
There's my good Rigel.

839
01:49:24,316 --> 01:49:26,616
Yes, you are ready for sleep.

840
01:49:27,956 --> 01:49:30,416
The day's work done for you, eh?

841
01:49:31,726 --> 01:49:34,056
Yes, well, you can go to sleep in a minute.

842
01:49:34,326 --> 01:49:36,796
Good night. Good night, my treasure.

843
01:49:38,896 --> 01:49:42,126
Steady, Aldebaran. I haven't forgotten you.

844
01:49:42,336 --> 01:49:46,026
No. You are the swiftest, but you must be steady.

845
01:49:48,576 --> 01:49:50,936
Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.

846
01:49:51,146 --> 01:49:53,166
You should see their mother, Mira.

847
01:49:53,376 --> 01:49:56,436
I dare not bring her. My people couldn't bear her absence.

848
01:49:56,646 --> 01:49:58,576
All right, all right.

849
01:50:02,956 --> 01:50:06,756
You are their friend, and they do not give their affections readily.

850
01:50:07,496 --> 01:50:11,086
Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.

851
01:50:11,896 --> 01:50:16,166
Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.

852
01:50:16,866 --> 01:50:19,396
You must be strong and swift.

853
01:50:19,606 --> 01:50:22,076
Go, my children. Go.

854
01:50:26,406 --> 01:50:29,536
At Jerusalem, they'll race the world's finest teams...

855
01:50:29,746 --> 01:50:33,476
...and the champion of the East, Messala, with his black devils.

856
01:50:33,686 --> 01:50:35,376
He stops at nothing to win.

857
01:50:35,586 --> 01:50:38,456
-Messala? In the circus?    -Yes.

858
01:50:38,656 --> 01:50:40,346
You knew him?

859
01:50:41,426 --> 01:50:42,616
I know him.

860
01:50:42,956 --> 01:50:45,156
Perhaps without much liking.

861
01:50:48,766 --> 01:50:50,566
Judah Ben-Hur, My people are praying for a man...

862
01:50:50,766 --> 01:50:53,296
...to drive their team to victory over Messala.

863
01:50:53,506 --> 01:50:55,626
You could be that man, the one...

864
01:50:55,836 --> 01:50:57,996
...to stamp his arrogance into the sand.

865
01:50:58,206 --> 01:51:01,306
My horses need only a driver who is worthy of them...

866
01:51:01,516 --> 01:51:05,176
...one who will rule them with love. For him, they'd outrace the wind.

867
01:51:05,386 --> 01:51:07,116
It's not possible.

868
01:51:08,456 --> 01:51:10,076
That is a pity.

869
01:51:11,026 --> 01:51:13,116
Think of it. To break his pride...

870
01:51:13,326 --> 01:51:16,816
...to humble this tribune before the very people he has degraded.

871
01:51:17,026 --> 01:51:21,526
Just think, his defeat and humiliation at the hands of a Jew!

872
01:51:22,196 --> 01:51:24,396
I know it is not possible.

873
01:51:24,766 --> 01:51:27,496
Does it not delight your imagination?

874
01:51:28,976 --> 01:51:31,306
Does it not answer your purpose?

875
01:51:32,346 --> 01:51:34,536
I must deal with Messala in my own way.

876
01:51:35,176 --> 01:51:37,406
And your way is to kill him.

877
01:51:41,156 --> 01:51:44,086
l see this terrible thing in your eyes. Judah Ben-Hur.

878
01:51:44,386 --> 01:51:48,656
But no matter what this man has done to you, you have no right to kill him.

879
01:51:49,056 --> 01:51:51,456
He will be punished inevitably.

880
01:51:52,526 --> 01:51:54,156
l don't believe in miracles.

881
01:51:55,166 --> 01:51:57,136
But all life is a miracle.

882
01:51:57,336 --> 01:51:59,666
Why will you not accept God's judgment?

883
01:52:02,536 --> 01:52:04,436
You do not believe in miracles.

884
01:52:05,306 --> 01:52:08,336
Yet God once spoke to me out of the darkness...

885
01:52:08,546 --> 01:52:11,246
...and a star led me to a village called Bethlehem...

886
01:52:11,446 --> 01:52:14,546
...where I found a newborn child in a manger.

887
01:52:14,756 --> 01:52:16,586
And God lived in this child.

888
01:52:17,726 --> 01:52:21,656
By now, He is a grown man and must be ready to begin his work.

889
01:52:21,856 --> 01:52:23,556
That is why I have returned here...

890
01:52:23,756 --> 01:52:26,556
...so that I may be at hand when He comes among us.

891
01:52:28,766 --> 01:52:30,326
He is near.

892
01:52:31,366 --> 01:52:34,996
He saw the sun set this evening, as we did.

893
01:52:35,536 --> 01:52:39,436
Perhaps He's standing in a doorway somewhere or on a hilltop.

894
01:52:40,146 --> 01:52:42,306
Perhaps He is a shepherd...

895
01:52:42,516 --> 01:52:45,376
...a merchant, a fisherman.

896
01:52:45,846 --> 01:52:47,616
But He lives...

897
01:52:47,816 --> 01:52:52,116
...and all our lives from now on will carry His mark.

898
01:52:54,256 --> 01:52:57,056
There are many paths to God, my son.

899
01:52:58,196 --> 01:53:00,386
l hope yours will not be too difficult.

900
01:53:11,246 --> 01:53:13,076
I'm ready for sleep.

901
01:53:27,526 --> 01:53:29,926
Balthasar is a good man...

902
01:53:30,196 --> 01:53:34,426
...but until all men are like him, we must keep our swords bright.

903
01:53:34,736 --> 01:53:36,786
And our intention true.

904
01:53:37,936 --> 01:53:39,736
So I must leave you.

905
01:53:41,936 --> 01:53:43,806
One last thought.

906
01:53:44,006 --> 01:53:46,666
There is no law in the arena.

907
01:53:47,606 --> 01:53:49,406
Many are killed.

908
01:53:52,916 --> 01:53:54,546
l hope to see you again.

909
01:54:09,496 --> 01:54:11,866
Fine Damascus silk.

910
01:54:12,166 --> 01:54:14,466
Fine Damascus silk.

911
01:56:21,596 --> 01:56:23,036
Esther?

912
01:56:34,576 --> 01:56:36,306
It's Judah.

913
01:56:41,776 --> 01:56:43,406
Is Judah.

914
01:56:44,516 --> 01:56:46,386
You are alive.

915
01:56:46,616 --> 01:56:47,186
Yes.

916
01:56:47,556 --> 01:56:49,756
You are alive.

917
01:56:51,566 --> 01:56:55,466
What are you doing here? What has happened?

918
01:57:04,876 --> 01:57:06,276
I'm here.

919
01:57:08,216 --> 01:57:09,406
I'm with you.

920
01:57:15,856 --> 01:57:17,546
Where's your father?

921
01:57:22,556 --> 01:57:26,426
The day they took you away, they imprisoned him.

922
01:57:26,866 --> 01:57:28,626
They tortured him.

923
01:57:29,136 --> 01:57:33,656
When they were sure he was hiding nothing, they let him go.

924
01:57:35,136 --> 01:57:39,836
Ever since then, we have been living here, in hiding.

925
01:57:40,506 --> 01:57:42,706
You never went back to Antioch?

926
01:57:43,076 --> 01:57:44,206
No.

927
01:57:44,516 --> 01:57:48,956
The Romans took everything. There was nothing left for us there.

928
01:57:54,426 --> 01:57:57,416
Esther, where are my mother and sister?

929
01:58:04,196 --> 01:58:06,036
Esther?

930
01:58:07,066 --> 01:58:09,096
Let me tell him first.

931
01:58:27,626 --> 01:58:28,816
Father.

932
01:58:30,056 --> 01:58:32,826
Father, something wonderful has happened.

933
01:58:34,096 --> 01:58:36,186
Judah Ben-Hur is alive.

934
01:58:37,596 --> 01:58:41,006
He has come home. He is here.

935
01:58:58,686 --> 01:59:00,016
Judah.

936
01:59:01,826 --> 01:59:04,156
Judah Ben-Hur.

937
01:59:06,866 --> 01:59:08,956
My dear old friend.

938
01:59:10,966 --> 01:59:12,936
Let me look at you.

939
01:59:13,536 --> 01:59:15,026
Let me see you.

940
01:59:16,476 --> 01:59:19,446
Yes, yes. It is true.

941
01:59:20,146 --> 01:59:23,776
Praise God for His mercy.

942
01:59:45,336 --> 01:59:46,696
Where are they?

943
01:59:47,936 --> 01:59:51,136
Since that terrible day...

944
01:59:52,046 --> 01:59:54,606
...there has been no word of them.

945
02:00:10,426 --> 02:00:12,456
You should have been less loyal.

946
02:00:12,666 --> 02:00:14,656
Do not pity me, Master Judah.

947
02:00:14,866 --> 02:00:17,926
ln fact, I'm twice the man I was.

948
02:00:19,406 --> 02:00:23,566
There is Malluch, my other half. We met in the dungeons of the citadel.

949
02:00:23,776 --> 02:00:25,896
We were released on the same day.

950
02:00:26,106 --> 02:00:30,876
Malluch without a tongue, and I without life in my legs.

951
02:00:31,076 --> 02:00:33,546
Since then, I have been his tongue...

952
02:00:33,746 --> 02:00:35,446
...and he has been my legs.

953
02:00:35,656 --> 02:00:38,846
Together, we make a considerable man.

954
02:00:40,756 --> 02:00:42,346
Old friend.

955
02:00:43,856 --> 02:00:46,656
She always said you would return.

956
02:00:46,866 --> 02:00:49,196
She never gave up hope.

957
02:00:51,266 --> 02:00:53,826
Though I hoped it, I didn't believe it.

958
02:00:55,136 --> 02:00:58,976
l see that your one thought is to save your mother and sister.

959
02:01:00,276 --> 02:01:02,646
But suppose that isn't possible.

960
02:01:02,846 --> 02:01:05,366
If one purpose fails, it is good to have another.

961
02:01:06,286 --> 02:01:08,476
Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.

962
02:01:08,686 --> 02:01:11,556
They could not make me tell them where it is.

963
02:01:11,756 --> 02:01:12,946
It is there still...

964
02:01:13,156 --> 02:01:16,556
...to put power into our hands and buy death for the Romans.

965
02:01:19,796 --> 02:01:22,166
That's not why I came back.

966
02:01:22,396 --> 02:01:25,366
Judah, they are dead.

967
02:01:25,766 --> 02:01:30,396
Four years. No one could live so long in the dungeons.

968
02:01:35,216 --> 02:01:38,116
Who lives more than one year in the galleys?

969
02:01:38,786 --> 02:01:41,016
Yes, it is true.

970
02:01:43,386 --> 02:01:46,216
Judah Ben-Hur.

971
02:01:48,796 --> 02:01:52,626
You have come back to us like a returning faith.

972
02:01:52,866 --> 02:01:55,956
Judah, I should like to laugh again.

973
02:01:56,166 --> 02:01:57,466
-Let us laugh.   -We will.

974
02:01:57,666 --> 02:01:59,566
There will be joy again in this house.

975
02:01:59,766 --> 02:02:02,766
We will celebrate among the dust.

976
02:02:15,756 --> 02:02:17,146
l will take him.

977
02:02:48,786 --> 02:02:50,716
We stood here before.

978
02:02:53,986 --> 02:02:56,016
A long while ago.

979
02:02:57,126 --> 02:02:58,596
Four years.

980
02:03:02,396 --> 02:03:04,196
But now it seems as if...

981
02:03:04,866 --> 02:03:06,806
...only yesterday....

982
02:03:08,706 --> 02:03:10,196
l was saying:

983
02:03:12,406 --> 02:03:16,206
"If you were not a bride, l should kiss you goodbye."

984
02:03:18,246 --> 02:03:20,376
"If I were not a bride...

985
02:03:20,586 --> 02:03:23,386
...there would be no goodbyes to be said."

986
02:03:34,126 --> 02:03:35,896
l am not a bride.

987
02:04:07,866 --> 02:04:10,166
Why did you never marry?

988
02:04:12,336 --> 02:04:14,096
My father needed me.

989
02:04:18,876 --> 02:04:20,206
And also....

990
02:04:29,186 --> 02:04:31,176
It's still on my finger.

991
02:04:33,526 --> 02:04:38,256
l said I should wear it till I met a woman I would marry.

992
02:04:45,166 --> 02:04:47,866
It's become a part of my hand.

993
02:04:56,646 --> 02:04:59,706
If Messala once knew you were here....

994
02:05:00,146 --> 02:05:01,586
As he must.

995
02:05:02,156 --> 02:05:04,116
He will know where they are.

996
02:05:12,166 --> 02:05:13,926
And if you should find...?

997
02:05:16,636 --> 02:05:20,396
-If he says they're dead-- -Messala will wish they were living.

998
02:05:25,876 --> 02:05:29,136
l've seen too much of what hate can do.

999
02:05:29,776 --> 02:05:31,976
My father is burned up with it.

1000
02:05:34,046 --> 02:05:38,676
But l've heard of a young rabbi who says that forgiveness is greater...

1001
02:05:38,886 --> 02:05:41,686
...and love more powerful than hatred.

1002
02:05:42,856 --> 02:05:44,346
l believe it.

1003
02:05:44,996 --> 02:05:46,926
-Esther.  -Judah.

1004
02:05:47,466 --> 02:05:49,086
Stay alive.

1005
02:05:49,696 --> 02:05:51,666
Keep away from Messala.

1006
02:05:51,906 --> 02:05:54,766
Only if I can give up thinking and feeling.

1007
02:05:56,876 --> 02:05:58,896
That time isn't yet come.

1008
02:05:59,106 --> 02:06:03,606
The stone that fell from this roof so long ago is still falling.

1009
02:06:04,116 --> 02:06:06,806
Only this time you won't be sent to the galleys.

1010
02:06:07,016 --> 02:06:09,216
This time you will be destroyed.

1011
02:06:09,416 --> 02:06:10,976
You'll die.

1012
02:06:54,766 --> 02:06:58,356
Tribune, compliments of Quintus Arrius. He awaits your pleasure.

1013
02:06:58,566 --> 02:07:01,226
-Consul here? -Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.

1014
02:07:01,436 --> 02:07:03,526
Thank him. Bring him to me.

1015
02:07:04,376 --> 02:07:08,396
-l didn't know the consul had a son. -He's a champion of the great circus.

1016
02:07:08,616 --> 02:07:12,446
-Why is he presenting me with gifts? -Perhaps he'll race against you.

1017
02:07:14,946 --> 02:07:15,936
Look.

1018
02:07:17,886 --> 02:07:19,546
It's magnificent.

1019
02:07:19,786 --> 02:07:21,686
And from a man l've never met.

1020
02:07:21,896 --> 02:07:23,916
You're wrong, Messala.

1021
02:07:37,786 --> 02:07:40,612
Judah.

1022
02:07:48,516 --> 02:07:51,546
By what magic do you bear the name of a consul of Rome?

1023
02:07:52,886 --> 02:07:55,116
You were the magician, Messala.

1024
02:07:55,326 --> 02:07:57,656
You condemned me to the galleys.

1025
02:07:58,426 --> 02:08:01,196
When my ship was sunk, l saved the consul's life.

1026
02:08:13,446 --> 02:08:15,066
You know his seal?

1027
02:08:27,056 --> 02:08:28,986
Now I have come back...

1028
02:08:29,296 --> 02:08:31,626
...as I swore I would.

1029
02:08:37,166 --> 02:08:41,366
Your gift is exquisitely appropriate, young Arrius.

1030
02:08:42,436 --> 02:08:45,096
You suggest I use it on myself?

1031
02:08:46,646 --> 02:08:50,506
What has become of my mother and my sister?

1032
02:08:54,286 --> 02:08:57,306
It is not my duty to keep track of prisoners.

1033
02:08:57,986 --> 02:08:59,316
Find them, Messala.

1034
02:09:00,786 --> 02:09:03,346
Restore them to me, and l'll forget what I vowed...

1035
02:09:03,556 --> 02:09:07,116
...with every stroke of that oar you chained me to.

1036
02:09:10,696 --> 02:09:13,796
l am not the governor. l can do nothing without approval.

1037
02:09:14,006 --> 02:09:14,996
Then get it.

1038
02:09:19,976 --> 02:09:22,166
l will come back tomorrow.

1039
02:09:23,076 --> 02:09:25,846
Don't disappoint me, Messala.

1040
02:09:40,766 --> 02:09:42,386
What became of them?

1041
02:09:42,696 --> 02:09:46,296
It's been almost five years. Do you suppose they're still alive?

1042
02:09:46,506 --> 02:09:49,126
Go to the citadel, Drusus. Find out.

1043
02:09:49,336 --> 02:09:51,536
-And if they're dead? -They're dead!

1044
02:10:06,526 --> 02:10:09,586
"Miriam, wife. Tirzah, daughter."

1045
02:10:09,796 --> 02:10:12,316
Yes, they are the ones. Are they alive?

1046
02:10:12,766 --> 02:10:14,196
E section...

1047
02:10:15,466 --> 02:10:16,936
...lower level.

1048
02:10:18,066 --> 02:10:21,366
Cell two. Jailer on that level will know.

1049
02:10:38,986 --> 02:10:40,216
Water.

1050
02:10:40,756 --> 02:10:41,816
Water.

1051
02:10:42,496 --> 02:10:43,786
Let me out!

1052
02:11:19,366 --> 02:11:22,296
-How long since you've seen them? -Never.

1053
02:11:22,496 --> 02:11:26,556
And l've been here three years. But they're alive all right.

1054
02:11:29,836 --> 02:11:31,536
The food disappears.

1055
02:12:06,006 --> 02:12:07,336
Lepers.

1056
02:12:36,636 --> 02:12:39,536
They must be taken outside the city and released at once.

1057
02:12:39,746 --> 02:12:41,406
Then we'll burn out the cell.

1058
02:13:28,226 --> 02:13:29,716
Is someone there?

1059
02:13:35,396 --> 02:13:37,486
There is someone there.

1060
02:13:50,846 --> 02:13:52,106
Who are you?

1061
02:13:55,186 --> 02:13:56,976
Don't come any closer.

1062
02:14:00,326 --> 02:14:01,316
Who are you?

1063
02:14:04,726 --> 02:14:05,716
Esther.

1064
02:14:07,766 --> 02:14:09,056
It's Miriam.

1065
02:14:09,596 --> 02:14:10,756
Miriam.

1066
02:14:13,106 --> 02:14:14,366
Miriam?

1067
02:14:17,036 --> 02:14:19,166
Stay where you are.

1068
02:14:21,406 --> 02:14:23,276
You have come home.

1069
02:14:25,016 --> 02:14:27,106
Stand back, Esther.

1070
02:14:35,796 --> 02:14:37,256
We are lepers.

1071
02:14:50,876 --> 02:14:52,466
Oh, Esther.

1072
02:14:54,376 --> 02:14:55,706
Tirzah.

1073
02:15:04,486 --> 02:15:05,886
Esther...

1074
02:15:07,686 --> 02:15:09,986
...is Judah living?

1075
02:15:10,826 --> 02:15:13,626
Yes, he is alive.

1076
02:15:14,426 --> 02:15:16,086
He is here.

1077
02:15:18,966 --> 02:15:19,956
Where?

1078
02:15:21,936 --> 02:15:25,376
He is searching for you now.

1079
02:15:25,636 --> 02:15:28,606
l must find him and tell him.

1080
02:15:28,806 --> 02:15:30,036
-No!   -Tell my father.

1081
02:15:30,246 --> 02:15:31,406
No.

1082
02:15:32,386 --> 02:15:34,046
Tell no one.

1083
02:15:36,786 --> 02:15:40,246
We are going away to the Valley of the Lepers.

1084
02:15:40,686 --> 02:15:42,176
We won't return.

1085
02:15:45,396 --> 02:15:47,556
Judah has to be told.

1086
02:15:47,996 --> 02:15:48,986
No.

1087
02:15:52,036 --> 02:15:53,196
Please.

1088
02:16:12,456 --> 02:16:14,946
l couldn't see his face.

1089
02:16:16,726 --> 02:16:18,386
Is it changed?

1090
02:16:21,296 --> 02:16:24,356
No, he is not changed.

1091
02:16:30,036 --> 02:16:31,836
He's not changed.

1092
02:16:34,176 --> 02:16:36,266
You love him, Esther.

1093
02:16:47,386 --> 02:16:49,046
Promise me...

1094
02:16:49,726 --> 02:16:51,816
...on your love for him...

1095
02:16:53,026 --> 02:16:55,756
...you will never tell him you've seen us.

1096
02:17:04,806 --> 02:17:06,776
Is he never to know?

1097
02:17:10,776 --> 02:17:13,336
Let him remember us as we were.

1098
02:17:14,916 --> 02:17:16,176
Promise me.

1099
02:17:26,866 --> 02:17:30,096
There's nothing else I can hope for.

1100
02:17:31,196 --> 02:17:32,856
Only this.

1101
02:17:39,976 --> 02:17:41,706
l promise.

1102
02:17:45,776 --> 02:17:47,506
l am content.

1103
02:18:06,936 --> 02:18:08,096
Wait.

1104
02:18:54,216 --> 02:18:56,376
Messala will find out. l am sure of that.

1105
02:18:56,586 --> 02:19:00,686
l pray to God they're alive and that Messala will free them.

1106
02:19:00,886 --> 02:19:02,756
He'll free them.

1107
02:19:02,956 --> 02:19:05,086
He wants to survive.

1108
02:19:06,566 --> 02:19:08,396
He cannot free them, Judah.

1109
02:19:12,236 --> 02:19:13,256
What do you mean?

1110
02:19:22,406 --> 02:19:23,396
l saw them.

1111
02:19:23,846 --> 02:19:25,506
You saw them?

1112
02:19:25,716 --> 02:19:26,876
Where?

1113
02:19:27,086 --> 02:19:28,706
When did you see them?

1114
02:19:34,426 --> 02:19:35,826
They were dead.

1115
02:19:38,456 --> 02:19:40,086
They were dead.

1116
02:19:42,196 --> 02:19:43,186
When?

1117
02:19:44,936 --> 02:19:47,236
When? When?!

1118
02:19:49,606 --> 02:19:51,036
ln the prison.

1119
02:19:53,246 --> 02:19:56,146
When I was waiting for news of my father.

1120
02:20:00,716 --> 02:20:02,546
Why didn't you tell me?

1121
02:20:08,226 --> 02:20:09,686
l couldn't tell you.

1122
02:20:10,926 --> 02:20:12,686
Nor even you, Father.

1123
02:20:14,326 --> 02:20:16,726
l was afraid that if you saw Messala....

1124
02:20:17,536 --> 02:20:20,836
Judah, you have come to the end of your search.

1125
02:20:21,036 --> 02:20:22,406
It's over now.

1126
02:20:22,876 --> 02:20:24,096
Over?

1127
02:20:25,036 --> 02:20:26,636
-Judah.    -Over?

1128
02:20:26,846 --> 02:20:31,106
Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala. Go back to Rome.

1129
02:21:58,436 --> 02:21:59,696
Gentlemen.

1130
02:21:59,896 --> 02:22:00,726
Officers.

1131
02:22:02,866 --> 02:22:05,566
Defenders of great Rome's imperium...

1132
02:22:06,406 --> 02:22:08,136
...may I enter?

1133
02:22:08,806 --> 02:22:10,296
Certainly, sheik.

1134
02:22:10,706 --> 02:22:12,676
You do us an unexpected honor.

1135
02:22:13,776 --> 02:22:16,216
The noble tribune is most gracious.

1136
02:22:25,796 --> 02:22:26,786
And now...

1137
02:22:26,996 --> 02:22:28,826
...the question you're asking:

1138
02:22:29,026 --> 02:22:30,686
Why am I here?

1139
02:22:31,166 --> 02:22:33,136
As you know, I am a gambling man.

1140
02:22:33,336 --> 02:22:34,626
The games approach.

1141
02:22:34,836 --> 02:22:39,896
I am racing my whites against the noble tribune's undefeated blacks.

1142
02:22:40,106 --> 02:22:42,266
I will back my own poor horses.

1143
02:22:42,476 --> 02:22:43,996
No limits?

1144
02:23:01,096 --> 02:23:02,586
-Mark me first!   -And me!

1145
02:23:02,796 --> 02:23:04,356
-What odds?    -A moment, please...

1146
02:23:04,566 --> 02:23:07,586
...my lords, protectors of the far-flung marshes....

1147
02:23:07,796 --> 02:23:09,266
May I first sit down?

1148
02:23:09,466 --> 02:23:11,336
Sit. How much will you wager?

1149
02:23:11,536 --> 02:23:14,336
-Yes, let's call his game. -Give the Arab a seat.

1150
02:23:14,546 --> 02:23:16,446
A bench, quickly.

1151
02:23:17,546 --> 02:23:18,876
Thank you.

1152
02:23:22,246 --> 02:23:24,346
-Now.    -1000 denarii.

1153
02:23:24,556 --> 02:23:27,076
-2000!    -Mark me!

1154
02:23:27,286 --> 02:23:32,086
Your spirit does you credit, but do not be impatient. There is time.

1155
02:23:32,496 --> 02:23:35,586
First gentlemen, the odds.

1156
02:23:36,026 --> 02:23:39,586
The tribune has won many times. The odds should be in the same measure.

1157
02:23:40,666 --> 02:23:42,896
What is your pleasure, gentlemen?

1158
02:23:44,006 --> 02:23:45,296
Two to one.

1159
02:23:47,176 --> 02:23:51,266
Noble Romans, men of the Tiber, masters of the Earth...

1160
02:23:51,476 --> 02:23:55,106
...where is the courage that made Rome master of the world?

1161
02:23:55,316 --> 02:23:58,016
l can get better odds on any street market.

1162
02:23:58,856 --> 02:24:00,286
Three to one.

1163
02:24:00,786 --> 02:24:03,016
Let us not haggle. Let us be fair.

1164
02:24:03,226 --> 02:24:06,626
In four years, the tribune has won four victories in the circus.

1165
02:24:06,826 --> 02:24:09,086
-In all truth--    -Just a moment.

1166
02:24:10,166 --> 02:24:13,296
We know you have good horses, but who is your driver?

1167
02:24:15,836 --> 02:24:19,366
Did I not tell you? How careless of me.

1168
02:24:19,576 --> 02:24:21,596
The Prince of Hur.

1169
02:24:23,246 --> 02:24:25,836
Judah Ben Hur.

1170
02:24:26,046 --> 02:24:27,706
Prince of Hur?

1171
02:24:28,686 --> 02:24:31,676
-He was sent to the galleys years ago. -He has returned.

1172
02:24:31,886 --> 02:24:34,116
Returned? Impossible.

1173
02:24:34,316 --> 02:24:37,756
The divine Tiberius is merciful as always.

1174
02:24:40,526 --> 02:24:41,516
Well?

1175
02:24:41,766 --> 02:24:46,126
Will no one back the noble tribune against a Jew, a galley slave?

1176
02:24:49,636 --> 02:24:51,966
Perhaps I made a mistake in coming here.

1177
02:24:55,876 --> 02:24:57,366
You, tribune...

1178
02:24:57,676 --> 02:24:59,646
...will you give me four to one?

1179
02:25:03,916 --> 02:25:05,286
Four to one.

1180
02:25:05,556 --> 02:25:06,536
Good.

1181
02:25:07,256 --> 02:25:12,126
Four to one, sheik. The difference between a Roman and a Jew.

1182
02:25:12,326 --> 02:25:13,886
Or an Arab.

1183
02:25:19,736 --> 02:25:21,396
Bravely spoken.

1184
02:25:23,506 --> 02:25:27,836
Now we will settle the amount of our wager. I will venture...

1185
02:25:38,756 --> 02:25:40,686
A thousand talents?

1186
02:25:42,256 --> 02:25:46,316
-A thousand talents? -Yes, a thousand talents.

1187
02:25:52,166 --> 02:25:54,066
Of course, if it is too much....

1188
02:25:55,606 --> 02:25:57,656
A thousand talents it will be.

1189
02:25:58,106 --> 02:25:59,266
Agreed.

1190
02:26:46,516 --> 02:26:49,076
Treat them well. They've earned it today.

1191
02:27:00,696 --> 02:27:02,326
You're good fellows.

1192
02:27:02,636 --> 02:27:04,626
If only men were this good.

1193
02:27:07,036 --> 02:27:08,306
Remember, Altair...

1194
02:27:08,506 --> 02:27:11,166
...nine times around the circus.

1195
02:27:13,546 --> 02:27:14,806
Aldebaran.

1196
02:27:18,786 --> 02:27:20,876
Rigel, did you hear?

1197
02:27:21,086 --> 02:27:23,026
Nine lives to live.

1198
02:27:24,756 --> 02:27:26,786
My swift fellow.

1199
02:27:27,596 --> 02:27:31,056
You must not win the race the first time around.

1200
02:27:31,696 --> 02:27:34,066
You win the last time around.

1201
02:27:35,436 --> 02:27:39,636
And you cannot win alone. You must wait for the others.

1202
02:27:42,746 --> 02:27:45,076
Steady Antares.

1203
02:27:45,276 --> 02:27:46,766
Like a rock.

1204
02:27:48,286 --> 02:27:50,186
You will be our anchor.

1205
02:27:57,686 --> 02:28:00,416
I thought they'd never love another as they love me.

1206
02:28:00,626 --> 02:28:02,956
They have taken me into their family.

1207
02:28:03,966 --> 02:28:05,896
Rest well, my stars.

1208
02:28:06,096 --> 02:28:08,126
Tomorrow we go up to the city.

1209
02:28:09,066 --> 02:28:13,196
Then if you defeat Messala and the new governor there to see it...

1210
02:28:13,406 --> 02:28:16,346
...the news will scorch the streets of the Roman world.

1211
02:28:16,546 --> 02:28:17,596
Pontius Pilate here?

1212
02:28:17,806 --> 02:28:19,776
Yes, and ready to grind his heel into us.

1213
02:28:19,976 --> 02:28:23,376
You will make him see what men are born in this land.

1214
02:28:23,946 --> 02:28:27,386
I only know that I race against Messala.

1215
02:28:43,636 --> 02:28:45,106
Look for the yoke.

1216
02:28:47,406 --> 02:28:48,926
Ease that strap.

1217
02:29:29,986 --> 02:29:34,686
God forgive me for seeking vengeance, but my path is set.

1218
02:29:34,886 --> 02:29:39,416
Into Your hands I commit my life. Do with me as You will.

1219
02:29:54,806 --> 02:29:56,606
The Star of David.

1220
02:29:56,806 --> 02:29:59,936
To shine out for your people and my people together...

1221
02:30:00,146 --> 02:30:02,276
...and blind the eyes of Rome.

1222
02:30:05,216 --> 02:30:06,586
They are ready.

1223
02:30:34,646 --> 02:30:36,636
Easy, girl, easy.

1224
02:31:16,226 --> 02:31:17,916
Number five.

1225
02:31:18,956 --> 02:31:21,186
Where is number five?

1226
02:31:51,956 --> 02:31:55,896
This is the day, Judah. It's between us now.

1227
02:31:56,196 --> 02:31:59,566
Yes, this is the day.

1228
02:32:02,706 --> 02:32:05,796
Look, he's driving a Greek chariot.

1229
02:32:22,226 --> 02:32:25,816
Judah, be careful. Don't let him near you.

1230
02:32:37,466 --> 02:32:40,876
Hail, Jupiter. Give me victory.

1231
02:36:21,156 --> 02:36:23,786
Watch your line! Keep your places!

1232
02:36:48,116 --> 02:36:50,786
The formation is good. A beautiful line.

1233
02:37:12,376 --> 02:37:13,606
Citizens...

1234
02:37:14,546 --> 02:37:19,276
...I welcome you to these games in the name of your emperor, Tiberius.

1235
02:37:19,886 --> 02:37:22,546
We dedicate them to his glory...

1236
02:37:22,756 --> 02:37:25,276
...and to the glory of Rome...

1237
02:37:25,496 --> 02:37:28,156
...of which you are all part.

1238
02:37:31,466 --> 02:37:34,626
Let us honor those who race for us today.

1239
02:37:35,166 --> 02:37:37,726
They come here from Alexandria...

1240
02:37:37,936 --> 02:37:39,126
...Messina...

1241
02:37:39,406 --> 02:37:40,736
...Carthage...

1242
02:37:40,936 --> 02:37:42,166
...Cyprus...

1243
02:37:42,376 --> 02:37:43,566
...Rome...

1244
02:37:43,846 --> 02:37:45,006
...Corinth...

1245
02:37:45,306 --> 02:37:46,646
...Athens...

1246
02:37:46,846 --> 02:37:48,106
...Phrygia...

1247
02:37:48,316 --> 02:37:50,006
...and Judea.

1248
02:37:58,226 --> 02:38:01,456
To the best of these, a crown of victory.

1249
02:38:02,266 --> 02:38:04,356
The race begins.

1250
02:38:04,996 --> 02:38:07,226
Hail, Caesar!

1251
02:42:10,117 --> 02:42:12,176
Come, my children, come!

1252
02:42:29,269 --> 02:42:30,827
The Roman pig!

1253
02:49:03,230 --> 02:49:04,595
Salute.

1254
02:49:19,246 --> 02:49:21,009
A great victory.

1255
02:49:21,214 --> 02:49:23,808
You are the people's one true god...

1256
02:49:24,017 --> 02:49:25,678
...for the time being.

1257
02:49:26,253 --> 02:49:27,948
Permit us to worship.

1258
02:49:35,929 --> 02:49:38,397
I crown their god.

1259
02:49:58,385 --> 02:50:02,151
I will send for you. I have a message from Rome.

1260
02:50:02,822 --> 02:50:07,088
A long life, young Arrius and the good sense to live it.

1261
02:50:32,252 --> 02:50:34,482
We cannot wait, tribune.

1262
02:50:34,688 --> 02:50:37,020
He will come. He will--

1263
02:50:45,131 --> 02:50:47,224
We cannot wait any longer, tribune.

1264
02:50:47,434 --> 02:50:49,197
He will come!

1265
02:50:52,706 --> 02:50:54,196
He will come.

1266
02:50:54,908 --> 02:50:58,400
I've sent for him, and he will come.

1267
02:50:58,745 --> 02:51:03,011
If you wish us to keep you alive, we have to go to work now, tribune.

1268
02:51:03,750 --> 02:51:05,115
Do you understand?

1269
02:51:05,318 --> 02:51:07,377
To hack the legs off me?

1270
02:51:07,687 --> 02:51:11,350
Not yet. Not till I've seen him.

1271
02:51:11,992 --> 02:51:14,460
I don't receive him with half a body.

1272
02:51:28,241 --> 02:51:29,538
No!

1273
02:51:37,217 --> 02:51:40,243
I told you, Drusus. I told you.

1274
02:51:40,587 --> 02:51:42,248
Here he is.

1275
02:52:17,891 --> 02:52:20,416
Triumph complete, Judah.

1276
02:52:21,161 --> 02:52:24,187
The race won. The enemy destroyed.

1277
02:52:29,336 --> 02:52:31,429
I see no enemy.

1278
02:52:33,006 --> 02:52:34,871
What do you think you see?

1279
02:52:35,075 --> 02:52:38,010
The smashed body of a wretched animal?

1280
02:52:40,680 --> 02:52:44,411
There's enough of a man still left here for you to hate.

1281
02:52:49,622 --> 02:52:51,453
Let me help you.

1282
02:53:05,972 --> 02:53:09,305
You think they're dead, your mother and sister.

1283
02:53:10,143 --> 02:53:12,941
Dead. And the race over.

1284
02:53:15,215 --> 02:53:17,513
It isn't over, Judah.

1285
02:53:18,385 --> 02:53:19,579
They're not dead.

1286
02:53:25,291 --> 02:53:27,088
Where are they?

1287
02:53:38,638 --> 02:53:40,128
Where are they?

1288
02:53:43,977 --> 02:53:45,501
Where are they?!

1289
02:53:49,349 --> 02:53:51,010
Look for them...

1290
02:53:51,351 --> 02:53:55,014
...in the Valley of the Lepers...

1291
02:53:57,023 --> 02:53:59,753
...if you can recognize them.

1292
02:54:14,908 --> 02:54:16,603
It goes on.

1293
02:54:18,044 --> 02:54:20,103
It goes on, Judah.

1294
02:54:22,282 --> 02:54:23,749
The race....

1295
02:54:26,152 --> 02:54:30,555
The race is not over.

1296
02:56:21,699 --> 02:56:23,564
ls there a way down here?

1297
02:56:23,934 --> 02:56:27,028
Are you a madman? Keep well out of this place.

1298
02:57:16,020 --> 02:57:17,180
Man.

1299
02:57:22,192 --> 02:57:25,958
I'm searching for two women, a mother and daughter.

1300
02:57:29,667 --> 02:57:31,726
There are many women.

1301
02:57:33,337 --> 02:57:35,737
Of the family of Hur.

1302
02:57:37,675 --> 02:57:39,939
We have no names here.

1303
02:58:39,436 --> 02:58:40,425
For them?

1304
02:58:45,776 --> 02:58:48,677
-Why did you say they were dead? -It was what they wanted.

1305
02:58:48,879 --> 02:58:53,009
You must not betray this faith. Would you do this for them?

1306
02:58:53,317 --> 02:58:55,046
Not to see them?

1307
02:58:55,319 --> 02:58:56,445
They are coming.

1308
02:58:56,653 --> 02:59:01,420
Love them in the way they must need to be loved. Not to look at them.

1309
02:59:01,625 --> 02:59:04,321
Let them be as if you had never come here. Please! Judah.

1310
03:00:18,669 --> 03:00:20,000
ls Judah well?

1311
03:00:21,371 --> 03:00:23,396
ls he happy?

1312
03:00:24,608 --> 03:00:27,600
Yes, he is well.

1313
03:00:30,881 --> 03:00:33,509
Your mind can be at rest for him.

1314
03:00:34,151 --> 03:00:35,846
He is well, Miriam.

1315
03:00:45,762 --> 03:00:47,286
God be with you.

1316
03:01:23,700 --> 03:01:25,133
They have gone.

1317
03:01:32,042 --> 03:01:33,600
We can go back.

1318
03:01:38,048 --> 03:01:40,812
Go back to what?

1319
03:01:43,186 --> 03:01:45,746
Judah, they have one blessing left.

1320
03:01:46,123 --> 03:01:49,320
To think you remember them as they were...

1321
03:01:50,661 --> 03:01:52,652
...and live your own life.

1322
03:01:55,432 --> 03:01:57,161
Forget what is here.

1323
03:01:57,367 --> 03:01:58,595
Forget?

1324
03:02:01,538 --> 03:02:03,301
It's as though they're alive in a grave.

1325
03:02:03,507 --> 03:02:06,203
-But what can you do? -Undo what you've done.

1326
03:02:06,410 --> 03:02:09,868
How could you have suffered them to come here? I must see them.

1327
03:02:10,080 --> 03:02:12,640
No, Judah, please! Judah!

1328
03:02:16,954 --> 03:02:21,357
Think, Judah, think. It would tear them apart if they see you.

1329
03:03:25,360 --> 03:03:29,062
Judah, Judah.

1330
03:03:29,860 --> 03:03:33,762
He is here. I have found Him. The child has become a man.

1331
03:03:34,031 --> 03:03:38,229
And the man, I know it now, is the Son of God.

1332
03:03:42,406 --> 03:03:44,169
The promise is true.

1333
03:03:45,475 --> 03:03:49,241
Happy Balthasar. Life has answered you.

1334
03:03:49,446 --> 03:03:51,539
Life has been answered.

1335
03:03:51,815 --> 03:03:53,646
God has answered it.

1336
03:04:08,765 --> 03:04:10,756
Come. Come with me.

1337
03:04:14,104 --> 03:04:16,572
When the Romans were marching me to the galleys...

1338
03:04:16,773 --> 03:04:18,832
...thirst had nearly killed me.

1339
03:04:19,042 --> 03:04:21,772
A man gave me water to drink.

1340
03:04:22,045 --> 03:04:23,740
I went on living.

1341
03:04:24,147 --> 03:04:27,548
I should have done better if I had poured it into the sand.

1342
03:04:27,751 --> 03:04:28,615
No.

1343
03:04:29,586 --> 03:04:31,076
I am thirsty still.

1344
03:04:31,855 --> 03:04:33,686
Come and listen.

1345
03:04:35,692 --> 03:04:37,683
I have business with Rome.

1346
03:04:39,529 --> 03:04:41,554
You insist on death.

1347
03:04:46,803 --> 03:04:48,361
Goodbye, Judah.

1348
03:06:41,618 --> 03:06:42,607
You sent for me?

1349
03:06:42,819 --> 03:06:45,811
I hope I bring you a good conclusion to your victory.

1350
03:06:46,022 --> 03:06:49,185
I have a message for you from the consul, your father.

1351
03:06:51,294 --> 03:06:54,388
-I honor him. -As you may honor yourself.

1352
03:06:54,598 --> 03:06:56,896
You have been made a citizen of Rome.

1353
03:07:00,770 --> 03:07:02,863
Do you say nothing to this?

1354
03:07:05,675 --> 03:07:09,042
I have just come from the Valley of Stone...

1355
03:07:09,246 --> 03:07:13,114
...where my mother and sister live what's left of their lives.

1356
03:07:13,316 --> 03:07:18,185
By Rome's will, lepers, outcasts without hope.

1357
03:07:18,455 --> 03:07:22,789
I have heard this. There was great blame there, very deeply regretted.

1358
03:07:22,993 --> 03:07:27,692
Their flesh is mine, Lord Pilate. It already carries Rome's mark.

1359
03:07:27,898 --> 03:07:30,526
Messala is dead. What he did has had its way with him.

1360
03:07:30,734 --> 03:07:34,192
The deed was not Messala's. I knew him, well.

1361
03:07:34,404 --> 03:07:37,305
Before the cruelty of Rome spread in his blood.

1362
03:07:37,507 --> 03:07:41,944
Rome destroyed Messala as surely as Rome has destroyed my family.

1363
03:07:42,145 --> 03:07:46,377
Where there is greatness, great government or power...

1364
03:07:46,583 --> 03:07:48,881
...even great feeling or compassion...

1365
03:07:49,085 --> 03:07:51,610
...error also is great.

1366
03:07:51,821 --> 03:07:53,914
We progress and mature by fault.

1367
03:07:54,124 --> 03:07:57,719
Rome has said she is ready to join your life to hers in a great future.

1368
03:07:58,061 --> 03:07:59,494
There are other voices.

1369
03:07:59,696 --> 03:08:03,257
The voice, for instance, of Arrius waiting for you in Rome.

1370
03:08:03,466 --> 03:08:05,900
He would tell you, if I may speak in his place...

1371
03:08:06,469 --> 03:08:09,632
...not to crucify yourself on a shadow such as old resentment...

1372
03:08:09,839 --> 03:08:11,966
...or impossible loyalties.

1373
03:08:12,175 --> 03:08:14,507
Perfect freedom has no existence.

1374
03:08:14,711 --> 03:08:17,646
A grown man knows the world he lives in.

1375
03:08:17,847 --> 03:08:21,283
And for the present, the world is Rome.

1376
03:08:22,352 --> 03:08:24,684
Young Arrius, I am sure, will choose it.

1377
03:08:26,823 --> 03:08:28,723
I am Judah Ben-Hur.

1378
03:08:40,870 --> 03:08:43,464
I cross this floor in spoken friendship...

1379
03:08:43,673 --> 03:08:45,868
...as I would speak to Arrius.

1380
03:08:46,309 --> 03:08:50,006
But when I go up those stairs, I become the hand of Caesar...

1381
03:08:50,213 --> 03:08:52,738
...ready to crush those who challenge his authority.

1382
03:08:53,550 --> 03:08:55,711
There are too many men of envy and ambition...

1383
03:08:55,919 --> 03:08:58,149
...who try to disrupt the government of Rome.

1384
03:08:58,355 --> 03:09:00,915
You have become the victor and hero to those people.

1385
03:09:01,491 --> 03:09:05,621
They look to you, their one true god, as I call you.

1386
03:09:06,096 --> 03:09:10,055
If you stay here, you will find yourself part of this tragedy.

1387
03:09:11,034 --> 03:09:14,026
I am already part of this tragedy.

1388
03:09:20,477 --> 03:09:22,570
Return this to Arrius.

1389
03:09:24,080 --> 03:09:26,640
I honor him too well to wear it any longer.

1390
03:09:36,393 --> 03:09:38,588
Even for Arrius' sake, I cannot protect you...

1391
03:09:38,795 --> 03:09:41,457
...from personal disaster if you stay here.

1392
03:09:42,298 --> 03:09:44,323
You are too great a danger.

1393
03:10:00,150 --> 03:10:01,947
Leave Judea.

1394
03:10:03,787 --> 03:10:05,652
You have my word.

1395
03:10:27,123 --> 03:10:28,757
Judah.

1396
03:10:37,423 --> 03:10:39,357
Oh,Judah.

1397
03:10:39,923 --> 03:10:42,357
I was afraid you would never come back...

1398
03:10:42,559 --> 03:10:44,857
...afraid of what would happen to you.

1399
03:10:46,596 --> 03:10:48,587
But I see you again.

1400
03:10:51,101 --> 03:10:53,626
Your father's waiting for me.

1401
03:10:57,941 --> 03:10:59,203
Where is he?

1402
03:11:02,011 --> 03:11:03,308
What do you mean to do?

1403
03:11:11,811 --> 03:11:13,308
Judah.

1404
03:11:14,557 --> 03:11:16,787
Rest, sleep.

1405
03:11:16,993 --> 03:11:20,326
For a few hours of the night let your mind be at peace.

1406
03:11:20,530 --> 03:11:21,792
Peace?

1407
03:11:22,031 --> 03:11:24,022
Love and peace.

1408
03:11:24,234 --> 03:11:27,203
Do you think I don't long for them as much as you do?

1409
03:11:27,537 --> 03:11:28,697
Where do you see them?

1410
03:11:30,206 --> 03:11:32,265
If you had heard this man from Nazareth.

1411
03:11:32,475 --> 03:11:33,772
Balthasar's word.

1412
03:11:35,678 --> 03:11:38,238
He is more than Balthasar's word.

1413
03:11:38,748 --> 03:11:42,741
His voiced traveled with such a still purpose.

1414
03:11:43,153 --> 03:11:45,246
It was more than a voice.

1415
03:11:46,122 --> 03:11:48,386
A man more than a man.

1416
03:11:52,061 --> 03:11:56,088
He said, "Blessed are the merciful...

1417
03:11:56,299 --> 03:11:58,563
...for they shall obtain mercy.

1418
03:11:59,435 --> 03:12:01,767
Blessed are the peacemakers...

1419
03:12:01,971 --> 03:12:05,099
...for they shall be called the children of God."

1420
03:12:05,675 --> 03:12:06,937
Children of God?

1421
03:12:07,944 --> 03:12:10,777
ln that dead valley where we left them?

1422
03:12:11,047 --> 03:12:14,813
I tell you every man of Judea is unclean and will stay unclean...

1423
03:12:15,018 --> 03:12:18,249
...until we have scoured off our bodies the crust and filth...

1424
03:12:18,454 --> 03:12:20,649
...of being at the mercy of tyranny.

1425
03:12:21,124 --> 03:12:24,651
No other life is possible except to wash this land clean.

1426
03:12:24,861 --> 03:12:26,624
-ln blood?  -Yes, in blood!

1427
03:12:28,831 --> 03:12:30,696
I know there is a law in life.

1428
03:12:30,900 --> 03:12:34,836
That blood begets more blood as dog begets dog.

1429
03:12:35,138 --> 03:12:37,231
Death generates death...

1430
03:12:37,440 --> 03:12:40,000
...as the vulture breeds the vulture.

1431
03:12:40,810 --> 03:12:43,335
But the voice I heard today on the hill said:

1432
03:12:43,546 --> 03:12:45,275
"Love your enemy.

1433
03:12:45,615 --> 03:12:48,778
Do good to those who despitefully use you."

1434
03:12:49,485 --> 03:12:53,046
All who are born in this land hereafter can suffer as we have done.

1435
03:12:53,256 --> 03:12:55,520
As you make us do now.

1436
03:12:59,195 --> 03:13:01,561
Are we to bear nothing together?

1437
03:13:03,366 --> 03:13:04,697
Even love?

1438
03:13:08,404 --> 03:13:10,998
I can hardly draw breath...

1439
03:13:11,374 --> 03:13:13,638
...without feeling you in my heart.

1440
03:13:14,911 --> 03:13:16,401
But I know...

1441
03:13:18,147 --> 03:13:20,581
...that everything I do from this moment...

1442
03:13:20,783 --> 03:13:23,911
...bears greater pain than you have ever suffered.

1443
03:13:25,355 --> 03:13:27,516
It is better not to love me.

1444
03:13:29,125 --> 03:13:33,619
It was Judah Ben-Hur I loved. What has become of him?

1445
03:13:34,097 --> 03:13:37,066
You seem to be now the very thing you set out to destroy...

1446
03:13:37,267 --> 03:13:41,761
...giving evil for evil. Hatred is turning you to stone.

1447
03:13:41,971 --> 03:13:43,871
It's as though you had become Messala.

1448
03:13:52,582 --> 03:13:54,675
I've lost you, Judah.

1449
03:14:57,280 --> 03:14:58,975
No further.

1450
03:14:59,982 --> 03:15:01,313
What are you doing here?

1451
03:15:02,051 --> 03:15:04,611
I was here last evening waiting for you.

1452
03:15:04,821 --> 03:15:07,289
I have waited all night. What has happened?

1453
03:15:08,157 --> 03:15:09,647
Where is Tirzah?

1454
03:15:12,862 --> 03:15:14,659
Leave the food.

1455
03:15:15,798 --> 03:15:18,528
I am coming closer. Don't be afraid.

1456
03:15:18,735 --> 03:15:21,101
-What are you doing? -Don't be afraid.

1457
03:15:21,537 --> 03:15:24,165
I've heard Him again, the man from Nazareth.

1458
03:15:24,374 --> 03:15:28,777
If ever words were from God, they are in everything He says.

1459
03:15:28,978 --> 03:15:32,072
I cannot bear that you should have never known...

1460
03:15:32,281 --> 03:15:36,149
...this hand of quiet reaching towards us.

1461
03:15:36,586 --> 03:15:39,612
He is going to Jerusalem. We can find Him there.

1462
03:15:39,822 --> 03:15:42,256
Bring Tirzah and we can go together to find Him.

1463
03:15:45,128 --> 03:15:47,358
Tirzah is dying.

1464
03:15:53,803 --> 03:15:56,294
Leave the food and go.

1465
03:15:58,541 --> 03:16:00,168
It's Judah.

1466
03:16:04,380 --> 03:16:06,541
Why did you tell him?

1467
03:16:07,350 --> 03:16:09,284
Yes, Judah, yes.

1468
03:16:09,886 --> 03:16:13,117
No nearer, please, God, no nearer.

1469
03:16:13,322 --> 03:16:14,346
Mother.

1470
03:16:17,293 --> 03:16:20,194
Wait, Mother, wait.

1471
03:16:20,396 --> 03:16:21,556
Let me talk with you.

1472
03:16:21,764 --> 03:16:23,197
Please.

1473
03:16:23,399 --> 03:16:25,993
No, no further. Please.

1474
03:16:26,202 --> 03:16:29,899
No, Judah. Son, no.

1475
03:16:30,673 --> 03:16:33,642
Mother, let me see Tirzah.

1476
03:16:33,843 --> 03:16:34,832
Tirzah is dying.

1477
03:16:45,555 --> 03:16:48,786
Judah, if they would see Jesus of Nazareth they will know...

1478
03:16:48,991 --> 03:16:50,982
...that life is everlasting...

1479
03:16:51,194 --> 03:16:54,857
...and death is nothing to fear if you have faith.

1480
03:16:57,467 --> 03:16:59,094
I will take them to Him.

1481
03:17:01,204 --> 03:17:02,330
No!

1482
03:17:03,139 --> 03:17:04,731
God, no!

1483
03:17:18,454 --> 03:17:21,423
No, no, dear son.

1484
03:17:22,458 --> 03:17:23,618
Mother...

1485
03:17:26,429 --> 03:17:27,953
...where is Tirzah?

1486
03:17:31,133 --> 03:17:32,122
Judah, no.

1487
03:17:33,803 --> 03:17:35,600
Judah, no.

1488
03:17:44,380 --> 03:17:47,247
You must not go to her, dear son.

1489
03:17:48,584 --> 03:17:49,881
Please.

1490
03:17:50,486 --> 03:17:52,010
Dear son.

1491
03:18:43,272 --> 03:18:44,899
I am afraid.

1492
03:18:45,908 --> 03:18:47,535
No cause.

1493
03:18:49,011 --> 03:18:51,445
The world is more than we know.

1494
03:19:27,650 --> 03:19:30,778
Tirzah, it's Judah.

1495
03:19:33,389 --> 03:19:35,186
No, Judah.

1496
03:20:18,834 --> 03:20:21,496
Alms for the blind

1497
03:20:22,571 --> 03:20:25,165
Alms for the blind

1498
03:20:28,310 --> 03:20:31,006
Alms for the blind

1499
03:20:32,882 --> 03:20:37,148
-Why are the streets deserted? -They have gone to the trial.

1500
03:20:37,386 --> 03:20:39,752
Trial? Whose trial?

1501
03:20:39,955 --> 03:20:43,288
The young rabbi from Nazareth. They are wanting his death.

1502
03:20:43,492 --> 03:20:45,619
-This cannot be true. -Alms?

1503
03:20:47,063 --> 03:20:48,428
What has he done?

1504
03:20:48,631 --> 03:20:52,362
Nothing I know of. For the blind, for the blind.

1505
03:20:52,568 --> 03:20:54,468
Help for the blind.

1506
03:20:54,670 --> 03:20:56,865
-Look, lepers!   -Lepers!

1507
03:20:58,274 --> 03:21:00,936
Get away! Stay away!

1508
03:21:02,278 --> 03:21:03,540
Go away!

1509
03:23:22,985 --> 03:23:25,112
Lepers! Lepers!

1510
03:23:46,675 --> 03:23:48,836
How can this be?

1511
03:23:57,953 --> 03:24:00,319
I know this man.

1512
03:24:14,436 --> 03:24:16,336
Will someone help Him?

1513
03:24:23,812 --> 03:24:25,143
Take pity on Him.

1514
03:24:32,554 --> 03:24:34,385
Have mercy.

1515
03:24:56,545 --> 03:24:58,445
ln His pain...

1516
03:24:59,148 --> 03:25:01,480
...this look of peace.

1517
03:25:03,552 --> 03:25:05,452
Watch over them, Esther.

1518
03:25:43,492 --> 03:25:44,823
We must go back.

1519
03:25:45,027 --> 03:25:47,359
I brought you here to this...

1520
03:25:48,097 --> 03:25:49,792
...when I hoped....

1521
03:25:52,668 --> 03:25:55,068
You haven't failed, Esther.

1522
03:26:13,622 --> 03:26:16,250
Hail King of the Jews!

1523
03:28:54,283 --> 03:28:57,810
This is where your search has brought you, Balthasar.

1524
03:29:04,593 --> 03:29:06,390
He gave me water...

1525
03:29:07,196 --> 03:29:09,221
...and a heart to live.

1526
03:29:12,167 --> 03:29:14,032
What has He done to merit this?

1527
03:29:16,271 --> 03:29:20,002
He has taken the world of our sins onto Himself.

1528
03:29:21,210 --> 03:29:24,111
To this end He said He was born...

1529
03:29:25,380 --> 03:29:27,280
...in that stable...

1530
03:29:28,016 --> 03:29:30,143
...where I first saw Him.

1531
03:29:33,722 --> 03:29:37,123
For this cause, He came into the world.

1532
03:29:43,865 --> 03:29:45,628
For this death?

1533
03:29:48,370 --> 03:29:49,894
This beginning.

1534
03:30:22,437 --> 03:30:24,530
I have lived too long.

1535
03:30:55,637 --> 03:30:58,731
As though He were carrying in that cross...

1536
03:30:58,940 --> 03:31:01,101
...the pain of the world.

1537
03:31:02,577 --> 03:31:07,139
So fearful, and yet why is it...

1538
03:31:07,349 --> 03:31:09,613
...I'm not afraid anymore?

1539
03:31:18,894 --> 03:31:21,226
The shadow of a storm.

1540
03:31:46,855 --> 03:31:49,085
A strange darkness...

1541
03:31:49,291 --> 03:31:51,259
...but still day.

1542
03:32:00,268 --> 03:32:02,463
His life is over.

1543
03:32:23,725 --> 03:32:25,022
What is it?

1544
03:32:34,102 --> 03:32:35,763
This tearing.

1545
03:32:36,671 --> 03:32:38,536
I am in pain.

1546
03:32:39,474 --> 03:32:41,533
I feel it too.

1547
03:33:26,354 --> 03:33:28,219
Do you see your hand?

1548
03:36:06,615 --> 03:36:09,140
Almost at the moment He died...

1549
03:36:10,619 --> 03:36:14,111
...I heard Him say, "Father, forgive them...

1550
03:36:14,322 --> 03:36:16,688
...for they know not what they do."

1551
03:36:18,893 --> 03:36:20,417
Even then.

1552
03:36:20,695 --> 03:36:22,128
Even then.

1553
03:36:27,836 --> 03:36:32,296
And I felt His voice take the sword out of my hand.

1554
03:37:51,253 --> 03:38:02,192
