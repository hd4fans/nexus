Sneak a nigga when he ain't looking. That's some bitch shit.

349
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:29,845
在我们国家
Where I come from...

350
00:41:30,012 --> 00:41:33,432
没有人整天废话
...people don't talk unless they have something to say.

351
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:35,726
我是说
Yeah, well....

352
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:38,604
如果你靠这招获胜
Just saying if that's how you gotta win...

353
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:42,233
或许你不该来这里
...maybe you shouldn't be here.

354

357
00:42:14,181 --> 00:42:15,641
俄国人
Russia?

358
00:42:16,851 --> 00:42:18,060
我要大便
I need to take a shit.

359
00:42:21,063 --> 00:42:24,442
我要大便 却找不到大便的地方
Say, man, I need to take a shit, and I can't find no place to do it.

360

366
00:43:06,525 --> 00:43:08,361
什么东西

367
00:43:11,572 --> 00:43:13,115
俄国人
Russia?

368
00:43:14,283 --> 00:43:16,994
俄国人 有东西在我的牢房里爬
Russia, they've got fucking things moving in my cell, man.

369
00:43:17,203 --> 00:43:18,871
俄国人 又怎么了
- Russia? - What?

370
00:43:21,624 --> 00:43:23,417
你叫什么名字
What's your name, man?

371
00:43:23,876 --> 00:43:24,877
我真的问你
Seriously.

372
00:43:25,044 --> 00:43:26,212
你就闭嘴吧
Just be quiet.

373
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,882
连名字都不告诉我
You can't fucking tell me your name, man'

377
00:43:37,223 --> 00:43:40,685

383
00:44:06,794 --> 00:44:09,255
我们不能等 现在就要见我们的格斗士
We're not gonna wait. We're gonna see our clients now.

384
00:44:09,422 --> 00:44:11,340
格格 行了
Gaga, please.

385
00:44:14,302 --> 00:44:15,970
请帮个忙
See what you could do.

386
00:44:17,847 --> 00:44:20,016
让我想起了从前
Brings back memories.

387
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:32,278
那天打得不错 你还好吗
It was a good fight the other day. How are you?

388
00:44:32,778 --> 00:44:34,155

389
00:44:35,531 --> 00:44:36,615
对 你还好吗
Yes, how are you?

390
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:39,702
你陷害了我？
Did you set me up?

391
00:44:41,329 --> 00:44:42,496
怎么说这话？
What's going on?

392
00:44:43,122 --> 00:44:45,291
这是什么狗屁比赛
What sort of fucking tournament is this?

393
00:44:45,458 --> 00:44:47,626
博伊卡有话直说怎么了
Boyka, cut to the chase. What's going on?

394
00:44:47,793 --> 00:44:50,004
我们被强迫做苦工
We're being forced to do hard labor.

395
00:44:50,671 --> 00:44:53,633
做苦工你胡说什么
Hard labor? What the fuck are you talking about?

396
00:44:53,799 --> 00:44:56,177
让我们拿着锤子砸石头
I'm talking about I'm breaking rocks with a hammer.

397
00:44:56,344 --> 00:44:57,762
还用链子相互拴起来
Some fucking chain-gang shit.

398
00:44:58,804 --> 00:45:00,640
混蛋
Son of a bitch.

399
00:45:00,806 --> 00:45:03,142
是啊 你能不能想想办法
Yeah. You gonna do something about it?

400
00:45:03,309 --> 00:45:05,144
没问题
Consider it done.

401
00:45:05,353 --> 00:45:08,648
骗人的混蛋
Lying cocksuckers.

402
00:45:12,193 --> 00:45:16,697
我发誓 我今天一定要揍他一顿
I swear to Christ, I'm gonna fucking clip somebody before this day is over.

403
00:45:26,415 --> 00:45:28,417
两位 你这混蛋
Gentlemen. - You cocksucker.

404
00:45:28,584 --> 00:45:31,420
你这是干什么 想必你们都认识瑞佐先生
- What the fuck are you doing? - Of course you know Mr. Rezo.

405
00:45:34,423 --> 00:45:36,008
我的朋友
My friends.

406
00:45:36,175 --> 00:45:37,510
你们似乎很激动
You seem agitated.

407
00:45:37,677 --> 00:45:40,388
激动？为什么让我的格斗士做苦工
Agitated? Why is my fighter doing hard labor?

408
00:45:40,554 --> 00:45:43,015
当然是因为你希望他输
Because you want him to lose, of course.

409
00:45:43,182 --> 00:45:44,976
你以为呢
What did you expect?

410
00:45:45,184 --> 00:45:47,728
你们真的以为
Did you really think...

411
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:53,943
我不会按照自己的方式来安排吗
...that I would not arrange for things to go my way?

412
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:57,530
你这混蛋 你知道为了让我的格斗士到这里 我花了多少钱吗
You motherfucker, you know how much cash I dropped to get my fighter here?

413
00:45:57,697 --> 00:45:58,864
我当然知道
Of course I do.

414
00:45:59,031 --> 00:46:00,408
我要整死你
I will fucking destroy you.

415
00:46:00,574 --> 00:46:02,535
有可能
Okay, perhaps.

416
00:46:02,702 --> 00:46:06,122
或者还有另一条路可以走
Or maybe there is another way we can go.

417
00:46:06,539 --> 00:46:09,250
记得我在宴会上说的话吗
Remember what I said at the dinner?

418
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:14,255
我们怎样以最低的风险确保最高的利润
How do we ensure the greatest profit at the lowest risk?

419
00:46:15,256 --> 00:46:17,717
因此我的建议如下
So my suggestion is this:

420
00:46:18,134 --> 00:46:22,263
拿出你们所有的钱
Go under your mattresses, find all the money you can...

421
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:27,560
变卖所有财产 都押在哥伦比亚人身上

...liquefy everything and put it all on the Colombian.

422
00:46:28,311 --> 00:46:34,066
这样 你们走的时候就能腰缠万贯了
Do this and you will leave here richer men than ever you could've dreamed.

423
00:46:35,067 --> 00:46:37,194
不是还有我们的格斗士吗 别管他们了
- What about our fighters? - Fuck your fighters.

424
00:46:38,404 --> 00:46:39,488
不管他们了？
Fuck our fighters?

425
00:46:39,655 --> 00:46:41,657
他们都没有希望
They're the weak horses.

426
00:46:41,824 --> 00:46:43,909
我们会摆平他们
We put them down with the rest.

427
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:49,498
你们能保证我的格斗士不会赢吗
Can you guarantee that my fighter doesn't win?

428
00:46:49,915 --> 00:46:55,504
这一点我完全能保证
This I absolutely guarantee.

429
00:47:12,104 --> 00:47:13,981
喂 你不要再拉了
Hey. Would you stop pulling?

430
00:47:14,148 --> 00:47:16,442
我没有拉
I'm not pulling.

431
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:19,028
你有
Yes, you are.

432
00:47:21,322 --> 00:47:23,616
看见我走就跟着我走
You see me move, you move with me.

433
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:27,244
我又不是你肚子里的蛔虫
I ain't Ginger Rogers, and your ass ain't Fred Astaire.

434
00:47:27,453 --> 00:47:30,498
告诉我一声 我才好跟着你走
Give me a warning, and I'll move with you.

435
00:47:32,208 --> 00:47:33,250
好 好
- Okay. - Okay.

436
00:47:33,459 --> 00:47:35,127
我现在要走了
I'm going to move now.

437
00:47:38,172 --> 00:47:39,674
你觉得这好玩吗
That's funny, huh?

438
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,385
你还想来了？还想被关在洞里
Wanna do this again? End up in the motherfucking hole?

439
00:47:42,551 --> 00:47:44,095
你希望这样吗
Is that what you want?

440
00:47:44,303 --> 00:47:45,888
是的

Sure, it is.

441
00:47:46,055 --> 00:47:47,098
告诉你
So I'll tell you what.

442
00:47:47,306 --> 00:47:49,350
我很乐意揍你一顿
I want nothing more but to get into your ass.

443
00:47:49,517 --> 00:47:52,228
但是在赛场上打才算数 明白吗
But we're gonna do it in a ring where it matters. Got it?

444
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,898
好啊 好
- Fine. - Fine.

445
00:47:56,065 --> 00:47:58,192
数到三下
Uh... On three.

446
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:00,611
一 二 三
One, two, three.

447
00:48:07,493 --> 00:48:08,995
对了
You know what?

448
00:48:09,161 --> 00:48:10,496
那个哥伦比亚混蛋呢
Where is that Colombian motherfucker anyway?

449
00:48:10,496 --> 00:48:12,248
那个哥伦比亚混蛋呢
Where is that Colombian motherfucker anyway?

450
00:48:51,162 --> 00:48:52,872
谢谢
Thanks.

451
00:48:55,374 --> 00:48:59,045
他们为什么整你
So, what did they clip you for?

452
00:48:59,211 --> 00:49:01,005
什么 再来些面包
What? More bread.

453
00:49:01,589 --> 00:49:04,050
你犯了什么事 判了什么刑
What'd they pop you for? What's your sentence?

454
00:49:05,593 --> 00:49:07,428
别说些听不懂的
I speak English.

455
00:49:07,595 --> 00:49:09,138
好不好
Do you?

456
00:49:09,764 --> 00:49:15,061
我只是问你怎么进来的
I was just asking what are you actually in this motherfucker for?

457
00:49:15,561 --> 00:49:17,605
因为犯了罪
Committed crime.

458
00:49:19,398 --> 00:49:20,733
你不想聊
You don't wanna talk?

459
00:49:20,941 --> 00:49:22,109
那就不聊
Fine, we ain't gotta talk.

460
00:49:22,276 --> 00:49:25,279
反正聊天也没意思 我不健谈
- Talking's bullshit anyway. - It's not my strength.

461
00:49:25,905 --> 00:49:27,573
是嘛
No shit.

462
00:49:38,918 --> 00:49:40,836
你知道这是怎么回事吧
You know what's going on, right?

463
00:49:41,003 --> 00:49:42,213
什么
What?

464
00:49:42,421 --> 00:49:44,632
这事早就内定下来了
This shit's fixed.

465
00:49:45,424 --> 00:49:46,550
什么事
What shit?

466
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:49,387
这件事 比赛的事
This shit. This fucking tournament.

467
00:49:49,553 --> 00:49:53,057
我们早就被人算计好了
And what's worse is we was fixed in this fixed motherfucker.

468
00:49:53,265 --> 00:49:56,435
因此那个哥伦比亚人在牢房里喝着酒
That why the fucking Colombian's in a cell sipping on pina coladas...

469
00:49:56,602 --> 00:49:58,229
而我们在这里累死累活
...while we're busting our asses.

470
00:49:58,396 --> 00:49:59,730
当然
Of course.

471
00:50:00,272 --> 00:50:01,691
你为什么这么说
What do you mean of course?

472
00:50:01,857 --> 00:50:03,985
难道你觉得意外？
This is surprise to you?

473
00:50:04,151 --> 00:50:06,028
我是奔着冠军来的
I came here to win.

474
00:50:06,195 --> 00:50:07,655
我也是
So did I.

475
00:50:09,907 --> 00:50:12,535
那么你不觉得气愤吗
So this don't piss you off at all?

476
00:50:15,663 --> 00:50:18,249
冠军需要很多条件
Winning takes many things.

477
00:50:18,457 --> 00:50:20,668
能打固然重要
Who can be the best fighter, yes, of course.

478
00:50:20,835 --> 00:50:23,129
但最重要的是
But most important...

479
00:50:26,299 --> 00:50:28,509
能活下来
...who can survive.

480
00:50:31,304 --> 00:50:32,638
什么意思
Survive what?

481
00:50:38,144 --> 00:50:40,479
在这里 你的对手
In here, the people you fight...

482
00:50:40,646 --> 00:50:43,107
不只是赛场上的
...they are not just in the ring.

483
00:50:51,157 --> 00:50:52,992
喂 过来
Hey, come here.

484
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:54,535
钥匙
The key.

485
00:51:07,673 --> 00:51:09,300
我们可以训练了吗
We can train?

486
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:15,890
一个小时
One hour.

487
00:51:18,351 --> 00:51:20,394
你疯了吗
Are you fucking crazy?

488
00:51:21,395 --> 00:51:23,147
算了吧
Fuck that.

489
00:51:23,522 --> 00:51:26,651
累得走路都走不动了
I can barely fucking walk. Working out...

490
00:51:41,916 --> 00:51:43,542
你就这两下子
Is that all you got?

491
00:51:50,466 --> 00:51:52,677
看我的
I'll give you a little test.

492
00:52:00,977 --> 00:52:02,061

卢卡 听我说
Luka, listen to me.

493
00:52:02,228 --> 00:52:03,813
取出所有的款项
I need you to liquefy the fund.

494
00:52:04,021 --> 00:52:04,897
是的 所有的
Yes, all of it.

495
00:52:04,897 --> 00:52:05,022
是的 所有的
Yes, all of it.

496
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:08,275
不行 明天以前
No, no, no. By tomorrow.

497
00:52:08,442 --> 00:52:11,779
我不管你有什么困难
I... I don't give a flying fuck how.

498
00:52:11,946 --> 00:52:13,781
实在不行就派鸽子
Send a pigeon if you have to, okay?

499
00:52:14,573 --> 00:52:16,742
我知道 维托 我知道你是我的担保人
I know, Vito. I know you vouched for me, Vito.

500
00:52:16,909 --> 00:52:20,371
像昨天一样 再给我100万美元
But look, I need another million like yesterday.

501
00:52:20,538 --> 00:52:22,415
维托 这是十拿九稳的
Vito, this is a sure thing. It's a lock.

502
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:27,712
对
Yeah.

503
00:52:34,427 --> 00:52:35,886
哇
Well, well, well.

504
00:52:36,053 --> 00:52:37,471
看看谁来了
Look who's here.

505
00:52:39,932 --> 00:52:42,143
他到这里干什么
What the fuck is he doing here?

506
00:52:46,605 --> 00:52:48,649
早餐结束了
Breakfast is over.

507
00:52:53,612 --> 00:52:56,115
这真是胡闹
This is some fucking bullshit.

508
00:52:56,282 --> 00:52:57,742
真是荒唐
It's a fucking joke.

509
00:52:57,950 --> 00:53:00,286
我这样怎么打？饭都不让吃
I'm suppose to fight like this. They starving me out...

510
00:53:00,453 --> 00:53:01,871
你说的太多了 去你的吧
- You curse too much. - Fuck you.

511
00:53:02,038 --> 00:53:03,289
你可以弃权
Then quit.

512
00:53:03,456 --> 00:53:05,833
从哪儿来 回哪儿去
Go back where you fucking came from.

513
00:53:07,168 --> 00:53:09,170
或者我们可以扭转局面
Maybe we can turn this around.

514
00:53:11,547 --> 00:53:15,009
你什么意思 我们可以让局面对我们有利
- What the fuck does that mean? - We can turn it to our advantage.

515
00:53:17,303 --> 00:53:18,429

怎么扭转
How?

520
00:53:25,978 --> 00:53:28,481
我们可以把做工
We can say this is work.

521
00:53:29,023 --> 00:53:31,359
当成是训练
Or we can say this is training.

528
00:54:28,082 --> 00:54:29,208
不要紧
I'm fine.

529
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:32,003
你不用硬撑 我说了不要紧
- You don't act like you're fine. - I said I'm fine.

530
00:54:48,602 --> 00:54:51,689
把它搓碎 然后抹在你的膝盖上
Squeeze that in your hand. Take the oil and rub it on your knee.

531
00:54:53,899 --> 00:54:55,359

没有
No.

548
00:55:58,464 --> 00:56:01,008
不想要个儿子吗 你问的太多了
- Never wanted a son... - You ask too many questions.

549
00:56:06,472 --> 00:56:08,724
你就是为此来比赛？
This is why you want to win?

550
00:56:09,141 --> 00:56:10,685
为了孩子
Children?

我坐牢很长时间了
I've been locked up for a long time.

552
00:56:17,149 --> 00:56:19,944
最后一次见到我的小女儿
I mean, I ain't seen my youngest, my sweet girl, for....

553
00:56:20,152 --> 00:56:21,445
还是她4周大的时候
Since she was four weeks old.

554
00:56:21,654 --> 00:56:22,863
喝水吗
Water?

555
00:56:27,243 --> 00:56:28,744
你呢
What about you?

556
00:56:31,038 --> 00:56:32,498
我必须拿冠军
I have to win.

00:56:34,792 --> 00:56:36,419
你必须拿冠军？
You have to win.

558
00:56:36,585 --> 00:56:38,629
你不明白的
You would not understand.

559
00:56:38,838 --> 00:56:39,839
说来听听
Try me.

560
00:56:44,802 --> 00:56:47,722
上帝给了我一项天赋

561
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,181
只有一项
Only one.

562
00:56:51,434 --> 00:56:54,729
我是世界上
I am the most complete fighter...

563
00:56:54,895 --> 00:56:56,689
最优秀的格斗士
...in the world.

564
00:56:58,482 --> 00:57:01,068
我一生都在训练
My whole life, I've trained.

565
00:57:03,154 --> 00:57:04,822
为了什么
For what?

566
00:57:06,866 --> 00:57:09,535
就为了证阴自己
I must prove I am worthy of something.

567
00:57:11,912 --> 00:57:13,372
真是的
Damn.

568
00:57:15,124 --> 00:57:18,210
我都不忍心打败你了
I'm gonna feel bad when I'm whipping that ass.

569
00:57:27,303 --> 00:57:29,096
时间到了
It's about time.

570
00:57:36,562 --> 00:57:38,564
我要下别的注
I'd like to place a new bet.

现在不是逞能的时候 你必须离开这里

这里的保安不是非常严密

645
01:08:48,526 --> 01:08:50,277
因为我们是来参赛的

我要砸断你的链条

- So, what, you my guardian angel now? - I'm no angel.

649
01:09:00,079 --> 01:09:02,915
不 我要和这个混蛋打

667
01:10:02,308 --> 01:10:05,227
不可能因此而取消决赛
They will not destroy their final payday.

668
01:10:06,312 --> 01:10:09,774
俄国人 你为什么要这么做

684
01:12:37,171 --> 01:12:43,135
在这些格斗士中 我们还以为
You know, of all the fighters I expected would give us trouble...

685
01:12:43,302 --> 01:12:45,262
你是最不可能闹事的
...you were the last on the list.

686
01:12:45,471 --> 01:12:49,809
那个美国人呢 我们会找到他的

687
01:12:53,813 --> 01:12:55,356
我要见格格

你以为格格就能帮助你吗
Do you think Gaga or anyone else can help you?

690
01:13:04,991 --> 01:13:10,621
你以为他在乎你吗 但他在乎钱
- You think Gaga gives a shit about you? - He gives a shit about his money.

691
01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:11,914
我就是他的摇钱树
And that's what I am.

692
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,584
这可未必

以你的膝盖你 打不过哥伦比亚人
You just can't beat the Colombian, not with your knee.

698
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:38,566
你和这帮禽兽串通
You are with these animals?

699
01:13:38,733 --> 01:13:40,818

701
01:13:42,778 --> 01:13:45,990
我们不得不即兴发挥
We have been forced to improvise.

702

好吧 我是犹大
Okay. Okay, I'm a fucking Judas.

708

这让你成了什么呢
Now, that makes you what?

709
01:14:11,766 --> 01:14:14,644

The winner from Russia is Boyka.

759
01:25:04,293 --> 01:25:09,757
你不是说有完全的把握吗
"I guarantee you," huh? "I absolutely guarantee it. "

760
01:25:09,924 --> 01:25:12,593
你这混蛋
You ancient fuck.

761
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:15,846
你让我损失了500万美元
You just cost me $5 million, Rezo.

762

我要生吃了你

你搞砸了
You fucked up.

766
01:25:46,293 --> 01:25:47,920
我也不知道怎么会这样
I don't know how this happened.

767
01:25:48,129 --> 01:25:49,422
我不想听你辩解
I don't give a rat's ass how.

768
01:25:49,588 --> 01:25:52,341
我只知道你让我欠了一屁股债
All I know, I'm out a shitload of money that I don't have.

769
01:25:52,508 --> 01:25:54,468
你必须赔偿我的损失
And you're gonna have to come up with it.

770
01:25:58,764 --> 01:25:59,932
去死吧
Die.

771
01:26:26,584 --> 01:26:28,127
你打的很好 博伊卡先生
You did well, Mr. Boyka.

772
01:26:28,294 --> 01:26:30,921
我不稀罕你的奖赏
I don't want your fucking prize.

773
01:26:31,088 --> 01:26:32,506
带我去前门就行了
Just show me the front door.

774
01:26:33,174 --> 01:26:35,009
关于这一点
Yes, well, about that....

775
01:26:35,176 --> 01:26:36,302
怎么了
About what?

776
01:26:36,677 --> 01:26:39,347
恐怕有一点麻烦
I'm afraid we have a problem.

777
01:26:39,639 --> 01:26:41,641
这次比赛的规则是
You see, the agreement of this tournament...

778
01:26:41,849 --> 01:26:44,101
只有一个人能得到自由
...was that one man would receive his freedom.

779
01:26:47,229 --> 01:26:49,482
你还知道有规则
You're talking about agreements now?

780
01:26:50,066 --> 01:26:52,860
不幸的 是我们还没找到美国人
Unfortunately, we have not recovered the American.

781
01:26:53,486 --> 01:26:55,863
既然你要为他的逃走负责
And since you're responsible for his escape...

782
01:26:56,030 --> 01:26:59,575
恐一白你已经丧失了自由离开的机会
...I'm afraid you have forfeited your chance to leave here a free man.

783
01:27:00,076 --> 01:27:03,913
总之 你不能自由离开这家监狱
Anyway, you're not walking free out of this facility.

784
01:27:04,372 --> 01:27:07,416
你还要回到厕所里干活
Indeed, you're going right back to the toilet you came from.

785
01:27:11,003 --> 01:27:13,631
我做了必须做的
I did what I had to do.

786
01:27:16,884 --> 01:27:18,844
至于去哪里
Where I go now...

787
01:27:20,012 --> 01:27:21,305
我不在乎
...I don't care.

788
01:27:21,806 --> 01:27:26,310
很好 那你就不会再有反抗了
Good, then you'll not annoy me with any resistance.

789
01:27:26,769 --> 01:27:28,813
一辆巴士在外面等着
A bus is waiting outside.

790
01:27:49,542 --> 01:27:53,462
我想对你说你是个优秀的格斗士
I will give you this, you're quite a fighter.

791
01:27:53,921 --> 01:27:56,007
优秀的格斗士
Quite a fighter.

792
01:27:56,173 --> 01:27:58,801
很遗憾你现在是残品了
Too bad you're such damaged goods.

793
01:27:58,968 --> 01:28:01,721
我已经安排剔除你这残品了
I have already arranged to have you picked up.

794
01:28:01,929 --> 01:28:03,139
很遗憾你没得到自由
Pity about your freedom.

795
01:28:04,098 --> 01:28:05,683
这就是我的自由
This is my freedom.

796
01:28:28,956 --> 01:28:30,416
你们不该招惹我
You fucked with the wrong nigga.

797
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:36,464
我们走
Let's go.

798
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:39,050
你为什么这么做
Why did you do this?

799
01:28:39,216 --> 01:28:43,054
你哪来这么多问题
Stop asking so many fucking questions.

800
01:28:43,596 --> 01:28:45,473
我们去哪儿
Where are we going?

801
01:28:47,391 --> 01:28:49,477
天啊 真好吃
God, it's good.

802
01:28:58,944 --> 01:29:00,613
打开
Open it.

803
01:29:00,821 --> 01:29:02,615
打开啊
Go ahead, open it.

804
01:29:06,202 --> 01:29:08,037
这是你的那份
It's your share.

805
01:29:08,579 --> 01:29:10,748
我把钱都押在你身上了
I put all my money on you.

806
01:29:10,915 --> 01:29:13,626
你了解我这人 只为了钱
Oh, you know me, I'm all about money.

807
01:29:13,793 --> 01:29:19,173
不管你的膝盖有没有伤 甚至有没有膝盖
And you, well, good knee, bad knee, no knee...

808
01:29:19,340 --> 01:29:22,843
你仍然是世上最优秀的格斗士 尤其在你愤怒的时候
...you're still the best fighter in the world, especially when you're angry.

809
01:29:23,928 --> 01:29:27,765
不管什么胆固醇了 赢了我就想吃
Heh, heh. Fuck cholesterol, winning makes me hungry.

810
01:29:29,058 --> 01:29:31,978
你现在是自由人了 感觉如何
You're a free man now. How does it feel?

811
01:29:35,898 --> 01:29:39,360
你要跟着他走？是的
- You're going with him? - Yeah.

812
01:29:39,735 --> 01:29:42,655
你的孩子也是 对
- And your children? - Heh. Yeah.

813
01:29:45,533 --> 01:29:47,284
我必须走了 停车
I must go. Stop the car.

814
01:29:48,744 --> 01:29:50,287
好吧
Okay.

815
01:29:58,296 --> 01:30:00,798
喂 俄国人

Yo, yo, yo, Russia, Russia, Russia.

816
01:30:04,302 --> 01:30:06,512
你不用谢我
Look, you ain't got to thank me.

817
01:30:07,096 --> 01:30:08,889
我欠你的恩情
Hell, I owed you.

818
01:30:09,056 --> 01:30:11,517
你不欠我的 不是的
- You didn't owe me. - Yeah, I did.

819
01:30:11,892 --> 01:30:15,730
在我们国家 没汁么自由
Where I'm from, there ain't shit for free.

820
01:30:16,981 --> 01:30:20,151
而在我们国家一切都为了自由
And where I'm from, everything was for free.

821
01:30:20,318 --> 01:30:22,570
而这都是胡说
And it was all shit.

822
01:30:24,363 --> 01:30:26,032
你想好去哪儿吗
Any idea where you're gonna go, man?

823
01:30:30,036 --> 01:30:31,579
特伯先生 我在等着昵

Look, I better get out of here.

825

830
01:30:56,854 --> 01:30:57,938

01:30:58,214 --> 01:30:59,544
Heh.

01:31:26,425 --> 01:31:31,347
差点忘了 我们之间的事还没有了结呢
Oh, almost forgot, you and me, we got some unfinished business.

838
01:31:34,141 --> 01:31:36,227
我们的比赛？没错
