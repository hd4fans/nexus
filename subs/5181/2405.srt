我在俄国的公司

25
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:47,997
是冷战时期的十倍
within United States borders asabcit did during the Cold War.

26
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,667
你不知道吗 而且 你如果明智的话
What are we talking about? Besides,abcwouldn't it be wise for you...

27
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,045
这种形式下 不是应该放弃你在俄国的公司吗

00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:05,889
总统会认为 在目前担心是没有帮助的
The President would suggest that fearabcis not helpful right now, Senator...

31
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:09,727

He's Iying in an alley with his throat slit.

104
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:47,838
是别人模仿他的手法
Then it's a copycat.

105
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:50,925
每个人都这么说 除了一个人
That's what everyone is saying. Well, almost everyone.

106
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:59,016

大家知道 保罗曾经负责

追查“卡修斯七人组”
for tracking down the Cassius Seven...

119
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,571
这是我们为俄国杀手取的绰号
The Soviet assassins we code-named...

120
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:56,240
借用杀害凯撒的七位古罗马元老院议员
for the Roman senators who killed Julius Caesar.

121
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:59,034
据我所知 他们都被你抓住了 只除了一个人
And you caught them all but one,abcfrom what I understand.

122
00:10:59,118 --> 00:11:01,245
没抓到卡修斯本人
Missed Cassius himself?

123
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,539
是的
That's right.

124
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:06,208
但这不是他干的 我肯定
But this is not his work. I'm sure of it.

125
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:08,544
我觉得是他
Oh, I think it is.

126
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:10,421
这人是谁
Who the hell is this?

127
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:13,215
这是我的人 本・吉尔利特工
This is one of my men. Agent Ben Geary.

128
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:16,260
在联邦调查局 他对卡修斯最了解
Probably knows more about yourabcassassin than anyone we've got.

129
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,929
中情局中也没人比他更了解
Or the CIA, for that matter.

130
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:22,558
保罗 我们希望你们两人合作
Paul, we'd like the two of you to work together.

131
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:25,436
是吗 告诉我 吉尔利
Is that so? So tell me, Geary...

132
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,272
柏林墙倒塌的时候 你在干什么
what were you doing when the wall came down?

133
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,566
我当时在电视上看
I was watching it on television.

134
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:33,235
在坐的和位也是一样
Just Iike everyone else in this room.

135
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,735
[laughter]

136
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:37,865
请调出案卷
Could you pull up the case file, please?

137
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,745
好的 看 下刀的地方
Okay, here is good. Notice how the cut starts...

138
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:45,247
在喉咙正中 然后向上割开
right in the center of the throat, moving upwards.

139
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:47,917
一般来说 下刀会在上面 向旁边割开
Typically, a cut starts high, moves lateral...

140
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,753
从左边划到右边
as the right-handed killer pullsabcthe knife from ear to ear.

141
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:53,589
卡修斯不是这样 他的刀口都是一样的
Not Cassius. His cuts were always exactly the same.

142
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:57,259
右手 向上 从喉咙中间下刀
Right-handed, but up, and startingabcin the middle of the neck.

143
00:11:57,343 --> 00:11:59,261
我一直不明白为什么
I've never been able to figure out why.

144
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:01,972
仍然是别人模仿他的手法
Still, it's a copycat.

145
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:04,433
这就是所谓的专家？
This guy's the best you've got?

146
00:12:04,517 --> 00:12:09,105
谢泼德森先生 我写过关于卡修斯的硕士论文
Mr. Shepherdson, I wrote myabcMaster's thesis on Cassius.

147
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:11,315
我跟踪调查过
And I have tracked down and interviewed...

148
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:14,443
目击他作案的极少数人中的每一位
every one of the few witnesses ofabchis crimes who are still alive.

149
00:12:14,527 --> 00:12:17,446
我甚至设计过、并亲自走过他所有作案的
I've even re-created and personallyabcwalked the approaches and exits...

150
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:20,116
入口和出口 我了解这个人
of all his known kills step for step. I know this man.

151
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:24,662
我完全相信 这是卡修斯干的
And there is no doubt in my mind.abcThis is the work of Cassius.

152
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,414
你了解他？
You know him?

153
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:29,792
你是哈佛毕业的吧
Harvard, right?

154
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,670
是的
Yes, that's right.

155
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:36,298
你是驻土耳其大使馆一位外交官的儿子
And you were the son of a foreign attaché in Turkey.

156
00:12:36,382 --> 00:12:40,469
我父亲在很多大使馆工作过
My father worked at embassies all over the world.

157
00:12:40,553 --> 00:12:41,971
你怎么知道的
How do you know this?

158
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:43,681
我看过你的硕士论文
I read your thesis.

159
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,808
是吗
You did?

160
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:48,144
你当时一直想采访我
And I know you were trying for months to talk to me.

161
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:51,689
告诉你我为何拒绝了 因为你只是纸上谈兵
I'll tell you why I refused. Because youabchave never been on the ground.

162
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:56,652
因为你不了解他 也因为你只是图书管理员
Because you don't know him. Andabcbecause you're a Iibrarian.

163
00:12:56,736 --> 00:12:58,696
谢泼德森先生
Mr. Shepherdson.

164
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:01,991
吉尔利 假如我真的错了 你查出来是他
Let's just say, Geary, that I'mabcwrong and you expose him.

165
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:03,993
你觉得下一步是什么
What do you think comes next?

166
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:07,663
你觉得他会追杀你？
You think maybe he's gonna come after you?

167
00:13:07,747 --> 00:13:11,125
我正是为此而来
That is exactly why I'm here.

168
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:17,506
我要回去了
[exhales]

169
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,504
I'm going home.

170
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,718
希望不要再来烦我 好吗
And I'd like to be left alone. All right?

171
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,970
我们抓住了布鲁图
We've got Brutus.

172
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:26,849
什么
What?

173
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:30,353
伊戈尔・伊万诺维奇・科扎克 又名布鲁图
Igor Ivanovich Kozak, aka Brutus...

174
00:13:30,436 --> 00:13:33,189
他还活着 正关在Brinkerman监狱
is alive and locked up in Brinkerman Penitentiary.

175
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:36,067
不可能 1989年他在萨尔兹堡把他杀了
That's impossible. He killed him in Salzburg in 1989.

176
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:39,195
我开枪打中他的胸部 他摔下了三层楼
I shot him in the chest. He fell three stories.

177
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:40,738
他活了下来
And survived.

178
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:42,198
你为何没告诉我
Why didn't you tell me?

179
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:43,908
你当时想退休 保罗
You wanted to retire, Paul.

180
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:46,911
退休的人 有些事情就不能让他知道了
I'm afraid retirees Iose certain privileges.

181
00:13:48,454 --> 00:13:49,663
既然这样
You know what?

182
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,708
这里没我什么事了
I'm done here, Tom.

183
00:14:38,713 --> 00:14:40,965
给我接海兰
Get me Highland.

184
00:14:46,012 --> 00:14:48,306
我知道你在 给我接海兰
Come on, I know you're there. Get me Highland.

185
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:51,767
您拨的号码是空号
(operator) Your call cannot be completed as dialed.

186
00:14:51,851 --> 00:14:54,312
海兰局长想告诉你
Director Highland wants youabcto know he has a meeting...

187
00:14:54,395 --> 00:14:56,105
他明早和总统会面
with the President tomorrow morning.

188
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:58,899
他说你知道这意味着什么
He said you'd know what that means.

189
00:15:26,886 --> 00:15:28,846
早上好 两份 照旧
Good morning. Two regulars, please.

190
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,973
早上好 先生 马上就好
Good morning, sir. Coming right up.

191
00:15:34,894 --> 00:15:38,522
特工不该养成任何习惯
Spooks aren't supposed to be creatures of habit.

192
00:15:38,606 --> 00:15:41,817
当了领导就无所谓了
It's a Iuxury one can only afford when one is in charge.

193
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:43,402
谢谢
Thank you.

194
00:15:43,486 --> 00:15:44,946
非常谢谢

谢谢
Thanks.

196
00:15:56,082 --> 00:15:59,168
我为你干了20年 汤姆
I gave you 20 years, Tom.

197
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:02,838
你保证过会让我过上正常生活
You promised me I could have a Iife.

198
00:16:02,922 --> 00:16:05,508
我从来都不喜欢白宫的咖啡
I never cared much for the coffee at The White House.

199
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:08,886
可能是不习惯那里150年历史的瓷杯子
I think it's got something to doabcwith the 150-year-old china.

200
00:16:10,763 --> 00:16:14,016
我是三任总统的中情局长
I've been Director through three presidents, Paul.

201
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,852
说实话 当初如果不是你
And Iet's face it. I wouldn't have gottenabcthe job in the first place...

202
00:16:16,936 --> 00:16:19,438
打掉“卡修斯七人组”团伙 我也当不了局长
if you hadn't helped us with the Cassius Seven.

203
00:16:19,522 --> 00:16:23,526
15分钟后 总统就会说 如果抓不住杀害达顿参议员的凶手
In 15 minutes, the President is gonna tellabcme I don't have this job anymore...

204
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:26,529
我就不再是局长了
if we can't nail the guy that killed Senator Darden.

205
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:28,489
不是卡修斯干的 汤姆
It's not Cassius, Tom.

206
00:16:29,782 --> 00:16:31,325
你从未抓住他
You never caught him.

207
00:16:34,787 --> 00:16:38,124
那是因为他死了
Because he's dead.

208
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,377
那你就证明
Then prove it.

209
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,341

谢泼德森先生
Mr. Shepherdson?

215
00:18:20,101 --> 00:18:22,270
卡修斯七人组
The Cassius Seven.

216
00:18:25,064 --> 00:18:26,649
我有了突破
I've had a breakthrough.

217
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:29,277
我可以帮你抓住他
I can take them down for you.

218
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,171
我会解决的 只要给我15分钟
(agent) I'll take care of it. Justabcgive me about 15 minutes.

219
00:18:48,254 --> 00:18:49,881
喂
Oh, hey.

220

不知道
I don't know.

222
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:54,343
贝尔局长在场？
Director Bell was there?

223
00:18:54,427 --> 00:18:56,429
很多人都在场
Everyone was there.

224
00:18:56,512 --> 00:18:59,223
天 我在这里干的时间比你还要长一年
Jesus! I've been at this place a year Ionger than you...

225
00:18:59,307 --> 00:19:02,018
也从没见过局长本人
and I've never even seen the Director in person.

226
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:06,189
他们会派你执行任务 我能肯定
They're gonna put you in the field, man. I'm sure of it.

227
00:19:06,272 --> 00:19:08,357
他们什么都没说
They haven't said anything, yet.

228
00:19:08,441 --> 00:19:11,235
这个案子你一直都是对的
You were right about this thing the whole time, huh?

229
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,568
[telephone rings]

230
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:16,199

怎么样
And?

234
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:33,007
我要调查这案子了
I'm in.

235
00:19:54,654 --> 00:19:57,114
真没想到
This is crazy.

236
00:19:57,198 --> 00:20:00,451
我花了很长时间研究你对卡修斯的调查
'Cause I have spent so much timeabcstudying your work with Cassius.

237
00:20:00,535 --> 00:20:02,245
感觉似乎了解你了
I feel Iike I know you.

238
00:20:02,328 --> 00:20:04,789
你不了解
You don't.

239
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:08,417
对 我只是把我假设成你
Yeah. No, I just mean I-I, you know,abcI put myself in your shoes.

240
00:20:08,501 --> 00:20:10,920
研究你会想什么
I just tried to think how you would think.

241
00:20:11,003 --> 00:20:14,090
我有很多犯罪现场照片 不少照片中也有你
I've all of these crime scene photos.abcA lot of them you're in.

242
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:17,760
真该拿张照片让你签名的
Actually, I should probably get youabcto sign one of them. Right?

243
00:20:17,844 --> 00:20:20,471
那肯定将是第一次签名
That would definitely be a first.

244
00:20:20,555 --> 00:20:23,975
你91年去布达佩斯的时候 有没有注意到一种特定的模式？
When you were in Budapest in 91,abcdid you notice a specific pattern?

245
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:26,144
吉尔利特工
No, Agent Geary.

246
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:30,773
告诉我 你一个
Tell me why-why would a guy...

247
00:20:30,857 --> 00:20:33,609
写过国际罪犯论文的人
who writes a thesis on an international spy...

248
00:20:33,693 --> 00:20:36,779
为何加入联邦调查局 而不是中情局呢
join the Bureau and not Central Intelligence?

249
00:20:36,863 --> 00:20:41,451
我认为卡修斯藏在美国
Well, I believed that Cassius was hiding in the U.S.

250
00:20:41,534 --> 00:20:44,579
想想吧 苏联特工退休后去哪里最好呢
Think about it. What better placeabcfor a Soviet spook to retire?

251
00:20:46,414 --> 00:20:50,001
你就凭此来选择你的事业？
You believe that enough to base a career on it?

252
00:20:50,084 --> 00:20:52,670
对 可以这么说
Uh, yeah. You could say that.

253
00:20:52,754 --> 00:20:54,464
我能问你个问题吗
Can I ask you something?

254
00:20:54,547 --> 00:20:59,135
可以 只要你能闭嘴
If that means you'll stop talking, yeah.

255
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:02,013
他们为何不告诉你布鲁图没死？
Why didn't they tell you about Brutus?

256
00:21:02,096 --> 00:21:05,850
既然你的职责就是抓住卡修斯七人组 他们为何不敢告诉你呢
If it was your job to catch the Cassius Seven,abcwhat were they scared you'd do?

257
00:21:08,561 --> 00:21:10,104
怕我杀他
Kill him.

258
00:21:31,918 --> 00:21:33,836
包里是什么
What's in the bag?

[clears throat]

265
00:22:21,092 --> 00:22:24,971
我知道想了解卡修斯的事 就要找你
[talks in Russian]

266
00:22:24,971 --> 00:22:27,056
你懂俄语？
You speak Russian, huh?

267
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,392
我在学校学过
I studied in school. Yes.

268
00:22:29,475 --> 00:22:32,854
我给你来句俄语
Here's some Russian for you.

你妈是个婊子

270
00:22:38,526 --> 00:22:42,113
我看资料 你和卡修斯共事过
I've read that you worked with Cassius.

271
00:22:43,489 --> 00:22:44,907
那都是多年以前了
It's a different Iife ago.

272
00:22:44,991 --> 00:22:46,576
你知道他藏在哪儿吗
Do you know where he's hiding?

273
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:49,912
你为何...
Why would you--

274
00:22:52,165 --> 00:22:53,916
卡修斯还活着？
Is Cassius alive?

275
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,376
他杀了个参议员
He killed a Senator.

276
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:01,716
你是谁
Who are you?

277
00:23:06,512 --> 00:23:11,309
我知道10年来你一直希望有个这种东西

278
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,891

给我
Give it to me.

281
00:23:22,028 --> 00:23:25,239
告诉我一些卡修斯的情况 我就送给你
Tell me something that I don't knowabcabout Cassius and it is yours.

282
00:23:26,866 --> 00:23:28,993
不想听听外面的世界吗
A chance to hear the outside world?

283
00:23:29,077 --> 00:23:30,953
给我 你这混蛋
Give it to me, you son of a whore!

284
00:23:31,037 --> 00:23:33,289
告诉我卡修斯的情况 他训练过你吗
Tell me something about Cassius. Did he train you?

285

他什么模样

[music stops]

288
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:54,268
你就在寂静中过一辈子吧
I guess you can spend the rest of your Iife in silence.

289
00:23:56,229 --> 00:23:57,939
狱警
Guard?

290
00:23:59,065 --> 00:24:00,817
等等
[shouts] Wait!

291
00:24:05,738 --> 00:24:07,657
好吧
Okay.

292
00:24:09,242 --> 00:24:11,703
他是一个出名的战士
He made his name as a soldier.

293
00:24:11,786 --> 00:24:15,832
但他并没有选择轻松的上学
But rather than take the easyabcroute through the academia...

294
00:24:15,915 --> 00:24:18,501
而是练就了其它的本事
he honed other skills.

295
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:20,211
还训练了你？
And he trained you?

296
00:24:20,295 --> 00:24:23,381
我们都是他训练的 以他的方式
He trained us all ...his way.

297
00:24:23,464 --> 00:24:26,342
他只想要最棒的
He only wanted the best.

298
00:24:26,426 --> 00:24:28,052
为此他想看到证明
For that he wanted proof.

299
00:24:28,052 --> 00:24:29,971
上面是你们要杀的人

300
00:24:36,769 --> 00:24:39,522
我们只有6个活了下来
Only six of us survived.

301
00:24:39,605 --> 00:24:44,193
再加上他 就成为你们所说的“卡修斯七人组”
And together we became your Cassius Seven.

302
00:24:44,277 --> 00:24:46,070
然后你再没见过他？
And you never saw him again?

303
00:24:46,154 --> 00:24:48,072
没有
No.

304
00:24:48,156 --> 00:24:52,201
我们通过通常渠道 从他那里得到暗杀目标
We got our targets from himabcthrough the usual channels.

305
00:24:52,285 --> 00:24:55,038
但怎么下手都是他计划的
But he planned the kills.

306
00:24:55,121 --> 00:24:58,750
他的情报总是最精确的
His intel was always the best.

307
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:02,545
对于何时动手 他的直觉总是最敏锐的
His instinct for when to strike, always sharpest.

308
00:25:02,629 --> 00:25:04,380
他为何失踪了
What happened to him?

309
00:25:04,464 --> 00:25:06,716
他犯了错误
He made mistake.

310
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,761
他违反了规矩
He lived outside parameters.

311
00:25:09,844 --> 00:25:11,554
什么规矩
What kind of parameters?

312
00:25:11,638 --> 00:25:14,891
杀手的规矩
Parameters of an assassin.

313
00:25:14,974 --> 00:25:16,559
你把他怎么样了
What did you do to him?

314
00:25:16,643 --> 00:25:18,061
把收音机给他
Give him the radio.

315
00:25:18,144 --> 00:25:19,729
不 我想问清楚...
No, no. I wanna hear specifically--

316
00:25:19,812 --> 00:25:21,397
我让你把收音机给他
I said give him the radio!

317
00:25:21,481 --> 00:25:23,650
照做 给他
Just do it! Give it to him.

318
00:25:28,655 --> 00:25:29,739
我们走
AII right. Let's go.

319
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,784
走
Come on!

320

[gate opens and closes]

324
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:48,758
刚才怎么回事
What the hell was that?

325
00:25:48,841 --> 00:25:51,094
为什么不让我问完
Why didn't you Iet me finish my Iine of questioning?

326
00:25:51,177 --> 00:25:52,762
因为他在撒谎
Because he was Iying.

327
00:25:52,845 --> 00:25:54,931
我以前杀他是有原因的
I tried to kill him once for a reason.

328
00:25:55,014 --> 00:25:57,100
但是金属丝完全符合
Yeah, but the wire makes perfect sense.

329
00:25:57,183 --> 00:25:59,477
恰好说明为何刀口总是从中间开始
It explains why the cuts alwaysabcstart from the middle...

330
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,938
然后向上划开 这就说明了一切
and then work their way up. This opens up everything.

331
00:26:02,021 --> 00:26:03,982
我明早要去局里
I gotta get in there early tomorrow morning...

332
00:26:04,065 --> 00:26:06,609
把刀口和其它的金属丝杀人案比较一下

嗨 保罗
Hey, Paul.

425
00:35:29,756 --> 00:35:33,009
吉尔利特工 你有什么发现？再见
Agent Geary. What do you got? See you Iater.

426
00:35:33,093 --> 00:35:36,888
布鲁特看来吞了我们给他的收音机的电池
Apparently Brutus swallowed the batteriesabcfrom the radio that we gave him.

427
00:35:36,972 --> 00:35:40,016
估计他打了几个电话 找个藏身处
I'm guessing he put out some calls.abcFound a place to Iay Iow.

428
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,394
被卡修斯得到消息
Word got back to Cassius.

429
00:35:42,477 --> 00:35:45,230
他不想留下后患
He's never one to allow Ioose ends.

430
00:35:45,313 --> 00:35:48,024
后患 你是指他和我们谈过
Loose ends, meaning he spoke to us.

431
00:35:48,108 --> 00:35:50,902
应该是吧
Probably. Yeah.

432
00:35:50,986 --> 00:35:53,405
我们要收集医院内的
Well, we should get all the phone records...

433
00:35:53,488 --> 00:35:56,533
所有手机通话记录
of every cell phone hospital extension here.

434
00:35:56,616 --> 00:35:57,909
好
AII right. Okay.

435
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:04,749
我一直有个假设
You know, I always had this theory...

436
00:36:06,793 --> 00:36:09,838
卡修斯会回到他的犯罪现场
that Cassius would return to the scene of his crimes.

437
00:36:11,631 --> 00:36:13,925
看着调查案子的人
Watch his investigators.

438
00:36:15,302 --> 00:36:17,554
你觉得他那么虚荣？
You think he's that vain?

439
00:36:17,637 --> 00:36:21,099
我觉得一部分是虚荣
Well, I think that some of it's vanity.

440
00:36:21,182 --> 00:36:24,019
也是为了看看他的对手是谁
Some of it is he wants to see what he's up against.

441
00:36:32,986 --> 00:36:35,071
看见后面那个穿褐色夹克的人吗
You see that guy in the back? Brown jacket.

442
00:36:35,155 --> 00:36:37,449
俄国品牌的夹克
Coat's Russian made.

443
00:36:40,827 --> 00:36:42,746
喂 先生 先生
Excuse me, sir? Sir?

444
00:36:42,829 --> 00:36:45,040
靠 让开
(Geary) Shit! Move!

445
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,164
[panting]

446
00:37:32,754 --> 00:37:36,132
好  我们分头去追
AII right. Why don't we split up?

447
00:37:36,216 --> 00:37:37,634
好
Yeah.

448
00:37:37,717 --> 00:37:39,177
你去那里
You go that way.

449
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,477
[exhales]

450
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,715
[clanking]

451
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,934
[exhales]

452
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,903
我没有发现
I've got nothing.

453
00:39:19,986 --> 00:39:21,947
我也没有 报告联邦调查局
Yeah, me neither. Let the Bureau know.

454
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:24,116
他穿着褐色小山羊皮夹克
He's wearing a brown suede jacket.

455
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:26,243
金发 平头
Sandy blond hair, close cropped.

456
00:39:26,326 --> 00:39:29,079
不 他不是卡修斯
No. That wasn't him.

457
00:39:29,162 --> 00:39:31,414
他个子不高
He was too tall.

458
00:39:31,498 --> 00:39:36,086
气质 体型 年龄 太多地方不符合
Too military. Wrong build. Too young.abcA million reasons. It wasn't him.

459
00:39:36,169 --> 00:39:38,296
那我们为何追他
What the hell were we doing chasing this guy?

460
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,716
他逃跑 我估计他肯定有什么罪名
He ran. I figured he'd be arrested for something.

461
00:39:49,015 --> 00:39:51,143
你饿了吗
You hungry?

462
00:40:10,871 --> 00:40:13,957
嗨 保罗 这是我老婆 娜塔莉
Hey, Paul. This is my wife, Natalie.

463
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,168
你好 谢泼德森先生
Hello, Mr. Shepherdson.

464
00:40:16,251 --> 00:40:17,502
叫我保罗
Hey. Paul.

465
00:40:17,586 --> 00:40:18,754
保罗
Paul.

466
00:40:21,047 --> 00:40:24,968
我好久没去别人家吃过饭了
It's been a Iong time since I wentabcto someone's house for dinner.

467
00:40:25,052 --> 00:40:27,679
不懂得什么礼节
I, uh, I never Iearned how to do it right.

468
00:40:27,763 --> 00:40:32,017
很简单 你只要微笑着点头 说饭菜很好吃
Well, it's easy. You just smile andabcnod and tell me how good it is.

469
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,643
是
Yes, ma'am.

470
00:40:33,727 --> 00:40:36,480
"是"你听见了吗
Ma'am? Did you hear that?

471
00:40:36,563 --> 00:40:38,148
阁下这边请
Well, right this way, sir.

472
00:40:38,231 --> 00:40:41,443
欢迎光临寒舍
Let me welcome you to our humble commode.

473
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,696
[kid humming]

474
00:40:57,292 --> 00:40:59,711
帮我准备晚饭吧
Wanna help me get dinner ready?

475
00:40:59,795 --> 00:41:02,339
准备晚饭
Dinner ready?

476
00:41:02,422 --> 00:41:04,841
我帮不了什么忙 对不起
I'm not gonna be much help. I'm sorry.

477
00:41:04,925 --> 00:41:07,886
只要把爸爸从后院挪到厨房里
It's easy. Just move the dad fromabcthe backyard to the kitchen.

478
00:41:07,969 --> 00:41:09,971
这是你爸爸？我看看
That's your dad? Let's see.

479
00:41:12,432 --> 00:41:15,519
喂 保罗 见见这个小家伙
Hey, Paul. Come meet this Iittle guy.

480
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,390
[chuckles]

481
00:41:17,479 --> 00:41:19,189
他叫尼古拉斯
It's Nicholas.

482
00:41:19,272 --> 00:41:21,525
哇
Wow.

483
00:41:21,608 --> 00:41:23,860
长得很像你
Yeah. Looks Iike you.

484
00:41:23,944 --> 00:41:25,070
不像
No.

485
00:41:25,153 --> 00:41:26,697
鼻子随你
Yeah. Got your nose.

486
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,865
都说他像我爸爸
Everyone says he Iooks Iike my dad.

487
00:41:28,949 --> 00:41:31,576
这话我爱听 因为他10年前去世了
Which is nice 'cause we Iost him Iike ten years ago.

488
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,078
对不起
Yeah, I'm sorry.

489
00:41:33,161 --> 00:41:34,371
没关系
No, no, it's fine.

490
00:41:34,454 --> 00:41:35,872
他肯定是你儿子
He's definitely your kid.

491
00:41:35,956 --> 00:41:37,541
你有孩子吗 保罗？
Do you have any children, Paul?

492
00:41:37,624 --> 00:41:39,251
我没有
No. No, I don't.

493
00:41:39,334 --> 00:41:40,544
你喝酒吗
Do you want a drink?

494
00:41:40,627 --> 00:41:42,379
好
Yeah.

495
00:41:42,462 --> 00:41:44,756
孩子 来
Yeah, sweetie. Come on.

496
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,550
托着他的头
You got his head?

497
00:41:46,633 --> 00:41:48,760
来 露西 我们上楼
Come on, Lucy. Let's go set up, sweetie.

498
00:41:48,844 --> 00:41:50,429
保罗 你喝什么
Paul, what are you Iooking for?

499
00:41:50,512 --> 00:41:52,055
伏特加马提尼
Vodka martini?

500
00:41:52,139 --> 00:41:53,765
好的
Sure.

501
00:41:53,849 --> 00:41:55,726
不加冰 加一片洋葱
Dry. With, uh, an onion if you've got it.

502
00:41:55,809 --> 00:41:57,728
知道吗
You know what?

503
00:41:57,811 --> 00:42:00,731
你调查卡修斯的时间太长了
I think you've been chasing Cassius a Iittle too Iong.

504
00:42:00,814 --> 00:42:03,025
都喜欢他的酒了
That's his drink.

505
00:42:05,694 --> 00:42:08,613
都尽量了解他
Yeah. Well, trying to get into his head...

506
00:42:08,697 --> 00:42:12,075
也染上了一些他的习惯
I guess I picked up some of his habits.

507
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:15,454
尽然这样 我和你一起喝
You know what? In that case, I'm gonna join you.

508
00:42:21,835 --> 00:42:24,796
孩子们终于睡下了
The kids are down. Finally.

509
00:42:27,674 --> 00:42:29,926
我知道你会觉得荒唐
Now, I know you're gonna say this is weird...

510
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:34,097
但我感觉和卡修斯心理相通
but I feel a connection with him. I do. With Cassius.

511
00:42:34,181 --> 00:42:36,933
他不是那种你能与之沟通的人
He's not the kind of guy that you can connect to.

512
00:42:37,017 --> 00:42:41,772
如果不算相通 也算是对他非常的尊敬
Well, sure. If not a connection, thenabca tremendous amount of respect.

513
00:42:41,855 --> 00:42:44,441
我要向你证明
AII right. Let's just set the record straight now.

514
00:42:44,524 --> 00:42:47,319
他不值得你任何的尊敬和钦佩
He's not worthy of your respect or admiration.

515
00:42:47,402 --> 00:42:49,279
他是个冷血杀手
He's a cold-blooded ki//er.

516
00:42:49,363 --> 00:42:51,990
不像你有个家庭
He doesn't have a family like you.

517
00:42:52,074 --> 00:42:54,618
不像你有个老婆
He doesn't have a wife Iike yours.

518
00:42:54,701 --> 00:42:56,953
他的一生一文不值
His Iife meant nothing.

519
00:42:57,037 --> 00:43:02,459
他做过唯一一件好事就是消失
The only good thing he everabcdid was disappear. All right?

520
00:43:02,542 --> 00:43:05,796
他在某些方面非常优秀
You don't think there's somethingabcto be respected in the fact that...

521
00:43:05,879 --> 00:43:08,006
你不觉得值得尊敬吗
he is the best at something?

522
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:12,344
对这样的禽兽 我没有一点尊敬
Respect is the Iast thing I haveabcfor an animal Iike him. Okay?

523
00:43:12,427 --> 00:43:14,137
没错 可是...
Yeah. But--

524
00:43:15,931 --> 00:43:19,142
等一下 我去撒尿
Hold that thought. I'm gonna take a piss.

525
00:43:19,226 --> 00:43:21,645
本
Ben?

526
00:43:21,728 --> 00:43:23,814
我只是说了大实话
I'm just stating the facts.

527
00:43:25,607 --> 00:43:27,150
他满脑子都是他
Paul, he's obsessed.

528
00:43:27,234 --> 00:43:28,819
是啊
Yeah, I know.

529
00:43:28,902 --> 00:43:31,154
自从我认识他就是这样
And he has been ever since I've known him.

530
00:43:31,238 --> 00:43:33,198
卡修斯
Cassius.

531
00:43:33,282 --> 00:43:35,158
还有你
And you!

532
00:43:35,242 --> 00:43:39,413
我希望你这个案子早点结束
You know, I'm-I'm just ready for it to be over.

533
00:43:44,251 --> 00:43:48,338
你丈夫招惹了一个
Your husband is messing with a creature...

534
00:43:48,422 --> 00:43:51,675
他自以为了解的人
he thinks he understands, but he doesn't.

535
00:43:51,758 --> 00:43:55,012
他之所以还没对你丈夫下手
He's allowed your husband...

536
00:43:55,095 --> 00:43:59,516
是因为他构不成太大威胁
to Iive this Iong because he wasn't much of a threat.

537
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,561
你这话什么意思
What do you mean, allowed him to Iive?

538
00:44:02,644 --> 00:44:05,147
你觉得他知道我丈夫是谁？
Do you think he knows who my husband is?

539
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:10,652
他肯定知道
I'm sure he does.

540
00:44:12,613 --> 00:44:15,157
你真的看过我的论文？
You really read my thesis?

541
00:44:16,617 --> 00:44:19,870
是的 我看过你的论文
Yes. Yes, I read your thesis.

542
00:44:19,953 --> 00:44:21,872
是吗
Yeah?

543
00:44:21,955 --> 00:44:23,624
怎么样
And?

544
00:44:26,501 --> 00:44:28,670
好吧 我觉得...
AII right. I think...

545
00:44:30,464 --> 00:44:34,259
你漏了一个重要的问题
that you missed an essential question.

546
00:44:34,343 --> 00:44:37,054
什么问题
Okay. What's that?

547
00:44:37,137 --> 00:44:40,891
你准确描述了卡修斯的方式和地点
You pinpointed the wheres and the hows of Cassius...

548
00:44:40,974 --> 00:44:44,394
但你从没问为什么
but you never ask the question why.

549
00:44:44,478 --> 00:44:48,732
为什么他杀的人越来越没有规律？
Why were his targets increasingly more random?

550
00:44:48,815 --> 00:44:50,901
他为何失踪
Why did he disappear?

551
00:44:50,984 --> 00:44:54,238
等你明白了这些问题
When you can answer those whys...

552
00:44:54,321 --> 00:44:56,198
你才能了解他
then you'll know him.

553
00:45:11,505 --> 00:45:14,258
替我再次谢谢娜塔莉
Thank Natalie again, will you?

554
00:45:14,341 --> 00:45:17,135
我们检查了医院的电话
Oh, we checked the calls from the hospital.

555
00:45:17,219 --> 00:45:18,303
怎么样
Yeah?

556
00:45:18,387 --> 00:45:21,098
没有发现
Nothing.

557
00:45:21,181 --> 00:45:22,808
太遗憾了
Tch. Too bad.

558
00:45:22,891 --> 00:45:25,435
是啊
Yeah.

559
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:27,479
问题是...
See, you know the thing that--

560
00:45:27,563 --> 00:45:29,690
我有一点不明白
Okay, here's what I don't understand.

561
00:45:29,773 --> 00:45:33,151
卡修斯怎么知道会把布鲁图转移到医院
How did Cassius know that theyabcmoved Brutus to a hospital...

562
00:45:33,235 --> 00:45:35,612
而不是在监狱里治疗呢
instead of just working on him at the prison?

563
00:45:35,696 --> 00:45:39,783
俄国人应该是买通了监狱里的人
The Russians probably paid somebody off in the prison.

564
00:45:39,867 --> 00:45:42,327
希望他死 杀人灭口
They'd want him dead just to shut him up.

565
00:45:42,411 --> 00:45:44,329
对 对
Right. Right.

566
00:45:44,413 --> 00:45:45,956
再见 吉尔利
Good night, Geary.

567
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:55,293
[dog barking]

568
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,319
[helicopter flying by]

569
00:46:29,791 --> 00:46:32,544
各位
Gentlemen?

570
00:46:32,628 --> 00:46:34,838
你们认识马丁・米勒吧
I think you guys know Martin Miller.

571
00:46:34,922 --> 00:46:37,382
他是研究国内俄国间谍的专家
He's our Chief Analyst on domestic Russian ops.

572
00:46:37,466 --> 00:46:40,177
开始吧 马丁
Go ahead, Marty.

573
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:44,348
大约半年前 两个BP特工被杀 卡车被抢
Almost six months ago, two B.P agentsabcwere murdered and their truck stolen.

574
00:46:44,431 --> 00:46:48,185
这辆卡车一周后出现在TUS附近 没留下蛛丝马迹
The truck was located a week later inabca parking lot near TUS wiped clean.

575
00:46:48,268 --> 00:46:51,396
这些人是聪明人 停车的地方离摄像头很远
Now, these guys were smart. They parkedabcfar enough away from the cameras...

576
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,899
辨别不出面容
that we couldn't get any facial recognition.

577
00:46:53,982 --> 00:46:56,860
当地警方和边境巡逻队估计他们是墨西哥人
Local cops and Border Patrolabcassumed they were Mexican.

578
00:46:56,944 --> 00:46:59,154
后来我们发现这个
Then we found this.

579
00:47:00,447 --> 00:47:02,574
警车上的摄像头？
A camera in a squad car.

580
00:47:02,658 --> 00:47:05,244
是的 幸运的是 图森警方在一些警车上
That's right. Luckily, Tucson police were testing...

581
00:47:05,327 --> 00:47:07,746
测试高分辨率摄像头
high-resolution cameras in a few cars.

582
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:10,916
都是俄国人 都是已知的特工
All Russian. All known operatives.

583
00:47:10,999 --> 00:47:13,710
现在都在美国
AII now in the United States.

584
00:47:13,794 --> 00:47:16,421
这是那个穿俄国夹克的人
(Geary) There's the guy with the Russian jacket.

585
00:47:16,505 --> 00:47:18,507
是的 还有更好的
That's right. And it gets better.

586
00:47:25,305 --> 00:47:27,432
等一下 等一下
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait.

587
00:47:35,983 --> 00:47:37,526
这混蛋
Son-of-a-bitch.

588
00:47:39,987 --> 00:47:41,405
巴兹洛斯基
Bozlovski.

589
00:47:41,488 --> 00:47:43,615
是的 约翰・巴兹洛斯基
That's right. Johann Bozlovski.

590
00:47:43,699 --> 00:47:47,244
前苏联特种部队和情报局特工
Former Spetsnaz and KGB.

591
00:47:47,327 --> 00:47:51,874
1990年 波兹洛斯基和他在"黑高加索"的第十山地旅
In 1990, Bozlovski and his 10th MountainabcBrigade in the Black Caucasus...

592
00:47:51,915 --> 00:47:55,752
进入华沙 处决了第三世界结盟运动的盟友
went into Warsaw and executed knownabcallies of the solidarity movement.

593
00:47:55,836 --> 00:47:59,131
在柏林墙倒塌后
I Iooked for him for a year...

594
00:47:59,214 --> 00:48:01,133
我找了他一年
after the wall came down.

595
00:48:01,216 --> 00:48:03,719
他突然失踪了
He just, just vanished.

596
00:48:08,015 --> 00:48:09,933
就像卡修斯
Like Cassius.

597
00:48:10,017 --> 00:48:11,894
你觉得呢 保罗
What are you thinking, Paul?

598
00:48:13,353 --> 00:48:15,606
一个已知的苏联杀手
We have a known Soviet hit man.

599
00:48:15,689 --> 00:48:19,276
失踪后进入利比亚或阿富汗
Disappears into Libya or Afghanistan.

600
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:22,279
与此同时 我们的情报显示卡修斯也是这样
Same time our intel tells us Cassius does the same.

601
00:48:22,362 --> 00:48:24,490
20年后 他露面了
Twenty years Iater, he shows up.

602
00:48:24,573 --> 00:48:27,993
美国参议员的喉咙被割开了
United States Senator gets his throat slit.

603
00:48:28,076 --> 00:48:30,996
我觉得不太可能
[exhales] I-I don't know.

604
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:33,457
波兹洛斯基是特种部队的
I mean, Bozlovski's Spetsnaz.

605
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,959
太显眼了
And... he's so visible.

606
00:48:36,043 --> 00:48:39,463
也许正是他们的意图所在
Well, yeah. Maybe that's what they wanted.

607
00:48:39,546 --> 00:48:42,633
派个显眼的人
And wouldn't a more visible alter ego...

608
00:48:42,716 --> 00:48:45,302
吸引我们的注意力 就会忽略别的
just muddy up the waters for everyone chasing him?

609
00:48:45,385 --> 00:48:49,807
我们怎么确定波兹洛斯基1990年在华沙？
How did we know Boz was in Warsaw in 1990?

610
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:51,475
怎么能确定？
How did we know that?

611
00:48:51,558 --> 00:48:54,144
只是因为俄国人是这么说的
Because the Russians told us so!

612
00:48:54,228 --> 00:48:57,314
在柏林墙倒塌前 苏联的假情报
Soviet disinformation was theabcbiggest weapon they had...

613
00:48:57,397 --> 00:48:58,982
是他们最大的武器
before the wall came down.

614
00:48:59,066 --> 00:49:00,484
没错
That's true.

615
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:02,104
[exhales]

616
00:49:05,739 --> 00:49:07,616
是啊
Yeah.

617
00:49:09,118 --> 00:49:10,494
有可能是波兹洛斯基
Bozlovski makes sense.

618
00:49:10,577 --> 00:49:12,204
就是他
It's him. He's the one.

619
00:49:12,287 --> 00:49:13,956
你们需要我们干什么
What do you guys need from us?

620
00:49:14,039 --> 00:49:17,167
什么都不要干 如果他知道我们盯上了他
Nothing. Nothing. He'll disappear again...

621
00:49:17,251 --> 00:49:19,920
他会再次消失的
if he knows we're onto him.

622
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:35,846
[alarm sounding]

623

安波？
Amber?

630
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:44,254
那个人走私俄国货
Yeah, that guy deals in Russian goods.

631
00:50:44,338 --> 00:50:46,632
任何来自俄国的东西
Anything from the homeland.

632
00:50:46,715 --> 00:50:48,384
拐入河边
Turn down by the river.

我来找安波

安波是个妓女？
Amber's a prostitute?

641
00:51:29,925 --> 00:51:33,012
如果俄国人用他们的女人而不是导弹做武器
If the Russians used their women instead of missiles...

642
00:51:33,095 --> 00:51:35,681
早就把我们征服了

This is the dirtiest river in the U.S. Did you know that?

00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:23,863
好 就是这里
Okay. This is the place.

712
00:57:23,946 --> 00:57:26,490
好 波兹洛斯基就在里面
Okay, Bozlovski, he's in there.

713
00:57:26,574 --> 00:57:28,576
别走 过来
No, no, no. No, no, come on.

714
00:57:44,633 --> 00:57:46,635
里奥 喂
Leo! Hey.

715
00:57:47,928 --> 00:57:49,221
你有几个妓女？
How many girls you got?

716
00:57:49,305 --> 00:57:52,057
告诉我 5个？10个？
Come on, tell me. Five? Ten?

717
00:57:52,141 --> 00:57:55,227
15个？告诉我
Fifteen? Talk to me. Huh?

718
00:57:56,979 --> 00:57:58,230
两个
Two.

719
00:57:58,314 --> 00:57:59,523
什么
What?

720
00:57:59,607 --> 00:58:04,028
-两个 -两个
Two.

721
00:58:05,821 --> 00:58:07,239
好
AII right.

722
00:58:07,323 --> 00:58:09,408
你带我找到波兹洛斯基
You get me to Bozlovski...

723
00:58:09,492 --> 00:58:11,869
就能继续你的生意
you keep your business...

724
00:58:11,952 --> 00:58:14,872
我也假装没见过你 好吗
and we never met. AII right?

725
00:58:14,955 --> 00:58:19,251
你呼叫后援 或者用你在基地学到的招数
You. Call for backup, or whateverabcthey told you to do at Quantico.

726
00:58:19,335 --> 00:58:21,670
守在门口 不要离开
You stay there by the door. You don't Ieave.

727
00:58:23,172 --> 00:58:24,423
去吧
Go.

728
00:58:24,507 --> 00:58:26,050
他也来吗
He comes, too?

729
00:58:26,133 --> 00:58:28,010
不 他留在门口 走吧
No, no, he stays at the door. Go on.

730
00:58:39,355 --> 00:58:44,276
很好 我最擅长的就是看门了
Perfect. Because I was first inabcmy class in door watching.

731
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:31,108
[talking in Russian]

732
00:59:31,198 --> 00:59:33,492
听说你在调查我
I hear you've been asking questions about me.

733
00:59:33,576 --> 00:59:35,661
你知道我的名字
You know my name.

734
00:59:35,745 --> 00:59:37,663
约翰
Johann.

735
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,866
[door closes]

736
00:59:41,709 --> 00:59:44,503
从墨西哥入境 聪明 很聪明
Coming in through Mexico, smart. Very smart.

737
00:59:44,587 --> 00:59:47,798
你怎么知道的 你是哪个部门的
How do you know this? What agency are you with?

738
00:59:47,882 --> 00:59:50,593
他们说你杀了参议员
They say you killed a Senator.

739
00:59:52,553 --> 00:59:54,680
他们认为你就是卡修斯
They think you're Cassius.

740
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:56,633
[whistles]

741
00:59:56,718 --> 01:00:00,137
Uh-oh.

742
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:01,680
[chuckles]

743
01:00:01,771 --> 01:00:03,814
你以为呢
What do you think?

744
01:00:03,898 --> 01:00:08,319
你以为我会傻到用自己的手机打电话？
You think I'm stupid enough to callabcahead from my own phone?

745
01:00:08,402 --> 01:00:11,989
你以为我在乎一个妓女的死活？
You think I give a damn what happens to some whore?

746
01:00:12,073 --> 01:00:15,826
是的 我以前扮演过卡修斯
Yes. I've played Cassius before.

747
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:20,664
如果他们希望我是卡修斯 那我就是卡修斯
If they want me to be Cassius, I become Cassius.

748
01:00:20,748 --> 01:00:22,625
可你不是
But you're not him.

749
01:00:25,419 --> 01:00:26,879
是吗
Really?

750
01:00:31,634 --> 01:00:33,302
你为何这么肯定
How can you be so sure?

751
01:00:35,763 --> 01:00:37,848
因为我是卡修斯
Because I'm Cassius.

752
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:52,397
[shooting]

753
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:55,484
[groans]

754
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:33,480
[clap of thunder]

755
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:40,404
[siren blaring]

756
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:42,864
[muffled voices]

757
01:01:47,001 --> 01:01:48,586
你当时在这里？
You were here?

758
01:01:48,669 --> 01:01:50,212
是的
Yes, sir.

759
01:01:53,841 --> 01:01:56,636
我立刻就跑到楼上
And I ran immediately upstairs.

760
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,839
[indistinct radio]

761
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:12,602
[dialing]

762
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:21,027
[telephone ringing]

763
01:02:38,052 --> 01:02:41,639
喂 奥利 你追捕过Moussali吧
Hey. OIIie. Come on. You did the workabcon the Moussali capture, right?

764
01:02:41,722 --> 01:02:44,642
用理论地理学查过他的行踪？
Applied some Iike theoretical geographyabcto his whereabouts?

765
01:02:44,725 --> 01:02:46,811
是的 追踪一名逃犯
Yeah, that's right. Tracking a fugitive...

766
01:02:46,894 --> 01:02:49,689
和追踪濒危物种差不多
is essentially the same thing as trackingabcan endangered species.

767
01:02:49,772 --> 01:02:51,983
排除其不可能去的地方
You rule out the places they can't or won't go...

768
01:02:52,066 --> 01:02:54,193
缩小到一些特定区域
until you have a reasonably few places to Iook.

769
01:02:54,277 --> 01:02:56,028
用你的理论调查这个案子吧 来
You want in on this thing? Come on.

770
01:02:57,905 --> 01:03:00,491
我要找什么
So, what is it I'm Iooking for?

771
01:03:00,575 --> 01:03:04,161
卡修斯后期的作案 杀的不只是亲苏联的人
Late in Cassius' career, his murdersabcwere no longer just pro-Soviet.

772
01:03:04,245 --> 01:03:05,997
也杀俄国人
He was killing Russians, too.

773
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:08,499
还有英国的 波兰的 捷克的 很多国家
And also English, Polish, Czech, you name it.

774
01:03:08,583 --> 01:03:10,167
这是什么时候的？
When was this?

775
01:03:10,251 --> 01:03:12,670
大约1988年
Around 1988.

776
01:03:12,753 --> 01:03:14,630
让人百思不得其解
It never made any sense.

777
01:03:16,924 --> 01:03:19,552
我好像遗漏了什么
I think I missed something here.

778
01:03:19,635 --> 01:03:21,721
你为何觉得遗漏了什么
Why do you think you missed something?

779
01:03:21,804 --> 01:03:23,848
你有什么新线索？
You have some new information?

780
01:03:23,931 --> 01:03:25,892
保罗・谢泼德森
Paul Shepherdson.

781
01:03:25,975 --> 01:03:28,477
怎么了
Yeah?

782
01:03:30,271 --> 01:03:31,647
什么
What?

783
01:03:33,608 --> 01:03:36,068
他在中情局干了25年
He's been at the company for Iike 25 years!

784
01:03:36,152 --> 01:03:38,529
我知道 所以才需要你调查
Yeah, I know, man. That's whyabcI need you on this. Okay?

785
01:03:38,613 --> 01:03:40,573
这些案卷我看过上千次了
I've been over this shit Iike a thousand times...

786
01:03:40,656 --> 01:03:43,034
熟悉的都看不出什么异常了
to the point at which I alwaysabcsee the exact same thing.

787
01:03:43,117 --> 01:03:45,870
你找出异常之处
Find something different.

788
01:03:48,497 --> 01:03:51,709
好的 好
Okay. Yeah, sure. I--

789
01:03:51,792 --> 01:03:55,588
如果你是对的 这意味着这么多年来
But if you're right, I mean, thatabcmeans the entire time...

790
01:03:55,671 --> 01:03:59,050
他一直在追踪自己？
he's been hunting himself?

791
01:03:59,133 --> 01:04:00,718
那么是他杀了参议员？
So, he killed the Senator?

792
01:04:00,801 --> 01:04:03,012
如果我们判断正确的话
If we're right about this, yeah.

793
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:08,051
[telephone rings]

794
01:04:08,142 --> 01:04:09,894
我是吉尔利特工
Agent Geary.

795
01:04:09,977 --> 01:04:11,771
有个案卷我有个疑问
I've got a question about a file here.

796
01:04:11,854 --> 01:04:14,065
是蓝色的案卷 夹着一张纸条 写着：
It's blue and it's got a note attached that says...

797
01:04:14,148 --> 01:04:15,942
"太多的疑点 不可能是卡修斯"
"Too many questions. Not Cassius."

798
01:04:16,025 --> 01:04:17,568
那个案子是恶作剧
Uh, No. That one's a hoax.

799
01:04:17,652 --> 01:04:20,112
是拙劣的模仿卡修斯的手法
It's like a crude copycat murder.

800
01:04:20,196 --> 01:04:21,572
那好 我就排除它
Okay, cool. I'll exclude it.

801
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:24,109
[squeaking]

802
01:04:28,496 --> 01:04:30,748
我去买咖啡 替你捎点什么吗
I'm gonna run for coffee. Want something?

803
01:04:30,831 --> 01:04:32,959
不用了 谢谢
Oh, no. I'm fine, thank you.

804
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,746
[door opens]

805
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:40,458
[door closes]

806
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:44,087
[soft music]

807
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:14,117
[grunts]

808
01:05:17,211 --> 01:05:18,796
噢
Ooh.

809
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,256
天
Jesus!

810
01:05:21,883 --> 01:05:24,177
保罗 嗨 谢谢你
Paul! Hi! Thank you!

811
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:25,636
你要小心点
You need to be careful.

812
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,471
我来
Yeah. Oh, Iet me--

813
01:05:27,555 --> 01:05:29,182
别下来
Stay up there. [clears throat]

814
01:05:29,265 --> 01:05:32,852
好
Okay.

815
01:05:32,935 --> 01:05:36,981
我希望你让你丈夫申请退出这个案子
I want you to tell your husband to ask off this case.

816
01:05:37,064 --> 01:05:40,485
让他说 这会给他本人和家庭带来危险
Have him say that it's just tooabcmuch for him, for his family.

817
01:05:40,568 --> 01:05:43,863
不管是什么理由 只要让他退出
What-whatever he has to say, just get him out.

818
01:05:43,946 --> 01:05:45,823
保罗 我能有什么办法
Paul, what do you expect me to do?

819
01:05:45,907 --> 01:05:48,034
我说过 我不能再照看他了
You know, I told you. I can't watch over him anymore.

820
01:05:48,117 --> 01:05:50,161
他已经很接近一个凶残的人
He's getting very close to a dangerous man.

821
01:05:50,244 --> 01:05:52,038
他不会听我的
He won't Iisten to me.

822
01:05:52,121 --> 01:05:53,998
我说什么他都不会听
He won't Iisten to anything I have to say, so--

823
01:05:54,081 --> 01:05:56,501
他会死的 娜塔莉
He's gonna die, Natalie!

824
01:05:56,584 --> 01:05:58,336
什么
What?

825
01:05:58,419 --> 01:05:59,962
你明白了吗
Do you hear me now?

826
01:06:02,089 --> 01:06:04,675
卡修斯曾经杀过
Cassius has taken out men...

827
01:06:04,759 --> 01:06:06,677
比吉尔利老练的多的人
much more experienced than Ben.

828
01:06:06,761 --> 01:06:09,847
对你和你的家人不会有丝毫怜悯之心
He doesn't give a damn about you, about your family.

829
01:06:09,931 --> 01:06:12,183
他会杀了你丈夫
He will kill your husband.

830
01:06:12,266 --> 01:06:14,143
不费吹灰之力
Like snapping his fingers.

831
01:06:25,321 --> 01:06:27,406
不会有丝毫内疚
And he will feel nothing.

832
01:06:43,798 --> 01:06:47,885
我把他每次作案的照片按照时间顺序排列起来
I pieced together the photos of every murderabcand I laid them out chronologically.

833
01:06:47,969 --> 01:06:50,221
这条红线之后
Oh, that red Iine right there indicates...

834
01:06:50,304 --> 01:06:52,765
他的作案就变得没有规律 难以解释了
where his killing became erratic and inexplicable.

835
01:06:52,849 --> 01:06:56,394
你只要设立一个虚假设 然后去证明
So, all you've gotta do is set up a nullabchypothesis and try and prove it.

836
01:06:56,477 --> 01:06:59,730
如果要证明不了 这说明你最初的假设肯定是对的
And when you can't prove it, that meansabcyour original hypothesis must be true.

837
01:06:59,814 --> 01:07:00,940
不明白
Wait, wait.

838
01:07:01,023 --> 01:07:03,234
举例来说
Take some fact.

839
01:07:03,317 --> 01:07:06,070
你说过你认为卡修斯会回到犯罪现场
You said you believe Cassius returnsabcto the scene of the crimes.

840
01:07:06,154 --> 01:07:08,239
你有每次作案的照片
And you've got photos of every murder.

841
01:07:08,322 --> 01:07:11,117
比如你假设霍金就是卡修斯
So set up a hypothesis of, say,abcStephen Hawking is Cassius...

842
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:14,745
那么同时也就有霍金不是卡修斯的虚假设
which gives you a null hypothesis ofabcStephen Hawking is not Cassius.

843
01:07:14,829 --> 01:07:17,248
你通过照片证明这个虚假设
So, go through the photos and try and prove the null...

844
01:07:17,331 --> 01:07:20,001
"滚雷"不是卡修斯
that Rolling Thunder is not Cassius.

845
01:07:20,084 --> 01:07:22,920
如果你能证明 说明你的假设是错的 如果不能
If you can, that means your hypothesisabcis incorrect. If you can't...

846
01:07:23,004 --> 01:07:24,964
那么根据你的P值
then depending on your "P" value of course...

847
01:07:25,047 --> 01:07:27,633
就能从统计学上证明你的假设肯定是对的
you've statistically proven yourabchypothesis must be true.

848
01:07:27,717 --> 01:07:30,762
或者霍金就是卡修斯
Or that Stephen Hawking is Cassius.

849
01:07:30,845 --> 01:07:32,972
是啊
Yeah.

850
01:07:33,055 --> 01:07:36,809
不是每个人都在逻辑统计学课上睡觉的
Some of us didn't sleep our way throughabcLogic and Stats at Harvard.

851
01:07:36,893 --> 01:07:38,978
这杯咖啡真管用

我为何没注意 保罗？

01:21:24,179 --> 01:21:26,431
我为何没注意？
How did I miss it?

923
01:21:26,514 --> 01:21:29,601
这么长时间 卡修斯就在我身边
The entire time, Cassius was right next to me!

924
01:21:29,684 --> 01:21:31,144
把枪放下 吉尔利
Put the gun down, Geary!

925
01:21:31,227 --> 01:21:33,146
难道我现在还能信任你吗
What? I'm supposed to trust you now?

926
01:21:33,229 --> 01:21:37,067
好 我们谈谈信任

So, how old were you when-whenabcyour family came over here?

934
01:22:00,257 --> 01:22:03,969
你也就十岁吧
What were you, about ten? Ten?

935
01:22:04,052 --> 01:22:07,305
你只能做个间谍吧？
You never had a choice, did you?

936
01:22:07,389 --> 01:22:09,683
你写了一篇论文 引起重视
So then you wrote a thesis that couldn't be ignored.

937
01:22:09,766 --> 01:22:12,018

The FBI came after you. They signed you up.

938
01:22:12,102 --> 01:22:15,146

You even started a family. You started a real family!

939
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:17,232
来掩人耳目
To make it stick.

940
01:22:21,111 --> 01:22:23,655
你就是个双面人
You've been a double your whole Iife.

941
01:22:28,034 --> 01:22:30,954
他们什么时候让你开始行动的？

942
01:22:34,332 --> 01:22:35,667
一年以前

943
01:22:37,502 --> 01:22:41,673
让我为新来的人扫清道路

944
01:22:47,596 --> 01:22:52,350
你割破参议员的喉咙 因为你知道你是专家
You cut the Senator's neck becauseabcyou knew you were the expert...

945
01:22:54,436 --> 01:22:57,397

who could convince the Americansabcit was Cassius who did it.

946
01:22:59,482 --> 01:23:03,361
然后把卡修斯调查出来
An investigation would flush Cassius out.

947
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:07,991
我收到的命令是杀了你

948
01:23:09,451 --> 01:23:11,203
然后回到莫斯科

949
01:23:11,286 --> 01:23:13,538
我坐今晚的航班走
My plane Ieaves tonight.

950
01:23:13,622 --> 01:23:15,582
一个人走？
Alone?

951
01:23:26,176 --> 01:23:28,178
那你会一直是这样的人
Then that's all you'll ever be.

952
01:23:38,355 --> 01:23:40,357
卡修斯

他不会交代 不会乖乖的

957
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:33,451
不会抓到活的
He's not gonna be taken alive.

拉开旋钮
Pull the knob.

这正是刀口的模式
Explains the cut pattern.

And when I turned around, I saw Paul going down.

977

But not before he'd gotten Cassius'abcown wire around his neck.

978
01:30:15,377 --> 01:30:17,838
卡修斯对保罗开的枪？
Cassius shot Paul?

979
01:30:21,049 --> 01:30:23,343
研究弹道可以证明
The ballistics will prove it.

980
01:30:27,931 --> 01:30:30,601
不过是在保罗抓住他以后

981
01:30:33,061 --> 01:30:34,354
是的
That's right.
