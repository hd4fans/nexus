你看  那是庄迈斯吗？
Hey, look. Is that Smith?

15
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:04,022
是他  没错  老练的水手
That's him, all right. The old sea dog.

16
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:07,234

Captain John Smith? I've heard amazing stories about him.

17
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,403
你要跟我们一块去远航吗？
Are you coming on this voyage, too?

18
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,573

Course he is, you half-wit! You can't fight Indians without John Smith!

19
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,578

That's right. I'm not about to let you boys have all the fun.

能把他救回来 真是感谢上帝
Thank heavens he's been successfully retrieved.

70
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,834
记你一功  迈斯 谢谢  大人
- Well done, Smith. - Thank you, sir.

71
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:15,172
别再大意了 不多久我们就到达新大陆
Don't lose heart, men. It won't be long before we reach the New World,

72
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:18,675
知道什么在等着我们吗？

and nothing, not wind nor rain,

76
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,689
还是上千万个蛮夷部族 都要勇往直前
nor a thousand bloodthirsty savages shall stand in our way.

77
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,566
坚持下去
Carry on, men!

78
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,487
真是振奋人心啊  大人
A stirring oration, sir.

79
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,406
现在大伙热血沸腾
I'm sure the men were most exhilarated!

80
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:47,579
但愿如此  我还得靠这些 愚蠢的人帮我挖金子呢  对吧？
Let us hope so. I'll need those witless peasants to dig up my gold, won't I?

81
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,042
哇  这新大陆可真不赖  迈斯
This New World's going to be great, John.

让我捧着大量黄金
I'm going to get a pile of gold,

83
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:58,507
回家盖大楼  要是蛮夷他们 敢来捣乱的话  我就给他一枪
build me a big house, and if any Indian tries to stop me, I'll blast him.

84
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,176
你尽管去照顾你的黄金 汤姆斯
Just worry about that fortune of yours, Thomas.

85
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:04,346
蛮夷交给我就行了 你是说蛮夷很难对付？
- Leave the savages to me. - You think they'll give us trouble?

86
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:07,474
庄迈斯会让他们吃苦头
Not as much trouble as Smith'll give them.

87
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,893
来一个我们就杀一个
We'll kill ourselves an injun

88

What do you suppose the New World will look like?

91
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,572
我觉得跟其他地方没什么两样
Like all the others, I suppose.

92
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,784
新大陆我以前见过不少了 汤姆斯

You'd better be all right, because I'm not coming in after you...

135
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:18,475

帮忙翻过来
Help me turn this thing over.

137

About the dream again? Have you figured it out yet?

140
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:54,052
其中一定有什么含意 我就是搞不懂
I know it means something, I just don't know what.

141
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:57,597
你应该去问问你爸爸 说得也是
- You should ask your father about it. - Maybe I should.

142
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,557
来吧  菲莉
Come on, Flit.

143
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,852
不要再疯了  我们该走了
Quit playing around. We have to get back.

144
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,525
就跟敌人决一死战
...faced a determined enemy.

145
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,444
那场仗打从太阳升起开始
The battle lasted from the rising of the sun

146
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,863
一直激战到夜幕低垂
until the evening shadows fell.

147
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:18,868
勇士们都奋勇杀敌 可就数高刚最英勇
Our warriors fought with courage, but none as bravely as Kocoum,

148
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,871
他就像猛虎出闸 所向匹敌
for he attacked with the fierce strength of the bear.

149
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:25,333
-他智勇双全  证明他是… -你看  高刚真的好帅哦
- He has proven himself to be... - He is so handsome!

150
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,710
他的笑容才迷人呢
I especially love the smile.

151
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,754
把敌人彻底歼灭
...destroying every enemy in his path.

152
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,507
今晚我们要为他庆祝
Tonight, we will feast in his honor.

153
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:38,805
乖女儿 爸
- My daughter. - Winggapo, Father.

154
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,516
看到你我就高兴了
Seeing you gives me greatjoy.

155
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,310
你能够平安回来 真是太好了
I'm so glad you've come home safely.

156
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,438
跟我来  我们要好好谈谈
Come with me. We have much to talk about.

157
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:50,149
我不在的时候 你都做了些什么？
I want to hear everything you've been doing.

158
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:58,700
爸  好多个晚上 我都在做同一个怪梦
Father, for many nights now, I've been having a very strange dream.

159
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:02,412
我想它是要告诉我 有一些兴奋的事将要发生了
It's telling me something's about to happen, something exciting.

160
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,915
没错 是有些兴奋的事情要发生了
Yes. Something exciting is about to happen.

161
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,209
真的  是什么？
Really? What is it?

162
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,921
高刚已经跟我开口向你提亲了
Kocoum has asked to seek your hand in marriage.

163
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,673
要嫁给高刚？
Marry Kocoum?

164
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,970
我告诉他  我是求之不得
I told him it would make my heart soar.

165
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:25,977
可是…他好古板哦
But he's so... serious.

166
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:29,105
乖女儿  高刚会是个好丈夫的
My daughter, Kocoum will make a fine husband.

167
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:33,067
他为人忠诚  坚强 绝对是个可托付终身的对象
He is loyal and strong and will build you a good house with sturdy walls.

168
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,653
嫁给他  你会很幸福的
With him, you will be safe from harm.

169
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,615
爸  我想我的梦 是在指示我另外一条路
Father, I think my dream is pointing me down another path.

170
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,325
这就是你要走的路啊
This is the right path for you.

171
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,327
我就不能选择吗？
But why can't I choose...

172
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,213
宝嘉康蒂  听我说
Pocahontas, come with me.

173
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,048
你身为酋长的女儿
You are the daughter of the chief.

174
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,634
是时候要建立在族人中的地位
It is time to take your place among our people.

175
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,388
就算是树高千丈 终究要落叶归根
Even the wild mountain stream must someday join the big river.

176
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:06,267
看着河水流过它
As the river cuts his path

177
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,521
黑夜强风也不怕
Though the river's proud and strong

178
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:15,193
弯弯曲曲任由它
He will choose the smoothest course

179
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,697
总有一天会到家
That's why rivers live so long.

180
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,575
它坚强
They're steady

181
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:26,871
不怕风吹和雨打
As the steady beating drum

182
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:30,041
这项链是你妈妈的嫁妆
Your mother wore this for our wedding.

183
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,503
她老盼望能看你戴着它出嫁
It was her dream to see you wear it at your own.

184
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:37,757
真配你
It suits you.

185
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,888
他要我稳定下来
He wants me to be steady.

186
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,516
落叶归根
Like the river.

187
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,689
可是我要长流不息
But it's not steady at all.

188
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,360
滚滚的河水是我所爱
What I love most about rivers is

189
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,445
它不停地向两岸拍
You can't step in the same river twice

190
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,739
它日夜不停流过逍遥自在
The water's always changing

191
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,616
它勇往直前  没有终点
Always flowing

192
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,535
努力付出代价
But people, I guess can't live like that

193
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,287
人们不停忙碌
We all must pay a price

194
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,957
可曾仔细想过
To be safe we lose our chance of ever knowing

195
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,877
流水弯弯哪里载
What's around the river bend

196
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,755
看着滚滚流水两岸拍
Waiting just around the river bend

197
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,383
仔细看着
I look once more

198
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,302
滚滚流水两岸拍
Just around the river bend

199
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,053
永不停息
Beyond the shore

200
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,763
看海鸥畅飞
Where the gulls fly free

201
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,890
飞往何方？
Don't know what for

202
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,101
可曾留下仔细看
What I dream the day might send

203
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:33,354
滚滚流水两岸拍
Just around the river bend

204
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,607
无尽
For me

205
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:41,195
永无止境
Coming for me

206
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:45,992
我无时无刻感觉到它 这里就是我的家
I feel it there beyond those trees Or right behind these waterfalls

207
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,495
它不停伴着鼓的敲打声音
Can I ignore that sound of distant drumming?

208
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,416
看那滚滚流水流往何方 你可曾想过
For a handsome, sturdy husband who builds handsome, sturdy walls

209
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:57,420
它暗示有些事情将会发生
And never dreams that something might be coming

210
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:01,215
滚滚流水两岸拍
Just around the river bend

211
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:04,927
流往何处不必猜

212
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,013
不眠不休
I look once more

213
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,681
滚滚流水两岸拍
Just around the river bend

214
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,600
永不停息
Beyond the shore

215
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,351
永远不停息
Somewhere past the sea

216
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,437
心在何方
Don't know what for

217
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,397
我的美梦向天飞
Why do all my dreams extend

218
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:20,276
滚滚流水两岸拍
Just around the river bend?

219
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:23,780
滚滚流水两岸拍
Just around the river bend

220
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,577
我该选择些什么
Should I choose the smoothest course

221
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:33,498
越想越会心事多
Steady as the beating drum?

222
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,627
如果我要嫁给他
Should I marry Kocoum?

223
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:42,548
一生梦想彷佛不再
Is all my dreaming at an end?

224
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:48,471
心在彷徨
Or do you still

225
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:53,893
该往何方看着
Wait for me, dream giver?

226
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:59,941
滚滚流水
Just around the river

227
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:05,446
两岸拍
Bend

228
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,558
是不是宝嘉康蒂呀？
Is that my Pocahontas?

229
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,687
柳树婆婆  我有话要跟你说
Grandmother Willow, I need to talk to you.

230
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:42,150
你早啊  我的孩子
Good morning, child.

231
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,819
我就是盼着你今天能来
I was hoping you'd visit today.

232
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,114
那是你妈妈的项链吧
Why, your mother's necklace!

233
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,825
我就是要来跟你说这个的
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

234
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:53,077
我爸爸想要我嫁给高刚
My father wants me to marry Kocoum.

235
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:56,664
高刚？可是他好古板
Kocoum? But he's so serious!

236
00:15:56,831 --> 00:16:00,543
就是嘛 可是爸爸认为这就是我的路
I know. My father thinks it's the right path for me.

237
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,671
但是…我老做一个梦 这个梦…
But lately, I've been having this dream, and I think it's...

238
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:08,217
噢  一个梦啊 那就赶快说出来听听啊
Oh, a dream! Let's hear all about it!

239
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,345
别吵
Quiet!

240
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,098
别吵

241
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,064
孩子  刚才你在说…
Now, child, you were saying?

242
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,734
我跑着穿过树林
Well, I'm running through the woods,

243
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,528
然后就在我面前有一支箭
and then right there in front of me is an arrow.

244
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,072
当我望向它  它就开始转动
As I look at it, it starts to spin.

245
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,826
一支转动的箭？那多不寻常啊
A spinning arrow? How unusual!

246
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:39,373
对  它不停地转  越转越快 越转越快  可是突然间  它停了
Yes, it spins faster and faster and faster... until, suddenly, it stops.

247
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:48,591
看来这转动的箭 似乎是在指引你往下要走的路
Well, it seems to me this spinning arrow is pointing you down your path.

248
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:51,886
可是柳树婆婆  是什么路啊？
But, Grandmother Willow, what is my path?

249
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:53,721
我要怎么样才能找到它呢？
How am I ever going to find it?

250
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:58,434
你妈妈也曾经问过我 同一个问题
Your mother asked me the very same question.

251
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,853
真的？那你怎么说的？
She did? What did you tell her?

252
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,856
我就叫她仔细听
I told her to listen.

253
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,859
在你的周围都是些神灵  孩子
All around you are spirits, child.

254
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:11,948
生活在土里  流水中  天空上
They live in the earth, the water, the sky.

255
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:16,035
只要细听就有指引
If you listen, they will guide you.

256
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,666
-我听见风 -对了
- I hear the wind. - Yes.

257
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,085
它在说些什么？
What is it telling you?

258
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:26,337
我听不太懂
I don't understand.

259
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,427
你会明白
You will understand

260
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,973
用心来聆听
Listen with your heart

261
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,559
心灵的声音
You will understand

262
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:47,149
让声音轻轻地告诉你人生真谛
Let it break upon you like a wave upon the sand

263
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,151
它在说有些什么要来
It's saying something's coming.

264
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,903
一团怪云？
Strange clouds?

265
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,282
用心来聆听
Listen with your heart

266
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:58,369
心灵的声音
You will understand

267
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,669
看见什么了？
What do you see?

268
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:11,382
云彩  一团怪云
Clouds. Strange clouds.

269
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:20,182
你看  华根 整个新大陆遍布黄金
Look at it, Wiggins, an entire New World chock-full of gold,

270
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,351
在等着我
Just waiting for me.

271
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:26,647
有更新鲜刺激的事 在等着我们呢  对吗？波斯
And scores of adventures waiting for us, right, Percy?

272
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,607
你说我们会碰上蛮夷吗？
Do you think we'll meet some savages?

273
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,694
真碰上 我们就好好地跟他打个招呼
Ifwe do, we shall be sure to give them a proper English greeting.

274
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,654
见面礼
Gift baskets!

275
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,366
难怪人们喜欢他不喜欢我
And he came so highly recommended.

276
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:43,706
太理想了  大人  海水深度正好 我们可以直接靠岸了
It's perfect, the water's deep enough. We can pull right up to shore.

277
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,374
嘿  那里  波斯
Hey, there, Percy.

278
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,378
好极了  船立刻靠岸 都安排好了  大人
- Very well, then. Give the order. - Already done, sir.

279
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,547
只等大人下令 随时可以出发了
I've got a crew assembled, and they're ready to go.

280
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,424
那些土著嘛
About the natives...

281
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:56,010
就看你的 千万别让那些蛮夷
I'm counting on you to make sure those filthy heathens

282
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:57,678
来坏我们的大事
don't disrupt our mission.

283
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,639
如果他们跟我以前 对付过的蛮夷一样的话
Well, if they're anything like the savages I've fought before,

284
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,141
那绝对没问题
it's nothing I can't handle.

285
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,311
好啊！那就没什么可担心的  迈斯
Right. That'll be all, Smith. There's a good man.

286
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,229
再见  波斯
See ya, Percy.

287
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,942
人们就是喜欢他
The men like Smith, don't they?

288
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:18,240
可我从来就不受欢迎 你有我呀
- I've never been a popular man. - I like you.

289
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:22,244
别以为我不知道那些人 在背后是怎么说我的
Don't think I don't know what those backstabbers at court say about me.

290
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,872
噢  对  都说您是个老拼命往上爬
Oh, yes, all that talk about being a pathetic social climber

291
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,541
可是却一事无成的可怜虫 我很清楚
- who's failed at everything... - I'm very well aware that this is

292
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:31,087
这次是我翻身的机会 你等着瞧  华根
my last chance for glory. But mark my words, Wiggins,

293
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,923
当詹姆国王看到那成堆的黄金
when King James sees the gold these peasants unearth,

294
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:37,760
这最后的胜利就是我的了
success will be mine, at last.

295
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,889
醒醒！伸个懒腰！ 在桁端的两个！
- Wake up! Shake a leg! - Two of you up on the yardarm!

296
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,557
简直是难以置信
It's incredible.

297
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:47,061
全都是我们的？ 我从来没见过这么好的地方
And it's all ours. I've never seen anything like it.

298
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:49,355
其实这个地方 像雷利夫的内裤  我也不在乎
It can look like Ratcliffe's knickers for all I care,

299
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,316
只要能离开这艘烂船
Just as long as I get off this stinking boat!

300
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:55,444
好了  兄弟们  我们老远地 跑来别站着看
Come on, men. We didn't come all this way just to look at it.

301
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:54,879
下船吧  伙伴们 用力  用劲  拉紧啊
Keep it taut, lads. Keep it taut! Steady! Steady!

302
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,756
抓牢  抓牢
Hold up! That's far enough!

303
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,258
就这样  绑牢它
All right now... tie her off!

304
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,093
庄哥  抓到这头
Here, John, tie off this end.

305
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,804
庄哥  庄哥？
John? John?

306
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,975
你爬上去干什么啊？ 想看清楚点
- What are you doing up there? - Getting a better look.

307
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,585
嘿！
Hey!

308
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,802
小东西  你样子长得很奇怪
Well... you're a strange looking fellow.

309
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,471
你饿了吗？
You hungry?

310
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,890
拿去吧  这是饼乾
Here you go. It's a biscuit.

311
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:50,684
食物  对！可以吃的哦
It's food. Well, sort of.

312
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,396
你喜欢啊
You like it, eh?

313
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,358
连吃四个月你就会知道了
Well, try eating it for four months straight.

314
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,906
你伙伴在后头啊
You got a friend back there?

315
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,044
嘿  什么？小心
Hey... what the... What...? Watch out.

316
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:22,591
别过来  小心！ 庄哥  快点下来！
- No... get that... Look out! - John, you better get down here!

317
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:26,595
总督大人要上岸了 好了  ！  改天再跟你玩  再见
- The governor's coming ashore. - All right. I'm leaving.

318
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:44,738
看到他们的皮肤吗？
Did you see their skin?

319
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:45,906
苍白  带病态
Pale and sickly.

320
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,449
他们脸上有毛  和狗一样
They have hair on their faces like dogs.

321
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:51,787
兄弟们 要先弄清楚他们的来路
My brothers, we must know more about these visitors.

322
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:54,957
纪克泰  看到什么了？
Kekata, what do you see?

323
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,809
他们非我族人
These are not men like us...

324
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:19,565
全是一些受体罚的怪兽
...but strange beasts with bodies that shine like the sun,

325
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:23,861
携带着会发出雷火的武器
and weapons that spout fire and thunder.

326
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:31,493
他们像群恶狼四处徘徊
They prowl the earth like ravenous wolves,

327
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,913
不停在寻找捕食的猎物
consuming everything in their path.

328
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:43,297
包华顿酋长 我这就带着族中勇士沿河道突击
Great Powhatan, I will lead our warriors to the river and attack.

329
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:47,343
杀他个措手不及 就像打败木索乌美族一样
We will destroy these invaders the way we destroyed the Massawomecks.

330
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:50,846
高刚  在那场仗中 我们对敌人了若指掌
Kocoum, in that battle we knew how to fight our enemy,

331
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:53,432
可是我们对这群来客 却一无所知
but these pale visitors are strange to us.

332
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,976
带些人去沿河道监视他们
Take some men to the river to observe them.

333
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,687
希望他们不过是路过而已
Let us hope they do not intend to stay.

334
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:03,651
我在此宣布 此地一切资源
I hereby claim this land and all its riches

335
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,111
尽归詹姆国王陛下所拥有
in the name of His Majesty, King James the First,

336
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:10,616
同时将此地命名为詹姆镇
and do so name this settlement Jamestown.

337
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:14,745
精彩  精彩 大人说得太精彩了
Bravo! Bravo! Beautifully spoken, sir!

338
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:16,205
快来  波斯
Hurry now, Percy.

339
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,791
快些弄干净见见新大陆了
We must be all squeaky clean for the New World.

340
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:05,838
庄上尉  看来我选的这个地方 再理想不过了
Captain Smith, it appears I've selected the perfect location.

341
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,214
看不见有蛮夷
Not a savage in sight.

342
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:10,092
只是我们没看到 不等于他们不存在
Just because we don't see them doesn't mean they're not out there.

343
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:15,723
也许你该去打探看看 他们究竟躲在何处
Then perhaps you should venture forth and determine their whereabouts.

344
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:18,892
如果真有蛮夷的话 包在我身上
If there are any Indians out there, I'll find them.

345
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:23,647
好了  朋友们  开工了
Now, gentlemen, to work.

346
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:26,525
你们去负责装卸 你们建跑垒
You men, get the ship unloaded, you men build the fort.

347
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:29,445
剩下的人拿圆锹出来
The rest of you... break out the shovels!

348
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:32,489
立刻开始挖地 挖地？
- It's time to start digging! - Digging?

349
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:35,743
当然了  别忘了那些西班牙人
Well, of course! Let's not forget what the Spanish found

350
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,036
在这儿找到了些什么
when they came to the New World.

351
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,081
黄金！  满山都是
Gold! Mountains of it.

352
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:44,793
多年来  这里的宝贵资源
Why, for years, they've been ravaging the New World

353
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,795
都是任由他们随便取用
of its most precious resources.

354
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,797
但现在…
But now...

355
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:52,676
轮到我们了
...it's our turn.

356
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:57,306
科尔特斯的黄金 皮泽洛的珠宝
The gold of Cortéz the jewels of Pizarro

357
00:25:57,473 --> 00:26:01,477
努力不会错 日子将会好过
Will seem like mere trinkets by this time tomorrow

358
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:05,230
这满地都是
The gold we find here will dwarfthem by far

359
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,400
金光闪闪
Oh, with all you got in ya, boys

360
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:12,362
像堆火
Dig up Virginia, boys

361
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,114
金色的美梦
Mine, boys

362
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,616
使我很激动
Mine every mountain

363
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:17,242
一分一秒
And dig, boys

364
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,952
绝不放弃
Dig till ya drop

365
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,871
闭上眼睛渴望
Grab a pick, boys

366
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:22,664
将来贫穷将离开
Quick, boys

367
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:23,999
赶快来动起手来  努力开
Shove in a shovel

368
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:28,545
赶快努力不放弃 财富数之不尽
Uncover those lovely pebbles that sparkle and shine

369
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,131
高人一等 与众不同
It's gold

370
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:35,552
一切都会属于我
And it's mine, mine, mine

371
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,930
挖  挖  大家一起挖
Dig and diggety dig

372
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:40,516
挖  挖  大家一起挖
And dig and dig and diggety dig

373
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,685

- Hey, nonny, nonny hi, nonny, nonny - Ooh, how I love it

374
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,814

- Hey, nonny, nonny, hi, nonny, nonny - Riches for cheap

375
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,025

- Hey, nonny, nonny, hi, nonny, nonny - There'll be heaps of it

376
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:54,905
看这富翁多可爱
- And I'll be on top of the heap - Diggety, diggety, diggety, dig!

377
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:58,200
努力不落空  目标快到达
My rivals back home it's not that I'm bitter

378
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:01,787
只要努力  总有一天金光散发
But think how they'll squirm when they see how I glitter

379
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:05,457
明天不一样  不管是真是假
The ladies at court will be all a-twitter

380
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,125
皇上要赏赐我
The king will reward me

381
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,754
称赞我  崇拜我
He'll knight me No! Lord me

382
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:14,842
是宝藏  张开眼睛就是宝藏
It's mine! Mine, mine for the taking

383
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,678
到处都是  努力挖土
It's mine, boys Mine me that gold

384
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:22,683
每人都崇拜我  依靠我
With those nuggets dug it's glory they'll give me

385
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:27,271
拥有尊贵  就要像个国王
My dear friend, King Jimmy will probably build me a shrine

386
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:30,941
当这一切
When all ofthe gold

387
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:32,442
都属于我
Is mine

挖  挖  大家努力地挖
And dig and dig and diggety dig

00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,031
挖  挖  大家努力地挖

390
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:43,287
用我一辈子努力 去寻找我梦想
All of my life I have searched for a land like this one

391
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:50,419
只要努力不放弃 理想终于会实现
A wild or more challenging country I couldn't design

392
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:56,925
不论再困难 我们提起勇气去面对
Hundreds of dangers await and I don't plan to miss one

393
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:01,054
踏破千山万水  征服这土地
In a land I can claim, a land I can tame

394
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:04,516
历经百险  充满刺激 努力不放弃
- The greatest adventure is mine - Keep on working, lads

395
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,435
争取一分钟
- Mine - Don't be shirking, lads

396
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:09,479
我的金矿
Mine, boys, mine

397
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:14,860
亮晶晶
Mine me that gold

398
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,613
美丽金矿
- Beautiful gold - Dig for that gold

399
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:21,575
当美梦来实现
Make this island my land

400
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:24,828
只要挖到宝不会觉得疲劳
Make the mounds big, boys I'd help you to dig, boys

401
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:27,039
再也不管腰酸背痛
But I've got this crick in me spine

402
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:30,542
这地是块宝
- This land we behold - This beauty untold

403
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:35,047
这话还算早
- A man can be bold - It all can be sold

404
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:38,550
富贵逼人来
So go for the gold

405
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,549

407
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:35,268
喂  你等一等  不要跑

00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:45,922
当声音轻轻地告诉你
Let it break upon you

417
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:50,510
人生真谛
Like a wave upon the sand

418
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,221
你是谁？
Who are you?

419

用心来聆听
Listen with your heart

不要停 应该就在这附近
Keep digging. It's got to be here somewhere.

427
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:32,177
山那边还有三十多个人 加起来超过一百
- There's 30 more down by the ridge. - That makes more than 100!

How long are we going to keep digging like this, sir?

430
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,437
当我们是奴隶啊 白天黑夜不停地挖
We're slaving away, busting our backs day and night...

431
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:45,065
为了国王跟国家

小狗狗乖不乖呀？
Who's a good doggie?

436
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,455
小狗狗乖不乖呀？

437
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:02,832

00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:23,979
向他们射
Them, you idiot!

444
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:37,617
那该死的庄迈斯 跑哪儿去了？
Where's that blasted Smith when I need him?

445
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,584

451
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:18,116
你呀 你的枪法该从头学
And you... learn to use that thing properly.

452
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:22,245
连枪都不会开  算什么男子汉
A man's not a man unless he knows how to shoot.

453
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:34,549
这些白人是侵略者 真恶毒
These beasts invade our shores, and now this.

454
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,846
这种伤我没见过
This wound is strange to me.

455
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:46,728
我们要对付敌人 可是绝对不能单独作战

我们要请他们来共同杀敌
We will call on our brothers to help us fight.

458
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,904
对付白人很危险
These white men are dangerous!

459
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,698
任何人不得接近他们
No one is to go near them.

460
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,120
这个叫头盔
It's called a helmet.

461
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,830
头盔？
Helmet.

462
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,543
这河叫什么？
So... what river is this?

463
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,295
库玉康纳克
Quiyoughcohannock.

464
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:15,215

- Meeko! - Well, how do you do, Meeko?

471
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,409

It's all right. It's just a handshake.

472
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:44,869

什么都没有啊
Nothing's happening.

474
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:51,042
当然没有事  把你的手伸给我
No, no. I need your hand first.

475
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:58,091
我们这是问好
It's how we say hello.

476
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:05,598
我们是这样子问好的
This is how we say hello. Winggapo.

477
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:11,061
Winggapo.

478
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:15,567
这样是说再见
And how we say goodbye. Anah.

479
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,445
我不要跟你说再见
I like hello better.

480
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,618
你少来好不好？
Yeah, I remember you.

481
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:30,874
菲莉不喜欢陌生人的 我们见过面  不陌生啊
- Flitjust doesn't like strangers. - But I'm not a stranger anymore.

482
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,293

指南针 指南针？

490
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,358
你迷路的时候会给你方向
It tells you how to find your way when you get lost.

491
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,652

It's all right. I'll get another in London.

492
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,529
伦敦？是你的部族吗？
London? Is that your village?

493
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,699
对啊  一个很大的部族 什么样子的啊？

街上到处都是马车

498
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:19,297
教你们族人 如何运用土地
We'll show your people how to use this land properly.

499
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,841
怎么样去物尽其用 物尽其用？
- How to make the most of it. - Make the most of it?

Yes. We'll build roads and decent houses...

501
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:27,055
我们的房子蛮好的啊
Our houses are fine.

502
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,974
只因为你从来没看过更好的
You think that only because you don't know any better.

503
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,520
你等一等
Wait a minute. Don't take it that...

504

嘿  等等
Hey! Wait!

505

怎么了？我们是一番好意
Wait! There's so much we can teach you.

506
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,570
好多蛮夷的生活 都由我们改善了
We've improved the lives of savages all over the world.

507
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:43,905
蛮夷？
Savages?

508
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:46,074
蛮夷不是说你
Not that you're a savage.

509
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:47,784
说我的族人？ 不是
- Just my people. - No.

510
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:50,828
你先不要误会 我不是这个意思
Listen, that's not what I meant. Let me explain.

511
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:54,207
让我走 不行  我不能放你走
- Let go! - No. I'm not letting you leave.

512
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,544
你别这样嘛
Look, don't do this.

513
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:01,172
蛮夷只是一个名词而已 你懂吗？
Savage is just a word, you know?

514
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,968
这是一个统称 那些还没有开发的人
A term for... people who are uncivilized.

515
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,135
像我
Like me.

516
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:10,139
对  不是  我不是这个意思
Well, when I say uncivilized, what I mean is...

517
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:23,361
你…你不要误会嘛
What you mean is... not like you.

518
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:26,656
你的意思是不像你
You think I'm an ignorant savage

519
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:29,158
尽管你到过很多地方
And you've been so many places

520
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,578
我是可以看得出来 猜得也不会错
I guess it must be so

521
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:34,247
但是我不明白
But still, I cannot see

522
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:37,625
怎么想都不明白
Ifthe savage one is me

523
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:43,590
你聪明 却有很多不知道
How can there be so much that you don't know

524
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:48,720
不知道
You don't know

525
00:39:56,769 --> 00:40:01,649
别以为 你已占有这块地方
You think you own whatever land you land on

526
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:06,195
你可曾知道这里有什么
The earth isjust a dead thing you can claim

527
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:10,700
可知道一块石头  一花一草
But I know every rock and tree and creature

528
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:15,371
有名字  有着灵气和生命
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name

529
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:19,959
别一厢情愿以为是人中人
You think the only people who are people

530
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:24,213
可知道天外还有天更高
Are the people who look and think like you

531
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:28,468
要尝试跟着别人脚步前往
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger

532
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:33,306
慢慢了解很多事情在当中
You'll learn things you never knew you never knew

533
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:38,311
你会感到黑夜孤单 份外寂寞吗？
Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon?

534
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:42,440
让春风柔柔轻抚做回答
Or ask the grinning bobcat why he grinned?

535
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:47,320
就让风声化做歌声围绕山头
Can you sing with all the voices ofthe mountain?

536
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:51,991
在风中染上色彩化做云烟
Can you paint with all the colors ofthe wind?

537
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:55,745
在风中染上色彩
Can you paint with all the colors

538
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:59,499
化做云烟
Ofthe wind?

539
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:10,343
在走进丛林不会觉得疲倦
Come run the hidden pine trails ofthe forest

540
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:14,597
来看看这大自然的果园
Come taste the sun-sweet berries ofthe earth

541
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:18,559
来享受一切丰富阳光资源
Come roll in all the riches all around you

542
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:23,106
这自然张开双手的怀抱
And for once, never wonder what they're worth

543
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:27,318
有河川山脉日夜跟我聚首
The rainstorm and the river are my brothers

544
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:31,989
水獭和飞鸟做我的朋友
The heron and the otter are my friends

545
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:35,994
但这些都让我们手牵着手
And we are all connected to each other

546
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,998
就在这里找到我们的源头
In a circle, in a hoop, that never ends

547
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:45,378
你猜树能长多高？
How high does the sycamore grow?

548
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:51,342
如果砍掉它  永远不知道
If you cut it down then you'll never know

549
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:57,724
你会感到黑夜孤单 份外寂寞吗？
And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon

550
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:01,811
让春风柔柔轻抚做回答
For whether we are white or copper-skinned

551
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:06,566
就让风声化做歌声围绕山头
We need to sing with all the voices ofthe mountain

552
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:11,571
在风中染上色彩化做云烟
We need to paint with all the colors ofthe wind

553
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:14,532
你会慢慢发觉到
You can own the earth, and still

554
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:18,244
你所拥有的一切
All you'll own is earth until

555
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:20,705
在风中
You can paint

556
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,833
染上色彩
With all the colors

557
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,754
化做
Ofthe

558
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:33,926
云烟
Wind

559
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:50,359
是什么啊？
What is it?

560
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:53,946
鼓声  出麻烦了
The drums. They mean trouble.

561
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,741
我该走了
I shouldn't be here.

562
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,701
什么时候可以再见你？ 不行啊
- I want to see you again. - I can't.

563
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:00,870
不要  不要走 很抱歉
- Please, don't leave. - I'm sorry.

564
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:06,167
我得走了
I have to go.

565
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:18,721
好了  这次差不多了
All right! This one's ready to hoist!

566
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:21,307
准备好  推
Two on each side. Ready now? Push!

567
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:23,101
小心点  有点滑
Watch it! It's slipping.

568
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:26,229
怎么了？伙伴们 一个小事都做不好
Come on, lads, it's only a little picket fence.

569
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:28,564
拉紧  拉紧 好了
- Steady! Steady! - There you go.

570
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:31,150
庄哥  这样就什么也进不来了
That'll keep everything out, eh, John?

571
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,655
你怎么了  庄哥？ 什么？
- Something wrong, John? - What?

572
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:40,743
这几天你总是一句话也不说 他先前没赶上那场热闹
- You've been quiet the last few days. - He's mad he missed all the action.

573
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:43,579
有什么好担心的  庄哥 一定会有机会让你对付他们
Don't worry, John. You'll get your chance to deal with the Indians.

574
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:47,333
是啊！到时候我们联手 叫他们吃不了  兜着走
Yeah. We'll take care of them, like we did last time, eh, mates?

575
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,961
来一个我们就杀一个
We shot ourselves an injun

576
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,879
来两个…
Or maybe two or three

577
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,507
别唱了  比杀猪还难听 干活去
All right, you howling nutter, get to work.

578
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:57,385
拜托！  阿宾  苦中作乐都不行啊
Come on, Ben. It's just a little fun.

579
00:43:57,552 --> 00:44:00,179
说得没错  我们是够苦了
Sure! We're having loads of fun, right?

580
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,181
你看看我们 既没金子  又没得吃
Look at us. No gold, no food,

581
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:06,727
所有的好处  全让那个死胖子 雷利夫  一个人占尽了
while Ratcliffe sits up in his tent all day, happy as a clam.

582
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,188
怎么搞的？
I'm doomed!

583
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:13,276
这时候我应该坐拥万金啊 却连金沙都找不到
I should be wallowing in riches by now, and I haven't found as much as a speck.

584
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:18,239
想一想  想一想 一定就藏在这附近
Think. Think! It's got to be around here somewhere.

585
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,200
究竟在哪？
Where could it be?

586
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:28,207
我已经把这附近的地方 统统挖过了  都没有
I've mined the forests and the hills and the swamps... and nothing!

587
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:34,297
怎么会没有？我漏掉了什么？
Why can't I find it? What am I overlooking?

588
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:39,677
我…我自己做的
I... I... I made it myself!

589
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:41,679
把它给我拿下来
Take that silly...

590
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:44,765
对了  印第安鬼
Of course. The Indians.

591
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:48,352
华根  你说印第安鬼 为什么要来袭击我们？
Wiggins, why do you think those insolent heathens attacked us?

592
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,772
因为我们侵入他们的领土 还有砍树挖地吗？
We invaded their land, cut down their trees and dug up their earth?

593
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:56,527
是黄金  是他们故意把黄金 藏起来不让我们找到
It's the gold! They have it, and they don't want us to take it from them.

594
00:44:56,694 --> 00:45:00,239
那就只有逼我动用武力去抢
Well, I'll just have to take it by force then, won't I?

595
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:05,077
你们  庄上尉哪儿去了？
You there! Where's Captain Smith?

596
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:09,749
他…走了 对  他早就被你吓跑了
- Well, he's... gone. - Aye. Your singing scared him off.

597
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:13,294
那就找他去  站在这儿干嘛 要是碰到印第安鬼该怎么办？
- Go get him, for heaven's sake! - What ifwe run into the Indians?

598
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:16,255
难道就不会用你的枪吗？
That's what guns are for.

599
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,424
带上家伙立刻出发
Now arm yourselves and get moving!

600
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,826
宝嘉康蒂
Pocahontas.

601
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:48,829
你应该留在部族里的
You should be inside the village.

602
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,331
我们正忙着呢
We'll be all right.

603
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:53,668
勇士们快要到了 我们在准备粮食
We're gathering food for when the warriors arrive.

604
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:54,877
别走远
Don't go far.

605
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:58,381
这种时刻可不能再乱跑了 知道了  爸
- Now is not the time to be running off. - Yes, Father.

606
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:04,095
看你挂上这条项链 就跟你妈一个模样
When I see you wear that necklace, you lookjust like your mother.

607
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,597
我好想她哦
I miss her.

608
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,891
她仍然伴着我们
But she is still with us.

609
00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:13,312
每当风吹过树林 我都感觉得到她的存在
Whenever the wind moves through the trees, I feel her presence.

610
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:16,190
她是我们族人 智慧和力量的象征
Our people look to her for wisdom and strength.

611
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:18,985
将来他们要看你的
Someday, they will look to you as well.

612
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,778
我不会让他们失望的
I would be honored by that.

613
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,698
你不该单独在这里
You shouldn't be out here alone.

614
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:27,243
我叫高刚来 好了  是什么？
- I'll send for Kocoum. - All right, what is it?

615
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:28,869
什么？ 你心里头有鬼
- What? - You're hiding something.

616
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,871
我哪里有什么鬼呀
I'm not hiding anything.

617
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:33,040
宝嘉康蒂  你告诉我  我保证
Pocahontas, you can tell me. I promise.

618
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:37,211
我绝对不会告诉别人的 宝嘉康蒂  你看
I won't tell anyone... Pocahontas, look!

619
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:44,218
是个白人！我要去通知… 你来这儿干什么？
- It's one of them! I'm going to get... - What are you doing here?

620
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:46,262
我要来看你呀
I had to see you again.

621
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:51,392
宝嘉康蒂  宝嘉康蒂 拜托  你什么都别说
- Pocahontas! Pocahontas! - Please! Don't say anything.

622
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:52,893
快！跟我来！
Quick! This way!

623
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,645
可是… 尼可曼
- But... - Nakoma.

624
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:59,108
宝嘉康蒂人呢？ 我…我没看见她
- Where is Pocahontas? - I haven't seen her.

625
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:04,238
她不能老是到处乱跑 这样子是非常危险的
Pocahontas can't keep running off. It's dangerous out there.

626
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:07,491
劝劝她  她都听你的
Tell her that. She listens to you.

627
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,746
哼  她才不呢
Sure she does.

628
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:29,930
真是世外桃源
This place is incredible.

629
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:33,225
可是我们那班人 只是想着来挖黄金
And to think we came all this way Just to dig it up for gold.

630
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,144
黄金？ 嗨  米糕
- Gold? - Hey, Meeko.

631
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:39,106
什么黄金啊？ 黄金就是黄黄的
- What's gold? - You know, it's yellow.

632
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:41,317
从地下出来  很值钱的
It comes out of the ground. It's really valuable.

633
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,277
在这儿  我们有好多哦
Here, we have lots of it.

634
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,613
黄金
Gold.

635
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:49,950
不是这个  这个才是  黄金
No, no! Gold is this.

636
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,119
这里没有这种东西
There's nothing like that around here.

637
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,955
没有？ 我没见过
- No gold? - Not that I've seen.

638
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,625
如果他们知道
All this way for nothing.

639
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:00,461
这里没有黄金的话 一定很失望
Those boys are in for a big surprise.

640
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:02,880
他们会走吗？ 有些会吧
- Will they leave? - Some of them might.

641
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,425
你也回家？
Will you go home?

642
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:09,887
我一向是到处流浪  四海为家
Well, it's not like I have much of a home to go back to.

643
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:12,306
回不回去也无所谓
I've never really belonged anywhere.

644
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,809
那你留下来
You could belong here.

645
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:25,402
这是什么？
What was that?

646
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:29,782
你看见什么了？ 没有  没有  我只是…
- Did you see something? - No, no. I just...

647
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:32,868
我真的没有看到东西 怎么了？
I didn't see anything. Did I?

648
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,703
再看哪
Look again.

649
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:38,707
让声音轻轻地告诉你
Let it break upon you

650
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:43,546
人生真谛
Like a wave upon the sand

651
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:47,299
你好  庄迈斯
Hello, John Smith.

652
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:50,302
宝嘉康蒂  树在跟我说话？
Pocahontas, that tree is talking to me.

653
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,429
那你快回话啊
Then you should talk back.

654
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,473
不要怕呀  小伙子
Don't be frightened, young man.

655
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,184
我可不会咬人的
My bark is worse than my bite.

656
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:02,273
说话呀 跟树要说什么？
- Say something. - What do you say to a tree?

657
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,859
什么都可以
Anything you want.

658
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:12,116
好啊  你好 走过来  庄迈斯
- So... - Come closer, John Smith.

659
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:17,621
他心肠挺好的  长得好帅呀
He has a good soul. And he's handsome, too!

660
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,958
我喜欢她 我知道你会
- Oh, I like her. - I knew you would.

661
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:24,545
迈斯  迈斯  你在哪儿啊？
Smith! Smith, where are you, mate?

662
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:27,214
不要让他们看到 快  到这儿来
- We can't let them see us. - Quick! Over here.

663
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:31,093
这个地方好吓人啊 那些蛮夷可能就躲在附近
This place gives me the creeps. Savages could be hiding anywhere.

664
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:35,473
怕什么 让我看见  二话不说开枪
If you spot one, don't ask questions. Just shoot.

665
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:41,187
你干什么绊我啊？ 不是我  是那棵树
- Watch your feet, you big oaf! - It wasn't me! It was the tree.

666
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:44,857
是啊  是那棵树抬起脚 把我给绊倒的
Of course! The tree just felt like lifting its roots...

667
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,653
我们快离开这儿吧
Let's get out of here.

668
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:54,158
快跑 那庄迈斯怎么办呢？
- Run! - But what about Smith?

669
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:57,077
别管他了  他会照顾自己的
He's a big lad, he can take care of himself!

670
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:58,412
还好没有跟你作对
I'm glad you're on our side.

671
00:49:58,579 --> 00:50:01,540
这几条老筋还挺管用的呢
There's still some snap in these old vines.

672
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:04,376
我先回去了 不然他们会全部出来找我
I better get back before they send the whole camp after me.

673
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:08,339
什么时候再见啊？ 今天晚上  在这儿
- When will I see you again? - Meet me tonight, right here.

674
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:18,224
哇  这两百年来 都没碰过这么兴奋的事情
Well! I haven't had this much excitement in 200 years.

675
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:21,435
我是怎么了？ 我不应该再跟他见面的
What am I doing? I shouldn't be seeing him again.

676
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:23,437
可是我实在想见到他
I mean, I want to see him again.

677
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:26,565
就是嘛！我也想再见到他
Who wouldn't? I want to see him again.

678
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:30,569
我觉得好像 有些什么在告诉我  这是对的
But, still, something inside is telling me it's the right thing.

679
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,279
也许是你的梦
Perhaps it's your dream.

680
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:37,535
我的梦？柳树婆婆  你说那支箭 所指的会不会就是他？
My dream? Do you think he's the one the spinning arrow was pointing to?

681
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:48,379
勇士们来了
The warriors are here.

682
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:02,768
宝嘉康蒂  你疯了 跟那个白人混在一起
Pocahontas, are you crazy? What were you doing with one of them?

683
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:04,228
你在这儿 高刚
- There you are! - Kocoum!

684
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:08,482
你看看  现在人强马壮 一定能把白鬼赶尽杀绝
Look at them! Now we have enough warriors to destroy those white demons!

685
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:14,780
团结起各部族的力量 我们一定能打败敌人
Now that we are joined by our brothers, we will defeat this enemy.

686
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,081
爸  我有话要跟你说
Father, I need to speak with you.

687
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:26,834
现在不行  乖女儿 联盟正在集会
Not now, my daughter. The council is gathering.

688
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:30,337
不一定非要开战啊 一定有更好的方法
We don't have to fight them. There must be a better way.

689
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:33,132
这个时候 已经由不得我们选择了
Sometimes our paths are chosen for us.

690
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:35,843
也许你该去跟他们谈一谈
But maybe we should try talking to them.

691
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,428
他们不会想谈的
They do not want to talk.

692
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:41,265
如果他们真的愿意谈呢？ 你会听他们说吗？你会吗？
But if one of them did want to talk, you would listen to him, wouldn't you?

693
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:43,350
宝嘉康蒂 你会吗？
- Pocahontas... - Wouldn't you?

694
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:47,688
我当然会了 但怎么会那么简单
Of course I would, but it is not that simple.

695
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:50,357
事情已经不再单纯了
Nothing is simple anymore.

696
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:36,528
慢着  汤姆斯  是我
Easy, Thomas, it's me.

697
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:42,034
庄哥  我差点就开枪了 你根本没有瞄准目标
- Oh, John! I could've killed you. - Not aiming like that, you couldn't.

698
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:45,245
开枪的时候两眼睁开 才看得更清楚
Keep both eyes open when you shoot. You'll see twice as well.

699
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:50,125
迈斯  回来了 我们一直在到处找你
- Smith! There you are. - We were looking all over for you.

700
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:53,420
迈斯  你跑哪儿去了？
Smith! Where have you been?

701
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:56,131
大人  我到周围查看一下而已
I was out scouting the terrain, sir.

702
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:58,675
很好  那你一定 对印第安鬼了若指掌了
Excellent. Then you must know the Indians' whereabouts.

703
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,761
要开战就该知己知彼
We'll need that information for the battle.

704
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:03,180
开战？ 我们一定要把这些蛮夷
- What battle? - We will eliminate these savages

705
00:53:03,347 --> 00:53:06,141
赶尽杀绝 不行  你不能这样做
- once and for all. - No! You can't do that!

706
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:11,688
噢  不能？ 对  我们用不着打他们
- Oh, can't I? - Look. We don't have to fight them.

707
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,732
庄哥  这什么意思？ 我遇上他们
- John, what's gotten into you? - I met one of them.

708
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,110
什么？ 遇上蛮夷了？
- You what? - A savage?

709
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:18,946
他们不是蛮夷  他们能帮助我们
They're not savages. They can help us.

710
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:22,533
他们熟悉土地 懂得如何测定河道
They know the land. They know how to navigate the rivers.

711
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:25,661
你看  是粮食 这是什么东西？
- And look. It's food. - What is it?

712
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:27,955
比饼乾跟燕麦粥好吃多了
It's better than hardtack and gruel, that's for sure.

713
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:29,123
燕麦粥好
I like gruel.

714
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,834
他们才不会要请客吃饭
They don't want to feed us, you ninnies!

715
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,294
他们要杀人  杀我们
They want to kill us! All of us!

716
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:37,423
为了独霸黄金 他们用上好多诡计
They've got our gold, and they'll do anything to keep it!

717
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:41,093
这里根本就没有黄金 没有黄金？
- But there is no gold. - No gold?

718
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:45,305
我看是你的那位 印第安朋友告诉你的吧？
And I suppose your little Indian friend told you this?

719
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:46,807
是的
Yes.

720
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:50,561
撒谎  撒谎  全都撒谎 凶险的小偷
Lies. Lies! All of it! Murderous thieves.

721
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:52,771
我们文明社会 不容许这种贼存在
There's no room for their kind in civilized society.

722
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:54,231
可是这里是他们的土地！
But this is their land!

723
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:57,651
这里是我的  我就是法律
This is my land! I make the laws here.

724
00:53:57,818 --> 00:54:01,989
听清楚  要是任何一个人 见到印第安鬼
And I say anyone who so much as looks at an Indian

725
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:07,494
而不杀他的话 就等于是造反  要问罪
without killing him on sight will be tried for treason and hanged.

726
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:13,834
宝嘉康蒂
Pocahontas!

727
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:15,669
尼可曼 不要再去了
- Nakoma. - Don't go out there.

728
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:19,089
我已经为你撒过谎 你不能一错再错啊
I lied for you once, don't ask me to do it again.

729
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:20,674
我一定要去
I have to do this.

730
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:22,885
他是白人 你不了解
- He's one of them! - You don't know him.

731
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:25,846
你去见他 就等于背叛自己的族人
If you go out there, you'll be turning your back on your own people.

732
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:28,307
我这么做是要帮助我的族人
I'm trying to help my people.

733
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:31,602
宝嘉康蒂  不要去 你是我的好朋友
Pocahontas, please, you're my best friend.

734
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,395
我不要你受到伤害
I don't want you to get hurt.

735
00:54:33,562 --> 00:54:37,441
放心  我不会有事的 宝嘉康蒂  不要！
- I won't. I know what I'm doing. - Pocahontas, no!

736
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:46,867
雷利夫 不会真叫我们空手而回吧
Ratcliffe wouldn't take us halfway around the world for nothing.

737
00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:50,329
如果迈斯是对的 如果这里真的是没有黄金
But what if Smith is right? What if there is no gold?

738
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:53,624
你是说雷利夫一直在欺骗我们
If you ask me, Ratcliffe's been lying to us since we left London.

739
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,626
瞧你说的  你们这群笨蛋
Listen to you, you bunch of idiots.

740
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:58,128
如果什么都没有 那些蛮夷才不会攻击我们
Those savages didn't attack us for nothing.

741
00:54:58,295 --> 00:54:59,880
他们一定藏着一些东西
They're hiding something.

742
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:03,383
要是真的有黄金 我们就得跟他们拼命了
If they do have the gold, I reckon we'll have to fight them.

743
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,053
我不会  我才不会冒着危险… 不是太热就是太冷
- Not me. I'm not risking my neck... - Either too hot or too cold.

744
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:08,722
自从来了这里 我就一直感到不安
I haven't been comfortable since we got here.

745
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:12,392
我也觉得浑身不自在
Me, too. I'm itching a lot.

746
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:21,860
跟踪他 是  总督大人
- Follow him. - Yes, Governor.

747
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:24,321
我要知道他究竟去哪里？
I want to know where he's sneaking off to.

748
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:27,491
是  大人 如果遇见印第安鬼
- Yes, sir. - If you happen to see any Indians...

749
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:29,993
就开枪
...shoot them.

750
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:36,375
还有  汤姆斯 你无论当水手
And, Thomas, you've been a slipshod sailor

751
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:38,919
和军人的表现都不怎么样
and a poor excuse for a soldier.

752
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:41,380
别再叫我失望了
Don't disappoint me again.

753
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,642
高刚 什么事？
- Kocoum. - What is it?

754
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:58,355
宝嘉康蒂她… 怎么了？她怎么了？
- It's Pocahontas. - What's wrong? Is she all right?

755
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:02,317
我想她遇上了麻烦
I think she's in trouble.

756
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:09,950
大地在发抖啊  孩子 出了什么事了？
The earth is trembling, child. What's happened?

757
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:11,451
勇士们都来了
The warriors are here.

758
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:13,579
宝嘉康蒂 迈斯
- Pocahontas. - John!

759
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:18,542
你听我说 我们的人正准备攻打你们
Listen to me. My men are planning to attack your people.

760
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:19,710
你们一定要小心
You've got to warn them.

761
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:22,004
也许现在还来得及阻止他
Maybe it's not too late to stop this.

762
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:24,214
你得要跟我去和我爸爸谈一谈
You have to come with me and talk to my father.

763
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,925
宝嘉康蒂 我看谈也是于事无补的
Pocahontas, talking isn't going to do any good.

764
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:28,760
我已经跟我的人谈过了
I already tried talking to my men,

765
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,221
他们简直就是无药可救
but everything about this land has them spooked.

766
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:38,020
我从来没有见过那样的怪物
That's the strangest creature I've ever seen!

767
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,817
波斯？
Percy?

768
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,906
放松  波斯！过来 米糕  回来
- Easy, Percy! Come here! - Meeko, come back!

769
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:51,742
你都看到了  两边如果拼上了 怎么能挡得住呢？
You see what I mean? Once two sides want to fight, nothing can stop them.

770
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:55,078
好了  你们两个 没事  他是朋友
- Come here, both of you! - It's all right. He's a friend.

771
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:56,413
坏坏狗  给我坐下
Bad! Bad dog! Sit!

772
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:01,376
米糕  你在干什么？ 波斯  不要再闹了
- What are you doing? Meeko! - Percy, get back here!

773
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:05,547
你在干什么？停啊 够了  我受够了
- What are you doing? Stop that! - All right, that's enough!

774
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:14,973
这就够让你们筋疲力尽了
It's enough to make your sap boil.

775
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:20,729
现在我要让你们看些东西  看啊
Now then, there's something I want to show you. Look!

776
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:28,028
是涟漪 什么意思？
- The ripples. - What about them?

777
00:57:28,195 --> 00:57:32,741
开始小小的  然后越来越大
So small at first, then look how they grow.

778
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:36,787
可得要有人先开始哦
But someone has to start them.

779
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:38,956
他们是不会听我们的了
They're not going to listen to us.

780
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:43,335
小伙子 正确的路都是不容易走的
Young man, sometimes the right path is not the easiest one.

781
00:57:43,502 --> 00:57:45,170
知道吗？
Don't you see?

782
00:57:45,337 --> 00:57:49,633
你们要在一起 就一定要他们停战
Only when the fighting stops can you be together.

783
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:56,264
好吧  我们去见你爸爸
All right. Let's go talk to your father.

784
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:34,761
高刚  不要！
Kocoum, no!

785
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:42,978
高刚
Kocoum!

786
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:47,357
你放开他
Leave him alone!

787
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,876
高刚  住手
Kocoum, stop!

788
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:10,338
两眼睁开
Both eyes open.

789
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:21,308
汤姆斯 中了…
- Thomas! - Is he...

790
00:59:21,475 --> 00:59:23,226
你杀了他
You killed him.

791
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,228
我以为… 走开  你走开
- I thought that... - Get away from him!

792
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,481
宝嘉康蒂  不要 他只是想…
Pocahontas, it won't help! He was only...

793
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:28,648
他杀了他
He killed him!

794
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:31,984
Get all the wagons...

795
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:35,739
汤姆斯  快点离开 快点走啊
Thomas, get out of here! Get out of here!

796
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:40,846
是谁干的？
Who did this?

797
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:42,973
宝嘉康蒂跑到树林里
Pocahontas was out in the woods.

798
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:46,059
高刚跟去找她 这个白人袭击他
Kocoum went to find her and this white man attacked them.

799
01:00:47,853 --> 01:00:52,899
你的武器很厉害 可是敌不上我们的愤怒
Your weapons are strong, but now our anger is stronger.

800
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:56,486
到日出时刻  第一个先处决他 可是爸…
- At sunrise, he'll be the first to die! - But Father!

801
01:00:57,154 --> 01:01:00,031
我叫你留在部族里头
I told you to stay in the village.

802
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:02,033
你就是不听
You disobeyed me.

803
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:05,829
你让你爸爸丢脸 我只是想要帮助大家
- You have shamed your father! - I was only trying to help.

804
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:09,916
就因为你的无知 高刚牺牲了
Because of your foolishness, Kocoum is dead!

805
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:11,877
把他带走
Take him away!

806
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:28,643
高刚全是为了要保护我
Kocoum was just coming to protect me.

807
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:32,731
宝嘉康蒂 是我要高刚去的
Pocahontas... I sent Kocoum after you.

808
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:36,735
我实在很担心你
I was worried about you.

809
01:01:36,902 --> 01:01:39,029
我以为我这样做是对的
I thought I was doing the right thing.

810
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:42,032
所有的事都因我而起
All this happened because of me.

811
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:45,285
我再也不能够见到庄迈斯了
And now I'll never see John Smith again.

812
01:01:47,454 --> 01:01:49,080
跟我来
Come with me.

813
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:57,714
宝嘉康蒂她想要亲自审问 那个杀掉高刚的人
Pocahontas wants to look into the eyes of the man who killed Kocoum.

814
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,135
要快点
Be quick.

815
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:22,155
宝嘉康蒂
Pocahontas.

816
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:28,119
我很抱歉 为什么？这个啊？
- I'm so sorry. - For what? This?

817
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:30,622
我受过比这个还重的伤
I've gotten out of worse scrapes than this.

818
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:32,249
现在可想不起来
Can't think of any right now, but...

819
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:34,251
如果我们从没遇到过多好
It would've been better ifwe'd never met.

820
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:38,713
什么都不会发生了 宝嘉康蒂  你看着我
- None of this would've happened. - Pocahontas, look at me.

821
01:02:39,798 --> 01:02:44,552
我情愿明天死掉 也不要长命百岁而不认识你
I'd rather die tomorrow than live a hundred years without knowing you.

822
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:48,640
宝嘉康蒂 我不能没有你
- Pocahontas. - I can't leave you.

823
01:02:48,807 --> 01:02:50,183
绝对不会
You never will.

824
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:55,063
无论我发生什么事 我都与你同在  直到永远
No matter what happens to me, I'll always be with you. Forever.

825
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:11,454
快呀  大家快来呀
Help! Somebody help! Help!

826
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:13,206
快呀 你别急呀  兄弟  有什么事啊？
- Help! - Easy, lad. What is it?

827
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:14,874
是庄迈斯  他被抓了
It's Smith! They got him!

828
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:17,210
被谁抓了？ 蛮夷！
- Who got him? - The savages!

829
01:03:17,377 --> 01:03:19,087
蛮夷？ 把他绑起来  带走了
- Savages? - They captured him! Dragged him off!

830
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:20,880
往哪儿去了？ 往北边去了
- Where'd they take him? - They headed north.

831
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:23,091
有多少人啊？ 不清楚  起码十几个
- How many were there? - I don't know. At least a dozen.

832
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:25,385
肮脏的野兽！
Filthy beasts!

833
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:29,347
这当然是对的  华根 我这是得来全不费功夫
It's perfect, Wiggins! I couldn't have planned this better myself.

834
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:32,392
黄金全是我的了
The gold is as good as mine.

835
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:35,228
把他救回来 不能丢下他不管啊
We've got to save him! He'd do the same for any of us.

836
01:03:35,395 --> 01:03:37,731
他说得对  我们一定要去救他
Thomas is right! We've got to do something.

837
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:42,569
那当然了  我早就说 蛮夷是绝对不可以相信的
And so we shall. I told you those savages couldn't be trusted.

838
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:45,947
庄迈斯相信他们 他们是怎么对他的？
Smith tried to befriend them, and look what they've done to him!

839
01:03:46,406 --> 01:03:49,909
我们一定要尽全力 把我们的好兄弟救回来
But now I say it's time to rescue our courageous comrade.

840
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:52,287
天一亮  我们就出击！
At daybreak, we attack!

841
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:57,125
你怎么会知道 会遇到这一群人？
What can you expect from filthy little heathens?

842
01:03:57,292 --> 01:04:00,378
全都是令人恶心的家伙
Here's what you get when races are diverse

843
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:02,213
看他们的颜色
Their skin's a hellish red

844
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:03,840
像火一般炽热
They're only good when dead

845
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:06,426
是邪恶魔鬼的化身
They're vermin as I said and worse

846
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:09,346
是野蛮人  野蛮人
They're savages, savages

847
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:12,515
野蛮不讲道理 野蛮人  野蛮人
- Barely even human - Savages, savages

848
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:14,267
把他赶走吧
Drive them from our shore!

849
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:15,935
他们不像我们
They're not like you and me

850
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:17,729
野蛮又不讲道理
Which means they must be evil

851
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:20,607
我们要提高警惕
We must sound the drums ofwar

852
01:04:20,774 --> 01:04:22,734
是野蛮人  野蛮人
They're savages, savages

853
01:04:22,901 --> 01:04:24,611
野蛮不讲道理
Dirty, shrieking devils

854
01:04:24,778 --> 01:04:28,573
我们用心来对抗
Now we sound the drums ofwar

855
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:34,871
你可曾知道
This is what we feared

856
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:36,748
贪得无厌的欲望
The paleface is a demon

857
01:04:36,915 --> 01:04:39,793
是他们与生俱来的本性
The only thing they feel at all is greed

858
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:41,628
外表虽然好看
Beneath that milky hide

859
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:43,338
其实邪恶丑陋
There's emptiness inside

860
01:04:43,505 --> 01:04:46,299
他们无理又像野兽
I wonder ifthey even bleed

861
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:48,635
是野蛮人  野蛮人
They're savages, savages

862
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:50,303
野蛮不讲道理
Barely even human

863
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:52,055
野蛮人  野蛮人
Savages, savages

864
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:53,389
要小心提防
Killers at the core

865
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:55,225
用尽一切方法
They're different from us

866
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:57,310
把他赶出这地方
Which means they can't be trusted

867
01:04:57,477 --> 01:05:00,271
绝不会让他好过
We must sound the drums ofwar

868
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:02,315
是野蛮人  野蛮人
They're savages, savages

869
01:05:02,482 --> 01:05:04,067
野蛮不讲道理
First we deal with this one

870
01:05:04,234 --> 01:05:05,819
让我们点燃战火
Then we sound the drums ofwar

871
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:07,320
野蛮人  野蛮人
Savages, savages

872
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:09,155
杀他个片甲不留
Let's go get a few, men!

873
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:10,907
野蛮人  野蛮人
Savages, savages

874
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:12,659
一个也不漏
Now it's up to you, men!

875
01:05:12,826 --> 01:05:14,411
野蛮人 野蛮人
- Savages - Savages

876
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:16,162
我们毫不害怕
Barely even human

877
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:19,666
让我们
Now we sound the drums

878
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:24,879
跟他们战斗
Ofwar

879
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:34,389
柳树婆婆  太阳出来 他们就要杀掉他了
They're going to kill him at sunrise, Grandmother Willow.

880
01:05:34,556 --> 01:05:36,015
你一定要阻止他们
You have to stop them.

881
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:39,686
我不行 孩子  记住你的梦吗？
- I can't. - Child, remember your dream.

882
01:05:39,853 --> 01:05:43,565
我是错的  柳树婆婆 我是走错了路
I was wrong, Grandmother Willow. I followed the wrong path.

883
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:45,900
我该怎么办呢？
I feel so lost.

884
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:05,128
指南针
The compass.

885
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:15,346
会转动的箭
The spinning arrow.

886
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:17,682
他就是你梦中的箭啊
It's the arrow from your dream!

887
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:21,019
没错  箭头就是指向他
I was right. It was pointing to him!

888
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:30,403
日出 现在还不太迟  孩子！
- Sunrise. - It's not too late, child!

889
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:34,240
让大地的神灵给你指引
Let the spirits of the earth guide you!

890
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:40,163
让你知道该走的路 孩子  走下去
You know your path, child. Now follow it!

891
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,251
今天要发威
This will be the day

892
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:47,587
勇往直前
Let's go, men!

893
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:50,924
看谁也不怕谁
This will be the morning

894
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:52,926
把犯人带出来
Bring out the prisoner!

895
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:55,386
我要他们战死在沙场
We will see them dying in the dust

896
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:56,763
不知我能做什么？
I don't know what I can do

897
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:58,681
多我一个不嫌多
Still I know I've got to try

898
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:00,391
叫他把命赔
Now we make them pay

899
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:02,060
正义站在我这方
Eagle, help my feet to fly

900
01:07:02,227 --> 01:07:03,603
谁也不怕谁
Now, without a warning

901
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:05,521
一定会平安渡过
Mountain, help my heart be great

902
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:07,065
多少英雄战死在沙场
Now we leave them blood and bone and rust

903
01:07:07,232 --> 01:07:10,944
回家大门为我开 多少  牺牲
- Spirits ofthe earth and sky - It's them or us

904
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:13,571
打铁趁热要赶快
Please don't let it be too late

905
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:16,032
肮脏的野蛮人
They're a bunch of filthy, stinking savages

906
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:17,367
野蛮人 白鬼
- Savages - Demons

907
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:18,534
恶魔 杀吧
- Devils - Kill them!

908
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,078
野蛮人 野蛮人
- Savages - Savages

909
01:07:20,245 --> 01:07:21,579
你们在等什么？
What are we waiting for?

910
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:25,250
作战不眠不休 来杀个片甲不留
Destroy their evil race until there's not a trace left

911
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:30,964
谁来点起这战火
How loud are the drums ofwar?

912
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:35,301
看谁最勇敢
Now we see what comes oftrying to be chums

913
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:40,765
不畏缩  不害怕 快快来迎接
Is the death of all I love carried in the drumming of

914
01:07:40,932 --> 01:07:42,141
这战火 不  ！
- War - No!

915
01:07:46,145 --> 01:07:49,440
如果你要杀他 得把我一起杀掉
If you kill him, you'll have to kill me too.

916
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:51,818
女儿  退下去
Daughter, stand back.

917
01:07:51,985 --> 01:07:55,947
我不要  爸  我爱他
I won't! I love him, Father.

918
01:08:01,828 --> 01:08:03,579
你自己看看
Look around you.

919
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:07,000
是仇恨带我们走上这条路的
This is where the path of hatred has brought us.

920
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:12,088
我选择了自己的路  爸
This is the path I choose, Father.

921
01:08:12,255 --> 01:08:13,756
你会怎么选呢？
What will yours be?

922
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:52,378
我女儿说的话 超越她年龄的智慧
My daughter speaks with a wisdom beyond her years.

923
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:55,715
我们内心都带着愤怒而来
We have all come here with anger in our hearts,

924
01:08:55,882 --> 01:08:58,968
而她所带着的是勇气和谅解
but she comes with courage and understanding.

925
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:04,015
从今天开始 如果再有杀戮的事情
From this day forward, if there is to be more killing,

926
01:09:04,182 --> 01:09:06,351
一切都与我无关
it will not start with me.

927
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:10,897
放了他
Release him.

928
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:31,084
是时候了  开火
Now is our chance! Fire!

929
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,044
不 什么？
- No. - What?

930
01:09:33,211 --> 01:09:35,755
他们已经放人了 他们不想打了
- They let him go! - They don't want to fight!

931
01:09:35,922 --> 01:09:39,092
这是诡计  知道吗？开火！
It's a trick, don't you see? Fire!

932
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,807
开火  好  我亲自出马
Fine! I'll settle this myself.

933
01:09:48,393 --> 01:09:49,435
不要
No!

934
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:51,979
庄哥
John!

935
01:09:57,944 --> 01:09:58,945
你射他
You shot him!

936
01:09:59,112 --> 01:10:02,615
是他自己跑过去的 是他不对呀
He stepped right into it! It's his own fault!

937
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:05,284
庄迈斯一直都是对的 我们根本就不该听你的
- Smith was right all along. - We never should've listened to you.

938
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:07,537
拿起枪！ 造反了  ！
- Get the gun! - Traitors!

939
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,706
放开我  你们胆大包天！
Unhand me, I say. How dare you!

940
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:11,624
把他铐起来！
Put him in chains!

941
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:14,210
我会拿你们问罪
I'll see you all hanged for this!

942
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:16,045
把他的嘴堵住
And gag him as well!

943
01:10:28,349 --> 01:10:29,851
他熬得过去吗  汤姆斯？
Is he going to make it, Thomas?

944
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:31,811
最好赶快把送他回伦敦
The sooner he gets to England, the better.

945
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:33,646
但愿一切平安顺利
Let's hope the wind is with him.

946
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:36,149
船准备好了吗？ 随时都能启航
- Is the ship ready yet? - Any minute now.

947
01:10:36,315 --> 01:10:38,943
现在就等最后几件货装上去
Just loading the last bit of cargo.

948
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:46,492
放开我 你们不怕杀头啊？
Untie me at once! I'll have your head for this!

949
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:49,829
人们总是对他推崇备至
And he came so highly recommended.

950
01:10:58,796 --> 01:11:00,506
船随时能启航
The ship's almost ready.

951
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:03,301
得先把你抬上船 要赶上涨潮
We'd better get you on board. We'll lose the tide.

952
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:06,846
不要  等一等 她说她会来的
No, not yet. She said she'd be here.

953
01:11:07,889 --> 01:11:09,265
来了
Look.

954
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:37,710
回伦敦是他唯一的机会
Going back is his only chance.

955
01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:40,379
要不然他的命就保不住了
He'll die if he stays here.

956
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:50,556
给
Here.

957
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:53,059
这是柳树婆婆树上的树皮
It's from Grandmother Willow's bark.

958
01:11:53,226 --> 01:11:55,061
能减轻痛苦
It'll help with the pain.

959
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:58,481
什么痛苦？ 还有比这个更痛的
What pain? I've had worse pain than this.

960
01:12:00,066 --> 01:12:01,567
只要看到你就好了
Can't think of any right now, but...

961
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:11,410
我跟我的族人永远欢迎你

谢谢  好兄弟
Thank you, my brother.

963

964

我妈的项链
My mother's necklace.

965
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:35,518
谢谢了  波斯
See ya, Percy.

966
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:54,287
跟我走吧
Come with me?

967
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:01,252
你要选定你自己的路
You must choose your own path.

968
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:18,686
这里需要我
I'm needed here.

969
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:22,732

970

保重了  迈斯 顺风  庄哥
- Good luck, lad. - Godspeed, John.

975
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:13,699
一切就位了吗？ 是  大人

976
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:15,785
