1
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:14,206
不 不 安静
No, no. Just be quiet.

2
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,307
该死
Shit.

3
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:18,577
该死 该死 该死
Shit. Shit. Shit.

4
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:21,780
你他妈给我回来！
Get the fuck back here!

5
00:01:21,782 --> 00:01:24,116
嘿，把那个该死的相机给我！
Hey, give me that fucking camera!

6
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,263
是的，你在看我发给你的视频？
Yeah, so you're watching that footage I sent?

7
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,099
是的，我在找，儿子，而你…
Yeah, I'm looking, son, and you...

8
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:42,468
也许你已经猜到了，是你的妻子雇我去干的
so as you probably guessed, your wife hired me to get that.

9
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,137
问题是如果我把这个给她看，她会不付我钱
The problem is if I show it to her, she stops paying me.

10
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:47,506
所以我在想你也许想还个价
So I was thinking you might want to make a counter-offer there.

11
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:49,541
哦，不管你想出多少价钱
Oh, and whatever number you come up with,

12
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:53,312
你最少要给我300块作为损坏我车的赔偿
you can put 300 bucks on top for the dent you put in my car.

13
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:55,681
好吧，反正是你刮掉的油漆
Well, you scratched the paint anyway.

14
00:01:55,683 --> 00:01:57,649
你听好了，如果我明天没收到你的信息
You know what, if I don't hear from you by tomorrow,

15
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,585
你老婆就会得到那份文件 再见
your wife gets that file. Good-bye.

16
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:02,521
那么 现在的协议是什么？
So what's the deal now?

17
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:04,523
啊，也许一无所获 只是这个女人
Ah, probably nothing. Just this woman thinks

18
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:07,326
认为他的儿子失踪了
her son is missing.

19
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:08,393
他一个星期没去上课了
He hasn't been to class in a week.

20
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:10,229
他也不接她的电话
He won't answer her calls.

21
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:12,764
他很可能昏倒在一堆啤酒罐中
He's probably passed out in a pile of beer cans.

22
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:15,167
在这种情况下 我们要带孩子开车旅行
In which case we're gonna take the kid on a road trip

23
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:16,635
来获得一些费用，因为我们
and rack up some expenses, 'cause we're getting

24
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,203
处理这件事情期间每天能获得1000块
1,000 bucks a day on this one.

25
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:21,607
在这里左转
Turn left up here.

26
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:23,675
你的纽扣相机在工作么？
Your button cam's working?

27
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:26,512
是的，它在工作
Yeah, it's working.

28
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:31,850
是这里么？
This is it?

29
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:34,820
是的
Yeah.

30
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:37,689
这里看上去不像是谁的家
It doesn't look like anyone's home.

31
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:39,525
她没给你一把钥匙么？
She couldn't give you a key?

32
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:41,793
她没有她说了
She doesn't have one. She said the lock

33
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,328
后窗户的锁是坏的
on the back window's busted,

34
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,630
也许我们能从那儿进去
so maybe we can get in that way.

35
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:46,498
那警察还没来过这里么？
And the cops haven't been here?

36
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,567
没有，警灿谠于这些大学生失踪几天的事情
No, the cops don't give a shit about some college kid

37
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:49,935
一点也不在乎
who's missing for a couple days.

38
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:54,540
这里
Here.

39
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,683
那里面有人么？
Is there someone in there?

40
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,886
过来，快点，给我相机
Here. Come on, give me the cam.

41
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,897
里面什么也没有
There's nothing there.

42
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:21,667
我确定那里有该死的声音 听起来像是有人在里面
It sure as fuck sounded like there's something there.

43
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:23,535
这是一栋老房子
It's an old house.

44
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,970
而且，如果有人在里面
Besides, if there is somebody in there,

45
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:28,707
我倒想和他们谈谈
I'm gonna want to talk to 'em.

46
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,909
接着
Here.

47
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,565
你没事吧？
You all right?

48
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,968
还好
Just great.

49
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,237
你还好么？
You okay?

50
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:52,758
怎么了？
What?

51
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,426
你知道么？呆在这里，好么？
You know what? Stay in here, okay?

52
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:56,528
我要去检查一下这间公寓的其他地方
I'm gonna go check the rest of this apartment

53
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,563
确定一下这里没有其他人，好么？
and make sure no one else is in here, okay?

54
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,832
你带你的枪了么?是的
You got your gun? Yeah.

55
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:03,502
好的，很好只要… 只要，额
All right, good. Just... just, um,

56
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:05,871
把任何相关的东西都拖到车上好么？
pull anything relevant onto that drive. Okay?

57
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:07,639
并且全部记录
And record everything.

58
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,074
这是协议的一部分她希望我这么做
That was part of the deal. She likes me to do that.

59
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:10,909
好吧，你拿着我的照相机呢.
Well, you took my camera.

60
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:15,414
哦.那么…
Oh. Then...

61
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,316
好吧，我很快会回来
All right, so I'll be right back.

62
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:18,984
只是，额… 只是，我不知道
Just, um... just, I don't know,

63
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,552
看看那台电脑上有什么，好么？
see what's on that computer, okay?

64
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:21,853
如果那是加密的，我们就把它带回家
If it's encrypted, we can take it home.

65
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,355
如果不是，那就尽你可能的复制资料
If not, just pull what you can.

66
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:25,424
知道了
Got it.

67
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:53,452
露出她的乳头！
Show her tits!

68
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,518
我找到了一个新的
I found a new one.

69
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,088
从质量上来看是第二或者第四代
It's third or fourth generation from the quality.

70
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,691
我从一些家伙那里得到的 他们从小亚美尼亚
I got it from some guy down in little Armenia

71
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:35,026
的一个当铺下载的
with a pawn shop.

72
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,928
他绝不是你通常看到的那种
He is definitely not the type of guy you usually see

73
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,631
和我们交易的人，但我认为他是
on here trading with us, but I think he's somebody

74
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,700
值得再次探查的
who's worth checking in on again.

75
00:06:56,482 --> 00:07:00,152
好吧这真实太奇怪了
Okay. That's fucking weird.

76
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,790
他的大部分收藏品，我想说
Most of his collection, I would say,

77
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:06,758
是鼻烟和卡值，但是他至少
was snuff and cp, but he had at least one

78
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,727
有一样东西是真实的
that was the real thing.

79
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,429
我甚至不觉得他知道那是什么
I don't even think he knew what it was.

80
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:12,831
总之… 
Anyway...

81
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:30,175
一点点的发红，有些刺激物
A little bit of redness, some irritation,

82
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,644
但是它看上去还好  感觉如何？
but it looks okay. How's it working?

83
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:35,146
很好是的，我能看到
It's good. Yeah, I can see,

84
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:36,581
但是我的另一只眼睛如何？
but what about my other eye?

85
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:40,252
- 跟着我的手看  - 好的
- Follow.            - Okay.

86
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:42,787
你从眼中看不到任何东西？
You can't see anything out of your biological eye?

87
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,723
看不到
No.

88
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:49,561
好吧那现在呢？
Okay. How about now?

89
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:51,263
是的，我是说，稍微好一点儿了
Yeah. I mean, it's a little better.

90
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:53,698
只是有些模糊和朦胧
It's just kind of blurry and shadowy.

91
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,801
是的 好的
Yeah. All right.

92
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:58,837
好吧，因为你的假眼球是直接连到
Well, because your prosthesis is attached directly

93
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,739
你的视觉皮层的
to your visual cortex,

94
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:03,241
你的的真眼睛 本质上与你的相机眼睛相斗争
you real eye's essentially battling with your camera eye

95
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:05,143
来向你传送实时的景象
to give you input right now.

96
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:06,912
因此当你的大脑开始习惯有那个芯片时
So when your brain gets used to having that chip in there,

97
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:08,246
你要开始试着越来越
you should start to see more and more

98
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:09,781
不用你未受伤的眼睛来看东西
out of your uninjured eye again.

99
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:12,817
到那时，你可能会看到一些假信号
Until then, you might see some glitches.

100
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:14,753
你说的假信号是什么意思？
What do you mean by glitches?

101
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,254
额，这个现在还处在测试中
Well, this is just being tested now.

102
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:19,758
像你这样的眼部伤害是很罕见的
Eye injuries like yours are quite rare.

103
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,060
所以这就是为什么我们安装了一个录音芯片
So that's why we've installed a recording chip

104
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,896
植入了眼睛里 那样我们就可以测试接收到的数据
into the eye itself so we can test the data it's receiving.

105
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,831
是这样是的，关于那个
Right. Yeah, about that.

106
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,167
- 怎么了？  - 哦，我的上帝
- Yes?            - Oh, my God.

107
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:32,203
那么如果我想要私人空间，我该怎么做？
So if I want private time, what do I do?

108
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:35,040
我怎么关闭它？好吧，你不能
How do I turn this off? Well, you can't.

109
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:36,908
但是 这只是对于试用期
But that's just for this trial period.

110
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,644
你不能指望KPG公司
You can't expect the KPG corporation to just

111
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:43,615
只给你植入这个而不期望测试它的数据
give you this implant and not expect to test its data.

112
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:45,083
当然不能
Of course not.

113
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,218
所以你们准备围坐在那里，看我拉屎么？
So you guys are gonna sit around and watch me take shits?

114
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,722
我想说这是一个公平的让步 米德尔顿先生
I'd say that's a fair compromise, Mr. Middleton.

115
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:52,357
你可以在那期间看一份报纸，或者其他的
You can read a newspaper during, or something.

116
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,227
那么预约下周
So make an appointment for next week.

117
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:57,662
我们将看看它运转如何
We'll see how it's working.

118
00:09:57,664 --> 00:09:59,264
如果你有任何问题打电话给我
Call me if you have any concerns.

119
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,799
好的谢谢你
All right. Thank you.

120
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:14,646
这到底怎么回事？
What the hell?

121
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,069
好的，先生 好吧
All right, man. All right.

122
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:39,371
你确定你没事儿，伙计？
You sure you gonna be okay, bud?

123
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:40,905
是的，伙计 我没事 我很好
Yeah, dude, I'm good. I'm good.

124
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,207
如果你有什么需要的就给我留言
Give me a shout if you need anything.

125
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:44,275
回头见
See ya.

126
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,409
怎么回事？
What the fuck?

127
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:54,879
我把那个控制器放哪儿了？
Where'd I put that controller?

128
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,152
好吧，然后
All righty, then.

129
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,857
怎么… 
What the...

130
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,897
好吧
okay.

131
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:40,859
这他妈什么情况？有人么？
What the fuck? Hello?

132
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:49,467
有人么？哦，拜托
Hello? Oh, come on.

133
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:52,771
这他妈是什么？
What the fuck is this shit?

134
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,888
哦，该死
Oh, shit.

135
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,090
上帝啊！该死！
Jesus! Fuck!

136
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:19,831
哦，该死
Oh, shit.

137
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,472
是的 是的 我能分辨出
Yeah. Yeah, I can tell the difference

138
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:31,309
一束光和一个该死的血腥人的区别，好么？
between a burst of light and a fucking bloody person, okay?

139
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,979
我不知道，你告诉我 你是医生
I don't know, you tell me. You're the doctor.

140
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:38,183
听着，我明天去你那儿，你要帮我
Look, I'm coming in there tomorrow, and you're gonna fix

141
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:41,085
修理这个该死的东西，还有刚才那个东西，好么？
this fucking thing, and that's that, okay?

142
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:45,056
好吧 好的，谢谢你
Fine. All right, thank you.

143
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:24,028
听到么？
Hello?

144
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,497
有人在下面么？
Is somebody down there?

145
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:29,334
认真点，别惹我
Seriously, don't fuck with me.

146
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:31,469
哦，上帝该死
Oh, God damn it.

147
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:34,873
有人么？
Hello?

148
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,378
该死！
Shit!

149
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:48,286
哦，妈的
Oh, fuck.

150
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:51,022
这他妈是什么？
What the fuck?

151
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:06,271
有人么？
Hello?

152
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:08,539
该死！嗯，好吧！
Shit! Uh, okay!

153
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:11,309
我很好 谢谢你，你可以走
I'm good. Thank you, you can go.

154
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:13,678
哦，该死！
Oh, shit!

155
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,316
哦，该死！
Oh, fuck!

156
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:32,063
哦，我的上帝
Oh, my God.

157
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:52,717
该死的
God damn it.

158
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,328
哦，该死
Oh, shit.

159
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:45,770
哦，该死
Oh, shit.

160
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:02,153
嘿，你在那里么？
Hey, are you in there?

161
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:06,724
听着，我能通过窥视孔看到你
Look, I can see you through the peephole.

162
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:09,160
你昨天不是在医生的办公室么？
Weren't you at the doctor's office yesterday?

163
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:11,362
是的
Yeah.

164
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,499
好的，那么交易什么？你在跟踪我？
Okay, so what's the deal? Are you following me?

165
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:19,570
我没跟踪你，听着，只要打开门
I'm not following you. Look, just open the door.

166
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:22,306
好的，听着，我无意冒犯
All right, listen, I don't mean to be rude,

167
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:23,741
可是这事很奇怪，你知道么？
but it's kind of weird, you know?

168
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:25,743
你看，你看到了奇怪的东西？
Look, are you seeing weird stuff?

169
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:28,479
看上去像是个死人的家伙？
Like people who look dead?

170
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:31,749
你真的应该打开门
You should really open the door.

171
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,691
谢谢你 我叫克拉丽莎
Thank you. I'm Clarissa.

172
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:43,628
是的，进来吧
Yeah, come on in.

173
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,564
- 这地方很不错，先生  - 谢谢
- Nice place, man.     - Thanks.

174
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,366
你有啤酒么？
Do you have any beer?

175
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,401
我有 是的
I do. Yes.

176
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,770
止痛片如何？医生给你了一些没？
What about painkillers? Did the doctor give you any?

177
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:55,306
没有，其实我没有任何疼痛
No, I'm not actually in any pain.

178
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:57,308
我只要喝杯啤酒
I'll just take a beer then.

179
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,545
听着，克拉丽莎，我真的准备离开这里
Look, Clarissa, I'm actually on my way out of here.

180
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:02,146
伙计，如果你不听完我要说的
Dude, you're not gonna get anywhere

181
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:03,614
那你哪儿也别想去
if you don't hear what I have to say.

182
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:06,317
只是给我来杯啤酒，给你自己也来一杯
Just give me a beer, get one for yourself.

183
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:09,387
你会需要它的
You're gonna need it.

184
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:11,656
好吧
Right.

185
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,567
- 谢谢  - 当然
- Thanks. - Sure.

186
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:25,403
我出身就是聋子
I was born deaf.

187
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:27,438
当我16岁是，我的父母带我去
When I was 16, my parents put me up

188
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,241
植入了一个新的人工耳蜗
for a new cochlear implant.

189
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:32,877
显然，它很奏效
It worked, obviously.

190
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:34,512
但是是我开始能够分辨出
But I began to be able to pick up

191
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:38,182
我环境中的某些频率
certain frequencies in my environments.

192
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:40,785
你的眼睛出什么事儿的？
What happened to your eye anyway?

193
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:46,190
我以前，额… 再一次车祸中
I was in a, um... in a car accident.

194
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:49,427
那么那个小女孩是谁？
So who's the little girl?

195
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:50,761
什么小女孩？
What little girl?

196
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,563
这里有个小女孩
There's a little girl here.

197
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:57,368
我进来的时候听到了她的哭声
I heard her crying when I came in.

198
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,637
但是你知道…
But you know...

199
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:03,674
我现在听不到她了
I don't hear her now.

200
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:06,310
有些人永远也听不到或者看到他们
Some people never hear them or see them.

201
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,312
也许在他们一生中会有一次
Maybe once in their entire lives,

202
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,248
如果他们打开它
if they're open to it.

203
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:15,620
所以当你可以感觉到他们时，他们知道
So when you can sense them, they know.

204
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:18,156
他们可以交流
They can tell.

205
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:22,727
这就是为什么我想找到你来提醒你
That's why I wanted to find you. To warn you.

206
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:26,197
提醒我什么？
Warn me about what?

207
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:28,366
是的
Yeah.

208
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:29,834
你与他们的互动越多
The more you interact with them,

209
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:33,571
他们就越能触碰你
the more they can touch you,

210
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:37,341
伤害你
hurt you, stuff.

211
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,277
好吧，明天我要把这个该死的东西
Well, tomorrow I'm gonna get this fuckin' thing

212
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:41,512
从我的头里弄出来，那样就行了，对么？
taken out of my head, and that'll be that, right?

213
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,247
别那么肯定
Don't be so sure.

214
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:46,350
你以前有伤害过某人么？
Have you ever done anything bad to anybody?

215
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,519
听着，如果你把植入的芯片取出来
Look, if you get the implant taken out,

216
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,521
他们仍然会在那里
they're still gonna be there.

217
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,890
你只是不能看到他们
You're just not gonna be able to see them.

218
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:55,893
我不知道，也许那样会好些
I don't know, maybe that's better.

219
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:59,330
好吧，我猜哦，该死！
Well, I guess. Oh, shit!

220
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:01,265
嗯，我现在不想吓你
Um, I don't want to alarm you right now,

221
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:03,601
但是有一个该死的恐怖的家伙正站在你背后
but there's a fucking creepy dude standing right behind you.

222
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:06,270
我知道我能听见他
I know. I can hear him.

223
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:09,607
- 你认识他或者其他的？  - 他是我的叔叔
- Do you know him or something? - He was my Uncle.

224
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:12,243
哦，当然，是的我的意思是…
Oh, of course, right. I mean...

225
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:14,979
好吧，我不是故意叫他恐怖的家伙，但是我的意思是… 
well, I didn't mean to call him creepy, but I mean...

226
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:16,747
他是一个好人
he wasn't a nice person.

227
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:20,685
好吧…
Okay...

228
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:23,287
听着，我知道怎么让他离开
Listen, I know how to make him go away.

229
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:24,922
只要盯着我看好吧
Just focus on me. Okay.

230
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:26,924
哦！
Oh!

231
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:31,362
哦，该死
Oh, shit.

232
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:35,499
别，别看他，看我
No, don't look at him, look at me.

233
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:53,684
哦，该死
Oh, shit.

234
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,972
好吧，你个混蛋科学家
All right, you scientist assholes,

235
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:16,974
我要那个画面的副本
I want a copy of that footage.

236
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:18,809
同样的，我要你把它刻入一个碟里或者诸如此类的东西
Like, I want you to put it on a disc or something,

237
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:20,978
但是是别看它
but don't watch it.

238
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,815
只要把它给我，好么？
Just get it to me, okay?

239
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:27,551
好的
All right.

240
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,992
哦，该死
Oh, fuck.

241
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:40,765
哦，该死的
Oh, God damn it.

242
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:45,403
克拉丽莎… 是你么？
Clarissa... Is that you?

243
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:48,539
嘿
Hey.

244
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:51,008
哦，该死！
Oh, shit!

245
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,582
嘿
Hey.

246
00:21:58,584 --> 00:22:01,319
哦，上帝
Oh, God.

247
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,924
哦，该死
Oh, shit.

248
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:17,401
这他妈是什么？
What the fuck?

249
00:22:23,076 --> 00:22:26,577
克拉丽莎，把你的手给我！
Clarissa, give me your hand!

250
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:28,646
妈的
Fuck.

251
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,785
我抓住你了 我抓住你了
I got you. I got you.

252
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:44,121
哦，该死！
Oh, fuck!

253
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:56,834
哦… 哦… 哦… 
Oh...Oh...Oh...Oh...

254
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:05,776
好的
All right.

255
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:09,747
你要离开这里，你个傻瓜
You're coming out of here, you fucker.

256
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,085
额… 哦，我不能看这个该死的
Eww...Oh, I can't look at this shit.

257
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:18,689
哦，上帝
Oh, God.

258
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:22,159
好吧
Okay.

259
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:59,263
哦，该死！
Oh, shit!

260
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:26,023
拉里拉里
Larry. Larry!

261
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,228
嘿，声音小点儿 什么？
Hey, keep your voice down. What?

262
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,696
怎么了？没什么
What's wrong? Nothing.

263
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,899
我刚才看到了一些很奇怪的东西
I just watched something really weird.

264
00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:37,768
那不是真的，所以…
It couldn't have been real, so...

265
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:41,138
好吧 那台电脑上有什么东西么？
okay. Is there anything on that computer?

266
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,773
我在复制他的硬盘
I'm cloning his hard drive now.

267
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:44,241
应该不会太久
It shouldn't take too long.

268
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:47,578
这里，看这个
Here, look at this.

269
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,747
磁带是我最后的链接
Tape is the final link for me.

270
00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:53,918
我知道  你已经发布了一大部分
I know a lot of you have posted that it only affects you

271
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,853
如果你按照正确的顺序播放 那它只会影响你… 
if you play it in a correct sequence.

272
00:25:55,855 --> 00:25:59,723
但是 我一直在实验
But I've been experimenting on...

273
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:02,560
是这个孩子么？
Is this the kid?

274
00:26:02,562 --> 00:26:04,562
是的，是他
Yeah, that's him.

275
00:26:04,564 --> 00:26:06,163
我在他的房间里找到一些笔记
I found some notebooks in his room.

276
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:08,098
像是日记 虽然大部分只是胡说
Kind of like journals. Mostly just nonsense, though.

277
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,069
我现在要扔了它们
I'm going through them right now.

278
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,971
你为什么不，例如，继续看这个带子？
Why don't you, like, keep looking at these tapes?

279
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:16,206
孩子是一个收藏家 我不知道谁知道呢？
Kid's a collector. I don't know. Who knows?

280
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:18,008
也许有些东西和他们相关
Maybe there's something relevant on them.

281
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:21,278
哦额… 好吧
Oh. Um... Okay.

282
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,180
我们都只用电磁能量
We're all just electromagnetic energy,

283
00:26:23,182 --> 00:26:25,616
然后这些模拟磁带
then these analog tapes capturing images

284
00:26:25,618 --> 00:26:26,984
捕捉超自然影像
of the supernatural,

285
00:26:26,986 --> 00:26:29,286
他们会影像我们的大脑皮层
they can affect our cerebral cortex.

286
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:33,223
他们… 他们… 
They... they...

287
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:12,896
嘿，室贝
Hey, babe.

288
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:14,732
别对我说“嘿，室贝”麦克沙利文
Don't "hey, babe" me, Mike Sullivan.

289
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:16,133
我门准备去吃早餐
We're supposed to be having breakfast.

290
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:18,102
是的，但这是一个美好的一天
Yeah, but it's a beautiful day.

291
00:27:18,104 --> 00:27:19,937
我只想骑自行车出去兜兜风
I just want to take the bike out for a spin.

292
00:27:19,939 --> 00:27:22,206
我想让你带我去兜风
I wanted you to take me for a spin.

293
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:25,142
你知道，你骑那辆车比我起得好多了
You know, you ride that bike more than you ride me.

294
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:28,979
是的，但是你知道，自行车只是一个物质的东西，宝贝
Yeah, but you know the bike is just a physical thing, babe.

295
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:31,181
嗯   嗯
Mm-hmm.

296
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:34,284
现在，跟我说你爱我！
Now, tell me you love me.

297
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:36,353
我爱你
I love you.

298
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:39,256
好的，好极了  注意安全，宝贝
Okay, good enough. Be safe, babe.

299
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:43,160
好的，再见
All right, bye.

300
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:13,157
请帮帮我！
Help me! Please!

301
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:14,892
- 你还好吗？  - 我的男朋友！
- Are you okay? - My boyfriend!

302
00:28:14,894 --> 00:28:16,427
你得帮帮我男朋友！
You have to help my boyfriend!

303
00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:19,029
啊  我正准备帮
 I'm getting help.

304
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:23,701
不！求求你  帮帮他
No, please! Help Dan!

305
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:26,036
噢！天哪！
Oh, God!

306
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:29,006
嘿，嘿，嘿，嘿，嘿，到我这里来
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, stay with me.

307
00:28:29,008 --> 00:28:32,409
狗屎！他妈的！
Shit! Fuck!

308
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:34,344
神啊
God.

309
00:28:38,751 --> 00:28:42,753
谁在那儿？
Who's there?

310
00:28:42,755 --> 00:28:48,125
警察就在我的后面   你最好赶紧跑
The police are right behind me, so you better run.

311
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:50,360
我有他妈的一根大棍子！
I got a big fucking stick!

312
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:56,066
什么鬼东西？
What the fuck?

313
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:01,438
嘿，嘿，赶快，我们得走了！
Hey, hey, come on, we got to go!

314
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,141
哇！啊！
Whoa! 

315
00:29:04,143 --> 00:29:06,844
啊！滚开！
Get off!

316
00:29:15,154 --> 00:29:19,757
死吧，你这个臭婊子！你这个臭婊子！
Die, you fucking bitch! You fucking bitch!

317
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,399
救命！！救命！
Help. Help!

318
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,289
亲爱的，你确定知道要去哪里吗？
Honey, you sure you know where you're going?

319
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:33,523
这看起来不像是一条路
This does not look like a trail.

320
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:36,593
当然 我知道要去哪里
Of course I know where I'm going.

321
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:38,428
相信我 你怎么能这么说？
Trust me. How can you tell?

322
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:42,633
- 好的，这儿以前是一条路    - 这儿没路
- Well, it used to be a trail. - There's no trail here.

323
00:31:42,635 --> 00:31:44,534
看起来你一点都不熟悉吧？
This doesn't look familiar to you at all?

324
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,403
不，不是的
No, not whatsoever.

325
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,472
我的意思是很漂亮，我会给你很多
I mean it's pretty, I'll give you that much.

326
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:50,540
哦，妈的
Holy shit.

327
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:53,343
噢，我的神
Oh, my God.

328
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:01,952
他是…
Is he...

329
00:32:01,954 --> 00:32:03,987
我想是
I think so.

330
00:32:03,989 --> 00:32:08,659
看上去他被什么东西咬了
It looks like he's been bit by something.

331
00:32:08,661 --> 00:32:12,095
你可以摸摸他的脉搏，确定一下
Will you check his pulse, just to be sure?

332
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:16,433
没了
Nothing.

333
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:18,302
我的神啊！我的意思是，我们能做什么呢？
My God, I mean, what could have done this?

334
00:32:18,304 --> 00:32:21,004
我不知道我不知道
I don't know. I don't know.

335
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:23,173
- 一只动物？ - 是的，你好
- An animal?  - Yes, hello.

336
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:25,676
我们发现一个人他好像… 浑身是血
We found someone. He's, like, covered in blood,

337
00:32:25,678 --> 00:32:28,545
没有脉搏了
and there's no pulse.

338
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:31,148
我们在自行车道上 然后…
We're on the bike trails and...

339
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,649
我的意思是，他看上去被什么东西咬了
I mean, it looks like he's been bit by something.

340
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:37,154
被咬了一口，是吗？这是我的猜测
It's a bite, right? That would be my guess.

341
00:32:37,156 --> 00:32:38,422
这是国家公园还是什么的？我不记得了
What state park is this? I don't remember.

342
00:32:38,424 --> 00:32:40,023
这是金石国家公园
This is gold stone state park.

343
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:42,559
是的，我们在金石国家公园
Yeah, we're at gold stone state park.

344
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:45,162
但是我不确定，我们确切在哪里
But I'm not sure, exactly, where we are here.

345
00:32:45,164 --> 00:32:47,331
这是…从高速下来的路
It's the... the trail off of highway one.

346
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:50,968
是的，在高速下来的小路上
Yeah, on the trails off of highway one.

347
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,203
好吧，他们派人来了吗？
Okay. They're sending somebody?

348
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:55,672
他们要派…联系我们和公园护林员
They're gonna send... connect us with a park ranger.

349
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:58,642
好吧，哦，妈的
Okay. Holy shit.

350
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:03,714
神啊
God.

351
00:33:03,716 --> 00:33:06,550
- 等等    - 亲爱的，你在干嘛？
- Wait a minute. - Honey, what are you doing?

352
00:33:06,552 --> 00:33:09,720
- 我认为我听到一些声音  - 什么声音？
- I think I heard a noise. - What kind of noise?

353
00:33:09,722 --> 00:33:12,489
我不知道 好像他在说什么
I don't know. It's like he said something.

354
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:15,025
嘿…嘿，嘿！
Hey...Hey. Hey!

355
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:18,695
放开我  放开我，伙计！
Get off me! Get off me, man!

356
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:23,600
放开他！停下！停下！
Get off of him! Stop it! Stop!

357
00:33:23,602 --> 00:33:25,268
放开他！啊！
Get off him! 

358
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,404
不！放开！
No! Get off!

359
00:33:27,406 --> 00:33:29,006
不！停下！放开！
No! Stop it! Get off!

360
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:32,009
啊！哦，我的神啊！
Oh, my God!

361
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:13,170
生日快乐！
Happy Birthday!

362
00:36:13,172 --> 00:36:15,238
生日快乐！比安卡
Happy Birthday, Bianca.

363
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:21,945
好吧，亲爱的
All right, honey.

364
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:35,926
走！走！
Go! Go!

365
00:36:57,883 --> 00:36:59,282
上车上车！我们走
Get in the car. Get in the car. Let's go.

366
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:02,319
快，快，快开 快点，开快点
Hurry, hurry, hurry. Faster, faster.

367
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:04,254
快点，快点，快点，快点，快点
Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry, hurry, hurry.

368
00:37:04,256 --> 00:37:07,257
进去 上车吧！上车吧！
Get in. Get in! Get in!

369
00:37:09,595 --> 00:37:13,363
快点，伙计 是的！
Come on, man. Yeah!

370
00:37:13,365 --> 00:37:16,933
啊！不！不！
No! No!

371
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:19,869
哦！妈的！
Oh, shit!

372
00:38:54,066 --> 00:38:56,666
喂？
Hello?

373
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,602
迈克？迈克，迈克，迈克
Mike? Mike, Mike, Mike.

374
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:04,107
你还好吗？
Are you okay?

375
00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:08,411
你的屁股    拨打我，傻瓜
You butt-dialed me, goofball.

376
00:39:08,413 --> 00:39:10,880
哦，好吧，我爱你，宝贝
Oh, well, I love you, baby.

377
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:14,017
不能等你回家，再见
Can't wait for you to get home. Bye.

378
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:18,915
这儿情况怎么样？
Hey, how's it going in here?

379
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:21,451
嘿
Hey.

380
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:33,096
抱歉，我肯定是睡着了
Sorry. I must've fallen asleep.

381
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:35,698
哦，我的天啊
Oh, my God.

382
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,669
你的鼻子流血了头抬起来
Your nose is bleeding. Don't tilt your head back.

383
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:42,071
它只是进了你的喉咙
It'll just go down your throat.

384
00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:44,607
您偏头痛吗？嗯…
This one of your migraines? Mm...

385
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:47,477
嗯，你钱包里的是你的药吗？
Mmhmm. Are your pills in your purse?

386
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:50,580
是的
Yeah.

387
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,153
他们不在这儿
They're not in here.

388
00:40:57,155 --> 00:40:59,189
你能让他们留在你的公寓吗？
Could you have left them at your apartment?

389
00:40:59,191 --> 00:41:02,992
也行 我不知道 我…
Maybe. I don't know. I...

390
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:04,828
好吧，你想让我做些什么呢？
all right, so what do you want me to do?

391
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:06,563
我们来的路上有家药店
We passed a drugstore on the way here.

392
00:41:06,565 --> 00:41:10,800
需要我回去帮你买点阿司匹林或者别的药吗
I could go back, get you some aspirin or something.

393
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:14,170
好吧，我不想动
Yeah. I don't feel like moving.

394
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:18,475
不过把你一个人丢在这儿我不太安心
All right, well, I feel kind of weird leaving you...

395
00:41:18,477 --> 00:41:21,144
你快去吧
just go.

396
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:25,248
好的，那我马上回来
Okay. I'll be right back.

397
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:58,515
马利克，我这儿有声音但是没有图像
Malik, I'm getting audio, but no visual.

398
00:41:58,517 --> 00:42:01,217
检查一下是不是连接问题稍等
Check the connection. Wait, wait, wait.

399
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:02,752
现在怎么样？
Okay, how 'bout now?

400
00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:06,256
嗯，好了
现在怎么样？
That's... okay, we're good.

401
00:42:06,258 --> 00:42:08,625
- 好了吗？   - 好了
- We're good? - We're good.

402
00:42:08,627 --> 00:42:12,962
给我看看
All right. Let me see.

403
00:42:12,964 --> 00:42:14,764
干得不错，现在切换到莉娜那边
All right, perfect. Now switch to Lena-cam.

404
00:42:14,766 --> 00:42:16,266
好的
All right.

405
00:42:16,268 --> 00:42:18,568
能看见我吗
Do you see me, gents?

406
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:20,937
很清楚，亚当
Crystal clear. Adam?

407
00:42:20,939 --> 00:42:22,906
你那儿怎么样？
Can you tell?

408
00:42:22,908 --> 00:42:24,941
不行这边什么都看不见
No. From here, not a thing.

409
00:42:24,943 --> 00:42:28,144
但是，如果我放大一些… 
But if I zoom in...

410
00:42:28,146 --> 00:42:32,749
你在看她最上面的扣子，是吗，亚当？
The top button, Adam. Well?

411
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:36,219
好吧，我们姑且相信你有正当理由 一定要找到那颗扣子
Let's just say you really have to be looking for it.

412
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:27,323
亚当
Yo, Adam.

413
00:45:27,325 --> 00:45:29,892
把间谍相机递给我    在哪儿？
Would you pass me the spy cam? Where?

414
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:31,394
在我包里，前面一点
In my bag. In the front.

415
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:34,931
- 好的  - 谢谢

416
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,507
接住了
Here, heads up.

417
00:45:44,509 --> 00:45:48,111
你知道吗，你就是个混蛋
You're a fucking dick, you know that?

418
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:58,521
好吗，伙计们？
Okay, guys?

419
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:33,489
嗨，莉蒂亚
Hi, Lydia. Oh...

420
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:50,006
嗯，好了
Yeah, all right.

421
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:58,514
噢，等会儿，等会儿
Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

422
00:46:58,516 --> 00:47:02,151
等会儿
Wait.

423
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:06,489
嗨，莉娜，你想要一个升级版的项链吗？
Hey, Lena, you want to upsize that thing?

424
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:12,061
不，这个东西太奇怪了，我根本不想戴它
No, this is creepy, man. I don't want to wear this.

425
00:47:12,063 --> 00:47:16,265
嗨，杰尼，这个归你了
Hey, Joni, this belongs to you, man.

426

427
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:21,003
来了来了
Coming, coming, coming.

428
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,945
杰尼，灯光不要太亮
Joni, not too bright.

429
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:10,987
亚当
Adam.

430
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:44,186
瞧，还有其他人在这拍摄呢，伙计们
Hey, we're not the only one filming, guys.

431
00:48:51,495 --> 00:48:53,562
是啊
是啊
Yeah.

432
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:11,280
好了
Okay.

433
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:14,483
哥们儿，能快一点不？
Dude, can you speed things up?

434
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:19,355
- 别忘了这个，快去  - 好
- Don't forget his. Go. - Cool.

435
00:49:19,357 --> 00:49:23,292
哥们儿，这个麦克风上有血迹
Dude, there's blood on the mic.

436
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,456
你还好吧？
You okay?

437
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:04,300
莉娜，你还好吗？
Lena, you okay?

438
00:50:04,302 --> 00:50:06,135
别管我，你们开始吧
Just start without me.

439
00:50:06,137 --> 00:50:08,270
- 你确定？  - 嗯
- You sure? - Yeah.

440
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:14,210
好的，那么
Yeah, um...

441
00:50:14,212 --> 00:50:16,779
不好意思 打断一下
Hey, you know what? Sorry.

442
00:50:16,781 --> 00:50:20,216
需要我过去看看莉娜吗
You want me to go check on Lena?

443
00:50:20,218 --> 00:50:23,285
看看她好点没
Just to make sure she's fine.

444
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:52,108
嗨，前娜，你好些了吗？
Hey, Lena. You okay?

445
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:54,743
莉娜，怎么了？
莉娜，怎么了？
Lena, what's wrong?

446
00:51:57,681 --> 00:52:01,517
莉娜，发生了什么事？
Yo. Hey, Lena. What happened?

447
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:05,347
嗯，马利克？
Um...Malik?

448
00:53:07,385 --> 00:53:08,784
- 真的吗？  - 是我不好
- Seriously? - My bad.

449
00:53:08,786 --> 00:53:09,885
我以为我昨天充过电了
I thought I charged it yesterday.

450
00:53:09,887 --> 00:53:12,755
没事儿，我来处理
Man... All right, I got this.

451
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:49,258
电池，电池
Batteries, batteries.

452
00:53:54,532 --> 00:53:57,766
亚当，这情况不止一天了
It's been over a day, Adam.

453
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:02,571
听着，要知道
Listen, I need to know whether

454
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:04,640
不管是我还是你告诉马利克这件事
it's going to be me or you telling Malik.

455
00:54:04,642 --> 00:54:07,710
我们都对不起他
We owe it to him.

456
00:54:07,712 --> 00:54:11,947
你确定孩子是我的？
Are you even sure it's mine?

457
00:54:11,949 --> 00:54:14,917
- 马利克和我没…  - 没什么？
- Malik and I haven't... - haven't what?

458
00:54:14,919 --> 00:54:18,988
已经有一段时间了
It's been a while.

459
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:21,624
该死的 他可是我的…
Fuck! He's my fucking...

460
00:54:21,626 --> 00:54:22,891
他妈的 他还是我最好的朋友呢
he's my fucking best friend.

461
00:54:22,893 --> 00:54:25,594
而且他是我的未婚夫
And he's my fiance.

462
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:27,896
亚当，我怀孕了… 
Adam, I am pregnant...

463
00:54:27,898 --> 00:54:29,598
你是孩子的爸爸
And you're the father.

464
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,301
该死的 遮住你的摄像机
Just cover your fucking camera.

465
00:54:34,905 --> 00:54:39,775
你以为我愿意这样吗？
Do you think I wanted this to happen?

466
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:42,978
快，快，听我说
快，快，听我说
Hey, hey, come on, come on. Listen.

467
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:48,417
我们可以去找一个人，做出弥补，没有人会受到伤害
We can go see someone, fix this, no one's hurt.

468
00:54:48,419 --> 00:54:51,954
- 搞什么？  - 怎么了？
- What the fuck? - What? What?

469
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:54,857
滚你妈的  我根本不需要你！
Fuck you! I don't need you.

470
00:54:54,859 --> 00:54:56,759
我要自己去跟马利克说
I'll tell Malik myself.

471
00:54:56,761 --> 00:55:00,296
我留不留住这个孩子，他会不会离开我
And whether or not I keep this, and whether or not he walks,

472
00:55:00,298 --> 00:55:01,964
都与你无关
I still don't fucking need you!

473
00:55:01,966 --> 00:55:04,033
你说什么？
What?

474
00:55:04,035 --> 00:55:06,502
你听见了
You heard me.

475
00:55:06,504 --> 00:55:09,605
那好，就这么决定了
Fine. Decision made.

476
00:55:09,607 --> 00:55:12,775
我们就是一群混蛋！！！
Fuck me, fuck you, fuck him.

477
00:55:12,777 --> 00:55:15,511
老天，真该死！
God damn it.

478
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:16,725
哦，上帝！
Oh, shit! Jesus!

479
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:31,139

487
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:41,463
阿门

488
01:01:45,803 --> 01:01:48,336
不，不，不！

489
01:01:48,338 --> 01:01:49,471
