1
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,820
''Amazing Grace.''

2
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,540
Excuse me?

3
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,220
My grandmother sang that song to me.

4
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,500
That's real nice.

5
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:43,620
l especially like the part that goes,
''l once was lost, but now l'm found.''

6
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:48,180
Take you, for instance. You must be
a fool to roll up in here, man.

7
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,900
But l figure you must be lost.

8
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:55,100
So l tell you what. See this here?
This is for your bill.

9
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,580
And...

10
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,540
...since you look like
such a jovial individual...

11
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,780
...here's the tip.

12
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,860
So ''find'' your ass out of here.

13
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,580
We haven't finished our drinks.

14
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:37,980
You finished now?

15
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,300
Let it go, Po.

16
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,260
This is a hassle we don't need.

17
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,660
And don't come back, zipperhead.

18
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,540
Po, get them out of here!

19
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,860
Now.

20
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,220
Let's go.

21
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,540
Guess you wanna gamble
with your life.

22
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,260
Casino's as good a place as any.

23
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,860
Guess l could use a little exercise.

24
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,980
Guns don't kill people.

25
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,700
People kill people.

26
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,100
For example,
these two guys with the machine guns.

27
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,180
lf they start blasting off...

28
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,740
...ain't none of y'all going home!

29
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:48,900
You guys are disturbing my business.
So if your ass ain't black...

30
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,100
...you'd better get up out of here
before it really get hot!

31
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,420
Let's go.

32
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,300
Ladies, excuse us, please.

33
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,460
-What are you doing, Kai?
-Get them out.

34
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,540
-You too.
-No. Stay.

35
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,100
You too, please.

36
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,380
What were you doing?
We're in a damn war.

37
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,220
l'm a big boy now.

38
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,500
These black guys'll bury you.

39
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,980
You work for me, Kai.

40
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,380
l work for your father.

41
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,700
Get your head out of your ass, Po.

42
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,300
As long as there's a war going on,
you're my responsibility.

43
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,660
l can take care of myself.

44
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,700
Oh, my God.

45
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,340
Tiger, you killing me, man.
l hate this game.

46
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,620
lsaak!

47
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,820
You have a phone call.

48
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,780
l'll take it in the house.

49
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,980
l need a break anyway.

50
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,660
l don't even know why
you stressing it, man.

51
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,860
You know why l'm stressing.
All future business deals...

52
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:11,500
...will take place not in the pool
hall, but in somebody's country club.

53
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,300
You know that.

54
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,700
lsaak, if you're serious
about going straight...

55
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,140
...l wanna know if you got a plan
for old Mac.

56
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,340
Or should l start looking at the
classifieds?

57
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,140
As long as l'm breathing...

58
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,540
...you ain't ever got to worry about
no classifieds.

59
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,180
Come on, boy.

60
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,180
You know it's me and you.

61
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,140
Hey, what you got for me?

62
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,260
You sure about that?

63
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,580
What's wrong?

64
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,900
What's wrong, man?

65
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,460
Somebody canceled Ch'u's boy.

66
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:00,300
You set up a meeting with Ch'u ASAP,
then find out who killed his boy.

67
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,500
Don't even sweat it, okay?
l got it.

68
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,100
Mr. O'Day.

69
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,100
Mr. Sing's at gate B-1 2.

70
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,580
Thank you.

71
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,940
Nice touch on the metal detectors.

72
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:25,180
lKeeps everybody honest, my man.

73
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,420
You have my deepest condolences.

74
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,180
Thank you.

75
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,660
What happened to your son
was tragic, Mr. Sing.

76
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,220
Very unnecessary.

77
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,100
l want you to know l'll be
looking into this personally.

78
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:51,100
You will forgive me
if l'm not easily moved.

79
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,860
Mr. Sing...

80
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,940
...with all due respect,
there is no way...

81
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,100
...anybody in my camp would touch
your family...

82
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,900
...any more than anybody in your camp
would touch mine.

83
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,140
lt just wouldn't happen.

84
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:13,180
Our business venture will continue.

85
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,940
l'm pleased to hear that.

86
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,860
Make sure we got 24-hour security
for my son and daughter.

87
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,260
lt's all been arranged, chief.

88
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,700
Make those lemon tarts for the kids,
okay?

89
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,500
l need to get a signature from you.

90
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,300
All right, thanks.

91
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,300
-You're welcome, dear.
-Excuse me.

92
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,140
-Do you have this in a small?
-One minute. Amy.

93
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,580
Help her out for me.
She'll help you.

94
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,900
-What are y'all doing?
-You got a little something-something?

95
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,780
Girl, tell him to turn up the music,
okay?

96
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,420
Break it on down!

97
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,260
Show them how we used to do it.

98
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,100
Watch the store for me, okay?

99
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,900
Oh, shit.

100
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,300
What a name for a store:
Serpentine Fire.

101
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,540
That's tight. lt's real tight.

102
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,780
lKool and the Gang jam from
back in the day, right?

103
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,780
Earth, Wind and Fire.

104
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,980
That serious shit.

105
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,580
Do l know you?

106
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,700
How you gonna play me like that?

107
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,180
You know l work for your pops.

108
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:02,580
-Right. Your name starts with an ''M.''
-Yeah, that's it.

109
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,820
Moron.

110
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,420
Funny. lt's Maurice, all right?

111
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,820
l'd love to reminisce with you,
but l'm busy right now...

112
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,620
...so let's do this later, okay?

113
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,420
lt don't work like that.

114
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,460
Excuse me?

115
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,100
Your father could be
catching some static...

116
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,300
...and Mac wants me
to watch your back.

117
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,660
Let me tell you something.

118
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:27,300
Whatever my father and Mac are into
has nothing to do with me.

119
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,460
You can hate them all you want.
That's your business.

120
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,340
lf they tell me not to let you out of
my sight, you can go to confession...

121
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,940
...and it's going to be you,
me and the priest.

122
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,100
That's ridiculous.

123
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,500
Look. My ride's right over there.

124
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,460
Back seat or the trunk.
Make it easy on yourself.

125
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,380
Your choice, baby girl.

126
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,380
Waiting for the magic word.

127
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,620
Please.

128
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,260
Stuck-up.

129
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,780
l got some coloring books
in the back.

130
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,620
-You think you're funny.
-l'm babysitting.

131
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,020
l gotta bring something
for the kids.

132
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,380
Can l get my leg in the car?

133
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:10,660
Damn!

134
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,340
The NFL announced Friday
that Oakland, ,,

135
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,500
,,, will become home
to its newest expansion team,

136
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,780
The question of who the new owners
will be is still unresolved,

137
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,180
For more we go to Jody Vance,

138
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,780
That's right, Perry,

139
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,580
Several groups ofinvestors will be
presenting proposals this week,

140
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:49,420
l thought we were done with football
when the Raiders left town.

141
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,020
-Yeah, well, jobs.
-What?

142
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,420
Jobs. See, if they have to build
another stadium...

143
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,460
...some of us that have been less
fortunate can attain jobs.

144
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:03,100
Harold, your unfortunate ass been
sitting in that chair for 1 5 years.

145
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,060
You couldn't attain a job if one
bit you in the butt.

146
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,020
You think you're funny, don't you?

147
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,100
Got a package for you.

148
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,340
l'm laughing because
you think you're funny.

149
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,940
Thanks.

150
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,740
You want a job, Harold?
Open this damn box.

151
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,500
Well, lookie, lookie.

152
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,780
Who sent you a present?

153
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,580
l don't know.
Probably your wife.

154
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,140
There you go again.

155
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,060
Thank you.

156
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,860
-Excuse me.
-Off duty.

157
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,180
Can you take me here?

158
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,500
Can't you understand English?

159
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,220
Two words: off duty.

160
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,180
How you doing?

161
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,660
How you doing?!

162
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,820
This shit tight, huh?

163
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,180
This shit's tight.
Girl, what's your name?

164
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,020
l said what's your name?!

165
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,300
What? You don't like a big man?
You not knowing.

166
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,060
-What's up, Alonso?
-Trish, what's up?

167
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,220
-Just chilling. Getting some albums.
-That's it today?

168
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,460
-You want this on your tab?
-Yeah, please.

169
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,780
Thank you.

170
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,940
This is my shit!

171
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,260
Shit!

172
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,860
This is my shit right here!
l got something for you right now.

173
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,900
My bad.

174
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,260
Shit!

175
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,340
Thank goodness. Just drive.

176
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,140
Two words: off duty.

177
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,060
You know what?

178
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,380
Jesus.

179
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,980
Two words for you, buddy:
on duty, 50 bucks.

180
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,860
l'm gonna find you!
l know where you work at!

181
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,980
Please, just do me a favor
and get me out of here.

182
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:10,940
Who's that?

183
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,540
Nobody.

184
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,020
Where did you learn to drive?

185
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,180
Ahkbar?

186
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,740
Hong lKong.

187
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,220
You gonna start the meter?

188
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,740
You steal a lot of cabs
in Hong lKong?

189
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,460
You want me to pull over?

190
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,940
No, no. Just...turn here.

191
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:04,740
So, Ahkbar, tell me. ls it true what
they say about Hong lKong?

192
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,700
What's that?

193
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,300
All you guys do kung fu.

194
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,660
Of course.

195
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,900
State law.

196
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,900
Can you break a board with your head?

197
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,300
Sure.

198
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,140
That l'd have to see.
You must be a very dangerous man.

199
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,740
Are you scared?

200
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,580
Don't take this personal...

201
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,140
...but l've been around more
dangerous guys than you.

202
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,940
Right here's fine.

203
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,820
No charge.

204
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,900
lKeep it. l won't call the cops.

205
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,660
l don't want your money.

206
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,260
You seem like a nice guy.

207
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,340
l am.

208
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:50,500
You should find a new profession.
Stealing cars doesn't fit you.

209
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,100
What's your name?

210
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,660
You think l want you calling me?

211
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,980
l don't have a phone.

212
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,220
Well, dead giveaway.

213
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,660
Besides, you drive like shit.

214
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,220
How are those acquisitions
coming along?

215
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,460
Progressing real nice, man.

216
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,860
l just have three more deeds
to get signed over.

217
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,260
Let me be clear.
You don't play around with the NFL.

218
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:43,100
lt's their America, and their deadline
is progressing in less than a week.

219
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,660
l know.

220
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,300
You gotta remember something,
Mr. Roth.

221
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,940
These people have owned them stores
for over 30 years.

222
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:56,740
So what if they need a couple more
days to mull over their decision?

223
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,540
These are tense times right now.
You know what l mean?

224
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,500
Shit.

225
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,500
You're murdering yourself.

226
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,460
Golf is a game of finesse,
not power.

227
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,540
ln that way,
it's much like the rest of life.

228
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,580
The key is letting the body
work together.

229
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,860
You want to get a good turn
so the wrist breaks naturally.

230
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,020
Make sure you keep your eyes
on the ball.

231
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,420
This shaft, l don't like it.
lt ain't working for me.

232
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,540
Save the excuses.

233
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:53,020
With all respect to the shop owners,
without the deeds, there's no deal.

234
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:57,300
Without the land deal, there's no
presentation. So there's no...

235
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,700
-What's the popular term these days?
-Cheddar.

236
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,140
That's right. No cheddar.

237
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,260
Do l make myself clear?

238
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,740
lf l say l'll deliver, l'll deliver.

239
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,180
Hey, hey, hey, now.
Sorry l'm late.

240
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,740
Girl, knowing the way you shop,
l'd say you're early.

241
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,940
Oh, really? Funny.
l got some hot stuff.

242
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,420
Good. Work it out!
Your brother's in the back.

243
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,940
You know the guy that got whacked?

244
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,900
You mean Ch'u's boy?

245
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:33,380
He called me. Ain't that some shit?
Same night he got killed, Pop.

246
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,260
Jesus Christ.

247
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,900
What'd he want, Colin?

248
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:41,220
l don't know. Oh, look, man.

249
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,980
Let me holler back at you later.

250
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,300
You be in my office in one hour.

251
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,460
l asked you not to do business here.

252
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,500
-Hi, sis. Nice to see you too.
-l mean it, Colin. Come on.

253
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,820
This is my place, okay?
l got kids hanging here all the time.

254
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:04,780
-lf this is what you're about--
-Don't start with that speech.

255
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,660
For once, let's not go there.

256
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,980
l was on the phone talking to Pop.

257
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:18,980
Look, come on. He's a businessman.
l work for this businessman.

258
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,660
Stop tripping over this shit.

259
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,340
Colin, wait.

260
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,180
Look. l'm sorry.

261
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,540
l just worry about you, okay?

262
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,820
That's all.

263
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,460
Yeah, l know.

264
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,860
And l love you too, Trish.

265
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,860
But you ain't got to worry about me.

266
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,540
l'm fine.

267
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,660
Good afternoon. Serpentine Fire.

268
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,700
Right there, baby.

269
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,100
What's good?

270
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,300
Try the parking lot.

271
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:15,500
l'm just trying to do my job, Trish.
Just like Mo.

272
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,580
He told me the shit you pulled.

273
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,620
Plain stupid is what it was.

274
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:23,700
Things are gonna get tense now that
that Chinese dude got popped.

275
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,660
-Was that one of your jobs too?
-No...

276
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,100
...that shoddy work's not my style.

277
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,060
l'm sorry. Poor baby!
Have l got you all wrong?

278
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,860
You don't have a clue
to what l'm about.

279
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,540
Why don't you tell me?

280
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,180
For starters,
you gotta get past the facade.

281
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,580
You got some serious
facade going on.

282
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,180
Well, so do you.
So does everybody.

283
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:47,700
And this Miss l-don't-need-nobody
isn't you. Not the real you.

284
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:51,980
-You saving yourself for lKobe Bryant?
-ls that what you think l'm doing?

285
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:56,820
l think you need to consider the
possibility that you've met him.

286
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:02,740
You're an errand boy for my father.
You're nothing.

287
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,500
Fair enough.

288
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,660
But there comes a time when a man
has to strike out on his own.

289
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,860
Stake his own claim.

290
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,660
How could l have missed it?

291
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:16,220
l think l'm hopelessly in love
with you.

292
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:20,220
Make fun all you like.
Soon l'll be way too much for you.

293
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:24,620
Those big brown eyes will get all
misty wishing there were two of me.

294
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,060
Fill yourself all you want.
l just lost my appetite.

295
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,660
Sit down.

296
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:35,020
You don't have to respect me,
but you will let us protect you.

297
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,620
Do you understand?

298
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,700
Do you understand?!

299
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:54,460
Mac, you're so smooth
with the ladies, baby.

300
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,900
lf l want Eddie Murphy,
l'll go to the goddamn movies.

301
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,060
Yeah, dog.

302
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:04,060
Good. Give him some fat-free water
or something.

303
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,180
Where my drink, man?!

304
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,660
The fuck you looking at?

305
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,380
All the way down the end there!

306
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,900
Finish telling me
about this call you got.

307
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,460
Guy calls,
says he wants to meet me.

308
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,500
For what?

309
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,300
l don't know.
We didn't talk that long.

310
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:39,140
Said he had a little something
might put a stop to this war.

311
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,260
A little something?

312
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,420
l didn't trust him,
so l said meet me at Silk's.

313
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,620
As soon as you got that call,
you should've told me.

314
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:02,620
Maybe next time l cross the street,
you should hold my hand.

315
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:07,140
Hey, who the hell you talking to?
l will knock the black off you, boy.

316
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,620
l mean no disrespect.

317
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:13,780
l'm just trying to be a man here.
l'm looking out for you.

318
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,620
l don't need you to look out for me,
Colin.

319
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,940
Have a seat.

320
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,140
Go on. Sit down.

321
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,580
Come on.

322
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,900
l've been working on a big deal.
A real big deal.

323
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:54,460
When it goes through, we're out
of this gangster nonsense for good.

324
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:57,980
Everything we do will be
strictly legit from here on out.

325
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,540
What do you mean?

326
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,380
l got something else lined up
for my boy.

327
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:06,500
You will get to run with this ball.
l guarantee that.

328
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,980
But you gotta use your head.

329
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,460
And you gotta listen.

330
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,660
You understand what l'm saying?

331
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,380
Yeah, Pop.

332
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,780
Finish your drink.

333
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,180
Collard Green.

334
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,940
Black Mac.

335
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,020
Something wrong?

336
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,340
You tell me.

337
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,500
Hey, chief.

338
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,260
Hate to be the bearer of bad news,
but you need to see this.

339
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:08,900
Calvin's place?

340
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,020
He was the sweetest guy in the world.

341
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:17,500
l'd better wrap up these acquisitions
quickly for you.

342
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,820
Things are getting pretty crazy
around here.

343
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,780
You gonna be okay?

344
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,780
Just give me a minute.

345
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,620
Okay, boss.

346
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:56,020
That's it right over there.

347
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,620
Okay. Lock up the store.

348
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:05,420
-We're going out tonight, right?
-Definitely.

349
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,820
Follow her.

350
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:50,020
Ahkbar. What the hell
are you doing here?

351
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,460
l need to ask you something.

352
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:54,820
You get out of my apartment
before l call the cops.

353
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:55,860
Please.

354
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:59,860
You're the only guy l know working
down the criminal ladder. What's up?

355
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:04,060
This is the last number my brother
called before he was murdered.

356
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,180
lt's the number of your shop.

357
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,500
lt is.

358
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,100
But l don't know your brother.

359
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:16,620
-Why would he want to talk to me?
-He called your store.

360
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,180
Yeah, but not to talk to me.

361
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:21,140
l got a girl who works the register.
lt could've been her.

362
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,340
My brother--

363
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,580
Brother?

364
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,180
Colin.

365
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:31,700
Sometimes he makes calls from the shop.
Mostly when l'm not around.

366
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,940
Could you talk to him?

367
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,260
That's Maurice and his gang.
Look, Ahkbar.

368
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:48,300
-l think it's--
-My name is Han.

369
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,060
Well, Han, look.

370
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:55,780
They find you, you'll have serious
problems. Go out the window.

371
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,380
No. l like this way.

372
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,180
lt's your funeral.

373
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:04,820
Dim sum good. You call again.
Dim sum all time. Thanks.

374
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,860
What you doing bothering
Miss O'Day?

375
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,540
He's the delivery boy, moron.

376
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:16,500
l done told you,
my name is Maurice, all right?

377
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,220
l'm sorry.
l keep forgetting, boo.

378
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:20,940
Hey, dog.

379
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,820
-You smell something?
-No, l don't smell nothing.

380
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:27,340
-Where's the take-out?
-You hungry, baby?

381
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,420
Cover the front.

382
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,220
Hey, Dim Sum!

383
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,940
You's a real funny man!

384
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,980
Mr. O'Day don't let things
slide lightly.

385
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:43,580
He also don't like the wrong element
around his daughter.

386
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,980
lt's up to me not to let it happen.

387
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,500
lKick his ass.

388
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,340
You ain't the only one
that knows some shit.

389
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:17,820
Get up! Get him!

390
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,620
He's headed around the front!

391
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,620
Who that motherfucker?

392
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,660
Great country.

393
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:24,380
Free cars.

394
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:45,980
Sun Tzu was lost to us by
assassination less than a month ago.

395
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:50,300
A grocery store was firebombed,
and his wife killed.

396
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:57,100
With all respect, Ch'u, any of us could
be killed at any time...

397
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,460
...overlord or not.

398
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,540
We are not the blacks, Victor.

399
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:06,820
Our loyalty to each other
is unquestioned.

400
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:11,260
At least let us strike harder.
Show our true strength.

401
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:17,180
We will only do that
when it serves us best.

402
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,260
Let Kai worry about this.

403
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:51,060
Han, l don't want to lose another son.

404
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,580
The old man didn't think you'd make it.

405
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:07,780
And you?

406
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:09,700
l knew you would.

407
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:14,100
lt's been a long time, Han.
lt's good to see you.

408
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,580
Tell me...

409
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:17,780
...what happened that night?

410
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,740
He got in a fight in a black club.

411
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:25,020
Threats had been made. They got Po the
same evening, before l could find him.

412
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,220
Why there?

413
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:29,660
He wouldn't tell me.

414
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:33,180
Your brother was a loose cannon,
but he didn't deserve this.

415
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,900
Why fight with blacks?

416
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,380
Well, the waterfront's only
four square miles.

417
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:46,100
Half the businesses belong to us...

418
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:48,140
...the other half to them.

419
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,020
lt was just a matter of time.

420
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:21,900
l was afraid prison would
make you soft.

421
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:26,300
People don't get soft in prison.

422
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:41,900
Pretty good.

423
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:50,100
-Here you go.
-Thank you so much.

424
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:52,540
You must be hungry.

425
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:55,740
Could you find something
better to do than creep up on me?

426
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:58,820
And besides,
aren't you in the wrong part of town?

427
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:00,860
At your store,
they said you were here.

428
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:02,820
Hold on a minute.
Come on, kids.

429
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:06,540
All right, all right.
Who wants what?

430
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:11,260
l wanted the yellow one.

431
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:12,820
Give it to him.
He's the baby.

432
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:16,260
Stop! You want one?

433
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:18,460
Sure. l want the yellow one.

434
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:20,740
Well, you get a green one.

435
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:31,420
Did you talk to your brother?

436
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:33,700
What made you think that?

437
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:35,260
Hey, time-out.

438
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,580
See that guy?
He works for my dad...

439
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:42,220
...and he's got a bad attitude.

440
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:49,300
Who's your friend?

441
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:51,380
We met in line.
l didn't catch your name.

442
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:54,540
-What's your name?
-My friends call me Ahkbar.

443
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:55,980
Well, Ahkbar...

444
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:57,660
...this is Mac. Mac, Ahkbar.

445
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:03,100
As-Salaam-Alaikum, Ahkbar.

446
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,340
Yo, ain't that the guy?

447
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:06,500
Hell, yeah.

448
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:10,620
Same chump took Mo's ride
after he beat us down.

449
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:13,700
Ain't nobody ever kicked my ass.
What are you talking about?

450
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:15,140
That the dude.

451
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:19,060
We can't get started, because we're
a man short. Would you help us out?

452
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:19,940
Me?

453
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,380
No. l don't know this game.

454
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:24,740
Man, it's easier than breathing.

455
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:27,700
Besides, Trish loves football players.

456
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:32,540
Right on.

457
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:41,580
Fellas, got myself a fresh recruit.

458
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,220
He's a rookie...

459
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:46,740
...so take it easy on him.

460
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:54,980
Give me that!

461
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:58,220
The brothers and l
always give rookies warm welcomes.

462
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:00,380
So don't worry about a thing.

463
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:02,580
l just need you to stand behind me.

464
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:06,820
l'll give you the ball, and you run
to the far end of the field.

465
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,500
That's all?

466
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,220
That's all.

467
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,500
Set!

468
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:16,300
Let's see your special on this one.

469
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:19,700
Mo's special!

470
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:23,460
We're coming, boys.

471
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:29,580
-Run!
-Run?

472
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,460
Come on!

473
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,140
Damn.

474
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:51,300
Like l told your ass the other day.

475
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,540
You ain't the only one
that knows some shit.

476
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:01,980
Good job, my man.

477
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:04,660
-Are they allowed to do that?
-Sure.

478
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:06,380
lt's a contact sport.

479
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,380
This time, run a little bit
and turn up the middle.

480
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,660
And l'll throw the ball to you.

481
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:14,060
lt's called the ''buttonhook.''

482
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:15,700
-On two.
-Buttonhook.

483
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:16,900
Right there.

484
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:18,620
Set!

485
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:40,420
Damn! Shakalack-shakalack.
Mo, you my Negro, Mo.

486
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:42,540
Break his ass.

487
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:50,380
How come nobody else gets hit?

488
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,580
Because you're the one with the ball.

489
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:56,260
Okay. l'd like hut three.

490
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,220
You all right?

491
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:05,260
Hey, brother!

492
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:07,020
American football!

493
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,220
-That was great!
-Brother!

494
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:18,300
-You were great.
-Damn, that was hot.

495
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:19,780
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

496
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:22,580
Here's my address.

497
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:26,260
Please let me know
when you talk to your brother.

498
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:27,580
Here.

499
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,260
-Did you see that?
-Awesome!

500
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:32,660
-l know.
-That was great!

501
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,780
Pop ain't feeling me.

502
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:44,900
He still wants me to ride around
with training wheels and shit.

503
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:48,700
l was like,
Pops got to understand that...

504
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:52,060
...me and him is cut from,
like, the same cloth.

505
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:55,980
He needs to start respecting me
as a man.

506
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:59,660
l mean, he needs to start respecting
my manhood.

507
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:01,620
Shit, l went to college.

508
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:04,660
That's right, baby. You did.

509
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:06,780
That's right, baby. l did.

510
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:09,740
Like that phone call l got
the other day.

511
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:14,300
Pop's too afraid about me handling
the business and stuff.

512
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:18,180
But, baby, l got ideas.
l mean, you know l got ideas.

513
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:22,620
Shit, l am an idea.

514
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:27,860
l'm about to have
an Einstein moment.

515
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:30,460
Magic about to happen.
lt's gonna be scary.

516
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:33,460
Hey, look, all l want to know is...

517
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:37,500
...when does Colin O'Day
get to run with the show?

518
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:40,620
Don't worry, baby.
Your turn's coming.

519
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:33,380
Sorry, Mr. O'Day.
These things are never easy.

520
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:38,100
Wait. Wait.

521
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:40,220
Don't look at this. Come on.

522
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:42,060
Look at me. Please!

523
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:44,780
No!

524
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:04,900
You had something to do with this.

525
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:06,940
What do you want me to say?

526
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:09,620
-Go to hell.
-What do you want?

527
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:14,340
You're as responsible as the people
who did this to my brother.

528
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:16,420
Don't come near me.
l hate you.

529
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:19,820
You might as well have thrown him
out that window yourself.

530
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,580
That was my boy, Mac.

531
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:41,740
l know.

532
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:51,260
They killed my boy.

533
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:57,260
We're at the crossroads now, lsaak.

534
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,780
l won't pretend l know
what you're feeling.

535
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:08,380
But l know you got to keep it
stitched up until business is done.

536
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,500
The people who did this...

537
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:15,180
...l promise you on my life...

538
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:18,460
...they'll be knocked out of the box
in due time.

539
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:20,140
l'll make sure of it.

540
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:44,660
What happened?

541
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:53,260
Once, Colin and l did something
we thought would really be funny.

542
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:57,100
He hid out front...

543
01:03:57,260 --> 01:03:59,420
...while l ran to tell my mom
he'd been hurt.

544
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:02,620
Hit by a car or something
really bad like that.

545
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:07,820
When she came,
he was supposed to jump out.

546
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:09,860
You know, surprise her...

547
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:13,460
...and we'd all fall out
and have this great laugh.

548
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:16,300
Me and my mom always loved
a good laugh.

549
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:22,300
l was about 8 or 9.

550
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:25,140
Colin was, like, 1 1 .

551
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:30,500
l don't remember
how we came up with it...

552
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:34,860
...but, sure enough, l start screaming
and yelling...

553
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:40,580
...and my mom runs out of the house.
She's, like, ''Trish, what's wrong?''

554
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:42,660
When l told her, l mean...

555
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:45,180
...the look on her face.

556
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:50,060
Even when Colin popped up to show it
was a joke, she couldn't stop crying.

557
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:52,020
She just held him close.

558
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:54,860
Clutched him, you know?

559
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:03,100
l was just a baby. l didn't get it
then, but l get it now.

560
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:05,020
Tell me.

561
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:08,620
-What happened?
-Colin's dead.

562
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:12,740
And no matter how hard l cry...

563
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:17,420
...he's not gonna pop up
and show me it was just a joke.

564
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:21,940
l'm sorry.

565
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:25,100
l need your help.

566
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:31,460
l gotta put this thing together
just as much as you do now.

567
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:37,900
Gentlemen, we are ready to approach
the NFL.

568
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:42,220
l don't think any of the other bids
are even in contention.

569
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:45,820
Our package is staggering.
We've got the money.

570
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:50,860
We've got the organization, waterfront
real estate seconds from the bridge.

571
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:54,460
God Himself couldn't have designed
a better spot for a stadium.

572
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:57,140
That's right. You know me well.

573
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:01,300
lf l say there's caviar on the
mountain, you bring the crackers.

574
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:03,700
l don't get it.

575
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:05,860
These are waterfront properties.

576
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:08,420
They must mean something.

577
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:10,580
Po didn't want them found.

578
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:15,140
Yeah, but why?

579
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:20,860
ls this the place?

580
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:23,700
Yeah. lt says 44 Driggs Road.

581
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:30,420
ls anybody here?

582
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:00,020
Get down!

583
01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:25,740
You're Chinese.

584
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:29,340
No shit!

585
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:37,100
l can't hit a girl.

586
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:47,940
ln America, if a girl's kicking your
ass, you don't have to be a gentleman.

587
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:00,180
Damn. Look at that!

588
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:02,780
They a trip.

589
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:07,340
Them little things pay the rent,
you know what l mean?

590
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:08,780
Yeah, no doubt.

591
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:13,740
Crabs in a barrel can't climb out,
and they don't want to stay in.

592
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:15,980
l guess they strange like that.

593
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:18,820
Some brothers strange like that too.

594
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:21,340
As soon as one of us move up...

595
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:24,940
...a crab motherfucker like yourself
pulls us right back down.

596
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:27,380
Let me tell you something.

597
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:30,700
This place seems like a piece of shit
to a guy like you...

598
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:34,820
...but that's still my piece of shit.
And l ain't selling it.

599
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:38,700
l got work to do.

600
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:41,020
Let's look at it another way.

601
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:49,780
You got two choices.
You either sign us over the deed...

602
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:52,940
...or l blow your head off
and leave it with these crabs.

603
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:55,020
Now, which is it?

604
01:13:57,220 --> 01:13:59,020
-Yo, yo! Okay!
-l can't hear you!

605
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:00,420
All right! l'll do it!

606
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:03,220
-What?
-l said l'll do it, man!

607
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:09,700
Go in and get me that deed.

608
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:16,420
Don't look at me.
l'll put your ass on the news tonight.

609
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:19,740
What's the matter with you, man?
You crazy?

610
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:23,980
l can live with that.

611
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:05,060
How are you? Good to see you.

612
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:06,300
Good to see you.

613
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:08,380
They don't care
there's a war going on.

614
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:10,940
They don't care if the damn barge
is on fire.

615
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:13,380
This is a treat.

616
01:15:14,180 --> 01:15:15,420
What brings you downtown?

617
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:16,900
You heard about Victor Ho?

618
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:21,340
We're looking forward to
some blowback.

619
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:24,940
That's why we're here. We got a tip
this place is gonna get hit.

620
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:26,900
You gotta be kidding me.

621
01:15:27,740 --> 01:15:29,100
-When?
-Right now.

622
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:35,060
Get the money.

623
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:51,100
Thank you for attending this meeting...

624
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:53,740
...on such a short notice.

625
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:56,460
My dear brothers, when you expire...

626
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:59,980
...your territory will remain
within the collective.

627
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:02,700
Of course, since l alone survive...

628
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:07,220
...the collective is,
in actuality, only me.

629
01:17:20,380 --> 01:17:23,900
You don't wanna be in my path
when my feet are put to the coals.

630
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:25,740
Misery loves company.

631
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:28,780
Oh, young Mr. Roth,
you sound nervous.

632
01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:32,380
May l suggest acupuncture?

633
01:17:33,580 --> 01:17:35,460
l hope you have some good news for me.

634
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:39,180
There's no need for threats
or theatrics.

635
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:43,420
None of us want to drag this out any
longer than it already has.

636
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:47,260
Then close out your business
and get me those deeds.

637
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:49,580
Damn. Susie!

638
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:53,220
Could you get me lKeyshawn Johnson,
please?

639
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:59,340
lt's Papa, baby. lt's me.
Don't be scared.

640
01:18:00,740 --> 01:18:03,220
Listen, l need you to come with me.

641
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:05,340
Why?

642
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:10,020
l'll tell you.
Just come on out front, okay?

643
01:18:28,180 --> 01:18:30,580
l can't have you hanging with
Ch'u's boy.

644
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:33,700
-His name is Han, Daddy.
-Okay, then.

645
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:35,380
l need you to stay away from Han.

646
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:37,540
Afraid l'll catch one of your
bullets?

647
01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:39,540
lt is too dangerous right now.

648
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:40,780
l'll take my chances.

649
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:50,260
Did you do it?

650
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:51,940
Did l do what?

651
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:53,780
Did you have his brother murdered?

652
01:18:53,980 --> 01:18:55,340
Where did that come from?

653
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:56,820
l need to know.

654
01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:59,340
No, l didn't.
l'm telling you, no.

655
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:01,780
l did not.

656
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:03,420
Trisha, look at me.

657
01:19:04,180 --> 01:19:06,940
l had nothing to do with it.

658
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:13,740
But one of them's going to pay
for what happened to Colin.

659
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:15,380
ls that what a businessman is?

660
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:18,060
That's what l call
protecting my family.

661
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:24,020
You can't touch me!

662
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:25,940
lnterception, baby!

663
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:28,100
-Come on, man.
-Running it back!

664
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:30,100
Look at that!
Go back to slow mo!

665
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:31,380
l'm coming for you.

666
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:33,220
l ain't gonna even look.

667
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:35,740
l'm just gonna play.
l can't see!

668
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:50,940
He could go...

669
01:19:51,060 --> 01:19:53,220
...all the way!

670
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:56,820
How your mama doing?

671
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:58,020
How your mama doing?!

672
01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:01,060
Touchdown, baby!

673
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:03,420
Take it, take it!

674
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:07,420
These nuts in your mouth.

675
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:09,860
l said put the nuts in your mou--

676
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:12,940
Why y'all not working?! Get to work!

677
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:15,580
Shiftless Negroes.

678
01:20:16,540 --> 01:20:17,820
Toby! Go on!

679
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:21,380
Where is Mac, Maurice?

680
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:23,020
He's out back.

681
01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:24,380
l wanna talk to him.

682
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:25,660
Yes, sir.

683
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:39,900
You sure you don't want nothing?

684
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:42,100
No, l'm okay.

685
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:43,740
l'll be downstairs.

686
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:45,100
All right.

687
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:19,700
l remember sitting in that chair...

688
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:23,020
...watching you fix your hair
for your first date.

689
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:25,980
You hooked me up with Dexter Benson.

690
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:29,540
My man Dex.

691
01:21:30,980 --> 01:21:33,340
-l really liked that boy.
-Please, Daddy.

692
01:21:33,620 --> 01:21:36,660
He was so scared, he bit my lip
when he kissed me good night.

693
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:38,020
Wait a second.

694
01:21:38,740 --> 01:21:41,300
You didn't kiss that boy
on your first date.

695
01:21:41,580 --> 01:21:43,220
That's right, l did.

696
01:21:43,780 --> 01:21:45,780
l guess l was trying
to get back at you.

697
01:21:48,140 --> 01:21:49,940
You know, l hate to admit it....

698
01:21:50,620 --> 01:21:52,340
l miss those times.

699
01:22:00,260 --> 01:22:02,780
l can tell you
when l missed your ma the most.

700
01:22:03,620 --> 01:22:06,660
At your graduations and your dates.

701
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:10,340
l know l ain't never been able
to talk to you.

702
01:22:11,420 --> 01:22:13,660
There's a lot of things
l wanted to say.

703
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:16,980
lt don't ever come out right.
l know that.

704
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:28,300
l want you in my life.

705
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:30,620
There are...

706
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:32,380
...certain things....

707
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:34,380
Until l can prove these things...

708
01:22:34,660 --> 01:22:36,300
...l want you to stay here with me.

709
01:22:36,980 --> 01:22:38,100
Listen to me.

710
01:22:38,380 --> 01:22:41,700
There are people out there who'll
try to hurt me by hurting you.

711
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:43,420
Like they did your brother.

712
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:46,580
l'll be damned
if l let them do that.

713
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:48,780
Who is it?

714
01:22:49,060 --> 01:22:50,140
You got a phone call.

715
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:51,500
Not now, Mac.

716
01:22:51,740 --> 01:22:53,060
lt's Roth.

717
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:56,340
Today's a good day.

718
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:58,300
lt's deed day.

719
01:22:58,780 --> 01:23:01,420
-l trust everything's in order.
-Absolutely,

720
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:03,660
Tonight all my dreams come true,

721
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:05,860
l'll see you at the club as planned.

722
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:08,180
l'll have your check.

723
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:12,060
Where do we stand with Silk?

724
01:23:12,780 --> 01:23:14,700
We're hooking up at 8:00.

725
01:23:15,180 --> 01:23:16,300
Watch out for him.

726
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:18,820
The boy's tricky.

727
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:21,180
Don't let him get the upper hand.

728
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:24,380
l can handle Silk.

729
01:23:35,380 --> 01:23:36,700
Are you out of your mind?

730
01:23:39,860 --> 01:23:42,060
What are you doing here?

731
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:44,180
l missed you.

732
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:48,780
You miss me. l'll miss you when
my father finds out you're here.

733
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:51,580
He's standing right outside the door.

734
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:53,340
What'll l do with you?

735
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:55,140
Jesus!

736
01:23:57,340 --> 01:23:58,900
Hey, Dad.

737
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:01,060
l gotta go take care of business.

738
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:03,980
You need anything,
you just say the word.

739
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:05,420
l am fine, Dad.

740
01:24:06,020 --> 01:24:08,780
l'm chilling.
You do what you gotta do, okay?

741
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:15,380
Jesus! Come on, you gotta go!

742
01:24:15,860 --> 01:24:17,100
No, what do you...?

743
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:25,260
-You all right?
-l'm fine, Daddy.

744
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:27,900
Listen, baby, you hungry?

745
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:30,900
They getting pizza.
Say the word, they'll bring it up.

746
01:24:31,140 --> 01:24:34,380
l'm not hungry.
lf l get hungry, l'll let them know.

747
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:37,140
l'll be back after a while.

748
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:46,140
Damn, this pizza good.

749
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:51,340
Baby girl, open up! l got some
sausage and pepperoni pizza!

750
01:24:51,540 --> 01:24:54,140
Open up the door.
Ain't no swine on it.

751
01:24:57,180 --> 01:25:00,700
Pizza make you wanna slap your mama.
What's this, Domino's?!

752
01:25:08,780 --> 01:25:10,700
Damn, never been up in here before.

753
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:15,700
They got Prince up on the wall.

754
01:25:15,940 --> 01:25:18,860
You a freak too, ain't you, Trish?
Where you at?

755
01:25:19,420 --> 01:25:20,940
l'm coming around the corner.

756
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:27,820
Damn!

757
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:31,580
So where are we going?

758
01:25:32,780 --> 01:25:34,100
Look.

759
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:38,180
All the places on this list
have been moved out or burned out.

760
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:39,660
Except this one.

761
01:25:41,860 --> 01:25:42,900
l know this one.

762
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:46,860
My father and Mac talked about that.
lt's Silk's casino.

763
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:48,460
Casino?

764
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:49,620
Let's gamble.

765
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:51,340
All right.

766
01:26:21,660 --> 01:26:24,300
Now you're giving me some
B-boy flavor.

767
01:26:24,940 --> 01:26:26,100
Hip-hop.

768
01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:34,380
l know hip-hop.

769
01:26:46,780 --> 01:26:48,260
Hey, what's up?

770
01:26:51,660 --> 01:26:54,980
Come on, he's with me. Okay?
Can you give me a break?

771
01:26:55,820 --> 01:26:56,940
You lsaak's girl, huh?

772
01:26:57,260 --> 01:26:58,340
That's right, cutie.

773
01:26:59,420 --> 01:27:00,620
Will you let me in?

774
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:03,900
All right.

775
01:27:04,180 --> 01:27:06,580
Thank you. Come on.

776
01:27:19,780 --> 01:27:22,340
l'm not feeling this.
Let's go to the dance floor.

777
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:26,620
-lt's not my scene.
-Not your scene? Cute. Let's go.

778
01:28:24,940 --> 01:28:25,900
Look here!

779
01:28:26,740 --> 01:28:28,700
Man, can you believe this?

780
01:28:35,260 --> 01:28:36,820
What the hell is she doing?

781
01:28:51,180 --> 01:28:52,140
What's up, Trish?

782
01:28:52,820 --> 01:28:54,100
What's up, Silk?

783
01:28:54,340 --> 01:28:55,460
Let's talk.

784
01:28:55,740 --> 01:28:56,820
All right.

785
01:28:57,620 --> 01:28:58,660
Come on.

786
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:04,620
Your pop's running around
like Donald Trump...

787
01:29:04,820 --> 01:29:08,300
...grabbing up every piece of
waterfront he can get his hands on.

788
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:10,620
Now he wants to be a club owner.

789
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:12,700
He's working on something big.

790
01:29:12,940 --> 01:29:15,500
Something big?
l don't care how big it is.

791
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:18,900
Your pops can sweat me,
and Mac can sweat me all they want.

792
01:29:19,100 --> 01:29:21,020
But Silk is staying right here.

793
01:29:21,340 --> 01:29:23,460
My sentiments exactly, Silkie.

794
01:29:23,860 --> 01:29:27,620
l think we all should stay right here
for one more negotiation.

795
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:31,900
lt's like that, partner? You're gonna
try to roll up in here on me?

796
01:29:32,180 --> 01:29:34,300
-What the hell are you doing?
-Shut up.

797
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:36,500
Does my daddy know about this?

798
01:29:36,740 --> 01:29:37,660
Sit down.

799
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:39,900
What?

800
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:41,180
What?

801
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:43,220
What?!

802
01:29:43,780 --> 01:29:45,180
You might as well lose the gat.

803
01:29:45,420 --> 01:29:48,180
lt's like l told your punk ass before...

804
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:50,420
...l ain't signing shit.

805
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:52,260
All right, l'll sign it myself.

806
01:30:02,980 --> 01:30:05,020
Well, well, well.

807
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:07,980
lf it ain't my man Dim Sum.

808
01:30:09,660 --> 01:30:10,820
Busy night?

809
01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:15,700
Ran off with the boss's daughter,
threw a wrench in Mac's program.

810
01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:17,620
And now...

811
01:30:17,820 --> 01:30:20,260
...you about to get your ass kicked.

812
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:22,460
Where is she?

813
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:25,220
You didn't think you'd get
them panties, did you?

814
01:30:25,940 --> 01:30:26,900
What?

815
01:30:27,140 --> 01:30:31,940
Trish. You didn't really think
she was gonna give it up to you.

816
01:30:32,380 --> 01:30:33,860
Here's the deal, meatball.

817
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:39,420
You let me go, l let you live.

818
01:30:42,340 --> 01:30:44,620
He say he gonna let me live!

819
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:50,980
l'm really gonna miss you.

820
01:30:51,180 --> 01:30:54,020
The way you make me laugh.
But look on the bright side.

821
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:56,420
Some you win...

822
01:30:57,220 --> 01:30:59,380
...and, Dim Sum, you lose.

823
01:31:14,180 --> 01:31:17,780
The hell what Mac say!
Somebody kill that son of a bitch!

824
01:31:32,780 --> 01:31:33,780
Get up!

825
01:31:33,980 --> 01:31:36,100
Get your bitch-asses up!
Come on!

826
01:31:40,740 --> 01:31:42,700
Dim Sum...!

827
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:52,300
Come out and play!

828
01:32:02,460 --> 01:32:03,660
Hey, rice noodle!

829
01:33:57,020 --> 01:33:58,380
What the hell you doing?!

830
01:33:58,860 --> 01:34:00,940
l hope you land on your feet,
grasshopper.

831
01:34:02,420 --> 01:34:05,100
You're not the only one knows some shit.

832
01:34:05,300 --> 01:34:07,940
-Where is she?
-The Oakridge Men's Club.

833
01:34:12,260 --> 01:34:13,980
Sorry, moron.

834
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:31,660
Name's Maurice...

835
01:34:33,380 --> 01:34:34,220
...bitch.

836
01:34:39,100 --> 01:34:40,700
Cristal, Ch'u.

837
01:34:41,900 --> 01:34:43,660
You only live once.

838
01:34:45,740 --> 01:34:48,460
Everything's kosher,
down to the last pagoda.

839
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:50,060
You're a good man.

840
01:35:08,660 --> 01:35:10,140
Spend it well.

841
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:21,260
Mr. O'Day.

842
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:22,900
Mr. Ch'u.

843
01:35:23,180 --> 01:35:25,820
You once gave me your condolences.

844
01:35:26,060 --> 01:35:29,260
l now offer mine
in regards to your son.

845
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:33,500
There'll be ample time for you
to express your regrets, Mr. Ch'u.

846
01:35:52,220 --> 01:35:53,740
Amazing.

847
01:35:55,860 --> 01:35:57,180
How much?

848
01:36:01,580 --> 01:36:04,260
So this has been
what it's all about, huh?

849
01:36:05,380 --> 01:36:07,860
l wish my boy could see me do this.

850
01:36:08,260 --> 01:36:10,060
And could be here.

851
01:36:11,140 --> 01:36:12,380
Go ahead and keep that.

852
01:36:17,700 --> 01:36:19,060
l don't understand.

853
01:36:19,780 --> 01:36:21,420
You just acquired another partner.

854
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:25,740
l think it's time the NFL
had a black owner. Don't you?

855
01:36:27,940 --> 01:36:29,740
You're joking, right?

856
01:36:38,780 --> 01:36:40,220
You're not joking.

857
01:36:40,620 --> 01:36:43,380
l'm afraid l already have a partner.
Several, in fact.

858
01:36:43,620 --> 01:36:45,620
Well, you just got another one...

859
01:36:46,220 --> 01:36:47,620
...in fact.

860
01:36:47,820 --> 01:36:51,620
Don't forget, Mr. Roth,
without these deeds...

861
01:36:51,820 --> 01:36:53,260
...you have no....

862
01:36:54,180 --> 01:36:56,500
What is that popular term, Dave?

863
01:36:56,660 --> 01:36:57,780
Cheddar?

864
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:03,180
-Do you mind if l have a moment?
-No, go ahead.

865
01:37:10,220 --> 01:37:11,660
So this is the plan?

866
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:15,140
You wanna be partners with Roth.

867
01:37:17,820 --> 01:37:20,260
l've been waiting for the right time
to tell you.

868
01:37:23,380 --> 01:37:25,900
l'm going to the owner's box.

869
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:28,380
We are going to the owner's box.

870
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:31,620
l ain't playing with these people.

871
01:37:32,980 --> 01:37:34,820
The owner's box.

872
01:37:40,660 --> 01:37:42,700
l've had enough of this legit shit.

873
01:37:44,820 --> 01:37:45,780
What's that?

874
01:37:45,980 --> 01:37:50,260
l believe they call it
corporate restructuring. Right?

875
01:37:52,460 --> 01:37:55,500
lsaak O'Day Development's getting
straight jacked...

876
01:37:55,700 --> 01:37:57,140
...by Machiavellian lnc.

877
01:37:58,180 --> 01:38:00,180
l almost forgot.

878
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:03,300
l'm taking your most valued asset.

879
01:38:07,700 --> 01:38:08,780
You blaze, we blaze.

880
01:38:10,140 --> 01:38:11,420
Are you crazy?

881
01:38:14,580 --> 01:38:17,060
ls she worth $38 million to you?

882
01:38:17,700 --> 01:38:19,540
Now l know you're crazy.

883
01:38:20,620 --> 01:38:25,220
You lost your mind thinking whites would
let you own a piece of their game.

884
01:38:26,220 --> 01:38:28,460
Me and Ch'u had an understanding.

885
01:38:28,660 --> 01:38:32,460
Anybody who didn't sign those deeds,
we took care of.

886
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:34,460
What do you mean?

887
01:38:34,660 --> 01:38:37,460
Daddy, l was there
when he killed Silk.

888
01:38:38,060 --> 01:38:42,020
So now after everything,
you really gonna try to do this?

889
01:38:42,260 --> 01:38:45,700
l have been covering your ass
for years, lsaak.

890
01:38:46,300 --> 01:38:49,260
Quite frankly,
l am just tired of being your boy.

891
01:38:49,940 --> 01:38:52,420
You think because you put your kids
through college...

892
01:38:52,620 --> 01:38:56,140
...that it's supposed to make all
your crooked straight?

893
01:38:56,780 --> 01:38:59,780
Man, you want to own a damn box.

894
01:39:00,420 --> 01:39:02,980
Mac just want to own the streets.

895
01:39:03,660 --> 01:39:05,940
That's always been your problem.

896
01:39:07,780 --> 01:39:08,860
What about Colin?

897
01:39:09,060 --> 01:39:10,620
What about him?

898
01:39:13,060 --> 01:39:14,020
You killed Colin?

899
01:39:16,820 --> 01:39:20,100
Even fake wars have casualties, lsaak.

900
01:39:20,980 --> 01:39:22,820
l guess old Collard Green couldn't fly.

901
01:40:21,700 --> 01:40:23,300
Damn it, Roth!

902
01:40:23,620 --> 01:40:24,620
Watch her.

903
01:41:13,060 --> 01:41:14,020
Go get it!

904
01:41:29,660 --> 01:41:30,660
Take it down!

905
01:41:34,140 --> 01:41:35,700
Take it down now!

906
01:41:35,940 --> 01:41:37,100
No way!

907
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:38,740
Take it down!

908
01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:53,780
Why did you kill my brother?

909
01:41:56,780 --> 01:41:59,460
All that Chinese shit
happened in-house.

910
01:42:00,540 --> 01:42:02,780
You have your own people
to thank for that.

911
01:42:06,380 --> 01:42:07,820
Not that you'll get the chance.

912
01:42:09,420 --> 01:42:12,300
Sorry, Romeo, but you gotta die.

913
01:42:17,980 --> 01:42:19,140
Damn...

914
01:42:20,060 --> 01:42:21,700
...that's some cold shit.

915
01:42:30,780 --> 01:42:32,260
We've called the police.

916
01:42:32,540 --> 01:42:35,140
-There's an ambulance on its way.
-Thank you.

917
01:42:35,380 --> 01:42:37,340
l'm all right, baby.
How you feeling?

918
01:42:37,540 --> 01:42:40,140
You doing all right?
l'm doing all right.

919
01:42:42,380 --> 01:42:43,740
ls that Han?

920
01:42:44,220 --> 01:42:45,220
Yes.

921
01:42:45,740 --> 01:42:48,740
You're the one who's been
making all this trouble, huh?

922
01:42:50,700 --> 01:42:52,460
Let me shake your hand.

923
01:42:56,700 --> 01:42:58,620
You got a firm grip. l like that.

924
01:43:00,300 --> 01:43:01,940
Stay with your father.

925
01:43:02,180 --> 01:43:03,540
l will.

926
01:43:08,180 --> 01:43:10,020
He a lot shorter than l thought.

927
01:43:10,220 --> 01:43:12,020
-l know.
-He just a little guy.

928
01:43:12,220 --> 01:43:14,060
l don't know what to do with you.

929
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:43,780
Your brother wasn't suited to lead.

930
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:48,780
He didn't have the discipline.

931
01:43:50,060 --> 01:43:51,260
That's why you killed him.

932
01:43:51,460 --> 01:43:53,300
That's why l had to.

933
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:55,140
''Had to''?

934
01:43:57,460 --> 01:43:58,540
My brother.

935
01:44:00,340 --> 01:44:01,420
That's right.

936
01:44:02,580 --> 01:44:03,820
That...

937
01:44:04,380 --> 01:44:05,740
...was a mistake.

938
01:44:06,100 --> 01:44:07,100
Come on.

939
01:45:34,780 --> 01:45:35,740
Come on!

940
01:45:41,780 --> 01:45:43,220
Give me some skin! Come on!

941
01:50:06,020 --> 01:50:07,380
Are you okay?

942
01:50:08,260 --> 01:50:09,700
l'm okay.

943
01:50:22,460 --> 01:50:23,900
Come on, let's go.
