00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:23,564
十一月
It is November.

3
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,566
一輪明月升起
A full moon rises.

4
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:32,114
約40萬公里之遙的地球彷彿中了魔法一般
Almost 400,000 kilometers away, Planet Earth falls under its spell.

5
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:39,580
海波微動
Our oceans stir.

6
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:43,375
正在進行一場古老的海底儀式
An ancient undersea ritual is underway.

7
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,733
這件事的結果
The outcome of this event

8
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,819
不僅影響周圍海水中的海洋生物
will not only affect marine life in the surrounding waters,

9
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,780
而且也會給我們一個關於
but will also give us a clue

10
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:16,158
整個海洋系統狀況的線索
about the health of the entire ocean system.

11
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:22,456
主角生物就是珊瑚
The creature responsible is coral.

12
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:26,043
這是珊瑚的故事
And this is coral's story.

13
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,548
故事伴隨著大量珊瑚產卵
The story begins here,

14
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:35,552
這一難以置信的場景開始
with the incredible phenomenon that is mass coral spawning.

15
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:40,641
這是由太陽和月亮控制的年度大事
It's an annual event, cued by the sun and the moon.

16
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:44,353
它涉及超過140個不同物種
It involves over 140 different species,

17
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,815
並且已經持續了數千年之久
and has been occurring for thousands of years.

18
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,778
儘管珊瑚沒有大腦和眼睛
Although corals have no brain and no eyes,

19
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:56,156
但單一物種卻能同時繁殖
somehow individual species spawn together,

20
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,992
有時就在幾分鐘之內
sometimes down to the minute.

21
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,208
就像微型情書
Like tiny love-letters,

22
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:09,795
基因物質混入洋流
the genetic material is cast into the ocean currents,

23
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,465
連接數千公里長的珊瑚礁
connecting reefs over hundreds of kilometers.

24
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:25,894
像我們一樣，珊瑚花9個月準備繁殖
Like us, corals take up to nine months to prepare for birth.

25
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:31,775
但很多是雌雄同體，所以它們同時釋放卵子和精子
But many are hermaphrodites, so they gestate both egg and sperm.

26
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:34,027
在產卵之夜
On spawning night,

27
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:38,740
它們聚成團塊，並從珊瑚嘴中釋放出來
these are grouped into bundles and delivered through the coral's mouth.

28
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,162
對大多數來說，這是一次無痛的出生
For most, it's a gentle birth.

29
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:05,392
這一大團很快就分裂開
Over a short time-span, the bundles break apart

30
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,397
卵子和精子必須從其它地方找到它們的另一半
and the egg and sperm must find their counterparts from another colony.

31
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,903
數十億里只有很少能存活下來
Billions set forth, but few survive.

32
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:23,452
很多其它生物用同樣方法繁殖
Many other creatures choose the same conditions to spawn

33
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,537
礁脈中的水流變成了
and the reef waters are transformed

34
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:30,584
一個巨大的充滿精子和卵子的液態子宮
into a vast liquid womb, clouded with eggs and sperm.

35
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:41,094
大規模產卵使潛在的捕食者忙不過來
Mass spawning overwhelms potential predators,

36
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:46,892
這使珊瑚卵有更多機會受精並佔領一片新天地
so the coral eggs have more chance to be fertilized and begin a new colony.

37
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:53,815
白天，巨大的光滑海面標記出它們的路線
By daybreak, vast slicks on the surface mark their passage.

38
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,784
珊瑚不僅是水下建築師
Coral is an architect not only of the undersea world,

39
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,786
在水面上也同樣
but above the surface too.

40
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,788
死去的珊瑚掉落沙中
Dead coral breaks down into sand

41
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:12,042
並最終形成珊瑚礁
that eventually builds up to create coral cays.

42
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:23,011
這些海岸和淺灘為許多
These shores and shallows provide sanctuary -

43
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:27,849
別的生物提供庇護所和重要的繁殖地
and important breeding grounds - for a variety of other creatures.

44
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:50,163
總而言之，數百萬年來，造礁珊瑚
All told, reef-building corals have colonized every tropical ocean,

45
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:54,001
佔領了每一片熱帶海域，塑造並保護了數千公里的海岸線
shaped and protected thousands of kilometers of coastline

46
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:58,797
還影響了海洋的演化
and influenced marine evolution for millions of years.

47
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,725
鳥類，比如這些燕鷗
Birds like these noddy terns

48
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:14,813
依靠珊瑚礁提供食物，珊瑚環島提供棲地
rely on coral reefs for food and coral cays for shelter.

49
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:22,029
鳥類排泄出種子，使植物在此生長
Birds help vegetate cays by depositing seeds.

50
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:25,699
這些種子長成樹和森林
These seeds grow into trees and forests

51
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:29,828
它們反過來又為鳥類提供築巢的場所
which in turn provide the birds with nesting sites.

52
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:51,516
熱帶海鳥常來光顧這些多沙的邊遠之地
These sandy outposts are frequented by many tropical seabirds,

53
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:57,022
一些成對的鳥會返回相同的築巢點，年復一年
with some pairs returning to the same nesting sites year after year.

54
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:11,578
原始珊瑚可追溯到四億五千萬年前
Primitive corals date back over 450 million years.

55
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:17,209
現代造礁珊瑚則出現在大約兩億五千萬年前
Modern reef-building corals first emerged around 250 million years ago

56
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,670
從此，珊瑚礁為不計其數的
and their reefs have provided homes and sustenance

57
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:23,507
物種提供家園和食物
for innumerable species ever since.

58
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:32,057
在珊瑚的漫長歷史中，經歷過五次大滅絕
Over coral's long history, five mass extinctions have come and gone.

59
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:36,937
每次都有超過90%的生命形態消失
During each, up to 90% of all life-forms perished.

60
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,857
其中的兩次
Two of these extinctions

61
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:44,361
發生在現代造礁珊瑚崛起時
occurred during the rise of modern reef-building corals.

62
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:49,491
它們並沒有失去活力，而是存活下來
Rather than falter, they somehow survived,

63
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,410
重塑岸礁
rebuilt their reefs

64
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,663
並再次改變了海洋
and transformed the oceans anew.

65
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,796
現在，珊瑚礁生態系統是許多標誌性
Today, coral reef ecosystems are important nursery grounds

66
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:07,426
海洋生物的重要繁殖地，如海龜
for many iconic marine animals, such as the sea turtle.

67
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,928
有7種海龜
There are seven species of sea turtle

68
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,473
壽命很長且生長緩慢
and all are long-lived and slow-growing.

69
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:19,396
它們需要10到30年才能性成熟並在海洋中交配
They take between 10 to 30 years to sexually mature and mate at sea.

70
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,566
這些海洋爬行動物一生中
These marine reptiles are nomadic

71
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,861
要在海洋中遊歷數千公里
and swim thousands of kilometers during their lives.

72
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:30,240
但強烈的本能和謎一樣的自然力量引導著它們
But strong instinct and mysterious natural forces guide them,

73
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:33,160
以致當雌龜要產卵時
so that when a female needs to lay her eggs,

74
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:38,707
會回到它出生的海灘
she returns to the very beach where she was born to do so.

75
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:46,006
她在沙地上挖洞作為孵化室
Here, she digs a nest and coral sand becomes the womb.

76
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:52,053
數百隻蛋孵化，卻只有一兩個能長到成年
Hundreds hatch, but only one or two will make it to adulthood.

77
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:55,640
然後它們可以存活一個世紀
They can then live for up to a century.

78
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,609
如果有只100年前出生的海龜
When a turtle hatched 100 years ago,

79
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:10,113
它會目睹珊瑚礁的全盛時期
it would have seen the world's coral reefs in all their glory.

80
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:13,658
工業文明前的海是清澈乾淨的
Pre-industrial seas were clean and clear

81
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:18,246
數百萬年來，珊瑚擁有良好的生長環境
and corals had enjoyed good conditions for millions of years.

82
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:21,583
從印度洋到太平洋
Throughout the Indian and Pacific oceans,

83
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,085
從加勒比海到西大西洋
and into the Caribbean and west Atlantic,

84
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:26,171
珊瑚礁茁壯成長
reefs were thriving.

85
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:35,305
年輕的海龜遊歷於珊瑚礁之中
The turtle spent its youth exploring these reefs

86
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:39,059
並見證了珊瑚創造的工程奇跡
and witnessed the engineering marvel that is coral.

87
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:44,314
通過利用太陽能和完美的回收機制
By harnessing the power of the sun and perfecting recycling,

88
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:49,694
珊瑚建造了使人類自愧弗如的節能都市
coral built energy-efficient cities that put many of ours to shame.

89
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:53,782
這些都市聚集在一起成為巨大的帝國
Collectively, these cities created vast empires,

90
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,618
有些從外太空都能看見
some visible from outer space.

91
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:06,586
在這裡，海龜發現自己有很多夥伴
Here, the turtle found itself in great company,

92
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:12,467
因為這些海底帝國是許多海洋生物的家園
for these undersea empires were home to vast numbers of marine species

93
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:16,054
任何形狀，任何體型，只要你想像得到
of every imaginable shape and size

94
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,140
這裡是個熱鬧非凡，五彩繽紛的世界
and were crowded, colorful places.

95
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:30,110
在眾生態系統中，珊瑚礁是最富生物多樣性的
Today, reefs have one of the highest levels of biodiversity

96
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,112
地方之一
of any ecosystem

97
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,741
也是地球上對生物學研究最重要的地區之一
and are some of the most biologically important places on Earth.

98
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:46,626
海龜和珊瑚共同目睹了
Together, turtles and corals have witnessed many changes

99
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,878
水下世界的變化
to their watery world.

100
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:51,047
它們是在6500萬年前發生的
They are some of the only beings

101
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:54,384
最後一次大滅絕事件中
to have survived the last mass extinction event

102
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,220
倖存下來的生物
65 million years ago.

103
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,224
科學家預測在下個世紀
Scientists predict that in the coming century,

104
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,226
它們將會面臨比上次大滅絕
they will face ocean conditions

105
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:06,980
更具災難性的海洋環境
as catastrophic as during that last extinction.

106
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:12,027
精明的老海龜已經看到了警告
Wise old turtles have seen the warning signs for a while.

107
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:19,784
全世界70%的珊瑚礁已經被毀滅
70% of the world's reefs have already been destroyed

108
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,037
或被嚴重威脅
or are seriously threatened.

109
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,710
七種海龜中有六種
And all but one of the seven sea turtle species

110
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:32,547
被列為瀕危或非常接近滅絕
are classified 'endangered' or 'critically endangered'.

111
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,801
幾百萬年來第一次
For the first time in millions of years,

112
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:41,097
海龜和珊瑚的未來變得那麼不確定
the future of both turtle and coral is uncertain.

113
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,655
珊瑚礁的健康狀況受許多因素影響
Many things affect the health of coral reefs,

114
00:10:56,822 --> 00:11:02,077
特別是水溫，海平面高度和海水成分
in particular, sea temperature, sea level and water chemistry.

115
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:08,375
珊瑚礁可能看起來很堅固，但珊瑚本身很脆弱
Reefs may look mighty, but corals themselves are fragile

116
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:13,004
它們會因環境的細小變化而受到致命傷害
and can be fatally harmed by just subtle changes in their environment.

117
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:19,969
當海平面上升過快時，珊瑚生長不夠快
When sea levels rise too rapidly, corals can't grow fast enough

118
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,305
導致珊瑚礁被淹沒
and reefs drown.

119
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:25,600
由於大氣中二氧化碳含量增加
As atmospheric carbon dioxide levels increase,

120
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:30,814
海洋酸化加劇，珊瑚礁將會溶解
ocean acidification intensifies and reefs will dissolve.

121
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:42,617
海水溫度持續升高1-2℃時
And a sustained increase of only 1-2 degrees in ocean temperature

122
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,662
會導致珊瑚白化並死亡
can cause corals to bleach and die.

123
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:50,208
據預測，全球氣溫將在本世紀末
By the end of this century, it's predicted that the global climate

124
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,962
升高5°C甚至更多
could be 5 degrees Celsius hotter or more.

125
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:59,050
按照這一速度，珊瑚白化每年都會發生
At this rate, bleaching will become an annual occurrence,

126
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:03,304
這多姿多彩的美景將最終消逝
and this colorful landscape will literally fade away.

127
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,419
健康的珊瑚礁很容易被看到
A healthy coral reef is easy to spot.

128
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:41,384
這是個充滿色彩，多樣性和生命活動的複雜結構
A complex structure awash with color, variety and activity.

129
00:12:56,692 --> 00:13:01,988
這個複雜的熱帶花園能與陸地上任何事物匹敵
This is a tangled, tropical garden to rival anything on land.

130
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,368
這花園中最令人驚異的是
Most amazing about this garden

131
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:11,790
許多「植物」其實是動物
is that many of the 'plants' are actually animals.

132
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,586
像緊握的手掌
Like grasping hands,

133
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:20,340
珊瑚的嘴貪婪地過濾水流篩選食物
coral mouths hungrily sift the passing currents for food

134
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,008
不分晝夜
day and night.

135
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:36,147
我們所說的「珊瑚」是一種原始的囊狀水螅
The creature we call 'coral' is a primitive sac-like polyp,

136
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,483
一部分是動物，一部分是植物
part animal, part plant.

137
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,277
動物部分以浮游生物為食
The animal part feeds on plankton.

138
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:44,697
植物部分由細微的水藻—蟲黃藻—構成
The plant part consists of microscopic algae -

139
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:49,494
利用陽光進行光合作用
called zooxanthellae - that photosynthesize using sunlight.

140
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:53,039
每隻水螅都和周圍連成一片
Each polyp is connected to its neighbor,

141
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,543
傳遞能量與營養
passing along energy and nutrients.

142
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,004
它們不斷繁衍創造新領地
These polyps multiply to create colonies,

143
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,966
並結合起來形成珊瑚礁
which combine to form reefs.

144
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:10,765
通過這種方式，整個生態系統的能量
In this way, energy is produced, shared and recycled

145
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,560
得以生產，分享及循環
throughout the entire ecosystem.

146
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:29,033
利用它們生產的能量，珊瑚不僅蓬勃發展
With the energy they produce, corals not only thrive

147
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,161
而且製造出用來建造珊瑚礁的
but also manufacture calcium carbonate,

148
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:35,623
特殊「混凝土」，碳酸鈣
the special 'concrete' that builds reefs.

149
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:40,211
這是隱藏在珊瑚巨大帝國建築背後的秘密之一
This is one secret behind corals' great empire building.

150
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,214
另一個是無性繁殖
The other is budding.

151
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,967
無性繁殖就是珊瑚蟲複製一個
Budding is a process where coral polyps produce

152
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,012
和自己的基因完全相同的副本
genetically identical copies of themselves

153
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:52,390
不需要產卵就可拓展它們的領地
and extend their colonies without spawning.

154
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:05,194
硬珊瑚分泌出碳酸鈣基底
The calcium carbonate foundation secreted by hard corals

155
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:08,281
有些地方的基底有悠久的歷史
can be one kilometer thick in places

156
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,867
並可能達到一公里厚
and hundreds of thousands of years old.

157
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:16,331
我們看到的活礁石只是最上面的薄薄一層
The living reef we see today is just a thin veneer on top,

158
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,167
由許多不同的物種構成
made up of many different species,

159
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,586
包括軟珊瑚…
including soft corals...

160
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,052
…扇珊瑚
..fan corals...

161
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:39,771
…海綿，柳珊瑚和海百合
..and sponges, gorgonians and crinoids.

162
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:47,487
眾所周知，珊瑚已經進化出1000多種硬珊瑚
All told, coral has evolved into more than 1,000 hard coral species

163
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,073
700多種軟珊瑚
and over 700 soft corals,

164
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,410
每一種都將自己放在合適的地方
each perfectly specialized to fill its own niche.

165
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:05,129
瞭解珊瑚礁的形成
Understanding how corals build reefs

166
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,799
突顯了氣候變化的嚴重性
highlights the seriousness of climate change

167
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,094
以及它如何威脅這複雜的生態系統
and how it threatens this complex ecosystem.

168
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:17,850
海洋像巨大的海綿，一直在吸收大氣中的二氧化碳
Our oceans have always absorbed atmospheric CO2 like a giant sponge.

169
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:23,106
但現在二氧化碳含量過高，導致水中化學成分改變
But now those levels are so high that the water chemistry is changing -

170
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:27,193
這個過程被稱作「海洋酸化」
a process referred to as 'ocean acidification'.

171
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,904
堿度降低
Alkalinity is falling

172
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:34,450
自然存在的碳酸根離子受到影響
and naturally-occurring carbonate ions are being affected.

173
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:39,038
許多海洋生物需要這些離子製造碳酸鈣
Many marine creatures need these ions to produce calcium carbonate

174
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,916
來形成它們的外殼及骨架
for their shells and skeletons.

175
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,879
硬珊瑚需要它們來建造珊瑚礁
Hard corals need them to build reefs.

176
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:53,845
海洋酸化嚴重威脅到所有這些過程
Ocean acidification seriously threatens all these processes.

177
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:03,354
但每一個自然災害中，有贏家也有輸家
But in every natural catastrophe, there are winners and losers.

178
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,150
水母是珊瑚的遠親
Jellyfish are distant relatives of coral,

179
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,819
但不像珊瑚，它們更適應
but unlike coral, they are more adaptable

180
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:13,573
水溫和化學變化
to changes in water temperature and chemistry.

181
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:17,201
它們的數量還在上升
Their numbers are already on the rise.

182
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,955
讓我們的海水變得蜇人
And they are making our seas sting.

183
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:30,715
珊瑚的另一個古代表親是海葵
Coral's other ancient cousin is the sea anemone.

184
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,175
與珊瑚一樣
Like coral,

185
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:36,054
海葵是非常成功的簡單生物
the anemone is a simple being that has been highly successful.

186
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,975
事實上，海葵就像一隻巨大的珊瑚蟲
In fact, the anemone is like a huge coral polyp.

187
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,102
它的中心是一張大嘴
At its center is a mouth

188
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,773
圍繞著一大片帶刺的觸手
surrounded by a vast mantle of stinging tentacles.

189
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:51,402
它的嘴裡有一個充滿酸性酶的巨大的胃
Within the mouth is a big stomach filled with acidic enzymes.

190
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:56,282
因為海葵沒有堅實的身體結構或骨架
Because the anemone does not have a solid physical structure or skeleton,

191
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,993
不依賴於碳酸鈣
it does not rely on calcium carbonate,

192
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:03,039
所以面對海洋酸化，它們不像珊瑚那麼脆弱
so it's not as vulnerable as coral to ocean acidification.

193
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:08,086
但與珊瑚一樣，變暖的海水會使一些
But, like coral, some species possess zooxanthellae algae

194
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:12,381
含有蟲黃藻的品種白化
and warming seas will also cause them to bleach.

195
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:22,016
在800多種海葵中
There are over 800 species of sea anemone.

196
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:25,144
有10種是適合小丑魚居住的
10 are suitable homes for anemone fish

197
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:29,398
這是珊瑚礁中最奇妙的夥伴關係之一
and this is one of the reef's most marvelous partnerships.

198
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,987
海葵的觸手通常會刺痛入侵者
The anemone's tentacles normally sting invaders.

199
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:38,491
但小丑魚身上有保護粘液
But these fish are coated with a protective mucus

200
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,619
使它們可以進進出出而不受傷害
and can dance in and out unharmed.

201
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,832
小丑魚很少閒逛到一米以外
The fish rarely wander more than a meter away.

202
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,292
它們需要的所有東西都在這兒
Everything they need is right here -

203
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,046
食物，保護和集聚群體
scraps of food, protection and community.

204
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,722
沒有什麼可驚奇的
Not surprisingly,

205
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,351
這種魚在海葵保護範圍附近產卵
the fish lay their eggs near the protective folds of the anemone,

206
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,105
供氧並保護它們直至孵化
aerating and defending them until they hatch.

207
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:32,211
限制在一處並沒有影響它們的性生活
And being stuck in one place hasn't harmed their sex life.

208
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,839
事實上，它們適應了這種生活
In fact, it's enhanced it.

209
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:42,722
為了讓所有人滿意，它們學會了變性
To keep everyone satisfied, they've mastered sex change.

210
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:49,478
如果需要雌性家長，雄性變性
If a dominant female is required, a male can change sex.

211
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,480
如果需要雄性家長
If a dominant male is needed,

212
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:55,401
低級別雄性會加速性成熟
a subordinate male accelerates into sexual maturity.

213
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:08,039
隨著海洋環境的變化，小丑魚似乎比大多數種類受到更好的保護
As ocean conditions change, anemone fish seem more protected than most,

214
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,791
它們在帶刺武器的懷抱中很安全
safe within those stinging arms.

215
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:19,091
但是即使它們也不能免受威脅
But even they are not immune from danger.

216
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:23,512
所有魚類的內部結構和器官
All fish have internal structures and organs

217
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,807
會隨海洋酸化而衰弱
which may be weakened by ocean acidification.

218
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,147
現在，科學家發現
Even now, scientists are finding

219
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:36,067
魚類的耳骨受到損傷
that the ear bones of fish are being affected,

220
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,070
這影響到它們的溝通方式
which is impacting the way they communicate.

221
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:45,743
如果海洋酸化不被遏制
If ocean acidification goes unchecked,

222
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:51,332
它會影響所有海洋動物的代謝過程
it may affect key metabolic processes for all marine animals.

223
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,133
當狀況變得更具挑戰性
Whenever conditions get more challenging,

224
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:05,763
自然選擇的過程會更加殘酷
the natural process of selection just gets more ruthless.

225
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:10,017
無法應對的會被迅速淘汰
Those that cannot cope will be quickly cast aside.

226
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:14,313
每個居民都必須爭取它的生存
Every citizen must earn its keep.

227
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:24,740
這些蝦集合的地點稱為「清潔場」
These shrimp gather in locations referred to as 'cleaning stations'.

228
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:29,662
這個特殊的地方恰巧也是海鰻的家
This particular station also happens to be the home of a moray eel.

229
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,165
但小蝦不逃跑
But the shrimp aren't running away.

230
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,627
如果可以的話，它們相互競爭以靠得更近
If anything, they're competing to get closer.

231
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:40,506
雖然海鰻覺得它們很煩人
And although the eel finds the shrimp irritating,

232
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,050
它也只能苦笑著忍受
he just grins and bears it.

233
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,558
這些完全不同的物種
The reason why these entirely different species

234
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,018
相互容忍的原因是
tolerate one another

235
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:55,104
它們有個心照不宣的協議
is because they have an unspoken agreement.

236
00:21:56,148 --> 00:22:00,026
蝦需要承擔清除寄生蟲
The shrimp has the important job of removing parasites

237
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:02,570
和腐肉的重要工作
as well as dying or dead flesh.

238
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,781
這些對海鰻來說是致命的
These can be fatal to the moray,

239
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:09,410
卻為蝦提供了豐盛大餐
but provide a delicious banquet for the shrimp.

240
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:19,128
動物們忙於應對珊瑚礁中的複雜關係
Animals are engaged in complex relationships right across the reef.

241
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,132
單打獨鬥是非常冒險的
Going solo is risky business.

242
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:27,094
如果要嘗試，你最好聰明些
And if you're going to attempt it, you'd better be very clever.

243
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:31,891
其中一個聰明的生存戰術就是偽裝
One clever survival tactic is camouflage.

244
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:37,438
裝飾蟹把海綿，珊瑚，海葵附到它的殼上
Decorator crabs attach tiny sponges, corals and anemones to their shells

245
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:40,858
看上去更像一個行走的花盆
and look more like walking flowerbeds than animals.

246
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:47,823
其它的試圖通過將有毒海綿放頭上來隱匿
Others attempt to go incognito by placing toxic sponges on their heads,

247
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:51,410
像這些名副其實的帶帽蟹
like these aptly-named hat-carrying crabs.

248
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:58,042
海綿是活的生物，但蟹可不在乎
Sponges are living creatures, but the crab doesn't care,

249
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,253
它們把海綿切成合適自己體型的尺寸
cutting the sponge up into whatever size fits.

250
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,133
其他蟹收集海藻葉
Other crabs collect forest leaves

251
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:10,596
用作偽裝和懸掛式滑翔器
and use them for disguise and as hang-gliders.

252
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,564
拳擊蟹把微小的毒海葵當做拳擊手套
Boxer crabs are always ready for a fight,

253
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:24,068
隨時準備戰鬥
with tiny poisonous anemones as boxing gloves.

254
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:30,699
寄居蟹披掛二手外殼來加固自己的防彈衣
Hermit crabs reinforce their own body armor by wearing second-hand shells.

255
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:32,993
隨著蟹的成長
Bigger shells must be found

256
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,620
它們必須找到更大的外殼
as the crab grows

257
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:38,999
這讓它們有很多塑造獨特外形的機會
and this gives the crab lots of time to develop its own unique look.

258
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:46,424
許多老道的寄居蟹尋找帶刺的海葵
More sophisticated hermit crabs collect stinging anemones

259
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:49,468
換殼的時候把它們弄下來
and will remove these anemones and reattach them

260
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:52,179
並放到新外殼上
whenever they change shells.

261
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:08,654
蟹類歷史可追溯到2億年之前的侏羅紀時代
Crabs date back to Jurassic times 200 million years ago

262
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:12,116
現存種類超過一萬個
and over 10,000 species exist.

263
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:17,371
它們很頑強，即使少了四條腿也不會使它們慢下來
They're hardy souls - even missing half their legs won't slow them down.

264
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,791
它們還是機會主義者
And they're great opportunists -

265
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:24,128
有些在海參的嘴裡尋找食物
some feasting inside a sea cucumber's mouth.

266
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:31,010
海參有些非凡的身體適應性
Sea cucumbers have some remarkable physical adaptations themselves.

267
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,179
它們通過尾部呼吸
They breathe through their rear end,

268
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:36,182
通過管足利用水壓前進
move on hydraulically-powered tube feet,

269
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:39,018
海參體壁有一種特殊的膠原蛋白
and have a special collagen in their body wall

270
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:42,229
使它們能夠迅速改變身體形狀
that enables them to radically change shape.

271
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,859
它們從身體前部產卵
They also spawn from their forehead.

272
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:59,455
海參很少有天敵
Sea cucumbers have few natural predators.

273
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:04,168
難怪蝦蟹喜歡把它們當做出租車
So it's no wonder they're a popular taxi ride for crabs and shrimp.

274
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:08,172
因為海參用身體前端挑起食物
Because the sea cucumber stirs up food with its front end,

275
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,217
蝦蟹甚至能獲得一份免費的食物
there's even a free meal as part of the ticket.

276
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,641
裸腮軟體動物也非常適合搭便車
Nudibranchs are also great to hitchhike.

277
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,935
這些劇毒的海蛞蝓
These highly poisonous sea slugs

278
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:25,481
在通過危險開闊地時提供安全通道
offer guaranteed safe passage through dangerous open territory,

279
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,150
蝦則在路上負責清潔
with the shrimps scavenging on the run.

280
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,320
但對第一流的旅行來說
But for first-class travel,

281
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:34,949
沒什麼比得上噴水推進式的水母
nothing compares to a jet-propelled jellyfish.

282
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:52,424
魔毯在珊瑚上方滑過，以扁蟲的形式
Magic carpets also glide above the reef, in the form of flatworms.

283
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,431
扁蟲和裸腮軟體動物沒有外殼
Flatworms and nudibranchs don't have shells,

284
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,726
所以利用化學戰保護自己
so draw on chemical warfare as defense.

285
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,604
有些吃有毒的水螅和海葵
Some eat toxic hydroids and anemones

286
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:08,315
並將毒素隔離在皮膚內
and sequester poison in their skin,

287
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:12,403
這使它們對潛在的獵食者來說具有毒性
which in turn makes them poisonous to any potential predator.

288
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:18,158
明亮鮮艷的顏色與圖案宣告它們的毒性
They advertise their toxicity with bright, bold colors and patterns,

289
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:22,371
也使它們美麗非凡
which have conspired to make them incredibly beautiful.

290
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:46,687
和外貌一樣，它們的性格也同樣狂野
They are as wild in character as they are in appearance.

291
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:50,482
腮在背上，性器官在兩邊
They have gills on their backs, sex organs on their sides

292
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,444
它們都是雌雄同體
and all of them are hermaphrodites.

293
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,907
還有些是同類相食的
And some are fierce cannibals.

294
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:06,081
試圖在交配中吃掉你的愛人是難以接受的
Trying to eat your lover during sex is not quite acceptable,

295
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:09,293
但吃個表親還是可以的
but snacking on a cousin is fine.

296
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:26,226
海星和海蛞蝓一樣居住在海底
Joining the sea slugs on the ocean's floor are the sea stars.

297
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:35,861
海星常被稱作「星魚」
Sea stars are often referred to as starfish,

298
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:39,114
但它們完全不是魚類，它們是棘皮動物
but they're not fish at all, they're echinoderms.

299
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:44,828
棘皮動物可追溯到5億年前
Echinoderms date back over 500 million years,

300
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,790
比珊瑚的演變早
so predate the evolution of coral.

301
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:51,126
它們進化出很多生命形式
They have evolved into a wide range of life forms

302
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:54,755
共同點是棘刺
and what many have in common is the spine.

303
00:27:57,008 --> 00:28:00,010
海膽全身是刺
Urchins are some of the most heavily spined of all,

304
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:05,099
但對於色彩協調的蝦和蟹，這並不是威脅
but for some color-coordinated crabs and shrimp, this isn't a deterrent.

305
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:08,352
它們已經適應在刺與刺的間隙生活
They've adapted to live amongst the spines

306
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,813
並一生都在那裡
and remain there all their lives.

307
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:18,612
這是珊瑚礁中典型的共生案例
It's a classic case of symbiosis on a reef and worlds within worlds.

308
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:33,293
熱帶海洋就像藍色沙漠，非常缺少營養
Tropical oceans are like vast blue deserts and largely nutrient poor.

309
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:36,588
在珊瑚礁中，什麼都不能浪費
On coral reefs, nothing goes to waste.

310
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:39,550
這裡進化出各種專業濾食性動物
Various specialist filter feeders have evolved

311
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,885
篩過流經的水流
to sift the passing currents -

312
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:47,391
捕捉，消化並回收每一塊食物
capturing, digesting and recycling every available bit of food.

313
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:58,736
在所有濾食性動物中，蠕蟲是數量和種類最多的
Worms are among the most numerous and diverse of all filter feeders.

314
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:01,822
現存有2萬個海洋種類
20,000 marine species exist

315
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:06,326
與陸地上的蠕蟲不同，它們是有毒的束狀物
and, unlike the earth worms, they're an exotic bunch.

316
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,997
就如它們的名字
Befitting their name,

317
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:14,293
聖誕樹蠕蟲打開它節日羽毛般的口器
Christmas-tree worms unfurl festive, feathery mouth parts,

318
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,045
把它們當做細小的網
which they use like tiny nets.

319
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:21,300
它們的身體埋在珊瑚礁之中，很少能看見
Their bodies, meanwhile, are buried in the coral and rarely seen.

320
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,272
同樣難得一見的是藍帶鰻
Equally shy are ribbon eels.

321
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,525
它們一生中大部分時間躲在洞穴中
They spend most of their time concealed in deep burrows,

322
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,903
只有頭伸出來
with just their heads peeking out.

323
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,238
它們是海鰻的親戚
They're relatives of moray eels

324
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:46,033
張開的嘴使它們看起來具有進攻性
and their gaping mouths make them look aggressive.

325
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,576
但它們僅僅在呼吸
But they're simply breathing,

326
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:51,205
誇張的鼻孔是在嗅找食物
with their exaggerated nostrils sniffing for food.

327
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:01,173
採用同樣生活方式的是花園鰻
Adopting the same lifestyle are garden eels.

328
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:12,100
大群纖細的花園鰻從沙中升起
These delicate sea serpents rise from the sand in vast communities,

329
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:15,979
表演催眠印度蛇舞
performing their hypnotic Indian snake dance.

330
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:24,822
它們對掠食者保持警惕
Ever watchful for predators,

331
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:28,408
從經過的水流中緊張地採食浮游生物
they nervously pluck plankton from passing currents,

332
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:31,161
並用尾巴將自己固定住
their tails anchoring them down.

333
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:41,713
由於珊瑚的漫長歷史
Because of corals' longevity on our planet,

334
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:44,675
它們被當做活化石
they're considered our living fossils.

335
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:50,430
另一個活化石是鸚鵡螺
Another living fossil still with us today is the nautilus.

336
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:55,310
它是一種古老的軟體動物，當軟體動物最終丟掉外殼
It's an ancient mollusk, whose line eventually dropped its shell...

337
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:02,276
就帶來了頭足類動物的時代
..and gave rise to the age of the cephalopods.

338
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,323
有珊瑚礁的地方就有頭足動物
Cephalopods are synonymous with the reef

339
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:12,035
擬態章魚是最有趣的動物之一
and one of the most intriguing is the mimic octopus.

340
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:17,583
如同它名字中暗示的
As its name implies,

341
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:21,545
它模仿超過15種動物
the octopus mimics the physical likeness and movements

342
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,423
外表和行動方式
of more than 15 different species,

343
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:30,929
包括海蛇，獅子魚，鰈魚和鬼蟹
including sea snakes, lionfish, flounder and ghost crabs.

344
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:35,475
它是自然中最偉大的柔術演員
It's one of nature's great contortionists.

345
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:39,563
如果它不想被看到，那就肯定不會
If it doesn't want to be seen, it certainly won't be.

346
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:56,538
許多種章魚都生活在珊瑚礁附近
Many species of octopus live in the vicinity of reefs

347
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:59,625
真正的珊瑚礁專家是它
and a true reef specialist is this -

348
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:01,877
晝章魚
the day octopus.

349
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:10,510
這種章魚是偉大的獵手，魚兒們匆忙保護它們的卵
These octopus are great hunters and fish hurry to defend their eggs.

350
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,763
章魚是如此貪吃
And being so tasty themselves,

351
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:17,142
這使它們不得不發展出高明的捕獵技巧
octopus have had to develop excellent martial arts skills.

352
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:29,363
它們有無脊椎動物中最為複雜的大腦
They have the most complex brain of any invertebrate

353
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:33,659
能同時處理全部八條觸手傳遞的信息
and can process information from all eight arms at once.

354
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:41,124
它們有短期和長期記憶
They have short as well as long-term memory

355
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:45,629
並具備通過皮膚進行溝通的特殊方式
and possess a special way to communicate with their skin.

356
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,894
同時高度互動，觸覺性良好
They're also highly interactive and tactile.

357
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,647
求愛儀式可持續數小時
Courtship rituals can last for hours,

358
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:08,944
一對章魚將16條觸手緊緊抱在一起
with couples intertwining all 16 arms in a sticky embrace.

359
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:22,708
一旦交配完成，它們將逐漸死去
Once they mate, their bodies are programmed to die.

360
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:27,045
對某些生物來說，這意味著僅6個月的生命週期
For some species, this means a lifespan of just 6 months.

361
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:30,048
對其它的，可能長達5年
For others, up to 5 years.

362
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:38,640
魷魚是章魚的表親
Cousin of the octopus is the squid,

363
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:43,020
它們謹慎地將卵產在海藻叢中
seen here delicately laying eggs in forest fronds.

364
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,399
我們經常把魷魚稱作槍烏賊
We know squid more commonly as calamari,

365
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:50,777
儘管魷魚是全世界的美食
but despite being a favored delicacy around the world,

366
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,864
很多品種的數量仍在上升
many species are increasing in number.

367
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,657
像其他頭足綱動物一樣
Like other cephalopods,

368
00:33:55,825 --> 00:34:00,203
它們充分利用海洋掠食者大量消失的機會
they're making the most of oceans depleted of natural predators

369
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:04,166
而且似乎比別的生物更能適應海水的變化
and seem more resilient than others to changing water conditions.

370
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:11,798
這個家族的另一個魅力成員是烏賊
Another charismatic member of the family is the cuttlefish.

371
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:14,968
它們如同具有魔力一般
These creatures have magical attributes.

372
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:19,347
外部，大眼睛令人印象深刻
On the outside, large eyes as expressive as our own.

373
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:23,351
內部，三顆心臟推動藍色的血液
On the inside, three hearts that pump blue blood.

374
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,857
在繁殖季，它們三五成群
During their breeding season, they gather in small groups,

375
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:32,444
小型宇宙飛船般一個接一個急速前進
zooming amongst one another like miniature spaceships.

376
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,613
利用噴水的推進力
Masters of jet propulsion,

377
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:38,784
它們能向前，後及兩邊隨意移動
they can move backwards, forwards or sideways with equal ease.

378
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:43,330
它們每年都會回到繁殖地
Every year they return to favorite nesting sites,

379
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:46,083
比如這個有毒火珊瑚
like this colony of venomous fire coral.

380
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:54,424
雄性用引人注目的表演和姿勢
Males use dramatic body displays and postures

381
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,718
來競爭交配權
to compete for mating rights.

382
00:34:56,886 --> 00:35:00,639
雖然競爭激烈，但幾乎不用搏鬥
So although competition is intense, it's rarely physical.

383
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,561
雌烏賊從嘴裡取出一團卵
Clutching her brood of eggs in her mouth,

384
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:10,941
然後把孩子交由珊瑚來照料
a female surrenders her young to the care of coral.

385
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:35,507
火焰烏賊是名副其實的
The flamboyant cuttlefish is one of the tiniest cephalopods,

386
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:38,051
最小的頭足綱動物之一
yet lives up to its name.

387
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:42,848
因骨板太小不能漂浮，所以它更多的是行走而不是游泳
Its cuttlebone is too small to float, so it walks more than swims.

388
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:47,644
它用閃爍的皮膚斑紋宣告自己毒性很強
And it has a highly poisonous flesh, advertised by its pulsing skin.

389
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,524
它也是致命的掠食者
It's also a deadly predator.

390
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:56,778
縮在外套膜裡的的兩條專用觸鬚
Two specialized tentacles are contained within a muscular sleeve,

391
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,905
可以像矛一樣迅速發射
which is launched like a spear.

392
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:14,004
擁有這種捕獵技巧，難怪頭足綱動物
With this kind of hunting prowess, it's no wonder

393
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:17,340
成功地譜寫了在珊瑚礁的生存故事
the cephalopods have been such a success story on the reef

394
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:22,262
無疑它們也將會在未來統治海底很多年
and will no doubt rule the seabed for eons to come.

395
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:45,410
珊瑚礁不僅對常住居民很重要
Reefs are not only important to their permanent residents,

396
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:48,580
對很多訪客來說也很重要
but also to many oceanic visitors.

397
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:53,293
常有強烈的洋流以和上升流帶來的豐富食物
Strong currents and rich upwellings of food often occur around reefs

398
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,671
出現在珊瑚礁周圍，這吸引了魟魚等流浪者
and attract nomads such as rays.

399
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:10,977
事實上，依賴珊瑚礁生存的海洋生物
In fact, the total number of marine creatures dependent on coral reefs

400
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:13,104
不計其數
is immeasurable.

401
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:20,362
可能有700萬個物種在生活在這裡
Perhaps as many as seven million species coexist here.

402
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:45,262
超過4000種熱帶魚與珊瑚礁有關
Over 4,000 species of tropical fish are associated with coral reefs,

403
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:50,308
其中75%依靠珊瑚礁生存
of which 75% depend on the reef for their survival.

404
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:05,532
也許它們看起來像是彩色紙片
They may look like just colorful confetti,

405
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,868
但每種魚都有自己的個性
but each fish is its own individual.

406
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:14,958
魚類有嗅覺，聽覺，視覺和觸覺
Fish can smell, hear, see and touch.

407
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:18,712
它們能感受到疼痛並且有複雜的關係
They feel pain and have complex relationships.

408
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:24,759
絕大多數的珊瑚礁魚類都會界定領地
The vast majority of reef fish have defined home ranges.

409
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:32,100
珊瑚礁供養，收容它們，使它們遠離掠食者
The reef sustains them, houses them and conceals them from predators.

410
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,778
就像被隱形的線拴著的小風箏
Like tiny kites on invisible strings,

411
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:46,990
魚兒在心愛的珊瑚礁周圍徘徊
the fish hover above their beloved reefs,

412
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,285
只在覓食時冒險出去一下
venturing only far enough to snatch a meal,

413
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:53,163
除此之外與珊瑚形影不離
but otherwise inseparable.

414
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,943
魚類和珊瑚之間的關係
The connection between fish and coral

415
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:27,947
是大自然的最持久的愛情故事之一
is one of nature's most enduring love stories.

416
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:35,288
人類從珊瑚和海洋的
Humans too benefit from a healthy relationship with coral

417
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,457
健康關係中獲益良多
and the seas at large.

418
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:44,422
珊瑚礁在海中創造障礙物保護海岸線
Reefs create barriers to the sea and protect shorelines.

419
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:52,514
許多藥物是從珊瑚礁中提煉出的
Various life-saving medicines are extracted from reefs.

420
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:56,976
海洋的衍生化學品被用來治療許多疾病
Ocean-derived chemicals are used to treat many illnesses,

421
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,937
包括癌癥
including cancer.

422
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:07,862
微小的海藻處理大氣中的二氧化碳
Microscopic marine algae processes our atmospheric CO2

423
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:12,325
並產生70%的氧氣
and produces 70% of the oxygen we breathe.

424
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:19,999
因此，像這些魚一樣，我們的生存需要健康的海洋
So, like these fish, we need healthy oceans to survive

425
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:23,253
還需要健康的珊瑚礁保護家園
and reefs to secure our homes.

426
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:02,542
不論在陸地上還是海底
In both our terrestrial world and the undersea,

427
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:07,130
創造與毀滅總是在不斷地循環
there have been constant cycles of creation and destruction.

428
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:10,467
大自然的規則就是混亂
The rule of nature is chaos.

429
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,677
儘管珊瑚礁看上去很和諧
Although a reef looks harmonious,

430
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:16,014
它和其它生態系統一樣混亂
it's as chaotic as any other ecosystem.

431
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,725
其中一種在混亂中生存的方法就是
And one of the ways to survive chaos,

432
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:21,311
不論你在海面上還是海面下
whether you're above or below the surface,

433
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,396
都要和別人合作
is to cooperate.

434
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:27,400
這種合作叫做共生
This cooperation is called symbiosis,

435
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,903
是一種存在於兩種
a mutually beneficial relationship

436
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,947
不同物種間的互惠關係
between two entirely different species.

437
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:40,914
如果不能把自己變得有用的話
These little blue and black striped wrasse would be perfect fish food

438
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:43,833
這種藍黑相間的小瀨魚將是完美的魚食
if they hadn't made themselves so useful.

439
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:48,755
它們是靠清潔工作賺取來贏得生存的裂唇魚
They're cleaner wrasse and earn their keep by cleaning.

440
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,132
這項服務如此重要
So vital is this service

441
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:55,303
以致於感激的主人從不敢吃掉它們
that none of their grateful hosts would ever dare to eat them.

442
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:04,395
當雙方都獲利時，平衡關係隨即建立
Both parties benefit and a form of balance is achieved.

443
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,778
珊瑚礁中有種穩定的張力
There is constant tension on the reef

444
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:14,447
因為不同的物種在平衡中活動
as different species work out this balance

445
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:18,743
並努力延長它們在歷史中逗留的時間
and try to maximize their moment in history.

446
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,958
對某些大魚來說
For some of the bigger fish,

447
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:28,836
那段時間常被延伸到數十年
that moment used to stretch into decades.

448
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:31,673
有些甚至有一個世紀或更多
Some even lived for a century or more.

449
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,844
但是高齡者日益少見
But old age is a rarity now

450
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:41,099
標誌性的珊瑚礁物種就在我們眼前消失
and iconic reef species are vanishing even as we watch.

451
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:57,198
野生神僊魚的壽命有10到15年
Angelfish live for 10 to 15 years in the wild

452
00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:01,411
是珊瑚礁中最可辨的生物之一
and are some of the reef's most recognizable species.

453
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,538
它們被收藏者視若珍寶
They are highly prized by collectors

454
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:08,751
但不幸的是，很多只能在水族館度過漫長的一生
and, tragically, many live out their long lives in aquaria.

455
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:12,714
池中的魚就像籠中的鳥
A fish in a tank is like a bird in a cage -

456
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:17,093
我們可以觀察它們，卻對其野生狀況知之甚少
we're able to observe them but we get little idea of their wildness.

457
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,721
只有在這裡，珊瑚礁中
It's only here, on the reef,

458
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:25,059
我們才能真正體會魚類的生活有多麼複雜
that we can truly appreciate just how complex a fish's life can be.

459
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,903
有的神僊魚沒有固定伴侶
Some angelfish are promiscuous,

460
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:37,822
有的因生活所需結合在一起
some bond for life,

461
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,658
有的則是一夫多妻
others have male-driven harems.

462
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:45,413
許多魚類，包括這種纖美的三棘高身鲉
And many fish, including these delicate leafed scorpionfish,

463
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:48,499
忙於進行長時間的求偶儀式
engage in long courtship rituals.

464
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:54,047
每週都會發現新的魚類
New species of fish are discovered every week,

465
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:58,384
每一個發現都成為新信息的財富
and with each discovery comes a wealth of new information.

466
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:02,055
有的每天產卵
Some spawn daily,

467
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:06,643
其它的直到20或30歲才開始繁殖
others do not begin breeding until they are 20 or 30 years old.

468
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:11,898
許多生命開始時是雄性，結束時卻是雌性
Many start life as a male but die a female.

469
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,735
大多數具有高度社會性
Most are highly social

470
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:19,072
其智力超過我們的理解
and have intelligence beyond our comprehension.

472
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:30,875
像在非洲平原上的牛羚和斑馬
Like wildebeest and zebra on the African plains,

473
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:34,879
刺尾魚和鸚嘴魚一起吃草
tangs and parrotfish often graze together.

474
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,756
它們都是食草動物
Both fish are herbivores

475
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:40,301
以藻類甚至活珊瑚為食
and dine on algae and even live coral.

476
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,430
其它種類則聚集在珊瑚礁頂部
Other species converge on the reef crest.

477
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:48,893
這裡暴露在波浪和陽光下
This area is exposed to wave action and lots of sunlight

478
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:51,145
有豐富的營養
and is rich in nutrients.

479
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:53,356
花尾連鰭魚會搬動石塊
Fish like this rock-mover wrasse

480
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:57,276
來尋找蠕蟲和軟體動物
literally move rocks in the search of worms and mollusks.

481
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:59,862
這樣的覓食很辛苦
Dining this way is hard work,

482
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,699
所以它們並不總是願意分享覓食地
and they're not always willing to share their patch.

483
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:10,790
其它魚類挖掘基底併吞下一大口沙子
Others excavate the substrate and swallow large mouthfuls of sand.

484
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:14,836
它們的身體是為過濾沙中的海藻
Their bodies are specially designed to filter the sand for algae,

485
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:17,755
並通過腮排除廢物而專門設計的
dispelling waste through their gills.

486
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:25,471
不是什麼時候都能去珊瑚礁頂部
Access to the reef crest is limited.

487
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:28,891
只有漲潮並風平浪靜時
It's only at certain tides and during calm seas

488
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:31,352
才可能在那裡覓食
that it's possible to feed here.

489
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,190
萬事俱備
When all the conditions are right,

490
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:41,446
魚兒從幾英里外游來抓住這個難得的機會
fish arrive from miles around to take advantage of this rare opportunity.

491
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:46,033
有的成雙成對，有的獨來獨往
Some are in couples, others dine alone,

492
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:50,037
完全不同的生物一起覓食
and completely different species feed side by side.

493
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:54,000
這是生物多樣性的最佳狀態
It's biodiversity at its best.

494
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:17,523
古怪的泥土搬運工，比如鲀魚
Eccentric earth-movers, like triggerfish,

495
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,442
也加入到晚宴中
also join the dinner party.

496
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:23,780
它們會用強有力的喙
They use their powerful beaks to cast aside whole chunks of coral,

497
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,615
拋開整塊珊瑚
as they search for clams,

498
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,867
尋找蛤蜊，蝦和蟹
shrimp and crabs.

499
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:33,080
它們已經無暇顧及餐桌禮儀了
They're much too busy to worry about their table manners.

500
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:48,596
像人類的城市
Like a human city,

501
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:51,390
珊瑚礁作為調和混亂的角色
a reef boasts an eclectic jumble of characters

502
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:54,685
不同生物各有自己的生活選擇
conducting themselves in a variety of ways.

503
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:01,317
有獨行俠，流浪者
There are loners and drifters.

504
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,951
有的進行秘密集會
There are clandestine meetings

505
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:12,453
地下活動
and underground movements.

506
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,833
有的小心機警
There are the watchful and the wary.

507
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,547
各種方式的自我表現
And different forms of self-expression.

508
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:46,320
就像在城市中一樣，有奇怪的聯盟出現
As in all of our cities, strange alliances occur...

509
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,871
古怪的時尚也可容忍
..and odd fashion is tolerated.

510
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:03,004
無論美醜都有一席之地
Every beauty and beast has its place.

511
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:23,399
珊瑚礁和陸地一樣，24小時為一週期
Just like the terrestrial world, a reef has a 24-hour cycle.

512
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,237
當下午的陽光開始黯淡
As the afternoon light begins to fade,

513
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:31,657
這些軟魚產卵後便馬上離開
fish, like these anthias, spawn with abandon,

514
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,868
它們知道夜晚即將到來
knowing that night will soon follow

515
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:35,995
並利用夜色保護魚卵
and conceal their eggs.

516
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:40,708
這時，小魚抖動身體
Meanwhile, tiny fish shudder their bodies,

517
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:43,044
表明它們做好了交配的準備
indicating their readiness to mate.

518
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:49,759
無數的晝行魚被蒼茫的暮色刺激
And countless other daytime fish are inspired by the waning light

519
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,969
開始獻慇勤或繁殖
to court or breed.

520
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:06,859
一對管口魚跳著誘人的劍舞
Here, a pair of flutemouths engage in a seductive sword dance.

521
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:09,111
這是管口魚式的「前戲」
It's their form of foreplay,

522
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:11,489
並且已經持續了好幾小時
and they've been at it for hours.

523
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:20,456
幾千年來，獵人與獵物間的戰爭
Over the millennia, the battle between predator and prey

524
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:24,293
為海底生物的「軍備競賽」推波助瀾
has fueled an evolutionary arms race under the sea.

525
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:28,506
大自然總是將她的設計升級
Mother Nature is always updating her designs

526
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,800
並淘汰過時的那個
and making old ones redundant.

527
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,678
動物們必須不斷提高
Animals have had to constantly refine

528
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:37,264
它們的進攻和防禦能力
their offensive and defensive capabilities.

529
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:41,018
結果可能像科幻小說
The result can be pure science fiction.

530
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:54,073
安康魚和蝎子魚的模樣非常怪異
Angler and scorpion fish are as bizarre as they come.

531
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:56,534
它們是海綿的專業模仿者
They're expert mimics of sponges,

532
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:59,286
但有世界上最快速的一擊
but have one of the fastest strikes on Earth.

533
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:07,169
不過它們肯定贏不了選美比賽
But they're certainly not out to win a beauty prize.

534
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:11,632
當它碰到同類時，愛是盲目的
When it comes to some of these creations, love is certainly blind.

535
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:29,483
從人類歷史開始時，我們就對這無數生命著迷不已
This myriad life has enthralled us since the beginning of human history.

536
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:32,278
我們起源於海洋
We did originally evolve from the sea.

537
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:35,322
自從早期人類首次出現
And ever since early humans first emerged,

538
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:38,701
我們就被拉回到海岸邊
we've been drawn back to its shores.

539
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,245
海鮮是受人青睞的食物
Seafood has been a favored diet.

540
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:44,331
貝殼成為貨幣和寶石
Shells have been our money and jewelry.

541
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:50,671
珊瑚石灰岩鋪平道路
Coral limestone paves our roads.

542
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:52,923
沙子築成房屋
Sand cements our houses.

543
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:56,010
我們的神話和傳說，書籍與影片
Our myths and legends, books and films

544
00:50:56,178 --> 00:51:00,097
充滿了源自海洋的角色
are all full of characters derived from the sea.

545
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:09,899
當光線黯淡，主角開始變換
And as light fades, these characters begin to change

546
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:14,612
珊瑚礁的故事變得大為不同
and the story of coral moves into a very different narrative.

547
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:24,997
大型掠食性魚類巡遊在珊瑚礁邊緣，尋找致命一擊
Big predatory fish cruise the reef's edge, searching for a final kill.

548
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,633
晝行魚匆忙躲藏
Daytime fish hurry into hiding.

549
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:39,804
這是個危險的過渡時間
This is a dangerous time of transition.

550
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:43,766
整個珊瑚礁裡開始換崗
All across the reef, there is a changing of the guard.

551
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,780
夜班開始了
The night shift has begun.

552
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,961
人類對海洋知之甚少
Little is known about our oceans.

553
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:14,797
火星地表都被更精確地繪製過
The surface of Mars is better mapped.

554
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:25,599
大多數活珊瑚在水下淺於50米的地方
Most living coral reefs descend to only 50 meters or so,

555
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:28,269
那是由於對陽光的依賴
due to the reliance on sunlight.

556
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:35,109
但有些地方海床下降到11000米
But the seafloor falls to 11 kilometers in places.

557
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:38,404
這就是我們所說的「深淵」
This is what we call the abyss.

558
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:44,118
夜幕下的珊瑚礁使我們感覺到
Night-time on the reef gives us a sense

559
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:46,704
深淵中可能的樣子
of what this abyss might be like.

560
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:54,837
漆黑的一片富有活力，滿是奇異生物
The inky black is very much alive and full of aliens.

561
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:05,181
在長有深海珊瑚的特殊地點
In special places where reefs drop to great depth,

562
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:07,725
深海浮游生物上升到水面
deep sea plankton rise to the surface

563
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:10,895
捕食淺水浮游植物
to hunt shallow water phytoplankton.

564
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:14,231
它們游經數百米
They travel hundreds of meters.

565
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:16,400
數以億計
They number in their billions

566
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:19,695
每晚重複旅程
and they repeat the journey every night.

567
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:23,741
這是動物王國裡最壯觀的遷徙之一
It's one of the biggest migrations in the animal kingdom.

568
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:33,042
浮游生物獵人和獵物間的追逐
The chase of plankton-hunter and plankton-prey

569
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:37,963
引發了晚間珊瑚礁中更大的反應鏈
triggers a larger chain reaction right across the night-time reef.

570
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:44,011
籃海星從巢穴中出來
Baitfish snatch mouthfuls,

571
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,972
伸出網狀觸角
while basking stars emerge from their lairs

572
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,808
餌魚藉機大口搶食
and extend web-like arms.

573
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:58,442
當浮游生物瘋狂地相互溝通時
The water flashes with color

574
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:01,987
海水閃爍著五彩顏色
as the plankton frantically communicate with one another.

575
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,203
珊瑚並不是無所事事的旁觀者
Coral is not an idle bystander.

576
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:12,581
珊瑚礁已成為一堵滿是嘴巴的牆
The reef has become a wall of mouths.

577
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:16,835
珊瑚真正的動物本性顯示出來
The true animal nature of coral is revealed.

578
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:24,760
配備有毒刺和酸液的珊瑚蟲
Equipped with poisonous harpoons and acid,

579
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:30,349
每一隻都是一個無法逃脫的致命陷阱
each polyp becomes a deadly trap from which escape is impossible.

580
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:38,315
鯰魚在行進中進食
Meanwhile, catfish eat on the run.

581
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:42,861
鸚嘴魚睡覺時把眼睛睜得大大的
Parrotfish sleep with eyes wide open

582
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:46,532
或是隱藏在薄粘液膜中
or conceal themselves in mucus cocoons.

583
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:54,039
沒有手電筒的話，人類無法在夜間視物
Without torches, humans are blind at night.

584
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:57,501
在水下，我們幾乎不能辨別方位
Underwater, we'd barely know up from down.

585
00:54:57,669 --> 00:55:01,797
但水下獵手卻沒有一點不便
But the undersea hunters are not at all disadvantaged.

586
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:07,511
它們用震動，電子脈衝和化學物質
Instead of sight, they use vibration, electrical impulses

587
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:10,973
代替視覺，來追蹤獵物
and chemical traces to find what they're after.

588
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:29,158
石頭牆，其實是石頭魚在等待伏擊
Stone walls are, in fact, living stonefish waiting in ambush...

589
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:37,082
長有利齒的鰧魚潛伏在淤泥中
..while the sharp teeth of stargazers lurk beneath the muck.

590
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:50,971
獵物很容易在不知情時游向危險
It's easy to swim towards danger without realizing it.

591
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:54,308
這只海葵已成為連環殺手
This anemone has become a serial killer.

592
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:02,524
一隻幸運的烏賊逃走了，並釋放墨水掩蓋其蹤跡
A lucky squid escapes, releasing ink to cover its tracks.

593
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,443
海龍看著魚兒四散
A pipefish looks on,

594
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:07,988
並有更多淪為受害者
as fish scatter and more fall victim.

595
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:18,040
下降到海床上
Down on the seabed,

596
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,584
食腐動物收集殘羹剩飯
scavengers collect the scraps...

597
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:29,009
獅子魚用長刺捕捉毫無戒心的獵物
..while lionfish use their long spines to herd unsuspecting prey.

598
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:42,356
所有地方都有生命活動
There is activity in all directions,

599
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:46,735
形形色色的夜間獵人吃飽了
as night hunters of every description eat their fill.

600
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:56,286
躄魚回來了，適得其所
The anglerfish is back and now completely in its element.

601
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:58,122
也許它的動作算不上優雅
It may not move with grace,

602
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:01,250
但那對捕食沒什麼影響
but that doesn't affect its chances for a kill.

603
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:06,839
它所需要的只是等待食物游進自己的嘴裡
All it needs to do is wait for a meal to come to its mouth.

604
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:11,802
說到夜間狩獵
When it comes to nocturnal hunting,

605
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:14,847
海鱔因其邪惡外表而聞名
moray eels are known for their viciousness.

606
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:17,850
但其它獵手就不那麼容易認出了
But other killers are not so easy to spot.

607
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:22,312
蝦蛄老練又野蠻
Mantis shrimp are sophisticated and savage.

608
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,440
它們擁有極佳視力
They're armed with supreme eyesight

609
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,692
積極捕食獵物
and actively hunt live prey

610
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:29,445
其它甲殼動物，比如龍蝦
while other crustaceans, like lobsters,

611
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:32,322
則在海底尋找剩菜
scour the sea floor for leftovers.

612
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,166
由於之前的繁忙時光
With a busy time ahead,

613
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:45,502
儘管周圍有這麼多的活動，晝行魚仍試著睡覺
day fish try to sleep despite all the activity.

614
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:51,633
有些好像飄在黑暗中的幽靈
Some drifting like ghosts in the dark.

615
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:05,272
小丑魚也試著睡覺，但並不容易
The anemone fish are also trying to sleep, but aren't finding it easy.

616
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:13,614
它們的扁平夥伴，斑點蟹，正在享受宵夜
Their flat-mates, the dotted crabs, are enjoying a midnight snack.

617
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:22,915
最活躍的夜間徘徊者是貝殼
Some of the most active night prowlers are shells.

618
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:28,128
大多數人只能從貝殼店或沙灘上的死貝殼瞭解它們
Many of us only know them from shell shops or dead on the beach.

619
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:31,798
但活貝殼更珍貴
But shells alive are much more precious -

620
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:37,763
它們好像吉普賽大篷車，在不斷地移動中被海水擦亮
gypsy caravans, varnished by the oceans, constantly on the move.

621
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,938
黑暗也適合求愛的花斑連鰭銜魚
Darkness also suits courting mandarin fish.

622
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,858
它們有很強的性衝動
They have an unusually high sex drive

623
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:53,237
如果需要的話，它們每晚都可以產卵
and can spawn every night if the urge takes them.

624
00:58:57,116 --> 00:58:59,747
儘管水下的燈光可讓我們匆忙一瞥
Although our underwater lights give us a glimpse,

625
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:03,914
我們仍然對珊瑚礁的夜間活動知之甚少
we still know very little about what happens on a reef at night.

626
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:08,252
而我們那種無理由的恐懼使之更加難以被瞭解
And our unwarranted fears have made it harder to learn.

627
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:13,465
我們對海洋的態度一直充滿矛盾
Our attitude to the sea has been full of contradiction.

628
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:16,009
一方面我們尊敬它
On the one hand we've revered it,

629
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:19,179
另一方面我們將它視為敵人
on the other we've seen it as an enemy -

630
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:24,101
黑暗，深不可測，滿是怪獸
dark and unfathomable, full of dragons and monsters.

631
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:29,022
深海怪獸早就
These monsters of the deep

632
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:33,527
被證實是我們虛構的
have long been proven figments of our collective imagination.

633
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:38,574
但有些人相信它們仍然以鯊魚的形式存在
But some believe they still exist in the form of sharks.

634
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:40,659
真是天大的錯誤
How wrong they are.

635
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:45,414
這些神奇的生物比恐龍出現得還早
These magnificent creatures predate dinosaurs.

636
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:49,376
和珊瑚一樣，它們在幾次大滅絕中倖存
Like coral, they've survived several mass extinctions

637
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:54,256
並在塑造海洋進化的過程中扮演了同等重要的角色
and have played an equally vital role in shaping ocean evolution.

638
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:05,851
鯊魚已在海洋中漫遊了超過4億年
Sharks have been roaming our seas for over 400 million years.

639
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:10,897
化石記錄顯示千萬個物種出現並消亡
Fossil records show that thousands of species have come and gone,

640
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:15,527
但其中370種還和我們在一起
of which 370 are with us today.

641
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:17,821
它們在世界各地都能找到
They can be found worldwide,

642
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:23,035
有許多依賴於珊瑚礁生態系統，以獲得保護和食物
with many dependent on coral reef ecosystems for protection and food.

643
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:38,842
作為頂級掠食者
As top predators,

644
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:42,262
鯊魚影響了整個食物鏈的
sharks have influenced adaptation and evolution

645
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:44,890
適應性和進化
all the way down the food chain.

646
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,811
但是，與傳統認識相反
But, contrary to popular myth,

647
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:53,815
鯊魚不僅僅是依靠本能的捕食機器
sharks are not just instinctive eating machines.

648
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:59,655
許多種鯊魚展示了強大的解決問題的能力
Many species exhibit powerful problem-solving skills

649
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:03,909
它們的腦和體重比與其它更高級的脊椎動物
and their brain-to-body-mass ratio is similar to many mammals

650
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:06,078
及許多哺乳動物相似
and other higher order vertebrates.

651
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:11,208
所以它們聰明，好奇，好交際
So they are as intelligent, curious and social

652
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:14,378
和某些我們更喜歡的動物一樣
as some of our more favored animals.

653
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:19,925
它們不僅擁有我們具有的5種感覺
They not only possess the 5 senses we do -

654
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:22,928
視覺，聽覺，觸覺，嗅覺，味覺
sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste -

655
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:26,098
還能感知電流
but can also perceive electrical currents

656
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:28,225
和磁場
and magnetic fields.

657
01:01:34,899 --> 01:01:36,233
如果我們和它們在水下
If we're in the water with them,

658
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:40,112
它們在幾英里外就能感知到我們的存在
they can detect our presence from miles away.

659
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:43,490
它們能監測到我們的心跳
They can monitor the beating of our heart...

660
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:46,326
還能讀懂我們的情緒
..and read our mood.

661
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:11,309
涉及到人類時，它們通常是謹慎的生物
When it comes to humans, they are normally cautious creatures.

662
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:13,937
只要有可能，它們會避開我們
Whenever possible, they avoid us.

663
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:15,605
原因很明顯
With good reason.

664
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:21,528
每年超過1億條鯊魚被殺
Every year, over 100 million sharks are killed,

665
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:25,031
這主要是為了它們的鰭
the majority just for their fins.

666
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:28,827
魚翅是亞洲湯的傳統配菜
Their fins are a traditional ingredient in Asian soup

667
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:31,538
其價值相當於魚子醬
and their value rivals caviar.

668
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:43,258
鯊魚被割去魚鰭時還活著
The sharks are often finned alive

669
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:46,470
被扔回海裡後才溺死
and thrown back into the water to drown.

670
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:59,274
由於過度捕撈
One third of all open-ocean shark species are now facing extinction,

671
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:02,360
所有公海鯊魚中，有1/3的種類已瀕臨滅絕
primarily due to over-fishing.

672
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:10,660
如果說海洋裡有殺戮機器的話，不是它們
So if there is a killing machine in our seas, it's not them,

673
01:03:10,828 --> 01:03:12,537
而是我們
it's us.

674
01:03:24,425 --> 01:03:26,259
所以鯊魚都受到威脅
No shark is safe,

675
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:29,137
即使是最大的鯊魚，鯨鯊
not even the biggest of them all, the whale shark.

676
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:36,269
長達15米，重達12噸，它們令人印象深刻
Up to 15 meters long and 12 tons in weight, they're an impressive sight.

677
01:03:36,437 --> 01:03:40,774
它們是嚴格的濾食性動物，主要以浮游生物為食
But they're strictly filter feeders and dine mostly on plankton.

678
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:48,031
令人難以置信的是，它們也是非法捕魚的受害者
Unbelievably, they are also victims of illegal fishing.

679
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:57,999
鯨鯊不是鯨而是鯊魚
Whale sharks are not actually whales but sharks.

680
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:03,672
小須鯨才是遊歷在珊瑚礁中的真正的鯨魚
True whales that visit the reefs include these, the minke.

681
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:15,058
但這些優雅的動物竟然也被人類捕殺
Incredibly, these graceful animals are still being harpooned.

682
01:04:17,144 --> 01:04:20,355
無論如何，它們是那樣信任我們
What trust they show us, regardless.

683
01:04:31,909 --> 01:04:36,788
在我們開始掠奪海洋之前，它們是這個樣子
Before we began to plunder the seas, this is what they were like.

684
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:43,336
連接著深淵與海面
Linking the abyss with the surface,

685
01:04:43,504 --> 01:04:47,382
層層疊疊，銀光閃閃
layer upon layer of shimmering silver.

686
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:17,537
大型魚群是健康海洋的標誌形象
A big school of fish is a defining image of a healthy sea.

687
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:23,543
這是力量和驚人適應性的展示
It's a show of strength and incredible physiological adaptation.

688
01:05:26,547 --> 01:05:28,256
大多數魚從頭部到尾部
Running head to tail in most fish

689
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:31,593
有一排魚鱗叫做側線
is a row of scales known as the lateral line.

690
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:34,012
這條連接到腦神經的線
Connected to nerves in the brain,

691
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:36,765
包含有特殊的細胞
this line consists of specialized cells

692
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:40,685
對水的位移及運動很敏感
that are sensitive to water displacement and movement.

693
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:45,649
同時，魚眼長在頭部兩側
Meanwhile, fishes' eyes are located on the sides of their heads

694
01:05:45,816 --> 01:05:49,903
使它容易看清自己同其它魚的位置關係
to make it easy to see where they are in relation to one another.

695
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:56,493
所以，視力有助於保持魚兒之間的角度和距離
So, vision helps maintain angle and distance between fish,

696
01:05:56,661 --> 01:06:02,123
側線則決定了整個魚群的速度和方向
while the lateral line dictates speed and direction of the entire school.

697
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:09,089
這樣，許多魚可以作為整體來行動
In this way, many fish can move as one

698
01:06:09,256 --> 01:06:13,468
跳著它們自創的水下芭蕾
and choreograph their own aquatic ballet.

699
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:40,578
許多魚群是由幼魚組成
Many fish school as juveniles

700
01:06:40,746 --> 01:06:43,957
有約一半以上種類的魚都會在
and around half of all fish species form aggregations

701
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:46,668
生命中的某段時間聚集成群
at some point in their lifecycle.

702
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:52,048
就算是喜歡獨行的魚也會時不時的加入魚群
Even fish that prefer their solitude join a school from time to time.

703
01:06:56,804 --> 01:06:59,139
梭魚在晚上獨自獵食
Barracuda hunt on their own at night

704
01:06:59,306 --> 01:07:03,393
但白天成群結伴以獲得保護
but hang out in packs during the day for protection and company.

705
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:13,820
它們有尖尖的頭和流線型的身體
With their pointed heads and streamlined bodies -

706
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:15,530
可以長到2米長
up to 2 meters long -

707
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:19,951
它們像箭一樣一起穿越大海
they fly in unison through the blue like polished arrows.

708
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:30,045
群聚使得掠食者很難專注於一個目標
Schooling makes it hard for a predator to focus on one target

709
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:33,089
這是很好的防禦機制
and is a great defense mechanism.

710
01:07:34,759 --> 01:07:38,636
進食時，這也是一股不容忽視的力量
It's also a force to be reckoned with when it comes to feeding.

711
01:07:57,031 --> 01:08:00,742
少有浮游生物能逃脫張開的嘴的掃蕩
Few plankton in the area will escape this sweep of open mouths,

712
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:05,663
比如這些罕見的濾食性鯖魚施展的協同攻擊
as these rare filter-feeding mackerel make their coordinated attack.

713
01:08:13,297 --> 01:08:17,592
億萬年來，群聚行為曾在許多方面幫助魚類
Over the eons, the art of schooling has helped fish in many ways.

714
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:22,013
但是現在，諷刺的是，它導致了魚類的沒落
But now, ironically, it contributes to their downfall.

715
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:27,852
下一次網就能捕捉到一噸魚
Just one net can collect a ton of fish at once.

716
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:32,732
每年超過1億噸海魚被捕撈
And over 100 million tons of fish are hauled from the oceans each year.

717
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:38,071
大魚群所剩無幾
For the few big schools left,

718
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:44,077
穿過空曠的大海時，它們肯定感覺很怪異
it must feel quite eerie moving through so much empty liquid blue.

719
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:58,049
今天，對魚群來說安全的地方
These days, one of the only safe places for schooling fish

720
01:08:58,217 --> 01:09:00,176
只剩海洋保護區了
is a marine sanctuary.

721
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:10,353
自從建立保護區以來
Whenever sanctuaries have been established and policed,

722
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:12,856
魚類數量緩慢增長
fish stocks have slowly increased,

723
01:09:13,023 --> 01:09:16,025
這有助於恢復生物多樣性
helping to restore biodiversity.

724
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:24,325
成功的保護區成為寶貴的時光膠囊
A successful sanctuary becomes a precious time capsule...

725
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:28,788
提醒我們海洋曾經是多麼富饒
..a reminder of how rich the seas once were.

726
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:30,957
而且能再次變得富饒
And could be again.

727
01:09:35,546 --> 01:09:39,257
和動物園不一樣，海洋保護區沒有圍牆
Unlike a zoo, a marine sanctuary has no walls.

728
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:43,136
所以它不僅有能力恢復鄰近區域
So it has the capacity to not only replenish the immediate area,

729
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:45,680
還能恢復周圍的海域
but the oceans around it.

730
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:02,864
我們給自己的海域起了不同的名字
Because we have individual names for our oceans

731
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,741
還有領土邊界
and have territorial borders,

732
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:08,036
但我們忘記了只有一個生態系統
we forget that there's only one system.

733
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:11,247
只有一個海洋
There is only one sea.

734
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:20,340
海水，覆蓋地球表面的70%，連接著所有生靈
Water, covering 70% of our planet's surface, connects us all.

735
01:10:23,928 --> 01:10:28,640
即使在極地發生的事也會影響到珊瑚
What occurs even in our polar regions will eventually affect coral.

736
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:34,312
相反，每一個新的海洋保護區都是
And, conversely, each new marine sanctuary is another powerful step

737
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,398
拯救海洋的有力步伐
towards saving our seas.

738
01:10:41,987 --> 01:10:43,404
當你意識到
And when you consider

739
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:48,952
海洋構成了地球上99%的生物圈
that the global ocean makes up 99% of the living biosphere of the planet,

740
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:51,996
那麼每一步都很有意義
every step counts.

741
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:02,048
由於對許多海洋生物來說
Because reefs are such important breeding grounds

742
01:11:02,216 --> 01:11:04,342
珊瑚礁是非常重要的繁殖地
for so many marine creatures,

743
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:07,262
這可能是全新未來的起點
this is where a new future might lie.

744
01:11:08,472 --> 01:11:10,848
復甦是個日常事務
Renewal here is a daily affair

745
01:11:11,016 --> 01:11:14,602
並帶來神奇的轉變
and brings with it magical transformation.

746
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:21,442
這裡，石斑魚求愛時，身體顏色變紅
Here, a coral cod blushes a different color when wooed by its mate.

747
01:11:28,033 --> 01:11:31,619
蓬勃的珊瑚礁就像水中的彩虹
A thriving reef is an aquatic rainbow.

748
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:34,163
就像石斑魚的皮膚
And like the skin of the coral cod,

749
01:11:34,331 --> 01:11:37,500
這些顏色自有其意義與功能
these colors have meaning and function.

750
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:40,795
銀色的鱗片反射光線
Silver scales reflect light

751
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:44,382
使魚兒和水中背景融為一體
and allow fish to blend into their watery backgrounds.

752
01:11:52,766 --> 01:11:56,269
大膽，強烈的顏色使魚兒在魚群中
Bold, strong colors allow fish to recognize their own species

753
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:57,937
辨認出自己的同類
in a crowd.

754
01:11:58,939 --> 01:12:03,651
顏色也可表明它是幼年還是成年
Color also indicates whether a fish is a juvenile or adult,

755
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:07,488
有些魚在性成熟時，顏色變化非常明顯
and some fish change color quite radically as they mature.

756
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:11,117
一旦魚兒成為配偶
Once fish are paired up,

757
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:13,786
它們用身體的姿態和顏色
they can then use body posturing and color displays

758
01:12:13,954 --> 01:12:16,289
來傳達自己的意圖
to communicate their intentions.

759
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:24,380
雄鸚嘴魚豎起背鰭恐嚇其它雄性
A male parrotfish erects his dorsal fin to intimidate other males

760
01:12:24,548 --> 01:12:29,093
給近旁那條模樣完全不同的雌魚留下好印象
and impress a nearby female who happens to look completely different.

761
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:37,852
珊瑚礁裡，魚兒都在尋找交配的機會
And all across the reef, fish are on the lookout for a chance to mate

762
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:41,105
以傳承它們寶貴的基因
and pass on their precious genes.

763
01:12:56,747 --> 01:13:01,542
和人類相比，大多數海洋生物的一生短暫而緊張
Most sea creatures have short, intense lives compared to ours.

764
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:05,671
有些魚只有短短幾年壽命
For some fish, a few years constitutes an entire lifetime.

765
01:13:06,673 --> 01:13:10,218
所以，珊瑚礁中的每一天都很重要
So every good day on a reef is truly great.

766
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:12,720
10年好時光就更棒了
A good decade is even greater,

767
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:15,681
這使無數海洋生物有機會
the chance for countless marine creatures

768
01:13:15,849 --> 01:13:18,267
將它們的生命發揮到淋漓盡致
to live their lives to the fullest

769
01:13:18,435 --> 01:13:21,729
並繁衍後代
and give rise to new generations.

770
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:32,740
要在熱帶海洋中生存
In the quest to survive in these tropical seas,

771
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:35,076
動物們必須極富創造性
animals have had to be highly inventive

772
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:38,579
有時還要打破自然規律
and sometimes nature's own rules are broken.

773
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:41,916
看看海馬
Consider the seahorse.

774
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:47,588
這些擁有各種尺寸的神秘生物
These mystical creatures come in all sizes.

775
01:13:47,756 --> 01:13:52,051
有的比你的手掌還大，有的卻和你的指甲一樣小
Some bigger than your palm, others as small as your fingernail.

776
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:57,223
最小巧的是侏儒海馬
The daintiest of them all is the pygmy seahorse,

777
01:13:57,391 --> 01:14:01,102
它們一輩子都綁在柳珊瑚上
whose life is completely bound to gorgonian coral.

778
01:14:09,027 --> 01:14:13,072
海馬家族有320種
The extended seahorse family consists of 320 species,

779
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:18,077
包括海龍，海馬等
and includes pipefishes, pipehorses and sea dragons.

780
01:14:23,834 --> 01:14:26,419
它們當中的大多數種類
In most species of pipefish and seahorse,

781
01:14:26,587 --> 01:14:29,672
是由雄性養育後代
it's the male that broods the young.

782
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:34,469
這特殊的養育方式不是唯一使它們與眾不同的地方
It's not just this unusual parenting that sets them apart.

783
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:37,597
它們有像馬一樣的腦袋
They have equine heads,

784
01:14:37,764 --> 01:14:39,474
捲曲的尾巴
prehensile tails...

785
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:43,561
有骨板而不是鱗片
..and bony body plates instead of scales.

786
01:14:44,563 --> 01:14:48,733
儘管它們有龍一樣的外表，很多魚喜歡吃它們
Despite their dragon appearance, many fish like to eat them.

787
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:53,613
所以不被發現變成它們的特長
So not being noticed has become their speciality.

788
01:14:56,450 --> 01:15:00,286
剃刀魚擅長偽裝成其它動植物
Ghost pipefish are expert mimics of other animals and plants,

789
01:15:00,454 --> 01:15:02,747
包括海百合和珊瑚
including crinoids and coral.

790
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:05,750
它們的天敵很難發現它們
Their predators find it hard to see them

791
01:15:05,918 --> 01:15:07,710
它們的食物也一樣
and so does their prey.

792
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:11,380
它們一生中大部分時間都是頭朝下
They spend most of their lives upside down,

793
01:15:11,548 --> 01:15:13,841
專注於沙質海底
focused intently on the sandy bottom,

794
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:16,302
尋找小型甲殼動物
searching for the tiny crustaceans

795
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:18,596
這是它們的主要食物
that are their principal food.

796
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:21,057
而海龍的偽裝是如此特別
So specific is their camouflage

797
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:25,186
它們鮮少遠離其特定棲地
that pipefish rarely wander far from a particular habitat

798
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:29,607
同時完善它們的模仿細節
and perfect their mimicry down to the finest detail.

799
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:34,028
其他種類則是通過像漩渦
Other species conceal their true identity

800
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:37,240
和水流般運動來隱蹤匿跡
by moving like eddies and currents.

801
01:15:40,327 --> 01:15:43,955
有的假裝是被沙包裹的木棍
While some pretend to be sand-encrusted sticks

802
01:15:44,122 --> 01:15:45,748
或落葉
or fallen leaves...

803
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:57,051
或是一片海藻
..or pieces of algae.

804
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:14,360
如果你知道如何觀察，偽裝大師無處不在
If you know how to look, the masters of disguise are everywhere.

805
01:16:30,168 --> 01:16:32,753
在這水下伊甸園
In this underwater Garden of Eden,

806
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:37,967
甚至看起來是蛇，其實也是魚而已
even the snake turns out to be a fish.

807
01:16:46,059 --> 01:16:49,895
在海床上，欺騙屢見不鮮
Down on the seabed, deception is commonplace.

808
01:16:56,028 --> 01:17:00,239
單個的珊瑚往往由沙礫區連接
Individual reefs are often connected by areas of sand and rubble,

809
01:17:00,407 --> 01:17:04,785
這是所謂的「底棲地」
and this is where the so-called 'bottom dwellers' dwell.

810
01:17:13,837 --> 01:17:16,589
這裡數量最多的是蝦虎魚
The most numerous of these are the gobies.

811
01:17:19,843 --> 01:17:22,595
超過2000種蝦虎魚
There are over 2,000 species of goby,

812
01:17:22,846 --> 01:17:25,598
使之成為最大的魚類家族之一
making them one of the largest fish families.

813
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,476
很少有能長到超過手指大小的
Few of them grow bigger than your finger,

814
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:32,563
這使它們成為許多掠食魚類的食物
which makes them a favored food for many large predatory fish.

815
01:17:32,731 --> 01:17:37,234
所以它們很警惕，從不遠離海床
So they're always on the lookout and never far from the seabed.

816
01:17:41,698 --> 01:17:43,824
它們大部分時間都用來覓食
They spend most of their days feeding,

817
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:48,371
用腮過濾沙子尋找食物微粒
filtering sand through their gills to extract tiny food particles.

818
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:10,184
對蝦虎魚來說，沙子就是一切
Sand is everything to the goby.

819
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:12,728
沙子提供食物
Sand puts food in their belly

820
01:18:12,896 --> 01:18:15,731
和藏身地
and also a roof above their heads.

821
01:18:18,652 --> 01:18:20,695
許多蝦虎魚建造洞穴
Many gobies build burrows.

822
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:23,447
這是辛苦的挖掘工作
Its tiring excavation work,

823
01:18:23,615 --> 01:18:27,827
合作者們有時在該誰幹活的問題上不能達成一致
and partners sometimes don't agree on whose turn it is.

824
01:18:34,418 --> 01:18:37,336
如果內部問題得不到解決
If the domestic argument can't be worked out,

825
01:18:37,504 --> 01:18:40,756
這種偽裝成大眼睛的蝦虎魚
then this species, camouflaged as big eyes,

826
01:18:40,924 --> 01:18:44,427
會出去閒逛一會兒把問題解決
can always go for a stroll to smooth things over.

827
01:18:47,764 --> 01:18:51,976
有些聰明的蝦虎魚已經找到為之服務的奴隸了
Some clever gobies have enlisted the services of a slave.

828
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:55,271
在這個非凡的夥伴關係中
In a most extraordinary partnership,

829
01:18:55,439 --> 01:19:01,026
蝦虎魚和盲蝦因相互需要而生活一起
gobies and blind shrimp live together, bonded by mutual need.

830
01:19:01,194 --> 01:19:05,698
蝦虎魚藏身在盲蝦挖出的洞穴中
The shrimps excavate a burrow in which the gobies can hide,

831
01:19:05,866 --> 01:19:08,409
蝦則吃它們的殘羹剩飯
and they eat the goby's scraps.

832
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:13,706
蝦虎魚負責放哨，警告靠近危險的蝦
The gobies act as sentinels, warning the shrimps of approaching danger.

833
01:19:20,213 --> 01:19:23,924
魚和甲殼類動物有如此密切的工作關係
The fish and crustacea have such a close working relationship

834
01:19:24,092 --> 01:19:26,177
它們總是通過尾部，鰭或觸角
that they're always connected,

835
01:19:26,344 --> 01:19:29,597
相互聯繫
by tail or fin or feeler.

836
01:19:46,948 --> 01:19:49,366
對於食物鏈底部的魚類
For fish close to the bottom of the food chain,

837
01:19:49,534 --> 01:19:52,161
安全的家是至關重要的
a safe home base is essential.

838
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:56,290
空間有限，好的房地產可謂來之不易
Space is limited and good real estate hard to come by.

839
01:20:06,259 --> 01:20:08,636
擅入領地是不能容忍的
Trespassing isn't tolerated.

840
01:20:22,025 --> 01:20:25,277
領土爭端通常會被快速解決掉
Territorial disputes are normally quick to work out.

841
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:28,489
但也不盡然
But not always.

842
01:20:34,746 --> 01:20:36,914
沒有必要和
There's definitely no point picking a fight

843
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:38,999
這強大的裝甲獸為敵
with this mighty armored beast.

844
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:43,963
棘冠海星是珊瑚的死敵
It's the crown-of-thorns starfish, corals' mortal enemy.

845
01:20:45,173 --> 01:20:49,051
它們把胃吐出，並用胃酸覆蓋珊瑚蟲
By disgorging their stomachs and drenching polyps with acid,

846
01:20:49,219 --> 01:20:53,514
它們吃活珊瑚，把珊瑚蟲從礁石裡吸食出來
they eat living coral and suck the life out of a reef.

847
01:20:54,891 --> 01:20:56,809
海星在清潔空間和促進
The starfish play an important role,

848
01:20:56,977 --> 01:21:00,020
生物多樣性方面扮演了重要角色
clearing space and fostering biodiversity.

849
01:21:00,188 --> 01:21:02,523
很少有和它們同樣地位的生物
And few have stood in their way.

850
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:10,197
海星一直都是自然循環的一部分
The starfish have always been a natural part of the cycle.

851
01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:13,409
但現在不那麼自然了
But now the cycle is unnatural.

852
01:21:13,577 --> 01:21:17,329
農業污染增加了水中的營養
Agricultural pollution has increased nutrients in the water,

853
01:21:17,497 --> 01:21:20,332
引發赤潮（藻華）
which in turn causes algal blooms.

854
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:23,669
幼體海星在享受海藻大餐
Starfish juveniles are feasting on this algae

855
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:26,797
同時越來越多的海星活到成年
and many more are surviving into adulthood.

856
01:21:27,966 --> 01:21:32,011
現在棘冠海星的爆發定期出現在
Plagues of crown-of-thorns starfish are now regularly experienced

857
01:21:32,178 --> 01:21:34,263
全世界的珊瑚礁中
on reefs worldwide.

858
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:47,318
但不是所有的都是壞消息
But not all infestations are bad news.

859
01:21:47,485 --> 01:21:49,737
完美的例子就是有個不尋常的聯盟
A perfect example is the unlikely alliance

860
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:53,115
出現在耳海綿與粉海參之間
between the eared sponge and the pink sea cucumber.

861
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:58,454
這種海綿對大多數生物來說是劇毒的
This sponge is highly toxic to most.

862
01:21:58,622 --> 01:22:02,166
但海參已經適應它，並在此大量聚居
But the sea cucumber has adapted to live here in huge numbers,

863
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:05,002
並跑到海綿邊緣產卵
rising off the edges to spawn.

864
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:10,925
這是一片生物蓬勃生長的不宜居住之地
This is an inhospitable habitat where creatures are thriving.

865
01:22:11,092 --> 01:22:14,887
在不斷變化的海洋裡，這也許提供了生活的希望
Perhaps it offers hope for life in our changing seas.

866
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:18,432
這是萬事皆有可能的絕佳佐證
It's certainly proof that anything is possible.

867
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:30,611
海洋世界永遠在變化
The oceanic world is ever changing.

868
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:34,365
沒有什麼是一成不變的
Nothing stays the same here for more than a moment.

869
01:22:40,622 --> 01:22:44,375
歷史上，珊瑚總是來來去去
Over the ages, corals have come and gone.

870
01:22:44,542 --> 01:22:47,711
今天，它們正在再次消失
Today, they are disappearing again.

871
01:22:48,713 --> 01:22:54,009
但正是人類的存在，使它不同於
But what sets this cycle apart from any other in geological history

872
01:22:54,177 --> 01:22:56,804
地質史上的其他幾次循環
is the presence of us.

873
01:22:58,682 --> 01:23:01,642
珊瑚的生存史上，這是第一次
For the first time in corals' existence,

874
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:05,896
人類直接影響海洋的化學成分
humans are having a direct impact on the ocean's chemistry

875
01:23:06,064 --> 01:23:08,691
和珊瑚的命運
and corals' destiny.

876
01:23:46,938 --> 01:23:48,272
許多科學家認為
Many scientists believe

877
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:51,859
我們正面臨下一個大滅絕
we are heading towards our next mass extinction

878
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:53,944
而且人類就是罪魁禍首
and that humans are the cause.

879
01:23:55,905 --> 01:23:59,116
造礁珊瑚已嚴重瀕危
Reef-building corals are now seriously endangered.

880
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:02,745
當珊瑚礁消失時
And as reefs disappear,

881
01:24:02,912 --> 01:24:08,000
眾多依賴它們的生物也會隨之消失
hundreds of thousands of dependent creatures disappear with them.

882
01:24:20,847 --> 01:24:24,641
此外，珊瑚礁的消亡是海洋死亡的
Furthermore, the demise of coral reefs is a clear indicator

883
01:24:24,809 --> 01:24:26,935
明確指示
that our ocean is dying,

884
01:24:27,103 --> 01:24:31,398
海洋是地球的生命支持系統
and our ocean is our planet's life-support system.

885
01:24:34,819 --> 01:24:37,071
拯救海洋的唯一方法就是
The only way to save our ocean

886
01:24:37,238 --> 01:24:40,157
在未來一二十年內
is to radically curb our CO2 emissions

887
01:24:40,325 --> 01:24:43,077
從根本上遏制二氧化碳的排放量
within the next one or two decades.

888
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:47,498
我們有實現這個目標的所有工具
We have all the tools to do it.

889
01:24:47,665 --> 01:24:51,877
如果我們成功了，將不僅拯救珊瑚礁
And if we succeed, we will not only save our reefs,

890
01:24:52,045 --> 01:24:55,089
最終還會拯救我們自己
we will ultimately save ourselves.

891
01:25:54,023 --> 01:25:57,860
珊瑚的未來，珊瑚的故事如何結束
The future of coral, and how this story ends,

892
01:25:58,027 --> 01:25:59,862
都取決於我們
is up to us.
